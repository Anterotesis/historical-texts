<P>IN the per&s;ecution rai&s;ed again&s;t the Sa|cramentarians (A. D. 1538) John Nichol&s;on, alias Lambert,<NOTE PLACE="inter">An account of John Nichol|&s;on, otherwi&s;e John Lam|bert.</NOTE> was &s;oon made an example of. This man had been mini&s;ter to the Engli&s;h company at Ant|werp, but was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on account of his belief. He afterwards kept a &s;chool at London; and hearing Dr. Taylor preach upon the real pre&s;ence in the euchari&s;t, pre&s;ented him with his rea&s;ons for op|po&s;ing that doctrine. The&s;e were &s;hewn to Cran|mer, who was then of Luther's opinion in that article<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Luther's life, p. 115 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>, and endeavoured to bring Lambert to his way of thinking. Lambert appealed to the King: and his Maje&s;ty, in order to di&s;play his zeal and theo|logical knowledge, undertook to confute him in We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall, before the Bi&s;hops, Nobility, and Judges of the realm. Accordingly, in November, the delin|quent was brought thither, where the trial was opened
<PB N="2" REF="3">by Dr. Day, in a &s;peech, repre&s;enting that the a&s;&s;em|bly was not convened to di&s;pute about any point of faith; but that the King, being &s;upreme head of the church, intended openly to confute and condemn that man's here&s;y (pointing to Lambert) in their pre&s;ence. His Maje&s;ty then commanded the pri&s;oner to declare his &s;entiments about the &s;acrament of the altar: and Lambert began his an&s;wer by a preface, acknowledge|ing the King's great goodne&s;s, that he would thus hear the cau&s;es of his &s;ubjects, and commending his great judgment and learning. Upon this Henry interrupted him, telling him, in Latin, that he came not there to hear his own prai&s;es; and commanded him to &s;peak to the matter. The King a&s;ked him, whether Chri&s;t's body was in the &s;acrament or not? Lambert an&s;wered in the words of St. Au&s;tin, "It was his body in a certain manner:" But Henry ordering him to an&s;wer plainly, he &s;aid, "It was not his body." Upon that the King urged him with the words of &s;cripture, "This is my body;" and then commanded the Archbi&s;hop to con|fute Lambert's opinion. Cranmer &s;poke only to that part of the Sacramentarian's argument which was grounded on the impo&s;&s;ibility of a body's being at two places at one and the &s;ame time, and endeavoured to &s;upport the contrary by mentioning Chri&s;t's appearing to St. Paul, alledging, that tho' Chri&s;t be always in heaven, yet he was &s;een by St. Paul in the air. Lam|bert affirmed, that Chri&s;t was then only in heaven, and that St. Paul heard a voice and &s;aw a vi&s;ion, but not the very body of Chri&s;t. The di&s;pute la&s;ted from twelve to five, during which time Lambert was fre|quently interrupted, and brow-beaten, by his adver&s;a|ries, who extolled, with the mo&s;t extravagant enco|miums, the King's learning, and at la&s;t declared vic|tory on his Maje&s;ty's &s;ide. Lambert, thus confuted, was a&s;ked by Henry, if he was convinced of his error, and whether he would live or die? He an&s;wered, that he was not convinced by any arguments he had heard,
<PB N="3" REF="4">and that he &s;hould "commit his &s;oul to God, and &s;ubmit his body to the King's clemency." His Ma|je&s;ty then told him, if he did not recant, he mu&s;t die, for he would not be a patron to heretics: and becau&s;e he would not do that, Henry ordered Cromwell to read the &s;entence, which he, as the King's vicegerent, did, declaring Lambert an incorrigible heretic, and con|demning him to be burnt. This &s;entence was very &s;oon after executed, with horrid circum&s;tances of bar|barity, in Smithfield, where Lambert expired, crying out, "None but Chri&s;t, None but Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>A. D. 1539.] The adulation be&s;towed on the King, at the conference with Lambert, in&s;pired him with &s;uch an high notion of his own ability, as proved equally fatal to both parties; for he now re&s;olved to puni&s;h rigorou&s;ly all who &s;hould pre&s;ume to di&s;&s;ent from him in point of faith, without making any di&s;|tinction between papi&s;ts or reformers. The intere&s;t of the latter began to decline in&s;en&s;ibly at court &s;ince the death of Queen Jane, who had favoured the progre&s;s of the reformation. Cranmer, however, &s;till kept his footing in the King's good graces by dint of per&s;onal merit; but Cromwell is &s;aid to have minded his own intere&s;t rather than that of religion; Shaxton, Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, was proud and litigious; Latimer, of Worce&s;ter, was weak and &s;imple; Barlow, of St. A&s;aph, &s;hallow and imprudent; and the other preachers of the new religion were generally enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who &s;uffered them&s;elves to be hurried away by an intempe|rate zeal, which paid no regard to the temper and character of their Sovereign, and con&s;equently never failed to incur his indignation. They flattered them|&s;elves, that they had gained an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength by the promotion of Edmund Bonner to the &s;ee of Here|ford, upon the death of Edward Fox: but they were greatly di&s;appointed; for that Prelate, notwith&s;tand|ing the obligations he was under to the chiefs of the
<PB N="4" REF="5">reformation, became one of their mo&s;t rancorous ene|mies.</P>
<P>King Henry now &s;aw him&s;elf without any ally on whom he could depend, &s;ince the Emperor and the King of France had accommodated matters between them&s;elves; for although he had been, for &s;ome years, treating with the Prote&s;tant Princes and cities of Germany, en|gaged in the league of Smalcalde, the negotiations had produced no effect. This was, perhaps, owing to the &s;tiffne&s;s of tho&s;e Princes and &s;tates, who, having enter|ed into what they called a league of religion, in which they entirely agreed among them&s;elves, did not care to unite with &s;uch as differed from them therein; and had refu&s;ed to admit the Prote&s;tant Swi&s;s Cantons into their league, only becau&s;e the&s;e la&s;t, following the doctrines of Zuinglius, did not agree with them in the point of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence in the euchari&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 110 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>. Several years had elap&s;ed, &s;ince they had &s;ent their confe&s;&s;ion of faith to England; and the King, tho' de&s;irous of Me|lancthon's coming over to him, had neither expre&s;&s;ed his approbation thereof, nor declared wherein he di&s;|approved it, nor given them the rea&s;ons of his di&s;&s;ent: and they much di&s;liked &s;everal doctrines, which he continued to encourage in England, not allowing any body to vary from his &s;entiments. He made, how|ever, the la&s;t year, another attempt towards an union: and &s;ent Chri&s;topher Mount to the meeting of the Pro|te&s;tants at Brun&s;wic. His in&s;tructions were, 1&s;t, To &s;ee who engaged in the confederacy; 2dly, Whether their league was for general defence, or limited only to matter of religion; and, 3dly, To require a final an&s;wer, whether they would &s;end over Melancthon, with the great legation they had promi&s;ed. They de|&s;ired to be excu&s;ed in the la&s;t point, becau&s;e they had pre&s;ent u&s;e for their learned divines; and in&s;i&s;ted, that the King &s;hould fir&s;t declare what points he di&s;liked in
<PB N="5" REF="6">their confe&s;&s;ion. As to the other two articles, they &s;aid their league was only in the cau&s;e of religion, and &s;ent the names of the confederates, being twenty-&s;ix cities, and twenty-four Princes; among whom the King of Denmark had been lately admitted. To pre|pare matters, however, for a further treaty, three agents were &s;ent over to di&s;pute with the Engli&s;h di|vines about religion: but, after &s;ome conferences, they were recalled, leaving behind them a remon|&s;trance, touching &s;everal abu&s;es in England, particu|larly, <HI>the communion in one kind only, private ma&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>the celibacy of the clergy.</HI> Again&s;t the&s;e they alledged &s;everal arguments drawn from the &s;criptures, and pri|mitive fathers; and, as their Princes would never ad|mit them, they recommended it to the King to re&s;tore religion in all its primitive purity. Henry was too conceited of his own learning, and too fond of his own opinions, to give up any thing he had adopted: he expected, that the German Prote&s;tants &s;hould con|form to his model of reformation; and, giving the agents no other an&s;wer but what con&s;i&s;ted in defending the points excepted again&s;t, they returned much di&s;|appointed and un&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The German Prote&s;tants refu&s;ing &s;till to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor again&s;t the Turks, unle&s;s he would grant them &s;uch a peace in religion, as might comprehend both the pre&s;ent and future confederates, he formed a league with &s;ome Roman Catholic Princes of the em|pire, in oppo&s;ition to theirs, and for a mutual defence, if mole&s;ted for the Popi&s;h religion. He thought fit, however, to treat with the Prote&s;tants for an accom|modation: but the conference held on that account, this year, at Francfort, came to nothing. Before the i&s;&s;ue was known, the King &s;ent Mount to Germany, "to complain of their treating for a pacification with|out his knowledge, to learn the conditions thereof, and whether they intended to adhere to the doctrine they profe&s;&s;ed." This induced them to &s;end agents
<PB N="6" REF="7">over again to England, to a&s;&s;ure him, "that the pa|cification was not like to take effect, and no conditions had been &s;o much as propo&s;ed; that they &s;hould com|ply with nothing contrary to the Aug&s;bourg confe&s;&s;ion; but, as his Maje&s;ty had enjoined the practice of the very things they had excepted again&s;t, under the &s;eve|re&s;t penalties, they could not, unle&s;s he was plea&s;ed to mitigate them, &s;end over the legation of divines he expected."</P>
<P>They had brought over with them a letter from Melancthon, exhorting him, "to perfect the refor|mation begun, and not hearken to &s;uch as would hin|der it, by in&s;i&s;ting too rigorou&s;ly on ceremonies, and things indifferent; for which rea&s;on he intreated him to mitigate his late proclamation." But Henry, ex|pecting all &s;hould conform to his &s;entiments and orders, was &s;o far from li&s;tening to this advice, that he got the articles in que&s;tion confirmed by his next parliament, under heavier penalties.</P>
<P>Whatever danger the King apprehended from a|broad, he a&s;cribed it all to Cardinal Pole (again&s;t whom he had conceived a mo&s;t violent hatred) as the great inciter of foreign Princes to invade his realm, and to his corre&s;pondences, as giving encouragement to make the attempt. To guard again&s;t it, he laid out con&s;iderable &s;ums in erecting ca&s;tles and forts in dif|ferent parts of the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which he went in per&s;on to view, and in putting his navy in a good condition. He had &s;pies in all places, even in the Cardinal's fa|mily, and, if he did not know all the particulars that pa&s;&s;ed between him and his corre&s;pondents, he yet knew enough to prevent their de&s;igns. It was perhaps a &s;en&s;e of this knowledge, the fear of a detection, or a de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, that induced Sir Geffery Pole, one of the Cardinal's elder brothers, to make a di&s;covery of &s;ome per&s;ons concerned in that corre&s;pondence. The&s;e were, his elde&s;t brother Henry Lord Montacute, Henry Courtenay Marquis of Exeter (cou&s;in-german
<PB N="7" REF="8">to the King, as being &s;on to Catherine, daughter of Edward IV.) Sir Edward Nevil, brother to the Lord Abergavenny, and Sir Nicholas Carew, of Bedding|ton in Surry, Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the King, and Knight of the Garter. The two Lords were tried by their peers, the Lord Chancellor Audely &s;itting as High Steward; and being found guilty, were behead|ed. The two knights had the &s;ame fate; the latter, who having been before a zealous Papi&s;t, had been converted by &s;ome book he read during his impri&s;on|ment, acknowledging, at his execution, the ju&s;tice of God's judgments on him, for the hatred he had bore the go&s;pel, and exhorting every body to read the &s;crip|tures. Two prie&s;ts and a mariner were put to death for the &s;ame offence: but Sir Geffery Pole was par|doned.</P>
<P>Another mea&s;ure the King took, again&s;t the danger he apprehended, was by increa&s;ing his trea&s;ure.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act to con|firm the di&s;&s;o|lution of mo|na&s;teries.</NOTE> It was di&s;puted, whether the head of a body corporate could alone di&s;|&s;olve the corporation, or by a per&s;onal of|fence forfeit its lands; though it appears by the years books, that the Abbot or Prior of a con|vent were, by the law of England, always deemed the only per&s;ons living or capable of acting, in &s;uch a religious body; the re&s;t being dead to the world, and having renounced all property. To remove this doubt, a parliament meeting on April 28, pa&s;&s;ed an act<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stat. 31 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE> to confirm all &s;uch re&s;ignations, &s;urrenders and forfeitures, not only what had already been made, but &s;uch as &s;hould be made hereafter; and to ve&s;t in the King, and his heirs, all their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without any regard to founders, and their heirs, or any exception, either of the appropriate rectories, u&s;urped upon the parochial clergy, to their &s;candalous impoveri&s;hment, and the great detriment of religion,
<PB N="8" REF="9">or of the exemptions from the juri&s;diction of the or|dinary, which tho&s;e mona&s;teries had obtained by papal bulls, to the great ob&s;truction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;ci|pline. The motives, that, be&s;ide the dread of the King's power, either induced the two hou&s;es to pa&s;s this act, or were urged for that purpo&s;e, &s;eem to have been, their hopes of &s;haring in the &s;poils of the mo|na&s;teries, the &s;aving them&s;elves from a tax, to defray the great expences the King was at, in providing for the defence of the realm, again&s;t the croi&s;ade, which the Pope at this time &s;olicited; and the being ex|cu&s;ed for ever from all fifteenths, loans, and &s;ub&s;idies; the revenue added to the crown, by the di&s;&s;olution of religious hou&s;es, being &s;ufficient to enable the King to live on his own, and defend his realm, upon any &s;ud|den inva&s;ion or in&s;urrection, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies on oc|ca&s;ion, to reward his well-de&s;erving &s;ubjects, and to maintain a body of 40,000 di&s;ciplined men, under ex|perienced commanders. In con&s;equence of this act, promi&s;es, threats, pen&s;ions, all manner of ways were employed, to procure &s;uperiors to &s;urrender their hou&s;es: and &s;carce any were proof again&s;t the&s;e temp|tations. Such, as &s;tood out, were made obnoxious on &s;ome other account, as for trea&s;onable corre&s;pondence, bulls from Rome, or refu&s;al of the oath of &s;upre|macy; and were put to death: this was the fate of the abbots of Gla&s;tonbury, Reading and Colche&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stat. 28 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>, and their hou&s;es were, on that pretence, declared to be forfeited. Endeavours were u&s;ed to &s;ave &s;ome, where the religious had been exemplary in their lives, from the general ruin. Latimer interceded for that of Great Malverne, in his dioce&s;e of Worce&s;ter; the gentry of Oxford&s;hire petitioned for the nunnery of God&s;towe, where their daughters were ordinarily educated; and to have kept up &s;ome of the mona&s;teries of men, under other regulations, for a retreat to decayed gentle|men,
<PB N="9" REF="10">and contemplative per&s;ons weary of the world, and of the women for the purpo&s;es here mentioned, would have been a great convenience for the whole kingdom. But none were &s;pared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>: and thus 645 mo|na&s;teries, 90 colleges, 2374 chantries and free chapels, and 110 ho&s;pitals, were di&s;&s;olved; their revenue in land, being valued at 161,100 <ABBR>l</ABBR> a year, and their plate, furniture, &s;tock and per&s;onal e&s;tates, amounting to an immen&s;e &s;um; as may be judged, from the in|&s;tance of St. Edmond&s;bury, whence 5000 marks of gold and &s;ilver were taken, be&s;ides &s;everal jewels of immen&s;e value.</P>
<P>The King had, at Cranmer's &s;ugge&s;tion,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Six new &s;ees founded.</NOTE> formed a &s;cheme for erecting &s;everal new epi&s;copal &s;ees, and for endowing them with the lands of di&s;&s;olved mona&s;teries: and an act<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stat. 31 Hen. VIII. c. 9. Burnet, vol. i. 262, 269.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed for enabling him to execute this de&s;ign. He propo&s;ed to found &s;ixteen: but having di&s;po&s;ed too lavi&s;hly of the lands de&s;tined at fir&s;t for their endow|ment, he erected only &s;ix bi&s;hoprics, viz. of Che&s;ter, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Oxford, Bri&s;tol, Glouce&s;ter and Peter|borough. There were libraries well furni&s;hed with books in &s;everal of the abbeys: and out of the great regard he had for learning, he employed the famous antiquary John Leland to vi&s;it them, and take care of pre&s;erving the mo&s;t valuable manu&s;cripts, and choice&s;t monuments of antiquity. He had propo&s;ed &s;everal other noble foundations, particularly of a col|lege for the &s;tudy of the civil law, and the purity of the Latin and French tongues, and the knowledge of foreign affairs, in order to &s;erve for a &s;eminary of mi|ni&s;ters of &s;tate, and amba&s;&s;adors in foreign countries. There could not be a more favourable opportunity than was now offered for &s;uch in&s;titutions: but Henry's own prodigality, and the greedy appetites of his cour|tiers, prevented this, and other of his be&s;t de&s;igns.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<P>He was not fonder of multiplying his trea&s;ure, than he was, either of extending his prerogative, or of &s;hewing his ab&s;olute power. Of the fir&s;t kind was the act<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stat. 31 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE> for making proclamations, i&s;&s;ued by the King, for the time being, with the advice of council, full as binding upon the &s;ubject (in ca&s;e his e&s;tate, liberty, or per&s;on did not &s;uffer by them) as acts of parliament. Of the later kind was the act of attainder, not only again&s;t the Marquis of Exeter, the Lords Montacute, Darcy, and Hu&s;&s;ey, Sir E. Nevil, Sir N. Carew, Sir Robert Con&s;table, Sir J. Bullmer, Sir Francis Biggot, Sir T. Percy, Sir Stephen Hammerton, the abbots or priors of Whalley, Woburne, Kirk&s;ted, Barlings, Jor|vaux, Bridlington and Lenton, with other gentlemen and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who had been legally convicted, either for trea&s;onable practices, or for being concerned in the late rebellion, but again&s;t others likewi&s;e who had not been &s;o convicted. Pro&s;ecutions indeed had been carried on again&s;t Cardinal Pole, Michael Throck|morton, J. Hilyard, T. Goldwell, and W. Payto, for adhering to the Bi&s;hop of Rome, taking promo|tion from him, and &s;tirring up rebellion in England: and they had been all found guilty. But this does not &s;eem to have been the ca&s;e of Sir Adrian Forte&s;|cue, Sir Thomas Dingley, and &s;everal others, attainted by the &s;ame act, as confederates with the per&s;ons con|victed; there being no mention of any proofs produced again&s;t them, or of their having undergone any trial. Nothing certainly could be more arbitrary, or more dangerous to the life, liberty, and property of every &s;ubject, than the attainder of the&s;e per&s;ons without &s;o much as being heard: though all writers re&s;erve their exclamations on this head, to the ca&s;e of Marga|ret Pole Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, who yet &s;eems to have been &s;ometime before<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE> found guilty of a corre&s;pon|dence with her &s;on the Cardinal (&s;everal of who&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="12">letters, with &s;ome papal bulls, were found in her cabinet) at the &s;ame time that Gertrude Marchio|ne&s;s of Exeter was al&s;o convicted. When the bill of attainder was depending in the hou&s;e of Lords<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 652.</NOTE>, Cromwell produced there a tunic of white &s;ilk, found among the Counte&s;s's linen, on the front whereof were painted the arms of England, and in the back part, the five wounds of Chri&s;t, or the in|&s;ignia on the banner of the late northern rebels. Ger|trude was pardoned at the later end of this year; but Margaret, after being two years in pri&s;on, was be|headed.</P>
<P>Gardiner, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act of the &s;ix Articles, or the &s;tatute of blood.</NOTE> had been amba&s;&s;ador &s;everal years abroad, either at the French or Imperial courts; and had in that time probably reconciled him&s;elf to the Pope<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. 251.</NOTE>, who&s;e intere&s;ts he &s;ecretly favoured. He was an artful man, knew the King perfectly well, and cho&s;e always proper &s;ea&s;ons for moving him in any point, that he wanted to carry. He had done no great &s;ervice in his emba&s;&s;ies, and had left the courts, where he had been employed, out of humour with Henry: to whom he repre&s;ented, that it was owing to the &s;u&s;picion they had entertained of his deviating not only from the government of the church of Rome, but from the faith there received, and nothing would re-e&s;tabli&s;h a good under&s;tanding with them &s;o ea&s;ily, as by &s;hewing his zeal for the received doctrines. Others about court, who were concealed friends of the papacy, improved this &s;ugge&s;tion; and put the King upon hearing the cau&s;e of Lambert before-men|tioned. His Maje&s;ty's arguments, learning, and judg|ment were extolled to the &s;kies; and to convince the world of his adherence to the Roman faith, &s;ix arti|cles, much controverted at that time, and &s;ome of them rejected by the Lutherans, were to be e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="12" REF="13">by parliament, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lords Journals.</NOTE> On May 5 it was referred to Cromwell, the two Arch|bi&s;hops, the Bi&s;hops of Durham, Bath, Carli&s;le, Ely, Bangor, and Worce&s;ter, to con&s;ider how to extirpate the diver&s;ity of opinions in matter of religion: but, they not agreeing in their &s;entiments, the Duke of Nor|folk, on the &s;ixteenth of that month, moved the Hou&s;e of Lords, that &s;ix articles, which he had to propo&s;e, &s;hould be examined in full parliament, where every per&s;on might &s;peak his opinion, that &s;o a determina|tion might be made, and a penal &s;tatute enacted, for the better ob&s;ervation thereof.

<ITEM>"1. That, in the &s;acrament of the altar, the natural body and blood of Chri&s;t, conceived of the Virgin Mary, is really pre&s;ent, under the form of bread and wine; and that, after the con&s;ecration, there remains no &s;ub|&s;tance of bread or wine, nor any other &s;ub&s;tance, but the &s;ub&s;tance of Chri&s;t, God and Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the com|munion in both kinds is not nece&s;&s;ary for &s;alvation, by the law of God, to all per&s;ons; and that the very blood is in the fle&s;h under the form of bread, and the very fle&s;h in the blood under the form of wine, as well apart, as if they were both together.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That prie&s;ts, after their ordination, might not marry by the law of God; and that by the &s;ame law,</ITEM>

</LIST> By the bill brought in, pur&s;uant to this determination, all that, after next July 12, &s;hould preach, di&s;pute, or &s;peak, again&s;t the doctrines of either tran&s;ub&s;tantiation or concomitancy, were to be judged heretics, and, without any abjura|tion, be burnt immediately, and their e&s;tates forfeited as in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on. Whoever ob&s;tinately
<PB N="13" REF="14">maintained any thing contrary to the other articles, was to be puni&s;hed as if guilty of felony: as prie&s;ts al&s;o were, and &s;uch as had vowed cha&s;tity, if they married. The bare declaring of a per&s;on's opinion on the &s;ame heads, contrary to the act, was puni&s;hable in the fir&s;t offence by the forfeiture of goods and chattels, and in the &s;econd was made capital. The marriages of prie&s;ts were to be declared null, and if they lay, or openly conver&s;ed with their wives, after July 12, it was made felony. Such as kept other women, for|feited their preferment, and if afterwards they repeated their offence, were to be hanged as felons; the women, with whom they committed the offence, being to &s;uffer the &s;ame puni&s;hment. Ab&s;taining from confe&s;&s;ion, and from receiving the euchari&s;t at the accu&s;tomed times, &s;ubjected a per&s;on to fine and impri&s;onment at the King's plea&s;ure, and, after a &s;econd conviction, to death and forfeiture, as in ca&s;es of felony.</P>
<P>Such was the cruel act of the &s;ix articles, incon|&s;i&s;tent in &s;ome points with what Henry had recom|mended formerly; but expedient for him, at this juncture, to convince foreign Princes of his catholicity. It was to be read once a quarter, in every pari&s;h-church throughout the kingdom: and commi&s;&s;ioners were ap|pointed, in every county, to put it rigorou&s;ly in exe|cution. Shaxton and Latimer, as &s;oon as it pa&s;&s;ed, re|&s;igned the &s;ees of Chiche&s;ter and Worce&s;ter. The adherents of the papacy were &s;o intent upon its exe|cution, that they got 500 per&s;ons to be taken up immediately: but Cromwell, repre&s;enting the evil con|&s;equences of &s;o violent a proceeding, procured a pardon for them; only the two prelates were long confined in pri&s;on. Cranmer had oppo&s;ed the act to the la&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 249, 266, 270. in Coll. No. 11. 15.</NOTE>; and, when his rea&s;ons could not prevail to throw it out, gave his vote again&s;t its pa&s;&s;ing, though the King would have excu&s;ed his ab&s;ence. His ene|mies,
<PB N="14" REF="15">imagined, that they had got a great advantage over him, and an handle for working his ruin: but, &s;ending away his wife to her uncle O&s;iander in Ger|many, he went on in his old way, addre&s;&s;ing the King with his u&s;ual frankne&s;s and &s;incerity, which had at fir&s;t recommended him to Henry, and &s;till continued him in his good graces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the &s;anguinary act above-mentioned, the parliament pa&s;&s;ed two other remarkable &s;tatutes, viz. for &s;ettling the prece|dency and ranks of the peers and great officers of &s;tate; by which Cromwell, though the &s;on of a black&s;mith, or brewer, at Putney, obtained the fir&s;t place after the Princes of the blood: and for enable|ing the religious of di&s;&s;olved mona&s;teries to hold lands and tenements, and to &s;ue and be &s;ued in all actions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Private per|&s;ons allowed to have Bibles in their fami|lies.</NOTE> There appeared &s;oon after a very remark|able effect of Cranmer's credit with the King. He obtained, on November 13, letters-pa|tent, under the great &s;eal for allowing all per&s;ons to purcha&s;e Engli&s;h Bibles, and keep them in their hou&s;es. The Bible, tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h by the royal authority, had been printed the foregoing year by Richard Graf$on at London; and the King had paid for 1500 copies of the impre&s;&s;ion. One of the&s;e was to be placed in every church, chained &s;o as not to be embezzled; to be read by all per&s;ons within his dominions, without controul or hazard; for which Cromwell had got the King's war|rant. What Cranmer obtained, was a more general liberty: and whereas before a &s;ingle copy &s;erved for the u&s;e of a whole pari&s;h, every pari&s;hioner was now enabled to have a Bible for his own family, to read it at lei&s;ure, to examine it carefully, to compare one pa&s;&s;age with another, and to con&s;ider upon the whole what was the true meaning of any part of &s;cripture. As nothing contributed more to the reformation, than the knowledge of the &s;criptures, it is ea&s;y to imagine how &s;erviceable the free u&s;e of them, thus procured
<PB N="15" REF="16">by Cranmer, was to that end, by making them more generally known to the people.</P>
<P>A. D. 1540.] The exterior marks of a perfect union between the Emperor and Francis,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry mar|ries and di|vorces Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> alarmed the King of England to the highe&s;t degree. He &s;u&s;pected &s;ome de|&s;ign had been formed between them to his prejudice: and re&s;olved, as well to unite with the German Pro|te&s;tants, if they would come to &s;ome accord in points of religion, as to marry Anne of Cleves. When &s;he landed at Roche&s;ter the King went thither incognito to &s;ee her, and found her &s;o different from her picture, which had been drawn by Hans Holbein, that, in the impatience of his di&s;appointment, he &s;wore they had brought him a <HI>Flanders mare.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, re|flecting that her brother the Duke of Cleves was the Emperor's neighbour in the Low Countries, and his competitor for the duchy of Guelderland; and that her &s;i&s;ter was married to the Duke of Saxony, chief of the league of Smalcalde; and that the Emperor was then at Paris negotiating with the French Monarch; he would not run the ri&s;k of affronting two &s;uch powerful Princes, at a time when he might &s;tand in need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and therefore he wed|ded Anne on January 6 at Greenwich. After that &s;o|lemnity, the royal pair were bedded: but this, in&s;tead of curing the aver&s;ion he had contracted for her at fir&s;t &s;ight, only &s;erved to augment it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The day after the nuptials, when Cromwell a&s;ked Henry how he liked his new bed-fellow, his Maje&s;ty declared to him in confi|dence, that he liked her wor&s;e than ever; that he &s;u&s;pected &s;he was no maid; that &s;he had un&s;avoury &s;mells about her; and that he believed he &s;hould never be able to con&s;ummate his marriage.</NOTE>. He re|&s;olved to be divorced from her at any rate: and he was the more encouraged to take that &s;tep, becau&s;e, having &s;ent the Duke of Norfolk, after the Emperor had quitted France, to make a league with Francis, he had found the la&s;t of the&s;e Princes very diffident of
<PB N="16" REF="17">the other, and di&s;po&s;ed enough to renew ho&s;tilities; though he did not care to come to an open rupture, till he knew the fate of the promi&s;ed inve&s;titure of Milan. Princes &s;eldom want pretences for executing any of their re&s;olutions: and a pre-contract for a mar|riage between Anne of Cleves and the young Prince of Lorrain, was now made u&s;e of to invalidate Henry's marriage. It doth not appear, whether that contract was made in words of the pre&s;ent or future ten&s;e, or whether it was more than a bare agreement or de&s;tina|tion of their parents: if it was, the proofs, &s;aid to be produced of its being afterwards &s;et a&s;ide, by an|other convention or agreement of the &s;ame parents, or by a declaration of the Duke of Gueldres, who in|termeddled in the affair, were not &s;ufficient to de&s;troy its obligation. However this matter was, the parlia|ment which met on April 12, thought fit, on July 6, to addre&s;s the King, that he would give orders for a trial of the validity of his marriage: and a commi&s;|&s;ion was immediately i&s;&s;ued for its being tried in the convocation. Two days were &s;pent in examining witne&s;&s;es to prove, "that there had been a pre-con|tract between the Queen and the Prince of Lorrain; that the King had married her again&s;t his will, and without the inward con&s;ent of his mind; and that the marriage had not been con&s;ummated." The proof of this la&s;t particular re&s;ted chiefly upon Henry's own di&s;po&s;ition, though it was what the Queen her|&s;elf al&s;o acknowledged; canoni&s;ts had often &s;et a&s;ide marriages on all the&s;e accounts: and matters of this nature being u&s;ually &s;ubmitted to their judgment, the convocation, in which great numbers of that profe&s;&s;ion &s;at, agreed unanimou&s;ly, on July 9, in pronouncing the King's marriage null and invalid. This &s;entence was delivered the next day in writing to the two hou&s;es of parliament; and Henry &s;ent the day following, the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Southampton, and the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, to give
<PB N="17" REF="18">the Queen an account of what had been done; and to a&s;&s;ure her, that he would, by letters-patent, declare her his adopted &s;i&s;ter; a title giving her precedence before all the ladies of England, except his Queen and daughters; and would &s;ettle on her for life the palace of Richmond, with a revenue of 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per annum,</HI> which &s;he might enjoy either in England, or abroad, at her option. Anne was naturally dull and phlegmatic, altogether un&s;killed in mu&s;ic, which was always agreeable to Henry: and as &s;he had found very little matrimonial comfort or &s;atisfaction, readily ac|cepted the offer; &s;igned her con&s;ent, and approba|tion of the &s;entence; and cho&s;e to live in England, rather than to return, thus di&s;graced, into her own country. She wrote likewi&s;e to her brother, expre&s;&s;ing her approbation of what had been done; extolling the King's goodne&s;s to her; de&s;iring him and her other friends not to take the matter ill; and hoping it would cau&s;e no interruption of their friend&s;hip. A bill was, on July 12, brought into parliament, for annulling the marriage, and allowing the parties to marry again, pur&s;uant to the &s;entence of the convocation: and it readily pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The King lo&s;t no time in making u&s;e of the liberty of re-marrying;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry weds Catherine Howard.</NOTE> and having privately e&s;pou&s;ed Catherine, daughter of the Lord Edmond Howard, brother to the Duke of Norfolk, declared her publickly his Queen, on Augu&s;t 8, at Hampton-Court.</P>
<P>The fall of Cromwell, happening at the &s;ame time as the divorce, is generally imputed to the great hand he had in making the match with Anne of Cleves, and to the King's re&s;entment on that account. Henry was certainly much out of humour on that occa&s;ion, and had abundant rea&s;on to complain of &s;uch as had abu&s;ed him by fal&s;e repre&s;entations of her beauty and perfections; yet none of the&s;e, nor any one el&s;e con|cerned in advi&s;ing or tran&s;acting the marriage, be&s;ides
<PB N="18" REF="19">Cromwell, ever felt any effects of his anger. It &s;eems much more natural to a&s;cribe both the&s;e events to the power of the imperial faction in the court of England, particularly to the Duke of Norfolk, and to the new pa&s;&s;ion which the King had entertained for this noble|man's niece, Catherine Howard; who now &s;erved him as effectually for the ruin of Cromwell, as Anne Bo|leyn, another of his nieces, had formerly for that of Wol&s;ey. The match with Cleves was con&s;idered as an introduction to a league with the Prote&s;tant Princes of Germany; which would have defeated all the Em|peror's &s;chemes for rendering him&s;elf ab&s;olute in that country: it behoved this Prince to &s;et all his agents and partizans at work to defeat this alliance, and pre|vent the effects it might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce. The Duke of Norfolk had been always in his intere&s;ts; and &s;erved him very well at this juncture: he was an utter enemy to the German league, becau&s;e it was very likely to promote a reformation, to which he was extremely aver&s;e. He had lately at Archbi&s;hop Cranmer's table quarrelled with Cromwell; and u&s;ed &s;uch bitter &s;arca&s;ms and outrageous language to him, as could not ea&s;ily be dige&s;ted, and were plain decla|rations of the mortal hatred he bore to this mini&s;ter, who&s;e highe&s;t po&s;t then was that of Lord Privy Seal. This violent proceeding might perhaps tempt people to think, that the Duke was able to carry his point again&s;t Cromwell, e&s;pecially &s;ince he had got Stephen Gardiner Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, Cuthbert Ton&s;tal of Durham, and John Clark of Bath, recalled to court, and &s;worn of the privy council; de&s;igning the la&s;t for the po&s;t of Lord Privy Seal, and the &s;econd for vicar-general. The &s;ervants of the mini&s;ter, who&s;e &s;poils were thus to be di&s;po&s;ed of, were of opinion, that though their ma&s;ter might not keep the title of vicar-general (which was generally odious) yet he would maintain his credit with the King, being very a&s;&s;iduous in his affairs, and doing nothing without fir&s;t com|municating
<PB N="19" REF="20">it to his Maje&s;ty. Whatever efforts were made again&s;t him, Cromwell doth not &s;eem to have been &s;unk at all in his ma&s;ter's good graces, when the parliament met on April 12; having but two days before obtained from him a grant of thirty manors, parcel of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;everal di&s;&s;olved mona&s;teries. On the &s;eventeenth of the month, he was created Earl of E&s;&s;ex, and, in a day or two after, Lord High Chamberlain of England (dignities that had fallen va|cant, in the foregoing month, by the extinction of the male line of the Bourchiers, and the death of John Vere Earl of Oxford); and his &s;on Gregory, being called up by writ to the hou&s;e of Lords, took his place there as Lord Cromwell, the &s;ame day his father was introduced into it by his new title of E&s;&s;ex. The bill for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the knights of the order of <HI>St. John of Jeru&s;alem</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the taking of Jeru&s;alem from the Saracens, certain Chri&s;|tian merchants of Naples got leave, in 1012, from the Caliph of Egypt, to erect, for the entertainment of them&s;elves and their countrymen, a &s;mall hou&s;e and oratory near the church of the holy &s;epulchre. To them repaired certain canons of the order of <HI>St. Augu&s;tin,</HI> who built another oratory; but the number of the pilgrims increa&s;ing, they erected a large ho&s;pital on the &s;pot where our Saviour celebrated the pa&s;chal &s;upper; and taking St. John Bapti&s;t for their patron, were called <HI>Ho&s;pitallers of</HI> St. John <HI>of Jeru&s;alem.</HI> By a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Eu|rope, they oppo&s;ed the attacks of the Infidels till 1099, when God|frey of Bouillon came to their relief, and took the holy city from the Egyptian Caliph. Their order was confirmed before 1117, by Pope Pa&s;cal II. who granted them, by &s;pecial order, the &s;ole right of electing a &s;uperior, after the death of Gerhard the then &s;uperior, who enjoined that the religious of his order &s;hould wear a plain black robe with a white linen cro&s;s of eight points affixed to it. Upon Gerhard's de|cea&s;e, A.D. 1118, the ho&s;pitallers elected Raimond Dupuy, a Florentine, for their head; and he was the fir&s;t who took the title of grand-ma&s;ter. They entertained poor pilgrims in their ho&s;pital at Jeru&s;alem, keeping the pa&s;&s;age thither &s;afe; and charitably buried the dead. They were at fir&s;t very lowly, their m$&s;ter &s;tiling him&s;elf <HI>&s;ervant to he poor &s;er|vitors of the ho&s;pital of Jeru&s;alem:</HI> but, by the bounty and devotion of Princes and private per&s;ons, they had, about the year 1240, no le&s;s than 19,000 lord&s;hips and manors in different parts of Chri&s;tendom. After they were totally expelled from Pale&s;tine in 1291, they took up their re&s;idence in Cyprus until the year 1310, when they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Rhodes, and from the conque&s;t of that i&s;land were &s;tiled <HI>Knights of Rhodes.</HI> This title they pre&s;erved together with their ha|bitation until the year 1522, when Solyman II. Emperor of the Turks, &s;ubdued their i&s;land: after which the grand-ma&s;ter went to Rome, and the re&s;t of the knights were di&s;per&s;ed in divers places, until the Emperor Charles V. gave them the i&s;le of Malta, to hold in fief of him, by charter dated March 24, 1530, and then they a&s;&s;umed the &s;tile of <HI>Knights of Malta,</HI> which they &s;till maintain. The order formerly con&s;i&s;ted of eight tongues or nations, but now only of &s;even, &s;ince England &s;eparated from the church of Rome. The heads of each nation, or the grand-cro&s;&s;es, are called grand-priors, each having convents of knights, and e&s;tates appropriated for their maintenance, in every Popi&s;h nation: and by them the grand-ma&s;ters are elected. The knights, who are computed to be about 3000 in number, and mu&s;t be of antient noble families, are &s;ubject in &s;pirituals to the Pope, and live according to the rule of St. Augu&s;tin. They are, among other engagements, obliged to &s;up|port a continual war again&s;t the Mahometans, and al&s;o again&s;t pi|rates; for which they are often denominated the champions of Chri&s;|tendom. Their chief re&s;idence, in England, was at Clerkenwell near London. It was founded by John Bri&s;et, and in time became &s;o great, that it re&s;embled a palace, and had a fine church, and a tower-&s;teeple, of curious workman&s;hip, rai&s;ed &s;o high, that, while it &s;tood, it was a &s;ingular ornament to the city. The grand-prior in England was reputed the fir&s;t baron of the land. When the templars were extirpated, in the reign of Edward II. they got a gift of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and outlived all the religious orders in England, until they were this year aboli&s;hed on pretence of their dependence on the Pope and Emperor. All their effects in England and Ireland were confi&s;cated to the King, who allowed 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearly for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; of which 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> were allotted to Sir William We&s;ton, the grand-prior, who was &s;o affected with the di&s;&s;olution of his priory, that he did not live to receive his pen&s;ion, and lies buried in Clerken|well church. The remaining 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> were di&s;tributed among the other members, in appointments from 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> according to their &s;everal qualities and de&s;erts.</NOTE>, and a grant of four fifteenths and tenths
<PB N="20" REF="21">to be paid in as many years, and of two &s;ub&s;idies, each a &s;hilling in the pound, are a&s;cribed to his ma|nagement; and he appears to have acted as principal mini&s;ter all the &s;e&s;&s;ion, till May 14; when the parlia|ment (on account of the fe&s;tival of Whit&s;untide, and to allow the Bi&s;hops and clergy time to fini&s;h their in&s;tructions for the union of the Chri&s;tian world) was
<PB N="21" REF="22">prorogued to the twenty-fifth of that month. Nor doth there appear to have been any change in his &s;itu|ation when the parliament met again, nor even any formed re&s;olution for vacating the King's marriage with Anne of Cleves (whatever wi&s;hes or de&s;igns of that kind Henry might have before entertained) &s;ince, on the day la&s;t named, a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of Peers, for &s;ettling a jointure on her as Queen of England, and pa&s;&s;ed <HI>nemine contradicente.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by Cromwell's letter, wrote in the Tower, on Saturday June 12, that, within the pa&s;t fortnight, the Queen's German maid-&s;ervants had been &s;ent away; that he had u&s;ed in&s;tances with her Lord Chamberlain, and others of her council, to per&s;uade her to a better behaviour towards his Maje&s;ty; and that the King had entru&s;ted to him a matter of &s;ecre&s;y relating to her, which he was charged with revealing, though he vin|dicated him&s;elf very well from that accu&s;ation. But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages do not account &s;ufficiently for that mi|ni&s;ter's &s;udden fall, and the Queen's as &s;udden divorce; which, happening together, &s;eem to have been the con|&s;equence of a &s;imultaneous re&s;olution: and yet what el&s;e fell out within that &s;pace of time, is matter of pro|bable conjecture, rather than ab&s;olute certainty, through the &s;ilence of cotemporary writers on the &s;ubject. The&s;e writers take notice of Cromwell's low birth, and his being rai&s;ed, purely by the &s;trength and merit of his natural parts, without any education or the &s;upport of friends, to the highe&s;t dignities and tru&s;ts in the kingdom; which con&s;equently expo&s;ed him to the envy of the nobility, even if he had been le&s;s haughty than he is repre&s;ented. They ob&s;erve that the &s;hare he had in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries, and in pro|moting the reformation, had rendered him odious to all the Popi&s;h party; that even the reformed were di&s;|contented with him, when they found he could not pro|tect them from burning; and that the common peo|ple hated him for having gotten from the parliament,
<PB N="22" REF="23">again&s;t their wills, the late above-mentioned grants of a &s;ub&s;idy, and four fifteenths and tenths, be&s;ides an|other &s;ub&s;idy of four &s;hillings in the pound from the clergy, at a time when they imagined them&s;elves &s;ecure from the danger of new taxes, by the va&s;t aug|mentation which the lands of di&s;&s;olved mona&s;teries had made of the crown revenues. The&s;e, after all, were no rea&s;ons why the King &s;hould treat a mini&s;ter of his abi|lities, who had done him &s;uch extraordinary &s;ervices, in the manner he did; though perhaps they might encourage his enemies to accu&s;e him of having, in others, acted without the King's expre&s;s knowledge or licence. It was impo&s;&s;ible for any man, who had med|dled &s;o much in great and public affairs, not to mi&s;|take, forget, or err in various ca&s;es and manners, &s;o as to be obnoxious in point of law, when a &s;evere in|qui&s;ition &s;hould be made into his conduct. Thus he was accu&s;ed, "of &s;etting per&s;ons at liberty, who had either been convicted of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, upon the late &s;tatutes, or were in pri&s;on upon &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;on; of granting licences for carrying corn, leather, beer, tallow, and other commodities, out of the realm, con|trary to the King's proclamation, and for per&s;ons to go abroad, with hor&s;es, and money, without &s;earch; and of deputing commi&s;&s;ioners in weighty ca&s;es within the realm, without his knowledge or a&s;&s;ent, and in confi|dence of his approbation." No mention is made of any particular in&s;tance of the&s;e offences, which would probably have appeared upon accu&s;ation to be incon&s;i|derable matters, if not &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable: and to touch his life, it was nece&s;&s;ary to charge him with here&s;y and trea&s;on. To &s;upport the fir&s;t of the&s;e charges it was &s;aid, "That he had di&s;per&s;ed over the realm erro|neous books, printed as well abroad as in England, about the &s;acrament of the altar, and other articles of religion, pronouncing the doctrines therein to be good, and &s;aying every Chri&s;tian might admini&s;ter the &s;acra|ment, as well as a prie&s;t; that he had, as the King's
<PB N="23" REF="24">Vicegerent in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, licen&s;ed, without his knowledge, &s;everal per&s;ons, detected or &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y, to preach openly; that he had ordered many heretics, &s;ome indicted, others apprehended on the complaints of credible per&s;ons, to be &s;et at liberty; that he had &s;creened heretics, &s;pecially accu&s;ed, from puni&s;hment, and had either impri&s;oned or rebuked the accu&s;ers &s;o &s;harply, that people were afraid of inform|ing again&s;t heretics." The charge of trea&s;on was founded upon the overt-act of drawing out his dagger, to give an empha&s;is to &s;ome words he was &s;aid to have &s;poken, two years before, in private conver&s;ation, ex|pre&s;&s;ing a re&s;olution "to &s;tand by the cau&s;e of the reformation, in the field, &s;word-in-hand, again&s;t the King and all others." The&s;e he ab&s;olutely denied; nor were they indeed con&s;i&s;tent with that temper, modera|tion, and prudence, which were remarkable in all his actions: and as they were laid at that di&s;tance of time, by per&s;ons who had not &s;een him afterwards, and had been &s;o long concealed, there is a good deal of rea&s;on to think they were invented purely to furni&s;h his ene|mies with a pretence to take away the life of a mini&s;ter, who&s;e abilities and eminent &s;ervices rendered him a for|midable rival, even under di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the pretences for putting Cromwell to death: but the re&s;olution for that &s;tep, and for the Queen's divorce, was probably owing to other motives. The Emperor had long wi&s;hed to be reconciled to Henry, and had amu&s;ed him with various offers to engage him in his intere&s;t, and in an alliance again&s;t France: and his amba&s;&s;adors, at the court of England, watched and improved all opportunities for that purpo&s;e. A very fair one was at this time furni&s;hed them by the King of France; who, too de&s;irous to oblige the Emperor in his late pa&s;&s;age thro' that kingdom, had, in the open|ne&s;s of his heart, made him a confident of all the mo&s;t &s;ecret particulars that had pa&s;&s;ed in his negotiations with Henry, and of all the offers which this Prince had
<PB N="24" REF="25">made to engage him in a league again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Francis &s;oon repented of this indi&s;cretion; and the ill-humour it put him in, occa&s;ioned the di&s;|grace of his favourite mini&s;ters, the Con&s;table de Mont|morency and Admiral Chabot. Henry could never forgive it; and the di&s;covery thereof was the principal means made u&s;e of by the Emperor, to draw the King of England over to his intere&s;ts, and to engage him af|terwards in an alliance again&s;t Francis. The di&s;covery appears, from all circum&s;tances, to have been made about this time; and Henry re&s;olving, in the height of his re&s;entment, to unite with the Emperor, had no occa&s;ion for a league with the Prote&s;tant Princes of Germany, to which his religious principles rendered him aver&s;e, and nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs could make him &s;ubmit. It happened at the &s;ame time that he took a liking to Catherine Howard, who had beauty enough to &s;trike his fancy: and though &s;he had neither virtue, nor a con&s;titution, capable of holding out long again&s;t a Prince's court&s;hip; yet Gardiner, and the Duke of Norfolk, with her other relations, managed matters &s;o well, that the King grew enamour|ed of her per&s;on. His pa&s;&s;ions, ever violent, made him impatient to enjoy the object beloved; Catherine had rea&s;ons to have her marriage hurried over privately, before the King's flame for her came to be the &s;ubject of public di&s;cour&s;e: her relations, knowing how much Henry was influenced by the wives he liked, pu&s;hed it on with all their credit, and incited him to remove the ob&s;tacles to his happine&s;s, by vacating his marriage with Anne of Cleves, and by de&s;troying the author of it, who had drawn him into the noo&s;e, and who&s;e ruin was nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ecurity. The King never &s;cru|pled any mea&s;ures, nor minded the con&s;equences there|of, when his will was in que&s;tion; ob&s;tructions &s;erved only to whet his fury for removing them: hence aro&s;e the re&s;olution for the divorce of Anne, the private
<PB N="25" REF="26">marriage of Catherine, and the getting rid of Crom|well.</P>
<P>This mini&s;ter was, on Friday, June 11, about three in the afternoon, arre&s;ted by the Chancellor and Lords of the privy council, in the King's palace at We&s;t|min&s;ter; and carried thence to the Tower of London. His fortitude &s;eemed to for&s;ake him at this juncture: being required to &s;end to the King a full account of his tran&s;actions in his Maje&s;ty's marriage with Anne of Cleves, he concluded his letter in the mo&s;t abject man|ner. He &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf a mo&s;t woeful pri&s;oner, ready to take the death, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God and his Maje&s;ty; yet, he &s;aid, the frail fle&s;h incited him continually to call to his grace for mercy, and grace for his offences. He dated the letter "At the Tower, this Wedne&s;day the la&s;t of June, with the heavy heart and trembling hand of your Highne&s;s's mo&s;t heavy and mo&s;t mi&s;erable pri&s;oner, and poor &s;lave, Thomas Cromwell:" and below the &s;ub&s;cription he wrote, "Mo&s;t gracious Prince, I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy." His enemies had cooked up a charge again&s;t him; but con&s;cious of the weakne&s;s of their proofs, at lea&s;t in the capital articles, and fearing that what irregularities had been committed in the execution of his offices, might appear, on examination, to have been for the King's &s;ervice, and, perhaps, agreeable to the general tenor of his commands and in&s;tructions, did not care that he &s;hould be admitted to make his defence. A &s;horter method, again&s;t which no inno|cence could be proof, was taken: a bill for his at|tainder was brought, on June 17, into the hou&s;e of Lords; and, being pa&s;&s;ed after three readings, was &s;ent on the 19th to the Commons for their concurrence. This was not &s;o readily granted as might have been expected; ten days pa&s;&s;ed before the Commons &s;ent back (as was u&s;ually done in &s;uch ca&s;es) the bill, which they did not approve: but they &s;ent with it a new bill of their own framing, which they had pa&s;&s;ed, and an|nexed
<PB N="26" REF="27">to it a provi&s;o about the deanery of Wells. This new bill, coming up to the Lords on the 26th, was read thrice, and the provi&s;o as often, the &s;ame day, and pa&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir E. Coke &s;ays he was told by Sir T. Gaudy, a Ju&s;tice at that time of the King's Bench, that Cromwell had, &s;ome time before, been ordered by the King to attend the Chief Ju&s;tices, and a&s;k their opinions, "Whether a man in pri&s;on, and forth-coming, might be attainted by parliament, without being called to an&s;wer?" And the Judges, after &s;aying, "It was a dangerous que&s;tion, and they thought a parliament would never do it," being pre&s;&s;ed to a more direct reply, declared their opinion, "That if he was attained by parliament, it could not be que&s;tioned, whether he was called to an&s;wer or not." The relation adds, "That the party again&s;t whom this was intended was never que&s;tioned: and the fir&s;t man that &s;uf|fered by that proceeding was Cromwell him&s;elf." This &s;tory &s;eems calculated to le&s;&s;en the horror of that mini&s;ter's treatment: but, if it be true, it doth no great honour to the Judges; who mu&s;t be very ignorant, if they did not know, that the attainders of Roger Morti|mer, Earl of Marche, and of &s;everal others, by parliament, had been repealed on this very account, of the parties not being called to an|&s;wer, nor heard in their defence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cromwell's chief fault was an exce&s;s of ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s to the King's plea&s;ures, the effect of an inordinate zeal for his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice. In other re&s;pects, he is &s;carce &s;ufficiently to be admired, for his prodigious parts, excellent judgment, infinite application to bu|&s;ine&s;s, wonderful dexterity in the management of af|fairs, great moderation in the exerci&s;e of his authority, calmne&s;s of temper in his dealings with all per&s;ons, and under provocations &s;ufficient to ruffle the &s;edate&s;t per|&s;on; an uncommon genero&s;ity and noblene&s;s of mind, notwith&s;tanding the meanne&s;s of his extraction, and for an unexampled conde&s;cen&s;ion in the height of his pomp, vouch&s;afing to take notice of his old acquain|tance, and &s;hew his gratitude for favours formerly re|ceived. A mini&s;ter in di&s;grace finds few per&s;ons gene|rous enough to intercede in his behalf: Cranmer was the only one that di&s;charged the part of a true friend on this occa&s;ion, having written a very moving letter
<PB N="27" REF="28">to the King in his behalf, declaring his firm belief of Cromwell's innocence from any di&s;loyal meaning, and wi&s;hing his Maje&s;ty might find another coun&s;ellor equal to him in capacity, diligence, and fidelity. There were few &s;uch to be met with; and the King is &s;aid afterwards to have lamented his lo&s;s. The parlia|ment was di&s;&s;olved on July 24, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome other acts for the attainder of Lord Hungerford, and &s;eve|ral other per&s;ons; for the regulating &s;anctuaries, and reducing their number; and for repealing the penalty of death, denounced by the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, again&s;t incontinent prie&s;ts and their women. They likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed an act, ordaining, that a marriage, al|ready con&s;ummated, &s;hould not be di&s;&s;olved on ac|count of any pre-contract, uncon&s;ummated, or any other hindrances than tho&s;e of the divine law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;tatute, which &s;o palpably contradicted the King's own conduct in the ca&s;es of his wives, was intended as a previous &s;tep to|wards legitimating the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, and his marriage with Catherine Howard, who was cou&s;in-german to Anne Boleyn: for, by the canon law, a marriage in that degree was prohibited, with|out a &s;pecial di&s;pen&s;ation fir&s;t obtained.</NOTE>. The commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by his Maje&s;ty to examine the doctrines of religion, having drawn up a long re|port upon that &s;ubject, a &s;tatute was enacted, imply|ing, that their report &s;hould have the force of a law, as well as every thing that the King &s;hould ordain con|cerning religion. By this act they &s;ubjected their con|&s;ciences to the will and plea&s;ure of their Sovereign, and ve&s;ted him with that infallibility which they denied to the Pope. This complai&s;ant a&s;&s;embly al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an act for erecting a court of wards, and at la&s;t one for a general amne&s;ty, from which were excepted the Coun|te&s;s of Sali&s;bury and Cromwell, as well as tho&s;e con|victed of having denied the King's &s;upremacy, or having violated any of the articles of the &s;tatute of blood.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the before-mentioned letter, dated the la&s;t of
<PB N="28" REF="29">June, Cromwell wrote another to Henry in &s;uch a pathetic &s;train,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death of Cromwell and Lord Hungerford.</NOTE> that his Maje&s;ty &s;eemed affected with it, and cau&s;ed it to be read thrice over in his hearing: but the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions were effaced by the in&s;inuations of the Duke of Norfolk and Bi&s;hop Gardiner; and a warrant was granted for beheading Thomas Cromwell, late Earl of E&s;&s;ex, on Tower-hill, on July 28. When he was brought to the &s;caffold, his regard for his &s;on prevented him from expatiating upon his own inno|cence. He thanked God for bringing him to that death for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: he acknowledged his of|fences again&s;t God and his Prince, and confe&s;&s;ed that he had been &s;educed, but that now he died in the Ca|tholic faith. Then he de&s;ired the bye-&s;tanders to pray for the King, the Prince, and for him&s;elf; and having &s;pent &s;ome time in private devotion, &s;ubmitted his neck to the executioner, who mangled him in a &s;hocking manner. Walter Lord Hungerford &s;uffered at the &s;ame time, for &s;orcery, trea&s;on, and bea&s;tiality.</P>
<P>Henry was very rigid in cau&s;ing the bloody &s;tatute, or the act of the &s;ix articles, to be put in execution; and Papi&s;ts and the Reformed equally felt the fury of his di&s;plea&s;ure, as head of the church. Among the per&s;ons attainted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, there were three for denying his Maje&s;ty's &s;upremacy, and as many for profe&s;&s;ing the doctrines of Prote&s;tanti&s;m. The fir&s;t were Edward Powel, Thomas Abel, and Richard Feather&s;tone; and the latter, Robert Barnes, Doctor of Divinity, with William Jerome, and Thomas Gerard, Bachelors of Divinity. The&s;e were drawn, one of each &s;ort tied together, on hurdles to Smith|field; where the Papi&s;ts were hanged, and the Pro|te&s;tants burned. In the preceding year, a man and a woman, Anabapti&s;ts, were committed to the flames in the &s;ame place; and four per&s;ons of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, three men and a woman, all Dutch, as well as the other two, bore faggots at St. Paul's cro&s;s, to te&s;tify
<PB N="29" REF="30">their recantation and abhorrence of their former tenets.</P>
<P>The year 1540 is al&s;o memorable for a bull granted by Pope Paul III. confirming the order of the Je&s;uits, lately founded by Ignatius Loyola.</P>
<P>A. D. 1541.] The King of England was, in the mean time, intent upon the reformation he propo&s;ed in religion: and the &s;um of it having been drawn up in <HI>The nece&s;&s;ary erudition of a Chri&s;tian Man,</HI> this book was publi&s;hed by authority, and recommended to all per&s;ons, as a rule for directing their belief and practice. It contained an account of the Chri&s;tian covenant, with an expo&s;ition of the Apo&s;tles creed, the Lord's prayer, the Ave-Maria, the ten command|ments, and the &s;acraments: and, though the number of the&s;e la&s;t, and the doctrines relating to them, were a&s;&s;erted therein, agreeable to what had been determined in the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, yet the wor&s;hip of &s;aints, pilgrimages, and other ceremonies, were con|demned. The King's &s;upremacy in eccle&s;ia&s;tical mat|ters was explained &s;o as to prevent offence being taken at his title of <HI>head;</HI> the Pope's preten&s;ions were refuted; the holy Catholic church was defined to be an aggre|gate body, "comprehending all a&s;&s;emblies of men over the whole world, that received the faith of Chri&s;t; who ought to hold an unity of love and brotherly a|greement together, by which they become members of the Catholic church;" and the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of placing its unity in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Bi&s;hop of Rome, is fully &s;hewed. Sinners were taught to depend wholly on the merits of Chri&s;t; unlearned people were exhort|ed to pray in their mother-tongue; and a foundation laid for a further reformation, by declaring, "every national church to be a compleat body within it&s;elf, with power to reform here&s;ies, correct abu&s;es, and do every thing el&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for keeping it&s;elf pure, and governing its members." To complete his de&s;igns for the in&s;truction of his &s;ubjects, he cau&s;ed a new im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="30" REF="31">of the Engli&s;h Bible to be made: and in May this year, i&s;&s;ued &s;trict injunctions, enforced with pe|nalties, that every pari&s;h, throughout the realm, &s;hould purcha&s;e one, to be kept in the church, before All-hallow ride.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty had before erected We&s;tmin&s;ter into an ep$$$pal &s;ee, and a&s;&s;igned all the county of Middle-&s;ex, except the pari&s;h of Fulham, for its dioce&s;e: and he now founded the bi&s;hoprics of Che&s;ter, Glouce&s;ter, and Peterborough; to which were added, in the next year, tho&s;e of Bri&s;tol and Oxford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Thirlby was the fir&s;t and only Bi&s;hop of We&s;tmin&s;ter: the &s;ee of Che&s;ter was filled by John Bird, tran&s;lated from Bangor: John Wakeman, the la&s;t Abbot of Tew&s;ke&s;bury, was con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter: John Chambers, who had been Abbot, was promoted to the &s;ee, of Peterborough: Paul Bu&s;h was made Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol; and Robert King, la&s;t Abbot of Ofney, got the cathedral chair of Oxford.</NOTE>. The priories too of cathedrals were converted into deaneries, and col|leges of prebendaries; the lands of di&s;&s;olved mona&s;te|ries being a&s;&s;igned for the&s;e endo$$$$</P>
<P>This application of a &s;mall part of a$$ey lands, to proper u&s;es, did not prevent an in&s;urrection in the north; where the Romi&s;h ceremonies had taken the deepe&s;t root, and the ejected religious had the greate&s;t influence. It began in April, but was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; Sir John Nevil, and about ten more, who put them|&s;elves at the head of the country people, being taken and put to death at York; and three others executed at London. This incon&s;iderable rebellion was gene|rally imputed to Cardinal Pole's intrigues: and either for this offence of her &s;on, or for &s;ome fre&s;h provoca|tion of her own, the old Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, who had been kept in pri&s;on two years after her conviction and attainder, was beheaded, on May 27, in the Tower of London. The Lord Leonard Grey, bro|ther to the Marquis of Dor&s;et, was, in the next month, indicted for &s;ome trea&s;onable practices with the Iri&s;h,
<PB N="31" REF="32">whil&s;t he was Deputy of Ireland, and for engaging to join Reginald Pole: he pleaded guilty, and was al&s;o beheaded.</P>
<P>A more lamentable fate attended Thomas Fiennes, Lord Dacres; who being drawn in, by &s;ome di&s;orderly per&s;ons, to go and hunt by night in the park of Laugh|ton in Su&s;&s;ex, belonging to Sir Nicholas Pelham, was, in the way thither, engaged in an accidental fray, and one of the adver&s;e party being mortally wounded, and dying about a month after, this young nobleman was tried by his peers for that offence. It was in the eye of the law no more than man&s;laughter; but he, confe&s;&s;ing the fact, without con&s;idering the indictment had been laid for murder, was found guilty, and condemned to be hanged at Tyburn; the &s;entence being accordingly executed upon him, as well as on three gentlemen his accomplices.</P>
<P>The journey which the King made, in Augu&s;t, to York&s;hire, was not &s;o much to extingui&s;h the remains of the late rebellion, as to de&s;troy all monuments of &s;uper&s;tition, pretended miracles, and pilgrimages. Upon his arrival at York, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, encouraging every body who had been injured by any of his officers, to bring their complaints before him and his council, and a&s;&s;uring them of redre&s;s: but this was not the &s;ole end of his progre&s;s. He had, in the beginning of the la&s;t year, &s;ent Ralph Sadler to Edin|burgh, with in&s;tructions to pre&s;s James V. to remove Cardinal Beton from his councils, to &s;eize the lands of mona&s;teries into his own hands, to enter into a &s;tricter amity with him, and to agree upon an inter|view between them, for the &s;ettling of this amity more effectually. James excu&s;ed him&s;elf as to the two fir&s;t particulars, having no objection to the Cardinal's con|duct, nor any temptation to &s;eize the revenues of the religious, who were always ready to &s;upply him with money for his occa&s;ions; but profe&s;&s;ed a firm re&s;olu|tion to live always in friend&s;hip with his uncle, and
<PB N="32" REF="33">con&s;ented to an interview. This was now to be held at York, and Henry had cau&s;ed great preparations to be made there for his nephew's reception: but the Cardinal, and the Scotch prelates, took care to pre|vent a meeting, which they imagined would prove fa|tal to the clergy of Scotland. They were apprehen|&s;ive, that Henry might, in a per&s;onal conference, pre|vail on his nephew to take the &s;teps which had been refu&s;ed on the motion of his amba&s;&s;adors; and made u&s;e not only of all the credit they had with their ma|&s;ter, as being his mini&s;ters, and employed in all the affairs of his realm, but of large promi&s;es to divert him from keeping his engagement with Henry. James, tempted by the a&s;&s;urance of 30,000 crowns a-year be|ing paid him duly by the clergy, who were ready in any difficulty to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all their fortunes, and by the pro&s;pect of more than 100,000 crowns a-year, which they undertook to rai&s;e for him by the forfei|tures of heretics, did not come to the interview; which was con&s;idered as a plain declaration of his ho&s;tile mind, and that he intended to keep no mea&s;ures with his uncle. Henry, di&s;appointed, deluded, and full of re|&s;entment, quitted York at the latter end of September; and, continuing his progre&s;s through &s;everal counties, returned to London, where he was informed of matters that gave him &s;till greater unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King was in his progre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Catherine Howard accu&s;ed of incontinence.</NOTE> one John La&s;&s;els had given the Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury an account, that a &s;i&s;ter of his, who had been a &s;ervant to Agnes Duche&s;s-dowager of Norfolk, under whom Catherine Howard had been brought up, had a&s;&s;ured him, that this Lady, now Queen, was very lewd; that Francis Derham, a &s;ervant in the family, had lain in bed with her, in his doublet and ho&s;e, between the &s;heets, an hundred nights; three female &s;ervants be|ing, at different times, in bed with her, whil&s;t they indulged them&s;elves in &s;uch dalliances; and that one
<PB N="33" REF="34">Mannock (&s;ome time al&s;o in the &s;ervice of the Duche&s;s) had been admitted to the like familiarities, and knew a private mark in her body. The Archbi&s;hop con|&s;ulting the Lord Chancellor and the Earl of Hertford, who had been left by the King to manage affairs in London during his ab&s;ence, they both agreed that he &s;hould acquaint his Maje&s;ty with it: and the matter being of &s;uch a nature, that he could not well expre&s;s it by word of mouth, he drew up the information in writing, and, on November 2, pre&s;ented it to the King. Henry, who had pretended to a wonderful &s;agacity in the ca&s;e of Anne of Cleves, had expre&s;&s;ed no &s;u&s;picion of want of virginity in Catherine Howard, and was &s;till &s;o much in love with her, that, having the day before received ma&s;s, he had then given thanks to God for the good life he had led, and hoped to lead, with her; and de&s;ired his confe&s;&s;or, John Long|land, Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, to join with him in the &s;ame thank&s;giving. No words can repre&s;ent his &s;urprize and vexation, when he received the Archbi&s;hop's nar|rative of the Queen's mi&s;conduct: he imagined it at fir&s;t to be a forged &s;tory, yet re&s;olved to make a &s;trict enquiry into it, but with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecre&s;y. Com|municating the ca&s;e to &s;ome of his coun&s;ellors, he told them, that he believed it to be a piece of calumny: but as he could not re&s;t till he knew the certainty of the affair, he would have it examined with &s;uch pre|cautions, as might pre&s;erve his con&s;ort from &s;candal if &s;he was innocent. He ordered the Keeper of the privy &s;eal to interrogate La&s;&s;els and his &s;i&s;ter; who both re&s;olutely adhered to what they had &s;aid: and Sir Thomas Wriothe&s;ly was appointed to examine Man|nock, and to apprehend Derham, upon pretence of a piracy, with which he had been formerly charged in Ireland. George Mannock owned only &s;ome inde|cent freedoms he had taken in feeling the mo&s;t private parts of her body, prior to the time of Derham's fa|miliarity with her: but this la&s;t confe&s;&s;ed his having
<PB N="34" REF="35">lain frequently with her, and named three different women that were, one after another, in bed with her, when he committed the facts.</P>
<P>It was with an inconceivable grief, and &s;uch a terri|ble di&s;traction of mind, as, barring all utterance of &s;peech, forced a vent only in tears, that Henry re|ceived the report of the examinations. Archbi&s;hop Cranmer the Chancellor, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Su&s;&s;ex, and the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, being appointed to interrogate the Queen on the &s;ubject, &s;he at fir&s;t denied all: but finding them appri&s;ed of all her practices, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the whole to the Arch|bi&s;hop, and &s;igned the confe&s;&s;ion with her own hand. Eight or nine other witne&s;&s;es, who had opportunities of knowing her behaviour, agreed in the &s;ame tale, with other circum&s;tances &s;hewing Catherine's la&s;civiou&s;|ne&s;s and incontinence. There were &s;trong pre&s;umptions that &s;he intended to continue her amours with Derham; having lately taken him into her &s;ervice, and trained him often into her privy-chamber, under pretence of &s;end|ing him on errands, and writing letters, in the ab&s;ence of her &s;ecretary. One of the women, who had been privy to their former familiarities, was likewi&s;e brought to &s;erve in the Queen's bed-chamber. Thomas Cole|pepper, a relation of the Queen by her mother, was taken up on violent &s;u&s;picion, having, whil&s;t the King was in the North, been brought, by the means of Lady Rochford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 431 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>, into her Maje&s;ty's chamber at eleven o'clock at night, and &s;taid there till four in the morn|ing. Upon examination Lady Rochford confe&s;&s;ed the crime: and Colepepper and Derham were hanged; but Mannock got off by giving up the be&s;t part of his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>A. D. 1542.] Further proceedings again&s;t the Queen were referred to a parliament;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Is beheaded.</NOTE> which being &s;ummoned on November 23, met on Ja|nuary 16 at We&s;tmin&s;ter, a bill for attainting Cathe|rine
<PB N="35" REF="36">Howard, late Queen of England, and Jane Lady Rochford, of high trea&s;on, were brought into the Hou$e of Lords on January 21; but the Chancellor mov$ng on the 28th, that they would not proceed too ha&s;tily in a matter of &s;uch importance, in which no room &s;hould be left for &s;u&s;picion, or future complaint, and purga|tion; and that it was proper for a committee of both hou&s;es to wait upon the Queen, and hear what &s;he could alledge in her own behalf, a deputation of that hou&s;e was immediately &s;ent to her. She repeated her confe&s;&s;ion to them: and proce&s;&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e already convicted being brought as a further evidence, the bill pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Lords, on February 8, and being agreed to by the Commons, was pa&s;&s;ed by letters-pa|tent under the great &s;eal; the parliament having de|&s;ired the King not to take the trouble of giving the royal a&s;&s;ent to the act in his own per&s;on.</P>
<P>The old Duche&s;s of Norfolk, Catherine Counte&s;s of Bridgewater (the Queen's aunt) who had been only indic|ted, the Lord William Howard (her uncle) and his wife Margaret, with nine others, who had been convicted at common law for knowing and concealing Catherine's lewdne&s;s, were put into the act, and attainted of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. A clau&s;e in it obliged all per&s;ons, "that &s;hould know anything of the incontinence of the Queen for the time being, to reveal it with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to the King's council, under the pains of trea&s;on: and if the King, or his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hould intend to marry any woman, taking her to be a pure maid, if &s;he, not being &s;o, did not declare it to the King, it &s;hould be deemed high trea&s;on, and all who knew it, and did not reveal it, were made guilty of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on." All &s;olicitations, by me&s;&s;age or words, to engage any one "to corrupt the Queen, or the Prince's wife, were declared high trea&s;on in all parties concerned therein."</P>
<P>The Queen was, upon February 12, beheaded within the Tower; and, confe&s;&s;ing at her death the loo&s;ene&s;s of her former life, prote&s;ted &s;olemnly, that &s;he had
<PB N="36" REF="37">not defiled his Maje&s;ty's couch &s;ince their marriage. The Lady Rochford al&s;o &s;uffered decapitation at the fame time; and as &s;he was a woman of di&s;&s;olute mo|rals, people began to &s;u&s;pect the ju&s;tice of Anne Bo|leyn's fate. It was thought hard to puni&s;h the Queen's relations in &s;o &s;evere a manner, for not di&s;covering her former ill conduct: and the King, in a little time, pardoned them all, as well as mo&s;t of the other con|cealers of Catherine's incontinence.</P>
<P>In this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the bi&s;hoprics of Che&s;ter and of Man were &s;evered from the province of Canterbury, and made &s;ubject to the Archbi&s;hop of York, for in|crea&s;ing the number of his &s;uffragans. On January 23, during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the King a&s;&s;umed the title of <HI>King of Ireland,</HI> his predece&s;&s;ors having only u&s;ed that of <HI>Lord.</HI> This &s;eems to have been no impolitic &s;tep; for whether the Iri&s;h Chri&s;tians had been much weakened before, or thought it not below them to yield obedience, and own a &s;ubordination, to the royal dignity, James Earl of De&s;mond, coming over in the &s;ummer to England, made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: and his example was followed by the heads of &s;everal &s;epts, who were content to take titles of honour after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>James V. had endeavoured to excu&s;e his not com|ing to the interview propo&s;ed at York: but his apo|logies, &s;uch as they were, did not abate Henry's re|&s;entment. Treaties were carried on for an accommo|dation: but the&s;e proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, the King of England publi&s;hed a declaration of war, revived the old claim of &s;uperiority over the crown of Scotland, and required James to do him homage. Some ho&s;ti|lities en&s;ued on both &s;ides: the bad &s;ucce&s;s of an army, &s;ent to ravage the we&s;t marches of England, at Sol|way-ma&s;s, is thought to have contributed to the death of James, who had been for &s;ometime but in an indif|ferent &s;tate of health. He died in his palace on

<P>Henry,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry's views to unite Scot|land with England.</NOTE> on the news of his nephew's death, &s;end$ng, on December 26, for the Earls of Ca&s;&s;els and Glencarne, the Lords Maxwell, Sommervilles, Oliphant, Grey, and &s;everal other Scotch gentlemen, who had been taken at Solway-ma&s;s, and then re&s;ided at Lon|don, to court, acquainted them with his inclination, to prevent all future quarrels between the two nations, and to unite the crowns by marriage between his &s;on Prince Edward, and Mary their infant Sovereign. The pri&s;oners &s;eemed all to like a propo&s;al, that promi|&s;ed &s;o much good to both countries: and &s;ome of them entered very cordially into his mea&s;ures; promi&s;ing upon oath, as well to make up the match, as to bring the young Queen immediately into England, and get the government of the realm, with &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t forts, committed to his Maje&s;ty. They were hereupon relea&s;ed, though under an obligation of returning again to pri&s;on, if they did not accompli&s;h their engagements by a certain day.</P>
<P>A. D. 1543.] Henry had this marriage &s;o much at heart, that, knowing there was a &s;trong party again&s;t it in Scotland, which might create in&s;upportable diffi|culties, when the articles of it came to be adju&s;ted, he re&s;olved to be provided for carrying his point by force, in ca&s;e he did not &s;ucceed by the way of treaty. With this view, when the parliament of England, which had been prorogued from Nov. 3, to January 22, met on the la&s;t of the&s;e days, he repre&s;ented to the two hou&s;es, his claim on the crown of Scotland, the late ho&s;tilities of the Scots, the expences he had been at in the war, the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, the favourable opportunity offered of reducing that country to the obe|dience of England, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply. The Commons, ever liberal of the &s;ubjects money after a
<PB N="38" REF="39">victory, readily granted him a large &s;ub&s;idy to be paid for three years together: and one of &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound was likewi&s;e granted, by the convocation of both provinces. The King was now in the eve of a war, if not with Scotland, at lea&s;t with France, in con&s;equence of a league actually negotiating with the Emperor for that purpo&s;e: and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to provide for the quiet of his &s;ubjects, "by relaxing &s;omewhat of the &s;everity of the &s;tatute of the &s;ix ar|ticles, exempting the laity from death, and making that which was capital for the clergy in the fir&s;t, to be &s;o only in the third offence." This was done by an act for the advancement of true religion, and aboli&s;hing of the contrary; which, "forbidding all per&s;ons to preach without licence, and interdicting all di&s;putes, and the u&s;e of Tindal's Bible, allowed all of a degree not lower than a yeoman, to have the &s;criptures truly tran&s;lated, and every body to read the King's injunc|tions, <HI>The erudition of a Chri&s;tian man,</HI> the p&s;alter, pri|mer, and other books, publi&s;hed by his authority for the in&s;truction of his people." For the better exe|cution of a late &s;tatute, making the King's procla|mation equally obligatory with acts of parliament, offences again&s;t it were &s;ubjected to the cogni&s;ance of nine of the privy council; the greater number, re|quired before, having cau&s;ed great delays in bringing offenders to a trial.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The King marries Ca|therine Parr.</NOTE> The act for attainting Catherine Howard had created a difficulty with regard to the King's marriage; no maiden cared to run the hazard of her life, by expo&s;ing her virginity to be tried by his &s;u&s;picions. He was thus under a nece&s;&s;ity of matching with a widow: and Catherine Parr, re|lict of John Nevil Lord Latimer, being a Lady highly e&s;teemed for her prudence, virtue, and merit, he married her, and cau&s;ed her to be proclaimed Queen, on July 12.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="40">
<P>She favoured the reformation in her heart:<NOTE PLACE="inter">Scheme again&s;t Cranmer.</NOTE> but &s;he knew how dangerous it was to con|tradict the King in religious matters; and therefore &s;he would not venture to interpo&s;e in behalf of three Prote&s;tants, who, &s;oon after her nuptials, were, at the &s;olicitation of Gardiner Bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, burned at Wind&s;or. That prelate, and the other enemies of the reformation, not contented with the de&s;truction of tho&s;e and &s;ome others, eagerly a&s;|pired at the ruin of Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, whom they con&s;idered as the head and protector of all the inno|vators in religion; and on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the King would bear no contradiction in articles of faith, they ventured to in&s;inuate to his Maje&s;ty, that here&s;y would never be wedded out of the land, while its pa|tron was &s;uffered to flouri&s;h. Henry at fir&s;t made no an&s;wer to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, becau&s;e he gue&s;&s;ed their aim, and imagined his &s;ilence would di&s;courage them from renewing their attempts: but Gardiner, and the Duke of Norfolk, with other partizans of popery, re|peated the &s;ame &s;train &s;o often, that his curio&s;ity was intere&s;ted. He &s;eemed to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to their remon&s;trances, and even received &s;ome articles of ac|cu&s;ation again&s;t the primate, &s;ub&s;cribed with the names of his accu&s;ers; for the Duke and the Bi&s;hop, being unwilling to appear as parties in the affair, had pre|vailed upon the canons of Canterbury, and &s;ome ju&s;|tices of the peace in Kent, to prefer tho&s;e articles again&s;t Cranmer. Henry, thus informed, took an opportunity, while he diverted him&s;elf on the Thames, to &s;top at Lambeth; and the Archbi&s;hop coming down to receive his Maje&s;ty, was ordered to come into the barge, where the King conver&s;ed with him in private. He expre&s;&s;ed his unea&s;ine&s;s at the growth of here&s;y, which he &s;aid he was re&s;olved to extirpate, by pu|ni&s;hing its favourers and protectors with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law. Cranmer applauded his re&s;olution; but intreated him, in the name of God, to examine
<PB N="40" REF="41">well what was branded with the name of here&s;y, le&s;t, in puni&s;hing &s;uppo&s;ed heretics, he &s;hould wreak his vengeance on the faithful &s;ervants of the Almighty. Then the King told him, that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the chief protector of the heretics, and put into his hands the articles of accu&s;ation; which the Archbi&s;hop having peru&s;ed with great compo&s;ure, he fell upon his knees, and de&s;ired he might be brought to trial. He frankly owned, that, with re&s;pect to the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, which he had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, his &s;entiments &s;till remained unaltered, though he had never &s;poke nor acted again&s;t it in any &s;hape, &s;ince it acquired the force of a law. When the King a&s;ked him, if he was really married? he an&s;wered in the affirmative: but de|clared, that, as &s;oon as the act of the &s;ix articles had pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, he &s;ent his wife to Germany. Henry was &s;o &s;truck with the candour and ingenuity of the Primate, that he a&s;&s;ured him of his protection; made him acquainted with the &s;cheme that was formed for his de&s;truction; di&s;clo&s;ed to him the names of his accu&s;ers; and commanded him to pro&s;ecute them for defamation. Cranmer begged to be excu&s;ed; but the King in&s;i&s;ted upon his proceeding, and de&s;ired him to nominate the judges. The Archbi&s;hop, however, pro|ceeded &s;o coldly in the pro&s;ecution, that Henry, &s;eeing it was again&s;t his inclination, allowed him to drop it, though he could not help admiring his genero&s;ity. Such was the &s;implicity of Cranmer's heart, that he could not di&s;tingui&s;h his own enemies; and &s;uch his benevolence, that he could not with-hold his a&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e whom he knew to be his adver&s;aries. One day he went to court to &s;olicit in favour of a per&s;on who had craved his intere&s;t. Henry a&s;ked him, if he thought that per&s;on was his friend? and he replying in the affirmative, "No (&s;aid the King) he is your inve|terate foe, and I order you to call him knave when you &s;ee him." Cranmer begged he might be excu&s;ed from u&s;ing &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, as they did not become the mouth
<PB N="41" REF="42">of a Bi&s;hop. Henry &s;aid he would be obeyed; but Cranmer found means to avoid the meeting; and the King continued to admire and love him for his meek|ne&s;s and benevolence.</P>
<P>A war having broke out la&s;t year between the Em|peror and France, the former endeavoured by all means to enter into a league with England: and the articles being &s;ettled on February 11, it was ratified in le&s;s than three months after; and Sir John Wallop was, on July 7, &s;ent over, with Sir Thomas Seymour, and 6000 men, to join the Imperial army in Flanders.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the parliament of Scotland meet|ing on March 12, declared next day the Earl of Ar|ran the &s;econd per&s;on in the realm, and next in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the crown, in ca&s;e of the Queen's decea&s;e with|out i&s;&s;ue. In&s;tructions were likewi&s;e given to Sir James Lermont, Sir W. Hamilton, and H. Balneves, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, appointed amba&s;&s;adors, for treating a peace with England, and the marriage of the Queen with Prince Edward. The&s;e re&s;trained them from con&s;enting, either to her removal into England before &s;he was of age to be married, or to the &s;urrender of any forts for &s;ecurity of her being delivered afterwards. There was however a &s;trong party determined to op|po&s;e the marriage; the Queen-mother, the Cardinal, all the clergy, and the French faction among the no|bility, being embarked in it. Such was the &s;ituation of affairs when Sir Ralph Sadler arrived at Edinburgh, the day after the rece&s;s of parliament.</P>
<P>However, the oppo&s;ition that was made did not pre|vent the treaties being concluded, on July 1, at Green|wich. That of peace was made for the lives of both Princes, and for a year after the decea&s;e of either. That for the marriage provided, that the Queen &s;hould, at the con&s;ummation of the marriage, have a jointure of 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year &s;ettled on her during Henry's life, to be increa&s;ed to 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> after his decea&s;e; that when &s;he was ten years of age complete, the contract of
<PB N="42" REF="43">marriage being made by the proxies of the parties, &s;he &s;hould be &s;ent into England; that ho&s;tages &s;hould be delivered to Henry's commi&s;&s;ioners, for the per|formance of the articles relating to the marriage; that the kingdom of Scotland &s;hould &s;till retain its name, laws, and liberties; and if, after the Queen's going to England, Prince Edward &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue by her, &s;he &s;hould have free liberty of returning to Scotland unmarried, and without any impediment. A convention of the e&s;tates was called at Edinburgh, and, on Augu&s;t 25, the Governor &s;wore, in their name, to the ob&s;ervance thereof. Cardinal Beton, and the re&s;t of the French party, &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ent to it; but it was only to cover their de&s;igns: for, in the month of October, having received &s;uccours from France, they openly &s;hewed their intentions to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Cardinal &s;oon per&s;uaded the Governor, James Hamilton Earl of Arran, who was of a fickle di&s;po&s;i|tion, to change &s;ides, upon the French amba&s;&s;ador's a&s;&s;urances of their being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by 6000 men in his ma&s;ter's pay, from Denmark, with money to main|tain 10,000 Scotch in the field, and with all the force by &s;ea and land that they &s;hould de&s;ire. The late trea|ties of peace and marriage with England were annulled, as being expired, and not to be kept on the part of Scotland, on prerence of their being broke by the de|taining of Scotch &s;hips, and their not being ratified by Henry. New alliances were made with France for the inva&s;ion of England, whenever the French realm &s;hould be attacked by Henry.</P>
<P>1544.] The&s;e proceedings put the two nations into the &s;ame &s;tate of war they were in before the treaties: and Henry dete&s;ting the Governor's fal&s;ehood, knowing the engagements which the Cardinal, and the prevailing party in the kingdom, had entered into with France, to be utterly incompatible with &s;uch terms of peace as were nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of his realm, and &s;ee|ing
<PB N="43" REF="44">that the gentle ways of treaty, which, like a polite courtier, he had at fir&s;t taken to procure the marriage, and e&s;tabli&s;h a perpetual amity, had not &s;ucceeded, he re&s;olved to proceed in a different manner, and make them feel the effects of his vengeance.</P>
<P>To provide for a Scotch as well as French war, the King obtained from the parliament, which met on January 14, a di&s;charge of all the &s;ums he had bor|rowed two years before upon loan from individuals. As he propo&s;ed to go abroad in per&s;on, at the head of his army, it was proper to &s;ettle the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the crown &s;o,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ettled anew.</NOTE> as not to leave it doubtful in ca&s;e of any accident: and this was done in &s;uch a manner, as to gratify the Em|peror, with whom he was now in league, and who in|tere&s;ted him&s;elf much for the Prince&s;s Mary. An act pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ettling it on Prince Edward, and the Prin|ce&s;s Mary and Elizabeth, and their i&s;&s;ue, in their re|&s;pective orders, according to the u&s;ual cour&s;e of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; the two la&s;t being &s;ubjected to &s;uch condi|tions as the King, by letters-patent, or his la&s;t will, &s;igned by his hand, &s;hould appoint. Several per&s;ons had been burnt the la&s;t year for here&s;y; and the King, &s;eeming to relent a little, put a &s;top, for a while, to &s;uch per&s;ecutions, as he imagined they would throw a blot upon his reign<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Among the&s;e was Adam Darnlip, who, having been laid hold of before, made his e&s;cape to the We&s;t of England, where he taught a &s;chool. When he was retaken, he was by Bi&s;hop Gardiner com|mitted to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, and afterwards carried to execution. One Henry was burned at Colche&s;ter; and another per&s;on called Kirby &s;uffered at Ip&s;wich.</NOTE>: and it was moreover thought proper to prevent their being revived, le&s;t any di&s;tur|bance &s;hould happen in the realm during his ab&s;ence. Thus an act pa&s;&s;ed to qualify that of the &s;ix articles, by providing, "that none &s;hould be indicted for any offence again&s;t it, but upon a pre&s;entment by the oaths of twelve per&s;ons, nor impri&s;oned till &s;o indicted; that
<PB N="44" REF="45">all pre&s;entments &s;hould be made within a year after the offences committed; that no preacher &s;hould be pro&s;e|cuted for words, unle&s;s complained of within forty days after his &s;ermon, and the parties indicted were allowed the challenges u&s;ual in any other ca&s;e of fe|lony." The&s;e clau&s;es were added, to di&s;courage and prevent &s;uch accu&s;ations as had been lately brought again&s;t Cranmer, and others, by the artifices of Gar|diner, who had a &s;lur thrown upon him by the execu|tion of German Gardiner his &s;ecretary, on March 7, for denying the King's &s;upremacy.</P>
<P>Among other &s;tatutes enacted in this parliament, there was one for empowering the King to nominate commi&s;&s;ioners for revi&s;ing the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titu|tions: and, in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the titles of King of Eng|land, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith, and &s;upreme head of the Anglicane church, were in&s;epa|rably annexed to the Engli&s;h crown.</P>
<P>Henry's eagerne&s;s for his French expedition did not make him forget his care of religion. With a view of reforming the publick offices, he had cau&s;ed a form of proce&s;&s;ion, a litany, collects, p&s;alms, and a paraphra&s;e on the Lord's prayer, all in the Engli&s;h tongue, to be publi&s;hed, with a preface, exhorting all per&s;ons to pray in their mother language. This compo&s;ition had no|thing exceptionable in it, except &s;ome invocations to &s;aints to pray for the congregation, which did not re|concile it to the Roman Catholics &s;o far as to prevent their being &s;hocked at a new petition in&s;erted therein, for delivery "from the tyranny of the Bi&s;hop of Rome, and all his dete&s;table enormities."</P>
<P>The King, leaving the Queen Regent, &s;ailed on July 11 for Calais; his forces having landed there &s;ome time before, and part of them, under the D$$$$ of Norfolk, having marched to Mon&s;treuil. The$ $word$ $$e of Suffolk having inve&s;ted Boulogne on July 19, the lower town was taken two days after. The King ar|riving on the 26th in the camp with the re&s;t of his
<PB N="45" REF="46">forces, which now amounted to 30,000 men, a battery was erected, on Augu&s;t 3, again&s;t the higher town: but, for want of powder, the &s;iege went on &s;o &s;lowly, that the place did not &s;urrender till the 14th of Sep|tember. The Emperor's concluding a treaty of peace with France, about this time, &s;aved Mon&s;treuil; for the Dauphin advancing with a great army, and the Imperial Generals retiring with their forces, the Duke of Norfolk rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and joined the main army at Boulogne: where Henry having &s;pent &s;ome time in treating about a peace, without any effect, &s;ailed thence, on September 30, for England.</P>
<P>A. D. 1545.] Having been at a great expence in his French expedition, and the keeping of Boulogne being likely to co&s;t him a great deal more, to provide for it, Henry had recour&s;e to the extraordinary way of benevo|lence, which he found &s;ome difficulty in levying<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a general clamour again&s;t this method of rai&s;ing money, and one Read, an Alderman of London, being very refrac|tory, was impre&s;&s;ed to &s;erve as a &s;oldier on the northern marches.</NOTE>. The &s;ucce&s;s which the Engli&s;h had lately met with in their incur&s;ions into Scotland, encouraged them to make another in February; but being defeated on the 17th of this month, by the Earl of Angus, were forced to retreat. The Scots a&s;&s;embled an army of 15,000 men, to invade England; but contented them&s;elves with ad|vancing to the borders, and then retired, without ef|fecting their purpo&s;e. At the &s;ame time the French made &s;everal de&s;cents and attempts on the coa&s;t of England, with very little &s;ucce&s;s; for the Engli&s;h &s;leet being reinforced, &s;o as to venture an engagement in the open &s;ea, they returned to Havre.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the King's expences in the&s;e wars, a par|liament was &s;ummoned. It met on November 23, and granted him two whole fifteenths and tenths, be|&s;ides an u&s;ual &s;ub&s;idy, to be paid for two years toge|ther; another of &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound, payable in
<PB N="46" REF="47">two years, being granted at the &s;ame time by the clergy.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Colleges, ho&s;|pitals, &amp;c. &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> It was &s;till a larger &s;upply, which he got by the parliament's giving him the di&s;po&s;al of all chapels, colleges, chantries, ho&s;pitals, and fraternities, with their lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions throughout the kingdom. Twenty-four of the&s;e had already &s;urrendered to the King; the lands of others had either been &s;eized by the founders, or lea&s;ed out for long terms: but all being now ve&s;ted in the crown, the &s;eizures and lea&s;es were annulled, and the re&s;ignations confirmed. Hence followed a general de&s;truction of tho&s;e foundations, mo&s;t of which had been in&s;tituted to &s;ay ma&s;&s;es in for the &s;ouls of their benefactors: but the King took care to confirm the rights of the univer&s;ities. Any two churches lying within a mile of one another, and either of them not exceeding 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in the King's book, were allowed to be united, and incorporated together by the ordinary, with the con&s;ent of the patron, incumbent, and pa|ri&s;hioners: and doctors of the civil law, though lay|men and married, were allowed to exerci&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>A. D. 1546.] A peace having been concluded with France at Campes between Ardres and Gui&s;nes, it was proclaimed at London on June 13, though it was not ratified by the King of France till the 1&s;t of Au|gu&s;t. It was agreed, that the Scotch &s;hould be com|prehended in this treaty, &s;o as the King of England &s;hould make no war upon them, unle&s;s &s;ome new oc|ca&s;ion were given.</P>
<P>One of the King's motives for the late war with France, was his re&s;entment at Francis's having broke his promi&s;e of ca&s;ting off the Pope's &s;upremacy, and promoting a reformation in his dominions: and &s;ome writers relate, that, at the peace of Campes, a &s;ecret engagement was made between them, for aboli&s;hing the ma&s;s in both their realms. It is added, that the King had ordered Cranmer to draw up a communion-office
<PB N="47" REF="48">in place of it, to be &s;ent to Francis, for his con|&s;ideration: but, though Henry might order &s;uch a form to be drawn for the u&s;e of his own realm, the King of France &s;eems to have been, at that time, in no di&s;po|&s;ition for making &s;uch an alteration in the French di|vine offices: at lea&s;t his amba&s;&s;adors, in their harangue, on July 29, to the council of Trent, expre&s;sly di&s;|claimed all de&s;igns of that nature, profe&s;&s;ed his deter|mined adherence to the Pope, and the church of Rome, and repre&s;ented it as a great merit in the King of France, that, though he had often been &s;olicited by large offers to do otherwi&s;e, and follow Henry's ex|ample, yet nothing could ever &s;hake him in his re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>That council having been opened on December 13, 1545,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in the council of Trent.</NOTE> held its &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion in the be|ginning of this year, on January 7, when thirty-two Bi&s;hops were pre&s;ent, mo&s;t of them Italians. As the Cardinals de Monte, Cervino, and Pole, the Pope's Legates, who pre&s;ided in it, had not as yet received full in&s;tructions of what they were to treat of, or how they were to proceed, nothing was done in it, be&s;ides fixing the &s;tyle it was to a&s;&s;ume, viz. the holy, oecumenical, and general coun|cil of Trent: the additional words, repre&s;enting the church univer&s;al, propo&s;ed by the French Bi&s;hops, be|ing rejected. Another motion for delivering their opi|nions, or voting by nations, had the &s;ame fate; the number of Italian Bi&s;hops being greater than tho&s;e of France, Spain, and Germany, put together. The next &s;e&s;&s;ion was &s;pent in reading and profe&s;&s;ing their belief of the Nicene creed: but in the fourth, on A|pril 8, they agreed in a decree, that, "the council received, with equal re&s;pect, all the books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, and traditions concerning faith and manners, as derived from the mouth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, dictated by the Holy Spirit, and pre&s;erved in the Catho|lic church." This was followed by a catalogue of the
<PB N="48" REF="49">&s;acred books (among which were the apocryphal, that had never been received by the Jewi&s;h church) and an anathema "again&s;t all who did not either receive the&s;e books entire for &s;acred and canonical, &s;o as they are read in the Catholic church, and contained in the <HI>vulgat</HI> Latin, or did knowingly and deliberately de&s;pi&s;e traditions." This was done, without &s;pecifying the particular traditions thus equalized with the &s;criptures, and without laying down any rules to &s;hew, either what traditions ought to be received on that foot, or why the order of Deacone&s;&s;es, which undoubtedly was of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution, or the cup in the euchari&s;t, in|&s;tituted by our Saviour him&s;elf, and &s;upported by the univer&s;al, uniform, and con&s;tant practice of the church, for 1400 years, were not admitted among &s;uch tradi|tions. No ver&s;ion can, in the nature of things, be of equal authority with the text; yet they declared, "the <HI>vulgat</HI> Latin tran&s;lation of the &s;criptures to be divine and authentic, though they knew it to differ in many places from the original text; and to abound with &s;uch a multitude of errors, that it was a work of many years to correct them, and, after e&s;tabli&s;hing it with all the&s;e errors, they actually agreed to refer the correc|tion of it to &s;ix divines, who were to publi&s;h it before the end of the council. They next "condemned all interpretations of &s;cripture contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the church, and the unanimous con&s;ent of the fathers;" which, as the fathers are &s;eldom unanimous in their explaining of any text, was arrogating the expo&s;ition of &s;cripture to their own church, exclu&s;ive of the re&s;t, and mo&s;t numerous part, of chri&s;tendom. The &s;e&s;&s;ion concluded with "a prohibition of printing, &s;elling, or keeping any anonymous books, not approved by authority," under pain of excommunication; a decree daily broke, and never ob&s;erved in any country, but where the inqui&s;ition is e&s;tabli&s;hed. There were not above five Cardinals, and forty-eight Bi&s;hops, &s;ome
<PB N="49" REF="50">of them only titular, pre&s;ent, when points of &s;uch con&s;equence were determined.</P>
<P>The Lutheran divines had, in a late conference with the Roman Catholics, at Rati&s;bon, explained their &s;entiments with regard to original &s;in, and &s;ome other points, in &s;uch a manner, that both &s;ides had agreed on the &s;ubject: but the members of the council think|ing it below them to agree with the former in any thing, looked out for pretences to multiply di&s;putes. Thus catching hold of &s;ome unguarded expre&s;&s;ions of Luther, which had been explained in a good &s;en&s;e, they condemn|ed them in five canons, about original &s;in, which they pa&s;&s;ed in their fifth &s;e&s;&s;ion, on June 17, without pub|li&s;hing, as u&s;ual, any expo&s;ition of their own doctrine, upon the &s;ubject. The doctrines about ju&s;tification, free-will, grace, and prede&s;tination, took up &s;even months, till January 13, when decrees were made on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, couched in terms too unintelligible for the in&s;truction of the generality of Chri&s;tians, and founded, in &s;everal points, upon &s;chola&s;tic opinions and the philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle; &s;o that, if this Heathen had not furni&s;hed them with the di&s;tinction of final, efficient, meritorious, in&s;trumental, and formal cau&s;es, &s;ome articles of faith would have been wanting. The word <HI>&s;acrament</HI> had been formerly u&s;ed, &s;ometimes in a very loo&s;e &s;en&s;e, and applied to all rites de&s;igned for the honour of God. It was not till the twelfth cen|tury (a very late date for an apo&s;tolical tradition) that Lombard, the father of the &s;choolmen, delivered his opinion, that they were &s;even in number. The coun|cil however, in this next &s;e&s;&s;ion, on March 3 (when their decrees on the &s;acraments in general, and on bapti&s;m and confirmation in particular, were pa&s;&s;ed, unattended by any expo&s;ition of their own doctrine) thought fit, without determining what was the pro|per e&s;&s;ence and true notion of a &s;acrament, to pro|nounce an anathema again&s;t all, "that either held there were more or fewer &s;acraments than &s;even pro|perly
<PB N="50" REF="51">&s;o called, or that &s;aid they were not all in&s;tituted by Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" though there is not, with regard to &s;ome of them, the lea&s;t pretence to &s;uch an immediate in&s;titution, as the words &s;eem to imply. "All who held that none of them were more worthy than another in any re&s;pect, or that they were not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion" (though they were not &s;o to all per&s;ons, becau&s;e, in their notions, there was a high perfection in vows of virginity, and matrimony was incompatible with orders) or "that bapti&s;m, orders, and confirmation did not imprint in the &s;oul an indelible &s;piritual charac|ter" (though &s;uch an indelible quality impre&s;&s;ed on the &s;oul is utterly incomprehen&s;ible) or "that the mi|ni&s;ter's intention (either actual or virtual) to do what the church does, is not nece&s;&s;ary in the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments," were &s;ubjected to the like ana|themas. Eight days after the&s;e decrees, on March 11, the council was, in con&s;equence of a papal bull, transferred to Bologna in Italy; on the report of a plague in Tirol, and the unverified pretence of a con|tagious &s;ickne&s;s at Trent, which either cea&s;ed or was never heard of, after the council was removed.</P>
<P>The proceedings of this council &s;eemed very well to ju&s;tify the objections which the Lutheran Princes and &s;tates had made, to excu&s;e their not owning it as a free council, and their not &s;ubmitting to its decrees. They had de&s;ired a free one to be held &s;omewhere in Ger|many: but it could not be pretended, that Trent was in that country, on any other account, than becau&s;e its Bi&s;hop was a Prince of the empire; nor was it a &s;afe place for them to come to, &s;ince they would be there as much in the Pope's power, as if they had been in Italy. They could not think a council free, if the Pope, who was a party in the ca&s;e, or his Legates, &s;hould pre&s;ide in it, and con&s;equently be ma&s;ters of all debates, propo&s;ing, interrupting, &s;u&s;pending them, and &s;tarting new &s;ubjects at their plea&s;ure. The&s;e were practices which the court of Rome would un|doubtedly
<PB N="51" REF="52">u&s;e, to prevent deci&s;ions di&s;agreeable to its maxims or intere&s;ts; and would &s;ucceed in them the ea&s;ier, becau&s;e all Bi&s;hops were pre-engaged to the Pope, by oaths of obedience they had taken to him, and for the &s;upport of the Papacy. It was for this rea&s;on they in&s;i&s;ted, that, before a council was called, the forms and methods of its proceedings, its con&s;titution and authority, &s;hould be &s;ettled; and that the &s;criptures, with the &s;en&s;e of the primitive fathers and councils in the fir&s;t &s;ix centuries, &s;hould be made the rule of its deci&s;ions, without any regard to the quirks, &s;ubtilties, di&s;tinctions, or opinions of the &s;choolmen. How ju&s;t their apprehen&s;ions were, appeared in all the tran&s;actions of the council, which could not take a &s;tep till leave was granted by the Pope, nor debate any point, but what his Legates thought fit to propo&s;e. The&s;e Pre|lates a&s;&s;umed an authority which de&s;troyed its freedom, putting off debates whenever they plea&s;ed, excluding Vergerio, Bi&s;hop of Capo d'I&s;tria, from his &s;eat there, brow-beating and reprimanding the learned and pious Bi&s;hops of Fie&s;oli and Chioggia (for &s;peaking their minds in behalf of the reformation of &s;ome abu&s;es) in &s;uch a manner, as to oblige them at la&s;t to retire; and telling the Spani&s;h Bi&s;hops, who pre&s;&s;ed for re&s;idence being declared <HI>jure divino,</HI> with an imperious air, "It was the Pope's plea&s;ure they &s;hould &s;peak no more on the &s;ubject that &s;e&s;&s;ion." This prohibition aro&s;e from an apprehen&s;ion, that if it was once determined, that God had enjoined Bi&s;hops to watch ince&s;&s;antly over their flocks, it would be inferred thence, that he had given them all the powers nece&s;&s;ary for the di&s;charge of their duty.</P>
<P>The Emperor was very urgent, that the council would proceed upon matters of reformation, before they meddled with doctrines; the Pope was for beginning with the&s;e la&s;t, and deferring the other perhaps for ever. It was nece&s;&s;ary, for the execution of their &s;chemes in Germany, to make a &s;hew of doing &s;ome|thing
<PB N="52" REF="53">towards a reformation of abu&s;es; and, a com|promi&s;e being made for proceeding on both together, the Pope &s;ent in&s;tructions to his Legates, to proceed with expedition in the doctrines, and with all the &s;low|ne&s;s, they could contrive, in the points of reformation. His orders were executed; pa&s;&s;ages were extracted from the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion, and the works of Luther and Zuinglius, with no other view than to cen|&s;ure them, if they were capable of an ill &s;en&s;e, though they had at the &s;ame time a good one, in which they might have been taken. It was a received principle among the Prelates a&s;&s;embled at Trent, that it was odious and &s;candalous for them to agree with Luther in any thing: hence aro&s;e &s;o many pretences for making real errors of &s;uch as were only nominal, as depending purely on the &s;en&s;e of expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;o many unnece&s;&s;ary deci&s;ions in trifles and verbal di&s;|putes. The Pope had given directions, that, in points conte&s;ted among the Roman Catholics, care &s;hould be taken to avoid deciding particularly to the prejudice of one of the parties, for fear of occa&s;ioning &s;chi&s;ms, or rai&s;ing di&s;putes, which might hinder their acting in concert again&s;t the Lutherans. Hence aro&s;e &s;uch an affected ob&s;curity in &s;ome decrecs, that the learned Pybrac &s;ays, in a letter to the Chancellor de L'Hopital, that whereas other men &s;poke to be under|&s;tood, it &s;eemed to be the de&s;ign of this council to ex|pre&s;s them&s;elves &s;o, as not to be under&s;tood. As mo&s;t of the decrees were founded on &s;chola&s;tic notions, it was impo&s;&s;ible in certain ca&s;es to avoid di&s;putes be|tween the Thomi&s;ts and the Scoti&s;ts; though &s;everal new articles of faith were prevented by the violent at|tachment which the Dominicans and Franci&s;cans had for their contradictory opinions. When, in order to condemn Luther, it was nece&s;&s;ary to touch on any of the&s;e controverted doctrines, the decrees were framed &s;o, as to create a union in words, which each man in|terpreted his own way, whil&s;t their &s;entiments were
<PB N="53" REF="54">as widely different as ever. Hence it came, that in le&s;s than two years Soto and Vega, both eminent divines, who had a great &s;hare in all debates of the council, publi&s;hing comments upon its decrees in the fifth &s;e&s;&s;ion, maintained their oppo&s;ite opinions to be the true &s;en&s;e of the council: and the former of the&s;e having publi&s;hed a book, <HI>De Natura et Gratia,</HI> was oppo&s;ed by Catharin, in the article of certainty of grace; each pretending, that the council had decided in his favour, though their opinions were contradictory. Both parties appealed to the Bi&s;hops who had &s;at in the council; but the&s;e were divided in their &s;entiments, which of them were in the right, nor could even the Pre&s;idents take upon them to determine the true &s;en&s;e of the decree in que&s;tion; which not having been un|der&s;tood by the per&s;ons, that at that time compiled it, can hardly now be &s;uppo&s;ed more intelligible. As to the points of reformation, the council avoided touch|ing on the hundred grievances for which the Germans demanded redre&s;s; and, mo&s;t of the&s;e ari&s;ing from the court of Rome, the Pope would not &s;uffer the council to meddle with them; but i&s;&s;uing a bull, re&s;erved the reformation of his own court and mini&s;ters to him&s;elf. He took the &s;ame method with regard to the union of benefices, whether perpetual or for life only, made within the la&s;t forty years, to pluralities and re&s;idences; and his Legates, following his in&s;tructions, with the Bi&s;hops under their direction, exerted all their arts and influence to prevent a &s;erious and &s;olid reformation; and, when it could be done in no other way, got the matters in debate &s;till referred to the Pope, that nothing might be reformed to the prejudice of the Papal inte|re&s;t and preten&s;ions. Hence aro&s;e tho&s;e clau&s;es, <HI>&s;alva &s;emper in omnibus autoritate apo&s;tolica,</HI> and, "if the a|po&s;tolical &s;ee &s;hall not judge otherwi&s;e;" which may be &s;een in &s;everal of the decrees of reformation. Potent bodies, and rich Cardinals, were concerned in many of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous corruptions; and tho&s;e were
<PB N="54" REF="55">not to be di&s;obliged: nor could any endeavours pre|vail, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing or recalling the exorbitant exemp|tions or privileges of the mendicant orders, though they rendered a Bi&s;hop's re&s;idence in a manner u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;ubverted all order and di&s;cipline. Hence it came, that no reformation was made, but what was either trifling in it&s;elf, or likely to prove u&s;ele&s;s, by being &s;ubject to a papal di&s;pen&s;ation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more of this council in the fir&s;t volume of this work, p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nothing was propo&s;ed (as the Emperor had en|gaged) in this council, relating to the King of Eng|land, who dictated at home in religious and civil mat|ters, and his &s;ubjects dur&s;t not avow any deviation from his &s;entiments. He had for ten years been trou|bled with ulcers in his legs, the pain of which, together with his corpulence and other bodily infirmities, ren|dered him &s;o peevi&s;h and fretful, that &s;carce any per|&s;on approached him without fear and trembling. He was impatient of contradiction in every thing, and e&s;pe|cially in matters of religion; but by this time his tem|per was &s;o irritated, that tho&s;e, who pre&s;umed to dif|fer from him in opinion, could expect no mercy.

<P>A young lady named Anne, daughter of Sir Wil|liam A&s;cough,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Anne A&s;cough burned.</NOTE> of North Kel&s;ey in Lin|coln&s;hire, being a woman of uncom|mon
<PB N="55" REF="56">talents, was well known and e&s;teemed by &s;everal per&s;ons at court. She was convicted of denying the real pre&s;ence in the &s;acrament, and cho&s;e rather to &s;uf|fer death than to purcha&s;e pardon by abjuring her prin|ciples. Being known to be favoured by &s;ome ladies of high rank, and &s;u&s;pected of maintaining a religious corre&s;pondence with the Queen, Sir Thomas Wriothe|&s;ley, Lord Chancellor, hoping that &s;he would di&s;co|ver &s;omething that might furni&s;h matter of impeach|ment again&s;t her Maje&s;ty, the Earl of Hertford, or his Counte&s;s, who favoured the reformation, cau&s;ed Anne to be put to the rack; and he is even &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted manually in augmenting the torture, which, though admini&s;tered with uncommon violence, &s;he en|dured with the mo&s;t amazing fortitude. Her bones were di&s;located in &s;uch a manner, that &s;he was obliged to be carried in a chair to the &s;take in Smithfield, where &s;he (being then about 25 years of age) &s;uffered with Nicholas Belevian, a prie&s;t of Shrop&s;hire, John La&s;&s;els, gentleman of the hou&s;hold to the King, and John Adams, a poor taylor of London, all condemn|ed on the &s;ame account; and Shaxton attended them to the place, where he preached a &s;ermon, reproach|ing them, in the har&s;he&s;t terms, as ob&s;tinate and in|corrigible heretics.</P>
<P>The enemies of the reformation, perceiving the King &s;o furiou&s;ly incen&s;ed again&s;t the Sa|cramentarians,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Another at|tempt again&s;t Cranmer.</NOTE> or tho&s;e who did not be|lieve in tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, made another effort to de&s;troy Cranmer. They renewed their complaints again&s;t him, as the protector of that &s;ect; and told Henry, that were the Archbi&s;hop once committed to the Tower, &s;uch proofs would appear again&s;t him, as would a&s;toni&s;h his Maje&s;ty. The King loved Cranmer with an affection which &s;eemed to contradict every other part of his character; and he now re&s;ented the pre&s;umption of tho&s;e who attempted to ruin a man, in who&s;e favour he had &s;o often inter|po&s;ed.
<PB N="56" REF="57">Neverthele&s;s he di&s;&s;embled his &s;entiments, re|ceived the articles of his accu&s;ation, and permitted that he &s;hould next day be examined in council. In the evening, however, he &s;ent privately for Cranmer, told him what had pa&s;&s;ed, and de&s;ired to know in what man|ner he propo&s;ed to defend him&s;elf. The Archbi&s;hop thanked the King for his great goodne&s;s in making him previou&s;ly acquainted with the de&s;igns of his adver|&s;aries, and humbly intreated his Maje&s;ty to appoint &s;uch judges for his trial, as &s;hould under&s;tand the &s;ub|ject on which he was to be que&s;tioned. Henry, &s;miling at the Primate's &s;implicity, told him he was a fool to make &s;o light of his own &s;afety; that, if he was once in pri&s;on, his enemies would find abundance of fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es to ruin him; and that, &s;ince he would not take care of him&s;elf, he (the King) would look after his affairs. He directed him to appear before the council when &s;ummoned, and plead his privilege as Privy Coun&s;ellor, that his accu&s;ers might be brought before his face; that in ca&s;e they &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon his being &s;ent to the Tower, he &s;hould appeal per&s;onally to the King, and produce his Maje&s;ty's &s;eal-ring, which he then took from his finger, and delivered to Cranmer. Next morning, the Archbi&s;hop was cited to appear before the council, and going to the place where they &s;at, was kept waiting in a lobby among &s;ervants, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all the &s;pectators, until Dr. Butts, the King's phy&s;ician, having &s;een him by accident, communicated this circum&s;tance to Henry, who forth|with &s;ent an order that he &s;hould be admitted. When the Primate appeared before the board, they acquaint|ed him that they had received divers informations, af|firming that all the here&s;ies in England &s;prang from him and his chaplains. Cranmer, in his an&s;wer, conform|ed to the King's direction; and perceiving them bent upon committing him to the Tower, told them he was &s;orry to be &s;o u&s;ed by tho&s;e with whom he had &s;at &s;o long at the &s;ame board. At the &s;ame time he pre|&s;ented
<PB N="57" REF="58">the ring; at the &s;ight of which the coun&s;ellors were a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded, and repaired in a body to the King, who chid them &s;everely for having treat|ed the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury in &s;o unworthy a manner. He told them, he thought he had a wi&s;er council than now he found they were. He laid his hand upon his brea&s;t, and declared, by the faith he owed to God, that he believed the Archbi&s;hop was the mo&s;t faithful of all his &s;ubjects. The Duke of Nor|folk endeavoured to excu&s;e their conduct, by &s;aying, that all they intended was a trial, by which the Arch|bi&s;hop's innocence would have been vindicated &s;o, as to be free from all future a&s;per&s;ion. Henry replied, with a frown, he would not &s;uffer per&s;ons, who were &s;o dear to him, to be handled in that fa&s;hion; and &s;aid that he knew their factions and malice, and that he was re&s;olved to extingui&s;h the one, and puni&s;h the other without mercy. In the mean time he commanded them to be reconciled to the Primate; and the cere|mony was performed in his pre&s;ence.</P>

<PB N="58" REF="59">the Queen, and her principal ladies, as heretics who patronized the innovators, and had corre&s;ponded with Anne A&s;cough. They even affirmed, that they were traitors as well as heretics; and inflamed his Maje&s;ty's pa&s;&s;ion in &s;uch an artful manner, that he &s;ub&s;cribed certain articles again&s;t the Queen, intended as the foundation of an impeachment. The Chancellor hap|pening to drop the paper, it was found by a per&s;on who delivered it to Catherine. She no &s;ooner &s;aw the King's &s;ub&s;cription, than &s;he concluded her&s;elf ruined, and was overwhelmed with fear and con&s;ternation. The agitation of her mind produced violent fits, of which Henry being informed, he vi&s;ited her in her chamber, and &s;poke to her with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, as very much contributed to her recovery. Next night &s;he waited upon the King in his apartment; and he turning the conver&s;ation upon religious di&s;putes, &s;he &s;aid, that, con&s;cious of the weakne&s;s of her &s;ex, &s;he, as in duty bound, would &s;ubmit, in the&s;e and all other points, to his &s;uperior judgment. Henry, &s;till piqued at her former oppo&s;ition, replied, "Not &s;o, by St. Mary! you are become a Doctor, Kate, to in&s;truct, not to be in&s;tructed." She then very artfully a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he &s;hould never have pre&s;umed to argue with him on any &s;ubject, except to alleviate the pain of his infirmities, or with a view to profit by his &s;upe|rior learning. Hearing this declaration, "Is it even &s;o, &s;weetheart (&s;aid he) then we are perfect friends a|gain." At parting, he embraced her with much cor|diality, a&s;&s;uring her, &s;he might depend upon his af|fection. On the day following, while he walked with her in the garden, the Chancellor appeared with the guard a&s;&s;embled, to conduct her, and &s;everal other ladies, to the Tower. The King then, &s;tepping a&s;ide with him, was heard to call him knave, fool, bea&s;t, and ordered him to quit his pre&s;ence. The Queen, ignorant of his bu&s;ine&s;s, interceded in his favour; and Henry exclaimed, "Poor &s;oul, thou little knowe&s;t
<PB N="59" REF="60">how ill he de&s;erves thy good offices!" The King was totally alienated from the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter by his conduct on this occa&s;ion. He expelled him from the council; and though that Prelate evaded further di&s;|grace and puni&s;hment by the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he could never retrieve any &s;hare of his Sovereign's favour. However liable Henry was to be wrought up to a fury by artful &s;ugge&s;tions, to the prejudice of any per&s;on, he never liked the accu&s;ers. When after the death of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, which happened on Augu&s;t 24, the preceding year, his Ma|je&s;ty came fir&s;t to the council chamber, he appeared very melancholy; and being a&s;ked the rea&s;on, &s;aid, "It was the &s;eeing a vacancy, where the Duke of Suffolk u&s;ed to &s;it in council; whom he could not but lament, &s;ince, when he was offended with any body, the Duke always laboured to mitigate his di&s;|plea&s;ure, and never &s;poke ill of any per&s;on; which (looking upon the Lords of the council, one after another) none of them could &s;ay for him&s;elf."</P>
<P>The Duke of Norfolk had certainly a great hand, if not in the attempt again&s;t the Queen, at lea&s;t in the de&s;ign formed again&s;t Cranmer. Whether the part he acted in that affair contributed to it, or no, he fell &s;oon after into di&s;grace, and was &s;ent (as his &s;on Henry Earl of Surry was al&s;o) on December 12, to the Tower of London. The Earl had been chagrined at being recalled from the government of the Boulonnois, and at the Earl of Hertford's being &s;ent to command the forces in that country: this had provoked him to drop &s;ome threatening expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the coun&s;ellors, as well as a di&s;like at the King. The Duke, who, by &s;ome unhappy defect in his moral qualities, had quar|relled with two of his nieces, when Queens of England, and in the height of their power, had now a quarrel upon his hands with his own wife, and, by an effect of his own or her pride, his licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or her jea|lou&s;y, they had been parted upwards of four years, and
<PB N="60" REF="61">expre&s;&s;ed their rancour again&s;t one another &s;o openly, as to give great &s;candal on &s;everal occa&s;ions. She had long ago, in a fit of anger, &s;urmi&s;ed two articles again&s;t him; and &s;he now averred them, charging others al&s;o his confidents. One Mrs. Holland, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, di&s;covered all &s;he knew of the Duke, though it &s;eems only to have been &s;ome com|plaints of his, that he was not beloved by the King, who thought him too popular, nor by his coun&s;ellors, who, being men of low birth, hated him for his &s;upe|rior quality. Some points of an higher nature were charged upon him, by Sir Richard Southwell, a mem|ber of the Privy Council; but he denied them, and offered to maintain his innocence by a duel.</P>
<P>A. D. 1547.] The Earl of Surry was convicted of trea&s;on on January 13, and on the 19th of that month was beheaded on Tower-hill. The Duke acknowledg|ing him&s;elf to have been guilty of high trea&s;on, and confe&s;&s;ing he de&s;erved to be attainted for it, humbly &s;ued for the King's mercy and compa&s;&s;ion; which it is que&s;tioned whether he would have obtained, had the King lived.</P>
<P>The King had for &s;ome time felt him&s;elf drawing gradually to his end, his drop&s;y growing daily wor&s;e: and having taken care, on December 11, to e&s;tabli&s;h the noble foundation of Trinity college in Cambridge, made his will on the 30th of that month, "leaving the crown to his &s;on Edward, and his daughters Mary and Elizabeth, and their i&s;&s;ue in their re&s;pective orders; in default of whom to the heirs of his nieces Frances and Eleanor daughters of his &s;i&s;ter Mary late Queen of France, by Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, her &s;econd hu&s;band, and after them to the next lawful heir: &s;o that the children of his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter Margaret, Queen of Scotland, were excluded from their rank in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. he willed that his own daughters &s;hould forfeit their right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould they marry without the con&s;ent of the Privy Council. In the mean time, to each of them he left ten thou&s;and
<PB N="61" REF="62">pounds, by way of dower, and three thou&s;and for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, until they &s;hould be married. The Queen was intitled to three thou&s;and pounds in plate, and one thou&s;and in money, over and above her join|ture. He left &s;ix hundred pounds a-year in land, to the Dean and Chapter of Wind&s;or, for the maintenance of thirteen poor knights, and other pious u&s;es. His executors were directed to pay his debts, repair any injuries he might have unknowingly committed, and confirm all his grants and promi&s;es not perfected at the time of his decea&s;e. Legacies were left to each of the executors, and many of his faithful &s;ervants. On the third day of January he pa&s;&s;ed a grant of St. Bartholomew's ho&s;pital, with the &s;cite of the Franci&s;|can or Grey Friers church, now called Chri&s;t-church, and five hundred marks a year, to the city of London. Though Henry believed his malady incurable, per|haps he did not think death &s;o very near; and no per|&s;on would venture to tell him his &s;ituation, until Sir Anthony Denny, out of Chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion, ex|horted him to take care of his &s;oul, as he, in all pro|bability, had not many hours of life to enjoy. He thanked him for his charitable candour, owned he had been a great &s;inner; but expre&s;&s;ed his confidence in the mercies of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thevet, a friar of the Franci&s;can order, which had &s;uffered much for their e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of Queen Catherine, &s;ays, in his Co&s;mography, that, when Henry was on his death-bed, he profe&s;&s;ed an hearty &s;orrow for the treatment of Anne Boleyn.</NOTE>. When Denny propo&s;ed a gho&s;tly director, he de&s;ired him to &s;end for Archbi&s;hop Cran|mer, who had retired to Croydon, that he might not be pre&s;ent, nor concerned in the &s;candalous bill of attainder again&s;t the Duke of Norfolk, who had always been his enemy. Before he reached the palace, on Friday, January 28, Henry was &s;peechle&s;s, though not in&s;en&s;ible; for, when the Archbi&s;hop de&s;ired him to make &s;ome &s;ign of dying in the faith of Chri&s;t, he &s;queezed his hand with &s;eeming fervour, and in a few
<PB N="62" REF="63">minutes expired, being then in the &s;ix and fiftieth year of his age. The King's death happening between the date of the warrant and the execution, the Duke of Norfolk was &s;aved by this providential interpo&s;i|tion; though there &s;eems to have been &s;ome di&s;pute in the council about his fate, for they concealed his Maje&s;ty's decea&s;e for three days; and then the Lord Chancellor declared the parliament di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Henry VIII.<NOTE PLACE="inter">His cha|racter.</NOTE> before he became corpulent, was a Prince of a goodly per&s;onage, and commanding a&s;pect, rather imperious than dignified. He excelled in all the exerci&s;es of youth, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good under|&s;tanding, which was not much improved by the nature of his education. In&s;tead of learning that philo&s;ophy which opens the mind, and extends the qualities of the heart, he was confined to the &s;tudy of gloomy and &s;cho|la&s;tic di&s;qui&s;itions, which &s;erved to cramp the ideas, and pervert the faculties of rea&s;on, qualifying him for the di&s;putant of a cloi&s;ter, rather than the lawgiver of a people. In the fir&s;t years of his reign, his pride and vanity &s;eemed to domineer over all his other pa&s;&s;ions, though from the beginning he was impetuous, head|&s;trong and impatient of contradiction and advice; and perhaps the&s;e qualities might contribute to enable him to govern a people, who &s;eldom obey &s;o well, as when a &s;trict hand is kept over them, and are &s;ometimes apt to de&s;pi&s;e mild, and trample upon weak, Princes. He was ra&s;h, arrogant, prodigal, vain-glorious, pedantic, and &s;uper&s;titious. He delighted in pomp and pageantry, the baubles of a weak mind. His pa&s;&s;ions &s;oothed by adulation, rejected all re&s;traint: and as he was an utter &s;tranger to the finer feelings of the &s;oul, he gra|tified them at the expence of ju&s;tice and humanity, without remor&s;e or compunction. He wre&s;ted the &s;u|premacy from the Bi&s;hop of Rome, partly on con&s;cien|tious motives, and partly for rea&s;ons of &s;tate and con|venience. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the mona&s;teries, in order to
<PB N="63" REF="64">&s;upply his extravagance with their &s;poils; but he would not have made tho&s;e acqui&s;itions &s;o ea&s;ily, had they not been productive of advantage to his nobility, and agreeable to great part of the nation. He was frequently at war, but the greate&s;t conque&s;t he ob|tained was over his own parliament and people. Re|ligious di&s;putes had divided them into two factions. As he had it in his power to make either &s;cale prepon|derate, each courted his favour with the mo&s;t ob&s;e|quious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and in trimming the ballance he kept them both in &s;ubjection. In accu&s;toming them|&s;elves to the&s;e abject compliances, they degenerated into &s;laves; and he from their pro&s;titution acquired the mo&s;t de&s;potic authority. He became rapacious, arbitrary, froward, fretful, and &s;o cruel that he &s;eemed to take a delight in the blood of his &s;ubjects. He &s;eldom betrayed any &s;ymptoms of tenderne&s;s in his di&s;po&s;ition, and his kindne&s;s to Cranmer was an in|con&s;i&s;tency in his character. He &s;eemed to live in defiance of cen&s;ure, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;ecular; he died in apprehen&s;ion of futurity; and was buried at Wind&s;or with idle proce&s;&s;ions, which in tho&s;e days pa&s;&s;ed for real ta&s;te and magnificence.</P>

<P>EDWARD VI. &s;ucceeded his father on the throne of England, being then in the tenth year of his age. He had been educated under the care of Dr. Richard Cox and Sir John Cheeke; and when his fa|ther made his exit, was with his &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth at Hertford, from whence he was conducted by his uncle Edward Seymour Earl of Hertford, and Sir Thomas Brown, to the Tower of London, where he was received by the council in a body, and proclaimed King of England. Next day, the late King's will being opened, it appeared that Edward's majority was fixed at the age of fifteen: that &s;ixteen per&s;ons were nominated as executors of the will, regents of the kingdom, and tutors to the young King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were Thomas Cranmer Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor Wriothe&s;ly, Lord St. John Steward of the hou&s;hold, Lord Ru&s;&s;el keeper of the Privy Seal, the Earl of Hertford Lord Chamberlain, John Dudley Vi&s;count Li&s;le (in the &s;equel Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland) Cuthbert Ton&s;tal Bi&s;hop of Durham, Sir Anthony Brown Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, Sir William Pa|get Secretary of State, Sir Edward North Chancellor of the Court of Augmentation, Sir Edward Montague Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, Mr. Bromley one of the twelve Judges, Sir Anthony Denny, Sir William Herbert Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber, Sir Edward Wotton Trea&s;urer of Calais, and Dr. Wotton Dean of Canterbury and York. Stephen Gardiner Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter had been in the li&s;t, but his name was expunged from the will by Henry's own hand.</NOTE>; and that the&s;e, or the majority of them, were impowered to regulate the affairs of the admini&s;tration. They likewi&s;e found
<PB N="65" REF="66">another council appointed to be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the executors, when called upon for their advice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The a&s;&s;i&s;ting council con&s;i&s;ted of Henry Fitz-Alan Earl of Arundel, William Parr Earl of E&s;&s;ex (&s;oon after Marquis of Nor|thampton) Sir Thomas Cheney Trea&s;urer, Sir John Gage Comp|troller of the Hou&s;hold, Sir Anthony Wingfield Chamberlain, Sir William Petre Secretary of State, Sir Richard Rich, Sir John Baker, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Richard Southwell, and Sir Edward Peckham.</NOTE>. Henry's will being read in public, the regents and coun&s;ellors immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their re&s;pec|tive offices. Then &s;ome of the members ob&s;erving, that it would be trouble&s;ome to the people, and e&s;pe|cially to foreign mini&s;ters, to addre&s;s them&s;elves to &s;ixteen different per&s;ons of equal authority, propo&s;ed, that one of the number &s;hould be cho&s;en as chief and pre&s;ident, under the title of protector. This propo&s;al was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by Sir Thomas Wriothe&s;ley, Lord Chancellor, who fore&s;aw the choice would fall on the Earl of Hertford, with whom he had been long at variance, on account of religion. His objections, however, were over-ruled; and Hertford was cho&s;en protector of the realm, and governor of the King's per&s;on, on this expre&s;s condition, that he &s;hould do nothing without the con&s;ent of the other regents. It having been in&s;inuated that the late King intended to make &s;ome promotions among his courtiers, evidences were examined touching tho&s;e intentions; and, in con|&s;equence of their depo&s;itions, there were &s;everal per&s;ons enobled, and others advanced to higher titles. Among tho&s;e &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed were the Earl of Hertford, pro|moted to the title of the Duke of Somer&s;et, Sir Thomas Wriothe&s;ley created Earl of Southampton, and Sir Thomas Seymour, the protector's brother, made Baron Seymour of Sudley, and appointed Admiral of Eng|land. About the &s;ame time, Somer&s;et was advanced to the offices of Lord Trea&s;urer and Earl Mar&s;hal, vacant by the condemnation of the Duke of Norfolk.
<PB N="66" REF="67">The ob&s;equies of Henry were &s;olemnized on February 13, and on the 20th the young King was crowned; on which occa&s;ion Archbi&s;hop Cranmer admoni&s;hed his Maje&s;ty, that, as Chri&s;t's vicar within his own do|mions, he was to take care that God &s;hould be truly wor&s;hipped, idolatry rooted out, his &s;ubjects pre&s;erved from &s;ubjection to the Bi&s;hop of Rome, and images removed from all the churches in his kingdom. At this juncture an amne&s;ty was publi&s;hed, from which however the Duke of Norfolk, Cardinal Pole, Edward Courteney, elde&s;t &s;on of the Marquis of Exeter, and three others per&s;ons, were excluded.</P>
<P>The Earl of Southampton, being a man of a fiery, ambitious, turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, who&s;e politics and re|ligion were different from tho&s;e of the protector, this la&s;t re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity to expell him from the regency. He had granted a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal to certain &s;ub&s;titutes, to hear and decide cau&s;es in chancery, in the &s;ame manner as if him&s;elf were pre&s;ent. This &s;tep he had taken of his own &s;imple authority, without the con&s;ent of the King or the other regents. This affair being communicated to the council, the judges were ordered to give their opinion on the &s;ubject; and they unanimou&s;ly declared, that the Chancellor could not delegate his power to any other per&s;ons, without the con&s;ent of the King and regency, otherwi&s;e he forfeited his office, and be|came liable to fine and impri&s;onment. When this de|claration was intimated to him in full council, he in|veighed again&s;t the Judges, and even reviled the council and protector. His behaviour exa&s;perated the members to &s;uch a degree, that he was confined to his own hou&s;e, and deprived of the great &s;eal; but he was afterwards relea&s;ed from confinement, on his giving &s;e|curity for the payment of the fine to which he &s;hould be adjudged. Having removed this trouble&s;ome op|ponent, Somer&s;et informed his colleagues, that the foreign amba&s;&s;adors &s;crupled to treat with him until they
<PB N="67" REF="68">knew the extent of his power; and de&s;ired that his pro|tector&s;hip &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by patent. They deemed the propo&s;al rea&s;onable, and joined with him in a petition to the King, who, by patent, March 12, con&s;tituted the Duke of Somer&s;et governor of his per&s;on, and protector of his realm and &s;ubjects. He had all the regeney (except the Earl of Southampton) and the twelve additional coun&s;ellors, a&s;&s;igned to him for ad|vi&s;ers; but they were tied up from doing any thing without his con&s;ent and advice; whereas he was im|powered to admit to the privy council any per&s;on whom he might think proper, and in conjunction with any number of the coun&s;ellors, whom he &s;hould chu&s;e to convene, to annul or change whatever they thought fit to alter or aboli&s;h. By this he enlarged his own authority, but entailed the hatred and envy of many of the nobility, which he felt &s;everely in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Henry VIII. had no &s;ooner given up the gho&s;t, than the friends of the reformation congratulated them|&s;elves on the event. They no longer &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments on religion; but maintained their doctrines openly in preaching and teaching, even whil&s;t the laws continued again&s;t them in full force. Indeed, at this juncture, they had very little to fear from their ad|ver&s;aries. The King him&s;elf was bred up in the re|formed religion, and had already given &s;urpri&s;ing proofs of genius, capacity, and an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, aver&s;e to cruelty and per&s;ecution. The protector profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame doctrines, which were e&s;pou&s;ed by Thomas Cranmer and Robert Holgate, primates of Canterbury and York, Henry Holbech Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, Tho|mas Goodrich of Ely, and William Barlow of St. David's, together with Dr. Nicholas Ridley. Hugh Latimer late Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, by this time relea&s;ed from his pri&s;on (to which he had been &s;ent &s;oon after the re&s;ignation of his &s;ee) and though he declined the re&s;umption of his epi&s;copal character, living in a private manner with Cranmer, yet neverthele&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted very
<PB N="68" REF="69">much in the work of reformation by his talents in preaching<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 13 of this volume.</NOTE>. Bi&s;hop Gardiner, perceiving, that, &s;ince the regency, and the people in general, favoured a reformation, his oppo&s;ition would be of very little &s;ervice to Popery, endeavoured to check the progre&s;s of Prote&s;tant tenets, by repre&s;enting to the protector, that innovations during a minority would produce confu&s;ion and di&s;turbance in the &s;tate, and propo&s;ing that religious matters &s;hould continue as they were at the death of the late King, until the reigning Prince &s;hould take the reigns of government into his own hands. Very little regard was paid to the&s;e in&s;inua|tions, although Gardiner was &s;upported by Edmund Bonner Bi&s;hop of London, and Cuthbert Ton&s;tal of Durham: but the chief of the party was the Prince&s;s Mary, who openly avowed the regulations of her fa|ther, and particularly the act of the &s;ix articles. The inferior clergy derived their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the &s;acramental fees, and e&s;pecially by &s;inging of ma&s;&s;es for the departed &s;ouls of the poor, for which they received two-pence a ma&s;s; and therefore were ene|mies to the reformation and alteration of the church-&s;ervice. Neverthele&s;s, the regency, who had &s;upplied the Prote&s;tants of Germany with 30,000 crowns, appointed, at Cranmer's in&s;tance, a general vi&s;itation of all the churches in England; of which more fully afterwards.</P>
<P>The Duke of Somer&s;et's next attention was to the war with Scotland. Henry had, in his la&s;t illne&s;s, laid &s;trong injunctions upon his executors to effect, if po&s;|&s;ible, the match between his &s;on and Mary Queen of that country. The French party prevailing in Scot|land, there was but little pro&s;pect of executing what he &s;o much de&s;ired, in any other way but by force of arms: the protector therefore began to make prepa|rations for pro&s;ecuting the war with Scotland, while
<PB N="69" REF="70">the French King declared, that he would not abandon his old allies in their di&s;tre&s;s. At the in&s;tance of the French amba&s;&s;adors, Somer&s;et con&s;ented to try the effect of negociation, before he &s;hould commence any ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>The negociation proving fruitle&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Battle of Pinkey.</NOTE> the pro|tector entered Scotland, in the beginning of September, with an army of fifteen thou&s;and infantry, and three thou&s;and hor&s;e, well appointed, provided with a train of artillery. The Scotch, having rai&s;ed an army of 30,000 men; well provided with am|munition, arms and ordinance, took po&s;t near Mu&s;sle|burgh, within four miles of Edinburgh, in order to attack the Engli&s;h in their march. The famous battle of Pinkey or Mu&s;sleburgh en&s;ued, on September 10, when the Scotch, having maintained an advantageous po&s;t, which the Engli&s;h dur&s;t not attack them in, abandoned it, imagining the Engli&s;h about to retreat, and fearing they &s;hould e&s;cape in the night, drew their forces up in a line of battle, and advanced to attack them. Their impetuo&s;ity not only &s;aved the Engli&s;h (then in want of provi&s;ions) from a dangerous retreat, but threw victory into the hands of Somer&s;et, who&s;e troops made a mo&s;t horrible carnage among the Scotch, with incon&s;iderable lo&s;s to them&s;elves. The Duke of So|mer&s;et was prevented from availing him&s;elf of the con&s;ternation which filled Scotland immediately after this battle, and from improving the other advantages of his &s;ucce&s;s, by the intrigues of his brother in England. Having plundered and burned Leith, and all the neighbouring villages on the &s;ea-&s;ide, made an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempt on the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and for|tified Inchcolm, in the Firth of Forth, with Broughty ca&s;tle near the mouth of the Tay, he returned to Eng|land, where he was rewarded by the King with lands to the value of five hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>The Duke of Somer&s;et acquired great popularity by this pro&s;perous expedition; but at the &s;ame time
<PB N="70" REF="71">attracted the envy of &s;everal noblemen: nor did he &s;eem to bear his fortune with moderation. Thomas, Lord Sudley,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Intrigues again&s;t the protector by his brother.</NOTE> High Admiral, a man of uncommon talents, but proud, turbulent and untractable, was in the number of tho&s;e who envied the pro&s;perity of the pro|tector. He beheld, with di&s;content, the di&s;tinction which King Henry made between him and his elder bro$$er, with whom he thought him&s;elf equally inti|titled to a $$are in the admini&s;tration. Sudley had ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Prince&s;s Elizabeth on the &s;core of marriage; but not &s;ucceeding in that pur&s;uit, he in|&s;inuated him&s;elf into the affection of the Queen Dowa|ger, Catherine Parr, who gave him her hand in pri|vate, immediately after the death of Henry. He found means to obtain from the King a letter, ex|pre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ire that &s;uch a match &s;hould be effected, and then he publi&s;hed his marriage in open defiance of the protector. He made a party among the nobi|lity, who, as they hated his brother, fomented his am|bition. And young Edward going frequently to his hou&s;e, to &s;ee his &s;tep mother, he ingratiated him&s;elf with his &s;overeign, by an affected affability, officiou&s;|ne&s;s, and complai&s;ance, and &s;upplying him with money, without the knowledge of his governor. While the protector was in Scotland, he redoubled all his art and in&s;inuation, and obtained, from the King, a new patent for admiral, with an additional appointment. Before Somer&s;et arrived, he had engaged in his party &s;ome privy coun&s;ellors, &s;everal noblemen of di&s;tinction, and a great number of the members of the lower hou&s;e of parliament. He prevailed on the King to write a letter to the two hou&s;es of parliament, de&s;iring the Ad|miral might be appointed his governor; but, before this was delivered, the council, being appri&s;ed of his de|&s;ign, &s;ent to a&s;&s;ure him if he did not de&s;i&s;t, they would deprive him of his office, &s;end him to the Tower, and pro&s;ecute him on the la&s;t act of parliament, which
<PB N="71" REF="72">made it high trea&s;on to attempt di&s;turbing the order of government. Being intimidated at this, he hum|bled him&s;elf before the council, and was &s;eemingly reconciled to the protector.</P>
<P>During Somer&s;et's ab&s;ence, the per&s;ons appointed to vi&s;it the churches, had performed their ta&s;k without oppo&s;ition, except from Gardiner Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and Bonner Bi&s;hop of London, who refu&s;ed to obey the order of council, and were therefore committed to pri&s;on. The Lord Rich was created Chancellor; and the parliament, meeting on November 4, manife&s;ted the greate&s;t attachment to the protector. They repealed all the acts touching high trea&s;on, which had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the reign of Edward III. all acts of felony &s;pecified &s;ince the rupture with the Pope; the &s;tatute which ve&s;ted the King's proclamation with the power of an act of parlia|ment; two acts pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Lollards; and the famous &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles. The King's &s;upremacy was confirmed anew; and the pains of trea&s;on were decreed again&s;t tho&s;e heirs of the crown mentioned in Henry's will, who &s;hould attempt to di&s;turb the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The benefit of clergy, and the privi|leges of &s;anctuary, were re&s;tored; from the&s;e however, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and four &s;ort of thieves, were excluded. Pri|vate ma&s;&s;es were prohibited, and the people permitted to receive the communion in both &s;pecies. The King was impowered to fill vacant bi&s;hoprics, &s;o that &s;ham $ections were entirely aboli&s;hed. The cognizance of matrimonial or te&s;tamentary cau&s;es was transferred from eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, to tho&s;e of the regal juri&s;diction; and they pa&s;&s;ed a law, enacting, that if any common per&s;on &s;hould refrain from working, or at lea&s;t from offering to work, for the &s;pace of three days, he &s;hould be branded in the face with a red hot iron, and be|come the &s;lave of the informer. This rigorous decree was levelled again&s;t the monks, who, &s;ince the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the mona&s;teries, in&s;tead of working for their livelihood, &s;trolled from family to family, and endea|voured to breed di&s;turbance in the &s;tate. Finally, they
<PB N="72" REF="73">granted to Edward all the foundations for chantries, chapels, and colleges, of which Henry had not al|ready taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This act met with great op|po&s;ition from &s;everal prelates, and from Cranmer in particular. He hoped to find &s;ome opportunity of converting tho&s;e benefactions to religious purpo&s;es; whereas, by being in the hands of the King, the church would be deprived of them for ever. But he was not able to carry his point. The nobility thir&s;ted after the effects of the church, and the&s;e they ea&s;ily obtained from the court: and the executors of Henry's will wanted money to pay his debts and legacies. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was concluded with an act of amne&s;ty, from which the pri&s;oners in the Tower were excluded; but as Gardiner had been confined in the Fleet, he enjoyed the benefit of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>We have already taken notice of the &s;tate of the two parties who favoured and oppo&s;ed a reformation of tho&s;e innovations in doctrine, and &s;uper&s;titions in prac|tice, which the Popes, the monks, or &s;choolmen, had introduced in the days of ignorance: but the friends of prote&s;tanti&s;m lay under &s;ome di&s;advantages by rea|&s;on of Edward's minority, and a &s;trong party in op|po&s;ition to their de&s;igns: and as we have given a detail of the mo&s;t remarkable civil tran&s;actions, we &s;hall now proceed to give an account of the &s;teps taken, as well before as in the convocation, for re|moving of the cau&s;es of complaint. It was probably with a view to pave the way for this work, that Cran|mer had taken out, on February 7, a royal commi&s;&s;ion, impowering him to exerci&s;e, during the King's plea|&s;ure, all manner of coercive juri&s;diction in all cau&s;es cognizable by &s;piritual courts and eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, over and above the powers committed in the &s;criptures by divine authority. It hath always been a maxim in the law of England, that all coactive juri&s;diction is derived from the crown, no court can be held, no oath admini&s;tered, but in virtue of the royal authority;
<PB N="73" REF="74">and when Robert Gro&s;thead (alias Grouthead) Bi&s;hop of Lincoln from 1235 to 1254, in his zeal for reform|ing the lives and manners of per&s;ons that lay under an evil fame, fir&s;t offered to introduce the oath <HI>ex officio,</HI> for di&s;covery of &s;ecret lewdne&s;s that gave no &s;candal, it occa&s;ioned a complaint of parliament, and, had it not been for his extraordinary merit, and known inte|grity, would have been &s;everely puni&s;hed. Bracton, an eminent Engli&s;h lawyer, who flouri&s;hed in the 13th century, and wrote a book <HI>de con&s;uetudinibus Angliae,</HI> &s;aith, "That matters relating to juri&s;diction, peace, and ju&s;tice, belong to none but the crown and dig|nity royal, nor can they be &s;eparated from the crown, nor be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any private per&s;on." Cau&s;es of te&s;taments, matrimony, adultery, and illegitimacy, being &s;ubjected by William the Conqueror to the cog|nizance of eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;piritual per&s;ons, were for that rea&s;on commonly called eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and the courts, wherein they were tried, denominated &s;pi|ritual: but tho&s;e judicatures were erected by the civil power, and the exerci&s;e of their juri&s;diction became difficult after the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;ome acts in the late reign, for e&s;tabli&s;hing the King's &s;upremacy, and aboli&s;hing all eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, repugnant either to the laws of the land, or the royal prerogative. Thirty two com|mi&s;&s;ioners had been appointed to revi&s;e tho&s;e laws; but they had made no report; and it was &s;till uncertain what particular canons or con&s;titutions might be deemed by common lawyers to come under that cha|racter. Cranmer and all the Bi&s;hops at that time had been put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ees, in con&s;equence of the Pope's bulls: and occa&s;ion might thence have been taken to &s;ugge&s;t, that they exerci&s;ed their ordi|nary juri&s;diction, as Wol&s;ey had done his legatine, in virtue of the papal authority, which would &s;ubject them to a premunire. This had rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for them in point of prudence to take out commi&s;&s;ions from Henry for exerci&s;ing their juri&s;diction, in &s;ubor|dination
<PB N="74" REF="75">to his authority, and for as long as he thought proper. Cranmer, either out of an abundant caution, or to &s;et an example for making other Prelates depen|dant on the King and Council, thought fit, upon the expiration of that commi&s;&s;ion which he had received from Henry, to take out a new one from Edward. Bonner, and the re&s;t of the Bi&s;hops, took out the like commi&s;&s;ions, for exerci&s;ing their juri&s;diction during the King's plea&s;ure: but, whatever alarm &s;eized them at fir&s;t, the Bi&s;hops &s;oon got over their fears, and &s;uch commi&s;&s;ions were reputed needle&s;s; Ridley not having any when promoted to the &s;ee of London, and none being ever i&s;&s;ued afterwards.</P>
<P>The advocates for Popery could not complain of the vi&s;itation of the churches being an inno|vation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A general vi|&s;itation of the churches in England.</NOTE> as it agreed with the late King's injunctions, which had been publi&s;hed, though not duly executed, in his time; and the people were more ready to receive it, as they had &s;ome knowledge of it be|fore. Cranmer, and his friends, obtained letters-patent from the regency for a vi&s;itation over Eng|land, during which all Bi&s;hops were prohibited from preaching in any place but their own cathe|drals, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics were re&s;tricted to their re&s;pective churches, unle&s;s provided with the King's &s;pecial licence. The kingdom was divided into &s;ix &s;eparate di&s;tricts or circuits; and the number of vi&s;itors, for each, con&s;i&s;ted of two gentlemen, a civilian, a divine, and a regi&s;ter. They were armed, as well with powers for enquiring into all eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, as with injunctions which all per&s;ons were required to ob&s;erve. The&s;e enjoined the clergy to take care, that the laws again&s;t the papacy, and for a&s;&s;erting the royal &s;upremacy, were duly ob&s;erved; and to teach their congregations, at lea&s;t four times a year, that the fir&s;t had been ju&s;tly aboli&s;hed, as a mere u&s;urpation, and the latter a rightful power, which it was their duty to
<PB N="75" REF="76">ob$$. They were to per&s;uade the people from pil|grimages, wor&s;hip of images, and other &s;uper&s;titious practices; to take down and de&s;troy &s;uch images as had been &s;o abu&s;ed; and to &s;uffer no more wax candles or tapers to be burnt before any image. All &s;hrines, rolls of wax, paintings, and other monuments of ido|latry, and feigned miracles, were to be removed out of the walls and windows of churches: and a pulpit was to be erected in every church for preaching<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a form of <HI>bidding-prayer</HI> enjoined by the vi&s;itors, to be u&s;ed by all preachers. The latter part of it run thus: "You are to pray for all them that be departed out of this world in the faith of Chri&s;t, that they with us, and we with them, at the day of judge|ment, may re&s;t both in body and &s;oul with Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven."</NOTE>. Upon every holiday, when there was no &s;ermon, the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the ten commandments, were to be recited out of the pulpit to the pari&s;hioners: and all that came to confe&s;&s;ion in Lent, were to be exa|mined, whether they could repeat them before they were admitted to the &s;acrament. The epi&s;tle and go&s;|pel, at high ma&s;s, were to be read in Engli&s;h; and, on every Sunday and holiday, a chapter of the New Te&s;tament was to be read in the morning, and one of the Old at evening, &s;ervice, in Engli&s;h. All proce&s;&s;ions in the church and church-yard, were forbidden; and the litany, which u&s;ed to be &s;ung in them, was for the future to be &s;aid or &s;ung in the choir, in Engli&s;h. A regi&s;ter was to be carefully kept in every pari&s;h, for marriages, chri&s;tenings, and burials: and no body was to preach any where, be&s;ides in his own church, with|out a &s;pecial licence. In churches, where they had not an Engli&s;h Bible of the larger &s;ize, one was to be provided in three months; and, before a year expired, Era&s;mus's Paraphra&s;e of the four Go&s;pels, and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, lately tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, was likewi&s;e to be provided, and placed in every church for people to read therein. Every clergyman, under the
<PB N="76" REF="77">degree of Batchelor of Divinity, was al&s;o obliged to procure a copy of the &s;ame paraphra&s;e for his own u&s;e and Bi&s;hops were, by them&s;elves or their officers, to examine what proficiency they made in the &s;tudy o$ the &s;criptures. The Bi&s;hops were particularly charged to &s;ee the&s;e injunctions ob&s;erved in their dioce&s;es; and to &s;et forth nothing contrary to the doctrine contained in the homilies, publi&s;hed by authority.</P>
<P>The&s;e homilies had been approved in the convo|cation, A. D. 1542: and the vi&s;itors carried with them copies thereof, which were delivered to the mi|ni&s;ters of pari&s;hes, for the in&s;truction of their congre|gations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The generality of the common people had e&s;teemed the prie&s;t as mountebanks, who had charms or &s;ecrets for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, and therefore thought nothing was further nece&s;&s;ary than to commit, implicitly, their &s;piritual concerns to the &s;kill of &s;uch emperi$$ Others were taught to believe, that, if they magnified Chri&s;t, and depended wholly upon his mercies and interce&s;&s;ion, they &s;hould be &s;aved, even though they led the mo&s;t profligate lives.

Some learned and eminent preachers attend|ed them likewi&s;e in their vi&s;itations; and exerted their talents wherever they pa&s;&s;ed, in teaching people the true principles of religion, and di&s;&s;uading them from praying to &s;aints, adoring images, the u&s;e of beads, candles, a&s;hes, palms, proce&s;&s;ions, and prayers in un|known languages. It was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, that the&s;e vi&s;itations &s;hould be made in May; but the vi&s;itors did not &s;et out till Augu&s;t; and the injunctions were every where pretty well received, and generally ob&s;erved. In &s;ome places, as at Port&s;mouth, and in London, at St. Martin's in Ironmongers-lane, the zeal of certain per&s;ons was too warm to wait a reformation from the vi|&s;itors, and, without any directions, they demoli&s;hed the images and pictures of &s;aints that were in the churches and, to &s;et an example to the re&s;t of the kingdom, the
<PB N="77" REF="78"><HI>compline</HI> (a part of the evening &s;ervice) had been &s;ung on the Ea&s;ter Monday, in the Engli&s;h tongue, in the King's chapel.

<P>There appeared at the &s;ame time &s;everal books writ|ten by the partizans of Papacy; &s;ome of them by Gar|diner Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; all exclaiming again&s;t the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the &s;criptures, which they did not think proper to be communicated to the people, for fear of promoting di&s;&s;en&s;ions in religion; though they oppo&s;ed, with vehemence, the removing of images, which had been notoriou&s;ly abu&s;ed to the practice of idolatry. The &s;chool di&s;tinction between material and formal idolatry,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Reflections up|on images and pictures in churches.</NOTE> and the pretences that the wor&s;hip, though direct|ed immediately towards the image, doth not terminate there, but in the per&s;on re|pre&s;ented, or in Chri&s;t him&s;elf, &s;eem de&s;igned to tre|pan people into a practice abhorred by the primitive Chri&s;tians: and in places where images are retained, con&s;tant experence &s;hews how impracticable it is, by any in&s;tructions, to re&s;train the ignorant people from falling into gro&s;s idolatry. The apologi&s;ts for the Chri&s;tian religion, and the works of the fathers, of the fir&s;t four hundred years of the go&s;pel, afford irrefra|gable
<PB N="78" REF="79">proofs of the dete&s;tation, they univer&s;ally had, of all images and pictures u&s;ed in religious wor&s;hip. They would &s;uffer none in their churches; and the zeal of St. Epiphanius, who flouri&s;hed at the latter end of the fourth century, in tearing and de&s;troying the picture (probably of &s;ome &s;aint) painted on a veil, which he chanced to &s;ee in his travels, is the more re|markable, becau&s;e it was in a church where he had no juri&s;diction, that he &s;hewed this in&s;tance of his in|dignation. The plea of the wor&s;hip's being directed, not &s;o much to the image or picture, as to the invi&s;ible Being they were de&s;igned to repre&s;ent, did not then &s;erve for a ju&s;t excu&s;e. Aaron and the I&s;raelites con|&s;idered the golden calf only as a &s;ymbolical repre&s;enta|tion of the true God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt; and the fea&s;t, which they celebrated in its honour, was proclaimed by Aaron as a fea&s;t to the Lord, to Jehovah, the appropriate name of the true God: and yet they were guilty of idolatry. If the common people, who are much alike in all countries and ages, among the Heathen were &s;o &s;tupid as to ter|minate their wor&s;hip in an image, their philo&s;ophers did not renounce their rea&s;on &s;o far as to mi&s;take the idol for a Deity. They almo&s;t univer&s;ally believed one &s;upreme, infinite, eternal mind, that gave being to the world, and all things therein; but as he was invi&s;ible and incomprehen&s;ible, they thought they might wor|&s;hip him in his vi&s;ible effects, and by corporeal repre|&s;entations; but to him was their wor&s;hip ultimately directed. Any per&s;on, acquainted with the mytho|logy of the ancients, knows this to be the ca&s;e; and it appears from the writings of Origen, Arnobius, and Eu&s;ebius, again&s;t them, that the&s;e were their real &s;en|timents, and that they made this apology for them&s;elves, though it did not &s;ave them from the guilt of idola|try.</P>
<P>The injunctions were readily received by all the Bi&s;hops, except Gardiner Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and
<PB N="79" REF="80">Bonner Bi&s;hop of London, as before-mentioned. Gardi|ner, being called before the council, affirmed, that the homilies contained manife&s;t contradictions, and excluded charity from ju&s;tification. He offered to di&s;pute upon this &s;ubject, at Oxford, again&s;t any opponent &s;oever; and he exclaimed again&s;t the paraphra&s;e of Era&s;mus, which he &s;aid was bad enough in the original, but much wor&s;e in the tran&s;lation. Notwith&s;tanding all his ar|guments, he was &s;ent to the Fleet, from whence he &s;ent a letter, in vindication of him&s;elf, to the Protec|tor upon his return from Scotland; and the Prince&s;s Mary al&s;o wrote to that Nobleman in the Prelate's be|half: but Somer&s;et paid very little regard to their re|mon&s;trances, and Gardiner remained in pri&s;on till the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, when he obtained his liberty by the act of indemnity before mentioned. Bon|ner being &s;ummoned before the vi&s;itors in the cathe|dral of St. Paul, on October 1, and having a copy of the injunctions delivered to him, with the homilies publi&s;hed by authority, received them indeed, but with a prote&s;tation, "That he would ob&s;erve them if they were not contrary to the law of God and the &s;tatutes and ordinances of the church." He de&s;ired this prote&s;t might be enrolled among the acts of the court: but &s;oon after, "upon better con&s;idering his duty of obedience, and the evil example that might thence en&s;ue to others, it appeared to him neither rea|&s;onable nor con&s;i&s;tent with the duty of a &s;ubject; and therefore he revoked his prote&s;t, de&s;iring the Lords of the council, that his revocation thereof might likewi&s;e be put in the &s;ame records of the vi&s;itation, for a per|petual memory of the truth, and that they would me|diate with his Maje&s;ty for the pardon of his unadvi&s;ed action." This humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and retractation had &s;uch an effect upon the Lords, that, though they thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for a terror to others, and for a&s;&s;erting their own authority, to &s;hew their re&s;entment at the in&s;inuations couched in the prote&s;t, to the pre|judice
<PB N="80" REF="81">of the injunctions, and the exaltation of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical canons and con&s;titutions above the royal authority, to &s;end him, on September 11, to the Fleet, they &s;oon &s;et him at liberty, and he &s;at in the next parliament and convocation. He joined not only with the chapter of St. Paul's, in cau&s;ing the in|junctions to be ob&s;erved in that cathedral, where the litany was now &s;ung, and the epi&s;tle and go&s;pel read, in Engli&s;h, and all the images (that of Chri&s;t being called the <HI>Rood</HI>) taken down; but al&s;o with Bella&s;&s;ere, Archdeacon of Colche&s;ter, and Gilbert Bourn (after|wards Bi&s;hop of Bath, but then) Archdeacon of Lon|don and E&s;&s;ex, who were both very zealous and offi|cious in the work, in making the like reform in all the churches of London and the re&s;t of his dioce&s;e. This was done with &s;o much diligence, that, before the end of November, all images were removed thence, and divine &s;ervice performed according to the injunc|tions.</P>
<P>The convocation having met on November 5, the day after the meeting of the parliament, Archbi&s;hop Cranmer,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in convoca|tion, or at its in&s;tance.</NOTE> in a &s;peech, exhort|ed the clergy to an a&s;&s;iduity in &s;tudying the &s;criptures: and pre&s;&s;ed them to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, what things were in the church that needed reformation; in order to throw out all the Romi&s;h tra&s;h and novelties, which had not yet been removed. Some of them, on this occa&s;ion, intimating to him, that &s;o long as the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles &s;tood in force, it was not &s;afe to deliver their opinions, he repre&s;ented it to the council, which cau&s;ed that &s;tature's being repealed, as before related: but the re|peal provided, "That all who denied the King's &s;upre|macy, or a&s;&s;erted the Pope's, in words, &s;hould, for the fir&s;t offence, forfeit their goods and chattels, and be impri&s;oned during the King's plea&s;ure; for the &s;e|cond, incur the pains of a premunire; and for the third, be attainted of high trea&s;on.</P>

An affectation of more than ordinary purity and au&s;terity beginning to prevail, a motion was made, in the council of Nice, A. D. 325, for a law to prohibit the marriage of the clergy.

St. Gregory Na|zianzen's father was a Bi&s;hop, and begat him after his con&s;ecration. St. Jerome ob&s;erves, that, in his time, the married Bi&s;hops were numberle&s;s; and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops of Rome, even after the time of Leo the Great, who died A. D. 461, were the &s;ons of married prie&s;ts. Canons were indeed made, in &s;everal churches, re|&s;training the clergy from marrying, after they had been ordained: but they do not &s;eem to have been received in England; where even &s;uch as lived in mona|&s;teries and collegiate &s;ocieties, had their wives and fa|milies with them, till the conque&s;t, except in a few convents, reformed upon Dun&s;tan's plan by King Edgar. After the conque&s;t, Archbi&s;hop Lanfranc impo&s;ed celibacy upon the Prebendaries of cathedral and collegiate churches; but allowed the parochial clergy, living in towns and villages, the u&s;e of mar|riage already contracted. John de Crema, the Pope's Legate, got a canon pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ynod, in 1125, for turning all the married clergy out of their benefices: but it never took place in Wales, and was very little ob&s;erved in England. The compo&s;itions made with Henry I. and the protection he gave the married clergy, hindered the canon from being at fir&s;t put in execu|tion: and the Bi&s;hops, &s;eeing it could not be done without a &s;trong oppo&s;ition, and great di&s;turbances, cho&s;e to grant them licences for marrying &s;ecretly, and connived at their keeping wives in their hou&s;es, under the &s;tile of <HI>concubines,</HI> as was the ca&s;e of other we&s;tern churches. Some con&s;titutions were indeed made again&s;t &s;uch clande&s;tine marriages, but it was only for &s;hew; they were &s;eldom or never executed: and &s;ome Bi&s;hops<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The late famous M.

<PB N="85" REF="88">to live &s;ecretly with their wives till the time of the reformation. When the act pa&s;&s;ed, in the 27th of Henry VIII. empowering the Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury to grant licences, di&s;pen&s;ations, and faculties, in matters not contrary to the holy &s;criptures, and the laws of God, and declaring all &s;uch licence, &amp;c. &s;hould &s;tand in full force and authority, without being liable to any future repeal; &s;everal prie&s;ts obtained di&s;pen&s;a|tions of marriage, &s;ome of them corroborated by the King's great &s;eal, others only by the Archbi&s;hop. Henry being informed, by &s;ome of the Popi&s;h party, that many prie&s;ts, as well regular as &s;ecular, had been married without authority, did, at their in&s;tigation, publi&s;h, in the 30th year of his reign, a proclamation, forbidding that practice for the future, but not di&s;&s;ol|ving the marriages already contracted. The&s;e were, however, di&s;&s;olved in the next year, by the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, and many &s;o married were divorced: but a good number &s;till retained their wives, and, though the King was told of it from time to time, he willingly tolerated &s;uch as kept their marriages &s;ecret. As for tho&s;e, that were openly known to be married, he did not &s;eparate them from their wives, but ordered them to be reputed as lay-per&s;ons; and was inclined to give a full liberty in this point to all the clergy, had he not been hindered by &s;ome papal zealots in his coun|cil, as he declared his mind to &s;everal that he talked with on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of the clergy in England, when a propo&s;ition was laid before the lower hou&s;e of convocation to this effect,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Marriage of the clergy al|lowed by the convocation.</NOTE> "That all &s;uch canons, laws, &s;tatutes, decrees, cu&s;toms, and u&s;ages, heretofore made, had, or u&s;ed, that forbid any per&s;on to con|tract

<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">A new litur|gy compiled, and all preaching in|hibited till its e&s;tabli&s;h|ment.</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding all the caution u&s;ed in granting licences to preach, &s;everal of tho&s;e who had obtained them, &s;lighted the King's injunctions, and declaimed in the pulpit again&s;t his authority, as well as proceedings. Many al&s;o of the beneficed clergy, though they pretended to comply with every order, and had received the new communion-&s;ervice, did all they could to prejudice people again&s;t it: either curtailing it, or hurrying and &s;lubbering it over in &s;uch a man|ner, as to render it unintelligible; whil&s;t others, de|claring them&s;elves more openly, did not u&s;e it at all, but &s;aid their ma&s;&s;es as formerly. To correct the&s;e irregu|larities, and prevent the evil con&s;equences thereof, no method appeared &s;o likely to &s;ucceed, as the drawing up of a public liturgy, and getting it confirmed by
<PB N="90" REF="93">parliament, with penalties to be inflicted on all that &s;hould not conform to its rules and directions. The late order, for admini&s;tering the euchari&s;t, in the Engli&s;h tongue, had not yet received the &s;anction of that authority, being authori&s;ed only by the convoca|tion, and an act of the council of regency; and, tho' di&s;affected per&s;ons were apt to con&s;ider it as a proceed|ing, not &s;o much from the King him&s;elf as from a few per&s;ons about him, yet, when the King's plea&s;ure came to be known by an act of parliament, it might be pre&s;umed, that all evils being removed, every body would &s;ubmit to it, and conform without further trouble. With the&s;e expectations, the council, on September 1, &s;ent for the committee of Bi&s;hops and Divines, who had lately drawn up the communion-&s;ervice, and had been impowered likewi&s;e to revi&s;e and reform all the offices and divine &s;ervice: and re|commended to them the compiling of <HI>a public liturgy,</HI> which &s;hould contain the order or morning and even|ing prayer, together with a form of mini&s;tering the &s;acraments, and the like for all religious offices. They readily undertook the work, in which, it is very pro|bable, they had already made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s; and the King, by a proclamation, on the 23d of that month, notified it to all his &s;ubjects; "inhibiting at the &s;ame time all per&s;ons, whether licen&s;ed or not, from preach|ing in open audience, in the pulpit or otherwi&s;e, till the propo&s;ed liturgy &s;hould be publi&s;hed. The clergy were exhorted, in the mean time, to apply them&s;elves by prayers to God for the good execution and &s;ucce&s;s of the undertaking, and the people to be content with the homilies &s;et forth by authority, and prepare them|&s;elves with a thankful obedience, to receive a mo&s;t quiet, godly, and uniform order, throughout all his dominions."&mdash;There was then, and probably had always been, a great diver&s;ity in the forms of prayer, rites, and ceremonies, u&s;ed in the churches of England: but there were five liturgies more generally followed
<PB N="91" REF="94">than others, viz. tho&s;e for the u&s;e of the churches of Sarum, Lincoln, York, Bangor and Hereford. There was the like diver&s;ity in the divine offices of all Chri&s;|tian countries; it being a con&s;equence of the power ve&s;ted in all Bi&s;hops, and exerci&s;ed by them from the time of the Apo&s;tles, of appointing liturgies for their re&s;pective dioce&s;es: and this cau&s;ed &s;uch a variety therein, that an ancient eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torian ob&s;erves, "that there were &s;carce two churches to be found, which, in their rites and forms of prayer, agreed entirely with one another." Each religious order, as it was founded, had its peculiar liturgy; there were no le&s;s than fifty different volumes of different offices u&s;ed in the churches of the city of Rome, when Pope Nicholas III. in the thirteenth century, ordered them to be laid a&s;ide, to make way for the uniform ob&s;ervance of that which was u&s;ed in his own chapel: and Walafrid Strabo, who flou|ri&s;hed in the ninth century, &s;ays, in the fir&s;t chapter of his book, <HI>de rebus eccle&s;ia&s;ticis, et horis canonicis,</HI> "that in his time the diver&s;ity of offices was in a manner in|finite, not only with regard to different languages and nations, but even in the &s;ame province, according to the different in&s;titutions of Bi&s;hops. It could not rea&s;onably be expected, that any body &s;hould be &s;o perver&s;e, as to di&s;pute the authority of a national church, in ordering its own form of divine wor&s;hip, when every &s;ingle Bi&s;hop enjoyed the &s;ame power with|in his dioce&s;e.&mdash;It was likewi&s;e intended that the new liturgy &s;hould remove all di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and bring the people to an uniformity in their religious opinions, as well as in divine wor&s;hip. With this view it was &s;o contrived, as, not only by the portions of &s;cripture appointed for each day's &s;ervice in &s;uch an order, that the Old Te&s;tament &s;hould be read over once, and the New thrice, a-year, in every church in the realm, but likewi&s;e by the prayers them&s;elves, to in&s;truct people in all the e&s;&s;ential doctrines, and great duties, of the Chri&s;tian religion, that they might know what was
<PB N="92" REF="95">nece&s;&s;ary for them, either to practi&s;e or believe, in order to &s;alvation. No fea&s;ts in&s;tituted to &s;upport the notions of &s;choolmen, no prayers founded on &s;chola&s;|tic niceties, or the fabulous and uncertain legends of &s;aints, nothing but what is agreeable to the true, ge|nuine, clear, and indi&s;puted doctrines of the go&s;pel, found place in a compo&s;ition, which contained as ra|tional, as Chri&s;tian, and as in&s;tructive a body of de|votion, as was perhaps ever u&s;ed in public wor&s;hip. The con&s;tant u&s;e of &s;uch a liturgy has been generally allowed to be a more efficacious means of cultivating in people a religious turn of mind, of improving them in the knowledge of God, of keeping them in the faith of Chri&s;t, and of di&s;po&s;ing them to the practice of their duty, than all the &s;tudied harangues, and tran&s;ient ex|hortations of preachers: and to the&s;e ends it was ad|mirably adapted by the compilers. None of the&s;e ends could be advanced by the former offices, being in a language unknown to tho&s;e who mo&s;t wanted in&s;truc|tion. The effect likewi&s;e of what appeared mo&s;t com|mendable in tho&s;e offices was defeated, or impaired, by &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive multitude of u&s;ele&s;s rites and cere|monies, as became an intolerable grievance; &s;ome of them light and theatrical, others abu&s;ed to &s;uper&s;tition, and the re&s;t &s;erving to encourage &s;uch a reliance on ex|ternal ob&s;ervances, as naturally made them le&s;s careful in cultivating that inward purity and holine&s;s of mind; and in practi&s;ing tho&s;e duties of religion, which are required of every Chri&s;tian. The committee, charged with revi&s;ing tho&s;e offices, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to lop tho&s;e excre&s;cences, and to retrench tho&s;e clogs on ra|tional devotion and true religion; but took care, at the &s;ame time, to pre&s;erve a number of innocent cere|monies, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;implicity of the Chri&s;tian religion, and &s;ufficient to maintain the decency and order nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in public wor&s;hip.&mdash; The two guides, which they followed in compiling the Engli&s;h liturgy, were, the pure religion taught in
<PB N="93" REF="96">&s;cripture, and the u&s;ages of the primitive church: and it &s;eems to have been their chief view, to make the wor&s;hip of the church of England &s;uch, as all Chri&s;|tians upon earth might lawfully join in, whil&s;t it af|forded all the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;alvation to her own members. All acts of communion are &s;o many exer|ci&s;es of union: and, as they judged an unity of com|munion nece&s;&s;ary to the unity of the Catholic church, they were likewi&s;e &s;en&s;ible of this truth, that whatever church, whether dioce&s;an, provincial or national, how widely &s;oever extended over &s;everal nations, or con|tracted within the bounds of one particular country, doth, by introducing unlawful terms of communion, unlawful prayers or practices, into her con&s;tant wor|&s;hip, render communion with her&s;elf impracticable, &s;he doth, at the &s;ame time, de&s;troy the unity of com|munion, and cut off her&s;elf from the body of the Catholic church. This may be termed a <HI>moral</HI> &s;epa|ration from the church of Chri&s;t: and takes place whether it be followed by a <HI>local</HI> one or not, it being incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty of a good Chri&s;tian to join in unlawful petitions or practices, or to communicate with a body of men, how numerous &s;oever, a part of who&s;e con&s;tant wor&s;hip is unlawful. Actual commu|nion can only be exerci&s;ed with the particular churches, within who&s;e bounds or neighbourhood we either live or &s;ojourn: but it is nece&s;&s;ary for every particular church to be in a &s;tate of communion with all the Chri&s;tian world; which &s;he cannot be if &s;he vitiates her con&s;tant wor&s;hip by unlawful prayers or practices, and thus hinders all &s;incere Chri&s;tians from joining in her wor&s;hip. From the&s;e principles it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, why the committee, in drawing up the liturgy, left out the practices of adoring, as well the wood of the cro&s;s, as the ho&s;t in the form of a wafer, and the prayers either directly addre&s;&s;ed to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, St. Nicholas, and other &s;aints, or &s;uing for the par|don of &s;ins, the benefit of the &s;acraments, and eternal

Solitary ma&s;&s;es were aboli&s;hed; the communion in the &s;acrament, and the admini&s;tration thereof in both kinds, were re&s;tored, according to the in&s;titution of our Saviour, and the practice of the primitive church, that the people might not be deprived of any means of grace, or condition of &s;alvation, offered to them under the go&s;pel oeconomy. That they might not be diverted from having recour&s;e to tho&s;e means; or from a care of working out their &s;alvation with a religious fear, by human inventions, and a groundle&s;s notion of their being attended with &s;alutary and &s;upernatural effects, all exorci&s;ms and be|nedictions of &s;alt and water, fire, coals, candles, bran|ches of trees, bells<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 234 &amp; &s;eq. of vol. i. of this work.</NOTE>, and the like inanimate &s;ub|&s;tances, and other &s;uper&s;titious u&s;ages, deba&s;ing the dignity of religion, and incon&s;i&s;tent with that beauty of holine&s;s, in which God is to be wor&s;hipped, were laid a&s;ide<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>

The bill for allowing the marriage of the clergy, which had been fru&s;trated by the prorogation of the parliament, December 24, 1547, being now revived, it was en|acted, "that all po&s;itive laws, canons, con&s;titutions, and ordinances, formerly made, and prohibiting mar|riage to any eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;piritual per&s;on, of what degree &s;oever, &s;hould be utterly void, and of none ef|fect; and that all manner of forfeitures, penalties, crimes, or actions, in con&s;equence of &s;uch laws, &s;hould be likewi&s;e void, as well with regard to the marriages already made, as tho&s;e that hereafter &s;hould be made, by &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons." When this bill pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of Lords, &s;even Bi&s;hops, with the Lords Morley, Dacres, Wind&s;or, and Wharton, entered their di&s;&s;ent. The act enjoining <HI>ab&s;tinence</HI> from fle&s;h in Lent, and on Fridays, Satudays, ember-days, vigils, and other u&s;ual fi&s;h or fa&s;ting days, not abrogated, pa&s;|&s;ed unanimou&s;ly: and that for vacating all fraudulent and extorted &s;ales of the pen&s;ions, granted to prie&s;ts on the di&s;&s;olution of convents and chantries, and re|&s;toring them to the rightful proprietors upon refunding the incon&s;iderable purcha&s;e-money, &s;eems to have met with no oppo&s;ition. The beneficed clergy &s;uffered great hard&s;hips at this time; abundance of patrons &s;eizing the revenues of churches for their own u&s;e, or potting in the religious (who had pen&s;ions out of the abbey-lands which they had purcha&s;ed) to &s;erve the cures; the people in general refu&s;ing to pay <HI>tythes,</HI> either out of a di&s;like of the incumbent, or becau&s;e they found that the patrimony of the church might, in &s;o un&s;ettled a time, be &s;ecurely invaded<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The lo&s;s which the clergy &s;u&s;tained by their rights and the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical laws, which &s;hould have &s;ecured them, lying dormant for years together, was the greater, by its happening at a time when the rents of lands were ri&s;ing continually upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of abbeys, and the yearly flows of gold and &s;ilver from America, &s;o that incum|bents were glad to take what they could get from the Lords and landholders in their pari&s;hes; not daring to demand more, le&s;t they &s;hould lo&s;e all. This gave occa&s;ion to a multitude of compo&s;itions for tythes; which, if continued at the &s;ame rate for the time of &s;e|veral incumbents, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, even of one, if long-lived, and non-re&s;ident, &s;erve for a pretence to country juries to fix them for ever, under the notion of a <HI>modus.</HI> The malevolence of lawyers, a variation in the maxims of law, and the want of &s;ettled rules for evidence, have contributed much to this grievance. The mi&s;taken names given by country people of late to &s;ome parcels of land, have been the occa&s;ion perhaps of a hundred churches lo&s;ing their rights &s;ince the Revolution. When churches were built, and pari&s;hes an|nexed to them, they were endowed by the Bi&s;hop's giving the gre$t and &s;mall tythes of the di&s;trict to the Rector of the church, and by the Lord of the manor's giving a man&s;e and glebe. This glebe was a&s;&s;igned in &s;mall doles or pieces, taken from the lands occupied by each of his tenants, and the&s;e lie di&s;per&s;ed in the common fields or meadows, till they come, upon an enclo&s;ure, to be laid together, for the common convenience of the Rector and his pari&s;hioners. The&s;e &s;mall portions of glebe, are, in old terriers, called <HI>doles,</HI> or pieces; but, within this l$&s;t century, the common people have got an habit of calling, &s;uch as lie in meadow ground, <HI>tythe pieces;</HI> and from hence pretend, that they were given in lieu of tythe hay, either of the meadows wherein they lie, or of the whole pari&s;h: though it is p$ain, no part of the glebe given by a Lord of the manor, could be a compo&s;ition for any part of the tythes given by the Bi&s;hop. The old terriers before Archbi&s;hop Laud's time, contained only accounts of the glebe; and whoever con&s;ults the&s;e, will find almo&s;t all the pieces, now called tythe pieces, to be there called only pieces, and de&s;cribed as parts of the glebe, with all their re&s;pective boundaries and quantities, &s;o that there can be no room for doubt.</NOTE>. To
<PB N="97" REF="100">provide &s;ome relief for the parochial clergy, an act was now pa&s;&s;ed, enjoining the due payment of tythes, as well predial as per&s;onal: and it was for &s;ome time of great u&s;e with regard to the former, but had little effect as to the latter, the allowance of certain general articles of deduction affording room for cavils, and the exempting per&s;ons from being examined upon oath, as to their gains, rendering it impracticable to di&s;cover and fix the dues of the clergy, &s;o that in large market-towns, where there are &s;carce any predial

<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Lord Sudley attainted and beheaded.</NOTE> Thomas Lord Sudley had, in the be|ginning of the year, renewed his intrigues again&s;t his brother the Lord Protector, by forming confederacies with &s;uch noble|men as envied the Protector's greatne&s;s; arraigning the Protector's conduct, and charging him with a de|&s;ign of en&s;laving the nation, by the help of 3000 Ger|man &s;oldiers, who had been taken into pay, and brought over to &s;erve again&s;t Scotland. He per|&s;uaded the noblemen to retire home, and make them|&s;elves &s;trong in their countries; and courted the yeomen, and &s;uch as were ringleaders in counties, and retained abundance of the&s;e, as well as of young gentlemen, in his &s;ervice. In con&s;equence of the&s;e mea&s;ures, he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of rai&s;ing 10,000 men, at any time, be&s;ides his particular friends: and, having laid in magazines of arms for them (particularly in the ca&s;tle of Holt, in Denbigh&s;hire) had found means to &s;ecure 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a month for their pay, by a combina|tion with Sir W. Sharington, Vice-trea&s;urer of the mint at Bri&s;tol. Sharington had defrauded the King above 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in clippings and &s;hearings; and to make up the &s;um in his accounts, he had made the coin the lighter, and had coined a va&s;t quantity of te&s;tons, of a ba&s;e alloy, and under &s;tandard, without any warrant, and contrary to expre&s;s orders. What he gained in this manner is computed to amount to 40,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Thus &s;upplied with money, the Admiral grew confi|dent of &s;ucce&s;s; but wanted to be &s;ure of another point, which, tho' no way &s;erviceable to the getting the King in his hands, was perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to his further de|&s;igns. The Queen dowager having died, in Septem|ber 1548, in childbed, he renewed his addre&s;&s;es to the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, not without &s;ome hopes of their being accepted. Mo&s;t of the&s;e proceedings were known; and the Protector had often warned him of
<PB N="99" REF="102">the danger he ran, endeavouring to di&s;&s;uade him by gentle means from pur&s;uing them: but he was incor|rigible, and, when he could no longer excu&s;e his mea|&s;ures, thought to bear him&s;elf our with in&s;olence. No other method &s;ucceeding, it was re&s;olved at la&s;t to &s;end him and Sharington to the Tower: and the latter be|ing tried, on February 4, at Guildhall, confe&s;&s;ed his crimes, and was found guilty of high trea&s;on, but af|terwards pardoned. The Protector &s;till endeavoured to bring the Admiral to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; offering to &s;top all proceedings, if he would retire from court, and all public bu&s;ine&s;s: but nothing could cure his ambitious turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, or moderate his hatred to his brother. This &s;tubborne&s;s proved fatal to him&punc; On February 25, a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of Lords for his attainder; the King's council, and all the judges, having delivered their opinions, that &s;e|veral of the articles, charged again&s;t him, were trea|&s;on. The evidence for the bill being examined, it was agreed to unanimou&s;ly; only the Protector, for natu|ral pity's &s;ake (&s;uch is the expre&s;&s;ion in the council books) de&s;ired leave to withdraw. The bill was read the third time, on the 27th, and &s;ent down to the Commons, with a me&s;&s;age, that, if they intended to follow the method taken in the upper hou&s;e, the Lords, who had given their evidence there, &s;hould be &s;ent to them, and declare, by word of mouth, before them &s;uch matters, as they might, in the mean time, &s;ee in their written depo&s;itions.

Some began, even at Ea&s;ter, to officiate by it; and others followed their example, as fa&s;t as books could be provided: and, on Whit&s;unday, the day appointed by the act, it was read, with great &s;o|lemnity, in St. Paul's cathedral, at London, for an example to the churches of that city, and all over the kingdom.

A peremptory order be|ing &s;ent for their attendance, &s;he wrote word to the council in another letter, dated June 27, "That &s;he was &s;ubject to none of them, and would obey no laws they made, though &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf &s;ubject to the King." This occa&s;ioned a charge being given to her officers, who obeyed the &s;ummons, to repre&s;ent to her, "That, tho' the King was young, his authority was, by the law of England, as great, as if he was of full age; that though, as &s;ingle per&s;ons, they were her humble &s;ervants, yet, when they were a&s;&s;embled in a council, they acted in the King's name, and were to be equally re&s;pected in the exerci&s;e of his authority; that the late King's laws were no longer in force, others being made in their &s;tead; and that, as all the King's &s;ubjects were included in the laws, without exception, &s;he ought to &s;et a good example."

Mr. Hales, one of the late commi&s;&s;ioners for enquiring into inclo&s;ures, had ob&s;erved every where the oppre&s;|&s;ion of the poor country people; and, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, had endeavoured to procure them &s;ome relief, by three different bills which he had brought into parlia|ment: but, the intent of them appearing to tho&s;e that were intere&s;ted in the inclo&s;ures, they were all rejected by either the Lords or Commons. The King, who (as appears from one of his di&s;cour&s;es) laid this matter to heart, in order to pacify the poor people, till be could more effectually redre&s;s their grievances, i&s;&s;ued new commi&s;&s;ions for enquiring into inclo&s;ures; and publi&s;hed a proclamation, in the beginning of May, enjoining all who had inclo&s;ed any lands, that u&s;ed to be common, under certain penalties, to lay them open
<PB N="104" REF="109">again, by a day a&s;&s;igned. Whether this encouraged the populace to think they &s;hould be warranted in their proceedings, or whether they were apprehen&s;ive it would be eluded, and have as little effect as former proclamations, and even &s;tatutes, on the &s;ame account, they did not wait for the day fixed by it, but, ri&s;ing in many parts of the realm in a riotous manner, pulled down the poles of parks, levelled banks, filled up ditches, and de&s;troyed the hedges of inclo&s;ures. One of the&s;e ri&s;ings, in Wilt&s;hire, was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Sir W. Herbert; as tho&s;e, in the adjacent counties of Glouce&s;ter and Oxford, were by the Lord Grey of Wilton, with the &s;laughter of a good many of the rioters. Tho&s;e in Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, Hamp&s;hire, and &s;ome midland counties, were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by gentler means; the nobility and gentry per&s;uading the rioters to di&s;|per&s;e: but in Devon&s;hire and Norfolk the commo|tions were much more con&s;iderable and dangerous.&mdash;</P>
<P>That in <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> began upon the common pre|tence of inclo&s;ures, and might as ea&s;ily have been quelled, as any of the others, in which no body of figure had as yet appeared, if the in&s;urgents had not been tampered with to change their note, and &s;et up for the Romi&s;h religion. It was about Whit&s;unday (which fell this year on June 9) that the pari&s;h prie&s;t of Sampford Courtenay, grieving at the abolition of the ma&s;s, and the lo&s;s of his former gains by &s;olitary ones, drew together a party of his pari&s;hioners, and, with &s;ome other confederates, per&s;uaded the country people to take up arms, in hopes of increa|&s;ing their numbers, and drawing in the gentry to e&s;|peu&s;e their quarrel. Nor were they deceived in their expectations; Humphrey Arundel, governor of St. Michael's Mount, and &s;ome other gentlemen, putting them&s;elves at their head, their number &s;oon amount|ing to 10,000 men, united under expert commanders. It was expected at court, that this might be as ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed as other ri&s;ings: and the Lord Protector,
<PB N="105" REF="110">being aver&s;e to extremities, &s;ent only the Lord Ru&s;&s;el with a &s;mall force to &s;top their proceedings. This nobleman, too weak to encounter them in the open field, treated with them at a di&s;tance; hoping for the &s;ame &s;ucee&s;s in this method, as the Duke of Norfolk, in the late reign, had met with, in di&s;uniting the York&s;hire rebels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 462 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>: and, encouraging them to make their complaints, offered to &s;end them to the council. Their demands were, "that the new liturgy &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, and the old &s;ervice with the Latin ma&s;s, images, holy water, bread, and all other u&s;ual cere|remonies, be re&s;tored; that the &s;acrament &s;hould be given only to the people at Ea&s;ter, and in one kind; that it &s;hould be hung up, and wor&s;hipped, and all that refu&s;ed to wor&s;hip it &s;hould &s;uffer as heretics; that &s;olitary ma&s;&s;es &s;hould be re&s;tored, and all preach|ers in their &s;ermons, and prie&s;ts in the ma&s;s, &s;hould pray for &s;ouls in purgatory; that the Engli&s;h Bible &s;hould be called in, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e the clergy could not ea&s;ily confound heretics; that the act of the &s;ix articles &s;hould be revived, and Cardinal Pole be re|&s;tored and made of the King's council; and that half of the abbey and church lands be re&s;umed, and given to two of the chief abbeys in each county; and that their particular grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed in the manner which Mr. Arundel and the Mayors of Bod|min &s;hould be &s;ent, upon receipt of a &s;afe-conduct, to repre&s;ent." Their demands, which had been put into their heads by &s;editious prie&s;ts, were rejected as in&s;o|lent: and an an&s;wer was drawn to each particular. In that, to the demand concerning the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, it was &s;aid, "that they would not have been carried in parliament, if the late King had not gone thither in per&s;on, and procured the act; though afterwards of his own accord he &s;lackened the execu|tion of it." As to the new liturgy, to which they had
<PB N="106" REF="111">declared an aver&s;ion, before they had either known or con&s;idered it, they were told, "it had been drawn up, after great &s;tudy, and long con&s;ultation, by <HI>all the learned clergy,</HI> in reforming the old offices; and the wor&s;hip of the church was now brought as near to what Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles had taught or done, as could be; it had been devi&s;ed by the Bi&s;hops of the realm, had been agreed to by the whole clergy (in their provincial &s;ynods or convocation) e&s;tabli&s;hed by parliament, and (being agreeable to &s;cripture) was con|firmed by the word of God him&s;elf."&mdash;A &s;afe-conduct being refu&s;ed to the ringleaders, who were treated as notorious traitors, and an an&s;wer &s;hewing the unrea|&s;onablene&s;s of every thing they demanded, could not be plea&s;ing to the in&s;urgents: however, they thought fit to moderate their demands, rather than put an end to the treaty. The ma&s;s, and the &s;ix articles, were now the chief matters in&s;i&s;ted on; and the&s;e were rejected in the an&s;wer made, on July 8, in the King's name; who&s;e minority being the mo&s;t &s;pecious thing that mi&s;led them, it was repre&s;ented to them, "that his blood, and not his years, gave him the crown, and the &s;tate of government required, that there &s;hould be, at all times, the &s;ame authority in Princes, and the &s;ame obedience in &s;ubjects." It was penned in a threaten|ing &s;tile, and concluded with ah$invitation of them to &s;ubmit to the King's mercy, which the other in&s;ur|gents had experienced, and found withal a redre&s;s of their grievances: otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t expect the ut|mo&s;t &s;everity that traitors de&s;erved. The rebels, tru&s;ting to their numbers, were in no di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit; and marched to Exeter, carrying before them the <HI>pix</HI> or <HI>ho&s;te,</HI> born under a canopy, with cro&s;&s;es, banners, holy water and bread, candle&s;ticks, and other things which had been removed out of churches for being abu&s;ed to &s;uper&s;tition. They laid &s;iege to the town, and made &s;everal attempts to &s;torm it, but in vain. Lord Ru&s;&s;el, who had lain all this time at
<PB N="107" REF="112">Honiton, being joined by 300 Italian arquebu&s;iers under Batti&s;ta Spinola, by the Lord Grey with &s;everal troops of German hor&s;e, and other forces, re&s;olved to attampt the relief of Exeter, which was now redu|ced to extremity for want of provi&s;ions, the inhabi|tants having been obliged to eat their hor&s;es. He attacked them, and driving them from their works, with a great &s;laughter of their men, entered the city on Augu&s;t 6, being received in a triumphant manner by the citizens, who&s;e loyalty was rewarded by an increa&s;e of privileges, and a grant of the manor of Eviland to the corporation. The rebels, retiring in &s;cattered parties, were pur&s;ued and cut off in great numbers; their &s;tronge&s;t body, having rendezvouzed at Launce&s;ton, were routed, and their chiefs taken. Arundel, the mayor of Bodmin, and the re&s;t of the ringleaders, were &s;ent to London, and executed; &s;everal of the rabble were put to death by martial law, for a terror to others; and the vicar of Saint Thomas, one of the principal incendiaries, was hanged on the top of his own tower, dre&s;&s;ed in his Popi&s;h garb, with his beads hanging at his girdle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Norfolk</HI> in&s;urrection began at Ailborough June 20, and grew nothing con&s;iderable, till July 6, when Robert Ket a tanner, but rich, being owner of three manors, put him&s;elf at their head, and a&s;&s;umed the &s;tyles of ma&s;ter and King of Norfolk and Suffolk. He confined in irons all &s;uch as refu&s;ed to follow his camp; and was &s;upported by one Coniers, an eccle&s;ia&s;|tic, who officiated as chaplain. They broke down in|clo&s;ures, ravaged the country, and denounced ven|geance again&s;t the gentlemen of that county. The pretence of their ri&s;ing at fir&s;t only related to inclo&s;ures: but, when their number increa&s;ed to 20,000, nothing would &s;erve them but the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the gentry, placing of new coun&s;ellors about the King, and &s;ome|what to be done in favour of the old religion.

They rejected the offer with di&s;dain, and e&s;tabli&s;hed their head-quar|ters at Mun&s;hold, where Ket the tanner, and a com|mittee, &s;at in judgment under a large tree, known by the appellation of <HI>the oak reformation,</HI> from which Dr. Matthew Parker preached to the rebels of their duty and allegiance, to the no &s;mall hazard of his life from divers arrows &s;not at him. They made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Norwich, and obliged Thomas Cod the Mayor to attend them, though at length they admitted him, and other gentlemen pri&s;oners, to their councils, for the greater credit thereof. William Parr, Marquis of Northampton, was &s;ent again&s;t them, and took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Norwich, which had been evacuated by the in|&s;urgents. The&s;e, a&s;&s;aulting the Marquis there in the night, were repul&s;ed with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s; but re|newed the attack with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they en|tered the city, and compelled Northampton to retreat, with the lo&s;s of one $$dred men &s;lain, among whom was John Lord S$$$$d, and about thirty taken pri|&s;oners: for the citizens in general favoured the rebels, and annoyed the King's troops with &s;tones from the windows and balconies, while they were engaged with the in&s;urgents in the &s;treets. Upon this di&s;a&s;ter, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, was &s;ent with a numerous reinforcement, and a large train of artillery. When he came before Norwich, he &s;ummoned the rebels to &s;urrender, a&s;&s;uring them of the benefit of a free par|don: but his propo&s;al being rejected, he planted his artillery, and having made a breach, entered the city by a&s;&s;ault. One hundred and thirty of the in&s;urgents were killed in the encounter, and &s;ixty, being taken, were immediately hanged by martial law: however &s;ome of Warwick's waggons falling into the hands of the rebels, they got a &s;upply of ammunition, which they began to want. Their rage was increa&s;ed at the
<PB N="119" REF="116">&s;ight of the execution of their a&s;&s;ociates. They poured in like a torrent at one of the gates, though it was guarded with cannon, and, notwith&s;tanding a very ob|&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, carried off the artillery. On this occa&s;ion the very boys &s;hewed a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;pirit, pull|ing the arrows from their bodies, and delivering them to their own archers. The in&s;urgents, animated by this &s;ucce&s;s, battered the wall, and then mounting the breach, were with great difficulty drove back.

His lord&s;hip being reinforced with 1500 hor&s;e, &s;ent them another offer of pardon, but with an exception of &s;ome of their ringleaders. The rebels refu&s;ing it on the&s;e terms, Warwick ordered the whole cavalry into the valley, where they were formed in tolerable good order, and had placed their pri&s;oners in the front tied together in pairs, that they might &s;tand the fir&s;t brunt of the battle. The roya|li&s;ts, however, &s;pared the unfortunate captives, and attacked their antagoni&s;ts with &s;uch vigour, that they quickly put them in di&s;order, and made them fly with precipitation. The pur&s;uit was continued for three miles, with &s;uch carnage, that 2000 lay dead upon the ground.

<P>It was greatly &s;u&s;pected, that the Lady Mary, then re&s;iding at Kenninghall in Suffolk, had given encou|ragement to the Norfolk rebellion: Pooley and Lionel, her &s;ervants, were &s;aid to have been concerned with them: but &s;he vindicated her&s;elf very well from all &s;u&s;picions, and the informations appeared to be groundle&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Bonner Bi|&s;hop of Lon|don deprived and impri|&s;oned.</NOTE> The council now had lei&s;ure to look after the execution of the act of uniformity, from which they had been diverted by the&s;e commotions, and to take mea&s;ures for preventing &s;everal Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops, who had officiated openly by the new liturgy, to avoid the penalty, from celebrating their private ma&s;&s;es in &s;ecret places, where it was difficult to di&s;cover their practices. This was done no where with &s;uch a&s;&s;urance, as in the cathedral of St. Paul; in &s;everal chapels whereof, by the &s;ufferance of Edmund Bonner, the Bi&s;hop, ma&s;&s;es were &s;till kept up, particularly tho&s;e of the Apo&s;tles and our Lady's performed in Latin, di&s;gui&s;ed under the Engli&s;h names of <HI>the Apo&s;tles,</HI> and <HI>our Lady's communion.</HI> The council had, by their letters of June 24, ordered Bonner not to &s;uffer &s;uch ma&s;&s;es to be u&s;ed, or the holy communion to be admini&s;tered, in any other place than at the high altar of the church, or at any other time than that when high ma&s;s u&s;ed to be &s;aid formerly. Bonner, not willing him&s;elf to execute the&s;e injunctions, left it to the Dean and Chapter: and, the practice &s;till continuing, he was
<PB N="111" REF="120">accu&s;ed of negligence, and &s;ummoned to appear, on Augu&s;t 11, before the council. He had there a wri|ting delivered to him in &s;upport of the charge of re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s, repre&s;enting, that whereas on high fe&s;ti|vals he had u&s;ed formerly to officiate him&s;elf, he had &s;eldom or never done &s;o, &s;ince the introduction of the new liturgy. Certain injunctions were given him, to be ob&s;erved in his future conduct, and requiring him particularly to preach at St. Paul's cro&s;s once a quar|ter, to be pre&s;ent there at every &s;ermon, unle&s;s he were &s;ick, to officiate in his cathedral on every high fe&s;tival, and give the communion, to pro&s;ecute all that either went to ma&s;s, or did not frequent the common prayer, and receive the &s;acrament once a year. For a trial of his loyalty, he was ordered to preach at St. Paul's cro&s;s, on Sunday, September 1, again&s;t the rebels, and to &s;hew as well the unlawfulne&s;s of taking up arms on pretence of religion, as that the King was as much a King, and the people as much bound to obey him, whil&s;t a minor, as when he was of full age to take upon him&s;elf the exerci&s;e of government. When the day came he &s;pent mo&s;t of his &s;ermon in maintaining tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, with many bitter reflec|tions on all that were of a different opinion, and &s;e|veral other things tending to &s;tir up di&s;order and di&s;|&s;ention: but mentioned nothing concerning the King's authority, whil&s;t a monor, which, being nece&s;&s;ary for refuting the chief pretence, as well of the rebels for their in&s;urrections, as of others for their non-confor|mity, had been mo&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted upon by the council. This being complained of by Dr. William Latimer and John Hooper, a commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued, on Sep|tember 8, to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, Nicholas Ridley Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, Sir W. Petre, and Sir T. Smith, &s;ecietaries of State, and Dr. W. May Dean of St. Paul's, to examine him upon the information given again&s;t him, and &s;ummarily to proceed to eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="112" REF="121">cen&s;ures, to impri&s;onment and deprivation, as the offence &s;hould be found to de&s;erve. Bonner, when convened before them, pretended he could not &s;ee his judges, until they were pointed out to him by one of the bye-&s;tanders. When the witne&s;&s;es were examined, he &s;aid one talked like a goo&s;e, and another like a woodcock. He treated the court with contempt, and laughed at the people, calling them fools and dunces. He affirmed, that Dr. Hooper was an a&s;s indeed; and told Secretary Smith, that he was a liar. Archbi&s;hop Cranmer telling him, that he ought to be &s;ent to pri&s;on for his in&s;olence, he replied, that he cared not whi|ther they &s;ent him, &s;o as they did not &s;end him to the devil; but thither he &s;aid he would not go. He &s;aid, he had a few goods, a poor carca&s;e, and a &s;oul; that the two former were in their power, but the la&s;t was in his own. The court was &s;everal times adjourned: but he continuing to revile his judges in the mo&s;t abu|&s;ive terms, was committed to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, after having appealed to the King. Whil&s;t in that pri&s;on, he was a&s;&s;ured of gentle u&s;age, if he would &s;ubmit, and promi&s;e better behaviour for the future: but he &s;eems to have taken his party, and, in&s;i&s;ting on his appeal to the King, which was either not received, or he could not obtain a &s;uper&s;edeas upon it, refu&s;ed to make any other an&s;wer. He had taken out a com|mi&s;&s;ion to hold his &s;ee of London, during the King's plea&s;ure; and the Commi&s;&s;ioners, though unwilling to proceed to extremities, &s;eeing him ob&s;tinate and in|corrigible, &s;entenced him to be deprived of his &s;ee, and to remain in pri&s;on till the King &s;hould order other|wi&s;e. This method of procedure again&s;t Bonner, and the exemplary puni&s;hment of the late rebels, being followed by an act in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, for the de&s;troying of all images, and the calling in of all the old offices, kept the Romani&s;ts in tolerable order during the remainder of Edward's reign.</P>

<P>The mea&s;ures, which the Protector had taken to promote the reformation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Protector accu&s;ed of mal|admini&s;tration, &s;ent to the Tower, and relea&s;ea.</NOTE> had made all the Popi&s;h party his enemies: and having too precipitately rai&s;ed an im|men&s;e fortune, gave too much occa&s;ion for a clamour again&s;t his conduct. Be&s;ides the deanery of Wells, with five other dignities or prebends, which Henry VIII. had promi&s;ed him, and the church-lands be&s;towed upon him, by Edward VI. as a reward for his &s;ucce&s;s in Scotland, he had procured a great many other beneficial grants to him&s;elf, to the impairing of the King's revenue. He had recommended his &s;er|vants to the like bounties, and had been &s;o partial to his own creatures in the di&s;tribution of the chantry lands, that a very &s;mall portion of them was granted to &s;uch noblemen as he viewed in an unfavourable light. The pro&s;ecution of his brother, (in which he was &s;up|po&s;ed to act by Warwick's in&s;tigation) and the &s;igning of the warrant for his execution, appeared in the world's eye &s;uch unnatural acts, that they greatly ble|mi&s;hed his character. The parade he &s;hewed of his wealth, in erecting that &s;umptuous palace called <HI>So|mer&s;et hou&s;e,</HI> and the havock he made of the &s;acred buildings on that occa&s;ion gave univer&s;al offence. We&s;t|min&s;ter-abbey was fir&s;t propo&s;ed for the &s;cite of his palace; but he was diverted from that de&s;ign, by the Dean and Chapter conveying to him the rich manor of I&s;lip, and a great many others, for ninety years. When he had fixed upon <HI>the Strand</HI> for its &s;ituation, St. Mary's pari&s;h church, and the contiguous hou&s;es of the Bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter, Litchfield, and Landaff, were pulled down to furni&s;h ground and materials for the &s;tructure; and there being &s;till deficiency in the latter re&s;pect, a chapel in St. Paul's church-yard, a charnel hou&s;e there, with a chapel in it, and a goodly cloi&s;ter about it, the &s;teeple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, page 20 of this volume.</NOTE> and a part of the church

The tombs and monuments of the dead were defaced, and their bones carried away by cart-loads, and buried in Bloom&s;bury fields: this was &s;hocking to every body, and gave the Londoners a di&s;like to the Protector. Probably his natural compa&s;&s;ion for the poor, and his &s;en&s;e of their hard&s;hips, made him erect a court of re|que&s;ts in his own hou&s;e for their relief, and interpo&s;e with the judges in their behalf: but he carried his re|gard for them to extremity, when he courted their favour, when his conde&s;cen&s;ion to them &s;unk &s;o low as to encourage them to contemn and di&s;obey his commands, when his preference of them was &s;o appa|rent, as to rai&s;e the jealou&s;y and indignation of the nobility. The&s;e la&s;t were enraged, to the highe&s;t de|gree, at the in&s;ults and lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained in the late commotions; imputing the ri&s;e of them to the commi&s;&s;ions and proclamations again&s;t enclo&s;ures i&s;&s;ued by his authority or influence, and the not &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them in the bud to his dilatory proceedings, and de|clining to march again&s;t them in per&s;on at the head of an army. Their re&s;entments on the&s;e accounts were now at the height; and the party again&s;t the Protector thought the juncture favourable to their de&s;ign.&mdash; After &s;everal complaints, di&s;putes, and treaties for an accommodation, the Lord St. John, Pre&s;ident, the Earls of Warwick, Arundel, and Southampton, Sir E. North, Sir Richard Southwell, Sir Edward Peckham, Sir E.

Cheyne, Sir John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Montague: and wrote the King a letter full of pro|fe&s;&s;ions of their duty, pretences of zeal for his pre&s;er|vation, and complaints again&s;t the Duke of Somer&s;et, whom they charged with gathering a force about him, to maintain his wilful mea&s;ures. This charge was founded on his behaviour at Hampton court, upon advice of what was doing at Ely-hou&s;e; having cau&s;ed a proclamation to be made at the court-gates, and in other parts of the neigbourhood, requiring all per&s;ons to come in for the defence of the King; whom he re|moved thence that night to Wind&s;or ca&s;tle, with his guards, and the retinues of &s;uch as were then at court, making in all about 500 men. The Lords at Lon|don went to Guildhall, October 8, and, giving the common council of the city an account of their pro|ceedings, a&s;&s;ured them, they had no thoughts of alter|ing religion, as was reported by their enemies, and no views but for the &s;afety of the King, the honour of the kingdom, and the good of the people; for which ends they de&s;ired their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The common coun|cil unanimiou&s;ly approved of their conduct, and pro|mi&s;ed to &s;tand by them with their lives and fortunes. This declaration of theirs, and the commons not com|ing in as he expected to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o intimidated the Protector, that he re&s;olved to &s;truggle no longer again&s;t the &s;tream: and, prote&s;ting that his de&s;ign in collecting forces was only to guard his per&s;on from any violent attack, declared him&s;elf ready to &s;ubmit to what two of the Lords at London, and two of tho&s;e about the King, &s;hould determine; de&s;iring, however, that what was agreed on, &s;hould be confirmed in par|liament. A warrant was &s;ent for the two Lords to repair to Wind&s;or, with the King's faith for their &s;afe|ty: and Cranmer, Paget, and Smith (all the coun|&s;ellors
<PB N="116" REF="125">now remaining with him) wrote to them, re|commending a peaceable determination of the matter, and exhorting them not to be led by cruel councils, which they well knew &s;ome were &s;ugge&s;ting; glancing at the Earl of Southampton, who had not yet dige&s;ted the di&s;grace brought on him by the Duke of Somer|&s;et.&mdash; The Lords Ru&s;&s;el and Wentworth, Sir Ant. Brown, Sir Ant. Wingfield, and Sir John Baker Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, having de&s;erted the Duke of Somer&s;et in his di&s;tre&s;s, and joined the a&s;&s;ociate coun&s;ellors at London, it was agreed that So|mer&s;et was no longer fit to be Protector. Sir Philip Hobby was &s;ent back with letters to the King, de&s;iring they might be admitted to his pre&s;ence; that the forces gathered about his per&s;on might be &s;ent away; and that the Duke of Somer&s;et might &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the order of council. Their de&s;ires were complied with: and the Lords, being invited to &s;end three per&s;ons to Wind&s;or, for ordering things according to their minds, &s;ent them, with a charge not to allow the Duke of Somer&s;et to withdraw before their arrival. On October 12, the whole council came to Wind&s;or, prote&s;ting to the King, that all they had done was for his &s;afety and &s;ervice. On the day following, the Protector, being called before them, was charged with &s;everal mi&s;demeanors, "in acting without the con&s;ent of the other executors; in treating alone with foreign amba&s;&s;adors; in making Bi&s;hops and Lord Lieutenants by his own authority; in holding a court of reque&s;ts in his own hou&s;e, and determining matters relating to freeholds; in emba&s;ing the coin; in i&s;&s;uing procla|mations and commi&s;&s;ions about inclo&s;ures, contrary to the &s;entiments of the re&s;t of the council; in not taking care to &s;uppre&s;s the late in&s;urrections, in ne|glecting the forts about Boulogne; in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the King with ill notions of the de&s;igns of the Lords, who met at London, and cau&s;ing them to be proclaimed as traitors; in arming his &s;ervants, gathering people,
<PB N="117" REF="126">carrying the King to Wind&s;or &s;o &s;uddenly, as to put him in fear, and threw him into a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e." In con&s;equence of this charge, he was &s;ent to the Tower, and the King was carried back the &s;ame day to Hampton Court; the Marquis of Northampton, the Earls of Warwick and Southampton, the Lords St. John, Ru&s;&s;el, and Wentworth, being appointed gover|nors of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus matters &s;tood, when the parliament met on No|vember 4, after which a bill of attainder was brought into the hou&s;e of Peers again&s;t the Duke of Somer&s;et, founded upon a confe&s;&s;ion &s;igned with his own hand. A deputation of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly was &s;ent to learn from his own mouth, whether this confe&s;&s;ion was vo|luntary or extorted. He thanked them for their can|dour; owned that he had voluntarily &s;igned the writing; but &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that he had never harboured a &s;ini&s;ter thought again&s;t his Sovereign or the &s;tate. Upon this he was dive&s;ted of all his offices; and all his moveables, together with great part of his landed e&s;tate, were confi&s;cated, for the u&s;e of the King; but his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behaviour, and the frivolou&s;|ne&s;s of the charge again&s;t him, &s;o far blunted the ma|lice of Warwick and his other enemies, that the pro|&s;ecution was dropped, and him&s;elf relea&s;ed from his confinement, after giving &s;ecurity for his future con|duct, and, in two months after his enlargement, re|admitted to a &s;eat at the council table.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the parliament pa&s;&s;ed a &s;evere law again&s;t unlawful a&s;&s;emblies,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Acts in fa|vour of the Reformation.</NOTE> in order to prevent future in&s;urrections; and repealed the &s;tatute again&s;t vaga|bonds, which had pa&s;&s;ed in the parliament that met in November 1547, and was enacted chiefly again&s;t the religious of di&s;&s;olved mona&s;teries. The new liturgy was confirmed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion; and all the <HI>old offices, mi&s;&s;als,</HI> and <HI>breviaries,</HI> with other books deemed &s;u|per&s;titious, were ordered to be delivered to certain com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
<PB N="118" REF="127">that they might be burned and de&s;troyed. It was enacted, that all the prayers addre&s;&s;ed to &s;aints &s;hould be razed out of the books printed in the late reign; and that all images taken from churches &s;hould, within a limited time, be committed to the flames. The&s;e laws prevented all further oppo&s;ition, from the Romi&s;h party, to the new liturgy, during this King's reign, as the want of &s;ervice-books rendered their prie&s;ts incapable to officiate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was in this &s;e&s;&s;ion that the &s;ons of Pe$$s fir&s;t obtained liberty to &s;it in the hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The friends of Popery, expecting that the Earl of Southampton would now have the reins of govern|ment, were much elated at the fall of Somer&s;et: but they &s;oon found that the Earl of Warwick had the a&s;cendancy. They were not de&s;titute of hopes from this nobleman, who was generally believed to have given them great hopes and a&s;&s;urances of what he would do in their favour: but, when he found the King immoveable in that point, and &s;o much bent upon the reformation, that nothing could &s;o much recom|mend a per&s;on to his favour, as endeavouring to pro|mote it, he ea&s;ily dropped that party, and affected to be zealous in advancing what he found was &s;o agree|able to his Sovereign. Bonner petitioning that his appeal might be received, and his proce&s;s reviewed, a new court of delegates, con&s;i&s;ting of four civilians, and the like number of common lawyers, was appoint|ed for that purpo&s;e: but, upon examining the mat|ter, they reported, that the proce&s;s had been legally carried on, and the &s;entence ju&s;tly given.</P>
<P>There &s;till were wanting, to compleat the offices of the church of England,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A newordinal e&s;tabli&s;hed.</NOTE> forms of prayer for the con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops, and the ordination of prie&s;ts and deacons: and the par|liament pa&s;&s;ed an act for authori&s;ing by law an ordi|nal, to be drawn up by &s;ix Bi&s;hops, and as many learn|ed
<PB N="119" REF="128">divines, of the King's appointment, and publi&s;hed by the next April 1, prohibiting, after that day, the u&s;e of any other. The council already had, at the in|&s;tance of the convocation, &s;et the committee (formerly appointed by that body for reforming the <HI>old offices</HI>) which had drawn up the <HI>new liturgy,</HI> to work upon this ordinal; though, it not being yet compleated, the parliament thought &s;it to give it a legal &s;anction, by a previous confirmation; &s;o implicitly did they pay a deference to the re&s;olutions of the clergy. The or|dinations, mentioned in &s;cripture, were performed by the impo&s;ition of hands, and prayer, and the anciente&s;t forms of ordaining were plain and &s;imple: but latter ages had introduced, in different countries, unctions of the per&s;ons ordained, con&s;ecration of ve&s;tments, and abundance of other rites and ceremonies, which, being unknown in the fir&s;t ages of the go&s;pel, the committee thought fit to retrench; and to &s;ollow the rules of the primitive church, as recapitulated in the fourth council of Carthage in 401; which, though compo&s;ed only of African Bi&s;hops, was generally followed, as to the form of con&s;ecrating Bi&s;hops and inferior mini&s;ters, in all the we&s;tern churches. The Romani&s;ts, from the time of the council of Florence, in the fifteenth cen|tury, laid a mighty &s;tre&s;s upon the rite of delivering to a prie&s;t the ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed in the con&s;ecration of the euchari&s;t, with a power of &s;acrificing to God for the dead and the living; a form introduced to countenance &s;olitary ma&s;&s;es, and the notion, which they were wil|ling to encourage, of a new offering up of our Savi|our, di&s;tinct from that on the cro&s;s. When the church in her ordinal hath &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed the holy order, to which a per&s;on is called, and the Bi&s;hops, mini&s;ter|ing in her behalf, have actually, by impo&s;ition of hands, and prayer, conferred upon him that order, though in general terms, he is, in con&s;equence thereof, inve&s;ted with all the powers annexed by Chri&s;t to that order; nor is there any occa&s;ion for an enumeration of every
<PB N="120" REF="129">particular power or branch of his office. There is no nece&s;&s;ary connexion between a prie&s;t and a &s;acrifice: yet the church of England, having empowered &s;uch, as &s;he admits to the order of a prie&s;t or pre&s;byter, to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, has empowered them there|by to offer the euchari&s;tical &s;acrifice. This &s;he thinks as true a &s;acrifice, as the pa&s;&s;over, or any other of the Jewi&s;h &s;acrifices under the law: it is commemorative, as they were typical, of our Saviour's &s;acri&s;ice of him|&s;elf upon the cro&s;s: both are repre&s;entative thereof, though in a different manner, and derive thence their &s;alutary effects. She con&s;iders it as a &s;acrifice really propitiatory, not indeed in its own nature, but in vir|tue of Chri&s;t's in&s;titution, as it is a memorial of his own &s;acrifice upon the cro&s;s, and a means of applying, to each good Chri&s;tian in particular, all the benefits, which he purcha&s;ed by it for the church in general. If her adver&s;aries think fit to repre&s;ent it, as propitia|tory in its own nature, as a new meritorious &s;atisfaction to God for the &s;ins of the living and the dead, as a &s;uppletory &s;acrifice continually &s;upplying the defects of our Saviour's &s;acrifice, or as a new immolation of him, or renewal of his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he rejects all the&s;e as fal&s;e and unprimitive notions: and, however they may be in&s;inuated in private to gull the common people, it is not ea&s;y to imagine, that any learned man will dare to maintain them openly and explicitly. The new ordi|nal was publi&s;hed in the March following: and the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop con&s;ecrated by it was John Poynet, promoted to the &s;ee of Roche&s;ter.</P>
<P>A. D. 1550.] In the beginning of this year, a peace being concluded with France and Scot|land,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Gardiner de|frived of his &s;ie of Win|de&s;ter.</NOTE> the council was more at lei&s;ure, and better enabled to remove all ob&s;tructions, that retarded a further reformation. The principal of the&s;e aro&s;e from &s;ome papi&s;ti|cal Bi&s;hops; who, complying with all alterations when made, &s;till kept their &s;ees, and, receiving with
<PB N="121" REF="130">re&s;pect the orders &s;ent them from time to time, took little or no care for their execution; encouraging un|derhand the retaining of many &s;uper&s;titious and abo|li&s;hed practices, to which they were them&s;elves ad|dicted. It was re&s;olved to contrive &s;ome way or bring|ing them within the reach of the law; and, by putting te&s;ts upon them, which they could not ea&s;ily en$$e, oblige them either to declare their di&s;like of what had been lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, or to oppo&s;e the royal autho|rity; acts, which, in the precarious tenure they had of their &s;ees, <HI>during the King's plea&s;ure,</HI> were deemed &s;uf|ficient cau&s;es for their deprivation. Bonner had been already deprived; and Ridley was, on April 1, tran&s;|lated to the &s;ee of London; Middle&s;ex (which had been taken thence, as before related, to farm the dio|ce&s;e of We&s;tmin&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 30 of this volume.</NOTE>) being at the &s;ame time reunited to it, upon Thirlby's re&s;ignation of the latter bi&s;hopric, and removal to Norwich. Gardiner, Bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, had made &s;o ill an u&s;e of the liberty he en|joyed, in con&s;equence of the act of grace, pa&s;&s;ed at the latter end of the year 1547, that he was, in a &s;hort time afterwards, &s;ummoned before the council, and ordered to preach, on June 29, at St. Paul's Cro&s;s, pur&s;uant to the directions given him, by way of pur|gation: deviating from his in&s;tructions in that &s;ermon, he had been put in pri&s;on, where he had continued till this year; when, on June 8, his ca&s;e being con&s;idered in council, it was re&s;olved, "that, if he repented of his former ob&s;tinacy, and would for the future apply him&s;elf to advance the King's proceedings, his pa&s;t errors &s;hould be remitted; otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be pro|&s;ecuted as his ob&s;tinacy and contempt de&s;erved." This re&s;olution being communicated to him next day, he de|&s;ired to &s;ee a book of the King's proceedings; and then, expre&s;&s;ing an inclination to conform, promi&s;ed to give a full and direct an&s;wer, even on &s;ubjects which
<PB N="122" REF="131">might offend his con&s;cience. A book was thereupon &s;ent him; and, Dr. Heylin &s;ays, "that, after peru|&s;ing all the offices contained in the Common-Prayer-book, he declared, that he was very well &s;atisfied in his con&s;cience with it, and would not only execute it in his own per&s;on, but cau&s;e all of his dioce&s;e to officiate by it in divine &s;ervice." As to other proceedings, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from an&s;wering them, unle&s;s he were at liberty. The council, not being &s;atisfied with this, &s;ent &s;ome certain articles to him, on July 8, which he was required to &s;ub&s;cribe. He excepted to none of them, but that which concerned the confe&s;&s;ion of his faults, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he was to make to the King for pardon; which he utterly rejected, in&s;i&s;ting upon his innocence. Though di&s;plea&s;ed at his refu&s;al, the King was unwilling to treat him with rigour, and &s;ent W. Herbert and Secretary Petre to acquaint him, that, if the words of the confe&s;&s;ion propo&s;ed &s;eemed too har&s;h, he might devi&s;e others, provided he made a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He refu&s;ing to modify them, and &s;tand|ing peremptorily on his ju&s;tification, new articles, and a new &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, were drawn up for him to &s;ub&s;cribe; the former containing the mo&s;t material &s;teps taken in the reformation, of which he was to expre&s;s his ap|probation, and declare him&s;elf willing to vindicate them in the pulpit. When they were brought him, he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to make a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: and, as for the other articles, he would not declare his opinion, till he &s;hould be &s;et at liberty; it not being rea&s;onable he &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe them in pri&s;on. It was hereupon re&s;olved, to &s;end for him before the council, and exa|mine him whether he would &s;tand to that an&s;wer; and, in ca&s;e he did, to denounce a &s;eque&s;tration of his tem|poralities for three months, with intimation, that, if he did not comply in that time, he &s;hould be deprived. This was done on July 19; and, when the articles were read to him, he refu&s;ed either to &s;ub&s;cribe or con&s;ent; profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf de&s;irous to obey the King, in all his
<PB N="123" REF="132">lawful commands; but as &s;everal things were de&s;ired of him again&s;t his con&s;cience, he de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. The &s;eque&s;tration was then read: and, though it ex|pired on October 19, nothing was attempted again&s;t him till November 23, when a committee was appoint|ed, by the council, to con&s;ider of the legal &s;teps ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be taken in order for his deprivation. A commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued, on December 12, to Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley Bi&s;hop of London, Tho|mas Goodrich Bi&s;hop of Ely, Henry Holbech Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, Sir William Petre, Sir James Hales, and other lawyers, directing them to call the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter before them, and proceed to deprive him, if he continued in his ob&s;tinacy. His trial beginning on the 15th, he de&s;ired a copy of the commi&s;&s;ion, and the articles exhibited again&s;t him, which accordingly were allowed him: and entered a prote&s;t again&s;t his judges, as being prejudiced again&s;t him; excepting, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, again&s;t Sir Anthony Wingfield, Sir William Cecil, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Edward North, and other per&s;ons of rank, that were examined as wit|ne&s;&s;es. He was allowed to choo&s;e his own council, and had the liberty of producing &s;everal of the King's council, as witne&s;&s;es, in his behalf. Gardiner was &s;o well ver&s;ed in all the dilatory pleas and quirks of the civil and canon laws, that his trial took up twenty-two &s;e&s;&s;ions: but his manife&s;t contempt, and continued di&s;obedience, of the King's orders, and the laws made for e&s;tabli&s;hing the reformation, being fully proved, &s;entence was at la&s;t, on February 14 next following, pronounced again&s;t him, declaring him deprived, and his &s;ee vacant. He hoped to prevent its execution, by appealing from it, as unju&s;t and invalid, to the King: but the commi&s;&s;ioners would not receive it, till they fir&s;t knew his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure. During the cour&s;e of his trial, he had behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much irre|verence to the King, with &s;uch calumnious reflections on the council, and with &s;uch in&s;olence to his judges,
<PB N="124" REF="133">calling them Heretics and Sacramentarians, that he had no rea&s;on to expect &s;uch a favour: and on this ac|count an order was made the next day in council, for removing him to a meaner lodging in the Tower, with only one &s;ervant about him, to be appointed by the Lieutenant, and for debarring him of all vi&s;its and corre&s;pondence, as well as the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the council was &s;tripping &s;uch of their power as were avowed enemies of the reforma|tion,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Peter Martyr, and other fo|reigners, ar|rive in Eng|land.</NOTE> they found its progre&s;s ob&s;tructed, and even its &s;ettlement attacked in certain particular points, by &s;ome, who pretend|ed to be the mo&s;t zealous for it in the main, and by whom they expected it would be be&s;t promoted. When the Emperor Charles V. had cru&s;hed the Smalcalde league, taken John Frederic Elector of Saxony at Mulberg, and, by a &s;candalous prevarication, got Philip Landgrave of He&s;&s;e into his hands, he thought him&s;elf ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Germany: and, no body daring to oppo&s;e his will, he had got an edict pa&s;&s;ed in a diet, for regu|lating the exerci&s;e of religion throughout the empire, agreeable to his own notions of things, but in &s;uch a manner as did not plea&s;e many of the Romani&s;ts, and was generally dete&s;ted by the Prote&s;tants. This edict was called the <HI>interim,</HI> becau&s;e it was only to take place till the council of Trent &s;hould have determined by its deci&s;ions all matters relating to religion, and all di&s;puted points, either of faith or eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;ci|pline: and it was en&s;orced by the &s;evere&s;t penalties, in ca&s;e of non-compliance. The divines of the Pro|te&s;tant churches, being the chief objects of the Emperor's indignation, were forced, in 1548, to ab&s;cond for the &s;afety of their lives. In this di&s;tre&s;s, Archbi&s;hop Cranmer got from the King a pen&s;ion of forty marks a-year, for Peter Martyr Vermiglio, a learned Floren|tine, &s;ettled at Stra&s;burgh: and invited him over to
<PB N="125" REF="134">England; where, after entertaining him &s;ome time in his own hou&s;e, he procured him a canonry of Chri&s;t|church, and the chair of divinity profe&s;&s;or in the uni|ver&s;ity of Oxford. In the year following, he did the &s;ame &s;ervice for Martin Bucer, and Paul Fagius; getting each of them pen&s;ions of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year: the latter was appointed Hebrew lecturer at Cambridge, but died in a few weeks; and the former, being made profe&s;&s;or there, performed the functions of his charge with excellent abilities and an unwearied application, to the general &s;atisfaction, and the great advantage, of the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ities were at this time in no little di&s;tre&s;s, not being &s;ufficiently endowed,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Propo&s;ed vi|&s;itation of the two univer&s;i|ties.</NOTE> and abun|dance of &s;tudents being forced to leave them for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The King indeed &s;ent them relief from time to time, and maintained profe&s;&s;ors for their in&s;truc|tion: but the avarice of his courtiers rendered the little they enjoyed very precarious, and was a great di&s;couragement to the progre&s;s of their &s;tudies. Com|mi&s;&s;ions had been i&s;&s;ued for a vi&s;itation of both the&s;e &s;eminaries, under pretence of removing all remains of &s;uper&s;tition, with &s;uch as maintained them; but the vi&s;itors were empowered likewi&s;e to unite two colleges into one, by which the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of one of them would of cour&s;e be effected, and the courtiers have an opportunity of procuring grants of its revenues. This advantage they commonly made upon all alterations: and it was the true meaning of tho&s;e exchanges, which were made of lands, upon the vacancy of &s;ees, between the King and the new Bi&s;hops. Thus, when Ridley was tran&s;lated to London, the manors of Braintree, Southmin&s;ter, Hackney, and Stepney, with the Mar&s;h, were exchanged for other lands, and &s;ome impropria|tions of the &s;ame or a better value, &s;o that the crown had no advantage by the bargain: yet tho&s;e manors
<PB N="126" REF="135">were no &s;ooner in the King's hands, than Lord Rich obtained a grant of the fir&s;t, Sir Thomas Darcy of the &s;econd, and the Lord Wentworth of the two la&s;t of tho&s;e manors. Ridley, one of the vi&s;itors for Cambridge, when he found how far their commi&s;&s;ions extended, ea&s;ily &s;aw through the de&s;ign; and, refu&s;ing to act in it, put a &s;top to its execution; probably defeating, at the &s;ame time, the other intended for Oxford.</P>
<P>The before-mentioned foreign profe&s;&s;ors had been continually engaged in di&s;putations concerning the controverted points of religion; particularly the ma&s;s and tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, which the Roman Catholics con|&s;idered as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles of their faith, and in which, for that rea&s;on, they were allowed a full li|berty of arguing and defending their &s;entiments.

In the infancy of a refor|mation, nothing could be of more pernicious con&s;e|quence, or more likely to prevent its &s;ucceeding, than &s;uch a non-conformity and divi&s;ion among its profe&s;|&s;ors, as had appeared &s;ome years before, and was now evident in Germany, from the divi&s;ion between the Lutherans, Zuinglians, and Calvini&s;ts, about the &s;a|crament:
<PB N="127" REF="136">yet &s;uch was the conduct of John a La&s;co, a Poli&s;h Baron, who came over with a great number of German and other foreign refugees, to whom he &s;erved as chief pa&s;tor.

The church of the Au|gu&s;tine Friars, with its &s;oil, &s;cite, and appurtenances in London, was al&s;o granted them, for holding their religious a&s;&s;emblies, and they were authori&s;ed to u&s;e their own rites and ceremonies in the wor&s;hip of God, and to exerci&s;e their own eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, though they differed from the government and forms of wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church of England.</P>

Their conduct in this point was probably owing to their compa&s;&s;ion for &s;trangers, per&s;ecuted and denied the exerci&s;e of their religion in their own country: but there &s;eems to have been an|other rea&s;on for putting all the&s;e foreign congregations under the &s;uperintendency of John a La&s;co; by who&s;e care and vigilance it was hoped, that a &s;top might be put to the re&s;ort of Anabapti&s;ts from 2broad, and that, with whatever privacy they came over, they might be di&s;covered foon after their arrival.</P>

A commi&s;&s;ion had accordingly been i&s;&s;ued, the la&s;t year, for enquiring after, and pro&s;ecuting, the&s;e here|tics; and many of them being &s;eized, made all a recantation, except Jane Boacher (commonly called Joan of Kent), and George Van Paris, a Dutch|man, before-mentioned, who were the only per&s;ons that &s;uffered capitally, in this reign, for religious &s;entiments. The preceding year, there had been in|tercepted a letter from Delft, May 12, 1549, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to Gardiner and another Engli&s;h Bi&s;hop, and acquainting them, "that the reformation had been carried on in England by Edward VI. with &s;o much temper and judgment, that all the Prote&s;tants and other reformed in Germany, were inclined to unite with the Engli&s;h church, and e&s;tabli&s;h epi&s;copacy

Hooper had been educated at Oxford; had &s;tudied the &s;criptures with great diligence; and made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in learning: he had, in the late King's reign, &s;hewed his affection to the points of reformation, then e&s;tabli&s;hed, in &s;uch a manner, that, after the act of the &s;ix articles, he did not think it &s;afe to &s;tay in England. Retiring to Zu|rich, he became acquainted there with Bullinger and other learned men; and contracted there a fondne&s;s
<PB N="131" REF="140">for the wor&s;hip and u&s;ages of the Zuinglian or Helvetic churches; though he differed from their divines in &s;ome part of doctrine, particularly concerning pre|de&s;tination. Returning in this reign to England, he grew very popular by the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of his talent of preaching; and in &s;uch favour with the Earl of Warwick, that he not only recommended him to the King for the &s;ee of Glouce&s;ter, but wrote to Arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer, on July 23, to excu&s;e him from wearing the Rochet, and other pontifical habits, at his con&s;ecration, and from taking any oath burthen&s;ome to his con&s;cience. The Archbi&s;hop could not di&s;pen&s;e with the laws of the land, and the rules of the church, nor con&s;errate Hooper in the manner he de&s;ired, with|out incurring a premunire: and, to remove this diffi|culty, the King was per&s;uaded to write a letter, on Augu&s;t 5, to Cranmer, "warranting him, by the advice of his council, to omit the ceremonies, that di&s;plea&s;ed Hooper, and di&s;charging him from all man|ner of dangers, penalties, and forfeitures, which he might incur by law for &s;uch an omi&s;&s;ion." Hooper's objection to the oath was not &s;o much the matter of it, as to the form at the conclu&s;ion, <HI>So help me God, all Saints, and the Holy Go&s;pels:</HI> and the King's &s;triking out the words, <HI>all &s;aints</HI> with his own hand, removed his &s;cruples on that &s;ubject. Tho&s;e, which he had entertained about the epi&s;copal habits, &s;till remained, nor would Cranmer and Ridley con&s;ent to the omi&s;&s;ion, con&s;idering it as a thing that would be de&s;tructive of all order, and be attended by numberle&s;s ill con&s;e|quences. They repre&s;ented this &s;o effectually to the King, that he grew very angry with Hooper for his unrea&s;onable &s;tiffne&s;s: and the Earl of Warwick think|ing fit to drop him too, he was, for his di&s;obedience and contempt, ordered to keep his hou&s;e, and not &s;tir out, unle&s;s to &s;ee the Archbi&s;hop, or the Bi&s;hop of London, Ely, and Lincoln, for the &s;atisfaction of his con&s;cience, and neither to preach or write without

He &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his ob&s;tinacy: and, in contempt of the order of council, wrote and printed a book, intitled, <HI>a confe&s;&s;ion of his faith,</HI> in order to ju&s;tify his conduct; written in &s;uch a manner as to give a great di&s;tate, and containing matters that de&s;erved cen&s;ure; and went abroad freely, preach|ing in the churches of London, &s;aying things too bitter and unrea&s;onable in his &s;ermons, and exclaiming wherever he went again&s;t the King's coun&s;ellors.

Nay, &s;uch an humour of recu&s;ancy then began to break out, that one Steven, curate of Catherine Cree church, preached at St. Paul's cro&s;s, that it was fit the names of churches &s;hould be altered, and the names of the days of the week changed; that fi&s;h-days &s;hould be altered, and Lent kept at any other time, except between Shrove|tide and Ea&s;ter. John Stow, in his chronicles, &s;aith, that be had &s;een the &s;aid Steven leave the pulpit, and preach to the people from an high elm tree, which &s;tood in the mid&s;t of the church-yard, and, after &s;ermon was done, return to the church.</NOTE>. Thus aro&s;e that oppo&s;ition, which has continued ever &s;ince, again&s;t the liturgy, the cap, &s;urplice, and other u&s;ages of the church of England. John a La&s;co, abu&s;ing the indulgence of the government to his foreign congregations, not only encouraged Hooper in his &s;cruples, but joined with the <HI>Calvinian</HI> faction, which now began to appear, in all their ob|jections to the cap and &s;urplice, and other orders of the church; for which he was &s;everely reptimanded by Bucer, a man of excellent learning, judgment, temper, and moderation; who, making a &s;olid an&s;wer to all his ob|jections, &s;ent it him in a letter, which was afterwards publi&s;hed. John a La&s;co had received his education in Poland, a country over run with Arians and Soci|nians, who, denying the divinity of our Saviour, treated him in a manner as their equal, by &s;itting with him at his table: and, publi&s;hing a book, entitled, <HI>Forma et ratio totius eccle&s;ia&s;tici mini&s;terii,</HI> maintained the prac|tice of <HI>&s;itting at the Holy Communion,</HI> contrary to the u&s;age and expre&s;s direction of the church of England.</P>

The difficulties which, for want of the propo&s;ed reform of eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, the Bi&s;hops lay under in the exerci&s;e of their authority, prevented the irregularities of tho&s;e refractory per&s;ons from being repre&s;&s;ed by a proper di&s;cipline. When, in the fir&s;t part of this King's reign, the government had &s;et about a reformation, Cavlin had wrote to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, offering his &s;ervice in the work: but Cranmer knew the bu&s;y, pragmatical tem|per of the man too well to accept his officer. This was a &s;light that Calvin's pride could not dige&s;t: failing in his application to the Archbi&s;hop, he endeavoured to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the Protector's favour; and, &s;ucceeding in his de&s;ign, wrote him a very long letter, in which, approving of &s;et forms of prayer, he finds fault with the Engli&s;h liturgy in &s;ome particulars. The&s;e were, <HI>the commemoration of the dead,</HI> which he acknowledged however to be very antient, <HI>the u&s;e of chri&s;m,</HI> and the <HI>unction</HI> in the vi&s;itation of the &s;ick, the la&s;t whereof was rather allowed then enjoined. He advi&s;ed, that the&s;e, with &s;ome other rites and cere|monies, &s;hould be abrogated: he had emi&s;&s;aries every where to &s;tart objections again&s;t what had been e&s;tabli&s;h|ed without his advice; and was for having every thing given up, that offended a few particulars, and might become matter of contention. Thus altars were to be taken down, being complained of as encouraging peo|ple in the Popi&s;h notions of the &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s; they had been removed already in &s;ome places, and tables put in their &s;tead, by per&s;ons who thought the latter more agreeable to primitive chri&s;tianity, &s;ince our Saviour in&s;tituted the &s;acrament of his body and blood at a table, not at an altar, and there is no ap|pearance of the Apo&s;tles having ever u&s;ed an altar in their mini&s;tration. An order of council was made, on November 24, and &s;ent to the Bi&s;hops, for taking away altars in every church and chapel of their re&s;pective
<PB N="135" REF="144">dioce&s;es, and &s;etting up tables in their &s;tead, in &s;ome convenient part of the chancel of &s;uch church, to &s;erve for the mini&s;tration of the holy communion. Ridley took care to execute this order, without lo&s;s of time, in his own dioce&s;e; but it was not ob&s;erved univer&s;ally over the kingdom, till the repeal of the fir&s;t liturgy, in which the prie&s;t was directed to &s;tand <HI>before the mid|dle of the altar</HI> in the celebration, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;econd, which requires him to &s;tand <HI>on the north &s;ide of the table.</HI> It was pretended, that this change was not any way repugnant to the rules of the fir&s;t liturgy, becau&s;e the names of <HI>altar, the Lord's board,</HI> and <HI>table,</HI> were u&s;ed in it indifferently; and the &s;ame po&s;ition <HI>before the middle of the table</HI> might be &s;till ob&s;erved: it cau&s;ed however a great diver&s;ity of prac|tice, till the revi&s;ion of the liturgy, &s;et about by Cal|vin's influence, was fini&s;hed.</P>

The King had wrote to her many letters to draw her off from the church of Rome; the Lords of the council had done the &s;ame, but all in vain; &s;he would confer with none of the Bi&s;hops &s;ent to in&s;truct her, nor hearken to any arguments again&s;t her pre&s;ent per&s;ua&s;ion. She had, out of regard to the Emperor, been hitherto indulged in having ma&s;s &s;aid in her family, but with two re&s;trictions, viz. that no body &s;hould be pre&s;ent at it be&s;ides her own dome&s;tic &s;ervants, and that her chaplains &s;hould celebrate it only in her pre|&s;ence. Her &s;pirit was too haughty to bear the&s;e re|&s;trictions, and her ob&s;tinacy was too determinate to allow her to conform. In this &s;ituation, &s;he re&s;olved to retire to the court of the Queen Regent in Flanders;
<PB N="136" REF="145">a &s;tep, which in all probability would have prevented her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, and cannot be accounted for, but from the great idea &s;he had formed of the Emperor's irre&s;i&s;tible power. A &s;cheme was laid for conveying her beyond &s;ea from E&s;&s;ex, where &s;he then re&s;ided: Flemi&s;h &s;hips were provided to re|ceive her on board; and a commotion was to be rai&s;ed in the country, that &s;he might in the tumult e&s;cape. The King, being informed of the de&s;ign, &s;ent, on July 13, Sir John Gates, with &s;ome forces, to pre|vent its execution; and ordered the coa&s;t to be &s;ecured, and a fleet to put to &s;ea: and di&s;patched the Lord Chancellor Rich, with Sir W.

Orders were &s;ent, on December 15, to apprehend her chaplains, Mallet and Berkley, for not ob&s;erving the re&s;trictions above mentioned: they were committed to pri&s;on; nor could all her in&s;tances procure their relea&s;e. Several letters pa&s;&s;ed between her and the council on the &s;ubject; in which &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted much on a promi&s;e, made to the Emperor, for a di&s;pen&s;ation with the laws in her favour; and they denied its being made, at lea&s;t in &s;uch a latitude as &s;he pretended.</P>

On this occa&s;ion, declaring her re&s;olution not to change her opinions in religion, &s;he was told, that the King did not purpo&s;e to con&s;train her in that point, but only to re&s;train her in the outward profe&s;&s;ion of it, on ac|count of the inconveniences that might thence en&s;ue. The Emperor's amba&s;&s;ador threatening, in his name, to denounce war, if &s;he was not allowed the free exer|ci&s;e of her religion, Dr. Wotton was &s;ent over, a|bout
<PB N="137" REF="146">the middle of April, with directions, "to de&s;ire that the Emperor would be le&s;s violent in his reque&s;ts," and to inform him, "that if the Lady Mary was his cou&s;in, &s;he was likewi&s;e the King's &s;i&s;ter, and his &s;ub|ject too; that, as the King was a Sovereign Prince de|pending on none but God, there was no rea&s;on for the Emperor to intermeddle, either with ordering his &s;ub|jects, or directing the affairs of his realm." He was however authori&s;ed to offer, "that whatever favours the King's &s;ubjects were allowed in the Emperor's do|minions in point of religion, the Emperor's &s;ubjects &s;hould receive the &s;ame in England; but further than this, his ma&s;ter would not go; and it would be in vain to pre&s;s him any more on the &s;ubject." This re&s;olute an&s;wer prevented any more &s;uch menaces for the future.</P>
<P>On Augu&s;t 12, Roche&s;ter, Waldegrave, and Ingle|field, the chief officers of the Prince&s;s Mary's hou&s;hold, being &s;ent for to court, were charged with orders from the council, inhibiting the u&s;e of any &s;ervice, but the Engli&s;h liturgy, in her family, and with letters from the King notifying the&s;e orders to his &s;i&s;ter. They were likewi&s;e enjoined, to notify the&s;e orders to her hou&s;hold, and to &s;tay there to &s;ee them ob&s;erved: but, upon her forbidding them to do &s;o, they returned, without executing this part of their commi&s;&s;ion. The council requiring them to go back to Copthall, and execute it, they all refu&s;ed: and were for the con|tempt &s;ent pri&s;oners to the Tower; from whence they were not di&s;charged till the April following. The council cho&s;e to &s;ignify the inhibition to the Prince&s;s, by her own &s;ervants, imagining it would palliate the har&s;hne&s;s of the order: but upon their refu&s;al the Lord Chancellor Rich, Sir Ant. Wingfield, and Sir W. Petre, were &s;ent to &s;ee it executed. The Empe|ror's amba&s;&s;ador, interpo&s;ing, was told, that the King would have the laws ob&s;erved by all his &s;ubjects; and the Prince&s;s finding that the Emperor's authority availed her &s;o little, gave little further trouble on that &s;ubject, though &s;he had met with &s;everal mortifications

It was never known in this nation, till the begin|ning of the reign of Henry VII.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page <HI>375</HI> of vol. <HI>ii.</HI> of this work.</NOTE> and was &s;o peculiar to the Eng|li&s;h, that it &s;eized and carried them off in other countries, without affecting any of the natives; and no foreigners were troubled with it in England. Any per&s;on that was &s;eized with it, either died or re|covered in about ten hours; if a man indulged the inclination it gave him to &s;leep, he died in &s;ix hours; and in half that time if he catched any cold. It raged mo&s;tly among per&s;ons of robu&s;t con&s;titutions; old men and women, and young children, being either not &s;ubject to it, or attacked but very &s;lightly; and it proved &s;o fatal that &s;carce one in a hundred e&s;caped, till time had found out a remedy, by the following method. Tho&s;e &s;eized with it by night, in bed, were to keep there twenty-four hours; if in the day time, to throw them&s;elves imme|diately, with their cloaths on, into bed for the &s;ame term; not covered &s;o much as to provoke &s;weat, but to let it flow off gently. They were to ab&s;tain, if po&s;&s;ible, from eating or drinking, or at lea&s;t not drink more than ju&s;t &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;wage their thir&s;t: and, above all, they were not to uncover any part of their bodies; the putting a hand or foot out of bed being mortal. At London eight hundred died of it in a week: and a great number were carried off by it in the re&s;t of the kingdom. A little before this di&s;temper broke out, a terrible earthquake happened at Croydon in Surry, and &s;ome other places in the neighbourhood. Six dolphins were taken in the Thames, three at Queenborough, and the other three below Greenwich, all as big as hor&s;es. The&s;e uncommon accidents were looked upon by credulous and ignorant people, as pre&s;ages of the troubles which &s;oon afterwards afflicted the kingdom.</NOTE>, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, had an opportunity to gratify Henry Grey Marquis of Dor&s;et (who had married Frances, the&s;e noblemens &s;i&s;ter of the half blood, and the elde&s;t daughter of Charles Brandon, by Mary, &s;i&s;ter to Henry VIII.) with the title of the Duke of Suffolk. This honour was conferred on him on October 11; Warwick being, at the &s;ame time, created Duke of Northumberland;
<PB N="139" REF="148">William Pawlet, Earl of Wilt&s;hire, Marquis of Win|che&s;ter; and Sir W. Herbert, Baron of Cardi&s;t and Earl of Pembroke. The&s;e two la&s;t were Dudley's creatures, &s;ub&s;ervient to him in all his mea&s;ures; and in rai&s;ing the latter to the&s;e honours, he had highly obliged William Parr Marquis of Northampton, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter Herbert had married. The new Duke of Suffolk, a weak man, and ea&s;ily drawn into any &s;tep, natu|rally fell under Northumberland's management, upon the alliance between them by the marriage of his fifth &s;on, Lord Guilford Dudley, with the Lady Jane Grey, the other's elde&s;t daughter. This young lady, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of the age, was next to her mother in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, in ca&s;e of Ed|ward's decea&s;e, had the lines of the two daughters of Henry VIII. and of his &s;i&s;ter Margaret, been extinct<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 60 of this volume.</NOTE>: and, as Northumberland propo&s;ed to &s;et a&s;ide the two Prince&s;&s;es, Mary and Elizabeth, on pretence of ille|gitimacy, and depending on the aver&s;ion of the En|gli&s;h to a Scotch and French government, de&s;igned to exclude the de&s;cendants of Margaret, who&s;e heir, Mary Queen of Scotland, was contracted to Francis Dauphin of France, and to rai&s;e his own family to the throne of England.</P>
<P>As he had little rea&s;on to expect much oppo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Duke of Somer&s;et tried and beheaded.</NOTE> excepting from the Duke of Somer&s;et, and a few of his friends, he de|termined to work their ruin. The reconciliation be|tween Somer&s;et and him, on an alliance of their fa|milies, by a marriage between John Dudley Earl of Warwick (Northumberland's elde&s;t &s;on) and Somer|&s;et's daughter Lady Anne, was but feigned on the the part of Northumberland, who &s;oon found an op|portunity of effecting his rival's de&s;truction. After the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the commotions in Devon&s;hire, Norfolk, &amp;c. already mentioned, an act to prevent
<PB N="140" REF="149">&s;uch in&s;urrections for the future had pa&s;&s;ed, making it "trea&s;on for more than twelve per&s;ons to a&s;&s;emble together, in order to pull down inclo&s;ures, alter reli|gion, or any of the laws, or to take, kill, or impri&s;on, a Privy Coun&s;ellor, if they did not di&s;per&s;e within an hour after the reading of a proclamation." After &s;ome other paragraphs relating to the principal de&s;ign of the act, a clau&s;e was added, enacting, "that if any per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hould, by open word or deed, procure, move, or &s;tir, any other per&s;on or per&s;ons to ri&s;e, or make any other traiterous or rebellious a&s;&s;em|bly, with intent to do, exerci&s;e, or put in u&s;e any of the things above-mentioned, every per&s;on &s;hould be adjudged a felon, and &s;uffer death and forfeitures, as in ca&s;es of felony, without either benefit of clergy or &s;anctuary." Upon this act was founded the plan for entrapping Somer&s;et; the putting him in fear of his life would naturally make him take mea&s;ures to defend it; and Northumberland's openly avowing him&s;elf his enemy afforded grounds enough for &s;uch apprehen&s;ions. A gentleman named Whalley had been taken up and examined, on February 16, about his per&s;uading &s;e|veral noblemen of the realm, to make the Duke of Somer&s;et Protector at the next parliament: and though no further di&s;covery appears to have been made of this de&s;ign, it was thought impolitic to let the Duke live till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;To pave the way for his ruin, he was repre&s;ented as a proud a&s;piring per&s;on, who&s;e ambition had no other bounds than the crown it&s;elf. His doors were watched, and notice taken of all that went in or out; his words were ob&s;erved, made wor&s;e by repeating, and aggravated by odious circum&s;tan|ces to his di&s;advantage: and no arts of fraud and treachery left unpracti&s;ed, that might bring him into &s;u&s;picion with the King, and di&s;grace with the com|mon people. Somer&s;et's friends &s;oon &s;u&s;pected, that the&s;e practices were the prelude to his and their ruin: and it is not unlikely, that, in conferring together upon
<PB N="141" REF="150">this &s;ubject, &s;ome hot incon&s;iderate per&s;on might pro|po&s;e a violent attempt again&s;t the Duke of Northum|berland, though no mea&s;ures &s;eem to have been taken for putting &s;uch a de&s;ign in execution. However Northumberland had &s;o be&s;et the King with his crea|tures, that nothing could come to his ear but through their conveyance: and things were &s;o repre&s;ented, that he con&s;ented to the pro&s;ecution of his uncle. What confirmed him in this re&s;olution, &s;eems to have been an information, given, on October 7, by Sir Thomas Palmer, "that, on the la&s;t St. George's day, So|mer&s;et propo&s;ed &s;etting out for the North to rai&s;e people, if Sir W. Herbert, Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, had not a&s;&s;ured him upon his honour, that he &s;hould have no hurt, and the Lord Grey went before to &s;ee who were his friends; that afterwards it was contrived to invite Northumberland, Northampton and others to a banquet, and either to kill them there, or &s;et upon them by the way, if they came thinly attended; that Sir Thomas Arundel had &s;ecured the Tower, Sir Miles Partridge, attended by Seymour and Hammond, was to rai&s;e London; that Sir Ralph Vane, with 2000 foot, which he had in readine&s;s, and Somer&s;et's troop of 100 hor&s;e, were to attack the Gens d'Armes on a mu&s;ter-day; and, if he were beaten, the Duke was to run through London, crying, <HI>Liberty, liberty,</HI> to rai&s;e the apprentices, and, if he could, to make his way to Poole or the I&s;le of Wight." Somer&s;et, being appri&s;ed of the reformation, charged Palmer with it: but he ab&s;olutely denied it.&mdash;His grace, with the Lord Grey, John and David Seymour, Neudigate, Ham|mond, two of the Duke's &s;ervants, Sir Thomas Pal|mer, and Sir Ralph Vane, were arre&s;ted, and all, ex|cept the three la&s;t, committed to the Tower; the next day, the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, with her favourites Crane and his wife, and her chamber keeper, Sir Miles Partridge, and James Wingfield, were &s;ent to the &s;ame pri&s;on; as Sir Michael Stanhope, Banni&s;ter, and
<PB N="142" REF="151">Vaughan, were, the day following. Crane depo&s;ed much to the &s;ame effect as Palmer, only adding, "that the Lord Paget's hou&s;e was to be the place of the banquet; that the Earl of Arundel knew of the con|&s;piracy; and that, in Augu&s;t la&s;t, the Duke of So|mer&s;et, pretending to be &s;ick, had gone privately into London, to &s;ee what friends he could make in the city." All that Hammond confe&s;&s;ed, amounted to no more, than that "the Duke had armed men to guard him, one night, in his hou&s;e at Greenwich." Arundel, and Paget, were hereupon &s;ent, on Novem|ber 8, to the Tower: and the pro&s;ecution &s;lept till December 1, when Somer&s;et was brought to his trial in We&s;tmin&s;ter hall, before the Marquis of Winche&s;ter, as high &s;teward. Twenty &s;even peers compo&s;ed the jury; Northumberland, Northampton and Pembroke, the fir&s;t a party, and all three his profe&s;&s;ed enemies, being of the number; and, what was as &s;urpri&s;ing, the Lord Chancellor Rich, though a peer, was left out.</P>
<P>To make up in parade, what might be defective in the force of the evidence, twenty-two peers had been extraordinarily a&s;&s;embled, the day before the trial, to hear Palmer, Crane, and Hammond &s;wear, before the King and council, to the truth of what they had affirmed in their different examinations, which were drawn up in form, in order to be produ|ced in court at the trial. The&s;e depo&s;itions were calculated to &s;upport three indictments again&s;t the Duke for &s;o many different de&s;igns,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To &s;eize the King's per&s;on, and govern all affairs:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To &s;eize, in conjunction with 100 others, on the Duke of Nor|thumberland, and impri&s;on him: and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To rai&s;e London.</ITEM>
</LIST> He pre&s;&s;ed to have the witne&s;&s;es brought face to face, that he might have an opportunity of cro&s;s examining them; a point of ju&s;tice, which the Lord Chancellor would &s;carce have refu&s;ed, had he been high &s;teward: but the Marquis of Winche&s;ter ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed his reque&s;t; and the whole evi|dence
<PB N="143" REF="152">re&s;ted upon the written depo&s;itions above-men|tioned, no part whereof contained any proof of the fir&s;t indictment. The council for the King, in ag|gravating other charges, repre&s;ented "the rai&s;ing of men at his hou&s;e, with an ill intent to kill the Duke of Northumberland, to be trea&s;on, by the act of 3 and 4 of Edward VI. <HI>again&s;t unlawful a&s;&s;emblies;</HI> that the rai&s;ing of London was likewi&s;e trea&s;on; that minding to re&s;i&s;t his attachment, a&s;&s;aulting the Lords of the council, and devi&s;ing their deaths, were felony." Somer&s;et, having no council to plead for him, ex|cepted to Palmer as a very wicked man, and urged in his defence, "that he had never any thoughts of rai&s;ing the North, and all the grounds for &s;uch a &s;ur|mi&s;e was, that, being alarmed by rumours of a de&s;ign again&s;t his per&s;on, he had &s;ent for Sir William Her|bert, to be a&s;&s;ured in the matter. As to the ban|quet, he prote&s;ted in the &s;olemne&s;t manner, there was not a &s;yllable of truth in it, and required &s;ome other witne&s;&s;es of that charge might be produced. The attacking of 900 Gens d' armes on a mu&s;ter-day, with only 100 men, was too mad an action for any body to attempt: and he utterly denied it, as well as any de&s;ign of rai&s;ing London, though thinking it the &s;afe&s;t place for him, he had gone into the city, to &s;ee if he could find &s;helter there; none of the witne&s;&s;es being with him, &s;o that they could be no competent evidence of his de&s;ign. He owned his having men one night in his chamber at Greenwich: but &s;aid he meant no harm to any body, and none in particular to the Duke of Northumberland, who&s;e life he was &s;o far from endeavouring to take away, that he had determined to the contrary; that he had a&s;&s;embled tho&s;e men purely for his own defence; and it was plain, he meant no harm, becau&s;e he did none when it was in his power." Such was his defence with regard to the facts charged upon him, and he was acquitted by the Lords as to the trea&s;onable articles: but, though no invitation or
<PB N="144" REF="153">other circum&s;tance was alledged with regard to the banquet, nor was there the &s;malle&s;t evidence of any a&s;&s;ault upon the Lords; yet, whether the men in his chamber at Greenwich were imagined to have been a&s;&s;embled, not for oppo&s;ing any illegal violence to his per&s;on (which &s;eems to have been the real ca&s;e) but to re&s;i&s;t a legal attachment, they found him guilty of fe|lony, and condemned him to be hanged. Somer&s;et received the &s;entence with great re&s;ignation; and having begged the pardon of the Lords, again&s;t whom he had any ill-will, and recommended him&s;elf, his wife and children, to the King's mercy, was &s;ent back to the Tower. The populace, &s;eeing him reconveyed thi|ther without the axe, imagined he had been entirely acquitted, and manife&s;ted their joy in repeated &s;houts and exclamations, till they were informed of his doom, and that there was no occa&s;ion for the axe being carried, as he had been acquitted of the indictment for trea&s;on. It was unfortunate for the condemned nobleman, that the King was &s;o environed with his adver&s;aries, that none of his friends could get acce&s;s, or find any means to repre&s;ent his innocence, and detect the artifices and treachery of his enemies; for Palmer was the per&s;on, who, alarming him with the imminent dan|ger he was in, per&s;uaded him to gather men into his chamber at Greenwich, and &s;ix weeks after his death was put into an honourable employment by Northum|berland, one of who&s;e chief confidents he was ever af|ter, in the advancements of all his projects, particularly in that of getting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ettled in the hou&s;e of Suffolk. Lord Rich, the chancellor, intere&s;ted him|&s;elf in behalf of Somer&s;et; but this corre&s;pondence being accidentally di&s;covered, he was dive&s;ted of the great &s;eal, the cu&s;tody of which was committed to Thomas Goodwich, bi&s;hop of Ely. The King having &s;igned the warrant for beheading his uncle, that noble|man, on January 22, in the en&s;uing year, was between eight and nine in the morning brought to a &s;caffold
<PB N="145" REF="154">on Tower hill, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the people, a&s;&s;ured them, that "his intentions had been not only harmle&s;s in re&s;pect to particular per&s;ons, but always tending to the common good of the King and kingdom." He was interrupted for a while by the crouds which came running from the Hamlets, and by Sir Anthony Brown's advancing to the place on a gallop, which cau&s;ed a general expectation of a pardon, and great &s;houts of joy among the populace. When the tumult was over, he went on "to make a confe&s;&s;ion of his faith; ble&s;&s;ing God for making him an in&s;trument in the reformation; exhorting all to per&s;evere in it, to obey the King, whom he had never offended by word or deed; having been ever diligent in taking care of his affairs both at home and abroad, and in promoting the good of the people (to which the populace a&s;&s;ented, crying out, <HI>it was very true</HI>) and declaring he forgave all the world," &s;ubmitted to the block with great tranquillity, firmne&s;s, and intrepidity. Thus fell Ed|ward Seymour, Duke of Somer&s;et, a nobleman of a middling genius, not without virtues, being gentle and beneficent in his nature, humble and affable in his great|ne&s;s, &s;incere and candid in his tran&s;actions, compa&s;&s;i|onate to the afflicted, careful of the poor, animated with zeal for the religion he thought right, and &s;o well be|loved by the people, that numbers of them dipped their handkerchiefs in his blood, to keep him in their remembrance. His good qualities were intervoven with &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, among which pride, ambition, and vanity, &s;eemed to preponderate: but his admi|ni&s;tration of public affairs was never charged with any blemi&s;h of corruption; and no encomium but is due to his merit in the excellent education he gave his Prince; an advantage few meet with that &s;ucceed to the throne in their minority.</P>
<P>Several of Somer&s;et's friends &s;uffered,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Somer&s;et's friends exe|cuted.</NOTE> &s;oon after, on the &s;ame account. Sir Thomas Arundel, Sir Michael Stanhope,
<PB N="146" REF="155">Sir Ralph Vane, and Sir Miles Partridge, were all executed on February 26; the two fir&s;t being behead|ed, and the others hanged. They all calling God to witne&s;s, declared at their death, that "they never practi&s;ed trea&s;on again&s;t the King, nor were guilty of any de&s;ign again&s;t any of the Lords of the council." The&s;e agreeing declarations, made at the awful mo|ment of their launching into futurity, confirmed the world in the notion generally entertained before, that the pretended con&s;piracy was all a mere forgery.</P>
<P>Somer&s;et's affair did not prevent or impede the pro|&s;ecution of the Bi&s;hops,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Several Pre|lates deprived of their &s;ees.</NOTE> who, retaining their inclinations to the Papacy, pretended to conform: and, by that means keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ees, were enabled to protect and encourage others in a breach of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed orders, and to ob&s;truct a general uniformity in wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline. John Verey, Bi&s;hop of Ex|eter, had alienated mo&s;t of the manors belonging to his &s;ee; he had granted long lea&s;es of others to &s;ome courtiers, charged with pen&s;ions for his own benefit: and, being either willing to &s;ecure the&s;e, which amount|ed to 485 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year for his life, or apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome trouble, for having, by underhand practices, favoured the Devon&s;hire in&s;urrection, re&s;igned his office. His advanced age, being 87 years old, gave a colour to this act, which &s;ecured the revenue he had provided for him&s;elf, at the expence of his &s;ee: and he was &s;ucceeded by Miles Coverdale, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted Tin|dal in the tran&s;lation of the Bible, and was con&s;ecrated on Augu&s;t 30. George Day, Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, had preached him&s;elf, and &s;uffered others of his dioce&s;e to preach, &s;editious doctrines; to prevent the bad effects whereof, Dr. Cox had, the la&s;t year, on October 7, been &s;ent into Su&s;&s;ex to appea&s;e the people by more whole&s;ome doctrine: and the Bi&s;hop, being &s;ummoned before the council, was, upon his denial of the words of his accu&s;ation, ordered, on November 8, to bring
<PB N="147" REF="156">in writing what he preached. He probably thought this too dangerous: and therefore, on the 28th of that month, he &s;ignified voluntarily to the Duke of Somer|&s;et, that he would not execute the orders, &s;ent him by the King and council; for taking down altars in his dioce&s;e, for &s;etting communion-tables up in &s;ome con|venient part of the chancels, and for in&s;tructing people in the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the alteration. He was, on this account, convened &s;everal times before the coun|cil in the beginning of December: and though he was allowed the liberty of u&s;ing the names of table and altar indifferently, continued &s;o ob&s;tinate in his refu|&s;al, that he was committed to the Fleet. A commi&s;|&s;ion being i&s;&s;ued this year for his examination and trial, he was deprived in the beginning of October; and &s;ucceeded by John Scory, Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter. Ni|cholas Heath, Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, had been impri|&s;oned &s;ome time for refu&s;ing to &s;ub&s;cribe the new or|dinal: and, appearing before the council, on Septem|ber 22, not only per&s;i&s;ted in that refu&s;al, but declared, he would never con&s;ent to the order for &s;etting up tables in room of altars. Being tried for the&s;e con|tempts, at the &s;ame time with Day, he was deprived on October 10, and his &s;ee was granted to John Hooper Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter; the two dioce&s;es being united. Cuthbert Ton&s;tal, Bi&s;hop of Durham, had been accu&s;ed, by Ninian Menville, of knowing, and con&s;enting to, a con&s;piracy in the north, for rai&s;ing a rebellion; he had, in July la&s;t year, made an an&s;wer to that charge, and Menville had replied to it; but the pro&s;ecution was long &s;u&s;pended, for want of a letter of the Bi&s;hop's to Menville, on which the proof chiefly depended. This letter was at la&s;t found among the Duke of Somer&s;et's papers, when they were &s;earched after his la&s;t apprehen&s;ion; and Ton&s;tal was &s;um|moned to appear, on December 20, before the coun|cil. He could not deny the letter to-be his own hand-writing, and, being incapable of giving any &s;a|tisfactory
<PB N="148" REF="157">account of it, was committed to the Tower of London; where he wrote his defence of tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, printed three years after at Paris. Nor were the Bi&s;hops popi&s;hly inclined the only per&s;ons that &s;uffered, at this time, from pro&s;ecutions Robert Farrar, Bi&s;hop of St. David's, having di&s;obliged the chapter of his church, had articles exhibited again&s;t him by a factious party of the canons: and, being di|ve&s;ted of the &s;upport and protection he u&s;ed to receive from his patron the Duke of Somer&s;et, a commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued, to enquire into the merits of the cau&s;e. The articles in general could not but appear trifling, when the mo&s;t material of them were, his going abroad &s;ome|times without a &s;quare cap; his having married a cou|ple, without obliging them to receive the communion; his cau&s;ing the communion-table to be put in or near the place where the altar had &s;tood; his &s;uffering &s;eve|ral &s;uper&s;titious u&s;ages to be retained among the peo|ple (which, in all probability, &s;o zealous a reformer could not help, &s;ince the Welch could not be entirely weaned from them of a long time, notwith&s;tanding all the care of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors) and for exerci&s;ing &s;ome acts of epi&s;copal juri&s;diction in his own name, in derogation of the King's &s;upremacy. The la&s;t article proved more fatal to him than all the re&s;t; being indicted the &s;ummer following of a premunite, at the a&s;&s;izes of Caermarthen, and committed to pri&s;on: where he re|mained all the re&s;t of Edward's reign; and was, in Queen Mary's time, carried thence, to &s;uffer at the &s;take for his religion.</P>

<PB N="149" REF="158">being read thrice the &s;ame day, was rejected by the Commons; nor would the&s;e la&s;t oblige the Duke of Northumberland in agreeing to another bill for depri|ving the Bi&s;hop of Durham, which had likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the upper hou&s;e; though &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury and the Lord Stourton, who entered their di&s;&s;ents. A bill was brought in for qua|lifying the &s;tatute of premunire; and for providing, that no Bi&s;hops or &s;piritual judge &s;hould incur-it by executing his office, unle&s;s he proceeded after a pro|hibition from the courts of law: but this dropped in the upper hou&s;e, the Lords prob$bly not caring to en|courage or &s;ecure the Bi&s;hops in the free exerci&s;e of their juri&s;diction. They had however &s;o much regard to the honour both of church and &s;tate, as to pa&s;s an act, with &s;evere penalties, again&s;t quarrelling, and fighting in churches and church-yards; to prevent the profaning of confecrated places, by &s;uch &s;candalous frays as had been too much practi&s;ed of late, &s;ince the epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and ancient cen&s;ures of the church, were le&s;&s;ened in authority and reputation. The dioce&s;es of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter had been, about two years before, unit$d by letters-patent; it was now thought proper to have its union confirmed by parlia|ment; the authority whereof was probably the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the archdeaconry of St. Alban's, formerly part of the dioce&s;e of Lincoln, was, on this occa&s;ion, annexed to that of London.</P>
<P>On April 15, the parliament was di&s;&s;olved,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The articles of religion publi&s;hed.</NOTE> having fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed two very material acts relating to religion, which had been be|fore approved of by the convocation. One of the&s;e was for the due ob&s;ervation of fa&s;ts and holidays. It was decreed, that all Sundays, with the holidays marked in the calendar and liturgy, &s;hould be kept as holidays; and that the Bi&s;hops &s;hould proceed by eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure again&s;t the refractory. A clau&s;e was added for the ob&s;ervation of St. George's

The eves of holidays were ordained to be kept as fa&s;ts; and ab&s;tinence from fle&s;h on Fridays and Saturdays, as well as in Lent, was en|joined. In the&s;e regulations, the parliament traced the &s;teps of the rubric in the liturgy,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The liturgy revi&s;ed and authori&s;ed.</NOTE> e&s;tabli&s;hing none but what had been before appointed by the convocation. They took the &s;ame method in the act of uni|formity now pa&s;&s;ed, e&s;tabli&s;hing the book of Common|prayer, and the ordinal, which, being &s;ent from the convocation, in order to have the &s;anction of a law added to them, they would have taked to the act, without ever reading them: but this &s;eeming too im|plicit a deference to the clergy, and not becoming the dignity and wi&s;dom of &s;o augu&s;t an a&s;&s;embly, as the parliament of England, they did read it over, but made not the &s;malle&s;t alteration. Calvin, with his emi&s;&s;aries and followers, who were di&s;per&s;ed in different parts of the realm, and were for retrenching every an|cient u&s;age, upon which the Romani&s;ts had grafted any &s;uper&s;titious or erroneous novelty, had made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to rai&s;e doubts about &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the liturgy, as capable of being wre&s;ted &s;o, as to favour the errors and novelties which had been aboli&s;hed: and, in compliance with their importunity, rather than their rea&s;ons, it had been revi&s;ed by a committee of the convocation. The alterations that were made on this occa&s;ion were, a &s;hort form of confe&s;&s;ion, and a decla|ration of a general ab&s;olution to all, that &s;incerely re|pent, and firmly believe in the go&s;pel, added to the morning and evening &s;ervice; and a rubric about the po&s;ture of kneeling at the reception of the euchari&s;t; the omi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, and prayers for &s;ouls departed, in the communion-&s;ervice, and of oil in confirmation; the introducing of the ten com|mandments, with a prayer to God, at the end of each,
<PB N="151" REF="162">for mercy on pa&s;t offences, and grace to keep them for the future, into that &s;ervice, in&s;tead of the <HI>introit;</HI> a change in the form of words and at the delivery, and in &s;ome part of the prayer for the con&s;ecration of the euchari&s;t, with &s;ome le&s;&s;er variations. The liturgy, thus revi&s;ed and altered, was now, together with the ordinal, confirmed by act of parliament.</P>
<P>That a&s;&s;embly did not interfere in another affair, which pa&s;&s;ed at this time in convocation, to who&s;e cog|nizance it properly belonged. When well-meaning men, in former days, &s;ound fault with the corruptions of the <HI>court of Rome,</HI> or rejected any of the new notions of the &s;choolmen, it was an ordinary policy in the Romani&s;ts, not only to charge tho&s;e men with other doctrines, which they either did not profe&s;s, or expre&s;&s;|ly di&s;avowed, but al&s;o with &s;uch as were mo&s;t likely to render them odious. The &s;ame method was taken with regard to Luther and his followers in Germany; who, to refute the calumnies thrown upon them, found it nece&s;&s;ary to draw up <HI>a confe&s;&s;ion of their faith</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">See it in vol. i. of this work, p. 128.</NOTE>, and pre&s;ent it to Charles V. and the e&s;tates of the empire, a&s;&s;embled, in 1530, at the diet of Aug&s;burgh. It had the de&s;ired effect, and the example was followed by other reformed churches; who, being likewi&s;e a&s;per&s;ed, were obliged to take the like method of a public vin|dication. The&s;e <HI>confe&s;&s;ions</HI> were not only very u&s;eful for repelling the attacks of their adver&s;aries, but &s;erved al&s;o for a &s;tated rule among them&s;elves, in confor|mity to which all private per&s;ons, of their re&s;pective communion, were to form their judgments, and for declaring the harmony between them and other nati|onal churches, which had thrown off the Papal yoke. The clergy of the church of England had an&s;wered the&s;e ends, in a good mea&s;ure, by the public liturgy, and the homilies publi&s;hed in the Engli&s;h tongue for the in&s;truction of the people: but it was &s;till conceived
<PB N="152" REF="163">nece&s;&s;ary, at lea&s;t for the &s;atisfaction of the foreign world, to lay down in form a public rule, as well to te&s;tify their orthodoxy in all the e&s;&s;ential articles of faith, as to &s;hew their di&s;&s;ent from the innovations of the church of Rome, and of the opinions of the Ana|bapti&s;ts and other &s;ectaries. With the&s;e views, Cran|mer, Ridley, and other divines, drew up a book of articles; which being now approved in convocation, were tran&s;lated into Latin by Dr. Heddon, univer&s;ity orator at Cambridge, and Sir John Cheek, and pub|li&s;hed in Latin by the royal authority, enjoining all the clergy to &s;ub&s;cribe them, "for the avoiding of diver|&s;ities of opinions, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing con&s;ent touching true religions." It was impo&s;&s;ible, in &s;uch a work, to avoid touching on &s;ome points canva&s;&s;ed in the &s;chools, which the warmth of debates made people, at that time, imagine to be of greater con&s;equence than they are in reality: but there were as few notions of this kind in them, as the exigence of the times would allow. The&s;e articles agree in &s;ub&s;tance with tho&s;e af|terwards e&s;tabli&s;hed in the convocation of 1562; the latter being rather explanatory of the former in points, wherein there is a variety of expre&s;&s;ion, than any way different in re&s;pect of doctrine. A catechi&s;m was like|wi&s;e publi&s;hed at this time for the in&s;truction of youth, after being revi&s;ed and approved by a committee of the convocation.</P>
<P>The Popi&s;h partizans object very un|rea&s;onably again&s;t &s;uch <HI>confe&s;&s;ions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="inter">Remarks on eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils.</NOTE> made in provincial councils, arrogating to the Pope the calling of general councils, the pre&s;idency thereof, and even a &s;uperiority over them; choo&s;ing to have every thing of that nature determined in a&s;&s;emblies &s;ubject to the Pontiff's influence, and making his dictates the rule of their deci&s;ions in all points of doctrine. That this hath been the ca&s;e in mo&s;t general councils for &s;even hundred years pa&s;t, is too notorious to be denied: but, to confine matters of
<PB N="153" REF="164">faith to &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, is contrary to the practice of the Chri&s;tian church in all ages; from which it appears, that, for one here&s;y cen&s;ured in general councils, there have been an hundred condemned in provincial and national &s;ynods. The primitive church was governed, and all determinations in matters of faith, for the fir&s;t three centuries, by provincial &s;ynods only; and a ge|neral council was not &s;o much as known, till, the em|pire becoming Chri&s;tian, the council of Nice was call|ed by the Emperor Con&s;tantine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 40 of vol. i. of this work.</NOTE>. This, being com|po&s;ed of Bi&s;hops, deputed by their colleagues in every province of the empire, and qualified to atte&s;t the doc|trines received in each, was more truly general than any which has been &s;ince honoured with that title; &s;carce any one whereof was compo&s;ed of the like exten|&s;ive repre&s;entation, or equally free in its proceedings. It is not the number of Bi&s;hops that makes a council general; it cannot be &s;o, but by a general deputation from all provincial or national churches; what gives force to its decrees, is the reception thereof by &s;uch churches; and what di&s;tingui&s;hes the orthodox deci|&s;ions of &s;ome general councils, from the cla&s;hing and heretical ones of others, is the reception of the former, and the rejection of the latter, by particular churches, which compo&s;e the church univer&s;al. It is now, and hath been for many ages, utterly impracticable to a&s;&s;em|ble a council de&s;erving the name of general; the four patriarchates of the ea&s;t being under the dominion of infidels, too jealous to &s;uffer any number of Bi&s;hops of the Greek church to attend at we&s;tern councils: which u&s;ed, by publi&s;hing <HI>croi&s;ades,</HI> to &s;pirit up devout war|riors in infinite numbers to invade their country. Nor is it ea&s;y to a&s;&s;emble a general council of the we&s;tern Bi&s;hops alone, by rea&s;on of the jarring intere&s;ts of Princes, who will not allow their Prelates to go out of their dominions to attend it, when they do not like
<PB N="154" REF="165">the occa&s;ion of its being called, or the influence that directs its proceedings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Further pro|ceedings in the Council of Trent.</NOTE> This is confirmed in the council of Trent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 47 of this volume.</NOTE>, which, after a long &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, renewed its &s;e&s;&s;ions the la&s;t year on May 1; and adjourned to September 1; the French amba&s;&s;ador having entered a prote&s;t, in his ma&s;ter's name, that the King of France (then engaged in a war with the Pope, in behalf of the Duke of Parma) would not &s;end his Bi&s;hops thither, nor ob&s;erve any of its de|crees. The council however proceeded, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French prelates, to make, in the &s;e&s;&s;ions of October 11, and November 25, &s;everal de|crees, relative, as well to what they &s;tiled reformation, as doctrine, with regard to the euchari&s;t, penance, and extreme unction; but in &s;uch a manner, as to procure little re&s;pect to their deci&s;ion, and to &s;hock the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of the Romi&s;h communion. It appears from the letters of Vargas, one of the Emperor's amba&s;&s;a|dors who was at the council, that "Cardinal Cre|&s;centio, and the other legates, would not deviate a jot from the Pope's orders, to &s;ave the world; that nothing could either be propo&s;ed, debated, or defined, but by their con&s;ent, and in &s;uch manner as they di|rected; that they acted in an arbitrary, over-bearing, imperious, and, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, in a brutal man|ner, abu&s;ing, reviling, and threatening Bi&s;hops, who &s;aid any thing which they did not like; that there was no &s;hadow of liberty, nor the lea&s;t traces of a general council, in all its proceedings, and it could not but end ingloriou&s;ly, leaving the church in a wor&s;e condi|tion than it was in before; that the canons for reform|ing abu&s;es were &s;o trifling, that &s;everal were a&s;hamed to hear them; and, though &s;ome Bi&s;hops called it a pretended reformation, and it was really &s;o infamous, as it would make the council a je&s;t to the world, yet no
<PB N="155" REF="166">other, nor any better order was ever to be expected; the authority of the &s;ee of Rome being &s;aved in all things &s;o, that what the Pope did not like &s;tood for nothing; that, when gro&s;s abu&s;es were com|plained of, the matter was compounded; that which pa&s;&s;ed uncen&s;ured being e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever, and what was cen&s;ured, being ea&s;ily eluded. As to their decrees in matters of doctrine, after hearing the debates of &s;ome &s;chola&s;tic divines on the &s;ubject in particular con|gregations, the legates cooked them up to their own mind; not fini&s;hing them till the night before the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Bi&s;hops knowing nothing of what was to be pa&s;&s;ed till it was ready to be pronounced, many of them neither did nor could under&s;tand the points determined, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed them implicitly, committing &s;uch blunders in &s;ome ca&s;es, that the legates were forced to employ divines to correct decrees after they were pa&s;&s;ed by the council. All was done (as that amba&s;|&s;ador ob&s;erves) by directions from Rome; and nothing el&s;e was to be expected, when a majority of the coun|cil con&s;i&s;ted of the Pope's pen&s;ioners."&mdash;Notwith&s;tand|ing this majority of their own creatures, the legates were not a little embarra&s;&s;ed on &s;ome occa&s;ions. There was nothing they &s;o much dreaded as the coming of Prote&s;tants to the council: and, as well to deter them from that &s;tep, as to have a pretence for not hearing them, in the explanations and defence of their confe&s;|&s;ions of faith, they had, in contempt of the remon|&s;trances of the imperial amba&s;&s;ador, hurried over matters &s;o, as to prejudge them, and to condemn the mo&s;t material articles of tho&s;e confe&s;&s;ions, which, by wre&s;ting them to a perver&s;e &s;en&s;e, they could find a pre|text to cen&s;ure. Joachim, Elector of Brandenburgh, had &s;ent his amba&s;&s;adors to Trent; the Duke of Wir|temberg did the &s;ame; and, at the latter end of the la&s;t year, deputies arrived there from Stra&s;burgh, and five other cities of the empire; being followed, in the beginning of this, by amba&s;&s;adors from Maurice, the
<PB N="156" REF="167">new Elector of Saxony. The&s;e all demanded a revi|&s;ion of what had been done with regard to the contro|verted points, and a &s;afe-conduct for their divines to come and di&s;pute, and defend the doctrines laid down in their own confe&s;&s;ions: but the legates, pur&s;uant to their orders from Rome, re&s;olved not to allow them the liberty of a defence, pretending that there would, in that ca&s;e, be no end of di&s;putes. The in&s;tances of the imperial amba&s;&s;adors, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical electors of the empire, prevailed indeed for a &s;afe-conduct, but not &s;uch a one as the Prote&s;tants de&s;ired, or thought (after the declaration of the council of Con&s;tance, that faith was not to be kept with heretics) a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for their divines. The legates would not grant one more ample: and, being doubtful whether the form, to which they had con&s;ented, might not be ac|cepted, propo&s;ed to fini&s;h their decrees in a &s;e&s;&s;ion or two, and then di&s;&s;olve the council. This re&s;olution could not be executed, without giving abundant occa|&s;ion of clamour to the world: but an unexpected event extricated them out of their difficulties, and afforded them a plau&s;ible pretence, on April 28, to &s;u&s;pend the council.</P>
<P>This was a war which, at that time, broke out in the empire, on the following occa&s;ion. The Emperor, contrary to his word of honour, given to Maurice of Saxony, and the Marquis of Brandenburgh, had de|tained the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e in pri&s;on, which had greatly irritated the&s;e two Princes: nor could the other potentates and &s;tates of the empire &s;ee, with patience, the liberties of Germany invaded, and the freedom of religion de&s;troyed. As there was no probable means of procuring a redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances, but by force, they re&s;olved to take that method: and, making a league with Henry II. King of France, they made preparation for war with all &s;ecre&s;y imaginable. Having a&s;&s;embled their forces on a &s;udden, they came, on April 1, before Aug&s;burgh, and, in two days, made
<PB N="157" REF="168">them&s;elves ma&s;ters of that city. The King of France, having, at the &s;ame time, advanced into Lorrain with a &s;trong body, and declaring, that his only de&s;ign was to a&s;&s;ert the liberties of Germany, which the Emperor meant to en&s;lave, found admittance into the cities of Metz, Toul, Verdun, and advanced as far as Stra&s;burgh. Charles V. though aver&s;e to an ac|commodation, was &s;oon obliged to enter into a treaty with the confederates, and con&s;ent to the pacification, made at Pa&s;&s;au, in the beginning of Augu&s;t. The principal conditions were, "That a diet &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled in &s;ix months, to con&s;ider the mo&s;t ea&s;y and proper means for appea&s;ing all di&s;putes about religion; for which an equal number of pious, prudent, and pa|cific per&s;ons, &s;hould be cho&s;en, on both &s;ides; that in the mean time neither the Emperor, nor any other Prince, &s;hould force the con&s;cience, or put a con&s;traint on the will of any body, in point of religion, nor, by an act of violence, or under pretence of in&s;truc|tion, do any thing to the prejudice, or &s;light, of any per&s;on what&s;oever on the &s;ubject, but &s;uffer all the world to live in peace and tranquillity; that the Princes of the <HI>Aug&s;burgh confe&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;hould not mole&s;t the Romi&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tics or &s;eculars, but let them enjoy their e&s;tates and revenues, and exerci&s;e their juri&s;diction and cere|monies; that the imperial chamber &s;hould do ju&s;tice to to all, without regarding their religion, and the Pro|te&s;tants, having in it the number of &s;eats belonging to them, &s;hould, as well as the parties, who had &s;uits in the court, be at liberty to &s;wear by <HI>God and the &s;aints,</HI> or by <HI>God and the Go&s;pels,</HI> at their option; and, in fine, that, if they could come to no agreement in articles of religion, this agreement &s;hould &s;till con|tinue for ever in its full force and vigour." Thus was the <HI>interim</HI> (formerly mentioned) which had only been executed in a very few places, entirely annulled: the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e was &s;et at liberty, and all diffe|rences in Germany with the Emperor terminated.</P>
<PB N="158" REF="169">
<P>The war &s;till continuing between the Emperor and France, Charles applied to the court of England for a &s;uccour, but in vain. The King had greater rea&s;on to be jealous of the Emperor, than of any other power in Europe, his projects for getting the Prince&s;s Mary out of England, being calculated neither for Edward's advantage, nor for furthering his de&s;igns of reformation in his dominions; for the better carrying on of which, it was very convenient, that he &s;hould be at amity with his neighbours; and accordingly the di&s;putes with Scotland, about the debateable lands on the borders, were &s;ettled, on September 24, by the Lords Wharton and Conyers, Sir T. Wharton, and Sir T. Chaloner, in conjunction with the Scotch com|mi&s;&s;ioners. Thus at peace with all the world, Edward was not diverted from the work he had mo&s;t at heart: and cau&s;ed the common prayer to be tran&s;lated into French, for the u&s;e of the i&s;les of Jer&s;ey and Guern|&s;ey. It was probably not &s;o ea&s;y to find proper per&s;ons capable of tran&s;lating it either into the Wel&s;h or Iri&s;h languages; &s;o that it did not appear in the former, till the 5th of Queen Elizabeth, and, if it hath not been tran&s;lated &s;ince into the latter language, it hath been chiefly owing to the influence the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts &s;till pre&s;erve in Ireland.</P>

Their chief concern was, to keep that country quiet: and with an addi|tional force of 400 men they attained their end &s;ur|pri&s;ingly; there not being any di&s;turbance there during
<PB N="159" REF="170">the whole of this reign. Notwith&s;tanding, the Engli&s;h liturgy was carried over thither; and, without any law in their own parliaments to impo&s;e it, was u&s;ed in mo&s;t churches of the Engli&s;h plantations.

But, if any patent did pa&s;s for his tran&s;|lation, it never took effect, probably thro' the power of the Duke of Northumberland, who aimed at the rich palatinate belonging to this &s;ee; and got an act of parliament, in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, to di&s;&s;olve the bi&s;hopric, and erect, in its &s;tead, two dioce&s;es under two Bi&s;hops, one retaining the old name of Durham, the other denominated from Newca&s;tle; which, virtually, if not expre&s;sly, &s;et a&s;ide Ridley's tran&s;lation.

It was hoped, that $word$ Maje&s;ty's youth, the approaching &s;pring, and prep$$ medicines adapted to his ca&s;e, might, by degrees, get the better of his ma|lady: but it was of too malignant a nature; and grew &s;o fa&s;t upon him, that, when the parliament met in the beginning of March, the Lords and Commons were obliged to attend him at Whitehall, to hear the rea&s;ons of their being convened. Every degree of decay of the King's healti. was a &s;pur to Northumber|land, in taking mea&s;ures for carrying on the &s;chemes he had formed for rai&s;ing his own family to the throne, upon Edward's decea&s;e; he was &s;carce ever ab&s;ent from the &s;ick Prince; and endeavoured by his a&s;&s;iduity, and pretended concern for his health, to get into his affections, as well as con&s;idence, at the &s;ame time that he kept all, but his own creatures, at a di&s;|tance. &mdash;The King, drawing near his end, the weak|ne&s;s of his body, and depre&s;&s;ion of his &s;pirits by a
<PB N="161" REF="172">langui&s;hing &s;ickne&s;s rendering him &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, fears, and apprehen&s;ions, as Northumber|land &s;ugge&s;ted, he was &s;oon per&s;uaded, that he had the &s;ame right of &s;ettling and altering the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, as his father Henry had exerci&s;ed: and as all that had been done by them both, towards a refor|mation, would be &s;et a&s;ide, if the order &s;ettled by Henry's will took place, it was propo&s;ed to him to make an alteration therein. The young Monarch had nothing at heart &s;o much, as the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the reformation: it had been the continual object of his pur&s;uit, in the exerci&s;e of his regal power, and it was the chief &s;ubject of his la&s;t prayer at the moment of his decea&s;e. The danger of its being de&s;troyed, and of the revival of popery, if the Prince&s;s Mary &s;hould mount the throne, was too evident to be di&s;puted: and Edward was &s;ufficiently inclined to prevent &s;o fatal a con&s;equence if it might be done with ju&s;tice; for which, be&s;ides the danger of their marrying foreigners, that would de&s;troy the laws and liberties of the nation, other pretences were not wanting. The&s;e were &s;uch as lay equally again&s;t to Prince&s;s Elizabeth, though no &s;uch danger was apprehended from her: yet, both having once been declared illegitimate, though born <HI>bona fide</HI> in marriage, and afterwards not only capa|citated to &s;ucceed, but actually declared heirs to the crown, in their re&s;pective orders, were on that account both to be excluded. It was further urged, that, if the&s;e Prince&s;&s;es had been really legitimate, and for that rea&s;on natural heirs to their father, yet they were not &s;o to Edward, being his &s;i&s;ters only by the half blood; who, in the ca&s;e of private inheritance, can|not, by the law of England, claim the real e&s;tates of an half brother, whil&s;t any relations of the whole blood remain, as had appeared in a late in&s;tance, upon the decea&s;e of the &s;ons of Charles Brandon. Very likely Edward was not conver&s;ant enough with the law of nations, and the con&s;titution of the kingdom, to know,
<PB N="162" REF="173">that the rule, ob&s;erved in private patrimonies, was very different from the order e&s;tabli&s;hed with regard to crowns de&s;cending by a lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in which the next line a heir hath as much right to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as the King in being hath to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of the crown; and was therefore the more ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, by this pretence, to exclude his half &s;i&s;ters. Henry's will had &s;et a&s;ide the Scotch line: and Mary Queen of Scotland, the heir of his &s;i&s;ter Margaret, being affianced to the Dauphin, there was room for the &s;ame apprehen|&s;ions on the &s;core of religion from that quarter, as were entertained with regard to the Prince&s;s Mary; be|&s;ides the manife&s;t danger of England's becoming a pro|vince to the more powerful kingdom of France. All the&s;e circum&s;tances concurring to favour Northum|berland's &s;cheme, no body being &s;uffered to approach Edward, but &s;uch as were &s;ure to promote it, and Frances Duche&s;s of Suffolk, the next heir of the line of Mary, younger &s;i&s;ter of Henry VIII. devolving all her right upon her elde&s;t daughter, the King was pre|vailed with to appoint his cou&s;in the Lady Jane Grey his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. &mdash; Sir Edward Montague, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, and two other Judges, Sir Thomas Bromley, and Sir John Baker, with the Attorney-General, and Solicitor General, were &s;ent for to the Council, the King being pre&s;ent; and the mi|nute of the intended &s;ettlement of the crown being read, they were ordered to draw it up in the form of a patent. They ob&s;erved, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion being &s;ettled by act of parliament, could not be altered in any other manner: and when this objection did not prevent the order's being renewed, they de&s;ired time to con&s;ider of the matter. Upon examining the &s;tatute of $word$ Edward VI. of trea&s;ons, they found it to be trea&s;on, not only after the King's death, but even in his lifetime, to alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: and, when they came again before the council, declared, it could not be done, becau&s;e it was trea&s;onable, and all the Lords,
<PB N="163" REF="174">that &s;hould concur in it, would be guilty of trea&s;on. Northumberland was in a violent pa&s;&s;ion at this decla|ration; called Montague a traytor, and threatened the other Judges: but they per&s;i&s;ted in their opinion. They were &s;ent for again on June 15, and, Go&s;nold coming with them, the King a&s;ked them a little roughly, why they had not prepared the &s;ettlement? Upon their ur|ging, that whatever they did would be of no force with|out a parliament, the King &s;aid he would call one &s;oon: and, when they propo&s;ed to delay it till then, he told them, he would have it fir&s;t drawn, in order afterwards to have it ratified by parliament; and required them upon their allegiance to &s;et about it immediately. They were at la&s;t brought to comply, partly by threats, and partly by their being granted, at their reque&s;t, a &s;pecial com|mi&s;&s;ion to make the draught, and a pardon after it was fini&s;hed. When the form of the entail was drawn, and brought to the Chancellor (Thomas Goodrich Bi&s;hop of Ely) for the great &s;eal, all the judges were required to put their hands to it, and only Go&s;nold and Sir James Hales refu&s;ed: the former, however, complied after|wards, but the latter, though zealous for the reforma|tion, would not con&s;ent to do it, on any con&s;ideration. The Chancellor then, for his own &s;ecurity, in&s;i&s;ted that all the Lords of the council &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;et their hands to the in&s;trument; which was accordingly &s;igned on June 21, by thirty-three per&s;ons in all, in|cluding the Judges. Archbi&s;hop Cranmer was not there; and when it was propo&s;ed to him, refu&s;ed to &s;ign: nor could any arguments per&s;uade him to the di&s;inheriting of his late ma&s;ter's daughters, till they got the King to conjure him, not to &s;tand out &s;ingly again&s;t his will, and engage him, upon the opinion of the Judges, that it was legal, to &s;et his hand to it.</P>
<P>Edward had but a &s;hort time to live,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The King's mu|nificence to the city of London.</NOTE> when the great &s;eal was put to this &s;ettlement: but, before he died, he had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing &s;ome charitable founda|tions, which he had de&s;igned for &s;ome time, fully
<PB N="164" REF="175">&s;ettled. Va&s;t &s;warms of beggars and nece&s;&s;itous people were continually &s;trolling about the &s;treets of London, &s;ince the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries: and Bi&s;hop Ridley, in a &s;ermon, preached the la&s;t year before the King, had earne&s;tly recommended the &s;ettling of &s;ome con|&s;tant method for their relief. Edward, much affected with what he had heard, &s;ent for the prelate; gave him thanks for his good exhortation; and, di&s;cour&s;ing with him about the proper methods of bringing about &s;o good a work, it was thought advi&s;eable to con&s;ult the Lord Mayor and Aldermen on the &s;ubject. In con&s;equence hereof, a general contribution was made in the city, towards preparing and furni&s;hing the ho&s;pitals of Chri&s;t-church, and of St. Thomas in Southwark, the &s;cites whereof, with the lands and the revenues of the di&s;&s;olved priories of Little St. Bartholomew and St. Thomas, had been given by Henry VIII. before his death, to the city: but nothing had been done to fit them up for the purpo&s;e intended. A &s;ub&s;cription was now opened for a weekly contribution towards the maintenance of the&s;e ho&s;pitals, till they &s;hould be better endowed: and &s;ome of the citizens contributed very generou&s;ly to both the&s;e charitable undertakings. The decayed buildings in both places were thereupon re|paired; and the work carried on with &s;o much dili|gence, that, on November 23, a great number of &s;ick and maimed people were taken into St. Thomas's ho&s;|pital, and no le&s;s than 400 children put into Chri&s;t's ho&s;pital; all of them to be cloathed, lodged, and &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, at the charge of the city, till other means could be provided for their future maintenance. The King, delighted with the forward liberality of the citizens, &s;ent for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, on April to, and gave for ever his palace of Bridewell (erected by Henry VIII.) to the city, to be employed for the relief of &s;uch vagabonds, and thriftle&s;s poor, as &s;hould be &s;ent thither to receive cha&s;ti&s;ement, and be kept to labour. The ho&s;pital, founded in the Savoy by Henry VII. for the relief of travellers and pilgrims, had
<PB N="165" REF="176">of late been made a harbour for idle fellows, vaga|bonds and &s;trumpets: and the ma&s;ter and brethren, being thereupon &s;ent for to the King, were per&s;uaded to re&s;ign it into his hands, with all its goods, lands and revenues. His Maje&s;ty, immediately upon this &s;ur|render, a&s;&s;igned a yearly rent 7000 marks, with the beds, bedding, and other furniture, towards the maintenance of the work-hou&s;e of Bridewell, and the ho&s;pital of St. Thomas. The letters-patent confirm|ing this grant, with a licence of <HI>mortmain,</HI> for enabling the city to purcha&s;e lands to the amount of 4000 marks a-year, for the &s;upport of tho&s;e and other ho&s;|pitals, were pa&s;&s;ed on June 26.</P>
<P>Some people ob&s;erved, that,<NOTE PLACE="inter">King Ed|ward's death.</NOTE> after the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Edward de|cayed more vi&s;ibly than he did before. A woman, who could give no account of the nature of the di&s;|temper, nor would declare the means &s;he propo&s;ed to u&s;e, undertook to re&s;tore him, in a very &s;hort time, to his former health: and the phy&s;icians were, by Nor|thumberland's advice, and an order of council, di&s;|charged, till &s;he had tried the effects of her medicines. The u&s;e of them &s;oon brought upon the King a difficulty of &s;peech and breathing; his legs &s;welled, his pul&s;e failed, and his &s;kin changed colour, with many other horrid &s;ymptoms of approaching death. This being ob&s;erved, the phy&s;icians were &s;ent for again, when it was too late, being called in purely for form &s;ake, that it might not be &s;aid, a King had died without the attendance of his phy&s;icians: and &s;ome of them whi&s;pered in &s;ecret, "that neither their advice nor applications had been at all regarded, in the cour&s;e of his &s;ickne&s;s; that he had been ill-treated &s;everal times; and when, by the bene|fit of youth, and the effect of proper medecines, there was fair hopes of his recovery. he was again more &s;trongly overlaid than ever." Such &s;udden turns often happen in con&s;umptive ca&s;es: and yet Dr. Heylin quotes a popi&s;h writer, affirming, that the apothecary,
<PB N="166" REF="177">who poi&s;oned him, drowned him&s;elf &s;oon after, out of the horror of his crime, and the remor&s;e of his con|&s;cience; and that the laundre&s;s, who wa&s;hed his &s;hirts, lo&s;t the &s;kin of her fingers. However this was (and, if Edward had been poi&s;oned, &s;ome mark of it mu&s;t have appeared, when his body was opened to be em|balmed) the people in general imputed his death to the Duke of Northumberland, and broke out into mo&s;t violent exclamations again&s;t him; maintaining, that it had been his view, in getting the King's two uncles put to death, in di&s;gracing, and removing from court, the mo&s;t faithful of his nobility and council, and placing about his per&s;on &s;uch as were ready to perpetrate any wickedne&s;s that they &s;hould be de&s;ired to commit. Northumberland, &s;lighting the&s;e clamours, proceeded in his mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the crown to his own fa|mily; but, as Providence often infatuates the mo&s;t crafty politicians, he took the mo&s;t important of them too late for his purpo&s;e. This was the getting of the two rightful heirs into his hands; for having engaged the King or the Lords of the council in his name, to write a letter to his &s;i&s;ters, inviting them to court, to bear him company during his illne&s;s, they began their journeys; but, before their arrival, Edward died at Greenwich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His corp&s;e remained there till Augu&s;t 8; and, being then removed to We&s;tmin&s;ter, was buried the next day in the abbey-church; the Marquis of Winche&s;ter, Lord Trea&s;urer, attending it as chief mourner, with twelve other mourners, &s;ix of them Earls, and &s;ix Barons. Day, the late Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, preached the funeral-&s;ermon: but the burial-&s;ervice was read in Engli&s;h by Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, who, at the &s;ame time, admini&s;tered the communion. At this mournful &s;o|lemity, to which no amba&s;&s;ador was invited, and few of the nobility attended, an univer&s;al dejection prevailed, and &s;uch tokens of real grief were expre&s;&s;ed by all ranks of people, as had &s;carce ever been known on the like occa&s;ion.</NOTE>, on July 6, towards night, in the &s;ix|teenth year of his age, and the &s;eventh of his reign.</P>

<PB N="167" REF="178">his temper, quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and an ad|mirable under&s;tanding, cultivated and improved by &s;tudy and reflection to an amazing degree. His favour to men of learning is univer&s;ally acknowledged: one of the mo&s;t eminent of that age, Jerome Cardan, an Italian phy&s;ician and a Roman Catholic, who, in his return from Scotland, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in the Engli&s;h court, the year before Edward's death, and conver&s;ed frequently with him on matters of &s;cience, gives him a character, which in an Engli&s;h writer might look like flattery or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. "There was in him (&s;ays Jerome) a towardly di&s;po&s;ition and pregnancy, qualifying him for all human literature, &s;o that, whil&s;t a child, he was ma&s;ter of &s;everal languages, be&s;ides his native Engli&s;h. He was &s;ingularly perfect in the French and Latin tongues; and under&s;tood the Greek, Italian, and Spani&s;h, having the like facility for re|ceiving all others: nor was he un&s;killed in mu&s;ic, lo|gic, and the principles of natural philo&s;ophy. He did not want either humanity, princely gravity and maje&s;ty, or any other accompli&s;hment becoming a noble King. In a word, it might &s;eem a miracle in na|ture to behold the excellent wit and genius that ap|peared in him, being yet a child: and this (&s;ays he) I do not &s;peak rhetorically to magnify matters beyond the truth, for the truth really &s;urpa&s;&s;es what I here declare" He was a&s;&s;iduous to inform him&s;elf of every thing that concerned the commerce and intere&s;t of his country, and under&s;tood foreign affairs very well, con|&s;idering his years. He made u&s;eful regulations for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s in his council, and kept a jour|nal of all that pa&s;&s;ed in it. He was very careful to pay his debts, and maintain his credit; and would, in all probability, have made an excellent oeconomi&s;t, if he had lived to take the reins of government into his own hands.

<P>A. D. 1553 THE Duke of Northumberland endea|voured to conceal the death of Edward VI. in hopes of getting the two di&s;inherited Prince&s;&s;es into his hands, and in order to take effectual mea&s;ures for publi&s;hing the late King's will, and &s;ettling the Lady Jane Grey on the throne, without di&s;turbance. But as it was known by all the Lords of the council (&s;ome whereof were ill-affected to the Duke, though they had crouch|ed under his power) it could not be long a &s;ecret to the world: and the melancholy event began in two days to be whi&s;pered about London. The Duke then thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end for the Lord Mayor, &s;ix Aldermen, and twelve of the principal citizens to
<PB N="169" REF="180">Greenwich, to acquaint them with his Maje&s;ty's de|cea&s;e, and the will he had made for &s;ettling the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. The patent under the great &s;eal, containing the di&s;po&s;ition in favour of the Lady Jane, was &s;hewed them: and, after being obliged by promi&s;es and threats to take the oaths to her, they were &s;trictly charged, un|der &s;evere penalties, not to divulge the matter. Jane was at Sion hou&s;e, in Middle&s;ex, when Northumber|land, Northampton, Arundel, Hunting|don,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Lady Jane Grey pro|claimed.</NOTE> and Pembroke, approached her on their knees, with &s;uch marks of re&s;pect and ceremony, as threw her into the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. When &s;he was acquainted with her de|&s;ignation to the throne, &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears; nor could all the intreaties of her friends, parents, re|lations, and hu&s;band, prevail with her, for &s;ome time, to accept the proffered crown. Her con&s;ent being at la&s;t extorted, &s;he was conducted, on July 10, to the Tower of London; pre&s;ented in form with the keys at her entrance, and proclaimed Queen, that evening, in different parts of the city. The Prince&s;s Mary had come as far as Hodde&s;don in Hert&s;ord&s;hire, when &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from Henry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, informing her of the King's death, and the &s;teps taken to exclude her from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She immediately retired to Kenning-hall in Norfolk, and wrote thence, on July 8, to Sir George Somer&s;et, Sir W. Drury, Sir W. Waldegrave, and Clement Hig|ham, requiring their immediate attendance, with what forces they could rai&s;e. Circular letters were di&s;patch|ed to all the nobility and magi&s;trates of the principal towns, putting them in mind of her right, and com|manding them to proclaim her without delay. Then &s;he wrote to the council, expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urpri&s;e, that, as they knew her undoubted right to the crown, they had not informed her of her brother's demi&s;e; and pro|mi&s;ing to take them into favour, upon recognizing her title, and proclaiming her in London, and other
<PB N="170" REF="181">places, according to their duty. Having taken the&s;e mea&s;ures, &s;he removed to Framlingham ca&s;tle in Suf|folk, that, in ca&s;e of being hard pre&s;&s;ed, &s;he might be near the &s;ea to make her e&s;cape to Flanders. The fir&s;t noblemen who joined her were John Bourchier Earl of Bath, and Henry Ratcliffe Earl of Su&s;&s;ex; Sir T. Wharton, Sir J. Mordaunt, Sir H. Bidingfield, Sir W. Drury, and other gentlemen of figure, joining them, made up a force, which began to be formidable. The council at London &s;ent an an&s;wer to her letter, im|porting, that as &s;he was the fruit of an unlawful mar|riage, formally di&s;&s;olved by act of parliament, &s;he ought to drop her preten&s;ions, and acknowledge the &s;overeignty of Queen Jane, who had mounted the throne by virtue of the late King's letters-patent: and having received advice of the unexpected event in fa|vour of Mary, on July 12, ordered the forces, which they had in readine&s;s, to march to Newmarket, under the command of the Duke of Northumberland. The hopes of being able to do &s;omething, in Dudley's ab|&s;ence, in favour of Mary, made &s;ome of the Lords prevail on him to accept the command; and, though he complied, it was not without &s;ome jealou&s;y of their de&s;igns. However, before he &s;et out, he in&s;tructed the Duke of Suffolk to detain the coun&s;ellors in the Tower, on pretence of conforming to the practice of the Engli&s;h &s;overeigns, who, with their council, u&s;ed to re&s;ide there, on their acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Prince&s;s Mary was pro|claimed at Norwich,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Mary proclaimed in the country,</NOTE> which city &s;ent a body of men, with ammunition, to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and &s;he had been reinforced by the Lord Thomas Howard, &s;on to the Duke of Norlolk, with the friends and followers of the Howard family, very numerous in that country. Upon the fir&s;t news of Northumberland's march, Mary was advi&s;ed, by &s;ome about her, to retire a|broad;
<PB N="171" REF="182">and had he advanced immediately again&s;t her, &s;he might probably have taken that &s;tep; in which ca&s;e &s;he would hardly have found friends to introduce her back to England. In&s;tead of acting with the ne|ce&s;&s;ary vigour, re&s;olution, and di&s;patch, he loitered away his time &s;ome days at Cambridge; and, not find|ing the &s;upplies he expected from the council on his arrival at Bury, he retired back to that place. He was now under a nece&s;&s;ity of waiting for &s;uccours from London; and he wrote to the council in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms for a reinforcement: but, though they offered eight crowns a month, be&s;ides &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to every volunteer that would inli&s;t, &s;uch was the general odium again&s;t Northumberland, that few would en|gage, even on the&s;e terms; while people crowded to the banners of Mary, and maintained them&s;elves at their own expence; in&s;omuch that her army &s;oon amounted to 14,000 men, and many a&s;&s;i&s;ted her with money, plate, and jewels.</P>
<P>The time was favourable for the Earls of Pembroke and Arundel,<NOTE PLACE="inter">and in London.</NOTE> and the other enemies of North|umberland, to take mea&s;ures for his de&s;truction. The two Earls, finding them&s;elves re&s;tricted and watched by Suffolk, took an opportunity, from the Duke of Northumberland's pre&s;&s;ing letters, to pro|po&s;e, that, as the French amba&s;&s;ador was aver&s;e to enter the Tower, they &s;hould meet him at Baynard's ca&s;tle, a hou&s;e belonging to the Earl of Pembroke in the city, where they might confer with him, and con|cert mea&s;ures for bringing over a body of troops for the &s;ervice of Jane. Suffolk a&s;&s;enting, they invited to the place all the noblemen about London who were thought to be in Mary's intere&s;t: and when they met, the Earl of Arundel made a &s;peech, inveighing bitterly again&s;t Northumberland, and his de&s;igns, in the ex|altation of Jane, which, he affirmed, was only to &s;erve his own private views, though &s;hamefully cloathed with the &s;pecious pretence of religion: and moved, that Mary
<PB N="172" REF="183">might be proclaimed Queen of England. Arundel's harangue was no &s;ooner fini&s;ned, than Pembroke de|clared his approbation of the motion: and, clapping his hand upon his &s;word, &s;ignified his re&s;olution to de|fend the Lady Mary's cau&s;e again&s;t all opponents. Some of the Lords propo&s;ed, their fir&s;t adverti&s;ing the Duke of Northumberland, whom they had all engaged to &s;upport, and to treat in common for a pardon: but, a majority being again&s;t all delays, a proclamation was drawn up and &s;igned by all pre&s;ent. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen, being acquainted with the re|&s;olution, came and joined them; and the whole body, mounted on hor&s;eback rode through St. Paul's church|yard to the cro&s;s in Cheap&s;ide, where Mary was pro|claimed Queen, by Sir Chri&s;topher Barker, principal King at arms, on July 19, about four in the after|noon. The Earl of Arundel and Lord Paget were di&s;patched to Framlingham ca&s;tle, to acquaint her Maje&s;ty with the&s;e proceedings: and &s;ome companies were &s;ent to &s;ecure the Tower, which was the ea&s;ier done, as Pembroke had 150 of the guards at his de|votion. Jane re&s;igned the parade of royalty, with more &s;atisfaction than &s;he had received it: and retired, with her mother, to their own habitations. The Duke of Suffolk, joining the other Lords, with Arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer, Chancellor Goodrich, the Marquis of Winche&s;ter, and the re&s;t of the council, &s;ent in|&s;tructions to the Duke of Northumberland, to di&s;band his forces, and behave like a duti&s;ul &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Some private friends having informed him of the&s;e proceedings at London, the Duke had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his forces, then reduced to a &s;mall number by de&s;ertion, and intended to quit the kingdom: but being prevented by the band of pen&s;ioners, who in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;tay|ing to ju&s;tify their proceedings, he endeavoured to re|commend him&s;elf to Mary, by proclaiming her Queen at the market-place in Cambridge, on July 20, when he threw up his cap in token of joy, and &s;hewed other
<PB N="173" REF="184">feigned demon&s;trations of his zeal. The Earl of Arundel arriving next morning, and arre&s;ting him in the Queen's name, he fell down at his feet, and abjectly &s;ued for his favour; but was treated by him, with a retaliation of the pride and in&s;olence Arundel had formerly re|ceived from him. On July 25, he was committed to the Tower<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the way thither a woman &s;hewed him a handkerchief which &s;he had dipped in the blood of the Duke of Somer&s;et; and up|braided him as being the cau&s;e of that nobleman's ruin.</NOTE>, with the Earls of Warwick and Hun|tingdon, the Lords Ha&s;tings, Ambro&s;e and Henry Dudley, Sir Andrew Dudley, Sir John and Sir Henry Gates, Sir T.

The&s;e were followed the next day by the Marquis of Northampton, the Lord Ro|bert Dudley, Sir Robert Corbet, and Bi&s;hop Ridley; the offence of this la&s;t being a &s;ermon which he preach|ed, on the 16th, at St. Paul's cro&s;s, maintaining Jane's title to the crown, according to the late King's &s;ettlement, and &s;etting forth Mary's ob&s;tinacy in ad|hering to the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions, with the mi&s;chiefs her acce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t bring on the nation, by &s;ubjecting it to a foreign power, and &s;ubverting the true reli|gion.</P>
<P>Upon the revolution at London, and the di&s;a&s;ter of Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Mary enters London in triumph.</NOTE> Mary di&s;banded her army at Framlingham, and began her march to London, which &s;he entered in triumph, on Augu&s;t 3, attended by her &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, who had joined her on the road with 1000 hor&s;e rai&s;ed for her &s;ervice. She proceeded im|mediately to the Tower, and &s;oon after her arrival there &s;et at liberty the Duke of Norfolk, the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, and other &s;tate-pri&s;oners, eccle&s;ia&s;tics and laics. Thus Mary became mi&s;tre&s;s of the realm with|out a drop of blood, notwith&s;tanding her rival had
<PB N="174" REF="185">been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the forts, the magazines, the trea|&s;ure, the civil power, the navy, and the regular mi|litary force of the realm: from whence Bi&s;hop Good|win takes occa&s;ion to celebrate the attachment of the Engli&s;h to the heir of blood, in oppo&s;ition to an u&s;ur|ped authority. As the Londoners had been very zea|lous in Mary's cau&s;e, &s;he di&s;tributed 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a piece to every poor hou&s;e-keeper among them. On Aug. 20, &s;he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation touching a redre&s;s of the in|conveniences ari&s;ing from the currency of bad money: and another, on Sept. 1, remitting a &s;ub&s;idy of 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in the pound on lands, and 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> on goods, payable in two years, granted to the late King by his la&s;t par|liament.</P>
<P>The Duke of Northumberland had been the au|thor, contriver,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Duke of Nortlum|berland condemned, and beheaded.</NOTE> and abetter, of the late u&s;urpation: and as he well|de&s;erved death on that account, he was too dangerous a man to be &s;uffered to live under a Queen, who knew that her mea&s;ures would &s;oon create a general di&s;content among the people. Being brought to his trial, on Aug. 18, the Duke of Norfolk acting as High Steward, he de|&s;ired to know, whether a man, acting by orders under the great &s;eal, could be ju&s;tly charged with trea&s;on? and whether tho&s;e, who were at lea&s;t equally culpable, could &s;it as judges? Norfolk replied, that the great &s;eal of an u&s;urper could be no warrant; and that any per&s;on, again&s;t whom there was nothing upon record, was reputed in law capable of &s;itting on any trial. From this la&s;t an&s;wer, Northumberland fore&s;aw that any ob|jection he could make would be over-ruled; he there|fore confe&s;&s;ed the indictment, and threw him&s;elf on the Queen's mercy; for which he al&s;o petitioned his judges to be mediators with her Maje&s;ty to his &s;ons, who had taken arms in obedience to his command. The Marquis of Northampton, and the Earl of Warwick (the Duke's elde&s;t &s;on) being arraigned at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="175" REF="186">pleaded guilty; and all three received &s;entence, as in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on. The &s;ame judgment was pro|hounced, the next day, upon Sir John and Sir Henry Gates, Sir Andrew Dudley the Duke's brother, and Sir T. Palmer; who all pleading guilty, &s;ubmitted to the Queen's mercy. On Tue&s;day, Augu&s;t 22, Nor|thumberland was brought to the &s;caffold on Tower-hill, where he acknowledged that he had been always a Roman Catholic in his heart, and expre&s;&s;ed great &s;or|row for having plundered the effects of the church, e&s;pecially as he had it not in his power to make re&s;ti|tution. He is &s;aid to have been amu&s;ed with a pro|mi&s;e of pardon, in con&s;equence of which he made this confe&s;&s;ion, which the Romani&s;ts publi&s;hed abroad with great exultation. With him Sir John Gates and Sir T. Palmer were brought to the block, the re&s;t of them being reprieved, and afterwards pardoned.</P>
<P>The noblemen, who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves in the Queen's behalf,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen rewards &s;ome of her friends.</NOTE> expected ber re|compen&s;ing their &s;ervice: nor was &s;he unmindful of &s;ome of them. The Earl of Arundel was con&s;tituted &s;teward of the hou&s;e|hold. The Earl of Su&s;&s;ex was created Knight of the Garter, having al&s;o a privilege granted him, for being, after the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion, covered in her pre|&s;ence; and the Lord Paget was, in a very honourable manner, re&s;tored to the &s;ame order, of which he had been deprived in the former reign by Northumber|land's means. Sir Edward Ha&s;tings was made Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, had a grant of the manors of Bo&s;worth in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and of Michelcherke in Somer&s;et; and was afterwards advanced to the title of Lord Ha|&s;tings of Loughborough. Sir Henry Jernegan was appointed captain of the guard; and Sir Thomas Tre&s;ham was created Lord Prior of the order of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, which was now revived<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 19 of this volume.</NOTE>. Seve|ral
<PB N="176" REF="187">others were rewarded, at the &s;ame time, with pla|ces and pen&s;ions; but it doth not appear that any re|wards were given to the Earl of Bath, Sir John Mor|daunt, or Sir Thomas Wharton, though they were the fir&s;t noblemen that joined her. The wor&s;t cir|cum&s;tance in the choice of her great officers and coun|cil was, that &s;carce any of them were eminent for ta|lents to qualify them for affairs of government; which, through that defect, fell entirely under the manage|ment of Gardiner (who was now relea&s;ed from his confinement) and Paget. Gardiner having the great &s;eal delivered to him on Augu&s;t 23, was, on Septem|ber 26, created Lord Chancellor, and &s;hewed him&s;elf full as arrogant and violent in his admini&s;tration as the mo&s;t arbitrary of his predece&s;&s;ors in power.</P>
<P>A change of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of religious affairs was what Mary pretended to have mo&s;t at heart;<NOTE PLACE="inter">She deprives Bi|&s;hops by her own authority.</NOTE> and, to allure the Bi&s;hops to come into her mea&s;ures, &s;he had declared her re&s;olution of re&s;toring all the lands and manors which had been taken away from their &s;ees. Some of them, flattered with the expectation, complied: but as there was little hopes of prevailing with the major part, more violent methods were to be taken with &s;uch as adhered firmly to the Reformation. Bonner was, on Augu&s;t 5, rein&s;tated in the &s;ee of London, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Bi&s;hop's palace, exerci&s;ed the epi&s;copal authority, and, on the 27th of that month, revived the ma&s;s, and all the Roman La|tin offices, in his cathedral. This was done on the pretence of the &s;ee's being vacant by Ridley's tran&s;la|tion to Durham, though no patent had ever pa&s;&s;ed for his tran&s;lation; and he had in June, a little before $d|ward's death, &s;ent, as Bi&s;hop of London, and Dean of the province, the Archbi&s;hop's writ to the other Bi&s;hops for &s;ummoning a convocation to meet in Sep|tember, concurrent with a parliament, which was to have convened at the &s;ame time, to confirm that
<PB N="177" REF="188">Prince's &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The bi&s;hopric of Durham was di&s;&s;olved by act of parliament; and the &s;uppo&s;ition that it was filled by Ridley (whom on other occa&s;ions they &s;tile Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter) &s;erved for a pretence to re&s;tore Ton&s;tal to it, upon the other's deprivation for here&s;y and &s;edition, as is mentioned in the regi&s;ter. But the&s;e &s;eem to have been pretences found out afterwards to glo&s;s over what had been done irregularly at fir&s;t; for all writers agree, that both Bonner and Ton&s;tal were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ees on Augu&s;t 5; and the commi&s;&s;ion of delegates for hearing the former's new appeal (that which he had made in the late reign having been pronounced in&s;uf|ficient) did not bear date till the 22d of that month, and &s;entence was not given on it till the beginning of September; that for rehearing Ton&s;tal's cau&s;e is not dated. Hooper was actually Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, as Poynet was of Winche&s;ter, and Scory of Chiche&s;ter; yet, without any legal proce&s;s, or deprivation of the parties, Heath, Gardiner, and Day, were immedi|ately re&s;tored to tho&s;e &s;ees; as Ve&s;ey was, on Septem|ber 28, to that of Exeter, which he, being 87 years old, had formerly re&s;igned.</P>

Martyr (who had been a&s;per&s;ed as unlearned) and a few others, whom he would chu&s;e, to defend, in a public di&s;putation, the liturgy, doctrines, and every part of the reforma|tion under the late King, as agreeable to tho&s;e of the primitive church, and warranted by the holy &s;criptures. He propo&s;ed to enlarge, and put his own &s;eal to it,
<PB N="178" REF="189">and then to have it fixed on the doors of St. Paul's, and other churches in London: but a foul draught<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was to this purport.&mdash; "As the devil is a liar, and the father of lying, &s;o he has now &s;tirred up his &s;ervants to per&s;ecute Chri&s;t and his true religion.

To bring this more ea&s;ily about, &s;ome people have abu&s;ed my name, and &s;pread a &s;tory, as if I had &s;et up the ma&s;s at Canterbury, and that I bad offered to &s;ay ma&s;s before the Queen at St. Paul's, and el&s;ewhere.
<P>The Archbi&s;hop denies the fact, prote&s;ts again&s;t every part of the &s;tory; as a downright calumny, and, with the Queen's leave, offers to ju&s;tify the Engli&s;h communion-&s;ervice, both from the authority of the Scriptures, and the practice of the primitive church; and, on the other &s;ide, that the ma&s;s is not only without foundation in both the&s;e re&s;pects, but likewi&s;e di&s;covers a plain contradiction to anti|quity and the in&s;pired writings, and is &s;tuffad over and above with many horrid bla&s;phemies.

The conditions required by the Archbi&s;hop, in the di&s;|pute, are there. That God's word may be the judge, and that the arguments on both &s;ides may be put in writing; that the world may examine the force of what is alledged, and that neither party may have an opportunity of denying their assertions."</P></NOTE> thereof getting abroad, &s;ome of the copies of it were brought to the council; by who&s;e order he was, on September 14, committed pri&s;oner to the Tower. As he had been him&s;elf remarkable for doing beneficent offices for divers per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s, he found &s;ome friends in his own; and &s;everal of the mo&s;t moderate in the council thought it would be puni&s;hment &s;uffi|cient to deprive him of his &s;ee, and a&s;&s;ign him a com|petent maintenance, upon his exhibiting a true inven|tory of all his e&s;tate, with an injunction to keep his hou&s;e, without meddling in matters of religion. He
<PB N="179" REF="190">had interpo&s;ed, even in the Queen's behalf, with her father, to mitigate his anger, when he was proceeding to extremities again&s;t her for adhering ob&s;tinately to her mother; and neither the Duke of Norfolk, nor Gardiner, nor any one el&s;e, dur&s;t &s;peak to him to &s;ave her from being &s;ent to the Tower: but &s;he could ne|ver forgive him the divorce of her mother; and was confirmed in the&s;e implacable &s;entiments by Gardiner and Bonner, who yet had gone greater lengths than he, in every part of the pro&s;ecution of that affair, ex|cept only in pronouncing the &s;entence. Nothing but his death would appea&s;e her re&s;entment: but there was &s;ome difficulty to determine, upon what capital crime he &s;hould be condemned. It &s;eemed hard to charge him with &s;igning the &s;ettlement, which ex|cluded the Queen from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as he was the la&s;t per&s;on that &s;igned it; and the council would not care to make that a capital crime in him, of which they had been all at lea&s;t equally guilty. The &s;angui|nary laws of Henry IV. and V. again&s;t heretics, and the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles under Henry VIII. had been repealed; and, in defect of any other means, it was re&s;olved to convict him fir&s;t of trea&s;on, and then keep him in pri&s;on, till the laws again&s;t here&s;y were revived, when he might be pro&s;ecuted and burnt upon that account. To pave the way for his trial, Gardi|ner, who had the penning of all the acts that pa&s;&s;ed in the approaching &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, thru&s;t into two of them certain clau&s;es, charging the Archbi&s;hop with being the chief con&s;pirator, with the Duke of Northum|berland, in contriving the Queen's exclu&s;ion, though every body knew the contrary. Accordingly, on No|vember 13, Cranmer was tried and condemned of trea|&s;on, with the Lady Jane, and her hu&s;band Lord Guil|ford Dudley, with his brother Lord Ambro&s;e; and the &s;ee of Canterbury becoming vacant by his attain|der, the Dean and Chapter a&s;&s;umed the admini&s;tration of its &s;piritualities, as u&s;ual in other vacancies. Hol|gate,
<PB N="180" REF="191">Archbi&s;hop of York, had not been concerned in any of the tran&s;actions relating to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but he was committed, on October 4, to the Tower, tho' it doth not appear upon what pretence he was impri|&s;oned. He was deprived, in March following, for being married, and detained in cu&s;tody till January 18, 1555, when he was &s;et at liberty at King Philip's in|terce&s;&s;ion; about a year after which he died, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, of grief, his hou&s;es having been plundered, during his confinement, to the amount of &s;everal thou|&s;and pounds in money, plate, jewels, &s;tores, and fur|niture, and even the manor of Scroby &s;eized, which he had bought of the crown, and &s;ettled, after his own and wife's decea&s;e, upon the &s;ee of York.</P>
<P>Such of the deans, dignitaries, and parochial cler|gy, as had been deprived by law,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The reformed cler|gy deprived.</NOTE> in the late reign, for non-conformity, were again re&s;tored to their benefices, and the legal proprietors expelled by force, under co|lour of the Queen's authority, without any legal pro|ceedings. Dr. Cox, Dean of Chri&s;t church in Ox|ford, and of We&s;tmin&s;ter, was turned out to make room for Dr. Richard Mar&s;hall, who &s;ucceeded him in the former, and Dr. Hugh We&s;ton, who &s;upplant|ed him in the latter dignity. Thus the Queen, in the month of October alone, pre&s;ented 256 livings, not above one whereof appears to have been vacant by death: and it is not unlikely that private per&s;ons fol|lowed her example. The laws again&s;t the ma&s;s and Roman offices were &s;till in force; but no body could make their court to the government more effectually, than by reviving the&s;e forbidden &s;ervices; and great encouragement was given to this irregularity. On Friday, Augu&s;t 11, a prie&s;t &s;inging ma&s;s in a church in the hor&s;e-market at London, a great di&s;turbance en&s;ued; and the Lord Mayor complaining thereof, and telling the Queen, that greater tumults would ari&s;e, if a &s;top was not put to that illegal practice, &s;he re&s;ent|ed
<PB N="181" REF="192">it highly. The prie&s;t, indeed, to quiet matters, was taken up, though di&s;mi&s;&s;ed immediately; and the Queen next day declared in council, "that, though in her own con&s;cience &s;he was fully &s;atisfied in matters of religion, yet &s;he did not intend to compel or re&s;train any man's, otherwi&s;e than as they &s;hould be per&s;ua|ded of the truth, upon hearing the word of God ex|plained by learned preachers," <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;uch as &s;hould be licen&s;ed by her authority; which, on the 29th of that month, &s;he committed to Gardiner, Bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, &s;ilencing all that he did not think proper to licence. On Sunday, Augu&s;t 13, the day after this declaration, Bourne, one of Bonner's chaplains, preach|ing at St. Paul's cro&s;s, declaimed again&s;t the late King's proceedings in matters of religion; which &s;o incen&s;ed the people, that a tumult aro&s;e, &s;tones were thrown at him, and a dagger, which, mi&s;&s;ing him narrowly, &s;tuck in a po&s;t of the pulpit. More mi&s;|chief would have en&s;ued, if the tumult had not been appea&s;ed by Rogers and Bradford, two Prote&s;tant di|vines, who carried off the preacher, but were impri|&s;oned them&s;elves for their popularity. This riot pro|duced an order of council to the Lord Mayor and Al|men for calling a common-council, and obliging all children and apprentices to keep their own pari&s;h|churches on holidays, and not attempt any thing to the breach of the common peace: and on the Sunday following, be&s;ides &s;everal lords of the council, the magi&s;trates, and companies of the city, who attended at divine &s;ervice, Sir H. Jernegan was &s;ent with 200 of the guards to &s;ecure Dr Wat&s;on the preacher.</P>
<P>It was now extremely palpable how much the Queen had the Romi&s;h religion at heart;<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen i&s;&s;ues a proclamation concerning reli|gion.</NOTE> and that, as the people in general were &s;o aver&s;e to it, &s;he could not e&s;tabli&s;h it without &s;ome di&s;turbance: and the ferment ran &s;o high in London, as to occa&s;ion its be|ing given out publickly, that 20,000 men would lo&s;e
<PB N="182" REF="193">their lives, before they would &s;uffer an alteration. To allay it in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a proclamation was i&s;|&s;ued on Augu&s;t 18; in which, after taking notice of the inconveniences and dangers which the realm had &s;uffered formerly through diver&s;ity of opinions in que|&s;tions of religion, and of the &s;ame contentions being revived by fal&s;e reports, her Maje&s;ty declared, that &s;he would not hide, but ob&s;erve and maintain for her&s;elf, during her reign, that religion which &s;he had always profe&s;&s;ed, and de&s;ired all her &s;ubjects quietly to enter|tain; &s;ignifying, however, that &s;he would not com|pel any of them thereunto, <HI>till farther order &s;hould be taken therein by common con&s;ent.</HI> In the mean while, &s;he forbade all her &s;ubjects, of all degrees, to move &s;edi|tions, or &s;tir unquietne&s;s in her people, by interpreting the laws of the land after their own fanta&s;ies, but to continue quiet, till &s;uch further order was taken; charging them to live together in Chri&s;tian charity, and to leave off the&s;e new-founded devili&s;h terms of <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> and <HI>heretic,</HI> and threatening to puni&s;h all that &s;hould ra&s;hly pre&s;ume to make any a&s;&s;emblies of peo|ple, or &s;hould therein attempt to &s;tir them to di&s;quiet and di&s;order. Imputing afterwards the &s;preading of fal&s;e rumours and &s;edition, as well to the &s;ubtlety and malice of &s;ome evil-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, taking upon them, without &s;ufficient authority, to reproach and in|terpret the word of God after their own brains, in churches and other places, both in public and private, as to the playing of interludes, and printing of fal&s;e books, ballads, rhymes, and other lewd treati&s;es, in the Engli&s;h tongue, containing doctrine in the pre&s;ent controver&s;ies about the my&s;teries of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion; &s;he forbade all per&s;ons to preach, or, by way of reading in churches, or other public or private places, except in &s;chools of the univer&s;ities, to interpret or teach any &s;criptures or doctrines touching religion, or to act any interludes, or to print any &s;uch book, bal|lad, rhyme, or treati&s;e, without her &s;pecial licence."</P>

<P>It is plain, that whatever moderation is couched in this artful proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">She encourages Popery.</NOTE> it was only in|tended to lull the people a&s;leep till the Queen was crowned, and could carry her point in parliament. Sir James Hales, the only one of the judges that refu&s;ed to &s;ign King Edward's &s;ettle|ment for her exclu&s;ion, telling the ju&s;tices of the peace, at a quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions in Kent, that the laws of the late King were &s;till in force, and that they ought to &s;ee them duly executed, and not &s;uffer them to be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, was taken up on this account, and committed to the King's Bench pri&s;on. He was a con&s;cientious man, and very zealous for the Reformation; but, being ter|rified by threats during his confinement, was per&s;ua|ded by Day to a compliance, which he &s;oon repented; and being di&s;turbed in mind, attempted his own life, next day, by cutting his throat with a penknife. Upon this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he was &s;et at liberty, and retired to his hou&s;e in Kent; but without any enjoyment of life, or perfect recovery of his &s;en&s;es: and finding an opportunity too convenient, one day, of getting abroad undi&s;covered, drowned him&s;elf. Every body, that ad|hered to the laws, had a mark of di&s;plea&s;ure &s;et upon them; and nothing was &s;o agreeable to Mary, as the breach of them by &s;etting up the ma&s;s, the Latin &s;er|vice, and proce&s;&s;ions, the pageants of &s;aints, and the Roman u&s;ates, the practice being recommended by the courtly name of &s;etting forward <HI>the Queen's pro|ceedings,</HI> and orders given in the articles of archidiaco|nical vi&s;itations, for the pre&s;enting of &s;uch as gave them any ob&s;truction. The <HI>Suffolk Prote&s;tants,</HI> alarmed at the&s;e proceedings, addre&s;&s;ed her on the &s;ubject: but were told, "That members mu&s;t obey their head, and not expect to rule it:" and Mr. Dobbs, pre&s;uming to put her in mind of the promi&s;es &s;he had made them with regard to religion, was &s;et in the pillory for three days together. They had &s;erved her in her greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and being the fir&s;t that joined her, laid the founda|tion
<PB N="184" REF="195">of that power, which, afterwards, per&s;ecuted them like others with fire and faggot; an ingratitude, as much owing to the pride of her heart, as to her bigotry in religion The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Montague had &s;ent his &s;on, with twenty men, to her &s;tandard in Suffolk; but this did not excu&s;e him from being turned out of his office, from &s;ix weeks impri&s;onment, and from being fined, with Judge Bromley, 7000 pounds &s;terling for their offences in obeying the late King's commands in drawing his &s;ettlement. She re&s;olved to lay the like fines upon all that had been in arms again&s;t her: a way indeed of rai&s;ing a good deal of money, but likely al&s;o to create her abundance of enemies.</P>
<P>As the &s;ucce&s;s of all her mea&s;ures depended entirely upon the compliance of the approaching par|liament,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in parlia|ment.</NOTE> all manner of illegal and arbitrary practices had been u&s;ed to get an hou&s;e of Commons returned to her purpo&s;e. Beele, who was clerk of the council under Queen Elizabeth, &s;ays, "that, in many places of the country, men were cho&s;en by force and menaces; that, in others, the agents for the court made u&s;e of violence to hinder the commons from coming to an election; that fal&s;e re|turns were made in many places, and &s;ome members, after being elected and returned, were violently thru&s;t out of the hou&s;e of Commons:" which was the ca&s;e of all that were &s;u&s;pected of favouring the reforma|tion. A great many people had &s;ome way or other, during Jane's &s;hort u&s;urpation, rendered them&s;elves obnoxious to the government, which could ea&s;ily &s;ind pretences to hara&s;s them: but, notwith&s;tanding this di&s;advantage, and the violences here mentioned, the Queen was not a little apprehen&s;ive of mi&s;carrying in the point &s;he aimed at, unle&s;s &s;he could prevail with her &s;i&s;ter to conform to her religion. An oppo&s;ition to her mea&s;ures, by the next heir to the crown, could not but give &s;pirit to an oppo&s;ition in parliament, and
<PB N="185" REF="196">deter per&s;ons from con&s;enting to alterations in reli|gion, which, in a &s;hort time, they might be obliged to repeal. The Queen, from the time of their fir&s;t meeting, had laboured to bring the Prince&s;s over to her own way of thinking in matters of religion: and had renewed her per&s;ua&s;ions during all the month of Augu&s;t; but without &s;ucce&s;s. In the beginning of September, &s;he &s;et all the Lords of the council, one after another, for two days together, to talk with her &s;i&s;ter on the &s;ubject: but this teazing of her proved fruitle&s;s, and provoked the Prince&s;s at la&s;t to give them rough an&s;wers, as &s;he knew, that, by acknow|ledging the authority of the Roman Pontiff, &s;he would of cour&s;e own her mother's marriage in&s;uffi|cient. Mary, who would allow firmne&s;s and re&s;olu|tion in no body but her&s;elf, had thoughts of &s;ending her to the Tower, removing her &s;ervants, and putting others about her; imagining that &s;he was confirmed in her non-compliance by &s;ome great men, that in|tended an oppo&s;ition in parliament: but this was too dangerous a &s;tep to be taken till the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was over. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, to ex|tort from her at any rate a compliance, before the parliament met: and &s;uch means were u&s;ed, that, at the latter end of the month, the Prince&s;s con&s;ented to go to ma&s;s with her &s;i&s;ter; doing &s;o perhaps with as little regard to it, as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed afterwards to &s;ome Dutch deputies, who complaining to her of their be|ing forced by the King of Spain to go to ma&s;s, &s;he a&s;ked them, "why they could not go thither as to a farce, tho' they could not a&s;&s;i&s;t at it as a matter of re|ligion?"</P>
<P>However, Elizabeth's going to ma&s;s di&s;heartening all that meditated an oppo&s;ition, the Queen carried mo&s;t of her points, in the parliament, which met on Thur&s;day, October 5, with little difficulty. The chief of the&s;e was, the limiting of all trea&s;ons to the &s;tatute of 25 Edward III. but, to prevent its being
<PB N="186" REF="197">of &s;ervice to any &s;he had a mind to pro&s;ecute, either for religion, or any other pretences, it was clogged with an exception of all per&s;ons, that were either im|pri&s;oned, confined in their own or other hou&s;es, out|lawed, or attainted for trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, before September 30 la&s;t pa&s;t, or excepted out of the pardon granted at her coronation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;olemnity was performed by Stephen Gardiner Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, on Sunday, October 1, and from the benefit of the am|ne&s;ty then publi&s;hed were excepted the &s;tate-pri&s;oners in the Tower or Fleet, 60 per&s;ons mentioned by name, and divers others.</NOTE>. Felonies were like|wi&s;e reduced to &s;uch offences, as had been deemed &s;o before the acce&s;&s;ion of Henry VIII. and thus a provi&s;ion was made for Cardinal Pole's<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an account of him in vol. ii. page 475, and page 6 of this.</NOTE> exerci&s;e of the office of legate (in which quality he was &s;oon ex|pected in England) without involving him&s;elf or the the clergy, as Wol&s;ey had done, in the penalties of a premunire. The &s;piritual e&s;tate in this parliament was compo&s;ed of the &s;ix prelates, lately re&s;tored; the re|formed prelates being mo&s;t of them in pri&s;on; and John Harley Bi&s;hop of Hereford, with John Taylor of Lincoln, who going out, when ma&s;s was &s;aid con|trary to law, were therefore excluded from their &s;eats. Alexander Nowel (afterwards Dean of St. Paul's) re|turned burge&s;s for Loo in Cornwall, was turned out of the Hou&s;e of Commons, becau&s;e, being a preben|dary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, he had, as &s;uch, a &s;eat in the convocation. Whether he was the chapter's repre&s;en|tative in this body (which, after We&s;ton's intru&s;ion into the deanery, doth not &s;eem probable) or whether it was owing to his affection for the reformation, a difference was made between him and Dr. Tregonwell, who was a main in&s;trument in the removal of the Pro|te&s;tant Bi&s;hops, and, though likewi&s;e a prebendary of the &s;ame church, continued to &s;it, as Sir Thomas Haxey<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See note, page 81 of this volume.</NOTE>, and other clergymen, had formerly done, in the Hou&s;e
<PB N="187" REF="198">of Commons. The &s;ub&s;idy of tonnage and poundage for her Maje&s;ty's li&s;e was brought in: and two acts pa&s;&s;ed for the re&s;titution in blood of Edward Earl of Devon, &s;on of Henry Courrenay Marquis of Exeter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 6 of this volume.</NOTE>, and of his mother Gertrude. Three of the above|mentioned bills being con&s;idered as acts of grace, the Queen would not intermix other matters with them in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion; for which rea&s;on the tonnage bill was deferred, and the parliament prorogued, to Tue&s;|day, October 24, when the &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion began.&mdash;The marriage of Henry VIII. with Catherine, the Queen's mother, was declared to be lawful, by the fir&s;t act which pa&s;&s;ed in it, notwith&s;tanding any &s;entence or acts of parliament to the contrary: but without any mention of the papal di&s;pen&s;ation, the chief pretence for its validity. The Prince&s;s Elizabeth, being obliquely declared illegitimate by this law, was treated with great indifference. Other bills pa&s;&s;ed, for the attainders of the Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, the Marquis of Northamp|ton (who was &s;oon after pardoned, and re&s;tored to his blood and honours) the late Duke of Northumber|land, three of his &s;ons, and as many of his accomplices as had &s;uffered with him; and for validating all deeds and writings made during Jane's u&s;urpation, except|ing her grants of crown-lands and commi&s;&s;ions. Two bills, brought in with a view of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the profe&s;|&s;ors of the late reformation, by &s;ubjecting &s;uch as did not &s;ay their &s;ervice, nor come to church, to certain penalties to be inflicted by eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges, and for other puni&s;hment on &s;uch as did not attend the Roman offices of devotion, nor receive the &s;acra|ment, did not pa&s;s; though both hou&s;es agreed to another, for puni&s;hing all per&s;ons, that &s;hould di&s;|turb preachers, or prie&s;ts mini&s;tering in other offices of religion, profane the euchari&s;t, or pull down cro&s;&s;es,

<P>There were &s;ome other acts which Mary had much at heart, in favour of Cardinal Pole, and the Papal claims, but it was not yet &s;ea&s;onable to attempt them. Cardinal Dandino, Legate at Bru&s;&s;els, had &s;ent Fr. Commendone over to England, to &s;ee whether &s;he would reconcile the realm to the church of Rome: and this tru&s;ty and able mini&s;ter received from her a&s;|&s;urances of her full re&s;olution to do &s;o, but that &s;he mu&s;t proceed with caution and &s;ecre&s;y, for &s;ear of rai&s;|ing di&s;turbances, which might defeat her de&s;ign. Pope Julius III. upon this advice, appointed Pole his Le|gate in England; who, &s;etting out from Rome, in Augu&s;t, intended to proceed through Germany to Bru&s;&s;els, where he propo&s;ed to make &s;ome &s;tay, till
<PB N="189" REF="200">the manner of his reception in England was determined: but he had not reached Trent, when his journey was &s;topped by fre&s;h orders, and he returned, in the be|ginning of September, to the neighbourhood of Luna. Hearing afterwards of the repeal of King Edward's laws, he &s;et forwards again; but, the people not being yet prepared to bear the &s;ight of a Papal mini&s;ter, and being extremely aver&s;e to a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Pope's power, which they expected would be followed by all the exactions and grievances, &s;o continually complained of by their ance&s;tors, he was &s;topped a &s;econd time at Dillinghen. Gardiner did not like his coming over, fearing he would govern all in England: and the commons, who had not pa&s;&s;ed the act for re|pealing the late King's laws, till after &s;everal long and warm debates for eight days together, and a divi&s;ion of above a third part the hou&s;e again&s;t it, being &s;ounded on the &s;ubject of the Papal &s;upremacy, appeared &s;o aver&s;e to it, that it was not thought advi&s;able to make the attempt.</P>
<P>The Emperor had propo&s;ed his &s;on Philip to Mary for a hu&s;band, and &s;he had agreed to it &s;o readily, that the articles were drawing up in the beginning of Sep|tember. Her confe&s;&s;or was gained to promote it, and Gardiner by the promi&s;e of a Cardinal's hat; Paget by money; and the Earl of Arundel by his own am|bitious projects. He imagined, that, if &s;he married a foreigner, he might, by that foreigner's favour, get his &s;on (who died &s;ome time after at Bru&s;&s;els) to marry the Prince&s;s Elizabeth: which would be a means of putting the admini&s;tration of public affairs into his hands, and bringing at la&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown into his family; it being generally thought that the Queen's infirmities incapacitated her for bearing chil|dren. The&s;e were her chief favourites; and Norfolk agreed with them, having ever been in the Imperial intere&s;t. Mo&s;t of the council were of opinion, that &s;he could not e&s;pou&s;e a foreigner without e&s;pou&s;ing his

Sir Thomas Cheyne went &s;o far, as to propo&s;e the Earl of Devon|&s;hire: but Mary, who&s;e heart, temper, and manners, were entirely Spani&s;h, excepted again&s;t the Earl as too young and unexperienced in bu&s;ine&s;s; and declared, &s;he would never marry a &s;ubject or &s;ervant, as &s;he could get no honour nor re&s;pect by &s;uch a marriage. This an&s;wer might &s;top the mouths of her coun&s;ellors, but it did not quiet the minds of her &s;ubjects. Pam|phlets were publi&s;hed, repre&s;enting Philip as proud, arrogant, intractable, and incompatible with any one, even with his own father, unequal to her in age, &s;ure to treat her with contempt, and not to &s;tay with her to get children; and as one who, having nothing more in his view than to get England for his &s;on Don Carlos, would domineer over it in the &s;ame imperious manner the Spaniards did in all places, and as he him&s;elf prac|ti&s;ed in Naples, Milan, and his other territories, where an infinite number of ancient families were ruined, and their e&s;tates &s;eized, by his Spani&s;h favourites. Libels were di&s;per&s;ed and dropped in the city, in the court, and even in her chamber; and &s;ome great men, &s;eeing the Queen re&s;olved upon Philip, were for Courtenay's marrying the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, and carrying her down to Devon&s;hire and Cornwall: the Duke of Suf|folk, the Earls of Pembroke and Cumberland, the Lord Clinton, and other noblemen, with all the mili|tary men, were for this party.</P>
<P>An addre&s;s from the hou&s;e of Commons, that the Queen would not marry a foreigner, but one of her own countrymen, gave her a great deal of perplexity. She did not care to receive it; and had at fir&s;t a ju&s;t excu&s;e, being then ill of a di&s;ea&s;e, which afflicted
<PB N="191" REF="204">her annually, attended with a continual palpitation of heart, and affecting her &s;o, that &s;he did nothing but weep whil&s;t it la&s;ted. After her-recovery, &s;he &s;till af|fected delays; and above a month pa&s;&s;ed, after the addre&s;s was drawn up, before it could be pre&s;ented. Her an&s;wer was, that "&s;he held her crown of God, and hoped to find council from him alone on &s;o impor|tant an occa&s;ion; that &s;he had not yet taken any re&s;o|lution on the &s;ubject, but, whenever &s;he did, &s;he would take care to con&s;ult in her marriage the good of the realm, and the benefit of her Commons, though &s;he her&s;elf was principally concerned." The Queen had got the hou&s;e &s;ounded in relation to another mea&s;ure, dictated by her pa&s;&s;ions and hatred to her &s;i&s;ter Eliza|beth: but met with a repul&s;e, which the inju&s;tice of the propo&s;al well de&s;erved. When the Prince&s;s Eli|zabeth had complied with her in going to ma&s;s, &s;he affected to &s;hew her &s;ome favours, knowing how &s;er|viceable &s;he might be in getting the parliament's con|&s;ent to her mea&s;ures: but this was all grimace. She had before u&s;ed to hold Elizabeth by the hand in all great a&s;&s;emblies at court, and &s;hewed her other marks of friend&s;hip and honour: but after the repeal of the late King's lawas in favour of the reformation, took all methods of treating her with &s;uch neglect, and marks of malevolence, that no body about the court dur&s;t vi&s;it the Prince&s;s in her chamber, or &s;peak to her, without the Queen's knowledge. Mary, in getting her own mother's divorce annulled, and removing the &s;lur of illegitimation from her&s;elf, had taken care to leave it &s;till upon her &s;i&s;ter; but this not being deemed &s;u&s;ti|cient, &s;he u&s;ed all her intere&s;t with the parliament, to get the Prince&s;s expre&s;sly declared a ba&s;tard, and ex|cluded from the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The members ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to come into the&s;e mea&s;ures; and the Queen, not finding the parliament fit for all her purpo&s;es, di&s;&s;olved it on December 6; re&s;olving to a&s;|&s;ume

It is otherwi&s;e inconceivable, that, when three fourths of the parochial clergy throughout England were, within a few months, turned out of their benefices, for their inclination to the reformed religion, there &s;hould not be &s;o much as one of the &s;ame &s;entiments returned to repre&s;ent them in this convocation. The reformed deans and dignitaries had been deprived, to make room for others popi&s;hly affected: and this practice had been &s;o general, that there were not above two Deans and four Archdeacons in the lower hou&s;e to defend the late reformation. Dr. Hugh We&s;ton, newly &s;ub&s;tituted Dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter in the room of Dr. Cox, was cho&s;en prolocutor: and, on October 18, &s;ignified to the hou&s;e the Queen's plea&s;ure, that they &s;hould de|bate touching matters of religion, and proceed to the making &s;uch con&s;titutions as they &s;hould think nece&s;|&s;ary. The main point in debate related to the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the holy &s;acrament: and James Haddon and Walter Philips, deans of Exeter and Roche&s;ter, John Philpot, John Elmer, and Richard Cheney, arch|deacons of Winche&s;ter, Stow, and Hereford, with an|other, were all the di&s;putants on the Prote&s;tant &s;ide of the que&s;tion. They held, "that though Chri&s;t was indeed pre&s;ent in the &s;acrament, rightly mini&s;tered ac|cording to his in&s;titution, yet he was not pre&s;ent in that gro&s;s and carnal manner which tho&s;e of the Po|pi&s;h party maintained." They were often checked by
<PB N="193" REF="208">the prolocutor; and though &s;ome great Lords attend|ed; there was a great deal of di&s;order in the di&s;puta|tion, which hindered it from producing any good ef|fect. Both &s;ides pretended to the victory in this di&s;|pute, which la&s;ted &s;ix days; till We&s;ton notified to them the Queen's plea&s;ure for putting an end to the debate; and &s;aid to the reformed divines, <HI>You have the word, and we have the &s;word;</HI> expre&s;&s;ions that &s;hewed plainly which &s;ide had the better of the argument.</P>

Orders were given for the ma&s;s to be &s;aid, and all the Latin offices to be u&s;ed, on Decem|ber 20, in all churches of the kingdom, as at the death of Henry VIII. This was begun that day, and con|tinued all the Queen's reign, without interruption. The &s;everities, which, from the time of her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, had been exerci&s;ed upon the reformed, had prepared them all to expect a cruel per&s;ecution; and tho&s;e, who had mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, &s;ought for opportunities of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas, to take refuge in foreign countries. John a La&s;co, with his German congregation, and other foreigners, had been ordered in September to quit the realm, and about 170 of them went away then in two &s;hips for Copenhagen, leaving only two of their mini&s;ters to &s;erve their coun|trymen, that were merchants &s;ettled in London. Pe|ter Martyr, though he had come over on the public faith, being invited by King Edward, and &s;ent by the city of Stra&s;burgh, and had, on that account, obtained the Queen's licence to return, was &s;o eagerly &s;ought after by his enemies, that it was not without great dif|ficulty be made his e&s;cape into Germany.

The repealing the &s;tatutes that authori&s;ed their mar|riages, left them open to the la&s;h of the canon law; which, though not obligatory in this country, any farther than warranted by cu&s;tom, or con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of the land, was, upon the repeal of tho&s;e &s;tatutes, very clear in di&s;abling the regular clergy, who had made vows of celibacy. How far the private marriages of the &s;ecular clergy before the reformation, in con&s;equence of a general connivance, derogated from the cu&s;tom which gave force to the parts of the canon law received in England, is a que&s;tion fit only for law|yers to decide: but it &s;eems contrary to natural equity, that a bare repeal of former laws &s;hould, without ex|pre&s;s words warranting a retro&s;pect, he made u&s;e of to invalidate, from the beginning, tho&s;e marriages which the laws had authori&s;ed, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as had lawfully contracted them, not for their future, but their pa&s;t, conduct. The Queen's in&s;tructions, on March 4, to the Bi&s;hops, ordered them to deprive all the married clergy of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices and promotions, and not &s;uffer them to bide with their wives, but to divorce and puni&s;h them; though &s;uch prie&s;ts were to be more favourably treated, that with their wives con&s;ent promi&s;ed to ab&s;tain.

<PB N="195" REF="210">in the &s;ame place they were in before, and in allowing them &s;ome &s;mall part of the benefice of which they were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for all to be deprived, and to do penance; the form of confe&s;&s;ion on that occa&s;ion being generally drawn in terms that a man could hardly affirm with veracity. The &s;avour here mentioned was not intended for the regulars, who were dealt with more &s;everely than the &s;eculars, and yet very few of the&s;e la&s;t received any benefit thence, by rea&s;on of the Bi&s;hops di&s;cretionary power. Bonner, indulging him&s;elf in a promi&s;cuous concubinage, had &s;everal ba&s;tards: and was &s;o fond of anticipating orders, that he bad turned all the married prie&s;ts, in his dioce&s;e, out of their livings, before the end of February. In March, the Queen's commi&s;&s;ioners deprived the Archbi&s;hop of York, the Bi&s;hops of St. David's, Che&s;ter, and Bri&s;tol, who had been regulars, and tho&s;e of Glouce&s;ter and Hereford, being only &s;eculars, for their marriage. Taylor, Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, being unmarried, was, at the &s;ame time, deprived of his &s;ee, for the pretended mi&s;de|meanor of having taken a grant of his bi&s;hopric from Edward VI. with the clau&s;e, <HI>Quamdiu bene &s;e ge&s;&s;erit,</HI> i. e. whil&s;t he behaved him&s;elf &s;o as not to merit a de|privation by &s;ome act, which the laws or canons puni&s;h|ed with that penalty. Scory and Barlow, Bi&s;hops of Chiche&s;ter and Bath, prevented the like &s;entences by a re&s;ignation, which contributed to their e&s;cape abroad. Thou&s;ands of the inferior clergy were, in a very &s;hort time, deprived of their livings or their mini&s;trations, on account either of their marriage, or not conforming to the ma&s;s; many of them, upon common &s;ame, with|out proce&s;s, uncited, unheard, and with &s;hocking cir|cum&s;tances of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e changes naturally rai&s;ed great di&s;contents among the reformed in all parts of the kingdom, par|ticularly in London, where they were much more nu|merous than their adver&s;aries: but the effects were not &s;o violent, as tho&s;e excited by the Spani&s;h match,
<PB N="196" REF="211">which occa&s;ioned a general clamour. Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants equally dete&s;ted it, dreading the inqui&s;ition, confi&s;cation of e&s;tates, inva&s;ion of privileges, de&s;truc|tion of liberties, and a &s;hoal of other calamities, the u&s;ual attendants of Spani&s;h tyranny: but the Queen was re&s;olved upon the match, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to divert her from it by any remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>The treaty for it had lain dormant whil&s;t the parlia|ment was &s;itting: but, &s;oon after the di&s;&s;olution, the Counts of Egmond and Lalain, John de Montmorency Lord of Courieres, and two other amba&s;&s;adors, were &s;ent over by the Emperor to conclude it in form, and adju&s;t the articles: which was done accordingly, and they were &s;igned, on Friday, January 12, by the Im|perial amba&s;&s;adors, and by the Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Arundel, the Lord Paget, Sir Robert Roche&s;|ter, and Sir W. Petre, the Queen's commi&s;&s;ioners: and, on the Sunday and Monday following, were communicated by Gardiner to the nobility at court, and to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, with a pompous account of the advantages thereof to the nation, and an high encomium of Philip. But this declaration of Gardiner's did not cure the jealou|&s;ies of the people; and their di&s;contents were &s;o plain, that the Emperor was in &s;ome pain for his &s;on's &s;afety, when he &s;hould arrive in England.</P>
<P>The people, more clamourous in proclaiming their grievances,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Sir T. Wyat's in&s;urrection.</NOTE> than either cool in con&s;ider|ing, or wi&s;e in taking proper methods for their relief, vented their fury in loud and u&s;ele&s;s exclamations again&s;t the Spaniards; and, tho' they did not want numbers for any enterpri&s;e, they had no leader capable of forming a great de&s;ign, and qua|lified to unite them in its execution. Every one took the &s;tep he imagined mo&s;t conducive to his end, but without a proper concert: and, as the mo&s;t obvious thing which offered it&s;elf to their thoughts, was the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uccours from France, to oppo&s;e the
<PB N="197" REF="212">mighty power of the Emperor, &s;ome applied to the French Amba&s;&s;ador in England for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. M. de Noailles gave them a cool an&s;wer, being afraid of in|volving his ma&s;ter in a war with England: and when the Mayor and Aldermen of Plymouth offered, by their agent &s;ent on purpo&s;e to the court of France, to put them&s;elves under the Gallic Monarch's protection, and to receive a garri&s;on of his troops, being re&s;olved not to admit Philip, nor obey any of his commands, their propo&s;al was not accepted for the &s;ame rea&s;on: The Engli&s;h, however, re&s;olved upon an in&s;urrection: and Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, who had been lately pardoned, &s;eemed, on account of his &s;uperior quality, per&s;onal bravery, and experience in war, a fit per&s;on to head the undertaking. But he had no enterprizing genius, and wanted that &s;udden courage of mind, and vigour in action, which are the life and &s;oul of &s;uch affairs: and, though his brother the Lord Thomas Grey, a man of more active re&s;olution, got him to undertake for rai&s;ing the midland counties, yet his Grace had otherwi&s;e a &s;mall &s;hare in advancing the de&s;ign. Sir Thomas Wyat, a Kenti&s;h gentleman, much e&s;teemed and beloved, was the mo&s;t active per|&s;on in the affair: he had been frequently employed in emba&s;&s;ies, particularly in Spain; and, having there ob&s;erved the &s;ubtlety and cruelty of the Spaniards, he had contracted an utter aver&s;ion to their manner of go|vernment. Sir Peter Carew, and other gentlemen, embarked with him in the de&s;ign: but they re&s;olved not to attempt any thing till Philip's landing, when, they expected, the nation would be mo&s;t affected with a &s;en&s;e of their immediate danger.</P>
<P>This undertaking might, in all probability, have &s;ucceeded, had a general ri&s;ing been made, as propo|&s;ed, in all parts of the country at one time: but either the government had &s;ome information of the de&s;ign, as it &s;eems not improbable from &s;ome mea&s;ures they took four days before the ri&s;ing, or el&s;e, as is gene|rally
<PB N="198" REF="213">&s;aid, the concert was broke by Sir Peter Carew. This gentleman, too indi&s;creet in communicating the affair, or too eager to appear in arms, perhaps out of fear that delays might produce a di&s;covery, and pre|vent the execution of the de&s;ign, began, before the time appointed, to rai&s;e men in Cornwall: but, not having got a competent force together, when a &s;upe|rior one marched again&s;t him, he was obliged to fly to France for re&s;uge. This alarmed the other con&s;pi|rators, and di&s;concerred all their mea&s;ures. The Duke of Su&s;folk, to avoid an ar$e&s;t, left the town, on Janu|ary 25, with the Lords Thomas and Leonard his bro|thers; and going down to his e&s;tates in the &s;hires of Warwick and Liece&s;ter, endeavoured to rai&s;e the coun|try: but was followed &s;o clo&s;e by Francis Ha&s;tings Earl of Huntingdon, with a body of three hundred hor&s;e, that, not having a force &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e him, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;mall party; and, tru&s;ting to one Un|derwood, his park keeper at A&s;tley, for concealment, was betrayed by him, and delivered up to Hunting|don. Sir Thomas Cheney, Warden of the Cinque ports, had been &s;ent to take care of Kent: but was not able to prevent Sir T. Wyat's ri&s;ing, on January 25, at Maid&s;tone, where he publi&s;hed a declaration, again&s;t the Queen's evil coun&s;ellors, and the Spani&s;h match, which he plainly &s;aw would ruin the nation. The country flocking in to him, he advanced with 12 or 1500 men to Roche&s;ter, and took up his head-quar|ters in the ca&s;tle. Mary was a little puzzled how to act on this occa&s;ion; &s;he was jealous, that the rebels de&s;igned to marry her &s;i&s;ter to the Earl of Devon, and put them upon the throne: and yet, they were both &s;uch favourites of the nation, that it was dangerous to take them up at &s;o tickli&s;h a juncture, e&s;pecially as it did not appear that they had the lea&s;t concern in the in&s;urrection. She knew not well whom to &s;u&s;pect; and it was only out of abundant caution, that the Mar|quis of Northampton (lately pardoned) the Lord Darcy,
<PB N="199" REF="214">Sir Edward Warner, and others, found afterwards to be innocent, were committed to the Tower. How|ever, &s;he &s;ent the Duke of Norfolk, and Sir H. Jer|negan, with a great part of her guards, and a body of other forces, again&s;t the rebels: and to increa&s;e their numbers, the city of London rai&s;ed 500 men, and &s;ent them under one Alexander Brett, to reinforce the Queen's troops. Norfolk advancing, on Monday, January 29, to Roche&s;ter bridge, found it guarded by the rebels, and the river lined by 60 or 80 pieces of cannon; yet he re&s;olved to force his pa&s;&s;age, if they did not &s;ubmit upon the offer of a pardon. It was not accepted by any one, except, in appearance, by Sir George Harper; who, going over to the Duke, per|&s;uaded the 500 Londoners to de&s;ert, and they, ad|vancing to the bridge, turned &s;uddenly about, and declared for Wyat: which put Norfolk and Jernegan in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that they immediately &s;led; and Wyat, coming up with a party of hor&s;e, intercepted the re&s;t, and &s;eized eight bra&s;s cannon, with the Duke's baggage. Had this bold chieftain marched directly to London, as was propo&s;ed, without lo&s;ing time, he would have found an ea&s;y admittance into the city, and the Queen would have been in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But his delays allowing her time to recollect her&s;elf, and provide better for her &s;ecurity, to encourage her friends, and intimidate the di&s;affected, &s;he cau&s;ed, on February 1, proclamation to be made over the city, that the Duke of Suffolk and Sir Peter Carew, with their accomplices, were di&s;per&s;ed and fled; offering, at the &s;ame time, a general pardon to all the Kenti&s;h-men, except Wyat, Harper, Sir Henry I&s;ley, and Rud&s;tone, and a reward of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year in land, for ever, to any per&s;on who &s;hould take the fir&s;t of tho&s;e rebels. Count Egmond fell down the river to fetch over 4 or 5000 Spaniards from Flanders: and the Queen went in the afternoon, with her ladies and train, making a mourn|ful figure, to Guildhall, where the common council
<PB N="200" REF="215">was a&s;&s;embled. She there made a vehement &s;peech again&s;t Wyat, "repre&s;enting the in&s;olence of his de|mands, that &s;he &s;hould put her own per&s;on and four of her council into his hands; and (to render him odious) charging him with a de&s;ign to &s;ack the city." To engage the Londoners the more firmly to her in|tere&s;t, &s;he declared her re&s;olution of taking up her re|&s;idence within their walls; but in the mean time armed a body of 500 men, chiefly foreigners, for the defence of the bridge. Her &s;peech had &s;uch an effect, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her agents, that the city re|&s;olved to defend itielf, and 20,000 men took arms, the next day, in her behalf. W. Lord Howard of Effingham was appointed to command them, as her lieutenant in London; and it was propo&s;ed, that the Earl of Pembroke &s;hould march with 6 or 7000 of them again&s;t Wyat; but the Londoners ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed to cro&s;s the river. The weather was very bad, provi&s;ions exceeding &s;carce, and, Wyat having no money to &s;upply the wants of his men, they de&s;erted in great numbers, during his &s;tay at Deptford: but marching thence, on February 3, he entered South|wark without oppo&s;ition, and found there &s;ome relief: but the draw-bridge was taken away, and the gate &s;o well guarded, that there was no forcing a pa&s;&s;age that way into London. Provi&s;ions began to be &s;carce on the other &s;ide of the river: and the Queen could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing her a&s;toni&s;hment, that &s;he and her council &s;hould be be&s;ieged by &s;uch a handful of men (for the rebels were not above 2000, when they en|tered Southwark) in &s;o populous a town, in the mid&s;t of ber realm, with all her nobility about her, and no body daring to undertake the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them; which gave rea&s;on to think that few di&s;approved Wyat's proceed|ings. Affairs &s;eemed in &s;o bad a &s;tate, that all the council declared, they never liked the match: and the Queen conde&s;cended to &s;end Wyat a me&s;&s;age, pre&s;&s;ing him to lay down his arms, and promi&s;ing that &s;he
<PB N="201" REF="216">would not marry the Prince of Spain; that &s;he would pardon him with all his companions, and never bear him the lea&s;t ill will:" but he demanded the Tower, with four of her council, and in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing her actually married to an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled matters with his friends in the city, Wyat marched with 1500 men, on February 6, from Southwark to King&s;ton; where he found the bridge broke down, and 2 or 300 men po&s;ted on the other &s;ide the river. Two pieces of cannon made them re|tire; and having repaired the bridge, he pa&s;&s;ed all his forces over in two hours, and advanced, about eleven at night, without re&s;ting, directly towards London. He might have reached London in the dead of the night; and he marched, undi&s;covered by any of the Queen's &s;couts, to Brentford: but, when he had pa&s;&s;ed this place, the wheels of one of his car|riages broke, and he would &s;tay to have the cannon re|mounted. Several experienced officers were again&s;t a delay, which would break their appointments with the citizens: but he was deaf to all their remon&s;tran|ces, which gave every body &s;o ill an opinion of the enterpri&s;e, that abundance of his men quitted him; and Harper, to procure his pardon, made ha&s;te to court, and gave the Queen an account of Wyat's pro|ceeding and de&s;igns. Effingham was immediately or|dered to his charge in the city; and Pembroke drew out his forces, amounting to 7 or 8000 men, which had been rai&s;ed during Wyat's &s;tay at Deptford and Southwark. Wyat, after making a halt at Knight&s;bridge to refre&s;h his men, advanced about noon through Pica|dilly to St. James's, pa&s;&s;ing by the Earl of Pembroke's Gens d' armes, which were po&s;ted on an hill again&s;t it, without any attack, except of his rear, which he would not march back to &s;upport. Followed by that Earl, and continuing his march to Charing-cro&s;s, he char|ged Sir John Gage the Lord Chamberlain, who was po&s;ted there with a body of hor&s;e, and a thou&s;and
<PB N="202" REF="217">foot, &s;o bri&s;tly, that he put them to flight, and &s;eized their train of arrillery: a di&s;a&s;ter which threw the court at Whitehall into the utmo&s;t terror and confu|&s;ion. Wyat &s;till advanced with his party, pa&s;&s;ing through the mid&s;t of armed men, that lined the &s;treets, without any oppo&s;ition, till he came to Ludgate, which he expected would be opened to him: but Lord Ef|fingham being there, with a &s;trong guard, prevented his entrance. This di&s;appointment frighted his men &s;o, that only eighty were le&s;t with him; and with the&s;e retiring to Temple-Bar, he there faced all the Queen's army under the Earl of Pembroke, and &s;tood his ground, till a compo&s;ition was made by her Maje&s;ty's &s;ending a general pardon for all his party. He then yielded to Sir Maurice Berkeley, and after being ex|amined by the council, was carried to the Tower.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The Prince&s;s Eliza|beth and Earl of Devon taken into cu&s;tody.</NOTE> The rebellion was no &s;ooner &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, than the Earl of Devon&s;hire was taken up; put into the cu&s;tody of the Earl of Su&s;&s;ex; and after a few days &s;ent to the Tower. A party likewi&s;e of 500 hor&s;e was &s;ent to A&s;heridge in Buck|ingham&s;hire, to bring up the Prince&s;s Elizabeth: but &s;he had been ill for &s;ome time, and &s;everal days pa&s;&s;ed before &s;he was able to bear travelling. Her di&s;temper was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be a drop&s;y: but, whatever it was, &s;he began to recover in the beginning of March; and de&s;iring to &s;peak with the Queen, was refu&s;ed an audience. This was done on pretence that &s;he ought fir&s;t to clear her&s;elf of the &s;u&s;picions under which &s;he lay: but the true rea&s;on was, the Queen had re&s;olved on her death, all means being u&s;ed to find out matter of accu&s;ation again&s;t her, in order to a charge then actually drawing up in form, &s;he was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower. But the&s;e mea&s;ures failing, &s;he was relea&s;ed on May 19, and pa&s;&s;ing by We&s;t|min&s;ter without &s;eeing the Queen, went to Richmond in Surry: and declining a match propo&s;ed by the Im|perial
<PB N="203" REF="218">mini&s;ters, with Philbert Emanuel Duke of Savoy, was &s;ent thence to Wood&s;tock in Oxford&s;hire, where &s;he was kept under the care of the Lord Williams of Tame and Sir H. Bedingfield. The Earl of Devon|&s;hire was &s;oon afterwards conveyed pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Fothcringhay in Northampton&s;hire. Being &s;et at liberty on April 5, 1555, at the interce&s;&s;ion of King Philip, he went to Bru&s;&s;els; but &s;inding him&s;elf watched there by &s;pice, he got leave to travel into Italy, where he died, at Fadua, on October 4, next year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Lady Jane Grey and her husband, with others, put to death.</NOTE> The &s;hare, which the Duke of Suf|folk had in Wyat's in&s;urrection, proved &s;atal to his daughter the Lady Jane, who acquainted him in a letter, that &s;he was not in&s;en&s;ible that he had &s;hortened her days. Before this rebellion, Mary &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to deal gently with Jane: for after &s;he was found guilty of high trer&s;on, &s;he had the liberty of the <HI>pa|rade</HI> in the Tower, and of walking in the Queen's garden; but now it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to extremities, Mary's &s;a&s;ety being deemed precarious while her rival was alive. Dr. Fecknam Dean of St. Paul's was &s;ent with a me&s;&s;age from the Queen, de|&s;iring that &s;he and her hu&s;band might prepare for im|mediate death, and exhorted her to embrace the Ro|man Catholic religion. She received the me&s;&s;age with great temper and evenne&s;s of mind; but as to the Doctor's advice, &s;he &s;aid &s;he had no time to enter into religious controver&s;ies, and &s;hould &s;pend the little time &s;he had in preparing for eternity. Fecknam, mi&s;taking her meaning, prevailed upon Mary to grant her a re|prieve for three days. When he acquainted the un|happy captive of the re&s;pite, he de&s;ired &s;he would hear him on the &s;ubject of religion. Jane told him, he had mi&s;taken her meaning, and that &s;he was not de&s;irous of longer life. Then he di&s;puted with her upon different points of religion, concerning which &s;he argued with uncommon &s;trength of rea&s;on, di&s;play|ing
<PB N="204" REF="219">a &s;urpri&s;ing fund of knowledge. Her hu&s;band, the Lord Guilford Dudley, de&s;ired to take his la&s;t farewel of her before he &s;uffered; and this reque&s;t was granted: but &s;he would not con&s;ent to &s;uch an interview, le&s;t it &s;hould, by an unrea&s;onable tender|ne&s;s, &s;hake their mutual fortitude, and make them leave the world with greater regret, neither of them being &s;eventeen years of age. However, on February 12, the day of their execution, &s;he viewed him through the window as he went to Tower-hill, and even &s;aw his headle&s;s corp&s;e brought back in a cart to be in|terred in the Tower chapel. As her u&s;urpation had been involuntary on her part, and her ca&s;e generally pitied, it was not judged proper to execute her in pub|lic; therefore the Tower was determined on for the fatal &s;cene. About two hours after her bu&s;band's death &s;he was conducted to the &s;caffold, and in her way thither &s;aluted the &s;pectators with equal affability and compo&s;ure, holding Dr. Fecknam by the hand. The Lieutenant of the Tower begging &s;he would favour him with &s;ome memorial, &s;he pre&s;ented him with tablets, in which &s;he had written three &s;hort &s;entences in the Greek and Latin languages, &s;etting forth her own ca&s;e. When &s;he reached the place of her &s;uffer|ing, &s;he embraced Fecknam mo&s;t affectionately, &s;ay|ing, "God will requite you, good Sir, for your hu|manity to me; though it gave me more unea&s;ine&s;s than all the terrors of approaching death." In her &s;peech on the &s;caffold, &s;he owned her&s;elf guilty, not that &s;he had gra&s;ped at the crown, but becau&s;e &s;he had not refu&s;ed the offer. She de&s;ired that her mi&s;|fortune might be a warning to po&s;terity, that innocent meaning is not a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for di&s;turbing the pub|lic: and ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who yield to other people's ambition, help to accompli&s;h their &s;chemes, and are drawn into unlawful practices, though again&s;t their will, have a great deal to an&s;wer for. Having &s;pent a &s;hort time in devotion, her female attendants took
<PB N="205" REF="220">off her grown, and the ornaments of her head and neck, and covered her eyes with a handkerchief. Then &s;he laid her head on the block, and encouraged the execu|tioner, who at fir&s;t he&s;itated to execute his office; which at length, however, he performed; her fate drawing tears from the eyes of all the &s;pectators, Papi&s;ts as well as Prote&s;tants. Her father, the Duke of Suf|folk, was, five days after, tried before the Earl of Arun|del; and pleaded in his defence, that it was no trea&s;on in a peer of the realm, to rai&s;e his power, and make proclamation, only to keep &s;trangers out of the realm; de&s;iring the opinion of the &s;erjeants at law then pre&s;ent. They declining to give it, he was, on February 23, beheaded, his brother Lord Thomas undergoing the &s;ame fate on April 27.</P>
<P>Mary made a pretence of Wyat's rebellion, to take up every one &s;he &s;u&s;pected, and &s;he &s;u&s;pected all that had either experience or talents for war, or any con&s;iderable intere&s;t in their countries. The Tower of London was &s;oon filled with per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction: above fifty officers, knights, and gentlemen, be&s;ides Wyat, were put to death, as &s;oon as the rebellion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. This might be the effect of Spani&s;h politics; but what &s;he did to the common people, probably, aro&s;e from a cruel and vindictive temper. All Princes u&s;ed to &s;pare, or make few examples of the&s;e, yet &s;he not only &s;ent twenty-two to be executed with Alexander Brett in Kent, but cau&s;ing twenty gibbets to be erected in different quarters of London, hanged fifty of the in&s;urgents on them, &s;o that no body could walk the &s;treets without an offen&s;ive and &s;hocking &s;pectacle.

<P>The parliament met on Thur&s;day, April 5; and the Chancellor, in his &s;peech to the two hou&s;es, after "a&s;&s;erting the Queen's right to the crown by inheri|tance and the regular cour&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and affirming her right to chu&s;e a hu&s;band for her&s;elf, maintained, that &s;he had exerci&s;ed this la&s;t very pro|perly, and laid before them the articles of marriage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e articles implied&mdash;That, by virtue of the marriage, Philip &s;hould enjoy the title of King of England, conjunctly with Mary, as long as the marriage &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but that the Queen &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of the revenues of England, and the nomination to all em|ployments and benefices &s;hould be conferred upon the natives of England only: that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the titles belonging to the King her hu&s;band: that her jointure &s;hould be &s;ixty thou&s;and livres: that the children of the marriage &s;hould &s;ucceed to the effects of the mo|ther: that the Archduke Charles, the &s;on of Philip, &s;hould enjoy the kingdom of Spain, Naples and Sicily, with the duchy of Milan, and all the Italian dominions; but, in default of Prince Charles and his i&s;&s;ue, tho&s;e &s;overeignties &s;hould devolve to the elde&s;t born of Philip and Mary: that this fir&s;t born &s;hould, at any rate, have Bur|gundy and the Netherlands: that the younger &s;ons and daughters of the marriage &s;hould be provided with appanages, and portions in England: that in ca&s;e the marriage &s;hould produce daughters only, the elde&s;t &s;hould &s;ucceed to Burgundy and the Netherlands, provided &s;he &s;hould, with the con&s;ent of her brother Charles, e&s;pou&s;e a native of the&s;e countries, or one of her mother's dominions; otherwi&s;e Prince Charles &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e countries, and provide her with a portion a&s;&s;igned upon Spain and the Netherlands: that, if Prince Charles &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, the elde&s;t &s;on of Philip and Mary, or in default of &s;ons, the elde&s;t daughter &s;hould &s;ucceed to all the dominions of her father and mother; and that the &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould not intrench upon the laws, cu&s;toms, and privileges, of the countries compo&s;ing his or her inheritance, nor admini&s;ter the government by any other than natives of the re&s;pective countries.&mdash;There was a clau&s;e annexed, importing, that, before the con&s;ummation of the marriage, Philip &s;hould &s;olemnly &s;wear to the ob&s;ervation of the fol|lowing articles: That all his dome&s;tics &s;hould be Engli&s;h, or &s;ubjects of the Queen: that he &s;hould bring no foreigner into England, who might be di&s;agreeable to the natives of this country: that he &s;hould make no change in the laws, &s;tatutes, and cu&s;toms, of England: that he &s;hould not convey the Queen from her dominions, without her own expre&s;s de&s;ire; nor any of the children, without the con&s;ent of the no|bility: that, in ca&s;e of his &s;urviving the Queen without i&s;&s;ue by her he &s;hould not arrogate any right to him&s;elf upon England or its de|pendencies; but leave the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the lawful heir: that he &s;hould not carry jewels or any thing of value out of the kingdom; nor alie|nate any thing belonging to the crown, nor &s;uffer any &s;ort of u&s;ur|pation: and that, notwith&s;tanding this marriage, the alliance be|tween England and France &s;hould remain uninfringed.</NOTE>."
<PB N="207" REF="222">But the main tendency of his &s;peech was, to endea|vour the getting &s;uch a power ve&s;ted in the Queen, as &s;hould enable her to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, according to her own plea&s;ure. This propo&s;al was &s;uppo&s;ed to come from the Emperor; who wanted to have matters &s;o &s;ettled before his &s;on's arrival, that the Queen might di&s;po&s;e of the crown, in &s;uch manner, as he did not doubt to prevail on her to do. However, the two hou&s;es were &s;o alarmed at this &s;cheme for di&s;inheriting the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, and &s;ubjecting the nation to a fo|reign yoke, and to Spani&s;h tyranny, that they not only rejected it, but took &s;ome precautions again&s;t any pre|tence for &s;uch an attempt. Thus they would not allow Philip, even, a matrimonial crown; and, tho' they confirmed the articles of the marriage, they added a provi&s;o, declaring, "that her Maje&s;ty, as their <HI>only Queen, &s;hould &s;olely, and as a &s;ole Queen,</HI> enjoy the crown and &s;overeignty of her realms and &s;ubjects, with all the pre-eminencies, dignities, and rights, thereto be|longing, in &s;uch <HI>&s;ole and only e&s;tate,</HI> and in as large and ample a manner in all degrees and exerci&s;es, from and after the &s;olemnization of the &s;aid marriage, and at all times during the &s;ame, as &s;he u&s;ed to do before, and actually enjoyed at pre&s;ent, without any right, title, claim, or demand, to be given, come, or accrue to the Prince of Spain, either as tenant by courte&s;y of the realms, or by <HI>any other means,</HI> in virtue of the &s;aid marriage, of, in, and to the &s;aid crown, &s;overeignty, realms, dominions, authority, and rights thereunto belonging, notwith&s;tanding the &s;aid marriage, or any &s;tatute, pre&s;cription, cu&s;tom, or <HI>any other thing</HI> to the contrary." Affirming her right to the ordinary au|thority of a King, they avoided inve&s;ting her with the extraordinary powers granted to Henry VIII. and when
<PB N="208" REF="223">a bill was afterwards, on April 17, brought into the hou&s;e of Lords, for declaring <HI>or imagining the death of the Queen's hu&s;band, whil&s;t he was alive, to be trea&s;on,</HI> they were &s;o jealous of its being abu&s;ed to an ill pur|po&s;e, that it was laid a&s;ide after the fir&s;t reading. There was certainly ground enough for this jealou&s;y, when Philip's partizans gave out in all places, that he was <HI>the true and undoubted heir, by right of inheritance,</HI> to this crown, as de&s;cended of John of Gaunt, and &s;hew|ed every where a tree of con&s;anguinity, which they had drawn up &s;o, as to contain only the per&s;ons that &s;erved to deduce his de&s;cent; omitting entirely the elder branches. It cau&s;ed a general indignation to &s;ee the Queen encouraging &s;uch impo&s;tures: and the people exclaimed furiou&s;ly again&s;t her, for making no con|&s;cience, either of taking away the crown from the right heirs, or of giving it to a foreigner.</P>
<P>The parliament rejected &s;ome other bills relating to religion; particularly two for taking away the pen&s;i|ons from married prie&s;ts, one for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing erroneous opinions contained in books, and two others for re|viving the act of the &s;ix articles, and the old &s;tatutes again&s;t the Lollards, here&s;y, and erroneous preaching. Cardinal Pole had arrived, on January 25, at Bru&s;&s;els: and, matters not being yet &s;ufficiently prepared for his reception in England, he employed him&s;elf in medi|ating a peace between France and the Emperor. How|ever, he did not neglect pre&s;&s;ing the Queen, by letters and me&s;&s;ages, to unite the realm to the &s;ee of Rome, and to re&s;tore the Papal &s;upremacy, without deferring it a moment for any worldly con&s;iderations: but &s;he had her marriage &s;o much at heart, that, till it was &s;et|tled, &s;he would not trouble her&s;elf about religion. He was &s;urpri&s;ed to find her in&s;i&s;ting, that the Pope &s;hould confirm the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in the enjoyment of church-lands for ever; and he in vain attempted to di&s;&s;uade her from it; demanding, at the &s;ame time, to be re&s;tored
<PB N="209" REF="224">to his own e&s;tate; which it was not yet &s;ea&s;onable to attempt.</P>
<P>Six new Bi&s;hops had been con&s;ecrated, the day be|fore the meeting of the parliament, to increa&s;e the number of votes in the hou&s;e of Lords: yet there did not appear above ten of this order on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. One of the&s;e was Ton&s;tal, &s;tiled Bi&s;hop of Durham; though that bi&s;hopric was actually di&s;|&s;olved, and continued &s;o till the end of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, when an act pa&s;&s;ed for its re-erection, and re&s;toring him to all its former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, except Cold-Harbour, and &s;ome other hou&s;es in London, which had been granted to the Earl of Shrew&s;bury. The Queen di&s;&s;olved the parliament on May 5, and then i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, fixing the rate of the currency of Spani&s;h and Portu|gue&s;e cru&s;adoes, in which, probably, numbers of the members had been paid.</P>
<P>Nothing now took up Mary's thoughts but the ex|pectations of Philip's arrival, and the making of pre|parations for his reception. She had never &s;een him, but his picture had charmed her: &s;he thought every day an age till he came, and was impatient at his af|fected delays. He arrived, on July 19,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip ar|rives, and is married to the Queen.</NOTE> off the i&s;le of Wight, with a fleet of 160 &s;ail, on board of which were 6000 Spaniards, de&s;igned to &s;erve in England had there been occa&s;ion: but the malecontents, in de&s;pair of &s;uccours, after being bid to expect nothing from France, had laid a&s;ide all thoughts of an in&s;urrection. He brought with him a va&s;t trea&s;ure, two cart-loads of coin, and ninety-&s;even che&s;ts of bullion: and the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Trea&s;urer, the Earls of Arundel and Rutland, with the Lord Paget, waiting upon him the next morning, conducted him a&s;hore to Southampton; from whence, after a &s;tay of three days, he removed to Winche&s;ter. The Queen met him at this la&s;t place, and they were married on Wedne&s;day, July 25, the fea&s;t of St. James, the tutelar Saint of Spain, &s;he be|ing
<PB N="210" REF="225">in her 39th year, and older than him by eleven years and three months; the Marquis of Winche&s;ter, with the Earls of Arundel, Bedford, Derby, and Pem|broke, performing the ceremony of giving her away, in the name of the kingdom; and Gardiner celebrating the marriage-office. On Augu&s;t 18, they made a pompous entry into London: where pageants and triumphal arches had been erected, and other marks of rejoicing were exhibited at a va&s;t expence. Removing in a few days from Whitehall to Richmond, they di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed their train of nobility; and then retiring to Hampton-Court, made it their ordinary re&s;idence. Mary had there her hu&s;band to her&s;elf, &s;carce ever &s;uffering him to be a moment out of her &s;ight. He was &s;tiff, re&s;erved, and formal; no drawing-room was kept, and no admittance to him, but with a deal of ceremony, and after a&s;king an audience; forms unu|&s;ual in England, and which did not a little di&s;gu&s;t the nobility.</P>
<P>A parliament that would come into all the mea&s;ures, was what the mini&s;try now had principally in view. The flight of almo&s;t half the gentry of the nation, and the di&s;piritedne&s;s of the re&s;t, were favourable to their wi&s;hes: and to &s;ecure it &s;till more, the Queen i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, directing what per&s;ons &s;he would have cho&s;en for the hou&s;e of Commons. She thought fit likewi&s;e to in&s;inuate continually, that &s;he was with child, and owned her pregnancy to foreign amba&s;&s;adors: but it proved only the beginning of a drop&s;y, though the phy&s;icians &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen brings forth a mola.</NOTE> it was a mole or lump of fle&s;h, which by its weight had a &s;low motion, that agitated her whole belly, and was at la&s;t taken from her, though not without great difficulty. Few people believed it, or thought it po&s;&s;ible for her to be with child; but it was a con|venient notion for carrying &s;ome matters in parliament, and it &s;erved to keep Philip longer in England than he would have &s;taid. The &s;e&s;&s;ion began on Monday, No|vember
<PB N="211" REF="226">12, the Chancellor in his harangue recommend|ed to them the King's coronation, and the &s;ettlement of religion:<NOTE PLACE="inter">The parliament admits the Pope's Legate, and the laity's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of church lands is confirmed.</NOTE> and a bill being brought in for the repeal of Car|dinal Pole's attainder, it was &s;o readily pa&s;&s;ed by both hou&s;es, that it had the royal a&s;&s;ent on the 22d; the King and Queen going both to the parliament-hou&s;e, and the latter fancying that &s;he felt the child leap in her womb upon this occa&s;ion. She carried on this farce &s;o far, that &s;he received compliments on it from foreign Princes, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung, and orders were given for prayers to be &s;aid at all ma&s;&s;es for the child's pre&s;ervation. Pole, who had waited &s;ome time near Dover, till his attainder was repealed, came on Saturday, November 24, to London; and was vi&s;ited by all the nobility. On Wedne&s;day following, the two hou&s;es were called to Whitehall: and the Cardinal, having returned his thanks for their late favour to him, exhorted them to be reconciled to the church of Rome; into the bo&s;om whereof he was ready to receive them, and grant them an ab&s;olution from all &s;piritual cen&s;ures. This pro|duced a conference, next day, between committees of the Lords and Commons; and, an addre&s;s being drawn up in the name of both hou&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of their reunion, and pre&s;ented to the King and Queen, the Legate, at their interce&s;&s;ion, ab&s;olved the Parlia|ment, the whole realm, and all the dominions of Eng|land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Cardinal u&s;ed the following form of ab&s;olution:&mdash;"Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which, with his mo&s;t precious blood, hath redeem|ed and wa&s;hed us from all our &s;ins and iniquities, that he might purcha&s;e to him&s;elf a glorious &s;pou&s;e, without &s;pot or wrinkle; and whom the Father hath appointed head over all his church, He by his mercy ab&s;olve you. And we, by apo&s;tolic authority given unto us (by the mo&s;t Holy Lord Pope Julius III. his Vicegerent here on earth) do ab&s;olve and deliver y$$, and every of you, with the whole realm, and the dominions thereof, from all here&s;y and &s;chi&s;m, and from all and every judgment, cen&s;ures, and pains, for that cau&s;e in|$urred. And al&s;o we do re&s;tore you again unto the unity of our mo|ther, the holy church, as in our letters more plainly it &s;hall appear, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t." After this ceremony was over, they went in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to the chapel royal, where <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung: and becau&s;e this return to the Ro|man communion &s;ell on St. Andrew's day, the Cardinal procured an order for keeping that fe&s;tival with an additional office. On Sunday following, the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the two hou&s;es to the Papal authority, and the ab&s;olution given by the Cardinal, were repeated by Bi&s;hop Gardiner, the Chancellor, in a &s;ermon, at St. Paul's cro&s;s, from Romans xiii. 11.</NOTE>. In con&s;equence hereof, an act was to be made
<PB N="212" REF="227">for repealing all the &s;tatutes formerly made again&s;t the Papal &s;upremacy: but that affair was attended with &s;uch difficulties, that, after a week's con&s;ideration, and debates, no way could be found out, but to get the Pope to confirm all the church-lands to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. This was done upon an addre&s;s from the convocation, relea&s;ing all their claim, and that of the clergy they repre&s;ented, to any of them, and de&s;iring &s;uch a confirmation: and the Legate, on December 24, &s;igned an in&s;trument for that purpo&s;e; which is recited in the act <HI>for repealing all &s;tatutes again&s;t the Pope, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing eccle&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions conveyed to the laity.</HI> By this act, which did not pa&s;s the hou&s;es till January 4, the Papal &s;upremacy, the juri&s;diction of Bi&s;hops and eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and the prerogative of the crown, were put on the &s;ame footing, as they &s;tood on in the 20th of Henry VIII. all &s;ees, colleges, ho&s;pitals, &s;chools, and other foundations erected, all legal marriages, though within the degrees prohibited by the canon law, contracted, all in&s;titutions to bene|fices granted, and all proce&s;&s;es carried on, and all church-lands conveyed to laymen, according to the late laws in being, &s;ince the &s;eparation from Rome, were confirmed.</P>

<PB N="213" REF="228">lea&s;es, made either by them or by other &s;piritual per&s;ons after re&s;ignation, were laid a&s;ide. A book&s;eller of London, who had printed a great number of libels again&s;t the marriage, and the Romi&s;h religion, had been di&s;covered and taken &s;ometime in October: and it was probably owing to his confe&s;&s;ion, that, before the 26th of that month, no le&s;s than 150 per&s;ons were &s;eized upon that account. One Ro&s;e, in a private congregation at London, had prayed, "That God would turn the Queen's heart from idolatry to the true faith, or el&s;e to &s;horten her days, or take her quickly out of the way;" this &s;erved for a colour to an act declaring &s;uch malicious prayers to be trea&s;on. The imagining or compa&s;&s;ing to deprive Philip of the &s;tile of <HI>King of England</HI> was made the like offence, and the publi&s;hing in words, that he ought not to enjoy the title, &s;ubjected the per&s;on to perpetual impri&s;on|ment.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Queen thought her&s;elf &s;ure of getting Philip recognized as pre&s;umptive heir of the crown, or at lea&s;t to get the admini&s;tration put into his hands, that he might di&s;po&s;e of the trea|&s;ure and forces of the nation at his will: but &s;he found her&s;elf di&s;appointed; not being able &s;o much as to pro|cure for him the crown of Queen con&s;ort. The King fully expected to be crowned, and with this view made great court to the hou&s;e of Commons; but they un|animou&s;ly rejected the propo&s;al. Philip and Mary were both &s;o incen&s;ed, that they went, with a &s;mall train, on January 16, to di&s;&s;olve the parliament, without any ceremony; &s;hewing all the world how much they were di&s;contented at it, notwith&s;tanding its compliance with all their de&s;ires in point of religion: but that &s;eems but to have been a &s;econdary view with either of them.</P>
<P>Soon after the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament, &s;everal gentlemen were relea&s;ed from the Tower, at Philip's interce&s;&s;ion, who had been confined, either for Wyat's
<PB N="214" REF="229">in&s;urrection, or &s;ome other rea&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal of the&s;e were Holgate, Archbi&s;hop of York, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton (who had been tried and acquitted on account of Wyat's rebellion, but neverthele&s;s kept in pri&s;on), Sir Gawen Carew, the Lord Henry Dudley, Sir G. Harper, Sir Edmund Warner, Sir James Crofts, Sir Nicholas Arnold, and Sir William St. Low.</NOTE>. He is &s;aid like|wi&s;e to have interceded for the Princ&egrave;&s;s Elizabeth, that her guard might be taken off, and &s;he brought to court: but Gardiner, her mortal enemy, oppo&s;ed it at fir&s;t, as not proper whil&s;t the parliament was &s;itting, and found means to defer it a good while longer. Philip was willing to oblige her, in hopes of making her &s;erviceable to his purpo&s;e, if his Queen &s;hould die: and &s;he owed her life to his fear of Mary Stuart's &s;uc|ceeding, in that ca&s;e, to the crown of England.</P>
<P>After the laws again&s;t the Lollards were revived, they were &s;oon put in execution.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Burnings for reli|gion.</NOTE> The alli|ance between the Pope and England (&s;ays M. de Noailles) was confirmed, on February 4, by the burning of Dr. John Rogers, Preben|dary of St. Paul's (who had &s;aved Bourne, now Bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells) in Smithfield: he went with &s;uch calmne&s;s and re&s;olution to the &s;take, that he was admired and applauded by the greate&s;t part of the &s;pectators, who, glorying in his con&s;tancy, &s;houted for joy on the occa&s;ion, as if he had been going to a wed|ding. Five days after (February 9) Dr. Rowland Taylor was burnt at Hadley, in Suffolk, where he had been Vicar, and had ventured to oppo&s;e &s;ome Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, who celebrated ma&s;s in his church. Stephen Gardiner, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who acted as Chan|cellor, Prime Mini&s;ter, and chief coun&s;ellor to the Queen, being informed of his behaviour, &s;ent for him to London, where he reviled him with the epi|thers of traitor, villain, heretic, and knave, and com|mitted him to the King's Bench pri&s;on, from which he
<PB N="215" REF="230">was, in a few days, brought to his trial, when he was condemned to be burned in his own pari&s;h. When he was conducted to the &s;take, and began to harangue the by-&s;tanders, one of the guards &s;truck him on the head. Then he was fixed in a barrel of pitch, and one of the &s;pectators throwing a &s;tick at the old man, which w&oacute;unded him &s;o &s;everely that his vi&s;age was covered with blood, he replied, "Oh friend, I have harm enough, what needed that?" When he repeated a p&s;alm in Engli&s;h, one of the guards &s;truck him on the mouth, bidding him &s;peak Latin; and while he was employed in ejaculation, another clove his head with an halbert in &s;uch a manner, that his brains came out, and he expired. John Cordmaker, Chancellor of the church of Wells, and John Bradford (another of Bourne's pre&s;ervers) &s;uffered afterwards in the &s;ame manner at London, and Laurence Saunders, who was par&s;on of Allhallows in Bread-&s;treet, London, and de&s;cended of a gentleman's family, was burned at Coventry. John Hooper, Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, was burned at the capital of his dioce&s;e, on February 9.

<PB N="216" REF="231">of St. David's, was tried at Caermarthen by Henry Morgan, who had been promoted to his &s;ee, and con|demned him as an heretic, for marrying after being a profe&s;&s;ed religious, for maintaining ju&s;tification by faith only, and for denying tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and the pro|pitiatory &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s. He was fir&s;t brought before Gardiner, and it is thought that if he had then managed with dexterity, and been &s;mooth in his an|&s;wers, he might have di&s;engaged him&s;elf, and &s;ecured his con&s;cience and life. When before Morgan, he ap|pealed to Cardinal Pole, who was aver&s;e to religious butchery; but Morgan would not allow his appeal. He &s;uffered with great con&s;tancy at Caermarthen, on March 30, and put the truth of his doctrine on a very bold te&s;t: for he told a gentleman of his acquaintance, that if he perceived him unea&s;y under the pain, or &s;o much as once &s;tir in the fire, he &s;hould not believe any of his tenets. He acted as courageou&s;ly as he &s;poke; and though his hands were burned off, he never &s;o much as moved, till a by-&s;tander knocked him down. Gar|diner ob&s;erving that the execution of the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics &s;erved only to increa&s;e the zeal of the Prote&s;tants, and excite murmurings among the people, transferred to Bonner, Bi&s;hop of London, the commi&s;&s;ion he had received from the Queen for extirpating here&s;y, and from which he could expect nothing but the public hatred. In &s;o doing he let loo&s;e the mo&s;t &s;avage mini&s;ter of vengeance upon the reformed; for the zeal of Gar|diner was cruel, but that of Bonner was furious.</P>
<P>In the morning of April 30, all the bells in London
<PB N="217" REF="232">rang for joy of the Queen's delivery. <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung at St. Paul's, bonfires,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Report of the Queen's delivery.</NOTE> pub|lic fea&s;tings, and other expre&s;&s;ions of joy, were made in all parts of the city: and one preacher, the curate of St. Anne's near Alder&s;gate, went &s;o far, as to give a particular account of the pro|portion and features of the young Prince, repre&s;enting him as the &s;tronge&s;t, the fine&s;t, and mo&s;t amiable child in nature. But all this joy was &s;oon damped by the more certain advice that the Queen's big belly was only the effects of a mole. She indeed was &s;o much out of order, and eat &s;o very little, that the phy&s;icians &s;aid, her child could have no &s;u&s;tenance, nor be brought into the world alive. They flattered her with hopes of being brought to bed on June 25, and, when that day came, they per&s;uaded her, that &s;he had mi&s;count|ed two months; which &s;he was the readier to believe, becau&s;e her hu&s;band had promi&s;ed to &s;tay with her till &s;he was delivered. The Emperor was dangerou&s;ly ill, laid up of the gout all over his body. He wanted to &s;ettle his affairs, and, &s;ending for his &s;on, furni&s;hed him with &s;o ju&s;t a rea&s;on for a journey to Flanders, that it could not be oppo&s;ed. Philip was quite tired of his wife, who kept him &s;o continually with her, that, from the time of their marriage, they had never been a&s;under, day nor night, except at meals: &s;he was grown very lean, pale, wan, and &s;plenetic; incon&s;o|lable at the thoughts of lo&s;ing her hu&s;band, &s;he wept continually: but all hopes of her child-bearing being over at the latter end of Augu&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip goes to Flanders.</NOTE> he re&s;ol|ved to &s;et out for Flanders; and accord|ingly leaving Whitehall on Augu&s;t 26, he pa&s;&s;ed through London in his way to Greenwich, the Legate on his left hand, and the Queen behind in an open litter. This parade was de&s;igned to convince the world that the Queen was in no danger; it being no ea&s;y matter to make the people believe truth, after be|ing long impo&s;ed on by artifices. Philip, on the 29th
<PB N="218" REF="233">of the month, took leave of Queen, promi&s;ing a &s;peedy return in about a fortnight, and de&s;iring Pole not to &s;tir from her during his ab&s;ence. He &s;taid at Canterbury five or &s;ix days, much to her di&s;&s;atisfaction, waiting till his equipage was ready to &s;ail for Flanders: but, parting on Wedne&s;day, September 4, from Dover, in the morning, he lay that night at Calais. In his letter from thence, he recommended the Prince&s;s Eli|zabeth, as well to the Queen's good graces, as to the care of the Spaniards he had left behind; being afraid &s;he &s;hould be put to death, and having now entertain|ed thoughts of marrying her on his wife's decea&s;e, who&s;e big belly turned to a drop&s;y.</P>
<P>The cruel per&s;ecution &s;till raged in Eng|land;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Per&s;ecution of the re|formed,</NOTE> and was indeed continued to the end of this reign, more or le&s;s bloody, at dif|ferent times, according to the circum&s;tances of affairs, and at different places, according to the tem|per of the Bi&s;hops, who were charged with the execu|tion of the &s;tatutes again&s;t here&s;y in their re&s;pective dioce&s;es. In all tho&s;e of the province of York, there &s;uffered only one per&s;on, who was burnt at Che&s;ter, and not more in the dioce&s;es of Exeter, Wells, Peter|borough, and Lincoln; very few in tho&s;e of Wales, two in Ely, three in Bri&s;tol, as many in Sali&s;bury, and none at all in tho&s;e of Oxford, Glouce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Hereford. The chief per&s;ecutors were Chri&s;topher|&s;on, Baine, and Griffi$h, Bi&s;hops of Chiche&s;ter, Lich|field, and Roche&s;ter, Thorndon Suffragan of Dover, Harpsfield Archdeacon of Canterbury, and above all Bonner Bi&s;hop of London, who, without di&s;tinction of &s;ex or age, burnt, within three years, no le&s;s than 200 per&s;ons. The inhuman barbarity of Jacques Amy, Dean of Guern&s;ey, is &s;o unparalleled in all the heathen per&s;ecutions of the Chri&s;tians, that it ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence. Ob&s;erving that Catherine Gouches, a poor widow, and her two daughters, ab&s;ented them&s;elves from church, he &s;ummoned them before
<PB N="219" REF="234">him: and finding that they had, in the late reign, been taught &s;ome of the reformed opinions, pro|nounced them heretics, and condemned them to the fire, though they offered to comply with the Queen's religion. One of the daughters being with child, in the mid&s;t of the flames and angui&s;h of the tor|ments, her belly brake a&s;under, and a goodly boy dropt into the fire, but was immediately &s;natched up by W. Hou&s;e, one of the by-&s;tanders. On the news of this &s;trange accident, one Go&s;ling, bailiff of the i&s;land, and executor of the Dean's &s;entence, ordered the babe to be ca&s;t again into the flames, that there might remain no i&s;&s;ue of an heretical parent. The whole number of tho&s;e that &s;uffered at the &s;take in this reign, is computed at 284; be&s;ides &s;uch as were thought to be made away with in pri&s;on, and &s;ome hundreds killed by &s;tarving, &s;tinks, and various kinds of tortures and hard&s;hips: to &s;ay nothing of 800 exiles. The&s;e cruelties had not the effect propo&s;ed; they made men &s;erious in religion, and to &s;u&s;pect the wor&s;t of Popery, as it was &s;upported with &s;uch barbarities; and the univer&s;al con&s;tancy which appeared in the martyrs, gave many of their adver&s;a|ries a good opinion of the doctrines, which they atte&s;t|ed with their blood, and brought them over to the re|formation. Philip, afraid that the odium of all the&s;e cruelties would fall upon him, had made his confe&s;&s;or Alphon&s;o, a Spani&s;h Franci&s;can friar, in a &s;ermon be|fore him, inveigh bitterly again&s;t &s;uch &s;avage and un|profitable cruelties, which, far from making converts, would only create an abhorrence of their religion. It is very probable, that he did not encourage them, be|cau&s;e they interfered with his political views, by in|crea&s;ing the aver&s;ion which the nation had to his go|vernment: and, either for this rea&s;on, or from his own experience in Germany, the Emperor had ad|vi&s;ed the Queen, at her fir&s;t coming to the crown, to give no man any trouble on account of religion; but

The&s;e he was entirely for taking off, as the chief &s;upporters of the ordinary people: this he called <HI>laying the axe to the root of the tree;</HI> and had the &s;atisfaction, before his death, of &s;eeing his advice followed in the execu|tion of two Bi&s;hops, Ridley and Latimer. They had been removed, with Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, the la&s;t year, in April, from the Tower to Oxford; where they were to di&s;pute with &s;ix divines, deputed by the lower hou&s;e of convocation, and as many learned doctors, culled out of each of the univer&s;ities, on the following que&s;tions:

</LIST> They had but two days allowed them to prepare for the di&s;putation, were de|barred all acce&s;s to one another, not &s;uffered to have the u&s;e of their own books and papers; and kept in &s;uch uncomfortable places, as differed little from com|mon dungeons. Each of them was appointed a par|ticular day, that they might not a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, if there had been occa&s;ion: Cranmer's was April 16;
<PB N="221" REF="236">Ridley's 17, and Latimer's the day following. They were not allowed to oppo&s;e, but confined only to the part of the re&s;pondents; in which they met with con|tinual interruptions, and &s;uch tumultuous clamours, revilings, &s;houts, and outcries, as were never known in any learned a&s;&s;embly. They all acquitted them|&s;elves to the wonder, even, of their adver&s;aries: but, when this formality was over, they were called on Friday, April 20, before Dr. We&s;ton (who had &s;at pre&s;ident at the di&s;putations, and now &s;at with the re&s;t in the nature of judges) to know whether they would &s;ub&s;cribe to the articles, in the popi&s;h &s;en&s;e, and, upon their refu&s;al, were condemned as heretics. There was no law, at that time in being, that could take away their lives: and the matters re&s;ted till Sep|tember 12, this year; when Cranmer was convened, in St. Mary's church, before Brooks, Bi&s;hop of Glou|ce&s;ter, &s;itting as the Pope's &s;ub-delegate, and the Doc|tors Martin and Story, the King and Queen's com|mi&s;&s;ioners. To the&s;e la&s;t he made his reverence; but &s;hewed no re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, as acting by commi&s;&s;ion from the Pope, who&s;e &s;upremacy he had abjured. Several articles were propo&s;ed to him, which he did not deny; but &s;tood upon his ju&s;tification in point of doctrine. Upon the whole, he was cited before the Pope in eighty days: and, having expre&s;&s;ed his wil|lingne&s;s to do &s;o, if the King and Queen would give him leave, he was remanded to pri&s;on. White, Brooks, and Holyman, Bi&s;hops of Lincoln, Glouce&s;ter, and Bri&s;tol, &s;itting by virtue of the legate's commi&s;&s;ion eight days after, condemned Ridley and Latimer to be degraded from their epi&s;copal, prie&s;tly, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical, orders, and to be delivered over to the &s;ecular arm for puni&s;hment. The &s;entence was executed; and they were burnt, on October 16, in the Town-ditch over again&s;t Baliol college.</P>
<P>Gardiner died, on November 12, at midnight, to the no &s;mall grief of the Queen, who lo&s;t in him her
<PB N="222" REF="237">able&s;t coun&s;ellor, and one that had more influence, than all the re&s;t, on the parliament; but to the great joy of the people. He had been at the opening of the parliament on Monday, October 21, and declared the cau&s;e of its meeting to be granting aid to their Maje&s;ties: but not being able to attend the hou&s;e above two days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, in his Martyrology, tells a &s;tory which he pretended to have had from good authority, that the &s;ame day on which Ridley and Latimer &s;uffered, Gardiner would not go to dinner till his &s;er|vants, who were po&s;ted on the road for that purpo&s;e, had brought him notice that the faggots were kindled about them: that this bar|barous fancy made the dinner be kept back till four o'clock in the afternoon, although the old Duke of Norfolk was unea&s;y for &s;taying &s;o long: that when Gardiner heard the two prelates were burning, he was tran&s;ported at the news, and went immediately to dinner, but was &s;uddenly &s;eized at table, and thence carried to bed, where he continued fifteen days, without voiding any thing by urine, or otherwi&s;e, which cau&s;ed his tongue to &s;well.&mdash;What is faithfully related above, is &s;ufficient to confute this tragical relation, with re|&s;pect to his confinement. Be&s;ides, the Duke of Norfolk, there mentioned, died on Augu&s;t 25 the preceding year; and Bi&s;hop Goodwin relates that Gardiner died of the gout, and not of a &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of urine. He is &s;aid to have felt &s;ome remor&s;e in his la&s;t mome$$s, and to have exclaimed, "I have finned with Peter, but I have not wept with Peter." This prelate, though he took the &s;urname of Gardiner, was natural &s;on of Lionel Wideville, Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, and brother to Elizabeth, con&s;ort to Edward IV.</NOTE>, the Lord Trea&s;urer &s;eems, in virtue of his office, to have &s;upplied the place of Speaker of the hou&s;e of Lords, during the re&s;t of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and at la&s;t, by the Queen's orders, declared the par|liament di&s;&s;olved, without any particular commi&s;&s;ion for the&s;e purpo&s;es. The great &s;eal was put into the cu&s;tody of Sir Nicholas Hare, till the beginning of January; when Ely and Paget being baulked of their preten&s;ions to the po&s;t, though the Emperor wrote in their favour, Heath Archbi&s;hop of York was made Lord Chancellor, by Pole's recommendation. It was not thought proper, that the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, al|though &s;he conformed to the Romi&s;h religion, &s;hould be about cou$t, or in town, whil&s;t the parliament was
<PB N="223" REF="238">&s;itting, le&s;t the nobility and gentry &s;hould &s;hew her too much re&s;pect and affection: and &s;he was &s;ent away from Greenwich, on Friday, October 18, to her country-hou&s;e, about thirty miles from London, to pa&s;s the winter. Her way lay through the city: and in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treets, &s;he was followed and huzza'd by prodigious crowds of people of all ranks, to the no &s;mall di&s;plea&s;ure of the Queen; who did not find her &s;i&s;ter's ab&s;ence any way le&s;&s;en the oppo&s;ition made to her mea&s;ures in parliament. She was very unea&s;y at the accounts &s;he received from Flanders, of her hu&s;band's a&s;&s;iduity in vi&s;iting younger ladies than her|&s;elf; and re&s;olved to get him back from thence if po&s;&s;ible. Nothing was &s;o likely to procure his return, as to get him crowned, and the government put into his hands: &s;he did her utmo&s;t to carry the&s;e points, but could not obtain the con&s;ent of parliament. The bull of Pope Paul IV. confirming what Cardinal Pole had done, for a&s;&s;uring the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of abbey and church lands to the laity who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, was read before both hou&s;es, on the &s;econd day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion: but it did not remove the ill humour of the Commons, nor make them more liberal in their &s;upplies.</P>
<P>Mary had applied all the money, &s;he could &s;crape together, to &s;upply her hu&s;band's nece&s;&s;ities, and left the va&s;t arrears due to her late brother's and her own &s;ervants of the hou&s;hold unpaid; &s;he was involved too in other heavy debts, and yet continually launching out into new expences. She had lately re-edified a Fran|ci&s;can convent at Greenwich; was going to build another for the Dominicans, and a third for the Car|thu&s;ians: &s;he de&s;igned likewi&s;e to found as many abbeys, as the lands, of &s;uch as had been di&s;&s;olved, &s;till remaining in the crown, would endow. It was with an ill grace, that, whil&s;t &s;he was thus alienating her ordinary revenue, &s;he applied to parliament for an extraordinary aid to pay her debts, particularly tho&s;e

<PB N="224" REF="241">of the hou&s;hold; in which probably a good number of the hou&s;e of Commons were per&s;onally intere&s;ted. Notwith&s;tanding this circum&s;tance, and the artifices of her mini&s;ter, with the pompous harangues, di&s;play|ing the &s;ervices, which the Queen and her hu&s;band had done to the nation, when the Comptroller and Secre|tary Petre, with the re&s;t of the committee appointed to con&s;ider of the &s;upply, had pre&s;ented a bill to the hou&s;e, for the grant of a &s;ub&s;idy of four &s;hillings in the pound, payable in two years, and two-fifteenths, it met with a very &s;trong oppo&s;ition. Very free &s;peeches were made on the occa&s;ion: and it appeared in an odious light, that &s;he &s;hould come to the laity for the payment of her debts, and the &s;upply of her extravagance, when &s;he was &s;quandering away the trea|&s;ure and revenue of the crown upon eccle&s;ia&s;tics. This objection lay equally again&s;t another bill, &s;he had at heart, though it was po&s;tponed till the expected &s;upply was granted: and the Queen, being afraid of lo&s;ing both, thought proper to &s;end a me&s;&s;age, on October 30, to the Commons, by Secretery Petre, declining the two-fifteenths, and de&s;iring only the &s;ub&s;idy.</P>
<P>Accordingly it was granted, though an hundred members were ab&s;olutely again&s;t giving any &s;upply. The Queen then, on November 19, &s;ending for both hou&s;es to Whitehall, acquainted them with her re&s;olu|tion of making a ce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> to the church, and re&s;igning the impropriations in her hands to the Legate's di&s;po&s;al, and de&s;ired them to pa&s;s an act for the&s;e purpo&s;es. This was a point, in which no inte|re&s;t but her own was immediately concerned; and yet the bill, which at fir&s;t contained a &s;urrender thereof to the Pope, though afterwards altered in this particu|lar, was debated for a fortnight together; meeting with &s;uch difficulties, that all the intrigues, treaties, managements, threats, and promi&s;es that could be u&s;ed, were &s;carce &s;ufficient to remove them, and the mini&s;ters dur&s;t not venture upon any other act to the prejudice
<PB N="225" REF="242">of the &s;ubject. The Queen had another &s;ubject of vexation given her by the Commons; who, upon a di|vi&s;ion, threw out a bill for attainting the per&s;ons, and for forfeiting the e&s;tates of the Duche&s;s of Suffolk, and all other Prote&s;tants, who had, &s;ince her acce&s;&s;ion, &s;led abroad, and taken refuge at Francfort, Stra&s;burgh, and others towns in Germany, if they contemptuou&s;ly refu&s;ed to return home, upon the King's and Queen's letters recalling them, or upon open proclamation made to that effect. No hou&s;e of Commons had ever ap|peared &s;o refractory before: and the Earl of Pembroke, the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, the Comptroller, with other of her favourites, were treated with &s;o much contempt, on the occa&s;ion, and her own conduct &s;o freely cen&s;ured, that, unable to bear contradiction any longer, &s;he put, on December 9, a premature end to the parliament. The clergy granted her a &s;ub&s;idy of &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound, payable in three years by equal portions; and expected to have their juri&s;diction, dignity, and re|venues re&s;tored to them; the Legate recommended it, the Queen &s;upported it with her in&s;tances, but neither prevailed.</P>
<P>The time a&s;&s;igned to Cranmer (who was all the while clo&s;ely confined in <HI>Bocardo,</HI> the north-gate pri|&s;on in Oxford) for his appearance at Rome expiring on December 10,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Archbi&s;hop Cranmer recants, and is burn|ed.</NOTE> he was pronounced contumacious: and the Pope, on December 11, provided Pole to the &s;ee of Canterbury; con&s;tituting him ad|mini&s;trator thereof, till he &s;hould be con&s;ecrated, and then appointing him Archbi&s;hop, with full power and juri&s;diction. That &s;ee had been vacant ever &s;ince Cran|mer's conviction of trea&s;on: but the Pope, having ex|communicated and deprived him for here&s;y, in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould be put to death on this account. The judges telling the Queen, that this Prelate was, after his attainder, a dead man in law, and could not be tried for any other crime, &s;he was forced to grant him
<PB N="226" REF="243">a pardon for trea&s;on, in order to have him pro&s;ecuted and burnt for here&s;y. A Papal commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent to Bonner and Thirlby for the trial of the Primate, and on conviction for degrading him; which la&s;t was done on February 14, 1556<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bonner, Bi&s;hop of London, and Thirlby, Bi&s;hop of Ely, being employed on this occa&s;ion, fir&s;t cloathed Cranmer with a mitre, pall, and other archiepi&s;copal ve&s;tments, all made of coar&s;e canvas. Thirlby wept bitterly during the whole &s;cene, prote&s;ting to the Archbi&s;hop, that it was the mo&s;t &s;orrowful action of his life; and that nothing, but the Queen's po&s;itive commands, could induce him to be pre&s;ent at the affliction and di&s;tre&s;s of a per&s;on with whom he ha$ lived in perfect friend&s;hip: but Bonner, having in&s;ulted him with very indecent raillery, ordered him to be &s;tripped of his ludi|crous attire, according to the ceremony of degradation u&s;ed in the church of Rome. See page 273 of vol. ii. of this work, for the form of degrading a prie&s;t, in the ca&s;e of William Sautre.</NOTE>; and, on the 24th of the &s;ame month, the Queen i&s;&s;ued a writ for the exe|cution of that &s;entence. It was thought of mighty &s;ervice to the Popi&s;h cau&s;e, to get him fir&s;t to recant; and great endeavours were u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, with a&s;&s;urance of life, and other promi&s;es, the performance whereof was never intended. The bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who teazed him on this &s;ubject, was, to draw him in at any rate; and they allowed him to frame a recan|tation in &s;uch a manner, as might &s;atisfy the govern|ment, and not be very &s;hocking to his own con&s;cie$ce: but, when he had &s;igned one paper, they &s;till wanted another to explain it, till he had &s;igned at la&s;t &s;ix wri|tings. The fir&s;t imported, "That, &s;ince the Pope's authority had been received in England by act of par|liament, he was content to &s;ubmit to the laws there|in, and to take the Pope for chief head of the church of England, <HI>&s;o far as God's laws, and the laws and cu&s;|toms of the realm would permit.</HI>" There was no &s;uch re&s;erve in the &s;econd, which contained "a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Catholic church of Chri&s;t, to the Pope as its &s;upreme head, to the King and Queen, and to all their laws and ordinances." The third expre&s;&s;ed "a pro|mi&s;e,
<PB N="227" REF="244">that he would promote the like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in others, and &s;ubmitted his book to the judgment of the Catholic church, and the next general council." The &s;ub&s;tance of the fourth was, "a general profe&s;&s;ion, that, with regard to the &s;acraments, and all points of the Chri&s;tian religion and Catholic &s;aith, he believed as the Catholic church did believe at that time, and had ever believed from the beginning." In the fifth, "he condemned all the heretical doctrines of Luther and Zuinglius:" and in the &s;ixth, "he acknowledged his offences again&s;t the Pope, the King, the Queen, the realm, and the univer&s;al church, particularly in the divorce of Henry VIII. in bla&s;pheming the eucha|ri&s;t, in denying Chri&s;t's body and blood to be truly and really contained under the &s;pecies of bread and wine, and in writing books again&s;t the truth." Notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e different writings of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re|cantation, it was re&s;olved to put him to death: but this was kept &s;ecret, till he &s;hould fir&s;t have made a public recantation in St. Mary's church, &s;tronger than what he had &s;igned in private, and particularly expre&s;|&s;ing his belief of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. He was carried to St. Mary's, on March 21, for that purpo&s;e: but in&s;tead of doing &s;o, he "ab&s;olutely renounced all the above writings, which fear of death had cau&s;ed him to &s;ign; and declared that as his hand had offended there|in contrary to his heart, it &s;hould, for that rea&s;on, be fir&s;t puni&s;hed. He went on, declaring again&s;t the Pope, with all his fal&s;e doctrine, and maintaining the true doctrine of the &s;acrament, as laid down in his book again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter;" when he was interrupted by the Lord Williams, and hurried away to the &s;take, going to it with a chearful countenance. He there again expre&s;&s;ed his repentance for the recan|tation he had &s;igned, and declared, that he died in all the opinions he had taught in his books. When fire was put to the pile, he &s;tretched out his right hand, and thru&s;t it into the flame; holding it there a good
<PB N="228" REF="245">while before the fire &s;eized any other part of his body, and crying with a loud voice, "This hand hath of|fended:" and what appeared &s;urpri&s;ing, his heart was found among the a&s;hes, uncon&s;umed and entire. His patience in the torment, and his courage in dying, were wonderful, and not outdone by any of the pri|mitive martyrs. He was a man of an open and gene|rous temper, exemplary and unaffected piety, of great abilities, learning and judgment; indefatigable in his &s;earches after truth; ab&s;temious in his own way of living, and &s;pending all his revenue in charity to the poor, and pen&s;ions to learned men abroad; admired by all, and generally beloved for his gentlene&s;s, mode|ration, humanity, and equanimity; con&s;tant to his friends in all circum&s;tances of their affairs, and gene|rous even to his enemies.</P>
<P>The day after his martyrdom, Pole was con&s;ecrated; and, on March 25, was inve&s;ted with the pall,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Cardinal Pole made Archbi|&s;hop of Can|terbury.</NOTE> in Bow-church, at London. He had held, &s;ome time before, a &s;ynod, by his legatine authority, for which he had the Queen's li$ence: and, having a&s;&s;igned &s;everal per&s;ons to compile homilies, and tran&s;|late the New Te&s;tament, publi&s;hed, in February, &s;ome canons (as they were termed) of reformation.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the lives of martyrs in this country were daily &s;pent in defending the doctrine, liturgy,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings of the Engli&s;h refugees abroad.</NOTE> and con&s;titution of the re|formed church of England, &s;ome of the Engli&s;h exiles abroad were labour|ing to &s;ubvert, or at lea&s;t to alter them according to their own fancies. The towns, where they chiefly &s;ettled, were Embden, Stra&s;burgh, Zurich, Geneva, Ba&s;il, and Francfort; being allowed the exerci&s;e of their religion, and keeping up the face of an Engli&s;h church in their congregations. In the three fir&s;t of the&s;e places they con&s;tantly u&s;ed the Engli&s;h liturgy: but in Francfort, where the magi&s;trates had a&s;&s;igned
<PB N="229" REF="246">them a church for divine wor&s;hip. Whitingham, Goodman, and other preachers, &s;et them&s;elves to di&s;|figure it, altering the confe&s;&s;ion and prayers, laying a&s;ide the liturgy, be&s;ides the reading of the p&s;alms and chapters. When they had agreed upon a form of their own (which they endeavoured afterwards to ob|trude upon the whole church of England) they invited the exiles at Stra&s;burgh and Zurich to repair to Franc|fort, and join in their wor&s;hip, but met with a refu&s;al; the latter having heard of their alterations, and &s;igni|fying their own re&s;olution of maintaining the order of the church of England. Knox, who had lately pub|li&s;hed &s;ome &s;editious pamphlets, in which the Empe|ror, as well as the King and Queen of England, were equalled to Nero for cruelty and per&s;ecution, came thither from Geneva: and inflamed them &s;o much a|gain&s;t the Engli&s;h liturgy, that all the endeavours of Grindal and Chambers for accommodating the diffe|rence, by per&s;uading them to retain the &s;ub&s;tance of it, though they laid a&s;ide the &s;urplice, and other ceremo|nies, proved ineffectual. Some of the&s;e &s;eparati&s;ts were for the Geneva office; but Know, who had pro|cured a letter from Calvin to di&s;parage the Engli&s;h liturgy, would needs have a form of his own; think|ing him&s;elf full as able as Calvin to make a rule for his own congregation. At la&s;t they agreed on a mixed form, taken partly from the Engli&s;h, and partly from the Geneva offices, to be u&s;ed for a time, till a better cour&s;e could be taken. Dr. Richard Cox, late Dean of Chri&s;t church and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and one of the compilers of the Engli&s;h liturgy, coming about this time with many Engli&s;h exiles to Francfort, endea|voured to revive the u&s;e of it: and, being a man of great learning, dignity, and authority, obtained an order from the &s;enate, enjoining Whitingham, and the re&s;t of his faction, to receive the Engli&s;h &s;ervice. They cho&s;e rather to retire after Knox, who had quir|ted the place, to avoid a pro&s;ecution for trea&s;on again&s;t
<PB N="230" REF="247">the Emperor: and Cox, re&s;toring the liturgy, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;uch an order in the congregation, as might keep up the face of an Engli&s;h church: Whi$ehead being cho&s;en principal Pa&s;tor, and Horn, Mullings, and Trahorn, appointed Hebrew, Greek, and Divi|nity Lecturers. Whitingham, with the re&s;t of the faction, retiring to Geneva, cho&s;e Knox and Goodman for their con&s;tant preachers; and, ca&s;ting off the whole frame of the Engli&s;h reformation, adopted that of Ge|neva, with &s;ome of Calvin's doctrines. Cox removing to Stra&s;burgh, where his old friend P. Martyr lived, a new di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e in his ab&s;ence. He had, in de|fect of a Bi&s;hop, e&s;tabli&s;hed, by general con&s;ent, the power of exerci&s;ing eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline in the chief Pa&s;tor, two other Pre&s;byters, and four Deacons, as a&s;&s;i&s;tants: and had, upon Whitehead's quitting his charge, got Mr. Horn appointed chief Pa&s;tor. A&s;h|ley, a gentleman of figure in the lay-&s;ect of the flock, had, in the beginning of this year, been cen&s;ured for &s;ome words expre&s;&s;ing a contempt of the mini&s;try: and not bearing this rebuke, made an appeal to the congregation, in which he had &s;uch intere&s;t, that a number of laymen, meeting together, &s;ent two of their company to the chief Pa&s;tor, and con&s;i&s;tory, re|quiring them to proceed no further. Horn, &s;upport|ed by Chambers, Trea&s;urer of the contributions, ex|cepted to this me&s;&s;age, as &s;ent from a private conven|ticle of A&s;hley's partizans, and not approved by the general con&s;ent of the congregation: and re&s;olved to in&s;i&s;t upon the authority conferred upon him and his co$a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors by the rules of di&s;cipline which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. A&s;hley and his adherents prote&s;ted again&s;t them, as an adver&s;e party, and for that rea&s;on inca|pable of acting in the ca&s;e as judges: and &s;et about forming a new &s;cheme of di&s;cipline, calculated, as they pretended, for curbing the exorbitant power of the Pa&s;tor and his colleagues, who thereupon quitted their offices. The faction was proceeding to elect others in
<PB N="231" REF="248">their &s;tead, and to e&s;tabli&s;h their new di&s;cipline, when the magi&s;trates of Francfort re&s;tored the old ones to their fomer authority by a public edict. A&s;hley's party oppo&s;ed this, and &s;et up the di&s;cipline they had devi&s;ed, putting the &s;upreme power in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es into the hands of the congregation, and committing the di&s;po&s;al of the public money to certain officers, whom they termed Deacons. The breach being made wider by the contention between &s;uch as were for retaining the old, and tho&s;e that would introduce the new di&s;|cipline, the magi&s;trates &s;ent to Stra&s;burgh for Dr. Cox, Dr. Sandys, and R. Bertie, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to make up the difference, both parties agreeing to &s;ubmit the contro|ver&s;y to their arbitration. A form of reconciliation was drawn up: but the partizans of the new di&s;cipline, being grown more numerous than the others, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to any e&s;tabli&s;hment, by which the power of the diffu&s;ive body of the congregation, then of a fluc|tuating nature, as exiles flocked to the place, or re|moved their abode, might be called in que&s;tion. They likewi&s;e elected new mini&s;ters: nor could all the re|mon&s;trances &s;ent from Stra&s;burgh deter them from going on in their mea&s;ures for maintaining a divi&s;ion among per&s;ons, whom their common &s;ufferings ought to have united, and for vilifying, in the eyes of fo|reigners, the reformation, which had been carried on in their own country, and was daily recommended by the blood of martyrs. Such was the beginning of the &s;everal factions of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> again&s;t the rites and ceremonies of the church of England. The&s;e &s;eparations gave way likewi&s;e to innovations in doc|trine; the exiles, which retired to Geneva, &s;etting a|bout a new tran&s;lation of the Bible, and intermixing in their notes &s;everal heterodox notions, &s;ome of a &s;e|ditious nature, with regard to the civil magi&s;trate, and others as &s;candalous in re&s;pect to epi&s;copacy. The Calvinian doctrines of ab&s;olute prede&s;tination and re|probation, making <HI>God the author of &s;in, and all the wick|edne&s;s
<PB N="232" REF="249">upon earth,</HI> either in expre&s;s terms, or by unde|niable con&s;equence, now al&s;o began to be propagated in pamphlets publi&s;hed by the re&s;ugees at Geneva.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the per&s;ecution in England con|tinued to rage; to the great prejudice of the Queen's affairs, increa&s;ing the di&s;affection to her government, and rendering the di&s;affected de&s;perate. Whatever plea&s;ure &s;he had received from the burning of Cran|mer, in revenge of her mother's divorce, it was not an equivalent to the anxiety &s;he felt on account of her hu&s;band's ab&s;ence. Philip lo&s;ing all hopes of having children by the Queen, and having taken a di&s;like to her per&s;on, &s;hewed no inclination of returning to England: and had by degrees &s;ent for his furniture, his guards, and all his &s;ervants from thence, leaving only &s;ome of his band of mu&s;ic with her, and Don Diego Agneda, who was obliged to &s;tay to di&s;charge the debts of his hou&s;hold. What vexed her the more, was, that he had no occa&s;ion for them in Flanders, &s;ince they were not ordered thither. She did all &s;he could to prevent their going: and her ill &s;ucce&s;s in this co&s;t her abundance of tears, with all the re|mon&s;trances and complaints that could come from a woman tormented with an extreme pa&s;&s;ion, and having no way of revenging the ingratitude of a foreign hu&s;band, whom &s;he had, out of ambition, and an unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion, cho&s;en and purcha&s;ed at an exce&s;&s;ive expence, contrary to the &s;en&s;e of her people, the intere&s;t of the nation, the laws of the land, and the will of her father. The fury, however, rai&s;ed on this occation, &s;pent it&s;elf, not on him, but on her &s;ubjects, whom &s;he hated, laying upon them the blame of his going abroad; becau&s;e they would not con&s;ent, either to his being crowned, even in the quality of a con&s;ort, or to &s;ettle him in the &s;ull enjoyment of the government, without which he could not make the figure he de&s;ired in England. Having little hopes of his return, unle&s;s &s;he carried the&s;e points, &s;he re&s;umed
<PB N="233" REF="250">the de&s;ign: and it was propo&s;ed to hold a parliament, in March, for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>One William Con&s;table, alias Feather|&s;tone, a miller's &s;on,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Plots again&s;t the Queen.</NOTE> much of an age with the late King Edward, and re&s;embling him in per&s;on, had been publickly whipt about a year be|fore in London, for pretending to be really that Prince: and, vanity rendering him incorrigible, he was taken up again for the &s;ame offence, condemned of-trea&s;on on February 26, and executed on March 3, being drawn to pieces by four hor&s;es in Smithfield. A di&s;|covery was made, about the &s;ame time, that one of her chaplains had undertaken to kill her; but as the honour of her religion might &s;uffer by the puni&s;hment of a Ro|mi&s;h prie&s;t for &s;o black a crime, the matter was &s;mothe|red. Another plot for robbing the exchequer of &s;ome Spani&s;h money there lodged, with a view of employ|ing it towards rai&s;ing an in&s;urrection, was di&s;covered &s;oon after by White, one of the con&s;pirators: and John Throckmorton, Richard Uddel, Henry Peckham, John Daniel, W. Ro&s;&s;ey, W. Stanton, John Dethic, John Bedel, were condemned for it, and executed. Some fled into France: and Sir Anthony King&s;ton was ap|prehended, but died on the road in coming to London.</P>
<P>Endeavours were u&s;ed to involve the Prince&s;s Eliza|beth in this con&s;piracy; and, either upon this ac|count, or becau&s;e, upon a &s;earch of her hou&s;e in town, &s;ome forbidden books had been found in a coffer, a guard had been &s;et on her per&s;on. Be&s;ides Peckham, Worne her hou&s;e-&s;teward, and another of her hou&s;e|&s;ervants, were taken up and condemned: but what they &s;aid of her was &s;o &s;light, that the Queen thought fit to &s;end orders for di&s;charging the guard, and to write her an account of the &s;ub&s;tance of their depo&s;i|tions, profe&s;&s;ing, that &s;he did not believe a word of their contents, and recommending to her Pope and Gage, in&s;tead of her &s;ervants that had been condemn|ed. This was accompanied with a pre&s;ent of a ring,
<PB N="234" REF="251">worth 6 or 700 crowns; and the Lord Loughborough was &s;ent, with Sir Francis Englefield, to bring her up to court: but the Prince&s;s excu&s;ed her&s;elf from going. There was at that time a project actually under con&s;i|deration, for tran&s;porting her either to Flanders or Spain; the execution of which was prevented by the interce&s;&s;ion of the French amba&s;&s;ador with Car|dinal Pole, who was of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, and aver&s;e to har&s;h mea&s;ures. It was a circum&s;tance very dangerous for the Prince&s;s, as well as the Earl of Devon, that they were univer&s;ally beloved; and their names were made u&s;e of, without their know|ledge, by every mad fellow that wanted to rai&s;e the populace; as was done &s;ometime after at Ip&s;wich; where they were proclaimed King and Queen of Eng|land, and eight or ten of the rioters &s;eized.</P>
<P>The Queen's jealou&s;y was inflamed to the highe&s;t pitch at the&s;e con&s;piracies, and the knowledge of her being generally hated. She knew not who to tru&s;t, and took up all that &s;he &s;u&s;pected, either of dabbling in the&s;e plots, or having favoured Wyat's in&s;urrection. The Tower was filled with pri&s;oners of di&s;tinction: and, though the Lord Thomas Howard and Captain Randel were &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the Lord Bray and others were confined, till no colour was left to doubt of their innocence. She took care to be attended by her guards: and would let her&s;elf be &s;een only in her chamber by five women, pa&s;&s;ing the night in tears, complaints, and in writing letters to draw her hu&s;band over; in|cen&s;ed again&s;t all her &s;ubjects, a&s;toni&s;hed at the infide|lity of tho&s;e who had mo&s;t of her confidence, and jealous of her &s;ervants, becau&s;e they were generally either related or allied to the nobility, and likely to adopt their &s;entiments. Lord Clinton the Admiral (who did not indeed like the &s;tiffne&s;s of the ceremonial at her court, and her ungracions behaviour to men of quality, and was apprehen&s;ive that her hatred of her people, and theirs in return, would, with its divi&s;ions, cau&s;e the ruin of the nation) though en|tru&s;ted
<PB N="235" REF="252">with the command of the &s;leet, did not e&s;cape &s;u&s;picion. Even the Lords of her council were in the &s;ame &s;ituation: and &s;he was &s;o enraged at them, that &s;he could not forbear &s;aying things &s;hocking to them, and much to her own di&s;advantage; as, that <HI>&s;he tru&s;ted none of them, but the Lord</HI> Montacute <HI>and the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e,</HI> two young men, not well qualified to extri|cate her out of difficulties.</P>
<P>Mary was, likewi&s;e, terribly apprehen&s;ive le&s;t France &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the malecontents. She had frequently demanded that the Engli&s;h refugees in that country, whom &s;he repre&s;ented as abominable heretics, &s;hould be delivered up to her: and, in her expo&s;tulations with the French amba&s;&s;ador on the &s;ubject, was &s;o eager for being gratified therein, that the lea&s;t contradiction would have thrown her into a fury. Henry I$. had too much magnanimity to comply with her demand, and give up a number of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed exiles to her rage: but, faithful to his treaties, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with affording them a protection, and entered into no mea|&s;ures with them to her prejudice.</P>
<P>So many promi&s;es had Philip made, of coming over to England, that the Queen, though &s;he infi|nitely longed for &s;uch an interview, now believed none of them. Don John Mendo&s;a came over, in July, with compliments to the Queen, and fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of her hu&s;band's return before the end of Augu&s;t. The&s;e were clogged with &s;ome conditions or precau|tions, &s;ugge&s;ted by a pretended fear for the &s;afety of his per&s;on during his &s;tay, and expre&s;&s;ed in a demand, that &s;he would &s;end over &s;ix or &s;even elde&s;t &s;ons of the prime nobility to Flanders, there to remain as ho&s;tages for his &s;ecurity: but this was impracticable; nor was it a point in which he could rea&s;onably expect to be gratified. Mary looked on it as mere &s;huffling, and, in a fit of rage, tore his picture: but her revenge fell more heavily on the reformed; Bonner being the bloody in&s;trument of her fury. Above eighty per&s;ons,
<PB N="236" REF="253">&s;ome of them gentlemen, being brought in one week from different parts of the realm to London, M. de Noailles the French amba&s;&s;ador &s;ays, thirty or forty were pre&s;ently burnt in about the &s;ame &s;pace of time, all dying firm in their opinions. Nothing could be more impolitic than &s;uch per&s;ecution; for opinions are often rive$ted by oppo&s;ition. The indignation of all moderate people was rou&s;ed by the&s;e proceedings; the &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution, with which the victims &s;uffered the mo&s;t painful death, diffu&s;ed a general notion of the &s;anctity, and inhanced the merit of the religion which they profe&s;&s;ed: &s;o that this frantic zeal of their per&s;e|cutors contributed, in a great mea&s;ure, to the &s;ub&s;e|quent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the reformed religion.</P>
<P>Thinking to atone for her &s;ins by &s;ome acts of piety, Mary erected a convent for Carthu&s;ians at Shene, and another for the Dominican or Black Friers in Smith|field. The ho&s;pital of the Savoy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 353 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE> was now &s;itted up, and anew endowed by the Queen: her maids of ho|nour, and other ladies about court, contributing to furni&s;h it with bedding and other nece&s;&s;aries. The old convent at Sion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 286 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE> was repleni&s;hed with nuns; and a &s;ufficient e&s;tate in land a&s;&s;igned for their maintenance. We&s;ton was forced to &s;urrender his deanery of We&s;t|min&s;ter; and the chapter being di&s;&s;olved, the convent was on November 21 re&s;tored, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen monks, be&s;ides Dr. John Fecknam, who was made abbot at the &s;ame time. What had been left of the church and priory of St. John of Jeru&s;alem<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See pages 20 and 113 of this volume.</NOTE> near Smithfield, was re&s;tored in the year following: and Sir Thomas Tre&s;ham being made grand prior, a libe|ral endowment was a&s;&s;igned for the honourable &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of the knights of the order. Sir Thomas, dying &s;oon after, was &s;ucceeded by Sir Richard Shelley, who was the la&s;t grand ma&s;ter in England. Eight
<PB N="237" REF="254">other abbeys were likewi&s;e new founded; and endowed out of the lands of the di&s;&s;olved mona&s;teries, which as yet remained in the hands of the crown.

The extraordinary methods, which &s;he took to fill her coffers, and the di&s;agreeable manner of retrenching her expences, cau&s;ed a general di&s;content, which &s;hewed it&s;elf, as on former occa&s;ions, in libels and &s;atires, whereof many were thrown into the lodg|ings of her coun&s;ellors, and dropped in her Maje&s;ty's own chamber<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other pieces, there were pictures repre&s;enting her naked, meager, wrinkled, and withered, with flabby brea&s;ts hanging down to a di&s;gu&s;tful length, &s;itting in a toyal chair, and on her head a crown, with M.

Mary was heartily vexed at this droll and &s;atirical piece, and yet &s;o extremely afraid of its being publi&s;hed, that, to keep it &s;ecret, &s;he got in all the pictures that were found about her palace, chu&s;ing rather to &s;uffer the affront than com|plain of it openly, in order to di&s;cover the authors.

<P>A war having broke out between France and Spain, Philip endeavoured to embark England in it, by flat|tering the Queen with hopes of his &s;peedy coming over: and &s;ent, about the middle of December, &s;ome of his harbingers to prepare matters for his arrival.
<PB N="238" REF="255">Mary, to oblige him, ordered thirty-five or forty new &s;hips to be built, and the Tower to be filled with bows, arrows, arquebu&s;es, pikes, cor&s;elets, and other arms, of which it was at that time unprovided: and, to divert the hatred of the nation from the Spaniards to the French, the judges were in&s;tructed to load the&s;e la&s;t with calumnies, and to alarm the people with frightful repre&s;entations of the calamities they might ex|pect from a French inva&s;ion, encouraged by the refugees in that country holding corre&s;pondence with England. The Earl of Pembroke and Lord Grey were as eager for a war as Mary her&s;elf, being military men, &s;ure to have the chief command of the forces, and wanting to touch her money: but the re&s;t of the council were generally aver&s;e to a war that could not but be ex|tremely prejudicial to the kingdom. They &s;aw &s;he could have no children, and did not care what became of the realm, if &s;he could but put it into her hu&s;band's hands: they had no affection for Philip, and did not care to embark in a war for the &s;ervice of a Prince, who&s;e power was already formidable, and filled them with &s;uch &s;u&s;picions, that they knew not well whether to wi&s;h him &s;ucce&s;s or ruin. In ca&s;e of the former, they were likely to be the fir&s;t that would feel the in|&s;olence of victory, though they &s;hould be the fir&s;t in|&s;truments of obtaining it, and a way would be paved for their perpetual &s;ervitude; and, if matters went ill, the nation would be &s;o impoveri&s;hed by taxes, to de|fray the charges of war, that the crown would be in danger of falling a prey to the conqueror. They re|pre&s;ented to the Queen, that the nation was in great di&s;tre&s;s by a dearth, greater than had been known in an hundred years pa&s;t, through the failure of the la&s;t harve&s;t, the effect of too dry a &s;ummer, corn being rai&s;ed to &s;ix or &s;even times its u&s;ual price, and the common people obliged to eat bread made of acorns; that the people, ever aver&s;e to taxes, would be more &s;o in &s;uch a &s;ituation; that a war would be ruinous in
<PB N="239" REF="256">every re&s;pect, and was particularly dangerous when they had as much to fear within the realm as without. The&s;e repre&s;entations had no other effect on Mary, than to throw her into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and provoke her to a declaration, that if France broke with her hu&s;band, &s;he would, whatever was the con&s;equence, execute her father's treaties with the Emperor, and defend the Low Countries.</P>

Even in religion, though his particular province, he let the Bi&s;hops and ordina|ries proceed to acts of cruelty, equally contrary to his judgment and inclination. He had been formerly &s;u&s;pected of favouring Luther's doctrines; and Paul IV. the pre&s;ent Pope, was his enemy. Thus obliged to be very cautious in his conduct, and to regulate it &s;o as not to be liable to any ju&s;t exception, he had, in his articles of vi&s;itation, in&s;erted &s;ome, directing the cler|gy to inquire after ab&s;entees from the church, and teachers of erroneous doctrines; and thought fit now to proceed again&s;t the dead, whom he could not hurt, to commute for his not exerci&s;ing &s;everity upon the living Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 124 of this volume.</NOTE>, the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;or of divinity, and the latter Hebrew lecturer,

Pole &s;ent down com|mi&s;&s;ioners to proceed with the &s;hew of an extraordinary rigour again&s;t their dead bodies; and, on January 10, tho&s;e two churches were interdicted. Their bodies being then taken out of the grave, they were cited to appear, or any body el&s;e in their behalf, that would dare to undertake their defence; witne&s;&s;es were ex|amined to prove their heterodoxy; and, after a deal of formality, pre&s;cribed by the canon law in &s;uch ca&s;es, the &s;entence was given, that the bodies &s;hould be car|ried, under a guard of armed men, to the market|place, and, being there chained to &s;everal &s;takes, &s;hould be burnt, together with as many of their books as could be procured. Pole had been cho&s;en Chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Oxford; and a like commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued for proceeding in the &s;ame manner again&s;t the corp&s;e of Peter Martyr's wife<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See pages 124, 132, 177, 193, of this volume.</NOTE>, who had been buried there, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the &s;ame reli|gion with her hu&s;band. But when the commi&s;&s;ioners came to execute their powers, they could find no wit|ne&s;s again&s;t her in this point; all that were examined profe&s;&s;ing that they did not under&s;tand her language, and therefore could not tell of what religion &s;he was: nor had &s;he read any books, as the Cambridge profe&s;|&s;ors had, to &s;upply the want of other legal evidence. This the commi&s;&s;ioners certified to the Cardinal; and orders were &s;ent to Dr. Mar&s;hall, Dean of Chri&s;t church, to take her body, and bury it in a common dunghill, &s;he having been a nun, and broken her vow of celi|bacy. It was about two years afterwards, upon Queen Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion, removed thence, and decently interred in the grave of St. Fride&s;wide; their bones being &s;o intermingled together, that there was no dan|ger, whatever change &s;hould happen, of its being ever
<PB N="241" REF="258">treated again in the like un&s;eemly manner. The a&s;hes of Bucer and Fagius were al&s;o interred at Cambridge about the &s;ame time; a &s;olemn commemoration of them being held there, their panegyric made by the univer&s;ity orator, and a &s;ermon preached by Mr. Pil|kington (afterwards Bi&s;hop of Durham) on the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mary, re&s;trained by no &s;aith of treaties, nor &s;eruple of con&s;cience,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip comes a|gain to England.</NOTE> from breaking the peace with France, was for going to war im|mediately; and her council, &s;eeing her rage or pa&s;&s;ion for her hu&s;band would not &s;uffer her to hearken to more moderate advice, were willing to give their con&s;ent for a&s;&s;i&s;ting, Philip with 6000 foot, and 600 hor&s;e, for the defence of the Low Countries, according to the treaty with the late Emperor; but were ab&s;olutely again&s;t a war, till the affairs of the realm were better &s;ettled. She re&s;olved to give him all the &s;uccour in her power; though &s;ick of vexation at the delay of his coming over, which had occa&s;ioned her a va&s;t expence in keeping a fleet ready for convoying him to England. At la&s;t he &s;ignified to her plainly, "that he &s;hould defer his coming till &s;he had declared war again&s;t France; that his honour lay at &s;take, and he could not come, unle&s;s a&s;&s;ured of a good reception, and being obeyed as King, particularly in what related to the &s;uccours he might rea&s;onably expect from Eng|land; that all his dominions were likely to be inva|ded; and, if he &s;hould come over, and not &s;ucceed in that point, but be forced to return without doing any thing, it would give a terrible blow to his repu|tation, and be of infinite di&s;&s;ervice to his affairs." Mary renewed her in&s;tances for his coming: a&s;&s;uring him, his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary to procure what he de&s;ired. She prevailed: and Philip arriving, on Sa|turday, March 20, at Greenwich, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung; and Mary met him at the church of the Cordeliers, or

The Engli&s;h gentlemen &s;lighted the proclamation, laughing at it publickly; and in fact, after the coming of the Spaniards, and trying their mettle in a few rencounters, they generally wore longer &s;$ords than they had u&s;ed bef re.&mdash;There had been fre|quent bickerings between the Engli&s;h and Spaniards, when Philip was formerly in England. One of the mo&s;t remarkable was at King&s;$on in Surry, on Corpus Chri&s;ti day, June 22, 1555, when a Spaniard, on &s;ome affront, killing an Engli&s;hman, the whole town ro&s;e, with &s;words and clubs, to knock all the Spaniards on the head without di&s;&s;i$ction, even in the church, where they took re|fuge: and the tumult was not appea&s;ed, until the murderer was hanged.</NOTE>. Cardinal Pole had quitted Greenwich in ha&s;te upon Philip's arrival, con&s;idering him as an enemy to the Pope, who&s;e legate he was: and propo&s;ed to re|tire into his dioce&s;e. Mary had a&s;&s;ured the King, that he &s;hould, at his arrival, find all the great Lords gained to his mind; depending upon the force of money to produce this effect. Henry Nevil, Earl of We&s;t more-land, had not been at court &s;ince her coronation: but now he was &s;ent for, with Francis Talbot and Edward Stanley, the Earls of Shrew&s;bury and Derby; though none of them were di&s;po&s;ed to enter into the mea&s;ures which her pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pired. Almo&s;t every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="243" REF="260">for a war was &s;till to be provided; the Queen and the Spaniards were hated; di&s;content reigned over every part of the nation, and nothing but the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France was wanting for the execution of the de|&s;igns of tho&s;e that propo&s;ed to overturn her govern|ment: yet &s;he re&s;olved rather to ruin her&s;elf, than not gratify her hu&s;band. She teazed her council every day on the &s;ubject: and on Thur&s;day, April 1, after making a formal harangue to the Lords, in&s;i&s;ted on their coming to a re&s;olution. They debated the mat|ter for two days; and, on Saturday, told her, "That they neither could, nor ought to, enter into a war; that France had been a good neighbour, had not aided her &s;ubjects in their rebellion, and had &s;aithfully ob|&s;erved her treaties; that all the wars with that country had been ruinous to England, and the la&s;t more &s;o than the precedent; that the nece&s;&s;ities of the realm, ari&s;ing from a general famine this year, fal&s;e coin, the impoveri&s;hment of the people, and the divi&s;ions about religion, were too great to render a war advi&s;eable, and it was expre&s;sly contrary to the conventions for her marriage." The Queen replied in a great rage, that this an&s;wer was not agreeable either to their own duty, or to her de&s;ire: and, allowing them two days more for their con&s;ultation, ordered them to bring her one, more to her own and her hu&s;band's &s;atisfaction. The be&s;t part of the council &s;till &s;tood out again&s;t all her menaces: though, after a week's di&s;pute with her, &s;ome of the Lords of the council were inclined to com|pound the matter, and, if a war was deferred till har|ve&s;t, that the nation might not be &s;tarved for want of provi&s;ions, to come into it at Michaelmas. This was not agreeable to the views of Philip, who re&s;olved not to vi&s;it England any more, unle&s;s he obtained an immediate declaration of war again&s;t France, and &s;hould effect a marriage between the Prince&s;s Eliza|beth, and Emanuel Phi$bert Duke of Savoy, his
<PB N="244" REF="261">general, &s;tiled <HI>Iron head</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip, to whom Elizabeth not only owed her liberty, but al&s;o, in a great mea&s;ure, her life, had more than once propo&s;ed this match; but without &s;ucce&s;s. However, as the Prince&s;s was under &s;uch ob|ligations to his good offices, he renewed, on this vi&s;it, his endeavours to accompli&s;h the propo&s;ed marriage. He had brought over Marga|ret Duche&s;s of Parma, his natural &s;i&s;ter, and his cou&s;in-german Chri&s;tina, daughter of Chri&s;tian II. the expelled King of Sweden and Denmark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page <HI>385</HI> of vol. <HI>ii.</HI> of this work.</NOTE>, and widow of Francis Duke of Lorrain, to carry Elizabeth with them to Flanders. Philip was in love with the Duche&s;s of Lorrain; and the little parties of &s;hooting which they had fre|quently together, as well as the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of her retinues, and the great profu&s;ion of her table, which &s;he was not able of her&s;elf to &s;upport, arou&s;ed Mary's jealou&s;y, and gave her a va&s;t deal of in|quietude. Whether it was on account of her being out of humour on this occa&s;ion, or becau&s;e a Swedi&s;h amba&s;&s;ador arrived, about Lady-day, with propo&s;als of marriage from his ma&s;ter, Philip's &s;ch me was not reli&s;hed; though the Prince&s;s, having a&s;ked leave to go to her hou&s;e in Norfolk, to be more out of the way, was refu&s;ed that indulgence till after Whit&s;untide. Francis de Noailles, Bi&s;hop of Dux, who had &s;ucceeded his brother Anthony in his emba&s;&s;y to the Engli&s;h court, had informed Elizabeth of Philip's de&s;igns; and &s;he declared, that &s;he would rather die than go to Flanders, or marry the Duke of Savoy. The Queen was &s;o aver&s;a to the propo&s;al, that &s;he would neither &s;end for her &s;i&s;ter from Hatfield in Hertford&s;hire, where &s;he re&s;ided under a guard, nor &s;uffer the two Duche&s;&s;es to vi&s;it her there. Every moment of the&s;e ladies &s;tay in England gave Mary grea$ unea&s;ine&s;s, which was in &s;ome mea&s;ure removed by the Duche&s;s of Parma's deoa$$ure on April 29, and the Duche&s;s of Lor|r$$'s on the 8th of the nexth month.</NOTE>. John de Luna, governor of the ca&s;tle of Milan, had a little before quitted the Spani&s;h &s;ervice; and retired into France. He had there informed the con&s;table De Montmorency, that, being very intimate with Pichon, one of the King of Spain's principal mini&s;ters, and talking with him about the mea&s;ures to be taken for making their ma&s;ter ab|&s;olute Lord of England, Pichon had told him, it had been already re&s;olved, that, after the King went thither, it &s;hould be propo&s;ed to the Engli&s;h to make war upon Scotland with a great army: and under this colour, a good body of Spaniards being brought over, with the le&s;s &s;u&s;picion, might be put into the &s;ea-ports and
<PB N="245" REF="262">fortre&s;&s;es of the greate&s;t importance. When Philip was once ma&s;ter of the&s;e, it would be no difficult matter for him, in conjunction with his venal creatures among the Engli&s;h, to reduce the re&s;t of the kingdom: and Pichon was of opinion, that Ruy de Sylva, Philip's chief confident, would land in England, with the very troops he was at this time bringing from Spain. There was a very great probability in this &s;cheme: and, though the Spaniards did not &s;eem to be as yet in a condition to put it in execution, the con&s;table thought fit to &s;end advice of it to M. de Noailles; who commu|nicating it to &s;uch as he thought proper, and knew to dete&s;t the Spani&s;h government, rendered them &s;till more aver&s;e to Philip's mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Mary, calling the council together, on April 8, declared publickly, that, if they did not agree to her mea&s;ures, &s;he &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s two-thirds of them; and Philip, if he did not carry his point, re&s;olved to de|part for Spain. The council, &s;till unwilling to com|ply, offered twice the number of men, and double the &s;ums of money, &s;tipulated in the treaties with the Low Countries, that they might not enter into an open war: but Philip &s;aid, "He had rather all the world &s;hould know they were embarked in his fortune, than have all the wealth in the nation." At la&s;t, an expre&s;s from the Earl of We&s;tmoreland broke the re&s;olution, in which the council had hitherto per&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mary's &s;u&s;picions had, from the beginning of the reign,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Stafford's at|tempt on Sear|borough.</NOTE> fallen heavily upon the military gentlemen; and as they were deemed the mo&s;t dangerous in ca&s;e of any in&s;urrec|tion, arre&s;ted their per&s;ons on different pretences, keeping them for years together in loath|&s;ome pri&s;ons, and confi&s;cating their e&s;tates. Divers of that character, to avoid per&s;ecution, had taken re|fuge in France, where, being &s;tripped of their fortunes, they made a &s;orry &s;hift to &s;ub&s;i&s;t: and finding all ap|plication to that court for aid un&s;ucce&s;sful, were by
<PB N="246" REF="263">their nece&s;&s;ities fit for any undertaking that could afford the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of relief. The Lord Paget, judging it not impracticable to animate &s;ome of tho&s;e refugees to an enterpri&s;e, which, being laid in France, would give a tolerable colour for a rupture with that crown, had, by the help of Dr. Wotton, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, found out one Captain Thomas Stafford fit for their purpo&s;e: and they wrought upon him by their agents &s;o effectually, that he undertook to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle of Scarborough, a place of con&s;e|quence and reputation, lying on the &s;ea, in the North-Riding of York&s;hire, but garri&s;oned &s;o weakly, and guarded, in appearance, with &s;o little ca&s;e, that the enterpri&s;e &s;eemed very fea&s;ible. Stafford, getting &s;ome &s;hips at Dieppe, and accompanied by thirty-four re|fugees, landed at Scarborough; where the Earl of We&s;tmoreland having intelligence of his &s;trength and motions from Doctor Wotton, was ready to receive him: and being &s;urrounded, upon his landing, be|tween the ca&s;tle and the &s;ea, was obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Stafford, with five or &s;ix others, were brought up to London: but the re&s;t were all hanged in the country, denying unanimou&s;ly they had any foreign &s;uccour or encouragement. Stafford owned at his trial, that he had got his de&s;ign communicated to the King of France and the con&s;table Montmorency; but he had never &s;een either: and, upon their both rejecting it, he had, in de&s;pair, attempted it with the few men he could get together. He was con|demned, and, on May 28, beheaded on Tower hill: and three of his accomplices were, the next day, hanged at Tyburn, only two of the thirty-five being pardoned. At his execution he declared, that he meant the liberty of his country, and died with great re&s;olution: but no remon&s;trances could prevail with him to a&s;k the King's and Queen's pardon, or to ac|knowledge that he had given them any offence. This &s;o enraged the Queen, that, &s;ending the next day to
<PB N="247" REF="264">the Tower, &s;he cau&s;ed his corp&s;e, which had been bu|ried in the chapel, to be dog up, drawn to Tower-hill, and there cut into quarters, and his bowels to be burnt; the populace laughing all the time at the ridiculous vengeance. beholding it as a madne&s;s and cruelty worthy of &s;uch a Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>The Scarborough affair had the inten 'ed effect: and the council,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip involves England in a war with France.</NOTE> re&s;olving upon an open war, thought fit to a&s;&s;ign it as the chief cau&s;e of their re&s;olution. Great preparations had been made for it: and, to defray the expences, the Queen had rai&s;ed 150,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> by levying the &s;econd year's &s;ub&s;idy before the time &s;ettled by parliament, which became a new &s;ubject of complaint: and either mortgaged the de|me&s;nes, or &s;old the lands, of the crown, to all that would purcha&s;e them; making no di&s;tinction between the old e&s;tates of the crown, and the new ones lately ve&s;ted in it by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries, which though, in her fits of con&s;cience, &s;he had made a &s;o|lemn promi&s;e of returning them to the church, were now &s;old for her hu&s;band's u&s;e, and to propagate a war in chri&s;tendom.&mdash;According to the ancient cu&s;tom, a herald was &s;ent over, to denounce war again&s;t the King of France. Henry II. accepting the defiance, forbade the herald to &s;ay more, "&s;ince he came from a woman, of whom it was not decent for a Prince of honour, virtue, and genero&s;ity, to take the revenge in words; though, in the ca&s;e of another per&s;on, he &s;hould have u&s;ed and fi$rent language: but &s;till hoped, God would &s;hew the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e by the event; prote&s;ting that &s;he was the author of all the evils, which the war &s;hould bring upon chri&s;tendom."</P>
<P>A war being thus entered into with France, to pre|vent any di&s;turbance at home, &s;everal gendemen, who had the misfortune to be &s;u&s;pected, were taken up and carried to the Tower, hoodwinked and muffled, that they might not be known, according to the Spani&s;h
<PB N="248" REF="265">fa&s;hion: others were taken into the &s;ervice, and even Sir Peter Carew, who had been long per&s;ecuted, was offered the command of 500 men; which he declined, though, to avoid the charge of di&s;affection, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ready to &s;erve as a volunteer. The city of London was ordered to rai&s;e 1000 men, well provided with arms and ammunition; the &s;oldiers that were pre&s;&s;ed going abroad with an ill will: and troops were daily tran&s;ported to Calais, where an army of 1000 hor&s;e, 5000 foot, and 2000 pioneers, rendez|vou&s;ed under the Earl of Pembroke. Philip arrived there, on July 5, in his way to Bru&s;&s;els; having been accompanied to Dover by the Queen; who, after the departure of her troops, rai&s;ed an extraordinary guard for the &s;afety of her per&s;on.</P>
<P>The action at St. Quintin, commonly called the battle of St Laurence,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Battle of St. Quintin.</NOTE> as happen|ing on Augu&s;t 10, where the French were entirely routed with a very great lo&s;s of men, and a num|ber of their chief nobility either &s;lain or taken pri&s;oners, was a terrible blow to France, and threw the whole kingdom, as well as Paris, into the utmo&s;t con&s;terna|tion; from which however they had time to recover, by Coligni's de&s;perate defence of St. Quintin for &s;eventeen days, which the Spaniards expected, as being untenable, would have immediately &s;urrendered after the victory obtained there: and Philip gained no very con&s;iderable advantages from his victory, on the &s;ide of Flanders, though it procured him great advantages in Italy; the King of France being obliged to recal part of his army employed there.</P>
<P>The Pope, re&s;enting greatly the Queen of England's engaging for her hu&s;band's &s;ake in the war again&s;t France, had deprived Cardinal Pole of his legatine powers; and, under pretence of calling the Cardinals about him, cited him to appear at Rome. It was nece&s;&s;ary to have a legate in England that under&s;tood the language, cu&s;toms, and manners, of the country:
<PB N="249" REF="266">and, few offering them&s;elves with the&s;e qualifications to his choice, he rai&s;ed Peter Peyto, a Franci&s;can Frier, of an ancient Engli&s;h family, and the Queen's confe&s;&s;or, June 14, to the dignities of Cardinal and Legate. The Queen re&s;olved not to admit the new Legate: but Pole, having advice of what pa&s;&s;ed, laid a&s;ide the marks of his legatine authority, and ab&s;tained from the exerci&s;e of his faculties. The victory of St. Quin|tin, and the recal of the French forces from Italy, obliging the Pope to think of an accommodation with Philip, a peace was made in September: and Paul, growing le&s;s eager in the pro&s;ecution of Pole, waved in&s;i&s;ting upon his repair to Rome, and at la&s;t re&s;tored him to his former legation. The Pope had, in his wrath, thrown out &s;peeches, detracting from the or|thodoxy of Pole's religious &s;entiments: and this per|haps made his Eminence, not only grant a commi&s;&s;ion for proceeding again&s;t the reformed in his dioce&s;e of Canterbury, but to &s;ignify al&s;o to the Queen, and to deliver to the &s;ecular arm, &s;uch as had been con|victed.</P>

Being weakly garri&s;oned, they were ea&s;ily reduced: and the Duke of Gui&s;e erecting, on January 4, a battery of fifteen pieces of cannon again&s;t the ca&s;tle, a large breach was &s;oon made in the walls:

But D'Andelot, Colonel-General of the French infantry, in the beginning of the night, running a trench to the &s;ide of the ditch, made a lodgment there, with 1200 fu&s;ileers; and u&s;ed &s;uch diligence to drain the water, that it was pa&s;&s;able in the morning at ebb, and the ca&s;tle was taken by a&s;&s;ault. The Lord Went-worth, Governor or the place, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of any &s;uccour, and having only 300 &s;ound men left of his garri&s;on, &s;urrendered it, on January 8, upon con|dition, that the town&s;men and &s;oldiers, leaving their effects to the mercy of the conquerors, might retire, the fir&s;t to what place they plea&s;ed, and the latter (ex|cept him&s;elf and fifty more, who were to be treated as pri&s;oners) to England. The Duke of Gui&s;e, follow|ing his blow, marched to Gui&s;nes, which he battered &s;o furiou&s;ly with thirty-five large cannon, that he &s;oon made three breaches: and the noi&s;e of the artillery was heard as far as Antwerp. The Lord Grey was in the place with a garri&s;on of 1100 men, and, on January 20, &s;tood a general a&s;&s;ault, in which he lo&s;t 4 or 500 of his &s;oldiers: and, retiring with the re&s;t into an old ca&s;tle, &s;urrendered it on the 22d, him&s;elf and the re&s;t of the principal officers remaining pri&s;oners of war, and the others having liberty to march off whither they plea&s;ed. The garri&s;on of Hammes quitted the place upon the approach the French army. Thus was Eng|land deprived, in le&s;s than a month, of conque&s;ts, which the Engli&s;h had retained for more than 200 years; France thinking the attempt all that time im|practicable: and lo&s;t the la&s;t foot of ground of what &s;he had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the continent. The lo&s;s of Calais &s;o affected Queen Mary, that &s;he &s;aid it would be found engraved on her heart after her decea&s;e.</P>
<P>This di&s;a&s;ter greatly dimini&s;hed the reputation of the

The coun|cil in their an&s;wer, on February 1, repre|&s;ented "their inability of accepting the offer, &s;ince the enterpri&s;e would require an army of 20,000 men, the charge whereof, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, they could not expect to rai&s;e a &s;um &s;ufficient to defray upon the uncertain hopes of &s;ucce&s;s." However, to provide for a defence of the realm, again&s;t the French and Scotch, the parliament meeting on Thur&s;|day, January 20, the convocation gave a &s;ub&s;idy of eight &s;hillings in the pound, payable in four years, by equal portions: and the Commons, be&s;ides a &s;ub&s;idy of four &s;hillings per pound on land, and two &s;hillings and eight-pence on goods, for one year, granted a fif|teenth. An act pa&s;&s;ed for "confirming all the &s;ales and grants of the crown-lands, either already made by the Queen, or that &s;hould be made by her for &s;even years to come;" a &s;ufficient time for alienating, and finding per&s;ons to purcha&s;e, the re&s;t of her deme&s;nes. On this occa&s;ion, one Mr. Copley, a member of the hou&s;e of Commons, expre&s;&s;ing his "fears that the Queen might thereby give away the crown from the right inheri|tors," was ordered to withdraw till the hou&s;e had con&s;idered of his words; and the&s;e being deemed <HI>irre|verent</HI> to her Maje&s;ty, he was called in; and begging pardon for his offence, if it was one, de&s;ired it might be imputed to his youth and inexperience. He was committed to the cu&s;tody of the Serjeant at Arms, till the Speaker had acquainted her Maje&s;ty with his of|fence, and interceded in the name of the hou&s;e for his pardon: and the Queen, after in&s;i&s;ting upon his being examined <HI>whence what he had &s;aid had &s;prung</HI> (which probably was from the general jealou&s;y, entertained all over the nation, of a de&s;ign to &s;et Philip on the throne after her decea&s;e, and to di&s;inherit the Prince&s;s

This report was made on Monday, March 7; but nothing further appears to have been done in this matter: the parliament, after pa&s;&s;ing two acts for the defence of the realm, &s;ettling the proportion of hor&s;es, armour, and weapons, which every man was to be provided with in their re&s;pective &s;tations, and making a provi&s;ion for the due taking of mu&s;ters, being prorogued that afternoon to Novem|ber 5, next following.</P>
<P>The&s;e precautions were not unnece&s;&s;ary; for upon the fir&s;t breaking out of the war, the King of France had &s;ent to the Queen Regent of Scotland, de&s;iring her to rai&s;e all its force, and make an irruption into Eng|land. She was &s;ufficiently inclined to comply with his de&s;ires: but there were &s;ome difficulties in the way; the gentry having been lately alarmed by an attempt for &s;ubjecting them to a &s;tanding tax, for the pay of a &s;tanding army of mercenaries, to be kept ready on all emergencies for the defence of the realm, which they were obliged to in their own per&s;ons by their tenures; and the people in general complaining that the great offices of &s;tate, and the places of the greate&s;t tru&s;t and profit, were put into the hands of Frenchmen. The project of the tax was coloured by the convenience which gentlemen would find in &s;taying at home, with|out neglecting their affairs, and expo&s;ing their per&s;ons in a time of war: but the Scotch, dreading the con&s;e|quences that a &s;tanding army might have, in making the re&s;t of the nation drop that warlike temper, which had been their &s;ure and glorious defence in all pa&s;t ages, and not caring to be expo&s;ed equally to attempts for en&s;laving them at home, and to the inva&s;ion of fo|reigners, without means in their hands to re&s;i&s;t both, &s;hewed &s;o much re&s;olution in oppo&s;ing it, that the &s;cheme was for a time laid a&s;ide.</P>

The Dauphin was to take the name and title of King of Scotland, to have his arms quartered with tho&s;e of that kingdom; and when he came to be King of France, to bear the titles and arms of both realms under one crown. In ca&s;e of i&s;&s;ue by the marriage, the elde&s;t &s;on was to inherit both crowns; but if only females &s;prung from it, the elde&s;t daughter was to be Queen of Scotland, and have, as a daughter of France, 400,000, and each of the younge&s;t daughters 300,000 crowns for their portion. The ceremony of the affiancing having been performed &s;ometime before, Francis and Mary were &s;olemnly wedded on Sunday, April 24: and four days after, all the Scotti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners (except the Bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, who did not come to France with the re&s;t) &s;wore allegiance in the name of the e&s;tates of Scotland, to the Queen, and to
<PB N="254" REF="273">the King Dauphin, on account of his being her con&s;ort.</P>
<P>The French at that time had views of en&s;laving Scot|land, which they were a&s;hamed or afraid of owning; but which appear evidently in three in&s;truments, that the young Queen was made to &s;ign privately on April 4, twenty days before the &s;olemnization of her mar|riage. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e, "&s;he conveyed after her death, without i&s;&s;ue, to the King of France and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and made them a donation <HI>cau&s;a mortis</HI> of the kingdom of Scotland and its appurtenances, with all the rights that &s;he either had at pre&s;ent, or might hereafter have, to the kingdom of England, and all the lands and cominions thereto belonging." The &s;e|cond &s;eems to have been a kind of mortgage, "giving the King of France, after her decea&s;e without children, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the realm of Scotland, till he &s;hould be reimbur&s;ed a million of pieces of gold, or &s;uch greater &s;um as &s;hould appear due to him, as well for her edu|cation and entertainment in France, as for his expences in th$ defence of Scotland again&s;t the power of Eng|land." In the third writing, of the &s;ame date with the two former, and confirming them both, &s;he declares, "that finding the deputies of the e&s;tates of Scotland were, out of favour to certain per&s;ons, obliged by their in&s;tructions to in&s;i&s;t on the kingdom's de&s;cending, for want of heirs of her body, to &s;ome Lords of the coun|try, taking thereby from her, the true Queen, all liber|ty and power to di&s;po&s;e thereof; and not daring, for certain rea&s;ons and ju&s;t fears, to contradict &s;uch their re&s;olution at pre&s;ent, being at a di&s;tance from her realm and the &s;ight of her &s;ubjects, not a&s;&s;ured of the &s;orts and &s;trong holds of the country; and her open oppo&s;ition to it being likely to produce great troubles and com|bu&s;tions to the ruin of her realm, e&s;pecially whil&s;t a war was carrying on between France and England, &s;he there|fore prote&s;ts, that, whatever con&s;ent &s;he &s;hould give to the articles and in&s;tructions &s;ent by the e&s;tates of her

<P>As Mary was of too tender an age to judge for her|&s;elf, it was impious and cruel to entangle her in &s;uch acts of prevarication, and breach of faith; which, if known, mu&s;t render her odious to her own &s;ubjects. Here at lea&s;t was laid the foundation of that claim of the crown of England, which, being &s;oon followed by &s;ome other acts of a like meaning, into which &s;he was drawn by the council of France, the authority of her hu&s;band (whom &s;he wedded on April 24) and the advice of her ambitious uncles, proved the chief cau&s;e of all her troubles, and the violent death &s;he at la&s;t &s;uffered.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions at Paris, the council of England re&s;olved to fit out a large fleet, with a con|&s;iderable land-force on board, in order to make de|&s;cents on the coa&s;ts of France, and particularly to &s;eize Bre&s;t in Brittany, hoping perhaps it might, in a treaty of peace, &s;erve as an equivalent for Calais. But they were &s;o &s;low in their preparations, and &s;o lit|tle careful to keep the &s;ecret, that the fleet did not &s;ail till the latter end of July: and, in the mean time, the French had di&s;covered their de&s;ign. They found Bre&s;t too well fortified and guarded to make any attempt upon the place; and &s;ailing to Conquet, plundered and burnt the town, with the mona&s;tery of St. Mah&eacute;, and &s;ome adjoining villages: but the Flemi&s;h forces, marching further up into the country, were attacked in the height of their pillaging, by M. de Ker&s;imon, a Breton nobleman, at the head of 6000 militia troops, and defeated with the lo&s;s of 500 of their number. Ten Engli&s;h &s;hips, commanded by Vice Admiral Malin,
<PB N="256" REF="275">did, on July 13, a much greater &s;ervice,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Battle of Gravelines.</NOTE> in the battle between the Mare&s;chel de Fer|mes, Governor of Calais, and the Count of Egmond, Governor of Flanders, near Gravelines. The victory was doubtful, when the&s;e &s;hips, pa&s;&s;ing accidentally off the coa&s;t, and drawn by the noi&s;e of the firing to the place of the engagement, came up the river, by the advantage of an high tide: and, ly|ing in the middle of it, played with their cannon $o terribly upon the French troops, that they were routed with the lo&s;s of 5000 men. As the French army, thus ruined, had been drawn out of Calais, and other neighbouring garri&s;ons, a fair opportunity now offered for the recovery of that place, in which the fleet and forces that plundered Conquet might have been very u&s;eful, and were ready for the &s;ervice: but the coun|cil had no vigour, and Philip was indifferent for every thing that regarded the intere&s;t of England.</P>
<P>The Queen of England had never been perfectly well &s;ince her &s;uppo&s;ed pregnancy: and, though the lump of fle&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Ma|ry's death,</NOTE> which contributed to that mi&s;take, had been taken away, a foundation was laid for a drop&s;y. This was neglected at fir&s;t, &s;he being &s;o de&s;irous of appearing to be in health (which &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep her di&s;af|fected &s;ubjects in awe) that &s;he would con&s;ult nobody but a young phy&s;ician, much in her confidence, but of little judgement or experience: and the di&s;ea&s;e gather|ed &s;trength by degrees. She had expected her hu&s;band over in May with &s;o much a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he had &s;ent his hor&s;es and wardrobe to wait on him at Harwich and Dover, and the Lord Admiral Clinton to the latter of the&s;e places, to prepare and command the fleet de&s;tined for his convoy: but, after every thing was in readine&s;s for his pa&s;&s;age and reception, &s;he found, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible grief, that his voyage was not only &s;topped by the pre&s;&s;ure of his affairs, but that, as &s;oon as the&s;e were &s;ettled, he had, re&s;olved to
<PB N="257" REF="276">embark for Spain. This neglect &s;truck her to the heart: and being accompan$ed with other &s;ubjects of anxiety, the di&s;orders of government, the ill-&s;ucce&s;s of all her enterpri&s;es, the hatred of her people, the continual dangers of in&s;urrections and inva&s;ions, the emptine&s;s of her exchequer, the di&s;tre&s;s of the realm and of all her affairs, the lo&s;s of Calais, to the great di&s;honour and ruin of her credit abroad, produced a poorne&s;s of blood, a dejection of &s;pirits, and a &s;low, yet vi&s;ible decay. The impetuo&s;ity of her pa&s;&s;ions, added to the ordinary effects of a continual unea&s;ine&s;s, the inveteracy of her con&s;tant di&s;temper, and the mo&s;t unhealthy autumn that perhaps ever was known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At that time there raged a pe&s;tilential fever and quartan ague, which &s;eized tho&s;e chiefly who were advanced in years, and cut off greater numbers than any former plague is &s;aid to have done. Divers places were left void of ju&s;tices, and men of worth, to govern the kingdom; and the mortality among the clergy was &s;o great, that thirteen Bi&s;hops died, many pari&s;hes had no divine &s;ervice, and curates could not be got for money. Much corn was left on the field for want of labourers to get it in. The contagion proved &s;atal al&s;o to phy&s;icians, and two belonging to the Queen died a little before her demi&s;e.</NOTE>, threw her into a lingering &s;ever, which wore her away &s;o vi&s;ibly, that all about her per&s;on thought her life in great danger. In this condition &s;he thought of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or; and hating her &s;i&s;ter, would have excluded her, had it been practicable. Philip and a Spani&s;h govern|ment were too odious to the nation, and too much the aver&s;ion of her own council, to have any room for hopes, that a di&s;po&s;ition in his favour could take place but by mere force, which could not be u&s;ed in the pre&s;ent juncture. To bequeathe the crown to the Queen Dauphine&s;s Mary of Scotland, was to perpetuate a war between Chri&s;tian powers, when on the point of being terminated; to aggrandize his and her mortal enemy; and to do an infinite prejudice to the affairs of an hu&s;band, whom, in de&s;pight of his ingratitude, &s;he loved to di&s;traction. Cardinal Pole was de&s;cended of
<PB N="258" REF="277">the royal family, much in her graces, and likely to be &s;upported by all the Popi&s;h intere&s;t: but he was timid in all his actions, his head full of &s;cruples, and, through a defect of ambition, courage, and vigour, unquali|fied to undertake or conduct an enterpri&s;e of &s;uch a nature, as the u&s;urpation of a crown, and the &s;ub|verting of the con&s;titution of a powerful kingdom. Be&s;ides, he was in &s;o very bad a &s;tate of health, that his life was in danger: and &s;he found, after all, that &s;he could not alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion without an act of parliament. There was one in being, and its &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion began on November 5; but there was little likelihood of its coming into any &s;uch mea&s;ures, when the Commons di&s;puted about granting a &s;ub&s;idy, which had been, on the 14th of that month, demanded of them in the Queen's name, and recommended by the Lords, and the nece&s;&s;ity whereof for the &s;afeguard of the realm was evident. In fact, none was voted be|fore its di&s;&s;olution by her death, on November 17, at St. James's, a little before day-light; Cardinal Pole expiring about &s;ixteen hours after her. Mary's de|mi&s;e was looked upon as a &s;ignal deliverance, as it happened on the eve of a peace; which would have enabled her and Philip to pur&s;ue their &s;cheme for &s;ub|verting the con&s;titution of the kingdom, and en&s;laving a di&s;united people, hopele&s;s of any foreign &s;uccours, and which had been long fixed for the time of its exe|cution.

During her reign, and perhaps by the encourage|ment of her example, two new colleges were added to the univer|&s;ity of Oxford.

<P>The character of Mary may be ea&s;ily deduced from her actions,<NOTE PLACE="inter">and character.</NOTE> as well pub|lic as private, before-mentioned. John White, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in his funeral panegy|ric upon her, celebrates her devotion, zeal for Popery, benefactions to the clergy, and re&s;ignation to the will of Heaven, when, weary of the world, &s;he lay upon her death-bed, and received the &s;acraments; this is the &s;um of what tho&s;e, who had ta&s;ted mo&s;t of her kind|ne&s;s, were able to &s;ay in her favour. Mary was not formed to plea&s;e; &s;he had nothing of the amiable wo|man either in her per&s;on or behaviour; was &s;tiff, for|mal, re&s;erved, four, haughty, and arrogant; her &s;ace plain and coar&s;e, without any &s;oft features to &s;mooth its roughne&s;s, or any in&s;inuating graces to &s;hade its de|fects: every thing in her looks, her air, her carriage, and manner, was forbidding She did not care, or did not know how to oblige: did all things in an im|perious and grating way, choo&s;ing to be feared rather than to be loved. She had been b$ed up to learning by her father: but it did not &s;erve either to improve her mind, to inform her judgment, or to remove her pre|judices. She pretended, or perhaps fancied her&s;elf, to have a great deal of religion; it was the point in which &s;he fixed her chief glory; and &s;he had really as much of it, as her inordinate pride or pa&s;&s;ions would give her leave to retain: but it was a religion of a low kind,
<PB N="260" REF="279">that of a bigot, and choaked with &s;uper&s;tition. Hence aro&s;e the incon&s;i&s;tency of her conduct, in re&s;uming the title of <HI>&s;upreme head of the church of England,</HI> after &s;he had laid it a&s;ide with a &s;eeming abhorrence; and in other re&s;pects, that delicacy and tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, which induced her to declare, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner, to her parliaments, and to all the world, that &s;he could not, with the &s;afety of her &s;oul, retain any church-goods in her hands, allowing her afterwards to &s;ell them, for &s;upplying her hu&s;band with the money, ari&s;ing from their &s;ale, to carry on a bloody war between Chri&s;tian potentates. She did not want under&s;tanding: but her violent pa&s;&s;ions were &s;uch a drawback upon it, that &s;he had a very &s;mall &s;tock of good &s;en&s;e left upon the ballance: and &s;he had &s;o little regard to her own dignity and decorum, as to admit of formal con&s;ulta|tions for burning the body of her father, and cutting off the head of her &s;i&s;ter. Her fundamental defects were the &s;ame with her father's, an unmea&s;urable pride, a &s;urious impetuo&s;ity, the effect of her violent pa&s;&s;ions; a wilfulne&s;s to which &s;he would have &s;acrificed the world; and an in&s;atiable avarice: &s;he equalled him at lea&s;t in all the&s;e re&s;pects, but wanted his judgment in the exerci&s;e of them, and, if po&s;&s;ible, outdid him in arbitrary cruelty. Henry made all his pa&s;&s;ions give way to his politics, to his own reputation, and to the intere&s;ts of the kingdom: Mary's conduct &s;hewed her to be equally regardle&s;s of her own honour, and the good of her people. Be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;hocking &s;cenes of cruelty, exhibited to the very end of her reign, in burning people for religion, her &s;u&s;picions reduced the nation to the &s;ame mi&s;erable condition it had experi|enced, under the per&s;ecutions of Emp&s;on and Dudley, in the reign of her grandfather. Scarce any body was fa&s;e from them: but they fell with the greate&s;t violence upon the worthie&s;t per&s;ons, producing fines, impri&s;on|ments, exiles, and confi&s;cation of e&s;tares.

<P>In the reign of King Edward, he was &s;ent for home by Bi&s;hop Ridley, and made a Prebendary of St. Paul's; and the Dean and chapter cho&s;e him to read a divinity|lecture in that church: In which place he continued till Queen Mary's days. In the beginning of her reign, in a &s;ermon at St. Paul's cro&s;s, he exhorted the people to adhere con&s;tantly to that doctrine which they had been taught, and to beware of Popery, Idolatry, and Super&s;tition; for which he was called before the Lords of the council, where he made an ingenuous and godly an&s;wer, but withal carried him&s;elf &s;o prudently, that for that time he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. But after the Queen's proclamation came forth, he was ag$in called, and committed pri&s;oner to his own hou&s;e, whence he
<PB N="262" REF="281">might have e&s;caped, and had many motives, as a wife and ten children, and friends in Germany where he could not want preferment. But being once called to an&s;wer in Chri&s;t's cau&s;e, he &s;aid, he would not depart, though to the hazard of his life. From his own hou&s;e Bonner removed him to Newgate, where he remained &s;ome time, among thieves and murderers.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he was again called before the Lords of the council, where Gardiner the Lord Chancellor taunted, reviled, and checked him not &s;uffering him to &s;peak his mind, and remanded him to pri&s;on; whereupon he wrote thus: "I was compelled to leave off what I would have gladly &s;poken, and therefore I de&s;ire the mo&s;t hearty and un&s;eigned prayers of all Chri&s;t's true members, the true imps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Imp &s;ignifies, in this ca&s;e, &s;on, offspring, or progeny.</NOTE> of the true Catholic church: that the Lord God of all con&s;olation will now be my comfort, &s;trength buckler, and &s;hield: as al&s;o of all my brethren who are in the &s;ame ca&s;e; that I, and you all, may de&s;pi&s;e all manner of threats, and cruelty, and even the bitter burning fire, and the dreadful dart of death, and &s;tick like true &s;oldiers to our dear and loving captain Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our only Redeemer and Saviour, and the only true head of the church: that we do not traiterou&s;ly run out of his tents, or rather out of the plain field from him in the heat of the bat|tle: but that we may per&s;evere in the fight (if he plea&s;e not otherwi&s;e to deliver us) till we be mo&s;t cruelly &s;lain by his enemies. For this I mo&s;t heartily, and even with tears, mo&s;t in&s;tantly and earne&s;tly de&s;ire you all to pray: and if I die, to be good to my poor and mo&s;t hone&s;t wife, being a poor &s;tranger, and to all my little &s;ouls, her and my children."</P>
<P>The day following he was brought before the coun|cil again, and al&s;o a third time, where he met with the like u&s;age; and, when by no means they could re|move him from his con&s;tancy, Gardiner read his &s;en|tence of condemnation, degraded him, and then de|livered him over to the &s;ecular power: declaring that
<PB N="263" REF="282">he was under the great cur&s;e, and that it was a dange|rous and vengeable matter to eat or drink with him, or to give him any thing; for that all who did &s;o &s;hould partake of the &s;ame cur&s;e. Then Mr. Rogers &s;aid: "Well, my Lord, here I &s;tand before God and you, and all this honourable audience, and take him to witne&s;s, that I never wittingly and willingly taught any fal&s;e doctrine; and therefore have I a good con|&s;cience before God and all good men. I am &s;ure that you and I &s;hall come before a righteous Judge, before whom I &s;hall be as good a man as you: and I nothing doubt, but I &s;hall be found a true member of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and everla&s;tingly &s;aved: and as for your fal&s;e church, you needed not to have excommunicated me out of it, for I have not lived in it the&s;e twenty years, the Lord be thanked for it." He then de&s;ired that his wife might be admitted to come to him whil&s;t he lived: but Gardiner would by no means grant his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>On February 4, 1555, he was wakened (being then &s;ound a&s;leep) by the Keeper of Newgate's wife, and told to prepare him&s;elf for the fire. Being de&s;ired to make ha&s;te, he &s;aid, "If it be &s;o, I need not tie my points<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By that he meant the $$tchets of his &s;hoes.</NOTE>;" and was immediately hurried away to Bon|ner, of whom he earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to &s;peak with his wife, but could not prevail. From thence he was carried into Smithfield, where, &s;carce being permitted to &s;peak to the people, he briefly per&s;uaded them to per&s;evere in the truth which he had taught them, and which he was now ready to &s;eal with his blood. A pardon being offered him, if he would recant, he ut|terly refu&s;ed it. His wife, with nine &s;mall children, and the tenth &s;ucking at her brea&s;t, came to him; but this &s;orrowful &s;ight had no effect on him, but in the flames he wa&s;hed his hands, and with an admirable pa|tience took his death, all the people exceedingly re|joicing at his con&s;tancy, and prai&s;ing God for it. He was the <HI>Proto-Martyr</HI> in Queen Mary's days.</P>
<PB N="264" REF="283">
<P>During the time of his impri&s;onment, &s;trict &s;earch was made in his chamber for his writings and papers, yet none were found: but, after his death, his wife and one of his &s;ons found, lying in a corner under a blind pair of &s;tairs, a book which contained a narra|tion of his examination, and an&s;wers, whereunto were added the&s;e as predictions: "If God look not mercifully upon England, the &s;eeds of utter de&s;truction are &s;own in it already by the&s;e hypocritical tyrants, and Anti|chri&s;tian Prelates, double traitors to their native coun|try. And yet they &s;peak of mercy, of ble&s;&s;ing, of unity, of the Catholic church, &amp;c. but this double di&s;&s;imulation will be di&s;covered one day when the plague comes, which undoubtedly will fall upon tho&s;e crown|&s;horn Captains, and that &s;hortly, what&s;oever the godly and the poor realm &s;uffer in the mean time by God's permi&s;&s;ion. For the di&s;per&s;ed Engli&s;h flock &s;hall be brought again into their former &s;tate, or a better (I tru&s;t in God) than it was in the innocent King Ed|ward's days; and our bloody Babylonian Bi&s;hops, with their whole crown-&s;horn company, &s;hall be brought to utter &s;hame, rebuke, ruin, and de&s;truction. For God cannot, and undoubtedly will not, &s;uffer for ever their abominable lying, fal&s;e doctrine, hypocri&s;y, blood th$$$ne&s;s, whoredoms, idlene&s;s, their pe&s;tilent lives, pampe$ed in all kinds of delights, their ton&s;o|nical boa&s;ting pride, their malicious, envious, and poi&s;onful &s;tomachs, which they bear towards his poor afflicted flock. Some &s;hall have their puni&s;hment in this world, and they that e&s;cape here, &s;hall not e&s;cape everla&s;ting damnation. This &s;hall be your &s;auce, O ye wicked Papi&s;ts, make ye merry as long as ye may."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he lay in the pri&s;on of Newgate, he was very merry, and earne&s;t in all he went about, being there above a year. To the pri&s;oners he was very charitable, and liberal; for their &s;akes he made an agreement with his fellows, that they &s;hould eat but one meal a day,
<PB N="265" REF="284">yet paying for two, which overplus &s;hould be given to them that lacked on the other &s;ide of the pri&s;on.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> LAURENCE SAUNDERS.</HEAD>
<P>LAURENCE SAUNDERS was born of wor&s;hipful pa|rents, educated at Eaton &s;chool, and from thence cho&s;en to King's college in Cambridge, where he re|mained three years, and greatly profited in learning. Then his mother (who was very rich) thought proper to bind him apprentice to a merchant in London, Sir William Che&s;ter.</P>
<P>His ma&s;ter, being a good man, ob&s;erving that his mind was better fitted for &s;piritual contemplation than the bu&s;tle of a bu&s;y life, and that his inclinations were wholly bent on the one, but aver&s;e to the other, ac|quainted his friends with it, gave him back his inden|tures, and relea&s;ed him from his engagement.</P>
<P>Saunders being ravi&s;hed with the love of learning, e&s;pecially with reading the &s;criptures, &s;oon after re|turned to Cambridge, where he &s;tudied Greek and Hebrew, but chiefly divinity, that he might qualify him&s;elf for a mini&s;terial life. He was frequent, and very fervent in prayer, and, when a&s;&s;aulted by tempta|tions, had always re&s;ource to that exerci&s;e, from which he derived much &s;upport and con&s;olation. He com|menced Ma&s;ter of Arts, and continued long in the univer&s;ity. In the beginning of King Edward's reign he began to preach (being fir&s;t ordained) and by his doctrine and exemplary life did a great deal of &s;ervice, and gained a general approbation, &s;o far that he was cho&s;en to read a divinity-lecture at Fotheringhay. Soon after he married, and removed from thence to the mini&s;try of Litchfield, where he gained, by his behaviour, even the good opinion of his adver&s;aries. From thence he was removed to Church Langton in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, where he taught diligently, and kept a bountiful hou&s;e, and from thence to All-hallows in
<PB N="266" REF="285">Bread &s;treet, London. But upon Mary's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, he wanted to re&s;ign his benefice in town, and took a journey into the country, and in his way preach|ed at N$tthampton, not meddling with &s;tate-affairs, but boldly delivering his opinions again&s;t the Popi&s;h tenets; which (&s;aid he) are likely to be renewed, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for the little love which England hath born to the true word of God, &s;o plentifully offered to them. Some of the Queen's men, which were there, and heard him, were highly di&s;plea&s;ed with his &s;ermon, and on that account confined him &s;ome time among them. But, in regard to his friends, who were great &s;ticklers for Mary, and becau&s;e there was no law broken by his preaching, at length they di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him. Not di&s;mayed at this, but inflamed with a godly zeal, he per&s;i&s;ted in preaching faithfully at both his benefices, not having opportunity to re&s;ign either of them, but into the hands of Papi&s;ts: and notwith&s;tanding the Queen's proclamation to the con|trary, he diligently taught his opinions, at his country place, where he then re&s;ided, confirming the people, and arming them again&s;t the Popi&s;h doctrine, till he was commanded and obliged to de&s;i&s;t. His friends advi&s;ed him to quit the kingdom, which he refu&s;ed; and being hindered there from preaching, he travelled towards London, to vi&s;it his flock there.</P>
<P>Sir John Mordaunt, one of the Queen's council, meeting him near London, and inquiring whither he went? <HI>I have</HI> (&s;aid Mr. Saunders) <HI>a pa&s;toral charge in London, whither I am going to in&s;truct my people according to the truth.</HI> Mordaunt advi&s;ed him again&s;t it: but Saunders a&s;ked him, <HI>How then &s;hall I be di&s;charged be|fore God; if any be &s;ick, and de&s;ire con&s;olation; or if any want good coun&s;el, and in&s;truction, or if any &s;hould &s;lip into error, and receive fal&s;e doctrine?</HI> Being a&s;ked if he did not preach at &s;uch a time in Bread-&s;treet, he re|plied in the affirmative. Do you intend to preach &s;o again, &s;aid Mordaunt? <HI>Yes,</HI> replied Saunders, <HI>to mor|row
<PB N="267" REF="286">you may hear me there, where I will confirm by God's word all that I then preached.</HI> Finding he could not prevail on him to de&s;i&s;t from his purpo&s;e, Mordaunt left him, and going &s;oon after to Bonner, informed him of Saunders's intention to preach the next day; which he accordingly did; and afterwards, at his lodging, being &s;omewhat troubled in his thoughts, a friend of his a&s;ked him how he did? <HI>Truly,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I am in pri&s;on, till I be in pri&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The text which he preached upon in the forenoon was 2 Cor. ii. 2. <HI>I am jealous over you with godly jea|lou&s;y, for I have e&s;pou&s;ed you to one hu&s;band, that I may pre&s;ent you as a cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t. But I fear le&s;t by any means, as the &s;erpent beguiled Eve through his &s;ub|tility, &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted from the &s;implicicy that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> In the afternoon, he was preparing him&s;elf to preach again, when an officer from Bonner came and took him before that prelate, with whom he found Mordaunt. He was charged with trea&s;on for acting contrary to the Queen's proclamation; and with here&s;y and &s;edition for his &s;ermon. Bonner &s;aid he would prove him to be a heretic, becau&s;e he taught that the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, and all orders of the church, were mo&s;t pure which came neare&s;t to the order of the primitive church: for (&s;aid Bonner) the church was then in her infancy, and could not bear that perfection which afterwards it ac|quired by ceremonies. Saunders an&s;wered from St. Augu&s;tine, "that ceremonies were given to the infirm and weak, and therefore it was a &s;ign of the great perfection of the primitive church, that it had few ceremonies; whereas the Roman church had many, and the&s;e partly bla&s;phemous, un&s;avory, and unpro|fitable." After &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e, the Bi&s;hop de|&s;ired him to write his judgment concerning tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, which he did, &s;aving, <HI>You &s;eek my blood, and you &s;hall have it: I pray God you may be &s;o bapti&s;ed in it, that you may hereafter loath blood-&s;ucking, and be|come
<PB N="268" REF="287">a better man.</HI> He was then &s;ent to Gardiner, who demanded of him how he had dared to preach, notwith&s;tanding the Queen's proclamation? Saunders replied, that he did but, according to his duty, ex|hort his flock to per&s;evere and &s;tand &s;tedfa&s;t in the doctrine they had been taught: repeating the words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>that it is better to obey God than man,</HI> and &s;aid, that what he did, he was moved thereto by his own con&s;cience. A goodly con&s;cience indeed, &s;aid Gardiner; this your con&s;cience could make the Queen a ba&s;tard; would it not? No, replied Saun|ders, we declare no &s;uch matter; but for that let them care who&s;e writings are yet abroad to te&s;tify the &s;ame, not without the &s;hame and reproach of the author. This he &s;aid, alluding to a book Gardiner had publi&s;hed, to curry favour with Henry VIII. wherein he had openly declared Queen Mary to be a ba&s;tard. No, &s;aid he, we only profe&s;s, and teach, the &s;incerity and purity of God's word; which, albeit it be now forbidden us to publi&s;h with our mouths, yet I doubt not but it will be &s;ealed with our blood.</P>
<P>Gardiner, irritated at the freedom of his &s;peech, ordered him to pri&s;on; on which Saunders &s;aid, <HI>I thank God for having at la&s;t given me a place of re&s;t, where I may pray for your conver&s;ion.</HI> He continued in pri&s;on one year and three months: and was &s;o zealous in defence of the truth, that he forbade his wife to &s;ue for his delivery: and, when other of his friends had by &s;uit almo&s;t obtained it, he &s;o di&s;coura|ged them that they gave over the pur&s;uit. Being brought again to examination, and life promi&s;ed him, if he would recant, he an&s;wered, <HI>I love my life and liberty, if I could enjoy them without the hurt of my own con&s;cience; but, by God's grace, I will bear the utmo&s;t that man can do again&s;t me, rather than do any thing again&s;t my own con&s;cience:</HI> And, when Gardiner threatened him with death, he &s;aid, <HI>Welcome be it, what&s;oever the will of the Lord be, either life or death; and I tell you
<PB N="269" REF="288">truly, I have learnt to die: but I exhort you to beware of &s;hedding innocent blood: truly it will cry aloud again&s;t you.</HI></P>
<P>Being excommunicated, degraded, and condemned, he was &s;ent to Coventry to be burned. When he came near the place of execution, on February 8, 1555, he went chearfully to the &s;take, ki&s;&s;ing it, and &s;aying, <HI>Welcome, the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t! Welcome, everla&s;ting life!</HI> The fire was made of green wood and other &s;mothering materials which would not burn, whereby he underwent grievous torments: but the grace, and plentiful con&s;olation of Chri&s;t, which never for&s;ake his &s;ervants, gave him admirable &s;trength and patience, &s;o that he died with great calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>During his impri&s;onment, he wrote many excellent letters; and after his condemnation, in a letter to his wife, and friends, he thus writes; "Oh what worthy thanks can be given to our gracious God, for his un|mea&s;urable mercies plentifully poured upon us! And I, mo&s;t unworthy wretch, cannot but bewail my great ingratitude, towards &s;o gracious a God and loving father. I be&s;eech you all, as for my other many &s;ins, &s;o e&s;pecially for my &s;in of unthankfulne&s;s, crave par|don for me in your earne&s;t prayers. To number God's mercies in particular, were to number the drops of water in the &s;ea, the &s;ands on the &s;hore, or the &s;tars in the heavens. O my dear wife and friends, rejoice with me, I &s;ay rejoice with thank&s;giving, for this my promotion, in that I am made worthy to magnify my God, not only in my life, by my &s;low mouth, and un|circumci&s;ed lips, bearing witne&s;s of his truth, but al&s;o by my blood to &s;eal the &s;ame, to the glory of my God, and confirming of his true church. I profe&s;s to you, that, as yet, the comfort of my &s;weet Chri&s;t doth drive from me the fear of death; but if my dear hu&s;band Chri&s;t do, for my trial, leave me a little to my&s;elf, alas I know in what ca&s;e I &s;hall then be: but if he do, yet I know that he will not be long, nor far ab&s;ent from me; though he &s;tand behind the wall, yet he will peep
<PB N="270" REF="289">in at a crevice. He is a tender-hearted Jo&s;eph, tho' he &s;peak roughly to his brethren, and threatened bond|age to his be&s;t beloved Benjamin, yet can he not con|tain him&s;elf from weeping upon us, and with us, from falling on our necks, and &s;weetly ki&s;&s;ing us. Such, &s;uch a brother is our Chri&s;t unto all his; wherefore ha&s;ten to go unto him, as Jacob did with his &s;ons and family, leaving their country and acquaintance. Yea this our Jo&s;eph hath obtained for us, that Pharoah the infidel &s;hall provide us chariots, whereby with ea&s;e we may be carried to him. Our very adver&s;aries do help us to our everla&s;ting bli&s;s, by their &s;peedy di&s;patch, ble&s;&s;ed be our God. Fear not bugbears which lie in the way; fear rather the everla&s;ting fire, &amp;c. My dear wife, and fellow heirs of the everla&s;ting kingdom, always remember the Lord; rejoice in hope, be pa|tient in tribulation, continue in&s;tant in prayer, and pray for us appointed for the &s;laughter, that we may be unto our heavenly Father a fat offering, and an ac|ceptable &s;acrifice. Farewel, all in Chri&s;t, in hope to be joined with you in everla&s;ting joy. Amen, Amen, Amen. Pray, Pray."</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. JOHN HOOPER.</HEAD>
<P>This divine was born in Somer&s;et&s;hire, A. D. 1495, and in 1514 &s;ent to Merton college in Oxford, where he was placed under the tuition of his uncle John Hooper, ma&s;ter fellow of that college, and principal of St. Alban's-hall. In 1518, John the nephew was admitted bachelor of arts, which was the highe&s;t degree he took in that univer&s;ity, and about the &s;ame time compleated it by determination. After this he is &s;aid to have been one of the Carmelites or White-friers, and to have continued &s;o for &s;ome years, till growing weary of a mona&s;tic life, he re|turned to Oxford; but having there embraced the
<PB N="271" REF="290">Prote&s;tant principles, when the act of the &s;ix articles came out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 11 of this volume.</NOTE>, he was compelled to quit the univer&s;ity. He then went to live in Devon&s;hire with Sir Thomas Arun|del, as his chaplain and &s;teward: till Sir Thomas having intelligence of his opinions, which were contrary to his own, yet having a great regard for his integrity, &s;ent him on a me&s;&s;age to Gardiner Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, writing privately to the prelate to endeavour to reclaim him, but in any ca&s;e requiring him to &s;end him his &s;ervant again.</P>
<P>Gardiner conferred with him &s;everal days; but finding him fixed in his opinions, &s;ent him back, according to Sir Thomas's de&s;ire, much commending his wit and learning, but ever after bore a &s;ecret grudge and antipathy again&s;t him: &s;o that, &s;oon after, Mr. Hooper was warned by &s;ome private friends to provide for his own &s;afety, for that there was &s;omething &s;ecretly forming again&s;t him. Upon this he le&s;t the kingdom, and went to Paris. After &s;ome time, he re|turned, and lived with a gentleman of the name of Sentlow: but under&s;tanding that &s;nares were again laid for him, with much difficulty and danger he e&s;caped a &s;econd time abroad, and travelled into Germany, where he became acquainted with many learned men, and by them was generou&s;ly entertained, both at Bazil and Zurich; e&s;pecially by Bullinger, who became his very intimate friend.</P>
<P>There he &s;tudied Hebrew, and married a wife; and at la&s;t, upon Edward VI.'s acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, he, with many other exiles, returned to London, where he generally preached twice, and at lea&s;t once every day. The people &s;o flocked to hear him, that the churches could not contain them. He was &s;oon ap|pointed chaplain to the Duke of Somer&s;et. In his doctrine and mini&s;try he was earne&s;t and zealous, elo|quent

<PB N="272" REF="293">in his di&s;cour&s;e, and perfect and ready in the &s;criptures. In his labour, and pains-taking, he con|tinued indefatigable to the end of his life: neither did promotion change him, nor dainty fare corrupt him. He was of a &s;trong body, &s;ound health, pregnant wit, and of invincible patience; &s;pare of diet, &s;pare of words, and &s;pare&s;t of time: a liberal hou&s;ekeeper, and very grave in his deportment. Being at length called to preach before King Edward, he was created Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of his &s;cruples about the epi&s;copal habits, page 130 of this volume.</NOTE>, where he remained two years, and then of Worce&s;ter; where he behaved &s;o uprightly and inoffen&s;ively, that his enemies had nothing to &s;ay again&s;t him. He u&s;ed to go about among the diffe|rent towns and villages of his dioce&s;e to preach to the people: and he &s;o governed his own hou&s;e, that there was nothing to be found in it, but good exam|ple, hone&s;t conver&s;ation, and reading of the &s;criptures. In his hall, he kept daily a table &s;pread with good &s;tore of victuals, for the poor people of the city of Wor|ce&s;ter, by turns: and, when they were &s;erved (being before examined by him&s;elf or his deputies, of the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and ten commandments) then he him&s;elf &s;at down to dinner, and not before.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary, he was &s;ent for, by a pur&s;uivant, to London; and though he had opportunity, and was per&s;uaded by his friends to fly, he refu&s;ed, &s;aying, <HI>Once I did fly; but now being called to this place, and vocation, I am re&s;olved to &s;tay, and to live and die with my &s;heep.</HI></P>
<P>When he came to London in Augu&s;t, Gardiner committed him, on September 1, to pri&s;on, with &s;ome bitter reproaches; afterwards al&s;o, at his examination, they called him bea&s;t, hypocrite, &amp;c. which he bore with great patience. In the Fleet, where he was con|fined, he had nothing but a pad of &s;traw for a bed, and a rotten covering, till &s;ome people &s;ent him a bed

Concerning his ba&s;e u&s;age in pri&s;on, he him&s;elf thus writes: <HI>I paid always to the warden of the Fleet as a Baron paid, as well in fees, as for my board,</HI> viz <HI>twenty &s;hillings per week, till I was wrongfully de|prived of my bi&s;hopric, and after that time I paid as the be&s;t gentleman in the hou&s;e; yet he always u&s;ed me wor&s;e, and more vilely than a very &s;lave. Thus I &s;uffered im|pri&s;onment almo&s;t eighteen months, my goods, living, friends, and comfort, being taken from me: the Queen owing me above eighty pounds, yet hath &s;he ca&s;t me in pri&s;on, and allows me nothing; neither are any &s;uffered to come at me, whereby I may be relieved. I am under a wicked man, and woman, and &s;ee no remedy but in God's help: but I commit my ju&s;t cau&s;e to him, who&s;e will be done, whether it be by life or death.</HI></P>
<P>When he was brought to examination before Gardi|ner, and the other commi&s;&s;ioners, on January 21, 1555, there was &s;uch a noi&s;e and tumult whenever he began to &s;peak, that he was forced to be &s;ilent; neverthele&s;s they proceeded to degrade and condemn him, and then delivered him over to the &s;ecular power. As they were carrying him to Newgate, one of the Sheriffs a&s;ked him why he was &s;o ha&s;ty and quick with the Lord Chancellor, and u&s;ed no more patience to him? To which he an&s;wered, "Mr. Sheriff, I was nothing at all impatient, though I was earne&s;t in my Ma&s;ter's cau&s;e: and it &s;tands me in hand &s;o to be; for it goeth upon life and death, not in this world only, but in the world to come." After his degradation, he lay &s;ix days a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in Newgate, none of his friends being &s;uffered to come to him: during which time Bonner, Harpsfield, and &s;everal others came to him, u&s;ing various means to bring him to recant: but they found him &s;tedfa&s;t and immoveable. On February 4, his keeper gave him &s;ome hints, that he &s;hould be &s;ent to Glouce&s;ter to be burnt, which he rejoiced at exceed|ingly, lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, and prai&s;ing God that he &s;hould be &s;ent among&s;t the people

And immediately he &s;ent for his boots, &s;purs, and cloak, that he might be ready to ride when they &s;hould call for him. The day following, he was delivered to &s;ome of the Queen's guard, who conveyed him to Glouce&s;ter on the 7th. When he came near the city, he was met by numbers of the people, who lamented his &s;ituation. Next day Sir Anthony King&s;ton, coming to him, told him, that life was &s;weet, and death bitter. To which he an&s;wered, "the death to come is more bitter, and the life to come more &s;weet. I am come hither to end this life, and &s;uffer death, becau&s;e I will not gain|&s;ay the truth I have formerly taught you here."</P>
<P>Being delivered to the Sheriff on February 9, being market-day, he &s;aid to him, My reque&s;t to you, Mr. Sheriff, is, only that there may be a quick fire, &s;oon to make an end of me, and in the mean time I will be as obedient to you as you can de&s;ire: if you think I do ami&s;s in any thing, hold up your finger, and I have done. I might have had my life, with much worldly gain, but I am willing to offer up my life for the truth, and tru&s;t to die a faithful &s;ervant to God, and a true &s;ubject to the Queen. When he &s;aw the Sheriffs men with &s;o many weapons, he &s;aid, "This is more than needs; if you had willed me, I would have gone to the &s;take, and have troubled none of you all." As he went to the place appointed for his exe|tion (which was oppo&s;ite to the college of prie&s;ts, where he u&s;ed to preach) he was forbid to preach to the people. His looks were chearful, and his coun|tenance more ruddy than u&s;ual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was dre&s;t in a gown of his landlord's; had a hat on his head, and a &s;taff in his hand, to &s;upport him, as the &s;ciatica, which he had contracted in pri&s;on, made him halt.</NOTE>. Being come to the
<PB N="275" REF="298">&s;take, he prayed about half an hour, whereof the following is a part; "Lord, I am hell, but thou art heaven: I am a &s;ink of &s;in, but thou art a gracious and a merciful Redeemer. Have mercy, therefore, upon me a mo&s;t mi&s;erable and wretched offender, after thy great mercy, and according to thine ine&s;timable goodne&s;s. Thou art a&s;cended into heaven, receive me to partake of thy joys, where thou fitte&s;t in equal glory with thy Father. For well knowe&s;t thou, Lord, wherefore I am come hither to &s;uffer, and why the wicked do per&s;ecute thy poor &s;ervant: not for my &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions committed again&s;t thee, but becau&s;e I will not allow of their wicked doings, to the contaminating of thy blood, and to the denial of the knowledge of thy truth, wherewith it did plea&s;e thee by thy Holy Spirit to in&s;truct me. With as much di|ligence as a poor wretch might (being thereto called) I have &s;et forth thy glory. Thou well &s;ee&s;t, O Lord my God, what terrible torments, and cruel pains, are prepared for thy poor creature: even &s;uch, Lord, as, without thy &s;trength, none is able to bear or patiently to pa&s;s; but that which is impo&s;&s;ible with man is po&s;&s;ible with thee. Therefore &s;trengthen me of thy goodne&s;s, that in the fire I break not the rules of pa|tience, or el&s;e a&s;&s;wage the terror of the pains; as &s;hall &s;eem fitte&s;t to thy glory."</P>
<P>When he was in the mid&s;t of his prayer, a box with a pardon being &s;et before him, he cried, "If you love my &s;oul, away with it; if you love my &s;oul, away with it;" and then proceeded in his devotion. When his prayer was done, he prepared him&s;elf for the &s;take, and was undre&s;t to his &s;hirt, which he tru&s;&s;ed between his legs, where he had a bag of gunpowder, and another under each arm. Three iron hoops being prepared to fa&s;ten him to the &s;take, he only put one of them round his middle, bidding them take away the re&s;t, &s;aying, I doubt not but God will give me &s;trength to bide the extremity of the fire without
<PB N="276" REF="299">binding. When reeds were ca&s;t to him, he embraced and ki&s;&s;ed them, putting them under his arms. When fire was fir&s;t put to him, the faggots being green, and the wind blowing away the flame, he was but &s;corch|ed: more faggots being laid to him, the fire was &s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, that his nether parts were burned, his up|per being &s;carce touched. He prayed mildly, as one that felt no pain, "O Je&s;us, the &s;on of David, have mercy upon me, and receive my &s;oul:" and, wiping his eyes with his hands, he &s;aid, "For God's love, let me have more fire." A third fire being kindled, it burned more violently, yet he was alive in it a great while; the la&s;t words he uttered being, "Lord Je&s;us have mercy on me, Lord Je&s;us receive my &s;pirit:" and then gave up the gho&s;t.</P>
<P>He was above three quarters of an hour in the fire before he died; yet he patiently &s;uffered the extremity thereof, neither moving forwards, backwards, or to any &s;ide: and having his nether parts burned, and his bowels fallen out, he quietly expired<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bi&s;hop Ridley's letter to him, in note, page 215 of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of Dr.</HI> ROWLAND TAYLOR.</HEAD>
<P>ROWLAND TAYLOR was Doctor of both laws, and par&s;on of Hadley in Suffolk, where Thomas Bilney had formerly been a preacher<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See note, page 421 of vol ii. of this work.</NOTE>, and in which place there were few, either men or women, that were not well learned in the holy &s;criptures, many having read over the whole Bible, and could &s;ay a deal of St. Paul's Epi&s;tles by heart. There Dr. Taylor preached con&s;tantly on Sundays, holydays, and other times when he could get the people together. So &s;oon as he was called to this place, he left the family of Dr. Cranmer, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, with whom he had former|ly
<PB N="277" REF="300">lived, and, like a good &s;hepherd, con&s;tantly abode with his flock, and gave him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tudy of the &s;acred writings, mo&s;t faithfully endeavouring to fulfil the precept of Chri&s;t to Peter, <HI>Love&s;t thou me? Feed my &s;heep</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xxi.</NOTE> His life and conver&s;ation were very examplary, and full of holine&s;s: he was meek and humble, yet would &s;toutly rebuke &s;in in tho&s;e of the highe&s;t rank: very mild, void of all rancour and malice, ready to do good to all men, forgiving his enemies, and far from doing wrong to any. He was a father to the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, cau&s;ing the pari&s;hioners to make good provi&s;ion for them, be&s;ides what he gave them out of his own bounty. He brought up his own children in the fear of God and in good learning: and continued all the days of King Edward in this holy and exemplary exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>In the beginning of Mary's reign, a prie&s;t was pro|cured, by &s;ome of the Popi&s;h party, to come and &s;ay ma&s;s in his church. Being at his &s;tudy, and hearing the bell toll, he went to the church, and finding the prie&s;t guarded with drawn &s;words, in his robes, ready to begin the ma&s;s, he &s;aid to him, "Thou Devil, who made thee &s;o bold to enter into this church, to pro|fane and defile it with this abominable idolatry? I command thee, thou Popi&s;h wolf, in the name of God, to avoid hence, and not to pre&s;ume thus to poi|&s;on Chri&s;t's flock."&mdash;Then &s;aid one Fo&s;ter, the ring|leader in this bu&s;ine&s;s, to Taylor, "Thou traitor, what do&s;t thou here, to let and di&s;turb the Queen's proceedings?" Dr. Taylor an&s;wered, "I am no trai|tor, but the &s;hepherd which God, and my Lord Chri&s;t, hath appointed to feed this flock; and therefore I have good authority to be here." After &s;ome more alter|cations, Fo&s;ter, and his armed men, forced the Doctor out of the church, and the prie&s;t went on with the ma&s;s. Soon after, Fo&s;ter wrote a complaint again&s;t
<PB N="278" REF="301">him to Gardiner, who &s;ent his letters-mi&s;&s;ive for him; whereupon his friends earne&s;tly entreated him to fly, telling him, that he could neither expect ju&s;tice, nor favour, but impri&s;onment, and cruel death: but he an&s;wered, "I know my cau&s;e to be &s;o good and righte|ous, and the truth &s;o &s;trong upon my &s;ide, that I will, by God's grace, appear before them, and to their beards re&s;i&s;t their fal&s;e doings; for I believe, that I &s;hall never be able to do God &s;o good &s;ervice as now, and that I &s;hall never have &s;o glorious a calling, nor &s;o great mercy of God profered me as I have now: therefore pray for me, and I doubt not but God will give me &s;trength, and his holy &s;pirit, that all my ad|ver&s;aries &s;hall be a&s;hamed of their doings." His friends repre&s;ented to him, that he had &s;ufficiently done his duty, and been witne&s;s to the truth, both in his &s;er|mons, and re&s;i&s;ting the Popi&s;h prie&s;t, and advi&s;ed him to re&s;erve him&s;elf for better times; but he an&s;wered, "I am now old, and have already lived too long to &s;ee the&s;e terrible and wicked days. You may do as your con&s;ciences &s;erve you, but I am re&s;olved not to fly: God will hereafter rai&s;e up teachers, which &s;hall with much more diligence and fruit teach than I have done; for God will not for&s;ake his church, though for a time he trieth and correcteth us, and that not without ju&s;t cau&s;e."</P>
<P>His friends, &s;eeing his con&s;tancy and re&s;olution, with tears recommended him to God; and &s;o preparing him&s;elf he went to London, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf be|fore Gardiner the Lord Chancellor, who reviled him, calling him knave, traitor, heretic, a&s;king him if he knew who he was? To which Taylor replied, "Yea, I know you, and all your greatne&s;s; yet you are but a mortal man: and if I &s;hould be afraid of your lordly looks, why fear you not God the Lord of us all? How dare you for &s;hame look any Chri&s;tian in the face, &s;ee|ing you have for&s;aken the truth, denied our Saviour Chri&s;t and his word, and done contrary to your own
<PB N="279" REF="302">oath and writing? With what countenance can you ap|pear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, and an&s;wer for your oath, fir&s;t made to Henry VIII. and afterwards to Edward VI.?" Gardiner told him, that was Herod's oath, unlawful, and therefore fit to be broke; and thank|ed God that he had broke it, and returned to the church of Rome, which he advi&s;ed Taylor al&s;o to do. Tay|lor &s;aid, "Should I for&s;ake the church of Chri&s;t, which is founded upon the true foundation of the Pro|phets and Apo&s;tles, to approve tho&s;e lies, errors, &s;u|per&s;titions, and idolatries, that are approved of mo&s;t bla&s;phemou&s;ly by you? God forbid. Remember that you wrote truly again&s;t the Pope, and were &s;worn a|gain&s;t him." Upon which Gardiner abu&s;ed him with reviling language, calling him an arrogant knave, and a very fool. Taylor de&s;ired him to leave his railing, &s;aid it was un&s;eemly in one of his &s;tation, and bid him remember, that he that calls his brother &s;ool is in danger of hell fire. On Gardiner's upbraiding him for being a married man, Taylor &s;aid, "Yea, and I thank God that I am, and have had nine children, all in lawful matrimony; and ble&s;&s;ed be God that ordained matrimony, and commanded, that all that had not the gift of continency &s;hould marry, and not live in whoredom and adultery." After &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e, the Bi&s;hop committed him to the King's Bench pri&s;on, where he lay almo&s;t two years.</P>
<P>In pri&s;on he &s;pent his time in prayer, reading the &s;criptures, preaching to the pri&s;oners, and to others that re&s;orted to him: and it plea&s;ed God, that he found in that pri&s;on Mr. Bradford, whom he exhorted to faith; &s;trength, and patience, and to per&s;evere con|&s;tantly unto the end. Bradford thanked God who had provided him &s;o comfortable a fellow pri&s;oner, and they both together prai&s;ed God, and continued in prayer, reading, and exhorting one another; in&s;omuch as Dr. Taylor told his friends, that God had provided graci|ou&s;ly for him, to &s;end him to that pri&s;on, where he
<PB N="280" REF="303">found &s;uch an angel of God, to be in his company to comfort him. He was &s;everal times examined concern|ing his faith, and at la&s;t was condemned to die. When the &s;entence was read, he told them, that God, the righteous judge, would require his blood at their hands, and that the proude&s;t of them all &s;hould re|pent their receiving of Antichri&s;t again, and their per|&s;ecution of the flock of Chri&s;t. He al&s;o thus wrote to his friends, "God be prai&s;ed, &s;ince my condemnation, I was never afraid to die. God's will be done. If I &s;hrink from God's truth, I am &s;ure of another manner of death than had Judge Hales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 193 of this volume.</NOTE>. But God be prai&s;ed, even from the bottom of my heart, I am unmoveably &s;ettled upon the rock, nothing doubting but that my dear God will perform and fini&s;h the work that he has begun in me and others. To him be all honour, both now and ever, through Chri&s;t our only Saviour. Amen."</P>
<P>After his condemnation, Bonner came to the pri&s;on to degrade him, bringing all the garments u&s;ed by the prie&s;ts in officiating at ma&s;s, which Taylor refu&s;ed to put on, till it was done forcibly; when Dr. Taylor, &s;etting his hands by his &s;ides, walked up and down, and &s;aid, "How &s;ay you now, my Lord, am I not a goodly fool? If I were in Cheap&s;ide, would not all the boys laugh at the&s;e api&s;h toys?" The Bi&s;hop, having de&s;poiled him of all, would have given him a &s;troke on his brea&s;t with his cro&s;ier: But his chaplain &s;aid, My Lord, &s;trike him not, for he will &s;urely &s;trike again. "Yea, by St. Peter, will I, &s;aid Taylor; the cau&s;e is Chri&s;t's, and I were no good Chri&s;tian, If I would not fight in my ma&s;ter's quarrel." Then the Bi&s;hop cur&s;ed him, but dur&s;t not &s;trike him: to whom Dr. Taylor an&s;wered, "Though you cur&s;e, yet God doth ble&s;s me." Next night his wife, &s;on, and &s;ervant, came to him, where before &s;upper they kneeled down and pray|ed,
<PB N="281" REF="304">&s;aying the Litany. Being &s;ent down to Hadley to be burned, he was very chearful all the journey, as one going to a banquet or bridal. On the way, the Sheriff of E&s;&s;ex much per&s;uaded him to return to the Popi&s;h religion; to whom he at la&s;t &s;aid, "I well per|ceive now that I have been deceived my&s;elf, and &s;hall deceive many in Hadley of their expectation." When the Sheriff de&s;ired him to explain his meaning, hoping that he would recant, he &s;aid, "I am a man of a very great carca&s;s, which I hoped &s;hould have been buried in Hadley church-yard; but I &s;ee I am deceived: and there are a great number of worms there, which &s;hould have had jolly feeding on this carrion, but now both I and they &s;hall be deceived of our expectation." When he came within two miles of Hadley, he de&s;ired to alight; and being down, he leapt, and gave a fri&s;k or two, &s;aying, "God be prai&s;ed, I am now almo&s;t at home, and have not above two &s;tiles to go over, and I am even at my Father's hou&s;e." At Hadley town's end, a poor man, with five children, met him, crying, "O dear father and good &s;hepherd, God help and &s;uccour thee, as thou ha&s;t many a time &s;uccoured me, and my poor children." The &s;treets were filled with people, weeping, and lamenting their lo&s;s of &s;uch an excellent preacher: To whom he &s;aid, "I have preach|ed to you God's word and truth, and am now come to &s;eal it with my blood. He gave all his money to the poor, for whom he was wont to provide formerly. Once a fortnight at lea&s;t he u&s;ed to call upon Sir Henry Doile, and other rich clothiers, to go with him to the alms hou&s;es, to &s;ee what the poor lacked in meat, drink, apparel, and other nece&s;&s;aries; withal exhorting, comforting, and rebuking, as he &s;aw occa&s;ion. Com|ing to the place of execution, on February 9, 1555, he was not &s;uffered to &s;peak to the people, yet he was very chearful, &s;aying, "Thanks be to God, I am even at home:" and when he had prayed, and made ready, he came to the &s;take and ki&s;&s;ed it. He would
<PB N="282" REF="305">fain have &s;poken to the people, but one thru&s;t a tip|&s;taff into his mouth, another &s;truck him on the head, and another threw a faggot at him, which broke his face, that the blood ran down: to whom Dr. Taylor &s;aid, "O friend, I have harm enough, what needed that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 214 of this volume.</NOTE>?" When he was &s;aying the P&s;alm <HI>Mi&s;erere</HI> in Engli&s;h, Sir John Shelton &s;truck him on the lips, &s;ay|ing, "You knave, I will make you &s;peak Latin." The fire being kindled, he held up his hands, calling upon God, and &s;aying, "Merciful Father of Heaven, for Je&s;us Chri&s;t my Saviour's &s;ake, receive my &s;oul into thy hands." and &s;o &s;tood &s;till, without moving, till one, with an halbert, &s;truck out his brains.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> JOHN BRADFORD.</HEAD>
<P>John Bradford was born at Manche&s;ter in Lanca|&s;hire, and by his parents brought up to learning; and afterwards he &s;erved Sir John Harrington, a man much employed under Henry VIII. and Edward VI. in which place he had opportunity of greatly advantaging him&s;elf; for his ma&s;ter found him &s;o active, and fit for his employments, that above all others he made mo&s;t u&s;e of his faithful &s;ervice; and he continued with him &s;everal years.</P>
<P>But the divine plea&s;ures intending him for better em|ployment, having given up a ju&s;t account to his ma&s;|ter, with his approbation, he went to Cambridge, where, by his diligence in &s;tudy, he profited &s;o much in knowledge, and &s;o plea&s;ed all, by his godly and blamele&s;s conver&s;ation, that, after one year's abode in the univer&s;ity, he was made Ma&s;ter of Arts, and cho|&s;en Fellow of Pembroke-hall. There Bucer falling into acquaintance with him, per&s;uaded him to enter into the mini&s;try, which he mode&s;tly excu&s;ed for want of learning: but Bucer &s;aid, "If thou have not
<PB N="283" REF="306">fine manchet, yet give the people barley-bread, or &s;uch as thou ha&s;t." Being thus per&s;uaded to enter into the mini&s;try, Bi&s;hop Ridley made him a Prebendary of St. Paul's, where he continued preaching three years faithfully, reproving fin &s;harply, and pithily impugn|ing errors and here&s;ies, and per&s;uading to a godly life. In the beginning of Queen Mary's reign, Bourne, Bi|&s;hop of Bath, made a &s;editious &s;ermon at St. Paul's cro&s;s, which &s;o enraged the populace, that they were ready to pull him out of the pulpit, and one threw a dagger at him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 181 of this volume.</NOTE>; whereupon Bourne reque&s;ted Brad|ford (who was behind him) to &s;tand in his place, and to quiet the people, which he accordingly did, and afterwards &s;afely conveyed Bourne to his hou&s;e; on which one &s;aid to him, "Ah, Bradford, Bradford, thou &s;ave&s;t him that will help to burn thee." In the afternoon Bradford preached at Bow-church, and &s;harply reprimanded the people for their carriage: yet within three days after, he was &s;ent for before the coun|cil, charged with &s;edition for this act, and committed pri&s;oner to the Tower. From thence they removed him to the King's Bench; and after his condemnation he was &s;ent to the Counter in the Poultry; in which places, during the time that he remained pri&s;oner, he preached twice a-day, unle&s;s &s;ickne&s;s prevented it, and often admini&s;tered the &s;acrament. Preaching, reading, and prayer, were the chief plea&s;ures of his life. He was in &s;uch credit with his keeper in the King's Bench, that &s;ometimes in the evening he would give him leave, on his bare word, to go into London to vi&s;it a &s;ick friend; and he was &s;o mindful of his promi&s;e, that he u&s;ed to return to pri&s;on again, rather before his hour than after. He was of per&s;on &s;omewhat tall and &s;len|der, &s;pare of body, of a faint &s;anguine colour, and an auburn beard. He &s;lept little, his recreation was ho|ne&s;t company, and Chri&s;tian di&s;cour&s;e a little after din|ner
<PB N="284" REF="307">and then to his book again. He counted the hour ill &s;pent that was not employed in doing &s;ome good, either with his pen, &s;tudy, or exhorting others. He was no niggard of his pur&s;e, but would liberally communicate what he had to his fellow-pri&s;oners. Once a-week he vi&s;ited the thieves on the other &s;ide of the pri&s;on, giving them godly exhortations, and di&s;|tributing &s;ome money among them. An intimate friend of his a&s;ked him, if he &s;hould procure his liber|ty, what he would do, and where he would go? To whom he an&s;wered, that he cared not whither he were delivered out of pri&s;on or no; but if he &s;hould, that then he would marry, and abide &s;ecretly in England, and teach the people as the time would &s;uffer him. He was had in great e&s;teem and admiration of all good men: &s;o that many who only knew him by report, much lamented his death; and even many of the oppo&s;ite party wi&s;hed he might live. Few days pa&s;&s;ed, wherein he &s;hed not &s;ome tears before he went to bed: nor was there any pri&s;oner with him but received &s;ome profit by him. He had many opportunities of e&s;caping, but would not embrace them. The night before he was carried to Newgate, he dreamed that chains were brought for him to the Counter, and that the next day he &s;hould be carried to Newgate, and the day follow|ing be certainly burned at Smithfield; which accord|ingly came to pa&s;s: for that day, in the afternoon, the Keeper's wife came running into his chamber, &s;aying, O Mr. Bradford, I bring you heavy news, for to|morrow you mu&s;t be burned; your chain is now a buying, and pre&s;ently you mu&s;t go to Newgate. At this, Mr. Bradford put off his cap, lifting up his eyes to heaven, and &s;aid, "I thank God for it: I have looked for this a long time, it comes not to me &s;uddenly, but as a thing waited for every day and hour: the Lord make me worthy thereof. He &s;pent the re&s;t of the evening in prayers. The morning be|fore he was burned, as he was putting on a clean &s;hirt,
<PB N="285" REF="308">in which he was to &s;uffer, he made &s;uch a prayer of the wedding-garment, that every one pre&s;ent were in great admiration. At his departing out of his cham|ber, he prayed earne&s;tly, and gave money to every &s;ervant and officer in the hou&s;e, exhorting them to fear and &s;erve God, labouring to avoid all manner of evil. Then turning about to the wall, he prayed vehemently, that the words he had &s;poken in them might not be in vain, but that the Lord would work effectually for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. During his impri&s;onment, he had been oft examined before the Bi&s;hops, and profered life, if he would recant: but he an&s;wered, "Life with God's di&s;plea&s;ure is wor&s;e than death; and death in his true favour is true life." When he came into Smithfield (where another young man was to &s;uffer with him) he fell on his face and prayed; then taking a faggot in his hand, he ki&s;&s;ed it and the &s;take al&s;o; and pulling off his cloaths, he &s;tood by the &s;take, and, lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven, &s;aid, "O England, England, repent of thy &s;ins, repent of thy &s;ins; be|ware of idolatry, beware of Antichri&s;ts, take heed they do not deceive thee." After that turning his head to the young man, he &s;aid, "Be of good comfort, brother, for we &s;hall have a merry &s;upper with the Lord this night." Then embracing the reeds, he &s;aid, "Strait is the way, and narrow is the gate, that leadeth to eternal &s;alvation, and few there be that find it;" and then the faggots being kindled, he &s;oon ex|pired in the flames, A. D. 1555.</P>
<P>He was very charitable, in&s;omuch as in a hard time he &s;old his chains, rings, and jewels, to relieve tho&s;e that were in want. In his examination before Gardiner, he often told him that he had &s;worn &s;ix times never to admit the authority of the Bi&s;hop of Rome; and therefore, if he examined him as a dele|gate from him, he dur&s;t not an&s;wer him, left he &s;hould break his oath.

But, O Lord, unto thy hands I commend it, come what will, only &s;anctify thy name in me, as in an in&s;trument of thy grace. Now a&s;k me what you will." Gardiner asked him, "What think you of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament? Do you not believe Chri&s;t's real pre&s;ence there, in his natural body?" Bradford replied. "My Lord, I do not believe that Chri&s;t is corporally pre&s;ent in the &s;acrament, but that he is pre|&s;ent there to the faith of the due receiver. As for tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, I plainly and flatly believe it not." In a letter to his mother and brethren, he thus writes: "I am now in pri&s;on, &s;ure enough from &s;tarting, and I thank God I am ready with my life and blood to &s;eal tho&s;e truths which I have preached to you, if God &s;hall account me worthy of that honour; for it is a &s;pecial benefit of God to &s;uffer for his name, and go&s;|pel, as now I do; I heartily thank him for it, and am &s;ure that I &s;hall be partaker of his glory.

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. NICHOLAS RIDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>Nicholas Ridley was born at Willymond&s;wyke in Northumberland, of wor&s;hipful parents, and educated in grammatical learning at Newca&s;tle, and from thence &s;ent to Cambridge, where he continued till he was bachelor of arts; he then went to Oxford, and was there elected Fellow of Univer&s;ity-college in 1521. After that returning to Cambridge, he was cho&s;en ma&s;ter of Pembroke hall, and made Doctor in divi|nity. From thence he was called by Archbi&s;hop Cranmer to be vicar of Herne in Ea&s;t Kent, where he was a fruitful and painful preacher, at which time he became a favourer of the reformation. After &s;ome time, he was made a prebendary of the cathedral church of Canterbury: but not liking his &s;ociety there, he travelled into France, and &s;tudied at Paris and Louvain. At his return he was made chaplain to King Henry VIII. and in 1547 con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter. He was tran&s;lated from thence on April 1,
<PB N="288" REF="313">1553, the 4th of Edward VI. to the &s;ee of London, in the room of the deprived Bi&s;hop Bonner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page III of this volume.</NOTE>: and in both his dioce&s;es he took &s;o great pains in preach|ing, that he was dearly beloved of his flock, to whom al&s;o he was &s;ingularly exemplary in his life; &s;o that even his enemies had nothing to &s;ay again&s;t his conduct. Every Sunday and holiday he preached in one place or another, except extraordinary occa&s;ions prevented him. He was very well learned, and of &s;uch reading that he de&s;erved to be numbered among&s;t the greate&s;t &s;cholars that the&s;e latter ages have produ|ced; as appeared by his works, &s;ermons, and &s;undry di&s;putations in both univer&s;ities. He had a &s;trong me|mory, a deep wit, was very judicious and very merciful. His per&s;on was comely, and well-proportioned in all points. He was free from malice, and &s;oon forgot all injuries done again&s;t him; very kind to his kindred, if they behaved well. He u&s;ed all means to mortify his fle&s;h, being much inclined to prayer and contem|plation; was &s;ober in di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ometimes facetious and merry at meals, after which he u&s;ed to play at che&s;s about an hour, and then retired to his &s;tudy, till five o'clock in the evening, when coming down, he, after prayers in his family, went to &s;upper, then played a game at che&s;s, and returned to his &s;tudy till eleven o'clock. He daily read a lecture at prayer-time to his family, giving every one that could read a New Te&s;tament, and hiring them with money to learn chapters by heart, being very careful that his family &s;hould &s;et an exam|ple of godline&s;s and virtue to others. He maintained Nicholas Heath, the depo&s;ed Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 146 of this volume.</NOTE>, for a year and an half, in the &s;ame &s;plendor, as if the epi&s;copal palace at Fulham had been that Prelate's own: and Bi&s;hop Bonner's mother (whom he affectionately called his own mother, though her behaviour merited no friend&s;hip from him, he had con&s;tantly at meals

He was fir&s;t converted by reading a book on the &s;acrament, written by Bertram in the ninth century, and much confirmed by conferences with Dr. Cranmer and Peter Martyr.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary, he was impri&s;oned with Cranmer in the Tower$<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 173 of this volume.</NOTE>, and from thence &s;ent, with that prelate and Latimer, to Oxford, and there kept in the common goal; till at length, being &s;eparated from the others, he was com|mitted to the cu&s;tody of one Iri&s;h, with whom he continued till the day of his death. Writing to Lati|mer in pri&s;on, he &s;aith, "I pray you, good Father, let me have &s;omething more from you to comfort my heart; for except the Lord a&s;&s;i&s;t me in his &s;ervice, I &s;hall play the part but of a white-livered knight; but he can make a coward in his cau&s;e fight like a man." In a letter to Mr Bradford, he &s;ays, "As far as Lon|don is from Oxford, yet thence we have received both meat, money and &s;hirts, not only from our acquain|tance, but from &s;ome &s;trangers." And again, he &s;ays, "Ever &s;ince I heard of our dear brother Rogers his &s;tout confe&s;&s;ion and departing (ble&s;&s;ed be God for it) I never felt any lumpi&s;h heavine&s;s in my heart as &s;ome|times I did before. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, notwith&s;tanding our hard re&s;traints, and the evil reports rai&s;ed of us, we are merry in God; and all our care is, and &s;hall be (by God's grace) to plea&s;e and &s;erve him, from whom we expect, after the&s;e temporary and momentary mi&s;eries, to have eternal joy and perpetual felicity, with Abra|ham, I&s;aac, Jacob, &amp;c. As yet never a learned man, &s;cholar or other, hath vi&s;ited us, &s;ince our coming to Bocardo, which now may be called the college of <HI>Quondams;</HI> for we be no fewer than three, and I dare &s;ay every one well contented with his &s;ituation, which is

<P>Writing to Grindal, who was then in exile, he thus informs him of his condition. "I was about two months clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the Tower, after that (without my &s;eeking) I had the liberty of the Tower granted me, and &s;o I continued about half a year, till, refu&s;ing to be pre&s;ent at ma&s;s, I was &s;hut up clo&s;e pri&s;oner again. The la&s;t Lent but one, by rea&s;on of their ri&s;ing in Kent, the Tower was &s;o full of pri&s;oners, that my Lord Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, Ma&s;ter Latimer, Mr. Bradford, and my&s;elf, were all put into one pri&s;on, where we remained till almo&s;t Ea&s;ter, and then Dr. Cranmer, Ma&s;ter Latimer, and my&s;elf, were &s;ent down to Oxford, and were &s;uffered to have nothing with us, but what we carried upon us. About Whit&s;untide following was our di&s;putations at Oxford, after which we had pen, ink, and all things, taken from us, yea, and our own &s;ervants were removed from us, and &s;trangers &s;et in their &s;teads, and all of us kept apart, as we are unto this day. God be ble&s;&s;ed, we are all three in health, and of good chear, and have looked long ago to have been di&s;patched; for within a day or two after our di&s;putations we were condemned for heretics: the Lord's will be fulfilled in us, &amp;c."</P>
<P>When he was brought before the Pope's delegate (John White Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, and other commi&s;|&s;ioners) in the divinity-&s;chool in Oxford, whil&s;t the commi&s;&s;ion was reading, he &s;tood bare, till he heard the Cardinal named, and the Pope's holine&s;s, and then he put on his cap; and being admoni&s;hed by the Bi&s;hop to pull it off, he an&s;wered, I do not put it on in con|tempt of your lord&s;hip, but that by this my behaviour I may make it appear, that I acknowledge in no re|&s;pect the u&s;urped &s;upremacy of Rome; and therefore I utterly de&s;pi&s;e and condemn all authority coming from
<PB N="291" REF="316">the Pope. Then the Bi&s;hop commanded the beadle to pull off his cap, and Ridley bowing his head, &s;uf|fered him quietly to do it. After &s;everal examina|tions, he was at la&s;t degraded, and condemned to be burnt. The night before he &s;uffered, he cau&s;ed his beard to be &s;haven, and his feet wa&s;hed, and invited his ho&s;te&s;s, and the re&s;t at the table, to his wedding. He al&s;o a&s;ked his brother, whether his &s;i&s;ter could find in her heart to be pre&s;ent at it? Yea, &s;aid he, I dare &s;ay with all her heart. His ho&s;te&s;s weeping, he &s;aid, "O Mi&s;tre&s;s Iri&s;h, I &s;ee now that you love me not, for in that you weep, it appears that you will not be at my marriage, nor are therewith content. I &s;ee you are not &s;o much my friend as I thought; but quiet your&s;elf, though my breakfa&s;t be &s;omewhat &s;harp and painful, yet I am &s;ure my &s;upper &s;hall be more &s;weet and plea&s;ant." His brother offering to watch with him, he refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, "I intend to go to bed, and &s;leep as quietly as ever I did in my life." In the morning, he came forth in a fair black gown, faced with foins, and a tippet of velvet, &amp;c. and looking behind him he &s;pied Latimer, coming after him, to whom he &s;aid, "O be you there?" "Yea, &s;aid Lati|mer, have after as fa&s;t as I can follow." Coming to the &s;take, he lift up his hands and eyes to heaven, and running to Latimer with a chearful countenance, em|braced, ki&s;&s;ed, and comforted him, &s;aying, "Be of good heart, brother, for God will either a&s;&s;wage the fury of the flame, or give us &s;trength to abide it." He then went to the &s;take, kneeled by it, ki&s;&s;ed it, and prayed earne&s;tly; and being about to &s;peak, his mouth was &s;topt by &s;ome that attended the execution. Being &s;tripped, he &s;tood upon a &s;tone by the &s;take, and &s;aid, "O heavenly Father, I give thee hearty thanks, for that thou ha&s;t called me to be a profe&s;&s;or of, thee even unto death. I be&s;eech thee, Lord God, have mercy upon this realm of England, and deliver it from all its enemies." As a &s;mith was knocking in
<PB N="292" REF="317">the &s;taple, which held the chain, he de&s;ired him to knock it in hard, for the fle&s;h would have its cour&s;e. His brother bringing him a bag of gunpowder, he a&s;ked what it was, and being told, &s;aid he would re|ceive it as &s;ent from God; and, when he &s;aw the flame a coming up to him, he cried with a loud voice, "Into thy hands, Lord, I commend my &s;pirit, Lord receive my &s;oul:" but the fire being kept down by the wood, he de&s;ired them for Chri&s;t's &s;ake to let the &s;ire come to him, which his brother-in-law mi&s;under&s;tand|ing, &s;till heaped on more faggots, whereby his legs were burned, before his upper parts were touched; at la&s;t his upper parts fell into the fire, and he gave up the gho&s;t. Bi&s;hop Ridley on a time cro&s;&s;ing the $hames, there ro&s;e on a &s;udden &s;uch a tempe&s;t, that all in the boat were a&s;toni&s;hed, expecting to be drowned: Rid|ley de&s;ired them not to fear, for the boat carried a Bi&s;hop that was to be burned, and not drowned. He &s;uffered in the fifty-fifth year of his age, on Octo|ber 10, 1555, in the Town-ditch, oppo&s;ite to Baliol college.</P>
<P>He was a man &s;o revered for his learning and know|le$ge in the &s;acr$d &s;criptures, that his very enemies $ere forced to acknowledge his excellence: and if his life might have been redeemed with money, Gre|gory Fiennes, Lord Dacres of the North<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 3$, 95, and 96 of this volume.</NOTE>, being his kin&s;man, would have given ten thou&s;and pounds rather than he &s;hould be burned. But &s;o unmerciful and cruel was Queen Mary's temper, that, notwith|&s;tanding $idley's gentlene's to her in the days of King Edward, &s;he would by no means be intreated to &s;pare his life.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. HUGH LATIMER.</HEAD>
<P>Hugh Latimer was born at Thirke&s;&s;on, in the county of Leice&s;ter, and, being of a ready apt di&s;po&s;ition, was, by his parents, brought up to learning, and went to Cambridge at the age of fourteen, where, after other &s;tudies, he applied him&s;elf to that of &s;chool-divinity, and commenced bachelor of divinity, being then a very zealous Papi&s;t. He made an oration again&s;t Philip Melancthon; railed again&s;t Mr. Staf|ford divinity-lecturer, and de&s;ired the &s;cholars in no ways to believe him. He was &s;o zealous in the Popi&s;h tenets, and therewith &s;o &s;crupulous, that, being a prie&s;t, he thought he had never &s;ufficiently mixed his
<PB N="294" REF="319">ma&s;&s;ing wine with water, and that he &s;hould never be damned, if once he was a profe&s;&s;ed Friar. He was cro&s;s-bearer in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and carried it on proce&s;&s;ion-days, till he was converted by profe&s;&s;or Bilney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, page 241 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>; who &s;eeing him very violent in his way, though without knowledge, endeavoured to remove his prejudices, and going to the cro&s;s-bearer's &s;tudy, de|&s;ired him to hear him make a confe&s;&s;ion of his faith; with which Latimer was &s;o touched, that he gave over &s;chool-divinity, and &s;tudied more orthodox divines: &s;o that, whereas before he was an enemy to, and almo&s;t a per&s;ecutor of, the favourers of a reformation, he was now zealous in their cau&s;e; changing his old manner of cavilling and railing, into diligent conferring with Bil|ney or others, and a&s;ked Stafford's pardon before he died. He was not &s;atisfied with his own conver&s;ion, but became a powerful public preacher; al&s;o in&s;truct|ing many in private: which &s;et many of the Doctors and Friars again&s;t him; and Nicholas We&s;t, Bi&s;hop of Ely; forbade him to preach, A. D. 1529: yet he con|tinued for three years preaching with much applau&s;e; even the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf admiring his talents.</P>
<P>Soon after, complaint was made again&s;t him to Car|dinal Wol&s;ey; but by the means of Dr. Butts, the King's phy&s;ician<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 56 of this volume.</NOTE> a favourer of good men, he was cho&s;en into the number of tho&s;e which laboured in the cau&s;e of the King's &s;upremacy. Whereupon he went to court, and lodged with Dr. Butts; but at la&s;t being weary of the court, he had, by the Lord Cromwell's means, a living given him in Wilt&s;hire. The place was called We&s;t King&s;ton, near Sarum, where he di|ligently in&s;tructed his flock, and preached zealou&s;ly many times abroad in the country. Hereupon &s;ome Roman Catholic prie&s;ts drew up articles again&s;t him; and he was much mole&s;ted by William Warham,
<PB N="295" REF="320">Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and John Stoke&s;ley Bi&s;hop of London, before whom he was cited to appear. They detained him a long time from his own curacy, calling him three times every week before them, which much troubled him: whereupon he wrote to the Archbi&s;hop, expo&s;tulating with him for &s;o long detaining him from his charge; and that not for any ju&s;t cau&s;e, but only for preaching the truth again&s;t abu&s;es which had crept into the church. Yet his application availed nothing, till the King re&s;cued him out of their hands, and, in 1535, at the reque&s;t of Lord Cromwell, made him Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 427 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>. In that &s;tation he conducted him&s;elf with great diligence and piety. He &s;pent his whole time in &s;tudy, teaching, preaching, exhorting, vi&s;iting, correcting, and reforming, to the utmo&s;t of his power, as far as the times would bear; and though he could not utterly extingui&s;h the reliques of Popery, yet he &s;o managed, that they &s;hould be u&s;ed with as little hurt, and as much profit as might be. Yet there he was not quiet, for one of great place accu&s;ed him to the King, of preaching &s;edition, but the King was &s;atisfied with the Prelate's an&s;wer. At New-year's tide, it was u&s;ual for the Bi&s;hops to pre&s;ent the King with a New-year's gift; and Bi&s;hop Latimer, among the re&s;t, pre|&s;ented him with the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> wrapped up in a napkin, with this in&s;cription about it, <HI>Fornicatores &amp; adulteros judicabit Dominus;</HI> "Whoremongers and adul|terers God will judge." But &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ing of the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, he, &s;eeing that he could not retain his office with a good con&s;cience<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See pages 12 and 13 of this volume.</NOTE>, of his own accord re&s;igned his bi&s;hopric; and, when he put off his rochet, in his chamber among his friends, he gave a &s;kip on the floor for joy, feeling his &s;houlders lighter (as he &s;aid) by being di&s;charged from &s;o heavy a bur|then. After which he betook him&s;elf to his former
<PB N="296" REF="321">mean par&s;onage: yet there, by the malice of &s;ome prie&s;ts, who &s;landered his doctrine, he was much en|dangered: and though, by Cranmer's means, be for &s;ome time e&s;caped their &s;nares, he was at la&s;t com|mitted to the Tower, where he remained till the reign of Edward VI. Being then re&s;tored to his liberty, he might al&s;o have been re&s;tored to his bi&s;hopric; but he cho&s;e to live in a private way with $$rchbi&s;hop Cran|mer; and conceiving that his preaching would be &s;er|viceable to religion, he continued a diligent and pain|ful preacher all that King's reign, in different places, though he was &s;ixty-&s;even years of age. He ro&s;e to his &s;tudy, winter and &s;ummer, at two o'clock in the morn|ing. He evidently fore&s;aw, and foretold, all tho&s;e plagues the nation afterwards felt under Queen Mary; and foretold, concerning him&s;elf, that his preaching the go&s;pel would co&s;t him his life, and that Stephen Gar|diner, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who was then in confine|ment, would be an in&s;trument of per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>In the beginning of Queen Mary's reign, he was &s;ent for by a pur&s;uivant, whereof he had notice &s;ix hours before he came to his hou&s;e; yet in&s;tead of fly|ing, he prepared him&s;elf for his journey, and, when the pur&s;uivant came, he &s;aid, "My friend, you are welcome; I go as willingly to London to give an ac|count of my faith, as ever I went to any place in the world; and I doubt not, but as God hath formerly made me worthy to preach his word before two excel|lent Princes, &s;o he will enable me to bear witne&s;s to the truth before the third, either to her eternal com|fort or di&s;comfort." The pur&s;uivant, having deliver|ed his letter, told him, that he was commanded not to &s;tay for him, and &s;o immediately departed; his ad|ver&s;aries hoping that he would have fled: but Latimer ha&s;ted after to London, and, as he rode through Smith|field, ob&s;erved that place had long groaned for him. Coming before the council, after many abu&s;es, he was committed to the Tower, where God gave him &s;trength
<PB N="297" REF="322">of mind, not only to bear the terriblene&s;s of impri&s;on|ment, but to deride and laugh to &s;corn the doings of his enemies. This aged father, who may ju&s;tly be &s;tiled the Demo&s;thenes of the pulpit, being kept in the cold winter without a fire, &s;ent the Lieutenant's &s;er|vant to tell his ma&s;ter, that, if he did not look better to him, perchance he might deceive him. The Lieu|tenant, th$nking that he intended to make an e&s;cape, charged him with his words; to whom he an&s;wered, "You think I &s;hall burn, but, unle&s;s you let me have a fire, I &s;hall deceive your expectation, for I am here like to &s;tarve with cold." He continued a long time in the Tower, with as much patience as any man could do in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and from thence was &s;ent to Ox|ford with Cranmer and Ridley<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an account of their di&s;putation there, page 220 of this volume.</NOTE>: where they &s;pent their time in fervent prayer and &s;tudy. Three things Latimer more e&s;pecially prayed for, 1&s;t, "That as God had appointed him to be a preacher of his word, &s;o that he would give him grace to &s;tand to his doc|trine, that he might give his heart's blood for the &s;ame." 2dly, "That God, of his mercy, would re|&s;tore his go&s;pel to England once again:" which he often inculcated in his prayer, and that with &s;o much ardour, as though he had &s;een God before him, and &s;poken to him face to face. 3dly, "That the Lord would pre&s;erve the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, and make her a comfort to the comfortle&s;s realm of England." All which reque&s;ts God mo&s;t graciou&s;ly an&s;wered. At la&s;t, being condemned, with Ridley, to be burned, when he came to the &s;take, he li&s;t up his eyes with an amiable and comfortable countenance, &s;aying, <HI>Fidelis e&s;t Deus,</HI> &amp;c. "God is faithful, who will not &s;uffer us to be tempted above that which we are able to bear." When the fire was brought, he &s;aid to Dr. Ridley, "Be of good comfort, brother, and play the man; we &s;hall
<PB N="298" REF="323">this day light &s;uch a candle, by God's grace, in Eng|land, as I tru&s;t &s;hall never be put out." Being &s;trip|ped, he &s;eemed a very comely per&s;on to all that were pre&s;ent, and whereas, in his cloaths, he appeared a withered, crooked, &s;illy old man, he now &s;tood bolt upright, as comely a father as one might behold. As he was burning, his blood ran out of his heart in &s;uch abundance, as if all the blood of his body had been gathered thither, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the be|holders, and according to his former reque&s;t, "that he might be &s;o happy as to &s;hed his heart's blood for the truth." When the fire was fir&s;t kindled, he cried, "O Father of Heaven, receive my &s;oul:" and &s;o re|ceiving the flame, and, as it were, embracing it, having &s;troked his face with his hands, and bathed them a lit|tle in the fire, he &s;oon expired, with very little &s;eem|ing pain, on October 16, 1555. In a letter to King Henry VIII. he thus concludes, "Wherefore, graci|ous King, remember your&s;elf, have pity on your &s;oul, and think that the day is even at hand, when you &s;hall give an account for your office, and of the blood that hath been &s;hed with your &s;word: In the which day that your grace may &s;tand &s;tedfa&s;t and have your <HI>quietus</HI> &s;ealed with the blood of our Saviour Chri&s;t, which will only &s;erve at that day, is my daily prayer, &amp;c."</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> PETER MARTYR.</HEAD>
<P>PETER MARTYR was &s;tiled <HI>de Vermiglio</HI> from the place of his nativity, in the territories of Florence, where he was born in 1500, and where his family had flouri&s;hed for &s;everal centuries with reputation. His parents were very &s;olicitous and careful about his edu|cation; and, being of a pregnant wit, and an ingenious di&s;po&s;ition, he gave great hopes, in his minority, of excelling in future times. He was very &s;tudious and a&s;&s;iduous, &s;pending no time idle. At &s;ixteen years of
<PB N="299" REF="324">age he entered into a mona&s;tery of regular canons of St. Augu&s;tine, in Fe&s;&s;ula, near Florence. There he &s;pent three years in the &s;tudy of the arts and the holy &s;criptures, part whereof he learned by heart. Then he went to Padua, where, entering into a mona&s;tery of the &s;ame order, he continued there al|mo&s;t eight years, in which time he almo&s;t wholly em|ployed him&s;elf in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy. There he heard the daily lectures of famous philo&s;ophers, who were profe&s;&s;ors in that univer&s;ity, as Branda, Genna, Confalionerius, &amp;c. and finding that Ari&s;totle was in many places not properly tran&s;lated into Latin, he re|&s;olved to &s;tudy the Greek language, which accordingly he did, with great labour, as he had not fit ma&s;ters to a&s;&s;i&s;t him therein: by which diligence he acquired &s;uch perfection, as to be able to read without help, and un|der&s;tand the Greek orators, philo&s;ophers, and poets. During his abode there, he likewi&s;e heard the con&s;tant lectures of three divines. When he was twenty-&s;ix years old, the fraternity of that mona&s;tery called him to the office of preaching, whereby he might put in practice his former private &s;tudies, be &s;erviceable to them, and make him&s;elf famous; and upon trial his learning and abilities appeared to be &s;uch, that he was honoured with the degree of a Doctor. He began fir&s;t to preach in the church of Brixia, and afterwards in the mo&s;t famous cities of Italy. All the time he could gain from preaching, he &s;pent in the &s;tudy of philo&s;o|phy and divinity. He preached al&s;o privately, and read lectures in the colleges of Padua, Ravenna, Bo|nonia, and Vercellis.</P>
<P>Hitherto he had mo&s;t applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of &s;chool-divinity, but now he began to &s;pend mo&s;t of his time in &s;earching the fountain, the Old and New Te&s;|tament; and finding, that, to enable him thereto, the knowledge of the Hebrew was very nece&s;&s;ary, whil&s;t he was Vicar to the Prior in Bononia, he applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of that language, and, by his &s;ingular di|ligence,
<PB N="300" REF="325">became a good proficient therein. His name grew very famous in the chief cities of Italy; and the &s;uperiors of his order, approving his diligence, re&s;olved to advance him to &s;ome greater dignity, and &s;o by the con&s;ent of all he was made Abbot of Spoleta. He behaved &s;o excellently in that &s;tation, that he was uni|ver&s;ally admired, con&s;idering that tho' hitherto he had been only employed in his &s;tudies, he yet &s;hewed &s;uch wi&s;dom and dexterity in managing the affairs of a mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>At Spoleta he continued three years: at the end whereof, by a public convention of the &s;uperiors of the order, he was made Governor of the college at Naples, which for the dignity of the place, and pro|fits belonging to it, was of great e&s;teem. In that city he attained to more light and knowledge of the truth than he formerly had: and by his &s;tudy of the &s;crip|tures ob&s;erved the errors and abu&s;es that had crept into the church; whereupon he began to read the works of &s;ome Prote&s;tant authors, by which he owned afterwards that he profited very much. He daily al&s;o conferred with &s;ome friends that were addicted to the &s;tudy of the reformed religion, to the mutual edification of both parties. A reformed church being gathered in Naples, Peter Martyr jointed him&s;elf to it; and being de&s;irous to in&s;truct others, he began to expound St. Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians with great &s;ucce&s;s; for not only the fellows of his college re&s;orted to him, but many Bi&s;hops and Noblemen. But when he came to the words of 1 Cor. iii. 13, 14. <HI>Every man's works &s;hall be made manife&s;t, for the day &s;hall declare it, becau&s;e it &s;hall be revealed by fire,</HI> &amp;c. and had interpreted them contrary to the received opinion, many adver&s;aries were &s;tirred up again&s;t him: for it was commonly thought, that the&s;e words imply a <HI>purgatory;</HI> but Dr. Martyr &s;hewed, out of the ancient fathers, that the&s;e words could not be &s;o under&s;tood. However the Popi&s;h clergy could by no means endure this interpretation; knowing
<PB N="301" REF="326">that if purgatory was overthrown, a great part of their profits by ma&s;&s;es, indulgences, &amp;c. would pre&s;ently cea&s;e. Whereupon they accu&s;ed Martyr, and &s;o far pre|vailed as to have his lecture put down: but Martyr refu&s;ed to obey the &s;entence as unju&s;t, and tru&s;ting to the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, appealed to the Pope; and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends at Rome he overcame his adver&s;aries: for at that time he had there potent friends, as Cardinal Gonzaga, Ga&s;par Contareni, Re|ginald Pole, Peter Bembus, and Frederic Frego&s;ius, all learned men, and gracious with the Pope, who al&s;o acknowledged that the church needed &s;ome re|formation. By their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he got the interdict taken off, and was re&s;tored to his former liberty of preaching, which yet he could not long enjoy; for before he had been three years at Naples, he fell into a grievous and dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, together with his old fellow &s;tudent Benedictus Cu&s;anus, who died: but Martyr, by the diligence of his phy&s;icians, was (tho' with great difficulty) cured. The &s;uperiors of his order, in a convention, &s;eeing that the air of Naples did not agree with him, made him general vi&s;itor of their order. In that office he &s;o demeaned him&s;elf, that good men much commended his integrity, con|&s;tancy and gravity; and others feared him, not daring to di&s;cover their hatred to him. Sometime afterwards, in a co$ve$tio$ of the &s;uperiors, he was made prior of the mona&s;tery $n Luc$a Some out of love preferred him to this place; others, thinking that it would prove his rum: for there was an ancient grudge between Florence and Lucca, the latter &s;u&s;pecting that the Florentines wanted to en&s;lave them. But Peter Mar|tyr, by his excellent learning and virtue, did &s;o prevail on $he people o$ Lucca, that, contrary to the expec|tation of his adver&s;aries, him&s;elf being a Florentine, he was no le&s;s $&s;teemed at Lucca, than if he had been $word$ among&s;t them: &s;o that they earne&s;tly de&s;ired the $up riors o$ his order, that he might not be removed

<PB N="301" REF="328">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="302" REF="329">from thence. Numbers of the nobility, and &s;enators of the city, re&s;orted to his lectures; and, that he might the better plant religion in that commonwealth, he preached to them every Sunday. What fruit his mini&s;try had, may be di&s;cerned by this, that in one year's &s;pace, after his departure out of Italy, eighteen fellows of that college left their places and po|pery, betaking them&s;elves to the reformed churches. Many citizens al&s;o of Lucca went into voluntary exile, where they might enjoy their opinions with peace and &s;afety. Whil&s;t Martyr remained at Lucca, there met at that city the Emperor Charles V. Pope Paul III. and Cardinal Contareni, coming legate out of Germany; who, for old acquaintance &s;ake, lodged with Martyr, and had daily much conference with him about religion. Mo&s;t people imagined that Martyr would be in no &s;mall danger, on account of the pre|&s;ence of the Pope; becau&s;e that his enemies might &s;ugge&s;t &s;omething to the &s;u&s;picious old Pontiff, which would turn to Martyr's great trouble. However, as he was &s;trengthened with his own authority and learn|ing, and a great place in the affections of the people, they moved not at that time; but waited for a fitter opportunity, intending to undermine him &s;ecretly. However, as a foreta&s;te of what they intended, they &s;eized upon a friar of Martyr's college, and impri&s;on|ed him, under the accu&s;ation of violating their reli|gion: but &s;ome noblemen re&s;cuing him, thereupon Martyr's enemies accu&s;ed him at Rome, and in all the colleges of his order, and &s;ummoned him to ap|pear at Geneva, to an&s;wer the &s;ame; but he, being informed of the &s;nares that were laid for him, and al&s;o being admoni&s;hed by his friends to take care of him&s;elf, for that many &s;ought his life, he re&s;olved not to go to the a&s;&s;embly, but to remove him&s;elf to &s;ome place, where he might be &s;afe from the power and malice of his adver&s;aries. He fir&s;t conveyed part of his library to Chri&s;topher Brent, a &s;enator of Lucca,
<PB N="303" REF="330">who, he knew, would take care and &s;end it to Germany to him; the other part of it he gave to the college: and, &s;etting all things in order in that hou&s;e, he pri|vately departed out of the city. Purpo&s;ing to vi&s;it his own country, he went to Pi&s;a; and meeting there with &s;ome tru&s;ty me&s;&s;engers, he wrote to Cardinal Pole, and &s;ome other of his friends at Lucca. Being arrived at Florence, he met there with a godly and learned man (Bernardin Ochine) who, being cited to Rome, was going thither; but, being warned of the danger by his friends, he con&s;ulted with Martyr, and, upon deliberation, both of them agreed to leave Italy, and retire into Germany.</P>
<P>Ochine departed fir&s;t, and went to Geneva, and from thence to Aug&s;burgh; and two days after Martyr followed, going fir&s;t to Bononia, then to Ferrara, and from that to Verona. Being courteou&s;ly enter|tained there by his old friends, he went thence over the Alps into Switzerland. In his journey, when he came to Zurich, he was very kindly entertained by Bullinger, Pellicane, and Gualter, and by the other mi|ni&s;ters belonging to that city, to whom he offered his &s;ervice if they needed it; but it was declined. From thence he went to Ba&s;il, where, after he had abode about a month, he was called to Stra&s;burgh, by the means of Martin Bucer; in which place he was made profe&s;&s;or of divinity. There he continued five years, in which time he interpreted mo&s;t part of the Bible, which he had a great &s;kill in. Finding &s;ome inconvenience of living &s;ingle, by the advice of his friends, he married an hone&s;t and noble virgin, Catherine Damp Martin, who afterwards died in England without i&s;&s;ue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 240 of this volums.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward VI. and the aboli&s;hing of the Papacy in England, it was re&s;olved to reform the univer&s;ities, that a proper mini&s;try &s;hould proceed therefrom; and Peter Martyr being at this time famous
<PB N="304" REF="331">for his learning and &s;kill in affairs, was judged a pro|per in&s;trument in that employment: whereupon the Archbi&s;hop, by the command of the King, &s;ent for him over; and, by the con&s;ent of the &s;enate of Stra&s;|burgh, he came over to England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 124 of this volume.</NOTE>. Cranmer, for &s;ome time, entertained him at his hou&s;e, with all courte&s;y and humanity, till the King &s;ent him to Oxford, to be profe&s;&s;or of divinity; where he fir&s;t began to ex|pound the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, becau&s;e there|in were many heads laid down, which concerned the controver&s;ies of the times. The Roman Catholics (whereof as yet there were many at Oxford) at fir&s;t patiently bore Martyr's teaching, frequented his lec|tures, and indeed &s;eemed to admire his learning: but &s;ome of them, e&s;pecially the heads of hou&s;es, laboured to re&s;train the &s;tudents from going to his lectures, but yet proceeded no farther. When he came to declare his judgment about the &s;acrament, they could bear it no longer; and therefore, that they might not only procure him envy, but danger, they fir&s;t began to ac|cu&s;e him of teaching contrary to the doctrine of their forefathers, of de&s;igning to extirpate their whole&s;ome and decent ceremonies, of profaning the &s;acrament of the altar, and (as it were) trampling it under his feet. Then (without acquainting him) they affixed papers upon all their church-doors, in Engli&s;h, declaring that to-morrow there &s;hould be a public di&s;putation, again&s;t the real pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the &s;acrament. By this means, the next day they &s;illed the &s;chools, di&s;po&s;ed their party in every place, commanding them to make a noi&s;e, to rai&s;e tumults, and, if need were, to fight with any that &s;hould oppo&s;e them. Many went, not only of the &s;cholars, but of the town&s;men, &s;ome to &s;ee the event of this bu&s;ine&s;s, others to a&s;&s;i&s;t their friends, in ca&s;e they &s;hould fall together by the ears. Martyr, in the mean time, being wholly ignorant of the affair,
<PB N="305" REF="332">was in his hou&s;e preparing him&s;elf in his u&s;ual manner to read his lecture, till &s;ome of his friends (ob&s;erving the unu&s;ual concour&s;e of people) went to him, and opening the bu&s;ine&s;s to him, would have per&s;uaded him not to go; but he rejected their advice, and in his way was met by Dr. Smith's boy, with a letter from his ma&s;ter, wherein he challenged him to a di&s;putation. On this, Martyr's friends again earne&s;tly &s;olicited him to return home; but he was &s;till re&s;olute; and &s;o going to the &s;chools, when his adver&s;aries provoked him, he endeavoured by a mode&s;t &s;peech to quiet them, &s;aying, that he refu&s;ed not to di&s;pute, but only di&s;liked the time, for that he came to read his lecture; and, having &s;omewhat quieted them, he went on with his lecture to the admiration of all. They, who before admired him for his &s;ingular learning and eloquence, now much more did &s;o for his con&s;tancy. For notwith&s;tanding the murmurs of the people, and the rage of his ad|ver&s;aries, he went on without the lea&s;t change of his colour, or he&s;itation of his voice, or trembling, or any thing that might imply the lea&s;t fear. Having ended his lecture, his adver&s;aries began again with great cla|mour to provoke him to a di&s;putation, nor would they accept of his mode&s;t excu&s;e, when he told them that he would di&s;pute at another time; that he was not now prepared, they having concealed their que&s;tions from him, without &s;etting them up in public as they u&s;ed to do. To this they replied, that he, who had read his lectures about the Lord's &s;upper, could not be unprovided to di&s;pute on the &s;ame &s;ubject. He an&s;wered, that he dur&s;t not undertake &s;uch a work with|out acquainting the King of it, e&s;pecially as the thing tended to &s;edition. He told them al&s;o, that to a law|ful di&s;putation it was requi&s;ite that the que&s;tion &s;hould be agreed on; that moderators &s;hould be appointed, by who&s;e judgment all things &s;hould be determined; and that they &s;hould have notaries to write the argu|ments on both &s;ides. Whereas, he &s;aid, none of the&s;e
<PB N="306" REF="333">things be ready, and the night draws on that we &s;hall want time to di&s;cu&s;s &s;o great a controver&s;y.</P>
<P>His adver&s;aries would not be &s;atisfied with the&s;e ju&s;t rea&s;ons, but all were like to fall together by the ears: whereupon the Vice-Chancellor interpo&s;ed his authority, requiring P. Martyr, and Dr. Smith, to meet at his hou&s;e, with their friends on both &s;ides, where they &s;hould agree upon the que&s;tions, and the time and or|der of di&s;puting. In the mean time, he commanded the beadles to di&s;&s;olve the a&s;&s;embly; and taking Mar|tyr by the hand, led him forth, and &s;afely conducted him to his own hou&s;e. At the time appointed, Martyr, accompanied with &s;ome of his friends, went to the Vice-Chancellor's hou&s;e, with Dr. Siddal, and Curtop, who were at that time zealous for the reformation, though afterwards in the reign of Queen Mary they de&s;erted it. Smith did the &s;ame, taking with him Dr. Cole and Oglethorpe, and three other Doctors of di|vinity. They contended &s;ome time about the laws of the di&s;putation; but at length the que&s;tions were agreed upon, and the time and place appointed for it. In the mean time, by their mutual con&s;ents, the King was made acquainted with it, that he might &s;end down his delegates, to order the di&s;putation aright. Smith, be|ing apprehen&s;ive on account of his rai&s;ing the former tumult, fled before the day came, fir&s;t into Scotland, and from thence to Louvain in Brabant. At the time appointed, the King's delegates came. In their pre|&s;ence Martyr di&s;puted four days, with three of the Popi&s;h Doctors, Tre&s;ham, Chad, and Morgan, where|in he &s;hewed excellent learning; and becau&s;e his adver|&s;aries &s;cattered abroad many fal&s;e reports, he afterwards printed the whole di&s;putation. The in&s;urrection hap|pening in Devon&s;hire and Oxford&s;hire<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 103 of this volume.</NOTE> &s;ome time after, many threatened the death of Martyr, &s;o that he could neither read his lectures, nor &s;afely remain in
<PB N="307" REF="334">Oxford; on which he was &s;afely conveyed by his friends to London, which the King was much plea&s;ed at; and when his wife and family could not with &s;afety re|main at his hou&s;e, his friends hid them, till the &s;editi|ous multitude were departed out of Oxford; and, after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion, Martyr returned again to his wonted labours. But his adver&s;aries often rai&s;ing tumults before his hou&s;e in the night, throwing &s;tones at his door, and breaking his windows, the King, to provide for his &s;afety, made him Dean of Chri&s;t's church, allotting him a fine hou&s;e, and plea&s;ant gar|den. He was much valued by his Maje&s;ty, and high|ly e&s;teemed by Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, and all that favoured the Reformation. Cranmer made great u&s;e of his advice in &s;ettling the government of the church: but in the beginning of Mary's reign, Martyr was forbidden the exerci&s;e of his place, and commanded not to &s;et a foot out of his own doors, nor to carry any thing thence. On this he wrote to his friends, &s;hewing what danger he was in, and plead|ing the public faith given to him when he was &s;ent for by King Edward VI. By this means he got leave to come to London; where it was di&s;puted in the coun|cil, whether he &s;hould be impri&s;oned; becau&s;e, &s;ome &s;aid, he had done much hurt to their religion: but af|ter debate it was concluded, that, as he came into England on the public faith, he &s;hould be &s;afely di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 193 of this volume.</NOTE>. Whereupon, &s;ending him public letters, &s;igned with the Queen's own hand, he went fir&s;t to Antwerp, from thence to Cologne, and thence to Stra&s;burgh, from whence he came: where he was entertained with much joy, by his old friends, and re|&s;tored to his former place.</P>
<P>Yet here he was per&s;ecuted by his enemies, who &s;ug|ge&s;ted to the &s;enate, that he differed in judgment from
<PB N="308" REF="335">the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burgh<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See vol. ii. page 128 of this work.</NOTE>, about Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence in the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, which might cau&s;e much trouble in the church, and that he refu&s;ed to &s;ign the articles of agreement between Luther and Bucer about this matter: whereupon Martyr wrote to the &s;enate, that there was nothing in that confe&s;&s;ion rightly under&s;tood which he did not concur with; and that if his text, at any time, &s;hould lead him to &s;peak of that &s;ubject, he would do it &s;o mode&s;tly, that it &s;hould give no offence; and that his not &s;ub&s;cribing to the agreement between Luther and Bucer (wherein, among&s;t other things, they had &s;et down, that they which wanted true faith did neverthele&s;s eat the body of Chri&s;t) ought not to be objected to him, for that he could not a&s;&s;ent thereto, but he mu&s;t give offence to the Helvetian, Engli&s;h, French, and Geneva churches: and that Bucer him&s;elf, in England, had taught far otherwi&s;e. With this an&s;wer the &s;enate was &s;atisfied; and he, and Zanchie, taught diligently both divinity and philo&s;ophy in that city: but &s;oon after Pellican dying at Zurich, the &s;enate there cho&s;e Martyr in his room, and pre&s;ently &s;ent for him, de&s;iring the &s;enate of Stra&s;burgh would con&s;ent to the removal: which they did, though very unwillingly; and Martyr em|bracing it the more readily, on account of the oppo&s;i|tion he &s;till met with at Stra&s;burgh, departed, to the great grief of his friends, in 1556, John Jewel (afterwards Bi&s;hop of Sarum) accompanying him.</P>
<P>There he was well entertained, by the &s;enate, &s;chools, mini&s;ters, and all good men. He re&s;ided for &s;ome time with his old friend Bullinger. The &s;enate, to &s;hew how greatly they e&s;teemed him, made him free of their commonwealth, that he might not live among them as a &s;tranger, but as a citizen. Here, by the advice of his friends, and to obtain i&s;&s;ue,
<PB N="309" REF="336">he married again, (&s;ix years after the death of his fir&s;t wife) one Catherine Marenda, who for religion had left her own country, and lived at Geneva in good repu|tation. As he was greatly valued by the people of Zurich, &s;o he loved them exceedingly. He was always ready to be &s;erviceable to other churches, as appeared in many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Soon after this, he fell &s;ick of a fever, made his will, and, to his friends that vi&s;ited him, he &s;pake chearfully and comfortably, telling them that his body was weak, but inwardly he enjoyed much peace and comfort. He made before them an excellent confe&s;|&s;ion of his faith, concluding thus, "This is my faith, and they that teach otherwi&s;e, to the withdrawing of men from God, God will de&s;troy them." He gave them his hand, and bidding them farewel, gave up the gho&s;t, A. D. 1562, aged &s;ixty-two years.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. THOMAS CRANMER.</HEAD>
<P>This renowned prelate, of whom &s;o frequent mention has been made in this work, was born on July 2, 1489, at Afracton, in Nortingham&s;hire, and was the &s;on of Thomas Cranmer, a gentleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a genteel fortune, and de&s;cended of a Norman family which came to England with William the Conqueror, and for &s;ome ages was &s;eated at Cranmer-hall in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. Young Cranmer was put to learn the grammar under a pari&s;h-clerk, with whom he &s;uffered much and improved little. At the age of fourteen he was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, where for eight years he &s;pent his time in reading, the &s;ubtilities and jargon of the &s;chola&s;tic writers. However, after|wards he applied him&s;elf clo&s;ely to the &s;tudy of the be&s;t Latin authors. He took his degree of ma&s;ter of arts, and was cho&s;en fellow of Je&s;us college. After that he married a wife in 1525, and thereby lo&s;ing his fellow|&s;hip, he was cho&s;en divinity-reader in Buckingham

From thence he was cho&s;en a fellow in Cardinal Wol&s;ey's college, in Oxford; but fore|&s;eeing the danger which afterwards followed, he refu|&s;ed that place. Whil&s;t he was in Cambridge, the di&s;|pute aro&s;e concerning King Henry's divorce, from his brother's widow, and the plague breaking forth at Cambridge, Dr. Cranmer retired to Waltham cro&s;s, where he propo&s;ed an expedient touching the divorce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 393 of vol. ii. of this work, where Dr. Cranmer is by mi&s;take called profe&s;&s;or at Oxford.</NOTE>, with which Henry was &s;o well plea&s;ed, that he ordered the Doctor to write his &s;entiments at large upon the &s;ubject: and commanded Thomas Earl of Wilt&s;hire, father of Anne Boleyn, to provide him with retired lodgings, books, and whatever el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary for the work. Henry made Cranmer one of his chap|lains, gave him a good benefice, and nominated him to the archdean$ry of Taunton. When Cranmer, in 1539, had fini&s;hed his ta&s;k enjoined by the King, he pre&s;ented it, &s;upported by the &s;criptures, and other authorities, to his Maje&s;ty; who, having read it, a&s;ked him whether he would ju&s;tify it before the Pope? and Cranmer profe&s;&s;ing his willingne&s;s, Henry ha&s;tened his di&s;patch to the Pope; and &s;ent other learned men abroad to foreign univer&s;ities, to di&s;pute the que&s;tion among&s;t the divines there; where it was concluded, that no &s;uch matrimony was lawful by the word of God. There Cranmer and the re&s;t proffered to de|fend, that, by the law of God, the brother ought not to marry the brother's wife; but none appearing again&s;t them, the Pope made Dr. Cranmer his penitentiary in England, Wales and Ireland, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. From thence Cranmer travelled, in 1531, to the Em|peror's court at Vienna, offering to di&s;pute with his divines upon the &s;ame &s;ubject: but the learned Cor|nelius Agrippa, coun&s;ellor to the Emperor, receiving,
<PB N="311" REF="340">in private conference, full &s;atisfaction from Cranmer, ea&s;ily per&s;uaded the other learned men that were in the Emperor's court not to contend with the Doctor, who, he &s;aid, was in the right; &s;o that no man con|tradicting him, Cranmer departed from the Emperor, and having travelled all over Germany, he brought home with him into England the opinions of the mo&s;t learned men that lived in the univer&s;ities, and courts of Princes. In this journey, he learned all the New Te&s;tament by heart; and was confirmed in his former opinion in favour of the Prote&s;tant doctrine.</P>
<P>William Warham, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, dying Augu&s;t 23, 1533, the King re&s;olved to &s;upply his place with Dr. Cranmer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 410 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>, who was then in Germany about the above-mentioned bu&s;ine&s;s, and was loth to take upon him an office of &s;uch great dignity in the church; for he knew that there was an oath to be taken to the Pope, before he could be in&s;ialled in that place; and he feared what i&s;&s;ue the King's divorce might have, not being ignorant of his violent di&s;po|&s;ition. He knew that &s;udden and great changes were dangerous, and that the court, to which he was un|accu&s;tomed, was full of deceits and intrigues; that he mu&s;t in all things obey the King's will, and that if he tripped in any the mo&s;t trivial affair, there would be &s;ome, who, envying his advancement, would take the advantage to tumble him headlong down. He al&s;o was now fallen in love with a young maid, O&s;iender's niece, whom he determined to marry, th$ugh he knew it was forbidden by law for a prie&s;t to marry, or for a man to be made a prie&s;t who had married a &s;econd wife. Weighing the&s;e things &s;eriou&s;ly within him&s;elf, when he was &s;ent for by the King to return home as &s;oon as he could, he &s;tayed in Germany &s;everal months, framing one excu&s;e or other, hoping that in the mean time &s;ome other might get the archbi&s;hopric: but
<PB N="312" REF="341">&s;uch were the times then that every man feared the &s;lipperine&s;s of the place, and declined it. At la&s;t Cranmer, having privately e&s;pou&s;ed his wife at Nu|remberg, returned home, and was con&s;ecrated Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury by John Langland Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, John Ve&s;ey Bi&s;hop of Exeter, and Henry Standi&s;h Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, on March 30, 1534: but previou&s;ly made a prote&s;tation again&s;t the u&s;ual oath to the Pope, which he was obliged to take; and when he gave the Pope's bull into the King's hand, &s;aid, "That he would never receive a bi&s;hopric of England, but from him who was the head of England, nor take an oath that was derogatory to the King's autho|rity." Thus being made Archbi&s;hop, he carried him|&s;elf as formerly he had done, ri&s;ing every morning at five o'clock to his &s;tudy; after dinner, if he had no &s;uitors, he &s;pent an hour at che&s;s, and &s;o to his &s;tudy again. He was naturally very charitable and gentle, &s;o ready to forgive and forget wrongs that it grew into a proverb, "Do my Lord of Canterbury a &s;hrewd turn, and he will be your friend as long as you live." He was &s;o free from pa&s;&s;ion, that he never mi&s;called the meane&s;t of his &s;ervants; he relieved many that were in want; was ju&s;t in paying all men; &s;o that when he was ca&s;t into pri&s;on, he owed no man a farthing. The whole weight of the reformation lay upon him: and it is with regret that we ob&s;erve his zeal's having hurried him beyond his u&s;ual moderation in the ca&s;e of Joan Boucher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 100 of this volume.</NOTE>. However, his charity was very exten&s;ive to the poor, for whom, being &s;ick, lame or wounded, &amp;c. he provided lodgings, and appointed an almoner, phy&s;ician, and &s;urgeon to attend them, and they had daily hot broth and meat &s;ent to them from the primate's kitchen. We have had frequent opportuni|ties of taking notice of the Archbi&s;hop's character in the cour&s;e of this work: and &s;hall now give an account
<PB N="313" REF="342">of his behaviour on the di&s;covery of an almo&s;t unpa|ralleled treachery and ingratitude, after the defeat of the la&s;t attempt again&s;t him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a full account of both the&s;e &s;chemes, pages 39 and 55 of this volume.</NOTE>, in the reign of Henry VIII. Dr. Cox Vicar-general, and Anthony Hu&s;&s;ey &s;ecretary, whom the King commi&s;&s;ioned to find out the authors of the plot again&s;t Cranmer, having loitered about Canterbury, without doing any thing to the pur|po&s;e, his Maje&s;ty &s;ecretly employed Dr. Lee to make &s;trict inquiry into the affair. Lee, going &s;peedily to Canterbury made him&s;elf acquainted with &s;ome per|&s;ons, by who&s;e directions he &s;earched the hou&s;es of &s;ome &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons by night, where he found let|ters written from Gardiner, which opened the whole plot again&s;t Cranmer. The&s;e he immediately carried to the King, who from that time withdrew his affec|tions from tho&s;e concerned in that affair, and acquainted Cranmer with the&s;e letters, bidding him beware of his enemies, now he knew them. Among&s;t the letters that were found in Kent, one was written by the &s;uffragan of Dover, another by Dr. Barber a civilian; which two men were well e&s;teemed by the Archbi&s;hop, and had been promoted, and greatly favoured, by him. When Cranmer had their letters, he &s;ent for them into his &s;tudy, and &s;aid to them, "You two are the men in whom I have always put mo&s;t confidence, and to whom I have always communicated all my &s;ecrets; you mu&s;t now give me &s;ome coun&s;el, for I am &s;hame|fully abu&s;ed by two whom I have tru&s;ted in the &s;ame manner; for the&s;e per&s;ons have not only di&s;clo&s;ed my &s;ecrets, but have taken upon them to accu&s;e me of he|re&s;y, and are become witne&s;&s;es again&s;t me: I require you therefore to give me faithful advice, how I mu&s;t behave my&s;elf towards them." Marry (an&s;wered Bar|ber) &s;uch villains and knaves de&s;erve to be hanged up immediately without further trial. Hanging is too good (&s;aid the &s;uffragan) and if there want an execu|tioner
<PB N="314" REF="343">I would be the hangman my&s;elf. At the&s;e words, the Archbi&s;hop, lifting up his hands and eves to hea|ven, &s;aid, "O Lord and mo&s;t merciful God, whom may a man tru&s;t in the&s;e days? It is true which is &s;aid, cur&s;ed be he that tru&s;ts in man, and makes fle&s;h his arm; there was never any man u&s;ed as I am: but thou, Lord, ha&s;t evermore defended me, and lent me one good ma&s;ter (meaning the King) without who&s;e protection I could not be &s;afe for one day; I prai&s;e thy holy name for it." Then he pulled the two letters out of his bo&s;om, and gave to them, a&s;king if they knew them? Upon which they fell down upon their knees, and a&s;ked forgivene&s;s with many tears. "Well (&s;aid the gentle Archbi&s;hop) God make you both good men, I never de&s;erved this at your hands: but a&s;k God forgivene&s;s, again&s;t whom you have highly of|fended."</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Elizabeth proclaimed.</NOTE> QUEEN Mary's death being com|municated by the privy council to the Lords lately a&s;&s;embled in parliament, it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to proclaim
<PB N="315" REF="344">the Prince&s;s Elizabeth. The majority of the peers were either altogether indifferent about religion, or &s;e|cretly favoured the reformation; and the re&s;t believed that the Popi&s;h religion was too firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, to be aboli&s;hed by a Prince&s;s who was no bigot, and had conformed, to the Romi&s;h religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 185 of this volume.</NOTE>. The Lords having deputed Nicholas Heath, Archbi&s;hop of York, to &s;ignify their re&s;olution to the Commons, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to proclaim the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, as next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, according to her fa|ther's appointment. Upon this Elizabeth was pro|claimed Queen of England, by &s;ound of trumpets, and loud acclamations, fir&s;t in the Palace-yard at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and then in London<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">She was then at Hatfield in Hertford&s;hire, and being addre&s;&s;ed by all the Bi&s;hops, then living, on their knees, at Highgate, in her way to London, &s;he allowed all of them, except Edmund Bonner, Bi&s;hop of London, to ki&s;s her hand.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Elizabeth was now but twenty-five years of age; but her natural abilities, the tran&s;actions of the late reign, and the difficulties &s;he had to deal with, had furni&s;hed and improved her beyond the expectations of her age: and of this early &s;ufficiency &s;he gave good proof in the choice of her council. She thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to intermix Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants at the board, that, by this means, neither party &s;hould de&s;pair of her favour, and the ballance would be be&s;t kept in her own hands. The Roman Catholic part were, Nicholas Heath Archbi&s;hop of York, William Pawlet Marquis of Winche&s;ter Lord Trea&s;urer, Henry Fitzalan Earl of Arundel, Francis Talbot Earl of Shrew&s;bury, Edward Stanley Earl of Derby, William Herbert Earl of Pembroke, Edward Lord Clinton Admiral, William Lord Howard of Effingham Lord Chamberlain, Sir Thomas Cheney, Sir William Petre, Sir John Ma&s;on, Sir Richard Sackville, and Dr. Ni|cholas Wotton, Dean of Canterbury. The&s;e were all
<PB N="316" REF="345">privy coun&s;ellors to the late Queen. The others of the reformed per&s;ua&s;ion (as Cambden reports) were, William Parr Marquis of Northampton, Francis Ru&s;&s;el Earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Parr, Sir Ed|ward Rogers, Sir Ambro&s;e Cave, Sir Francis Knolles, and Sir William Cecil: to which number, Sir Ni|cholas Bacon was &s;oon added. But that two of this la&s;t divi&s;ion, viz. Bedford and Cecil, conformed to the Roman Catholic religion in the late reign, may be ea&s;ily collected from their having a &s;hare in the public bu&s;ine&s;s. At her fir&s;t entering upon the govern|ment, &s;he &s;elected a &s;ort of cabinet-council from &s;ome of the Prote&s;tant party, and with the&s;e &s;he concerted mea&s;ures for retrieving the <HI>reformation;</HI> but this was to be done with great precaution, and gradual ad|vances. In the fir&s;t place, therefore, &s;he took care to &s;ettle the magi&s;tracy, and &s;ecure the kingdom from di&s;turbance: and to prevent confederacies and inva&s;ions from abroad, &s;he di&s;patched her amba&s;&s;adors to no|tify her acce&s;&s;ion to foreign Princes, and her de&s;ire to maintain their friend&s;hip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Karne, Queen Mary's agent at Rome, was in&s;truct|ed to inform Pope Paul IV. of the death of that Prince&s;s, and Eliza|beth's acce&s;&s;ion, together with her de&s;ire that there might be a mutual communication of good offices between them. Paul an&s;wered, "That the kingdom of England was held in fee of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee; that &s;he could not &s;ucceed, being illegitimate; that he could not con|tradict the declaration of Clement VII. and Paul III. that it was a great boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ume the name and government of it, without his con&s;ent: yet being de&s;irous to &s;hew a fatherly affection, if &s;he would rencunce her preten&s;ions, and refer her&s;elf wholly to his free di&s;po&s;ition, he would do what&s;oever might be done with the honour of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee," Elizabeth very little regarded the pontiff's remon&s;trance.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip of Spain &s;olicits, her in marriage.</NOTE> The King of Spain being informed of his Queen's death, ordered the Count of Feria, his amba&s;&s;ador at London, to addre&s;s Elizabeth for marriage, giving her an a&s;&s;urance of the Pope's di&s;pen&s;ation for that pur|po&s;e. Philip was not only willing to keep his Engli&s;h
<PB N="317" REF="346">title and intere&s;t, but apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the Briti&s;h do|minions &s;hould fall into a union with France by the Queen of Scotland's preten&s;ions. The Queen was un|re&s;olved in her an&s;wer for &s;ome time; an overture of this kind from &s;o great a Prince, and one who had formerly been very much her friend, was not &s;uddenly to be refu&s;ed. Whether Philip's former kindne&s;s pro|ceeded from real friend&s;hip or &s;tate-policy is not the que&s;tion; the favour was to be interpreted in the faire&s;t &s;en&s;e. The&s;e con&s;iderations kept the Queen-&s;ometime in &s;u&s;pen&s;e upon the overture. At la&s;t, looking farther into the con&s;equence, &s;he perceived that the marrying the wife's &s;i&s;ter was equally forbid|den, with entering into the &s;ame relation with the brother's wife; that, &s;uch an engagement &s;tanding condemned by the holy &s;criptures, the Pope's di&s;pen|&s;ation could never di&s;entangle the matter. Be&s;ides, by engaging with her &s;i&s;ter's hu&s;band, &s;he mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily own her&s;elf the i&s;&s;ue of an unlawful marriage, which &s;he might think &s;he had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, con&s;idering the public determinations both at home and abroad in favour of her father's divorce from Cathe|rine of Spain. However, &s;he returned King Philip's addre&s;s the &s;moothe&s;t refu&s;al, &s;hewing her&s;elf the ra|ther di&s;inclined to marriage, than denying it upon any other &s;core. But this Prince renewing his application by &s;everal letters, &s;eemed to have gained &s;ome ground in her affections, for &s;he made no &s;cruple to commend him for the re&s;ervedne&s;s and decency of his behaviour, &s;aying that &s;he &s;hould value her&s;elf in imitating his conduct. This di&s;cour&s;e made the Prote&s;tant courtiers apprehen&s;ive of an impre&s;&s;ion, and that the King might probably obtain her. Therefore, to prevent this alliance, they ventured to remon&s;trate loudly again&s;t the haughti|ne&s;s of the Spaniard: and &s;ome of her council, whom &s;he admitted to the highe&s;t confidence, told her, that her&s;elf, her friends, and the kingdom, were utterly ruined, if &s;he owned the papal authority, either in di&s;|pen&s;ing,
<PB N="318" REF="347">or any other matter; that two Popes had pronounced her mother's marriage unlawful; that up|on this &s;entence the Queen of Scots had put up her claim to the Engli&s;h crown; that the Pope would never rever&s;e this judgment of his predece&s;&s;ors; that it was in vain to expect ju&s;tice from the court of Rome, who had &s;hewn them&s;elves &s;o partial again&s;t her mother; and that the French King was now trying his utmo&s;t with that &s;ee, that Mary Queen of Scotland might be declared Sove|reign of England.</P>
<P>The Queen, having forthe&s;e rea&s;ons re&s;olved again&s;t the marriage,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Elizabeth intends re&s;toring the re|formation.</NOTE> believed that nothing would more effectually put a &s;top to Philip's importunity, than a &s;peedy alteration of religion. She therefore con&s;ulted her cabinet-council upon the proper mea|&s;ures for recovering the church to the condition it was left in by her brother King Edward. To proceed with the greater &s;ecurity, the danger of the enterpri&s;e, to|gether with the method for di&s;entangling the govern|ment, was laid before the board. The danger might be ranged under two heads, foreign and dome&s;tic. From abroad, her Maje&s;ty might expect, that the Pope would excommunicate her, and encourage an inva&s;ion. It was likewi&s;e not improbable that the French King might take his advantage of the opportunity, break off the treaty at Cambray, and &s;olicit the Queen of Scotland to make war upon England. Neither was it improbable but the Iri&s;h, being malecontents, and &s;o warmly attached to the church of Rome, might ri&s;e in rebellion: and la&s;tly, the King of Spain's great power, and neighbourhood in the Low Countries, was no fa|vourable circum&s;tance. The remedies in counterbalance were the&s;e; that as to the Pope's excommunication, it was only an in&s;ignificant noi&s;e, powder without ball, and was to be de&s;pi&s;ed; that the French, if they of|fered a peace, were to be clo&s;ed with; if not, it was thought worth while to court their friend&s;hip, as it
<PB N="319" REF="348">brought that of Scotland along with it. The Prote&s;|tants in France and Scotland were to be encouraged, and <HI>divi&s;ions in religion fomented.</HI> The garri&s;ons in Ber|wick, and upon the borders, were to be reinforced, and the &s;ame &s;ecurities provided in Ireland. A good cor|re&s;pondence with the Spaniards was to be pre&s;erved, and the old alliance with the hou&s;e of Burgundy re|newed.</P>
<P>The cabinet fore&s;aw, that the danger at home would ari&s;e from the nobility di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the council-board; from the Bi&s;hops and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who mu&s;t lo&s;e their preferments; from the Judges and Ju&s;tices of Peace, employed in the late reign; and, in &s;hort, from all hearty Papi&s;ts of wealth and di&s;tinction. The way to make tho&s;e people inoffen&s;ive, was to throw them out of commi&s;&s;ion, and to bring none but Prote&s;tants into the admini&s;tration; to purge the univer&s;ities; place new pre&s;idents in the colleges, and turn out the ma&s;ters at Winche&s;ter, Eaton, and other &s;chools. It was re&s;olved, that the Papi&s;ts mu&s;t not only be put out of bu&s;ine&s;s, but care mu&s;t be taken to &s;ink their cha|racter, and le&s;&s;en their intere&s;t, &s;o long as they continu|ed of that per&s;ua&s;ion: and if &s;ome of them &s;hould happen to comply with the alteration in the church, they were not to be tru&s;ted; it being natural for every man to watch his opportunity, to recover his old ground, and to like that e&s;tabli&s;hment be&s;t which him|&s;elf had a hand in &s;ettling: and particularly, as to the non-complying Bi&s;hops, they mu&s;t be reduced by &s;ome new parliamentary provi&s;ion: <HI>premunire</HI> mu&s;t be play|ed upon them; and when once they were in <HI>mi&s;ericor|dia</HI> they were not to be pardoned without entire &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and conformity; that by hampering them clo&s;e, and executing the laws &s;trictly, her Maje&s;ty's occa|&s;ions for money may be &s;omewhat &s;upplied: that tho&s;e Prote&s;tants who affected improper alterations, and were for throwing the eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity into a new form, ought to receive an early check: that it was by no
<PB N="320" REF="349">means advi&s;eable to allow more than one church: <HI>that the free exerci&s;e of different religions would prove an ever|la&s;ting principle of &s;edition and di&s;turbance,</HI> e&s;pecially in a nation of &s;o martial a genius as the Engli&s;h. How|ever, to prevent di&s;contents, the reformed <HI>liturgy</HI> ought to be reviewed, and made as inoffen&s;ive to all parties as may be: that this affair &s;hould be referred to Parker, Bill, May, Cox, Grindal, Whitehead, and Pilkington; the&s;e divines being all remarkable for learning and temper; and that Sir Thomas Smith, (who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have drawn this advice) was to bring them together, and have a &s;hare in the con&s;ulta|tion: that when the debate was &s;ettled, and the book fini&s;hed, it was to be pre&s;ented to the Queen, and, after her approbation, laid before the parliament; and that be&s;ides this committee, other per&s;ons of learning and character &s;hould have the peru&s;al of the book, to give it a farther reputation: that before the reviewed &s;er|vice was publi&s;hed, there mu&s;t be a &s;trict prohibition of all innovation: that frequent changes le&s;&s;ened the authority of a government, and therefore ought to be prevented as much as po&s;&s;ible; be&s;ides the giving out orders would &s;ugge&s;t an in&s;tance of duty to the &s;ubjects, and train them to the practice of obedience: and as to her Maje&s;ty, &s;he may keep to the &s;ame form of religion, unle&s;s with re&s;pect to the communion on high fe&s;tivals; at which time her Highne&s;s may re|ceive it with &s;uch a latitude of ceremonies, as &s;he &s;hall think fit: that where there are more prie&s;ts than one at ma&s;s, they may all communicate in both kinds: and for farther relief of her Highne&s;s's con&s;cience, if need be, the office of the ma&s;s may be the &s;eldomer read, and &s;ome other devout prayers u&s;ed in&s;tead of it: and la&s;tly, to the que&s;tion, what noblemen were to be made privy to this de&s;ign, before it was opened to the whole council? the an&s;wer was, that none but the Marquis of Northampton, the Earl of Bedford, the
<PB N="321" REF="350">Earl of Pembroke, Sir John Grey of Pyrgo, and Wil|liam Cecil, were to be tru&s;ted with the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>But the Queen having di&s;charged all tho&s;e commit|ted for religion in the late reign, and given the exiles leave to return home, the inclinations of the court were ea&s;ily di&s;covered. The Prote&s;tants pre&s;uming upon this knowledge, ventured beyond the protection of the con&s;titution; and meeting fir&s;t in private hou&s;es, and afterwards in churches, preached their per&s;ua&s;ion, and drew great audiences after them. The Papi&s;ts, on the other &s;ide, not dropping their defence, the peo|ple began to ruffle and grow warm in the controver&s;y: and thus images were pulled down in &s;everal churches, and the prie&s;ts affronted. The Queen, to keep the kingdom quiet, and prevent un&s;ea&s;onable &s;quabbling,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A proclama|tion forbid|ing preaching.</NOTE> publi&s;hed a proclamation for &s;ilencing the pulpit, and commanded all di&s;putes of this nature &s;hould be forborn: and thus, for &s;ome time, none were allowed to preach without a licence under the broad &s;eal. But to give &s;ome di&s;covery of what &s;he intended, &s;he allowed the liberty of reading the epi&s;tles and go&s;pels in Engli&s;h, provided it was done without expounding; the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the litany, might likewi&s;e be &s;aid in the &s;ame language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rainsford, a gentleman belonging to the court, petitioned Elizabeth, that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the four Evan|geli&s;ts, who had been long impri&s;oned in a Latin tran&s;lation, might walk abroad, as formerly, in the Engli&s;h tongue; but her Maje&s;ty replied, "That &s;he &s;hould fir&s;t endeavour to know the minds of the pri&s;oners, who perhaps de&s;ired no &s;uch liberty as he demanded."</NOTE>. As to the re&s;t of the &s;er|vice, it was to go on by the rubric of the mi&s;&s;als and breviaries, till the Queen and parliament had farther debated this matter.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559.] On January 13, the day before the coronation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen E|lizabeth crowned.</NOTE> there was a &s;plendid cavalcade from the Tower to We&s;tmin&s;ter. The Queen, before &s;he &s;tepped into her
<PB N="322" REF="351">coach, is &s;aid to have made a &s;hort ejaculation, heard by tho&s;e near her, returning God thanks for pre&s;erving her to &s;o happy a day: acknowledging her being re&s;cued by Providence from the extremity of danger, and comparing it with Daniel's deliverance from the den of lions. She was &s;aluted, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, with all imaginable marks of duty and affection: and her return to the&s;e acclamations was very engaging, both in air and ge&s;tures. The manner of her receiving an Engli&s;h Bible was particularly &s;triking: it was let down from one of the triumphal arches, at the Little Con|duit in Cheap&s;ide, and pre&s;ented by a figure re&s;embling Truth. When &s;he di&s;covered the pre&s;ent, &s;he fir&s;t ki&s;&s;ed her hands, and then receiving the book, ki&s;&s;ed it, laid it to her brea&s;t, promi&s;ed to read it, and re|turned the city more thanks for this pre&s;ent, than for all the re&s;t of great value &s;he had already received. It mu&s;t be owned &s;he was <HI>a great mi&s;tre&s;s of behaviour,</HI> and perfectly under&s;tood the art of making her&s;elf po|pular, without expence. Next day &s;he was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter, by Owen Oglethorpe, Bi&s;hop of Car|li&s;le: the &s;olemnity was performed according to anci|ent cu&s;tom, and directed by the Roman Pontifical. None but the Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le could be prevailed on to officiate at the coronation. Archbi&s;hop Heath, and the re&s;t of that order, declined that bu&s;ine&s;s. They were afraid that the impre&s;&s;ions of her Prote&s;tant edu|cation were not worn out: this &s;u&s;picion was confirmed by her late forbidding a Bi&s;hop to elevate the ho&s;t for adoration. Her permitting &s;ome of the church-&s;ervice in Engli&s;h was al&s;o much di&s;liked. However, the Queen appeared very religious, came con&s;tantly to the clo&s;et or chapel at the hours of prayer, and behaved her|&s;elf there with &s;eeming great devotion. She wore black in Lent, and was very attentive at the &s;ermon; tho' &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;he had rather addre&s;s God Almighty in prayer, and conver&s;e more immediately with him, than hear a learned and rhetorical di&s;cour&s;e upon the
<PB N="323" REF="352">divine attributes. She had honourable &s;entiments of the u&s;e of the cro&s;s, of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and of other &s;aints; and never mentioned them but with regard and reverence. The reader may po&s;&s;ibly be at a lo&s;s, why the Queen ri&s;qued her being refu&s;ed at the coronation, by &s;o many Bi&s;hops of the Roman per&s;ua&s;ion: for were not William Barlow, John Scory, and Miles Cover|dale, the Prote&s;tantt Bi&s;hops of Wells, Chiche&s;ter, and Exeter, living? Were not the&s;e three Prelates all hearty in the reformation? Why then was not the &s;et|ting the crown on her head offered to one of the&s;e? To this it may be an&s;wered, that the&s;e three Bi&s;hops were then actually deprived<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 193, 194, and 195 of this volume.</NOTE>; and the proce&s;s not being re|ver&s;ed, their character might be que&s;tionable. Be|&s;ides, &s;he had rea&s;on to believe the&s;e three Prelates would have &s;crupled the <HI>ceremoniale:</HI> and to have al|tered it to their approbation, might probably have drawn a blemi&s;h upon the &s;olemnity, and repre&s;ented her to di&s;advantage in foreign courts. And after all, it is po&s;&s;ible the form might &s;it ea&s;y enough upon her mind, and her con&s;cience give her leave to humour the junc|ture.</P>
<P>Upon Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, the Eng|li&s;h exiles at Geneva &s;eemed willing to make up the former difference with their brethren<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 228 of this volume.</NOTE>, and moved towards a reconciliation. To this purpo&s;e they di&s;|patched William Keth, one of their congregation, to the Engli&s;h at Arrow, Ba&s;il, Stra&s;burgh, Worms, Franckfort, &amp;c. In their letter to tho&s;e of Arrow and Franckfort, they expre&s;s a &s;trong inclination to recover a right under&s;tanding, and come up to a per|fect harmony with the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h: but then their propo&s;als were &s;omewhat narrow and reflecting; they called the ceremonies trifles, they propo&s;ed the be&s;t reformed churches, meaning Calvin's congrega|tion,
<PB N="324" REF="353">for the mea&s;ures of agreement. They were &s;en|&s;ible that cla&s;hing would di&s;&s;erve the reformation, and report them to di&s;advantage among the Papi&s;ts: and they would gladly have an end put to their former di&s;|putes; but then the accommodation mu&s;t be made up|on their own terms. This letter was &s;ub&s;cribed, in the name of the whole church, by Chri&s;topher Good|man, Miles Coverdale, John Knox, Anthony Gilby, William Whitingham, and &s;ix others. The Engli&s;h church at Franckfort, in their an&s;wer to this letter, de|clare them&s;elves plea&s;ed with this friendly overture, but are &s;orry it came no &s;ooner; for now, almo&s;t all tho&s;e of the congregation, with whom they conte&s;ted at Franckfort, were removed. However, they did not que&s;tion but that they would drop their re&s;entment, and look upon them as brethren. As for ceremonies, the &s;ettling of that point mu&s;t neither be referred to Franckfort nor Geneva: the divines in England, with the concurrence of parliament, mu&s;t put an end to that controver&s;y. They hoped the reformation would recover, and not be clogged with an overweight of ce|remonies: and therefore, provided nothing immoral was impo&s;ed, they were re&s;olved to acquie&s;ce in the public e&s;tabli&s;hment, and wi&s;h their brethren of Ge|neva may be equally re&s;igning. And &s;ince all the re|formed abroad differ in rites, and yet agree in doctrine, they &s;ee no rea&s;on why the Engli&s;h church may not be allowed the &s;ame latitude. However, if any ceremo|nies, really exceptionable, &s;hould happen to be put upon them, they promi&s;ed, at their return home, to join with them in an addre&s;s for removing &s;uch grie|vance. This letter was &s;igned, in the name of the church, by James Pilkington, Richard Bee&s;ley, Henry Knolles, Andrew Nowel, and &s;even others.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h at Geneva now returned home, ex|cepting a few that &s;tayed to fini&s;h <HI>their tran&s;lation of the Bible.</HI> They had already made a ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms, which they publi&s;hed by it&s;elf, and dedicated to the
<PB N="325" REF="354">Queen. On Jan. 25, the parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and Sir Nicholas Bacon, the Lord Keeper, opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, &s;ugge&s;ting to them what bu&s;ine&s;s they were to go upon, which was ranged under three heads; viz. religion, redre&s;&s;ing grievances, and reform|ing the admini&s;tration. As to religion, the Lord-Keeper acquainted the two hou&s;es, "That the honour of God Almighty was the Queen's principal concern: that this ought to have the preference in their debates: that religion was the fure&s;t ba&s;is for the &s;upport of the commonwealth: that the civil admini&s;tration ought to take its mea&s;ures from hence; and this world be go|verned upon views of the other. That di&s;charge of duty in this particular would derive &s;ucce&s;s upon all the re&s;t: but remi&s;&s;ne&s;s and negligence in that re&s;pect mu&s;t have an unfortunate eff$ct upon other provi&s;ions; for not being &s;ettled upon &s;trength and clearne&s;s of principle, they mu&s;t of cour&s;e be expo&s;ed to clearne&s;s and change; circum&s;tances which bring di&s;credit upon any public e&s;tabli&s;hment, and ought to be particularly avoided in matters of faith and religion. Her High|ne&s;s therefore (continues the Lord Keeper) earne&s;tly re|quires you, that, in regard to the duty you owe to God and her Maje&s;ty, the concern you have for your coun|try and your&s;elves, you would recollect your thoughts, and exert your endeavours: that you would &s;pare no pains for the e&s;tabli&s;hing that which&punc; after your utmo&s;t inquiry, &s;hall be judged mo&s;t &s;erviceable: and that, in the managing this debate, no con&s;ideration of &s;uperi|ority, power, intere&s;t, or plea&s;ure, no o&s;tentation of learning, nor conte&s;t for victory, may prevail upon you. And to this purpo&s;e her Maje&s;ty expects you &s;hould decline &s;quabbling, heat of di&s;putation, and &s;chola&s;tic arguing; as &s;uch niceties, and methods of contention, are below the dignity of the &s;ubject, and unbecoming a parliamentary a&s;&s;embly. Be&s;ides there is a great deal of time unnece&s;&s;arily &s;pent this way: and when men
<PB N="326" REF="355">harangue, and wrangle, to &s;hew their parts, they &s;el|dom agree in any &s;erviceable re&s;olves: and as your own debates ought to be governed by temper, gravity, and good humour, &s;o it is proper &s;ome public provi&s;ion &s;hould be made, to check contention, and contumelious behaviour <HI>without doors;</HI> and that no party-language, no terms of reproach, nor provoking di&s;tinctions, &s;hould be kept up in the kingdom. That the names of Here|tic, Schi&s;matic, Papi&s;t, and &s;uch like, &s;hould be laid a&s;ide and forgotten; for what do the&s;e di&s;criminations tend to, unle&s;s it be to perpetuate divi&s;ions, to en|courage factions, to inflame men's &s;pirits, and make them hate and do mi&s;chief to each other? In the management of this affair touching religion, two ex|tremes are to be carefully avoided; on the one hand, there mu&s;t be a guard again&s;t unlawful wor&s;hip and &s;uper&s;tition; and, on the other, things mu&s;t not be left in &s;uch a loo&s;e regulation, as to occa&s;ion indif|ferency in religion, and contempt of holy things. The exemplary puni&s;hment of undue wor&s;hip and &s;uper&s;ti|tion, and e&s;pecially of Athei&s;m and immorality, is clear from the hi&s;tory of all ages, and needs not be particularly recited: and the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence are no le&s;s remarkable on the contrary practice. And, for your farther encouragement, I think I may affirm, that neither good King Hezekiah, nor the noble Queen E&s;ther, had a &s;tronger zeal to di&s;charge error, and reform what's ami&s;s, than our Sovereign Lady has to recommend her&s;elf to the approbation of God Almighty. Let therefore the con&s;ideration of our duty to God, the terror of his judgments, the &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, the love to our country and our&s;elves, and the encouragement of &s;o inviting an example in the Queen, put us upon our be&s;t endeavours for pro|viding &s;uch laws, as may tend to the honour of God, the &s;ettlement of his church, and the repo&s;e of the kingdom." Thus clo&s;ed the Lord Keeper's &s;peech concerning religion.</P>
<PB N="327" REF="356">
<P>The convocation met the next day after the parlia|ment; and, after a ma&s;s of the Holy Gho&s;t, Bonner Bi&s;hop of London opened the meeting with a &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e; for, in the vacancy of the &s;ee of Canter|bury, the Bi&s;hop of London was commonly pre&s;ident of the convocation. But this po&s;t was not annexed to the &s;ee of London by common right, but by the choice of the dean and chapter of Canterbury. For in ca&s;e a convocation meets, when the &s;ee of Canterbury happens to be vacant, the prior and convent formerly, but &s;ince the reformation the dean and chapter, direct a commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome Bi&s;hop to repre&s;ent them; for being beneath an epi&s;copal character, they are un|qualified to pre&s;ide in per&s;on in the upper hou&s;e. They commonly make the Bi&s;hop of London their repre|&s;entative upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; notwith&s;tanding they have the liberty of pitching upon any other: and thus in the convocation held in the year 1532, when the &s;ee of Canterbury was void by the death of Arch|bi&s;hop Warham, the convent cho&s;e the Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph for their commi&s;&s;ioner; who upon the &s;trength of this repre&s;entation pre&s;ided in the convo|cation. Farther they are not tied to the nomination of a &s;ingle Bi&s;hop, but may join two or three in the in&s;trument for this purpo&s;e: and thus it happened at pre&s;ent, the Bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter and Coventry being joined with Bonner. This prelate told them, that notwith&s;tanding a Latin &s;ermon had been cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions, yet now it was not to be expected; becau&s;e the Queen had forbidden any &s;ermons in that church, till farther order from her Maje&s;ty. Nicholas Harpsfield, Doctor of Law, and Archdea$on of Can|terbury, was cho&s;en prolocutor. The only remarkable bu&s;ine&s;s done by this convocation was, the drawing up of certain articles in defence of the religion e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. This paper was couched by way of addre&s;s to the Bi&s;hops, who were to lay it before the Lords in parliament. The &s;ub&s;tance of it is as follows: They
<PB N="328" REF="357">acquaint the Bi&s;hops, that being informed by public fame, that many points of religion, hitherto unani|mou&s;ly received by the whole church, and handed down without interruption from the Apo&s;tles, were now called in que&s;tion, and particularly the articles underwritten; for this rea&s;on they thought them&s;elves concerned to provide in the be&s;t manner they could for the &s;alvation of them&s;elves, and the people com|mitted to their charge. Therefore being &s;upported with the precedent of their predece&s;&s;ors upon a re&s;em|bling occa&s;ion, they thought them&s;elves obliged to publi&s;h their belief of the following articles, appealing to God, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, for the &s;incerity of their declaration. Fir&s;t, "That, in the &s;acrament of the altar, by virtue of the words of con&s;ecration duly pronounced by the prie&s;t, the natural body and blood of Chri&s;t, conceived of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, are really pre&s;ent under the &s;pecies of bread and wine." Secondly, "That, after the con&s;ecration, the &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine does not remain, nor any other &s;ub&s;tance but that of God and man." Thirdly, "That the true or real body of Chri&s;t, and his real blood, is offered in the ma&s;s, as a propitiatory &s;acrifice for the quick and dead." Fourthly, "That the &s;upreme power of feeding and governing the church militant, and confirming their brethren, is given to the apo&s;tle St. Peter, and his lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, who repre&s;ent our Saviour for this purpo&s;e." Fifthly, "That an authority for debating and &s;ettling tho&s;e things which belong to faith, the &s;acraments, and di&s;cipline of the church, is a privilege which has always, and ought to belong to the hierarchy, and not to the laity; the Holy Spirit having given the for|mer a commi&s;&s;ion for the&s;e functions." The&s;e articles being put into Bi&s;hop Bonner's hands, were by him pre&s;ented to the Lord Keeper Bacon: and in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion Bonner acquainted the lower hou&s;e of convo|cation, that an in&s;trument was &s;ent up from both the
<PB N="329" REF="358">univer&s;ities, atte&s;ted by a public notary, in which the articles were all &s;ub&s;cribed excepting the la&s;t.</P>
<P>All the effect this declaration had with the hou&s;e of Lords and the Queen, was the bringing on a di&s;puta|tion between the Roman Catholics and the reformed.<NOTE PLACE="inter">A ai&s;putation be|tween the Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants at We&s;tmin&s;ter.</NOTE> This conference was begun, by the Queen's orders, on March 31, at the abbey-church of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The Archbi&s;hop of York, being one of the council, was required, in her Maje&s;ty's name, to intimate her plea&s;ure to &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops: and to make choice of eight, nine, or ten, of their own party, to manage a di&s;pute with an equal number of the other per&s;ua&s;ion. Archbi&s;hop Heath, and the other Bi&s;hops, con&s;ented to the motion, and the points propo&s;ed to be argued. Upon this, at the Queen's in&s;tance, it was mutually agreed, that, to prevent wrangling, the debate &s;hould be managed in writing: that the Bi&s;hops, as per&s;ons of the be&s;t qua|lity, &s;hould give in their papers in the fir&s;t place; and that the other party &s;hould return them their an&s;wer in writing the &s;ame day: and the papers which were mu|tually exchanged one day, &s;hould be reciprocally an|&s;wered another. And becau&s;e the i&s;&s;ue of this di&s;pute might give &s;ome mea&s;ures to the parliament, the Lords de&s;ired, that the papers might be penned in Engli&s;h: which was likewi&s;e agreed to by both parties. The preliminaries being all &s;ettled, the conference began at the time and place above-mentioned; the privy council, a great part of the nobility, and &s;ome of the hou&s;e of Commons, being pre&s;ent. The per&s;ons made choice of, to engage in the controver&s;y, were the&s;e; for the Roman Catholics, White Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, Bayn Bi&s;hop of Litchfield, Scot Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, Wat&s;on Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, Dr. Cole Dean of St. Paul's, Dr. Harpsfield Archdeacon of Canter|bury, Dr. Chad&s;ey Prebendary of St. Paul's, and Dr. Langdale Archdeacon of Lewis. Tho&s;e for the re|formation,
<PB N="330" REF="359">were Dr. Scory late Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, Dr. Cox late Dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter, Mr. Horn late Dean of Durham, Mr. Elmer late Archdeacon of Stow, Mr. Whitehead, Mr. Grindal, Mr Gue&s;t, and Mr. Jewel. The points to be argued were the&s;e, fir&s;t, "Whether it is again&s;t the word of God, and the cu&s;tom of the ancient church, to officiate and ad|mini&s;ter the &s;acraments in a language unknown to the people?" Secondly, "Whether every church has au|thority to appoint, to change, or &s;et a&s;ide, ceremo|nies, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical rit$s, provided the lame be done to edification?" Thirdly, "Whether it can be proved by the word of God, that there is offered in the ma&s;s a propitiatory &s;acrifice for the quick and the dead?" The Papi&s;ts were to defend the negative of the fir&s;t, and the affirmative of the la&s;t que&s;tion; and the Prote&s;tants were to make good the affirmation of the &s;econd. And that the di&s;putation might be managed in form, and the order ob&s;erved, the Lord Keeper took the chair; not that he had any commi&s;&s;ion from the Queen to determine between the parties, or over|rule any point in the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding things had been thus thoroughly adju&s;ted, the Bi&s;hops broke the method, and came unprovided with the paper, pretending they had mi&s;|taken the agreement. However, they &s;aid they were prepared to argue the fir&s;t propo&s;ition by word of mouth. The Lord Keeper, after a reprimand for de|parting from their preliminaries, gave them the liberty to proceed in their own way, they having promi&s;ed to put their arguments in writing afterwards, and deliver them to the other party. The Papi&s;ts having appointed Dr. Cole to repre&s;ent them, and deliver their &s;en&s;e upon the fir&s;t que&s;tion, he di&s;charged his commi&s;&s;ion &s;ometime by &s;peaking off hand, as it was pretended, &s;ometime by reading authorities out of a paper, and &s;ometimes he &s;poke what was prompted by his party. What he delivered does not appear; for it is plain his argument upon the fir&s;t que&s;tion, pre&s;erved in Bennet
<PB N="331" REF="360">college library, was not his fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, but a re|ply to Horn's paper. This is evident from Cole's &s;peech introductive to his argument: his words are the&s;e: "Whereas the&s;e men here pre&s;ent, have de|clared here openly, that it is repugnant and contrary to the word of God, to have the common prayers and mini&s;tration of the &s;acraments in Latin here in England; that all &s;uch common prayer and mi|ni&s;tration ought to be, and remain in the Engli&s;h tongue: Ye &s;hall under&s;tand, that, to prove this their a&s;&s;ertion, they have brought in as yet only one place of &s;cripture, taken out of St. Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, the fourteenth chapter, with certain other places of the holy doctors, whereunto an&s;wer is not now to be made. But when the book which they read &s;hall be delivered unto us, according to the appoint|ment made in that behalf, then, God willing, we &s;hall make an&s;wer, as well to the &s;cripture, as other te&s;ti|monies, alledged by them, &s;o all good men may evi|dently perceive and under&s;tand the &s;ame &s;cripture to be mi&s;con&s;trued, and perverted from the native and true &s;en&s;e." From hence he proceeds to reply to Horn's paper upon the fir&s;t que&s;tion. And here he a&s;&s;erts, fir&s;t, That divine &s;ervice, in an unknown tongue, is no contradiction to any plain declaration of &s;crip|ture; and, &s;econdly, &s;uppo&s;ing there were any plain text again&s;t this u&s;age, the con&s;tant practice of the church ought not to be condemned. This bold pro|po&s;ition he endeavours to make good by the following arguments. Fir&s;t, he takes notice, that notwith&s;tanding the keeping the Sabbath or Saturday was expre&s;sly com|manded by God Almighty, yet the church, without any warrant from written revelation, has changed the fe&s;tival to Sunday. That this alteration, having pa&s;&s;ed all along without &s;cruple or conte&s;t, is a good rea&s;on to rely on the authority of the church in other mat|ters. He ob&s;erves farther, that when our Saviour wa&s;hed his di&s;ciples feet, he told them it was "for their example, that they &s;hould do as he had done."
<PB N="332" REF="361">Notwith&s;tanding which expre&s;s words, the church had, without breach of duty, omitted the imitation. And in the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament of the altar, the practice of our Saviour, mentioned in &s;cripture, is not followed in every circum&s;tance; for he celebrated this my&s;tery after &s;upper. From hence he infers, that the church is governed by the devotion of the Holy Spirit; and that, in virtue of this privilege, &s;he is im|powered to change a cu&s;tom, even recommended by our Saviour him&s;elf; and that, by our Saviour's promi&s;e, the authority of the primitive is conveyed down to the pre&s;ent church. And upon this ground the church has barred the laity receiving under both kinds, and pronounced tho&s;e guilty of here&s;y who affirm that whole Chri&s;t is not contained under either &s;pecies. He reinforces his rea&s;oning from a text in the Acts, where the council of Jeru&s;alem publi&s;hed their decree in the&s;e words: "It &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to us, to lay on you no greater burthens than the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary things: that ye ab&s;tain from meat offered to idols, from blood, from things &s;trangled, and from fornication." Here is a plain precept from the Apo&s;tles, and other per&s;ons un|que&s;tionably in&s;pired, for ab&s;taining from eating blood, no le&s;s than from other things, which are unalterably unlawful; and yet this branch of the decree has not been kept; the church for many ages has di&s;pen&s;ed with the command; neither is &s;he blamed by the re|formed for indulging this latitude. To this he adds another in&s;tance, from the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, where it is &s;aid the Chri&s;tians &s;old their e&s;tates, lodged the purcha&s;e-money with the Apo&s;tles, and had all things common. But this charitable precedent was never thought binding to &s;ucceeding ages. From all the&s;e in|&s;tances his conclu&s;ion is, that &s;uppo&s;ing the Prote&s;tants had the &s;cripture on their &s;ide in the ca&s;e conte&s;ted, &s;uppo&s;ing this, which he won't grant, yet &s;ince the church is always under the guidance of the Holy Spi|rit, her deci&s;ions are no le&s;s to be regarded than tho&s;e
<PB N="333" REF="362">of the Apo&s;tles; that this a&s;&s;ertion is a plain con&s;e|quence of our Saviour's promi&s;e, "that the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould teach his di&s;ciples all things, and guide them into all truth; and that he him&s;elf would be with his church till the world's end." To this purpo&s;e he cites a pa&s;&s;age from St. Au&s;tin, where it is &s;aid, "that though the church tolerates a great many things, yet &s;he neither approves nor connives at, nor practi&s;es, any thing contrary to faith or moral duty."</P>
<P>After thus attempting to e&s;tabli&s;h the Catholic church in this extent of authority, his next effort is, to prove the &s;ee of Rome the &s;eat of this authority, and the cen|ter of unity: but for this he offers nothing but the te&s;timony of Irenaeus, where that church, or probably the city of Rome, is called <HI>potentior principalitas.</HI> From hence he proceeds to &s;hew the danger of &s;chi&s;m; that St. Paul conjures the Corinthians, "that they all &s;peak the &s;ame thing, and that there be no divi&s;ion among them:" that neither knowledge, faith, good works, nor martyrdom it&s;elf, will avail tho&s;e who are out of the communion of the church; for, as St. Au&s;tin &s;peaks, "let a man's preten&s;ions be what they will, whoever is &s;eparated from the church of Chri&s;t can be no Chri&s;tian." From hence Cole argues, that the tran&s;lating the common prayer into the mother-tongue is a breach upon the cu&s;tom of the univer&s;al church; and that &s;uch an alteration mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be intro|ductive of an horrible &s;chi&s;m. Then he endeavours to prove, that prayers in an unknown language has been all along the cu&s;tom of the we&s;tern church. And here, by a common mi&s;take, he makes Diony&s;ius the Areo|pagite the fir&s;t preacher of Chri&s;tianity in France: he mentions Martialis and Au&s;tin the monk, for the con|ver&s;ion of the Spaniards and Saxons; and takes &s;ome notice of the Britons and Germans being brought over to the belief of the go&s;pel: but when he comes to make out his point, that the &s;ervice was performed in the&s;e churches in a language unknown to the people, he of|fers
<PB N="334" REF="363">nothing but the &s;ilence of hi&s;torians. However, to give &s;omething of the face of an argument, he af|firms, the Prote&s;tants can never prove, that the church-&s;ervice in the vulgar tongue was generally practi&s;ed, either with re&s;pect to place or time. Then he proceeds to argue from the permanency of the Latin; that the phra&s;e and con&s;truction of this language keeps &s;teady and fixed, whereas that &s;poken by the common people is &s;trangely floating and uncertain, in&s;omuch that one age is &s;carcely intelligible to another: that if the church-liturgy &s;hould be always reformed to the modern &s;tyle, and changed as often as language wears, and words grow out of fa&s;hion, &s;uch frequent alterations would le&s;&s;en the veneration for holy things, &s;trike off the ad|vantage of antiquity, and di&s;&s;erve the maje&s;ty of reli|gion. He endeavours to &s;upport his rea&s;oning by ta|king notice, that the laity among the Jews were not permitted to enter either the holy of holies, or the body of the temple: and yet the prie&s;ts officiated in the fir&s;t, and the high prie&s;t in the latter: that, in the Greek church, the prie&s;t con&s;ecrates with the curtains drawn before the altar: that the people, by not un|der&s;tanding the public prayer, have a better opportu|nity for their own private devotion, which would be di&s;turbed, if they &s;hould do nothing but attend to an|&s;wer Amen: be&s;ides, that, in a great church, it is impo&s;&s;ible for every body to hear what the prie&s;t &s;ays. His next effort is &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing: he affirms, that if it were nece&s;&s;ary to officiate in the vulgar tongue, it would follow, that no body could be the better for any prayers, unle&s;s he under&s;tood them, and heard them when they were &s;aid: from whence the inference would be, that the church's prayers for St. Peter in pri&s;on &s;ignified nothing: each of which con&s;equences, as he argues, are no le&s;s than here&s;y. His la&s;t topic is from the ill tran&s;lation of the Bible. If we &s;hould, &s;ays he, con&s;ent to the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, we mu&s;t be obli|ged to u&s;e King Edward's common prayer-book, which
<PB N="335" REF="364">con&s;i&s;ts of ver&s;ions of P&s;alms, and other parts of the &s;cripture, in which are &s;everal plain mi&s;takes, and deviations from the original: and this, continues he, is downright depraving the holy &s;criptures; and if the liturgy mu&s;t be regulated upon this fal&s;e tran&s;lation, we may be &s;aid to &s;erve God with lies. We ought not therefore to alter the form of the common prayer to that degree as to lo&s;e the benefit of all devotion: and yet &s;uch mu&s;t be the i&s;&s;ue of this uncharitable conten|tion, unle&s;s our adver&s;aries think fit to acquie&s;ce. The church of God (as St. Paul &s;peaks) has no &s;uch cu&s;|tom as they would bring upon us; and therefore we may put the Apo&s;tle's que&s;tion to them, "What, came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?" Has the whole church of Chri&s;t been all along mi&s;taken, and never &s;een the fourteenth chapter of St. Paul to the Corinthians? Has the Holy Gho&s;t laid down his office, and di&s;continued his leading Chri&s;|tians into all truth, till now of late? St. Au&s;tin, in his letter to Julianus the Pelagian, who complained of hard u&s;age in the Ea&s;tern church, an&s;wers him thus: "In my opinion, father, you ought to have been de|termined by that part of the world in which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour crowned his chief apo&s;tle with martyrdom. You had your fir&s;t and &s;econd birth in the We&s;tern church. What makes you endeavour to bring in fo|reign doctrine upon her? or rather, why would you take away part of that faith you found in her at your bapti&s;m?"</P>
<P>Cole pretended, that it was in their power to cite a great many more authorities: however, he was willing to wave this advantage, for fear of being tedious to the audience. That this was Cole's &s;econd di&s;cour&s;e, for the reading whereof the Bi&s;hops in&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;trongly, at the &s;econd meeting of the conference, will appear farther by Horn's paper, the purport of which was as follows. He declares, by way of preface, a great regard for the authority of the Catholic church;
<PB N="336" REF="365">that they profe&s;&s;ed an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all the ar|ticles of the Apo&s;tolical, Nicene, and Athana&s;ian creeds; that they are willing to refer the whole con|trover&s;y to the holy &s;criptures and the Catholic church: but then by the Catholic church they do not under&s;tand the church of Rome, but that body of Chri&s;tians who can prove their title to Catholici&s;m from the &s;criptures, and is under the directions of the Holy Spirit; and that they have the warrant of St. Au&s;tin, and other fathers, to re&s;train the Catholic church to this notion. From hence he proceeds to &s;tate the que&s;tion, fir&s;t, that by the word of God, the Prote&s;|tants mean only the written word, or canonical &s;crip|tures; and, &s;econdly, by the cu&s;tom of the primitive church, they under&s;tand the general practice of the church for the fir&s;t five centuries. He fir&s;t undertakes to prove common prayer in an unknown language is contrary to the word of God. And upon this head he argues at length, and with &s;ufficient force, from 1 Cor. xiv. I &s;hall mention one text cited by Horn from that chapter: <HI>I will pray by the Spirit, and I will pray with the under&s;tanding al&s;o.</HI> From hence he argues that common prayer imports the joint petitions of the congregation, declared by their language; that this definition is approved by St. Au&s;tin. There would be no need of forming our prayers into words, &s;ays he, unle&s;s to di&s;cover the mind of the under&s;tanding to the people. The mini&s;tration of the Lord's &s;upper and bapti&s;m (adds Horn) are as it were &s;ermons upon the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t: but &s;ermons or repre&s;entations mu&s;t be made intelligible language, otherwi&s;e they are to no pur|po&s;e. It is not lawful for a Chri&s;tian to abu&s;e the gifts of God; and he that prays in an unknown lan|guage is guilty of this mi&s;management; for the u&s;e of &s;peech is only to communicate thoughts and di&s;cover the mind to the hearer. He fortifies his rea&s;oning from the practice of the Heathen, and the &s;ugge&s;tions
<PB N="337" REF="366">of natural light; and ob&s;erves that the Pagans in all countries, though never &s;o &s;lenderly improved, put-up their prayers to their deities, and perform their re|ligious &s;olemnities in the vulgar language. He then endeavours to prove, that prayers in an unknown tongue are contrary to the practice of the primitive church. He begins with Ju&s;tin Martyr's apology; where this father, giving an account of the Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip to the Roman Emperors, acquaints them, that, at their a&s;&s;emblies on Sundays, the writings of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets u&s;ed to be read; and that after &s;ermon they all &s;tood up and prayed; and that when the Bi&s;hop officiated in the communion-&s;ervice, the peo|ple all an&s;wered Amen. From hence it is evident, that the &s;criptures were read in the vulgar language; and that the liturgy was under&s;tood by the people, otherwi&s;e which way could they be qualified to &s;ay Amen. This cu&s;tom may be farther traced in St. Ba|&s;il's and St. Chry&s;o&s;tom's liturgies, where the people have a &s;hare in the &s;ervice. For in&s;tance, they an&s;wer, <HI>Lord have mercy upon us: and with thy &s;pirit: we lift them up unto the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> Now which way could they make the&s;e re&s;pon&s;es, or adju&s;t them to the time, un|le&s;s the public form was drawn up in the common language? Farther, St. Ba&s;il, in his letter to the clergy of Nea Cae&s;area, endeavours to take off &s;ome objections to the p&s;almody u&s;ed in his church; and having pre|mi&s;ed that their practice in this particular was uniform and general, takes notice that the people at church, after having made their confe&s;&s;ion to God, threw them|&s;elves into two divi&s;ions, and &s;ung the p&s;alms alter|nately. To the&s;e authorities he adds farther te&s;timo|nies, from St. Ambro&s;e on 1 Cor. xiv. from St. Je|rome on the&s;e words of the &s;ame chapter, <HI>How &s;hall be that occupies the room of the unlearned &s;ay Amen?</HI> To the&s;e the te&s;timony of Ju&s;tinian is &s;ubjoined, where the Emperor commands all Bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts to pronounce the liturgic prayers, and the office for bapti&s;m, with a
<PB N="338" REF="367">loud voice, that the people may hear, and be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their devotions: which benefit they cannot have, unle&s;s they under&s;tand what is &s;aid. And here he founds him&s;elf upon the Apo&s;tles rea&s;oning, and argues from the xivth of the Corinthians already mentioned.</P>
<P>When Horn had read through his paper, the au|dience &s;eemed to di&s;cover their &s;atisfaction, and give a preference to his arguments: upon which the Bi&s;hops alledged, that they had more to offer upon the fir&s;t que&s;tion. This was contradicting their former an&s;wer; for when Cole had ended his fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, the privy council a&s;king them if they had any thing to &s;ay farther upon that head, they an&s;wered no. Notwith|&s;tanding, to take off all pretences of complaint, the conference was adjourned till Monday following, and the Bi&s;hops were ordered to bring in their paper to the &s;econd propo&s;ition, with a promi&s;e that what they had farther prepared on the fir&s;t que&s;tion &s;hould likewi&s;e be heard: and to this both parties agreed. But when the day came, the Bi&s;hops in&s;i&s;ting upon their reading the &s;upplemental paper to the fir&s;t que&s;tion, and refu|&s;ing to abide by the la&s;t compromi&s;e, the conference, after &s;ome &s;quabble, broke up. White and Wat&s;on, Bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Lincoln, &s;hewing more heat than the re&s;t, and mi&s;behaving them&s;elves to a great degree, were committed to the Tower, and fined. The re&s;t were bound in a recognizance, to appear before the council, where mo&s;t of them were deeply fined.</P>
<P>As the reformed divines kept clo&s;e to the conditions of the conference, and came off with advantage upon the fir&s;t que&s;tion, &s;o they were no le&s;s prepared for the &s;econd, which they, in their paper, handled in a ma&s;terly and convincing manner</P>
<P>Let us now go back to the &s;enate<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 325 of this volume.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Further proceed|ings in parlia|ment.</NOTE> and con&s;ider the proceedings there in re|gard to eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. As to the Lords Spiritual, none of them had &s;um|mons but &s;uch as acted in the late reign. The fir&s;t bill was
<PB N="339" REF="368">for the re&s;titution of tenths, fir&s;t-fruits, and par&s;on|ages impropriate to the crown, which Mary had re|turned to the church. This bill, as a motive to make it pa&s;s, &s;ets forth the innumerable and ine&s;timable charges of the royal e&s;tate; "that the crown de&s;cend|ed to her Maje&s;ty very much incumbered, and le&s;&s;en|ed in the revenues; and that the &s;tatute of the &s;econd and third of Philip and Mary for the extingui&s;hing tenths, &amp;c. was made to the great di&s;heri&s;on and de|cay of the e&s;tate royal." From this preamble the &s;tatute goes on to repeal the &s;econd and third of Philip and Mary, cap. 4; and thus the acts for the payment of tenths, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of King Henry VIII. were revived. The Bi&s;hops all prote&s;ted again&s;t this reannexing the tenths, &amp;c. to the crown; but the temporal Lords voted for the bill <HI>nemine contradicente:</HI> which was &s;omewhat &s;trange, con&s;idering they were, almo&s;t all of them, the &s;ame members which made the act for returning the&s;e things to the church in the late reign. The Queen, de&s;irous of &s;haring the &s;poils of the church, yet affecting to appear &s;crupulous of re|taining the impropriations ve&s;ted in the crown, obtain|ed an act impowering her, on the vacancy of any bi&s;hopric, to re&s;ume the manors and temporal po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions thereof, making the &s;ee a ju&s;t recompence in par&s;onages impropriate: it did not pa&s;s the Commons without oppo&s;ition, though carried, on a divi&s;ion, by 134 again&s;t 90 voices. All the &s;ees in England and Wales (except Landaff) were either at this time actually vacant, or became &s;o before the end of the year: and whoever looks into the re&s;titution of temporalities, publi&s;hed by Rymer, will &s;ee how &s;hame|fully this power was abu&s;ed, to the &s;tripping them of all their be&s;t manors, under colour of giving them an equi|valent in impropriations, but in &s;o little a proportion to the real value of the other, that a church-bargain came to be an adage of the &s;ame import as Glaucus's exchange. The bi&s;hopric of Durham was at fir&s;t
<PB N="340" REF="369">treated as ill as the re&s;t, and, be&s;ides being charged with a pen&s;ion of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year towards the mainte|nance of the garri&s;on of Berwick (which was paid all her reign) &s;he &s;eized mo&s;t of the manors belonging to it, and retained them in her own hands: but this oc|ca&s;ioned &s;o general a di&s;content, and &s;uch heavy clamours among the gentlemen and yeomen, who held their lands by much more ea&s;y and advantageous tenures under the Bi&s;hops, than they could expect to do un|der the crown, that &s;he was afraid of an in&s;urrection, and re&s;tored them all to the &s;ee, except the great manor of Sedberg in Northumberland. In vain did the Bi&s;hops repre&s;ent to her the ill con&s;equences which this improveri&s;hment of the &s;ees would produce with regard to learning and ho&s;pitality, the &s;candal it would give abroad, the hurt it would do to her own character, and the di&s;credit it would bring on her re|formation. Elizabeth regarded no remon&s;trances: and, hot content with plundering them for her own profit, &s;uffered her courtiers to have a &s;hare in the prey; Sir W Cecil getting into his hands the be&s;t manors in the Soake of Peterborough; Sir Robert Dudley tho&s;e of the &s;ee of Oxford, and other favourites tho&s;e belong|ing to Bri&s;tol, and the re&s;t of the late erected bi&s;hopries. Another power granted her by this parliament, of making rules and &s;tatutes for the cathedral and col|legiate churches, &s;chools, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical corpora|tions, founded by her father, brother, and &s;i&s;ter, was more rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, and more careful in its exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The two mo&s;t material acts which pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, were, <HI>one for re&s;toring to the crown its ancient juri&s;diction over the &s;tate eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;piritual, and aboli&s;hing all foreign powers repugnant to the &s;ame;</HI> and another for e&s;tabli&s;hing an <HI>uniformity in divine &s;ervice, and in the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments.</HI> It had been declared by an act in the &s;econd parliament of Queen Mary, "to have always been the law of the realm, that the
<PB N="341" REF="370">regal office, with all the dignities, prerogatives, au|thorities, and juri&s;dictions, thereto belonging, whether inve&s;ted in male or female, were equally and entirely &s;o inve&s;ted in the one and the other; &s;o that, whatever a King might do or execute by law, a Queen (being &s;upreme governe&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and inheritor of the crown) might do by the &s;ame power to all intents and purpo&s;es whatever." In pur&s;uance of this declaratory &s;tatute, Queen Elizabeth a&s;&s;umed the <HI>&s;upremacy,</HI> not by the title of <HI>head</HI> of the church, le&s;t it might give offence, but by that of <HI>Supreme Governe&s;s:</HI> and to prevent all mi&s;con&s;truction in this point, declared to all her &s;ubjects in the injunctions, which &s;he publi&s;hed &s;oon after, "That nothing was or could be meant or intended by the fir&s;t of the acts above mentioned, than what was acknowledged to be due to her late father and brother; and that &s;he neither did nor &s;hould claim it by any other authority, than was claimed and exerci&s;ed by them, and was of antient time due to the imperial crown of this realm, <HI>i. e.</HI> to have under God the &s;ove|reignty and rule over all per&s;ons within her dominions, of what e&s;tate &s;oever, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tical or tem|poral, &s;o as no foreign power &s;hould have any &s;uperio|rity over them."</P>
<P>This not &s;erving to remove the cavils of unrea&s;onable men, the Bi&s;hops and clergy a&s;&s;embled in convocation, A. D. 1562, by her con&s;ent and authority, declared &s;till more explicitly, "That they did not by this act, or otherwi&s;e, give the Queen the mini&s;tring of God's word, or &s;acraments, but only that prerogative, which had been always given to all godly Princes in holy &s;cripture by God him&s;elf, viz. that they &s;hould rule all e&s;tates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tical or temporal, and re&s;train, with the civil &s;word, the &s;tubborn and evil doers." In this &s;en&s;e was the oath of &s;upremacy now enjoined to be taken, "acknowledging the Queen to be the only &s;upreme governe&s;s of all her dominions, in all
<PB N="342" REF="371">eccle&s;ia&s;tical and temporal cau&s;es, declaring that no foreign Prince, prelate, &s;tate, or potentate, hath or ought to have any &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction within this realm, renouncing all &s;uch foreign juri&s;|diction and authority, and promi&s;ing as well to bear true allegiance to her Maje&s;ty, as to defend all juri&s;|dictions and authorities belonging to her, or annexed to the imperial crown of England." All prelates and eccle&s;ia&s;tical mini&s;ters, all judges, ju&s;tices, magi&s;trates, officers, and per&s;ons receiving fee or wages of the crown, were obliged to take this oath, on pain of being deprived of their dignities, benefices, and offices, and rendered incapable of receiving any other: and it was to be tendered to all that &s;ued out livery of their lands, or did homage to the Queen, that took holy orders, and were admitted to degrees in the univer|&s;ities. The act repealing all the &s;tatutes of Queen Mary in favour either of the papacy, or of per&s;ecution for what was called here&s;y, and reviving all the acts of Henry VIII. again&s;t the papal power, and tho&s;e of Edward VI. in behalf of the reformation, inflicted &s;evere penalties on all that &s;hould, by writing, preach|ing, printing, word, or deed, maintain the &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction and authority of any fo|reign prelate or potentate within the Queen's domi|nions; the fir&s;t offence to be puni&s;hable with the for|feiture of all preferments, and goods real or per&s;onal, the &s;econd with the pains of a premunire, and the third with tho&s;e of high trea&s;on. Her Maje&s;ty was likewi&s;e impowered to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners for the exerci&s;e of her &s;upremacy, and for correcting all errors, &s;chi&s;ms, here&s;ies, and enormities: but they were "re|&s;trained from adjudging any thing to be here&s;y, but what had been &s;o determined by the authority of the canonical &s;criptures, by any of the four fir&s;t general councils, or by &s;ome other general council, founding its declaration on the expre&s;s and plain words of &s;crip|ture, or what &s;hould be hereafter judged to be here&s;y
<PB N="343" REF="372">by the parliament, with the a&s;&s;ent of the clergy in convocation." Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of this act of &s;upremacy, which laid the foundation as well of the <HI>high commi&s;&s;ion</HI> court, which &s;erved for a bulwark of defence to the church of England again&s;t the practice and attacks of both Papi&s;ts and Puritans, during the four&s;core years it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, as of that commi&s;&s;ion, which the Queen i&s;&s;ued this year, for a general vi&s;ita|tion, and for correcting all di&s;orders and irregulari|ties, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, which could not be re|dre&s;&s;ed by the ordinary epi&s;copal power, at lea&s;t with|out taking up more time than the exigencies of the church could well allow. As to the act of uniformity, e&s;tabli&s;hing the book of common prayer and admini|&s;tration of the &s;acraments, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that this book was the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance with that of the 5th and 6th of Edward VI. and only varied from it in two or three points, for the better promiting of a general conformity, a matter of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence to the peace of the nation and the &s;ervice of religion. It was with this view that the prayer for "being delivered from the tyranny, and all the de|te&s;table enormities of the Bi&s;hop of Rome," was left out of the litany, left it &s;hould &s;hock, and keep the Roman Catholics from joing in the public &s;ervice; to the matter whereof they could not otherwi&s;e have any exception: and in fact, they re&s;orted generally to the pari&s;h churches for ten years, till that famous bull of Pope Pius V. was publi&s;hed; as is affirmed of his own knowledge by Sir E. Coke, in his &s;peech at Norwich a&s;&s;izes, and by Queen Elizabeth, in a letter, on Augu&s;t 11, 1570, to Sir Francis Wal&s;ing|ham, during his emba&s;&s;y at Paris, and confirmed even by Saunders and Garnet. The different explications of the particular manner of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence in the eu|chari&s;t, given in the <HI>Augsburg</HI> and <HI>Helvetic confe&s;&s;ions,</HI> had given occa&s;ion to unhappy di&s;putes, which had been carried to a &s;trange height, and done great di&s;|&s;ervice
<PB N="344" REF="373">to the reformation; though the learned and moderate men on both &s;ides found, that they agreed in the main when they came to explain their &s;enti|ments. To reconcile &s;uch as had a regard for tho&s;e foreign churches, to the liturgy, the revi&s;ors of it added the benediction at the delivery of the &s;acred elements, pre&s;cribed by King Edward's fir&s;t liturgy, to that which had been adopted at the in&s;tance of the Calvini&s;is in the &s;econd; thus taking care, whil&s;t they rejected a carnal, that they &s;hould maintain in general &s;uch a real pre&s;ence, as is a&s;&s;erted in the writings of the ancient fathers.</P>
<P>This la&s;t mentioned bill did not pa&s;s the Lords with|out &s;ome &s;truggle. Cuthbert Scot, Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, and John Fecknam abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter, harangued again&s;t it: and as their &s;peeches are the la&s;t which there will be occa&s;ion to mention on the &s;ubject, and &s;eem to comprehend all the arguments, which the Papi&s;ts could adduce in favour of this cau&s;e, we &s;hall, with our u&s;ual impartiality, pre&s;ent them to our readers. Fecknam &s;poke as follows&mdash;As two different views were the &s;ubject of their inquiry, he looked upon it as a point of the la&s;t importance to re&s;olve on the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion: that he conceived him&s;elf bound in duty to God, the Queen, and their Lord&s;hips, to deliver his opinion upon the ca&s;e; and, in order to &s;et their Lord&s;hips upon a &s;ure bottom, he lays down three rules to form their judgment upon. Fir&s;t, To di&s;tingui&s;h the true religion from what is counterfeit, we mu&s;t con&s;ider which of them has the be&s;t claim to antiquity, and has been mo&s;t univer&s;ally received both as to time and place. Secondly, Which of them has been mo&s;t con&s;tant and uniform with it&s;elf. Thirdly, Whether of the two religions is mo&s;t productive of mo|rality and virtue: and in which communion the people are mo&s;t exemplary for their piety towards God, and their obedience to the civil magi&s;trate. In treating of the fir&s;t point, the abbot pretended that the reformed
<PB N="345" REF="374">religion was altogether modern and novel, and never received till the latter end of Edward VI. Whereas the Roman Catholic faith and wor&s;hip profe&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent in this realm, had been the religion of the i&s;land for no le&s;s than fourteen hundred years. He takes it for granted, that the articles and wor&s;hip of the Chri&s;tian religion, when fir&s;t planted here, were the &s;ame with the pre&s;ent belief and practice of the church of Rome; and that all parts of chri&s;tendom were agreed about the&s;e matters. As to the &s;econd rule, he charges the new religion, &s;et forth in the articles, and liturgic books of the Engli&s;h reformers, with in|con&s;i&s;tency and different appearance. He alledges, that the&s;e reformers floated in their opinion, quitted their fir&s;t plan, and refined upon them&s;elves; and yet always pretended to publi&s;h and decree nothing but the &s;incere word of God. He &s;ays, that it was no wonder to find &s;uch diver&s;ity in the religious &s;y&s;tem of the reformed, &s;ince the men that compo&s;ed it could neither agree with each other, nor with them&s;elves. To make out this charge, he pretends, that our Engli&s;h reformers took their mea&s;ures, and were go|verned in their re&s;olutions, by the divines of Germany, &s;uch as Carolo&s;tedius, Melancthon, Luther, and Zuin|glius. He gives an in&s;tance of their di&s;agreement, concerning the doctrine of the holy euchari&s;t. Carolo&s;|tedius interprets the words of the in&s;titution of the holy euchari&s;t thus, <HI>accepit panem, benedixit, fregit, deditque di&s;cipulis &s;uis, dicens, Accipite, et comedite, hoc e&s;t corpus meum quod pro vobis tradetur, mon&s;trans corpus vi&s;ibile &s;uum.</HI> i. e. according to Carolo&s;tedius's divinity, our Saviour pointed to his vi&s;ible body, and &s;aid, "This is my body which &s;hall be betrayed for you." This expo&s;ition was condemned by Luther, who expounded the words of the in&s;titution to a &s;en&s;e of con&s;ub&s;tan|tiation. Zuinglius makes the words <HI>my body,</HI> &s;ignify no more than the figure of my body. Peter Martyr, in his late di&s;putations at Oxford, differed from the&s;e
<PB N="346" REF="375">three, and would have us to under&s;tand by <HI>this is my body,</HI> that our Saviour's body received by faith, &s;hall be <HI>pro pane, vel in&s;tar panis,</HI> i. e. in&s;tead of bread to the communicants. The abbot then proceeds to charge Archbi&s;hop Cranmer with &s;elf contradiction, and fluc|tuating in his belief. His in&s;tance is, that in one year he publi&s;hed a catechi&s;m in Engli&s;h, and dedicated it to King Edward VI. in which he a&s;&s;erts the real pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t's body in the euchari&s;t; but &s;oon after he printed another book, in which he plainly main|tained the contrary doctrine. From hence he infers, that &s;ince both the Engli&s;h and German reformers are &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, their Lord&s;hips have great rea&s;on to que&s;tion their belief, and refu&s;e their &s;cheme till they are better agreed. The abbot then comes to his third rule or characteri&s;tic of the true re|ligion, i. e. Whether the Roman Catholic or the Re|formed communion affords the be&s;t people, with re|&s;pect to piety and civil life? And here he is &s;o hardy as to appeal to matter of fact, and de&s;ire their Lord|&s;hips to con&s;ider how much the &s;ubject is changed for the wor&s;e, &s;ince the death of Queen Mary: which declen&s;ion in virtue he lays to the charge of the new preachers. In her late Maje&s;ty's reign (&s;aith he) your Lord&s;hips may remember how quiet and governable the people were; it was not then their cu&s;tom to pre&s;cribe to authority, to run before the laws, nor di&s;obey the proclamations of their &s;overeign. There was then no &s;acrilegious rapine, no plundering of churches, no bla&s;phemous outrage, and trampling the holy &s;acraments under their $eet. In the late reign, the generality of the people, and particularly the nobility and tho&s;e of the privy council, were ex|amplary for their public devotion: it being the cu&s;|tom to go to a church or chapel, to beg the protec|tion of God, before they entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. But now the face of things is quite otherwi&s;e. The new preachers, and the &s;tage, by
<PB N="347" REF="376">rallying and running down the old religion, have rai&s;ed a turbulent humour in the people, brought on a di&s;&s;o|lution of manners, and a contempt of religious appoint|ments. From this declen&s;ion in piety and good man|ners (which he takes for granted) he &s;olicits the Lords to expel the reformation, and adhere to the antient belief."</P>
<P>Fecknam, to remark nothing farther on his &s;peech, mi&s;reports Cranmer and Ridley on the &s;ubject of the holy euchari&s;t; for neither of the&s;e Bi&s;hops had contradicted their &s;entiments in King Edward's reign. No, they explained them&s;elves con&s;i&s;tently, and refuted the calumnies thrown upon them.</P>
<P>At the third reading of the bill, Cuthbert Scot, Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, delivered him&s;elf again&s;t it in a &s;et &s;peech.</P>
<P>"My Lords, this bill, though it has been thrice read, yet in my opinion it ought neither to have been mentioned nor regarded in this honourable hou&s;e, the de&s;ign of it being to expo&s;e tho&s;e things to que&s;tion, which ought to be received without farther enquiry. To &s;peak particularly, the bu&s;ine&s;s of this bill is to bring on a change in religion, or more properly a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of what has been antiently profe&s;&s;ed. As to religion, it con&s;i&s;ts partly in externals, and partly of things which relate to the &s;ubject, and are e&s;&s;ential to practice. As for tho&s;e matters which are more e&s;&s;en|tial, they may be reduced to faith, hope, and charity; and touching the externals, the liturgy, and the ad|mini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, may be ranged under this head. Now, with reference to the&s;e latter, they are clearly &s;unk and extingui&s;hed by this bill; and as for the former, the efficacy of them is much weakened. For, fir&s;t, by breaking the unity of the church, charity is lo&s;t; for <HI>nunquam relinquent unitatem, qui non prius amittunt charitatem,</HI> i. e. "they never for&s;ake unity, who do not fir&s;t love charity." And St. Paul tells us that <HI>charity is the bond of perfectne&s;s.</HI> When charity is
<PB N="348" REF="377">once departed, there is nothing left to cement a Chri&s;|tian &s;ociety: and thus we &s;plit into &s;ects and factions, which is the calamity of the pre&s;ent age. As to faith, &s;everal of the articles and my&s;teries of this theological virtue, are not only que&s;tioned but denied. Now when faith and charity have thus taken their flight, hope mu&s;t either be in a &s;olitary condition, or (which is mo&s;t likely) pre&s;umption &s;et above it, which di&s;order commonly ends in de&s;pair. From what I have already ob&s;erved we ought rather to pay a regard to our holy religion, than di&s;pute upon it. For as a learned au|thor &s;ugge&s;ts, <HI>Quaepetefacta &s;unt, quaerere; quaeperfecta &s;unt retractare; et quae definitae &s;unt convellere; quid aliud e&s;t quam de adeptis gratiam non referre?</HI> i. e. "To que&s;tion a point clearly di&s;covered, to touch over things which are well fini&s;hed, and to un&s;ettle matters which have pa&s;&s;ed the te&s;t, what is it but ingratitude for the ble&s;&s;ings we have received?" And to the &s;ame purpo&s;e St. Athana&s;ius argues; <HI>Que unnc a tot &amp; talibus epi&s;copis probata &s;unt, &amp; decreta, clareque demon&s;trate, &s;uperva|cuum e&s;t denuo revocare in judicium.</HI> i. e. "It is a very unnece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s (to &s;peak &s;oftly) to bring the cau&s;e to a rehearing, which has been thoroughly examined, and &s;ettled by &s;o many Bi&s;hops of character." He means the Prelates that a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the council of Nice; for (as St Athana&s;ius goes on) if their deci&s;ions mu&s;t be re examined, this liberty is the way to keep us un|der perpetual uncertainty, and hinder the uncertainty from ever coming to an end. Now, if St. Athana&s;ius thought it unrea&s;onable to que&s;tion the deci&s;ions of the council of Nice, where there were but three hundred and eighteen Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent; how much more unac|countable mu&s;t it be in us to que&s;tion the belief and practice of the whole Catholic church, where, in&s;tead of three hundred, we have three hundred thou&s;and Bi&s;hops to vouch for authority. And as for the grounds and articles of faith, than which nothing ought to be better fixed, and more certain; the&s;e things, I &s;ay,
<PB N="349" REF="378">mu&s;t be very precarious and floating if they hang upon an act of parliament. In earne&s;t this is but a weak &s;upport for &s;o great a weight. And here I de&s;ire your Lord&s;hips to under&s;tand me rightly. I have no inten|tion to &s;ay any thing to le&s;&s;en the authority of parlia|ment. I own the acts of this honourable court are not to be conte&s;ted, when pa&s;&s;ed upon matters within your juri&s;diction. But as to religion, I humbly conceive that is a &s;ubject altogether foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a par|liament. For faith, as I have ob&s;erved before, ought to have a firm ba&s;is, to be as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians, and not &s;tand liable to amend|ments and repeals, and all other ca&s;ualties of the &s;tatute book. We ought not to waver, and be at uncertainties in our belief; for as St. James &s;peaks, <HI>he that doubts or wavers is like a wave of the &s;ea,</HI> always rolling from one figure to another. Be&s;ides, the body of the parliament con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of the temporal nobility, and the com|mons, which, though per&s;ons of great judgment and learning in civil matters, yet divinity is none of their profe&s;&s;ion. The expo&s;ition of the &s;criptures, the read|ing of the antients, has been none of their employment. The&s;e things con&s;idered, they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be rightly qualified to pronounce upon the doctrines and practice of the church: neither do the&s;e things belong to their function, or lie within their character. And for this, my Lords, I appeal to a late in&s;tance. I re|member in this parliament there was a Nobleman's &s;on put under an arre&s;t, and committed. This confine|ment was re&s;ented by your Lord&s;hips, and the honour of the hou&s;e was thought to &s;uffer by it. Upon this re&s;olution, the young gentleman, the bailiff, and the per&s;on at who&s;e &s;uit he was arre&s;ted, were ordered to appear before your Lord&s;hips; but before they were brought into the hou&s;e, it was thought proper to de|bate the matter over again, for fear the hou&s;e might concern them&s;elves in things <HI>without</HI> their cognizance. The ca&s;e was found to contain three points. The fir&s;t
<PB N="350" REF="379">was a debt, and that your Lord&s;hips thought proper to remit to the common law. The &s;econd point was, upon enquiry, found an encroachment upon the court of Chancery: and the third was the arre&s;t and com|mitment, in which the hou&s;e thought them&s;elves con|cerned. Upon the whole, if, by your Lord&s;hips re&s;o|lution, the parliament has no authority to check the courts of common law, and chancery, which relate only to civil ju&s;tice, and turn upon matters which lie open to human rea&s;on, then, by all force of con&s;e|quence, your preten&s;ions mu&s;t be &s;till lower in matters of faith; in matters of faith and religion, which &s;o far exceed the extent of rea&s;on. The &s;ubject of this bill being of this &s;ublime nature, there are three things principally to be con&s;idered. Fir&s;t, the importance of the matter; &s;econdly, the ob&s;curity of the ca&s;e, and the difficulty in trying the truth; and, thirdly, the danger of mi&s;taking the point, and coming to a wrong re&s;olution. As to the fir&s;t, the importance of the matter, nothing can be greater. It is no temporal in|tere&s;t, no money-bu&s;ine&s;s, no branch of property; no, it is of a much higher nature: the fate of eternity, life and death, heaven and hell, are concerned in it. For now, as the &s;cripture &s;ays, <HI>life and death, fire and water, are &s;et before us:</HI> now to judge rightly, in an af|fair of this con&s;equence, is neither every body's talent, nor every body's bu&s;ine&s;s. Father, we &s;hould be e&s;pecially careful, not to pa&s;s a ra&s;h cen&s;ure upon the judgment and practice of our forefathers. Now that &s;y&s;tem of belief, that form of religion, which is to be &s;et a&s;ide by this bill, is the &s;ame which was profe&s;&s;ed by our ance&s;tors for a thou&s;and years, and upwards: and, which is more, it was likewi&s;e received by the univer|&s;al church from the times of the Apo&s;tles. A noble member of this hou&s;e was lately plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that our forefathers lived in the dark, and therefore we have great rea&s;on to lament their ignorance. To this we may an&s;wer, that if our forefathers were within the
<PB N="351" REF="380">hearing of this imputation, we have rea&s;on to be|lieve they would reply, as our Saviour did to the wo|men that lamented him, <HI>Weep not for us, but for your|&s;elves.</HI> Secondly, as the &s;ubject is of the la&s;t impor|tance, &s;o is the matter perplexed, and not to be di&s;|intangled without difficulty and penetration. The que&s;tion to be re&s;olved relates to the ma&s;s-book, and the new common prayer. The fir&s;t by the bill is to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, as unorthodox and indefea&s;ible; the other to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as agreeable to the holy &s;crip|tures. Now, the commendation of the one, and di&s;like to the other, relates to the &s;ame matter, i. e. a right ad|mini&s;tration of the &s;acrament, pur&s;uant to the in&s;titu|tion of our Saviour Chri&s;t. In which admini&s;tration we are to con&s;ider three things; fir&s;t, the in&s;titution of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, which comprehends the matter and &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;acraments. Secondly, the re|gulations of the apo&s;tles, from which the form of the &s;acraments may be &s;aid to emerge. To which, in the third place, we may put the additions of the holy fathers, for the perfecting, and farther advantage in the admini&s;tration. The&s;e three things, as they are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o they are duly ob&s;erved in the ma&s;s book or old &s;ervice. But the other book, which is &s;o much magnified, not only &s;trikes two of them clear out of practice, but makes the third almo&s;t in&s;ignificant. Notwith&s;tanding which, the compilers pretend it ex|actly agreeable to the word of God, our Saviour's in&s;titution, and the cu&s;tom of the primitive church. But, to wave the in&s;i&s;ting upon apo&s;tolical regulations, and primitive tradition, though the&s;e things may ju&s;tly challenge our regard, let us come to the in&s;titution of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and examine which of tho&s;e two books comes up clo&s;eit to his &s;tandard: and, to clear the controver&s;y the better, we'll take the ma&s;s, or, as they call it, the Lord's &s;upper, for an in&s;tance. And here, as all the fathers collect from the &s;criptures, our Saviour in&s;tituted three things. The&s;e he com|manded
<PB N="352" REF="381">to be continued, in remembrance of his pa&s;|&s;ion, until his coming again, <HI>Do this, &amp;c.</HI> The fir&s;t is the con&s;ecration of the ble&s;&s;ed body, and blood of our Saviour Chri&s;t: the &s;econd con&s;i&s;ts in the offer|ing up the &s;ame to God the Father: and the third we may call the communion, i. e. the eating and drink|ing the &s;aid ble&s;&s;ed body and blood of our Saviour Chri&s;t, under the form of bread and wine. The&s;e two things are taken away in the new &s;ervice-book, which the compilers of that book are willing to ac|knowledge. They declaim again&s;t the doctrine of Chri&s;t's being offered oftener than once, though the holy fathers unanimou&s;ly maintain, that Chri&s;t is &s;till offered in an unbloody manner. Now, if the&s;e men would con&s;ider the con&s;equences of their tenets, this reflection might be &s;erviceable to recover them. For if there is no external &s;acrifice, then there is no prie&s;t|hood; for the function of a prie&s;t (as St. Paul informs us) is to offer gifts and &s;acrifices for &s;in. Now if there is no prie&s;thood under the New Te&s;tament, the next inference is that we have no religion: and thus "we are without God in the world." For the&s;e, like the links of a chain, have a clo&s;e con|nexion with one another. Farther, I de&s;ire your Lord|&s;hips to con&s;ider, that the con&s;ecration falls likewi&s;e in this modern liturgy. The&s;e men talk of nothing but the holy communion, but fall &s;hort of the mean|ing of that expre&s;&s;ion, for the things which &s;hould make it holy, i. e. the body and blood of Chri&s;t, are not there. It is true, when the admini&s;tration is duly performed, the communion may well be called holy: for then we receive our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's body and blood into our bodies; and thus we are united with him, like two pieces of wax, which are melted into each other. This &s;imilitude St. Cyril and St. Chry|&s;oftom made u&s;e of upon this occa&s;ion; and, as St. Paul &s;peaks, "We are made fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, and bone of his bone." But this great advantage cannot
<PB N="353" REF="382">be expected from the new book; for by the mini&s;tra|tion pre&s;cribed, Chri&s;t's body is not truly there; for when there is no con&s;ecration, there can be no real pre&s;ence. But this is the ca&s;e of the new &s;ervice; for the&s;e men neither ob&s;erve the form pre&s;cribed by Chri&s;t, nor the cu&s;tom of the church. The Evange|li&s;t informs us, that our Saviour took "bread, ble&s;|&s;ed, broke, and gave it to his di&s;ciples, &s;aying, Take and eat, this is my body, do this in remembrance of me." By the&s;e words, we are commanded to take the broad in our hands, to ble&s;s, and break it; but by the orders of, this book, all this is omitted; for the prie&s;t neither takes the bread in his hand, nor ble&s;&s;es it, nor breaks it. And as for the words, <HI>this is my body,</HI> by the pronouncing of which has St. Chry&s;o&s;tom teaches) the con&s;ecration is performed, their prie&s;ts, when they pronounce the&s;e words of our Saviour, have no regard to the &s;acramental &s;olemnity, or the force of the expre&s;&s;ion, or the effect upon the bread; but make no more of the words than if they were telling a &s;tory. To proceed, the Doctors of the church affirm, that an intention to do that which Chri&s;t did, i. e. "To con&s;ecrate his body and blood," is a circum&s;tance of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. For this pur|po&s;e, the church has appointed certain prayers in the canon of the ma&s;s, to be &s;aid before the con&s;ecration: the words are the&s;e, <HI>Ut fiat nobis corpus et &s;anguis Do|mini no&s;tri, Je&s;u Chri&s;ti,</HI>" i. e. that the elements may be made unto us the body and blood of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Thus the intention of the church, and of the prie&s;t officiating, is plainly declared. But in this new book there is neither any &s;uch intention de|clared, or any petition put up to God for that pur|po&s;e. The contrary does rather appear by the&s;e words in their office; "That we receiving the&s;e thy creatures of bread and wine, may, &amp;c. Which words declare they intend nothing of con&s;ecration. And if &s;o, let them value them&s;elves as much as they plea&s;e upon
<PB N="354" REF="383">their communion, it is to no manner of purpo&s;e, in regard the body of Chri&s;t is not there; which, as I have already ob&s;erved, is the very thing that &s;hould be communicated. Ye&s;terday a noble peer was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that he believed Chri&s;t was received in the communion pre&s;cribed by the new &s;ervice: but upon his being a&s;ked, whether he wor&s;hipped him there, he an&s;wered, No, nor ever intended it. Now this is a &s;trange opinion, that Chri&s;t &s;hould not be wor&s;hipped where-ever he is owned to be pre&s;ent. I grant they tell us they wor&s;hip our Saviour no le&s;s than we do: but then they di&s;tingui&s;h, and affirm it is with re&s;pect to his being in heaven, and not as he is pre&s;ent in the &s;a|crament; which is ju&s;t as if a man &s;hould &s;ay, that he is willing to pay a civil wor&s;hip to his Prince, when he &s;its under a &s;tate, and has his robes on: but if he comes abroad under a di&s;gui&s;e, or in a plain habit, they de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed. And yet, by their favour, he is as much a Sovereign in a freeze coat in the &s;treets, as when he &s;its upon the throne in gold ti&s;&s;ue. And thus he that &s;its upon the throne in gold ti&s;&s;ue. And thus he that &s;it upon the right hand of God, in the appearance of a glorified body, is the &s;ame Chri&s;t which is concealed in the &s;acrament, under the forms of bread and wine. The &s;criptures (as St. Au&s;tin ex|pounds it) command us to wor&s;hip our Saviour's body in the &s;acrament. The text runs thus, <HI>Adorate &s;cabellum ejus,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. Wor&s;hip his foot&s;tool, for it is holy. And now, my Lords, I beg you would plea&s;e to con&s;ider the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, and whether your Lord&s;hips are &s;ufficiently qualified to examine the points, and pronounce upon the ca&s;e, i. e. Whether your Lord&s;hips are furni&s;hed &s;o far with ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical learning, as to give a judgment whether the body of Chri&s;t is <HI>con&s;ecrated, offered, adored,</HI> and truly <HI>communicated</HI> by the order of this new book? whether the&s;e acts and circum&s;tances are made e&s;&s;en+tial by the in&s;titution of our Saviour, and whether this <HI>new book</HI> follows the direction of that infallible rule?
<PB N="355" REF="384">The&s;e things, as I ob&s;erved to your Lord&s;hips, are weighty and perplexed; and it is no ea&s;y matter not to fall into an error. And then your Lord&s;hips may likewi&s;e con&s;ider the condition of the other &s;acraments; and that the&s;e are either perfectly &s;unk, or mangled after the &s;ame manner by this book. Thirdly, Your Lord&s;hips may plea&s;e to remember the great danger you draw upon your&s;elves, by undertaking to judge in the cau&s;e, e&s;pecially if you &s;hould happen to make a wrong deci&s;ion; for then, be&s;ides the misfortune of your own per&s;ons, you will prove the unhappy occa|&s;ion of mi&s;leading others. King Jeroboam has this mark &s;et upon him, as an aggravation of his mi&s;be|haviour, that, be&s;ides his per&s;onal mi&s;carriage, "he made I&s;rael to &s;in." My Lords, I intreat you would be very careful to prevent the application of this text. To &s;peak freely, in my judgment, if you pa&s;s this bill, you will not only err your&s;elves, but be in&s;tru|mental in mi&s;leading the nation, for which you mu&s;t expect to give an account to Almighty God. Tho&s;e who are well read in eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, and ac|quainted with the methods of the church, in debating religious controver&s;y, can ea&s;ily inform your Lord|&s;hips, that the&s;e matters have been all along decided by the clergy, and not by the laity. The Arian here&s;y, in the reign of Con&s;tantine the Great, was canva&s;&s;ed and condemned in the council of Nice; the here&s;y of Macedonius, in the fir&s;t council of Con&s;tantinople, in the time of Theodo&s;ius the Great; the here&s;y of Ne&s;torius, in that of Ephe&s;us, in the reign of Theo|do&s;ius the Younger; the here&s;y of Eutyches, in the council of Chalcedon, under Mercian. But here we are to ob&s;erve, that none of tho&s;e religious Emperors ever convened their temporal nobility, or commons, to advi&s;e, or determine in the&s;e controver&s;ies. They did not refer the ca&s;e to the majority of the laity, nor go to the poll to di&s;cover truth. And to come nearer home, to the third council of Toledo in Spain, and to
<PB N="356" REF="385">a French council, in the reign of Charles the Great; in both the&s;e, the cu&s;tomary u&s;age of the church was ob&s;erved. The Prelates had the Pope's leave to meet, and then reformed the abu&s;es, and decided the matters in que&s;|tion. And the Princes brought none of the laity to intermeddle in the affair: neither did they them&s;elves offer to debate the matter, but left the controver&s;ies entirely to the management of the clergy: nor need we wonder at this conduct in Catholic Princes, for even heretical Emperors declined bringing the laity to interpo&s;e in religious di&s;putes. Thus Con&s;tantius and Valens, who drew &s;everal &s;ynods together, left the de|ci&s;ion to the body of the clergy. And the Emperor Zeno, who was a favourer of Eutyches, managed by the &s;ame rule. Nay, in the acts of the Apo&s;tles, the Infidels refu&s;ed to concern them&s;elves this way: for when St. Paul was brought before Gallio, and charged with teaching the people to wor&s;hip God contrary to the laws of the country, this Magi&s;trate replied, "If it were any manner of wickedne&s;s, O ye Jews, I might well bear with you: but if it be concerning any que&s;|tions or doubts in the law," i. e. if it be a charge con|cerning your religion, "I will be no judge in the&s;e matters." I be&s;eech your Lord&s;hips to recollect that all Princes and Magi&s;trates, Catholic, Heretic, and Infidel, have all along refu&s;ed to put them&s;elves in a po&s;t, which your Lord&s;hips are now going to challenge. But I &s;hall di&s;tre&s;s your Lord&s;hips patience no longer, and conclude with the mention of two in&s;tances. The fir&s;t is in the Emperor Theodo&s;ius the Great, who makes no &s;cruple to confe&s;s, that, <HI>Illicitum e&s;t qui non &s;it ex ordine &s;anctorum epi&s;coporum, eccle&s;ia&s;ticis &s;e immi&s;|cere tractatibus.</HI> i. e. "It is not lawful for a man who has not the epi&s;copal character, to interpo&s;e in religious affiars." The other is a &s;aying of the Emperor Va|lentinian; <HI>Mihi quidem qui in &s;orte plelis &s;um, fas non e&s;t i&s;ta curio&s;us &s;crutari: Sacerdotes quibus i&s;la curae &s;unt, inter &s;eip&s;os, quocunque loco voluerint, conveniant:</HI> i. e.
<PB N="357" REF="386">"It is not lawful for me, &s;aith the Emperor, who am but a layman, to enter into any curious enquiry upon the&s;e matters: this is the Bi&s;hops bu&s;ine&s;s, and there|fore let them meet about it where they plea&s;e." Now if the&s;e Emperors had nothing to do in &s;uch debates, I mu&s;t crave leave to &s;ay your Lord&s;hips have as little.</P>
<P>And thus the Bi&s;hop concludes his &s;peech, de&s;iring their Lord&s;hips to con&s;ider what was offered, and in|terpret him favourably.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t readers may be judicious enough to di&s;intan|gle the matter; it being no difficult matter to &s;how the principles laid down, the authorities produced, and the con&s;equences drawn, will not bear in the application. The advantage gained by the reformed, at the confe|rence in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 329 of this volume.</NOTE>, &s;moothed the pa&s;&s;age for the uniformity-bill, and brought over a majority of the hou&s;es; and thus the artful and elaborate rhe|toric of Scot and Fecknam were di&s;appointed. The rea&s;on why we have no an&s;wers to the&s;e &s;peeches is, becau&s;e there were no reformed Bi&s;hops then &s;itting in the upper hou&s;e: for the controver&s;y was too much embarra&s;&s;ed with eccle&s;ia&s;tical learning, to be managed by the temporal nobility. When the bill pa&s;&s;ed, the Archbi&s;hop of York, the Bi&s;hops of Ely, London, Worce&s;ter, Landaff, Coventry, Litchfield, Exeter, Che&s;ter, and Carli&s;le, the Marquis of Winche&s;ter, the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, the Vi&s;count Montague, and the Lords Morley, Stafford, Dudley, Wharton, Rich, and North, di&s;&s;ented. The parliament approved of the new revi&s;ed draught of the liturgy, excepting in one circum&s;tance. The committee of divines had left the people at liberty to receive the communion, either kneeling or &s;tanding; which the parliament re&s;trained to kneeling, agreeable to the fir&s;t &s;ervice book of King Edward. The penalty for depraving the common prayer, for the third offence, is the forfeiture of all the criminal's goods and chattels, and impri&s;onment
<PB N="358" REF="387">during life. This clau&s;e did not pa&s;s without a guard for the honour and privileges of the Lords: for it is expre&s;sly provided, <HI>that all and &s;ingular Lords of parlia|ment</HI> &s;hall be tried by their peers. And thus, in the late reign, it was enacted, that all Lords of parlia|ment, having place and voice in parliament, are to be tried by their peers, in ca&s;e of petit trea&s;ons, murder, and felony. Sir Edward Coke makes no &s;cruple to affirm, that the Bi&s;hops are Lords of parliament. His rea&s;ons are undeniable. "They hold of the King, &s;ays he, by barony, and are called by writ to parlia|ment." From hence it follows, that, by the &s;tatutes of Queen Mary and Elizabeth, the Bi&s;hops have a right to be tried by their Peers, no le&s;s than the temporal nobility.</P>
<P>During this &s;e&s;&s;ions a peace was concluded at Ca|$eau in the Cambre&s;is, with the French and Scots. By the French treaty, Calais, and its dependences, were to be re&s;tored to the Queen, after the term of eight years The parliament was di&s;&s;olved on May 28, and the Sunday afterwards the common prayer was u&s;ed in the Queen's own chapel; as it was, at Mid|&s;ummer, in all pari&s;h-churches throughout the kingdom: the people having been u&s;ed to it in King Edward's time, it was received with great joy in all places. As Elizabeth had no great rea&s;on to expect the peace would be o$long continuance, and as &s;he had propo&s;ed to employ the lei&s;ure it afforded her to promote a refor|mation, &s;he re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time in e&s;tabli&s;hing an uniformity in religious wor&s;hip. In Edward's time nothing had been a greater ob&s;truction to the progre&s;s of the reformation, than the compliance of &s;everal Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops, after they had oppo&s;ed in parliament all the bills that pa&s;&s;ed in its favour: &s;kreened by their own conformity, they encouraged non-conformity in the clergy and people of their dioce&s;es, and either con|nived at, or protected, &s;uch as di&s;obeyed the King's injunctions. There had been in that reign a majority
<PB N="359" REF="388">of Bi&s;hops, with the two Archbi&s;hops at their head, well affected to the reformation, and zealous to pro|mote it; &s;o that the Prelates, attached to the Papacy, had no way to take for keeping up in the nation any regard for the &s;ee of Rome, and the &s;uper&s;titions and novelties it had introduced into religious wor&s;hip, &s;o likely to &s;ucceed, as by retaining their &s;ees, and em|ploying their epi&s;copal authority to protect &s;uch of the clergy as mangled the liturgy, in&s;tilled prejudices a|gain&s;t it into the people, and otherwi&s;e &s;erved the cau&s;e of Popery. But now, having found them&s;elves una|nimous in their parliamentary mea&s;ures, they vainly imagined that, holding altogether, they could put a &s;top at once to the reformation: and, perhaps, being a&s;hamed of &s;o many &s;hiftings and changes, they re&s;ol|ved not to comply any more, nor take the oath of &s;u|premacy, which they had &s;o often taken, either as Bi&s;hops or prie&s;ts, in the reigns of the late Kings, Henry and Edward. The mo&s;t eminent for learning and merit among the reformed clergy had, in Queen Mary's time, been either martyred for their religion, or had di&s;appeared, living either in exile abroad, or &s;o privately at home in lurking holes (where they applied them&s;elves entirely to their &s;tudies) that they could not be di&s;covered: and this encouraging many of the in|ferior Popi&s;h clergy to think them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary, and that the churches could not be &s;upplied without their mini&s;tration, they took up likewi&s;e the re&s;olution of &s;tanding out, and of quitting their preferments; a conduct which &s;everal of them are &s;aid to repent of, when they found them&s;elves di&s;appointed in their ex|pectation. The Queen, who, out of a de&s;ire to have every thing done according to law, had hitherto borne the contradictions of the Bi&s;hops, re&s;olved now to pro|ceed roundly again&s;t them: and they were all &s;ummon|ed to appear, on May 15, before the council; when, putting them in mind of the late acts for re&s;toring re|ligion and the &s;upremacy of the crown, &s;he recom|mended
<PB N="360" REF="389">the affairs of the church to their con&s;ideration, and pre&s;&s;ed them to &s;uppre&s;s all the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions. Heath, Archbi&s;hop of York, an&s;wering in the name of the re&s;t, de&s;ired her to recollect her &s;i&s;ter's attach|ment to the &s;ee of Rome, and her engagement with the Pope, which, he thought, bound her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: and exhorted her to reunite with the Papacy. She told them that her &s;i&s;ter had no power to bind her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to an u&s;urped authority; that, her crown being inde|pendent, &s;he owned no &s;uperior on earth; that the Pope's u&s;urpation over Princes was in&s;upportable; and that &s;he &s;hould look upon all her &s;ubjects, whether ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical or civil, as enemies to God and the crown, who &s;hould abet his preten&s;ions, or own any foreign power what&s;oever.</P>
<P>A di&s;covery had been lately made of the unlawful corre&s;pondence which Heath and mo&s;t of the&s;e Bi&s;hops had held with Rome in King Edward's time; their plots for cutting off the Protector, with the wi&s;e&s;t of the council, and for &s;trengthening the intere&s;t of the Pope and the Romi&s;h religion; to which the late Queen Mary was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been privy. This appear|ed by &s;everal letters and papers found in her clo&s;et, and &s;ealed up at the time of her decea&s;e, by the Earl of Su&s;&s;ex, to who&s;e cu&s;tody they had been committed. It was propo&s;ed, at fir&s;t, to pro&s;ecute the Bi&s;hops for the&s;e trea&s;onable practices: but the Queen's pardons, at her coronation, and the conclu&s;ion of the late par|liament, extending to all crimes perpetrated before her acce&s;&s;ion, the council thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to tender them the oath of &s;upremacy. There were about fourteen of them; and all refu&s;ed the oath, except Kitchin Bi&s;hop of Landaff. The others were, Heath of York, Bonner of London, White of Winche&s;ter, Ton&s;tal of Durham, Thirlby of Ely, Wat&s;on of Lin|coln, Po&s;e of Peterborough, Bourne of Wells, Tuber|ville of Exeter, Bayne of Litchfield, Morgan of St. David's, Oglethorpe of Carli&s;le, Pate of Worce&s;ter,
<PB N="361" REF="390">Scot of Che&s;ter, and Goldwell, who had been tran&s;la|ted by the Pope from St. A&s;aph to Oxford, but had not taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this la&s;t &s;ee by rea&s;on of Queen Mary's decea&s;e. The three la&s;t of the&s;e cho&s;e to quit the kingdom; the re&s;t, who&s;e &s;ees were vacant in law upon refu&s;al of the oath, were deprived, one after an|other, in June, July Augu&s;t, and September: and, notwith&s;tanding the barbarous u&s;age of the reformed Bi&s;hops in the late reign, were treated with great hu|manity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oglethorpe died &s;oon after of an apoplexy, Bayne of the &s;tone, and Morgan of &s;ome other di&s;temper, in the December following; all of them in their beds, and at full liberty Heath and Pole lived on their own e&s;tates, and died at la&s;t, as White and Tuberville did, at liberty. Ton&s;tal and Thirlby were well entertained, till their deaths, at Lambeth, by Archbi&s;hop Parker; as Bourne was by Dr. Carew Dean of Exeter. When any of them tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws, and preached in their pontifical habits, they got off with a &s;hort con|finement, and gentle reprimand, upon promi&s;ing not to offend for the future. Bonner alone was confined to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea upon this occa&s;ion, not &s;o much for his inhumanity in putting &s;o many to death in the late reign, as to pre&s;erve him from the revenge of their relations, and the fury of the populace, who held him in the utmo&s;t dete&s;ta|tion; for he had the liberty (though he dur&s;t not u&s;e i) of going abroad. Wat&s;on, a &s;our moro&s;e man, lived twenty-four years after his deprivation, with the Bi&s;hops of Roche&s;ter or Ely: but then embarking in mea&s;ures with the Je&s;uits, and other Romi&s;h emi&s;&s;aries, that came over on trea&s;onable de&s;igns into England, he was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of W$&s;bech in Cambridge&s;hire, where he died. The oath was next tende$ed to the dig$$aries and parochial clergy; and of the&s;e there were twelve Deans, as many Archdeacon, fifteen heads of colleges, fifty prebendaries of cathedral churches, about eighty incumbents of pari&s;hes, that refu&s;ed it, and lo&s;t their prefer|ments on that account; the whole num$er, including the Bi&s;hops, not amounting to two hundred, which&punc; in a realm containing twenty-&s;ix dioce&s;es, and near ten thou&s;and pari&s;hes, was very incon&s;iderable.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Soon after the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament, there was a con&s;ultation at Greenwich, whether it was ad|vi&s;eable for the Queen to admit Martineg$e the Pope's nuncio; which was carried in the negative. The rea&s;ons alledged were, that, by the &s;tatutes of the realm, no per&s;on, with a public character from Rome, was permitted to come into the kingdom: that, at the pre&s;ent juncture, it would be dangerous to entertain an agent from his holine&s;s: and that the countenance of a nuncio would encourage the malecontents, and hinder their compliance with the late e&s;tabli&s;hment. The Pope had been all along adverti&s;ed of the progre&s;s of the reformation. When Elizabeth fir&s;t came to the crown, he was extravagantly haughty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 316 of this volume.</NOTE>. Thus he continued impolitically &s;tiff, and untractable, till things were pa&s;t remedy. At la&s;t, perceiving his ga&s;conades had no effect, he grew more moderate in his demands, dropped his civil &s;overeignty, and only in&s;i&s;ted there might be no innovations in religion. Sir Edward Karne, the Queen's amba&s;&s;ador, told him, that he had no in&s;tructions to an&s;wer upon that head: and that the way for his holine&s;s to obtain &s;atisfaction was to de|clare for the lawfulne&s;s of the marriage. This was a &s;hocking reque&s;t to the Pope and Conclave, and could not be complied with, without putting a di&s;grace upon the former proceedings of that court. They cho&s;e rather to ri&s;que the event, than run upon that rock: and when, by farther advices from England, the pontiff under&s;tood that a revolution in the church was coming forward, he commanded Karne not to depart Rome without leave; and in the mean time to take the government of the Engli&s;h ho&s;pital there. The Pope's aim, in putting this re&s;traint upon Karne, was to pre|vent his giving intelligence of the practices carried on by the French and the court of Rome again&s;t the Queen. But Karne had &s;ent &s;ome advices of this
<PB N="364" REF="395">intrigue already: and the de&s;ign was quickly no &s;e|cret, nor needed any agent to di&s;cover it. Mary Queen of Scots, &s;wayed by the ambition of the Dau|phin her hu&s;band, the Pope's incitement, and the ad|vice of the French King, put up a claim to the Briti&s;h &s;overeignty: founding her right upon de&s;cent, as heir to the late Queen Mary. The&s;e preten&s;ions could not be &s;upported, without throwing a blemi&s;h upon Queen Elizabeth's birth, and plainly declaring her illegitimate. This was a &s;evere provocation, and gave the Queen a la&s;ting aver&s;ion to that Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus alarmed with a competition, the Queen provided for her defence,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen's injunctions.</NOTE> and went on with greater vigour in the reformation. For this end a body of injunctions was &s;et forth; im|porting much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of King Edward. The new regulations were, fir&s;t, concerning the u&s;e of &s;inging, which the Queen would have kept up to pre|&s;erve the &s;cience and advantages of mu&s;ic: that there|fore all maintenance &s;ettled for the &s;ervice of the choirs &s;hould be continued. There was likewi&s;e care taken that an affectation of &s;kill &s;hould not be carried &s;o far, as to make the u&s;e of the church-&s;ervice le&s;s &s;ignificant; and that they &s;hould &s;ing in &s;o plain and di&s;tinct a manner, that the pronunciation &s;hould be altogether as well under&s;tood, as if it had been read. However, for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e that were par|ticularly fond of mu&s;ic, a religious anthem was al|lowed at the beginning and end of the &s;ervice. Pur|&s;uant to this order, the p&s;alms were &s;ung in plain &s;ong, in mo&s;t pari&s;h-churches; and, in the Queen's chapel, in cathedrals, and colleges, the hymns were &s;ung in a more awakening and improved manner. To make the performance farther entertaining and &s;olemn, organs and other in&s;trumental mu&s;ic were made u&s;e of. The cu&s;tomary reverences in churches were ordered to be continued; for in&s;tance, when the name of Je&s;us was pronounced, all per&s;ons were to bow, or &s;hew &s;ome
<PB N="365" REF="396">other &s;uitable mark of re&s;pect. Altars were not to be taken down, but by direction of the par&s;on or church-wardens, and in that ca&s;e the communion-table was to &s;tand in place of the altar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oath of &s;upremacy having been mi&s;con&s;trued by &s;everal per&s;ons, as if the Kings or Queens of this realm had challenged "an authority and power of mini&s;try of divine &s;ervice in the church," the Queen di&s;claims the &s;upremacy in this &s;en&s;e, and that her Ma|je&s;ty neither does, nor ever will challenge &s;uch authority. She al&s;o declared that &s;he intended to &s;tretch the <HI>regale</HI> no farther than it was carried by Henry VIII. and by Edward VI. "and was of ancient time due to the imperial crown of this realm." How far this reached, the <HI>admonition</HI> proceeds to explain; that is, "Under God to have the &s;overeignty and rule over all manner of per&s;ons born within the&s;e realms, dominions, and country, either eccle&s;ia&s;tical or temporal, &s;o as no foreign power ought to have any &s;uperiority over them."

<P>About Mid&s;ummer the Queen i&s;&s;ued commi&s;&s;ions for a royal vi&s;itation all over England, by commi&s;|&s;ioners a&s;&s;igned for different circuits. They proceeded upon the plan of the injunctions; and had be&s;ides a book of articles printed for that purpo&s;e. By the&s;e directions all carved images, paintings, counterfeit miracles, and other &s;uper&s;titious remains, were re|moved out of the churches, and defaced<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The di&s;covery of a late impo&s;terious practice the more induced the Queen to give way to the removal of images. At the arrival of the Earl of Su&s;&s;ex, the Queen's Lieutenant, in Ireland, the litany was &s;ung in Engli&s;h at Chri&s;t church, Dublin. Some bigotted Papi&s;ts were much offended, and endeavoured to retrieve their old &s;ervice by counterfeiting a miracle. For this purpo&s;e, a marble figure of our Saviour, &s;tanding in the cathedral, with a reed in his hand, and a crown of thorns upon his head, was ob&s;erved to bleed through the thorns upon the face of the crucifix. This wonder|ful appearance happened in &s;ervice-time, when the Lord Lieute|nant, the Archbi&s;hop, and the re&s;t of the privy council, were at church. When this was perceived by the people, they were &s;trangely affected, e&s;pecially when one privy to the contrivance told them, "that our Saviour could not chu&s;e but &s;weat blood, when here&s;y was come into the church." All the audience not be|ing of the &s;ame mind, the miracle occa&s;ioned a confu&s;ion, and the congregation broke up. Several of the people, however, &s;taid be|hind, fell on their knees, and prayed before the image. The Archbi&s;hop of Dublin, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome foul play. ordered the Sex|ton to wa&s;h and examine the image; in doing which, the man per|ceived a &s;punge &s;oaked with blood in the hollow of the head. One Lee, formerly a monk of the cathedral, had that very Sunday morning placed within the head the &s;punge, which being loaded with blood, it was &s;trained through the cracks of the marble, and fell down in drops upon the face. The cheat being thus di&s;cover|ed, the Archbi&s;hop preached in the church upon that &s;ubject the next Sunday: and, to make the more &s;erviceable impre&s;&s;ion, Lee with his accomplices were planted upon a table before the pulpit, with their hands and legs tied, and their crime written on a paper fixed to their brea&s;ts. In this manner they appeared three Sundays, were impri&s;oned for &s;ome time, and then bani&s;hed the realm. A detail of this impo&s;ture was tran&s;mitted by Archbi&s;hop Curwin; which being pre&s;ented to the Queen by Parker, gave a turn to her inclination, and prevailed with her to con&s;ent to the removal of images: but all that divine's a learning and zeal could not per&s;uade the Queen to part with the crucifix, and lighted tapers, in her own clo&s;et. She thought, probably, that the arguing again&s;t the u&s;e, from the abu&s;e, was &s;hort of exact rea&s;oning. <HI>See an account of-another impo&s;ture of much the &s;ame nature, called</HI> the rood of grace, <HI>page</HI> 471 <HI>of vol.</HI> ii. <HI>of this work.</HI></NOTE>.

However, the ignorant zeal of &s;ome people carried them too far in this exerci&s;e; for not only images were de&s;troyed, but copes, altar|carpets, prayer-books, other church-furniture, and crucifixes, were burnt together. The Queen and court did not countenance this furious zeal: and the reader may &s;ee an ample di&s;&s;ertation on images, &amp;c. in church|es, page 77 of this volume.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of the Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops lately turned out was not neglected abroad. The Emperor, and other Roman Catholic Princes, &s;olicited the Queen to deal favourably with them, and to allow the Papi&s;ts &s;ome churches in cities and large towns; but without effect, as &s;uch an indulgence would be contrary to the public intere&s;t, and would encourage faction and an unrea|&s;onable &s;eparation.</P>

The Queen, who had made every thing &s;ub&s;ervient to her intere&s;t, had, on the Chri&s;tmas-eve before, cau&s;ed the like ob&s;equy to be celebrated in honour of the Emperor Charles V. but that had been performed by the Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops af|ter the Roman manner; whereas the gro&s;&s;er &s;uper&s;ti|tions of Popery were omitted, and the communion re|ceived on this occa&s;ion. Parker was con&s;ecrated at Lambeth on Sunday, December 17, by Barlow and Scory, Bi&s;hops elect of Chiche&s;ter and Hereford, Miles Coverdale, late Bi&s;hop of Exeter, and John Hod&s;kins, &s;uffragan Bi&s;hop of Bedford, according to the ordinal of Edward VI. newly reprinted for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Roman Catholics, becau&s;e the Primate, after his con&s;e|cration, gave an entertainment at the Nag's-Head tavern in Cheap|&s;ide, have affected to ridicule his ordination as irregular, and brand it with the appellation of <HI>the Nag's-Head con&s;ecration:</HI> but a full di&s;proof of this calumny may be &s;een in that Prelate's regi&s;ter, in which every thing relating to his con&s;ecration is entered at large; and that ludicrous piece, called Ward's <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation,</HI> is only proper to mi&s;lead the ignorant, and is neither believed nor deemed of &s;ufficient authority or authenticity by the &s;en&s;ible Papi&s;ts, one of whom (father Courayer) has publi&s;hed an irrefragable vin|dication of the validity of the con&s;ecration in the church of Eng|land.</NOTE>.

<P>The &s;ettlement of the reformation in England en|couraged &s;ome of John &agrave; La&s;co's congregation to return hither<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 126 and 193 of this volume.</NOTE>, and petition for their church, in Au&s;tin Friers, granted them by King Edward VI. Utenhovius, a man of learning and condition, who had formerly been
<PB N="369" REF="400">a member of this congregation, came over with recom|mendatory letters from Bullinger to the Queen. This Utenhovius, with one Peter de Loene, a mini&s;ter, joined them&s;elves at fir&s;t to one Adrian Hamp&s;te|dius's congregation. The granting him a new patent, with the old privileges, was at fir&s;t refu&s;ed; the Bi|&s;hops having &s;ugge&s;ted to the Queen, that making a foreigner a &s;uperintendant could not be done without maiming the juri&s;diction of the dioce&s;ian. To take off this objection, they cho&s;e Grindal Bi&s;hop of London for their &s;uperintendant. The French Prote&s;tants, though formerly incorporated with the Low Dutch and Germans in King Edward's patent, made no at|tempt to recover their former privileges. However, they had the u&s;e of a church in Threadneedle-&s;treet, belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Wind&s;or. It was part of St. Anthony's ho&s;pital, and &s;till continues for the u&s;e of that nation.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Jewel preached a &s;ermon on March 30 this year, in Lent, at Paul's cro&s;s, upon the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle St. Paul; "for I have received of the Lord that which al&s;o I delivered unto you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 23.</NOTE>." From this text he took occa&s;ion to make that remarkable chal|lenge in defence of the reformation. The Papi&s;ts ha|ving charged the church of England with novelty, and departing from primitive doctrine and practice, to wipe off the&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, the Bi&s;hop put the cau&s;e up|on a bold i&s;&s;ue, and declared in the pulpit, that "if any learned men of all our adver&s;aries, or if all the learned men that are alive, are able to bring one &s;uffi|cient &s;entence out of any old Catholic Doctor or Fa|ther, or out of any old general council, or out of any of the holy &s;criptures of God, or any one example of the primitive church, whereby it may be clearly and plainly proved, that, for the fir&s;t &s;ix hundred years af|ter Chri&s;t, there was any private ma&s;s in the world;

<P>This challenge made a great noi&s;e, and the Papi&s;ts thought them&s;elves obliged to an&s;wer it. Dr. Cole, late Dean of St. Paul's, was the fir&s;t who undertook the conte&s;t: his manner was &s;mooth and friendly, and &s;ome letters pa&s;t between him and the Bi&s;hop. Ra&s;tall entered the li&s;ts, and engaged with more heat, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e were &s;econded by Dormer and Mar&s;hal. Dr. John Harding, an Engli&s;h divine, who retired to Louvain, was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ad|ver&s;ary. He had been a &s;trong Prote&s;tant in the reign of King Edward, but relap&s;ed to Popery when Queen Mary came to the crown. He offered at a thorough an&s;wer, and con&s;idered the challenge from point to point: but his te&s;timonies did not reach up to the age for which they were cited. He makes u&s;e of counter|feit records, and cites the decretal epi&s;tles, as if they were written by the Popes who&s;e names they carry. The Bi&s;hop fir&s;t publi&s;hed an an&s;wer, and afterwards a rejoinder to Harding's performances.

<P>Paul IV. dying, the &s;ee of Rome, after a vacancy of four months, was filled with John Angelo Cardi|nal of Medicis, who took the name of Pius IV. This Pope appeared not of &s;o haughty and imperious a tem|per as his predece&s;&s;or: he wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that pro|ceeding to extremities, without a proportionable power, was a dangerous experiment: that violent mea&s;ures had been often un&s;ucce&s;sful; and that &s;everal kingdoms had been lo&s;t by un&s;ea&s;onable &s;tiffne&s;s and rigour. By this rough treatment, for in&s;tance, England went off from Clement VII. and, when it was afterwards recovered, the imperious demands of the late Pope had &s;o di&s;gu&s;t|ed Queen Elizabeth, that &s;he immediately gave in to the reformation. However, this Pope did not de&s;pair of gaining her by &s;mooth applications; to which pur|po&s;e he di&s;patched Parpalia, Abbot of St. Saviour's, with a letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter, from Cambden, is as follows: Deare&s;t daughter in Chri&s;t, health and apo&s;tolic benediction.

<P>About this time, a form of belief, dige&s;ted into eleven articles, was &s;et forth by the Bi&s;hops,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Articles to be owned by the clergy.</NOTE> and ordered to be read by the clergy at their fir&s;t entering upon their cures. The &s;econd article declares, that all errors and here&s;ies may be &s;ufficiently confuted by &s;cripture. The fifth affirms the Queen's &s;uperiority and prerogative in all cau&s;es, as well eccle&s;ia&s;tical as temporal, to be a|greeable to the word of God, and rightfully belonging to her Highne&s;s, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and extent, as it is declared in the late act of parliament, and explained in her Maje&s;ty's injunctions. The eighth affirms, that the difu&s;e of <HI>exorci&s;m,</HI> oil, &s;alt, &s;pittle, or hallowing of the water in the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m, is no exception|able omi&s;&s;ion: becau&s;e the&s;e ceremonies are no part of the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;acrament. The la&s;t di&s;allows the u&s;ual flouri&s;hing upon images, relicks, and counterfeit miracles. And all repre&s;entations of the invi&s;ible God in the figure of an old man, or of the Holy Gho&s;t in that of a dove, and all other modes of divine wor&s;hip unwarranted by &s;cripture, &s;uch as pilgrimages, &s;etting up candles, and praying upon beads, are directly cen|&s;ured.</P>
<P>Elizabeth gloried in the reformation &s;he had e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and the foreign world &s;tood amaz$d at her having done it with &s;uch apparent facility, and without the lea&s;t di&s;turbance: &s;he loved the decorum, and even &s;plendor of religion, and did not care that the exterior face of the church of England &s;hould appear mean and
<PB N="374" REF="405">fordid in the eyes of foreigners, who already admired the wi&s;dom, vigour, and dignity of her admini&s;tration. This year, the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the &s;criptures, commonly called the Geneva Bible, was publi&s;hed at Geneva. There are two epi&s;tles prefixed to the work, one to the Queen, and another to the reader. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es charged the Engli&s;h reformation with the re|mains of Popery, and endeavoured to prevail with the Queen to &s;trike off &s;everal ceremonies. This offen&s;ive application was probably the rea&s;on why the&s;e epi&s;tles were omitted in the next impre&s;&s;ion. The Queen's in|dulging a French Pre&s;byterian church in England en|couraged great numbers of that nation, and of the Dutch, to come over and &s;ettle in the maritime towns: and here, under the &s;helter of the reformed religion, they maintained &s;everal gro&s;s errors and here&s;ies. Some of the&s;e were German Anabapti&s;ts, and others, who propagated opinions of a very dangerous tendency. To &s;top the &s;preading of this infection, the Queen, by a proclamation, ordered tho&s;e, both aliens and natural born Engli&s;h, who maintained the&s;e opinions, to de|part the kingdom within one and twenty days, under penalty of impri&s;onment, and forfeiture of their goods. Notwith&s;tanding this order, &s;everal &s;kreened them|&s;elves with their Prote&s;tancy, and joined the French and Dutch congregations both in London and other places. And here, by venting &s;ome of their opinions, they oc|ca&s;ioned &s;uch warm conte&s;ts, that Peter Martyr found it nece&s;&s;ary to interpo&s;e his intere&s;t for bringing them to a better temper. To this purpo&s;e he wrote a letter, from Zurich, &s;uper&s;cribed to the church of &s;trangers in the city of London.</P>
<P>About this time another proclamation was &s;et forth relating to the church. The Queen, by her injunc|tions, had ordered the removing all paintings, and other monuments of counterfeit miracles and idolatry, both from churches and private hou&s;es. Some people, either out of avarice or puritani&s;m, or both, had mi&s;|applied
<PB N="375" REF="406">the execution of this order, by carrying it much farther than her Maje&s;ty had intended. Thus, under the colour of the&s;e injunctions, they defaced the images of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and his Apo&s;tles, and de&s;troyed the hi&s;torical repre&s;entations of &s;cripture in the church-windows: and their zeal carried them to the pulling away coats of arms, and monumental in|&s;criptions, where they found any pictures in their neighbourhood. And becau&s;e the bells had been con|&s;ecrated, and the churches abu&s;ed to &s;uper&s;tition, and idolatrous wor&s;hip, they took down the bells, turned the &s;teeples to pigeon hou&s;es, and &s;tripped the roof for the lead. All this ravage and di&s;order was forbid|den by the proclamation, under pain of impri&s;onment during her Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, and &s;uch farther fine for the contempt as &s;hall be thought meet. A charge was likewi&s;e given to Bi&s;hops, and all other ordina|ries, to enquire of all &s;uch contempts done from the beginning of her Maje&s;ty's reign, and to enjoin the per&s;ons offending to repair the &s;ame within a conve|nient time, and of their doing therein to certify to the privy council, or the council in the &s;tar-chamber, that order may be taken therein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The collegiate church of St. Peter's We&s;tmin&s;ter, which had frequently changed its foundation, and &s;uffered &s;o many revolutions in figure and fortune within twenty years, had now a more la&s;ting &s;ettlement. Fecknam the la&s;t abbot, and his convent, had an offer to keep their preferment, upon condition of taking the oath of &s;u|premacy, and officiating by the Engli&s;h Liturgy: but the&s;e conditions being refu&s;ed, the abbey was di&s;&s;olved by act of parliament. And the Queen having made choice of parcel of the be&s;t lands, conveyed the re&s;t to that church: by her Maje&s;ty's letters-patent, bearing date the &s;econd year of her reign, the foundation is &s;ettled for a Dean, twelve &s;ecular canons, two &s;choolma&s;ters, forty &s;cholars, petty canons, and others belonging to the choir, to the number of thirty, and twelve alms-men. To which may be added &s;tewards, receivers, and &s;ervants belonging to the college. The Dean had the cu&s;tody of the <HI>regalia,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ts at coronation &s;olemnities, and is con&s;tituted ju&s;tice of peace within We&s;tmin&s;ter and its liberties, by act of par|liament. The Dean and Chapter have the privilege of great juri&s;|diction, both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, within the city and liberties of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the precincts of St. Martin's le Grand, and &s;ome cari&s;hes in the county of E&s;&s;ex.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A. D. 1561.] The Queen wrote to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Bi&s;hop of London, and the re&s;t of the commi&s;&s;ioners for cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical, to re|view the <HI>Kalendar</HI> for the <HI>common prayer,</HI> to &s;trike out &s;ome of the le&s;&s;ons, and appoint others which they &s;hould judge more &s;erviceable and in&s;tructive. This letter complains that many churches were unrepaired to a &s;candalous degree; that they were unornamented and very negligently kept; which indecency and di&s;regard is ordered to be rectified. Towards the latter end the Queen takes notice of her permi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>common prayer</HI> in Latin to collegiate churches, and commands the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners to take care that this allowance of her's may not be di&s;appointed or mi&s;managed. That there was occa&s;ion for &s;ome alterations in the Kalendar, appears by the defectivene&s;s of the la&s;t <HI>com|mon prayer</HI> &s;et forth in the reign of King Edward VI. where there was no direction for proper le&s;&s;ons on Sundays. But in a common prayer, printed in the year 1560, there is a Kalendar of fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons for morning and evening prayer on Sundays, throughout the year, and for &s;ome Sundays the &s;econd le&s;&s;ons are appointed. This common prayer was printed before the Queen &s;ent her letter to the commi&s;&s;ioners above-mentioned, as may be collected from the dates. It is likely therefore that the Archbi&s;hop and the re&s;t might &s;ettle the &s;econd le&s;&s;ons for Sundays, then unappointed, and make &s;ome further alterations in the re&s;t of the Kalender. The Queen, making a progre&s;s this &s;um|mer into E&s;&s;ex and Suffolk, took &s;ome umbrage at the figure and behaviour of the clergy; not finding them every where &s;o conformable in their habit, &s;o perfect in their office, nor &s;o di&s;creet in their management, as &s;he expected. She was particularly di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;eeing
<PB N="377" REF="408">their wives in cathedrals and colleges. She therefore i&s;&s;ued out an order to forbid all heads and members of any college, or cathedral church within the realm, having their wives, or any other woman, within the precinct of &s;uch places, under the penalty of forfeiting all eccle&s;ia&s;tical promotions belonging to any cathedral or collegiate church. Secretary Cecil &s;ent this unac|ceptable order to Archbi&s;hop Parker: and to explain him&s;elf the better to Parker's &s;atisfaction, he told him in a letter, that the Queen &s;tood &s;trongly di&s;affected to matrimony in the clergy; that, had it not been for &s;omething of courage and dexterity in him&s;elf, &s;he had ab&s;olutely forbidden churchmen that &s;tate; and that he was glad to compound with her Maje&s;ty, and pro|po&s;ed this expedient to prevent her going farther. The Archbi&s;hop &s;ent the injunction through his pro|vince, pur&s;uant to her Maje&s;ty's order, but was greatly di&s;&s;atisfied with the contents; and afterwards, upon his waiting on the Queen, he was &s;urpri&s;ed with her Maje&s;ty's di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject, as appears by his letter to Secretary Cecil. He acquaints this mini&s;ter, "that he was a&s;toni&s;hed to the la&s;t degree to hear &s;o learned and con&s;cientious a Prince&s;s treat the holy in|&s;titution of matrimony with &s;o much &s;atyrical con|tempt. I wonder (&s;ays he) that &s;tate &s;hould be made a crime in the clergy, which will &s;tand the te&s;t of the la&s;t day; that an engagement which plea&s;es God Al|mighty &s;hould not plea&s;e her Maje&s;ty. I am at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand why her Highne&s;s &s;hould gratify our ad|ver&s;aries &s;o far, as to put us under disfavour upon this account. If our reputation is thus di&s;abled, we &s;hall be rendered incapable of doing God and her Maje&s;ty &s;ervice. As far as my reading and information reach|es, it has been the cu&s;tom of all Princes, both Chri|&s;tian and Pagan, to countenance the mini&s;ters of re|ligion: they thought this a nece&s;&s;ary expedient to re|commend the rules of duty, to pre&s;erve the force of con&s;cience, and &s;upport the government; but now it
<PB N="378" REF="409">is our misfortune to be &s;ingled out from the re&s;t of mankind for infamy and aver&s;ion; to be expo&s;ed to the ignorant and malicious with marks of the greate&s;t di&s;advantage; to be cen&s;ured as if we had no regard to the circum&s;tances of our profe&s;&s;ion; as if we were wholly re&s;igned to appetite, without the lea&s;t check of di&s;cretion. The Queen was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the no|tion of our mi&s;management in this matter, that &s;he repented our being tru&s;ted with the function. This di&s;covery mu&s;t be &s;port to the clergy of the late reign: it mu&s;t be a diver&s;ion to them to &s;ee in what manner we are handled, and with what di&s;tingui&s;hing hard|&s;hips we are treated by the government. But this we &s;hall pa&s;s over in patience, and re&s;t the event with God Almighty." Whether the Secretary acquainted the Queen with this letter, or what &s;ucce&s;s it had with her, does not appear: however, it &s;hews that the Archbi|&s;hop was a plean dealer, and did not want courage.</P>
<P>The Pope renewed his attempt to gain the Queen, having invited her, with other Prote&s;tant Princes, to the council of Trent, and di&s;patched Abbot Marti|nango into England with letters of very &s;mooth con|tents. Among&s;t other things, he acquainted her, that if &s;he would plea&s;e to &s;end either Bi&s;hops or amba&s;&s;a|dors to the council, he did not que&s;tion giving them &s;uch &s;atisfaction as might open a way to a farther ac|commodation. The Nuncio &s;topping in Flanders, &s;ent to the Queen for leave to come forward: upon which, a council being called, and the matter debated, he was refu&s;ed admittance, as the receiving him might imply an acknowledgment of that authority which had been abrogated by act of parliament.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On June 4 this year a terrible fire happened in the cathedral of St. Paul's, London. It broke out near the top of the &s;teeple, burnt down the &s;pire to the &s;tone work, and in four hours con|&s;umed the timber and lead of the whole church. This church was one of the large&s;t in all Chri&s;tendom; &s;even hundred and twenty foot in length, a hundred and thirty in breadth, and in heighth, from the floor to the roof, a hundred and fifty. It was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;et on fire by lightning: but Dr. Heylin &s;ays, that, within thirty years of the writing his Church-Hi&s;tory, an old plumber confe&s;&s;ed on his deathbed, that the church was burnt thro' his negligence, in leaving a pan of coals carele&s;sly in the &s;teeple when he went to dinner.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A. D. 1563.] A new parliament met at We&s;tmin|&s;ter, January 12. The fir&s;t act that pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;|&s;ions is the act of <HI>a&s;&s;urance of the Queen's power over all e&s;tates.</HI> It is pointed again&s;t tho&s;e who maintained the "juri&s;diction of the &s;ee of Rome, formerly unju&s;tly claimed and u&s;urped within this realm." To prevent the ill con&s;equences ari&s;ing from hence, tho&s;e who maintain or defend, by printing, preaching, or teach|ing, the Pope's authority or juri&s;diction upon any part of her Maje&s;ty's dominions, as al&s;o their aiders, a&s;&s;i&s;|tants, and comforters, &s;hall, for the fir&s;t offence, in|cur the penalties provided by the &s;tatute of premunire. There were likewi&s;e two other acts pa&s;&s;ed, one again&s;t fanta&s;tical prophe&s;ies, and another again&s;t witchcraft; and an act for tran&s;lating the Bible and common prayer into Wel&s;h. This la&s;t act puts the direction of the work into the hands of John Scory, Bi&s;hop of Here|ford, Richard Davis of St. David's, Thomas Davis of St. A&s;aph, Rowland Merick of Bangor, and Hugh Jones of Landaff, who were to in&s;pect the tran&s;lation, and take care for the printing of &s;uch a number, that every cathedral, collegiate and pari&s;h church, and cha|pel of ea&s;e, within their re&s;pective dioce&s;es, where Wel&s;h was commonly &s;poken, might be furni&s;hed with one.</P>
<P>In the convocation, which met on January 13, there were &s;everal things aimed at: but excepting a &s;ub&s;idy, and what related to the doctrinal articles, commonly called <HI>the thirty nine articles,</HI> nothing relative to doc|trine or di&s;cipline pa&s;&s;ed; unle&s;s we reckon the autho|ri&s;ing of the Latin catechi&s;m, drawn up for the u&s;e of &s;chools. This catechi&s;m lay unpubli&s;hed till the year
<PB N="380" REF="411">1570, when, at the in&s;tance of the two Archbi&s;hops, it was printed with a dedication to them and their &s;uf|fragans. It was afterwards tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h and Greek. In the whole, it was much the &s;ame with that &s;et forth in the reign of King Edward VI.</P>
<P>A. D. 1564.] This &s;ummer the Queen made a vi&s;it to Cambridge; where being received with all kinds of honour by the univer&s;ity, and entertained with trage|dies, comedies, and &s;chola&s;tical di&s;putations, &s;he &s;ur|veyed every college; and took her leave with a Latin oration, giving them encouragement to pur&s;ue their &s;tudies.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, being impowered by their canons, began to &s;hew their authority, in urging the clergy of their dioce&s;es to &s;ub&s;cribe to the liturgy, rites, and di&s;cipline of the church; and &s;uch as refu&s;ed were branded with the name of Puritans. The Non|conformi&s;ts at this time were divided into two ranks; &s;ome, mild and moderate, contented only to enjoy their own opinions; others, fierce and fiery, to the di&s;tur|bance of church and &s;tate. Among the former was John Fox, who being &s;ummoned by Archbi&s;hop Par|ker to &s;ub&s;cribe, produced the New Te&s;tament in Greek, and &s;aid, "To this I will &s;ub&s;cribe." But when a &s;ub&s;cription to the canons was de&s;ired of him, he re|fu&s;ed it, &s;aying, "I have nothing in the church, &s;ave a prebend at Sali&s;bury; and if you will take it from me, much good may it do you."</P>
<P>The exiles, returned from Geneva, had begun di&s;|putes about the cap, &s;urplice, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical habits. Their aver&s;ion to the habits of the clergy was &s;ounded on their having been worn by Papi&s;ts; though they had mo&s;t of them been in u&s;e before any of the corruptions of Popery were known in the world. The&s;e ill &s;upported &s;cruples made the church look &s;trangely disfigured and party-coloured: therefore the Queen thought fit to make a further &s;ignification of her royal plea&s;ure, legally declared by her Commi&s;&s;ioners for
<PB N="381" REF="412">cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical, according to the acts and &s;tatutes made in that behalf. The Archbi&s;hop is thereupon required, to con&s;ult with &s;uch Bi&s;hops and Commi&s;&s;i|oners, as were next at hand; upon the making of &s;uch rules and orders as they thought nece&s;&s;ary, for the peace of the church, with reference to the pre&s;ent &s;tate thereof. By a &s;tatute made in the la&s;t parliament, for keeping her Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in their due obe|dience, a power was given to the Bi&s;hops to tender and receive the oath of &s;upremacy of all manner of per&s;ons re&s;iding and dwelling in their &s;everal dioce&s;es. Bonner was then pri&s;oner in the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, which, being within the borough of Southwark, brought him within the juri&s;diction of Horn Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, by who&s;e Chancellor the oath was tendered to him. On the refu&s;al of the oath, he was indicted at the King's Bench, upon the &s;tatute, to which he appeared, and de&s;ired that council might be a&s;&s;igned to plead his cau&s;e; which was granted. The bu&s;ine&s;s came under con&s;ideration in the parliament, which met on Septem|ber 30, where the legality of Horn's epi&s;copacy (which was objected again&s;t, in the behalf of Bonner) was cleared by &s;tatute, declaring the legality of tho&s;e Eng|li&s;h Bi&s;hops authority, who&s;e call and con&s;ecration to their place was formerly performed.</P>
<P>This year there was a de&s;ign for reprinting the Ge|neva Bible; and &s;ome time had been &s;pent in the re|view and correction of it. John Bodleigh, one of the principal undertakers, applied to Secretary Cecil for a longer term in the property of the copy. The Secre|tary refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, till he had con&s;ulted Arch|bi&s;hop Parker, and Grindal Bi&s;hop of London. It is probable Cecil might demur to the encouraging another impre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hops intended &s;hortly to publi&s;h a tran&s;lation of their own. However, the Archbi&s;hop and Grindal wrote to him in behalf of the undertakers; but not without &s;ome conditions of &s;e|curity,

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="382" REF="415">viz. that the undertakers &s;hould engage to let the impre&s;&s;ion pa&s;s under their regulation, and not be pub|li&s;hed without their con&s;ent and advice. They, not being willing to come under the&s;e re&s;traints, deferred the impre&s;&s;ion till after Parker's death.</P>
<P>A. D. 1566.] The Archbi&s;hop having lately moved the Queen and Secretary Cecil to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the ex|erci&s;e of di&s;cipline, her Maje&s;ty i&s;&s;ued out her procla|mation, requiring conformity to the habit. The pe|nalty of di&s;obeying the order was deprivation and di&s;|ability of preaching: and &s;ince the Archbi&s;hop com|plained that the London clergy had &s;hewn them&s;elves more &s;tiff in their non-conformity, and that their prac|tice made an impre&s;&s;ion upon the country, the Secre|tary acquainted him, that the Queen was willing the reformation &s;hould begin there; and that, in ca&s;e of non-compliance, it would be expedient to pre&s;s their authority, and proceed with re&s;olution. And to coun|termine their proceedings, and take off the imputation of rigour, her Maje&s;ty de&s;igned to join &s;ome &s;ecular per&s;ons of quality in the commi&s;&s;ion with them. The twenty-&s;ixth of March was appointed for this trial, and Cecil &s;ent the Archbi&s;hop word, that the Lord Keeper Bacon, the Marquis of Northampton, and him&s;elf, in|tended to be there: but none of them came; for it &s;eems they recollected them&s;elves, and declined having a &s;hare in &s;uch unacceptable bu&s;ine&s;s. The city clergy appeared at Lambeth, and &s;everal of them were per|&s;uaded to quit their prejudices, and pre&s;erve them&s;elves. The Archbi&s;hop &s;ent the Secretary a particular account of their proceedings. The i&s;&s;ue was, &s;ixty-one of them promi&s;ed conformity, nine or ten refu&s;ed to appear, and thirty-&s;even could not be brought to compliance. Some of the&s;e la&s;t were men not ill di&s;tingui&s;hed as preachers; but &s;everal of them, as the Archbi&s;hop re|ports, &s;eemed to have a great deal of zeal and good meaning, but with a very moderate proportion of
<PB N="383" REF="416">learning and judgment. According to the mea&s;ures preconcerted, tho&s;e, who continued unreclaimed, had the di&s;cipline driven home upon them: and, the pe|nalties of &s;ilencing and &s;eque&s;tration being executed, and no &s;ign of relaxation upon what was to follow, the di&s;&s;enters broke out into remon&s;trances, and loudly complained of hard u&s;age.</P>
<P>However, the bulk of the Puritan party &s;tood firm in their old opinions: and, for their encouragement, they were not without friends at court. Robert Dudley Earl of Leice&s;ter, and Sir Francis Knolles Vice Cham|berlain, favoured them; and Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham, afterwards &s;ecretary of &s;tate, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the &s;ame intere&s;t. Be&s;ides, Parkhur&s;t, Sandys, and Pil|kington, Bi&s;hops of Norwich, Worce&s;ter and Durham, leaned to their &s;ide in this controver&s;y. But the Queen would not endure any innovation.</P>
<P>A. D. 1567.] This year the controver&s;y touching the habits occa&s;ioned farther mi&s;under&s;tandings, and ended in an open rupture; for now the Puritans drew off from the church, formed &s;eparate congregations, and laid the common prayer book wholly a&s;ide. They pretended that methods of compul&s;ion, and tying the "ceremonies of Antichri&s;t to the &s;ervice of God," was the rea&s;on of their going off. However, they did not at fir&s;t u&s;e extemporary prayers; but officiated by the book made u&s;e of by the Engli&s;h refugees at Ge|neva; to which there were &s;ome additional prayers &s;ubjoined. Thus they quitted the communion of the church, and formed a &s;chi&s;m. However, &s;everal of their mini&s;ters thought, that they carried their excep|tions too far, and refu&s;ed to join them in their &s;e|paration. The&s;e non-conforming meetings incen&s;ed the government, and put the commi&s;&s;ioners upon looking after them. About a hundred of the&s;e di&s;&s;enters met in Plumber's hall, under the pretence of a wedding; but this excu&s;e being thought too &s;lender, about fif|teen of them were apprehended. The next day &s;even
<PB N="384" REF="417">of them, viz. Smith, Nixon, White, Ireland, Haw|kins, Rowland, and Morecraft, were examined before Grindal Bi&s;hop of London, who was not very forward him&s;elf to pre&s;s conformity: and becau&s;e they in&s;i&s;ted on the platform of foreign churches, and pretended to be governed by their precedent, the Dean of We&s;tmin|&s;ter told them, that all the men of learning in Europe were of a different &s;entiment as to their ca&s;e. To this the Bi&s;hop of London added, that even the learned in Geneva were again&s;t them. He produced a letter from &s;ome of the mini&s;ters in that city. The ex|pre&s;&s;ion which mo&s;t affected them was this, "That they &s;hould exerci&s;e their office again&s;t the will of their Prince and Bi&s;hops, we do &s;o much the more tremble at." To reconcile them to the e&s;tabli&s;hment, Grindal a&s;ked them the following que&s;tion, Have we not a godly Prince? Speak, is &s;he evil? To this three of them made their &s;everal an&s;wers thus. William White, "What a que&s;tion is that? the fruits do &s;hew." Thomas Rowland: "No, but the &s;ervants of God are per&s;e|cuted under her." Robert Hawkins: "Why, this que&s;tion the prophet an&s;wereth in the P&s;alms: how can they have under&s;tanding that work iniquity, &s;poiling my people, and extol vanity?" In the progre&s;s of their examination they objected again&s;t the form of the con&s;ecrated bread. Their cavil was, becau&s;e it was given in wafers; which, they &s;aid, was going too near the Roman communion. The Bi&s;hop of London replied, that the church of Geneva, for who&s;e practice they had &s;o great a regard, received it in wafer-cakes. When arguing and gentle applications made no im|pre&s;&s;ion, when, in&s;tead of promi&s;ing to forbear their meetings, they di&s;covered a re&s;olution of maintaining their &s;entiments and &s;eparation, &s;ome of them were re|manded back to pri&s;on; but they were &s;oon after &s;et at liberty. The more learned and con&s;iderable mini|&s;ters of this party di&s;liked the&s;e exce&s;&s;es. It is true, they &s;crupled the practice of the ceremonies &s;uffered in
<PB N="385" REF="418">their preferments, and cho&s;e rather to throw up their functions than to comply. But, notwith&s;tanding their di&s;agreement in the&s;e matters, they were by no means for driving the conte&s;t to a &s;chi&s;m.</P>
<P>A. D. 1568.] This year Thomas Harding, and Nicholas S unders, Doctors in Divinity, received an authority from the Pope to ab&s;olve all the Engli&s;h who returned to the Romi&s;h communion. They were like|wi&s;e empowered to di&s;pen&s;e in all ca&s;es of irregularity, wilful murder excepted. Their commi&s;&s;ion extended to ab&s;olution for here&s;y, provided the per&s;ons recon|ciled ab&s;tained three years from officiating at the altar. One Thomas Heath, a Je&s;uit, brother to the late Archbi&s;hop of York, was &s;eized at Roche&s;ter. He was &s;ent over mi&s;&s;ionary by his &s;uperiors, with in&s;truc|tions to pretend him&s;elf a di&s;&s;enter. He was furni&s;hed with &s;everal Anabapti&s;tical and Arian tracts, and was to throw in a mixture of Puritan doctrines. This Heath, after &s;ix years preaching about the coun|try, in the habit of a poor mini&s;ter, applied him&s;elf to the Dean of Roche&s;ter for preferment. The Dean, to try his talents, gave him a turn in the cathedral. In his &s;ermon, he refined a little upon the church of England, and warped towards Puritani&s;m. His text was, that <HI>prayer was made without cea&s;ing unto God for St. Peter.</HI> From hence he took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e prayers were not &s;uch as were then u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h Liturgy. As it happened, a letter dropped out of his pocket from the pulpit, which was taken up by the Sexton, and delivered to Gue&s;t the Bi&s;hop. It was &s;uper&s;cribed to him, by the name of Thomas Fine, from one Malt, a Je&s;uit of character in Madrid. The purport of it was to in&s;truct him in the manage|ment of his mi&s;&s;ion. Upon this di&s;covery the Bi&s;hop examined him clo&s;ely. At fir&s;t, he only owned, that he had been a Je&s;uit, but was now of another per|&s;ua&s;ion: that he was not entirely of the &s;entiment of the epi&s;copal party, but endeavoured to carry prote&s;|tancy
<PB N="386" REF="419">to a farther improvement, and &s;et the reformed at more di&s;tance from the church of Rome. After this, upon &s;earching his chamber, they found a licence from the Je&s;uits, and a bull from Pope Pius V. In this in&s;trument there was a di&s;cretionary latitude, for preaching what doctrine his &s;uperiors thought fit: which compa&s;s was allowed in order to make mi&s;un|der&s;tandings among the Prote&s;tants. In his trunk were found &s;everal books again&s;t infant bapti&s;m, with other heterodoxies. For this foul practice he was &s;entenced to &s;tand three days in the pillory at Roche&s;|ter, his ears were cut off, his no&s;e &s;lit, and his fore|head marked with the letter R. He was likewi&s;e condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment; but death re|lea&s;ed him in a few months afterwards.</P>
<P>A. D. 1569.] The &s;tore of Papi&s;ts in England began now much to dimini&s;h. Pri&s;ons con&s;umed many, age more of their prie&s;ts, and they had no place in Eng|land whence to recruit them&s;elves. Hereupon they re&s;olved to erect colleges abroad, for the education of Engli&s;h youth. This project, which began this year, was &s;o effectually pro&s;ecuted, that, within the compa&s;s of fifty years, they had founded nine colleges, and furni&s;hed with &s;tudents, for whom they provided a maintenance. Doway college, in Flanders, was founded 1569, by Philip the Second King of Spain: all the recu&s;ants in England being benefactors to it. The fir&s;t rector was William Allen, afterwards Cardinal. Whereas the government of all other Engli&s;h colleges belong to Je&s;uits, this only is ruled by &s;ecular prie&s;ts. The &s;econd college was at Rome, founded anno 1579; Pope Gregory XIII. gave maintenance therein, fir&s;t to &s;ix, then to fourteen, and at la&s;t to three&s;core &s;cholars, to the yearly value of four thou|&s;and crowns. The Welch ho&s;pital in Rome, founded and endowed many hundred years before, by Cad|wallader King of Wales, for Welch pilgrims, with the rich lands thereof, was conferred by the &s;aid Pope
<PB N="387" REF="420">on this college. The thrid college was founded by Philip the Second King of Spain, at Valladolid in Old Ca&s;tile. Donna Loui&s;a de Caravaial, a rich widow lady in Spain, gave all her e&s;tate to this college, and came over to England, where &s;he died. Father Wal|pole, by pretending to have gained Lord Wotton's &s;on and heir to the Romi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion, got above five hundred pounds to this college. Sir Francis Inglefield, privy coun&s;ellor to Queen Mary, for&s;aking his fine e&s;tate in Berk&s;hire, at Queen Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion was a bountiful benefactor to this college. The fourth col|lege was at Seville, founded by Philip the Second King of Spain, anno 1593. The fifth was at St. Omer's in Artois, founded 1596, by the &s;ame Monarch, who gave them a good annuity; for who&s;e &s;oul they &s;ay every day a ma&s;s, and every year an <HI>Obitum.</HI> Their Rector is generally a Fleming, though the college is of Engli&s;h only. The &s;ixth college was at Madrid, founded 1606. The &s;eventh, a college at Louvain, in Brabant, founded the &s;ame year, by Philip the Third King of Spain, who gave a ca&s;tle with a pen&s;ion to the Eng|li&s;h Je&s;uits to build them a college. The eighth col|lege was at Liege in Lukeland, founded 1616. The Archbi&s;hop of Cologne (being at this time al&s;o Bi&s;hop of Liege) gave them a pen&s;ion to live on, and leave to build a college. Many of the Engli&s;h nobility and gentry, under pretence of pa&s;&s;ing to the Spa to re|cover their healths, vi&s;ited this college, and made them large donations. The ninth college was at Ghent in Flanders, founded 1624, by Philip the Fourth, who gave them a pen&s;ion. It is incredible what a va&s;t &s;um of money was yearly carried out of England for the maintenance of the&s;e colleges, having here their pro|vincials, &s;ubprovincials, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and agents, who collected for them. The two colleges of Doway and Rome received &s;uch encouragement, and flouri&s;hed to that degree, that when Sanders wrote, above 300
<PB N="388" REF="421">prie&s;ts had been &s;ent over from thence into Eng|land. To engage the members of the&s;e &s;ocieties the more firmly, and harden them for the bu&s;ine&s;s to which they were bred, they obliged them to take the following oath at their admi&s;&s;ion, provided they were grown up to mens e&s;tate.</P>
<P>"I <HI>A. B.</HI> one bred in this Engli&s;h college, con&s;idering how great benefits God hath be&s;towed upon me, but then e&s;pecially when he brought me out of my own country, &s;o much infected with here&s;y, and made me a member of the Catholic church, as al&s;o de&s;iring with a thankful heart to improve &s;o great a mercy of God, have re&s;olved to offer up my&s;elf wholly to divine &s;er|vice, as much as I may, to fulfil the end for which this college was founded. I promi&s;e therefore, and &s;wear, in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, that I am prepared, from my heart, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace, in due time to receive holy orders, and to re|turn into England, to convert the &s;ouls of my coun|trymen and kindred, when, and as often as it &s;hall &s;eem good to the &s;uperior of this college, &amp;c."</P>
<P>The court of Rome having waited a long time for Queen Elizabeth's recollection, and de&s;pairing now of her recovery, re&s;olved to proceed to extremities, and declare her excommunicated; and publi&s;hed a bull to this effect. About two years after, one John Felton was drawn, hanged, and quartered, for publi&s;hing this bull, and pa&s;ting it up on the gates of the Bi&s;hop of London's palace.</P>
<P>A. D. 1570] This year a parliament met at We&s;t|min&s;ter, wherein &s;everal acts pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Papi&s;ts and Nonconformi&s;ts. Again&s;t the fir&s;t it was enacted, "That to write, print, preach, or affirm, that the Queen was an heretic, &s;chi&s;matic, &amp;c. &s;hould be ad|judged trea&s;on; and that it &s;hould be &s;o accounted, and puni&s;hed, to bring, and put in execution, any bulls, in&s;truments, writings, &amp;c. from the &s;ee of Rome, from the fir&s;t of July following." An act was made
<PB N="389" REF="422">al&s;o again&s;t fugitives, who, being natural born-&s;ubjects of this realm, departed the &s;ame without licence. A|gain&s;t Non-conformi&s;ts it was provided, "That every mini&s;ter &s;hould, before December 25 next following, in the pre&s;ence of his Dioce&s;an or his deputy, declare his a&s;&s;ent to all the articles of religion agreed on in the convocation of 1563, upon pain of deprivation on the refu&s;al thereof." Again&s;t covetous Conformi&s;ts it was provided, "That no &s;piritual college, or ho&s;pital, &s;hall let lea&s;e, other than for the term of twenty years, or three lives; the u&s;ual rent, or more, re&s;erved pay|able yearly during the &s;aid term." It has been already ob&s;erved, that the reformation was oftentimes mi&s;|managed to the impover&s;hing the clergy England was not the only &s;cene of oppre&s;&s;ion; the Iri&s;h church lay under the &s;ame di&s;advantage, as appears by a letter from the Archbi&s;hop of Dublin to Secretary Cecil. He applies to this mini&s;ter in relation to the deanery of St. Patrick's; de&s;iring that he would move the Queen, that this preferment might not be be&s;towed upon any layman, nor made a fee for the Lord Chancellor; but that the Chapter might enjoy the privilege of their charter, and chu&s;e &s;ome learned divine. He likewi&s;e complains of the great want of teachers in that king|dom, alledging that the di&s;loyalty of the &s;ubjects was owing to their ignorance: that the greate&s;t number of benefices within the Engli&s;h pale are impropriated to her Maje&s;ty, and farmed out to &s;uch as have no care for the cure; and that religion &s;uffers very much upon this &s;core: that he wi&s;hed her Maje&s;ty would rather be plea&s;ed to quit &s;ome part of her impropriations for the maintenance of the mini&s;try, who were in a very mi&s;erable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>A. D. 1571.] The convocation met, on April 3, in the chapter hou&s;e of St. Paul's. The &s;ermon was preached by Dr. Whitgift, his text being in Acts xv. 6, <HI>The apo&s;tles and elders came together to con&s;ult of this matter.</HI> From hence he took occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e up|on
<PB N="390" REF="423">the in&s;titution and authority of &s;ynods, touched up|on the oppo&s;ition made to the church by Puritans and Papi&s;ts, dilated on the u&s;e of di&s;tinct habits and reli|gious ornaments, and mentioned &s;everal things which required reformation. In the third &s;e&s;&s;ion Cheney Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter was excommunicated, for not appearing at the convocation, not con&s;tituting a proxy. This unu&s;ual cen&s;ure was pa&s;&s;ed upon the Bi&s;hop for contempt. It was pronounced by the Archbi&s;hop, with the con&s;ent of the upper hou&s;e. But &s;ome time after Higgins, the Bi&s;hop's chaplain, exhibited let|ters of proxy for his Lord, and moved the Bi&s;hop might receive ab&s;olution, which was granted.</P>
<P>A. D. 1572.] The canons made in 1563 were not for nine years afterwards confirmed by act of parlia|ment: but being ratified by parliamentary authority, the Bi&s;hops began the urging of them more &s;everely than before, which occa&s;ioned great di&s;putes with the Puritans. About this time Chark, Trevers, Gardiner, Barber, Che&s;ter, Crook, and Egerton, joined the re&s;t of the Puritan party, in order to their &s;ettling of their di&s;cipline.<NOTE PLACE="inter">The fir&s;t pre&s;|bytery in Eng|land.</NOTE> In order to this they erected a pre&s;bytery at Wand&s;worth in Surry; which, being &s;ituated upon the Thames, was a convenient place for forming a con|gregation out of the Di&s;&s;enters in the city. This fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment was called the <HI>Order of Wand&s;worth</HI> by Field, who was their mini&s;ter. Whether the Queen was pre&s;ently informed of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, is uncer|tain; however, complaints being carried to court of their behaviour, &s;he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, "That the laws for keeping up a uniformity of public wor&s;hip &s;hould be put in execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year happened a cruel ma&s;&s;acre at Paris, the Queen of Navarre and all the heads of the prote&s;tants being invited there to a marriage between Henry of Navarre, and the King's &s;i&s;ter. Above two thou&s;and per&s;ons were murdered in Paris the fir&s;t day, be&s;ides what was killed in the two days following. And Admiral Coligny, the pillar of the reformed church, was killed in his bed on Bartho|lomew-eve.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="391" REF="424">
<P>The Anabapti&s;ts began now to increa&s;e in England. On Ea&s;ter-day, a Dutch congregation of them was di&s;|covered without Aldgate in London, whereof twenty|&s;even were taken and impri&s;oned; and four, bearing faggots at St. Paul's cro&s;s, &s;olemnly recanted their opi|nions. In the next month one Dutchman and ten women were condemned, of whom, one woman re|nounced her errors, eight were bani&s;hed, and two, the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, were burnt in Smithfield, where they died with great horror.</P>
<P>A. D. 1573.] One Peter Burchet, who had per|&s;uaded him&s;elf that it was lawful to kill any that had oppo&s;ed the truth of the go&s;pel, drew his dagger upon Hawkins, the famous navigator, in the open &s;treet, and wounded him, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be Hatton, who was then in great favour with the Queen. Being com|mitted to the Tower of London, he killed one of his keepers with a billet, which he &s;natched up out of the chimney; for which he was hanged, after having his right-hand cut off and nailed to the gallows.</P>
<P>A. D. 1575.] This year died, on the 17th of May, Parker, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. After the &s;ee had been vacant above half a year, Grindal Archbi&s;hop of York was preferred to it: but before he had pa&s;&s;ed through all the forms, and compleated his character, the convocation, after &s;everal prorogations, was re|a&s;&s;embled at St. Paul's, and, according to cu&s;tom, the Bi&s;hop of London was pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>A. D. 1576.] At the &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion, on February 17, this year, Grindal's tran&s;lation being perfected, he came into the convocation-hou&s;e at St. Paul's, and took the pre&s;ident&s;hip upon him&s;elf. There was no bu&s;ine&s;s done till the 17th of March, when the Arch|bi&s;hop ordered the reading of &s;everal articles, after|wards
<PB N="392" REF="425">&s;ub&s;cribed by both hou&s;es, relating to the regu|lation of the clergy.</P>
<P>A. D. 1577.] The Roman Catholic mi&s;&s;ionaries, &s;ent from the &s;eminaries beyond &s;ea, made &s;ome pro|gre&s;s in their undertaking, and drew off a great many people from going to church. To &s;top this defection from reformation, it was thought fit to impo&s;e a pecu|niary penalty on &s;uch as ab&s;ented them&s;elves from divine &s;ervice: but, there being no provi&s;ion by act of parli|ament, the legality of the method was debated. The judges, being &s;ummoned to give their opinion of the matter, re&s;olved, that, by the &s;tatute of the i&s;t of E|lizabeth, the commi&s;&s;ioners for eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es had authority to inflict any puni&s;hment, either amerciament, or otherwi&s;e, which the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws allowed of. The ground of their opinion was, becau&s;e all eccle&s;ia|&s;tical juri&s;diction and authority is by that &s;tatute an|nexed to the crown; and, by the &s;ame &s;tatute, her Maje&s;ty is impowered to commit this authority to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;he thinks proper to employ. Cuthbert Main, a Romi&s;h prie&s;t, was condemned and executed at Launce&s;ton in Cornwall; and Mr. Trugeon, who entertained him in his hou&s;e, was &s;entenced to perpe|tual impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>A. D. 1579.] A &s;ect called the Family of Love, grew &s;o numerous, that the Privy Council thought fit to endeavour their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. They per&s;uaded their followers, "That tho&s;e only were to be elected, and &s;aved, which were admitted into that family, and all the re&s;t reprobates and to be damned; and that it was lawful for them to deny, upon their oath, before a magi&s;trate, what&s;oever they li&s;t." They di&s;per&s;ed books among their followers, tran&s;lated from the Dutch tongue into Engli&s;h, which they intitled, <HI>The Go&s;pel of the Kingdom, Documental Sentences, the Prophecy of the Spirit of Love, and the publi&s;hing of Peace upon Earth.</HI> The author of the&s;e books was Henry Nicholas of Leyden, who bla&s;phemou&s;ly &s;aid,
<PB N="393" REF="426">"That he did partake of God, and God of his huma|nity." This man came over into England in the reign of Edward VI. and joined him&s;elf to the Dutch congre|gation at London, where he &s;educed many artificers and &s;illy women. Micronius and Charineus, then mini&s;ters of the Dutch congregation, zealou&s;ly con|futed his errors; but it &s;eems their antidotes did not take &s;uch effect as his poi&s;ons. To check the propo|gation of their tenets, a proclamation was publi&s;hed, that the civil magi&s;trate &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic, for the timely &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them, and that their books &s;hould be burnt.</P>
<P>The Queen was now treating of a marriage with the Duke of Anjou; which alliance was not agreeable to the Engli&s;h. The Puritans were loude&s;t in their re|mon&s;trances; and one Stubbs, a lawyer of that per|&s;ua&s;ion, wrote a book again&s;t the match, intitled, <HI>The gaping Gulph;</HI> which was penned with a great deal of heat and &s;atire. The Queen looked upon the&s;e intemperate clamourings as no better than arraigning the government. Therefore, to check this in&s;olence, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing the book, the au|thor, and printer. Stubbs was taken in a &s;ew days; and William Page, who di&s;per&s;ed the copies, and Sin|gleton the printer, were al&s;o apprehended. Stubbs and Page had their right-hands cut off with a cleaver, upon a &s;caffold in the market-place at We&s;tmin&s;ter; but the printer was pardoned. When Stubbs's right-hand was cut off, he li&s;ted off his hat with the other, exclaiming with a loud voice, "God &s;ave the Queen;" and the populace, in profound &s;ilence, te&s;tified their horror of the barbarity of the court, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the delinquent, who was a man of &s;ome note and unblemi&s;hed reputation.</P>
<P>This year Matthew Hammond, a plow-wright of Hetherfell near Norwich, was convened before the Bi&s;hop for here&s;y and bla&s;phemy. He denied the in|&s;piration of the New Te&s;tament, the divinity of our
<PB N="394" REF="427">Saviour and the Holy Gho&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ity of bapti&s;m, and the holy euchari&s;t. He abu&s;ed the Queen and council with opprobrious language, for which he was &s;en|tenced to lo&s;e his ears; and, per&s;i&s;ting in his here&s;ies and bla&s;phemous expre&s;&s;ions, he was, at la&s;t, burnt in the ca&s;tle-ditch at Norwich.</P>
<P>A. D. 1580.] Some Engli&s;h Je&s;uits, mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for learning and courage, were &s;ent over, this year, into England, for the conver&s;ion (as they call it) of the country. Among&s;t the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries, Robert Par&s;ons and Edmund Campion were the mo&s;t remark|able. The&s;e men, pro&s;ecuting their mi&s;&s;ion with great alacrity and vigour, prevailed with abundance of the common people, and &s;everal per&s;ons of learning and quality, to return to the communion of the church of Rome. They are &s;aid to have acted in a very &s;editi|ous manner: &s;ome of them being &s;o hardy as to affirm, that the crown belonged to the Queen of Scots; that Queen Elizabeth ought to be depo&s;ed; that if the Pope commanded one thing, and her Maje&s;ty the con|trary, his Holine&s;s was to be obeyed. To prevent the danger from &s;uch a mi&s;&s;ion, the Queen publi&s;hed a proclamation, commanding, that all tho&s;e who had children, relations, or wards, beyond the &s;ea, &s;hould certify their names to the ordinary, and recall them home within four months: and in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to return, not to &s;upply them with remittances, by bills of exchange, or any other way. They were likewi&s;e forbid to entertain or &s;upport any Je&s;uits or &s;eminary of prie&s;ts: and, when they knew where any &s;uch per&s;ons might be found, they were commanded to di&s;cover them, and put them into the magi&s;trates hands, under the penalties of being pro&s;ecuted as abettors of rebellion. That the &s;trictne&s;s of this order might not be &s;urpri&s;ing, the proclamation &s;ets forth, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries was not only to gain pro&s;elytes to their church, but to embroil the church, and draw off the peo|ple from their allegiance. Par&s;ons, a warm, rugged-tem|pered
<PB N="395" REF="428">man, was very bold and &s;editious in his di&s;cour&s;e; and went &s;uch extravagant lengths as to propo&s;e de|throning the Queen, in&s;omuch that &s;ome Roman Ca|tholics de&s;igned to &s;eize him, and deliver him to ju&s;tice. Campion, more mode&s;t, and of a &s;moother di&s;po&s;ition, offered to di&s;pute with the Engli&s;h clergy, and &s;ent them a public challenge. He likewi&s;e publi&s;h|ed his <HI>Decem rationes</HI> (ten rea&s;ons) in defence of the Ro|man communion, which was an&s;wered by Dr. White|aker.</P>
<P>A. D. 1581.] The Duke of Anjou, being now at the Engli&s;h court, continued to &s;olicit the marriage: as for the Queen, &s;he was willing to quiet the appre|hen&s;ions of the people, and &s;ilence the reports touch|ing the toleration of popery. For this purpo&s;e, after great importunity, &s;he con&s;ented to proceed to &s;ome extremities. Edmund Campion, the Je&s;uit, Ralph Sherwin, Luke Kirby, and Alexander Briant, prie&s;ts, were tried for high trea&s;on upon the &s;tatute of the 25th of Edward III. They were charged in the indictment with compa&s;&s;ing the Queen's death, and adhering to the Bi&s;hop of Rome; and that they came into England to rai&s;e a rebellion, and &s;ubvert the government. The jury brought them in guilty; and they were executed. Not long after &s;everal other Papi&s;ts &s;uffered upon the &s;ame &s;core. The nece&s;&s;ities of the times forced the Queen upon the&s;e &s;everities: for &s;he always declared her&s;elf aver&s;e to puni&s;hing people for con&s;cience &s;ake; but when principles and the Catholic religion were made a pretence for plotting and trea&s;on, &s;he was forced to &s;trike.</P>
<P>A. D. 1582.] The republic of Geneva, being appre|hen&s;ive of a &s;iege from the Duke of Savoy, &s;ent an agent to England for &s;upport. Their ca&s;e had been recommended to Wal&s;ingham by Brook the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris. Rea&s;ons of &s;tate, be&s;ides other con&s;iderations, &s;eem to have prevailed with the Queen to interpo&s;e in their behalf: and, &s;ince money was the
<PB N="396" REF="429">mo&s;t practicable way of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the council wrote to Archbi&s;hop Grindal to promote a contribution among&s;t the clergy. The Archbi&s;hop &s;ent moving letters to his &s;uffragans, and endeavoured to excite their com|pa&s;&s;ion from the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s of the Genevians. He likewi&s;e put them in mind, that this city de&s;erved &s;ome return for their former favours to the Engli&s;h Pro|te&s;tants.</P>
<P>A. D. 1583.] Grindal, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, having lo&s;t his &s;ight, was &s;omewhat di&s;abled for his function. He had formerly de&s;ired the Queen for leave to relinqui&s;h his charge and retire. This motion, though then refu&s;ed, was now thought rea&s;onable. However it does not appear that the re&s;ignation was perfected before his death, which happened in July, at Croydon. He was &s;ucceeded by John Whitgift, a Prelate of great learning and vigour, who was tran&s;lated from Worce&s;ter to Canterbury. At his fir&s;t coming to the &s;ee, he had &s;trict injunctions from Queen Eliza|beth, to hold a &s;trict rein, to pre&s;s the di&s;cipline of the church, and recover his province to uniformity. This method agreed with the Archbi&s;hop's &s;entiment, and was probably &s;ugge&s;ted by him&s;elf: for he in&s;i&s;ted &s;trongly upon the clergy's &s;ub&s;cribing the three articles, afterwards required by the canons pa&s;&s;ed in 1603; that is, "the Queen's eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy, the unex|ceptionablene&s;s of the prayer and ordinal, and that the nine and thirty articles are altogether agreeable to the word of God."</P>
<P>About this time one Robert Brown,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Ri&s;e of the Browni&s;ts.</NOTE> de|&s;cended of a con&s;iderable family in the county of Rutland, began to publi&s;h his he|terodoxies, and grow very trouble&s;ome. He was bred in Bennet college in Cambridge, fell into Cartwright's opinions, and at la&s;t went much farther in his &s;ingu|larities. He was extravagantly &s;atyrical again&s;t the church of England. In his di&s;cour&s;es, he &s;aid, that her government was Antichri&s;tian, her &s;acraments
<PB N="397" REF="430">clogged with &s;uper&s;tition, that the liturgy had a mix|ture of popery and pagani&s;m in it; and that the mi&s;&s;i|on of the clergy was no better than that of Baal's prie&s;ts in the Old Te&s;tament. And now, believing him&s;elf obliged to go out of Babylon, he went to Zealand, and joined Cartwright's congregation at Mid|dleburgh: but even there finding fault with Cart|wright's &s;cheme, he re&s;olved to produce &s;omething more perfect from his own invention. His model was drawn in a book, intitled, <HI>A treati&s;e of reformation,</HI> whch had been printed the preceding year at Middle|burgh. Having &s;ent as many copies of it into Eng|land as he thought nece&s;&s;ary, he came over &s;oon after him&s;elf. At this time the Dutch had a numerous congregation at Norwich; many of whom inclining to Anabapti&s;m, were the more di&s;po&s;ed to entertain any new opinions. Brown made his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay among them; and after having made &s;ome progre&s;s, and rai&s;ed him&s;elf a character for zeal and &s;anctity, he began to tamper with the Engli&s;h, taking in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Richard Harri&s;on, a country &s;chool ma&s;ter. At length he formed churches of both nations, but mo&s;tly Engli&s;h: and in&s;tructed his audience, that the church of Eng|land was no true church; that there was little of Chri&s;t's in&s;titution in the public mini&s;trations, and that all good Chri&s;tians were obliged to &s;eparate from tho&s;e impure a&s;&s;emblies; that their next &s;tep was to join him and his di&s;ciples; that here was nothing but what was pure and unexceptionable, evidently in&s;pired by the Spirit of God, and refined from all alloy and profana|tion. Brown di&s;per&s;ed his books in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom: but the government was far from conniving at the&s;e liberties; for Elias Thacker and John Cop|ping were indicted this &s;ummer, for di&s;per&s;ing the&s;e pamphlets, brought in guilty of felony, and executed at St. Edmund's Bury. Brown, the author, was more favourably dealt with than either of the&s;e criminals: though, being convened before Edmund Freke Bi&s;hop
<PB N="398" REF="431">of Norwich, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners, he not only maintained his &s;chi&s;m, but mi&s;behaved him|&s;elf to the court, upon which he was committed to the cu&s;tody of the Sheriff of Norwich. However, the Lord Trea&s;urer Burleigh, being his near relation, pro|cured his enlargement; and, after he had &s;uffered a good deal by his ob&s;tinacy, he conformed &s;o far as to take a benefice in Northampton&s;hire. But, though he conformed him&s;elf, it was not in his power to clo&s;e the &s;chi&s;m. Many of his followers continued unre|claimed, and &s;uffered death for their mi&s;per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Puritans were not without great men in their intere&s;t: among&s;t whom may be reckoned the Earls of Huntingdon and Leice&s;ter, Roger Lord North, Sir Francis Knolles, and Secretary Wal&s;ing|ham: but as for the Queen, &s;he had no good opinion of the Di&s;&s;enters. They maintained &s;ome uncourtly doctrine, as it was then reckoned: they confined her Maje&s;ty's &s;upremacy to temporal juri&s;diction: they did not care&s;s her prerogative, nor &s;tretch her empire far enough into the church. This made her cold to inter|ce&s;&s;ion, and di&s;abled their patrons from doing them much &s;ervice: and to prevent importunities of this kind, &s;he referred eccle&s;ia&s;tical bu&s;ine&s;s entirely to Whitgift's management. This Prelate acted vigorou&s;|ly, and an&s;wered the confidence put in him. The great men at court who favoured the Puritans, finding the Archbi&s;hop countenanced by the Queen, and him|&s;elf a per&s;on of &s;uch re&s;olution, did not think fit to en|gage their character, and ri&s;que their fortunes by an open oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>As the Di&s;&s;enters were trouble&s;ome on one hand, &s;o on the other &s;ome bigotted Papi&s;ts engaged in de&s;perate de&s;igns. John Somerville, a Warwick&s;hire gentle|man, heated to rage and di&s;traction by &s;ome &s;canda|lous pamphlets, made his way privately towards the Queen's apartment, a&s;&s;aulted one or two with his drawn &s;word, and, being apprehended, confe&s;&s;ed that
<PB N="399" REF="432">he intended to kill the Queen. Though this man was apparently frantic, one Edward Arden, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of the &s;ame county, Arden's wife, their daughter married to Somerville, and one Hall a prie&s;t, were arraigned at Guildhall, and brought in quality of high trea&s;on upon the evidence of this lunatic. About three days after, Somerville &s;trangled him&s;elf in the pri&s;on; and Arden was drawn, hanged and quartered, but the women and the prie&s;t were pardoned.</P>
<P>A. D. 1584.] The parliament met this year No|vember 23, and an act pa&s;&s;ed for obliging Roman Catholic prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, who practi&s;ed &s;ometimes again&s;t the &s;tate upon the excommunicating bull of Pope Pius V. to depart the kingdom within forty days, and not to return under the penalty of high trea&s;on. The convocation met the day after the par|liament, in which little was done be&s;ides granting a &s;ub&s;idy. On the 18th of December, John Hilton, clerk, who had been impri&s;oned by the high commi&s;|&s;ion for error, here&s;y, and bla&s;phemy, was ordered to be convened. He appeared on the twenty-&s;econd, and confe&s;&s;ed the accu&s;ation; and that, in a &s;ermon at St. Martin's in the Felds, he had affirmed that the Old and New Te&s;taments are but fables; that he had bla&s;phemed our Saviour, and declared him&s;elf a Hea|then. After this he gave in his abjuration in writing: upon which &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, penance was injoined him, and he was ordered to make a &s;olemn recantation in St. Martin's church, the convocatioon being pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A. D. 1585.] An a&s;&s;embly of the di&s;&s;enters had met at the &s;ame time as the parliament and convoca|tion, but the certain place of their meeting was not known. Their agents had con&s;tantly attended the parliament-hou&s;e, &s;trongly &s;oliciting their bu&s;ine&s;s. What impre&s;&s;ion they made may appear by a letter to her Maje&s;ty, from Archbi&s;hop Whitgift, wherein he complaineth of &s;everal bills that had, the day before the date of his letter, pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of Commons,
<PB N="400" REF="433">in favour of the non-conformi&s;ts, about marrying at all times in the year, concerning eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and epi&s;copal vi&s;itations. This letter either found or made the Queen of the Archbi&s;hop's &s;entiment; for the bills and debates in the lower hou&s;e come to no|thing, and no alteration pa&s;&s;ed upon the di&s;cipline of the church this &s;e&s;&s;ion. On the twenty ninth of March the Queen made a &s;peech to both hou&s;es at the proro|gation of the parliament. She takes notice that &s;ome people have been bu&s;y in finding faults with the clergy; that a cen&s;ure of this kind reflected upon her&s;elf: for &s;ince God had made her an over-ruler of the church, her negligence could not be excu&s;ed, if any &s;chi&s;m or here&s;y was connived at. She grants-there may be &s;ome mi&s;behaviour and omi&s;&s;ion among&s;t the body of the clergy; and that &s;uch mi&s;carriage is common to all con&s;iderable offices. "All which (continue her Ma|je&s;ty) if you, my Lords of the clegy, do not amend, I mean to depo&s;e you. Look well therefore to your charge." The di&s;&s;enters, failing of &s;ucce&s;s in the parliament hou&s;e, were &s;omewhat di&s;couraged. Cart|wright him&s;elf, their leading man, was now willing to come to an accommodation, and made u&s;e of the Earl of Leice&s;ter to mediate with the Archbi&s;hop to that effect, as appears by letters that pa&s;&s;ed between the Archbi&s;hop and that nobleman, in July, this year. A pre&s;bytery was &s;et up this year at Hatfield Peveril in E&s;&s;ex, by one Carew, a Puritan preacher. Ailmer Bi&s;hop of London being informed of it, &s;ummoned the preacher and &s;everal of the congregation before him&s;elf, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners. The&s;e men, after examination, were committed. As for Carew, his ignorance, heterodoxies, and a&s;&s;urance, were very remarkable. He had his mi&s;&s;ion only from the people's election, de&s;pi&s;ed all cen&s;ures of the church, declaimed again&s;t the common prayer, and denied Chri&s;t's de&s;cent into hell. He maintained, that divi&s;ions were nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e our Saviour &s;aid,
<PB N="401" REF="434">"I came not to &s;end peace, but a &s;word." He held that "the &s;oul of man was part of the &s;ub&s;tance of God;" by con&s;equence, that the &s;oul was infinite, and that the Deity mu&s;t &s;uffer in the fate of tho&s;e that were lo&s;t. He had mi&s;led his people to an indifferency for the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m: they &s;aid, "It made no matter for the water, as they had the word."</P>
<P>A. D. 1586.] This year is remarkable for the un|precedented trial of Mary Queen of Scots, brought about by the indi&s;cretion of her friends, and the jealous fears of Queen Elizabeth; who, to the in|delible &s;ullying of her character, permitted the &s;en|tence to be executed upon that unfortunate Prince&s;s, in Fotheringhay ca&s;tle, the year following, after &s;he had been pri&s;oner in England nineteen years, having fled thither for protection from her own rebellious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>A. D. 1587.] Conformity was now pre&s;&s;ed to the height. The power of the high commi&s;&s;ion began to extend far, and penalties to fall heavy on offenders: whereupon the di&s;&s;enters much oppo&s;ed it in their writings, &s;ome que&s;tioning the court as not warranted by law; others taxing their proceedings as exceeding their commi&s;&s;ion. But the mo&s;t general exception again&s;t the high commi&s;&s;ion was, the proceeding <HI>ex officio mero,</HI> by way of inquiry again&s;t &s;uch whom they &s;u&s;pected: it being conceived unju&s;t, that, in ca&s;es criminal, a party &s;hould be forced to di&s;cover what might be penal to him&s;elf. The lawfulne&s;s of this oath was learnedly canva&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides. Be|cau&s;e many que&s;tioned the authority of the high com|mi&s;&s;ion, Archbi&s;hop Whitgift &s;o contrived the matter, that the principal Non-conformi&s;ts (e&s;pecially if they had any vi&s;ible e&s;tates) were brought into the &s;tar|chamber, the power whereof was undi&s;puted; where &s;ome of them, be&s;ides impri&s;onment, had very heavy fines laid upon them. And, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the
<PB N="402" REF="435">Queen's council were pre&s;ent at the cen&s;ures, this took off the odium from the Archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>A. D. 1588.] This year is famous for the de&s;truc|tion of the <HI>Invincible Armada,</HI> fitted out by the King of Spain, in order to invade England. For the happy event of this affair Queen Elizabeth appointed prayers and thank&s;givings over all the churches in England. The Queen with a great train of the nobility came to St. Paul's church (where the banners taken from the enemy were di&s;played) and there, in a mo&s;t humble manner, gave thanks to Almighty God, the giver of all victory. About this time many libels flew abroad, the main drift of which was to defame the Engli&s;h prelates, and render them odious to the common people, and to introduce the Geneva di&s;cipline. The&s;e libels were &s;tuffed with &s;uch &s;candalous, virulent, and abu&s;ive language, as could &s;carce be imagined to drop from the mouth or pen of a Chri&s;tian, and yet they were the work of &s;ome mini&s;ters and lay pro&s;elytes pretending to an uncommon purity and preci&s;ene&s;s in religion. This year al&s;o the Popi&s;h clergy &s;et forth a book, called <HI>the admonition,</HI> di&s;per&s;ed among the Pa|pi&s;ts, and much extolled. But the defeat of the Armada happening &s;oon after its publication, Par&s;ons procured the whole impre&s;&s;ion to be burnt (except &s;ome few &s;ent abroad to his friends) that it might not remain a monument of their fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>A. D. 1589.] The convocation met at St. Paul's this year on November 13, but there was nothing done, be&s;ides granting two &s;ub&s;idies, till the beginning of March, when the Archbi&s;hop brought in certain orders to be ob&s;erved through the whole province. 1. That &s;ingle bene&s;iced men &s;hould be obliged to con&s;tant re&s;idence; but with an exception of liberty for prebendaries, and chaplains to the King or Peers. There was likewi&s;e a &s;aving for tho&s;e who were allowed non-re&s;idence by act of parliament. However, in the&s;e ca&s;es, they &s;hould be compelled to keep a licen&s;ed
<PB N="403" REF="436">preaching curate. 2. Double beneficed men were to re&s;ide equal proportions of time upon their re&s;pective livings, and to provide a licen&s;ed curate where they are ab&s;ent. 3. Beneficed men ab&s;ent an hundred and thirty days, were to keep licen&s;ed curates. 4. Scan|dalous mini&s;ters, guilty of notorious crimes, mu&s;t be removed, and never admitted into any cure. 5. Un|learned mini&s;ters, unqualified to catechi&s;e, are barred admi&s;&s;ion to any cure. 6. None &s;hall be allowed to place or di&s;place a curate without authority from the Archbi&s;hop or Bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e. The&s;e orders were agreed to by both hou&s;es, who promi&s;ed to obey and execute them.</P>
<P>A. D. 1590.] This year Thomas Cartwright, Bat|chelor, of Divinity, was brought before the Queen's com|mi&s;&s;ioners for eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and the oath <HI>ex officio</HI> tendered to him, to an&s;wer divers articles ob|jected again&s;t him. Every one of the commi&s;&s;ioners a&s;&s;ured him, upon their credit, that, by the laws of the realm, he was obliged to take the oath, and an|&s;wer the que&s;tions put to him. But Cartwright de|&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, and told them he thought the laws of God brought him under no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity. Upon this non-compliance he was committed to the Fleet, to which pri&s;on &s;everal of his brethren had been &s;ent &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>A. D. 1591.] About this time one Hacket, an illi|terate, in&s;olent, debauched fellow, who, having &s;pent his &s;ub&s;tance in riotous living, had put on a demure face and turned Puritan, praying <HI>extempore,</HI> keeping Sunday fa&s;ts, and boa&s;ting of conflicts with Satan, en|gaged in a wild enterpri&s;e for promoting the Geneva di&s;cipline. Wiggington, a puritanical preacher, made him acquainted with Coppinger and Arthington, both alike enthu&s;ia&s;tical pretenders to a divine call and &s;u|pernatural revelations. They formed a charge of trea|&s;on again&s;t Archbi&s;hop Whitgift, and Sir Chri&s;topher Hatton the Lord Chancellor; threatened to di&s;patch
<PB N="404" REF="437">them; publi&s;hed &s;editious papers and ballads to in|cite the mob to an in&s;urrection; and pretended to have a power to dethrone the Queen (who&s;e picture Hacket had &s;tabbed with a dagger) if &s;he would not encourage their projected reformation. Hacket, having per&s;uaded Coppinger and Arthington, that they had more than a prophetical &s;pirit in them, and were angelical vi|&s;ioners, &s;et up him&s;elf for Chri&s;t, or at lea&s;t for a King, informed by the &s;ame divine &s;pirit, and partaker of his glorified nature, come down from heaven to plant the go&s;pel through Europe, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a church-di&s;cipline in England. This was, by Cop|pinger and Arthington, who called them&s;elves his two prophets, proclaimed through the &s;treets of Lon|don, affirming it on their &s;alvation, and declaring, "that Hacket was the &s;upreme Monarch of the world; that all the Princes of Europe held their &s;cep|ters of him; and that the Queen was to be depo&s;ed." They were &s;oon apprehended, and behaved them&s;elves with intolerable in&s;olence before the council. Hac|ket, being tried for trea&s;on, and confe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf guilty, was condemned; and uttered the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing bla&s;phemous and trea&s;onable expre&s;&s;ions at his ex|ecution. Coppinger &s;tarved him&s;elf to death in pri&s;on: but Arthington lived to repent, made a formal recan|tion, and became an object of the Queen's mercy. The Puritans were at this time bu&s;y in exclaiming and writing again&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts: but the Queen, knowing their view was to undermine the di&s;cipline of the church, and to wound her prerogative through the &s;ides of the hierarchy, repre&s;&s;ed their mea&s;ures; and keeping a &s;trict hand over them, obliged them for a time to be quiet. The Papi&s;ts too, on occa&s;ion of an Engli&s;h &s;eminary's being founded at Valladolid, were put in mind of the laws forbidding them to &s;end their children to &s;uch places of education, which they had lately done in more than ordinary numbers: and, for the more effectual di&s;covery of this practice, a
<PB N="405" REF="438">proclamation was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t Je&s;uits and &s;eminary prie&s;ts, "forbidding all per&s;ons, throughout the realm, to lodge or harbour any man whatever, except they fir&s;t enquired who he was, whether he frequented the &s;ervice of the church, what e&s;tate he had to live on, where he re&s;ided the year before," and into other the like circum&s;tances. To provide a more proper place for the education of her Iri&s;h &s;ubjects, the Queen this year founded a college in Dublin, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, endowing it with a power of con|ferring degrees, and other privileges of an univer&s;ity; which hath &s;ince produced many eminent and learned men, who have done &s;ervice to religion, and no &s;mall honour to their country.</P>
<P>A. D. 1592.] Upwards of 10,000 died in London this year of the plague, Mr. Udel was indicted, and arraigned, at Croydon, for defaming the Queen, and her government, in a book he had publi&s;hed. He pleaded not guilty, denying him&s;elf to be the author of the book. The jury brought him in guilty: but he was remanded to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea. In the March following he was brought again to the bar, at the a&s;&s;izes held in Southwark, and was there condemned to be executed for a felon: but the execution was prevented by his death, without any other &s;ickne&s;s except that occa&s;ioned by &s;orrow.</P>
<P>A. D. 1593.] In the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, which ended this year, on April, by di&s;&s;olution, an act pa&s;&s;ed "for retaining the Queen's &s;ubjects in their due obedience;" de&s;igned chiefly again&s;t the Roman Catholics, but likewi&s;e affecting the Puritans, whom the Queen, &s;ince their &s;etting up a form of di&s;cipline and government in oppo&s;ition to the laws and the royal authority, was de&s;irous more than ever to &s;up|pre&s;s. In her vi&s;it the la&s;t year to the univer&s;ity of Oxford, where &s;he received a &s;plendid treat from the Lord Buckhur&s;t their Chancellor, and was entertained with &s;peeches, plays, and academical exerci&s;es, much
<PB N="406" REF="439">to her &s;atisfaction, &s;he had advi&s;ed them, "to be careful to &s;erve God, not with the novel and fanta&s;ti|cal devotion practi&s;ed by &s;ome, but according to the laws of God and the land; not to outrun the laws, but follow them; not to di&s;pute the fitne&s;s or obliga|tion thereof, but &s;incerely obey &s;uch as were in force, and &s;ubmit to their &s;uperiors; and la&s;tly, to pre&s;erve peace, union, and concord, among them&s;elves." By the act now made, "all per&s;ons, above the age of &s;ixteen, ab&s;enting them&s;elves from church for a month, or by printing, writing, or words, per&s;uading others to do &s;o, were to be impri&s;oned, till they conformed, and made an open declaration of their conformity, ac|cording to a form pre&s;cribed; if they did not conform within three months after their conviction, they were to abjure the realm; and, if they either refu&s;ed to make &s;uch abjuration, or did not go abroad within the time limited for their departure, they were to &s;uffer as felons, without benefit of clergy." The harbour|ing or relieving offenders, and the re&s;ort to conventi|cles, were likewi&s;e forbidden. The favourers of the Puritans had not now credit or power enough at court to prevent the execution of this and other laws. Henry Barrow, a gentleman; and John Greenwood, a prie&s;t, were condemned and executed at Tyburn, for writing certain &s;editious pamphlets: and &s;oon after John Penry, a Welchman, was arraigned and condemned of fe|lony, at the King's Bench bar, for being a principal penner and publi&s;her of a libel, called <HI>Martin Mar|prelate,</HI> and executed.</P>
<P>A. D. 1594.] This year died at Rome Cardinal William Allen, and was buried in the church of the Engli&s;h college. He was much regretted by the Ca|tholics: for, be&s;ides the &s;ervice of his pen, he kept the Engli&s;h Papi&s;ts from breaking out into mi&s;under|&s;tandings, and made up the differences between the &s;ecular prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits.</P>
<PB N="407" REF="440">
<P>A. D. 1595.] There aro&s;e great debates among the reformed concerning the doctrines of prede&s;tination, free-will, the force of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the extent of redemption. A more &s;olemn and &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day, throughout England, commenced about this time, occa&s;ioned by a book wrote and pu|bli&s;hed by Dr. Bound.</P>
<P>A. D. 1596.] Richard Fletcher, Bi&s;hop of London, departed this life. He is &s;aid to have taken the &s;ee of Bri&s;tol upon terms of compliance, clo&s;ed with foul pro|po&s;als, and almo&s;t &s;eculari&s;ed the &s;ee, by letting lea&s;es upon incon&s;iderable rents re&s;erved. He mi&s;managed, in the &s;ame manner, upon his tran&s;lation to London. John Coldwell, Doctor of Phy&s;ic, and Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;|bury, died about the &s;ame time. He proved a very unfortunate prelate to the bi&s;hopric. In this reign, it was the method of &s;ome courtiers to look out for churchmen unfurni&s;hed with merit or hone&s;ty, and pre|fer them for tools to their avarice. Coldwell happen|ing to be thus qualified, Sir Walter Raleigh made u&s;e of the opportunity, and obtained Sherborn ca&s;tle, with the manor, park, &amp;c. To make his de&s;ign bear, he &s;olicited the Queen to give way to the alienation; and having got over that difficulty, the remaining part was ea&s;y enough; for Coldwell, either out of cowardice or covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;eems to have re&s;igned without &s;truggle. The Bi&s;hop, who, it is to be hoped, repented his bar|gain, died a beggar. And as for Sir Walter, it was thought by &s;uper&s;titious people, that this forbidden &s;eizure overlaid his pro&s;perity, and made him &s;ink with his &s;acrilege.</P>
<P>A. D. 1597.] In October this winter the parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in which two acts pa&s;&s;ed relating to the church. By one of them, the deprivation of the Bi&s;hops who refu&s;ed to comply with the reforma|tion is confirmed; and all Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, and Deans, promoted by the Queen to their re&s;pective dig|nities and &s;tations, from any time &s;ince her acce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="408" REF="441">to the throne to the 10th of November, in the fourth year of her reign, are declared lawfully con&s;tituted. The rea&s;on of making this act was, as the preamble &s;ets forth, becau&s;e the parties deprived made &s;ecret ap|peals, and u&s;ed other clande&s;tine methods to &s;upport their claim and preten&s;ions. The other act, concern|ing the church, was, <HI>the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bi&s;hopric of Norwich, and the revenues belonging to it, again&s;t a pre|tended concealed title.</HI> A bill for relieving the poor out of impropriations was twice read in the hou&s;e of Com|mons, and, after &s;ome controver&s;y, was thrown out. The parliament was di&s;&s;olved on the 9th of February following.</P>
<P>A D. 1598.] This year the celebrated Sir Edward Coke, and Elizabeth, relict of Sir William Hatton, marrying without banns or licence, Henry Bothwell prie&s;t, rector of Okeover, who married them, and &s;e|veral per&s;ons of condition pre&s;ent at the wedding, were pro&s;ecuted in the Archbi&s;hop's court, although the lady was grand-daughter of Lord Burleigh, the Queen's favourite, and Lord Trea&s;urer; but, upon their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion by their proxies, were ab&s;olved from the cen|&s;ures incurred. The <HI>in&s;trument</HI> &s;ets forth, that, by their overlooking the authority of the church, they had all of them fallen under the greater excommunication, and the con&s;equent penalties. About this time one Ed|ward Squire was tried, condemned, and executed, for attempting the lives of the Queen and the Earl of E&s;|&s;ex, by &s;prinkling a poi&s;onous powder on the pummel of her Maje&s;ty's &s;addle, and on his Lord&s;hip's chair. He had been per&s;uaded to undertake this villainy by one Walpole a Je&s;uit in Spain, who had furni&s;hed him with the poi&s;on; and thinking that Squire had decei|ved him, as the Queen and E&s;&s;ex continued in good health, &s;ent over a per&s;on to inform again&s;t him.</P>
<P>A. D. 1601.] The convocation met this year on October 8; and the Archbi&s;hop pre&s;iding, exhorted the Bi&s;hops to manage with vigilance and vigour, and
<PB N="409" REF="442">be careful to ob&s;erve the canons pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t con|vocation. His Grace particularly gave them the &s;ol|lowing lowing cautions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Not to proceed in court upon ap|paritors &s;ugge&s;tions, without churchwardens pre&s;ent|ment, or other ju&s;t inqui&s;ition:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges hold no more than one court in the &s;pace of five weeks:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That chancellors and officials do not call men to &s;everal courts for the &s;ame cau&s;e:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To have bills of pre&s;entment but once a quarter:</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the curates of non-re&s;idents be able per&s;ons, and have good allowances:</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That none but Chancellors grant li|cences for marriage.</ITEM>

<P>The difference betwixt the &s;eculars and the Je&s;uits &s;till continuing and increa&s;ing, Bi&s;hop Bancroft af|forded the &s;eculars countenance and maintenance in London hou&s;e, furni&s;hing them with nece&s;&s;aries to write again&s;t their adver&s;aries, hoping the Prote&s;tants might a&s;&s;ault the Romi&s;h cau&s;e with the greater advan|tage by the breach made by their own di&s;&s;entions.</P>
<P>In the parliament this year, it was enacted, that over&s;eers of the poor &s;hould be nominated yearly, in Ea&s;ter week, under the hand and &s;eal of two ju&s;tices of the peace; and that the&s;e, with the churchwardens, &s;hould take care of the poor, binding out apprentices, &amp;c. as al&s;o that the Lord Chancellor &s;hould award commi&s;&s;ions under the great &s;eal into any part of the realm, to the Bi&s;hop of every dioce&s;e, and his Chan|cellor, &amp;c. to inquire by oaths of twelve men into the mi&s;employment of any lands or goods given to pious u&s;es.</P>
<P>A. D. 1602.] About this time Pope Clement VIII. perceiving the di&s;putes between the Engli&s;h Je&s;uits and &s;eculars was like to injure the Papal intere&s;t, wrote to the arch-prie&s;t Blackwell to &s;top the progre&s;s of the con|te&s;t; to call in all defamatory books, and not to &s;uf|fer either party to maltreat the other; and that they &s;hould print nothing upon the controver&s;y without a licence from the Cardinal Protector. A proclamation
<PB N="410" REF="443">was i&s;&s;ued in October, ordering all the Je&s;uits, with &s;uch &s;eculars as adhered to them, to depart the realm immediately; and the more moderate of the &s;ecular prie&s;ts to be gone likewi&s;e, unle&s;s they would take the oath of allegiance. Camden repre&s;ents the publi&s;hing of this proclamation as a kind of providence; &s;ince it prevented &s;ome dangerous practices of Winter and Te&s;mond, Je&s;uits, who had been &s;ent from Spain to take mea&s;ures for murdering the Queen, and exclu|ding the King of Scotland from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A. D. 1603.] Elizabeth, who had all along been very happy in her health, now began to decline very &s;en&s;ibly. Her illne&s;s began to make a noi&s;e in the month of February: &s;he had no formed fever, and her pul&s;e was good; but &s;he eat very little, could not &s;leep, and had a burning heat in her &s;tomach, with a perpetual thir&s;t and clammine&s;s in her mouth, which made her drink frequently, to prevent being choaked by the dry and hot phlegm. She had u&s;ed to be care|ful of her health; but now &s;he would take nothing, and refu&s;ed all the medicines pre&s;cribed by her phy&s;i|cians, declaring "&s;he wi&s;hed to die, and would live no longer." All agreed, that a deep melancholy, too &s;trong to be either a&s;&s;uaged or diverted, was the cau&s;e of her illne&s;s; and it appeared in her looks and actions before &s;he was &s;eized with it. It was now time for her to declare her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; a point &s;he had always avoid|ed, though &s;he never varied in her re&s;olution of tran&s;|mitting the crown to the King of Scotland. Some days before her decea&s;e, &s;he told the Lord Admiral and Cecil in confidence, "that the crown of England was held by Kings &s;ucceeding in the order of their de&s;cent; that it ought not to go to riffraff mortals, but to her next immediate heir; and &s;he owned no &s;ucce&s;&s;or but the King of Scotland." The&s;e noblemen, on the day before her death, when her &s;peech had failed, putting her in mind of what &s;he had told them, and de&s;iring her, in the pre&s;ence of other Lords of the council, to
<PB N="411" REF="444">&s;hew &s;ome &s;ign of her confirming what &s;he had &s;aid to them, &s;he accordingly put her hand upon her head, in token of her approbation. There was no great danger of any di&s;pute about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the war with Spain having much hindered the intrigues of that court in fa|vour of the Infanta, and there being no nobleman in England qualified, by his courage, ambition, under|&s;tanding, and credit, to be the head of a party, except the Earl of Northumberland, who was heartily enga|ged in King James's party. The Queen continued in a deplorable condition, &s;itting pen&s;ive for ten days to|gether on cu&s;hions, without an hour's re&s;t in all the time, till, on March 21, &s;he was put into bed by force; and though &s;he then &s;eemed to be better, &s;he &s;till lay on her &s;ide, without &s;peaking to or regarding any body. The Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury attending her on this occa&s;ion, &s;he heard his exhortations, and joined in his prayers, with &s;eeming great humility and devotion. On the 23d of that month &s;he was &s;peech|le&s;s all the day; and having in the night got a conti|nued &s;leep of five hours,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Elizabeth's death and charac|ter.</NOTE> waked only to die, in the calme&s;t manner, and al|mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly, about two o'clock next morning, in the 70th year of her age, and the 45th of her reign. Her corp&s;e, without being opened or embalmed, was removed, on March 28, from Richmond to Whitehall; but her Maje&s;ty having given orders that it &s;hould not be touched or &s;een after her decea&s;e by any per&s;on but her own wo|men, no body was &s;uffered to &s;ee it; and it was inter|red on Thur&s;day, April 28, in the chapel of Henry VII. in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, with great magnificence. Elizabeth, as to her per&s;on, was well made, hand|&s;ome, &s;trong limbed, rather tall than middle-&s;ized; her forehead high and round, her eyes brown and lively, her complexion fair, her hair of a lighti&s;h yel|low, her fingers long and taper, her voice clear and &s;hrill; &s;he had a fine &s;et of teeth, and her outward
<PB N="412" REF="445">form was much &s;et off by an air that was very agree|able. After &s;he came to the throne, whether &s;he grew fonder of her own figure, or thought that Maje&s;ty re|quired a &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of apparel, &s;he laid a&s;ide that negligence which before &s;he u&s;ed in that re&s;pect, and wore con&s;tantly a dre&s;s exceeding rich, which &s;he va|ried according to the different fa&s;hions of Europe, as &s;he fancied they be&s;t became her; a point &s;he was very &s;olicitous about. This humour did not leave her when &s;he was pa&s;t her grand climacteric; &s;he dre&s;&s;ed in her old age like a young girl; and &s;till &s;hone in her jewels, diamonds, and other precious &s;tones, afraid of nothing &s;o much as of being thought old: &s;he liked flattery, e&s;pecially on the &s;ubject of her beauty, however ful&s;ome it appeared to every body el&s;e; was fond of being courted; and did not ea&s;ily quit her favourites. Her memory was &s;o good, that &s;he never forgot any body &s;he had once &s;een, and ea&s;ily made her&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of various languages, ancient and modern, of the Greek and Dutch, &s;o as to under&s;tand them well, and of the Latin, French, Italian, and Spani&s;h, &s;o as to &s;peak them fluently. She had an admirable under&s;tanding, ready wit, great penetration, and a &s;olid judgment. Her abilities for government were never que&s;tioned by any one; her application to public affairs was extraor|dinary: but her prudence was in many ca&s;es the ef|fect of a low cunning, and of the diffidence or jealou&s;y of her nature, and her mea&s;ures were often &s;uch as mo|rality could not approve of, however politics might re|pre&s;ent them as nece&s;&s;ary. A profound di&s;&s;imulation reigned in all her conduct and profe&s;&s;ions; nobody un|der&s;tood the art better, or practi&s;ed it more con&s;tantly. She had no notion of genero&s;ity or magnanimity: nor was &s;he, by inclination, either beneficent or magnifi|cent; and, in a few in&s;tances, where &s;he affected to appear &s;o, her actions proceeded either from a view of intere&s;t, or for making a figure, and rai&s;ing a reputa|tion
<PB N="413" REF="446">abroad. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of Eng|land, the reformation of the coin, the re&s;toring of the naval force of the kingdom, the encouragement of commerce, the defeat of the invincible armada, and the reducing the formidable power of Spain, were the di&s;tingui&s;hing glories of her reign. Though &s;he was &s;ometimes obliged to a&s;&s;ert her prerogative, &s;he treated her parliaments generally in an endearing manner, got from them all the &s;upplies &s;he wanted; and engaged them to bear the odium of the mo&s;t cruel and arbitrary acts of her government, which, how evi|dently &s;oever the effect of her own private pa&s;&s;ions and malevolence, &s;he would fain have thought to be done purely for the &s;ake of her &s;ubjects and the &s;afety of the kingdom. Her conduct towards the nobility was very different; jealous of their power, &s;he employed very few of them in places of any tru&s;t or profit, and &s;till fewer in her coun|cils. Her choleric temper, which &s;he indulged even in conferences with foreign amba&s;&s;adors &s;o, that they had no way of treating with her, but by bearing them ea&s;ily, and flattering her in her humour, and which carried her to &s;uch violences, that the Ladies of her bed-chamber, and her maids of honour, often felt the weight of her hand, was perhaps another rea|&s;on why &s;he did not care to employ the nobility: they were not tame enough in tho&s;e days to bear &s;uch out|rages. Her council was chiefly compo&s;ed of per&s;ons rai&s;ed by her&s;elf from an ordinary &s;tation in life, upon whom &s;he could lay the blame of any odious action, and who would be more ob&s;equious to her will; the&s;e were the men of her confidence, e&s;pecially Burleigh and his &s;on Sir Robert Cecil; to whom, whatever favourites &s;he had, the whole management of affairs, from the beginning to the end of her reign, was intru&s;ted. The ordinary way of rai&s;ing fortunes for the&s;e privy-coun|&s;ellors was by plundering the church, and granting

Corruption in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was much greater in her time, than it had been former|ly; the u&s;e of tortures to extort confe&s;&s;ions of what the examiner plea&s;ed to &s;ugge&s;t to the &s;uppo&s;ed criminals; the new kind of proofs allowed in courts for evidence to convict per&s;ons accu&s;ed; the great encouragement given to informers; the &s;pies planted in the families of the nobility and gentry, rendering their lives uncom|fortable, and expo&s;ing them to continual dangers from their own &s;ervants; the number of pur&s;uivants, roving from place to place, to watch people's words, and to take up all they were plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect; the patents for di&s;covering the concealed lands of the crown, abu&s;ed by the patentees to rob the church of its rights, and harra&s;s the gentry; and the va&s;t multitude of penal laws pa&s;&s;ed in her reign, more than in any of her pre|dece&s;&s;ors, will ever be deemed a reproach to her go|vernment. The &s;eries of fal&s;hoods, hypocrify, and cruelty, appearing in all her conduct towards Mary Queen of Scotland, particularly in &s;igning the warrant for her execution (though, all things con&s;idered, it was perhaps the gentle&s;t part of that Prince&s;s's treat|ment, who&s;e fortitude under her &s;ufferings, and e&s;pe|cially at her death, contributed exceedingly to her glory, and to wipe off the load of infamy which had been &s;o maliciou&s;ly and unju&s;tly thrown upon her) will be an eternal blot upon her memory. Elizabeth par|doned rarely, and puni&s;hed &s;everely; being in her nature unforgiving, and inexorable. Her defects of mind were tho&s;e for which the Tudor family was re|markable; &s;he was Henry VIII. in a female garb, actu|ated by the &s;ame pride, the &s;ame furious tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame mi&s;tru&s;tful, jealous, and revengeful temper, the &s;ame wilfulne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy, and the &s;ame avarice. It was this la&s;t pa&s;&s;ion which made her fond of getting money any way, that would not di&s;gu&s;t the body
<PB N="415" REF="450">of her &s;ubjects; every New-year's-day &s;he received above 60,000 crowns in gifts and pre&s;ents; and, when Sir Francis Drake was fighting for her &s;ervice, in the la&s;t voyage he made to America, where he died, &s;he &s;eized a &s;um of 15,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he had left in the Lord Mayor of London's keeping. Hence came the &s;hameful plunder|ing of bi&s;hoprics, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities, which were &s;tripped of their be&s;t e&s;tates, under the colour of an unequal compen&s;ation in impropriations: and this niggardly temper was the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of Havre de Grace, and that her fleets on the mo&s;t im|portant occa&s;ions, as in the engagement with the in|vincible armada, and the expeditions to Spain and Portugal, were not &s;upplied with ammunition and provi&s;ions adequate to the enterprizes they were &s;ent upon. It was this avarice that &s;ubjected her to that cen&s;ure of Sir Walter Raleigh, "that &s;he did every thing by halves."</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">King James proclaimed.</NOTE> Upon Elizabeth's demi&s;e at Richmond, the council then attending at that place, proclaimed King James; after which they came about eleven o'clock to Whitehall; and, meeting there with &s;uch of the Prelates and Nobility as had come to town upon their &s;ummons, agreed upon the form of a proclamation to be made in London, and &s;ent over the kingdom. This proclamation was read at the gate of Whitehall, and at the cro&s;s of Cheap&s;ide, by Secretary Cecil, the heralds attending, and the peo|ple receiving it with a wonderful unanimity, and an univer&s;al applau&s;e. That day Sir Charles Piercy, bro|ther to the Earl of Northumberland, and Sir Thomas Somer&s;et, &s;on to the Earl of Worce&s;ter, were di&s;patch|ed with letters to inform his Maje&s;ty of what had been done, and of the joy with which he would be received in his new kingdom, and to a&s;&s;ure him of the readine&s;s of the nobility to obey all his commands. He received the welcome news on March 26, and &s;et out on Wed|ne&s;day, April 6, from Edinburgh, attended by &s;ome of the principal of the Scotch nobility: and, being magnificently entertained by &s;everal of the nobility and gentry on his journey, arrived at Theobald's (a hou&s;e belonging to Sir Robert Cecil) on May 3, where the Lords of the council attended him. The coronation was celebrated in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey, on Monday, July 25, being St. James's day; John Whitgift, Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, performing the ceremony of crowning and anointing both the King and Queen. The Romani&s;ts were not more di&s;appointed than the Puritans, in their expectations of a toleration from
<PB N="417" REF="452">this King. The&s;e la&s;t founded their hopes in the King's being bred up among the Scotch Pre&s;byterians; and they pre&s;ented him a petition, in October, in the name of a thou&s;and mini&s;ters, de&s;iring an alteration in &s;ome parts of the liturgy, a reformation in &s;ome points of di&s;cipline, and an exemption from &s;ub&s;cribing to the <HI>book of common prayer.</HI> The King and council, far from approving, rejected the petition with indignation: but as the deputies, that pre&s;ented it, pre&s;&s;ed much for leave to hold a di&s;putation on the &s;ubject, the King appointed a conference for that purpo&s;e in the January following, 1604. The conferences was held for three days (January 14, 16, and 18,) at Hampton court: but with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s on the Puritans &s;ide, that a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, on March 1, ordering the laws to be put in execution again&s;t all that did not con|form, and declaring again&s;t all future alterations and innovations. This proclamation was preceded by an|other, dated February 22, bani&s;hing all Je&s;uits, &s;emi|nary and other Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, requiring them to quit the realm before March 19, and never to return, un|der penalty of the laws being executed upon them with the utmo&s;t rigour.</P>
<P>The parliament met, on Monday, March 19, at We&s;t|min&s;ter: and the King opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a long &s;peech; in which he recommended the union of the two realms, who&s;e crowns were already united in his per&s;on; and, after exclaiming again&s;t the exorbitant power or claims of the Papacy, and expre&s;&s;ing his a|ver&s;ion to per&s;ecution, dclared the manner in which he intended to proceed both again&s;t the Roman Catholics and Puritans. Several bills were brought into the hou&s;e of Commons this &s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of the Puri|tans, but they all mi&s;carried. Richard Bancroft, Bi&s;hop of London, pre&s;ided in the convocation; the &s;ee of Canterbury, to which he was &s;oon after promo|ted, being vacant by the death of Whitgift, on February 29; and a body of 141 canons, collected for the mo&s;t

The principal point was the putting them in execution: this the King enjoined, and the council pre&s;&s;ed, re|quiring a &s;trict conformity to the rules of the church, according to the canons on that &s;ubject, and the act of uniformity. The&s;e orders, by Bancroft's care and ex|ample, were &s;o well ob&s;erved, that the mini&s;ters were obliged either to quit their churches or to conform: and by the puni&s;hment of a few of their leaders, &s;uch a general terror was &s;truck into the re&s;t, that noncon|formity grew out of fa&s;hion, in le&s;s time than can be ea&s;ily imagined.

This year is remarkable for that hor|rid and diabolical con&s;piracy of the Papi&s;ts, common|ly called the <HI>powder plot;</HI> which was di&s;covered by an anonymous letter to the Lord Monteagle, warning him from attending the parliament that was to meet on November 5. They had found means to convey into a vault under the parliament-hou&s;e, about thirty-&s;ix barrels of powder, with an intent of blowing up the hou&s;e, whil&s;t the King made his &s;peech at the opening of the parliament.

Of tho&s;e who were executed, Sir Everard Digby, Robert Winter, Thomas Bates, Thomas Winter, Ambro&s;e Rockwood, and Guido Faux, expre&s;&s;ed great penitence for the crime: but none more than Henry Garnet, provincial of the Engli&s;h Je&s;uits, who &s;uffered for concealing the con&s;piracy.

This parliament enacted many things for the di&s;covery and repre&s;&s;ing of Popi&s;h recu&s;ants: where|of none was more effectual than the <HI>oath of allegi|ance,</HI> which every per&s;on was commanded to take. Paul V. hereupon di&s;patched two <HI>briefs</HI> into England, prohibiting all Catholics to take this oath, &s;o de&s;truc|tive (as he alledged) to their own &s;ouls, and the &s;ee of Rome; exhorting them to &s;uffer per&s;ecution, and manfully to endure martyrdom: notwith&s;tanding which, the oath being tendered, was generally taken without any &s;cruple.</P>

At his appearing he que&s;tion|ed the authority of the court, and per&s;i&s;ting in his ob|&s;tinacy, was pronounced an incorrigible heretic, and delivered over to the &s;ecular magi&s;trate. He was burnt in Smithfield. In the next month, Edward Whitman, of Burton upon Trent, was burned at Litchfield, for maintaining heterodox opinions.</P>
<P>A. D. 1617.] The King, having lately made a pro|gre&s;s thro' Lanca&s;hire, ob&s;erved that the exce&s;&s;ive &s;cruples of &s;ome magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters, and their tying people up from all &s;ort of relaxation on Sunday, had given the Papi&s;ts occa&s;ion to mi&s;report the church of England, as if no innocent recreation was allowed among the reformed: to prevent their gaining pro|&s;elytes upon this pretence, his Maje&s;ty publi&s;hed a de|claration for allowing the people their u&s;ual recreations after divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>A. D. 1621.] This &s;ummer Archbi&s;hop Abbot, be|ing invited by the Lord Zouch to kill a buck at his park at Bramzil in Hamp&s;hire, met with a calamitous misfortune; for &s;hooting at a deer with a cro&s;s-bow, the keeper coming up unwarily too forward, was &s;truck with the arrow under the left arm, and died about an hour after. The King, apprehen&s;ive that &s;candal might be given, ordered the ca&s;e to be examined by commi&s;&s;ioners whom he appointed. However, the Archbi&s;hop was not deprived; he gave 20 <ABBR>l</ABBR> a year to the man's widow, and kept a monthly fa&s;t on Tue&s;day, being the day of the week whereon the misfortune happened.</P>
<P>A. D. 1624.] The act of the 27th of Henry VIII. obliging the grantees of religious hou&s;es to maintain tillage, and keep on ho&s;pitality, was repealed by the parliament. The cla&s;hing between the Engli&s;h regu|lars and &s;eculars has been already related. To keep up
<PB N="422" REF="459">this difference, to give orders, and to keep the party better united, the &s;eculars and Benedictines de&s;ired the Pope to put them under the government of a Bi&s;hop, Pope Urban VIII. con&s;ecrated Richard Smith, and &s;ent him to England for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A. D. 1625.] In the beginning of this year the King fell ill of an ague,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death and character of K.

Lord Bacon admires this King for the compa&s;s and extent of his genius, for the &s;trength of his memory, for the quickne&s;s of his apprehen&s;ion, for his penetration, and his ready meth$$ical way of &s;peaking. Dr. John Williams, Bi&s;hop Lincoln, Lord Keeper, in his &s;ermon at the King's funeral, drew a parallel between Solomon and the Prince decea&s;ed.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of the</HI> LIFE <HI>and</HI> REIGN <HI>of</HI> KING CHARLES I. <HI>and the</HI> STATE <HI>of</HI> RELIGION <HI>from</HI> 1625 <HI>to</HI> 1660, <HI>to the</HI> RESTORATION <HI>of</HI> CHARLES II.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the decea&s;e of James, his only &s;on Charles was, according to cu&s;tom, proclaimed at Theo|balds, in London, and el&s;ewhere. The parliament and convocation being &s;oon to meet, Bi&s;hop Laud was directed by his Maje&s;ty to con&s;ult the learned Bi&s;hop Andrews upon the juncture, and to take his advice what was fit to be debated on the &s;ubject of religion. The marriage agreed in the late reign, between his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty and the French King's &s;i&s;ter, was &s;o|lemnized
<PB N="423" REF="460">lemnized by proxy at Paris May 1; and on the 7th, the corp&s;e of the late King was interred at We&s;tmin|&s;ter in Henry VII.'s chapel, King Charles, in his own per&s;on, mournfully attending the funerals of his fa|ther. Soon after his Maje&s;ty met the Queen at Dover, and conveyed her to London, after the con&s;ummation of the marriage at Canterbury. On the 18th of June the parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter, but nothing ma|terial happened in it, except a remon&s;trance again&s;t the growth of Popery; to &s;atisfy which the King wrote in December to the two Archbi&s;hops to perform their part for di&s;covering and apprehending of Je&s;uits, and &s;eminary prie&s;ts, requiring them to proceed again&s;t Popi&s;h recu&s;ants by excommunication, and other cen|&s;ures of the church. The King, having &s;ummoned another parliament to meet on Feb. 6, 1626, re&s;olved to proceed to his coronation before the &s;e&s;&s;ion: the fea&s;t of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin was fixed on for this &s;o|lemnity. And for the better adju&s;ting every part of the ceremony to the &s;ervice and orders of the church of England, the King i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and &s;ome other Bi&s;hops, to &s;ettle the form; which being done, Williams the Dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter being out of favour, Dr. William Laud was appointed in his &s;tead to perform the Dean's part, in preparing for that pompous &s;olemnity. And finding the old cruci&s;ix among the <HI>regalia,</HI> he placed it on the altar according to the antient u&s;age. In the latter end of the late King's reign, Mr. Richard Mon|tague had begun a controver&s;y with the Roman Ca|tholics in favour of the church of England; and, for &s;ome things he had advanced to di&s;tingui&s;h her doc|trine from the Calvini&s;tical tenets, had been deeply cen&s;ured by tho&s;e of that party. They pretended he had de&s;erted the church of England, and made dan|gerous advances towards Popery and Arminiani&s;m. Montague, having procured a copy of an information they intended to lay before the next parliament, had
<PB N="424" REF="461">applied to the King for his protection. James, taking notice of the heat and clamour of Montague's adver|&s;aries, gave him leave to appeal to him, and make his de&s;ence in print. The tract was entitled <HI>Appello Cae&s;arem:</HI> but that King dying before it was printed off, it was addre&s;&s;ed to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Montague had been &s;ummoned before the late parliament, and a cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed on his writings; and now was &s;ummoned again, and his appeal to Cae&s;ar debated. This book being referred by the Commons to a committee, Mr. Pym made his report of &s;everal opinions extracted from it as erroneous; upon which the hou&s;e re&s;olved, "That Mr. Montague endeavoured to reconcile England to Rome, and alienate the King's affection from his well|affected &s;ubjects." This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of a com|mittee of religion in the hou&s;e of Commons. It does not appear that this impeachment was laid before the hou&s;e of Lords, nor in what manner the Commons intended to pro&s;ecute their charge, or how far they pro|ceeded. Neither does it appear that Montague was brought to his defence, or that he returned any an&s;wer to the articles of the charge: from whence it may be concluded, that the proce&s;s was dropped by the Com|mons. The Commons complaint of the growth of Popery, and the King's letters to the Bi&s;hops and Judges, to pro&s;ecute <HI>recu&s;ants,</HI> looked like a &s;torm coming from that quarter. The Pope, receiving ad|vice of this unexpected turn, &s;ent a con&s;olatory letter to the Engli&s;h Roman Catholics. This Pope, like Paul V. &s;eems to mi&s;take the purport of the oath of allegiance; he takes it for granted that this te&s;t means more than a &s;ecurity for loyalty and civil obedience. Notwith&s;tanding he recommends &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and pa&s;|&s;ive obedience, lets them know, that they are not to apply to any expedients of violence, and that prayers and patience are the only defence Chri&s;tian &s;ubjects are allowed to make u&s;e of.</P>
<PB N="425" REF="462">
<P>The deanery of the chapel royal being vacant by the death of Bi&s;hop Andrews, Laud was preferred to that &s;tation. He had ob&s;erved an over ceremonious cu&s;tom prevail through the late reign. When the King came into his clo&s;et to hear the &s;ermon at cha|pel, it was the cu&s;tom to break off divine &s;ervice, and &s;ing the an hem, that the preacher might go into the pulpit. This was exce&s;&s;ive re&s;pect, and looked as if the King came into the hou&s;e of God to be wor|&s;hipped. Laud therefore entreated his Maje&s;ty to be pre&s;ent at the Liturgy, as well as the $$rmon; and that, at whatever part of the prayers the King came in, the prie&s;t might proceed to the end of the &s;ervice. The King con&s;ented; &s;o far from bring di&s;concerted, that he thanked the Bi&s;hop for &s;o pious a &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>A. D. 1628.] On the 7th of March a new parlia|ment met at We&s;tmin&s;ter. This parliament, to &s;hew their concern for religion, brought in a bill "for re|formation of &s;undry abu&s;es committed on the Lord's day." There was a &s;tatute to this purpo&s;e made in the fir&s;t year of this reign; which was &s;ortified and extended by the pre&s;ent parliament. The Commons brought in a charge again&s;t Dr Manwaring for preach|ing arbitrary doctrine. He had lately, in two &s;ermons before the King at Whitehall, delivered him&s;elf very indi&s;creetly to this purpo&s;e. "That the King is not bound to pre&s;erve the &s;ubjects in their legal rights and liberties: that his royal will and ab&s;olute command, in impo&s;ing loans and taxes, though without the con|&s;ent of the parliament, ought to be obeyed by the &s;ubject under the penalty of eternal damnation: that tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to comply, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law of God, and incurred the guilt of impiety, di&s;loyalty and rebellion." The Commons, by their Speaker, de|manded judgment of the Lords again&s;t him; upon which they gave &s;entence, "that he &s;hould be im|pri&s;oned during plea&s;ure, fined in a thou&s;and pounds, &s;u&s;pended for three years from the exerci&s;e of the mi|ni&s;try,
<PB N="426" REF="463">make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and his &s;ermons &s;hould be burnt." About this time the Commons addre&s;&s;ed the King with a remon&s;trance, &s;hewing, "That they had rea&s;on to apprehend a &s;ecret de&s;ign of introducing a change in religion: that it was the vi&s;ible increa&s;e of Popery, and the particular countenance received at court, which occa&s;ioned that jealou&s;y; and that the minds of his &s;ubjects were further alarmed by his Ma|je&s;ty's letters for &s;topping legal proceedings again&s;t Papi&s;ts, &amp;c." This addre&s;s was not well received by his Maje&s;ty. However, the Commons went to draw an|other remon&s;trance again&s;t tonnage and poundage. Upon which the King prorogued them to the 20th of January; and thus the pre&s;enting it was prevented. His Maje&s;ty publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to the fir&s;t remon|&s;trance: it was drawn up by Laud; who, &s;oon after the rece&s;s of parliament, was tran&s;lated from Bath and Wells, to London: and Montague was pro|moted to the &s;ee of Chiche&s;ter. At the confirma|tion of Bi&s;hops, there is public notice given, that if any per&s;ons can object again&s;t the party elected, or the legality of the election, they are to come and offer their exceptions at the day prefixed. This inti|mation being given, one Jones, a book&s;eller, attended with a mob, appearing at the confirmation, excepted again&s;t Montague, as a per&s;on unqualified for the epi&s;copal dignity. But his exceptions being neither given in writing by an advocate, nor pre&s;ented by any proctor of the court (the&s;e being material circum&s;tan|ces) the confirmation went on: and, to &s;et Montague out of the reach of the&s;e cavils, he was con&s;ecrated two days after at Croydon.</P>
<P>After the murder of the Duke of Buckingham, who was &s;tabbed by one Felton at Port&s;mouth, Dr. Laud &s;eemed to fill his room in the King's e&s;teem, and had a con&s;iderable direction of affairs both in church and &s;tate. In order to &s;ilence the con|trover&s;y between the Calvini&s;ts and Arminians, he
<PB N="427" REF="464">procured the reprinting of the nine and thirty articles, with the King's declaration prefixed at the head of them. The Calvini&s;ts complained loudly of this de|claration, and drew up an addre&s;s, which they intended to pre&s;ent to the King, for recalling it: but this was &s;topped in its pa&s;&s;age, and never reached his Maje&s;ty. In the interval of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the King thought proper to &s;uppre&s;s Dr. Manwaring's &s;ermons, by proclama|tion: and Montague's appeal to Cae&s;ar, as being thought the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of the&s;e controver&s;ies, were called in; all per&s;ons, who had any of the&s;e books in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being ordered to deliver them to the Bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e. However, to &s;ecure Monta|gue from further trouble, and relieve Manwaring a little under the parliamentary &s;entence, they had both his Maje&s;ty's pardon; and Manwaring, notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;entence of the Lords had di&s;abled him from promotion, was pre&s;ented to a rector&s;hip, and after|wards made Bi&s;hop of St. David's. The preferring this gentleman, who had recanted in form, was far from being acceptable, It &s;eemed like partiality to the prerogative, and made the parliament more warm at their next meeting, and the King lo&s;e ground in the affection of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>A. D. 1629.] At the meeting of the parliament, the Commons concerned them&s;elves about controver|&s;ies of religion, pronounced upon the &s;en&s;e of the thirty-nine articles, and &s;eemed to cla&s;h with the King's declaration. Pur&s;uant to a &s;peech of Pym's, wherein he complains of innovations in religion, &amp;c. the com|mittee except to the pardons of Montague and Man|waring, complain of Richard Neal Bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter for procuring them, and pronounce an Armi|nian the &s;pawn of a Papi&s;t. And thus the humour beginning to run high in the lower hou&s;e again&s;t the court, the King di&s;&s;olved the parliament, on March the 10th. Laud, who had now the a&s;cendant at court, being &s;en&s;ible that the di&s;cipline and revenues of the
<PB N="428" REF="465">church were mi&s;managed, and out of order, was in|tent upon providing a remedy. To this purpo&s;e he con&s;ulted Samuel Har&s;enet Archbi&s;hop of York; and the&s;e two threw their &s;cheme into ten articles, and pre|&s;ented them to the King. This draught was &s;igned by his Maje&s;ty, and publi&s;hed under the title of his "In&s;tructions to the mo&s;t Reverend Father in God, George Lord Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury."</P>
<P>A. D. 1630.] In Lent, John Davenant Bi&s;hop of Sarum preaching before the King, happened to touch on the quinquarticular controver&s;y, which gave great offence to the King. The Bi&s;hop's text was out of Romans vi. 3. <HI>Eternal life is the gi&s;t of God, through je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> The third head of his &s;ermon was, that the godly are happy in the manner of their reward, becau&s;e the eternal life be&s;towed upon them is <HI>donum gratuitum,</HI> or free and unmerited bounty. From this propo&s;ition he con&s;idered eternal life under three re&s;pects; <HI>that is, in the eternal de&s;tination thereof, which we call free election.</HI> This being the pa&s;&s;age which gave offence, the Bi&s;hop's apology was, "that the doctrine of prede&s;tination was not forbidden by the King's de|claration, becau&s;e it e&s;tabli&s;hes all the nine and thirty articles, among&s;t which that of prede&s;tination is one." The Lords of the council told him, that it was his Ma|je&s;ty's plea&s;ure that the&s;e my&s;terious que&s;tions &s;hould not be debated. He replied, he was &s;orry he did not know his Maje&s;ty's mind, and that for the future he would govern him&s;elf accordingly. Upon this he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without farther trouble, and afterwards ad|mitted to ki&s;s the King's hand, who told him, the doctrine of prede&s;tination was too big for the people's under&s;tanding, and that the preaching reformation and good life would be much more &s;erviceable to the au|dience.</P>
<P>A. D. 1633.] Archbi&s;hop Abbot dying this year, Augu&s;t 4, Laud &s;ucceeded him in the &s;ee of Canter|bury. The fir&s;t directions he received from court re|ferred
<PB N="429" REF="466">to the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordinations. To &s;ecure the clergy from indigence and dependance, it was provided by the canons, that none &s;hould be ordained without a title. A title for maintenance is thus &s;ettled by the church; the per&s;on to be ordained mu&s;t either exhibit his pre&s;entation to &s;ome benefice within the dioce&s;e of the Bi&s;hop ordaining, or bring an unque&s;tionable cer|tificate of his being provided of a curacy in the &s;aid dioce&s;e, or that he is a&s;&s;ured of officiating as deacon or prie&s;t in &s;ome cathedral or collegiate church, or that he can make proof of his being a fellow or chaplain in &s;ome college in Oxford or Cambridge, or that he is five years &s;tanding ma&s;ter of arts, and lives in one of the univer&s;ities upon his own charges; or, la&s;tly, the Bi&s;hop who ordains him &s;hall engage to prefer him &s;hortly to &s;ome cure then void.</P>
<P>About this time the King publi&s;hed a declaration for allowing of lawful &s;ports on the Lord's day. This declaration, whether upon the &s;core of indulging too much liberty, or di&s;pen&s;ing with a late act of parlia|ment, was not well received, and gave the people a further di&s;gu&s;t to the admini&s;tration. Some of the clergy, who &s;crupled the reading of it in their church|es, were &s;u&s;pended by the ordinaries, and pro&s;ecuted in the high commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e rigours, though not very common, heightened the complaints, and di&s;&s;er|ved the government both in church and &s;tate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On June 18, his Maje&s;ty was crowned King of Scotland at Holyroodhou&s;e by John Spotti&s;wood, Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1634.] this year the clergy of London pe|titioned the King for the benefit of the law, and the due payment of their tithes; which pecition was gra|ciou&s;ly received, and &s;everal of the privy council were appointed to examine it: however, it came to nothing. This year al&s;o the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury began his metropolitical vi&s;itation in the dioce&s;e of Lincoln; and, in the fir&s;t place, John Williams, the Bi&s;hop,
<PB N="430" REF="467">and the &s;ix Archdeacons, were &s;u&s;pended the exerci&s;e of their juri&s;diction during the time of their vi&s;itation. The bringing the communion-table into the chancel, which &s;ituation had been long di&s;continued in &s;everal places, occa&s;ioned a warm conte&s;t both in this dioce&s;e and el&s;ewhere. The churchwardens were now ordered to remove the communion table to the ea&s;t end of the chancel, and inclo&s;e it with a decent rail; it having been inclo&s;ed in the middle by order of Williams, the then Bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e.</P>
<P>A. D. 1635.] In July, a proclamation was publi&s;h|ed again&s;t profane &s;wearing and cur&s;ing, pur&s;uant to an act in the late reign. An office was likewi&s;e erected for receiving the penalty of the &s;tatute, and the mo|ney ari&s;ing from thence was to be paid to the re&s;pec|tive Bi&s;hops, and di&s;tributed among the poor where the offender dwelt.</P>
<P>A. D. 1636.] At this time a controver&s;y happened between the Archbi&s;hop and the two univer&s;ities, con|cerning the right of vi&s;itation. The Archbi&s;hop claimed a right of vi&s;iting upon the privilege of his &s;ee. The univer&s;ities, on the other &s;ide, alledged, that this juri&s;diction was ve&s;ted in the King, upon the &s;core of being their founder. The cau&s;e was brought before the council-board, his Maje&s;ty being pre&s;ent, to hear and determine the debate, which was decided in favour of the Archbi&s;hop. This year Pryn, Ba&s;twick, and Burton, were tried in the high-commi&s;&s;ion court for libelling the hierarchy, and were &s;entenced next year in the &s;tar-chamber to pay a fine of five thou&s;and pounds each, and to &s;uffer perpetual impri&s;onment, after ha|ving their ears cut off in the pillory. Pryn had lo&s;t part of his four years before, for a like offence: how|ever, he had no abatement in his puni&s;hment for that misfortune, but was &s;entenced to lo&s;e the remainder, and be marked on both cheeks with the letters <HI>S</HI> and <HI>L,</HI> &s;ignifying a &s;editious libeller.</P>
<PB N="431" REF="468">
<P>The Roman Catholics were not all this time negli|gent of their intere&s;t. About two years before this, Panzani, the Pope's agent, came to London; part of his bu&s;ine&s;s being to di&s;cover, whether the King would permit tho&s;e of his communion a Catholic Bi&s;hop of the Engli&s;h nation: and, to make the motion pa&s;s the better, they were contented this Bi&s;hop &s;hould be no|minated by his Maje&s;ty, and not exerci&s;e his function but under &s;uch limitations as the King &s;hould pre|&s;cribe. Upon this reque&s;t, a query was put to Pan|zani, "Whether the Pope would allow the nomina|ting &s;uch a Bi&s;hop as held the oath of allegiance a law|ful engagement? and whether his Holine&s;s would give the Engli&s;h of his communion leave to take the oath?" Panzani, finding him&s;elf &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed in the que&s;tion, declared he had no commi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak to that matter. Upon this di&s;appointment, he went low|er in his reque&s;t, and, by &s;ome corre&s;pondence at court, moved the King, that the Queen might be permitted an agent from the Pope, for directing her &s;piritual af|fairs. The King, by the advice of his council, con|de&s;cended to the motion, upon condition that the par|ty &s;ent &s;hould be no prie&s;t. Panzani, having conti|nued in England two years, returned to Rome, leaving Seignior Con, a Scotchman, in his &s;tead; who, being a per&s;on of dexterity and addre&s;s, worked him&s;elf into a conver&s;ation with &s;ome of the mini&s;try, and endea|voured to get acquainted with Laud. But the Arch|bi&s;hop having no good opinion of him, or his bu&s;ine&s;s, would not &s;o much as admit of a vi&s;it of ceremony. However, by the King's connivance, and the Queen's favour, the Papi&s;ts came &s;omewhat forward, appeared in greater numbers at court, and frequented their de|votions at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, with more freedom than formerly. This being ob&s;erved, the blame was chiefly laid upon Laud; and &s;everal libels were &s;cattered in London, reflecting on him, as an encourager of the ma&s;s, and little better than the Pope's pen&s;ioner. Wal|ter
<PB N="432" REF="469">Montague, a younger &s;on of the Earl of Manche|&s;ter, and Sir Toby Matthews, &s;on of the late Arch|bi&s;hop of York, had been very active in their mi&s;&s;ion, and, among&s;t others, had lately converted the Coun|te&s;s of Newport. The Archbi&s;hop finding him&s;elf at|tacked with calumny, took this opportunity to di&s;|prove the imputations. Being at the council-table, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the King, and in a full di&s;cour&s;e acquainted his Maje&s;ty with the growth of the Roman Catholic intere&s;t; that the Papi&s;ts met frequently at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e; and that Montague and Matthews had taken un&s;ufferable liberties, practi&s;ed upon his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and particularly upon tho&s;e within the verge of the court. This &s;peech being well re|ceived by the King, Montague and Matthews were ordered to retire.</P>
<P>A. D. 1639.] In the dioce&s;e of Exeter, one Cox preached a &s;ermon upon Ho&s;ea iv. 4. to prove that the church of England did not maintain the calling of Bi&s;hops to be <HI>jure divino;</HI> which made an ill impre&s;&s;ion upon a great many people in tho&s;e parts. But the Bi&s;hop of Exeter having di&s;cour&s;ed this Cox, &s;ent him up to the Archbi&s;hop; where receiving full &s;atisfac|tion upon the que&s;tion, he went home and, of his own voluntary motion, made a hand&s;ome recantation, and recovered the people he had formerly mi&s;led.</P>
<P>A. D. 1640.] The late troubles in Scotland, and the King's indulgence to the covenanters, animated the faction in England; the times grew di&s;turbed, and the faction was greatly embarra&s;&s;ed. To relieve the King under the&s;e difficulties, the Earl of Stafford, the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the Marquis of Ha|milton, advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to call a parliament; it was likewi&s;e re&s;olved at the board, to give an extraor|dinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in ca&s;e the hou&s;e &s;hould prove in|compliant, and refu&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;ub&s;idies. The parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on April 13: &s;oon after the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion the King &s;ent a me&s;&s;age
<PB N="433" REF="470">to the lower hou&s;e, to put them in mind of &s;up|plies; reporting the intolerable u&s;age he had received from the Scots; and declaring, that provided they granted him an aid &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, he would give up his claim of <HI>&s;hip-money,</HI> and &s;atisfy all other rea&s;onable demands. But the commons, as things were managed, were in no di&s;po&s;ition for compliance; they in&s;i&s;ted upon farther &s;ecurities for property, for better &s;ettlement of religion, and for privilege of par|liament. The que&s;tion was, whether the King's me&s;|&s;age, or the Commons reque&s;t, was fir&s;t to be con&s;i|dered? After &s;everal conferences between the two hou&s;es, the Lords voted a preference to the King's bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Commons to that of the &s;ubject. But the di&s;pute was quickly ended, no le&s;s unfortunately than it began: for Secretary Vane, being ordered to acquaint the Commons in what proportion the King de|&s;ired to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, propo&s;ed twelve &s;ub&s;idies; whereas, it was &s;aid, he had expre&s;s orders to mention no more than &s;ix. This being looked on as an exce&s;&s;ive demand, &s;hocked the Commons, and put them quite out of tem|per: &s;o that proceeding to &s;ome unacceptable debates, the King, de&s;pairing of any good i&s;&s;ue, di&s;&s;olved the parliament. However, the convocation &s;till continu|ed &s;itting, having received a commi&s;&s;ion from under the broad &s;eal, for altering the canons, or making new ones. Archbi&s;hop Laud brought in one "for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the farther growth of Popery." A canon was drawn "for the better keeping the day of his Maje&s;ty's inauguration:" and another was levelled again&s;t the &s;preading of the Socinian here&s;y. The next provi&s;ion was a re&s;traint of <HI>&s;ectaries:</HI> by which canon it was de|creed, that all tho&s;e proceedings and penalties mention|ed in the canon again&s;t Popi&s;h recu&s;ants, &s;hould, as far as they are applicable, &s;tand in full force and vigour, again&s;t all Anabapti&s;ts, Browni&s;ts, Separati&s;ts, Fami|li&s;ts, or other &s;ects what&s;oever, who refu&s;e repairing to
<PB N="434" REF="471">their pari&s;h-churches for hearing divine &s;ervice, and re|ceiving the holy communion.</P>
<P>Thus far the convocation had gone when the par|liament was unfortunately di&s;&s;olved: notwith&s;tanding of which they went on with their bu&s;ine&s;s, though the pro&s;pect was dark, and the juncture very di&s;couraging: for five hundred of the mob had lately made a march to Lambeth, and attacked the Archbi&s;hop's palace two hours: but being di&s;appointed in their malice, and forced to retire, they re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault the con|vocation. The King being informed of the danger, appointed them a guard, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome companies of the train bands of Middle&s;ex, commanded by En|dymion Porter, a well-affected gentleman. The canons afterwards pa&s;&s;ed in this convocation are as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. An oath enjoined for the preventing of all innova|tions in doctrine and government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A declaration concerning &s;ome rites and ceremonites.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Of preach|ing for conformity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. One book of articles of en|quiry to be u&s;ed at all parochial vi&s;itations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Concerning the conver&s;ation of the clergy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Chan|cellors patents.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Chancellors alone not to cen&s;ure any of the clergy in &s;undry ca&s;es.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Excommuni|cation, and ab&s;olution, not to be pronounced but by a prie&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Concerning the commutations, and the di&s;po&s;ing of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Concerning &s;ome concurrent juri&s;dictions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. Concerning licences to marry: and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. Again&s;t vexatious citations.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The&s;e canons were all unanimou&s;ly &s;ub&s;cribed by the convocation, Godfrey Goodman, Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, excepted. Before their &s;ub&s;cription they were read before the King and Privy-Council; the Judges, and other eminent per&s;ons of the long robe, being pre&s;ent. They were approved by the whole audience, the King giving the Archbi&s;hop thanks for bringing things to &s;o good an i&s;&s;ue. After this &s;olemn approbation they were &s;ub|&s;cribed in the upper hou&s;e by the Bi&s;hops, and the re&s;t of the clergy, none refu&s;ing to put their hand but
<PB N="435" REF="472">the Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter. This Prelate's firmne&s;s to the reformation had been formerly que&s;tioned, which &s;u&s;picion was increa&s;ed by this refu&s;al; for it was thought the &s;trictne&s;s of the canon for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the growth of Popery, was the only rea&s;on of his &s;tanding off. He was fir&s;t argued with, and then required to acquie&s;ce, by his Metropolitan: but the&s;e methods proving ineffectual, he was &s;u&s;pended <HI>ab officio et be|neficio</HI> by both hou&s;es. The &s;entence being put into form, &s;igned by the Archbi&s;hop, and publickly pro|nounced, his Maje&s;ty ordered his commitment. But this durance was but &s;hort; for on the 10th of July he acknowledged his mi&s;behaviour before the Lords of the council, and took the oath enjoined by the &s;ixth canon, upon which he recovered his liberty. The&s;e canons were greatly complained of: but it appears, that the guarding the government, the pinning the &s;ub|jects &s;o clo&s;e to their duty, and declaring &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t rebellion, was the great grievance in them.</P>
<P>The King having lately marched again&s;t the Scots, a paper was dropped in Covent Garden, to encourage the apprentices and &s;oldiers to attack the Archbi&s;hop: but, one of the mob having been executed for the late attempt on Lambeth, they had not courage enough to renew the enterprize. But not long after, when the high commi&s;&s;ion &s;at at St. Paul's, about two thou&s;and Browni&s;ts in&s;ulted the court, pulled down all the benches in the con&s;i&s;tory, and cried out they would have no Bi&s;hops nor High Commi&s;&s;ion. The King, by this tumult, was put to the expence of a guard for St. Paul's, as he had been for We&s;tmin&s;ter before.</P>
<P>On the 3d of November, the long parlia|ment,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Long par|liament meets.</NOTE> which proved &s;o fatal to the King, met at We&s;tmin&s;ter. At the opening this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Commons made &s;peeches again&s;t the crown, and the church, in a very remarkable man|ner; and gave early indications of what followed. The Earl of Strafford, who commanded the Engli&s;h
<PB N="436" REF="473">army, came up to London, at the King's in&s;tance, and ventured him&s;elf with the parliament. This, both by him&s;elf, and his friends, was thought a &s;tep &s;omewhat too hardy. But the caution was over-ruled by his Maje&s;ty, who promi&s;ed his protection, and re|fu&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e with his ab&s;ence at the <HI>council-board.</HI> However, this nobleman's apprehen&s;ions of danger were too well founded; for, upon his appearing in the hou&s;e, he was impeached for high trea&s;on by the Com|mons, committed to the black rod, and &s;ent to the Tower &s;oon after. The government being now in a vi&s;ible declen&s;ion, Burton and Prynne got loo&s;e from their confinement, and made a pompous entry into London; being attended from Brentford with &s;everal thou&s;ands of hor&s;e and foot, with ro&s;emary in their hats. Thus the King's courts of ju&s;tice, which had cen&s;ured the&s;e men, were openly in&s;ulted: and the criminals were admitted to the hou&s;e of Commons, to prefer petitions again&s;t the pro&s;ecutors. By this coun|tenance the Puritan faction was further animated to at|tack the church, Alderman Pennington, with a re|tinue of &s;ome hundreds, came to the hou&s;e of Com|mons, and pre&s;ented a petition &s;ub&s;cribed by fifteen thou&s;and Londoners, tho' not in the name of the cor|poration. This paper exhibited a &s;trong complaint again&s;t the ceremonies and di&s;cipline of the church of England: but, containing too much matter for &s;udden di&s;patch, it was po&s;tponed to a time of more lei&s;ure, Upon December 15, the Commons attacked the late convocation in form, and re&s;olved, <HI>nullo contradicente,</HI> "1. That the clergy of England, convened in any convocation, or &s;ynod, or otherwi&s;e, have no power to make any con&s;titutions, or acts, whatever, in mat|ters of doctrine, di&s;cipline, or otherwi&s;e, to bind the clergy or laity of the land, without common con&s;ent of parliament. 2. That the &s;everal con&s;titutions and canons eccle&s;ia&s;tical, treated upon by the Archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, Pre&s;idents of the convoca|tion
<PB N="437" REF="474">for the re&s;pective provinces of Canterbury and York, and the re&s;t of the Bi&s;hops and clergy of tho&s;e provinces, and agreed upon with the King's Maje&s;ty's licence, in their &s;everal &s;ynods begun at London and York in 1640, do not bind the clergy or laity of this land, or either of them." The next day, the &s;ame &s;ubject being re&s;umed, it was re&s;olved, <HI>nullo contradicente,</HI> "1. That the&s;e canons, above-mentioned, do con|tain in them many matters contrary to the King's pre|rogative, to the fundamental laws and &s;tatutes of this realm, to the rights of parliament, to the property and liberty of the &s;ubject; and matters tending to &s;edition, and of dangerous con&s;equence. 2. That the &s;everal grants of the benevolences, or contributions granted to his mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty, by the clergy of the pro|vinces of Canterbury and York, in the &s;everal convo|cations or &s;ynods holden at Canterbury and York, A. D. 1640, are contrary to the laws, and ought not to bind the clergy." The next day Mr. Denzil Hol|lis was &s;ent up from the lower hou&s;e to the Lords, with an impeachment of high trea&s;on again&s;t Archbi&s;hop Laud: upon which he was committed to the black rod, and continued under that re&s;traint till the 1&s;t of March next year, when he was &s;ent to the Tower. The di&s;|cipline of the church &s;inking with the Archbi&s;hop, about four&s;core Anabapti&s;ts, meeting at a hou&s;e in St. Saviour's, Southwark, preached that the 35th of Eli|zabeth, enjoining the u&s;e of the <HI>common prayer,</HI> was no legal &s;tatute, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hops concurred to the making of it. From hence they advanced to the crown, a&s;&s;erting, that the King cannot make a good law, becau&s;e not <HI>perfectly regenerate;</HI> and that he is only to be obeyed in matters relating to the &s;tate. Up|on their being brought before the Lords, they con|fe&s;&s;ed the articles, but were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>A. D. 1641.] On March 10, a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of Commons, and pa&s;&s;ed, "That no
<PB N="438" REF="475">Bi&s;hop &s;hould have any vote in parliament, any judi|cial power in the &s;tar-chamber, or any authority in temporal affairs; and that no clergy man &s;hould be in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace. This bill had many abettors in the hou&s;e of Lords, where it was afterwards thrown out. The Earl of Strafford was now brought to his trial. Several articles were brought again&s;t him; but that which lay harde&s;t upon him was, his advi&s;ing the King, as it was pretended, to bring over the Iri&s;h army to reduce this kingdom to obedience. The&s;e words were &s;aid to be &s;poken at the council-board, when the di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t parliament was re&s;olved on. The charge was &s;upported only by a &s;ingle evidence, and contradicted by the re&s;t of the cabinet; and Secre|tary Vane, this evidence, had twice depo&s;ed before that he knew nothing of the matter. The Lord Digby, tho' one of the committee for preparing matter for, and managing the trial of the Earl, was &s;o affected with the di&s;proof of this grand article, that he &s;olemnly wa&s;h|ed his hands of Strafford's blood, and refu&s;ed to concur with the bill. The Commons di&s;tru&s;ting the force of their evidence, and being apprehen&s;ive the Earl would be acquitted by his Peers, changed their battery, and proceeded by way of attainder. The Bi&s;hops moved to be excu&s;ed from being pre&s;ent on the trial. The bill pa&s;&s;ed with the Commons, but found more oppo|&s;ition from the upper hou&s;e: till the mob, counte|nanced by the Earl of Strafford's enemies, came down to the parliament-hou&s;e in formidable numbers, and in&s;ulted the Lords, by crying <HI>Ju&s;tice, ju&s;tice;</HI> and either frightened them from the hou&s;e, or overawed the ma|jority into a compliance. Notwith&s;tanding the opi|nions of the Judges, Bi&s;hops, &amp;c. that it was nece&s;|&s;ary to appea&s;e the people, and for the pre&s;ervation of him&s;elf and family, that the King &s;hould give his a&s;|&s;ent to the bill, nothing could prevail on his Maje&s;ty to con&s;ent to it. To &s;et his con&s;cience at liberty, the Earl very generou&s;ly wrote him a letter to per&s;uade his
<PB N="439" REF="476">compliance; and declared him&s;elf willing to re&s;ign his life, rather than keep up a mi&s;under&s;tanding between the King and his &s;ubjects. The King at la&s;t gave a commi&s;&s;ion to the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Cham|berlain, and &s;everal others, to pa&s;s the attainder: and, at the &s;ame time, he &s;igned another de&s;tructive act, for continuing the &s;e&s;&s;ion as long as the parliament &s;hould think fit. Thus the parliament had &s;ome colour, tho' no law, for pu&s;hing things to an extremity, and levy|ing men and money again&s;t the government. Had not this act been pa&s;&s;ed, the King might have &s;cattered them at di&s;cretion; and in ca&s;e they had been &s;o hardy as to have &s;at after a di&s;&s;olution, they would have wanted a varni&s;h to cover their coar&s;e complexion, and the revolt would have been more legible and unconte&s;t|ed: The Earl of Strafford was executed &s;oon after, and &s;uffered with great calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation, profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf innocent in the intents and purpo&s;es of his heart of what he died for, and praying God would for|give tho&s;e who contrived his death.</P>
<P>A de&s;ign was now forming in the parliament for lopping the revenues of the church, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the deaneries and chapters. The clergy, endeavouring to break this propo&s;al, ordered one in each cathedral to come up, and &s;olicit their friends in either hou&s;e: they drew a petition to the Lords and Commons, but it was never pre&s;ented: they likewi&s;e retained coun&s;el, and in&s;tructed them with heads to plead on. But be|ing informed, that the hou&s;e would not allow them the benefit of the long robe; and that, if they had any thing to &s;ugge&s;t, they mu&s;t appear and plead their own cau&s;e, they made choice of Dr. John Hacket, Pre|bendary of St. Paul's, and Archdeacon of Bedford, for their council. This Gentleman, being admitted to the bar of the hou&s;e of Commons, made a very ju|dicious &s;peech, which &s;o affected the hou&s;e, that had the alienation of the lands been then put to the que&s;tion, it is thought it would have gone in the negative, by a
<PB N="440" REF="477">great majority. A bill brought up from the Commons to the Lords, again&s;t Bi&s;hops and clergymen, con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;everal branches, was voted by parts. The branches were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That they &s;hould have no votes in parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they &s;hould not be in the com|mi&s;&s;ion of the peace, nor Judges in temporal courts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That they &s;hould neither &s;it in the Star-chamber, or be privy coun&s;ellors.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The univer&s;ities perceiving the cathedrals in danger, and the encouragement of learn|ing &s;truck at, addre&s;&s;ed the parliament upon the &s;ub|ject. A bill for taking away the <HI>high commi&s;&s;ion</HI> was &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of Lords, on June 24, pa&s;&s;ed there, and was &s;oon after &s;igned by the King: and the court of &s;tar-chamber was al&s;o put down &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops intere&s;t failing in the upper hou&s;e, the Commons re&s;olved to pu&s;h the opportunity: and they were not only &s;truck at in the parliamentary privilege, but in their &s;piritual character. They pre&s;ented a re|mon&s;trance to his Maje&s;ty on that &s;ubject, but did not receive an an&s;wer to their liking. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;appointment, they re&s;olved to follow their blow. The bill for taking away the Bi&s;hops votes was brought in for another trial, and the hou&s;e carried it for excluding the Bi&s;hops. To decline the odium of innovating thus openly upon the con&s;titu|tion, and di&s;charging one branch of the three e&s;tates from any &s;hare in the legi&s;lature, &s;ome endeavours had lately been u&s;ed to per&s;uade the Bi&s;hops to gratify the importunity of the Commons, and to give up their right of &s;itting in parliament. But they had too much direction and courage to betray their intere&s;t, and throw up their peerage. This bu&s;ine&s;s, though now in agitation, was not fini&s;hed till two months after|wards. In the mean time, to &s;ucceed again&s;t this re|pul&s;e, and batter the re&s;olution of the Lords Spiritual, the apprentices were drawn down to We&s;tmin&s;ter, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the faction, and overawe the prelatic party.
<PB N="441" REF="478">The&s;e auxiliaries came to the parliament-doors in great bodies, and cried, <HI>No Bi&s;hops.</HI> From hence they ad|vanced to downright railing and in&s;ulting their per&s;ons, throwing &s;tones at them; &s;o that they could not come to the hou&s;e, either by land or water, without appa|rent hazard of their lives. The rabble, thus encou|raged, made an a&s;&s;ault upon We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey; and &s;ome of them owned their de&s;ign was to pull down the organs, and deface the monuments. John Williams, then Archbi&s;hop of York, to prevent this horrible ravage, and &s;ecure the <HI>regalia</HI> from being &s;eized, made fa&s;t the doors, and maintained the abbey again&s;t them. The two hou&s;es taking no notice of this tumult, the rioters continuing in the &s;ame phrenzy and outrage, and the Bi&s;hops going to the parliament-hou&s;e being altogether impracticable, they met at the Dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter's lodgings, and &s;ub&s;cribed a prote&s;tation for pre&s;erving their right of &s;itting in parliament. It was drawn up by Archbi&s;hop Williams in the form of a petition, and was to be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty in the hou&s;e of Peers. Five of the &s;ees being vacant, and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops gone down into the country, it was only &s;igned by twelve, viz. The Archbi&s;hop of York, the Bi&s;hops of Durham, Litchfield, Norwich, St. A&s;aph, Bath and Wells, Hereford, Oxford, Ely, Glouce&s;ter, Peterborough, and Landaff. This pro|te&s;tation was put into the Lord Keeper Littleton's hand, but not to be read, till the King, at the Bi&s;hops in&s;tance, came into the hou&s;e of Peers. But he, con|trary to direction, communicated the affair to &s;ome unfriendly members of both hou&s;es before the time. Immediately, upon reading the paper in the upper hou&s;e, the anti-epicopal Lords de&s;ired a conference with the Commons. The petition being put into their hands, the Lord Keeper declared the prote&s;tation con|tained "matters of high and dangerous con&s;equence, and intrenched upon the fundamental privileges and being of the parliament." The Commons re&s;olved to
<PB N="442" REF="479">&s;eize the opportunity, and within half an hour after they had the in&s;trument, they &s;ent up to the Lords, and, without farther debate, impeached the twelve Bi&s;hops, who &s;igned the prote&s;tation, of high trea&s;on. This charge being carried to the upper hou&s;e by Mr. Glyn, the black rod was immediately ordered to go in &s;earch of the Bi&s;hops, and bring them forthwith before the Lords. They appeared at the bar that evening, and were committed to the Tower: all except the Bi&s;hops of Durham, Coventry, and Litchfield, who, in regard of their age, and ill health, had the favour of being re|mitted to the cu&s;tody of the Gentleman U&s;her. About a fortnight after, they were &s;everally brought to the bar of the hou&s;e of Lords, and put in their an&s;wers to the impeachment in the following form. "I&mdash;Bi&s;hop of&mdash;&s;aving to my&s;elf all advantages of exception to the in&s;ufficiency of the &s;aid impeachment, for my&s;elf, &s;ay, that I am not guilty of the trea&s;on charged by the &s;aid impeachment, in manner and form as the &s;ame is therein charged." After this an&s;wer, the Bi&s;hops peti|tioned the hou&s;e of Lords, for trial or bail; and the Lords a&s;&s;igned them the twenty-fifth of January for their trial, remanding them in the mean time to their for|mer confinement, where they continued till the be|ginning of the next year; at which time the Lords ad|mitted them to bail. They lived where they plea&s;ed, without ever being called to a trial; which is a clear proof they had done nothing unwarrantable by law; for had they been any way obnoxious, their enemies would not have failed in their pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>A. D. 1642.] The ma&s;k was now laid a&s;ide, the anti-epi&s;copalians appeared more in their colours. Pe|titions from different counties were delivered to the hou&s;e of Commons, praying that the Popi&s;h Lords and Bi&s;hops votes may be taken away. The bill before-mentioned, again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, pa&s;&s;ed the $$n&s;e in the beginning of February: and, the &s;ame d$$, they &s;ent to the King, then at Wind&s;or, to pre&s;s for his con&s;ent. This me&s;&s;age was &s;econded by tho&s;e
<PB N="443" REF="480">of greate&s;t tru&s;t about the King, and he was at la&s;t prevailed with to pa&s;s the bill.</P>
<P>At length the tumults increa&s;ed &s;o much, that his Maje&s;ty thought proper to retire into York&s;hire, and prepare for his own defence. During his &s;tay, the remarkable <HI>nineteen propo&s;itions</HI> were &s;ent by the two hou&s;es. The eighth of the&s;e propo&s;itions, relating to the church, de&s;ired, "That his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to con&s;ent to &s;uch a reformation, of the church|government and liturgy, as both hou&s;es of parliament &s;hould advi&s;e; and that for this purpo&s;e they intended to con&s;ult with divines, as was expre&s;&s;ed in their decla|ration. On the other hand, numbers of petitions were &s;ent both to the King and parliament in favour of epi&s;copacy. And now, the two hou&s;es having &s;eized the magazines, and places of &s;trength, the war began, and the rebellion flamed out. After &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes, the parliament forces fought the King's at Edgehill with &s;ome di&s;advantage. Immediately after this battle, the King reduced Banbury ca&s;tle, marched towards London as far as Brentford, and, after &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es, countermarched to Oxford, for winter|quarters.</P>
<P>A. D. 1643.] Before the next campaign was opened, the King received, from the parliament, &s;ome propo&s;i|tions towards an accommodation: but they came to no|thing. Though the two hou&s;es had no conce&s;&s;ion from the King to warrant their proceedings, they pa&s;&s;ed an or|dinance to &s;eque&s;ter the Bi&s;hops, and other delinquents e&s;tates. By delinquents was meant, tho&s;e who declared for the King, and refu&s;ed to join in the rebellion. The rents and profits of the &s;ees and capitular bodies, which lay within the reach of the parliament army, were &s;eized, and the re&s;t of the loyal clergy were &s;eque&s;tered under the character of &s;candalous mini&s;ters. And now mo&s;t of the &s;ilenced lecturers, and other preachers, who, with in the la&s;t ten years, had left the kingdom for noncor formity, debt, &amp;c. returned about this juncture. The
<PB N="444" REF="481">men were preferred to the &s;eque&s;tered benefices; but, to keep them &s;ervile and true to the cau&s;e, they were but like tenants at will, and held their living only <HI>du|rante bene placito.</HI> The King, acquainted with the oppre&s;&s;ion, and illegal proceedings, publi&s;hed a pro|clamation again&s;t them: but, though this &s;hewed his Maje&s;ty's care to protect the loyal clergy, it had no effect to &s;top the per&s;ecution. Be&s;ides their attacking the hierarchy in their reputation, the parliament played a more effectual battery again&s;t the church, and exe|cuted their de&s;ign already mentioned of <HI>con&s;ulting</HI> godly, religious, and learned divines. For this pur|po&s;e they did not think fit to wait his Maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure, but, upon the return of their commi&s;&s;ioners from Oxford, convened an a&s;&s;embly by their own authority.</P>
<P>The &s;ummoning of this a&s;&s;embly, by the parlia|ment, was a new provocation to his Maje&s;ty, and an unprecedented incroachment upon the royal prero|gative. And, be&s;ides the illegality of the meeting, it was mo&s;tly made up of per&s;ons di&s;affected to the church: and, which was a farther rea&s;on for ju&s;t ex|ception, the divines were intermixed with &s;ecular men; and, in ca&s;e of any difference, the two hou&s;es were the la&s;t judges of the controver&s;y. Upon the&s;e con&s;ide|rations, the King publi&s;hed his proclamation, before the &s;itting of this extraordinary &s;ynod, "prohibiting all per&s;ons, mentioned in that pretended ordinance, the a&s;|&s;embling for that purpo&s;e, declares the a&s;&s;embly illegal; that no acts done by them ought to be received by the &s;ubject; and that the allowing the a&s;&s;embly men wages, by a tax upon the public, was an unheard-of pre&s;umption." Notwith&s;tanding this proclamation, &s;ixty-nine, of the hundred and twenty nominated, met at the time and place appointed. On the fir&s;t of July, pur&s;uant to the ordinance, the&s;e divines met in king Henry VII.'s chapel. The a&s;&s;embly was opened with a &s;ermon, preached by their prolocutor Dr. Twi&s;&s;e, both hou&s;es of parliament being pre&s;ent. One of their fir&s;t acts,
<PB N="445" REF="482">was a petition to the parliament, for a &s;olemn fa&s;t, on account of the late defeats of their forces in the North and in the We&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Waller had been beaten in the We&s;t, by the King and Lord Fairfax, in the North by the Earl of Newca&s;tle.</NOTE>. This petition was well approved, and a public fa&s;t was ordered upon Friday following.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other calumnies now thrown upon the King, the rebels mi&s;repre&s;ented his religion, and re|ported him inclined to Popery; which they knew would prove a &s;ignificant a&s;per&s;ion, and di&s;incline the people to his &s;ervice. His Maje&s;ty therefore, to un|deceive his &s;ubjects in that particular, made a &s;olemn declaration of his belief; for being ready to receive the holy euchari&s;t, from the hands of the Lord Pri|mate U&s;her, he ro&s;e from his knees, and, giving the Archbi&s;hop a &s;ign for a &s;hort pau&s;e, &s;poke thus: "My Lord, I e&s;py here many re&s;olved Prote&s;tants, who may declare to the world the re&s;olution I do now make. I have, to the utmo&s;t of my power, prepared my &s;oul to become a worthy receiver: and may I &s;o receive comfort by the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acraments, as I do in|tend the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the true, reformed, Pro|te&s;tant religion, as it &s;tood in its beauty in the happy days of Queen Elizabeth, without any connivance at Popery. I ble&s;s God, that, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e public di&s;tractions, I have &s;till liberty to communicate; and may this &s;acrament be my damnation, if my heart doth not join with my lips in this prote&s;tation." That this purgation was &s;ea&s;onable, may be collected from a pamphlet publi&s;hed &s;ometime before by one Salt|mar&s;h, where, among&s;t other directions, he advi&s;es "to cheri&s;h the war under the notion of combating Popery;" for this was the &s;ure&s;t means to engage the people. Two more of his &s;ugge&s;tions were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. That all means &s;hould be u&s;ed to keep the King and his people from a &s;udden union;" and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>"2. If the King would not grant their demands, then to root him out, and the royal line, and transfer the crown
<PB N="446" REF="483">upon &s;omebody el&s;e."</ITEM>
</LIST>
This de&s;perate advice was read in the hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the King's arms &s;truck &s;uch a terror, that the leading members were preparing to retire beyond &s;ea: and had the Earl of Newca&s;tle, in&s;tead of &s;itting down before Hull, marched into the a&s;&s;ociated counties, and had the King at the &s;ame time omitted the &s;iege of Glouce&s;ter, and made for London, the war, in all likelihood, had been at an end. But the parliament, gaining time by the mi&s;|conduct of the royali&s;ts, applied to the Scotch for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, engaging with them in their covenant, and &s;upplying them with a hundred thou&s;and pounds, prevailed on them to enter England with a great army.</P>
<P>A. D. 1644.] This &s;ummer, after the battle at Mar&s;ton Moor, in which the King's forces were de|feated, the a&s;&s;embly of divines communicated a letter to the parliament, which they received from the Kirk of Scotland. It was a &s;ort of remon&s;trance again&s;t the dilatory proceedings in &s;ettling the church-govern|ment in England. This expo&s;tulation was not without effect; for &s;oon after the a&s;&s;embly had leave to draw up a form for <HI>ordination</HI> of mini&s;ters, and debating the &s;ettlement of the church. In October, an ordinance was pa&s;&s;ed, touching <HI>ordination.</HI> By this provi&s;ion, &s;ome a&s;&s;embly-men of di&s;tinction, and certain London mini&s;ters, were empowered to <HI>lay their hands</HI> upon &s;uch per&s;ons as they found qualified for the holy mini&s;try. Archbi&s;hop Laud, having been three years impri&s;oned, was brought to his trial this year, on March 12; which was not ended till the month of October: when the hou&s;es thought fit to proceed by way of attainder. The bill pa&s;&s;ed with the Commons, November 16, but it was much longer before the Lords concurred to it: but they were obliged at la&s;t by menaces to agree to it. The Archbi&s;hop was beheaded, on January 10, 1645, on Tower-hill: and &s;uffered with great forti|tude, calmne&s;s, and re&s;ignation.</P>
<PB N="447" REF="484">
<P>An ordinance had pa&s;&s;ed, the day of the Arch|bi&s;hop's attainder, for laying a&s;ide the <HI>common prayer,</HI> and u&s;ing the <HI>directory</HI> in&s;tead of it. This <HI>directory,</HI> drawn by the a&s;&s;embly of divines, was tran&s;mitted in parts to the parliament; where, after a debate in both hou&s;es, it was confirmed, with &s;ome &s;mall alterations. In the latter end of January, commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent from the King, and parliament, to Uxbridge, to en|deavour an accommodation: but, after &s;everal days debate, the treaty broke up. The parliament, en|couraged by their late victory at Na&s;eby, repeated their ordinance for putting the directory in execution, with penalties upon tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to comply, or made u&s;e of the common prayer. The King, in No|vember, publi&s;hed a counter-proclamation to this ordinance, in which he &s;trictly injoined the u&s;e of the common prayer, and charged the directory with open|ing a liberty to ignorance and faction.</P>
<P>There had been for &s;ome time two different parties in the parliament, the Pre&s;byterians and Independants. The&s;e latter had moved for a toleration, and, being now grown &s;tronger, a committee was appointed for an accommodation. The two hou&s;es having &s;pent &s;everal months in drawing propo&s;als to be &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty touching a peace, the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners excepted again&s;t part of the draught; e&s;pecially the &s;ubjecting church-a&s;&s;emblies to the controulment and deci&s;ion of the parliament, and depriving them of great part of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction. Notwith|&s;tanding this remon&s;trance, the two hou&s;es were un|willing to come under any re&s;traints, or part with their &s;piritual empire.</P>
<P>A. D. 1646.] The parliament &s;eems to have been afraid of the Scotch di&s;cipline, and of being fettered too much in their intere&s;t, their pride, or their plea|&s;ures. However, the King, now incapable to keep the field, retiring to the Scotch army, and ca&s;ting him&s;elf upon the duty and honour of that party, the
<PB N="448" REF="485">two hou&s;es thought it nece&s;&s;ary to come towards a compliance. The Scotch, having the advantage of the King's per&s;on in their army, were not to be too much provoked. They therefore pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance for the "pre&s;ent &s;ettling of the Pre&s;byterian govern|ment," without delay. The King, being now at Newca&s;tle with the Scotch army, had a conference with Mr. Alexander Hender&s;on, one of the Scotch divines, about church-matters. The Engli&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners, being informed how well his Maje&s;ty had performed again&s;t Mr. Hender&s;on, declined engaging in any di&s;pute, and only de&s;ired his an&s;wer to their propo&s;itions; but the&s;e were &s;o unrea&s;onable that the King could give them no &s;atisfaction. In October following the parliament made an ordinance, for abo|li&s;hing the name, dignity, and function, of all Arch|bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, alienated their lands, and &s;ettled them in tru&s;tees; and, not long after, ordered them to be &s;old for the payment of debts, and di&s;charging the public faith. It is probable the new preachers ex|pected to have rai&s;ed their fortunes upon the ruins of epi&s;copacy, and had their livings augmented with Deans and Chapters lands. But now they found them&s;elves di&s;appointed, the alienations transferred to &s;ecular u&s;es, and the plunder lodged in other men's coffers. Be|&s;ides, the parliament had agreed to pay the Scotch 400,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> of arrears, for the delivering up his Ma|je&s;ty, and wanted to rai&s;e the money.</P>
<P>A. D. 1647.] The Pre&s;byterian party had now di&s;|abled the King in the field, got him in their cu&s;tody at Holmby, routed the regular clergy, and procured a &s;ettlement of di&s;cipline from the two hou&s;es. When they had &s;urmounted &s;o many difficulties, and thought their pro&s;perity e&s;tabli&s;hed, they met with an unlooked|for misfortune. For the parliament having brought the war to an end, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Scotch, re&s;olved to di&s;band a great part of the army. But the&s;e mea|&s;ures were by no means acceptable to the general
<PB N="449" REF="486">officers. They were altogether unwilling to quit their command, and lo&s;e the advantage of &s;o much hazard and fatigue. Therefore they declared again&s;t di&s;banding, and marched their forces towards Lon|don, contrary to the orders of parliament. After this they proceeded more directly towards a rupture, and impeached eleven members of the hou&s;e of Com|mons of high trea&s;on: and, being &s;en&s;ible how &s;er|viceable the King's per&s;on would be to them, they &s;ent Cornet Joyce, with a party of hor&s;e, to bring his Maje&s;ty to their head-quarters at Wooburn in Bed|ford&s;hire. Joyce executed his commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;uc|ceeded in the attempt, without meeting any re&s;i&s;tance. And thus they who had embroiled the kingdom, kindled and carried on a calamitous war, after having thrown their country into this mi&s;ery and convul&s;ion, met with nothing but di&s;appointment; for now the Independants made them&s;elves ma&s;ters both of church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>The parliament being informed of the army's nearer advance towards London, both the Speaker and &s;everal members fled, and, on Augu&s;t 7, the General and the army marched in triumph through the city. His Ma|je&s;ty being ordered to Hampton-court, and his children allowed to be with him, the Commons, on September 28, con&s;idered of &s;everal propo&s;itions to be &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty. On November 11, the King made an e&s;cape from Hampton-court: but, on October 15, informa|tion was brought to the hou&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty was &s;afe at the I&s;le of Wight, and had put him&s;elf under the protection of Colonel Hammond, then governor of the i&s;land. The Pre&s;byterian party of the two hou&s;es, who were willing to pre&s;erve the King, prevailed &s;o far as to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners down, and propo&s;e an accom|modation. When the treaty broke up, the commi&s;|&s;ioners made their report at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and his Maje&s;ty's conce&s;&s;ions, though very great, were voted un&s;atisfactory. However, being afraid of the army,
<PB N="450" REF="487">they re&s;umed the debate, and, after a long &s;truggle, re&s;olved, that the King's compliance was a ground to proceed on for the &s;ettlement of the nation. But they were now in no condition to go on with an accommo|dation: for the army now made loud remon&s;trances again&s;t it, and having &s;eized and impri&s;oned &s;everal members of the lower hou&s;e, overawed the re&s;t of the Pre&s;byterian party. In 1648, the Independants being the majority, the Commons retract their former vote, and come to a contrary re&s;olution. In &s;hort, the King is removed from Cari&s;brook to Hur&s;t Ca&s;tle; from thence conveyed by the army to Wind&s;or, and from thence to London. And now they laid the ma&s;k a&s;ide, and di&s;covered their intentions. The King was treated without ceremony, the marks of &s;overeign re&s;pect forbidden, and a committee appointed by the Com|mons to draw up a charge of high trea&s;on again&s;t him. This in&s;olent impeachment was unanimou&s;ly rejected by the Peers, who then adjourned. Upon this the Commons declared them&s;elves the &s;upreme power, &s;hut up the hou&s;e of Lords, and went on without them. In 1649, a high court was erected in We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall for the trial of the King. When his Maje&s;ty was brought before them, he denied the au|thority of the court, argued again&s;t their impudence, and behaved like a great Prince. Upon his refu&s;ing to plead, they condemned him to be beheaded. This unparalleled outrage of Maje&s;ty, and the con&s;titution, &s;truck the Pre&s;byterian party with horror. The&s;e men, though they had been zealous in the revolt, and preached up the war again&s;t the King, had no inten|tion of going this hideous length. Therefore, when they found the King's trial re&s;olved by the rump, they made a &s;trong remon&s;trance again&s;t it.</P>
<P>On the 28th of January at night, Juxon Bi&s;hop of London was admitted to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty in his de|votions: and on Tue&s;day following, January 30, the execrable murder was committed on the &s;ide of
<PB N="451" REF="488">the &s;ide of the Banquetting hou&s;e at Whitehall. The King appeared on the &s;caffold undi&s;turbed in a&s;pect and motion, &s;upported his character to the la&s;t minute, and declared him&s;elf of the communion of the church of England, as it was left him by his father James. Thus died Charles I. a Prince of great abilities, equal and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate in his temper, and remarkably regular in his private life. He never entered on his diver&s;ions abroad, till he had fir&s;t paid his duty to God at the public prayers. He was likewi&s;e very &s;trict in ob&s;erv|ing the hours for his cabinet-devotion; and would not allow any licentious je&s;ts, any rallying of religion, though ever &s;o much recommended by plea&s;antry and wit. He was well furni&s;hed with capacity and re&s;olu|tion to advi&s;e at the council-board, and execute in the field. Two of his greate&s;t misfortunes &s;eem to have been a blind uxoriou&s;ne&s;s and an exce&s;s of clemency: he had likewi&s;e too mode&s;t a &s;en&s;e of his own judg|ment and &s;ufficiency: which diffidence made him &s;ometimes over-ruled by other mens opinions wor&s;e grounded than his own. The extent of his knowledge, the force of his rea&s;oning, and the noblene&s;s of his manner, is &s;ufficiently di&s;covered in his printed works. The beautiful turn and lu&s;tre of his compo&s;itions are &s;eldom met with in Engli&s;h authors of that age. The Lord Chancellor Clarendon, who knew him very well, gives him the character of the worthie&s;t gentleman, the be&s;t ma&s;ter, the be&s;t friend, the be&s;t hu&s;band, the be&s;t father, and the be&s;t chri&s;tian, that the age in which he lived produced. He left i&s;&s;ue three &s;ons, Charles Prince of Wales, James Duke of York, and Henry Duke of Glouce&s;ter, who died &s;oon after the re&s;toration. His daughters were, the Prince&s;s Mary, married to the Prince of Orange; Elizabeth, who died during the u&s;urpation at Cari&s;brook ca&s;tle; and Hen|rietra, married to the Duke of Orleans.</P>
<P>The Prince of Wales was at the Hague when his father was murdered; and the parliament forbade the
<PB N="452" REF="489">proclaiming him under the penalty of high trea&s;on. They vote the hou&s;e of Lords u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous, giving the Peers liberty to &s;it in the hou&s;e of Com|mons, provided they were elected. The rump parlia|ment, now at the helm, proceed to aboli&s;h kingly authority, and chu&s;e a council of &s;tate, with whom they lodge the executive part of the government. They then repeal the oaths of allegiance and &s;upre|macy. Thus when the rebels had made them&s;elves liable to the highe&s;t forfeitures, by a continued breach upon the&s;e laws, they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take them out of the way.</P>
<P>On April 10, an act was pa&s;&s;ed by the Commons, for the &s;ale of Deans and Chapters lands, and for the aboli&s;hing of Deans and Chapters, Canons, Prebends, &amp;c. and tithes of or belonging to any cathedral, or collegiate church in England and Wales: but it was provided, that this &s;hould not extend to the college of St. Mary's in Winche&s;ter, nor to that of Eaton. About this time, &s;ome fanaticks in the army called Levellers, being encouraged by the extravagant in|dulging of opinions, and flouri&s;hing upon the liberty of the &s;ubject, made an addre&s;s to the rump for ge|neral freedom. They de&s;ired "they might be re&s;tored to the privileges of Adam's de&s;cendants; that &s;ome of the re&s;traints of property might be taken off, and the earth made common to indu&s;try, that every body's labour might furni&s;h them freely with the conveniences of cloaths and diet; that the incumbrances of paying rent and doing homage to a fellow creature of their own might be no longer &s;uffered; and that the ma&s;k of &s;ervitude and tyranny being thus taken out of the way, all people might live at ea&s;e, and enjoy the benefit of their creation" everal acts pa&s;&s;ed in the pretended parliament, this &s;ummer, to keep on the ma&s;k of re|formation, again&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s, bla&s;phemies, and exe|crable opinions: and an act pa&s;&s;ed for the better main|tenance of preaching mini&s;ters and &s;choolma&s;ters (out
<PB N="453" REF="490">of the lands of Deans and Chapters) throughout Eng|land and Wales, in &s;uch places where maintenance is wanting.</P>
<P>Cromwell &s;till more di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the army; and was, this &s;ummer, &s;ent over commander in chief of the parliament forces for Ireland (then almo&s;t reduced to the King's obedience by the Marquis of Or|mond) with title of Lord Governor of that kingdom. His Maje&s;ty being at Jer&s;ey, part of the Engli&s;h fleet was &s;ent in July to attack that i&s;land: upon which the King removed into France; where he re&s;ided till the time appointed for a treaty with the Scots at Breda, when he repaired thither.</P>
<P>A. D. 1650.] This &s;ummer the King landed in Scot|land, and was proclaimed immediately at Edinburgh cro&s;s: but the kirk, not finding the King compliant with all their extravagant demands, &s;et up for them|&s;elves. In &s;hort, his Maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold is purged, and mo&s;t of the Royali&s;ts obliged to leave the country. The commonwealth of England now made Cromwell commander in chief of their forces, their General Fair|fax having re&s;igned, and ordered him to march into Scotland, to check the commotions there; which he performed with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, owing to their own divi|&s;ions, that, by the latter end of the year, he was ma&s;ter of all the &s;outh part of the country. In the mean time the King was crowned at Scoon in Scotland, with the u&s;ual ceremony and magnificence.</P>
<P>A. D. 1651.] The Scotch Royali&s;ts and Covenan|ters being now tolerably reconciled, his Maje&s;ty ap|peared at the head of a con&s;iderable army in that coun|try; and, after having tried his fortune to &s;ome di&s;|advantage with Cromwell, entered England by way of Carli&s;le, held on his march to Worce&s;ter, and entered that town. Cromwell and Lambert coming up, with a much &s;uperior army, a deci&s;ive battle was fought, on September 3; where his Maje&s;ty's troops, being over|powered
<PB N="454" REF="491">with numbers, were after a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance de|feated: after which the King lay concealed for &s;ome time, and with much difficulty got him&s;elf tran&s;ported over to France.</P>
<P>A. D. 1653.] Cromwell, now &s;trengthened in his intere&s;t, and elated with a cour&s;e of victory, grew weary of the rump parliament. The&s;e men lying in the way of his ambitious de&s;igns, he re&s;olved to make a bold pu&s;h: and, having concerted the de&s;ign with his officers, he marched to the parliament-hou&s;e with &s;ome troops, placed a guard at the door, and entered with a file of mu&s;queteers. His manner of addre&s;s was &s;uit|able to his military appearance; for, with an air of haughtine&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, he commanded the Speaker to leave the chair, told the hou&s;e "they had &s;ate long enough unle&s;s they had done more good," bid one of his &s;oldiers "take away that fool's bauble, the mace," &s;taid till the hou&s;e was empty, and then ordered the doors to be locked. The a&s;&s;embly of divines, who had grown le&s;s and le&s;s for &s;ome time, and dwindled to a committee, were now entirely di&s;abled and &s;unk with this long parliament. The fir&s;t u&s;urpation being thus melted down, Cromwell ca&s;t it in a new mould of his own contriving. After &s;ome days of humiliation, and &s;olemn pretences of &s;eeking God, he i&s;&s;ued out circular letters to a &s;elect number of his own creatures, to take upon them the government of the common|wealth. This was called <HI>Barebone's parliament.</HI> The&s;e members, for a proof of their zeal and capacity, vote down tythes, di&s;courage the mini&s;try, harra&s;s the uni|ver&s;ities, and run to the la&s;t extremes of folly and ex|travagance. This cau&s;ing great murmurs without doors, the enthu&s;ia&s;ts were apprehen&s;ive they might be called to an account, quitted their po&s;ts, and re&s;igned the go|vernment to Cromwell, who accepted it, under the title of Lord Protector.</P>
<P>A. D. 1654.] Being now &s;eated in his Protector's chair, Cromwell &s;ummoned a pretended parliament.
<PB N="455" REF="492">The&s;e members pa&s;&s;ed an act for &s;ettling a committee of <HI>Triers,</HI> for the approbation of public preachers. Tho&s;e who were admitted to any benefice or lecture, were obliged to pa&s;s the te&s;t of this committee. Their next &s;tatute provides for removing &s;candalous and in|&s;ufficient mini&s;ters and &s;choolma&s;ters; that is, tho&s;e who had continued firm to the church and crown. However, the&s;e u&s;urpers did not plunder and per&s;e|cute without &s;ome re&s;emblance of compa&s;&s;i$n: for, by the act, a fifth part of the benefice is allowed to the wives and children of the ejected mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>A. D. 1655.] In the beginning of this year, the pretended parliament, gra&s;ping at the &s;ole admini&s;tra|tion, and endeavouring to recover their former &s;way, was di&s;&s;olved by Cromwell.</P>
<P>A. D. 1656.] This year James Naylor, and &s;ome others impri&s;oned at Bri&s;tol, being charged with bla&s;|phemy, the hou&s;e ordered a committee to &s;end for them, and examine the witne&s;&s;es. Naylor was ac|cordingly brought to the bar of the hou&s;e: and, upon hearing the cau&s;e, they re&s;olved him a grand impo&s;tor, and guilty of horrid bla&s;phemy. They &s;entenced him to &s;tand two hours in the pillory at We&s;tmin&s;ter, to be whipt from thence to the Old Exchange by the com|mon executioner, and there to have his puni&s;hment in the pillory repeated; his tongue bored thro' with a hot iron, and his forehead branded with the letter B, with &s;ome other circum&s;tances of correction.</P>
<P>A. D. 1658.] Cromwell was taken &s;ick, in Augu&s;t, at Hampton Court: after a week's time, his di&s;ea&s;e began to &s;hew very de&s;perate &s;ymptoms; and, having declared his &s;on Richard his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, he died on Friday, Sep|tember 3, at three o'clock in the afternoon. After Cromwell's death, the u&s;urpation appeared more float|ing, frequently &s;hifted po&s;ture, and rolled thro' &s;eve|ral forms till the re&s;toration. Richard, having &s;at at the helm about half a-year, was laid a&s;ide, and the rump parliament revived in 1659. But they were
<PB N="456" REF="493">quickly di&s;placed by Lambert, Fleetwood, and &s;ome other officers of rank: who put down the rump's council of &s;tate, and &s;ettled a commi&s;&s;ion of &s;afety: but the admini&s;tration re&s;ted not long in their hands. Upon petitions from &s;everal parts of the kingdom for a free parliament, the rump recovered: and, in the be|ginning of the next year, General Monk, who had been treating with &s;ome agents from his Maje&s;ty, marched out of Scotland with his army, and came to London, in 1660, admitted the &s;ecluded members, and &s;oon after di&s;&s;olved the long parliament. A council of &s;tate was formed, and the Lords and Com|mons a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter. The&s;e Lords and Gentlemen recollecting the mi&s;erable un&s;ettled &s;tate of the kingdom, and the generality of people being tired with the anarchy and confu&s;ion, which the late di&s;&s;en|tions had occa&s;ioned, the juncture &s;eemed favourable for the re&s;toration of the kingly power. On April 27, Sir John Grenville pre&s;ented the General with a com|mi&s;&s;ion from his Maje&s;ty, con&s;tituting him Captain General of all the armies of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and a letter for the council of &s;tate, with a declaration of his Maje&s;ty's touching a free liberty of con&s;cience in matters of religion. Monk, coming to the parliament or convention, produced the letter and declaration, which, being read, gave great &s;atisfac|tion; and the hou&s;es voted, that, according to the antient and fundamental laws of this kingdom, the government is, and ought to be, by King, Lords and Commons. Hereupon &s;everal members of both hou&s;es are di&s;patched to his Maje&s;ty, with an invitation to come over, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government. His Maje&s;ty was at the Hague when the&s;e me&s;&s;engers waited on him; and after having been &s;ome days &s;plen|didly treated by the &s;tates, he embarked on board the Engli&s;h fleet, arrived at Dover, and was received by the kingdom with all imaginable marks of duty and inclination.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the <HI>STATE</HI> of <HI>RELIGION</HI> in <HI>ENGLAND</HI> from the Re|&s;toration in <HI>1660,</HI> to the Revolution in <HI>1689.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CHARLES was in the thirtieth year of his age when he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. He had taken pains in cultivating his under&s;tanding; and was well acquainted with the hi&s;tory and politics of the mo&s;t remarkable &s;tates in Europe. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a natural fund of humour and vivacity, together with the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s and power of plea&s;ing in conver&s;a|tion. The fir&s;t public act he pa&s;&s;ed was an act of in|demnity, tho&s;e only excepted who had been immedi|ately concerned in the late murder. Having adjourned the parliament, his Maje&s;ty publi&s;hed a proclamation on the &s;ubject of religion, directing the Bi&s;hops how to exerci&s;e their &s;piritual juri&s;diction; ordaining that a certain number of theologi&s;ts &s;hould be cho&s;en to re|view and alter the liturgy; and that no per&s;on &s;hould, in the mean time, be obliged to conform. Nine of the old Bi&s;hops, &s;till living, were re&s;tored to their dio|ce&s;es. Bi&s;hoprics and benefices were offered to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters; but they were refu&s;ed by all except Edward Reynolds, who be|came Bi&s;hop of Norwich.</P>
<P>A. D. 1661.] In the beginning of January one Ven|ner, a de&s;perate enthu&s;ia&s;t, and fifth-monarchy-man, appeared in the &s;treets of London at the head of three|&s;core fanatics compleatly armed, and proclaimed King Je&s;us. They &s;lew a man becau&s;e he declared him&s;elf for God and King Charles. They believed them&s;elves in|vulnerable,
<PB N="458" REF="495">made a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the train-bands &s;ent to quell them, and retreated to Kane|wood near Hamp&s;tead. Being di&s;lodged from thence in the morning, they returned to London, and took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hou&s;e, in which they defended them&s;elves until the greate&s;t part of them were killed. The &s;urvi|vors were taken, tried, condemned, and executed; and affirmed to the la&s;t, that if they had been deceived, the Lord him&s;elf was their deceiver. Some Pre&s;byte|rian mini&s;ters, finding them&s;elves confounded with o|ther &s;ectaries whom they abhorred, intreated the King to give order for a conference between them and the Bi&s;hops, that both &s;ides might candidly examine their objections to the Engli&s;h liturgy. Charles complied with their reque&s;t: one and twenty eccle&s;ia&s;tics were nominated on each &s;ide, and the conferences were be|gun in the hou&s;e of the Bi&s;hop of London, who lived in the Savoy. The Bi&s;hops would not offer &s;uch an indignity to the church as to make the lea&s;t conce&s;&s;ion to this &s;tubborn &s;ect; and the Pre&s;byterians exclaimed again&s;t the liturgy, and the &s;urplice, as relicks of the church of Rome. After an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute and virulent altercation, they parted, more than ever irritated a|gain&s;t each other.</P>
<P>A. D. 1662.] The King, &s;ending for the Commons to Whitehall,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act of U|niformity.</NOTE> expre&s;&s;ed uncommon zeal for the church of England, gave them to un|der&s;tand, that he had &s;ent the book of Com|mon Prayer to the Lords, with his approbation of &s;ome changes which the convocation had thought pro|per to make in it, that it might be more &s;uitable to an act of uniformity, which he de&s;ired the lower hou&s;e might prepare without pa&s;&s;ion or precipitation. The Commons were re&s;olved to manife&s;t their obedience. On the nineteenth of May, the King gave his a&s;&s;ent to the act for e&s;tabli&s;hing uniformity in public wor&s;hip, and in the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments. By this &s;tatute, which began to be in force on St. Bartholo|mew's
<PB N="459" REF="496">day, every mini&s;ter was obliged to conform to the wor&s;hip of the Engli&s;h church, according to the book of Common Prayer lately revived, and to &s;ign a declaration, approving of that ritual; to take the oath of canonical obedience, abjure the <HI>&s;olemn league and covenant,</HI> and acknowledge his dete&s;tation of the prin|ciples of taking up arms again&s;t the King, or tho&s;e acting by his commi&s;&s;ion, on any pretence what&s;oever. He was likewi&s;e re&s;trained from admini&s;tering the &s;a|craments, unle&s;s he had been previou&s;ly ordained by a Bi&s;hop. When the act of Uniformity took place, two thou&s;and Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters cho&s;e rather to re&s;ign their benefices than &s;ub&s;cribe the articles. In order to mitigate in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;everity of this act, the King i&s;&s;ued a declaration, promi&s;ing to u&s;e his influ|ence with the parliament, to concur in pa&s;&s;ing a law by which he might be enabled more fully to exert his di&s;|pen&s;ing power in favour of tho&s;e who, from con&s;ci|entious motives, could not comply with the act of U|niformity. This was intended as a preliminary to a general toleration, the benefit of which might extend to the Catholics, to whom the King had a &s;ecret pro|pen&s;ity. The Pre&s;byterians, thinking them&s;elves un|ju&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ed, petitioned the King and council, that they might be exempted from the penalties &s;pecified in the act of Uniformity; and his Maje&s;ty publi&s;hed a proclamation, declaring, that, though he adhered with all his heart to that act, neverthele&s;s, out of regard to &s;ome of his &s;ubjects, he was willing to di&s;pen&s;e with their ob&s;erving certain articles therein contained.</P>
<P>A. D. 1663.] The Commons, alarmed at the de|claration for indulgence, in which the King a&s;&s;umed a di&s;pen&s;ing power, and that too in order to weaken the force of the law which they had enacted, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s again&s;t it. They enumerated the inconve|niences which might ari&s;e from a toleration; and propo&s;ed, as the mo&s;t effectual method to prevent &s;chi&s;ms, troubles, and divi&s;ions, that the laws &s;hould
<PB N="460" REF="497">be executed for the &s;upport of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, according to the act of uniformity. Charles, finding his de&s;igns &s;o di&s;agreeable to the Commons, thought proper to po&s;tpone it to a more favourable opportu|nity.</P>
<P>A. D. 1665.] This year the parliament pa&s;&s;ed the famous <HI>five mile act,</HI> by which every non-conforming preacher was bani&s;hed five miles from the place where he had been mini&s;ter, after the act of indemnity, un|le&s;s he would take the oath of non-re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>A. D. 1666.] This period is remarkable for the dreadful fire of London, imputed, and upon the &s;tronge&s;t grounds, to the malice of the Roman Catholics.</P>
<P>A. D. 1669.] Whether Charles was willing to re|concile him&s;elf to the Pre&s;byterians, who con&s;tituted a powerful body in the nation, or the Duke of Buck|ingham, who had now great influence in the council, re&s;olved to forward a &s;tep which he knew would be di&s;agreeable to the Duke of Ormond, whom he hated, uncommon favour was now &s;hewn to that &s;ect, which had been &s;o much depre&s;&s;ed &s;ince the re&s;toration. They appeared more openly, and even ventured to a&s;&s;emble at their religious wor&s;hip. Sir Orlando Bridgeman &s;ent for two of their mini&s;ters, and con&s;ulted them about means for comprehending the Pre&s;byterians in the body of the Engli&s;h church, as well as for pro|curing an indulgence for Independents and other Non|conformi&s;ts. The&s;e two mini&s;ters, having conferred with a like number of the Engli&s;h church, after &s;everal meetings, and various di&s;putes, agreed, that, with re&s;pect to ordination, all Non-conformi&s;ts already or|dained might be admitted into the mini&s;try of the church, by virtue of this form, "Take thou legal authority to preach the word of God, and admini&s;ter the holy &s;acraments in any congregation in England, where thou &s;hall be lawfully appointed thereto." They likewi&s;e agreed, that ceremonies &s;hould be left indiffe|rent: that the liturgy &s;hould be altered: that tho&s;e
<PB N="461" REF="498">who could not be comprehended &s;hould be indulged: and that, for the &s;ecurity of the government, the names of the teachers, and all the members of the congregations, &s;hould be regi&s;tered. The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hales undertook to draw up a bill for this purpo&s;e, and the keeper of the great &s;eal promi&s;ed to &s;upport it in parliament with his whole intere&s;t. Gilbert Sheldon Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, being appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, wrote a circular letter to all his &s;uffragans, enjoining them to make an exact in|quiry touching all the conventicles that were held within their re&s;pective dioce&s;es. Having received all the information he could procure on the &s;ubject, he exaggerated every circum&s;tance to the King; and ob|tained, from his ea&s;y di&s;po&s;ition, a proclamation, or|dering the laws again&s;t non-conforming mini&s;ters to be put in execution. Neverthele&s;s, Charles gave the leading Pre&s;byterians to under&s;tand, that he had de&s;igns in their favour; and de&s;ired they would pre&s;ent a peti|tion to him for indulgence. The hou&s;e of Commons thanked the King, in an addre&s;s, for the proclamation he had publi&s;hed again&s;t conventicles, and appointed a committee to make exact inquiry concerning the con|duct of the Non-conformi&s;ts. The&s;e having received a great number of informations, reported, that divers conventicles and &s;editious a&s;&s;emblies were held in the neighbourhood of the parliament, &s;o as to in&s;ult the government, and endanger the public tranquillity: upon which the hou&s;e declared, that they would adhere to his Maje&s;ty for the &s;upport of the government in church and &s;tate again&s;t all &s;orts of adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>A. D. 1670.] The Lords and Commons jointly pe|tioned his Maje&s;ty, that he would give effectual orders for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing conventicles, and executing the laws again&s;t Popi&s;h recu&s;ants. Charles, though in his own nature aver&s;e to per&s;ecution, was too irre&s;olute to with&s;tand the zeal of his parliament; and therefore gave his a&s;&s;ent to an act, which declared an a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventeen per&s;ons, a conventicle, provided
<PB N="462" REF="499">they met to wor&s;hip God in any other form than that which was practi&s;ed in the church of England; even though ten of that number &s;hould belong to the fa|mily in who&s;e hou&s;e they might be a&s;&s;embled. Every individual was fined in five &s;hillings for the fir&s;t offence, and ten for the &s;econd. The preacher was condemned in twenty pounds for the fir&s;t conviction, and in double that &s;um for the next; and a fine of twenty pounds were decreed again&s;t the per&s;on in who&s;e hou&s;e they &s;hould be found a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>A. D. 1672.] A war breaking out this year with the Dutch, the King thought it nece&s;&s;ary to quiet the minds of his people, and &s;et them at ea&s;e in matters of religion. To that end, and probably with a view to favour the Roman Catholics, his Maje&s;ty publi&s;hed a declaration in March, &s;u&s;pending the penal laws again&s;t Non-conformi&s;ts, indulging the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters with the public exerci&s;e of their religion, and allowing the Catholics to wor&s;hip God after their own way in private.</P>
<P>A. D. 1673.] The court were mi&s;taken in thinking by this declaration for liberty of con&s;cience to &s;ecure the Pre&s;byterian intere&s;t; for that party &s;u&s;pected that the drift was, under &s;helter of them, to favour the Roman Catholics. Alderman Love, one of the chiefs of the Pre&s;byterian party, &s;pake in the hou&s;e with great &s;pirit again&s;t the declaration; and his di&s;inte|re&s;ted behaviour upon this occa&s;ion made &s;uch impre&s;|&s;ion on the Commons, that they brought in a bill for the relief of Prote&s;tant Non-conformi&s;ts: it pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e without oppo&s;ition; but the Lords pro|po&s;ed &s;ome amendments, with which the Commons would not comply; and, before the affair could be compromi&s;ed, the King prorogued the parliament. In the mean time the Lords and Commons addre&s;&s;ed the King again&s;t the Roman Catholics, de&s;iring that the laws might be vigorou&s;ly executed again&s;t Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits: that all officers, and per&s;ons in public employ|ments
<PB N="463" REF="500">in the army, &s;hould take the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, and receive the communion accord|ing to the form of the church of England. His Ma|je&s;ty publi&s;hed a proclamation to that effect, and was at la&s;t prevailed on, in order to appea&s;e them, to &s;end for the declaration, and break the &s;eal affixed to it, with his own hand. Soon after the parliament pa&s;&s;ed the famous <HI>te&s;t act,</HI> importing that every per&s;on in office or employment, &s;hould take the oaths of alle|giance and &s;upremacy; receive the &s;acraments in &s;ome pari&s;h-church before competent witne&s;&s;es, and &s;ub&s;cribe a declaration, renouncing all belief of the real pre|&s;ence in the enchari&s;t.</P>
<P>A. D. 1675.] The late mea&s;ures of the court had rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition in the Commons, that many members of the upper hou&s;e, and e&s;pecially the Bi&s;hops, began to dread the revival of the republican &s;pirit. In order to prevent the mi&s;chiefs which might ari&s;e from &s;uch a flame, Robert Bertie, Earl of Lind|&s;ey, brought into the hou&s;e of Lords a te&s;t bill, for impo&s;ing upon all per&s;ons, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, or military, employments, as well as upon privy coun|&s;ellors and members of parliament, an oath renouncing the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;ting the King, or tho&s;e acting under his commi&s;&s;ion, on any pretence what&s;oever; but a di&s;pute ari&s;ing between the Lords and Commons, on account of an appeal brought before the Lords by Dr. Shirley again&s;t Sir John Tagg, a member of the hou&s;e of Commons, the bill was dropped.</P>
<P>A. D. 1677.] A bill pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, and re|ceived the royal a&s;&s;ent, for taking away the writ <HI>de Heretico Comburendo.</HI> This year is remarkable for Oates's narrative of a plot, &s;aid to be carried on by the Je&s;uits, and other Roman Catholics, again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty's life, the Prote&s;tant religion, and the govern|ment of the kingdom. As the evidences were all men of profligate character, the truth of who&s;e depo&s;itions in &s;everal re&s;pects were flatly di&s;proved by numbers of
<PB N="464" REF="501">creditable witne&s;&s;es, it appears to have been only a villainous impo&s;ture, rai&s;ed by a &s;et of abandoned mi&s;|creants, for the mo&s;t infamous purpo&s;es: however, &s;uch was the prejudice of the people, that it rai&s;ed an univer&s;al ferment, and operated in defiance of com|mon &s;en&s;e and demon&s;tration. Numbers of per&s;ons were executed on the accu&s;ation of the&s;e wretches, all prote&s;ting &s;olemnly, at their la&s;t moments, their inno|cence of what they &s;uffered for.</P>
<P>A. D. 1683.] This period is remarkable for a con|&s;piracy to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the King in his way to New-Market, at a place called the <HI>Rye hou&s;e;</HI> which was di&s;covered by Keiling, one of the con&s;pirators. Seve|ral noblemen and gentlemen, that were concerned in this affair, &s;uffered death, among&s;t whom were the Lord Ru&s;&s;el, and the famous Alg$rnon Sidney.</P>
<P>A. D. 1685.] His Maje&s;ty was &s;eized &s;uddenly with an apoplectic fit,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death of Charles <HI>II.</HI></NOTE>, and, after langui&s;hing a few days, died on February 6, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his actual reign, from the re&s;toration. Not|with&s;tanding the errors in this Prince's conduct, and the blemi&s;hes in his character, he was per&s;onally be|loved by his people, who were overwhelmed with grief and a&s;toni&s;hment at his death. This &s;orrow and &s;urpri&s;e co-operating with the terror of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and the dete&s;tation of Popery, ingendered a &s;u&s;picion of his having been taken off by poi&s;on; but this, upon enquiry, appeared without foundation. During his illne&s;s he received the &s;acrament from the hands of a Catholic prie&s;t, and died in that communion.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REIGN OF JAMES II.</HEAD>
<P>A. D. 1685.] Charles dying without legitimate i&s;&s;ue, his brother James Duke of York was proclaimed King without any &s;hadow of oppo&s;ition. On the fir&s;t day of his reign he a&s;&s;embled the council at White|hall.
<PB N="465" REF="502">He di&s;claimed arbitrary principles, declared that he would maintain the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and defend the liberties of the people. He and his Queen were crowned on April 23; when &s;ome people ob&s;er|ved that the royal diadem was too large for his head, and &s;hook from &s;ide to &s;ide, a circum&s;tance from which they deduced a bad omen. The parliament being a&s;&s;embled, the King in his &s;peech confirmed his a&s;&s;urances of maintaining the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and the liberties of the people. The two hou&s;es made an addre&s;s of thanks upon the occa&s;ion, and granted him large &s;upplies for his pre&s;ent emergencies. This year the Earl of Argyle rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection in Scotland; and the Duke of Monmouth landed in the We&s;t of England, and &s;oon after a&s;&s;umed the title of King: but they were both &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and beheaded, and a great many of their adherents &s;uffered death. Nothing could be more flouri&s;hing than the King's pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He had quelled two dangerous rebellions; trampled faction under foot; and obtained a parlia|ment that complied with his de&s;ires. He had a &s;tand|ing army at his command; heard the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance echoed from every corner as articles of the Engli&s;h creed; and found him&s;elf courted by foreign &s;tates. But he had no|thing &s;o much at heart as the conver&s;ion of his people to the Romi&s;h religion. His own zeal was reinforced by the importunities of &s;ome hot-brained Je&s;uits, who had acquired the mo&s;t ab&s;olute influence over his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>A. D. 1686.] The King now admitted four Popi&s;h Lords into his council, viz. the Lords Arundel of Wardour, Bella&s;is, Dover, and the Earl of Tyrconnel. The Roman wor&s;hip was publickly performed, and the Je&s;uits erected colleges in different parts of the king|dom. Four Catholic Bi&s;hops, con&s;ecrated in the King's chapel, were &s;ent through the kingdom, to exerci&s;e their epi&s;copal functions, under the title of
<PB N="466" REF="503">apo&s;tolic vicars. The monks appeared at court in the habits of their orders; and a great number of prie&s;ts and friers arrived in England. The whole ad|mini&s;tration was now managed by real or time-&s;erving Catholics. The King &s;ent a circular letter to the Bi&s;hops, ordering them to prohibit the inferior clergy from preaching on points of controver&s;y. But this injunction was very little regarded by the Prote&s;tant divines, who, &s;eeing their religion in &s;uch imminent danger, expo&s;ed the errors and ab&s;urdities of the Romi&s;h communion, with &s;uch learning, energy, and candour, as operated powerfully on the conviction of the public, and redounded to their own immortal honour. The King and his council were &s;o diplea&s;ed with the&s;e endeavours, that they were re&s;olved to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a new <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion court,</HI> that &s;hould en|force obedience. This was accordingly in&s;tituted, and compo&s;ed of &s;ecular as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical members, among whom were &s;ome Catholics. They were em|powered to exerci&s;e all &s;orts of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;dic|tion; to correct abu&s;es in the &s;piritual law, inquire into all offences, puni&s;h delinquents by cen&s;ure, ex|communication, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and depo&s;ition; to examine &s;tatutes, rules, and charters of colleges, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical communities; and make &s;uch corrections and alterations as they &s;hould think proper. Henry Compton Bi&s;hop of London, being &s;ummoned before the new eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, declined their juri&s;dic|tion, affirming that, as a Bi&s;hop, he was &s;ubject to the metropolitan alone. His plea was over ruled; he was &s;u&s;pended from all epi&s;copal functions, for having di&s;obeyed the King's order, and Nathanael (afterwards Lord) Crew, Thomas Sprat, and Thomas White, Bi&s;hops of Durnam, Roche&s;ter and Peterborough, were ve&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of his dioce&s;e.</P>
<P>To crown all his endeavours in behalf of the Roman communion, James &s;ent Roger Palmer Earl of Ca&s;tle|main,
<PB N="467" REF="504">with a &s;plendid emba&s;&s;y, to the Pope, to acknow|ledge his Maje&s;ty's &s;piritual obedience to his Holine&s;s, and reconcile his kingdoms to the Catholic religion. This noblemen was received at Rome with the mo&s;t mortifying indifference. The Pope was at variance with Lewis XII. the French King, and looked upon James as the partizan and pen&s;ioner of that Monarch. He dreaded the effects of his frantic zeal, and knew his connections with the Je&s;uits, whom Innocent XI. dete&s;ted. Though he granted audience to the am|ba&s;&s;ador, he always pretended to be &s;eized with a fit of coughing, which interrupted the Earl's &s;peech, and obliged him to retire. All that Ca&s;tlemain could ob|tain was a di&s;pen&s;ation, for Father Peters, the King's confe&s;&s;or, permitting him to enjoy a bi&s;hopric, which however he did not obtain. The Pope likewi&s;e &s;ent over a Nuncio to London; a compliment which he could not decently avoid.</P>
<P>A. D. 1687.] Notwith&s;tanding all di&s;couragements, James &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his favourite de&s;ign of convert|ing the three kingdoms; and finding him&s;elf de&s;erted by the church-party, he affected to care&s;s the Pre&s;by|terians. On the fourth of April he publi&s;hed a de|claration for liberty of con&s;cience, and &s;aid he did not doubt of its meeting with the approbation of the parliament. It was &s;o agreeable to all the Non-con|formi&s;ts, that he received the warme&s;t addre&s;&s;es of thanks from the Anabapti&s;ts, Quakers, Independants, and Pre&s;byterians. In the&s;e they extolled the royal power, which they had &s;o long endeavoured to aba&s;e. They triumphed over the churchmen, and publi&s;hed many virulent invectives again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed form of di&s;cipline. The King fomented this difference be|tween two parties, to which he was equally aver&s;e. In private he talked of nothing but the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion to which the Non-conformi&s;ts had been &s;ub|jected by the church of England. He pur&s;ued this artifice &s;o far as to give order for a rever&s;ion of &s;uits
<PB N="468" REF="505">which had been in&s;tituted in eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters. But this animo&s;ity was of &s;hort du|ration; they &s;oon perceived the King's drift, and their mutual re&s;entment &s;ub&s;ided. Some of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops were &s;o abject, as to influence their inferior clergy to &s;end flattering addre&s;&s;es upon the declaration. The King, having hitherto &s;ucceeded beyond even his own expectation, re&s;olved to open a way for the Roman Catholics into the church and univer&s;ities of England. He recommended Father Francis, a Benedictine monk, to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, for the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts. They perceiving the dangerous con|&s;equence of &s;uch an admi&s;&s;ion, pre&s;ented a petition, be|&s;eeching the King to revoke his mandate: and &s;ent a deputation to London, with a remon&s;trance on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Their petition wa di&s;regarded; their depu|ties were denied a hearing; and the Vice Chancellor was &s;ummoned to appear before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court. He was deprived of his office; yet the univer&s;ity &s;till refu&s;ed to admit Francis, and the King thought proper to de&s;i&s;t from his purpo&s;e: but he pro&s;ecuted his at|tempt upon Oxford with more per&s;everance. The place of Pre&s;ident in Magdalen college being vacant, he &s;ent a mandate in favour of one Farmer, a new convert, and who&s;e character, in other re&s;pects, lay under imputation. They petitioned his Maje&s;ty, that they might be allowed to chu&s;e their own Pre&s;ident, according to the &s;tatutes of the college; or that his Maje&s;ty would recommend a per&s;on properly qualified for &s;uch an important office. As no an&s;wer was made to this remon&s;trance, the fellows of the college elected Dr. Hough, a man of learning, integrity, and re&s;olu|tion. The King was incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption: and the Vice Pre&s;ident and fellows were cited before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, for having di&s;obeyed the King's order. They repre&s;ented, that they were re&s;trained from chu&s;ing Farmer by their &s;tatutes, and the nature of the oath they had taken: and proved Farmer in
<PB N="469" REF="506">every re&s;pect unqualified for &s;uch an office. Notwith|&s;tanding their defence, the court decreed that the new Pre&s;ident &s;hould be deprived of his office; and that the Vice-Pre&s;ident and one of the fellows &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended. But the King, being informed of what had appeared to the prejudice of Farmer's character, &s;ent another mandate in favour of Samuel Parker, Bi&s;hop of Oxford, who was as di&s;agreeable as the other. The fellows refu&s;ing to comply with this injunction, the King repaired to Oxford in per&s;on, reproached them with their in&s;olence and di&s;obedience in the mo&s;t im|perious terms, and commanded them to chu&s;e Parker their Pre&s;ident without further delay: but they &s;till re|jected him. His Maje&s;ty then e&s;tabli&s;hed an inferior commi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it the college: and, in &s;hort, the recu&s;ants were all expelled from it, and deprived of their fellow&s;hips, excepting two of them who com|plied. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;entence, the Pre&s;ident refu&s;ed to quit his hou&s;e till he was forcibly expelled. Then the college was filled with Catholics.</P>
<P>The Pope had, in the preceding year, conferred the dignity of Nuncio upon Ferdinand Dada, who had re|&s;ided privately in England, and attended the King's per&s;on ever &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. His Ma|je&s;ty now re&s;olved to pull off the ma&s;k, and produce him in public to his people; though, by the laws of England, no per&s;on could a&s;&s;ume the character of Pope's Nuncio, without incurring the penalty of high trea&s;on. On July 3, this prie&s;t made his public entry into Wind|&s;or, in his pontificals, preceded by the cro&s;s, and at|tended by a great number of Monks in their orders.</P>
<P>A. D. 1688.] In order to demon&s;trate his contempt for the malcontents of the kingdom, James publi&s;hed another declaration for liberty of con&s;cience, and abo|li&s;hing the penal laws: and the Bi&s;hops were enjoined, by an order of council, to cau&s;e this declaration to be read in all churches of their different dioce&s;es. Wil|liam Lloyd Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Thomas Ken of
<PB N="470" REF="507">Bath and Wells, Francis Turner of Ely, John Lake of Chiche&s;ter, Thomas White of Peterborough, and Sir Jonathan Trelawny of Bri&s;tol, being then in Lon|don, no &s;ooner received the&s;e orders, than they ha&s;ten|ed to Lambeth, to con&s;ult with William Sancroft Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. There they deliberated upon the &s;ubject, and agreed in opinion, that they could not obey the King's command, without betray|ing their con&s;ciences, and their duty to God and their country. They therefore drew up and &s;igned a peti|tion to the King, repre&s;enting their unwillingne&s;s to be concerned in publi&s;hing the declaration. They pro|te&s;ted their reluctance did not proceed from any &s;pi|rit of oppo&s;ition to his Maje&s;ty's will, nor to a defect of tenderne&s;s for the Non-conformi&s;ts; but &s;olely from the nature of the declaration it&s;elf, founded on a di&s;|pen&s;ing power, which the parliament, on &s;everal oc|ca&s;ions, had declared illegal. On May 18, they went in a body to the palace, and pre&s;ented this petition to the King, who received and read it with marks of &s;ur|prize and di&s;plea&s;ure. He &s;aid, he did not look for &s;uch an addre&s;s from the church of England, particu|larly from &s;ome among them; that they &s;hould hear from him if he &s;hould change his opinion; if not, he expected they would obey his order. They an&s;wered, that they were re&s;igned to the will of Heaven, and re|tired. An order was &s;oon after given by the council, upon the Bi&s;hops refu&s;ing to retract their petition, for their commitment to the Tower; and the Attorney-General was ordered to pro&s;ecute them for having written and publi&s;hed a &s;editious libel again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty's government. The King re&s;olved they &s;hould be carried to the Tower by water, as the whole city was in commotion. The people were no &s;ooner in|formed of their de&s;tination, than they ran to the &s;ide of the river, which was lined with an incredible multi|tude. As the reverend pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed, the populace fell upon their knees, craving their ble&s;&s;ing, calling
<PB N="471" REF="508">upon Heaven to protect them, and exhorting them to &s;uffer nobly for their religion. A va&s;t croud was a&s;|&s;embled at the Tower, where they were received in the &s;ame manner. The Prelates went immediately to the Tower-chapel, to thank Heaven for tho&s;e afflictions, which, for the &s;ake of religion, they were thought worthy to endure. Soon after the Bi&s;hops were ad|mitted to bail, and June 29 was fixed for their trial. They were attended to We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall by nine and twenty Peers, a great number of gentlemen, and an innumerable croud of people. The cau&s;e was con&s;i|dered as a cri&s;is, that would produce either national &s;lavery or freedom; and therefore it was heard with the mo&s;t eager attention. The di&s;pute was learnedly managed on both &s;ides: and Holloway and Powel, two of the Judges, declared them&s;elves in favour of the Bi&s;hops. The jury withdrew into a chamber, where they pa&s;&s;ed the whole night; but next morning they returned to the court, and pronounced the Bi&s;hops "Not guilty." We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall in&s;tantly rung with loud acclamations, which were communicated through the whole extent of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. The King was greatly chagrined, and publi&s;hed a procla|mation, forbidding the people to a&s;&s;emble in the &s;treets: but notwith&s;tanding this prohibition, the whole city was lighted up by bonfires and illuminations, to the un&s;peakable mortification of James, who threaten|ed to deliver up the Bi&s;hops to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court; and, as a mark of his indignation, deprived Holloway and Powel of their offices.</P>
<P>The King's ob&s;tinacy and per&s;everance &s;eemed to increa&s;e in proportion to the people's oppo&s;ition. His de&s;igning courtiers continually &s;timulated him with in-treaties and exhortations to proceed in the execution of his project; and he was encouraged by the &s;ervice &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions of &s;ome Prote&s;tant divines. The Bi&s;hops of Durham, Roche&s;ter, before-mentioned, and Thomas Cartwright, Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, &s;till approved of all
<PB N="472" REF="509">his mea&s;ures. The clergy of Che&s;hire pre&s;ented an abject addre&s;s, condemning the conduct of the &s;even Prelates who had &s;crupled to publi&s;h the declaration. The Bi&s;hop of Durham &s;u&s;pended thirty mini&s;ters of his dioce&s;e who refu&s;ed to read it: and the inhabitants of Carli&s;le (who&s;e Prelate was Thomas Smith) declared they would concur with his Maje&s;ty in repealing the te&s;t and penal laws. James, far from altering his con|duct, i&s;&s;ued orders for pro&s;ecuting all tho&s;e clergymen who refu&s;ed reading his declaration. Every individual, who knew the value of liberty, and was attached to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, now plainly &s;aw, that, without an immediate and vigorous oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures of the King's mini&s;ters, the nation would be reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of &s;piritual and temporal &s;ubjec|tion. They perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to foreign aid, and looked upon the Prince of Orange as their natural ally and protector. The Prince was no &s;tranger to the murmurs and di&s;contents of the Eng|li&s;h. He had &s;ent over an Envoy on pretence of con|gratulating James on the birth of the Prince of Wales: but had given him &s;ecret in&s;tructions to treat with the chiefs of the malcontents; and the agent executed his commi&s;&s;ion with equal &s;ecre&s;y and &s;ucce&s;s. A formal invitation was &s;ent to the Prince, from great numbers of the nobility and gentry, intreating him to come over and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the recovery of their liberties, and promi&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their lives and fortunes. Even Sunderland, the favourite mini&s;ter of James, is &s;aid to have corre&s;ponded with the Prince, and betray|ed his infatuated ma&s;ter. The Prince began to make preparations; and James was alarmed at his proceed|ings, but could not for &s;ome time believe he intended an inva&s;ion. Being at la&s;t convinced of the Prince's de&s;ign, he made &s;ome preparations for defence. On November 5, the Prince of Orange landed at Brox|holme in Torbay, Devon&s;hire; and was &s;ome days be|fore he was joined by any per&s;ons of di&s;tinction: but
<PB N="473" REF="510">on the tenth day after his landing, when he began to deliberate about reimbarking, he was joined by &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, with bodies of hor&s;emen; and his affairs now a&s;&s;umed a more promi&s;ing a&s;pect.</P>
<P>The unhappy Monarch now found him&s;elf de&s;erted by the greate&s;t part of his nobility; his troops revolted daily; and at la&s;t he was abandoned by his own daugh|ter Anne Prince&s;s of Denmark. When James was made acquainted with the flight of his favourite daugh|ter, he could not help bur&s;ting into tears, and exclaim|ed, in an agony of grief "God help me! my own children have for&s;aken me." He now tottered on the brink of de&s;truction; and, finding him&s;elf in this de|&s;olate &s;ituation, he &s;ent deputies to the Prince of O|range to treat for an accommodation. The Prince &s;ent his propo&s;als, and every thing tended to an agreement, by the King's conce&s;&s;ions; but his re&s;olution was un|happily altered before morning. His private coun|&s;ellors advi&s;ed him to retire into France, where he would be protected by a powerful and generous Monarch, who would enable him to re&s;ume the reins of govern|ment upon his own terms. The Queen embarked on board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, that conveyed her and the Prince of Wales to Calais: and the King, having &s;ent an or|der to di&s;band the army, di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in plain ap|parel, and embarked in a boat at Whitehall. He threw the great &s;eal into the Thames, that it might not fall into the hands of his enemies; and proceeded to|wards the mouth of the river, where a ve&s;&s;el lay for his reception. The ve&s;&s;el in which his Maje&s;ty em|barked barked was detained at Fever&s;ham, by the common people, who di&s;covered Sir Edward Hales on board, and mi&s;took the King for his prie&s;t or chaplain. In this opinion they arre&s;ted, robbed, and in&s;ulted their unfortunate Sovereign: but a con&s;table at la&s;t knowing him, fell at his feet, begging pardon for the people; and they, with marks of contrition, offered to re&s;tore the plunder. He received &s;ome jewels they had taken
<PB N="474" REF="511">from him, but de&s;ired them to keep the money. The news of his being di&s;covered, in &s;uch a manner, had very different effects upon different per&s;ons. The hearts of the people began to relent at the di&s;tre&s;s of their Sovereign. The nobility and magi&s;trates of the city began to fear they had been too officious; and having con&s;ulted together, they deputed four of their number to wait upon his Maje&s;ty, and intreat him to return to Whitehall: and his coaches were immediate|ly di&s;patched to Fever&s;ham. The Prince of Orange &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the King, de&s;iring he would retire to Roche&s;ter, until mea&s;ures could be taken with regard to his affairs. Before this me&s;&s;age was delivered, the King arrived in London, where he was received amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. The Prince of Orange di&s;patched his regiment of Dutch guards to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the two palaces of St. James's and Whitehall: and &s;ent notice to his Maje&s;ty that it would be proper for him to retire to Richmond. He was obliged to acquie&s;ce with the Prince's command; but expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of going to Roche&s;ter. The Prince, perceiving his de&s;ign was to leave the kingdom, readily complied with this reque&s;t, and the King &s;et out for that place. The Prince of Orange the &s;ame day fixed his re&s;idence at St. James's, where he received the compliments of the nobility and the Lord Mayor of London. After having repo&s;ed him&s;elf a few days, he a&s;&s;embled all the nobility, and de&s;ired they would concert proper mea&s;ures for convoking a free parliament for the pre|&s;ervation &s;ervation of the Prote&s;tant religion, and the &s;ecurity of the rights and liberties of the people. They voted an addre&s;s of thanks to his Highne&s;s; and re&s;olved to meet every day in the hou&s;e of Peers, to deliberate up|on what he had recommended to their attention. James, now finding him&s;elf &s;tripped of his authority, re&s;olved to withdraw him&s;elf out of the reach of a people who had renounced his government, and a rival from who&s;e ambition he did not think his life altogether &s;ecure.
<PB N="475" REF="512">On December 23, he privately departed from Ro|che&s;ter, attended by his natural &s;on the Duke of Ber|wick, and two dome&s;tics, to the &s;ea &s;ide, where a ve&s;&s;el was prepared. There embarking he &s;et &s;ail for France, and arrived at the port of Ambletcu&s;e: from whence he repaired to St. Germain, where he found his Queen and the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's departure was no &s;ooner known, than the Peers pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Prince, d$&s;iring he would take into his hands the admini&s;tration of the government, civil and military, until a convention of the e&s;tates &s;hould a&s;&s;emble. Before the Prince would take this &s;tep, he was re&s;olved to be authori&s;ed by the Commons as well as the Peers. He publi&s;hed an or|der, requiring all tho&s;e, who had &s;erved as Members of Parliament in the reign of Charles II. together with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and fifty Common coun|cil-men of the city of London, to meet on December 26, that he might con&s;ult them on the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs. They accordingly a&s;&s;embled at the appoint|ed time, when, after &s;ome debates upon the authority by which they had been convened, they concurred with the re&s;olution of the Peers. Being thus inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme authority, he ordered Barillon the French Amba&s;&s;ador to quit the kingdom immediately. Next day he received the communion in the manner practi&s;ed in the church of England. He publi&s;hed a procla|mation, authori&s;ing all Prote&s;tants, who had public employments, to continue in the exerci&s;e of them, till the meeting of the convention: he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the Catholic officers from the army; and at the &s;ame time he relea&s;ed the Earl of Fever&s;ham.</P>
<P>A. D. 1689.] The Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had hitherto &s;tood neuter, now went, accompanied with eight other prelates, to make a tender of their &s;ervices to the Prince, and &s;ub&s;cribed the a&s;&s;ociation: at the &s;ame time he was complimented by ninety Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, who went in a body to pay their re&s;pects, and
<PB N="476" REF="513">were civilly received. The convention met on Ja|nuary 22, and, each hou&s;e having cho&s;e a Speaker, the Prince's letter was read to this effect: That he had complied with their de&s;ires in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace and public &s;afety of the kingdom; and now it was their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ecure their religion, laws, and liber|ties, upon a &s;ure footing. He ob&s;erved, that the dangerous &s;ituation of the Prote&s;tants in Ireland re|quired immediate relief; and that, except a di&s;union among them&s;elves, nothing could be more prejudicial than a delay in their deliberations: that the States Ge|neral would have immediate occa&s;ion for the troops they had furni&s;hed, as well as for the &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, again&s;t a powerful enemy with whom they were at war: and he per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that, be&s;ides the obligation of treaties, they would be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Dutch as Prote&s;tants and friends, who had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch ardour for the pre&s;ervation of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. Both hou&s;es immedately pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Prince, in which they acknow|ledged, that, under God, the nation was indebted to him for its deliverance. They approved of his admi|ni&s;tration, and begged he would continue to manage the affairs of government, until they &s;hould have oc|ca&s;ion to pre&s;ent another addre&s;s; and they promi&s;ed to pay the utmo&s;t deference to all the contents of his letter. They ordained a day of thank&s;giving for the happy deliverance of the nation; and the Bi&s;hops, by command of the upper hou&s;e, in&s;erted, in the &s;ervice of the day, a particular prayer for the Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>King James had written a letter to his privy coun&s;el|lors, de&s;iring their advice in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. It was printed and publi&s;hed by his direction; but as he received no an&s;wer from tho&s;e to whom it was ad|dre&s;&s;ed, he &s;ent a letter to each hou&s;e of the conven|tion; in which he promi&s;ed, on the word of a King, to grant a general indemnity, even to tho&s;e who had betrayed him, excepting a very few, whom he could
<PB N="477" REF="514">not with &s;afety forgive: but the two hou&s;es refu&s;ed to take the letters into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The Lords debated the que&s;tion, "Whether there was actually an original contract between the King and people?" And it was carried in the affirmative by a majority of &s;even voices. Then they di&s;puted upon the grammatical &s;ignification of the word <HI>abdicated,</HI> and agreed that <HI>de&s;erted</HI> &s;hould be u&s;ed in its place. The next thing they examined was the term <HI>vacant;</HI> and this que&s;tion was propo&s;ed, "Whether, &s;uppo&s;ing King James had violated the original contract between him and his people, and abandoned the government, the throne was thereby become vacant?" the Tories maintained, that, by the laws of England, the King could never die: of con&s;equence the throne could not be vacant; and it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative by a majority of eleven: forty Peers, however, entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this deci&s;ion. Some of the Whig party moved, that, &s;uppo&s;ing King James virtually died, they &s;hould acknowledge the Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange King and Queen of England: but this propo&s;al was rejected by a &s;mall majority. On February 2, the Lords &s;ent down the vote of the Commons, with their amend|ments, which were not approved by the lower hou&s;e. A conference was held, without producing an accom|modation: then the Commons appointed four and twenty members, to maintain the opinions of their hou&s;e, in a new conference; and the Peers nominated the Earls of Nottingham, Clarendon, Roche&s;ter, and Pembroke, the Bi&s;hop of Ely, and &s;ome others, to &s;upport their &s;entiments in favour of the amend|ments they had propo&s;ed. This conference was ma|naged with great ability, on the part of the Commons, by Hambden, Somers, Holt, Maynard, Treby, Sa|cheverel, Pollexfen, Sir Robert Howard, Sir Richard Temple, Foley, and Ayres: yet rather than &s;hock the Tories by attacking their favourite doctrines, they cho&s;e to wave &s;ome &s;trong arguments they might
<PB N="478" REF="515">have drawn from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, the fir&s;t prin|ciples of the con&s;titution, and the natural &s;ight that the people certainly had, in &s;uch emergencies, to pro|vide extraordinary remedies for the pre&s;ervation of the community. The report of this conference, made to the hou&s;e of Peers, produced warm debates: but, at length, the majority agreed to de&s;i&s;t from their amend|ments, and the hou&s;e concurred with the vote of the Commons, "That King James had abdicated the go|vernment, and thereby the throne was become vacant."</P>
<P>The Prince &s;ending for the Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Derby, Shrew&s;bury, and &s;ome other noblemen, told them he had hitherto kept &s;ilence, that he might not &s;eem to interfere with the freedom of their delibe|rations. He &s;aid he knew &s;ome per&s;ons were inclined to a regency, to which he had no objection; but, for his own part, he would not undertake the office. O|thers, he ob&s;erved, were de&s;irous of rai&s;ing the Prin|ce&s;s to the throne; and that he &s;hould reign by her courte&s;y. He declared his great e&s;teem for the Prin|ce&s;s, but he was not of a humour to hold a crown de|pendant upon any woman on earth; nor would he have any &s;hare in the government unle&s;s inve&s;ted with it for life: neverthele&s;s, if they thought proper to act in another manner, he would give them no oppo&s;ition, but return to Holland, without meddling further in their affairs; but in ca&s;e they &s;hould inve&s;t him with the royalty for life, he would agree that the po&s;terity of the Prince&s;s Anne &s;hould be preferred to that which he might have by a &s;econd marriage.</P>
<P>After much altercation, the two hou&s;es agreed, and each voted apart, that the Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould reign jointly as King and Queen of Eng|land; but that the admini&s;tration &s;hould be in the hands of the Prince alone.</P>
