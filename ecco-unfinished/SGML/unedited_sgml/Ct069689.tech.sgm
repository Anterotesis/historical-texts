<HEAD>THE
PREFEACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS an Evidence that 'tis very probable
the&s;e Memorials were written many Years
ago, the Per&s;ons now concerned in the
Publication, a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that they
have had them in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion fini&s;hed,
as they now appear, above twenty Years: That they were
&s;o long ago found by great Accident, among other valu|able
Papers in the Clo&s;et of an eminent publick Mini&s;ter,
of no le&s;s Figure than one of King <HI>William</HI>'s Secretaries
of State.</P>
<P>As it is not proper to trace them any farther, &s;o nei|ther
is there any need to trace them at all, to give Re|putation
to the Story related, &s;eeing the Actions here
mentioned have a &s;ufficient Sanction from all the Hi|&s;tories
of the Times to which they relate, with this Ad|dition,
that the admirable Manner of relating them, and
the wonderful Variety of Incidents, with which they are
beautified in the Cour&s;e of a private Gentleman's Story,
add &s;uch Delight in the reading, and give &s;uch a Lu&s;tre,
as well to the Accounts them&s;elves, as to the Per&s;on who
<PB REF="3">
was the Actor; and no Story, we believe, extant in the
World, ever came abroad with &s;uch Advantages.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t naturally give &s;ome Concern in the reading,
that the Name of a Per&s;on of &s;o much Gallantry and
Honour, and &s;o many Ways valuable to the World,
&s;hould be lo&s;t to the Readers: We a&s;&s;ure them no &s;mall
Labour has been thrown away upon the Enquiry, and
all we have been able to arrive to of Di&s;covery in this
Affair is, that a <HI>Memorandum</HI> was found with this
Manu&s;cript, in the&s;e Words, but not &s;igned by any Name,
only the two Letters of a Name, which gives us no Light
into the Matter, which Memoir was as follows.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<OPENER>Memorandum,</OPENER>
<P>I found this Manu&s;cript among my
Father's Writings, and I under&s;tand
that he got them as Plunder, at, or af|ter,
the Fight at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> where he
&s;erved as Major of&mdash;'s Regiment
of Hor&s;e on the Side of the Parlia|ment.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I. K.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>As this has been of no &V;&s;e but to terminate the Enqui|ry
after the Per&s;on; &s;o, however, it &s;eems mo&s;t naturally to
give an Authority to the Original of the Work, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
that it was born of a Soldier, and indeed it is thro' every
Part, related with &s;o Soldierly a Stile, and in the very
Language of the Field, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible any
Thing, but the very Per&s;on who was pre&s;ent in every
Action here related, could be the Relator of them.</P>
<P>The Accounts of Battles, the Sieges, and the &s;everal
Actions of which this Work is &s;o full, are all recorded in
the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times; &s;uch as the great Battle
of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> the Sacking of <HI>Magdeburgh,</HI> the Siege of
<HI>Nurembergh,</HI> the pa&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Leck</HI> in <HI>Bavaria;</HI>
&s;uch al&s;o as the Battles of <HI>Keynton,</HI> or <HI>Edge-Hill;</HI>
<PB REF="4">
the Battles of <HI>Newberry, Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> and <HI>Na&s;e|by,</HI>
and the like: They are all, we &s;ay, recorded in
other Hi&s;tories, and written by tho&s;e who lived in
tho&s;e Times, and perhaps had good Authority
for what they wrote. But do tho&s;e Relations give
any of the beautiful Ideas of things formed in this
Account? Have they one half of the Circum&s;tances and
Incidents of the Actions them&s;elves, that this Man's
Eyes were Witne&s;s to, and which his Memory has thus
pre&s;erved? He that has read the be&s;t Accounts of tho&s;e
Battles, will be &s;urprized to &s;ee the Particulars of the
Story &s;o pre&s;erved, &s;o nicely, and &s;o agreeably de&s;crib'd;
and will confe&s;s what we alledge, that the Story is in|imitably
told; and even the great Actions of the glori|ous
King <HI>GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS,</HI> receive a
Lu&s;tre from this Man's Relations, which the World
was never made &s;en&s;ible of before, and which the pre|&s;ent
Age has much wanted of late, in Order to give
their Affections a Turn in Favour of his late glorious
Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>In the Story of our own Country's unnatural Wars,
he carries on the &s;ame Spirit. How effectually does he
record the Virtues and glorious Actions of King
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, at the &s;ame Time that he frequently
enters upon the Mistakes of his Maje&s;ty's Conduct, and
of his Friends, which gave his Enemies all tho&s;e fatal
Advantages again&s;t him, which ended in the Over|throw
of his Armies, the Lo&s;s of his Crown and Life,
and the Ruin of the Con&s;titution?</P>
<P>In all his Account he does Ju&s;tice to his Enemies,
and honours the Merit of tho&s;e who&s;e Cau&s;e he fought
again&s;t; and many Accounts recorded in his Story,
are not to be found even in the be&s;t Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e
Times.</P>
<P>What Applau&s;e does he give to the Gallantry of Sir
<HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> to his Mode&s;ty, to his Conduct, under
<PB REF="5">
which he him&s;elf was &s;ubdued, and to the Ju&s;tice he did
the King's Troops when they laid down their Arms?</P>
<P>His De&s;cription of the <HI>Scots</HI> Troops in the beginning
of the War, and the Behaviour of the Party under the
Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who went over again&s;t them, are ad|mirable;
and his Cen&s;ure of their Conduct, who pu&s;h'd
the King upon the Quarrel, and then would not let him
fight, is no more than what many of the King's Friends,
tho' le&s;s knowing [as Soldiers, have often complained of.]</P>
<P>In a Word, this Work is a Confutation of many Er|rors
in all the Writers upon the Subject of our Wars in
<HI>England,</HI> and even in that extraordinary Hi&s;tory
written by the Earl of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> but the Editors
were &s;o ju&s;t, that when near twenty Years ago, a Per&s;on
who had written a whole Volume in Folio, by Way of
An&s;wer to, and Confutation of <HI>Clarendon's</HI> Hi&s;tory of
the Rebellion, would have borrowed the Clau&s;es in this
Account, which cla&s;h with that Hi&s;tory, and confront
it: We &s;ay the Editors were &s;o ju&s;t as to refu&s;e
them.</P>
<P>There can be nothing objected again&s;t the general
Credit of this Work, &s;eeing its Truth is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon
univer&s;al Hi&s;tory; and almo&s;t all the Facts, e&s;pecially
tho&s;e of Moment, are confirmed for their general Part by
all the Writers of tho&s;e Times, if they are here embelli&s;hed
with Particulars, which are no where el&s;e to be found,
that is the Beauty we boa&s;t of; and that it is that mu&s;t
recommend this Work to all the Men of Sen&s;e and
Judgment that read it.</P>
<P>The only Objection we find po&s;&s;ible to make again&s;t
this Work is, that it is not carried on farther; or, as we
may &s;ay fini&s;hed, with the fini&s;hing the War of the Time;
and this we complain of al&s;o: But then we complain as
a Misfortune to the World, not as a Fault in the Author;
for how do we know but that this Author might carry it
on, and have another Part fini&s;hed which might not
fall into the &s;ame Hands, or may &s;till remain with
<PB REF="6" MS="Y">
&s;ome of his Family, and which they cannot indeed publi&s;h,
to make it &s;eem any Thing perfect, for want of the other
Part which we have, and which we have now made pub|lick?
Nor is it very improbable, but that if any &s;uch
farther Part is in Being, the publi&s;hing the&s;e Two Parts
may occa&s;ion the Proprietors of the Third to let the World
&s;ee it; and that by &s;uch a Di&s;covery, the Name of the
Per&s;on may al&s;o come to be known, which would, no doubt,
be a great Satisfaction to the Reader, as well as us.</P>
<P>This, however, mu&s;t be &s;aid, that if the &s;ame Au|thor
&s;hould have written another Part of this Work, and
carried it on to the End of tho&s;e Times; yet as the Re|&s;idue
of tho&s;e melancholly Days, to the Re&s;toration, were
filled with the Intrigues of Government, the Political Ma|nagement
of illegal Power, and the Di&s;&s;entions and Fa|ctions
of a People, who were then even in them&s;elves
but a <HI>FACTION,</HI> and that there was very little
Action in the Field; it is more than probable that our
Author, who was a Man of Arms, had little Share in
tho&s;e Things, and might not care to trouble him&s;elf
with looking at them.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all this, it might happen that he might
go abroad again, at that Time, as mo&s;t of the Gentlemen
of Quality, and who had an Abhorrence for the Power
that then govern'd, here did. Nor are we certain that
he might live to the End of that Time, &s;o we can give
no Account whether he had any Po&s;t in the &s;ub&s;equent
Actions of that Time.</P>
<P>'Tis enough that we have the Authorities above to re|commend
this Part to us that is now publi&s;hed; the Rela|tion,
we are per&s;waded, will recommend it &s;elf, and no|thing
more can be needful, becau&s;e nothing more can
invite than the Story it &s;elf, which when the Reader en|ters
into, he will find it very hard to get out of, 'till
he has gone thro' it.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>_IT may &s;uffice the Reader, with|out
being very inqui&s;itive after
my Name, that I was born in
the County of <HI>SALOP,</HI> in
the Year 1608; under the Go|vernment
of what Star I was
never A&s;trologer enough to exa|mine;
but the Con&s;equences of my Life may
allow me to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome extraordinary
Influence affected my Birth. If there be any
thing in Dreams al&s;o, my Mother, who was
mighty ob&s;ervant that Way, took Minutes, which
I have &s;ince &s;een in the fir&s;t Leaf of her Prayer
Book, of &s;everal &s;trange Dreams &s;he had while &s;he
was with Child of her &s;econd Son, which was my
<PB N="2" REF="8">
&s;elf. Once &s;he noted that &s;he dreamed &s;he was
carried away by a Regiment of Hor&s;e, and de|livered
in the Fields of a Son, that as &s;oon as
it was born had two Wings came out of its Back,
and in half an Hour's Time flew away from her:
And the very Evening before I was born, &s;he dream|ed
&s;he was brought to Bed of a Son, and that all
the while &s;he was in Labour a Man &s;tood under her
Window beating on a Kettle-Drum, which very
much di&s;compo&s;ed her.</P>
<P>My Father was a Gentleman of a very plen|tiful
Fortune, having an E&s;tate of above 5000
Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> of a Family nearly allied to
&s;everal of the principal Nobility, and lived about
&s;ix Miles from the Town: And my Mother be|ing
at&mdash;on &s;ome particular Occa&s;ion, was &s;ur|prized
there at a Friend's Hou&s;e, and brought
me very &s;afe into the World.</P>
<P>I was my Father's &s;econd Son, and therefore
was not altogether &s;o much &s;lighted as younger
Sons of good Families generally are. But my
Father &s;aw &s;omething in my Genius al&s;o which
particularly plea&s;ed him, and &s;o made him take
extraordinary Care of my Education.</P>
<P>I was taught therefore, by the be&s;t Ma&s;ters
that could be had, every Thing that was needful
to accompli&s;h a young Gentleman for the World;
and at &s;eventeen Years old my Tutor told my Fa|ther
an Academick Education was very proper
for a Per&s;on of Quality, and he thought me very
fit for it: So my Father entered me of&mdash;College
in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I continued three Years.</P>
<P>A Collegiate Life did not &s;uit me at all, though
I loved Books well enough. It was never de|&s;igned
that I &s;hould be either a Lawyer, Phy|&s;ician
or Divine; and I wrote to my Father,
that I thought I had &s;taid there long enough
<PB N="3" REF="9">
for a Gentleman, and with his Leave I de&s;ired
to give him a Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>During my Stay at <HI>Oxford,</HI> though I pa&s;&s;ed
through the proper Exerci&s;es of the Hou&s;e, yet
my chief reading was upon Hi&s;tory and Geogra|phy,
as that which plea&s;ed my Mind be&s;t, and
&s;upplied me with Ideas mo&s;t &s;uitable to my Ge|nius:
By one I under&s;tood what great Actions had
been done in the World; and by the other I
under&s;tood where they had been done.</P>
<P>My Father readily complied with my De&s;ire
of coming home; for be&s;ides that he thought,
as I did, that three Years time at the Univer&s;ity
was enough, he al&s;o mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately loved me,
and began to think of my &s;ettling near him.</P>
<P>At my Arrival I found my &s;elf extraordinarily
care&s;&s;ed by my Father, and he &s;eemed to take
a particular Delight in my Conver&s;ation. My
Mother, who lived in a perfect Union with him,
both in De&s;ires and Affection, received me very
pa&s;&s;ionately: Apartments were provided for me
by my &s;elf, and Hor&s;es and Servants allowed me
in particular.</P>
<P>My Father never went a Hunting, an Exerci&s;e
he was exceeding fond of, but he would have
me with him; and it plea&s;ed him when he found
me like the Sport. I lived thus, in all the Plea|&s;ures
'twas po&s;&s;ible for me to enjoy, for about
a Year more; when going out one Morning with
my Father to hunt a Stag, and having had a very
hard Cha&s;e, and gotten a great Way off from
home, we had Lei&s;ure enough to ride gently
back: And as we returned, my Father took Oc|ca&s;ion
to enter into a &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e with
me concerning the Manner of my &s;ettling in
the World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10">
He told me, with a great deal of Pa&s;&s;ion, that
he loved me above all the re&s;t of his Children,
and that therefore he intended to de very well
for me; that my elde&s;t Brother being already
married and &s;ettled, he had de&s;igned the &s;ame for
me, and propo&s;ed a very advantageous Match for
me with a young Lady of very extraordinary
Fortune and Merit, and offered to make a Set|tlement
of 2000 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> on me, which he
&s;aid he would purcha&s;e for me without dimini&s;h|ing
his paternal E&s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>There was too much Tenderne&s;s in this Di&s;|cour&s;e
not to affect me exceedingly. I told him,
I would perfectly re&s;ign my &s;elf unto his Di&s;|po&s;al.
But, as my Father had, together with his
Love for me, a very nice Judgment in his Di&s;|cour&s;e,
he fixed his Eyes very attentively on
me; and though my An&s;wer was without the
lea&s;t Re&s;erve, yet he thought he &s;aw &s;ome Un|ea&s;ine&s;s
in me at the Propo&s;al, and from thence
concluded that my Compliance was rather an
Act of Di&s;cretion than Inclination; and, that
however I &s;eemed &s;o ab&s;olutely given up to what
he had propo&s;ed, yet my An&s;wer was really an
Effect of my Obedience rather than my Choice:
So he returned very quick upon me,</HI> Look you,
Son, though I give you my own Thoughts in the Matter,
yet I would have you be very plain with me; for if your
ewn Choice does not agree with mine, I will be your Ad|vi&s;er,
but will never impo&s;e upon you; and therefore let
me know your Mind freely. I don't reckon my &s;elf ca|pable,
Sir, <HI>&s;aid I, with a great deal of re&s;pect,</HI> to
make &s;o good a Choice for my &s;elf as you can for me;
and though my Opinion differed from yours, its being
your Opinion would reform mine, and my Judgment
would as readily comply as my Duty. I gather at least
from thence, <HI>&s;aid my Father,</HI> that your De&s;igns lay
<PB N="5" REF="11">
another Way before, however they may comply with mine:
And therefore I would know what it was you would have
asked of me if I had not offered this to you; and you mu&s;t
not deny me your Obedience in this, if you expect I &s;hould
believe your Readine&s;s in the other.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> 'twas impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould lay out for my
&s;elf ju&s;t what you have propo&s;ed; but if my Inclinations
were never &s;o contrary, though at your Command you &s;hall
know them, yet I declare them to be wholly &s;ubjected to
your Order: I confe&s;s my Thoughts did not tend towards
Marriage or a Settlement; for though I had no Rea|&s;on
to que&s;tion your Care of me, yet I thought a Gentle|man
ought always to &s;ee &s;omething of the World before
he confined him&s;elf to any part of it: And if I had been
to ask your Con&s;ent to any Thing, it &s;hould have been to
give me leave to Travel for a &s;hort Time, in order
qualifie my &s;elf to appear at home like a Son to &s;o good
a Father.</P>
<P>In what Capacity woul you Travel, <HI>replied my Fa|ther?</HI>
You mu&s;t go abroad either as a private Gentleman,
as a Scholar, or as a Soldier. If it were in the latter
Capacity, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I, returning pretty quick,</HI> I hope
I &s;hould not misbehave my &s;elf; but I am not &s;o deter|mined
as not to be ruled by your Judgment. Truly, <HI>re|plied
my Father,</HI> I &s;ee no War abroad at this Time
worth while for a Man to appear in, whether we talk of
the Cau&s;e or the Encouragement; and indeed, Son, I am
afraid you need not go far for Adventures of that Na|ture,
for Times &s;eem to look as if this Part of <HI>Europe</HI>
would find us Work enough. My Father &s;pake then rela|ting
to the Quarrel likely to happen between the King of
<HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> (<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Upon the Breach of the Match between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the Infanta of <HI>Spain;</HI> and particularly upon the old Quarrel of the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and the <HI>Palatinate.</HI></NOTE>) for I believe he had
no Notions of a Civil War in his Head.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12">
In &s;hort, my Father perceiving my Inclinati|ons
very forward to go abroad, gave me Leave
to Travel, upon Condition I would promi&s;e to
return in two Years at farthe&s;t, or &s;ooner, if he
&s;ent for me.</P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Oxford</HI> I happened into the So|ciety
of a young Gentleman, of a good Family,
but of a low Fortune, being a younger Brother, and
who had indeed in&s;tilled into me the fir&s;t De|&s;ires
of going abroad, and who I knew pa&s;&s;ionate|ly
longed to Travel, but had not &s;ufficient Al|lowance
to defray his Expences as a Gentleman.
We had contracted a very clo&s;e Friend&s;hip, and
our Humours being very agreeable to one ano|ther,
we daily enjoyed the Conver&s;ation of Let|ters.
He was of a generous free Temper, with|out
the lea&s;t Affectation or Deceit, a hand&s;ome
proper Per&s;on, a &s;trong Body, very good Mien,
and brave to the la&s;t Degree: His Name was
<HI>Fielding,</HI> and we called him <HI>Captain,</HI> though it be
a very unufual Title in a College; but Fate had
&s;ome Hand in the Title, for he had certainly
the Lines of a Soldier drawn in his Counte|nance.
I imparted to him the Re&s;olutions
I had taken, and how I had my Father's Con&s;ent
to go abroad; and would know his Mind, whe|ther
he would go with me: He &s;ent me Word,
he would go with all his Heart.</P>
<P>My Father, when he &s;aw him, for I &s;ent for
him immediately to come to me, mightily appro|ved
my Choice; &s;o we got our Equipage ready,
and came away for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas on the 22d of <HI>April</HI> 1630, when we em|barked
at <HI>Dover,</HI> landed in a few Hours at <HI>Calais,</HI>
and immediately took Po&s;t for <HI>Paris.</HI> I &s;hall not
trouble the Reader with a Journal of my Tra|vels,
nor with the De&s;cription of Places; which
<PB N="7" REF="13">
every Geographer can do better than I; but
the&s;e Memoirs being only a Relation of what hap|pened
either to our &s;elves, or in our own Know|ledge,
I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to that Part of it.</P>
<P>We had indeed &s;ome diverting Pa&s;&s;ages in our
Journey to <HI>Paris;</HI> as fir&s;t, the Hor&s;e my Comrade
was upon fell &s;o very lame with a Slip that he
could not go, and hardly &s;tand: And the Fel|low
that rid with us Expre&s;s, pretended to ride
away to a Town five Miles off to get a fre&s;h
Hor&s;e, and &s;o left us on the Road with one Hor&s;e
between two of us: We followed as well as we
could, but being Strangers, mi&s;&s;ed the Way, and
wandered a great Way out of the Road. Whe|ther
the Man performed in rea&s;onable Time, or
not, we could not be &s;ure; but if it had not
been for an old Prie&s;t, we had never found him.
We met this Man, by a very good Accident,
near a little Village whereof he was Curate: We
&s;poke <HI>Latin</HI> enough ju&s;t to make him under&s;tand
us, and he did not &s;peak it much better him&s;elf;
but he carried us into the Village to his Hou&s;e,
gave us Wine and Bread, and entertained us with
wonderful Courte&s;ie: After this he &s;ent in|to
the Village, hired a Pea&s;ant, and a Hor&s;e for
my Captain, and &s;ent him to guide us into the
Road. At parting he made a great many Com|pliments
to us in <HI>French,</HI> which we could ju&s;t un|der&s;tand;
but the Sum was, to excu&s;e him for
a Que&s;tion he had a mind to ask us. After
leave to ask what he plea&s;ed, it was, if we want|ed
any Money for our Journey, and pulled out
two Pi&s;toles, which he offered either to give or
lend us.</P>
<P>I mention this exceeding Courte&s;ie of the Cu|rate,
becau&s;e, though Civility is very much in
U&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> and e&s;pecially to Strangers, yet
<PB N="8" REF="14">
'tis a very unu&s;ual thing to have them part with
their Money.</P>
<P>We let the Prie&s;t know, fir&s;t, that we did not
want Money, and next that we were very
&s;en&s;ible of the Obligation he had put upon us;
and I told him in particular, if I lived to &s;ee
him again, I would acknowledge it.</P>
<P>This Accident of our Hor&s;e, was, as we after|wards
found, of &s;ome u&s;e to us: We had left
our two Servants behind us at <HI>Calais</HI> to bring our
Baggage after us, by rea&s;on of &s;ome Di&s;pute be|tween
the Captain of the Pacquet and the
Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer which could not be
adju&s;ted; and we were willing to be at <HI>Paris:</HI>
The Fellows followed as fa&s;t as they could, and
as near as we could learn, in the Time we lo&s;t
our Way were robbed, and our Portmanteaus
opened. They took what they plea&s;ed; but
as there was no Money there, but Linen and Ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
the Lo&s;s was not great.</P>
<P>Our Guide carried us to <HI>Amiens,</HI> where we
found the Expre&s;s and our two Servants, who
the Expre&s;s meeting on the Road with a &s;pare
Hor&s;e, had brought back with him thither.</P>
<P>We took this for a good Omen of our &s;uc|ce&s;sful
Journey, having e&s;caped a Danger which
might have been greater to us than it was to our
Servants; for the Highway-Men in <HI>France</HI> do
not always give a Traveller the Civility of
bidding him Stand and Deliver his Money, but
frequently Fire upon him fir&s;t, and then take
his Money.</P>
<P>We &s;taid one Day at <HI>Amiens,</HI> to adju&s;t this
little Di&s;order, and walked about the Town,
and into the great Church, but &s;aw nothing
very remarkable there; but going cro&s;s a broad
Street near the great Church, we &s;aw a Crowd of
<PB N="9" REF="15">
People gazing at a Mountebank Doctor who
made a long Harangue to them with a thou&s;and
antick Po&s;tures, and gave out Bills this Way,
and Boxes of Phy&s;ick that Way, and had a great
Trade, when on a &s;udden the People rai&s;ed a
Cry,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In English, <HI>Thief, Thief,</HI></NOTE> <HI>Larron, Larron,</HI> on the other &s;ide the
Street, and all the Auditors ran away from Mr.
Doctor, to &s;ee what the matter was&mdash;Among
the re&s;t, we went to &s;ee; and the ca&s;e was plain
and &s;hort enough. Two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen,
and a <HI>Scotch-Man,</HI> Travellers as we were, were
&s;tanding gazing at this prating Doctor, and one
of them catched a Fellow picking his Pocket:
The Fellow had got &s;ome of his Money, for he
dropt two or three Pieces ju&s;t by him, and had
got hold of his Watch; but being &s;urprized,
let it &s;lip again: but the Rea&s;on of telling this
Story, is for the Management of it. This Thief
had his Seconds &s;o ready, that as &s;oon as the
<HI>Engli&s;h-Man</HI> had &s;eized him, they fell in, pre|tended
to be mighty zealous for the Stranger,
takes the Fellow by the Throat, and makes a
great Bu&s;tle; the Gentleman not doubting but
the Man was &s;ecured, let go his own Hold of
him, and left him to them: The Hubbub was
great, and 'twas the&s;e Fellows cried <HI>Larron, Lar|ron;</HI>
but with a Dexterity peculiar to them&s;elves,
had let the right Fellow go, and pretended to
be all upon one of their own Gang. At la&s;t
they bring the Man to the Gentleman, to ask
him what the Fellow had done? who, when he
&s;aw the Per&s;on they &s;eized on, pre&s;ently told
them that was not the Man: Then they &s;eemed
to be in more Con&s;ternation than before, and
&s;pread them&s;elves all over the Street, crying
<PB N="10" REF="16">
<HI>Larron, Larron,</HI> pretending to &s;earch for the Fellow;
and &s;o one one Way, one another, they were all
gone, the Noi&s;e went over, the Gentlemen &s;tood
looking one at another, and the bawling Doctor
began to have the Crowd about him again.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t <HI>French</HI> Trick I had the Op|portunity
of &s;eeing; but I was told they have
a great many more as dextrous as this.</P>
<P>We &s;oon got Acquaintance with the&s;e Gentle|men,
who were going to <HI>Paris</HI> as well as we; &s;o
the next Day we made up our Company with
them, and were a pretty Troop of five Gentle|men
and four Servants.</P>
<P>As we had really no De&s;ign to &s;tay long at
<HI>Paris,</HI> &s;o indeed, excepting the City it &s;elf, there
was not much to be &s;een there. Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI>
who was not only a &s;upreme Mini&s;ter in the
Church, but prime Mini&s;ter in the State, was
now made al&s;o General of the King's Forces, with
a Title never known in <HI>France</HI> before nor &s;ince,
<HI>viz.</HI> Lieutenant-General <HI>au Place du Roy,</HI> in the
King's &s;tead, or as &s;ome have &s;ince tran&s;lated it,
repre&s;enting the Per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P>Under this Character he pretended to exe|cute
all the Royal Powers in the Army without
Appeal to the King, or without waiting for
Orders: and having parted from <HI>Paris</HI> the
Winter before, had now actually begun the War
again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> in the proce&s;s of
which, he re&s;tored the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and
having taken <HI>Pignerol</HI> from the Duke, put it into
&s;uch a &s;tate of Defence, as the Duke could never
force it out of his hands, and reduced the Duke,
rather by Manage and Conduct than by Force,
to make Peace without it; &s;o as annexing it to
the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> it has ever &s;ince been a
Thorn in his Foot, that has always made the
<PB N="11" REF="17">
Peace of <HI>Savoy</HI> lame and precarious: and <HI>France</HI>
has &s;ince made <HI>Pignerol</HI> one of the &s;tronge&s;t
Fortre&s;&s;es in the World.</P>
<P>As the Cardinal, with all the Military part
of the Court, was in the Field; &s;o the King,
to be near him, was gone with the Queen and
all the Court, ju&s;t before I reached <HI>Paris,</HI> to re&s;ide
at <HI>Lyons.</HI> All the&s;e con&s;idered, there was no|thing
to do at <HI>Paris:</HI> the Court looked like a
Citizen's Hou&s;e when the Family was all gone
into the Country: and I thought the whole City
looked very melancholy, compared to all the
fine things I had heard of it.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother and her Party were
chagrin at the Cardinal, who, tho' he owed his
Grandeur to her immediate Favour, was now
grown too great any longer to be at the Com|mand
of Her Maje&s;ty, or indeed in her Intere&s;t;
and therefore the Queen was under Di&s;&s;atisfa|ction,
and Her Party looked very much down.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants were every where di&s;con|&s;olate;
for the Lo&s;&s;es they had received at
<HI>Rochel, Ni&s;mes,</HI> and <HI>Montpelier,</HI> had reduced them
to an ab&s;olute Dependence on the King's Will,
without all po&s;&s;ible hopes of ever recovering
them&s;elves, or being &s;o much as in a Condition
to take Arms for their Religion; and therefore
the wi&s;e&s;t of them plainly fore&s;aw their own
entire Reduction, as it &s;ince came to pa&s;s: and I
remember vere well, that a Prote&s;tant Gentle|man
told me once, as we were pa&s;&s;ing from
<HI>Orleans</HI> to <HI>Lyons,</HI> That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had ruined
them; and therefore, &s;ays he, I think the next
Occa&s;ion the King takes to u&s;e us ill, as I know
'twill not be long, before he does, we mu&s;t
all fly over to <HI>England,</HI> where you are bound
to maintain us for having helped to turn us out
<PB N="12" REF="18">
of our own Country. I asked him what he
meant by &s;aying the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had done it? He
returned &s;hort upon me; I do not mean, &s;ays
he, by not relieving <HI>Rochel,</HI> but by helping to
ruin <HI>Rochel,</HI> when you and the <HI>Dutch</HI> lent Ships
to beat our Fleet, which all the Ships in <HI>France</HI>
could not have done without you.</P>
<P>I was too young in the World to be very &s;en&s;i|ble
of this before, and therefore was &s;omething
&s;tartled at the Charge; but when I came to di&s;|cour&s;e
with this Gentleman, I &s;oon &s;aw, the
Truth of what he &s;aid was undeniable, and have
&s;ince reflected on it with regret, that the Naval
Power of the Prote&s;tants, which was then &s;upe|rior
to the Royal, would certainly have been the
Recovery of all their Fortunes, had it not been
unhappily broke by their Brethren of <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Holland,</HI> the former lending &s;even Men of War,
and the latter twenty, for the De&s;truction of the
<HI>Rocheller</HI>'s Fleet; and by tho&s;e very Ships the
<HI>Rocheller</HI>'s Fleet were actually beaten and de|&s;troyed,
and they never afterward recovered
their Force at Sea, and by con&s;equence &s;unk
under the Siege, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> afterwards in
vain attempted to prevent.</P>
<P>The&s;e things made the Prote&s;tants look very
dull, and expected the Ruin of all their Party;
which had certainly happened had the Cardinal
lived a few Years longer.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed in <HI>Paris</HI> about three Weeks, as well
to &s;ee the Court, and what Rarities the Place
afforded, as by an Occa&s;ion which had like to
have put a &s;hort Period to our Ramble.</P>
<P>Walking one Morning before the Gate of
the <HI>Louvre,</HI> with a De&s;ign to &s;ee the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Drawn
up, which they always did, and Exerci&s;ed ju&s;t
before they Relieved the Guards; a Page came up
<PB N="13" REF="19">
to me, and &s;peaking <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to me, Sir, &s;ays he
the Captain mu&s;t needs have your immediate
A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I that had not the knowledge of any
Per&s;on in <HI>Paris</HI> but my own Companion, whom I
called Captain, had no room to que&s;tion, but it
was he that &s;ent for me; and crying out ha&s;tily
to him, Where, followed the Fellow as fa&s;t as
'twas po&s;&s;ible: he led me thro' &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages
which I knew not, and at la&s;t thro' a Tennis-Court,
and into a large Room where three Men,
like Gentlemen, were Engaged very briskly,
two again&s;t one: the Room was very dark, &s;o
that I could not ea&s;ily know them a&s;under; but
being fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an Opinion before of
my Captain's Danger, I ran into the Room with
my Sword in my Hand: I had not particular|ly
Engaged any of them, nor &s;o much as made
a Pa&s;s at any, when I received a very dangerous
Thru&s;t in my Thigh, rather occa&s;ioned by my
ha&s;ty running in, than a real De&s;ign of the
Per&s;on; but enraged at the Hurt, without
examining who it was hurt me, I threw my &s;elf
upon him, and run my Sword quite thro' his
Body.</P>
<P>The Novelty of the Adventure, and the
unexpected Fall of the Man by a Stranger come
in no Body knew how, had becalmed the other
two, that they really &s;tood gazing at me. By
this Time I had di&s;covered that my Captain
was not there, and that 'twas &s;ome &s;trange
Accident brought me thither. I could &s;peak
but little <HI>French,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed they could &s;peak
no <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> &s;o I &s;tepped to the Door to &s;ee for the
Page that brought me thither: but &s;eeing no
body there, and the Pa&s;&s;age clear, I made off as
fa&s;t as I could, without &s;peaking a Word; nor
did the other two Gentlemen offer to &s;top me.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20">
But I was in a &s;trange Confu&s;ion when coming
into tho&s;e Entries and Pa&s;&s;ages which the Page
led me thro', I could by no means find my way
out; at la&s;t &s;eeing a Door open that looked
through a Hou&s;e into the Street, I went in, and
out at the other Door; but then I was at as
great a Lo&s;s to know where I was, and which
was the way to my Lodging. The Wound in my
Thigh bled apace, and I could feel the Blood in
my Breeches. In this Interval came by a
Chair, I called, and went into it, and bid them,
as well as I could, go to the <HI>Louvre;</HI> for tho' I
knew not the Name of the Street were I lodged,
I knew I could find the way to it when I was
at the <HI>Ba&s;tile.</HI> The Chair-Men went on their
own Way, and being &s;topp'd by a Company of the
Guards as they went, &s;et me down till the Soul|diers
were marched by; when looking out I found
I was ju&s;t at my own Lodging, and the Captain
was &s;tanding at the Door looking for me; I beckon|ed
him to me, and whi&s;pering told him I was
very much hurt, but bid him pay the Chair|men,
and ask no Que&s;tions but come to me.</P>
<P>I made the be&s;t of my Way up Stairs, but had
lo&s;t &s;o much Blood that I had hardly Spirits
enough to keep me from &s;wooning till he came
in: He was equally concerned with me to &s;ee
me in &s;uch a bloody Condition, and pre&s;ently
called up our Landlord, and he as quickly called
in his Neighbours, that I had a Room full of
People about me in a quarter of an Hour. But
this had like to have been of wor&s;e Con&s;equence
to me than the other; for by this Time there
was great enquiring after the Per&s;on who killed
a Man at the Tennis-Court. My Landlord was
then &s;en&s;ible of his Mi&s;take, and came to me,
and told me the Danger I was in, and very hone&s;t|ly
<PB N="15" REF="21">
offered to convey me to a Friend's of his,
where I &s;hould be very &s;ecure; I thanked him,
and &s;uffered my &s;elf to be carried at Midnight
whether he plea&s;ed; he vi&s;ited me very often
till I was well enough to walk about, which was
not in le&s;s than ten Days, and then we thought
fit to be gone, &s;o we took Po&s;t for <HI>Orleans;</HI> but
when I came upon the Road I found my &s;elf in
a new Error, for my Wound opened again with
riding, and I was in a wor&s;e Condition than be|fore,
being forced to take up at a little Village
on the Road, called about Miles from
<HI>Orleans,</HI> where there was no Surgeon to be had,
but a &s;orry Country Barber, who neverthele&s;s
dre&s;&s;ed me as well as he could, and in about a
Week more I was able to walk to <HI>Orleans</HI> at three
times.</P>
<P>Here I &s;taid till I was quite well, and then
took Coach for <HI>Lyons,</HI> and &s;o through <HI>Savoy</HI> into
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;pent near two Years Time after this bad be|ginning
in travelling through <HI>Italy,</HI> and to the
&s;everal Courts of <HI>Rome, Naples, Venice</HI> and <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Lyons</HI> the King was gone from
thence to <HI>Grenoble</HI> to meet the Cardinal, but the
Queens were both at <HI>Lyons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Affairs &s;eemed at this Time to
have but an indifferent A&s;pect; there was no
Life in any Thing but where the Cardinal was,
he pu&s;hed on every Thing with extraordinary
Conduct, and generally with Succe&s;s; he had
taken <HI>Suza</HI> and <HI>Pignerol</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Sa|voy,</HI>
and was preparing to pu&s;h the Duke even out
of all his Dominions.</P>
<P>But in the mean Time every where el&s;e
Things looked ill; the Troops were ill paid,
the Magazines empty, the People mutinous, and
<PB N="16" REF="22">
a general Di&s;order &s;eized the Minds of the
Court; and the Cardinal, who was the Soul of
every Thing, de&s;ired this Interview at <HI>Grenoble,</HI>
in order to put Things into &s;ome better Method.</P>
<P>This politick Mini&s;ter always ordered Mat|ters
&s;o, that if there was Succe&s;s in any Thing
the Glory was his; but if Things mi&s;carried it
was all laid upon the King. This Conduct was
&s;o much the more Nice, as it is the direct con|trary
to the Cu&s;tom in like Ca&s;es, where Kings
a&s;&s;ume the Glory of all the Succe&s;s in an Acti|on;
and when a Thing mi&s;carries make them|&s;elves
ea&s;ie by &s;acrificing their Mini&s;ters and Fa|vourites
to the Complaints and Re&s;entments of
the People; but this accurate refined State&s;man
got over this Point.</P>
<P>While we were at <HI>Lyons,</HI> and as I remember,
the third Day after our coming thither, we had
like to have been involved in a State Broil, with|out
knowing where we were; it was of a <HI>Sun|day</HI>
in the Evening, the People of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who
had been &s;orely oppre&s;&s;ed in Taxes, and the War
in <HI>Italy</HI> pinching their Trade, began to be very
tumultuous; we found the Day before the Mob
got together in great Crouds, and talked oddly;
the King was every where reviled, and &s;poken
di&s;re&s;pectfully of, and the Magi&s;trates of the Ci|ty
either winked at, or dur&s;t not attempt to
meddle, left they &s;hould provoke the People.</P>
<P>But on <HI>Sunday</HI> Night, about Midnight, we was
waked by a prodigious Noi&s;e in the Street; I
jumpt out of Bed, and running to the Window,
I &s;aw the Street as full of Mob as it could hold,
&s;ome armed with Mu&s;quets and Halbards, march|ed
in very good Order; others in di&s;orderly
Crouds, all &s;houting and crying out <HI>du Paix le
Roy,</HI> and the like: One that led a great Party
<PB N="17" REF="23">
of this Rabble carried a Loaf of Bread upon the
Top of a Pike, and other le&s;&s;er Loaves, &s;igni|fying
the Smallne&s;s of their Bread, occa&s;ioned
by Dearne&s;s.</P>
<P>By Morning this Croud was gathered to a
great Heighth, they run roving over the whole
City, &s;hut up all the Shops, and forced all the
People to join with them from thence; they
went up to the Ca&s;tle, and renewing the Cla|mour,
a &s;trange Con&s;ternation &s;eized all the
Princes.</P>
<P>They broke open the Doors of the Officers,
Collectors of the new Taxes, and plundered their
Hou&s;es, and had not the Per&s;ons them&s;elves fled
in time they had been very ill treated.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother, as &s;he was very much di&s;|plea&s;ed
to &s;ee &s;uch Con&s;equences of the Govern|ment,
in who&s;e Management &s;he had no Share,
&s;o I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had the le&s;s Concern upon her.
However, &s;he came into the Court of the Ca&s;tle
and &s;hewed her &s;elf to the People, gave Money
among&s;t them, and &s;poke gently to them; and
by a Way peculiar to her &s;elf, and which obli|ged
all &s;he talked with, &s;he pacified the Mob
gradually, &s;ent them home with Promi&s;es of Re|dre&s;s
and the like; and &s;o appea&s;ed this Tu|mult
in two Days, by her Prudence, which the
Guards in the Ca&s;tle had &s;mall Mind to meddle
with, and if they had, would, in all Probability,
have made the better Side the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>There had been &s;everal Seditions of the like Na|ture
in &s;undry other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> and the very
Army began to murmur, though not to mutiny,
for want of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>This Sedition at <HI>Lyons</HI> was not quite over when
we left the Place, for, finding the City all in a
Broil, we con&s;idered we had no Bu&s;ine&s;s there, and
<PB N="18" REF="24">
what the Con&s;equence of a popular Tumult might
be, we did not &s;ee, &s;o we prepared to be gone.
We had not rid above three Miles out of the
City but we were brought as Pri&s;oners of War,
by a Party of Mutineers, who had been abroad
upon the Scout, and were charged with being
Me&s;&s;engers &s;ent to the Cardinal for Forces to
reduce the Citizens: With the&s;e Pretences they
brought us back in Triumph, and the Queen
Mother being by this Time grown &s;omething fa|miliar
to them, they carried us before her.</P>
<P>When they enquired of us who we were, we
called our &s;elves <HI>Scots;</HI> for as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were very
much out of Favour in <HI>France</HI> at this Time, the
Peace having been made not many Months, and
not &s;uppo&s;ed to be very durable, becau&s;e parti|cularly
di&s;plea&s;ing to the People of <HI>England;</HI> &s;o
the <HI>Scots</HI> were on the other Extreme with the
<HI>French.</HI> Nothing was &s;o much care&s;&s;ed as the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and a Man had no more to do in <HI>France,</HI> if
he would be well received there, than to &s;ay he
was a <HI>Scotchman.</HI></P>
<P>When we came before the Queen Mother &s;he
&s;eemed to receive us with &s;ome Stiffne&s;s at fir&s;t,
and cau&s;ed her Guards to take us into Cu&s;tody;
but as &s;he was a Lady of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Politicks,
&s;he did this to amu&s;e the Mob, and we were im|$ediately
after di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and the Queen her &s;elf
made a hand&s;ome Excu&s;e to us for the Rude|ne&s;s
we had &s;uffered, alledging the Troubles of
the Times; and the next Morning we had three
Dragoons of the Guards to convoy us out of the
Juri&s;diction of <HI>Lyons.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s this little Adventure gave me an
Aver&s;ion to popular Tumults all my Life after,
and if nothing el&s;e had been in the Cau&s;e, would
have bya&s;&s;ed me to e&s;pou&s;e the King's Party in
<PB N="19" REF="25">
<HI>England,</HI> when our popular Heats carried all be|fore
it at home.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;ay, that when I called to mind
&s;ince the Addre&s;s, the Management, the Com|pliance
in &s;hew, and in general the whole Con|duct
of the Queen Mother with the mutinous
People of <HI>Lyons,</HI> and compared it with the Con|duct
of my unhappy Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>England,</HI>
I could not but &s;ee that the Queen under&s;tood
much better than King <HI>Charles,</HI> the Management
of Politicks, and the Clamours of the People.</P>
<P>Had this Prince&s;s been at the Helm in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
the would have prevented all the Calami|ties
of the Civil War here, and yet not have
parted with what that good Prince yielded in
order to Peace neither; &s;he would have yield|ed
gradually, and then gained upon them gra|dually;
&s;he would have managed them to the
Point &s;he had de&s;igned them, as &s;he did all Par|ties
in <HI>France;</HI> and none could effectually &s;ubject
her, but the very Man &s;he had rai&s;ed to be her
principal Support; I mean the Cardinal.</P>
<P>We went from hence to <HI>Grenoble,</HI> and arrived
there the &s;ame Day that the King and the Car|dinal,
with the whole Court, went out to view
a Body of 6000 <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Foot, which the Cardinal
had wheedled the Cantons to grant to the King
to help ruin their Neighbour the Duke of
<HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>The Troops were exceeding fine, well accou|tred,
brave, cleail-limbed, &s;tout Fellows indeed.
Here I &s;aw the Cardinal; there was an Air of
Church Gravity in his Habit, but all the Vigor
of a General, and the Sprightline&s;s of a va&s;t
Genius in his Face; he affected a little Stiffne&s;s
in his Behaviour, but managed all his Affairs
with &s;uch Clearne&s;s &s;uch Steddine&s;s, and &s;uch
<PB N="20" REF="26">
Application, that it was no Wonder he had &s;uch
Succe&s;s in every Undertaking.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw the King, who&s;e Figure was mean,
his Countenance hollow, and always &s;eemed
dejected, and every Way di&s;covering that Weak|ne&s;s
in his Countenance that appeared in his
Actions.</P>
<P>If he was ever &s;prightly and vigorous it was
when the Cardinal was with him; for he depended
&s;o much on every Thing he did, that he was
at the utmo&s;t Dilemma when he was ab&s;ent,
always timorous, jealous and irre&s;olute.</P>
<P>After the Review the Cardinal was ab&s;ent
&s;ome Days, having been to wait on the Queen
Mother at <HI>Lyons,</HI> where, as it was di&s;cour&s;ed,
they were at lea&s;t &s;eemingly reconciled.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved while the Cardinal was gone there
was no Court, the King was &s;eldom to be &s;een,
very &s;mall Attendance given, and no Bu&s;tle at
the Ca&s;tle; but as &s;oon as the Cardinal returned
the great Councils were a&s;&s;embled, the Coaches
of the Amba&s;&s;adors went every Day to the
Ca&s;tle, and a Face of Bu&s;ine&s;s appeared upon the
whole Court.</P>
<P>Here the Mea&s;ures of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s
Rune were concerted, and in Order to it the
King and the Cardinal put them&s;elves at the Head
of the Army, with which they immediately
reduced all <HI>Savoy,</HI> took <HI>Chamberry</HI> and the whole
Dutchy except <HI>Montmelian.</HI></P>
<P>The Army that did this was not above 22000
Men, including the <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> and but indifferent
Troops neither, e&s;pecally the <HI>French</HI> Foot, who
compared to the Infantry I have &s;ince &s;een in
the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Swedi&s;h Armies,</HI> were not fit to
be called Soldiers. On the other hand, con&s;i|dering
the <HI>Savoyards</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Troops, they
<PB N="21" REF="27">
were good Troops; but the Cardinal's Conduct
made amends for all the&s;e Deficiencies.</P>
<P>From hence I went to <HI>Pignerol,</HI> which was
then little more than a &s;ingle Fortification on
the Hill near the Town called St. <HI>Bride's;</HI> but
the Situation of that was very &s;trong: I mention
this becau&s;e of the prodigious Works &s;ince added
to it, by which it has &s;ince obtained the Name
of the Right Hand of <HI>France;</HI> they had begun
a New Line below the Hill, and &s;ome Works
were marked out on the Side of the Town next
the Fort; but the Cardinal afterwards drew
the Plan of the Works with his own Hand, by
which it was made one of the &s;tronge&s;t
Fortre&s;&s;es in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Pignerol</HI> the Governor of <HI>Milan</HI>
for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came with an Army and &s;at
down before <HI>Ca&s;al.</HI> The Grand Quarrel and
for which the War in this Part of <HI>Italy</HI> was
begun, was this; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> pre|tended
to the Dutchy of <HI>Mantua;</HI> the Duke of
<HI>Nevers,</HI> a French Man, had not only a Title to it,
but had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, but being ill &s;upported
by the <HI>French,</HI> was beaten out by the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI>
and after a long Siege the <HI>Germans</HI> took <HI>Mantua</HI>
it &s;elf, and drove the poor Duke quite out of
the Country.</P>
<P>The taking of <HI>Mantua</HI> elevated the Spirits of
the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI>
being now at more Lei&s;ure, with a compleat Army
came to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and formed the Siege of
<HI>Montferrat.</HI></P>
<P>For as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pu&s;hed the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI>
&s;o the <HI>French</HI> by Way of Diver&s;ion lay hard upon
the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> they had &s;eized <HI>Montferrat,</HI>
and held it for the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and had a
&s;trong <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;on under <HI>Thoiras,</HI> a brave and
<PB N="22" REF="28">
experienced Commander; and thus Affairs &s;tood
when we came into the <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s there, as a Soldier, but having
pa&s;&s;ed as a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman with the Mob at
<HI>Lyons,</HI> and after with her Maje&s;ty, the Queen
Mother, when we obtained the Guard of her
Dragoons; we had al&s;o her Maje&s;ty's Pa&s;s, with
which we came and went where we plea&s;ed; and
the Cardinal, who was then not on very good
Terms with the Queen, but willing to keep
&s;mooth Water there, when two or three times
our Pa&s;&s;es came to be examined, &s;hewed a more
than ordinary Re&s;pect to us on that very account,
our Pa&s;&s;es being from the Queen.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;al</HI> being be&s;ieged, as I have ob&s;erved, began
to be in Danger, for the Cardinal, who 'twas
thought had formed a De&s;ign to ruin <HI>Savoy,</HI> was
more intent upon that than upon the Succour of
the Duke of <HI>Mantua;</HI> but Nece&s;&s;ity calling
upon him to deliver &s;o great a Captain as <HI>Thoiras,</HI>
and not to let &s;&s;ch a Place as <HI>Ca&s;al</HI> fall into the
Hands of the Enemy, the King, or Cardinal
rather, order'd the Duke of <HI>Momorency</HI> and the
Mare&s;chal D' <HI>Effiat,</HI> with 10000 Foot and 2000
Hor&s;e, to march and joyn the Mare&s;chals <HI>De la
Force</HI> and <HI>Schomberg,</HI> who lay already with an
Army on the Frontiers of <HI>Genoa,</HI> but too weak to
attempt the rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Ca&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>As all Men thought there would be a Battle
between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I could not
prevail with my &s;elf to lo&s;e the Opportunity,
and therefore by the Help of the Pa&s;&s;es abovemen|tioned,
I came to the <HI>French</HI> Army under the Duke
of <HI>Momorency;</HI> we marched through the Enemy's
Country with great Boldne&s;s and no &s;mall
Hazard, for the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> appeared fre|quently
<PB N="23" REF="29">
with great Bodies of Hor&s;e on the
Rear of the Army, and frequently skirmi&s;hed
with our Troops, in one of which I had the
Folly, <HI>I can call it no better, for I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s
there,</HI> to go out and &s;ee the Sport, as the <HI>French</HI>
Gentlemen called it; I was but a raw Soldier,
and did not like the Sport at all, for this Party
was &s;urrounded by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and almo&s;t
all killed, for as to Quarter, they neither asked
nor gave; I run away very fairly one of the
fir&s;t, and my Companion with me, and by the
Goodne&s;s of our Hor&s;es got out of the Fray, and
being not much known in the Army, we came into
the Camp an hour or two after, as if we had
been only riding abroad for the Air.</P>
<P>This little Rout made the General very cauti|ous,
for the <HI>Savoyards</HI> were &s;tronger in Hor&s;e by
3 or 4000, and the Army always marched in a
Body, and kept their Parties in or very near
Hand.</P>
<P>I'&s;caped another Rub in this <HI>French</HI> Army
about five Days after, which had liked to have
made me pay dear for my Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Mormorency</HI> and the Mare&s;chal
<HI>Schomberg</HI> joined their Army above four or five
Days after, and immediately, according to the
Cardinal's In&s;tructions, put them&s;elves on the
March for the Relief of <HI>Ca&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>The Army had marched over a great Plain,
with &s;ome mar&s;hy Grounds on the Right, and
the <HI>Po</HI> on the Left, and as the Country was
&s;o well di&s;covered that 'twas thought impo&s;&s;ible
any Mi&s;chief &s;hould happen, the Generals ob&s;erved
the le&s;s Caution. At the End of this Plain was
a long Wood, and a Lane or narrow Defile thro'
the Middle of it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30">
Thro' this Pa&s;s the Army was to march, and
the Van began to file through it about four a
Clock; by three Hours Time all the Army was
got through, or into the Pa&s;s, and the Artillery
was ju&s;t entred when the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with
4000 Hor&s;e and 1500 Dragoons, with every
Hor&s;e-man a Foot-man behind him; whether he
had &s;wam the <HI>Po,</HI> or pa&s;&s;ed it above at a Bridge,
and made a long March after, was not examined,
but he came boldly up the Plain and charged our
Rear with a great deal of Fury.</P>
<P>Our Artillery was in the Lane, and as it was
impo&s;&s;ible to turn them about, and make way
for the Army, &s;o the Rear was obliged to &s;ap|port
them&s;elves, and maintain the Fight for above
an Hour and a half.</P>
<P>In this Time we lo&s;t abundance of Men, and
if it had not been for two Accidents all that Line
had been cut off; one was, that the Wood was
&s;o near that tho&s;e Regiments which were di&s;|ordered
pre&s;ently &s;heltred them&s;elves in the
Wood; the other was, that by this Time the
Mare&s;chal <HI>Schomberg,</HI> with the Hor&s;e of the Van,
began to get back through the Lane, and to
make good the Ground from whence the other
had been beaten, till at la&s;t by this Means it
came to almo&s;t a pitched Battle.</P>
<P>There were two Regiments of <HI>French</HI> Dragoons
who did excellent Service in this Action, and
maintained their Ground till they were almo&s;t
all killed.</P>
<P>Had the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> contented him&s;elf with
the Defeat of five Regiments on the Right, which
he quite broke and drove into the Wood, and
with the Slaughter and Havock which he had
made among the re&s;t, he had come off with
Honour, and might have called it a Victory;
<PB N="25" REF="31">
but endeavouring to break the whole Party,
and carry off &s;ome Cannon, the ob&s;tinate Re&s;i|&s;tance
of the&s;e few Dragoons lo&s;t him his Advan|tages,
and held him in play till &s;o many fre&s;h
Troops got through the Pa&s;s again, as made us
too &s;trong for him; and had not Night parted
them he had been entirely defeated.</P>
<P>At la&s;t finding our Troops encrea&s;e and &s;pread
them&s;elves on his Flank, he retired and gave over,
we had no great Stomach to pur&s;ue him neither,
tho' &s;ome Hor&s;e were ordered to follow a little
Way.</P>
<P>The Duke lo&s;t above a thou&s;and Men, and we
almo&s;t twice as many, and but for tho&s;e Dragoons,
had lo&s;t the whole Rear-guard and half our Can|non.
I was in a very &s;orry Ca&s;e in this Action
too, I was with the Rear in the Regiment of
Hor&s;e of <HI>Perigoort,</HI> with a Captain of which Re|giment
I had contracted &s;ome Acquaintance; I
would have rid off at fir&s;t, as the Captain de|&s;ired
me, but there was no doing it, for the
Cannon was in the Lane, and the Hor&s;e and
Dragoons of the Van eagerly pre&s;&s;ing back
through the Lane, mu&s;t have run me down,
or carried me with them: As for the Wood,
it was a good Shelter to &s;ave ones Life, but was
&s;o thick there was no pa&s;&s;ing it on Hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Our Regiment was one of the fir&s;t that was
broke, and being all in Confu&s;ion, with the Duke
of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Men at our Heels, away we ran into the
Wood; never was there &s;o much Di&s;order among
a Parcel of Runaways as when we came to this
Wood, it was &s;o exceeding bu&s;hy and thick at
the Bottom there was no entring it, and a Volley
of &s;mall Shot from a Regiment of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Dra|goons
poured in upon us at our breaking into the
Wood made terrible Work among our Hor&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="32">
For my Part I was got into the Wood, but
was forced to quit my Hor&s;e, and by that means
with a great deal of Difficulty got a little farther
in, where there was a little open Place, and being
quite &s;pent with labouring among the Bu&s;hes, I
&s;at down re&s;olving to take my Fate there, let it
be what it would, for I was not able to go any
farther; I had twenty or thirty more in the
&s;ame Condition came to me in le&s;s than half an
Hour, and here we waited very &s;ecurely the
Succe&s;s of the Battle, which was as before.</P>
<P>It was no &s;mall Relief to tho&s;e with me to
hear the <HI>Savoyards</HI> were beaten, for otherwi&s;e
they had all been lo&s;t; as for me, I confe&s;s, I
was glad as it was, becau&s;e of the Danger, but
otherwi&s;e I cared not much which had the bet|ter,
for I de&s;igned no Service among them.</P>
<P>One Kindne&s;s it did me, that I began to con&s;i|der
what I had to do here, and as I could give but
a very &s;lender Account of my &s;elf for what it was
I run all the&s;e Ri&s;ques, &s;o I re&s;olved they
&s;hould fight it out among them&s;elves, for I would
come among them no more.</P>
<P>The Captain with whom, as I noted above, I
had contracted &s;ome Acquaintance in this Regi|ment,
was killed in this Action, and the <HI>French</HI> had
really a great Blow here, though they took Care
to conceal it all they could; and I cannot, with|out
&s;miling, read &s;ome of the Hi&s;tories and
Memoirs of this Action, which they are not
a&s;hamed to call a Victory.</P>
<P>We marched on to <HI>Saluces,</HI> and the next Day
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf in Batallia
on the other Side of a &s;mall River giving us
a fair Challenge to pa&s;s and engage him: We
always &s;aid in our Camp that the Orders were to
<PB N="27" REF="33">
fight the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> where-ever we met him;
but tho' he braved us in our View, we did not
care to engage him, but we brought <HI>Saluces</HI> to
&s;urrender upon Articles, which the Duke could
not relieve without attacking our Camp, which
he did not care to do.</P>
<P>The next Morning we had News of the Sur|render
of <HI>Mantua</HI> to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army; we heard
of it fir&s;t from the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Cannon, which
he fired by way of Rejoycing, and which &s;eemed
to make him Amends for the lo&s;s of <HI>Saluces.</HI></P>
<P>As this was a Mortification to the <HI>French,</HI> &s;o
it quite damped the Succe&s;s of the Campaign,
for the Duke <HI>de Momorency</HI> imagining that the
<HI>Imperial</HI> General would &s;end immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance
to the Marquis <HI>Spinola,</HI> who be&s;ieged <HI>Ca&s;al,</HI> they
call'd frequent Councils of War what Cour&s;e to
take, and at la&s;t re&s;olved to halt in <HI>Piedmont.</HI></P>
<P>A few Days after their Re&s;olutions were
changed again, by the News of the Death of
the Duke of <HI>Savoy, Charles Emanuel,</HI> who died, as
&s;ome &s;ay, agitated with the Extreams of Joy and
Grief.</P>
<P>This put our Generals upon con&s;idering again,
whether they &s;hould march to the Relief of
<HI>Ca&s;al,</HI> but the Chimera of the <HI>Germans</HI> put them
by, and &s;o they took up Quarters in <HI>Piedmont;</HI>
they took &s;everal &s;mall Places from the Duke
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> making Advantage of the Con&s;ternation
the Duke's Subjects were in on the Death of their
Prince, and &s;pread them&s;elves from the Sea-&s;ide
to the Banks of the <HI>Po.</HI></P>
<P>But here an Enemy did that for them which
the <HI>Savoyards</HI> could not, for the Plague got into
their Quarters and de&s;troyed abundance of Peo|ple,
both of the Army and of the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34">
I thought then it was Time for me to be
gone, for I had no manner of Courage for that
Ri&s;que; and I think verily I was more afraid
of being taken &s;ick in a &s;trange Country, than
ever I was of being killed in Battle. Upon this
Re&s;olution I procured a Pa&s;s to go for <HI>Genoa,</HI> and
acordingly began my Journey, but was arre&s;ted at
<HI>Villa Franca</HI> by a &s;low lingring Fever, which held
me about five Days, and then turned to a burn|ing
Malignancy, and at la&s;t to the Plague: My
Friend, the Captain, never left me Night nor
Day; and though for four Days more I knew
no Body, nor was capable of &s;o much as think|ing
of my &s;elf, yet it plea&s;ed God that the Di|&s;temper
gathered in my Neck, &s;welled and broke;
during the Swelling I was raging mad with the
Violence of Pain, which being &s;o near my Head,
&s;welled that al&s;o in Proportion, that my Eyes
were &s;welled up, and for twenty four Hours my
Tongue and Mouth; then, as my Servant told
me, all the Phy&s;icians gave me over, as pa&s;t all
Remedy, but by the good Providence of God
the Swelling broke.</P>
<P>The prodigious Collection of Matter which
this Swelling di&s;charged, gave me immediate Re|lief,
and I became &s;en&s;ible in le&s;s than an Hour's
Time; and in two Hours, or thereabouts, fell
into a little Slumber which recovered my Spi|rits,
and &s;en&s;ibly revived me. Here I lay by it
till the Middle of <HI>September,</HI> my Captain fell &s;ick
after me, but recovered quickly; his Man had
the Plague, and died in two Days; my Man
held it out well.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>September</HI> we heard of a
Truce concluded between all Parties, and being
unwilling to winter at <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> I got Pa&s;&s;es,
<PB N="29" REF="35">
and though we were both but weak began to
travel in Litters for <HI>Milan.</HI></P>
<P>And here I experienced the Truth of an old
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb, <HI>That Standers-by &s;ee more than the
Game&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French, Savoyards</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> made this
Peace or Truce all for &s;eparate and &s;everal
Grounds, and every one were mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> yielded to it becau&s;e they had given
over the Relief of <HI>Ca&s;al,</HI> and were very much
afraid it would fall into the Hands of the Mar|qui&s;s
<HI>Spinola.</HI> The <HI>Savoyards</HI> yielded to it be|cau&s;e
they were afraid the <HI>French</HI> would winter
in <HI>Piedmont;</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> yielded to it becau&s;e the
Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> being dead, and the Count <HI>de Co|lalto,</HI>
the <HI>Imperial</HI> General, giving no A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and his Army weakened by Sickne&s;s and the Fa|tigues
of the Siege, he fore&s;aw he &s;hould never
take the Town, and wanted but to come off
with Honour.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> were mi&s;taken, becau&s;e really <HI>Spi|nola</HI>
was &s;o weak, that had they marched on into
<HI>Montferrat</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> mu&s;t have rai&s;ed the Siege;
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was mi&s;taken, becau&s;e the
Plague had &s;o weakened the <HI>French</HI> that they
dur&s;t not have &s;taid to winter in <HI>Piedmont;</HI> and
<HI>Spinola</HI> was mi&s;taken, for tho' he was very &s;low,
if he had &s;taid before the Town one Fortnight
longer <HI>Thoiras</HI> the Governour mu&s;t have &s;ur|rendred,
being brought to the la&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e Mi&s;takes the <HI>French</HI> had the Ad|vantage,
for <HI>Ca&s;al</HI> was relieved, the Army had
Time to be recruited, and the <HI>French</HI> had the be&s;t
of it by an early Campaign.</P>
<P>I pa&s;t through <HI>Montferrat</HI> in my Way to
<HI>Milan</HI> ju&s;t as the Truce was declared, and &s;aw
the mi&s;erable Remains of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army, who
<PB N="30" REF="36">
by Sickne&s;s, Fatigue, hard Duty, the Sallies of
the Garri&s;on, and &s;uch like Con&s;equences, were
reduced to le&s;s than 2000 Men, and of them
above 1000 lay wounded and &s;ick in the
Camp.</P>
<P>Here were &s;everal Reigments which I &s;aw
drawn out to their Arms that could not make
up above 70 or 80 Men, Officers and all, and
tho&s;e half &s;tarved with Hunger, almo&s;t naked,
and in a lamentable Condition. From thence I
went into the Town, and there Things were
&s;till in a wor&s;e Condition, the Hou&s;es beaten
down, the Walls and Works ruined, the Gar|ri&s;on,
by continual Duty, reduced from 4500
Men to le&s;s than 800, without Clothes, Money, or
Provi&s;ions. The brave Governour weak with
continual Fatigue, and the whole Face of things
in a mi&s;erable Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Generals had ju&s;t &s;ent them Thir|ty
Thou&s;and Crowns for pre&s;ent Supply, which
heartened them a little, but had not the Truce
been made as it was, they mu&s;t have &s;urrendred
upon what Terms the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had plea&s;ed to
make them.</P>
<P>Never were two Armies in &s;uch Fear of one
another with &s;o little Cau&s;e; the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
afraid of the <HI>French</HI> whom the Plague had de|voured,
and the <HI>French</HI> afraid of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
whom the Siege had almo&s;t ruined.</P>
<P>The Grief of this Mi&s;take, together with the
Sen&s;e of his Ma&s;ter, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> leaving him
without Supplies to compleat the Siege of
<HI>Ca&s;al,</HI> &s;o affected the Marque&s;s <HI>Spinola</HI> that
he died for Grief, and in him fell the la&s;t of
that rare breed of <HI>Low Country</HI> Soldiers who
gave the World &s;o great and ju&s;t a Character
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Infantry as the be&s;t Soldiers of the
<PB N="31" REF="37">
World; a Character which we &s;ee them &s;o very
much degenerated from &s;ince, that they hardly
de&s;erve the Name of Soldiers.</P>
<P>I tarried at <HI>Milan</HI> the re&s;t of the Winter, both
for the Recovery of my Health, and al&s;o for
Supplies from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here it was I fir&s;t heard the Name of <HI>Gu&s;ta|vus
Adolphus,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who now be|gan
his War with the Emperor; and while the
King of <HI>France</HI> was at <HI>Lyons,</HI> the League with
<HI>Sweden</HI> was made, in which the <HI>French</HI> contributed
1200000 Crowns in Money, and 600000 <HI>per An.</HI>
to the Attempt of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus:</HI> About this
Time he landed in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> took the Towns of
<HI>Stetin</HI> and <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> and from thence proceeded
in that prodigious Manner, of which I &s;hall have
Occa&s;ion to be very particular in the Pro&s;ecu|tion
of the&s;e Memoirs.</P>
<P>I had indeed no Thoughts of &s;eeing that King,
or his Armies, I had been &s;o roughly handled
already that I had given over the Thoughts of
appearing among the fighting People, and re&s;ol|ved
in the Spring to pur&s;ue my Journey to <HI>Ve|nice,</HI>
and &s;o for the re&s;t of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I cannot deny, that as every Gazette gave
us &s;ome Accounts of the Conque&s;ts and Victo|ries
of this glorious Prince, it prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my
Thoughts with &s;ecret Wi&s;hes of &s;eeing him, but
the&s;e were &s;o young and un&s;ettled, that I drew no
Re&s;olutions from them for a long while after.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>January</HI> I left <HI>Milan</HI> and
came to <HI>Genoa,</HI> from thence by Sea to <HI>Leghorn,</HI>
then to <HI>Naples, Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> but &s;aw nothing
in <HI>Italy</HI> that gave me any Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>As for what is modern, I &s;aw nothing but
Lewdne&s;s, private Murthers, &s;tabbing Men at the
Corner of a Street, or in the dark, hiring of
<PB N="32" REF="38">
Bravoes, and the like; all the Diver&s;ions here
ended in Whoring, Gaming and Sodomy, the&s;e
were to me the modern Excellencies of <HI>Italy;</HI>
and I had no Gu&s;t to Antiquities.</P>
<P>'Twas plea&s;ant indeed when I was at <HI>Rome</HI> to
&s;ay here &s;tood the Capitol, there the Colo&s;&s;us of
<HI>Nero,</HI> here was the Amphitheatre of <HI>Titus,</HI> there
the Aqueduct of&mdash;here the Forum, there the
Catacombs, here the Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> there of
<HI>Jupiter,</HI> here the Pantheon, and the like; but I
never de&s;igned to write a Book, as much as was
u&s;eful I kept in my Head; and for the re&s;t, I
left it to others.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved the People degenerated from the an|cient
glorious Inhabitants, who were generous,
brave, and the mo&s;t valiant of all Nations, to a
vicious Ba&s;ene&s;s of Soul, barbarous, treacherous,
jealous and revengeful, lewd and cowardly, in|tolerably
proud and haughty, bigotted to blind,
incoherent Devotion, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of Idolatry.</P>
<P>Indeed I think the Un&s;uitablene&s;s of the Peo|ple
made the Place unplea&s;ant to me, for there
is &s;o little in a Country to recommend it when
the People di&s;grace it, that no Beauties of the
Creation can make up for the Want of tho&s;e
Excellencies which &s;uitable Society procure the
Defect of; this made <HI>Italy</HI> a very unplea&s;ant
Country to me, the People were the Foil to the
Place, all manner of hateful Vices reigning in
their general Way of living.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was not very religious my &s;elf, and
being come abroad into the World young enough,
might ea&s;ily have been drawn into Evils that
had recommended them&s;elves with any tolerable
Agreeablene&s;s to Nature and common Manners;
but when Wickedne&s;s pre&s;ented it &s;elf full grown
in its gro&s;&s;e&s;t Freedoms and Liberties, it quite took
<PB N="33" REF="39">
away all the Gu&s;t to Vice that the Devil had
furni&s;hed me with, and in this I cannot but relate
one Scene which pa&s;&s;ed between no Body but
the Devil and my &s;elf.</P>
<P>At a certain Town in <HI>Italy,</HI> which &s;hall be
namele&s;s, becau&s;e I won't celebrate the Proficiency
of one Place more than another, when I believe
the whole Country equally wicked, I was pre|vailed
upon rather than tempted, <HI>a la Courtezan.</HI></P>
<P>If I &s;hould de&s;cribe the Woman I mu&s;t give
a very mean Character of my own Virtue to &s;ay
I was allured by any but a Woman of an ex|traordinary
Figure; her Face, Shape, Mein, and
Dre&s;s, I may, without Vanity, &s;ay, the fine&s;t that
I ever &s;aw: When I had Admittance into her
Apartments, the Riches and Magnificence of them
a&s;toni&s;hed me, the Cupboard or Cabinet of Plate,
the Jewels, the Cape&s;try, and every Thing in
Proportion, made me que&s;tion whether I was not
in the Chamber of &s;ome Lady of the be&s;t Quality;
&mdash;but when after &s;ome Conver&s;ation I found
that it was really nothing but a Courtezan, in
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a common Street Whore, a Punk of the
Trade, I was amazed, and my Inclination to her
Per&s;on began to cool; her Conver&s;ation exceed|ed
if po&s;&s;ible, the be&s;t of Quality, and was, I
mu&s;t own, exceeding agreeable; &s;he &s;ung to her
Lute, and danced as fine as ever I &s;aw, and thus
diverted me two Hours before any Thing el&s;e
was di&s;cour&s;ed of;&mdash;but when the vicious Part
came on the Stage, I blu&s;h to relate the Con|fu&s;ion
I was in, and when &s;he made a certain
Motion by which I under&s;tood &s;he might be
made u&s;e of, either as a Lady, or as&mdash;I was
quite Thunder-&s;truck, all the vicious Part of my
Thoughts vani&s;hed, the Place filled me with Hor|ror,
and I was all over Di&s;order and Di&s;traction.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="40">
I began however to recollect where I was, and
that in this Country the&s;e were People not to
be affronted; and though &s;he ea&s;ily &s;aw the Di&s;|order
I was in, &s;he turned it off with ad|mirable
Dexterity, began to talk again <HI>a la Gal|lant,</HI>
received me as a Vi&s;itant, offered me Sweet|meats
and &s;ome Wine.</P>
<P>Here I began to be in more Confu&s;ion than
before, for I concluded &s;he would neither offer
me to eat or to drink now <HI>without Poi&s;on,</HI> and I
was very &s;hy of ta&s;ting her Treat, but &s;he &s;cat|tered
this Fear immediately, by readily, and of
her own accord, not only ta&s;ting but eating free|ly
of every Thing &s;he gave me; whether &s;he per|ceived
my Warine&s;s, or the Rea&s;on of it, I know
not, I could not help bani&s;hing my Su&s;picion,
the obliging Carriage and &s;trange Charm of her
Conver&s;ation had &s;o much Power of me, that
I both eat and drank with her at all Hazards.</P>
<P>When I offered to go, and at parting pre&s;ent|ed
her five Pi&s;toles, I could not prevail with
her to take them, when &s;he &s;poke &s;ome <HI>Italian</HI>
Proverb which I could not readily under&s;tand,
but by my Gue&s;s it &s;eemed to imply, that <HI>&s;he would
not take the Pay, having not obliged me otherwi&s;e:</HI> At
la&s;t I laid the Pieces on her Toilet, and would
not receive them again; upon which &s;he obliged
me to pa&s;s ray Word to vi&s;it her again, el&s;e &s;he
would by no Means accept my Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I had a &s;trong Inclination to vi&s;it her
again, and be&s;ides thought my &s;elf obliged to
it in Honour to my Parole; but after &s;ome Strife
in my Thoughts about it, I re&s;olved to break my
Word with her, when going at Ve&s;pers one
Evening to &s;ee their Devotions, I happened to
meet this very Lady very devoutly going to her
Prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41">
At her coming out of the Church I &s;poke to
her, &s;he paid me her Re&s;pects with a <HI>Seignior Ingle&s;e,</HI>
and &s;ome Words &s;he &s;aid in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;miling, which
I did not under&s;tand; I cannot &s;ay here &s;o clear|ly
as I would be glad I might, that I broke my
Word with her; but if I &s;aw her any more I
&s;aw nothing of what gave me &s;o much Offence
before.</P>
<P>The End of my relating this Story is an&s;wer|ed
in de&s;cribing the Manner of their Addre&s;s,
without bringing my felf to Confe&s;&s;ion; if I
did any Thing I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed
of, it may be a le&s;s Crime to conceal it than ex|po&s;e
it.</P>
<P>The Particulars related however, may lead the
Reader of the&s;e Sheets to a View of what gave
me a particular Di&s;gu&s;t at this plea&s;ant Part of
the World, as they pretend to call it, and made
me quit the Place &s;ooner than Travellers u&s;e
to do that come thither to &s;atisfy their Cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The prodigious &s;tupid Bigottry of the People
al&s;o was irk&s;ome to me; I thought there was
&s;omething in it very &s;ordid, the entire Empire
the Prie&s;ts have over both the Souls and Bodies
of the People, gave me a Specimen of that Mean|ne&s;s
of Spirit which is no where el&s;e to be &s;een
but in <HI>Italy,</HI> e&s;pecially in the City of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Venice</HI> I perceived it quite different, the
Civil Authority having a vi&s;ible Superiority over
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick; and the Church being more
&s;ubject there to the State than in any other Part
of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons I took no Plea&s;ure in fil|ling
my Memoirs of <HI>Italy</HI> with Remarks of Places
or Things, all the Antiquities and valuable Re|mains
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Nation are done better than
<PB N="36" REF="42">
I can pretend to by &s;uch People who made it
more their Bu&s;ine&s;s; as for me, I went to &s;ee, and
not to write, and as little thought then of the&s;e
Memoirs, as I ill furni&s;hed my &s;elf to write them.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Italy</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> and taking the Tour of
<HI>Bavaria,</HI> though very much out of the Way, I
pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Munick, Pa&s;&s;aw, Lints,</HI> and at la&s;t
to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>I came to <HI>Vienna</HI> the 10th of <HI>April</HI> 1631, in|tending
to have gone from thence down the <HI>Da|nube</HI>
into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and by Means of a Pa&s;s which
I had obtained from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at
<HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I de&s;igned to have &s;een all tho&s;e
great Towns on the <HI>Danube</HI> which were then in
the Hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and which I had read much
of in the Hi&s;tory of the War between the <HI>Turks</HI>
and the <HI>Germans;</HI> but I was diverted from my
De&s;ign by the following Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There had been a long bloody War in the
Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> for 12 Years, between the
Emperor, the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> and the Popi&s;h Princes and Electors on
the one Side, and the Prote&s;tant Princes on the
other; and both Sides having been exhau&s;ted
by the War, and even the Catholicks them&s;elves
beginning to di&s;like the growing Power of the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> 'twas thought all Parties were
willing to make Peace.</P>
<P>Nay, Things were brought to that Pa&s;s that
&s;ome of the Popi&s;h Princes and Electors began
to talk of making Alliances with the King of
<HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the two
Dukes of <HI>Mecklenburgh</HI> having been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of mo&s;t of their Dominions by the Tyranny of
the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and being in danger of
lo&s;ing the re&s;t, earne&s;tly &s;ollicited the King of
<PB N="37" REF="43">
<HI>Sweden</HI> to come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that Prince,
as he was related to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mecklen|burgh,</HI>
and e&s;pecially as he was willing to lay
hold of any Opportunity to break with the Em|peror,
again&s;t whom he had laid up an impla|cable
Prejudice, was very ready and forward to
come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons of his Quarrel with the Empe|ror
were grounded upon the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> concern|ing
them&s;elves in the War of <HI>Poland,</HI> where the
Emperor had &s;ent 8000 Foot and 2000 Hor&s;e
to join the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army again&s;t the King, and
had thereby given &s;ome Check to his Arms in
that War.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance therefore of his Re&s;olution to
quarrel with the Emperor, but more particu|larly
at the In&s;tance of the Princes above-named,
his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had landed the Year before
at <HI>Strael&s;und</HI> with about 12000 Men, and having
joined with &s;ome Forces which he had left in <HI>Po|li&s;h
Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> all which did not make 30000 Men,
he began a War with the Emperor, the great|e&s;t
in Event, filled with the mo&s;t famous Bat|tels,
Sieges and extraordinary Actions, including
its wonderful Succe&s;s and happy Conclu&s;ion, of
any War ever maintained in the World.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had already taken <HI>Stetin, Strael|&s;und,
Ro&s;tock, Wi&s;mar,</HI> and all the &s;trong Places on
the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and began to &s;pread him&s;elf in <HI>Germa|ny;</HI>
he had made a League with the <HI>French,</HI> as
I ob&s;erved in my Story of <HI>Saxony,</HI> he had now
made a Treaty with the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and,
in &s;hort, began to be terrible to the Empire.</P>
<P>In this Conjuncture the Emperor called the
General Diet of the Empire to be held at <HI>Ra|tisbon,</HI>
where, as was pretended, all Sides were
to treat of Peace and to join Forces to beat the
<PB N="38" REF="44">
<HI>Swedes</HI> out of the Empire. Here the Emperor, by
a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Management, brought the
Affairs of the Diet to a Conclu&s;ion, exceedingly
to his own Advantage and to the farther Op|pre&s;&s;ion
of the Prote&s;tants; and in particular, in
that the War again&s;t the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was to
be carried on in &s;uch Manner as that the whole
Burthen and Charge would lie on the Prote&s;tants
them&s;elves, and they be made the In&s;truments
to oppo&s;e their be&s;t Friends. Other Matters
al&s;o ended equally to their Di&s;advantage, as the
Methods re&s;olved on to recover the Church-Lands,
and ro prevent the Education of the Pro|te&s;tant
Clergy; and what remained was referred
to another General Diet to be held at <HI>Frankfort
au Main,</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1631.</P>
<P>I won't pretend to &s;ay the other Prote&s;tant
Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> had never made any Overtures
to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
but 'tis plain they had entred into no League
with him; that appears from the Difficulties
which retarded the fixing the Treaties after|ward,
both with the Dukes of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and
<HI>Saxony</HI> which unhappily occa&s;ioned the Ruine
of <HI>Magdenburgh.</HI></P>
<P>But 'tis Plain the <HI>Swede</HI> was re&s;olved on a War
with the Emperor; his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty might and
indeed could not but fore&s;ee that if he once
&s;hewed him&s;elf with a &s;ufficient Force on the
Frontiers of the Empire, all the Prote&s;tant
Princes would be obliged by their Intere&s;t or by
his Arms to fall in with him, and this the Con&s;e|quence
made appear to be a ju&s;t Conclu&s;ion; for
the Electors of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Saxony</HI> were both
forced to join with him.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They were willing to join with him,
at lea&s;t they could not find in their Hearts to
<PB N="39" REF="45">
join with the Emperor, of who&s;e Power they
had &s;uch ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions; they wi&s;hed the
<HI>Swedes</HI> Succe&s;s, and would have been very glad
to have had the Work done at another Man's
Charge; but like true <HI>Germans</HI> they were more wil|ling
to be &s;aved than to &s;ave them&s;elves, and there|fore
hung back and &s;tood upon Terms.</P>
<P>Secondly, They were at la&s;t forced to it; the
fir&s;t was forced to join by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> him|&s;elf,
who being come &s;o far was not to be dallied
with; and had not the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> com|plied
as he did, he had been ruined by the <HI>Swede;</HI>
the <HI>Saxon</HI> was driven into the Arms of the
<HI>Swede</HI> by Force, for Count <HI>Tilly</HI> Ravaging his
Country made him comply with any Terms to
be &s;aved from De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Thus Matters &s;tood at the End of the Diet at
<HI>Ratisbon;</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> began to &s;ee him&s;elf
leagued again&s;t at the Diet both by Prote&s;tant
and Papi&s;t; and, as <HI>I have often heard his Maie&s;ty &s;ay
&s;ince,</HI> he had re&s;olved to try to force them off
from the Emperor, and to treat them as Enemies
equally with the Re&s;t if they did not.</P>
<P>But the Prote&s;tants convinced him &s;oon after,
that tho' they were tricked into the outward Ap|pearance
of a League again&s;t him at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> they
had no &s;uch Intentions; and by their Amba&s;&s;adors
to him let him know, that they only wanted his
powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance to defend their Councils,
when they would &s;oon convince him that they
had a due Sen&s;e of the Emperor's De&s;igns, and
would do their utmo&s;t for their Liberty; and
the&s;e I take to be the fir&s;t Invitations the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had to undertake the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e
as &s;uch, and which entitled him to &s;ay he fought
for the Liberty and Religion of the <HI>German</HI>
Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="46">
I have had &s;ome particular Opportunities to hear
the&s;e Things from the Mouths of &s;ome of the
very Princes them&s;elves, and therefore am the
forwarder to relate them; and I place them here,
becau&s;e previous to the part I acted on this
bloody Scene, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to let the Reader
into &s;ome Part of the Story, and to &s;hew him in
what Manner and on what Occa&s;ions this terrible
War began.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants, alarmed at the U&s;age they
had met with at the former Diet, had &s;ecretly
propo&s;ed among them&s;elves to form a general
Union or Confederacy, for preventing that Ruin
which they &s;aw, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy Remedies
were applied, would be inevitable. The Elector
of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Head of the Prote&s;tants, a vigo|rous
and politick Prince, was the fir&s;t that
moved it; and the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> a zea|lous
and gallant Prince, being con&s;ulted with,
it re&s;ted a great while between tho&s;e two, no
Method being found practicable to bring it to
pa&s;s; the Emperor being &s;o powerful in all
Parts, that they fore&s;aw the petty Princes would
not dare to negotiate an Affair of &s;uch a Nature,
being &s;urrounded with the <HI>Imperial</HI> Forces, who
by their two Generals, <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> and <HI>Tilly,</HI> kept
them in continual Subjection and Terror.</P>
<P>This Dilemma had like to have &s;tifled the
Thoughts of the Union as a Thing impracticable,
when one <HI>Seigenfius,</HI> a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Minister, a Per&s;on
of great Abilities, and one whom the Elector
of <HI>Saxony</HI> made great U&s;e of in Matters of Po|licy
as well as Religion, contrived for them this
excellent Expedient.</P>
<P><HI>I had the Honour to be acquainted with this
Gentleman while I was at</HI> Leip&s;ick; <HI>it plea&s;ed
him exceedingly to have been the Contriver
<PB N="41" REF="47">
of &s;o fine a Structure as the</HI> Conclusions of Leip|&s;ick,
<HI>and he was glad to be entertained on that
Subject; I had the Relation from his own Mouth,
when, but very mode&s;tly, he told me he thought
'twas an In&s;piration darted on a &s;udden into his
Thoughts, when the Duke of</HI> Saxony <HI>calling him in|to
his Clo&s;et one Morning, with a Face full of Con|cern,
&s;haking his Head and looking very earne&s;tly,</HI>
What will become of us, Doctor? <HI>&s;aid the Duke,</HI> we
&s;hall all be undone at <HI>Frankfort au Main.</HI> Why &s;o,
plea&s;e your Highne&s;s? <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> Why they
will fight with the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with our Armies
and our Money, <HI>&s;ays the Duke,</HI> and devour our
Friends and our &s;elves, by the help of our Friends and
our &s;elves: But what is become of the Confederacy then,
<HI>&s;aid the Doctor,</HI> which your Highne&s;s had &s;o happily
framed in your Thoughts, and which the Landgrave of
<HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> was &s;o plea&s;ed with? Become of it, <HI>&s;ays the
Duke,</HI> 'tis a good Thought enough but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
to bring it to pa&s;s among &s;o many Members of the
Prote&s;tant Princes as are to be con&s;ulted with, for we
neither have Time to treat, nor will half of them dare
to negotiate the Matter, the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> being quar|ter'd
in their very Bowels. But may not &s;ome Expedient
be found out, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> to bring them all to|gether
to treat of it in a General Meeting? 'Tis well
propo&s;ed, <HI>&s;ays the Duke,</HI> but in what Town or City
&s;hall they a&s;&s;emble where the very Deputies &s;hall not be
be&s;ieged by <HI>Tilly</HI> or <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> in 14 Days Time, and
&s;acrificed to the Cruelty and Fury of the Emperor <HI>Ferdi|nand?</HI>
Will your Highne&s;s be the ea&s;ier in it, replies
the Doctor, if a way may be found out to call &s;uch an
A&s;&s;embly upon other Cau&s;es, at which the Emperor may
have no &V;mbrage, and perhaps give his A&s;&s;ent? You know
the Diet at <HI>Frankfort</HI> is at Hand; 'tis nece&s;&s;ary the
Prote&s;tants &s;hould have an A&s;&s;embly of their own, to
prepare Matters for the General Diet, and it may be
<PB N="42" REF="48">
no <HI>Difficult</HI> Matter to obtain it. <HI>The Duke, &s;urpri|zed
with Joy at the Motion, embraced the Do|ctor
with an extraordinary Tran&s;port,</HI> Thou ha&s;t
done it, Doctor, <HI>&s;aid he, and immediately cau&s;ed
him to draw a Form of a Letter to the Empe|ror,
which he did with the utmo&s;t Dexterity
of Style, in which he was a great Ma&s;ter, re|pre&s;enting
to his</HI> Imperial <HI>Maje&s;ty, that in or|der
to put an End to the Troubles of</HI> Germany,
<HI>his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to permit the Pro|te&s;tant
Princes of the Empire to hold a Diet to
them&s;elves, to con&s;ider of &s;uch Matters as they
were to treat of at the General Diet, in order to
conform them&s;elves to the Will and Plea&s;ure
of his</HI> Imperial. <HI>Maje&s;ty, to drive out Foreigners,
and &s;ettle a la&s;ting Peace in the Empire; he al&s;o
in&s;inuated &s;omething of their Re&s;olutions unani|mou&s;ly
to give their Suffrages in favour of the
King of</HI> Hungary <HI>at the Election of a King of
the</HI> Romans, <HI>a thing which he knew the Emperor
had in his Thought, and would pu&s;h at with all
his Might at the Diet. This Letter was &s;ent,
and the Bait &s;o neatly concealed, that the Electors
of</HI> Bavaria <HI>and</HI> Mentz, <HI>the King of</HI> Hungary, <HI>and
&s;everal of the Popi&s;h Princes, not fore&s;eeing that
the Ruin of them all lay in the bottom of it,
fooli&s;hly advi&s;ed the Emperor to con&s;ent to it.</HI></P>
<P>In con&s;enting to this the Emperor &s;igned his
own De&s;truction, for here began the Conjunction
of the <HI>German</HI> Prote&s;tants with the <HI>Swede,</HI> which
was the fatale&s;t blow to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and which he
could never recover.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Diet was held at <HI>Leip&s;ick, Feb.</HI>
8, 1630, where the Prote&s;tants agreed on &s;everal
Heads for their mutual Defence, which were
the Grounds of the following War; the&s;e were
<HI>the Famous Conclu&s;ions of Leip&s;ick,</HI> which &s;o alarmed
<PB N="43" REF="49">
the Emperor and the whole Empire, that to
cru&s;h it in the Beginning, the Emperor commanded
Count <HI>Tilly</HI> immediately to fall upon the Landgrave
of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> as the principal
Heads of the Union; but it was too late.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ions were dige&s;ted into ten Heads;</P>
<P>1. That &s;ince their Sins had brought God's
Judgments upon the whole Prote&s;tant Church,
they should command Publick Prayers to be made
to Almighty God for the diverting the Calami|ties
that attended them.</P>
<P>2. That a Treaty of Peace might be &s;et on
Foot, in order to come to a right Under&s;tanding
with the Catholick Princes.</P>
<P>3. That a Time for &s;uch a Treaty being ob|tained,
they should appoint an A&s;&s;embly of De|legates
to meet preparatory to the Treaty.</P>
<P>4. That all their Complaints &s;hould be humbly
repre&s;ented to his <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty, and the Ca|tholick
Electors, in order to a peaceable Accom|modation.</P>
<P>5. That they claim the Protection of the Em|peror,
according to the Laws of the Empire,
and the pre&s;ent Emperor's &s;olemn Oath and
Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>6. That they would appoint Deputies who
&s;hould meet at certain Times to con&s;ullt of their
common Intere&s;t, and who &s;hould be always em|poured
to conclude of what &s;hould be thought
needful for their Safety.</P>
<P>7. That they will rai&s;e a competent Force
to maintain and defend their Liberties, Rights and
Religion.</P>
<P>8. That it is agreeable to the Con&s;titution of
the Empire, concluded in the Diet at <HI>Ausburg</HI> to
do &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50">
9. That the arming for their nece&s;&s;ary De|fence
&s;hall by no Means hinder their Obedience
to his <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty, but that they will &s;till
continue their Loyalty to him.</P>
<P>10. They agree to Proportion their Forces,
which in all amounted to 70000 Men.</P>
<P>The Emperor, exceedingly &s;tartled at the
Conclu&s;ions, i&s;&s;ued out a &s;evere Proclamation or
Ban again&s;t them, which imported much the
&s;ame Thing as a Declaration of War, and com|manded
<HI>Tilly</HI> to begin, and immediately to fall on
the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> with all the Fury imaginable,
as I have already ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Here began the Flame to break out for upon
the Emperor's Ban, the Prote&s;tants &s;end away to
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> for Succour.</P>
<P>His <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had already conquered
<HI>Macklenburgh,</HI> and Part of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and was ad|vancing
with his victorious Troops, encrea&s;ed by
the Addition of &s;ome Regiments rai&s;ed in tho&s;e
Parts, in order to carry on the War again&s;t the
Emperor, having de&s;igned to follow up the <HI>Oder</HI>
into <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and &s;o to pu&s;h the War home to
the Emperor's Hereditary Countries of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI>
and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> when the fir&s;t Me&s;&s;engers came to
him in this Ca&s;e; but this changed his Mea&s;ures,
and brought him to the Frontiers of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI>
re&s;olved to an&s;wer the De&s;ires of the Prote&s;tants:
But here the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> began to halt, ma|king
&s;ome Difficulties and demanding Terms which
drove the King to u&s;e &s;ome Extremities with him,
and &s;topt the <HI>Swedes</HI> for a while, who had other|wi&s;e
been on the Banks of the <HI>Elbe</HI> as &s;oon as
<HI>Tilly</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> General had entred <HI>Saxony,</HI>
which if they had done, the mi&s;erable De&s;tru|ction
of <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> had been prevented, as I
ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">
The King had been invited into the Union, and
when he fir&s;t came back from the Banks of the
<HI>Oder</HI> he had accepted it, and was preparing to
back it with all his Power.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> had already a good Ar|my,
which he had with infinite Diligence re|cruited,
and mu&s;tered them under the Cannon
of <HI>Leip&s;ick.</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having, by his
Ambal&s;ador at <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> entred into the Union of
the Prote&s;tants, was advancing victoriou&s;ly to
their Aid, ju&s;t as Count <HI>Tilly</HI> had enter'd the Duke
of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Dominions. The Fame of the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI>
Conque&s;ts, and of the Hero who command|ed
them, &s;hook my Re&s;olution of travelling in|to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> being re&s;olved to &s;ee the Conjunction
of the Prote&s;tants Armies, and before the Fire
was broke out too far to take the Advantage of
feeing both &s;ides.</P>
<P>While I remained at <HI>Vienna,</HI> uncertain which
Way I &s;hould proceed; I remember I ob&s;erved
they talked of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> as a Prince
of no Con&s;ideration, one that they might let go
on and tire him&s;elf in <HI>Mecklenbergh,</HI> and there|about,
till they could find Lei&s;ure to deal with
him, and then might be cru&s;hed as they plea&s;ed,
but as 'tis never &s;afe to de&s;pi&s;e an Enemy, &s;o this
was not an Enemy to be <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed,</HI> as they after|wards
found.</P>
<P>As to the Conclu&s;ions of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> indeed at
fir&s;t they gave the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court &s;ome Unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
but when they found the <HI>Imperial</HI> Armies
began to fright the Members out of the Union,
and that the &s;everal Branches had no con&s;iderable
Forces on Foot, it was the general Di&s;cour&s;e at
<HI>Vienna,</HI> that the Union at <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> only gave the
Emperor an Opportunity to cru&s;h ab&s;olutely
the Dukes of <HI>Saxony, Brandenburgh,</HI> and the Land|grave
<PB N="46" REF="52">
of <HI>He&s;&s;e;</HI> and they looked upon it as a
Thing certain.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw any real Concern in their Faces at
<HI>Vienna,</HI> 'till News came to Court that the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had entered into the Union; but as
this made them very unea&s;ie, they began to move
the powerfulle&s;t Methods po&s;&s;ible to divert this
Storm; and upon this News <HI>Tilly</HI> was ha&s;tened
to fall into <HI>Saxony</HI> before this Union could pro|ceed
to a Conjunction of Forces. This was certain|ly
a very good Re&s;olution, and no Mea&s;ure could
have been more exactly concerted had not the Di|ligence
of the <HI>Saxons</HI> prevented it.</P>
<P>The gathering of this Storm, which from a
Cloud began to &s;pread over the Empire, and from
the little Dutchyof <HI>Mecklenburgh</HI> began to threaten
all <HI>Germany,</HI> ab&s;olutely determined me, as I noted
before, as to travelling; and laying a&s;ide the
Thoughts of <HI>Hungary,</HI> I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to
&s;ee the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Army.</P>
<P>I parted from <HI>Vienna</HI> the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and
took po&s;t for <HI>Great Glogau</HI> in <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> as if I had
purpo&s;ed to pa&s;s into <HI>Poland,</HI> but de&s;igning indeed
to go down the <HI>Oder</HI> to <HI>Cu&s;trin</HI> in the Marqui&s;ate
of <HI>Brandenburgh;</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Berlin;</HI> but when I came
to the Frontiers of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> tho' I had Pa&s;&s;es I
could go no farther, the Guards on all the
Frontiers were &s;o &s;trict; &s;o I was obliged to come
back into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> &s;o and went to <HI>Prague.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I found I could ea&s;ily pa&s;s through
the <HI>Imperial</HI> Provinces to the <HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> and
accordingly took Pa&s;&s;es for <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> de&s;igning
however to u&s;e them no farther than I found
Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>By Virtue of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;es I got into the <HI>Im|perial</HI>
Army, under Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> then at the Siege
of <HI>Magdenburgh, May</HI> the 2d.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53">
I confe&s;s I did not fore&s;ee the Fate of this Ci|ty,
neither I believe did Count <HI>Tilly</HI> him&s;elf ex|pect
to glut his Fury with &s;o entire a De&s;ola|tion,
much le&s;s did the People expect it. I did
believe they mu&s;t capitulate, and I perceived by
Di&s;cour&s;e in the Army, that <HI>Tilly</HI> would give them
but very indifferent Conditions; but it fell out
otherwi&s;e; the Treaty of Surrender was as it
were begun, nay &s;ome &s;ay concluded, when &s;ome
of the Out-guards of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> finding the
Citizens had abandoned the Guards of the Works,
and looked to them&s;elves with le&s;s Diligence than
u&s;ual, they broke in, carried an Half-Moon
Sword in Hand with little Re&s;i&s;tance; and tho'
it was a Surprize on both Sides, the Citizens
neither fearing, nor the Army expecting the
Occa&s;ion, the Garri&s;on, with as much Re&s;olution
as could be expected under &s;uch a Fright, flew
to the Walls, twice beat the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> off, but
fre&s;h Men coming up, and the Admini&s;trator of
<HI>Magdenburgh</HI> him&s;elf being wounded and taken,
the Enemy broke in, took the City by Storm,
and entred with &s;uch terrible Fury, that with|out
Re&s;pect to Age or Condition, they put all
the Garri&s;on and Inhabitants, Man, Woman and
Child, to the Sword, plundered the City, and
when they had done this, &s;et it on Fire.</P>
<P>This Calamity &s;ure was the dreadfulle&s;t Sight
that ever I &s;aw; the Rage of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Sol|diers
was mo&s;t intolerable, and not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed;
of 25000, &s;ome &s;aid 30000 People, there
was not a Soul to be &s;een alive, till the Flames
drove tho&s;e that were hid in Vaults and &s;ecret
Places to &s;eek Death in the Streets, rather than
peri&s;h in the Fire: Of the&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures
&s;ome were killed too by the furious Soldiers, but
at la&s;t they &s;aved the Lives of &s;uch as came out
<PB N="48" REF="54">
of their Cellars and Holes, and &s;o about 2000
poor de&s;perate Creatures were left: The exact
Number of tho&s;e that peri&s;hed in this City could
never be known, becau&s;e tho&s;e the Soldiers had
fir&s;t butcher'd, the Flames afterwards devour'd.</P>
<P>I was on the other Side the <HI>Elbe</HI> when this
dreadful Piece of Butchery was done; the City
of <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> had a Sconce or Fort over again&s;t
it, called the Toll-Hou&s;e, which joined to the
City by a very fine Bridge of Boats.</P>
<P>This Fort was taken by the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI>
a few Days before, and having a Mind to &s;ee it,
and the rather becau&s;e from thence I could have
a very good View of the City, I was gone over
<HI>Tilly</HI>'s Bridge of Boats to view this Fort; about
10 a Clock in the Morning I perceived they were
&s;torming by the firing, and immediately all ran
to the Works, I little thought of the taking the
City, but imagined it might be &s;ome Out-work
attacked, for we all expected the City would
&s;urrender that Day, or next, and they might
have capitulated upon very good Terms.</P>
<P>Being upon the Works of the Fort, on a &s;udden
I heard the dreadfulle&s;t Cry rai&s;ed in the City
that can be imagined, 'tis not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s
the Manner of it, and I could &s;ee the Women and
Children running about the Streets in a mo&s;t
lamentable Condition.</P>
<P>The City Wall did not run along the Side
where the River was with &s;o great a Heighth
but we could plainly &s;ee the Market-Place and
the &s;everal Streets which run down to the River;
In about an Hour's Time after this fir&s;t Cry all
was Confu&s;ion; there was little &s;hooting, the
Execution was all cutting of Throats and meer
Hou&s;e Murthers; the re&s;olute Garri&s;on, with the
<PB N="49" REF="55">
brave Baron <HI>Falconberg</HI> fought it out to the la&s;t,
and were cut in. Pieces, and by this Time the
<HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers having broke open the Gates
and entred on all Sides, the Slaughter was very
dreadful, we could &s;ee the poor People in Crowds
driven down the Streets, flying from the Fury
of the Soldiers who followed butchering them
as fa&s;t as they could, and refu&s;ed Mercy to any
Body; 'till driving them to the River's Edge,
the de&s;perate Wretches would throw them&s;elves
into the River, where Thou&s;ands of them pe|ri&s;hed,
e&s;pecially Women and Children; &s;everal
Men that could &s;wim got over to our Side, where
the Soldiers not heated with Fight gave them
Quarter, and took them up, and I cannot but do
this Ju&s;tice to the <HI>German</HI> Officers in the Fort, they
had five &s;mall flat Boats, and they gave leave to the
Soldiers to go off in them, and get what Booty
they could, but charged them not to kill any
Body, but take them all Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Nor was their Humanity ill rewarded, for the
Soldiers wi&s;ely avoiding tho&s;e Places where their
Fellows were employed in the butchering the
mi&s;erable People, rowed, to other Places, where
Crouds of People &s;tood crying out for help, and
expecting to be every Minute either drowned
or murdered; of the&s;e at &s;undry Times they
fetched over near Six hundred, but took Care to
take in none but &s;uch as offered them good Pay.</P>
<P>Never was Money or Jewels of greater Service
than now, for tho&s;e that had any Thing of that:
&s;ort to offer were &s;oone&s;t helped.</P>
<P>There was a Burgher of the Town, who &s;eeing
a Boat coming near him, but out of his Call, by
the help of a &s;peaking Trumpet, told the Sol|diers
in it he would give them 20000 Dollers to
fetch him off; they rowed clo&s;e to the Shore,
<PB N="50" REF="56">
and got him with his Wife and &s;ix Children into
the Boat, but &s;uch Throngs of People got about
the Boat that had like to have &s;unk her, &s;o that
the Soldiers were fain to drive a great many
out again by main Force, and while they were
doing this, some of the Enemies coming down
the Street de&s;perately drove them all into the
Water.</P>
<P>The Boat however brought the Burgher and
his Wife and Children &s;afe, and though they had
not all that Wealth about them, yet in jewels
and Money he gave them, &s;o much as made all
the Fellows very rich.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to de&s;cribe the Cruelty of
this Day, the Town by five in the Afternoon
was all on a Flame; the Wealth con&s;umed was
ine&s;timable, and a Lo&s;s to the very Conqueror.
I think there was little or nothing left but the
great Church, and about 100 Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ad Welcome into the Army for
me, and gave me a Horror and Aver&s;ion to the
Emperor's People, as well as to his Cau&s;e. I quitted
the Camp the third Day after this Execution,
while the Fire was hardly out in the City; and from
thence getting &s;afe Conduct to pa&s;s into the <HI>Palati|nate,</HI>
I turned out of the Road at a &s;mall Village on
the <HI>Elbe,</HI> called <HI>Emerfield,</HI> and by Ways and Town I
can give but &s;mall Account of having a Boor for
our Guide, who we could hardly under&s;tand.
I arrived at <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> on the 17th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>We found the Elector inten&s;e upon the &s;trength|ening
of his Army, but the People, in the great|e&s;t
Terror imaginable, every Day expecting <HI>Tilly</HI>
with the <HI>German</HI> Army, who by his Cruelty at
<HI>Magdeburg</HI> was become &s;o dreadful to the Pro|te&s;tants,
that they expected no Mercy where-ever
he came.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57">
The Emperor's Power was made &s;o formidable
to all the Prote&s;tants, particularly &s;ince the Diet at
<HI>Ratisbon</HI> left them in a wor&s;e Ca&s;e than it found
them, that they had not only formed the Con|clu&s;ions
of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> which all Men looked on as
the Effect of De&s;peration rather than any pro|bable
Means of their Deliverance, but had pri|vately
implored the Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
foreign Powers, and particularly the King of <HI>Swe|den,</HI>
from whom they had Promi&s;es of a &s;peedy and
powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance. And truly if the <HI>Swede</HI> had
not with a very &s;trong Hand re&s;cued them, all
their Conclu&s;ions at <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> had &s;erved but to
ha&s;ten their Ruin. I remember very well when
I was in the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army they di&s;cour&s;ed with
&s;uch Contempt of the Forces of the Prote&s;tants,
that not only the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> but the Prote&s;tants
them&s;elves gave them up as lo&s;t: the Emperor
had not le&s;s than 200000 Men in &s;everal Armies
on Foot, who mo&s;t of them were on the back
of the Prote&s;tants in every Corner. If <HI>Tilly</HI> did
but Write a threatning Letter to any City of
Prince of the Union, they pre&s;ently &s;ubmittted,
renounced the Conclu&s;ions of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> and re|ceived
<HI>Imperial</HI> Garri&s;ons, as the Cities of <HI>&V;l$</HI>
and <HI>Memingen,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and &s;e|veral
others, and almo&s;t all <HI>Suaben.</HI></P>
<P>Only the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> and the Landgrave of
<HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> upheld the drooping Courage of the Pro|te&s;tants,
and refu&s;ed all Terms of Peace; &s;light|ed
all the Threatnings of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Generals,
and the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> was brought in
afterward almo&s;t by Force.</P>
<P>The Duke Of <HI>Saxony</HI> mu&s;tered his Forces un|der
the Walls of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> and I having returned

<PB N="52" REF="58">
through the Ranks, attended by his Field Mar|&s;hal
<HI>Arnheim,</HI> and &s;eemed mighty well plea&s;ed
with them, and indeed the Troops made a very
fine Appearance; but I that had &s;een <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Ar|my,
and his old Weather-beaten Soldiers, who&s;e
Di&s;cipline and Exerci&s;es were &s;o exact, and their
Courage &s;o often tried, could not look on the
<HI>Saxon</HI> Army without &s;ome Concern for them,
when I con&s;idered who they had to deal with;
<HI>Tilly</HI>'s Men were rugged &s;urly Fellows, their Faces
had an Air of hardy Courage, mangled with
Wounds and Scars, their Armour &s;hewed the
Brui&s;es of Mu&s;quet Bullets, and the Ru&s;t of the
Winter Storms: I ob&s;erved of them their Cloaths
were always dirty, but their Arms were clean
and bright; they were u&s;ed to camp in the
open Fields, and &s;leep in the Fro&s;ts and Rain;
their Hor&s;es were &s;trong and hardy like them|&s;elves,
and well taught their Exerci&s;es; the Sol|diers
knew their Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o exactly that gene|ral
Orders were enough; every private Man
was fit to command, and their Wheelings, March|ings,
Countermarchings and Exerci&s;es were done
with &s;uch Order and Readine&s;s that the di&s;tinct
Words of Command were hardly of any u&s;e a|mong
them; they were flu&s;hed with Victory, and
hardly knew what it was to fly.</P>
<P>There had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Me&s;&s;ages between <HI>Tilly</HI>
and the Duke, and he gave always &s;uch ambi|guous

Words, and drawing his Army towards <HI>Saxony,</HI>
&s;ends four Propo&s;itions to him to &s;ign, and de|mands

decamped with his whole Army for <HI>Tor|gau,</HI>
fearing that <HI>Tilly</HI> &s;hould get there before
him, and &s;o prevent his Conjunction with the
<HI>Swede.</HI> The Duke had not yet concluded any
po&s;itive Treaty with the King of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and
the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> having made &s;ome Dif|ficulty
of joining, they both &s;tood on &s;omee Nice|ties
till they had like to have ruined them&s;elves
all at once.</P>
<P><HI>Brandenburgh</HI> had given up the Town of <HI>Spandau</HI>
to the King by a former Treaty to &s;ecure a Re|treat
for his Army, and the King was advanced
as far as <HI>Francfort</HI> upon the <HI>Oder,</HI> when on a &s;udden
&s;ome &s;mall Difficulties ari&s;ing <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> &s;eems
cold in the Matter, and with a &s;ort of Indifference
demands to have his Town of <HI>Spandau</HI> re&s;tored to
him again. <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> who began pre&s;ently
to imagine thp Duke had made his Peace with the
<PB N="54" REF="60">
Emperor, and &s;o would either be his Enemy, or
pretend a Neutrality, generou&s;ly delivered him
hisTown of <HI>Spandau;</HI> but immediately turns about,
and with his whole Army be&s;ieges him in his Capi|tal
City of <HI>Berlin.</HI> This brought the Duke to know
his Error, and by the Interpo&s;ition of the Ladies,
the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> being the Duke's Si&s;ter, the
Matter was accommodated, and the Duke joined
his Forces with the King.</P>
<P>But the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> had like to have been
undone by this Delay, for the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> under
Count <HI>de Fur&s;temburgh,</HI> were entred his Country, and
had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of <HI>Hall,</HI> and <HI>Tilly</HI> was on
his March to join him, as he afterwards did, and
ravaging the whole Country laid Siege to <HI>Leip|&s;ick</HI>
it &s;elf; the Duke driven to this Extremity
rather flies to the <HI>Swede</HI> than treats with him, and
on the &s;econd of <HI>September</HI> the Duke's Army joined
with the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I had not come to <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> but to &s;ee the Duke
of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Army, and that being marched as I
have &s;aid, for <HI>Torgau</HI> I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s there:
but if I had, the approach of <HI>Tilly</HI> and the <HI>Im|perial</HI>
Army was enough to ha&s;ten me away,
for I had no Occa&s;ion to be be&s;ieged there;
&s;o on the 27th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> I left the Town, as &s;everal
of the principal Inhabitants had done before,
and more would have done had not the Governor
publi&s;hed a Proclamation again&s;t it; and be&s;ides
they knew not whether to fly, for all Places
were alike expo&s;ed, the poor People were under
dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of a Siege, and of the
mercile&s;s U&s;age of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers, the
Example of <HI>Magdeburgh</HI> being fre&s;h before them,
the Duke and his Army gone from them, and
the Town, though well-furni&s;hed, but indifferent|ly
fortified.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="61">
In this Condition I left them, buying up Stores
of Provi&s;ions, working hard to &s;cour their Moats,
&s;et up Pali&s;adoes, repair their Fortifications, and
preparing all Things for a Siege and following the
<HI>Saxon</HI> Army to <HI>Torgau,</HI> I continued in the Camp till
a few Days before they joined the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I had much ado to per&s;uade my Companion
from entring into the Service of the Duke of
<HI>Saxony,</HI> one of who&s;e Collonels, with whom we
had contracted a particular Acquaintance, offering
him a Commi&s;&s;ion to be Cornet in one of the old
Regiments of Hor&s;e; but the Difference I had
ob&s;erved between this new Army and <HI>Tilly</HI>'s old
Troops had made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion on me, that
I confe&s;s I had yet no manner of Inclination for
the Service; and therefore per&s;uaded him to
wait a while till we had &s;een a little further into
Affairs, and particularly till we had &s;een the
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army, which we had heard &s;o much of.</P>
<P>The Difficulties which the Elector Duke of
<HI>Saxony</HI> made of joining with the King were made
up by a Treaty concluded with the King on the
2d of <HI>September</HI> at <HI>Co&s;wig,</HI> a &s;mall Town on the <HI>Elbe,</HI>
whither the King's Army was arrived the Night
before; for General <HI>Tilly</HI> being now entered
into the Duke's Country, had plundered and
ruined all the lower part of it, and was now
actually be&s;ieging the Capital City of <HI>Leip&s;ick.</HI>
The&s;e Nece&s;&s;ities made almo&s;t any Conditions
ea&s;y to him, the greate&s;t Difficulty was that
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> demanded the ab&s;olute Com|mand
of the Army, which the Duke &s;ubmitted
to with le&s;s good Will than he had Rea&s;on to do,
the King's Experience and Conduct con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I had not Patience to attend the Conclu&s;ions
of their particular Treaties, but as &s;oon as ever
the Pa&s;&s;age was clear I quitted the <HI>Saxon</HI> Camp,
<PB N="56" REF="62">
and went to &s;ee the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army; I fell in with
the Our-guards of the <HI>Swedes</HI> at a little Town
called <HI>Belt&s;ig,</HI> on the River <HI>Wer&s;a,</HI> ju&s;t as they
were relieving the Guards, and going to march,
and having a Pa&s;s from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador
was very well received by the Officer who
changed the Guards, and with him I went back
into the Army; by nine in the Morning the Army
was in full March, the King him&s;elf at the Head
of them on a gray Pad, and riding from one
Brigade to another, ordered the March of every
Line him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Troops, their exact
Di&s;cipline, their Order, the Mode&s;ty and Fami|liarity
of their Officers, and the regular living of
the Soldiers, their Camp &s;eemed a well ordered
City; the meane&s;t Country Woman with her
<HI>Market Ware</HI> was as &s;afe from Violence as in the
Streets of <HI>Vienna:</HI> There was no Regiments of
Whores and Rags as followed the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts;</HI> nor
any Women in the Camp, but &s;uch as being known
to the Provo&s;ts to be the Wives of the Soldiers,
who were nece&s;&s;ary for wa&s;hing Linen, taking
Care of the Soldiers Cloaths, and dre&s;&s;ing their
Victuals.</P>
<P>The Soldiers were well clad, not gay, furni&s;hed
with excellent Arms, and exceeding careful of
them; and though they did not &s;eem &s;o terrible
as I thought <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Men did when I fir&s;t &s;aw
them, yet the Figure they made, together with
what we had heard of them, made them &s;eem
to me invincible: The Di&s;cipline and Order of
their Marchings, Camping and Exerci&s;e was
excellent and &s;ingular, and which was to be &s;een
in no Armies but the King's, his own Skill,
Judgment and Vigilance having added much to
the general Conduct of Armies then in u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="63">
As I met the <HI>Swedes</HI> on their March I had no
Opportunity to acquaint my &s;elf with any Body
'till after the Conjunction of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Army,
and then it being but four Days to the great
Battle of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> our Acquaintance was but
&s;mall, &s;aving what fell out accidentally by Con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I met with &s;everal Gentlemen in the King's
Army who &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well, be&s;ides that
there were 3 Regiments of <HI>Scots</HI> in the Army,
the Collonels whereof I found were extraordi|narily
e&s;teemed by the King, as the Lord <HI>Rea,</HI>
Collonel <HI>Lum&s;dell,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Hepburn:</HI> The
latter of the&s;e, after I had by an Accident become
Acquainted with, I found had been for many
Years acquainted with my Father, and on that
Account I received a great deal of Civility from
him, which afterwards grew into a kind of
intimate Friendship; he was a compleat Soldier
indeed, and for that Rea&s;on &s;o well beloved by
that gal$ant King, that he hardly knew how to go
about any great Action without him.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for me now to re&s;train my
young Comrade from entring into the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
Service, and indeed every Thing was &s;o invi|ting
that I could not blame him. A Captain in
Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI>'s Regiment had picked Acquain|tance
with him, and he having as much Gallan|try
in his Face as real Courage in his Heart,
the Captain had per&s;uaded him to take Service,
and promi&s;ed to u&s;e his Intere&s;t to get him a
Company in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Brigade. I had made him
promi&s;e me not to part from me in my Tra|vels
without my Con&s;ent, which was the only
Ob&s;tacle to his De&s;ires of entring in the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI>
Pay; and being one Evening in the Cap|tain's
Tent with, him, and di&s;cour&s;ing very free|ly
<PB N="58" REF="64">
together, the Captain asked him very &s;hort
tout friendly, and looking earne&s;tly at me, <HI>Is
this the Gentleman, Mr.</HI> Fielding, <HI>that has done &s;o
much Prejudice to the King of</HI> Sweden'<HI>s Service?</HI> I
was doubly &s;urprized at the Expre&s;&s;ion, and
at the Collonel, Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> coming at
that very Moment into the Tent; the Collonel
hearing &s;omething of the Que&s;tion, but know|ing
nothing of the Rea&s;on of it, any more than as
I &s;eemed a little to concern my &s;elf at it; yet
after the Ceremony due to his Character was
over, would needs know what I had done to
hinder his Maje&s;ty's Service. <HI>So much truly, &s;ays
the Captain, that if his Maje&s;ty knew it he would
think him&s;elf very little beholding to him. I am &s;orry,</HI>
Sir, &s;ays I, <HI>that I &s;hould offend in any Thing, who am
but a Stranger; but if you would plea&s;e to inform me,
I wound endeavour to alter any Thing in my Behaviour
that is prejudicial to any one, much le&s;s to his Maje&s;ly's
Service. I &s;hall take you at your Word, Sir,</HI> &s;ays the
Captain; <HI>the King of</HI> Sweden, <HI>Sir, has a particular
Reque&s;t to you. I &s;hould be glad to know two Things,</HI>
Sir, &s;aid I, <HI>Fir&s;t, How that can be po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince I am
not known yet to any Man in the Army, much le&s;s to
his Maje&s;ty? And, Secondly, What the Reque&s;t can be?
Why, Sir, his Maje&s;ty de&s;ires you would not hinder this
Gentleman from entring into his Service, who it &s;eems de|&s;ires
nothing more, if he may have your Con&s;ent to it. I have
too much Honour for his Maje&s;ty,</HI> return'd I, <HI>to deny any
Thing which he plea&s;es to command me; but methinks 'tis
&s;ome Hard&s;hip, you &s;hould make that the King's Order,
which 'tis very probable he knows nothing of.</HI> Sir <HI>John
Heppburn</HI> took the Ca&s;e up &s;omething gravely, and
drinking a Gla&s;s of <HI>Lip&s;ick</HI> Beer to the Captain,
&s;aid, <HI>Come, Captain, don't pre&s;s the&s;e Gentlemen; the
King de&s;ires no Man's Service but what is purely Vo|luntier.</HI>
So we entred into other Di&s;cour&s;e, and
<PB N="59" REF="65">
the Collonel perceiving by my Talk that I had
&s;een <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army, was mighty curious in his
Que&s;tions, and &s;eemed very well &s;atisfied with
the Account I gave him.</P>
<P>The next Day the Army having pa&s;s'd the <HI>Elbe</HI>
at <HI>Wittemberg,</HI> and joyn'd the <HI>Saxon</HI> Army near
<HI>Torgau</HI> his Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed both Armies to draw
up in Battalia, giving every Brigade the &s;ame Po&s;t
in the Lines as he purpo&s;ed to fight in: I mu&s;t do
the Memory of that glorious General this Ho|nour,
that I never &s;aw an Army drawn up with &s;o
much Variety, Order, and exact Regularity &s;ince,
tho' I have &s;een many Armies drawn up by &s;ome
of the greate&s;t Captains of the Age; the Order
by which his Men were directed to flank and re|lieve-one
another, the Methods of receiving one
Body of Men if di&s;ordered into another, and ral|lying
one Squadron, without di&s;ordering ano|ther
was &s;o admirable; the Hor&s;e every where
flank'd, lin'd and defended by the Foot, and the
Foot by the Hor&s;e, and both by the Cannon, was
&s;uch, that if tho&s;e Orders were but as punctually
obey'd, 'twere impo&s;&s;ible to put an Army &s;o
modell'd into any Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The View being over, and the Troops return'd
to their Camps, the Captain with whom we
drank the Day before meeting me, told me I mu&s;t
come and &s;up with him in his Tent, where he
would ask my Pardon for the Affront he gave me
before. I told him he needed not put himlelf to
the Trouble; I was not affronted at all, that I
would do my &s;elf the Honour to wait on him,
provided he wou'd give me his Word not to &s;peak
any more of it as an Affront.</P>
<P>We lad not been a quarter of an Hour in his
Tent but Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> came in again, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing
to me, told me he was glad to find me
there; that he came to the Captain's Tent to en|quire
<PB N="60" REF="66">
how to &s;end to me; and that I mu&s;t do him
the Honour to go with him to wait on the King,
who had a Mind to hear the Account I could give
him of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army from my own Mouth.
I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was at &s;ome Lo&s;s in my Mind how
to make my Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty but I had
heard &s;o much of the conver&s;ible Temper of the
King, and his particular Sweetne&s;s of Humour
with the meane&s;t Soldier, that I made no more
Difficulty, but having paid my Re&s;pects to Collo|nel
<HI>Hepburn,</HI> thank'd him for the Honour he had
done me, and offered to ri&s;e and wait upon him:
Nay, &s;ays the Collonel, we will eat fir&s;t, for I find
<HI>Gourdon,</HI> which was the Captain's Name, has
got &s;omething for Supper, and the King's Order
is at &s;even a Clock: So we went to Supper, and
Sir <HI>John</HI> becoming very friendly, mu&s;t know my
Name; which, when I had told him, and of what
Place and Family, he ro&s;e from his Seat and em|bracing
me, told me he knew my Father very
well, and had been intimately acquainted with
him; and told me &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages wherein my
Father had particularly obliged him. After this
we went to Supper, and the King's Health being
drank round, the Collonel moved the &s;ooner be|cau&s;e
he had a Mind to talk with me; when we
were going to the King, he enquired of me where
I had been, and what Occa&s;ion brought me to the
Army. I told him the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of my Tra|vels,
and that I came hither from <HI>Vienna</HI> on pur|po&s;e
to &s;ee the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and his Army;
he ask'd me if there was any Service he could do
me, by which he meant, whether I de&s;ired an Em|ploy
ment; I pretended not to take him &s;o, but
told him the Protection his Acquaintance would
afford me was more than I could have ask'd, &s;ince
I might thereby have Opportunity to &s;atisfie my
<PB N="61" REF="67">
Curio&s;ity, which was the chief End of my coming
abroad. He perceiving by this that I had no
Mind to be a Soldier, told me very kindly I
&s;hould command him in any thing; that his Tent
and Equipage, Hor&s;es and Servants &s;hould always
have Orders to be at my Service: But that as a Piece
of Friendship, he would advi&s;e me to retire to
&s;ome Place di&s;tant from the Army, for that the
Army wou'd march to morrow, and the King was
re&s;olved to fight General <HI>Tilly,</HI> and he wou'd not
have me hazard my &s;elf: that if I thought fit to
take his Advice, he wou'd have me take that In|terval
to &s;ee the Court at <HI>Berlin,</HI> whither he
would &s;end one of his Servants to wait on me:
His Di&s;cour&s;e was too kind not to extort the
tendere&s;t Acknowledgment from me that I was
capable of; I told him his Care of me was &s;o o|bliging,
that I knew not what Return to make
him, but if he plea&s;ed to leave me to my Choice
I de&s;ired no greater Favour than to trail a Pike
under his Command in the en&s;uing Battle. I
can never an&s;wer it to your Father, &s;ays he, to
&s;uffer you to expo&s;e your &s;elf &s;o far. I told him
my Father would certainly acknowledge his
Friend&s;hip in the Propo&s;al made me; but I be|liev'd
he knew him better than to think he wou'd
be well pleas'd with me if I &s;hould accept of it;
that I was &s;ure my Father would have rod Po&s;t 500
Miles to have been at &s;uch a Battle under &s;uch a
General, and it &s;hould never be told him that his
Son had rod 50 Miles to be out of it: He &s;eem'd
to be &s;omething concern'd at the Re&s;olution I had
taken, and replied very quickly upon me, that
he approved very well of my Courage; but, &s;ays
he, no Man gets any Credit by running upon
needle&s;s Adventures, nor lo&s;es any by &s;hunning
Hazards which he has no Order for. 'Tis enough,
<PB N="62" REF="68">
&s;ays he, for a Gentleman to behave well when he
is commanded, upon any Service; I have had fight|ing
enough, &s;ays he, upon the&s;e Points of Honour,
and I never got any thing but Reproof for it from
the King him&s;elf. Well, Sir, &s;aid I, however if a
Man expects to ri&s;e by his Valour, he mu&s;t &s;hew
it &s;omewhere; and if I were to have any Com|mand
in an Army, I wou'd fir&s;t try whether I
could de&s;erve it: I have never yet &s;een any Ser|vice,
and mu&s;t have my Induction &s;ome time or
other: I &s;hall never have a better Schoolma&s;ter
than your &s;elf, nor a better School than &s;uch an
Army. Well, &s;ays Sir <HI>John,</HI> but you may have the
&s;ame School and the &s;ame teaching after this Bat|tle
is over; for I mu&s;t tell you before-hand, this
will be a bloody Touch; <HI>Tilly</HI> has a great Army
of old Lads that are u&s;ed to boxing Fellows with
Iron Faces, and 'tis a little too much to engage &s;o
hotly the fir&s;t Entrance into the Wars; You may
&s;ee our Di&s;cipline this Winter, and make your
Campaign with us next Summer, when you need
not fear but we &s;hall have fighting enough, and you
will be better acquainted with Things: We do
never put our common Soldiers upon Pitcht Bat|tles
the fir&s;t Campaign, but place our new Men in
Garri&s;ons and try them in Parties fir&s;t. Sir, &s;aid
I with a little more Freedom, I believe I &s;hall not
make a Trade of the War, and therefore need
not &s;erve an Apprentice&s;hip to it: 'Tis a hard Battle
where none e&s;capes: If I come off, I hope I &s;hall
not di&s;grace you, and if not, 'twill be &s;ome Sa|tisfaction
to my Father to hear his Son died fight|ing,
under the Command of Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> in the
Army of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and I de&s;ire no bet|ter
Epitaph upon my Tomb. Well, &s;ays Sir
<HI>John,</HI> and by this time we were ju&s;t come to the
King's Quarters, and the Guards calling to us in|terrupted

his Reply; &s;o we went into the Court
Yard where the King was lodg'd, which
was in an indifferent Hou&s;e of one of the Burgh|ers
of <HI>Debien,</HI> and Sir <HI>John</HI> &s;tepping up, met the
King coming down &s;ome Steps into a large Room
which looked over the Town-Wall into a Field
where Part of the Artillery was drawn up. Sir
<HI>John Hepburn</HI> &s;ent his Man pre&s;ently to me to come
up, which I did; and Sir <HI>John</HI> without any Cere|mony
carries me directly up to the King, who
was leaning on his Elbow in the Window: The
King turning about, this is the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|man,
&s;ays Sir <HI>John</HI> who I told your Maje&s;ty had
been in the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army. How then did he get
hither, &s;ays the King, without being taken by the
Scouts? At which Que&s;tion Sir <HI>John</HI> &s;aying nothing;
By a Pa&s;s, and plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, from the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Amba&s;&s;ador's Secretary at <HI>Vienna,</HI> &s;aid I,
making a profound Reverence. Have you then
been at <HI>Vienna,</HI> &s;ays the King? Yes, and plea&s;e
your Maje&s;ty, &s;aid I: upon which the King fold|ing
up a Letter he had in his Hand, &s;eemed much
more earne&s;t to talk about <HI>Vienna,</HI> than about <HI>Til|ly:</HI>
And pray what News had you at <HI>Vienna?</HI> No|thing,
Sir, &s;aid I, but daily Accounts one in the
Neck of another of their own Misfortunes, and your
Maje&s;ty's Conque&s;ts, which makes a very melan|choly
Court there. But pray, &s;aid the King, what is
the common Opinion there about the&s;e Affairs?
The common People are terrified to the la&s;t Degree,
&s;aid I, and when your Maje&s;ty took <HI>Frankfort</HI> up|on
<HI>Oder,</HI> if your Army had march'd but 20
Miles into <HI>&s;ile&s;ia,</HI> half the People wou'd have run
out of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and I left them fortifying the City.
They need not, reply'd the King &s;miling, I have
no De&s;ign to trouble them, 'tis the Prote&s;tant
Countries I mu&s;t be for: Upon this the Duke
<PB N="64" REF="70">
of <HI>Saxony</HI> entred the Room, and finding the King
engaged, offer'd to retire; but the King beckon|ing
with his Hand call'd to him in <HI>French,</HI> Cou&s;in,
&s;ays the King, this Gentleman has been travel|ling
and comes from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and &s;o made me re|peat
what I had &s;aid before; at which the King
went on with me, and Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> inform|ing
his Maje&s;ty that I &s;poke high <HI>Dutch,</HI> he
changed his Language, and ask'd me in <HI>Dutch</HI>
where it was that I &s;aw General <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army; I
told his Maje&s;ty at the Siege of <HI>Magdeburgh.</HI> At
<HI>Madeburgh;</HI> &s;aid the King &s;haking his Head;
<HI>Tilly</HI> mu&s;t an&s;wer to me one Day for that <HI>City,</HI>
and if not to me to a greater King than I: Can
you gue&s;s what Army he had with him, &s;aid the
King? He had two Armies with him, &s;aid I, but
one I &s;uppo&s;e will do your Maje&s;ty no harm: Two
Armies! &s;aid the King. Yes Sir, he has one Army
or about 26000 Men, &s;aid I, and another of above
15000 Whores and their Attendants; at which
the King laughed heartily; Ay, ay, &s;ays the
King, tho&s;e 15000 do us as much Harm as the
26000; for they eat up the Country, and de|vour
the poor Prote&s;tants more than the Men:
Well, &s;ays the King, do they talk of fighting us?
They talk big enough, Sir, &s;aid I, but your Maje&s;ty
has not been &s;o often fought with as beaten in
their Di&s;cour&s;e. I know not for the Men, &s;ays
the King, but the old Man is as likely to do it as
talk of it, and I hope to try them in a Day or
two: The King enquired after that, &s;everal Mat|rers
of me about the <HI>Law Countries,</HI> the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> and of the Court and Affairs in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
and Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> informing his Maje&s;ty
that I was the Son of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman of his
Acquaintance, the King had the Goodne&s;s to ask
him what Care he had taken of Me again&s;t the
<PB N="65" REF="71">
Day of Battle. Upon which Sir <HI>John</HI> repeated
to him the Di&s;cour&s;e we had together by the
Way; the King &s;eeming particularly plea&s;ed with
it, began to take me to Task him&s;elf: You <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Gentlemen, &s;ays he, are too forward in the
Wars, which makes you leave them too &s;oon again.
Your Maje&s;ty, reply'd I, makes War in &s;o plea|&s;ant
a Manner, as makes all the World fond
of fighting under your Conduct. Not &s;o plea&s;ant
neither, &s;ays the King, here's a Man can tell you
that &s;ometimes 'tis not very plea&s;ant. I know not
much of the Warrior, Sir, &s;aid I, nor of the
World, but if always to conquer be the plea&s;ure of
the War, your Maje&s;ty's Soldiers have all that
can be de&s;ired. Well, &s;ays the King, but however
con&s;idering all Things, I think you would do well
to take the Advice Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> has given you.
Your Maje&s;ty may command me to any Thing,
but where your Maje&s;ty and &s;o many gallant Gen|tleman
hazard their Lives, mine is not worth
mentioning; and I &s;hould not dare to tell my Fa|ther
at my return into <HI>England</HI> that I was in your
Maje&s;ty's Army, and made &s;o mean a Figure
that your Maje&s;ty's would not permit me to fight
under that Royal Standard. Nay, replied the King,
I &s;ay no Commands upon you, but you are young.
I can never dye, Sir, &s;aid I, with more Honour than
in your Maje&s;ty's Service; I &s;pake this with &s;o
much Freedom, and his Maje&s;ty was &s;o plea&s;ed
with it, that he asked me how I would choo&s;e to
&s;erve, on Hor&s;eback or on Foot; I told his Ma|je&s;ty
I &s;hould be glad to receive any of his Ma|je&s;ty's
Commands, but if I had not that Honour I
had purpos'd to trail a Pike under Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI>
who had done me &s;o much Honour as to introduce
me into his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence. Do &s;o then, re|ply'd
the King, and turning to Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="72">
&s;aid, and pray do you take Care of him; at which
overcome with the Goodne&s;s of his Di&s;cour&s;e I
could not an&s;wer a Word, but made him a pro|found
Reverence and retired.</P>
<P>The next Day but one, being the Seventh of
<HI>September,</HI> before Day the Army march'd from
<HI>Dieben</HI> to a large Field about a Mile from
<HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> where we found <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army in full Bat|talia
in admirable Order, which made a &s;hew both
glorious and terrible. <HI>Tilly,</HI> like a fair Gam&s;ter,
had taken up but one Side of the Plain, and left
the other free, and all the Avenues open for the
King's Army; nor did he &s;tir to the Charge 'till
the King's Army was compleatly drawn up and
advanced towards him: He had in his Army
44000 old Soldiers, every Way an&s;werable to
what I have &s;aid of them before; and I &s;hall only
add, a better Army I believe never was &s;o &s;oundly
beaten.</P>
<P>The King was not much inferior in Force, be|ing
joined with the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who were reckoned
22000 Men, and who drew up on the Left, ma|king
a main Battle and two Wings, as the King
did on the Right.</P>
<P>The King placed him&s;elf at the right Wing of
his own Hor&s;e; <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> had the main Bat|tle
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> had the main
Battle of his own Troops, and General <HI>Arnheim</HI>
the right Wing of his Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Line of the <HI>Swedes</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of the
two <HI>Scotch</HI> Brigades, and three <HI>Swedi&s;h,</HI> with the
<HI>Finland</HI> Hor&s;e in the Wings.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Fight, <HI>Tilly</HI>'s right Wing
charg'd with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible Fury upon the Left
of the King's Army where the <HI>Saxons</HI> were po&s;ted,
that nothing could with&s;tand them; the <HI>Saxons</HI>
fled amain, and &s;ome of them carried the News
<PB N="67" REF="73">
over the Country that all was lo&s;t, and the King's
Army overthrown; and indeed it pa&s;&s;ed for an
Over&s;ight with &s;ome, that the King did not place
&s;ome of his old Troops among the <HI>Saxons</HI> who were
new rai&s;ed Men; the <HI>Saxons</HI> lo&s;t here near 2000
Men, and hardly ever &s;hew'd their Faces again
all the Battle, except &s;ome few of their Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>I was po&s;ted with my Comrade, the Captain,
at the Head of three <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Regiments of Foot,
commanded by Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> with expre&s;s
Directions from the Collonel to keep by him: Our
Po&s;t was in the &s;econd Line, as a Re&s;erve to the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s main Battle, and which was
&s;trange, the main Battle, which con&s;i&s;ted of four
great Brigades of Foot, were never charged du|ring
the whole Fight; and yet we, who had the
Re&s;erve, were obliged to endure the whole Weight
of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army; the Occa&s;ion was, the
right Wing of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> having defeated
the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and being eager in the Chace, <HI>Tilly,</HI>
who was an old Soldier, and ready to prevent all
Mi&s;takes, forbids any Pur&s;uit; let them go, &s;ays
he, but let us beat the <HI>Swedes,</HI> or we do nothing.
Upon this the victorious Troops fall in upon the
Flank of the King's Army, which the <HI>Saxons</HI> be|ing
fled lay open to them; <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> com|manded
the left Wing of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and having
fir&s;t defeated &s;ome Regiments which charged him,
falls in upon the Rear of the <HI>Imperial</HI> right Wing,
and &s;eparates them from the Van, who were ad|vanced
a great Way forward in pur&s;uit of the
<HI>Saxons;</HI> and having routed the &s;aid Rear or Re|&s;erve,
falls on upon <HI>Tilly</HI>'s main Battle, and de|feated
Part of them, the other Part was gone in
Cha&s;e of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and now al&s;o returned, fell
in upon the Rear of the left Wing of the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
charging them in the Flank; for they drew
<PB N="68" REF="74">
up upon the very Ground which the <HI>Saxons</HI>
had quitted. This changed the whole Front, and
made the <HI>Swedes</HI> face about to the Left, and make
a great Front on their Flank to make this good;
our Brigades, who were placed as a Re&s;erve for the
main Battle, were by &s;pecial Order from the
King, wheeled about to the Left, and placed for
the Right of this new Front to charge the <HI>Imperi|ali&s;ts;</HI>
they were about 12 Thou&s;and of their be&s;t
Foot, be&s;ides Hor&s;e; and flu&s;ht with the Execu|tion
of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> fell on like Furies: The King
by this time had almo&s;t defeated the <HI>Imperiali&s;t</HI>'s
left Wing; their Hor&s;e with more Ha&s;te than good
Speed, had charged fa&s;ter than their Foot could
follow, and having broke into the King's fir&s;t
Line, he let them go; where, while the &s;econd
Line bears the Shock, and bravely re&s;i&s;ted them;
the King follows them on the Crupper with 13
Troops of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome Mu&s;queteers, by
which being hemm'd in, they were all cut down
in a Moment as it were, and the Army never di&s;|ordered
with them. This fatal Blow to the left
Wing, gave the King more Lei&s;ure to defeat the
Foot which followed, and to &s;end &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance
to <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> in his left Wing, who had his
Hands full with the main Battle of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>But tho&s;e Troops who, as I &s;aid, had routed the
<HI>Saxons,</HI> being called off from the Pur&s;uit, had
charged our Flank, and were now grown very
&s;trong, renewed the Battle in a terrible Manner:
Here it was I &s;aw our Men go to Wrack; Collo|nel
<HI>Hall,</HI> a brave Soldier, commanded the Rear of
the <HI>Swedes</HI> left Wing; he fought like a Lion, but
was &s;lain, and mo&s;t of his Regiment cut off, tho'
not unrevenged; for they entirely ruined <HI>Fur|&s;temberg</HI>'s
Regiment of Foot: Collonel <HI>Cullembach</HI>
with his Regiment of Hor&s;e, was extreamly over|laid
<PB N="69" REF="75">
al&s;o, and the Collonel and many brave Of|ficers
killed, and in &s;hort all that Wing was &s;hat|tered,
and in an ill Condition.</P>
<P>In this Juncture came the King, and having &s;een
what Havock the Enemy made of <HI>Cullembach</HI>'s
Troops, he comes riding along the Front of our
three Brigades, and him&s;elf led us on to the
Charge; the Collonel of his Guards, the Baron
<HI>Dyvel,</HI> was &s;hot dead ju&s;t as the King had given him
&s;ome Orders: When the <HI>Scots</HI> advanced, &s;econded
by &s;ome Regiments of Hor&s;e which the King al&s;o
&s;ent to the Charge, the bloodie&s;t Fight began
that ever Man beheld, for the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Brigades
giving Fire three Ranks at a Time over one ano|thers
Heads, pour'd in their Shot &s;o thick, that
the Enemy were cut down like Gra&s;s before a
Scyth; and following into the thicke&s;t of their
Foot with the Clubs of their Mu&s;quets, made a
mo&s;t dreadful Slaughter, and yet was there no
flying; <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Men might be killed and knocked
down, but no Man turned his Back, nor would
give an Inch of Ground, but as they were wheel'd,
or marched, or retreated by their Officers.</P>
<P>There was a Regiment of Cuira&s;&s;iers, which
&s;tood whole to the la&s;t, and fought like Lions,
they went ranging over the Field when all their
Army was broken, and no Body cared for charg|ing
them; they were commanded by Baron <HI>Cro|nenburgh,</HI>
and at la&s;t went off from the Battle
whole. The&s;e were armed in black Armour from
Head to Foot, and they carried off their
General; about Six a Clock the Field was cleared
of the Enemy, except at one Place on the King's
Side, where &s;ome of them rallied, and though
they knew all was lo&s;t would take no Quarter,
but fought it out to the la&s;t Man, being found
<PB N="70" REF="76">
dead the next Day in Rank and File as they
were drawn up.</P>
<P>I had the good Fortune to receive no Hurt in
this Battle, excepting a &s;mall Scratch on the &s;ide
of my Neck by the pu&s;h of a Pike; but my
Friend received a very dangerous Wound when
the Battle was as good as over; he had engaged
with a <HI>German</HI> Collonel who&s;e Name we could
never learn, and having killed his Man, and pre&s;|&s;ed
very clo&s;e upon him &s;o that he had &s;hot
his Hor&s;e, the Hor&s;e in the fall kept the Collonel
down, lying on one of his Legs, upon which he
demanded Quarter, which Captain <HI>Feilding</HI> grant|ing,
helped him to quit his Hor&s;e, and having
di&s;armed him, was bringing him into the Line,
when the Regiment of Cuira&s;&s;iers, which I men|tioned,
commanded by Baron <HI>Cronenburgh,</HI> came
roving over the Field, and with a flying Charge
&s;aluted our Front with a Salvo of Carabin-&s;hot,
which wounded us a great many Men, and a|mong
the re&s;t the Captain received a Shot in
his Thigh, which laid him on the Ground, and
being &s;eparated from the Line, his Pri&s;oner got
away with them.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t Service I was in, and in|deed
I never &s;aw any Fight &s;ince maintained
with &s;uch Gallantry, &s;uch de&s;perate Valour, to|gether
with &s;uch Dexterity of Management, both
Sides being compo&s;ed of Soldiers fully tried, bred
to the Wars, expert in every Thing, exact in their
Order, and uncapable of Fear, which made the
Battle be much more bloody than u&s;ual. Sir
<HI>John Hepburn,</HI> at my Reque&s;t, took particular Care
of my Comrade, and &s;ent his own Surgeon to
look after him; and afterwards when the City
of <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> was retaken, provided him Lodgings
<PB N="71" REF="77">
there, and came very often to &s;ee him; and in|deed
I was in great Care for him too, the Sur|geons
being very doubtful of him a great while;
for having lain in the Field all Night among
the Dead, his Wound, for want of dre&s;&s;ing, and
with the Extremity of Cold, was in a very ill
Condition, and the Pain of it had thrown him
into a Fever. 'Twas quite dusk before the Fight
ended, e&s;pecially where the la&s;t rallied Troops
fought &s;o long, and therefore we dur&s;t not break
our Order to &s;eek out our Friends, &s;o that 'twas
near &s;even o' Clock the next Morning before we
found the Captain, who though very weak by
the lo&s;s of Blood, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, and
placed his Back again&s;t the Buttock of a dead
Hor&s;e; I was the fir&s;t that knew him, and run|ning
to him, embraced him with a great deal
of Joy: He was not able to &s;peak, but made Signs
to let me &s;ee he knew me, &s;o we brought him
into the Camp, and Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> as I noted
before, &s;ent his own Surgeons to look after him.</P>
<P>The Darkne&s;s o$ the Night prevented any
Pur&s;uit, and was the only Refuge the Enemy
had left; for had there been three Hours more
Day-light, ten Thou&s;and more Lives had been
lo&s;t, for the <HI>Swedes</HI> (and <HI>Saxons</HI> e&s;pecially) en|raged
by the Ob&s;tinacy of the Enemy, were &s;o
throughly heated that they would have given
Quarter but to few; the Retreat was not found|ed
'till &s;even o' Clock, when the King drew up
the whole Army upon the Field of Battle, and
gave &s;trict Command that none &s;hould &s;tir from
their Order; &s;o the Army lay under their Arms
all Night, which was another rea&s;on why the
wounded; Soldiers &s;uffered very much by the Cold;
for the King, who had a bold Enemy to deal with,
was not ignorant what a &s;mall Body of de&s;pe|rate
<PB N="72" REF="78">
Men rallied together might have done in
the Darkne&s;s of the Night, and therefore he
lay in his Coach all Night at the Head of the Line,
though it froze very hard.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Day began to peep the Trum|pets
founded to Hor&s;e, and all the Dragoons
and Light Hor&s;e in the Army were commanded
to the Pur&s;uit; the Cuira&s;&s;iers and &s;ome com|manded
Mu&s;queteers advanced &s;ome Miles, if
need were, to make good their Retreat, and all
the Foot &s;tood to their Arms for a Re&s;erve;
but in half an Hour Word was brought to the
King, that the Enemy was quite di&s;per&s;ed, up|on
which Detachments were made out of every
Regiment to &s;earch among the Dead for any
of our Friends that were wounded and the
King him&s;elf gave a &s;trict Order, that if any
were found wounded and alive among the Ene|my
none &s;hould kill them, but take Care to bring
them into the Camp: A Piece of Humanity which
&s;aved the Lives of near a Thou&s;and of the
Enemies.</P>
<P>This Piece of Service being over, the Enemy's
Camp was &s;eized upon, and the Soldiers were
permitted to plunder it; all the Cannon, Arms,
and Ammunition was &s;ecured for the King's U&s;e,
the re&s;t was given up to the Soldiers, who found
&s;o much Plunder that they had no Rea&s;on to
quarrel for Shares.</P>
<P>For my &s;hare, I was &s;o bu&s;ie with my wounded
Captain that I got nothing but a Sword, which
I found ju&s;t by him when I fir&s;t &s;aw him; but
my Man brought me a very good Hor&s;e with a
Furniture on him, and one Pi&s;tol of extraordi|nary
Workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>I bad him get upon his Back and make the be&s;t
of the Day for him&s;elf, which he did, and I &s;aw
<PB N="73" REF="79">
him no more till three Days after, when he found
me out at <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> &s;o richly dre&s;&s;ed that I hard|ly
knew him; and after making his Excu&s;e for
his long Ab&s;ence, gave me a very plea&s;ant Ac|count
where he had been: He told me, that ac|cording
to my Order being mounted on the Hor&s;e
he had brought me, he fir&s;t rid into the Field
among the Dead, to get &s;ome Clothes &s;uitable
to the Equipage of his Hor&s;e, and having &s;eized
on a laced Coat, a Helmet, a Sword, and an ex|traordinary
good Cane; was re&s;olved to &s;ee
what was become of the Enemy, and following
the Track of the Dragoons, which he could ea|&s;ily
do by the Bodies on the Road, he fell in
with a &s;mall Party of 25 Dragoons, under no
Command but a Corporal, making to a Village
where &s;ome of the Enemies Hor&s;e had been quar|tered;
the Dragoons taking him for an Officer
by his Hor&s;e, de&s;ired him to command them,
told him the Enemy was very rich, and they
doubted not a good Booty: He was a bold brisk
Fellow, and told them, with all his Heart; but
&s;aid he had but one Pi&s;tol, the other being broke
with firing, &s;o they lent him a pair of Pi&s;tols,
and a &s;mall Piece they had taken, and he led
them on. There had been a Regiment of Hor&s;e
and &s;ome Troops of <HI>Crabats</HI> in the Village, but
they were fled on the fir&s;t Notice of the Pur|&s;uit,
excepting three Troops, and the&s;e on Sight
of this &s;mall Party, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be only
the fir&s;t of a greater Number, fled in the great|e&s;t
Confu&s;ion imaginable; they took the Village
and about 50 Hor&s;es, with all the Plunder of
the Enemy, and with the Heat of the Service
he had &s;poiled my Hor&s;e, he &s;aid, for which he
had brought me two more; for he pa&s;&s;ing for
the Commander of the Party, had all the Ad|vantage
<PB N="74" REF="80">
the Cu&s;tom of War gives an Officer in
like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>I was very well plea&s;ed with the Relation the
Fellow gave me, and laughing at him,</HI> Well, Cap|tain,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and what Plunder have ye got? Enough
to make me a Captain, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you plea&s;e, and
a Troop ready rai&s;ed too; for the Party of Dragoons are
po&s;ted in the Village by my Command, till they have
farther Orders. <HI>In &s;hort, he pulled out 60 or 70
Pieces of Gold, 5 or 6 Watches, 13 or 14 Rings,
whereof 2 were diamond Rings, one of which was
worth 50 Dollars; Silver as much as his Pockets
would hold, be&s;ides that he had brought three
Hor&s;es, two of which were laden with Baggage,
and a Boor he had hired to &s;tay with them at</HI>
Leip&s;ick <HI>till he had found me out.</HI> But I am a|fraid
Captain, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you have plundered the Village
in&s;tead of plundering the Enemy. No indeed not we,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but the <HI>Crabats</HI> had done it for us, and we
light of them just as they were carrying it off. Well,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but what will you do with your Men; for when
you come to give them Orders, they will know you well
enough? No, no, &s;ays he, I took Care of that; for
just now I gave a Soldier five Dollars to carry them
News that the Army was marched to <HI>Moersburgh,</HI>
and that they &s;hould follow thither to the Regiment.</P>
<P>Having &s;ecured his Money in my Lodgings,
he asked me if I plea&s;ed to &s;ee his Hor&s;es, and
to have one for my &s;elf? I told him I would go
and &s;ee them in the Afternoon; but the Fellow
being impatient goes and fetches them: There
was three Hor&s;es, one whereof was a very good
one, and by the Furniture was an Officer's Hor&s;e
of the <HI>Crabats,</HI> and that my Man would have me
accept, for the other he had &s;poiled, as he &s;aid;
I was but indifferently hor&s;ed before, &s;o I ac|cepted
of the Hor&s;e, and went down with him
<PB N="75" REF="81">
to &s;ee the re&s;t of his Plunder there; he had got
three or four pair of Pi&s;tols, two or three Bundles
of Officers Linen and Lace, a Field-Bed and a
Tent, and &s;everal other Things of Value; but
at la&s;t coming to a &s;mall Fardel, and this, &s;ays
he, I took whole from a <HI>Crabat</HI> running away
with it under his Arm, &s;o he brought it up in|to
my Chamber; he had not looked into it, he
&s;aid, but he under&s;tood 'twas &s;ome Plunder the
Soldiers had made, and finding it heavy took it
by Con&s;ent; we opened it and found 'twas a
Bundle of &s;ome Linen, 13 or 14 Pieces of
Plate, and in a &s;mall Cup three Rings, a fine
Necklace of Pearl, and the Value of 100 Rix-dollars
in Money. The Fellow was amazed at
his own good Fortune, and hardly knew what
to do with him&s;elf: I bid him go take Care of
his other Things, and of his Hor&s;es, and come
again; &s;o he went and di&s;charged the Boor that
waited, and packed up all his Plunder, and came
up to me in his old Clothes again. <HI>How now,
Captain,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>what have you altered your Equipage
already? I am no more a&s;hamed, Sir, of your Livery,</HI>
an&s;wered he, <HI>than of your Service, and neverthele&s;s
your Servant for what I have got by it. Well,</HI> &s;ays
I to him, <HI>but what will you do now with all your Mo|ney?
I wi&s;h my poor Father had &s;ome of it,</HI> &s;ays he,
<HI>and for the re&s;t I got it for you, Sir, and de&s;ire you
would take it.</HI> He &s;poke it with &s;o much Hone&s;ty
and Freedom that I could not but take it very
kindly; but however, I told him I would not
take a Farthing from him, as his Ma&s;ter; but I
would have him play the good Husband with
it now he had &s;uch good Fortune to get it: He told
me he would take my Directions in every Thing.
<HI>Why then,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>I'll tell you what I would advi&s;e you
to do, turn it all into ready Money, and convey it by
<PB N="76" REF="82">
Return home into</HI> England, <HI>and follow your &s;elf the
fir&s;t Opportunity, and with good Management you may
put your &s;elf in a good Po&s;ture of living with it.</HI> The
Fellow, with a &s;ort of Dejection in his Looks,
asked me, if he had di&s;obliged me in any Thing?
<HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays I: That I was willing to turn him out
of his Service. <HI>No,</HI> George, (that was his Name)
&s;ays I, <HI>but you may live on this Money without being
a Servant. I'd throw it all into the</HI> Elbe, &s;ays
he, <HI>over</HI> Torgaw <HI>Bridge, rather than leave your Ser|vice;
and be&s;ides,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>can't I &s;ave my Money
without going from you? I got it in your Service, and
I'll never &s;pend it out of your Service, unle&s;s you put me
away. I hope my Money won't make me the wor&s;e Servant,
if I thought it would, I'd &s;oon have little enough. Nay,</HI>
George, &s;ays I, <HI>I &s;hall not oblige you to it, for I am not
willing to lo&s;e you neither: come then,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>let us
put it all together, and &s;ee what it 'twill come to.</HI> So
he laid it all together on the Table, and by our
Computation he had gotten as much Plunder as
was worth about 1400 Rix-dollars, be&s;ides 3
Hor&s;es with their Furniture, a Tent, a Bed, and
&s;ome wearing Linen. Then he takes the Neck|lace
of Pearl, a very good Watch, a Diamond Ring,
and 100 Pieces of Gold, and lays them by them|&s;elves,
and having according to our be&s;t Calcula|tion
valued the Things, he put up all the re&s;t,
and as I was going to ask him what they were left
out for, he takes them up in his Hand, and coming
round the Table, told me, that if I did not think
him unworthy of my Service and Favour, he
begged I would give him leave to make that
Pre&s;ent to me; that it was my fir&s;t thought, his
going out; that he had got it all in my Service,
and he &s;hould think I had no Kindne&s;s for him
if I &s;hould refu&s;e it. I was re&s;olved in my Mind
not to take it from him, and yet I could find no
<PB N="77" REF="83">
Means to re&s;i&s;t his Importunity; at la&s;t I told
him, I would accept of Part of his Pre&s;ent, and
that I e&s;teemed his Re&s;pect in that as much as
the whole; and that I would not have him impor|tune
me farther, &s;o I took the Ring and Watch
with the Hor&s;e and Furniture as before, and
made him turn all the re&s;t into Money at <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI>
and not &s;uffering him to wear his Livery, made
him put him&s;elf into a tolerable Equipage, and
taking a young <HI>Leip&s;icker</HI> into my Service, he at|tended
me as a Gentleman from that Time
forward.</P>
<P>The King's Army never entred <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> but
proceeded to <HI>Moersburg,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Hall</HI>
and &s;o marched on into <HI>Franconia,</HI> while the Duke
of <HI>Saxony</HI> employed his Forces in recovering <HI>Leip|&s;ick</HI>
and the driving the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> out of his
Country. I continued at <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> 12 Days, being
not willing to leave my Comrade 'till he was
recovered; but Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> &s;o often impor|tuned
me to come into the Army, and &s;ent me
Word that the King had very often enquired for
me, that at la&s;t I con&s;ented to go without him;
&s;o having made our Appointment where to meet
and how to corre&s;pond by Letters, I went to wait
on Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> who then lay with the
King's Army at the City of <HI>Erfurt</HI> in <HI>Saxony.</HI> As
I was riding between <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI> I ob&s;erved
my Hor&s;e went very aukwardly and unea&s;y, and
&s;weat very much, though the Weather was cold,
and we had rid but very &s;oftly; I fancied there|fore
that the Saddle might hurt the Hor&s;e, and
calls my new Captain up; <HI>George</HI> &s;ay I, I believe
this Saddle hurts the Hor&s;e; &s;o we alighted and
looking under the Saddle found the Back of the
Hor&s;e extreamly galled; &s;o I bid him take off the
Saddle, which he did, and giving the Hor&s;e to my
<PB N="78" REF="84">
young <HI>Leip&s;icker</HI> to lead, we &s;at down to &s;ee if we
could mend it, for there was no Town near us;
Says <HI>George,</HI> pointing with his Finger, if you
plea&s;e to cut open the Pannel there, I'll get
&s;omething to &s;tuff into it which will bear it from
the Hor&s;e's Back; &s;o while he look'd for &s;ome|thing
to thru&s;t in, I cut a Hole in the Pannel of
the Saddle, and following it with my Finger I felt
&s;omething hard, which &s;eemed to move up and
down; again as I thru&s;t it with my Finger, here's
&s;omething that &s;hould not be here, &s;ays I, not yet
imagining what afterwards fell out, and calling,
run back, bad him put up his Finger; whatever
'tis, &s;ays he, 'tis this hurts the Hor&s;e, for it bears
ju&s;t on his Back when the Saddle is &s;et on; &s;o we
&s;trove to take hold on it, but could not reach it;
at la&s;t we took the upper Part of the Saddle quite
from the Pannel, and there lay a &s;mall Silk Pur&s;e
wrapt in a Piece of Leather, and full of Gold Du|cats;
thou art born to be rich, <HI>George,</HI> &s;ays I to
him, here's more Money, we opened the Pur&s;e
and found in it 438 &s;mall Pieces of Gold, there I
had a new Skirmi&s;h with him who&s;e the Money
&s;hould be; I told him 'twas his, he told me no,
I had accepted of the Hor&s;e and Furniture and
all that was about him was mine, and &s;olemnly
vow'd he wou'd not have a Penny of it: I &s;aw no
Remedy but put up the Money for the Pre&s;ent,
mended our Saddle, and went on; we lay that Night
at <HI>Hall,</HI> and having had &s;uch a Booty in the Saddle,
I made him &s;earch the Saddles of the other two
Hor&s;es; in one of which, we found Three <HI>French</HI>
Crowns, but nothing in the other.</P>
<P>We arrived at <HI>Erfurt</HI> the 28th of <HI>September,</HI> but
the Army was removed, and entred into <HI>Franco|nia,</HI>
and at the Siege of <HI>Koning &s;hoven</HI> we came up
with them. The fir&s;t thing I did, was to pay my
<PB N="79" REF="85">
Civilities to Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> who received me
very kindly, but told me withal, that I had not
done well to be &s;o long from him; that the King
had particularly enquired for me, had command|ed
him to bring me to him at my return: I told
him the Rea&s;on of my Stay at <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> and how I
had left that Place and my Comrade, before he
was cured of his Wounds, to wait on him accor|ding
to his Letters. He told me the King had
&s;poken &s;ome Things very obliging about me, and
he believed would offer me &s;ome Command in the
Army, if I thought well to accept of it; I told
him I had promi&s;ed my Father not to take Ser|vice
in an Army without his Leave; and yet if
his Maje&s;ty &s;hould offer it, I neither knew how
to re&s;i&s;t it, nor had I an Inclination to any thing
more than the Service, and &s;uch a Leader; tho'
I had much rather have &s;erv'd as a Volunteer at
my own Charge, (which as he knew was the
Cu&s;tom of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen) than in any
Command. He replied, do as you think fit;
but &s;ome Gentlemen would give 20000 Crowns
to &s;tand &s;o fair for Advancement as you do.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Koning&s;hoven</HI> capitulated that Day,
and Sir <HI>John</HI> was ordered to treat with the Citi|zens,
&s;o I had no farther Di&s;cour&s;e with him then;
and the Town being taken, the Army immedi|ately
advanced down the River <HI>Main,</HI> for the
King had his Eye upon <HI>Frankford</HI> and <HI>Mentz,</HI> two
great Cities, both which he &s;oon became Ma&s;ter
of, chiefly by the prodigious Expedition of his
March; For within a Month after the Battle, he
was in the lower Parts of the Empire, and had
pa&s;&s;ed from the <HI>Elb</HI> to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> an incredible
Conque&s;t; had taken all the Strong Cities, the
Bi&s;hopricks of <HI>Bambergh,</HI> of <HI>Wirtsburgh,</HI> and almo&s;t
all the Circle of <HI>Franconia,</HI> with Part of <HI>Schawber|land;</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="86">
a Conque&s;t large enough to be &s;even Year
a making by the common Cour&s;e of Arms.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s going on thus, the King had not Lei|&s;ure
to think of &s;mall Matters, and I being not
thoroughly re&s;olved in my Mind, did not pre&s;s Sir
<HI>John</HI> to introduce me; I had wrote to my Father
with an Account of my Reception in the Army,
the Civilities of Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> the Particulars
of the Battle, and had indeed pre&s;s'd him to give
me Leave to &s;erve the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> To which
Particular I waited for an An&s;wer, but the fol|lowing
Occa&s;ion determined me before an An&s;wer
cou'd po&s;&s;ibly reach me.</P>
<P>The King was before the Strong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ma|rienburgh,</HI>
which commands the City of <HI>Wurtsburgh;</HI>
he had taken the <HI>City,</HI> but the Garri&s;on and rich|er
Part of the Burghers were retir'd into the
Ca&s;tle, and tru&s;ting to the Strength of the Place,
which was thought impregnable, they bad the
<HI>Swedes</HI> do their wor&s;t; 'twas well provided with
all Things, and a &s;trong Garri&s;on in it; &s;o that the
Army indeed expected 'twould be a long Piece of
Work. The Ca&s;tle &s;tood on a high Rock, and
on the Steep of the Rock was a Ba&s;tion, which
defended the only Pa&s;&s;age up the Hill into the
Ca&s;tle; the <HI>Scots</HI> were cho&s;e out to make this at|tack,
and the King was an Eye Witne&s;s of their
Gallantry: In the Action Sir <HI>John</HI> was not com|manded
out, but Sir <HI>James Ram&s;ey</HI> led them on,
but I ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of the <HI>Scotch Officers</HI> in
the other Regiments prepared to &s;erve as Volun|teers
for the Honour of their Countrymen, and
Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> led them on: I was re&s;olved to
&s;ee this Piece of Service, and therefore joined my
&s;elf to the Volunteers; we were armed with Parti|zans,
and each Man two Pi&s;tols at our Be&s;t; it was
a Piece of Service that &s;eemed perfectly de&s;perate,
<PB N="81" REF="87">
the Advantage of the Hill, the Precipice we were
to mount, the height of the Ba&s;tion, the re&s;olute
Courage and Number of the Garri&s;on, who from
a compleat Covert made a terrible Fire upon us,
all joined to make the Action hopele&s;s; but the
Fury of the <HI>Scots</HI> Mu&s;queteers was not to be a|bated
by any Difficulties; they mounted the
Hill, &s;caled the Works like Madmen, running
upon the Enemies Pikes, and after two Hour's de|&s;perate
Fight in the mid&s;t of Fire and Smoke, took
it by Storm, and put all the Garri&s;on to the Sword.
The Voluntiers did their part, and had their Share
of the Lo&s;s too, for 13 or 14 were killed out of
37, be&s;ides the wounded, among whom I received
a Hurt more trouble&s;ome than dangerous, by a
Thru&s;t of a Halberd into my Arm, which proved
a very painful Wound, and I was a great while
before it was thoroughly recovered.</P>
<P>The King received us as we drew off at the
Foot of the Hill, calling the Soldiers <HI>his brave
Scots,</HI> and commending the Officers by Name.
The next Morning the Ca&s;tle was al&s;o taken by
Storm, and the greate&s;t Booty that ever was
found in any one Conque&s;t in the whole War;
the Soldiers got here &s;o much Money that they
knew not what to do with it and the Plunder they
got here and at the Battle of <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> made them &s;o
unruly, that had not the King' been the be&s;t
Ma&s;ter of Di&s;cipline in the World they had never
been kept in any rea&s;onable Bounds.</P>
<P>The King had taken Notice of our &s;mall Party
of Voluntiers, and though I thought he had not
&s;een me, yet he &s;ent the next Morning for Sir
<HI>John Hepburn,</HI> and asked him if I were not come
to the Army? <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;ays Sir <HI>John, he has been here two
or three Days:</HI> And as he was forming an Excu&s;e
<PB N="82" REF="88">
for not having brought me to wait on his Maje&s;ty,
&s;ays the King interrupting him, <HI>I wander you would
let him thru&s;t him&s;elf into &s;uch a hot Piece of Service
as &s;torming the</HI> Port Graft: <HI>Pray let him know I &s;aw
him, and have a very good Account of his Behaviour.</HI>
Sir <HI>John</HI> returned with this Account to me, and
pre&s;&s;ed me to pay my Duty to his Maje&s;ty the
next Morning; and accordingly, though I had
but an ill Night with the Pain of my Wound, I
was with him at the Levee in the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>I cannot but give &s;ome &s;hort Account of the
Glory of that Morning; the Ca&s;tle had been
cleared of the dead Bodies of the Enemies, and
what was not pillaged by the Soldiers, was
placed under a Guard. There was fir&s;t a Maga|zine
of very good Arms for about 18 or 20000
Foot, and 4000 Hor&s;e, a very good Train of Ar|tillery
of about 18 Pieces of Battery, 32 bra&s;s
Field-pieces and four Mortars. The Bi&s;hop's
Trea&s;ure, and other publick Monies not plun|dered
by the Soldiers, was telling out by the
Officers, and amounted to 100000 Florins in Mo|ney;
and the Burghers of the Town in &s;olemn
Proce&s;&s;ion, bareheaded, brought the King three
Tun of Gold as a Compo&s;ition to exempt the
City from Plunder. Here was al&s;o a Stable of gal|lant
Hor&s;es which the King had the Curio&s;ity
to go and &s;ee.</P>
<P>When the Ceremony of the Burghers was over
the King came down into the Ca&s;tle Court, walk|ed
on the Parade (where the great Train of Artil|lery
was placed on their Carriages) and round
the Walls, and gave Order for repairing the Ba|&s;tion
that was &s;tormed by the <HI>Scots;</HI> and as at
the Entrance of the Parade Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> and
I made our Reverence to the King, <HI>Ho, Cavalier,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="89">
&s;aid the King to me, <HI>I am glad to &s;ee you,</HI> and &s;o
pa&s;&s;ed forward; I made my bow very low, but
his Maje&s;ty &s;aid no more at that Time.</P>
<P>When the View was over the King went up
into the Lodgings, and Sir <HI>John</HI> and I walked in an
Anti-Chamber for about a Quarter of an Hour,
when one of the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber
came out to Sir <HI>John,</HI> and told him the King ask'd
for him; he &s;taid but a little with the King and
came out to me, and told me the King had or|dered
him to bring me to him.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, with a Countenance full of Ho|nour
and Goodne&s;s interrupted my Compliment,
and asked me how I did; at which an&s;wering only
with a bow, &s;ays the King, <HI>I am &s;orry to &s;ee you
are hurt, I would have laid my Commands on you not to
have &s;hewn your &s;elf in &s;o &s;harp a Piece of Service, if I
had known you had been in the Camp. Your Maje&s;ty
does me too much Honour,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>in your Care of a
Life that has yet done nothing to de&s;erve your Favour.</HI>
His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to &s;ay &s;omething very
kind to me relating to my Behaviour in the Battle
of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> which I have not Vanity enough to
write; at the Conclu&s;ion whereof, when I replyed
very humbly, that I was not &s;en&s;ible that any
Service I had done or could do could po&s;&s;ibly
merit &s;o much Goodne&s;s; he told me he had
ordered me a &s;mall Te&s;timony of his E&s;teem, and
withal gave me his Hand to ki&s;s: I was now
conquered, and with a &s;ort of Surprize, told his
Maje&s;ty, I found my &s;elf of much engaged by his
Goodne&s;s, as well as my own Inclination, that if
his Maje&s;ty would plea&s;e to accept of my Devoir
I was re&s;olved to &s;erve in his Army, or where|ever
he plea&s;ed to command me. <HI>Serve me,</HI> &s;ays
the King, <HI>why &s;o you do, but I mu&s;t not have you be a
Musketeer; a poor Soldier at a Dollar a Week will do
<PB N="84" REF="90">
that. Pray, Sir</HI> John, &s;ays the King, give him what
Commi&s;&s;ion he de&s;ires. No Commi&s;&s;ion, Sir,
&s;ays I, <HI>would plea&s;e me better than Leave to fight near
your Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, and to &s;erve you at my own Charge
till I am qualified by more Experience to receive your
Commands. Why then it &s;hall be &s;o,</HI> &s;aid the King,
<HI>and I charge you,</HI> Hepburn, &s;ays he, <HI>when any Thing
offers that is either fit for him, or he de&s;ires, that you tell
me of it,</HI> and giving me his Hand again to ki&s;s I
withdrew.</P>
<P>I was followed before I had pa&s;&s;ed the Ca&s;tle-Court
by one of the King's Pages, who brought
me a Warrant directed to Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> to go
to the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e for an immediate
delivery of Things ordered by the King him&s;elf
for my Account, where being come, the Querry
produced me a very good Coach with four Hor&s;es,
Harne&s;s and Equipage, and two very fine Saddle-Hor&s;es
out of the Stable of the Bi&s;hop's Hor&s;es,
afore-mentioned; with the&s;e there was a Li&s;t for
three Servants, and a Warrant to the Steward of
the King's Baggage to defray me, my Hor&s;es
and Servants at the King's Charge till farther
Order. I was very much at a Lo&s;s how to ma|nage
my &s;elf in this &s;o &s;trange freedom of &s;o
great a Prince, and con&s;ulting with Sir <HI>John
Hepburn,</HI> I was propo&s;ing to him whether it was
not proper to go immediately back to pay my
Duty to his Maje&s;ty and acknowledge his Bounty
in the be&s;t Terms I could; but while we were
re&s;olving to do &s;o, the Guards &s;tood to their Arms,
and we &s;aw the King go out at the Gate in his
Coach to pa&s;s into the City, &s;o we were diverted
from it for that Time. I acknowledge the
Bounty of the King was very &s;urpri&s;ing, but I
mu&s;t &s;ay it was not &s;o very &s;trange to me when
I afterward &s;aw the Cour&s;e of his Management;
<PB N="85" REF="91">
Bounty in him was his natural Talent, but he
never di&s;tributed his Favours but where he
thought him&s;elf both loved and faithfully &s;erved,
and when he was &s;o, even the &s;ingle Actions of
his private Soldiers he would take particular
Notice of him&s;elf, and publickly own, acknow|ledge
and reward them, of which I am obliged
to give &s;ome In&s;tances.</P>
<P>A private Mu&s;queteer at the &s;torming the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wurtzberg,</HI> when all the Detachment was
beaten off &s;tood in the Face of the Enemy, and fired
his Piece, and though he had 1000 &s;hot made at
him, &s;tood uuconcerned, and charged his Piece
again, and let fly at the Enemy, continuing to do
&s;o three Times, at the &s;ame Time beckoning with
his Hand to his Fellows to come on again, which
they did, animated by his Example, and carried
the place for the King.</P>
<P>When the Town was taken the King ordered
the Regiment to be drawn out, and calling for that
Soldier, thanked him before them all for taking the
Town for him, gave him 1000 Dollars in Money,
and a Commi&s;&s;ion with his own Hand for a Foot
Company, or Leave to go home, which he
would; the Soldier took the Commi&s;&s;ion on his
Knees, ki&s;&s;ed it, and put it into his Bo&s;om, and
told the King, he would never leave his Service
as long as he lived.</P>
<P>This Bounty of the King's, timed and &s;uited
by his Judgment, was the Rea&s;on that he was
very well &s;erved, intirely beloved, and mo&s;t
punctually obeyed by his Soldiers, who were &s;ure
to be cheri&s;hed and encouraged, if they did well,
having the King generally an Eye-witne&s;s of their
Behaviour.</P>
<P>My Indi&s;cretion rather than Valour had en|gaged
me &s;o far at the Battle of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> that be|ing
<PB N="86" REF="92">
in the Van of Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI>'s Brigade,
almo&s;t three whole Companies of us were &s;epa|rated
from our Line, and &s;urrounded by
the Enemies Pikes; I cannot but &s;ay al&s;o that
we were di&s;engaged rather by a de&s;perate Charge
Sir <HI>John</HI> made with the whole Regiment to fetch
us off, than by our own Valour, though we were
not wanting to our &s;elves neither, but this Part
of the Action being talked of very much to the
Advantage of the young <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Voluntier, and
po&s;&s;ibly more than I de&s;erved, was the Occa&s;ion
of all the Di&s;tinction the King u&s;ed me with ever
after.</P>
<P>I had by this Time Letters from my Father,
in which, though with &s;ome Reluctance, he left
me at Liberty to enter into Arms if I thought
fit, always obliging me to be directed, and, as
he &s;aid, commanded by Sir <HI>John Hepburn;</HI> at the
&s;ame Time he wrote to Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> com|mending
his Son's Fortunes, as he called it, to
his Care; which Letters Sir <HI>John</HI> &s;hewed the
King, unknown to me.</P>
<P>I took Care always to acquaint my Father
of every Circum&s;tance, and forgot not to men|tion
his Maje&s;ty's extraordinary Favour, which
&s;o affected my Father that he obtained a very
honourable mention of it in a Letter from King
<HI>Charles</HI> to the King of <HI>Swedon,</HI> written by his own
Hand.</P>
<P>I had waited on his Maje&s;ty with Sir <HI>John
Hepburn,</HI> to give him Thanks for his magnificent
Pre&s;ent, and was received with his u&s;ual Good|ne&s;s,
and after that I was every Day among the
Gentlemen of his ordinary Attendance; and if
his Maje&s;ty went out on a Party, as he would
often do, or to view the Country, I always at|tended
him among the Voluntiers of whom a great
<PB N="87" REF="93">
many always followed him; and he would often
call me out, talk with me, &s;end me upon Me&s;|&s;ages
to Towns, to Princes, free Cities, and the
like, upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Piece of Service he put me upon
had like to have embroiled me with one of his
favourite Collonels; the King was marching
through the <HI>Berg&s;tract,</HI> a low Country on the edge
of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and, as all Meri thought, was going
to be&s;iege <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> but on a &s;udden orders a
Party of his Guards, with five Companies of <HI>Scots,</HI>
to be drawn out; while they were drawing out
this Detachment the King calls me to him, Ho,
<HI>Cavalier,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that was his u&s;ual Word,</HI> you
&s;hall command this Party; and thereupon gives
me Orders to march back all Night, and in the
Morning, by break of Day, to take Po&s;t under
the Walls of the Fort of <HI>Oppenheim;</HI> and imme|diately
to entrench my &s;elf as well as I could:
<HI>Grave Neels,</HI> the Collo$el of his Guards, thought
him&s;elf injured by this Command, but the King
took the Matter upon him&s;elf, and <HI>Grave Neels</HI>
told me very familiarly afterwards, We have
&s;uch a Ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, that no Man can be af|fronted
by: I thought my &s;elf wronged, &s;ays he,
when you commanded my Men over my Head;
and for my Life, &s;ays he, I knew not which way
to be angry.</P>
<P>I executed my Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o punctually that
by break of Day I was &s;et down within Mu&s;|quet-&s;hot
of the Fort, under covert of a little
Mount, on which &s;tood a Wind-mill, and had in|differently
fortified my &s;elf, and at the &s;ame
Time had po&s;ted &s;ome of my Men on two other
Pa&s;&s;es, but at farther Di&s;tance from the Fort,
&s;o that the Fort was effectually block'd up on
the Land-&s;ide; in the Afternoon the Enemy &s;al|lied
<PB N="88" REF="94">
on my fir&s;t Entrenchment, but being covered
from their Cannon, and defended by a Ditch which
I had drawn cro&s;s the Road, they were &s;o well
received by my Mu&s;queteers that they retired
with the lo&s;s of 6 or 7 Men.</P>
<P>The next Day Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> was &s;ent with
two Brigades of Foot to carry on the Work, and
&s;o my Commi&s;&s;ion ended; the King expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf very well plea&s;ed with what I had done,
and when he was &s;o was never &s;paring of telling
of it, for he u&s;ed to &s;ay that publick Commendati|ons
were a great Encouragement to Valour.</P>
<P>While Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> lay before the Fort,
and was preparing to &s;torm it, the King's De&s;ign
was to get over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> which
where in <HI>Oppenheim</HI> had &s;unk all the Boats they
could find; at la&s;t the King being informed
where &s;ome lay that were &s;unk cau&s;ed them to
be weighed with all the Expedition po&s;&s;ible, and
in the Night of the 7th of <HI>December</HI> in three
Boats pa&s;&s;ed over his Regiment of Guards, about
three Miles above the Town, and as the King
thought &s;ecure from Danger; but they were
no &s;ooner landed and not drawn into Order but
they were charged by a Body of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e,
and had not the Darkne&s;s given them Opportu|nity
to draw up in the Enclo&s;ures in &s;everal
little Parties, they had been in great Danger of
being di&s;ordered, but by this Means they lined
the Hedges and Lanes &s;o with Mu&s;queteers, that
the remainder had Time to draw up in Battalia,
and &s;aluted the Hor&s;e with their Mu&s;quets &s;o that
they drew farther off.</P>
<P>The King was very impatient, hearing his Men
engaged, having no Boats nor po&s;&s;ible Means to
get over to help them; at la&s;t, about Eleven a
Clock at Night the Boats came back, and the
<PB N="89" REF="95">
King thru&s;t another Regiment into them, and
though his Officers di&s;&s;uaded him, would go over
him&s;elf with them on Foot, and did &s;o. This
was three Months that very Day when the Battle
of <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> was fought, and winter Time too, that
the Progre&s;s of his Arms had &s;pread from the
<HI>Elbe,</HI> where it parts <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> to
the <HI>Lower Palatinate</HI> and the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>I went over in the Boat with the King, I
never &s;aw him in &s;o much Concern in my Life,
for he was in Pain for his Men; but before we
got on &s;hore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> retired, however the
King landed, ordered his Men, and prepared to en|trench,
but he had not Time; for by that Time
the Boats were put off again, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
not knowing more Troops were landed, and
being reinforced from <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> came on again,
and charged with great Fury; but all Things
were now in Order; and they were readily
received and beaten back again: They came on
again the third Time, and with repeated Charges
attacked us; but at la&s;t finding us too &s;trong for
them they gave it over. By this Time another
Regiment of Foot was come over, and as &s;oon as
Day appeared the King with the three Regi|ments
marched to the Town, which &s;urrendred
at the fir&s;t Summons, and the next Day the Fort
yielded to Sir <HI>John Hepburn.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle at <HI>Oppenheim</HI> held out &s;till with a Garri|&s;on
of 800 <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the King leaving 200 <HI>Scots</HI>
of Sir <HI>James Ram&s;ey's</HI> Men in the Town, drew out
to attack the Ca&s;tle; Sir <HI>James Ram&s;ey</HI> being left
wounded at <HI>Wartsburgh</HI> the King gave me the
Command of tho&s;e 200 <HI>Men,</HI> which were a Regi|ment,
that is to &s;ay, all that were left of a Gallant
Regiment of 2000 <HI>Scots</HI> which the King brought
out of <HI>Sweden</HI> with him, under that Brave Collonel;
<PB N="90" REF="96">
there was about 30 Officers, who having no Sol|diers
were yet in Pay, and &s;erved as Reformadoes
with the Regiment, and were over and above the
200 Men.</P>
<P>The King de&s;igned to &s;torm the Ca&s;tle on the
lower &s;ide by the Way that leads to <HI>Mentz,</HI> and
Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> landed from the other Side and
marched up to &s;torm on the <HI>Rhine</HI> Port.</P>
<P>My Reformado <HI>Scots</HI> having ob&s;erved that the
Town Port of the Ca&s;tle was not &s;o well guarded
as the re&s;t, all the Eyes of the Garri&s;on being
bent towards the King and Sir <HI>John Hepburn;</HI> came
running to me, and told me, they believed they
could enter the Ca&s;tle Sword in Hand if
I would give them Leave; I told them I dur&s;t
not give them Orders, my Commi&s;&s;ion being
only to keep and defend the Town; but they
being very importunate, I told them they were
Voluntiers, and might do what they plea&s;ed,
that I would lend them 50 Men and draw up
the re&s;t to &s;econd them, or bring them off, as I
&s;aw Occa&s;ion, &s;o as I might not hazard the
Town; this was as much as they de&s;ired, they
&s;allied immediately, and in a trice the Voluntiers
&s;caled the Port, cut in Pieces the Guard and
bur&s;t open the Gate, at which the 50 entered:
finding the Gate won I advanced immediately
with 100 Mu&s;queteers more, having locked up
all the Gates of the Town but the Ca&s;tle-Port,
and leaving 50 &s;till for a Re&s;erve ju&s;t at that
Gate; the Town&s;men too &s;eeing the Ca&s;tle as it
were taken, run to Arms, and followed me with
above 200 Men; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were knocked down
by the <HI>Scots</HI> before they knew what the Matter
was, and the King and Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> advancing
to &s;torm, were &s;urprized, when in&s;tead of Re&s;i&s;t|ance,
they &s;aw the <HI>Spaniards</HI> throwing them&s;elves
<PB N="91" REF="97">
over the Walls to avoid the Fury of the <HI>Scots;</HI>
few of the Garri&s;on got away, but were either
killed or taken, and having cleared the Ca&s;tle,
I &s;et open the Port on the King's Side, and &s;ent
his Maje&s;ty Word the Ca&s;tle was his own. The
King came on, and entered on Foot, I received him
at the Head of the <HI>Scots</HI> Reformadoes, who all
&s;aluted him with their Pikes. The King gave
them his Hat, and turning about, <HI>Brave</HI> Scots, <HI>Brave</HI>
Scots, &s;ays he &s;miling, <HI>you were too quick for me;</HI>
then beckoning to me, made me tell him how and
in what Manner we had managed the Storm,
which he was exceeding well plea&s;ed with, but
e&s;pecially at the Caution I had u&s;ed to bring them
off if they had mi&s;carried, and &s;ecure the Town.</P>
<P>From hence the Army marched to <HI>Mentz,</HI>
which in 4 Days Time capitulated, with the Fort
and Citadel, and the City paid his Maje&s;ty
300000 Dollars to be exempted from the Fury
of the Soldiers; here the King him&s;elf drew the
Plan of tho&s;e invincible Fortifications which
to this Day makes it one of the &s;tronge&s;t Cities
in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friburg, Koning&s;tien, Niu&s;tat, Kei&s;er-Lautern,</HI> and
almo&s;t all the <HI>Lower Palatinate,</HI> &s;urrendered at
the very Terror of the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> Approach,
and never &s;uffered the Danger of a Siege.</P>
<P>The King held a mo&s;t Magnificent Court at
<HI>Mentz,</HI> attended by the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI>
with an incredible Number of Princes and
Lords of the Empire, with Amba&s;&s;adors and
Re&s;idents of Foreign Princes; and here his
Maje&s;ty &s;taid till <HI>March</HI> when the Queen,
with a great Retinue of <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Nobility came
from <HI>Erfurt</HI> to &s;ee him. The King attended by
a gallant Train of <HI>German</HI> Nobility went to
<PB N="92" REF="98">
<HI>Frankfort,</HI> and from thence on to <HI>Hoe&s;t,</HI> to meet
the Queen, where her Maje&s;ty arrived <HI>Feb.</HI> 8th.</P>
<P>During the King's &s;tay in the&s;e Parts, his
Armies were not idle, his Troops on one &s;ide
under the <HI>Rhinegrave,</HI> a brave and ever-fortunate
Commander, and under the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI>
on the other, ranged the Country from <HI>Lorrain</HI>
to <HI>Luxeniburgh,</HI> and pa&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;elle</HI> on the
We&s;t, and the <HI>We&s;er</HI> on the North. Nothing could
&s;tand before them, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army which came
to the Relief of the Catholick Electors was every
where defeated and beaten quite out of the Coun|try,
and the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Army quite ruined; 'twas
a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Court &s;ure as ever was &s;een,
where every Day Expre&s;&s;es arrived of Armies
defeated, Towns &s;urrendered, Contributions a|greed
upon, Parties routed, Pri&s;oners taken, and
Princes &s;ending Amba&s;&s;adours to &s;ue for Truces
and Neutralities, to make Submi&s;&s;ions and Com|po&s;itions,
and to pay Arrears and Contri|butions.</P>
<P>Here arrived, <HI>Febr.</HI> 10th, the King of <HI>Bohe|mia</HI>
from <HI>England,</HI> and with him my Lord <HI>Craven,</HI>
with a Body of <HI>Dutch Hor&s;e,</HI> and a very fine
Train of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Voluntiers, who immediately,
without any &s;tay, marched on to <HI>Hoe&s;t</HI> to wait
upon his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who received him
with a great deal of Civility, and was treated
at a Noble Collation, by the King and Queen,
at <HI>Frankfort.</HI> Never had the Unfortunate King
&s;o fair a Pro&s;pect of being re&s;tored to his Inhe|ritance
of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> as at that Time, and had
King <HI>James,</HI> his Father-in-Law, had a Soul an|&s;werable
to the Occa&s;ion, it had been effected be|fore,
but it was a &s;trange Thing to &s;ee him equip|ped
from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court with one Lord and
about 40 or 50 <HI>Engli&s;h Gentlemen</HI> in his Attend|ance,
<PB N="93" REF="99">
whereas had the King of <HI>England</HI> now, as
'tis well known he might have done, furni&s;hed
him with 10 or 12000 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot, nothing
could have hindered him taking a full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his Country; and yet even without that Help
did the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> clear almo&s;t his whole
Country of <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> and after his Death rein|&s;tal
his Son in the Electorate, but no Thanks
to us.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Craven</HI> did me the Honour to en|quire
for me by Name, and his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Sweden</HI>
did me yet more by pre&s;enting me to the King
of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Craven</HI> gave me a Let|ter
from my Father, and &s;peaking &s;omething of
my Father having &s;erved under the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> in the Famous Battle of <HI>Neuport,</HI> the King
&s;miling returned, <HI>And pray tell him from me his Son
has &s;erved as well in the warm Battle of</HI> Leip&s;ick.</P>
<P>My Father being very much plea&s;ed with the
Honour I had received from &s;o great a King, had
ordered me to acquaint his Maje&s;ty, that if he
plea&s;ed to accept of their Service he would rai&s;e
him a Regiment of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e at his own
Charge to be under my Command, and to be &s;ent
over into <HI>Holland;</HI> and my Lord <HI>Craven</HI> had
Orders from the King of <HI>England</HI> to &s;ignify
his Con&s;ent to the &s;aid Levy. I acquainted my
old Friend Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> with the Contents
of the Letter, in order to have his Advice, who
being plea&s;ed with the Propo&s;al, would have me
go to the King immediately with the Letter, but
pre&s;ent Service put it off for &s;ome Days.</P>
<P>The taking of <HI>Creutznach</HI> was the next Service
of any Moment; the King drew out in Per&s;on to
the Siege of this Town; the Town &s;oon came to a
Parly, but the Ca&s;tle &s;eemed a Work of Difficulty;
for its Situation was &s;o &s;trong and &s;o &s;urrounded
<PB N="94" REF="100">
with Works behind and above one another, that
mo&s;t People thought the King would receive a
Check from it; but it was not ea&s;y to re&s;i&s;t the
Re&s;olution of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>He never battered it but with two &s;mall Pieces,
but having viewed the Works him&s;elf, ordered
a Mine under the fir&s;t Ravelin, which being &s;prung
with Succe&s;s, he commands a &s;torm; I think there
was not more commanded Men than Voluntiers,
both <HI>Engli&s;h, Scots, French</HI> and <HI>Germans:</HI> My old
Comrade was by this Time recovered of his
Wound at <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> and made one. The fir&s;t Body
of Voluntiers of about 40, were led on by my Lord
<HI>Craven,</HI> and I led the &s;econd, among whom were
mo&s;t of the Reformade <HI>Scots</HI> Officers who
took the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Oppenheim;</HI> the fir&s;t Party was
not able to make any Thing of it, the Garri&s;on
fought with &s;o much Fury that many of the
Voluntier Gentlemen being wounded, and &s;ome
killed, the re&s;t were beaten off with Lo&s;s. The
King was in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion at his Men, and rated
them for running away, as he called it, though
they really retreated in good Order, and com|manded
the A&s;&s;ault to be renewed. 'Twas our
Turn to fall on next; our <HI>Scots</HI> Officers not being
u&s;ed to be beaten, advanced immediately, and my
Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> with his Voluntiers, pierced in with
us, fighting gallantly in the Breach with a Pike
in his Hand, and to give him the Honour due to
his Bravery, he was with the fir&s;t on the Top of
the Rampart, and gave his Hand to my Comrade,
and lifted him up after him; we helped one
another up, till at la&s;t almo&s;t all the Voluntiers
had gained the Height of the Ravelin, and main|tained
it with a great Deal of Re&s;olution, expect|ing
when the commanded Men had gained the
&s;ame Height to advance upon the Enemy, when
<PB N="95" REF="101">
one of the Enemies Captains called to my Lord
<HI>Craven,</HI> and told him if they might have honoura|ble
Terms they would capitulate, which my
Lord telling him he would engage for, the Gar|ri&s;on
fired no more, and the Captain leaping
down from the next Rampart came with my
Lord <HI>Craven</HI> into the Camp, where the Conditions
were agreed on, and the Ca&s;tle &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>After the taking of this Town, the King hear|ing
of <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Approach, and how he had beaten
<HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn,</HI> the King's Field Mar&s;hal out of

<P>I had taken an Opportunity to wait upon his
Maje&s;ty with Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> and being about to
introduce the Di&s;cour&s;e of my Father's Letter,
the King told me he had received a Compliment
on my account in a Letter from King <HI>Charles:</HI> I
told him his Maje&s;ty had by his exceeding Gene|ro&s;ity
bound me and all my Friends to pay their
Acknowledgments to him, and that I &s;uppo&s;ed
my Father had obtained &s;uch a mention of it
from the King of <HI>England</HI> as Gratitude moved
him to; that his Maje&s;ty's Favour had been
&s;hewn in me to a Family both willing and ready
to &s;erve him, that I had received &s;ome Commands
from my Father, which if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed
to do me the Honour to accept of, might put
me in a Condition to acknowledge his Maje&s;ty's
Goodne&s;s in a Manner more proportioned to the
Sen&s;e I had of his Favour; and with that I pro|duced
my Father's Letter, and read that Clau&s;e
in it which related the Regiment of Hor&s;e,
which was as follows.</P>

is a very &s;trong Place and well fortified, and
yet &s;uch Expedition did the King make, and
&s;uch Re&s;olution did he u&s;e in his fir&s;t Attacks,
that he carried the Town without putting him|&s;elf
to the Trouble of formal Approaches; 'twas
generally his way when he came before any
Town with a De&s;ign to be&s;iege it; he never would
encamp at a Di&s;tance and begin his Trenches a
great Way off, but bring his Men immediately
<PB N="99" REF="105">
within half Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the Place, there
getting under the be&s;t Cover he could, he would
immediately begin his Batteries and Trenches
before their Faces; and if there was any Place
po&s;&s;ible to be attacked, he would fall to &s;torm|ing
immediately: By this re&s;olute way of coming
on he carried many a Town in the fir&s;t heat of
his Men, which would have held out many Days
again&s;t a more Regular Siege.</P>
<P>This March of the King broke all <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Mea|&s;ures,
for now was he obliged to face about, and
leaving the <HI>&V;pper Palatinate,</HI> to come to the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> for the King be|ing
20000 &s;trong, be&s;ides 10000 Foot and 4000
Hor&s;e and Dragoons which joined him from
the <HI>Duringer Wald,</HI> was re&s;olved to ruin the Duke,
who lay now open to him, and was the mo&s;t
powerful and inveterate Enemy of the Prote|&s;tants
in the Empire.</P>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> was now joined with the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
and might together make about 22000 Men, and
in Order to keep the <HI>Swedes</HI> out of the Country
of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> had planted them&s;elves along the
Banks of the River <HI>Lech,</HI> which runs on the Edge
of the Duke's Territories; and having fortified
the other Side of the River, and planted his Can|non
for &s;everal Miles at all the convenient Pla|ces
on the River, re&s;olved to di&s;pute the King's
Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be the longer in relating this Account
of the <HI>Lech,</HI> being e&s;teemed in tho&s;e Days as great
an Action as any Battle or Siege of that Age,
and particularly famous for the Di&s;a&s;ter of the
gallant old General <HI>Tilly;</HI> and for that I can be
more particular in it than other Accounts, hav|ing
been an Eye-witne&s;s to every part of it.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106">
The King being truly informed of the Di&s;|po&s;ition
of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Army, was once of the
Mind to have left the Banks of the <HI>Lech,</HI> have
repa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube,</HI> and &s;o &s;etting down before
<HI>Ingol&s;tat,</HI> the Duke's Capital City, by the taking
that &s;trong Town to have made his Entrance
into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Conque&s;t of &s;uch a Fortre&s;s,
one entire Action; but the Strength of the Place,
and the Difficulty of maintaining his Leaguer in
an Enemy's Country, while <HI>Tilly</HI> was &s;o &s;trong
in the Field, diverted him from that De&s;ign; he
therefore concluded that <HI>Tilly</HI> was fir&s;t to be
beaten out of the Country, and then the Siege
of <HI>Ingol&s;tat</HI> would be the ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>Whereupon the King re&s;olved to go and view
the Situation of the Enemy; his Maje&s;ty went
out the 2d of <HI>April</HI> with a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e,
which I had the Honour to command; we march|ed
as near as we could to the Banks of the River,
not to be too much expo&s;ed to the Enemy's
Cannon, and having gained a little Height,
where the whole Cour&s;e of the River might be
&s;een, the King halted, and Commanded to draw
up. The King alighted, and calling me to him,
Examined every Reach and Turning of the River
by his Gla&s;s, but finding the River run a long
and almo&s;t a &s;traight Cour&s;e, he could find no
Place which he liked, but at la&s;t turning him&s;elf
North, and looking down the &s;tream, he found
the River fetching a long Reach, doubles &s;hort
upon it &s;elf, making a round and very narrow
Point, <HI>There's a Point will do our bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> &s;ays the
King, <HI>and if the Ground be good I'll pa&s;s there, let</HI> Tilly
<HI>do his wor&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>He immediately ordered a &s;mall Party of
Hor&s;e to view the Ground, and to bring him
<PB N="101" REF="107">
Word particularly how high the Bank was on
each Side and at the Point; and he &s;hall have
50 Dollars, &s;ays the King, that will bring me
Word how deep the Water is. I asked his Maje&s;ty
Leave to let me go, which he would by no
Means allow of; but as the Party was drawing
out, a Serjeant of Dragoons told the King, if he
plea&s;ed to let him go di&s;gui&s;ed as a Boor, he
would bring him an Account of every Thing he
de&s;ired. The King liked the Motion well e|nough,
and the Fellow being very well acquaint|ed
with the Country, puts on a Ploughman's
Habit, and went away immediately with a long
Pole upon his Shoulder; the Hor&s;e lay all this
while in the Woods, and the King &s;tood undi&s;|cerned
by the Enemy on the little Hill afore|&s;aid.
The Dragoon with his long Pole comes
down boldly to the Bank of the River, and cal|ling
to the Centinels which <HI>Tilly</HI> had placed on
the other Bank, talked with them, asked them,
if they could not help him over the River, and
pretended he wanted to come to them; at la&s;t
being come to the Point, where, as I &s;aid, the
River makes a &s;hort Turn, he &s;tands parlying
with them a great while, and &s;ometimes pretend|ing
to wade over, he puts his long Pole into the
Water, then finding it pretty Shallow he pulls
off his Ho&s;e and goes in, &s;till thru&s;ting his Pole in
before him, till being gotten up to his middle,
he could reach beyond him, where it was too
deep, and &s;o &s;haking his Head, comes back again.
The Soldiers on the other Side laughing at him,
asked him if he could &s;wim? He &s;aid, No. Why
you Fool you, &s;ays one of the Centinels, the
Channel of the River is 20 Foot deep. How
do you know that? &s;ays the Dragoon. Why our
<PB N="102" REF="108">
Engineer, &s;ays he, mea&s;ured it Ye&s;terday. This
was what he wanted, but not yet fully &s;atisfied;
Ay but, &s;ays he, may be it may not be very
broad, and if one of you would wade in to meet
me till I could reach you with my Pole, I'd give
him half a Ducat to pull me over. The innocent
way of his Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o deluded the Soldiers,
that one of them immediately &s;trips and goes in
up to the Shoulders, and our Dragoon goes in on
this Side to meet him; but the Stream took the
t'other Soldier away, and he being a good Swim|mer,
came &s;wimming over to this Side. The
Dragoon was then in a great deal of Pain for fear
of being di&s;covered, and was once going to kill
the Fellow, and make off; but at la&s;t re&s;olved
to carry on the Humour, and having enter|tained
the Fellow with a Tale of a Tub, about
the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;tealing his Oats, the Fellow being a
cold wanted to be gone, and he as willing to be
rid of him, pretended to be very &s;orry he could
not get over the River, and &s;o makes off.</P>
<P>By this however he learned both the Depth and
Breadth of the Channel, the Bottom and Nature of
both Shores, and every Thing the King wanted to
know; we could &s;ee him from the Hill by our
Gla&s;&s;es very plain, and could &s;ee the Soldier na|ked
with him: Says the King, he will certainly
be di&s;covered and knocked on the Head from
the other Side: He is a Fool, &s;ays the King, he
does not kill the Fellow and run off; but when
the Dragoon told his Tale, the King was ex|tremely
well &s;atisfied with him, gave him 100
Dollars, and made him a Quarter-ma&s;ter to a
Troop of Cuira&s;&s;iers.</P>
<P>The King having farther examined the Dra|goon,
he gave him a very di&s;tinct Account of
<PB N="103" REF="109">
the Shore and the Ground on this Side, which
he found to be higher than the Enemy's by 10
or 12 Foot, and a hard Gravel.</P>
<P>Hereupon the King re&s;olves to pa&s;s there, and
in order to it gives, him&s;elf, particular Directi|ons
for &s;uch a Bridge as I believe never Army
pa&s;&s;ed a River on before nor &s;ince.</P>
<P>His Bridge was only loo&s;e Plank laid upon
large Tre&s;&s;els in the &s;ame homely Manner as I
have &s;een Bricklayers rai&s;e a low Scaffold to
build a Brick Wall; the Tre&s;&s;els were made
higher than one another to an&s;wer to the River
as it become deeper or &s;hallower, and was all
framed and fitted before any Appearance was
made of attempting to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>When all was ready the King brings his Army
down to the Bank of the River, and plants his
Cannon as the Enemy had done, &s;ome here and
&s;ome there, to amu&s;e them.</P>
<P>At Night <HI>April</HI> 4th, the King commanded
about 2000 Men to march to the Point, and to
throw up a Trench on either Side, and quite
round it with a Battery of &s;ix Pieces of Cannon,
at each End be&s;ides three &s;mall Mounts, one at
the Point and one of each Side, which had each
of them two Pieces upon them. This Work was
begun &s;o briskly, and &s;o well carried on, the King
firing all the Night from the other Parts of the
River, that by Day-light all the Batteries at the
new Work were mounted, the Trench lined with
2000 Mu&s;queteers, and all the Uten&s;ils of the
Bridge lay ready to be put together.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> di&s;covered the De&s;ign, but
it was too late to hinder it, the Mu&s;queteers in
the great Trench, and the five new Batteries,
made &s;uch continual Fire that the other Bank,
which, as before, lay 12 Foot below them, was too
<PB N="104" REF="110">
hot for the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts;</HI> whereupon <HI>Tilly,</HI> to be
provided for the King at his coming over, falls
to work in a Wood right again&s;t the Point, and
rai&s;es a great Battery for 20 Pieces of Cannon,
with a Brea&s;t-Work, or Line, as near the River
as he could, to cover his Men, thinking that
when the King had built his Bridge he might
ea&s;ily beat it down with his Cannon.</P>
<P>But the King had doubly prevented him, fir&s;t
by laying his Bridge &s;o low that none of <HI>Tilly</HI>'s
Shot could hurt it; for the Bridge lay not above
half a Foot above the Water's edge, by which
Means the King, who in that &s;hewed him&s;elf an
excellent Engineer, had &s;ecured it from any
Batteries to be made within the Land, and the
Angle of the Bank &s;ecured it from the remoter Bat|teries,
on the other Side, and the continual Fire
of the Cannon and &s;mall Shot beat the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI>
from their &s;tation ju&s;t again&s;t it, they having no
Works to cover them.</P>
<P>And in the &s;econd Place, to &s;ecure his Pa&s;&s;age
he &s;ent over about 200 Men, and after that 200
more, who had Orders to ca&s;t up a large Ravelin
on the other Bank, ju&s;t where he de&s;igned to
land his Bridge; this was done with &s;uch Ex|pedition
too, that it was fini&s;hed before Night,
and in a Condition to receive all the Shot of
<HI>Tilly</HI>'s great Battery, and effectually covered his
Bridge. While this was doing the King on his
Side lays over his Bridge. Both Sides wrought
hard all Day and all Night, as if the Spade,
not the Sword, had been to decide the Contro|ver&s;y,
and that he had got the Victory who&s;e
Trenches and Batteries were fir&s;t ready; in the
mean while the Cannon and Mu&s;quet Bullets
flew like Hail, and made the Service &s;o hot,
that both Sides had enough to do to make their
<PB N="105" REF="111">
Men &s;tand to their Work; the King in the
hotte&s;t of it, animated his Men by his Pre&s;ence,
and <HI>Tilly,</HI> to give him his Due, did the &s;ame;
for the Execution was &s;o great, and &s;o many Offi|cers
killed, General <HI>Attringer</HI> wounded, and two
Sergeant Majors killed, that at la&s;t <HI>Tilly</HI> him&s;elf
was obliged to expo&s;e him&s;elf, and to come up
to the very Face of our Line to encourage his
Men, and give his nece&s;&s;ary Orders.</P>
<P>And here about one a Clock, much about the
Time that the King's Bridge and Works were
fini&s;hed, and ju&s;t as they &s;aid he had ordered to
fall on upon our Ravelin with 3000 Foot, was
the Brave old <HI>Tilly</HI> &s;lain with a Mu&s;quet Bullet
in the Thigh; he was carried off to <HI>Ingol&s;tat,</HI>
and lived &s;ome Days after, but died of that
Wound the &s;ame Day as the King had his Hor&s;e
&s;hot under him at the Siege of that Town.</P>
<P>We made no que&s;tion of paffing the River here,
having brought every Thing &s;o forward, and
with &s;uch extraordinary Succe&s;s, but we &s;hould
have found it a very hot Piece of Work if <HI>Tilly</HI>
had lived one Day more; and if I may give my
Opinion of it, having &s;een <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Battery and
Brea&s;t-work, in the Face of which we mu&s;t have
pa&s;&s;ed the River, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that whenever we
had marched, if <HI>Tilly</HI> had fallen in with his Hor&s;e
and Foot, placed in that Trench, the whole
Army would have pa&s;&s;ed as much Danger <HI>as in
the Face of a &s;trong Town in the &s;torming a Counter&s;carp.</HI>
The King him&s;elf, when he &s;aw with what
Judgment <HI>Tilly</HI> had prepared his Works, and
what Danger he mu&s;t have run, would often &s;ay,
that Day's Succe&s;s was every way equal to the
Victory of <HI>Leip&s;ick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> being hurt and carried off, as if the Soul
of the Army had been lo&s;t, they begun to draw
<PB N="106" REF="112">
off; the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> took Hor&s;e and rid
away as if he had fled out of Battle for his
Life.</P>
<P>The other Generals, with a little more Cau|tion,
as well as Courage, drew off by Degrees,
&s;ending their Cannon and Baggage away fir&s;t,
and leaving &s;ome to continue firing on the Bank
of the River to conceal their Retreat; the River
preventing any Intelligence, we knew nothing of
the Di&s;a&s;ter befallen them; and the King, who
looked for Blows, having fini&s;hed his Bridge and
Ravelin, ordered to run a Line with Pali&s;adoes
to take in more Ground on the Bank of the River,
to cover the fir&s;t Troops he &s;hould &s;end over:
This being fini&s;hed the &s;ame Night, the King
&s;ends over a Party of his Guards to relieve the
Men who were in the Ravelin, and commanded
600 Mu&s;queteers to Man the new line out of
the <HI>Scots</HI> Brigade.</P>
<P>Early in the Morning a &s;mall Party of <HI>Scots,</HI>
commanded by one Captain <HI>Forbes,</HI> of my Lord
<HI>Reas</HI> Regiment, were &s;ent out to learn &s;omething
of the Enemy, the King ob&s;erving they had not
fired all Night; and while this Party were abroad,
the Army &s;tood in Battalia; and my old Friend
Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> whom of all Men the King
mo&s;t depended upon for any de&s;perate Service,
was ordered to pa&s;s the Bridge with his Brigade,
and to draw up without the Line, with Com|mand
to advance as he found the Hor&s;e who
were to &s;econd him came over</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> being pa&s;&s;ed without the Trench,
meets Captain <HI>Forbes</HI> with &s;ome Pri&s;oners, and
the good News of the Enemy's Retreat; he &s;ends
him directly to the King, who was by this Time
at the Head of his Army, in full Battalia ready
to follow his Vanguard, expecting a hot Day's
<PB N="107" REF="113">
Work of it. Sir <HI>John</HI> &s;ends Me&s;&s;enger after Me&s;|&s;enger
to the King, intreating him to give him
Orders to advance; but the King would not &s;uf|fer
him; for he was ever upon his Guard, and
would not venture a Surprize; &s;o the Army
continued on this Side the <HI>Lech</HI> all Day, and the
next Night. In the Morning the King &s;ent for
me, and ordered me to draw out 300 Hor&s;e, and
a Collonel with 600 Hor&s;e, and a Collonel with
800 Dragoons, and ordered us to enter the Wood
by 3 Ways, but &s;o as to be able to relieve one
another; and then ordered Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> with
his Brigade to advance to the edge of the Wood
to &s;ecure our Retreat; and at the &s;ame Time com|manded
another Brigade of Foot to pa&s;s the
Bridge, if need were, to &s;econd Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI>
&s;o warily did this prudent General proceed.</P>
<P>We advanced with our Hor&s;e into the <HI>Bavarian</HI>
Camp, which we found for&s;aken; the plunder
of it was incon&s;iderable, for the exceeding Cau|tion
the King had u&s;ed gave them Time to carry
off all their Baggage; we followed them three or
four Miles and returned to our Camp.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was mo&s;t diverted that Day with
viewing the Works which <HI>Tilly</HI> had ca&s;t up, and
mu&s;t own again, that had he not been taken
off, we had met with as de&s;perate a Piece of
Work as ever was attempted. The next Day the
re&s;t of the Cavalry came up to us, commanded
by <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn,</HI> and the King and the whole
Army followed; we advanced through the Heart
of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> took <HI>Rain</HI> at the fir&s;t Summons, and
&s;everal other &s;mall Towns, and &s;at down before
<HI>Ausburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ausburg,</HI> though a Prote&s;tant City, had a po|pi&s;h
<HI>Bavarian</HI> Garri&s;on in it of above 5000 Men,
commanded by a <HI>Fugger</HI> a great Family in <HI>Ba|varia.</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="114">
The Governour had po&s;ted &s;everal little
Parties as out Scouts at the Di&s;tance of two Miles
and half, or three Miles from the Town. The
King, at his coming up to this Town, &s;ends me
with my little Troop, and 3 Companies of Dra|goons
to beat in the&s;e out Scouts; the fir&s;t Party
I light on was not above 16 Men, who had made a
&s;mall Barricado cro&s;s the Road, and &s;tood re&s;o|lutely
upon their Guard; I commanded the Dra|goons
to alight, and open the Barricado, which
while they re&s;olutely performed, the 16 Men
gave them 2 Volleys of their Mu&s;quets, and
through the Enclo&s;ures made their Retreat to
a Turn-pike about a quarter of a Mile farther.
We pa&s;t their fir&s;t Traver&s;e, and coming up to
the Turn-pike, I found it defended by 200 Mu&s;|queteers:
I prepared to attack them, &s;ending
word to the King how &s;trong the Enemy was,
and de&s;ired &s;ome Foot to be &s;ent me. My Dra|goons
fell on, and tho' the Enemy made a very hot
Fire, had beat them from this Po&s;t before 200
Foot, which the King had &s;ent me, had come up;
being joined with the Foot, I followed the Ene|my,
who retreated fighting, till they came under
the Cannon of a &s;trong Redoubt, where they drew
up, and I could &s;ee another Body of Foot of about
300 join them out of the Works; upon which
I halted, and con&s;idering I was in View of the
Town, and a great way from the Army, I faced
about and began to march off; as we marched I
found the Enemy followed, but kept at a Di|&s;tance,
as if they only de&s;igned to ob&s;erve me; I
had not marched far, but I heard a Volly of &s;mall
Shot, an&s;wered by 2 or 3 more, which I pre&s;ently
apprehended to be at the Turn-pike, where I
had left a &s;mall Guard of 26 Men, with a Lieu|tenant.
Immediately I detached 100 Dragoons
<PB N="109" REF="115">
to relieve my Men, and &s;ecure my Retreat, fol|lowing
my &s;elf as fa&s;t as the Foot could march. The
Lieutenant &s;ent me back word the Po&s;t was
taken by the Enemy, and my Men cut off; upon this
I doubled my Pace, and when I came up I found
it as the Lieutenant &s;aid; for the Po&s;t was taken
and manned with 300 Mu&s;queteers, and three
Troops of Hor&s;e; by this Time al&s;o I found the
Party in my Rear made up towards me, &s;o that
I was like to be charged in a narrow Place, both
in Front and Rear.</P>
<P>I &s;aw there was no Remedy but with all my
Force to fall upon that Party before me, and
&s;o to break through before tho&s;e from the Town
could come up with me; wherefore commanding
my Dragoons to alight, I ordered them to fall
on upon the Foot; their Hor&s;e were drawn up in
an enclo&s;ed Field on one Side of the Road, a
great Ditch &s;ecuring the other Side, &s;o that they
thought if I charged the Foot in Front they
would fall upon my Flank, while tho&s;e behind
would charge my Rear; and indeed had the other
come in Time, they had cut me off; my Dra|goons
made three fair Charges on their Foot, but
were received with &s;o much Re&s;olution, and &s;o
brisk a Fire that they were beaten off, and
&s;ixteen Men killed: Seeing them &s;o rudely
handled, and the Hor&s;e ready to fall in, I
relieved them with 100 Mu&s;queteers and
they renewed the Attack, at the &s;ame Time
with my Troop of Hor&s;e, flanked on both Wings
with 50 Mu&s;queteers, I faced their Hor&s;e, but
did not offer to charge them; the Ca&s;e grew
now de&s;perate, and the Enemy behind were ju&s;t
at my Heels with near 600 Men; the Captain who
commanded the Mu&s;queteers who flanked my
Hor&s;e came up to me, &s;ays he, if we do not force
<PB N="110" REF="116">
this Pa&s;s all will be lo&s;t; if you will draw out your
Troop and 20 of my Foot, and fall in, I'll engage
to keep off the Hor&s;e with the re&s;t. With all
my Heart, &s;ays I.</P>
<P>Immediately I wheel'd off my Troop, and a
&s;mall Party of the Mu&s;queteers followed me, and
fell in with the Dragoons and Foot, who
&s;eeing the Danger too, as well as I, fought like
Mad Men; the Foot at the Turn-pike were not
able to hinder our Breaking through, &s;o we made
our way out, killing about 150 of them, and put
the re&s;t into Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But now was I in as great a Difficulty as before
how to fetch off my brave Captain of Foot, for
they charged home upon him; he defended him|&s;elf
with extraordinary Gallantry, having the
Benefit of a Piece of a Hedge to cover him; but
he lo&s;t half his Men, and was ju&s;t upon the
Point of being defeated, when the King, informed
by a Soldier that e&s;caped from the Turn-pike,
one of 26, had &s;ent a Party of 600 Dragoons to
bring me off; the&s;e came upon the Spur, and
joined with me ju&s;t as I had broke through the
Turn-pike; the Enemy's Foot rallied behind
their Hor&s;e, and by this Time their other Party
was come in, but &s;eeing our Relief they drew off
together.</P>
<P>I lo&s;t above 100 Men in the&s;e Skirmi&s;hes, and
kill'd them about 180; we &s;ecured the Turn-pike,
and placed a Company of Foot there with 100
Dragoons, and came back well beaten to the
Army. The King, to prevent &s;uch uncertain
Skirmi&s;hes, advanced the next Day in View of the
Town, and according to his Cu&s;tom, &s;its down
with his whole Army within Cannon-&s;hot of
their Walls.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="117">
The King won this great City by Force of
Words, for by two or three Me&s;&s;ages and Letters
to and from the Citizens, the Town was gained,
the Garri&s;on not daring to defend them again&s;t
their Wills. His Maje&s;ty made his publick En|trance
into the City on the 14th of <HI>April,</HI> and
receiving the Compliments of the Citizens, ad|vanced
immediately to <HI>Ingol&s;tat,</HI> which is accoun|ted,
and really is the &s;tronge&s;t Town in all the&s;e
Parts.</P>
<P>The Town had a very &s;trong Garri&s;on in it,
and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> lay entrenched with his
Army under the Walls of it, on the other Side of
the River. The King, who never loved long
Sieges, having viewed the Town, and brought
his Army within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of it, called a
Council of War, where it was the King's Opi|nion,
in &s;hort, that the Town would lo&s;e him
more than 'twas worth, and therefore he re|&s;olved
to rai&s;e his Siege.</P>
<P>Here the King going to view the Town had
his Hor&s;e &s;hot with a Cannon-bullet from the
Works, which tumbled the King and his Hor&s;e
over one another, that every Body thought he
had been killed, but he received no Hurt at all;
that very Minute, as near as could be learnt, Ge|neral
<HI>Tilly</HI> died in the Town of the Shot he re|ceived
on the Bank of the <HI>Lech</HI> as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>I was not in the Camp when the King was
hurt, for the King had &s;ent almo&s;t all the Hor&s;e
and Dragoons, under <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn,</HI> to face the
Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Camp, and after that to plun|der
the Country, which truly was a Work the
Soldiers were very glad of, for it was very &s;el|dom
they had that Liberty given them, and
they made very good u&s;e of it when it was; for
the Country of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was rich and plentiful,
<PB N="112" REF="118">
having &s;een no Enemy before during the whole
War.</P>
<P>The Army having left the Siege of <HI>Ingol&s;tat,</HI>
proceeds to take in the re&s;t of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> Sir <HI>John
Hepburn</HI> with 3 Brigades of Foot, and <HI>Gu&s;tavus
Horn</HI> with 3000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, went to
the <HI>Land&s;hut,</HI> and took it the &s;ame Day; the
Garri&s;on was all Hor&s;e, and gave us &s;everal Ca|mi&s;adoes
at our Approach, in one of which I lo&s;t
two of my Troops, but when we had beat them
into col&s;e Quarters, they pre&s;ently capitulated.
The General got a great Sum of Money of the
Town befides a great many Pre&s;ents to the Offi|cers:
And from thence the King went on to
<HI>Munick,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Court; &s;ome of
the General Officers would fain have had the
plundering of the Duke's Palace; but the King
was too generous, the City paid him 400000
Dollars; and the Duke's Magazine was there
&s;eized, in which was 140 Pieces of Cannon, and
&s;mall Arms for above 20000 Men. The great
Chamber of the Duke's Rarities was pre&s;erved
by the Kings &s;pecial Order with a great deal of
Care. I expected to have &s;taid here &s;ome Time,
and to have taken a very exact Account of this
curious Labaratory; but being commanded away,
I had no Time, and the Fate of the War never
gave me Opportunity to &s;ee it again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> under the Command of Comi&s;|&s;ary
<HI>O&s;ta</HI> had be&s;ieged <HI>Bibrach,</HI> an Imperial
City not very well fortified, and the Inhabitants
being under the <HI>Swede</HI>'s Protection, defended
them&s;elves as well as they could, but were in
great Danger, and &s;ent &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es to the
King for Help.</P>
<P>The King immediately detaches a &s;trong Body
of Hor&s;e and Foot, to relieve <HI>Bibrach,</HI> and would
<PB N="113" REF="119">
be the Commander him&s;elf; I marched among
the Hor&s;e, but the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> &s;aved us the La|bour;
for the News of the King's coming fright|ed
away <HI>O&s;ta,</HI> that he left <HI>Bibrach,</HI> and hardly
looked behind him 'till he got up to the <HI>Boden&s;ee,</HI>
on the Confines of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland.</HI></P>
<P>At our Return from this Expedition, the King
had the fir&s;t News of <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI>'s Approach, who
on the Death of Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> being declared Ge|nerali&s;&s;imo
of the Emperor's Forces, had plaid
the Tyrant in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and was now advancing
with 60000 Men, as they reported, to relieve
the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>The King therefore, in order to be in a Po&s;ture
to receive this great General, re&s;olves to quit <HI>Ba|varia,</HI>
and to expect him on the Frontiers of <HI>Fran|conia;</HI>
and becau&s;e he knew the <HI>Norembergers,</HI> for
their Kindne&s;s to him, would be the fir&s;t Sacri|fice,
he re&s;olved to defend that City again&s;t him
whatever it co&s;t.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he did not leave <HI>Bavaria</HI> without
a Defence; but on the one Hand he left Sir <HI>John
Bannier</HI> with 10000 Men about <HI>Ausburgh,</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Saxe-Weymar</HI> with another like Army
about <HI>&V;lme</HI> and <HI>Meningen,</HI> with Orders &s;o to direct
their March, as that they might join him upon
any Occa&s;ion in a few Days.</P>
<P>We encamped about <HI>Noremberg</HI> the Middle of
<HI>June.</HI> The Army, after &s;o many Detachments, was
not above 19000 Men. The Imperial Army joined
with the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> were not &s;o numerous as was
reported, but were really 60000 Men. The
King, not &s;trong enough to fight yet, as he u&s;ed
to &s;ay, was &s;trong enough not to be forced to
to fight, formed his Camp &s;o under the Cannon
of <HI>Noremberg,</HI> that there was no be&s;ieging the
<PB N="114" REF="120">
Town, but they mu&s;t be&s;iege him too; and he
fortified his Camp in &s;o formidable a Manner,
that <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> never dur&s;t attack him. On the
30th of <HI>June, Walle&s;tein</HI>'s Troops appeared, and on
the 5th of <HI>July,</HI> encamped clo&s;e by the King, and
po&s;ted them&s;elves not on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Side, but
between the King and his own Friends of <HI>Schwa|ben,</HI>
and <HI>Frankenland</HI> in order to intercept his
Provi&s;ions, and, as they thought, to &s;tarve him out
of his Camp.</P>
<P>Here they lay to &s;ee, as it were, who could
&s;ub&s;i&s;t longe&s;t; the King was &s;trong in Hor&s;e, for
we had full 8000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons in the
Army, and this gave us great Advantage in the
&s;everal Skirmi&s;hes we had with the Enemy.
The Enemy had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Country,
and had taken effectual Care to furni&s;h their
Army with Provi&s;ions; they placed their Guards
in &s;uch excellent Order, to &s;ecure their Convoys,
that their Waggons went from Stage to Stage as
quiet as in a time of Peace, and were relieved
every five Miles by Parties con&s;tantly po&s;ted on
the Road. And thus the Imperial General &s;at
down by us, not doubting but he &s;hould force
the King either to fight his Way through, on
very di&s;advantageous Terms, or to ri&s;e for want
of Provi&s;ions, and leave the City of <HI>Noremberg</HI>
a Prey to his Army; for he had vowed the De|&s;truction
of the City, and to make it a &s;econd
<HI>Magdeburg.</HI></P>
<P>But the King, who was not to be ea&s;ily de|ceived,
had countermined all <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI>'s De&s;igns;
he had pa&s;&s;ed his Honour to the <HI>Norembergers,</HI>
that he would not leave them, and they had
undertaken to Victual his Army, and &s;ecure him
from Want, which they did &s;o effectually, that
<PB N="115" REF="121">
he had no Occa&s;ion to expo&s;e his Troops to any
Hazard or Fatigues for Convoys or Forage on
any Account whatever.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Noremberg</HI> is a very rich&punc; and po|pulous
City; and the King being very &s;en&s;ible of
their Danger, had given his Word for their De|fence:
And when they, being terrified at the
Threats of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> &s;ent their Deputies to
be&s;eech the King to take care of them, he &s;ent
them Word, he would, and be be&s;ieged with them.
They on the other Hand laid in &s;uch Stores of
all Sorts of Provi&s;ion, both for Men and Hor&s;e,
that had <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> lain before it &s;ix Months longer,
there would have been no Scarcity. Every private
Hou&s;e was a Magazine, the Camp was plenti|fully
&s;upplied with all Manner of Provi&s;ions, and
the Market always full, and as cheap as in Times
of Peace. The Magi&s;trates were &s;o careful, and
pre&s;erved &s;o excellent an Order in the Di&s;po&s;al
of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion, that no engro&s;&s;ing of
Corn could be practi&s;ed; for the Prices were
every Day directed at the Town-hou&s;e: And if
any Man offered to demand more Money for
Corn, than the &s;tated Price, he could not &s;ell,
becau&s;e at the Town Store-hou&s;e you might buy
cheaper. Here are two In&s;tances of good and
bad Conduct; the City of <HI>Magdeburgh</HI> had been
intreated by the King to &s;ettle Funds, and rai&s;e
Money for their Provi&s;ion and Security, and to
have a &s;ufficient Garri&s;on to defend them, but they
made Difficulties, either to rai&s;e Men for them|&s;elves,
or to admit the King's Troops to affift
them, for fear of the Charge of maintaining
them; and this was the Cau&s;e of the City's
Ruin.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Noremberg</HI> open'd their Arm sto
receive the A&s;&s;i&s;tance proferred by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
<PB N="116" REF="122">
their Pur&s;es to defend their Town, and Common
Cau&s;e, and this was the &s;aving them ab&s;olutely
from De&s;truction. The rich Burghers and Ma|gi&s;trates
kept open Hou&s;es, where the Officers
of the Army were always welcome; and the
Council of the City took &s;uch Care of the Poor,
that there was no Complaining nor Di&s;orders in
the whole City. There is no doubt but it co&s;t the
City a great deal of Money; but I never &s;aw a
publick Charge borne with &s;o much Chearful|ne&s;s,
nor managed with &s;o much Prudence and
Conduct in my Life. The City fed above 50000
Mouths every Day, including their own Poor,
be&s;ides them&s;elves; and yet when the King had
lain thus 3 Months, and finding his Armies
longer in coming up than he expected, asked the
Burgrave how their Magazines held out? He
an&s;wered, they de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty not to ha&s;ten
things for them, for they could maintain them|&s;elves
and him 12 Months longer, if there was
Occa&s;ion. This Plenty kept both the Army and
City in good Health, as well as in good Heart;
whereas nothing was to be had of us but Blows;
for we fetched nothing from without our Works,
nor had no Bu&s;ine&s;s without the Line, but to
interrupt the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Manner of the King's Encampment de|&s;erves
a particular Chapter. He was a compleat
Surveyor, and a Ma&s;ter in Fortification, not to
be outdone by any Body. He had po&s;ted his
Army in the Suburbs of the Town, and drawn
Lines round the whole Circumference, &s;o that
he begirt the whole City with his Army; his
Works were large, the Ditch deep, flanked with in|numerable
Ba&s;tions, Ravelins, Horn-works, Forts,
Redoubts, Batteries and Palli&s;adoes, the ince&s;&s;ant
Work of 8000 Men&punc; for about 14 Days; be&s;ides
<PB N="117" REF="123">
that the King was adding &s;ome thing or other
to it every Day; and the very Po&s;ture of his
Camp was enough to tell a bigger Army than
<HI>Walle&s;tein</HI>'s, that he was not to be a&s;&s;aulted in his
Trenches.</P>
<P>The King's De&s;ign appeared chiefly to be the
Pre&s;ervation of the City; but that was not all:
He had three Armies acting abroad in three &s;everal
Places; <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> was on the <HI>Mo&s;el,</HI> the Chan|cellor
<HI>Oxen&s;tern</HI> about <HI>Mentz, Cologn,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
Duke <HI>William</HI> and Duke <HI>Bernard,</HI> together with
General <HI>Bannier</HI> in <HI>Bavaria.</HI> And though he de|&s;igned
they &s;hould all join him, and had wrote
to them all to that purpo&s;e, yet he did not
ha&s;ten them, knowing that while he kept the
main Army at Bay about <HI>Noremberg,</HI> they would
without Oppo&s;ition reduce tho&s;e &s;everal Coun|tries
they were acting in to his Power. This
occa&s;ioned his lying longer in the Camp at <HI>No|remberg</HI>
than he would have done, and this oc|ca&s;ioned
his giving the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> &s;o many Alarms
by his &s;trong Parties of Hor&s;e, of which he was
well provided, that they might not be able to
make any con&s;iderable Detachments for the Re|lief
of their Friends: And here he &s;hewed his
Ma&s;ter&s;hip in the War; for by this means his
Conque&s;ts went on as effectually as if he had been
abroad him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, it was not to be expected
two &s;uch Armies &s;hould lye long &s;o near without
&s;ome Action; the Imperial Army being Ma&s;ters
of the Field, laid the Country for 20 Miles round
<HI>Noremberg</HI> in a manner de&s;olate; what the Inha|bitants
could carry away had been before &s;ecured
in &s;uch &s;trong Towns as had Garri&s;ons to protect
them, and what was left, the hungry <HI>Crabats</HI> de|voured,
or &s;et on Fire; but &s;ometimes they were
<PB N="118" REF="124">
met with by our Men, who often paid them home
for it. There had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;mall Rencoun|ters
between our Parties and theirs; and as it
falls out in &s;uch Ca&s;es, &s;ometimes one Side, &s;ome|times
the other, got the better; but I have
ob&s;erved there never was any Party &s;ent out by
the King's &s;pecial Appointment, but always came
home with Victory.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;iderable Attempt, as I remember,
was made on a Convoy of Ammunition: The Party
&s;ent out was commanded by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Collonel, and
con&s;i&s;ted of a 1000 Hor&s;e, and 500 Dragoons,
who burnt above 600 Waggons, loaden with
Ammunition and Stores for the Army, be&s;ides tak|ing
about 2000 Mu&s;quets which they brought
back to the Army.</P>
<P>The latter end of <HI>July</HI> the King received Ad|vice,
that the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> had formed a Magazine
for Provi&s;ion at a Town called <HI>Freyn&s;tat,</HI> 20 Miles
from <HI>Noremberg.</HI> Hither all the Booty and Con|tributions
rai&s;ed in the <HI>&V;pper Palatinate,</HI> and
Parts adjacent, was brought and laid up as in a
Place of Security; a Garri&s;on of 600 Men being
placed to defend it; and when a Quantity of Pro|vi&s;ions
was got together, Convoys were appointed
to fetch it off.</P>
<P>The King was re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to take or de|&s;troy
this Magazine; and &s;ending for Collonel
<HI>Dubalt,</HI> a <HI>Swede,</HI> and a Man of extraordinary Con|duct,
he tells him his De&s;ign, and withal, that
he mu&s;t be the Man to put it in Execution, and
ordered him to take what Forces he thought con|venient.
The Collonel, who knew the Town
very well, and the Country about it, told his
Maje&s;ty, he would attempt it with all his Heart;
but he was affraid 'twould require &s;ome Foot to
make the Attack; but we cant &s;tay for that, &s;ays
<PB N="119" REF="125">
the King, you mu&s;t then take &s;ome Dragoons
with you, and immediately the King called for
me. I was ju&s;t coming up the Stairs, as the King's
Page was come out to enquire for me; &s;o I went
immediately in to the King. Here is a Piece of
hot Work for you, &s;ays the King, <HI>Dubalt</HI> will
tell it you; go together and contrive it.</P>
<P>We immediately withdrew, and the Collonel
told me the De&s;ign, and what the King and he
had di&s;cour&s;ed; that in his Opinion Foot would
be wanted: But the King had declared there was
no Time for the Foot to march, and had pro|po&s;ed
Dragoons. I told him, I thought Dragoons
might do as well; &s;o we agreed to take 1600
Hor&s;e and 400 Dragoons. The King, impatient
in his De&s;ign, came into the Room to us to know
what we had re&s;olved on, approved our Mea&s;ures,
gave us Orders immediately; and turning to me,
you &s;hall command the Dragoons, &s;ays the King,
but <HI>Dubalt</HI> mu&s;t be General in this Ca&s;e, for he
knows the Country. Your Maje&s;ty, &s;aid I, &s;hall
be always &s;erved by me in any Figure you plea&s;e.
The King wi&s;hed us good Speed, and hurried
us away the &s;ame Afternoon, in order to come to
the Place in Time. We marched &s;lowly on be|cau&s;e
of the Carriages we had with us, and came
to <HI>Freyn&s;tat</HI> about One a Clock in the Night per|fectly
undi&s;coverd; the Guards were &s;o negli|gent,
that we came to the very Port before they
had Notice of us, and a Serjeant with 12 Dragoons
thru&s;t in upon the Out-Centinels, and killed them
without Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Immediately Ladders were placed to the Half-Moon
which defended the Gate, which the Dra|goons
mounted and carried in a trice, about 28
Men being cut in Pieces within. As &s;oon as the
<PB N="120" REF="126">
Ravelin was taken, they bur&s;t open the Gate, at
which I entered at the Head of 200 Dragoons,
and &s;eized the Drawbridge. By this Time the
Town was in Alarm, and the Drums beat to
Arms, but it was too late; for by the help of a
Petard we broke open the Gate, and entered
the Town. The Garri&s;on made an ob&s;tinate
Fight for about half an Hour, but our Men be|ing
all in, and 3 Troops of Hor&s;e di&s;mounted
coming to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance with their Carabines,
the Town was entirely ma&s;tered by Three of
the Clock, and Guards &s;et to prevent any Body
running to give Notice to the Enemy. There
were about 200 of the Garri&s;on killed, and
the re&s;t taken Pri&s;oners. The Town being thus
&s;ecured, the Gates were opened, and Collonel
<HI>Dubalt</HI> came in with the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Guards being &s;et, we entered the Maga|zine
where we found an incredible Quantity of all
&s;orts of Provi&s;ion. There was 150 Tun of Bread,
8000 Sacks of Meal, 4000 Sacks of Oats, and
of other Provi&s;ions in Proportion. We cau&s;ed as
much of it as could be loaded to be brought away
in &s;uch Waggons and Carriages as we found, and
&s;et the re&s;t on Fire, Town and all; we &s;taid by it
till we &s;aw it pa&s;t a Po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;aved,
and then drew off with 800 Waggons, which we
found in the Place, mo&s;t of which we loaded
with Bread, Meal and Oats. While we were
doing this we &s;ent a Party of Dragoons into the
Field, who met us again as we came out, with
above a 1000 Head of Black Cattle, be&s;ides
Sheep.</P>
<P>Our next Care was to bring this Booty home
without meeting with the Enemy; to &s;ecure which,
the Collonel immediately di&s;patch'd an Expre&s;s to
<PB N="121" REF="127">
the King, to let him know of our Succe&s;s, and to
de&s;ire a Detachment might be made to &s;ecure our
Retreat, being charged with &s;o much Plunder.</P>
<P>And it was no more than Need; for tho' we had
u&s;ed all the Diligence po&s;&s;ible to prevent any
Notice, yet &s;ome body more forward than ordi|nary,
had &s;cap'd away and carried News of it to
the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army. The General upon this bad
News detaches Major General <HI>Sparr,</HI> with a Body
of 6000 Men to cut off our Retreat. The King,
who had Notice of this Detachment, marches
out in Per&s;on with 3000 Men to wait upon Gene|ral
<HI>Sparr:</HI> All this was the Account of one Day;
the King met General <HI>Sparr</HI> at the Moment when
h$s Troops were divided, fell upon them, routed
one Part of them, and the re&s;t in a few Hours
after; killed them a 1000 Men, and took the Ge|neral
Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>In the Interval of this Action, we came &s;afe to
the Camp with our Booty, which was very con|&s;iderable,
and would have &s;upplied our whole Ar|my
for a Month. Thus we fea&s;ted at the Enemy's
Co&s;t, and beat them into the Bargain.</P>
<P>The King gave all the live Cattle to the <HI>No|rembergers,</HI>
who, tho' they had really no want of
Provi&s;ions, yet fre&s;h Meat was not &s;o plentiful as
&s;uch Provi&s;ions which were &s;tored up in Ve&s;&s;els
and laid by.</P>
<P>After this Skirmi&s;h, we had the Country more
at Command than before, and daily fetch'd in
fre&s;h Provi&s;ions and Forage in the Fields.</P>
<P>The two Armies had now lain a long Time in
&s;ight of one another, and daily Skirmi&s;hes had
con&s;iderably weakened them; and the King be|ginning
to be impatient, ha&s;tened the Advance|ment
of his Friends to join him, in which al&s;o
they were not backward; but having drawn to|gether
<PB N="122" REF="128">
their Forces from &s;everal Parts, and all
joined the Chancellor <HI>Oxen&s;tern,</HI> News came the
15th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> that they were in full March to
join us; and being come to a &s;mall Town called
<HI>Brock,</HI> the King went out of the Camp with about
1000 Hor&s;e to view them. I went along with the
Hor&s;e, and the 21&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> &s;aw the Review of
all the Armies together, which were 30000 Men
in extraordinary Equipage, old Soldiers, and
commanded by Officers of the greate&s;t Conduct
and Experience in the World. There was the rich
Chancellor of <HI>Sweden</HI> who commanded as General,
<HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> and <HI>John Bannier,</HI> both <HI>Swedes</HI> and
old Generals; Duke <HI>William</HI> and Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> of
<HI>Weymar,</HI> the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> the Pala|tine
of <HI>Birkenfelt,</HI> and Abundance of Princes and
Lords of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Armies being joined, the King who was
now a Match for <HI>Walle&s;tein,</HI> quits his Camp and
draws up in Battalia before the <HI>Imperial</HI> Trenches;
but the Scene was changed; <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> was no
more able to fight now than the King was before;
but keeping within his Trenches, &s;tood upon his
Guard. The King coming up clo&s;e to his Works,
plants Batteries, and cannonaded him in his very
Camp.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> finding the King pre&s;s upon
them, retreat into a woody Country about three
Leagues, and taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an old ruin'd
Ca&s;tle, po&s;ted their Army behind it.</P>
<P>This old Ca&s;tle they fortified, and placed a very
&s;trong Guard there. The King having viewed the
Place, tho' it was a very &s;trong Po&s;t, re&s;olved to
attack it with the whole right Wing. The Attack
was made with a great deal of Order and Re&s;olu|tion,
the King leading the fir&s;t Party on with
Sword in Hand, and the Fight was maintained
<PB N="123" REF="129">
on both Sides with the utmo&s;t Gallantry and Ob|&s;tinacy
all the Day and the next Night too; for
the Cannon and Mu&s;quet never gave over 'till the
Morning; but the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> having the Advan|tage
of the Hill, of their Works and Batteries,
and being continually relieved, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> na|ked,
without Cannon or Works, the Po&s;t was
maintained; and the King finding it would co&s;t
him too much Blood, drew off in the Morning</P>
<P>This was the famous Fight at <HI>Attembergh,</HI> where
the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> boa&s;ted to have &s;hewn the World
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was not invincible. They call
it the Victory at <HI>Attembergh;</HI> 'tis true, the King
failed in his Attempt of carrying their Works,
but there was &s;o little of a Victory in it, that the
<HI>Imperial</HI> General thought fit not to venture a &s;e|cond
Bru&s;h, but to draw off their Army as &s;oon as
they could to a &s;afer Quarter.</P>
<P>I had no Share in this Attack, very few of the
Hor&s;e being in the Action; but my Comerade,
who was always among the <HI>Scots</HI> Voluntiers was
wounded and taken Pri&s;oner by the Enemy. They
u&s;ed him very civilly, and the King and <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI>
&s;training Courte&s;ies with one another, the King
relea&s;ed Major General <HI>Sparr</HI> without Ran&s;om,
and the <HI>Imperial</HI> General &s;ent home Collonel <HI>Tor|ten&s;on</HI>
a <HI>Swede,</HI> and 16 Voluntier Gentlemen who
were taken in the Heat of the Action, among
whom my Captain was one.</P>
<P>The King lay 14 Days facing the <HI>Imperial</HI> Ar|my,
and u&s;ing all the Stratagems po&s;&s;ible to bring
them to a Battle, but to no purpo&s;e; during
which Time, we had Parties continually out, and
very often Skirmi&s;hes with the Enemy.</P>
<P>I had a Command of one of the&s;e Parties in an
Adventure, wherein I got no Booty, nor much
Honour. The King had received Advice of a Con|voy
<PB N="124" REF="130">
of Provi&s;ions which was to come to the Ene|my's
Camp from the <HI>&V;pper Palatinate,</HI> and ha|ving
a great Mind to &s;urprize them, he command|ed
us to way-lay them with 1200 Hor&s;e, and 800
Dragoons. I had exact Directions given me of the
Way they were to come, and po&s;ting my Hor&s;e
in a Village a little out of the Road, I lay with my
Dragoons in a Wood, by which they were to pa&s;s
by break of Day. The Enemy appeared with
their Convoy, and being very wary, their Out-Scouts
di&s;covered us in the Wood, and fired upon
the Centinel I had po&s;ted in a Tree at the En|trance
of the Wood. Finding my &s;elf di&s;covered,
I would have retreated to the Village where my
Hor&s;e were po&s;ted, but in a Moment the Wood
was skirted with the Enemy's Hor&s;e, and a Thou|&s;and
commanded Mu&s;queteers advanced to beat
me out. In this Pickle I &s;ent away three Me&s;&s;en|gers
one after another for the Hor&s;e, who were
within two Miles of me, to advance to my Relief;
but all my Me&s;&s;engers fell into the Enemy's Hands.
400 of my Dragoons on foot, whom I had plac'd at a
little Di&s;tance before me, &s;tood to their Work, and
beat off two Charges of the Enemy's Foot with &s;ome
Lo&s;s on both Sides: Mean Time 200 of my Men
fac'd about, and ru&s;hing out of the Wood, broke
through a Party of the Enemy's Hor&s;e who &s;tood
to watch our coming out. I confe&s;s I was ex|ceedingly
&s;urprized at it, thinking tho&s;e Fellows
had done it to make their E&s;cape, or el&s;e were
gone over to the Enemy; and my Men were &s;o
di&s;couraged at it, that they began to look about
which way to run to &s;ave them&s;elves, and were
ju&s;t upon the Point of disbanding to &s;hift for
them&s;elves, when one of the Captains called to
me aloud to beat a Parle and Treat. I made no An|&s;wer,
but, as if I had not heard him, immediately
<PB N="125" REF="131">
gave the Word for all the Captains to come to|gether.
The Con&s;ultation was but &s;hort, for the
Mu&s;queteers were advancing to a third Charge,
with Numbers which we were not likely to deal
with. In &s;hort, we re&s;olved to beat a Parle, and
demand Quarter, for that was all we could ex|pect;
when on a &s;udden the Body of Hor&s;e I had
po&s;ted in the Village being directed by the Nol&s;e,
had advanced to relieve me, if they &s;aw Occa&s;ion,
and had met the 200 Dragoons who guided them
directly to the Spot where they had broke thro',
and all together fell upon the Hor&s;e of the Ene|my
who were po&s;ted on that Side, and ma&s;tering
them before they could be relieved, cut them all
to Pieces and brought me off. Under the Shelter
of this Party, we made good our Retreat to the
Village, but we lo&s;t above 300 Men, and were
glad to make off from the Village too, for the
Enemy were very much too &s;trong for us.</P>
<P>Returning thence towards the Camp, we fell
foul with 200 <HI>Crabats</HI> who had been upon the
plundering Account: We made our &s;elves &s;ome
Amends upon them for our former Lo&s;s, for we
&s;hew'd them no Mercy; but our Misfortunes were
not ended, for we had but ju&s;t di&s;patch'd tho&s;e
<HI>Crabats</HI> when we fell in with 3000 <HI>Imperial</HI> Hor&s;e,
who, on the Expectation of the afore&s;aid Convoy,
were &s;ent out to &s;ecure them.</P>
<P>All I could do, could not per&s;uade my Men
to &s;tand their Ground again&s;t this Party; &s;o that
finding they would run away in Confu&s;ion, I a|greed
to make off, and facing to the Right, we
went over a large Common a full Trot, 'till at la&s;t
Fear, which always encrea&s;es in a Flight, brought
us to a plain Flight, the Enemy at our Heels.
I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was never &s;o mortified in my
Life; 'twas to no Purpo&s;e to turn Head, no Man
<PB N="126" REF="132">
would &s;tand by us, we run for Life, and a great
many we left by the Way who were either wound|ed
by the Enemy's Shot, or el&s;e could not keep
Race with us.</P>
<P>At la&s;t having got over the Common, which
was near two Miles, we came to a Lane; one
of our Captains, a <HI>Saxon</HI> by Country, and a Gen|tleman
of a good Fortune alighted at the Entrance
of the Lane, and with a bold Heart faced about,
&s;hot his own Hor&s;e, and called his Men to &s;tand
by him and defend the Lane. Some of his Men
halted, and we rallied about 600 Men which
we po&s;ted as well as we could, to defend the
Pa&s;s; but the Enemy charged us with great Fury.
The <HI>Saxon</HI> Gentleman, after defending him&s;elf
with exceeding Gallantry and refu&s;ing Quarter,
was killed upon the Spot: A <HI>German</HI> Dragoon
as I thought him, gave me a rude Blow with the
Stock of his Piece on the Side of my Head, and
was ju&s;t going to repeat it, when one of my Men
&s;hot him dead. I was &s;o &s;tunn'd with the Blow,
that I knew nothing; but recovering, I found my
&s;elf in the Hands of two of the Enemy's Officers,
who offered me Quarter, which I accepted; and
indeed, to give them their due, they u&s;ed me ve|ry
civilly. Thus this whole Party was defeated,
and not above 500 Men got &s;afe to the Army, nor
had half the Number e&s;caped, had not the <HI>Saxon</HI>
Captain made &s;o bold a Stand at the Head of
the Lane.</P>
<P>Several other Parties of the King's Army re|venged
our Quarrel, and paid them home for it;
but I had a particular Lo&s;s in this Defeat, that I
never &s;aw the King after; for tho' his Maje&s;ty
&s;ent a Trumpet to reclaim us as Pri&s;oners the
very next Day, yet I was not delivered, &s;ome Scru|ple
happening about exchanging, 'till after the
<PB N="127" REF="133">
Battle of <HI>Lutzen,</HI> where that Gallant Prince lo&s;t
his Life.</P>
<P>The Imperial Army ri&s;e from their Camp about
eight or ten Days after the King had removed,
and I was carried Pri&s;oner in the Army 'till they
&s;at down to the Siege of <HI>Coburgh Ca&s;tle,</HI> and then
was left with other Pri&s;oners of War, in the Cu|&s;tody
of Collonel <HI>Spezuter,</HI> in a &s;mall Ca&s;tle near
the Camp called <HI>New&s;tad.</HI> Here we continued
indifferent well treated, but could learn nothing
of what Action the Armies were upon, 'till the
Duke of <HI>Friedland</HI> having been beaten off from the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Coburgh,</HI> marched into <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the
Pri&s;oners were &s;ent for into the Camp, as was &s;aid,
in order to be exchanged.</P>
<P>I came into the Imperial Leager at the Siege
of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> and within three Days after my com|ing,
the City was &s;urrendred, and I got Liberty
to lodge at my old Quarters in the Town upon
my Parole.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was at the Heels of the <HI>Im|periali&s;ts;</HI>
for finding <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> re&s;olved to ruin
the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the King had recollected as
much of his divided Army as he could, and came
upon him ju&s;t as he was going to be&s;iege <HI>Torgau.</HI></P>
<P>As it it is not my De&s;ign to write a Hi&s;tory of
any more of the&s;e Wars than I was actually con|cerned
in, &s;o I &s;hall only note, that upon the
King's Approach, <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> halted, and likewife
called all his Troops together; for he apprehend|ed
the King would fall on him; and we that were
Pri&s;oners, fancied the <HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers went un|willingly
out; for the very Name of the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> was become terrible to them. In
&s;hort, they drew all the Soldiers of the Garri|&s;on
they could &s;pare, out of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> &s;ent for <HI>Pa|penheim</HI>
again, who was gone but three Days
<PB N="128" REF="134">
fore with 6000 Men on a private Expedition. On
the 16th of <HI>November,</HI> the Armies met on the
Plains of <HI>Lutzen;</HI> a long and bloody Battle was
fought; the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> were entirely routed and
beaten, 12000 &s;lain upon the Spot, their Cannon,
Baggage and 2000 Pri&s;oners taken, but the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> lo&s;t his Life, being killed at the Head of
his Troops in the Begining of the Fight.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Con&s;ternation the
Death of this conquering King &s;truck into all the
Princes of <HI>Germany;</HI> the Grief for him exceeded
all Manner of human Sorrow: All People looked
upon them&s;elves as ruined and &s;wallowed up; the
Inhabitants of two Thirds of all <HI>Germany</HI> put them|&s;elves
into Mourning for him; when the Mini|&s;ters
mentioned him in their Sermons or Prayers,
whole Congregations would bur&s;t out into Tears:
The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> was utterly incon&s;olable,
and would for &s;everal Days walk about his Pa|lace
like a di&s;tracted Man, crying the Saviour of
<HI>Germany</HI> was lo&s;t, the Refuge of abu&s;ed Princes
was gone; the Soul of the War was dead, and
from that Hour was &s;o hopele&s;s of out-living the
War, that he &s;ought to make Peace with the Em|peror.</P>
<P>Three Days after this mournful Victory, the
<HI>Saxons</HI> recovered the Town of <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> by Strata|gem.
The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Forces lay at <HI>Torgau,</HI>
and perceiving the Confu&s;ion the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> were
in at the News of the Overthrow of their Army,
they re&s;olved to attempt the Recovery of the
Town. They &s;ent about 20 &s;cattering Troopers who
pretending them&s;elves to be <HI>Imperali&s;ts</HI> fled from
the Battle, were let in one by one, and &s;till as
they came in, they &s;taid at the Court of Guard in
the Port, entertaining the Souldiers with Di&s;|cour&s;e
about the Fight, and how they e&s;caped, and
<PB N="129" REF="135">
the like; 'till the whole Number being got in at
a Watch Word, they fell on the Guard, and cut
them all in Pieces; and immediately opening the
Gate to three Troops of <HI>Saxon</HI> Hor&s;e, the Town
was taken in a Moment.</P>
<P>It was a welcome Surpri&s;e to me, for I was
at Liberty of Cour&s;e; and the War being now
on another Foot, as I thought, and the King dead,
I re&s;olved to quit the Service.</P>
<P>I had &s;ent my Man, as I have already noted in|to
<HI>England,</HI> in Order to bring over the Troops
my Father had rai&s;ed for the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI>
He executed his Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o well, that he
landed with five Troops at <HI>Embden,</HI> in very good
Condition; and Orders were &s;ent them by the
King, to join the Duke of <HI>Lunenberg</HI>'s Army;
which they did at the Siege of <HI>Boxtude,</HI> in the
Lower <HI>Saxony.</HI> Here by long and very &s;harp Ser|vice
they were mo&s;t of them cut off, and though
they were &s;everal Times recruited, yet I under|&s;tood
there were not three full Troops left.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxe-Weymar,</HI> a Gentleman of
great Courage, had the Command of the Army
after the King's Death, and managed it with &s;o
much Prudence, that all things were in as much
Order as could be expected, after &s;o great a Lo&s;s;
for the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> where every where beaten, and
<HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> never made any Advantage of the King's
Death.</P>
<P>I waited on him at <HI>Hailbron,</HI> whither he was
gone to meet the great Chancellor of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
where I paid him my Re&s;pects, and de&s;ired he
would be&s;tow the Remainder of my Regiment
on my Comerade the Captain, which he did with
all the Civility and Readine&s;s imaginable: So I took
my Leave of him, and prepared to come for
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136">
I &s;hall only note this, that at this Dyet, the Pro|te&s;tant
Princes of the Empire renewed their League
with one another, and with the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and came to &s;everal Regulations and Conclu&s;ions
for the carrying on the War; which they after|wards
pro&s;ecuted under the Direction of the
&s;aid Chancellor of <HI>Sweden.</HI> But it was not the
Work of a &s;mall Difficulty, nor of a &s;hort Time;
and having been per&s;waded to continue almo&s;t
two Years afterwards at <HI>Frankfort, Hailbron,</HI> and
thereabout, by the particular Friend&s;hip of that
noble wi&s;e Man, and extraordinary State&s;man
<HI>Axell Oxen&s;tern,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Sweden,</HI> I had Oppor|tunity
to be concerned in, and pre&s;ent at &s;everal
Treaties of extraordinary Con&s;equence, &s;ufficient
for a Hi&s;tory, if that were my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Particularly I had the Happine&s;s to be pre&s;ent
at, and have &s;ome Concern in the Treaty for the
re&s;toring the Po&s;terity of the truly noble <HI>Pal&s;|grave</HI>
King of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> of <HI>England</HI>
had indeed too much neglected the whole Family;
and I may &s;ay with Authority enough, from my
own Knowledge of Affairs, had nothing been done
for them but what was from <HI>England,</HI> that Fami|ly
had remained de&s;olate and for&s;aken to this Day.</P>
<P>But that glorious King, whom I can never
mention without &s;ome Remark of his extraordina|ry
Merit, had left particular Inftructions with
his Chancellor to re&s;cue the <HI>Palatinate</HI> to its right|ful
Lord, as a Proof of his De&s;ign to re&s;tore the
the Liberty of <HI>Germany,</HI> and rein&s;tate the oppre&s;|&s;ed
Princes who were &s;ubjected to the Tyranny of
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Re&s;olution, the Chancellor
proceeded very much like a Man of Honour;
and tho' the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was dead a little
<PB N="131" REF="137">
before, yet he carefully managed the Trea|ty,
an&s;wered the Objections of &s;everal Prin|ces,
who, in the general Ruin of the Family, had
reaped private Advantages, &s;ettled the Capitu|lations
for the Quota of Contributions, very
much for their Advantage, and fully rein&s;talled
the Prince <HI>Charles</HI> in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his Do|minions
in the <HI>Lower Palatinate,</HI> which afterwards
was confirmed to him and his Po&s;terity by the
Peace of <HI>We&s;t-Phalia,</HI> where all the&s;e bloody Wars
were fini&s;hed in a Peace, which has &s;ince been the
Foundation of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> Liberty, and the be&s;t
Security of the whole Empire.</P>
<P>I &s;pent two Years rather in wandring up and
down, than travelling; for tho' I had no Mind to
&s;erve, yet I could not find in my Heart to leave
<HI>Germany;</HI> and I had obtained &s;ome &s;o very clo&s;e
Intimacies with the General Officers, that I was
often in the Army, and &s;ometimes they did me
the Honour to bring me into their Councils
of War.</P>
<P>Particularly, at that eminent Council before
the Battle of <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> I was invited to the
Council of War, both by Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> of <HI>Wey|mar,</HI>
and by <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horne.</HI> They were Gene|rals
of equal Worth, and their Courage and Ex|perience
had been &s;o well, and &s;o often tried,
that more than ordinary Regard was always given
to what they &s;aid. Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> was indeed
the younger Man, and <HI>Gu&s;tvaus</HI> had &s;erved longer
under our Great Schoolma&s;ter the King; but
'twas hard to judge which was the better Gene|ral,
&s;ince both had Experience enough, and &s;hewn
undeniable Proofs both of their Bravery and
Conduct.</P>
<P>I am obliged, in the Cour&s;e of my Relation,
&s;o often to mention the great Re&s;pect I often re|ceived
<PB N="132" REF="138">
from the&s;e great Men, that it makes me
&s;ometimes jealous, lea&s;t the Reader may think
I affect it as a Vanity. The Truth is, and I am
ready to confe&s;s the Honours I received, upon all
Occa&s;ions, from Per&s;ons of &s;uch Worth, and
who had &s;uch an eminent Share in the greate&s;t
Action of that Age, very much plea&s;ed me;
and particularly, as they gave me Occa&s;ions to
&s;ee every thing that was doing on the whole
Stage of the War: For being under no Com|mand,
but at Liberty to rove about, I could come
to no <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on or Party, but &s;ending my
Name to the commanding Officer I could have
<HI>the Word</HI> &s;ent me; and if I came into the Army,
I was often treated as I was now at this famous
Battle of <HI>Nordlingen.</HI></P>
<P>But I cannot but &s;ay, that I always looked
upon this particular Re&s;pect to be the Effect
of more than ordinary Regard the great King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> always &s;hewed me, rather than any
Merit of my own; and the Veneration they all
had for his Memory, made them continue to
&s;hew me all the Marks of a &s;uitable E&s;teem.</P>
<P>But to return to the Council of War, the great,
and indeed the only Que&s;tion before us was, &s;hall
we give Battle to the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> or not? <HI>Gu&s;tavus
Horn</HI> was again&s;t it, and gave, as I thought, the
mo&s;t invincible Arguments again&s;t a Battle that
Rea&s;on could imagine.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They were weaker than the Enemy by
above 5000 Men.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Cardinal Infant of <HI>Spain,</HI> who
was in the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army with 8000 Men, was
but there <HI>en Pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> being going from <HI>Italy</HI> to
<HI>Flanders,</HI> to take upon him the Government of the
<HI>Low Countries;</HI> and if he &s;aw no Pro&s;pect of im|mediate
Action, would be gone in a few Days.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="139">
Thirdly, They had two Reinforcements, one
of 5000 Men, under the Command of Collonel
<HI>Cratz,</HI> and one of 7000 Men under the Rhinegrave,
who were ju&s;t at Hand, the la&s;t within three
Days March of them: And</P>
<P>La&s;tly, They had already &s;aved their Honour,
in that they had put 600 Foot into the Town
of <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> in the Face of the Enemy's Army
and con&s;equently the Town might hold out &s;ome
Days the longer.</P>
<P>Fate rather than Rea&s;on certainly blinded the
re&s;t of the Generals again&s;t &s;uch Arguments as
the&s;e. Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> and almo&s;t all the Generals
were for Fighting, alledging, the Affront it would
be to the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Reputation, to &s;ee their Friends
in the Town lo&s;t before their Faces.</P>
<P><HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> &s;tood &s;tiff to his cautious Advice,
and was again&s;t it; and I thought the Baron <HI>D'Off|kirk</HI>
treated him a little indecently; for being
very warm in the Matter, he told them; <HI>That if</HI>
Gu&s;tavus Adolphus <HI>had been governed by &s;uch cow|ardly
Council, he had never been Conqueror of half</HI> Ger|many
<HI>in two Years. No,</HI> replied old General <HI>Horn,</HI>
very &s;martly, <HI>But he had been now alive to have
te&s;tified for me, that I was never taken by him for a
Coward; and yet</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the King was never for a
Victory with a Hazard, when he could have it without.</HI></P>
<P>I was asked my Opinion, which I would have
declined, being in no Commi&s;&s;ion; but they
pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;peak. I told them, I was for
&s;taying at lea&s;t till the Rhinegrave came up; who
at lea&s;t might, if Expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent to ha&s;ten
him, be up with us in 24 Hours. But <HI>Offkirk</HI>
could not hold his Pa&s;&s;ion, and had not he been
over-rul'd, he would have almo&s;t quarrelled with
Mar&s;hal <HI>Horn.</HI> Upon which the old General, not
<PB N="134" REF="140">
to foment him, with a great deal of Mildne&s;s
&s;tood up, and &s;poke thus.</P>
<P><HI>Come,</HI> Offkirk, &s;ays he, <HI>I'll &s;ubmit my Opinion to
you and the Majority of our Fellow-Soldiers: We will
fight, but upon my Word we &s;hall have our Hands full.</HI></P>
<P>The Re&s;olution thus taken, they attacked the
<HI>Imperial</HI> Army. I mu&s;t confe&s;s the Councils of
this Day &s;eemed as confu&s;ed as the Re&s;olutions
of the Night.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> was to lead the Van of the Left
Wing, and to po&s;t him&s;elf upon a Hill which was
on the Enemy's Right without their Entrench|ments;
&s;o that having &s;ecured that Po&s;t, they
might level their Cannon upon the Foot who
&s;tood behind the Lines, and relieved the Town
at Plea&s;ure. He marched accordingly by Break
of Day, and falling with great Fury upon 8 Re|giments
of Foot which were po&s;ted at the Foot
of the Hill, he pre&s;ently routed them and made
him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Po&s;t. Flu&s;hed with this Suc|ce&s;s,
he never regards his own concerted Mea|&s;ures
of &s;topping there, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what he
had got, but pu&s;hes on and falls in with the
Main Body of the Enemy's Army.</P>
<P>While this was doing, <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> attacks
another Po&s;t on a Hill, were the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had
po&s;ted and lodged them&s;elves behind &s;ome Works
they had ca&s;t up on the &s;ide of the Hill; here
they defended them&s;elves with extreme Ob|&s;tinacy
for five Hours, and at la&s;t obliged the
<HI>Swedes</HI> to give it over with Lo&s;s. This extraor|dinary
Gallantry of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was the &s;aving
of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army; for Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> having
all this while re&s;i&s;ted the frequent Charges of
the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> and borne the Weight of two
<PB N="135" REF="141">
Thirds of their Army, was not able to &s;tand any
longer, but &s;ending one Me&s;&s;enger in the Neck
of another to <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> for more Foot, he
finding he could not carry his Point, had given
it over, and was in full March to &s;econd the
Duke. But now 'twas too late; for the King of
<HI>Hungary</HI> &s;eeing the Duke's Men as it were wave|ring,
and having Notice of <HI>Horn</HI>'s wheeling about
to &s;econd him, falls in with all his Force upon
his Flank, and with his <HI>Hungarian</HI> Hu&s;&s;ars, made
&s;uch a furious Charge, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> could
&s;tand no longer.</P>
<P>The Rout of the Left Wing was &s;o much the
more unhappy, as it happened ju&s;t upon <HI>Gu&s;tavus
Horn</HI>'s coming up; for being pu&s;hed on with the
Enemies at their Heels, they were driven upon
their own Friends, who having no Ground, to
open, and give them way, were trodden down
by their own run-away Brethren. This brought
all into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion. The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI>
cried <HI>Victoria,</HI> and fell into the Middle of the In|fantry
with a terrible Slaughter.</P>
<P>I have always ob&s;erved, 'tis fatal to upbraid
an old experienced Officer with want of Cou|rage.
If <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> had not been whetted with
the Reproaches of the Baron <HI>D' Offkirk,</HI> and &s;ome
of the other General Officers, I believe it had
&s;aved the Lives of a 1000 Men; for when all was
thus lo&s;t, &s;everal Officers advi&s;ed him to make
a Retreat with &s;uch Regiments as he had yet un|broken;
but nothing could per&s;wade him to
&s;tir a Foot: But turning his Flank into a Front,
he &s;aluted the Enemy as they pa&s;s'd by him in
Pur&s;uit of the re&s;t, with &s;uch terrible Volleys of
&s;mall Shot, as co&s;t them the Lives of Abundance of
their Men.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="142">
The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> eager in the Pur&s;uit, left him
unbroken, till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Brigade came up and
charged him: The&s;e he bravely repul&s;ed with
a great Slaughter, and after them a Body of
Dragoons; till being laid at on every Side, and
mo&s;t of his Men killed, the brave old General,
with all the re&s;t who were left, were made Pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> had a terrible Lo&s;s here; for almo&s;t
all their Infantry were killed or taken Pri&s;oners.
<HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> refu&s;ed Quarter &s;everal times; and
&s;till tho&s;e that attacked him were cut down by
his Men, who fought like Furies, and by the
Example of their General, behaved them&s;elves
like Lions. But at la&s;t, the&s;e poor Remains
of a Body of the brave&s;t Men in the World were
forced to &s;ubmit. I have heard him &s;ay, he had
much rather have died than been taken, but
that he yeilded in Compa&s;&s;ion to &s;o many brave
Men as were about him; for none of them would
take Quarter till he gave his Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>I had the wor&s;t Share in this Battle that ever
I had in any Action of my Life; and that was
to be po&s;ted among as brave a Body of Hor&s;e as
any in <HI>Germany,</HI> and yet not be able to &s;uccour
our own Men; but our Foot were cut in Pieces
(as it were) before our Faces; and the Situation
of the Ground was &s;uch as we could not fall in.
All that we were able to do, was to carry off about
2000 of the Foot, who running away in the Rout
of the Left Wing, rallied among our Squadrons,
and got away with us. Thus we &s;tood till we &s;aw
all was lo&s;t, and then made the be&s;t Retreat we
could to &s;ave our &s;elves, &s;everal Regiments ha|ving
never charged, nor fired a Shot; for the
Foot had &s;o embara&s;&s;ed them&s;elves among the
Lines and Works of the Enemy, and in the Vine|yards
<PB N="137" REF="143">
and Mountains, that the Hor&s;e were ren|dered
ab&s;olutely un&s;erviceable.</P>
<P>The Rhinegrave had made &s;uch Expedition
to join us, that he reached within three Miles
of the Place of Action that Night, and he was a
great Sa&s;eguard for us in rallying our di&s;per&s;ed
Men, who el&s;e had fallen into the Enemy's
Hands, and in checking the Pur&s;uit of the
Enemy.</P>
<P>And indeed, had but any con&s;iderable Body
of the Foot made an orderly Retreat, it had been
very probable they had given the Enemy a Bru&s;h
that would have turned the Scale of Victory;
for our Hor&s;e being whole, and in a manner un|touched,
the Enemy found &s;uch a Check in the
Pur&s;uit, that 1600 of their forwarde&s;t Men fol|lowing
too eagerly, fell in with the Rhinegrave's
advanced Troops the next Day, and were cut in
Pieces without Mercy.</P>
<P>This gave us &s;ome Satisfaction for the Lo&s;s, but
it was but &s;mall compared to the Ruin of that
Day. We lo&s;t near 8000 Men upon the Spot,
and above 3000 Pri&s;oners, all our Cannon and
Baggage, and 120 Colours. I thought I never
made &s;o indifferent a Figure in my Life, and &s;o we
thought all; to come away, lo&s;e our Infantry, our
General, and our Honour, and never fight for
it. Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> was utterly di&s;con&s;olate for
old <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn;</HI> for he concluded him killed;
he tore the Hair from his Head like a mad Man,
and telling the Rhinegrave the Story of the
Council of War, would reproach him&s;elf with
not taking his Advice, often repeating it in his
Pa&s;&s;ion, 'Tis <HI>I,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>have been the Death of the
brave&s;t General</HI> in Germany; would call him&s;elf
Fool and Boy, and &s;uch Names, for not liftening
to the Rea&s;ons of an old experienced Soldier. But
<PB N="138" REF="144">
when he heard he was alive in the Enemy's
Hands, he was the ea&s;ier, and applied him&s;elf to
the recruting his Troops, and the like Bu&s;ine&s;s
of the War; and it was not long before he paid
the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> with Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I returned to <HI>Frankfort au Main</HI> after this
Action, which happened the 17th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1634;
but the Progre&s;s of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> was &s;o great,
that there was no &s;taying at <HI>Frankfort.</HI> The
Chancellor <HI>Oxen&s;tern</HI> removed to <HI>Magdeburg,</HI>
Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> and the Landgrave marched into
<HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> carried all before
them, for all the re&s;t of the Campaign: They
took <HI>Philipsburgh</HI> by Surprize; they took <HI>Ausburgh</HI>
by Famine, <HI>Spire</HI> and <HI>Treves</HI> by Sieges, taking
the Elector Pri&s;oner. But this Succe&s;s did one
Piece of Service to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> that it brought the
<HI>French</HI> into the War on their Side; for the Ele|ctor
of <HI>Treves</HI> was their Confederate. The <HI>French</HI>
gave the Conduct of the War to Duke <HI>Barnard.</HI>
This, though the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> fell off, and
fought again&s;t them, turned the Scale &s;o much in
their Favour, that they recovered their Lo&s;&s;es,
and proved a Terror to all <HI>Germany.</HI> The farther
Accounts of the War I refer to the Hi&s;tories of
tho&s;e Times, which I have &s;ince read with a
great deal of Delight.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, when I &s;aw the Progre&s;s of the <HI>Imperial</HI>
Army after the Battle of <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> turning his Arms again&s;t them,
I thought their Affairs declining; and giving
them over for lo&s;t, I left <HI>Frankfort,</HI> and came
down the Rhine to <HI>Cologn,</HI> and from thence into
<HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>I came to the <HI>Hague</HI> the 8th of <HI>March</HI> 1635,
having &s;pent three Years and a half in <HI>Germany</HI>
and the greate&s;t Part of it in the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="145">
I &s;pent &s;ome Time in <HI>Holland</HI> viewing the won|derful
Power of Art which I ob&s;erved in the For|tifications
of their Towns, where the very
Ba&s;tions &s;tand on bottomle&s;s Mora&s;&s;es, and yet
are as firm as any in the World. There I had
the Opportunity to &s;ee the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army, and their
famous General Prince <HI>Maurice.</HI> 'Tis true, the
Men behaved them&s;elves well enough in Action,
when they were put to it, but the Prince's
way of beating his Enemies without Fighting,
was &s;o unlike the Gallantry of my Royal In|&s;tructer,
that it had no manner of Reli&s;h with
me. Our way in <HI>Germany</HI> was always to &s;eek
out the Enemy and fight him; and, give the <HI>Impe|riali&s;ts</HI>
their due, they were &s;eldom hard to be
found, but were as free of their Fle&s;h as we
were.</P>
<P>Whereas Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> would lye in a Camp
till he &s;tarved half his Men, if by lying there he
could but &s;tarve two Thirds of his Enemies; &s;o
that indeed the War in <HI>Holland</HI> had more of
Fatigues and Hard&s;hips in it, and ours had
more of Fighting and Blows: Ha&s;ty Marches,
long and unwhole&s;ome Encampments, Winter
Parties, Counter-marching, Dodging, and En|trenching,
were the Excerci&s;es of his Men, and
often times killed him more Men with Hunger,
Cold, and Di&s;ea&s;es, than he could do with Fight|ing:
Not that it required le&s;s Courage, but rather
more; for a Soldier had at any time rather die
in the Field <HI>a la Coup de Mou&s;quet,</HI> than be &s;tar|ved
with Hunger, or frozen to Death in the
Trenches.</P>
<P>Nor do I think I le&s;&s;en the Reputation of that
Great General; for tis mo&s;t certain he ruined
the <HI>Spaniard</HI> more by &s;pinning the War thus out
in Length, than he could po&s;&s;ibly have done by
<PB N="140" REF="146">
a &s;wift Conque&s;t: For had he, <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> like,
with a Torrent of Victory di&s;lodged the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
of all the 12 Provinces in 5 Years, whereas he
was 40 Years, a beating them out of 7, he had
left them rich and &s;trong at Home, and able
to keep them in con&s;tant Apprehen&s;ions of a
Return of his Power: Whereas, by the long
Continuance of the War, he &s;o broke the very
Heart of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, &s;o ab&s;olutely and
irrecoverably impoveri&s;hed them, that they have
ever &s;ince langui&s;hed of the Di&s;ea&s;e, till they
are fallen from the mo&s;t powerful, to be the mo&s;t
de&s;picable Nation in the World.</P>
<P>The prodigious Charge the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was
at in lo&s;ing the Seven Provinces, broke the very
Spirit of the Nation; and that &s;o much, that all
the Wealth of their <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mountains have not
been able to retrieve it; King <HI>Philip</HI> having of|ten
declared, that War, be&s;ides his Armada for
invading <HI>England,</HI> had co&s;t him 370 Millions
of Ducats, and 4000000 of the be&s;t Soldiers
in <HI>Europe;</HI> whereof, by an unrea&s;onable <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Ob&s;tinacy, above Sixty Thou&s;and lo&s;t their Lives
before <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> a Town not worth a &s;ixth Part,
either of the Blood or Money it co&s;t in a Siege
of three Years; and which at la&s;t he had never
taken, but that Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> thought it not
worth the Charge of defending it any longer.</P>
<P>However, I &s;ay, their Way of fighting in <HI>Hol|land</HI>
did not reli&s;h with me at all. The Prince
lay a long time before a little Fort called <HI>Shenk|&s;cans,</HI>
which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> took by Surprize, and
I thought he might have taken it much &s;ooner.
Perhaps it might be my Mi&s;take; but I fancied
my Heroe, the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> would have carried
it Sword in Hand, in Half the Time.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="147">
However it was, I did not like it; &s;o in the
latter End of the Year I came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and
took Shipping for <HI>England,</HI> where I arrived, to
the great Satisfaction of my Father and all my
Friends.</P>
<P>My Father was then in <HI>London,</HI> and carried
me to ki&s;s the King's Hand. His Maje&s;ty was
plea&s;ed to received me very well, and to &s;ay a
great many very obliging things to my Father
upon my Account.</P>
<P>I &s;pent my Time very retired from Court, for
I was almo&s;t wholly in the Country; and it be|ing
&s;o much different from my Genius, which
hankered after a warmer Sport than Hunting
among our <HI>Welch</HI> Mountains, I could not but be
peeping in all the foreign Accounts from <HI>Germany,</HI>
to &s;ee who and who was together. There I could
never hear of a Battle, and the <HI>Germans</HI> being
beaten, but I began to wi&s;h my &s;elf there. But
when an Account came of the Progre&s;s of <HI>John Ban|nier,</HI>
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General in <HI>Saxony,</HI> and of the con|&s;tant
Victories he had there over the <HI>Saxons,</HI> I could
no longer contain my &s;elf, but told my Father
this Life was very di&s;agreeable to me; that I lo&s;t
my Time here, and might to much more
Advantage go into <HI>Germany,</HI> where I was &s;ure I
might make my Fortune upon my own
Terms: That, as young as I was, I might have
been a General Officer by this Time, if I had not
laid down my Commi&s;&s;ion: That General <HI>Ban|nier,</HI>
or the Mar&s;hal <HI>Horn,</HI> had either of them &s;o
much Re&s;pect for me, that I was &s;ure I might
have any thing of them: And that if he plea&s;ed
to give me Leave, I would go for <HI>Germany</HI> again.
My Father was very unwilling to let me go, but
&s;eeing me unea&s;y, told me, that if I was re&s;olv'd,
<PB N="142" REF="148">
he would oblige me to &s;tay no longer in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
than the next Spring, and I &s;hould have his
Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Winter following began to look very un|plea&s;ant
upon us in <HI>England,</HI> and my Father u&s;ed
often to &s;igh at it; and would tell me &s;ometimes,
he was afraid we &s;hould have no need to &s;end
<HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> to fight in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The Cloud that &s;eemed to threaten mo&s;t was
from <HI>Scotland.</HI> My Father, who had made him|&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of the Arguments on both Sides,
u&s;ed to be often &s;aying, he feared there was &s;ome
about the King who exa&s;perated him too much
again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> and drove things too high.
For my part, I confe&s;s I did not much trouble
my Head with the Cau&s;e; but all my Fear was,
they would not fall out, and we &s;hould have no
Fighting. I have often reflected &s;ince, that I
ought to have known better, that had &s;een how
the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Provinces of <HI>Germany</HI> were
reduced to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Condition that
ever any Country in the World was, by the
Ravagings of Soldiers, and the Calamities of
War.</P>
<P>How much &s;oever I was to blame, yet &s;o it
was, I had a &s;ecret Joy at the News of the
King's rai&s;ing an Army, and nothing could have
with-held me from appearing in it; but my
Eagerne&s;s was anticipated by an Expre&s;s the
King &s;ent to my Father, to know if his Son was
in <HI>England;</HI> and my Father having ordered me
to carry the An&s;wer my &s;elf, I waited upon his
Maje&s;ty with the Me&s;&s;enger. The King received
me with his u&s;ual Kindne&s;s, and asked me if I
was willing to &s;erve him again&s;t the <HI>Scots?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wered, I was ready to &s;erve him again&s;t
any that his Maje&s;ty thought fit to account his
<PB N="143" REF="149">
Enemies, and &s;hould count it an Honour to re|ceive
his Commands. Hereupon his Maje&s;ty of|fered
me a Commi&s;&s;ion. I told him, I &s;uppo&s;ed
there would not be much Time for rai&s;ing of
Men; that if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed I would be
at the Rendezvous with as many Gentlemen
as I could get together, to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty as
Voluntiers.</P>
<P>The Truth is, I found all the Regiments of
Hor&s;e the King de&s;igned to rai&s;e, were but two,
as Regiments; the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e were &s;uch
as the Nobility rai&s;ed in their &s;everal Counties,
and commanded them them&s;elves; and, as I had
commanded a Regiment of Hor&s;e abroad, it look|ed
a little odd to &s;erve with a &s;ingle Troop at
home; and the King took the thing pre&s;ently. <HI>In|deed
'twill be a Voluntier War,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>for the
Northern Gentry have &s;ent me an Account of above
4000 Hor&s;e they have already.</HI> I bowed, and told
his Maje&s;ty I was glad to hear his Subjects were
&s;o forward to &s;erve him; &s;o taking his Maje&s;ty's
Orders to be at <HI>York</HI> by the End of <HI>March,</HI> I re|turned
to my Father.</P>
<P>My Father was very glad I had not taken a
Commi&s;&s;ion, for I know not from what kind of
Emulation between the We&s;tern and Northern
Gentry. The Gentlemen of our Side were not
very forward in the Service; their Loyalty to
the King in the &s;ucceeding Times made it ap|pear
it was not from any Di&s;affection to his Ma|je&s;ty's
Intere&s;t or Per&s;on, or to the Cau&s;e; but
this however made it difficult for me when I
came home, to get any Gentleman of Quality to
&s;erve with me, &s;o that I pre&s;ented my &s;elf to
his Maje&s;ty only as a Voluntier, with eight Gen|tlemen,
and about 36 Countrymen well mounted
and armed.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150">
And as it proved, the&s;e were enough, for this
Expedition ended in an Accomodation with the
<HI>Scots;</HI> and they not advancing &s;o much as to
their own Borders, we never came to any Acti|on;
but the Armies lay in the Counties of
<HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> eat up the Country,
and &s;pent the King a va&s;t Sum of Money, and
&s;o this War ended, a Pacification was made, and
both Sides returned.</P>
<P>The Truth is, I never &s;aw &s;uch a de&s;picable
Appearance of Men in Arms to begin a War, in
my Life; whether it was that I had &s;een &s;o
many braver Armies abroad that prejudiced me
again&s;t them, or that it really was &s;o; for to
me they &s;eemed little better than a Rabble met
together to devour, rather than fight for their
King and Country. There was indeed a great
Appearance of Gentlemen, and tho&s;e of extraor|dinary
Quality; but their Garb, their Equipages,
and their Mein, did not look like War; their
Troops were filled with Footmen and Servants,
and wretchedly armed, God wot. I believe I
might &s;ay, without Vanity, one Regiment of <HI>Fin|land</HI>
Hor&s;e would have made Sport at beating them
all. There were &s;uch Crouds of Par&s;ons, (for this
was a Church War in particular) that the Camp
and Court was full of them; and the King was
&s;o eternally be&s;ieged with Clergymen of one &s;ort
or another, that it gave Offence to the chief of
the Nobility.</P>
<P>As was the Appearance, &s;o was the Service;
the Army marched to the Borders, and the Head
Quarter was at <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed;</HI> but the <HI>Scots</HI>
never appeared, no, not &s;o much as their Scouts;
whereupon the King called a Council of War,
and there it was re&s;olved to &s;end the Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI> with a Party of Hor&s;e into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to
<PB N="145" REF="151">
learn &s;ome News of the Enemy; and truly the
fir&s;t News he brought us was, that finding their
Army encamped about <HI>Coldingham,</HI> 15 Miles from
<HI>Berwick,</HI> as &s;oon as he appeared, the <HI>Scots</HI> drew
Out a Party to charge him, upon which mo&s;t of
his Men halted, I don't lay run away, but 'twas
next Door to it; for they could not be per&s;wa|ded
to fire their Pi&s;tols, and wheel off like Sol|diers,
but retreated in &s;uch a di&s;orderly and
&s;hameful Manner, that had the Enemy but had
either the Courage or Conduct to have followed
them, it mu&s;t have certainly ended in the Ruin
of the whole Party.</P>

<P>_I Confe&s;s, when I went into Arms at the
Begining of this War, I never troubled

to hear the Drums beat for Soldiers;
as if I had been a meer <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> that had not

Bu&s;ine&s;s, as the meane&s;t Wretch that li&s;ted in the
Army; nor had I the lea&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate Thought
for the Mi&s;eries of my native Country, 'till after
the Fight at <HI>Edgehill.</HI> I had known as much, and
perhaps more than mo&s;t in the Army, what it
was to have an Enemy ranging in the Bowels of a
Kingdom; I had &s;een the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Pro|vinces
of <HI>Germany</HI> reduced to perfect De&s;arts, and
the voracious <HI>Crabats,</HI> with inhuman Barbarity,
quenching the Fires of the plundered Villages
with the Blood of the Inhabitants. Whether
this had hardened me again&s;t the natural Tender|ne&s;s
which I afterwards found return upon me,
or not, I cannot tell; but I reflected upon my
&s;elf afterwards with a great deal of Trouble, for
the Unconcernedne&s;s of my Temper at the ap|proaching
Ruin of my native Country.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="153">
I was in the fir&s;t Army at <HI>York,</HI> as I have al|ready
noted, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, had the lea&s;t
Diver&s;ion there that ever I found in an Army in
my Life; for when I was in <HI>Germany</HI> with the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> we u&s;ed to &s;ee the King with the
General Officers every Morning on Hor&s;eback,
viewing his Men, his Artillery, his Hor&s;es, and
always &s;omething going forward: Here we &s;aw
nothing but Courtiers and Clergymen, Bi&s;hops and
Par&s;ons, as bu&s;y as if the Direction of the War had
been in them; the King was &s;eldom &s;een among us,
and never without &s;ome of them always about him.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e few of us that had &s;een the Wars, and
would have made a &s;hort End of this for him,
began to be very unea&s;y; and particularly a cer|tain
Nobleman took the Freedom to tell the
King, that the Clergy would certainly ruin the Ex|pedition;
<HI>the Ca&s;e was this</HI> he would ha' had the King
have immediately marched into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and put
the Matter to the Trial of a Battle; and he urged it
every Day; and the King finding his Rea&s;ons
very good, would often be of his Opinion; but
next Morning he would be of another Mind.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was a Man of Conduct enough,
and of unque&s;tioned Courage, and afterwards lo&s;t
his Life for the King. He &s;aw we had an Army
of young &s;tout Fellows, numerous enough; and
tho' they had not yet &s;een much Service, he was
for bringing them to Action, that the <HI>Scots</HI> might
not have time to &s;trengthen them&s;elves; nor they
have time by Idlene&s;s and Sotting, <HI>the Bane of
Soldiers,</HI> to make them&s;elves unfit for any thing.</P>
<P>I was one Morning in Company with this Gen|tleman;
and as he was a warm Man, and eager
in his Di&s;cour&s;e, a Pox of the&s;e Prie&s;ts, &s;ays he,
'tis for them the King has rai&s;ed this Army, and
<PB N="148" REF="154">
put his Friends to a va&s;t Charge; and now we
are come, they won't let us fight.</P>
<P>But I was afterwards convinced, the Clergy
&s;aw farther into the Matter than we did; they
&s;aw the <HI>Scots</HI> had a better Army than we had;
bold and ready, commanded by brave Officers;
and they fore&s;aw, that if we fought, we &s;hould
be beaten, and if beaten, they were undone. And
'twas very true, we had all been ruined, if we
had engaged.</P>
<P>It is true, when we came to the Pacification which
followed, I confe&s;s I was of the &s;ame Mind the Gen|tleman
had been of; for we had better have fought,
and been beaten, than have made &s;o di&s;honoura|ble
a Treaty, without &s;triking a Stroke. This
Pacification &s;eems to me to have laid the Scheme
of all the Blood and Confu&s;ion which followed in
the Civil War; for whatever the King and his
Friends might pretend to do by talking big, the <HI>Scots</HI>
&s;aw he was to be bullied into any thing, and that
when it came to the Pu&s;h, the Courtiers never
cared to bring it to Blows.</P>
<P>I have little or nothing, to &s;ay as to Action, in
this Mock-Expedition. The King was per&s;waded
at la&s;t to march to <HI>Berwick;</HI> and as I have &s;aid al|ready,
a Party of Hor&s;e went out to learn News
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and as &s;oon as they &s;aw them, run
away from them, bravely.</P>
<P>This made the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;o in&s;olent, that whereas
before they lay encamped behind a River, and
never &s;hewed them&s;elves, in a &s;ort of mode&s;t
Deference to their King, which was the Pretence
of not being Aggre&s;&s;ors or Invaders, only arming
in their own Defence; now, having been inva|ded
by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops entring <HI>Scotland,</HI> they
had what they wanted: And to &s;hew it was not
Fear that re&s;trained them before, but Policy, now
<PB N="149" REF="155">
they came up in Parties to our very Gates, bra|ving,
and facing us every Day.</P>
<P>I had, with more Curio&s;ity than Di&s;cretion,
put my &s;elf as a Voluntier at the Head of one of
our Parties of Hor&s;e, under my Lord <HI>Holland,</HI> when
they went out to di&s;cover the Enemy; they went,
they &s;aid, to &s;ee what the <HI>Scots</HI> were a-doing.</P>
<P>We had not marched far, but our Scouts
brought Word, they had di&s;covered &s;ome Hor&s;e,
but could not come up to them, becau&s;e a River
parted them. At the Heels of the&s;e came another
Party of our Men upon the Spur to us, and &s;aid
the Enemy was behind, which might be true,
for ought we knew; but it was &s;o far behind,
that no Body could &s;ee them; and yet the Coun|try
was plain and open for above a Mile before us:
Hereupon we made a Halt, and indeed I was a|fraid
'twould have been an odd Sort of a Halt;
for our Men began to look one upon another,
as they do in like Ca&s;es, when they are go|ing
to break; and when the Scouts came gallo|ping
in, the Men were in &s;uch Di&s;order, that had
but one Man broke way, I am &s;atisfied they had
all run for it.</P>
<P>I found my Lord <HI>Holland</HI> did not perceive it;
but after the fir&s;t Surprize was a little over, I told
my Lord what I had ob&s;erved; and that unle&s;s
&s;ome Cour&s;e was immediately taken, they would
all run at the fir&s;t Sight of the Enemy. I found
he was much concerned at it, and began to con&s;ult
what Cour&s;e to take, to prevent it. I confe&s;s 'tis
a hard Que&s;tion, how to make Men &s;tand and face
an Enemy, when Fear has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their Minds
with an Inclination to run away: But I'll give
that Honour to the Memory of that noble Gen|tleman,
who tho' his Experience in Matters of
War was &s;mall, having never been in much Ser|vice;
<PB N="150" REF="156">
yet his Courage made amends for it; for
I dare &s;ay he would not have turned his Hor&s;e
from an Army of Enemies, nor have &s;aved his
Life at the Price of running away for it.</P>
<P>My Lord &s;oon &s;aw, as well as I, the Fright the
Men were in, after I had given him a Hint of it;
and to encourage them, rode thro' their Ranks,
and &s;poke chearfully to them, and u&s;ed what Ar|guments
he thought proper to &s;ettle their Minds
I remembred a Saying which I had heard old
Mar&s;hal <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn</HI> &s;peak in <HI>Germany,</HI> If you
find your Men faulter, or in Doubt, never &s;uffer
them to halt, but keep them advancing; for while
they are going forward, it keeps up their Courage.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I could get Opportunity to &s;peak
to him, I gave him this as my Opinion. That's very
well, &s;ays my Lord, but I am &s;tudying, &s;ays he, to
po&s;t them &s;o as that they can't run if they would;
and if they &s;tand but once to face the Enemy, I
do'nt fear them afterwards.</P>
<P>While we were di&s;cour&s;ing thus, Word was
brought, that &s;everal Parties of the Enemies were
&s;een on the farther Side of the River, upon which
my Lord gave the Word to march, and as we
were marching on, my Lord calls out a Lieute|nant
who had been an old Soldier, with only five
Troopers whom he had mo&s;t Confidence in; and
having given him his Le&s;&s;on, he &s;ends him away;
in a Quarter of an Hour, one of the five Troopers
comes back galloping and hallowing, and tells us
his Lieutenant had with his &s;mall Party beaten
a Party of 20 of the Enemy's Hor&s;e over the River,
and had &s;ecured the Pa&s;s, and de&s;ired my Lord
would march up to him immediately.</P>
<P>'Tis a &s;trange thing that Mens Spirits &s;hould
be &s;ubjected to &s;uch &s;udden Changes, and capa|ble
of &s;o much Alteration from Shadows of things.
<PB N="151" REF="157">
They were for running before they &s;aw the Ene|my;
now they are in ha&s;te to be led on, and but
that in raw Men we are obliged to bear with any
thing, the Di&s;order in both was intolerable.</P>
<P>The Story was a premeditated Sham, and not
a Word of Truth in it, invented to rai&s;e their
Spirits, and cheat them out of their cowardly
flegmatick Apprehen&s;ions, and my Lord had his
End in it; for they were all on Fire to fall on:
And I am per&s;waded, had they been led immedi|ately
into a Battle begun to their Hands, they
would have laid about them like Furies; for there
is nothing like Victory to flu&s;h a young Soldier.
Thus while the Humour was high, and the Fer|mentation
la&s;ted, away we marched; and pa&s;&s;ing
one of their great Commons which they call <HI>Moors,</HI>
we came to the River, as he called it, where our
Lieutenant was po&s;ted with his four Men; 'twas
a little Brook fordable with Ea&s;e, and leaving
a Guard at the Pa&s;s, we advanced to the Top of a
&s;mall A&s;cent, from whence we had a fair View
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, as they lay behind another
River larger than the former.</P>
<P>Our Men were po&s;ted well enough, behind a
&s;mall Enclo&s;ure, with a narrow Lane in their
Front: And my Lord had cau&s;ed his Dragoons
to be placed in the Front to line the Hedges;
and in this Po&s;ture he &s;tood viewing the Enemy
at a Di&s;tance. The <HI>Scots</HI> who had &s;ome Intelli|gence
of our coming, drew out three &s;mall Parties,
and &s;ent them by different Ways to ob&s;erve our
Number; and forming a fourth Party, which I
gue&s;&s;ed to be about 600 Hor&s;e, advanced to the
Top of the Plain, and drew up to face us, but ne|ver
offered to attack us.</P>
<P>One of the &s;mall Parties making about 100 Men,
one third Foot pa&s;&s;es upon our Flank in View,
<PB N="152" REF="158">
but out of reach; and as they marched, &s;houted
at us, which our Men better plea&s;ed with that
Work than with Fighting, readily enough an|&s;wered,
and would fain have fired at them for the
Plea&s;ure of making a Noi&s;e; for they were too
far off to hit them.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that the&s;e Parties had always &s;ome
Foot with them; and yet if the Hor&s;e galloped,
or pu&s;hed on ever &s;o forward, the Foot were as
forward as they, which was an extraordinary
Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus</HI> that King of Soldiers, was the
fir&s;t that I have ever ob&s;erved found the Advan|tage
of mixing &s;mall Bodies of Mu&s;queteers a|mong
his Hor&s;e; and had he had &s;uch nimble
&s;trong Fellows as the&s;e, he would have prized
them above all the re&s;t of his Men. The&s;e were
tho&s;e they call <HI>Highlanders;</HI> they would run on
Foot with their Arms, and all their Acoutre|ments,
and keep very good Order too, and yet
keep Pace with the Hor&s;e, let them go at what
Rate they would. When I &s;aw the Foot thus in|terlined
among the Hor&s;e, together with the Way
of ordering their flying Parties, it pre&s;ently oc|curred
to my Mind, that here was &s;ome of our
old <HI>Scots,</HI> come home out of <HI>Germany,</HI> that had the
ordering of Matters; and if &s;o, I knew we were
not a Match for them.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;tood facing the Enemy 'till our Scouts
brought us Word the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Army was in
Motion, and in full march to attack us; and
though it was not true, and the Fear of our Men
doubled every Object, yet 'twas thought conve|nient
to make our Retreat. The whole Matter
was, that the Scouts having informed them what
they could, of our Strength; the 600 were ordered
<PB N="153" REF="159">
to march towards us, and three Regiments of
Foot were drawn out to &s;upport the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>I know not whether they would have ventured
to attack us, at lea&s;t before their Foot had come
up; but whether they would have put it to the
Hazard or no, we were re&s;olved not to hazard
the Trial, &s;o we drew down to the Pa&s;s; and, as re|treating
looks &s;omething like running away,
e&s;pecially when an Enemy is at hand, our Men
had much a-do to make there Retreat pa&s;s for a
March, and not a Flight; and, by their often
looking behind them, any Body might know
what they would have done if they had been
pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I was heartily a&s;hamed when the <HI>Scots</HI>
coming up to the Place where we had been po&s;ted,
&s;tood and &s;houted at us. I would have per|&s;waded
my Lord to have charged them, and he
would have done it with all his Heart, but he
&s;aw it was not practicable; &s;o we &s;tood at gaze
with them above 2 Hours, by which time their
Foot were come up to them, and yet they
did not offer to attack us. I never was &s;o a&s;hamed
of my &s;elf in my Life; we were all di&s;pirited,
the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen would come out &s;ingle, with|in
Shot of our Po&s;t, which in a time of War is
always accounted a Challenge to any &s;ingle Gen|tleman,
to come out and exchange a Pi&s;tol with
them, and no Body would &s;tir; at la&s;t our old
Lieutenant rides out to meet a <HI>Scotchman</HI> that
came pickeering on his Quarter. This Lieute|nant
was a brave and a &s;trong Fellow, had been
a Soldier in the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> and though he
was not of any Quality, only a meer Soldier,
had his Preferment for his Conduct. He gallops
bravely up to his Adver&s;ary, and exchanging
their Pi&s;tols, the Lieutenant's Hor&s;e happened
<PB N="154" REF="160">
to be killed. The <HI>Scotchman</HI> very generou&s;ly di&s;|mounts,
and engages him with his Sword, and
fairly ma&s;ters him, and carries him away Pri|&s;oner;
and I think this Hor&s;e was all the Blood
was &s;hed in that War.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant's Name thus conquered was
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and as he was a very &s;tout old Soldier, the
Di&s;grace of it broke his Heart. The <HI>Scotchman</HI>
indeed u&s;ed him very generou&s;ly; for he treated
him in the Camp very courteou&s;ly, gave him
another Hor&s;e, and &s;et him at Liberty, <HI>gratis.</HI>
But the Man laid it &s;o to Heart, that he never
would appear in the Army, but went home to
his own Country and died.</P>
<P>I had enough of Party-making, and was quite
&s;ick with Indignation at the Cowardi&s;e of the
Men; and my Lord was in as great a Fret as I,
but there was no Remedy; we dur&s;t not go about to
retreat, for we &s;hould have been in &s;uch Confu|&s;ion,
that the Enemy mu&s;t have di&s;covered it:
So my Lord re&s;olved to keep the Po&s;t, if po&s;|&s;ible,
and &s;end to the King for &s;ome Foot. Then
were our Men ready to fight with one another
who &s;hould be the Me&s;&s;enger; and at la&s;t when
a Lieutenant with 20 Dragoons was di&s;patched,
he told us afterwards he found him&s;elfan Hundred
&s;trong before he was gotten a Mile from the
Place.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, as &s;oon as ever the Day declined, and
the Dusk of the Evening began to &s;helter the
De&s;igns of the Men, they dropt away from us
one by one; and at la&s;t in &s;uch Numbers, that if
we had &s;tayed till the Morning, we had not
had 50 Men left, out of 1200 Hor&s;e and
Dragoons.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw how 'twas, con&s;ulting with &s;ome
of the Officers, we all went to my Lord <HI>Holland,</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="161">
and pre&s;&s;ed him to retreat, before the Enemy
&s;hould di&s;cern the Flight of our Men; &s;o he drew
us off, and we came to the Camp the next Mor|ning,
in the &s;hamefulle&s;t Condition that ever poor
Men could do. And this was the End of the wor&s;t
Expedition ever I made in my Life.</P>
<P>To fight and be beaten, is a Ca&s;ualty common
to a Soldier, and I have &s;ince had enough of it;
but to run away at the Sight of an Enemy, and
neither &s;trike or be &s;tricken, this is the very
Shame of the Profe&s;&s;ion, and no Man that has
done it, ought to &s;hew his Face again in the
Field, unle&s;s Di&s;advantages of Place or Number
make it tolerable, neither of which was our
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Holland</HI> made another March a few
Days after, in hopes to retrieve this Mi&s;carriage;
but I had enough of it, &s;o I kept in my Quarters:
And though his Men did not de&s;ert him as before,
yet upon the Appearance of the Enemy, they
did not think fit to fight, and came off with but
little more Honour than they did before.</P>
<P>There was no need to go out to &s;eek the Enemy
after this; for they came, as I have noted, and
pitched in Sight of us, and their Parties came
up every Day to the very Out-works of <HI>Berwick;</HI>
but no Body cared to meddle with them: And
in this Po&s;ture things &s;tood when the Pacifi|cation
was agreed on by both Parties; which, like
a &s;hort Truce, only gave both Sides Breath to
prepare for a new War more ridiculou&s;ly ma|naged
than the former. When the Treaty was &s;o
near a Conclu&s;ion, as that Conver&s;ation was ad|mitted
on both Sides, I went over to the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Camp to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity, as many of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers did al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="162">
I confe&s;s, the Soldiers made a very uncouth
Figure, e&s;pecially the <HI>Highlanders:</HI> The Oddne&s;s
and Barbarity of their Garb and Arms &s;eemed
to have &s;omething in it remarkable.</P>
<P>They were generaly tall &s;winging Fellows; their
Swords were extravagantly, and I think in&s;ignifi|cantly
broad, and they carried great wooden Tar|gets
large enough to cover the upper part of their
Bodies. Their Dre&s;s was as antique as the re&s;t; a
at Cap on their Heads, called by them a Bonnet,
long hanging Sleeves behind, and their Doublet,
Breeches and Stockings, of a Stuff they called
Plaid, &s;triped a-cro&s;s red and yellow, with &s;hort
Cloaks of the &s;ame. The&s;e Fellows looked, when
drawn out, like a Regiment of <HI>Merry Andrews</HI>
ready for <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair. They are in Companies
all of a Name, and therefore call one another
only by their Chri&s;tian Names, as <HI>Jemy, Jockey,</HI>
that is <HI>John;</HI> and <HI>Sawny,</HI> that is, <HI>Alexander,</HI> and the
like. And they &s;corn to be commanded but by
one of their own Clan or Family. They are
all Gentlemen, and proud enough to be Kings.
The meane&s;t Fellow among them is as tenacious
of his Honour, as the be&s;t Nobleman in the Coun|try,
and they will fight, and cut one another's
Throats for every trifling Affront.</P>
<P>But to their own Clans or Lairds, they are the
willinge&s;t and mo&s;t obedient Fellows in Nature.
Give them their due, were their Skill in Excer|ci&s;es
and Di&s;cipline proportioned to their Cou|rage,
they would make the brave&s;t Soldiers in
the World. They are large Bodies, and pro|digiou&s;ly
&s;trong; and two Qualities they have
above other Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> hardy to endure Hunger,
Cold, and Hard&s;hips, and wonderfully &s;wift of
Foot. The latter is &s;uch an Advantage in the
Field, that I know none like it; for if they con|quer,
<PB N="157" REF="163">
no Enemy can e&s;cape them; and if they
run, even the Hor&s;e can hardly overtake them.
The&s;e were &s;ome of them, who, as I ob&s;erved
before, went out in Parties with their Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>There were three or four Thou&s;and of the&s;e in
the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, armed only with Swords and
Targets; and in their Belts &s;ome of them had a
Pi&s;tol, but no Mu&s;quets at that time among them.</P>
<P>But there were al&s;o a great many Regiments
of di&s;ciplined Men, who by their carrying their
Arms, looked as if they under&s;tood their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and by their Faces, that they dur&s;t &s;ee
an Enemy.</P>
<P>I had not been Half an Hour in their Camp,
after the Ceremony of giving our Names, and
pa&s;&s;ing their Out-Guards and Main Guard was
over, but I was &s;aluted by &s;everal of my Acquain|tance;
and in particular, by one who led the
<HI>Scotch</HI> Voluntiers at the Taking the Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Openheim,</HI> of which I have given an Account.
They u&s;ed me with all the Re&s;pect they thought
due to me, on Account of old Affairs, gave me
the Word, and a Sergeant waited upon me when|ever
I plea&s;ed to go abroad.</P>
<P>I continued 12 or 14 Days among them, till
the Pacification was concluded; and they were
ordered to march home. They &s;poke very re|&s;pectfully
of the King, but I found were exa&s;pe|rated
to the la&s;t Degree at Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> and
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, for endeavouring to impo&s;e
the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI> upon them; and they
always talked with the utmo&s;t Contempt of our
Soldiers and Army. I always waved the Di&s;|cour&s;e
about the Clergy, and the Occa&s;ion of
the War; but I could not but be too &s;en&s;ible
what they &s;aid of our Men was true; and by
this I perceived they had an univer&s;al Intelligence
<PB N="158" REF="164">
from among us, both of what we were doing,
and what &s;ort of People we were that were do|ing
it; and they were mighty de&s;irous of com|ing
to Blows with us. I had an Invitation from
their General, but I declined it, le&s;t I &s;hould give
Offence. I found they accepted the Pacification
as a thing not likely to hold, or that they
did not de&s;ign &s;hould hold; and that they were
re&s;olved to keep their Forces on Foot, notwith|&s;tanding
the Agreement. Their whole Army
was full of brave Officers, Men of as much Ex|perience
and Conduct as any in the World; and all
Men who know any thing of the War, know
good Officers pre&s;ently make a good Army.</P>
<P>Things being thus huddled up, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came
back to <HI>York,</HI> were the Army &s;eparated, and the
<HI>Scots</HI> went home to encrea&s;e theirs; for I ea&s;ily
fore&s;aw, that Peace was the farthe&s;t thing from
their Thoughts.</P>
<P>The next Year the Flame broke out again,
the King draws his Forces down into the North,
as before, and Expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent to all the Gen|tlemen
that had Commands, to be at the Place
by the 15th of <HI>July.</HI> As I had accepted of no
Command in the Army, &s;o I had no Inclination
at all to go; for I fore&s;aw there would be no|thing
but Di&s;grace attend it. My Father ob|&s;erving
&s;uch an Alteration in my u&s;ual Forward|ne&s;s,
asked me one Day, what was the Matter,
that I, who u&s;ed to be &s;o forward to go into the
Army, and &s;o eager to run abroad to fight, now
&s;hewed no Inclination to appear when the Ser|vice
of the King and Country called me to it? I
told him, I had as much Zeal as ever for the
King's Service, and for the Country too: But
he knew a Soldier could not abide to be beaten;
and being from thence a little more inqui&s;itive,
<PB N="159" REF="165">
I told him the Ob&s;ervations I had made in the
<HI>Scots</HI> Army, and the People I had conver&s;ed with
there; and, Sir, &s;ays I, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, if the
King offers to fight them, he will be beaten; and
I don't love to engage, when my Judgement tells
me before-hand, I &s;hall be wor&s;ted: And as I
had fore&s;een, it came to pa&s;s; for the <HI>Scots</HI> re|&s;olving
to proceed, never &s;tood upon the Cere|mony
of Aggre&s;&s;ion, as before, but on the 20th
of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> they entered <HI>England</HI> with their
Army.</P>
<P>However, as my Father de&s;ired, I went to the
King's Army, which was then at <HI>York,</HI> but not
gotten all together: The King him&s;elf was at
<HI>London;</HI> but upon this News takes Po&s;t for the
Army, and advancing a Part of his Forces, he
po&s;ted the Lord <HI>Conway</HI> and Sir <HI>Jacob A&s;tley,</HI>
with a Brigade of Foot and &s;ome Hor&s;e at <HI>New|born,</HI>
upon the River <HI>Tine,</HI> to keep the <HI>Scots</HI> from
pa&s;&s;ing that River.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> could have pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tine</HI> without
Fighting; but to let us &s;ee that they were able
to force their Pa&s;&s;age, they fall upon this Body
of Men; and notwith&s;tanding all the Advan|tages
of the Place, they beat them from the Po&s;t,
took their Baggage and two Pieces of Cannon,
with &s;ome Pri&s;oners. Sir <HI>Jacob A&s;tley</HI> made what
Re&s;i&s;tance he could; but the <HI>Scots</HI> charged with
&s;o much Fury, and being al&s;o over-powered, he
was &s;oon put into Confu&s;ion. Immediately the
<HI>Scots</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and
the next Day of <HI>Durham,</HI> and laid tho&s;e two
Counties under intolerable Contributions.</P>
<P>Now was the King ab&s;olutely ruined; for
among his own People the Di&s;contents before
were &s;o plain, that had the Clergy had any
Foreca&s;t, they would never have embroiled him
<PB N="160" REF="166">
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> till he had fully brought Matters
to an Under&s;tanding at Home: But the Ca&s;e was
thus: The King, by the good Husbandry of
Bi&s;hop <HI>Juxon,</HI> his Trea&s;urer, had a Million of ready
Money in his Trea&s;ury, and upon that Account
having no need of a Parliament, had not called
one in 12 Years; and perhaps had never called
another, if he had not by this unhappy Circum|&s;tance
been reduced to a Nece&s;&s;ity of it; for now
this ready Money was &s;pent in two fooli&s;h Ex|peditions,
and his Army appeared in a Condi|tion
not fit to engage the <HI>Scots;</HI> the Detatch|ment
under Sir <HI>Jacob A&s;tley,</HI> which were of the
Flower of his Men, had been routed at <HI>Newborn,</HI>
and the Enemy had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two entire
Counties.</P>
<P>All Men blamed <HI>Laud</HI> for prompting the King
to provoke the <HI>Scots,</HI> a head&s;trong Nation, and
zealous for their own Way of Wor&s;hip; and
<HI>Laud</HI> him&s;elf found too late the Con&s;equences of
it, both to the whole Cau&s;e and to him&s;elf;
for the <HI>Scots,</HI> who&s;e native Temper is not ea&s;ily to
forgive an Injury, pur&s;ued him by their Party
in <HI>England,</HI> and never gave it over, till they
laid his Head on the Block.</P>
<P>The ruined Country now clamoured in his
Maje&s;ty's Ears with daily Petitions, and the
Gentry of other Neighbour Counties cry
out for Peace and a Parliament. The King, em|bara&s;&s;ed
with the&s;e Difficulties, and quite em|pty
of Money, calls a Great Council of the No|bility
at <HI>York,</HI> and demands their Advice, which
any one could have told him before, would be
to call a Parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot, without Regret, look back upon the
Misfortune of the King, who, as he was one of
the be&s;t Princes in his per&s;onal Conduct that
<PB N="161" REF="167">
ever reigned in <HI>England,</HI> had yet &s;ome of the
greate&s;t Unhappine&s;&s;es in his Conduct as a King,
that ever Prince had, and the whole Cour&s;e of
his Life demon&s;trated it.</P>
<P>1. An impolitick Hone&s;ty. His Enemies cal|led
it Ob&s;tinacy: But as I was per&s;ectly ac|quainted
with his Temper, I cannot but think
it was his Judgment, when he thought he was
in the right to adhere to it as a Duty tho' again&s;t
his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>2. Too much Compliance when he was com|plying.</P>
<P>No Man but him&s;elf would have denied what
at &s;ometimes he denied, and have granted what
at other times he granted; and this Uncer|tainty
of Coun&s;el proceeded from two things.</P>
<P>1. The Heat of the Clergy, to whom he was
exceedingly devoted, and for whom indeed he
ruined him&s;elf.</P>
<P>2. The Wi&s;dom of his Nobility.</P>
<P>Thus when the Coun&s;el of his Prie&s;ts prevai|led,
all was Fire and Fury; the <HI>Scots</HI> were Re|bels,
and mu&s;t be &s;ubdued; and the Parlia|ment's
Demands were to be rejected as exor|bitant;
but whenever the King's Judgment was
led by the grave and &s;teady Advice of his No|bility
and Coun&s;ellors, he was always enclined
by them to temperate his Mea&s;ures between
the two Extremes: And had he gone on in
&s;uch a Temper, he had never met with the
Misfortunes which afterward attended him, or
had &s;o many Thou&s;ands of his Friends lo&s;t their
Lives and Fortunes in his Service.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, we that knew what it was to fight
for him, and that loved him better than any of
the Clergy could pretend to, have had many a
Con&s;ultation how to bring over our Ma&s;ter from
<PB N="162" REF="168">
&s;o e&s;pou&s;ing their Intere&s;t, as to ruin him&s;elf for
it; but 'twas in vain.</P>
<P>I took this Interval, when I &s;at &s;till and only
looked on, to make the&s;e Remarks, becau&s;e I re|member
the be&s;t Friends the King had were at
this time of that Opinion. That 'twas an unac|countable
Piece of Indi&s;cretion, to commence a
Quarrel with the <HI>Scots,</HI> a poor and ob&s;tinate Peo|ple,
for a Ceremony and Book of Church Di&s;ci|pline,
at a time when the King &s;tood but upon
indifferent Terms with his People at Home.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence was, it put Arms into the
Hands of his Subjects to rebel again&s;t him; it
embroiled him with his Parliament in <HI>England,</HI>
to whom he was fain to &s;toop in a fatal and unu|&s;ual
Manner to get Money, all his own being
&s;pent, and &s;o to buy off the <HI>Scots</HI> whom he cou'd
not beat off.</P>
<P>I cannot but give one In&s;tance of the unaccoun|table
Politicks of his Mini&s;ters. If they over|ruled
this unhappy King to it, with De&s;ign to ex|hau&s;t
and impoveri&s;h him, they were the wor&s;t
of Traytors; if not, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of Fools. They
prompted the King to equip a Fleet again&s;t the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and to put on board it 5000 Land Men.
Had this been all, the De&s;ign had been good, that
while the King had faced the Army upon the
Borders, the&s;e 5000 landing in the Frith of <HI>Edin|burgh</HI>
might have put that whole Nation into Di&s;|order.
But in Order to this, they advi&s;e the
King to lay out his Money in fitting out the big|ge&s;t
Ships he had, and the Royal Sovereign, the
bigge&s;t Ship the World had ever &s;een, which
co&s;t him no le&s;s than 100000 Pounds was now
built, and fitted out for this Voyage.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t incongruous and ridiculous
Advice that could be given, and made us all be|lieve
<PB N="163" REF="169">
we were betrayed, tho' we knew not
by whom.</P>
<P>To fit out Ships of 100 Guns to invade <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which had not one Man of War in the World, nor
any open Confederacy with any Prince or State
that had any Fleet! 'twas a mo&s;t ridiculous thing.
An Hundred Sail of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Colliers, to carry the
Men with their Stores and Provi&s;ions, and ten Fri|gates
of 40 Guns each, had been as good a Fleet
as Rea&s;on, and the Nature of the thing could ha'
made tolerable.</P>
<P>Thus things were carried on, 'till the King,
beggar'd by the Mi&s;management of his Coun&s;els,
and beaten by the <HI>Scots,</HI> was driven to the Nece&s;&s;ity
of calling a Parliament in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my De&s;ign to enter into the Feuds and
Brangles of this Parliament. I have noted, by Ob|&s;ervations
of their Mi&s;takes, who brought the
King to this unhappy Nece&s;&s;ity of calling them.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty had tried Parliaments upon &s;eve|ral
Occa&s;ions before, but never found him&s;elf &s;o
much embroiled with them but he could &s;end
them Home, and there was an End of it; but as
he could not avoid Calling the&s;e, &s;o they took
Care to put him out of a Condition to di&s;mi&s;s
them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Army was now quartered upon the
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The Counties, the Gentry, and the
A&s;&s;embly of Lords at <HI>York,</HI> petitioned for a Par|liament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> pre&s;ented their Demands to the King,
in which it was ob&s;erved, that Matters were con|certed
between them and a Party in <HI>England;</HI> and
I confe&s;s, when I &s;aw that, I began to think the
King in an ill Ca&s;e; for as the <HI>Scots</HI> pretended Grie|vances,
we thought, the King redre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e
Grievances, they could ask no more; and there|fore
<PB N="164" REF="170">
all Men advi&s;ed the King to grant their full
Demands. And whereas the King had not Mo|ney
to &s;upply the <HI>Scots</HI> in their March home, I know
there were &s;everal Meetings of Gentlemen with a
De&s;ign to advance con&s;iderable Sums of Money
to the King to &s;et him free, and in order to rein|&s;tate
his Maje&s;ty, as before. Not that we ever ad|vi&s;ed
the King to rule without a Parliament, but
we were very de&s;irous of putting him out of the
Nece&s;&s;ity of calling them, at lea&s;t, ju&s;t then.</P>
<P>But the Eighth Article of the <HI>Scots</HI> Demands ex|pre&s;ly
required, That an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament might
be called to remove all Ob&s;tructions of Commerce,
and to &s;ettle Peace, Religion and Liberty; and
in another Article they tell the King, the 24th
of <HI>September</HI> being the Time his Maje&s;ty appointed
for the Meeting of the Peers, will make it too
long e'er the Parliament meet.</P>
<P>And in another, That a Parliament was the only
Way of &s;ettling Peace, and bringing them to his
Maje&s;ty's Obedience.</P>
<P>When we &s;aw this in the Army, 'twas time to
look about. Every body perceived that the <HI>Scots</HI>
Army would call an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament; and what|ever
Aver&s;ion the King had to it, we all &s;aw he
would be obliged to comply with it; and now
they all began to &s;ee their Error, who advi&s;ed
the King to this <HI>Scotch</HI> War.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, the A&s;&s;em|bly
of the Peers meet at <HI>York;</HI> and by their Ad|vice
a Treaty was begun with the <HI>Scots.</HI> I had
the Honour to be &s;ent with the fir&s;t Me&s;&s;age which
was in Writing.</P>
<P>I brought it, attended with a Trumpet, and a
Guard of 500 Hor&s;e, to the <HI>Scots</HI> Quarters. I was
&s;toped at <HI>Darlington,</HI> and my Errand being
known, General <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> &s;ent a <HI>Scots</HI> Major and 50
<PB N="165" REF="171">
Hor&s;e, to receive me, but would let neither my
Trumpet or Guard &s;et Foot within their Quar|ters.
In this Manner, I was conducted to Audi|ence
in the Chapter-Hou&s;e at <HI>Durham,</HI> where a
Committee of <HI>Scots</HI> Lords who attended the Ar|my,
received me very courteou&s;ly, and gave me
their An&s;wer in Writing al&s;o.</P>
<P>'Twas in this An&s;er that they &s;hewed at lea&s;t
to me their De&s;ign of embroiling the King with
his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects; they di&s;cour&s;ed very freely
with me, and did not order me to withdraw when
they debated their private Opinions: They drew
up &s;everal An&s;wers but did not like them; at la&s;t,
they gave me one which I did not receive; I
thought it was too in&s;olent to be born with, as
near as I can remember, it was thus.</P>
<P><HI>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of</HI> Scotland <HI>attending the Service
in the Army, do refu&s;e any Treaty in the City of</HI> York.</P>
<P>One of the Commi&s;&s;ioners who treated me with
more Di&s;tinction than the re&s;t, and di&s;cour&s;ed
freely with me, gave me an Opportunity to
&s;peak more freely of this than I expected.</P>
<P>I told them, if they would return to his Ma|je&s;ty
an An&s;wer fit for me to carry, or if they
would &s;ay they would not treat at all, I would
deliver &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age: But I entreated them to
con&s;ider the An&s;wer was to their Sovereign, and
to whom they made a great Profe&s;&s;ion of Duty
and Re&s;pect; and at lea&s;t they ought to give their
Rea&s;ons, why they declined a Treaty at <HI>York;</HI>
and to name &s;ome other Place, or humbly to de|&s;ire
his Maje&s;ty to name &s;ome other Place: But to
&s;end Word they would not treat at <HI>York,</HI> I could
deliver no &s;uch Me&s;&s;age, for when put into <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
it would &s;ignify, they would not treat at all.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed a great many Rea&s;ons and Arguments
with them on this Head: And at la&s;t, with &s;ome Dif|ficulty,
<PB N="166" REF="172">
obtained of them to give the Rea&s;on, which
was the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s having the chief Com|mand
at <HI>York,</HI> whom they declared their mortal E|nemy,
he having declared them Rebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>With this An&s;wer I returned. I could make
no Ob&s;ervation in the &s;hort time I was with them;
for as I &s;taid but one Night, &s;o I was guarded as
a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner all the while. I &s;aw &s;everal of
their Officers whom I knew, but they dur&s;t not
&s;peak to me; and if they would ha' ventured,
my Guard would not ha' permitted them.</P>
<P>In this Manner I was conducted out of their
Quarters to my own Party again, and having
delivered my Me&s;&s;age to the King, and told his
Maje&s;ty the Circum&s;tances, I &s;aw the King re|ceive
the Account of the haughty Behaviour of the
<HI>Scots</HI> with &s;ome Regret; however it was his Ma|je&s;ty's
time now to bear, and therefore the <HI>Scots</HI>
were comply'd with, and the Treaty appointed
at <HI>Rippon;</HI> where, after much Debate, &s;everal
preliminary Articles were agreed on, as a Ce&s;&s;a|tion
of Arms, <HI>Quarters and Bounds to the Armies,
Sub&s;i&s;tence to the</HI> Scots <HI>Army,</HI> and the Re&s;idue of the
Demands was referred to a Treaty at <HI>London, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We were all amazed at the Treaty, and I cannot
but remember we u&s;ed to wi&s;h much rather we had
been &s;uffered to fight; for tho' we had been wor|&s;ted
at fir&s;t, the Power and Strength of the King's
Intere&s;t which was not yet tried, mu&s;t, in fine,
ha' been too &s;trong for the <HI>Scots:</HI> Whereas now we
&s;aw the King was for complying with any thing,
and all his Friends would be ruined.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I had nothing to fear, and &s;o was not
much concerned; but our Predictions &s;oon came
to pa&s;s: For no &s;ooner was this Parliament called,
but Abundance of tho&s;e who had embroiled their
King with his People of both Kingdoms, like the
<PB N="167" REF="173">
Di&s;ciples, when their Ma&s;ter was $etrayed to the
<HI>Jews, for&s;ook him and fled;</HI> and now Parliament
Tyranny began to &s;ucceed Church Tyranny, and
we Soldiers were glad &s;ee it at fir&s;t: The Bi&s;hops
trembled, the Judges went to Goal; the Officers
of the Co&s;toms were laid hold on; and the Par|liament
began to lay their Fingers on the great
ones, particularly Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> and the Earl
of <HI>Strafford.</HI> We had no great Concern for the
fir&s;t, but the la&s;t was a Man of &s;o much Conduct
and Gallantry, and &s;o beloved by the Soldiers and
principal Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> that every Body was
touched with his Misfortune.</P>
<P>The Parliament now grew mad in their Turn,
and as the Pro&s;perity of any Party is the time to
&s;hew their Di&s;cretion, the Parliament &s;hewed
they knew as little where to &s;top as other People.
The King was not in a Condition to deny any
thing, and nothing could be demanded but they
pu&s;h'd it. They attainted the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and
thereby made the King cut off his right Hand, to
&s;ave his left, and yet not &s;ave it neither&punc; They ob|tain
another Bill, to empower them to &s;it during
their own Plea&s;ure, and after them, Triennial Par|liaments
to meet, whether the King call them or no;
and Granting this compleated his Maje&s;ty's Ruin.</P>
<P>Had the Hou&s;e only regulated the Abu&s;es of
the Court, puni&s;hed evil Coun&s;ellours, and re&s;tor'd
Parliaments to their original and ju&s;t Powers, all
had been well; and the King, tho' he had been
more than mortified, had yet reaped the Benefit
of future Peace; for now the <HI>Scots</HI> were &s;ent Home,
after having eaten up two Counties, and received
a prodigious Sum of Money to boot: And the
King, tho' too late, goes in Per&s;on to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and grants them all they could de&s;ire, and more
<PB N="168" REF="174">
than they asked; but in <HI>England,</HI> the De&s;ires of
ours were unbounded, and drove at all Extremes.</P>
<P>They threw out the Bi&s;hops from &s;itting in the
Hou&s;e, make a Prote&s;tation equivalent to the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Covenant; and this done, print their Remon|&s;trance.
This &s;o provoked the King, that he
re&s;olves upon &s;eizing &s;ome of the Members, and
in an ill Hour enters the Hou&s;e in Per&s;on to take
them. Thus one imprudent thing on one Hand
produced another of the other Hand, 'till the
King was obliged to leave them to them&s;elves,
for fear of being mobbed into &s;omething or other
unworthy of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e Proceedings began to alarm the Gentry
and Nobility of <HI>England;</HI> for however willing we
were to have evil Coun&s;ellours removed, and the
Government return to a &s;ettled and legal Cour&s;e,
according to the happy Con&s;titution of this Na|tion,
and might ha' been forward enough to have
owned the King had been mi&s;led, and impo&s;ed up|on
to do things which he had rather had not been
done; yet it did not follow, that all the Powers
and Prerogatives of the Crown &s;hould devolve
upon the Parliament, and the King in a Manner
be depo&s;ed, or el&s;e &s;acrificed to the Fury of the
Rabble.</P>
<P>The Heats of the Hou&s;e running them thus to
all Extremes, and at la&s;t to take from the King
the Power of the Militia, which indeed was all
that was left to make him any thing of a King,
put the King upon oppo&s;ing Force with Force;
and thus the Flame of Civil War began.</P>
<P>However backward I was in engaging in the
&s;econd Year's Expedition again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> I was
as forward now; for I waited on the King at <HI>York,</HI>
where a gallant Company of Gentlemen as ever
were &s;een in <HI>England,</HI> engaged them&s;elves to en|ter
<PB N="169" REF="175">
into his Service; and here &s;ome of us formed our
&s;elves into Troops for the Guard of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The King having been waited upon by the
Gentry of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and having told them his Re|&s;olution
of erecting his Royal Standard, and re|ceived
from them hearty A&s;&s;urances of Support;
di&s;mi&s;&s;es them, and marches to <HI>Hull,</HI> where lay
the Train of Artillery, and all the Arms and A|munition
belonging to the <HI>Northern</HI> Army which
had been disbanded. But here the Parliament
had been before-hand with his Maje&s;ty, &s;o that
when he came to <HI>Hull,</HI> he found the Gates &s;hut,
and Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> the Governour upon the
Walls, tho' with a great deal of &s;eeming Humility
and Prote&s;tations of Loyalty to his Per&s;on, yet with
a po&s;itive Denial to admit any of the King's At|tendants
into the Town. If his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed
to enter the Town in Per&s;on with any rea&s;ona|ble
Number of his Hou&s;hould, he would &s;ub|mit,
but would not be prevailed on to receive
the King, as he would be received, with his
Forces, tho' tho&s;e Forces were then but very few.</P>
<P>The King was exceedingly provoked at this
Repul&s;e, and indeed it was a great Surprize to
us all; for certainly never Prince began a War
again&s;t the whole Strength of his Kingdom,
under the Circum&s;tances that he was in. He had
not a Garri&s;on, or a Company of Soldiers in
his Pay, not a Stand of Arms, or a Barrel of
Powder, a Mu&s;quet, Cannon or Mortar, not
a Ship of all the Fleet, or Money in his Trea|&s;ury
to procure them; whereas the Parliament
had all his Navy, and Ordinance, Stores, Maga|zines,
Arms, Ammunition, and Revenue, in their
Keeping. And this I take to be another Defect
of the King's Coun&s;el, and a &s;ad In&s;tance of the
Di&s;traction of his Affairs; that when he &s;aw how
<PB N="170" REF="176">
all things were going to wreck, as it was im|po&s;&s;ible
but he &s;hould &s;ee it, and 'tis plain he
did &s;ee it, that he &s;hould not long enough before
it came to Extremities, &s;ecure the Navy, Maga|zines,
and Stores of War, in the Hands of his
tru&s;ty Servants that would have been &s;ure to
have pre&s;erved them for his U&s;e, at a Time
when he wanted them.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, but the Gentry of
<HI>England,</HI> who generally pre&s;erved their Loyalty
for their Royal Ma&s;ter, and at la&s;t heartily
&s;hewed it, were exceedingly di&s;couraged at
fir&s;t, when they &s;aw the Parliament had an the
Means of making War in their own Hands, and
the King was naked and de&s;titute either of Arms,
or Ammunition, or Money to procure them.</P>
<P>Not but that the King, by extraordinary Ap|plication,
recovered the Di&s;order the Want of
the&s;e things had thrown him into, and &s;upplied
him&s;elf with all things needful.</P>
<P>But my Ob&s;ervation was this, had his Ma|je&s;ty
had the Magazines, Navy, and Forts in his
own Hand, the Gentry, who wanted but the
Pro&s;pect of &s;omething to encourage them, had
come in at fir&s;t, and the Parliament being un|provided,
would have been pre&s;ently reduced
to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But this was it that baulked the Gentry of
<HI>York&s;hire,</HI> who went home again, giving the King
good Promi&s;es, but never appeard for him till
by rai&s;ing a good Army in <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI>
he marched towards <HI>London,</HI> and they &s;aw there
was a Pro&s;pect of their being &s;upported.</P>
<P>In this Condition the King erected his Stan|dard
at <HI>Nottingham, Augu&s;t</HI> the 22d 1642, and,
I confe&s;s, I had very melancholy Apprehen&s;ions
of the King's Affairs; for the Appearance to
<PB N="171" REF="177">
the Royal Standard was but &s;mall. The Affront
the King had met with at <HI>Hull,</HI> had baulked and
di&s;pirited the Northern Gentry, and the King's
Affairs looked with a very di&s;mal A&s;pect. We
had Expre&s;&s;es from <HI>London</HI> of the prodigious
Succe&s;s of the Parliament's Levies, how their
Men came in fa&s;ter than they could entertain
them, and that Arms were delivered out to whole
Companies li&s;ted together, and the like: And
all this while the King had not got together a
Thou&s;and Foot, and had no Arms for them
neither. When the King &s;aw this, he immediately
di&s;patches $ive &s;everal Me&s;&s;engers, whereof one
went to the Marque&s;s of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> into <HI>Wales;</HI>
one went to the Queen, then at <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> one to
the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> then Marque&s;s of <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI>
into the <HI>North;</HI> one into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and one
into <HI>France,</HI> where the Queen &s;oon after arrived
to rai&s;e Money, and buy Arms, and to get what
A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he could among her own Friends:
Nor was her Maje&s;ty idle, for &s;he &s;ent over
&s;everal Ships laden with Arms and Ammunition,
with a fine Train of Artillery, and a great many
very good Officers; and though one of the fir&s;t
fell into the Hands of the Parliament, with 300
Barrels of Powder and &s;ome Arms, and 150 Gen|tlemen,
yet mo&s;t of the Gentlemen found Means,
one Way or other, to get to us, and mo&s;t of the
Ships the Queen freighted arrived; and at la&s;t
her Maje&s;ty came her &s;elf, and brought an extra|ordinary
Supply, both of Men, Money, Arms, &amp;c.
with which &s;he joined the King's Forces under
the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> in the <HI>North.</HI> Finding his
Maje&s;ty thus be&s;tirring him&s;elf to mu&s;ter his
Friends together, I ask'd him, if he thought it
might not be for his Maje&s;ty's Service to let me
go among my Friends, and his loyal Sub$ects
<PB N="172" REF="178">
about <HI>Shrewsbury?</HI> Yes, &s;ays the King, &s;miling, I
intend you &s;hall, and I de&s;ign to go with you
my &s;elf. I did not under&s;tand what the King
meant then, and did not think it good Man|ners
to enquire; but the next Day I found all
things di&s;po&s;ed for a March, and the King on
Hor&s;eback by Eight of the Clock; when calling
me to him, he told me I &s;hould go before, and
let my Father and all my Friends know, he
would be at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> the <HI>Saturday</HI> following. I
left my Equipages, and taking Po&s;t with only
one Servant, was at my Father's the next Morn|ing
by Break of Day. My Father was not &s;ur|prized
at the News of the King's coming at all;
for, it &s;eems, he, together with the loyal Gentry
of tho&s;e Parts, had &s;ent particularly to give the
King an Invitation to move that Way, which I
was not made privy to; with an Account what
Encouragement they had there in the Endea|vours
made for his Intere&s;t. In &s;hort, the whole
Country was entirely for the King, and &s;uch was
the univer&s;al Joy the People &s;hewed when the
News of his Maje&s;ty's coming down was po&s;iti|vely
known, that all Manner of Bu&s;ine&s;s was
laid a&s;ide, and the whole Body of the People
&s;eemed to be re&s;olved upon the War.</P>
<P>As this gave a new Face to the King's Affairs, &s;o
I mu&s;t own it filled me with Joy; for I was
a&s;toni&s;hed before, when I con&s;idered what the
King and his Friends were like to be expo&s;ed
to. The News of the Proceedings of the Par|liament,
and their powerful Preparations were
now no more terrible; the King came at the
Time appointed, and having lain at my Father's
Hou&s;e one Night, entered <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> in the Morn|ing.
The Acclamations of the People, the Con|cour&s;e
of the Nobility and Gentry about his Per|&s;on,
<PB N="173" REF="179">
and the Crouds which now came every Day
in to his Standard, were incredible.</P>
<P>The Loyalty of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentry was not
only worth Notice, but the Power of the Gentry
is extraordinary vi&s;ible in this Matter: The
King, in about &s;ix Weeks time, which was the
mo&s;t of his Stay at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> was &s;upplied with
Money, Arms, Ammunition, and a Train of Ar|tillery,
and li&s;ted a Body of an Army upwards
of 20000 Men.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty &s;eeing the general Alacrity of his
People, immediately i&s;&s;ued out Commi&s;&s;ions, and
form'd Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot; and ha|ving
&s;ome experienced Officers about him, toge|ther
with about 16 who came from <HI>France,</HI> with
a Ship loaded with Arms and &s;ome Field-pieces
which came very &s;ea&s;onably into the <HI>Severn;</HI> the
Men were excerci&s;ed, regularly di&s;ciplined, and
quartered, and now we began to look like
Soldiers. My Father had rai&s;ed a Regiment of
Hor&s;e at his own Charge, and compleated them,
and the King gave out Arms to them from the
Supplies which I mentioned came from Abroad.
Another Party of Hor&s;e, all brave &s;tout Fellows,
and well mounted, came in from <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and
the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> at the Head of them. The
<HI>Welchmen</HI> came in by Droves; and &s;o great was
the Concour&s;e of People, that the King began
to think of Marching, and gave the Command, as
well as the Tru&s;t of Regulating the Army, to the
brave Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> as General of the Foot. The
Parliament General being the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> two
braver men, or two better Officers, were not in
the Kingdom; they had both been old Soldiers,
and had &s;erved together as Voluntiers, in the
<HI>Low Country</HI> Wars, under Prince <HI>Maurice.</HI> They
had been Comrades and Companions Abroad,
<PB N="174" REF="180">
and now came to face one another as Enemies
in the Field.</P>
<P>Such was the Expedition u&s;ed by the King
and his Friends, in the Levies of this fir&s;t Army,
that notwith&s;tanding the wonderful Expedition
the Parliament made, the King was in the Field
before them; and now the Gentry in other Parts
of the Nation be&s;tirred them&s;elves, and &s;iezed
upon, and Garri&s;oned &s;everal con&s;iderable Places
for the King. In the North, the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>
not only Garri&s;oned the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Places,
but even the general Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the North
was for the King, excepting <HI>Hull,</HI> and &s;ome few
Places, which the old Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> had taken
up for the Parliament. On the other Hand,
entire <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and mo&s;t of the We&s;tern Counties
were the King's. The Parliament had their
chief Intere&s;t in the South and Ea&s;tern Part of
<HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Kent, Surry,</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk,
Norfolk, Cambridge, Bedford, Huntington, Hertford,
Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> and the other midland Counties.
The&s;e were called, or &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, the
A&s;&s;ociated Counties, and felt little of the War,
other than the Charges; but the main Support of
the Parliament was the City of <HI>London.</HI> The King
made the Seat of his Court at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which he
cau&s;ed to be regularly fortified. The Lord <HI>Say</HI> had
been here, and had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City for the Ene|my,
and was debating about fortifying it, but came
to no Re&s;olution, which was a very great Over|&s;ight
in them; the Situation of the Place, and
the Importance of it, on many Accounts, to the
City of <HI>London,</HI> con&s;idered; and they would have
retrieved this Error afterwards, but then 'twas
too late; for the King made it the Head Quar|ter,
and received great Supplies and A&s;&s;i&s;tance
from the Wealth of the Colleges, and the Plenty
<PB N="175" REF="181">
of the neighbouring Country. <HI>Abingdon, Walling|ford,
Ba&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> were all Garri&s;oned
and fortified as Outworks to defend this as the
Center. And thus all <HI>England</HI> became the Thea|ter
of Blood, and War was &s;pread into every
Corner of the Country, though as yet there
was no Stroke &s;truck. I had no Command in
this Army; my Father led his own Regiment,
and old as he was, would not leave his royal
Ma&s;ter, and my elder Brother &s;taid at home to
&s;upport the Family. As for me, I node a Voluntier
in the royal Troop of Guards, which may very
well de&s;erve the Title of a royal Troop; for it was
compo&s;ed of young Gentlemen Sons of the Nobi|lity
and &s;ome of the prime Gentry of the Nation,
and I think not a Per&s;on of &s;o mean a Birth or
Fortune as my &s;elf. We reckoned in this Troop
Two and Thirty Lords, or who came afterwards to
be &s;uch, and Eight and Thirty of younger Sons of
the Nobility, five <HI>French</HI> Noblemen, and all the
re&s;t Gentlemen of very good Families and
E&s;tates.</P>
<P>And that I may give the due to their per&s;onal
Valour, many of this Troop lived afterwards to
have Regiments and Troops under their Com|mand,
in the Service of the King; many of them
lo&s;t their Lives for him, and mo&s;t of them
their E&s;tates: Nor did they behave unworthy of
them&s;elves in their fir&s;t &s;hewing their Faces
to the Enemy, as &s;hall be mentioned in its
Place.</P>
<P>While the King remained at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> his
loyal Friends be&s;tirred them&s;elves in &s;everal
Parts of the Kingdom. <HI>Goring</HI> had &s;ecured <HI>Port&s;|mouth;</HI>
but being young in Matters of War, and
not in Time relieved, though the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Hertford</HI> was marching to relieve him, yet he
<PB N="176" REF="182">
was obliged to quit the Place; and &s;hipped him|&s;elf
for <HI>Holland,</HI> from whence he returned with
Relief for the King, and afterwards did very
good Service upon all Occa&s;ions, and &s;o effectu|ally
cleared him&s;elf of the Scandal the ha&s;ty
Surrender of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> had brought upon his
Courage.</P>
<P>The chief Power of the King's Forces lay in
three Places, in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and at <HI>Shrews|bury:</HI>
In <HI>Cornwall,</HI> Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> afterwards Lord
<HI>Hopton;</HI> Sir <HI>Bevil Granvil</HI> and Sir <HI>Nicholas Slam|ming,</HI>
&s;ecured all the Country, and afterwards
&s;pread them&s;elves over <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI>
took <HI>Exeter</HI> from the Parliament, fortified
<HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> and beat Sir <HI>William
Waller</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Roundway Down,</HI> as I &s;hall
touch at more particularly when I come to recite
the Part of my own Travels that Way.</P>
<P>In the <HI>North,</HI> the Marque&s;s of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> &s;ecured
all the Country, Garri&s;oned <HI>York, Scarborough, Car|li&s;le,
Newca&s;tle Pomfret, Leeds,</HI> and all the con&s;i|derable
Places, and took the Field with a very
good Army, though afterwards he proved more
un&s;ucce&s;sful than the re&s;t, having the whole
Power of a Kingdom at his Back, the <HI>Scots</HI> co|ming
in with an Army to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
Parliament; which indeed was the general Turn
of the Scale of the War; for had it not been
for this <HI>Scots</HI> Army, the King had mo&s;t certainly
reduced the Parliament, at lea&s;t to good Terms
of Peace, in two Years time.</P>
<P>The King was the third Article: His Force
at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> I have noted already; the Alacrity
of the Gentry filled him with Hopes, and all
his Army with Vigour, and the 8th of <HI>October</HI> 1642,
his Maje&s;ty gave Orders to march. The Earl
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had &s;pent above a Month after his lea|ing
<PB N="177" REF="183">
<HI>London</HI> (for he went thence the 9th of <HI>Sep|tember</HI>)
in modelling and drawing together his
Forces; his Rendezvous was at St. <HI>Albans,</HI> from
whence he marched to <HI>Northampton, Coventry,</HI> and
<HI>Warwick,</HI> and leaving Garri&s;ons in them, he
comes on to <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> Being thus advanced, he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <HI>Oxford,</HI> as I noted before, <HI>Banbury, Bri|&s;tol,
Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> out of all which
Places, except <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> we drove him back to <HI>Lon|don</HI>
in a very little while.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Biron</HI> had rai&s;ed a very good Party
of 500 Hor&s;e, mo&s;t Gentlemen, for the King,
and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Oxford;</HI> but on the Approach of
the Lord <HI>Say</HI> quitted it, being now but an open
Town, and retreated to <HI>Worce&s;ter:</HI> From whence,
on the Approach of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, he retreated
to the King. And now all things grew ripe
for Action, both Parties having &s;ecured their
Po&s;ts, and &s;ettled their Schemes of the War, ta|ken
their Po&s;ts and Places as their Mea&s;ures
and Opportunities directed, the Field was next
in their Eye, and the Soldiers began to enquire
when they &s;hould fight; for as yet there had
been little or no Blood drawn, and 'twas not
long before they had enough of it; for I believe
I may challenge all the Hi&s;torians in <HI>Europe</HI> to
tell me of any War in the World where, in the
Space of four Years, there were &s;o many pitched
Battles, Sieges, Fights, and Skirmi&s;hes, as in this
War; we never encamped or entrenched, never
fortified the Avenues to our Po&s;ts, or lay fenced
with Rivers and Defiles; here was no Leaguers
in the Field, as at the Story of <HI>Noremberg,</HI> nei|ther
had our Soldiers any Tents, or what they
call heavy Baggage. 'Twas the general Maxim
of this War, Where is the Enemy? Let us go
and fight them: Or, on the other Hand, if the
<PB N="178" REF="184">
Enemy was coming, what was to be done? Why,
what &s;hould be done? Draw out into the Fields,
and fight them. I cannot &s;ay 'twas the Prudence
of the Parties, and had the King fought le&s;s
he had gained more: And I &s;hall remark &s;everal
times, when the Eagerne&s;s of Fighting was the
wor&s;t Coun&s;el, and proved our Lo&s;s. This Bene|fit
however happened in general to the Country,
that it made a quick, though a bloody End, of
the War, which otherwi&s;e had la&s;ted till it
might have ruined the whole Nation.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>October</HI> the King's Army was
in full March, his Maje&s;ty Generali&s;&s;imo, the
Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> General of the Foot, Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> General of the Hor&s;e; and the fir&s;t Action
in the Field was by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and Sir <HI>John
Biron.</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> had brought his Body of 500
Hor&s;e, as I noted already, from <HI>Oxford</HI> to <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter;</HI>
the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> with a &s;trong Party, being
in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and expected
in the Town, Collonel <HI>Sandys,</HI> a hot Man, and
who had more Courage than Judgment, advances
with about 1500 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, with
De&s;ign to beat Sir <HI>John Biron</HI> out of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI>
and take Po&s;t there for the Parliament.</P>
<P>The King had notice that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
de&s;igned for <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was or|dered
to advance with a Body of Hor&s;e and
Dragoons, to face the Enemy, and bring off Sir
<HI>John Biron.</HI> This his Maje&s;ty did to amu&s;e the
Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> that he might expect him that
Way; whereas the King's De&s;ign was to get be|tween
the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army and the City
of <HI>London;</HI> and his Maje&s;ty's End was doubly
an&s;wered; for he not only drew <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> on to <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI>
where he &s;pent more Time than he needed,
but he beat the Party into the Bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="185">
I went Voluntier in this Party, and rid in
my Father's Regiment; for though we really
expected not to &s;ee the Enemy, yet I was tired
with lying &s;till. We came to <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> ju&s;t as
Notice was brought to Sir <HI>John Biron,</HI> that a
Party of the Enemy was on their March for <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI>
upon which the Prince immediately con|&s;ulting
what was to be done, re&s;olves to march
the next Morning, and fight them.</P>
<P>The Enemy, who lay at <HI>Per&s;hore,</HI> about eight
Miles from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and, as I believe, had no
Notice of our March, came on very confidently
in the Morning, and found us fairly drawn up
to receive them: I mu&s;t confe&s;s this was the
blunte&s;t downright Way of making War that
ever was &s;een. The Enemy, who, in all the little
Knowledge I had of War ought to have di&s;covered
our Numbers, and gue&s;&s;ed by our Po&s;ture what
our De&s;ign was, might ea&s;ily have informed
them&s;elves, that we intended to attack them,
and &s;o might have &s;ecured the Advantage of a
Bridge in their Front; but without any Regard
to the&s;e Methods of Policy, they came on at
all Hazards. Upon this Notice, my Father
propo&s;ed to the Prince, to halt for them, and
&s;uffer our&s;elves to be attacked, &s;ince we found
them willing to give us the Advantage: The
Prince approved of the Advice, &s;o we halted
within View of a Bridge, leaving Space enough
on our Front for about half the Number of their
Forces to pa&s;s and draw up; and at the Bridge
was po&s;ted about 50 Dragoons, with Orders
to retire as &s;oon as the Enemy advanced, as if
they had been afraid. On the Right of the
Road was a Ditch, and a very high Bank behind,
where we had placed 300 Dragoons, with Orders
to lye flat on their Faces till the Enemy had
<PB N="180" REF="186">
pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge, and to let fly among them
as &s;oon as our Trumpets &s;ounded a Charge. No
Body but Collonel <HI>Sandys</HI> would have been caught
in &s;uch a Snare; for he might ea&s;ily have &s;een,
that when he was over the Bridge, there was not
Room enough for him to fight in: But the Lord
of Ho&s;ts was &s;o much in their Mouths, <HI>for that was
the Word for that Day,</HI> that they took little heed
how to conduct the Ho&s;t of the Lord to their
own Advantage.</P>
<P>As we expected, they appeared, beat our Dra|goons
from the Bridge, and pa&s;&s;ed it: We &s;tood
firm in one Line with a Re&s;erve, and expected a
Charge; but Collonel <HI>Sandys</HI> &s;hewing a great deal
more Judgment than we thought he was Ma&s;ter of,
extends him&s;elf to the Left, finding the Ground
too &s;treight, and began to form his Men with
a great deal of Readine&s;s and Skill; for by this
time he &s;aw our Number was greater than he ex|pected:
The Prince perceiving it, and fore&s;eeing
that the Stratagem of the Dragoons would be
fru&s;trated by this, immediately charges with
the Hor&s;e, and the Dragoons at the &s;ame time
&s;tanding upon their Feet, poured in their Shot
upon tho&s;e that were pa&s;&s;ing the Bridge: This
Surprize put them into &s;uch Di&s;order, that we
had but little Work with them; for though Col|lonel
<HI>Sandys</HI> with the Troops next him &s;u&s;tained
the Shock very well, and behaved them&s;elves gal|lantly
enough, yet the Confu&s;ion beginning in
their Reer, tho&s;e that had not yet pa&s;&s;ed the
Bridge were kept back by the Fire of the Dra|goons,
and the re&s;t were ea&s;ily cut in Pieces. Collo|nel
<HI>Sandys</HI> was mortally wounded and taken Pri&s;o|ner,
and the Crowd was &s;o great, to get back,
that many pu&s;hed into the Water; and were ra|ther
&s;mothered than drowned. Some of them who
<PB N="181" REF="187">
never came into the Fight, were &s;o frighted, that
they never looked behind them, 'till they came
to <HI>Per&s;hore;</HI> and as we were afterwards informed,
the Life-Guards of the General who had quar|tered
in the Town, left it in Di&s;order enough,
expecting us at the Heels of their Men.</P>
<P>If our Bu&s;ine&s;s had been to keep the Parlia|ment
Army from coming to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> we had a
very good Opportunity to have &s;ecured the Bridge
at <HI>Per&s;hore;</HI> but our De&s;ign lay another Way, as
I have &s;aid, and the King was for drawing <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
on to the <HI>Severn,</HI> in hopes to get behind him, which
fell out accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> &s;purred by this Affront in the Infancy of
their Affairs, advances the next Day, and came
to <HI>Par&s;hore</HI> time enough to be at the Funeral of
&s;ome of his Men; and from thence he advances
to <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>We marched back to <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> extremely plea|&s;ed
with the good Succe&s;s of our fir&s;t Attack; and
our Men were &s;o flu&s;hed with this little Victory,
that it put Vigour into the whole Army. The
Enemy lo&s;t about 3000 Men, and we carried a|way
near 150 Pri&s;oners, with 500 Hor&s;es, &s;ome
Standards and Arms, and among the Pri&s;oners their
Collonel, but he died a little after of his Wounds.</P>
<P>Upon the Approach of the Enemy, <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>
was quitted, and the Forces marched back to
join the King's Army which lay then at <HI>Bridg|north,
Ludlow,</HI> and thereabout. As the King ex|pected,
it fell out; <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> found &s;o much Work at
<HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> to &s;ettle Parliament Quarters, and &s;e|cure
<HI>Bri&s;tol, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> that it gave the
King a full Day's March of him; &s;o the King ha|ving
the Start of him, moves towards <HI>London;</HI> and
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> nettled to be both beaten in Fight, and out|done
in Conduct, decamps, and follows the King.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188">
The Parliament, and the <HI>Londoners</HI> too, were in
a &s;trange Con&s;ternation at this Mi&s;take of their
General; and had the King, who&s;e great Misfor|tune
was always to follow precipitant Advices:
Had the King, I &s;ay, pu&s;hed on his fir&s;t De&s;ign,
which he had formed with very good Rea&s;on,
and for which he had been dodging with <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
eight or ten Days, <HI>viz.</HI> Of marching directly to
<HI>London,</HI> where he had a very great Intere&s;t, and
where his Friends were not yet oppre&s;&s;ed and
impoveri&s;hed, as they were afterwards, he had
turned the Scale of his Affairs: And every Man
expected it; for the Members began to &s;hift for
them&s;elves, Expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent on the Heels of
one another to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to ha&s;ten after
the King, and if po&s;&s;ible to bring him to a Battle.
Some of the&s;e Letters fell into our Hands, and
we might ea&s;ily di&s;cover, that the Parliament
were in the la&s;t Confu&s;ion at the Thoughts of our
coming to <HI>London:</HI> Be&s;ides this, the City was in
a wor&s;e Fright than the Hou&s;e, and the great
moving Men began to go out of Town. In
&s;hort, they expected us, and we expected to come,
but Providence for our Ruine had otherwi&s;e deter|mined
it.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> upon News of the King's March, and
upon Receipt of the Parliament's Letters, makes
long Marches after us, and on the 23d of <HI>October</HI>
reaches the Village of <HI>Keynton</HI> in <HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI>
The King was almo&s;t as far as <HI>Banbury,</HI> and there
calls a Council of War. Some of the old Officers
that fore&s;aw the Advantage the King had, the
Concern the City was in, and the va&s;t Addition
both to the Reputation of his Forces, and the
Encrea&s;e of his Intere&s;t, it would be, if the King
could gain that Point, urged the King to march
on to <HI>London.</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the fre&s;h Collo|nells
<PB N="183" REF="189">
pre&s;&s;ed for Fighting, told the King, it di|&s;pirited
their Men to march with the Enemy at
their Heels; that the Parliament Army was in|feriour
to him by 6000 Men, and fatigued with
ha&s;ty Marching; that their Orders were to fight,
he had nothing to do, but to po&s;t him&s;elf to Ad|vantage,
and receive them to their De&s;truction;
that the Action near <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> had let him know
how ea&s;y it was to deal with a ra&s;h Enemy; and
that 'twas a Di&s;honour for him, who&s;e Forces
were &s;o much &s;uperior, to be pur&s;ued by his
Subjects in Rebellion. The&s;e and the like Argu|ments
prevailed with the King to alter his wi&s;er
Mea&s;ures, and re&s;olve to fight. Nor was this all,
when a Re&s;olution of fighting was taken, that
Part of the Advice which they who were for
fighting gave, as a Rea&s;on for their Opinion, was
forgot, and in&s;tead of halting, and po&s;ting our
&s;elves to Advantage till the Enemy came up,
we were ordered to march back, and meet
them.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o eager was the Prince for fighting,
that when from the Top of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> the Enemy's
Army was de&s;cried in the Bottom between them
and the Village of <HI>Keynton,</HI> and that the Enemy
had bid us Defiance, by di&s;charging three Can|nons,
we accepted the Challenge, and an&s;wering
with two Shot from our Army, we mu&s;t needs
for&s;ake the Advantages of the Hills, which they
mu&s;t have mounted under the Command of our
Cannon, and march down to them into the Plain. I
confe&s;s, I thought here was a great deal more Gal|lantry
than Di&s;cretion; for it was plainly taking an
Advantage out of our own Hands, and puting it
into the Hands of the Enemy. An Enemy that <HI>mu&s;t
fight,</HI> may always be fought with to Advantage.
My old Heroe, the Glorious <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> was
<PB N="184" REF="190">
as forward to fight as any Man of true Valour
mixt with any Policy need to be, or ought to be;
but he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>An Enemy reduced to a Nece&s;&s;ity
of Fighting, is half Beaten.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, we were all but young in the War;
the Souldiers hot and forward, and eagerly
de&s;ired to come to Hands with the Enemy. But
I take the more Notice of it here, becau&s;e the
King in this acted again&s;t his own Mea&s;ures; For
it was the King him&s;elf had laid the De&s;ign of
getting the Start of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and marching to <HI>Lon|don.</HI>
His Friends had invited him thither, and
expected, him and &s;uffered deeply for the Omi&s;&s;i|on;
and yet he gave way to the&s;e ha&s;ty Coun&s;els,
and &s;uffered his Judgment to be over-ruled by
Majority of Voices; an Error, I &s;ay, the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> was never guilty of: For if all the Officers
at a Council of War were of a different Opinion,
yet unle&s;s their Rea&s;ons ma&s;tered his Judgment,
their Votes never altered his Mea&s;ures: But this
was the Error of our good, but unfortunate
Ma&s;ter, three times in this War, and particularly
in two of the greate&s;t Battles of the time, <HI>viz.</HI>
this of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> and that of <HI>Na&s;eby.</HI></P>
<P>The Re&s;olution for Fighting being publi&s;hed
in the Army, gave an univer&s;al Joy to the Soldiers,
who expre&s;&s;ed an extraordinary Ardour for
Fighting. I remember, my Father talking with
me about it, asked me what I Thought of the ap|proaching
Battle: I told him, I Thought the King
had done very well; for at that time I did not con|&s;ult
the Extent of the De&s;ign, and had a mighty
Mind, like other ra&s;h People, to &s;ee it brought to
a Day, which made me an&s;wer my Father as I
did: But &s;aid I, Sir, <HI>I Doubt there will be but indif|ferent
Doings on both Sides, between two Armies both
made up of fre&s;h Men, that have never &s;een any Service.</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="191">
My Father minded little what I &s;poke of that;
but when I &s;eemed plea&s;ed that the King had
re&s;olved to fight, he looked angrily at me, and
told me he was &s;orry I could &s;ee no farther into
things. I tell you, &s;ays he ha&s;tily, <HI>If the King
&s;hould kill, and take Pri&s;oners, this whole Army, Gene|ral
and all, the Parliament will have the Victory; for we
have lo&s;t more by &s;lipping this Opportunity of getting into</HI>
London, <HI>than we &s;hall ever get by ten Battles.</HI> I &s;aw
enough of this afterwards to convince me of the
Weight of what my Father &s;aid, and &s;o did the
King too; but it was then too late, Advantages
&s;lipt in War are never recovered.</P>
<P>We were now in a full March to fight the Earl
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> It was on <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning the 24th of
<HI>October,</HI> 1642, fair Weather over Head, but the
Ground very heavy and dirty. As &s;oon as we
came to the Top of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> we di&s;covered their
whole Army. They were not drawn up, having
had two Miles to march that Morning; but they
were very bu&s;y forming their Lines, and po|&s;ting
the Regiments as they came up. Some of
their Hor&s;e were exceedingly fatigued, having
marched 48 Hours together; and had they been
&s;uffered to follow us three or four Days March
farther, &s;everal of their Regiments of Hor&s;e
would have been quite ruined, and their
Foot would have been rendered un&s;erviceable for
the pre&s;ent. But we had no Patience.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as our whole Army was come to the
Top of the Hill, we were drawn up in Order of
Battle: The King's Army made a very fine Ap|pearance;
and indeed they were a Body of gal|lant
Men as ever appeared in the Field, and as
well furni&s;hed at all Points: The Hor&s;e exceeding
well accoutred, being mo&s;t of them Gentlemen
and Voluntiers; &s;ome whole Regiments &s;erving
<PB N="186" REF="192">
without Pay. Their Hor&s;es very good and fit for
Service as could be de&s;ired. The whole Army
were not above 18000 Men, and the Enemy not
a 1000 over or under, though we had been told
they were not above 12000; but they had been
reinforced with 4000 Men from <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>The King was with the General, the Earl of
<HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> in the Main Battle; Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> com|manded
the Right Wing, and the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Hertford,</HI> the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> and &s;everal other
very good Officers, the Left.</P>
<P>The Signal of Battle being given with two
Cannot Shot, we marched in Order of Battalia
down the Hill, being drawn up in two Lines with
Bodies of Re&s;erve; the Enemy advanced to meet
us much in the &s;ame Form, with this Difference
only, that they had placed their Cannon on their
Right, and the King had placed ours in the Cen|ter,
before, or rather between two great Bri|gades
of Foot. Their Cannon began with us
fir&s;t, and did &s;ome Mi&s;chief among the Dragoons
of our left Wing; but our Officers perceiving
the Shot took the Men, and mi&s;&s;ed the Hor&s;es,
ordered all to alight, and every Man leading his
Hor&s;e, to advance in the &s;ame Order; and this
&s;aved our Men, for mo&s;t of the Enemy's Shot flew
over their Heads. Our Cannon made a terrible
Execution upon their Foot for a Quarter of an
Hour, and put them into great Confu&s;ion, till the
General obliged them to halt, and changed the
Po&s;ture of his Front, marching round a &s;mall
ri&s;ing Ground by which he avoided the Fury of
our Artillery.</P>
<P>By this time the Wings were engaged, the King
having given the Signal of Battle, and ordered
the Right Wing to fall on. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> who as
is &s;aid, commanded that Wing, fell on with &s;uch
<PB N="187" REF="193">
Fury, and pu&s;hed the Left Wing of the Parliament
Army &s;o effectually, that in a Moment he filled
all with Terror and Confu&s;ion: Comi&s;&s;ary General
<HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> a Scochman, a Low Country Soldier, and
an experienced Officer, commanded their Left
Wing; and though he did all that an expert Sol|dier,
and a brave Commander could do, yet
'twas to no Purpo&s;e; his lines were immediately
broken, and all overwhelmed in a trice: Two
Regiments of Foot, whether as Part of the Left
Wing, or on the Left of the Main Body, I know
not, were di&s;ordered by their own Hor&s;e, and
rather trampled to Death by the Hor&s;es, than
beaten by our Men; but they were &s;o entirely
broken and di&s;ordered, that I do not remember
that ever they made one Volley upon our Men;
for their own Hor&s;e running away, and falling
foul on the&s;e Foot, were &s;o vigorou&s;ly followed
by our Men, that the Foot never had a Moment
to rally, or look behind them. The Point of the
left Wing of Hor&s;e were not &s;o &s;oon broken as
the re&s;t, and three Regiments of them &s;tood firm
for &s;ome Time: The dexterous Officers of the
other Regiments taking the Opportunity, ral|lied
a great many of their &s;cattered Men be|hind
them, and pieced in &s;ome Troops with
tho&s;e Regiments; but after two or three Charges,
which a Brigade of our &s;econd Line following
the Prince, made upon them, they al&s;o were
broken with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I remember, that at the great Battle of <HI>Leip|&s;ick,</HI>
the Right Wing of the <HI>Imperialists</HI> having fal|len
in upon the <HI>Saxons</HI> with like Fury to this,
bore down all before them, and beat the <HI>Saxons</HI>
quite out of the Fields; upon which the Soldi|ers
cried, <HI>Victoria, Let us follow. No, no,</HI> &s;aid the
old General <HI>Tilly, let them go, but let us beat the</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="194">
Swedes <HI>too, and then all's our own.</HI> Had Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> taken this Method, and in&s;tead of follow|ing
the Fugitives, who were di&s;per&s;ed &s;o
effectually, that two Regiments would have
&s;ecured them from rallying; I &s;ay, had he fal|len
in upon the Foot, or wheeled to the Left,
and fallen in upon the Rear of the Enemy's Right
Wing of Hor&s;e, or returned to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
Left Wing of our Hor&s;e, we had gained the mo&s;t
ab&s;olute and compleat Victory that could be; nor
had 1000 Men of the Enemy's Army got off: But
this Prince, who was full of Fire, and plea&s;ed
to &s;ee the Rout of the Enemy, pur&s;ued them
quite to the Town of <HI>Keynton,</HI> where indeed he
killed Abundance of their Men, <HI>and &s;ome Time al|&s;o
was lost in plundering the Baggage:</HI> But in the
mean Time, the Glory and Advantage of the Day
was lo&s;t to the King; for the right Wing of the
Parliament Hor&s;e could not be &s;o broken. Sir
<HI>William Balfour</HI> made a de&s;perate Charge upon
the Point of the King's Left; and had it not been
for two Regiments of Dragoons who were plan|ted
in the Re&s;erve, had routed the whole Wing;
for he broke through the fir&s;t Line, and &s;tag|gered
the &s;econd, who advanced to their A&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
but was &s;o warmly received by tho&s;e
Dragoons, who came &s;ea&s;onably in, and gave their
fir&s;t Fire on Hor&s;eback, that his Fury was check|ed,
and having lo&s;t a great many Men, was forced
to wheel about to his own Men; and had the
King had but three Regiments of Hor&s;e at hand,
to have charged him, he had been routed. The re&s;t
of this Wing kept their Ground, and received
the fir&s;t Fury of the Enemy with great Firm|ne&s;s;
after which, advancing in their Turn, they
were once Ma&s;ters of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Cannon.
And here we lo&s;t another Advantage; for if any
<PB N="189" REF="195">
Foot had been at hand to &s;upport the&s;e Hor&s;e, they
had carried off the Cannon, or turned it upon the
main Battle of the Enemy's Foot; but the Foot
were otherwi&s;e engaged. The Hor&s;e on this
Side fought with great Ob&s;tinacy, and Variety of
Succe&s;s a great while. Sir <HI>Philip Stapylton,</HI> who
commanded the Guards of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> be|ing
engaged with a Party of our <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> Ca|valiers,
as we called them, was once in a fair
way to have been cut off by a Brigade of our
Foot, who being advanced to fall on upon the
Parliament's main Body, flanked Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s Hor&s;e
in their way, and facing to the Left, &s;o furiou&s;ly
charged him with their Pikes, that he was obliged
to retire in great Di&s;order, and with the Lo&s;s
of a great many Men and Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>All this while the Foot on both Sides were
de&s;perately engaged, and coming clo&s;e up to
the Teeth of one another with the clubbed Mu&s;|quet
and Pu&s;h of Pike, fought with great Re&s;o|lution,
and a terrible Slaughter on both Sides, gi|ving
no Quarter for a great while; and they
continued to do thus, till, as if they were tired,
and out of Wind, either Party &s;eemed willing
enough to leave off, and take Breath. Tho&s;e
which &s;uffered mo&s;t were that Brigade which had
charged Sir <HI>William Stapylton</HI>'s Hor&s;e, who being
bravely engaged in the Front which the Ene|my's
Foot, were, on the &s;udden, charged again
in Front and Flank, by Sir <HI>William Balfour</HI>'s Hor&s;e,
and di&s;ordered, after a very de&s;perate Defence.
Here the King's Standard was taken, the Stan|dard-bearer,
Sir <HI>Edward Varney,</HI> being killed; but
it was re&s;cued again by Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> and
brought to the King the &s;ame Night, for which
the King Knighted the Captain.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196">
This Brigade of Foot had fought all the Day,
and had not been broken at la&s;t, if any Hor&s;e had
been at Hand to &s;upport them: The Field began
to be now clear, both Armies &s;tood, as it were,
gazing at one another, only the King, having
rallied his Foot, &s;eemed inclined to renew the
Charge, and began to cannonade them, which
they could not return, mo&s;t of their Cannon
being nailed while they were in our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on,
and all the Cannoniers killed or fled, and
our Gunners did Execution upon Sir <HI>William Bal|four</HI>'s
Troops for a good while.</P>
<P>My Father's Regiment being in the Right
with the Prince, I &s;aw little of the Fight, but
the Rout of the Enemy's Left, and we had as
full a Victory there as we could de&s;ire, but &s;pent
too much Time in it; we killed about 2000
Men in that Part of the Action, and having totally
di&s;per&s;ed them, and plundred their Baggage, be|gan
to think of our Fellows when 'twas too late
to help them. We returned however victorious
to the King, ju&s;t as the Battle was over; the King
asked the Prince what News? He told him he could
give his Maje&s;ty a good Account of the Enemy's
Hor&s;e; <HI>ay by G&mdash;d, &s;ays a Gentleman that &s;tood by me,
and of their Carts too.</HI> That word was &s;poken with
&s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Misfortune, and made &s;uch
an Impre&s;&s;ion in the whole Army, that it occa|&s;ioned
&s;ome ill Blood afterwards among us; and
but that the King took up the Bu&s;ine&s;s, it had
been of ill Con&s;equence; for &s;ome Per&s;on who
had heard the Gentleman &s;peak it, informed the
Prince who it was, and the Prince re&s;enting it,
&s;poke &s;omething about it in the hearing of the
Party when the King was pre&s;ent: The Gentle|man
not at all &s;urprized, told his Highne&s;s open|ly,
he had &s;aid the Words; and though he owned
<PB N="191" REF="197">
he had no Di&s;re&s;pect for his Highne&s;s, yet he
could not but &s;ay, if it had not been &s;o, the
Enemy's Army had been better beaten. The
Prince replied &s;omething very di&s;obliging; upon
which the Gentleman came up to the King, and
kneeling, humbly be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to accept
of his Commi&s;&s;ion, and to give him leave to tell
the Prince, that whenever his Highne&s;s plea&s;ed,
he was ready to give him Satisfaction. The Prince
was exceedingly provoked, and as he was very
pa&s;&s;ionate, began to talk very odly, and without
all Government of him&s;elf: The Gentleman, as
hold as he, but much calmer, pre&s;erved his Tem|per,
but maintained his Quarrel; and the King
was &s;o concerned, that he was very much out of
Humour with the Prince about it. However,
his Maje&s;ty upon Con&s;ideration, &s;oon ended the
Di&s;pute, by laying his Commands on them both
to &s;peak no more of it for that Day; and refu|&s;ing
the Comi&s;&s;ion from the Collonel, for he was
no le&s;s, &s;ent for them both next Morning in pri|vate,
and made them Friends again.</P>
<P>But to return to our Story, we came back to
the King timely enough to put the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s
Men out of all Humour of renewing the Fight;
and as I ob&s;erved before, both Parties &s;tood ga|zing
at one another, and our Cannon playing upon
them, obliged Sir <HI>William Balfour</HI>'s Hor&s;e to
wheel off in &s;ome Di&s;order, but they returned us
none again; which, as we afterwards under&s;tood,
was, as I &s;aid before, for want of both Powder
and Gunners; for the Cannoniers and Firemen
were killed, or had quitted their Train in the
Fight, when our Hor&s;e had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their
Artillery; and as they had &s;piked up &s;ome of the
Cannon, &s;o they had carryed away 15 Carriages
of Powder.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="198">
Night coming on, ended all Di&s;cour&s;e of more
fighting; and the King drew off and marched
towards the Hills. I know no other Token of
Victory which the Enemy had, than their lying
in the Field of Battle all Night, which <HI>they did</HI>
for no other Rea&s;on, than that having lo&s;t their
Baggage and Provi&s;ions, they had no where to go;
and which we <HI>did not,</HI> becau&s;e we had good Quar|ters
at Hand.</P>
<P>The Number of Pri&s;oners, and of the &s;lain, were
not very unequal; the Enemy lo&s;t more Men,
we mo&s;t of Quality. Six Thou&s;and Men on both
Sides were killed on the Spot, whereof, when our
Rolls were examined, we mi&s;&s;ed 2500. We lo&s;t
our brave General the old Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> who
was wounded and taken Pri&s;oner, and died of his
Wounds; Sir <HI>Edward Stradling,</HI> Collonel <HI>Lund&s;|ford,</HI>
Pri&s;oners; and Sir <HI>Edward Varney,</HI> and a
great many Gentlemen of Quality &s;lain. On the
other Hand, we carried off Collonel <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Collo|nel
<HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> and the Lord St. <HI>John,</HI> who al&s;o died
of his Wounds; we took five Ammunition Wag|gons,
full of Powder, and brought off about 500
Hor&s;e in the Defeat of the Left Wing, with
18 Standards and Colours, and lo&s;t 17.</P>
<P>The Slaughter of the Left Wing was &s;o great,
and the Flight &s;o effectual, that &s;everal of the
Officers rid clear away, coa&s;ting round, and got
to <HI>London,</HI> where they reported, that the Parlia|ment
Army was entirely defeated, all lo&s;t, killed,
or taken, as if none but them were left alive
to carry the News. This filled them with Con|&s;ternation
for a while; but when other Me&s;&s;en|gers
followed, all was re&s;tored to Quiet again, and
the Parliament cried up their Victory, and
&s;ufficiently mocked God and their General, with
their publick Thanks for it. Truly, as the Fight
<PB N="193" REF="199">
was a Deliverance to them, they were in the
right to give Thanks for it; but as to its being
a Victory, neither Side had much to boa&s;t of, and
they le&s;s a great deal than we had.</P>
<P>I got no Hurt in this Fight; and indeed we of
the Right Wing had but little fighting; I think
I di&s;charged my Pi&s;tols but once, and my Carabin
twice, for we had more Fatigue than Fight; the
Enemy fled, and we had little to do but to fol|low
and kill tho&s;e we could overtake. I &s;poiled
a good Hor&s;e, and got a better from the Enemy
in his Room, and came home weary enough. My
Father lo&s;t his Hor&s;e, and in the Fall was brui&s;ed
in his Thigh by another Hor&s;e, treading on him,
which di&s;abled him for &s;ome Time, and, at his
Reque&s;t, by his Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ent, I commanded
the Regiment in his Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Enemy received a Recruit of 4000 Men
the next Morning; if they had not, I believe they
had gone back towards <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> but, encouraged
by that Reinforcement, they called a Council of
War, and had a long Debate whether they could
attack us again? but notwith&s;tanding their great
Victory, they dur&s;t not attempt it, though this
Addition of Strength made them &s;uperiour to
us by 3000 Men.</P>
<P>The King indeed expected, that when the&s;e
Troops joined them they would advance, and we
were preparing to receive them at a Village
called <HI>Aino,</HI> where the Head Quarter conti|nued
three or four Days; and had they really
e&s;teemed the fir&s;t Day's Work a Victory, as they
called it, they would have done it, but they
thought not good to venture, but march away
to <HI>Warwick,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Coventry.</HI> The King,
to urge them to venture upon him, and come to a
&s;econd Battle&punc; &s;its down before <HI>Banbury,</HI> and takes
<PB N="194" REF="200">
both Town and Ca&s;tle, and two entire Regiments
of Foot, and one Troop of Hor&s;e, quit the Par|liament
Service, and take up their Arms for the
King. This was done almo&s;t before their Faces,
which was a better Proof of a Victory on our
Side, than any they could pretend to. From <HI>Ban|bury</HI>
we marched to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and now all Men
&s;aw the Parliament had made a great Mi&s;take,
<HI>for they were not always in the right any more than we,</HI>
to leave <HI>Oxford</HI> without a Garri&s;on. The King
cau&s;ed new regular Works to be drawn round
it, and &s;even royal Ba&s;tions with Ravelins and
and Out-works, a double Ditch, Counter&s;carp
and Covered Way; all which added to the Ad|vantage
of its Situation, made it a formidable
Place, and from this Time it became our Place
of Arms, and the Center of Affairs on the King's
Side.</P>
<P>If the Parliament had the Honour of the
Field, the King reaped the Fruits of the Victo|ry;
for all this Part of the Country &s;ubmitted to
him: <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army made the be&s;t of their Way
to <HI>London,</HI> and were but in an ill Condition when
they came there, e&s;pecially their Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Parliament, &s;en&s;ible of this, and receiving
daily Accounts of the Progre&s;s we made, began
to cool a little in their Temper, abated of their
fir&s;t Rage, and voted an Addre&s;s for Peace; and
&s;ent to the King, to let him know they were
de&s;irous to prevent the Effu&s;ion of more Blood,
and to bring things to an Accommodation, or, as
they called it, a <HI>Right &V;nder&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>I was now, by the King's particular Favour,
&s;ummoned to the Councils of War, my Father
continuing ab&s;ent and ill; and now I began to
think of the real Grounds, and which was more,
of the fatal I&s;&s;ue of this War. I &s;ay, I now be|gan
<PB N="195" REF="201">
it; for I cannot &s;ay that I ever rightly &s;ta|ted
Matters in my own Mind before, though I
had been enough u&s;ed to Blood, and to &s;ee the De|&s;truction
of People, &s;acking of Towns, and plun|dering
the Country; yet 'twas in <HI>Germany,</HI> and
among Strangers; but I found a &s;trange &s;ecret
and unaccountable Sadne&s;s upon my Spirits to &s;ee
this acting in my own native Country. It grie|ved
me to the Heart, even in the Rout of our
Enemies, to &s;ee the Slaughter of them; and even
in the Fight, to hear a Man cry for Quarter in
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> moved me to a Compa&s;&s;ion which I had
never been u&s;ed to; nay, &s;ometimes it looked to
me as if &s;ome of my own Men had been beaten; and
when I heard a Soldier cry, <HI>O God, I am &s;hot,</HI> I
looked behind me to &s;ee which of my own Troop
was fallen. Here I &s;aw my &s;elf at the cutting
of the Throats of my Friends; and indeed &s;ome
of my near Relations. My old Comerades and
Fellow-&s;oldiers in <HI>Germany</HI> were &s;ome <HI>with us,</HI> &s;ome
<HI>again&s;t us,</HI> as their Opinions happened to differ
an Religion. For my part, I confe&s;s I had not
much Religion in me, at that time; but I
thought Religion rightly practi&s;ed on both Sides
would have made us all better Friends; and there|fore
&s;ometimes I began to think, that both the
Bi&s;hops of our Side, and the Preachers on theirs,
made Religion rather <HI>the Pretence</HI> than <HI>the Cau&s;e</HI>
of the War; and from tho&s;e Thoughts I vigorou|&s;ly
argued it at the Council of War again&s;t
marching to <HI>Brentford,</HI> while the Addre&s;s for a
Treaty of Peace from the Parliament was in Hand;
for I was for taking the Parliament by the Handle
which they had given us, and entring into a
Negotiation with the Advantage of its being
<HI>at their own Reque&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202">
I thought the King had now in his Hands an
Opportunity to make an honourable Peace; for
this Battle at <HI>Edgchill,</HI> as much as they boa&s;ted
of the Victory to hearten up their Friends, had
&s;orely weakened their Army, and di&s;couraged
their Party too, which in Effect was wor&s;e as to
their Army. The Hor&s;e were particularly in an
ill Ca&s;e, and the Foot greatly dimini&s;hed; and
the Remainder very &s;ickly: But be&s;ides this, the
Parliament, were greatly alarmed at the Progre&s;s
we made afterward; and &s;till fearing the King's
&s;urprizing them, had &s;ent for the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
to <HI>London,</HI> to defend them; by which the Coun|try
was as it were, de&s;erted and abandoned, and
left to be plundered; our Parties over-run all
Places at Plea&s;ure. All this while I con&s;idered,
that whatever the Soldiers of Fortune meant by
the War, our De&s;ires were to &s;uppre&s;s the ex|orbitant
Power of a Party, to e&s;tabli&s;h our King
in his ju&s;t and legal Rights; but not with a De|&s;ign
to de&s;troy the Con&s;titution of Government,
and the Being of Parliament; and therefore I
thought now was the Time for Peace, and their
were a great many worthy Gentlemen in the
Army of my Mind; and, had our Ma&s;ter had
Ears to hear us, the War might have had an
End here.</P>
<P>This Addre&s;s for Peace was received by the
King at <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> whither this Army was
now advanced, and his Maje&s;ty returned An&s;wer
by Sir Peter Killegrem, that he de&s;ired nothing
more, and would not be wanting on his Part.
Upon this the Parliament name Commi&s;&s;ioners,
and his Maje&s;ty excepting again&s;t Sir <HI>John
Evelyn,</HI> they left him out, and &s;ent others; and
de&s;ired the King to appoint his Re&s;idence near
<HI>London,</HI> where the Commi&s;&s;ioners might wait
<PB N="197" REF="203">
upon him. Accordingly the King appointed
<HI>Wind&s;or</HI> for the Place of Treaty, and de&s;ired the
Treaty might be haftened. And thus all things
looked with a favourable A&s;pect, when one un|lucky
Action knocked it all on the Head, and
filled both Parties with more implacable Ani|mo&s;ities
than they had before, and all Hopes of
Peace vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>During this Progre&s;s of the King's Armies, we
were always abroad with the Hor&s;e ravaging the
Country, aud plundering the Roundheads. Prince
<HI>Ruport,</HI> a mo&s;t active vigilant Party-man, and I
must own, fitter for &s;uch than for a General, was
never lying &s;till, and I &s;eldom &s;tayed behind; for
our Regiment being very well mounted, he
would always &s;end for us, if he had any extraor|dinary
De&s;ign in Hand.</P>
<P>One time in particular he had a De&s;ign upon
<HI>Alisbury,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Buckingham&s;hire;</HI> indeed
our View at fir&s;t was rather to beat the Enemy
out of Town and demoli&s;h their Works, and per|haps
rai&s;e &s;ome Contributions on the rich Coun|try
round it, than to Garri&s;on the Place, and keep
it; for we wanted no more Garri&s;ons, being
Ma&s;ters of the Field.</P>
<P>The Prince had 2500 Hor&s;e with him in
this Expedition, but no Foot; the Town had
&s;me Foot rai&s;ed in the Country by Mr. <HI>Hamb|den,</HI>
and two Regiments of the Country Militia,
whom we made light of, but we found they &s;tood
to their Tackle better than <HI>well enough.</HI> We
came very early to the Town, and thought they
had no Notice of us; but &s;ome fal&s;e Brother had
given them the Alarm and we found them all in
Arms, the Hedges without the Town lined with
Mu&s;queteers, on that Side in particular where
they expected, us, and the two Regiments of Foot
<PB N="198" REF="204">
drawn up in View to &s;upport them, with &s;ome
Hor&s;e in the Rear of all.</P>
<P>The Prince willing however to do &s;ome thing,
cau&s;ed some of his Hor&s;e to alight, and &s;erve as
Dragoons; and having broken a Way into the
Enclo&s;ures, the Hor&s;e beat the Foot from behind
the Hedges, while the re&s;t who were alighted
charged them in the Lane which leads to the
Town. Here they had ca&s;t up &s;ome Works, and
fired from their Lines very regularly, considering
them as Militia only, the Governour encouraging
them by his Example; &s;o that finding without
&s;ome Foot there would be no good to be done, we
gave it over, and drew off; and &s;o <HI>Alisbury</HI> &s;caped a
&s;couring for that Time.</P>
<P>I cannot deny but the&s;e flying Parties of Hor&s;e
committed great Spoil among the Country Peo|ple;
and &s;ometimes the Prince gave a Liberty to
&s;ome Cruelties which were not at all for the
King's Intere&s;t; becau&s;e it being &s;till upon our
own Country, and the King's own Subjects,
whom, in all his Declarations, he prote&s;ted to be
careful of. It &s;eemed to contradict all tho&s;e pro|te&s;tations
and Declarations, and &s;erved to aggra|vate
and exa&s;perate the Common People; and
the King's Enemies made all the Advantages of
it that was po&s;&s;ible, by crying out of twice as
many Extravagancies as were committed.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the King, who naturally abhorred
&s;uch thing, could not re&s;train his Men, no nor
his Generals, &s;o ab&s;olutely as he would have
done. The War, on his Side, was very much
<HI>a la Voluntier;</HI> many Gentlemen &s;erved him at
their own Charge, and &s;ome paid whole Regi|ments
them&s;elves: Sometimes al&s;o the King's
Affairs were &s;traiter than ordinary, and his
Men were not very well paid, and this obliged
<PB N="199" REF="205">
him to wink at their Excur&s;ions upon the Coun|try,
though he did not approve of them; and
yet I mu&s;t own, that in tho&s;e Parts of <HI>England</HI>
were the War was hotte&s;t, there never was &s;een
that Ruin and Depopulation, Murthers, Ravi&s;h|ments,
and Barbarities, which I have &s;een even
among Prote&s;tant Armies abroad in <HI>Germany,</HI> and
other foreign Parts of the World. And if the
Parliament People had &s;een tho&s;e things abroad,
as I had, they would not have complained.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t I have &s;een was plundering the
Towns for Provi&s;ions, drinking up their Beer,
and turning our Hor&s;es into their Fields, or
Stacks of Corn; and sometimes the Soldiers would
be a little rude with the Wenches; but alas
what was this to Count <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Ravages in <HI>Saxony?</HI>
Or what was our taking of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> by Storm,
where they cried out of our Barbarities, to the
&s;acking of <HI>New Brandenburgh,</HI> or the taking of
<HI>Magdeburgh?</HI> In <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> of 7 or 8000 Peple in
the Town, 300 were killed; in <HI>Megdeburgh,</HI> of
25000 &s;carce 2700 were left, and the whole
Town burnt to A&s;hes. I my &s;elf, have seen 17
or 18 Villages on Fire in a Day, and the People
driven away from their Dwellings, like Herds of
Cattle; the Men murthered, the Women &s;tript;
and, 7 or 800 of them together, after they had
&s;uffered all the Indignities and Abu&s;es of the
Soldiers, driven &s;tarknaked in the Winter through
the great Towns, to &s;eek Shelter and Relief
from the Charity of their Enemies. I do not
in&s;tance the&s;e greater Barbarities to ju&s;tify le&s;&s;er
Actions, which are neverthele&s;s irregular; but,
<HI>I do say,</HI> that Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, this War
was managed with as much Humanity on both
Sides as could be expected, e&s;pecially al&s;o con|&s;idering
the Animo&s;ity of Parties.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="206">
But to Return to the Prince, he had not always
the &s;ame Succe&s;s in the&s;e Enterprizes, for &s;ome|times
we came &s;hort home. And I cannot omit one
plea&s;ant Adventure which happened to a Party
of ours in one of the&s;e Excur&s;ions into <HI>Buck|ingham&s;hire.</HI>
The Major of our Regiment was
&s;oundly beaten by a Party which, as I may &s;ay
was led by a Woman; and, if I had not re&s;cued
him, I know not but he had been taken Pri&s;oner
by a Woman. It &s;eems our Men had be&s;ieged
&s;ome fortified Hou&s;e about <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> towards
<HI>Tame,</HI> and the Hou&s;e being defended by the Lady
in her Husband's Ab&s;ence, &s;he had yielded the
Hou&s;e upon a Capitulation; one of the Articles
of which was, to march out with all her Servants,
Soldiers, and Goods, and to be convey'd to <HI>Tame:</HI>
Whether &s;he thought to have gone no farther,
or that &s;he reckoned her &s;elf &s;afe there, I know
not; but my Major, with two Troops of Hor&s;e
meets with this Lady and her Party, about five
Miles from <HI>Tame,</HI> as we were coming back from
our defeated Attack of <HI>Alisbury.</HI> We reckoned
our &s;elves in an Enemy's Country, and had lived
a little at large, or at Di&s;cretion, <HI>as 'tis called
abroad;</HI> and the&s;e two Troops with the Major, were
returning to our Detachment from a little Vil|lage,
where, at a Farmer's Hou&s;e, they had met
with &s;ome Liquor, and truly &s;ome of his Men
were &s;o drunk they could but lu&s;t &s;it upon their
Hor&s;es. The Major him&s;elf was not much bet|ter,
and the whole Body were but in a &s;orry
Condition to fight. Upon the Road they meet this
Party; the Lady having no De&s;ign of Fighting,
and being as &s;he thought under the Protection of
the Articles, &s;ounds a Parley, and de&s;ired to
&s;peak with the Officer. The Major <HI>as drunk as
be was,</HI> could tell her, that by the Articles &s;he
<PB N="201" REF="207">
was to be a&s;&s;ured no farther than <HI>Tame,</HI> and be|ing
now five Miles beyond it, &s;he was a fair
Enemy, and therefore demanded to render them|&s;elves
Pri&s;oners. The Lady &s;eemed &s;urprized,
but being &s;en&s;ible &s;he was in the wrong, offered
to compound for her Goods, and would have
given him 300 1. and, I think, &s;even or eight
Hor&s;es: The Major would certainly have taken
it, if he had not been drunk; but he refu&s;ed it,
and gave threatning Words to her, blu&s;tering in
Language which he thought proper to fright a
Woman, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would cut them all to
Pieces, and give no Quarter, <HI>and the like.</HI> The
Lady, who had been more u&s;ed to the Smell of
Powder than he imagined, called &s;ome of her
Servants to her; and con&s;ulting with them what
to do, they all unanimou&s;ly encouraged her to
let them fight; told her, it was plain that the
Commander was drunk, and all that were with
him were rather wor&s;e than, he, and hardly
able to &s;it their Hor&s;es; and that therefore one
bold Charge would put them all into Confu&s;ion.
<HI>In a Word,</HI> &s;he con&s;ented, and, as &s;he was a Wo|man,
they de&s;ired her to &s;ecure her &s;elf among
the Waggons; but &s;he refu&s;ed, and told them
bravely, &s;he would take her Eate with them.
<HI>In &s;hort,</HI> &s;he boldly bad my Major Defiance, and
that he might do his wor&s;t, &s;ince &s;he had of|fered
him fair, and he had refu&s;ed it; her
Mind was altered now, and &s;he would give him
nothing, and bad his Officer that parlied longer
with her, be gone; &s;o the Parly ended. After
this, &s;he gave him fair Leave to go back to his Men;
but before he could tell his Tale to them, &s;he was
at his Heels, with all her Men, and gave him
&s;uch a home Charge as put his Men into Di&s;|order;
and, being too drunk to rally, they were
<PB N="202" REF="208">
knocked down before they knew what to do
with them&s;elves; and, in a few Minutes more,
they took to a plain Flight. But what was
&s;till wor&s;e, the Men, being &s;ome of them very
drunk, when they came to run for their Lives,
fell over one another, and tumbled over their
Hor&s;es, and made &s;uch Work, that a Troop of
Women might have beaten them all. In this
Pickle, with the Enemy at his Heels, I came
in with him, hearing the Noi&s;e; when I ap|peared,
the Pur&s;uers retreated, and, &s;eeing what
a Condition my People were in, and not know|ing
the Strength of the Enemy, I contented my
&s;elf with bringing them off without pur&s;uing
the other; nor could I ever hear po&s;itively
who this Female Captain was. We lo&s;t 17 or
18 of our Men, and about 30 Hor&s;es; but when
the Particulars of the Story were told us, our
Major was &s;o laughed at by the whole Army,
and laughed at every where, that he was a|&s;hamed
to &s;hew him&s;elf for a Week or a Fort|night
after.</P>
<P>But, to return to the King; his Maje&s;ty, <HI>as
I ob&s;erved,</HI> was at <HI>Maidenhead</HI> addre&s;&s;ed by the
Parliament for Peace, and <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> being appoin|ted
for the Place of Treaty, the Van of his Ar|my
lay at <HI>Colebrook.</HI> In the mean time, whether
it were true, or only a Pretence, but it was re|ported
the Parliament General had &s;ent a Body
of his Troops, with a Train of Artillery, to <HI>Ham|mer&s;mith,</HI>
in order to fall upon &s;ome part of our
Army, or to take &s;ome advanced Po&s;t, which was
to the Prejudice of our Men; whereupon the
King ordered the Army to march, and, by the
Favour of a thick Mi&s;t, came within half a Mile
of <HI>Brentford</HI> before he was di&s;covered. There
were two Regiments of Foot, and about 600
<PB N="203" REF="209">
Hor&s;e in the Town, of the Enemy's be&s;t Troops;
the&s;e taking the Alarm, po&s;ted them&s;elves on
the Bridge at the We&s;t End of the Town. The
King attacked them with a &s;elect Detachment
of his be&s;t Infantry, and they defended them|&s;elves
with incredible Ob&s;tinacy. I mu&s;t own,
I never &s;aw <HI>raw Men,</HI> for they could not have
been in Arms above four Months, act like them
in my Life. <HI>In &s;hort,</HI> there was no forcing the&s;e
Men; for, though two whole Brigades of our
Foot, backed by our Hor&s;e, made five &s;everal
Attacks upon them, they could not break them,
and we lo&s;t a great many brave Men in that
Action. At la&s;t, &s;eeing the Ob&s;tinacy of the&s;e
Men, a Party of Hor&s;e was ordered to go round
from <HI>O&s;terly;</HI> and, entering the Town on the
North Side, where, though the Hor&s;e made
&s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance, it was not con&s;iderable, the
Town was pre&s;ently taken. I led my Regiment
through an Enclo&s;ure, and came into the Town
nearer to the Bridge than the re&s;t, by which
Means I got fir&s;t into the Town; but I had
this Lo&s;s by my Expedition, that the Foot
charged me before the Body was come up, and
pouring in their Shot very furiou&s;ly, my Men
were but in an ill Ca&s;e, and would not have
ftood much longer, if the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e co|ming
up the Lane had not found them other
Employment. When the Hor&s;e were thus en|tered,
they immediately di&s;per&s;ed the Enemy's
Hor&s;e, who fled away towards <HI>London,</HI> and fal|ling
in Sword in Hand upon the Rear of the
Foot, who were engaged at the Bridge, they
were all cut in Pieces, except about 200, who
&s;corning to ask Quarter, de&s;perately threw them|&s;elves
into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> where they were
mo&s;t of them drowned.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="210">
The Parliament, and their Party, made a great
Outcry at this Attempt; that it was ba&s;e and
treacherous while in a Treaty of Peace; and
that the King, having amu&s;ed them with hearken|ing
to a Treaty, de&s;igned to have &s;eized upon
their Train of Artillery fir&s;t, and after that, to
have &s;urprized both the City of <HI>London</HI> and the
Parliament. And I have ob&s;erved &s;ince, that
our Hi&s;torians note this Action as contrary to
the Laws of Honour and Treaties; though as
there was no Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms agreed on, no|thing
is more contrary to the Laws of War
than to &s;ugge&s;t it.</P>
<P>That it was a very unhappy thing to the
King and whole Nation, as it broke off the
Hopes of Peace, and was the Occa&s;ion of bring|ing
the <HI>Scots</HI> Army in upon us, I readily acknow|ledge;
but that there was any thing di&s;honou|rable
in it, I cannot allow: For though the Par|liament
had addre&s;&s;ed to the King for Peace,
and &s;uch Steps were taken in it, as before; yet,
as I have &s;aid, there was no Propo&s;als made on
either Side for a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms; and all the
World mu&s;t allow, that in &s;uch Ca&s;es the War
goes on in the Field, while the Peace goes on
in the Cabinet. And if the War goes on, ad|mit
the King had de&s;igned to &s;urprize the City
or Parliament, or all of them, it had been no
more than the Cu&s;tom of War allows, and what
they would have done by him, if they could.
The Treaty of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> or Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI>
which ended the bloody Wars of <HI>Germany,</HI> was
a Precedent for this. That Treaty was actually
negotiating feven Years, and yet the War went
on with all the Vigour and Rancour imaginable,
even to the la&s;t: Nay, the very Time after the
Conclu&s;ion of it, but before the News could be
<PB N="205" REF="211">
brought to the Army, did he that was afterwards
King of <HI>Sweden, Carolus Gu&s;tavus,</HI> take the City of
<HI>Prague,</HI> by Surprize, and therein an ine&s;timable
Booty. Be&s;ides, all the Wars of <HI>Europe</HI> are full
of Examples of this Kind; and therefore I cannot
&s;ee any Rea&s;on to blame the King for this Action
as to the Fairne&s;s of it. Indeed as to the Policy
of it, I can &s;ay little; but the Ca&s;e was this, the
King had a gallant Army, flu&s;hed with Succe&s;s,
and things hitherto had gone on very pro&s;pe|rou&s;ly,
both with his own Army and el&s;ewhere;
he had above 35000 Men in his own Army,
including his Garri&s;ons left at <HI>Banbury, Shrewsbury,
Worce&s;ter, Oxford, Wallingford, Abbingdon, Reading,</HI>
and Places adjacent. On the other Hand, the
Parliament Army came back to <HI>London</HI> in but a
very<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Note, General <HI>Ludlow,</HI> in his Memoirs, p. 52. &s;ays, their Men returned from <HI>Warwick</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> not like Men who had obtained a Victory, but like Men that had been beaten.</NOTE> &s;orry Condition; for what with their
Lo&s;s <HI>in their Victory, as they called it, at</HI> Edgehill,
their Sickne&s;s, and a ha&s;ty March to <HI>London,</HI> they
were very much dimini&s;hed; though at <HI>London</HI>
they &s;oon recruited them again. And this Pro|&s;perity
of the King's Affairs might encourage
him to &s;trike this Blow, thinking to bring the
Parliament to the better Terms, by the Appre|hen&s;ions
of the &s;uperior Strength of the King's
Forces.</P>
<P>But <HI>however it was,</HI> the Succe&s;s did not equal|ly
an&s;wer the King's Expectation; the vigorous
Defence the Troops po&s;ted at <HI>Brentford</HI> made as
above, gave the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Opportunity, with
extraordinary Application, to draw his Forces
out to <HI>Turnham-Green;</HI> and the exceeding Alacri|ty
<PB N="206" REF="212">
of the Enemy was &s;uch, that their whole
Army appeared with them, making together an
Army of 24000 Men, drawn up in View of our
Forces, by 8 o' Clock the next Morning. The
City Regiments were placed between the regular
Troops, and all together offered us Battle, but
we were not in a Condition to accept it. The
King indeed was sometimes of the Mind to charge
them, and once or twice ordered Parties to ad|vance
to begin to skirmi&s;h; but upon better
Advice, altered his Mind; and indeed it was the
wi&s;eft Coun&s;el to defer the fighting at that Time.
The Parliament Generals were as unfixed in their
Re&s;olutions on the other Side, as the King: Some|times
they &s;ent out Parties, and then called them
back again. One &s;trong Party, of near 3000
Men marched off towards <HI>Action,</HI> with Orders
to amu&s;e us on that Side, but were counter|manded.
Indeed I was of the Opinion, we might
have ventured the Battle; for though the Parlia|ment's
Army were more numerous, yet the City
Trained-Bands, which made up 4000 of their
Foot, were not much e&s;teemed, and the King was
a great deal &s;tronger in Hor&s;e than they; but
the main Rea&s;on that hindred the Engagement,
was want of Ammunition, which the King ha|ving
duly weighed, he cau&s;ed the Carriages and
Cannon to draw off fir&s;t, and then the Foot, the
Hor&s;e continuing to face the Enemy till all was
clear gone, and then we drew off too, and mar|ched
to <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> and the next Day to <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P>Now the King &s;aw his Mi&s;take, in not conti|nuing
his March for <HI>London,</HI> in&s;tead of Facing
about to fight the Enemy at <HI>Edgehill.</HI> And all
the Honour we had gained in &s;o many &s;ucce&s;sful
Enterprizes lay buried in this &s;hameful Retreat
from an Army of Citizens Wives: For, truly
<PB N="207" REF="213">
that Appearance at <HI>Turnham-Green</HI> was gay, but
not great. There was as many Lookers on as
Actors; the Crouds of Ladies, 'Prentices and Mob
was &s;o great, that when the Parties of our Army
advanced, and, as they thought, to Charge, the
Coaches, Hor&s;emen, and Croud, that cluttered
away, to be out of Harm's way, looked little
better than a Rout: And I was per&s;waded a good
home Charge from our Hor&s;e would have &s;ent
their whole Army after them; but &s;o it was,
that this Croud of an Army was to triumph
over us, and they did it; for all the Kingdom was
carefully informed how their dreadful Looks had
frightened us away.</P>
<P>Upon our Retreat, the Parliament re&s;ent this
Attack, which they called treacherous, and vote
no Accommodation; but they con&s;idered of it
afterwards, and &s;ent &s;ix Commi&s;&s;ioners to the
King with Propo&s;itions; but the Change of the
Scene of Action changed the Terms of Peace;
and now they made Terms like Conquerors,
petition him to de&s;ert his Army, and return to
the Parliament, and the like. Had his Maje&s;ty, at
the Head of his Army, with the full Reputation
they had before, and in the Ebb of their Affairs,
re&s;ted at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and commenced a Treaty, they
had certainly made more rea&s;onable Propo&s;als;
but now the Scabbard &s;eemed to be thrown
away on both Sides.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Winter was &s;pent in &s;trength|ening
Parties, and Places al&s;o in fruitle&s;s Treaties
of Peace, Me&s;&s;ages, Remon&s;trances, and Paper
War on both Sides, and no Action remarkable
happened any where that I remember: Yet the
King gained Ground every where, and his For|ces
in the <HI>North</HI> encrea&s;ed under the Earl of
<HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> al&s;o my Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> then only called
<PB N="208" REF="214">
Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI> arrived from <HI>Holland,</HI> bringing
three Ships loaden with Arms and Ammunition,
and Notice, that the Queen was following with
more. <HI>Goring</HI> brought 4000 Barrels of Gunpow|der,
and 20000 &s;mall Arms; all which came
very &s;ea&s;onably, for the King was in great want
of them, e&s;pecally the Powder. Upon this Re|cruit
the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> draws down to <HI>York,</HI>
and being above 16000 &s;trong, made Sir <HI>Thomas
Fairfax</HI> give Ground, and retreat to <HI>Hull.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever lay &s;till, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was always
abroad, and I cho&s;e to go out with his High|ne&s;s
as often as I had Opportunity; for hitherto
he was always &s;ucce&s;sful. About this Time the
Prince, being at <HI>Oxford,</HI> I gave him Intelligence
of a Party of the Enemy who lived a little at
large, too much for good Soldiers, about <HI>Ciren|ce&s;ter:</HI>
The Prince glad of the News, re&s;olved to
attack them, and though it was a wet Sea&s;on,
and the Ways exceeding bad, being in <HI>February,</HI>
yet we marched all Night in the Dark, which
occa&s;ioned the Lo&s;s of &s;ome Hor&s;es and Men too,
in Sloughs and Holes, which the Darkne&s;s of the
Night had &s;uffered them to fall into. We were
a very &s;trong Party, being about 3000 Hor&s;e and
Dragoons, and coming to <HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI> very early
in the Morning, to our great Satisfaction the Ene|my
were perfectly &s;urprized, not having the lea&s;t
Notice of our March, which an&s;wered our End
more Ways than one. However, the Earl of
<HI>Stamford</HI>'s Regiment made &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance; but
the Town having no Works to defend it, &s;aving
a &s;light Breaft-Work at the Entrance of the
Road, with a Turn-pike, our Dragoons alighted,
and forcing their Way over the Bellies of <HI>Stam|ford</HI>'s
Foot, they beat them from their Defence,
and followed them at their Heels into the Town;
<PB N="209" REF="215">
<HI>Stamford</HI>'s Regiment was entirely cut in Pieces,
and &s;everal others, to the Number of about
800 Men, and the Town entered without any
other Re&s;i&s;tance. We took 1200 Pri&s;oners, 3000
Arms, and the County Magazin, which at that
was con&s;iderable; for there was about 120 Bar|rels
of Powder, and all things in Proportion.</P>
<P>I received the fir&s;t Hurt I got in this War,
at this Action; for having followed the Dragoons,
and brought my Regiment within the Barricado
which they had gained, a Mu&s;quet Bullet &s;truck
my Hor&s;e ju&s;t in the Head; and that &s;o effectu|ally,
that he fell down as dead as a Stone, all at
once. The Fall plunged me into a Puddle of
Water, and daubed me; and my Man having
brought me another Hor&s;e, and cleaned me
a little, I was ju&s;t getting up, when another
Bullet &s;trook me on my left Hand, which I had
ju&s;t clapt on the Hor&s;e's Mane, to li&s;t my &s;elf
into the Saddle. The Blow broke one of my
Fingers, and brui&s;ed my Hand very much, and
it proved a very painful Hurt to me. For the
pre&s;ent I did not much concern my &s;elf about
it, but made my Man tye it up clo&s;e in my
Handkerchief, and led up my Men to the Mar|ket
Place, where we had a very &s;mart Bru&s;h
with &s;ome Mu&s;queteers who were po&s;ted in the
Church-yard; but our Dragoons &s;oon beat them
out there, and the whole Town was then our
own. We made no Stay here, but marched back
with all our Booty to <HI>Oxford,</HI> for we knew the
Enemy were very &s;trong at <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and that
way.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame Time, the Earl of <HI>Nor|thampton,</HI>
with a &s;trong Party, &s;et upon <HI>Litchfield,</HI>
and took the Town, but could not take the Clo&s;e;
but they beat a Body of 4000 Men coming to
<PB N="210" REF="216">
the Relief of the Town, under Sir <HI>John Gell</HI> of
<HI>Darby&s;hire</HI> and Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and
killing 600 of them, di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Our &s;econd Compaign now began to open;
the King marched from <HI>Oxford</HI> to relieve <HI>Read|ing,</HI>
which was be&s;ieged by the Parliament For|ces;
but Collonel <HI>Fielding,</HI> Lieutenant Gover|nour,
Sir <HI>Arthur A&s;hton</HI> being wounded, &s;urren|dred
to <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> before the King could come up;
for which he was tried by Martial Law, and
condemned to die; but the King forbore to exe|cute
the Sentence. This was the fir&s;t Town we had
lo&s;t in the War; for &s;till the Succe&s;s of the
King's Affairs was very encouraging. This bad
News however was over-balanced by an Account
brought the King at the &s;ame time, by an Ex|pre&s;s
from <HI>York,</HI> that the Queen had landed in
the <HI>North,</HI> and had brought over a great Magazin
of Arms and Ammunition, be&s;ides &s;ome Men.
Some time after this, her Maje&s;ty marching
Southward to meet the King, joined the Army
near <HI>Edgehill,</HI> where the fir&s;t Battle was fought.
She brought the King 3000 Foot, 1500 Hor&s;e
and Dragoons, &s;ix Pieces of Cannon, 1500 Barrels
of Powder, 12000 &s;mall Arms.</P>
<P>During this Pro&s;perity of the King's Affairs,
his Armies encrea&s;ed mightily in the We&s;tern
Counties al&s;o. Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> indeed comman|ded
for the Parliament in tho&s;e Parts too, and
particularly in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire, Hamp&s;hire, and Berk|&s;hire,</HI>
where he carried on their Cau&s;e but too
fa&s;t; but farther We&s;t, Sir <HI>Nicholas Flamming,</HI> Sir
<HI>Ralph Hapton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Bevil Greenvil,</HI> had exten|ded
the King's Quarters from <HI>Cornwall</HI> through
<HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and into <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> where they took
<HI>Excter, Barn&s;table,</HI> and <HI>Biddiford;</HI> and the fir&s;t
of the&s;e they fortified very well, making it a Place
<PB N="211" REF="217">
of Arms for the We&s;t, and afterwards it was
the Re&s;idence of the Queen.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the Famous Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> and
the King's Forces met, and came to a pitched
Battle, where Sir <HI>William</HI> lo&s;t all his Honour
again. This was at <HI>Roundway-down</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire.
Waller</HI> had engaged our <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army at <HI>Lan&s;|down,</HI>
and in a very ob&s;tinate Fight had the
better of them, and made them retreat to
the <HI>Devizes.</HI> Sir <HI>William Hopton</HI> however ha|ving
a good Body of Foot untouched, &s;ent Ex|pre&s;&s;es
and Me&s;&s;engers one in the Neck of
another to the King for &s;ome Hor&s;e, and the
King being in great Concern for that Army,
who were compo&s;ed of the Flower of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI>
Men, commanded me to march with all po&s;&s;ible
Secre&s;y, as well as Expedition, with 1200 Hor&s;e
and Dragoons from <HI>Oxford,</HI> to join them. We &s;et
out in the Depth of the Night, to avoid; if po&s;|sible,
any Intelligence being given of our Rout,
and &s;oon joined with the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army, when it
was as &s;oon re&s;olved to give Battle to <HI>Waller;</HI> and,
give him his due, he was as forward to fight as
we. As it is ea&s;y to meet when both Sides are
willing to be found, Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> met us up|on
<HI>Roundway-down,</HI> where we had a fair Field
on both Sides, and Room enough to draw up
our Hor&s;e. In a Word, there was little Cere|mony
to the Work; the Armies joined, and we
charged his Hor&s;e with &s;o much Re&s;olution, that
they quickly fled, and quitted the Field; for
we over-matched him in Hor&s;e, and this was
the entire De&s;truction of their Army: For their
Infantry, which out-numbered ours by 1500,
were now at our Mercy; &s;ome faint Re&s;i&s;tance
they made, ju&s;t enough to give us Occa&s;ion to
break into their Ranks with our Hor&s;e, where
<PB N="212" REF="218">
we gave Time to our Foot to defeat others that
&s;tood to their Work: Upon which they began
to disband, and run every Way they could;
but our Hor&s;e having &s;urrounded them, we
made a fearful Havock of them.</P>
<P>We lo&s;t not above 200 Men in this Action;
<HI>Waller</HI> lo&s;t abovie 4000 killed and taken, and as
many di&s;per&s;ed that never returned to their
Colours: Tho&s;e of Foot that e&s;caped got into
<HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and <HI>Waller,</HI> with the poor Remains of his
routed Regiments, got to <HI>London;</HI> &s;o that it is
plain &s;ome run Ea&s;t, and &s;ome run We&s;t, that
is to &s;ay, they fled every Way they could.</P>
<P>My going with this Detachment prevented
my being at the Siege of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> attacked much about the &s;ame Time, and
it &s;urrendered in three Days. The Parliament
que&s;tioned Collonel <HI>Nathaniel Fienns,</HI> the Governor,
and had him tried as a Coward by a Court Martial,
and condemned to die, but &s;u&s;pended the Execu|tion
al&s;o, as the King did the Governor of <HI>Reading.</HI>
I have often heard Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;ay, they did Collo|nel
<HI>Fienns</HI> wrong in that Affair; and that if the Col|lonel
would have &s;ummoned him, he would have
demanded a Pa&s;&s;port of the Parliament, and have
come up and convinced the Court, that Collonel
<HI>Fienns</HI> had not misbehaved him&s;elf; and that he had
not a &s;ufficient Garri&s;on to defend a City of that
Extent; having not above 1200 Men in the Town,
excepting &s;ome of <HI>Waller</HI>'s Runaways, mo&s;t of whom
were unfit for Service, and without Arms; and that
the Citizens in general being di&s;affected to him,
and ready on the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion to open the Gates
to the King's Forces, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him
to have kept the City; and <HI>when I had farther in|formed
them,</HI> &s;aid the Prince, <HI>of the Mea&s;ures I had
taken for a general A&s;&s;ault the next Day, I am confi|dent
<PB N="213" REF="219">
I &s;hould have convinc'd them, that I had taken
the City by Storm, if he had not &s;urrendered.</HI></P>
<P>The King's Affairs were now in a very good
Po&s;ture, and three Armies in the North, We&s;t,
and in the Center, counted in the Mu&s;ters above
70000 Men, be&s;ides &s;mall Garri&s;ons and Parties
abroad. Several of the Lords, and more of the
Commons, began to fall off from the Parliament,
and make their Peace with the King; and the
Affairs of the Parliament began to look very
ill. The City of <HI>London</HI> was their inexhau&s;tible
Support and Magazine, both for Men, Money,
and all things nece&s;&s;ary; and whenever their
Army was out of Order, the Clergy of their
Party in but one <HI>Sunday</HI> or two, would preach
the young Citizens out of their Shops, the La|bourers
from their Ma&s;ters, into the Army, and
recruit them on a &s;udden: And all this was &s;till
owing to the Omi&s;&s;ion I fir&s;t ob&s;erved, of not
marching to <HI>London,</HI> when it might have been &s;o
ea&s;ily effected.</P>
<P>We had now another, or a faire Oppottunity,
than before, but, as ill U&s;e was made of it. The
King, as I have ob&s;erved, was in a very good
Po&s;ture; he had three large Armies roving at
large over the Kingdom. The <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army,
Victorious and Numerous, had beaten <HI>Waller,</HI>
&s;ecured and fortified <HI>Exeter,</HI> which the Queen
had made her Re&s;idence, and was there deli|vered
of a Daughter, the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta Ma|ria,</HI>
afterwards Dutche&s;s of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and Mother
of the Dutche&s;s Dowager of <HI>Savoy,</HI> commonly
known in the <HI>French</HI> Stile by the Title of <HI>Madam
Royal. They had</HI> &s;ecured <HI>Salisbury, Sherbon</HI> Ca&s;tle,
<HI>Weymouth, Winche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e,</HI> and com|manded
the whole Country, except <HI>Bridgewater</HI> and
<HI>Taunton, Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Linn;</HI> all which Places they
<PB N="214" REF="220">
held blocked up. The King was al&s;o entirely
Ma&s;ter of all <HI>Wales, Monmouth&s;hire, Che&s;hire, Shrop|&s;hire,
Stafford&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Oxford&s;hire, Berk|&s;hire,</HI>
and all the Towns from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> up the
<HI>Thames to Cirence&s;ter,</HI> except <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Henly;</HI>
and of the Whole <HI>Severn,</HI> except <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> had Garri&s;ons in every
&s;trong Place in the <HI>North,</HI> from <HI>Berwick</HI> upon
<HI>Tweed,</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Newark</HI> upon
<HI>Trent, Hull</HI> only excepted, whither the Lord <HI>Fair|fax</HI>
and his Son Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> were retreated, their
Troops being routed and broken, Sir <HI>Thomas Fair|fax</HI>
his Baggage with his Lady and Servants
taken Pri&s;oners, and him&s;elf hardly e&s;caping.</P>
<P>And now a great Council of War was held in
the King's Quarters, what Enterprize to go up|on;
and it happened to be the very &s;ame Day
when the Parliament were in a &s;erious Debate
what &s;hould become of them, and who&s;e Help
they &s;hould &s;eek? And indeed they had Cau&s;e
for it; and had our Coun&s;els been as ready and
well grounded as theirs, we had put an End to
the War in a Month's time.</P>
<P>In this Council the King propo&s;ed the March|ing
to <HI>London,</HI> to put an End to the Parliament,
and encourage his Friends and loyal Subjects in
<HI>Kent,</HI> who were ready to ri&s;e for him; and
&s;hewed us Letters from the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI>
wherein he offered to join his Maje&s;ty with a
Detachment of 4000 Hor&s;e, and 8000 Foot, if
his Maje&s;ty thought fit to march Southward,
and yet leave Forces &s;ufficient to guard the
<HI>North</HI> from any Inva&s;ion. I confe&s;s, when I &s;aw
the Scheme the King had him&s;elf drawn for this
Attempt, I felt an unu&s;ual Satisfaction in my
Mind, from the Hopes that we might bring this
War to &s;ome tolerable End; for I pro&s;e&s;&s;ed my &s;elf
<PB N="215" REF="221">
on all Occa&s;ions heartily weary of Fighting with
Friends, Brothers, Neighbours, and Acquain|tance:
And I made no Que&s;tion, but this Motion
of the King's would effectually bring the Par|liament
to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>All Men &s;eemed to like the Enterprize but
the Earl of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> who on particular Views
for &s;ecuring the Country behind, as he called it,
propo&s;ed the taking in the Town of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> and
<HI>Hereford</HI> fir&s;t: He made a long Speech of the
Danger of leaving <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> an active, bold Fellow,
with a &s;trong Party in the Heart of all the King's
Quarters, ready on all Occa&s;ions to &s;ally out,
and &s;urprize the neighbouring Garri&s;ons, as he
had done <HI>Sudley</HI> Ca&s;tle and others; and of the
Ea&s;e and Freedom to all tho&s;e We&s;tern Parts, to
have them fully cleared of the Enemy. Intere&s;t
pre&s;ently backs this Advice, and all tho&s;e
Gentlemen who&s;e E&s;tates lay that way, or who&s;e
Friends lived about <HI>Worce&s;ter, Shrewsbury, Bridg|north,</HI>
or the Borders; and who, as they &s;aid, had
heard the frequent Wi&s;hes of the Country to
have the City of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> reduced, fell in with
this Advice, alledging the Con&s;equence it was of
for the Commerce of the Country, to have the
Navigation of the <HI>Severn</HI> free, which was only
interupted by this one Town from the Sea up to
<HI>Shrewsbury</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I oppo&s;ed this, and &s;o did &s;everal others: Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> was vehemently again&s;t it; and we both
offered, with the Troops of the County, to keep
<HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> blocked up during the King's March
for <HI>London,</HI> &s;o that <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> &s;hould not be able
to &s;tir.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;al made the Earl of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>'s
Party more eager for the Siege than before; for
they had no Mind to a Blockade, which would
<PB N="216" REF="222">
leave the Country to maintain the Troops all
the Summer; and of all Men the Prince did not
plea&s;e them: For he having no extraordinary
Character for Di&s;cipline, his Company was not
much de&s;ired even by our Friends. Thus, <HI>in an
ill Hour</HI> 'twas re&s;olved to &s;it down before <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter.</HI>
The King had a gallant Army of 28000
Men, where of 11000 Hor&s;e, the fine&s;t Body of
Gentlemen that ever I &s;aw together in my Life;
their Hor&s;es without Compari&s;on, and their
Equipages the fine&s;t and the be&s;t in the World,
and their Per&s;ons <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> which I think is
enough to &s;ay of them.</P>
<P>According to the Re&s;olution taken in the
Council of War, the Army marched We&s;tward,
and &s;at down before <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> the Beginning of
<HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> There we &s;pent a Month to the lea&s;t
Purpo&s;e that ever Army did; our Men received
frequent Affronts from the de&s;perate Sallies of
an incon&s;iderable Enemy. I cannot forbear re|flecting
on the the Misfortunes of this Siege:
Our Men were &s;trangely di&s;pirited in all the
A&s;&s;aults they gave upon the Place; there was
&s;omething looked like Di&s;a&s;ter and Mi&s;manage|ment,
and our Men went on with an ill Will, and
no Re&s;olution. The King de&s;pi&s;ed the Place,
and the King, to carry it Sword in Hand, made
no regular Approaches, and the Garri&s;on be|ing
de&s;perate, made therefore the greater Slaugh|ter.
In this Work our Hor&s;e, who were &s;o nu|merous
and &s;o fine, had no Employment: 2000
Hor&s;e had been enough for this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
the Enemy had no Garri&s;on or Party within
fourty Miles of us; &s;o that we had nothing to
do but look on with infinite Regret, upon the
Lo&s;&s;es of our Foot.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223">
The Enemy made frequent and de&s;perate
Sallies, in one of which I had my Share. I was
po&s;ted upon a Parade, or Place of Arms, with
Part of my Regiment, and Part of Collonel <HI>Go|ring</HI>'s
Regiment of Hor&s;e, in order to &s;upport a
Body of Foot who were ordered to &s;torm the
Point of a Brea&s;t-work which the Enemy had
rai&s;ed to defend one of the Avenues to the
Town. The Foot were beat off with Lo&s;s, as
they always were; and <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> the Governor,
not content to have beaten them from his Works,
&s;allies out with near 400 Men, and falling in
upon the Foot as they were rallying under the
Cover of our Hor&s;e, we put our &s;elves in the be&s;t
Po&s;ture we could to receive them. As <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> did
not expect, I &s;uppo&s;e, to engage with any Hor&s;e,
he had no Pikes with him, which encouraged us
to treat him the more rudley; but as to de&s;perate
Men Danger is no Danger, when he found he
mu&s;t clear his Hands of us, before he could di&s;|patch
the Foot, he faces up to us, fires but one
Volley of his &s;mall Shot, and fell to battering us
with the Stocks of their Mu&s;quets, in &s;uch a
manner, that one would have thought they had
been mad Men.</P>
<P>We at fir&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed this way of Clubbing us,
and charging through them, laid a great many
of them upon the Ground; and in repeating our
Charge, trampled more of them under our
Hor&s;es Feet: And wheeling thus continually,
beat them off from our Foot, who were ju&s;t up|on
the Point of disbanding. Upon this they
charged us again with their Fire, and at one
Volley killed 33 or 34 Men and Hor&s;es; and
had they had Pikes with them, I know not what
we &s;hould have done with them: But at la&s;t
charging through them again, we divided them;
<PB N="218" REF="224">
one Part of them being hemmed in between us
and our own Foot, were cut in Pieces to a Man;
the re&s;t, as I under&s;tood afterwards, retreated
into the Town, having lo&s;t 300 of their Men.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t Charge I received a rude Blow
from a &s;tout Fellow on Foot, with the But End
of his Mu&s;quet, which perfectly &s;tunned me,
and fetched me off from my Hor&s;e; and had
not &s;ome near me took Care of me, I had been
trod to Death by our own Men: But the Fellow
being immediately killed, and my Friends fin|ding
me alive, had taken me up, and carried me
off at &s;ome Di&s;tance, where I came to my &s;elf
again, after &s;ome time, but knew little of what
I did or &s;aid that Night. This was the Rea&s;on
why I &s;ay I afterwards under&s;tood the Enemy
retreated; for I &s;aw no more what they did
then; nor indeed was I well of this Blow for
all the re&s;t of the Summer, but had frequent
Pains in my Head, Dizzine&s;&s;es and Swimming,
that gave me &s;ome Fears the Blow had injured
the Scull, but it wore off again; nor did it at all
hinder my attending my Charge.</P>
<P>This Action, I think, was the only one that
looked like a Defeat given the Enemy at this
Siege; we kille them near 300 Men, as I have
&s;aid, and lo&s;t about 60 of our Troopers.</P>
<P>All this Time, while the King was harra&s;&s;ing
and weakening the be&s;t Army he ever &s;aw toge|ther
during the whole War, the Parliament Ge|nerals,
or rather Preachers, were recruiting theirs;
for the Preachers were better than Drummers
to rai&s;e Voluntiers, zealou&s;ly exhorting the <HI>Lon|don</HI>
Dames to part with their Husbands, and the
City to &s;end &s;ome of their Trained Bands to join
the Army for the Relief of <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> and now
they began to advance towards us.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="225">
The King hearing of the Advance of <HI>Effex</HI>'s Army,
who by this time was come to <HI>Alisbury,</HI> had &s;um|moned
what Forces he had within Call, to join him;
and accordingly he received 3000 Foot from <HI>Somer|&s;et&s;hire:</HI>
And having batter'd the Town for 36 Hours,
and made a fair Breach, re&s;olves upon an A&s;&s;ault,
if po&s;&s;ible, to carry the Town before the Enemy
came up. The A&s;&s;ault was begun about Seven in the
Evening, and the Men boldly mounted the Breach;
but after a very ob&s;tinate and bloody Di&s;pute, were
beaten out again by the be&s;ieged, with great Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Being thus often repul&s;ed, and the Earl of
<HI>Effex</HI>'s Army approaching, the King calls a Coun|cil
of War, and propo&s;ed to fight <HI>Effex</HI>'s Army.
The Officers of the Hor&s;e were for fighting; and
without doubt we were &s;uperior to him both in
Number and Goodn&s;s of our Hor&s;e, but the Foot
were not in an equal Condition: And the
Collonels of Foot repre&s;enting to the King the
Weakne&s;s of their Regiments, and how their
Men had been bauked and di&s;heartened at this
cur&s;ed Siege, the graver Coun&s;el prevailed, and
it was re&s;olved to rai&s;e the Siege, and retreat
towards <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> till the Army was recruited.
Pur&s;uant to this Re&s;olution, the 5th of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI>
the King having before &s;ent away his heavy
Cannon and Baggage, rai&s;ed the Siege, and
marched to <HI>Berkley</HI> Ca&s;tle. The Earl of <HI>Effex</HI>
came the next Day to <HI>Birdlip Hills;</HI> and under|&s;tanding
by Me&s;&s;engers from Collonel <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> that
the Siege was rai&s;ed, &s;ends a Recrult of 2500
Men into the City, and followed us him&s;elf with
a great Body of Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>This Body of Hor&s;e &s;hewed them&s;elves to us
once in a large Field fit to have entertained
them in; and our Scouts having a&s;&s;ured us they
were not above 4000, and had no Foot with
<PB N="220" REF="226">
them, the King ordered a Detachment of about
the &s;ame Number to face them. I de&s;ired his
Maje&s;ty to let us have two Regiments of Dra|goons
with us, which was then 800 Men in a
Regiment, le&s;t there might be &s;ome Dragoons
among the Enemy, which the King granted;
and accordingly we marched, and drew up in
View of them. They &s;tood their Ground, ha|ving,
as they &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ome Advantage of the
manner they were po&s;ted in, and expected we
would charge them. The King who did us the
Honour to command this Party, finding they
would not &s;tir, calls me to him, and ordered
me with the Dragoons, and my own Regiment,
to take a Circuit round by a Village to a certain
Lane, where in their Retreat they mu&s;t have
pa&s;&s;ed, and which opened to a &s;mall Common
on their Flank, with Orders, if they engaged,
to advance and charge them in the Flank.
I marched immediately; but though the Coun|try
about there was almo&s;t all Enclo&s;ures, yet
their Scouts were &s;o vigilant, that they di&s;|covered
me, and gave Notice to the Body; upon
which their whole Party moved to the Left, as
if they intended to charge me, before the King
with his Body of Hor&s;e could come; but the
King was too vigilant to be circumvented &s;o; and
therefore his Maje&s;ty perceiving this, &s;ends away
three Regiments of Hor&s;e to &s;econd me, and a
Me&s;&s;enger before them, to order me to halt, and
expect the Enemy, for that he would follow with
the whole Body.</P>
<P>But before this Order reached me, I had hal|ted
for &s;ome time; for, finding my &s;elf di&s;co|vered,
and not judging it &s;afe to be entirely cut
off from the main Body, I &s;topt at the Village,
and cau&s;ing my Dragoons to alight, and line a
<PB N="221" REF="227">
thick Hedge on my Left. I drew up my Hor&s;e
ju&s;t at the Entrance into the Village opening to
a Common; the Enemy came up on the Trot
to charge me, but were &s;aluted with a terrible
Fire from the Dragoons out of the Hedge,
which killed them near 100 Men. This being
a perfect Surprize to them, they halted; and
ju&s;t at that Moment they received Orders from
their main Body to retreat; the King at the
&s;ame time appearing upon $ome &s;mall Heights
in their Rear, which obliged them to think of
retreating, or coming to a general Battle, which
was none of their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>I had no Occa&s;ion to follow them, not being
in a Condition to attack their whole Body;
but the Dragoons coming out into the Common,
gave them another Volley at a Di&s;tance, which
reached them effectually; for it killed about 20
of them, and wounded more; but they drew
off, and never fired a Shot at us, fearing to be
enclo&s;ed between two Parties, and &s;o marched
away to their General's Quarters, leaving 10 or
12 more of their Fellows killed, and about 180
Hor&s;es. Our Men, after the Country Fa&s;hion,
gave them a Shout at parting, to let them &s;ee
we knew they were afraid of us.</P>
<P>However, this Relieving of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> rai&s;ed the
Spirits as well as the Reputation of the Parlia|ment
Forces, and was a great Defeat to us; and
from this time things began to look with a me|lancholy
A&s;pect; for the pro&s;perous Condition
of the King's Affairs began to decline. The Op|portunities
he had let &s;lip, were never to be re|covered;
and the Parliament, in their former
Extremity, having voted an Invitation to the <HI>Scots</HI>
to March to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we had now new Ene|mies
to encounter; and indeed there began the
<PB N="222" REF="228">
Ruine of his Maje&s;ty's Affairs; for the Earl of
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> not able to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the
<HI>Scots</HI> on his Rear, the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> in his
Front, and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> on his Flank, was
every where routed and defeated, and his Forces
obliged to quit the Field to the Enemy.</P>
<P>About this Time it was that we fir&s;t began to
hear of one <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> who, like a little
Cloud, ro&s;e out of the Ea&s;t, and &s;pread fir&s;t into
the North, 'till it &s;hed down a Flood that over|helmed
the three Kindoms.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t was a private Captain of Hor&s;e, but
now commanded a Regiment whom he armed
<HI>Cap-a-pee a la Curia&s;&s;ier;</HI> and joining with the Earl
of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> the fir&s;t Action we heard of him,
that made him any thing famous, was about
<HI>Grantham,</HI> where, with only his own Regiment,
he defeated 24 Troops of Hor&s;e and Dragoons
of the King's Forces: Then at <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> with
two Regiments, his own of Hor&s;e, and one of
Dragoons, where he defeated near 3000 of the
Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Men, killed Lieutenant Gene|ral
<HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI>
who commanded them, and relieved <HI>Gain&s;|borough;</HI>
and though the whole Army came in
to the Re&s;cue, he made good his Retreat to
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> with little Lo&s;s; and the next Week he
defeated Sir <HI>John Hender&s;on,</HI> at <HI>Winsby,</HI> near <HI>Horn
Ca&s;tle,</HI> with &s;ixteen Regiments of Hor&s;e and
Dragoons, him&s;elf having not half that Num|ber,
killed the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> Sir <HI>Ingram Hopton,</HI>
and &s;everal Gentlemen of Quality.</P>
<P>Thus this Firebrand of War began to blaze,
and he &s;oon grew a Terror to the North; for
Victory attended him like a Page of Honour,
and he was &s;carce ever known to be beaten, du|ring
the whole War.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="229">
Now we began to reflect again on the Mi&s;|fortune
of our Ma&s;ter's Coun&s;els: Had we
marched to <HI>London,</HI> in&s;tead of be&s;ieging <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI>
we had fini&s;hed the War with a Stroke. The
Parliament's Army was in a mo&s;t de&s;picable
Condition, and had never been recruited, had we
not given them a Month's time, which we linge|red
away at this fatal Town of <HI>Glouce&s;ter:</HI> But
'twas too late to reflect; we were a di&s;heartned
Army, but we were not beaten yet, nor broken;
we had a large Country to recruit in, and we lo&s;t
no time, but rai&s;ed Men apace. In the mean
time his Maje&s;ty, after a &s;hort Stay at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
makes back again towards <HI>Oxford</HI> with a part
of the Foot, and all the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cirenee&s;ter</HI> we had a Bru&s;h again with
<HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> that Town owed us a &s;hrewd Turn for
having handled them coar&s;ly enough before,
when Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;eized the County Maga|zine.
I happened to be in the Town that Night
with Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;p,</HI> who&s;e Regiment of Hor&s;e
quartered there with Collonel <HI>Spencer,</HI> and &s;ome
Foot; my own Regiment was gone before to
<HI>Oxford.</HI> About Ten at Night, a Party of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s
Men beat up our Quarters by Surprize, ju&s;t as
we had &s;erved them before; they fell in with
us, ju&s;t as People were going to Bed, and having
beaten the Out-Guards, where gotten into the
Middle of the Town, before our Men could get
on Hor&s;eback. Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;p</HI> hearing the
Alarm, gets up, and with &s;ome or his Clothes on,
and &s;ome off, comes into my Chamber: We are
all undone, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Roundheads are upon us,
We had but little time to confult; but being in
one of the principal Inns in the Town, we pre&s;ent|ly
ordered the Gates of the Inn to be &s;hut, and
&s;ent to all the Inns where our Men were quartered,
<PB N="224" REF="230">
to do the like, with Orders, if they had any
Back-doors, or Ways to get out, to come to us.
By this means however we got &s;o much time as
to get on Hor&s;eback, and &s;o many of our Men
came to us by Back-ways, that we had near 300
Hor&s;e in the Yards and Places behind the Hou&s;e;
and now we began to think of Breaking out
by a Lane which led from the back Side of the
Inn; but a new Accident determined us another,
<HI>though a wor&s;e</HI> Way. The Enemy being entered,
and our Men cooped up in the Yards of the Inns,
Collonel <HI>Spencer</HI> the other Collonel, who&s;e Regi|ment
of Hor&s;e lay al&s;o in the Town, had got on
Hor&s;eback before us, and engaged with the Ene|my,
but being over-powered, retreated fighting,
and &s;ends to Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;p</HI> for Help. Sir
<HI>Nicholas</HI> moved to &s;ee the Di&s;tre&s;s of his Friend,
turning to me, &s;ays he <HI>What can we do for him?</HI>
I told him, I thought 'twas time to help him, if
po&s;&s;ible; upon which, opening the Inn Gates,
we &s;allied out in very good Order, about 300
Hor&s;e; and &s;everal of the Troops from other
parts of the Town joining us, we recovered
Collonel <HI>Spencer,</HI> and charging home, beat back
the Enemy to their main Body: But finding
their Foot drawn up in the Church-yard,
and &s;everal Detachments moving to charge us,
we retreated in as good Order as we could. They
did not think fit to pur&s;ue us, but they took
all the Carriages which were under the Convoy
of this Party, and loaden with Provi&s;ions and
Ammunition, and above 500 of our Hor&s;e. The
Foot &s;hifted away as well as they could: Thus we
made off in a &s;hattered Condition towards <HI>Far|rington,</HI>
and &s;o to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and I was very glad
my Regiment was not there.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="231">
We had &s;mall Re&s;t at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or indeed any
where el&s;e; for the King was marched from
thence, and we followed him. I was &s;omething
unea&s;y at my Ab&s;ence from my Regiment, and
did not know how the King might re&s;ent it,
which cau&s;ed me to ride after them with all Ex|pedition.
But the Armies were engaged that
very Day at <HI>Newberry,</HI> and I came in too late.
I had not behaved my &s;elf &s;o as to be &s;u&s;pected
of a wilful Shunning the Action; but a Collonel
of a Regiment ought to avoid Ab&s;ence from his
Regiment in time of Fight, be the Excu&s;e never
&s;o ju&s;t, as carefully as he would a Surprize in
his Quarters. The <HI>Truth is,</HI> 'twas an Error of
my own, and owing to two Days Stay I made at
the <HI>Bath,</HI> where I met with &s;ome Ladies who
were my Relations: And this is far from being
an Excu&s;e; for if the King had been a <HI>Gu&s;ta|vus
Adolphus,</HI> I had certainly received a Check
for it.</P>
<P>This Fight was very ob&s;tinate, and could our
Hor&s;e have come to Action as freely as the Foot,
the Parliament Army had &s;uffered much more;
for we had here a much better Body of Hor&s;e
than they, and we never failed beating them
where the Weight of the Work lay upon the
Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Here the City Train-Bands, of which there
was two Regiments, and whom we u&s;ed to de|&s;pi&s;e,
fought very well: They lo&s;t one of their
Collonels, and &s;everal Officers in the Action;
and I heard our Men &s;ay, they behaved them|&s;elves
as well as any Forces the Parliament
had.</P>
<P>The Parliament cried Victory here too, <HI>as they
always did;</HI> and indeed where the Foot were
concerned they had &s;ome Advantage; but our
<PB N="226" REF="232">
Hor&s;e defeated them evidently. The King drew
up his Army in Battalia, in Per&s;on, and faced
them all the next Day, inviting them to renew
the Fight; but they had no Stomach to come
on again.</P>
<P>It was a kind of a Hedge Fight, for neither
Army was drawn out in the Field; if it had,
'twould never have held from fix in the Morning
to ten at Night: But they fought for Advan|tages;
&s;ometimes one Side had the better, &s;ome|times
another. They fought twice through the
Town, in at one End, and out at the other; and in
the Hedges and Lanes, with exceeding Fury. The
King lo&s;t the mo&s;t Men, his Foot having &s;uffe|red
for want of the Succour of their Hor&s;e, who
on two &s;everal Occa&s;ions, could not come at
them. But the Parliament Foot &s;uffered al&s;o,
and two Regiments were entirely cut in Peices,
and the King kept the Field.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Parliament General, had the Pillage
of the dead, and le&s;t us to bury them; for while
we &s;tood all Day to our Arms, having given them
a fair Field to fight us in, their Camp Rabble
&s;tript the dead Bodies, and they not daring to
venture a &s;econd Engagement with us, marched
away towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The King Lo&s;s in this Action the Earls of
<HI>Carnarvon</HI> and <HI>Sunderland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> a
<HI>French</HI> Marque&s;s, and &s;ome very gallant Officers,
and about 1200 Men. The Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI> was
brought into an Inn in <HI>Newberry,</HI> where the
King came to &s;ee him. He had ju&s;t Life enough
to &s;peak to his Maje&s;ty, and died in his Pre&s;ence.
The King was exceedingly concerned for him,
and was ob&s;erved to &s;hed Tears at the Sight of
it. We were indeed all of us troubled for the
Lo&s;s of &s;o brave a Gentleman, but the Concern
<PB N="227" REF="233">
our royal Ma&s;ter di&s;covered, moved us more
than ordinary. Every body endeavoured to have
the King out of the Room, but he would not &s;tir
from the Bed Side, till he &s;ee all Hopes of Life
was gone.</P>
<P>The indefatigable Indu&s;try of the King, his
Servants and Friends, continually to &s;upply and
recruit his Forces, and to harra&s;s and fatigue
the Enemy, was &s;uch, that we &s;hould &s;till have
given a good Account of the War had the <HI>Scots</HI>
&s;tood neuter. But bad News came every Day
out of the North; as for other Places, Parties
were always in Action: Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> and
Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> beat one another by Turns;
and Sir <HI>Ralph</HI> had extended the King's Quarters
from <HI>Launce&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Cornwal</HI> to <HI>Farnham</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI>
where he gave Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> a Rub, and
drove him into the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>But in the North, the Storm grew thick, the
<HI>Scots</HI> advanced to the Borders, and entered <HI>Eng|land</HI>
in Confederacy with the Parliament, again&s;t
their King; for which the Parliament requited
them afterwards as they de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Had it not been for this <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, the Par|liament
had ea&s;ily been reduced to Terms of
Peace: But after this they never made any Pro|po&s;als
fit for the King to receive. Want of
Succe&s;s before had made them differ among
them&s;elves: <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Waller</HI> could never agree;
the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> and the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
differed to the highe&s;t Degree; and the King's
Affairs went never the wor&s;e for it. But this
Storm in the North ruined us all; for the <HI>Scots</HI>
prevailed in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and being joined with
<HI>Fair&s;ax, Manche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> carried all be|fore
them; &s;o that the King was obliged to &s;end
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with a Body of 4000 Hor&s;e, to
<PB N="228" REF="234">
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> where
that Prince fini&s;hed the De&s;truction of the King's
Intere&s;t, by the ra&s;he&s;t and unaccountable&s;t Action
in the World, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in its Place.</P>
<P>Another Action of the King's though in it
&s;elf no greater a Cau&s;e of Offence than the cal|ling
the <HI>Scots</HI> into the Nation, gave great Offence
in general, and even the King's own Friends
di&s;liked it; and was carefully improved by his
Enemies to the Di&s;advantage of the King, and
of his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Rebels in <HI>Ireland</HI> had, ever &s;ince the
bloody Ma&s;&s;acre of the Prote&s;tants, maintained
a War again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Or|mond</HI>
was General and Governour for the King.
The King finding his Affairs pinch him at home,
&s;ends Orders to the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> to con&s;ent
to a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms with the Rebels, and to
&s;hip over certain of his Regiments hither to his
Maje&s;ty's A&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>'Tis true,</HI> the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had de|&s;erved
to be very ill treated by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but
while the Parliament pre&s;&s;ed the King with a
cruel and unnatural War at home, and called
in an Army out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to &s;upport their
Quarrel with their King, I could never be con|vinced,
that it was &s;uch a di&s;honourable Action
for the King to &s;u&s;pend the Correction of his
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebls, 'till he was in a Capacity to do it
with Safety to him&s;elf, or to delay any farther
A&s;&s;i&s;tance to pre&s;erve him&s;elf at home; and the
Troops he recalled being his own, it was no
Breach of his Honour to make u&s;e of them, &s;ince
he now wanted them for his own Security,
again&s;t tho&s;e who fought again&s;t him at home.</P>
<P>But the King was per&s;waded to make one
Step farther; and that, I confe&s;s, was unplea&s;ing
to us all; and &s;ome of his be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful
<PB N="229" REF="235">
Servants took the Freedom to &s;peak plainly to
him of it; and that was bringing &s;ome Regi|ments
of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> them&s;elves over. This ca&s;t,
as we thought an <HI>Odium</HI> upon our whole Nation,
being &s;ome of tho&s;e very Wretches who had
dipt their Hands in the innocent Blood of
the Prote&s;tants, and with unheard of Butcheries,
had ma&s;&s;acred &s;o many Thou&s;ands of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in
cool Blood.</P>
<P>Abundance of Gentlemen for&s;ook the King
upon this Score; and &s;eeing they could not brook
the Fighting in Conjunction with this wicked
Generation, came into the Declaration of the
Parliament, and making Compo&s;ition for their
E&s;tates, lived retired Lives all the re&s;t of the
War, or went abroad.</P>
<P>But as Exigences and Nece&s;&s;ities oblige us to
do things which at other times we would not
do, and is, as to Man, &s;ome Excu&s;e for &s;uch
things; &s;o I cannot but think the Guilt and
Di&s;honour of &s;uch an Action mu&s;t lye, very much
of it, at lea&s;t, at their Doors, who drove the
King to the&s;e Nece&s;&s;ities and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es by cal|ling
in an Army of his own Subjects whom he
had not injured, but had complied with them in
every thing, to make War upon him without
any Provocation.</P>
<P>As to the Quarrel between the King and his
Parliament, there may &s;omething be &s;aid on
both Sides; and the King &s;aw Cau&s;e him&s;elf, to
di&s;own and di&s;like &s;ome things he had done, which
the Parliament objected again&s;t, &s;uch as levying
Money without Con&s;ent of Parliament, Infracti|ons
on their Privileges, <HI>and the like:</HI> Here I &s;ay,
was &s;ome room for an Argument at lea&s;t, and
Conce&s;&s;ions on both Sides were needful to
come to a Peace; but for the <HI>Scots,</HI> all their
<PB N="230" REF="236">
Demands had been an&s;wered, all their Grievan|ces
had been redre&s;&s;ed, they had made Ar|ticles
with their Sovereign, and he had performed
tho&s;e Articles; their capital Enemy Epi&s;copacy
was aboli&s;hed; they had not one thing to de|mand
of the King which he had not granted:
And therefore they had no more Cau&s;e to take
up Arms again&s;t their Sovereign, than they had
again&s;t the <HI>Grand Senior.</HI> But it mu&s;t for ever
lye again&s;t them as a Brand of Infamy, and as a
Reproach on their Whole Nation that, <HI>purcha&s;ed
by the Parliament's Money,</HI> they &s;old their <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI>
and rebelled again&s;t their King <HI>for Hire;</HI> and it
was not many years before, as I have &s;aid
already, they were fully paid the Wages of their.
Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and cha&s;ti&s;ed for their Trea|chery
by the very &s;ame People whom they thus
ba&s;ely a&s;&s;i&s;ted: Then they would have retrieved
it, if it had not been too late.</P>
<P>But I could not but accu&s;e this Age of In|ju&s;tice
and Partiality, who while they reproach|ed
the King for his Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms with the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebls, and not pro&s;ecuting them with the
utmo&s;t Severity, though he was con&s;trained by
the Nece&s;&s;ities of the War to do it, could yet, at
the &s;ame time, ju&s;tify the <HI>Scots</HI> taking up Arms
in a Quarrel they had no Concern in, and again&s;t
their own King, with whom they had articled
and capitulated, and who had &s;o punctually
complied with all their Demands, that they
had no Claim upon him, no Grievances to be
redre&s;&s;ed, no Oppre&s;&s;ion to cry out of, nor could
ask any thing of him which he had not granted.</P>
<P>But as no Action in the World is &s;o vile, but
the Actors can cover with &s;ome &s;pecious Pre|tence,
&s;o the <HI>Scots</HI> now pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>England,</HI>
publi&s;h a Declaration to ju&s;tify their A&s;&s;i&s;ting the
<PB N="231" REF="237">
Parliament: To which I &s;hall only &s;ay, in my
Opinion, it was no Ju&s;tification at all; for admit
the Parliament's Quarrel had been never &s;o
ju&s;t, it could not be ju&s;t in them to aid them,
becau&s;e 'twas again&s;t their own King too, to
whom they had &s;worn Allegiance, or at lea&s;t
had crowned him; and thereby had recognized
his Authority: For if Male-Admini&s;tration be,
according to <HI>Prynn</HI>'s Doctrine, or according to
their own <HI>Buchanan,</HI> a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for Sub|jects
to take up Arms again&s;t their Prince, the
Breach of his Coronation Oath being &s;uppo&s;ed
to di&s;&s;olve the Oath of Allegiance, which <HI>however</HI> I
<HI>cannot believe;</HI> yet this can never be extended to
make it lawful, that becau&s;e a King of <HI>England</HI>
may, by Male-Admini&s;tration di&s;charge the Sub|jects
of <HI>England</HI> from their Allegiance, that
therefore the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> may take up
Arms again&s;t the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he having
not infringed the Compact of Government as
to them, and they having nothing to complain
of for them&s;elves: Thus I thought their own Ar|guments
were again&s;t them, and Heaven &s;eemed
to concur with it; for although they did carry
the Cau&s;e for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rebels, yet the mo&s;t of
them le&s;t there Bones here in the Quarrel.</P>
<P>But what &s;ignifies Rea&s;on to the Drum and
the Trumpet. The Parliament had the &s;u|pream
Argument with tho&s;e Men, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Mo|ney;
and having accordingly advanced a good
round Sum, upon Payment of this, (for the Scots
<HI>would not &s;tir a Foot without it</HI>) they entred <HI>England</HI>
on the 15th of <HI>January</HI> 1643, with an Army of
12000 Men, under the Command of old <HI>Le&s;ley</HI>
now Earl of <HI>Leven,</HI> an old Soldier of great
Experience, having been bred to Arms from a
Youth in the Service of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="238">
The <HI>Scots</HI> were no &s;ooner entred <HI>England,</HI> but
they were joined by all the Friends to the Par|liament
Party in the North; and fir&s;t, Collonel
<HI>Grey,</HI> Brother to the Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> joined them
with a Regiment of Hor&s;e, and &s;everal out of
<HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and &s;o they advan|ced
to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> which they &s;ummoned to &s;urren|der.
The Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who rather &s;aw,
than was able to prevent this Storm, was in
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and did his be&s;t to defend it; but the
<HI>Scots</HI> encrea&s;ed by this time to above 20000,
lay clo&s;e Siege to the Place, which was but
meanly fortified; and having repul&s;ed the Garri|&s;on
upon &s;everal Sallies, and pre&s;&s;ing the Place
very Clo&s;e; after a Siege of 12 Days, or there|abouts,
they enter the Town Sword in Hand.
The Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> got away, and afterwards
gathered what Forces together he could; but
not &s;trong enough to hinder the <HI>Scots</HI> from ad|vancing
to <HI>Durham</HI> which he quitted to them, nor
to hinder the Conjunction of the <HI>Scots</HI> with the
Forces of <HI>Fairfax, Manche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell.</HI> Where|upon
the Earl &s;eeing all things thus going to
wreck, he &s;ends his Hor&s;e away, and retreats
with his Foot into <HI>York,</HI> making all nece&s;&s;ary
Preparations for a vigorous Defence there, in
ca&s;e he &s;hould be attacked, which he was pretty
&s;ure of, as indeed afterwards happened. <HI>York</HI> was
in a very good Po&s;ture of Defence: The Forti|fications
very regular, and exceeding &s;trong;
well furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ions, and had now a
Garri&s;on of 12000 Men in it. The Governour
under the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> was Sir <HI>Thomas Glem|ham,</HI>
a good Souldier, and a Gentleman brave
enough.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> as I have &s;aid, having taken <HI>Dur|ham,
Tinmouth</HI> Ca&s;tle and <HI>Sunderland,</HI> and being
<PB N="233" REF="239">
joined by Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> who had taken <HI>Selby,</HI>
re&s;olve, with their united Strength, to b&s;iege
<HI>York;</HI> but when they came to view the City, and
&s;aw a Plan of the Works, and had Intelligence
of the Strength of the Garri&s;on, they &s;ent Ex|pre&s;&s;es
to <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> for Help,
who came on, and join them with 9000, ma|king
together about 30000 Men, rather more
than le&s;s.</P>
<P>Now had the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s repeated
Me&s;&s;engers convinced the King, that it was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end &s;ome Forces to his
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, or el&s;e all would be lo&s;t in the North.
Whereupon Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was detached with
Orders fir&s;t to go into <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and relieve
<HI>Latham-Hou&s;e,</HI> defended by the brave Counte&s;&s;
of <HI>Derby;</HI> and then taking all the Forces he
could collect in <HI>Che&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire,</HI>
to march to relieve <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince marched from <HI>Oxfor</HI> with but
three Regiments of Hor&s;e, and one of Dragoons,
making in all about 2800 Men. The Collonels
of Hor&s;e were Collonel <HI>Charles Goring,</HI> the Lord
<HI>Biron,</HI> and my &s;elf; the Dragoons were of Col|lonel
<HI>Smith.</HI> In our March we were joined by
a Regiment of Hor&s;e from <HI>Ranbury,</HI> one of Dra|goons
from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and three Regiments of Hor&s;e
from <HI>Che&s;ter:</HI> So that when we came into <HI>Lanca|&s;hire,</HI>
we were about 5000 Hor&s;e Dragoons.
The&s;e Hor&s;e we received from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> were
tho&s;e who having been at the Siege of <HI>Nantwich,</HI>
were obliged to rai&s;e the Siege by Sir <HI>Thomas
Fairfax;</HI> and the Foot having yielded, the Hor&s;e
made good their Retreat to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> being
about 2000; of whom three Regiments now
joined us.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240">
We received al&s;o 2000 Foot from <HI>We&s;t-Che&s;ter,</HI>
and 2000 more out of <HI>Wales;</HI> and with this
Strength we entered <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> We had not
much time to &s;pend, and a great deal of Work
to do.</P>
<P><HI>Bolton</HI> and <HI>Leverpool</HI> felt the fir&s;t Fury of our
Prince: At <HI>Bolton</HI> indeed he had &s;ome Provo|cation;
for here we were like to be beaten off.
When fir&s;t the Prince came to the Town, he
&s;ent a Summons to demand the Town for the
King, but received no An&s;wer but from their
Guns, commanding the Me&s;&s;enger to keep off at
his Peril. They had rai&s;ed &s;ome Works about
the Town, and having by their Intelligence,
learnt that we had no Artillery, and were only
a flying Party, <HI>&s;o they called us,</HI> they contemned
the Summons, and &s;hewed them&s;elves upon their
Ramparts ready for us. The Prince was re&s;olved
to humble them, if po&s;&s;ible, and takes up his
Quarters clo&s;e to the Town. In the Evening
he orders me to advance with one Regiment
of Dragoons, and my Hor&s;e to bring them off,
if Occa&s;ion was, and to po&s;t my &s;elf as near as
po&s;&s;ibly I could to the Lines, yet &s;o as not to
be di&s;covered; and at the &s;ame time having
concluded what Part of the Works to fall upon,
he draws up his Men on two other Sides, as if
he would Storm them there; and on a Signal
I was to begin the real A&s;&s;ault on my Side, with
my Dragoons. I had got &s;o near the Town
with my Dragoons, making them creep upon
their Bellies a great way, that we could hear the
Soldiers talk on the Walls, when the Prince
believing one Regiment would be too few, &s;ends
we Word, that he had ordered a Regiment of
Foot to help, and that I &s;hould not di&s;cover my
&s;elf till they were come up to me. This broke
<PB N="235" REF="241">
our Mea&s;ures; for the March of this Regiment
was di&s;covered by the Enemy, and they took
the Alarm. Upon this I &s;ent to the Prince, to
de&s;ire he would put off the Storm for that
Night, and I would an&s;wer for it the next Day;
but the Prince was impatient, and &s;ent Orders
we &s;hould fall on as &s;oon as the Foot came up
to us. The Foot marching out of the Way,
mi&s;&s;ed us, and fell in with a Road that leads to
another Part of the Town; and being not able
to find us, make an Attack upon the Town
them&s;elves; but the De&s;endants being ready
for them, received them very warmly, and beat
them off with great Lo&s;s. I was at a Lo&s;s now
what to do; for hearing the Guns, and by the
Noi&s;e knowing it was an A&s;&s;ault upon the Town,
I was very unea&s;y to have my Share in it; but
as I had learnt under the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> pun|ctually
to adhere to the Excecution of Orders;
and my Orders being to lye &s;till till the Foot
came up with me; I would not &s;tir if I had been
&s;ure to have done never &s;o much Service; but
however to &s;atisfy my&s;elf, I &s;ent to the Prince
to let him know that I continued in the &s;ame
Place expecting the Foot, and none being yet
come, I de&s;ired farther Orders. The Prince
was a little amazed at this, and finding there
mu&s;t be &s;ome Mi&s;take, came galloping away in
the Dark to the Place, and drew off the Men,
which was no hard Matter, for they were wil|ling
enough to give it over.</P>
<P>As for me, the Prince ordered me to come off
&s;o privately, as not to be di&s;covered, if po&s;&s;ible,
which I effectually did; and &s; we were baulked
for that Night. The next Day the Prince fell on
upon another Quarter with three Regiments
of Foot, but was beaten off with Lo&s;s; and
<PB N="236" REF="242">
the like a third time. At la&s;t, the Prince, <HI>re|&s;olved
to carry it,</HI> doubled his Numbers, and re|newing
the Attack with fre&s;h Men, the Foot
entred the Town over their Works, killing in
the fir&s;t Heat of the Action, all that came in
their way &s;ome of the Foot at the &s;ame
time letting in the Hor&s;e; and &s;o the Town
was entirely won. There was about 600 of
the Enemy killed, and we lo&s;t above 400 in all
which was owing to the fooli&s;h Mi&s;takes we
made. Our Men got &s;ome Plunder here, which
the Parliament made a great Noi&s;e about;
but it was their due, and they bought it dear
enough.</P>
<P><HI>Leverpool</HI> did not co&s;t us &s;o much, nor did
we get &s;o much by it, the People having &s;ent
their Women and Children, and be&s;t Goods
on board the Ships in the Road; and as we
had no Boats to board them with, we could
not get at them. Here, as at <HI>Bolton,</HI> the Town
and Fort was taken by Storm, and the Garri&s;on
were many of them cut in Pieces, which by the
way was their own Faults.</P>
<P>Our next Stop was <HI>Latham-Hou&s;e,</HI> which the
Counte&s;s of <HI>Derby</HI> had gallantly defended above
18 Weeks, again&s;t the Parliament Forces; and
this Lady not only encouraged her Men by her
chearful and noble Maintenance of them, but
by Examples of her own undaunted Spirit, ex|po&s;ing
her &s;elf upon the Walls in the mid&s;t of
the Enemy's Shot, would be with her Men in the
greate&s;t Dangers; and &s;he well de&s;erved our
Care of her Per&s;on; for the Enemy were pre|paired
to u&s;e her very rudely if &s;he fell into
their Hands.</P>
<P>Upon our Approach, the Enemy drew off;
and the Prince not only effectually relieved this
<PB N="237" REF="243">
vigorous Lady, but le&s;t her a good Quantity
of all Sorts of Ammunition, three great Guns,
500 Arms, and 200 Men, commanded by a Ma|jor,
as her extraordinary Guard.</P>
<P>Here the Way being now opened, and our
Succe&s;s an&s;wering our Expectation, &s;everal Bo|dies
of Foot came in to us from <HI>We&s;tmoreland;</HI> and
from <HI>Cumberland;</HI> and here it was that the Prince
found Means to &s;urprize the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle
upon Tyne,</HI> which was recovered for the King, by
the Management of the Mayor of the Town, and
&s;ome loyal Gentlemen of the Country, and a Gar|ri&s;on
placed there again for the King.</P>
<P>But our main De&s;ign being the Relief of <HI>York,</HI>
the Prince advanced that Way a-pace, his Ar|my
&s;till increa&s;ing; and being joined by the
Lord <HI>Goring</HI> from <HI>Richmond&s;hire</HI> with 4000 Hor&s;e,
which were the &s;ame the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> had
&s;ent away when he threw him&s;elf into <HI>York</HI> with
the Infantry. We were now 18000 effective Men,
whereof 10000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons; &s;o the
Prince, full of Hopes, and his Men in good
Heart, boldly marched directly for <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> as much &s;urprized at the taking
of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> as at the coming of their Enemy,
began to enquire which Way they &s;hould get
home, if they &s;hould be beaten; and calling a
Council of War, they all agreed to rai&s;e the
Siege. The Prince, who drew with him a great
Train of Carriages charged with Provi&s;ion and
Ammunition, for the Relief of the City, like a
wary General, kept at a Di&s;tance from the Ene|my,
and &s;etching a great Compa&s;s about, brings
all &s;afe into the City, and enters into <HI>York</HI> him|&s;elf
with all his Army.</P>
<P>No Action of this whole War had gained
the Prince &s;o much Honour, or the King's Af|fairs
<PB N="238" REF="244">
&s;o much Advantage as this, had the Prince
but had the Power to have re&s;trained his Cou|rage
after this, and checked his fatal Eagerne&s;s
for Fighting. Here was a Siege rai&s;ed, the Re|putation
of the Enemy ju&s;tly &s;lurred, a City
relieved and furni&s;hed, with all things nece&s;&s;ary
in the Face of an Army &s;uperior in Number
by near 10000 Men, and commanded by a Tri|umvirate
of Generals <HI>Leven, Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Man|che&s;ter.</HI>
Had the Prince but remembered the
Proceeding of the great Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> at the
Relief of <HI>Paris,</HI> he would have &s;een the relieving
the City was his Bu&s;ine&s;s; 'twas the Enemy's
Bu&s;ine&s;s to fight, if po&s;&s;ible, 'twas his to avoid
it; for, having delivered the City, and put
the Di&s;grace of rai&s;ing the Siege upon the Ene|my,
he had nothing farther to do, but to have
waited till he had &s;een what Cour&s;e the Enemy
would take, and taken his farther Mea&s;ures
from their Motion.</P>
<P>But <HI>the Prince,</HI> a continual Friend to precipi|tant
Coun&s;els, would hear no Advice: I entreated
him not to put it to the Hazard; I told him,
that he ought to con&s;ider if he lo&s;t the Day, he
lo&s;t the Kingdom, and took the Crown off from
the King's Head. I put him in mind that it
was impo&s;&s;ible tho&s;e three Generals &s;hould con|tinue
long together; and that if they did, they
would not agree long in their Coun&s;els: Which
would be as well for us as their &s;eparating.
'Twas plain <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> mu&s;t return
to the a&s;&s;ociated Counties, who would not
&s;uffer them to &s;tay, for fear the King &s;hould
attempt them; That he could &s;ub&s;i&s;t well
enough, having <HI>York</HI> City and River at his
Back; but the <HI>Scots</HI> would eat up the Country,
make them&s;elves odious, and dwindle away to
<PB N="239" REF="245">
nothing, if he would but hold them at Bay a
little; other General Officers were of the &s;ame
Mind; but all I could &s;ay, or they either, to a
Man deaf to any thing but his own Courage,
&s;ignified nothing. He would draw out and fight,
there was no per&s;wading him to the contrary,
unle&s;s a Man would run the Ri&s;que of being
upbraided with being a Coward, and afraid of
the Work. The Enemy's Army lay on a large
Common, called <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> doubtful what to
do: Some were for fighting the Prince, the
<HI>Scots</HI> were again&s;t it, being unea&s;y at having the
Garri&s;on of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> at their Backs; but the
Prince brought their Councils of War to a Re|&s;ult;
for he let them know, they mu&s;t fight
him, whether they would or no; for the Prince
being, <HI>as before,</HI> 18000 Men, and the Earl of
<HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> having joined him with 8000 Foot out
of the City, were marched in Que&s;t of the Ene|my,
had entered the Moor in View of their Ar|my,
and began to draw up in Order of Battle;
but the Night coming on, the Armies only
viewed each other at a Di&s;tance for that time.
We lay all Night upon our Arms, and with the
fir&s;t of the Day were in Order of Battle; the
Enemy was getting ready, but part of <HI>Man|che&s;ter</HI>'s
Men were not in the Field, but lay about
three Miles off, and made a ha&s;ty March to
come up.</P>
<P>The Prince his Army was exceedingly well
managed; he him&s;elf commanded the Left Wing,
the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> the Right Wing; and the
Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> as General of the Foot, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
Major General <HI>Porter,</HI> and Sir <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> led
the main Battle. I had prevailed with the
Prince, according to the Method of the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> to place &s;ome &s;mall Bodies of Mu&s;queteers
<PB N="240" REF="246">
in the Intervals of his Hor&s;e, in the Left Wing,
but could not prevail upon the Earl of <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI>
to do it in the Right; which he after|wards
repented. In this Po&s;ture we &s;tood fa|cing
the Enemy, expecting they would advance
to us, which at la&s;t they did; and the Prince
began the Day by &s;aluting them with his Ar|tillery,
which being placed very well, galled
them terribly for a Quarter of an Hour; they
could not &s;hift their Front, &s;o they advanced
the ha&s;tier to get within our great Guns,
and con&s;equently out of their Danger, which
brought the Fight the &s;ooner on.</P>
<P>The Enemy's Army was thus ordered; Sir
<HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> had the Right Wing, in which
was the <HI>Scots</HI> Hor&s;e, and the Hor&s;e of his own
and his Father's Army; <HI>Cromwell</HI> led the Left
Wing, with his own and the Earl <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s
Hor&s;e, and the three Generals <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> old <HI>Fair|fax,</HI>
and <HI>Mancheter,</HI> led the main Battle.</P>
<P>The Prince, with our Left Wing, fell on fir&s;t,
and, with his u&s;ual Fury, broke, like a Clap
of Thunder, into the Right Wing of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Hor&s;e, led by Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax;</HI> and, as no|thing
could &s;tand in his Way, he broke through
and through them, and entirely routed them,
pur&s;uing them quite out of the Field. Sir <HI>Tho|mas
Fairfax,</HI> with a Regiment of Lances, and
about 500 of his own Hor&s;e, made good the
Ground for &s;ome time; but our Mu&s;queteers,
which, as I &s;aid, were placed among our Hor&s;e
were &s;uch an unlooked for &s;ort of an Article
in a Fight among the Hor&s;e, that tho&s;e Lan|ces,
which otherwi&s;e were brave Fellows, were
mowed down with their Shot, and all was
put into Confu&s;ion. Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> was
wounded in the Face, his Brother killed, and a
<PB N="241" REF="247">
great Slaughter was made of the. <HI>Scots;</HI> to
whom I confe&s;s we &s;hewed no Favour at all.</P>
<P>While this was doing on our Left, the Lord
<HI>Goring</HI> with the main Battle charged the Enemy's
Foot, and particulary one Brigade commanded
by Major General <HI>Porter,</HI> being mo&s;tly Pike|men,
not regarding the Fire of the Ene|my,
charged with that Fury in a clo&s;e Body
of Pikes, that they overturned all that came
in their way, and breaking into the Middle of
the Enemy's Foot, filled all with Terror and
Confu&s;ion, in&s;omuch that the three Generals
thinking all had been lo&s;t, fled, and quitted the
Field.</P>
<P>But Matters went not &s;o well with that <HI>always
&V;nfortunate</HI> Gentleman the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>
and our Right Wing of Hor&s;e; for <HI>Cromwell</HI>
charged the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> with a power|ful
Body of Hor&s;e; and though the Earl, and
tho&s;e about him, did what Men could do, and
behaved them&s;elves with all po&s;&s;ible Gallantry,
yet there was no with&s;tanding <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Hor&s;e;
but, like Prince <HI>Ruport,</HI> they bore down all
before them; and now the Victory was wrung
out of our Hands by our own gro&s;s Mi&s;carriage;
for the Prince, as 'twas his Cu&s;tom, too eager
in the Cha&s;e of the Enemy, was gone, and
could not be heard of: The Foot in the Center,
the Right Wing of the Hor&s;e being routed by
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> was left, and without the Guard of
his Hor&s;e; <HI>Cromwell</HI> having routed the Earl of
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and beaten him quite out of the Field,
and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> rallying his di&s;per&s;ed
Troops, they fall all together upon the Foot.
General Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> like him&s;elf, fought like
a Lion, but, for&s;aken of his Hor&s;e, was hemmed
in on all Sides, and overthrown; and an Hour
<PB N="242" REF="248">
after this, the Prince returning too late to recover
his Friends, was obliged with the re&s;t to quit
the Field to Conquerors.</P>
<P>This was a fatal Day to the King's Affairs,
and the Ri&s;que too much for any Man in his
Wits to run; we lo&s;t 4000 Men on the Spot,
3000 Pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom was Sir <HI>Charles
Lucas,</HI> Major General <HI>Porter,</HI> Major General
<HI>Telier,</HI> and about 170 Gentlemen of Quality.
We lo&s;t all our Baggage, 25 Pieces of Cannon,
300 Carriages, 150 Barrels of Powder, and
10000 Arms.</P>
<P>The Prince got into <HI>York</HI> with the Earl of
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and a great many Gentlemen, and 7
or 8000 of the Men, as well Hor&s;e as Foot.</P>
<P>I had but very cour&s;e Treatment in this
Fight; for returning with the Prince from
the Pur&s;uit of the Right Wing, and finding
all lo&s;t, I halted with &s;ome other Officers, to
con&s;ider what to do: At fir&s;t we were for ma|king
our Retreat in a Body, and might have
done &s;o well enough, if we had known what had
happened, before we &s;aw our &s;elves in the Mid|dle
of the Enemy; for Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> who
had got together his &s;cattered Troops, and joi|ned
by &s;ome of the Left Wing, knowing who we
were, charged us with great Fury. 'Twas not
a Time to think of any thing but getting away,
or dying upon the Spot; the Prince kept on
in the Front, and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> by this
Charge cut off about three Regiments of us
from our Body; but bending his main Strength
at the Prince, left us, as it were, behind him,
in the Middle of the Field of Battle. We took
this for the only Opportunity we could have
to get off, and joining together, we made cro&s;s
the Place of Battle in as good Order as we could,
<PB N="243" REF="249">
with our Carabines pre&s;ented. In this Po&s;ture
we pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal Bodies of the Enemy's Foot,
who &s;tood with their Pikes charged to keep us off;
but they had no Occa&s;ion, for we had no De&s;ign
to meddle with them, but to get from them.
Thus we made a &s;wift March, and thought our
&s;elves pretty &s;ecure, but our Work was not
done yet; for, on a &s;udden, we &s;aw our &s;elves
under a Nece&s;&s;ity of Fighting our Way through
a great Body of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s Hor&s;e, who came
galloping upon us over the Moor. They had as,
we &s;uppo&s;e, been pur&s;uing &s;ome of our broken
Troops, which were fled before, and &s;eeing us,
they gave us a home Charge. We received
them as well as could, but pu&s;hed to get
through them, which at la&s;t we did with a
con&s;iderable Lo&s;s to them. However, we lo&s;t
&s;o many Men, either killed or &s;eparated from
us, (for all could not follow the &s;ame Way)
that of our three Regiments we could not be
above 400 Hor&s;e together, when we got quite
clear, and the&s;e were mixt Men, &s;ome of one
Troop and Regiment, &s;ome of another. Not
that I believe many of us were killed in the
la&s;t Attack; for we had plainly the better of
the Enemy; but our De&s;ign being to get off,
&s;ome &s;hifted for them&s;elves one Way, and &s;ome
another, in the be&s;t Manner they could, and as
their &s;everal Fortunes guided them. 400 more
of this Body, as I afterwards under&s;tood, having
broke through the Enemy's Body another Way,
kept together, and got into <HI>Pontfract</HI> Ca&s;tle,
and 300 more, made Northward, and to
<HI>Skippon,</HI> were the Prince afterwards fetched
them off.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e few of us that were left together, with
whom I was, being now pretty clear of Pur|&s;uit,
<PB N="244" REF="250">
halted, and began to enquire who and
who we were, and what we &s;hould do; and on
a &s;hort Debate, I propo&s;ed we &s;hould make to
the fir&s;t Garri&s;on of the King's that we could
recover; and that we &s;hould keep together,
le&s;t the Country People &s;hould in&s;ult us upon
the Roads. With this Re&s;olution we pu&s;hed
on We&s;tward for <HI>Lanca&s;hire;</HI> but our Misfor|tunes
were not yet at an End: We travelled
very hard, and got to a Village upon the River
<HI>Wharf,</HI> near <HI>Wetherby.</HI> At <HI>Wetherby</HI> there was
a Bridge, but we under&s;tood that a Party from
<HI>Leeds</HI> had &s;ecured the Town and the Po&s;t, in
order to &s;top the flying Cavaliers; and that
'twould be very hard to get through there;
though, as we under&s;tood afterwards, there
were no Soldiers there but a Guard of the
Town&s;men. In this Pickle we con&s;ulted what
Cour&s;e to take; to &s;tay where we were till
Morning, we all concluded would not be &s;afe;
&s;ome advi&s;ed to take the Stream with our
Hor&s;es; but the River, which is deep, and the
Current &s;trong, &s;eemed to bid us have a care
what we did of that Kind, e&s;pecially in the
Night. We re&s;olved therefore to refre&s;h our
&s;elves and our Hor&s;es, <HI>which indeed is more than
we did,</HI> and go on till we might come to a Ford
or Bridge, where we might get over. Some
Guides we had, but they either were fooli&s;h
or fal&s;e; for after we had rid eight or nine Miles,
they plunged us into a River, at a Place they
called a Ford, but 'twas a very ill one; for mo&s;t
of our Hor&s;es &s;wam, and &s;even or eight were
lo&s;t, but we &s;aved the Men; however, we got
all over.</P>
<P>We made bold with our fir&s;t Convenience to
tre&s;pa&s;s upon the Country for a few Hor&s;es,
<PB N="245" REF="251">
where we could find them, to remount our
Men, who&s;e Hor&s;es were drowned, and conti|nued
our March; but being obliged to refre&s;h
our &s;elves at a &s;mall Village on the Edge of
<HI>Bramham-moor,</HI> we found the Country alarmed
by our taking &s;ome Hor&s;es, and we were no
&s;ooner got on Hor&s;eback in the Morning, and
entering on the Moor, but we under&s;tood we
were pur&s;ued by &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e: There
was no Remedy but we mu&s;t pa&s;s this Moor;
and though our Hor&s;es were exceedingly tired,
yet we pre&s;&s;ed on upon a round Trot, and re|covered
an enclo&s;ed Country on the other Side,
where we halted. And here, Nece&s;&s;ity putting
us upon it, we were obliged to look out for
more Hor&s;es, for &s;everal of our Men were di&s;|mounted,
and others Hor&s;es di&s;abled by car|rying
double, tho&s;e who lo&s;t their Hor&s;es get|ting
up behind them; but we were &s;upplied
by our Enemies again&s;t their Will.</P>
<P>The Enemy followed us over the Moor, and
we having a woody enclo&s;ed Country about
us, where we were, I ob&s;erved by their mo|ving,
they had lo&s;t Sight of us; upon which I
propo&s;ed concealing our &s;elves till we might
Judge of their Numbers. We did &s;o, and lying
clo&s;e in a Wood, they pa&s;t ha&s;tily by us, without
skirting or &s;earching the Wood, which was
what on Another Occa&s;ion they would not have
done. I found they were not above 150 Hor&s;e,
and con&s;idering, that to let them go before us,
would be to alarm the Country, and &s;top our
De&s;ign; I thought, &s;ince we might be able to
deal with them, we &s;hould not meet with a
better Place for it, and told the re&s;t of our
Officers my Mind, which all our Party pre&s;ently,
(for we not had Time for a long Debate) agreed
<PB N="246" REF="252">
to. Immediately upon this I cau&s;ed two Men
to fire their Pi&s;tols in the Wood, at two diffe|rent
Places, as far afunder as I could. This I
did to give them an Alarm, and amu&s;e them;
for being in the Lane, they would otherwi&s;e
have got through before we had been ready,
and I re&s;olved to engage them there, as &s;oon as
'twas po&s;&s;ible. After this Alarm, we ru&s;hed
out of the Wood, with about 100 Hor&s;e, and
charged them on the Flank in a broad Lane,
the Wood being on their Right. Our Pa&s;&s;age
into the Lame being narrow, gave us &s;ome
Difficulty in our getting out; but the Surprize
of the Charge did our Work; for the Enemy
thinking we had been a Mile or two before, had
not the lea&s;t Thoughts of this On&s;et, till they
heard us in the Wood, and then they who
were before could not come back. We broke
into the Lane ju&s;t in the Middle of them, and
by that means divided them; and facing to the
Left, charged the Rear. Fir&s;t our di&s;mounted
Men, which were near 50, lined the Edge of
the Wood, and fired with their Carabines upon
tho&s;e which were before, &s;o warmly, that they
put them into a great Di&s;order: Mean while
50 more of our Hor&s;e from the farther Part
of the Wood &s;hewed them&s;elves in the Lane
upon their Front; this put them of the fore|mo&s;t
Party into a great Perplexity, and they
began to face about, to fall upon us who were
engaged in the Rear: But their facing about
in a Lane where there was no Room to wheel,
and one who under&s;tands the Manner of whee|ling
a Troop of Hor&s;e, mu&s;t imagine, put
them into a great Di&s;order. Our Party in the
Head of the Lane taking the Advantage of
this Mi&s;take of the Enemy, charged in upon
<PB N="247" REF="253">
them, and routed them entirely. Some found
means to break into the Enclo&s;ures on the
other Side of the Lane, and get away. About
30 were killed, and about 25 made Pri&s;oners,
and 40 very good Hor&s;es were taken; all this
while not a Man of ours was lo&s;t, and not above
&s;even or eight wounded. Tho&s;e in the Rear
behaved them&s;elves better; for they &s;tood our
Charge with a great deal of Re&s;olution, and
all we could do, could not break them; but
at la&s;t our Men who had fired on Foot through
the Hedges at the other Party, coming to do
the like here, there was no &s;tanding it any lon|ger.
The Rear of them faced about, and re|treated
out of the Lane, and drew up in the
open Field to receive and rally their Fellows.
We killed about 17 of them, and followed them
to the End of the Lane, but had no mind to
have any more fighting than needs mu&s;t; our
Condition at that time not making it proper,
the Towns round us being all in the Enemy's
Hands, and the Country but indifferently plea|&s;ed
with us; however, we &s;tood facing them
till they thought fit to march away. Thus we
were &s;upplied with Hor&s;es enough to remount
our Men, and pur&s;ued our fir&s;t Defign of get|ting
into <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> As for our Pri&s;oners, we
let them go off on Foot.</P>
<P>But the Country being by this time alarmed,
and the Rout of our Army every where known,
we fore&s;aw Abundance of Difficulties before us;
we were not &s;trong enough to venture into
any great Towns, and we were too many to
be concealed in &s;mall ones. Upon this we re|&s;olved
to halt in a great Wood about three
Miles beyond the Place, where we had the la&s;t
Skirmi&s;h, and &s;ent out Scouts to di&s;cover the
<PB N="248" REF="254">
Country, and learn what they could, either of
the Enemy, or of our Friends.</P>
<P>Any Body may &s;uppo&s;e we had but indiffe|rent
Quarters here, either for our &s;elves or for
our Hor&s;es; but however, we made &s;hift to lye
here two Days and one Night. In the interim
I took upon me, with two more, to go to <HI>Leeds</HI> to
learn &s;ome News; we were di&s;gui&s;ed like Coun|try
Ploughmen; the Clothes we got at a Farmer's
Hou&s;e, which for that particular Occa&s;ion we
plundered; and I cannot &s;ay no Blood was &s;hed
in a Manner too ra&s;h, and which I could not
have done at another Time; but our Ca&s;e was
de&s;perate, and the People too &s;urly, and &s;hot
at us out the Window, wounded one Man and
&s;hot a Hor&s;e, which we counted as great a Lof&s;
to us as a Man, for our Safety depended upon our
Hor&s;es. Here we got Clothes of all Sorts enough
for both Sexes, and thus dre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf up <HI>a
la Pai&s;ant,</HI> with a white Cap on my Head, and
a Fork on my Shoulder, and one of my Come|rades
in the Farmer's Wife's Ru&s;&s;et Gown and
Petticoat, like a Woman; the other with an old
Crutch like a lame Man, and all mounted on
&s;uch Hor&s;es as we had taken the Day before
from the Country. Away we go to <HI>Leeds</HI> by
three &s;everal Ways, and agreed to meet upon
the Bridge. My pretended Country Woman
acted her Part to the Life, though the Party
was a Gentleman of good Quality of the Earl
of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>'s Family, and the Cripple did as
well he; but I thought my &s;elf very awkward
in my Dre&s;s, which made me very &s;hy, e&s;peci|ally
among the Soldiers. We pa&s;&s;ed their Cen|tinels
and Guards at <HI>Leeds</HI> unob&s;erved, and put
up our Hor&s;es at &s;everal Hou&s;es in the Town,
from whence we went up and down to make
<PB N="249" REF="255">
our Remarks. My Cripple was the fitte&s;t to
go among the Soldiers, becau&s;e there was le&s;s
Danger of being pre&s;&s;ed: There he informed
him&s;elf of the Matters of War, particularly that
the Enemy &s;at down again to the Siege of <HI>York;</HI>
that flying Parties were in Pur&s;uit of the Ca|valiers;
and there he heard that 500 Hor&s;e of
the Lord <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s Men had followed a Party
of Cavaliers over <HI>Bramham Moor;</HI> and, that en|tering
a Lane, the Cavaliers, who were 1000
&s;trong, fell upon them, and killed them all but
about 50. This, though it was a Lie, was very
plea&s;ant to us to hear, knowing it was our Par|ty,
becau&s;e of the other part of the Story, which
was thus; that the Cavaliers had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of &s;uch a Wood, where they rallied all the
Troops of their flying Army; that they had
plundered the Country as they came, taking all
the Hor&s;es they could get; that they had plun|dered
Goodman <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI>'s Hou&s;e, which was the
Farmer I mentioned, and killed Man, Woman
and Child; and that they were about 2000
&s;trong.</P>
<P>My other Friend in Woman's Clothes got a|mong
the good Wives at an Inn, where &s;he &s;et
up her Hor&s;e, and there &s;he heard the &s;ame &s;ad
and dread&s;ul Tidings; and that this Party was
&s;o &s;trong, none of the neighbouring Garri&s;ons
dur&s;t &s;tir out; but that they had &s;ent Expre&s;&s;es
to <HI>York</HI> for a Party of Hor&s;e to come to their
A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I walked up and down the Town, but fanci|ed
my &s;elf &s;o ill di&s;gui&s;ed, and &s;o ea&s;y to be
known, that I cared not to talk with any Bo|dy.
We met at the Bridge exactly at our Time,
and compared our Intelligence, found it an&s;we|red
our End of coming, and that we had no|thing
<PB N="250" REF="256">
to do but to get back to our Men; but
my Cripple told me, we would not &s;tir till he
bought &s;ome Victuals: So away he hops with
his Crutch, and buys four or five great Pieces
of Bacon, as many of hung Beef, and two or
three Loaves; and, borrowing a Sack at the
Inn (which I &s;uppo&s;e he never re&s;tored,) he
loads his Hor&s;e, and, getting a large Leather
Bottle, he filled that of <HI>Aquavitae</HI> in&s;tead of &s;mall
Beer; my Woman Comerade did the like. I was
unea&s;y in my Mind, and took no Care but to
get out of the Town; however, we all came off
well enough; but 'twas well for me that I had
no Provi&s;ions with me, as you will hear pre|&s;ently.
We came, as I &s;aid, into the Town by
&s;everal Ways, and &s;o we went out; but about
three Miles from the Town we met again ex|actly
where we had agreed: I being about a
Quarter of a Mile from the re&s;t, I meets three
Country Fellows on Hor&s;eback; one had a long
Pole on his Shoulder, another a Fork, the third
no Weapon at all, that I &s;aw; I gave them the
Road very orderly, being habited like one of
their Brethren; but one of them &s;topping &s;hort
at me, and looking earne&s;tly, calls out, <HI>Hark
thee, Friend,</HI> &s;ays he, in a broad North Country
Tone, <HI>whar ha&s;t thou thilk Hor&s;e?</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s
I was in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion at the Que&s;tion,
neither being able to an&s;wer the Que&s;tion, nor
to &s;peak in his Tone, &s;o I made as if I did not
hear him, and went on. <HI>Na, but ye's not gang &s;oa,</HI>
&s;ays the Boor, and comes up to me, and takes
hold of the Hor&s;e's Bridle to &s;top me; at which,
vexed at Heart that I could not tell how to talk
to him, I reached him a great Knock on the Pate
with my Fork, and &s;etched him off of his Hor&s;e,
and then began to mend my Pace. The other
<PB N="251" REF="257">
Clowns, though it &s;eems they knew not what
the Fellow wanted, pur&s;ued me, and, finding
they had better Heels than I, I &s;aw there was
no Remedy but to make u&s;e of my Hands, and
faced about. The fir&s;t that came up with me
was he that had no Weapons, &s;o I thought I might
parley with him; and, &s;peaking as Country like
as I could, I asked him what he wanted? <HI>Thou'st
knaw that &s;oon,</HI> &s;ays <HI>York&s;hire, and I&s;e but come at
thee. Then keep awa' Man,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>or I&s;e brain thee.</HI>
By this Time the third Man came up, and the
Parley ended; for he gave me no Words but
laid at me with his long Pole, and that with
&s;uch Fury, that I began to be doubtful of him:
I was loath to &s;hoot the Fellow, though I had
Pi&s;tols under my grey Frock, as well for that
the Noi&s;e of a Pi&s;tol might bring more People
in, the Village being on our Rear; and al&s;o be|cau&s;e
I could not imagine what the Fellow
meant, or would have; but at la&s;t finding he
would be too many for me with that long Wea|pon,
and a hardy &s;trong Fellow, I threw
my &s;elf off of my Hor&s;e, and running in with
him, &s;tabbed my Fork into his Hor&s;e; the Hor&s;e
being wounded, &s;taggered a while, and then fell
down, and the Booby had not the Sen&s;e to get
down in time, but fell with him; upon which,
giving him a knock or two with my Fork, I
&s;ecured him. The other, by this Time, had fur|ni&s;hed
him&s;elf with a great Stick out of a Hedge,
and, before I was di&s;ingaged from the la&s;t Fellow,
gave me two &s;uch Blows, that if the la&s;t had
not mi&s;&s;ed my Head, and hit me on the Shoul|der,
I had ended the Fight and my Life to|gether.
'Twas time to look about me now,
for this was a mad Man; I defended my &s;elf
with my Fork, but 'twould not do; at la&s;t, in
<PB N="252" REF="258">
&s;hort, I was forced to Pi&s;tol him, and get on
Hor&s;eback again, and, with all the Speed I
could make get away to the Wood to our Men.</P>
<P>If my two Fellow Spies had not been behind,
I had never known what was the Meaning of
this Quarrel of the three Countrymen, but
my Cripple had all the Particulars; for he be|ing
behind us, as I have already ob&s;erved,
when he came up to the fir&s;t Fellow, who be|gan
the Fray, he found him beginning to come
to him&s;elf; &s;o he gets off, and pretends to help
him, and &s;ets him up upon his Breech, and be|ing
a very merry Fellow, talked to him, <HI>Well
and what's the Matter now,</HI> &s;ays he to him, <HI>an
wae's me,</HI> &s;ays the Fellow, <HI>$ is killed: Not quite
Mon,</HI> &s;ays the Cripple. O that's <HI>a fau Thief,</HI>
&s;ays he, and thus they parlied. My Cripple
got him on's Feet, and gave him a Dram of
his <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> Bottle, and made much of him,
in order to know what was the Occa&s;ion of the
Quarrel. Our di&s;gui&s;ed Woman pitied the Fel|low
too, and together they &s;et him up again
upon his Hor&s;e, and then he told him that
that Fellow was got upon one of his Brother's
Hor&s;es who lived at <HI>Wetherby:</HI> They &s;aid the
Cavaliers &s;tole him, but 'twas like &s;uch Rogues;
no Mi&s;chief could be done in the Country, but
'twas the poor Cavaliers mu&s;t bear the Blame,
and the like; and thus they jogged on till they
came to the Place where the other two lay.
The fir&s;t Fellow they a&s;&s;i&s;ted as they had done
t'other, and gave him a Dram out of the Lea|ther
Bottle; but the la&s;t Fellow was pa&s;t their
Care; &s;o they came away: For when they un|der&s;tood
that 'twas my Hor&s;e, they claimed,
they began to be a&s;&s;raid that their own Hor&s;es
might be known too, and then they had been
<PB N="253" REF="259">
betraid in a wor&s;e Pickle than I, and mu&s;t
have been forced to have done &s;ome Mi&s;chief
or other to have got away.</P>
<P>I had &s;ent out two Troopers to fetch them
off, if their was any Occa&s;ion; but their Stay
was not long, and the two Troopers &s;aw
them at a Di&s;tance coming towards us, &s;o they
returned.</P>
<P>I had enough of going for a Spy, and my
Companions had enough of &s;taying in the Wood;
for other Intelligences agreed with ours, and all
concurred in this, that it was time to be going;
however, this U&s;e we made of it, that while
the Country thought us &s;o &s;trong we were in
the lefs Danger of being attacked, though in
the more of being ob&s;erved; but all this while
we heard nothing of our Friends, till the next
Day. We heard Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with about 1000
Hor&s;e, was at <HI>Skipton,</HI> and from thence marched
away to <HI>We&s;tmoreland.</HI></P>
<P>We concluded now we had two or three Days
time good; for, &s;ince Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent to
<HI>York</HI> for a Party to &s;uppre&s;s us, we mu&s;t have
at lea&s;t two Days March of them, and there|fore
all concluded we were to make the be&s;t of
our Way; early in the Morning therefore we
decamped from tho&s;e dull Quarters; and as we
marched through a Village, we found the Peo|ple
very civil to us, and the Woman cried out,
<HI>God ble&s;s them, 'tis pity the Roundheads &s;hould make
&s;uch Woork with &s;uch brave Men,</HI> and the like. Find|ing
we were among our Friends, we re&s;olved to
halt a little and refre&s;h our &s;elves; and, indeed,
the People were very kind to us, gave us Victuals
and Drink, and took Care of our Hor&s;es. It
happened to be my Lot to &s;top at a Hou&s;e where
the good Woman took a great deal of Pains
<PB N="254" REF="260">
to provide for us; but I ob&s;erved the good Man
walked about with a Cap upon his Head, and
very much out of Order, I took no great No|tice
of it, being very &s;leepy, and having asked
my Landlady to let me have a Bed, I lay down
and &s;lept heartily: When I waked I found
my Landlord on another Bed groaning very
heavily.</P>
<P>When I came down Stairs, I found my Crip|ple
talking with my Landlady; he was now out of
his Di&s;gui&s;e, but we called him Cripple &s;till;
and the other, who put on the Woman's Clothes,
we called Goody <HI>Thomp&s;on.</HI> As &s;oon as he &s;aw
me, he called me out, <HI>Do you know,</HI> &s;ays he <HI>the
Man of the Hou&s;e you are quartered in? No, not I,</HI>
&s;ays I. <HI>No, &s;o I believe, nor they you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>if
they did, the good Wife would not have made you a
Po&s;&s;et, and fetched a white Loaf for you. What do
you mean,</HI> &s;ays I. <HI>Have you &s;een the Man</HI> &s;ays he?
<HI>Seen him,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>yes, and heard him too; the Man's
Sick, and groans &s;o heavily,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>that I could not
lye upon the Bed any longer for him. Why, this is
the poor Man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that you knocked down with
your Fork Ye&s;terday, and I have had all the Story out
yonder at the next Door.</HI> I confe&s;s it grieved me to
have been forced to treat one &s;o roughly who
was one of our Friends, but to make &s;ome a|mends,
we contrived to give the poor Man his
Brother's Hor&s;e; and my Cripple told him a
formal Story, that he believed the Hor&s;e was
taken away from the Fellow by &s;ome of our
Men; and, if he knew him again, if 'twas his
Friend's Hor&s;e, he &s;hould have him. The Man
came down upon the News, and I cau&s;ed fix or
&s;even Hor&s;es, which were taken at the &s;ame
time, to be &s;hewn him; he immediately cho&s;e
the right; &s;o I gave him the Hor&s;e, and we
<PB N="255" REF="261">
pretended a great deal of Sorrow for the Man's
Hurt; and that we had not knocked the Fellow
on the Head as well as took away the Hor&s;e.
The Man was &s;o over-joyed at the Revenge he
thought was taken on the Fellow, that we heard
him groan no more. We ventured to &s;tay all
Day at this Town, and the next Night, and got
Guides to lead us to <HI>Black&s;tone Edge,</HI> a Ridge of
Mountains which part this Side of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> from
<HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> Early in the Morning we marched,
and kept our Scouts very carefully out every
Way, who brought us no News for this Day;
we kept on all Night, and made our Hor&s;es do
Penance for that little Re&s;t they had, and the
next Morning we pa&s;&s;ed the Hills, and got into
<HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> to a Town called <HI>Littlebury;</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Rochedale,</HI> a little Market-Town. And
now we thought our &s;elves &s;a&s;e as to the Pur&s;uit
of Enemies from the Side of <HI>York;</HI> our De&s;ign
was to get to <HI>Bolton,</HI> but all the County was
full of the Enemy in flying Parties, and how to
get to <HI>Bolton</HI> we knew not. At la&s;t we re&s;olved
to &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger to <HI>Bolton;</HI> but he came back
and told us, he had with lurking and hiding,
tried all the Ways that he thought po&s;&s;ible, but
to no Purpo&s;e; for he could not get into the
Town. We &s;ent another, and he never retur|ned;
and &s;ome time after we under&s;tood he was
taken by the Enemy. At lo&s;t one got into the
Town, but brought us Word, they were tired
out with con&s;tant Alarms, had been &s;traitly
blocked up, and every Day expected a Siege,
and therefore advi&s;ed us either to go North|ward,
where Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Go|ring</HI>
ranged at Liberty; or to get over <HI>Warring|ton</HI>
Bridge, and &s;o &s;ecure our Retreat to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI>
This double Direction divided our Opinions; I
<PB N="256" REF="262">
was for getting into <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> both to recruit my
&s;elf with Hor&s;es and with Money, both which
I wanted, and to get Refre&s;hment, which we all
wanted; but the major Part of our Men were
for the North. Fir&s;t they &s;aid, there was their
General, and 'twas their Duty to the Cau&s;e,
and the King's Intere&s;t obliged us to go
where we could do be&s;t Service; and there
was their Friends, and every Man might hear
&s;ome News of his own Regiment, for we belonged
to &s;everal Regiments; be&s;ides, all the Towns to
to the Left of us, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Sir <HI>William
Brereton, Warrington</HI> and <HI>Northwich,</HI> Garri&s;oned by
the Enemy, and a &s;trong Party at <HI>Manche&s;ter;</HI> &s;o
that 'twas very likely we &s;hould be beaten and
di&s;per&s;ed before we could get to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e
Rea&s;ons, and e&s;pecially the la&s;t, determined us
for the North, and we had re&s;olved to march
the next Morning, when other Intelligence
brought us to more &s;peedy Re&s;olutions. We kept
our Scouts continually abroad, to bring us In|telligence
of the Enemy, whom we expected on
our Backs, and al&s;o to keep an Eye upon the
Country; for as we lived upon them &s;omething
at large, they were ready enough to do us any
ill Turn, as it lay in their Power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Me&s;&s;enger that came to us, was from
our Friends at <HI>Bolton,</HI> to inform us, that they
were preparing at <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> to attack us: One
of our Parties had been as far as <HI>Stockport,</HI> on
the Edge of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and was pur&s;ued by a Party
of the Enemy, but got off by the Help of the
Night. Thus all things looking black to the
South, we had re&s;olved to march Northward
in the Morning, when one of our Scouts from
the Side of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> a&s;&s;ured us, Sir <HI>Thomas Mid|dleton,</HI>
with &s;ome of the Parliament Forces, and
<PB N="257" REF="263">
the Country Troops, making above 1200 Men,
were on their March to attack us, and would
certainly beat up our Quarters that Night, Up|on
this Advice we re&s;olved to be gone; and
getting all things in Readine&s;s, we began to
march about two Hours before Night: And
having gotten a tru&s;ty Fellow for a Guide, a
Fellow that we found was a Friend to our Side,
he put a Project into my Head, which &s;aved us
all for that time; and that was, to give out in
the Village, that we were marched back to <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI>
re&s;olving to get into <HI>Pontfract</HI> Ca&s;tle; and
accordingly he leads us out of the Town the
&s;ame way we came in; and taking a Boy with
him, he &s;ends the Boy back ju&s;t at Night, and
bad him &s;ay he &s;aw us go up the Hills at <HI>Black|&s;tone-Edge;</HI>
and it happened very well; for this
Party were &s;o &s;ure of us, that they had placed
400 Men on the Road to the Northward, to
intercept our Retreat that Way, and had left
no Way for us, as they thought, to get away,
but back again.</P>
<P>About Ten a Clock at Night, they a&s;&s;aulted
our Quarters, but found we were gone; and be|ing
informed which way, they followed upon
the Spur, and travelling all Night, being Moon-Light,
they found them&s;elves the next Day
about 15 Miles Ea&s;t, ju&s;t out of their Way; for
we had by the Help of our Guide, turned &s;hort
at the Foot of the Hills, and through blind, un|trodden
Paths, and with Difficulty enough, by
Noon the next Day, had reached almo&s;t 25
Miles North near a Town called <HI>Clithero.</HI> Here
we halted in the open Field, and &s;ent out our
People to &s;ee how things were in the Country.
This Part of the Country almo&s;t unpa&s;&s;able,
and walled round with Hills, was indifferent
quiet, and we got &s;ome Refre&s;hment for our
<PB N="258" REF="264">
&s;elves, but very little Hor&s;emeat, and &s;o went
on; but we had not marched far before we found
our &s;elves di&s;covered; and the 400 Hor&s;e &s;ent to
lye in wait for us as before, having underftood
which way we went, followed us hard; and by
Letters to &s;ome of their Friends at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> we
found we were be&s;et again. Our Guide began
now to be out of his Knowledge, and our Scouts
brought us Word, the Enemy's Hor&s;e was po&s;ted
before us, and we knew they were in our Rear.
In this Exigence, we re&s;olved to divide our
&s;mall Body, and &s;o amu&s;ing them, at lea&s;t one
might get off, if the other mi&s;carried. I took
about 80 Hor&s;e with me, among which were
all that I had of our own Regiment, amounting
to above 32, and took the Hills towards <HI>York|&s;hire.</HI>
Here we met with &s;uch unpa&s;&s;able Hills,
va&s;t Moors, Rocks, and &s;tony Ways, as lamed
all our Hor&s;es, and tired our Men; and &s;ome|times
I was ready to think we &s;hould never be
able to get over them, till our Horfes failing, and
Jack-boots being but indifferent things to tra|vel
in, we might be &s;tarved before we &s;hould
find any Road, or Towns, (for Guide we had
none) but a Boy who knew but little, and would
cry, when we asked him any Que&s;tions. I believe
neither Men nor Hor&s;es ever pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ome Pla|ces
where we went, and for 20 Hours we &s;aw
not a Town nor a Hou&s;e, excepting &s;ometimes
from the Top of the Mountains, at a vaft Di|&s;tance.
I am per&s;waded we might have encam|ped
here, if we had had Provi&s;ions, till the War
had been over, and have met with no Di&s;tur|bance;
and I have o&s;ten wondered &s;ince, how we
got into &s;uch horrible Places, as much as how got
out. That which was wor&s;e to us than all the
reft, was, that we knew not where we were going,
<PB N="259" REF="265">
nor what Part of the Country we &s;hould come
into, when we came out of tho&s;e de&s;olate Craggs.
At la&s;t, after a terrible Fatigue, we began to
&s;ee the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> &s;ome &s;ew Vil|lages,
and the Country at a Di&s;tance, looked
a little like <HI>England;</HI> for I thought before it
looked like old <HI>Brennus</HI> Hill, which the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> call
the Grandfather of the <HI>Alps.</HI> We got &s;ome
Relief in the Villages, which indeed &s;ome of us
had &s;o much need of, that they were hardly able
to &s;it their Hor&s;es, and others were forced to
help them off, they were &s;o faint. I never &s;elt &s;o
much of the Power of Hunger in my Life; for
having not eaten in 30 Hours, I was as ravenous
as a Hound; and if I had had a Piece of Hor&s;e|fle&s;h,
I believe I &s;hould not have had Patience to
have &s;taid Dre&s;&s;ing it, but have fallen upon
it raw, and have eaten it as greedily as a
<HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
<P>However, I eat very cautiou&s;ly, having o&s;ten
&s;een the Danger of Mens eating heartily after
long Fa&s;ting. Our next Care was to enquire out
Way. <HI>Hallifax,</HI> they told us, was on our right;
there we dur&s;t not think of going; <HI>Skippon</HI> was
before us, and there we knew not how it was;
for a Body of 3000 Hor&s;e, &s;ent out by the Enemy
in Pur&s;uit of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> had been there but
two Days before, and the Country People could
not tell us, whether they were gone, or no:
And <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s Hor&s;e, which were &s;ent out
after our Party, were then at <HI>Hallifax,</HI> in Que&s;t
of us, and afterwards marched into <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> In
this Di&s;tre&s;s we would have hired a Guide,
but none of the Country People would go with
us; for the Roundheads would hang them, they
faid, when they came there. Upon this I called
a Fellow to me, <HI>Harke ye friend,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>do&s;t thee
<PB N="260" REF="266">
know the Way &s;o as to bring us into</HI> We&s;tmoreland,
<HI>and not keep the great Road from</HI> York? <HI>Ay merry,</HI> &s;ays
he, <HI>I ken the Ways weel enou; and you would go and
guide us,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>but that you are afraid the Roundheads
will bang you? Indeed would I,</HI> &s;ays the Fellow. <HI>Why
then,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>thou had&s;t as good be hanged by a Round|head
as a Cavalier; for if thou wilt not go, I'll hang
thee ju&s;t now. Na, and ye &s;erve me &s;oa,</HI> &s;ays the Fel|low,
<HI>I&s;e ene gang with ye; for I care not for Hang|ing;
and ye'l get me a good Hor&s;e, I&s;e gang and be one
of ye, for I'll nere come heame mere.</HI> This plea&s;ed
us &s;till better, and we mounted the Fellow;
for three of our Men died that Night with
the extreme Fatigue of the la&s;t Service.</P>
<P>Next Morning, when our new Trooper was
mounted and cloathed, we hardly knew him;
and this Fellow led us by &s;uch Ways, &s;uch
Wilderne&s;&s;es, and yet with &s;uch Prudence,
keeping the Hills to the left, that we might
have the Villages to re&s;re&s;h our &s;elves, that
without him, we had certainly either peri&s;hed
in tho&s;e Mountains, or fallen into the Enemy's
Hands. We pa&s;&s;ed the great Road from <HI>York</HI> &s;o
critically as to time, that from one of the Hills
he &s;hewed us a Party of the Enemy's Hor&s;e,
who were then marching into <HI>We&s;tmoreland.</HI> We
lay &s;till that Day, finding we were not di&s;cove|red
by them; and our Guide proved the be&s;t
Scout that we could have had; for he would go
out ten Miles at a time, and bring us in all the
News of the Country: Here he brought us
word, that <HI>York</HI> was &s;urrendered upon Articles,
and that <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> which had been &s;urprized
by the King's Party, was be&s;ieged by another
Army of <HI>Scots</HI> advanced to help their Brethren.</P>
<P>Along the Edges of tho&s;e va&s;t Mountains we
pa&s;t with the Help of our Guide, till we came
<PB N="261" REF="267">
into the Fore&s;t of <HI>Swale;</HI> and finding our &s;elves
perfectly concealed here, for no Soldier had
ever been here all the War, nor perhaps would
not, if it had la&s;ted 7 Years; we thought we
wanted a few Days Re&s;t, at lea&s;t for our Hor&s;es,
&s;o we re&s;olved to halt, and while we did &s;o,
we made &s;ome Di&s;gui&s;es, and &s;ent out &s;ome
Spies into the Country; but as here were no
great Towns, nor no Po&s;t Road, we got very little
Intelligence. We re&s;ted four Days, and then
marched again; and indeed having no great
Stock of Money about us, and not very free of
that we had, four Days was enough for tho&s;e
poor Places to be able to maintain us.</P>
<P>We thought our &s;elves pretty &s;ecure now;
but our chief Care was how to get over tho&s;e
terrible Mountains; for having pa&s;&s;ed the great
Road that leads from <HI>York</HI> to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the
Craggs, the farther Northward we looked,
look'd &s;till the wor&s;e, and our Bu&s;ine&s;s was all
on the other Side. Our Guide told us, he would
bring us out, if we would have Patience, which
we were obliged to, and kept on this &s;low
March, till he brought us to <HI>Stanhope,</HI> in the
County of <HI>Durham;</HI> where &s;ome of <HI>Goring</HI>'s
Hor&s;e, and two Regiments of Foot, had their
Quarters: This was 19 Days from the Battle
of <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor.</HI> The Prince who was then at
<HI>Kendal</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and who had given me
over as lo&s;t, when he had News of our Arrival,
&s;ent an Expre&s;s to me, to meet him at <HI>Appleby.</HI>
I went thither accordingly, and gave him an
Account of our Journey, and there I heard the
&s;hort Hi&s;tory of the other Part of our Men,
whom we parted from in <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> They made
the be&s;t of their way North; they had two
re&s;olute Gentlemen who commanded; and be|ing
<PB N="262" REF="268">
&s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the Enemy, that they
found them&s;elves under a Nece&s;&s;ity of Fighting,
they halted, and faced about, expecting the
Charge. The Boldne&s;s of the Action made the
Officer who led the Enemy's Hor&s;e (which it
&s;eems were the County Hor&s;e only) afraid of
them; which they perceiving, taking the Advan|tage
of his Fears, bravely advance, and charge
them; and, though they were above 200 Hor&s;e,
they routed them, killed about 30 or 40, got
&s;ome Hor&s;es, and &s;ome Money, and pu&s;hed on
their March Night and Day; but coming near
<HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> they were &s;o way-laid and pur&s;ued,
that they agreed to &s;eparate, and &s;hirt every
Man for him&s;elf; many of them fell into the
Enemy's Hands; &s;ome were killed attempting
to pa&s;s through the River <HI>Lune;</HI> &s;ome went
back again, &s;ix or &s;even got to <HI>Bolton,</HI> and about
18 got &s;afe to Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince was in a better Condition here|abouts
than I expected; he and my Lord <HI>Goring.</HI>
with the Help of Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and
the Gentlemen of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> had gotten a Body
of 4000 Hor&s;e, and about 6000 Foot; they had
retaken <HI>Newca&s;tle, Iinmouth, Durham, Stockton,</HI>
and &s;everal Towns of Con&s;equence from the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and might have cut them out Work
enough &s;till, if that ba&s;e People, re&s;olved to
engage their whole Intere&s;t to ruine their Sove|reign,
had not &s;enta &s;econd Army of 10000 Men,
under the Earl of <HI>Calender,</HI> to help their fir&s;t.
The&s;e came and laid Siege to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> but
found more vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance now than they
had done before.</P>
<P>There were in the Town Sir <HI>John Morley,</HI> the
Lord <HI>Crawford,</HI> Lord <HI>Rea,</HI> and <HI>Maxwell, Scots;</HI>
and old Soldiers, who were re&s;olved their Coun|trymen
<PB N="263" REF="269">
&s;hould buy the Town very dear if they
had it; and had it not been for our Di&s;a&s;ter at
<HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> they had never had it; for <HI>Calen|der,</HI>
finding he was not able to carry the Town,
&s;ends to General <HI>Levin</HI> to come from the Siege
of <HI>York</HI> to help him.</P>
<P>Mean time the Prince forms a very good
Army, and the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> with 10000 Men
&s;hews him&s;elf on the Borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to try
if that might not cau&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> to recal their
Forces; and, I am per&s;waded had he entered
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> had recalled
the Earl of <HI>Calender,</HI> for they had but 5000 Men
le&s;t in Arms to &s;end again&s;t him; but they were
loath to venture.</P>
<P>However, this Effect it had, that it called the
<HI>Scots</HI> Northward again, and found them Work
there for the re&s;t of the Summer, to reduce the
&s;everal Towns in the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>I found with the Prince the poor Remains of
my Regiment, which when joined with tho&s;e
that had been with me, could not all make up
three Troops, and but two Captains, three Lieu|tenants,
and one Cornet; the re&s;t were di&s;per|&s;ed,
killed, or taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>However, with tho&s;e, which we &s;till called a
Regiment, I joined the Prince, and after ha|ving
done all we could on that Side, the <HI>Scots</HI> be|ing
returned from <HI>York,</HI> the Prince returned
through <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy often appeared and alarmed us,
and once fell on one of our Parties, and killed
us about a hundred Men; but we were too many
for them to pretend to fight us, &s;o we came to
<HI>Bolton,</HI> beat the Troops of the Enemy near <HI>War|rington,</HI>
where I got a Cut with a Halbard in
<PB N="264" REF="270">
my Face, and arrived at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> the beginning
of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament, upon their great Succe&s;s in
the North, thinking the King's Forces quite
broken, had &s;ent their General <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> into the
We&s;t, where the King's Army was comman|ded
by Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s elder Bro|ther,
but not very &s;trong; and the King being,
as they &s;uppo&s;ed, by the Ab&s;ence of Prince <HI>Ru|pert,</HI>
weakened &s;o much as, that he might be
checked by Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> who, with 4500
Foot, and 1500 Hor&s;e, was at that Time about
<HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> having lately beaten Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton.</HI>
Upon all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
marches We&s;tward.</P>
<P>The Forces in the We&s;t being too weak to
oppo&s;e him, every thing give way to him, and
all People expected he would be&s;iege <HI>Exeter,</HI>
where the Queen was newly lying in, and &s;ent
a Trumpet to de&s;ire he would forbear the City,
while &s;he could be removed; which he did, and
pa&s;&s;ed on We&s;tward, took <HI>Tiverton, Biddeford,
Barn&s;tble, Lance&s;ton,</HI> relieved <HI>Plymouth,</HI> drove Sir
<HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> up into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and followed
him thither, but le&s;t Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> behind
him with 4000 Men about <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> and <HI>Exe|ter.</HI>
The King, in the mean time, marches
from <HI>Oxford</HI> into <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> with <HI>Waller</HI> at his
Heels; at <HI>Edgehill</HI> his Maje&s;ty turns upon <HI>Waller,</HI>
and gave him a Bru&s;h, to put him in mind of
the Place; the King goes on to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> &s;ends
300 Hor&s;e to relieve <HI>Durley</HI> Ca&s;tle, be&s;ieged
by the Earl of <HI>Denby,</HI> and &s;ending Part of his
Proces to <HI>Bri&s;ral,</HI> returns to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty had now firmly re&s;olved to march
into the We&s;t, not having yet any Account of
<PB N="265" REF="271">
our Mis&s;ortunes in the North. <HI>Waller</HI> and <HI>Mid|dleton</HI>
way-lay the King at <HI>Cropedy</HI> Bridge;
The King a&s;&s;aults <HI>Middleton</HI> at the Bridge; <HI>Wal|ler</HI>'s
Men were po&s;ted with &s;ome Cannon to guard
a pa&s;s; <HI>Middleton</HI>'s Men put a Regiment of the
King's Foot to the Rout, and pur&s;ued them:
<HI>Waller</HI>'s Men, willing to come in for the Plun|der,
a thing their General had often u&s;ed them
to, quit their Po&s;t at the Pa&s;s, and their great.
Guns, to have Part in the Victory. The King
coming in &s;eaonably to the Relief of his Men,
routs <HI>Middleton,</HI> and at the &s;ame time &s;ends a
Party round, who clapt in between Sir <HI>Wil|liam
Waller's</HI> Men and their great Guns, and &s;ecur|ed
the Pa&s;s and the Cannon too.</P>
<P>The King took three Collonels, be&s;ides other
Officers, and about 300 Men Pri&s;oners, with
eight great Guns, 19-Carriages of Ammunition,
and killed about 200 Men.</P>
<P><HI>Waller</HI> lo&s;t his Reputation in this Fight, and
was exceedingly &s;lighted ever after, even by
his own Party; but e&s;pecially by &s;uch as were
of General <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Party, between whom and
<HI>Waller</HI> there had been Jealou&s;ies and Mi&s;under|&s;tandings
for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>The King, about 8000 &s;trong, marched on to
<HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where Sir <HI>William Hopton</HI> joined him; and
from thence he follows <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> into <HI>Cornwall; E&s;&s;ex</HI>
&s;till following <HI>Greenvil,</HI> the King comes to <HI>Exeter,</HI>
and joining with Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> re&s;olves to
pur&s;ue <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and now the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> began
to &s;ee his Mi&s;take, being cooped up between
two Seas, the King's Army in his Rear, the
Country his Enemy, and Sir <HI>Richard Grenvil</HI> in
his Van.</P>
<P>The King, who always took the be&s;t Mea&s;ures,
when he was left to his own Coun&s;el, wi&s;ely
<PB N="266" REF="272">
refu&s;es to engage, though &s;uperior in Number,
and much &s;tronger in Hor&s;e. <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> often drew
out to fight, but the King fortifies, takes the
Pa&s;&s;es and Bridges, Plants Cannon, and &s;ecures
the Country to keep off Provi&s;ions, and conti|nually
&s;treightens their Quarters, but would
not fight.</P>
<P>Now <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;ends away to the Parliament for
Help, and they write to <HI>Waller,</HI> and <HI>Middleton,</HI>
and <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> to follow, and come up with the
King in his Rear; but &s;ome were too far off, and
could not, as <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Fairfax;</HI> others
made no Ha&s;te, as having no mind to it, as <HI>Wal|ler</HI>
and <HI>Middleton,</HI> and if they had, it had been
too late.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> finding nothing to be
done, and unwilling to fall into the King's Hands,
takes Shipping, and leaves his Army to &s;hift
for them&s;elves. The Hor&s;e, under Sir <HI>Wil|tion
Balfour,</HI> the be&s;t Hor&s;e-Officer, and, with|out
Compari&s;on, the brave&s;t in all the Parlia|ment
Army, advanced in &s;mall Parties, as if to
Skirmi&s;h, but following in with the whole
Body, being 3500 Hor&s;e, broke through, and
got off. Though this was a Lo&s;s to the King's
Victory, yet the Foot were now in a Condition
&s;o much the wor&s;e. Brave old <HI>Skippon</HI> propo&s;ed
to fight through with the Foot and die, as he
called, it, like <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, with Sword in Hand;
but the re&s;t of the Officers &s;hook their Heads
at it; for, being well paid, they had at pre&s;ent no
Occa&s;ion for dying.</P>
<P>Seeing it thus, they agreed to treat, and the
King grants them Conditions, upon laying down
their Arms, to march off free. This was too
much; had his Maje&s;ty but obliged them upon
Oath not to &s;erve again for a certain Time, he
<PB N="267" REF="273">
had done his Bu&s;ine&s;s; but this was not thought
of; &s;o they pa&s;&s;ed free, only di&s;armed, the
Soldiers not being allowed &s;o much as their
Swords.</P>
<P>The King gained by this Treaty 40 Pieces of
Cannon, all of Bra&s;s, 300 Barrels of Gunpowder,
9000 Arms, 8000 Swords, Match and Bullet
in Proportion, 200 Waggons, 150 Colours and
Standards, all the Bag and Baggage of the Army,
and about 1000 of the Men li&s;ted in his Army.
This was a compleat Victory without Blood|&s;hed;
and, had the King but &s;ecured the Men
from &s;erving but for &s;ix Months, it had mo&s;t
effectually an&s;wered the Battle of <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor.</HI></P>
<P>As it was, it infu&s;ed new Life into all his
Maje&s;ty's Forces and Friends, and retrieved
his Affairs very much; but e&s;pecially it encou|raged
us in the North, who were more &s;en&s;i|ble
of the Blow received at <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> and of
the De&s;truction the <HI>Scots</HI> were bringing upon
us all.</P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> we had &s;ome &s;mall
Skirmi&s;hes with Sir <HI>William Brereton.</HI> One Mor|ning
in particular Sir <HI>William</HI> drew up, and
faced us, and one of our Collonels of Hor&s;e
ob&s;erving the Enemy to be not, as he thought,
above 200, de&s;ires Leave of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to
attack them with the like Number, and accor|dingly
he &s;allied out with 200 Hor&s;e. I &s;tood
drawn up without the City with 800 more,
ready to bring him off, if he &s;hould be put to
the wor&s;t, which happened accordingly; for,
not having di&s;covered neither the Country nor
the Enemy as he ought, Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI>
drew him into an Ambu&s;cade; &s;o that before
he came up with Sir <HI>William</HI>'s Forces, near
enough to charge, he finds about 300 Hor&s;e
<PB N="268" REF="274">
of my Father's Hou&s;e, I might &s;oon recruit it,
my Father having got &s;ome Men together
already, I defired Leave to lye at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> for
a Month, to make up my Men. Accordingly
having obtained his Leave, I marched to <HI>Wrex|ham,</HI>
where, in two Days time I got 20 Men,
and &s;o on to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> I had not been here
above 10 Days, but I received an Expre&s;s to
come away with what Recruits I had got to|gether,
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> having po&s;itive Orders to
meet the King by a certain Day. I had not
mounted 100 Men, though I had li&s;ted above
200, when the&s;e Orders came; but leaving
my Father to compleat them for me, I marched
with tho&s;e I had, and came to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>The King, after the Rout of the Parliament
Forces in the We&s;t, was marched back, took
<HI>Barn&s;table, Plympton, Lance&s;ton, Tiverton,</HI> and &s;e|veral
other Places, and left <HI>Plymouth</HI> be&s;ieged
by Sir <HI>Richard Grenvil,</HI> met with Sir <HI>William Wal|ler</HI>
at <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and again at <HI>Andover,</HI> and
boxed him at both Places, and marched for
<HI>Newberry.</HI> Here the King &s;ent for Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>
to meet him, who with 3000 Hor&s;e made long
Marches to join him; but the Parliament ha|ving
joined their three Armies together, <HI>Man|chefter</HI>
from the North, <HI>Waller</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the
Men being cloathed and armed, from the We&s;t,
had attacked the King, and obliged him to
fight the Day, before the Prince came up.</P>
<P>The King had &s;o po&s;ted him&s;elf, as that he
could not be obliged to fight but with Advan|tage;
the Parliament's Forces being &s;uperior
in Number, and therefore, when they attacked
him, he galled them with his Cannon, and de|clining
to come to a general Battle, &s;tood upon
<PB N="269" REF="275">
in his Reat: Though he was &s;urprized at this,
yet, being a Man of a ready Courage, he boldly
faces about with 150 of his Men, leaving the
other 50 to face Sir <HI>William.</HI> With this &s;mall
Party, he de&s;perately charges the 300 Hor&s;e in
his Rear, and putting them into Di&s;order,
breaks through them, and, had there been no
greater Force, he had cut them all in Pieces-Flu&s;hed
with this Succe&s;s, and loath to de&s;ert
the 50 Men he had left behind, he faces about
again, and charges through them again, and with
the&s;e two Charges entirely routs them. Sir
<HI>William Brereton</HI> finding him&s;elf a little di&s;ap|pointed,
advances, and falls upon the 50 Men
ju&s;t as the Collonel came up to them; they
fought him with a great deal of Bravery, but
the Collonel being unfortunately killed in the
fir&s;t Charge, the Men gave Way, and came
flying all in Confu&s;ion, with the Enemy at
their Heels. As &s;oon as I &s;aw this, I advanced,
according to my Orders, and the Enemy, as
&s;oon as I appeared, gave over the Pur&s;uit. This
Gentleman, as I remember, was Collonel <HI>Mor|rough;</HI>
we fetched off his Body, and retreated
into <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning the Prince drew out of the
City with about 1200 Hor&s;e and 2000 Foot,
and attacked Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> in his Quar|ters.
The Fight was very &s;harp for the time,
and near 700 Men, on both Sides, were killed;
but Sir <HI>William</HI> would not put it to a general
Engagement, &s;o the Prince drew off, contenting
him&s;elf to have in&s;ulted him in his Quarters.</P>
<P>We now had received Orders from the King
to join him; but I repre&s;enting to the Prince
the Condition of my Regiment, which was
now 100 Men, and, that being within 25 Miles
<PB N="270" REF="276">
the Defen&s;ive, expecting Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with
the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Parliament's Forces had &s;ome Advantage
over our Foot, and took the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI>
Pri&s;oner; but the King, who&s;e Foot were not
above one to two, drew his Men under the
Cannon of <HI>Dennington</HI> Ca&s;tle, and having &s;ecured
his Artillery and Baggage, made a Retreat with
his Foot in very good Order, having not lo&s;t
in all the Fight above 300 Men, and the Par|liament
as many: We lo&s;t five Pieces of Can|non
and took two, having repul&s;ed the Earl of
<HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s Men on the North Side of the
Town, with con&s;iderable Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The King, having lodged his Train of Ar|tillery
and Baggage in <HI>Dennington</HI> Ca&s;tle, mar|ched
the next Day for <HI>Oxford;</HI> there we joined
him with 3000 Hor&s;e, and 2000 Foot. Encou|raged
with this Reinforcement, the King
appears upon the Hills on the North-we&s;t of
<HI>Newberry,</HI> and faces the Parliament Army. The
Parliament having too many Generals as well
as Soldiers, they could not agree whether they
&s;hould fight or no. This was no great Token
of the Victory they boa&s;ted of; for they were
now twice our Number in the whole, and their
Foot three for one. The King &s;tood in Battalia
all Day, and finding the Parliament Forces had
no Stomach to engage him, he drew away his
Cannon and Baggage out of <HI>Dennington</HI> Ca&s;tle,
in View of their whole Army, and marched
away to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>This was &s;uch a fal&s;e Step of the Parliament's
Generals, that all the People cried &s;hame of
them: The Parliament appointed a Committee
to enquire into it. <HI>Cromwell</HI> accu&s;ed <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="277">
and he <HI>Waller,</HI> and &s;o they laid the Fault upon
one another. <HI>Waller</HI> would have been glad to
have charged it upon <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> but as it happened
he was not in the Army, having been taken ill
&s;ome Days before; but, as it generally is when
a Mi&s;take is made, the Actors fall out among
them&s;elves, &s;o it was here. No doubt it was
as fal&s;e a Step as that of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> to let the King
fetch away his Baggage and Cannon in the
Face of three Armies, and never fire a Shot
at them.</P>
<P>The King had not above 8000 Foot in his
Army, and they above 25000; 'Tis true, the
King had 8000 Hor&s;e, a fine Body, and much
&s;uperior to theirs; but the Foot might, with
the greate&s;t Ea&s;e in the World, have prevented
the removing the Cannon, and in three Days
time have taken the Ca&s;tle, with all that was
in it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Differences produced their Self-deny|ing
Ordinance, and the putting by mo&s;t of their
old Generals, as <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Waller, Manche&s;ter,</HI> and the
like; and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> a terrible Man in
the Field, though the milde&s;t of Men out of it,
was voted to have the Command of all their
Forces, and <HI>Lambert</HI> to take the Command of
Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI>'s Troops in the North, old
<HI>Skippon</HI> being Major General.</P>
<P>This Winter was &s;pent on the Enemy's Side
in modelling, as they called it, their Army;
and, on our Side, in recruiting ours, and &s;ome
petty Excur&s;ions. Among&s;t the many Addre&s;|&s;es,
I ob&s;erved one from <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> or <HI>Surrey,</HI> complain|ing
of the Rudene&s;s of their Soldiers, and par|ticularly
of the ravi&s;hing of Women, and the
murthering of Men; from which I only ob&s;er|ved,
that there were Di&s;orders among them, as
<PB N="272" REF="278">
well as among us, only with this Difference,
that they, for Rea&s;ons I mentioned before, were
under Circum&s;tances to prevent it better than
the King; But I mu&s;t do the King's Memory
that Ju&s;tice, that he u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Methods,
by Puni&s;hment of Soldiers, charging; and &s;ome|times
entreating, the Gentlemen not to &s;uffer
&s;uch Di&s;orders and &s;uch Violences in their Men;
but it was to no Purpo&s;e for his Maje&s;ty to at|tempt
it, while his Officers, Generals, and Great
Men, winked at it; for the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of
the Soldier is &s;uppo&s;ed to be approved by the
Officer, when it is not corrected.</P>
<P>The Rudene&s;s of the Parliament Soldiers be|gan
from the Divi&s;ions among their Officers;
for, in many Places, the Soldiers grew &s;o out
of all Di&s;cipline, and &s;o un&s;ufferably rude, that
they in particular refu&s;ed to march when Sir
<HI>William Waller</HI> went to <HI>Weymouth.</HI> This had tur|ned
to good Account for us, had the&s;e cur&s;ed
<HI>Scots</HI> been out of our way, but they were the
Staff of the Party; and now they were daily
&s;ollicited to march Southward, which was a ve|ry
great Affliction to the King, and all his
Friends.</P>
<P>One Booty the King got at this time, which
was a very &s;ea&s;onable A&s;&s;i&s;tance to his Affairs,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) a great Merchant Ship richly laden at
<HI>London,</HI> and bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> was, by the
Seamen, brought into <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and delivered up
to the King. Some Merchants in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> offered
the King 40000 1. for her, which his Maje&s;ty or|dered
&s;hould be accepted, re&s;erving only 30 great
Guns for his own U&s;e.</P>
<P>The Treaty at <HI>&V;xbridge</HI> now was begun, and
we that had been well beaten in the War, hear|tily
wi&s;hed the King would come to a Peace;
<PB N="273" REF="279">
but we all fore&s;aw the Clergy would ruine it all.
The Commons were for Presbytery, and would
never agree the Bi&s;hops &s;hould be re&s;tored; the
King was willinger to comply with any thing than
this, and we fore&s;aw it would be &s;o; from whence
we u&s;ed to &s;ay among our &s;elves, <HI>That the Clergy
was re&s;olved if there &s;hould be no Bi&s;hop, there &s;hould
be no King.</HI></P>
<P>This Treaty at <HI>&V;xbridge</HI> was a Perfect War
between the Men of the Gown, ours was be|tween
tho&s;e of the Sword; and I cannot but
take Notice how the Lawyers, State&s;men, and
the Clergy of every Side be&s;tirred them&s;elves,
rather to hinder than promote the Peace.</P>
<P>There had been a Treaty at <HI>Oxford</HI> &s;ome time
before, where the Parliament in&s;i&s;ting that the
King &s;hould pa&s;s a Bill to aboli&s;h Epi&s;copacy,
quit the Militia, abandon &s;everal of his faithful
Servants to be exempted from Pardon, and ma|king
&s;everal other mo&s;t extravagant Demands.
Nothing was done, but the Trea&s;y broke off, both
Parties being rather farther ex&s;perated, than
$n clined to hearken to Conditions.</P>
<P>However, &s;oon after the Succe&s;s in the We&s;t,
his Maje&s;ty, to let them &s;ee that Victory had
not puffed him up &s;o as to make him reject the
Peace, &s;ends a Me&s;&s;age to the Parliament, to
put them in Mind of Me&s;&s;ages of like Nature
which they had &s;lighted; and to let them know,
that notwith&s;tanding he had beaten their Forces,
he was yet willing to hearken to a rea&s;onable
Propo&s;al for putting an End to the War.</P>
<P>The Parliament pretended the King, in his
Me&s;&s;age, did not treat with them as a legal Par|liament,
and &s;o made He&s;itations; but after long
Debates and Delays they agreed to draw up
Propo&s;itions for Peace to be &s;ent to the King.
<PB N="274" REF="280">
As this Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to the Hou&s;es about
<HI>August,</HI> I think they made it the middle of <HI>No|vember</HI>
before they brought the Propo&s;itions for
Peace; and, when they brought them, they had
no Power to enter either upon a Treaty, or &s;o
much as Preliminaries for a Treaty, only to de|liver
the Letter, and receive an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>However, &s;uch were the Circum&s;tances of Af|fairs
at this Time, that the King was unea&s;y
to &s;ee him&s;elf thus treated, and take no Notice
of it: The King returned an An&s;wer to the
Propo&s;itions, and propo&s;ed a Treaty by Commi&s;|&s;ioners
which the Parliament appointed.</P>
<P>Three Months more were &s;pent in naming
Commi&s;&s;ioners. There was much Time &s;pent
in this Treaty, but little done; the Commi&s;&s;io|ners
debated chiefly the Article of Religion, and
of the Militia; in the latter they were very
likely to agree, in the former both Sides &s;ee|med
too po&s;itive. The King would by no Means
abandon Epi&s;copacy, nor the Parliament Pre|sbytery;
for both in their Opinion were <HI>&s;ure
Divino.</HI></P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;inding this Point harde&s;t
to adju&s;t, went from it to that of the Militia;
but the Time &s;pinning out, the King's Commi&s;|&s;ioners
demanded longer Time for the Treaty;
the other &s;ent up for In&s;tructions, but the Hou&s;e
re&s;u&s;ed to lengthen out the Time.</P>
<P>This was thought an In&s;olence upon the King,
and gave all good People a Dete&s;tation of &s;uch
haughty Behaviour; and thus the Hopes of
Peace vani&s;hed, both Sides prepared for War
with as much Eagerne&s;s as before.</P>
<P>The Parliament was employed at this Time in
what they called a Modelling their Army; that
is to &s;ay, that now the Independent Party be|ginning
<PB N="275" REF="281">
to prevail; and, as they outdid all the
others in their Re&s;olution of carrying on the
War to all Extremities, &s;o they were both the
more vigorous and more politick Party in car|rying
it on.</P>
<P>Indeed the War was after this carried on with
greater Annimo&s;ity than ever, and the Generals
pu&s;hed forward with a Vigour, that, as it had
&s;omething in it unu&s;ual, &s;o it told us plainly
from this Time, whatever they did before, they
now pu&s;hed at the Ruine even of Monarchy
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>All this while al&s;o the War went on, and
though the Parliament had no &s;ettled Army, yet
their Regiments and Troops were always in
Action; and the Sword was at work in every Part
of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Among an infinite Number of Party Skir|mi&s;hings
and Fights this Winter, one happened
which nearly concerned me, which was the Sur|prize
of the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> Col|lonel
<HI>Mitton,</HI> with about 1200 Hor&s;e and Foot,
having Intelligence with &s;ome People in the Town,
on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning early broke into the Town,
and took it, Ca&s;tle and all. The Lo&s;s for the Qua|lity,
more than the Number, was very great to
the King's Affairs. They took there 15 Pieces
of Cannon, Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s Magazine of Arms
and Ammunition, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Baggage, above
50 Per&s;ons of Quality and Officers: There was
not above 8 or 10 Men killed on both Sides;
for the Town was &s;urprized, not &s;tormed. I had
a particular Lo&s;s in this Action; for, all the
Men and Hor&s;es my Father had got together
for the recruiting my Regiment, were here lo&s;t
and di&s;per&s;ed; and, which was the wor&s;e, my
Father happening to be then in the Town, was
<PB N="276" REF="282">
taken Pri&s;oner, and carried to <HI>Bee&s;ton</HI> Ca&s;tle in
<HI>Che&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>I was quartered all this Winter at <HI>Banbury,</HI>
and went little abroad; nor had we any Action
till the latter end of <HI>February,</HI> when I was or|dered
to march to <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> with Sir <HI>Marmaduke
Langdale,</HI> in order, as we thought, to rai&s;e a
Body of Men in that County and <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> to
join the King.</P>
<P>We lay at <HI>Daventry</HI> one Night, and continu|ing
our March to pa&s;s the River above <HI>Northam|pton,</HI>
that Town being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Enemy,
we under&s;tood a Party of <HI>Northampton</HI> Forces
were abroad, and intended to attack us: Ac|cordingly
in the Afternoon our Scouts brought
us Word, the Enemy were quartered in &s;ome
Villages on the Road to <HI>Coventry;</HI> our Comman|der
thinking it much better to &s;et upon them
in their Quarters, than to wait for them in the
Field, re&s;olves to attack them early in the Mor|ning,
before they were aware of it. We refre|&s;hed
our &s;elves in the Field for that Day, and
getting into a great Wood near the Enemy, we
&s;tayed there all Night, till almo&s;t break of Day,
without being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>In the Morning very early we heard the Ene|my's
Trumpets &s;ound to Hor&s;e; this rou&s;ed us
to look abroad; and, &s;ending out a Scout, he
brought us Word a Party of the Enemy was at
Hand. we were vexed to be &s;o di&s;appointed,
but finding their Party &s;mall enough to be dealt
with, Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> ordered me to charge them
with 300 Hor&s;e and 200 Dragoons, while he at
the &s;ame Time entered the Town. According|ly
I lay &s;till till they came to the very Skirt of the
Wood where I was po&s;ted, when I &s;aluted them
with a Volley from my Dragoons out of the
<PB N="277" REF="283">
Wood, and immediately &s;hewed my &s;elf with
my Hor&s;e on their Front, ready to charge them;
they appeared not to be &s;urprized, and received
our Charge with great Re&s;olution; and, being
above 400 Men, they pu&s;hed me vigorou&s;ly in
their Turn, putting my Men into &s;ome Di&s;or|der.
In this Extremity I &s;ent to order the Dra|goons
to charge them in the Flank, which they
did with great Bravery, and the other &s;till main|tained
the Fight with de&s;perate Re&s;olution.
There was no want of Courage in our Men on
both Sides; but our Dragoons had the Advan|tage,
and at la&s;t routed them, and drove them
back to the Village. Here Sir <HI>Marmaduke Lang|dale</HI>
had his Hands full too; for my firing had
alarmed the Towns adjacent, that when he came
into the Town, he found them all in Arms; and,
contrary to his Expectation, two Regiments of
Foot, with about 500 Hor&s;e more. As Sir <HI>Mar|maduke</HI>
had no Foot, only Hor&s;e and Dragoons,
this was a Surprize to him; but he cau&s;ed his
Dragoons to enter the Town, and charge the
Foot, while his Hor&s;e &s;ecured the Avenues of
the Town.</P>
<P>The Dragoons bravely attacked the Foot, and
Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> falling in with his Hor&s;e, the
Fight was ob&s;tinate and very bloody, when the
Hor&s;e that I had routed came flying into the
Street of the Village, and my Men at their Heels.
Immediately I left the Pur&s;uit, and fell in with
all my Force to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Friends,
and, after an ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance, we routed the
whole Party; we killed about 700 Men, took
350, 27 Officers, 100 Arms, all their Baggage,
and 200 Hor&s;es, and continued our March to
<HI>Harborough,</HI> where we halted to refre&s;h our &s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="284">
Between <HI>Harborough</HI> and <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> we met with
a Party of 800 Dragoons of the Parliament
Forces. They found them&s;elves too few to at|tack
us, and therefore to avoid us, they had
gotten into a &s;mall Wood; but perceiving them|&s;elves
di&s;covered, they came boldly out, and
placed them&s;elves at the Entrance into a Lane,
lining both Sides of the Hedges with their
Shot. We immediately attacked them, beat
them from their Hedges, beat them into the
Wood, and out of the Wood again, and forced
them at la&s;t to a down right <HI>Run-away,</HI> on Foot,
among the Enclo&s;ures, where we could not fol|low
them, killed about 100 of them, and took
250 Pri&s;oners, with all their Hor&s;es, and came
that Night to <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI> When we came to
<HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and had taken up our Quarters, Sir <HI>Mar|maduke
Langdale</HI> &s;ent for me to &s;up with him,
and told me, that he had a &s;ecret Commi&s;&s;ion
in his Pocket, which his Maje&s;ty had commanded
him not to open 'till he came to <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> that
now he had &s;ent for me to open it together,
that we might know what it was we were to do,
and to con&s;ider how to do it; &s;o pulling out his
&s;ealed Orders, we found we were to get what
Force we could together, and a certain Num|ber
of Carriages with Ammunition which the
Governour of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> was to deliver us, and a
certain Quantity of Provi&s;ion, e&s;pecally Corn
and Salt, and to relieve <HI>Newark.</HI> This Town had
been long be&s;ieged: The Fortifications of the
Place, together with its Situation, had rendered
it the &s;tronge&s;t Piece in <HI>England;</HI> And, as it was
the greate&s;t Pa&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o it was of va&s;t
Con&s;equence to the King's Affairs. There was
in it a Garri&s;on of brave old rugged Boys, Fel|lows,
that, like Count <HI>Tilly</HI>'s <HI>Germans,</HI> had Iron
<PB N="279" REF="285">
Faces, and they had defended them&s;elves with
extraordinary Bravery a great while, but were
reduced to an exceeding Streight for want of
Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Accordingly we received the Ammunition
and Provi&s;ion, and away we went for <HI>Newark;</HI>
about <HI>Melton Mowbray,</HI> Collonel <HI>Ro&s;eter</HI> &s;et upon
us, with above 3000 Men; we were about the
&s;ame Number, having 2500 Hor&s;e, and 800
Dragoons. We had &s;ome Foot, but they were
&s;till at <HI>Harborough,</HI> and were ordered to come
after us.</P>
<P><HI>Ro&s;eter,</HI> like a brave Officer, as he was, charged
us with great Fury, and rather outdid us in
Number, while we defended our &s;elves with all
the Eagerne&s;s we could, and withal gave him
to under&s;tand we were not &s;o &s;oon to be beaten
as he expected. While the Fight continued doubt|ful,
e&s;pecially on our Side, our People, who had
charge of the Carriages and Provi&s;ions, began
to enclo&s;e our Flanks with them, as if we had
been marching; which, though it was done
without Orders, had two very good Effects, and
which did us extraordinary Service. Fir&s;t, it
&s;ecured us from being charged in the Flank,
which <HI>Ro&s;eter</HI> had twice attempted; and, Se|condly,
it &s;ecured our Carriages from being
plundered, which had &s;poiled our whole Ex|pedition.
Being thus enclo&s;ed, we fought with
great Security; and though <HI>Ro&s;eter</HI> made three
de&s;perate Charges upon us, he could never
break us. Our Men received him with &s;o much
Courage, and kept their Order &s;o well, that
the Enemy finding it impo&s;&s;ible to force us,
gave it over, and left us to pur&s;ue our Orders.
We did not offer to cha&s;e them, but contented
enough to have repul&s;ed and beaten them off
<PB N="280" REF="286">
and our Bu&s;ine&s;s being to relieve <HI>Newark,</HI>
we proceeded.</P>
<P>If we are to reckon by the Enemy's u&s;ual
Method, we got the Victory, becau&s;e we kept
the Field, and had the Pillage of their Dead;
but otherwi&s;e, neither Side had any great Cau&s;e
to boa&s;t. We lo&s;t about 150 Men, and near as
many hurt; they left 170 on the Spot, and
carried off &s;ome. How many they had wounded
we could not tell; we got 70 or 80 Hor&s;e,
which helped to remount &s;ome of our Men
that had lo&s;t theirs in the Fight. We had,
however, this Di&s;advantage, that we were to
march on immediately after this Service; the
Enemy only to retire to their Quarters, which
was but hard by. This was an Injury to our
wounded Men, who we were after obliged to
leave at <HI>Belvoir</HI> Ca&s;tle, and from thence we ad|vanced
to <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>Our Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Newark</HI> was to relieve the
Place, and this we re&s;olved to do, whatever it
co&s;t, though, at the &s;ame Time, we re&s;olved
not to fight, unle&s;s we were forced to it. The
Town was rather blocked up than be&s;ieged;
the Garri&s;on was &s;trong, but ill provided; we had
&s;ent them word of our coming to them, and our
Orders to relieve them, and they propo&s;ed &s;ome
Mea&s;ures for our doing it. The chief Strength
of the Enemy lay on the other Side of the River;
but they having al&s;o &s;ome Notice of our De&s;ign,
had &s;ent over Forces to &s;trengthen their Lea|guer
on this Side. The Garri&s;on had often &s;ur|prized
them by Sallies, and indeed had chiefly
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time by what they brought
in on this Manner.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> who was our General
for the Expedition, was for a general Attempt
<PB N="281" REF="287">
to rai&s;e the Siege; but I had per&s;waded him off
of that: Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e if we &s;hould be beaten,
as might be probable, we then lo&s;t the Town.
Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> briskly replied, <HI>A Soldier ought
never to &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hall be beaten. But, Sir, &s;ays I,
you'll get more Honour by relieving the Town, than by
beating them: One will be a Credit to your Conduct, as
the other will be to your Courage; and, if you think you
can beat them, you may do it afterward, and then if you
are mi&s;taken, the Town is neverthele&s;s &s;ecured, and
half your Victory gained.</HI></P>
<P>He was prevailed with to adhere to this Ad|vice,
and accordingly we appeared before the
Town about two Hours before Night. The
Hor&s;e drew up before the Enemy's Works; the
Enemy drew up within their Works, and &s;eeing
no Foot, expected when our Dragoons would
di&s;mount and attack them. They were in the
right to let us attack them, becau&s;e of the
Advantage of their Batteries and Works, if
that had been our De&s;ign; but, as we intended
only to amu&s;e them, this Caution of theirs ef|fected
our De&s;ign; for, while we thus faced
them with our Hor&s;e, two Regiments of Foot,
which came up to us but the Night before, and
was all the Infantry we had, with the Waggons
of Provi&s;ions, and 500 Dragoons, taking a Com|pa&s;s
clean round the Town, po&s;ted them&s;elves
on the lower Side of the Town by the River. Up|on
a Signal the Garri&s;on agreed on before, they
fallied out at this very Juncture, with all the
Men they could &s;pare, and dividing them&s;elves
in two Parties, while one Party moved to the
Left to meet our Relief, the other Party fell
on upon Part of that Body which faced us. We
kept in Motion, and upon this Signal advanced
to their Works, and our Dragoons fired upon
<PB N="282" REF="288">
them; and the Hor&s;e wheeling and counter-marching
often, kept them continually expect|ing
to be attacked. By this Means the Enemy
were kept employed, and our Foot with the
Waggons, appearing on that Quarter where
they were lea&s;t expected, ea&s;ily defeated the
advanced Guards, and forced that Po&s;t, where
entring the Leaguer, the other Part of the Gar|ri&s;on,
who had &s;allied that way, came up to
them, received the Waggons, and the Dragoons
entered with them into the Town. That Party
which we faced on the other Side of the Works;
knew nothing of what was done till all was
over; the Garri&s;on retreated in good Order,
and we drew off, having fini&s;hed what we came
for without fighting.</P>
<P>Thus we plentifully &s;tored the Town with all
things wanting, and with an Addition of 500
Dragoons to their Garri&s;on; after which we
marched away without fighting a Stroke. Our
next Orders were to relieve <HI>Pontfract</HI> Ca&s;tle,
another Garri&s;on of the King's, which had been
be&s;ieged ever &s;ince a few Days after the Fight
at <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> by the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> Sir
<HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> and other Generals in their
Turn.</P>
<P>By the Way, we were joined with 800 Hor&s;e
out of <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> and &s;ome Foot, &s;o many as
made us, about 4500 Men in all.</P>
<P>Collonel <HI>Forbes,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> commanded at the
Siege, in the Ab&s;ence of the Lord <HI>Fairfax;</HI> the
Collonel had &s;ent to my Lord for more Troops,
and his Lord&s;hip was gathering his Forces to
come up to him; but he was plea&s;ed to come
too late. We came up with the Enemy's Lea|guer
about Break of Day, and having been
di&s;covered by their Scouts, they, with more
<PB N="283" REF="289">
Courage than Di&s;cretion, drew out to meet us.
We &s;aw no Rea&s;on to avoid them, being &s;tronger
in Hor&s;e than they; and though we had but a
few Foot, we had 1000 Dragoons, which helped us
out. We had placed our Hor&s;e and Foot through|out
in one Line, with two Re&s;erves of Hor&s;e, and
between every Divi&s;ion of Hor&s;e, a Divi&s;ion of
Foot, only that on the Extremes of our Wings,
there were two Parties of Hor&s;e on each Point
by them&s;elves, and the Dragoons in the Center,
on Foot. Their Foot charged us home, and &s;tood
with Pu&s;h of Pike a great while; but their Hor&s;e
charging our Hor&s;e and Mu&s;queteers, and be|ing
clo&s;ed on the Flanks with tho&s;e two exten|ded
Troops on our Wings, they were pre&s;ently
di&s;ordered, and fled out of the Field. The Foot
thus de&s;erted, were charged on every Side,
and broken. They retreated &s;till fighting, and
in good Order, for a while; but the Garri&s;on
&s;allying upon them at the &s;ame Time, and being
followed clo&s;e by our Hor&s;e, they were &s;cat|tered,
entirely routed, and mo&s;t of them killed.
The Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> was come with his Hor&s;e as
far as <HI>Ferribridge,</HI> but the Fight was over; and
all he could do was to rally tho&s;e that fled, and
&s;ave &s;ome of their Carriages, which el&s;e had
fallen into our Hands. We drew up our little
Army in Order of Battle the next Day, expect|ing
the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> would have charged us;
but his Lord&s;hip was &s;o far from any &s;uch
Thoughts, that he placed a Party of Dragoons,
with Orders to fortify the Pa&s;s at <HI>Ferribridge,</HI>
to prevent our falling upon him in his Retreat,
which he needed not have done; for, having rai|&s;ed
the Siege of <HI>Pontfract,</HI> our Bu&s;ine&s;s was done,
we had nothing to &s;ay to him, unle&s;s we had
been &s;trong enough to &s;tay.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="290">
We lo&s;t not above 30 Men in this Action,
and the Enemy 300, with about 150 Pri&s;oners,
one Piece of Cannon, all their Ammunition,
1000 Arms, and mo&s;t of their Baggage, and
Collonel <HI>Lambert</HI> was once taken Pri&s;oner, be|ing
wounded, but got off again.</P>
<P>We brought no Relief for the Garri&s;on, but
the Opportunity to furni&s;h them&s;elves out of
the Country, which they did very plentifully.
The Ammunition taken from the Enemy was
given to them, which they wanted, and was
their Due, for they had &s;iezed it in the Sally they
made, before the Enemy was quite defeated.</P>
<P>I cannot omit taking Notice, on all Occa&s;ions,
how exceeding &s;erviceable this Method was of
po&s;ting Mu&s;queteers in the Intervals, among the
Hor&s;e, in all this War: I per&s;waded our Generals to
it, as much as po&s;&s;ible, and I never knew a Body of
Hor&s;e beaten that did &s;o; yet I had great
Difficulty to prevail upon our People to believe
it, though it was taught me by the greate&s;t
General in the World, (viz.) the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI>
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> did it at the Battle <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor;</HI>
and had the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> not been ob&s;tinate
again&s;t it in his Right Wing, as I ob&s;erved be|fore,
the Day had not been lo&s;t. In di&s;cour&s;ing
this with Sir <HI>Marmakuke Langdale,</HI> I had related
&s;everal Examples of the Serviceablene&s;s of the&s;e
&s;mall Bodies of Firemen, and, with great Diffi|culty,
brought him to agree, telling him, I
would be an&s;werable for the Succe&s;s; but, after
the Fight, he told me plainly he &s;aw the Ad|vantage
of it, and would never fight otherwi&s;e
again, if he had any Foot to place. So having
relieved the&s;e two Places, we ha&s;tened, by long
Marches, through <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> to join Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>
on the Edge of <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> We found
<PB N="285" REF="291">
Collonel <HI>Ro&s;eter</HI> had followed us at a Di&s;tance,
ever &s;ince the Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Melton Mowbray,</HI> but
never cared to attack us, and we found he did
the like &s;till. Our General would fain have
been doing with him again, but we found him
too &s;hy. Once we laid a Trap for him at <HI>Dove-Bridge,</HI>
between <HI>Derby</HI> and <HI>Burton upon Trent,</HI> the
Body being marched two Days before; 300
Dragoons were left to guard the Bridge, as if
we were afraid he &s;hould fall upon us. Upon
this we marched, as I &s;aid, on to <HI>Burton,</HI> and,
the next Day, fetching a Compa&s;s round, came
to a Village near <HI>Titbury</HI> Ca&s;tle, who&s;e Name I
forgot, were we lay &s;till expecting our Dra|goons
would be attacked.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Collonel, &s;trengthned with
&s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e from <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> comes up
to the Bridge, and finding fome Dragoons po|&s;ted,
advances to charge them: The Dragoons
immediately get a Hor&s;eback, and run for it,
as they were ordered; but the old Lad was not
to be caught &s;o; for he halts immediately at
the Bridge, and would not come over till he
had &s;ent three or four flying Parties abroad, to
di&s;cover the Country. One of the&s;e Parties
fell into our Hands, and received but coar&s;e
Entertainment. Finding the Plot would not take,
we appeared, and drew up in View of the Bridge
but he would not &s;tir: So we continued our
March into <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> where we joined Prince
<HI>Rupert,</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> making together a
fine Body, being above 8000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons.</P>
<P>This was the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Expe|dition
I was in during this War. 'Twas well
concerted, and executed with as much Expedition
and Conduct as could be de&s;ired, and the
Succe&s;s was an&s;werable to it: And indeed, con|&s;idering
<PB N="286" REF="292">
the Sea&s;on of the Year (for we &s;et out
from <HI>Oxford</HI> the latter end of <HI>February</HI>) the Ways
bad, and the Sea&s;on wet, it was a terrible
March of above 200 Miles, in continual Action,
and continually dodged and ob&s;erved by a vi|gilant
Enemy, and at a Time when the North
was over-run by their Armies, and the <HI>Scots</HI>
wanting Employment for their Forces; yet in
le&s;s than 23 Days, we marched 200 Miles,
fought the Enemy in open Field four Times,
relieved one Garri&s;on be&s;ieged, and rai&s;ed the
Siege of another, and joined our Friends at la&s;t
in Safety.</P>
<P>The Enemy was in great Pain for Sir <HI>William
Brereton</HI> and his Forces, and Expre&s;&s;es rid
Night and Day to the <HI>Scots</HI> in the North, and
to the Parties in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> to come to his Help.
The Prince, who u&s;ed to be rather too forward
to fight than otherwi&s;e, could not be per&s;waded
to make u&s;e of this Opportunity, but loitered,
if I may be allowed to &s;ay &s;o, till the <HI>Scots,</HI> with
a Brigade of Hor&s;e and 2000 Foot, had joined
him; and then 'twas not thought proper to
engage them.</P>
<P>I took this Opportunity to go to <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>
to vi&s;it my Father, who was a Pri&s;oner of War
there, getting a pa&s;s from the Enemy's Gover|nour.
They allowed him the Liberty of the
Town, and &s;ometimes to go to his own Hou&s;e,
upon his Parole, &s;o that his Confinement was not
very much to his per&s;onal Injury; but this, to|gether
with the Charges he had been at in rai|&s;ing
the Regiment, and above 20000 l. in Money
and Plate, which at &s;everal Times he had lent,
or given rather, to the King, had reduced our
Family to very ill Circum&s;tances; and now they
talked of cutting down his Woods.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="293">
I had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e with my Fa|ther
on this Affair; and finding him extremely
concerned, I offered to go to the King, and de&s;ire
his Leave to go to <HI>London,</HI> and treat about
his Compo&s;ition, or to render my &s;elf a Pri&s;o|ners
in his &s;tead, while he went up him&s;elf|In
this Difficulty I treated with the Governour
of the Town, who very civilly offered me his
Pa&s;s to go for <HI>London,</HI> which I accepted; and
waiting on Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was then at <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI>
I acquainted him with my De&s;ign. The
Prince was unwilling I &s;hould go to <HI>London;</HI>
but told me, he had &s;ome Pri&s;oners of the Par|liament's
Friends in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and he would
get an Exchange for my Father. I told him,
if he would give me his Word for it, I knew I
might depend upon it, otherwi&s;e there was &s;o
many of the King's Party in their Hands, that
his Maje&s;ty was tired with Sollicitations for Ex|changes;
for we never had a Pri&s;oner but there
was ten Offers of Exchanges for him. The
Prince told me, I &s;hould depend upon him; and
he was as good as his Word quickly after.</P>
<P>While the Prince lay at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> he made an
Incur&s;ion into <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and having made
&s;ome of the Gentlemen Pri&s;oners, brought them
to <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> and though it was an Action
which had not been u&s;ual, they being Per&s;ons
not in Arms, yet the like being my Father's
Ca&s;e, who was really not in Commi&s;&s;ion, nor
in any Military Service, having re&s;igned his
Regiment three Years before to me, the Prince
in&s;i&s;ted on exchanging them for &s;uch as the
Parliament had in Cu&s;tody in like Circum&s;tan|ces.
The Gentlemen &s;eeing no Remedy, &s;ol|licited
their own Ca&s;e at the Parliament, and
got it pa&s;&s;ed in their behalf; and by this Means
<PB N="288" REF="294">
my Father got his Liberty; and, by the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of the Earl of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> got Leave to
come to <HI>London</HI> to make a Compo&s;ition, as a
Delinquent, for his E&s;tate. This they charged at
7000l. but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ame noble
Per&s;on, he got off for 4000l. Some Members of
the Committee moved very kindly, that my
Father &s;hould oblige me to quit the King's Ser|vice;
but that, as a thing which might be out
of his Power, was not in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>The Modelling the Parliament Army took
them up all this Winter, and we were in great
Hopes the Divi&s;ions which appeared among&s;t
them might have weakened their Party; but
when they voted Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> to be Ge|neral,
I confe&s;s I was convinced the King's
Affairs were lo&s;t and de&s;perate. Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> a|bating
the Zeal of his Party, and the mi&s;taken
Opinion of his Cau&s;e, was the fitte&s;t Man
among&s;t them to undertake the Charge: He
was a compleat General, &s;trict in his Di&s;cipline,
wary in Conduct, fearle&s;s in Action, unwearied in
the Fatigue of the War, and withal, of a mode&s;t,
noble, generous Di&s;po&s;ition. We all aprehend|ed
Danger from him, and heartily wi&s;hed him of
our own Side; and the King was &s;o &s;en&s;ible,
though he would not di&s;cover it, that when
an Account was brought him of the Choice
they had made, he replied, <HI>he was &s;orry for it; he
had rather it had been any Body than he.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Attempts of this new General and
new Army were at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which, by the
Neighbourhood of a numerous Garri&s;on in <HI>A|bingdon,</HI>
began to be very much &s;treightned for
Provi&s;ions; and the new Forces under <HI>Cromwell</HI>
and <HI>Skippon,</HI> one Lieutenant General, the other
Major General to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> approaching with a
<PB N="289" REF="295">
De&s;ign to block it up, the King left the Place,
&s;uppo&s;ing his Ab&s;ence would draw them away,
as it &s;oon did.</P>
<P>The King re&s;olving to leave <HI>Oxford,</HI> marches
from thence with all his Forces, the Garri&s;on
excepted, with De&s;ign to have gone to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
but the Plague was in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which altered the
Mea&s;ures, and changed the Cour&s;e of the
King's De&s;igns, &s;o he marched for <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> about
the begining of <HI>June</HI> 1645. The Foot with a
Train of 40 Pieces of Cannon, marching into
<HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> the Hor&s;e &s;tayed behind &s;ome time
in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Action our Army did, was to rai&s;e
the Siege of <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> had be|&s;ieged
it, or rather blocked it up, and when his
Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> he &s;ent Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
with 4000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, with Orders
to join &s;ome Foot out of <HI>Wales,</HI> to rai&s;e the Siege;
but Sir <HI>William</HI> thought fit to withdraw, and
not &s;tay for them, and the Town was freed
without fighting. The Governour took Care in
this Interval to furni&s;h him&s;elf with all things
nece&s;&s;ary for another Siege; and, as for Am|munition
and other Nece&s;&s;aries, he was in
no Want.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent with a Party into <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI>
with De&s;ign to intercept a Convoy of Stores
coming from <HI>London,</HI> for the U&s;e of Sir <HI>Willia
Brereton;</HI> but they having &s;ome Notice of the
De&s;ign, &s;topt, and went out of the Road to
<HI>Burton upon Trent,</HI> and &s;o I mi&s;&s;ed them; but that
we might not come back quite empty, we
attacked <HI>Hawke&s;ly</HI> Hou&s;e, and took it, where
we got good Booty, and brought 80 Pri&s;oners
back to <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> From <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> the King ad|vanced
into <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and took his Head Quar|ters
<PB N="290" REF="296">
at <HI>Bridgenorth.</HI> This was a very happy
March of the King's, and had his Maje&s;ty pro|ceeded,
he had certainly cleared the North
once more of his Enemies, for the Country was
generally for him. At his advancing &s;o far as
<HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> fled up into
<HI>Lanca&s;hire;</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Brigades who were with
him retreated into the North, while yet the
King was above 40 Miles from them, and all
things lay open for Conque&s;t. The new Ge|nerals,
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> lay about <HI>Oxford</HI>
preparing as if they would be&s;iege it, and gave
the King's Army &s;o much Lei&s;ure, that his
Maje&s;ty might have been at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> before
they could have been half Way to him. But
Heaven, when the Ruine of a Per&s;on or Party is
determined, always &s;o infatuates their Coun&s;els,
as to make them in&s;trumental to it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The King let &s;lip this great Opportunity, as
&s;ome thought, intending to break into the
A&s;&s;ociated Counties, of <HI>Northampton, Cambridge,
Norfolk,</HI> where he had &s;ome Intere&s;ts forming.
What the De&s;ign was, we knew not, but the
King turns Ea&s;tward, and Marches into <HI>Leice&s;ter|&s;hire,</HI>
and having treated the Country but very
indifferently, as having de&s;erved no better of us,
laid Siege to <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>This was but a &s;hort Siege; for the King, re|&s;olving
not to lo&s;e Time, fell on with his great
Guns, and having beaten down their Works,
our Foot entered, after a vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance,
and took the Town by Storm. There was &s;ome
Blood &s;hed here, the Town being carried
by A&s;&s;ault; but it was their own Faults; for after
the Town was taken, the Soldiers and Town&s;|men
ob&s;tinately fought us in the Market-Place;
in&s;omuch that the Hor&s;e was called to enter
<PB N="291" REF="297">
the Town to clear the Streets. But this was
not all; I was commanded to advance with the&s;e
Hor&s;e, being three Regiments, and to enter the
Town; the Foot, who were engaged in the
Streets, crying out, <HI>Hor&s;e, Hor&s;e.</HI> Immediately
I advanced to the Gate, for we were drawn up
about Mu&s;quet Shot from the Works, to have
&s;upported our Foot, in Ca&s;e of a Sally. Having
&s;iezed the Gate, I placed a Guard of Hor&s;e
there, with Orders to let no Body pa&s;s in or
out, and dividing my Troops, rode up by two
Ways towards the Market-Place; the Garri&s;on
defending them&s;elves in the Market-Place, and
in the Church-yard with great Ob&s;tinancy,
killed us a great many Men; but, as &s;oon as our
Hor&s;e appeared, they demanded Quarter, which
our Foot refu&s;ed them in the fir&s;t Heat, as is
frequent in all Nations, in like Ca&s;es; 'till at
la&s;t, they threw down their Arms, and yielded
at Di&s;cretion; and then I can te&s;ti&s;y to the
World, that fair Quarter was given them.
I am the more particular in this Relation, ha|ving
been an Eye-witne&s;s of the Action, becau&s;e
the King was reproached in all the publick Li|bels,
with which tho&s;e Times abounded, for
having put a great many to Death, and hanged
the Committee of the Parliament, and &s;ome
<HI>Scots,</HI> in cold Blood, which was a notorious For|gery;
and as I am &s;ure there was no &s;uch thing done,
&s;o I mu&s;t acknowledge I never &s;aw any Inclination
in his Maje&s;ty to Cruelty, or to act any thing
which was not practi&s;ed by the General Laws of
War, and by Men of Honour in all Nations.</P>
<P>But the Matter of Fact, in Re&s;pect to the Gar|ri&s;on,
was as I have related; and, if they had
thrown down their Arms &s;ooner, they had had
Mercy &s;ooner; but it was not for a conquering
<PB N="292" REF="298">
Army, entered a Town by Storm, to offer Con|ditions
of Quarter in the Streets.</P>
<P>Another Circum&s;tance was, that a great ma|ny
of the Inhabitants, both Men and Women,
were killed, which is mo&s;t true; and the Ca&s;e
was thus: The Inhabitants, to &s;hew their over|forward
Zeal to defend the Town, fought in
the Breach; nay, the very Women, to the Ho|nour
of the <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> Ladies, if they like it, of|ficiou&s;ly
did their Parts; and after the Town was
taken, and when, if they had had any Brains in
their Zeal, they would have kept their Hou&s;es,
and been quiet, they fired upon our Men out
of their Windows, and from the Tops of their
Hou&s;es, and threw Tiles upon their Heads; and
I had &s;everal of my Men wounded &s;o, and 7
or 8 killed. This exa&s;perated us to the la&s;t
Degree; and, finding one Hou&s;e better manned
than ordinary, and many &s;hot fired at us out
of the Windows, I cau&s;ed my Men to attack it,
re&s;olved to make them an Example for the re&s;t;
which they did, and breaking open the Doors,
they killed all they found there, without Di|&s;tinction;
and I appeal to the World if they were
to blame. If the Parliament Committee, or the
<HI>Scots</HI> Deputies were here, they ought to have
been quiet, &s;ince the Town was taken; but they
began with us, and, I think, brought it upon
them&s;elves. This is the whole Ca&s;e, &s;o far as
came within my Knowledge, for which his Ma|je&s;ty
was &s;o much abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>We took here Collonel <HI>Gray</HI> and Captain
<HI>Hacker,</HI> and about 300 Pri&s;oners, and about 300
more were killed. This was the la&s;t Day of
<HI>May</HI> 16415.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having given over <HI>Oxford</HI> for lo&s;t,
continued here &s;ome Days, viewed the Town,
<PB N="293" REF="299">
ordered the Fortifications to be augmented, and
prepares to make it the Seat of War. But the
Parliament, rouzed at this Appearance of the
King's Army, order their General to rai&s;e the
Siege of <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the Garri&s;on had, in a
Sally, ruined &s;ome of their Works, and killed
them 150 Men, taking &s;everal Pri&s;oners, and
carrying them with them into the City; and
orders him to march towards <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> to ob&s;erve
the King.</P>
<P>The King had now a &s;mall, but gallant Ar|my,
all brave tried Soldiers, and &s;eemed eager
to engage the new-modelled Army; and his Ma|je&s;ty,
hearing that Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> having rai|&s;ed
the Siege of <HI>Oxford,</HI> advanced towards him,
fairly &s;aves him the Trouble of a long March,
and meets him half Way.</P>
<P>The Army lay at <HI>Daventry,</HI> and <HI>Fairfax</HI> at
<HI>Towce&s;ter,</HI> about 8 Miles off. Here the King &s;ends
away 600 Hor&s;e, with 3000 Head of Cattle, to
relieve his People in <HI>Oxford;</HI> the Cattle he
might have &s;pared better than the Men. The
King having thus victualled <HI>Oxford,</HI> changes his
Re&s;olution of fighting <HI>Fairfax,</HI> to whom <HI>Crom|well</HI>
was now joined with 4000 Men, or was with|in
a Day's March, and marches Northward.
This was unhappy Coun&s;el, becau&s;e late given:
Had we marched Northward at fir&s;t, we had
done it; but thus it was. Now we marched
with a triumphing Enemy at our Heels, and at
<HI>Na&s;eby</HI> their advanced Parties attacked our Rear.
The King, upon this, alters his Re&s;olution again,
and re&s;olves to fight, and at Midnight calls us up at
<HI>Harborough</HI> to come to a Council of War. Fate
and the King's Opinion determined the Council
of War; and 'twas re&s;olved to fight. Accor|dingly
the Van, in which was Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Bri|gade
<PB N="294" REF="300">
of Hor&s;e, of which my Regiment was a
Part, countermarched early in the Morning.</P>
<P>By five a Clock in the Morning, the whole
Army, in Order of Battle, began to de&s;cry the
Enemy from the ri&s;ing Grounds, about a Mile
from <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> and moved towards them. They
were drawn up on a little A&s;cent in a large
Common Fallow Field, in one Line extended
from one Side of the Field to the other, the
Field &s;omething more than a Mile over, our
Army in the &s;ame Order, in one Line, with the
Re&s;erves.</P>
<P>The King led the main Battle of Foot, Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> the Right Wing of the Hor&s;e, and Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> the Left. Of the Enemy
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Skippon</HI> led the Body, <HI>Cr$mwell</HI> and
<HI>Ro&s;eter</HI> the Right, and <HI>Ireton</HI> the Left. The
Numbers of both Armies &s;o equal, as not to
differ 500 Men, &s;ave that the King had mo&s;t
Hore by about 1000, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> mo&s;t Foot
by about 500. The Number was in each Army
about 18000 Men.</P>
<P>The Armies coming clo&s;e up, the Wings
engaged fir&s;t. The Prince with his Right Wing
charged with his wanted Fury, and drove all
the Parliament's Wing of Hor&s;e, one Divi&s;ion
excepted, clear out of the Field. <HI>Ireton,</HI> who
commanded this Wing, give him his due, ral|lied
often, and fought like a Lion; but our
Wing bore down all before them, and pur&s;ued
them with a terrible Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Ireton</HI> &s;eeing one Divi&s;ion of his Hor&s;e left,
repaired to them, and keeping his Ground,
fell foul of a Brigade of our Foot, who coming
up to the Head of the Line, he like mad Man
charges them with his Hor&s;e: But they with
their Pikes tore him to Pieces; &s;o that this
<PB N="295" REF="301">
Divi&s;ion was entirely ruined. <HI>Ireton</HI> him&s;elf
thru&s;t through the Thigh with a Pike, wound|ed
in the Face with a Halberd, was unhor&s;ed
and taken Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><HI>Cromwell,</HI> who commanded the Parliament's
Right Wing, charged Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI>
with extraordinary Fury; but he an old tried
Soldier, &s;tood firm, and received the Charge
with equal Gallantry, exchanging all their Shot,
Carabines and Pi&s;tols, and then fell on Sword in
Hand. Ro&s;eter and Whaley had the better on
the Point of the Wing, and routed two Divi&s;i|ons
of Hor&s;e, pu&s;hing them behind the Re&s;erves,
where they rallied, and charged again, but
were at la&s;t defeated; the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e
now charged in the Flank retreated fighting,
and were pu&s;hed behind the Re&s;erves of Foot.</P>
<P>While this was doing, the Foot engaged
with equal Feircene&s;s, and for two Hours there
was a terrible Fire. The King's Foot backed
with gallant Officers, and full of Rage at the
Rout of their Hor&s;e, bore down the Enemy's
Brigade led by <HI>Skippon.</HI> The old Man woun|ded,
bleeding retreats to their Re&s;erves. All the
Foot, except the General's Brigade, were thus
driven into the Re&s;erves, where their Officers
rallied them, and bring them on to a fre&s;h
Charge; and here the Hor&s;e having driven our
Hor&s;e about a Quarter of a Mile from the Foot,
face about, and fall in on the Rear of the
Foot.</P>
<P>Had our Right Wing done thus, the Day had
been &s;ecured; but Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> according to
his Cu&s;tom, following the flying Enemy, never
concerned him&s;elf with the Safety of tho&s;e
behind; and yet he returned &s;ooner than he
had done in like Ca&s;es too. At our Return we
<PB N="295" REF="302">
found all in Confu&s;ion, our Foot broken, all
but one Brigade, which though charged in
Front, Flank and Rear, could not be broken,
till Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> him&s;elf came up to the
Charge with fre&s;h Men, and then they were
rather cut in Pieces then beaten; for they
&s;tood with their $ikes charged every Way to
the la&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>In this Condition, at the Di&s;tance of a Quar|ter
of a Mile, we &s;aw the King rallying his
Hor&s;e, and preparing to renew the Fight; and
our Wing of Hor&s;e coming up to him, gave
him Opportunity to draw up a large Body of
Hor&s;e, &s;o large, that all the Enemy's Hor&s;e
facing us, &s;tood &s;till and looked on, but did
not think fit to charge us, till their Foot, who
had entirely broken our main Battle, were put
into Order again, and brought up to us.</P>
<P>The Officers about the King advi&s;ed his
Maje&s;ty rather to draw off; for, &s;ince our Foot
were lo&s;t, it would be too much Odds to expo&s;e
the Hor&s;e to the Fury of their whole Army,
and would but be &s;acrificing his be&s;t Troops,
without and Hopes of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The King, though with great Regret, at the
Lo&s;s of his Foot, yet &s;eeing there was no other
Hope, took this advice, and retreated in good
Order to <HI>Harborough,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Occa&s;ion of the Enemy having
&s;o great a Number of Pri&s;oners; for the Hor&s;e
being thus gone off, the Foot had no Means to
make their Retreat, and were obliged to yield
them&s;elves. Commi&s;&s;ary General <HI>Ireton</HI> being
taken by a Captain of Foot, makes the Captain
his Pri&s;oner, to &s;ave his Life, and gives him his
Liberty for his Courte&s;y before.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="303">
<HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;eter,</HI> with all the Enemy's
Hor&s;e, followed us as far as <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and killed
all that they could lay hold on &s;traggling from
the Body, but dur&s;t not attempt to charge
us in a Body. The King expecting the Enemy
would come to <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> removes to <HI>A&s;hby de la
Zouch,</HI> where we had &s;ome Time to recollect
our &s;elves.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t fatal Action of the whole
War; not &s;o much for the Lo&s;s of our Cannon,
Ammunition, and Baggage, of which the Enemy
boa&s;ted &s;o much, but as it was impo&s;&s;ible for
the King ever to retrieve it: The Foot, the
be&s;t that ever he was Ma&s;ter of, could never be
&s;upplied; his Army in the We&s;t was expo&s;ed
to certain Ruin, the North over-run with the
<HI>Scots; in &s;hort,</HI> the Ca&s;e grew de&s;perate, and the
King was once upon the Point of bidding us all
disband, and &s;hift for our &s;elves.</P>
<P>We lo&s;t in this Fight not above 2000 &s;lain,
and the Parliament near as many, but the
Pri&s;oners were a great Number; the whole Body
of Foot being, as I have &s;aid, di&s;per&s;ed, there
were 4500 Pri&s;oners, be&s;ides 400 Officers, 2000
Hor&s;es, 12 Pieces of Cannon, 40 Barrels of Pow|der,
all the King's Baggage, Coaches, mo&s;t of
his Servants, and his Secretary, with his Ca|binet
of Letters, of which the Parliament made
great Improvement, and, ba&s;ely enough cau&s;ed
his private Letters between his Maje&s;ty and the
Queen, her Maje&s;ty's Letters to the King, and a
great deal of &s;uch Stuff to be printed.</P>
<P>After this fatal Blow, being retreated, as I
have &s;aid, to <HI>A&s;hby de la Zouch</HI> in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI>
the King ordered us to divide; his Maje&s;ty,
with a Body of Hor&s;e, about 3000, went to
<HI>Litchfield,</HI> and through <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> into North <HI>Wales</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="304">
and Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> with about 2500
went to <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>The King remained in <HI>Wales</HI> for &s;everal
Months; and though the Length of the War
had almo&s;t drained that Country of Men, yet
the King rai&s;ed a great many Men there, re|cruited
his Hor&s;e Regiments, and got together
&s;ix or &s;even Regiments of Foot, which &s;eemed
to look like the Beginning of a New Army.</P>
<P>I had frequent Di&s;cour&s;es with his Maje&s;ty
in this low Ebb of his Affairs, and he would
often wi&s;h he had not expo&s;ed his Army at
<HI>Na&s;eby.</HI> I took the Freedom once to make a
Propo&s;ition to his Maje&s;ty, which if it had
taken Effect, I verily believe would have given
a new Turn to his Affairs; and that was, at
once to flight all his Garri&s;ons in the Kingdom,
and give private Orders to all the Soldiers in
every Place, to join in Bodies, and meet at two
General Rendezvous, which I would have ap|pointed
to be, one at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and one at <HI>We&s;t|che&s;ter.</HI>
I demon&s;trated how ea&s;ily all the Forces
might reach the&s;e two Places; and both being
&s;trong and wealthy Places, and both Sea-Ports,
he would have a free Communication by Sea,
with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and with his Friends abroad; and
having <HI>Wales</HI> entirely his own, he might yet
have an Opportunity to make good Terms for
him&s;elf, or el&s;e have another fair Field with
the Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon a fair Calculation of his Troops in
&s;everal Garri&s;ons and &s;mall Bodies di&s;per&s;ed
about, I convinced the King, by his own Ac|counts,
that he might have two compleat Ar|mies,
each of 25000 Foot, 8000 Hor&s;e, and 2000
Dragoons; that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> and the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> might Ship all their Forces, and come
<PB N="299" REF="305">
by Sea in two Tides, and be with him in a
&s;horter Time than the Enemy could follow.</P>
<P>With two &s;uch Bodies he might face the
Enemy, and make a Day of it; but now his Men
were only &s;acrificed, and eaten up by Piece-meal
in a Party-War, and &s;pent their Lives and
E&s;tates to do him no Service: That if the Par|liament
garri&s;oned the Towns and Ca&s;tles he
&s;hould quit, they would le&s;&s;en their Army,
and not dare to &s;ee him in the Field; and if
they did not, but left them open, then 'twould
be no Lo&s;s to him, but he might p&s;&s;e&s;s them
as often as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This Advice I pre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch Arguments,
that the King was once going to di&s;patch Orders
for the doing it; but to be irre&s;olute in Coun&s;el,
is always the Companion of a declining Fortune;
the King was doubtful, and could not re&s;olve
till it was too late.</P>
<P>And yet, though the King's Forces were
very low, his Maje&s;ty was re&s;olved to make
one Adventure more, and it was a &s;trange one;
for, with but a Handful of Men he made a de|&s;perate
March, almo&s;t 250 Miles in the Middle
of the whole Kingdom, compa&s;&s;ed about with
Armies and Parties innumerable, traver&s;ed the
Heart of his Enemy's Country, entered their
a&s;&s;ociated Counties, where no Army had ever
yet come, and in &s;pight of all their victorious
Troops facing and following him, alarmed even
<HI>London</HI> it &s;elf, and returned &s;afe to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty continued in <HI>Wales</HI> from the
Battle at <HI>Na&s;eby</HI> till the 5th or 6th <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and
till he had an Account from all parts of the
Progre&s;s of his Enemies, and the Po&s;ture of his
own Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="306">
Here he found, that the Enemy being hard
pre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> by the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> and
Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s Forces, who had take <HI>Bridgewater,</HI>
and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Taunton,</HI> which was now at the
Point of Surrender, they had ordered <HI>Fairfax</HI>
and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the whole Army to march
We&s;tward, to relieve the Town; which they
did, and <HI>Goring</HI>'s Troops were wor&s;ted, and him|&s;elf
wounded at the Fight at <HI>Langport.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> who were always the dead Weight
upon the King's Affairs, having no more Work
to do in the North, were, at the Parliament's
De&s;ire, advanced Southward, and then ordered
away towards South <HI>Wales,</HI> and were &s;et down
to the Siege of <HI>Hereford.</HI> Here this famous <HI>Scotch</HI>
Army &s;pent &s;everal Months in a fruitle&s;s Siege,
ill provided of Ammunition, and wor&s;e with
Money; and having &s;at near three Months be|fore
the Town, and done little but eaten up the
Country round them; upon the repeated Ac|counts
of the Progre&s;s of the Marque&s;s of <HI>Mon|tro&s;e</HI>
in that Kingdom, and pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances
of their Countrymen, they re&s;olved to rai&s;e their
Siege, and go home to relieve their Friends.</P>
<P>The King, who was willing to be rid of the
<HI>Scots,</HI> upon good Terms; and therefore to ha&s;ten
them, and lea&s;t they &s;hould pretend to pu&s;h
on the Siege to take the Town fir&s;t, gives it
out, that he was re&s;olved with all his Forces
to go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and join <HI>Montro&s;e;</HI> and &s;o
having &s;ecured <HI>Scotland,</HI> to renew the War from
thence.</P>
<P>And accordingly his Maje&s;ty marches North|wards,
with a Body of 4000 Hor&s;e; and, had
the King really done this, and with that Body
of Hor&s;e marched away, (for he had the Start
of all his Enemies, by above a Fortnight's March)
<PB N="301" REF="307">
he had then had the faire&s;t Opportunity for
a general Turn of all his Affairs, that he ever
had in all the latter Part of this War: For
<HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> a gallant daring Soldier, who from
the lea&s;t Shadow of Force in the farthe&s;t Cor|ner
of his Country, had, rowling like a Snow
Ball, &s;pread all over <HI>Scotland,</HI> was come into the
South Parts, and had &s;ummoned <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
frighted away their, State&s;men, beaten their
Soldiers at <HI>Dundee</HI> and other Places, and Letters
and Me&s;&s;engers in the Heels of one another,
repeated their Cries to their Brethren in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
to lay before them the &s;ad Condition of
the Country, and to ha&s;ten the Army to their
Relief. The <HI>Scots</HI> Lords of the Enemy's Party
fled to <HI>Berwick,</HI> and the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI>
goes him&s;elf to General <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> to pre&s;s him
for help.</P>
<P>In this Extremity of Affairs <HI>Scotland</HI> lay, when
we marched out of <HI>Wales.</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> at the Siege
of <HI>Hereford</HI> hearing the King was gone North|ward
with his Hor&s;e, conclude he was gone
directly for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and immediately &s;end
<HI>Le&s;ly</HI> with 4000 Hor&s;e and Foot to follow, but
did not yet rai&s;e the Siege.</P>
<P>But the King &s;till irre&s;olute, turns away to the
Ea&s;tward, and comes to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> where he
&s;hewed his Re&s;entments at Collonel <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> for
his ea&s;y Surrender of <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>In this March the Enemy took Heart; we
had Troops of Hor&s;e on every Side upon us,
like Hounds &s;tarted at a fre&s;h Stag. <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> with
the <HI>Scots,</HI> and a &s;trong Body followed in our
Rear, Major General <HI>Points,</HI> Sir <HI>John Gell,</HI> Collonel
<HI>Ro&s;eter,</HI> and others, in our Way; they pretended
to be 10000 Hor&s;e, and yet never dur&s;t face us.
The <HI>Scots</HI> made one Attempt upon a Troop which
<PB N="302" REF="308">
&s;tayed a little behind, and took &s;ome Pri&s;oners;
but when a Regiment of our Hor&s;e faced
them, they retired. At a Village near <HI>Litchfield,</HI>
another Party of about 1000 Hor&s;e attacked my
Regiment; we were on the left of the Army,
and, at a little too far a Di&s;tance. I happened to
be with the King at that time, and my Lieu|tenant
Collonel with me; &s;o that the Major had
Charge of the Regiment; he made a very hand|&s;ome
Defence, but &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers for &s;peedy
Relief; we were on a March, and therefore all
ready, and the King orders me a Regiment of
Dragoons and 300 Hor&s;e, and the Body halted
to bring us off, not knowing how &s;trong the
Enemy might be. When I came to the Place
I found my Major hard layed to, but fighting
like a Lion; the Enemy had broke in upon him
in two Places, and had routed one Troop,
cutting them off from the Body, and had made
them all Pri&s;oners. Upon this I fell in with the
300 Hor&s;e, and cleared my Major from a Party
who charged him in the Flank; the Dragoons
immediately lighting, one Party of them comes up
on my Wing, and &s;aluting the Enemy with
their Mu&s;quets, put them to a &s;tand; the other
Party of Dragoons wheeling to the Left, en|deavoured
to get behind them. The Enemy
perceiving they &s;hould be over-powered, retrea|ted
in as good Order as they could, but left
us mo&s;t of our Pri&s;oners, and about 30 of their
own. We lo&s;t about 15 of our Men, and the
Enemy about 40, chiefly by the Fire of our Dra|goons
in their Retreat.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture we continued our March; and
though the King halted at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> which was
a dangerous Article, having &s;o many of the E|nemy's
Troops upon his Hands, and this Time
<PB N="303" REF="309">
gave them Opportunity to get into a Body;
yet the <HI>Scots,</HI> with their General <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> re&s;olving
for the North, the re&s;t of the Troops were not
able to face us, till having ravaged the Enemy's
Country through <HI>Stafford&s;hire, Warwick, Leice&s;ter,</HI>
and <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> we came to the Leaguer be|fore
<HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>The King was once more on the Mind to have
gone into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and called a Council of War
to that Purpo&s;e; but then it was re&s;olved by
all Hands, that it would be too late to attempt
it; for the <HI>Scots</HI> and Major General <HI>Pointz</HI> were
before us, and &s;everal &s;trong Bodies of Hor&s;e in
our Rear; and there was no venturing now, un|le&s;s
any Advantage pre&s;ented to rout one of
tho&s;e Parties which attended us.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e and like Con&s;iderations we re&s;ol|ved
for <HI>Newark;</HI> on our Approach the Forces
which blocked up that Town drew off, being
too weak to oppo&s;e us; for the King was now
above 5000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, be&s;ides 300
Hor&s;e and Dragoons he took with him from
<HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>We halted at <HI>Newark</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Garri&s;on, or
give them Time rather to furni&s;h them&s;elves
from the Country with what they wanted, which
they were very diligent in doing; for in two
Days time they filled a large I&s;land which lies
under the Town, between the two Branches of
the <HI>Trent,</HI> with Sheep, Oxen, Cows and Hor&s;es,
an incredible Number; and our Affairs being
now &s;omething de&s;perate, we were not very nice
in our U&s;age of the Country; for really if it
was not with a Re&s;olution, both to puni&s;h the
Enemy and enrich our &s;elves, no Man can give
any rational Account why this de&s;perate Jour|ney
was undertaken.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="310">
'Tis certain the <HI>Newarkers,</HI> in the Re&s;pite they
gained by our coming, got above 50000l. from
the Country round them, in Corn, Cattle, Mo|ney,
and other Plunder.</P>
<P>From hence we broke into <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and
the King lay at <HI>Belvoir</HI> Ca&s;tle, and from <HI>Belvoir</HI>
Ca&s;tle to <HI>Stamford.</HI> The Swiftne&s;s of our March
was a terrible Surprize to the Enemy; for our
Van being at a Village on the great Road called
<HI>Stilton,</HI> the Country People fled into the I&s;le of
<HI>Ely,</HI> and every Way, as if all was lo&s;t. Indeed
our Dragoons treated the Country very coar&s;ly;
and all our Men in general made them&s;elves rich.
Between <HI>Stilton</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon</HI> we had a &s;mall
Bu&s;tle with &s;ome of the A&s;&s;ociation Troops of
Hor&s;e, but they were &s;oon routed, and fled to
<HI>Huntingdon,</HI> where they gave &s;uch an Account
of us to their Fellows, that they did not think
fit to &s;tay for us, but left their Foot to defend
them&s;elves as well as they could.</P>
<P>While this was doing in the Van, a Party
from <HI>Burleigh</HI> Hou&s;e, near <HI>Stamford,</HI> the Seat of
the Earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> pur&s;ued four Troops of our
Hor&s;e, who &s;traggling towards <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and
committing &s;ome Di&s;orders there, were &s;urpri|zed
before they could get into a Po&s;ture of
Fighting; and encumbered, as I &s;uppo&s;e, with
their Plunder, they were entirely routed, lo&s;t
mo&s;t of their Hor&s;es, and were forced to come
away on Foot; but finding them&s;elves in this
Condition, they got into a Body in the Enclo|&s;ures,
and in that Po&s;ture turning Dragoons, they
lined the Hedges, and fired upon the Enemy
with their Carabines. This way of Fighting,
though not very plea&s;ant to Troopers, put the
Enemy's Hor&s;e to &s;ome Stand, and encouraged
our Men to venture into a Village, where the
<PB N="305" REF="311">
Enemy had &s;ecured 40 of their Hor&s;e; and
boldly charging the Guard, they beat them off
and recovered tho&s;e Hor&s;es; the re&s;t made their
Retreat good to <HI>Wandsford</HI> Bridge; but we lo&s;t
near 100 Hor&s;es, and about 12 of our Men taken
Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The next Day the King took <HI>Huntington;</HI> the
Foot which were left in the Town, as I ob&s;erved
by their Hor&s;e, had po&s;ted them&s;elves at the
Foot of the Bridge, and fortified the Pa&s;s, with
&s;uch Things as the Ha&s;te and Shortne&s;s of the
Time would allow; and in this Po&s;ture they
&s;eemed re&s;olute to defend them&s;elves. I con|fe&s;s,
had they in Time planted a good Force
here, they might have put a full Stop to our
little Army; for the River is large and deep,
the Country on the left mar&s;hy, full of Drains
and Ditches, and unfit for Hor&s;e, and we mu&s;t
have either turned back, or took the Right
Hand into <HI>Bedford&s;hire;</HI> but here not being above
400 Foot, and they for&s;aken of their Hor&s;e,
the Re&s;u&s;tance they made was to no other Pur|po&s;e
than to give us Occa&s;ion to knock them in
the Head, and plunder the Town.</P>
<P>However they defended the Bridge, as I
have &s;aid, and oppo&s;ed our Pa&s;&s;age. I was this
Day in the Van, and our Forelorn having en|tered
<HI>Huntington</HI> without any great Re&s;i&s;tance
till they came to the Bridge, finding it barrica|ded,
they &s;ent me Word; I cau&s;ed the Troops
to halt, and rid up to the Forelorn, to view
the Countenance of the Enemy, and found by
the Po&s;ture they had put them&s;elves in, that
they re&s;olved to &s;ell us the Pa&s;&s;age as de$$' as
they could.</P>
<P>I &s;ent to the King for &s;ome Dragoons, and gave
him Account of what I ob&s;erved of the Enemy, and
<PB N="306" REF="312">
that I judged them to be 1000 Men; for I could
not particularly &s;ee their Numbers. According|ly
the King ordered 500 Dragoons to attack
the Bridge, commanded by a Major; the Ene|my
had 200 Mu&s;queteers placed on the Bridge,
their Barricade &s;erved them for a Brea&s;t-work
on the Front, and the low Walls on the Bridge
&s;erved to &s;ecure their Flanks: Two Bodies of
their Foot were placed on the oppo&s;ite Banks of
the River, and a Re&s;erve &s;tood in the High-way
on the Rear. The Number of their Men could
not have been better ordered, and they wanted
not Courage an&s;werable to the Conduct of the
Party. They were commanded by one <HI>Bennet,</HI>
a re&s;olute Officer, who &s;tood in the Front of his
Men on the Bridge with a Pike in his Hand.</P>
<P>Before we began to fall on, the King ordered
to view the River, to &s;ee if it was no where pa&s;&s;a|ble,
or any Boat to be had; but the River
being not fordable, and the Boats all &s;ecured
on the other Side, the Attack was re&s;olved on,
and the Dragoons fell on with extraordinary
Bravery. The Foot defended them&s;elves ob|&s;tinately,
and beat off our Dragoons twice; and
though <HI>Bonnet</HI> was killed upon the Spot, and
after him him his Lieutenant, yet their Officers
relieving them with fre&s;h Men, they would cer|tainly
have beat us all off, had not a venturous
Fellow, one of our Dragoons thrown him&s;elf
into the River, &s;wum over, and, in the mid&s;t
of a Shower of Mu&s;quet Bullets, cut the Rope
which tied a great flat-bottom Boat, and brought
her over: With the Help of this Boat, I got
over 100 Troopers fir&s;t, and then their Hor&s;es,
and then 200 more without their Hor&s;es; and
with this Party fell in with one of the &s;mall
Bodies of Foot that were po&s;ted on that Side,
<PB N="307" REF="313">
and having routed them, and after them the
Re&s;erve which &s;tood in the Road, I made up &s;o
the other Party; they &s;tood their Ground, and
having rallied the Run-aways of both the other
Parties, charged me with their Pikes, and
brought me to a Retreat; but by this time the
King had &s;ent over 300 Men more, and they
coming up to me, the Foot retreated. Tho&s;e
on the Bridge finding how 'twas and having no
Supplies &s;ent them, as before, fainted, and fled;
and the Dragoons ru&s;hing forward, mo&s;t of them
were killed; about 150 of the Enemy were
killed, of which all the Officers at the Bridge,
the re&s;t run away.</P>
<P>The Town &s;uffered for it; for our Men left
them little of any thing they could carry. Here
we halted, and rai&s;ed Contributions, took Money
of the Country, and of the open Towns, to ex|empt
them from Plunder. Twice we faced the
Town of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and &s;everal of our Officers
advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to &s;torm it; but having no
Foot, and but 1200 Dragoons, wi&s;er Heads di|verted
him from it; and, leaving <HI>Cambridge</HI> on
the left, we marched to <HI>Wooburn,</HI> in <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI>
and our Parties rai&s;ed Money all over the Coun|ty
quite into <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> within 5 Miles of
St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Swiftne&s;s of our March, and Uncertainty
which Way we intended, prevented all po&s;&s;i|ble
Preparation to oppo&s;e us, and we met with
no Party able to make Head again&s;t us. From
<HI>Wooburn</HI> the King went through <HI>Buckingham</HI> to
<HI>Oxford;</HI> &s;ome of our Men &s;traggling in the Villa|ges
for Plunder, were often picked up by the
Enemy; but in all this long March we did not
loo&s;e 200 Men, got an incredible Booty, and
<PB N="308" REF="314">
brought 6 Waggons loaden with Money, be&s;ides
2000 Hor&s;es, and 3000 Head of Cattle into
<HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Oxford</HI> his Maje&s;ty moves again into
<HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> having left about 1500 of his Hor&s;e
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to &s;cour the Country, and rai&s;e Con|tributions,
which they did as far as <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> was returned from taking
<HI>Bridgewater,</HI> and was &s;at down before <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
in which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> commanded with a &s;trong
Garri&s;on, 2500 Foot and 1000 Hor&s;e. We had
not Force enough to attempt any thing there;
but the <HI>Scots,</HI> who lay &s;till before <HI>Hereford,</HI> were
afraid of us, having before parted with all their
Hor&s;e under Lieutenant General <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> and but
ill &s;tored with Provi&s;ions; and, if we came on
their Backs, were in a fair way to be &s;tarved,
or made to buy their Provi&s;ions at the Price of
their Blood.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was &s;en&s;ible of this, and had we
had but 10 Regiments of Foot, would certainly
have fought the <HI>Scots;</HI> but we had no Foot, or &s;o
few as was not worth while to march them.
However, the King marched to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and
the <HI>Scots</HI> apprehending they &s;hould be blocked
up, immediately rai&s;ed the Siege, pretending
it was to go help their Brethren in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
away they marched Northwards.</P>
<P>We picked up &s;ome of their Stragglers, but
they were &s;o poor, had been &s;o ill paid, and &s;o
harra&s;&s;ed at the Siege, that they had neither
Money nor Clothes; and the poor Soldiers fed
upon Apples and Roots, and eat the very green
Corn as it grew in the Fields, which reduced
them to a very &s;orry Condition of Health, for
they died like People infected with the Plague.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="315">
'Twas now debated whether we &s;hould yet
march for <HI>Scotland,</HI> but two Things prevented.
1. The Plague was broke out there, and Mul|titudes
died of it, which made the King back|ward,
and the Men more backward. 2. The
Marque&s;s of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> having routed a whole
Brigade of <HI>Le&s;ly</HI>'s be&s;t Hor&s;e, and carried all
before him, wrote to his Maje&s;ty, that he did
not now want A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but was in Hopes in a
few Days to &s;end a Body of Foot into <HI>England,</HI>
to his Maje&s;ty's A&s;&s;i&s;tance. This over Confi|dence
of his was his Ruine; for, on the con|trary,
had he earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed the King to have
marched, and fallen in with his Hor&s;e, the King
had done it, and been ab&s;olutely Ma&s;ter of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
in a Fortnight's time; but <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> was too
confident, and defied them all, till at la&s;t they
got their Forces together, and <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> with his
Hor&s;e out of <HI>England,</HI> and wor&s;ted him in two
or three Encounters, and then never left him
till they drove him out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>While his Maje&s;ty &s;tayed at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> &s;everal
Me&s;&s;engers came to him from <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> for Relief,
being exceedingly &s;treightened by the Forces of
the Parliament: In order to which, the King
marched, but <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> being in the Enemy's
Hands, he was obliged to go round by <HI>Ludlow,</HI>
where he was joined by &s;ome Foot out of <HI>Wales.</HI>
I took this Opportunity to ask his Maje&s;ty's
Leave to go by <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> to my Father's, and
taking only two Servants, I left the Army two
Days before they marched.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t Un&s;oldier-like Action that
ever I was guilty of, to go out of the Army to pay
a Vi&s;it, when a Time of Action was ju&s;t at Hand;
and, though I prote&s;t I had not the lea&s;t Intima|tion,
no not fri$m my own Thoughts, that the
<PB N="310" REF="316">
Army would engage, at lea&s;t before they came
to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> before which I intended to meet them;
yet it looked &s;o ill, &s;o like an Excu&s;e, or a Sham
of Cowardi&s;e, or Di&s;affection to the Cau&s;e, and
to my Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t, or &s;omething I know
not what, that I could not bear to think of it,
nor never had the Heart to &s;ee the King's Face
after it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ludlow</HI> the King marched to relieve
<HI>Che&s;ter; Poyatz,</HI> who commanded the Parliament's
Forces, follows the King, with De&s;ign to join
with the Forces before <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> under Collonel
<HI>Jones,</HI> before the King could come up. To that
End <HI>Poyntz,</HI> pa&s;&s;es through <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> the Day
that the King marched from <HI>Ludlow;</HI> yet the
King's Forces got the Start of him, and forced
him to engage: Had the King engaged him
but three Hours &s;ooner, and con&s;equently far|ther
off from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> he had ruined him; for
<HI>Poyntz</HI>'s Men not able to &s;tand the Shock of
the King's Hor&s;e, gave Ground, and would in
half an Hour more been beaten out of the Field;
but Collonel <HI>Jones,</HI> with a &s;trong Party from
the Camp, which was within two Miles, comes
up in the Heat of the Action, falls on in the
King's Rear, and turned the Scale of the Day:
The Body was, after an ob&s;tinate Fight defeated,
and a great many Gentlemen of Quality killed
and taken Pri&s;oners; the Earl of <HI>Litchfield</HI> was
of the Number of the former, and 67 Officers
of the latter, with 1000 others.</P>
<P>The King with about 500 Hor&s;e got into
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Wales,</HI> whither all
that could get away made up to him as fa&s;t as
they could, but in a bad Condition.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t Stroke they &s;truck, the re&s;t
of the War was nothing but taking all his Gar|ri&s;ons
<PB N="311" REF="317">
from him, one by one, till they fini&s;hed
the War, with the captivating his Per&s;on, and
then, for want of other Bu&s;ine&s;s, fell to fighting
with one another.</P>
<P>I was quite di&s;con&s;olate at the News of this
la&s;t Action, and the more becau&s;e I was not
there; my Regiment was wholly di&s;per&s;ed, my
Lieutenant Collonel, a Gentleman of a good
Family, and a near Relation to my Mother, was
Pri&s;oner, my Major and three Captains killed, and
mo&s;t of the re&s;t Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The King, hopele&s;s of any con&s;iderable Party
in <HI>Wales, Bri&s;tol</HI> being &s;urrendered, &s;ends for
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> who came
to him. With them, and the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and a great Train of Gen|tlemen,
his Maje&s;ty marches to <HI>Newark</HI> again,
leaves a Thou&s;and Hor&s;e with Sir <HI>William Vaughan,</HI>
to attempt the Relief of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> in doing
whereof he was routed the &s;econd time by <HI>Jones</HI>
and his Men, and entirely di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>The chief Strength the King had in the&s;e
Parts was at <HI>Newark,</HI> and the Parliament were
very earne&s;t with the <HI>Scots</HI> to march Southward,
and to lay Siege to <HI>Newark;</HI> and while the Par|liament
pre&s;&s;ed them to it, and they &s;at &s;till,
and delayed it, &s;everal Heats began, and &s;ome
ill blood between them, which after wards broke
out into open War. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reproached the
<HI>Scots</HI> with pretending to help them, and really
hindering their Affairs. The <HI>Scots</HI> returned,
that they come to fight for them, and are left
to be &s;tarved, and can neither get Money nor
Clothes. At la&s;t they came to this, the
<HI>Scots</HI> will come to the Siege, if the Parlia|ment
will &s;end them Money, but not before:
However, as People &s;ooner agree in doing ill,
<PB N="312" REF="318">
than in doing well, they came to Terms, and
the <HI>Scots</HI> came with their whole Army to
the Siege of <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>The King, fore&s;eeing the Siege, calls his
Fiends about him, tells them, he &s;ees his Cir|cum&s;tances
are &s;uch, that they can help him
but little, nor he protect them, and advi&s;es
them to &s;eparate. The Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> with Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> with a &s;trong Body of
Hor&s;e, attempt to get into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to join with
<HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> who was &s;till in the Highlands, though
reduced to a low Ebb; but the&s;e Gentlemen
are fallen upon on every Side and routed, and
at la&s;t being totally broken and di&s;per&s;ed, they
fly to the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI>'s Protection in the I&s;le
of Man.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> Collonel <HI>Ger|rard,</HI>
and above 400 Gentlemen, all Officers
of Hor&s;e, lay their Commi&s;&s;ions down, and &s;iez|ing,
upon <HI>Wooton</HI> Hou&s;e for a Retreat, make
Propo&s;als to the Parliament to leave the King|dom,
upon their Parole not to return again in
Arms again&s;t the Parliament, which was accep|ted,
though afterwards the Princes declined
it. I &s;ent my Man Po&s;t to the Prince to be
included in this Treaty, and for Leave for all
that would accept of like Conditions, but they
had given in the Li&s;t of their Names, and could
not alter it.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ad Time; the poor Remains of
the King's Fortunes went every where to wreck;
every Garri&s;on of the Enemy was full of the
Cavalier Pri&s;oners, and every Garri&s;on the
King had was belet with Enemies, either
blocked up or be&s;ieged. <HI>Goring</HI> and the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> were the only Remainders of the King's
Forces, which kept in a Body, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> was
<PB N="313" REF="319">
pu&s;hing them with all $maginable Vigour with
his whole Army, about <HI>Exeter,</HI> and other Parts
of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>In this Condition the King left <HI>Newark</HI> in the
Night, and got to <HI>Oxford.</HI> The King had in
<HI>Oxford</HI> 8000 Men, and the Towns of <HI>Banbury,
Farrington, Durnnington</HI> Ca&s;tle, and &s;uch Places
as might have been brought together in 24
Hours, 15 or 20000 Men, with which if he
had then re&s;olved to have quitted the Place,
and collected the Forces in <HI>Worce&s;ter, Hereford,
Lichfield, A&s;hby de la Zouch,</HI> and all the &s;mall
Ca&s;tles and Garri&s;ons he had thereabouts, he
might have had near 40000 Men, might have
beaten the <HI>Scots</HI> from <HI>Newark,</HI> Collonel <HI>Jones</HI> from
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and all, before <HI>Fairfax</HI> who was in the
We&s;t, could be able to come to their Relief, and
this his Maje&s;ty's Friends in North <HI>Wal$s</HI> had
concerted; and, in order to it, Sir <HI>Jacob Ashby</HI>
gathered what Forces he could, in our Parts,
and attempted to join the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and
to have propo&s;ed it to him; but Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> was
entirely routed at <HI>Stow on the Would,</HI> and taken
Pri&s;oner, and of 3000 Men not above 600 came
to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>All the King's Garri&s;ons dropt one by one;
<HI>Hereford</HI> which had &s;tood out again&s;t the whole
Army of the <HI>Scots</HI> was &s;urprized by &s;ix Men and
a Lieutenant dre&s;&s;ed up for Country Labourers,
and a Con&s;table pre&s;&s;ed to work, who cut the
Guards in Pieces, and let in a Party of the
Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Che&s;ter</HI> was reduced by Famine, all the At|tempts
the King made to relieve it being fru|&s;trated.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> routed the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> at
<HI>Forrigton,</HI> and drove him to &s;uch Extremities,
<PB N="314" REF="320">
that he was forced up into the farthe&s;t Corner
of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had a gallant
Body of Hor&s;e with him of nine Brigades, but
no Foot; <HI>Fairfax,</HI> a great Army.</P>
<P>Heartle&s;s, and tired out with continual ill
News, and ill Succe&s;s, I had frequent Meetings
with &s;ome Gentlemen, who had e&s;caped from
the Rout of Sir <HI>William Vaughan,</HI> and we agreed
upon a Meeting at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> of all the Friends
we could get, to &s;ee if we could rai&s;e a Body fit
to do any Service; or, if not, to con&s;ider what
was to be done. At this Meeting we had almo&s;t
as many Opinions as People; our Strength ap|peared
too weak to make any Attempt, the
Game was too far gone in our Parts to be retrie|ved;
all we could make up did not amount to
above 800 Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>'Twas unanimou&s;ly agreed not to go into the
Parliament as long as our Royal Ma&s;ter did not
give up the Cau&s;e; but in all Places, and by all
po&s;&s;ible Methods, to do him all the Service we
could. Some propo&s;ed one thing, &s;ome another;
at la&s;t we propo&s;ed getting Ve&s;&s;els to carry us
to the I&s;le of <HI>Man</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> as Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and others had
done. I did not fore&s;ee any Service it would be
to the King's Affairs, but I &s;tarted a Propo&s;al,
that marching to <HI>Pembrook</HI> in a Body, we &s;ould
there &s;ieze upon all the Ve&s;&s;els we could, and
embarking our &s;elves, Hor&s;es, and what Foot
we could get, cro&s;s the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, and land in
<HI>Cornwall</HI> to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> who
was in the Army of the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and where
only there &s;eemed to be any Po&s;&s;ibility of a
Chance for the remaining part of our Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;al was not without its Difficulties,
as how to get to the Sea-&s;ide, and, when there,
<PB N="315" REF="321">
what A&s;&s;urance of Shipping. The Enemy, under
Major General <HI>Langhorn</HI> had over-run <HI>Wales,</HI>
and 'twould be next to impo&s;&s;ible to effect it.</P>
<P>We could never carry our Propo&s;al with the
whole A&s;&s;embly; but however, about 200 of
us re&s;olved to attempt it, and Meeting being
broke up without coming to any Conclu&s;ion, we
had a private Meeting among our &s;elves to
effect it.</P>
<P>We di&s;patched private Me&s;&s;engers to <HI>Swanzey</HI>
and <HI>Pembrook,</HI> and other Places; but they all
di&s;couraged us from the Attempt that way, and
advi&s;ed us to go higher towards North <HI>Wales,</HI>
where the King's Intere&s;t had more Friends, and
the Parliament no Forces. Upon this we met,
and re&s;olved, and having &s;ent &s;everal Me&s;&s;engers
that Way, one of my Men provided us two
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els in a little Creek near <HI>Harlegh</HI> Ca|&s;tle,
in <HI>Merioneth&s;hire.</HI> We marched away with
what Expedition we could, and embarked in
the two Ve&s;&s;els accordingly. It was the wor&s;t
Voyage &s;ure that ever Man went; for fir&s;t, we
had no Manner of Accomodation for &s;o many
People, Hay for our Hor&s;es we got none, or
very little, but good Store of Oats, which
&s;erved us for our own Bread as well as Provender
for the Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>In this Condition we put off to Sea, and
had a fair Wind all the fir&s;t Night, but early
in the Morning a &s;udden Storm drove us within
two or three Leagues of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In this Pickle
Sea-Sick our Hor&s;es rouling about upon one a|nother,
and our &s;elves &s;tifled for want of Room,
no Cabins nor Beds, very cold Weather, and
very indifferent Diet, we wi&s;hed our &s;elves a|&s;hore
again a thou&s;and times; and yet we were
not willing to go on Shore in <HI>Ireland,</HI> if we could
<PB N="316" REF="322">
help it; for the Rebels having Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every
Place, that was ju&s;t having our Throats cut at
once. Having rouled about at the Mercy of the
Winds all Day, the Storm cea&s;ing in the Even|ing,
we had fair Weather again, but Wind
enough, which being large, in two Days and a
Night we came upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and,
to our no &s;mall Comfort, landed the next Day
at St. <HI>$ves</HI> in the County of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>We re&s;ted our &s;elves here, and &s;ent an Expre&s;s
to the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who was then in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI>
of our Arrival, and de&s;ired him to a&s;&s;ign us Quar|ters,
and &s;end us his farther Orders. His Lord|&s;hip
expre&s;&s;ed a very great Satisfaction at our
Arrival, and left it to our own Conduct to join
him as we &s;aw convenient.</P>
<P>We were marching to join him, when News
came, that <HI>Fairfax</HI> had given him an entire De|feat
at <HI>Torrington.</HI> This was but the old Story
over again; we had been u&s;ed to ill News a
great while, and 'twas the le&s;s Surprize to us.</P>
<P>Upon this News we halted at <HI>Bodmin,</HI> till we
&s;hould hear farther; and it was not long be|fore
we &s;aw a Confirmation of the News before
our Eyes; for the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> with the Re|mainder
of his Hor&s;e, which he had brought
off at <HI>Torrington</HI> in a very &s;hattered Condition,
retreated to <HI>Lance&s;ton,</HI> the fir&s;t Town in <HI>Corn|wall,</HI>
and hearing that <HI>Fairfax</HI> pur&s;ued him,
came on to <HI>Bodmin.</HI> Hither he &s;ummoned all
the Troops which he had left, which when he
had got together, were a fine Body indeed of 5000
Hor&s;e, but few Foot but what were at <HI>Pendennis,
Barn&s;table,</HI> and other Garri&s;ons; the&s;e were com|manded
by the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>
had taken &s;hipping for <HI>France,</HI> to get Relief, a
few Days before.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="323">
Here a Grand Council of War was called, and
&s;everal things were propo&s;ed, but as it always
is in Di&s;tre&s;s, People are mo&s;t irre&s;olute, &s;o
'twas here: Some were for breaking through by
Force, our Number being &s;uperiour to the
Enemy's Hor&s;e. To fight them with their Foot
would be De&s;peration, and ridiculous; and to
retreat, would but be to coop up them&s;elves in
a narrow Place, where at la&s;t they mu&s;t be
forced to fight upon Di&s;advantage, or yield at
Mercy. Others oppo&s;ed this as a de&s;perate Acti|on,
and without Probability of Succe&s;s; and all
were of different Opinions: I confe&s;s, when I
&s;aw how things were, I &s;aw 'twas a lo&s;t Game,
and I was for the Opinion of breaking through,
and doing it now, while the Country was open
and large, and not being forced to it when it
mu&s;t be with more Di&s;advantage; but nothing
was re&s;olved on, and &s;o we retreated before the
Enemy. Some &s;mall Skirmi&s;hes there happen|ed
near <HI>Bodmin,</HI> but none that were very con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>'Twas the 1&s;t of <HI>March</HI> when we quitted
<HI>Bodmin,</HI> and quartered at large at <HI>Columb, St.
Denis</HI> and <HI>Truro,</HI> and the Enemy took his Quar|ters
at <HI>Bodmin,</HI> po&s;ting his Hor&s;e at the Pa&s;&s;es
from <HI>Pad&s;tow</HI> on the North, to <HI>War-bridge Le&s;ti|thel</HI>
and <HI>Foy,</HI> &s;preading &s;o from Sea to Sea, that
now breaking through was impo&s;&s;ible. There
was no more Room for Coun&s;el; for unle&s;s we had
Ships to carry us off, we had nothing to do but
when we were fallen upon, to defend our &s;elves,
and &s;ell Victory as dear as we could to the
Enemies.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;eeing the Di&s;tre&s;s we
were in, and loath to fall into the Enemy's Hands,
&s;hips him&s;elf on board &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els at <HI>Falmouth,</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="324">
with about 400 Lords and Gentlemen; and, as I
had no Command here, to oblige my Attendance, I
was once going to make one; but my Come|rades,
whom I had been the principal Occa&s;ion
of bringing hither, began to take it ill, that I
would leave them, and &s;o I re&s;olved we would
take our Fate together.</P>
<P>While thus we had nothing before us but a
Soldier's Death, a fair Field, and a &s;trong Enemy,
and People began to look one upon another: The
Soldiers asked how their Officers looked, and the
Officers asked how their Soldiers looked, and
every Day we expected to be our la&s;t, when
unexpectedly the Enemy's General &s;ent a Trum|pet
to <HI>Truro</HI> to my Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> with a very
Hand&s;om Gentleman-like Offer.</P>
<P>That &s;ince the General could not be igno|rant
of his pre&s;ent Condition, and that the Place
he was in could not afford him Sub&s;i&s;tance or
Defence; and e&s;pecially con&s;idering that the
State of our Affairs were &s;uch, that if we &s;hould
e&s;cape from thence, we could not remove to
our Advantage, he had thought good to let us
know, <HI>That if we would deliver up our Hor&s;es and
Arms, he would, for avoiding the Effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian
Blood, or the putting any un&s;oldiery Extremities upon
us, allow &s;uch honourable and &s;afe Conditions, as were
rather better than our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances could de|mand,
and &s;uch as &s;hould di&s;charge him to all the
World, as a Gentleman, as a Soldier and as a
Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>After this followed the Conditions he would
give us, which were as follows, (<HI>viz.) That all
the Soldiery, as well</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>as Foreigners, &s;hould have
Liberty to go beyond the Seas, or to their own Dwel|lings,
as they plea&s;ed; and to &s;uch as &s;hall chu&s;e to live
at home, Protection for their Liberty, and from all
<PB N="319" REF="325">
Violence, and plundering of Soldiers, and to give them
Bag and Baggage, and all their Goods, except Hor&s;es
and Arms.</HI></P>
<P>That for Officers in Commi&s;&s;ion, and Gentlemen of
Quality, he would allow them Hor&s;es for them&s;elves
and one Servant, or more, &s;uitable to their Quality,
and &s;uch Arms as are &s;uitable to Gentlemen of &s;uch
Quality travelling in Times of Peace; and &s;uch Officers
as would go beyond Sea, &s;hould take with them their
full Arms and Number of Hor&s;es as are allowed in
the Army to &s;uch Officers.</P>
<P>That all the Troopers &s;hould receive on the Delivery
of their Hor&s;es, 20s. a Man, to carry them home;
and the General's Pa&s;s and Recommendation to any
Gentleman who de&s;ires to go to the Parliament to &s;ettle
the Compo&s;ition for their E&s;tates.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, A very honourable Mention of the General,
and Offer of their Mediation to the Parliament, to
treat him as a Man of Honour, and one who has
been tender of the Country, and behaved him&s;elf with
all the Moderation and Candor that could be expected
from an Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon the unexpected Receipt of this Me&s;&s;age,
a Council of War was called, and the Letter
read; no Man offered to &s;peak a Word; the Ge|neral
moved it, but every one was loath to
begin.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, an old Collonel &s;tarts up, and asked
the General what he thought might occa&s;ion
the writing this Letter? The General told him,
<HI>he could not tell;</HI> but he could tell he was &s;ure
of one thing, that he knew what was not the
Occa&s;ion of it (<HI>viz.</HI>) That is, not any want of
Force in their Army to oblige us to other Terms.
Then a Doubt was &s;tarted, whether the King
and Parliament were not in any Treaty, which
this Agreement might be prejudicial to.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="326">
This occa&s;ioned a Letter to my Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI>
wherein our General returning the Civilities,
and neither accepting nor refu&s;ing his Propo&s;al,
put it upon his Honour, whether there was not
&s;ome Agreement or Conce&s;&s;ion between his
Maje&s;ty and the Parliament, in order to a Ge|neral
Peace, which this Treaty might be pre|judicial
to, or thereby be prejudicial to us.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> ingenuou&s;ly declared, he
had heard the King had made &s;ome Conce&s;&s;ions,
and he heartily wi&s;hed he would make &s;uch
as would &s;ettle the Kingdom in Peace, that
<HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> might not wound and de&s;troy one a|nother;
<HI>but that he declared he knew of no Treaty
commenced, nor any Thing pa&s;t which could give us the
lea&s;t Shadow of hope for any Advantage in not accept|ing
his Conditions.</HI> At la&s;t telling us, <HI>That though
he did not in&s;ult over our Circum&s;tances, yet if we
thought fit, upon any &s;uch Suppo&s;ition, to refu&s;e his
Offers, he was not to &s;eek in his Mea&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P>And it appeared &s;o, for he immediately ad|vanced
his Forlorns, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed us of two
advanced Quarters, and thereby &s;treightened
us yet more.</P>
<P>We had now nothing to &s;ay, but treat, and
our General was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of our Condition,
that he returned the Trumpet with a &s;afe Con|duct
for Commi&s;&s;ioners at 12 a Clock that Night;
upon which a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms was agreed
on, we quitting <HI>Truro</HI> to the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI>
and he left St <HI>Allan</HI>'s to us to keep our head
Quarter.</P>
<P>The Conditions were &s;oon agreed on, we di&s;|banded
nine full Brigades of Hor&s;e, and all the
Conditions were ob&s;erved with the mo&s;t Honour
and Care by the Enemy that ever I &s;aw in my
Life.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="327">
Nor can I omit to make very honourable Men|tion
of this noble Gentleman, though I did not
like his Cau&s;e; but I never &s;aw a Man of a more
plea&s;ant, calm, courteous, down-right, hone&s;t
Behaviour in my Life; and, for his Courage
and per&s;onal Bravery in the Field, that we
had felt enough of. No Man in the World had
more Fire and Fury in him while in Action,
or more Temper and Softne&s;s out of it. In
&s;hort, and I cannot do him greater Honour,
he excedingly came near the Character of my
Foreign Heroe <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> and in my Ac|count,
is, of all the Soldiers in <HI>Europe,</HI> the fit|te&s;t
to be reckoned in the &s;econd Place of Ho|nour
to him.</P>
<P>I had particular Occa&s;ion to &s;ee much of his
Temper in all this Action, being one of the
Ho&s;tages given by our General for the Perfor|mance
of the Conditions, in which Circum&s;tance
the General did me &s;everal times the Honour to
&s;end to me to dine with him; and was exceed|ingly
plea&s;ed to di&s;cour&s;e with me about the
Pa&s;&s;ages of the Wars in <HI>Germany,</HI> which I had
&s;erved in; he having been at the &s;ame time in
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> in the Service of Prince <HI>Mau|rice;</HI>
but I ob&s;erved if at any time my Civilities
extended to Commendations of his own Actions,
and e&s;pecially to comparing him to <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adol|phus,</HI>
he would blu&s;h like a Woman, and be
unea&s;y, declining the Di&s;cour&s;e, and in this he
was &s;till more like him.</P>
<P>Let no Man &s;cruple my honourable Mention
of this noble Enemy, &s;ince no Man can &s;u&s;pect
me of favouring the Cau&s;e he embarked in, which
I &s;erved as heartily again&s;t as any Man in the
Army; but I cannot conceal extraordinary Me|rit
for its being placed in an Enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="328">
This was the End of our making War; for
now we were all under Parole never to bear
Arms again&s;t the Parliament; and though &s;ome
of us did not keep our Word, yet I think a
Soldier's Parole ought to be the mo&s;t &s;acred in
&s;uch Ca&s;e, that a Soldier may be the ea&s;ier
tru&s;ted at all Times upon his Word.</P>
<P>For my Part I went home fully contented,
&s;ince I could do my Royal Ma&s;ter no better
Service, that I had come off no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Enemy going now on in a full Current
of Succe&s;s, and the King reduced to the la&s;t
Extremity, and <HI>Fairfax,</HI> by long Marches, being
come back within five Miles of <HI>Oxford;</HI> his Ma|je&s;ty
loath to be cooped up in a Town which
could on no Account hold long out, quits the
Town in a Di&s;gui&s;e, leaving Sir <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI>
Governour, and being only attended with Mr.
<HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> and one more, rides away to <HI>New|ark</HI>
and there fatally committed him&s;elf to the
Honour and Fidelity of the <HI>Scots,</HI> under General
<HI>Leven.</HI></P>
<P>There had been &s;ome little Bickering between
the Parliament and the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners,
concerning the Propo&s;itions which the <HI>Scots</HI> were
for a Treaty with the King upon, and the
Parliament refu&s;ed it. The Parliament, upon
all Propo&s;als of Peace, had formerly invited
the King to come and throw him&s;elf upon the
Honour, Fidelity and Affection of his Parlia|ment;
and now the King from <HI>Oxford</HI> offering
to come up to <HI>London,</HI> on the Protection of the
Parliament for the Safety of his Per&s;on, they
refu&s;ed him, and the <HI>Scots</HI> differed from them
in it, and were for a per&s;onal Treaty.</P>
<P>This, in our Opinion, was the Rea&s;on which
prompted the King to throw him&s;elf upon the Fi|delity
<PB N="323" REF="329">
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who really by their In&s;idelity
had been the Ruine of all his Affairs, and now,
by their perfidious Breach of Honour and
Faith with him, will be virtually and mediately
the Ruine of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> were, as all the Nation be&s;ides them
was, &s;urprized at the King's coming among them;
the Parliament began very high with them, and
&s;end an Order to General <HI>Leven</HI> to &s;end the
King to <HI>Warwick</HI> Ca&s;tle; but he was not &s;o ha&s;ty
to part with &s;o rich a Prize. As &s;oon as the
King came to the General, he &s;igns an Order
to Collonel <HI>Balla&s;is,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Newark,</HI>
to &s;urrender it, and immediately the <HI>Scots</HI> de|camp
homewards, carrying the King in the
Camp with them, and marching on, a Hou&s;e
was ordered to be provided for the King at
<HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>And now the Parliament &s;aw their Error,
in refu&s;ing his Maje&s;ty a Per&s;onal Treaty, which
if they had accepted, (their Army was not yet
taught the way of huffing their Ma&s;ters,) the
Kingdom might have been &s;ettled in Peace.
Upon this the Parliament &s;end to General <HI>Le|ven</HI>
to have his Maje&s;ty not <HI>be &s;ent,</HI> which was
their fir&s;t Language, but <HI>be &s;uffered to come</HI> to
<HI>London,</HI> to treat with his Parliament; before it
was, <HI>Let the King be &s;ent to</HI> Warwick <HI>Ca&s;tle;</HI> now
'tis, <HI>To let his Maje&s;ty come to</HI> London <HI>to treat with
his People.</HI></P>
<P>But neither one or the other would do with
the <HI>Scots;</HI> but we who knew the <HI>Scots</HI> be&s;t, knew
that there was <HI>one Thing</HI> would do with them, if
the other would not, and that was Money; and
therefore our Hearts aked for the King.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> as I &s;aid, had retreated to <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI>
with the King, and there they quartered
<PB N="324" REF="330">
their whole Army at large upon the Country;
the Parliament voted they had no farther Oc|ca&s;ion
for the <HI>Scots,</HI> and de&s;ired them to go home
about their Bu&s;ine&s;s. I do not &s;ay it was in the&s;e
Words, but in what&s;oever good Words their
Me&s;&s;ages might be expre&s;&s;ed, this and nothing
le&s;s was the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of it. The <HI>Scots</HI> reply, by
&s;etting forth ther Loffes Damages, and Dues,
the Sub&s;tance of which was, <HI>Pay us our Money, and
we will be gone, or el&s;e we won't &s;tir.</HI> The Parliament
call for an Account of their Demands, which the
<HI>Scots</HI> give in, amounting to a Million; but, ac|cording
to their Cu&s;tom, and e&s;pecially finding
that the Army under <HI>Fairfax</HI> inclined gradual|ly
that Way, fall down to 500000l. and at la&s;t
to four; but all the while this is tran&s;acting, a
&s;eparate Treaty is carried on at <HI>London</HI> with
the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards
at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by which it is given them to
under&s;tand, that whereas upon Payment of the
Money, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army is to march out of
<HI>England,</HI> and to give up all the Towns and Gar|ri&s;ons
which they hold in this Kingdom, &s;o
they are to take it for granted, that 'tis the
meaning of the Treaty, that they &s;hall leave the
King in the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>To make this go down the better, the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Parliament, upon his Maje&s;ty's De&s;ire to go
with their Army into <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;end him for
An&s;wer, that it cannot be for the Safety of his
Maje&s;ty or of the State, to come into <HI>Sc$tland,</HI>
not having taken the Covenant, and this was
carried in their Parliament but by two Voices.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> having refu&s;ed his coming into
<HI>Scotland,</HI> as was concerted between the two
Hou&s;es, and their Army being to march out
of <HI>England,</HI> the delivering up the King became
<PB N="325" REF="331">
a Con&s;equence of the Thing unavoidable, and
of Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty thus de&s;erted of tho&s;e into who&s;e
Hands he had thrown him&s;elf, took his Leave
of the <HI>Scots</HI> General at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> telling him
only, in few Words, this &s;ad Truth, <HI>That he was
Bought and Sold.</HI> The Parliament Commi&s;&s;ioners
received him at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> from the <HI>Scots,</HI> and
brought him to <HI>Holmby</HI> Hou&s;e, in <HI>Northamton|&s;hire;</HI>
from whence, upon the Quarrels and
Feuds of Parties, he was fetched by a Party
of Hor&s;e, commanded by one Cornet <HI>Joyce,</HI>
from the Army, upon their mutinous Rendez|vous
at <HI>Triplow-Heath;</HI> and, after this, &s;uffering
many Violences, and Varieties of Circum&s;tances
among the Army, was carried to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
from whence his Maje&s;ty very readily made his
E&s;cape; but not having Notice enough to pro|vide
effectual Means for his more effectual Deli|verance
was obliged to deliver him&s;elf to Collo|nel
<HI>Hammond</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI> Here, after
&s;ome very indifferent U&s;age, the Parliament
pur&s;ued a farther Treaty with him, and all
Points were agreed but two. The entire Abo|li&s;hing
Epi&s;copacy, which the King declared
to be again&s;t his Con&s;cience, and his Coronation
Oath; and the Sale of the Church-Lands, which
he declared, being mo&s;t of them Gifts to God
and the Church, by Per&s;ons decea&s;ed, his
Maje&s;ty thought could not be alienated without
the higheft Sacrilege, and if taken from the
U&s;es to which they were appointed by the Wills
of the Donors, ought to be re&s;tored back to
the Heirs and Families of the Per&s;ons who
bequeathed them.</P>
<P>And the&s;e two Articles &s;o &s;tuck with his
Maje&s;ty, that he ventured his Fortune and
<PB N="326" REF="332">
Royal Family, and his own Life for them:
However, at la&s;t, the King conde&s;cended &s;o far
in the&s;e, that the Parliament voted his Ma|je&s;ty's
Conce&s;&s;ions to be &s;ufficient to &s;ettle and
e&s;tabli&s;h the Peace of the Nation.</P>
<P>This Vote di&s;covered the bottom of all the
Coun&s;els which then prevailed; for the Army, who
knew if Peace were once &s;ettled, they &s;hould
be undone, took the Alarm at this, and clubbing
together in Committees and Councils, at la&s;t
brought them&s;elves to a Degree of Hardne&s;s
above all that ever this Nation &s;aw; for, cal|ling
into Que&s;tion the Proceedings of their
Ma&s;ters who employed them, they immediately
fall to Work upon the Parliament, remove Col|lonel
<HI>Hammond,</HI> who had the Charge of the
King, and u&s;ed him honourably, place a new
Guard upon him, di&s;mi&s;s the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
and put a Stop to the Treaty; and, following
their Blow, march to <HI>London,</HI> place Regiments
of Foot at the Parliament Hou&s;e Door, and,
as the Members came up, &s;ieze upon all tho&s;e
whom they had down in a Li&s;t as Promoters of
the Settlement and Treaty, and would not
&s;uffer them to fit; but the re&s;t, who being of
their own Stamp, are permitted to go on, carry
on the De&s;igns of the Army, revive their
Votes of Non-Addre&s;&s;es to the King, and then,
upon the Army's Petition, to bring all Delin|quents
to Ju&s;tice; the Ma&s;que was thrown off,
the Word all is declared to be meant the King,
as well as every Man el&s;e they plea&s;ed. 'Tis
too &s;ad a Story, and too much a Matter of Grief
to me, and to all good Men, to renew the Black|ne&s;s
of tho&s;e Days, when Law and Ju&s;tice was
under the Feet of Power; the Army ruled the
Parliament, the private Officers their Generals,
<PB N="327" REF="333">
the common Soldiers their Officers, and Con|fu&s;ion
was in every Part of the Government: In
this Hurry they &s;acrificed their King, and
&s;hed the Blood of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility without
Mercy.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the Times will &s;upply the Pa|ticulars
which I omit, being willing to confine
my &s;elf to my own Accounts and Ob&s;ervations;
I was now no more an Actor, but a melancholly
Ob&s;ervator of the Misfortunes of the Times. I
had given my Parole not to take up Arms again&s;t
the Parliament, and I &s;aw nothing to invite me
to engage on their Side; I &s;aw a World of
Confu&s;ion in all their Coun&s;els, and I always
expected that in a Chain of Di&s;tractions, as it
generally fals out, the la&s;t Link would be De|&s;truction;
and though I pretended to no Pro|phecy,
yet the Progre&s;s of Affairs have brought
it to pa&s;s, and I have &s;een Providence, who &s;uf|fered,
for the Correction of this Nation, the
Sword to govern and devour us, has at la&s;t
brought De&s;truction <HI>by the Sword,</HI> upon the Head
of mo&s;t of the Party who fir&s;t drew it.</P>
<P>If together with the brief Account of what Con|cern
I had in the Active Part of the War, I leave
behind me &s;ome of my own Remarks and Ob|&s;ervations,
it may be pertinent enough to my
De&s;ign, and not unu&s;eful to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>1. I ob&s;erved by the Sequel of Things, that
it may be &s;ome Excu&s;e to the fir&s;t Parliament,
who began this War, to &s;ay that they manife|&s;ted
their De&s;igns were not aimed at the Monar|chy,
nor their Quarrel at the Per&s;on of the
King; becau&s;e, when they had him in their
Power, though again&s;t his Will, they would have
re&s;tored both his Per&s;on and Dignity as a King,
only loading it with &s;uch Clogs of the People's
<PB N="328" REF="334">
Power as they at fir&s;t pretended to, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
the Militia, and Power of naming the great
Officers at Court, and the like; which Powers,
it was never denied, had been &s;tretched too
far in the Beginning of this King's Reign, and
&s;everal things done illegally, which his Maje&s;ty
had been &s;en&s;ible of, and was willing to rectify;
but they having obtained the Power by Victory,
re&s;olved &s;o to &s;ecure them&s;elves, as that when|ever
they laid down their Arms, the King
&s;hould not be able to do the like again: And
thus far they were not to be &s;o much blamed,
and we did not, on our own Part, blame them,
when they had obtained the Power, for parting
with it on good Terms.</P>
<P>But when I have thus far advocated for
the Enemies, I mu&s;t be very free to &s;tate the
Crimes of this Bloody War, by the Events of
it. 'Tis manife&s;t there were among them,
from the Beginning, a Party who aimed at the
very Root of the Government, and at the very
thing which they brought to pa&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> The
depo&s;ing and murthering of their Sovereign;
and, as the Devil is always Ma&s;ter where Mi&s;|chief
is the Work, this Party prevailed, turned
the other out of Doors, and over-turned all
that little Hone&s;ty that might be in the fir&s;t
Beginning of this unhappy Strife.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this was, the Presby|terians
&s;aw their Error when it was too late,
and then would gladly have joined the Royal
Party, to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this new Leaven, which
had infected the Lump; and this is very re|markable,
that mo&s;t of the fir&s;t Champions of
this War, who bore the Brunt of it, when
the King was powerful and pro&s;perous, and
when there was nothing to be got by it but
<PB N="329" REF="335">
Blows, fir&s;t or la&s;t, were &s;o ill u&s;ed by this In|dependant
powerful Party, who tripped up
the Heels of all their Hone&s;ty, that they were
either forced, by ill Treatment, to take up
Arms on our Side, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and reduced by
them. In this the Ju&s;tice of Providence &s;eemed
very con&s;picuous, that the&s;e having pu&s;hed all
things by Violence again&s;t the King, and by
Arms and Force brought him to their Will,
were at once both robbed of the End, their
Church-Government, and puni&s;hed for draw|ing
their Swords again&s;t <HI>their Ma&s;ters,</HI> by <HI>their
own Servants</HI> drawing the Sword again&s;t them;
and God, in his due Time, puni&s;hed the others
too: And, what was yet farther &s;trange, the
Puni&s;hment of this Crime of making War again&s;t
their King, &s;ingled out tho&s;e very Men, both
in the Army and in the Parliament, who were
the greate&s;t Champions of the Presbyterian Cau&s;e
in the Council, and in the Field. Some Mi|nutes
too of Circum&s;tances I cannot forbear ob&s;er|ing,
though they are not very material, as to
the Fatality and Revolutions of Days and
Times.</P>
<P>A <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Gentleman of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> a
very religious Man in his way, who had kept a
Calculate of Times, and had ob&s;erved mightily
the Fatality of Times, Places and Actions, be|ing
at my Father's Hou&s;e, was di&s;cour&s;ing once
upon the ju&s;t Judgment of God in dating his
Providences, &s;o as to &s;ignify to us his Di&s;plea&s;ure
at particular Circum&s;tances; and among an in|finite
Number of Collections he had made, the&s;e
were &s;ome which I took particular Notice of,
and from whence I began to ob&s;erve the like.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="336">

<P>How ju&s;t his Calculations were, or how true

<P>1. Sir <HI>John Hotham,</HI> who repul&s;ed his Maje&s;ty

<P>8. <HI>Richard Cromwell</HI> re&s;igning becau&s;e he could

<P>10. <HI>Monk</HI> being taken Pri&s;oner at <HI>Nantwich</HI> by

<P>Some other Ob&s;ervations I have made, which
as not &s;o pertinent I forbear to publi&s;h, among
which I have noted the Fatality of &s;ome Days
to Parties, as,</P>
<P>The 2d of <HI>September,</HI> the Fight at <HI>Dunbar;</HI> the
Fight at <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> the Oath again&s;t a &s;ingle

taken by Storm; King <HI>Charles</HI> II. re&s;tored:
Ditto.</P>
<P>Fatality of Circum&s;tances in this unhappy
War, as,</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="341">
1. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament call in the <HI>Scots,</HI> to
invade their King, and are invaded them&s;elves
by the &s;ame <HI>Scots,</HI> in Defence of the King who&s;e
Ca&s;e, and the De&s;ign of the Parliament the
<HI>Scots</HI> had mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Scots,</HI> who unju&s;tly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Parlia|ment
to conquer their lawful Sovereign, con|trary
to their Oath of Allegiance, and without
any Pretence on the King's Part, are after|wards
ab&s;olutely conquered and &s;ubdued by
the &s;ame Parliament they a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>3. The Parliament, who rai&s;ed an Army to
depo&s;e their King, depo&s;ed by the very Army
they had rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>4. The Army broke three Parliaments,
and are at la&s;t broke by a free Parliament
and all they had done by the Military Power,
undone at once by the Civil.</P>
<P>5. Abundance of the Chief Men, who by
their fiery Spirits involved the Nation in a Civil
War, and took up Arms again&s;t their Prince, fir&s;t
or la&s;t met with Ruine or Di&s;grace from their
own Party.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> and his Son, who &s;truck
the fir&s;t Stroke, both beheaded or hanged by
the Parliament.</P>
<P>2. Major General <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> three times taken
Pri&s;oner by them, and once wounded at <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>3. Major General <HI>Langhorn.</HI> 4. Collonel <HI>Poyer:</HI>
And, 5. Collonel <HI>Powell,</HI> changed Sides, and at
la&s;t taken, could obtain no other Favour than
to draw Lots for their Lives; Collonel <HI>Poyer</HI>
drew the Dead Lot, and was &s;hot to Death.</P>
<P>6. Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who, when the Hou&s;e voted
who &s;hould be reprieved, Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> who
<PB N="336" REF="342">
had been their wor&s;t Enemy, or the Earl of
<HI>Holland,</HI> who, excepting one Offence, had been
their con&s;tant Servant, voted <HI>Goring</HI> to be
&s;pared, and the Earl to die.</P>
<P>7. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> their fir&s;t General.</P>
<P>8. Sir <HI>William Waller.</HI></P>
<P>9. Lieutenant General <HI>Ludlow.</HI></P>
<P>10. The Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>All di&s;gu&s;ted and voted out of the Army,
though they had &s;tood the fir&s;t Shock of the War,
to make way for the new Model of the Army,
and introduce a Party.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Confu&s;ions I have ob&s;erved two
great Errors, one of the King, and one of his
Friends.</P>
<P>Of the King, that when he was in their Cu|&s;tody,
and at their Mercy, he did not comply
with their Propo&s;itions of Peace before their
Army, for want of Employment, fell into Heats
and Mutinies; that he did not at fir&s;t grant
the <HI>Scots</HI> their own Conditions, which, if he
had done, he had gone into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and then,
if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would have fought the <HI>Scots</HI> for
him, he had a Re&s;erve of his loyal Friends,
who would have had Room to have fallen in
with the <HI>Scots</HI> to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, who were af|ter
di&s;per&s;ed and de&s;troyed in &s;mall Parties at|tempting
to &s;erve him.</P>
<P>While his Maje&s;ty remained at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> the
Queen wrote to him, per&s;wading him to make
Peace upon any Terms; and in Politicks her
Maje&s;ty's Advice was certainly the be&s;t: For,
however low he was brought by a Peace, it
mu&s;t have been better than the Condition he
was then in.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="343">
The Error I mention of the King's Friends
was this, that after they &s;aw all was lo&s;t, they
could not be content to &s;it &s;till, and re&s;erve
them&s;elves for better Fortunes, and wait the
happy Time when the Divi&s;ions of the Ene|my
would bring them to certain Ruin; but
mu&s;t ha&s;ten their own Mi&s;eries by frequent
fruitle&s;s Ri&s;ings, in the Face of a victorious Ene|my,
in &s;mall Parties, and I always found the&s;e
Effects from it.</P>
<P>1. The Enemy, who were always together
by the Ears, when they were let alone, were
united and reconciled when we gave them any
Interruption; as particularly, in the Ca&s;e of
the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault the Army made upon them,
when Collonel <HI>Pride,</HI> with his Regiment garbled
the Hou&s;e, as they called it, at that Time,
a fair Opportunity offered; but it was omit|ted
till it was too late: That In&s;ult upon the
Hou&s;e had been attempted the Year before,
but was hindered by the little In&s;urrections of
the Royal Party, and the &s;ooner they had fal|len
out, the better.</P>
<P>2. The&s;e Ri&s;ings being de&s;perate, with va&s;t
Di&s;advantages, and always &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, ruined
all our Friends; the Remnants of the Cavaliers
were le&s;&s;ened, the &s;toute&s;t and mo&s;t daring
were cut off, and the King's Intere&s;t exceed|ingly
weakened, there not being le&s;s than Thir|ty
Thou&s;and of his be&s;t Friends cut off in the
&s;everal Attempts made at <HI>Maid&s;tone, Colche&s;ter,
Lanca&s;hire, Pembrook, Pontfract, King&s;ton, Pre&s;ton,
Warrington, Worce&s;ter,</HI> and other Places. Had
the&s;e Men all re&s;erved their Fortunes to a Con|junction
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> at either of the Inva|&s;ions
they made into this Kingdom, and acted
with the Conduct and Courage they were known
<PB N="338" REF="344">
Ma&s;ters of, perhaps neither of tho&s;e <HI>Scots</HI> Armies
had been defeated.</P>
<P>But the Impatience of our Friends ruin'd all;
for my Part, I had as good a Mind to put my
Hand to the Ruine of the Enemy as any of them,
but I never &s;aw any tolerable Appearance of a
Force able to match the Enemy, and I had no
Mind to be beaten, and then hanged. Had we
let them alone, they would have fallen into &s;o
many Parties and Factions, and &s;o effectually have
torn one another to Pieces, that which &s;oever
Party had come to us, we &s;hould, with them,
have been too hard for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This was plain by the Cour&s;e of Things after|wards,
when the Independant Army had ruffled
the Presbyterian Parliament, the Soldiery of that
Party made no Scruple to join us, and would
have re&s;tored the King with all their Hearts,
and many of them did join us at la&s;t.</P>
<P>And the Con&s;equence, though late, ended &s;o;
for they fell out &s;o many times, <HI>Army</HI> and <HI>Par|liament,
Parliament</HI> and <HI>Army,</HI> and alternately pul|led
one another down &s;o often, till at la&s;t the
Presbyterians, who began the War, ended it;
and, to be rid of their Enemies, rather than for
any Love to the Monarchy, re&s;tored King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second, and brought him in on the very Day
that they them&s;elves had formerly re&s;olved the
Ruine of his Father's Government, being the 29th
of <HI>May,</HI> the &s;ame Day 20 Year that the private
Cabal in <HI>London</HI> concluded their Secret League
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> to embroil his Father King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Fir&s;t.</P>
