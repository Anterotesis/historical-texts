<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THESEUS,</HI> Duke of <HI>Athens,</HI> having brought the Prince&s;s
<HI>Hippolita</HI> from the <HI>Amazons,</HI> de&s;igns to marry her in a few
days. In the mean time <HI>Egeus,</HI> one of his courtiers, complains
to him of his daughter <HI>Hermia</HI>'s love to <HI>Ly&s;ander,</HI> and aver&s;ion
to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> for whom he intended her. <HI>Hermia</HI> refu&s;es to
marry <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and the Duke allows her four days, either to
obey her father, to be put to death, or to vow perpetual cha|&s;tity.
<HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> per&s;uades her to fly with him from <HI>Athens,</HI> and
marry him: She con&s;ents, and informs her friend <HI>Helena</HI> of
her de&s;ign, who, out of dotage on <HI>Demetrius,</HI> acquaints him
with it. He pur&s;ues <HI>Hermia,</HI> and <HI>Helena</HI> follows him. Thus
they all meet at a wood, &s;ome little di&s;tance from <HI>Athens,</HI>
where they become liable to the power of the <HI>Fairies.
Oberon,</HI> King of the <HI>Fairies,</HI> and <HI>Titania</HI> his Queen, being
come to give a ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>The&s;eus</HI>' wedding, quarrel about
an <HI>Indian</HI> boy, whom the Queen loved, to the rai&s;ing <HI>Obe|ron</HI>'s
jealou&s;y. <HI>Oberon,</HI> in revenge, and to get the boy from
her, charms the Queen to be enamour'd of the fir&s;t live
creature &s;he &s;hould &s;ee, and &s;ends <HI>Puck</HI> with the &s;ame charm
to force <HI>Demetrius</HI> to love <HI>Helena,</HI> but my mi&s;take, <HI>Puck</HI>
charms <HI>Ly&s;ander,</HI> who then loaths <HI>Hermia,</HI> and becomes in
love with <HI>Helena. Oberon,</HI> &s;eeing the mi&s;take, charms <HI>De|metrius,</HI>
who al&s;o falls in love with <HI>Helena.</HI> This produces
a quarrel; but the rivals are prevented fighting by the arti|fice
of <HI>Puck. Oberon,</HI> having got the <HI>Indian</HI> boy, puts an
end to the charm that held the Queen enamoured of a clown:
The lovers being a&s;leep are likewi&s;e freed from the power
of the charm. <HI>The&s;eus, Hippolita, Egeus, &amp;c.</HI> coming to
hunt in the Wood, find the four lovers &s;leeping; they are
waked with the &s;ound of the horns, and <HI>Demetrius</HI> avowing
his love to <HI>Helena,</HI> and <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> avowing his love to <HI>Hermia,</HI>
they are married at the &s;ame time with <HI>The&s;eus</HI> and <HI>Hip|polita.</HI></P>
