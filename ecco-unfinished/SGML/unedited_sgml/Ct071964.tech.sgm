NEW PAPER, &amp;c,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE greate&s;t re&s;pect which cou'd po&s;&s;ibly
have been &s;hown to you by the People
of <HI>England,</HI> had been to have let your
Actions have &s;unk into forgetfulne&s;s, and
in kindne&s;s to you, have let neither you
nor your Deeds have been nam'd any more in your
Native Country.</P>
<P>But &s;ince tho&s;e People who (in your Hou&s;e) were
&s;o re&s;tle&s;s in their Endeavours to ruin us, are not a&s;ham'd
to undertake your Defence: We are oblig'd in the ju&s;t
Vindication of our Native right further to expo&s;e your
Errors, than in Charity to your Memory we de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>We are bound to let the People know, that a late
Pamphlet Printed by your own Club, and indu&s;triou&s;ly
&s;pread over the whole Nation, Entituled, <HI>A Defence of
the last Parliament,</HI> is calculated to Wheedle the People
to Choo&s;e you again.</P>
<P>But we hope their Eyes will be open'd. And we
wonder you can &s;ugge&s;t that the Free-holders &s;hou'd &s;o
contradict the Language of their Addre&s;&s;es, and be found
&s;o to Mock the King and the Nation, as to Addre&s;s
you out of Doors, and then put you in again them|&s;elves:
if they &s;hou'd act &s;o unaccountably, <HI>Kings for
the future will the better know what</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Addre&s;&s;ing
&s;ignifies.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The &s;ame Hand that pre&s;ented your Speaker with a
Certain <HI>Memorial,</HI> call'd the <HI>Legion Paper,</HI> written, as
Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> very well knows, in a hand that &s;tood the
Wrong Way; <HI>that Paper</HI> which came, as is &s;aid, from
Two Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;hmen; that Paper</HI> which
frighted Mr. <HI>P.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H&mdash;t,</HI> and &s;everal others into
the Country; <HI>that Paper</HI> which Mr. <HI>Howe</HI> in a lamentable
Tone told the Hou&s;e, made him <HI>from the &s;en&s;e of his
own Guilt,</HI> afraid of his Life; <HI>that Paper</HI> which put you
all &s;o be&s;ides your &s;elves, as to make a &s;en&s;le&s;s Ad|dre&s;s
to His Maje&s;ty, to defend him&s;elf again&s;t His
People; which Addre&s;s you were afterwards a&s;ham'd
to pre&s;ent; <HI>that Paper</HI> which you had &s;o little Wit as
to read, and &s;o much Mode&s;ty, <HI>that is Guilt,</HI> as to blu&s;h
at; <HI>that Paper</HI> which made you wi&s;h you had never
Committed the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Petitioners, and made you afraid
to pro&s;ecute them; <HI>that Paper</HI> which made you clap up
the Se&s;&s;ions in &s;uch ha&s;te, as made the Lords baffle you,
and all the Nation a&s;ham'd of you; <HI>that Paper</HI> which
made you pa&s;s one good Vote at parting, to <HI>De&s;ire the King
to make Alliances,</HI> &amp;c. which &s;ome of your Members call'd
a Sweetner, that you might not be afraid to go home:
The &s;ame hand pre&s;ents you with this Paper, as the true
&s;en&s;e of the Nation concerning you.</P>
<P>The Author does not come <HI>Incognito</HI> as before, but
you may &s;ee it at the Corner of every Street, every
Book&s;eller can &s;ell it you, every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> has it in his
Head; and your Humble Servant the Author is to be
&s;poken with at his Hou&s;e as con&s;tantly as a Quack-Doctor,
from Eight to Twelve in the Morning, and from Two
till Nine at Night.</P>
<P>It had been time for your Defender to have Voted
the Author of <HI>Legion</HI> to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> when the Charge there
given you in the Name of the People of <HI>England</HI> had
been clear'd.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
And the Author tells you, he will be content with
that Fate when you will fairly di&s;prove one Article of
that yet unan&s;wer'd Paper.</P>
<P>There you may &s;ee, Gentlemen, that the Nation's
Exceptions at your Behaviour, are not to be reduc'd to
Three Heads of your own making; the fir&s;t of which
no Body never charg'd on you, but your new Defender;
but if we mi&s;take not, there are no le&s;s than Fifteen
Articles of Illegal Proceedings, from one of which, you,
nor all the Men alive, cannot fairly parge you, which
for your better Satisfaction are here tran&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>&startq;I. To Rai&s;e Funds for Money, and Declare by
borrowing Clau&s;es, that who&s;oever Advances Money on
tho&s;e Funds, &s;hall be Re-imburs'd out of the next Aids,
if the Funds fall &s;hort; and then give Sub&s;equent Funds,
without Transferring the Deficiency of the former, is
a horrible Cheat on the Subject who lent the Money; $word$
Breach of Publick Faith, and de&s;tructive to the Honour
and Credit of Parliaments.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;II. To Impri&s;on Men who are not your own Mem|bers,
by no proceedings but a Vote of your Hou&s;e, and
to continue them in Cu&s;tody <HI>Sine Die</HI> is Illegal; a Noto|rious
Breach of the Liberty of the People; Setting up
a Di&s;pen&s;ing Power in the Hou&s;e of Commons, which
your Fathers never pretended to; bidding defiance to the
<HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, which is the Bulwark of Per&s;onal
Liberty, De&s;tructive of the Laws, and Betraying the
Tru&s;t repos'd in you. <HI>The King at the &s;ame time being
Obliged to ask you Leave to continue in Cu&s;tody the Horrid
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators of His Per&s;on.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;III. Committing to Cu&s;tody tho&s;e Gentlemen, who
at the Command of the People (who&s;e Servants you
are) and in a Peaceable way put you in mind of your
Duty, is Illegal and Injurious; De&s;tructive of the Sub|jects
Liberty of Petitioning for Redre&s;s of Grievances,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
which has by all Parliaments before you, been acknow|ledged
to be their undoubted Right.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;IV. Voting a Petition from the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI>
In&s;olent; is Ridiculous and Impertinent, becau&s;e the
Free-holders of <HI>England</HI> are your Superiours; and is a
contradiction in it Self, and a Contempt of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Freedom, and contrary to the Nature of Parliamentary
Power.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;V. Voting People Guilty of Bribery and Ill Practices,
and Committing them as afore&s;aid, without Ba$l, and
then upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and kneeling to your Hou&s;e, di&s;|charging
them; Exacting Exorbitant Fees by your Officers,
is Illegal, Betraying the Ju&s;tice of the Nation, Selling
the Liberty of the Subject, encouraging the Extortion
and Villany of Goalers and Officers; and di&s;continuing
the Legal Pro&s;ecutions of Offenders, in the ordinary
Cour&s;e of Law.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;VI. Pro&s;ecuting the Crime of Bribery in &s;ome to &s;erve
a Party, and then proceed no further, tho' proof lay
before you, is Partial and Unju&s;t; and a Scandal upon
the Honour of Parliaments.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;VII. Voting the Treaty of Partition Fatal to <HI>Europe,</HI>
becau&s;e it gave &s;o much of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions to the
<HI>French,</HI> and not concern your &s;elves to prevent their
taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it all. De&s;erting the <HI>Dutch</HI> when
the <HI>Prench</HI> are at their Doors, till it be almo&s;t too late
to help them; is Unju&s;t to our Treaties, and unkind
to our Confederates; Di&s;honourable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion,
and &s;hews you very negligent of the Safety of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and of our Prote&s;tant Neighbours.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;VIII. Ordering immediate Hearings to trifling Petiti|ers,
to plea&s;e Parties in Elections; and <HI>Postpone</HI> the Pe|tition
of a Widow for the Blood of her Murthered
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Daughter, without giving it a reading; is an Illegal
delay of Ju&s;tice, di&s;honourable to the Publick Ju&s;tice of
the Nation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;IX. Addre&s;&s;ing the King to di&s;place His Friends up|on
bare Surmi&s;es, before any Legal Tryal or Article
prov'd; is Illegal, an Inverting the Law, and making
Execution go before Judgment; contrary to the true
&s;en&s;e of the Law, which e&s;teems every Man a good Man
till &s;omething appears to the contrary.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;X. Delaying proceedings upon Capital Impeachments,
to bla&s;t the Reputation of the Per&s;ons, without pro|ving
the Fact; is Illegal and Oppre&s;&s;ive, De&s;tructive of
the Liberty of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> a delay of Ju&s;tice, and a
reproach to Parliaments.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;XI. Suffering Sawey and indecent Reproaches upon
His Maje&s;ties Per&s;on, to be publickly made in your
Hou&s;e; particularly by that Impudent Scandal of Par|liaments
<HI>J&mdash;n H&mdash;w,</HI> without &s;hewing &s;uch re&s;ent|ments
as your ought to do. The &s;aid <HI>H&mdash;w</HI> &s;aying
openly, <HI>That His Maje&s;ty had made a Felonious Trea|ty
to Rob his Neighbours; in&s;inuating that the Partition
Treaty</HI> (which was every way as ju&s;t as blowing up
one Man's Hou&s;e to &s;ave another) <HI>was a Combina|tion
of the King to Rob the Crown of</HI> Spain <HI>of its due;</HI>
This is making a <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> of the Hou&s;e, and &s;et|ting
up to <HI>Bully</HI> your Soveraign, contrary to the in|tent
and meaning of that freedom of Speech which you
claim as a Right, is &s;candalous to Parliaments, Undu|tiful
and Unmannerly, and a Reproach to the whole
Nation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;XII. Your S&mdash;r Exacting the Exorbitant rate of
10 <HI>l. per Diem</HI> for the V&mdash;s, and giving the Printer in|couragement
to rai&s;e it on the People, by &s;elling them
at <HI>4d. per</HI> Sheet; is an Illegal, and Arbitrary exaction,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
di&s;honourable to the Hou&s;e, and burthen&s;ome to the
People.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;XIII. Neglecting &s;till to pay the Nation's Debts
Compounding for Intere&s;t, and <HI>Postponing</HI> Petitions; is
Illega&s;, Di&s;honourable, and de&s;tructive of the Publick
Faith.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;XIV. Publickly neglecting the great Work of Re|formation
of Manners; though often pre&s;'d to it by the
King; to the great di&s;honour of God, and encourage|ment
of Vice, is a neglect of your Duty, and an abu&s;e
of the Tru&s;t repos'd in you, by God, His Maje&s;ty and
the People.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;XV. Being Scandalou&s;ly Vitious your &s;elves, both in
your Morals, and Religion; Lewd in Life, and Erroneous
in Doctrine, having publick Bla&s;phemers and Impudent
denyers of the Divinity of our Saviour, among you, and
&s;uffering them unreproved and unpuni&s;hed, to the infi|nite
regret of all good Chri&s;tians, and the Ju&s;t abhor|rence
of the whole Nation.&endq;</P>
<P>The be&s;t Shift that ever was found yet to help you
was by Sir <HI>Humphrey Mackworth,</HI> that you are not to be
told your Faults, altho they are true.</P>
<Q>Forbid it Heaven that Truth &s;hou'd ever be
Subjected to &V;&s;urp'd Authority.</Q>
<P>And are you the Men who want to be Cho&s;en again,
who think you de&s;erve &s;o much favour from the Na|tion,
as to be tru&s;ted again with tho&s;e Liberties you
betray'd? With what Face can you de&s;ire the People
&s;hou'd be &s;o blind to their own Intere&s;t?</P>
<P>What we have now to &s;ay, was true of you &s;ome time
ago, but you had &s;o fenc'd your &s;elves by your U&s;urp'd
unlimited di&s;pen&s;ing Power, and by Sir <HI>Hump. Machworth</HI>'s
<PB N="9" REF="8">
new Doctrine, that an Hone&s;t Man could not inform
the World what you were, without the Danger of be|ing
abus'd by your Sergeant, and being refus'd the benefit
of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, and confin'd in a Garre$,
during the Arbitrary Plea&s;ure of your Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;ince you are Di&s;&s;olv'd, and now reduc'd to an
Equality with your Fellow Subjects, we think the lea&s;t
we can do, is to let you know, the Free-holders of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
are &s;en&s;ible of your Behaviour, and tho&s;e who are
not, may be inform'd from the following Particulars.</P>
<P>You are the Men who &s;itting in the Leates of Coun|cil,
repre&s;enting the good People of <HI>England,</HI> ve&s;ted
with Legi&s;lative Authority, and having the Liberties
and E&s;tates of your Native Country put into your
Hands, mi&s;-improv'd that unlimited Power to oppre&s;s the
very People who cho&s;e you to defend them.</P>
<P>By unju&s;tly lmpri&s;oning the Free-holders of <HI>England,</HI>
for coming to put you in mind of your Duty, and op|pre&s;&s;ing
&s;uch as you had no power to Touch, they being
under the immediate protection of the known Laws.</P>
<P>By partial proceedings again&s;t &s;uch Per&s;ons as the
prevailing Party thought fit to expel, as guilty of
Bribery, Wi&s;ely, tho' Unju&s;tly declining the Proceedings
again&s;t others more Guilty, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance to do Evil
you wanted in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>By not refu&s;ing to Declare War without Ground,
for no Body de&s;ir'd it, but Delaying the Publick Affairs,
till the Enemy was at the Door. <HI>Flanders</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t, <HI>Por|tugal</HI>
di&s;courag'd and fallen off, the <HI>Dutch</HI> be&s;ieg'd, and
His Maje&s;ty oblig'd to turn Sollicitor, and to your
Shame be it &s;poken, permitted almo&s;t to beg you to
make good the Leagues and Stipulations of his Pre|dece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>By Impeaching Members of the Hou&s;e of Lords, and
&s;huffling off their Tryal, by mi&s;erable Shifts, and ridi|culous
Punctilioes; the end being to bla&s;t their Repu|tation,
not prove the Fact, that they might be put
out of Places, and your &s;elves put in.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
By Quarrelling with the Hou&s;e of Lords, at a time
when Peace at home was the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary thing in
the World, at the &s;ame time the Circum&s;tances being
Unju&s;t, and the Management ridiculous.</P>
<P>You are the Men, who &s;ince the la&s;t rece&s;s have
&s;cattered your &s;elves about the Kingdom, to make your
&s;elves Advocates for your own Proceedings, and if
po&s;&s;ible to reconcile the People to your Actions, and
po&s;&s;e&s;s them with a Belief of your Hone&s;ty; a certain
&s;ign your Deeds would not &s;peak for them&s;elves, who
in all your fooli&s;h Di&s;cour&s;es take upon you to Vil|lifie
and Reproach the King, Expo&s;e his Servants
and Mini&s;ters, though your Accu&s;ation to this Hour
remain unprov'd.</P>
<P>Who &s;o far from giving the People any hopes that
you wou'd recollect your &s;elves again&s;t another Se&s;&s;ion,
and proceed to di&s;charge your Duty, and the Tru&s;t
repo&s;'d in you with more Fidelity and Moderation, have
fill'd the Town with your Threatnings of what you
wou'd do at your coming together again.</P>
<P>How you wou'd begin where you left off with your
Di&s;putes again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Lords?</P>
<P>How you wou'd make the King agree to clip the
Wings of their Authority, or give him no Money?</P>
<P>How you wou'd enter upon no Bu&s;ine&s;s till you had hum|bled
the Lords, that if they in&s;i&s;ted on their Priviledges,
the blame of the Delays might lie upon them, and &s;o
find a way at one Act to throw your &s;pleen at the Peers,
and at the King together?</P>
<P>You are the Men to whom we owe the many Neu|trallities
of the Princes, and Circles of the Empire, and
<HI>Italy,</HI> the League of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> with the <HI>French,</HI> and
the <HI>French</HI> King's venturing to acknowledge another
King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas the Fears of your being Corrupted by a <HI>French</HI>
$word$, made our Friends abroad &s;hy of Engaging in the
Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; and the hopes of it has on the other
<PB N="11" REF="10">
hand encourag'd the <HI>French</HI> to in&s;ult the Chri&s;tian
World, and bid faid for all the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas a Creature of your Speakers, and a fawning
Dependant upon the Party, who &s;cribling for Favour,
had the Impudence to affirm in Print, <HI>That leagues
and Confederacies, Allies and Foreign Treaties were u&s;ele&s;s
and in&s;ignificant to</HI> England; <HI>that we were an I&s;tant &s;e|perated
from the re&s;t of the World independant of any Body;
And if all the World Leagu'd again&s;t us, if we were true to
our &s;elves we need not care. As to our Trade, our Manu|factures
had the Command of the World, and wou'd force
their way, and our Fleet could protect, and continue our
Trade in &s;pight of all Mankind; and that the concern we
had in the &s;afety of our Neighbours, was only pretence to rai&s;e
Armies to En&s;lave us at home.</HI></P>
<P>You are the Men that have acted, as if ye believ'd
this prepo&s;terous Doctrine, endeavouring to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
People with Fears and Jealou&s;ies of Slavery at home,
under the Protection and Government of the only King
in the World, that ever &s;incerely &s;ought, and effectually
re&s;tor'd our Freedom.</P>
<P>But that we may do Ju&s;tice al&s;o to tho&s;e Gentlemen,
who to their utmo&s;t oppos'd all your Treacherous
proceedings before we come more freely to tell you our
Minds: We mu&s;t plainly mark you out, that the In|nocent
may not &s;uffer with the Guilty.</P>
<P>I. Such of you (for &s;uch as the&s;e were among you)
who having been purchas'd <HI>in former Reigns</HI> by Court-Pen&s;ions,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t Arbitrary Princes, joyn'd with them
to En&s;lave us; &s;elling the Liberties of your Country
to Gratifie the Lu&s;t of Dominion, and the Projects of
<HI>Popi&s;h Councils.</HI></P>
<P>II. Such of you (who being Poy&s;on'd with Arbitra|ry
Principles) gave your Con&s;ents to &s;ubmit all our
Laws and Charters to a di&s;pen&s;ing Authority in the
Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
III. Such of you as having forgot that the Original
of all Right is deriv'd from, and re&s;ted in the People,
had Complimented your Native Country out of her
Priviledges, and Elevated our Kings with a Divine right
of Government, which neither God, Nature, or the
People ever gave them.</P>
<P>IV. Such who having thus been the Tools of Ty|ranny
in former Reigns, have &s;till deluded the Credu|lity
of the People, and by great Intere&s;ts in &s;mall
Burroughs, have obtain'd again to be tru&s;ted in Parlia|ment
with the People's Safety.</P>
<P>V. Such of you who having no E&s;tate, nor able to
pay your own Debts, &s;hould put &s;uch a Banter upon
the People, as to de&s;ire to be Examiners of the Na|tions
Accounts without a Sallary; as if we did not
know that if the Nation did not pay them, &s;ome body
el&s;e mu&s;t.</P>
<P>VI. Such of you who brib'd by Foreign Hopes, and
<HI>French</HI> Money, expect to make your Fortunes at the
Expence of the Nation.</P>
<P>VII. Such as are blindly led by the Party, who pur|&s;ue
the&s;e Devili&s;h De&s;igns, whereas they are tru&s;ted
by their Country not to act by the Directions of others,
but ought either to be capable of Judging, and Acting
for the People that cho&s;e them, or be &s;ent home in
Hanging Sleeves, and a Slaberring-Bib.</P>
<P>VIII. Such of you as &s;hou'd ha' been Hang'd at the
Revolution for your formerly betraying your Coun|try,
and are now like a true Thief, &s;triving to Cut their
Throats who &s;av'd you from the Gallows.</P>
<P>IX. Such of you who cry out of the People of 41, for
rai&s;ing War again&s;t, and depo&s;ing their Soveraign, but are
<PB N="13" REF="12">
ju&s;t 60 Years after going in the &s;ame Steps, and had
you the &s;ame Prince to do with, wou'd before now
ha' brought it to the Sword.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Men which makes the People of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
give Thanks to God and the King, that has freed
them form the Ruin de&s;ign'd for them by their own
Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>'Tis for your Sakes that is come to pa&s;s in <HI>England,</HI>
which never was heard of before, that the People
&s;hould have recour&s;e to the <HI>King</HI> to &s;ave them from be|ing
undone by the <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>What means all the Language of the Addre&s;&s;es which
Croud from the extreme&s;t part of the Nation? That
when ever it &s;hall plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty to call a New Par|liament,
they will endeavour to chu&s;e <HI>&s;uch and &s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>Had you not been a Parliament in being, and your
unrea&s;onable and wrong Extended power formidable,
'tis pre&s;um'd the Language of tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es would
have been for God &s;ake, and for the Nation's &s;ake, to
be&s;eech His Maje&s;ty to call a New Parliament, and to
promi&s;e to choo&s;e Hone&s;ter Men than they did before.</P>
<P>As for all tho&s;e hone&s;t Gentlemen who had the mi&s;|fortune
to be over-power'd by your Numbers, to be
huff'd, ralli'd, and Bear-beated by the Clamours and
Noi&s;e of the Multitude; but &s;till to their power, op|po&s;ed
your Wicked De&s;igns, and Di&s;charg'd their Du|ty
to their Country.</P>
<P>The Grateful remembrance of their Fidelity will re|main
in the Hearts of every Hone&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and be

who come to Te&s;tify their Re&s;entment of the
Affront put upon Your Maje&s;ty by the <HI>French</HI> King,
in acknowledging the Titles of Your Maje&s;ties King|doms
to a contemptible Impo&s;tor, and to make ten|der
of their Humble Duty to Your Maje&s;ty, We Be|&s;eech
your Maje&s;ty to permit the Humble Addre&s;s of not

<P>We humbly approach Your Maje&s;ty in the Names

<HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t, and &s;eek the Pro&s;perity of their

Your Maje&s;ty that the Hearts of the whole Nation
are here repre&s;ented. Such Excepted as will be here|after

<P>We had come to Your Maje&s;ty with our Humble

Your Maje&s;ty having been always &s;o ready to Redre&s;s
the Grievances of your People in a Parliamentary

<P>We cannot but repre&s;ent to Your Maje&s;ty, and

having with more freedom then they approv'd of,
been told the Illegality of their Proceedings, and
Charg'd with the Facts wherein they acted con|trary
to the Sence and Intere&s;t of the People they
repre&s;ented &s;hou'd in&s;tead of rectifying or an&s;wering

be po&s;&s;ible Your People of <HI>England</HI> cou'd entertain
any Thoughts to the prejudice of Your Maje&s;ty, who
are &s;o ju&s;tly dear to them.</P>
<P>And whereas the Pro&s;perity of this Nation depends
upon the &V;nanimous Conjunction both of Hearts,

our Sorrow, and Di&s;appointment that it &s;hou'd ever

<P>'Tis not without a ju&s;t concern We have for &s;ome

<P>Your Maje&s;ty has &s;ufficiently Expre&s;t in all the Actions of

Gentlemen of that Hou&s;e have been Deluded, and Blindly
led under &s;pecious Pretences of Liberty, to Embroil us in Civil
Heats and Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty (more than any of your late Predece&s;&s;ors)
has appear'd fully &s;ati&s;y'd with the con&s;tant Affections of your

<P>Nor can We forget to give your Maje&s;ty our mo&s;t humble

<P>And becau&s;e it may &s;eem a new thing in <HI>England,</HI> for the
People to thank their King for di&s;&s;olving the Parliament.
We humbly crave leave to a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that nothing

&s;ecure the Peace and Tranquillity of Europe, reduce the Ex|orbitant
Power of our Enemies, compleat your Maje&s;ties Ju&s;t and

<P>And We further humbly a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that if ever
