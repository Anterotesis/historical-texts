<HEAD>The PREFACE To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AS</HI> the <HI>Faults on Both Sides</HI> have given a gene|ral Satisfaction to Impartial Men, and &s;uch as wish well to their Native Country; &s;o I doubt not but the Method which is taken in this Treati&s;e, will be as Acceptable: The <HI>Author</HI> has no De&s;ign but to lay the Faults where they ought to be, and Hone&s;tly to shew which of the Contending Parties are the be&s;t Friends to our <HI>Con&s;titution</HI>, and are <HI>like to prove the be&s;t Subjects</HI> to Her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reader</HI> will here find a True and Compleat HI|STORY of the Proceedings of <HI>a Party</HI> ever-&s;ince the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and may &s;ee how far the late <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> were in the Right, in their Proceedings a|gain&s;t Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>. I shall not pay much time in Prefacing, but rather refer the <HI>Reader</HI> to the Book it &s;elf; which, I doubt not, if he be an Impartial One, will give him &s;atisfaction, by shewing him what Methods have been taken <HI>by a Party of Men</HI> among&s;t Us, to <HI>Ruin our Con&s;titution:</HI> And how far it may be Con|venient to Tru&s;t Them again.</P>

<HEAD>THE States-Man out of Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE World has been told, That the <HI>Whiggs</HI> are very much Baulk'd, hand|&s;omely Banter'd, and wittily Expos'd, in a late Book, Entituled, <HI>Sir Thomas Double at Court</HI>, &amp;c. The fir&s;t Je&s;t in the Account is, <HI>That Nobody ever told them &s;o but the</HI> Author; and mo&s;t Men that have Charity for the Author, &s;ay, <HI>When he told us &s;o, he did not believe it him&s;elf</HI>.</P>
<P>Two Gentlemen meeting over a Bottle, and reading this Book, found the Ma|lice run &s;o high, and the Wit run &s;o low, that it mov'd them to enter a little into Di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ame Subjects. The Amu&s;ement and Sugge&s;tions, which, tho' unprov'd in the lea&s;t, the Author would have call'd Satyr, were &s;o gro&s;s, that at fir&s;t they began to be &s;urfei$ed with the Thoughts of running through the whole Rap&s;ody; but recollecting them&s;elves, they concluded that they would enter by way of Conference upon the &s;ubject of the late management and turns in the State, and perhaps, by Di&s;cour&s;ing the&s;e things freely, in which they were both through|ly ver&s;t by their long experience, they might better clear up to one another the true &s;tate of our Ca&s;e in this Nation, and expo&s;e the Malicious Sugge&s;tions of the pretended Dialogues, than by entring into a party, or by taking any of the Redi|culous Schemes, mention'd therein, to pieces by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We &s;hall bring our Two Gentlemen to &s;peak directly to Things, without &s;pen|ding Eleven or Twelve Pages about Introductions to Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;aying &s;ome|thing or other which &s;ignifies nothing, of their Grand-Fathers, their Great E&s;tates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Cou&s;in <HI>Turn-Round</HI>, How do you do? I am very glad to &s;ee you&punc; I find you are a Brother of Affliction, I hear you are out too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It's very true, I had my di&s;mi&s;s this Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It's the more &s;urprizing to the Town, becau&s;e we all kn$w you were come into the New Court Mea&s;ures: Indeed it is not &s;trange to me; for I always believed you had Turn'd again&s;t your &s;edate&s;t Thoughts, and that, when your Judg|ment return'd upon you, it would bring you round again to your old Hone&s;t Par|ty, who you were at fir&s;t &s;o Zealous for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I did at fir&s;t go in with them they made their Pre$$nces &s;o &s;pe|cious, and talk'd &s;o &s;e$mingly &s;incerely, that I really thought they would Act like Men of Temper and Moderation, and that they only &s;ought to rectify &s;ome exhor|bitances, which, indeed, I was as unea&s;ie at as other People: But now, I think I find what they drive at; that the old Game is to be Reviv'd; that the Q&mdash;&mdash;n is but to Change her Rulers, as they call 'em, not at all to be more at Liberty, and I doubt in the end, &s;he will be either Abandon'd or given Up: And th$&s;e things have opened my Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad your Eyes are open; and I doubt not but in time, the Eyes of all the People in <HI>England</HI>, a few who are wilfully blind only excepted, will be open'd, and when this Illumination happens, the&s;e People will have rea&s;on to look about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I hope you will u&s;e me gently, I have been a <HI>Tory</HI> but a little while, I may live to attone for the Excur&s;ion, by expo&s;ing the Villainous part I &s;ee they are acting, for a fair Warning to others, that they be not deluded or &s;educed, Penitents are always an Advantage to the Church, and &s;hould be receiv'd kindly, you know <HI>there is more Joy in Heaven</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are to be the more valued, becau&s;e you come off from them upon meer Conviction, when you might have made your Fortune with them; you can have no motives to come Round to us, ju&s;t now; we have no Places to give, no Honours to confer, no Encouragements for a Fal&s;e Brother among them to betray them to us; yours mu&s;t be the meer &s;trength of Rea&s;on and Conviction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly I am not &s;tuddying my Intere&s;ts in it, that's Confe&s;t; but to tell you the truth, I &s;ee &s;o much Mi&s;chief in their De&s;ign, &s;o much Tricking, Sharping and Cheating in their Methods, and &s;uch &s;haring the Spoil before they have gotten the Victory; that it fill$d me with an Aver&s;ion to the ba&s;ene&s;s of the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt you might have had your Share among them too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They have not been wanting to make me very good Offers, be&s;ides what I enjoy'd among them before; but it would not do: I mu&s;t own I look'd upon my &s;elf as a Traytor to my Country, all that little while I was among them, that was &s;elling Her to the Enemy, only to get a little &s;hare in the Purcha&s;e Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I make no que&s;tion they have made you good Offers, and are doubtle&s;s at a great lo&s;s for want of you: I know they valued them&s;elves mightily upon you when they began to make their new appearance; They knew the Intere&s;t you have in your Country was great, and however, perhaps, they might let you into as few of their Secrets as they cou'd, being willing not to &s;hock that Principle they knew well e|nough you acted from, yet they knew how fatal it wou'd one time or other be to have you again&s;t them; therefore I do not wonder, that they endeavour'd all they could to engage you to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Truely they took &s;ome low &s;teps that way, and &s;uch as I thought they would hardly have &s;toop'd to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot conceive what they could offer you; for as you po&s;&s;e&s;t already one of the be&s;t Po&s;ts in the Kingdom, it was not in their Power to do much more for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are greatly Mi&s;taken, there are new Methods of making a Man's Fortun$ be&s;ides Places; but I am not about to turn Evidence again&s;t them, let them alone they will entangle them&s;elves when they get a little further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I ask your Pardon, I was not &s;ifting, nor am I curio$s to look into the Se|cret part of this new Management; I have &s;een &s;o much of the Introduction, that I need not look into the $e&s;t of the Book: But one thing you may give me leave to ask of you, Pray, How did you come to &s;hew your Alienation to them? tho' if there be any &s;ecret in it, pray pardon the Que&s;tion, and leave me without an An|&s;wer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No Secret in it at all, I'll be as plain in my An&s;wer to you, as <HI>I</HI> was in the Thing it &s;elf to them; When fir&s;t they propos'd to me the changing Hands; I confe&s;s the Pretences were plau&s;ible, and I readily enough came in to them; I had &s;een &s;ome People Unea&s;ie, the Mini&s;try, we thought, engro&s;s'd the Management too much; treated all that attempted to act upon the lea&s;t differing point from them, with too much &s;everity; &s;har'd with too much eagerne&s;s and app$$ite, the Profits of Pla|ces,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
and the Preferments of the Nation. I had been formerly concern'd, when tho&s;e we call'd the Juncto or <HI>Whig</HI> Lords, were of the &s;ame Opinion, and found the Mini|&s;try were &s;atisfy'd the Pretence was &s;o Ju&s;t, that they opened to them and took them in; but I found &s;till this Opening took in but a few; who being as it were, &s;atis|fy'd for them&s;elves, abandoned the Popular Part of their Preten&s;ions, and left their Friends to &s;hift: The&s;e and &s;ome other Con&s;iderations, which I &s;hall hint at by and by, made me think a Change was not in the lea&s;t Inconvenient, and far from being Dangerous; and this enclin'd me to Joyn: <HI>But then</HI>, you are to take it with you as we go, this Inclination was always encourag'd and &s;upported by their con&s;tant Declarations of &s;etting up a Moderate Management, a middle way, by which the fears and apprehen&s;ions of the Nation &s;hould be Removed; That they would &s;ingle out the Men of Temper and Judgment, without Di&s;tinction of Parties; That the be&s;t Men of every Party &s;hould be employ'd; That the hot ungovern'd Spirits that had &s;o near ruin'd us before &s;hould not appear again, or meet with the lea&s;t coun|tenance; That the Queen being left Perfectly free, and unbe&s;ieg'd by Parties, would extend Her Favours were Merit recommended, without Re&s;pect to the Bya&s;s of this or that Intere&s;t; That none &s;hould be brought in but what would give A&s;&s;urances of acting with a perfect indifferency to all Parties, and Pur&s;ue the Publick Service with all po&s;&s;ible Moderation.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Amu&s;ements by which I was drawn in to joyn with the Party, and particularly in the fir&s;t Removes that were made; and I cannot deny but my ac|quie&s;cing might encourage them to think their Game &s;ure, and from that Confidence to thro' off the Mask &s;ooner than they otherwi&s;e would have done: for the Integri|ty of Mens De&s;igns is always di&s;cover'd when they fancy them&s;elves pa&s;t Danger of a Di&s;a&s;ter in the making them Publick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Account of the&s;e things is &s;urprizing, and the more &s;o, when you accknowledge you believ'd them: Did ever One Man but you believe they could act Moderately in any thing? It may be in their Politicks to contrive a Moderate Ma|nagement, and I believe &mdash; who governs them in the Schemes of th$&s;e things might propo&s;e it; for he knows no other Method can draw in the Nation: But it is no more in their Power than it is to pull the Stars out of Heaven! A <HI>Tory</HI> can no more be a Moderate Manager, than the Elements can cea&s;e to put forth their com|pleat Vigour when left to Nature and freed from Con&s;traint. Every thing in Na|ture acts its utmo&s;t Power: Fire cannot Burn moderately, or Water Flow mode|rately, neither can a <HI>Tory</HI> Govern moderately; he may pretend to what he will, but it is not in his Nature: His Blood Boyls too Hot; his Circulations are too Rapi$&punc; in Religion he mu&s;t Per&s;ecute, in Government he mu&s;t Oppre&s;s, in Office he mu&s;t In&s;ult; in Power he mu&s;t Plunder and De&s;troy; 'tis the Nature of a High <HI>Tory</HI>, and it cannot be otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I was formerly of that Opinion, and begin to be &s;o again; but the Prote&s;tations of this Party were &s;uch as would have Deceived <HI>the very Elect</HI>, and I was the ea&s;ier brought to be Credulous in this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e &s;ome of them were the very Men, that to my Knowlege, were formerly the In&s;truments to De|po&s;e the Ra&s;h Party we now call <HI>High Men</HI>, when they had the publick Affairs in their Hands, and turn'd them out with all imaginable Contempt, as Men that were pu&s;hing us upon Rocks and Precipices, and that by the Fire of their Party would De&s;troy us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and when did you come to eclairici&s;ment in this Affair? for I find you di&s;cover'd them very early, con&s;idering you as one that did not &s;u&s;pect them&punc; for me, indeed, I always believ'd them what we all find them to be, and therefore it is no wonder to find me, and &s;uch as I am, before you in our Mea&s;ures: But for
<PB N="6" REF="6">
you that were per&s;waded of their Sincerity, it is very &s;trange, and no le&s;s happy, that you should &s;ee into them &s;o &s;oon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they had no &s;ooner &s;truck the Blow, but like <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> when he pa&s;t the <HI>Rubican</HI>, they threw off the Mask, and as he di&s;cover'd plainly that he aim'd at the Empire, &s;o I thought they di&s;cover'd them&s;elves to be inclining for a High Ma|nagement, AS SUCH, that they were already link'd in with the whole Party, that <HI>One</HI> and <HI>All</HI> was the Word among them, and they had re&s;olv'd to borrow an Old Party Motto in their Dealings with the <HI>Whiggs, (viz.) Root</HI> and <HI>Branch</HI>: In pur|&s;uance of this their Genuine De&s;ign, the void Places were immediately fill'd, as fa&s;t as they could clear the way, with the very Men they had prote&s;ted again&s;t by Name, &s;uch as <HI>B. S.</HI> and <HI>R. S. S. J.</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Then it was I took the freedom to expo&s;tulate with them in plain Terms, and told them, This was not agreeable to the Schemes propo&s;ed; That they were not going the way to a Moderate Management; That this was putting all things into the Hands of the High Party. That this Party were the declared Enemies of the Settle|ment, and had openly <HI>wa&s;h'd their Hands of the Revolution</HI>: I told them plainly I mu&s;t leave them, and every Man that wi&s;h'd well to the Nation mu&s;t leave them; That this was to bring the profe&s;s'd Enemies of the Revolution upon us, and on pre|tence of delivering us from the Influence of one Party, this was delivering us up to a|nother Party, of who&s;e Temper and Prudence the Nation had already had too much Experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This was very Plain and Hone&s;t; Pray, How did they bear it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They bore it calmly; for I expre&s;s'd my &s;elf with Re&s;pect: But they told me for An&s;wer, That the&s;e Men had born their &s;hare in the Oppo&s;ition of the Mini&s;try, and had &s;tood fa&s;t to them in bringing the New Change to pa&s;s; that they could not Abandon them entirely, but would bring as few of them in as po&s;&s;ible; and tho&s;e that were brought in had given their Words to act with a differing Spirit, and to put on all the Temper and Calmne&s;s imaginable, e&s;pecially while the other Party carry'd it with any Common Re&s;pect. I told them, I was &s;orry to &s;ee they &s;hould go from their mo&s;t &s;olemn&punc; and early Engagements, and that for the Paroll tho&s;e People had given, I had a very mean Opinion of it, from experience I had of their antient Conduct; and that I expected nothing could Succeed in their Hands after &s;uch a &s;tep as this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In this you acted with a great deal of Candour and Hone&s;ty, and I make no doubt, but this plainne&s;s rendred you unea&s;ie to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I never &s;par'd them upon all Occa&s;ions, and being &s;o con&s;tant in the&s;e Expo&s;tulations, <HI>I</HI> found they quickly grew unea&s;ie; I &s;hewed always as much Un|ea&s;ine&s;s as they, and told them often, I &s;hould be thankful to them, if they would plea&s;e to give me the <HI>Coup de Grace</HI> and let me go; which at la&s;t they have done, and now I come among my Friends again. The little time <HI>I</HI> have been ab&s;ent, has let me into the Secrets of the Society, and <HI>I</HI> regret the Time <HI>I</HI> have lo&s;t among them very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are very well come to your &s;elf again <HI>I</HI> doubt not, and <HI>I</HI> am &s;ure you are &s;o to your Friends; for <HI>I</HI> know no Man among them, we regretted the lo&s;s of to much as of your &s;elf.</P>

<P>But methinks <HI>I</HI> look like a Turn-Coat, like a Renega$o, my Cloaths &s;mells of the Sulphur, and the Language &s;ounds &s;till in my Ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> confe&s;s <HI>I</HI> have an Aver&s;ion to Turning of all kinds; but of all tho&s;e that Turn, they only are happy who turn <HI>Quite Round</HI>; for, tho' at fir&s;t they may be a little deluded, when they come to be illuminated, and to &s;ee the Mi&s;take, they Turn on, and come about where they began. Such always embrace the Truth with more Con&s;tancy and Steddyne&s;s than other People, and <HI>I</HI> doubt not you will do &s;o too, and therefore <HI>I</HI> Congratulate our Intere&s;t upon your Return.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There are many more will take the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, or <HI>I</HI> am very much mi&s;taken; for <HI>I</HI> am very well &s;atisfy'd, they are at this time made up of &s;uch a Mix|ture, that they cannot go on far together: Nay, <HI>I</HI> am verily per&s;uaded, that even Mr. &mdash; him&s;elf, cannot go the Length, that the&s;e People expect from him, but that in a little while you will &s;ee, that either they will break off from Him, or He from Them.</P>

<P><HI>I</HI> have not a good Opinion in the lea&s;t of the Mea&s;ures he is now taking, but <HI>I</HI> own I have not &s;uch Thoughts of him in the main as others have; <HI>I</HI> am very de&s;irous to believe, that however he may act in the Dark at pre&s;ent, he has not the Pretender in his View, he cannot have the Subver&s;ion of the Con&s;titution in his De|&s;ign: <HI>I</HI> think &s;o, you will excu&s;e my Charity.</P>

<P>For my part <HI>I</HI> differ from you extremely; <HI>I</HI> neither like the Mea&s;ures $e is now taking, or the Mea&s;ures he ever took: <HI>He is no Kin to me: I</HI> thank God, <HI>I</HI> am of the Family of the <HI>Steddy's</HI>, and <HI>I</HI> think he is not the lea&s;t Related to us.</P>

<P><HI>I know not whether be may be of your Branch&punc; but I think he $s</HI> Steddy <HI>too, and that in particular to his own Interest; I am per&s;waded this is what he is chiefly pur&s;uing: He would have pur&s;u'd his Interest and our Cau&s;e together but you threw him off, and he went away to tho&s;e People; and I am per&s;waded he is only &s;erving his Interest of them, and they under&s;tand him &s;o, for they are &s;erving their Interest of him: You will &s;ee this in the Con&s;equence; as &s;oon as ever the&s;e Interests are &s;erved either on one Hand or other, you will find the$'ll break, and then we &s;hall have him again</HI>.</P>

<P><HI>Nay, there you must pardon me for &s;aying you are in the Wrong; I wi&s;h he were as heartily with us again, as he was once, I &s;hould think it a good &s;tep to throw out all this</HI> Tory <HI>Management again, and re&s;tore us all to our Primitive State</HI>.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have not given &s;o many Proofs of Un&s;teddine&s;s, as I think he has done, nor can you have the &s;ame Pro&s;pects: Do you remember when he was with us, how near he was to have &s;upplanted the Mini&s;try, and delivered us to the $word$ Party he has now brought in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn-Round.</SPEAKER>

<P>Had <HI>Dr. Double</HI> known any thing of the Hi&s;tory of that time, he would have known, that the&s;e were the Men who delay'd the Treaty with <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>, when he had made a kind of propo&s;al to come in; and got a Traytor to be &s;ent over to him, on pretence of making the Treaty, who fir&s;t encouraged him to go back from his de|&s;igns, adhere to Arms and begin the War; and then went over to him&s;elf.

<P>Then they prepare an Army to go for <HI>Ireland</HI>, and put on a mighty face of Zeal for the Relief of <HI>London Derry</HI>; but with Indu&s;trious Delays, they kept every thing back &s;o long, that if po&s;&s;ible, that little handful of Valiant prote&s;tants might be devoured, and <HI>Ireland</HI> be wholly re&s;tored to King <HI>James</HI>&punc; And 'tis known who Curs'd the Cowardly Behaviour of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Generals, that could not take that P$ltry Town in &s;o long Time.

<P>This to the Great Mortification of the Party, put a &s;hort end to that work; yet the Tory Party took a great many &s;teps to retrieve Matters there, and to &s;pin out the War to that length, as might prevent the Kings applying him&s;elf to the Work in <HI>Flan|ders</HI>, which his Eye was principally intent upon; in Order to this, the fir&s;t Siege of <HI>Limeric</HI> was directly delay'd, till it was too late to expect the Reduction of a place &s;o &s;trong; and that Siege effectually broke, by betraying the &s;upply of Cannon and Am|munition <HI>which was coming to them</HI>, to <HI>Sar$field</HI> the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> General.</P>

<P>I left you at the end of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> War: That Affair being over, the King pu&s;h'd the War on in <HI>Flanders</HI> and that with more Vigour than our Party here wi&s;h'd him to go on with; and therefore to make every thing as difficult as po&s;&s;ible, they took off his Chariot Wheels at Home; in every Hou&s;e they Embarre&s;t his Affairs; the Taxes were given late; and Bills for Money hung long in Hand: So that tho' the Nation paid the Money, the late lingring Grants came &s;o, that the Campaigns were render'd fruitle&s;s. The Enemies were always in the Field before us; when we came there, we came Uncloath'd, Unpaid, with empty Magazines, and &s;ometimes without our Train; and thus the King, be&s;ides the Enemy, had the in&s;uperable Dif|ficulties of want of Nece&s;&s;aries to &s;truggle with; which Defeated his De&s;igns, Per|plext his Mind, and expos'd him to be frequently in&s;ulted by the Enemy.</P>

<P>All this while their Party fill'd the Town with Reproaches of the King of the Expence of the War, of carrying the Money out of the Nation; the Pa&s;qui|nades, the Lampoons, the Libels, again&s;t his Management and Conduct, were infi|nite, in order to render his Per&s;on Odious, and the War a Burth$n; and when at la&s;t, none of the&s;e would &s;erve their purpo&s;e, to Conquer the invincible Spirit of this Great Prince, they enter'd into the abhorr'd Project of Murther and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; When this Plot fir&s;t came to light, and the per&s;ons concern'd appear'd to the World, our High Church Men were exceeding bu&s;ie to throw it off from them&s;elves; they were loath to bring the <HI>French</HI> King in, becau&s;e he was their Friend; they would have hook'd the <HI>Papist</HI> in, but they, however aver&s;e to the Cour&s;e of that Princes Conque&s;ts, had pre&s;erv'd &s;o much regard to his per&s;on, that they could not, as a Bo|dy, be brought into &s;o Bloody and Di&s;honourable a Practice; &s;o the &s;candal of it lay wholly upon the <HI>Tories</HI>, even tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Church-men, and &s;peak loud for the Church of <HI>England</HI>: And when the Criminals, tho' owning the Fact, came to Die, they were Ab&s;olved by Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy-men, without owning it to be a Crime; and tho&s;e Clergy-men received no Cen&s;ure for it from the Re&s;t.</P>

<P>The Objections are trifles, That of Trade only concerns us, in which the&s;e People Quarrel that a Tarriff of Trade was not &s;ettled in the Treaty, but do not con&s;ider that it was our Intere&s;t to have no &s;ettlement of that Trade made at all; they would have had way made for our Woollen Manufactures into <HI>France</HI>, not con&s;idering, for, alas! they know nothing of the Matter, that then we mu&s;t have opened the Door to the Imports of Wine and Brandy, and Wrought Silks by ta|king off the high Duties from one, and the Prohibition from the other; which any Man, that knows any thing of Trade, in <HI>England</HI>, mu&s;t know would be our Ruine. I have heard a Great Man &s;ay, when the Que&s;tion was before the Hou&s;e, Whether the Trade with <HI>France</HI> &s;hould be open'd during the War, upon the Petition of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Merchants? That there was Danger, it might be Voted purely for the &s;ake of having Good Claret to Drink. That there are &s;ome Men who would not &s;cruple Wounding the General, to &s;ave the Particular, is too manife&s;t, but particularly in this Party; their other Objections again&s;t the Peace are needle&s;s to mention, and are in them&s;elves worth no Notice.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">It is evident they acted ba&s;ely, let it be which way it will; for if it was a &s;afe and good Peace, Why do they Reproach the King with it?

<P>But to whom was that Nece&s;&s;ity owing, was it not to our Party here, who then had the Cards in their Hands, and play'd to one anothers Hand? They amus'd the King &s;o long with Delays and Pretences, that his Maje&s;ty knew not, either how to keep the Peace with Honour, or how to begin the War with Safety; mean time the King of <HI>France</HI> pre&s;s'd the <HI>Dutch</HI>, block'd them up in their Frontier Towns, held their Regiments Pri&s;oners of War, which, by the Treachery of the Duke of <HI>Bava|ria</HI>, fell into his Hands, in the &s;everal Towns of <HI>Flanders</HI>, which that Duke put into the <HI>French</HI> Power all at once. The <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ent Expre&s;s after Expre&s;s, the King repre&s;ented their Ca&s;e to the Parliament, yet nothing moved. The &s;tipulated aid of Ten Thou&s;and Men, agreed by the Peace of <HI>Nimuguen</HI> to be lint to the <HI>Dutch</HI> when|ever the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould invade them, was delay'd, till at la&s;t an Expo&s;tulary Letter from the States being laid by the King before the Hou&s;e, brought on a kind of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for the &s;ending over that A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and thus we came &s;lowly on.</P>
<P>The&s;e things gave the whole Nation &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s, that they began to di&s;|cover it many ways; but one Intervening Accident alone effected their Illumina|tion, and effectually unhing'd our Tory Party, and broke all their Schemes, Hea|ven ju&s;t at this Juncture Summon'd King <HI>James</HI> out of the World, and the King of <HI>France</HI>, who by the late Treaty at <HI>Re&s;wick</HI>, had been oblig'd to acknowledge King <HI>William</HI>, and thereby reduc'd that unhappy Prince King <HI>James</HI>, to be quite hopele&s;s of Re&s;toration to his former Condition; the King of <HI>France</HI> finding by the additi|on of <HI>Spain</HI> his Affairs in a new Po&s;ture, and his Strength &s;o much to the Allies, that he &s;eem'd out of the reach of their Re&s;entments, he makes no difficulty of ac|knowledging the Pretender as King of all <HI>England, Scotland</HI>, and <HI>Ireland</HI>, in Breach of his former Conce&s;&s;ion, and in Direct contravention to the Treaty of <HI>Re&s;wick</HI>.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, broke all our Tory Mea&s;ures: They had till now kept the King at <HI>Bay</HI>, and kept off the Reproaches of a War; they had given the <HI>French</HI> Room and Time to act in &s;ettling the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy without any Op|po&s;ition, and rock'd the Nation A&s;leep as to tho&s;e things; but the whole King|dom now took the Alarm; the Affront to the King was &s;o gro&s;s, the Indignity was &s;o open, &s;o palpable a Violation of his Faith and Honour, and the Contempt of the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation was &s;o Great, and gave &s;o general a Di&s;gu&s;t, that no Tory had the face to open their Mouths again&s;t it: The Nation &s;eem'd rou&s;ed out of the Deep Sleep which the Managers had ca&s;t them into, and Addre&s;&s;es came from all parts of the Kingdom to his Maje&s;ty, expre&s;&s;ing their deep Re&s;entment of the Inju|ry done to his Maje&s;ty, and the Affront put upon the Kingdom; Humbly pre&s;&s;ing the King to declare War immediately again&s;t <HI>France</HI>, and promi&s;ing with Heart and Hand to A&s;&s;i&s;t him to the Utmo&s;t; This brought on the Di&s;&s;olution of that Parlia|ment, another being call'd in that happy juncture, the War was Declar'd, and thus the &s;econd Scene began.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty however &s;aw but little of it: He opened the Se&s;&s;ion with that Honou|rable &s;peech which Graces our Hou&s;es now, as the be&s;t Picture an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Heart can look on; and as the Parliament fell in heartily into the Work, Troops were Chearfully rais'd, and an Army appear'd &s;ooner than the Enemy expected; the Troops and Stores was at hand; the King hurt with his Fall from his Hor&s;e, fell ill, Langui&s;h'd a few days, and to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Lo&s;s of this Nation, Died March the 8th, 1701.</P>

<P>The nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this was a new Turn in the Mini&s;try; Her Maje&s;ty b$ing mo$'d by the goodne&s;s of her own inclination, always de&s;iring the Good, the Peace, and the &s;afety of her People, was oblig'd to let th$&s;e people know, that they had mi&s;taken her in &s;uppo&s;ing that when &s;he prompted their Zeal for the Church, they &s;hould think it con&s;i|&s;ted only in ex$irpating the Di&s;&s;enters; That Her Royal De&s;ign was both more Chri&s;tian, and more becoming a Chri&s;tian Queen, and a Nur&s;ing Mother of her People; that &s;he look'd upon the Peace and Union of all her Subjects with, and to $word$ $nother, the practice of Cha|rity, Good Neighbourhood, and forbearance in matters of Difference, to be the true way to &s;upport and maintain the Church; and that con&s;equently, tho&s;e that were <HI>mo&s;t Zealous</HI> for the Church of <HI>England</HI>, would one $$$ge and prom$$e to their utmo&s;t, a general Charity, and a Spirit of Union among all her People.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18">To undeceive them therefore in this thing, and further to explain the meaning of what had been &s;aid, Her Maje&s;ty declared upon all Occa&s;ions, that &s;he had at heart nothing more, than the Ea&s;e and Peace of all her Subjects; That &s;he would protect the Di&s;&s;enters in their peaceable and quiet behaviour, and would inviolably maintain the Toleration.</P>
<P>This indeed blew them all up, their Rage was equal to the &s;hortne&s;s of their Power: In&s;tead of going on with the furious attacks upon the Di&s;&s;enters as before, all was turn'd on a &s;udden again&s;t the Queen; Lampoons upon the Moderate Bi&s;hops; In&s;olent Invectives again&s;t the moderate Councils, that guided Her Maje&s;ty's Affairs; calling the Bi&s;hops Presbyterians; the Queen a De&s;erter of the Church, and all the moderate Gentlemen of the Church, betray|ers of their Mother and givers of her up to be Ravi&s;h'd and Butcher'd, by Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing.</P>
<P>This they carry'd to &s;uch a height of Extravagancy, that Her Maje&s;ty could not but re&s;ent it, and adhere$ng firmly to the profe&s;&s;ion &s;he had made of her Concern for the general Peace, and &s;eeing plainly what the&s;e people drove at, the nece&s;&s;ity of Dive&s;ting them of a power to put in practice the mi&s;chief they had apparently de&s;ign'd, appear'd inevitable; Thus they were Turn'd out of the Mini&s;try, and the Weapon of Admini&s;tration taken out of their Hands, as you take the Sword out of the hand of a mad-man, or knives from your Children, that they may neither do harm to other people, or to them&s;elves.</P>

<P>This is a very Di&s;tinct recital of the Fact indeed; but you mu&s;t give me leave to add &s;omething al&s;o that came within the Verge of my knowledge. As fir&s;t, that there was always a party among the&s;e people, who vi&s;ible, and indeed without any di&s;gui&s;e, aim'd at the pretender viz. That they &s;hould pretend to &s;ubmit to the Queen during her Life, and therefore as before, they came in and took the Oaths; but that after Her Maje&s;ty the preten|der was the undoubted Heir, and this they pu&s;h'd to that height, That her Maje&s;ty was fre|quently &s;til'd Tennant for Life, and that &s;he enjoy'd the Crown by way of Annuity. They had not the Face as I could ever hear, to propo&s;e it in Council; but it is not unknown to many, that they u&s;ually &s;aid, That to fini&s;h our peace, the pretender &s;hould be declar'd pro|te&s;tant, and that he &s;hould be acknowledg'd Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>This frightned many that had a true Zeal for Her Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, and Concern for her Safety, to think, that having reduc'd the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown to be only a tenant for life, they had then nothing to do, but to make the Le$&s;e as &s;hort as they could, and the whole Re|volution, with all its dependencies, &s;uch as Liberty, Law, prote&s;tant Religion, property of E|&s;tate, Toleration and the like, lay at the mercy of every a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inator; a &s;ort of people that par|ty hath never wanted, and which no Loyal Subject to Her Maje&s;ty, could think of without Horror.</P>

<P>I remember very well they bu$y'd them&s;elves up in the hopes to make it practicable from two things; Fir&s;t The Rupture, o$ at lea&s;t the probable failing of the Trea|ty of UNION with the Scots, which was all this while carry'd on, but without any great pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, together with the aver&s;ion the Scots had declar'd to &s;etling the Succe&s;&s;i|on with no; and Secondly, from the powerful Influence they thought their Friends had at Home.</P>

<P>This is mo&s;t evident in the Conduct of the Government here, after that Turn was given, $ot no &s;ooner was the Admini&s;tration gotten into Wi&s;er and hone&s;ter Hands, but they began with them, in their own way, to Defeat their Hopes from <HI>Scotland</HI>, and effe|ctually &s;ettle the Inheritants of the Crown in the prote&s;tant Line: Her Maje&s;ty recommended $ hearty and $ffectual Treaty of a Union with <HI>Scotland</HI>, and that not with the In&s;uperable Dif|ficulties of Uniting or Subjecting two Different Churches, and the Confu&s;ion of Re&s;erved Intere&s;ts; but a compleat entire Incorporation, and blending the Two Nations in an indi&s;&s;ol|vable Union, leaving their re&s;pective Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Con&s;titutions, Entire, Defended, Butted and Bounded, again&s;t any po&s;&s;ible Inva&s;ion of one another; and &s;ecured from any Po&s;&s;ibility

of either &s;ide encroaching upon the other, or of both &s;ides together, tho' by mutual agree|ment being able to &s;eparate.</P>
<P>This &s;et about Heartily, and Happily fini&s;hed, Naturally took the prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and has left it out of the reach of any Legal Power of the United Body to Repeal it.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep was to find out &s;ome method that the &s;imple taking the Oaths might not be a Screen to tho&s;e, who went upon the Notion of the Right of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Rever&s;ion which you mention'd ju&s;t now; and this was to E&s;tablish a Recognition of the Settlement of the Crown on the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI>, by abjuring the pretender.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e Two things form'd an E&s;&s;ential Security to the Life of the Queen; for now the Union being Settled, the pretender abjured, and the method of Declaring the Succe&s;&s;or al&s;o &s;ettled by the Act, appointing a Certain number of Lords to Admini&s;ter the publick Affairs, in Ca&s;e of the Queen's death, till the Succe&s;&s;or could come over, which Lords are oblidg'd and enjoyned on pain of High Trea&s;on, immediately to proclaim the Suc|ce&s;&s;or: The&s;e things have made the pretender's Cau&s;e &s;o exactly the &s;ame, whether the Queen Lives or Dies, that Her Maje&s;ty's Life is &s;ecured by this more effectually, than by Ten Thou&s;and Men to Guard Her per&s;on. (viz) That it will not be the lea&s;t advantage to them to de&s;troy Her, nay, Happy for her Maje&s;ty it is; Their Ca&s;e would appear the wor&s;e, &s;ince they would immediately have a powerful Martial Active prince, ready to pour in upon them in pro&s;&s;ecution of his Ju&s;t claim, in oppo&s;ing whom, perhaps they might not find the &s;ame Clemency, Tenderne&s;s, and Forbearance which they have, till now, pre&s;um'd upon,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a good Ob&s;ervation indeed, for I take her Maje&s;ty's Security, to lie much more in its not being for their Advantage to Hurt Her, than in all the Tyes of Honour, Unanimity, or Oaths in the world.</P>

<P>And therefore we find, that &s;ince this Union and Ab|juration, They have left off talking of the Queen's enjoying the Crown for Life, and the pretender's coming after Her; and with more Openne&s;s, (I might have &s;aid impudence) A&s;&s;ert the Right of the pretender to be Hereditary and indefeazable, and the Queen's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a meer Rob|bery and U&s;urpation. In pur&s;uance of this, we have &s;een him once at the Head of the French Army attempting to in&s;tate Him&s;elf, and invading Her Maje&s;ty's Dominions to Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Her by Force; and we are here|by in&s;tructed, in what the Queen has to expect from the party, if power &s;hould be put into their Hands to effect it.</P>

<P>It is but too plain that they would do it by Force rather than by any other Method, if it were in their power; and one Rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e if they come in by force, they have the better pretence to Rule by Arbitrary power, what they gain again&s;t our con&s;ents and we have the more Rea&s;on to be &s;teady in our Oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>Upon the Happy Succe&s;s of th$&s;e Moderate Councils, Her Maje&s;ty having quitted Her Hands of a Tricking De&s;igning Party, their Attempt in Parliament again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters having Mi&s;carry'd, and the Party expo&s;ed to the highe&s;t degree to the whole Nation, in their mo&s;t Weak, and Impollitick Attempt, call'd the TACK, Things began to look with a new Face both at Home and Abroad; Succe&s;&s;es one on the Neck of another. Victory Abroad; Ri&s;ing Credit at Home; the Happy Con|clu&s;ion of the Union; and the continu'd Declining of the <HI>French</HI> Affairs; took up the Time of near Four Succe&s;&s;ive Years: Every Year ended with Thanksgivings, Triumphs, Proce&s;&s;ions, <HI>Te Deums</HI> and Rejoycings of every kind: The Duke of MARL|BOROUGH has fill'd our Great Halls with Trophies, and our Magazines with the Spoils of the Enemies Armies. The World has been Amazed with the Surprizing Ac|counts; Armies entirely Overthrown, whole Countries Recover'd; Impregnable Cities Taken; He has never attack'd a Town, but he has taken it; never Fought a Battle, but he has Won it; Never undertaken any Negotiation, but he has accompli&s;h'd it: Our Trea&s;urer has produc'd Immen&s;e Summs; our Credit ri&s;en beyond what the World ever &s;aw, or any other Nation can pretend to; and <HI>France</HI>, Humbled by his many irrecovera|ble Lo&s;&s;es, has been brought the&s;e la&s;t Years upon Knees to Sollicite for Peace.</P>
<P>In doing this, he has Submitted to take Law from the Confederates in all Ca&s;es; He has &s;ent to the <HI>Hague</HI> to ask Peace of the <HI>Dutch</HI> at their own Doors. When he comes to a Second Treaty, He &s;ubmits to &s;end his Pl$nipotentiaries to a little Ob&s;cure Hole in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dominions, where they Treat, inviron'd by a Strong Garri&s;on, are not permitted to come a Foot nearer the <HI>Dutch</HI>; but when they have any thing to &s;ay, Me&s;&s;engers of a me$n Quality are &s;ent to fetch it like a Me&s;&s;age, and carry their An&s;wer, and when this proves not Satisfactory, they are &s;ent home, as if they had &s;aid, <HI>When you are further Humbled, Come again</HI>.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Treaties the Conce&s;&s;ion of <HI>France</HI> are Prodigious, and Greater than is likely to be obtain'd by Force in many Years War; even to the Demoli&s;hing of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>, that co&s;tly Work; the Quitting his Grand&s;on; and Con&s;tituting Money to a&s;&s;i&s;t us to Dethrone him: It were endle&s;s to recite all the Countries, Cities, and &s;trong Towns he offers to give up in a Peace.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steddy.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I am Steddy &s;till, and have no Opinion of that kind; however, let me go on: The first Breach which was made in the Mini&s;try, whether it sprung from his Ambition to overthrow others, or any ill U&s;age which is pretended, is not to the purpo&s;e; but this is certain, it has been a very unhappy Blow: From that time to this the Unity of Councils, the Peace of Parties, and the general Tranquility of the Nation have declin'd; we have been fill'd with Complaints of Management without Doors, and many bu&s;ie endeavours to make the People unea&s;ie; nor has things past without &s;ome Reciprocal Re&s;entments and Unkindne&s;&s;es within, and on both &s;ides: No want of Emi&s;&s;aries and Incendiaries to blow the Coals, to rai&s;e Feuds, keep up Animo&s;ities; and Influence Parties; things naturally Tending to a Breach, and to Interrupt the Felicity of this Nation, which had &s;o happily been our Lot for the past Years.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This is grown to &s;uch a Height, as we &s;ee at this Time, when the Mini&s;try that had ma|naged with &s;o much Succe&s;s, and had brought us to &s;uch happy Circum&s;tances, &s;eem to have lo&s;t the Favour of their Mi&s;tre&s;s; and private Di&s;a&s;ters falling in with Party Inte|re&s;ts, have tunn'd the Scales, Her Maje&s;ty has been prevail'd with to change Hands in the Administration, and we have a new Court Revolution. There is no doubt but</HI> HER MAJESTY <HI>has an unquestion'd</HI> AUTHORITY <HI>to change Hands as often as &s;eems meet to Her Royal Judgment; that Prince has but little Authority left that cannot be&s;tow Her Per&s;onal E&s;teem&punc; as She her &s;elf plea&s;es. Th$&s;e Pamphlets, who reproach the Queen with Turning out Mini&s;ters of State, without just Rea&s;on, or without &s;hewing Cau&s;e for her Di&s;like, are Lampoons upon the Prerogative, Satyrs upon the Con&s;ti|tution, and very Unmannerly upon the Queen. who has &s;o undoubted a Right to employ who She plea&s;es, that no Loyal Subject will offer to &s;ay to her in that Ca&s;e, What do&s;t thou? It would be to divest the Queen of her true</HI> Regalia, <HI>the Scepter; to take from Her the Power of Regulating Her Hou&s;hold, and Putting in, or Putting out Her Servants</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Nor is Her Maje&s;ty's Power of Di&s;&s;olving or Pro$ogueing Parliaments any more to be disputed, than that of Placing and Displacing Officers and Servants; and therefore I am to confe&s;s as to a Paper call'd</HI> Queries <HI>lately publi&s;hed, I think the first Query a most ab|&s;urd and ridiculous Thing (viz.)</HI> Whether ever any Parliament had more de&s;erv'd to &s;it again than this? <HI>Speaking &s;trictly of the Duty of Parliaments, and the Rea&s;on and End of their Sitting, no Parliament can de&s;erve of the Queen; they may de&s;erve the Ac|knowledgment of the People: But to &s;ay a Parliament are to de&s;erve of the Sovereign, would be a keen Satyr upon the Hou&s;e, or upon the Crown, and that for many Rea&s;ons not &s;o fit to enlarge upon; all the Zeal, the Vigour, the Fidelity and Application they are capable of, in Defence of the Liberties of the People, which they are entru&s;ted with, is their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, all their Care for the Honour and Support of the Monarchy, and Defence of the Per&s;on and Authority of their Sovereign, that tis con&s;i&s;tent with the Zeal, Vigour and Fidelity afore&s;aid, is their Duty; in doing this&punc; they di&s;charge their Trust like true Patriots and Loyal Subjects: But to talk of their De&s;erving by this to &s;it again, $s a Lan|guage very Unparliamentary, and many have Con&s;tructions very Fatal put upon it; by the &s;ame Rule they may de&s;erve to &s;it for ever and for aye; and the Triennial Act which we ju&s;tly think a &s;afe Guard to our Liberties, would</HI> ip&s;o facto, <HI>be repeal'd by the Nature of the Thing</HI>.</P>

<P>All that I can &s;ee of Nece&s;&s;ity, depends upon Her Maje&s;ty's being Con|vinc'd that the&s;e new Men are Faithful to Her, and more Devoted to Her true In|tere&s;t, more Capable to &s;upport Her than the other.</P>

<P>There is another Nece&s;&s;ity, which may have &s;omething in it (<HI>viz.</HI>) a Nece|&s;&s;ity on the High Tory &s;ide (<HI>viz.</HI>) that whereas they had &s;o behav'd and ju&s;tly ex|pos'd them&s;elves to the Re&s;entment of the Parliament and Mini&s;try, that they mu&s;t be &s;ure to be ruin'd, if they continu'd, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to them to have the one Di&s;&s;olv'd and the other Chang'd.

<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible they can take good Mea&s;ures with &s;uch In&s;tru|ments as they have. Now upon their Work to begin where they begun, I mean with Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>. It is below me to give him the Terms he de|&s;erves: But as General <HI>Stanhope</HI> ob&s;erv'd upon his Tryal, <HI>A Contemptible Tool, &s;et up by a Party to in&s;ult the Con&s;titution, and fly in the Face of the Admi|ni&s;tration</HI>. They could not have pick'd out of the whole Nation, a Man, who&s;e Impudence was fitter to be at the Head of a bad Cau&s;e, and who&s;e Character is le&s;s able to &s;upport him; a Man of little Learning, le&s;s Mode&s;ty, and no Vertue; Scandalous in his Behaviour in every particular, of a mo&s;t Infamous Reputation, and of a mo&s;t unheard of Degree of Pride, qualify'd for any thing that was Affronting either to God or Man; who could call God to witne&s;s to a Thing at a Bar of Ju&s;tice, and make a je&s;t of the &s;ame thing in Conver&s;ation in the &s;olemne&s;t manner; and with a whining Accent, to move compa&s;&s;ion upon his Tryal before the Lords, prote&s;t his Loyalty to the Per&s;on of the Queen, and Zeal for her Intere&s;t, and drink on his Knees to the <HI>Pretender</HI> as his Lawful Sovereign in another Company; a Fellow qualify'd to Bully the Nation, and to make Madmen more Lunatick.

<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you fir&s;t.

Nor do I believe they had any hand in his late un&s;ufferable In&s;olence in his country Cavalcade. His Sermon they condemn'd as a piece of pulpit-Raving.

<P>I'll tell you what they &s;ay: They&punc; &s;ay the pre&s;ent humour of the People &s;erves their pre&s;ent De&s;igns; it is not a Time to pu&s;h Things too far. The Affair of <HI>Sacheverell</HI> broke the Ice for them&punc; 'tis become popu|lar; it has been a mean to run down the other Party; and thus far they have &s;erv'd them&s;elves of it. That the Impeachment was a wrong Step, and brought the Church into the Quarrel; that they were oblig'd to take the Occa&s;ion, and bring about what they aim'd at before, when they knew nothing of that Ac|cident: But that for the Man they abhor him; and whereas he is blown up with Pride, upon the Opinion of their Approbation, they have nothing to
<PB N="23" REF="26">
ridicule him for more that he has no more Countenance from them, he has done their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and they have no more to &s;ay to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I make no que&s;tion, but he will render him&s;elf as Contemptible to them in Time, as he is to us; but in the mean time the Nation is full of in|tollerable In&s;olency on his Account, and a Spirit of Tumult and Riot runs thro' the Nation, which fits the People for any Violence, the Conniving at which, by the&s;e new People, encourages it &s;o much, that it may &s;oon ri&s;e to an Height, too great for them&s;elves to quench; and to prompt a People to Tumult and Rebellion, was never, that I know of, thought any part of good Politicks, in a Government calculated as ours is, to &s;upport Property, and pro|tect Ju&s;tice. The&s;e Things give me a general Su&s;picion of the Party, that their De&s;ign cannot be good, when the Means to bring it to pa&s;s is &s;o perni|cious to the Nation's Good. As to the Impeachment, I am clear, the Nece&s;&s;i|ty of puni&s;hing &s;o much In&s;olence was unavoidable; if it had any evil Effects, it was from the Conduct of that Party, who prevented his being treated more &s;uitable to his De&s;erts, and who &s;uffer'd our Mobbs unpuni&s;h'd, not only to In|&s;ult Ju&s;tice in its very Execution, but to ridicule and triumph over that part of it, which <HI>on all other Occa&s;ions would have been call'd Moderation</HI>, as an Ef|fect of Fear, and a Submi&s;&s;ion to the Clamours of the Street. But I look on this Impeachment as a very &s;mall part of this Affair: the Blood was &s;tagnate before, and the Di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t have broken out &s;omewhere, if not there.</P>

<P>I know, had the Thing been pro&s;ecuted, as I think it &s;hould have been, and the Criminal been &s;everely puni&s;h'd, the Impeaching him was a Step founded on Wi&s;dom, Prudence and Nece&s;&s;ity; <HI>and I think no body can deny it</HI>. But as it was run down by a Party, it has been a Handle to ruine the be&s;t Intere&s;t, and has been the Foundation of all the Confu&s;ion that has follow'd; and on that Score, I wi&s;h they had taken other Mea&s;ures with him.</P>

But come we next to the Con&s;equences of this Mi&s;chief which is the Remove of the Mini&s;try; and this, they &s;ay, there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for. I cannot &s;ee this Nece&s;&s;ity. This Caviling Author, who under the Title of <HI>Double</HI> is brought in owning more Crimes than the Age has &s;een committed, lays the univer&s;al Scandal of every thing upon the Mini&s;try, th$$ if <HI>we

Nay, he goes back and tells you, it was long of them the Old Coin was Clip'd and Defac'd, tho' all the World knows they had no other Concern in it than to rectify that Evil, which they did to a Prodigy. Here he rummages every Action, not for what is well in it, but for &s;omewhat to find $word$ with; the Victories gain'd have not been enough improv'd to &s;atisfy him: The Cre|dit has &s;uffer'd, tho' rais'd from nothing to the highe&s;t pitch: The Nation has been impos'd upon: The Generals prolong the War; and a Thou&s;and &s;uch Things. But where is the Matter of Fact to appear? The March into <HI>Bavaria</HI> was again&s;t the Will of the Party; they In&s;ulted and Threatned the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> upon it, and a certain Per&s;on of Figure, &s;w$re by G&mdash;d it &s;hould co&s;t him his Head. Had he mi&s;carry'd in it, no doubt he would have done his Devoir to have it &s;o.

<P>The St. <HI>Germains</HI> Letter found at <HI>Dovay</HI> States it very plain, they promi&s;e them&s;elves nothing by Force; but Two Things they mu&s;t build upon, both derived from our New Breaches. 1<HI>st</HI> The &s;inking of our Credit. 2<HI>dly.</HI> The Diffirence of our Allies in the Point of our &s;tanding by them.

their Queen in the Employments they are Tru&s;ted with; they do not &s;erve this or that Mini&s;ter of State, but they &s;erve the Government; and if the New Mini&s;try pur|&s;ued the ju&s;t and proper Mea&s;ures &s;uited to the Foundation on which we &s;tand, there was no need of putting the&s;e out, and con&s;equently no Nece&s;&s;ity of bringing in <HI>To|ries</HI> for want of Hands.</P>

But how can this be done by <HI>Tories</HI> and Enemies to the Con&s;titution? Did not the Queen once try the&s;e Men? Was She not oblig'd to throw them off? Was not, as you noted ju&s;t now, this very Gentleman, now at the head of the Management, the very Man that a&s;&s;i&s;ted in Turning them oll out, and to his Honour, &s;av'd the Queen and the whole Nation from their unaccountable Projects? It is the &s;trange&s;t Mea&s;ure to my Apprehen&s;ion, that ever a Man could take in the State, to bring in a Party that he had thrown out before, purely upon Principles of Safety. What Credit, what Foun|dation have they for the Government to re&s;t upon, or by which they can uphold the Nation in this time of Exigence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed the Credit of that Party is low enough, and that is, no doubt the Rea&s;on why the Publick Credit has &s;ink &s;o much upon their being brought in.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Publick Credit has, till now, &s;urmounted all that ever went before it; and by this Thing, call'd <HI>Credit$</HI>, we have for tho&s;e many Years pa&s;t, carry'd on the War at an Expence much &s;uperior to our Strength, and this Breach upon the Mini&s;try, as in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, it will be, mu&s;t be a Shock to it. I will not &s;ay, but this Blow might be warded off, had they gone on at fir&s;t with moderate Steps; but this bringing <HI>Tories</HI> in, Hot, Mad, Raging <HI>Tories</HI>, this will, in my weak Judgment, quite fini&s;h the Tragedy, and de&s;troy that Credit, which was wounded before. No Man will venture his Money in Tory Hands; they have no Honour, no Regard to the Publick Good, or to private Right, otherwi&s;e than as it &s;uits with their Party. The Nation expects nothing from them, and therefore will do nothing for them.</P>

<P>The great Complaint they make runs pa&s;t the &s;ame way, they tell you, that the Managemement of the Exchequer has been prepo&s;terous, that the Or|der of Things has been partially Di&s;pos'd, that a great Debt lies on the Navy, to &s;upport other Avocations; and they run a mighty length on the Di&s;count of the Victualling Bills, the Pil$ the Government is oblig'd to give for Provi&s;ions, Stores, &amp;c and they lay this all to the Door of the old Mini&s;try.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All this is begging the Que&s;tion, becau&s;e there is a Court where this Cau&s;e is to be heard, if there has been any thing of that kind done, which there are not good Rea&s;ons to ju&s;tifie, and which the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Publick Service did not re|quire; then indeed the Weight will fall upon Per&s;ons; and we do not &s;ee that they make the lea&s;t Preparation to e&s;cape you, or to &s;hun coming to a Hearing: 'Tis time enough to rai&s;e an Argument upon this, when it has been try'd on the other hand, if the Exigencies of the Government, unexpected Occa&s;ions, unfore&s;een Service, or ju&s;tifiable Accidents of the War has call'd for greater Sums than was ex|pected, or has call'd for tho&s;e Sums fa&s;ter than they could be gotten in. This is part of the general Calamity of the War, and may be the Fate of the pre&s;ent, as it may have been the Fate of the pa&s;t Mini&s;try. But leaving the&s;e things to their Examination, this is not the State of the Ca&s;e, with all the&s;e Di&s;advantages; the Credit of the Nation was Great to a Degree not to be equall'd; and the Value of that Credit to us, in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, is too great to be &s;lighted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They pretend this Credit was &s;inking before, and would have fallen lower than it is now by a great deal, if this Change had not been made, and that the Old Mini&s;try could not have &s;upported it or them&s;elves much longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There has been a Party that has all along &s;aid &s;o; and have told us, that we could find no more Funds, that we could not &s;tand another Year, that we mu&s;t make Peace, and that Ways and Means would fail us. Yet when the Time came, we always found my Lord Trea&s;urer had his Schemes ready, and Money was ne|ver wanting to lend, or Funds on which to borrow. But if <HI>Tories</HI> come into play, we &s;hall &s;ee where they will produce either as to the Debt upon the Navy, Victu|alling Stores, &amp;c. It is true, they run to a great Di&s;count; but this was owing only to the Uncertainty of Payment. My Ld. T&mdash;r had no more to do in the next Parlia|ment, than to bring bring them upon the foot of &s;ome certain Fund, which &s;hould a&s;cer|tain when they &s;hould be paid, and in the mean time &s;hould di&s;charge the Intere&s;t, and that Clamour would cea&s;e, the Di&s;count would not only fall, but the People would be as eager to lay them up, as they are their Annuities, Exchequer Bills, and other certain Credits on the Government. So that all the Noi&s;e rais'd about the great Debt of the Navy, turns upon this Hinge only, not whether a Parliament can, or &s;hall make it good, but whether the Trea&s;urer is blameable in letting it run on, as it has done or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have &s;tated this very clearly. Credit was at a Pitch it cannot be re&s;tor'd to. But tho&s;e People tell us, as I &s;aid before, we were going down the Wind before that Credit began to decline, and could not be &s;upported, nor could the Fall of our Credit be prevented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had that been true, there was the le&s;s need of this Blow to give a Stab in|to the Vitals upon Pre&s;umption of Curing it again. I know what a certain Great man, and now Leader of this Management has been pleas'd to publi&s;h to the World in Print, in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay upon Credit</HI> (viz.) <HI>That Credit depends not on the Mini&s;try, nor on this or that Great Manager, but upon the Parliament, and upon a Ju&s;t, Honorable and Punctual Di&s;charge of every Trust, and a fair Management</HI>. And this is very true. But then it follows, which I &s;uppo&s;e the Right Honourable the Author did not forget, but omitted, for good Rea&s;ons, <HI>That this Honourable, Punctual Di&s;charge</HI>, &amp;c. mu&s;t be, and appear to be, <HI>Quia Idem est non e&s;&s;e &amp; non apperere</HI>, before the &s;aid Credit, which he &s;ays depends upon it, can be produc'd. Every Cau&s;e is Prior and Antecedent to its Effect; and can't he tell us what we mu&s;t do in the mean time? An <HI>Interreg|num</HI> in the Kingdom of Credit is entirely De&s;tructive of its Con&s;titution; it mu&s;t require &s;ome time of Probation, it &s;eems, for this Punctual Management to appear. I will not &s;ay, that Author, who has &s;o much of it in his Power; cannot bring it to
<PB N="30" REF="32">
pa&s;s. Nor will I &s;ugge&s;t, that he will not take all po&s;&s;ible Mea&s;ures to do &s;o. But I may be allow'd to &s;ay, it will require &s;ome Time to do it; as in a Pleuri&s;ie, if the Sur|geon be too far to fetch, the Patient may Die, for want of opening a Vein to give a due Circulation; &s;o Credit once lo&s;t, for want of the Experiment, may be pa&s;t fetch|ing to Life, when 'tis done.</P>
<P>The ju&s;t reflection of the&s;e things makes them talk of the Landed Men &s;etting up again&s;t the Money'd Men, and the Error of borrowing upon Funds, when the Mo|ney &s;hould have been rais'd Yearly for every Years Expence; but the&s;e that know the&s;e things perfectly, mu&s;t know that the Annual Sums the War has requir'd, have been too great for this Nation to rai&s;e within a Year; and that the borrowing upon Funds has been the happy Expedient, without which the War could not be carried on. That Land is a good Security for the &s;upport of the War, and the Landed Men, who, they &s;ay, are on their &s;ide, may do much; yet I &s;hould begin to pity them, tho' they had all the Land in the Nation on their Hands, if the Money'd Men, by any particular Fate, &s;hould be prevented lending their Help, and Credit &s;hould &s;ink &s;o low, as that their Funds &s;hould meet with no Anticipations.</P>

<P>You mi&s;take me again, I am for di&s;tingui&s;hing clo&s;er than that; I am for di&s;tingui&s;hing between tho&s;e that <HI>are come in</HI>, and tho&s;e that <HI>are to come in</HI>, that is, between tho&s;e that were fir&s;t put in, and tho&s;e they may be, have been &s;aid to bring in after them. I own, I was among them that regretted the fir&s;t Remove; I thought there was not the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion for it, Things went on well abroad, the Enemy began to &s;ubmit, and with this Campaign we might have &s;een <HI>France</HI> humbled. If there were any Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, any Errors, any Objection, they were not among the In$$rables, they would have ea&s;ily admitted a Remedy; and all our Party Differen|ces might have been accommodated among us without a Breach that &s;hould influ|ence our Allies, touch our National Peace, and put new Hopes into a De&s;ponding Enemy. The&s;e were my Thoughts upon the general Article$ when I &s;aw the fir&s;t Removes, tho' I confe&s;s I was &s;orry for it, yet I thought there might &s;till be &s;ome room for the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hing Things, and that the Men put in, as they had no Views before them, but what were &s;aid on a moderate Management, would have brought in Men qualify'd for a Concurrence with &s;uch a Principle; but when a &s;econd and a third Tru&s;t was given, and I &s;aw who follow'd to the Breach, and who enter'd Pell|mell with the fir&s;t, <HI>Then I gave up all, and De&s;pair'd</HI>; nor have I any thing left to expect, unle&s;s One of Two Things fall out, which I wi&s;h may appear practicable</P>

<P>I am a plain-Dealer, and will tell you freely my Thoughts: Suppo&s;ing the fir&s;t of the&s;e People are really acting upon Moderate Schemes and Revolution Principles, and this you will allow is a great deal to grant: But &s;uppo&s;e it, the <HI>Review</HI> &s;ays <HI>they must</HI>, that they cannot &s;tir Hand or $$o but in that &s;trait Lane, I am not of his Opinion, there may be middle dark and by Ways that neither he or I know of. But I'll &s;uppo&s;e for once, <HI>what I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee, (viz.</HI>) That the New Managers &s;hall proceed by Moderate Mea&s;ures and Schemes taken from the Re|volution,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
that they &s;hall carry an even Hand in their Steering between the Parties and make no Breaches upon our Settlements, either Religious or Civil, the&s;e two Things mu&s;t follow.</P>
<P N="1">I. That they mu&s;t Over-rule, and Re&s;train the <HI>Tories</HI> they have taken in, or,</P>
<P N="2">II. Turn them out again.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Two Things of which I &s;ay I have nothing left to expect, unle&s;s one of them &s;hall happen; and if either of them &s;hould fall out, I &s;hall own 'tis more than I look for al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are material Things, and I know they pretend to &s;ay, that is their Re&s;olution in their publick Management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but if they do pretend to it, they would do well to tell us how they are &s;ure they &s;hall not let in too many for them to Ma&s;ter, like Men cutting a Bank in a flowing River to Water the Grounds, near it the force of the Stream makes the Breach &s;o wide, that they that made it cannot &s;top it, and &s;o the Lands in&s;tead of being Watered, are Drowned. A Man makes a Fire to Warm him, but if he does not keep it under, and within the Bounds of the FIRE-PLACE, it takes hold of the Hou&s;e, and he cannot quench it; then he cries out for help, but it's too late, he &s;hould have taken Care to have made no more Fire than he could keep under. Now, if they pretend to over-rule and re&s;train the <HI>Tories</HI> they bring in, they had be&s;t take heed they do not let in too many. The like is to be &s;aid as to the Second, The <HI>Tories</HI> will not be Over-rul'd or Re&s;train'd, &s;ays the Scheme; they may be turn'd out: But remember the Soldier that took a <HI>Tartar</HI>, he would neither come with him, nor let him come without him: If they can &s;ay they will not be Re&s;train'd, they may &s;ay they will not <HI>Turn Out</HI> neither: And from this farther; for if Moderate Men cannot get <HI>Tories</HI> turn'd out, the <HI>Tories</HI> will certainly get the Moderate Men turn'd Out: And thus all the good De&s;igns we pre|tend to will &s;ink in this, <HI>The Flood is too &s;trong for us</HI>, and we cannot help it. This will all end as Sir <HI>George Jefferyes</HI> his Glory expired, when after all his Elevation, he found him&s;elf in a clo&s;e Pri&s;on, all he thought fit to &s;ay of it was, <HI>Who would ha' thought it</HI>?</P>

<P>This brings you back to my Que&s;tion about the War; I would be glad to have a Word or two about that with you, for I am in no &s;mall pain about it, and really the Difficulties &s;tate them&s;elves very formidably to me, I am afraid of the War&punc; afraid of the Peace; I know not what Point to come to in the Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Point no Man can be ea&s;y in, that has a ju&s;t Concern for the E|vent of Things. I make no doubt carrying on the War will be the Pretence, yet they openly charge the Old Management with having a De&s;ign to protract the War: They tell us in the Conce&s;&s;ions of the <HI>French</HI> in their la&s;t Proposal, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Of con|tinuing Money to the War in <HI>Spain</HI> to Di&s;$po&s;&s;e&s;s the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>, were &s;ufficient at lea&s;t it was all you could have Rea&s;on to demand of him; that to bid him Sur|render <HI>Spain</HI> after you had oblig'd him to withdraw all his Auxilary Troops from thence, was Ridiculous, and asking him to give what was not in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that you might have demanded Cautionary Towns for the Security of the Perfor|mance:
<PB N="32" REF="34" MS="Y">
And there was no doubt it would have been granted; and that you had brought the <HI>French</HI> to &s;uch low Terms, that if you had been at the Gates of <HI>Paris</HI> you could have asked no more. The&s;e are the Arguments they bring to prove that we had no De&s;ign to make Peace at all; that carrying on the War is rather the View and that other Ends are re&s;erved by it and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For my part whatever they may &s;ay of managing <HI>the Treaty, I</HI> think 'tis clear <HI>the War</HI> has not been carried on as if that were the View; the Duke of <HI>Marle|borough</HI> has not Fought as if he de&s;ign'd to carry on the War, unle&s;s it be <HI>to the Gates of Paris</HI>, no Prince has ever pu&s;h'd a War on with more Ardour, and with better Succe&s;s, and 'tis to this Pu&s;hing the <HI>French</HI>, that we owe the Conce&s;&s;ions for a Peace which they have made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is very clear to me, that the War has been carry'd well on; it is al&s;o clear to us all, that the Offers of the King of <HI>France</HI> were far from a Security to us for the Surrender of <HI>Spain</HI>; the In&s;incerity of the <HI>French</HI> in all their Treaties &s;uffi|ciently Ju&s;tifies the Allies u&s;ing the utmo&s;t Concern in the point of Security; and by the con&s;equences it &s;eems clear to me, that the <HI>French</HI> had no De&s;ign to act with <HI>Candour</HI> in this Treaty, &s;ince it is apparent to all the World, that at the &s;ame time they were Negotiating a Treaty with <HI>Spain</HI> Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive, and the King of <HI>France</HI> had given A&s;&s;urances to his Grand&s;on that he would never Abandon him. If the&s;e Things are true, then from an unan&s;werable Proof, that all that caution and backwardne&s;s of the Allies in the Treaty were nece&s;&s;ary, and ju&s;tifiable to Rea&s;on and the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t: And if the&s;e Gentlemen think fit to put an end to the War, by making a Peace le&s;s &s;afe and upon le&s;s &s;evere Conditions than the other, it will not be long I believe before the Nation will be convinc'd who has pur&s;u'd the right Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI>, the Old Mini&s;try or the New.</P>
