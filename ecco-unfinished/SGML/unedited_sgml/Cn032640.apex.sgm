<P>My di&s;appointment &s;hall not prejudice me a|gain&s;t the female world, as I am convinced there are many, who in ever$ re&s;pect do honour to human nature, alleviating by their tenderne&s;s, the woes of life, and by their &s;miles improving all their joys.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can I depend on you, who by your own account, don't come from the right place to be much credited; be&s;ides is it likely you can grant me three wi&s;hes, when you are not able to afford one for your&s;elf.</P>
