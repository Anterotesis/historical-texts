<HEAD>A VOYAGE TO THE <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Year of our Lord 1721, on the 14th Day of <HI>September,</HI> I made a Contract with Mr. <HI>Dennis Lang|tor,</HI> Merchant and Gold&s;mith, liv|ing at the <HI>Wheat&s;heaf</HI> in <HI>Lombard|&s;treet,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Ady,</HI> Packer, living in the Hou&s;e that was Sheriff <HI>Corni&s;h</HI>'s near <HI>Blackwell-Hall-Gate,</HI> and Captain <HI>Andrew Scott,</HI> living then on <HI>Little Tower-Hill,</HI> to go to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Sloop there call'd the <HI>Dolphin;</HI> and there to buy a Cargo to &s;lave with on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea;</HI> and from thence to proceed to <HI>Virginia</HI> or <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> as I found would be mo&s;t to the Gentlemens Advan|tage who were concern'd with me; from thence to load or take Freight to <HI>London:</HI> To which the before-mentioned Gentlemen &s;ign'd an Obligation for the Payment of their Dividends, both for Sloop
<PB N="2" REF="8">
and Cargo; and by their Order I &s;hipp'd a Chi|rurgeon to go from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Virginia</HI> for half Pay, and from thence to be in whole Pay 'till ar|rived in the <HI>Thames.</HI> Captain <HI>Andrew Scott</HI> at the &s;ame time being Commander of the <HI>King Sa|gamore,</HI> a Ship of twenty two Guns, and bound from the <HI>Thames,</HI> to touch at the I&s;land of <HI>Ma|dera,</HI> at the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, at the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> from thence to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and from <HI>Virginia,</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> &amp;c. And I agreed with Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> by Con&s;ent of the other Owners, who were to be concern'd with me in the above-mention'd Sloop and Cargo, to go his Chief Mate in the <HI>King Sagamore,</HI> till we arrived at <HI>Virginia,</HI> and then and there to be di&s;charged, to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the before-mentioned Sloop; and accordingly I went on Board, as al&s;o my Chirurgeon, for who&s;e Pa&s;&s;age I contracted to <HI>Virginia;</HI> al&s;o the Che&s;t of Me|dicines was put on Board by the afore-mention'd Gentlemen, to be delivered to me at our Arri|val in <HI>Virginia.</HI> We proceeded on our Voyage according to Appointment, but in the Channel meeting with contrary Winds, we were oblig'd to put into <HI>Plymouth,</HI> a very commodious Har|bour for Shipping, lying in the County of <HI>De|von,</HI> where we were forc'd to lie for a fair Wind near two Months. We happen'd to be there at that time when my Lord <HI>Belhaven</HI> was going Governor to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> in the <HI>Royal Anne</HI> Galley Man of War, who put into this Port a few Days after us; and the Wind &s;hortly after pre&s;ent|ing fair, tho' the Weather look'd very un&s;ettled, and the Wind not like to &s;tand, the Man of War in which his Lord&s;hip was, &s;ailed, and had not been long out before they met with hard and contrary Gales of Wind, which (as was &s;up|po&s;ed by the Ra&s;hne&s;s of their Lieutenant) oc|ca&s;ion'd
<PB N="3" REF="9">
that &s;ad Tragedy of their Lives which is not unknown to mo&s;t People in <HI>England.</HI> Cap|tain <HI>Scott</HI> was inclinable to &s;ail at the &s;ame time that the Man of War did, but I per&s;waded him to wait a little till he &s;aw the Wind and Weather better &s;ettled, at lea&s;t, not to go out now it was almo&s;t Night, and would be Night before we could have got the Ship unmoor'd; and, as I told him, if the Wind continued till next Morn|ing, then in God's Name to proceed; which Ad|vice Captain <HI>Scott</HI> took, and the more willing, becau&s;e he had given Orders the Day before, to kill &s;ome Beef for the Voyage, which we could not have till the next Day, which proving but untoward Weather, as well as a foul Wind, obli|ged us to lie there near a Month after my Lord <HI>Belhaven</HI> &s;ail'd out in the Man of War; during which time we heard from <HI>Falmouth,</HI> that my Lord and almo&s;t all the Souls that were in the Man of War, were ca&s;t away on the Stagg Rocks off the <HI>Lizard.</HI> After we had lain Wind|bound a con&s;iderable time, it plea&s;ed God to &s;end moderate Weather, with an indifferent fair Wind, which Opportunity thus offer'd, we laid hold of, and &s;ail'd, and met with nothing worth no|ting, 'till we arrived near the Latitude of <HI>Ma|dera,</HI> at which time Captain <HI>Scott</HI> altering his Mind, or, at lea&s;t, it was the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of the altering of his Mind or Owners Orders, he would not touch at <HI>Madera,</HI> but re&s;olv'd to touch at the I&s;land of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> it being one of the <HI>Ca|nary</HI> I&s;lands, and indeed, for Traffick the be&s;t of them; which accordingly we did, and an|chor'd in the Road of <HI>Oratava,</HI> where Captain <HI>Scott</HI> barter'd &s;ome Goods for Wine. We were forced out of the Roads by rea&s;on of a <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Wind coming, which all Ships there, when tho&s;e Winds come, are obliged to do. We
<PB N="4" REF="10">
&s;lipp'd our Moorings, and put to Sea, leaving Captain <HI>Scott</HI> a&s;hore on the I&s;land, as often hap|pens to Cammanders of Ships who trade there; for there is no &s;ending the Boat for them, nor waiting for them to come off, for as &s;oon as ever a <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> is perceived, which mo&s;t times is fore-&s;hewed by a <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Swell rouling in, they are oblig'd to &s;lip their Moorings, for which Rea&s;on they have always Ship-Buoys ready bent: Seldom, or never, any Ships that are forc'd from thence by the&s;e Winds, &s;tay to take up their An|chors, for if they &s;hould, they might run a great Hazard of lo&s;ing the Ship and their Lives too. But that <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> that forced us out, did not prove &s;o bad as we expected; &s;o that the &s;econd Day after we &s;lipp'd our Cables, we got into the Road, and took in our Moorings again; and as &s;oon as we got our Wine in, which was about forty Pipes, we &s;ailed, having been about ten Days at this I&s;land; and altho' there are many Things remarkable about and on this I&s;land, not vulgarly known, which might be Matter of Profit as well as Delight to know, (among which may be rank'd the great Coral-Tree, which, perhaps, is the large&s;t of that Kind yet known in the World; al&s;o the Gold Mine within Point <HI>de Nagos,</HI> on account of which a poor Man, be|ing more ha&s;ty to get rich than his Neighbours, was taken on one of tho&s;e golden Mountains, with &s;uch Tools or In&s;truments about him, as plainly &s;hew'd what he had been a hunting for; they found al&s;o &s;ome Gold about him, for which they hanged him but a few Days before we ar|rived here;) yet by rea&s;on it is an I&s;land pretty much re&s;orted to by our Shipping, I &s;hall wave giving any further De&s;cription of it, (only that on the&s;e I&s;lands is made the mo&s;t generous Wine that is made, I think, in the Univer&s;e) and left
<PB N="5" REF="11">
I &s;hould &s;eem to &s;ome (as the Proverb goes) to light a Candle to &s;ee the Day, I &s;hall proceed on in my Narration of our farther Proceedings. We &s;ailed from the I&s;land of <HI>Teneriff</HI> in the Even|ing with a light Gale of Wind about the <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>North,</HI> but after we had got an Offing from the I&s;land, the Gale fre&s;hen'd up and continued, we had Sight of the Pike of <HI>Teneriff</HI> (which is a high peeked Mountain, by &s;ome &s;up|po&s;ed to be the highe&s;t Mountain in the World) all the next Day, till Night; and altho' we then reckon'd our&s;elves to be little le&s;s than forty Leagues di&s;tant from the Pike, yet we could &s;ee it very plain. We met with nothing very re|markable all the Pa&s;&s;age, 'till we made the I&s;land of <HI>Sal,</HI> which is one of the Windwardmo&s;t of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, for which Rea&s;on I always endeavour'd to make that I&s;land fir&s;t, when bound to touch at any of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> I&s;lands: We made this I&s;land of <HI>Sal</HI> in the Morning, and I, by the Captain's Order, went a&s;hore with the Pinnace and &s;ix Men arm'd, in a Bay call'd <HI>Palmera,</HI> to &s;ee what we could ob&s;erve: At our Landing&punc; we found &s;ome Huts, which were in good Repair, and &s;eem'd by the Gra&s;s which was in them, that &s;ome People had lately been there, which made me &s;u&s;pect that there might be &s;ome Turtle-catchers here &s;ince the la&s;t Tur|tle Sea&s;on, or they might be Men &s;hipwreck'd, or by other Accidents left there, as by Pirates, &amp;c. After I had gone a little farther towards the Palm-Trees, I &s;aw two Fire-Places, which, by the Fre&s;hne&s;s of the A&s;hes, &s;eem'd to have been but lately made; and &s;ome Heaps of Fi&s;h-Bones lying by the Fire-Places, which were not thoroughly dry; the under Part of them, as al&s;o the Middle of the Heap being moi&s;t, which I turn'd up on Purpo&s;e; the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I &s;ay, far|ther
<PB N="6" REF="12">
confirm'd my Opinion that there were &s;ome People upon the I&s;land, the Certainty of which I was willing to be &s;atisfied in; for which Cau&s;e I divided my Men into two Companies, re&s;olv|ing, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover whether there was any People on the I&s;land, or not: We walk'd and &s;earch'd as high up as the Middle of the I&s;land, without di&s;covering any Creature of hu|mane Kind; we &s;aw abundance of &s;mall Land Birds, A&s;&s;es, &amp;c. And Captain <HI>Scott</HI> fearing that &s;ome Accident might have befallen us, made a Signal for us to come on Board, which I did as &s;oon as I could get the Men together. We got on Board about Eight a Clock at Night, and brought off with us &s;ome Land-Crabs, Dates, and three or four of the wild bitter Gourds, whereof there is great Plenty there; (with which the Natives in tho&s;e I&s;lands commonly purge them&s;elves, as we do here, under the Name of <HI>Coloquintidum</HI> or <HI>Alhandal)</HI> the&s;e were all we found there that was remarkable, at this Time. As &s;oon as we came on Board, and got the Boat in, we made Sail for the I&s;land of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> it being the I&s;land re&s;olv'd upon to make a Cargo of Salt, and the next Day we arriv'd at <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> and anchor'd in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Road, as they call it, under the little I&s;land, about ten a Clock at Night, in about five Fathom Water, clear &s;andy Ground within the &s;unken Rock.</P>
<P>Next Day I went a&s;hore with Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> to agree with the Inhabitants for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to bring the Salt from the Salt-Ponds down to the Water-&s;ide; as al&s;o to &s;ettle the Prizes of our Goods, and al&s;o of their Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, &amp;c. for we were to take in Hor&s;es and A&s;&s;es after we had got our Salt on Board. Captain <HI>Scott</HI> being an utter Stranger to all the&s;e I&s;lands, as well as the <HI>Ca|nary</HI> I&s;lands, both as to their Language and Trade,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
I was forc'd to be with him, as well on the Trad|ing Account, as of &s;peaking the <HI>Lingua;</HI> &s;o having &s;ettled all Matters relating to our Trading and Bu&s;ine&s;s there, we went to work to make our Salt as fa&s;t as we could; it being cu&s;tomary in tho&s;e Voyages for the Ship's Crew to make the Salt for the Cargo them&s;elves, and after it is made, to carry or wheel it out a little Way from the Ponds, to a dry Place, and there to heap it up in large Heaps to drain and dry; from thence the Natives bring it down upon A&s;&s;es at &s;o much <HI>per diem, per</HI> A&s;s, and likewi&s;e to the Black that drives the A&s;&s;es; one Black being commonly allow'd to every fifteen A&s;&s;es, who is employ'd to drive them; every Ma&s;ter of a Ship be&s;peaking his A&s;&s;es and Drivers in Proportion to his Company and Craft that he has to &s;hip it off with; for it mu&s;t not be brought down to the Landing-place any fa&s;ter than it can be &s;hipp'd off, for if it be, the Sand is &s;o light, and there being commonly in the Day a fre&s;h Breeze of Wind, that the Salt would be blown &s;o full of Sand, that it would &s;poil your Salt, and make it good for no|thing, as I have often &s;een experienc'd, and at &s;everal Times by Ma&s;ters, (both at this I&s;land, and al&s;o at the I&s;le of <HI>May)</HI> who were over-ha&s;ty to have their Salt brought down, and not having Hands enough, or their Craft being out of Or|der, have cau&s;ed a Sail to be &s;pread on the Sand to lay the Salt upon, and notwith&s;tanding they took all the Care they could to keep it cover'd with another Sail, except when they were a &s;tart|ing the Salt brought down, or carrying down to &s;hip off; yet, I &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding all their Care, the Salt was &s;o full of Sand, that they had better a hove it over-board than took it in, for I am per|&s;waded it did more Harm to the Sale of their Cargo, than it was worth; but there are &s;ome
<PB N="8" REF="14">
Men think if they can but get their Ship loaden, that's enough. Sometimes when a Ship's Com|pany is but few, the Ma&s;ters are forc'd to hire &s;ome of the Natives to work in the Salt-Ponds while the Salt is making, and al&s;o to work in the &s;hipping the Salt off. I advi&s;ed Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> as he had brought but little Hay with him out of <HI>England</HI> for his live Cargo, to get the Blacks to bring &s;ome down every Day while we were ma|king the Salt; but he depended on the Blacks Words, who told him, they would &s;upply him with Hay enough in one Day, for his Voyage, which made him think it needle&s;s to provide Hay before-hand, tho' I knew to the contrary, as having experience'd them before; but yet, Captain <HI>Scott</HI> depended on their Words, which in the End had like to have been the Lo&s;s of all our live Cargo; and as it was, it &s;poil'd the Sale of them at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> as you will find in the Se|quel of the Story. No Ship being here but our|&s;elves, we had all the Salt-Ponds, to pick and chu&s;e the be&s;t, and had but little Trouble to make our Salt, to what it is &s;ometimes, as I have &s;een when Ships have been forc'd to wait three Weeks or a Month for a&punc;Birth, to make Salt in the Ponds, and then be forc'd to take up with, perhaps, &s;uch ordinary Ponds, that ten or a do|zen Ponds in that poor Ground might not yield much more than one or two Ponds would yield where it is a rich Salt Soil, and yet have as much Labour, in a manner, with tho&s;e Ponds, as you would have in tending the be&s;t Ponds; but we in the making our Cargo, had little more to do but to rake the Salt out of the Ponds, and wheel it out to the Heap. While we lay here, came in a Sloop belonging to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but la&s;t from <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> on the I&s;land of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> and bound to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> he hinder'd us almo&s;t a
<PB N="9" REF="15">
Day's Work; for we not knowing but it might be a Pirate, got all our Hands on Board, and &s;o kept our&s;elves in Readine&s;s to receive him, 'till he &s;ent his Boat on Board, which we commanded, and &s;atisfied us what he was. Now Captain <HI>Scott</HI> having bought more A&s;&s;es by far than he could &s;tow on Board, and it being all in the Sloop's Way, they agreed, that the Sloop &s;hould take in as many A&s;&s;es as &s;he could &s;tow, at &s;o much <HI>per</HI> Head, to be deliver'd at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> After we got our Salt all on Board, we took in Hor&s;es and A&s;&s;es, as many as we could &s;tow, and al&s;o put as many A&s;&s;es on Board the Sloop as &s;he could &s;tow; after which, we were forc'd to &s;tay twenty-four Hours for Gra&s;s and Hay, and then nei|ther, we could not get half enough for the Voy|age; but our Water al&s;o being almo&s;t expended, we could tarry no longer; for you mu&s;t know, that the I&s;land of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t</HI> has no drinking Wa|ter but what lies a long Way up in the Country, and tho&s;e Ships that come there only to make Salt, mu&s;t bring fre&s;h Water enough with them to &s;erve while they are making and &s;hipping off their Salt, or they mu&s;t pay dear for that Water that mu&s;t be brought down out of the Country by the Natives, on A&s;&s;es Backs; but tho&s;e that come here to buy Cattle, if they do not bring Water with them, it is next kin to an Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity, at lea&s;t, it would be &s;o chargeable, as well as tedious, to have their Water brought out of the Country, that it would co&s;t more than the Bea&s;ts; neither could you ever get a Stock of Water this Way, for your Cattle would drink it, in a man|ner, as fa&s;t as it could be brought down. So ha|ving got in all that we could get, we and the Sloop &s;ail'd in Company together, and touch'd at the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> where we met with five Sail of
<PB N="10" REF="16">
Ships loading there with Salt for the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-Coun|try, up the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, among whom we got &s;ome Water, and al&s;o Tobacco, the Want of which had almo&s;t brought a <HI>We&s;t</HI>-Country Famine on us, as the Sailors u&s;ed to term it. We took in &s;ix Cows to carry down to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and one was given to Captain <HI>Scott</HI> for Freight. We &s;tay'd one Night at the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and the next Morn|ing weigh'd for St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which was the Place we de&s;ign'd to take in Water, Hay, and Wood for the Voyage, the Sloop al&s;o being in our Com|pany. Captain <HI>Scott</HI> being ambitious to keep a|head of the Sloop, who went very well, as did we in the Ship al&s;o, crouded all his &s;mall Sails, and would not &s;horten Sail before we came the Length of the Port of <HI>Villa de Praya,</HI> and it blowing a fre&s;h Gale of Wind, and generally off the high Land, and in the Bay there comes off very hard Flaws of Wind; &s;o that &s;tanding with all our Sail out 'till we brought the Bay open, before we could hand our &s;mall Sails, and take a Reef in each Top-&s;ail, to Luff into the Bay, we were drove to Leeward of the Road, and it holding &s;uch taut Gales, and our Decks being clutter'd with the Cattle, that we could not work the Ship &s;o well as we otherwi&s;e might, it was three Days before we could get into the Road; in which Time &s;everal of our A&s;&s;es died, and the re&s;t were &s;o di&s;pirited, that they never recover'd during the Voyage. The Sloop got into <HI>Villa de Praya</HI> the Evening after we came from the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and by the Time that we got into the Bay, he had got all his Water on Board for the Voyage: As &s;oon as we got in, and were moor'd, Captain <HI>Scott</HI> went on Shore to buy Hay and Wood, and to work we went with all our Boats to Water. After we had water'd, wooded, and got as much Hay, green Cocoa-Nuts, &amp;c. for the

Cattle, as could be gotten, we unmoored and weighed from thence with the Sloop in Com|pany, and &s;teered away for the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> meeting with little remarkable in our Pa&s;&s;age down, &s;aving that we met with a dead Whale about the middle of the Pa&s;&s;age, having an innumera|ble Quantity of Fowls about it, notwith&s;tanding it could not be le&s;s than 300 Leagues from any Land. We had mo&s;tly light Winds all the Pa&s;&s;age down till we arriv'd at the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which was on the latter Part of <HI>March,</HI> in the Year 1722. The fir&s;t we did was to get our live Cargo out, which we did as &s;oon as we had Li|berty from the Governor and Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, but both Hor&s;es and A&s;&s;es were &s;o weak and poor, that none of the Hor&s;es, and very few of the A&s;&s;es, were &s;old while we lay here; &s;o that if a Coun|try Genleman had not given Captain <HI>Scott</HI> the feed|ing of his Hor&s;es and A&s;&s;es in the Country <HI>gratis,</HI> after he &s;aw he could not &s;ell them, the cheape&s;t way would have been to have knock'd them all on the Head, for they would have co&s;t more to have put them in a Market Ca&s;e than they would &s;ell for: And likewi&s;e the Wine did not go off ve|ry well; for the Inhabitants of this I&s;land, as likewi&s;e all our I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> being for the mo&s;t part u&s;ed to <HI>Madera</HI> Wine, they did not &s;eem to like &s;o well our <HI>Canary</HI> Wine; nay, mo&s;t of them were afraid to buy it, think|ing it was not good, becau&s;e different in Flavour from that of the I&s;land of <HI>Madera,</HI> their accu&s;|tomed Wine, though the Wine which we brought, as it co&s;t almo&s;t double the Price which Wine com|monly co&s;ts in <HI>Madera,</HI> &s;o it was of twice the Good|ne&s;s of any Wine commonly brought from that I&s;land, tho' it rather &s;old here under the Price of common <HI>Madera</HI> Wine.

Now you mu&s;t know that I had lent Captain <HI>Scott</HI> &s;ome Money at &s;everal Times before our Departure from <HI>London,</HI> to be repay'd me at our Arrival at <HI>Virginia,</HI> which, with the Wages that were due to me on board the <HI>King Sagamore,</HI> came to near Nine|ty Pounds, which I demanded of him; on which his An&s;wer to me was, That he could not rai&s;e that Money at pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on he could not di&s;po&s;e of his Effects, but if I thought well of it, he would buy a Sloop in his own Name, for which he could have Credit on his Effects till they were &s;old, and would make a Bill of Sale to me, to hold a Part in the Sloop proportionable to the Debt; and I con&s;idering how difficult it would be for me to recover my Money of him there, if not impo&s;&s;ible, re&s;olv'd to accept of his Offer; for tho' he was reputed at <HI>London</HI> to have con&s;iderable Effects in <HI>Maryland,</HI> yet when I came to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> I under&s;tood by &s;ome Ma&s;ters of
<PB N="13" REF="19">
Ve&s;&s;els that came from, and belonged to the Place where he pretended his Effects lay, that he was &s;o far from having any Effects there, that it was the Rever&s;e; for they believed that he was &s;o much in Debt there, that they thought for that Rea&s;on he did not much care to come there; wherefore I was after a &s;ort, as it were, nece&s;&s;itated to accept of his Propo&s;als, for fear of entirely lo&s;ing my Mo|ney; tho' I believe I had obliged my Friends more, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e Gentlemen who were to be concern'd with me, had we proceeded to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and I am &s;ure done my &s;elf more Service to have run the Hazard of lo&s;ing my Money, and come home; as the Sequel hath fully made manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly we pitch'd upon a Sloop that was to be &s;old there; I forget the Gentleman's Name at pre&s;ent that own'd her, neither is it much ma|terial. She was then call'd the <HI>Margaret,</HI> and the then Ma&s;ter's Name was <HI>Alexander Fi&s;her;</HI> &s;he was about 60 Tun of Cask, indifferently well found for tho&s;e Parts, and by the Regi&s;ter &s;he was be|tween 4 and 5 Years old, and was an extraordi|nary Penny-worth. I was di&s;charg'd by Captain <HI>Scott</HI> from the <HI>King Sagamore April</HI> the 24th, 1722, and the &s;ame Day took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sloop; and being oblig'd to regi&s;ter her anew, the old Regi&s;ter Certificate being pretty much torn, and the Property now altered, accordingly a new Regi&s;ter Certificate was taken out in Captain <HI>Scott</HI>'s Name, and al&s;o that of Mr. <HI>George John&s;on,</HI> a Mer|chant who then lived at <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> after which, I &s;hipped Hands and began to get things ready as fa&s;t as I could; but found Captain <HI>Scott</HI> very backward to furni&s;h me with Money towards the fitting of her out, or for a Cargo; however I made &s;hift to rubalong, and what I could not have of Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> I pieced out with the little Mo|ney I rai&s;ed there. I often asked him to come
<PB N="14" REF="20">
to an Account, that we might &s;ettle our Affairs; but he &s;till put me off from time to time with one Excu&s;e or another: However we concluded and agreed uponthe Voyage which was for me to go to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and thence to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands to trade, or only to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, as I thought proper; but the Cargo was all that re|main'd in Di&s;pute: However Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> did put in a &s;mall Quota namely 30 Bu&s;hels of Maiz, 4 Hog&s;heads of Rum, and then he fell &s;ick, and got up in the Country: However I made &s;hift as well as I could, and had &s;ome Corn, Rice, Flower, &amp;c. put on board of me by &s;ome Gentlemen who rather than I &s;hould be baulk'd, were re&s;olved to venture with me; and I was to make them &s;uch Returns, if I &s;ucceeded, as I thought might be rea&s;onable. I likewi&s;e purcha&s;ed what Rum I was able, as al&s;o Sugar, Tobacco, &amp;c. and in &s;hort, one way or another, I got together a pretty Car|go, &s;ufficient to have an&s;wered my De&s;ign, if it had plea&s;ed God that I had e&s;caped the Pirates; as in the Sequel of the Story you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>By this time Captain <HI>Scott</HI>'s Ship was ready for &s;ailing, and he under&s;tanding what Goods I had on board, offered to barter &s;ome of his Goods that would an&s;wer at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> in lieu of &s;ome of my Goods which would an&s;wer where he was intend|ed to go; provided I would alter my Voyage and go to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> which I did not approve of, and &s;o there was no more &s;aid on that Head. We were both ready to &s;ail, and I urged him to come to an Account, which he &s;aid was then impo&s;&s;ible; but as we had agreed to keep Company together till we came in the Latitude of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, &s;o we &s;hould have time enough to &s;ettle before we parted; and abundance of &s;uch like Di&s;cour&s;es: Be&s;ides he &s;aid, he could not yet hold a Pen in his Hand by means of his late Sickne&s;s.
<PB N="15" REF="21">
Having no other Remedy, I was forc'd to acquie&s;ce, he promi&s;ing me, to make me a Bill of Sale not only in Proportion to the Debt he owed me, but, if I had a Mind, he would make me an A&s;&s;ign|ment of the whole Bill of Sale, and pay him when I thought fit.</P>
<P>So we concluded to &s;ail together the next Day, which accordingly we did, being about the mid|dle of <HI>July</HI> 1722, and were to keep Company together till we arrived in the Latitude of the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> I&s;lands, which I was de&s;irous of, on two Accounts; fir&s;t, that I might have an Opportunity of &s;ettling Accounts between us, and al&s;o to have a Con&s;ignment made over to me of a Part of the Sloop in Proportion to the Debt, which would have been for Half the Sloop at lea&s;t. The other Rea&s;on was, I was apprehen|&s;ive of &s;ome Pirates which we had an Account of at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> that lay lurking about the <HI>Cari|bees.</HI></P>
<P>We had a fre&s;h Trade-Wind, con&s;idering the Time of Year, about the North-Ea&s;t and by North, with &s;ome Squalls of Wind and Rain; I was indi&s;|po&s;ed before I &s;ailed from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with a Deje|ction of the Spirits, Faintne&s;s, and Want of Appe|tite, which might be occa&s;ion'd by my fretting and vexing at my Di&s;appointments. I had the Advice of &s;ome Gentlemen of the Faculty of Phy&s;ick there, who ordered me what they thought proper, and withal told me, as I al&s;o believed and hoped, that the fre&s;h Air of the Sea would carry off my Indi&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The <HI>King Sagamore</HI> and I kept Company three Days; and about half an Hour pa&s;t 6 in the Even|ing the third Day, came on a taut Squall of Wind and Rain which &s;plit my Main-&s;ail at the Head, in&s;omuch that I was forc'd to lower it down; and the Ship keeping on her Way, I lo&s;t Sight of her

in that Squall, which continued 'till duski&s;h. We were then got clear of the I&s;lands, and Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> as I &s;uppo&s;e, concluded that he was clear of the Pirates, which we had had an Account of at <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> which, with &s;ome other Rea&s;ons, I believe, might be the Cau&s;e why he did not &s;horten Sail for me when my Main-&s;ail &s;plit, but made the be&s;t of his Way; neither was I much concern'd then, not doubting but I &s;hould meet with him at &s;ome of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, where he de&s;ign'd to Trade, and, as I &s;uppos'd, might be another Rea&s;on of his making the be&s;t of his Way to get to the I&s;lands before me; for he knew that I had Goods in for the&s;e I&s;lands, tho' my De&s;ign was, if Winds and Weather permit|ted, to touch on the Windward Part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> about the <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> before I came to the I&s;lands, and did not much doubt but to have been at the I&s;lands time enough to have done my Bu&s;ine&s;s with Captain <HI>Scott</HI> before he left the I&s;lands; my Sloop &s;ailing much better than his Ship, e&s;pecially on a Wind, which, in cro&s;&s;ing the Trade, is a great Advantage: But my Illne&s;s encrea&s;ed after I came out to Sea, which was contrary to what I expected, as well as to the Opinion of the Doctors; in&s;omuch, that after &s;truggling with it as much and as long as I could, I was at la&s;t forc'd to keep my Bed ten Days with a Fever, accompanied with exce&s;|&s;ive cold, clammy Sweats, with Faintings; after which, growing better, as &s;oon as I was able to keep an Account of the Ve&s;&s;el's Way, I demand|ed of my Mate the Latitude and Longitude we we were got into by his Account, which he gave me; which, upon Peru&s;al, made me conjecture that we were not got &s;o far to the <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> as his Account made out; wherefore I requir'd his Log-Book, to &s;ee how far that might agree with
<PB N="17" REF="23">
his general Account; for &s;ometimes the be&s;t of Men may make a Mi&s;take, either in tran&s;cribing their Day's Work, by mi&s;placing of a Figure, or even by an Error or Mi&s;take in the Working; all the&s;e Mi&s;takes a Man may be overtaken with, and any one of them may lead one &s;o far out of the Truth, as may not only be a Di&s;appointment to his Expectation, but of evil Con&s;equence to Ship, Cargo, and even our very Lives; by which it is ea&s;y to gue&s;s, how careful and circum&s;pect that Man ought to be, that takes upon him the Charge of navigating a Ship at Sea, when the only mi&s;placing of one Figure, may put the Ship and Cargo in danger of being lo&s;t, as well as the Lives of all tho&s;e who at the &s;ame Time are on Board.</P>
<P>I took the Pains to work every Day's Work apart, and made Allowance, as u&s;ual, for what I found Diurnally noted in his Logg-Book; which although it be not &s;o exact as a Man could account for, were he Daily to ob&s;erve the &s;everal Occurrences as they then happen, and allow for, and rectify according to his Judgment, while they are fre&s;h in Mind; yet it is &s;omething more &s;atis|factory, than to take a general and &s;ummed up Account; as any Man who has had the Expe|rience of keeping an Account of a Ship's Way, can ea&s;ily perceive: There were about 14 Leagues Difference between what I made out, as I took it out of his Logg-Book, and the general Account he fir&s;t gave me, he being &s;o much to the Ea&s;t|ward of what he made out by his Logg-Book; which farther confirmed me in my Opinion, that we were not &s;o far to the Ea&s;tward, as he reckon'd we were.</P>
<P>We had light Gales, and &s;ometimes Calms, after we were got to the Northward of the Trade, with heavy Showers of Rain, which is u&s;ual a$

After we were in the Latitude, I run down We&s;t by Day, and lay to by Night; for though I had a good Ob&s;ervation two or three Times every 24 Hours by the Stars, and &s;ometimes a Meridian Ob&s;er|vation by the Sun, yet I would not venture to run in the Night, for fear of mi&s;&s;ing the I&s;land, by rea&s;on the Weather was &s;ometimes hazy, &s;ometimes overca&s;t, and a taut Gale of Wind from the Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, to the South-Ea&s;t, and South-South-Ea&s;t. I run down about 100 Leagues We&s;t, without making any of the I&s;lands; and then concluding, as good Rea&s;on I had, that we were to the We&s;tward of the I&s;lands, I had no other Remedy le&s;t, but to &s;tand to the North|ward

I &s;tood to the Northward with a very hard Gale of Wind at South-South-Ea&s;t, with Rain and a very deep hollow Sea, which held for about four Days; after which the Wea|ther being more moderate, I &s;tood to 31 Degrees 30 Minutes of North Latitude, and then run my Ea&s;ting out, and &s;o bent my Cour&s;e to the South|ward, till we got into the Latitude of the I&s;le of <HI>Sal</HI> again, without meeting with any Thing worth noting here: I then bore away We&s;t till we made the I&s;land, and it being green Trutle Sea&s;on, I &s;tretched in, and anchored in a Road under the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land called <HI>Palmera,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e &s;o called, from the Date-trees growing there, in the Valley in the Southermo&s;t Bay. The Road of <HI>Palmera</HI> in &s;ome Places is very foul and rocky, but if you turn up into the Northermo&s;t Bay, you may anchor there in three or four fathom Water, in clear &s;andy Ground; and with|out that Depth, it is all foul and rocky Ground.

<P>In about two Hours after the Boat went a&s;hore, &s;he came off, and brought a green Turtle which might weigh, I believe, between Two and Three hundred Weight, and al&s;o a Black, being a Native of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s I&s;land, who told me, that his Companions a&s;hore &s;ent me that Turtle which the Boat brought off, as a Pre&s;ent; and that there were about 60 Per&s;ons Natives of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who were brought hither in a Sloop belonging to a Place, the Name of which he could not remember.

Next Morning I went a&s;hore, and they all came about me that were in the Bay, which were eight Men and two Women, one of them having a young Child; for when they began to be out of hopes of the Sloop's coming again, they &s;epa|rated into Companies, and each Company went to a &s;everal Bay, for the greater Conveniency of living; for were they all to &s;tay in one Place, they could not &s;o well &s;upply their Wants, all their Food being then what Fi&s;h they daily catched. There being, as I ob&s;erved before, 11 Souls at this Bay of <HI>Palmera,</HI> they begg'd that I would give them a Pa&s;&s;age to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and they would give me all their Shell, Oil, and part of their dry'd Turtle, to carry them and the other Part of their dry'd Turtle, to St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> I an&s;wer'd, as the Day before, that I would meddle with none of the Goods till I had been at St. <HI>Ni|cholas,</HI> to under&s;tand the Right of the Story; and if in ca&s;e that the Sloop which brought them hither was gone, or had come to any Di&s;a&s;ter, as it was very likely, we &s;hould hear &s;omething of it there, and they need not much fear, but that I &s;hould come up again to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> and carry them down to St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> but then I &s;hould expect as they had offered me now; to wit, all the Turtle, Oil, Turtle-&s;hell, and half the dry'd Turtle. They &s;aid, they were &s;ure every-body would be very glad to agree to that now, without giving my&s;elf any farther Trouble. But I not know|ing upon what Terms they were &s;ent there, and what might be the Rea&s;on of the Sloop's tarrying &s;o long, and not being willing to di&s;appoint any Man, not knowing what Charges the Man might have been at in relation to them, and the little Credit that is to be given to any Thing that tho&s;e Blacks &s;ay, made me re&s;olve not to meddle with any Thing till I heard farther of the Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="29">
I told them, if any of them wanted to go down to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> I would carry them for nothing, but would not carry off any of the Effects; and that I was re|&s;olved to &s;ail that Evening: upon which they told me, that they &s;hould not have Time to &s;end to their Comrades who were in the other Bays; but if I plea&s;ed to give them their Pa&s;&s;age, and Liberty to carry a little dry'd Turtle with them for Food, they &s;hould be very thankful: Which I granted, and &s;o &s;ix Men and the two Women, and a little Child, agreed to go, and two Old Men &s;tayed on the I&s;land, and promi&s;ed to &s;end the re&s;t Word as &s;oon as they could, of what had happened, and the great Likelihood of their good Fortune to get Home in a &s;hort Time, &amp;c. I ordered tho&s;e who de&s;igned to go with me to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to get them&s;elves ready, and al&s;o to bring the Turtle they de&s;igned to carry with them for the Voyage, down to the Water-&s;ide, that it might be put on board: This they readily com|ply'd with, and brought down as much as the Boat could carry at twice, which I ordered on board, and they would have brought more, but I would not permit them; So on board I came, and brought off with me a live green Turtle, which the Blacks had catched the Night before; and after Dinner I &s;ent my Boat a&s;hore to bring them off, which they immediately did to the Number of &s;ix Men, two Women, and a &s;ucking Infant. About 7 a Clock in the Afternoon we weighed from <HI>Palmera,</HI> and &s;teer'd away for the I&s;land of St. <HI>Ni|cholas;</HI> and after we got clear from under the Lee of the Land, which might be about 10 a Clock at Night, we had a plea&s;ant fre&s;h Gale, and by Day-dawning we were off of the Ea&s;t-Point of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> but after we got under the Lee of the I&s;land, it being high &s;teep Land, with a great many deep Gullies, we met with &s;uch hard
<PB N="24" REF="30">
Squalls of Wind coming down tho&s;e Gullies, that it was 9 at Night before I could get to an An|chor; which I did in a Road at the We&s;t-End of the I&s;land, called <HI>Trefall Road,</HI> in about 6 Fathom Water.</P>
<P>Next Morning the Prie&s;t, who was a Native of <HI>Portugal,</HI> came down from their Town, and I &s;ent the Boat a&s;hore for him: Who told me, when he came on board, That he had &s;ent the Sloop to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal</HI> with the Blacks; and that the Sloop was all his own, he having bought her from the Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Name was <HI>James Peer,</HI> living at <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and that he had &s;ent her to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal</HI> with the Blacks to make Turtle, &s;ome of which were his own Slaves, the re&s;t being hired, &s;ome at two Dollars, &s;ome three, and other &s;ome at four Dollars <HI>per</HI> Month; and that all the Turtle, Oil, Shell, &amp;c. that they had made, was intirely his; and that his Sloop had been here at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> &s;ince &s;he came la&s;t from the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> and he had &s;ent her to trade at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and the other I&s;lands to the Leeward, and that &s;he was to be back again in three Weeks or a Month at farthe&s;t: That it was now almo&s;t 3 Months &s;ince he &s;ent her away, and, therefore, was afraid &s;he was come to &s;ome Accident, or el&s;e blown off from the I&s;lands, they having had two or three <HI>Travadoes</HI> &s;ince &s;he went. He al&s;o offered to freight me to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> to bring off the Effects and Men, the Turtle Sea&s;on being in a manner over, and their remaining upon that I&s;land, being now only an Expence to him, without any farther View of making much more Profit this Sea&s;on. He added, that he did not much fear his Sloop's being &s;afe; but as it might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome time before &s;he could arrive to tran&s;port his People from the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> he would gladly agree on rea&s;onable Terms to freight me thither;
<PB N="25" REF="31">
and if not, he mu&s;t e'en wait the coming of his own Sloop. I told him, if I undertook the Mat|ter, I would not be unrea&s;onable; but as yet I was not re&s;olv'd whether to go to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> or not; but was de&s;igned in the Evening, or the next Morning, if the Weather proved moderate, to weigh my Anchor, and turn up into <HI>Paraghee&s;i Road,</HI> and then I would re&s;olve him.</P>
<P>Now the Blacks which I had brought from the I&s;le of <HI>Sal</HI> told me, that the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicho|las,</HI> as al&s;o all the Windward I&s;lands of the Cape <HI>de Verd,</HI> were in great Want of Povi&s;ions; and that the Famine had raged &s;o at this I&s;land, in particu|lar, that within the la&s;t 12 Months, there died no le&s;s than 500 Souls purely for want of Food, the Famine having been for &s;everal Years pa&s;t at the other Windward I&s;lands; but altho' St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> had groaned under it but one Year, yet it was vi&s;ited the &s;evere&s;t of all the I&s;lands during the Time that it held. Now this was the Rea&s;on why I re|&s;olved for <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> becau&s;e it was nigher their Town, and for the mo&s;t part a level Way (which is very rare in tho&s;e I&s;lands, they being generally very &s;teep and rocky) my Intent being to truck or barter away &s;ome of my Corn, Rice, &amp;c. with the Inhabitants, in Exchange for Cot|ton-Cloths (&s;uch as we trade with on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney,</HI> called by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and from them by the <HI>Blacks, Barrafools)</HI> likewi&s;e for Ambergree&s;e, Dragons-blood, Money, &amp;c. the Road of <HI>Trefall</HI> where I lay, not being &s;o convenient for Trading, by rea&s;on of its Di&s;tance from the Town, which was about 16 or 18 Miles, and that being a rocky Way, with very high and &s;teep A&s;cents and De&s;cents.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;t went a&s;hore in the Afternoon, as al&s;o did &s;ome of the Blacks which I brought from the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> and went up to Town; and under|&s;tanding
<PB N="26" REF="32">
that I de&s;igned for <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> they de|&s;ired that I would let their Turtle remain on board till the Ve&s;&s;el came there, which I did.</P>
<P>Next Morning I weighed from <HI>Trefall,</HI> and got up to <HI>Paraghee&s;i</HI> about 9 a Clock that Forenoon, and Anchored in the <HI>Old Road</HI> in 6 fathom Water; the Rea&s;on why I did not go into <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> was, be|cau&s;e the Blacks I had on Board, informed me, that if I went in there (it being a little narrow Gut be|tween 2 Rocky Points; and tho' there was Water enough for any Ship, in&s;omuch that Ve&s;&s;els might moor clo&s;e to the Rock with one Anchor off, and might even moor by Shore-fa&s;ts without any Anchor out, yet it lying &s;o clo&s;e to the Rock, that you might &s;tep from that on board, and from on board to Shore) I &s;hould be &s;o pe&s;ter'd with the Inhabitants, when they came to hear I had Provi|&s;ions to &s;ell, that I &s;hould never be able keep my Ve&s;&s;el clear of them; and, perhaps, the greate&s;t Number of them that would flock on board, would be poor, and unable to do any Thing but beg or &s;teal; whereas, as I lay off at an Anchor, there could none come on Board but &s;uch as I thought fit to bring off in my Boat, and then I need not be troubled with any, but tho&s;e who brought &s;omething with them to trade.</P>
<P>I approved and made u&s;e of their Advice; however, few or none came down be&s;ides the Prie&s;t, and tho&s;e who waited upon him, or were his Followers; whether it was becau&s;e I did not moor in the Harbour, or that the Prie&s;t prevented them, for fear it &s;hould hinder my agreeing with him to go to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> I am not able to de|termine; however, I was willing to lay hold of the Frieght offered, for fear his Sloop &s;hould come, being &s;atisfied I &s;hould have Time enough to make my Market at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> after my Re|turn from the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> which would not take
<PB N="27" REF="33">
up above a Week's time if no Accident happened: be&s;ides I did not fear any Ve&s;&s;el coming with Provi&s;ions to &s;poil my Market, by rea&s;on it was the wrong Time of the Year, being the Sea&s;on for &s;hifting Winds, and Capt. <HI>Scott,</HI> as I heard, had been there about 10 Days before my Arrival, but could &s;upply them but with very little Provi&s;ions, which was the only Thing they then wanted; and that Captain <HI>Scott</HI> was gone to <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> and &s;o from thence to trade among the Leeward I&s;lands. So the Prie&s;t and I agreed for me to &s;ail to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> and bring off all the People and Effects that belonged to him, or on his Ac|count, and he was to pay me 100 Dollars, and a lu&s;ty &s;tout &s;ound Man Slave, about 30 Years of Age; to be paid and delivered at our Return to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> before any of the Ef|fects brought from the I&s;le of <HI>Sal</HI> were landed; the Prie&s;t al&s;o engaging him&s;elf to go along with me, to make the better Di&s;patch in embarquing the Goods from that I&s;land.</P>
<P>So I concluded to weigh Anchor from <HI>Para|ghee&s;i</HI> next Morning, and turn up to <HI>Curri&s;al,</HI> a Road lying on the South-Ea&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land, being very commodious for Watering; the fre&s;h Water running down to the Sea; where I re|&s;olved to recruit my Store of Water and Wood, which was almo&s;t &s;pent; the Prie&s;t promi&s;ing to meet me there the next Morning, with &s;ome Blacks to a&s;&s;i&s;t my Men in that Work. Accordingly next Morning I weighed before Day, and got up and Anchored in <HI>Curri&s;al Road</HI> before Noon; where, according to Promi&s;e, the Prie&s;t met me with four Blacks. We were not long a Watering, the Water being, as I ob&s;erved &s;o nigh the Sea&s;ide; but the Wood was a long Way to fetch, and over &s;teep Rocks, &s;o that if it had not been for the Blacks A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I believe my own Men would
<PB N="28" REF="34">
not have been able to have found it, or to get it down when found. The la&s;t Turn of Wood we got on board about 11 a Clock at Night, and it proving Calm in the Road, I could not weigh An|chor that Night as I de&s;igned. The Prie&s;t, with his 4 Blacks, being Sea-&s;ick, lay a&s;hore on the Sand all Night according to their De&s;ire; and if I &s;aw an Opportunity of weighing, I was to &s;end the Boat for them. He had &s;ent &s;ome other Blacks while we were Wooding and Watering, to hunt for wild Goats, who brought in two, whereof he &s;ent me one on board.</P>
<P>Next Morning, about Dawning, as it was my u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, I turned out, it continuing &s;till Calm; and as the Day broke out, looking about, I e&s;py'd three Sail of Ships off the Bay, one Ship to the Ea&s;tward, another Ship to the We&s;tward, and the Third right off the Middle of the Bay; the fir&s;t of them that I made plain with my Gla&s;s was the Ea&s;twardmo&s;t Ship, which &s;eemed to be a full-built and loaden Ship, and I took the re&s;t to be the &s;ame, and of her Company, and imagin'd that, perhaps, they might want Water, &amp;c&punc; They had but very little Wind in the Offing, and it continued &s;till Calm in the Bay. I &s;aw them bring to, then edge away, but could not perceive any Signals made by them; and &s;eeing them act thus, I &s;till continued in my fir&s;t Opinion, that they wanted to touch at the I&s;land for Wood, Water, &amp;c. but that, perhaps, they might be unac|quainted with the Roads or Harbours of the I&s;land; in&s;omuch that I was almo&s;t of the Mind to &s;end my Mate off with the Boat to conduct them in.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Day broke up clear, that they made me, the Middlemo&s;t of the three &s;tood right in for me, and as the Sun ro&s;e, the Wind fre&s;hened and backed more to the Ea&s;tward, as is
<PB N="29" REF="35">
u&s;ual there after calm Nights. As &s;he drew nigh|er, I made her with my Gla&s;s to be a Scooner, and full of Hands, all in their white Shirts, and likewi&s;e I &s;aw a whole Tier of Great Guns; and then, indeed, I began to &s;u&s;pect what they were: But I had no Remedy but patiently to wait the Event, for I could do nothing, except I put the Ve&s;&s;el a&s;hore, which would have been meer Madne&s;s to have done, altho' I had been &s;ure they were Pirates; and I was &s;o &s;urrounded by them, that there was no Po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping from them, and e&s;pecially, it holding calm within the Bay; and they coming in with the Day-Breeze, came in as fa&s;t as the Wind. He came in under an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> En&s;ign, Jack, and Pendant, and as &s;oon as I perceiv'd his Colours, I hoi&s;ted my En&s;ign; he had eight Guns, and &s;ix Patte|reroes, and &s;eventy Men. He &s;tretch'd a-head of us, and haled us; I an&s;wer'd him: He ask'd, <HI>Where the Sloop belong'd to?</HI> I an&s;wer'd, <HI>To</HI> Lon|don. He ask'd, <HI>From whence we came?</HI> I told him, <HI>From</HI> Barbadoes. He &s;aid, <HI>It was very well; he knew that;</HI> and &s;o brought to a-head of us, and bid me &s;end my Boat on Board of him; which accordingly I did, with two Hands in her, and I my &s;elf kept walking on the Deck. The Captain of the Scooner, who&s;e Name was <HI>John Lopez,</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> (as I was told after|wards; but then went by the Name of <HI>John Ru&s;|&s;el,</HI> pretending, tho' fal&s;ely, that he was born in the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts of <HI>England)</HI> ask'd the People who came on Board of him with the Boat, <HI>Where the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop was?</HI> who an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he was on Board, and &s;ent them with the Boat to know what they wanted.</HI> He ask'd them, <HI>Which was the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop?</HI> So they &s;hew'd me to him as I was walking the Sloop's Deck, and then he immediately call'd to me, &s;aying, <HI>You</HI>

<HI>Dog! you Son of a B&mdash;! you &s;peckled-Shirt Dog!</HI> (for I had a &s;peckled Holland Shirt on, and was Slip-&s;hoe'd, and without Stockings, being ju&s;t as I turn'd out of my Cabin) So he &s;till continued calling in that Manner, and I con&s;idering what Hands I was fallen into, and that it would be ea&s;ie for them to &s;end a Ball through me for my Silence, which, perhaps, they might deem Con|tempt of them, as indeed it was, I thought it was the &s;afe&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e, to an&s;wer, ac|cording to the Proverb, <HI>When your Hand is in the Lion's Mouth, get it out as ea&s;ie as you can,</HI> and not, in the lea&s;t, to &s;eem to re&s;ent any thing that they &s;aid, or did to me, but endeavour to &s;ubmit, if not with a willing Mind, yet with a &s;eeming Patience, as, in truth, I could do no otherwi&s;e, except I would, with a fooli&s;h Ra&s;hne&s;s, provoke them to be my Executioners; and, God knows, a &s;mall Provocation, nay, if they do but conceit it &s;o, will occa&s;ion the taking any hone&s;t Man's Life away. So I an&s;wer'd him, <HI>Ho lo:</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>You Dog, you, why did not you come on Board with the Boat, you Son of a B&mdash;? I will drub you, you Dog, within an Inch of your Life, and that Inch too.</HI> I made him An&s;wer, <HI>That he only com|manding the Boat on Board, I did not think he re|quired me; but if he plea&s;ed to &s;end the Boat, I would come and wait upon him on Board.</HI> He an|&s;wer'd, <HI>Ay, you Dog, and I will teach you better Manners.</HI> Upon this, he order'd &s;ome of the Pirates into my Boat, to fetch me, as al&s;o eight or ten more of them, to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sloop mean while; which accordingly was done, and I came along Side of the Scooner. The Captain of her &s;till continued to threaten me with drubbing, <HI>to teach me better Manners than &s;o to affront him.</HI> I an&s;wer'd, <HI>I did not de&s;ign to af|front him, or any of the Company.

The lea&s;t I expected was a &s;ound drubbing Bout, and I had abundance of Rea&s;on to apprehend even wor&s;e than that, he &s;till con|tinuing to threaten what he would do to me when I came in: But a Man in a Gold Laced Hat, whom afterwards I under&s;tood to be the Gunner, looked over the Side, as I was coming up, and &s;aid, <HI>Come up, Ma&s;ter, you &s;hall not he abu&s;ed.</HI> After I got in, the Captain up with his Cutla&s;h, as tho' he was going to cleave me down, and &s;aid, <HI>You Dog, you, what was the Rea&s;on you did not come on board when the Boat fir&s;t came? What do you think you de&s;erve?</HI> I an&s;wered, <HI>If I had done ami&s;s, it was through Ignorance, and for want of knowing better; and hoped that he would excu&s;e this my Fault, I not knowing who or what they were.</HI> Then he rapped out an Oath, with a <HI>Damn you, you Dog, what, or who do you think we are?</HI> I pau&s;ed a while, not well knowing what An&s;wer to make, for fear of offending them again; for one di&s;plea&s;ing Word is as much as the be&s;t Man in the World's Life is worth, while in their Clutches.

I had been once taken by Pirates before, coming from <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> when I was a Youth, but I did not then think it proper to take notice of it to them, but the Rever&s;e; and thought it the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e at pre&s;ent, to pretend Ignorance, as the only Way to appea&s;e his unmerited, though dan|gerous and threatning Wrath.)

<P><HI>By this Time the Prie&s;ts and the Blacks, mi&s;|tru&s;ting how the Game went, were got a pretty Way up the Rocks, in order to e&s;cape into the Mountains, which the Pirates ob&s;erving, Captain</HI> Ru&s;&s;el <HI>asked me,</HI> If I knew who tho&s;e People were? <HI>I not knowing but the &s;ame Que&s;tion might have been asked of &s;ome of my People, and that, perhaps, they might have told them, and not being willing, and, indeed, I may &s;ay, not daring, to be caught in a Lye, ingenuou&s;ly told them the Truth, and &s;aid,</HI> They were the Prie&s;t, and &s;ome Blacks with him, who were to have gone with me to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> if I had not thus met with them. <HI>He then asked,</HI> What we were to have done at the I&s;le of <HI>Sal? So I told him the Occa&s;ion, and al&s;o of the Bargain which I had made with him on that Head. He &s;aid,</HI> The Prie&s;t would never &s;ee his Sloop more. <HI>I asked him,</HI> If he heard any thing of her? <HI>He &s;aid</HI> Yes, they had taken her, and their own Gang, that they had put on board of her, ran away with her, with a Booty of Eight hundred Pounds in Money, be&s;ides other Goods; <HI>and al&s;o he &s;aid,</HI> He had an Account of me, and what Cargo I brought out of <HI>Barba|does,</HI> and that, in all Probability, I was then ar|rived at St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> which Information, and al&s;o that the Prie&s;t and Governor of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> had a pretty large Bag of Dollars, which each of them had boarded up, was the only Occa&s;ion of their coming here: otherwi&s;e, if they had not received this Information, they were de&s;igned to have gone directly from the I&s;land of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> after they

had cleaned and fitted their Ve&s;&s;els, on their intend|ed Enterprize.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I could not imagine who could give him that Information of me, for that I had hardly communicated my De&s;ign of touching at the&s;e I&s;lands to any, that I thought was or could be liable to fall into their Hands, except one Per&s;on. <HI>He told me,</HI> It was one that came out in Company with me from <HI>Barbadoes; and to be &s;hort, &s;aid,</HI> it was Captain <HI>Scot</HI> told them, and how that all the Sloop was his, and he had filled my Hold full of Sugar, Rum, &amp;c. and that he was &s;ure I was, by this Time, arrived at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> St. <HI>Antonia,</HI> or &s;ome of the Windward I&s;lands, unle&s;s I was run away with his Sloop and Cargo; and likewi&s;e that he had &s;een, when he was la&s;t a Trading at St. <HI>Ni|cholas,</HI> both the Prie&s;t's and Governor's Money, which, as he reported to them, he was certain, neither of them could have le&s;s than <HI>1600,</HI> or <HI>2000</HI> Dollars apiece. <HI>So I asked them,</HI> How it was with Captain <HI>Scot? They told me,</HI> He was but indif|ferent yet, they thought he was better than he de|&s;erved; and told me how they had burnt his Ship, and that he had been put a&s;hore by them at <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> where they believed he at pre&s;ent was.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;el <HI>&s;till eyeing the Prie&s;t and Blacks, asked me,</HI> If I thought it was po&s;&s;ible to go a&s;hore and catch them? <HI>I told him,</HI> I thought not. <HI>He asked me,</HI> Why? For, he had Men on board could out-walk or out-run them, he was &s;ure. <HI>I told him,</HI> I believed not; for before his Boat could put a&s;hore, they would be got two or three Miles up in|to the Country, and that the Way there was &s;o &s;teep and rocky, that I was &s;ure his Men could not climb up, much le&s;s pretend to catch them. <HI>He an&s;wer|ed,</HI> It did not &s;ignify much; for he would have him, <HI>meaning the Prie&s;t,</HI> and &s;ome more of them, before this Time to-morrow; <HI>and asked me,</HI> Which

was the nighe&s;t Anchoring-place to the Town? <HI>And al&s;o</HI> from which Anchoring-place was the &s;moothe&s;t Path or Road up to it? <HI>I told him,</HI> I did not know for certain; neither was I any-ways ac|quainted on the I&s;land, having never been half a Quarter of a Mile up from the Sea-&s;ide, on any Part of it. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> I might have heard from the Inhabitants. <HI>I told him,</HI> I did hear &s;ome of the Inhabitants &s;ay, that the Road of <HI>Paraghee&s;i</HI> was the nighe&s;t Anchoring-place to the Town, of all the Roads about the I&s;land; but what &s;ort of Path|way it was up to Town, I had not &s;o exactly in|quired, as to be able to &s;atisfy him in that. Well, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, we will go to <HI>Paraghee&s;i;</HI> and, <HI>&s;ays he to me,</HI> you &s;hall pilot us thither. <HI>I told him,</HI> I never had been there, and did not know, but there might be &s;unken Rocks in the Way; and, therefore, thought my&s;elf very unqualified to take Charge of the Ve&s;&s;el thither; but, <HI>I told him,</HI> there were two Blacks on board the Sloop, both Natives and Fi&s;hermen of that I&s;land; and that one of them was my Pilot, and might be, as far as I knew, very capable to pilot their Ve&s;&s;el into the Road; or, perhaps, might di&s;cover to them &s;ome more conve|nient Place to anchor or land at. <HI>Upon this, he &s;wore and damn'd, &s;aying,</HI> What! do you think I will let a Negro pilot me? No, no; <HI>but &s;wore</HI> I &s;hould pilot the Ve&s;&s;el into an Anchoring-place, and &s;tand clear if the lea&s;t Accident happened to her. <HI>I told him,</HI> I would do as well as I could, and that I had acquainted him already of my little Knowledge of the I&s;land. Well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> do as well as you can: Do as you would do, was it your own Ve&s;&s;el. <HI>I told him</HI> I would: Well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we de&s;ire you to do no more; <HI>and immediately he gave Orders to make the be&s;t of our Way down to</HI> Para|ghee&s;i, <HI>which accordingly was done; and the Pi|rates on board my Sloop &s;lipped the Cable, be|cau&s;e</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="43">
<HI>they would not take the Pains to weigh the Anchor, and &s;o, through Sloth and Lazine&s;s, left a good Cable and Anchor behind.</HI></P>
<P>All this Time, the other two Ships lay too in the Offing, but as &s;oon as they &s;aw us make &s;ail down to Leeward, the <HI>Ro&s;e Pink,</HI> having 36 Guns mounted, commanded by <HI>Edward Loe,</HI> who was then Commodore of them, edged in towards us, upon which we edged off towards him, and &s;poke with him, and <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> gave him an Account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and of his De&s;ign of landing that Evening upon the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> in order to take the Prie&s;t and Governor, if he ap|proved of their Re&s;olution. Which the Commo|dore &s;aid he did, and immediately ordered his great Launch to be mann'd, and &s;ent &s;ome more of his Ship's Company to join and reinforce the Scooner's Crew, and to go a&s;hore with them in the Expedition; which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Then we haled in for the Shore again, and when we were got the Length of <HI>Porto Lappa,</HI> which is a Road, or Bay, lying about Mid|way, or a little more, between <HI>Curri&s;al</HI> and <HI>Pa|raghee&s;i;</HI> one of the Scooner's Company raps out a great Oath, <HI>That that was the be&s;t Place to land at, and the nighe&s;t to the Town;</HI> upon which Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> whom I under&s;tood then to be, not only Captain of the Scooner, but al&s;o Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General of all the Companies, asked me, <HI>If it was as the Fellow &s;aid?</HI> I told him, <HI>I could not tell; it might be &s;o as far as I knew; for all the Knowledge I had as to that, was only by the Relation of the Inhabitants, and there|fore could not be certain my&s;elf, not knowing but they might deceive me in the Relations they made me.</HI> The Fellow &s;wore, <HI>That he knew the Place perfectly well; and that he had landed there be|fore, and was acquainted with the Way up to the</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="44">
<HI>Town:</HI> Upon which, Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> ordered to &s;tand in for the Bay of <HI>Porto Lappa,</HI> and likewi&s;e directed the Gang, that was to go a&s;hore, to have their Arms ready, and every Man to pre|pare &s;o many Rounds of Cartridges, both for Pi&s;tols and Pieces, and to be in a Readine&s;s to embarque in the Boats, as &s;oon as we &s;hould be got nigh enough to the Land. When we came within about half a League of the Shore, the Boats were mann'd by <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Order, who al&s;o went a&s;hore, and headed them, to the Num|ber of 35, be&s;ides tho&s;e which went in the Boats to bring them off again. We were ordered by <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> as &s;oon as the Boats were put off, to make the be&s;t of our Way down to <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> and come to an Anchor, and &s;tay there till farther Orders, and the Boats were to follow us down to the Bay, after they had landed the Men at <HI>Porto Lappa.</HI></P>
<P>All this was accordingly perform'd, and we ca&s;t Anchor in the <HI>Old R$ad,</HI> where I had an|chor'd before in the Sloop; and the Boats, after they had landed the Men, al&s;o came down, and got on board of us about 6 a-Clock that Evening; the two Ships keeping plying off, and on, open with where we lay.</P>
<P>Here we rid all Night, during which, the Commodore kept out a Light, as we al&s;o did to an&s;wer him; and next Day Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> with all his Company, came down to <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> and brought with them as Pri&s;oners, the Prie&s;t, and the old Governor's Son, with five or &s;ix Men|blacks; and upon their haling the Scooner, the Boats were mann'd and &s;ent a&s;hore for them, and they were all brought off together. It was about one a-Clock in the Afternoon when they came on board, and immediately we weighed, and &s;tood off to the Ships, which were then ly|ing
<PB N="39" REF="45">
too in the Offing; and when we were come within Call of the Commodore, he haled us, and asked, <HI>How all fared? And what Luck?</HI> And was an&s;wered by <HI>Ru&s;&s;el, That he would wait on him on board, and give him a full and particular Account.</HI> Accordingly the Launch was forthwith manned, and the Men &s;ent from the Commodore, to join the Scooner's Men, for the Shore Expedition, were ordered to embarque in her, to go on board their own Ship; which being done, I was order|ed al&s;o to get into her, to pre&s;ent my&s;elf, and pay my Re&s;pects to the great Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> their Commodore: Accordingly I went into the Launch, and <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> follow'd us in his own Boat, with the Prie&s;t, and the other Pri&s;oners, which they had brought off the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>When I came on board the <HI>Ro&s;e Pink,</HI> the Company welcomed me on board, and &s;aid, <HI>They were &s;orry for my Lo&s;s; but told me, I mu&s;t go to pay my Re&s;pects to the Captain, who was in the Cabbin, and waited for me.</HI> I was u&s;hered in by an Officer, who, I think, was their Gunner, and who, by his Deportment, acted as though he had been Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies; tho' I do not remember to have heard of &s;uch an Officer or Office mentioned among them, neither do I know whether they are always &s;o formal on Board their Commodore, at the fir&s;t Reception of their captivated Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els. When I came into the Cabbin, the Officer who conducted me thither, after paying his Re&s;pects to the Commo|dore, told him, <HI>That I was the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop which they had taken the Day before,</HI> and then withdrew out of the Cabbin, leaving us two alone.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Loe, <HI>with the u&s;ual Compliment, wel|comed me on board, and told me,</HI> He was very &s;orry for my Lo&s;s, and that it was not his De&s;ire to
<PB N="40" REF="46">
meet with any of his Country-men, but rather with Foreigners, excepting &s;ome few that he wanted to cha&s;ti&s;e for their Roguei&s;hne&s;s, <HI>as he call'd it:</HI> But however, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;ince Fortune has ordered it &s;o, that you have fallen into our Hands, I would have you to be of good Cheer, and not to be ca&s;t down. <HI>I told him,</HI> That I al&s;o was very &s;orry, that it was my Chance to fall into their Way; but &s;till en|couraged my&s;elf in the Hopes, that I was in the Hands of Gentlemen of Honour and Genero&s;ity; it being &s;till in their Power whether to make this their Capture of me, a Misfortune or not. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> It did not lie in his particular Power; for he was but one Man, and all Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Nature, mu&s;t be done in Publick, and by a Majority of Votes by the whole Company; and though neither he, nor, he believed, any of the Company, de&s;ired to meet with any of their own Nation (except &s;ome few Per&s;ons for the Rea&s;ons before-mention'd) yet when they did, it could not well be avoided, but that they mu&s;t take as their own what Providence &s;ent them: And as they were Gentlemen, who entirely depended upon Fortune, they dur&s;t not be &s;o ungrateful to her, as to refu&s;e any Thing which &s;he put into their Way; for if they &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e any of her Favours, tho' never &s;o mean, they might offend her, and thereby cau&s;e her to withdraw her Hand from them; and &s;o, perhaps, they might peri&s;h for want of tho&s;e Things, which in their ra&s;h Folly they &s;lighted. <HI>He then, in a very obliging Tone, de&s;ired me to &s;it down, he him&s;elf all this Time not once moving from his Seat, which was one of the great Guns, though there were Chairs enough in the Cabbin; but I &s;uppo&s;e, he thought he &s;hould not appear &s;o martial, or Hero-like, if he &s;at on a Chair, as he did on a great Gun.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After I had &s;at down, he asked me,</HI> What I would drink? <HI>I thank'd him, and told him,</HI> I did
<PB N="41" REF="47">
not much Care for drinking; but out of a Sen&s;e of the Honour he did me in asking, I would drink any Thing with him which he plea&s;ed to drink. <HI>He told me,</HI> It would not avail me any Thing to be ca&s;t down: It was Fortune of War, and grieving or vexing my&s;elf, might be of no good Con&s;equence in re&s;pect to my Health; be&s;ides, it would be more taking, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> with the Company, to appear brisk, lively, and with as little Concern as I could. And come, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you may, and I hope you will, have better Fortune hereafter. <HI>So ringing the Cabbin|bell, and one of his</HI> Valet de Chambres, <HI>or rather</HI> Valet de Cabins, <HI>appearing, he commanded him to make a Bowl of Punch, in the great Bowl, which was a rich &s;ilver one, and held, I believe, about two Gallons; which being done, he order|ed likewi&s;e &s;ome Wine to be &s;et on the Table, and accordingly two Bottles of Claret were brought; and then he took the Bowl and drank to me in Punch; but bid me pledge him in which I liked be&s;t; which I did in Wine. He told me,</HI> That what he could favour me in, he would, and wi&s;hed that it had been my Fortune to have been taken by them ten Days or a Fortnight &s;ooner; for then, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they had abundance of good Commodi|ties, which they took in <HI>2 Portugueze</HI> outward-bound <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> Men, viz. Cloth, as well Linens as Wool|lens, both fine and coar&s;e, Hats of all &s;orts, Silk, Iron, and other rich Goods in abundance, and be|lieved, he could have prevailed with the Company even to have loaded my Sloop. But now they had no Goods at all, he believed, having di&s;po&s;ed of them all, either by giving them to other Prizes, &amp;c. or heaving the re&s;t into <HI>David Jones's Locker (i. e. the Sea);</HI> but did not know, but it might be his Lot, perhaps, to meet with me again, when it might lie in his Way to make me a Retaliation for my pre&s;ent Lo&s;s; and he did a&s;&s;ure me, that when
<PB N="42" REF="48">
&s;uch an Occa&s;ion, as he was but now a &s;peaking of, offered, I might depend he would not be wanting to &s;erve me in any Thing that might turn to my Ad|vantage, as far as his Power or Intere&s;t could reach. <HI>I could do no le&s;s, in common Civility, and the Truth is, I dared do no le&s;s, than thank him.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time, word was brought into the Cabbin, that the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was come on board, with the Prie&s;t and the other Pri&s;oners, which they had brought off from the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> Captain <HI>Loe</HI> ordered Cap|tain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> the Prie&s;t, and the Governor's Son of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to be called into the great Cabbin, and accordingly they came, and the Cabbin was immediately fill'd with Officers, and &s;ome others of the principal Pirates, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, by their long &s;tanding, or their Activity in Villainy, had &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves for Principals of the Crew; out of whom, as Occa&s;ion &s;erved, they al&s;o cho&s;e their Officers, &amp;c. The Cabbin having been thus filled, <HI>Loe,</HI> after Compliments pa&s;&s;ed, bid <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and the Pri&s;oners &s;it down, and then asked <HI>Ru&s;&s;el, What News? And how the Game went?</HI> Upon which, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> began his Relation, in the&s;e Words, as near as I can remember.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;According to our la&s;t Agreement in Con&s;ul|tation, &s;ays he, we landed with 35 Men, on the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> Ye&s;terday in the Af|ternoon, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly we could after the taking the Sloop, and putting Things in &s;uch Order as was proper; and immediately after our landing, we apprehended two Blacks of the Natives, who were come down to know who we were, and what Account we were up|on, that they might go and acquaint the Go|vernor of us, as they &s;aid. But we retarded their Journey, by making them our Guides, to
<PB N="43" REF="49">
direct and &s;hew us the Way to the Town; and it was well we happened to meet them, for Night coming on, we &s;hould never have found the Way; and be&s;ides, if we had, we &s;hould not have been able, in the Dark, to know whe|ther we were going right or wrong, the Way being, moreover, very rocky, &s;tony, and there being &s;ome very &s;teep, as well as high A&s;cents and De&s;cents; &s;o that if we had not had a Guide, we &s;hould have been &s;o di&s;couraged, as to defer our Journey till the &s;ucceeding Day, which would have balked us; for if we had not got up to Town la&s;t Night, before we were di&s;covered, the Rumour of our coming, would, I believe, have frightened all the Inhabitants out of the Town, and cau&s;ed them to fly to the Mountains, and then we &s;hould have thought that there was a Booty, but that our being di&s;|covered, gave them an Opportunity of con|veying it away. But by our taking tho&s;e Men, we prevented any Rumour or Notice of our coming, and &s;o were a&s;&s;ured there was no Booty there, but what we found. We got to Town about 9 a-Clock at Night, and, by E&s;timation, from the Place of our landing to the Town, was about 12 Miles. We went directly to the Governor's Hou&s;e, and having &s;et a Guard there, to prevent any Body's going out, or in, that there might be no Opportunity of con|veying any Thing out of the Hou&s;e, I took &s;ome Hands with me, and went to the Prie&s;t's Hou&s;e, whom we found not to have been long come home, from <HI>Curri&s;al,</HI> and had not the lea&s;t Thought of our &s;o &s;udden Arrival here, believing it was impo&s;&s;ible that we could reach the Town till the Day following, if we were de&s;igned to come up; neither had he any No|tice of our Arrival before, till his own Eyes
<PB N="44" REF="50">
confirm'd it. But, however, he did not &s;eem to be much &s;urpriz'd. I &s;et a Guard, to prevent any Thing being conveyed out; and the Prie&s;t ordered &s;uch Victuals as he had, to be &s;et on the Table, and Wine enough, and told me, <HI>That he could not entertain us at &s;uch an un&s;ea|&s;onable Time of Night as he would, and hoped we would excu&s;e him for not being better provided, and take the Will for the Deed;</HI> adding, <HI>That to &s;uch as we found, we were very welcome, wi&s;hing it had been better; but if we tarried till next Day,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>we &s;hould be &s;upplied plentifully, with whatever the I&s;land afforded.</HI> Upon which I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I came of an Er|rand, and mu&s;t perform it, which was, That we had a po&s;itive Information, from very good Hands, who had been Eye-witne&s;&s;es, that he, as al&s;o the Governor, had good Store of Dollars, as well as Gold hoarded up, and that we were come to &s;hare it with them, it being one great Branch of our Trade not to let Money lie ru&s;ting and canker|ing in old Bags or Che&s;ts, but to make it move and circulate, whenever we could come at it.</HI> At which, the Prie&s;t, without any apparent Con|cern, replied, <HI>That whoever gave us that Infor|mation, gave a fal&s;e one, as any one might ea&s;ily conceive, if they but gave them&s;elves leave to con|&s;ider how unlikely, nay, he might very well &s;ay, impo&s;&s;ible it was, to get Money in tho&s;e barren, un|cultivated and commercele&s;s I&s;lands.</HI> I told him, <HI>I was Ma&s;ter of but two Sen&s;es that could give me Satisfaction whether the Information was fal&s;e, or what he now &s;aid was true, which were Seeing and Feeling.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>I was welcome to make u&s;e of tho&s;e Sen&s;es to my Satisfaction, which I am &s;ure,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>will then fully confirm the Truth of what I have &s;aid;</HI> and immediately ordered Wax-candles, (they having no other there, and

them only for the U&s;e of the Church, being all con&s;ecrated, and &s;ent thither by the Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;end con&s;ecra|ted Candles, Oil, &amp;c. for the U&s;e of the Church, to all the adjacent I&s;lands) to be lighted; and we &s;earched all the Hou&s;e, Che&s;ts, Trunks, and every where throughout and about the Hou&s;e, and found nothing worth taking, and only about twenty Dollars in Money, which I did not think it worth our while to take from him. From thence I went to the Governor's Hou&s;e, and &s;earch'd there as narrowly as we could, and found le&s;s there; after which I di&s;po&s;ed of my Men as I thought mo&s;t convenient for the repo&s;ing and refre&s;hing them after their fatiguing Journey, but yet with a due Regard withal to our own Security, by &s;etting a Guard, and ordering the re&s;t to repo&s;e as as well as they could, and not one of them to offer to &s;tir out of the Governor's Hou&s;e; and withal giving them a &s;trict Charge to be ready with their Arms at all Calls, and at a Moment's Warning, and not one of them to unarm, or un&s;ling his Pi&s;tols: Which was accordingly ve|ry regularly and orderly performed; and next Morning we concluded, that not having lighted on the Booty according to Information given, or rather the Information being fal&s;e, no &s;uch Booty being there, we had therefore agreed to &s;eize and bring on Board the Governor, Prie&s;t, and four or five be&s;ides, of the principal Inha|bitants for your more ample Satisfaction.</Q></P>

For my part, I am for &s;omething that is worth taking, and if I cannot light with &s;uch, I never will give the World Occa&s;ion to &s;ay I am a poor, pitiful, or mean-&s;pirited Fellow: No, I will rob for &s;omething of Value, or el&s;e will not rob at all, e&s;pecially from the&s;e People among whom we may reckon one of our Places of Refuge in ca&s;e any of us &s;hould be &s;eparated from the Company, or the Company break, &amp;c. and therefore I boldly affirm, that by drawing on us an Odium from the&s;e People for a Trifle, might be of pernicious Con&s;equence to us, and more e&s;pecially, if any of us &s;hould be put to &s;uch Extremities as might happen: For this, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> would by all Men be accounted a narrow-&s;oul'd, mean-&s;pirited Folly, and we &s;hould, to all Futurity, be curs'd by our own Fraternity as often as any of them were pinch'd with the Effects, which would be very likely to follow &s;uch an Over&s;ight.</P>
<P>Hereupon Captain <HI>Loe</HI> interrupting him, re|ply'd, <HI>That what he &s;aid was very true, and car|ry'd abundance of Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on with it, and de&s;ired that he would proceed no farther on that Head;</HI> adding, <HI>That he was &s;atisfied in what he did, and believ'd that there was neither want of Judg|ment or Courage in the Management of it;</HI> but withal

<P>After every one had drank round, Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> rea&s;&s;umed his Tale, and proceeded thus:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> as I told you before, how that we had re&s;olved to bring the Prie&s;t, the Go|vernor, and four or five Blacks on Board, to &s;atis|fie you and the Company, that it was not Fear nor Cowardi&s;e that deterr'd us from obtaining the Booty, which we and you expected to find; &s;o, pur&s;uant to our Re&s;olution, I &s;ent for the Prie&s;t to come to me at the Governor's Hou&s;e; but the Per&s;on I &s;ent, found that he was fled away in the Night, with all his Slaves, &s;aving an old, lame Woman, who told them this. Hereupon I told the Governor, who was a very ancient Negro, <HI>If he did not cau&s;e the Prie&s;t to be brought to me in two Hours time, it &s;hould be the wor&s;e for the Inhabitants of the I&s;land.</HI> The Governor an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he much fear'd it was impo&s;&s;ible to bring him in, by rea&s;on he heard that he was fled, with &s;ome of his Slaves, to the Moun|tains, and that it was very ea&s;y for him to re|main there &s;everal Months, notwith&s;tanding all the Means which he could po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e to di&s;cover him.</HI> He gave an In&s;tance of this in one of the Prie&s;t's Slaves, who formerly had run away from his Ma&s;ter, and notwith&s;tanding the Prie&s;t u&s;ed all manner of Diligence to apprehend him, (and that he could do more that Way than any one) yet that Slave was undi&s;cover'd for near twelve Months, and by mo&s;t People
<PB N="48" REF="54">
thought to be dead: The Governor added, That the &s;ame Slave being with him now, he had, no doubt, thoroughly acquainted his Ma|&s;ter with all the Caverns, Caves, and other Places of Secrecy. Upon which I told him, <HI>If he did not bring him, or cau&s;e him to be brought and deliver'd to me in three Hours time at farthe&s;t, I would, as &s;oon as that Time was expired, burn the Town down to A&s;hes:</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>He lay at my Mercy, and would u&s;e all Diligence to find, and cau&s;e him, if po&s;&s;ible, to be deliver'd to me within the Time limited; but hop'd, that after he had u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavour, if it &s;hould prove fruitle&s;s, that I would be more con&s;iderate than to make the Innocent &s;uffer for the Fault of the Guilty.</HI> I told him, <HI>The Time was &s;et, and I would not defer burning the Town down to the Ground, one Minute after that Time was expired, if the Prie&s;t was not delivered into my Hands.</HI> Then he told me, <HI>He hop'd we would not kill him, nor abu&s;e him in his Per&s;on: As for our Goods,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>them we leave wholly to your Mercy.</HI> I told him, <HI>The Prie&s;t &s;hould not be hurt in his Body, if he came and &s;urrender'd him|&s;elf within the Time limited, and behaved him&s;elf like a Man.</HI> The Governor &s;ent immediately &s;everal Parties of his Blacks in que&s;t of the Prie&s;t; and in the mean time I order'd him to kill an Ox, and dre&s;s it as &s;oon as he could, for my Men, and al&s;o to get a Pipe of Wine, and &s;et it abroach, which he accordingly did. In about two Hours, &s;ome of the Blacks who had been &s;ent out by the Governor in que&s;t of the Prie&s;t, return'd, and brought word, That they had found the Prie&s;t, and &s;ecur'd him from e&s;caping; but he had &s;ent them to de&s;ire the Governor to pray me not to be angry, and heartily to beg my Pardon, being very &s;orry
<PB N="49" REF="55">
that he had given me &s;o much Trouble, and in Affiance on my Goodne&s;s, he would wait upon me, and ca&s;t him&s;elf entirely upon my Mercy. I told the Governor, he might come without Fear, for he &s;hould not be abu&s;ed; upon which he came, and very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively ask'd my Par|don, and hop'd I would not be angry for his be|ing &s;o rude, after I and our Company had be|hav'd our &s;elves &s;o civilly; repenting that he &s;hould be &s;o fooli&s;h as to &s;neak away &s;o, and ab&s;cond, having no Rea&s;on, as he believed, to do &s;o, but his own groundle&s;s Apprehen&s;ions; adding, That he was per&s;waded to it, or el&s;e he &s;hould not have done it of him&s;elf neither. I bid him not be afraid, we would not hurt him, but told him, he had like to have hurt the whole I&s;land by his unadvi&s;ed Ra&s;hne&s;s; for if he had not come as he did, I was re&s;olv'd, as &s;oon as my Men had got their Victuals, to have burn'd the Town down to A&s;hes, Church and all. He &s;aid, <HI>He thank'd God that he was, he hop'd, come Time enough to &s;ave it, and thank'd me for my Clemency in deferring it &s;o long.</HI> I told him, it was very well, and bid him &s;it down, which he did, and &s;ent to his Hou&s;e for Wine, Fowls, and an Anchor of Rum, which were brought, and we made our &s;elves very merry, eat and drank heartily, kept Open Hou&s;e, and treated all the Natives that came to us; the greate&s;t Part having taken Ex|ample by the Prie&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, and fled out to the Mountains for fear of us, tho' my De|&s;ign was not to hurt any of them, while they continued civil.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>&startq;After we had eaten and drank, and &s;ufficient|ly refre&s;hed our &s;elves, I told the Prie&s;t and Governor,</HI> That they and &s;ix more whom I &s;hould choo&s;e, mu&s;t go on Board the Commadore. <HI>The</HI>

<HI>Prie&s;t &s;eem'd to be much &s;urprized at this News, and told me,</HI> That he hoped we would not carry them quite away from the I&s;land, nor make Slaves of them. <HI>Upon which I told him,</HI> I was a Ro|man-Catholick as well as he; neither &s;hould there be any Harm done to him, nor any of them that went with him; and that they &s;hould only go on Board the Commadore, and &s;atisfie him that the Information which he had of their having &s;o much Money, was fal&s;e. <HI>At which he &s;eem'd to be very well contented, and accordingly we came down and got on Board.

<P>Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> having thus ended his Relation, Captain <HI>Loe</HI> &s;aid, <HI>He had done very well,</HI> and ask'd the Prie&s;t &s;everal Que&s;tions, after which, he directed them to be put on Board the Scooner, and from her, to be put a&s;hore; but I was order'd to remain on Board the Commadore till by a gene|ral Vote of the Company it &s;hould be determin'd how I and the Sloop were to be di&s;pos'd of; and Captain <HI>Loe</HI> ordered a Hammock and Bedding to be fix'd for me, and told me, <HI>That he would not oblige me to &s;it up later than I thought fit, nor drink more than &s;uited my own Inclination; and that he lik'd my Company no longer than his was agreeable to me;</HI> adding, <HI>That there &s;hould be no Confine|ment or Obligation as to drinking, or &s;itting up, but I might drink, and go to &s;leep, when I pleas'd, with|out any Exceptions being taken, ordering me to want for nothing that was on Board; for I was very wel|come to any thing that was there, as to Eatables and Drinkables.</HI> I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I would, with all due Gratefulne&s;s, make U&s;e of that Freedom which he was &s;o generous to offer me,</HI> &amp;c. About Eight a-Clock at Night I took my Leave of him, and went to my Hammock, where I continued all Night, with Thoughts roving and perplex'd
<PB N="51" REF="57">
enough, not being able, as yet, to gue&s;s what they de&s;ign'd to do with me, whether they in|tended to give me the Sloop again, or to burn her, as I heard it to&s;s'd about by &s;ome, or to keep me as a Pri&s;oner on Board, or put me a&s;hoar.</P>
<P>My two Boys and Mate remained &s;till on Board the Sloop, but all the re&s;t they took on Board of them, not once &s;o much as asking them whether they would Enter with them, only de|manding their Names, which the Steward writ down in their Roll-Book.</P>
<P>About eight a-Clock in the Morning I turn'd out, and went upon Deck, and as I was walking backwards and forwards, as is u&s;ual among&s;t us Sailors, there came up one of the Company to me, and bid me Good-Morrow, and told me, <HI>He was very &s;orry for my Misfortune.</HI> I an&s;wer'd, <HI>So was I:</HI> He look'd at me, and &s;aid, <HI>He be|liev'd I did not know him.</HI> I replied, <HI>It was true, I did not know him; neither, at pre&s;ent, could I call to mind that ever I had &s;een him before in the whole Cour&s;e of my Life.</HI> He &s;mil'd, and &s;aid, <HI>He once belong'd to me, and &s;ail'd with me when I was Commander of the</HI> Su&s;annah <HI>in the Year</HI> 1718 (At that Time I was Ma&s;ter of a Ship call'd the <HI>Su|&s;annah,</HI> about the Burthen of 300 Tons, where|of was &s;ole Owner Mr. <HI>Richard Stephens,</HI> Mer|chant, living at this pre&s;ent writing in <HI>Shad-Thames, Southwark</HI> Side, near <HI>London&mdash;.)</HI> In the <HI>Interim</HI> came up two more, who told me they all belong'd to me in the <HI>Su&s;annah,</HI> at one Time. By this time I had recollected my Me|mory &s;o far as ju&s;t to call them to Mind, and that was all; and then I told them I did remember them. They &s;aid, they were truly very &s;orry for my Misfortune, and would do all that lay in their Power to &s;erve me, and told me, they had among
<PB N="52" REF="58">
them the Quantity of about 40 or 50 Pieces of white Linnen Cloth, and 6 or 8 Pieces of Silk, be&s;ides &s;ome other Things; and they would al&s;o, they &s;aid, make what Intere&s;t they could for me with their Con&s;orts and Intimates, and with them would make a Gathering for me of what Things they could, and would put it on Board for me as &s;oon as the Company had determined that I &s;hould have my Sloop again. They then look'd about them as tho' they had &s;ome|thing to &s;ay that they were not willing any body &s;hould hear; but as it happen'd, there was no body nigh us, which was an Opportunity very rare in the&s;e Sort of Ships, of &s;peaking with|out Interruption: But we lying too all Night, no body had any thing to do, but the Lookers-out, at the Topma&s;t-head; the Mate of the Watch, Quarter-ma&s;ter of the Watch, Helm&s;|man, &amp;c. being gone down to drink a Dram, I &s;uppo&s;e, or to &s;moak a Pipe of Tobacco, or the like. However it was, we had the Quarter Deck intire to our &s;elves, and they &s;eeing the Coa&s;t clear, told me, with much &s;eeming Concern, That if I did not take abundance of Care, they would force me to &s;tay with them, for my Mate had inform'd them, that I was very well acquaint|ed on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> and they were bound down along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and afterwards de&s;ign'd to &s;tretch over to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra|&s;ile:</HI> That there was not one Man of all the Company that had ever been upon any Part of that Coa&s;t; and that there was but one Way for me to e&s;cape being forced; but I mu&s;t be very clo&s;e, and not di&s;cover what they were going to tell me; for if it was known that they had divulg'd it, notwith&s;tanding they were en|ter'd Men, and as much of the Company as any of them, yet they were &s;ure it would co&s;t them
<PB N="53" REF="59">
no &s;maller a Price for it than their Lives. I told them, I was very much obliged to them for their Good-will, and did not wi&s;h them to have any Occa&s;ion for my Service; but if ever it &s;hould be &s;o, they might depend it &s;hould be to the utmo&s;t of my Power; and as for my betraying any thing that they &s;hould tell me of, they could not fear that, becau&s;e my own Intere&s;t would be a &s;uffici|ent Tye upon me to the contrary; and were it not &s;o, and that I was &s;ure to get Mountains of Gold by divulging it to their Prejudice, I would fooner &s;uffer my Tongue to be pluck'd out.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid, they did not much fear my reveal|ing it, becau&s;e the di&s;clo&s;ing it would rather be a Prejudice to me than an Advantage, and there|fore out of pure Re&s;pect to me they would tell me; which was thus:</HI> You mu&s;t know, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> that we have an Article which we are &s;worn to, which is, not to force any married Man, again&s;t his Will, to &s;erve us: Now we have been at a clo&s;e Con&s;ultation whether we &s;hould oblige you to go with us, not as one of the Company, but as a forc'd Pri|&s;oner, in order to be our Pilot on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra|&s;ile,</HI> where we are de&s;igned to Crui&s;e, and hope to make our Voyage; and your Mate, <HI>continued they,</HI> has offer'd to Enter with us, but de&s;ires to defer it till we have determined your Ca&s;e. Now your Mate, as yet, is ignorant of our Articles, we never expo|&s;ing them to any till they are going to &s;ign them. He was ask'd, Whether you was married or not? and he &s;aid, he could not tell for certain, but believed you was not: Upon which we &s;poke, and &s;aid, we had known you &s;everal Years, and had &s;ail'd with you in a Frigat-built Ship of <HI>300</HI> Tons, or more: That you was an extraordinary good Man to your Men, both for U&s;age and Payment; and that, to our Knowledge, you was married, and had four Children then: However, there is one Man who

would fain have the Company break through their Oath on that Article, and tells them, they may, and ought to do it, becau&s;e it is a Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, they having no Po&s;&s;ibility of getting a Pilot at pre&s;ent for that Coa&s;t, except they take you: And in their Run a|long the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> if they &s;hould light of any body that was acquainted with the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> and no way exempted from &s;erving them by the Ar|ticles, then they might take him, and turn you a|&s;hore, but 'till &s;uch offer'd, he did not &s;ee but the Oath might be di&s;pens'd with; but, <HI>continued they,</HI> Captain <HI>Loe</HI> is very much again&s;t it, and told them, That it would be an ill Precedent, and of bad Con|&s;equence; for if we once take the Liberty of breaking our Articles and Oath, then there is none of us can be &s;ure of any thing: If, <HI>&s;aid Captain</HI> Loe, you can per&s;wade the Man upon any Terms to &s;tay with us as a Pri&s;oner, or otherwi&s;e, well and good; if not, do not let us break the Laws that we have made our &s;elves, and &s;worn to. <HI>They went on, and told me,</HI> That mo&s;t of the Company &s;eem'd to agree with Captain <HI>Loe</HI>'s Opinion, but <HI>Ru&s;&s;el, &s;aid they,</HI> &s;eem'd to be &s;adly nettled at it, that his Advice was not to be taken; and, <HI>continued they,</HI> you will be ask'd the Que&s;tion, we reckon, by and by, when <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> comes on Board, and all the Heads meet again; but you mu&s;t be &s;ure to &s;ay you are married, and have five or &s;ix Children; for it is only that, that will prevent your being forced; tho', you may depend upon it, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> will do what he can to per&s;wade the Company to break the Article, which we hope they will not, nor &s;hall they ever have our Con&s;ent; and, indeed, there are very few of the Company but what are again&s;t it, but <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> bears a great Sway in the Company, and can al|mo&s;t draw them any Way.

<P>Upon this, away they went, and by-and-by Captain <HI>Loe</HI> turns out, and comes upon Deck, and bidding me Good-morrow, ask'd me, <HI>How I did? and how I lik'd my Bed?</HI> I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I was very well, at his Service, and lik'd my Bed very well, and was very much obliged to him for the Care he had taken of me.</HI> After which, he order'd a Con&s;ultation Signal to be made, which was their <HI>Green Trumpeter,</HI> as they call'd him, hoi&s;ted at the Mizen-Peek: It was a green &s;ilk Flag, with a yellow Figure of a Man blow|ing a Trumpet on it. The Signal being made, away came the Boats flocking on Board the Com|madore, and when they were all come on Board, Captain <HI>Loe</HI> told them, He only wanted them to Breakfa&s;t with him; &s;o down they went into the Cabbin, as many as it would well hold, and the re&s;t in the Steerage, and where they could.</P>

Well but, <HI>&s;ays Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould let you
<PB N="58" REF="64">
have the Sloop, and that you could do as you &s;ay, what would you do for Provi&s;ions? for we &s;hall leave you none; and I &s;uppo&s;e I need not tell you, for, without doubt, you know it already, that all the&s;e I&s;lands to Windward are in great Scarcity of Victuals, and e&s;pecially the two I&s;lands that pro|duce the Salt, which have been oppre&s;s'd for many Years with a &s;ore Famine. <HI>I told him,</HI> I was very &s;en&s;ible that all he &s;aid la&s;t was true, but hop'd, if they gave me the Sloop, they would al&s;o be &s;o generous as to give me &s;ome Provi&s;ions, a &s;mall Quantity of which would &s;erve my little Company; but if not, I could go down to the Leeward I&s;lands, where, likewi&s;e, I had &s;ome &s;mall Intere&s;t, and I did not doubt but I could have a &s;mall Matter of &s;uch Provi&s;ions as the I&s;lands afforded, namely, Maiz Pompions, Fe&s;hunes, &amp;c. with which, by God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we would endeavour to make &s;hift, 'till it plea&s;ed God we could get better. Ay but, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> perhaps your Mate and Boys will not be willing to run that Hazard with you, nor care to endure &s;uch Hard&s;hip. <HI>I told him,</HI> As for my Boys, I did not fear their Compliance, and hop'd my Mate would al&s;o do the &s;ame, &s;eeing I requir'd him to undergo no other Hard&s;hip but what I partook of my&s;elf. Ay, but, <HI>&s;ays Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> Your Mate has not the &s;ame Rea&s;ons as you have, to induce him to bear with all tho&s;e Hard&s;hips, which you mu&s;t certainly be expo&s;ed to in doing what you propo&s;e; and there|fore you cannot expect him to be very forward in accepting &s;uch hard Terms with you; (tho' I cannot conceive it to be &s;o ea&s;ie to go through with, in the Manner you propo&s;e, as you &s;eem to make it). <HI>I an&s;wer'd,</HI> As for the Mate's Inclinations, I was not able po&s;itively to judge in this Affair, but I be|lieved him to be an hone&s;t, as well as a con&s;cien|tious Man, and as I had been very civil&punc; to him in &s;everal Re&s;pects, in my Pro&s;perity, &s;o I did not
<PB N="59" REF="65">
doubt, if I had the Liberty to talk with him a little on this Affair, but he would be very willing to undergo as much Hard&s;hip to extricate me out of this my Adver&s;ity, as he could well bear, or I in Rea&s;on require of him, which would be no more than I &s;hould bear my&s;elf; and when it plea&s;ed God to turn the Scales, I would endeavour to make him Satisfaction to the full of what, in rea&s;on, he could expect, or, at lea&s;t, as far as I was able.</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>&s;ays Captain</HI> Loe, let us drink about.

<P>They all agreed to this, and then began to talk of their pa&s;t Tran&s;actions at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;lands, Canary I&s;lands,</HI> &amp;c. What Ships they had taken, and how they &s;erv'd them when in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and how they oblig'd the Go|vernor of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Michael</HI> to &s;end them off two Boat-Loads of fre&s;h Meat, Greens, Wine, Fowls, &amp;c. or otherwi&s;e, threatned to damnifie the I&s;land, by burning &s;ome of the &s;mall Vilages: Of their Landing on the I&s;land of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> to the Northward of <HI>Oratavo,</HI> in hopes of meeting with a Booty, but got nothing but their Skins full of Wine; and how they had like to have been &s;ur|priz'd by the Country, which was rai&s;ed upon that Occa&s;ion, but got all off &s;afe, and without any Harm, except one Man, who receiv'd a Shot in his Thigh after they were got into their Boats; but, they &s;aid, they cau&s;ed &s;everal of the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> to drop; and, That they &s;hould have been certainly lo&s;t, if they had tarried but half a quar|ter of an Hour longer in the Hou&s;e where they were drinking, and where they expected to get the
<PB N="60" REF="66">
Booty, which they Landed in que&s;t of, accord|ing to the Information given them by one of the Inhabitants of the I&s;land, who was taken by them in a Fi&s;hing-Boat, and told them, that, that Gentleman had an incredible Quantity of Mo|ney, as well as Plate, in his Hou&s;e: And on this Occa&s;ion they threatned the poor Fi&s;herman how &s;everly they would puni&s;h him for giving them a fal&s;e Information, if ever they &s;hould light of him again; but, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Fellow kept clo&s;e a&s;hore after they let him go, all the Time they lay lurking about the I&s;land: They al&s;o boa&s;ted how many <HI>French</HI> Ships they had taken upon the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and what a va&s;t Quantity of Wine, e&s;pecially <HI>French</HI> Claret, they took from them; with abundance of &s;uch like Stuff; which, as it did not immediately concern me, &s;o I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf with particularizing: And, indeed, my Attention was &s;o wholly taken up with the Uncertainty of my own Affairs, that I gave no great Heed to tho&s;e Subjects that were foreign to me; and which, for that Rea&s;on, made but a &s;light Im|pre&s;&s;ion on my Memory.</P>
<P>In this Manner they pa&s;s'd the Time away, drinking and carou&s;ing merrily, both before and after Dinner, which they eat in a very di&s;orderly Manner, more like a Kennel of Hounds, than like Men, &s;natching and catching the Victuals from one another; which, tho' it was very odi|ous to me, it &s;eem'd one of their chief Diver&s;i|ons, and, they &s;aid, look'd Martial-like.</P>
<P>Before it was quite dark, every one repaired on Board their re&s;pective Ve&s;&s;els, and about Eight a-Clock at Night I went to my Hammock, without ob&s;erving, as I remember, any thing worth remarking, &s;ave, that Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> and I, and three or four more, drank a couple of Bot|tles
<PB N="61" REF="67">
of Wine after the Company were gone, be|fore we went to Sleep, in which time we had abundance of Di&s;cour&s;e concerning <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> as al&s;o about <HI>Trade,</HI> which would be te|dious to relate in that confu&s;ed Manner we talked of the&s;e Subjects, be&s;ides the Rea&s;on I ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Loe</HI> &s;tay'd up after me, and when I was in my Hammock, I heard him give the nece&s;&s;ary Or|ders for the Night, which were, that they were to lie too with their Head to the <HI>North We&s;tward,</HI> as, indeed, we had ever &s;ince I had been on Board of him; to mind the Top-light, and for the Watch, to be &s;ure, above all things, to keep a good Look-out; and to call him if they &s;aw any thing, or if the other Ships made any Signals.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed this Night as the former, ruminating on my pre&s;ent unhappy Condition, not yet being able to dive into, or fathom their De&s;igns, or what they intended to do with me, and often thinking on what the three Men told me, as al&s;o on what the Company &s;aid, but in a more parti|cular manner, of what <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> told me concerning my Mate, 'till Sleep overpowered my Sen&s;es, and gave me a &s;hort Rece&s;s from my Troubles.</P>
<P>In the Morning, about five a-Clock, I turned out, and a little after, one of the three Men who &s;poke to me the Morning before, came to me, and bid me Good-morrow, and ask'd me very courteou&s;ly how I did? and told me, that they would all three, as before, have come and &s;poke to me, but were afraid the Company, e&s;pecially <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Friends, would think they held a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with me, which was again&s;t one of their Articles, it being puni&s;hable by Death, to hold any &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with a Pri&s;o|ner; but they hop'd all would be well, and that they believ'd I &s;hould have my Sloop again; <HI>Ru&s;|&s;el</HI>

He al&s;o &s;aid, That he, and the other two, heartily wi&s;h'd they could go with me in her, but that it was impo&s;&s;ible to expect it, it being Death even to motion it, by another of their Articles, which &s;ays, <HI>That if any of the Company &s;hall advi&s;e, or &s;peak any thing tending to the &s;eparating or breaking of the Company, or &s;hall by any Means offer or en|deavour to de&s;ert or quit the Company, that Per&s;on &s;hall be &s;hot to Death by the Quarter-Ma&s;ter's Or|der, without the Sentence of a Court-Martial.</HI> He added, That 'till my Mate had given <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> an Account of my being acquainted on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> he &s;eem'd to be my be&s;t Friend, and would certainly have prov'd &s;o, and would have prevail'd with the Company to have made a Ga|thering for me, which, perhaps, might not have come much &s;hort in Value of what they had ta|ken from me; for there was but few in the Com|pany but had &s;everal Pieces of Linnen Cloth, Pieces of Silk, &s;pare Hats, Shoes, Stockings, gold Lace, and abundance of other Goods, be&s;ides the publick Store, which, if <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had continued my Friend, for one Word &s;peaking, there was not one of them but would have contributed to make up my Lo&s;s; it being u&s;ual for them to re&s;erve &s;uch Things for no other U&s;e but to give to any whom they &s;hould take, or that formerly was of their Acquaintance, or that they took a

<P>Some time after, Captain <HI>Loe</HI> turn'd out, and after the u&s;ual Compliments pa&s;s'd, we took a Dram of Rum, and enter'd into Di&s;cour&s;e with one or another, on different Subjects; for as a Tavern or Alehou&s;e-keeper endeavours to pro|mote his Trade, by conforming to the Humours of every Cu&s;tomer, &s;o was I forc'd to be plea|&s;ant with every one, and bear a Bob with them in almo&s;t all their Sorts of Di&s;cour&s;e, tho' never

<P>Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> with &s;ome more, came on Board about ten or eleven a-Clock in the Fore|noon, and &s;eem'd to be very plea&s;ant to me, asking me how I did? telling me, that he had been con&s;idering of what I &s;aid Ye&s;terday, and could not &s;ee, how I &s;hould be able to go through with it: That it would be very difficult, if not wholly impo&s;&s;ible, and I &s;hould run a very great Hazard in what I propos'd. He believ'd, he &s;aid, that I was a Man, and a Man of Under|&s;tanding, but in this Ca&s;e I rather &s;eem'd to be directed by an ob&s;tinate De&s;peration, than by Rea&s;on; and for his Part, &s;ince I was &s;o care|le&s;s of my&s;elf as to determine to throw my&s;elf away, he did not think it would &s;tand with the Credit or Reputation of the Company, to put it into my Power. He wi&s;h'd me well, he &s;aid, and did a&s;&s;ure me, that the Thoughts of me had taken him up the greate&s;t Part of the Night; and he had hit on a Way which, he was &s;ure, would be much more to my Advantage, and not expo&s;e me to &s;o much Hazard and Danger, and yet would be more profitable, than I could expect by having the Sloop, tho' every thing was to fall out to exceed my Expectation; and did not doubt of the Company's agreeing to it: <HI>And this,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is, to take and &s;ink or burn your Sloop, and keep you with us no otherwi&s;e than as you are now,</HI>

Lot to fall into their Hands; but, in a more e&s;pe|cial Manner, for this their now offer'd Kindne&s;s, tho' I could not accept it with a &s;afe and clear Con|&s;cience, which I valued above any Thing to be en|joy'd in this World. <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I could add farther Rea&s;ons to tho&s;e I had already urg'd; but I would not trouble them longer, fearing I had already been too tedious or offen&s;ive to &s;ome of them; which; if I had, I heartily begg'd their Pardon; a&s;&s;uring them once more, that if it was &s;o, it was neither my De&s;ign nor Intent, but the Rever&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon they all &s;aid,</HI> They liked to hear us talk, and thought we were very well match'd: <HI>Adding,</HI> That Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> could &s;eldom meet with a Man that could &s;tand him: But, as for their Parts, they were pleas'd with our Di&s;cour&s;e, and were very &s;ure <HI>Loe</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> were &s;o too.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> then &s;aid, He liked it very well; but told me, I had not return'd Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> an An&s;wer to what he la&s;t &s;aid, which he thought de&s;erv'd one.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd, That &s;ince the Gentlemen were &s;o good-natur'd, as not only to take in good Part what I had hitherto &s;aid, but al&s;o to give me free Liberty to pur&s;ue my Di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hould make U&s;e of their Indulgence, and an&s;wer what Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had &s;aid la&s;t to me, in as brief and inoffen&s;ive a Manner as I was capable of.</P>
<P><HI>Then turning to</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> Sir, Your Opi|nion of my Notion of the Right you have to any Ship or Goods you may take, is exactly true; and I think your Right cannot extend farther than your Power to maintain that Right; and therefore it mu&s;t follow, you can transfer no other Right to any one than what you have your &s;elves, which will render any Per&s;on who receiv'd them, as guilty for detaining them from the proper Owners, as you for the taking them.</P>

<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Be it &s;o; we will &s;uppo&s;e <HI>(and &s;eem|ed a little angry)</HI> for Argument Sake, we have taken a Ship, and are re&s;olv'd to &s;ink or burn her, unle&s;s you will accept of her: Now, pray, where is the Owner's Property, when the Ship is &s;unk, or burned? I think the Impo&s;&s;ibility of his having her again, cuts off his Property to all Intents and Pur|po&s;es, and our Power was the &s;ame, notwith&s;tand|ing our giving her to you, if we had thought fit to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I was loth to argue any farther, &s;eeing him be|gin to be peevi&s;h; and knowing, by the Infor|mation afore given me by the three Men, that all his pretended Kindne&s;s and Arguments were only in order to detain me, without the Imputation of having broken their Articles; which he found the major Part of the Company very aver&s;e to; wherefore, to cut all &s;hort, I told him, I was very &s;en&s;ible of the Favours de&s;ign'd me; and &s;hould always retain a grateful Sen&s;e of them: That I knew I was ab&s;olutely in their Power, and they might di&s;po&s;e of me as they pleas'd; but that having been hitherto treated &s;o gene|rou&s;ly by them, I could not doubt of their fu|ture Goodne&s;s to me: And that if they would be pleas'd to give me my Sloop again, it was all I reque&s;ted at their Hands; and I doubted not, but that, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God on my hone&s;t Endeavours, I &s;hould &s;oon be able to retrieve my pre&s;ent Lo&s;s; at lea&s;t, I &s;aid, I &s;hould have nothing to reproach my&s;elf with, whatever &s;hould befal me, as I &s;hould have, if I were to comply with the Favour they had &s;o kindly intended for me.</P>
<P><HI>Upon which, Capt.</HI> Loe <HI>&s;aid,</HI> Gentlemen, the Ma&s;ter, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, has &s;poke nothing but what is very rea&s;onable, and I think he ought to have his Sloop. What do you &s;ay Gentlemen?</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77">
The greate&s;t Part of them an&s;wer'd aloud, <HI>Ay, Ay, by G&mdash;, let the poor Man have his Sloop again, and go in God's Name, and &s;eek a Living in her for his Family. Ay,</HI> &s;aid &s;ome of them, <HI>and we ought to make &s;omething of a Gathering for the poor Man, &s;ince we have taken every Thing that he had on Board his Ve&s;&s;el.</HI> This put an End to the Di&s;pute; and every Body talked accord|ing to their Inclinations, the Punch, Wine, and Tobacco being moving Commodities all this Time: And every one who had an Opportunity of &s;peaking to me, wi&s;h'd me much Joy with, and Succe&s;s in, my newly obtain'd Sloop.</P>
<P>Towards Night, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> told Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> that as the Company had agreed to give me the Sloop again, it was to be hoped they would di&s;charge me, and let me go about my Bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;hort Time; and therefore, with his Leave, he would take me on Board the Scooner with him, to treat me with a Sneaker of Punch before parting. Accordingly, I accompany'd him on Board his Ve&s;&s;el, tho' I had rather &s;tay'd with <HI>Loe,</HI> and he welcomed me there, and made abundance of Prote&s;tations of his Kindne&s;s and Re&s;pect to me; but &s;till argued, that he thought I was very much over&s;een in not accepting what he had &s;o kindly, and out of pure Re&s;pect, offer'd to me, and which, he &s;aid, would really have been the making of me. I told him, I thank'd him for his Favour and Good-will; but was very well &s;atisfy'd with the Company's Genero&s;ity in agree|ing to give me the Sloop again, which, I &s;aid, was more &s;atisfactory to me, than the riche&s;t Prize that they could take.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays he, I wi&s;h it may prove according to your Expectation. I thank'd him; &s;o down we went into the Cabbin, and, with the Officers

only, diverted our&s;elves in talking 'till Supper was laid on the Table.</P>
<P>After Supper, a Bowl of Punch, and half a Dozen of Claret, being &s;et on the Table, Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> took a Bumper, and drank <HI>Succe&s;s to their Undertaking;</HI> which went round, I not daring to refu&s;e it. Next Health was <HI>Pro&s;perity to Trade,</HI> meaning their own Trade. The third Health was, <HI>The King of France:</HI> After which, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> began the <HI>King of</HI> England<HI>'s Health;</HI> &s;o they all drank round, &s;ome &s;aying, <HI>The King of</HI> England<HI>'s Health,</HI> others only <HI>The afore&s;aid Health,</HI> 'till it came round to me; and Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> having emp|ty'd two Bottles of Claret into the Bowl, as a Recruit, and there being no Liquor that I have a greater Aver&s;ion to, than red Wine in Punch, I heartily begg'd the Captain and the Company would excu&s;e my drinking any more of that Bowl, and give me leave to pledge the Health in a Bumper of Claret.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon</HI> Ru&s;&s;el <HI>&s;aid,</HI> Damn you, you &s;hall drink in your Turn a full Bumper of that Sort of Liquor that the Company does. Well, Gentlemen, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> rather than have any Words about it, I will drink it, tho' it is in a Manner Poy&s;on to me; be|cau&s;e I never drank any of this Liquor, to the be&s;t of my Remembrance, but it made me &s;ick two or three Days at lea&s;t after it. And d&mdash;n you, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, if it be in a Manner, or out of a Manner, or really, rank Poy&s;on, you &s;hall drink as much, and as often, as any one here, unle&s;s you fall down dead, dead!</P>
<P>So I took the Gla&s;s, which was one of your <HI>Hollands</HI> Gla&s;&s;es, made in the Form of a Beaker, without a Foot, holding about three Quarters of a Pint, and filling it to the Brim, &s;aid, <HI>Gentle|men, here is the afore&s;aid Health. What Health is that,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Ru&s;&s;el? Why,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>the &s;ame</HI>

<HI>Health you all have drank, The King of</HI> England<HI>'s Health. Why,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Ru&s;&s;el, who is King of</HI> Eng|land? I an&s;wer'd, <HI>In my Opinion, he that wears the Crown, is certainly King while he keeps it. Well,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and pray who is that? Why,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>King</HI> George <HI>at pre&s;ent wears it.</HI> Hereupon he broke out in the mo&s;t outrageous Fury, damn|ing me, and calling me Ra&s;cally Son of a B&mdash;; and abu&s;ing his Maje&s;ty in &s;uch a virulent Man|ner, as is not fit to be repeated, a&s;&s;erting, with bitter Cur&s;es, that we had no King.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, <HI>I admir'd that he would begin and drink a Health to a Per&s;on who was not in being.</HI> Upon which, he whipp'd one of his Pi&s;tols from his Sa&s;h, and I really believe would have &s;hot me dead, if the Gunner of the Scooner had not &s;natch'd it out of his Hand.</P>
<P>This rather more exa&s;perated <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> who continu'd &s;wearing and cur&s;ing his Maje&s;ty in the mo&s;t outrageous Terms, and a&s;&s;erting the Pre|tender to be the lawful King of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. He added, That 'twas a Sin to &s;uffer &s;uch a fal&s;e traiterous Dog as I was to live; and with that whipp'd out another Pi&s;tol from his Sa&s;h, and cock'd it, and &s;wore he would &s;hoot me through the Head, and was &s;ure he &s;hould do God and his Country good Service, by ridding the World of &s;uch a traiterous Villain. But the Ma&s;ter of the Scooner prevented him, by &s;triking the Pi&s;tol out of his Hand.</P>
<P>Whether it was with the Fall, or his Finger being on the Trigger, I cannot tell, but the Pi&s;tol went off without doing any Damage: At which the Ma&s;ter, and all pre&s;ent, blamed <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> for being &s;o ra&s;h and ha&s;ty; and the Gunner &s;aid, I was not to blame; for that I drank the Health as it was fir&s;t propos'd, and there being no Names mention'd, and King <HI>George</HI> being

po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Crown, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Au|thority of Parliament, he did not &s;ee but his Title was the be&s;t. <HI>But what have we to do,</HI> continued he, <HI>with the Rights of Kings or Princes? Our Bu&s;ine&s;s here, is to chu&s;e a King for our own Commonwealth; to make &s;uch Laws as we think mo&s;t conducive to the Ends we de&s;ign; and to keep our&s;elves from being overcome, and &s;ubjected to the Penalty of tho&s;e Laws which are made again&s;t us.</HI> He then intimated to <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> That he mu&s;t &s;peak his Sentiments freely, and imputed his Quarrel with me, to his being hinder'd from breaking thro' their Articles: Urging, that he would ap|pear no better than an Infringer of their Laws, if the Matter were narrowly look'd into: And that it was impo&s;&s;ible ever to have any Order or Rule ob&s;erv'd, if their Statutes were once bro|ken thro'. He put him in Mind of the Penalty, which was Death, to any one who &s;hould infringe their Laws; and urg'd, That if it were once admitted that a Man, thro' Pa&s;&s;ion, or the like, &s;hould be excu&s;ed breaking in upon them, there would be an End to their Society: And con|cluded with telling him, that it was an extraor|dinary Indulgence in the Company, not to re|mind him of the Penalty he had incurr'd.</P>
<P><HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> &s;till continuing his Pa&s;&s;ion, an&s;wer'd, That if he had tran&s;gre&s;s'd, it was not for the Sake of his own private Intere&s;t, but for the ge|neral Good of the Company; and therefore did not fear, neither in Ju&s;tice could he expect, any Severity from the Company for what he had done; and for that Rea&s;on, whatever he (the Gunner) or tho&s;e of his Sentiments, thought of it, he was re&s;olv'd, whatever came of it, to pur|&s;ue his pre&s;ent Humour.</P>

<HI>Then &s;ays the Gunner to the re&s;t,</HI> Well, Gentlemen, if you have a Mind to maintain tho&s;e Laws made, e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and &s;worn to by you all, as I think we are all obligated by the &s;tronge&s;t Tyes of Rea&s;on and Self-Intere&s;t to do, I a&s;&s;ure you, my Opinion is, that we ought to &s;ecure <HI>John Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> &s;o as to prevent his breaking our Laws and Con&s;ti|tutions, and thereby do our&s;elves, and him too, good Service: Our&s;elves, by not &s;uffering &s;uch an Acti|on of Cruelty in cold Blood, as he more than once attempted to commit, as you are Eye-witne&s;&s;es of, and, I believe, mo&s;t on Board have been Ear-wit|ne&s;&s;es to the Pi&s;tol's going off; and all this for no other Rea&s;on in the World, but through a proud and ambitious Humour, conceiting he is the Man that is not to be contradicted, and that his Words, though tending to our Ruin, mu&s;t yet be receiv'd as an Ora|cle, without any Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>At which they all &s;aid, It was a pity the Ma|&s;ter &s;hould &s;uffer, neither would they permit it; and &s;peaking to <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> they &s;aid, they would not allow him to be &s;o barbarous: That they had always valued them&s;elves upon this very Thing of being civil to their Pri&s;oners, and not abu&s;ing their Per&s;ons: That, 'till now, he him|&s;elf had been always the greate&s;t Per&s;wader to Clemency, and even to the forgiving Provocati|ons, and permitting them to go from 'em with as little Lo&s;s as could be, after they had taken what they had Occa&s;ion for: <HI>But now,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>you are quite the Rever&s;e, to this poor Man, and for no other Rea&s;on, that we know of, but, as the Gunner &s;aid ju&s;t now, becau&s;e we would not yield a greater Power to you alone, then you with the whole Com|pany have when conjoin'd; that is, that you at any Time, to gratify your own Humour, &s;hall have Li|berty, not only to di&s;pen&s;e with our Laws, but to act again&s;t the Sentiments of the whole Company.</HI></P>

Hereupon the Ma&s;ter interrupting him, &s;aid,</HI> Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> we know of no Rea&s;on for your pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ign, but what we have told you; and, as you have been told before, it reflects a Revenge again&s;t the Company; but not being able to effect that, you turn it on that poor Man the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop, and, as it were, in de&s;pite of the Company, becau&s;e they have decreed him his Sloop again, that he may provide a Living for his Family, you would barbarou&s;ly, nay bruti&s;hly, as well as to the Compa|ny contemptuou&s;ly, murder that poor Man, who has given you no Occa&s;ion to induce you to &s;uch an Acti|on that we know of; and if he has given you any &s;ufficient Cau&s;e to be &s;o offended at him, we promi&s;e you this In&s;tant, to deliver him up to you, to &s;uffer Death, or what other Puni&s;hment you think fit to inflict on him.</P>

<P>Then, <HI>&s;ays the Gunner,</HI> neither do we think proper that you &s;hall take any Man's Life away in cold Blood, 'till you think fit to acquaint the Com|pany with the Rea&s;ons for it; and I think it was your Place to &s;atisfy the Company, before you took

the Liberty to attempt the Life of any Man under the Company's Protection, as I think all Pri&s;oners are: And, to &s;ay the Truth, I do verily believe, you have no other Rea&s;ons to give than tho&s;e hinted by the Ma&s;ter and me; and therefore, I think it but Rea&s;on, to u&s;e &s;uch Methods as may prevent your pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ign, and &s;ecure the Pri&s;oner 'till Morn|ing, and then &s;end him on Board the Commodore, who, with the Advice of the Majority, may order the Matter as he thinks be&s;t.</P>
<P>This was con&s;ented to by all, and &s;o <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> having his Arms taken from him, was order'd not to offer the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance again, nor con|cern him&s;elf with or about me, 'till after I was on Board the Commodore, on Pain of the Crew's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and al&s;o of being pro&s;ecuted as a Mutineer; and the Gunner, Ma&s;ter, Boat&s;wain, &amp;c. bid me not be di&s;courag'd; a&s;&s;uring me, that there &s;hould no Harm come to me while I was on Board of them; and that they would &s;end me away now, but that there is, &s;aid they, an expre&s;s Order among us, to receive no Boats on Board after eight at Night, or nine a-Clock at farthe&s;t; but they would put me on Board Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> in the Morning, where they were &s;ure I &s;hould be protected and &s;ecur'd from the re|vengeful Hand of Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el;</HI> for they &s;aid, they were &s;ure that Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> had a great Re|&s;pect for me, and would be a Means to counter|ballance <HI>Ru&s;&s;el;</HI> and they &s;aid they would &s;it up with me all Night for my greater Security: Which they did, &s;moaking and drinking and talking, eve|ry one according to his Inclination, and &s;o we pa&s;s'd the Time away 'till Day.</P>

<P>About eight a-Clock in the Morning, I was carry'd on Board Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> the Gunner and Steward going with me, who told him all that had pa&s;s'd; and acquainted him, that they &s;till believ'd <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> to be &s;o implacable again&s;t me, that he would murder me in cold Blood before I got clear of them, if he did not interpo&s;e to protect me from his Violence. Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> &s;aid, He very well knew, and he believ'd &s;o did they all, what was the Rea&s;on that made <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;o in|veterate and implacable to me: He added, That <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> did not do well; and that I had be|hav'd my&s;elf &s;o inoffen&s;ively, that there could be no Rea&s;on to induce the mo&s;t &s;avage Mon&s;ter to be &s;uch an irreconcileable Enemy to me; but that 'twas an ea&s;y Matter to dive into the Cau&s;e of it, to wit, his being thwarted by the Compa|ny in his Humour; and becau&s;e they would not break thro' the Articles which cemented them together, and which were &s;ign'd and &s;wore to by them all, as the &s;tanding Rule of their Duty, by which only they could decide and &s;ettle Con|trover&s;ies and Differences among them&s;elves; the lea&s;t Breach of which, would be a Precedent for the like Infractions, whenever <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> or any other, thought fit to give Way either to Re|venge or Ambition, and that then all their Coun&s;els would be fluctuating; and Fancy, and not Rea&s;on, would be the Rule of their Con|duct; and their Re&s;olutions would be render'd more uncon&s;tant than the Weathercock. He added, That he hoped the Company would in|violably adhere to their e&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws, which, he &s;aid, were very good; and were they not, yet, as they were made by the unanimous Con|&s;ent of the whole Company, &s;o they ought not

to be alter'd without the &s;ame unanimous Con|&s;ent; concluding, that, for his Part, he would rather chu&s;e to be out of the Company than in it, if they did not re&s;olve to be determin'd by their Articles. Hereupon they an&s;wer'd, That what he had &s;aid was very good, and they were re&s;olv'd to adhere to his Advice.</P>
<P>After this they drank a Dram, and then re|turn'd with their Boat on Board the Scooner; and Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> told me, he was &s;orry for Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t me, becau&s;e he believ'd it would be a Di&s;advantage to me; but, how|ever, there was no Remedy but Patience; a&s;|&s;uring me, That <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;hould neither kill me, nor abu&s;e my Per&s;on, and I &s;hould have my Sloop again, and be di&s;charg'd in as &s;hort a while as po&s;&s;ible, that I might be clear of <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> who, he was afraid, would always continue my Foe.</P>
<P>All the Officers and Men likewi&s;e &s;poke very friendly to me, and bid me not be daunted; &s;o we pa&s;s'd the Time away in &s;everal Kinds of Di&s;cour&s;e 'till Dinner; after which, <HI>Loe</HI> order'd a Bowl of Punch to be made, and &s;aid he wi&s;h'd I was well clear of them.</P>
<P>About four a-Clock in the Afternoon Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came on Board, as did al&s;o <HI>Francis Spriggs,</HI> who commanded the other Ship, and after a little while, &s;ays <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> to Capt. <HI>Loe, The Mate of the Sloop is willing to enter with us as a Volunteer.</HI></P>

<P>Ru&s;&s;el <HI>&s;aid,</HI> He could not help that. But, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Loe, we mu&s;t not take all the Hands from the poor Men, if we de&s;ign to give him his Sloop again;

<P>Z&mdash;ds, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, his Mate is a lu&s;ty young brisk Man, and has been upon the Account before, and told me but even now, (for, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I was on Board the Sloop but ju&s;t before I came here, and <HI>Frank Spriggs</HI> was along with me, and heard him &s;ay,) That he was fully re&s;olv'd to go with us, and would not go any more in the Sloop, unle&s;s forced; and when he came out of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> he &s;aid, his De&s;ign was to enter him&s;elf on Board the fir&s;t Pyrate that he met with; and will you refu&s;e &s;uch a Man, contrary to your Articles, which you all &s;o much profe&s;s to follow; and which enjoin you by all Means, not repugnant to them, to encrea&s;e and fill your Company?

<P>I was going to make him a Reply, but ca&s;ting my Eye on Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> he wink'd at me to be &s;i|lent; and taking a Bumper, drank Succe&s;s to their Proceedings.

<P>Now you mu&s;t believe the&s;e Accounts were not a little &s;hocking to me; but I had no Friend that I could really rely on, but God, to whom I made my Petitions, and who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance I hum|bly be&s;ought, to extricate me, in his own good Time, out of the&s;e Difficulties and Snares which were laid for me on every Side, and, in the mean Time, patiently &s;o to bear them, as not to murmur and repine at his fatherly Cha&s;ti&s;e|ments, nor, by their Extremity, through De&s;pe|ration, wound my Con&s;cience; but that in all Things I might, through the Guidance of the holy Spirit, be directed &s;o as to &s;ubmit my&s;elf entirely to his Will, who infinitely knew what was better for me than I knew my&s;elf.</P>

<P>I told him, I had very good Rea&s;ons to re|turn him my hearty Thanks, and own'd my&s;elf bound to him in the &s;tricte&s;t Ties of Gratitude; and that if it ever &s;hould be in my Power to &s;erve him, I would not content my&s;elf with bare Acknowledgments of his Favour.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, His Will was at pre&s;ent more exten|&s;ive than his Power; but that he &s;till hoped to prevail with <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and tho&s;e who were of his Side, to be more compa&s;&s;ionate to me before I parted with them, than at pre&s;ent they &s;eem'd to intend, and as &s;oon as he had brought them to a better Temper, he then would procure my Di&s;charge; but if <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;till continu'd inexora|ble, which he &s;hould be very &s;orry for, then you mu&s;t endeavour, &s;ays he, to keep up a good Heart, and patiently wait 'till Providence brings you out of your pre&s;ent Calamities, which I hope he will.</P>

<P>Well, well, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, if it be done by God's Permi&s;&s;ion, you need not fear that he will permit any Thing hurtful to befall &s;o good a Man as you are.</P>
<P><HI>About ten a-Clock at Night, he order'd to call the Sloop's Boat, which was brought by &s;ome of the Pirates of his own Clan, who were</HI>

<HI>&s;tation'd on Board of her, and ask'd them,</HI> If they had done as he had order'd them, <HI>viz.</HI> to clear the Sloop of every Thing? <HI>And they &s;aid</HI> Yes, <HI>rap|ing out a great Oath or two, adding,</HI> She had nothing on Board except Balla&s;t and Water.

So we did, <HI>&s;aid they;</HI> but the Water that we &s;poke of was Salt|water, leak'd in by the Ve&s;&s;el, and is now above the Balla&s;t; for we have not pump'd her we do not know when.</P>
<P><HI>Said</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, Have you brought away the Sails I told you of? <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> All but the Main&s;ail that was bent, for the other old Main&s;ail that he had order'd to be left, was good for nothing but to cut up for Parceling, and hardly for that, it was &s;o rotten; be&s;ides, it was &s;o torn, that it could not be brought too, and was pa&s;t mending, and for that Rea&s;on they let it lie, and would not unbend the other Main&s;ail.</P>
<P>Z&mdash;ds, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, we mu&s;t have it, for I want it to make us a Main&s;ail. D&mdash;n it, <HI>&s;aid the Men,</HI> then you mu&s;t turn the Man adrift in the Sloop with|out a Main&s;ail.</P>
<P>Pi&s;h, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, the &s;ame miraculous Power that is to bring him Provi&s;ions, can al&s;o bring him a Sail.</P>
<P>What a Devil, is he a Conjurer? <HI>&s;aid one of them.</HI></P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Ru&s;&s;el, but he expects Miracles to be wrought for him, or he never would have cho&s;en what he hath.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> if he be &s;uch a one, he will do well enough; but I doubt, <HI>&s;ays one of them,</HI> he will fall &s;hort of his Expectation; for if he be &s;uch a mighty Conjurer, how the Devil was it that he did not conjure him&s;elf clear of us?</P>

<P>Come, come, <HI>&s;ays the Gunner,</HI> Gentlemen, the poor Man is like to go through Hard&s;hip enough, and very probably may peri&s;h; yet it is not impo&s;&s;ible but he may meet with &s;ome Ship, or other timely Suc|cour, to prevent his peri&s;hing, and I heartily wi&s;h he may; but however, you ought not to add Af|fliction to the Afflicted; You have &s;entenc'd him to a very dangerous Chance, which I think is &s;ufficient to &s;top your Mouths from making a Droll and Game of him. I would have you con&s;ider, <HI>added he,</HI> if any of you were at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> or any other Place to be executed, as many better and &s;touter Men than &s;ome of you, have been, and the Spectators, or <HI>Jack Catch</HI> &s;hould make a Droll and May-game of you, you would think them a very hard-hearted, as well as an incon&s;iderate Sort of People: And pray, Gentlemen, con&s;ider the Sentence which you are now going to execute on this poor Man, will be as bad, or rather wor&s;e, than one of our Ca&s;es would be there; becau&s;e, unle&s;s Providence &s;tand his Friend in an extraordinary Manner, his Death mu&s;t as cer|tainly en&s;ue or be the Con&s;equence of this your Sen|tence, as it would there be to any of us by the Sen|tence of a Judge, and &s;o much the more mi&s;erable, by how much it is more lingering.</P>

except in Fight, and not in cold Blood, or for pri|vate Revenge. And I tell you, <HI>John Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> if ever &s;uch Ca&s;es as the&s;e be any more practis'd, my Endeavour &s;hall be to leave this Company as &s;oon as I po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>To which <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;aid nothing in An&s;wer; but bid the Men that came on Board in the Boat, to leave the Sloop's Boat on Board the Scooner, and take the Scooner's Boat with them on Board the Sloop; and, as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Lights upon Deck on Board of the Scooner, to come away from the Sloop with the Scooner's Boat, and bring the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop's bigge&s;t Boy with them; and to take their Hands out of the Sloop's Boat, and put the Ma&s;ter's Boy on Board of the Sloop's Boat with his Ma&s;ter, and let them go on Board them&s;elves with their Boat, and to be &s;ure to bring the Sloop's Main&s;ail with them, and al&s;o the Mate of the Sloop. All which they &s;aid they would do; &s;o away they went; and then <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> told me, <HI>He would give me &s;omething with me to remember him;</HI> which was an old Musket, and a Cartridge of Powder, but for what Rea&s;on he made me that Pre&s;ent, I cannot tell; and then order'd the Candles to be lighted in the Lanthorns and carry'd upon Deck, and order'd two Hands to &s;tep into the Sloop's Boat to carry me away, and to execute his for|mer Orders; and then &s;haking Hands with me, he wi&s;h'd me a good Voyage. I told him I hoped I &s;hould. The Gunner, Ma&s;ter, and &s;everal of the Crew, &s;hook Hands with me al&s;o, and hear|tily wi&s;h'd me Succe&s;s, and hoped I &s;hould meet with a &s;peedy and &s;afe Deliverance. I thank'd them for their good Wi&s;hes; and told them I was now forc'd into a Nece&s;&s;ity of going through it, whether I would or not; but thank'd God I was very ea&s;y at pre&s;ent, not doubting in God's
<PB N="96" REF="102">
Mercy to me, tho' I was not de&s;erving of it: And that if I was permitted to peri&s;h, I knew the wor&s;t; and doubted not but he would graci|ou&s;ly pardon my Sins, and receive me to his Everla&s;ting Re&s;t; and, in this Re&s;pect, what they had intended for my Misfortune, would be the Beginning of my Happine&s;s; and that in the mean Time, I had nothing to do but to re&s;ign my&s;elf to his ble&s;&s;ed Will and Protection, and bear my Lot with Patience. And &s;o bidding them farewell, I went over the Side into the Boat, which was directly put off; and about half Way between the Scooner and Sloop, we met the Scooner's Boat, and, according to their Orders from <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> they put my Boy on Board of me, and &s;o put away again to get on Board their own Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>After their Boat put away from us, I thought I heard the Voice of my Mate, but was not cer|tain, becau&s;e he &s;poke &s;o low, his Con&s;cience checking him, I &s;uppo&s;e, for his leaving me &s;o ba&s;ely. I call'd to him, and &s;aid Arthur, <HI>what are you going to leave me?</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>Ay. What,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>do you do it voluntary, or are you forc'd?</HI> He an&s;wer'd faintly, <HI>I am forc'd, I think.</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>It was very well.</HI> He call'd to me again, and &s;aid, <HI>He would de&s;ire me to write to his Bro|ther, and give him an Account where he was, if ever I &s;hould have an Opportunity.</HI> I told him, <HI>I did not know where his Brother liv'd.</HI> He called and &s;aid, <HI>He liv'd in</HI> Carlingford. I told him, <HI>I did not know where that was.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>It was in</HI> Ireland. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>you told me in</HI> Barbadoes <HI>that you was a</HI> Scotchman, <HI>and that all your Friends liv'd in</HI> Scotland. But he made me no further An&s;wer; but away they row'd towards their Ve&s;&s;el, and I towards the Sloop, and it be|ing a very dark, as well as a clo&s;e Night, it was
<PB N="97" REF="103">
as much as ever I could do to &s;ee her; this be|ing the la&s;t Time that I &s;poke to, or &s;aw any of them, nor do I ever more de&s;ire to &s;ee them, ex|cept at &s;ome Place of Execution.</P>
<P>I &s;hipp'd this Man at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and he told me then, that he had been Mate of a Sloop be|longing to &s;ome Part of <HI>New-England,</HI> but was &s;hipwreck'd, and lo&s;t every Thing; and was al|mo&s;t naked when I fir&s;t met with him, not hav|ing a Shirt, or any Thing el&s;e of Cloathing, to &s;hift in the Room of what he had on, 'till they were wa&s;h'd, neither had he any Money; but was out of Debt there I believe, becau&s;e I ne|ver heard of any Body's coming after him for any Demands that Way, as is u&s;ual for Land|lords, &amp;c. in tho&s;e Parts in &s;uch Ca&s;es; for as &s;oon as any of their Lodgers or Debtors are &s;hipp'd on Board any Ve&s;&s;el, they make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to find out the Ma&s;ter, and acquaint him with their being Creditor to &s;uch a Per&s;on; and in Pre&s;ence of the &s;aid Per&s;on procure a Promi&s;e, if they can, from the Ma&s;ter to keep their Wages, as they &s;hall become due, in his Hands, or, at lea&s;t, &s;o much as amounts to the Debt, 'till his Return there, obliging the Debtor to a&s;&s;ign over to the Ma&s;ter an Order to autho|ri&s;e him &s;o to do, otherwi&s;e they will not &s;uffer him to go off the I&s;land. I bought him Cloaths and In&s;truments, with &s;uch other Nece&s;&s;aries as I thought might be ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for him to the Performance of the Voyage. I ob&s;erv'd no|thing in him tending to any of the common Vices, too common among Seafareing Men, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e who have frequented the&s;e Parts; to wit, Swearing, Drunkenne&s;s, Debauchery, &amp;c. He was a pretended rigid Presbyterian, and &s;eem'd mighty aver&s;e to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law, about which we had &s;eve|ral
<PB N="98" REF="104">
Arguments. I do not remember, all the Time that he was with me, to have heard him &s;wear; and yet, as my bigge&s;t Boy told me, af|ter he had acquainted the Pirates of his Re&s;olu|tion, (or rather return'd to be a Pirate again, as he by his own Di&s;cour&s;e to them manife&s;ted) then, it &s;eems, he far exceeded the mo&s;t profli|gate of them, both in the Frequency and Hor|riblene&s;s of them; and, as my Boys told me, was almo&s;t con&s;tantly drunk, while on Board the Sloop, after the Pirates had taken me.</P>
<P>But to proceed: My Boy and I got on Board the Sloop, and found neither Fire, nor Candle, nor any Thing that we knew of on Board to make the one or the other. I could hear the Water which the Sloop had in her, by her Mo|tion with the Sea, rowl from one Side to the other, as if &s;he had been almo&s;t full of Water: I ask'd the Boys when &s;he had been la&s;t pump'd, and whether &s;he had been then &s;uck'd dry; they told me, She had not been pump'd the&s;e three Days pa&s;t, and that &s;he had then been &s;uck'd dry; and they &s;aid they would have pump'd her &s;everal Times &s;ince, but the Pirates &s;wore at them, and would not let them, &s;aying, Damn her, let her &s;ink and be damn'd, they had a Boat on Board &s;ufficient to carry them all to their own Ships; and agreed to have cut a Hole through her, or fire &s;everal Shot through her Bottom as that Night, in order to &s;ink her, and with the Boat to go all on Board their own Ve&s;&s;el; and were con&s;ulting about the Manner of doing it, ju&s;t as the Scooner call'd for them to &s;end the Sloop's Boat on Board; and they verily believ'd &s;he had been quitted, if not &s;unk by this Time, if they had been let alone.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="105">
I made fa&s;t a Rope to the Ma&s;t for a Mainrope, and went down in the Hold to &s;ee what Quantity of Water was in the Sloop, and finding it not above a Foot above the Balla&s;t, I was a little en|courag'd, though that was di&s;mal enough, but yet nothing nigh &s;o bad as at fir&s;t I thought it was; for, indeed, by the Noi&s;e that the Water made, with the Motion the Sea gave the Ve&s;&s;el, I thought &s;he had been half full at lea&s;t; but finding it better than I expected, I was in Hopes to free her; and when once freed, we had little Rea&s;on of doubting, but what we &s;hould be able, while our Strength held out, to keep her &s;o, 'till it pleas'd God to &s;end us &s;ome Succour.</P>
<P>I came upon Deck, and ask'd <HI>Potter,</HI> my big|ge&s;t Boy, if the Pumps were in order, or whe|ther the Pirates had broke or put them out of order? He &s;aid, he thought not; &s;o I went to work with them, being the only Way to know; I put the two Boys to one Pump, and I exer|cis'd the other; I bid them not &s;trike with the Pump, but to draw a long drawing Stroke, which in a Manner delivers as much Water as &s;triking, e&s;pecially when there are not Hands to <HI>Spell</HI> (that is, to take Turns while the others recover Breath) be&s;ides, it doth not tire &s;o &s;oon, and con&s;equent|ly would not make them &s;o drowthy as &s;triking would. I inquir'd what drinking Water they had on Board. <HI>Potter</HI> told me, he believ'd there was not one Drop of fre&s;h Water on Board, be|cau&s;e, he &s;aid, all that was in the Sloop, except one Hog&s;head, was &s;ent on Board the Pirates; and after they came from on Board the Scooner, the two Men that went in the Boat &s;aid, Capt. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> order'd them to &s;tave that, and not leave one Drop of fre&s;h Water on Board the Sloop. <HI>But, Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I think they have done as bar|barou&s;ly by us in another Re&s;pect, as in leaving us</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="106">
<HI>without Provi&s;ions. Ay,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>What is that?

What,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>have they &s;erv'd us &s;o,</HI> (making as tho' I had known nothing of the Matter, neither did I but of the Main&s;ail, which <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> order'd them to unbend, and bring away with them when they came away from the Sloop.) <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>never fear, Boy, I tru&s;t in God we &s;hall do well enough &s;till, in de&s;pight of all their Malice. Ay, Ay, Sir,</HI> &s;ays the Boy, <HI>I do not fear it, and am heartily glad we are got clear of them. They often ask'd me to enter, and go along with them, but I would rather chu&s;e to go with a</HI> Turk <HI>or</HI> In|fidel: <HI>Be&s;ides, was I &s;ure to peri&s;h, I could not leave you, when I con&s;ider how kind you have been to me, and &s;hall never forget it while I live: And I wonder,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that Mr.</HI> Hunter <HI>(i. e.</HI> the Mate) <HI>&s;hould be &s;o barbarous to leave you in this Extremity, as &s;ome of the Pirates here on Board told him, for he had acquainted them how kind you had been to him, and they refus'd at fir&s;t to enter him; and I believe they would not have let him enter, if it had not been for Capt.</HI> Ru&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take Leave briefly to mention in this Place &s;ome Account of this Boy: His Name is <HI>Potter;</HI> and he had &s;erv'd his Time to a Potter at <HI>King&s;ton upon Thames,</HI> and after, in a youth|ful Frolick, incon&s;iderately took a Fancy to go to Sea, and in order thereto &s;poke to a Man who pretended to be a <HI>Crimp, i. e.</HI> one that u&s;ed to provide Sailors with Voyages, Boys to Ma|&s;ters, &amp;c. and who undertook to help him to one. This Fellow &s;o manag'd the Matter, as to bind him a Plantation-Servant for <HI>America</HI> for the Term of five Years; and after the Boy was put on Board the Ship, and found how he had been
<PB N="101" REF="107">
trapann'd, he began to repent of his Voyage; but they made him believe they were at very great Charges for the <HI>Crimp</HI>'s Trouble and Pains, and for his Lodging, Diet, &amp;c. which they en|hanc'd to &s;uch a Sum, as they thought was above his Pur&s;e, and demanded to be reimburs'd of, before his Acquittal; &s;o that for want of Friends, or thro' Shame to apply him&s;elf to them, he was forc'd to acquie&s;ce, and was carry'd to <HI>Bar|badoes,</HI> where he was to be &s;old; and I under|&s;tanding the Lad's unhappy Ca&s;e, upon his Prayers, and Promi&s;es what a good and faithful Servant he would be, I bought his Time, and paid twelve Pounds for him of that Country Money: And, indeed, I always found him, not only true and faithful to my Intere&s;t, but af|fectionate to my Per&s;on, in&s;omuch, that it rais'd my Value for him, &s;o that I look'd upon him rather as a Child or Relation, than as a bare Servant.</P>
<P>But to return: In this Manner we pump'd and talk'd, &s;ometimes the one, and &s;ometimes the other, and gain'd upon the Ve&s;&s;el apace, in|&s;omuch, that before Day-light we had &s;uck'd her dry, and then we gave over. I forgot to mention, that <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> when he gave me the old Musket, and the Cartridge of Powder, gave me al&s;o two half Pound Papers of Tobacco, and <HI>Potter</HI> finding a &s;hort broken Pipe in the Cabbin, I &s;moak'd a Pipe, and lying too under my Fore|&s;ail all Night, when Day appear'd I look'd all about me, but lo&s;t Sight of the Pirates, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, made Sail in the Night, not caring I &s;hould know or &s;ee which Way they bent their Cour&s;e, for fear of giving an Information of them; for they were prodigiou&s;ly afraid of meet|ing with any of his Maje&s;ty's Ships, nor could they endure to hear any Talk of them: Though
<PB N="102" REF="108">
as &s;ecret as they thought they had kept the De|&s;ign of their intended Voyage from me, yet I perfectly knew it to be to go directly for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and to fetch as far to Wind|ward as they could, and then to crui&s;e along that Coa&s;t, and then &s;tretch over on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> where they promis'd them&s;elves Moun|tains of Trea&s;ure; from thence along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guana,</HI> and &s;o down among the I&s;lands, and to be at the latter End of the Spring on the Coa&s;t of <HI>North America,</HI> namely, <HI>Carolina, Vir|ginia, New-York, New-England,</HI> and &s;o by the Summer, to be on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Newfoundland; Ru&s;&s;el</HI> being the chief Scheme Projector in the Company.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Day broke out clear, I went to work, to find out, whether, by Chance or De&s;ign, they had left on Board any Thing fitting to eat or drink. I made my fir&s;t Search in the Cabbin, and &s;wept out of all the Bread-lockers, near the Crown of my Hat full of Du&s;t and Crumbs toge|ther, of Bisket, which I &s;ecur'd very &s;afe; and, in another Locker, I found four or five Hands of Tobacco, which, with the Pound given me by <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> made up a good Stock of that Commodi|ty. I found al&s;o, four or five &s;hort broken Pipes about the Cabbin, and they left my <HI>Fore-&s;taff,</HI> with only the <HI>Thirty-cro&s;s,</HI> having, as I &s;uppo&s;e, flung the other Cro&s;&s;es over-board. They left me al&s;o my Bedding, that being u&s;ele&s;s to them, there being not above three or four in any of the Ships, that lay either in a Cabbin or Hammock, namely, the Captain, Ma&s;ter, Steward, and Gun|ner, the re&s;t kennelling like Hounds on Deck, or where they could.</P>
<P>From the Cabbin, I went into the Hold, and rummaged there, and found in one Hog&s;head, a|bout the Quantity of ten Gallons, as near as I
<PB N="103" REF="109">
could gue&s;s, of Rum, and, in a Rice Cask, be|tween 20 and 30 Pound of Rice; and, &s;earching farther, I found a &s;mall Remnant of Flower in the Bottom of a Flower Cask&punc; I tried, and drained all the Water Casks, and found that to be our &s;carce&s;t Commodity, not being able to drain out of all of them, above two or three Pints.</P>
<P>Having &s;een all my Store of Provi&s;ions, and what I had, under God, to tru&s;t to of that Kind, I proceeded next to examine what Condition my Sails were in; and, I cannot &s;ay, but I took it more barbarous of them, to take my Sails from me, than their turning me away without Water or Provi&s;ions; at lea&s;t, I verily believe <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> thought I had not one Mouthful of any Sort of Eatable, nor one Drop of Water; they left me the &s;ame Jibb that was bent, and an old Fore-Sail, and an old Main-Sail that was much rent, torn, and rotten: I haled it upon Deck, and &s;pread it, but was at a &s;ad lo&s;s, how to contrive to mend it. I went down into the Cabbin, to &s;ee whether they had left any Needles or Twine, and found in the Twine-Locker, half a Dozen Skeins of Twine, but not one Sail-Needle. <HI>Potter,</HI> in the mean Time, was hunting in the Mens Che&s;ts and Lockers in the Steerage, and found in one of them, &s;ix Needles, and about a Pound and a half of Twine, and two Pawms; at which, I was ve|ry glad, and we went to work to mend the Main-Sail, but not having Stuff enough on Board, I cut off the fir&s;t Reef, and tabled down the Foot of it again, and &s;owed on the Bolt-Rope, and, with what I cut off, I mended it as far as it would go, and what more more was wanting, we mended with &s;ome old Canvas, which lay in the Mate's Cabbin, underneath his Bed, which, by good luck, was neither taken away, nor hove over-board.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="110">
We were three Days fixing and mending the Main-Sail, before we could fit it &s;o as to bend it; during which Time, we had light Winds, Calms, with variable Airs of Wind, cloudy, and mo&s;tly overca&s;t by Day, but clear and Star-light com|monly by Night, but &s;aw nothing like a Ve&s;&s;el all this Time, which was the chief and principal Thing we looked out for.</P>
<P>The fourth Day in the Morning, we bent the Main-Sail, but it proving calm, did &s;et it, but lay driving and rowling in the Sea, with only the Fore-Sail up, and had been &s;o ever &s;ince we were left by the Pirates; our daily Food was raw Flower, or Rice, with a Dram of Rum; laying up &s;afe, our little Stock of Water, till I had a little idle Time, and then I got &s;ome Flower up, and made as much Dough as my Water would, of which I made Cakes, and baked them on the Bottom of an iron Pot which I had on Board; and, after I had baked all, which was four little Cakes, I took one, and divided it among us three, but <HI>Potter</HI> was very unwilling to eat any, de&s;iring me, to keep the Bread all for my&s;elf, to take a Dram with, and &s;aid, he and the little Boy could eat raw Rice and Flower well enough, and that it agreed very well with him, and &s;o little <HI>Jack</HI> &s;aid too, and that they had not &s;uffer'd any Thing as yet, either as to Hunger or Thir&s;t. I told them, they mu&s;t take but a very little Rum to get down their Flower or Rice, for too much would make them dry; they &s;aid, they would not: &s;o we eat our Cake, and each of us took a &s;mall Dram of Rum, and &s;o had the be&s;t Meal that I made, &s;ince I came la&s;t on board of the Sloop.</P>
<P>This Night, I took two &s;everal Ob&s;ervations, one by the North Star, the other, by the Cocks Foot, and &s;ound my&s;elf in &s;eventeen Degrees of North Latitude, there being &s;ix Minutes Diffe|rence
<PB N="105" REF="111">
between the two Ob&s;ervations, but whether this happen'd by the Sett of the Current, the Eye, Horizon, or Declination of the Stars, I &s;hall not now examine nor determine. I had asked the Ma&s;ter of the Scooner, that Night I came away from them, What Di&s;tance he reckoned he was from the I&s;land of St. <HI>Antonia?</HI> and he told me, about &s;ixty-five, or &s;eventy Leagues, and the I&s;land bore Ea&s;t, half a Point &s;outherly.</P>
<P>Next Day we had a fre&s;h Trade, and I began to be in a Doubt which Way to endeavour for; <HI>Guinea</HI> being the nighe&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Land to fetch, e&s;pecially with a Trade, or even mo&s;t Winds; but I thought to my&s;elf, What can I do when I come there? I can neither have Credit, nor, if I had, could I, but by a meer Chance, except on Board a Ship, meet with any Thing there to refit me.</P>
<P>To go for <HI>Barbadoes</HI> was a long Run, and the Sea&s;on being then &s;o &s;ubject to Calms, and mo&s;t|ly light Winds, it might be a very tedious and long Run thither. If I endeavour'd to run for the I&s;lands of the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> I mu&s;t beat it up to Windward, if a Trade Wind continu'd, which would al&s;o be a long Time effecting; and be&s;ides, my Sails, all but the Jib, were &s;o bad, that it would be hazardous, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to make them hold out to beat up &s;ixty or &s;eventy Leagues right in the Wind's Eye; but tho&s;e I&s;lands of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> being the nighe&s;t Land by far, the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> which probably I might fetch, being the Di&s;tance of about two hundred Leagues, and <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the nighe&s;t I&s;land of <HI>America</HI> to us, being little le&s;s than &s;ix hundred Leagues di&s;tant from us; whereas the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, as I &s;aid before, were not above &s;eventy Leagues di&s;tant at mo&s;t, and the Winds in|clinable
<PB N="106" REF="112">
to &s;hifting, I concluded with my&s;elf, to endeavour for any one of tho&s;e I&s;lands, but chiefly that of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>The Trade blowing now about the North North-Ea&s;t Point, I &s;et Sail, and &s;tood to the Ea&s;tward with my Larboard Tack on Board, by which I &s;horten'd my Way to both the nighe&s;t Lands to me at once, namely the I&s;lands, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea;</HI> &s;o that if the Trade held fre&s;h, in about a Week's Time, I &s;hould be upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea;</HI> and if I run three or four Days as we now lay up, and then, if the Wind &s;hould veer to the Ea&s;tward, or Ea&s;t Southerly, then I &s;hould have a fair Chance, if not to fetch them, yet to fetch very nigh them; and I mu&s;t own, that only the Sight of Land would have been at this Time very plea&s;ant and reviving to our Hopes, which I cannot &s;ay as yet were any Thing fainti&s;h.</P>
<P>So &s;teering Ea&s;t-and-by-North, Ea&s;t, Ea&s;t-and-by-South, and Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, according as the Winds would &s;uffer us, I kept my Luff as nigh as with a full fair &s;tanding Sail &s;he would lie, being oblig'd not to touch or hank her up in the Wind, becau&s;e of my Main&s;ail's being le&s;|&s;en'd, as I mention'd before, by Rea&s;on I could not get Canvas to mend it withal, and therefore it may ea&s;ily be conceiv'd, that &s;he neither did hold the Wind, nor make the Way through, which &s;he would have done, had not her Sails been le&s;&s;en'd.</P>
<P>We &s;ail'd with a &s;teady fre&s;h moderate Gale of Wind, from ten a-Clock in the Morning 'till about eleven that Night, and then the Wind be|gan to die away, in&s;omuch, that between two and three in the Morning, it fell flat Calm, and &s;o continu'd all the Day following 'till about &s;ix in the Afternoon; after which Time, we had
<PB N="107" REF="113">
&s;ometimes light Airs of Wind, variable from the North We&s;t, round to the We&s;tward, and &s;o to the Southward, and to the South-South-Ea&s;t, with Thunder and Lightning, and it look'd as if there was a <HI>Turnado</HI> brewing; but we had none, neither had we any Rain, though it look'd very likely, and we very much hoped and long'd for it, but in vain. Tho&s;e variable light Airs of Wind would hold &s;ometimes half an Hour, other &s;ome le&s;s; &s;ome of them would be gone before we could get the Sloop's Head the right Way to make U&s;e of them; and between tho&s;e Airs be flat Calm, one Hour between, &s;ome two Hours, others two and a half, three, four, five, or &s;ix Hours Calm; and this Sort of Weather held us better than two Days. We made the be&s;t Ad|vantage we could to get as much as po&s;&s;ible to the Ea&s;tward; and in the&s;e two or three Days we got about twenty-five Leagues, according to my Judgment, to the Ea&s;tward; and, by Ob|&s;ervation, I found my&s;elf in &s;ixteen Degrees and fifty-&s;ix Minutes of North Latitude, and, by Computation, the I&s;land of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> bore about forty-&s;ix Leagues Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I ought before to have acquainted the Reader, That it was <HI>October</HI> the 19th, 1722, that I was taken by the Pirates, and the 29th Day of the &s;ame Month, they di&s;charg'd me, and I have brought down my Relation to the 7th of <HI>Novem|ber;</HI> in the Afternoon of which it falling Calm, I lower'd all my Sails, and let her lie.</P>
<P>The Night following we had one &s;mart Show|er of Rain, which made us fall to work to &s;ave every Drop we could, with as much Care and Caution, as an Alchymi&s;t would u&s;e in preparing his Grand Arcanum; and, by that Means, &s;av'd about a Gallon, be&s;ides &s;ome Draughts which we drank, and eat &s;ome Rice with it.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="114">
We had two or three other &s;mall Showers, but &s;carce enough thoroughly to wet the Deck and therefore could &s;ave no Water from them. We had al&s;o a great deal of Thunder and Lightening, but e&s;pecially in the great Shower.</P>
<P>About four a-Clock in the Morning, which was the 8th Day of <HI>November,</HI> it clear'd up, but continu'd calm, and the Sea very &s;mooth: When Day broke out I &s;pread the Main&s;ail, and dry'd that and the Fore&s;ail, both which wanted mend|ing again; and as &s;oon as the Main&s;ail was dry enough to &s;ow, I began upon that fir&s;t, which took me up the mo&s;t Part of the Day: In the mean Time, I order'd a Fire to be made, and boiling &s;ome Flower in &s;ome of the Water which we had &s;aved, we made a little Pap, which we eat, and it went down mo&s;t &s;weetly, taking a Dram of Rum after it, and were very thankful to Providence for this delicious Meal, it being very warm to our Stomachs. I re&s;olv'd to &s;ave the re&s;t of the Water for the like Occa&s;ion, that we might refre&s;h our Spirits with &s;o comfortable a Recruit, when we might grow faint by eating of the raw Rice or Flower.</P>
<P>It &s;till continu'd calm, with light <HI>Cat-Skins,</HI> as we commonly term them in the Sea Dialect, which are light Airs of Wind, not &s;preading perhaps above half a Mile, or &s;ome of them above the Quantity of an Acre of Ground on the Water; &s;ome perhaps reaching you, but dying away before you could &s;et your Sails, or get your Ve&s;&s;el the right Way with her Head; &s;ome dying away before they reach you, &s;ome going but ju&s;t pa&s;t you, and differ from a <HI>Bree&s;e,</HI> in that the latter &s;preads, or blows all over beyond what your Sight can reach, at lea&s;t on one Side; both being however &s;oft Winds, running on the Face of the Sea, mo&s;t commonly after, or in a
<PB N="109" REF="115">
Calm, making, as it were, a gentle Trepidation or Curling on the Surface of the Sea, and there|by giving the Part it &s;trikes upon a different Hue or A&s;pect, in&s;omuch, that you may &s;ee them at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance, before they reach you. Both the&s;e differ from a <HI>Gale</HI> in the Sea Notion, in the Strength of the latter: For a <HI>Bree&s;e</HI> blow|ing con&s;tant and a little brisk, it then lo&s;es its Name with us, and is call'd a <HI>Gale of Wind,</HI> and is di&s;tingui&s;h'd into <HI>moderate, hard,</HI> or <HI>taut,</HI> in Proportion to the Strength it hath increas'd to. And this Definition of a <HI>Catskin, Bree&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Gale,</HI> I thought proper to give for the Sake of &s;uch of my Readers, who are not acquainted with the Sea Language.</P>
<P>After I had mended up the Main&s;ail, I fixed the Fore&s;ail as well as I could, and about five a-Clock in the Afternoon, <HI>Nov.</HI> 10, a moderate Gale &s;prung up at Ea&s;t, and fre&s;hen'd up, and veer'd to the Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, and about ten or eleven at Night to the South-Ea&s;t. I made Sail with the Starboard Tack on Board to the North-North-Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t, and Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, according as the Wind veer'd, keeping my Luff, and endeavouring to get to the Ea&s;tward all that I could; for all that I gain'd to that Point, was &s;o much gain'd to Windward.</P>
<P>The Gale continu'd fre&s;h, yet moderate, &s;ome|times cloudy, &s;ometimes overca&s;t, but often|times in the Night clear, till the 12th Day; and then the Wind back'd to the Ea&s;tward, and by ten or eleven at Night back'd to the North-Ea&s;t, and North-Ea&s;t-and-by-North, that being the true Trade, which caus'd me to put about, and &s;tand to the South-Ea&s;tward, and about two a-Clock in the Morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 13. I ob&s;erv'd the North Star, and found my&s;elf in 19 Degrees and 37 Minutes North Latitude.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="116">
I &s;tretch'd away to the South Ea&s;tward 'till the 16th Day, and about ten in the Forenoon we &s;aw St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> which then bore from us Ea&s;t, half a Point northerly, and I judg'd we were about 18 or 19 Leagues di&s;tant from it, and it falling calm, we lay with our Sails all down, to &s;ave them from flapping.</P>
<P>The Calm continuing all Day, and the Sea be|ing very &s;mooth, about one or two in the After|noon <HI>Potter</HI> &s;aw a Shark, a voracious Fi&s;h, the De&s;cription of which is &s;o common, that I &s;hall not trouble my Reader with it. I look'd about, and &s;aw four more, but one &s;windging one, &s;wam clo&s;e up along Side, and almo&s;t even with the Waters Edge. <HI>Come, Come,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>we will, with God's Leave, have him by-and-by. Ay, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Boy, <HI>if we had our Shark-Hook, and a Piece of Beef or Pork. No Matter,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>we will have him pre&s;ently.</HI> So I got &s;ome Rags of &s;everal Colours, and made them fa&s;t together, being about the Bulk of a three or four Pound Piece of Meat, knowing there is hardly any Thing but what the Sharks will &s;nap at, and having made it fa&s;t to the End of a Rope, hove it over Board, and order'd the Boy to tend it as a Bait, or Decoy, and as the Shark came nigh it, to hale it up, and only play with him, to keep him about the Ve&s;|&s;el, while I got ready another Rope, at the End of which I made a running bowling Knot, and the Noo&s;e &s;o as to keep it open with one Hand, lowering the under Part beneath the Surface of the Water about two or three Foot, which was ea&s;ily done, by Rea&s;on it was flat Calm, and the Ve&s;&s;el had no Way at all, holding with my other Hand the &s;ingle Part of the Rope, ready when the Shark had wholly got his Head through the
<PB N="111" REF="117">
Noo&s;e, to hale, and thereby jam the running Knot taut about him, the Boy all the Time play|ing with the Bait before the Noo&s;e.</P>
<P>This fell out according to our De&s;ire; for the Shark coming up, and endeavouring to get the Bait, enter'd his Head through the Snare; but I, being over-eager, with a &s;udden Jirk, jamm'd the Noo&s;e clo&s;e, before the Neck Fins were got through, and haled his Head above Water as high as we could, making fa&s;t the Rope; but in two or three Plunges he &s;lipp'd his Head out, and immediately darted, as it were, out of Sight, after whom all the other Sharks pur&s;ued, think|ing, as I &s;uppo&s;e, he had got &s;ome Prize.</P>
<P>I was not a little concern'd at his E&s;cape, and blam'd my&s;elf for being &s;o ha&s;ty, as not to wait 'till his Head and Throat Fins had pa&s;s'd through the Snare before I had jamm'd it; but my Con|cern was di&s;&s;ipated by the fre&s;h Appearance of the &s;ame Sharks, as I &s;uppos'd, being the &s;ame Number, and, as nigh as I could gue&s;s, of the &s;ame Size; upon which I hove the Bait over|board again, and fix'd my Snare as at fir&s;t, and, as I &s;uppos'd by his Bigne&s;s, the &s;ame Shark again made to the Bait, but &s;hunn'd the Snare, and &s;o continu'd playing about it near three Quarters of an Hour, and then he darted at the Bait with &s;uch Swiftne&s;s, as if he had a De&s;ign, either to pa&s;s the Noo&s;e, or to make &s;ure of the Bait, which he had been deluded with &s;o long. I had as much Eagerne&s;s to catch him, as he had to catch the Bait, and my former Over&s;ight made me more wary and dextrous, and as &s;oon as I judg'd him enter'd far enough in the Noo&s;e, I jamm'd the Snare by a &s;udden Jirk of the Rope, and haled him up &s;o high, that his Head, with about a Quarter of his Bo|dy, was above Water, and finding him well
<PB N="112" REF="118">
&s;ecur'd, I let him hang &s;o, and gave him Time to tire him&s;elf, by beating again&s;t the Ve&s;&s;el, which he did now and then pretty hard.</P>
<P>When he had lain &s;o about an Hour, he began to be pretty quiet, now and then &s;triking and flouncing, but very weak and faint, &s;o that I thought I might venture to get him in, or, at lea&s;t, take him wholly out of the Water, and making a running bowling Knot on the End of another Rope, I ca&s;t it over his Tail Fin; I jamm'd it clo&s;e, and haled his Tail al&s;o above Water, and made it fa&s;t. He lay as if he had been dead, for about three or four Minutes, and then began to &s;trike &s;o hard with his Tail, that at every Stroke he made, the Ve&s;&s;el &s;hook, and fearing it would do it harm, I lower'd his Tail down in the Water again, and clapp'd a Tackle on the Rope that was about his Throat, he being &s;o heavy, we could not hale him by Hands any higher, and hoi&s;ted him up &s;o, that about a Foot and a half of the Tail Part, was in the Water, and let him hang till he &s;eemed to be almo&s;t dead, and then I hoi&s;ted him fir&s;t by one End, and then by the other, with the Tackle, till we got him in upon Deck, and then he began again to &s;trike &s;o hard with his Tail, as if he would have beat the Deck down, which I &s;oon put a Stop to, by cut|ting off about a Foot of his Tail Part, in which lies mo&s;t of this Fi&s;h's Strength: He then lay pret|ty quiet, and I put an End of a Boot-hook Staff into his Mouth, which he cru&s;h'd to Splinters, with as much Ea&s;e, as one could &s;queeze an Egg|&s;hell.</P>
<P>On cutting the Belly open, I found five young Ones, all alive, about the Bigne&s;s of a &s;mall Whiting; tho' I have hitherto call'd it <HI>He,</HI> accord|ing to an old Rule I had been taught at School,

<P>She had a very fine Liver, not blacki&s;h, nor dark reddi&s;h, as mo&s;t large Sharks have, but of a fair gray Colour, which I pre&s;erv'd. The whole Length of the Shark, was &s;omething more than eleven Foot and a half, and it mu&s;t needs be near upon 300 Weight. I &s;truck a Light by Help of the old Gun that <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> gave me at parting, which I then thought a u&s;ele&s;s Pre&s;ent, and accepted it only, becau&s;e I dur&s;t do no otherwi&s;e; but having neither Tinder-Box, nor Steel left me, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for us to get Fire without it; and though they left me the two Compa&s;&s;es that were in the <HI>Beetacle,</HI> there was not one Inch of Candle; which, however, in &s;ailing upon a Wind I did not much matter, except when any light Air, Bree&s;e, or Catskin, came in the Night, and the Sky was overca&s;t, and no Stars to be &s;een, more e&s;pecially if it was large, as any Way from the we&s;tern Hank, in which Ca&s;e I was forc'd to &s;upply the want of Candle, by blowing a Coal of Fire, whereby I could di&s;cern the Compa&s;s &s;o, as to get her Head the right Way.</P>
<P>Having, as I &s;aid, &s;truck a Light, and cau&s;ed a Fire to be made; the Pot was put on, with Sea Water, and, as &s;oon as our Fi&s;h was boiled, we eat heartily of it. After which, I cut the greate&s;t Part of the Shark into thin long Slices, and dried it in the Sun to pre&s;erve it, having no Salt on board.</P>
<P>About ten o' the Clock at Night, it looked black to the we&s;tward Board, and lighten'd much that Way, and about eleven, came up a light Air of Wind at We&s;t North-We&s;t, increa&s;ing to a moderate light Gale. I kept the Fire in, to have a Coal always in readine&s;s, that I might &s;ee the Compa&s;s every now and then, and &s;teer'd Ea&s;t

<P>It &s;till continuing black, and to lighten much in the wer&s;tern Board, about Midnight it began to Thunder, and rained a &s;mart Shower, of which, we &s;av'd about three Gallons; and about four o' the Clock in the Morning, it clear'd up, and the Stars &s;hew'd them&s;elves, which &s;av'd me the Trouble of blowing a Coal to &s;ee the Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>It continuing a fine plea&s;ant fre&s;h Gale, veering to the North-We&s;t; as &s;oon as it was Day, I &s;et the I&s;land of <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> which bore from me South South-Ea&s;t, about ten Leagues, the Gale continuing &s;till; but dying away by Degrees, about eleven in the Forenoon, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 17, it fell flat calm again, at which Time, <HI>St. Anthony</HI> bore South and by We&s;t, about eight Leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>I broil'd &s;ome of the Fi&s;h for Breakfa&s;t, and eat of it pretty heartily, which made us all very dry, but thank God we had a good Stock of Water, &s;o that now we could venture to drink a little. I made them put the Pot on, with &s;ome fre&s;h Wa|ter, and a little Rice to boil, and when the Rice was a little &s;oft, I had it thicken'd with Flower, and then put a Piece of the Shark's Liver into it, &s;hred &s;mall, which &s;oon di&s;&s;olv'd in it mo&s;tly to oil, as Fi&s;h Livers generally do; and this &s;erv'd us in the Room of Butter in our Ha&s;ty-pudding, which we Sailors u&s;ually call Pap, of which, we made a hearty and plea&s;ant Meal; and, as we had the Sight of Land, our Hopes were much re|viv'd. I lower'd down all my Sails, and over|haled them, and mended what was ami&s;s, the Calm continuing till two o' the Clock the Morning following, and it being a clear &s;erene Star-light Night.</P>

The Wind fre&s;hen'd up to a Gale about ten at Night, with Thunder and Lightning from the North-North-We&s;t Board, as was the Wind al&s;o. We had &s;everal &s;mall Showers of Rain, but &s;o &s;mall, that we could not &s;ave any Water from them; and as it thunder'd pretty much, and look'd very black and thick over the I&s;land of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> we judg'd that there fell abundance of Rain that Night there, which we heartily grudg'd them, and had rather it had fallen where we were, tho' we had under|gone a wet Jacket for it, and had no Cloaths to &s;hift us.</P>

Between twelve and one in the Afternoon, <HI>Nov.</HI> 20, &s;prung up a Gale at North-Ea&s;t, which increa&s;ing, &s;oon clear'd the Air, &s;o that I &s;aw the I&s;land of <HI>St. Nicholas,</HI> the Ea&s;t Point bearing We&s;t-South-We&s;t, and, by Suppo&s;ition, about eight or nine Leagues di&s;tant. I crowded all the Sail that I could make to get in to an Anchor before Night, the Wind &s;till in|crea&s;ing. About five in the Evening I doubled the Ea&s;t Point of the I&s;land; after which, when
<PB N="117" REF="123">
I came to luff up to keep the Land aboard, I found the Wind more Northerly, with very hard Flaws coming down the deep Gullies.</P>
<P>It being late in the Evening, and likely to prove, as indeed it did, a clo&s;e Night, and not having Day-light enough to gain, as I intended, the Road of <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> but fearing I might mi&s;s it in the Night, the high Lands being &s;o very like one another, I re&s;olv'd to anchor in <HI>Curri&s;al</HI> Road, it being nigher, as likewi&s;e to get off &s;ome Water, there being none to be had within two Miles of <HI>Paraghee&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>I was forc'd to make a Board or two, to fetch into the anchoring Place, and anchor'd in &s;ixteen Fathom Water, about a Quarter of a Mile from the Shore, ju&s;t about duski&s;h; and &s;aw a Fire and &s;ome People on the Shore.</P>
<P>After we had &s;tow'd our Sails, I hoi&s;ted the Boat out to get in the End of the Cable which the Pi|rates had &s;lipt, and put a Buoy on the Cable End, having di&s;cern'd it and the Buoy on the Anchor before I anchor'd, and for that Rea&s;on let go my Anchor nigh enough to it to get the End of it on Board. In order to which, I took a Quoil or two of &s;mall Rope with me in the Boat, to make one End fa&s;t to the Cable End, and to bring the other on Board; and &s;o by the &s;mall Rope to hale or heave the Cable on Board the Sloop, and ride moor'd 'till I thought proper to move from thence; but being &s;o few Hands, we were &s;o long a getting the Boat out, that Night came on, and it was &s;o dark, that I could not, with all my Diligence, find the Buoy; and &s;o was forc'd to come on Board again with the Boat, without effecting my De&s;ign.</P>
<P><HI>Potter</HI> then reque&s;ted me to let him &s;cull the Boat a&s;hore to get a Cag of Water, which I con|&s;ented to, but bid him be &s;ure not to make any
<PB N="118" REF="124">
Stay at all a&s;hore, but come off as &s;oon as he had got his Cask filled, which could not be long, the Water being clo&s;e to the Sea Side.</P>
<P>Soon after he was gone with the Boat, I was taken very ill with Faintne&s;s and Trembling at Heart, in&s;omuch, that I had much ado to get down to my Cabbin, which I attributed to my Overwatching and Working to get the Ve&s;&s;el in, and to our Drowthine&s;s the preceding Day, which was more exce&s;&s;ive than I had experienc'd ever &s;ince we parted with the Pirates. I bid the little Boy <HI>Jack</HI> keep a good Look-out for the Boat, and have a Rope ready to heave to her when &s;he came off; and to be &s;ure not to fall a&s;leep: All which he promis'd to ob&s;erve. I had not long lain down on my Bed, before I fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; and waking in a Surprize, I call'd to the little Boy, who not an&s;wering, I turn'd out, and came upon Deck, and found him fa&s;t a&s;leep in the <HI>Gangway.</HI> I awak'd him, and ask'd him, If the Boat was come on Board? He told me No; and looking about me, I could but ju&s;t &s;ee the I&s;land. This was as nigh as I could gue&s;s between twelve and one a-Clock, and I was not a little &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee my&s;elf thus again expos'd to the Sea, and that in a much wor&s;e Condition than before; my Spirits and Strength being much wa&s;ted; my Help gone; the Sloop daily growing more leaky; depriv'd of my Boat, and my Thir&s;t very great, which perhaps was increas'd by the Hopes I had of getting &s;ome Water, as well as owing to the great Fatigue of the preceding Day; but know|ing it in vain to de&s;pair, I re&s;olv'd to do what I could, and depend upon Providence for the re&s;t: However, I had two tough Jobs to manage, to wit, to heave the Anchor up, there being a whole Cable out to the better End; and to pump the Water out, which was in &s;ome Places above the
<PB N="119" REF="125">
Balla&s;t: And the latter being the more danger|ous, I concluded to begin with that fir&s;t, know|ing, that if I could &s;uck her dry, I &s;hould be in Hopes to keep her &s;o. Accordingly I went to work, and pump'd about half an Hour, in which Time I gain'd upon her con&s;iderably, and re&s;ting a while, took the other half Hour's Spell; after which I re&s;ted again, and &s;moak'd a Pipe of Tobacco, and took a Dram of Rum with a lit|tle raw Rice, and then fell to my Work of Pump|ing, and in five or &s;ix good Spells more, I &s;uck'd her; and then immediately apply'd my&s;elf to heave in the Cable; and to enable the little Boy to hold on, I made him a <HI>Jigger</HI> with a Block fix'd to the Cable, and a Rope reev'd through it, &s;o that having a double Purcha&s;e, he made &s;hift to hold on; tho' it was very tedious and &s;low. I hove up till about half the Cable was in, and then I went and took a Spell at the Pump, and pump'd her out dry; after which I re&s;ted, took a Dram, and &s;moak'd half a Pipe of Tobacco, and then went to heaving up the Anchor again, then to the Pump again, and the next Spell I got the Anchor up, and &s;tow'd it with the Pawm over the Gunnel; after which I &s;et Sail, and the Trade-Wind continuing to blow, I &s;tretch'd to the North-We&s;t, finding that I was able to keep the Sloop free, though &s;he made a great deal of Water; and I think I never found my&s;elf hear|tier or &s;tronger in all my Life. It was a great Concern to me to think of leaving my Boy and Boat at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> be&s;ides the Hopes of &s;up|plying my&s;elf with a Sail, which I could not ex|pect at any of the other I&s;lands; neither could I propo&s;e any Thing at any of the other I&s;lands, but the &s;aving mine and the Boy's Life, by run|ning the Sloop on Shore in &s;ome convenient Place; having no Boat to go a&s;hore for Water,
<PB N="120" REF="126">
or to get any of the Natives to go with me; for I could not expect that any of them would ven|ture to &s;wim off to me, without &s;ome previous Conver&s;ation, or Acquaintance, for fear I &s;hould be lurking there to &s;teal &s;ome of them away: Wherefore being determin'd to get to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> I &s;tretch'd, as I &s;aid before, to the North-We&s;t, and &s;tood till I brought the South-We&s;t Point of the I&s;land North-North-Ea&s;t from me about the Di&s;tance of &s;ix Leagues, and then I tack'd and &s;tood to the Ea&s;tward till I came a-brea&s;t of <HI>Curri&s;al,</HI> it being then about &s;ix in the Evening, and bearing North, di&s;tant about &s;even Leagues; and falling calm in a little Time after, I lower'd down all the Sails, and let her lie while that held, which was all Night, and till between eight and nine a-Clock the next Day.</P>
<P>I was tedious dry, but had no Help nor Means to quench it; and dur&s;t not eat any of the dry'd Fi&s;h, becau&s;e it made me more thir&s;ty, as I thought, than if it had been &s;alted.</P>
<P>This &s;eem'd to me the mo&s;t irk&s;ome Situation I had yet been in; for I was now, as it were, alone, having little or no Help in the little Boy, unle&s;s to hold the Helm while I was at the Pump, which was every half Hour, or oftner, or while I was doing any other Bu&s;ine&s;s; not daring to lie down to take a Nap, except a &s;hort one which I ventur'd to take during the Calm.</P>
<P>I &s;moak'd a Pipe of Tobacco or two, and al&s;o took a Dram, with a little Rice; and about nine o'Clock in the Morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 22, &s;ome &s;mall Catskins came on, and towards Noon &s;prung up a Bree&s;e at North-Ea&s;t: I then made Sail, and &s;tood to the North-North-We&s;t, and hoped to fetch <HI>Paraghee&s;i</HI> with that Board; but the Lee-Tide being made, I fell &s;hort by half a League,
<PB N="121" REF="127">
and fearing to be put again to Leeward of the I&s;land, and the Boy and I not being able to work the Sloop as we ought, I was re&s;olv'd to fetch in with any Anchoring-Place I could fetch, and &s;tretching in till I got the Shore clo&s;e on Board, I then edg'd away to a &s;andy Bay, call'd by the Natives <HI>Puttacko,</HI> where I anchor'd in &s;ix Fathom Water, in clear &s;andy Ground.</P>
<P>I had hardly been at an Anchor an Hour, when a Black came down to the Water-Side, and call'd to me. I an&s;wer'd him again. He &s;aid &s;ome|thing, and wav'd a long Pole, which he had with him; but the Wind blowing fre&s;h, I could hear nothing that he &s;aid to under&s;tand it, only <HI>Logo,</HI> which, in their Language, is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>pre&s;ently,</HI> or <HI>by-and-by.</HI> He went away; and in about half an Hour, another Black came down to the Water-Side, and waving his long Staff, as the other had done, &s;aid &s;omething, but I could hear only, <HI>Logo, Pre&s;to;</HI> and away he went.</P>
<P>I gave God Thanks for his Mercy, that I was once more got to an Anchor; and hoped my Boy would get &s;ome of the Inhabitants to help him to bring the Boat from <HI>Curri&s;al;</HI> but not ex|pecting him till the next Morning, I tended the Pump, in the Intervals &s;moaking a Pipe of To|bacco, &amp;c. About Sun-&s;et I &s;aw a &s;mall Boat come from <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> with &s;everal Blacks in her, rowing towards us, at which I was not a little rejoic'd.</P>
<P><HI>They came on Board to the Number of &s;even, all lu&s;ty &s;tout young Fellows, and brought with them two ten Gallon Casks full of Water, and bid me drink heartily of it. I drank twice; and they urging me to drink again, I told them, I had enough; at which they &s;eem'd to admire; and one of them &s;aid, If he had been &s;o long</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="128">
<HI>without Water, he could drink one of tho&s;e ten Gallon Casks of Water him&s;elf before he &s;hould be &s;atisfy'd. They told me,</HI> That the Prie&s;t and Governor of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> had &s;ent them on Board with that little Boat, which was the Prie&s;t's, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me to get my Sloop up to <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> in order to &s;ecure her, this being a very foul Road, and open to the Ea&s;terly Winds, which were very fre|quent at this Time of the Year, and always made &s;uch a Sea in this Bay, that it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible for the Ve&s;&s;el to be &s;afe there; and that the &s;unken Rocks (which lay a large Stones-Ca&s;t from the Shore) were &s;o &s;harp, that the be&s;t Swim|mer on that I&s;land could have no Hopes to &s;ave him&s;elf if the Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be put from her Anchor. <HI>I told them,</HI> I would &s;tay till my Servant came to me from <HI>Curri&s;al</HI> with the Boat.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> That could not be this Fortnight or three Weeks, the Wind being &s;et in a &s;trong Trade, which commonly at this Time of the Year, blew hard, and continued long: That they were &s;ent by the Prie&s;t and Governour to help me, and they thought it a very good Opportunity to get up to <HI>Para|ghee&s;i,</HI> as &s;oon as the windward Current was made, which would be in an Hour or two: That they were <HI>Homo's de Mare</HI> (i. e. <HI>Seamen)</HI> and two of them under&s;tood the Sea very well, and were Pilots. <HI>Which is a Title they give to any of their own People that can &s;teer or take Charge of any of their little Boats that go a Fi&s;hing. They told me,</HI> I need not be concern'd at my Boy's not being on board, for they were bred up Seamen from their Infancy, and could work the Sloop up to the Port of <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> or any where to the other I&s;lands, and would not have me trouble my&s;elf about it, but &s;moak my Pipe, or go and take my Re&s;t, for they would take Charge of the Ve&s;&s;el, and get her into the Port, and moor her &s;afe; For, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> we have been very much u&s;ed to take
<PB N="123" REF="129">
Charge of Strangers; <HI>an Appellation which they give to all</HI> Europeans, <HI>except</HI> Portugue&s;e, <HI>whom they call</HI> Branca<HI>'s, i. e.</HI> White<HI>'s, or</HI> white People, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e they were the fir&s;t white People they ever &s;aw; and, from whom, it's probable, they learnt, after the Manner of that Nation, to call all other People</HI> Strangers. <HI>I told them,</HI> I thought it was much better to &s;tay till the Day-tide, when they would be better able to &s;ee the Ropes, and &s;tand by the Work, then they could in the Night, they being Strangers to the Ve&s;&s;el; and be&s;ides, perhaps the re&s;t of their Company might not be &s;uch good Seamen, or be u&s;ed to working in Ve&s;&s;els, as they were.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> The re&s;t of their Company were not Pilots, as they two were, and could not work a Ve&s;&s;el as they could; but that they were good Sailors, and could endure Hard&s;hips, and do any Thing that they were commanded, as well as any white Sailor what&s;oever.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> If they could do that, it was &s;ufficient: but I had another Rea&s;on to offer, which might, I thought &s;way with them, to tarry till the Day-Tide, which was, That my Sails were very bad, and would not hold in any Thing of a taut Wind, and, if any Thing gave Way, we could better mend it, and &s;et it to rights by Day than by Night.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> No, it was much better to try for it in the Night-tide, by Rea&s;on it was always le&s;s Wind under the Land by Night, than by Day, neither did the &s;trong Flaws come down through the&punc; Gulleys, as they generally do in the Day.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;till in&s;i&s;ting in my Opinion, they told me,</HI> If my Sails were &s;o bad, as I repre&s;ented them, they would certainly not hold out to beat up in the Day Time; for I &s;hould not fail of having taut Winds blow off the Land, as well as hard Flaws come down the deep Gullies; and if I was not re&s;olved to weigh the next windward Tide coming on, they would all
<PB N="124" REF="130">
go on Shore, and not &s;tay on Board to run the Hazard of lo&s;ing their Lives, or being drove out to Sea; which might chance to happen on a Lee Tide, where they might have no Po&s;&s;ibility of fetching any Part of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider'd with my &s;elf a while, and found &s;ome Rea&s;on in what they &s;aid, and promis'd to weigh the next Spring-Tide, if they were &s;ure that we could get to <HI>Paraghee&s;i.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> That if they had not been very certain of that, I might be &s;ure they would not ven|ture to weigh from thence, and bid me not to trouble my&s;elf about &s;uch Thoughts; they would engage to get her &s;afe up and moored, long enough before the windward Current was &s;pent, even without one Knot of Sail, if we took the Advantage of the whole Tide.</P>
<P>I told them, I was glad to hear it was &s;o ea&s;y to get up to the Road, and wi&s;h'd it to fall out as they &s;aid.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, I need not at all doubt that; and about eight at Night, they told me the Current was &s;et to Windward, and that it was Time to weigh.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> That, according to the be&s;t Ob&s;erva|tions that I had made among the&s;e I&s;lands, the Cur|rent &s;hould not &s;et to Windward, till near ten o'Clock. <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> As for the Time, or Hours, they were ignorant of them, as being not u&s;ed to reckon that Way; but they could tell by the Ri&s;ing of the Moon, or by the Ri&s;ing and Height of &s;everal Stars; and they perfectly well knew, that the Tide was already made up to Windward, and, if I did not think fit to weigh now, they would all Hands go a&s;hore with their Boat, and believed I &s;hould have no more Help from the I&s;land, if I did not lay hold of &s;uch a fair Opportunity as now offer'd. <HI>So I told them,</HI> If they were &s;ure the Tide was made to Windward, they
<PB N="125" REF="131">
might go to work, and heave up the Anchor as &s;oon as they plea&s;ed. <HI>At which, they went to work, but would not let me heave at the Windlace, be|cau&s;e they &s;aid,</HI> they were Hands enough, and I need do no more, but order what I would have done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We got the Anchor up, and &s;tow'd it, and &s;et the Sails, and made a Trip off to the South-Ea&s;t, with a moderate Gale, and the Wind increa&s;ing, we &s;tood along Shore, and off withal, till we reckoned (as well as we could di&s;cern the Land to know it) to be abrea&s;t of a Place call'd <HI>Porto Ghuy;</HI> and then putting her a Stays, the Main&s;ail &s;plit &s;o in the Staying, that I was forc'd to lower it down, for fear it would blow all to Pieces; which &s;o daunted them, that they re&s;olv'd to quit the Sloop, and take to the little Boat which they came off in. This put me into as great a Streight, as any I had been in yet: We being then about two Leagues from the Shore, an ugly chopping Sea running, the Wind blowing fre&s;h, and it look|ing very black to Windward.</P>
<P>I then ob&s;erv'd, to add to the Misfortune, that the Blacks were almo&s;t all drunk; for when they fir&s;t came on Board, I made the little Boy fetch them a Bottle of Rum, and they ob&s;erving where he brought it from, were &s;o impudent, &s;eeing none but the Boy and I (notwith&s;tanding I for|bad them) to fetch it them&s;elves, telling me, <HI>That the lea&s;t they could expect, was to participate of what was in the Sloop, and that I &s;hew'd my&s;elf very un|grateful, as well as nigardly, to think much at any Thing they could eat or drink that was on board the Ve&s;&s;el.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did not begrudge them, but would have them only forbear drinking, till we had &s;ecured the Sloop, and then they &s;hould be very welcome to it all.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="132">
<HI>They had the Impudence to tell me,</HI> The Sloop was as much theirs as &s;he was mine, and al&s;o every Thing that was in her; that I was in Di&s;tre&s;s, and mu&s;t have certainly peri&s;hed, if they had not come off, and brought me and the Boy &s;ome Water.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That it was a Kindne&s;s, I own'd; but that I was in no evident Danger of peri&s;hing, when they came on Board, the Sloop being well at an Anchor, and the Pump &s;uck'd dry; and, Thanks be to God, I was in good Health, and therefore able enough, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to keep her free, till my Boy could come to me from <HI>Curri&s;al</HI> with my Boat. <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> That if I had waited there, till the Boy came to me with my Boat, I might wait long enough, for they did not believe, that any of the I&s;landers would venture to come down in the Boat with him, till the blowing Weather was over, which they did not expect to be, this two or three Months.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> If they left me now with the Boat, they would leave me in a much wor&s;e Condition than they found me in, when they came on Board; for they had drank all the Water that they brought on Board, and though I was de&s;titute of it when they came, yet I was at an Anchor nigh the Shore, and &s;hould always have been in Hopes of a Supply; and, at wor&s;t, could put the Sloop on Shore, and &s;o e&s;cape peri&s;hing that Way.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They could not &s;ee what I could do with the Sloop now, having no Sails to work her with; and to lie, and drive to Leeward all Night, and the next Day, till we got the Sail mended, we &s;hould be &s;o far to Leeward of the I&s;land, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to fetch any Part of the I&s;land, and then we mu&s;t either peri&s;h at Sea, or be forced to &s;ome Place, from whence they might never be able to get to their Families, or Homes, any more; and therefore, they were re&s;olved not to run that Hazard,
<PB N="127" REF="133">
but endeavour to get thither in the &s;mall Boat, which they had brought with them.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I thought the Hazard to be &s;o great, by venturing in the Boat, the Sea running &s;o high, and the Wind blowing &s;o hard, and right off the Shore, that it was next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility to row to the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>They replied,</HI> They were &s;atisfied it was a great Ri&s;que, but to abide in the Sloop, in their Judg|ment, was a greater; and, if they mu&s;t peri&s;h, would rather choo&s;e it in Sight of their native Land, than any where el&s;e; and if I thought fit to take my Chance with them, and they found we were too many for the Boat to carry, there were &s;everal among them that could, in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, depend on &s;wim|ming a&s;hore, and if Nece&s;&s;ity required it, they would, for the Security of the re&s;t, take to the Water and &s;wim; <HI>and one of them, who reckon'd him&s;elf the be&s;t Pilot, &s;aid,</HI> That if the Boat &s;hould be over|turn'd by the Waves, he would not have me to doubt, but what he could, and would, carry me &s;afe to the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That was a very tickli&s;h Chance to tru&s;t to, and that he would &s;oon be tired in the Water with &s;uch a Load as I &s;hould be, not being able to &s;trike one Stroke; and that I could expect no le&s;s, than to be quitted by him, rather than peri&s;h him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> That if I relied upon him, he would &s;ooner die with me, than leave me; be&s;ides, there were others in the Company, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that could &s;wim as well as he, and they would take Turns, and did not fear getting me and the little Boy &s;afe a&s;hore, though there was no Boat at all.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider'd, that all, or mo&s;t of this, proceeded from the Rum, the Fumes of which, had got in their Brains; and that it would have been as de&s;perate an Action to go with them, as to ca&s;t my &s;elf headlong into the Sea; the Boat being
<PB N="128" REF="134">
&s;o &s;mall, that nine or ten Hands were as many as &s;he could conveniently carry in &s;mooth Water, and what el&s;e could be expected, but to peri&s;h in &s;uch a Sea as then run?</P>
<P><HI>Whereupon I told them,</HI> I was re&s;olv'd to tru&s;t to Providence, and continue in the Sloop; and if they would do &s;o to, I doubted not, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, but they would by far, &s;tand the better Chance.</P>

<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> That if they were to peri&s;h in endea|vouring to get a&s;hore in the Boat, there could no Account be given of them, nor could their Friends know any more what was become of them, than if they had been lo&s;t in the farthe&s;t Part of the World. <HI>They an&s;wered,</HI> They were &s;ure that &s;ome of them &s;hould be able to get &s;afe a&s;hore, were both Sloop and Boat to go to the Bottom; and, if but one of them got &s;afe a&s;hore, it would be &s;ufficient to give an Ac|count, where, when, and how they were lo&s;t, which would be a great Satisfaction to their Friends; and it would be more plea&s;ing to them&s;elves, to think they &s;hould die &s;o near their own Homes.</P>
<P>I repeated to them the Danger they would ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to, and that there was hardly any Po&s;&s;ibility of their e&s;caping, if they ventur'd all of them to take to the Boat, whatever Chance might befal &s;ome of them; but 'twas all in vain; They &s;aid, <HI>Their Chance could be no better, if they &s;taid in a leaky Sloop, without Sails, Water, Provi|&s;ions,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Now you mu&s;t know, there is a va&s;t Difference, betwixt a <HI>&s;ung Ma&s;s,</HI> and a <HI>&s;aid Ma&s;s,</HI> as well in the Price, as the Efficacy; it being, according to tho&s;e People's Opinion, the Way of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to rai&s;e their Prices, in Proportion to the pretended Merit, or Efficacy of the Thing; now a &s;ung Ma&s;s, which they call <HI>Mi&s;&s;a Cantado,</HI> is &s;ung by the Prie&s;t, and the whole Choir, by Note, and is &s;o common in this I&s;land, that there are very few Males, but what are taught, tho' I don't know, that ever I heard that the Females learn'd to &s;ing.

<P>But to return, they concluded to take to the Boat, and accordingly, it was haled up along Side, and the Water hove out, Oars got in, (which were more like Paddles for a Canoo, than Oars for a Boat) and every Thing being got ready, the head Pilot, who took upon him to be Spoke&s;man for the re&s;t, told me, <HI>They were ju&s;t upon departing, and, if I thought fit to take my Chance along with them, I &s;hould fare as they fared, and no otherwi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I was re&s;olv'd to abide in the Sloop, and de&s;ired them, to tell my Boy on the I&s;land, if all, or any of them, &s;hould get &s;afe to the Shore, that I would endeavour to get to the I&s;land if I could; but if I &s;hould not come &s;oon, and he could light of an Opportunity, by any Ship's touching there, to be &s;ure not to &s;lip it, but make u&s;e of it to get off the I&s;land as &s;oon as be could; and al&s;o de&s;ired them to give my Thanks and Service to the Prie&s;t and Governor, for their Care in &s;ending A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But could wi&s;h they had not come on Board at all, &s;ince it happen'd as it did; for then I had &s;till been lying &s;afe at an Anchor. <HI>Into the Boat they &s;tepp'd, being all, or mo&s;t of them, very drunk, the Night very dark, and a brisk Gale of Wind; and, what with my Concern at my pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and the Darkne&s;s of the Night, I did not count them, nor mind whether all they that came on Board, went in the Boat or no.</HI></P>
<P>After they were gone, I began to con&s;ider what a comfortle&s;s Plight I was in, and repented that I let them weigh my Anchor, and heartily wi&s;h'd that the Boy and I were &s;afe a&s;hore with the other

<P>But, however, recollecting my&s;elf, that there was now no Remedy but Patience, I began to con|&s;ider, what Cour&s;e to take, to extricate my&s;elf out of this my pre&s;ent, and indeed hitherto, greate&s;t Misfortune; for my Main&s;ail was very much torn, my Twine almo&s;t expended, and I had no Help, nor any Body to con&s;ult with.</P>
<P>The Wind al&s;o, was now veering to the Ea&s;tern Trade, &s;o that it &s;eem'd a Hazard, whether I &s;hould be able to fetch with my Head-Sails, the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> or even St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which was the Lee|wardmo&s;t I&s;land that I was acquainted with of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> I&s;lands: The I&s;lands of S. <HI>Philip,</HI> and that al&s;o of St. <HI>John,</HI> I was utterly unacquainted with, they being very little, or not at all u&s;ed by our Shipping, the Sea-Draughts giving but a very imperfect De&s;cription of them, and the Waggon|ers and Pilots of tho&s;e Parts, being every whit as much, or more defective, making them both to be very dangerous; the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> to have few or no Inhabitants, the Roads, or Anchoring-Places, very bad; the I&s;land of St. <HI>John,</HI> to have one good Road, but very difficult for one unacquainted to enter, by Rea&s;on of the abundance of Rocks both &s;unken, and otherways; though mo&s;t of the&s;e De&s;criptions I found to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the Remainder of the Night, very &s;olita|rily, lying with my Head to the North North-We&s;t. It blew a fre&s;h Gale at North-Ea&s;t, cloudy, and &s;ometimes overca&s;t, hazy and windy-like to Wind|ward.</P>

In the Morning, as &s;oon as the Day broke out clear, I could &s;ee from me Ea&s;t North-Ea&s;t, the <HI>Terra Vermilia,</HI> as it is called by the Inhabitants, and the <HI>Punte de Vermilharee,</HI> North-Ea&s;t and by North. I wore the Sloop, and put her Head away to the Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, and made the Boy &s;teer her, the Wind being then about the North-Ea&s;t and by North. I kept her away one Point from the Wind, becau&s;e, having none but the Head-Sails, &s;he would make no Way through the Water if I kept her hankering up in the Wind; and then I went to work, to overhale the Main&s;ail, which I found &s;o torn, that it was pa&s;t mending, neither had I Twine enough to do it, if it had not; wherefore I la&s;hed the upper Reef Cringle down to the Boom, and tore, or cut the Sail, even at the Foot, all along the upper Reef; and where it wanted, I mended it as well as I could, and then &s;et it; by which Time, it was as nigh as I could gue&s;s, three or four o' Clock in the Afternoon, when, to my great Surprize, I heard the Voice of Men in the Hold. I went to the Hatchway, and looking down, I &s;aw three Blacks, who call'd to me, and asked me, <HI>If we were at an Anchor?</HI> I told them, <HI>We were at Sea.</HI> They asked me, <HI>If I could &s;ee any Land?</HI> I told them, <HI>I could not.</HI> They asked, <HI>Where I was de&s;ign'd to go to?</HI> I told them, <HI>I could not tell, it mu&s;t be where God plea&s;ed, and was re|&s;olv'd for the fir&s;t Land that I could make, and was in Hopes, we &s;hould fetch St.</HI> Jago.</P>
<P><HI>At which they &s;eem'd to rejoice, and got upon Deck, and one of them told me,</HI> That he was very well acquainted at the I&s;lands of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> St. <HI>Philip,</HI> and St. <HI>John,</HI> and that he had been at all of them, and round them al&s;o. That he had been three Years and Inhabitant on the I&s;land of St. <HI>John:</HI> That he was carried there from St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> in a <HI>French</HI> Pirate, who left him at the I&s;land of St. <HI>John,</HI>

<P><HI>I asked them,</HI> How it came, that they did not go with their Countrymen when they went away with the Boat?</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They were afraid the Boat would &s;ink before they could get to the Land; be&s;ides, the re&s;t of their Con&s;orts were very much in Liquor, which made them the more afraid, and thought I might know better than they, and therefore believ'd they cho&s;e the lea&s;t Danger, by &s;taying with me, and hop'd if we &s;hould be put to any &s;trange Land, that I would neither &s;ell them for Slaves my&s;elf, nor &s;uffer any Body el&s;e to do &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> They might depend upon it, that they that made Slaves of them, &s;hould make one of me al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They came fir&s;t on Board, with an Intention to &s;erve me, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting me to gain the Port of <HI>Paraghee&s;i,</HI> which my want of Sails, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> had prevented; but that now they would gladly do any Thing that I bid them, and de&s;ired, that I would accept them as Servants.</P>
<P>They added, <HI>That they were very &s;orry their Comrades went away and left me, after they had drank off my Rum,</HI> though, by the Way, they them&s;elves, as they afterwards told me, when they had got fafe on Shore, had al&s;o drank plentifully of it, and that was the chief Rea&s;on of their &s;tay|ing behind, having drank in the Hold till they fell dead drunk a&s;leep, though now they pretended it was out of pure Love and Re&s;pect to me, and they would never leave me, but continue with me al|ways Servants, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140">
<HI>They asked me,</HI> What I thought of the Boat? and whether tho&s;e that went in her, were got &s;afe a&s;hore or no? <HI>I was willing to encourage them, and told them,</HI> I believ'd not, and was much afraid they were all peri&s;h'd.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They did believe as much, and reckoned them&s;elves happy in not accompanying them in their ra&s;h Folly; for they thought it could not be right, be|cau&s;e I was &s;o aver&s;e to it, and they were all &s;ure, that I knew a thou&s;and Times better then any of them, <HI>and abundance of &s;uch Parlavers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They al&s;o &s;aid,</HI> They had Relations, &s;ome on this I&s;land, &s;ome on t'other; and if we could but arrive at this, or that I&s;land, oh! I &s;hould want for nothing, but &s;hould be plentifully &s;upplied with every Thing the I&s;land afforded.</P>
<P>Night coming on (which prov'd clear over Head, but very hazy all round the Horizon) and it con|tinuing a taut fre&s;h Gale at North-Ea&s;t, I &s;teer'd Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, and South-Ea&s;t-and-by-Ea&s;t, all Night, and the next Morning, when the Day broke out clear, we &s;aw the Peek of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Phi|lip,</HI> in the Form of a Sugar-Loaf above the Haze. We could not &s;ee any of the other Parts of the I&s;land, though very high Land, the Haze &s;eeming to be elevated above the imaginary Horizon, about twenty Degrees; and the Peek &s;eem'd to have its Head elevated to thirty Degrees or more.</P>
<P>The Blacks were very much rejoiced at this Di&s;covery of Land, but could not throughly give Credit to their own Eyes, and u&s;ed every now and then, to di&s;tru&s;t and fear, it was not certainly Land that we &s;aw, and then they would come and ask me, to remove their di&s;tru&s;t: And &s;o often repeated their Que&s;tions, that I was throughly tired with their Interrogations.</P>
<P>I was in Hopes of &s;eeing St. <HI>Jago,</HI> but it was &s;o hazy, that I could not, though if it had been any

Thing clear, we might have &s;een it very plain; the Peek of St. <HI>Philip</HI> bore, when we &s;aw it, from us South-Ea&s;t-and-by-South; and, as the Sun ro&s;e, the Haze was more elevated by his attractive Rays, that the Peek was altogether obfu&s;cated, and hid from our Sight; which increa&s;ed the Blacks doubt|ing and confirmed their Opinion, that it was not real, but imaginary Land we had &s;een, neither could I per&s;wade them, though I was as certain as was po&s;&s;ible to be by the Sen&s;e of Seeing; but they were very much down in the Mouth.</P>
<P>I encourag'd them all that I could, by telling them we &s;hould be in with the Land before Night, to which they gave little Credit, &s;uppo&s;ing, as they told me afterwards, that I only told them &s;o, that they might not be ca&s;t down.</P>
<P>I found, by the Bearing of the Land from me, with Con&s;ideration to the Cour&s;e I had &s;teer'd, that the Current &s;et &s;trong to the We&s;tward, and therefore, notwith&s;tanding the I&s;land bore South-Ea&s;t-and-by-South, I re&s;olv'd to &s;teer South-Ea&s;t-and-by-Ea&s;t, being a&s;&s;ur'd that the Current mu&s;t needs &s;et us down very near the I&s;land, be|fore we could run the Length of it; however, I knew we could not run &s;o far wide of it, as not to &s;ee it, let it be never &s;o hazy, and was re|&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to come in with it on the Weather Side, as being then capable of running down along the Shore at my Lei&s;ure, and view the Coa&s;t narrowly, to find &s;ome convenient Road or Bay to anchor in, or, at lea&s;t, to run the Sloop on Shore in, to &s;ave our Lives, if we &s;aw no Way or Pro&s;pect of doing better.</P>
<P>The Blacks tended the Pump, and told me, If the Boy and I would but &s;teer, they would do that, or any Thing el&s;e I bid them do, that they were able; which was a great Help, as well as Encouragement to me, to what it was when the

Boat, and, as I then thought, all the Blacks had left me and the Boy to &s;hift for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>However, they continu'd very unea&s;y, and continually one or other of them was asking me, <HI>Whether I thought that was Land that we had &s;een? Whether I was &s;ure of it? And how long I thought it might be before we &s;hould get Sight of it again,</HI> &amp;c.? But to their great Satisfaction, as well as mine, we &s;aw it again, and &s;eem'd to be very near it, the Top of the Peek being, as I &s;uppos'd, 45 Degrees, or thereabouts, elevated above the Horizon; and we could &s;ee the Top of the great Mountain, which lies on the North-We&s;t Side of the Peek, which is the highe&s;t, excepting the Peek, on that I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Land &s;till continu'd di&s;cernible when the Haze was thin, which we could perceive to fly very fa&s;t over it, and this was about four in the Afternoon, and the Peek then bore South-South-Ea&s;t a little Southerly, and I then &s;teer'd right down for the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>The Blacks were exceedingly rejoic'd at this Sight, and mighty inqui&s;itive to know,</HI> How long it would be before they could get a&s;hore? <HI>I told them,</HI> I was afraid it would be very difficult to get a&s;hore on this I&s;land, having no Boat; be&s;ides, I thought there were but very few Inhabitants there, and therefore probably we might be in Danger of faring hard, or, perhaps, fami&s;hing; and that I was inform'd the I&s;land of St. <HI>John</HI> was better; for that there were more Inhabitants on it, and pro|bably we &s;hould there have a better Chance to find Nece&s;&s;aries to &s;u&s;tain Nature, till it pleas'd God an Opportunity offer'd for us to get off the I&s;land; and that, be&s;ides, there was in it a good Harbour, if we &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to find it.</P>

<P><HI>He added,</HI> That be was at that I&s;land when a <HI>French</HI> Ship was there trading for Mules, &amp;c. and he ob&s;erv'd that the Sea run &s;o high for &s;everal Days together, that they were not able to &s;end their Boat a&s;hore &s;ometimes for three or four Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and u&s;ed to cur&s;e the I&s;land very often, becau&s;e the Roads were &s;o bad.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of St. <HI>John, he &s;aid,</HI> was indiffe|rently plenty, and had a Hundred or more Inhabi|tants on it when he was there, which, as nigh as he could gue&s;s, was about twenty Years pa&s;t, and had a very good Harbour, which he was po&s;itive he could direct me into as well as to any Part of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where he was born, and had liv'd all his Life, except that Time that he was carry'd off by the <HI>French</HI> Pirate <HI>Maringwin,</HI> who left him at St. <HI>John</HI>'s about three Years; and that he had been round both the I&s;lands, and had been &s;everal Times, at &s;everal Places of the&s;e two I&s;lands, as well as St. <HI>Jago,</HI> a&s;hore with the &s;aid Pirates Boat, who always took him with them as a Lingui&s;t for them, by which Means he was very well acquainted, both

<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He would engage his Life to do it; <HI>whereupon I told him,</HI> I would lie by all Night to Windward of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> and a little before Day would bear away for the I&s;land of St. <HI>John,</HI> that we might have Day-light to get into the Harbour, and be the better able to &s;hun the Rocks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;eem'd very much di&s;&s;atisfy'd at this, fearing, if they did not directly get there, when Night came on they &s;hould lo&s;e Sight of the Land, and never attain it more, and had a great Cabal and Murmuring among&s;t them&s;elves; after which, <HI>Nicholau Verde</HI> told me, <HI>That he thought I had better run for the I&s;land of St.</HI> John <HI>directly, being &s;ure we &s;hould get Sight of it before Night, and that then he would engage his Life to carry the Ve&s;&s;el &s;afe into the Harbour let it be never &s;o dark.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I did not think it proper, neither would it be &s;afe; for the Weather being hazy, and it being almo&s;t Night, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for us to get Sight of St. <HI>John</HI>'s before Night, and &s;o per|chance we might, by the Uncertainty of the Current, mi&s;s the I&s;land, e&s;pecially as we had no Candle on Board to &s;ee how to &s;teer a direct Cour&s;e by the Compa&s;s.

<P><HI>Upon his in&s;i&s;ting,</HI> That he was &s;ure, if he could once &s;ee the I&s;land, if it was never &s;o dark be could find the Way into the Harbour; <HI>I told him,</HI> I would not venture in the Night; but if he was &s;o po&s;itive he knew the Way into the Harbour in the

<P><HI>Whereupon they all &s;aid,</HI> That if I would not run in now directly, they were &s;ure we &s;hould lo&s;e Sight of the Land before the next Morning, and then what could they or I either expect but to peri&s;h?</P>

<P>So about half an Hour pa&s;t &s;ix in the Evening, it being then duski&s;h, I laid the Sloop a-try un|der her Fore&s;ail, with her Head to the North-We&s;tward, the Peek then bearing South-South-Ea&s;t, a little Ea&s;terly, and the North-Ea&s;t Point of the I&s;land South-South-We&s;t, a little We&s;ter|ly; the Ve&s;&s;el came up to North-and-by-We&s;t, and fell off to the North-We&s;t-and-by-North.</P>

<P>I now and then catch'd a Nod as I &s;at on the Deck, and then took a Spell at the Pump, and then a Pipe of Tobacco, and &s;o I pa&s;s'd the Night away till about four o'Clock the next Morning; at which Time I &s;et the North Point of the I&s;land, and it then bore South, a little
<PB N="140" REF="146">
Ea&s;terly, di&s;tant, according to my E&s;timation, about four or five Leagues.</P>
<P>I then call'd to the Blacks to come up and help me to hoi&s;t the Main&s;ail, for that it was Time to make Sail, and bear away for St. <HI>John</HI>'s; but they would neither come up, nor an&s;wer, &s;up|po&s;ing, as afterwards they told me, that I did it only to get them to pump, concluding, that we were out of Sight of all Land, and &s;hould ever remain &s;o: So I was forc'd to bring the main Ha|liards to the Windlace, and make the Boy hold on, while I hove the Main&s;ail up, as much as we had of it, which was not above half a Sail, it be|ing &s;horten'd three Reeves.</P>
<P>After I had got the Main&s;ail up, I made the Boy put the Helm a Weather, and hoi&s;ted the Jib, and &s;teer'd away for the North Point of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> keeping it a Point or better open upon the Larboard Bow.</P>
<P>After we had been under Sail about an Hour, or &s;omething better, they hearing me cun the Boy at the Helm, began to have a Mind to &s;ee or hear what I was doing; <HI>Nicholau</HI> call'd to me, and ask'd, <HI>Whether I &s;aw the Land?</HI> I told him <HI>Yes; and that we were very near the Point of the I&s;land (which was under our Lee-bow) when they went down, and were now &s;ailing directly for the I&s;land of St.</HI> John.</P>
<P>Upon this good News they all &s;tarted up, and came upon Deck, and as &s;oon as they &s;aw we were &s;o near the Land, contrary to what they ex|pected, and even contrary to what they all thought was po&s;&s;ible, they were very much rejoic'd and reviv'd, and immediately went to the Pump, and pumped the Ve&s;&s;el out dry; though there was not much Water then to pump out of her; for I &s;el|dom let her &s;tand half an Hour without pumping, dreading to let too much Water be in her at a

Time, for fear a large Spell would make me thir&s;ty; and having nothing to quench my Thir&s;t on Board, and very little to allay Hunger, the Rice and the Rum being almo&s;t gone, and the dry'd Shark I dar'd not eat of, it always making me very thir&s;ty whenever I eat any of it.</P>
<P>By this Time 'twas Day, and doubling the Point of the I&s;land, I haled more Southerly a|long the Coa&s;t of the I&s;land, till we got abrea&s;t of that Part of St <HI>Philip</HI>'s, call'd by the Inhabi|tants <HI>The Ghors,</HI> which is very much noted for the exceeding hard and &s;udden Gu&s;ts of Winds that come off there, the nearer to which, the harder they are, and reach off the Shore about four Leagues, and then lo&s;e their fierce Violence. The&s;e Gu&s;ts are but weak in the Night, and ra|ther weaker in the Morning till about ten in the Forenoon, at which Time the Sun ri&s;ing above the Mountains, they blow prodigious hard till about four or five in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>We were, when abrea&s;t of it, about two Leagues from the Shore, and it being &s;o early in the Morning, had not much of them, though it could not well have damag'd us for the Quantity of our Sails that we had &s;pread; but the Rotten|ne&s;s of them render'd them unable to have held out the Force or Violence of &s;uch of them, as might be counted very moderate, in re&s;pect of the more violent Flaws.</P>
<P>We could &s;ee the I&s;land of St. <HI>John</HI> very plain, and I &s;teer'd directly for it; and, in a little Time, rai&s;ed the little I&s;lands which lie on the North-Ea&s;t Point of the I&s;land, and by the Natives call'd <HI>Ghuys;</HI> within which lies the be&s;t Road or Harbour in the I&s;land, call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Fuurno,</HI> which in their Language &s;ignifies <HI>an Oven;</HI> &s;o call'd, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the &s;everal Caves which are thereabouts.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="148">
As &s;oon as we made the little I&s;lands, I, by the Direction of my Pilot <HI>Nicholau,</HI> &s;teer'd di|rectly for the Ea&s;termo&s;t of them, which was the highe&s;t, and kept it a little open on the Star|board Bow, and &s;o run till we were got within about half a League of the Ea&s;t End of it, and then kept along the I&s;land till we were abrea&s;t of the We&s;t End, which hath a high rocky Point, almo&s;t like a Sugar-Loaf, with the Top broke off, not flat, but a little rounding. When we were got abrea&s;t of the la&s;t mention'd Point, we then &s;teer'd for the North-Ea&s;t Point of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, by the Natives call'd <HI>Ghelungo,</HI> which bears from the We&s;t Point of the Ea&s;twardmo&s;t of the little I&s;lands about South-We&s;t-and-by-South, di&s;tant about a large League and a half, or two Leagues.</P>
<P>Then I began to ask my Pilot <HI>Nicholau, Where|abouts the Harbour was?</HI> who very readily &s;hew'd me, as he thought; but when we had &s;ailed a little farther, then he &s;hew'd another Place, and as we ran along, he &s;till was &s;hewing me a new Place for the Harbour; in&s;omuch, that I plainly &s;aw he was utterly ignorant: for every new Point of Land that we rai&s;ed, &s;till that was the Point, he &s;aid, that made the Har|bour; in&s;omuch that the other Blacks began to chide at him, and tell him, <HI>That they believ'd he knew nothing of it; and that either he never had been at the I&s;land of St.</HI> John, <HI>or el&s;e this that we now &s;aw, mu&s;t be &s;ome other Land that he had never &s;een.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I was po&s;itive this was the I&s;land of St. <HI>John;</HI> and that they might certainly credit me; for I could not be mi&s;taken in the I&s;land, whatever was the Matter that <HI>Nicholau</HI> could not remember which, or where the Harbour was.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149">
<HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They could not tell the Meaning of it, for the Land was &s;o remarkable, that any Body, that ever had &s;een it but once, might know it again.</P>
<P>Nicholau <HI>&s;aid,</HI> He was &s;ure it was the I&s;land of St. <HI>John,</HI> but it was &s;o long &s;ince he had been there, that he could not, he &s;aw plainly, know the Harbour at a Di&s;tance; yet he was &s;ure he &s;hould know it when he came to it.</P>
<P>I asked him, <HI>If he was certain we were not pa&s;t it already?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>He was &s;ure we were not,</HI> and &s;o I kept on all along the I&s;land, within about a Mile or le&s;s, of the Shore, that I might be &s;ure not to mi&s;s it; and, at la&s;t, we di&s;cover'd it; but then we were got to Leeward, for the Harbour lies round a Point, and turning up to Windward, &s;o that you cannot perceive its Opening, till you are pa&s;t it; and under the Land, the Wind is always light, though it blows never &s;o hard a Trade in the Offin, which makes a &s;hort popling Sea, and in a light Wind, makes it very difficult, for any Ve&s;&s;el to turn up under the Shore; but impo&s;&s;ible to us, our Sails being &s;o &s;mall, that the Ve&s;&s;el would &s;carce an&s;wer her Helm in that popling &s;hort Sea; and be&s;ides a &s;trong Lee Current, which we perceiv'd to hor&s;e us down to Leeward apace.</P>
<P><HI>I asked my Pilot</HI> Nicholau, Whether there was no Place to Leeward, that we might Anchor at? <HI>He told me,</HI> No, and that if I did not put the Sloop a&s;hore before I drove to Leeward of <HI>Punta de Sal,</HI> I &s;hould not be able to get a&s;hore, but we mu&s;t all of us certainly peri&s;h. <HI>I asked him,</HI> What he would advi&s;e me to do? <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He would have me put the Sloop a&s;hore upon the Rocks, and every one make their E&s;cape as they could.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> Neither I nor the Boy could &s;wim, and we &s;hould run as great a Hazard that Way, having no Boat, as by driving to Sea again.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150">
<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> As for his Part, &s;ince he was got &s;o nigh the Shore, if I would not put the Sloop a&s;hore my|&s;elf, they could, and would, whether I wou'd or no.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I had a Gun ready loaden for any, or all of them, that &s;hould offer to do any Thing on Board of my Ve&s;&s;el again&s;t my Will. <HI>Upon which Words, he jump'd over-board, &s;aying,</HI> He wi&s;hed me well, and the re&s;t that were with me, but would endeavour not to peri&s;h him&s;elf; <HI>and away he &s;wam a&s;hore.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The other Blacks told me,</HI> They could not &s;wim well, and dared not to venture; but if they were &s;ure they could &s;afely &s;wim a&s;hore, they would not leave me, till I could al&s;o &s;ecure my&s;elf; but withal, they hoped I did not de&s;ign to carry them away to Sea without any Water or Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I cared as little for &s;tarving, or pe|ri&s;hing at Sea, as they could; neither did I de&s;ign to go in this Condition any farther, than to find a con|venient Place to Anchor the Sloop in; and, if not, to put the Sloop a&s;hore in the be&s;t Manner, and at the mo&s;t convenient Place I could find for our &s;afe e&s;caping a&s;hore.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> Nicholau &s;aid, if you did not put the Sloop a&s;hore, before you drove pa&s;t that Point, <HI>(pointing to</HI> Punta de Sal) you cannot get a&s;hore at all.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> Nicholau knew nothing of the Mat|ter, as they might ea&s;ily perceive, by his not know|ing the Harbour before they were pa&s;t it, and too late; for, <HI>continued I,</HI> had he known it, we had now, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, been &s;afe in and moored; and, perhaps, I might have &s;o recruited here, as to have been able to put you all a&s;hore at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> again.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="151">
At which, they began bitterly to cnr&s;e <HI>Nicholau,</HI> and to wi&s;h that he might be drowned before he got a&s;hore; or, if he did get thither &s;afe, that he might break his Neck down the Rocks before he got quite up.</P>
<P>I told them, <HI>I was not out of Hopes yet, and was almo&s;t &s;ure I &s;hould find an Anchoring-Place about</HI> Punto de Sal, <HI>and, with God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, would get them all &s;afe a&s;hore, if they would pump the Wa|ter out of the Sloop;</HI> for our Eagerne&s;s of looking out for the Harbour, and Di&s;appointment in mi&s;&s;ing it, had made me neglect the Pump, and &s;he had a great deal of Water in her, in&s;omuch, that with her rowling in the Sea, the Water wa&s;hed over the Balla&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>However, my black Ship-Mates told me flat and plain,</HI> They would not pump, nor do any Thing el&s;e, till they &s;aw whether they &s;hould live or die; and, as &s;oon as the Sloop was &s;afe at an Anchor, they would then Pump, or do any Thing that I would de|&s;ire them.</P>
<P><HI>Ay, &s;aid I,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e to get a&s;hore, and leave me as <HI>Nicholau</HI> has done.</P>
<P>Hereupon they made bitter Imprecations upon them&s;elves, if ever they would leave me, or the Sloop, till I thought fit my&s;elf; but all that I could do, could not per&s;wade them to pump one Stroke.</P>
<P>I run down along Shore, and haled in clo&s;e to <HI>Punto de Sal,</HI> in&s;omuch, that haling about the Point, a Man might almo&s;t have jumped a&s;hore.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps be thought, that I was Fool-har|dy for venturing &s;o nigh the Rocks, without being acquainted with them; but if the Nece&s;&s;ity I lay un|der, and the Rea&s;ons that induced me to do &s;o, be con&s;idered, I think I may be clear'd on that Head; for that Point being the Leewardmo&s;t Land of the I&s;land that I could &s;ee, I did not know how the Land might trench away on the other Side of it: So, that,
<PB N="146" REF="152">
as far as I knew, I might not be able to hale in with the Land on the other Side of the Point. I al&s;o ob&s;erv'd it to be a &s;mooth &s;teep Rock, yet not &s;o &s;mooth but what it &s;eem'd po&s;&s;ible to get up it, and generally &s;uch Sort of Rocks are &s;teep too; &s;o that my Intention was, as &s;oon as I had open'd the Land beyond the Point, if I had no Pro&s;pect either to hold the Shore on Board, or of an Anchoring-Place, to run her &s;o nigh the Point, if Nece&s;&s;ity &s;o requir'd, that with the Way that the Ve&s;&s;el had, I could &s;heer her to the Rock, &s;o that the Boy and I might jump a&s;hore; for to drive to Sea as now we were, if we could any Ways avoid it, would be too great a Pre|&s;umption.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I open'd the Land on the other Side of the Point, I di&s;cover'd a &s;mall deep little Bay, and luffing in about it, having my Lead ready upon Deck, I hove a Ca&s;t, and had thirteen Fa|thom Water: I hove again, and had twelve Fa|thoms, the Northern Stream being made, which &s;ets &s;trong into the Bay, and round the Point, check'd me in mainly. I hove the Lead again, and had ten Fathoms; the next Ca&s;t I had nine, and then I cockbilled my Anchor, and heaving one Ca&s;t more, I had eight Fathoms and a half. I not liking the Shore well, which to me look'd very ragged, which mo&s;t-an-end denotes foul Ground, though, by the Lead, it &s;eem'd to be both even and clear; I let go my Anchor in eight Fathom Water; and as &s;oon as I had veer'd Cable enough to hold the Sloop, and &s;tow'd the Sails, I took and rigg'd both Pumps, and took hold of one Pump-break my&s;elf, and bid them take hold of the other, and we &s;hould &s;oon pump her out: But they &s;aid, <HI>They wanted Water, and were very dry, faint, and hungry, and unable to pump; but</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="153">
<HI>they would &s;wim a&s;hore, and &s;ee for &s;ome Water, and come on Board again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> There was no Place nigh us, I be|liev'd, that had any Water; neither did it look as if there were any; and therefore de&s;ir'd them to wait with Patience till the Morning, and to be &s;ure &s;ome of the Inhabitants would come down to us, and per|haps might bring &s;ome Provi&s;ions too, &s;ince they mu&s;t needs know and bear of our Nece&s;&s;ity by <HI>Nicholau,</HI> who I was &s;ure would not fail to give them an Ac|count who we were, and of our Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They did not know but <HI>Nicholau</HI> might be drown'd, or devour'd by &s;ome Fi&s;h before he got a&s;hore, and that they would not tru&s;t to that: That it might be, the Sloop would drive to Sea again in the Night.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> They need not fear that; and if we found no Relief before the next Noon, I my&s;elf would hale the Sloop in, and go with them a&s;hore.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They would go a&s;hore and get &s;ome Water, and would come off to me in the Morning betimes, and bring me &s;ome, if I did not go away with the Sloop in the Night.</P>
<P>So away they went overboard, and &s;wam a&s;hore, which was not far, being about a large Stone's Ca&s;t, and never came to me more.</P>
<P>It was Evening, and almo&s;t du&s;ki&s;h, when they went away; but I could &s;ee &s;ome of the Natives up aloft on the Tops of the Rocks, but they did not come down that Night.</P>
<P>So the little Boy and I were again left alone to &s;hift for our&s;elves as well as we could; and after I had put &s;ome Service in the Haw&s;e, I fell to work at my old Trade of pumping, and was heartily tir'd before I got her &s;uck'd; for being nigh the Shore, &s;o that I could have made &s;hift to have &s;aved the Boy and my&s;elf, I was not &s;o much afraid as when I was at Sea; which Fear, I found
<PB N="148" REF="154">
now, had made me &s;o vigorous, and I thought, &s;trong, that I was not then tir'd, as I could per|ceive, at all; but now it &s;eem'd not only tire&s;ome, but tedious and irk&s;ome, in&s;omuch, that I began almo&s;t to de&s;pair of being able to hold out without &s;ome other A&s;&s;i&s;tance; however, with much to do, I, after a long and tedious pumping, got her to &s;uck. She had as much, or more Water in her, than &s;he had when the Pirates fir&s;t left me; but then I had my bigge&s;t Boy to help me, who could pump as much as I could, and then I was more &s;trong and vigorous, being pretty much fatigued, emaciated and debilitated &s;ince then.</P>
<P>However, I re&s;olv'd with my&s;elf to keep her, if I could po&s;&s;ible, till I could find, whether there was Hopes to get any Thing at this I&s;land, &s;o as to recruit, and enable me to run down to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> for I hoped, if I could get a little Provi&s;ions, and per&s;uade two or three of the Blacks to go with me to help me at the Pump, which, now &s;he became &s;o leaky, was the principal Part of the Work, the Sails, with a &s;mall Matter of mending, would &s;erve to run down.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was Day, three of the Inhabitants of the I&s;land came down to the Sea-&s;ide, and haled the Sloop. I an&s;wer'd them. They ask'd me <HI>How I did?</HI> and welcom'd me to their I&s;land. I thank'd them. They ask'd, <HI>Whether they might come on Board?</HI> I told them, <HI>They might if they pleas'd, or knew how, for I had no Boat.</HI> They &s;aid, <HI>They had a Boat of their own:</HI> At which they jump'd into the Sea, and &s;wam off to me. As &s;oon as they were come on Board, they ask'd me, <HI>Whe|ther I was not an</HI> Engli&s;hman?

<P>Then, <HI>&s;aid I, Nicholau</HI> is got a&s;hore?

<P><HI>They ask'd me,</HI> If I had any Water on Board, for <HI>Nicholau Verd, they &s;aid,</HI> had told them, that I had had no Water when he came a&s;hore, nor for a long Time before.</P>

<P>I told them, <HI>I could not &s;wim;</HI> at which they much admir'd, that any Man &s;hould venture to go to Sea without knowing how to &s;wim.</P>

<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If there was any Water nigh Hand? <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> Yes, <HI>and &s;hew'd me whereabouts it was, and told me,</HI> If I would give them a large Calaba&s;h, they would &s;wim over the Bay, and fetch &s;ome; for the Rocks were &s;o &s;teep, that if a Man went a&s;hore on one Side of the Bay, he could not go round to the other Side, without &s;wimming.</P>
<P>I thank'd them, and told them, <HI>I had no Cala|ba&s;hes, but I had a &s;mall Cask;</HI> and bid the Boy hand up a half Anchor which was in the Hold.</P>
<P>When the Boy brought it up, they &s;aid <HI>it was too cumber&s;ome to &s;wim with, and they would there|fore go a&s;hore, and take their own Calaba&s;hes:</HI> Which are Gourds, that after all the Pulp and Seeds are taken out, are &s;et to dry, and &s;o become hard, and &s;erve them to carry their Water to their Hou&s;es, as al&s;o when they go a fi&s;hing or hunt|ing; for they never go abroad from their Huts without a Calaba&s;h of Water with them; and for their more ea&s;y Carriage of that, and their Pro|vi&s;ions, when they go a Journey, as al&s;o to bring home the Fi&s;h or Veni&s;on that they catch, they have every one of them a Goatskin, &s;tripped off without cutting the Skin open, &s;omething like a Soldier's Knap&s;ack; and the Hide of the Legs being &s;tripped down to the Hoofs, and the Hoofs cut off with the Skin, &s;erves to &s;ling them for their more ea&s;y Carriage, which they do by mak|ing fa&s;t the Feet of one Side together, and put|ting their Arms through, by which Means they hang over their Backs with little or no Trouble to them, as they are &s;o us'd to them.</P>

<P><HI>They were an&s;wer'd by the Blacks who &s;wam a&s;hore; at which they de&s;cended down the Rocks, and the others below waited for them till they came down, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, told them of their being on Board, &amp;c. after which, the&s;e new|come Blacks &s;wam off, being three in Number, and came on Board, and ask'd me,</HI> How I did, <HI>&amp;c. and told me,</HI> They had brought nothing from the Town with them, becau&s;e they did not know of my Nece&s;&s;ity; &s;aving two Pompions, which belong'd to tho&s;e Blacks who were gone to fetch me Water, who had de&s;ir'd them to bring them off with them: That they al&s;o had met with the Blacks who came a&s;hore la&s;t Night, and who, as they told them, were going to the Governor to get him to &s;end me down &s;ome Men to pump the Water out of the Ship, for that there was a great deal of Water came in thro' her Bottom, and if the Governor did not &s;end me down &s;ome Help, the Ship would &s;ink; and that they were &s;o tir'd with the Pump that they were almo&s;t dead; but had &s;aid nothing of my Want of Water and Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> Whether the Governor was a good Man or not?</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> He was an extraordinary good Man, and they believ'd he would have been down with me before now, but that he was very &s;ick of a Fever and Cough, which he had had a long Time, in&s;omuch, that he had not been out a hunting for

&s;everal Months; but they were &s;ure I &s;hould have &s;ome Help down that Day; <HI>and de&s;ir'd me</HI> to &s;hew them the Pump, that they might &s;ee what it was; <HI>which I did: And then they de&s;ir'd me</HI> to let them &s;ee how I work'd with it, that they might help me. <HI>Which I did very willingly, and they pump'd till it &s;uck'd, and then I made them leave off.</HI></P>
<P>In about two Hours, the Blacks who went for the Water return'd, and brought two Calaba&s;hes full with them, which I believe might be about &s;ix Quarts: I then went to work to make a Fire, and the Blacks were &s;o obliging, they would not let me make it, but made it them&s;elves. I made the Boy get up a little Rice, and &s;liced a Pompion into the Pot with it, of which we made &s;ome good Pap, and, as &s;oon as boil'd, we all eat heartily; after which, I gave them a &s;mall Dram of Rum apiece, for which they were very thankful.</P>
<P>I would have dre&s;s'd &s;ome of my dry'd Shark; but as &s;oon as they &s;aw it, they ask'd me, <HI>If that was not Fi&s;h call'd</HI> Sarde? I told them, <HI>I did not know.</HI></P>
<P>They ask'd me, <HI>Where I got it.</HI> I told them, <HI>I catch'd it at Sea;</HI> and when I told them after what Manner, they lifted up their Hands and Eyes, and much admir'd my Ingenuity in the Contrivance of catching it, and that any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould eat it; and were &s;ure it was that Kind of Fi&s;h which they call'd <HI>Sarde,</HI> asking me, <HI>If it would not &s;eize and devour an human Creature, if it &s;hould light on one in the Water?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> It would, and was a very voracious Fi&s;h. <HI>Then they &s;aid,</HI> It was the &s;ame; <HI>and di|rectly, without asking my Con&s;ent, to&s;s'd it all overboard, and &s;aid,</HI> They thought that no Man of any Nation would eat any Fi&s;h that fed upon human Fle&s;h; but e&s;pecially the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whom they took to be the nice&s;t and cleanlie&s;t People in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="159">
<HI>I told them,</HI> We did not u&s;e it commonly for Food, and that where Nece&s;&s;ity did not enforce us, we al|ways abhor'd &s;uch Food; but I catch'd it to keep me from &s;tarving, and yet, notwith&s;tanding I had it &s;o long on Board, and was reduc'd to &s;uch Want, I was &s;ure there was not three Pound Weight of it eaten.</P>
<P><HI>Some &s;aid,</HI> It was better to eat any Thing than &s;tarve; <HI>others,</HI> That they would &s;ooner &s;tarve than eat any Thing that lived upon human Kind.</P>
<P><HI>After we had eaten, and talk'd a while in this Manner, they began to talk among them&s;elves about going to their Town, and told me,</HI> They wonder'd that the Governor had not &s;ent &s;ome Men down to me, and believ'd that they who went from me to Town, had not &s;poke with the Governor, or perhaps they might be weary, or not find the Way to it; but they would go a&s;hore, and make the be&s;t of their Way to Town, and &s;peak to the Governor that Night, to &s;end me &s;ome Help betimes in the Morning, and likewi&s;e to order me &s;ome Veni&s;on and other Pro|vi&s;ions; and did not know but &s;ome of them&s;elves might come on the Morrow, if they were not too much tir'd; for, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> it was an ugly difficult Way to Town, as well as long and dangerous, the Rocks being very apt to fall; but &s;ome of them would &s;tay to help me to do what I wanted to be done, that was in their Power to do, and al&s;o go and catch me &s;ome fre&s;h Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and de&s;ir'd them</HI> to give my Ser|vice to the Governor, and de&s;ire him to &s;end me ten or a Dozen Men down, to hale my Ve&s;&s;el further in|to the Bay, to make her fa&s;t, and I would pay to his Satisfaction with any Thing I had on Board the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, <HI>I need not fear having twenty, or more Men down on the Morrow;</HI> and &s;o went a|&s;hore all together, two of them having concluded
<PB N="154" REF="160">
to &s;tay, but went a&s;hore with the re&s;t to catch &s;ome Fi&s;h for my Supper. They al&s;o pump'd the Ve&s;&s;el dry before they went a&s;hore, as they had done all the Time that they were on Board.</P>
<P>Now I began to be a little up in my Spirits, &s;eeing the People were &s;o affable, and was in Hopes that the Danger of peri&s;hing by Famine was over. About duski&s;h, the two Men who went a fi&s;hng return'd on Board, and brought a good hand&s;ome Di&s;h of Fi&s;h, and a Calaba&s;h of Water with them, which we dre&s;s'd, with &s;ome Pompion; and after we had taken the Fi&s;h up out of the Pot, at their De&s;ire, I made the Boy bring up a little Flower, and with it and the Fi&s;h-Broth we made &s;ome Pap, which by the Blacks was accounted a mo&s;t favoury Di&s;h, as al&s;o it was to me and the Boy, not having eat any hot or dre&s;s'd Victuals a long Time before.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They would not have me trouble my&s;elf with the Pump, but the Boy and I might go to Sleep, and take a whole Night's Re&s;t, which they did believe, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> I very much &s;tood in need of.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and &s;aid,</HI> I would accept of their kind Offer; but de&s;ir'd, if I &s;hould chance to fall a&s;leep, and it &s;hould blow, or fall Calm, or the Wind &s;hould &s;hift, that they would not fail to call me; for, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if it &s;hould fall calm, the Ve&s;&s;el, by the turning of the Tide, might take a Turn with the Cable round the Anchor, and when the Anchor was foul with the Cable, it would not hold, but let the Ve&s;&s;el drive either on the Rocks, or el&s;e out to Sea, according as the Wind blew.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They would be &s;ure to call me if Oc|ca&s;ion requir'd, or any Alteration happen'd different from what it was when I lay down.</P>
<P>So I &s;moak'd a Pipe of Tobacco which they had brought with them, and gave to each of them a
<PB N="155" REF="161">
&s;hort Junk of Pipe, for I had no other left by the Pirates, and con&s;idering I could not employ or make U&s;e of my Rum better, than to entertain &s;uch Gue&s;ts as they were with it, I gave each of them a &s;mall Dram apiece, and told them, <HI>I had but very little of it now; but had a great deal of it when the Pirates took me, who had robb'd me of it all, except a little that lay in the Bottom of a Cask, which I believ'd they knew nothing of, or they had not left me that; but &s;ince I &s;aw they were &s;o kind to me, I could wi&s;h I had &s;omething better to give them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They thank'd me, and told me,</HI> They would ra|ther have me keep it for my&s;elf, becau&s;e, perhaps, I being u&s;ed to drink it, might not &s;o well be able to live without it; but as for their Parts they could do very well without it, tho' it was the be&s;t Liquor that ever they had ta&s;ted; having often heard of it, and &s;everal of their I&s;landers had drank pretty much of it, e&s;pecially when the Pirates u&s;ed to come thi|ther; but for their Parts they never before ta&s;ted any <HI>Aqua ardenta, (which is the general Name they give to all hot Spirits, not knowing the Difference, or how to di&s;tingui&s;h Rum from Brandy, &amp;c.)</HI> But they would not, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> have me own that I had any on Board, for there were &s;ome of the Inha|bitants who knew what <HI>Aqua ardenta</HI> was; and if once they came to know I had it, they would drink it all away from me, and then I &s;hould be de&s;titute of &s;omething to comfort me, and perhaps die for want of it; for they had heard that their Food was &s;o different and ordinary to what ours was, that an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> could not live upon it. Be&s;ides, their People not being u&s;ed to any &s;uch, could not have any want of it, Water being their only Drink, and therefore more natural to them. They al&s;o had heard it related, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> That a certain Pirate call'd <HI>Maringwin,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> which Country they did
<PB N="156" REF="162">
not know but might be in <HI>England,</HI> having landed on this I&s;land, <HI>(which, as my unlucky Pilot</HI> Ni|cholau Verd <HI>told me, was about 20 Years before, and the&s;e two Blacks, by their Countenance, I judg'd to be about 24 Years of Age)</HI> had abun|dance of that &s;trong Water on Board, and was very free of it among the black People of this I&s;land, who drank plentifully of it, and not being us'd to it, were mad for &s;ome Time after, and &s;ome of them fell &s;ick, and dy'd of mad Fevers: Notwith&s;tanding which, many that were now on this I&s;land, were almo&s;t every Day wi&s;hing, that a Pirate, or any other Ship, would come and take them with them to &s;ome Country, where they might have enough of that hot Liquor to drink; and that they had often declar'd, they would certainly go with them.</P>
<P>Hearing this, made me in Hopes, that if I could recruit my&s;elf with a &s;mall Matter of Pro|vi&s;ions and Water, it would be an ea&s;y Mat|ter, if what they &s;aid but now was true, to get three or four of them to go with me, to help to carry the Sloop down to <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If there was good Store of Cotton on the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> There was Cotton enough, but nothing nigh &s;o much as had been, becau&s;e the Sea&s;ons had not been &s;o kindly, for want of Rain, as they us'd to be, nor their I&s;land &s;o plenty as formerly; but &s;till, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> they did not want, there being more by one half than they gather'd and made u&s;e of.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If they did not make Cotton Cloths to &s;ell.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> There was few or none on the I&s;land but what had Cotton Cloths, and &s;ome had a great many; but no Ships coming to buy them, they gene|rally made no more than they had Occa&s;ion for, for their own U&s;e: But that, however, &s;ome Women had &s;ix or eight Cloths; of which Number, <HI>&s;ays one</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="163">
<HI>of them,</HI> my Mother is one; but they wore them &s;o &s;eldom, that a Cloth would la&s;t &s;ome Years.</P>

<P>I told them, <HI>I would buy it;</HI> for I had &s;ome Gla&s;s Beads, and &s;ome old Cloths, &amp;c. than which you cannot have a more acceptable Com|modity to traffick with tho&s;e People.</P>
<P><HI>It growing late, (I believe near or about the Hour of ten) they &s;aid,</HI> They would have me go lie down and &s;leep, and they would look out for me, and call whenever there was Occa&s;ion, and would keep the Sloop always pumping dry.</P>
<P>Being pretty &s;leepy, and much fatigu'd by &s;it|ting up all the Night before, I was willing to ac|cept their Kindne&s;s, and gave them a half-Hour Gla&s;s, and &s;hew'd them, that in a certain Space of Time, all the Sand would run out of the upper Gla&s;s into the lower, and then, by turning the End which had the Sand in it, uppermo&s;t, in the &s;ame Space the Sand would run again into the other End; and &s;o by turning the Gla&s;s as &s;oon as the upper End was empty, they might know how the Time pa&s;s'd; and that it would be enough to pump the Ve&s;&s;el every Time they turn'd the Gla&s;s, and when they had &s;uck'd her, to let the Pump &s;tand till the upper End of the Gla&s;s was empty; and then to turn the Gla&s;s and pump again.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They would; <HI>and ask'd,</HI> How many Times the Gla&s;s mu&s;t run out, and be turn'd again, to make that Space of Time which I call'd an Hour? <HI>Having told them</HI> twice, <HI>they ask'd me,</HI> Whether the Gla&s;s would run the Sand in that Time if every one went to Sleep, as exactly as if it was watch'd?</P>

&s;eem'd to be a great many: But they &s;aid it was only the &s;ounding of the Rocks, which made me think &s;o; but they knew there were but two Men.</P>
<P>The Reader will perhaps wonder how I came to be &s;o perfect in their Language &s;o &s;oon, it being the fir&s;t Time I came among them: But I mu&s;t acquaint him, That the Ground or Original of their Language is the &s;ame with that of their Stock, which was, as I hinted before, from the <HI>Mandingo Negro's;</HI> from which they retain a Dialoct, as well as a great many of the primitive Words of that large Nation, and far extended Language; and the re&s;t of it is made up of a corrupted <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and &s;ome other Words, which &s;eem to be coined or invented &s;ince their Settlement here, and incorporated by U&s;e with their hodge-podge Language.</P>
<P>Now I had a tolerable Smatch of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> Language, which is the mo&s;t &s;ignificant Part of their Dialect: Be&s;ides, they have &s;o many Motions (as indeed mo&s;t of the Inhabi|tants of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> I&s;lands have, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of this, and the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip)</HI> that thereby, and by the Accent, which gives Life and Force to their Meaning, of which I had &s;ome Notion before, that they &s;erv'd very much to explain what they &s;aid. I al&s;o under&s;tood &s;ome|thing of the general barbarous Language of the Windward I&s;lands, which comes &s;o nigh to the Language of the Leeward I&s;lands, as in a great Mea&s;ure enabled me to apprehend the Purport of what they &s;aid in the general, and to make us under&s;tand one another; but yet &s;o ob&s;curely and confu&s;edly, and with &s;o much Difficulty, as would have render'd an Interpreter nece&s;&s;ary, could &s;uch a one have been had; tho' perhaps he could not expre&s;s him&s;elf with the Empha&s;is or

Force that I could, however, he might be a better Ma&s;ter of the Tongue. But to return: The Blacks waited a while to &s;ee if they would come down; but &s;eeing they did not, they &s;aid they would go a&s;hore and meet them, and &s;end them on Board, and they them&s;elves would go a fi&s;h|ing, and bring &s;ome on Board for Dinner: So away they &s;wam on Shore.</P>
<P>Some Time after, two Men came down, and &s;wam on Board, being the &s;ame who had whoop'd in the Morning, and brought with them a Pom|pion; and told me, that the other two, who had been on Board all Night, were gone a Fi&s;hing, and would be back about Noon, and had given them a great Charge to mind the Pump; and de&s;ir'd me to &s;hew them what they mu&s;t do.</P>
<P>This I very readily did, and they as readily wrought as they were taught; and about twelve or one o'Clock, the other two return'd with a hand&s;ome Di&s;h of Fi&s;h, which we dre&s;s'd with &s;ome Pompion, and, as before, made &s;ome Pap with the Fi&s;h-Broth, and made a hearty Meal thereon; but my Me&s;s-mates de&s;ir'd me not to u&s;e my Flower, but keep it for my&s;elf, and Boy; which they all took to be my Son, and &s;till be|lieve to be &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> I &s;hould not get any &s;uch Food here, as my Flower was; and that if the Prie&s;t heard that I had any, he would, they believ'd, ex|pect me to give him &s;ome.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That I had but a very little; but the Prie&s;t, Governor, or any Body el&s;e on the I&s;land, was very welcome to that, or any Thing el&s;e that I had on Board.</P>
<P>I waited and expected to have &s;ome Help down, but none came; and in the Afternoon it began to blow, and look'd dark, cloudy, and heavy to Windward, over the Land, which is a certain

Sign of a Gale of Wind, &s;o that I began to fear, if it &s;hould blow hard, and my Ground-Tackle give Way, I &s;hould drive out to Sea, and then &s;hould be in a wor&s;e Condition than ever I had been yet: I propos'd therefore to them, to &s;wim with the End of a &s;mall Rope a&s;hore, and by that to hale a Cable-end, and make it fa&s;t to the Rocks; which they did, but &s;o &s;lightly, that it &s;lipt; and all the Arguments that I could u&s;e to per&s;uade them, could not prevail with them to try once more, and to carry a Fa&s;t a&s;hore: Which made me very di&s;con&s;olate, the Wind in|crea&s;ing &s;till: They &s;eeing me di&s;&s;atisfy'd, and asking the Rea&s;on, I told them, <HI>That I could ex|pect nothing but to peri&s;h, if I and the Boy &s;hould drive again out to Sea;</HI> and told them, <HI>how &s;afely that might be prevented, if I had a Cable well made fa&s;t a&s;hore.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They had try'd already, and the E|vening now grew cold; be&s;ides, they were &s;o &s;pent and tired with what they had done, that they could not pretend to get it a&s;hore again; be&s;ides, they knew that they could never make it well fa&s;t; but they were &s;ure there were &s;ome Men would come down the next Day from the Town without fail, that could make fa&s;t my Cable to the Rocks, or do any Thing el&s;e that I had occa&s;ion to have done.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did not know what Sort of Ground we had in the Bottom, and did not know but it might be rocky, and would cut my Cable; which, if it did, I could expect nothing but to drive to Sea, and peri&s;h, having no Way to e&s;cape to the Land, and no Boat, and neither the Boy nor I being able to &s;wim one Stroke.</P>
<P><HI>They bid me not be di&s;hearten'd,</HI> For they would manage that well enough; And, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> we two that tarry'd with you on Board la&s;t Night, will go up to Town to Night; and will go to the Governor

as &s;oon as we come up, and &s;peak to him to order Men down to help you, and will come down with them our&s;elves; and the other two Men who came down to Day, will &s;tay on Board with you, to pump, or do any Thing you de&s;ire them, that they can, till we come back again; and if the Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould drive away, you need not fear but what we would &s;afely and &s;ecurely get you a&s;hore, and the Boy al&s;o; <HI>and pointing to the Cro&s;s-jeck Yard which lay upon Deck, they &s;aid,</HI> With that they could carry me a hundred Times farther than from thence to the Shore, with Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I thank'd them; and de&s;ir'd them to take a little Flower up with them for the Prie&s;t and Go|vernor, and with it to give my Service to them, and de&s;ire them to &s;end &s;ome People down to me, and to be &s;ure to get <HI>Nicholau Verd</HI> to come with them, becau&s;e he would be more &s;erviceable than they, by rea&s;on he could make fa&s;t a Rope, or do any Thing el&s;e much more handy than any of them could.</P>
<P>They told me, It was better to let the Flower alone; becau&s;e they had a long, as well as a dangerous Way to climb up the Rocks, and that it was now &s;o late, that were it not that my Ne|ce&s;&s;ity requir'd it, they &s;hould not care to climb up tho&s;e &s;teep, as well as rotten Rocks; but they would tell both the Prie&s;t and Governor of it, with the Rea&s;ons of their not bringing it up with them, and de&s;ire them to &s;end &s;ome Body down for it them&s;elves: So away they went a&s;hore.</P>
<P>It continu'd to blow at Night, as it had done in the Afternoon; but towards Day it was a little moderate, and the Sun ro&s;e pretty clear, only, be|fore his Ri&s;ing, it &s;hewed very hazy and fiery to the North-Ea&s;t and Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t Board, which the two Blacks that were on Board with
<PB N="167" REF="173">
me, &s;aid, was a great and &s;ure Sign of very hard Gales of Wind, as the Day increas'd, and the Sun ro&s;e up higher; but more e&s;pecially after the Sun began to fall. All which came to pa&s;s very exactly, though I could &s;ee nothing that portend|ed any Thing of a hard Gale.</P>
<P>After the Sun had mounted about 30 Degrees of Altitude, it began to blow very hard, and the Flaws came down the Rocks with an incredi|ble Force, even beyond what I could believe to have been in the Wind, if I had not felt it: Sometimes they would come right off the high rocky Land, and &s;ometimes a counter Flaw would blow right counter to that on the Land, and rai&s;e up the Water beyond what I ever &s;aw a Whale or Grampus do, to an almo&s;t incredi|ble Degree; and if they took the Sloop at any Time on the Bow, Quarter, or Broad&s;ide, &s;he would heel to it, more than any Body would believe that had not &s;een it. Indeed they did not hold long, &s;ome a Minute, or half a Minute, &s;ome came with a &s;udden Puff, and would be gone again before &s;he brought her Cable taut.</P>
<P>I could not tell what to do; but often wi&s;hed that the Boy and I were &s;afe a&s;hore, and fre|quently looked out, to &s;ee if I could perceive any of the Blacks coming down the Rocks to us; but all in vain.</P>
<P><HI>About two in the Afternoon it cea&s;ed a little, but &s;till continued to blow very hard, though not in &s;uch &s;trong Flaws as it did, and I began to hope the Heart of the Gale was broke; and about three in the Afternoon, the two Blacks who went up the Evening before, came down, and &s;wam off on Board, and was glad to &s;ee that we were not drove out to Sea.</HI> They were afraid, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> they &s;hould have been blown off the
<PB N="168" REF="174">
Rocks, as they were a coming down; <HI>and told me.</HI> They had been with the Prie&s;t and the Governor, who had told them, they had both of them &s;poke to the People, and had ordered &s;o many to come down to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, that they thought I had had Help be|fore them: That thereupon they went to &s;peak to the People; but found them all unwilling to come down, nor did they care to give them any Rea&s;on wherefore: That they went al&s;o to find <HI>Nicholau Verd,</HI> to get him to come with them, as I had de|&s;ir'd them, but they could not find him: That at la&s;t one told them the Rea&s;on that none of them would venture to come down; which was, that <HI>Nicholau</HI> was afraid to come on Board, for fear I &s;hould carry him to Sea again, and had prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd the re&s;t with the like Fear.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They did all that they could to per|&s;uade them that their Fears were groundle&s;s, but all in vain; wherefore, &s;eeing they could not prevail with any of them, they came down them&s;elves to let me know it, and to do me any Service they could.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and told them,</HI> The only and be&s;t Service they could do me, was to get the Rope a&s;hore, as they did the Day before, and make it well fa&s;t; and then, if the Cable at the Anchor gave Way, I could always hale or heave the Sloop to the Rock, and by that Means the Boy and I &s;hould have a fair Chance to &s;ave our Lives.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> If that was all, they would carry me and the Boy a&s;hore now, and they would &s;tay in the Sloop.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and told them,</HI> I would rather &s;tay on Board, while I had any Hopes of &s;aving her; and wi&s;h'd they would carry a Rope a&s;hore, which would be a Means to prevent the Anchor-Cable being cut with the Rocks, which otherways I could expect no le&s;s, by her ranging and &s;weeping
<PB N="169" REF="175">
the Ground &s;o with the Cable, with the uncer|tain and variable Flaws.</P>
<P>They &s;aid they would; &s;o I bid them carry the &s;mall Rope a&s;hore, and make it fa&s;t to the Rock, and then we would hale the Sloop to the Rock, and I would go a&s;hore my&s;elf and make fa&s;t the Cable; which accordingly they agreed to; &s;o I unreev'd the Topping Lift, the Main Haliards, and Jibb Haliards, and bent them, and three of the Blacks jump'd into the Sea, one of them taking the End of the Rope, the other two taking the Bite at a Di&s;tance, the one from the other, as I directed them, and got the End a&s;hore, and made it fa&s;t; and then they came on Board again, and I unbent the main Sheet, and unreev'd it, which was a new Rope, that I had bought at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and bent it to the Cable that was at the Anchor, to lengthen it, to veer the Sloop to the Rock; which we did, by veer|ing the Cable, and heaving in the Shore-fa&s;t, till we hove the Sloop to the Rock Side, which was as &s;teep up and down as a Key, and about two Fathom Water at the Rock Side.</P>
<P>I then jumped a&s;hore, and made fa&s;t an End of a Cable to the Rock, and ca&s;ting off the Rope from the Shore, I veered off by the Cable made fa&s;t a&s;hore, and hove in upon the Anchor-Cable, 'till I got her off in her Birth again; but &s;till being dubious of the Anchor Cable &s;weeping and ranging the Ground, I was willing to &s;ee whether it was rubbed, chafed, or &s;tranded any where, and bending the main Sheet to the Shore-Cable, to lengthen that, I hove a Peek on the Anchor, and found it rubbed in &s;everal Places, and in one Place, better than a whole Strand cut through.</P>
<P>My De&s;ign was, as the Wind then blew off Shore, and not now extraordinary hard, though &s;till a taut Gale, and the Sloop riding altogether
<PB N="170" REF="176">
by the Shore-fa&s;t, to have hove the Anchor up, and to cut the Cable off where it was &s;tranded, and bend it again to the Anchor, and let it go under Foot, and then veer upon the Anchor-Cable, and heave in upon the other Cable that was fa&s;t a&s;hore, and &s;o ride moored: But all of a &s;udden, the Blacks laid down their Hand-Spikes, and told me, I was going to carry them away to Sea, and looked very angry: I told them, no, and &s;hewed them the Cable where it was cut, and did all that I could to per&s;uade them out of their Opinion, and urged my Nece&s;&s;ity for what I was going to do, and that the Sloop could not be &s;aved without doing it; and al&s;o, that I dared not do it, until I had got a Cable fa&s;t on the Shore.</P>
<P>They told me, I had made it fa&s;t, &s;o that it would loo&s;e when&s;oever I had a Mind it &s;hould, and that it was only to amu&s;e them, the better to decoy them away: That if I had &s;erved &s;ome of them that was upon the I&s;land, as I intended to &s;erve them, they would kill me directly; but they would not do me any harm, but would run no more Hazard, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, to be carried away to any Place, where they &s;hould never &s;ee their Friends or Home any more.</P>
<P>I endeavoured all I could to pacify them, not knowing what Danger &s;uch a Notion might bring me into; and, perhaps, fix an Odium on me from tho&s;e, who, in all Likelihood, were to be my Neighbours during a long Time; at lea&s;t, longer than I de&s;ired, if not for all my Life; and at la&s;t per&s;uaded them to lend me a Hand to hale in again the Shore-fa&s;t, and moor her again be|tween that and the Anchor, which they did, and then began to talk to one another about going a&s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="177">
I did all I could to per&s;uade them to &s;tay on Board, not &s;o much for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as for fear they &s;hould &s;pread a Notion, that I was going to carry them away from the I&s;land; for I had a good Cable End a&s;hore, and well made fa&s;t, &s;o that the Boy and I could, at any Time, heave her in to the Rock Side, when the Anchor-Cable gave way, and, without any Danger, in a man|ner, &s;tep a&s;hore.</P>
<P>I much importuned them to tarry with me this Night, and not to go a&s;hore 'till the Morning.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> I might endeavour to per&s;uade them to this, in order to have the better Opportunity to carry them to Sea in the Night.</P>
<P><HI>I repre&s;ented</HI> how unprovided I was, both for Sails, Provi&s;ions, and Water, which was the only Rea&s;on that brought me there: That they all knew very well, I had not recruited in the lea&s;t with any thing &s;ince I came there: Be&s;ides, they were Four &s;trong, lu&s;ty Men, and I but one, and weak, and half fami&s;hed; and that the Boy could be reckoned as no-body.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> That I had a <HI>Spring Guarda</HI> (i. e. <HI>a Musket)</HI> and with it, could kill Twenty or Thirty of them, and therefore they were &s;ure, if they re&s;i&s;ted, to be killed; but would rather peri&s;h here, than be compelled by Force to go with me; and, that that was the Rea&s;on which made <HI>Nicholau Verd</HI> jump over-board from me into the Sea, and make his E&s;cape to them, becau&s;e he knew, that as long as I had the <HI>Spring Guarda,</HI> I could make him, and a Hundred more, if they &s;hould oppo&s;e me, die, or &s;ub|mit to what I required of them.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> If that was what they were afraid of, I would bring it up, and put it into their Hands, for their Satisfaction and Security, and thereby give them an Occa&s;ion to &s;ee, that I was not at all afraid to venture my Life into their Power, and that volun|tarily,
<PB N="172" REF="178">
without any Compul&s;ion, more than the De&s;ire to &s;atisfy them.</P>
<P>Hereupon, I went down into the Cabbin and brought it up, and it being loaden, I fired it off, which a little &s;urprized them; but I told them, it was only to clear it, &s;o that it &s;hould not harm them.</P>
<P>They took it, and &s;eemed to be better &s;atisfied, and concluded, all Four of them, to &s;tay on Board all Night, which they did; during which, it con|tinued to blow a taut Gale, with hard Squalls off the Land, but nothing &s;o hard as tho&s;e which we had the preceding Day.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the Night as well as we could, and they would have had me gone to &s;leep; but I could not all the Night, though, to plea&s;e them, I went and lay down, but had too many Thoughts to let me re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Morning it looked as it did the Day be|fore, and, I thought, more fiery and red; and the Blacks told me, It would blow very hard as &s;oon as the Sun was ri&s;en up above the Mountains, and, they believed, harder than it did the Day before.</P>
<P>I told them, That I hoped their Fears which they had of me the Evening before, were over, and that therefore, they would a&s;&s;i&s;t me to weigh the Anchor, to cut the Cable where I &s;hewed them, the Day before, it was &s;tranded, in order to &s;ecure the Sloop.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, They would not meddle with it yet, 'till &s;ome more Men came down, which they did expect.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I believed no-body would come down, 'till &s;ome of them went up to Town.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, Yes there would, for they were &s;ure &s;ome of them would come down on the Rocks to &s;ee whether the Sloop was gone or no, and as
<PB N="173" REF="179">
&s;oon as they &s;aw any of them, they would call to them, and they were &s;ure they would venture to come on Board, when they had &s;poke to them; &s;o I was forced to be ea&s;y, and wait their Lei|&s;ure.</P>
<P>About Nine or Ten o'Clock, it began again to blow much harder, if it was po&s;&s;ible, than it did the Day before, and we were all as wet, as if we had been thrown into the Sea, with the Spray, or what el&s;e you plea&s;e to call it, which the Sea hove up into the Air like a Water-Spout; in&s;o|much, that &s;ometimes we could not &s;ee the Land, though it was &s;o nigh and &s;o high.</P>
<P>We &s;aw &s;everal People on the Rocks, but it blew &s;o hard, that they could not hear us, and &s;ometimes could not &s;ee us, when the Spray was whirled up by the fierce Gu&s;ts encountering one another.</P>
<P>About Twelve or one o' Clock in the Day, which was the 29th of <HI>November,</HI> 1722, the Anchor-Cable parted with a Counter-flaw on the Land, and drove us on a Point of broken Rocks, which lay in the Bay. We did all we could to heave in upon the Cable that was fa&s;t on the South-Ea&s;t Point of the Bay, to clear the Sloop of that Point of broken Rocks, over which the Sea broke very much; but all in vain, for the fierce Gu&s;t blowing right on, carried us upon them, maugre all the Art and Diligence we could u&s;e to the contrary, and &s;ticking there, the Sea &s;truck &s;o forcibly, that it &s;oon made Way for the Water to come in through her Bottom, and, in a very &s;hort Time, the Water was almo&s;t as high within, as without, and the Sea being rai&s;ed like a Water-Spout, with the Violence of the Winds encountering one another, &s;omething like the Whirlwinds rai&s;ing the light Sands on the De|&s;arts of <HI>Africa,</HI> in&s;omuch, that we could not &s;ee
<PB N="174" REF="180">
the high Lands over us, only the Shore under|neath, and the Violence of the Sea and Weather, &s;truck &s;o upon the Sloop, that I expected, at every Stroke, the Ma&s;t would have jumped out, and could hardly tell which way to &s;tand, to be clear of the Fall of it.</P>
<P>This frightful Situation made all the Blacks get a&s;hore, and leave the Boy and I alone; but as the Sloop did not heave nor &s;trike &s;o much when the Bottom was broke and opened, &s;o that the Sea had a free Pa&s;&s;age in and out, as it did before, and the Boy crying and making a pitiful Lamen|tation, and the Violence of the Flaw of Wind being a little abated, Two of them came off, their Fright being a little over, and one of them took the Boy and carried him a&s;hore: The other asked me, if I would go, which I con&s;enting to, he advi&s;ed me to tarry 'till he went a&s;hore and got &s;ome more of them to help him, becau&s;e, the &s;unken Rocks were &s;o very &s;harp, and, in &s;ome Places, the Water &s;o &s;hallow, that one of the Blacks was very much cut by them, as he was getting a&s;hore; but if I had any Cloaths to &s;end a&s;hore, he &s;aid, he would carry them with him now, and then would come with &s;ome of his Con|&s;orts to help me off.</P>
<P>Upon this, I gave him what Things I could find &s;wimming about the Cabbin, and he went down and fi&s;hed all the old Cloaths and Rags he could find, and went a&s;hore with them, and af|terwards came off with Two more, to carry me likewi&s;e thither.</P>
<P>I would have taken the Cro&s;s-Jeck-Yard, which lay la&s;hed to the Side upon Deck, to have &s;wam upon, and they to guide it; but they &s;aid, That would be the Way to lo&s;e my Life and theirs too, becau&s;e of the &s;hallow Water over the &s;unken Rocks; adding, That if the Sea-Breaks &s;hould
<PB N="175" REF="181">
drive us again&s;t another Rock, it would, pro|bably, beat them all to Pieces, and wa&s;h me off the Yard; but when they had only me to take care of, they &s;hould do much better.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed &s;omething to help buoy me up, for fear I &s;hould be too heavy for them, as I could not &s;wim at all; but they &s;aid, They did not doubt in the lea&s;t, to convey me &s;afe, with the Help of St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> who, they were &s;ure, would a&s;&s;i&s;t them, becau&s;e they had &s;aid a <HI>Padre nos</HI> be|fore they came off.</P>
<P><HI>Upon my telling them, I tru&s;ted in God and Chri&s;t to help me, They &s;aid,</HI> So did they; but as they had de&s;ired St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> it was the &s;ame as if they had asked God, or Chri&s;t, he being God's Friend, who would not therefore deny him any thing; and they always cho&s;e to ask him, or any of the Saints, becau&s;e, as they were formerly Men, they had a thorough Sen&s;e of their Wants, and were al|ways compa&s;&s;ionate, and ready to help them.</P>

About Midway, they &s;wam with me over a &s;hallow Rock, which I touched with my Feet, and ju&s;t as we got over it, a Sea came up with us, and breaking upon us, one of the Blacks dived down with me under Water, and then let me go, which frightened me pretty much; but the other held me fa&s;t, and brought me up again, and the Third Black, who &s;wam clo&s;e after us, as &s;oon as he &s;aw that I was quitted by one of them, darted up along-&s;ide of me like a Fi&s;h, and &s;up|plied the Place of him who had for&s;ook me, and, through the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a merciful God, we got &s;afe to Shore.</P>
<P>He that had &s;lipped me in the Water, &s;eeing the other had taken hold of me, &s;wam back again to the Sloop, to &s;ee if there was any Thing to be got, worth &s;aving for me; and took down the Looking-Gla&s;s, which was fix'd up in the After-part of the Cabbin, and found three Stockings, and a Pair of old Shoes; all which he brought a&s;hore with him; and before he had well reach'd it, the Stern, with the After-part of the Deck, parted, and drove away; and pre&s;ently after came two terrible Gu&s;ts off the high Lands, tum|bling down through Gullies in the Rocks, as though they would over-turn the Rocks and Moun|tains, and encountering one another on the Sur|face of the Sea, rais'd the Water to a great Height; and the Counter-Gu&s;t overcoming the other, brought down upon us &s;uch a heavy Shower, like a Deluge, that we could not tell where to get out of the Way of it, and, indeed, I began to fear we &s;hould peri&s;h, notwith&s;tanding we were got &s;afe to the Land; for where we were come a&s;hore, there was no Pa&s;&s;age for me to get up, hardly high enough to keep clear of the Wa|ter, when it was full Sea.</P>

the Squall being over, and the Air cleared a little (after the Water rai&s;ed up was fallen) the Figure of the Sloop was gone, her Stern, and a Piece of the Deck, driving away; the Off-&s;ide of her was broke from the Bottom, and the Ma&s;t was down, which, however, the Rigging kept fa&s;t to the Inner-&s;ide, which, as yet, was not parted from the Bottom.</P>
<P>The Natives who were on the Top of the Rocks, &s;aw the Sloop come on the Ledge of the Rocks, and likewi&s;e beheld us take to the Water, but could not &s;ee whether we got a&s;hore or not; whereupon they made all the Ha&s;te down that they could, to &s;ee what was become of us; and about Two Hours, or more, after we got a&s;hore, came to us to the Number of Five or Six, and were very glad we were all got &s;afe to the Shore, and &s;eemed to take Abundance of Notice of the Boy, &s;eeing him &s;o young and little, and pitied him very much.</P>
<P>The Blacks who had been with me in the Sloop, asked the others, Why they had not brought them down &s;omething to eat?</P>
<P>They told them, That as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Sea wa&s;h over the Sloop, and us take to the Water, they made the be&s;t of their Way down to a&s;&s;i&s;t, if there was Occa&s;ion, to get the Captain of the Sloop, and his Child, a&s;hore, becau&s;e they knew that white People were not &s;o hardy, nor u&s;ed to the Water like the Blacks; and that there were a great many People coming (that could not clamber down the Rocks &s;o well as they) who, they believed, had &s;omething with them to eat.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in about Half an Hour, came another Parcel of them down, and cur&s;ed the Way, &s;aying, They would not have ventured to come down, if they had known it had been &s;o bad; and &s;oon after, came another Parcel, who brought
<PB N="178" REF="185">
with them &s;ome Pompions, and &s;ome Milk in a Calaba&s;h, and asked, Whether we could not make a Fire? they &s;aid, They had nothing to &s;trike a Fire with, neither had they any Fewel to make it with; one &s;aid, He had Steel, Tinder, and Cot|ton, and &s;ome of the others asked me, If the Wood of the Wreck would not burn? I told them yes, very well; at which, an elderly Man bid &s;ome of the young Men &s;wim off, and bring &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t and lighte&s;t Pieces of Boards which were &s;wimming about in the Water, which they did, the Weather being &s;omething abated, and the Sun beginning to &s;hine; notwith&s;tanding which, I &s;hook with Cold, as al&s;o did my wet Companions.</P>
<P>But when the Wood was brought a&s;hore, we had no convenient Place to kindle a Fire there, the Beach being wet; and though the Water, by this Time, was low, yet, &s;ome of them &s;aid, when the Sea filled again, it would overflow all the Beach up to the Rocks; others &s;aid not: However they hunted about, and at la&s;t found a Place in the Rock, that was about Sixteen or Eighteen Foot above the Flowing of the Sea, and about Seven or Eight Foot broad, with the Rock over-hanging: There they concluded to make the Fire, and &s;aid, That we that were cold and wet, would have Room enough to &s;it down and warm our&s;elves, and for the re&s;t, they might do well enough without; and asked, Whe|ther we could not boil &s;ome Pompion, to have &s;omething hot to warm us within?</P>
<P>I told them, there were Two Pots in the Sloop, but I believed they could not be got now the Sloop was broke, though they were left on the Deck, which was whole, and fa&s;tened to that Part of the Sloop that &s;tuck on the Rock; but
<PB N="179" REF="186">
that it was probable the Sea had wa&s;hed them off, and that they were &s;unk to the Bottom.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, That &s;ignified nothing; and that as &s;oon as it was moderate Weather, which, they hoped, would be towards the Evening, &s;ome of the young Men &s;hould &s;wim off and get them, if the Sea had not carried them too far, or drove them under the Hollow of the Rocks, be|yond their Di&s;covery. Nor did they fear, they &s;aid, getting them, or any thing el&s;e that would &s;ink, and not drive away too far.</P>
<P>They then made me and the Boy drink &s;ome of the Milk they had brought in the Calaba&s;h; and &s;eeing my Feather-bed &s;wimming about on the Sea, Two of them &s;wam off, and &s;aved it, and laid it upon the Rock to dry.</P>
<P>After this, &s;ome of the Blacks went in que&s;t of Wood to make a Fire with, and &s;ome Gra&s;s, &amp;c. to &s;leep on; while others &s;taid with us below all Night, which we pa&s;&s;ed as well as we could, it proving moderate Weather, clear, and Starlight.</P>
<P>The next Day al&s;o proved fine Weather, and the Sun ri&s;ing clear and plea&s;ant, and it growing warm, &s;ome of my Companions &s;wam off to &s;eek for what they could find, the Bottom of the Wreck &s;till lying on the Ledge of Rocks, and the Ma&s;t, and &s;ome of the Rigging being entangled there.</P>
<P>They brought &s;ome &s;mall Pieces of &s;mall Ropes a&s;hore, and all the Bits and Pieces of Boards on which they found any Paint, e&s;teeming them the riche&s;t Stuff of all, and told me, there were the Sails fa&s;t to the Ma&s;t, and asked me, Whether they &s;hould &s;ave them? I told them, If they could, I &s;hould be very glad, and bid them &s;ave that, or any thing el&s;e that could be &s;aved; at which they &s;wam off again, a Dozen or Fourteen of them, and di&s;entangled the Ma&s;t, Sails, and
<PB N="180" REF="187">
Ropes, from the Wreck, ca&s;ting off, or cutting with their Knives, where it was fa&s;t, and brought the Ma&s;t, Boom, and Bolt&s;prit, all entangled and fa&s;t together, to the Shore, and we haled them as far on as we could; and what Ropes we could get, we laid up as &s;ecure as po&s;&s;ible in the Clefts and Hollows of the Rocks. The Main-Sail was al&s;o wa&s;hed to Lint, in a manner, there not being a Piece to be found of it good for any thing; and the Fore-&s;ail was not in much better Condition; for being &s;o rotten, the Sea had wa&s;hed them almo&s;t away, excepting a few good-for-nothing Jags which hung to the Bolt Ropes. The Jibb was pretty much torn, but being a &s;ound, as well as &s;trong Sail, there was a pretty deal of that fit to &s;erve for &s;everal U&s;es, as indeed it afterwards did.</P>
<P>The Blacks &s;aid, If we could any way fa&s;ten and &s;ecure the Ma&s;t, Boom, Bolt&s;prit, &amp;c. till they could have a calm Day, they could tow them up to the Harbour called the <HI>Ovens,</HI> and it might be, they might be &s;erviceable to me one Way or another.</P>
<P>I told them, they would, and if any Ship hap|pened to put in there, that &s;hould want them, I could &s;ell them for &s;omething, which &s;hould be for their Benefit, to help make them Amends for this their Kindne&s;s to me, and the great Trouble they had been at to &s;erve me.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, They were glad they had been of Service to me, and thought it their Duty to &s;erve any Stranger that was in Di&s;tre&s;s, as I was, notwith&s;tanding they were of different Colours, and by us, they believed, accounted different Creatures: Yet they thought we were all of one Species, and they were all Men, as we were, tho' they allowed them&s;elves to be much inferior to us in every thing.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188">
I told them, As for that, I did not &s;ee any Difference, only in the Colour, which I did not know whether it was in their Nature, or whether it might be occa&s;ioned by the exce&s;&s;ive Heat of the Sun, and could not tell but that if a white Man and Woman were to come and live with them, and go naked, and be expo&s;ed to the &s;corching Sun as they were, in Three or Four Generations, they might be changed to their Complexion.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, No; for they had heard, that not|with&s;tanding their Skin might lo&s;e its Whitene&s;s, and change to a reddi&s;h or brown Colour, yet their Hair would always hold its Nature, and not be fri&s;led like theirs, which they took to be an infallible Sign to know a Stranger, let his Colour be what it would, from one of them. They &s;aid moreover, That there was a Cur&s;e laid on them, that they &s;hould always be Subjects and Servants to the Whites.</P>
<P>I told them, I had heard &s;omething of it (being willing to continue them in their E&s;teem of us.)</P>
<P>They &s;aid, They were convinced that I knew it, and believed, there was no White but knew that the Blacks were by God de&s;tined to be their Servants, which was plainly manife&s;t by the white Men coming, as they have been told, every Year to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and carrying away a great many Thou&s;ands to be their Slaves; and if they had not been by the Whites <HI>(i. e. Portugue&s;e)</HI> brought away from <HI>Guinea,</HI> and, as it were, privi|leged, or rather a Freedom indulged to them, as well by the <HI>Brancas</HI> who brought them fir&s;t hither, as al&s;o by all other Strangers, to who&s;e Power they lie open, they might carry them away, and make Slaves of them, as well as tho&s;e of their fir&s;t native Country, whenever they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="189">
They &s;aid, They did not know whether it were a Favour voluntarily given to them by all Na|tions, or procured for them by the <HI>Brancas,</HI> who fir&s;t placed them there; but in Gratitude, they thought them&s;elves obligated to do all the Good they could to Strangers, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in what|&s;oever they were able, and in a more e&s;pecial Manner <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who were always accounted the be&s;t Friends to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and one of who&s;e Kings, they had been told, had married the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Daughter. This I con|firmed to them; and they profe&s;&s;ed abundance of Love, Value, and Re&s;pect to <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> whom, they &s;aid, they e&s;teemed as much as they did the <HI>Portugue&s;e:</HI> Which plea&s;ed me very well, hoping to have friendly Neighbours of them.</P>
<P>They continued, one or other of them, &s;wim|ing about the Wreck all Day, bringing Pieces of Boards, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that had any Paint on them; and filled all the Clefts of the Rocks adja|cent, with Pieces of Wood, Boards, &amp;c. and found both the Iron Pots, and brought them a&s;hore; al&s;o an Iron Crow, a Pair of Stilliards, the Gun that the Pirates had given me, though the Stock was broke, al&s;o a &s;mall Cooper's Adz, which I had found one Day a&s;hore on the Beach at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and &s;everal other Things; all which they put up in the Clefts, &amp;c. of the Rocks, high enough out of the Reach of the Sea.</P>
<P>They all &s;eemed overjoyed that the Pots were found, and &s;aid, That now I might dre&s;s my Victuals my own Way (as though I could dre&s;s it a Jot the more my Way&punc; in the Iron Pot, than I could in one of their Earthen Pots). They found &s;everal other Things, as the Cook's Tormenters, a Pair of Bra&s;s Compa&s;&s;es, and a Pair of Bra&s;s Dividers, a Tin Kettle and Sawcepan,
<PB N="183" REF="190">
a Chi&s;&s;el, a caulking Iron, and &s;everal other trifling Things.</P>
<P>The Manner of their finding them was thus; Several Places about the Wreck, to and from the Water, were &s;o &s;hallow, that they could &s;tand up|on the Tops of the &s;unken Rocks with the Wa|ter up to their Brea&s;ts, their Navels, and in &s;ome Places not &s;o high, and the Sea being pretty &s;mooth, as it always is here in fine Weather (this little Bay of <HI>Punta de Sal,</HI> lying on the Lee-&s;ide of the I&s;land) they could look all round about them on the Bottom, which they could &s;ee very plain, in four, five, or &s;ix Fathom Water, e&s;pecially where the Bottom is Stony or Rocky, and I my &s;elf have &s;een little Shells, &amp;c. from a Rock down to the Bottom, in &s;ix, &s;even, and even in ten, or twelve Fathom Water: And 'tis a common Practice with the Blacks, for their Diver&s;ion, when they have done fi&s;hing, to &s;tand on the Rocks and heave Stones into the Water, and for others to dive and bring them up, at which Exerci&s;e they are very expert, and account it no Piece of Dexteri|ty to dive to the Bottom in four or five Fathom, and when there, to &s;earch and creep along for a Minute, or better.</P>
<P>We put on one of the Pots with &s;ome Pompion, and &s;ome of tho&s;e who went in the Morning to Fi&s;h, came back about Noon with a good Me&s;s, which we boiled with the Pompion, and made a hearty Meal.</P>
<P>The Place of the Bay where we came a&s;hore, was the wor&s;t Place that we could po&s;&s;ibly land at; for they were forced to &s;wim from thence to the Fi&s;hing-places, and al&s;o for Water; though at low Water, a Man might have made &s;hift to crawl along the Rocks to where the Water was, which came out of a Rock &s;tilling down into a hollow Place like a Ci&s;tern; but that way was &s;o trouble|&s;ome,
<PB N="184" REF="191">
as well as dangerous, by Rea&s;on of the Rocks and Stones tumbling very frequently down from the Mountains overhead; that they cho&s;e rather to &s;wim always for the Water, than to go that way for it.</P>
<P>About one or two o'Clock, the Governor &s;ent a Man down to me, to tell me he was very &s;orry for my Misfortune, and gave his Service to me, and de&s;ired, that when I came up to Town, I would make u&s;e of his Hou&s;e as my own, and that I &s;hould not want for any Thing which their poor I&s;land afforded while I remained on it: and withal, &s;ent me down &s;ome Pompion and three or four Po|tatoes; declaring, That his Illne&s;s had prevented his coming down to me, and hoped I would not take it ami&s;s; and al&s;o, that he had &s;ent &s;ome Men out that Morning to hunt for &s;ome wild Goats; but they were not returned, the Me&s;&s;enger &s;aid, when he came from Home; but if they came time enough, he would &s;end me &s;ome that Night; if not, I &s;hould have &s;ome Veni&s;on on the Mor|row, without fail.</P>
<P>I told him, I was obliged to the <HI>Signor Gover|nador,</HI> and thanked him; and a little while after, came a Black from the Prie&s;t, with the &s;ame Com|pliment from him; but brought nothing to eat as the Governor's Black did, and told me, that his Ma&s;ter de&s;ired to know, Whether I had &s;aved any Flower, and if I had, he reque&s;ted me to &s;end him &s;ome by him; and that if I had &s;aved any <HI>Aqua Ardenta</HI> al&s;o, his Ma&s;ter would be no le&s;s glad of it, though he had not bid him ask for any.</P>
<P>I told him, we had very little of either on Board; but our Di&s;tre&s;s was &s;o great, that if there had been never &s;o great a Quantity, we &s;hould not have been able to &s;ave any, when the Sloop run on that Ledge of Rocks; Adding, That all we had been able to &s;ave from the Wreck, was
<PB N="185" REF="192">
the Pieces of Board, &amp;c. which he &s;aw about us, and tho&s;e Iron Pots.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, his Ma&s;ter was more able to do me Service, than even the Governor him&s;elf; and he believed, if I pre&s;ented him one of tho&s;e Pots, it would be very acceptable; and that it would be nothing in Compari&s;on to the Benefit he was capable of doing me in Return.</P>
<P>I told him, That I was &s;orry I had nothing to oblige his Ma&s;ter with, worthy his Acceptance; but &s;hould be proud he would receive from me any Thing that had been left me by my hard For|tune.</P>
<P>About four in the Afternoon, he and the Go|vernor's Black went away; I bid them pre&s;ent my humble Service to their Ma&s;ters, hoping I &s;hould have the Happine&s;s of always continuing in their Favour and E&s;teem, and it &s;hould be my con&s;tant Study and Endeavour to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, I need not doubt it; for their Ma|&s;ters profe&s;s'd abundance of Concern for my Mi&s;|fortune, as well as a great Affection for my Per|&s;on, though unknown to them by Sight; and they both had heard their Ma&s;ters &s;ay, that I &s;hould want for nothing that the I&s;land afforded, while I remained on it; &s;o away they went.</P>
<P>Some time after, among other Blacks that came down, came one called, <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> who was Son to <HI>Antonio Gumms,</HI> who had formerly been Governor of the I&s;land; who, together with his Brother, brought down &s;ome Pompions, Ba|nana's, a Pappai, and a Cake of Bread, made of Banana's and Maiz, which was the fir&s;t Bread I had eat or &s;een, &s;ince I came among them: <HI>Domingo</HI> told me, that his Father &s;ent me the Pompion and Fruit, and his Mother the Cake, and if I lik'd it, &s;he would make me &s;ome more, and &s;end me; and likewi&s;e de&s;ired to know if I lov'd
<PB N="186" REF="193">
Milk; and if I did, I &s;hould have &s;ome &s;ent down.</P>
<P>I thanked them very kindly, and told them, that Milk was what I often u&s;ed to eat in my own Country; and ta&s;ting the Bread, at his De&s;ire, told him I lik'd it very well; and he &s;aid, he was glad of it, and a&s;&s;ured me, that I &s;hould have more.</P>
<P>I thanked him, and told them, I gave them all abundance of Trouble, and had received many Favours from them, but was not in a Capacity of making any &s;uitable Returns, otherways, than by a grateful Acknowledgment of their Kindne&s;&s;es at pre&s;ent; and a Re&s;olution, that if ever God Al|mighty &s;hould be plea&s;ed to make me able here|after, I would make them, as far as in me lay, a grateful Satisfaction.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, They did not de&s;ire any Thing in Return, but to continue in my good E&s;teem, and to let my Country-men know, how kindly I had been u&s;ed among them; and that no other Re|turn would be required by them, or any of the I&s;landers, unle&s;s the Prie&s;t, who they heard was always very craving, as well from Strangers, as al&s;o from the Natives; and therefore, he thought it was convenient to give me this Caution, for fear he might be begging any Thing of me ac|cording to his u&s;ual Wont.</P>
<P>I told him, I had nothing in the World left me here, that would be worth any Body's asking, or my giving.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, that if I had never &s;o much, he was &s;ure no Body would de&s;ire any Thing from me, but would rather give me, if they had any Thing that would be of Service to me, and that the utmo&s;t of what they de&s;ired, was, as he had told me before, to be Noted, and to be had in E&s;teem by Strangers; and were &s;orry that their I&s;land af|forded
<PB N="187" REF="194">
nothing worth the Stranger's while to come and traffick for.</P>
<P>I told them, That I believed, when it plea&s;ed God, that I return'd to my Country, and gave them an Account of their Civility to Strangers, I did not doubt, but &s;ome of our Shipping would come and vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, If their I&s;land had any Production that was worth their while to come and traffick for, it might be &s;o; but that, as far as he could learn, by what he heard from his Father and other old Men, who could remember the coming of &s;e|veral Strangers to it, mo&s;t of whom were of that Nation which had robbed me, <HI>(viz. Pirates,</HI> for they thought it was a particular Nation &s;o called) who, though they u&s;ed me &s;o hardly, he &s;aid, were very civil to them, making large Requitals for every little Favour they were able to &s;hew them; and who would often tell them, that their I&s;land was very poor, and that they lived exceeding mi&s;e|rable, in Compari&s;on of what the white Men did, in their own Country; and that their not having any Production that was good for any Thing, was the Rea&s;on &s;o few Ships came to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>I told him, It was very true, that our Ships &s;el|dom or never came there, becau&s;e it was not known to us, that they had any Commodities worth trafficking for; but that, perhaps, their I&s;land might yield valuable Commodities, but they and we both, might be ignorant of them, or what might be produced in them by Art.</P>
<P>I then in&s;tanced how ignorant the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were of the rich Productions of <HI>Guinea,</HI> at their fir&s;t Di&s;covery of that Coa&s;t, and how little the Inhabitants thereof regarded tho&s;e rich Commo|dities, which it almo&s;t every where afforded, by rea&s;on they knew not the Value of them, nor the manifold U&s;es to which they contributed, both for
<PB N="188" REF="195">
Plea&s;ure and Profit to Mankind; and that in tho&s;e Times, the Blacks &s;et a very incon&s;iderable Value on Gold, and Ambergrea&s;e, and le&s;s on Teeth, Wax, &amp;c. and that they were intirely ignorant of any other U&s;e for their Woods, which now were a con&s;iderable Part of the Trade, but for Firing.</P>
<P>All the Time that was I was talking thus, I ob|&s;erved, that one Man of the Company, li&s;ten'd, with more than ordinary Attention, to our Di&s;|cour&s;e; and ey'd me con&s;tantly, who&s;e Com|plexion was very different from any of tho&s;e I had yet &s;een; for all the re&s;t were black, and had Coal-black frizled Hair, unle&s;s chang'd by Age to Grey, like the Blacks on the Coa&s;t of the main Continent of <HI>Guinea,</HI> but he was of a ruddy, copper, or tawny Colour, &s;omething re&s;embling the <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Arabs</HI> on the Southermo&s;t Parts of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and had &s;trait, tho' &s;hort Hair, and of a light brown Colour.</P>
<P>This Man, as &s;oon as I had fini&s;h'd my Talk, to my exceeding Surprize, as well as Joy, an|&s;wer'd me in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, That what I had &s;aid was very true, and that there were many rich Commodities, to his Knowledge, produced in the Nothermo&s;t Part of <HI>Guinea,</HI> which as well the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as the Natives were utterly ignorant of; they of their U&s;e and Value, and we of their being produced in that Part; and therefore, what might be as plentiful and as ea&s;y got, and perhaps co&s;t le&s;s there, is &s;ought for in other more di&s;tant Places, with greater Difficulty, Danger, and Charge, as he experimently knew, having been an Inhabitant in tho&s;e Parts &s;ome con&s;iderable Time, occa&s;ion'd by Misfortunes, as I might now be here; by which Means he had an Opportunity to ob&s;erve the Commodities produced in the inland Places of that Part of the Continent.</P>

Upon my asking him, What Country-man he was? he told me, <Q>&startq;&endq;He was a <HI>Wel&s;hman</HI> born, and had been Ma&s;ter of &s;everal Ships out of <HI>Bri&s;tol:</HI> That he had been taken by <HI>Bartholomew Ro|berts,</HI> as he was going to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and by him was detain'd, and brought on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> from whom he there made his E&s;cape, and having formerly traded to tho&s;e Parts, as well as to mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> he was acquaint|ed with almo&s;t all the Coa&s;t along: That it was at <HI>Seirra Leon</HI> that he had made his E&s;cape, from Captain <HI>Roberts</HI> the Pirate, and got to a Black King up the River, whom he formerly in his Trading had been acquainted with, who en|tertained him very courteou&s;ly, and promi&s;ed him his Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, again&s;t all that &s;hould oppo&s;e or offer to mole&s;t him:</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;That altho' <HI>Roberts</HI> u&s;ed all his Endeavours to get him again, thro' the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e Blacks whom he had won by his Pre&s;ents, by whom he had offered to the &s;aid King &s;everal Pre&s;ents, of con&s;iderable Value, as the &s;aid Black King told him, yet the King would not except any, but &s;ent <HI>Roberts</HI> Word by the &s;aid Blacks, that he was not of &s;o ba&s;e a Principle, as to be|tray any di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Per&s;on who had fled to him for Succour, e&s;pecially to &s;uch cruel Enemies to all manner of hone&s;t Trade and Traffick, as he under&s;tood they were; and withal, gave him to under&s;tand, that he neither &s;tood in want of his Money, Cloaths, Arms, or Ammunition, having enough of every Sort, and a thou&s;and &s;tout Men, that under&s;tood how to u&s;e Arms, as well as his Men did, for all they were black; and who were always ready to receive him, if he dar'd pre&s;ume to come within his Territories, to offer the lea&s;t Incivility; and that if a thou|&s;and would not be &s;ufficient to make him &s;en&s;i|ble

of his Folly, he would give him the Di|ver&s;ion of being entertained with double, treble, or quadruple the Number.&endq;</Q>
<Q>&startq;That this an&s;wer &s;o daunted <HI>Roberts,</HI> that he &s;trove no more about it, but endeavoured to &s;upply him&s;elf with Water, Wood, and what other Refre&s;hments he could get; and having ob|tained them, he &s;ailed from thence, and pro&s;e|cuted his intended Voyage of crui&s;ing down along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> as far as St. <HI>Thoma,</HI> or <HI>Princes</HI> I&s;land.&endq;</Q>
<P><HI>I asked him his Name? He &s;aid,</HI> <Q>&startq;It was <HI>Charles Franklin,</HI> and that he was born within two Miles of <HI>Carleon,</HI> upon <HI>Usk,</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and that his Father was a Ju&s;tice of Peace, <HI>&amp;c.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>I asked him, How he came here in this bye and unfrequented I&s;land? He &s;aid, <HI>He would inform me of the whole, if I would plea&s;e to hear him;</HI> which, I told him, I would very gladly: Where|upon he proceeded and &s;aid;</P>
<Q>&startq;That after Captain <HI>Roberts,</HI> the Pirate, was &s;ailed, he took the Liberty to range about in the Country, to &s;ee and ob&s;erve what was curi|ous or remarkable, either in the Manners, Cu|&s;toms, and Con&s;titutions of the People, or in the Productions of the Country, and, by one Means or other, Captain <HI>Plunket,</HI> who was Go|vernor of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory, heard, there was a Man who had belonged to <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Com|pany left behind, and entertained by King <HI>Thome,</HI> to whom he &s;ent to deliver him up to him, to puni&s;h him according to Ju&s;tice, and the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.&endq;</Q>

but withal told him, That if he thought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governor would do him any harm, he would by no Means deliver him up; but bid him con&s;ider and advi&s;e him what An&s;wer to &s;end, a&s;&s;uring him, that let his Ca&s;e be how it would, he was re&s;olved to protect him, but withal thought it be&s;t, if he was guilty of any Action which would render him obnoxious to Danger, to acquaint him with it, that he might take the be&s;t Mea&s;ures, both to &s;ecure him from any harm, and to give the Governor as little Di&s;&s;atisfaction as might be.&endq;</Q>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;That he told the King, that he never had been guilty of any ill Action that might make him liable to Puni&s;hment; but, perhaps, the Governor might &s;uppo&s;e he had been one of Captain <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Company, and left behind by chance, and therefore might think he de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed as &s;uch; but he could a&s;&s;ure him he was not, but was forced and kept a Pri&s;oner on board of them, till he made his E&s;cape; but yet told the King, he did not care to be put into the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory, being a Stranger to Governor <HI>Plunket,</HI> as well as to the re&s;t of the Gentlemen of the Factory, who per|haps might conceit him to be one of the Pirates Company, and disbelieve what he &s;aid, and therefore, though unde&s;ervedly, puni&s;h him, as though he had been actually or willingly a Pi|rate; for which Rea&s;on, if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed, he would rather &s;till continue to be under his Protection, till &s;ome Ship came thither to trade, the Captain or Company of which might know his Character or Family, of which he was very certain few Ships that came from <HI>England</HI> to the&s;e Parts to trade, but what the Commanders, or &s;ome Body belonging to them, mu&s;t be ac|quainted with him.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="192" REF="199">
<HI>&startq;That the King upon this gave him his Word, and &s;wore by his Darling God, he &s;hould not, be delivered into the Power of any Body, but by his own choice; and accordingly &s;ent Word to Governor</HI> Plunket, That the White, un|der his Protection, was not of the Pirates Com|pany, but by Compul&s;ion, having been taken by Force, and detained a Pri&s;oner, and e&s;caped from them, when they arrived there, and in order to avoid being taken by them again, had thrown him&s;elf upon his Protection, not being acquainted that there was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory there, which if he had known, without Doubt, he would have apply'd to for Protection: That upon the&s;e Con|&s;iderations, he could do no le&s;s than &s;uccour and defend him, as a Stranger in Di&s;tre&s;s; which he had the rather done, as he was one of the Go|vernor's Countrymen, between whom and him there had always been a good Under&s;tanding.&endq;</Q>
<Q><HI>&startq;That the King al&s;o acquainted the Governor,</HI> that he <HI>(Franklin)</HI> had a Mind to continue with him, to inform him&s;elf of the Cu&s;tom and Trade of his Country: That he approved his Deportment and Conver&s;ation, and therefore gave him Leave to do &s;o; but that, if he thought fit to go to the Governor, or the Governor would &s;end to his Town, to inform him&s;elf farther concerning him, they were equally at Liberty to do &s;o; di&s;claiming all Thoughts of keeping <HI>Franklin</HI> again&s;t his Will, or in Breach of the Friend&s;hip which had always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him&s;elf and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fa|ctory.&endq;</Q>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;That hereupon Governor <HI>Plunket</HI> &s;ent up a white Servant of his, with two Blacks, to inquire into the Matter, and to know <HI>Franklin</HI>'s Name; which as &s;oon as they had been inform'd of, they returned. The Governor taking him for one of that Name who was a notorious Pirate, he

&s;ent Word again to the King, <HI>That he was cer|tainly one of the Pirates, and not what he repre|&s;ented him&s;elf to be, and therefore de&s;ired that the King would deliver him into his Hands; by which Means he would not only manife&s;t him&s;elf to be a Friend to the whole</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Nation, but to the hone&s;t Traders of all Nations.</HI></Q></P>
<Q>&startq;That hereupon the King &s;ent for him again, and acquainted him with the Me&s;&s;age, and told him, that he was very unwilling to give the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Factory of <HI>Sierra Leon</HI> any Di&s;ta&s;te; but was &s;till firm in his Re&s;olution, not to put him into their Hands, if he thought it would be any ways prejudicial to him, or if it was contrary to his Inclination; and, therefore, de&s;ired him to order it &s;o, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might not be di&s;|obliged on one Hand, nor his Safety endanger'd on the other.&endq;</Q>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> then continued to tell us, <Q>&startq;That hav|ing acknowledged the King's Goodne&s;s to him, he de&s;ir'd to be &s;ent farther into the Country, to &s;ome neighbouring King of his Acquain|tance, out of Governor <HI>Plunket</HI>'s Knowledge, and con&s;equently out of his Reach or Influence.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><HI>Upon which I interrupted him, and &s;aid,</HI> I do not &s;ee what Danger or Hazard you could be in, by being in Governor <HI>Plunket</HI>'s Hands; but rather I &s;hould think it would have been the be&s;t Method you could have taken; for they would not have hurt you, if your Ca&s;e had been as you &s;ay.</P>
<P>He reply'd, <Q>&startq;It was very true; neither was he afraid that they could do him any harm, but that there was one of his Name, who had been a Pirate, and a very noted one too; and asked me, If I never had &s;een the Name of <HI>Charles Franklin,</HI> notified in the <HI>London Gazette?&endq;</HI></Q> I told him, I could not then call to Mind that I had.

<PB N="194" REF="201">
to have &s;een it; but he had read it &s;everal Times, and his Name being the &s;ame, he did not care to run him&s;elf into the Danger of a long Confinement, and to be obliged to take his Tryal as a Criminal, being de&s;cended of an ancient and wor&s;hipful Family, none of whom were ever tainted with the lea&s;t Imputation of Guilt either to their King or Country; tho' it was morally impo&s;&s;ible but he &s;hould be ac|quitted of Pyracy, upon a fair Tryal: Be&s;ides, he &s;aid, he had another Rea&s;on to induce him to be &s;ent up the Country, which was a Curio&s;i|ty natural to his Temper, to &s;earch and di&s;co|ver unknown Places; and being &s;en&s;ible that this Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> in general abounded with Gold, beyond any Continent in the World, and having al&s;o learnt from his Conver&s;ation with the Natives, that the Parts far within Land abounded with Gold, and from whence what of that Metal they had, proceeded, it made him de&s;irous to &s;ee into it, now that &s;o plau&s;ible an Occa&s;ion offered, which, perhaps, no <HI>European</HI> ever had before: And this Enquiry, he &s;aid, was the more plea&s;ing to him, becau&s;e having &s;erved an Apprentice&s;hip in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to the Gold&s;mith's Trade, and wrought at it in &s;everal Places, he had attained to a tolerable Knowledge of the Nature of Me|tals and Minerals, and had endeavoured as much as he could, to inform him&s;elf in &s;ome of the greate&s;t My&s;teries of fu&s;ing as well as &s;eparating Metals from Minerals, as well as one Metal from another; and that in his trading on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney,</HI> he had made the nice&s;t Experiments on the mineral Earths, Stones, Sands, &amp;c. and had collected, with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s he was capable of, the Value and Quantity of Metal contained in them, which

Experiments and Ob&s;ervations he had taken down Memorandums in Writing of.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I told him, I hoped to have a farther and bet|ter Opportunity to renew our Di&s;cour&s;e on this Subject; but wi&s;h'd at pre&s;ent he would give me &s;ome Account of the Production of this I&s;land, and of the Temper of the Inhabitants; that I might, &s;ince it was my Lot to be ca&s;t among them, &s;o comport my&s;elf, as to win their Favour, and avoid any Occa&s;ion of di&s;gu&s;ting them. He &s;aid, It was the greate&s;t Happine&s;s he could have hoped for to have a Countryman to conver&s;e with; and would very readily comply with that, and every other Reque&s;t I &s;hould make him, which he was able to &s;atisfy. <Q>&startq;As for this I&s;land, he &s;aid, I might ea&s;ily, at fir&s;t Sight, di&s;cover, that it was exceeding barren, being nothing but one conti|nu'd Rock, as it were, and only here and there in the Clefts and Vallies, cover'd over with a thin Cru&s;t of Earth, which produc'd nothing that would be thought fit Aliment for the hu|man Species by an <HI>European,</HI> who had never been u&s;ed to the&s;e barren rocky Mountains: That, however, <HI>Banana's</HI> grew pretty well in &s;ome of the Vallies, but were nothing near &s;o large as on the Continent: That in &s;everal Places at the Foot of the Mountains, where there is any Earth, Pompions and Potatoes grow pretty well; that they had likewi&s;e a large Quantity of Fe&s;hoons, and wild Figs, which were generally eaten by the Natives for Food; as al&s;o a pretty many Papai's; and that tho&s;e who would take the Pains to plant it, had Maiz enough; but that the Natives were generally &s;o &s;lothful and lazy, that in a great mea&s;ure it was the Cau&s;e of their Poverty: That there was Store of very good Fi&s;h about the I&s;land; and that there had been con&s;iderable Numbers of good
<PB N="196" REF="203">
wild Goats; but that mo&s;t of them had been de&s;troy'd: That &s;ome of the Inhabitants had Cows, Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, and Hogs, of which la&s;t Sort they had the mo&s;t Plenty; but &s;eldom made u&s;e of any of them, except at their publick Fea&s;ts.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I ask'd him, How they caught their Fi&s;h? He told me, <Q>&startq;That &s;ome of them had Fi&s;h-hooks left yet, which they had got when Ships had been there, and others had pre&s;erved Nails, Pieces of Iron, Wire, and the like, which they were very eager to procure at all Opportunities, and very chary of when procured: That there was an old Man on the I&s;land, a Native of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> who had a Hammer and three or four Files, who made Charcoal out of the Wood of the wild Fig-Tree, by Help of which, he made &s;hift to bungle up a Hook out of an old Nail, for doing of which, he had another Nail; and the Party for whom he made the Hook, was always oblig'd, as often as he got a Me&s;s of Fi&s;h, to make him a Pre&s;ent of &s;ome; &s;o that, &s;aid he, the old <HI>Farrier,</HI> as they call him, &s;el|dom wants Fi&s;h, and often &s;upplies his Neigh|bours with &s;ome, when they &s;tand in Need thereof.&endq;</Q> <Q>He added, &startq;That the Fi&s;h about this I&s;land were &s;o voracious, that a bended Nail would take them; &s;o that there was no fear of catching Fi&s;h enough.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was glad there was no Apprehen&s;ion of &s;tarving; and that I could &s;ave &s;o many Nails out of the Pieces of the Wreck which the Blacks brought a&s;hore, that I &s;hould not grudge to give the old Farrier three or four of them for fixing me one, or for lending me his Hammer and Files to make them my&s;elf; for I had made a great many Fi&s;hing-Hooks in my Time with a File&punc; He &s;aid, It would be an ea&s;y Matter for me to
<PB N="197" REF="204">
exceed the Black; for he him&s;elf made all the Hooks that he fi&s;hed with, and likewi&s;e for the Family that he lived among; and that every Body knew them from tho&s;e made by the old Man, and preferr'd them to his: But, &s;aid he, you will have no Occa&s;ion to go a Fi&s;hing; for I will engage, they will &s;upply you with Fi&s;h, or any Thing el&s;e which the I&s;land affords, without your &s;eeking for it.</P>
<P>He added, That they would have been equally civil to him; but that he cho&s;e to fi&s;h for him&s;elf, to divert his melancholy Hours; and that it was principally to this Diver&s;ion, and Hunting, that he ow'd the Pre&s;ervation of his Life, or at lea&s;t his Sen&s;es, in his great Misfortunes. But that, as for Hunting, I &s;hould find very little Plea&s;ure in it, and that it would be even impracticable for me, till my Feet were harden'd, as his were, be|cau&s;e of the clambering up the broken and rotten Rocks, which were equally difficult and dange|rous.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, How long he had been on this I&s;land? He &s;aid, Something above three Years; but he had been on the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip</HI> &s;ome time before he came hither; and when I was di&s;po&s;ed to hear it, he would continue the Rela|tion of his Misfortunes to the Time of his coming upon this I&s;land.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I &s;hould be very much oblig'd to him for the Favour of &s;uch a Relation; and took No|tice, that the two Blacks who came down in Com|pany with him, &s;eem'd, as I thought, by the ex|traordinary Attention which they paid to our Di&s;|cour&s;e, to under&s;tand what we &s;aid.

<P><PB N="198" REF="205">
However, turning to <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> I ask'd him, How he did? and whether he under&s;tood our Language? He &s;aid, No; he wi&s;h'd he did; and that he would give any Thing in his Power to be Ma&s;ter of it; but that he was glad we could un|der&s;tand one another.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Franklin</HI> told them, That I was his Countryman; which &s;eem'd to &s;urprize <HI>Domingo,</HI> who &s;aid, he thought him to be a <HI>Gaulego,</HI> (i. e. a <HI>Wel&s;hman)</HI> and that I was an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, That the Place where Signior <HI>Ca|rolos</HI> (which they pronounce <HI>Singore,</HI> and was the Name that he went by among the Natives) was born, was a Part of <HI>England,</HI> call'd <HI>Gualego,</HI> as the Bay we were then in was call'd the <HI>Bay of the Salt Point,</HI> and yet &s;till was a Part of the I&s;land of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>It &s;oon pa&s;t about among all the Blacks there pre&s;ent, that Singore <HI>Carolos</HI> was an <HI>Engli&s;hman;</HI> and they all &s;everally ask'd me, Whether it was &s;o or no? it being their Manner always to trace any Relation to the Source or Fountain-head, before they will give Credit to it, and not take any Hear|&s;ay Account, if they can get any other.</P>
<P>I &s;atisfy'd their Curio&s;ity; and ask'd <HI>Franklin</HI> What Sort of a Way it was up to their Town? He &s;aid, It was &s;o bad, that I &s;hould never be able to get up it; and the more dangerous, be|cau&s;e the Stones and Rocks were &s;o loo&s;e and rot|ten, that a Man could not be &s;ecure, either in what he re&s;ted on with his Feet, or any Hold he could take with his Hands.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, How &s;o many of them came down, if the Way was &s;o hazardous? He &s;aid, It was hazardous enough for them; and he heard &s;eve|ral of them complain of the Dangerou&s;ne&s;s of the Way, and &s;ay, If they had known it had been &s;o perilous, they would not have ventur'd to come

down; for, &s;aid he, it is to be que&s;tion'd, whe|ther there be one Per&s;on living on the I&s;land, that ever has been down to this Place before now; and it is probable, if it had not been on this Occa|&s;ion, there might never any of them have come here, where we are now. It's true, &s;aid he, they often come down to that black Point that you came round before you anchor'd, to gather Salt for their nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions, from whence, I be|lieve, it took the Name of the <HI>Salt Point;</HI> but then the Rocks where they come down to that, are &s;ound and firm, and though very &s;teep, yet not &s;o &s;teep, by a great deal, as the Way that comes down here.</P>
<P>I objected, That I thought I was as able to get up, as &s;everal ancient Men that I &s;aw, and as he him&s;elf, who was more corpulent than I: But he &s;aid, That U&s;e was a great Matter in that Ca&s;e; and he had been on this I&s;land, and St. <HI>Philips</HI> (which was as bad or wor&s;e) nigh &s;ix Years, and yet, for all that, there were &s;everal of the Natives, who were very ancient, as well as corpulent, and &s;eemingly decrepid through Age, in Compari&s;on of him, yet could climb up Rocks without either Fear or Apprehen&s;ion of Danger, which he nei|ther could, nor dared to attempt; and be&s;ides, he was forced, he &s;aid, to &s;wim near half a Mile, or he &s;hould not have been able to have come hither to me.</P>
<P>How mu&s;t I do then, &s;aid I, if I can proceed no farther, and yet at high Water have not here &s;o much Room to &s;tand, or walk upon, as half a Ship's Quarter-Deck? I &s;hall be wor&s;e than a Per&s;on pent up in a &s;olitary clo&s;e Pri&s;on all his Days.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, He would ask the Blacks; who were mo&s;t of them &s;tanding round about us, li&s;tning as attentively to what we had been di&s;cour&s;ing all
<PB N="200" REF="207">
this Time, as though they had under&s;tood every Word we had &s;aid. He accordingly ask'd them their Opinions, who confirm'd all he &s;aid as to the Difficulty; E&s;pecially; as they &s;aid, that they &s;up|pos'd I could not go without Shoes among &s;uch &s;harp-pointed ragged Rocks, as I &s;hould meet with in the Way. I told them, That was very true; but I &s;uppos'd, that when once a Man had climbed up to the Top of the Rocks, the Way was &s;omething better, and more level.</P>
<P>They &s;aid it was; but that it was a great Way to get to the Top; and ask'd me, Whether I took as far as I could &s;ee to be the Top. I told them, Yea. They &s;aid, That which I &s;aw now, and took to be the Top of the Rocks, was not the hundredth Part of that Height that I mu&s;t climb to, before I could come to the Top; For, &s;aid one, for my Part, I can hardly tell which is the Top. An|other &s;aid, The Middle of the I&s;land is the Top; for the Rocks and Ground ro&s;e continually till one came to the Middle of the I&s;land. <HI>Franklin</HI> hereupon propos'd to them to give me a more in|telligible Account of the difficult Situation of the I&s;land: This di&s;gu&s;ted the Blacks, who thought he pretended to know the Country better than they; and one of them re&s;ented it accordingly, rai&s;ing his Voice, and contracting his Brow, and wonder'd he &s;hould pretend to give a better Ac|count than they could do, who were u&s;ed to tra|vel to &s;uch unfrequented Paths on Account of Fi&s;hing, which he dared not attempt to go in, were he to &s;tarve for want of Food. He ex|cus'd him&s;elf very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, profe&s;&s;ing he did not mean it &s;o, and that he could not pretend to know the I&s;land near &s;o well as they; and that all he could mean was, That being able to di&s;|cour&s;e me in my own Language, he was the more capable to make me under&s;tand what he &s;aid:

<P>Another &s;aid, I needed not to fear a Hor&s;e; for both the Governor and Prie&s;t had &s;ent their Men down to me, to invite me to take up my Abode with them at their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Ay, but, &s;aid another, &s;peaking low, as if I was not to hear him, for my Part, if I was the Captain, I &s;hould rather chu&s;e to lodge with <HI>Singore Antonia Gumms,</HI> than with any one on the I&s;land, he having always a good Stock of every Thing to eat, and more plenty than the Go|vernor.</P>

<P>It's true, &s;aid another; but if the Captain lives with the Prie&s;t, he will beg all his Cloaths from him, and you all know what a covetous Man he is; we cannot make any thing of a hand&s;ome Cotton Cloth Cap, or have any thing el&s;e that is either hand&s;ome or delightful, but pre&s;ently he is begging it from us.

<P>I told them, We never received Forgivene&s;s of our Sins from a Prie&s;t, but always &s;ought it of God alone, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: They &s;aid, Except God or Chri&s;t per&s;onally or &s;en&s;ibly &s;poke to me, and let me know that he had pardoned me, they did not know how I could be &s;atisfied that ever I had Ab&s;olution or Remi&s;&s;ion of my Sins, and con&s;equently, for want of that Know|ledge of being certain whether I was forgiven or not, I &s;hould never know of my being pardoned, and mu&s;t certainly be always full of Fears and Doubts, whether I was in a State to qualify me for Heaven or Hell; but for their Parts, they could not be unprepared of a Certainty of Quali|fication to go to Heaven; unle&s;s, by their own Negligence, they did not repair to the Prie&s;t for Ab&s;olution of all their Sins.</P>
<P>I told them, It was very well if they could purcha&s;e a Remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins at &s;o ea&s;y a Rate, and in &s;o &s;atisfactory a Manner; They &s;aid, Yea, that they could, and the Prie&s;t dared not deny ab&s;olving any Man of his Sins, provided he confe&s;&s;ed them to him; and it would be their own Fault, if they concealed their Sins, that they were not all pardoned.</P>

They reply'd, That they had, indeed, frequently heard him relate his Adventures; but that never|thele&s;s, they were &s;o very extraordinary, that they &s;hould never be tired in hearing them; But how|ever, &s;ince it would contribute to my Satisfaction, they would take Plea&s;ure in attending to his Talk, though they &s;hould not be able to under&s;tand him: And hereupon, turning to <HI>Franklin,</HI> they

<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> No, I &s;hould make &s;hift to under&s;tand the mo&s;t, or at lea&s;t, a great Part of it, and what I did not under&s;tand, rather than make an Interruption in the Story, I would wait another Opportunity, or &s;tay 'till I had a more perfect Idea and Under&s;tanding in the Country Language.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>&s;aid,</HI> He believed he could expre&s;s him&s;elf in &s;uch Words, as both they and the Cap|tain could under&s;tand tolerably well.</P>
<P><HI>They an&s;wered,</HI> No, he would infinitely more oblige them to relate it to the Captain in his own Language; and therefore de&s;ired him to proceed, if I &s;o plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> It would not be good Manners for us to divert our&s;elves in a Language which they under&s;tood not, and would be no le&s;s than an Affront to offer; and e&s;pecially as I knew that it was purely out of Re&s;pect to me, though unde&s;erved at their Hands, that they were thus deprived of their natu|ral Re&s;t, as well as of the Diver&s;ion which they might have at their own Homes; and that it was the lea&s;t that I could do, to endeavour all that in me lay, to be diverting to them, although it were to baulk my own Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> No, they could divert them&s;elves very well; and be&s;ides, they &s;hould take more Delight to hear us talk in our own Language, though they could not under&s;tand a Syllable of it, for the Novelty of it, by far, than it would be to hear it in their own; and de&s;ired him to continue his Story.</P>
<P>Hereupon I de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> if he plea&s;ed, before he proceeded, to favour me with an Account of the Nature and Di&s;po&s;itions of the Inhabitants of this I&s;land, becau&s;e at pre&s;ent it might be of

more Concern and U&s;e to me to know, in order to regulate my&s;elf among them, without giving them any Cau&s;e of Offence, and ingratiate my&s;elf in their Favour, by all Means po&s;&s;ible. As for the farther De&s;cription of the I&s;land, or the Pro|ductions of it, I &s;aid, we would refer that till ano|ther Opportunity, or till I could &s;atisfy my&s;elf ocularly, as not being of &s;o much Importance at pre&s;ent, as the other would, becau&s;e the Igno|rance of their Humours, Cu&s;toms, and Manners, might occa&s;ion me to di&s;oblige them.</P>
<P>He was very ready to comply with my De|&s;ire, and &s;aid, That the People were affable and friendly, and very free of communicating any thing they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, one to another; but in an e&s;pecial Manner to a Stranger, as he could a&s;&s;ert by his own long Experience: That they were not inclinable to be &s;oon affronted; and were very merry and chearful in their Way; and if I could be plea&s;ant and chearful among them, it would inhance their E&s;teem for me, and they would take much more Notice of me, than if I behaved my|&s;elf after a dull and melancholy Manner, or af|fected Solitarine&s;s. I &s;aid, <HI>How can a Man in my Condition be merry? Surely, if they were to &s;ee me merry, or brisk, they mu&s;t needs think that I not only lo&s;t little or nothing, but that al&s;o, I was got into a Country that exceeded mine by far, or el&s;e, that I mu&s;t be a Fool, and incapable of a true Sen&s;e of my Misfortunes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> It was their little Sen&s;e of what a Misfortune was, as having but very little more Thought or Con&s;ideration that Way, than the Bea&s;ts of the Field, nor the lea&s;t Notion, unle&s;s in a very dark and confu&s;ed Manner, of any thing beyond the Exten&s;ion or Limits of their I&s;land; and for that Rea&s;on, <HI>continued he,</HI> they have &s;o little Notion of Misfortunes, not having any thing them&s;elves to lo&s;e,
<PB N="208" REF="215">
that all of them reckon your greate&s;t Misfortune to be the Lo&s;s of your Cloaths, and your pre&s;ent Con|finement here, in not being yet able to get up to their Town: For the re&s;t, they look on it no otherways, than as though one of them had &s;pent Two or Three Days at fi&s;hing, and had lo&s;t their Hooks and Time, and caught nothing; for as to that Part of the Mi&s;|fortune, of being ab&s;ent from your native Country, though to them it would be the greate&s;t Hard&s;hip in the World, yet they think it is nothing to us Stran|gers, as they call us, becau&s;e we are &s;o u&s;ed to it: Neither is it in mortal Power to convince them of the contrary: For all which Rea&s;ons (though I am very &s;en&s;ible that you mu&s;t needs have a deep Sorrow for your pre&s;ent Misfortunes) as well as indeed for the Sake of your own Health, you mu&s;t endeavour, as much as you can, to be chearful; for I know, by my own woful Experience, that nothing impairs the Health more than a &s;ettled Grief.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It was very true, and I was not my&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible of it, as having experimented it be|fore this Time.</P>
<P>After we had di&s;cour&s;ed a little upon this Head, I de&s;ired him, if he plea&s;ed, to fini&s;h the Account of his Adventures, as well while he was in <HI>Guinea,</HI> as al&s;o what occurred till his Arrival on this I&s;land.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;I need not relate to you over again, what I have already done, and therefore &s;hall proceed where I left off.

Line, and perhaps as far Southerly as that Land reaches, made me very &s;olicitous to be &s;ent up the Country by King <HI>Thome;</HI> and what &s;trength|en'd my Curio&s;ity, was the Opportunity now offer'd, which would not leave them the lea&s;t Room to &s;u&s;pect that it was de&s;ign'd upon the Account of making any Remarks or In&s;pection, either into the Con&s;titutions, Polity, or Strength of the Inhabitants, or of the Nature, Pro|ductions, or Riches of the Country; of both which, as far as ever I could learn, the Natives, e&s;pecially tho&s;e within Land, are very jealous, and by that Means are unacquainted either with Strangers, or their Manner of Trade; and by the other Blacks bordering on the Sea-Coa&s;t, this Notion is kept up as much as po&s;&s;ible, per|haps to deter them from venturing down to the Sea-Coa&s;t to vend their Commodities; they prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them with the Fear of being car|ry'd off by the Whites, and likewi&s;e of the great Subtlety, as well as Power, which the <HI>Bacca|rau's,</HI> or Whites, are Ma&s;ters of; in&s;omuch, that the mo&s;t Part of tho&s;e inland Nations do &s;uppo&s;e, that it's entirely owing to their Coun|try being yet undi&s;cover'd by us, that they have hitherto remain'd &s;ecure from being totally &s;ubjected to us; and that whenever we come to know the Riches and Value of the Country, and its exceeding Populou&s;ne&s;s, we &s;hall imme|diately &s;eize upon the Country, and carry them into Slavery in Foreign Countries at our Plea|&s;ure. They believe, that all the Whites think their inland Countries are nothing but wild and barren De&s;arts, frequented only with ravenous and voracious Bea&s;ts, of which they have a mighty Notion that we &s;tand very much in fear; and tell the inland Blacks, that this is the Rea|&s;on the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> do not venture far up the

This happy Time they earne&s;tly wi&s;h for, that they need not &s;tand in fear of being made Slaves. They believe, that the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> trouble not their Heads any

given them as a Caution, that if he was hone&s;t and good, and had no De&s;ign, they would per|ceive it by his not writing; but if otherwi&s;e, he would call to his <HI>Fitteza,</HI> who would not fail to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with Paper, or what el&s;e he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for: And that in this Ca&s;e, they &s;hould not offer any Violence to him them|&s;elves, but immediately deliver him up to the afore&s;aid King of <HI>Aucadingo,</HI> on whom alone the <HI>Fitteza's</HI> of the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> had no Power to act or hurt. At length, continu'd he, we ar|riv'd at King <HI>Bembolu</HI>'s Town, or Court, call it which you plea&s;e; and after the Blacks that conducted me, had &s;hewn the Staff of Credit, and told their Errand, we were receiv'd with abundance of Re&s;pect and Honour; and there was gazing enough upon me, I being the fir&s;t <HI>European</HI> that ever was remember'd to have been up at that Town.</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;I was mightily made much of, &s;aid he, both by King <HI>Bembolu,</HI> and his Nobles, who &s;hew'd me every Thing they thought might contribute to my Diver&s;ion. But having committed every Thing that pa&s;s'd of Conver&s;ation, and what I ob&s;erv'd of Rarities, &amp;c. to Paper, I &s;hall not take up your Time with repeating them now; referring my&s;elf to what I have written, which I will &s;hew you when you can get up to Town, which I hope will not be long.&endq;</Q>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I cannot be &s;atisfy'd how I &s;hall do to get up to the Town, if it be &s;o difficult as you all repre&s;ent it to be.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> That I need not fear, but in a Day or two, if we had any Thing of fine Weather, but they would bring the Boat round here, and carry me up to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> where I &s;hould have a tolerable good Way, which though very &s;teep, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> yet it's very pa&s;&s;able, even for Hor&s;es; although I que&s;tion,
<PB N="215" REF="222">
whether any Hor&s;e in <HI>England</HI> would be able to get up from thence to Town, and yet that's the be&s;t Read reckon'd in all the I&s;land. <HI>And indeed &s;o it is.</HI></P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I &s;ha'nt much mind whether I have a Hor&s;e or not, &s;o I can but make &s;hift to &s;cramble up any how; I only wi&s;h, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I was gone from this Place.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd him,</HI> Whether the Inhabitants knew how to manage a Boat? or, Who it was that would order the Boat down?</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> That it belong'd to a Man call'd <HI>Anto|nio Riverio;</HI> but he believ'd that the Governor would &s;ee to get &s;ome Hands to bring it down for me, as &s;oon as it was fine Weather.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If he thought it would be any Thing difficult, or trouble&s;ome, that I would rather venture to &s;wim cro&s;s the Bay, with the Ma&s;t or Boom, guided by three or four of the Blacks, than give them too much Trouble, or tarry the Uncertainty of their coming.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> It was very po&s;&s;ible I might go over the Bay very &s;afe, in the Manner I propos'd, or even without Ma&s;t, Boom, or any Thing el&s;e to help me, more than the Blacks alone, though the Bay were ten Times as wide as it is: But, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> you need not at all doubt of the Boat being brought down for you as &s;oon as the Weather permits; for I will go to Town my&s;elf to Morrow, and will &s;peak with the Governor, and likewi&s;e with <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> for the Boat; and if no Body el&s;e will, I am &s;ure <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> and his Brother, will come with me; but I rather fear I &s;hall have more offer their Service to go in her, than &s;he will be able to carry, or I care to encumber my&s;elf with.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd him,</HI> How big the Boat was? <HI>and,</HI> How many it required to bring her down?</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="223">
<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> It was but a little Bauble of a Thing; two Men could carry it very ea&s;ily, when it had been &s;ome time out of the Water and dry; but that he had known &s;ix, &s;even, or eight People in her at a Time.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> becau&s;e they did not matter half a Farthing, whether &s;he &s;unk or &s;wam with them, becau&s;e they could always &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;wim|ming, if at any Time they were put to it.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> It was true enough; for they would hardly venture in her farther off the Shore, than they were &s;ure they could &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;wim|ming, if Occa&s;ion &s;o requir'd: Nay, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> and I believe was it never &s;o good a Boat, and never &s;o large, it would be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>What Sort of a Boat is &s;he, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI> or did they make her them&s;elves? Why, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> when you &s;ee her, you will &s;ay you never &s;aw &s;uch a Thing in your Life; but &s;he does well enough to go a fi&s;hing with; and I have been with her my&s;elf, and four more, as far as the little I&s;lands, which you &s;aw as you came along to this I&s;land.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> &s;ure they would not pretend to &s;wim from the little I&s;lands to this I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;miled, and &s;aid,</HI> If it were not for fear of the voracious Fi&s;h, of which there is great Plenty about the&s;e I&s;lands, they would not fear &s;wimming a great Way farther; <HI>and &s;peaking to</HI> Domingo <HI>in the I&s;land Language, he told him what we were talking of, and how I thought it impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to &s;wim from the little I&s;lands</HI> (Guy's) <HI>to the I&s;land of St.</HI> John<HI>'s: At which</HI> Domingo <HI>laugh'd, and &s;aid,</HI> That if it was not for fear of the Fi&s;h, he could &s;wim to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I thought it impo&s;&s;ible for him, or any Body el&s;e, to &s;wim one Quarter &s;o far, not|with&s;tanding I knew that all, or mo&s;t black People,

<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I thought half a Day, or le&s;s, would have been Time enough, and more than enough, to &s;pend the &s;tronge&s;t Man in the World.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> I was much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>told</HI> Domingo, That I was &s;ome|thing fearful of going in the Boat to <HI>Fuurno; who an&s;wer'd,</HI> That if the Boat was to fill with Water as &s;oon as ever we turn'd the <HI>Salt Point,</HI> he would engage, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one more, whom he could pick out, to carry me &s;afe up to the <HI>Fuurno.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It might be &s;o; but I would much ra|ther be carry'd round in the Boat, than put him to the Trouble, or my&s;elf in the Danger.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> As for the Trouble, he &s;hould think it none; and as to Danger, I run none; yet he would much rather that I went round in the Boat, becau&s;e, that in the over&s;etting or filling of the Boat with Water, I might chance to lo&s;e &s;ome of my Things.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> Ay, and your Boat too. No, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we &s;hould not lo&s;e our Boat neither, except it was very bad Weather, and a Lee Current; for, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I am &s;ure in fine Weather, I and three more could bring that Boat &s;afe into the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> if &s;he was to be filled with Water, and half Way over between here and St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s: <HI>He added,</HI> That <HI>Franklin</HI> knew what he &s;aid to be true; who was, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> the knowinge&s;t Man on the I&s;land; nay, and did believe, there were not many white <HI>Piloto's</HI> that knew &s;o much of the Sea, or how to govern a Boat in the Sea, as he did; and therefore, if <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> would go up with him to Morrow, he would go and ask <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> for his Boat, and get as many good Hands as <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> &s;hould think &s;uffici|ent,

if I could di&s;pen&s;e with <HI>Singore</HI>'s Ab&s;ence &s;o long; or if not, he would go him&s;elf, and get the Boat down, and &s;o bring us both up together, with all my Things.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd him, and told him,</HI> If <HI>Singore Caro|los</HI> pleas'd to give him&s;elf the Trouble to go, and come with him, I &s;hould not only be very willing but &s;hould al&s;o take it as a very great Favour.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, He would go up with <HI>Do|mingo</HI> to bring down the Boat for the more Di&s;|patch. After which we fell into other Talk, &s;ometimes about one Thing, and &s;ometimes about another, till at la&s;t <HI>Domingo,</HI> with his Brother, and all the re&s;t of the Blacks fell a&s;leep: After which, upon my De&s;ire, Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> re-a&s;&s;um'd his Di&s;cour&s;e about his la&s;t Adventures, and how he came to be placed on this remote I&s;land. But as the Relation of them would too much break in upon my own Hi&s;tory, and indeed require a Vo|lume of it&s;elf, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent pa&s;s them by, and return to what more immediately relates to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>After our long Di&s;cour&s;e, I began to grow &s;leepy, and laid me down on the Rock, by the Fire Side, in order to take a Nap, and <HI>Franklin</HI> did the &s;ame, and &s;o we fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; <HI>Domingo</HI> in the mean time awaking, took Care of the Fire, and was &s;o kind, as to rai&s;e my Head &s;oftly, and, without waking me, laid it in his Lap, which might be one good Rea&s;on of my not waking till the Morning.</P>
<P>About eight or nine a-Clock in the Forenoon, came down from Town a Parcel of the Natives, to the Number of twelve or fourteen, two of whom were &s;ent by the Governor, with a Side of wild Goat, a couple of Pompions, a Water-Me|lon, a little Calaba&s;h of Milk, containing about a Quart, and with his Service, promi&s;ed me, that
<PB N="219" REF="226">
he would &s;end me more on the Morrow, or next Day, if I tarry'd &s;o long; but hoped to have me up to Town in a Day or two.</P>
<P>He under&s;tood (they &s;aid) what a difficult Place I was got a&s;hore at, it being impo&s;&s;ible, as he was inform'd, for me to climb up the Rocks from where I was; be&s;ides, if it were, he would by no Means have me, for fear I &s;hould tumble down and lo&s;e my Life, the Rocks being, as he was in|form'd, &s;o rotten, that I could not be certain or &s;ecure, either by Foot or Hand-hold; and was &s;orry that I could not &s;wim over the Bay, which if I could, I might then travel up to Town, which though it might &s;eem to me a difficult Way, yet it would then be without any Danger; but he would not have me be troubled at that, for he had bor|row'd a Boat, which was the only one they had on the I&s;land fit to &s;wim; (for he had a Boat him&s;elf, but &s;he had lain, it &s;eems, two Years on the dry Land, and was then in a Manner all to Pieces, neither did they know how to repair her; though afterwards I put them in the Way; but concerning this, he did not &s;end me any Account now, but I under&s;tood it afterwards) but he &s;ent me Word al&s;o, that the Owner would let the Boat come for me, on this Condition only, that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> him&s;elf &s;hould go in the Boat; for el&s;e he would not tru&s;t his Boat to the Management of the Blacks, for fear of lo&s;ing his Boat. And therefore (continu'd the Governor's Man) <HI>Singore Governador</HI> would have you, to get <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> to go up to Town to Night; and if it &s;hould be fine Weather to Morrow, you may be brought up to the <HI>Fuurno.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I thank'd his Ma&s;ter, and would &s;peak directly to <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> about it, who was &s;tanding by all the Time, and heard all our Di&s;|cour&s;e; and preventing my asking him, &s;aid, I
<PB N="220" REF="227">
need not give my&s;elf the Trouble, for he was re&s;olv'd, as he had given me his Word la&s;t Night, as did al&s;o <HI>Singore Domingo Gumms,</HI> to have gone up to Town, in order to have borrow'd the Boat of the&punc; Owner <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> him&s;elf, and like|wi&s;e to have got &s;ome more Blacks to a&s;&s;i&s;t him and <HI>Singore Domingo,</HI> to bring down the Boat from where &s;he was for me; but was glad the Governor had done it to his Hand, not &s;o much upon the Account of &s;aving him the Trou|ble, which, in re&s;pect to whom it was for, (mean|ing me) it would not be any; yet, as it was the Governor's Act, it would prevent any Heart-burn|ing or Jealou&s;y. Why, &s;aid I, what Jealou&s;y or Heart-burning could it occa&s;ion to you, to endea|vour to get me out of this melancholy, di&s;con&s;o|late, as well as dangerous Place, where a Man is not &s;ecure one Moment from being da&s;hed to Pieces, by the Rocks and Stones &s;o frequently tumbling down? and &s;urely, continu'd I in <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> the&s;e People mu&s;t be of a very dangerous, as well as barbarous Principle, to be angry or di&s;|pleas'd with any Per&s;on, for endeavouring to re&s;cue one from the almo&s;t hourly Danger of Death, as we all are threaten'd with, by the &s;o often tumbling down of the Stones from the Mountains.</P>
<P>This mo&s;tly happen'd early in the Mornings, and late in the Evenings, which gave me very good Ground to believe the Rea&s;on which the Blacks gave for it, as they &s;aid by ocular Demon&s;tration, which was, that it was the wild Goats going to their Dens and Caves on the Edge of the Moun|tain, who&s;e Foot was at the Top of the Rock under which we were; for the Land ri&s;es &s;ome|thing like tho&s;e Draughts, which are drawn to re|pre&s;ent the Pyramids of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the Foot of one Mountain being, as it were, the Top of ano|ther, till you de&s;cended to the Sea; and thus they

ri&s;e one above another, till you arrive at the Mid|dle of the I&s;land, which is the highe&s;t; and which, though at a Di&s;tance off at Sea it appears with a rounding Head, yet when you are on the Top of it, it then &s;eems indifferent flat, yet de|clining till you come to the Edges, which then goes down &s;teep, &s;omething like St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupu|lo, ri&s;ing as it were out of the Body of the Church, and at every Height of Pillars, and ends in a roundi&s;h flat Head, &s;uppo&s;ing the Cro&s;s, &amp;c. not to be there.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo Gumms</HI> being al&s;o pre&s;ent when Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;poke to me, and at all our Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid it was Time to be going to Townwards.</P>
<P>To whom Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, It was Time enough after they had got their Dinner. <HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, There was nothing here but only Pomption and Water-Melon to eat, which they could get up at Town, except the Milk which the Governor had &s;ent the Captain, which he thought would be a pity to rob him off.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, He was &s;ure that &s;ome of tho&s;e that went to the <HI>Pi&s;caree Picuana,</HI> would come and bring &s;ome Fi&s;h with them for my Din|ner, and he would &s;tay and eat &s;ome Fi&s;h and Pompion with me before he went to Town. <HI>Do|mingo</HI> &s;aid, He was afraid it would be too late to &s;tay their coming, and after that the boiling of the Fi&s;h and Pompion.</P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, Then he would not &s;tay the boiling of either; but would cut &s;ome Pompion and roa&s;t, and if they brought the Fi&s;h before it was enough, he would take a Fi&s;h and broil it to eat with the Pompion, and if they did not, he would eat a Piece of Pompion, and then walk with him to Town; And, &s;aid he to <HI>Domingo,</HI> What need you be in &s;uch Ha&s;te? You know if we were to go away from hence, to get
<PB N="222" REF="229">
up to <HI>Porto de Cauvra</HI> by Day-light, we can get well enough up to Town by Night, and 'twill be more plea&s;ant to walk then, than in the Day, when the Sun &s;hines &s;o hot.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, As for their getting up, he did not fear that, and for his own Part, he could get up better than mo&s;t of the Blacks on the I&s;land, and even in the Night, if Nece&s;&s;ity required it; but he was urgent to get up to Town before Night, to &s;peak with the Governor and <HI>Antonio Riverio,</HI> that he might procure &s;uch Hands, as he thought proper, to launch the Boat in the Morning before Day, in order, if the fair Wea|ther continued, to be back with me to the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> before the Day Gale came on.</P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, That as for their coming back to <HI>Fuurno</HI> on the Morrow, it would be impo&s;&s;ible, before the Day-Breeze &s;et in; and as they mu&s;t hale the Boat a&s;hore where they could find a Place out of the Danger of the Sea's &s;taving her at high Water, &s;o they mu&s;t wait all Night to take me, and my Things, in the next Morning at Day-break, otherways, they would not be able to row up to <HI>Fuurno</HI> before the Day Breeze &s;et in, by rea&s;on that the Rowl or Set of the Sea, even in a Calm, was always to Leeward; and therefore, he would rather come down in the Afternoon, when the Day-Breeze blew &s;trong down, becau&s;e the Wind would drive the Boat fa&s;ter than they could row in a Calm.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, He knew be&s;t what could be done; but that the Boat being but &s;mall, if I thought well of it, they that intended to go up that Night, would every one carry &s;ome of my Things with them.</P>
<P>I thanked them very kindly; but &s;aid, I had nothing now left me, what with the Pirates, and
<PB N="223" REF="230">
the Sea, that was worth their taking the Pains to carry with &s;o much Jeopardy.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid he, you have &s;till enough left you, to be the riche&s;t Man upon our I&s;land.</P>
<P>At which I &s;miled, and &s;aid, Then the I&s;land is very poor.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, That he was &s;ure I had more Cloaths, than any Two on the I&s;land, not excepting the Prie&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I never had le&s;s in all my Life.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, That might be, and told me, That if I, and <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> thought well of it, he would then al&s;o carry my little Boy with him up to Town.</P>
<P>I told him, I did not think it proper nor &s;afe, and would rather the Boy went up with me when I went.</P>
<P>He told me, As for the Safene&s;s, he would en|gage the Child &s;hould go as &s;afe as he did, and would take it upon him&s;elf to carry him up, and the Child &s;hould come to no Di&s;a&s;ter, but what he &s;hould participate of, and <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> &s;hould be the Judge.</P>
<P>I told him, If he could get the Child up tho&s;e Rocks, which they all along repre&s;ented to me &s;o difficult to a&s;cend, and who, in a manner, was helple&s;s, &s;urely I might, with a little of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, make &s;hift to get up.</P>
<P>He told me, No, for the Rocks were &s;o &s;teep and difficult, as well as rotten and dangerous, that I &s;hould never be able to get up.</P>
<P>Why, &s;aid I, then how can the Child get up? for I am &s;ure I can climb up much better than he.</P>
<P>Why, &s;ays he, I can carry him upon my Back, and that I cannot do you.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="231">
But, &s;aid I, I &s;hould think I could get up any Place that you could carry &s;uch a big Boy as that.</P>

<P>To which Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> made An&s;wer, &s;aying, It was true what <HI>Singore Domingo</HI> &s;aid, for he could with Ea&s;e and Security, he was well a&s;&s;ured, climb up where neither him&s;elf, nor I, could, nor would care to venture.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;aid I, unle&s;s I was &s;ure of the Boys going &s;afe, I would not let him go by any means.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, I need not fear, if <HI>Domingo</HI> took the Charge upon him, for then he was &s;ure he would &s;ooner &s;uffer a Di&s;a&s;ter him&s;elf, than the Boy: Why, &s;aid I, I do not &s;ee any Advantage in &s;ending the Boy up now, and, I think, he may as well go round in the Boat, when I go round; for he could be but little Weight in the Boat.</P>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, That was true enough; but &s;till he thought, &s;ince they de&s;ired it, it would be better to let the Boy go up now; and perhaps, my refu&s;ing might be taken as if I mi&s;tru&s;ted them.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I did not much fear but they would do as well as they could; but was not willing the poor Child &s;hould run any more Hazard, than I did my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, As to the Hazard, he was &s;atisfied there could be none; for if <HI>Domingo</HI> was not &s;ure of carrying him &s;afe up, he would never under|take it; who, to his Knowledge, was &s;o &s;ure-footed, that there was none on the I&s;land could, or dared venture to go where he could; nor could a wild Goat e&s;cape from him, that he had a Mind to catch; and it was his Opinion, That I had be&s;t &s;end the Boy up now.</P>

Well, &s;aid I, in God's Name, I will venture, and if you find any Difficulty in getting the Boat for me, I will then try to get up my&s;elf.</P>

<P>Said I, Don't you reckon this fine Weather that we have now?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid he, and if it continues as it is now, you need not at all doubt, with God's Leave, the Boats being down &s;ome time To-morrow.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I wi&s;h'd and hop'd it would, and thought it be&s;t for them to go the &s;ooner on the Account of the Boy, that they might be pa&s;t the mo&s;t dangerous Part of the Way before it was dark.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, They had Time enough; but <HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, It was better to go now, and then they &s;hould have Day-light all the Way; as likewi&s;e, that it would be &s;omething tedious car|rying the Boy at his Back.</P>
<P>By this Time, they beheld &s;ome of the Blacks, who went from us the preceding Night, (accom|pany'd, as it prov'd, by the three Men I had brought with me from St. <HI>Nicholas)</HI> coming with &s;ome Fi&s;h; whereupon <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, he would broil and eat a Fi&s;h before he went.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, He would not &s;tay upon the Boy's Account; and pre&s;s'd me to let him carry him up then; &s;o I yielded: And Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> told <HI>Do|mingo,</HI> That as they did not go one Way, he be|ing forc'd to &s;wim over the Bay before he could a&s;cend the Rocks, and <HI>Domingo</HI> going with the Boy right up, he might be going on, and as &s;oon as he had eaten his Fi&s;h, he would follow him; and con&s;idering that he had the Boy to carry, he believ'd he &s;hould overtake him, and which ever of them fir&s;t arriv'd at the fir&s;t <HI>Curraal de Vauca,</HI> to &s;tay there till the other came.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="233">
To this <HI>Domingo</HI> con&s;ented; and taking a Cot|ten Sa&s;h, he bound the Boy with it on his Back, and four more Men accompany'd him, and took &s;ome of my old Rags, and &s;ome of the painted Lineing of my Cabbin, which was &s;aved as afore related, and away they went; and after Mr. <HI>Frank|lin</HI> had broil'd and eaten one Fi&s;h, he al&s;o depart|ed, with two or three Blacks who cho&s;e to go his Way, promi&s;ing his utmo&s;t Diligence to bring the Boat, or let me &s;ee him, if any Accident hap|pen'd to hinder his coming with it. The Prie&s;t's and Governor's Men went al&s;o away to Town.</P>
<P>I then turn'd my&s;elf to the three Men I had brought with me from St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> and the fir&s;t Salutation I had from them, was a Weeping and Howling after the Negro Manner, to te&s;tify their Sorrow for my Misfortune, as al&s;o their Re&s;pect to me; and made abundance of Prote&s;tations on that Head; for it &s;eems the Inhabitants had very much blamed them for their leaving, and not a&s;&s;i&s;ting me.</P>
<P>I told them, It was very well; and it being neither a &s;ea&s;onable Time or Place to upbraid them, I made as though they were not much blameable.</P>
<P>One of them, who&s;e Name was <HI>Manuel,</HI> told me, That &s;ince it plea&s;ed God that I had e&s;cap'd with my Life, notwith&s;tanding their Ba&s;ene&s;s in &s;o leaving me, and not a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, which he was heartily a&s;ham'd of, and &s;hould never forgive him|&s;elf for; and having given over all Hopes of ever &s;eeing his Native Land, Wife, or Children, he therefore would dedicate his remaining Days to my Service; and that it was with that Intent he was come down, and was re&s;olv'd not to go up till I went, and de&s;ir'd that I would take him no other|ways than as my Servant, or Slave.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="234">
I thank'd him, and told him, That I only de|&s;ir'd to be e&s;teem'd as a Friend by them, and by all the Natives of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>To which all pre&s;ent an&s;wer'd, That I need not doubt the Friend&s;hip of the whole I&s;land; and they believ'd me to be &s;o good and hone&s;t a <HI>Sin|gore,</HI> that I could not fail of being belov'd by all People where-ever I came; and <HI>Manuel</HI> de&s;ir'd me not to u&s;e any Compliment to him, but to take him as he had freely offer'd him&s;elf to me, and was re&s;olv'd to be no otherwi&s;e than my Slave as long as he liv'd.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, but told him, I was in no Con|dition of providing for my&s;elf, much le&s;s to have Servants to provide for. He told me, He did not offer him&s;elf with that View, but rather that he &s;hould work and provide for me; and that it was his full Re&s;olution, not to leave me while he liv'd: For all which I thank'd him; and &s;o fell into other Di&s;cour&s;e, needle&s;s here to relate, till our Fi&s;h and Pompion were boil'd, which was to|wards Sun-&s;et, whereof I made a hearty Meal, every one forcing upon me three or four times the Quantity of what each of them&s;elves had, and being &s;erv'd on a broken Piece of Calaba&s;h, or, for want of that, on a clean flat Stone ga|ther'd off the Beach; and they were &s;o re&s;pect|ful, that not one of them would pre&s;ume to eat with me, except <HI>Nicholau Verd,</HI> who once took that Liberty, for which he was roundly check'd by all that were then pre&s;ent; and though I often importun'd them to let me eat with them, or &s;ome of the anciente&s;t of them, yet they never would accept of it; but mode&s;tly reply'd, That black Men were made to &s;erve white Men, and that it was honour enough to wait on the Whites, without being their Companions, or Equals.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="235">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it put me even to the Blu&s;h to &s;ee &s;uch Humility, as well as Ho&s;pitality, among&s;t tho&s;e innocent and ignorant poor Creatures, when I con&s;ider'd how va&s;tly they exceed us in tho&s;e Virtues, who pretend to &s;o much Learning and Knowledge: And in particular, their Veneration for Age is extremely laudable and worthy of Imi|tation; they paying a great Regard to their El|ders of all Ranks.</P>
<P>After eating, we pa&s;s'd our Time away as well as our Circum&s;tances would permit, being parti|cularly edify'd by the Charity, Morality, and Kindne&s;s of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, whom, tho' we count Savages or Barbarians, far exceed the Generality of us Chri&s;tians, to our Shame be it &s;poken, tho' we pretend, and really have &s;o many greater Ad|vantages over them.</P>
<P>I was very unea&s;y about the Boy, and longed to hear of his being &s;afe got up the Rocks; and the Morning proving fine Weather, as did al&s;o the Night pa&s;t, gave us all Rea&s;on to expect the Boat down; but in vain.</P>
<P>About Noon it began to blow fre&s;h, and &s;ome of the Blacks &s;wam over to the <HI>Salt Point</HI> to look out for the Boat, and took their fi&s;hing Geer with them, and came back in the Evening with a good Me&s;s of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>I do believe, that I did not more long, or wi&s;h for the Boat, than the&s;e kind-hearted Creatures did, but it was all in vain; and what made us the more impatient, no body came down from Town to tell us the Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>About duski&s;h two of the Blacks went up to know the Occa&s;ion of it; and we pa&s;s'd the Night as well as we could.</P>
<P>Next Day, about Noon, came down two Men from Town, who told us, That <HI>Singore Antonio Riverio</HI> had lent the Boat, and that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="236">
had &s;ent <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> with Hands enough down, and promis'd him&s;elf to follow them: That <HI>Domingo</HI> went down accordingly, and lay all Night at the Boat, and not &s;eeing <HI>Singore Ca|rolos</HI> come, he launch'd the Boat into the Water, and waited till the Sun was up; but no <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> coming, he &s;ent a Man up to Town to know the Rea&s;on of it, who, upon Enquiry, found, that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> went from Town about the fir&s;t Cock-crow, and that they thought he had been down at the Boat, or a good Part of his Journey towards where I was, before then; But, continu'd they, we have as bad News as all that to tell you, which is, That one of the two Men that left you la&s;t Night, can't be heard of: He that went with him &s;ays, That when they went in the Water, one &s;aid to the other, Let us &s;ee which of us can &s;wim cro&s;s the Bay &s;wifte&s;t; and that having out-&s;wam his Con&s;ort a pretty Way, all of a &s;udden he could not hear him; and that he turn'd, and call'd him &s;everal times, but re|ceiving no An&s;wer at all, he made the be&s;t of his Way in a Fright to the other Side of the Bay, and &s;o got a&s;hore, and travell'd in the Night up to Town; and &s;ays, That he does not know, whe|ther it was the Cramp took him, or whether it was a Fi&s;h devour'd him; but however, it &s;o terrify'd them, that never after any of them would ven|ture to &s;wim over that Bay.</P>
<P>I expre&s;s'd my Concern hereat; and ask'd him, Whether he had heard any Thing of the little Boy? He &s;aid, Yes, he was got &s;afe up, and the Governor would fain have had him lived with him, but <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms</HI> would not let him, but kept him with him&s;elf, &s;aying, he had mo&s;t Right to do &s;o; for that his Son <HI>Domingo</HI> had brought him up with great Hazard and Difficulty, and hoped the Captain would not only let him conti|nue
<PB N="230" REF="237">
with him, but al&s;o would him&s;elf take up his Abode with him; and had order'd <HI>Domingo,</HI> and all his Sons, as they tender'd his future Favour, not to neglect their utmo&s;t Diligence to get the Captain up, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I was very glad to hear the Boy was &s;afe, and heartily wi&s;h'd my&s;elf with him.</P>
<P>I heard nothing farther till the next Day in the Afternoon, when <HI>Domingo</HI> came down, and confirm'd to me what the Man had told me the Day before; and that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had order'd him and the Men down, and promis'd to follow them that Night: That thereupon he launch'd the Boat in the Morning to be the more ready, and when to his Surprize he came not, he &s;ent a Man up to Town to know the Rea&s;on, who brought him Word, that he had &s;et out from the Town about Cock-crow, and they thought he had been with us; and, continu'd he, we waited till almo&s;t Night, and then haled the Boat up on the Land again, and &s;o went up to Town, where we had an Account, that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> was taken &s;o bad on the Way, as he was coming down to us, that he was like to die; and that it was by meer Chance he was found, and was brought up to Town on an A&s;s, being &s;o weak, that two Men were forced to &s;upport him: He added, That the Town&s;men were ju&s;t going, if he had not come up, to &s;end them Word to hale the Boat up, if he had launch'd her, and come to Town again, for that <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> would not tru&s;t the Boat without <HI>Singore Carolos;</HI> after which, &s;aid he, my Father would have me come down to acquaint you, and de&s;ires that you would re&s;t contented a little, till it plea&s;e God <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> is better, which if he is not in a little Time, we will make &s;hift, by &s;ome how or other, to get you from hence, &amp;c. And withal, &s;ays he, my Father gives
<PB N="231" REF="238">
his Service to you, and bid me tell you, that your little Boy is &s;afe with him, and hopes he &s;hall have the Honour of entertaining you both, when you come up; and although he is not Go|vernor now, yet he might have continu'd &s;o as long as he pleas'd, and does not doubt, but he &s;hall be able to entertain you as well as any one upon the I&s;land, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I return'd him Thanks for his unmerited Fa|vours; but was not a little troubled at my Di&s;ap|pointment of the Boat, and the more, by Rea&s;on of their Aver&s;ion and fear to &s;wim over the Bay, occa&s;ion'd by the late Di&s;a&s;ter; by which my Hopes that Way were cut off: However, I pa&s;s'd the following Night as well as I could, neither wanting Company, nor enough to eat of the be&s;t the I&s;land afforded.</P>
<P>Next Morning I told <HI>Domingo,</HI> I had a great Mind to try to get up the Rocks. He di&s;&s;waded me all he could, urging the Impo&s;&s;ibility, as well as Danger. I told him, I was &s;ure I could get up any where, where he was able to get up with &s;uch a great Boy, as my Boy was that he carry'd up. He &s;aid, I could not. I told him, If they would a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I would try, and perhaps I might do better than they imagin'd; and if I found that I could not, which I &s;hould never be con|vinc'd of till I try'd, then, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t de&s;i&s;t, and be contented as well as I can, till it plea&s;e God &s;ome other Means offer.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, He was afraid I &s;hould get &s;o high, that it might be very hazardous to get me down again; and was po&s;itive I could not get quite up, nor any one upon the I&s;land with Shoes on. I told him, I would very readily pull my Shoes off, after I had gone as far as I could with them.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239">
Some of the Blacks pre&s;ent &s;aid to <HI>Domingo,</HI> Let us go and a&s;&s;i&s;t him; you &s;ee how de&s;irous he is, and perhaps his Eagerne&s;s may enable him to do better than we think for.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, That I my&s;elf could not be more de&s;irous to get &s;afe up, than he was; but he knew the Impo&s;&s;ibility of it; but however, &s;aid he, to plea&s;e the Captain, and to let him &s;ee that no En|deavour &s;hall be wanting, let us go &s;ix or eight of us, and try what we can do.</P>
<P>So away we went, and <HI>Domingo</HI> led the Way. It was low Water, and we walk'd on the Beach, along by the Foot of the Rock, about three or four large Stones-ca&s;t, till we found one of the be&s;t Places to mount at, tho' God knows bad enough. <HI>Domingo</HI> &s;ent a young Fellow up fir&s;t to try whether the Way was pa&s;&s;able; who &s;oon mounted up out of Sight, and was gone a little above a Quarter of an Hour, and then return'd again, and &s;aid, he had been a good Way up, and that Place was better to go up at, than any other they had yet found out. <HI>Domingo</HI> bid me &s;tay a little, and he would go up a little Way to view it, that I might not be forc'd to come back, perhaps after I had got up &s;ome Part of the Way; for, &s;aid he, we are often forc'd to do &s;o our&s;elves. He accordingly went a little Way, and came down to me again, and &s;aid, it was much the bet|ter Way of any he had &s;een yet. The Rock was pretty &s;teep, but not right Perpendicular, about the Height of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupola, or higher; after which, it &s;eem'd to overhang as much as the lower &s;loped in; but they told me, That after I got up there, there was a good Path in &s;ome Places; &s;o up we got, and I found the Hold that we had with our Feet was &s;o little, that I was forc'd to pull off my Shoes, and they &s;upporting me below, that my Feet &s;hould not &s;lip, and them that was
<PB N="233" REF="240">
got above me, when they attain'd to any Place that they could &s;ecure them&s;elves, (which they could very well do, when they got a Place to fix their Feet upon two or three Inches broad) then they would reach down their long Staffs for me to take hold of, and hale me up, tho&s;e below &s;hoveing me up with their Hands; and when I was out of their Reach that Way, then they would &s;hove me up with their long Staves, till I had attain'd &s;ome Place to hold and &s;ecure my&s;elf with my Feet and Hands, while they &s;hifted higher, and fix'd them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t my a&s;cending another Degree.</P>
<P>When I was about half Way up the fir&s;t Rock, I began to &s;weat with Fear: I looked down but once after I had got any Thing high; but I be|lieve, had I not been &s;upported, I &s;hould have tumbled down: My very Sight dazled; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any one to conceive how it is, except tho&s;e who have been in the like Ca&s;es, nor they neither have the Idea &s;o lively or &s;triking after|wards.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we got up to the fir&s;t Re&s;ting-Place, which, as I told you before, was as high or higher than St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupola at <HI>London,</HI> from the Bot|tom of the Rock, and we had then a flat pretty even Path, which look'd like a Gallery, only want|ing Rails: We walk'd along that Path, which was about three Foot broad, for about half a quarter of a Mile, or more, &s;ometimes de&s;cend|ing, but mo&s;tly a&s;cending; and in &s;ome Places &s;o narrow and dangerous, that they were oblig'd to pa&s;s &s;ome of them fir&s;t, and then reach the End of their Staves to me, while tho&s;e behind bounded me to with their Staves till I got over.</P>
<P>When we had wander'd to the End of that Vein, as I may call it, the Rock was in a Manner Perpendicular, and we could hardly find a Place whereon to fix ones Toe, or Tops of ones Fin|gers,
<PB N="234" REF="241">
which put a Stop to my Journey: They &s;earch'd all about to find a Way pa&s;&s;able for me, but all in vain, and had like to have prov'd fatal to &s;ome of them; for as they &s;earch'd, and climb'd, a great Piece of a rotten crumbly Rock tumbled down; and two of them, of which <HI>Do|mingo</HI> was one, had the narrowe&s;t E&s;cape that ever I knew or heard of; which was thus, One of them was got up a pretty Heighth above the other two, on a Pinacle or Piece of a Rock that &s;tood without the re&s;t; and one of them thru&s;ting and &s;triking at it with his Staff, to &s;ee whether it was hollow, or would bear him, as is their u&s;ual Practice, there tumbled down a huge Piece of Rock that was right over tho&s;e two, who, like two Rats, were clinging to the Rocks with their Feet and Hands: But as Providence would have it, it roul'd offwards, without doing them much Damage, &s;ave the Fright, and a few Scratches, occa&s;ion'd, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by &s;ome of the &s;mall Stones that dropt down after the great Piece of the Rock was fallen; but it rais'd &s;uch a Du&s;t, that the Air, for as far as we could di&s;cern, was all, as it were, in a thick Smoak, and it made &s;uch a terrible Noi&s;e, that I thought all the Rocks over us were coming down upon us; and I verily believe, it was half a quarter of an Hour before the tumbling Pieces of the Rocks reach'd the Bottom, for &s;o long or longer I heard the Sound of them falling; for we were then got a prodigi|ous Height up, and, by our turning and winding, quite out of Sight of the Sea, it being along the Edge of the Mountain, where the Gathering of the Waters is from the Inland in the Rains, and &s;o pa&s;&s;es down to the Sea, making deep Gullies where the Rock is &s;oft, and where not, de&s;cends in great Falls.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242">
After all was quiet, and the Du&s;t laid, we knew not what to do, neither &s;eeing nor hear|ing any of the Three that were gone before us to di&s;cover the Way; at la&s;t, one of them that was with me, after recovering of his Fright, &s;aid, That he believed <HI>Domingo Gums,</HI> and the other Two that were with him, were killed; and that it was their being on that Rock, that made it tumble down: When pre&s;ently, we heard a Whooping and Hollowing, which we an&s;wered, and as &s;oon as they had again de&s;cended down that Precipice, which they had &s;o dangerou&s;ly &s;trove to a&s;cend, they came to us, who all this Time &s;at &s;till, &s;queezing our&s;elves as clo&s;e to the Rock as we could, for fear any more &s;hould tum|ble down. When <HI>Domingo</HI> came to us, he was very much rejoic'd to &s;ee us all well, thinking that we had been clo&s;er after them, and that we had been kill'd by the Rocks that tumbled down; and &s;aid, He thought it was one of the greate&s;t Dangers that ever he was in; And, &s;ays the Man that was a-top, that tumbled the Rock down, I thought that <HI>Domingo,</HI> and all of you were kill'd; and the Noi&s;e of it was &s;o great, that the very Rock trembled whereon I &s;tood, and I expected every Minute it would tumble down, and me with it; but, &s;aid he to me, if you was a little higher than where you are, you might get up more ea&s;ily than what you have already pa&s;s'd; but that it was impo&s;&s;ible, as he thought, for me to get to the Place where he &s;tood when the Rocks fell; neither would he him&s;elf venture to go there again.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, He would rather than any thing that I was down again; and that I mu&s;t not pre|tend to &s;trive to go any higher.</P>
<P>I told him, Except they could find a better Way than this we were now in, I might as well
<PB N="236" REF="243">
lie down here and die, as attempt it. Neither, continu'd I, have I any Hopes of getting this Way; but &s;ure, &s;aid I, that was a better Way that you went, when you carry'd the Boy at your Back, than this that we came now.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, He thought that Way was rather wor&s;e as to climbing, only that the Rocks were &s;omething &s;tronger and firmer than the&s;e; But, &s;aid he, don't be ca&s;t down nor di&s;courag'd at this; the wor&s;t Jobb we have now, is to get you down again, the which, when accompli&s;h'd, you need not doubt your getting up to Town, whether <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> be well or no: And, continu'd he, I wi&s;h <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had tarry'd down with you, and I had gone without him for the Boat, which, had it been &s;o, you would have been at Town before now. As for getting you to Town, added he, I am not a bit concern'd; for I do not fear having the Liberty of the Boat from <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> my&s;elf, if <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> &s;hould not be able to go in her; but if not, I will take her whe|ther he will or not.</P>
<P>Then &s;aid I, they will blame me if any Misfor|tune &s;hould happen to the Boat. He &s;aid, No, he would take all that upon him&s;elf, and knew him&s;elf able &s;o to do, and give any Man upon the I&s;land a Knock on the Pate that &s;hould offer to check or &s;top him, excepting <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> his Father, and <HI>Singore Padre</HI> the Prie&s;t; But, &s;aid he, we mu&s;t now make it our pre&s;ent Endea|vour to get you down again to the Sea, and then leave the re&s;t all to me; after which, you your|&s;elf &s;hall be judge, whether our Family, or the Governor, or Prie&s;t, or any on our I&s;land, de|&s;erves mo&s;t to have the Credit and Honour of en|tertaining you at their Hou&s;e; and hope you will do the Honour to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t careful of your Welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244">
I told him, I was very &s;en&s;ible I could neither honour nor credit any Body, by giving them the Trouble to maintain me, but &s;hould rather take it as an Honour, as well as Charity, done to my&s;elf, that any one on the I&s;land would contribute &s;o far only, as to prevent the Boy's and my &s;tarving, until it pleas'd God of his Mercy to put into our Hands an Opportunity of getting into our own Country again.</P>
<P>He told me, He would have me not to doubt, that all the I&s;land, as well as the Inhabitants, was at my Service.</P>
<P>I told him, I had no Rea&s;on at all to doubt of their Goodne&s;s and Ho&s;pitality towards me, hav|ing receiv'd Proofs enough already, and a very re|markable one but now, by their but late narrow and miraculous e&s;caping the lo&s;ing of their Lives, in endeavouring to &s;erve me; and hoped the Fright of that would not deter them from affording me their further A&s;&s;i&s;tance, without which I could expect nothing le&s;s than inevitably to peri&s;h here, among the&s;e hideous, frightful, and di&s;mal Rocks.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> told me, That all the Difficulty that I &s;hould encounter with more, would be in getting down again to where I came from, and after that he would have me be ea&s;y, and leave the re&s;t to him.</P>
<P>God knows, &s;aid I, how it will be; but, come Life, come Death, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to it; and have this Satisfaction, that if I do peri&s;h, I peri&s;h among tho&s;e who&s;e De&s;ires and Endeavours have not, and, I believe, will not be wanting to extri|cate me, as far as they are able.

<P>I was very ill the whole Night, and a great Part of it was delirious, and &s;o continued the Day following; in the Evening, <HI>Domingo,</HI> and &s;ome more, came down, and was very &s;orrowful to &s;ee me in &s;uch a Condition; mo&s;t of the Afternoon I was pretty &s;en&s;ible, and perceived &s;everal of the Blacks weep, and e&s;pecially <HI>Manuel</HI> and <HI>Domingo,</HI> who often wi&s;hed, that I had not fallen &s;ick be|fore I got to Town, when they &s;hould have been better able to take care of me, and keep me from the Cold.</P>

<P>About the Time that the Goats go to their Dens, there came down a great many Stones and much Du&s;t where we all were, without doing any con|&s;iderable Hurt to any of us, though there hap|pen'd &s;everal Stones to fall pretty nigh me, and a good deal of Earth and Du&s;t upon me; one large Stone fell, I believe, within half a Yard of my Head, which frighted them more than me, for my Sickne&s;s was &s;o extreme, that I was but very little affected with any Apprehen&s;ion of Danger; but <HI>Domingo</HI> and <HI>Manuel</HI> could not be ea&s;y till they mov'd me to a Place, which tho' to them &s;eem'd le&s;s dangerous, yet it was much more in|convenient, there hardly being Room for me to extend my&s;elf, and the lea&s;t Turn would have rowled me of; which, although the Fall would not have been very great, as not being above four or five Foot above the Beech, yet it being all &s;tony, it was not only po&s;&s;ible, but al&s;o very probable, that I might be hurt; and at high Water, there was about a Foot and a half, or two Foot Water, e&s;pecially at Spring Tides, and moderate Weather, the Sea did but little more than come up to the Rock; but my good Atten|dants took Care enough of me, two of them keeping by me all Night, and if I offer'd but to turn, they would be ready, and ask me if I had a mind to turn, which if I &s;aid I had, they would turn me with as much Tenderne&s;s, as a Mother could do her tender Babe; and &s;o they tended me by turns till they thought the Goats were all got out from their Dens, and that the Dan|ger of the Stones tumbling down was over; and then they remov'd me where I had &s;omething more Room, and al&s;o contriv'd a Sort of an Auning or Shade for me from the Sun; after which, <HI>Do|mingo</HI>

<P><HI>Domingo</HI> came down again that Night, and his Brother <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> with &s;ome other of the Blacks, and brought with them &s;ome Milk, Pompion, &amp;c. and the Hammock, which had been fix'd ready for hanging up, at Town, by Mr. <HI>Franklin;</HI> and they found Means to hang it up at the Side of the Rock by &s;ome Nobs that &s;tuck out, and ju&s;t high enough, that the Sea could not &s;low up to me; tho' when it blew hard, that the Sea rowl'd in, and beat in again&s;t the Rocks, the Spray would oftentimes fall into my Hammock, and make me as wet as if I had been dipped in the Sea.</P>
<P>They catch'd two Quails, which they had knock'd down in the Way as they came along, and &s;ome others brought down a couple of Fowls; neither wanted I any thing all the Time I was there, nor after that I could be got upon the I&s;land; and <HI>Manuel</HI> con&s;tantly tended me Night and Day with a Tenderne&s;s that is not common; be&s;ides it was very &s;eldom, but what there was &s;ome of the Inhabitants down with him.</P>
<P>I was pretty much delirious, in&s;omuch, that &s;ometimes, as they have &s;ince told me, they were

to &s;tand in the Water, when it was full Sea, to keep me in my Hammock, their Tenderne&s;s not permitting them to tye me down; neither would they, during the whole Time of my Illne&s;s, tell me any Thing I did, or what I &s;aid in my rav|ing Fits, becau&s;e, as they afterwards told me, they would not di&s;courage me.</P>
<P>I had a tolerable Bed to lie on, made up of Pieces of Sails doubled, and laid in the Ham|mock, and my Bed-tick &s;mooth over that; but they had taken all the Feathers out and flung them away, becau&s;e they were wet; on that was &s;pread a Cotton Cloth, and another Cotton Cloth was laid over me, and on that my Rug, which they had al&s;o &s;aved; &s;o that con&s;idering where I was, I may &s;ay I was extraordinarily accommo|dated.</P>
<P>A high burning continual Fever held me near about a Month; after which I was le&s;s delirious, but extreme weak, not being able &s;o much as to turn my&s;elf; and in the Spring Tides I u&s;ed to be often wet with the Spray of the Sea da&s;hing again&s;t the Rock where I hung, and then in the Morning they would take me out of my Ham|mock, and &s;pread the Things and dry them; and during the Time that I was out of the Hammock, one or another u&s;ed to lay my Head in their Laps, or &s;ometimes &s;et me on their Laps leaning again&s;t their Brea&s;t, or any Way which I found mo&s;t ea&s;y; and I believe I was trouble&s;ome enough to them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trouble the Readers with one In&s;tance of the Strength of my Delirium: One Night, when the Water was down, &s;o that the Beach was dry, I had a Notion came into my Head that I could very ea&s;ily go up the Rocks, and thought, in my Imagination, that I had &s;een a Way never di&s;co|ver'd by the Natives, which I thought I could

very ea&s;ily get up; and looking about me, de|&s;igning to get away without any Body's di&s;cover|ing me, I pleas'd my&s;elf to think how I &s;hould &s;urprize all the Town to &s;ee me there, who would be apt to think I had &s;ome &s;upernatural Help. I thought I was &s;o &s;trong, that I was able almo&s;t to do any Thing; and every one being &s;itting about the Fire on the Top of the Rock, which I could &s;ee as I lay in the Hammock, I got out without making any Noi&s;e, and was going along as ea&s;y as I could, that I might not be di&s;cover'd, when <HI>Manuel</HI> &s;pying me, came running to me, and ask'd me, Where I was going? I told him, I was going to Town. He &s;aid, He wi&s;h'd with all his Heart I was able. I told him, I was able enough. He &s;aid, No; and begg'd me to go with him back to the Hammock. No, I told him, I would go to Town. He &s;aid, That when I was well, I could not get up; and how could I pre|tend to it now I was ill? I told him, I was as well as ever I was in my Life, and as &s;trong, (and in|deed &s;o I thought I was) and was re&s;olv'd to be up at Town before Day-light. He de&s;ir'd me to go to my Hammock, and &s;tay till Day-light, and then I &s;hould &s;ee to walk better. I told him, I had lain &s;o long in the Hammock, that I was tired of it. Then &s;aid he, Come and &s;it down by the Fire with us till Day, and we will all go toge|ther. For, &s;aid he, you know that not one of the I&s;landers will venture to go up the Rocks in the Night. Pi&s;h, &s;aid I, I know a Way that ne'er a one on the I&s;land knows. Pray, &s;ays he, let me per&s;uade you either to go to your Hammock, or come and &s;it down by the Fire with us. I &s;aid, No; I was &s;trong and well enough, and perfectly knew every Step of the Way. How can that be, &s;aid he, and you never was up that, nor any other Way on this I&s;land, in your Life? No Matter for
<PB N="247" REF="256">
that, &s;aid I, I have been &s;hewn the Way, and have &s;een, that if I was to go it a thou&s;and Times, or oft$er, I could not know it better than I now do; and therefore am re&s;olv'd to go now, while I have the Knowledge of it &s;o fre&s;h in my Mind, le&s;t God Almighty, who has &s;hew'd it me, may perhaps take away my Knowledge To-mor|row; And, &s;aid I, it &s;ignifies nothing your talk|ing, I will go to Town now, while I can, and will not any longer tarry here. Well, &s;aid he, if you are re&s;olv'd to go, I will go with you, and I will put a Cotten Cloth about you, that you may not catch cold (for I was all this Time &s;tanding &s;tark naked). Well do, &s;aid I, and bring a Stick for me, to have in my Hand to keep off the Dogs when we come into Town, for I reckon we &s;hall be there a good while before Day. Ay, &s;aid he, and it will help you to walk. No, &s;aid I, the Way that I &s;hall lead you, you may walk it very ea&s;ily without a Stick; but I would not have you &s;hew it to any body, that they may admire how we got up, and the more for coming up in the Night.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, He would not; and brought a Cot|ten Cloth out of the Hammock, and borrow'd a Stick of one of the Blacks who was &s;itting at the Fire, telling them where I was going, and what I &s;aid.

<P><HI>Manuel</HI> &s;oon return'd, and brought me a Stick as I had de&s;ir'd him, and a Cloth, which he ty'd about me after the Negro Fa&s;hion, and away we trudg'd; I being, I thought, as &s;trong and hear|ty as ever I was in my Life: But we had not walk'd above a Stones-ca&s;t or two, before my Delirium began to leave me, and with that all my imaginary Strength, &s;o that I was unable to help my&s;elf; and <HI>Manuel</HI> had enough to do to &s;et me on my Legs again, and began to per&s;uade me to go back with him to the Fire, or to lie down in the Hammock again; but I would not hear any Thing that Way, but bid him go his way to his Con&s;orts, for that I could find the Way to Town without any body's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;hoved him from me; who letting me go, I dropp'd down thro' extreme Weakne&s;s.</P>

<P>When I awaked from this Lethargy, I was ju&s;t, I thought, as though I had ri&s;en out of a &s;weet Sleep, not thinking, nor they telling me then, it had been a Nap of three Days.</P>

It was a little before that, that Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> being &s;omething recover'd, came down to &s;ee me; but was gone before I awaked out of that long Sleep, and &s;trictly enjoin'd them, before he went, to be &s;ure to take Care of me, while any Life remain'd in me; but as &s;oon as ever they perceiv'd me dead, to &s;end directly to him, and he would, if able, come down.

Let us get him down to the Boat before any more falls, and thank God he has &s;o narrowly e&s;cap'd; &s;o away they took me four of them, and carry'd me down to the Boat, and put what they thought worth carrying away, into it; and away we went, and got up to <HI>Fuurno</HI> about two Hours before Sun-&s;et, where they brought me a&s;hore, and laid me in a little Cave, upon a Bed which they made me of dry'd Gra&s;s which they gather'd, and cover'd me with the Rug and Cloaths they brought up in the Boat; and kindled a Fire at the Mouth of the Cave.</P>
<P>They told me, That they did not, when they tame away, de&s;ign to have come back to <HI>Fuurno</HI> till the next Morning; nor, they believ'd, had not, if it had not been for that unlucky Di&s;a&s;ter of the Rocks falling and killing <HI>Manuel,</HI> and hurting me, and therefore expected no Hor&s;es down for me till Morning; at which Time <HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, his Brother would be down with a Hor&s;e from his Father, and hoped I would do their Father the Honour to lodge with him.</P>
<P>I can't tell whether it was with the Joy of my Deliverance from that di&s;mal Place, or how; but I found my&s;elf more hearty, and could &s;peak &s;o as to be intelligible without &s;training, or making me &s;o faint as it u&s;ed to do for &s;ome Time pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Domingo,</HI> That it could be no Honour; and that I &s;hould give abundance of Trouble to who&s;oever entertain'd me; and I thought I ow'd more Obligations to him than to any one on the I&s;land, and therefore, &s;ince he was &s;o good as to de&s;ire it, I would give him that Trouble and Charge.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="261">
He told me, The Governor, he believ'd, would &s;end a Hor&s;e for me al&s;o; but de&s;ir'd that I would ride up on his Father's Hor&s;e, &s;ince I had pro|mis'd him to take up my abode with him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> told <HI>Domingo,</HI> That &s;ince I had given my Word to lodge with his Father, he need &s;ay no more about it, for that it was the Property of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, &s;ooner to die than to go from it.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> &s;aid, He believ'd it; and went away directly to carry up the joyful News, as he call'd it, of my &s;afe Arrival at the <HI>Fuurno.</HI> Next Morning betimes he return'd, with &s;everal of the Blacks, and his Brother, who brought a Hor&s;e for me: The Governor al&s;o &s;ent a Man and Hor&s;e for me.</P>
<P>My Fever had in a Manner left me; but I was &s;o weak, that when I was &s;et on my Feet, I could not &s;tand a Moment without being &s;upported; and Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;aid, That the Governor's Hor&s;e was the quiete&s;t, as well as &s;ecure&s;t to carry me, and the Saddle was the deepe&s;t, and ea&s;ie&s;t for me to &s;it upon, and &s;o propos'd that I &s;hould ride up on that, which <HI>Domingo,</HI> with &s;ome Reluctancy, for fear the Governor &s;hould take it as an Obliga|tion for me to live with him, comply'd with, upon my repeated Promi&s;e that I would take up my Abode at his Father's; and after they had well girted and &s;ecur'd the Saddle, they &s;et me on the Governor's Hor&s;e; and, for the greater Security, tied my Feet under the Hor&s;e's Belly with a Cot|ten Sa&s;h, much as they do a Criminal; the Pum|mel of the Saddle afore being as high almo&s;t as the Pitt of my Stomach, and it was as high be|hind; and they fa&s;ten'd me &s;o, that if I had been dead, or a&s;leep, I could not fall: They then put the Hor&s;e in the Path, and turn'd him loo&s;e, and bid me not fear, for he knew his Way home;
<PB N="253" REF="262">
and away went the Hor&s;e afore a good Pace, but did not trot; and never &s;tay'd till he came to the Governor's Hut Door, who, with &s;everal of his Relations, and a good many others, was ready to receive him.</P>
<P>I was up &s;ome time before the Blacks; and the Governor welcomed me with all the Signs of Joy imaginable, and excus'd him&s;elf for not coming down to me at the <HI>Salt Point Bay,</HI> by Rea&s;on of his Illne&s;s, &amp;c. but now I was come up, he would endeavour to make Amends to me for that, &amp;c. and told me, His Hou&s;e, him&s;elf, his Family, his Friends, and all that the I&s;land afforded, was at my Service, and he him&s;elf would be to me in the Room of my <HI>Manuel</HI> whom I had lo&s;t, and which he was very &s;orry for, &s;ince he heard, he &s;aid, he was an affectionate and faithful Servant; and order'd to unloo&s;e me, and take me down off the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him, I was extremely oblig'd to him, and all the <HI>Singores</HI> on the I&s;land; and, if he pleas'd to hear me without being angry, I would give him my Rea&s;ons, why I could not po&s;&s;ibly take up my Abode with him, without incurring the Di&s;plea&s;ure of <HI>Singore Padre</HI> to both him&s;elf and me, and what the Con&s;equence of that might be, I believ'd him to be a better Judge than my&s;elf; which was, that <HI>Singore Padre</HI> was the fir&s;t that offer'd me his Hou&s;e, as he was the &s;econd: Now, continu'd I, if I &s;hould lodge at the <HI>Padre</HI>'s Hou&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e you would have taken it ill of me, and I am inform'd, that if I lodge at your Hou&s;e, he will do both you and me all the Preju|dice that lies in his Power.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid he, I know that he loves me but from the Teeth outwards; I have been upon my Guard a great while; I know he is &s;piteful and malici|ous enough, but I do not value him tho' he's a
<PB N="254" REF="263">
<HI>Padre;</HI> but it may be, that out of Malice he may, &s;ome Way or other, privately do you a Prejudice, but openly he &s;hall not; and tho' for your Rea&s;ons given, I could agree to your living with any one el&s;e on the I&s;land, yet I never &s;hall agree to your Lodging at the <HI>Padre</HI>'s. I know, &s;aid he, his Eagerne&s;s to have you live with him, is not out of Re&s;pect to Strangers, but for what he can get from you.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;aid I, he can expect nothing from me, I having been robb'd of every Thing before I came here.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, &s;aid he, you have Cloaths, and he will be glad to get &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays I, if you will be contented for me to live at another Hou&s;e, I will give you my Word I will not live at the Prie&s;t's.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, So it were with one that he thought would take Care of me, he would.</P>
<P>I reply'd, That to avoid giving any Offence, or, at lea&s;t, as little as I could, to any Party, I thought it be&s;t to go to <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;aid, I did very prudently, as we Whites alway$ did; and he liked <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> very well, he being a good Man, and having a better Hou&s;e by far to entertain me in, than his; but hoped, when I was able to walk abroad, that I would not be a Stranger to his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him, I &s;hould not: At which he &s;eem'd &s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P>By this Time the People who follow'd me came up; and tho' the Governor was &s;way'd &s;o with the Rea&s;ons that I gave him, &s;o as to be &s;atisfy'd with my going to live at <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms,</HI> yet &s;ome of his Friends pre&s;ent were not; and began to &s;ay one to another, that this was owing to <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> and to <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> and that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> ought to be cha&s;tiz'd for his
<PB N="255" REF="264">
In&s;olence; who being but a Stranger, &s;hould take that Liberty to per&s;wade the Captain not to live with the <HI>Singore Governador.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> over-hearing them, &s;aid, It was fal&s;e, to &s;ay that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had any Hand in per|&s;wading <HI>Singore Capiteen</HI> to live at his Father's; it was he him&s;elf that did it; and his Father was as well able to accommodate <HI>Singore Capiteen,</HI> as <HI>Sin|gore Governador</HI> was; and his Father was <HI>Gover|nador</HI> when <HI>Singore Luonell Gon&s;alvo</HI> (that was the pre&s;ent Governor's Name) was but a Boy, and might, if he pleas'd, have been Governor now, but that he was old, and would not take the Trouble upon him; and that Man that &s;hould &s;ay that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had a Hand in per&s;wading the <HI>Capiteen,</HI> he had a <HI>Faukade</HI> ready for him; and immediately drew out a long &s;harp-pointed Knife.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> told them, That he did not per|&s;wade me either to one Hou&s;e, or another; but that I had promis'd, at the repeated Reque&s;t of <HI>Domingo,</HI> to go to his Father's, le&s;t I &s;hould di&s;|oblige either the Governor or the <HI>Padre.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Excu&s;e, one of them up with his Stick to &s;trike at Mr. <HI>Franklin;</HI> but <HI>Do|mingo</HI> gave him &s;uch a Rap on the Head with his Stick, that he lay'd him down as quiet as if he had been in his la&s;t Sleep, for &s;ome Minutes; which put them all into &s;uch a Ferment, that the Gover|nor, fearing it might be of no good Con&s;equence to me, got me into his Hou&s;e; leaving Orders to apprehend and make a Pri&s;oner of him, who fir&s;t lifted his Stick to &s;trike Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> as being the fir&s;t Breaker of the Peace; And this, indeed, was the mo&s;t prudent Way he could have acted, to prevent a Commotion among them; and this intirely put a Stop to their forming Parties, which they were going to do.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="265">
After I was brought into the Hou&s;e, the Go|vernor &s;hew'd me the Bed which he had made up for me, in hopes that I would have remain'd with him; but he was, as he told me before, &s;atisfied (to prevent giving Offence) at my living with <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> whom all the I&s;land re&s;pected; but &s;ince I was alighted, he would have me &s;tay at his Hou&s;e till the Cool of the Evening, and then he would &s;end me down to <HI>Singore Antonio</HI>'s; &s;o I was lay'd on the Bed, which indeed was ex|traordinary, con&s;idering the People and Country; for there were four Po&s;ts drove into the Floor, in the Form of a long Square, and four Pieces of Wood tied to them with Banana Cords, which form'd the Head, Feet, and Sides of the Bed, and three or four Sticks laid acro&s;s, and tied at each End to the two Pieces that made the Sides of the Bed; over that was lay'd a Hurdle made of large Cane Reed, being the &s;ame Sort which is brought out of <HI>Portugal,</HI> &amp;c. over the Cane Hurdle was good Store of dry'd Banana. Leaves, laid after the &s;ame Manner as the poorer Sort of the Native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> do their Beds of Straw; over the Banana Leaves was laid a Banana Mat, and on that two white Cotten Cloths as Sheets, with a thick blue-and-white Cotten Cloth over all, as a Rug or Quilt.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in de&s;cribing this Bed, becau&s;e Beds are not u&s;ual there, they all lying on the Ground, and, as he told me, it was of his Brother's Contrivance, who had liv'd &s;ome Time at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and had been once at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where he &s;aw tho&s;e Sort of Beds there, u&s;ed by the <HI>Branca's</HI> (i. e. <HI>Portugue&s;e)</HI> inhabiting there; and &s;aid, He was &s;ure there was ne'er ano|ther Bed upon the I&s;land of that Sort, except one that his Brother made for <HI>Singore Padre;</HI> and he would keep it always ready for me, again&s;t I was
<PB N="257" REF="266">
recover'd, in hopes I would pa&s;s a Night now and then with him; which I &s;aid I would, &s;o it gave no Offence. He &s;aid, He would beg that Favour of <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> who he was &s;ure would not deny him.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner who had begun the Fray, was bound Hand and Foot, and put in the Governor's Hou&s;e, and &s;o remain'd till next Day; and upon all Parties becoming Friends again, he was &s;et free.</P>
<P>I had a Fowl boil'd for me, and I &s;upp'd a little of the Broth; and in the Cool of the Even|ing I was carry'd down in my Hammock, by the Inhabitants on their Shoulders, it being fix'd on a Pole by Mr. <HI>Franklin.</HI> I was joyfully receiv'd by <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> who told me, Since I had been &s;o kind to come to live with him, notwith|&s;tanding I had been &s;o importun'd by the Prie&s;t and Governor, he reckon'd him&s;elf and all his Family &s;o highly obligated to me, that all that they could do for me was much too little. And, indeed, he made it appear that what he &s;aid was &s;incere; for during the whole Time that I continu'd ill and weak, which was about &s;ix Weeks more, the good old Man would tru&s;t neither his Wife, who was al&s;o a good tender and motherly old Woman, nor any of his Children, nor even <HI>Domingo,</HI> either to make up my Bed, which was done every Night, or to lift me out while it was made, or to &s;erve me with my Victuals; but did all him&s;elf; often telling me, that it was the greate&s;t Honour he ever had in his Life, to be my Servitor.</P>
<P>My Bed was of the &s;ame Fa&s;hion of that which I de&s;crib'd before at the Governor's; for the old Man, as &s;oon as he had any A&s;&s;urance of my coming to his Hou&s;e, went to the Prie&s;t's, to &s;ee how his Bed was made, and by that Pattern fix'd
<PB N="258" REF="267">
one for me, after the <HI>Branca's</HI> Fa&s;hion, as they call'd it.</P>
<P>During the Time of my Illne&s;s, every Day &s;ome or other of the Inhabitants would come to &s;ee how I did; but never hardly any of them came without bringing &s;omething for me, either a Fowl, &s;ome Banana's, Indian Corn, and Banana Cakes, Pompion, Water-Melons, &amp;c. according as they had; but <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> very &s;eldom let them come into the Hou&s;e, excepting &s;ome few of the better Sort, for fear of di&s;turbing me, but receiv'd their Offering at the Door, and there an&s;wer'd them how I did, and return'd them Thanks for their Pre&s;ents on my Behalf.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;t paid me a Vi&s;it the next Day after I came up; and the Governor u&s;ed to come and &s;ee me almo&s;t every Day; and every two or three Days &s;ent me, &s;ometimes a Quarter, &s;ome|times a Side, and &s;ometimes a whole Carca&s;s of a wild Goat.</P>
<P>After I began to gather Strength, that I could dre&s;s my&s;elf and &s;it up, they u&s;ed to be admitted in; for then <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> thought, he &s;aid, that Company might divert me, and do me good.</P>
<P>When I came to be able to eat pretty well, and could take a Walk out in the Air, which was about two Months after I came up to Town, I told <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> that I began to be pretty well, I thank'd God, and all the good People of the I&s;land, and in a particular Manner him&s;elf, and <HI>Domingo,</HI> who, under God, was a great In|&s;trument of &s;aving my Life; and that now my Stomach was pretty &s;trong, I would endeavour to eat as they did, <HI>viz.</HI> Pompion, Fe&s;hoon, parch'd Indian Corn, &amp;c. and that I reckon'd I had de|&s;troy'd his Stock of Fowls already. (which was the large&s;t Stock that any four on the I&s;land had
<PB N="259" REF="268">
be&s;ides him&s;elf). He &s;aid, I had not de&s;troy'd his Stock, for they were not his Fowls that I eat, but my own. I told him, It was his Goodne&s;s to make them &s;o. He &s;aid, No; they were my own properly, and were given to me by the <HI>Singores,</HI> who came daily to &s;ee me in the Time of my Sickne&s;s: And, &s;ays he, How many Fowls do you think you have yet left alive? I told him, I could not tell; neither did I know that I had any. Why, &s;aid he, you have more Fowls, I be|lieve, than I; and calling his <HI>Singora Muritia,</HI> (which was his Wife's Name) he ask'd her, How many Fowls the Captain had left alive? who told him fifty-one, or fifty-two. I was in amaze at it, and &s;aid, I was indebted to all the <HI>Singores</HI> of the I&s;land more than ever I &s;hould be able to pay.</P>
<P>He &s;miled, and &s;aid, That to help any one that was in Need, but more e&s;pecially a Stranger, was a Duty incumbent on every one; and that if any of them &s;hould ever happen to be in the like Circum&s;tances in my Country, it would be then a Duty in me to do the &s;ame for them; and he did not doubt but I &s;hould have been of that Opi|nion, if I had never been on this I&s;land, and re|ceiv'd Kindne&s;s from them.</P>
<P>After I was able to walk Abroad, I had every Day Invitations, till I had vi&s;ited all the Inhabi|tants Hou&s;es or Huts on the I&s;land, except the <HI>Fite&s;eers (i. e.</HI> Witches) Hou&s;es; again&s;t which, my Landlord, as al&s;o the Governor, and the Prie&s;t, gave me a Caution, neither to eat, nor drink, nor have any Intimacy or Acquaintance with them, but as little as I could.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Vi&s;it I paid (for which I ask'd the Governor's Leave, and praying him not to be offended at it, which he readily granted, and pro|mis'd not in the lea&s;t) was to the Prie&s;t, who took
<PB N="260" REF="269">
it very kind, that I had done him the fir&s;t Favour at my fir&s;t going Abroad; the next was to the Governor; and after him to <HI>Singore George Gon|&s;alvo,</HI> who had formerly been a Governor; and then to the re&s;t in order, according to their Seni|ority, as my Landlord <HI>Antonio Gumms</HI> directed me, who&s;e Advice in that Affair I wholly fol|low'd.</P>
<P>I now began to be pretty &s;trong and hearty, and u&s;ed to go out with the Natives a hunting and fi&s;hing; the la&s;t I u&s;ed often to be at, as being more diverting and le&s;s fatiguing.</P>
<P>I had Nails enow &s;av'd out of the Pieces of the Wreck, to have &s;upply'd the I&s;land perhaps an Age, or more, with Fi&s;hing-Hooks; for all that the Natives had &s;av'd and knock'd out with Stones, they brought to me, after I was come up to <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms;</HI> for the Prie&s;t had told them, That if they kept any thing that they had &s;av'd, of what Kind &s;oever, from me, God would certainly take Vengeance of them, and they would never thrive, nor pro&s;per in any thing that they undertook; &s;o that I had every Bit of Iron which they had hazardou&s;ly and painfully &s;av'd, and brought up; as al&s;o every Piece of Board, or any thing el&s;e; which was all of Service to me, as in the Sequel of this Story you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>Our Manner of Fi&s;hing was thus: We u&s;ed to go from Town before Day, &s;o as to get down to the Sea-&s;ide before the Sun was very high, to avoid his &s;corching Heat in our Journey down the Rocks, and took with us a Calaba&s;h or two of Water, according as our Company was, more or le&s;s, al&s;o &s;ome Pompion, Banana's, &amp;c. for Food. Our fi&s;hing Uten&s;ils were long Canes for fi&s;hing Rods, and Cotten Lines, which they made and twi&s;ted &s;o well, that I think they exceeded any of our Hemp or Flax Lines made in <HI>England,</HI> both
<PB N="261" REF="270">
for Strength and Durablene&s;s; we made u&s;e of Stones, for want of Lead, to &s;ink our Lines, and did well enough, becau&s;e in mo&s;t Places where we fi&s;h'd on the Rocks, there was little or no Tide run.</P>
<P>Our Hooks, as I hinted before, were made by the old bungling Smith, of old Nails; though I generally made my own Hooks, and al&s;o for the Family, whereof I now was a Member; for I could borrow a Hammer and a File of the old Farrier, as they call'd him, whenever I would, and I think my Hooks far exceeded his; but a bended &s;harp-pointed Nail, without any other Prepara|tion, would have been &s;ufficient; for the Fi&s;h in tho&s;e Parts were &s;o voracious, that if you were not very watchful, and quick, they would &s;wal|low the Hook down into their Belly, which they &s;eldom let them do, endeavouring always to hook them in the Mouth, to prevent their cutting their Lines with their Teeth, as almo&s;t all the Fi&s;h there|abouts have large and &s;harp Teeth, rather like ravenous Land Animals, than our Fi&s;h on the Coa&s;t of <HI>England;</HI> and when at any Time they hale a Fi&s;h up that hath &s;wallow'd the Hook, if it &s;hould chance to cut the Line and e&s;cape, they would blame the Fi&s;herman, and impute it to his want of Skill, or Carele&s;sne&s;s, or both.</P>
<P>Our Bait was generally Crabs, which they were very dexterous at catching; and when we could not catch Crabs, we us'd to take Limpits, or any other Shell-Fi&s;h we could get upon the Rocks; and when we had caught a Fi&s;h, we generally made Bait of that; though Crabs was the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Bait we could u&s;e.</P>
<P>They always brought Wood down with them for Firing, which they gather'd as they went along, to boil our Fi&s;h, and roa&s;t our Pompion, &amp;c. with, and u&s;ed to be out &s;ometimes three,
<PB N="262" REF="271">
four, five, or &s;ix Days, according as we caught Fi&s;h, or our Inclinations led us.</P>
<P>They gather'd Salt on the Rocks, which was made by the Heat of the Sun, of the Sea-Water, lying in the Holes of the Rocks, being either ca&s;t up in the Hollows of the Rocks by the Spray of the Sea beating up again&s;t them when it blew; or when it was a clear Sun-&s;hine Day, at high Water the Sea would fill &s;ome Hollows of the Rocks; and after the Sea was fallen, before it came up again, it would all, if the Hole was &s;hallow, be a dry Salt; but if deep, then the Salt would lie at the Bottom; or, if too deep, tho&s;e Hollows that the Sea flow'd up to, could not, in &s;o &s;hort Time, kern any Salt; but tho&s;e Hollows or Holes which were above the flowing of the Sea, and fill'd with Water, I have known it all converted to Salt, or rather all the Water ex|hal'd by the Sun, and only the Salt left in the Hole; and have ob&s;erv'd it two Foot thick of Salt, and to the Quantity of about&punc; four Bu&s;hels, or more, in a Hole which did not exceed five or &s;ix Yards &s;quare.</P>
<P>I am apt to think, that there is a certain Qua|lity in &s;ome Rocks that helps, and in others, that hinders the Salt's kerning; for in &s;ome I have &s;een Water that has &s;tood &s;o long, that it has been all vapour'd away, leaving behind only a Sediment as muddy Water does, but very &s;alt, and &s;ometimes a thin Cru&s;t lying on the Sediment, &s;omething re&s;embling the Cru&s;t, or Cream that lies on the Top of the Water, when you wa&s;h or purify Tartar, and commonly call'd <HI>Cream of Tartar,</HI> but extreme &s;alt and &s;trong, even to a Coro&s;ivene&s;s; whereas other Rocks &s;hall yield one third or one fourth Part of Salt, in Proportion to the Quantity of Water contain'd in tho&s;e Hollows.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="272">
The Natives us'd to get their Salt in a Readi|ne&s;s fir&s;t, as much as they thought &s;ufficient for that Day's U&s;e, and then all Hands went to fi&s;h|ing; and in the Evening they us'd to gut, &s;plit, and &s;alt what they caught, and let them lie in the Salt in Heaps all Night; and in the Morning, after the Sun was up, they &s;pread them in the Sun to dry, turning them as occa&s;ion requir'd; and when they were hungry, they dre&s;s'd &s;ome Fi&s;h and Pompion, which we never wanted whenever I happen'd to be with them; but if not, they very &s;eldom carry'd any, contenting them&s;elves with a little boil'd or broil'd Fi&s;h while abroad, and that &s;eldom oftner than once, towards Night, after they had done fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>At tho&s;e Fi&s;hing-places which were ea&s;y of Ac|ce&s;s, and often frequented by them, they u&s;ed to leave an Earthen Pot, which was free for any to u&s;e who came a fi&s;hing, and that for the Sake of the Fi&s;h-Broth, which they e&s;teem much beyond any Broth made of Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>At Night they repo&s;e them&s;elves in the Hollow of the Rocks; being always careful not to lie expos'd to the falling of the Night-Dew; and they would gather dry Gra&s;s, &amp;c. and bring it down to lie on.</P>
<P>When we had caught Fi&s;h enough, or was tir'd of our Sport, and had a Mind to go to Town, they would &s;end one up for an A&s;s, to come as far as it could, and the re&s;t would bring the Fi&s;h up at their Backs to the Place where the A&s;s was, which they loaded with it up to Town; and they would always oblige me to ride down as far as the Bea&s;t could go, which was al&s;o brought for me to ride on up again, with the A&s;s that was to carry the Fi&s;h up.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="273">
When we were come up with our Fi&s;h, they us'd to &s;end to their Friends and Relations &s;uch a Quantity as they thought fit, who us'd to do the &s;ame to them again: And this was our Manner of fi&s;hing at the I&s;land of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>One Thing I forgot to ob&s;erve, that we always, each of us, was provided with two Lines, one, which was the &s;maller, we had fix'd to our Fi&s;hing-Rod with a little Hook, for catching the le&s;&s;er Fi&s;h, and had our large Lines and Hooks ready by us, when we &s;aw a large Fi&s;h, which we fear'd would be too heavy for our &s;mall Hooks and Fi&s;h|ing-Canes; and &s;ometimes, when Fi&s;h did not bite, they would &s;wim away to a more convenient Place, when they could not otherwi&s;e get along for the Smoothne&s;s and Steepne&s;s of the Rocks, and &s;wim back again with a much larger Quantity of Fi&s;h, than they could carry on the dry Land, or be able to hale out of the Water without Help.</P>
<P>As to their Hunting, the Privilege of killing the wild Goats is intirely the Governor's, without who&s;e Leave, no one dare hunt; and this was a Law made by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> when they fir&s;t peo|pled the&s;e I&s;lands, and put a Breed of Cattle on them, to prevent the Breed from being utterly de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>This is the principal Privilege or Advantage the Governor hath; who al&s;o commands the Peace, and decides the little Differences which &s;ometimes happens among them, and can, upon their not &s;ubmitting to his Deci&s;ion, confine them till they do, in an open Place, wall'd round like the Pounds which are in &s;ome Parts of <HI>England</HI> for impri&s;on|ing Cattle, when they are caught tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on their Neighbours Ground; but in&s;tead of a Gate, they generally lay only a Stick a-cro&s;s, and tho&s;e innocent Criminals will &s;tay there, without at|tempting
<PB N="265" REF="274">
to go out, as if they had been in the &s;ecure&s;t Pri&s;on in the World; except when &s;ome of the highe&s;t &s;pirited among&s;t them, happening to be overcome with Pa&s;&s;ion, and in&s;pir'd with Revenge again&s;t tho&s;e that have offended them, fly out in their Rage; who, however, as &s;oon as caught again, are, by the Governor's Order, ty'd Hand and Foot, and a Centinel is &s;et to watch them, and prevent their e&s;caping again, till they agree with their Antagoni&s;t, ask the Governor's Pardon for going out of Pri&s;on without being clear'd, and remain in Pri&s;on &s;uch a Space of Time, as the Governor thinks his Crime hath de|&s;erv'd; which is the utmo&s;t Puni&s;hment the Go|vernor hath Power to inflict: Nay, if one kills another, which hardly happens in an Age, all the Governor can do, is to confine him till he pacifies the Relations of the Deceas'd by the Mediation of his Friends, who are bound for the Criminal's Appearance, when a Judge comes authoriz'd from <HI>Portugal</HI> to do Ju&s;tice: Which never has been yet, as far as I could learn from the Natives.</P>
<P>Sometimes when it is a &s;mall Crime, e&s;pecially if it be a &s;enior Per&s;on, the Governor confines him only in his own, or &s;ome other Hou&s;e; and this is reckon'd a great Favour; for to be impri|&s;on'd, is accounted &s;uch a great Scandal among them, that <HI>Tyburn</HI> it&s;elf is hardly &s;o much dreaded by our Criminals in <HI>England,</HI> as tho&s;e open Pri|&s;ons are by them. But to proceed: When the Governor has a mind to make a general Hunt, all the I&s;landers are &s;ummon'd, and all the Hunting-Dogs are call'd. The&s;e are between a Beagle and a Greyhound, not unlike the Mungrel Greyhounds we have in <HI>England,</HI> but &s;horter legg'd, and clum|&s;ier, with large Ears hanging down.</P>
<P>At Night, or when the Governor thinks fit to leave off hunting, they meet all together, and the
<PB N="266" REF="275">
Governor parts the Veni&s;on among them as he plea&s;es, &s;ending what he judges proper to his own Hou&s;e, with all the Skins; and after he comes home, he &s;ends a Piece to one, and a Piece to another, of tho&s;e that are old, or that were not out a hunting; and the Skins he di&s;tributes among them as he thinks convenient, or as their Nece&s;&s;ity requires, re&s;erving the Remainder of the Skins for the Lord of the Soil.</P>
<P>They have a Report, that the King of <HI>Portu|gal</HI> has lately given their I&s;land to one of the Ladies of his Court: But how they came by this Information I never could tell; however, mo&s;t of the He-Goat Skins were laid by for her, in a Hou&s;e built for that Purpo&s;e, according to their Report, ever &s;ince the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> fir&s;t brought them hither, and which is call'd by them <HI>Ca&s;a de Fazendo, (i. e.</HI> a Warehou&s;e). And here they have lain &s;o long, that many of them, as I ob&s;erv'd, were almo&s;t reduc'd to Du&s;t.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Governor hunts for his private Diver&s;ion, and then he &s;ends only to &s;uch a Num|ber, as he thinks fit, to accompany him; and &s;ometimes he only &s;ends, and does not go a hunt|ing him&s;elf; and then, all the Veni&s;on is brought, together with the Skins, to his Hou&s;e, where he di&s;tributes it as he thinks fit; and there is none allow'd to keep Hunting-Dogs but whom he li|cen&s;es, and tho&s;e are call'd <HI>Cau&s;&s;adors,</HI> or Hunt&s;|men.</P>
<P>I made Enquiry from Time to Time when any Ship had touch'd on the I&s;land, and was inform'd, that only two Ships had touch'd there in &s;even Years Time, the one an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who bought &s;ome Hogs of them, and the other a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who anchor'd in a Bay call'd <HI>Ferrier,</HI> and landed his Cask to fill Water, but was blown off, and left his Water-Cask behind him; as al&s;o one Black, a

Native of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who &s;wam from them, and gave an Account, that they had &s;ome more of his Countrymen on Board, whom they were carrying to <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> for Slaves.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> and the re&s;t inform'd me, that <HI>French</HI> Ships often us'd to touch at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and now and then a Ship came to trade there for Mules, and that the <HI>French</HI> frequently us'd to come over in their Boats to buy Fowls and Hogs; but of late Years they had di&s;continu'd that Practice, which made them conclude, either that no Ships had been there trading lately, or that they &s;up|ply'd them&s;elves better at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, than they could at St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon, I would fain have had the Governor to let me mend up his old Boat to go over to St.</HI> Philip<HI>'s, and offer'd to be the Carpenter my&s;elf, and al&s;o to find Nails, which, as I mention'd be|fore, I had a great Quantity of, and likewi&s;e to make her Sails of my Jib, &amp;c. but he would not con&s;ent to it,</HI> For fear, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that I &s;hould come to any Mi&s;chance, by Rea&s;on the Boat was &s;mall, and the Wood very much decay'd and rotten: Be|&s;ides, he had heard, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that the Channel be|tween St. <HI>John</HI>'s and St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, was very turbu|lent, with great Seas, &s;trong Currents, and violent Gales of Wind. <HI>All which was very true; yet I would freely have run the Hazard, if the Gover|nor would have let me mend his Boat; but he &s;till deny'd me for the Rea&s;ons above mention'd; but however told me,</HI> If I under&s;tood how to build a Ve&s;&s;el, I might build one new, large, and &s;trong, there being Wood enough on the I&s;land, and he doubt|ed not but all the Inhabitants likewi&s;e would a&s;&s;i&s;t me, as much as they were capable: And, <HI>continu'd he, Singore Carolos</HI> hath often told us, that he could build any Ve&s;&s;el, if he had Conveniencies: Now you have Nails enough to build a large Ve&s;&s;el,
<PB N="268" REF="277">
I believe, and we have three or four Hatchets among us, and you have an Adz which was &s;av'd, and you need not do any of the laborious Work, but leave that for us, and you, and <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> only do that Part of the Work which our Ingenuity won't reach to. We have Wood enough, and &s;everal of us can handle a Hatchet, &s;o as to cut down Fig-Trees, &s;plit them, and hew Boards out of them, and I will engage to provide you with Boards enough, or what other Sort of Timber you would have; and my Brother, who put up the Bed for me, who, I told you, had been at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> is a good Carpenter, tho' I won't pretend to &s;ay, like your White Carpen|ters; but yet he can work very well, and makes almo&s;t all our Doors on the I&s;land, and has be&s;ides made Stools for the <HI>Padre,</HI> which al&s;o &s;everal others on the I&s;land can do; and the Chair which you have &s;een at the <HI>Padre</HI>'s Hou&s;e, &s;hews that he is a Work|man.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I was afraid I &s;hould not have Nails enough; <HI>(having only &s;ix or &s;even hundred broken and whole, be&s;ides a great many large Spikes, &s;ome Bolts, and other Iron-work, which they had &s;av'd. He &s;aid,</HI> He thought I was the be&s;t Judge in that Ca&s;e; and that if I wanted, I could in&s;truct the old Farrier, who was al&s;o ingenious of him&s;elf, &s;o as to make me &s;ome Nails out of the old Iron. But, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you &s;hall promi&s;e me to make one large enough to carry you over the Channel of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s &s;afely without any Danger, and that cannot be le&s;s than twice the Bigne&s;s, at lea&s;t, of my Boat; therefore, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> you &s;hall not make her le&s;s than twice as long, and twice as broad, and twice, or more, as deep as mine was, that the great Seas, in pa&s;&s;ing over the Channel, may not be able to fill her.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to make a Boat twice the Length, Breadth, and Depth of yours, would be to make
<PB N="269" REF="278">
one a great many Times bigger than your Boat; <HI>but all the Geometry that I was Ma&s;ter of, could not convince him of that.</HI></P>
<P>So at la&s;t we concluded to build; and when we had taken a general Survey of the whole I&s;land, to find what Tools were on it fit for our Occa&s;ion, we mu&s;ter'd up three &s;mall Hatchets, a Thing like a Butcher's Cleaver, two Gimblets, one about the Size fit for a twenty-penny Nail, the other a very large Spike Gimblet, a &s;mall Pin-mall, one Claw Hammer, one like a Cobler's Hammer, and a double-headed Hammer about three Pound Weight, be&s;ides what the Smith had.</P>
<P>So after we had fully concluded upon the Mat|ter, all the Inhabitants were &s;ummon'd to meet before the Governor's Hou&s;e, which accordingly they did, the Governor making a Speech to them, &s;hewing them the Cau&s;e for which they met, and how charitable and good a Work it was to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and withal, how it would redound to their Credit, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>They an&s;wer'd,</HI> That he could not be more ready to ask, than they to grant; and that they were wholly at my Call, when and where I pleas'd, and that I might always command them as my Servants and Slaves. They were very &s;orry, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> to think of my leaving them; but when they con&s;ider'd how mean I liv'd here, both for Food and Raiment, as well as perhaps the Want of other Things which they might be ignorant of, they could not be &s;o unju&s;t as to de&s;ire me to continue in that Mi&s;ery, which they were &s;en&s;ible I underwent while there with them: That they wi&s;h'd their I&s;land yielded tho&s;e Nece&s;&s;a|ries, as well as Plea&s;ures and Delights, which my Country did, and then perhaps they would keep me with them per Force, and think they did not wrong me; but, as it was, they could not in Rea&s;on per|&s;uade me, much le&s;s force me to &s;tay with them.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="279">
<HI>I told them,</HI> I thank'd them kindly, and hoped I &s;hould come back one Time or other, when I had it in my Power to make them &s;ome Retaliation.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They de&s;ir'd none, my good Opinion of them was all they wi&s;h'd for, and for the Continu|ance of that they would do any Thing that was in their Power. <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> That &s;ince they had but three Hatchets, all them that could u&s;e them, would take their Turns Day by Day, that the Hatchets might never be idle, and tho&s;e that could not exerci&s;e the Hatchets, mu&s;t carry down the Boards and Timber, after hew'd and a little dry'd, to the Place where I had a De&s;ign to build the Boat at.</P>
<P>All this was accordingly put in Execution, nei|ther would they let me work at the cutting of the Trees down, or &s;plitting, or hewing them into Boards; but bid me re&s;erve my&s;elf again&s;t I came to build the Boat, to do that Part which they could not.</P>
<P>They had an Ingenuity peculiar to them&s;elves in &s;plitting the Trees after they felled them, which was thus: When they had cut down the Tree to that Length which would &s;erve to work it for a Board, which &s;eldom exceeded 7 or 8 Foot, though &s;ometimes, by Chance, they run 12 or 14 Foot in Length, they would lay the Piece along, and chock it fa&s;t with Stones, that it might not roll, and then they would chop a Channel, or Gutter, as narrow as they could, and deep; after which, they would turn the Piece of Timber, and right oppo&s;ite to the fir&s;t, they would dig in another Gutter with their Hatchets, as deep as they could, the whole Length of the Piece, and then they would get Wedge-like Stones, that were &s;o thick, as to fill up the Breadth of the Gutter, before it touched the Bottom; then tak|ing great Stones, as big as they could lift, and &s;tanding clo&s;e to the Piece of Timber, they would
<PB N="271" REF="280">
throw them down with all their Might, on their Stone Wedges, which they &s;o often repeated, till the Piece &s;plit, which would not be long, pro|vided they made their Gutters deep enough; and they would be &s;ure always to &s;plit as &s;traight as they made their Gutters. After they had &s;plit their Piece of Timber, they would hew away the flat Sides as even as they could, which, for the mo&s;t Part, was pretty tolerable; and then they would hew away the other Side, 'till it was of the Size which I ordered them, which was Two Inches; for they could not be expected to hew them &s;o &s;traight, or even, as a Saw would cut them; nor could I ever get them to hew by a Line; for though, they &s;aid, that might be a Guide to Whites, yet, they never being u&s;ed to it, it rather hindered them, than any ways helped them to cut &s;traight.</P>
<P>After we had got a good Quantity of Boards made, there fell out a lucky Hit to help our De|&s;ign, which was a large Piece of Wreck, drove down clo&s;e along the I&s;land, on the North-We&s;t Side, and by the Current &s;etting round, brought it under the Lee of the I&s;land, and, by good luck, the Sea Breeze &s;etting in, brought it to the Shore near a Place called <HI>Scio,</HI> where &s;ome People were fi&s;hing, who made &s;hift to &s;ecure it, while they &s;ent others to get more Help, and call me, they thinking it had been a whole Ve&s;&s;el, and that I could contrive &s;ome Way to free her, and fit her up to go to my own Country in.</P>
<P>I &s;aw it was only a Piece of a Ship's Quarter, but had no convenient Place to hale it a&s;hore to &s;ecure it there, becau&s;e of the Rocks; wherefore they propo&s;ed to float it down to <HI>Scio,</HI> unle&s;s they met with any convenient Beach to hale it a&s;hore upon before; &s;o they made fa&s;t Lines to it to tow it by, and launching it off clear of the Wa&s;h of
<PB N="272" REF="281">
the Sea, away they &s;wam with it, to the Number of between 30 and 40, and, with great Difficulty, got it into a little Cove, between <HI>Scio</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;|carree Picuana,</HI> where they haled it to the Shore; from whence they &s;ent to inform me of it.</P>
<P>I made all the Ha&s;te to them that I could, and finding we had not Help enough, I &s;ent up to the Governor and Prie&s;t for more, which they procured, and came down them&s;elves; and at the &s;ame Time, I &s;ent for &s;ome Ropes that had been left where I had been Shipwreck'd, with which we haled it up as high as we could, and went to work to break it up as well as we could with Stones, in&s;tead of Malls; and &s;aved all the Nails, Iron-Work, and all the Plank and Timber which we could; and after Two Days working upon it, we got it broke up &s;o as to be able to hale all of it that we thought would be to our Purpo&s;e, clear of the Sea, which afforded us a good Quan|tity of Boards, Timber, Nails, Spikes, Bolts, with all the Mizen Chain Plates, Bolts, with the Mizen Ma&s;t, and &s;tanding Rigging, the which I concluded &s;hould be my Keel, and re&s;olved upon this Cove to be my Building-Place; &s;o after we had &s;ecured all that we could, or thought worth &s;ecuring, we went up to Town, and I would have gone about Building forthwith; but the Governor, and &s;ome others, told me, That I had better let them make me Boards enough before I took the People off from making them; for that they were now fixed at it in &s;everal Gangs, and if I took them off, it might be &s;ome Difficulty to get them to it again; and that be&s;ides, they could not be making Boards, if I began to build, becau&s;e there were not Hatchets enough for us to work at both; be&s;ides, the Wood would be drier and lighter to work, as well as to carry down from the Moun|tains where they cut them, to the Place where I
<PB N="273" REF="282">
de&s;igned to build; and therefore they rightly ad|vi&s;ed, it would be better to let them cut Boards and Timber enough, and rather more than le&s;s, before I began to build.</P>
<P>This Advice was not to be neglected, and in the mean Time, I got all the Ropes, Boards, and my Boom, which yet remained at the Place where I was wrecked, and every thing el&s;e that I thought might be of U&s;e, to my Building-Place, which was a &s;mall League from the Cove where I de&s;igned to begin the Work.</P>
<P>I was not without many Doubts and Fears of my Ability to build this Boat, having never in my Life done any thing of that Kind, nor any thing el&s;e of Carpenters Work, and thought to my&s;elf, if I &s;hould not be able to go through with it, and e&s;pecially now they had taken &s;o much Pains about it, and were all confident of my Ability (though I all along told them, that I never had done any thing of that Kind, and was no Carpenter) yet I was afraid it might occa&s;ion them to le&s;&s;en their E&s;teem of me, and, perhaps, &s;light me; but then I thought to my&s;elf on the other Hand, that no Man was born a Carpenter; that it was Nece&s;&s;ity which put Mankind on many Inventions at fir&s;t; and that I had a better Foundation to go upon, than any of tho&s;e could have, that fir&s;t &s;et about it, having &s;een a Ve&s;&s;el begun, and built from the Keel: All the&s;e Con&s;i|derations, I &s;ay, encouraged me to proceed; and &s;ince I had gone thus far, I thought my&s;elf oblig'd to u&s;e my utmo&s;t Skill to compleat it.</P>
<P>After all was done ready for going to Work, I acquainted the Governor, &amp;c. with my Re&s;olution to begin, who wi&s;hed me Succe&s;s; and he, and my Landlord, a&s;&s;ured me, that I &s;hould be con|&s;tantly &s;upplied with Provi&s;ions, &amp;c. which was faithfully performed; and &s;o I went down with
<PB N="274" REF="283">
Six or Eight of the be&s;t Carpenters the I&s;land afforded, accompanied with others, who employ'd their Time in bringing, carrying, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in what they could, and going daily, &s;ome of them, to the adjacent Rocks to fi&s;h for us that were at Work; for they had all, both Carpenters and others, brought down their Fi&s;hing-Geer with them; and every Day we had &s;ome that came from Town with Pompion, &amp;c. who would &s;tay, and let the others go up that had a Mind; &s;o that we had always Hands enough down (be&s;ides the <HI>Singores Carpentaras)</HI> to do all the drudging Work, as carrying, lifting, and holding, as well as to catch us as much Fi&s;h as we could eat.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor came down the Day after me, and brought a Line with him, which was about Twenty Foot long, it being the Length of his Boat, and told me,</HI> That he under&s;tood by <HI>Sin|gore Carolos,</HI> that I de&s;igned to make my Boat but little (if any thing) bigger than his; which, if I did not, he would forbid all the People to a&s;&s;i&s;t me any farther; for that he, and <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> too, were of Opinion, That I &s;hould only ca&s;t my&s;elf away, through my Earne&s;tne&s;s to get off the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I thanked him for his Care, but would have him believe, I knew what was fit to venture in, as well as <HI>Singore Carolos:</HI> And if <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> is &s;uch an under&s;tanding Man, <HI>&s;aid I, with a little Warmth,</HI> why does not he come down, that I might have his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to advi&s;e and con|trive how it &s;hould be?</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Singore <HI>Carolos</HI> was not well, and was very &s;orry that he was not able to come; but was in a great Fear that I would make the Boat &s;o &s;mall, the &s;ooner to get fini&s;hed, and get off the I&s;land, that I &s;hould drown my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284">
<HI>I told him,</HI> I would engage to make her big enough to go almo&s;t any where in her.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Then I mu&s;t make her many Times big|ger than his Boat; but let me make her as big as I would, he would engage me Boards, Timber, and Help enough.</P>
<P><HI>I thanked him, and asked him,</HI> How big he would have me make her?</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> At lea&s;t Twice as big as his own Boat.</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>I did de&s;ign to do that;</HI> and he de|&s;ired me to &s;hew him how long I de&s;igned to make the Keel, I mea&s;ured off Thirty Foot, though not de&s;igning her nigh that Length, only to &s;atisfy him; and he mea&s;ured with his Line, and finding it Ten Foot more than the Length of his Boat, he &s;aid, <HI>That would carry but Half as much more than that.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The Way that I &s;hould build her, &s;he would, at that Length, carry Four Times as much as his Boat; <HI>but he would not believe me: Whereupon, I &s;aid,</HI> That if, after the Boat was built, &s;he did not carry above twice as much as his, I would give her to him, and tarry upon the I&s;land till a Ship came.</P>
<P>Well, then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I will take you at your Word; if &s;he does not carry as much more as my Boat, without the Keel being any longer than the Length of this Line and Half, you are to &s;tay with us till a Ship comes.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> it's a Bargain.</P>
<P>So he borrowed a Line from one that was by, and mea&s;ured the Length, and Half Length of it, and cut it off, and gave it to his Brother, who was one of my Carpenters, and bid him be &s;ure <HI>not to let me make it a bit &s;horter; for he would not have me to take &s;o much Pains, and the Ve&s;&s;el not to be fit to venture in at la&s;t.</HI></P>

<P><HI>I de&s;ired them</HI> not to take any Notice to the Go|vernor, but that &s;he was as big as he would have her, till &s;he was fini&s;hed: Which, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> they would not.</P>
<P>I went on with my Work, but was at a &s;ad Lo&s;s for a Saw, which &s;ome of them hearing me talk of, &s;aid, There was an old Saw on the I&s;land, but they thought it would not cut; I de&s;ired them to get it for me, and it might be that I could &s;harpen it; they &s;aid, they would; &s;o I bid them to borrow al&s;o, one of the Smith's Files, and bring it down with the Saw; which they accord|ingly did the next Day.</P>
<P>The Saw was very old, but it was not alto|gether &s;o much eaten with Ru&s;t, as one might have expected it to be, having been kept dry: and
<PB N="277" REF="286">
in tho&s;e hot Countries, if Iron be kept from the Dew and Dampne&s;s of the Sea, it will la&s;t a long Time before it decays with Ru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;harpened it with the File, and &s;et it as well as I could, &s;o that I made it cut tolerably well, which they all much admired at, &s;aying,</HI> That none of the People on the I&s;land, could find the Way to make the Saw &s;harp; and that they believed, it exceeded the Ingenuity of <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> though he was very ingenious, and, till I came among them, they thought no-body could go beyond him; but they &s;aw, <HI>as they &s;aid,</HI> I could far out-&s;trip him, as he out-&s;tripped them.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> was an inge|nious Man, and, as I might do &s;ome Things better than he, &s;o I did not doubt, but he could do a great many Things better than I.</P>
<P>No, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> they would not believe but I could do every thing better than <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>I believe I had nigh half fini&s;hed, before Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>came down to me, and he had been ailing all the Time. He told me,</HI> That if he had been well, to have been with me at the Beginning to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me, it would, he believed, have been &s;omething more forward; but that the People were &s;o unwilling that I &s;hould go from them, that they &s;eem'd &s;ome of them to &s;ay, That he was partly the Advi&s;er and Contriver of my making this Boat; And &s;ome of them, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> owe me an Ill Will about it; but the le&s;s for my not being with you; for that other-&s;ome believe it to be wholly your own Contrivance.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> When I went up to Town, I would clear him of all that, and thought, if it was &s;o, that he had better go up to Town again, to avoid their cau&s;ele&s;s Su&s;picion.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="287">
<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Now he was come down, he would &s;tay and a&s;&s;i&s;t me Two or Three Days.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I &s;hould be very glad of his Company, provided it would not be prejudicial to him.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> For a Day or Two, it could not, and his Time among them would not be long; for he had determined, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> to go with me in the Boat.</P>
<P>And, indeed, he had given me this A&s;&s;urance before, which was one great Rea&s;on of my build|ing her; for to have a Boat without Hands, would have been the &s;ame, in effect, as to have no Boat at all.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on al&s;o, who had &s;wum away from the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship when it put into this I&s;land from St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> had promi&s;ed to go with me; and likewi&s;e tho&s;e that came with me from St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Domingo;</HI> and &s;o did &s;everal others, whom I had no great Dependance on, though I had on tho&s;e I have now mentioned.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> lo&s;t much of his Credit by this Trip, which I was &s;orry for, but could not help it; for he, it &s;eems, had oftentimes &s;aid, That he could build, &amp;c. And as for the <HI>Theorick</HI> Part, he might, I believe, under&s;tand it very well, being a Man of a good Genius, as well as a Man of Letters, having had, I believe, good and Gentleman-like Education; but for the Want of the <HI>Practical</HI> Part, he was more awkward than my black Carpenters by far, which they pre&s;ently perceived, and were not a little proud of it, though I did my Endeavour to blind his Defect, as much as I could, by telling them, <HI>That he was feeble, and that his Hand &s;hook, thro' Weak|ne&s;s occa&s;ioned by his Illne&s;s,</HI> which pa&s;&s;ed off well enough.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="288">
By this Time, my black Carpenters were grown &s;o dextrous, that by giving them a Mould with them, they would go up and hew me out Boards to an&s;wer the Winding and Rounding at the Bow, or abaft, and likewi&s;e Timber, and would cut or hew any thing to fit, I thought, better than I could, though they did not think &s;o them&s;elves; but the Witchcraft was, the Lines and Sweeps; for I had made me a Pair of wooden Compa&s;&s;es, which I &s;ometimes u&s;ed; and I never &s;aw any thing &s;o wondered at, as at my &s;etting up the Stem and Stern-Po&s;t, becau&s;e I u&s;ed a Plummet to &s;et them upright.</P>
<P>I made u&s;e of the Wreck Boards which we had &s;aved, along the Body of the Boat, where it did not require much bending or winding; for they were &s;o dry, &s;tuborn, and &s;tiff, that they would &s;ooner break than bend much.</P>
<P>Our Nails began now to dimini&s;h apace, &s;o that having nailed the Ve&s;&s;el indifferently &s;ecure at the Bottom, I was forced to fa&s;ten only the But-Ends, and here and there, where Nece&s;&s;ity required, was obliged only to pin, or trunnel them with our large Spike Gimblet, which, as Ca&s;es then &s;tood, was the be&s;t Shift we could make.</P>
<P>The Length at the Keel, was near Twenty-five Foot; the Length between Stem and Stern-Po&s;t, Thirty Foot; Breadth at the main Beam Ten Foot; Depth about Four Foot Ten Inches; I laid a Half Deck abaft, a little above Eight Foot in Length; a Fore-ca&s;tle from the Stem-aft, &s;omething above Seven Foot; I laid in Four Beams that I double kneed, fa&s;tening the Knees with Spikes; the main Beam had Three Knees at each End, whereof one of them was a &s;tanding Knee; I bolted them with &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t Bolts pointed, and boring the Length of our
<PB N="280" REF="289">
Spike Gimblet, we forced the re&s;t by driving the Bolt red hot.</P>
<P>After we had skinn'd her, there were &s;till Boards enough to deck her; but for want of Nails (which, at the latter End of our Work, grew &s;o &s;carce, that we were forced to make U&s;e of all the broken Points of Nails) I frequently took a Point of a Nail, which was but little more in Length, than the Thickne&s;s of the Plank, and after I had drove it up, I drove a broken Stump of a Nail upon that, till I had drove it half way in the Plank, to take the better Hold of the Timber.</P>
<P>What now concerned me mo&s;t, was how to make her tight: I had &s;ome old &s;pare Ropes, of which I made Oakum; but I found Cotton and Mo&s;s did better: My Method to try how the Caulking held, was in the Evening, after we had left off Work, to heave Water hard again&s;t the Seams within Side, and where I perceived the Water to go through, I caulked it over again.</P>
<P>I fini&s;hed my Ma&s;t, and fixed the Rigging; and the Pieces of the Jibb of my former Sloop made me a Main-Sail, but too narrow by a Breadth and a half; but there was no Help.</P>
<P>My Fore-&s;ail and Jibb, were patched out of the Pieces of the Main-Sail, and of Cotton Cloth, which was given me by the Natives, &s;ome contri|buting one Piece, &s;ome another; &s;ome bigger, &s;ome &s;maller.</P>
<P>My Boom I made of my old Gaff, by &s;carfing a Hand-&s;pike to it.</P>
<P>My Rudder Irons, I made thus; I got Three Eye-Bolts, and with heating, I &s;harpened their Points, and drove them into the Stern Po&s;t, up to the Eyes, which &s;erved in the Room of Braces, or Gudgeons, call them which you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="290">
My Pintles were made of broken Bolts that had lo&s;t their Heads, which I bended thus #, and having pointed one End I drove it into the Rudder, fir&s;t making a Way for it with my Spike-Gimblet, for fear of &s;plitting my Rudder.</P>
<P>Having got every thing in order, and fix'd, I was re&s;olv'd to make a Trial of her, tho' I much feared my Caulking would come out at Sea, hav|ing nothing to bind or &s;ecure it with; and ac|cordingly &s;ent Word up to Town that I was all ready, and de&s;ir'd they would come down, and lend their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to launch the Ve&s;&s;el, which the more Help we had, would receive the le&s;s Damage.</P>
<P>Accordingly they all came down, with the Prie&s;t and Governor, and &s;ome Women.</P>
<P>Two or three Days before, four of the Blacks, with <HI>Nicholan Verd,</HI> went and made fa&s;t a Rope to my Anchor, which lay in the <HI>Salt Point Bay,</HI> and not only that, but haled the Palm out from under &s;ome Rocks that it was hook'd in, and &s;wam it, I believe, a Stone's Ca&s;t, or better, and let it go again when they &s;aw it clear of Rocks: I was forc'd to take their Words for their unhooking it from the Rock, but being on the Tops of the Rocks over-head when they did it, I was an Eye-Witne&s;s of their bringing it up to the Surface of the Water, and floating it away &s;o far; which I was very much &s;urpriz'd at, believing it impo&s;&s;ible for four Times the Number to have &s;u&s;tain'd the Weight of the Anchor, which, be&s;ides the Stock, was two hundred three quarters, and the Stock then being &s;o much Water-&s;oaken, could not weigh much le&s;s than one hundred Weight.</P>
<P>The People, as I &s;aid, being all come down, we launch'd her very well; but &s;he made a prodi|gious Quantity of Water, as much as two Hands could keep free by con&s;tantly baling. I &s;topp'd
<PB N="282" REF="291">
&s;everal Places where it weep'd in; but could &s;ee nothing of a con&s;tant Leak, except under three of the Floor Timber Heads, which I could not come at to &s;top, neither did it &s;eem to me that half the Water that we baled out, could come in at all tho&s;e Places where we di&s;cover'd it to leak; however, I chinch'd it as well as I could; and then I con&s;ulted with Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> which was the be&s;t Way to come round to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> that being the be&s;t Place on the I&s;land to take in Provi&s;ions, and to hale her a&s;hore at, there running, in fine Wea|ther, but little Surf, or Suff as Seamen call it, in that Place; and I propo&s;ing to take up the Anchor in the <HI>Salt Point Bay</HI> in my Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> which I could not do without the Ve&s;&s;el: But withal, it was &s;omething hazardous to attempt that Way, for fear the Ve&s;&s;el would not work, which one might rea&s;onably doubt, con&s;idering the Builders and Tools, as al&s;o the Smallne&s;s of the Sails, which tho' &s;o well cut as to &s;tand tolera|bly well, yet were little more than half enough for the Ve&s;&s;el; and if we &s;hould, by that Way of Proceeding, put off of the I&s;land, it would be in a manner, impo&s;&s;ible to fetch the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and then we &s;hould be expos'd to the wide Ocean, and have a long Run before we could fetch any Land, in a leaky and open Boat, and with very little Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>I had indeed made me a wooden <HI>Hillick,</HI> which I fa&s;ten'd to a Stone, as the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fi&s;hing-Shallops u&s;e, by Means of my Shrouds, which I had &s;av'd, and now &s;pliced together, to the Quan|tity of about 25 Fathoms; but I did not think this &s;ufficient to &s;upply the Place of an Anchor, which made me very de&s;irous to recover that in <HI>Salt Point Bay.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="292">
<HI>Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>advis'd me</HI> not to run &s;uch a Ha|zard on the Account of getting the Anchor; <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> He believ'd I might get one more &s;uitable for my Ve&s;&s;el, and al&s;o with a new Haw&s;er to it, which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had left behind him at <HI>Ferrier,</HI> when he was blown off from the I&s;land, and left his Water Cask behind him.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That would do better, if we could find the Anchor, tho' I &s;uppos'd the Haw&s;er would not be much worth, after it had lain &s;o long in the Water.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> That he was on Board the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship when the Anchor was carry'd out, and that it was but a &s;mall Hatch Anchor, and the Haw&s;er was new, and he was &s;ure it could be found; and that &s;everal of the Blacks, as well as he, knew whereabouts in the Bay it lay: That it had a Buoy to it; but the Buoy Rope was &s;o &s;hort, that it did not reach the Surface of the Water at low Water, but might be &s;een under Water in fine Weather.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon we ask'd &s;ome of the Blacks, who told me,</HI> They had &s;een the Buoy &s;ince I had been on the I&s;land, and did not know but it might be there yet; but whether it was or not, they were &s;ure they could find the Anchor.</P>
<P><HI>The Negro who had &s;wam off from the</HI> Portu|gue&s;e, <HI>told me,</HI> That he was on Board of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> when he drove off: That his great Anchor came home, and the Haw&s;er broke at the Windlace, or &s;omewhere within Board; for, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he could not tell me &s;o clearly, not knowing the proper Terms; but he was &s;ure the Haw&s;er broke within, and that there was a great deal of it left with the Anchor: That when they moor'd with the &s;mall Anchor, it was let go in &s;hallow Water, and the Buoy bore; but when the Gale of Wind came on, that &s;he brought home the great Anchor, the little Anchor came home, and dragg'd into deeper Water; &s;o
<PB N="284" REF="293">
that the Buoy Rope being &s;hort, it did not bear; and when he found that the Ship was driving out to Sea, he jump'd over Board, and &s;wam a&s;hore: And that &s;everal times &s;ince, he had &s;een the Buoy, &amp;c. and was &s;ure he could find the Anchor, unle&s;s it was bury'd in the Sand, tho' there was no Buoy to it.</P>
<P>Hereupon I concluded to go round by the <HI>Fer|rier</HI> to the <HI>Fuurno;</HI> for that Way I run no Hazard of being blown off, by Rea&s;on I always had &s;ome of the I&s;land to Leeward of me; but whether it was my laying open the Danger of being blown off by going the other Way, or how, I can't tell; but Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> found Means to excu&s;e and put off his going with me in the Boat till I got to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> and then too, as you &s;hall hear in the Se|quel of the Story.</P>
<P>I prepar'd every Thing ready, and made four Oars, by &s;carfing two Pieces together in each Oar, for I could not get Pieces long enough without do|ing &s;o; and being a calm Day, we row'd along Shore, and got to <HI>Ferrier</HI> Bay very &s;afe, and with very little Trouble, &s;ave the Labour of Rowing.</P>
<P>This good Succe&s;s, which crown'd our fir&s;t At|tempt, &s;o encourag'd the Blacks, that I believe forty, or more, proffer'd their Service to go with me.</P>
<P>When we had been there a Day or two, find|ing her &s;till continue leaky, I concluded to hale her up, and &s;ent up to Town for Help; who accordingly came, and we got her up, and then we went to work to put in a good deal of Water, to &s;ee where it came out, thereby to di&s;cover all the Leaks.</P>
<P>I found one great Leak, which was a Knot Hole, ju&s;t at the Scarff of the Stem to the Keel, which run as large as a Beer Barrel Tap: I was glad when I &s;aw it, and &s;topp'd that, and the other Leaks; but all my Seams wanted caulking

again; for the Oakum and Cotton hanging out of the Seams, made a comical Sight at a Di&s;tance; and what to do I could not tell: However, I made it all in as well as I could; and intimating to &s;ome of the Blacks, that if I had Tallow to lay on the Seams, it would not only keep the Oakum from wa&s;hing out, but would al&s;o make the Ve&s;&s;el a great deal more tight, they &s;aid, <HI>They were &s;ure, if I ask'd the Governor, he would order a general Hunting Match, and kill a good Quantity of Goats, and &s;ave the Tallow for me.</HI></P>
<P>So I concluded to leave &s;ome Hands with the Boat, to keep her from &s;hrinking by wetting her often in the Day, and as the Water leak'd out, or dry'd up with the Heat of the Sun, to reple|ni&s;h it by putting Water from the Sea into her; which they promis'd they would, and I &s;hew'd them how high I would have it kept, <HI>viz.</HI> to cover the Floor Timber Heads, and &s;o I came up to Town; and as &s;oon as I had acquainted the Governor, he not only promis'd me what I de|&s;ir'd, but &s;eem'd angry becau&s;e I was not &s;o free as to ask it at fir&s;t. I told him, <HI>That I had been &s;o trouble&s;ome to him, and all the</HI> Singores <HI>of the I&s;land, that I would not put them to this till I found the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, and Impo&s;&s;ibility to do without it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This was &s;o far from being a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to him, that he was the more angry, and &s;aid,</HI> That he and all the <HI>Singores</HI> on the I&s;land were at my Service, as well as every Thing that the I&s;land produc'd, and I had &s;o many repeated Proofs of it, &s;ince I had the Misfortune of being plac'd there, that he thought it a great Fault in me to conceal from them any thing that I &s;tood in Need of that the I&s;land afforded.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="295">
Having concluded a general Hunting, they kill'd about 40 Goats; but it being the Time of Year when they yielded but little Tallow, out of them all we did not get, I believe, more than four or five Pounds, and above half that was Skin.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor ask'd me,</HI> If that would do? <HI>I told him,</HI> It mu&s;t, &s;ince we could not get any more; and that the Goats yielded &s;o little, that it was not worth while to kill any more; but would make that do for the wor&s;t Places in the Bottom; and thank'd him for what he had done.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I need not, he hop'd, doubt of my being welcome; <HI>but ask'd me,</HI> If Cows Tallow would not &s;erve in&s;tead of Goats? <HI>I told him,</HI> Every bit as well. <HI>He ask'd me,</HI> Whether Hog's Fat would do? <HI>I told him,</HI> No, it was &s;o &s;oft, that with the Heat of the Sun warming the Water it would wa&s;h off.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He was &s;orry for that, becau&s;e the Hogs now were fat, and he could get enough of their Fat; but was afraid the Cows would yield as little Fat as the Goats; but however, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he would look out one of the fatte&s;t of all his Cows, and kill it, and according as that prov'd, o$ I wanted, he would kill more.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I would go down and u&s;e what I had, and in the mean time, de&s;ir'd him to &s;end me the Fat that the Cow yielded;</HI> which he &s;aid he would: &s;o down I went, taking the Negro who &s;wam from the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> with ano|ther call'd <HI>Fum-fo-roon,</HI> (who al&s;o had been on Board the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but not when he drove to Sea, and had likewi&s;e &s;een the Buoy under Wa|ter, &s;ince I came to the I&s;land) and two or three more.</P>
<P>When I came down, I found that my Blacks, who I gave in Charge to keep the Boat wet, had been very diligent, and I believe had not let her

dry in any Part of her all the Time I was ab&s;ent, in&s;omuch that &s;he rather &s;well'd than &s;hrunk; but however, now I was re&s;olv'd to let her dry, and &s;hrink her Seams, and &s;o caulk her all over anew; for by caulking her &s;o much as I had done, I had improv'd very much in this Art, &s;o that I could now caulk better, and, as the Caulkers term it, make the Oakum not only &s;tand fairer, but al&s;o firmer; and &s;ome of my Black Carpenters were not much behind me, tho' I always try'd their Work after them.</P>
<P>My Divers did not &s;eek for the Anchor the fir&s;t Day, as being weary of their Journey down; but the next Day, to the Number of twelve, they &s;wam off, and I believe might be five or &s;ix Hours in the Water before they found it; and were going to give it over, when <HI>Fum-&s;o-roon</HI> acci|dentally playing with &s;ome of the others, at their u&s;ual Game of Plunging, and &s;triking with their Feet, in Imitation of the <HI>Thre&s;her</HI> and <HI>Grampus</HI>-Fi&s;h, and diving from him that &s;truck at him, he happen'd to &s;trike again&s;t the Buoy, which was about a Fathom under Water, there being &s;o much more Water there than the Length of the Buoy Rope.</P>
<P>He immediately ro&s;e up, and hollow'd out as loud as he could, <HI>The Anchor! the Anchor!</HI> At which they all flock'd about him; and tho&s;e who were with me on the Shore, hearing him, and &s;ee|ing the re&s;t flocking to him, they all jump'd into the Sea, leaving me alone, and went to help them.</P>
<P>The Anchor was bury'd in the Ground, which is thereabouts a tough clammy &s;tiff Ow&s;e, or Clay, cover'd over with &s;oft Ow&s;e and Sand mix'd, and they were a long Time getting it out of the Ground, but at la&s;t did; and then they attempted to get the Haw&s;er, which lay bury'd in the Ow&s;e,

and after abundance of &s;triving, and lowering the Anchor down upon the Ground again, to re&s;t, at la&s;t they brought it to the Shore, which, from the Place they fir&s;t took it up at, wanted, I really be|lieve, very little of a Mile.</P>
<P>I was very glad when I &s;aw the Anchor and Haw&s;er, which had been but very little wore, and was then fre&s;h and good, being a four Inch and half Haw&s;er, and about 45 Fathom long.</P>
<P>Both Anchor and Haw&s;er were very fit for me, both for Size and Length; the Anchor, I believe, weighing about one hundred and a half.</P>
<P><HI>I gave them abundance of Thanks: They &s;aid,</HI> I was heartily welcome, and wi&s;hed they could do more for me, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;ame Evening, the Governor &s;ent me down about four or five Pounds of Tallow, and a Piece of Beef of about twenty Pounds, and acquainted me withal,</HI> That that was all the Tallow the Cow afforded, and was the fatte&s;t he had; but if I thought I &s;hould want any more, and would &s;end him Word, he would &s;end me down a Cow alive the next Day, and the Blacks &s;hould kill and &s;alt it for me, to keep it in the Boat as a Store, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I accepted of his Offer, which I found was the be&s;t Way to ingratiate my&s;elf into his Favour, for you can't affront them wor&s;e than to refu&s;e their Offers; and I made the le&s;s Scruple, becau&s;e I really wanted the Tallow, and the Beef was far from being an unnece&s;&s;ary Pre&s;ent; and accord|ingly I had one of the fatte&s;t Cows he had, &s;ent down, which, in the Cool of the Evening, was kill'd; out of which I had five or &s;ix Pounds of Tallow, and the Beef, which was good &s;pending Meat, we &s;alted, fir&s;t cutting out all the Bones, except the Ribs, the better to keep it from taint|ing, and dry'd it in the Sun.</P>

The Boat being now dry and &s;hrunk enough, I went to work, and caulk'd her as well as I could, and had as many Blacks as I could tru&s;t to help; there being always enow of them down every Day, to catch as much Fi&s;h as we could tell what to do with, and every one that came down always brought &s;omething with him, as Pompion, Water-Melon, Banana's, Ears of Indian Corn, and Cu&s;cu&s;s, which is Indian Corn fir&s;t pounded, and then boil'd over the Steam of fre&s;h Water, till it becomes a Ma&s;s like boil'd Pudding, and then it's cut or broke in Pieces, and dry'd in the Sun, and if well dry'd will keep &s;ome Months; &s;omething re&s;embling a Sort of Bread (but much coar&s;er) made in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea for Seafaring Per|&s;ons, as our Sea Bisket is in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o that lay|ing by what we could not eat, I had a Stock, by the Time the Boat was fit to turn into the Water, that a Man might, if the Ve&s;&s;el would have per|form'd its Part, make &s;hift with for as great a Run as <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>After I had caulk'd all, I got &s;ome A&s;s's Dung; and burn'd it to black A&s;hes, and while it was yet a-fire, I put a Quantity into a wooden Thing like a Mortar, which they have there for pound|ing their Maiz, &amp;c. and on that I put a &s;ufficient Quantity of Tallow, and made one of the Blacks pound it with a wooden Pe&s;tle, till it was well in|corporated, and then it would look as black and &s;hining as Jet, till it &s;tiffen'd by cooling and &s;tand|ing; which again might be made &s;oft as Putty, by beating well in a Mortar.</P>
<P>The Service that this black A&s;hes of A&s;s's Dung did, was this, that after I had laid it on the Seams, and rubb'd it in well with my Fingers by drawing it along the Seam, it would, in a little Time, &s;o harden, that the Sun, for all his Heat there, did not melt it, neither would it wa&s;h off
<PB N="290" REF="299">
again with the Water; be&s;ides another Service, as great as any, it did me, tho' I did not know any thing of it then, which was, that it kept the Fi&s;h from eating it off the Ve&s;&s;el; which I came to find out thus, After we had launch'd the Boat, the Tallow, &s;ome how or other, was rubb'd out of a Seam, a little below the Water's Edge, which, by heeling her, I brought out of the Wa|ter, and put &s;ome clean Tallow in the Seam; but in le&s;s than half a Day, they eat all that unmin|gled Tallow as clean off, as if there never had been any laid there, while they never touch'd that which I had mix'd with the A&s;hes.</P>
<P>After I had as well caulk'd my Frigate as I cou'd, and paid all the Seam's Rents, &amp;c. with Tallow and A&s;s's Dung A&s;hes, which reach'd no higher than the Balla&s;t Mark, I got her launch'd; and after 24 Hours &s;welling in the Water, &s;he was tolerable tight, in&s;omuch, that Morning and Even|ing was &s;ufficient to bale her.</P>
<P>Having balla&s;ted her, and fitted every Thing ready, I waited now only for a moderate light Gale to beat round; and at length I obtain'd my Wi&s;h, and getting every thing on Board, &s;et &s;ail with no le&s;s than &s;ixteen Blacks, and more would fain have accompany'd me; but I was &s;adly puzzled with my raw Mariners, none of them knowing how to bear out the Fore&s;ail, to help her to &s;tay, nor well how to row with a Lee Oar to ca&s;t her about; &s;o that every Time I had a Mind to put about, I was forc'd to veer, which lo&s;t a great deal of Ground; be&s;ides, we were much too light, not having Balla&s;t enough in; &s;o that by the Time the Windward Current was done, we had not got above a League to Windward of <HI>Ferrier,</HI> and were half a League, or &s;omething le&s;s, to Leeward of a little Cove, where I had de&s;ign'd to have &s;topp'd for the next Day's Flood,
<PB N="291" REF="300">
if I could have reach'd it; but perceiving it was in vain to attempt it after the Windward Current was done, I was a little concern'd at it; but yet was not a little proud that I had gain'd thus far, and could make &s;ure of where I came from, with the Plea&s;ure of running back again before the Wind.</P>
<P>They did not perceive our lo&s;ing Ground &s;o &s;oon as I did, and would not be per&s;waded of it, nor of the Di&s;advantage of a Lee Tide; and were very certain, they &s;aid, that I could get to the Cove well enough.</P>
<P>I was willing to humour them, who had &s;o often run the Ri&s;que of their Lives to &s;erve me, knowing that we had Time enough to get into <HI>Ferrier,</HI> and moor before Night, and could run no Hazard of being driven to Leeward of it, before it would be evident to them that we lo&s;t Ground upon the Lee Tide; and therefore I made a Couple of Trips off and on, till they &s;aw them&s;elves that we lo&s;t con&s;iderable every Trip, and then they freely con&s;ented to bear away; which we did, and anchor'd and moor'd where we did before in the <HI>Ferrier.</HI></P>
<P>We were met there by &s;everal Blacks, who had kept on the Hills to &s;ee the Boat work, who &s;aid &s;he went bravely, like a Fowl &s;lying for Swift|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I took in &s;ome more Balla&s;t the next Day, and &s;taid two or three Days; and having a fit Oppor|tunity to my Mind, both for Tide and moderate Weather, I beat up, and my Mariners being &s;ome|thing more handy than at fir&s;t, &s;o that they could help to &s;tay her with a Lee Oar, we got, by the Time that it was high Water, under the Leeward|mo&s;t of the little I&s;lands, where I &s;topp'd till the next Morning; and taking the Advantage of a Windward Tide, I made two or three &s;mall
<PB N="292" REF="301">
Trips under the I&s;lands, till we got a-brea&s;t of the Windward of mo&s;t of them, which I did (the Weather being moderate) more to exerci&s;e and divert my Mariners, than any Nece&s;&s;ity; for the Wind being far Northerly, as it mo&s;tly is there, when it's fine Weather, I could have weather'd the Point of <HI>Ghuylungo,</HI> which is the Weathermo&s;t Point of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, with one Trip.</P>
<P>Having got the Length of the Weathermo&s;t of the little I&s;lands, I bore away afore the Wind for the <HI>Fu&cmbdot;urno,</HI> and arriving there, was welcom'd, with abundance of Joy, by the Blacks, who had all the Day, with inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure and Satis|faction, been on the Rocks, &s;eeing us under Sail from our weighing, till we got in.</P>
<P>I moor'd there; and being now &s;ecure, I went up to Town to take my final Leave, as I then thought, of the Inhabitants, and to thank them for all their Kindne&s;s to me; who all contributed to &s;upply me with Provi&s;ions, &amp;c. for the Voyage, with the &s;ame Good-Nature and Chearfulne&s;s, which I had experienc'd &s;o fully on many Occa|&s;ion, and &s;tor'd me with Pompion, Fe&s;hoon, Maiz, and every Thing el&s;e that the I&s;land afforded, in great Plenty.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;s'd four or five Days among them, I prepar'd for my Voyage to St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, where I was in Hopes to have found an Opportunity of getting a Pa&s;&s;age off, &s;ooner than from St. <HI>John</HI>'s I&s;land; but when I was ready, to my great Sur|prize, Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> would not go with me; and gave me &s;uch Rea&s;ons for his Refu&s;al, as I was forc'd to acquie&s;ce with.</P>
<P>I took my little Boy on Board with me, who, till then, had been up at Town; neither had he been down with me all the Time that I was build|ing the Boat, being too young to do me much Service on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="302">
When he came down, the Blacks ask'd him, <HI>How he lik'd the Boat?</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Boy cry'd, and &s;aid,</HI> He did not like her at all; but knew his Ma&s;ter would have a better when he came home.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd him,</HI> If he would &s;tay with them till his Ma&s;ter came back with a better Ship to fetch him?</P>
<P><HI>To which the Child &s;aid,</HI> If his Ma&s;ter would &s;ay that he would have him &s;tay, and would pro|mi&s;e to fetch him away &s;oon, he would &s;tay, but otherways would not.</P>
<P>The Blacks having told me this, I ask'd the Boy, to try him, <HI>If he had a Mind to live on the I&s;land?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>No, if I would plea&s;e to carry him with me; if not, he mu&s;t &s;tay till &s;ome Ship came.

Why,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>you told the Blacks you was willing to &s;tay if I would let you.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>He only &s;aid &s;o for fear of them.</HI> So I told him, <HI>He &s;hould not &s;tay without he had a Mind:</HI> And having every Thing ready, and my Mariners, which were the two I brought from the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and he that came from St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and &s;wam away from her here, with three more of the I&s;landers, I unmoor'd, and &s;ail'd from the <HI>Fuurno</HI> about two Hours be|fore Day, taking the fir&s;t of the Northern Stream, and cho&s;e the Morning Tide, in order to get cro&s;s the Channel before the Day Gale &s;et in &s;trong, which &s;ometimes, as I hinted before, blows in violent Flaws down the <HI>Ghors;</HI> and that I might get into St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s time enough in the Day to find a Harbour, or convenient Place to anchor at, being my&s;elf a perfect Stranger to that I&s;land; and being able to make no Reliance on <HI>Nicholau Verd,</HI> who was with me, tho' he &s;aid that he was

well acquainted with all the Anchoring-Places, as well as Landing-Places, which on that I&s;land are not many, having been deceiv'd by him before in finding the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> of which he was very po|&s;itive, which was the Occa&s;ion of my being &s;hip|wreck'd on that I&s;land.</P>
<P>We got in to Windward of the <HI>Villa,</HI> and run down till we came to <HI>Fonte de Villa,</HI> which is a &s;andy Bay; but the Wind being pretty far Nor|therly, which is an open Wind there, I would not anchor, altho' my Pilot <HI>Verd</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me that was the Road; but I was re&s;olv'd to run till I could bring the Land to Windward, knowing that if the wor&s;t came, if I could not find a Place to &s;ecure the Boat, I could run her under the Lee of the I&s;land to the Rocks, and &s;ave our Lives; which, had I anchor'd at <HI>Fonte de Villa,</HI> the Surff run &s;o high, that it would be very ha|zardous to effect, e&s;pecially as neither the Boy nor I could &s;wim.</P>
<P>I run down along Shore, and could &s;ee a great Concour&s;e of People on the Tops of the Clifts; and after I doubled the Point of <HI>No&s;&s;a Singora,</HI> I came into &s;moother Water, and much le&s;s Wind, which then blew to Windward, and in the Offing very hard.</P>
<P>This was al&s;o a &s;andy Bay, and the Point broke off both Wind and Sea, yet there run a great Surff on the Shore; however, I haled in, and anchor'd in &s;ix Fathom Water, a little to the Northward of the Church of <HI>No&s;&s;a Singora,</HI> which appears &s;omething like a Barn; the Out&s;ide of the Walls were &s;eemingly as white as if they had been but ju&s;t white-wa&s;h'd, and the Roof was cover'd with red Pantiles, as are al&s;o &s;ome of the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Villa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="304">
As &s;oon as I came to an Anchor, one of my Black Mariners &s;wam a&s;hore, to give an Account who we were; and in about half an Hour after, two Blacks of the I&s;landers &s;wam off, and brought me a Compliment from <HI>&punc;Singore Capiteen Thome Santee,</HI> of a Water-Melon. That <HI>Singore</HI> was right a&s;hore with the Hor&s;e of the I&s;land; for our coming had alarm'd them, and the Governor, who was a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and formerly had been Governor (or, as they call him, Captain <HI>More)</HI> of a Fort or Factory belonging to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> upon their di&s;|covering us bearing towards the I&s;land, order'd all the Inhabitants to arm them&s;elves with &s;uch Weapons as they had, to oppo&s;e me if I had been an Enemy, or come to rob them; they having a &s;trong Aver&s;ion to Pirates, ever &s;ince they were plunder'd by one, as they relate, about thirty Years ago. <HI>Thome Santee</HI> was Commandant of the Hor&s;e, and was order'd by the Governor to march along the Clifts as far as <HI>No&s;&s;a Singora</HI> to defend the Coa&s;t, in Ca&s;e I &s;hould attempt to land, before they were &s;atisfy'd what I was.</P>
<P><HI>The two Men who &s;wam off, told me,</HI> That <HI>Singore Thome</HI> bid them tell me, that if I &s;ail'd down a little lower, there was a little Bay call'd <HI>Laghate,</HI> where I might put the Boat to the Beach, and wade a&s;hore, the Sea being very &s;mooth, and little or no Surff running there on the Shore; and that <HI>Singore Thome</HI> had &s;ent them to go with me, and &s;hew me the Bay.</P>
<P>So we weigh'd, and away we went; and came down to the Bay, which was a little Sandy one, with a little Point of Rocks to Windward, which made it very &s;mooth, the Trade very &s;eldom reaching down &s;o far; it being mo&s;tly calm, ex|cept from about 4 P. M. tho' &s;ometimes &s;ooner, and &s;ometimes later, which then would blow a
<PB N="296" REF="305">
faint Southerly or South-We&s;t Bree&s;e till &s;ix or &s;even at Night, and then fall calm till about one or two in the Morning, and then would blow a light Bree&s;e, or Air of Southerly Wind; tho' none of the&s;e Bree&s;es made any thing the more Swell or Surff on the Shore, which, until I knew, I was afraid it would; for at the fir&s;t coming of the Evening Bree&s;es, the Surface of the Water appears as if there was a &s;trong Gale of Wind coming; and at the fir&s;t is pretty fre&s;h, but comes but like a Puff; for by the Time the Ve&s;&s;el is winded to it, it's over; and then, as I &s;aid before, it continues a faint languid Gale, till it dies or dwindles away at la&s;t to a Calm.</P>
<P>By the Time I had got down and moor'd, which I did by laying my Anchor off, and a Rope fa&s;t to a great Stone a&s;hore, the Southerly Bree&s;e began to come on, which you might di&s;cern by the Change of the Colour of the Surface of the Water, a pretty Space before it came; and then coming &s;o &s;mart at fir&s;t, made me not a little fear|ful of lo&s;ing my Boat, which I was not willing to do, till I knew whether there was any more Hopes of getting off this I&s;land &s;ooner than St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and likewi&s;e how I &s;hould be receiv'd and entertain'd here; for my De&s;ign was, if I &s;aw or heard of no more Likelihood of a Ship coming here, than to the I&s;land of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, and e&s;pecially if I did not find &s;o good Reception and Entertainment, to have return'd back again to the I&s;land of St. <HI>John</HI>'s; which was what I was de&s;ir'd to do, and accordingly promis'd to the Governor, and all the People of the I&s;land of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal of the Blacks came down to this little Bay: They call'd to me, and would fain have had me come a&s;hore; but I told them I would not till the Morning. One or two of them

came off to us, and told me, <HI>That</HI> Singore Cap|tain Thome Santee <HI>expected me up to Town, and they believ'd,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>he had &s;ent the Governor Word &s;o, and waited at</HI> No&s;&s;a Singora <HI>to conduct me to Town.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> What Sort of People the I&s;landers were? <HI>and,</HI> Whether the Road from where we lay to Town was good?</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> The People were very kind to Stran|gers; that I &s;hould have the Cover&s;ation of <HI>Bran|ca's,</HI> as I was, &amp;c. and that the Road to Town was indifferent to pa&s;s at low Water, but a little dange|rous in one Place, becau&s;e of the Stones tumbling down; but at high Water there was no pa&s;&s;ing, by Rea&s;on that the Rocks were &s;o &s;teep.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd,</HI> How it came that they were not afraid to come along?</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> That they took their Chance; and that it was but &s;eldom the Stones tumbled down, except in the rainy Sea&s;ons. <HI>They would fain have per&s;uaded me to go a&s;hore, and lie there the Night, where they &s;aid they had a good Fire and Victuals; but I told them,</HI> I would &s;tay on Board to &s;ee how it would be, and was afraid of the Wind which blew almo&s;t right on the Shore, and hoped it would not blow &s;o hard to rai&s;e the Sea, or put the Boat a&s;hore.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, <HI>I need not fear that now, for that the&s;e Winds never held long;</HI> and gave me a De|&s;cription of them, as I have above related, as nigh as they could.</P>
<P>Next Morning I went a&s;hore, and while I wait|ed for their roa&s;ting &s;ome Pompion, &amp;c. for my Breakfa&s;t, came Captain <HI>Thome Santee,</HI> accompa|ny'd with &s;ome others of the <HI>Grand Singores</HI> of the I&s;land, and among them the <HI>Scrivan</HI> of the <HI>Singore Capiteen More,</HI> in order to compliment me from his Ma&s;ter, with the Offer of his Hou&s;e, and

<P><HI>I thank'd him, and waited on him fir&s;t when I came to Town, who receiv'd me very civilly, and from thence Captain</HI> Thome <HI>took me to his Hou&s;e; and after that I vi&s;ited &s;ome of the re&s;t of the Grandees of the Town, and at Night lay at Cap|tain</HI> Thome<HI>'s, who told me,</HI> That he was <HI>Pate|roon,</HI> or, <HI>as they al&s;o call'd it, Procurador,</HI> of the I&s;land of St. <HI>John,</HI> but had not been there a long Time: That it was he that made <HI>Leuonei Gon&s;alvo</HI> Governor of St. <HI>John;</HI> and that if I wanted any thing to be done to my Boat, there were two Blacks, Natives of <HI>Senegal,</HI> who were &s;ent by the <HI>French</HI> Factory there to <HI>France,</HI> to learn the Art of Ship|building, and were put a&s;hore here by the Pirates, who had taken them on Board of a <HI>French</HI> Ship that was carrying them from <HI>France</HI> to the Factory.</P>
<P><HI>I de&s;ir'd to &s;ee them, and they were immedi|ately call'd; and, when come, I ask'd them,</HI> What Countrymen they were? <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They were of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and that one was born at <HI>Senegal,</HI> the other near <HI>Gambio-River,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Barrah;</HI> and that from their Childhood they had been brought up at the <HI>French</HI> Factory at <HI>Senegal,</HI> and were &s;ent by them to <HI>France</HI> to learn the Car|penter's Art: That they had been &s;omething above five Years in <HI>France,</HI> at a City call'd <HI>Nants,</HI> and had learned &s;o well in that Time, that they were capable to build a Boat, or &s;mall Sloop, without any body's in&s;tructing or directing them.</P>

<P>Captain <HI>Thome</HI> and I hereupon went to the Governor, and acquainted him with what the <HI>Guinea</HI> Blacks had &s;aid, as al&s;o with Captain <HI>Thome</HI>'s De&s;ign to get the Smith to go, as like|wi&s;e of his own Re&s;olution; which the Governor would fain have per&s;uaded him from, for fear of any unfore&s;een Accident which might happen, &s;o as not to be able to get back; but Captain <HI>Thome</HI> was fixed in his Re&s;olution, and at la&s;t, the Governor con&s;ented.</P>

Next Thing we had to do, was to get Provi|&s;ions on Board for the Voyage, which was done in a plentiful Manner, &s;uch as the I&s;land afforded; there were &s;everal of the I&s;landers came to me to ask Leave to go with me, after they heard Cap|tain <HI>Thome</HI> was going; and, not caring to di&s;o|blige any of them, I turned them over to Cap|tain <HI>Thome,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>That I left all to him;</HI> and likewi&s;e told him, <HI>That it would not be convenient to carry many.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He would have me do as I plea&s;ed, be would not advi&s;e me to carry one, if I did not ap|prove of it.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If any of his, or the Governor's Friends had a Mind to go, not exceeding <HI>10</HI> or <HI>12,</HI> I could carry them without any great Inconvenience.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He had no Friend that he would ask that Favour for, but one, and did not de&s;ign that it &s;hould be <HI>gratis</HI> neither, for he would make me what Retaliation he could, in any thing the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip</HI> afforded, and would al&s;o oblige them in St. <HI>John</HI>'s, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in every thing which that I&s;land afforded, that would be &s;erviceable to me, he being, <HI>as he told me before, Pataroon</HI> or <HI>Procurador</HI> of that I&s;land; and for any-body el&s;e that had a Mind to go, and I thought fit to carry, as I wanted Sails, and that Cotton Cloths would be u&s;eful to me, he would have me make every one that went, pay one or two Cloths for their Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would leave all that to his Ma|nagement</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <HI>He would take it upon him;</HI> which ac|cordingly he did, and when we had got all rea|dy, and on Board, I weighed from <HI>Laghate,</HI> about an Hour, or better, before the Northern Tide was made, and having the Advantage of the Southern Breeze, which la&s;ted us up to the Point of <HI>No&s;&s;a Singore;</HI> which, what with our Sails,

<P><HI>I con&s;ulted my</HI> Guinea <HI>Carpenters, and &s;hewed them what I would have done,</HI> viz.

The St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Smith promi&s;ed to make Nails, and the old Ferrier, whom I often before men|tioned, undertook to make as much Charcoal, as we &s;hould want, and likewi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t the new Smith all he was able.</P>
<P>I told Captain <HI>Thome Santee, That if I haled my Boat up dry, as I mu&s;t, if I did any thing to her, that &s;he would want caulking all over, and con&s;equently Cotton</HI> (though I had &s;aved all the &s;pare Pieces of Rope that I could, and had more than enough to make Oakum &s;ufficient for once caulking; but I thought it be&s;t to keep a Store as long as I could, for fear I might want when I &s;hould not have &s;uch an Opportunity to get it) <HI>and likewi&s;e Tallow to lay on the Seams, or if I had enough, it would do much better to lay it all over her Bottom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He would take care and order <HI>Leuonel Gon&s;alvo</HI> to kill &s;ome wild Goats.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That the wild Goats would not yield any Tallow; and that if the Governor had not killed Two Cows for me, I &s;hould have been forced to go to Sea without Tallow.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> If I had told him any thing of that while he was at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, he would have ordered Three or Four Cows to be killed for me; but, how|ever, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if there be any Cows in St. <HI>John</HI>'s, you &s;hall not want Tallow.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There were Cows enough; Well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> then you &s;hall have Tallow enough.</P>
<P>So Word being &s;ent up for all Hands to come down to hale the Boat up, accordingly they came, and we haled her about her Length above the flowing of a Spring Tide; and then Captain <HI>Thome,</HI> and the re&s;t, went to Town to divert them|&s;elves till the Boat was got ready.</P>

I got for Freight of my Pa&s;&s;engers that I brought from St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, Ten Cotton Cloths, which made me a good Fore-Sail, and repaired my Jibb; of &s;ome that was left, I made a Pair of Trouzers for my&s;elf, and a Jacket and Trouzers for my little Boy. My old Carpenters came and proffered their Service to me to cut Boards, and bring them down, or what other Timber we wanted; which they did, the Country all the Time &s;upplying us with Food daily: be&s;ides, Capt. <HI>Thome</HI> &s;ent down in the <HI>Interim</HI> Two Cows, and promi&s;ed a Third for the Voyage; and if that would not yield Tallow enough, he would order the Governor to kill &s;ome wild Goats.</P>

<P>Every thing being ready, and on Board, we &s;ailed from the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> and arriving at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, I put all a&s;hore that were to go a&s;hore there, and &s;taying Three Days in that I&s;land, I &s;tocked my|&s;elf with Provi&s;ions and Water; after which I &s;ailed, and in about Ten Days Time, I beat up to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and, had I not been acquainted with the Set of the Current, I might have beat till now, before I had got up to it in that Boat; I fetched a Bay at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> called, <HI>Rivero des Bharkas,</HI> where I anchored; but finding that there were no Ships there, and had not been for &s;ome Months, except one <HI>O&s;tend India</HI> Ship, called by the Inhabitants, <HI>Nau India des Imperio;</HI> and find|ing there was a great Scarcity of Salt at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> I concluded to go to the I&s;le of <HI>May</HI> and take in Salt; for I was near half full with Pompion, Maiz, &amp;c. and the St. <HI>Jago</HI> Men told me, <HI>That they under&s;tood, that the I&s;le of</HI> May <HI>was almo&s;t fami&s;hed for the Want of Su&s;tenance, as they had had a Scarcity, more or le&s;s, for above Fifteen or Sixteen Years, depending wholly on the Ships that load Salt there, for Sub&s;i&s;tance.</HI></P>

I recruited my Water, and concluded to go about the North End of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> as being the be&s;t Way to gain the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> though I do not que&s;tion, but 'tis the Opinion of many, that they can &s;ooner beat up the other Way; but I a&s;&s;ure them, when they have experienc'd it, they will be of my Opinion.</P>
<P>We had a good Parcel of Mandyokes given to us by the Country People at <HI>Rivero des Bharcos,</HI> where I lay Two Nights, and then weighed and anchored in the Bay of <HI>Rivero de Prata,</HI> and &s;topp'd during a Lee Tide there, and the next windward Tide, we got to <HI>Porto Terra-fall,</HI> where I lay Thir|teen Days, the Wind blowing &s;o &s;trong, that I was afraid to venture my Sails; for I found my Boat was more able to encounter the Sea, than my Sails were the Wind.</P>
<P>Fine Weather pre&s;enting, I weighed from <HI>Terra-fall</HI> with a windward Tide, and beat that Tide to windward of <HI>Porto Facienda</HI> about Half a League; but finding when the Lee Tide was made, that I lo&s;t Ground, and not &s;eeing, or knowing any &s;ecure Place to anchor at, that I could fetch, I bore away for <HI>Porto Facienda,</HI> where I anchored that Night.</P>
<P>Next Day Tide, I weighed, but could not get about the I&s;land that Tide; neither could I find any Place to venture to anchor at, to &s;top the Tide; and being loth to bear down to <HI>Porto Faci|enda,</HI> I re&s;olved to keep the Sea all Night, which I did, my Mariners being become very expert.</P>
<P>Next Morning the Lee Tides had hurried me far to Leeward, and it blowing fre&s;h all Night, made a chopping Sea &s;et about the North Point of the I&s;land, in&s;omuch, that I could not fetch <HI>Porto Facienda,</HI> from whence I came the Day before, and it was as much as ever I could do

to fetch <HI>Terra-fall</HI> Road, where I lay Two or Three Days, and fine Weather pre&s;enting, I weighed, and &s;topped again the Lee Tide at <HI>Porto Facienda,</HI> and the next Morning Tide, I beat the Tide an End; but was &s;adly puzzled then, to find a Place to &s;top the Lee Tide, with|out which, I found it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to get round the I&s;land with my dull-&s;wift Fri|gat.</P>
<P>It was Day-light, and moderate Weather, and I &s;aw a little Bay under my Lee-bow, which &s;eemed to me to be a &s;andy or &s;hingly Beach, into which I re&s;olved to run, as long as I &s;aw any Pro&s;pect of Safety, the Water being clear enough to di&s;cern any thing before it hurt me, and my Boat drawing about Four Foot Water, or a little more; and if the wor&s;t came to the wor&s;t, and it would not do, I could but run off again.</P>
<P>Right again&s;t the Bay, were a great many Rocks, &s;ome larger, &s;ome &s;maller, the large&s;t of them not above a good Stone's Ca&s;t in Length, and mo&s;t of them above Water, extending about Half a League off from the Shore: I run in, and keeping a good Look-out, luffing for one, and bearing away for another; till at la&s;t, I got &s;afe in, though with taking a great deal of Care; for without that, it would have been very dangerous: However, after we were in, it made us Amends for our Trouble in finding it, for there was a &s;afe and plea&s;ant Cove run in behind the Point, about a good Cable's Length wide from which, you could &s;ee no Sea, but was Land-locked for all Winds, and from Five to Three Fathom Water, a Sort of a Sand and Ooze mix'd.</P>
<P>I had not been above an Hour, or thereabouts, at an Anchor, when Two Blacks came down to the Water-&s;ide, and called to us, and asked,

<HI>Where we came from? and what Countrymen we were?</HI></P>

<P>O, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> that was well enough, they had heard of us, how that we had been there, and at <HI>Porto Terra-fall: We told them,</HI> It was &s;o; <HI>and they went away again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In a little Time came down an elderly Man, with Four Slaves armed with Lances, attending him; he very courteou&s;ly asked me to come a&s;hore: I told him,</HI> I was a little bu&s;y as yet, and had not well &s;ecured my Ve&s;&s;el; but would wait on him as &s;oon as I could; <HI>and asked him,</HI> If he plea&s;ed to accept of a Water Melon to refre&s;h him in the mean Time?</P>
<P>He thanked me, and bid me heave it into the Water, and he would &s;end one of his Slaves to bring it a&s;hore; which I did, and Two of the Lance-men &s;wam off and carried it a&s;hore to their Ma&s;ter, who &s;at under the Clift of a Rock in the Shade, for the Sun &s;hone very hot; for though it was a fre&s;h Gale in the Offing, yet in the Cove, we had not a Breath of Wind, &s;ave now and then a light Air would come down thro' the Valley.</P>
<P>The grave Gentleman &s;pread his Cloak, and cut the Water Melon, laying it in as great Order, as if it had been a Per&s;on of Quality's Table &s;et with the greate&s;t Varieties; he called Two of his Attendants to him, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, gave them Orders what they &s;hould do: I could not hear, but I &s;aw the Two Slaves make their Ma&s;ter a very reverent Bow, and went away.</P>
<P>I did not care much for tru&s;ting my&s;elf a&s;hore with him at fir&s;t; for that Part of St. <HI>Jago</HI> con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of Banditti, who frequently fly thither from Ju&s;tice, and &s;ometimes make Incur&s;ions among the more civiliz'd Parts of the I&s;land,

where, if they are catched, they &s;uffer; but if they e&s;cape thither, they are &s;ecure; for no Officer of Ju&s;tice dare follow them there, they a&s;&s;uming a Privilege to them&s;elves to oppo&s;e Ju&s;tice, even in ca&s;e of Murder: But after he &s;o kindly accepted my Pre&s;ent, which, with tho&s;e People, is mo&s;tly e&s;teemed as a Token, or Tye of Friend&s;hip, I ventured a&s;hore.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he &s;aw me coming, he got up and came to meet me, with his Two Attendants who remained with him, armed with their Lances, and one of them with a Cutla&s;h, which I had not ob|&s;erved before; he him&s;elf having no other Arms, that I &s;aw, but a long &s;harp-pointed Knife, the Blade about Two Foot long, with a Bra&s;s ca&s;t Handle, which he wore like a Bayonet.</P>
<P><HI>He received me with Abundance of ceremonious, Formality, and welcomed me a&s;hore, asking &s;eve|ral Que&s;tions, As,</HI> What Country? From whence I came? Whether I was going, &amp;c.? <HI>to all which, I gave him an Account; and he told me, without asking, as is u&s;ual with them (e&s;pecially if they are in any Po&s;t of Credit)</HI> That he was the Ju&s;tice of the&s;e Parts; that all that Land as far as I could &s;ee, was his E&s;tate; that he had large Silver Mines on his Ground, but did not know how to extract the Silver out of the Oar, and was afraid to &s;end to the City for a Silver-Smith, for fear it &s;hould, by that Means, be di&s;covered to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who would not fail, as &s;oon as he came to know it, to &s;end an Army and &s;eize it to his own U&s;e, and, perhaps, might be a Means of making them lo&s;e their Privileges here, which had been pre&s;erved ever &s;ince the I&s;land of St. <HI>Jago</HI> was inhabited: <HI>He &s;aid moreover,</HI> That he would &s;end up one of his Slaves to fetch me &s;ome of the Silver Oar.</P>

<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> It was too late, and was an ugly Way, but one of his Slaves could &s;oon go, and be back again, with &s;ome of it to &s;hew me, and on the mor|row, if I thought fit to go, he would go with me, and I &s;hould have a Hor&s;e to ride on, as far as the Hor&s;e could go.</P>
<P>By this Time the Two Slaves which he had &s;ent away, came back, and brought a large Calaba&s;h of Milk, and a fine young full-grown Goat, and very fat, which he pre&s;ented me with; I received it with Thanks, and told him, <HI>I was &s;orry I had nothing on Board worth pre&s;enting him with, in Re|turn of his Kindne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I had done that already &s;ufficiently; for he took &s;o much Satisfaction in the Honour I did him, by giving him my good Company, that he did not know what he could do to make me a &s;uitable Retaliation: Be&s;ides, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Water Melon which you gave me, I do not take it for &s;uch a &s;light Pre&s;ent as you imagine; for the Seeds I de&s;ign to plant; and though it may not yield better Melons than what I already have, yet, being &s;prung from the Seed of a Melon which came from Abroad, it will always pa&s;s for a Rarity.</P>
<P><HI>I asked him,</HI> If he would be plea&s;ed to accept of a Pompion of the Growth of. St. <HI>John</HI>'s?</P>
<P><HI>He thanked me, and told me,</HI> He would, but would have but one, which would yield him Seed enough.</P>
<P>So I called on Board, and bid them bring one of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s I&s;land Pompions, and another that was brought from St. <HI>John</HI>'s, which they did, and I pre&s;ented them to <HI>Singore Jhui&s;s,</HI> who told

<P>We had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e more, in which he often repeated, how much he was bound to, and e&s;teem'd his unknown (but by hear&s;ay) as well as un&s;een Friend; and I could not but wi&s;h Gratitude were as much us'd among us, who generally forget a good Turn but a few Days ago; and yet the&s;e ignorant (I &s;hould &s;ay innocent) Creatures, are extremely &s;en&s;ible of Favours done, not only to them&s;elves, but to their Ance&s;tors, for Ages pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It being Evening, he aro&s;e to go; and ask'd me, <HI>What Time I thought I &s;hould &s;ail to Mor|row?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> In the Morning, a little after Sun|ri&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> That if I went &s;o &s;oon, he could not tell whether he could be down &s;o early; but if not, he would &s;end a Slave down with a Goat to me, and &s;ome Milk; and if he &s;hould not &s;ee me before
<PB N="314" REF="323">
I went, he wi&s;h'd me a good Voyage, and hoped when I came back again he &s;hould &s;ee me.</P>
<P>So taking our Leave one of another, away went <HI>Singore Jorge</HI> to his Hou&s;e, and I on Board, where I &s;lept without Di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>In the Morning betimes came down two Slaves with a Goat, and two Calaba&s;hes of Milk for me; and told me, <HI>That their Ma&s;ter would go up on a Hill, where he could &s;ee me under Sail.</HI></P>
<P>I would have &s;ent a Water-Melon, and a <HI>Fogo|fogo</HI> to old <HI>Singore Jorge</HI> the <HI>Jhui&s;s;</HI> but the Black Slaves &s;aid their Ma&s;ter order'd them not to take any thing.</P>
<P><HI>The Day being a fine Day, I weigh'd, and &s;ail'd from this Bay, which, for want of another Name, I call'd</HI> Porto Jorge; <HI>for I had ask'd the old Gentleman,</HI> What they call'd this Road? And <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> That he never had &s;een, nor heard of any Ve&s;&s;els being in it before; and thought that the Rocks which lay off in the Sea, made it dangerous to come in, and no Ve&s;&s;el ever being in it afore, he believ'd was the Rea&s;on it never had a Name.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> With his Leave I would give it a Name.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> If I would, he would endeavour it &s;hould always go by that Name.</P>
<P>So I gave it the Name of <HI>Porto Singore Jorge;</HI> and I believe it goes by that Name &s;till.</P>
<P>I got about the <HI>Bighude,</HI> which is the North-Ea&s;t Point of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> about Noon; the Wind was North-Ea&s;t, light Gales; and about two or three in the Evening I &s;aw the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and <HI>Monte Pino&s;a</HI> bore South-Ea&s;t-by-Ea&s;t; but the Lee Tide &s;et us away to the South|ward apace: We fetch'd in, as nigh as I could gue&s;s, about the <HI>Calyete;</HI> but it being Night (or rather Morning, for it was between one and two when I got &s;o clo&s;e in, as to be oblig'd to tack off)
<PB N="315" REF="324">
and but a difficult Place to go in at, I dar'd not venture in in the Night; &s;o I ply'd all Night; but, by the Time Day broke out, I was got about midway between the <HI>Calyete</HI> and the <HI>Porto Engle&s;e,</HI> which is the Road us'd by our Ships which go there to load Salt; for which Rea&s;on it is &s;o call'd; tho' the Inhabitants have another Name among them&s;elves, <HI>viz. Yingdo&s;s,</HI> and only call it <HI>Porto Engle&s;e</HI> when they &s;peak to <HI>Euro|peans.</HI></P>
<P>Finding it would be very tedious to beat up again, becau&s;e the Flood Tide runs nothing at all there; but the Ebb, which is the Lee Tide, &s;ets &s;trong, I bore away for <HI>Yingdo&s;s,</HI> and anchor'd there in four Fathom, in the Middle of the Bay: But no Ships being there, and the Surff running &s;o high on the Shore, that we could do nothing at that Place, I was forc'd to weigh, and beat up to <HI>Kalyete</HI> or <HI>Paa&s;eco,</HI> which lies to Windward of <HI>Calyete;</HI> and this co&s;t me two Days; and finding that al&s;o not convenient for landing my Things, and that it was a long Way from the Salt Pans; after I had been to pay my Compliment to Cap|tain <HI>Vicente Alba vel Alva,</HI> who was come down to &s;ee me, I return'd on Board, weigh'd, and run down to the <HI>Calyete,</HI> and there anchor'd, and di&s;|pos'd of my Things, and had Salt brought to me there by the Natives, for which I paid with &s;ome of my Cargo that I had brought from St. <HI>John</HI>'s and St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I cannot tell ju&s;tly who was the Author, but a Notion my Mariners all had, that I took in this Salt, to carry it, and them, to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where they mu&s;t be Slaves during their Lives, gave me a great deal of Perplexity at this Place: Neither was it in my Power to convince them of the con|trary, and accordingly they all to a Man left me, and went a&s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325">
And now I was in a &s;curvy Condition; I had barter'd away almo&s;t all my Provi&s;ions for Salt; there raged a &s;evere Famine at this I&s;land, in&s;o|much, that &s;ome of the Inhabitants were ready to be fami&s;h'd; and I could not expect, if it had been in their Power, that they would treat me as I was us'd at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, or St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s; and yet I had not Help enough to get my Anchor up, or venture to run for St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which then was very plentiful and fertile, tho' before, for three Years pa&s;t, they had &s;uffer'd a &s;ore Famine al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>At length two Blacks came and offer'd their Service to go with me; one was a Native of St.</HI> Nicholas, <HI>and told me,</HI> That he came from thence about ten Months before in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship; but the Captain not proving &s;o kind to him as he expected, he left him at this I&s;land, where he had been about eight Months, and was almo&s;t &s;tarv'd &s;ince he came here; and if I would take him, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he would never leave me.</P>
<P>Upon which I took him, being as glad of him, as he was of my Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The other was a Native of St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> who al&s;o engag'd to go with me.</P>
<P><HI>The St.</HI> Anthonio <HI>Man told me,</HI> That I &s;hould make a better Hand if I went to St. <HI>Anthonio</HI> with my Salt; and to go from thence to the I&s;le of <HI>Sal,</HI> and take a Gang from St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> to kill Turtle there, and &s;ell them at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which &s;till was very &s;carce of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, <HI>How long he had been from St.</HI> An|thonio? He told me, <HI>About eight Months;</HI> &s;o I concluded to take his Advice, if the Wind fa|vour'd, to fetch the&s;e I&s;lands; if not, I could but go to St. <HI>Jago</HI> at la&s;t, which I &s;hould always have under my Lee.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="326">
So we &s;ail'd from <HI>Calyete</HI> in the Evening, and &s;tretch'd to the Northward all Night, the Wind holding pretty much to the Northward, as North-Ea&s;t-by-North, and North-North-Ea&s;t, with light Winds, and a head Sea; &s;o that when the Day broke out, the Northermo&s;t Point of St. <HI>Jago</HI> bore about We&s;t-North-We&s;t, about the Di&s;tance of five or &s;ix Leagues.</P>
<P>The light Winds &s;till continuing, in which my Boat would do nothing with her &s;mall Sails, I was afraid of being &s;agg'd down &s;o to Leeward, that I could not fetch either St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> or St. <HI>Antho|nio,</HI> wherefore I was re&s;olv'd to bear away to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which I did, and run for the North-Ea&s;t Point; and finding a large fair Bay, about two Leagues or &s;omething more to the Southward of the <HI>Bickude,</HI> which, for want of another Name, (there being no Inhabitants thereabouts to know, nor could I find from any others by what Name they call'd it) I call'd <HI>Porto &s;ine Noma,</HI> or <HI>the namele&s;s Road:</HI> I run in there, and anchor'd on the Northern or Weather Side of the Bay; for tho' it was a fair, large, and &s;eem'd to be a clean Bay, with a large Beach or Strand of &s;mall pebble Stones, which mo&s;t commonly denotes clean Ground, yet the Land was &s;o high, that it made an eddy Wind blow right into the Bay; and tho' I had not &s;hot in half Way to the Bot|tom of the Bay, yet I found the eddy Winds blew right in on the Shore, and the Sun being pa&s;t the Meridian, the Gale fre&s;hen'd on the Coa&s;t, and the Eddy, or counter Winds blew in the Bay proportionable in Strength: And being got &s;o far in, that I could not weather the Southermo&s;t Point that made the Bay, I re&s;olv'd to anchor in the fir&s;t convenient Place I could under the High Land, on the North Side of the Bay, and wait for the Land Breeze in the Night, which is com|mon,
<PB N="318" REF="327">
or if Calm, to row out; and finding a lit|tle &s;andy Cove, I run for it, with an ea&s;y Sail, having lower'd down my Main&s;ail and Fore&s;ail, that by running &s;lowly along, I might the better view, and find a convenient Place; and &s;ounding with a Stone &s;lung to a fi&s;hing Line, I found it was pretty &s;teep, and was within a Stone's-Ca&s;t of the Strand of the little Cove before I had Ground.</P>
<P>I let go my Anchor about the Middle of the Cove, and the Wind not blowing right in, but &s;lanting along down to the Bottom of the great Bay, the Ve&s;&s;el tailed towards the We&s;termo&s;t Point of the Rock that made the Cove; and after I had given a &s;ufficient Scope of Cable, and brought up &s;o nigh, that our Stern was about the Boat's Length from the Rock, it was pretty &s;mooth Water, but the Flaws &s;ometimes blew in pretty &s;trong, tho' not &s;o as to fear our Ground-Tackle holding.</P>
<P><HI>The St.</HI> Anthonio-<HI>Man told me,</HI> He did not like the Place, for it was the wilde&s;t Part of that Quarter where the Banditti inhabited.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> They could not hurt us, we having no Bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;hore, and that I was re&s;olv'd in the Night to go; <HI>with which he &s;eem'd to be &s;a|tisfy'd.</HI></P>
<P>They got the Pot on, and went to work to boil &s;ome Pompion and <HI>Sherree,</HI> (which is the large&s;t Part of the Maiz when it's pounded, and when boil'd, &s;omething re&s;embles boil'd Barley) de|&s;igning to make Pap, and I lay down to take a Nap while they got it ready; and had but ju&s;t got a&s;leep, when I was awak'd by Stones hove into the Ve&s;&s;el, whereof &s;ome of them fell on the Quarter Deck, under which I lay. I ask'd, <HI>What was the Matter?</HI> My Folks an&s;wer'd, <HI>They did not know; but a Parcel of Blacks a&s;hore hove</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="328">
<HI>down Stones, and call'd us all the ill Names they could think of.</HI> I put my Head up the Scuttle abaft to &s;ee, and as &s;oon as they e&s;py'd me, &s;lap came &s;everal Stones at me: I dodg'd under the Deck; and as &s;oon as they ceas'd heaving Stones, I look'd up again, and in the St. <HI>Jago Creole</HI> Tongue ask'd them the Rea&s;on of u&s;ing us &s;o roughly? But they fell more furiou&s;ly than at fir&s;t to heav|ing Stones, and &s;ome &s;o large, that I was afraid they would &s;ink the Boat, calling me all the Rogues, Thieves, and Picaroons, &amp;c. that their Malice was capable of expre&s;&s;ing; and asking me, <HI>Whether I had a Mind to carry them away? And if I had there were Slaves enough pre&s;ent for me; and bid me come a&s;hore like a Man-thieving Devil, and they were ready for me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I had no other Remedy, but to &s;hield my&s;elf under the Deck again, till the Gu&s;t of their Fury was over, and they ceas'd to heave Stones; my Companions advi&s;ing me, in their Fright, to cut the Cable, or get up the Anchor, and hurry away out of that dangerous Place, not con&s;idering that we could not &s;tand upon Deck to weigh the An|chor, or to do any thing towards endeavouring to get the Ve&s;&s;el away, either by Sails or Oars; be|&s;ides, the Wind blew right in on the Point of the Rock, and we had &s;o little Room, that the Ve&s;&s;el, if we could or would expo&s;e our&s;elves, would be a&s;hore before &s;he could gather any Way; and the Rocks over us were moreover &s;o high, that the Ve&s;&s;el was, as it were, under them, &s;o that tho&s;e Barbarians could almo&s;t tumble any Stone on Board, that they were capable of lifting.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I dar'd, I look'd up again; I begg'd of them to cea&s;e heaving Stones, and let me but &s;peak to them; but they &s;eem'd to be the more exa&s;perated at me, and one hove a Stone &s;o un|expectedly, as I &s;tood with my Head and from

my Brea&s;t upwards above the Deck, that it had like to have put an End to my Life, for it fell on the Edge of the Scuttle, and there broke to Pieces; Part tumbling down, the re&s;t lying on the half Deck. I dodg'd down, having receiv'd no Hurt, but pretty much &s;car'd; but they tumbled the Stones down &s;o thick, that the half Deck was al|mo&s;t cover'd with them.</P>
<P>The Folks and the Boy &s;helter'd them&s;elves for|ward behind the Ma&s;t, and under the Foreca&s;tle, the little Boy frighten'd almo&s;t out of his Wits; as indeed, &s;o were we all.</P>
<P>Looking from behind the Ma&s;t, after they had ceas'd heaving Stones, to &s;ee whether they were gone or no, one of them hove a great Stone, which &s;truck again&s;t the Ma&s;t, and there &s;hatter'd to &s;mall Pieces; upon which the Boy drop'd down under the Beam, and I thought the poor Child was kill'd, which he would undoubtedly, had the Stone hit him; but he receiv'd no harm, only dropping down, either with the Fright, or to &s;hun the Danger, or both; but he could not tell when I ask'd him afterwards, <HI>What made him &s;ink down?</HI> but &s;aid, <HI>He thought he &s;hould be kill'd; and that they all thought I had been kill'd by the Stone that fell on the Scuttle.</HI></P>
<P>The Quarter-Deck being open, having no Bulk-head, only at the Head of my Cabbin, &s;o that I could &s;ee fore and aft, when I was under the Half-Deck; as &s;oon as that Storm was over, and they ceas'd heaving Stones, I look'd up again; for as &s;oon as they were quiet, I began to fear they would &s;wim off and attempt to board us, which I was re&s;olv'd not to &s;uffer them to do, as long as I had Life or Strength to oppo&s;e them. I no &s;ooner rais'd my Head in Sight, but &s;lam came three or four Stones at me; but I prevented their hurting me by dropping under Deck: Some

of them came down the Scuttle, and one of them glanc'd again&s;t my Ankle, which, tho' I felt no|thing of it then, yet it pain'd me &s;ome time after.</P>
<P>When I found their Fury &s;omething abated, for they ceas'd heaving Stones as &s;oon as I dived out of Sight, I look'd up again, and begg'd of them <HI>but to let me &s;peak to them.</HI> They call'd me all to naught, and &s;aid, <HI>I was the Devil that com|manded the other Devils, and bid me come a&s;hore.</HI></P>
<P>I told them, <HI>I would, if they would fir&s;t let me &s;peak to them.</HI> They told me, <HI>No; I mu&s;t come a&s;hore,</HI> and fell a heaving Stones again; at which I &s;ecur'd my&s;elf again under the Deck.</P>
<P><HI>Then they call'd to me; but I made no An&s;wer: They call'd &s;everal Times; and at la&s;t, they &s;aid,</HI> If I did not come up, they would tumble down Rocks and Stones till they fill'd or &s;unk the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>I look'd up, and &s;aid,</HI> They would neither give me Liberty to &s;peak, or come upon Deck, without running the Hazard of having my Brains knock'd out.</P>

<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I would in a very little Time; but that there was a &s;unken Rock, whereon was not Water enough yet for the Boat to &s;leet over; but that, as the Water was ri&s;ing, I could in a little Time put the Boat to the Rock, and then I would come a&s;hore to them.</P>
<P>This I only &s;aid to amu&s;e them, to have an Opportunity to appea&s;e them; for there was no &s;unken Rock&punc; it being &s;teep too, at the rocky Point of the Cove whereon they &s;tood tumbling Stones upon us.</P>
<P><HI>They bid me</HI> &s;wim a&s;hore. <HI>I told them,</HI> I could $word$ &s;wim; but if they would have a little Patience till the Water flow'd, I would put the Boat to the

<P>They ask'd, <HI>How long it would be?</HI> I told them, <HI>A very little Time.</HI> At which they &s;eem'd ea&s;y, and &s;at down on the Rock.</P>
<P>I did not &s;ee above four there, but I could hear them &s;peak to others, who were behind in a Clift of the Rock. I look'd very narrowly to &s;ee if they had any Fire Arms, but perceiv'd none; yet dar'd not to come up, &s;tanding in the Scuttle, ready to drop my Head down, if there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd me,</HI> What Countryman I was? <HI>I told them,</HI> I was an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd,</HI> If I was &s;ent there by the King of <HI>Portugal? I told them,</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>They demanded,</HI> What I came there for? <HI>I told them,</HI> I was leaky, and wanted to hale a&s;hore to &s;top my Leak; but as there was no convenient Place, I de&s;ign'd to go to <HI>Porto Formo&s;a,</HI> where was a more convenient Place to hale a&s;hore.</P>
<P>By this Time the others behind the Rock came and &s;at down in Sight with the re&s;t: I told fifteen, and could not tell whether there were any more; but I &s;aw no Fire Arms among them, and was the more confirm'd in it, becau&s;e I thought if they had any, they would have made u&s;e of them again&s;t us.

<P>They call'd to me again, and ask'd, <HI>Why I did not come a&s;hore?</HI> I told them, <HI>I would pre&s;ently.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They &s;eem'd very impatient; and told me,</HI> If I deferr'd coming any longer, they would heave Stones till they &s;unk the Boat.</P>

<P>At this they &s;et up a hideous Hollow, ca&s;ting Stones as fa&s;t as they could, calling to one ano|ther to go home, and bring their <HI>Spring Guarda's,</HI> and fight for their Lives; I dived down as &s;oon as I perceiv'd them take up the Stones, and &s;hunn'd the Danger; my Men calling from afore to me, and telling me, <HI>We could expect nothing from them now but Death:</HI> And indeed I cannot &s;ay that my Expectation was of any thing el&s;e; but I was re|&s;olv'd to make the be&s;t I could of it, and bid my Folks hold their Tongues, and let me alone to manage them, and did not fear but we &s;hould do well enough.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as their Fury was over, and they ceas'd heaving Stones, which la&s;ted about half a Quar|ter of an Hour, their Hearts I believe fail'd them, and they got all behind the Rock. I look'd up,

I thank'd them, and continu'd talking about one Thing or another, till the Me&s;&s;enger came back that they had &s;ent, who brought a Calaba&s;h of Milk, and a large Cock and a Hen: They held them up, and &s;hewing them to me, de&s;ir'd me to put the Ve&s;&s;el to the Rock to take them in.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I could not put the Ve&s;&s;el to the Rock without Danger of &s;taving her.</P>

<P><HI>At la&s;t a lu&s;ty grim-look'd Fellow &s;aid,</HI> If I would put the Boat in at the Beach, &s;o that he could wade in, he would come; but, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I can't nor I won't &s;wim.</P>
<P>It being now almo&s;t Sun-&s;et, and the Wind much le&s;s in the Offing, &s;o that the Eddy-Flaws were now but weak, in&s;omuch, that I could ea&s;i|ly, by veering Cable, back her Stern to the Beach, and likewi&s;e there they could not do me much Damage, as being farther from the Rock, than as I rid; I told him, <HI>I would:</HI> So getting out two Oars, and veering Cable, and backing her Stern too with our Oars, till I could get Ground with a &s;hort Oar, I &s;et her in as nigh as I thought fit, and then bid him come; who was got down the Rock, and &s;tood on the Beach, armed with his Lance, Sword, and long Knife.</P>
<P>I bid him leave his Lance on the Beach, as being trouble&s;ome as well as needle&s;s to wade off with. He, with a he&s;itating Unwillingne&s;s, at la&s;t did, and waded off with his Sword, Knife, Cala|ba&s;h of Milk, and the two Fowls, holding them up that they &s;hould not be wet, and waded till the Water was as high as his Navel, and then &s;topp'd, and bid me put the Boat nigher in. I call'd to the Boy in <HI>Engli&s;h, not to veer any more Cable, and &s;et her in till the Cable was taut,</HI> and bid my Gue&s;t wade on.</P>
<P>He came, and by that Time he was got to the Boat's Stern, was up to the Arms. I told him, <HI>The Boat would not fleet any further in;</HI> &s;o he handed me the Milk and Fowls, and then would fain have got up with his Sword and Knife in his Hand. I told him, <HI>He need not fear to tru&s;t me with them.</HI> He &s;aw he could not get up with them in his Hand, and yet was very loth to tru&s;t

me with them; however, with abundance of Diffi|dence, he handed his Sword up to me, and en|deavour'd to get up with his Knife in his Hand, which they always tru&s;t to, as the &s;ure&s;t Weapon; but finding he could not, at la&s;t he handed that to me al&s;o, and then I gave him an End of a Rope for a Man-Rope, by which he got up.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he got in on the Quarter-Deck, he &s;aluted me with the u&s;ual Formalities, and pre|tended they were very &s;orry for the Rudene&s;s that they had offer'd to me. I told him, <HI>It was very well, I never bore any Malice, e&s;pecially when I was injur'd by a Mi&s;take, as I was &s;atisfy'd this was.</HI></P>
<P>The Fellow ey'd his Sword and Knife in my Hand, but was afraid, I believe, to ask them of me: I ob&s;erv'd it, but did not &s;eem to take any Notice of it.</P>
<P><HI>I was puzzled what to give them; and ask'd,</HI> If they wanted any Salt? <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> No, they had Plenty of Salt; for they could get enough to &s;erve them, made by the Sun on the Rocks; but he had heard, that there was a great Scarcity of Salt at the City; <HI>which I knew as well as he.</HI></P>
<P>The Fellow &s;eem'd to be very unea&s;y, and offer'd to take his Sword; but I would not de|liver it to him. He &s;aid, <HI>He wanted to go a&s;hore.</HI> I told him, <HI>He &s;hould pre&s;ently.</HI></P>
<P>I had a Felt Hat, which I had purchas'd at the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and having nothing el&s;e to give, I pre&s;ented him with that, telling him, <HI>That was all that I had worth giving; but wi&s;h'd I had one for every one that was a&s;hore.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>It was very well.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, <HI>I had no particular Knowledge of any of them, and therefore gave it among them all, for them to do as they thought fit with:</HI> So he de&s;ir'd me to put the Boat in again, that he might go

a&s;hore. I ask'd him, <HI>Whether he could not &s;wim?</HI> who &s;aid no; and &s;o I put the Boat as nigh to the Beach as I thought fit, and then bid him get into the Water, and I would hand the Hat and his Arms to him, as &s;oon as he was on the Ground.</P>
<P>I fix'd him a Man-Rope, and down he went by it; but by that Time his Feet touch'd the Bot|tom, his Chin was in the Water, upon which he call'd out to put the Boat nigher in, or he could not get a&s;hore. I bid him let go the Rope, and get a&s;hore, and I would heave the Things to him a&s;hore. He did &s;o; but mutter'd as he went, and I believe he never expected to get his Arms again.</P>
<P>However, when he was got a&s;hore, I hove the Things a&s;hore, and they all return'd me Thanks, and &s;aid, they would bring me a fat Goat, and &s;ome more Milk down in the Morning. I thank'd them; and it being almo&s;t duski&s;h, away they went, bidding me Adieu, telling me, that they would be down in the Morning betimes. I &s;aid it was very well.</P>
<P>I have been the more prolix in relating this, becau&s;e I do not know that I met with any thing in the whole of this Voyage, that appear'd to me more dangerous than this Adventure at fir&s;t did; and I can't deny but it gave as great a Shock to my Courage, as any thing that I can remember in the whole Cour&s;e of my Life.</P>
<P>The Night proving almo&s;t calm, I expected an off-&s;hore Land-bree&s;e; and waiting till the Morn|ing-Star ro&s;e, and no Land-bree&s;e coming, I drew up my Anchor, and rowed out, not caring to be caught among the Banditti another Day.</P>
<P>So we rowed out till we got into the true Wind, which was about the Break of Day, and I run down directly for <HI>Porto Formo&s;a,</HI> and into the Head of the Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="339">
Here I went a&s;hore, and was met by <HI>Sin|gore Antonio Thavaar,</HI> the principal Gentleman thereabouts, who was coming to &s;ee what Ve&s;&s;el it was that had enter'd into the Road: He was attended by eight Slaves with Lances, two had each of them a Pi&s;tol, which they are oblig'd to carry, being &s;o near Neighbours to the <HI>Vhilhaucas</HI> of <HI>Terra-fall:</HI> And when I told him how I had been &s;erv'd at <HI>Porto &s;ine Noma,</HI> he cro&s;s'd him&s;elf, and &s;aid, <HI>It was the greate&s;t Miracle in the World that we had not been all kill'd; and for his Part, he would not have been in my Place for the I&s;land of St.</HI> Jago.</P>
<P><HI>This Gentleman is a White, of the Race of</HI> Portugal; <HI>and when I told him what I had got on Board, he &s;aid,</HI> That there was no body at this Port, but very poor black People, and had nothing to give me in return for my Salt. As for him&s;elf, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he had a &s;mall Place on his E&s;tate, where his Slaves made Salt enough to &s;erve him; but if I wanted any thing that he could help me to, he would freely do it.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, and he invited me up to his Hou&s;e, which was not far off the Water-&s;ide, where I was entertain'd very courteou&s;ly. He would fain have had me to &s;tay all Night; but I told him, <HI>I never lay out of my Ve&s;&s;el at Night;</HI> &s;o he &s;ent two Slaves to wait on me down, and loaded them with Cocoa-Nuts, Mand'yokes, and a live Goat to kill on Board.</P>
<P>Next Morning he &s;ent down two Slaves with an A&s;s loaden with Provi&s;ions and Fruit, with an In|vitation to come and dine with him.</P>
<P>I, de&s;igning to get a little Wood and Water here, &s;ent Word up that I would; as &s;oon as they were got home, one of them with a Hor&s;e was &s;ent down for me.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="340">
When I came up, I ask'd the Gentleman leave to cut a little Wood. He told me, <HI>His Slaves &s;hould cut it for me, and carry it down.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I thank'd him, and &s;aid,</HI> My Folks had nothing el&s;e to do but to Wood, Water, and dre&s;s their Victuals.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <HI>He had Slaves enough idle:</HI> So he or|der'd half a Dozen of them to go and cut Wood, and carry it down with A&s;&s;es, till the People of the Sloop &s;aid they had enough.</P>
<P><HI>In the Afternoon I took my Leave of him, tho' he would fain have had me &s;taid till Night; but I told him,</HI> I wanted to be on Board to &s;ee that the Water was fill'd, and every thing got ready for &s;ailing before the Day-bree&s;e came; for if I &s;taid till it &s;et in, I could not get out of the Port.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> I knew what I had to do better than he; but if my Bu&s;ine&s;s would have permitted it, he &s;hould have been very glad of my Company: <HI>So, after Com|pliments pa&s;s'd, I took my leave.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ent a Slave down with me, and a little after came down two Slaves with a Bag of Fe&s;hoons, &s;ome Sherree, a Calaba&s;h of <HI>Mel, (i. e.</HI> Molo&s;&s;us) and half a Dozen of Chee&s;es, the &s;ix weighing about one Pound and half. I return'd him Thanks, which was all the Retaliation I could make, and I believe all the Gentleman de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>Next Day, as &s;oon as the Morning-Star ap|pear'd, I weigh'd, and &s;ail'd out of the Bay with a fine Land Air, and by dawning was got in the true Wind; and coa&s;ting along Shore, I run down the Length of St. <HI>Jago</HI> Town into the Bay, but did not ob&s;erve any convenient Place that I could land at, the Suff running &s;o high. My St. <HI>Antonio</HI>-Man was my chief Pilot, and I found him tolerably well acquainted with all the little Coves and Bays.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="341">
He told me, That a little farther was the be&s;t Port in all the I&s;land of St. <HI>Jago.</HI> According to his Advice, I run down, and enter'd into the Harbour, which was as he had told me, and call'd <HI>Porto Madera.</HI> I moor'd there, my Anchor off, and a Rope fa&s;t a&s;hore to a Rock, which was like a Key, having twelve Foot at low Water clo&s;e to the Rock.</P>
<P>There being no Inhabitants living near the Port, and the Way but indifferent from thence to the Village of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> I coa&s;ted along down to <HI>Praya Formo&s;a,</HI> and touch'd there, and at St. <HI>Domingo;</HI> from thence I proceed to <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> where I tarry'd &s;ome time, and receiv'd a Letter from the General of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands about a certain Bu&s;ine&s;s, and had a Man and Hor&s;e &s;ent for me.</P>
<P>I rid to him to the Town from <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> leaving my Boat there. It's accounted about 20 Miles by Land; but a Man had better ride 40 in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After the General and I had talk'd the Matter about which I came; being in Company, and talking about my</HI> Balandra, (i. e. <HI>Sloop, as they call'd it)</HI> Singore Pedro Balderave&s;&s;a <HI>ask'd me,</HI> if &s;he was capable of going to <HI>Guinea? I told him,</HI> She was not deck'd all over, but a &s;mall Charge would do it; and then &s;he might go to <HI>Guinea</HI> well enough.</P>
<P><HI>He ask'd me,</HI> How many Slaves &s;he could carry? <HI>I told him,</HI> About thirty at lea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> If I would bring her down to <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> that he might &s;ee her, he would buy her all; or if I was minded to continue in her, which he would rather, I might hold what Part I pleas'd; and whatever was wanting to the fitting her for a <HI>Guinea</HI> Voyage, he would procure; as al&s;o a Cargo.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="342">
<HI>I told him,</HI> She was at a good Port now; and that if he pleas'd to give him&s;elf the Trouble to go and &s;ee her, I would rather than to bring her down; becau&s;e <HI>Porto Lobo</HI> was more &s;ecure, e&s;pecially now that it drew nigh the Sea&s;on of &s;hifting Winds and <HI>Travadoes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> That <HI>Calyete</HI> was always reckon'd the &s;afe&s;t Port in all St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and that oftentimes when <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> Men came thither in the rainy Sea&s;on, they haled in there, where they lay &s;ecure from all Winds.</P>
<P>So I had a Hor&s;e back, and weighed from <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> and run the Coa&s;t down, rounding and taking a View of the Bays of St. <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> and <HI>Portate,</HI> in my Way; and by the Time that run the Length of <HI>Villa de Praya,</HI> I found I &s;hould not have Day-light enough to get into <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> &s;o I anchored there till next Morning, and then run for the <HI>Calyete;</HI> and after I had made her fa&s;t, I &s;ent Word to Town of my Arri|val, and had an An&s;wer the &s;ame Evening from Signor <HI>Pedro Balderave&s;&s;a, that he was a little indi&s;po&s;ed by a Fall that he had received &s;ince he &s;aw me; but had &s;poke to a Friend of his, who&s;e Judg|ment was better, who would come in the Morning to view my</HI> Balandra.</P>
<P>Accordingly his Friend came with another Gen|tleman, who was Secretary of War: He had u&s;ed the Sea, and I under&s;tood, that if I &s;old her out|right, he was to be <HI>Singore</HI> Capiteen; but he gave &s;uch an ill Report of her to <HI>Singore Pedro Balde|rave&s;&s;a,</HI> that I que&s;tion whether he would have ac|cepted of her, if I had offered her for nothing.</P>
<P>The &s;ickly Time of the Year now approaching, and, indeed, at that Time, excepting <HI>Cacheu,</HI> there are not many Places on the main Continent of <HI>Guinea,</HI> more &s;ickly than St. <HI>Jago;</HI> and be&s;ides, it being the Time of Year that rarely any Ships

touch here, I was re&s;olved, if I could, to get to &s;ome of the windward I&s;lands, e&s;pecially to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> as well to &s;hun the &s;ickly Sea&s;on at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> as al&s;o having a Pro&s;pect of &s;ooner meeting with an <HI>European</HI> Ship to get from the I&s;lands, the Sea&s;on of the Year al&s;o concurring; for we expected a Southern Wind now, in a little Time; and I trucked my Salt away as fa&s;t as I could to get on the Ea&s;t Side of the I&s;land, becau&s;e from thence, I could not only better &s;ail with a South|erly or We&s;terly Wind, but the Roads are the &s;afe&s;t al&s;o; for there is not one Road on the Lee-Side of the I&s;land, that a Man can ride &s;afe with a We&s;terly or South-We&s;t Wind, except <HI>Calyete St. Martin;</HI> but then, though you may ride &s;afe, yet with tho&s;e Winds you cannot get out; which, however, are the only fair Winds you have to run up to the windward I&s;lands.</P>
<P>I &s;oon trucked off my Salt, which the Inhabi|tants were in great Scarcity of, for <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Fe&s;hoons, and Mand'yoaks, which la&s;t, I &s;liced thin, and dried in the Sun to pre&s;erve them, which would then beat, or pound as fine, and look as white, as the be&s;t Flower, and, mixed with Maiz, would make good Bread; or boiled, would make good Pap, or Ha&s;ty-Pudding.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had bartered off all my Salt, and got a pretty good Cargo of Maiz, Fe&s;hoons, Man|d'yoaks, &s;ome Cocoa Nuts, Plantanes, Bananas, &amp;c. I &s;ailed from <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> and &s;topped at <HI>Porto Praya.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day it was calm, and in the After|noon a great Swell rowled into the Bay from the South-We&s;t, which made me fear a Southerly Wind; but it being calm, and having but few Hands to row out; be&s;ides, Night being &s;o nigh, I was nece&s;&s;itated to run the Hazard, by lying in the Bay all Night; though, to make my|&s;elf

as &s;ecure as I could, I run behind the little I&s;land, and anchored in Two Fathom Water.</P>
<P>It held calm all Night, the Sea continued to foam in from the South-We&s;t, and looked very black in the We&s;tern Board; which were all Signs of a South, or South-we&s;terly Wind: In the Morning at dawning, I weighed, and rowed out of the Bay, my Men &s;pelling one another at one Oar, and I rowing at the other, the little Boy &s;teering.</P>
<P>By the Time that we got the Length of the Southermo&s;t Point that makes the Bay, the Breeze appearing to come on the Water, we hoi&s;ted our Sails ready: It came on very weak; however, with the Wind, and the Help of our Oars to|gether, we got the Length of <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> where I de&s;igned to have waited an Opportunity of a Wind to run for the windward I&s;lands, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to touch fir&s;t at <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> where I knew there was a good Market for Provi&s;ions; but the Northern Stream being ju&s;t made, and the Wind beginning to fre&s;hen up at South-Ea&s;t, I changed my Re&s;olution, and &s;tood for <HI>Porto Madera,</HI> where I arrived, and moored before Night.</P>
<P>Here I waited Eight Days, and then having a Southerly Wind, which came pretty fre&s;h, I &s;ailed from <HI>Porto Madera,</HI> and &s;tretched over for the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and about duski&s;h, I was abrea&s;t of the <HI>Calyete,</HI> about Two Leagues offing.</P>
<P>The I&s;landers &s;aw me, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, being in Hopes I was bound to their I&s;land, they made a Light for me at the <HI>Calyete;</HI> but perceiving me pa&s;s that Place, and keep &s;till to the Ea&s;t|ward, they put out the Light, and made a great Fire at <HI>Paa Seco.</HI></P>
<P>I kept on my Cour&s;e to the Ea&s;tward, and when I came abrea&s;t of <HI>Navia Coveraada,</HI> I &s;aw another great Fire made there al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="345">
I &s;till kept on to Ea&s;tward, till I thought I was pa&s;t the <HI>Ghalloons,</HI> which is a Ledge of &s;unken Rocks &s;tretching a long way off, from the North-Ea&s;t Side of the I&s;land; and then I &s;teered as di|rect as I could, for <HI>Calyete St. Jorge,</HI> at <HI>Bona Vi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>As Night came on, the Gale decrea&s;ed, and by Two or Three of the Clock in the Morning, it was dwindled away to a flat Calm.</P>
<P>When Day broke out, <HI>Monta Pino&s;e</HI> bore about We&s;t-South-We&s;t, and I computed my&s;elf to be about Four Leagues, or better, from the nighe&s;t Part of the I&s;land; I could plainly &s;ee <HI>Bona Vi&s;ta,</HI> but after the Sun-ri&s;e, it di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>I lay driving in that Channel between the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> about Three Weeks, with variable light Airs of Wind, mo&s;tly calm; at la&s;t I got on the North-Ea&s;t Side of the I&s;land, and thought to have gone round that Way, and &s;o come to the <HI>Porto Engle&s;e;</HI> but the Wind and the Current &s;o baffled me, together with the Dulne&s;s of my Frigot's Heels, that I was hooked in behind the North-Ea&s;t Point; and the Ea&s;tern Trade|wind blowing, I was forced to bear away round the South-End of the I&s;land, by which Means I had an Opportunity of ob&s;erving the <HI>Reef,</HI> or, as the Pilots call it, a River which runs off a great Way from the Land, at lea&s;t One League and a Half, and &s;o far off, I believe, I &s;aw the Sea break: It's a Ledge of &s;unken Rocks, and great Stones; and from a Mile di&s;tance off, to the Shore, are &s;everal Swatches and Channels to go through, having Water enough for any Ship: There was a great rowling Swell, and the Wind fre&s;hened up, veering to the South-Ea&s;t, which made the Sea break where, I believe, there might be Two&punc; or Three Fathoms, or, perhaps, more, Water, where I went over.</P>

I thought I was without the Ledge, but ju&s;t before I was got the Length of it, I &s;aw the Sea break very high, as though it beat again&s;t a Rock, which did not a little &s;urprize me; for I was &s;hot &s;o far on, that I could not luff up enough to wea|ther it, and when the great Seas came on, they broke, &s;eemingly, to me, every where on it, be|tween me and the Shore.</P>
<P>I run for the &s;moothe&s;t Place; the Sea foamed, and rowled as if it was going to break, but did not; I &s;ounded going over, and the lea&s;t Water I had on it, was better than Four Fathom.</P>
<P>I got into <HI>Calyete St. George</HI> that Evening; the Night proved rainy, with Thunder, and abun|dance of Lightening, the Wind being from the South-South-Ea&s;t, to the South-We&s;t, and then flew about to the We&s;t-North-We&s;t, and North, and then cleared up.</P>
<P>We rid pretty &s;mooth, the Sands and Rock keeping off the Sea, though it blew pretty hard, while the Wind was at South-South-Ea&s;t, and South-South-We&s;t.</P>
<P>I lay there Two Days; but there being no con|venient Key or Rock to land at, I took the fir&s;t Opportunity, and got up to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Road, where was a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Lanch, which the Pirates had left there, and gave her to <HI>Domingo Gon&s;alvo,</HI> who lent her to me.</P>
<P>Having launched and brought her on Board, I employed People to get me a Cargo of Salt, and bring it down as fa&s;t as they could; which they could not do very fa&s;t, the late Rains having melted all the Salt in the Pans; however, they went to work, cleared the Pans of the Rain Wa|ter, and filled them up with Pickle; and, in about Three Weeks Time, I got Salt enough made, and heaped up; but the Way was &s;o wet and &s;lippery with the frequent Rains, that the

<P>When they &s;aw me, it daunted them, they thinking I was a Pirate; for &s;eldom, and very rare, any Ships touch at the&s;e I&s;lands at this Time of the Year.</P>
<P>The Captain, to be better informed, &s;ent his Yawl on Board; and he told me afterwards, if I had detained his Boat, or that he &s;aw me get under Sail, he would have &s;tood off, and prepared for Defence.</P>
<P>She was a &s;tout Sloop, had Eight Guns, and Sixteen Hands, and, if I be not deceived, the Captain was a Man of Courage.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Boat came on Board, I was not a little rejoiced to hear Men &s;peaking my Native Language; they asked me, <HI>Where I belonged to?</HI> I told them <HI>what I was,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P><HI>I &s;eeing they had no Arms, did not much mi&s;tru&s;t them; however, I did not care to ven|ture, till I was &s;ure; &s;o I told them,</HI> They &s;aw what I was, but I did not know what they were;

<P><HI>He immediately &s;ent the Boat for me again, to de&s;ire me</HI> to do him the Favour to come and anchor his Ve&s;&s;el in the be&s;t Birth of the Road, for he was not acquainted with it, neither had he any one on Board that was.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw the Boat coming again the Second Time, I began to fear they were Rogues, for he had a Jack En&s;ign and Pendant flying, which made him look the more &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>When the Boat came on Board, they told me their Errand; &s;o I went with them, and anchored the Ve&s;&s;el in a good Birth; the Bi&s;hop, &amp;c. was put a&s;hore directly; after which, the Captain and I had Lei&s;ure to talk.</P>
<P>I gave him an Account what I was, and the Occa&s;ion of my being in that Condition, &amp;c. He was very courteous to me, and offered to do any thing for me, that lay in his Power: I told him my De&s;ign of taking Salt in for St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> &amp;c. he told me, His People and Boat &s;hould put it on Board of me, and gave me &s;ome thin Canvas to mend my Sails with, and a Piece of an old Haw&s;er about Fifteen Fathom long, and made me lie on Board with him all the Time he &s;tayed.</P>
<P>He would fain have had me gone with him, which I was very willing to do, till I came to under|&s;tand the De&s;ign of the Voyage, which would no ways agree with what you may call humane or univer&s;al Ju&s;tice, neither was it &s;afe; however, I &s;hall not, as not thinking it proper, &s;ay any more of it; and this is the only Rea&s;on why I have not mentioned the Gentleman's Name.</P>

He had a good Stock of every thing u&s;ually carried to Sea, as Wine, Brandy, Sugar, &amp;c. and he was of a very free and generous Di&s;po&s;ition, and I fared, you mu&s;t think, after another Rate than I had done for a long Time pa&s;t; however, at fir&s;t I was very cautious and &s;paring, both as to my Eating and Drinking, for fear it might &s;tir up too quick a Ferment in the fluid Parts of my Body, by the unu&s;ual Addition of &s;uch hot active Spirits, as good Eating and Drinking commonly produce; but notwith&s;tanding my Caution, the new Diet, and &s;pirituous Drink, cau&s;ed an Agi|tation, or Ferment, though in&s;en&s;ible, till it came to the Heighth of a Fever, which increa&s;ed daily.</P>
<P>He would not let me go from on Board of him, and u&s;ed me as tender, as if I had been a near Relation, &s;ending the Boat with his Second Mate, to put the Salt on Board my Boat; and likewi&s;e to &s;ee and put every thing in order; he al&s;o of|fered me to &s;end his Second Mate in my Boat, with &s;ome Hands, and I to &s;tay on Board of him, where I could have any thing, and be better tend|ed, than on Board my owh Ve&s;&s;el; but then I con&s;idered the Unhealthine&s;s of St. <HI>Jago</HI> at that Time, which was as if a Man was to go to a Country where the Plague raged; likewi&s;e he was to &s;ail in a Day or Two, and was re&s;olved not to lie at St. <HI>Jago</HI> above Twenty-four Hours, as well to avoid the Contagion which then began to rage, as likewi&s;e the Danger of the Southerly and We&s;terly Winds blowing; though, as to the la&s;t, I could have &s;ecured my&s;elf, by running into the <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> but then I &s;hould have been in the mo&s;t &s;ickly Part of the I&s;land.</P>

<P>He &s;aid, <HI>He believed the Preparation was good,</HI> and with that, gave me about Half an Ounce of it, and ordered &s;ome Bread to be put in the Boat for me, and a Dozen of Wine, Half a Dozen of Brandy, a Piece of a Loaf of Sugar, &s;ome Butter, Oatmeal, Flower, and what el&s;e he could then think would be nece&s;&s;ary for me.</P>

<P>After I had taken my Leave, I went into the Boat, and was put on Board my own Ve&s;&s;el; and as &s;oon as they returned on Board, he weighed, and &s;ailed.</P>
<P>The Evening following, I al&s;o &s;ailed for St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which was the principal I&s;land for A&s;&s;es, and that was the fir&s;t Commodity Ships came to trade for in tho&s;e Parts, and mo&s;t an end a Ship touched at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> for A&s;&s;es, in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> or <HI>December;</HI> and tho&s;e that came in <HI>January,</HI> commonly loaded Salt.</P>
<P>I made St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in the Morning about Six of the Clock; the Wind was about South-We&s;t, and looked very dark and rainy, as well as windy|like, which made me loth to venture in, all the Roads of that I&s;land being open to tho&s;e Winds; &s;o I brought too, to con&s;ider what to do; we were then about Four Leagues off, I was very weak, but the Cold and Wet had abated the Heat of my Fever, together with the Care and Charge which I had upon me, as having no-body that I could tru&s;t.</P>
<P>After I brought too, it rained very hard, and blew, which held till about Four in the Afternoon, then the Wind veering about to the North-We&s;t, North-North-We&s;t, and at la&s;t to the North, and clearing up, promi&s;ed a fine, moderate, plea&s;ant Night; upon which I re&s;olved to run in a Cove, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Porto Ghuy,</HI> which I judged better, as having le&s;s Sea tumbling in, than at <HI>Paraghe&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>If it had continued untoward Weather, my De&s;ign was to run for the I&s;land of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> where there is both a &s;afe and &s;ecure Harbour for all Winds; but there being no Inhabitants, and I

being very ill and weak, if I grew never &s;o little wor&s;e, I &s;hould have been rendered un|capable of getting my Boat back, I having no|body that I could tru&s;t to: But the Weather breaking up, and promi&s;ing well, I run for <HI>Porto Ghuy,</HI> and got in and anchored, about an Hour after Night.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome of the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> People out there a fi&s;hing, and they had got a Fire in a &s;mall Cave a little Way up from the Sea. As &s;oon as we anchored, Two of them came down to the Sea Side and haled us; I an&s;wered, and told them who I was; they knew me, and immediately &s;wam off on Board, and were glad to &s;ee me, and &s;aid, <HI>They all thought the little Boy and I had been drowned; and &s;o did my Boy that I had left on the I&s;land, but were &s;orry to &s;ee me in that weak Condition;</HI> adding, <HI>That they wondered to &s;ee me come into that Road, e&s;pecially in the Night, for they never &s;aw any Stranger come in there before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That I had &s;een the <HI>Peek</HI> over the Port, plain before Night; and that I remembered it very well, ever &s;ince it was &s;hewed to me when I was at the I&s;land before.</P>
<P>One of them &s;wam a&s;hore, and brought me a Cag of &s;weet Water off, which I much longed and wi&s;hed for; the Water at <HI>Bona Vi&s;t</HI> being bracki&s;h, unle&s;s a Man brought it down Six or Eight Miles.</P>
<P>After they had &s;taid a little, and talked, they &s;wam a&s;hore to their Con&s;orts.</P>
<P>It held moderate clear Weather till after Mid|night, and then thickened, and about Three or Four a Clock, it rained &s;o hard, that notwith|&s;tanding the Sea that rowled in, and made a great Noi&s;e beating again&s;t the Rocks, yet we could for all that, hear the Rain Water running from the Mountains, and falling down the Rocks very

<P>After Eight Minutes it cleared up, and proved a fine clear Day, with a moderate Gale at North-North-Ea&s;t, and promi&s;ed fair &s;ettled Weather.</P>
<P>About Four in the Evening, I weighed, and &s;ailed from <HI>Porto Ghuy,</HI> with a light Off-&s;hore Wind; and when we got a brea&s;t of <HI>Porto Lappa,</HI> it fell calm, and about Two after Midnight, &s;prung up a moderate Gale at North-Ea&s;t-and-by-North.</P>
<P>Fearing I might mi&s;s the Port of <HI>Paraghe&s;i,</HI> it being very difficult to know it in the Night; I run down clo&s;e to the Shore, and now and then made one of my Mariners &s;ound; for there was a Sand-Bank lay about Half a League &s;hort of <HI>Paraghe&s;i,</HI> having about Four or Five Fathom Water on it, and reached about Half a Mile off from the Rocks, and was about One fourth of a Mile long; my De&s;ign was to anchor there till Day-light, if I could find it, and as &s;oon as Day broke out, to run to <HI>Paraghe&s;i:</HI> By good Fortune, with Care, I found it, and anchored on it in Four Fathom; and in the Morning, the Weather &s;till continuing as above, as well as likely to be, fair and &s;ettled, I took up my Anchor, and run into <HI>Paraghe&s;i,</HI> and let go my Anchor off, and an End of a Rope fa&s;t a&s;hore.</P>

<P>The Wind veering to the North-Ea&s;t, the Sky towards Noon became over-ca&s;t, as it often is with the Trade Wind, and looked fair Weather|like; but my Fear and Care being over, now I was got into a Harbour, &amp;c.

<HI>The Blacks that were pre&s;ent di&s;&s;waded him all they could, telling him,</HI> That it was impo&s;&s;ible for any Mortal to &s;wim off in &s;uch a Sea; and be&s;ides, the Sea beat &s;o powerfully again&s;t the Rocks, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible but that he &s;hould be da&s;h'd into a thou&s;and Pieces again&s;t them, if he attempt|ed it.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Had the Captain been &s;o kind to him to bring him here, and &s;hould he be afraid to hazard his Life to &s;erve him? no, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> it &s;hould never be &s;aid; <HI>and down he went to the Rocks Edge, and watch'd an Opportunity of the &s;moothe&s;t Sea, and darted him&s;elf into it, and got on Board.</HI></P>
<P>It was not from the <HI>Kaay</HI> that he leap'd, for that now was overwhelm'd every Sea; but the Rock that he jump'd off, was farther in the Bay, and where he jump'd from, was at lea&s;t 50 Foot above the Surface of the Water.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t afore he jump'd in the Sea, a Sea wa&s;h'd over the Bow, that frighten'd <HI>George</HI> and the Boy: I heard the Boy cry out, though <HI>George</HI> could not hear me. As &s;oon as the Black got on Board, he told <HI>George</HI> what I had order'd to do; but <HI>George</HI> &s;eeing the Sea all of a foaming Breach a-Stern of him, and in the Night &s;uch Sights &s;eem to be nigher to one than they really are, was afraid to veer any Cable, le&s;t the Boat &s;hould be in the Breach of the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>The Black told him,</HI> That he could be in no Danger; for that the Wind blew right in on the Beach, and that the Sea, if any thing gave Way, would heave the Boat in a Manner dry up.</P>
<P>He had promis'd me before he went off, when he heard me wi&s;hing my Boy was &s;afe a&s;hore, that he would engage to bring him off &s;afe, whatever befel the Ve&s;&s;el, or el&s;e that he would not come him&s;elf; and told <HI>George, He would take Care of the Boy,</HI> &amp;c. but all that he could urge or &s;ay to
<PB N="350" REF="359">
<HI>George,</HI> could not prevail with him to veer one Inch.</P>
<P>The Blacks from a&s;hore call'd to the Boat; who were an&s;wer'd by the Black that &s;wam off, <HI>That all was very well;</HI> but <HI>George</HI> made An&s;wer, <HI>No, it was not very well, for they expected every Sea to be fill'd.</HI></P>
<P>My greate&s;t Fear was of the Boy; and what with one Thing and another, the Sen&s;e of my Fever was gone; but I had &s;uch a Weakne&s;s, that all my Frights or Cares could not affect me &s;o as to overcome it; and I could not get up, nor walk one Step, without being &s;upported.</P>
<P>The Blacks perceiving my Concern much more for the Boy than for the Boat, as indeed it was, not &s;o much mattering her now; for we were got on an I&s;land, from whence we might expect a Deliverance, in as &s;hort a Time, as from any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands; the Blacks told me, <HI>I need not fear the Boy; for they were &s;ure, let the</HI> Balandra <HI>come off how &s;he would, that the Boy would be &s;afe.</HI></P>
<P>The Wind increas'd, and con&s;equently the Sea, which rowled right into the Cove; and though there is an I&s;land or Rock, which you would think might break off the Fury of the Waves, as be|ing then right to windward of the Boat, and in &s;mooth Water, and above the Surface of the Water twelve or fourteen Foot; yet now it did not &s;eem in the lea&s;t to &s;helter, but the Sea &s;eem'd to be rather wor&s;e by being broke, rowl|ing in over the Rock, which very &s;eldom now appear'd.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Sea with the Wind increas'd &s;o, that one would think it impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el, or even any one, to hold out, or re&s;i&s;t the raging Force of the Wind and Sea; which none can con|ceive, but tho&s;e who&s;e Lot (or I might &s;ay Mis|fortune)

it is to be expos'd to the raging Force of tho&s;e two Elements together. Soon after the Snore-fa&s;t gave way, and then &s;he &s;wung off, and rid in the Stream of her Anchor, and &s;eem'd to ride more ea&s;y, and play with the Sea bet|ter; and rid &s;o about half an Hour, when a Sea came foaming in, as tho' it &s;corn'd to be oppos'd, even by the high mountainous Rocks them&s;elves, and threatned to bear down all, as it were, before it, and to us &s;eem'd to &s;wallow up the poor Ve&s;|&s;el; for we did not &s;ee her for about the Space of a Minute.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of it was, the Cable broke, and that Sea carry'd her up on the Beach &s;o high, that &s;he lay undi&s;turb'd more than a Quarter of an Hour. As &s;oon as &s;he came a&s;hore, they all got out of her, and in the Fright run up the Valley as high as the Rocks would let them; but when they recover'd from their Fright, and &s;aw them&s;elves &s;afe, they return'd down again to the Boat, which lay all this Time quiet, as being out of the Reach of the Sea; <HI>George</HI> went on Board, and might have &s;av'd &s;everal odd Things, which I had pick'd up in the Time of my Pere|grination in her; but while he was in her, a great Sea rowl'd on, which was only the Forerunner of a greater; for it only &s;hock'd her; but &s;o fright|en'd <HI>George,</HI> and perhaps it would have done the &s;ame to any other, that he made all the Ha&s;te out he could, and brought nothing with him but a Bottle of that Wine, which my Friend had given me at <HI>Bona Vi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>As I &s;aid, that Sea that &s;hock'd the Ve&s;&s;el, was a Forerunner of a greater; for pre&s;ently after <HI>George</HI> got a&s;hore out of the Boat, a Sea came that &s;tav'd her all to Pieces; the Blacks that were with me went down to them, and gather'd all the Pieces of Boards, and what el&s;e they could, that
<PB N="352" REF="361">
the Sea hove on to the Shore; and one of them brought the Boy up to the Cave to me, where we remain'd till Morning.</P>
<P>I was as wet all Night, &s;itting on the Rock to behold the Boat, with the Rain and Spray of the Sea being blown up by the Violence of the Wind, as if I had been come out of the Sea; and it doubtle&s;s did me a great deal of Harm, and per|haps was one great Cau&s;e of that long and tedi|ous Sickne&s;s, which held me till after my Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> and was a principal Cau&s;e of my having Lei&s;ure to write this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Day broke out, by which Time the Weather began to clear up, and be more mode|rate, tho' a great Sea &s;till run, I could behold the Ruins of my Eight (I might &s;ay Ten or Twelve) Months Labour, lying piled up on the Shore. With the Help of &s;ome of them, I was carry'd down the Rocks, and view'd what was &s;av'd, which was mo&s;t Part of the Wreck, &s;ome Pieces of the Sails, one of my Iron Pots, an Ax, Saw, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> It was not proper nor &s;afe for one in my Condition, to be there expos'd to the Cold and Wet, and wi&s;h'd what I had already &s;uffer'd, did not prove of ill Con&s;equence to me; and that it would be better for me to go to Town, and take Care of my&s;elf, and &s;ee and &s;ell the Remains of my Boat, &amp;c. which they believ'd &s;ome of the Country People would buy to make Doors, &amp;c. for their Hou&s;es, and bid me not fear that any body would be &s;o barbarous, as to wrong me of the lea&s;t Bit of Wood.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did not trouble my&s;elf about that, as not being worth my taking Notice of: All that I was concern'd at, at pre&s;ent, was, how the little Boy and I &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t till a Ship came here, wherein
<PB N="353" REF="362">
I might get a Pa&s;&s;age to my own Country, or to &s;ome other Part where Ships more frequently trade.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> As for that, I need not fear but what I &s;hould meet with as good Entertainment as I did at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, &s;aving, that they had not &s;uch Plenty of Fle&s;h: But the Governor, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> never wants Goats Fle&s;h, and if you plea&s;e, we know you may be welcome to lodge there; but let me live with whom I would, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> they were &s;ure that he would always &s;end me wild Goat, more than I could eat.</P>
<P>I omitted to acquaint the Reader, that the Prie&s;t who was on the I&s;land when I was taken by the Pirates, was exchang'd, and another, who al&s;o was &s;ent from <HI>Portugal,</HI> plac'd there by the Bi&s;hop, who had touch'd here before he touch'd at <HI>Bona vi&s;t,</HI> and he was with the Bi&s;hop there, and very glad to &s;ee me, and gave me &s;ome Cloaths, and two Dollars in Money, and a Rug, a Pillow, and a Gun, which he had of mine along with him, when he was a&s;hore at <HI>Curri&s;al,</HI> when the Pirates took me; and al&s;o a Letter from him to the Padre who &s;ucceeded him at St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> he al&s;o procur'd a Letter from the Bi&s;hop to the two <HI>Fradre's</HI> who were at St. <HI>Anthonia,</HI> and govern'd that I&s;land for the Marque&s;s <HI>des Minhas,</HI> in Ca&s;e I touch'd there, to do me all the good Offices which they could; both which Letters they brought me with my other Things, when I was carry'd a&s;hore out of the Boat.</P>
<P>There was one of them that was down, had an A&s;s, and offer'd it to me to carry me up, and told me, <HI>I had be&s;t get up before the Sun ro&s;e too high; otherwi&s;e, as I was &s;o weak, it would make me very fainti&s;h to go up in the Heat of the Day.</HI> He added, <HI>That if no other A&s;&s;es came down, they would make &s;hift and carry the Boy up after me:</HI> So I was mounted on the A&s;s, and three or four ac|company'd

me up, and one or more ran up to Town before, to give the Padre and Governor an Account of my Condition, and al&s;o of my com|ing up.</P>
<P>I was met on the Way by <HI>Singore Nicholau Gon&s;alvo,</HI> with whom I had been acquainted be|fore, who&s;e Father had been formerly Governor of the I&s;land: He was &s;orry for my Lo&s;s, I be|lieve, with all his Heart, and te&s;tify'd &s;o much by his Tears, and oblig'd me to promi&s;e to live with him till I had an Opportunity of meeting with a Ship to carry me off the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>When I came up to Town, I rid directly to the Governor's Hou&s;e, who had made Prepara|tion to receive me; and as &s;oon as the Prie&s;t heard I was come, he came directly to welcome me to Town, as well as to condole with me in my Mis|fortune. I told them,</HI> I thought the greate&s;t of my pre&s;ent Misfortune was, my want of Health; and as for the Lo&s;s of the Boat, or any thing in her, I accounted it as nothing, &s;he having already an&s;wer'd my De&s;ign in Building her, which was only to bring me off of that lone&s;ome I&s;land, where &s;eldom any Ships came, to &s;ome Part where I might expect to meet with one; and hoped I was as likely to light of one here, as any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P><HI>The Prie&s;t &s;aid,</HI> He hoped I &s;hould: That as for his Part, he was a greater Stranger to the Na|ture of tho&s;e I&s;lands than I was, being but lately come from <HI>Portugal;</HI> but bid me re&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd, that during my &s;tay there, I &s;hould want for nothing that the I&s;land afforded, or was in his Power to do for me; and that he had often heard his Predece&s;&s;or Padre <HI>Duego</HI> talk very re&s;pectfully of me; and as I was in the Governor's Hou&s;e, he would not af|front him &s;o much, to ask me to go and live with him.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="364">
<HI>The Governor &s;aid,</HI> He expected me to live with him, while I remain'd on the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I mu&s;t beg him not to take it ami&s;s; for not having any per&s;onal Acquaintance with him, nor the Reverend Padre, I had already promis'd Sin|gore <HI>Nicholau Gon&s;alvo,</HI> my old Acquaintance, to live with him.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor &s;aid, Singore Nicholau</HI> was a good Man; and &s;ince I had given him my Word to live with him, which he was &s;orry for, yet knowing that <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are &s;o fixt to their Word, that they will not be induc'd for any Advantage to break it, he would not in&s;i&s;t upon per&s;wading me to what he by long Experience knew to be the natural Di&s;po&s;i|tion of all my Countrymen in general, and of me in a more e&s;pecial Manner; for he had, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> often heard Singore Padre <HI>Duego</HI> prai&s;e me, and &s;ay he believ'd I was one of the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> that ever he was acquainted with, and wanted nothing to make me a Saint upon Earth, but to be a Chri&s;tian <HI>(meaning a Roman).</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told the Padre,</HI> That I believ'd I had a Letter for him from Padre <HI>Duego,</HI> and likewi&s;e had one from the Bi&s;hop for the <HI>Fradre's</HI> of St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> but did not know how they could come by it.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> One of them was here at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> now, and he would &s;end him to me, and de&s;ir'd to &s;ee that Letter that was for him.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I had it not about me, but Singore <HI>Nicholau Gon&s;alvo</HI> was gone down to <HI>Paraghe&s;i,</HI> to fetch up my Things, and as &s;oon as he was come back, I would &s;end it to him.</P>
<P>By this Time the Victuals were ready, and brought to the Table, which were Fi&s;h, Fowls, Goats Fle&s;h, Indian Corn Bread, Plantanes, Ba|nana's, boil'd Pompion, &amp;c. the Fowls were bak'd in a Pot, and look'd very well, and as brown as if they had been roa&s;ted, and the Veni&s;on and
<PB N="356" REF="365">
Fi&s;h were boil'd, there was al&s;o a Calamow, which is a Calaba&s;h cut in two, and &s;erves them in the room of Ba&s;ons and Porengers; and this was brought to me full of Fi&s;h Water, being reckon'd by them the daintie&s;t Me&s;s they can give to a &s;ick or weak Per&s;on; however, I could not drink or &s;up it, tho' I put the Calamow to my Head three or four Times without ta&s;ting it, becau&s;e I would not have them think I &s;lighted the &s;ick Me&s;s.</P>
<P>I eat a bit or two of the Fowl, and after Din|ner lay down on a Bed, which was on Purpo&s;e &s;et up for me.</P>
<P>In the Evening <HI>Nicholau</HI> came up, and having carry'd all my Things that he brought up to his Hou&s;e, he came to the Governor's, and acquaint|ed me with what he had done; and I took my Leave of the Governor, and went to my Lodging, from whence I &s;ent the Prie&s;t his Letter.</P>
<P>The next Day the <HI>Fradre</HI> came, and I deliver'd him the Letter, which I had for him from the Bi&s;hop; who, after he had read it, came to me, and took me by the Hand, and ki&s;s'd it, and &s;aid, <HI>That he believ'd the Singore</HI> Bi&s;po <HI>never writ &s;uch a Letter for any Man before; and ask'd me if I was acquainted with his</HI> Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imo <HI>in</HI> Por|tugal?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The Singore <HI>Bi&s;po</HI> knew me very well.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <HI>He knew that by the Letter;</HI> and told m&eacute;, <HI>If I had come to St.</HI> Antonio <HI>with my</HI> Balan|dra, <HI>with nothing in her, I might have loaded her with Maiz, Fe&s;hoon, or anything the I&s;land afforded, and that gratis, and as often as I would;</HI> which he reported almo&s;t to every body; and &s;hew'd the Letter to the Prie&s;t and Governor, wherein was an Order, that they &s;hould &s;upply me with every thing that I wanted, which the I&s;land afforded,
<PB N="357" REF="366">
and charge it all to his Account, which made me be, in a very extraordinary Manner, re&s;pected.</P>
<P>My Fever return'd on me again, and burned and raged violently about eight Days; and after that, e&s;pecially in the Night, I us'd to &s;weat cold clammy Sweats, to &s;uch a Degree, that my Land|lady one Morning, to try how much Sweat &s;he could wring out, wrung the Bed Cloaths, which were Cotton, and &s;he wrung more than fill'd a quarter of a Canada, which, of our Mea&s;ure, is about three Eighths of a Pint; and doubtle&s;s there was more than that Quantity &s;oak'd into the Cotton be&s;ides, which, in my Opinion, was ex|ce&s;&s;ive; and it may be beyond the Belief of &s;ome, but I am &s;ure it was Fact.</P>
<P>After tho&s;e &s;weating Fits were over, I u&s;ed to be &s;o weak for an Hour or two, that I could not &s;tir, neither did I care for &s;peaking. I could hear and apprehend di&s;tinctly what any body &s;aid, which before I made them &s;en&s;ible of it, they thought I was in fainting Fits, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s; but when they found it was not &s;o, they were better &s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P>I had dry Cloaths every Morning, and &s;ome|times, when I &s;weat in the fore Part of the Night, which was but &s;eldom, they u&s;ed to &s;hift my Bed Cloaths in the Night: My Landlord Singore <HI>Ni|cholau Gon&s;alvo</HI> had Cotton Cloths enough, hav|ing the be&s;t, and, I may &s;ay, the only good Cot|ton Plantation on the I&s;land; and as &s;oon as ever the wet Cloaths were taken off, a Slave was &s;ent to the River to wa&s;h them, that they might be ready to u&s;e when I had occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>I was in this Condition about a Fortnight after the burning Fever left me, and then my Sweats abated; and as they abated, which were very gradually, my Strength a little increas'd; but

I recover'd my Spirits much &s;ooner than my Strength.</P>
<P>Either the Prie&s;t, the Governor, the Fradre, or one or other of the Inhabitants, u&s;ed to vi&s;it me every Day; and when I was in my weak Fits, they would never &s;peak to me, only come and look at me, and ask my Landlord, Landlady, on whoever of the Family was in the Way, how I was, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After I began to be a little hearty, my Land|lord ask'd me, <HI>What I would do with the Wreck that was &s;av'd?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> He might do what he pleas'd with it, and &s;uppos'd there could not be much of it left, if it lay down there all this Time.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He was &s;ure there was not one Piece of all that was &s;av'd dimini&s;h'd; for the Prie&s;t had charg'd them all publickly at Church, upon Pain of Excommunication, not to touch or take away the lea&s;t Bit of Wood, or any thing el&s;e, and pronounc'd Dam|nation to any one that would wrong me of &s;o much as a Nail.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If any of it would be of any U&s;e or Service to him, to take out as much as he had occa|&s;ion for, as having mo&s;t Right to it, and the re&s;t I would give to my Friends that I was mo&s;t obligated to, as he would advi&s;e and direct me.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I had no Occa&s;ion to give one Bit away to any body; he could have &s;old it all while I was &s;ick, but was loth to trouble me then, and would not di&s;po&s;e of it without my Order: <HI>And withal told me,</HI> That the Prie&s;t was minded to enlarge the Choir, and would have Occa&s;ion for all the Wreck, and bid me try what he would give me for it; and if he would give any thing hand&s;ome, he believ'd it would be my better Way to&punc; &s;ell it to him altogether, than have the Trouble to &s;ell it in Parcels to the People; and tho' I might make more, yet it would

<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would, and if there was any thing more which he thought he &s;hould have Occa&s;ion for, it &s;hould be al&s;o at his Service.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> No, he wanted only that, and he would not take it till it was valu'd by a Couple of Men, and would pay me the full Value.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would not take any thing of him, and he was welcome to all, or as much as he pleas'd.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> If I would not let him pay me for it, as much as I could have for it of any body el&s;e, he would not have it; but bid me &s;ell it with the re&s;t to the Prie&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>To plea&s;e him, I was forc'd to &s;ay he &s;hould pay for it; and he &s;poke to the Prie&s;t about it, who came to me, and after we had talk'd about it, the Prie&s;t &s;aid,</HI> He did not know the Value of it; $ut he would &s;end down two old Men, who &s;hould value it according to their Con&s;cience, and what they valu'd it at, he would give me, if I thought it &s;ufficient; if not, I might di&s;po&s;e of it as I thought fit, and he would give free Liberty for any one to buy who had Occa&s;ion: <HI>Without which Liberty, no body dared buy any thing that the Prie&s;t bid Money for.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Prie&s;t had bid two Men to go down, and <HI>Nicholau</HI> under&s;tood who they were, he &s;ent to them to come and &s;peak with him at his Hou&s;e before they went down; which they

did; and my Landlord told them, <HI>To act accord|ing to their Con&s;cience, and value the Things to the full Worth; for that it was publick Money that was to pay for it, and therefore could fall heavy on no particular body;</HI> adding, <HI>that I had had abun|dance of Misfortunes,</HI> and enumerated as many as he knew, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They &s;aid they would con&s;ider it, and would value every thing to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>When they return'd, and gave the Prie&s;t an Account, he came to me, and told me,</HI> That the two Men told him that the utmo&s;t of what all the Things were worth was ten Dollars, which he thought would not have come to above five; but &s;ince they had valu'd it &s;o, and the People were willing, it being their Money that mu&s;t pay for it, he being only Steward; and con&s;idering my Ca&s;e, he would not abate me any thing of that Price, tho', according to the Inventory they gave him of the Goods, he thought, as he &s;aid before, it was more than they were worth by one half.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There was one Piece, which was my Boom, that I would re&s;erve to my&s;elf for a particu|lar U&s;e.</P>
<P>He look'd in his Inventory, and &s;hew'd to me where they had noted it by the Name of <HI>Ballan|ceen,</HI> which in their Language &s;ignifies a <HI>Boom,</HI> and was rated a Dollar, and told me, <HI>If I kept that, I mu&s;t abate a Dollar, and take nine Dollars for the Remainder.</HI></P>
<P>My Landlord, who was pre&s;ent all the Time, made Signs at me, for he dur&s;t not &s;peak, not to agree to that.</P>

<P><HI>After he was gone, my Landlord told me,</HI> I had acted very well, and was glad I had not agreed with him; <HI>adding,</HI> That he would get &s;ome of his Friends to &s;peak to the Prie&s;t, and repre&s;ent the Ca&s;e to him, that I could &s;ell the Wreck for a great deal more; and that if he did not buy it, they could not get &s;uch Wood on the I&s;land as that was; <HI>(which indeed was true)</HI> and that he &s;hould not be able to enlarge the Choir, unle&s;s he bought that, or waited till he could buy Stuff out of Ships when they came here; which would not only be uncertain as to the Time, but would al&s;o come much dearer; and that he would al&s;o &s;peak to the two Men, who had been &s;ent to apprai&s;e it, who al&s;o were his Friends, &amp;c. <HI>All which he effectually did; and told me,</HI> That the Men apprais'd the whole at twelve Dollars; and that I &s;hould not abate any thing of that, without allowing any thing for the Boom, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next Evening, when it grew cool, I made &s;hift to walk to the Prie&s;t's Hou&s;e: My Landlord would not go with me, becau&s;e he would not give the Prie&s;t any Thought, that he advis'd any ways about it, tho' he had been per&s;wading the Prie&s;t, as his Friend, to buy it.</P>
<P>When I came to the Prie&s;t's Hou&s;e, he &s;eem'd to be indifferent about it: I being fore-advis'd, did not much mind it, and was inform'd that he was very eager of having the Choir inlarg'd. I
<PB N="362" REF="371">
told him, <HI>If he did not think well of it, I could &s;ell it for a great deal more than he talk'd of.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ent for the two Men, whom, I &s;uppo&s;e, he afore caution'd what to &s;ay: When they came, he ask'd them, <HI>Whether they thought in their Con&s;ciences the Things were worth more than ten Dollars?</HI></P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> They had given him an Account what they really thought they were worth, and every body was willing I &s;hould have it; as likewi&s;e that the <HI>Fradre</HI> had told them all, that it was a mortal Sin to wrong me: And, without doubt, <HI>continu'd they,</HI> your Reverence knows, how that the Singore <HI>Bi&s;po</HI> writ to u&s;e him as him&s;elf. <HI>At which I &s;aw the Prie&s;t wink at them, which made them hold their Tongues.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He ask'd me,</HI> How much I demanded for all the Wreck?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would not make any more than one Word, which was, that I would have <HI>9000</HI> Reas for all of it, and that Piece that I mention'd before &s;hould be excepted.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> That was too much. <HI>I told him,</HI> I un|der&s;tood it was not for his particular U&s;e, neither was it at his particular Charge, that it was bought; which, was it either, he &s;hould have it for nothing, or what Price he pleas'd; or, if the Singores of the I&s;land would accept of the Things, I would freely make a Pre&s;ent of them to the Church, not as a Re|compence, but as a Te&s;timony of Acknowledgment till I could pre&s;ent a better, for the many Favours and Kindne&s;&s;es I had receiv'd from them.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He thank'd me; and, for his Part, he expected nothing, neither did he believe any body would receive any thing from me by Way of Reta|liation, for any Kindne&s;s &s;hew'd me.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="372">
<HI>Abundance more of &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;s'd; and I told him,</HI> If they would not accept it as a Pre&s;ent, according to my Wi&s;h, but that I mu&s;t be oblig'd to take Money for it, I would have to the Value of it, or not at all; and if he thought well of it, I &s;hould be glad he would have it; if not, <HI>I a&s;&s;ur'd him,</HI> I could &s;ell it to the People for a great deal more than I ask'd him for it.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I &s;hould find a great deal of Trouble in that.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I believ'd not; for I had as many &s;poke to me already about it, as would take it all; and if he did not think fit to have it, I believ'd I could di&s;po&s;e of it all before to morrow at Noon.</P>
<P>He paus'd a while, and call'd &s;ome of them that were pre&s;ent a&s;ide; and after a little while re|turn'd, and &s;aid, <HI>He would give me</HI> 9000 <HI>Reas, but I mu&s;t not take the Boom; for he knew,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>I could not want it for my own U&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It was true; but I had promis'd a Friend to &s;ave it for him; and if he thought it was not worth &s;o much without that Piece, he &s;hould, if he pleas'd, have them for nothing; but if I &s;old them, I would have no le&s;s than I told him for them.</P>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>then you &s;hall have</HI> 9000: (which is twelve Dollars, a Dollar being reckon'd there at 750 Reas) So we agreed; and he told me, <HI>I might have my Money when I pleas'd.</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>It was very well.</HI></P>
<P>Some few Days after he pay'd me; which made me richer than I had been for &s;ome Years before; and I bought a large Hog for a Dollar and half, and had it kill'd. My Landlord would have had me &s;old the Maiz and Fe&s;hoon which lay on the Rock at <HI>Paraghe&s;i;</HI> but I told him, <HI>I would not; but bid him take what he had Occa&s;ion for, and let the Poor, or any that wanted the re&s;t, take it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="373">
He took, I believe, about the Quantity of five Bu&s;hels, the whole of what was laid on the Rock being about forty or fifty Bu&s;hels; and then I gave Liberty for every body that wanted, to take the re&s;t; which mightily rais'd me in E&s;teem with the Inhabitants, e&s;pecially the poorer Sort.</P>
<P>I recover'd my Strength a little; but pre&s;ently after fell fir&s;t into a quotidian, than a tertian Ague, which kept me very weak; for my cold Sweats, which I had the latter End of the cold or &s;haking Fit, came again; but nothing to the Exce&s;s that it was before.</P>
<P>I thus pa&s;s'd, or rather linger'd my Time away, till about the latter Part of <HI>October,</HI> when, to my great Satisfaction, I had News of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship being arriv'd at this I&s;land, and that &s;he anchor'd in the Port of <HI>Terra-Fall.</HI> It was late in the Evening when I heard the News, and I immedi|ately re&s;olv'd to go down that Night. My Land|lord per&s;waded me all he could to defer my Jour|ney till the Morning, for fear of catching cold, &amp;c. but I was fix'd in my Re&s;olution; and while he and his Son were gone to catch a Hor&s;e for me to ride down upon, to my yet greater Satis|faction, I had a Letter from the Captain, brought me by one of the Blacks, who was down at <HI>Terra-Fall</HI> when the Ship came to an Anchor; for as &s;oon as that was done, the Captain ob&s;erving People a&s;hore, &s;ent his Boat to bring off &s;ome of them, or, if they were not willing, to give them an Account what he was, and what he came to trade for, as likewi&s;e to inform him&s;elf whether there had been any Pyrates about the I&s;lands.</P>
<P><HI>Several of them went off in the Boat on Board, who inform'd the Captain of me, as far as they were capable of; and when they nam'd my Name he remember'd me, tho' we never had had any per&s;onal Acquaintance together; but the Year

before, at</HI> Bona Vi&s;t, <HI>he fell into the &s;ame Pirates Hands that I had, from whom he heard of my being taken; and the Blacks relating to him, my being Shipwreck'd at St.</HI> John'<HI>s, of my building a</HI> Balandra <HI>there, and of my lo&s;ing her here, &amp;c. he told them,</HI> He knew me; <HI>and asked them,</HI> If any of them would carry a Letter from him to me; <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> With all their Hearts; <HI>&s;o he immedi|ately writ to me, acquainting me</HI> of his Arrival, his de&s;igning to trade there for Cotton Cloths, Money, or what el&s;e I would inform him that the Country afforded, that would be worth his purcha&s;ing; and that he had, he believed, a very good Cargo for the&s;e I&s;lands, and referred particularizing, 'till he &s;aw me, and &s;hould expect me down at the Port To-morrow, if I was able; that he heard from the Blacks, that I was not very well; but hoped, not &s;o ill as not to be able to come down; that he would have come up to me, but was afraid to leave his Ve&s;&s;el; but if I found my&s;elf unable, he would ven|ture up; but would rather, I could, make any Shift to get down, for he thought I &s;hould &s;ooner re|cover both my Health and Strength with him, than where I was; and de&s;ired me to compliment the Prie&s;t, Governor, and who el&s;e I thought proper, in his Name; and either let him &s;ee, or hear from me To-morrow.</P>
<P><HI>At the peru&s;ing of this Letter, I deferred my Journey till the Morning; but in the mean Time acquainted the Prie&s;t and Governor,</HI> That the Captain gave his Service to them, and was come to trade for Cotton Cloths, and I could not tell what el&s;e he would trade for.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> If he brought any Cotton from <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> they would willingly exchange Cloths for Cot|ton; but they need not tell me, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> who knew &s;o well the Nature and Productions of all the&s;e I&s;lands, even better than they did them&s;elves, that
<PB N="366" REF="375">
Cotton had been &s;o &s;carce for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, that they believed hardly any would &s;ell their Cotton Cloths, unle&s;s for Cotton, for fear of wanting them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;oon had all the Inhabitants about me, who all wi&s;hed he had rather been a Trader for A&s;&s;es, than Cotton Cloths.</P>
<P>Next Morning before Day, the Governor and I, and &s;everal others, went down; the Prie&s;t was to come after he had &s;aid his Ma&s;s, which is every Morning in St. <HI>Nicholas Church,</HI> unle&s;s Sick|ne&s;s, &amp;c. hinders; my Landlord, poor Man, could not come, being &s;o bad with a Pain in his Back, occa&s;ioned by a Wrench, and a Cold upon that, that he could not &s;it an A&s;s, which gave us both no &s;mall Concern.</P>
<P>We got down about Ten a Clock, having been on the Journey about Eight Hours; Capt. <HI>John Harfoot,</HI> who&s;e Ve&s;&s;el was a Brigantine about Sixty or Seventy Tuns, &s;aw us coming Time enough to get a&s;hore with the Boat before we got to the Sea Side, and had got a Sail a&s;hore, and a Tent fixed.</P>
<P>He received us very courteou&s;ly, and was glad to &s;ee me, as I was more to &s;ee him there: After we had talked a while about Trade, and I had given him &s;everal Hints relating to it, he took us on Board.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;t came down about One a Clock, for whom Captain <HI>Harfoot</HI> &s;ent his Boat. In the Evening they went a&s;hore, and &s;o to Town; but I &s;taid; after which we had more Lei&s;ure to talk.</P>
<P>I told him the Nature and be&s;t Method of Trading, &amp;c. &s;o far as related to the Di&s;po&s;al of his Cargo; and he very kindly offered me my Pa&s;&s;age, and what Entertainment his Ve&s;&s;el af|forded, for me and the Boy, and told me the De|&s;ign
<PB N="367" REF="376">
of his Voyage, which was to trade among the I&s;lands about Two Months, and then run for the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where he was to meet a Ship to take his Cargo of Cotton Cloths from him; and told me, as I knew it very well my|&s;elf, <HI>That when I got to that I&s;land, I might get an Employ there, or, if my Affairs required my going home, I need not fear &s;omething in my Way; but if not, I was welcome to go home with him, if I &s;o thought fit.</HI></P>
<P>I thanked him, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with my Ad|vice all I could, and &s;erved as Lingui&s;t for him; for neither he, nor any on Board, could &s;peak either the <HI>Creole</HI> of the I&s;lands, or <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> either of which, would have been &s;ufficient to trade with.</P>
<P>I could have put him in a Way to have pur|cha&s;ed One thou&s;and Cloths, or more, at an in|con&s;iderable Price; but as the Space of Two Months, which was all the Time he could tarry among the I&s;lands, was not long enough for that Purpo&s;e, I omitted to acquaint him with it.</P>
<P>He was re&s;olved to tarry there Two or Three Days more, if the Weather did not force him away; for though it be u&s;ual for the con&s;tant Trade Winds to &s;et in before this Time, yet the Sky promi&s;ed &s;ome more Rain, the which would probably cau&s;e a Shift of Wind; however, I went up to Town, choo&s;ing a promi&s;ing Sky for fair Weather, he promi&s;ing me faithfully, that if he was forced off before I could come down, that he would touch there again for me.</P>
<P>I went up to get my Cloaths, &amp;c. and to bring the Boy down, and take my final Leave of the Inhabitants; all which I cho&s;e to do per&s;onally, becau&s;e I could be &s;erviceable to his Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="377">
I had &s;poke to him about <HI>George,</HI> and that I believed he would be glad to work for his Pa&s;&s;age to get off the&s;e I&s;lands, and gave him an Account, as far as <HI>George</HI> had given me: The Captain told me, That he had his full Complement of Hands, and had no Occa&s;ion for any more; but rather than the young Fellow &s;hould &s;tay there, he would give him his Pa&s;&s;age; &s;o when I came up to Town, I told <HI>George,</HI> who &s;eemed rejoiced at it.</P>
<P>I took my Leave of the Inhabitants, and the Boy and I went down the &s;ame Night, <HI>George</HI> following us the next Morning; as &s;oon as Cap|tain <HI>Harfoot</HI> &s;aw the little Boy, he wondered how I came to take &s;uch a little Child to Sea, who, he &s;aid, was fitter for a Nur&s;e, than to do me any Service.</P>
<P><HI>I told him my Rea&s;ons for taking him, as I have afore related; he commended me for it, but &s;aid,</HI> He wondered how I could take Care of the Boy, and bring him with me in &s;o many Difficulties; and that a great many Men would have left him at St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That I thought it would be an un|chri&s;tian, as well as an inhuman Act, to have left a Child &s;o, to be brought up in a manner like an Infidel.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> That was true; but there were Thou|&s;ands that would have left him; <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> That I &s;hould find it very chargeable to get him home.</P>

<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it will co&s;t you nothing for him to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> for you are as welcome to his Pa&s;&s;age thither, as if it was your own Ve&s;&s;el. <HI>I returned him many Thanks for his Kindne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>George</HI> came down, he haled the Bri|gantine; Captain <HI>Harfoot</HI> asked me, <HI>If that was the Man?</HI> I an&s;wered, <HI>Yes;</HI> he &s;ent the Boat for

<P><HI>The Fellow look'd very dejected, and told him,</HI> That he was a Pri&s;oner on Board with the Pirates, and was con&s;train'd to do what he did, as not daring to refu&s;e whatever they thought proper to command him.</P>
<P><HI>The Captain bid him</HI> hold his Tongue, and tell them &s;o that knew no better; and that if he had not the Impudence of the Devil, or his Ma&s;ter <HI>Loe,</HI> he would not come to ask him any Favour, &amp;c. <HI>Adding,</HI> That if he was &s;ure to find a Man of War to put him on Board of, before he went from the I&s;lands, he would give him his Pa&s;&s;age to it; <HI>and turning to me, &s;aid,</HI> If a Body &s;hould take that Villain on Board to carry him to Ju&s;tice, and &s;hould meet any of his Brother Villains, <HI>(meaning the Pirates)</HI> a Man could expect nothing but Death; <HI>and turning to</HI> George, <HI>who to all this reply'd not a Word, he &s;aid,</HI> I will &s;end you a&s;hore again; but if I meet with any of his Maje&s;ty's Ships before I leave the&s;e I&s;lands, I will give them an Account of you, and per&s;wade them, all I can, to come and give you a Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Tyburn;</HI> and hope e'er long to hear of

<P>We tarry'd four Days after at <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> and the Captain having engag'd him&s;elf to go down to the City, to take in &s;ome Water-Casks there, and the Remainder of our Provi&s;ions for the Voyage, we weigh'd from <HI>Porto Praya November</HI> the 15th, and anchor'd at the City the next Day, about ten in the Forenoon; and having fill'd the Remainder of our Water, and got the re&s;t of the Negroes Provi&s;ions in, we &s;ail'd from <HI>Porto Cidade</HI> about the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> and &s;tretch'd away to the Northward.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were &s;hot clear of the Lee of the I&s;land, we met with a Head Sea, which we head|ed the more, by the Winds veering far to the Ea&s;t|ward. The Ship hourly increas'd leaking, in&s;omuch that we were forc'd to keep one Pump con&s;tantly going. We had about 180 Slaves on Board, a Portugue&s;e <HI>Supercargo, Scrivan,</HI> and <HI>Tunnalheer,</HI> and Singore <HI>Antonio de Barra,</HI> late Governor of <HI>Cacheu,</HI> who, upon my Aequaintance with him, went on Board us as a Pa&s;&s;enger to <HI>Lisbon;</HI> tho', before I went, he had re&s;olv'd to wait another Opportunity, by Rea&s;on the Ship had been &s;o leaky.</P>
<P><HI>The Ship &s;till growing leakier and leakier, Cap|tain</HI> Durel <HI>ask'd my Opinion,</HI> What I thought of it? <HI>I told him,</HI> He and tho&s;e who had been the Voyage in the Ship, and had &s;een her Bottom, were the be&s;t Judges.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="384">
<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He was &s;ure her Bottom was &s;ound and tight, and that her Leaks were none of them below the Waters Edge.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Portugue&s;e <HI>were all for going back to St.</HI> Jago <HI>to &s;top the Leaks; but the Captain &s;aid,</HI> He was afraid, if he put back there again, they would land the Cargo there, and would not put it on Board him again; be&s;ides, there were no Carpenters to be had there, nor any thing el&s;e: That if the I&s;lands <HI>(meaning St.</HI> Nicholas, <HI>St.</HI> Lucia, <HI>St.</HI> Vin|cent, &amp;c.) had any convenient Road, he would ra|ther try to find the Leaks at one of them; and as we could not be furni&s;h'd, either with Carpenters or Stuff at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> &s;o we could do as much at one of tho&s;e I&s;lands, as at St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That was very true; and as for finding a Road, I would, with God's Leave, if he de&s;ir'd it, anchor him in a better Road by far, than any that he had been at in St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He ask'd,</HI> If there was Wood and Water to be got there.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> At St. <HI>Vincent</HI> there was both, and al&s;o at St. <HI>Lucia;</HI> but 'twas difficult to get them on Board.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He had heard a great Talk of St. <HI>Ni|cholas</HI>'s being one of the be&s;t of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The I&s;land was well enough; but then the &s;ame Hazard that he fear'd at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> might as well befal him there, &amp;c. <HI>After which he re&s;olv'd for St.</HI> Vincent.</P>
<P>We fetch'd in to Leeward of St. <HI>Lucia;</HI> it blew fre&s;h, and we found the Channel between St. <HI>Antonio</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> a windy one, to beat up; for which Rea&s;on, we cho&s;e rather to run to St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> and let go our Anchor in a fair clean &s;andy Bay; but the Captain being a little fearful, would not run in far enough, but let go the An|chor,

which was rather too light, on the Edge of the Bank. Our Misfortune was, to be very weak|handed, and, which was wor&s;e, &s;ome of them were the mo&s;t grumbling, lazy, and unwilling Men that ever I &s;aw on Board of a Ship: And about an Hour after the Anchor was gone, there being only the Foretop&s;ail handed, and that too by a Couple of Negroes, a Flaw of Wind came off the high Land, and what with the Sails not being handed, together with the Lightne&s;s of the Anchor, the Ship drove off the Bank out of Soundings.</P>
<P><HI>They were for veering more Cable; but I told them,</HI> They had better heave the Anchor up; and if they had a Mind to ride the Ship, they mu&s;t run in on the Bank into four or five Fathom Water.</P>
<P>I began to think I was got on Board a Pirate, for there was &s;uch &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, &amp;c. that it would have made a &s;ober Man's Hair &s;tand an End; and I was too weak to be able then to do much, having daily a Fever and Ague, and the Captain, poor Gentleman! almo&s;t in as bad a Condition, having al&s;o an Ague, tho' not &s;o fre|quently. The Mate hove the Lead to &s;ound, but we were out of Soundings: The Folks then &s;wore, <HI>They would not heave up the Anchor; or if they did, they would not lay a Hand on any thing to work in her; they did not know what the De&s;ign was;</HI> and a thou&s;and other &s;uch Speeches, attended with thundering Oaths and Cur&s;es, &s;uch as Igno|rance, join'd with arrogant Sawcine&s;s, is wont to produce; tho', at the &s;ame Time, it was the Negroes that did in a Manner all the Labour.</P>
<P>The Captain could not, nor, I believe, any body el&s;e, forbear being in a Pa&s;&s;ion, tho', in|deed, it avail'd him nothing; however, the Re|&s;ult was, to take our Chance, and put to Sea again, which accordingly was done; and about

the Latitude of between 24 and 25 Degrees North, it blowing a &s;tout fre&s;h Gale, the Water increas'd &s;o fa&s;t, that all Hands were call'd, both Pumps mann'd, and two Gangs &s;et to baling with Tubs and Buckets out of the Hold; but for all that the Water &s;till increas'd.</P>
<P>I had then an Ague-Fit, and Captain <HI>Durel</HI> ask'd my Opinion, and what I would advi&s;e him to do?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There were but two Ways that I knew of, to have a Chance to &s;ave his Ve&s;&s;el, tho' he might &s;ave his Life by a &s;horter Run.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He thought it would be be&s;t to run for St. <HI>Jago,</HI> or any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands that we could fetch; and ask'd me, If there were no Harbours at the I&s;lands of <HI>Fogo</HI> or <HI>Brava,</HI> in Ca&s;e we &s;hould not be able to fetch St. <HI>Jago?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There was a better Harbour by far at the I&s;le of <HI>Brava,</HI> than any he had &s;een at St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P>Then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I think our be&s;t Way will be, to run for the I&s;lands at once.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I believ'd we &s;hould not be able to fetch any of them by &s;everal Leagues as the Wind was; for at our parting from the I&s;lands we had the Wind the common Trade, but it was now got to Ea&s;t and Ea&s;t-by-South.</P>
<P><HI>He ask'd me then,</HI> What we mu&s;t do? Why, <HI>&s;aid I, (for we had taken in our Top&s;ails already to ea&s;e her)</HI> we do not gain upon the Water which leaks into the Ship, but that rather gains upon us; and if we do not find &s;ome Way or other, either to ea&s;e the Ship, or &s;top &s;ome of the Leaks, it is plain we mu&s;t go to the Bottom; for that the Negroes, who were the chief, and indeed I might &s;ay, &s;ole Dependance, as &s;oon as they were tir'd, or this Fright over, or any &s;ullen wilful Notion came in their Heads, would leave off both baling and pump|ing;
<PB N="378" REF="387">
and, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if one Pump drawing would keep the Ship free, I doubt whether the Sailors would do that, without the Negroes A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Durel <HI>&s;aid,</HI> He knew it too-too well, but could not help it him&s;elf:&mdash;But what could he do?</P>
<P>Do, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you mu&s;t put the Ship away lasking, or afore the Wind, which of them will in your Judg|ment ea&s;e her mo&s;t, and I will go down and try if I can find, and &s;top any of the Leaks.</P>
<P>He agreed, and we put the Ship afore it, under her Fore&s;ail; after which they gain'd upon her. I found out two large Leaks under the Timbers, and chinch'd them as well as I could, and &s;top'd the Current of the Waters coming in, in a great Mea&s;ure; &s;o that after we had got her to &s;uck, we could keep her free with one Pump.</P>
<P>We had another great Misfortune, which was, the Sand Balla&s;t being wa&s;h'd down through the Cieling, every now and then &s;o choak'd the Pumps, that we were forc'd to draw the Boxes to clear them, and occa&s;ion'd them to want leathering, &s;ometimes once, twice, and oftner, in twenty-four Hours.</P>
<P><HI>After I had &s;top'd tho&s;e two Leaks as well as I could, and the Ship &s;uck'd, the Governor telling me,</HI> That if it had not been for me, he would not have ventur'd in the Ship; <HI>I told him,</HI> He could not, with any Rea&s;on, blame me; for if I had fore&s;een any Hazard, I &s;hould not have ventur'd my|&s;elf; but that I thought it more prudent now, to re|&s;olve upon &s;omething &s;peedily, to &s;ecure our&s;elves, the Ship, and the Cargo.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> As for the Ship or Cargo, it did not in the lea&s;t concern him, although, he believ'd, he had as good an Intere&s;t in the Cargo as any one Man; <HI>and &s;o I&punc; believe he had;</HI> But, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if there be any Cour&s;e to be taken, why don't you and the
<PB N="379" REF="388">
Captain re&s;olve upon that which you &s;hall think the le&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The Captain was not willing to de|termine any thing till he had con&s;ulted with, and had the Concurrence of him, the Supra-cargo, and the re&s;t of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Gentlemen, who were in|tere&s;ted in the Charge of the Cargo, as much as he of the Ship.</P>
<P><HI>He ask'd,</HI> Why we had not call'd them together before?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> We had not Time till now; for till in &s;ome mea&s;ure we had &s;topp'd as much of the Leaks as we could, and had &s;uck'd the Ship, it was in vain to con&s;ult, or re&s;olve to run any where; that now, Thanks to God, we had freed the Ship, and it was to be hoped, tho' not without Care and abundance of Labour, we &s;hould, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Negroes, be able to keep her free, till we could recover &s;ome Port; and he being the Principal, Captain <HI>Durel</HI> thought proper he &s;hould be acquaint|ed fir&s;t, and, if he pleas'd, he might call the re&s;t; <HI>who all this while, e&s;pecially the Supra-cargo, were crying out for their Country and Wives, and commending them&s;elves to all their Saints and Patrons, wringing their Hands, &amp;c. He imme|diately had them all call'd aft, Captain</HI> Durel <HI>and I, in the mean time, having concluded to run for</HI> Barbadoes, <HI>where I &s;atisfy'd him that we could refit the Ship, if capable; if not, he could there with Ea&s;e &s;ecure the Cargo for half Freight.</HI></P>
<P>We had &s;ome Talk how he &s;hould rai&s;e Credit, he being utterly a Stranger there, neither he nor his Mate having ever been in any Part of <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI> except <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> and when they were all come aft, Captain <HI>Durel</HI> de&s;ir'd me to &s;peak to them, for that he thought they would be ea&s;ier per&s;waded by me than by him; which I did, and propos'd our running to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> becau&s;e of the
<PB N="380" REF="389">
Certainty of a large Wind all the Way, which would much ea&s;e the Ship, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>The Supra-cargo was altogether for going to the</HI> Cape de Verd <HI>I&s;lands. I &s;hew'd him the almo&s;t Impo&s;&s;ibility of fetching them, the Danger of &s;training the Ship with &s;ailing upon a Wind,</HI> &amp;c. And &s;uppo&s;ing it were po&s;&s;ible to fetch St. <HI>Jago, &s;aid I,</HI> you have no Anchor that would bring you up, and only a &s;mall Yawl, with which you could hardly &s;ave your Lives, much le&s;s your Slaves, your Wax, or any thing of the Cargo.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor &s;aid,</HI> But is there no Place that we could run with a large Wind but <HI>Barbadoes? I told him,</HI> We could run to <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> but then we &s;hould not be &s;o certain of meeting Conveniencies there as at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> they build Ships there, and <HI>Bar|badoes</HI> is but an I&s;land, I &s;uppo&s;e, like St. <HI>Jago,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It was true, it was an I&s;land; but I doubted whether he could have any thing at <HI>Lisbon</HI> which was not at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> except a King, a Pa|triarch, a Nobleman, and a Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P><HI>The Gentleman &s;mil'd, notwith&s;tanding his Dread and Apprehen&s;ion of Danger, at my Ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and &s;peaking to the</HI> Portugue&s;e, <HI>&s;aid,</HI> What &s;ignifies our talking, its better we let the Captain and <HI>Singore Robertus</HI> con&s;ult together with|out di&s;turbing them: We are not able to a&s;&s;i&s;t, but only confu&s;e them; they know better than any of us; and as for any particular Intere&s;t, <HI>Singore Rober|tus</HI> has the lea&s;t of any one on Board, unle&s;s in the greate&s;t Concern, common to us all, namely, the Pre|&s;ervation of our Lives.</P>
<P><HI>They all agreed, and the Supra-cargo &s;aid,</HI> He would leave it entirely to <HI>Singore Robertus,</HI> to car|ry the Ship where he thought propere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="390">
<HI>I told them,</HI> I would not do any thing that Way; I only deliver'd my Opinion of what I thought was propere&s;t, and &s;afe&s;t, but was to be govern'd more e&s;pecially by Captain <HI>Durel</HI>'s Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;aid,</HI> If I thought to go to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> was be&s;t, they all con&s;ented to it.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;aid,</HI> If Captain <HI>Durel</HI> thought &s;o, it was my Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Yes, he concluded it to be the be&s;t Way.</P>
<P><HI>Then I &s;aid,</HI> I thought the Supra-cargo, Scrivan, &amp;c. ought to &s;ign an In&s;trument to te&s;tify their free Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, <HI>With all their Hearts;</HI> and accord|ingly one was drawn, and &s;ign'd by them all; upon which we made &s;ail, to the great Satisfaction of all, the Negroes e&s;pecially; for as &s;oon as they came to under&s;tand that we were going to &s;ome Land, they hollow'd, and &s;aid, <HI>They would &s;tand by the Pump Night and Day.</HI></P>
<P>We run about three or four Days, having &s;ometimes light, &s;ometimes taut Gales; another Leak breaking out, &s;he made &s;o much Water, that we fear'd we &s;hould not be able to keep her from &s;inking: We went down in the Hold, and at la&s;t heard the Leak, which was right again&s;t the Well, on the Starboard Side. We clear'd away, and cut the Ceiling, and it prov'd like the other Leaks under a Timber. I much fear'd it was a Butt; but there being no Way to &s;top it but cutting the Timber away, nor no keeping the Ship above Water without &s;topping it, we re&s;olv'd upon the latter, by doing the former; however, I call'd Captain <HI>Durel</HI> to &s;ee it, and told him what I thought, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was a Butt; but withal, the Impo&s;&s;ibility of keeping the Ship above Wa|ter without &s;topping it: He gave his Con&s;ent, I cut, and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a <HI>French</HI> Man,
<PB N="382" REF="391">
which he got at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> we cut the Timber away. It prov'd a Butt, and was trunnell'd. I cut the Timber about the Trunnel, but let the Trunnel remain. The Butt was wholly open the whole Breadth of the Plank, which was fourteen Inches, and the Water came in with as great Force, as if it was an Engine playing. The Butt was &s;even Tenths of an Inch wide: I run my Hand through to keep the Water out, while I got &s;ome Oakum to &s;top it with: It look'd very frightful, you could &s;ee the Sea plain through it: I got &s;ome Oakum in, and then I went to work to &s;ecure the Butt, which I did thus:</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd to you before, that I left the Trun|nel &s;tanding in the Plank, in which it was very fa&s;t: I notch'd it, and took a Line, and al&s;o two Clove Hitches, with two Parts of the Line, having mous'd the Trunnel above the Clove Hitches, to &s;ecure them from &s;liding, and having fa&s;ten'd the Line &s;o that I had four &s;ingle Parts, and a Noo&s;e, I la&s;h'd the Trunnel to a Bar, as a Port is u&s;ually la&s;h'd; then having two Screws, &s;uch as are us'd in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to fix into the To|bacco Hog&s;heads to rowl them with, from whence, by our Sailors, they are call'd Rowlers: The&s;e Screws I &s;crew'd very fa&s;t at each Corner of the Plank End, and la&s;h'd them well into the Bar, &s;o that I believe the Butt End was as &s;ecure, as it was before I cut the Timber; after which I could venture to drive my Oakum tight; on that I laid Oakum and Tar, and on that a Chock of Wood, &s;ecur'd down with Battings nail'd over, &s;o that it was &s;o tight you could &s;carce perceive it to weep; after which our Ship held it bravely, con&s;idering, till we got to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but a little while after the &s;topping of this Leak, we had another Mis|fortune, which was almo&s;t as bad as our Leaks, which was, the want of Pump Nails; for the
<PB N="383" REF="392">
Sand working up in the Pumps, &s;o tore the Lea|ther, that before we had run half Way to <HI>Bar|badoes,</HI> our Stock of Nails was expended, and they were at their Wits Ends; for it would have been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to have kept her free by baleing alone without the Pumps; I remember'd I had &s;een a Contrivance on Board of a <HI>Frenchman</HI> to make Canvas &s;erve in the room of Leather; our Nece&s;&s;ity oblig'd &punc;us to improve that Contri|vance, for they us'd Nails, we had none to u&s;e: I did at length contrive &s;o, that we fix'd the Boxes to work without Leather or Nails, except|ing the Clappers; and our Canvas Bags did ex|traordinary well, and deliver'd as much more Wa|ter, as when the Boxes were leather'd; but it de|&s;troy'd a great deal of Canvas, which I believe was owing to the Sand which work'd up in the Pump, and cut and fretted the Canvas.</P>
<P>We got to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and anchor'd in <HI>Carli&s;le-Bay Chri&s;tmas-Day,</HI> 1724: We were forc'd to land every thing, and hove her down, &s;hifted be|tween two and three hundred Foot of Plank, &s;he was &s;o eat with the Worms.</P>

<P>_THESE I&s;lands were fir&s;t di&s;covered by the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> but I could not learn from the Natives the exact Time, nor by whom; but there were then no Inhabitants on any of them, nor Cattle of any Kind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;ettled fir&s;t on St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which is not only the large&s;t of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, but the mo&s;t fruitful: from whence, in proce&s;s of Time, they Peopled mo&s;t of the others; &s;ome of which, they were forced to quit again for want of Su&s;tenance, occa&s;ioned by extreme Droughts, and want of Rain, which rendered them &s;o barren, that of late a great many Souls were fami&s;hed to Death: This Drought has con|tinued for this Sixteen or Seventeen Years at <HI>Bona</HI>

<HI>Vi&s;t,</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and longer at the I&s;le of <HI>Sal;</HI> and none of them of late have had the rainy Sea&s;ons &s;o kind as formerly; but the high Lands have always the mo&s;t; and the Natives will tell you, That the Mountains draw, and gather the Clouds together, 'till they are &s;o ponderous, that the Air being unable to bear their Weight any longer, they break and fall down in Rain; but the low I&s;lands, &s;uch as <HI>Sal, Bona Vi&s;t, May,</HI> &amp;c. not having &s;uch high Mountains to detain and gather the Clouds together, they blow over, which, they &s;ay, occa&s;ioned the Drought there, more than at the other I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;ettled on the&s;e I&s;lands, and particularly on that of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> had Slaves from <HI>Guinea;</HI> and, as it was an u&s;ual thing with them (and is continued to this pre&s;ent Time) when a Man or Woman died, to &s;et one or more of their Slaves free, which they do as a meritorious Act of Atonement for their Sins; and the Climate being more agreeable to the Con&s;titutions of tho&s;e Blacks, than to the <HI>European Portugue&s;e,</HI> they in|crea&s;ed much fa&s;ter, and found Means to get them&s;elves tran&s;ported to the neighbouring I&s;lands, where they could live more free from the Op|pre&s;&s;ions of the Whites, who u&s;ed them after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> proud and lording Manner, which did not &s;o well agree with tho&s;e but lately manumitted Blacks; and as they improved in tho&s;e I&s;lands, &s;ome of the Whites &s;ettled there al&s;o; but after the Trade to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> became common to other Nations, and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Trade declined, and dwindled away, as at this Day, to a Trifle, to what it was at fir&s;t; the Blacks all the Time increa&s;ing more than the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> they claimed an equal Degree of Liberty and Freedom with their Ma&s;ters, who thereupon mo&s;tly returned either to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> or to <HI>Portugal;</HI>
<PB N="388" REF="397">
and tho&s;e that remained, were both poor, and few, and were then nece&s;&s;itated to allow the Blacks, if not to be their Superiors, yet, at lea&s;t, to be their Equals; and marrying with them, the &s;uc|ceeding Generations became by that Mixture, from Mallattoes, to Copper-coloured Negroes; &s;o that now you &s;hall &s;ee as great Variety of Negroes on tho&s;e I&s;lands, as is contained on the whole Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> claiming the&s;e I&s;lands by Right of fir&s;t Di&s;covery, as &s;oon as he found them thus inhabited, gave them to &s;uch of his Lords, as he thought fit, excepting St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and, of late, St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, which are governed by Men commi&s;&s;ioned by him, who are commonly <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> born; e&s;pecially the Governor of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> who is dignified with the Title of General Gover|nor of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> from <HI>Rio Senegal,</HI> to <HI>Sierra Leon,</HI> &amp;c. Tho&s;e Lords put a Stock of Cows and Goats on their re&s;pective I&s;lands; and he who is con&s;tituted that Lord's Steward, is called Governor by the Natives, but hath no Power of puni&s;hing, either by Fine, Limb, or Death; the Governor of St. <HI>Jago</HI> only having that Power; but &s;ince the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Office of an <HI>Ovidore,</HI> which is much the &s;ame with the Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize here in <HI>England,</HI> the civil Power is wholly lodged in him, as well as the In&s;pection and Management of the Crown Revenues, &amp;c. the Governor only ordering and managing the Martial Affairs.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the I&s;le of <HI>SAL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS is the Windwardmo&s;t of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, and &s;ituated in Latitude 17&deg;-00# North, and Longitude 5&deg;-18# We&s;t, from the <HI>Cape de Verd.</HI> It is pretty clean all round, having no Shoals nor Rocks, and affords pretty good Roads to ride in, except in the rainy Sea&s;on: The mo&s;t noted whereof is <HI>Palmera,</HI> which is al&s;o the Town, and makes, as it were, Two Bays, there being a Rocky Point in the Middle.</P>
<P>This Bay lies on the We&s;t Side of the I&s;land, and is ea&s;ily known by Three Palm Trees which give Denomination to it, and are &s;till &s;tanding there, and the only ones on the I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="399">
Bring them Ea&s;t-and-by-North of you, and run in 'till the little I&s;land (which lies to the Southward of the Bay, about a Mile, or Half a League, and is always white with Fowls Dung, as if it had been covered with Snow) bears South-We&s;t, which is the be&s;t of the Road; you may, with a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, turn up into the Northern Bay, and Anchor any where in Three, or Three Fathom and a Half.</P>
<P>After you are about <HI>Raabadejhunk,</HI> it &s;hews like a fine Bay, but it's all foul Ground; but af|ter you are about the Point of <HI>Morderea,</HI> you may anchor any where in the Bay of that Name, in what Depth of Water you plea&s;e, it being all clean Ground, where you may fill Water by &s;etting an empty Cask into the Sand a little Way up from the Sea; there are &s;everal Bays where &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els may anchor at, but the&s;e are the Principal.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is mo&s;tly low Land, having only Five Hills, that to the North being the highe&s;t, and that to the Ea&s;t, next; both which, appear in the Form of Sugar Loaves.</P>
<P>This I&s;land formerly abounded with Goats, Cows, and A&s;&s;es; But about the Year 1705, &s;oon after which I went a&s;hore upon it, it was intirely de&s;erted, for want of Rain, by all the Inhabitants, except one old Man, who re&s;olved to die on it, as he did the &s;ame Year; and the Drought was &s;o extreme before this, for &s;ome Time, that mo&s;t of the Cows and Goats died for want of Su&s;tenance; but the Stock not being quite extingui&s;hed, and Rain coming, they again increa&s;ed apace, 'till about Three Years after|wards, a <HI>French</HI> Ship arriving there to catch Turtle, which come to this I&s;land in great Num|bers, and bringing with him about Thirty Hands from the I&s;land of St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> in order to
<PB N="391" REF="400">
catch and cure the &s;ame; whether he was put from his Anchor by Stre&s;s of Weather, or by what other Means, they could never hear; but he left them there, and they having nothing el&s;e to eat, fed mo&s;tly on wild Goats, 'till they had de&s;troyed them all but one, which is now on the I&s;land, and is an old He-Goat, and mo&s;tly keeps upon the Northern Mountain: They killed al&s;o mo&s;t of the Cows, and were at la&s;t forced to eat A&s;&s;es; and &s;o they impoveri&s;hed the I&s;land of its Cattle again.</P>
<P>After they had continued there about Six|teen Months, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, bound for the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> to take in Salt, &s;eeing the Smoak of &s;everal Fires which they made, &s;ent his Boat a&s;hore, thinking it might be &s;ome Ship's Company that was Ship-wreck'd on the I&s;land; and under|&s;tanding who they were, &amp;c. took them all in, and &s;et them to their own I&s;land of St. <HI>Antonio;</HI> and this I was informed of by one of the &s;aid Blacks.</P>
<P>When I brought the Blacks off, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1722, there was then, as the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Blacks told me, Nine Cows and Bulls, and that old He-Goat above mentioned, which they had &s;everal Times &s;een, and a great many A&s;&s;es; but not nigh the Number that was before the Drought.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the I&s;le of <HI>Sal</HI> yields nothing of Ve|getables for Food, &s;ave a little Fe&s;hoon that was &s;own &s;ome few Years ago at <HI>Palmera</HI> in the Valley, which thrives there very well: They &s;hed in <HI>October</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> and the Ground in the Val|ley at that Time being &s;oft, they lie till the &s;pringing Time, and then &s;pring up again, and laying hold of the adjacent Silk Cotton Trees, they climb up like our Hops in <HI>England,</HI> and are fit to eat about <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> the Silk Cotton Tree, you may find very exactly de&s;cribed by Captain
<PB N="392" REF="401">
<HI>Dampier;</HI> but I do not know of any U&s;e it &s;erves for, &s;ave, that in the I&s;lands of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> St. <HI>Phi|lip,</HI> St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and St. <HI>Anto|nio;</HI> they fill Beds of it, as we do with Feathers in <HI>England;</HI> and it makes the be&s;t Tinder of any thing that I know of in the World; and the Wood makes a quick, but not a durable Fire, and when well dried, by Friction will &s;uddenly take Fire.</P>
<P>The Dates that are produced here, are as good as any on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa;</HI> but there is but one of the Three Palm Trees that bears Fruit.</P>
<P>For about a Month after the Rains, there is a running Brook of fre&s;h Water in the Valley of <HI>Palmera;</HI> but then it dries up: However, 'till after <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> you may commonly get fre&s;h Wa|ter there, by digging a Well a little above the Palm or Date Trees.</P>
<P>There is abundance of Land Crabs thereabouts, like tho&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing in this Place concerning the Turtle, and the Manner of catching and &s;aving it, referring my Reader to what I have mentioned on that Head in my Account of taking the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Men off this I&s;land, 1722.</P>
<P>All about the I&s;land, abounds with many Sorts of Fi&s;h; and one Sort, by the Blacks called <HI>Mear,</HI> being about the Bigne&s;s of a Cod, but thicker, and much flatter, and will take Salt, and cure as well as Cod; where, I am &s;ure, a Ship might get a Cargo of Fi&s;h, much &s;ooner than they could at <HI>New-found-Land;</HI> and, for ought I know, might do as well to &s;ell, e&s;pecially at <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> and be caught with le&s;s Charge, Salt being &s;o nigh; and a Man might have Blacks from St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> or St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> who are very dextrous, both at catch|ing, as al&s;o at &s;plitting, &s;alting, and curing, as well Fi&s;h, as Turtle.</P>

<HEAD>Of the I&s;land of <HI>BONA VISTA;</HI> or, <HI>GOOD SIGHT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO called by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands di&s;covered by them. The Body of this I&s;land lies in 16&deg;-10# N. Latitude; and in 5&deg;-14# We&s;t Longitude, from the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> on the main Continent of <HI>Guinea;</HI> its Length the longe&s;t Way, which lies South-Ea&s;t, and North-We&s;t, is Eight Leagues, and Breadth, North-Ea&s;t and South-We&s;t, where it's broade&s;t, about Fifteen Miles.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, about Thirty or Forty Years ago, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fertile&s;t of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, for Cows, Goats, Hogs, Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, Maiz, Pompion, Fe&s;hoon, Water Melon, and Potatoes; of which la&s;t Sort, I heard an old Man relate, that about Forty Years ago, the Go|vernor of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> among &s;ome other Pre&s;ents, which he &s;ent by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship that loaded Salt there, and was to touch (as mo&s;t Ships do that trade in that Commodity) at St. <HI>Jago</HI> for Water, &s;ent a Potatoe of that Bigne&s;s, that I thought in|credible; but the Simplicity of the Relator, as well as that he had no Inducement, that I know of, to move him to &s;tretch it farther than the Truth, makes me apt to believe the Relation; which was, That the Potatoe was &s;o big, that they were forced to &s;ling it with a Rope, and two Men to carry it on a Hand-&s;pike, as Brewers carry a Barrel of Beer.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="403">
But at this Time, there are no Potatoes grow there, and very little of any thing el&s;e; the Cows are likewi&s;e all de&s;troyed, except about Forty, which belong to the Lord of the Soil, who was the old Marque&s;s <HI>das Minhas;</HI> but &s;ince his Death, 'twas given by the King to &s;ome other <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> Nobleman: But &s;ince this, Captain <HI>Ma|nuel Domingo</HI> got an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship to bring him a young Heifer, and a young Bull, which he bought of him; and when I was la&s;t there with Captain <HI>Harfoot,</HI> he told me his Stock was increa&s;ed to Seven.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Inhabitants have Goats; the Milk of which, &s;ince the Famine, is a great Part of their Su&s;tenance, as Fi&s;h and Turtle are another; their whole Dependance for the re&s;t, is on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships that come there to lade Salt, who often times hire &s;ome of them to work in the Salt Pans, and likewi&s;e are forced to hire A&s;&s;es, and Blacks to drive them, to bring the Salt down to the Sea Side to &s;hip off; for which they pay them in Bisket, Flower, &amp;c. or old Cloaths, or what el&s;e they bring with them for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>They u&s;ed to have a pretty good Trade for their A&s;&s;es and Hor&s;es, which are the be&s;t of all that are upon the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, which they &s;old for Cloaths, Provi&s;ions, and Money, when they could get it, or that their Nece&s;&s;ities for Food were not &s;o great.</P>
<P>Raw Silk is much coveted by them, for work|ing the Bo&s;oms of their Shirts, Shifts, Caps, Womens Wa&s;te-coats, and Coifs, which they do very dextrou&s;ly, con&s;idering.</P>
<P>The Men generally u&s;e the <HI>European</HI> Dre&s;s, and few but what have Suits of Cloaths bought of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and have learned to make Cotton Cloths to imitate the <HI>European</HI> Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="404">
The Women, when dre&s;&s;ed, have Cotton Cloths; and, according as they are indu&s;trious or nice in &s;pinning, &s;ome finer, &s;ome coar&s;er, &s;ome with One, &s;ome Two or Three of tho&s;e Cloths wrapped about them like Petticoats, and tied with a Girdle above the Hips, or &s;ometimes without a Girdle, the Corner of the Cloth only tucked in; their Shifts are made like a Man's Shirt, but cut off &s;o &s;hort, that it don't reach low enough to tye under their Girdle; the Wri&s;t-bands, Collar, and Neck, of the highe&s;t Sort, e&s;pecially the younger, are wrought in Figures, with Silk of divers Colours, with the Needle; but the poorer, particularly the older Sort, content them&s;elves with blew Cotton Thread to work their Bo&s;oms, Collars, &amp;c. with; over their Shifts they wear a Wa&s;te-coat, with Sleeves to button at the Arms, not above Four Inches deep in the back Part, but long enough before, to tye with Strings under their Brea&s;ts; and over all, a Cotton Cloth, in manner of a Mantle; which the married Women generally have of a blue Colour, and the darker the Blue, the richer it's reckoned; but the Maidens and gay young Wives, or Widows, wear blue and white Cloths, &s;ome figured, as they call it, others &s;potted: Some are &s;o nice as to have white Cotton; but rather, if they can get them, Linnen Handkerchiefs wrought along the Edges, and &s;ometimes the Corners only, with Silk, mo&s;tly red, green, and blue, the fir&s;t being the Colour mo&s;t admired among them, as well as by all the Inhabitants of tho&s;e I&s;lands in general, the latter being the only Colour they can dye, which they vary to &s;everal Degrees, by making it darker or lighter.</P>
<P>The Women wear no Shoes nor Stockings, ex|cept very few of them, and that only on Holidays; but &s;ome of the Men are &s;o u&s;ed to Shoes and
<PB N="396" REF="405">
Stockings, that they can as little bear to go bare|foot, as we in <HI>England;</HI> but I think there is not above Two or Three of tho&s;e upon this I&s;land.</P>
<P>But though this be the Manner of their Dre&s;&s;ing on Holidays, yet, on other Days, both Men and Women are mo&s;tly naked, the Women only wear|ing a &s;mall Cotton Cloth wrapped round them as high as their Wa&s;te, and reaching down to their Knees, or a little lower, and the Men a Pair of old Breeches, which, if there be but the Wa&s;te|band, and a Piece hanging to it before to hide their Privities, it's reckoned &s;ufficient; or, for want of this, they wear the Remnants of an old Wa&s;te-coat, hanging all in Tatters about them; and were they the be&s;t Cloaths in the World, they will not &s;o much as &s;ew a Seam, if ripped.</P>
<P>They are very lazy, both Men and Women; and though this I&s;land yields more Cotton than all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands be&s;ide, yet there is not one I&s;land where there are fewer Cotton Cloths to be bought, or dearer &s;old, than this of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t;</HI> for they will neither gather the Cotton 'till they know of a Ship or Ve&s;&s;el to buy it, nor will their Women &s;pin, but as they want; &s;o that if a Man &s;hould go there when the Cotton Sea&s;on is over, he will &s;carce be able to buy One hundred weight on the I&s;land, though, I am certain, they might gather yearly more than a good Ship's Cargo, Cotton Shrubs growing there in common: And though at &s;everal of the I&s;lands, Cotton, of late Years, hath failed, yet, at <HI>Bona Vi&s;t</HI> it never failed yet, and with little Charge, might be turned into <HI>Guinea</HI> trading Cloaths; &s;o that it might be no difficult Matter for a Man to have One or Two thou&s;and Barrafools (i. e. trading Cloths) in a very little Time, for Six-pence or Eight-pence <HI>per</HI> Barrafool, which, in our Mea&s;ure, is about Five Foot and a Half long, and Four Foot broad;
<PB N="397" REF="406">
but each I&s;land has its different Mea&s;ure, and this Quantity, at any Time and Place where Cotton Cloths vend (which is on a con&s;iderable Part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea)</HI> would purcha&s;e at lea&s;t, One hundred Slaves, or other Commodities proportionable; and &s;ometimes half the Quantity more.</P>
<P>This I&s;land likewi&s;e yields Plenty of Indigo, which grows as the Cotton does, naturally, they taking no other Pains with it, but to gather it when they have Occa&s;ion for it. They have not the Way of &s;eparating the Tincture, as is practi&s;ed in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &amp;c. which, if they had, and were indu&s;trious, there might be a great deal made there; and I do not know, but it might be worth while to bring it to <HI>England,</HI> even as they make it up, which is only by pounding the Leaves of the Shrub, while green, in a wooden Mortar, with a wooden Pe&s;tle, &s;uch as they u&s;e to pound their Maiz in (for they have no kind of Mills to grind with on any of the I&s;lands) and &s;o reduce it to a kind of Pap, which they form into thick round Cakes, &s;ome into Balls, and drying it, keep it 'till they have Occa&s;ion to u&s;e it for dying their Cloths.</P>
<P>I remember when I was at that I&s;land &s;ome Years ago, I bought Six or Eight of the&s;e Cakes for a Tryal, and when I came home, I gave them to a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who car|ried them home to his Wife, telling her, It was Indigo unrefined, which &s;he endeavouring to u&s;e for the blueing of her Linnen and Starch, could not extract the Tincture in the u&s;ual Way, and &s;o hove it away as good for nothing: I did expect he would have carried it to &s;ome one that knew how to extract the Tincture out of it, &s;o as to have been able, with &s;ome Exactne&s;s, to know what Quantity of Tincture, or, as it's commonly
<PB N="398" REF="407">
called, Stone-blue, might be contained in &s;uch a Quantity of tho&s;e Cakes, and from thence to compute whether it was worth while to trade for it there; I not knowing then my&s;elf how to make that Experiment, which I have &s;ince learned of the Natives of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who extract the Tin|cture by a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> though, I doubt not, but that there may be better Ways than that.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall Quantity of Ambergris found here, but the Inhabitants, for the mo&s;t Part, adulterate it, by mixing with it a Sort of Jelly or Excrement ca&s;t on the Shore there; &s;o that it's not worth buying, unle&s;s by one that could di&s;tingui&s;h that which is adulterated, from that which is not.</P>
<P>This I&s;land abounds with Fi&s;h, but not near &s;o plenty as at the I&s;land of <HI>Sal,</HI> though I have my&s;elf haled at one Draught with a Seyn, Fifty-&s;ix Mul|lets, be&s;ides a va&s;t Quantity of other Fi&s;h; and about the Rock which lies off from the I&s;land called <HI>John Letton,</HI> Fi&s;h are as plenty, as at the I&s;land afore-mentioned.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is low Land for the mo&s;t Part, with &s;ome rocky Mountains and &s;andy Hills; the Coa&s;t on the Ea&s;t Side &s;andy, and from the South-Ea&s;t Point, round to the Southward, and from thence to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Road, the Coa&s;t is all &s;andy, mo&s;tly of a whiti&s;h Ca&s;t, except here and there &s;ome black rocky Cliffs.</P>
<P>There are but Two Roads u&s;ed by Ships in this I&s;land; the mo&s;t noted is <HI>The Engli&s;h Road,</HI> which lies to the Southward of the <HI>little I&s;land.</HI> It is a large clean Bay, with &s;everal little Shoals which &s;pit out from the Northermo&s;t Side of the Bay; and you may anchor any where from Thir|teen to Four Fathom, but not within that Depth, for fear of the afore&s;aid &s;tony Shoals: There is a Rock which extends South-We&s;t from the South

Point of the <HI>little I&s;land</HI> about a Mile, which is &s;teep clo&s;e to the Side of the <HI>little I&s;land;</HI> but el&s;e all round about it are gradual and &s;andy Shoalings. The Channel between this Rock, and the <HI>little I&s;land,</HI> is clean, and near the Rock is Nine Fathom; but as you are nigher the I&s;land, it &s;hoals gradually till you come into Five Fathom, which is nigh enough to venture: The be&s;t Riding is to bring the South Point of the <HI>little I&s;land</HI> North-We&s;t, and anchor in Five Fathom Water.</P>
<P>The other Road is called, <HI>The Portugue&s;e Road,</HI> which, though it is nothing nigh &s;o good as the <HI>Engli&s;h Road</HI> for landing, yet it lies nigher the Town, and is clean, having nothing to hurt you but the Shore, after you are to the Southward of the Shoals of <HI>Calyete St. George,</HI> till you come to the South-Ea&s;t Point, &s;aving, that you mu&s;t give the North-We&s;t Point of the Bay a &s;mall Birth, the Point running flat out a little way.</P>
<P>The Rock of <HI>John Letton,</HI> lies from <HI>Calyete St. George,</HI> South-We&s;t, about Five Leagues, from whence, in clear Weather, you may &s;ee <HI>Bona Vi&s;t;</HI> the ragged Mountain over the Town, which is the only one on that I&s;land, bears from the Rock North-Ea&s;t-Ea&s;terly; the North-Ea&s;t End of the Rock is above the Water, and &s;hews about the Bigne&s;s and Height of a light Ship of Two or Three hundred Tuns Burthen; and is &s;teep too on the North-Ea&s;t End, &s;tretching away We&s;t-South-We&s;t, and Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, about half a League in Length.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed over the We&s;t-South-We&s;t End of it, in Ten Fathom Water; I could then &s;ee the Bottom very plain, which was rocky, and I could di&s;cern Swarms of Fi&s;h; I lay to, as &s;oon as I was clear of it, it being a fine light Gale, and &s;mooth Water; and in le&s;s than a Quarter of an Hour, we got as much Fi&s;h as we could tell what

<P>The People of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> naturally love the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and mo&s;t of them can &s;peak a little of the <HI>Engli&s;h Tongue,</HI> and even &s;ome of the Women make &s;hift to under&s;tand one in it.</P>

<P>The North, and North-Ea&s;t Parts of this I&s;land, are very rocky, and full of Shoals; &s;ome lying off the Land a good Way; the mo&s;t dangerous, is a Ledge of Rocks which extends from the North-Ea&s;t Side the Length of a League, and at low Water is almo&s;t dry in &s;ome Places: Between that and the Shore, is a Channel, where is Water

<P>There are Two Roads for Ships to ride in, and &s;everal little Coves, where a Boat might run in; but I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf, nor my Reader, with the De&s;cription of the latter.</P>
<P>The Northermo&s;t Road is called <HI>Paa Seco,</HI> where you may anchor in Six, Seven, or Eight Fathom Water, bringing the Ea&s;termo&s;t Point of the Bay North-We&s;t of you; the Ground is &s;tony, but doth not much damage a Cable, except you chance to fall among the Coral Rocks; but letting go your Anchor in Seven or Eight Fathom, and the Point North-We&s;t, or North-We&s;t-by-North, you will have the be&s;t of the Road. The Coa&s;t down along almo&s;t to the Point of <HI>Yingdo&s;t,</HI> is full of &s;tony Shoals and Banks; &s;ome of them extend near Two Miles from the Shore.</P>
<P>About the Point of <HI>Yingdo&s;t,</HI> lies the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Road, where the Salt Ships ride; 'Tis mo&s;tly foul Ground, and rocky towards the <HI>Bluff Point,</HI> which makes the South Point of the Bay. The North|ermo&s;t Part of the Bay is almo&s;t as bad for cutting a Cable, but not liable to hook an Anchor, as the South Side is, by rea&s;on of the Rocks. 'Tis generally &s;aid, That the <HI>We&s;t-of-England-Men</HI> fouled this Bay, by heaving their Stone Balla&s;t over-board in it. The Middle of the Bay is the cleare&s;t Ground, and from Twelve to Eight Fathom, the be&s;t Depth to ride in, except in the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> or <HI>July,</HI> when you ex|pect &s;hifting Winds, and then it's better riding out in Fifteen or Eighteen Fathom.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> but not altogether &s;o well affected to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They have run the &s;ame Calamity for want of Rain, $s tho&s;e of <HI>Bona Vi&s;t,</HI> but have more Cows, and the&s;e generally the be&s;t and fatte&s;t

<P>This I&s;land of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> on the South-Ea&s;t End, is flat Land, but all the re&s;t, except <HI>Campo de Terra-fall,</HI> is mo&s;tly mountainous; the highe&s;t is <HI>Peek Antonio,</HI> which is near the Middle of the I&s;land, and may be &s;een above the re&s;t of the Mountains on either Side of the I&s;land, at the Di&s;tance of three or four Leagues off; at a le&s;s Di&s;tance than which, the other Mountains inter|cept your Sight.

<P>The City lies about a League to the North-We&s;tward, in a very ordinary Road, being &s;o very foul, that it's much but you cut your Cable, if you lie any Time; or, if you mi&s;s that, you may probably &s;o hook your Anchor in the Rocks, that ten to one but you leave it behind you.</P>
<P>There have &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els been lo&s;t in this Road, which is the Rea&s;on that of late few Ships go there, unle&s;s by chance a <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> though formerly &s;ome of the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t India</HI> Ships have touch'd there for Refre&s;hment and for Water, which runs into the Sea there; but for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, <HI>Porto Praya</HI> hath been only us'd, where is good Watering al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Rivera de Plata</HI> is a very good Bay, all over clean Ground, where you may anchor in what Depth you plea&s;e, from three and a half to twelve or fourteen Fathom Water, and is a better Place
<PB N="411" REF="420">
to water at than <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> the Water running down to the Sea-&s;ide, where you may rowl your Cask into the River, and fill your Water at the Bung, without u&s;ing Bucket or Funnel. You may have all Sorts of Refre&s;hment at this Bay, as Fruit, Roots, Fowls, Goats, and Cows, much cheaper than you can buy them either at <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> or the City; and I have known when a Cow has been &s;old at <HI>Porto Praya</HI> for eight Dol|lars, which is 6000 Reas, that a much better has been &s;old at <HI>Rivera de Plata</HI> for 2500 Reas; and when Maiz has been &s;old at <HI>Porto Praya</HI> for 400, it has, at the &s;ame Time, been &s;old there for 200 Reas.</P>
<P><HI>Terra-fall</HI> is the next con&s;iderable Port, which, although it's a good Road when in, except in the &s;hifting Winds Sea&s;on, yet it's very trouble&s;ome to turn up into, and a Place that yields no Commo|dities for Trade.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Porto Faciendo,</HI> which is a fair large Bay, being clean, thwart the Beach, from ten to four Fathom Water. You may al&s;o fill Water here; but this Part of the I&s;land being mo&s;tly Pa&s;ture Land, you can have little other Refre&s;hment, &s;ave Goats and Cows, which you may have as cheap as on any Part of the I&s;land. I remember I bought a young Bull, about two Years and half old, for an old Shirt, which was not worth Sixpence in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>You may have Monkeys here, and on all Parts of this I&s;land; which of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands alone produces that Creature.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Coves and little Bays betwixt this Road and the <HI>Bickude,</HI> which is the Norther|mo&s;t Point of St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but the Place is not only barren and uninhabited, but dangerous to venture in, the Coa&s;t all along being rocky, &s;ome under,
<PB N="412" REF="421">
other&s;ome above Water; but don't lie above a Mile off from the Shore.</P>
<P>After you are about the <HI>Bickude,</HI> the Coa&s;t runs to the Southward of <HI>Porto &s;ine Nome,</HI> which I &s;hall pa&s;s by any farther De&s;cription of, as hav|ing had occa&s;ion to mention it before.</P>
<P>The next Bay is <HI>Porto Formo&s;a,</HI> which is a fair Bay, being mud up at the Head of it round the Point, where a &s;mall Shallop might lie Landlock'd from all Winds; but not being convenient for Trade, I pa&s;s to the next Port; which is</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jago;</HI> which is remarkable enough to be known, there being a Church, the Out&s;ide of which is whited with Lime, and cover'd with red Pantiles, and &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing Ground, and therefore &s;een at a great Di&s;tance. It's thwart the Middle of the Bay, and has a Valley both on the South and North Side of the Church, well planted with Cocoa-Nut and Palm Trees. The Bay is clean &s;andy Ground, and a Ship may &s;afe|ly anchor in ten or twelve Fathom Water. A little to the Northward of the Church there com|monly runs a great Sea along Shore, which is &s;andy.</P>
<P>This is one of the plentifulle&s;t Places on St. <HI>Jago,</HI> for what&s;oever Things the I&s;land produces; and the People are very free, &s;omewhat like the Temper of tho&s;e of the I&s;le of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>South-by-Ea&s;t, about two or three Miles, lies the <HI>Porto Madera:</HI> It's narrow going in, being not above a large Stone's-ca&s;t wide, between two rocky Points; but &s;teep too on both Sides, having nine, eight, &s;even, &s;ix Fathom Water in; and after you are &s;hot in about the Northermo&s;t Point, you have four, and further in, three Fathom and half. You are then Landlock'd for all Winds, and can &s;ee no Sea, and may &s;ecure a Ship of three hundred Tons with a three Inch Rope; for
<PB N="413" REF="422">
let the Wind blow which Way it will, you have very little when in. Its Bottom is Sand, mixt with Clay; but higher up it's &s;oft Mud: It is a very good Harbour, when in, and neither dan|gerous, nor difficult, there being nothing to hurt you going in, &s;o you don't run a&s;hore again&s;t the Rocks: It's difficult for a Stranger to find it, be|cau&s;e one Point locks or &s;huts in the other &s;o, that you can't perceive the Harbour till you are pa&s;t it, nor any thing remarkable enough to know it by: The only way for a Stranger to run into it, would be, to take in one of the Natives on Board at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> to &s;hew him the Port.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Bays betwixt <HI>Porto Madera</HI> and <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> but a little dangerous, having many &s;unken Rocks lying along the Coa&s;t, but not any farther off the Shore than one Mile, nei|ther are they fit for Ships to ride in.</P>
<P><HI>Porto Lobo</HI> is a very &s;afe Harbour, when in, for all Winds: The Entrance is but narrow, not above half a Cable's Length broad, with &s;everal &s;unken Rocks lying on each Side of the Entrance, which makes it too dangerous to venture into it without a Pilot, or unle&s;s a Man had been in be|fore: When you are in, it &s;hews as if you were got into a Ba&s;on or Lake, being about three Quarters of a Mile every way; but you have not above twelve or fourteen Foot Water within, ex|cept under the Northermo&s;t Point, where you have eighteen or twenty Foot. It's all muddy Ground till you run up to the Bottom of the Lake, and then it is Sand. A little to the North|ward of <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> the mountainous Land of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Jago</HI> terminates, and, except &s;ome Hills, is flat; yet mo&s;tly high champion Land down to <HI>Porto Praya.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="423">
Betwixt <HI>Porto Lobo</HI> and <HI>Praya,</HI> is the Road of St. <HI>Franci&s;co;</HI> which is a fair &s;andy Bay, with Cocoa Nut and Palm Trees in the Valley, but is foul Ground in mo&s;t Places of the Bay; neither is there any fre&s;h Water there nigh the Sea.</P>
<P>About a League to the South-We&s;tward from St. <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> is a Cove call'd <HI>Portet,</HI> being a good Road for Shallops, or &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, but not fit for great Ships: There lies a &s;unken Rock about two thirds on the Starboard Side going in.</P>
<P>The next Road is <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> which was de|&s;crib'd before.</P>
<P>There is Abundance of that Marcha&s;ite which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call <HI>Beur d'ore,</HI> &s;ome of which is a little tran&s;parent, and other&s;ome more opake, being in the Shade of a dark bluei&s;h or purple Colour; but when the Sun-beams are reflected upon it, ca&s;ts a golden gli&s;tering Colour; and I have heard &s;ome Gentlemen, who had re&s;ided &s;ome time in &s;everal Parts of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and were conver&s;ant with People concern'd in the Mines there, &s;ay, It was an infallible Sign of a Gold Mine, where-ever any great Quantity of that <HI>Beur d'ore</HI> was; and likewi&s;e told me, That the &s;aid purpli&s;h Marcha&s;ite, if ground fine, and mix'd with Oil, made any thing painted with it, look as if it had been gilded; which Experiment I never try'd.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t Red that ever I &s;aw, was on this I&s;land, in a Hill on the North Part of St. <HI>Jago:</HI> It was much after the Manner of the Chalk in <HI>England,</HI> but &s;ofter; and when I &s;crap'd &s;ome of it with a Knife, it felt as fine as the fine&s;t Flower: It run in Veins, and next to the deep, yet lively Red, run a Vein of a fainter Red, then a Vein yet fainter, next to that a Fle&s;h Colour, then a Sort of Yellow, then a Yellow much of the Colour of common Brim&s;tone, after, or above that, variou&s;ly
<PB N="415" REF="424">
colour'd; and &s;o grew harder, the farther from the Red, till it came to the Hardne&s;s of a common Rock. The red Stone was &s;omething heavier than Chalk. I had a Piece of that, and &s;ome of the <HI>Beur d'ore;</HI> but when I lo&s;t my Boat at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> I lo&s;t them, with &s;everal other Curio&s;ities of the like Nature.</P>

<HEAD>The I&s;land of St. <HI>PHILIP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> commonly call'd by the Name of the I&s;land of <HI>Fogo,</HI> or <HI>Fire,</HI> lies about 16 Leagues from St. <HI>Jago, viz.</HI> from the Point of <HI>Terra-fall,</HI> to the North-Ea&s;t Point of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and they bear We&s;t-South-We&s;t and Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, being in the Latitude of 15&deg;-20# North, and Longitude 6&deg;-54# We&s;t from the <HI>Cape de Verd.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land was di&s;cover'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> the &s;ame Day that the I&s;le of <HI>May</HI> and St. <HI>Jago</HI> were, <HI>viz.</HI> the 1&s;t Day of <HI>May;</HI> &s;o that the I&s;le of <HI>May</HI> bore the Name of the Month, and the other two the Name of the two Saints, who&s;e Commemoration is ob&s;erv'd on that Day.</P>
<P>This I&s;land was uninhabited a great many Years after it was di&s;cover'd, till the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> granted to his Subjects, who would people it, all the Land that they improv'd, to them and their Heirs for ever.</P>
<P>The Natives have a Tradition, which how true I &s;hall not undertake to determine, but is by them believ'd as undoubted Fact, that the fir&s;t Dwellers upon this I&s;land were two Fryers, who cho&s;e to be
<PB N="416" REF="425">
put here to pa&s;s the Remainder of their Days in a hermitick Life.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e two Fryers were Minerali&s;ts, Metali&s;ts, or Alchymi&s;ts, or any, or all of them, I can't tell; but the Story goes they were Con|jurers; (You mu&s;t know when this I&s;land was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd, it had no Peek, nor was there any burning upon it, the Peek growing but &s;ince the Fire broke out; and, by Report of the ancient People, hath &s;en&s;ibly increas'd within their Times) but whatever the Fryers were, they found a Gold Mine, and there took up their hermitical Abode; and after they had got as much of that precious Metal as they thought &s;ufficient, they concluded to put an End to a hermitick Life, and take the fir&s;t Opportunity of a Ship to <HI>Europe:</HI> But one of them, who &s;uppos'd him&s;elf the Ma&s;ter, requir'd more than half to his Share, which the other by no Means would grant; whereupon the Conte&s;t grew &s;o high, that they fell to conjuring to do each other a Mi&s;chief; and conjur'd &s;o long, that they &s;et almo&s;t all the I&s;land in a Flame, in which they both peri&s;h'd; after which the Fire went out, except where the Peek now &s;tands, which ever &s;ince hath continu'd to burn and ca&s;t up Stones till this Day, and God knows how long it may continue.</P>
<P>Indeed it is almo&s;t incredible to believe the va&s;t Rocks which are ca&s;t out, and to what a va&s;t Height; the Fall of which again, and their break|ing and rowling down, may very ea&s;ily be heard eight or nine Leagues in a &s;till Air, and this my own Ears confirm'd to me. When they are blown up, you may hear a Report like a great Gun, or rather Thunder. In the Night-time I have &s;een the Stones rowling down the Peek all of a Flame, and the Inhabitants &s;ay, that they have &s;een Brim&s;tone run down the Peek like
<PB N="417" REF="426">
a Torrent of Water down a &s;teep Mountain, and &s;ometimes may gather what Quantity they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have had &s;everal Pieces of it, which the In|habitants gave me: It is like our vulgar Brim&s;tone, but of a much brighter Colour, and, in the burn|ing, gives a brighter Flame.</P>
<P>Sometimes this Vulcano heaves out &s;uch Quan|tities of A&s;hes, mix'd with Cinders, that it covers the adjacent Parts, and hath &s;mother'd &s;ome of their Goats.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is much higher than any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, and is, as it were, one con|tinu'd Mountain up to the Top; neither as you &s;ail along it, can you perceive any Vallies, but, as it were, one &s;ingle Mountain, the Vallies ap|pearing only as Gutters made by the Waters run|ing off the Mountain in the Rains; but when a Man is a&s;hore, and in one of tho&s;e Gutters, they then appear to be deep Vallies, and the Banks of tho&s;e Gutters great high Mountains. This I&s;land, con&s;idering that it hath no running Brooks, and that it is but in very few Places that fre&s;h Water is to be had, in&s;omuch, that the Inhabitants are forced, in &s;ome Parts, to go &s;ix or &s;even Miles for their Water; yet it's very fertile, for Pom|pion, Water-Melon, Fe&s;hoon, and Maiz; but for want of Water, or low Vallies, produces no Banana's, Plantanes, or hardly any Tree-Fruit, &s;ave Wild Figs.</P>
<P>They have &s;ome few Guava Trees planted in &s;ome of their Gardens, al&s;o a Crab Orange and Lemon, likewi&s;e Lime, and a Sort of Crab Ap|ple; but they have here and there &s;ome good Vineyards, whereof they make little Quantities of an indifferent good &s;mall Wine, &s;omething like the white <HI>Fyal</HI> Wine; but they generally
<PB N="418" REF="427">
drink it all before it clears, or has done ferment|ing.</P>
<P>This I&s;land was inhabited by <HI>European Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> &s;ome time after the Fire had been extin|gui&s;h'd, except that of the Peek, and had the Land, by the Crown Gift, &s;ettled to them and their Heirs, as has been &s;aid; which <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> brought Negro Slaves with them, and a Stock of Cows, Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, and Hogs; the King pla|cing Goats there, which run wild on the Moun|tains; the Profit of their Skins being re&s;erv'd to the Crown, and he that hath the Management of them, is call'd <HI>Captain of the Mountains,</HI> none daring to kill any of them but by his Licence.</P>
<P>The Land is all taken up at pre&s;ent, only about the Peek, and that great high Mountain which runs along South-Ea&s;t and North-We&s;t, and is little inferior in Heighth to the Peek, and where, at pre&s;ent, tho&s;e wild Goats haunt, and is the Limits of the <HI>Capiteen de Mountainhu's</HI> Juri&s;|diction.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;toms of St. <HI>Jago</HI> are in u&s;e here, <HI>viz.</HI> to free Blacks at their Death, and perhaps &s;ome manumitted Blacks might &s;ettle there from St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but however it was, they at pre&s;ent exceed the Whites a hundred to one.</P>
<P>It's probable, when Trade decay'd, &s;ome of them might leave the I&s;land, as they had done at St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P>They planted Cotton in abundance; and this was the greate&s;t Mart for Cotton Cloths of any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands; and here the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e European</HI> Ships us'd to trade for Cargoes of Barafools for <HI>Guinea.</HI> The free Blacks, for the mo&s;t Part, are Tenants to the Whites, who have taken up mo&s;t of the Land, e&s;pecially near the Sea; &s;ome Whites having thirty or forty Slaves, and &s;ome of the free Blacks have Slaves,
<PB N="419" REF="428">
which they purcha&s;e for Cotton Cloths, which pa&s;s there in the room of Money, a Cloth being valu'd, and pa&s;&s;ing current among them for 1000 Reas; but by the la&s;t Drought, all their Cotton Shrubs, in a Manner, were dry'd up, &s;o that that Cotton, which was before the chief Product of their I&s;land, is now a good Commodity to carry there: And this Scarcity of Cotton here, and at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and the <HI>European Portugue&s;e</HI> under|&s;tanding that the <HI>French</HI> Ships, which traded there formerly, u&s;ed to buy tho&s;e Cloths, as did like|wi&s;e the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> they procur'd an Order, with a Penalty on any one on the&s;e I&s;lands, who &s;old Cloth to any but Subjects of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which Order is &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd by the Officers of the Cu&s;toms at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> tho' not much minded here, by Rea&s;on there are no Duties paid at this I&s;land, and con&s;equently no Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, or Office.</P>
<P>Since the Trade of Cotton Cloths fail'd, they have &s;old a great many Slaves to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships trading there; but they are endeavouring to revive this Branch again, by planting Cotton; tho', for want of a Sufficiency of Rain, it does not thrive &s;o well as it us'd to do.</P>
<P>They us'd al&s;o to have a pretty good Trade with the <HI>French</HI> for Mules, which they bred in good Quantities, and &s;old cheap; but the dry Sea|&s;ons de&s;troy'd them almo&s;t all, &s;o that they told me, that &s;ix Years ago, there were but two Mules on the I&s;land; but they have lately began to breed them again, and mightily wi&s;h &s;ome <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Ships would come and trade with them for them; but whether it be that the <HI>French</HI> have found a better Place to trade, or that their I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> do not require them now &s;o much as formerly, or that they do not yet know that they can be &s;upply'd as heretofore, I can't
<PB N="420" REF="429">
tell; but &s;ince they have fail'd of Mules, there has been no <HI>French</HI> Ship there to trade.</P>
<P>They have a great De&s;ire to trade with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and would, they &s;ay, re&s;erve their Commodities for them; and notwith&s;tanding the Prohibition of not &s;elling Cotton Cloths to Foreigners, yet they &s;ay if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would trade there, they would &s;ell their Cloths to them.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is clean on the North-We&s;t, We&s;t, and South Parts; but on the South-Ea&s;t, Ea&s;t, and North-Ea&s;t Parts is rocky; tho' the&s;e Rocks do not lie above a Mile from the Shore, neither do they lie thick, but here and there one, &s;ome above, and &s;ome under Water, except one Rock, which lieth about four Miles off from the North End of the I&s;land, having, as I have been in|form'd, twelve or fourteen Foot Water on it. I have &s;een the Sea break over it, when it blew hard, el&s;e not. It's not large, and is clean all round it.</P>
<P>This I&s;land hath not many Places to anchor at, and but two where you can trade; for at the re&s;t, you cannot get up the Rocks; for it's all, except the <HI>Villa La-Ghate,</HI> and two or three other Places on the Sea-coa&s;t, &s;uch &s;teep high rocky Clifts, that you cannot get up any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t noted Road is <HI>Fonte de Villa,</HI> which is right again&s;t the Town, and is &s;andy, except when a &s;trong North Wind blows, which often &s;weeps or &s;cours away the Sand, and leaves the Rocks at Bottom bare, which is about <HI>November, December,</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> and then 'tis not &s;o &s;afe riding as about the Point of <HI>No&s;&s;a Singora,</HI> which is a &s;andy Point, to the Southward of the Town; to the Southward of which, on the Clift, is the Church of <HI>No&s;&s;a Singora,</HI> from which the Bay and Point took their Name. Here is good riding for a Nor|therly Wind, and better when the true North-Ea&s;t
<PB N="421" REF="430">
or North-Ea&s;t-by-North Trade Winds blow, being clean and &s;andy at Bottom, except when a &s;outherly Wind blows &s;trong, or &s;ometimes by a &s;outherly Sea, which now and then runs here in the Months of <HI>June, July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> when tho&s;e Winds do not reach home to the I&s;land, tho', I believe, they blow in the Offing, which &s;weep away the Sand, and leave the Rocks bare at Bottom, as the Northerly Wind and Sea do at <HI>Fonte de Villa.</HI></P>
<P>You may anchor in both tho&s;e Roads, from 14 to 10 Fathom Water, in clean &s;andy Ground, except in the Ca&s;es before mention'd. More Southerly there is a little &s;andy Bay about a &s;mall Point of low broken Rocks, and right again&s;t a Gully made by the Water running down in the Time of the Rains: Here is &s;mooth riding, as well as landing, the Surff running but little here; and you have Water pretty near, which you have not at the other two Places; and the Sea generally runs there with a great Swell on the Shore.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t anchor right off the Gully, having it fair open; for if you &s;hut it either to the North|ward, or Southward, and anchor &s;o, you will have foul Ground; neither is there Room for above two Ships to anchor there at once.</P>
<P>The chief and only Man for Trade there, is Captain <HI>Thome Santee;</HI> but there is not one on the I&s;land, that can either &s;peak or under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>They are on this I&s;land all <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, yet have &s;ome Pagan Super&s;titions mingled with the Romi&s;h, by the Mountaineer Blacks. Mo&s;t of the Whites, with the Governor, live in the Villa; tho' mo&s;t of them have their Country Hou&s;es abroad in the Country, on that Part of their E&s;tates which they keep in their own Hands, and manage by their Slaves, which &s;upplies them
<PB N="422" REF="431">
with Food; and the Rents of tho&s;e Plantations which they let to the Blacks, are commonly paid in Cotton Cloths, which, as was &s;aid before, are u&s;ed there in the Stead of Money, as Tobacco was formerly wholly, and now partly, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Maryland;</HI> and &s;ince their Cotton Shrubs were dried up, and for the mo&s;t Part peri&s;hed, the Owners were forced to fill tho&s;e Plantations with Hogs, Fowls, or what other Animals the Blacks could rai&s;e.</P>

<P>It was, for &s;everal Years, only inhabited by Two black Families, who lived wholly in Heathen|i&s;m, 'till, about Sixty Years pa&s;t, a Famine rage|ing at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, &s;ome of the poorer Sort of Blacks procured them&s;elves to be put on the I&s;land of St. <HI>John,</HI> by a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship, who were joyfully received, as well as relieved, by their Fellow Blacks the fir&s;t Inhabitants, who having much increa&s;ed the Stock of Goats, Cows, and e&s;pecially Hogs, which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had placed on all the I&s;lands when they fir&s;t di&s;covered them, tho&s;e fir&s;t Inhabitants, under&s;tanding the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> brought their Fellow Blacks from St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, purely out of Compa&s;&s;ion to prevent their being &s;tarved, freely offered to load the Ship with Hogs, as a Reward for their Charity; which &s;o thinned their Hogs, that by the Time the Ship was loaden, they had but few left, and &s;o they catched and killed, or tamed the Remainder.</P>
<P>The&s;e Blacks which came from St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, &s;oon begot in them the Notion of Property; &s;o that he that could kill, catch, or tame mo&s;t, had mo&s;t; and &s;oon reduced all the Cattle on the I&s;land to <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> except the Goats, which, to this Day, remain wild; but are claimed as the Property of the Lord of the Soil, as are all the wild Goats on the I&s;lands.</P>

<P>They were heard groaning for Three Days after; but the Rocks and great Stones which fell in, and &s;topped their coming forth, could not be moved to let them out; and it was happy for the re&s;t of the Inhabitants, that their Zeal was

bodily Wor&s;hip, &s;tripping her of all at Night, and putting Earth on her Head, in Token of Sub|jection, &s;prinkling the Graves of the Dead with Water, and &s;ometimes with the Juice of Water-Melons, and abundance of other Fooleries.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, as I told you before, is very high, yet being &s;o near the I&s;land of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> it &s;eems, in Compari&s;on of that, to be but low.</P>
<P>It abounds the mo&s;t with Salt-peter, of any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands; and the Governor of|fered to engage him&s;elf to procure me a Cargo &s;uf|ficient to load with it, that Sloop, or even bigger than I lo&s;t there: It grows in &s;everal hollow earthen Caves there, and hangs, or covers all the In&s;ide like a thick hoar Fro&s;t, and, in &s;ome Places, in Strias like I&s;icles; and in &s;ome hollow Rocks, and rocky Caves in great Strias, as thick as a Man's Thumb.</P>
<P>I tried &s;everal of the Earths of that I&s;land, and extracted out of &s;ome $/32, others from 1/20 to 1/32, and, indeed, mo&s;t of the Rocks abound with Nitre, which I experimented by taking tho&s;e which crum|bled, or &s;eparated into &s;mall Particles like Du&s;t, from which the moi&s;t Air di&s;&s;olved the Salt, which, perhaps, is the Gluten that binds them together when compacted as Stones; but we will leave this for the natural Philo&s;ophers to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, I believe, doth abound with Cop|per, and, perhaps, with finer Metals; for which I will give you my Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Acid Fountains, perhaps, not wanting much of the Acidne&s;s of undephlegmated Oil of Vitriol, which I tried, for want of a better Manner, thus.</P>
<P>I put a clean Knife into the&s;e Fountains, and in about Half a Minute, it would be all over covered with Copper, looking near a Gold Co|lour, &s;o thick, that I could not perceive any Iron
<PB N="429" REF="440">
as far as the Knife was immerged, and held in the Water; and this was not a bare Colouring of the Iron, but coppered over &s;o by letting it &s;tand &s;omething longer, that when I had expo&s;ed the Knife to the Sun 'till it was dry, I could, with another, &s;crape off the Copper, which would be like Scales, and &s;ome in Powder, and where any Scratch, or the like, was in the Knife, it would lie as if it had been enammell'd, &amp;c. There are &s;ome of tho&s;e Waters will much &s;ooner copper a Knife over, than others; and where they run at a Di|&s;tance, the Acidity dimini&s;hes proportionable to their Di&s;tance from the Fountain Head.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal very heavy Sands and Earth of divers Colours, and &s;ome of them exceeding Iron, and not much, if any thing, yielding to Lead, in Pondero&s;ity; &s;ome are of a bluei&s;h Black, others of a purpli&s;h; &s;ome of a bright redi&s;h, others of a dark redi&s;h Colour.</P>
<P>I remember, one Time I was a fi&s;hing on the South-Side of the I&s;land, and being extreme hot, I laid by my Fi&s;hing-Craft, and &s;crambled up the Rocks to find a &s;hady Place to &s;moak a Pipe of Tobacco; I found a Place to my Mind, and fill|ing a Pipe, I took a Piece of dry Silk Cotton Tree, and cutting it into Two Pieces, by Friction I &s;oon kindled it, and lighted my Pipe with it: As I was &s;eriou&s;ly &s;moaking it, contemplating, and looking about me, at a pretty Di&s;tance I perceived a Rock, on which the Sun reflecting his Beams, it gli&s;tered like burni&s;hed Gold: My Curio&s;ity led me thither to inform my&s;elf better of the Occa&s;ion of it, and whether it was only the Sun Beams; and when I had clambered up to it, it looked exactly as if it was all thick gilt: I rubbed my Hand again&s;t it, but nothing came off; whereupon I took my Knife, and found I could &s;crape it off, but it was &s;o thin, that I could collect &s;carce any
<PB N="430" REF="441">
of it; and where I &s;craped it off, the Rock ap|peared, which was of a blacki&s;h Colour: I ob|&s;erved, that the Rock was gilt only where the Water run down, in the Time of the Rains, from the Mountains.</P>
<P>I looked about, and e&s;pied another, which gli|&s;tered with golden Spangles: I went to that al&s;o, and found it all full of Gold Fibres, &s;ome as fine as Hairs, &s;ome as thick as an ordinary Needle, whereupon I took my Knife, and endeavoured to pick out &s;ome of this Gold, and got, I believe, near a Dram Weight, which was &s;olid Gold, as far at I could perceive by the Eye; I had got one little Bit, like a &s;mall flatted Wire, about Half an Inch long, by cutting and rai&s;ing the End up, and not being able to get any more out of the Rock, the Vein running deeper in, I was forced to break it off, by bending it backwards and for|wards Three or Four Times, 'till it broke; and breaking my Knife with the Experiment, I de&s;i&s;t|ed, and came down again to my black Mates, without taking Notice to them of what I had &s;een; and a little before I went from the I&s;land, I told the Governor of it, who would fain have had me gone down with him to &s;hew it him, which Journey I found means to avoid; neither was it ever ob&s;erved by any of the Natives before, and as they were not told the Place, &s;o it's a Que&s;tion whether they have found it yet.</P>
<P>This I&s;land abounds with Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially about the little I&s;lands; where al&s;o, &s;ome Tortoi&s;e re|&s;ort at the Sea&s;on of laying their Eggs; but they are not much regarded for Food, either here, or at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, or at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and yet at all the other I&s;lands, they are accounted their mo&s;t de|licious Food; and, indeed, &s;o they are.</P>

<P>There is good Watering here, by digging a Well almo&s;t any where in the low Land, unle&s;s the rainy Sea&s;on hath fail'd; but at all Times you may water there, in a Valley about half a Mile from the Sea, from which the Natives will bring it down on A&s;&s;es for a Trifle.</P>

<HEAD>The I&s;land of St. <HI>ANTONIO</HI></HEAD>
<P>LIES in Latitude 17&deg;-19# North, and in 8&deg;-2# We&s;t Longitude from the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and is both the We&s;termo&s;t and Northermo&s;t of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands. It's a very high I&s;land, being little, if any thing, inferior to St. <HI>Philip's</HI> in that re&s;pect; and, con&s;idering the high Moun|tains, and low Valleys, it contains as much Ground
<PB N="449" REF="461">
or rather Rocks, as St. <HI>Jago;</HI> and hath abun|dance of running Brooks of fre&s;h Water, which make the Vallies, through which they run, as fertile as any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, for Maiz, Fe&s;hoon, Banana's, Plantanes, Potatoes, Man-d'yokes, Pompions, Water and Musk-Me|lon, Oranges, Lemons, Limes, Guava's, &amp;c. and the greate&s;t Plenty of Wine, tho' the ordi|narie&s;t, and, to make amends for that too, the cheape&s;t of all the I&s;lands.</P>
<P>They have A&s;&s;es and Hogs, which are very large, as well as Plenty of them, a large Stock of Cows, and the Mountains are well repleni&s;h'd with wild Goats, both which belong to the Mar|quis <HI>das Minhas,</HI> lately made Marquis <HI>de Gho-ve.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land is al&s;o in the Vallies very woody; and here the <HI>Beur d'ore</HI> is gather'd, and a Quan|tity &s;ent over, as often as a Ship comes there for the Skins and Hides from <HI>Portugal,</HI> and is put on Board upon the Marquis's Account; but what U&s;e it's apply'd to in <HI>Portugal,</HI> I could not cer|tainly learn.</P>
<P>Here is found on one of the Mountains a tran&s;|parent Stone, call'd, by the Natives, <HI>Topaz;</HI> but whether it be the true <HI>Topaz,</HI> or no, I can't tell, as being no Lapidary.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o <HI>Sanguis Draconis,</HI> or the Gum <HI>Dragons Blood,</HI> produc'd in great Quantities, the which, as well as the Stones, &amp;c. above menti|on'd, as al&s;o all the Ambergri&s;e found about the I&s;land, belongs to the Lord of the Soil; for whom it is gather'd, and a great Penalty laid up|on tho&s;e who conceal, and don't immediately de|liver it to the Governor: Yet it's no hard Matter for any one, that knows how to manage Matters, provided he is Ma&s;ter of the Language, to pro|cure any thing the I&s;land produces at an ea&s;y Rate.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="462">
The Natives here are almo&s;t as innocent and good-temper'd, for the Generality, as the Natives of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>There is, as the Report goes, a Silver Mine on this I&s;land; but the Marquis won't open it, for fear the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;hould &s;eize upon it: And, 'tis &s;aid, that a certain Man extracted &s;o much Gold there on a certain Mountain, where he had liv'd &s;ome time as a Hermit, that one A&s;s was not &s;ufficient to carry it down to the Port where the Ship lay.</P>
<P>There is Abundance of Indigo grows here, and &s;everal great Plantations are inclos'd, wall'd in, and cultivated, on the Account, and for the U&s;e of the Marquis; and there is a <HI>European Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> who is the Manager, who &s;eparates the Tincture, which is &s;ent Home, when the Ship comes from <HI>Portugal</HI> by Order of the Marquis, to collect for him the Profits of the I&s;lands be|longing to him. The Indigo Shrub grows &s;ome|thing like Broom, but not &s;o large, having &s;mall pale green Leaves, &s;omething re&s;embling Box Leaves in Form, which are very juicy. The&s;e Leaves they &s;trip off in <HI>October</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> of which they make their Indigo, by pounding the Leaves to a Pap, and making it then into Cakes or Balls, and, as it dries, it changes from Green to a dark Blue.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Cotton Plantations cultivated, and Cloths made for the Marquis; for, as I told you before, this I&s;land is the Hereditary E&s;tate of that Nobleman. The Cotton Shrub grows about the Bigne&s;s of a Ro&s;e-Bu&s;h, but &s;preads more: The Leaves are of a Gra&s;s-Green, &s;ome|thing like the Leaves of Spinage, but broader, and &s;mooth: The Flowers are of a pale Yellow; which, after they blow away, are &s;ucceeded by round Tods, wherein the Cotton is inclos'd, com|monly
<PB N="451" REF="463">
in three Cells, wherein the Seeds al&s;o are contain'd, which are Black, being of an oval Form, about the Bigne&s;s of <HI>French</HI> Beans.</P>
<P>They make this I&s;land a Store-hou&s;e, as it were, for Slaves; and, I &s;uppo&s;e, when the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Slaving Trade, the then Marquis caus'd a Cargo of Negroes to be brought from <HI>Guinea,</HI> and placed there; who were &s;upply'd, at his Charge, till they had put them&s;elves into a Condition to maintain them&s;elves by Planting, &amp;c. which they &s;oon learned from the free Blacks inhabiting there before; and the&s;e have increas'd very fa&s;t, notwith&s;tanding there have been many of them tran&s;ported, both to <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> whenever the Marqui&s;&s;es have thought fit to or|der it: The&s;e Slaves have Plantations, Hou&s;es, Wives, &amp;c. as the free Blacks have; and &s;ome of the be&s;t Places are cultivated by them for Cot|ton, Indigo, &amp;c. which are all wrought by tho&s;e Slaves, and manag'd by a Steward placed there by the Marquis, who is generally a <HI>European Portugue&s;e,</HI> and has the Title of <HI>Capiteen More.</HI></P>
<P>There is computed to be Two thou&s;and Five hundred Souls on this I&s;land, four Fifths of which Number is made up by the Slaves: They are divided into two Parties, and very often Diffe|rences happen between them, &s;ometimes to the &s;hedding of Blood; the free Blacks valuing them|&s;elves for their Freedom, and the Slaves telling them, they are only Tenants at Will, and that they are wor&s;e than they, as being liable to be turn'd off the I&s;land whenever the Marquis plea&s;es, without knowing where to go, and will therefore be nece&s;&s;itated to yield them&s;elves Slaves whenever the Marquis plea&s;es, &amp;c. And whenever it comes to Blows, the Slaves being the &s;tronger, the free Blacks generally come off with the wor&s;t; and it would be &s;till wor&s;e for them,
<PB N="452" REF="464">
if the Governor, as the Steward is commonly call'd, did not interpo&s;e; and &s;ometimes the ut|mo&s;t of his Authority can hardly re&s;train them. This occa&s;ions the free Blacks to complain very much of the In&s;olence of the Slaves, who, as they imagine, are more favour'd than them&s;elves, which I believe is true.</P>
<P>There are but two Ports or Roads where Ships anchor; the be&s;t is on the South-We&s;t End of the I&s;land call'd <HI>Terra-fall,</HI> and is a &s;andy Bay, and affords good Riding; but is &s;uch a va&s;t long, as well as difficult Way from the Town, and un|inhabited Parts of the I&s;land, that a Ship might lie there a long Time undi&s;cover'd by the Inha|bitants; and by the Report of the Natives, it is four or five good Days Journey from <HI>Terra-fall</HI> to the Town. The other Road is a &s;andy Coa&s;t, rather than Bay, call'd <HI>Praya Simune,</HI> and affords no Shelter from the Wind, which generally blows &s;trong through the Channel between St. <HI>Antonia</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> &s;o that a Ship is often forc'd from her Anchor before &s;he can fini&s;h her Trading: But St. <HI>Vincent</HI> &s;tands their Friend, by &s;tretch|ing over to <HI>Porto Grandc,</HI> where they can ride &s;afe.</P>
<P>When it's fine Weather, and light Winds, a Man may ride well enough at <HI>Praya Simune;</HI> and tis indifferent &s;mooth landing. You may know this Bay by a little Village, to the Northward of which &s;tands a little Chapel, which is the only Chapel and Village obvious to the Sight on that Side of the I&s;land; and running a League, or farther, down along Shore, you will &s;ee the &s;aid &s;andy Road, where you may anchor on the North-Ea&s;t Side, in &s;even, eight, ten, or twelve Fathom; according as your Ve&s;&s;el is, or as you &s;ee the Wea|ther likely to be.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="465">
There is, about half a League to the North|ward of the Chapel, a little Bay or Cove, call'd <HI>Rivera des Trapha,</HI> where a Boat may lie; and has a very good Key to land or take in any thing at, the Water being &s;mooth, and it affording a good Shelter from the Wind by the North-Ea&s;t Point: There is al&s;o a Run of fre&s;h Water, and Wood enough, in the Valley.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee a Pro&s;pect of that, and the re&s;t of the Roads, as well as the Shape of the &s;everal I&s;lands, in the Draughts here annex'd; which although they are not altogether &s;o exact and cu|rious as I could have wi&s;h'd them, by Rea&s;on of the want of Conveniencies, and nece&s;&s;ary Uten|&s;ils, yet, &s;o far I can affirm, as to the mo&s;t mate|rial Parts, they may be intirely depended upon. And I can farther a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that I have deliver'd no Fal&s;ity, either in the Hi&s;tory of my|&s;elf, or in my De&s;cription of tho&s;e People or I&s;lands. What I relate of my own Ob&s;ervation, is certain Matter of Fact, and what I had from others, I endeavour'd to procure it in the exacte&s;t and fulle&s;t Manner that I could. I could &s;ay a great deal more of the Cotton Manufacture; and am certain, that it's po&s;&s;ible to procure Quantities of <HI>Barrafools,</HI> or <HI>Guinea</HI>-trading Cloths for a Trifle, as well as all Sorts of Provi&s;ions for Slav|ing; which, as it would be more agreeable, as being a more natural Food for tho&s;e <HI>Africans,</HI> &s;o I am certain it would come much cheaper than as it is u&s;ually purcha&s;ed; but how far, or whether it would be any ways hurtful to the Trade of tho&s;e Kind of Provi&s;ions bought here for the Slaves, I mu&s;t leave tho&s;e who are concern'd in it to deter|mine, as being the be&s;t Judges.</P>
<P>I could al&s;o much inlarge on the Nitre produc'd in &s;ome of the&s;e I&s;lands; but I have &s;aid&punc; &s;uffi|cient to let the World know, what for the mo&s;t

Part, was unknown to <HI>Europe</HI> before; I &s;ay, for the mo&s;t Part, becau&s;e &s;ome Years pa&s;t, it was known in <HI>Portugal,</HI> that there was Nitre in the I&s;land of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> and they gathered a con&s;i|derable Quantity of the Salt of it, which was &s;ent to <HI>Portugal:</HI> But the Gathering of it, was pro&s;ecuted no farther &s;ince, the Report going, That it was not good Nitre, the greate&s;t Part of it being of the Nature of the Marine Salt: Which might very well be; for where they got this Salt, I tried it, and there was &s;uch a &s;mall Quantity of inflammable Nitre mixed with it, that it would but very faintly kindle, and not one eighth Part burn, or fly away, the re&s;t being a fixed Salt, and in Ta&s;te, nothing differing from the common Marine, or Sea Salt; whereas, in other Places on the &s;ame I&s;land, there would not remain above one half, &s;ome one third, &s;ome one quarter, and &s;ome le&s;s, of fixed inflammable Salt: But at St. <HI>John</HI>'s I&s;land, it was mo&s;tly &s;o volatile, that it would all fly away, except near the Sea; the Rea&s;ons of which, I mu&s;t leave to the philo&s;ophical Searchers of Nature to di&s;cover, and pur&s;ue the Chain of my Relations; the la&s;t Link whereof, is to &s;ay &s;omething of the <HI>Currents,</HI> and <HI>Sea&s;ons,</HI> and then I &s;hall conclude.</P>
<P>The Sea about the&s;e I&s;lands, keeps a regular Influx and Reflux; ebbing Six Hours odd Minutes, and flowing the &s;ame Quantity of Time; flowing higher, and ebbing lower, the &s;ame as in <HI>Europe,</HI> or other Parts, which we commonly call Spring-Tides; and this about, or rather &s;ome Time after the Conjunction and Oppo&s;ition of the Sun and Moon, unle&s;s this Regularity be altered by the Strength of &s;hifting Winds, &amp;c. which is com|mon in other Parts al&s;o, though more ea&s;ily and frequently ob&s;ervable here: But let the Weather be never &s;o calm, yet the Sea runs more high

again&s;t the Rocks, and even in the Bays, about the Full and Change of the Moon, than when the&s;e Two Planets are in or near a &s;quare A&s;pect. I have &s;een at the Square, and in a &s;trong Gale of Wind, which cau&s;ed a great Sea to run in the Channel between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>John</HI>'s, yet in the <HI>Fuurno</HI> the Sea has been very &s;mooth, &s;o that you might have laid a Boat to the Beach without hurting her; and I have ob&s;erved, near the Full and Change, when, perhaps, it had been calm Three or Four Days before, and the Sea as &s;mooth in the Channel afore&s;aid, as in the <HI>Thames</HI> almo&s;t; yet the Sea hove up again&s;t the Shore, that even in the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> you could not put a Boat a&s;hore to the Beach, or Strand, with|out running a Hazard of filling her with the Sea rowling and breaking on the Beach; though then you might land &s;afe enough at the Kaay, yet there the Waves ri&s;e and fall, as if there was a great Sea run without.</P>
<P>The Flood &s;ets to the North-Ea&s;tward, and the Ebb to the South-We&s;tward, and will &s;et more Northerly, Ea&s;terly, We&s;terly, or Southerly, about the&s;e I&s;lands, as the Points or Sides of the I&s;lands, check or turn the Stream, which I have &s;hewn by the Darts about the I&s;land of St. <HI>John,</HI> which I ob&s;erved there, and, as far as I could find, was the &s;ame at the other I&s;lands.</P>
<P>There runs a pretty &s;trong Tide up and down the Channel between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and likewi&s;e between the little I&s;lands and St. <HI>John</HI>'s: There al&s;o runs a good Tide, both Ebb and Flood, between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>Jago</HI>'s; but not &s;o &s;trong as between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>But the &s;tronge&s;t Tides are in the Channels between tho&s;e I&s;lands lying between St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> e&s;pecially the narrow Channel

between St. <HI>Lucia</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> which, on Spring Tides, run very &s;trong: I never had proper Con|veniencies to try or know the Swiftne&s;s of the&s;e Tides, in a determinate Part of Time, &s;ince I found, that the Tides generally keep a regular Cour&s;e, which hath been ob&s;erved but by very few, even of tho&s;e that u&s;e tho&s;e Parts; but, ac|cording to my Judgment, the Tide &s;eems to run as &s;wift in the la&s;t mentioned Channels, as it does in any Part of the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>There are, be&s;ides the&s;e afore-mentioned Cau&s;es of altering the general and ordinary Cour&s;e of the Tides, another not yet mentioned; namely, The <HI>Currents</HI> which commonly &s;et at particular Sea&s;ons, and although their exact Quantity or Quality, is not certainly found; yet the Quality is known thus far, That a little before the Rains, which fall in <HI>June, July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and part of <HI>September,</HI> the Current generally, though not con&s;tantly, &s;ets to the North-Ea&s;tward, and then, at a determi|nate Di&s;tance from the I&s;lands, the Floods gene|rally &s;et &s;tronger through tho&s;e Channels, or about the I&s;lands, than the Ebbs; and contrary|wi&s;e, when the Currents &s;et to the South-We&s;t|ward, which is generally, though not con&s;tantly, in the latter Part of the Rains, and &s;ome Time after, <HI>viz. November, December,</HI> and <HI>January;</HI> then the Lee, or South-We&s;t Currents, are gene|rally &s;wifter than the Windward, or North-Ea&s;t Currents.</P>
<P>The&s;e Currents, however, depend on the Sea|&s;ons, becau&s;e they generally come before, in, and after, though not exactly in, or at the &s;ame Time, yet always about that Time.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid of the <HI>Sea&s;ons;</HI> for it does not rain, nor does the Wind &s;hift exactly at the &s;ame Time every Year; but about the &s;ame Time, &s;ometimes &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later, the

Natives who have the yearly Experience of it, expect the Rains about the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> with faint Southerly Winds, which &s;ometimes they have not till the Beginning, Middle, or latter End of <HI>July,</HI> or it may be, not 'till the Middle of <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> In <HI>September</HI> they have gene|rally, though not con&s;tantly, Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t, and South-South-Ea&s;t, &s;trong Winds, with the Rain: In <HI>October,</HI> South-South-We&s;t, South-We&s;t, and, towards the latter End, We&s;t-North-We&s;t, and North-We&s;t Winds; with Thunder, Lightening, and heavy Rain, and &s;ometimes &s;trong Winds, but they &s;eldom hold long. Between the&s;e Rains, and a little before, you &s;hall have Calms, &s;erene Air, variable light Breezes, and Airs of Wind; and at that Sea&s;on, a &s;mall Southerly Gale will rai&s;e a greater Sea, than a &s;trong Northerly one; but you are to note, Tho&s;e light Airs blowing between the rainy Fits, &s;eldom rai&s;e the Sea: In the Month of <HI>No|vember,</HI> if it rains, it is generally with a fre&s;h, and &s;ometimes &s;trong, Northerly Wind, and generally, when the Rain is thick and heavy the Wind is laid &s;oon; and after that, the Rain beats the Sea down &s;mooth.</P>
<P>After the rainy Sea&s;on is over, it's commonly very hazy, e&s;pecially by Day, and oftentimes from the Beginning of <HI>November</HI> (if it cea&s;e to rain &s;o &s;oon) 'till the latter End of <HI>January,</HI> and all that Time, it generally blows pretty &s;trong, and far Northerly, mo&s;tly North-North-Ea&s;t, and North-Ea&s;t-by-North; but <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> mo&s;tly North-Ea&s;t-by-North, from thence to the Rains more Ea&s;terly; and as it veers to the Ea&s;tward, the Wind decrea&s;es, and blows weaker.</P>
