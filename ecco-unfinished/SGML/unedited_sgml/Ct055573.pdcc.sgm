<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Poem was written la&s;t &s;ummer, immediately after the publication of Sir William Chambers's Di&s;&s;ertation; but the book&s;eller, to whom it was offered, diclined publi&s;hing it, till the town was full. His rea&s;on for this is obvious; yet it would hardly have weigh'd with the author, had he not thought, that his hero's fame would increa&s;e in proportion to his publi&s;her's profit. However he fore&s;aw, that, by this delay, one inconvenience might ari&s;e, which this preface is written to remove. Readers of the pre&s;ent generation are &s;o very inattentive to what they read, that it is probable, one half of Sir William's may have forgotten the principles which his book inculcates. Let the&s;e, then, be reminded, that it is the author's pro|fe&s;t aim in extolling the ta&s;te of the Chine&s;e, to condemn
<PB N="4" REF="3">
that mean and paltry manner which Kent introduced, which Southcote, Hamilton, and Brown followed, and which, to our national di&s;grace, is called the Engli&s;h &s;tyle of garden|ing. He &s;hews the poverty of this ta&s;te, by aptly com|paring it to a dinner, which con&s;i&s;ted of three gro&s;s pieces, three times repeated; and proves to a demon&s;tration, that Nature her&s;elf is incapable of plea&s;ing, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Art, and that too of the mo&s;t luxuriant kind. In &s;hort, &s;uch art as is di&s;played in the Emperor's garden of Yven-Ming-Yven, near Pekin; where fine lizards, and fine wo|men, human giants, and giant baboons, make but a &s;mall part of the &s;uperb &s;cenery. He teaches us, that a perfect garden mu&s;t contain within it&s;elf all the amu&s;ements of a great city; that <HI>Urbs in rure</HI>, not <HI>Rus in urbe</HI>, is the thing, which an improver of true ta&s;te ought to aim at. He &s;ays &mdash;but it is impo&s;&s;ible to abridge all that he &s;ays:&mdash;Let this therefore &s;uffice, to tempt the reader again to peru&s;e his invaluable Di&s;&s;ertation, &s;ince without it, he will never re|li&s;h half the beauties of the following epi&s;tle; for (if her Maje&s;ty's Zebra, and the powder-mills at Houn&s;low be ex|cepted)
<PB N="5" REF="4">
there is &s;carce a &s;ingle image in it, which is not taken from that work.</P>
<P>But though the images be borrowed, the author claims &s;ome &s;mall merit from his application of them. Sir Wil|liam &s;ays too mode&s;tly, "that European arti&s;ts mu&s;t not hope to rival Oriental &s;plendor." The poet &s;hews, that European arti&s;ts may ea&s;ily rival it; and, that Richmond gardens, with only the addition of a new bridge to join them to Brentford, may be new modelled, perfectly <HI>&agrave; la Chinois</HI>. He exhorts his Knight to undertake the glorious ta&s;k, and leaves no cau&s;e to doubt, but that, under the au&s;picious patronage he now &s;o ju&s;tly enjoys, added to the <HI>ready</HI> vote of tho&s;e, who furni&s;h ways and means, the royal work will &s;peedily be compleated.</P>

[With &s;cenes of Yven-Ming.] One of the Imperial gardens at Pekin. [Sayings of Li-T&s;ong.] "Many trees, &s;hrubs, and flowers," &s;ayeth Li-T&s;ong, a Chi|ne&s;e author of great antiquity, "thrive be&s;t in low, moi&s;t &s;ituations; many on hills and mountains; &s;ome require a rich &s;oil; but others will grow on clay, in &s;and, or even upon rocks, and in the water: to &s;ome a &s;unny expo&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary; but for others the &s;hade is preferable. There are plants which thrive be&s;t in expo&s;ed &s;ituations, but in general, &s;helter is requi&s;ite. The &s;kilful gardener, to whom &s;tudy and experience have taught the&s;e qualities, carefully attends to them in his operations; knowing that thereon depend the health and growth of his plants; and con&s;equently the beauty of his plantations." Vide Di&s;&s;. p. 77. The reader, I pre&s;ume, will readily allow, that he never met with much recondite truth, as this ancient Chine&s;e here exhibits.</NOTE>

[Truth at Court.] Vide (if it be extant) a poem under this title, for which (or for the publication of Lord Bolingbroke's philo&s;ophical writings) the per&s;on here mentioned, received a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion in the time of Lord B&mdash;te's admini&s;tration.</NOTE>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8">And, like old Orpheus, make &s;ome &s;trong effort</L>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ver&s;e 45.</BIBL>
[For what is Nature?] This is the great and fundamental axiom, on which oriental ta&s;te is founded. It is therefore expre&s;&s;ed here with the greate&s;t preci|&s;ion, and in the identical phra&s;e of the great original. The figurative terms, and even the explanatory &s;imile are entirely borrowed from Sir William's Di&s;&s;ertation. "<HI>Nature</HI> (&s;ays the Chine&s;e, or Sir William for them) affords us but few materials to work with. <HI>Plants, ground</HI>, and <HI>water</HI>, are her only productions; and, though both the forms and arrange|ments of the&s;e may be varied to an incredible degree, yet have they but few &s;triking va|rieties, the re&s;t being of the nature of <HI>changes rung upon bells</HI>, which, though in reality dif|ferent, &s;till produce the &s;ame uniform kind of <HI>gingling</HI>; the variation being too minute to be ea&s;ily perceived." "<HI>Art</HI> mu&s;t therefore &s;upply <HI>the &s;cantine&s;s of Nature</HI>," &amp;c. &amp;c. page 14. And again, "Our larger works are only a repetition of the &s;mall ones, <HI>like the hone&s;t Bache|lor's fea&s;t</HI>, which con&s;i&s;ted in nothing but a multiplication of his own dinner; <HI>three legs of mutton and turneps, three roa&s;ted gee&s;e, and three buttered apple-pies</HI>."

Page 42. "Sometimes in this romantic excur&s;ion, the pa&s;&s;enger finds him&s;elf in exten&s;ive rece&s;&s;es, &s;urrounded with arbours of je&s;&s;amine, vine, and ro&s;es; where beau|teous <HI>Tartarean dam&s;els</HI>, in loo&s;e tran&s;parent robes that flutter in the air, pre&s;ent him with rich wines, &amp;c. and invite him to ta&s;te the &s;weets of retirement, on Per&s;ian carpets, and beds of Camu&s;athkin down."

Here too they conceal in cavities, on the &s;ummits of the highe&s;t moun|tains, foundaries, lime-kilns, and gla&s;s works, which &s;end forth large volumes of flame, and continued columns of thick &s;moke, that give to the&s;e mountains the appearance of Volcanos." Page 37. "Here the pa&s;&s;enger from time to time, is &s;urprized with repeated &s;hocks of electrical impul&s;e; the earth trembles under him by the power of con|fined air," &amp;c. Page 39. Now to produce both the&s;e effects, viz. the appearance of vol|canos and earthquakes, we have here &s;ub&s;tituted the occa&s;ional explo&s;ion of a <HI>powder-mill</HI>, which (if there be not too much &s;implicity in the contrivance) it is apprehended will at once an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of <HI>lime-kilns</HI>, and <HI>electrical machines</HI>, and imitate <HI>thunder</HI>, and the <HI>explo&s;ion of cannon</HI> into the bargain.
