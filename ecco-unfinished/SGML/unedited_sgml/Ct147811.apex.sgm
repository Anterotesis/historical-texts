<P>_WITH all duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion comes into the world the la&s;t part of this Hi&s;tory under Your Maje&s;ty's pro|tection; a ju&s;t Tribute to Your Ma|je&s;ty, as well on the account of the Memory of the Author, &s;o long en|gaged, and &s;o u&s;efully, in the Ser|vice
<PB REF="60">
of the Crown, as of the work it &s;elf, &s;o worthily memorable for the great Subject He treats of; and &s;o in&s;tructive, by his noble way of treating it.</P>
<P>This work, now it is compleately publi&s;hed, relates the Tran&s;|actions of near twenty years; hardly to be parallel'd in any other time, or place, for the wonderful turns, and pa&s;&s;ages in it. In this &s;pace of time, Your Maje&s;ty &s;ees Your own Country at the highe&s;t pitch of happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, and the lowe&s;t degree of adver&s;ity and mi&s;ery. So that, when a man carries his Thoughts and his Me|mory over all the Occurrences of tho&s;e Times, he &s;eems to be under the power of &s;ome Enchantment, and to dream, rather than read, the Relations of &s;o many &s;urpri&s;ing Revolutions. The peace and the plenty of this Kingdom, and, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time, the bloody de&s;olation of it by a mo&s;t wicked Rebellion, the ruin of &s;o many noble and great Families, and the deva&s;tation of their E&s;tates; and, af|ter this, the Re&s;titution of all things <HI>as at the beginning,</HI> is hardly credible at this time, even &s;o &s;oon after all the&s;e things came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>When Your Maje&s;ty &s;ees one of Your Royal Ance&s;tors, the fir&s;t who liv'd to reign as Heir to the two Crowns of Great <HI>Britain</HI> united, and, on that account, higher in reputation, honour, and power, than any of his Predece&s;&s;ors, brought, by unaccountable Admini&s;trations on the one hand, and by vile Contrivances on the other, into the greate&s;t difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es throughout all his Kingdoms; then left and abandon'd by mo&s;t of his Servants, whom he had him&s;elf rai&s;ed to the greate&s;t honours, and preferments; thus reduced to have &s;carce one faithful able Coun&s;ellor about him, to whom he could <HI>breath his Con&s;cience and Complaints,</HI> and from whom he might expect one hone&s;t, &s;ound, di&s;intere&s;&s;ed Advice: after this, how he was obliged to take up Armes, and to contend with his own Subjects in the Field for his Crown, the Laws, his Liberty, and Life; there meeting with unequal for|tune,
<PB REF="70">
how he was driven from one part of the Kingdom, and from one Body of an Army to another, till at la&s;t he was brought under the power of cruel and mercile&s;s Men, impri&s;on'd, arraign'd, con|demn'd, and executed like a common Malefactor: And after this &s;till, when Your Maje&s;ty &s;ees his Enemies triumphing for a time in their own guilt, and ruling over their fellows, and fir&s;t compa|nions in wickedne&s;s, with &s;ucce&s;sful In&s;olence, till the&s;e very Men by force, and fraud, and &s;undry artifices, &s;till getting the better of one another, brought all Government into &s;uch Confu&s;ion and Anarchy, that no one of them could &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and how then, by God's Providence, the Heir of the Royal Martyr was invited and brought home by the Generality of the People, and their Repre&s;en|tatives, to return, and take on him the Government, in as full an Exerci&s;e of it as any of his Predece&s;&s;ors had ever enjoyed; not &s;ubject to any of tho&s;e Treaties, or Conditions, which had been &s;o often offer'd by his Father to the Men then in credit, and power, and, in their pride and fury, had been as often rejected by them: When Your Majesty &s;ees before You all this begun, and carried on in Violence and War, and concluded in a peaceful Re&s;toration, within the &s;pace of twenty years, by <HI>Engli&s;h-</HI>men alone amongst them&s;elves, without the Intervention of any foreign power; many of the &s;ame hands joyning in the recovery and &s;ettlement, as they had done before in the De&s;truction of their Country; Your Maje&s;ty will certainly &s;ay,</P>
<P>This was the Lord's doing, and it mu&s;t ever be mar|vellous in our eyes.</P>
<P>An Account of this great work of God coming to be publi&s;h'd in Your Maje&s;ty's time, it is humbly conceiv'd not improper to con|gratulate Your good fortune, that, in the beginning of Your Reign, &s;uch a History of the greatest Matters, pa&s;s'd within Your own Dominions, comes to light; as well for the nece&s;&s;ity there may be,
<PB REF="80">
after above forty years run out in a very un&s;ettled and various management of the publick Affairs, to put men in mind again of tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs under which &s;o many great Men fell on both &s;ides, as in hopes, that on Your Maje&s;ty's account, and for the Glory of Your Name, whom Your People have univer&s;ally receiv'd with joy, this Generation may be inclined to let the&s;e fre&s;h examples of Good and Evil &s;ink into their minds, and make the deeper impre&s;|&s;ion in them to follow the one, and avoid the other.</P>
<P>From the year <HI>1660</HI> to very near <HI>1685,</HI> which was the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign here in <HI>England,</HI> it mu&s;t needs be own'd, that, with all the very good Under&s;tanding, and excellent good Nature of that King, there was a great mixture of Coun&s;els, and great vici&s;&s;itudes of good and bad Events, all|mo&s;t throughout that &s;pace of time attending his Government. They &s;eem indeed to be &s;omewhat like the four Sea&s;ons of the year; of which three Quarters are generally fair, hopeful, flouri&s;hing, and gay; but there come as con&s;tantly &s;evere Winters, that freez, wither, de&s;troy, and cut off many hopeful plants, and expectations of things to come.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be own'd too, &s;ince it can never be concealed, that, from the beginning of the Re&s;toration, there was, certainly, not &s;uch a Return to God Allmighty for the wonderful Ble&s;&s;ings he had pour'd out with &s;o liberal a hand, as, no doubt was due to the great Au|thor and Giver of all that Happine&s;s: neither was there &s;uch a prudence in the Admini&s;tration, or &s;uch a &s;teadine&s;s in the conduct of Affairs, as the fre&s;h Experience of the foregone misfortunes might well have forewarn'd tho&s;e that were entru&s;ted in it, to have pur&s;ued with Courage and Con&s;tancy. It is but too notorious there was great forgetfulne&s;s of God, as well as manife&s;t Mi&s;takes to|wards the World; which quickly brought forth fruits meet for &s;uch undutifulne&s;s, and ill conduct.</P>
<P><PB REF="90">
The next four years after that Reign, were attended with more fatal Mi&s;carriages; over which it may be more decent to draw a Veil, than to enter into a particular enumeration of them. Many great Princes have been led unawares into irrecoverable Errors; and the greater they are, &s;o many more particular Per&s;ons are u&s;ually involv'd in the Calamity.</P>
<P>What follow'd after this time, till Your Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t happy coming to the Throne, is &s;o fre&s;h in the memory of all Men yet living, that every one will be be&s;t able to make his own ob&s;ervations upon it. Such Deliverances have their pangs in the Birth, that much weaken the Con&s;titution, in endeavouring to pre&s;erve, and amend it.</P>
<P>And now Your Maje&s;ty, who &s;ucceeds to a Revolution, as well as a Re&s;toration, has the advantage of a retro&s;pect on all the&s;e Ac|cidents, and the benefit of reviewing all the failings in tho&s;e times: and what&s;oever was wanting, at tho&s;e opportunities of amending pa&s;t Errors, in the management of Affairs, for the better e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Crown, and the &s;ecurity of the true old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Go|vernment, it will be Your Maje&s;ty's happine&s;s to &s;upply in Your time: a time in &s;ome &s;ort re&s;embling the au&s;picious beginning of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Re&s;toration; for in that time, as now in Your Majesty's, the People of this Kingdom ran chearfully into obedience; the chiefest Offenders lay quiet under a &s;en&s;e of their own Crimes, and an apprehen&s;ion of the reward justly due to them; and all Your Subjects went out to meet Your Majesty with Duty, and most with Love.</P>
<P>Compari&s;ons of Times may be as odious as that of Per&s;ons; and therefore no more &s;hall be &s;aid here on that Subject, than that &s;ince the Restoration, and &s;ome few years after it, given up to joy, and the forgetfulne&s;s of past Mi&s;eries, there hath been no time that brought &s;o much hope of quiet, and &s;o general a &s;atisfaction to the&s;e Kingdoms, as that on which we &s;aw Your Majesty &s;o happily
<PB REF="100">
&s;eated upon the Throne of Your Ancestors. Among all the &s;igns of greatne&s;s and glory in a Prince's Reign, there is none more really advantageous, none more comfortable, than that which <HI>Virgil</HI> re|marks as a felicity in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI></P>
<P>When abroad the Soveraign is pro&s;perous, and at home does govern Subjects willing to obey:</P>
<P>When it is not fear that drives and compels them, but affection and loving-kindne&s;s that draws them, to their duty; and makes them rejoyce under the Laws by which they are govern'd. Such was certainly the time of Your Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t Entrance; and &s;uch God grant it may be ever.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Volumes of this History have laid before Your Majesty the original cau&s;es, and the foundations of the Rebellion, and Civil War; the contrivances, de&s;igns, and con&s;ultations in it; and the mi&s;erable events of it; and &s;eem'd to have fini&s;h'd the whole War, when the Author, at the very end of the ninth Book, &s;ays, that <HI>from that time there remain'd no po&s;&s;ibility for the King to draw any more Troops together in the Field.</HI> And when there's an end of Action in the Field, the inquiries into the con&s;equences afterwards are u&s;ually le&s;s warm.</P>
<P>But it happens in the Cour&s;e of this Hi&s;tory, that &s;everal new Scenes of new Wars, and the Events of them, are open'd in this Vo|lume; which, it is hoped, will prove exceeding u&s;eful, even in tho&s;e parts, where, by rea&s;on of the &s;adne&s;s of the Subject, it cannot be de|lightful, and, in all other parts of it, both u&s;eful and delightful.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty e&s;pecially, who mu&s;t have Your heart perpetually intent to &s;ee what follow'd in the clo&s;e of all tho&s;e Wars, and by what means and methods the lo&s;s of all that noble and innocent Blood, and particularly that portion of the Royal Stream then &s;pilt, was recompen&s;ed upon Their heads who were the wicked Contrivers of the Parricide, and how at la&s;t the mi&s;eries of the&s;e Nations, and
<PB REF="110">
the &s;ufferings of Your Royal Family were all recover'd by God All|mighty's own unerring hand, will, no doubt, be more agreeably en|tertain'd in this Volume with the Relation of the &s;ecret &s;teps of the return of God's Mercy, than when he &s;till &s;eem'd openly to have for|&s;aken his own oppre&s;&s;ed Cau&s;e; wherein &s;o much of what was deare&s;t to Your &s;elf was &s;o highly concern'd.</P>
<P>Of the Tran&s;actions within the&s;e Kingdoms, &s;oon after the War was ended, e&s;pecially ju&s;t before, and after the barbarous Murther of the Ble&s;&s;ed King, this Author could have but &s;hort and imperfect informations abroad. It cannot therefore ju&s;tly be expected, that he &s;hould be &s;o full, or minute in many circum&s;tances relating to the actions and con&s;ultations of that Party here at home, as are to be found in &s;ome other Writers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to intend only &s;uch matters.</P>
<P>One thing indeed were very much to be wi&s;h'd, that he had given the world a more di&s;tinct, and particular Narrative of that pious King's la&s;t mo&s;t magnanimous &s;ufferings in his Impri&s;onments, Tryal, and Death. But it &s;eems the remembrance of all tho&s;e deplorable pa&s;&s;ages was &s;o grievous, and in&s;upportable to the Writer's mind, that he abhorr'd the dwelling long upon them, and cho&s;e rather to contract the whole black Tragedy within too narrow a compa&s;s. But this is a lo&s;s that can only now be lamented, not repaired.</P>
<P>But when the Hi&s;tory brings Your Maje&s;ty to what the noble Writer e&s;teem'd one of his principal bu&s;ine&s;&s;es in this Volume, to at|tend King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and his two Royal Brothers, through|out all their wandrings, which take up a con&s;iderable &s;hare of it, and are mo&s;t accurately and knowingly de&s;cribed by him, as having been a con&s;tant Witne&s;s of mo&s;t of them, it is pre&s;umed, This part may give Your Maje&s;ty equal &s;atisfaction to any that is gone before it. It will not be unplea&s;ant to Your Maje&s;ty, &s;ince You have known &s;o well the happy conclu&s;ion of it, to &s;ee the bani&s;h'd King under his
<PB REF="120">
long adver&s;e Fortune, and how many years of trouble and di&s;tre&s;s he patiently waited God Allmighty's appointed time, for his Re|demption from that Captivity.</P>
<P>In that di&s;con&s;olate time of di&s;tre&s;s and lowne&s;s of his Fortune, Your Maje&s;ty will find cau&s;e to ob&s;erve, that there were Factions even Then in his little Court beyond Sea; &s;o in&s;eparable are &s;uch undecent and unchri&s;tian contentions from all Communities of men: They are like <HI>Tares &s;own by an Enemy among&s;t the Wheat, whil&s;t good men &s;leep.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Subject of the Factions in tho&s;e days, there is a parti|cular pa&s;&s;age in this Hi&s;tory, of two Parties in that Court abroad, who thought it worth their while, even Then to be very indu&s;trious in pro&s;ecuting this Author with unju&s;t and fal&s;e accu&s;ations. And the Author him&s;elf ob&s;erves, that, how&s;oever tho&s;e Parties &s;eem'd, on mo&s;t other accounts, incompatible the one with the other, they were very heartily united in endeavouring to compa&s;s His de&s;tru|ction; and for no other rea&s;on, that ever appear'd, but his being an unwearied A&s;&s;ertor of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Cau&s;e, and a con|&s;tant Friend and Servant to the true Interest of it; to which either of Them was really more irreconcileable, than they were to each other, what&s;oever they pretended.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to de&s;erve a particular reflection, becau&s;e, within few years after that King's Restoration, &s;ome of both tho&s;e Parties joyn'd again in attacking this noble Author, and accu&s;ing him anew of the very &s;ame pretended crimes they had objected to him abroad; where there had been &s;o much malice &s;hew'd on one &s;ide, and &s;o much natural and irre&s;i&s;tible innocency appear'd on the other, that one would have thought, no Arrow out of the &s;ame Quiver, could have been enough envenom'd to have hurt &s;o faithful, &s;o con|&s;tant, and &s;o tried a Servant to the Church and Crown.</P>
<P>This particular, and another, wherein Your Maje&s;ty will find
<PB REF="130">
what advice this Author gave his Royal Ma&s;ter, upon the occa&s;ion of his being much pre&s;s'd to go to Church to <HI>Charenton,</HI> and how &s;ome Intrigues, and Snares, cunningly laid on one &s;ide, were very plainly and boldly withstood on the other by this Author, will let the world &s;ee, why this man was by any means to be removed, if his Adver&s;aries could effect it, as one that was perpetually cro&s;&s;ing their mi&s;chievous de&s;igns, by an habitual cour&s;e of adhering unmoveably to the Intere&s;t of this Church and Nation.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of this Book, Your Maje&s;ty will al&s;o find &s;ome very near that King whil&s;t he was abroad, endeavouring to take ad|vantage of the forlorne and de&s;perate circum&s;tances of his fortune, to per&s;wade him, that the Party who had fought for his Father, was an in&s;ignificant, a de&s;picable, and undone Number of Men; and, on this account, putting him on the thoughts of marrying &s;ome Ro|man Catholick Lady, who might engage tho&s;e of that Religion, both at home and abroad, in his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t; Others at the &s;ame time, with equal importunity, recommending the power of the Pre&s;|byterians, as mo&s;t able to do him &s;ervice, and bring him home.</P>
<P>This noble Author all this while per&s;i&s;ted, in the integrity of his Soul, to u&s;e that credit his faithfulne&s;s and truth had gain'd him, to convince the King, that foreign force was a &s;trength not de&s;irable for him to depend on, and, if it were &s;u&s;pected to be on the Intere&s;t of Popery, of all things mo&s;t likely to prevent, and di&s;appoint his Re|storation; that for his own Subjects, none of them were to be ne|glected; his Armes ought to be &s;tretch'd out to receive them all; but the old Royal Party was that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould chiefly rely on, both to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Return, and afterwards to e&s;tabli&s;h his Go|vernment.</P>
<P>This noble Author had been a watchful ob&s;erver of all that had pa&s;&s;ed in the time of the Troubles; and had the opportunity to have &s;een the actions, and penetrated, in a good mea&s;ure, into the
<PB REF="140">
con&s;ultations of tho&s;e days, and was no ill judge of the temper and nature of mankind; and He, it &s;eems, could not be of opinion, but that They who had ventur'd all for the Father, would be the true&s;t and firme&s;t Friends to the Son.</P>
<P>Whether this grew up in him to be his judgement, from his ob|&s;ervation of the Rules of Nature, and a general practice in all wi&s;e Men to depend mo&s;t on the Service, and Affection of tho&s;e who had been &s;teady to them in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es; or whether a luke-warm Trimming indifferency, though &s;ometimes dignified with the Cha|racter of Politicks, did not &s;uit with His plain dealing, it is cer|tain, he never could advi&s;e a Prince to hold a Conduct that &s;hould grieve, and di&s;oblige his old Friends, in hope of getting new ones, and make all his old Enemies rejoyce. But, however his malicious Pro&s;ecutors afterwards &s;candalized him, as being the Author of &s;uch Coun&s;els, and objected to him what was their own advice and practice, He really thought this kind of Conduct weaken'd the hands, and tended to the &s;ubver&s;ion of any Government. And the &s;ucce&s;s has approved this judgement; for in the very inconstant, and va|riable Admini&s;tration under that King, it was found by Experience, and to this day the Memorials of it are extant, that he had quiet and calm days, or more rough and boi&s;terous weather, as he favour'd, or di&s;countenanced his own <HI>Party;</HI> called indeed a <HI>Party</HI> by the Enemies of it, upon a levelling principle of allowing no di&s;tinctions; though all who have contended against it, were properly <HI>but Par|ties;</HI> whilst that was then, and is &s;till, on the advantage-ground of being establi&s;hed by the Laws, and incorporated into the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>By degrees Your Maje&s;ty is brought, in the cour&s;e of this Hi|story, as it were to the top of &s;ome exalted height, from whence You may behold all the errors and misfortunes of the time pa&s;t with ad|vantage to Your &s;elf; may view Armies drawn up, and Battles
<PB REF="150">
fought, without Your part of the danger; and, by the experience of former Misfortunes, establi&s;h Your own Security.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be a Situation not unlike that of the Temple of Wi&s;|dom in <HI>Lucretius;</HI> from whence he advi&s;es his readers to look down on all the Vanity and Hurry of the World. And as that Phi|lo&s;ophical Poet does very movingly de&s;cribe the pur&s;uits of tho&s;e whom he ju&s;tly styles Mi&s;erable Men, distracting them&s;elves in weari&s;om contentions about the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Greatne&s;s of an empty world; &s;o does this noble Hi&s;torian, with true and evident de|ductions from one cau&s;e and event to another, and &s;uch an agree|able thread of entertainment, that one is never content to give over reading, bring Your Maje&s;ty to an ea&s;y a&s;cent over all the know|ledge of tho&s;e mi&s;erable times; from whence not in &s;peculation onely, but really and experimentally, You may look down on all the folly, and madne&s;s, and wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e &s;ecret Contrivances, and open Violences, whereby the Nation, as well as the Crown, was brought to de&s;olation; and &s;ee how fal&s;ly and weakly tho&s;e great and bu&s;y di&s;turbers of peace pretended Reformation, and Religion, and to be &s;eeking God in every one of their rebellious and &s;inful Actions; whereas God was not to be found in their Thunder, nor their Earth|quakes, that &s;eem'd to &s;hake the foundations of the World; but in the &s;till voice of peace he came at la&s;t, to defeat and di&s;appoint all their Inventions: That God, to whom vengeance belongs, aro&s;e, and &s;hew'd him&s;elf in defence of that righteous Cau&s;e of the Crown and Church; which Your Maje&s;ty will ob&s;erve to have been com|bined again&s;t, fought with, overthrown, and in the end rai&s;ed, and ree&s;tabli&s;hed together. <HI>Now the&s;e things happen'd for en|&s;amples, and they are written for our admonition.</HI></P>
<P>It is now mo&s;t humbly &s;ubmitted to Your Maje&s;ty's judgement, whether the con&s;ideration of the&s;e matters, &s;et forth in this Hi|&s;tory, be not the mo&s;t u&s;eful pro&s;pect not for Your &s;elf onely, but
<PB REF="160">
Your noble&s;t Train, Your great Council, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in Parliament a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>When Your Maje&s;ty is &s;o attended, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, no power on Earth will be able to di&s;appoint Your Wi&s;dom, or re&s;i&s;t Your Will. And there may be need of all this power and authority, to pre&s;erve, and defend Your Subjects, as well as Your Crown, from the like di&s;tractions and inva&s;ions. There may want the con|currence of a Parliament, to prevent the return of the &s;ame mi&s;|chievous practices, and to restrain the madne&s;s of Men of the &s;ame Principles in this Age, as de&s;troyed the la&s;t: &s;uch as think them|&s;elves even more capable than tho&s;e in the la&s;t, to carry on the like wicked de&s;igns; &s;uch as take them&s;elves to be inform'd, even from this History, how to mend the mi&s;takes then committed by the prin|cipal Directors on that &s;ide, and by a more refin'd skill in wicked|ne&s;s, to be able once again to overthrow the Monarchy, and then to perpetuate the de&s;truction of it.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, Madam, but every thing that is repre&s;ented to Your Majesty of this Nature, will find a Party ready to deny it; that will joyn hand in hand to a&s;&s;ure the world there is no &s;uch thing. It is a common Cau&s;e, and it is their Intere&s;t, if they can, to per&s;wade Men, that it is onely the heat and warmth of <HI>High-Church Inventions, that &s;ugge&s;ts &s;uch fears, and jea|lou&s;ies.</HI></P>
<P>But let any impartial Per&s;on judge, to whom all the Liber|tines of the Republican Party are like to unite them&s;elves; and whether it is imaginable, that the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government, ei|ther in Church or State, can be &s;trengthen'd, or &s;erv'd by them. They mu&s;t go to the Enemies of both, and pretend there is no &s;uch thing as a Republican Party in <HI>England,</HI> that they may be the le&s;s ob&s;erv'd, and go on the more &s;ecure in their destructive projects.</P>
<P><PB REF="170">
They can have no better game to play, than to declare, that none but <HI>Jacobites</HI> alarm the Nation with the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions; and that <HI>Jacobites</HI> are much greater Enemies than Them&s;elves to Your Majesty. Let that be &s;o: no Man, in his Wits, can &s;ay any thing to Your Majesty in behalf of any, let them be who they will, that will not own Your Government, and wi&s;h the pro|&s;perity and the happine&s;s of it, and contribute all they can to main|tain it.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the&s;e Men mo&s;t fal&s;ely a&s;per&s;e the Sons of the Church of <HI>England</HI> for being <HI>Jacobites,</HI> let them rather clear them|&s;elves of what they were lately charg'd before Your Majesty, that there are Societies of them which celebrate the horrid thir|tieth of <HI>January,</HI> with an execrable Solemnity of &s;candalous mirth; and that they have Seminaries, and a &s;ort of Univer&s;ities, in <HI>England,</HI> maintain'd by great contributions, where the fiercest Doctrines again&s;t Monarchical, and Epi&s;copal Government, are taught and propagated, and where they bear an implacable hatred to Your Maje&s;ty's Title, Name, and Family.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be a Torrent that cannot be re&s;i&s;ted but by the whole Legi&s;lative Authority; neither can Your Throne, which they are thus perpetually a&s;&s;aulting, or undermining, be &s;upported by a le&s;s power.</P>
<P>In the&s;e difficulties Your great Council will, over and above their Per&s;onal duty to Your Majesty, take them&s;elves to be more concern'd to be zealous in the defence of Your Royal Prerogative, as well as of their own ju&s;t Rights and Privileges, in that it was under the Name and Style of a Parliament, though very unju&s;tly &s;ocall'd, that all the mi&s;chiefs mention'd in this Hi&s;tory were brought upon the Kingdom.</P>
<P>They be&s;t can di&s;cover the Craft and Subtilty formerly u&s;ed in tho&s;e Con&s;ultations; which fir&s;t inveigled, and drew men in from
<PB REF="180">
one wickedne&s;s to another, before they were aware of what they were doing; and engaged them to think them&s;elves not &s;afe, but by doing greater Evils than they began with.</P>
<P>They will, no doubt, be filled with a ju&s;t indignation against all that Hypocri&s;y and Villany, by which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Name, and Nation, were expo&s;ed to the cen&s;ure of the re&s;t of the world: They onely can be able to pre&s;ent Your Maje&s;ty with remedies pro|per, and adequate to all the&s;e evils, by which God may be glori|fied, and the ancient Con&s;titution of this Government retriev'd, and &s;upported.</P>
<P>There is one calamity more, that &s;tands in need of a cure from Your own Soveraign hand. It is in truth a peculiar Calamity fallen mo&s;t heavily on this Age, which though it took its chief ri&s;e from the di&s;orderly, di&s;&s;olute times of tho&s;e Wars, and has mon&s;trou&s;ly increa&s;ed ever &s;ince, yet was never own'd &s;o much as Now, and that is a barefaced contempt, and di&s;u&s;e of all Religion what &s;o|ever. And indeed what could &s;o much feign'd Sanctity, and &s;o much real Wickedne&s;s, during that Rebellion begun in <HI>1641,</HI> produce el&s;e in fooli&s;h Mens hearts, than to &s;ay, <HI>There is no God?</HI></P>
<P>This Irreligion was then pretended to be cover'd with a more &s;ignal Morality and preci&s;e &s;trictne&s;s in life and conver&s;ation, which was to be a recompence for the lo&s;s of Chri&s;tianity. But now, even that Shadow of godline&s;s and virtue is fled too. A|thei&s;m, and Profanene&s;s, diligently cultivated, have not failed to produce a pro&s;titution of all Manners in contempt of all Govern|ment.</P>
<P>This profanene&s;s and impiety &s;eems, next to the horrible confu|&s;ions of the late Rebellion, to have gain'd ground chiefly by this method, that, when many who have been in Authority have not, on &s;everal Accounts, been heartily affected to the &s;upport of the
<PB REF="190">
Church e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, there has crept in, by little and little, a liberty against all Religion. For where the chief Advi&s;ers or Managers of publick Affairs, have inclined to alterations, which the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules have not countenanced, they dur&s;t not cau&s;e the Laws to be put in Execution, for fear of turning the force of them on Them&s;elves; &s;o their next refuge has been to &s;uffer men to ob&s;erve no di&s;cipline, or government at all.</P>
<P>Thus the Church of <HI>England,</HI> put to Nur&s;e, as it were, &s;ome|times to &s;uch as have been inclined to Popery, and &s;ometimes to other Sects, and &s;ometimes to men indifferent to all Religion, hath been in danger of being starv'd, or overlaid, by all of them; and the ill con&s;equence has redounded not onely to the Members of that Communion, but to all the Profe&s;&s;ors of Christianity it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Whoever have ventur'd to give warning of the&s;e wicked de|&s;igns and practices, have been render'd as Per&s;ons of ill temper and very bad affections. They that have been in Credit and Au|thority, have been frequently inclined to be favourable to the men complain'd of; it has been offer'd on their behalf, that their inten|tions were good; and that it was even the Interest of the Govern|ment to cover their Principles, whatever might be the con&s;equences of them.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs have been &s;till growing, and no Laws have hitherto reached them; and, po&s;&s;ibly, they are become inca|pable of a remedy; unle&s;s Your Maje&s;ty's great example of Piety and Virtue &s;hall have &s;ufficient influence to amend them: No ho|ne&s;t man can &s;ay it is not rea&s;onable, and even nece&s;&s;ary, to watch them; and that, in compa&s;&s;ion to Your Subjects, as well as ju&s;tice to Your &s;elf. This Hi&s;tory hath &s;hewn Your Maje&s;ty their fruits in the late times, by which You &s;hall know them &s;till; for Your Maje&s;ty well remembers Who has &s;aid, that</P>
<P>Men do not gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thi&s;tles.</P>
<P><PB REF="200">
That God may give Your Maje&s;ty a di&s;cerning Spirit, a wi&s;e, and under&s;tanding Heart, to judge aright of all things that belong to Your peace; that He may enable You to &s;ubdue Your Ene|mies abroad by &s;ucce&s;sful Coun&s;els, and Armes, and to reduce Your Ill-willers at home by prudent Laws, admini&s;ter'd with the meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom; that He would give You length of days in one hand, and Riches and Honour in the other; that You, in Your days, may have the glory to restore good Nature (for which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation was formerly &s;o celebrated) and good manners, as well as the &s;incere profe&s;&s;ion, and univer&s;al practice of the true Religion, in Your Kingdoms; and that His Allmighty power may defend You with his favourable Kindne&s;s as with a Shield, again&s;t all Your Adver&s;aries of every kind, are the zealous, con&s;tant, and devout prayers of &s;o many Millions, that it were the highe&s;t pre|&s;umption in any One Per&s;on, to &s;ub&s;cribe a particular Name to &s;o Univer&s;al a Concern.</P>

<P>IN the mean time no ways were left untryed to draw &s;uch a Body of an Army together, as might enable his Maje&s;ty to make &s;ome attempt upon the Enemy; and if he could, by all po&s;&s;ible endeavours, have <MILESTONE N="20">

drawn out of all his Garri&s;ons left, a force of five thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot (which at that time &s;eem'd a thing not to be de&s;paired of) he did more de&s;ire to have lo&s;t his life, in &s;ome &s;ignal attempt upon any part of the Enemies Army, than to have enjoyed any conditions which he fore&s;aw he was ever like to obtain by Treaty; and he was not out of hope of a Body of five thou&s;and Foot to be landed in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> which his Letters from <HI>France</HI> confidently promi&s;ed, and which had been &s;o much expected, and depended upon by the Prince, that it kept him from tran&s;porting him&s;elf into <HI>Silly,</HI> till <HI>Fairfax</HI> was march'd (as hath been &s;aid before) within little more than twenty Miles of <HI>Pendennis.</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> For S^r <HI>Dudly Wyat</HI> had been &s;ent expre&s;sly from the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure the Prince, that &s;uch a Body of five thou&s;and Foot were actually rai&s;ed under the Command of <HI>Ruvignie,</HI> and &s;hould be embarked for <HI>Pendennis</HI> within le&s;s than a month; and the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> in a Po&s;t|&s;cript to that Letter which he writ to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by S^r <HI>Dudly Wyat,</HI> wi&s;hed him not to be too &s;trict in the computation of the Month from the date of the Letter, becau&s;e there might be ac|cidents of Winds at that Sea&s;on; but he de&s;ired him to be confident, that they &s;hould be all landed within the expiration of &s;ix Weeks, and by that Mea&s;ure to conduct the re&s;olutions, and to decline fighting <MILESTONE N="20"> upon that Account: After all this, it is as true, that there was never a Man at this time levied, or de&s;ign'd for that expedition, only the Name of <HI>Ruvignie</HI> (becau&s;e he was of the Religion, and known to be a good Officer) had been mention'd, in &s;ome loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e by the Car|dinal, as one who would be very fit to Command any Troops which might be &s;ent into <HI>England</HI> for the relief of the King; which the other, according to his natural credulity, thought to be Warrant enough to give both the King and the Prince that unrea&s;onable Expectation; the which and many other of that great Lord's Negotiations and Tran&s;|actions, the &s;ucceeding, and long continuing Misfortunes, kept from <MILESTONE N="30"> being ever after examin'd, or con&s;ider'd and reflected upon.</P>
<P>THE Prince &s;tayed in the I&s;le of <HI>Silly</HI> from <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 4^t^h of <HI>March</HI> till <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 16^t^h of <HI>April,</HI> the Wind having continued &s;o contrary, that the Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Hopton</HI> came not to him from <HI>Corn|wal</HI> till the <HI>Saturday</HI> before; at which time likewi&s;e arriv'd a Trum|peter from S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> with &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age from the Parliament to the Prince as might well be called a Summons, rather than an Invita|tion; yet it was well it came not to <HI>Pendennis,</HI> where it would have found a Party among the Prince's Servants. The next Morning, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> a Fleet of about twenty &s;even, or twenty eight Sail of Ships, <MILESTONE N="40"> incompa&s;&s;ed the I&s;land; but within three or four hours, by a very notable tempe&s;t, which continued two days, they were di&s;per&s;ed. Upon this, and a clear determination of the weakne&s;s of the Place, if it &s;hould be attacked by any con&s;iderable &s;trength (which both by the Me&s;&s;age and the Attendants of it they had rea&s;on to apprehend) together with the extreme &s;carcity of Provi&s;ions in that I&s;land, which had not been, in the &s;ix weeks the Prince &s;taid there, &s;upplied with Victual for two days out of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> neither had there been any returns from <HI>France</HI> upon the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI>'s application to the Queen, which returns would every day grow more difficult by the Sea&s;on of the year, his <MILESTONE N="50"> Highne&s;s inclined to remove to <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> again&s;t which nothing could be objected of Weight, but the con&s;ideration of the King's being at <HI>Lon|don</HI> (which was &s;trongly reported &s;till) in a Treaty; and then, that his

Highne&s;s's remove, e&s;pecially if by di&s;tre&s;s of Weather he &s;hould be forced into <HI>France,</HI> might be prejudicial to the King; and therefore it would be rea&s;onable, fir&s;t to expect &s;ome adverti&s;ement from his Ma|je&s;ty in what condition he was. Hereupon his Highne&s;s produced in Council this en&s;uing Letter from the King, which was writ &s;hortly af|ter the Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> and which he had conceal'd till that Morning from all the Lords, and which truly, I think, was the only &s;ecret he had ever kept from the four he had tru&s;ted.</P>

Be&s;ides, for &s;atisfaction of others, I have moved the Queen Regent to give a&s;&s;urance, that if the Prince, in his way to <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> &s;hould be nece&s;&s;itated, by contrary winds, or the danger of the Parliament Shipping, to touch in <HI>France,</HI> he &s;hould have all freedom, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from hence, in his immediate pa&s;&s;age thither; which is granted with great chearfulne&s;s, and civility, and will be &s;ub&s;cribed under the hands of the <HI>French</HI> King and Queen, my Brother, and Cardinal <HI>Mazarin:</HI> therefore I hope all &s;cruples are now &s;atisfied. <HI>Colepepper</HI> is ha&s;tening to you with good Frigats; but if you <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;hall find any danger before their arrival, I &s;hall rely upon your care not to omit any opportunity to prevent that danger, according to the re&s;olution in Council, which <HI>Colepepper</HI> hath acquainted me with; for which I thank you.

<P>THE Prince and Council were very glad at the receipt of this Letter <MILESTONE N="50"> conceiving that they had now done all that could be required at their hands; though they were adverti&s;ed at their fir&s;t landing there, that there was &s;till an expectation of the Prince in <HI>France;</HI> and that he would

<P>THIS Letter, and the very pa&s;&s;ionate Commands from the Queen, <MILESTONE N="40"> together with what was privately &s;aid to his Highne&s;s by the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who from his being at <HI>Paris</HI> had changed his former opi|nions, and was (though he expre&s;s'd it tenderly; finding a general aver|&s;ion) po&s;itive for his going, wrought &s;o far on the Prince, that he di&s;|cover'd an Inclination to the Journey; whereupon the Council pre|&s;ented at large to him, the Inconveniences and dangers that naturally might be &s;uppo&s;ed would attend &s;uch a re&s;olution: They remember'd, the Carriage of the <HI>French</HI> &s;ince the beginning of this Rebellion; how it had been originally &s;omented, and afterwards countenanced by them; and that they had never, in the lea&s;t degree, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the King; that <MILESTONE N="50"> there was no Evidence that, at that time, they were more inclined to him than to the Rebels; that it would be nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould make &s;ome publick Declaration on his Maje&s;ties behalf, before the Heir ap|parent

of the Crown &s;hould put him&s;elf into their hands. There was nothing omitted that could be thought of, to render that re&s;olution at lea&s;t to be of that importance that it ought to be throughly weigh'd, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lords</HI> Capel <HI>and</HI> Colepepper <HI>&s;ent to</HI> Paris, <HI>to di&s;&s;wade the Queen from &s;ending for the Prince into</HI> France.</NOTE> and con&s;ider'd, before executed; and &s;o, in the end they prevailed with the Prince (&s;ince at that time it was not known where the King was) to &s;end the Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Colepepper</HI> again to the Queen, to pre&s;ent the weightine&s;s of the matter to her Maje&s;ty.

<P><Q>&startq;YOU &s;hall inform her Maje&s;ty, that We have, with all duty and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their In&s;tru|ctions and Ar|rival at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, con&s;ider'd her Letters to Us concerning our &s;peedy re|pair <MILESTONE N="10"> into the Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> the which direction, We conceive to be grounded upon her Maje&s;ties apprehen&s;ion of danger to our Per|&s;on by any re&s;idence here; the contrary whereof, We believe, her Maje&s;ty will be no &s;ooner adverti&s;ed of, than &s;he will hold Us excu&s;ed for not giving that pre&s;ent obedience which We de&s;ire allways to yield to the lea&s;t Intimation of her Maje&s;ty; and therefore, you &s;hall hum|bly acquaint her Maje&s;ty, that We have great rea&s;on to believe this I&s;land, to be defen&s;ible again&s;t a greater Force, than We &s;uppo&s;e pro|bable to be brought again&s;t it. That the Inhabitants of the I&s;land ex|pre&s;s as much chearfulne&s;s, unanimity, and re&s;olution, for the defence <MILESTONE N="20"> of our Per&s;on, by their whole carriage, and particularly by a Prote&s;ta|tion voluntarily undertaken by them, as can be de&s;ired; and that, if, contrary to expectation, the Rebels &s;hould take the I&s;land, We can from the Ca&s;tle (a place in it &s;elf of very great &s;trength) with the lea&s;t hazard remove our &s;elf to <HI>France;</HI> which in ca&s;e of imminent danger We re&s;olve to do. That our &s;ecurity being thus &s;tated, We be&s;eech her Maje&s;ty to con&s;ider, whether it be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, before any thought of our remove from hence be entertain'd, that We have as clear an information as may be got, of the condition of our Royal Father, and the Affections of <HI>England;</HI> of the re&s;olutions of the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the &s;trength of the Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> of <MILESTONE N="30"> the Affairs in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the conclu&s;ion of the Treaty there; that &s;o, upon a full and mature pro&s;pect upon the whole, We may &s;o di&s;po&s;e of our Per&s;on as may be mo&s;t for the benefit and advantage of our Royal Father; or patiently attend &s;uch an alteration and conjuncture, as may admini&s;ter a greater advantage than is yet offer'd; and whether our remove out of the Dominions of our Royal Father (except upon &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity, or apparent vi&s;ible conveniency) may not have an Influence upon the Affections of the three Kingdoms to the di&s;ad|vantage&endq; of his Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>WITHIN two days after the two Lords were gone for <HI>Paris,</HI> S^r <HI>Dud|ley</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Wyat</HI> arriv'd with the News of the King's being gone out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> before the break of day, only with two Servants, and to what place uncertain; it was believ'd by the Queen, as &s;he &s;aid in her Letter to the Prince, that he was gone for <HI>Ireland,</HI> or to the <HI>Scots;</HI> and therefore her Maje&s;ty renewed her Command for the Prince's immediate repair into <HI>France;</HI> whereas the chief rea&s;on before was, that he would put him&s;elf into the <HI>Scots</HI> hands; and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary that his Highne&s;s &s;hould be in <HI>France,</HI> to go in the head of tho&s;e Forces which &s;hould be immediately &s;ent out of that Kingdom to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE two Lords found the Queen much troubled, that the Prince him|&s;elf came not; <Q>&s;he declared her &s;elf &startq;not to be moved with any rea&s;ons that were, or could be, given for his &s;tay; and that her re&s;olution was&endq;
<PB N="7" REF="290">
po&s;itive and unalterable:</Q> yet they prevailed with her, to re&s;pite any po|&s;itive Declaration till &s;he might receive full adverti&s;ement of the King's condition; who was by this time known to be in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army.</P>
<P>IT is remember'd before, that the Prince, upon his arrival at <HI>Silly,</HI> &s;ent a Gentleman to <HI>Ireland</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as well that he might be punctually inform'd of the State of that Kingdom (of which there were &s;everal reports) as that he might receive from thence a Com|pany or two of Foot, for the better Guard of that I&s;land; which he fore|&s;aw would be nece&s;&s;ary, whether he &s;hould remain there or not. The Gentleman had a very quick pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and came thither very <MILESTONE N="10"> quickly after the Peace was agreed upon with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Roman Catho|licks, and found the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> there; who, after his Enterpri&s;e, and disbanding in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had fir&s;t tran&s;ported him&s;elf into the I&s;le of <HI>Man,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Ireland;</HI> where he had been receiv'd, with great kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity, by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as a Man who had been in &s;o eminent a Po&s;t in the King's Council and Affairs. He was a Per&s;on of &s;o rare a compo&s;ition by Nature and by Art (for Na|ture alone could never have reach'd to it) that he was &s;o far from being ever di&s;maied upon any Misfortune (and greater variety of Misfortunes never befel any Man) that he quickly recollected him&s;elf &s;o vigorou&s;ly, <MILESTONE N="20"> that he did really believe his condition to be improv'd by that ill acci|dent; and that he had an opportunity thereby to gain a new &s;tock of reputation, and honour; and &s;o he no &s;ooner heard of the Prince's be|ing in the I&s;le of <HI>Silly,</HI> and of his condition, and the condition of that place, than he pre&s;ently concluded, that the Prince's pre&s;ence in <HI>Ireland</HI> would &s;ettle and compo&s;e all the factions there; reduce the Kingdom to his Maje&s;ties Service; and oblige the Pope's Nuntio, who was an Enemy to the Peace, to quit his ambitious de&s;igns. The Lord Lieu|tenant had &s;o good an opinion of the Expedient, that he could have been very well contented, that when his Highne&s;s had been forced to <MILESTONE N="30"> leave <HI>England</HI> he had rather cho&s;en to have made <HI>Ireland</HI> than <HI>Silly</HI> his retreat; but, being a Wi&s;e Man, and having many difficulties before him in view, and the apprehen&s;ion of many contingencies which might encrea&s;e tho&s;e difficulties, he would not take upon him to give advice in a point of &s;o great importance; but, forthwith, having a Couple of Frigats ready, he cau&s;ed an hundred Men with their Officers to be pre|&s;ently put on board, according to his Highne&s;s's de&s;ire; and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> (who allways concluded, that that was fit to be done which his fir&s;t thoughts &s;ugge&s;ted to him, and never doubted the Execution of any thing which he once thought fit to be attempted) put him&s;elf on board <MILESTONE N="40"> tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els; re&s;olving, that upon the &s;trength of his own rea&s;on, he &s;hould be able to per&s;wade the Prince, and the Council which attended him, forthwith to quit <HI>Silly,</HI> and to repair to <HI>Dublin;</HI> which, he did not doubt, if brought to pa&s;s in that way, would have been grateful to the Lord Lieutenant. But, by the &s;uddain remove of the Prince from <HI>Silly,</HI> the two Frigats from <HI>Dublin</HI> mi&s;s'd finding him there; and that Lord, who&s;e order they were obliged to ob&s;erve, made all the ha&s;t he could to <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> where he found the Prince, with many other of his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Digby <HI>arrives at</HI> Jer&s;y <HI>from</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> Friends who attended his Highne&s;s, the two Lords being gone but the day before to attend the Queen; he lo&s;t no time in informing his High|ne&s;s <MILESTONE N="50"> of the happy &s;tate and condition of <HI>Ireland;</HI> that the Peace was concluded; and an Army of twelve thou&s;and Men ready to be tran&s;|ported into <HI>England;</HI> of the great Zeal, and Affection the Lord Lieu|tenant
<PB N="8" REF="300">
had for his Service; and that if his Highne&s;s would repair thi|ther, he &s;hould find the whole Kingdom devoted to him; and there|upon, po&s;itively advi&s;ed him, without farther deliberation, to put him|&s;elf aboard tho&s;e Frigats; which were excellent Sailers, and fit for his &s;ecure tran&s;portation.</P>
<P><Q>THE Prince told him, &startq;that it was a matter of greater importance, than was fit to be executed upon &s;o &s;hort deliberation; that he was no &s;ooner arriv'd at <HI>Jer&s;y</HI> than he receiv'd Letters from the Queen his Mo|ther, requiring him forthwith to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> where all things were provided for his reception; that he had &s;ent two of the Lords of the <MILESTONE N="10"> Council to the Queen, to excu&s;e him for not giving ready obedience to her Commands; and to a&s;&s;ure her that he was in a place of unque&s;tion|able Security; in which he might &s;afely expect, to hear from the King his Father before he took any other re&s;olution: That it would be very incongruous now to remove from thence, and to go into <HI>Ireland,</HI> be|fore his Me&s;&s;engers return from <HI>Paris;</HI> in which time, he might rea|&s;onably hope to hear from the King him&s;elf; and &s;o wi&s;h'd him to have&endq; patience till the matter was more ripe for a determination.</Q> This rea|&s;onable An&s;wer gave him no &s;atisfaction; he commended the Prince's aver&s;ne&s;s from going into <HI>France;</HI> <Q>&startq;which, he &s;aid, was the mo&s;t perni|cious Coun&s;el that ever could be given; that it was a thing the King <MILESTONE N="20"> his Father abhorr'd, and never would con&s;ent to; and that he would take upon him&s;elf to write to the Queen, and to give her &s;uch &s;olid ad|vice, and rea&s;ons, that &s;hould infallibly convert her from that de&s;ire, and that &s;hould abundantly &s;atisfy her that his going into <HI>Ireland</HI> was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but that a little delay in the execution of it, might deprive him of all the fruit which was to be expected from that Journey; and therefore, renew'd his advice, and importunity, for lo&s;ing no more&endq; time, but immediately to embark;</Q> which when he &s;aw was not like to prevail with his Highne&s;s, he repaired to one of tho&s;e of the Privy Coun|cil, <MILESTONE N="30"> who attended the Prince, with whom he had a particular friend|&s;hip, and lamented to him, the lo&s;s of &s;uch an occa&s;ion, which would inevitably re&s;tore the King; who would be equally ruin'd if the Prince went into <HI>France;</HI> of which he &s;poke with all the dete&s;tation imaginable; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he was &s;o far &s;atisfied in his Con&s;cience of the benefit that would redound from the one, and the ruin which would inevitably fall out by the other, that, he &s;aid, if the Per&s;on with whom he held this conference, would concur with him, he would carry the Prince into&endq; <HI>Ireland,</HI> even without, and again&s;t his con&s;ent.</Q> <Q>The other Per&s;on an|&s;wer'd, &startq;that it was not to be attempted without his con&s;ent; nor could he imagin it po&s;&s;ible to bring it to pa&s;s, if they &s;hould both endeavour&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> it.</Q> <Q>He replied, &startq;that he would invite the Prince on board the Frigats to a Collation; and that he knew well he could &s;o commend the Ve&s;&s;els to him, that his own curio&s;ity would ea&s;ily invite him to a view of them; and that a&s;&s;oon as he was on board, he would cau&s;e the Sails to&endq; be hoi&s;ted up, and make no &s;tay till he came into <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE other was very angry with him for entertaining &s;uch imagina|tions; <Q>and told him, &startq;&endq;they neither agreed with his Wi&s;dom nor his Duty;</Q> and left him in de&s;pair of his conjunction, and, at the &s;ame time, of be|ing able to compa&s;s it. He had no &s;ooner di&s;charged him&s;elf of this imagination, but in the In&s;tant (as he had a mo&s;t pregnant fancy) he <MILESTONE N="50"> entertain'd another with the &s;ame vigour; and re&s;olv'd, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, to find him&s;elf at <HI>Paris,</HI> not making the lea&s;t que&s;tion but

that he &s;hould convert the Queen, from any farther thought of &s;end|ing for the Prince into <HI>France,</HI> and as ea&s;ily obtain her con&s;ent and ap|probation for his repairing into <HI>Ireland;</HI> and he made as little doubt, with the Queen's help, and by his own dexterity, to prevail with <HI>France</HI> to &s;end a good &s;upply of Money by him into <HI>Ireland;</HI> by which he &s;hould acquire a mo&s;t univer&s;al reputation, and be the mo&s;t welcome Man alive to the Lord Lieutenant: and tran&s;ported with this happy auguration, he left <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> leaving at the &s;ame time his two Ships, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence he goes into</HI> France.</NOTE> his Soldiers, and half a douzen Gentlemen of Quality (who, upon his de&s;ire, and many promi&s;es, had kept him Company from <HI>Ireland)</HI> with|out <MILESTONE N="10"> one penny of Money to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on during his ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>THE noble Per&s;on had that which he mo&s;t de&s;ired; he was pre&s;ently converted, and undertook to the Queen, that he would pre&s;ently con|vert all at <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> and that the Prince &s;hould obey all her Commands; and enter'd into con&s;ultation with her upon the Election of an Emba&s;|&s;adour, and what In&s;tructions &s;hould be given him; which he took upon him&s;elf to prepare. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bellievre</HI> was named by the Queen, whom <MILESTONE N="20"> the Cardinal had de&s;ign'd for that Office. The Cardinal approv'd the In|&s;tructions, and cau&s;ed &s;ix thou&s;and Pi&s;tols to be paid to him, who was to go to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and though it was a much le&s;s Sum than he had pro|mi&s;ed him&s;elf, from the magnificent Expre&s;&s;ions the Cardinal had u&s;ed to him, yet it provided well for his own occa&s;ions; &s;o he left the Queen with his u&s;ual profe&s;&s;ions, and confidence, and accompanied tho&s;e Lords to <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> who were to attend upon his Highne&s;s with her Maje&s;ties Or|ders for the Prince's repair into <HI>France;</HI> for the Advancement whereof the Cardinal was &s;o &s;ollicitous, that he writ a Letter to the old Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> (which he knew he would forthwith &s;end to the Queen; <Q>as he <MILESTONE N="30"> did) in which he &s;aid, &startq;that he had receiv'd very certain adverti&s;ement out of <HI>England,</HI> that there were &s;ome Per&s;ons about the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> who had undertaken to deliver his Highne&s;s up into&endq; the hands of the Parliament for twenty thou&s;and Pi&s;tols;</Q> and this Let|ter was forthwith &s;ent by the Queen to overtake the Lords, that it might be &s;hewed to the Prince; and that they who attended upon him, might di&s;cern, what would be thought of them, if they di&s;&s;waded his Highne&s;s from giving a pre&s;ent obedience to his Mother's Commands.</P>
<P>ASSOON as they came to <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> u&s;ed all the means he could to per&s;wade his Friend to concur in his advice for the Prince's <MILESTONE N="40"> immediate repair into <HI>France.</HI> He told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed between the Cardinal and him, not leaving out any of the Expre&s;&s;ions of the high value his Eminence had of his particular Per&s;on: <Q>&startq;That an Emba&s;|&s;adour was cho&s;en by his advice, and his In&s;tructions drawn by him,&endq; from no part of which the Emba&s;&s;adour dur&s;t &s;werve</Q> (and, which is very wonderful, he did really believe for that time, that he him&s;elf had nominated the Emba&s;&s;adour, and that his In&s;tructions would be exactly ob&s;erv'd by him; &s;o great a power he had allways over him&s;elf, that he could believe any thing which was grateful to him) <Q>&startq;That a War would be pre&s;ently proclaimed upon their refu&s;al to do what the Emba&s;&s;adour <MILESTONE N="50"> required, and that there wanted nothing to the expediting this great Affair, but the Prince's repairing into <HI>France</HI> without farther delay; there being no other que&s;tion concerning that matter, than whether his

Highne&s;s &s;hould &s;tay in <HI>Jer&s;y?</HI> where there could be no que&s;tion of his Security, until he could receive expre&s;s direction from the King his&endq; Father;</Q> and therefore he conjured his Friend to concur in that advice; which would be very grateful to the Queen, and be attended with much benefit to him&s;elf; <Q>telling him &startq;how kind her Maje&s;ty was to him, and how confident &s;he was of his Service, and that if he &s;hould be of another opinion, it would not hinder the Prince from going; who, he knew, was&endq; re&s;olv'd to obey his Mother;</Q> and &s;o concluded his di&s;cour&s;e, with tho&s;e Arguments which he thought were like to make mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on him; and gave him the In&s;tructions by which the Emba&s;&s;adour was to be guided. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P><Q>HIS Friend, who in truth lov'd him very heartily, though no Man better knew his Infirmities, told him, &startq;whatever the Prince would be di&s;po&s;ed to do, he could not change his opinion in point of Coun&s;el, until&endq; the King's plea&s;ure might be known:</Q> <Q>he put him in mind, &startq;how he had been before deceiv'd at <HI>Oxford</HI> by the <HI>Comte de Harcourt,</HI> who was an Emba&s;&s;adour likewi&s;e, as We then thought, named by our &s;elves, and who&s;e In&s;tructions he had likewi&s;e drawn; and yet, he could not but well remember how foully that bu&s;ine&s;s had been ma|naged, and how di&s;obligingly He him&s;elf had been treated by that Em|ba&s;&s;adour; and therefore he could not but wonder, that the &s;ame Ar|tifices <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;hould again prevail with him; and that he could imagine that the In&s;tructions he had drawn, would be at all con&s;ider'd, or pur&s;ued, farther than they might contribute to what the Cardinal for the pre|&s;ent de&s;ign'd; of the integrity whereof, they had no Evidence, but&endq; had rea&s;on enough to &s;u&s;pect it.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> &s;taied at <HI>Paris</HI> with the Queen full three Weeks; having only prevailed with her to &s;u&s;pend her pre&s;ent commands for the Prince's remove from <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> until &s;he &s;hould have clear Intelligence where the King was, and how he was treated, though &s;he declared a po&s;itive re&s;olution that his Highne&s;s &s;hould come <MILESTONE N="30"> to <HI>Paris,</HI> let the Intelligence be what it could be; and, in the end, they were well a&s;&s;ured that his Maje&s;ty had put him&s;elf into the <HI>Scots</HI> Army as it lay before <HI>Newark;</HI> and that, a&s;&s;oon as he came thither, he had cau&s;ed that Garri&s;on to deliver the Town into the hands of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and that thereupon the <HI>Scots</HI> marched pre&s;ently away to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle:</HI> That they had pre&s;s'd the King to do many things, which he had ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to do; and that thereupon they had put very &s;trict Guards upon his Maje&s;ty, and would not permit any Man to repair to him, or to &s;peak with him; &s;o that his Maje&s;ty look'd upon him&s;elf as a Pri|&s;oner, and re&s;olv'd to make another E&s;cape from them a&s;&s;oon as he <MILESTONE N="40"> could. M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> who attended upon him in his Journey from <HI>Oxford</HI> as his &s;ole Servant, was forbid to come any more near him; and if he had not put him&s;elf on board a Ve&s;&s;el, then at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and bound for <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> would have deliver'd him up to the Par|liament. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Montrevil,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Envoy, pretended that they were &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t him for briskly expo&s;tulating with them for their ill Treatment of the King, that it was no longer &s;afe for him to remain in their Quarters, and more dangerous to return to <HI>London;</HI> and therefore, he had likewi&s;e procured a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship to land him in <HI>France,</HI> and was come to <HI>Paris</HI> before the Lords return'd to <HI>Jer&s;y.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE Queen thought now &s;he had more rea&s;on to be confirm'd in her former re&s;olution for the &s;peedy remove of the Prince, and it was pre|tended that he had brought a Letter from the King, which was de|cipher'd

HE was then a young Gentleman of parts very equal to the tru&s;t the Cardinal repo&s;ed in him, and to the Imployment he gave him; and of a Nature not inclined to be made u&s;e of in ordinary di&s;&s;imulation and couzenage. Whil&s;t he took his Mea&s;ures only from the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>London,</HI> and from tho&s;e Presbyterians whom he had op|portunity to conver&s;e with there, he did not give the King the lea&s;t En|couragement to expect a conjunction, or any complayance from the one or the other, upon any cheaper price or condition than the whole al|teration of the Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops, and an entire conformity to the Covenant; and he u&s;ed all the Arguments which oc|curr'd <MILESTONE N="10"> to him, to per&s;wade his Maje&s;ty that all other hopes of Agree|ment with them were de&s;perate; and when he &s;aw his Maje&s;ty unmove|able in that particular, and re&s;olute to undergo the utmo&s;t event of War, before he would wound his peace of mind, and con&s;cience, with &s;uch an odious conce&s;&s;ion, he undertook that Journey we mention'd in the end of the la&s;t year, to di&s;cover whether the &s;ame rude and rigid &s;pirit, which Govern'd tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o the chief Officers of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and that Committee of State that allways remain'd with the Army.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> Army was then before <HI>Newark;</HI> and, in his pa&s;&s;age thi|ther, <MILESTONE N="20"> he waited upon the King at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and was confirm'd in what he had rea&s;on before to be confident of, that it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;i|ble ever to prevail with his Maje&s;ty to give up the Church to the mo&s;t impetuous demands they could make, or to the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity him|&s;elf could be environ'd with; but as to any other conce&s;&s;ions which might &s;atisfy their ambition or their profit, which were allways power|ful and irre&s;i&s;tible Spells upon that Party, he had ample Authority and Commi&s;&s;ion to comply with the mo&s;t extravagant demands from Per|&s;ons like to make good what they undertook, except &s;uch Propo&s;itions as might be mi&s;chievous to the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e;</HI> whom the King <MILESTONE N="30"> re&s;olv'd never to de&s;ert, nor any who had joyn'd with and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him; all which, he de&s;ired to unite to tho&s;e who might now be per&s;waded to &s;erve him. His Maje&s;ty, for his better information, recommended him to &s;ome Per&s;ons who had then Command in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; of who&s;e affections and inclinations to his Service, he had as much confidence, at lea&s;t, as he ought to have; and of their Credit, and Courage, and In|tere&s;t, a greater than was due to them.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Montrevil</HI> came to the Army, and after he had endeavour'd to undeceive tho&s;e who had been per&s;waded to believe, that a perem|ptory and ob&s;tinate in&s;i&s;ting upon the Alteration of the Church Govern|ment <MILESTONE N="40"> (the expectation, and a&s;&s;urance whereof, had indeed fir&s;t enabled them to make that expedition) would at la&s;t prevail over the King's Spirit, as it had done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he found tho&s;e in whom the Power, at lea&s;t the Command of the Army was, much more moderate than he expected, and the Committee which pre&s;ided in the Coun&s;els, rather devi&s;ing and projecting Expedients how they might recede from the rigour of their former demands, than peremptory to adhere to them, and willing he &s;hould believe that they &s;tayed for the coming of the Lord Chancellor out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was daily expected, before they would declare their re&s;olution; not that they were, for the pre&s;ent, <MILESTONE N="50"> without one.

who &s;hould attend him, and his Friends who &s;hould re&s;ort to him; and the principal Officers of the Army &s;poke of that, as a thing they &s;o much wi&s;hed, that it could be in no body's power to hinder it, if there were any who would attempt it; and they who had the greate&s;t power in the conduct of the mo&s;t &s;ecret Coun&s;els, took pains to be thought to have much franker re&s;olutions in that particular, than they thought yet &s;ea&s;onable to expre&s;s in direct Undertakings; and imployed tho&s;e who were known to be mo&s;t entirely tru&s;ted by them, and &s;ome of tho&s;e who had been recommended to him by the King, to a&s;&s;ure him that he might confidently advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to repair to the Army, upon the <MILESTONE N="10"> Terms him&s;elf had propo&s;ed; and that they would &s;end a good Body of their Hor&s;e, to meet his Maje&s;ty at any place he &s;hould appoint to con|duct him in &s;afety to them.

<P>THIS was the proceeding of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Montrevil</HI> in that whole Tran&s;action; and if he were too &s;anguine upon his fir&s;t conver&s;ation with the Officers of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and &s;ome of the Committee, and when he &s;ign'd that Engagement upon the fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> he made ha&s;t to re|tract that confidence, and was in all his di&s;patches afterwards phlegma|tick enough; and, after his Maje&s;ty had put him&s;elf into their hands, he did hone&s;tly and &s;toutly charge all the particular Per&s;ons with the promi&s;es and Engagements they had given to him, and did all he could to make the Cardinal &s;en&s;ible of the indignity that was offer'd to that Crown in the violation of tho&s;e promi&s;es, and Engagements; which <MILESTONE N="30"> was the rea&s;on of his being commanded to return home, a&s;&s;oon as the King came to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> le&s;t his too keen re&s;entment might irritate the <HI>Scots,</HI> and make it appear to the Parliament how far <HI>France</HI> was en|gaged in that whole Negotiation; which the Cardinal had no mind &s;hould appear to the world; and there can be no doubt, but that the cautions and animadver&s;ions which the King receiv'd from <HI>Montrevil</HI> after his Engagement, would have diverted him from that enterpri&s;e, if his Maje&s;ty had di&s;cern'd any other cour&s;e to take that had been pre|ferable even to the hazard that he &s;aw he mu&s;t undergo with the <HI>Scots;</HI> but he was clearly de&s;titute of any other Refuge.

What &s;hould the King do? There <MILESTONE N="10"> was one thing mo&s;t formidable to him, which he was re&s;olv'd to avoid, that was, to be inclo&s;ed in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;o to be given up, or taken, when the Town &s;hould be &s;urrender'd, as a Pri&s;oner to the Indepen|dents Army; which he was adverti&s;ed, from all hands, would treat him very barbarou&s;ly.</P>
<P>IN this perplexity, he cho&s;e rather to commit him&s;elf to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; which yet he did not tru&s;t &s;o far as to give them notice of his Journey, by &s;ending for a party of their Hor&s;e to meet him, as they had profer'd; but early in the morning, upon the 27^t^h day of <HI>April,</HI> he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves</HI> Oxford Apr. 27. 1646.</NOTE> went out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> attended only by <HI>John A&s;hburnham,</HI> and a Divine <MILESTONE N="20"> (one <HI>Hud&s;on)</HI> who under&s;tood the by-ways as well as the common, and was indeed a very skilful Guide.

<P>IT was very early in the morning when the King went to the Ge|neral's lodging, and di&s;cover'd him&s;elf to him; who either was, or &s;eem'd <MILESTONE N="40"> to be, exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed, and confounded at his Maje&s;ties pre&s;ence; and knew not what to &s;ay; but pre&s;ently gave notice of it to the Com|mittee, who were no le&s;s perplexed. An Expre&s;s was pre&s;ently &s;ent to the Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to inform them of the unexpected News, as a thing the <HI>Scots</HI> had not the lea&s;t imagination of.

However, though the King liked not the treatment he receiv'd, he was not without apprehen|&s;ion, that <HI>Fairfax</HI> might be forthwith appointed to decline all other En|terpri&s;es, and to bring him&s;elf near the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, they being too near together already; and therefore he forthwith gave order to the Lord <HI>Bella&s;is</HI> to &s;urrender <HI>Newark,</HI> that the <HI>Scots</HI> might march North|ward; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King or|ders</HI> Newark <HI>to be &s;urren|der'd; where|upon the</HI> Scots <HI>Army marches Northward with the King to</HI> New-Ca|&s;tle.</NOTE> which they re&s;olv'd to do; and he giving up that place, which he could have defended for &s;ome Months longer from that Enemy, upon honourable conditions, that Army with great expedition marched to|wards <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> which the King was glad of, though their behaviour <MILESTONE N="20"> to him was &s;till the &s;ame; and great &s;trictne&s;s u&s;ed that he might not confer with any Man who was not well known to them, much le&s;s re|ceive Letters from any.</P>
<P>IT was an ob&s;ervation in that time, that the fir&s;t publi&s;hing of extra|ordinary News was from the Pulpit; and by the Preacher's Text, and his manner of di&s;cour&s;e upon it, the Auditors might judge, and com|monly fore&s;aw, what was like to be next done in the Parliament or Council of State. The fir&s;t Sermon that was preach'd before the King, after the Army ro&s;e from <HI>Newark</HI> to march Northwards, was upon the 19. <HI>chap.</HI> of the 2 Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> the 41, 42, and 43. <HI>ver&s;es.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<Q><P>41. <HI>And behold, all the men of I&s;rael came to the King, and &s;aid unto the King, Why have our brethren the men of Judah &s;tolen thee away, and have brought the King and his hou&s;hold, and all Davids men with him over Jordan?</HI></P>
<P>42. <HI>And all the men of Judah an&s;wered the men of I&s;rael, Becau&s;e the King is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the Kings co&s;t? or hath he given us any gift?</HI></P>

<P>UPON which words, the Preacher gave Men cau&s;e to believe, that now they had gotten their King they re&s;olv'd to keep him, and to ad|here to him.

<P><Q>HE &s;aid, &startq;he had been lately at <HI>Paris</HI> by the Prince's Command <MILESTONE N="30"> and had receiv'd many graces from the Queen, who had vouch&s;afed to impart all her own rea&s;ons for the Prince's remove, and the grounds for the confidence &s;he had of the Affections of <HI>France;</HI> but, that he did &s;till wonder, if the Court of <HI>France</HI> had &s;o great a de&s;ire, as was pretended, that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould repair thither, that in the two Months time his Highne&s;s had been in <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> they had never &s;ent a Gentleman to &s;ee him, and to invite him to come thither; nor had the&s;e who came now from the Queen, brought &s;o much as a Pa&s;s for him to come into <HI>France:</HI> that he could not but ob&s;erve, that all We had hitherto propo&s;ed to our &s;elves from <HI>France,</HI> had proved in no <MILESTONE N="40"> degree an&s;werable to our expectations; as the five thou&s;and Foot, which We had expected in the We&s;t before the Prince came from thence; and that We had more rea&s;on to be jealous now than ever, &s;ince it had been by the advice of <HI>France,</HI> that the King had now put him&s;elf into the hands of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and therefore We ought to be the more watch|ful&endq; in the di&s;po&s;ing the Per&s;on of the Prince by their advice likewi&s;e.</Q> <Q>He concluded, &startq;that he could not give his advice, or con&s;ent, that the Prince &s;hould repair into <HI>France,</HI> till the King's plea&s;ure might be known, or &s;uch other circum&s;tances might be provided in <HI>France,</HI> as&endq; had been hitherto neglected.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby</HI> and the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> wonder'd very much, <Q>&startq;that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Argu|ment of the Lord</HI> Digby <HI>and Lord</HI> Jer+min <HI>for it</HI></NOTE> there &s;hould be any doubt of the affections of <HI>France,</HI> or that it &s;hould be believ'd that the Queen could be deceiv'd, or not well enough in|form'd&endq;
<PB N="21" REF="430">
in that particular:</Q> They related many particulars which had pa&s;&s;ed between the Cardinal and them in private conferences, and the great profe&s;&s;ions of affection he made to the King. <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;that the Emba&s;&s;adour who was now appointed to go thither, was cho&s;en by the Queen her &s;elf, and had no other In&s;tructions but what &s;he had given him; and that he was not to &s;tay there above a Month; at the end of which he was to denounce War again&s;t the Parliament, if they did not comply with &s;uch propo&s;itions as he made; and &s;o to return; and then, that there &s;hould be an Army of thirty thou&s;and Men im|mediately tran&s;ported into <HI>England,</HI> with the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in the <MILESTONE N="10"> head of them; that the Emba&s;&s;adour was already gone from <HI>Paris,</HI> but was not to embark till he &s;hould fir&s;t receive adverti&s;ement that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was landed in <HI>France;</HI> for that <HI>France</HI> had no rea|&s;on to intere&s;t them&s;elves &s;o far in the King's Quarrel, if the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould refu&s;e to venture his Per&s;on with them; or, it may be,&endq; engage again&s;t them upon another Intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>THEY therefore be&s;ought the Prince, and the Lords, <Q>&startq;that they would con&s;ider well, whether he would di&s;appoint his Father and him|&s;elf of &s;o great fruit as they were even ready to gather, and of which they could not be di&s;appointed but by un&s;ea&s;onable jealou&s;ies of the <MILESTONE N="20"> Integrity of <HI>France,</HI> and by delaying to give them &s;atisfaction in the&endq; remove of the Prince from <HI>Jer&s;y.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THESE Arguments pre&s;s'd with all the a&s;&s;urance imaginable, by Per|&s;ons of that near tru&s;t and confidence with the King, who were not like to be deceiv'd them&s;elves, nor to have any purpo&s;e to deceive the Prince, wrought &s;o far with his Highne&s;s, that he declared <Q>&startq;he would comply&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince re|&s;olves to go into</HI> France.</NOTE> with the Commands of the Queen, and forthwith remove into <HI>France;</HI></Q> which being re&s;olv'd, <Q>he wi&s;hed &startq;there might be no more debate upon that point, but that they would all prepare to go with him, and that there might be as great an Unity in their Coun&s;els, as had hitherto&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> allways been.</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;o po&s;itive Declaration of the Prince of his own Re&s;olution, made all farther Arguments again&s;t it not only u&s;ele&s;s but indecent; <Q>and therefore they replied not to that point, yet every Man of the Coun|cil, the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> only excepted, be&s;ought his Highne&s;s &startq;that <NOTE PLACE="marg">All but one of his Council di&s;|&s;ent, and &s;tay behind.</NOTE> he would give them his Pardon, if they did not farther wait upon him; for they conceiv'd their Commi&s;&s;ion to be now at an end; and that they could not a&s;&s;ume any Authority by it to them&s;elves, if they waited upon him into <HI>France;</HI> nor expect that their coun&s;els there &s;hould be&endq; hearken'd unto, when they were now rejected.</Q> And &s;o, after &s;ome <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;harp replies between the Lords of different judgements, which made the Council break up the &s;ooner, they who re&s;olv'd not to go into <HI>France</HI> took their leaves of the Prince, and ki&s;s'd his hand; his Highne&s;s then declaring, <Q>&startq;that he would be gone the next day by five of the Clock in the morning, though the cro&s;s winds, and want of &s;ome Provi&s;ions which were nece&s;&s;ary for the Journey, detained him there four or five&endq; days longer;</Q> during which time, the di&s;&s;enting Lords every day waited upon him, and were receiv'd by him very graciou&s;ly; his Highne&s;s well knowing and expre&s;&s;ing to them a confidence in their Affections, and that they would be &s;ure to wait upon him, when ever his occa&s;ions <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;hould be ready for their Service. But between them and the other Lords, there grew by degrees &s;o great a &s;trangene&s;s, that, the la&s;t day, they did not &s;o much as &s;peak to each other; they who came from the
<PB N="22" REF="440">
Queen taking it very ill, that the others had pre&s;umed to di&s;&s;ent from what her Maje&s;ty had &s;o po&s;itively commanded. And though they nei|ther loved their Per&s;ons, nor cared for their Company, and without doubt, if they had gone into <HI>France,</HI> would have made them quickly weary of theirs; yet, in that conjuncture, they believ'd that the di&s;&s;ent and &s;eparation of all tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were tru&s;ted by the King with the Per&s;on of the Prince, would bla&s;t their coun&s;el, and weigh down the &s;ingle po&s;itive determination of the Queen her &s;elf.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, the others did not think they were treated in that manner as was due to Per&s;ons &s;o entru&s;ted; but that in truth many ill <MILESTONE N="10"> con&s;equences would re&s;ult from that &s;uddain departure of the Prince out of the King's Dominions, where his re&s;idence might have been &s;e|cure in re&s;pect of the Affairs of <HI>England;</HI> where, be&s;ides the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Silly</HI> and <HI>Pendennis</HI> (which might allways be reliev'd by Sea) there remain'd &s;till within his Maje&s;ties obedience, <HI>Oxford, Worce&s;ter, Walling|ford, Ludlow,</HI> and &s;ome other places of le&s;s name; which, upon any divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, that were naturally to be expected, might have turn'd the Scale: Nor did they know, of what ill con&s;equence it might be to the King, that in &s;uch a conjuncture the Prince &s;hould be removed, when it might be more coun&s;ellable that he &s;hould appear in <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI>'s opinion, which he had deliver'd to the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> wrought very much upon them; for that a Man &s;o entirely tru&s;ted by the King, who had &s;een him as lately as any Body, &s;hould bring no directions from his Maje&s;ty to his Son, and that he &s;hould believe, that it was fitter for the Prince to &s;tay in <HI>Jer&s;y</HI> than to remove into <HI>France,</HI> till his Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure was better under&s;tood, confirm'd them in the judgement they had deliver'd.</P>
<P>BUT there was another rea&s;on that prevailed with tho&s;e who had been made Privy to it, and which, out of Duty to the Queen, they <MILESTONE N="30"> thought not fit to publi&s;h, or in&s;i&s;t upon; it was the In&s;tructions given to <HI>Bellievre</HI> (and which too much manife&s;ted the irre&s;olution her Ma|je&s;ty had) not to in&s;i&s;t upon what they well knew the King would never depart from; for, though that Emba&s;&s;adour was required to do all he could to per&s;wade the Presbyterians to joyn with the King's Party, and not to in&s;i&s;t upon the de&s;truction of the Church, yet if he found that could not be compa&s;&s;ed, He was to pre&s;s, as the advice of the King his Ma&s;ter, his Maje&s;ty to part with the Church, and to &s;atisfy the Presby|terians in that point, as the advice of the Queen his Wife, and of his own Party; which method was afterwards ob&s;erved and pur&s;ued by <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Bellievre;</HI> which tho&s;e Lords perfectly abhorr'd; and thought not fit ever to concur in, or to be privy to tho&s;e Coun&s;els that had begun, and were to carry on that confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>WITHIN a day or two after the Prince's departure from <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> left it likewi&s;e, and went for <HI>England;</HI> the Lords <HI>Capel, Hopton,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, remain'd together in <HI>Jer&s;y</HI> to expect the King's plea&s;ure, and to attend a conjuncture to ap|pear again in his Maje&s;ties Service; of all which they found an oppor|tunity to inform his Maje&s;ty, who very well interpreted all that they had done according to the &s;incerity of their hearts; yet did believe, that <MILESTONE N="50"> if they had likewi&s;e waited upon the Prince into <HI>France,</HI> they might have been able to have prevented or diverted tho&s;e violent pre&s;&s;ures, which were afterwards made upon him from thence, and gave him
<PB N="23" REF="450">
more di&s;quiet than he &s;uffer'd from all the In&s;olence of his Enemies.</P>
<P>IN a word, if the King's Fortune had been farther to be conducted by any fixt Rules of policy and di&s;cretion, and if the current towards his de&s;truction had not run with &s;uch a torrent, as carried down all ob|&s;tructions of &s;obriety and wi&s;dom, and made the confu&s;ion inevitable, it is very probable that this &s;o &s;uddain remove of the Prince from <HI>Jer&s;y</HI> with all the circum&s;tances thereof, might have been look'd upon, and cen&s;ured with &s;everity, as an Action that &s;werv'd from that prudence which by the fundamental Rules of policy had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed; <MILESTONE N="10"> but by the fatal and prodigious Calamities which follow'd, all Coun&s;els of wi&s;e and unwi&s;e Men proving equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, the Memory of what had pa&s;&s;ed before, grew to be the le&s;s thought upon and con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>WHILST the&s;e things were thus tran&s;acted in other parts, the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tran&s;actions relating to the King in the</HI> Scots <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> remain'd yet in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; that people behaving them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, that mo&s;t Men believ'd they would never have parted with his Maje&s;ty till a full Peace had been made. The Parliament made many &s;harp in&s;tances <Q>&startq;that the King might be deliver'd into their hands; and that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army would return into their own Country, having&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> done what they were &s;ent for, and the War being at an end.</Q> To which the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;eem'd to an&s;wer with Courage enough, and in|&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t on tho&s;e Arguments of the King's legal Rights, which had been, in all his Maje&s;ties Declarations, urged again&s;t the Parliaments proceedings; and which indeed could never be an&s;wer'd; and as much condemn'd Them, as the Parliament.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, though the King receiv'd all outward re&s;pect, he was in truth in the condition of a Pri&s;oner; no Servant whom he could tru&s;t &s;uffer'd to come to him; and though many Per&s;ons of Quality who had &s;erv'd the King in the War, when they &s;aw the re&s;olute An&s;wers made by the <HI>Scots,</HI> <Q>&startq;that they neither would nor could compel their&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> King to return to the Parliament,</Q> if his Maje&s;ty had no mind to do &s;o, repaired to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> where his Maje&s;ty was, yet none of them were &s;uffer'd to &s;peak to him; nor could he receive from, or &s;end any Letter to the Queen or Prince; and yet the <HI>Scots</HI> ob&s;erv'd all di&s;tances, and perform'd all the Ceremonies as could have been expected if they had indeed treated him as their King; and made as great profe&s;&s;ion to him of their Duty and good purpo&s;es, <Q>&startq;which they &s;aid they would mani|fe&s;t a&s;&s;oon as it &s;hould be &s;ea&s;onable; and then his Servants, and Friends&endq; &s;hould repair to him with all liberty,</Q> and be well receiv'd: and as they endeavour'd to per&s;wade the King to expect this from them, &s;o they pre|vailed <MILESTONE N="40"> with many Officers of that Army, and &s;ome of the Nobility, to believe that they meant well, but that it was not yet time to di&s;cover their Intentions.</P>
<P>THUS they prevailed with the King to &s;end his po&s;itive Orders to the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King &s;ends to the Mar|quis of</HI> Mon|tro&s;e <HI>to di&s;|band; which he did.</HI></NOTE> Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> who had indeed done Wonders, to lay down his Armes, and to leave the Kingdom; till when, they pretended they could not declare for his Maje&s;ty: and this was done with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, and by a particular Me&s;&s;enger known and tru&s;ted, that the Marquis obeyed, and tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THEN they imployed their <HI>Alexander Hender&s;on,</HI> and their other <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They employ</HI> Hender&s;on <HI>to the King to di&s;pute with him concorn|ing Church Government.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> Clergy, to per&s;wade the King to con&s;ent to the extirpation of Epi&s;co|pacy in <HI>England,</HI> as he had in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and it was, and is &s;till believ'd, that if his Maje&s;ty would have been induced to have &s;atisfied them in

that particular, they would either have had a party in the Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to have been &s;atisfied therewith, or that they would thereupon have declared for the King, and have pre&s;ently joyn'd with the Loyal party in all places for his Maje&s;ties defence. But the King was too con&s;cientious to buy his Peace at &s;o prophane and &s;acrilegious a price as was demanded, and he was &s;o much too hard for M^r <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> in the Argumentation (as appears by the papers that pa&s;&s;ed between them, which were &s;hortly after communicated to the world) that the old Man him&s;elf was &s;o far convinced, and converted, that he had a very deep &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;chief he had him&s;elf been the Author of, or <MILESTONE N="10"> too much contributed to, and lamented it to his neare&s;t Friends, and Confidents; and dyed of grief, and heart-broken, within a very &s;hort <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Hender|&s;on <HI>dyes &s;hort|ly after.</HI></NOTE> time after he departed from his Maje&s;ty.</P>

But he cho&s;e rather to conver&s;e with the principal Leaders of the Presbyterian Party in the Parliament, and with the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners; from who&s;e information he took all his Mea&s;ures; and they a&s;&s;ured him <Q>&startq;that nothing could be done for the King, except he would give up the Church; extirpate Epi&s;copacy; and grant all the Lands belonging to Cathedral Churches to &s;uch u&s;es&endq; as the Parliament &s;hould advi&s;e;</Q> &s;o that, when he came to the King, <MILESTONE N="30"> he pre&s;s'd him very earne&s;tly to that conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides the matter propo&s;ed, in which his Maje&s;ty was un|moveable, he had no e&s;teem of any thing the Emba&s;&s;adour &s;aid to him, having too late di&s;cover'd the little affection the Cardinal had for him, and which he had too much relied upon. For, as hath been already &s;aid, by his advice, and upon his undertaking and a&s;&s;urance that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be well receiv'd in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and that they would be firm to his Intere&s;t, his Maje&s;ty had ventur'd to put him&s;elf into their hands; and he was no &s;ooner there, than all they with whom <HI>Montrevil</HI> had treat|ed, di&s;avow'd their undertaking what the King had been inform'd of; and <MILESTONE N="40"> though the Envoy did avow, and ju&s;tify, what he had inform'd the King, to the faces of the Per&s;ons who had given their Engagements, the Cardi|nal cho&s;e rather to recal, and di&s;countenance the Mini&s;ter of that Crown, than to enter into any expo&s;tulation with the Parliament, or the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>THE Emba&s;&s;adour, by an Expre&s;s, quickly inform'd the Cardinal that the King was too re&s;erv'd in giving the Parliament &s;atisfaction; and therefore wi&s;hed, <Q>&startq;that &s;ome body might be &s;ent over, who was like to have &s;o much credit with his Maje&s;ty as to per&s;wade him to what was&endq; nece&s;&s;ary for his Service.</Q> Upon which, the Queen, who was never advi&s;ed by tho&s;e who either under&s;tood, or valued his true Intere&s;t, con|&s;ulted <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> William D'avenant <HI>&s;ent from the Queen to the King to per|&s;wade him to give up the Church.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> with tho&s;e about her; and &s;ent S^r <HI>William D'avenant,</HI> an hone&s;t Man, and a witty, but in all re&s;pects inferior to &s;uch a tru&s;t, with a Letter of credit to the King (who knew the Per&s;on well enough under

<P>SIR <HI>William D'avenant</HI> had, by the countenance of the <HI>French</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;adour, ea&s;y admi&s;&s;ion to the King; who heard him patiently all he had to &s;ay, and an&s;wer'd him in that manner that made it evident he was not plea&s;ed with the advice.

<P>AS all Men's expectations from the Courage and Activity of the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour in <HI>England,</HI> were thus fru&s;trated, by his mean and low carriage both towards the Parliament and at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> &s;o all the profe&s;&s;ions which had been made of re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s towards the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> when his Per&s;on &s;hould once appear in <HI>France,</HI> were as unworthily di&s;appointed. The Prince had been above two Months <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince's treatment when He came into</HI> France</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> with the Queen his Mother, before any Notice was taken of his being in <HI>France,</HI> by the lea&s;t Me&s;&s;age &s;ent from the Court to congratulate his arrival there; but that time was &s;pent in debating the formalities of his reception; how the King &s;hould treat him? and how he &s;hould behave him&s;elf towards the King? whether he &s;hould take place of Mon&s;ieur the King's Brother? and what kind of Ceremonies &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd between the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and his Uncle the Duke of <HI>Orleans?</HI> and many &s;uch other particulars; in all which they were re&s;olv'd to give the Law them&s;elves; and which had been fitter to have been adju&s;ted in <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> before he put him&s;elf into their power, than di&s;puted afterwards <MILESTONE N="50"> in the Court of <HI>France;</HI> from which there could be then no Appeal.</P>
<P>THERE can be no doubt but that the Cardinal, who was the &s;ole Mini&s;ter of State, and directed all that was to be done, and dictated all
<PB N="26" REF="480">
that was to be &s;aid, did think the pre&s;ence of the Prince there of the highe&s;t importance to their affairs; and did all that was in his power, to per&s;wade the Queen that it was as nece&s;&s;ary for the affairs of the King her Husband, and of her Maje&s;ty: but now that work was over, and the Per&s;on of the Prince brought into their power, without the lea&s;t publick Act or Ceremony to invite him thither, it was no le&s;s his care that the Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and the Officers of the Army, whom he fear'd more than the Parliament, &s;hould believe that the Prince came thither without their wi&s;h, and in truth again&s;t their will; that the Crown of <HI>France</HI> could not refu&s;e to interpo&s;e, and mediate, to make <MILESTONE N="10"> up the difference between the Parliament and the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, and that the Kingdoms might be re&s;tored to Peace; but that when they had perform'd that office of Mediation, they had perform'd their Function; and that they would no more pre&s;ume to take upon them to judge be|tween the Parliament and the <HI>Scots,</HI> than they had done between the King and the Parliament; and that &s;ince the Prince had come to the Queen his Mother, from which they could not rea&s;onably re&s;train him, it &s;hould not be attended with any prejudice to the Peace of <HI>England;</HI> nor &s;hould he there find any means, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to di&s;turb it. And it was believ'd by tho&s;e who &s;tood at no great di&s;tance from affairs, that <MILESTONE N="20"> the Cardinal then laid the foundation for that friend&s;hip which was &s;hortly after built up between him and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> by promi&s;ing <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould receive le&s;s inconvenience by the Prince's remaining in&endq; <HI>France,</HI> than if he were in any other part of <HI>Europe.</HI></Q> And it can hard|ly be believ'd, with how little re&s;pect they treated him during the whole time of his &s;tay there. They were very careful that he might not be look'd upon as &s;upported by them either according to his dignity, or for the maintenance of his Family; but a mean addition to the Pen&s;ion which the Queen had before was made to her Maje&s;ty, without any mention of the Prince her Son; who was wholely to depend upon her <MILESTONE N="30"> Bounty, without power to gratify and oblige any of his own Servants; that they likewi&s;e might depend only upon the Queen's goodne&s;s and favour, and &s;o behave them&s;elves accordingly.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Scots</HI> had &s;ecured the peace and quiet of their own Coun|try, by disbanding the Forces under the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> and by his tran&s;porting him&s;elf beyond the Seas, and by putting to death &s;e|veral Per&s;ons of Name who had follow'd the Marquis, and had been taken Pri&s;oners, among whom S^r <HI>Robert Spot&s;wood</HI> was one, a worthy hone&s;t loyal Gentleman, and as wi&s;e a Man as that Nation had at that time (whom the King had made Secretary of State of that Kingdom, <MILESTONE N="40"> in the place of the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> who was then in Armes again&s;t him; which, it may be, was a principal cau&s;e that the other was put to death) And when they had with &s;uch &s;olemnity and re&s;olution made it plain and evident, that they could not, without the mo&s;t barefaced violation of their Faith and Allegiance, and of the fundamental princi|ple of Chri&s;tian Religion, ever deliver up their Native King, who had put him&s;elf into their hands, into the hands of the Parliament, again&s;t his own Will and Con&s;ent: <Q>And when the Earl of <HI>Lowden</HI> had publick|ly declared to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament in a conference, &startq;that an eternal infamy would lie upon them, and the whole Nation, if they <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;hould deliver the Per&s;on of the King; the &s;ecuring of which was equal|ly their duty, as it was the Parliament's, and the di&s;po&s;al of his Per&s;on in order to that &s;ecurity did equally belong to Them as to the Parlia|ment;&endq;</Q>

however, they &s;aid, &startq;they would u&s;e all the per&s;wa&s;ion, and all the importunity they could with the King that his Maje&s;ty might yield,&endq; and con&s;ent to the Propo&s;itions the Parliament had &s;ent to him.</Q></P>
<P>THE Parliament had, upon the fir&s;t notice of the King's being arriv'd in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, &s;ent a po&s;itive Command to the Committee of both Kingdoms re&s;iding in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, that the Per&s;on of the King &s;hould be forthwith &s;ent to <HI>Warwick</HI> Ca&s;tle; but the <HI>Scots,</HI> who apprehended they could not be long without &s;uch an Order, had, within two days after his Maje&s;ties coming to them, and after he had cau&s;ed <HI>Newark</HI> to be deliver'd up, with wonderful expedition marched towards <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> and were arriv'd there before they receiv'd that Order for &s;end|ing his Maje&s;ty to <HI>Warwick;</HI> which proceeding of theirs, plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty very well, among many other things which di&s;plea&s;ed him; and per&s;waded him, that though they would ob&s;erve their own method, they would, in the end, do &s;omewhat for his Service.</P>
<P>UPON the receiving that Order, they renew'd their profe&s;&s;ions to the Parliament of ob&s;erving punctually all that had been agreed between them; and be&s;ought them, <Q>&startq;that &s;ince they had promi&s;ed the King, before he left <HI>Oxford,</HI> to &s;end Propo&s;itions to him, they would now do it; and &s;aid, that if he refu&s;ed to comply with them, to which they&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;hould per&s;wade him, they knew what they were to do.</Q> Then they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King, upon the</HI> Scots <HI>de&s;ire, &s;ends Orders for the Surrender of</HI> Oxford, <HI>and all his other Garri&s;ons.</HI></NOTE> advi&s;ed the King, and prevailed with him, to &s;end Orders to the Go|vernour of <HI>Oxford</HI> to make conditions, and to &s;urrender that place (where his Son the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was, and all the Council) into the hands of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who with his Army then be&s;ieged them; and likewi&s;e to publi&s;h a general Order (which they cau&s;ed to be printed) <Q>&startq;that all Go|vernours of any Garri&s;ons for his Maje&s;ty, &s;hould immediately deliver them up to the Parliament upon fair and honourable Conditions, &s;ince his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd in all things to be advi&s;ed by his Parliament; and till this was done, they &s;aid, they could not declare them&s;elves in that <MILESTONE N="30"> manner for his Maje&s;ties Service, and Intere&s;t, as they re&s;olv'd to do; for that they were, by their Treaty and Confederacy, to &s;erve the Par|liament in &s;uch manner as they &s;hould direct, until the War &s;hould be ended; but, that done, they had no more obligations to the Par|liament; and that, when his Maje&s;ty had no more Forces on foot, nor Garri&s;ons which held out for him, it could not be denied but that the War was at an end; and then they could &s;peak and expo&s;tulate with&endq; freedom.</Q> By which arts, they prevailed with the King to &s;end, and publi&s;h &s;uch Orders as afore&s;aid; and which indeed, as the ca&s;e then &s;tood, he could have receiv'd little benefit by not publi&s;hing. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THE Parliament was contented, as the more expedite way (though <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment, upon the</HI> Scots <HI>re|que&s;t, &s;ends Propo&s;itions of Peace to the King at</HI> New-Ca&s;tle, <HI>about th$ end of</HI> July.</NOTE> they were much offended at the pre&s;umption of the <HI>Scots</HI> in neglecting to &s;end the King to <HI>Warwick)</HI> to &s;end their Propo&s;itions to the King (which they knew his Maje&s;ty would never grant) by Commi&s;&s;ioners of both Hou&s;es, who had no other Authority, or power, than <Q>&startq;to demand&endq; a po&s;itive An&s;wer from the King in ten days,</Q> and then to return. The&s;e Propo&s;itions were deliver'd about the end of <HI>July;</HI> and contain'd &s;uch an eradication of the Government of the Church and State, that the King told them, <Q>&startq;he knew not what An&s;wer to make to them, till <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maje&s;ties An&s;wer.</NOTE> he &s;hould be inform'd what Power or Authority they had left to him,&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> and his Heirs,</Q> when he had given all that to them which they de&s;ired. <Q>He de&s;ired, &startq;that he might be removed to &s;ome of his own Hou&s;es, and that he might re&s;ide there till, upon a Per&s;onal Treaty with his

Parliament, &s;uch an agreement might be e&s;tabli&s;hed as the Kingdom might enjoy peace and happine&s;s under it; which, he was &s;ure, it could&endq; never do by the conce&s;&s;ions they propo&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots,</HI> who were enough convinced that his Maje&s;ty could ne|ver be wrought upon to &s;acrifice the Church to their wild lu&s;ts and im|piety, were as good as their words to the Parliament, and u&s;ed all the rude importunity and Threats to his Maje&s;ty, to per&s;wade him freely to con&s;ent to all: though they confe&s;&s;ed <Q>&startq;that the Propo&s;itions were higher in many things than they approv'd of, yet they &s;aw no other means for him to clo&s;e with his Parliament, than by granting what&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> they required.</Q></P>
<P>THE Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> told him, <Q>&startq;that the con&s;equence of his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>in|force the Par|liament Pro|po&s;itions by their Chancel|lor.</HI></NOTE> An&s;wer to the Propo&s;itions, was as great, as the ruin, or pre&s;ervation of his Crown or Kingdoms: That the Parliament after many bloody Battles, had got the &s;trong-holds and Forts of the Kingdom into their hands: that they had his Revenue, Exci&s;e, A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, Seque&s;trations, and power to rai&s;e all the Men and Money of the Kingdom: that they had gained Victory over all, and that they had a &s;trong Army to main|tain it; &s;o that they might do what they would with Church or State: that they de&s;ired neither Him, nor any of his race, longer to reign <MILESTONE N="20"> over them; and had &s;ent the&s;e Propo&s;itions to his Maje&s;ty, without the granting whereof, the Kingdom and his People could not be in &s;afety: that if he refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;ent, he would lo&s;e all his Friends in Par|liament, lo&s;e the City, and lo&s;e the Country; and that all <HI>England</HI> would joyn again&s;t him as one Man to proce&s;s, and depo&s;e him, and to &s;et up another Government; and &s;o, that both Kingdoms, for ei|thers &s;afety, would agree to &s;ettle Religion and Peace without him,&endq; to the ruin of his Maje&s;ty, and his Po&s;terity:</Q> and concluded, <Q>&startq;that if he left <HI>England,</HI> he would not be admitted to come and reign in&endq; <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>AND it is very true that the General A&s;&s;embly of the Kirk, which was then &s;itting in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had petition'd the Con&s;ervators of the Peace of the Kingdom, <Q>&startq;that if the King &s;hould refu&s;e to give &s;atisfaction to&endq; his Parliament,</Q> he might not be permitted to come into <HI>Scotland.</HI> This kind of Argumentation did more provoke than per&s;wade the King; he told them, with great Re&s;olution, and Magnanimity, <Q>&startq;that no con|dition <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maje&s;ties An&s;wer to them.</NOTE> they could reduce him to, could be half &s;o mi&s;erable, and grievous to him, as that which they would per&s;wade him to reduce him&s;elf to; and therefore, bid them proceed their own way; and&endq; that though they had all for&s;aken him, God had not.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"></P>

<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> now begun again to talk &s;turdily, and denied <Q>&startq;that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had power ab&s;olutely to di&s;po&s;e of the Per&s;on&endq; of the King without their approbation;</Q> and the Parliament as loudly replied, <Q>&startq;that they had nothing to do in <HI>England,</HI> but to ob&s;erve their&endq; Orders;</Q> and added &s;uch threats to their rea&s;ons, as might let them &s;ee they had a great contempt of their power, and would exact obedience from them, if they refu&s;ed to yield it. But the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es were only kept up till they could adju&s;t all Accounts between them, and agree <MILESTONE N="10"> what price they &s;hould pay for the delivery of His Per&s;on whom one &s;ide was re&s;olv'd to have, and the other as re&s;olv'd not to keep; and &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>agree to deli|ver up the King.</HI></NOTE> they agreed; and, upon the payment of two hundred thou&s;and pounds in hand, and &s;ecurity for as much more upon days agreed upon, the <HI>Scots</HI> deliver'd the King up into &s;uch hands as the Parliament appointed to receive him.</P>
<P>IN this infamous manner that excellent Prince was, in the end of <HI>January,</HI> given up, by his <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, to tho&s;e of his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who were intru&s;ted by the Parliament to receive him; which had appointed a Committee of Lords and Commons, to go to the place agreed upon <MILESTONE N="20"> with a Party of Hor&s;e and Foot of the Army, which were &s;ubject to the Orders of that Committee, and the Committee it &s;elf to go to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> to receive that Town as well as the King; where, and to whom, his Maje&s;ty was deliver'd.</P>
<P>THEY receiv'd him with the &s;ame formality of re&s;pect as he had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commit|tee appointed by the Parlia|ment receive the King at</HI> New-Ca&s;tle <HI>in the end of</HI> January.</NOTE> been treated with by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and with the &s;ame &s;trictne&s;s re&s;train'd all re&s;ort of tho&s;e to his Maje&s;ty, who were of doubtful affections to them, and their Cau&s;e.

And, in this di&s;tribution, the Presbyterian Party in the Hou&s;es did what they plea&s;ed, and were thought to govern all. The Independents craftily letting them enjoy that confidence of their power and intere&s;t, till they had di&s;mi&s;s'd their Friends, the <HI>Scots,</HI> out of the Kingdom; and permitting them to put Men of their principles about the Per&s;on of the King, and to choo&s;e &s;uch a Guard as they could confide in, to attend his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>OF the Committee imploied to govern and direct all, Major General <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Brown</HI> was one, who had a great Name and Intere&s;t in the City, and with all the Presbyterian Party, and had done great Service to the Par|liament in the War under the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and was a diligent and &s;tout Commander. In this manner, and with this attendance, his Ma|je&s;ty was brought to his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Holmby</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire;</HI> a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King is brought to</HI> Holmby</NOTE> place he had taken much delight in: And there he was to &s;tay till the Parliament and the Army (for the Army now took upon them to have a &s;hare, and to give their opinion in the &s;ettlement that &s;hould be made) &s;hould determine what &s;hould be farther done.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the Committee paid all re&s;pects to his Maje&s;ty; <MILESTONE N="50"> and he enjoyed tho&s;e Exerci&s;es he mo&s;t delighted in; and &s;eem'd to have all liberty, but to confer with Per&s;ons he mo&s;t de&s;ired, and to have &s;uch Servants about him as he could tru&s;t. That which mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ed him,
<PB N="30" REF="520">
was, that they would not permit him to have his own Chaplains; but order'd Presbyterian Mini&s;ters to attend for Divine Service: and his Maje&s;ty, utterly refu&s;ing to be pre&s;ent at their Devotions, was com|pelled at tho&s;e hours to be his own Chaplain in his Bed-Chamber; where he con&s;tantly u&s;ed the Common Prayer by him&s;elf. His Maje&s;ty bore this con&s;traint &s;o heavily that he writ a Letter to the Hou&s;e of Peers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de|&s;ires certain of his Chaplains; is refu&s;ed.</NOTE> in which he inclo&s;ed a Li&s;t of the Names of thirteen of his Chaplains; any two of which he de&s;ired might have liberty to attend him for his Devotion. To which, after many days con&s;ideration, they return'd this An&s;wer; <Q>&startq;that all tho&s;e Chaplains were di&s;affected to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd <MILESTONE N="10"> Government of the Church, and had not taken the Covenant; but that there were others who had, who, if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed, &s;hould be &s;ent&endq; to him.</Q> After this An&s;wer, his Maje&s;ty thought it to no purpo&s;e to importune them farther in that particular; but, next to the having his own Chaplains, he would have been be&s;t plea&s;ed to have been without any; they who were &s;ent by them, being Men of mean parts and of mo&s;t impertinent and trouble&s;ome Confidence and Importunity.</P>
<P>WHILST tho&s;e Di&s;putes continued between the Parliament and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers Garri|&s;ons Surren|der'd to the Parliament.</NOTE> <HI>Scots</HI> concerning the King's Per&s;on, the Army proceeded with great Suc|ce&s;s in reducing tho&s;e Garri&s;ons which &s;till continued in his Maje&s;ties <MILESTONE N="20"> obedience; whereof though &s;ome &s;urrender'd more ea&s;ily and with le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance than they might have made, &s;atisfying them&s;elves with the King's general Order, and that there was no rea&s;onable expectation of relief, and therefore that it would not be ami&s;s, by an early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to obtain better conditions for them&s;elves; yet others defended them|&s;elves with notable ob&s;tinacy to the la&s;t, to the great damage of the Enemy, and to the detaining the Army from uniting together; with|out which they could not pur&s;ue the great de&s;igns they had. And this was one of the rea&s;ons that made the Treaty with the <HI>Scots</HI> depend &s;o long, and that the Presbyterians continued their Authority and Credit <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;o long; and We may ob&s;erve again, that tho&s;e Garri&s;ons which were maintain'd, and defended with the greate&s;t courage and virtue, in the end, obtain'd, as good and as honourable conditions, as any of tho&s;e who &s;urrender'd upon the fir&s;t Summons.</P>
<P>THIS was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Ragland</HI> and <HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca&s;tles; which en|dured the longe&s;t Sieges, and held out the la&s;t of any Forts or Ca&s;tles in <HI>England;</HI> being bravely defended by two Per&s;ons of very great Age; but were at length deliver'd up within a day or two of each other. <HI>Ragland</HI> was maintain'd, with extraordinary Re&s;olution and Courage, by the old Marquis of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Fairfax</HI> him&s;elf, till it was <MILESTONE N="40"> reduced to the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. <HI>Pendennis</HI> refu&s;ed all Summons; ad|mitting no Treaty, till all their Provi&s;ions were &s;o far con&s;umed, that they had not Victual left for four and twenty hours; and then they treated, and carried them&s;elves in the Treaty with &s;uch re&s;olution, and unconcernedne&s;s, that the Enemy concluded they were in no &s;treights; and &s;o gave them the conditions they propo&s;ed; which were as good as any Garri&s;on in <HI>England</HI> had accepted. This Ca&s;tle was defended by the Governour thereof, <HI>John Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> an old Gentleman of near four&s;core years of age, and of one of the be&s;t E&s;tates and Intere&s;t in that County; who, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Son <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Richard Arundel</HI> (who was then a Colonel in the Army; a &s;tout and diligent Officer; and was by the King after his return made a Baron, Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice,</HI> in memory of his Father's Service, and his

own eminent behaviour throughout the War) maintain'd, and defended the &s;ame to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>THERE remain'd with him in that Service many Gentlemen of the Country of great Loyalty, among&s;t whom S^r <HI>Harry Killigrew</HI> was one; who, being an intimate Friend of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, re|&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> and, a&s;&s;oon as the Ca&s;tle was Surrender'd, took the fir&s;t opportunity of a Ve&s;&s;el then in the Harbour of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> to tran&s;port him&s;elf with &s;ome Officers and Soldiers to S^t <HI>Maloes</HI> in <HI>Bri|tany;</HI> from whence he writ to the Chancellor in <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> that he would procure a Bark of that I&s;land to go to S^t <HI>Maloes</HI> to fetch him thither; <MILESTONE N="10"> which, by the kindne&s;s of S^r <HI>George Carteret,</HI> was pre&s;ently &s;ent, with a longing de&s;ire to receive him into that I&s;land; the two Lords, <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Hopton,</HI> and the Governour, having an extraordinary affection for him, as well as the Chancellor. Within two days after, upon view of the Ve&s;&s;el at Sea (which they well knew) they all made ha&s;t to the Har|bour to receive their Friend; but, when they came thither, to their in|finite regret they found his Body there in a Coffin, he having dyed at S^t <HI>Maloes</HI> within a day after he had written his Letter.</P>
<P>AFTER the Treaty was &s;ign'd for delivering the Ca&s;tle, he had walked out to di&s;charge &s;ome Armes which were in his Chamber; among which, <MILESTONE N="20"> a Carrabine that had been long charged, in the &s;hooting off, broke; and a &s;plinter of it &s;truck him in the forehead; which, though it drew much blood, was not apprehended by him to be of any danger; &s;o that his Friends could not per&s;wade him to &s;tay there till the wound was cured; but, the blood being &s;topp'd, and the Chirurgeon having bound it up, he pro&s;ecuted his intended Voyage; and at his landing at S^t <HI>Maloes,</HI> he writ that Letter; believing his wound would give him little trouble. But his Letter was no &s;ooner gone than he &s;ent for a Chirurgeon; who, opening the wound, found it was very deep and dangerous; and the next day he dyed, having de&s;ired that his dead Body might be &s;ent to <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> where he was decently buried. He was a very Gallant Gentle|man, of a noble Extraction, and a fair Revenue in Land; of excellent Parts and Courage; he had one only Son, who was killed before him in a Party that fell upon the Enemies Quarters near <HI>Bridgewater;</HI> where he behaved him&s;elf with remarkable Courage, and was generally la|mented.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Harry</HI> was of the Hou&s;e of Commons; and though he had no other relation to the Court than the having many Friends there, as wherever he was known he was exceedingly belov'd, he was mo&s;t zealous and pa&s;&s;ionate in oppo&s;ing all the extravagant proceedings of the Par|liament. <MILESTONE N="40"> And when the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was cho&s;en General, and the &s;e|veral Members of the Hou&s;e &s;tood up, and declared, what Hor&s;e they would rai&s;e, and maintain, and that they would live and dye with the Earl their General, one &s;aying he would rai&s;e ten Hor&s;es, and another twenty, He &s;tood up and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he would provide a good Hor&s;e, and a good Buff Coat, and a good pair of Pi&s;tols, and then he doubted not&endq; but he &s;hould find a good Cau&s;e;</Q> and &s;o went out of the Hou&s;e, and rode Po&s;t into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where his E&s;tate and Intere&s;t lay; and there joyn'd with tho&s;e Gallant Gentlemen his Friends, who fir&s;t receiv'd the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and rai&s;ed tho&s;e Forces which did &s;o many famous Actions <MILESTONE N="50"> in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>HE would never take any Command in the Army; but they who had, con&s;ulted with no man more. He was in all actions, and in tho&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="540">
places where was mo&s;t danger, having great Courage and a plea&s;antne&s;s of humour in danger that was very exemplary; and they who did not do their duty, took care not to be within his view; for he was a very &s;harp Speaker, and cared not for angering tho&s;e who de&s;erv'd to be re|prehended. The <HI>Arundels, Trelawnies, Slannings, Trevanions,</HI> and all the &s;ignal Men of that County, infinitely loved his Spirit, and &s;ince|rity; and his Credit and Intere&s;t had a great influence upon all but tho&s;e who did not love the King; and to tho&s;e, he was very terrible; and exceedingly hated by them; and not loved by Men of moderate tem|pers; for he thought all &s;uch prepared to Rebel, when a little &s;ucce&s;s <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hould encourage them; and was many times too much offended with Men who wi&s;h'd well, and who&s;e con&s;titutions and complections would not permit them to expre&s;s the &s;ame frankne&s;s, which his Nature and keenne&s;s of Spirit could not &s;uppre&s;s. His lo&s;s was much lamented by all good Men.</P>
<P>FROM the time that the King was brought to <HI>Holmby,</HI> and whil&s;t he &s;tayed there, he was afflicted with the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ures concerning the Church, which had di&s;quieted him at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> the Parliament not remitting any of their in&s;olencies in their demands: all which was im|puted to the Presbyterians, who were thought to exerci&s;e the whole <MILESTONE N="20"> power, and begun to give Orders for the le&s;&s;ening their great Charge by disbanding &s;ome Troops of their Army, and &s;ending others for <HI>Ireland;</HI> which they made no doubt &s;peedily to reduce; and declared, <Q>&startq;that they would then disband all Armies, that the Kingdom might be govern'd&endq; by the known Laws.</Q></P>
<P>THIS temper in the Hou&s;es rai&s;ed another Spirit in the Army; which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences ari&s;e between the Parlia|ment and the Army.</NOTE> did neither like the Presbyterian Government that they &s;aw ready to be &s;ettled in the Church, nor that the Parliament &s;hould &s;o ab&s;olutely di&s;|po&s;e of them, by whom they had gotten power to do all they had done; and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who had the &s;ole influence upon the Army, under hand <MILESTONE N="30"> made them Petition the Hou&s;es again&s;t any thing that was done con|trary to his opinion. He him&s;elf, and his Officers, took upon them to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers Sects increa&s;e in the Army.</NOTE> Preach and Pray publickly to their Troops; and admitted few or no Chaplains in the Army, but &s;uch as bitterly inveighed again&s;t the Pre&s;|byterian Government, as more Tyrannical than Epi&s;copacy; and the Common Soldiers, as well as the Officers, did not only Pray, and Preach among them&s;elves, but went up into the Pulpits in all Churches, and Preached to the People; who quickly became in&s;pired with the &s;ame Spirit; Women as well as Men taking upon them to Pray and Preach; which made as great a noi&s;e and confu&s;ion in all opinions concerning Re|ligion, <MILESTONE N="40"> as there was in the Civil Government of the State; &s;carce any Man being &s;uffer'd to be called in que&s;tion for delivering any opinion in Religion, by &s;peaking or writing, how Prophane, Heretical, or Bla&s;|phemous &s;oever it was; <Q>&startq;&endq;which, they &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;&endq;was to re&s;train the Spirit.</Q></P>
<P>LIBERTY of Con&s;cience was now the Common Argument and Quarrel, whil&s;t the Presbyterian Party proceeded with equal bitterne&s;s again&s;t the &s;everal Sects as Enemies to all Godline&s;s, as they had done, and &s;till continued to do, again&s;t the Prelatical Party; and finding them|&s;elves &s;uperior in the two Hou&s;es, little doubted, by their Authority and Power there, to be able to reform the Army, and to new moddel it <MILESTONE N="50"> again; which they would, no doubt, have attempted, if it had not plea&s;ed God to have taken away the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;ome Months before <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>dyed in</HI> Sept. <HI>this year.</HI></NOTE> this; who dyed without being &s;en&s;ible of &s;ickne&s;s, in a time when he
<PB N="33" REF="550">
might have been able to have undone much of the mi&s;chief he had for|merly wrought; to which he had great inclinations; and had indigna|tion enough for the indignities him&s;elf had receiv'd from the ungrateful Parliament, and wonderful apprehen&s;ion, and dete&s;tation of the ruin he &s;aw like to befall the King, and the Kingdom. And it is very probable, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent temper of the City at that time, and of the two Hou&s;es, he might, if he had lived, have given &s;ome check to the rage and fury that then prevailed. But God would not &s;uffer a Man, who, out of the pride and vanity of his nature, rather than the wickedne&s;s of his heart, had been made an In&s;trument of &s;o much mi&s;chief, to have <MILESTONE N="10"> any &s;hare in &s;o glorious a work; though his con&s;titution, and temper, might very well incline him to the Lethargick indi&s;po&s;ition of which he dyed, yet it was loudly &s;aid by many of his Friends, <Q>&startq;that he was&endq; Poy&s;on'd.</Q></P>
<P>SURE it is that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Party (for he was now declared head of the Army, though <HI>Fairfax</HI> continued General in name) were wonderfully exalted with his death; he being the only Per&s;on who&s;e Credit and Intere&s;t they fear'd without any e&s;teem of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>AND now, that they might more &s;ub&s;tantially enter into di&s;pute, and competition with the Parliament, and go a &s;hare with them in <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;ettling the Kingdom (as they called it) the Army erected a kind of Par|liament among them&s;elves. They had, from the time of the defeat of the King's Army, and when they had no more Enemy to contend with in the Field, and after they had purged their Army of all tho&s;e incon|venient Officers, of who&s;e entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and obedience to all their dictates, they had not confidence, &s;et a&s;ide, in effect, their &s;elf denying Ordinance, and got their principal Officers of the Army, and others of their Friends, who&s;e principles they well knew, to be elected Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons into their places who were dead, or who had been expell'd by them for adhering to the King. By this means, <HI>Fair|fax</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> him&s;elf, <HI>Ireton, Harri&s;on,</HI> and many other of the Independents, Officers and Gentlemen, of the &s;everal Counties, who were tran&s;ported with new fancies in Religion, and were called by a new name <HI>Fanaticks,</HI> &s;ate in the Hou&s;e of Commons; notwith&s;tanding all which, the Presby|terians &s;till carried it.</P>
<P>BUT about this time, that they might be upon a nearer Level with the Parliament, the Army made choice of a number of &s;uch Officers as they liked; which they called the General's Council of Officers; who were to re&s;emble the Hou&s;e of Peers; and the Common Soldiers made choice of three or four of each Regiment, mo&s;t Corporals or Serjeants, few or none above the degree of an En&s;ign, who were called Agitators, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Agitators, as well as a Coun|cil of Officers, appointed by the Army.</NOTE> and were to be as a Hou&s;e of Commons to the Council of Officers. The&s;e two Repre&s;entatives met &s;everally, and con&s;ider'd of all the Acts and Orders made by the Parliament towards &s;ettling the Kingdom, and towards reforming, dividing, or disbanding of the Army: and, upon mutual Me&s;&s;ages and Conferences between each other, they re&s;olv'd in the fir&s;t place, and declared, <Q>&startq;that they would not be divided, or di&s;|banded, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fir&s;t Re|&s;olutions.</NOTE> before their full Arrears were paid, and before full Provi&s;ion was made for Liberty of Con&s;cience; which, they &s;aid, was the ground of the Quarrel, and for which &s;o many of their Friends lives had been <MILESTONE N="50"> lo&s;t, and &s;o much of their own Blood had been &s;pilt; and that hi|therto there was &s;o little &s;ecurity provided in that point, that there was a greater per&s;ecution now again&s;t Religious and Godly Men, than
<PB N="34" REF="560">
ever had been in the King's Government, when the Bi&s;hops were their&endq; Judges.</Q></P>
<P>THEY &s;aid, <Q>&startq;they did not look upon them&s;elves as a Band of <HI>Jani|zaries,</HI> hired and entertained only to Fight their Battles; but that they had voluntarily taken up Armes for the Liberty and Defence of the Nation of which they were a part; and before they laid down tho&s;e Armes, they would &s;ee all tho&s;e ends well provided for, that the People might not hereafter undergo tho&s;e grievances which they had formerly &s;uffer'd. They complain'd that &s;ome Members of the Army had been &s;ent for by the Parliament, and committed to Pri&s;on, which <MILESTONE N="10"> was again&s;t their Privilege; &s;ince all Soldiers ought to be tryed by a Council of War, and not by any other Judicatory; and therefore they de&s;ired redre&s;s in the&s;e, and many other particulars of as ingrateful a Nature; and that &s;uch as were Impri&s;on'd and in Cu&s;tody, might be forthwith &s;et at Liberty; without which they could not think them|&s;elves&endq; ju&s;tly dealt with: and with this Declaration and Addre&s;s,</Q> they &s;ent three or four of their own Members to the Hou&s;e of Commons; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which they de|liver'd to the Parliament:</NOTE> who deliver'd it at the Bar with wonderful Confidence.</P>
<P>THE Soldiers publi&s;h'd a vindication, as they call'd it, of their Pro|ceedings and Re&s;olutions, and directed it to their General; in which <MILESTONE N="20"> they complain'd of a de&s;ign to disband, and new model the Army; <Q>&startq;&endq;which, they &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;was a Plot contriv'd by &s;ome Men who had lately ta&s;ted of Soveraignty; and, being lifted up above the ordinary Sphere of Servants, endeavour'd to become Ma&s;ters, and were degenerated&endq; into Tyrants.</Q> They therefore declared, <Q>&startq;that they would neither be imployed for the Service of <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor &s;uffer them&s;elves to be di&s;|banded, till their de&s;ires were granted, and the Rights and Liberties&endq; of the Subjects &s;hould be vindicated,</Q> and maintain'd. This Apology, or Vindication, being &s;ign'd by many inferior Officers, the Parliament declared them to be Enemies to the State; and cau&s;ed &s;ome of them, <MILESTONE N="30"> who talked loude&s;t, to be impri&s;on'd. Upon which a new Addre&s;s was <NOTE PLACE="marg">And to their General.</NOTE> made to their General; wherein they complain'd <Q>&startq;how di&s;dainfully they were u&s;ed by the Parliament, for whom they had ventured their Lives, and lo&s;t their Blood: that the Privileges which were due to them as Soldiers, and as Subjects, were taken from them; and when they com|plain'd of the Injuries they receiv'd, they were abu&s;ed, beaten, and&endq; dragg'd into Goals.</Q></P>
<P>HEREUPON, the General was prevailed with to write a Letter to a Member of Parliament, who &s;hew'd it to the Hou&s;e; in which he took notice of &s;everal Petitions, which were prepared in the City of <HI>London,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> and &s;ome other Counties of the Kingdom, again&s;t the Army; and <Q>&startq;that it was look'd upon as very &s;trange, that the Officers of the Army might not be permitted to petition, when &s;o many Petitions were re|ceiv'd again&s;t them; and that he much doubted that the Army might draw to a Rendezvous, and think of &s;ome other way for their own&endq; vindication.</Q></P>
<P>THIS manner of proceeding by the Soldiers, but e&s;pecially the Ge|neral &s;eeming to be of their mind, troubled the Parliament; yet they re&s;olv'd not to &s;uffer their Coun&s;els to be cen&s;ured, or their Actions controled, by tho&s;e who were retained by them, and who lived upon <MILESTONE N="50"> their pay. And therefore, after many high Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the pre|&s;umption of &s;everal Officers and Soldiers, they declared, <Q>&startq;that who|&s;oever <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment's Decla|ration there|upon.</NOTE> &s;hould refu&s;e, being commanded, to engage him&s;elf in the&endq;
<PB N="35" REF="570">
Service of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;hould be disbanded.</Q> The Army was re&s;olv'd not to be &s;ubdued in their fir&s;t &s;o declared Re&s;olution, and fell into a direct and high Mutiny, and called for the Arrears of pay due to them; which they knew where and how to Levy for them&s;elves; nor could they be in any degree appea&s;ed, till the Declaration that the Parliament had made again&s;t them, was ra&s;ed out of the Journal Book of both Hou&s;es, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Afterward ra&s;ed out of their Books.</NOTE> and a Months pay &s;ent to them; <Q>nor were they &s;atisfied with all this, but talked very loud, &startq;that they knew how to make them&s;elves as con|&s;iderable as the Parliament, and where to have their Service better va|lued,&endq; and rewarded;</Q> which &s;o frighted tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> that <MILESTONE N="10"> they appointed a Committee of Lords and Commons, whereof &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee appointed by the two Hou&s;es to treat with a Committee of the Army.</NOTE> were very acceptable to the Army, to go to them, and to treat with a Committee cho&s;en of the Officers of the Army, upon the be&s;t expe|dients that might be applied to the compo&s;ing the&s;e di&s;tempers. Now the Army thought it &s;elf upon a Level with the Parliament, when they had a Committee of the one authori&s;ed to treat with a Committee of the other; which likewi&s;e rai&s;ed the Spirits of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who had never thought of oppo&s;ing or di&s;obeying the Parliament; and di&s;po&s;ed him to more concurrence with the impetuous humour of the Army, when he &s;aw it was &s;o much complied with and &s;ubmitted to by all Men. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>CROMWELL, hitherto, carried him&s;elf with that rare di&s;&s;imulation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell<HI>'s behaviour at fir&s;t in the&s;e Mutinies.</HI></NOTE> (in which &s;ure he was a very great Ma&s;ter) that he &s;eem'd exceedingly incen&s;ed again&s;t this In&s;olence of the Soldiers; was &s;till in the Hou&s;e of Commons when any &s;uch addre&s;&s;es were made; and inveighed bitterly again&s;t the pre&s;umption, and had been the Cau&s;e of the Commitment, of &s;ome of the Officers. He propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that the General might be &s;ent&endq; down to the Army;</Q> who, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;would conjure down this mu|tinous&endq; Spirit quickly;</Q> and he was &s;o ea&s;ily believ'd, that he him&s;elf was &s;ent once or twice to compo&s;e the Army; where after he had &s;tayed two or three days, <Q>he would again return to the Hou&s;e, and complain <MILESTONE N="30"> heavily &startq;of the great Licence that was got into the Army; that, for his own part, by the Artifice of his Enemies, and of tho&s;e who de&s;ired that the Nation &s;hould be again imbrew'd in Blood, he was render'd &s;o odious unto them, that they had a purpo&s;e to kill him, if, upon&endq; &s;ome di&s;covery made to him, he had not e&s;caped out of their hands.</Q> And in the&s;e, and the like di&s;cour&s;es, when he &s;pake of the Nation's be|ing to be involv'd in new troubles, he would weep bitterly, and appear the mo&s;t afflicted Man in the world with the &s;en&s;e of the Calamities which were like to en&s;ue. But, as many of the wi&s;er &s;ort had long di&s;|cover'd his wicked intentions, &s;o his hipocri&s;y could not longer be con|cealed. <MILESTONE N="40"> The mo&s;t active Officers and Agitators were known to be his own Creatures, and &s;uch who neither did, nor would do, any thing but by his direction. So that it was privately re&s;olv'd by the principal Per|&s;ons of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that when he came the next day into the Hou&s;e, which he &s;eldom omitted to do, they would &s;end him to the Tower; pre&s;uming, that if they had once &s;ever'd his Per&s;on from the Army, they &s;hould ea&s;ily reduce it to its former temper and obe|dience. For they had not the lea&s;t jealou&s;y of the General <HI>Fair&s;ax,</HI> whom they knew to be a perfect Presbyterian in his judgement; and that <HI>Crom|well</HI> had the a&s;cendent over him purely by his di&s;&s;imulation, and pretence <MILESTONE N="50"> of con&s;cience and &s;incerity. There is no doubt <HI>Fair&s;ax</HI> did not then, nor long after, believe, that the other had tho&s;e wicked de&s;igns in his heart again&s;t the King, or the lea&s;t imagination of di&s;obeying the Parliament.</P>

THIS purpo&s;e of &s;ei&s;ing upon the Per&s;on of <HI>Cromwell</HI> could not be carried &s;o &s;ecretly, but that he had notice of it; and the very next morn|ing after he had &s;o much lamented his de&s;perate misfortune in having lo&s;t all reputation, and credit, and authority in the Army, and that his life would be in danger if he were with it, when the Hou&s;e expected every minute his pre&s;ence, they were inform'd that he was met out of the Town by break of day, with one Servant only, on the way to the Army; where he had appointed a Rendezvous of &s;ome Regiments of the Hor&s;e, and from whence he writ a Letter to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, <Q>&startq;that having the night before receiv'd a Letter from &s;ome Of|ficers <MILESTONE N="10"> of his own Regiment, that the jealou&s;y the Troops had conceiv'd of him, and of his want of kindne&s;s towards them, was much abated, &s;o that they believ'd, if he would be quickly pre&s;ent with them, they would all in a &s;hort time by his advice be reclaim'd, upon this he had made all the ha&s;t he could; and did find that the Soldiers had been abu&s;ed by mi&s;information; and that he hoped to di&s;cover the fountain from whence it &s;prung; and in the mean time de&s;ired that the General, and the other Officers in the Hou&s;e, and &s;uch as remain'd about the Town, might be pre&s;ently &s;ent to their Quarters; and that he believ'd it would be very nece&s;&s;ary in order to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the late di&s;tem|pers, <MILESTONE N="20"> and for the prevention of the like for the time to come, that there might be a general Rendezvous of the Army; of which the Ge|neral would be&s;t con&s;ider, when he came down; which he wi&s;hed&endq; might be ha&s;ten'd.</Q> It was now to no purpo&s;e to di&s;cover what they had formerly intended, or that they had any jealou&s;y of a Per&s;on who was out of their reach; and &s;o they expected a better conjuncture; and in few days after, the General and the other Officers left the Town, and went to their Quarters.</P>

And as this Letter from the General admini&s;ter'd too much cau&s;e of jealou&s;y of what was to &s;ucceed, &s;o a po&s;itive information about the &s;ame time by many Officers, confirm'd by a Letter which the Lord Mayor of <HI>Lon|don</HI> had receiv'd, that the whole Army was upon its march, and would be in <HI>London</HI> the next day by noon, &s;o di&s;tracted them that they ap|pear'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Di&s;tractions at</HI> We&s;tmin|&s;ter <HI>upon no|tice of the Ar|mies coming towards</HI> Lon|don.</NOTE> be&s;ides them&s;elves: <Q>however, they Voted, &startq;that the Hou&s;es <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hould &s;it all the next day, being <HI>Sunday;</HI> and that M^r <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> &s;hould be there to pray for them: That the Committee of &s;afety &s;hould &s;it up all that night to con&s;ider what was to be done: That the Lines of Communication &s;hould be &s;trongly guarded, and all the Train'd-bands&endq; of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be drawn together upon pain of death.</Q> All Shops were &s;hut up, and &s;uch a General confu&s;ion over all the Town, and in the faces of all Men, as if the Army had already enter'd the Town. <Q>The Parliament writ a Letter to the General, de&s;iring him, &startq;that no part of the Army might come within five and twenty miles of <HI>London;</HI> and that the King's Per&s;on might be deliver'd to the former Commi&s;|&s;ioners, <MILESTONE N="20"> who had attended upon his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Holmby;</HI> and that Co|lonel <HI>Ro&s;&s;iter,</HI> and his Regiment, might be appointed for the Guard&endq; of his Per&s;on.</Q> <Q>The General return'd for An&s;wer, &startq;that the Army was come to S^t <HI>Albans</HI> before the de&s;ire of the Parliament came to his hands; but that, in obedience to their Commands, he would advance no farther; and de&s;ired that a Month's pay might pre&s;ently be &s;ent for&endq; the Army.</Q> In which they defer'd not to gratify them; though as to the redelivery of the King to the former Commi&s;&s;ioners, no other An|&s;wer was return'd, than <Q>&startq;that they might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that all care &s;hould&endq; be taken for his Maje&s;ties &s;ecurity.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>FROM that time both <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> appear'd in the Council of Officers, which they had never before done; and their Expo&s;tula|tions with the Parliament, begun to be more brisk, and contumacious than they had been.

All re&s;traint was taken off from Per&s;ons re&s;orting to him, and he &s;aw every day the Faces of many <MILESTONE N="40"> who were grateful to him; and he no &s;ooner de&s;ired that &s;ome of his Chaplains might have leave to attend upon him for his Devotion, but it was yielded to, and they who were named by him (who were D^r <HI>Shel|don,</HI> D^r <HI>Morley,</HI> D^r <HI>Sander&s;on,</HI> and D^r <HI>Hammond)</HI> were pre&s;ently &s;ent, and gave their attendance and perform'd their Function at the ordinary hours, in their accu&s;tom'd formalities; all Per&s;ons who had a mind to it, being &s;uffer'd to be pre&s;ent, to his Maje&s;ties infinite &s;atisfaction; who begun to believe that the Army was not &s;o much his Enemy as it was reported to be; and the Army had &s;ent an Addre&s;s to him full of Pro|te&s;tation of duty, and be&s;ought him <Q>&startq;that he would be content, for <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;ome time, to re&s;ide among them, until the affairs of the Kingdom were put into &s;uch a Po&s;ture as he might find all things to his own content, and &s;ecurity; which they infinitely de&s;ired to &s;ee a&s;&s;oon as&endq;

<P>THE Parliament at this time had recover'd its Spirit, when they &s;aw the Army did not march nearer towards them, and not only &s;topp'd at S^t <HI>Albans,</HI> but was drawn back to a farther di&s;tance; which per&s;waded <MILESTONE N="20"> them, that their General was di&s;plea&s;ed with the former advance: and &s;o they proceeded with all pa&s;&s;ion, and vigour, again&s;t tho&s;e principal Officers, who, they knew, contrived all the&s;e Proceedings. They pub|li&s;hed Declarations to the Kingdom, <Q>&startq;that they de&s;ired to bring the King in honour to his Parliament; which was their bu&s;ine&s;s from their beginning, and that he was detain'd Pri&s;oner again&s;t his Will in the Army; and that they had great rea&s;on to apprehend the &s;afety of his&endq; Per&s;on.</Q> The Army, on the other hand, declared <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty was neither Pri&s;oner, nor detain'd again&s;t his Will; and appeal'd to his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, and to all his Friends, who had liberty to repair to <MILESTONE N="30"> him, whether he had not more liberty, and was not treated with more re&s;pect, &s;ince he came into the Army than he had been at <HI>Holmby,</HI> or during the time he remain'd in tho&s;e places, and with that retinue that&endq; the Parliament had appointed?</Q> The City &s;eem'd very unanimou&s;ly de|voted <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;actions in the City upon tho&s;e oc|ca&s;ions.</NOTE> to the Parliament, and incen&s;ed again&s;t the Army; and &s;eem'd re&s;olute, not only with their Train'd-bands and Auxiliary Regiments to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and defend the Parliament, but appointed &s;ome of the old Officers who had &s;erv'd under the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and had been disbanded under the new Model, as <HI>Waller, Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> and others, to li&s;t new Forces; towards which there was not like to be want of Men out of their old <MILESTONE N="40"> Forces, and &s;uch of the King's as would be glad of the imployment. There was nothing they did really fear &s;o much, as that the Army would make a firm conjunction with the King, and unite with his Party, of which there was &s;o much &s;hew; and many unskilful Men, who wi&s;hed it, bragg'd too much; and therefore the Parliament &s;ent a Committee to his Maje&s;ty, with an Addre&s;s of another Style than they had lately u&s;ed, with many profe&s;&s;ions of Duty; and declaring, <Q>&startq;that if he was not, in all re&s;pects, treated as he ought to be, and as he de&s;ired, it was not Their fault, who de&s;ired he might be at full liberty, and do&endq; what he would;</Q> hoping that the King would have been induced to <MILESTONE N="50"> de&s;ire to come to <HI>London,</HI> and to make complaint of the Armies having taken him from <HI>Holmby;</HI> by which they believ'd the King's Party would be di&s;abu&s;ed, and withdraw their hopes of any good from

the Army; and then, they thought, they &s;hould be hard enough for them.</P>
<P>THE King was in great doubt how to carry him&s;elf; he thought him|&s;elf &s;o barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed by the Presbyterians, and had &s;o ill an opinion of all the principal Per&s;ons who govern'd them, that he had no mind to put him&s;elf into their hands. On the other &s;ide, he was far from being &s;atisfied with the Armies good intentions towards him; and though many of his Friends were &s;uffer'd to re&s;ort to him, they found that their being long about him, would not be acceptable; and though the Of|ficers and Soldiers appear'd, for the mo&s;t part, civil to him, they were all at lea&s;t as vigilant, as the former Guards had been; &s;o that he could <MILESTONE N="10"> not, without great difficulty, have got from them if he had de&s;ired it. <HI>Fairfax</HI> had been with him, and ki&s;s'd his hand, and made &s;uch Pro|fe&s;&s;ions as he could well utter; which was with no advantage in the de|livery; his Authority was of no u&s;e, becau&s;e he re&s;ign'd him&s;elf entirely to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who had been, and <HI>Ireton</HI> likewi&s;e, with the King, with|out either of them offering to ki&s;s his hand; otherwi&s;e, they behaved them&s;elves with good manners towards him. His Maje&s;ty u&s;ed all the Addre&s;s he could towards them to draw &s;ome promi&s;e from them, but they were &s;o re&s;erv'd, and &s;tood &s;o much upon their Guard, and u&s;ed &s;o few words, that nothing could be concluded from what they &s;aid: <MILESTONE N="20"> they excu&s;ed them&s;elves <Q>&startq;for not &s;eeing his Maje&s;ty often, upon the great jealou&s;ies the Parliament had of them, towards whom they pro|fe&s;s'd&endq; all fidelity.</Q> The Per&s;ons who re&s;orted to his Maje&s;ty, and brought Advices from others who dur&s;t not yet offer to come them&s;elves, brought &s;everal opinions to him; &s;ome thinking the Army would deal &s;incerely with his Maje&s;ty, others expecting no better from them than they afterwards perform'd: &s;o that the King well concluded that he would neither reject the Parliament Addre&s;&s;es by any neglect, nor di&s;|oblige the Army by appearing to have jealou&s;y of them, or a de&s;ire to be out of their hands; which he could hardly have effected, if he had <MILESTONE N="30"> known a better place to have re&s;orted to. <Q>So he de&s;ired both Parties &startq;to ha&s;ten their Con&s;ultations, that the Kingdom might enjoy Peace and Happine&s;s; in which he &s;hould not be without a &s;hare; and he&endq; would pray to God to bring this to pa&s;s a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>THE News of the King's being in the Army, of his freedom in the exerci&s;e of his Religion, which he had been &s;o long without, and that &s;ome of his Servants, with whom he was well plea&s;ed had liberty to at|tend upon him, made every Body abroad, as well as tho&s;e at home, hope well; and the King him&s;elf writ to the Queen, as if he thought his condition much better than it had been among the <HI>Scots.</HI> S^r <HI>John</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Berkley</HI> after his &s;urrender of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and the &s;pending his &s;ix Months allowed by the Articles to &s;ollicite his affairs where he would, had tran&s;|ported him&s;elf into <HI>France,</HI> and waited upon the Queen at <HI>Paris,</HI> being &s;till a menial Servant to her Maje&s;ty, and having a Friend in that Court that govern'd, and loved him better than any Body el&s;e did. A&s;&s;oon as the reports came thither of the King's being with the Army, he repeated many di&s;cour&s;es he had held with the Officers of the Army, whil&s;t they treated with him of the delivery of <HI>Exeter;</HI> <Q>how he had told them, &startq;upon how &s;lippery ground they &s;tood; that the Parliament, when they had &s;erved their turn, would di&s;mi&s;s them with reproach, and <MILESTONE N="50"> give them very &s;mall rewards for the great Service they had done for them; that they &s;hould do well, &s;ea&s;onably to think of a &s;afe retreat,

<P>ASHBURNHAM had, by &s;ome Friends, a recommendation both to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> who knew the credit he had with the King, and that his Maje&s;ty would be very well plea&s;ed to have his attendance, and look upon it as a Te&s;timony of their re&s;pect to him. They knew like|wi&s;e that he was an implacable Enemy to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and no Friend to the other Presbyterians, and though he had &s;ome ordinary craft in in|&s;inuating, he was of no deep and piercing judgement to di&s;cover what was not unwarily expo&s;ed, and a free &s;peaker of what he imagined: &s;o <MILESTONE N="50"> they likewi&s;e left Him at liberty to repair to the King; and the&s;e two Gentlemen came near about the &s;ame time to his Maje&s;ty, when the Army was drawing together, with a purpo&s;e, which was not yet publi&s;h'd,
<PB N="42" REF="640">
of marching to <HI>London;</HI> his Maje&s;ty being &s;till quarter'd in tho&s;e places which were more proper for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THEY were both welcome to his Maje&s;ty, the one bringing a &s;pecial recommendation from the Queen, and, to make him&s;elf the more va|luable, a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty <Q>&startq;that he was &s;ent for by the Officers of the Army, as one they would tru&s;t, and that they had receiv'd him with open Armes; and, without any &s;cruple, gave him leave to wait upon&endq; him: The other, needed no recommendation,</Q> the King's own incli|nations di&s;po&s;ing him to be very gracious to him; and &s;o his Maje&s;ty wi&s;h'd them <Q>&startq;to corre&s;pond with each other, and to conver&s;e with his <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;everal Friends, who did not yet think fit to re&s;ort to him; and to receive their advice; to di&s;cover as much as they could of the Inten|tions of both Parties, and impart what was fit to the King, till, upon&endq; a farther di&s;covery, his Maje&s;ty might better judge what to do.</Q> The&s;e two were the principal Agents (they conferring with all his Maje&s;ties Friends, and, as often as they de&s;ired, with the Officers of the Army) upon who&s;e Information, and Advice, his Maje&s;ty principally depended, though they rarely conferr'd together with the &s;ame Per&s;ons, and never with any of the Officers, who pretended not to tru&s;t one another enough to &s;peak with that freedom before each other, as they would to one of <MILESTONE N="20"> them; and their Acquaintance among the Officers not being principally with the &s;ame Men, their Informations and advices were often very different, and more perplexed than informed his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE very high conte&s;ts between the Parliament and the Army, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The different de&s;igns of the Parliament and Army at this time re|lating to the King.</NOTE> which neither &s;ide could be per&s;waded to yield to the other, or abate any of their a&s;perity, made many prudent Men believe that both &s;ides would, in the end, be willing to make the King the Umpire; which neither of them ever intended to do. The Parliament thought that their Name and Authority, which had carried them through &s;o great under|takings, and reduced the whole Kingdom to their obedience, could not <MILESTONE N="30"> be overpower'd by their own Army, rai&s;ed and paid by them&s;elves, and to who&s;e Dictates the People would never &s;ubmit. They thought the King's pre&s;ence among&s;t them, gave them all their pre&s;ent reputa|tion; and were not without apprehen&s;ion that the Ambition of &s;ome of the Officers, and their malice to the Parliament, when they &s;aw that they could obtain their ends no other way, might di&s;po&s;e them to an entire conjunction with the King's Party and Intere&s;t; and then, all the Penalties of Trea&s;on, Rebellion, and Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, mu&s;t be di&s;charged at their co&s;ts; and therefore they labour'd, by all the publick and private means they could, to per&s;wade the King to own his being detain'd Pri|&s;oner <MILESTONE N="40"> by the Army again&s;t his Will, or to withdraw him&s;elf by &s;ome way from them, and repair to <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and, in either of tho&s;e Ca&s;es, they did not doubt, fir&s;t, to divide the Army (for they &s;till believ'd the General fa&s;t to them) and by degrees to bring them to rea&s;on, and to be disbanded, as many as were not nece&s;&s;ary for the Service of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and then, having the King to them&s;elves, and all his Party being ob|noxious to tho&s;e penalties for their Delinquency, they &s;hould be well able, by gratifying &s;ome of the greate&s;t Per&s;ons of the Nobility with immunity and indemnity, to &s;ettle the Government in &s;uch a manner, as to be well recompenced for all the Adventures they had made, and <MILESTONE N="50"> hazards they had run.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the Army had no dread of the Authority and Power of the Parliament; which they knew had been &s;o far pro&s;tituted,
<PB N="43" REF="650">
that it had lo&s;t mo&s;t of its reverence with the People. But it had great apprehen&s;ion, that, by its conjunction with the City, it might indeed recover credit with the Kingdom, and withhold the pay of the Army, and thereby make &s;ome Divi&s;ion among&s;t them; and if the Per&s;on of the King &s;hould be likewi&s;e with them, and thereby his Party &s;hould likewi&s;e joyn with them, they &s;hould be to begin their work again, or to make their Peace with tho&s;e who were as much provoked by them as the King him&s;elf had been. And therefore they were &s;en&s;ible that they enjoyed a pre&s;ent benefit by the King's being with them, and by their treating him with the outward re&s;pect that was due to his Maje&s;ty, and <MILESTONE N="10"> the civilities they made profe&s;&s;ion of towards all his Party, and the per|mi&s;&s;ion of his Chaplains, and other Servants, to re&s;ort to him; and cul|tivated all the&s;e Artifices with great Addre&s;s, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, or di&s;coun|tenancing the Tyranny of the Presbyterians in the Country Committees, and all other places, where they exerci&s;ed notable rigour again&s;t all who had been of the King's Party, or not enough of theirs (for Neuters found no excu&s;e for being of no Party) When they found it fit to make any lu&s;ty Declaration again&s;t the Parliament, and exclaim again&s;t their Ty|rannical proceedings again&s;t the Army, they allways in&s;erted &s;omewhat that might look like candour and tenderne&s;s towards the King's Party, <MILESTONE N="20"> complain'd of <Q>&startq;the Affront, and Indignity done to the Army by the Parliament's not ob&s;erving the Articles which had been made upon &s;urrender of Garri&s;ons, but proceeding again&s;t tho&s;e on who&s;e behalf tho&s;e Articles were made, with more &s;everity than was agreeable to ju&s;tice, and to the Intention of the Articles; whereby the honour and faith of the Army &s;uffer'd, and was complain'd of; all which, they&endq; &s;aid, they would have remedied.</Q> Whereupon many hoped that they &s;hould be excu&s;ed from making any compo&s;itions, and entertain'd &s;uch other imaginations as plea&s;ed them&s;elves, and the other Party well liked; knowing they could demoli&s;h all tho&s;e Structures a&s;&s;oon as they receiv'd <MILESTONE N="30"> no benefit by them them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE King had, during the time he &s;tayed at <HI>Holmby,</HI> writ to the Hou&s;e of Peers, that his Children might have leave to come to him, and to re&s;ide for &s;ome time with him. From the time that <HI>Oxford</HI> had been &s;urrender'd, upon which the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had fallen into their hands, for they would by no means admit that he &s;hould have liberty to go to &s;uch place as the King &s;hould direct, which was very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed, and in&s;i&s;ted on by the Lords of the Council there, as long as they could; but appointed their Committee to receive him with all re&s;pect, and to bring him to <HI>London;</HI> from that time, I &s;ay, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was <MILESTONE N="40"> committed to the care of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> together with the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and the Prince&s;s, who had been by the King left under the tuition of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> but from the Death of that Counte&s;s the Parliament had pre&s;umed, that they might be &s;ure to keep them in their power, to put them into the Cu&s;tody of the Lady <HI>Vere,</HI> an old Lady much in their favour, but not at all ambitious of that charge, though there was a competent allowance a&s;&s;ign'd for their &s;upport. They were now removed from her, and placed all together with the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who receiv'd, and treated them, in all re&s;pects, as was &s;uitable to their Birth, and his own Duty; but could <MILESTONE N="50"> give them no more liberty to go abroad, than he was, in his In&s;tructions from the Parliament, permitted to do; and they had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to gratify the King in that particular; of which his Maje&s;ty no &s;ooner
<PB N="44" REF="660">
took notice to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> than he writ a Letter to the Parliament, <Q>&startq;that the King much de&s;ired to have the fight and company of his Children; and that if they might not be allow'd to be longer with him, that at&endq; lea&s;t they might dine with him;</Q> and he &s;ent them word that, on &s;uch a day, <Q>&startq;the King, who attended the motion of the Army and was quar|ter'd&endq; only where they plea&s;ed, would dine at <HI>Maidenhead.</HI></Q> There his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King al|low'd to &s;ee his Children at</HI> Maiden|head <HI>and</HI> Caver&s;ham.</NOTE> Children met him, to his infinite content and joy; and he being to quarter and &s;tay &s;ome time at <HI>Caver&s;ham,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Craven</HI>'s, near <HI>Reading,</HI> his Children were likewi&s;e &s;uffer'd to go thither, and re|main'd with him two days; which was the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction the King <MILESTONE N="10"> could receive; and the receiving whereof, he imputed to the civility of the General, and the good di&s;po&s;ition of the Army; which made &s;o much the more impre&s;&s;ion upon him, in that he had never made any one Propo&s;ition in which he had been gratified, where the Presbyterian Spirit had power do deny it.</P>
<P>IN the Hou&s;e of Commons, which was now the Scene of all the Action that di&s;plea&s;ed and incen&s;ed the Army (for the Hou&s;e of Peers was &s;hrunk into &s;o incon&s;iderable a Number, and their Per&s;ons not con|&s;iderable after the death of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> except tho&s;e who were affected to, or might be di&s;po&s;ed by the Army) they were wholely <MILESTONE N="20"> guided by <HI>Hollis,</HI> and <HI>Stapleton, Lewis,</HI> and <HI>Glyn,</HI> who had been very popular and notorious from the beginning, and by <HI>Waller,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Brown,</HI> who had &s;erv'd in Commands in the Army, and perform'd at &s;ome times very &s;ignal Service, and were exceedingly belov'd in the City, and two or three others who follow'd their Dictates, and were &s;ub&s;ervient to their Directions. The&s;e were all Men of Parts, Intere&s;t, and &s;ignal Courage, and did not only heartily abhor the Intentions which they di&s;cern'd the Army to have, and that it was wholely to be di&s;po&s;ed according to the de&s;igns of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> but had likewi&s;e declared animo|&s;ities again&s;t the Per&s;ons of the mo&s;t active and powerful Officers; as <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Hollis</HI> had one day, upon a very hot debate in the Hou&s;e, and &s;ome rude expre&s;&s;ions which fell from <HI>Ireton,</HI> per&s;waded him to walk out of the Hou&s;e with him, and then told him, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould pre&s;ently go&endq; over the Water and fight with him.</Q> <HI>Ireton</HI> replying, <Q>&startq;his con&s;cience&endq; would not &s;uffer him to fight a Duel: <HI>Hollis,</HI> in choler, pulled him by the No&s;e;</Q> telling him, <Q>&startq;if his con&s;cience would keep him from giving&endq; Men &s;atisfaction, it &s;hould keep him from provoking them.</Q> This af|front to the third Per&s;on of the Army, and to a Man of the mo&s;t viru|lent, malitious, and revengeful Nature of all the Pack, &s;o incen&s;ed the whole Party, that they were re&s;olv'd one way or other to be rid of him <MILESTONE N="40"> who had that power in the Hou&s;e, and that reputation abroad, that when he could not ab&s;olutely controle their de&s;igns, he did &s;o ob&s;truct them, that they could not advance to any conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THEY re&s;orted therefore to an expedient, which, they had ob&s;erv'd, by the conduct of tho&s;e very Men again&s;t whom they meant to apply it, had brought to pa&s;s all that they de&s;ired; and, in the Council of Of|ficers, prepared an impeachment of High Trea&s;on in general Terms <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army im|peach eleven Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons</NOTE> again&s;t M^r <HI>Hollis,</HI> and the Per&s;ons mention'd before, and others, to the number of eleven Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons. This impeach|ment twelve Officers of the Army, Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels <MILESTONE N="50"> Majors, and Captains, pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e; and within few days af|ter, when they &s;aw the &s;ame Members &s;till inveigh again&s;t and arraign their proceedings, the General and Officers writ a Letter to the Hou&s;e,
<Q><PB N="45" REF="670">
&startq;that they would appoint fit Per&s;ons on their and the Kingdom's be|half, to make good the charge again&s;t tho&s;e Members whom they had accu&s;ed; and that they de&s;ired, that tho&s;e Members impeach'd might be forthwith &s;u&s;pended from &s;itting in the Hou&s;e; &s;ince it could not be thought fit that the &s;ame Per&s;ons who had &s;o much injured and pro|voked&endq; the Army, &s;hould &s;it Judges of their own Actions.</Q> This was an Arrow that the Hou&s;e of Commons did not expect would have been &s;hot out of that Quiver; and though they were un&s;peakably di&s;mayed, and di&s;tracted with this pre&s;umption, they an&s;wer'd po&s;itively, <Q>&startq;that they neither would, nor could, &s;eque&s;ter tho&s;e Members from the <MILESTONE N="10"> Hou&s;e, who had never &s;aid, or done any thing in the Hou&s;e worthy of Cen&s;ure, till proof were made of &s;uch particulars as might render&endq; them guilty.</Q> <Q>But the Officers of the Army replied, &startq;that they could prove them guilty of &s;uch practices in the Hou&s;e, that it would be ju&s;t in the Hou&s;e to &s;u&s;pend them: that by the Laws of the Land, and the Precedents of Parliament, the Lords had, upon the very pre&s;en|tation of a general Accu&s;ation without being reduced in form, &s;e|que&s;ter'd from their Hou&s;e and committed the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and therefore they mu&s;t pre&s;s, and in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;u&s;pending at lea&s;t of tho&s;e accu&s;ed Members from be|ing <MILESTONE N="20"> pre&s;ent in the Hou&s;e, where they &s;tood impeach'd; and without&endq; this, they &s;aid, the Army would not be &s;atisfied.</Q> However the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;eem'd &s;till re&s;olute, the accu&s;ed Members them&s;elves, who be&s;t knew their temper, thought it &s;afer for them to retire, and by forbearing to appear in the Hou&s;e, to allay the heat of the pre&s;ent Conte&s;t.</P>
<P>UPON this &s;o palpable Declen&s;ion of Spirit in the Hou&s;e, the Army &s;eem'd much quieter, and re&s;olv'd to &s;et other Agents on their work, that they might not appear too bu&s;y and active in their own concern|ment. It is very true that the City, upon who&s;e influence the Parlia|ment <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temper of the City and the Changes of their Militia at this time.</NOTE> much depended, appear'd now entirely Presbyterian; the Court of Aldermen, and Common Council, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of Men of that &s;pirit; the Militia of the City was committed to Commi&s;&s;ioners care|fully and factiou&s;ly cho&s;en of that Party; all tho&s;e of another temper having been put out of Tho&s;e Tru&s;ts, at or about the time that the King was deliver'd up by the <HI>Scots,</HI> when the Officers of the Army were con|tent that the Presbyterians &s;hould believe, that the whole power of the Kingdom was in them; and that they might &s;ettle what Government they plea&s;ed: If there remain'd any Per&s;ons in any of tho&s;e imploy|ments in the City, it was by their di&s;&s;imulation, and pretending to have <MILESTONE N="40"> other Affections; mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were notorious to be of any other faction in Religion, had been put out; and liv'd as neglected and di&s;|countenanced Men; who &s;eem'd rather to depend upon the clemency, and indulgence of the State, for their particular liberty in the exerci&s;e of that Religion they adhered to, than to have any hope or ambition to be again admitted into any &s;hare, or part in the Government: yet, af|ter all this di&s;&s;imulation, <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> well knew, that the mul|titude of inferior People were at their di&s;po&s;al, and would appear in any conjuncture they &s;hould think convenient; and that many Aldermen and &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens were quiet, and appear'd not to contradict or <MILESTONE N="50"> oppo&s;e the Presbyterians, only by their directions; and would be ready upon their call. And now, when they &s;aw tho&s;e leading Men, who had govern'd the Parliament, pro&s;ecuted by the Army, and that they forbore
<PB N="46" REF="680">
to come to the Hou&s;e, there flocked together great Numbers of the lowe&s;t, and mo&s;t inferior People, to the Parliament, with Petitions of &s;everal Natures, both with reference to Religion, and to the Civil Go|vernment; with the noi&s;e and clamour whereof, the Parliament was &s;o offended and di&s;turbed, that they made an Ordinance, <Q>&startq;that it &s;hould be criminal to gather, and &s;ollicite the Sub&s;criptions of hands to Pe|titions.&endq;</Q> But this Order &s;o offended all Parties, that they were com|pelled, within two days, to revoke it, and to leave all Men to their na|tural Liberty. Whil&s;t this confu&s;ion was in the City and Parliament, the Commi&s;&s;ioners, which had been &s;ent to the Army to treat with the <MILESTONE N="10"> Officers, had no better &s;ucce&s;s; but return'd with the po&s;itive and de|clared Re&s;olution of the Army, <Q>&startq;that a Declaration &s;hould be publi&s;h'd&endq; by the Parliament again&s;t the coming in of Forreign Force: for they apprehended,</Q> or rather were willing that the People &s;hould apprehend, a new combination by the <HI>Scots:</HI> <Q>&startq;that the Pay of the Army &s;hould be put into a con&s;tant Cour&s;e, and all Per&s;ons who had receiv'd Money, &s;hould be called to an account: that the Militia of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be put into the hands of Per&s;ons well affected, and tho&s;e who had been formerly tru&s;ted: that all Per&s;ons impri&s;on'd for pretended Mi&s;de|meanours, by Order of Parliament, or their Committees, might be <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;et at Liberty; and, if upon tryal they &s;hould be found innocent, that&endq; they might have good reparation.</Q> And they particularly mention'd <HI>John Lilburn, Overton,</HI> and other Anabapti&s;ts and Fanaticks, who had been committed by the Parliament for many &s;editious meetings, un|der pretence of Exerci&s;e of their Religion, and many in&s;olent Actions again&s;t the Government. Upon the report of the&s;e demands, the Par|liament grew more enraged; and voted, <Q>&startq;that the yielding to the Ar|my in the&s;e particulars, would be again&s;t their Honour, and their In|tere&s;t,&endq; and de&s;tructive to their Privileges;</Q> with many expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t their pre&s;umption, and in&s;olence: yet, when a new Rabble of <MILESTONE N="30"> Petitioners demanded, with loud Cries, mo&s;t of the &s;ame things, they were willing to compound with them; and con&s;ented that the Militia of the City of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be put into &s;uch hands as the Army &s;hould de&s;ire.</P>
<P>THE Militia of the City had been in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> &s;hortly after the King's being brought to <HI>Holmby,</HI> &s;ettled with the con&s;ent, and upon the de&s;ire, of the Common Council, by Ordinance of Parliament, in the hands of Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were generally of the Presbyterian Party, they who were of other inclinations being removed; and, as is &s;aid before, &s;eem'd not di&s;plea&s;ed at their di&s;grace; and now, when <MILESTONE N="40"> upon the Declarations and Demands of the Army, &s;econded by cla|morous Petitions, they &s;aw this Ordinance rever&s;ed, in <HI>July,</HI> without &s;o much as con&s;ulting with the Common Council according to cu&s;tome, the City was exceedingly &s;tartled; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that if the imperious Com|mand of the Army, could prevail with the Parliament to rever&s;e &s;uch an Ordinance as that of the Militia, they had rea&s;on to apprehend they might as well repeal the other Ordinances for the &s;ecurity of Money, or for the purcha&s;e of Bi&s;hops and Church Lands, or what&s;oever el&s;e&endq; that was the proper &s;ecurity of the Subject.</Q> And therefore they cau&s;ed a Petition to be prepared in the name of the City, to be pre&s;ented <MILESTONE N="50"> by the two Sheriffs, and others deputed by the Common Council to that purpo&s;e. But, before they were ready, many thou&s;ands, Apprentices and young Citizens, brought Petitions to the Parliament; in which
<PB N="47" REF="690">
they &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that the Command of the Militia of the City was the Birth|right of the City, and belonged to them by &s;everal Charters which had been confirm'd in Parliament; for defence whereof, they &s;aid, they had ventur'd their Lives as far and as frankly as the Army had done; and therefore, they de&s;ired that the Ordinance of Parliament of the fourth of <HI>May,</HI> which had pa&s;&s;ed with their con&s;ent, might &s;tand in|violable.&endq;</Q> They fir&s;t pre&s;ented their Petition to the Hou&s;e of Peers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A tumultuous Petition of A prentices, and others, to both Hou&s;es concerning their Militia.</NOTE> who immediately revoked their late Ordinance of <HI>July,</HI> and confirm'd their former of <HI>May;</HI> and &s;ent it down to the Commons for their con|&s;ent; who dur&s;t not deny their concurrence, the Apprentices behaving <MILESTONE N="10"> them&s;elves &s;o in&s;olently, that they would &s;carce &s;uffer the door of the Hou&s;e of Commons to be &s;hut; and &s;ome of them went into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AND in this manner the Ordinance was rever&s;ed that had been made at the de&s;ire of the Army, and the other of <HI>May</HI> ratified and confirm'd; which was no &s;ooner done than the Parliament adjourn'd till <HI>Friday,</HI> that they might have two or three days to con&s;ider how they &s;hould behave them&s;elves, and prevent the like violences hereafter. The Ar|my had quickly notice of the&s;e extraordinary proceedings, and the Ge|neral writ a very &s;harp Letter to the Parliament from <HI>Bedford;</HI> in which he put them in mind, <Q>&startq;how civilly the Army had complied with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon this the General writ a very &s;harp Letter to the Parliament.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> their de&s;ire, by removing to a greater di&s;tance, upon pre&s;umption that their own Authority would have been able to have &s;ecured them from any rudene&s;s, and violence of the People; which it was now evi|dent it could not do, by the unparallel'd violation of all their Privi|leges, on the <HI>Monday</HI> before, by a Multitude from the City, which had been encouraged by &s;everal Common Council Men, and other Citizens in Authority; which was an Act &s;o prodigious and horrid as mu&s;t di&s;&s;olve all Government, if not &s;everely and exemplarily cha&s;ti&s;ed: that the Army looked upon them&s;elves as accountable to the King|dom, if this unheard of outrage, by which the Peace and &s;ettlement <MILESTONE N="30"> of the Nation, and the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> had been &s;o notoriou&s;ly in|terrupted, &s;hould not be &s;trictly examined, and ju&s;tice &s;peedily done&endq; upon the Offenders.</Q> Upon <HI>Friday,</HI> to which both Hou&s;es had adjourn'd, the Members came together, in as full Numbers as they had u&s;ed to meet, there being above one hundred and forty of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; but, after they had &s;ate &s;ometime in expectation of their Speaker, they were inform'd that he was gone out of the Town early that morn|ing; and they ob&s;erv'd that S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and &s;ome few other Mem|bers <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Speakers, with other Mem|bers of the two Hou&s;es, withdrew to the Army</NOTE> who u&s;ed to concur with him, were likewi&s;e ab&s;ent.

Hereupon both Hou&s;es cho&s;e new Speakers; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Hou&s;es cho&s;e new Speakers; and their Votes.</NOTE> who accepted the Office; and the Commons pre&s;ently voted, <Q>&startq;that the eleven Members who &s;tood impeach'd by the Army, and had di&s;con|tinued coming to the Hou&s;e, &s;hould pre&s;ently appear, and take their&endq; places.</Q> They made an Ordinance of Parliament, by which a Com|mittee of &s;afety was appointed to joyn with the City Militia, and had Authority to rai&s;e Men for the defence of the Parliament; which they <MILESTONE N="50"> appear'd &s;o vigorou&s;ly re&s;olv'd on, that no Man in the Hou&s;es, or in the City, &s;eem'd to intend any thing el&s;e.

<HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and marched him&s;elf to <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> and appointed a general Rendezvous for the whole Army upon <HI>Houn&s;low</HI> Heath, within two days; when and where there appear'd twenty thou&s;and Foot and Hor&s;e, with a Train of Artillery, and all other provi&s;ions proportionable to &s;uch an Army.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the Rendezvous was appointed at <HI>Houn&s;low</HI> Heath, at <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rendezvous of the Army ap|pointed on</HI> Houn&s;low <HI>Heath, and the King re|moved to</HI> Hampton <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> the &s;ame time the King removed to <HI>Hampron</HI> Court; which was pre|pared, and put into as good order for his reception, as could have been done in the be&s;t time. The Hou&s;es &s;eem'd for &s;ome time to retain their Spirit and Vigour, and the City talked of li&s;ting Men, and defending <MILESTONE N="10"> them&s;elves, and not &s;uffering the Army to approach nearer to them; but, when they knew the day of the Rendezvous, tho&s;e in both Hou&s;es who had been too weak to carry any thing, and &s;o had look'd on whil&s;t &s;uch Votes were pa&s;&s;ed as they liked not and could not oppo&s;e, now when their Friend the Army was &s;o near, recover'd their Spirits, and talked very loud; and per&s;waded the re&s;t, <Q>&startq;to think in time of making&endq; their peace with the Army, that could not be with&s;tood.</Q> And the City grew every day more appalled, irre&s;olute, and confounded, one Man propo&s;ing this, and another &s;omewhat contrary to that, like Men amazed and di&s;tracted. When the Army met upon <HI>Houn&s;low</HI> Heath at <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Both Speakers, and the other Members, ap|pear in the Army on</HI> Houn&s;low <HI>Heath.</HI></NOTE> their Rendezvous, the Speakers of both Hou&s;es, who had privately be|fore met with the Chief Officers of the Army, appear'd there with their Maces, and &s;uch other Members as accompanied them; complaining to the General, <Q>&startq;that they had not freedom at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> but were&endq; in danger of their lives by the Tumults;</Q> and appealed to the Army for their protection.</P>
<P>THIS looked like a new Act of Providence to vindicate the Army from all reproaches, and to ju&s;tify them in all they had done, as ab&s;o|lutely done for the pre&s;ervation of the Parliament and Kingdom. If this had been a retreat of S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> and &s;ome other di&s;contented <MILESTONE N="30"> Men, who were known to be Independents, and Fanaticks in their opi|nions in Religion, and of the Army faction, who being no longer able to oppo&s;e the wi&s;dom of the Parliament, had fled to their Friends for protection from Ju&s;tice, they would have got no reputation, nor the Army been thought the better of for their Company; but neither of the Speakers were ever look'd upon as inclined to the Army; <HI>Lenthall</HI> was generally believ'd to have no malice towards the King, and not to be without good inclinations to the Church; and the Earl of <HI>Man|che&s;ter,</HI> who was Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Peers, was known to have all the prejudice imaginable again&s;t <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and had formerly ac|cu&s;ed <MILESTONE N="40"> him of want of Duty to the Parliament; and the other hated him above all Men, and de&s;ired to have taken away his life. The Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> were the two Pillars of the Pre&s;|byterian Party; and that they two, with the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and &s;ome other of the Lords, and &s;ome of the Commons, who had ap|pear'd to di&s;approve all the proceedings of the Army, &s;hould now joyn with S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and appeal to the Army for protection, with that formality as if they had brought the whole Parliament with them, and had been entirely driven and forced away by the City, appear'd to every &s;tander by &s;o &s;tupendious a thing, that it is not to this day under&s;tood <MILESTONE N="50"> otherwi&s;e, than that they were re&s;olv'd to have their particular &s;hares in the Treaty, which they believ'd the Chief Officers of the Army to have near concluded with the King. For that they never intended to

put the whole power into the hands of the Army, nor had any kind|ne&s;s to, or confidence in the Officers thereof, was very apparent by their carriage and behaviour after, as well as before; and if they had continued together, con&s;idering how much the City was devoted to them, it is probable that the Army would not have u&s;ed any force; which might have receiv'd a fatal repul&s;e; but that &s;ome good Compro|mi&s;e might have been made by the Interpo&s;ition of the King. But this Schi&s;me carried all the Reputation and Authority to the Army, and left none in the Parliament; for though it pre&s;ently appear'd, that the Number of tho&s;e who left the Hou&s;es was &s;mall in compari&s;on of tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="10"> who remain'd behind, and who proceeded with the &s;ame Vigour in de|claring again&s;t the Army, and the City &s;eem'd as re&s;olute in putting them&s;elves into a po&s;ture, and preparing for their defence, all their works and fortifications being &s;till entire, &s;o that they might have put the Army to great trouble if they had &s;teadily pur&s;ued their Re&s;olu|tions (which they did not yet &s;eem in any degree to decline) yet this rent made all the accu&s;ed Members, who were the Men of parts, and reputation to conduct their Coun&s;els, to withdraw them&s;elves upon the a&s;toni&s;hment; &s;ome concealing them&s;elves, till they had opportunity to make their Peace, and others withdrawing and tran&s;porting them|&s;elves <MILESTONE N="20"> beyond the Seas; whereof <HI>Stapleton</HI> died at <HI>Calais</HI> a&s;&s;oon as he landed, and was denied burial, upon imagination that he had died of the Plague: others remain'd a long time beyond the Seas; and, though they long after return'd, never were receiv'd into any tru&s;t in tho&s;e times, nor in truth concurr'd, or acted in the publick Affairs, but re|tired to their own E&s;tates, and liv'd very privately.</P>
<P>THE Chief Officers of the Army receiv'd the two Speakers, and the Members who accompanied them, as &s;o many Angels &s;ent from Heaven for their Good; paid them all the re&s;pect imaginable, and pro&s;e&s;&s;ed all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to them, as to the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and declared <Q>&startq;that <MILESTONE N="30"> they would ree&s;tabli&s;h them in their full power, or peri&s;h in the at|tempt;&endq;</Q> took very particular care for their accommodations, before the General; and a&s;&s;ign'd a Guard to wait upon them for their &s;ecurity; acquainted them with all their con&s;ultations, and would not pre&s;ume to re&s;olve any thing without their approbation: and they had too much mode&s;ty to think they could do ami&s;s, who had pro&s;per'd &s;o much in all their undertakings. No time was lo&s;t in pur&s;uing their Re&s;olution to e&s;tabli&s;h the Parliament again at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> and finding that the re&s;t of the Members continued &s;till to &s;it there with the &s;ame formality, and that the City did not abate any of their Spirit, they &s;eem'd to make a <MILESTONE N="40"> halt, and to remain quiet, in expectation of a better under&s;tanding be|tween them, upon the Me&s;&s;ages they every day &s;ent to the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen, and Common Council (for of tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> they took no notice) and Quarter'd their Army about <HI>Brentford,</HI> and <HI>Houn|&s;low, Twittenham,</HI> and the adjacent Villages, without re&s;training any Provi&s;ions, which every day according to cu&s;tom were carried to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> or doing the lea&s;t Action that might di&s;oblige, or di&s;plea&s;e the City; the Army being in truth under &s;o excellent di&s;cipline, that no body could complain of any damage &s;u&s;tain'd by them, or any provo|cation by word or deed. However, in this calm, they &s;ent over Colonel <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Rainsborough</HI> with a Brigade of Hor&s;e and Foot, and Cannon, at <HI>Ham|pton</HI> Court, to po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Southwark,</HI> and tho&s;e works which &s;ecured that end of <HI>London</HI> Bridge; which he did with &s;o little Noi&s;e, that in one

<P>THIS &s;truck them dead; and put an end to all their Con&s;ultation for <MILESTONE N="10"> defence; and put other thoughts into their heads, how they might pa|cify tho&s;e whom they had &s;o much offended, and provoked; and how they might pre&s;erve their City from Plunder, and the fury of an en|raged Army. They who had ever been of the Army party, and of late had &s;hut them&s;elves up, and not dared to walk the Streets for fear of the People, came now confidently among&s;t them, and mingled in their Councils; declared, <Q>&startq;that the King and the Army were now agreed in all particulars, and that both Hou&s;es were now with the Army, and had pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the King; &s;o that to oppo&s;e the Army would be to oppo&s;e the King and Parliament, and to incen&s;e them as&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> much as the Army.</Q> Upon &s;uch confident di&s;cour&s;es and in&s;inuations from tho&s;e with whom they would not have conver&s;ed, or given the lea&s;t credit to, three days before, or rather upon the confu&s;ion and ge|neral di&s;traction they were in, they &s;ent &s;ix Aldermen and &s;ix Com|moners <NOTE PLACE="marg">The City &s;ends &s;ix Aldermen to the General, and &s;ubmits.</NOTE> to the General; who lamented, and complain'd, <Q>&startq;that the City &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, that had never acted any thing again&s;t the Par|liament; and therefore, they de&s;ired him to forbear doing any thing&endq; that might be the occa&s;ion of a new War.</Q> But the General little con|&s;ider'd this Me&s;&s;age, and gave le&s;s countenance to the Me&s;&s;engers; but continued his &s;low marches towards the City: whereupon they &s;ent an <MILESTONE N="30"> humble Me&s;&s;age to him, <Q>&startq;that &s;ince they under&s;tood that the rea&s;on of his march &s;o near <HI>London</HI> was to re&s;tore, and &s;ettle the Members (the Lords and Commons) of Parliament to the Liberty and Privilege of &s;itting &s;ecurely in their &s;everal Hou&s;es (to which the City would contribute all their power, and &s;ervice) they prayed him, with all &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;end &s;uch a Guard of Hor&s;e and Foot as he thought to be &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e; and that the Ports and all Pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould be open to them; and they &s;hould do any&endq; thing el&s;e that his Excellency would Command.</Q> To which, he made no other An&s;wer but <Q>&startq;that he would have all the Forts of the We&s;t <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ide of the City to be deliver'd immediately to him; tho&s;e of the other &s;ide being already, as is &s;aid, in the hands of <HI>Rainsborough</HI> and his&endq; other Officers.</Q> The Common Council, that &s;ate day and night, upon the receipt of this Me&s;&s;age, without any pau&s;e return'd <Q>&startq;that they would humbly &s;ubmit to his Command; and that now, under Al|mighty God, they did rely only upon his Excellencies honourable word&endq; for their protection, and &s;ecurity.</Q> And &s;o they cau&s;ed their Militia to be forthwith drawn off from the Line, as well as out of the Forts, with all their Cannon and Ordnance; and the General appointed a bet|ter Guard to both. At <HI>Hyde</HI> Park the Mayor and Aldermen met him, <MILESTONE N="50"> and humbly congratulated his arrival; and be&s;ought him <Q>&startq;to excu&s;e what they had, out of their good meaning and de&s;ire of Peace, done&endq; ami&s;s;</Q> and as a Te&s;timony of their Affection and Duty, the Mayor,

The fir&s;t thing they did, was calling in the General into both Hou&s;es, and making him a large acknowledgement in the name of each <MILESTONE N="10"> Hou&s;e, of the great favours he had done to them: they thanked him for the Protection he had given to their Per&s;ons, and his Vindication of the Privileges of Parliament. <Q>Then they voted &startq;all that had been done by them&s;elves in going to the Army, and in re&s;iding there, and&endq; all that had been done by the Army, to be well and lawfully done;</Q> as, &s;ome time after, they al&s;o voted, <Q>&startq;that all that had been done in the Hou&s;es &s;ince their departure, was again&s;t Law, and Privilege of&endq; Parliament, invalid and void: Then they adjourn'd to the next day, without que&s;tioning or puni&s;hing any Member who had acted there.</Q></P>
<P>THE Army of Hor&s;e, Foot, and Cannon, marched the next day <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army marches thro' the City, and Quarters about it.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> through the City (which, upon the de&s;ire of the Parliament, undertook forthwith to &s;upply an hundred thou&s;and pounds for the payment of the Army) without the lea&s;t di&s;order, or doing the lea&s;t damage to any Per&s;on, or giving any di&s;re&s;pective word to any Man; by which they attained the reputation of being in excellent Di&s;cipline, and that both Officers and Soldiers were Men of extraordinary temper and &s;obriety. So they marched over <HI>London</HI> Bridge into <HI>Southwark,</HI> and to tho&s;e Quarters to which they were a&s;&s;ign'd; &s;ome Regiments were Quarter'd in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Strand,</HI> and <HI>Holborn,</HI> under pretence of being a Guard to the Parliament, but intended as a Guard upon the City.

<P>WHILST the&s;e things were thus agitated between the Army, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King at</HI> Hampton <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> the Parliament, and the City, the King enjoyed him&s;elf at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, much more to his content than he had of late; the re&s;pects of the Chief Officers of the Army &s;eeming much greater than they had <MILESTONE N="40"> been; <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf came oftner to him, and had longer conferences with him; talked with more openne&s;s to M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> than he had done, and appear'd more chearful.

<P>THE Prince&s;s <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was not above a year or two younger than the Duke, a Lady of excellent parts, great ob&s;ervation, and an early under&s;tanding; which the King di&s;cern'd, by the Account &s;he gave him both of Things and Per&s;ons, upon the experience &s;he had had of both. <Q>His Maje&s;ty enjoyn'd her, &startq;upon the wor&s;t that could befal him, never to be di&s;po&s;ed of in Marriage without the con&s;ent and approbation of the Queen her Mother, and the Prince her Brother; and allways to perform all Duty and Obedience to both tho&s;e; and to obey the Queen in all things, except in matter of Religion; in which he commanded her, upon his Ble&s;&s;ing, never to hearken or con&s;ent to her; but to continue firm in the Religion &s;he had been in&s;tructed and educated in, <MILESTONE N="40"> what di&s;countenance and ruin &s;oever might befal the poor Church, at&endq; that time under &s;o &s;evere pro&s;ecution.</Q></P>

And many years after, when he was &s;ent out of <HI>England,</HI> he made the full relation of all the particulars to Me, with that commotion of Spirit, that it appear'd to be deeply <MILESTONE N="20"> rooted in him; and made u&s;e of one part of it very &s;ea&s;onably after|wards, where there was more than an ordinary attempt made to have perverted him in his Religion, and to per&s;wade him to become Roman Catholick for the advancement of his Fortune.</P>
<P>IN this manner, and with the&s;e kind of reflections, the King made u&s;e of the Liberty he enjoyed; and con&s;ider'd as well, what remedies to apply to the wor&s;t that could fall out, as to care&s;s the Officers of the Army in order to the improvement of his condition; of which he was not yet in de&s;pair; the Chief Officers, and all the heads of that Party, looking upon it as their wi&s;e&s;t Policy to cheri&s;h the King's hopes by the <MILESTONE N="30"> liberty they gave him, and by a very flowing courte&s;y towards all who had been of his Party; who&s;e expectation, and good word, and te&s;ti|mony, they found did them much good both in the City and the Country.</P>
<P>AT this time the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> whom We left in <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> hearing of the difference between the Parliament and the Army, left his two Friends there; and made a Journey to <HI>Paris</HI> to the Prince, that he might re|ceive his Highne&s;s's approbation of his going for <HI>England;</HI> which he very willingly gave; well knowing that he would improve all opportu|nities, with great diligence, for the King his Father's Service: and then <MILESTONE N="40"> that Lord tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>Zealand,</HI> his Friends having advi&s;ed him to be in tho&s;e parts before they endeavour'd to procure a Pa&s;s for him; which they ea&s;ily did, a&s;&s;oon as he came thither; and &s;o he had liberty to remain at his own Hou&s;e in the Country, where he was ex|ceedingly belov'd, and hated no where. And in this general and illi|mited <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Ca|pel <HI>waits on the King at</HI> Hampton <HI>Court from</HI> Jer&s;y.</NOTE> indulgence, he took the opportunity to wait upon the King at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court; and gave him a particular Account of all that pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> before the Prince's remove from thence, and of the rea&s;ons which induced tho&s;e of the Council to remain &s;till there, and of many other particulars, of which his Maje&s;ty had never before been through|ly <MILESTONE N="50"> inform'd, and which put it out of any Bodies power to do the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer any ill offices: and from thence the King writ, with his own hand, a very gracious and kind Letter to the Chancellor

at <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> full of hope <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould conclude &s;uch a Treaty with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sub&s;tance of the King's Letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE> Army and Parliament that he &s;hould &s;hortly draw Him, and &s;ome&endq; other of his Friends, to him.</Q> He thanked him <Q>&startq;for undertaking the work he was upon; and told him, he &s;hould expect &s;peedily to receive&endq; &s;ome contribution from him towards it;</Q> and, within a very &s;hort time afterwards, he &s;ent to him his own Memorials (or tho&s;e which by his command had been kept, and were peru&s;ed, and corrected by him|&s;elf) of all that had pa&s;&s;ed from the time he had left his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> when he waited upon the Prince into the We&s;t, to the very day that the King left <HI>Oxford</HI> to go to the <HI>Scots;</HI> out of which Memorials, <MILESTONE N="10"> as hath been &s;aid before, the mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;ages in the years 1644, and 1645, are faithfully collected. To the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> his Maje&s;ty im|parted all his hopes and all his fears; and what great Overtures the <HI>Scots</HI> had again made to him; and <Q>&startq;that he did really believe that it could not be long before there would be a War between the two Nations; in which the <HI>Scots</HI> promi&s;ed them&s;elves an univer&s;al concurrence from all the Presbyterians in <HI>England;</HI> and that, in &s;uch a conjuncture, he wi&s;hed that his own Party would put them&s;elves in Armes, without&endq; which he could not expect great benefit by the &s;ucce&s;s of the other:</Q> and therefore de&s;ired <HI>Capel</HI> <Q>&startq;to watch &s;uch a conjuncture, and draw his&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> Friends together;</Q> which he promi&s;ed to do effectually; and did, very punctually, afterwards, to the lo&s;s of his own Life. Then the King en|joyn'd him <Q>&startq;to write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that when|ever the Queen, or Prince, &s;hould require him to come to them, he&endq; &s;hould not fail to yield obedience to their Command;</Q> and him&s;elf writ to the Queen, <Q>&startq;that whenever the Sea&s;on &s;hould be ripe for the Prince to engage him&s;elf in any Action, &s;he &s;hould not fail to &s;end&endq; for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to wait upon him in it.</Q> And ma|ny things were then adju&s;ted, upon the fore&s;ight of future contingencies, which were afterwards thought fit to be executed. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had, by &s;pecial Command and Order from the King whil&s;t he was with the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> deliver'd up the City of <HI>Dublin</HI> to the Parliament, after the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had &s;o infamou&s;ly broken the Peace they had made with the King, and brought their whole Army before <HI>Dublin</HI> to Be&s;iege it; by which he was reduced to tho&s;e &s;treights that he had no other election than to deliver it to the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> or to the Parliament; of which his Maje&s;ty being inform'd, determin'd, he &s;hould give it to the Parliament; which he did, with full conditions for all tho&s;e who had &s;erv'd his Maje&s;ty; and &s;o tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>England,</HI> and, from <HI>London,</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the King at <HI>Hampton</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>likewi&s;e waits on the King at</HI> Hampton <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> Court; who receiv'd him with extraordinary Grace, as a Per&s;on who had &s;erv'd him with great Zeal and Fidelity, and with the mo&s;t univer&s;al Te&s;timony of all good Men that any Man could receive. He u&s;ed le&s;s Application to the Parliament and Army than other Men, relying upon the Articles the Parliament had &s;ign'd to him; by which he had liberty to &s;tay &s;o many Months in <HI>England,</HI> and at the end thereof to tran&s;port him&s;elf into the parts beyond the Seas, if in the mean time he made no compo&s;ition with the Parliament: which he never intended to do; and though he knew well that there were many jealous Eyes upon him, he repaired frequently to pre&s;ent his Duty to the King; who was exceed|ingly <MILESTONE N="50"> plea&s;ed to con&s;er with him, and to find that he was re&s;olv'd to undertake any enterpri&s;e that might advance his Service; which the King him&s;elf, and mo&s;t other Men who wi&s;hed well to it, did at that

time believe to be in no de&s;perate condition. And no Men were fuller <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Scoti&s;h <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners.</HI></NOTE> of profe&s;&s;ions of Duty, and a re&s;olution to run all hazards, than the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners; who, from the time they had deliver'd up the King, re&s;ided at <HI>London</HI> with their u&s;ual confidence, and loudly com|plain'd of the pre&s;umption of the Army in &s;ei&s;ing upon the Per&s;on of the King; in&s;inuated them&s;elves to all tho&s;e who were thought to be mo&s;t con&s;tant, and in&s;eparable from the Intere&s;t of the Crown, with pa&s;&s;io|nate undertaking that their whole Nation would be united, to a Man, in any Enterpri&s;e for his Service. And now, from the time his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, they came to him with as much pre&s;umption <MILESTONE N="10"> as if they had carried him to <HI>Edenborough;</HI> which was the more noto|rious, and was thought to &s;ignify the more, becau&s;e their Per&s;ons were known to be mo&s;t odious to all the great Officers in the Army, and to tho&s;e who now govern'd in the Parliament. Here the foundation of that engagement was laid, which was endeavour'd to be perform'd the next year en&s;uing, and which the <HI>Scots</HI> them&s;elves then communicated to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> and other tru&s;ty Per&s;ons; as if there was nothing el&s;e intended in it than a full vindication of all his Maje&s;ties Rights and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN the Army had thus &s;ubdued all oppo&s;ition, and the Parlia|ment <MILESTONE N="20"> and They &s;eem'd all of a piece, and the refractory humours of the City &s;eem'd to be &s;uppre&s;s'd, and totally tamed, the Army &s;eem'd le&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army be|gins to be le&s;s regardful of the King</NOTE> regardful of the King than they had been; the chief Officers came rarely to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, nor had they the &s;ame countenances towards <HI>A&s;h|burnham,</HI> and <HI>Berkley,</HI> as they u&s;ed to have; they were not at lei&s;ure to &s;peak with them, and when they did, asked captious Que&s;tions, and gave An&s;wers them&s;elves of no &s;ignification. The Agitators, and Coun|cil of Officers, &s;ent &s;ome Propo&s;itions to the King, as ruinous to the Church and de&s;tructive to the Regal Power, as had been yet made by the Parliament; and in &s;ome re&s;pects, much wor&s;e, and more di&s;ho|nourable; <MILESTONE N="30"> and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;if his Maje&s;ty would con&s;ent thereunto, they would apply them&s;elves to the Parliament, and do the be&s;t they could to&endq; per&s;wade them to be of the &s;ame opinion.</Q> But his Maje&s;ty rejected them with more than u&s;ual indignation, not without &s;ome reproaches upon the Officers, for having deluded him, and having prevailed in all their own de&s;igns, by making the world believe that they intended his Maje&s;ties Re&s;toration and Settlement, upon better conditions than the Parliament was willing to admit. By this manner of re&s;entment, the Army took it &s;elf to be di&s;obliged, and u&s;ed another language in their di&s;cour&s;e of the King than they had, for &s;ome Months, done; and &s;uch <MILESTONE N="40"> Officers who had formerly &s;erv'd the King, and had been civilly treated and &s;helter'd in the Quarters of the Army, were now driven from thence. They who had been kind to them, withdrew them&s;elves from their ac|quaintance; and the Seque&s;trations of all the E&s;tates of the Cavaliers, which had been intermitted, were revived with as much rigour as ever had been before practiced, and the declared Delinquents racked to as high compo&s;itions; which if they refu&s;ed to make, their whole E&s;tates were taken from them, and their Per&s;ons expo&s;ed to affronts, and in&s;e|curity; but this was imputed to the prevalence of the Presbyterian hu|mour in the Parliament again&s;t the judgement of the Army: and it is <MILESTONE N="50"> very true, that though the Parliament was &s;o far &s;ubdued, that it no more found fault with what the Army did, nor complain'd that it meddled in determining what &s;ettlement &s;hould be made in the Govern|ment,
<PB N="56" REF="780">
yet, in all their own Acts and Proceedings, they pro&s;ecuted a Presbyterian Settlement as earne&s;tly as they could. The Covenant was pre&s;&s;ed in all places, and the Anabapti&s;ts and other Sects, which begun to abound, were puni&s;hed, re&s;trained, and di&s;countenanced; which the Army liked not, as a violation of the Liberty of tender Con&s;ciences; which, they pretended, was as much the Original of the Quarrel, as any other Grievance what&s;oever.</P>
<P>IN this year, 1647, they had begun a Vi&s;itation of the Univer&s;ity of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Univer&s;ity of</HI> Oxford <HI>vi|&s;ited by the Parliament.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Oxford;</HI> which they fini&s;hed not till the next year; in which the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> had been contented to be imployed as Chancellor of the <MILESTONE N="10"> Univer&s;ity, who had taken an Oath to defend the Rights and Privileges of the Univer&s;ity; notwith&s;tanding which, out of the extreme weak|ne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, and the mi&s;erable complyance of his Nature, he &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be made a Property in joyning with <HI>Brent, Pryn,</HI> and &s;ome Committee Men, and Presbyterian Mini&s;ters, as Commi&s;|&s;ioners for the Parliament to reform the Di&s;cipline, and erroneous Doctrine of that famous Univer&s;ity, by the Rule of the Covenant; which was the Standard of all Mens learning, and ability to govern; all Per&s;ons of what Quality &s;oever being required to &s;ub&s;cribe that Te&s;t; which the whole Body of the Univer&s;ity was &s;o far from &s;ubmitting to, <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Oxford <HI>Rea&s;ons a|gain&s;t the Co|venant pa&s;s'd in Convoca|tion this time.</HI></NOTE> that they met in their Convocation, and, to their eternal renown (be|ing at the &s;ame time under a &s;trict and &s;trong Garri&s;on, put over them by the Parliament; the King in Pri&s;on; and all their hopes de&s;perate) pa&s;&s;ed a publick Act, and Declaration again&s;t the Covenant, with &s;uch invincible Arguments of the Illegality, Wickedne&s;s, and Perjury con|tained in it, that no Man of the contrary opinion, nor the A&s;&s;embly of the Divines (which then &s;ate at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> forming a new Cate|chi&s;m, and Scheme of Religion) ever ventur'd to make any An&s;wer to it; nor is it indeed to be an&s;wer'd, but mu&s;t remain, to the World's end, as a monument of the Learning, Courage, and Loyalty, of that excel|lent <MILESTONE N="30"> place, again&s;t the highe&s;t Malice and Tyranny that was ever exer|ci&s;ed in, or over any Nation; and which tho&s;e famous Commi&s;&s;ioners only an&s;wer'd by expelling all tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to their ju|ri&s;diction, or to take the Covenant; which was, upon the matter, the whole Univer&s;ity; &s;carce one Governour and Ma&s;ter of College or Hall, and an incredible &s;mall Number of the Fellows, or Scholars, &s;ubmitting to either; whereupon that de&s;olation being made, they placed in their rooms, the mo&s;t notorious factious Presbyterians, in the Government of the &s;everal Colleges or Halls; and &s;uch other of the &s;ame leven in the Fellow&s;hips, and Scholars places, of tho&s;e whom they had expelled, <MILESTONE N="40"> without any regard to the Statutes of the &s;everal Founders, and the Incapacities of the Per&s;ons that were put in. The Omnipotence of an Ordinance of Parliament, confirm'd all that was this way done; and there was no farther contending again&s;t it.</P>
<P>IT might rea&s;onably be concluded that this wild and barbarous de|population, would even extirpate all that Learning, Religion, and Loyalty, which had &s;o eminently flouri&s;hed there; and that the &s;uc|ceeding ill Husbandry, and unskilful cultivation, would have made it fruitful only in Ignorance, Prophanation, Athei&s;m, and Rebellion; but, by God's wonderful ble&s;&s;ing, the goodne&s;s and richne&s;s of that Soil could <MILESTONE N="50"> not be made barren by all that &s;tupidity and negligence.

mutually &s;ucceeding each other, and with the &s;ame malice and perver&s;ne&s;s endeavouring to extingui&s;h all good Literature and Al|legiance, it yielded a Harve&s;t of extraordinary good and &s;ound know|ledge in all parts of Learning; and many who were wickedly introduced, applied them&s;elves to the Study of good Learning, and the practice of Virtue; and had inclination to that duty and obedience they had never been taught; &s;o that when it plea&s;ed God to bring King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd back to his Throne, he found that Univer&s;ity (not to undervalue the other, which had nobly likewi&s;e rejected the ill infu&s;ions which had been indu&s;triou&s;ly poured into it) abounding in excellent Learning, and <MILESTONE N="10"> devoted to Duty and Obedience, little inferior to what it was before its de&s;olation; which was a lively in&s;tance of God's mercy, and purpo&s;e, for ever &s;o to provide for his Church, that the Gates of Hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t it; which were never open'd wider, nor with more Ma|lice, than in that time.</P>
<P>THESE violent Proceedings in all places, bla&s;ted all the King's hopes, and put an end to all the re&s;t and quiet he had for &s;ome time enjoyed; nor could he devi&s;e any remedy. He was weary of depending upon the Army, but neither knew how to get from them, nor whither el&s;e to re&s;ort for help. The Officers of tho&s;e Guards which were a&s;&s;ign'd to <MILESTONE N="20"> attend his Per&s;on, and who had behaved them&s;elves with good Man|ners, and Duty towards him, and very civilly towards tho&s;e of his Party who had u&s;ed to wait upon his Maje&s;ty, begun now to murmur at &s;o great re&s;ort to him, and to u&s;e many, who came, rudely; and not to &s;uffer them to go into the room where the King was; or, which was wor&s;e, put them out when they were there; and when his Maje&s;ty &s;eem'd to take notice and be troubled at it, they appear'd not to be con|cern'd, nor an&s;wer'd him with that Duty they had u&s;ed to do. They affronted the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners very notably, and would not &s;uffer them to &s;peak with the King; which cau&s;ed an expo&s;tulation from the <MILESTONE N="30"> Parliament; which removed the ob&s;truction for the future, but pro|cured no &s;atisfaction for the injury they had receiv'd, nor made the &s;ame Officers more civil towards their Per&s;ons. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> and <HI>Berkley,</HI> receiv'd many adverti&s;ements from &s;ome Officers with whom they had mo&s;t conver&s;ed, and who would have been glad that the King might have been re&s;tored by the Army for the preferments which they expected might fall to their &s;hare, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> re&s;olv'd never to&endq; tru&s;t the King, or to do any thing towards his Re&s;toration;</Q> and they two &s;teer'd the whole Body; and therefore it was advi&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that &s;ome&endq; way might be found to remove his Maje&s;ty out of their hands.</Q> Major <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Huntington,</HI> one of the be&s;t Officers they had, and Major to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s own Regiment of Hor&s;e, upon whom he relyed in any Enterpri&s;e of importance more than upon any Man, had been imployed by him to the King, to &s;ay tho&s;e things from him which had given the King the mo&s;t confidence, and was much more than he had ever &s;aid to <HI>A&s;hburn|ham;</HI> and the Major did really believe that he had meant all he &s;aid, and the King had a good opinion of the Integrity of the Major, upon the Te&s;timony he had receiv'd from &s;ome he knew had no mind to de|ceive his Maje&s;ty; and the Man merited the Te&s;timony they gave him.

<P>THERE was at this time a new Faction grown up in the Army, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Levellers grew up in the Army.</NOTE> which were either by their own denomination, or with their own con|&s;ent, called <HI>Levellers;</HI> who &s;poke in&s;olently and confidently again&s;t the King and Parliament, and the great Officers of the Army; and pro|fe&s;&s;ed as great malice again&s;t all the Lords, as again&s;t the King; and de|clared <MILESTONE N="20"> <Q>&startq;that all degrees of Men &s;hould be levelled, and an equality &s;hould&endq; be e&s;tabli&s;hed, both in Titles and E&s;tates, throughout the Kingdoms.</Q> Whether the rai&s;ing this Spirit was a piece of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s ordinary witch|craft, in order to &s;ome of his de&s;igns, or whether it grew among&s;t tho&s;e Tares which had been &s;owed in that confu&s;ion, certain it is, it gave him real trouble at la&s;t (which mu&s;t be &s;et down hereafter) but the pre&s;ent u&s;e he made of it, was, that, upon the licentious di&s;cour&s;e of that kind, which &s;ome Soldiers upon the Guard u&s;ually made, the Guard upon the King's Per&s;on was doubled; a re&s;traint put upon the great re&s;ort of People who came to &s;ee the King; and all pretended to be for his &s;ecu|rity, <MILESTONE N="30"> and to prevent any violence that might be attempted upon his life; which they &s;eem'd to apprehend, and dete&s;t. In the mean time, they neither hinder'd his Maje&s;ty from riding abroad to take the Air, nor from doing any thing he had a mind to, nor re&s;train'd tho&s;e who waited upon him in his Bed-Chamber, nor his Chaplains from performing their functions; though towards all the&s;e there was le&s;s civility exerci&s;ed than had been; and the Guards which waited neare&s;t, were more rude, and made more noi&s;e at un&s;ea&s;onable hours than they had been accu&s;tom'd to do; the Captain who commanded them, Colonel <HI>Whaley,</HI> being a Man of a rough and brutal temper, who had offer'd great violence to <MILESTONE N="40"> his Nature, when he appear'd to exerci&s;e any civility and good manners. The King, every day, receiv'd little Billets, or Letters, &s;ecretly con|veyed to him without any Name, which adverti&s;ed him of wicked de|&s;igns upon his life, and &s;ome of them advi&s;ed him to make an E&s;cape, and repair &s;ecretly into the City, where he &s;hould be &s;afe; &s;ome Let|ters directing him to &s;uch an Alderman's Hou&s;e; all which his Maje&s;ty looked upon as artifice to lead him into &s;ome &s;treights, from whence he &s;hould not ea&s;ily explicate him&s;elf; and yet many who repaired to him, brought the &s;ame advice from Men of unque&s;tionable &s;incerity, by what rea&s;on &s;oever they were &s;wayed. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE King found him&s;elf in great perplexity, from what he di&s;cern'd, and ob&s;erv'd him&s;elf, as well as what he heard from others; but what u&s;e to make of the one or the other, was very hard to re&s;olve: he did

really believe that their Malice was at the height, and that they did de|&s;ign his Murther, but knew not which was a probable way to prevent it. The making an e&s;cape, if it were not contrived with wonderful &s;a|gacity, would expo&s;e him to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, by pretended Ignorance, and would be charged upon him&s;elf; and if he could avoid their Guards, and get beyond them undi&s;cover'd, whither &s;hould he go? and what place would receive and defend him? The hope of the City &s;eem'd not to him to have a foundation of rea&s;on; they had been too late &s;ubdued to recover Courage for &s;uch an adventure; and the Army now was much more Ma&s;ter of it than when they de&s;ponded. There is rea&s;on to <MILESTONE N="10"> believe that he did re&s;olve to tran&s;port him&s;elf beyond the Seas, which had been no hard matter to have brought to pa&s;s, but with whom he con&s;ulted for the way of doing it, is not to this day di&s;cover'd; they who were in&s;trumental in his remove, pretending to know nothing of the re&s;olution, or coun&s;el. But, one morning, being the eleventh of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King e&s;capes from</HI> Hampton <HI>Court</HI> No. 11.</NOTE> <HI>November,</HI> the King having, the night before, pretended &s;ome indi&s;po|&s;ition, and that he would go to his re&s;t, they who went into his Cham|ber, found that he was not there, nor had been in his Bed that night. There were two or three Letters found upon his Table, writ all with his own hand, one to the Parliament, another to the General; in which <MILESTONE N="20"> he declared <Q>&startq;the rea&s;on of his remove to be, an apprehen&s;ion that &s;ome de&s;perate Per&s;ons had a de&s;ign to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him; and therefore he had withdrawn him&s;elf with a purpo&s;e of remaining concealed, until the Parliament had agreed upon &s;uch Propo&s;itions as &s;hould be fit for him to con&s;ent to; and he would then appear, and willingly con&s;ent to any thing that &s;hould be for the Peace and Happine&s;s of the King|dom.&endq;</Q> There were di&s;cover'd the treading of Hor&s;es at a Back door of the Garden into which his Maje&s;ty had a Pa&s;&s;age out of his Chamber, and it is true that way he went, having appointed his Hor&s;e to be there ready at an hour, and S^r <HI>John Berkley, A&s;hburnham,</HI> and <HI>Legg,</HI> to wait <MILESTONE N="30"> upon him, the two la&s;t being of his Bed-Chamber. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> alone &s;eem'd to know what they were to do, the other two having receiv'd only Orders to attend. When they were free from the Apprehen&s;ion of the Guards, and the Hor&s;e Quarters, they rode towards the South We&s;t, and towards that part of <HI>Ham&s;hire</HI> which led to the New Fore&s;t. The King asked <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> where the Ship lay? which made the other two conclude that the King re&s;olv'd to tran&s;port him&s;elf. After they had made &s;ome &s;tay in that part next the Sea, and <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> had been &s;ome time ab&s;ent, he return'd without any news of the Ship; with which the King &s;eem'd troubled. Upon this di&s;appointment, the King <MILESTONE N="40"> thought it be&s;t, for avoiding all high-ways, to go to <HI>Tichfield,</HI> a noble <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He comes to</HI> Tichfield <HI>in</HI> Ham&s;hire.</NOTE> Seat of the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI>'s (who was not there) but inhabited by the old Lady his Mother with a &s;mall Family, which made the re|treat the more convenient; there his Maje&s;ty alighted, and would &s;peak with the Lady; to whom he made no &s;cruple of communicating him|&s;elf, well knowing her to be a Lady of that Honour, and Spirit, that &s;he was &s;uperior to all kind of temptation. There he refre&s;hed him&s;elf, and con&s;ulted with his three Servants, what he &s;hould next do, &s;ince there was neither Ship ready, nor could they pre&s;ume that they could remain long there undi&s;cover'd. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>IN this debate, the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> came to be mention'd (as they &s;ay) by <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> as a place where his Maje&s;ty might &s;ecurely repo&s;e him&s;elf, until he thought fit to inform the Parliament where he was.

<P>AFTER &s;ome time &s;pent in debate, in which he made many expre&s;|&s;ions of his de&s;ire to do any Service to his Maje&s;ty, they were contented that he &s;hould go with them; and <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he would con|duct&endq; him to the place where the King was;</Q> and &s;o, he commanding <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They bring</HI> Hammond <HI>to the King.</HI></NOTE> three or four Servants or Soldiers to wait on him, they went together to <HI>Tichfield;</HI> and, the other &s;taying below, <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> went up to the King's Chamber.

<P>IT never appear'd afterwards that the King was malitiou&s;ly betrayed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's opinion of this whole bu&s;ine&s;s.</NOTE> to this unhappy peregrination, by the treachery and practice of tho&s;e he tru&s;ted; and his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf never entertain'd the lea&s;t jealou&s;y, or &s;u&s;picion of it; yet the whole de&s;ign appear'd to be &s;o weakly con|trived, the not being &s;ure of a Ship, if the re&s;olution were fixed for em|barking, which was never manife&s;t, the making choice of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> and of <HI>Hammond</HI> to be tru&s;ted, &s;ince nothing fell out which was <MILESTONE N="10"> not to be rea&s;onably fore&s;een and expected, and the bringing him to <HI>Tichfield,</HI> without the permi&s;&s;ion of the King, if not directly contrary to it, &s;eem'd to be all &s;o far from a rational de&s;ign and conduct, that mo&s;t Men did believe there was Trea&s;on in the contrivance, or that his Maje&s;ty entru&s;ted tho&s;e who were gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon and deceiv'd by his greate&s;t Enemies. <HI>Legg</HI> had had &s;o general a reputation of In|tegrity, and Fidelity to his Ma&s;ter, that he never fell under the lea&s;t imputation or reproach with any Man: he was a very punctual and &s;teady ob&s;erver of the Orders he receiv'd, but no contriver of them, and though he had in truth a better judgement and under&s;tanding than <MILESTONE N="20"> either of the other two, his mode&s;ty and diffidence of him&s;elf never &s;uf|fer'd him to contrive bold Coun&s;els. <HI>Berkley</HI> was le&s;s known among tho&s;e Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality who had follow'd the King, being in a very private Station before the War, and his Po&s;t in it being in the farthe&s;t Corner of the Kingdom, and not much &s;poken of till the end of it, when he was not beholden to reports; Ambition and Vanity were well known to be predominant in him, and that he had great confidence in him&s;elf, and did not delight to conver&s;e with tho&s;e who had not; but he never fell under any blemi&s;h of di&s;loyalty, and he took care to pub|li&s;h that this Enterpri&s;e of the King's was &s;o totally without his privity, <MILESTONE N="30"> that he was required to attend on Hor&s;e-back at &s;uch an hour, and had not the lea&s;t intimation of his Maje&s;ties purpo&s;e what he intended to do. Another particular, which was acknowledged by <HI>Hammond,</HI> did him much credit, that when <HI>Hammond</HI> demanded that <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> &s;hould remain with him whil&s;t the other went to the King, which <HI>A&s;h|burnham</HI> refu&s;ed to do, <HI>Berkley</HI> did offer him&s;elf to remain with him whil&s;t <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> &s;hould attend his Maje&s;ty; &s;o that the whole weight of the prejudice and reproach was ca&s;t upon <HI>A&s;hburnham;</HI> who was known to have &s;o great an Intere&s;t in the Affections of his Maje&s;ty, and &s;o great an influence upon his coun&s;els and re&s;olutions, that he could <MILESTONE N="40"> not be ignorant of any thing that moved him.</P>
<P>THE not having a Ship ready, if it were intended, was unexcu&s;able; and the putting the King into <HI>Hammond</HI>'s hands without his leave, could never be wiped out. There were &s;ome who &s;aid, that <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> re&s;olv'd that the King &s;hould go to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> before he left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court; and the Lord <HI>Langdale</HI> often &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that being in M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI>'s Chamber at that time, he had the curio&s;ity, whil&s;t the other went out of the Room, to look upon a Paper that lay upon the Table; in which was writ, that it would be be&s;t for the King to withdraw from the Army, where he was in &s;uch danger; and that the <MILESTONE N="50"> I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> would be a good retreat, where Colonel <HI>Hammond</HI> Com|manded;&endq;</Q> who was a very hone&s;t Man. And this was &s;ome days before his Maje&s;ty removed. And then it was ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>Hammond</HI> him|&s;elf
<PB N="62" REF="840">
left the Army but two or three days before the King's remove, and went to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> at a Sea&s;on when there was no vi&s;ible occa&s;ion to draw him thither, and when the Agitators in the Army were at highe&s;t; and it was looked upon with the more wonder, becau&s;e <HI>A&s;h|burnham</HI> was not afterwards called in Que&s;tion for being in&s;trumental in the King's going away, but liv'd unque&s;tion'd long after in the &s;ight of the Parliament, and in conver&s;ation with &s;ome of the Officers of the Army who had mo&s;t deceiv'd him; and, which was more cen&s;ured than all the re&s;t, that after the Murther of the King he compounded, as was reported, at an ea&s;y rate, and liv'd at ea&s;e, and grew rich, for many <MILESTONE N="10"> years together without interruption.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, he pre&s;erv'd his reputation and credit with the mo&s;t eminent of the King's Party; and his remaining in <HI>England</HI> was upon the Marriage of a Lady by whom he had a great Fortune, and many conveniencies; which would have been &s;ei&s;ed by his leaving the Kingdom; and he did &s;end over to the King, and had leave to &s;tay there; and &s;ometimes &s;upplied the King with con&s;iderable Sums of Money. Afterwards he was committed to the Tower by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> where he remain'd till his death; and the King was known to have had, to the la&s;t, a clear opinion of his Affection, and Integrity; and when King <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Charles</HI> the Second return'd, mo&s;t of tho&s;e of greate&s;t reputation, as the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> gave him a good Te&s;timony; yet then, the old di&s;cour&s;es were revived, and Major <HI>Huntington</HI> did affirm, <Q>&startq;that M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> did intend the King&endq; &s;hould go to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> before he left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court.</Q> Many who did not believe him to be corrupted, did &s;till think that <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> had overwitted him, and per&s;waded him, upon great pro|mi&s;es, that it &s;hould prove for his Maje&s;ties benefit, and that they &s;hould the &s;ooner do his bu&s;ine&s;s, that he &s;hould withdraw from the Army, and put him&s;elf into <HI>Hammond</HI>'s hands; for if in truth tran&s;portation had <MILESTONE N="30"> been thought of, it is hard to believe that a Ship would not have been provided.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who, &s;hortly after the King's being in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> had tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>France,</HI> and remain'd &s;till with the Duke of <HI>York</HI> to the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's return, and M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> who continued in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o the more liable to reproach, had been &s;o &s;ollicitous to wipe off the a&s;per&s;ions which were ca&s;t upon them joyntly, that they had it in care to pre&s;erve the repu|tation of a joynt innocence; but whil&s;t each endeavour'd to clear him|&s;elf, he objected or imputed &s;omewhat to the other, that made him <MILESTONE N="40"> liable to ju&s;t cen&s;ure; and, in this contention, their Friends mention'd their &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es &s;o loudly, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately for the credit and reputation of him whom they lov'd be&s;t, that they contracted a very avow'd Animo&s;ity again&s;t each other; in&s;omuch as it was generally be|liev'd upon the King's Return, that they would, with &s;ome fiercene&s;s, have expo&s;tulated with each other in that way which angry Men choo&s;e to determine the right, or that both of them would have de&s;ired the King to have cau&s;ed the whole to be &s;o &s;trictly examin'd, that the world might have di&s;cern'd, where the faults or over&s;ights had been, if no wor&s;e could have been charged upon them: but they applied them&s;elves <MILESTONE N="50"> to neither of tho&s;e expedients, and liv'd only as Men who took no de|light in each others Conver&s;ation, and who did not de&s;ire to cheri&s;h any familiarity together. And the King, who was &s;atisfied that there had
<PB N="63" REF="850">
been no Trea&s;onable contrivance (from which his Father had ab&s;olv'd them) did not think it fit, upon &s;uch a Subject, to make &s;trict inqui&s;i|tion into Inadvertencies, Indi&s;cretions, and Pre&s;umptions, which could not have been puni&s;hed proportionally.</P>
<P>IT is true that they both writ Apologies, or Narrations of all that had pa&s;&s;ed in that Affair, which they made not publick, but gave in writing to &s;uch of their Friends in who&s;e opinions they mo&s;t de&s;ired to be ab&s;olv'd, without any Inclination that one &s;hould &s;ee what the other had writ; in which, though there were &s;everal reflections upon each other, and differences in occurrences of le&s;s moment, there was nothing <MILESTONE N="10"> in either that &s;eem'd to doubt of the Integrity of the other; nor any clear relation of any probable inducement that prevailed with the King to undertake that Journey. I have read both their Relations, and con|ferr'd with both of them at large, to di&s;cover in truth what the motives might be which led to &s;o fatal an end; and, if I were obliged to deliver my own opinion, I &s;hould declare that neither of them were, in any degree, corrupted in their Loyalty or Affection to the King, or &s;uborn'd to gratify any Per&s;ons with a di&s;&s;ervice to their Ma&s;ter. They were both of them great Opiniators, yet irre&s;olute, and ea&s;y to be &s;haken by any thing they had not thought of before; and exceedingly undervalued <MILESTONE N="20"> each others under&s;tanding; but, as it u&s;ually falls out in Men of that kind of Compo&s;ition, and Talent, they were both di&s;po&s;ed to commu|nicate more freely with, and, con&s;equently, to be advi&s;ed by new Ac|quaintance, and Men they had lately begun to know, than old Friends, and &s;uch who&s;e judgements they could not but e&s;teem; who they had no mind &s;hould go &s;harers with them in the merit of any notable Ser|vice which they thought them&s;elves able to bring to pa&s;s. Then, in the whole managery of the King's bu&s;ine&s;s, from the time that they came into the Army, they never conver&s;ed with the &s;ame Per&s;ons; but go|vern'd them&s;elves by what they receiv'd from tho&s;e who&s;e corre&s;pon|dence <MILESTONE N="30"> they had cho&s;en. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> &s;eem'd wholely to rely upon <HI>Crom|well,</HI> and <HI>Ireton;</HI> and rather upon what they &s;aid to others than to him&s;elf. For be&s;ides outward Civilities, which they both exerci&s;ed to|wards him more than to other Men, they &s;eldom held private di&s;cour&s;e with him, per&s;wading him <Q>&startq;that it was better for both their ends, in re&s;pect of the jealou&s;y the Parliament had of them, that they &s;hould under&s;tand each others mind, as to the tran&s;action of any particulars, from third Per&s;ons mutually intru&s;ted between them, than from fre|quent&endq; con&s;ultations together;</Q> and S^r <HI>Edward Ford,</HI> who had Mar|ried <HI>Ireton</HI>'s Si&s;ter, but had been him&s;elf an Officer in the King's Army <MILESTONE N="40"> from the beginning of the War, and a Gentleman of good meaning, though not able to fathom the re&s;erv'd and dark de&s;igns of his Brother in Law, was tru&s;ted to pa&s;s between them, with &s;ome other Officers of the Army, who had given <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> rea&s;on to believe that they had hone&s;t Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>BERKLEY had not found that re&s;pect, from <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> that he expected; at lea&s;t di&s;cern'd it to be greater towards <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> than it was to Him; which he thought evidence enough of a defect of judgement in them; and therefore had applied him&s;elf to others, who had not &s;o great Names, but greater Intere&s;t, as he thought, in the Sol|diers. <MILESTONE N="50"> His chief confidence was in D^r <HI>Staines,</HI> who, though a D^r in Phy|&s;ick, was Quarter Ma&s;ter General of the Army; and one <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> who was Scout Ma&s;ter General of the Army; both of the Council of War,
<PB N="64" REF="860">
both in good credit with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and both notable Fanaticks, and profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Presbyterians, and, no doubt, were both permitted, and in&s;tructed to care&s;s S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> and, by admiring his wi&s;dom and conduct, to oblige him to depend on theirs; and di&s;&s;imulation had &s;o great, and &s;upreme an influence on the Hearts and Spirits of all tho&s;e who were tru&s;ted, and imployed by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that no Man was &s;afe in their Company, but he who re&s;olv'd before, not to believe one word they &s;aid. The&s;e two Per&s;ons knew well how to humour S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who believ'd them the more, becau&s;e they &s;eem'd very much to blame <HI>Ireton</HI>'s &s;tubbornne&s;s towards the King, and <MILESTONE N="10"> to fear that he often prevailed upon <HI>Cromwell</HI> again&s;t his own Inclina|tions: They inform'd him of many particulars which pa&s;&s;ed in the Coun|cil of Officers, and &s;ometimes of advice from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that was clean contrary to what the King receiv'd by <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> as his opinion, and which was found afterwards to be true (as it may be the other was too) which exceedingly confirm'd S^r <HI>John</HI> in the good opinion he had of his two Friends. They were the fir&s;t who po&s;itively adverti&s;ed the King by him, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> would never do him Service; and the fir&s;t who &s;eem'd to apprehend that the King's Per&s;on was in danger, and that there was &s;ome &s;ecret de&s;ign upon his Life. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>I DO not believe that S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> knew any thing of the King's purpo&s;e in his intended e&s;cape, or whither he re&s;olv'd to go, or, indeed, more of it than that he re&s;olv'd at &s;uch an hour, and in &s;uch a place, to take Hor&s;e, and was him&s;elf required to attend him; nor do I, in truth, think that the King him&s;elf, when he took Hor&s;e, re&s;olv'd whither to go. Some think he meant to go into the City; others, that he intended for <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> and that was the ground of the Que&s;tion to M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;where is the Ship?</Q> Certain it is that the King never thought of going to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI> I am not &s;ure that M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> who had not yet given over all hope of the chief Officers of the Army, and be|liev'd <MILESTONE N="30"> the alterations, which had fallen out, proceeded from the barba|rity of the Agitators, and the Levelling Party, had not the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> in his view from the beginning, that is, from the time his Maje&s;ty thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make an e&s;cape from the Army. It had been a difficult task to go about to di&s;&s;wade the King from an apprehen&s;ion of his own &s;afety, when it was much more natural to &s;ear an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, than to apprehend any thing that they did afterwards do. M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> had &s;o great a dete&s;tation of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that he expected no good from their fraternity, the Presbyterians of the City; and did really believe that if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould put him&s;elf into their hands, as was advi&s;ed by many, <MILESTONE N="40"> with a purpo&s;e that he &s;hould be there concealed, till &s;ome favourable conjuncture &s;hould offer it &s;elf (for no body imagin'd that, upon his ar|rival there, the City would have declared for him, and have enter'd into a Conte&s;t with that Army which had &s;o lately &s;ubdued them) the &s;ecurity of &s;uch an e&s;cape was not to be relied on, and very earne&s;tly di&s;&s;waded his Ma&s;ter from entertaining the thought of it; and this opi|nion of his was univer&s;ally known, and, as hath been &s;aid before, was an ingredient into the compo&s;ition of that civility and kindne&s;s the Of|ficers of the Army had for him. They did, to him, frequently lament the Levelling Spirit that was gotten into the Soldiers, which they fore|&s;aw <MILESTONE N="50"> would in the future be as inconvenient, and mi&s;chievous to them|&s;elves, as it was, for the pre&s;ent, dangerous to the Per&s;on of the King; which they &s;eem'd wonderfully to apprehend, and prote&s;ted <Q>&startq;that they
<PB N="65" REF="870">
knew not how to apply any remedy to it, whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty was in the Army; but that they would quickly correct or &s;ubdue it, if the&endq; King were at any di&s;tance from them;</Q> and it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that, in &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ome body who was tru&s;ted by them, if not one of them&s;elves, might mention the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> as a good place to retire to, and Colonel <HI>Hammond</HI> as a Man of good intentions; the minutes of which di&s;cour&s;e M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> might keep by him; for the Lord <HI>Langdale</HI>'s relation of &s;uch a Paper, which he him&s;elf &s;aw, and read, cannot be thought by me to be a meer fiction; to which, be&s;ides that he was a Per&s;on of unblemi&s;hed honour and veracity, he had not any <MILESTONE N="10"> temptation; yet M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> did con&s;tantly deny that he ever &s;aw any &s;uch Paper, or had any thought of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> when the King left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and he never gave cau&s;e, in the &s;ub&s;equent Actions of his Life, to have his fidelity &s;u&s;pected. And it is probable, that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who many years afterwards committed him to the Tower, and did hate him, and de&s;ired to have taken his Life, would have been glad to have bla&s;ted his reputation, by declaring that he had carried his Ma&s;ter to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> without his privity, upon his own pre|&s;umption; which, how well &s;oever intended, mu&s;t have been looked upon by all Men as &s;uch a tran&s;cendent crime, as mu&s;t have deprived <MILESTONE N="20"> him of all compa&s;&s;ion for the wor&s;t that could befal him.</P>
<P>THE &s;uddain unexpected withdrawing of the King, made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of all Men, every Man fancying that his Maje&s;ty would do that which He wi&s;hed he would do. The Presbyte|rians imagined that he lay concealed in the City (which they unrea&s;on|ably thought he might ea&s;ily do) and would expect a proper conjuncture, upon a new rupture between the Parliament, and the Army, and the many factions in the Army, which every day appear'd, to di&s;cover him|&s;elf. The Cavaliers hoped that he would tran&s;port him&s;elf into the parts beyond the Seas, and quietly attend there, tho&s;e alterations at <MILESTONE N="30"> home, which might probably in a &s;hort time invite his return. The Army was not without this apprehen&s;ion, as imagining it the wor&s;t that could fall out to their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, that is, that part of it that was devoted to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment's beha|viour upon the news of the King's withdrawing, and where he was.</NOTE> Army, was mo&s;t frighted with the imagination that the King was in the City, and would lurk there until &s;ome con&s;piracy &s;hould be ripe, and all his Party &s;hould be pre&s;ent in <HI>London</HI> to &s;econd it; and therefore they no &s;ooner heard that he was gone from <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, than they pa&s;&s;ed an Ordinance of both Hou&s;es, by which they declared, <Q>&startq;that it &s;hould be confi&s;cation of E&s;tate, and lo&s;s of Life, to any Man who <MILESTONE N="40"> pre&s;umed to harbour and conceal the King's Per&s;on in his Hou&s;e,&endq; without revealing,</Q> and making it known to the Parliament: which, no doubt, would have terrified them all in &s;uch a manner, that if he had been in truth among&s;t them, he would quickly have been di&s;co|ver'd, and given up. They cau&s;ed &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious Presby|terians Hou&s;es to be &s;earched, as if they had been &s;ure he had been there; and &s;ent Po&s;ts to all Ports of the Kingdom, <Q>&startq;that they might be &s;hut, and no Per&s;on be &s;uffer'd to embark, le&s;t the King, in di&s;gui&s;e,&endq; tran&s;port him&s;elf;</Q> and a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out, <Q>&startq;for the ba|ni&s;hing all Per&s;ons who had ever borne Armes for the King, out of&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>London,</HI> or any place within twenty miles of it;</Q> and all Per&s;ons of that kind, who, upon &s;trict &s;earch, were found, were apprehended, and put into &s;everal Pri&s;ons with all the circum&s;tances of &s;everity and
<PB N="66" REF="880">
rigour. But all the&s;e doubts were quickly clear'd, and, within two days, <HI>Cromwell</HI> inform'd the Hou&s;e of Commons, <Q>&startq;that he had receiv'd Let|ters from Colonel <HI>Hammond,</HI> of all the manner of the King's coming to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> and the Company that came with him; that he remain'd there in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Carisbrooke,</HI> till the plea&s;ure of the&endq; Parliament &s;hould be known.</Q> <Q>He a&s;&s;ured them, &startq;that Colonel <HI>Ham|mond</HI> was &s;o hone&s;t a Man, and &s;o much devoted to their Service, that they need have no jealou&s;y that he might be corrupted by any&endq; Body;</Q> and all this relation he made with &s;o unu&s;ual a gaiety, that all Men concluded that the King was where He wi&s;hed he &s;hould be. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>AND now the Parliament maintain'd no farther conte&s;ts with the Army, but tamely &s;ubmitted to what&s;oever they propo&s;ed; the Pre&s;|byterians in both Hou&s;es, and in the City, being in a terrible Agony, that &s;ome clo&s;e corre&s;pondences they had held with the King during his abode at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, would be di&s;cover'd; and therefore would give no farther occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y by any contradictions, leaving it to their Clergy to keep the fire burning in the hearts of the People by their Pulpit-Inflamations; and they &s;toutly di&s;charged their tru&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Cromwell</HI> had more cau&s;e to fear a fire in his own Quarters, and that he had rai&s;ed a Spirit in the Army which would not ea&s;ily be quieted <MILESTONE N="20"> again. The Agitators, who were fir&s;t form'd by him to oppo&s;e the Par|liament, and to re&s;i&s;t the de&s;tructive doom of their disbanding, and likewi&s;e to prevent any inconvenience, or mi&s;chief, that might re&s;ult from the drow&s;y, dull Presbyterian humour of <HI>Fairfax;</HI> who wi&s;hed nothing that <HI>Cromwell</HI> did, and yet contributed to bring it all to pa&s;s: The&s;e Agitators, had hitherto tran&s;cribed faithfully all the Copies he had given them, and offer'd &s;uch Advices to the Parliament, and in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;uch expo&s;tulations and demands, as were nece&s;&s;ary, whil&s;t there was either any purpo&s;e to treat with the King or any rea&s;on to flatter his Party. But now the King was gone from the Army, and in &s;uch a <MILESTONE N="30"> place as the Army could have no recour&s;e to him, and that the Parlia|ment was become of &s;o &s;oft a temper, that the Party of the Army that was in it, could make all nece&s;&s;ary impre&s;&s;ion upon them, He de&s;ired to re&s;train the Agitators from that Liberty which they had &s;o long en|joyed, and to keep them within &s;tricter Rules of obedience to their Su|periors, and to hinder their future meetings, and con&s;ultations concern|ing the &s;ettling the Government of the Kingdom; which, he thought, ought now to be &s;olely left to the Parliament; who&s;e Authority, for the pre&s;ent, he thought be&s;t to uphold, and by it to e&s;tabli&s;h all that was to be done. But the Agitators would not be &s;o di&s;mi&s;s'd from State Af|fairs; <MILESTONE N="40"> of which they had &s;o plea&s;ant a reli&s;h; nor be at the mercy of the Parliament, which they had &s;o much provoked; and therefore, when they were admitted no more to con&s;ultations with their Officers, they continued their meetings without them; and thought there was as great need to reform their Officers, as any part of the Church or State. They enter'd into new A&s;&s;ociations, and made many Propo&s;itions to their Of|ficers, and to the Parliament, to introduce an equality into all condi|tions, and a parity among all Men; from whence they had the Appel|lation of <HI>Levellers;</HI> which appear'd a great Party. They did not only meet again&s;t the expre&s;s Command of their Officers, but drew very con|&s;iderable <MILESTONE N="50"> parties of the Army to Rendezvous, without the Order or Privity of their Superiors; and there per&s;waded them to enter into &s;uch Engagements, as would in a &s;hort time have di&s;&s;olv'd the Government
<PB N="67" REF="890">
of the Army, and ab&s;olv'd them from a dependence upon their General Officers. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of this Licence, put <HI>Cromwell</HI> to the expence of all his cunning, dexterity, and courage; &s;o that after he had cajoled the Parliament, as if the pre&s;ervation of Their Authority had been all he cared for and took to heart, and &s;ent &s;ome &s;al&s;e Brothers to comply in the coun&s;els of the Con&s;pirators, by that means having notice of their Rendezvous, he was unexpectedly found with an ordinary Guard at tho&s;e meetings; and, with a marvellous vivacity, having asked &s;ome Que&s;tions of tho&s;e whom he ob&s;erv'd mo&s;t active, and receiving in&s;olent An&s;wers, he knocked two or three of them in the head with his own <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;es a Tumult of the Levellers.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> hand, and then charged the re&s;t with his Troop; and took &s;uch a num|ber of them as he thought fit; whereof he pre&s;ently cau&s;ed &s;ome to be hanged, and &s;ent others to <HI>London</HI> to a more formal Tryal. By two or three &s;uch encounters, for the ob&s;tinacy continued long, he totally &s;ub|dued that Spirit in the Army, though it continued and encrea&s;ed very much in the Kingdom; and if it had not been encounter'd at that time with that rough and brisk temper of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> it would pre&s;ently have produced all imaginable confu&s;ion in the Parliament, Army, and Kingdom.</P>
<P>ALL oppo&s;ition being thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and quieted, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> needing no other a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the carrying on his de&s;igns, than the pre|&s;ent temper and inclination of the Parliament, they &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the King, briefly propo&s;ing to him, <Q>&startq;that he would forthwith grant his&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment &s;ends a Me&s;&s;age to the King to pa&s;s four Acts.</NOTE> Royal A&s;&s;ent to four Acts of Parliament,</Q> which they then &s;ent to him. By one of them, he was to confe&s;s the War to have been rai&s;ed by him again&s;t the Parliament; and &s;o that he was guilty of all the Blood that had been &s;pilt. By another, he was totally to di&s;&s;olve the Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops, and to grant all the Lands belonging to the Church to &s;uch u&s;es as they propo&s;ed; leaving the &s;ettling a future Go|vernment in the place thereof to farther time and Coun&s;els. By a third, <MILESTONE N="30"> he was to grant, and &s;ettle the Militia in the Manner and in the Per|&s;ons propo&s;ed, re&s;erving not &s;o much power in him&s;elf as any Subject was capable of. In the la&s;t place, he was, in effect, to &s;acrifice all tho&s;e who had &s;erv'd, or adher'd to him, to the Mercy of the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Per&s;ons who were &s;ent with the&s;e four Bills, had liberty given to expect the King's An&s;wer only four days, and were then required to return to the Parliament. With the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Parliament there came likewi&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who, after the four Bills were deliver'd, and read to the King, the very next day, de&s;ired an Au|dience; and, with much formality and confidence, deliver'd a Declara|tion, <MILESTONE N="40"> and Prote&s;tation on the behalf of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e Bills and Propo&s;itions. <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;they were &s;o prejudicial to Religion, the Crown, and the Union, and Intere&s;t of the Kingdoms, and &s;o far different from the former proceedings and engagements be|tween the two Kingdoms, that they could not concur therein; and therefore, in the name of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> did declare&endq; their di&s;&s;ent.</Q> The King had receiv'd Adverti&s;ement, that a&s;&s;oon as he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commi&s;+&s;ioners of</HI> Scotland <HI>enter a Prote&s;tation again&s;t them</HI></NOTE> &s;hould refu&s;e to con&s;ent to the Bills, he &s;hould pre&s;ently be made a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner, and all his Servants &s;hould be removed from him; upon which, and becau&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ioners had no power to treat with him, but <MILESTONE N="50"> were only to receive his po&s;itive An&s;wer, he re&s;olv'd that his An&s;wer &s;hould not be known till it was deliver'd to the Parliament; and that, in the mean time, he would endeavour to make his e&s;cape, before new

Orders could be &s;ent from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> &s;o when the Commi&s;&s;ioners came to receive his An&s;wer, he gave it to them &s;ealed. The Earl of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gives his An|&s;wer to the Parliament Commi&s;&s;ioners.</NOTE> <HI>Denbigh,</HI> who was the chief of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and a Per&s;on very ungracious to the King, told him, <Q>&startq;that though they had no Authority to treat with him, or to do any thing but to receive his An&s;wer, yet they were not to be looked upon as Common Me&s;&s;engers, and to carry&endq; back an An&s;wer that they had not &s;een: and, upon the matter, refu&s;ed to receive it;</Q> and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;they would return without any, except they&endq; might &s;ee what they carried.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty conceiv'd that their return without his An&s;wer would <MILESTONE N="10"> be attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences; and therefore he told them, <Q>&startq;that he had &s;ome rea&s;on for having offer'd to deliver it to them, in that manner; but if they would give him their words, that the communi|cating it to them &s;hould be attended with no prejudice to him, he would&endq; open it, and cau&s;e it to be read, which they readily undertook</Q> (as in truth they knew no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it) and thereupon he open'd it, and gave it one to read. <Q>The An&s;wer was, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty had allways thought it a matter of great difficulty to comply in &s;uch a manner with all engaged Intere&s;ts, that a firm and la&s;ting Peace might en&s;ue; in which opinion he was now confirm'd, &s;ince the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scot|land</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> do &s;olemnly prote&s;t again&s;t the &s;everal Bills, and Propo&s;itions, which the two Hou&s;es of Parliament had pre&s;ented to him for his A&s;|&s;ent; &s;o that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to give &s;uch an An&s;wer as&endq; might be the foundation of a hopeful Peace.</Q> He gave them many un|an&s;werable rea&s;ons, <Q>&startq;why he could not pa&s;s the four Bills as they were of|fer'd to him; which did not only deve&s;t him of all Soveraignty, and leave him without any po&s;&s;ibility of recovering it to him or his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, but open'd a door for all intolerable oppre&s;&s;ions upon his Sub|jects, he granting &s;uch an arbitrary and illimited power to the two&endq; Hou&s;es.</Q> He told them, <Q>&startq;that neither the de&s;ire of being freed from that <MILESTONE N="30"> tedious and irk&s;ome condition of Life, which he had &s;o long &s;uffer'd, nor the apprehen&s;ion of any thing that might befal him, &s;hould ever prevail with him to con&s;ent to any one Act, till the conditions of the whole Peace &s;hould be concluded; and then that he would be ready to give all ju&s;t and rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction, in all particulars; and for the adju&s;ting of all this, he knew no way but a per&s;onal Treaty (and there|fore very earne&s;tly de&s;ired the two Hou&s;es to con&s;ent to it) to be either at&endq; <HI>London,</HI> or any other place they would rather choo&s;e.</Q> A&s;&s;oon as this An&s;wer, or to the &s;ame effect, was read, he deliver'd it to the Commi&s;|&s;ioners; who no &s;ooner receiv'd it than they ki&s;s'd his hand, and departed <MILESTONE N="40"> for <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners were no &s;ooner gone than <HI>Hammond</HI> cau&s;ed all <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pre&s;ently af|ter,</HI> Ham|mond <HI>re+moves the King's old Servants from about him.</HI></NOTE> the King's Servants, who till then had all Liberty to be with him, to be immediately put out of the Ca&s;tle; and forbid any of them to repair thi|ther any more; and appointed a &s;trong Guard to re&s;train any Body from going to the King, if they &s;hould endeavour it. This exceedingly troubled, and &s;urpri&s;ed him, being an ab&s;olute di&s;appointment of all the hope he had left. <Q>He told <HI>Hammond,</HI> &startq;that it was not &s;uitable to his engage|ment, and that it did not become a Man of honour or hone&s;ty to treat him &s;o, who had &s;o freely put him&s;elf into his hands. He asked him, <MILESTONE N="50"> whether the Commi&s;&s;ioners were acquainted with his purpo&s;e to pro|ceed&endq; in this manner?</Q> to which he An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that they were not; but that he had an Order from the Parliament to do as he had done; and

that he &s;aw plainly by his An&s;wer to the Propo&s;itions, that he acted&endq; by other coun&s;els than &s;tood with the good of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS in&s;olent and imperious proceeding, put the I&s;land (which was generally inhabited by a People allways well affected to the Crown) into a high mutiny. <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;they would not endure to &s;ee their King &s;o&endq; u&s;ed, and made a Pri&s;oner.</Q> There was at that time there one Captain <HI>Burly,</HI> who was of a good Family in the I&s;land. He had been a Captain of one of the King's Ships, and was put out of his Command when the Fleet rebell'd again&s;t the King; and then he put him&s;elf into the King's Army, where he continued an Officer of good Account to the end of the <MILESTONE N="10"> War, and was in one of the King's Armies General of the Ordnance. When the War was at an end, he repaired into his own Country, the I&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> where many of his Family &s;till lived in good reputation. This Gentleman chanced to be at <HI>Newport,</HI> the Chief Town in the I&s;land, when the King was thus treated, and when the People &s;eem'd generally to re&s;ent it with &s;o much indignation; and was &s;o much tran&s;ported <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thereupon Captain</HI> Burly <HI>&s;tirs up the People in the I&s;land; but is quickly &s;up|pre&s;s'd, con|demn'd, and executed.</HI></NOTE> with the &s;ame fury, being a Man of more courage than of prudence and circum&s;pection, that he cau&s;ed a Drum to be pre&s;ently beaten, and put him&s;elf at the head of the People who flocked together, and cryed <Q>&startq;for&endq; God, the King, and the People;</Q> and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he would lead them to the&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> Ca&s;tle, and re&s;cue the King from his Captivity.</Q> The attempt was pre|&s;ently di&s;cern'd to be irrational, and impo&s;&s;ible; and by the great dili|gence, and activity of the King's Servants, who had been put out of the Ca&s;tle, the People were quieted, and all Men re&s;orted to their own Hou&s;es; but the poor Gentleman paid dear for his ill advi&s;ed and precipitate Loyalty. For <HI>Hammond</HI> cau&s;ed him pre&s;ently to be made Pri&s;oner; and the Parliament, without delay, &s;ent down a Commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer;</HI> in which an infamous Judge, <HI>Wild,</HI> whom they had made Chief Baron of the Exchequer for &s;uch Services, pre&s;ided; who cau&s;ed poor <HI>Burly</HI> to be, with all formality, indicted of High Trea&s;on for Levy|ing <MILESTONE N="30"> War again&s;t the King, and engaging the Kingdom in a new War; of which the Jury they had brought together, found him guilty; upon which their Judge condemn'd him, and the hone&s;t Man was forthwith hanged, drawn, and quarter'd, with all the circum&s;tances of barbarity and cruelty; which &s;truck a wonderful terror into all Men, this being the fir&s;t precedent of their having brought any Man to a formal Legal Trial by the Law to deprive him of his Life, and make him guilty of High Trea&s;on for adhering to the King; and it made a deeper impre&s;&s;ion upon the hearts of all Men, than all the cruelties they had yet exerci&s;ed by their Courts of War; which, though they took away the Lives of many <MILESTONE N="40"> innocent Men, left their E&s;tates to their Wives and Children; but when they &s;aw now, that they might be condemn'd of High Trea&s;on before a &s;worn Judge of the Law for &s;erving the King, by which their E&s;tates would be likewi&s;e confi&s;cated, they thought they &s;hould be ju&s;tified if they kept their Hearts entire, without being involved by their Actions in a Capital tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>

exceed the other in the impudence and bitterne&s;s of his Invective. <Q><HI>Crom|well</HI> declared, &startq;that the King was a Man of great parts, and great un|der&s;tanding&endq;</Q> (faculties they had hitherto endeavour'd to have him thought to be without) <Q>&startq;but that he was &s;o great a di&s;&s;embler, and &s;o&endq; fal&s;e a Man, that he was not to be tru&s;ted.</Q> And thereupon, repeated many particulars, whil&s;t he was in the Army, that his Maje&s;ty wi&s;h'd that &s;uch, and &s;uch things might be done, which being done to gratify him, he was di&s;plea&s;ed, and complain'd of it: <Q>&startq;that whil&s;t he profe&s;&s;ed with all &s;olemnity that he referr'd him&s;elf wholely to the Parliament, and de|pended only upon Their wi&s;dom and coun&s;el for the &s;ettlement and <MILESTONE N="10"> compo&s;ing the di&s;tractions of the Kingdom, he had, at the &s;ame time, &s;ecret Treaties with the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, how he might imbroil the Nation in a new War, and de&s;troy the Parliament. He concluded, that they might no farther trouble them&s;elves with &s;ending Me&s;&s;ages to him, or farther Propo&s;itions, but that they might enter upon tho&s;e coun&s;els which were nece&s;&s;ary towards the &s;ettlement of the Kingdom,&endq; without having farther recour&s;e to the King.</Q> Tho&s;e of his Party &s;e|conded this advice with new reproaches upon the Per&s;on of the King charging him with &s;uch abominable Actions, as had been never heard $$ and could be only &s;ugge&s;ted from the malice of their own hearts; whil&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> Men who had any mode&s;ty, and abhorr'd that way of proceeding, &s;tood amazed and confounded at the manner and pre&s;umption of it, and with|out courage to give any notable oppo&s;ition to their rage. So that, after &s;everal days &s;pent in pa&s;&s;ionate debates to this purpo&s;e, they Voted <Q>&startq;that they would make no more Addre&s;&s;es to the King, but proceed towards <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vote of no more Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the King</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> &s;ettling the Government, and providing for the Peace of the Kingdom, in &s;uch manner as they &s;hould judge be&s;t for the benefit and liberty of&endq; the Subject: and a Committee was appointed to prepare a Declaration to inform and &s;atisfy the People of this their re&s;olution,</Q> and the grounds thereof, and to a&s;&s;ure them, <Q>&startq;that they had Lawful Authority to pro|ceed&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> in this manner.</Q> In the mean time, the King, who had, from the time of his coming to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> enjoyed the liberty of taking the Air, and refre&s;hing him&s;elf throughout the I&s;land, and was attended by &s;uch Servants as he had appointed, or &s;ent for, to come thither to him, to the time that he had refu&s;ed to pa&s;s tho&s;e Bills, from thenceforth was no more &s;uffer'd to go out of the Ca&s;tle beyond a little ill Garden that be|longed to it. And now, after this Vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that there &s;hould be no more Addre&s;&s;es made to him, all his Servants being removed, a few new Men, for the mo&s;t part, unknown to his Maje&s;ty, were deputed to be about his Per&s;on to perform all tho&s;e Offices which <MILESTONE N="40"> they believ'd might be requi&s;ite, and of who&s;e fidelity to them&s;elves they were as well a&s;&s;ured, as that they were without any reverence or af|fection for the King.</P>
<P>IT is very true, that within few days after the King's withdrawing from <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and after it was known that he was in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> there was a meeting of the General Officers of the Army at <HI>Wind|&s;or;</HI> where <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> were pre&s;ent, to con&s;ult what &s;hould <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A meeting of</HI> Cromwell <HI>and the Offi|cers at</HI> Wind|&s;or, <HI>wherein they de&s;ign the King's De&s;truction.</HI></NOTE> be now done with the King. For, though <HI>Cromwell</HI> was weary of the Agitators, and re&s;olv'd to break their meetings, and though the Parlia|ment concurr'd in all he de&s;ired, yet his entire confidence was in the Of|ficers <MILESTONE N="50"> of the Army; who were they who &s;wayed the Parliament, and the Army it &s;elf, to bring what he intended to pa&s;s. At this conference, the preliminaries whereof were allways Fa&s;tings and Prayers, made at the very

Council by <HI>Cromwell</HI> or <HI>Ireton,</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>in&s;pired</HI> Per&s;on, as mo&s;t of the Officers were, it was re&s;olv'd <Q>&startq;that the King &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted&endq; for his Life as a criminal Per&s;on: of which his Maje&s;ty was adverti&s;ed &s;peedily by <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI></Q> Quarter Ma&s;ter General of the Army; who was pre|&s;ent; and had pretended, from the fir&s;t coming of the King to the Army, to have a de&s;ire to &s;erve him, and de&s;ired to be now thought to retain it; but the re&s;olution was a great &s;ecret, of which the Parliament had not the lea&s;t intimation, or jealou&s;y; but was, as it had been, to be cozen'd by degrees to do what they never intended. Nor was his Maje&s;ty ea&s;ily per&s;waded to give credit to the information; but though he expected, <MILESTONE N="10"> and thought it very probable, that they would Murther him, he did not believe they would attempt it with that formality, or let the People know their Intentions. The great approach they made towards it, was, their Declaration <Q>&startq;&endq;that they would make no more Addre&s;&s;es to the King, that by an Interregnum they might feel the pul&s;e of the People, and di&s;|cover how they would &s;ubmit to another form of Government;</Q> and yet all Writs, and Proce&s;s of Ju&s;tice, and all Commi&s;&s;ions, &s;till i&s;&s;ued in the King's Name without his con&s;ent or privity; and little other change or alteration, but that what was before done by the King him&s;elf, and by his immediate Order, was now perform'd by the Parliament; and, in&s;tead <MILESTONE N="20"> of Acts of Parliament, they made Ordinances of the two Hou&s;es to &s;erve all their occa&s;ions; which found the &s;ame obedience from the People.</P>

<P>THIS Declaration found much oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Commons, <MILESTONE N="40"> in re&s;pect of the particular reproaches they had now ca&s;t upon the Per&s;on of the King, which they had heretofore, in their own publi&s;hed Declara|tions to the People, charged upon the evil Coun&s;ellors, and Per&s;ons about him; and &s;ome Per&s;ons had been &s;entenced, and condemn'd, for tho&s;e very crimes which they now accu&s;ed his Maje&s;ty of. But there was much more exception to their conclu&s;ion from tho&s;e premi&s;es, that therefore they would addre&s;s them&s;elves no more to him; and <HI>John Maynard,</HI> a Member of the Hou&s;e, and a Lawyer of great eminence, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Maynard<HI>'s Argument a|gain&s;t it</HI></NOTE> who had too much complied and concurred with their irregular, and unju&s;t proceedings, after he had with great vehemence oppo&s;ed, and con|tradicted <MILESTONE N="50"> the mo&s;t odious Parts of their Declaration, told them plainly, <Q>&startq;that by this re&s;olution of making no more Addre&s;&s;es to the King, they did, as far as in Them lay, di&s;&s;olve the Parliament; and that, from the

time of that determination, he knew not with what &s;ecurity, in point of Law, they could meet together, or any Man joyn with them in their coun&s;els: That it was of the E&s;&s;ence of Parliament, that they &s;hould upon all occa&s;ions repair to the King; and that his Maje&s;ties refu&s;al at any time to receive their Petitions, or to admit their Addre&s;&s;es, had been allways held the highe&s;t breach of their Privilege, becau&s;e it tended to their di&s;&s;olution without di&s;&s;olving them; and therefore if they &s;hould now, on their parts, determine that they would receive no more Me&s;&s;ages from him (which was likewi&s;e a part of their Declaration) nor make any more addre&s;s to him, they did, upon the matter, declare <MILESTONE N="10"> that they were no longer a Parliament; and then, how could the Peo|ple&endq; look upon them as &s;uch?</Q> This Argumentation being boldly pre&s;s'd by a Man of that Learning and Authority, who had very &s;eldom not been believ'd, made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon all Men who had not pro|&s;tituted them&s;elves to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Party. But the other &s;ide meant not to maintain their re&s;olution by di&s;cour&s;es, well knowing where their &s;trength lay; and &s;o &s;till called for the Que&s;tion; which was carried by a plurality of Voices, as they fore&s;aw it would; very many Per&s;ons who abhorr'd the determination, not having Courage to provoke the powerful Men by owning their di&s;&s;ent; others, &s;atisfying them&s;elves <MILESTONE N="20"> with the re&s;olution to withdraw them&s;elves, and to bear no farther part in the coun&s;els; which <HI>Maynard</HI> him&s;elf did; and came no more to the Hou&s;e in very many Months, nor till there &s;eem'd to be &s;uch an al|teration in the minds of Men, that there would be a rever&s;al of that mon&s;trous determination; and many others did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>WHEN this Declaration was thus pa&s;&s;ed the Commons, and by them &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Peers for their concurrence, the Manner or the Mat|ter was of that importance as to need much debate; but, with as little formality as was po&s;&s;ible, it had the concurrence of that Hou&s;e, and was immediately printed, and publi&s;hed, and new Orders &s;ent to the I&s;le of <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Wight,</HI> for the more &s;trict looking to, and guarding the King, that he might not e&s;cape.</P>
<P>THE publi&s;hing this Declaration wrought very different effects in the minds of the People, from what they expected it would produce; and it appear'd to be &s;o publickly dete&s;ted, that many who had &s;erv'd the Par|liament in &s;everal unwarrantable Imployments and Commi&s;&s;ions, from the beginning of the War, in the City and in the Country, withdrew them|&s;elves from the Service of the Parliament; and much inveighed again&s;t it, for declining all the Principles upon which they had engaged them. Many private Per&s;ons took upon them to publi&s;h An&s;wers to that De|claration, <MILESTONE N="40"> that, the King him&s;elf being under &s;o &s;trict a re&s;traint that he could make no An&s;wer, the People might not be poy&s;on'd with the belief of it. And the &s;everal An&s;wers of this kind wrought very much upon the People, who open'd their Mouths very loud again&s;t the Parliament and the Army; and the clamour was encrea&s;ed by the increa&s;e of Taxes, and Impo&s;itions, which were rai&s;ed by new Ordinances of Parliament upon the Kingdom; and though they were &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole Kingdom, and the Forces and Garri&s;ons thereof, that they had no Ene|my to fear or apprehend, yet they disbanded no part of their Army; and notwith&s;tanding they rai&s;ed incredible Sums of Money, upon the Sale <MILESTONE N="50"> of the Church and the Crown Lands; for which they &s;ound Purcha&s;ers enough among&s;t their own Party in the City, Army, and Country, and upon compo&s;ition with Delinquents, and the &s;ale of their Lands who

refu&s;ed, or could not be admitted to compound (which few refu&s;ed to do who could be admitted, in regard that their E&s;tates were all under Se|que&s;tration, and the Rents thereof paid to the Parliament, &s;o that till they compounded they had nothing to &s;upport them&s;elves, whereby they were driven into extreme wants and nece&s;&s;ities, and were compelled to make their Compo&s;itions, at how unrea&s;onable rates &s;oever, that they might thereby be enabled to &s;ell &s;ome part, to pre&s;erve the re&s;t, and their Hou&s;es from being pulled down, and their Woods from being wa&s;ted or &s;poiled) Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e va&s;t receipts, which they ever pretended &s;hould ea&s;e the People of their Burthen, and &s;hould &s;uffice to pay the Army their <MILESTONE N="10"> expences at Sea, and Land, their debts were &s;o great, that they rai&s;ed the publick Taxes; and, be&s;ides all Cu&s;toms, and Exci&s;e, they Levied a Monthly Contribution of above a hundred thou&s;and pounds by a Land Tax throughout the Kingdom; which was more than had been ever done before, and it being at a time when they had no Enemy who contended with them, was an Evidence that it would have no end, and that the Ar|my was &s;till to be kept up, to make good the re&s;olution they had taken, to have no more to do with the King; and that made the re&s;olution gene|rally the more odious. All this grew the more in&s;upportable, by rea&s;on that upon the publi&s;hing this la&s;t mon&s;trous Declaration, mo&s;t of tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="20"> Per&s;ons of condition, who, as hath been &s;aid before, had been &s;educed to do them Service throughout the Kingdom, declined to appear longer in &s;o dete&s;table an imployment; and now a more inferior &s;ort of the com|mon People &s;ucceeded in tho&s;e imployments, who thereby exerci&s;ed &s;o great in&s;olence over tho&s;e who were in Quality above them, and who all|ways had a power over them, that it was very grievous; and for this, let the circum&s;tances be what they would, no redre&s;s could be ever obtain'd, all di&s;tinction of Quality being renounced. They who were not above the condition of ordinary inferior Con&s;tables, &s;ix or &s;even years before, were now the Ju&s;tices of Peace, and Seque&s;trators, and Commi&s;&s;ioners; who <MILESTONE N="30"> executed the Commands of the Parliament, in all the Counties of the Kingdom, with &s;uch rigour and Tyranny, as was natural for &s;uch Per&s;ons to u&s;e over and towards tho&s;e upon whom they had formerly looked at &s;uch a di&s;tance. But let their &s;ufferings be never &s;o great, and the mur|mur and di&s;content never &s;o general, there was no &s;hadow of hope by which they might di&s;cern any po&s;&s;ible relief: &s;o that they who had &s;trug|gled as long as they were able, &s;ubmitted patiently to the Yoke, with the more &s;atisfaction, in that they &s;aw many of tho&s;e who had been the prin|cipal Contrivers of all the mi&s;chiefs to &s;atisfy their own Ambition, and that they might govern others, reduced to allmo&s;t as ill a condition as <MILESTONE N="40"> them&s;elves, at lea&s;t to as little Power, and Authority, and Security; whil&s;t the whole Government of the Nation remain'd, upon the matter, wholely in Their hands who in the beginning of the Parliament were &s;carce ever heard of, or their names known but in the places where they inhabited.</P>
<P>THE King being in this melancholick neglected Condition, and the Kingdom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the new Rulers, without controul, in the new me|thod of Government, where every thing was done, and &s;ubmitted to, which they propounded, they yet found that there was no foundation laid for their Peace, and future Security; that be&s;ides the general di&s;content of the Nation, which for the pre&s;ent they did not fear, they were to ex|pect <MILESTONE N="50"> new Troubles from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from <HI>Scotland;</HI> which would, in the Progre&s;s, have an influence upon <HI>England.</HI></P>

differences and conte&s;ts between the Parliament and the Army, and from the King's being in the Army) though they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and, upon the matter, of the whole Province of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> by the activity of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Broghill;</HI> yet the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels had very great Forces, which cover'd all the other parts of the Kingdom. But they had no kind of fears of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> whom they vanqui&s;hed as often as they &s;aw, and never declined fighting upon any inequality of Number: they had an apprehen&s;ion of another Enemy. The Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had often attended the King at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and had great re&s;ort to him, whil&s;t he &s;tayed in <HI>London,</HI> by all tho&s;e who had &s;erv'd the King, and not <MILESTONE N="10"> le&s;s by tho&s;e who were known to be un&s;atisfied with the proceedings both of the Parliament and the Army; and by the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, who had frequently private meetings with him; in&s;omuch as the Officers of the Army, who gave the fir&s;t motion to all extravagant Acts of power, had re&s;olv'd to have apprehended and impri&s;on'd him, as a Man worthy of their fear, though they had nothing to charge him with; and by his Articles, he had liberty to &s;tay &s;ix Months where he would in <HI>England</HI> (which time was little more than half expired) and then he might tran&s;|port him&s;elf into what part he de&s;ired beyond the Seas. The Marquis had notice of this their purpo&s;e; and having conferr'd with his Maje&s;ty <MILESTONE N="20"> as much as was nece&s;&s;ary, upon a rea&s;onable fore&s;ight of what was like to fall out, &s;hortly after, or about the time that the King left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, he in di&s;gui&s;e, and without being attended by more than one Ser|vant, rid into <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> and in an ob&s;cure and unguarded Port or Harbour, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>tran&s;ports him&s;elf out of</HI> England <HI>into</HI> France.</NOTE> put him&s;elf on board a Shallop, which &s;afely tran&s;ported him into <HI>Nor|mandy;</HI> from whence he waited upon the Queen, and the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI> to whom he could not but be very welcome.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, there were Commi&s;&s;ioners arriv'd from <HI>Ireland</HI> from the Confederate Roman Catholicks; who, after they had driven the King's Authority from them, quickly found they needed it for their <MILESTONE N="30"> own pre&s;ervation. The Factions grew &s;o great among&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> them|&s;elves, and the Pope's Nuntio exerci&s;ed his Authority with &s;o great Ty|ranny and In&s;olence, that all were weary of him; and found that the Par|liament, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould &s;end more Forces over, would ea&s;ily, by rea&s;on of their divi&s;ions, reduce them into great &s;treights, and nece&s;&s;ities. They therefore &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners to the Queen and Prince to de&s;ire, <Q>&startq;that by their favour, they might have the King's Authority again among&endq; them;</Q> to which they promi&s;ed, for the future, a ready obedience, with many acknowledgements of their former mi&s;carriage and ill behaviour. It is very true that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim,</HI> who was one of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners, <MILESTONE N="40"> and was allways in&s;eparable from the highe&s;t Ambition (though without any Qualifications for any great tru&s;t) had entertain'd the hope, that by the Queen's favour, who had too good an opinion of him, the Go|vernment of <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hould be committed to Him, and his conduct; which none of the other Commi&s;&s;ioners thought of, nor had their Eyes fixed on any Man but the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> in whom the King's Au|thority was ve&s;ted; for he remain'd &s;till Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI> by the King's Commi&s;&s;ion; and they had rea&s;on to believe that all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants, who had formerly liv'd under his Government (without a conjunction with whom, they well fore&s;aw the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> would not be able to <MILESTONE N="50"> defend or pre&s;erve them&s;elves) would return to the &s;ame obedience, a&s;|&s;oon as he &s;hould return to receive it. The Queen and the Prince thought not of tru&s;ting any other in that mo&s;t hazardous and difficult Imploy|ment,
<PB N="75" REF="970">
and &s;o referr'd the Commi&s;&s;ioners to make all their Overtures, and Propo&s;itions to him; who knew well enough, what they would not do if they could, and what they could not do if they had a mind to it; and how devoted &s;oever he was to the King's Service, nothing propo&s;ed or undertaken by them, could have been the lea&s;t inducement to him to engage him&s;elf, and to depend upon their fidelity. But there were three things, which with the great and entire Zeal for the King's Service, to which he had dedicated him&s;elf, made him believe that he might with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s appear again in that Kingdom, in this conjuncture; and that his &s;o doing, might have a good effect upon the temper of <HI>England</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> towards the mending his Maje&s;ties condition there.</P>
<P>FIRST, the Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> (who then ab&s;olutely govern'd <HI>France)</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Rea&s;ons that moved the Marquis to go again into</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> &s;eem'd very earne&s;tly to advi&s;e it, and promi&s;ed to &s;upply him with a good Sum of Money, and &s;tore of Armes and Ammunition to carry with him; which he knew very well how to di&s;po&s;e of there. Secondly, he was privy to the <HI>Scots</HI> Engagement, and to a re&s;olution of many Per&s;ons of great Honour in <HI>England,</HI> to appear in Armes at the &s;ame time; which was de&s;ign'd for the Summer following; whereby the Parliament, and Army, which were like to have new divi&s;ions among&s;t them&s;elves, would not be able to &s;end any con&s;iderable Supplies into <HI>Ireland;</HI> without <MILESTONE N="20"> which, their power there, was not like to be formidable. Thirdly, which was a greater Encouragement than the other two, he had, during his abode in <HI>England,</HI> held a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Province of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who had the full Power and Command of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army there; which was a better Body of Men than the Parliament had in any other part of that Kingdom. That Lord was weary of his Ma&s;ters, and did not think the Service he had done the Parliament (which indeed had been very great, and without which it is very probable that whole Kingdom had been united to his Maje&s;ties Service) well requited; and did really and heartily abhor the <MILESTONE N="30"> Proceedings of the Parliament, and Army, towards the King; and did therefore re&s;olve to redeem what he had formerly done ami&s;s, with ex|po&s;ing all he had for his Maje&s;ties Re&s;toration; and had frankly promi&s;ed the Marquis to receive him into <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> as the King's Lieutenant of that Kingdom; and that that whole Province, and Army, &s;hould pay him all obedience; and that again&s;t the time he &s;hould be &s;ure of his pre&s;ence, he would make a Ce&s;&s;ation with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in Order to a firm conjunction of that whole Kingdom for the King. After the Marquis came into <HI>France,</HI> he receiv'd &s;till Letters from that Lord to ha&s;ten his Journey thither.</P>
<P>THESE were the motives which di&s;po&s;ed the Marquis to comply with <MILESTONE N="40"> the Queen's, and the Prince's Command to prepare him&s;elf for that Ex|pedition; and &s;o he concerted all things with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners; who return'd into their Country, with promi&s;es to di&s;po&s;e their General A&s;&s;embly to con&s;ent to tho&s;e conditions as might not bring a greater pre|judice to the King, than any conjunction with them could be of Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>THE Parliament had too many Spies, and Agents at <HI>Paris,</HI> not to be inform'd of what&s;oever was whi&s;per'd there; but whether they underva|lued any conjunction with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> (for of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> they had no &s;u&s;picion) or were confident of the Cardinal's kindne&s;s, that he would <MILESTONE N="50"> not advance any de&s;ign again&s;t them, they were not &s;o apprehen&s;ive of trouble from <HI>Ireland</HI> as they were of their Brethren from <HI>Scotland;</HI> where they heard of great preparations, and of a purpo&s;e to call a Parlia|ment,

and to rai&s;e an Army; which, they believ'd, would find too many Friends in <HI>England,</HI> the Presbyterian Party holding up their heads again, both in the Parliament, and the City.

<P>AFTER the King had been &s;o infamou&s;ly deliver'd up to the Parlia|ment by the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and a&s;&s;oon as the Army had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of him, that Nation was in terrible Apprehen&s;ion that the Of|ficers <MILESTONE N="10"> of the Army would have made their Peace, and e&s;tabli&s;hed their own greatne&s;s by re&s;toring the King to his ju&s;t Rights, of which they had &s;o fouly depriv'd him; and then the con&s;cience of their guilt made them pre&s;ume, what Their Lot mu&s;t be; and therefore, the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ioners who had been joyn'd with the Committee of Parliament in all the tran&s;|actions, made ha&s;t to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> again to their old Seats, to keep their Intere&s;t; which was great in all the Presbyterian Party, both of Parlia|ment and City; for there remain'd &s;till the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion of maintain|ing the &s;trict Union between the two Kingdoms, and that all Tran&s;actions &s;hould be by joynt Coun&s;els. And a&s;&s;oon as the King appear'd with &s;ome <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;hew of Liberty, and his own Servants had leave to attend him, no Men appear'd with more confidence than the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners; the Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and the re&s;t; as if they had been the Men who had contriv'd his Re&s;toration: No Men in &s;o frequent Whi&s;pers with the King; and they found &s;ome way to get them&s;elves &s;o much believ'd by the Queen, with whom they held a diligent Corre&s;pon|dence, that her Maje&s;ty very earne&s;tly per&s;waded the King <Q>&startq;to tru&s;t them, as the only Per&s;ons who had power and credit to do him Service, and to&endq; redeem him from the captivity he was in.

<P><Q>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners who attended his Maje&s;ty, made great Apologies for what had been done, imputing it wholely to the &startq;malice and power of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and to his Credit, and Authority in the Council, and in the Army; &s;o that nothing could be done which was de&s;ired by hone&s;t Men; but that now Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> was among&s;t them, who <MILESTONE N="50"> they knew was mo&s;t devoted to his Maje&s;ty, they &s;hould be able to over power <HI>Argyle;</HI> and the proceedings of the Army and the Parliament, were &s;o foul, and &s;o contrary to their publick Faith, that they were

They required, as a thing without which nothing was to be under|taken, <Q>&startq;that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ent with them, and march in the head of their Army; and de&s;ired that adverti&s;ement, and order, <MILESTONE N="20"> might be &s;ent to that purpo&s;e to the Queen, and the Prince, at <HI>Paris;</HI> that &s;o his Highne&s;s might be ready for the Voyage, a&s;&s;oon as they&endq; &s;hould be prepared to receive him.</Q> The King would by no means con|&s;ent that the Prince &s;hould go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> being too well acquainted with the manners and fidelity of that Party there; but he was contented, that when they &s;hould have enter'd <HI>England</HI> with their Army, then the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould put him&s;elf in the head of them. <Q>They demanded, &startq;that &s;uch a Number of <HI>Scots-</HI>men &s;hould be allways in the Court, of the Bed-Chamber, and all other places about the Per&s;ons of the King, and Prince, and Duke of <HI>York:</HI> that <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> &s;hould be put into&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> the hands of the <HI>Scots;</HI></Q> and &s;ome other conce&s;&s;ions with reference to the Northern Counties; which trenched &s;o far upon the Honour and In|tere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that his Maje&s;ty utterly refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to it; and &s;o the Agreement was not concluded when the King left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court. But, a&s;&s;oon as he was at the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners re|paired to him, at the &s;ame time with tho&s;e who were &s;ent to him from the Parliament for his Royal A&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e four Bills &s;poken of before; then, in that &s;ea&s;on of de&s;pair, they prevailed with him to Sign the Propo&s;i|tions <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which Treaty was renew'd; and He Sign'd it at the I&s;le of</HI> Wight.</NOTE> he had formerly refu&s;ed; and, having great apprehen&s;ion from the Jealou&s;ies they knew the Army had of them, that they &s;hould be &s;ei&s;ed <MILESTONE N="40"> upon, and &s;earched in their return to <HI>London,</HI> they made up their pre|cious Contract in Lead, and buried it in a Garden in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> from whence they ea&s;ily found means afterwards to receive it. So con|&s;tant were tho&s;e Men to their Principles, and &s;o wary to be &s;ure to be no lo&s;ers by returning to their Allegiance; to which neither Con&s;cience nor Honour did invite or di&s;po&s;e them. So after a &s;tay of &s;ome Months at <HI>London</HI> to adju&s;t all Accounts, and receive the remainder of tho&s;e Monies they had &s;o dearly earned, or &s;o much of it as they had hope would be paid, they return'd to <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the hatred and contempt of the Army, and the Parliament, that was then govern'd by it; but <MILESTONE N="50"> with the veneration of the Presbyterian Party, which &s;till had &s;aith in them, and exceedingly depended upon their future Negotiation; which was now incumbent upon them: and in order thereunto, a fa&s;t inter|cour&s;e

<P>IT can never be enough wonder'd at that the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Presbyterians, being a watchful and crafty People, the principal of whom were as un|re&s;train'd by Con&s;cience as any of the Officers of the Army were, and only intended their particular advantage and ambition, &s;hould yet hope to carry on their Intere&s;t by &s;uch conditions, and limitations, as all wi&s;e Men &s;aw mu&s;t ab&s;olutely ruin and de&s;troy it. They knew well enough the Spirit of their own People, and that though it would be no hard <MILESTONE N="10"> matter to draw a numerous Army enough together, yet that being to|gether it would be able to do very little towards any vigorous attempt; and therefore their chief dependence was upon the A&s;&s;i&s;tance they &s;hould find ready to joyn with them in <HI>England.</HI> It is true, they did believe the Body of the Presbyterians in <HI>England</HI> to be much more con&s;iderable than in truth it was; yet they did, or might have known, that the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Per&s;ons who in the conte&s;t with the other Faction were content to be thought Presbyterians, were &s;o only as they thought it might re&s;tore the King; which they more impatiently de&s;ired, than any alteration in the Government of the Church; and that they did heartily intend a con|junction <MILESTONE N="20"> with all the Royal Party, upon who&s;e Intere&s;t, Conduct, and Courage, they did more rely than upon the power of the <HI>Scots;</HI> who did publickly profe&s;s that all the King's Friends &s;hould be mo&s;t welcome, and receiv'd by them; nor did they tru&s;t any one Presbyterian in <HI>England</HI> with the knowledge of the Particulars contain'd in the Agreement with the King; but concealed it between the three Per&s;ons who tran&s;acted it; and if it had been known, <HI>Cromwell</HI> might as ea&s;ily have overrun the Country before their Army invaded <HI>England,</HI> as he did afterwards; nor would one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man have joyn'd with them. Be&s;ides the infamous circum&s;tances by which they extorted Conce&s;&s;ions from the King, which <MILESTONE N="30"> would have render'd any Contract odious (it being made in tho&s;e four days, which were all that were a&s;&s;ign'd both to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;o that his Maje&s;ty had not only no time to advi&s;e with others, but could not advi&s;e with Him&s;elf upon &s;o many mon&s;trous par|ticulars as were demanded of him by both Kingdoms; which if he could have done, he would no more Then have &s;ubmitted to them, than he did afterwards upon long deliberation, and when his life appear'd to be in more manife&s;t danger by his refu&s;al) the particulars them&s;elves were the mo&s;t &s;candalous, and derogatory to the honour and intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; and would have been abominated, if known and under&s;tood, by <MILESTONE N="40"> all Men, with all po&s;&s;ible indignation.</P>

<P>IN the &s;econd place, the Presbyterians, by whom I mean the <HI>Scots,</HI> form'd all their coun&s;els by the Inclinations, and Affections of the People; and fir&s;t con&s;ider'd how they might corrupt, and &s;educe, and di&s;po&s;e them to &s;econd their purpo&s;es; and how far they might depend upon their con|currence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, before they re&s;olv'd to make any attempt; and this made them in &s;uch a degree &s;ubmit to their &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and wretched Clergy; who&s;e infectious breath corrupted, and govern'd the People, and who&s;e Authority was prevalent upon their own Wives, and in their do|me&s;tick affairs; and yet they never communicated to them more than <MILESTONE N="20"> the out&s;ide of their de&s;igns: Whereas, on the other &s;ide, <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the few others with whom he con&s;ulted, fir&s;t con&s;ider'd what was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to their main and determin'd end; and then, whether it were right or wrong, to make all other means &s;ub&s;ervient to it; to couzen and deceive Men, as long as they could induce them to contribute to what they de&s;ired, upon motives how forreign &s;oever; and when they would keep company with them no longer, or farther &s;erve their pur|po&s;es, to compel them by force to &s;ubmit to what they &s;hould not be able to oppo&s;e; and &s;o the one re&s;olv'd, only to do what they believ'd the Peo|ple would like and approve; and the other, that the People &s;hould like <MILESTONE N="30"> and approve what they had re&s;olv'd.

<P>CROMWELL, though the greate&s;t Di&s;&s;embler living, allways made his Hypocri&s;y of &s;ingular u&s;e and benefit to him; and never did any thing, how ungracious or imprudent &s;oever it &s;eem'd to be, but what was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the de&s;ign; even his roughne&s;s and unpoli&s;hedne&s;s, which, in the beginning of the Parliament, he affected contrary to the &s;moothne&s;s, and complacency, which his Cou&s;in, and bo&s;om Friend, M^r <HI>Hambden</HI> practiced towards all Men, was nece&s;&s;ary; and his fir&s;t publick Declara|tion, in the beginning of the War, to his Troop when it was fir&s;t mu&s;ter'd, <MILESTONE N="10"> <Q>&startq;that he would not deceive or couzen them by the perplexed and involv'd&endq; expre&s;&s;ions in his Commi&s;&s;ion, to fight for King and Parliament;</Q> and therefore told them, <Q>&startq;that if the King chanced to be in the Body of the Enemy that he was to charge, he would a&s;&s;oon di&s;charge his Pi&s;tol upon Him, as any other private Per&s;on; and if their con&s;cience would not permit them to do the like, he advi&s;ed them not to li&s;t them&s;elves in his&endq; Troop, or under his Command;</Q> which was generally looked upon as imprudent, and malitious, and might, by the profe&s;&s;ions the Parliament then made, have prov'd dangerous to him; yet &s;erv'd his turn, and &s;ever'd <MILESTONE N="20"> from others, and united among them&s;elves, all the furious, and incen&s;ed Men again&s;t the Government, whether Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil, to look upon him as a Man for their turn, upon whom they might depend, as one who would go through his work that he undertook. And his &s;trict and un&s;ociable humour in not keeping company with the other Officers of the Army in their jollities, and exce&s;&s;es, to which mo&s;t of the &s;uperior Officers under the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> were inclined, and by which he often made him&s;elf ridiculous or contemptible, drew all tho&s;e of the like &s;our or re&s;erv'd Natures, to his &s;ociety and conver&s;ation, and gave him oppor|tunity to form their Under&s;tandings, Inclinations, and Re&s;olutions, to his <MILESTONE N="30"> own Model. By this he grew to have a wonderful Intere&s;t in the Com|mon Soldiers, out of which, as his Authority increa&s;ed, he made all his Officers, well in&s;tructed how to live in the &s;ame manner with their Sol|diers, that they might be able to apply them to their own purpo&s;es: whil&s;t he looked upon the Presbyterian humour as the be&s;t incentive to Rebel|lion, no Man more a Presbyterian; he &s;ung all P&s;alms with them to their tunes, and lov'd the longe&s;t Sermons as much as they; but when he di&s;|cover'd that they would pre&s;cribe &s;ome limits and bounds to their Re|bellion, that it was not well breathed, and would expire a&s;&s;oon as &s;ome few particulars were granted to them in Religion, which he cared not for; <MILESTONE N="40"> and then that the Government mu&s;t run &s;till in the &s;ame Channel; it con|cern'd him to make it believ'd <Q>&startq;that the State had been more delinquent than the Church, and that the People &s;uffer'd more by the Civil than by the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical power; and therefore that the Change of one, would give them little ea&s;e, if there were not as great an alteration in the other,&endq; and if the whole Government in both were not reform'd, and alter'd;</Q> which though it made him generally odious at fir&s;t, and irreconciled ma|ny of his old Friends to him, yet it made tho&s;e who remain'd, more cor|dial, and firm: he could better compute his own &s;trength, and upon whom he might depend. This di&s;covery made him contrive the new Model of <MILESTONE N="50"> the Army; which was the mo&s;t unpopular Act, and di&s;obliged all tho&s;e who fir&s;t contrived the Rebellion, and who were the very Soul of it; and yet, if he had not brought that to pa&s;s, and changed a General, who,
<PB N="85" REF="1090">
though not very &s;harp &s;ighted, would never be govern'd, nor applied to any thing he did not like, for another who had no Eyes, and &s;o would be willing to be led, all his de&s;igns mu&s;t have come to nothing, and He re|main'd a private Colonel of Hor&s;e, not con&s;iderable enough to be in any figure upon an advantageous Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>AFTER all the Succe&s;&s;es of his new Model, he &s;aw his Army was bal|lanced by that of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who took them&s;elves to have equal merit with the other, and was thought to have contributed no le&s;s towards the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of the King, than that under <HI>Fairfax</HI> had done; and after all the Victories, and reduction of the King to that lowne&s;s, de&s;ired &s;till a com|po&s;ition, <MILESTONE N="10"> and to &s;ubmit again to the Subjection of the King; nor was it yet time for him to own or communicate his re&s;olution to the contrary, le&s;t even many of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed the extirpation of Monarchy, might be &s;tartled at the difficulty of the Enterpri&s;e, and with the Power that was like to oppo&s;e them. <Q>He was therefore fir&s;t to incen&s;e the People again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, &startq;as being a mercenary aid, entertain'd at a va&s;t Charge to the Kingdom, that was only to be paid their Wages, and to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, without having the honour to judge with them upon what conditions the King &s;hould be receiv'd, and re&s;tored; the accompli&s;h|ing whereof, ought to be the particular Glory of the Parliament with|out&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> a Rival, and that the King might owe the benefit wholely to Them.</Q> And this was as popular an Argument as he could embark him&s;elf in, the whole Kingdom in general having at that time a great dete&s;tation of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and they who mo&s;t de&s;ired the King's Re&s;toration, wi&s;h'd that he might have as little obligation to them as was po&s;&s;ible, and that they might have as little credit afterwards with him. With this univer&s;al Ap|plau&s;e, he compelled the <HI>Scots</HI> Army to depart the Kingdom, with that circum&s;tance as mu&s;t ever after render them odious and infamous. There now &s;eem'd nothing more dangerous and de&s;tructive to the power and intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, in &s;o general a di&s;content throughout the <MILESTONE N="30"> Kingdom, than a divi&s;ion, and mutiny within it &s;elf; that the Common Soldiers &s;hould erect an Authority di&s;tinct from their Officers, by which they would choo&s;e to govern again&s;t their Superior Commanders, at lea&s;t without them, and to fancy that they had an Intere&s;t of their own &s;ever'd from theirs, for the pre&s;ervation whereof they were to tru&s;t none but them&s;elves; which had &s;carce ever been heard of before in any Army, and was looked upon as a pre&s;age of the ruin of the whole, and of tho&s;e who had adhered to them; yet, if he had not rai&s;ed this &s;editious Spirit in the Army, he could not have prevented the disbanding &s;ome part of it, and &s;ending another part of it into <HI>Ireland,</HI> before the <HI>Scots</HI> left <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> nor have been able to have taken the King from <HI>Holmby</HI> into the hands of the Army, after the <HI>Scots</HI> were gone. And after all his hypo|cri&s;y towards the King and his Party, by which he prevented many in|conveniencies which might have befallen him, he could never have been rid of him again &s;o unreproachfully, as by his changing his own counte|nance, and giving cau&s;e to the King to &s;u&s;pect the &s;afety of his Per&s;on, and thereupon to make his E&s;cape from the Army; by which his Maje&s;ty quickly became a Pri&s;oner, and &s;o was deprived of any re&s;ort, from whence many mi&s;chiefs might have proceeded to have di&s;turbed his Coun&s;els. How con&s;tantly he pur&s;ued this method in his &s;ub&s;equent <MILESTONE N="50"> Actions, will be ob&s;erv'd in its place.</P>
<P>CONTRARY to this the Presbyterian <HI>Scots</HI> proceeded, in all their Actions after their fir&s;t inva&s;ion in the year 1640, and allways interwove

&s;ome conditions in their Coun&s;els and Tran&s;actions, which did not only prove, but, in the in&s;tant, might have been di&s;cern'd to be diametrically oppo&s;ite to their publick intere&s;t, and to their particular de&s;igns. It is very true, that their fir&s;t Inva&s;ion, &s;aving their breach of Allegiance, might have &s;ome excu&s;e from their Intere&s;t. They were a poor People, and though many particular Men of that Nation had receiv'd great Boun|ties, and were exceedingly enriched in the Court of <HI>England</HI> by King <HI>James</HI> and the pre&s;ent King, yet tho&s;e particular Men who had been, and then were in the Court, were, for the mo&s;t part, Per&s;ons of little In|tere&s;t in <HI>Scotland;</HI> nor was that Kingdom at all enriched by the con|junction <MILESTONE N="10"> with this; and they thought them&s;elves expo&s;ed to &s;ome late pre&s;&s;ures, which were new to them, and which their Preachers told them <Q>&startq;&endq;were again&s;t Con&s;cience, and an Inva&s;ion of their Religion;</Q> from which they had vindicated them&s;elves &s;o rudely, and unwarrantably, that they might well expect to be called to an account hereafter, if tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom they had mo&s;t provoked, retain'd their intere&s;t &s;till with the King, and in his Councils; from whom they were promi&s;ed to be &s;ecured, and to be well paid for their pains, if they would, by marching into <HI>England</HI> with an Army, give their Friends their countenance to own their own grievances, and &s;o to procure relief and &s;ecurity for both Kingdoms. In <MILESTONE N="20"> this enterpri&s;e, the &s;ucce&s;s crown'd their work; they were thought a wi&s;e, and a re&s;olute Nation; and after an unbloody War of above a year, they return'd into their Country laden with Spoiles and great Riches; and were liberally rewarded, as well for going out, as for coming into <HI>England.</HI> But from their return from this Expedition, their whole true Intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in, and depended upon, an entire adhering to the King, and vindicating his Honour and Intere&s;t from all A&s;&s;aults; and their being &s;uborn'd afterwards (when the King was in a hopeful way to have re|duced his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rebels to their obedience, by the &s;trength and power of his Armes) to make a &s;econd Inva&s;ion of the Kingdom, was a weak <MILESTONE N="30"> and childi&s;h Engagement, directly oppo&s;ite to their Intere&s;t, except they had at the &s;ame time a re&s;olution to have changed their own Govern|ment, and for ever to have renounced &s;ubjection to Monarchy (which was never in their purpo&s;e to do) or to withdraw it from the pre&s;ent King. Again, when his Maje&s;ty had tru&s;ted them &s;o far (which they had never rea&s;on to expect) as to put his Royal Per&s;on into their hands, and thereby given them an opportunity to redeem them&s;elves in the Eyes of the world, and to undo &s;ome part of the mi&s;chief they had done, it was &s;urely their Intere&s;t to have joyn'd cordially with him, and firmly to have united them&s;elves to his Party in vindication of the Law, and the Go|vernment <MILESTONE N="40"> e&s;tabli&s;hed; and if they had not had the Courage at that time to have looked the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army in the face, as apparently they had not, it had been their Intere&s;t to have retired with the King in the head of their Army into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and, leaving good Garri&s;ons in <HI>New-Ca&s;tle, Berwick,</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> all which were in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to have expected a revolution in <HI>England</HI> from the divi&s;ions among&s;t them&s;elves, and from &s;ome conjunction with a &s;trong Body of the King's <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Party, which would quickly have found them&s;elves together; but the delivery of the King up, be&s;ides the infamy of it, was, in view, de&s;tructive to all that could be thought their Intere&s;t. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>AFTER all this, when they found them&s;elves couzen'd and deceiv'd in all the mea&s;ures they had taken, and laughed at and de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e who had deceiv'd them, to have a new opportunity to &s;erve the King,
<PB N="87" REF="1070">
and then to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch conditions as mu&s;t make it impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;erve him effectually, was &s;uch a degree of weakne&s;s, and a de|prav'd under&s;tanding, that they can never be looked upon as Men who knew what their Intere&s;t was, or what was nece&s;&s;ary to advance their own de&s;igns. And yet we &s;hall be obliged to ob&s;erve how incorrigibly they adher'd to this ob&s;tinate and froward Method, in all the Tran&s;actions they afterwards had with the King; all which turn'd, as it could not but do, to their own ruin, and the de&s;truction of that Idol they adored, and paid their devotion to. But it is time to return to our di&s;cour&s;e, from whence this tedious digre&s;&s;ion hath mi&s;led us. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>ALL de&s;igns and Negotiations, abroad and at home, being in this &s;tate <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's condition in the I&s;le of</HI> Wight <HI>at this time</HI></NOTE> and condition, the King remain'd under a &s;trict, and di&s;con&s;olate impri|&s;onment, no Man being &s;uffer'd to &s;peak with him, and all diligence u&s;ed to intercept all Letters which might pa&s;s to, or from him; yet he found means &s;ometimes, by the affection and fidelity of &s;ome Inhabitants of the I&s;land, to receive important adverti&s;ements from his Friends; and to write to and receive Letters from the Queen; and &s;o he inform'd her of the <HI>Scots</HI> Tran&s;action, and of all the other hopes he had; and &s;eem'd to have &s;ome ea&s;e; and looked upon it as a good Omen, that in that de&s;perate lowne&s;s of his Fortune, and notwith&s;tanding all the care that was taken <MILESTONE N="20"> that none &s;hould be about him but Men of inhuman tempers and natures, void of all reverence towards God and Man, his Maje&s;ties gracious di&s;|po&s;ition, and generous affability &s;till wrought upon &s;ome Soldier, or other Per&s;on placed about him, to undertake, and perform &s;ome Offices of tru&s;t, in conveying Papers to and from him. So great a force and influence had Natural duty; or &s;ome de&s;perate Men had &s;o much craft, and foreca&s;t, to lay out a little application that might bring advantage to them in &s;uch a change as they neither looked for, nor de&s;ired. But many who did un|dertake to perform tho&s;e Offices, did not make good what they pro|mi&s;ed; which made it plain, they were permitted to get credit, that <MILESTONE N="30"> they might the more u&s;efully betray.</P>
<P>IN the Parliament, there was no oppo&s;ition or contradiction in any <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre&s;ent condition of the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> thing relating to the Publick; but in all tho&s;e tran&s;actions which con|cern'd particular Per&s;ons, with reference to Rewards, Preferments, or matter of profit, Men were con&s;ider'd according to the Party they were of; every day tho&s;e receiv'd benefit who had appear'd mo&s;t to adhere to the Army; the notorious Presbyterians were removed from places of Profit and Authority; which vexed them; and well prepared and di&s;|po&s;ed them to be ready for revenge. But the Pulpit-Skirmi&s;hes were higher than ever; the Presbyterians, in Tho&s;e fields, lo&s;ing nothing of <MILESTONE N="40"> their Courage, having a notorious power in the City, notwith&s;tanding the emulation of the Independents, who were more Learned and Ra|tional; who, though they had not &s;o great Congregations of the Com|mon People, yet in&s;ected, and were followed by, the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial, and wealthy Citizens; and by others of better condition. To the&s;e Men <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Officers of the Army adhered, with bitterne&s;s again&s;t the other. But the Divinity of the time was not to be judged by the Preaching, and Congregations in Churches, which were now thought not to be the fit and proper places for Devotion and Religious A&s;&s;em|blies, where the Bi&s;hops had exerci&s;ed &s;uch illimited Tyranny, and which <MILESTONE N="50"> had been polluted by their Original Con&s;ecrations. Liberty of Con|&s;cience was now become the great Charter; and Men who were <HI>in&s;pired,</HI> Preached and Prayed, when, and where they would. <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf
<PB N="88" REF="1080">
was the greate&s;t Preacher; and mo&s;t of the Officers of the Army, and many Common Soldiers, &s;hew'd their <HI>gifts</HI> that way. Anabapti&s;ts grew very numerous, with whom the Independents concurr'd &s;o far as to joyn with them for the utter aboli&s;hing of Tithes, as of Judaical In&s;titution; which was now the patrimony of the Presbyterians, and therefore pro|&s;ecuted by one Party, and defended by the other, with equal pa&s;&s;ion, and Animo&s;ity. If any hone&s;t Man could have been at &s;o much ea&s;e as to have beheld the pro&s;pect with delight, never was &s;uch a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, as at this time had &s;pread it &s;elf over the face of the whole Kingdom. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>DURING all this time, the Prince remain'd at <HI>Paris</HI> under the Go|vernment <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince's condition at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> of his Mother, exerci&s;ed with that &s;trictne&s;s, that though his Highne&s;s was above the Age of &s;eventeen years, it was not de&s;ired that he &s;hould meddle in any bu&s;ine&s;s, or be &s;en&s;ible of the unhappy condi|tion the Royal Family was in. The A&s;&s;ignation which was made by the Court of <HI>France</HI> for the better &s;upport of the Prince, was annexed to the Monthly allowance given to the Queen, and receiv'd by Her, and di&s;tributed as &s;he thought fit; &s;uch Clothes and other nece&s;&s;aries pro|vided for his Highne&s;s as were thought convenient; her Maje&s;ty de&s;iring to have it thought that the Prince lived entirely upon Her, and that it <MILESTONE N="20"> would not con&s;i&s;t with the dignity of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to be a Pen|&s;ioner to the King of <HI>France.</HI> Hereby none of his Highne&s;s's Servants had any pretence to ask Money, but they were to be contented with what &s;hould be allow'd to them; which was di&s;pen&s;ed with a very &s;paring hand; nor was the Prince him&s;elf ever Ma&s;ter of ten Pi&s;tols to di&s;po&s;e as he de&s;ired. The Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> was the Queen's chief Officer, and govern'd all her receipts, and he lov'd plenty &s;o well, that he would not be without it, whatever others &s;uffer'd. All who had any relation to the Prince, were to implore His aid; and the Prince him&s;elf could obtain nothing but by Him; which made mo&s;t Per&s;ons of Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion <MILESTONE N="30"> who were driven into bani&s;hment, as many of the Nobility and chief Gentry of the Kingdom then were, choo&s;e rather to make their re|&s;idence in any other place, as <HI>Caen, Roan,</HI> and the like, than in <HI>Paris,</HI> where the Prince was, and could do &s;o little: nor was this Oeconomy well liked even in <HI>France,</HI> nor the Prince him&s;elf &s;o much re&s;pected as he would have been if he had liv'd more like him&s;elf, and appear'd more concern'd in his own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> came thither, he was receiv'd very graciou&s;ly by the Queen, and con&s;ulted with in all things, being the Per&s;on mo&s;t depended upon to begin to give a turn to their fortune, re|commended <MILESTONE N="40"> to them by the King, and of the mo&s;t univer&s;al reputation of any Subject the King had. He pre&s;&s;ed a &s;peedy di&s;patch, that he might pur&s;ue his de&s;igns in <HI>Ireland;</HI> where he longed to be, whil&s;t the Affairs of that Kingdom were no more taken to heart by the Parlia|ment, who had yet &s;ent no &s;upplies thither. He inform'd the Queen, and the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> of the nece&s;&s;ity of ha&s;tning that work, which they under&s;tood well enough by the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners; who had been there, and had been &s;ent back with a million of promi&s;es, a coyn that Court allways abounded with, and made mo&s;t of its payments in.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen, who was as zealous for the di&s;patch as was po&s;&s;i|ble, <MILESTONE N="50"> pre&s;&s;ed the Queen Regent, and the Cardinal, upon it, &s;he receiv'd in words all the &s;atisfaction imaginable, and a&s;&s;urance that all things &s;hould be &s;peedily provided; and when the Marquis &s;poke fir&s;t with
<PB N="89" REF="1110">
the Cardinal upon the Subject, he found him well di&s;po&s;ed; making &s;uch ample promi&s;es for a very good Sum of Money, and &s;uch a Propor|tion of Armes, and Ammunition, as could be wi&s;hed. So that he thought he had no more to do, but to appoint the place for his embrakation, that tho&s;e provi&s;ions might be &s;ent thither to meet him; and that he &s;hould be ready to tran&s;port him&s;elf within a very &s;hort time; of which he gave notice to tho&s;e who expected him in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and prepared all his own Accommodations accordingly. But he was very much di&s;ap|pointed in his expectation; the Cardinal was not &s;o confident of the re|covery of the King's Affairs as to di&s;oblige the Parliament by contri|buting <MILESTONE N="10"> towards it: &s;o that Affair advanced very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>HAVING now, contrary to the order formerly ob&s;erv'd by me, crowded in all the particular pa&s;&s;ages, and important Tran&s;actions of two whole years into this Book, that I might not interrupt, or di&s;con|tinue the relation of the my&s;terious Proceedings of the Army, their great Hypocri&s;y, and Di&s;&s;imulation, practiced towards the King and his Party, and then their pulling off their Mask, and appearing in their na|tural dre&s;s of inhumanity and &s;avagene&s;s, with the vile Artifices of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners to draw the King into their hands, and then their low and ba&s;e compliance, and gro&s;s folly, in delivering him up, and la&s;tly <MILESTONE N="20"> their ab&s;urd and merchandly trafficking with him for the price of re|turning to their Allegiance, when there was no other way of pre&s;erving them&s;elves, and their Nation from being de&s;troyed, the many woeful Tragedies of the next year, which filled the world with amazement and horrour, mu&s;t be the Subject of the di&s;cour&s;e in the next Book.</P>

In <HI>England</HI> there was a general di&s;content among&s;t all &s;orts of Men; many Officers and Soldiers who had &s;erv'd the Parliament from the beginning of the War, and given too great Te&s;timonies of their courage and fidelity to their Party, and had been disbanded upon the new Model, looked upon the pre&s;ent Army with hatred, as tho&s;e who reaped the harve&s;t and re|ward of Their labours, and &s;pake of them and again&s;t them in all places accordingly: The Nobility and Gentry who had advanced the credit and reputation of the Parliament by concurring with it again&s;t the King, &s;ound them&s;elves totally neglected, and the mo&s;t inferior People pre|ferr'd <MILESTONE N="20"> to all places of tru&s;t and profit: The Presbyterian Mini&s;ters talked very loud; their Party appear'd to be very numerous, and the expecta|tion

of an attempt from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the importunity and clamour from <HI>Ireland,</HI> for &s;upplies of Men and Money again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who grew powerful, rai&s;ed the Courage of all di&s;contented Per&s;ons to meet and confer together, and all to inveigh again&s;t the Army, and the Of|ficers who corrupted it. The Parliament bore no reproach &s;o con|cernedly, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Ireland <HI>during the Lord</HI> Li&s;le<HI>'s being there.</HI></NOTE> as that of <Q>&startq;the want of &s;upplies to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that, having &s;o great an Army without an Enemy, they would not &s;pare any part&endq; of it to pre&s;erve that Kingdom.</Q> This Argument made a new warmth in the Hou&s;e of Commons, they who had been &s;ilent, and given over in&s;i&s;ting upon the in&s;olence and pre&s;umption of the Army, which had <MILESTONE N="10"> prevailed, and cru&s;hed them, took now new Spirit, and pre&s;&s;ed the re|lief of <HI>Ireland</HI> with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and in order thereunto made great inqui&s;ition into the Expences of the Money, and how &s;uch va&s;t Sums receiv'd had been disbur&s;ed; which was a large Field, and led them to many Mens doors upon whom they were willing to be re|venged.</P>
<P>THERE was a de&s;ign this way to get the Presbyterians again into power, and that they might get the Command of an Army for the &s;ub|duing the Rebels in <HI>Ireland. Cromwell</HI> had, for the quieting the Cla|mours from thence, got the Lord <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Earl of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> to be &s;ent under the Title of Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom thither, with a Commi&s;&s;ion for a limited time. He had landed in <HI>Mun|&s;ter,</HI> either out of the Jealou&s;y they had of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> or be|cau&s;e the be&s;t part of their Army of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were under his Command in that Province. But that Expedition gave the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> no relief, nor weaken'd the power or &s;trength of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> but rather increa&s;ed their reputation by the Faction and bitterne&s;s that was between the Lieute|nant and the Pre&s;ident, who writ Letters of complaint one again&s;t the other to the Parliament, where they had both their Parties which ad|hered to them. So that, the time of his Commi&s;&s;ion being expired, and <MILESTONE N="30"> the contrary Party not &s;uffering it to be renew'd, the Lord <HI>Li&s;le</HI> re|turn'd again into <HI>England,</HI> leaving the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> whom he meant to have de&s;troyed, in the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Command, and in greater reputation than he was before. And, in truth, he had pre&s;erv'd both with wonderful dexterity, expecting every day the Arrival of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and every day informing the Parliament of the ill condition he was in, and pre&s;&s;ing for a &s;upply of Men and Money, when he knew they would &s;end neither.</P>
<P>UPON the return of the Lord <HI>Li&s;le</HI> the Presbyterians renew'd their de&s;ign, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Waller <HI>nomi|nated General there, but op|po&s;ed by</HI> Cromwell; <HI>who propo&s;ed</HI> Lambert.</NOTE> and cau&s;ed S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> to be named for Deputy or Lieu|tenant <MILESTONE N="40"> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the rather (over and above his merit, and the expe|rience they had had of his Service) becau&s;e he could quickly draw to|gether tho&s;e Officers and Soldiers which had &s;erv'd under him, and were now disbanded, and would willingly again engage under their old Ge|neral. At the fir&s;t, <HI>Cromwell</HI> did not oppo&s;e this motion, but con&s;ented to it, being very willing to be rid both of <HI>Waller,</HI> and all the Officers who were willing to go with him; who he knew were not his Friends, and watched an opportunity to be even with him. But when he &s;aw <HI>Waller</HI> in&s;i&s;t upon great Supplies to carry with him, as he had rea&s;on to do, and when he con&s;ider'd of what con&s;equence it might be to him <MILESTONE N="50"> and all his de&s;igns, if a well form'd and di&s;ciplined Army &s;hould be un|der the power of <HI>Waller,</HI> and &s;uch Officers, he changed his mind; and fir&s;t &s;et his In&s;truments to cro&s;s &s;uch a &s;upply of Men and Money, as
<PB N="95" REF="1150">
he had propo&s;ed; <Q>&startq;the one, as more than nece&s;&s;ary for the Service, and&endq; the other as more than they could &s;pare from their other occa&s;ions: and when this check was put to <HI>Waller</HI>'s Engagement,</Q> he cau&s;ed <HI>Lam|bert</HI> to be propo&s;ed for that Expedition, a Man who was then fa&s;t to the &s;ame Intere&s;t He embraced, and who had gotten a great name in the Army. He formalized &s;o long upon this, that <HI>Ireland</HI> remain'd &s;till un|&s;upplied, and their Affairs there &s;eem'd to be in a very ill condition.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> made &s;o much noi&s;e of their purpo&s;es, even before their Commi&s;&s;ioners left <HI>London,</HI> and gave &s;uch con&s;tant adverti&s;ements of the impatience of their Country-men to be in Armes for the King, <MILESTONE N="10"> though they made no ha&s;t in providing for &s;uch an Expedition, that both the Presbyterians, who were their chief Corre&s;pondents, and the Royal Party, bethought them&s;elves how they might be ready; the one, that they might redeem them&s;elves from their former Guilt, and the other, that they might not only have a good part in freeing the King from his Impri&s;onment, but be able to pre&s;erve him in Liberty from any Presbyterian Impo&s;itions, which they &s;till apprehended the <HI>Scots</HI> might endeavour to oppo&s;e, though they had no &s;u&s;picion of the En|gagement lately mention'd at the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who had done twice very notoriou&s;ly ami&s;s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Holland <HI>pre|pares to ri&s;e with the Duke of</HI> Bucks <HI>and others.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> and had been, &s;ince his return from <HI>Oxford,</HI> notably de&s;pi&s;ed by all Per|&s;ons of credit in the Parliament and the Army, had a mind to redeem his former faults by a new and thorough Engagement. He had much credit by de&s;cent and by alliance with the Presbyterian Party, and was Privy to the undertakings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had con&s;tant Intelligence of the advance that was made there. His Brother, the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> had undergone &s;ome mortification with the re&s;t, and had not that Au|thotity in the Naval Affairs as he had u&s;ed to have, though he was the High Admiral of <HI>England</HI> by Ordinance of Parliament, and had done them extraordinary Services. He did not re&s;train, or endeavour to &s;up|pre&s;s <MILESTONE N="30"> the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI>'s di&s;contents, but inflamed them, and pro|mi&s;ed to joyn with him, as many others of that Gang of Men did; re|&s;olving that the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould not do all that work, but that they would have a &s;hare in the merit. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and his Brother, the Lord <HI>Francis Villiers,</HI> were newly return'd from travel, and though both very young, were &s;trong and active Men, and being, in re&s;pect of their Infancy, uningaged in the late War, and &s;o unhurt by it, and com|ing now to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of large E&s;tates, which they thought they were obliged to venture for the Crown upon the fir&s;t opportunity, they fell ea&s;ily into the friend&s;hip of the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and were ready to <MILESTONE N="40"> embark them&s;elves in his adventure. The Earl had made tender of his re&s;olutions to his old Mi&s;tre&s;s the Queen at <HI>Paris,</HI> who was allways di&s;po&s;ed to tru&s;t him, and the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> and He renewed their for|mer friend&s;hip, the warmth whereof had never been extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>So a Commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent from the Prince to the Earl to be General of an Army, that was to be rai&s;ed for the redemption of the King from Pri&s;on, and to re&s;tore the Parliament to its freedom. The Earl of <HI>Pe|terborough,</HI> and <HI>John Mordaunt</HI> his Brother, the Family of the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> and all the Officers who had &s;erv'd the King in the War, with which the City of <HI>London,</HI> and all Parts of the Kingdom abounded, <MILESTONE N="50"> applied them&s;elves to the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and receiv'd Commi&s;&s;ions from him for &s;everal Commands.</P>
<P>THIS Engagement was &s;o well known, and &s;o generally &s;poken of
<PB N="96" REF="1160">
that they concluded that the Parliament dur&s;t not take notice of it, or wi&s;hed well to it. And there is no que&s;tion, never undertaking of that nature was carried on with &s;o little re&s;ervation; there was &s;carce a Coun|ty in <HI>England,</HI> in which there was not &s;ome A&s;&s;ociation enter'd into to appear in Armes for the King. They who had the principal Command in <HI>Wales</HI> under the Parliament, &s;ent to <HI>Paris</HI> to declare, <Q>&startq;that, if they might have &s;upply of Armes and Ammunition, and a rea&s;onable Sum for the payment of their Garri&s;ons, they would declare for the King,&endq; having the chief places of tho&s;e parts in their Cu&s;tody.</Q> The Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> encouraged all tho&s;e Overtures with mo&s;t po&s;itive undertaking, <MILESTONE N="10"> that they &s;hould be &s;upplied with all they expected, within &s;o many days after they &s;hould declare; which they depended upon, and he, ac|cording to his cu&s;tom, never thought of after; by which the Service mi&s;carried, and many Gallant Men were lo&s;t.</P>
<P>CROMWELL, to whom all the&s;e Machinations were known, cho&s;e rather to run the hazard of all that &s;uch a loo&s;e Combination could pro|duce, than, by &s;ei&s;ing upon Per&s;ons, to engage the Parliament in Exa|minations, and in parties; the inconvenience whereof he apprehended more; finding already that the Presbyterian Party had &s;o great an in|fluence upon the General, that he declared to him, <Q>&startq;he would not&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> march again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> whom he had a good mind to have vi&s;ited be|fore their coun&s;els and Re&s;olutions were form'd;</Q> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> had rea&s;on to believe, that <HI>Fairfax</HI> would be firm to the &s;ame mind, even after they &s;hould have invaded the Kingdom.</P>
<P>ALL things being in this forwardne&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> it is fit to enquire <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>pre|parations for an Expedition into</HI> England.</NOTE> how the <HI>Scots</HI> complied with their obligations, and what expedition they u&s;ed in rai&s;ing their Army. After the Commi&s;&s;ioners return from <HI>London,</HI> upon the King's being made Pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> it was long before the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> could be prevailed with to con|&s;ent that a Parliament &s;hould be called. He had made a fa&s;t friend&s;hip <MILESTONE N="30"> with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Vane;</HI> and knew that in this new &s;tipulation with the King, the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction was the great Undertaker, and meant to have all the Honour of what&s;oever &s;hould follow. And yet the Duke upon his return to <HI>Scotland</HI> liv'd at fir&s;t very privately at his own Hou&s;e; &s;eldom went abroad to any meeting; and to tho&s;e who came to him, and to whom that re&s;olution would be grateful, he u&s;ed to &s;peak darkly, and as a Man that thought more of revenge upon tho&s;e who had impri&s;on'd him, than of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Crown to recover the Autho|rity it had lo&s;t. <HI>Argyle,</HI> who&s;e power was over that violent Party of the Clergy which would not depart from the mo&s;t rigid clau&s;e in the <MILESTONE N="40"> Covenant, and were without any reverence for the King or his Govern|ment, di&s;cern'd that he &s;hould never be able to hinder the calling of a Parliament, which the People generally called for, and that he &s;hould &s;ooner obtain his end by puzling their proceedings, and ob&s;tructing their determinations, after they &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled, than by ob&s;tinately oppo&s;ing their coming together. So Summons were i&s;&s;ued for the con|vention of a Parliament; and they who appear'd mo&s;t concern'd for the King, and to &s;et him at Liberty from his Impri&s;onment (which was all they pretended) were the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> Brother to Duke <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> and then re&s;tored to his Office of Secretary of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="50"> had been impri&s;on'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and made his e&s;cape from thence; and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who had been with the forwarde&s;t from the beginning of the Rebellion, when he was &s;carce of Age, and pro|&s;ecuted

<P>THEY were both Men of great Parts and Indu&s;try, though they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chara|cters of</HI> Lan|rick <HI>and</HI> Lau|therdale</NOTE> lov'd plea&s;ures too; both proud and ambitious; the Former, much the civiller and better bred, of the better Nature, and better Judgement, and an openne&s;s and clearne&s;s more to be tru&s;ted and relied upon than mo&s;t Men of that Party: the Latter, in&s;olent, imperious, flattering, and di&s;&s;embling, fitter for Intrigues and Contrivances by the want of the ingenuity which the other had, and by the experience and practice he had in the Committee of both Kingdoms in their darke&s;t de&s;igns. The Former, was a Man of Honour and Courage; the Latter, had <MILESTONE N="10"> Courage enough not to fail where it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and no impediment of Honour to re&s;train him from doing any thing that might gratify any of his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THESE two were the chief Managers and Contrivers to carry on this Affair, for though the Chancellor, the Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> had been a Commi&s;&s;ioner in <HI>England,</HI> and as privy to the Treaty with the King, and had made as many profe&s;&s;ions and prote&s;tations of duty to him as They, and indeed was willing to perform them, yet he was &s;o obnoxious for his loo&s;e and vitious life, which was notorious, that he dur&s;t not provoke <HI>Argyle</HI> or the Clergy by di&s;&s;enting from them. They u&s;ed all <MILESTONE N="20"> the Intere&s;t and Skill they had, to get &s;uch Elections in the Boroughs of Members for the Parliament as might comply with them; and the People generally were exceedingly offended, and a&s;hamed of the infa|mous delivery up of the King to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to which they imputed all the danger that threaten'd them, and the reproach and infamy that lay upon their Country; and &s;o had great prejudice to all Men who were thought to be the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>AT the opening of the Parliament, they did all they could to inflame <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment met in</HI> Scotland; <HI>and their Delibe|rations.</HI></NOTE> the People again&s;t the Army in <HI>England;</HI> <Q>which, they &s;aid, &startq;had forced the Parliament there to break the Treaty between the two Kingdoms <MILESTONE N="30"> in their ill u&s;age of the King, who was impri&s;on'd by the Army, nor was it in the power of the Parliament to &s;et him at liberty: That they had now, upon the matter, ab&s;olutely depo&s;ed him, by not &s;uffering him to perform the Office of a King, nor permitting any of his Sub|jects to repair to him; in which the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> was con|cern'd, in that being independent upon <HI>England,</HI> and the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> they were by them deprived of their King, and could not be admitted to &s;peak with him, nor his Maje&s;ty to &s;end to them; which was &s;uch a pre&s;umption, and violation of the Law of Nations, and &s;uch a perfidious breach and contempt of the &s;olemn League and <MILESTONE N="40"> Covenant, and of the Treaty between the two Kingdoms, that they were bound by all the obligations humane and divine to be &s;en&s;ible of it, and to redeem their King's liberty, and their own honour, with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes and all that was dear to them: and therefore they de&s;ired that they might enter upon tho&s;e Coun&s;els, which might &s;oone&s;t get an Army together, which &s;hould no &s;ooner enter <HI>England,</HI> but it would find a conjunction from that whole King|dom, except only the Army; and that it would then quickly appear that the Parliaments of both Kingdoms de&s;ired the &s;ame thing, and&endq; to live happily under the Government of the &s;ame King.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e, urged and &s;econded by many of the principal Men, was entertain'd by the re&s;t with &s;o general a reception, that <HI>Argyle</HI> &s;ound it would be to no purpo&s;e directly to contradict or oppo&s;e it.

He &s;aw the Election of the Knights and Burge&s;&s;es had &s;ucceeded ac|cording to the wi&s;hes of the other Lords, and that they would concur with what&s;oever was propo&s;ed; and he found likewi&s;e that they had wrought upon the greate&s;t part of their Clergy; who believ'd all they &s;aid to them.

Of this kind there were two very notable Men, S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave;</HI> both Men of large and plentiful E&s;tates, the one in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> the other <MILESTONE N="30"> in <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmoreland;</HI> who having been in the time of Peace eminent in their Country in the Offices of Ju&s;tices of Peace, and Deputy Lieutenants, had, in the beginning of the War, engaged them|&s;elves in Commands in the King's Army with great reputation of &s;tout, diligent, and active Officers; and continued to the end, and had not after applied them&s;elves to make any compo&s;ition, but expected a new opportunity to appear with their Swords in their hands. They were both looked upon by the Parliament, and the chief Officers of the Army, with great jealou&s;y, as Men worthy to be fear'd, and who could never be induced to comply with them. The <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords had not been &s;cru|pulous <MILESTONE N="40"> to let the&s;e two Gentlemen know what they intended, and <Q>&startq;that they made no que&s;tion but they &s;hould engage their whole Kingdom and Nation to enter into a pre&s;ent War with <HI>England</HI> on the King's behalf; and therefore de&s;ired them, by the Intere&s;t, and Influence they had upon the Northern Counties, to di&s;po&s;e them to a conjunction&endq; with them.</Q> And becau&s;e they knew that they two were too notorious to &s;tay with any Security about <HI>London,</HI> much le&s;s in their own Coun|try, they invited them into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they a&s;&s;ured them, <Q>&startq;they &s;hould not only be &s;afe, but very welcome; and &s;hould be Witne&s;&s;es of their Proceedings, and have parts of their own to act in, a&s;&s;oon as&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> the Sea&s;on &s;hould be ripe.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Gentlemen, though they had been hitherto unhurt, and whil&s;t the Army made tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions towards the King, had been

much courted by the chief Officers thereof, and had been Quarter'd with them as Friends, knew well, now the Mask was off, that if they did not immediately apply them&s;elves to make their compo&s;itions, they &s;hould be apprehended, and impri&s;oned. And therefore, being per&s;waded that the <HI>Scots</HI> would engage for the King, they accepted their Invitation, and told them, <Q>&startq;they &s;hould quickly find them in <HI>Scotland</HI> after their&endq; own return.</Q> Accordingly, after having &s;ecretly &s;pent &s;ome time in their own Countries, and directed their Friends to be in a readine&s;s when they &s;hould be called upon, and in the mean time &s;ettled a way how to corre&s;pond together, they went into <HI>Scotland</HI> to tho&s;e who had invited <MILESTONE N="10"> them, and were receiv'd by them with civility enough. They own'd &s;uch a warine&s;s, in re&s;pect of the jealou&s;ies among&s;t them&s;elves, and the ill Arts of <HI>Argyle,</HI> that they de&s;ired them <Q>&startq;for &s;ome time to withdraw&endq; to &s;ome place</Q> (which they recommended to them) <Q>&startq;and there to re|main in &s;ecret, and under feigned Names, until the calling of the Par|liament; at which time they might come to <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and ap|pear&endq; in their own likene&s;s with all freedom.</Q> So after having remain'd in that private manner, where they were well treated for &s;ome Months, when the Parliament was a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> they return'd thi|ther; and were very well looked upon by all that knew them; which <MILESTONE N="20"> made them behave them&s;elves with the more freedom and confidence in their conver&s;ation, the foremention'd Lords telling them all they meant to do, and what Arts they were to u&s;e till they could get their Army up, towards which they believ'd they had ma&s;ter'd the greate&s;t difficulties.</P>
<P>THOUGH the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners had withdrawn from <HI>London,</HI> &s;hortly after they had prote&s;ted loudly again&s;t the proceedings of the Parliament, both in impri&s;oning the King, and in refu&s;ing to give them leave to repair to him, or to receive from him any directions or orders concerning the Government of that Kingdom, and thought it high time <MILESTONE N="30"> to provide for their own &s;ecurity by quitting their Station at <HI>London,</HI> where they receiv'd every day Affronts, and their Per&s;ons were expo&s;ed to contempt; yet there were no &s;ooner Preparations towards a Parlia|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent from the two Hou&s;es into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> than Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent from the Lords and Commons at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to re&s;ide at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> as if they hoped to overvote them there too; and it was evident quickly that they were not without a &s;trong or at lea&s;t an active Party there. They were receiv'd with the &s;ame &s;hew of re&s;pect, and the &s;ame care was taken for their Accommodation, as had been when they fir&s;t came for contriving of the Covenant; not only the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and his Party, very dili|gently <MILESTONE N="40"> vi&s;ited them, and perform'd all offices of re&s;pect towards them, but even the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction, and they who were mo&s;t &s;ollicitous to rai&s;e the War, attended them as officiou&s;ly as others, and made the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ions to pre&s;erve the Peace and Amity between the two Nations.</P>
<P>THAT rigid Party of the Clergy which &s;o adored the Covenant in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the Letter, that they did not de&s;ire to have any more dependence upon the King, but in effect to lay him a&s;ide, and to &s;ettle the Government without him, as their Brethren in <HI>England</HI> had re&s;olv'd to do, were never from them, and willingly receiv'd &s;uch Pre&s;ents and <MILESTONE N="50"> Pen&s;ions from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, as they were prepared and provided to offer to them; and much Money was given to make them fa&s;t Friends.

<P>THE Prince's remove from <HI>Paris</HI> on &s;uch a &s;uddain, proceeded from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Revolt of part of the Fleet to the King from</HI> Rain&s;|borough.</NOTE> an Accident in <HI>England</HI> that was very extraordinary, and looked like a call from Heaven. The Parliament about this time had prepared, ac|cording to cu&s;tom, a good Fleet of ten or a dozen Ships for the Summer Guard, and appointed <HI>Rainsborough</HI> to be Admiral thereof; who had been bred at Sea, and was the Son of an eminent Commander at Sea lately dead; but he him&s;elf, from the time of the new Model, had been an Officer of Foot in the Army, and was a Colonel of &s;pecial note and account, and of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s chief confidents. This offended the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> much, and di&s;po&s;ed him to that inclination to concur with his Brother lately mention'd. Captain <HI>Batten</HI> likewi&s;e was as much un|&s;atisfied, <MILESTONE N="20"> who had acted a great part in the fir&s;t alienating the Fleet, and the Affections of the Seamen from the King, and had ever been their Vice-Admiral afterwards, and one of the Per&s;ons upon whom they prin|cipally relied at Sea. <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> as long as he remain'd in the Navy, had been under his Command, and both the Earl and <HI>Batten</HI> well knew that this Man was now made Admiral of this Fleet, becau&s;e they, be|ing Presbyterians, &s;hould have no credit or influence upon it; which made them &s;ollicitous enough that the Seamen &s;hould not be well plea&s;ed with the Alteration; and They looked upon <HI>Rainsborough</HI> as a Man that had for&s;aken them, and preferr'd the Land before the Sea Service. The <MILESTONE N="30"> Seamen are in a manner a Nation by them&s;elves, a humerous, brave, and &s;turdy People; fierce, and re&s;olute in what&s;oever they are inclined to, &s;omewhat un&s;teady and incon&s;tant in pur&s;uing it, and jealous of tho&s;e to morrow by whom they are govern'd to day. The&s;e Men, ob|&s;erving the general di&s;content of the People, and that, however the Par|liament was obeyed by the power of the Army, both Army and Parlia|ment were grown very odious to the Nation, and hearing &s;o much di&s;|cour&s;e of an Army from <HI>Scotland</HI> ready to enter into the Kingdom, concluded that the King would be re&s;tored; and then remembring that the revolt of the Fleet was the preamble to the lo&s;s of his Maje&s;ties Au|thority <MILESTONE N="40"> every where el&s;e, and a great cau&s;e of all his misfortunes, thought it would be a glorious thing to them, if they could lead the way to his Maje&s;ties Re&s;toration by their declaring for him. This was an Agitation among the Common Seamen, without communicating it to any Officer of the Quality of Ma&s;ter of a Ship. This inclination was much improv'd in them by a general di&s;po&s;ition in <HI>Kent</HI> to an In&s;urrection for the King, and by &s;ome Gentlemen's coming on board the Ships, according to the cu&s;tom of that Country; who fomented the good di&s;po&s;ition in the Sea|men by all the ways they could.</P>
<P>AT this very time there appear'd generally throughout <HI>Kent</HI> the &s;ame <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commotions in</HI> Kent <HI>for the King</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> indige&s;ted Affection to the King, and inclination to &s;erve him, as was among the Seamen, and was conducted with much le&s;s order and cau|tion, neither the one nor the other having been de&s;ign'd by tho&s;e who
<PB N="104" REF="1240">
took care of the King's Affairs, and who de&s;ign'd tho&s;e In&s;urrections which happen'd in other parts of the Kingdom. They knew nothing, that is, contributed nothing to this good di&s;po&s;ition in the Seamen, though they were not without &s;ome hope that, upon all other Revolu|tions, &s;omewhat might likewi&s;e fall out at Sea to the advantage of the King's Affairs. They had &s;ome expectation indeed from <HI>Kent,</HI> where they knew the People were generally well affected, and depended upon two or three Gentlemen of that Country, who had been Officers in the King's Army, and re&s;olv'd to bring in &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e, when oc|ca&s;ion &s;hould be ripe; but it was re&s;olv'd and intended that the <HI>Scots</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> Army &s;hould be enter'd the Kingdom, by which the Parliament Army would be upon their March towards them, before they would have any appearance of force in the parts near <HI>London;</HI> and then they believ'd that both Country and City would ri&s;e together. And &s;o tho&s;e Gentle|men of <HI>Kent,</HI> who were privy to any de&s;ign, lay privately in <HI>London</HI> to avoid all Cabals in their Country; &s;o that what now fell out there, was by meer chance and accident, that could never be fore&s;een, or pre|vented.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd to be at &s;ome jovial meeting in <HI>Kent</HI> about that time, one M^r <HI>L'E&s;trange</HI> a younger Brother of a good Family in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> who had been allways of the King's Party, and for attempting &s;omewhat in his own Country for his Maje&s;ties Service, had been taken Pri&s;oner by the Parliament, and by a Court of War condemn'd to dye, but be|ing kept in Pri&s;on till the end of the War, was then &s;et at Liberty, as one in whom there was no more danger. But he retain'd his old Af|fections, and more remember'd the cruel u&s;age he had receiv'd, than that they had not proceeded as cruelly with him as they might have done. He had a great Friend&s;hip with a young Gentleman, M^r <HI>Hales,</HI> who liv'd in <HI>Kent,</HI> and was Married to a Lady of a Noble Birth and Fortune, he being Heir to one of the greate&s;t Fortunes of that Country, <MILESTONE N="30"> but was to expect the Inheritance from the favour of an old &s;evere Grandfather, who for the pre&s;ent kept the young couple from running into any exce&s;s; the Mother of the Lady being of as &s;our and &s;trict a Nature as the Grandfather, and both of them &s;o much of the Parliament Party, that they were not willing any part of their E&s;tates &s;hould be hazarded for the King. At the Hou&s;e of this M^r <HI>Hales,</HI> M^r <HI>L'E&s;trange</HI> was, when by the communication which that part of <HI>Kent</HI> allways hath with the Ships which lye in the <HI>Downs,</HI> the report fir&s;t did ari&s;e that the Fleet would pre&s;ently declare for the King, and tho&s;e Seamen who came on Shore talked as if the City of <HI>London</HI> would joyn with them. <MILESTONE N="40"> This drew many Gentlemen of the Country who wi&s;hed well, to vi&s;it the Ships, and they return'd more confirm'd of the truth of what they had heard. Good fellow&s;hip was a Vice &s;pread every where, and this young great Heir, who had been allways bred among his Neighbours, affected that which they were be&s;t plea&s;ed with, and &s;o his Hou&s;e was a Rendezvous for tho&s;e who delighted in that Exerci&s;e, and who every day brought him the news of the good inclinations in the Fleet for the King; and all Men's Mouths were full of the general hatred the whole Kingdom had again&s;t the Parliament as well as the Army. M^r <HI>L'E&s;trange</HI> was a Man of a good Wit, and a fancy very luxuriant, and of an enter|pri&s;ing <MILESTONE N="50"> Nature. He ob&s;erv'd, by the good company that came to the Hou&s;e, that the Affections of all that large and populous Country were for the King. <Q>He begun to tell M^r <HI>Hales,</HI> &startq;that though his Grandfather
<PB N="105" REF="1250">
did in his heart wi&s;h the King well, yet his carriage had been &s;uch in his conjunction with the Parliament, that he had more need of the King's favour than of his Grandfather's to be Heir to that great E&s;tate; and that certainly nothing could be more acceptable to his Grandfa|ther,&endq; or more glorious to Him, than to be the In&s;trument of both;</Q> and therefore advi&s;ed him <Q>&startq;to put him&s;elf into the head of his own Country, which would be willing to be led by him, that when the <HI>Scots</HI> were enter'd into the Northern parts, and all the Kingdom &s;hould be in Armes, he might, with the Body of his Country-men, march towards <HI>London;</HI> which would induce both the City and the Parlia|ment <MILESTONE N="10"> to joyn with him, whereby he &s;hould have great &s;hare in the&endq; honour of Re&s;toring the King.</Q></P>
<P>THE Company that frequented the Hou&s;e thought the di&s;cour&s;e ve|ry rea&s;onable, and &s;aw that the i&s;&s;ue mu&s;t be very honourable: the young Lady of the Hou&s;e was full of Zeal for the King, and was willing her Husband &s;hould be the In&s;trument of his delivery: the young Gen|tleman him&s;elf had not been enough conver&s;ant in the Affairs of the world to apprehend the danger, or hazard of the Attempt, and &s;o re|ferr'd him&s;elf and the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s to be govern'd, and conducted by M^r <HI>L'E&s;trange,</HI> whom they all believ'd by his di&s;cour&s;e to be an able <MILESTONE N="20"> Soldier. He writ &s;ome Letters to particular Gentlemen, who he was inform'd would receive them willingly, and &s;ign'd Warrants to the Con|&s;tables of hundreds with his own Name, which had been never heard of in the Country, requiring, <Q>&startq;in his Maje&s;ties name, all Per&s;ons to appear, at a time and place appointed, to advi&s;e together, and to lay hold on &s;uch opportunities, as &s;hould be offer'd for relieving the King and de|livering&endq; him out of Pri&s;on.</Q> There was an incredible appearance of the Country at the place appointed, where M^r <HI>L'E&s;trange</HI> appear'd with M^r <HI>Hales,</HI> and tho&s;e Per&s;ons which had been u&s;ed to their Company. M^r <HI>L'E&s;trange</HI> &s;poke to them in a &s;tyle very much his own; and being <MILESTONE N="30"> not very clear to be under&s;tood, the more prevailed over them. He &s;pake like a Man in Authority, inveighed again&s;t <Q>&startq;the Tyranny of the Army, which had &s;ubdued the Parliament, again&s;t their barbarous im|pri&s;onment of the King, and again&s;t a con&s;piracy they had to murther&endq; him.</Q> He added <Q>&startq;that the Affections of that noble Country were well known to his Maje&s;ty, and that he had therefore appointed the Fleet that was in the <HI>Downs</HI> to joyn with them; and that he doubted not but they would together be too &s;trong for his Enemies, who were like to have enough to do to defend them&s;elves in many other places; and that his Maje&s;ty was willing they &s;hould have a Gentleman of their&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> own Country, well known to them, to be their General;</Q> and named M^r <HI>Hales;</HI> who was pre&s;ent. There was not one Man who &s;o much as asked for any Letter or Commi&s;&s;ion, or other Authority from the King; <Q>but all of them, very frankly and unanimou&s;ly, declared &startq;they would&endq; be ready to joyn, and march as their General <HI>Hales</HI> &s;hould direct;</Q> and &s;o another day and place was appointed for another appearance, and li&s;t|ing and forming their Regiments; and in the mean time M^r <HI>L'E&s;trange</HI> &s;et out &s;uch Declarations, and Engagements, as he thought mo&s;t like to prevail with the People, <Q>and required &startq;that they &s;hould be read in&endq; all Churches; which was done accordingly.</Q> The next appearance was <MILESTONE N="50"> greater than the former; and with the &s;ame forwardne&s;s, many coming Armed both Hor&s;e and Foot, and &s;hewing a marvellous alacrity to the Engagement. Their General then gave out his Commi&s;&s;ions for &s;everal
<PB N="106" REF="1260">
Regiments, and a new day was appointed for their Rendezvous, when all &s;hould come Armed, and keep together in a Body, until it &s;hould be fit to march to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>IT was known that the Fleet was gone out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> but it was as well known that it had ab&s;olutely renounced the Service of the Par|liament, and rejected all their Officers. It was ea&s;y to per&s;wade the Peo|ple, that they were gone upon &s;ome important Enterpri&s;e, and would &s;peedily return; and it was in&s;inuated, <Q>&startq;that it was gone to the I&s;le of&endq; <HI>Wight</HI> to relea&s;e the King, who would return with it into <HI>Kent;</HI></Q> which made them ha&s;ten their preparations. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>AT the time when the King made the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> Ad|miral, he declared, and it was in&s;erted in his Commi&s;&s;ion, <Q>&startq;that he&endq; &s;hould enjoy that Office during the Minority of the Duke of <HI>York;</HI></Q> and the Duke having made his E&s;cape at this time, when there was this Commotion among&s;t the Seamen, it was no &s;ooner known that his High|ne&s;s was in <HI>Holland,</HI> but the Seamen talked aloud <Q>&startq;that they would go&endq; to their Admiral;</Q> and the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> &s;tirring them up and in|flaming them to that re&s;olution, and the Seamen again pre&s;&s;ing the Gen|tlemen to ha&s;ten their ri&s;ing in Armes, that they might a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;e|cond each other, they both declared them&s;elves &s;ooner than they ought <MILESTONE N="20"> to have done, and before they were prepared for an Enterpri&s;e of that importance.</P>
<P>THE Parliament was well inform'd of the di&s;temper among&s;t the Sea|men, and had therefore forborne putting the half of the Provi&s;ions aboard the Ships, which, for the greate&s;t part, lay ready in the <HI>Downs,</HI> wanting only half the Victual they were to have for the Summer Ser|vice. But tho&s;e Officers which were on board, finding they had no Au|thority, and that the Seamen mocked and laughed at them, &s;ent every day to inform the Parliament, what mutinous humour the whole Fleet was in. Whereupon they &s;ent <HI>Rainsborough</HI> and &s;ome other Officers <MILESTONE N="30"> thither; pre&s;uming that the pre&s;ence of the Admiral would quickly quiet all. He, being a Man of a rough imperious Nature, a&s;&s;oon as he came on board his Ship, begun to make a &s;trict Enquiry into the for|mer di&s;orders and mutinous behaviour, upon which all the Men of his Ship retired into their old Fortre&s;s of One and All, and pre&s;ently laid hold on him, and put Him, and &s;uch other Officers of the Ship as they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rainsborough <HI>and &s;ome other Officers put on Shore by the Seamen.</HI></NOTE> liked not, into the Boat, and &s;ent them on Shore. Which was no &s;ooner known to the re&s;t of the Ships, but they followed their example, and u&s;ed Their Officers in the &s;ame manner. After they had for &s;ome days been fea&s;ted and care&s;&s;ed by the People of <HI>Kent,</HI> &s;ome of the Gentlemen <MILESTONE N="40"> putting them&s;elves on board to joyn with them, and in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t them towards providing &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as were wanting, they went out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> and &s;tood for <HI>Holland,</HI> that they might find their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The revolted Ships went over to</HI> Hol|land.</NOTE> Admiral; and let fall their Anchors before the <HI>Brill.</HI> What was done by the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> on Shore, and the &s;ucce&s;s thereof, will be related hereafter.</P>
<P>THIS &s;o very &s;ea&s;onable revolt of the Fleet, in a conjuncture when &s;o many Advantages were expected, was looked upon as a &s;ure Omen of the deliverance of the King. And the report that the Ships were be|fore <HI>Calais,</HI> as if they had expected &s;ome Body there, which was true, <MILESTONE N="50"> for &s;ome time, was the rea&s;on that it was thought fit that the Prince (who had hitherto thought of nothing but being &s;ent for by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and how to find him&s;elf with them) &s;hould make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to
<PB N="107" REF="1270">
<HI>Calais.</HI> This was the Cau&s;e of that his &s;uddain motion, which was yet retarded for want of Money, and all other things nece&s;&s;ary for his Jour|ney. The Cardinal &s;hewed no manner of favouring all the&s;e Appearances of Advantage to the King; he gave le&s;s countenance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> than he had ever done when it was in Rebellion again&s;t the King; and, not|with&s;tanding all his promi&s;es with reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> remain'd &s;till at <HI>Paris,</HI> without obtaining Armes or Money in any proportion (both which had been promi&s;ed &s;o liberally) and was, after all importunities, compelled to tran&s;port him&s;elf into <HI>Ireland</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>goes out of</HI> France <HI>into</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> (where he was &s;o importunately called for) without any manner of Sup|plies, <MILESTONE N="10"> which were expected. And now, when the remove of the Prince was &s;o behoveful, the Cardinal utterly refu&s;ed to furni&s;h him with any Money; all which di&s;countenances were &s;hortly after remember'd to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as high merit.</P>
<P>THE Prince's remove was by every Body thought &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> as was pretended, found means to borrow &s;o much Money as was nece&s;&s;ary for the Journey; which the King paid long af|ter with full Intere&s;t. D^r <HI>Goffe,</HI> a Man well known in that time, as the chief Agent and Confident of my Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> was pre&s;ently &s;ent into <HI>Holland,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e the Seamen to be willing to receive the Lord <HI>Jer|min</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> to Command the Fleet. So &s;ollicitous that Noble Man was to be in the head of any Action that was like to pro&s;per, how unfit &s;oever he was for it; having neither indu&s;try, nor knowledge of any thing of the Sea, and being le&s;s belov'd by the Seamen than any Man that could be named. The Prince made what ha&s;t he could to <HI>Calais,</HI> attended by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and &s;ome other Gentlemen, be&s;ides his own Dome&s;ticks; and finding one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigats before <HI>Calais,</HI> and under&s;tanding that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was gone from the <HI>Hague</HI> to <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> and had put him&s;elf on board the Fleet there, his Highne&s;s pre&s;ently embarked, and made the <MILESTONE N="30"> more ha&s;t le&s;t his Brother &s;hould be in Action before him, and was re|ceiv'd at the Fleet with all tho&s;e acclamations and noi&s;es of joy, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince is receiv'd at the Fleet.</NOTE> that People are accu&s;tom'd to; they having expre&s;&s;ed as much &s;ome days before, at the arrival of the Duke of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>ASSOON as it was known in <HI>Holland</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was arriv'd, the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with his Wife the Prince&s;s Royal, came pre&s;ently thither to entertain his Highne&s;s the be&s;t that place would permit, but e&s;pecially to rejoyce together, having not &s;een each other from the time they were Children. The Prince found the Fleet in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the Prince's Fleet.</NOTE> Faction and Di&s;order, and great pains had been taken to corrupt them. <MILESTONE N="40"> S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI>'s coming to the <HI>Hague</HI> to A&s;&s;ume the Government of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> had not been acceptable to his Royal Highne&s;s; who was per&s;waded by Colonel <HI>Bamfield,</HI> that he had been unfaithful, as well as unfortunate, in his attendance upon the King to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI> The Colonel him&s;elf was &s;o incen&s;ed with it, that he u&s;ed all the skill and in&s;inuation he had, to le&s;&s;en his Highne&s;s's reverence to the Queen, and to di&s;pute her Commands. Then taking the opportunity of the Fleet's being come to <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> he went thither, and having, as is &s;aid before, a wonderful Addre&s;s to the di&s;po&s;ing Men to mutiny, and to work upon Common Men, which the Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of, there being <MILESTONE N="50"> no Officers, for the mo&s;t part, above the quality of a Boat&s;waine or Ma&s;ter's Mate, he per&s;waded them <Q>&startq;to declare for the Duke of <HI>York,&endq;</HI> without any re&s;pect to the King or Prince;</Q> and when his Highne&s;s

&startq;&s;hould be on board, that they &s;hould not meddle in the quarrel be|tween the King and the Parliament, but entirely joyn with the Pre&s;|byterian Party, and the City of <HI>London;</HI> which by this means would&endq; bring the Parliament to rea&s;on:</Q> and he prepared his Friends the Sea|men when the Duke &s;hould come to them, that they would except again&s;t S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> and cau&s;e him to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and then he be|liev'd he &s;hould be able to govern both his Highne&s;s and the Fleet.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time D^r <HI>Goffe,</HI> who was a dextrous Man too, and could comply with all Men in all the Acts of good fellow&s;hip, had gotten ac|quaintance with others of the Seamen, and made them jealous of <HI>Bam|field</HI>'s <MILESTONE N="10"> activity; and endeavour'd to per&s;wade them <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould all Petition the Prince (who, he knew, would be &s;hortly with them) that the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> might be made their Admiral; who would be able to &s;upply them with Money, and what&s;oever el&s;e they wanted: that there was no hope of Money but from <HI>France,</HI> and that the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> had all the power and credit there, and might have what Mo|ney&endq; he de&s;ired;</Q> and by the&s;e Agitations, the infant Loyalty of the Seamen begun to be di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> who had allways adhered to the Presbyterians, and was of great e&s;teem among&s;t them, <MILESTONE N="20"> though he was not tainted with their principles, had left the Parlia|ment, and &s;ecretly tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>Holland;</HI> and was arrived at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> when <HI>Bamfield</HI> return'd from the Fleet, and went to wait upon the Duke of <HI>York</HI> at the <HI>Hague. Bamfield</HI> deliver'd &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age from the Fleet as he thought would ha&s;ten the Duke's Journey thither; and told him, <Q>&startq;the Seamen made great enquiry after the Lord&endq; <HI>Willoughby,</HI> and much longed to have him with them;</Q> in&s;inuating to the Duke, <Q>&startq;that he had much contributed to that good di&s;po&s;ition in the Seamen, and was privy to their revolt, and had promi&s;ed &s;peedi|ly to come to them, and that it would be the mo&s;t acceptable thing <MILESTONE N="30"> his Highne&s;s could do to carry him with him to the Fleet, and make&endq; him his Vice-Admiral.</Q> The Duke made all imaginable ha&s;t to <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> and immediately went on board the Admiral; where he was re|ceiv'd with the u&s;ual marks of joy and acclamation. He declared the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> his Vice-Admiral, and appointed &s;ome other Officers in the &s;everal Ships, and &s;eem'd very de&s;irous to be out at Sea. In the mean time <HI>Bamfield</HI> continued his Activity; and the Doctor, finding he had little hope to rai&s;e his Patron to the heigth he propo&s;ed, did all he could to hinder the Operation of <HI>Bamfield,</HI> and took all the ways he could that the Prince might be adverti&s;ed of it, and thereupon ha&s;ten <MILESTONE N="40"> his own Journey; which did likewi&s;e contribute to the ha&s;t his Highne&s;s made. He arriv'd at <HI>Helvoet Sluce</HI> very &s;ea&s;onably to prevent many in|conveniencies, which would have inevitably fallen out; and the Seamen, upon his Highne&s;s's appearance, return'd again into their old chearful humour; which the Prince knew would be be&s;t pre&s;erv'd by Action; and therefore exceedingly de&s;ired to be at Sea, where he was &s;ure he mu&s;t be Superior to any Force the Parliament could in a &s;hort time put out. But the Fleet already wanted many Provi&s;ions, of which Beer was the chief; which, by the countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was in a &s;hort time procured in a rea&s;onable proportion; and then the <MILESTONE N="50"> Prince &s;et &s;ail fir&s;t for <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road, then for the <HI>Downs;</HI> having <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince comes into the</HI> Downs <HI>with the Fleet.</HI></NOTE> &s;ent his Brother, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> with all his Family to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to remain there.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="1290">
THOUGH the Duke was exceedingly troubled to leave the Fleet, which he had been per&s;waded to look upon as his Province, yet he could not but acknowledge, that right rea&s;on would not permit they &s;hould both be ventur'd at one time on board the Fleet; and, the Prince deter|mining to engage his own Per&s;on, he &s;ubmitted to the determination; and was well content to remain with his Si&s;ter. The Prince did not think fit to remove the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> (who, he knew, was much relied upon by the Presbyterian Party) from the Charge the Duke had given him; though he was not much known to the Seamen. But Captain <HI>Batten</HI> coming at the &s;ame time when his Highne&s;s did to the Fleet, <MILESTONE N="10"> and bringing the <HI>Con&s;tant Warwick,</HI> one of the be&s;t Frigats the Parlia|ment had built, with <HI>Jordan,</HI> and two or three Seamen of good Com|mand, his Highne&s;s knighted him, and made him Rere Admiral of the Fleet; believing, that he could not do a more popular and acceptable thing to the Seamen, than by putting the &s;ame Man, who had Com|manded them &s;o many years, over them again at this time; who&s;e ex|perience and government would &s;upply the defects and want of skill of the Vice-Admiral, who was very willing to be advi&s;ed by him. But the Prince &s;hortly after found he was mi&s;taken in that expedient, and that the Seamen (who defired to &s;erve the King upon the clear principles of <MILESTONE N="20"> obedience, and loyalty) did not in any degree affect <HI>Batten,</HI> becau&s;e he had failed in both, and was now of a Party towards which they had no veneration. The truth is, the Prince came prepared and di&s;po&s;ed from the Queen, to depend wholely upon the Presbyterian Party, which, be|&s;ides the power of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which was every day expected to invade <HI>England,</HI> was thought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the &s;trength of the City of <HI>London;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and M^r <HI>Long,</HI> the Prince's Secretary, were tru&s;ted by the Queen to keep the Prince &s;teady and fa&s;t to that dependence; and his Highne&s;s was injoyn'd to be entirely advi&s;ed by them; though all the other Lords about him were of another mind, <MILESTONE N="30"> and the Prince him&s;elf not inclined that way. D^r <HI>Steward,</HI> the Dean of the King's Chappel, whom his Maje&s;ty had recommended to his Son to in&s;truct him in all matters relating to the Church, and D^r <HI>Earles,</HI> and the re&s;t of his Chaplains, waited diligently upon him to prevent tho&s;e Infu&s;ions. But, by tho&s;e two, the benefit of this Fleet was principally con&s;ider'd, as a happy means to put the Prince on Shore, that he might be in the head of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; and no doubt if that Army had been then enter'd into <HI>England,</HI> as it was very &s;hortly after, the Prince would have been directed, with the Fleet, <Q>&startq;to have followed all the advice&endq; which &s;hould have been &s;ent from the <HI>Scots.</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>IN the mean time it was thought mo&s;t coun&s;elable, after the Prince had &s;ailed &s;ome days about the Coa&s;t, that the Kingdom might generally know that his Highne&s;s was there, that they &s;hould all go into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and lye &s;till there; by which they expected two great Ad|vantages; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence into the River of</HI> Thames.</NOTE> fir&s;t, that the City would be thereby engaged to declare it &s;elf, when they &s;aw all their Trade ob&s;tructed; and that their Ships home|wards bound, of which, at that Sea&s;on of the year, they expected many, mu&s;t fall into the Prince's hands; and then, that the pre&s;ence of the Prince in the River would hinder the Parliament from getting Seamen, and from &s;etting out that Fleet which they were preparing to reduce the <MILESTONE N="50"> other, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> whom they thought fit, in this exigent, again to imploy; and who, by accepting the Charge, thought he &s;hould be in a better po&s;ture to choo&s;e his Party, in any other alteration that &s;hould happen at Land.</P>

Upon which Argument of the &s;ur|pri&s;e of <HI>Pontfret,</HI> We &s;hall enlarge hereafter, before We &s;peak of the Tragick conclu&s;ion of this Enterpri&s;e. All Affairs were in this motion in <HI>England,</HI> before there was any appearance of an Army in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they had promi&s;ed &s;hould be ready to march by the beginning of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED as to the rai&s;ing an Army in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the difficulties were <MILESTONE N="20"> well nigh over, nor did they ever look upon that as a thing that would trouble them, but who &s;hould Command, and be General of this Army was the matter upon which the &s;ucce&s;s of all they propo&s;ed would de|pend; and if they could not procure Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> to be made choice of for that Service, they would promi&s;e them&s;elves no good i&s;&s;ue of the Undertaking. It was a hard thing to remove the old General <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> who had been hitherto in the head of their Army in all their pro&s;perous Succe&s;&s;es; but he was in the confidence of <HI>Argyle,</HI> which was objection enough again&s;t him, if there were no other; and the Man was grown old, and appear'd, in the Actions of the la&s;t Expedition into <HI>England,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> very unequal to the Command. And therefore &s;ome expedient was to be found to be rid of him; and they found it no hard matter to prevail with him to decline the Command, upon pretence of his Age and In|firmities, when in truth he had no mind to venture his honour again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> except a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which had been his good fortune in all the Actions of Moment he had perform'd in this War; and when he had been de&s;titute of that help, he had allways receiv'd &s;ome Affront. When by this means there was a new General to be named, Duke <HI>Ha|milton</HI> was propo&s;ed, as a fit Man to be imployed to redeem the honour of the Nation. He had formerly di&s;charged the office of General under <MILESTONE N="40"> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> that had now declined the imploy|ment, was Major General under him; and therefore could not be thought to be without ample experience of War.</P>
<P>WHILST this was depending, <HI>Argyle</HI> took notice of S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI>'s, and S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI>'s being in the Town, and of &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es which they had u&s;ed, or &s;ome other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers in their Company, and de&s;ired <Q>&startq;that, if they were to have any Command in the Army, they might pre&s;ently take the Covenant; and that there might be a general Declaration, that there &s;hould be neither Officer nor Soldier receiv'd into their Army, before he had fir&s;t taken the <MILESTONE N="50"> Covenant; and that, after they were enter'd into the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> they &s;hould make no conjunction with any Forces, or Per|&s;ons,&endq; who had not done, or &s;hould refu&s;e to do the &s;ame.</Q> This propo&s;al

found no oppo&s;ition; they who were mo&s;t forward to rai&s;e the Army for the delivery of the King, being as violent as any to advance that Declaration. And though Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and his Brother of <HI>Lanrick</HI> did as well di&s;approve it in their own judgements, as they did fore&s;ee, out of the long experience they had of <HI>England,</HI> what prejudice it would bring upon them there, yet they had not the Courage in any degree to &s;peak again&s;t it; and the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lau|therdale</HI> were as pa&s;&s;ionate for the Advancement of it, as <HI>Argyle</HI> him|&s;elf; and &s;eem'd to think that tho&s;e two Gentlemen either had already taken, or would be willing to take it. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>IT can hardly be believ'd, that, after &s;o long knowledge of <HI>England,</HI> and their ob&s;ervation of whom the King's Party did con&s;i&s;t, after their &s;o often conferences with the King without prevailing upon him, in any degree, either to pre&s;erve him&s;elf at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> from being deli|ver'd up to the Parliament, or in their la&s;t agitation with him, when he yielded to &s;o many unrea&s;onable particulars to gratify them, to con|&s;ent to or promi&s;e, <Q>&startq;that any Man &s;hould be compelled to take the&endq; Covenant;</Q> that they &s;hould &s;till adhere to that fatal Combination again&s;t the Church, which they could never hope to bring to pa&s;s, ex|cept they intended only to change the hand, and to keep the King un|der <MILESTONE N="20"> as &s;trict a re&s;traint, when they &s;hould get him into Their hands, as he was under the domination of the Parliament and Army: yet they were &s;o infatuated with this re&s;olution, that they di&s;covered their ap|prehen&s;ion of the King's Party, and de&s;ign'd no le&s;s to oppre&s;s Them than the Independents, and Anabapti&s;ts; and upon the news of the re|volt of the Fleet from the Parliament to the King, the In&s;urrection in <HI>Kent,</HI> and other Places, and the general Inclinations throughout the Kingdom for the King, they &s;lacken'd their preparations, that they might defer their March, to the end that all that &s;trength might be op|pre&s;&s;ed and reduced, that &s;o they might be ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters after they <MILESTONE N="30"> had prevailed over the Army. And at la&s;t, when they could defer their March no longer, upon the importunate pre&s;&s;ure of their Friends in <HI>London,</HI> they &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> with tho&s;e in&s;olent In|&s;tructions, which will be mention'd anon, and po&s;itively required the Prince immediately to repair to them; <Q>declaring, &startq;that if his Per&s;on &s;hould not be forthwith in their Army, they would return again into&endq; <HI>Scotland</HI> without making any attempt;</Q> and the knowing this re&s;olu|tion, was the rea&s;on that the Queen was &s;o po&s;itive in her In&s;tructions, notwith&s;tanding the appearance of any other Advantage to the King in <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> and S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> no &s;ooner heard of this Declaration, than they went to tho&s;e Lords, and expo&s;tulated very &s;harply with them, for <Q>&startq;having broken their Faiths, and betrayed&endq; them into their Country;</Q> where they were looked upon as Enemies. They were An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that they mu&s;t give over their de&s;ign to redeem the King, or yield to this determination, which their Parliament was&endq; &s;o firm and united in;</Q> and would never depart from. And therefore they entreated them with all imaginable importunity, that they would take the Covenant; &s;ome of them defiring to confer with them upon it, and undertaking to &s;atisfy them, that the Covenant did not include <MILESTONE N="50"> tho&s;e things in it, which they thought it did. But when they &s;aw tho&s;e Gentlemen would not be prevailed with, but that on the contrary they re&s;olv'd pre&s;ently to leave the Country; <Q>and told them, &startq;they would
<PB N="114" REF="1340">
undeceive tho&s;e hone&s;t People in <HI>England,</HI> who were too much in|clined to tru&s;t them; and that they &s;hould find that they had a harder&endq; work in hand than they imagined;</Q> the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords knew well enough of what importance their pre&s;ence was to be to them, for their very entrance into <HI>England;</HI> and thereupon de&s;ired them, <Q>&startq;that they would have a little patience, and again ab&s;ent them&s;elves from <HI>Edenborough,</HI> till the heat of this di&s;pute was over, and till the Army &s;hould be&endq; ready to march;</Q> and Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had a marvellous in&s;inua|tion to get him&s;elf believ'd, a&s;&s;ured them in confidence, <Q>&startq;that a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hould find him&s;elf in the head of his Army, and upon their <MILESTONE N="10"> march, there &s;hould be no more talk of Covenants, but that all the&endq; King's Friends &s;hould be welcome, and without di&s;tinction.</Q> So they left <HI>Edenborough</HI> again, and went to their old Quarters; where they had not &s;tayed long, before the Duke &s;ent for them to come to him in private; and, after a very chearful reception, he told them, <Q>&startq;he was now ready; and that their Friends in <HI>England</HI> called &s;o importunately for them, that he was re&s;olv'd to march in very few days; which he thought nece&s;&s;ary to communicate to them, not only for the Friend|&s;hip he had for them; which would allways keep him without re&s;erve towards them; but becau&s;e he mu&s;t depend upon them two to &s;urpri&s;e <MILESTONE N="20"> the Towns of <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> again&s;t the time he &s;hould be able to march thither; for he intended to march between tho&s;e two&endq; Places.</Q></P>
<P>THE work was not hard to be perform'd by them, they having, from their fir&s;t entrance into <HI>Scotland,</HI> adju&s;ted with their Friends who inhabited near tho&s;e places, to be ready for that enterpri&s;e when they &s;hould be called upon; which they then believ'd would have been much &s;ooner; &s;o that they were willing to undertake it, and demanded Com|mi&s;&s;ions from the Duke for the doing thereof; which he excu&s;ed him|&s;elf for not giving, under pretence of <Q>&startq;the &s;ecrecy that was nece&s;&s;ary; <MILESTONE N="30"> in re&s;pect whereof he would not tru&s;t his own Secretary; and like|wi&s;e, as a thing unnece&s;&s;ary for the work; &s;ince it was their own re|putation and intere&s;t, and their being known to have been allways tru&s;ted by the King, by which they could bring it to pa&s;s, and not His&endq; Commi&s;&s;ion;</Q> for which tho&s;e Towns would have no reverence. Be|&s;ides, he told them, <Q>&startq;that the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> had &s;till prote&s;ted again&s;t their beginning the War by any Act of Ho&s;tility again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in forcing any of the Towns; which was not nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to the King's deliverance; but that an Army might march to the place where the King was, to the end that tho&s;e Me&s;&s;engers who were <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ent by the State to &s;peak with the King, might have liberty to &s;peak with his Maje&s;ty; which was a Right of the Kingdom, and the de|manding it could be no breach of the Pacification between the two&endq; Kingdoms.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Argument, they knew, was not rea&s;onable enough to &s;way the Duke. But they fore&s;aw two other rea&s;ons, which did prevail with him not to give tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions they de&s;ired, which otherwi&s;e might have been given with the &s;ame &s;ecrecy that the bu&s;ine&s;s was to be acted with; the one, the Order again&s;t giving any Commi&s;&s;ion to any Man before he had taken the Covenant: And how much Authority &s;oever <MILESTONE N="50"> the Duke might take upon him to di&s;pen&s;e with that Order after he &s;hould be in <HI>England,</HI> it might not be convenient that he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume it whil&s;t he remain'd yet at <HI>Edenborough:</HI> the other was, that, when
<PB N="115" REF="1350">
they had done it without his Commi&s;&s;ion, he might, upon his March, or a&s;&s;oon as he came thither, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the Government, and put <HI>Scots-</HI>men into their places; the la&s;t of which he did not di&s;&s;emble to them; <Q>but confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that, though the Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would not attempt the taking of tho&s;e Towns, yet when They &s;hould be taken, they would expect the Government thereof &s;hould be in Their hands, and depend upon Them, without which they &s;hould not be able to&endq; &s;end him tho&s;e continual &s;upplies which he expected from them.</Q> And there being then a recruit of five or &s;ix thou&s;and, which S^r <HI>George Mon|roe</HI> had near rai&s;ed in the North, and from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who were to begin <MILESTONE N="10"> their March after him, a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hould be out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the two Gentlemen had no purpo&s;e of remaining in tho&s;e Governments, well knowing that their pre&s;ence would be of importance to the Army, at lea&s;t whil&s;t they &s;tayed in the Northern Counties; yet they knew well, it was for the Service that tho&s;e Towns &s;hould remain in the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> without which few of the Gentlemen of tho&s;e parts would declare them&s;elves, how well affected &s;oever they were; which when they had offer'd to the Duke, they left it to him, and accepted the im|ployment he pre&s;&s;ed them to undertake, and parted to put the &s;ame in execution in both places at one time, all things being concerted be|tween <MILESTONE N="20"> them to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> had &s;everal Officers, and Soldiers, laid privately on the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> &s;ide to wait his Commands, and more on the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> there being two or three good Families within two or three miles of <HI>Berwick,</HI> who were well affected and ready to appear when they &s;hould be required; in expectation whereof they had harboured many Men. Some of them S^r <HI>Marmaduke</HI> appointed to meet him, on the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> &s;ide, at a place about a mile di&s;tant from <HI>Berwick,</HI> the night be|fore he intended the &s;urpri&s;e, and the re&s;t to be in the Town by the ri&s;ing of the Sun; &s;ome about the Market place, and &s;ome upon the Bridge, <MILESTONE N="30"> by which he mu&s;t enter. The next morning, being Market day, when great droves of little Hor&s;es, laden with &s;acks of Corn, allways re&s;orted to the Town, S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> with about a hundred Hor&s;e, and &s;ome few Foot, which walked with the Market People, pre&s;ently after Sun ri&s;ing, was upon the Bridge, before there was any apprehen|&s;ion; and finding his Friends there whom he expected, he cau&s;ed the Bridge pre&s;ently to be drawn up, and guarded by his Foot, and &s;ent others to the other parts. Him&s;elf with mo&s;t of his Troops went into the Market place, where he found his Country Friends ready to do all he would command. There was &s;o general a con&s;ternation &s;ei&s;ed upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> M. Lang|dale <HI>&s;urpri&s;es'</HI> Berwick, <HI>and S^r</HI> P.

S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave,</HI> with as little oppo&s;ition, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> where he had a greater Intere&s;t; and the People were generally better affected to the King, and more di&s;inclined to the <HI>Scots</HI> than tho&s;e of <HI>Berwick</HI> u&s;ed to be; and they both ha&s;ten'd adverti&s;ement to the Duke of what they had done.</P>
<P>IT will be much wonder'd at, that after <HI>Cromwell</HI> plainly fore&s;aw they &s;hould have a War with <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had con&s;tant Intelligence <MILESTONE N="50"> from thence of the Advances they made, he did not take care to put Garri&s;ons into tho&s;e two important places, the very &s;trength of which could for &s;ome time have with&s;tood all the power which <HI>Scotland</HI> could
<PB N="116" REF="1360">
have brought again&s;t them. But the &s;ame rea&s;on which had been cur|rent at <HI>Edenborough</HI> to this very time, had prevailed at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> It was &s;pecially provided for by the Act of Pacification between the two Kingdoms, when the Parliaments of both Kingdoms combined again&s;t the King, <Q>&startq;that there &s;hould be no more Garri&s;ons kept on either &s;ide&endq; in <HI>Berwick</HI> or <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI></Q> where they were then disbanded, and &s;ome of their Fortifications &s;lighted; which could ea&s;ily have been repaired; and, without repairing, could have kept out an Enemy for &s;ome time. And the Parliament would not now permit any Men to be &s;ent thither, that the <HI>Scots</HI> might not pretend that the War was begun by Them; but <MILESTONE N="10"> left <HI>Berwick</HI> to the Government of the Mayor and the Citizens; who could have defended them&s;elves again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> if they had expected them. But the truth is, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;o perfect a contempt of the whole &s;trength of that Nation, that he never cared what Advantage ground they had upon any Field, or what place they ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> and S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> were no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> than all the Gentlemen, Officers, and Soldiers thereabouts, who had formerly &s;erv'd the King, re&s;orted and flocked to them well armed, appointed, and provided for the War; &s;o that they had not only very &s;ufficient Garri&s;ons to keep tho&s;e places, <MILESTONE N="20"> but Troops enough of Hor&s;e to free the adjacent Counties from tho&s;e Forces, and Committees, and other Per&s;ons, who were either publickly engaged in, or well known privately to wi&s;h well to the Parliament. It was upon the 28^t^h of <HI>April</HI> that S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf of <HI>Berwick;</HI> and &s;oon after S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> about eight of the Clock at night, many Gentlemen of the Neighbours being in, and about the Town, expecting his Arrival; &s;o that the Ci|tizens were in confu&s;ion, and made little re&s;i&s;tance. It is very true, they had both given under their hands to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that they would deliver up the Towns to him when he &s;hould require them; he having <MILESTONE N="30"> a&s;&s;ured them, <Q>&startq;that the King had promi&s;ed, under his hand, that tho&s;e&endq; two Towns &s;hould be deliver'd into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Scots;</HI></Q> which it mu&s;t needs be &s;uppo&s;ed that they &s;hould fir&s;t take from the Parlia|ment, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they were both when the King &s;ign'd the En|gagement at <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> Ca&s;tle. And the Duke had not only refu&s;ed to give them any Men, or other A&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the taking them, but, as hath been &s;aid, would not grant them his Commi&s;&s;ion to perform it; pretending <Q>&startq;that he dur&s;t not do it, becau&s;e they were bound not to&endq; begin the War:</Q> only He, and the other Lords of his Fraternity, pro|mi&s;ed <Q>&startq;to &s;end five hundred Muskets, and ten Barrels of Powder to <MILESTONE N="40"> each Garri&s;on; and that their whole Army &s;hould march into <HI>England</HI> within twenty days; and that, if they were &s;ooner in di&s;tre&s;s, they&endq; &s;hould be &s;ure to be reliev'd.</Q></P>
<P>BUT after he heard that both places were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them, he de|ferr'd not to &s;end a Governour and Garri&s;on to receive <HI>Berwick;</HI> to whom S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> deliver'd it according to his promi&s;e; and was required <Q>&startq;to march with all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the parts adjacent to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and there to encrea&s;e his Troops to what Number he could,&endq; with what expedition was po&s;&s;ible;</Q> which he perform'd &s;o effectually, that, in very few days, he had a Rendezvous upon a Heath within five <MILESTONE N="50"> Miles of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> where he mu&s;ter'd above three thou&s;and Foot well armed, and &s;even hundred Hor&s;e not &s;o well armed; all which were rai&s;ed in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> over and above the Garri&s;on
<PB N="117" REF="1370">
of <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> which yet remain'd under S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave;</HI> and, within two days, five hundred Hor&s;e, very well appointed, came out of <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI> the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> and the Neighbour parts; &s;o that S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> re&s;olv'd pre&s;ently to march into <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> to reduce tho&s;e who were for the Parliament there; which he could ea&s;ily have done, the Lord <HI>Byron</HI> being ready upon the Borders of <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> to have joyn'd with him. But this quick advance and progre&s;s towards an Army, was not well looked upon at <HI>Edenborough;</HI> <Q>and an Expre&s;s was di&s;patched, with po&s;itive Orders to S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> &startq;not to engage or fight with the Enemy, upon what advantage &s;oever,&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> until the <HI>Scots</HI> Army &s;hould come up.</Q> And wherever that Expre&s;s &s;hould overtake S^r <HI>Marmaduke,</HI> he was immediately to retire with his Forces near <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> which he obeyed a&s;&s;oon as he receiv'd the Order, and when he might have marched again&s;t <HI>Lambert;</HI> who was &s;ent be|fore with a le&s;s &s;trength than S^r <HI>Marmaduke</HI> commanded, and which in all probability would have been defeated.</P>
<P>BUT, as if this had not been di&s;couragement enough, within one or two days after that Expre&s;s, Letters were &s;ent from the Council in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> by which S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> was very &s;everly reprehended, <Q>&startq;for receiving Papi&s;ts into his Army, and not owning the Covenant in&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> the Declarations which he had publi&s;hed;</Q> <Q>and told, &startq;that he &s;hould receive no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Them, except the Covenant was embraced&endq; by all his Army.</Q> <Q>This &s;truck at the root of all their hopes; and was &s;o contrary to all the Engagements they had receiv'd from the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords, both by Words and Letters, &startq;that they &s;hould never be troubled with any &s;uch motions, after they were once upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ground; and that then they &s;hould proceed upon tho&s;e Grounds as were like to&endq; bring in mo&s;t Men to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance;</Q> that S^r <HI>Marmaduke</HI> prevailed with S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> to make a Journey forthwith to <HI>Edenborough,</HI> to expo&s;tulate upon the whole matter, and declare their firm re&s;olution <MILESTONE N="30"> to the Lords there.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave,</HI> that it might appear that they did not exclude any who had taken the Covenant, and were willing to joyn with them, carried a li&s;t with him of the names of many Officers in their Troops who had been compelled to take the Covenant before they could be ad|mitted to compo&s;ition, or procure the &s;eque&s;trations to be taken from their E&s;tates, and of &s;ome others who had taken it for quietne&s;s &s;ake in the places where they liv'd; with which the <HI>Scots</HI> were in &s;ome degree mitigated, but &s;eem'd to retain &s;till their rigour, that it &s;hould be &s;ub|mitted to by the whole Army. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>IN the mean time <HI>Lambert,</HI> having gotten a &s;trong Body of Hor&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>marches a|gain&s;t them.</HI></NOTE> and Foot, advanced upon S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale;</HI> <Q>who, being enjoyn'd not to Fight, was forced to retire to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and &s;uffer him&s;elf to be, upon the matter, blocked up on one &s;ide, whil&s;t he &s;ent Letter upon Letter to the Duke &startq;to ha&s;ten his March, or to &s;end &s;ome Troops to&endq; his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Liberty to Fight the Enemy.</Q></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> had found the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> very <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Norwich <HI>at</HI> Maid&s;tone <HI>with the</HI> Ken|ti&s;h <HI>Forces.</HI></NOTE> numerous, but likewi&s;e very di&s;orderly, and without Government, nor ea&s;y to be reduced under any Command. They had been long enough together to enter into jealou&s;ies of one another, and from thence into <MILESTONE N="50"> Factions, and were of &s;everal opinions what they were to do. And though they all pretended an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience to the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> as their General, yet no Man forbore to deliver his opinion
<PB N="118" REF="1380">
of Things and Per&s;ons, nor to enquire by what means they had fir&s;t been drawn together; which implyed that many Men wi&s;hed they had been to begin again. The Earl was a Man fitter to have drawn &s;uch a Body together by his frolick and plea&s;ant humour, which reconciled People of all con&s;titutions wonderfully to him, than to form and conduct them towards any Enterpri&s;e. He had allways liv'd in the Court in &s;uch a &s;tation of bu&s;ine&s;s as rai&s;ed him very few Enemies; and his plea&s;ant and jovial Nature, which was every where acceptable, made him many Friends, at lea&s;t made many delight in his Company. So that by the great favour he had with the King and Queen, and the little prejudice <MILESTONE N="10"> he &s;tood in with any Body el&s;e, he was very like, if the fatal di&s;order of the time had not bla&s;ted his hopes, to have grown Ma&s;ter of a very fair Fortune; which was all that he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf. But he had no experience or knowledge of the War, nor knew how to exerci&s;e the Of|fice he had taken upon him of General, but was very willing to plea&s;e every Man, and comply with every Bodies humour; which was quickly di&s;cover'd; and &s;o Men withdrew the Reverence they were prepared to have paid him, and grew more ob&s;tinate in their own opinions what was to be done; and the indi&s;po&s;ition increa&s;ed, when they heard that <HI>Fairfax</HI> him&s;elf was appointed to march towards them. They who be&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> under&s;tood the Affair, and how to apply the &s;trength they had to the be&s;t advantage, advi&s;ed <Q>&startq;that they might retire beyond <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and by breaking down the Bridge there, and Fortifying another Pa&s;s or two, which was ea&s;y to be done, they might keep the Enemy from&endq; entring into the Ea&s;t of <HI>Kent</HI></Q> (which was the large&s;t and be&s;t part of that rich and populous County) <Q>&startq;longer than they would be able to continue the attempt, for fear of being inclo&s;ed by an Enemy at their back, if the City of <HI>London,</HI> or tho&s;e of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who were mo&s;t &s;poken of, had a mind to declare for the King; and by this means they might&endq; be &s;ure of a corre&s;pondence with the Fleet;</Q> of the return whereof in <MILESTONE N="30"> a &s;hort time they were mo&s;t confident; and the more, becau&s;e &s;ome Gen|tlemen of their own Body were on board the Fleet in &s;ome Authority, who, they knew, would ha&s;ten their return all they could.</P>
<P>MANY were the more per&s;waded that the Fleet was gone to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> for the re&s;cue of the King, becau&s;e tho&s;e Gentlemen were gone in it. And without doubt that advice was the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, and if it had been pur&s;ued might have kept the Enemy at a Bay for &s;ome time. But other Men le&s;s rea&s;onable were of another mind: they did not be|lieve <Q>&startq;that <HI>Fairfax</HI> could have lei&s;ure to look after them; they were confident that the Parliament had &s;o many Enemies to look after, <MILESTONE N="40"> tho&s;e in <HI>Wales</HI> growing &s;trong, and having beaten the Party that had been &s;ent again&s;t them; and the Officers in the North, who had &s;ei&s;ed upon <HI>Pontfret</HI> Ca&s;tle in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and had drawn in a &s;trong Garri&s;on from the parts adjacent, had a Body of Hor&s;e, that infe&s;ted all tho&s;e parts; and the <HI>Scots</HI> were upon their march for <HI>England;</HI> and there|fore they concluded that <HI>Fairfax</HI> could not be at lei&s;ure to vi&s;it them: The retiring would be an Argument of fear, which would di&s;hearten their Friends at <HI>London,</HI> and all tho&s;e of that part of <HI>Kent,</HI> which mu&s;t be de&s;erted upon their Retreat, would de&s;ert them, a&s;&s;oon as that re|&s;olution&endq; &s;hould be known;</Q> and therefore they de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;that they <MILESTONE N="50"> might all march towards <HI>Black-Heath;</HI> which would rai&s;e the Spirits of their Friends, and many would re&s;ort every day to them out of <HI>Lon|don&endq;</HI> and the parts adjacent; all which were eminently well affected.</Q></P>

THE Noi&s;e for this was the greater, and the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> him|&s;elf <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Kenti&s;h <HI>Army mar$kes towards</HI> Black-Heath</NOTE> was thereby &s;wayed to be of that opinion; and &s;o they re&s;olv'd to advance, and a &s;hort day was appointed for a general Rendezvous upon <HI>Black-Heath;</HI> and Orders were &s;ent out accordingly.</P>
<P>THE di&s;turbance in &s;o many places made the re&s;olution of the Ge|neral now to be known, which had been hitherto carefully concealed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that <HI>Fairfax</HI> him&s;elf was not willing to march again&s;t the <HI>Scots;</HI></Q> which was not now coun&s;elable for him to do. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was very willing to take that Province to him&s;elf, and had allways &s;o great a contempt of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that he was willing to march with a much le&s;&s;er Number than <MILESTONE N="10"> he well knew the <HI>Scots</HI> Army to con&s;i&s;t of; and being inform'd which way the <HI>Scots</HI> re&s;olv'd to enter the Kingdom, and that they were even ready to march, he advanced to meet them, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>ad|vances again&s;t the</HI> Scots:</NOTE> enter'd, with tho&s;e Troops which he had made choice of, having fir&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Ri&s;ings in South <HI>Wales</HI> by taking of <HI>Pembroke</HI> Ca&s;tle, and making Pri&s;oners therein <HI>Laughorn, Powel,</HI> and <HI>Poyer,</HI> the heads of that In&s;urrection, and not troubling him&s;elf with <HI>Pontfret</HI> Ca&s;tle, which he thought would not be of great con&s;equence, if the <HI>Scots</HI> were &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX, with a numerous part of the Army, remain'd in and about <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>London</HI> to &s;uppre&s;s the In&s;urrection in <HI>Kent,</HI> and watch any other which &s;hould fall out in the City or thereabouts; of which they had more ap|prehen&s;ion than of all the power of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And &s;o when the Parlia|ment was adverti&s;ed by their Troops which were fir&s;t &s;ent, that they were too weak to advance farther, and heard that the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> was declared General of the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Troops, and was marching in the head of them towards <HI>Black-Heath, Fairfax</HI> drew all his Army together, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax <HI>a|gain&s;t the</HI> Kenti&s;h <HI>Men.</HI></NOTE> and his Cannon, and marched over <HI>London</HI> Bridge to meet the Men of <HI>Kent</HI> at <HI>Black-Heath,</HI> and to &s;top their march to <HI>London.</HI> The Earl was now advanced &s;o far, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> advanced too fa&s;t to put the for|mer <MILESTONE N="30"> Coun&s;el in practice, of breaking down the Bridges, and keeping the Pa&s;&s;es, and they who had oppo&s;ed that Coun&s;el, and were &s;o forward to advance, thought they were now too far. The Country-men were weary of being all night in the Field, though it was the warme&s;t Sea&s;on of the Year, and many withdrew them&s;elves every day; &s;o that they who re|main'd had no rea&s;on to believe them&s;elves equal to the power that marched towards them, and yet there were more left than could hope to pre&s;erve them&s;elves by flying, and by concealment. And therefore, as <HI>Fairfax</HI> advanced, the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Forces drew back; made &s;everal &s;tands; but, being hard pre&s;s'd, they divided, &s;ome retiring to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> others <MILESTONE N="40"> to <HI>Maid&s;tone.</HI> Tho&s;e at <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> had a &s;harp Encounter with the Ge|neral's whole &s;trength, and fought very bravely, but were at la&s;t de|feated. In the mean time the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and divers other Of|ficers who were with the Party at <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> quitting that place, marched back towards <HI>London,</HI> in hope &s;till of the City's joyning with them. But that failing, and apprehending <HI>Fairfax</HI> would be &s;oon in their Rear, the Earl and tho&s;e who remain'd, and de&s;ign'd to run the utmo&s;t hazard, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Norwich, <HI>and &s;ome Forces, tran&s;port them&s;elves in|to</HI> E&s;&s;ex; <HI>and &s;ix in</HI> Colche|&s;ter</NOTE> re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s them&s;elves and their Hor&s;es by &s;uch Boats as they had ready about <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and down the River, over into <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> where they knew they had many Friends, and where <HI>Fairfax</HI> and his Army <MILESTONE N="50"> could not vi&s;it them in &s;ome days. So they made a &s;hift to tran&s;port them&s;elves to the number of near a thou&s;and Men, Hor&s;e and Foot; whereof many were Officers and Soldiers who had &s;erv'd the King, and
<PB N="120" REF="1400">
young Gentlemen grown up in Loyal Families, who had been too young to appear before.</P>
<P>THEY found many Per&s;ons in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> ready to joyn with them, who came &s;ooner together than they intended, upon the alarm of <HI>Kent;</HI> and who had purpo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed over into <HI>Kent</HI> to have joyn'd with, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted tho&s;e who had &s;o frankly appear'd for the King, if they had not been prevented by their unexpected coming to Them. There was the brave Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> S^r <HI>William Compton,</HI> S^r <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> S^r <HI>George Li&s;le,</HI> all excellent Officers. There was S^r <HI>Bernard Ga&s;coign,</HI> and many other Gentlemen, and Officers of Name, who had drawn together <MILESTONE N="10"> many Soldiers. To the&s;e joyn'd Colonel <HI>Farr;</HI> who had &s;erv'd the Par|liament, and was a known creature and confident of the Earl of <HI>War|wick</HI>'s, and had at that time the Command of <HI>Languard Point,</HI> a Fort of importance upon the Sea; &s;o that when they were all come together, with tho&s;e who came from <HI>Kent,</HI> they made a Body of above three thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, with Officers enough to have form'd and commanded a very good Army.</P>
<P>THEY well knew <HI>Fairfax</HI> would quickly vi&s;it them, and therefore they cho&s;e to po&s;t them&s;elves in <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> a great and populous Town, which though unfortified, they ca&s;t up &s;uch works before the Avenues, <MILESTONE N="20"> that they did not much fear to be forced by an a&s;&s;ault; and re&s;olv'd to expect a conjunction with other of their Friends; and were in great hopes that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which they heard was upon its march, would be with them before they could be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THEY had &s;carce put them&s;elves and the Town, which was not glad of their company, into any order, before <HI>Fairfax</HI> came upon them; who made no &s;tay in <HI>Kent,</HI> after he heard what was become of the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> and his Friends; but left two or three Troops of Hor&s;e to &s;ettle that County, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Committees, who had been driven from thence, and returning now victorious knew well enough <MILESTONE N="30"> how to deal with tho&s;e who had revolted from them. When he came <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax <HI>be|&s;ieges them.</HI></NOTE> fir&s;t before <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> and &s;aw it without any Fortifications, he thought pre&s;ently to have enter'd the Town with his Army; but he found &s;o rude re&s;i&s;tance, that by the advice of <HI>Ireton,</HI> who was left by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to watch the General as well as the Army, he re&s;olv'd to encompa&s;s i$ with his Troops, and without hazarding the lo&s;s of Men to block them up, till Famine &s;hould reduce them; and di&s;po&s;ed his Army accordingly; which quickly &s;topped up all Pa&s;&s;ages, by which either Men or Provi|&s;ions &s;hould get into the Town; though by many brave Sallies from within, their Quarters were often beaten up, and many valiant Men <MILESTONE N="40"> were lo&s;t on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>THE Fleet, after it had, with all imaginable chearfulne&s;s, &s;ubmitted to the command of the Prince, was not &s;o active as it was expected it &s;hould be; and was very much the wor&s;e for the Factions, and Divi|&s;ions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the Prince's Fleet</NOTE> which were among&s;t tho&s;e who attended upon the Prince; who, according to their &s;everal humours, endeavour'd to work upon the Sea|men; a People capable of any impre&s;&s;ion, but not very retentive of it. Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> to whom the Prince was very kind, did not, upon many old conte&s;ts in the late War, love the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who was not of a temper that cared to court him: and there was one, who had the <MILESTONE N="50"> greate&s;t influence on Prince <HI>Rupert, Herbert</HI> the Atturney General, that of all Men living was mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to make di&s;cord and di&s;agree|ment between Men; all his faculties being re&s;olv'd into a &s;pirit of con|tradicting,
<PB N="121" REF="1410">
di&s;puting, and wrangling upon any thing that was propo&s;ed. He having no title or pretence to interpo&s;e in Councils, and yet there being no &s;ecret in the debates there, found it ea&s;y to infu&s;e into Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who totally re&s;ign'd him&s;elf to his advice, &s;uch Arguments as might di&s;turb any re&s;olution: and there were &s;o many who were angry that they were not admitted into the Council, as the Lords <HI>Piercy, Wilmot,</HI> and <HI>Wentworth,</HI> that it was no hard matter to get any thing di&s;liked that was re&s;olv'd there. They had all that admi&s;&s;ion and coun|tenance from the Prince, that they had as much confidence to &s;peak to, and before him, as any where el&s;e. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had a great mind <MILESTONE N="10"> that &s;omewhat &s;hould be attempted upon the Coa&s;t, which might have cau&s;ed &s;ome Sea Towns, and the parts adjacent, to have declared for the King; which &s;eem'd not a de&s;ign that would bear a rea&s;onable di&s;|cour&s;e. But Action was a very grateful word to the Seamen, and they who oppo&s;ed any thing that tended toward it, were looked upon with great jealou&s;y and prejudice. But the Prince was obliged, as hath been &s;aid, by his In&s;tructions at <HI>Paris,</HI> not to engage him&s;elf in any thing that might divert him from being ready at the minute when the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould call for his pre&s;ence; and they expected the fir&s;t intimation of that from <HI>London;</HI> from whence they had the a&s;&s;urance already, that <MILESTONE N="20"> Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> was enter'd into the Kingdom with an Army of above thirty thou&s;and Men; which was then generally thought true, though they fell far &s;hort of the number.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince came with the Fleet into the Sea from <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> he met a Ship of <HI>London</HI> bound for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and laden with Cloath by the Company of Merchant Adventurers, who did not think that the Fleet could have been &s;o &s;oon ready for Sea. This Ship was taken, and the Decks being Sealed up, was kept under Guard with the Fleet; which, at their Entrance into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> took many <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It enters the River of</HI> Thames; <HI>takes &s;everal Ships.</HI></NOTE> other Ships of great value outward bound, and intercepted all Ve&s;&s;els <MILESTONE N="30"> homeward bound, and among&s;t tho&s;e an Ea&s;t India Ship richly laden, and the more welcome becau&s;e the Ship it &s;elf was a very &s;trong Ship, and would make an excellent Man of War, and the Captain thereof was a Seaman of Courage, and Experience, and was very well inclined to &s;erve the King: and, without doubt, if all the Ships which were then taken, had been &s;ent into &s;ome &s;ecure Ports, the value of the Goods would have mounted to &s;o great a Sum, as might have countervailed a very great Expence at Sea and Land. But as it would have been very difficult to have found &s;uch a &s;ecure Port, where that Trea&s;ure might have been depo&s;ited, &s;o it was not &s;uitable to tho&s;e mea&s;ures which had <MILESTONE N="40"> been taken, and were &s;till pur&s;ued, for his Royal Highne&s;s's proceedings. The City of <HI>London</HI> was to be courted by all the Artifices imaginable, and that was &s;o alarm'd by the Fleet's being in the River, and by the &s;eizure of &s;o many of their Ships, e&s;pecially the Cloath Ship, that there was a general con&s;ternation among&s;t the People: and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen applied them&s;elves to the Parliament, for leave to &s;end down &s;ome Agents to the Fleet to procure a relea&s;e of that Ship; and if that could not be brought to pa&s;s, that they might buy it at as good rate as they could get it. Which was the introducing &s;uch a Commerce and Corre&s;pondence between the Fleet and the City, in &s;uch a con|juncture <MILESTONE N="50"> of jealou&s;y, that mo&s;t Men believ'd the Parliament would ne|ver have hearken'd to it; and concluded, from their granting it, that there was another &s;ort of Trea&s;ure inclo&s;ed in that Ship, than what
<PB N="122" REF="1420">
belonged to the Merchant Adventurers; and that many of tho&s;e who granted that indulgence to the City, had more Money on board that Ve&s;&s;el than the Cloath was worth, though the value thereof amounted to no le&s;s than forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>UPON this liberty granted by the Parliament, a Committee was &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent to the Prince from the City with a Petition.</NOTE> from the City with a Petition to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> <Q>&startq;that he would&endq; re&s;tore the Ship which belonged to his Father's good Subjects.</Q> With the&s;e Men came Letters from &s;ome of tho&s;e who were well known to be very &s;ollicitous at that time for the advancement of the King's Service, and privy to the Treaty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and whatever was intended by <MILESTONE N="10"> the Earl of <HI>Holland:</HI> The Counte&s;s of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> who was tru&s;ted by all that People, and had gotten again confidence with the Queen, tru&s;ted M^r <HI>Lowe,</HI> who was imployed by the City in this Negotiation, to &s;ay many things to the Prince of the good inclinations of the City, and how nece&s;&s;ary it was not to irritate it. And he brought other Letters, and Te&s;timonies to give him credit, as a Man tru&s;ted by all who intended to &s;erve the King, who had with wonderful Addre&s;s got him to be one of tho&s;e imployed by the City, that he might, under that &s;ecurity, give &s;uch animadver&s;ions to the Prince, and to his Council, as was nece&s;&s;ary. He was a Man intelligent enough of the &s;pirit and humour of the City, <MILESTONE N="20"> and very conver&s;ant with the Nobility and Gentry about the Town; and though he was tru&s;ted by the Presbyterian Party, as a Man entirely addicted to Them, he took pains to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into many of the King's Party, which did believe him fit to be tru&s;ted in any thing that might concern them. But he was a Man of &s;o voluble a Tongue, and &s;o everla&s;ting a Talker, and &s;o undertaking and vain, that no &s;ober Man could be impo&s;ed upon by him.</P>
<P>UPON the receipt of this Petition, the Prince writ a long Letter to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince writes to the City.</NOTE> the City, and inclo&s;ed in it a Declaration, for the publi&s;hing of both which in print care was taken, the &s;ub&s;tance of which was, <Q>&startq;the great&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> affection he bore to the City, and the pro&s;perity thereof;</Q> the whole being in &s;uch a Style as might be&s;t plea&s;e the Presbyterians, with le&s;s care than &s;hould have been u&s;ed to pre&s;erve the Zeal of the King's Party; and de&s;iring <Q>&startq;that they would joyn with him for the delivery of the King his Father out of Pri&s;on, and to make a good under&s;tanding be|tween&endq; his Maje&s;ty and the Parliament, which his Highne&s;s de&s;ired with all imaginable concernment.</Q> The Citizens quickly found, that there was no hope to have their Ship relea&s;ed without a good Sum of Money, which the Prince told them <Q>&startq;was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the payment of the Seamen, and he would receive it as a loan from them, and re|pay&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> it when a Peace &s;hould be made.</Q> So &s;ome of them return'd to <HI>London,</HI> and the re&s;t remain'd with the Fleet, coming and going for a Month, and driving many bargains for other Ships. By this means the Prince receiv'd adverti&s;ement of the <HI>Scots</HI> continuing their march, and that tho&s;e who were inclo&s;ed in <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> were in a very good condi|tion, and willing to expect relief; which they would be &s;ure to receive in due time, the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> being ready to declare a&s;&s;oon as their pre&s;&s;ures &s;hould require it. After near a Months negotiation, there was about twelve thou&s;and pounds paid to the Prince, and thereupon that Cloath Ship was deliver'd to the Merchants, with a general opinion, <MILESTONE N="50"> as hath been &s;aid, that there was &s;omewhat el&s;e be&s;ides Cloath in the Body of it; for which there was not any Search &s;uffer'd to be made.</P>
<P>WHILST the Prince lay in the <HI>Downs,</HI> there was an Enterpri&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="1430">
nece&s;&s;ary to be made on Shore, which did not &s;ucceed to wi&s;h. Upon the fir&s;t revolt of the Fleet from the Parliament, and before it &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Holland,</HI> it had taken one or two of tho&s;e Block-Hou&s;es, or Ca&s;tles, which are neare&s;t the Downs; and had left &s;ome Seamen in them, with &s;ufficient Provi&s;ions to defend them&s;elves till the Fleet &s;hould return. The Prince found the&s;e Block-Hou&s;es be&s;ieged, and receiv'd Intelligence out of them, that their Provi&s;ions were &s;o near &s;pent, that they could not hold out above &s;o many days. The &s;trength that lay before them, con&s;i&s;ted more in Hor&s;e than Foot; and at high Tyde the Boats might go &s;o near, that there &s;eem'd little difficulty of putting in relief, or to <MILESTONE N="10"> compel the Be&s;iegers to ri&s;e: and the Seamen, having nothing el&s;e to do, offer'd to undertake the Service for the redemption of their fellows; many Land Officers being likewi&s;e on board, and &s;ome Foot Soldiers, the Prince &s;ent &s;ome of tho&s;e with the Seamen to undertake the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but it had no good i&s;&s;ue; the Tyde was too far &s;pent before it be|gun; whereby they had more ground to march between their landing and the Ca&s;tle than they imagined, and the Hor&s;e charged them with &s;uch re&s;olution, that many of the Men were killed, and more taken Pri|&s;oners, and the re&s;t forced to their Boats with more di&s;order than be|came them. And &s;ome other attempts being afterwards made with no <MILESTONE N="20"> better &s;ucce&s;s, the Block-Hou&s;es at la&s;t came into the hands of the Ene|my; which, though of little inconvenience to the Prince, tho&s;e Forts being of very &s;mall importance to do any prejudice, yet there was &s;ome di&s;reputation in it; and it di&s;credited the de&s;igns, which had not yet appear'd very pro&s;perous in any place; and any acce&s;s of good Fortune rai&s;ed the Spirits of the Parliament's Party, who ea&s;ily were per&s;waded to think it greater than it was, in a time when they lay under &s;ome Mortification.</P>
<P>BY this time another Fleet was prepared by the Parliament of more <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment prepares a Fleet again&s;t the Revolted Fleet, under Command of the Earl of</HI> Warwick.</NOTE> and better Ships than had revolted, and the Command thereof given <MILESTONE N="30"> to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> who very frankly accepted it; and was already on board, and with the Tyde was come within &s;ight of the Prince; and there dropped Anchor. So that both Fleets lay within that di&s;tance of each other, that there was now nothing thought of but a Battle; to which there &s;eem'd all alacrity in the Prince's Fleet; and, it may be, the more upon the Intelligence that the other was not well mann'd, and that many were put on board who had more affection for the King; which they would manife&s;t when they came within di&s;tance: but whe|ther that fancy was from imagination or intelligence, it &s;eem'd to have no foundation in truth. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and his Fleet appear'd re&s;olute and prepared enough for an Engagement: yet it was well known, that the Earl was privy to the Engagement of his Brother the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and had promi&s;ed to joyn with him. And therefore it was thought fit, that the Prince &s;hould write to the Earl to &s;ummon, or invite him to return to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince writes to the Earl of</HI> War|wick. <HI>His An&s;wer.</HI></NOTE> his Allegiance. This was &s;ent by <HI>Harry Seymour,</HI> who quickly return'd with an An&s;wer from the Earl, which, in terms of Duty enough, hum|bly be&s;ought his Highne&s;s <Q>&startq;to put him&s;elf into the hands of the Par|liament; and that the Fleet with him might &s;ubmit to their obe|dience;&endq; upon which they &s;hould be pardoned for their Revolt.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THOUGH this might well have &s;atisfied concerning the Earl's incli|nation, yet the Prince was prevailed with that M&punc; <HI>Crofts</HI> might give the Earl a vi&s;it; who, having more acquaintance with him, having married
<PB N="124" REF="1440">
his Aunt, might be able to get a private Audience of the Earl; which <HI>Seymour</HI> endeavour'd, but could not obtain. But <HI>Crofts</HI> return'd as the other did; and now there wanted only a Wind to bring them together, which coming fair for the Prince, he re&s;olv'd to attack them. All An|chors were weighed, and preparations made to advance to the A&s;&s;ault, the whole Fleet being under Sail towards the other; which &s;eem'd equal|ly re&s;olv'd and di&s;po&s;ed, though the Wind, which drove the Prince upon them, compelled them a little to retire, where the River was &s;omewhat narrower. In an in&s;tant the Wind cea&s;ed, and there was a calm; &s;o that the Prince could not advance; and &s;ome doubts aro&s;e, upon the <MILESTONE N="10"> narrowing of the River, as if &s;ome of his Ships might want Water in the Engagement. In this deliberation the Wind ro&s;e again, but from another Quarter, which was directly in the Prince's face; and would not &s;uffer him to move towards the Enemy, but drove him back, and would carry him out of the River. Hereupon were new con&s;ultations; great want of Provi&s;ions was di&s;cover'd to be in the Fleet, in&s;omuch as that they &s;hould not be able to &s;tay at Sea above ten days, and many Ships would want &s;ooner, and therefore &s;ince the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> as the Wind &s;tood, could not be compelled to Fight, and they were in dan|ger to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for Provi&s;ions, it was thought mo&s;t coun&s;elable to <MILESTONE N="20"> put to Sea; where they could more commodiou&s;ly engage in a Battle, if the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> would advance; and if he did not, there was great rea&s;on to hope, that the Prince might meet with tho&s;e Ships which were coming from <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> to joyn with the Earl, and which might ea&s;ily be &s;urpri&s;ed or taken by the Prince's Fleet; which was much &s;u|perior to them in &s;trength.</P>
<P>AT this time the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> arrived in a Ship from <HI>Scot|land;</HI> and having left Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> upon his march towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> he was &s;ent to demand the performance of the Treaty, and that the Prince would immediately repair to that Army. This confirm'd the <MILESTONE N="30"> Prince in the purpo&s;e of putting out to Sea, &s;ince it was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to carry the Fleet fir&s;t into <HI>Holland,</HI> before it could tran&s;port him into the Northern parts. So the whole Fleet went to Sea, and con|tinued <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince went to Sea towards</HI> Hol|land, <HI>after having at|tempted to Fight the Earl of</HI> War|wick.</NOTE> their cour&s;e for <HI>Holland,</HI> with hope &s;till to meet with tho&s;e Ships which were coming from <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> And meet with them they did in the Night; which the Prince knew not till the Morning; when one put the fault upon another; and it was now nece&s;&s;ary to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;ince by the conjunction with the&s;e Ships, be|&s;ides all other Advantages, the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was now become &s;u|perior in the number, as well as the &s;trength and goodne&s;s of his Ships; <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Warwick <HI>fol|lows him to|wards</HI> Hol|land.</NOTE> which appear'd by his coming before <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> within few days after the Prince's arrival there.</P>
<P>IT was near the middle of <HI>July,</HI> when Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> enter'd into <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil|ton <HI>enters</HI> England <HI>a|bout the mid|dle of</HI> July.</NOTE> <HI>England</HI> with his Army, when he came to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and immediately took that Government from S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave,</HI> and drew out all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on, and put <HI>Scots</HI> in their place. And after &s;ome few days &s;tay there, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Forces met at a Rendezvous, in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke's march.</NOTE> way to that part of <HI>Cumberland</HI> where <HI>Lambert</HI> then Quarter'd: and if they had continued their March, as they ought to have done, it is very probable they had broken that Body of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s. But the Duke <MILESTONE N="50"> would Quarter that Night two Miles &s;hort; and <HI>Lambert,</HI> in the &s;ame Night, marched from thence in great di&s;order and confu&s;ion to the edge of <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> The Duke re&s;ted many days, that all his Forces might

come up, which came &s;lowly out of <HI>Scotland.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as they were come up, he marched to <HI>Kendal;</HI> where he re&s;ted again &s;everal days; the rea|&s;on whereof no body could imagin. It was &s;u&s;pected it was that tho&s;e Forces which were up in &s;everal parts of the Kingdom for the King, might undergo &s;ome defeat, that they might not be &s;o united, as to controle or ob&s;truct the Presbyterian de&s;ign. For after that Army was enter'd into <HI>England,</HI> it moved, as hath been &s;aid, by &s;uch very &s;low marches, and &s;o negligently, and with &s;o little apprehen&s;ion of an Ene|my, and it was Quarter'd at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that the head Quarter was very often twenty Miles di&s;tant from &s;ome part of the Army; the <MILESTONE N="10"> Duke him&s;elf performing no part of the office of a General, but taking his ea&s;e, and being wholely govern'd by the Lieutenant General of the Army, and two or three other Officers.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> marched, with his Body of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> M. Lang|dale <HI>a day be|fore him.</HI></NOTE> of near four thou&s;and Foot, and &s;even or eight hundred Hor&s;e, allways a day before the Army; by which they intended to have timely adverti&s;ement of the Enemies motion, and likewi&s;e meant that he &s;hould bear the fir&s;t brunt of them, de&s;iring to weaken him by all the ways they could. They had not marched many days, it being now near the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> adverti&s;ed the Duke, <MILESTONE N="20"> by an Expre&s;s, <Q>&startq;that he had receiv'd unque&s;tionable Intelligence that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was within two or three days march, and re&s;olv'd to engage his Army a&s;&s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly he could, and that he would not be di|verted from it, by the People's gathering together at any di&s;tance from&endq; him, in what po&s;ture &s;oever;</Q> <Q>and therefore de&s;ired his Grace, &startq;that he would keep his Army clo&s;e together; for they could not be far&endq; a&s;under with any &s;ecurity;</Q> <Q>and declared; &startq;that he him&s;elf would re&s;t, and wait the advance of the Enemy, and then retire back as he &s;hould&endq; find it nece&s;&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P>THE Duke, notwith&s;tanding this adverti&s;ement, reformed not the <MILESTONE N="30"> Order of his March in any degree, but was per&s;waded <Q>&startq;that the Enemy could not be &s;o near; and that, if <HI>Cromwell</HI> was advanced to &s;uch a di&s;tance, it was only with &s;uch a Party, as he would not pre&s;ume to&endq; engage with their whole Army.</Q> In this confidence, he marched as he had done before. S^r <HI>Marmaduke</HI> &s;ent him every day advice that con|firm'd the former, <Q>&startq;and that his Hor&s;e had encounter'd &s;ome of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> M. Lang|dale <HI>gives him an Account of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> Enemy, and that their whole Body was at hand; but that it was true, it was not a Body equal in number to their Army, yet all that <HI>Crom|well&endq;</HI> expected was to joyn Battle with him.</Q> All this gain'd not credit, till S^r <HI>Marmaduke</HI> him&s;elf, making his retreat with very &s;harp Skir|mi&s;hes, <MILESTONE N="40"> in which many Men fell on both &s;ides, was pur&s;ued into the head Quarters of the Duke; whither he likewi&s;e brought with him &s;ome Pri&s;oners, who averr'd, that the whole Body of the Army was within five or &s;ix Miles, and marched as fa&s;t as they were able.</P>
<P>THE Duke was confounded with the Intelligence, and knew not what to do: the Army was not together; and that part that was about him, was without any order, and made no &s;hew of any purpo&s;e to Fight. In this amazement, the Duke &s;tayed him&s;elf with &s;ome Officers at <HI>Pre&s;ton;</HI> and cau&s;ed his Foot to be drawn over a Bridge, that they might march towards <HI>Wiggan,</HI> a Town in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> where he &s;hould, <MILESTONE N="50"> as he thought, find &s;ome Regiments, and where they might make &s;ome &s;tand till the re&s;t &s;hould come up. In the mean time S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> return'd to his Troops, the Duke having promi&s;ed to &s;end him
<PB N="126" REF="1460">
&s;ome Troops to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and that &s;ome Foot &s;hould be &s;ent to keep a Lane, that would Flank his Men upon his retreat. S^r <HI>Marmaduke</HI> retired before the Enemy, and drew up his Troops into the Clo&s;es near <HI>Pre&s;ton.</HI> The Enemy followed him clo&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ed him very hard; notwith|&s;tanding which he maintain'd the di&s;pute for above &s;ix hours with great Courage, and with very great lo&s;s to the Enemy in Officers, and Com|mon Soldiers; in&s;omuch as they &s;eem'd to retire, at lea&s;t to make a &s;tand. And in all this time the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ent him no A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but concluded that it was not <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s whole Army that a&s;&s;aulted him, but only &s;ome Party, which he would him&s;elf be well enough able to di&s;engage him|&s;elf <MILESTONE N="10"> from. <Q>And S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> told me often afterwards, &startq;that he verily believ'd, if one thou&s;and Foot had then been &s;ent to him, he &s;hould have gained the day: and <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf acknowledged,&endq; that he never &s;aw Foot Fight &s;o de&s;perately as They did.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> continued their march over the Bridge, without taking <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> M. Lang|dale <HI>Fights, and is beaten; and Duke</HI> Ha|milton <HI>routed.</HI></NOTE> care to &s;ecure the Lane, which he had recommended to them; by which <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Hor&s;e came upon his Flank, whil&s;t he was equally pre&s;&s;ed in the Van. So that his excellent Body of Foot being broken, S^r <HI>Mar|maduke,</HI> and &s;uch of his Hor&s;e as kept together, were driven into the Town; where the Duke remain'd yet with &s;ome Officers; who all re|treated <MILESTONE N="20"> over a Ford to the Foot, who were in equal di&s;order. For a&s;|&s;oon as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces were broken, the <HI>Scots</HI> were pre&s;ently beaten from the Bridge, and forced to a very di&s;orderly march. However, the Duke had &s;till a great part of his own Army together; with which he continued to march two or three days to <HI>Wiggan;</HI> thence, to <HI>Warring|ton;</HI> where <HI>Baily</HI> capitulated, and deliver'd up all the Foot; thence to <HI>Nantwich,</HI> and at la&s;t to <HI>Uxeter;</HI> and in all that time many of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Noblemen for&s;ook him, and render'd them&s;elves Pri&s;oners to the Gentlemen of the Country; and <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Troops under <HI>Lambert,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard upon the Rear, that they killed, and took as many Pri|&s;oners <MILESTONE N="30"> as they plea&s;ed, without hazarding their own Men. The Duke was &s;carce got into <HI>Uxeter,</HI> when his Troops, which made no re&s;i&s;tance, were beaten in upon him, and &s;o clo&s;e pur&s;ued by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Hor&s;e under <HI>Lambert,</HI> that him&s;elf and all the principal Officers (&s;ome few excepted, who, lying concealed, or by the benefit of the &s;wiftne&s;s of their Hor&s;es, made their e&s;cape) were taken Pri&s;oners: the Duke nei|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke taken.</NOTE> behaving him&s;elf like a General, nor with that Courage which he was before never thought to want; but making all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, and all excu&s;es to tho&s;e who took him.</P>
<P>THUS his whole Army was routed, and defeated; more killed out <MILESTONE N="40"> of contempt, than that they de&s;erv'd it by any oppo&s;ition; the re&s;t taken Pri&s;oners, all their Cannon and Baggage taken, and their Colours; only &s;ome of their Hor&s;e, which had been Quarter'd mo&s;t backward, made ha&s;t to carry news to their Country of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their Armes. They who did not take the way for <HI>Scotland,</HI> were for the mo&s;t part taken by the activity of the Country, or the Hor&s;e that pur|&s;ued them; whereof S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> after he had made his way with &s;ome of his Officers and Soldiers, who &s;tood with him till they found it &s;afe&s;t to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves, had the ill Fortune to be di&s;cover'd; and was &s;o taken Pri&s;oner, and &s;ent to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Not|tingham.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> M.

Victory, after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces under <HI>Langdale</HI> had been defeated.</P>
<P>IT may be proper now to mention, that the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had many mi&s;adventures; which de|tain'd them from attending upon the Prince in the Fleet. A&s;&s;oon as they heard that his Highne&s;s had put him&s;elf on board a Ship at <HI>Calais</HI> to find the Fleet in <HI>Holland,</HI> they embarked at <HI>Diepe,</HI> in a <HI>French</HI> Man of War that was bound for <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> <Q>where when they arriv'd, they found a Gentleman, a Servant of the Prince's, who inform'd them, &startq;that the Prince was with the whole Fleet in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and that he had &s;ent him with a Letter to the Mar&s;hal <HI>Ranzaw,</HI> who was Gover|nour&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> to borrow a Frigat of him;</Q> which he had there, and had by &s;ome civil Me&s;&s;age offer'd to lend to his Highne&s;s; and the Mar&s;hal, who receiv'd them with great civillity, a&s;&s;ured them that the Frigat &s;hould be ready the next day, and if they plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of it, &s;hould carry them to the Prince.</P>
<P>THEY looked upon it as a good opportunity, which would deliver them much &s;ooner at the Fleet, than they had before expected to be; and &s;o, without weighing the Dangers which might accompany it, and might very naturally have been fore&s;een, they embraced the occa&s;ion; there being no hazard which they apprehended at Sea, but that they <MILESTONE N="20"> might be taken by the Parliament Ships; which, by the Prince's being with his Fleet in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and &s;o being Ma&s;ter at Sea, was hardly po&s;&s;ible. So they unwarily put them&s;elves into that Frigat, and &s;et Sail in the Evening from <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> pre&s;uming that they &s;hould, the next Morning, find them&s;elves in the <HI>Downs</HI> with the Prince. But there was &s;o dead a calm that Night, that they made very little way; and, the next Morning, they found that they were cha&s;ed by &s;ix or &s;even Frigats of <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> In &s;hort, they were taken Pri&s;oners, and plunder'd of all they had (which amounted to good value in Jewels and Money) and were carried into <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> where, though they were pre&s;ently at liberty, they <MILESTONE N="30"> were compelled to &s;tay many days not without &s;ome hope, rai&s;ed by the civility of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governour, and the Lords of the Admiralty there, who very liberally promi&s;ed an entire re&s;titution of all that they had lo&s;t. But that being without any effect, that bruti&s;h People, the Freebooters, being &s;ubject to no Government, they found means to give notice to the Prince of all that happen'd, and that they would attend his Command at <HI>Flu&s;hing;</HI> whither they ea&s;ily went. Within few days af|ter, the Prince, out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> &s;ent a Frigat for them to Flu&s;hing; where they embarked &s;everal times, and were at Sea the whole Night, and in the Morning driven back by high Winds, &s;ometimes into <HI>Flu&s;h|ing,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ometimes to <HI>Ramikins;</HI> and &s;o were compelled to go to <HI>Middle|borough;</HI> and after a Months &s;tay in tho&s;e places, and many attempts to get to Sea, they receiv'd Order from the Prince to attend him in <HI>Holland,</HI> whither he had re&s;olv'd to go, a&s;&s;oon as the Earl of <HI>Lauther|dale</HI> arrived from <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Fleet, and had deliver'd his imperious invitation for the Prince's immediate repair to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; which was then enter'd into <HI>England.</HI> By this means they came not to the Prince, till the next day after he came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> having left <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince comes to the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> the Fleet before <HI>Goree</HI> and near <HI>Helvoet Sluce.</HI></P>
<P>THE Prince was receiv'd by the States with all outward re&s;pect, and <MILESTONE N="50"> treated by them for four or five days at their charge; his Royal High|ne&s;s every Night lodging in the Palace, which belonged to the States too, where the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Prince&s;s lay, and where both
<PB N="128" REF="1480">
his Royal Highne&s;s and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had very good apartments; the Prince and Duke, after two or three days, allways eating with the Prince&s;s Royal, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> him&s;elf keeping his own Table open, according to cu&s;tom, for the re&s;ort of &s;uch of the States, or Of|ficers of the Army, or other Noble Per&s;ons, who frequently repaired thither.</P>
<P>THE Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Court was full of Faction, and Animo&s;ity <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Divi&s;ions among the Prince of</HI> Wales<HI>'s Court.</HI></NOTE> again&s;t each other, &s;o that the new comers were not only very well re|ceiv'd by the Prince, but very welcome to every Body, who being an|gry with the other Coun&s;ellors there, believ'd that matters would be bet|ter <MILESTONE N="10"> carried now They were come. They had not been an hour in the <HI>Hague,</HI> when <HI>Herbert</HI> the Atturney General came to them, and con|gratulated their arrival, and told them <Q>&startq;how much they had been want|ed,&endq; and how much Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> longed for their Company.</Q> And within a very &s;hort time after, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> him&s;elf came to bid them welcome, with all po&s;&s;ible grace, and profe&s;&s;ion of great kindne&s;s and e&s;teem for them. They both inveighed bitterly again&s;t the whole admi|ni&s;tration of the Fleet, in which mo&s;t part of the Court, which had been pre&s;ent, and who agreed in nothing el&s;e, concurr'd with them.</P>
<P>THE whole clamour was again&s;t the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and S^r <HI>Robert</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Long</HI> the Prince's Secretary, who, by the Queen's injunction, was wholely &s;ub&s;ervient to the Lord <HI>Colepepper.</HI> They accu&s;ed them of corruption, not only with reference to the Cloath Ship, but to the relea&s;e of very many other Ships, which they had di&s;charged upon no other rea&s;on, but as it would be a very Popular thing, and make the Prince grateful to the City of <HI>London.</HI> Though there was much di&s;cour&s;e of Money brought to both their Cabins by M^r <HI>Lowe,</HI> yet there was never any proof made of any corruption in the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who was not indeed to be wrought upon that way; but, having &s;ome infirmities, and a multi|tude of Enemies, he was never ab&s;olv'd from any thing of which any <MILESTONE N="30"> Man accu&s;ed him; and the other was &s;o notoriou&s;ly inclined to that way of Husbandry, that he was allways thought guilty of more than he was charged with. It was true enough that great Riches were parted with, and had been relea&s;ed for little or no Money; which being now exceedingly wanted, made it ea&s;ily believ'd that &s;uch unthrifty Coun&s;el could not have been given, except by tho&s;e who were well rewarded for it; which &s;till fell upon tho&s;e two.</P>
<P>THERE was a general murmur that the Fleet had lain &s;o long idle at the mouth of the River, when it had been propo&s;ed that it might go to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> where they might, in the con&s;ternation the whole <MILESTONE N="40"> Kingdom was then in, probably have been able to have relea&s;ed the King; <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> being near the Sea, a Ca&s;tle not &s;trong in it &s;elf, the I&s;land well affected, and at that time under no &s;uch power as could &s;ub|due them. And why &s;uch an attempt, which, if un&s;ucce&s;sful, could have been attended with no damage con&s;iderable, was not made, was never fully an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>THEY were very angry with <HI>Batten,</HI> and would have it Treachery in him, that the two Fleets did not Fight with each other, when they were &s;o near engaging in the River; which, they &s;aid, they might well have done before the Wind changed, if he had not di&s;&s;waded the Prince; <MILESTONE N="50"> and in this the clamour of the Seamen joyn'd with them. But it was but clamour, for mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Men gave him a good Te&s;timony in that affair, and that he behaved him&s;elf like a skilful Officer, and was
<PB N="129" REF="1490">
very forward to Fight whil&s;t there was rea&s;on to effect it. The other reproach upon him of pa&s;&s;ing by the Ships which came from <HI>Port&s;|mouth,</HI> in the Night, was not &s;o well An&s;wer'd: for it was known, though he &s;aid that they were pa&s;&s;ed by, and out of reach before he was inform'd of them, that he had notice time enough to have engaged them, and did decline it; which might rea&s;onably enough have been done, out of apprehen&s;ion, be&s;ides the inconvenience of a Night En|gagement, that the noi&s;e of the conflict might have called the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> out of the River to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, before they could have ma&s;ter'd them; there being two or three of the be&s;t Ships of the Royal <MILESTONE N="10"> Navy, which would have made a very notable re&s;i&s;tance. But this be|ing never urged by him&s;elf, and what would have been too much for him to have taken upon him&s;elf, it was imputed to his Cowardize, of which the Seamen, as well as the Courtiers, accu&s;ed him; though, as was generally thought, without rea&s;on, and only with prejudice to the Man for what he had done before, and becau&s;e he was a Man of a re|gular and orderly cour&s;e of Life, and Command, and of very few words, and le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion than at that time rai&s;ed Men to reputation in that Pro|vince. There was only one Man in the Council of whom no body &s;poke ill, nor laid any thing to his Charge; and that was the Lord <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Hopton.</HI> But there was then &s;uch a combination, by the countenance of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with all the other Lords of the Court, and the At|turney General, upon former grudges, to undervalue him, that they had drawn the Prince him&s;elf to have a le&s;s e&s;teem of him than his &s;in|gular Virtue, and Fidelity, and his unque&s;tionable Courage, and In|du&s;try (all which his Enemies could not deny that he excelled in) did de&s;erve.</P>
<P>THIS State the Court was in, when the two lately mention'd Coun|&s;ellors came; who quickly di&s;cern'd, by the un&s;teady humours, and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions all Men were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, that they &s;hould not pre|&s;erve <MILESTONE N="30"> the reputation they &s;eem'd to have with every Body for the pre|&s;ent, any long time, and fore&s;aw that nece&s;&s;ity would pre&s;ently break in upon them like an armed Man, that would di&s;turb and di&s;tract all their Coun&s;els. And there was, even at the in&s;tant in which they ar|riv'd at the <HI>Hague,</HI> the fatal adverti&s;ement of that defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which mu&s;t break all their mea&s;ures, and render the condition of the Prince, and of the whole Kingdom, very deplorable, and leave that of the King his Father in the utmo&s;t de&s;pair.</P>
<P>THE Rumour of this defeat came to the <HI>Hague</HI> the next day after the Prince came thither, but not &s;o particularly that the extent of it <MILESTONE N="40"> was known, or the tragical effects yet throughly under&s;tood. And his Highne&s;s appointing his Council to meet together the next Morning after the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer came thither, he inform'd them of the Lord <HI>Lautherdale</HI>'s Me&s;&s;age to him from the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that he very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed him, even &s;ince the news of the defeat, that he would forthwith repair to their Army; and his Highne&s;s thought fit, that the Earl &s;hould give an Account of his Commi&s;&s;ion at the Board; whereupon he was &s;ent for in; and, that all re&s;pect might be &s;hewed to the Parliament of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> he had a Chair allow'd him to &s;it upon. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>

their native, and con&s;tant Affection and Duty to their King, and find|ing that, contrary to the Duty of Subjects, his Maje&s;ty was impri&s;on'd by the Traiterous and Rebellious Army in <HI>England,</HI> they had rai&s;ed an Army in that Kingdom, that, &s;ince their advice, coun&s;el, and en|treaty in an amicable way, could not prevail, might by force redeem his Maje&s;ties Per&s;on from that captivity; which they held them&s;elves obliged by their &s;olemn League and Covenant to endeavour to do, with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes: That this Army was al|ready enter'd into <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of <HI>James</HI> Duke <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> whom, in re&s;pect of his known and eminent fidelity to his <MILESTONE N="10"> Maje&s;ty, they had made General thereof; and having now done all that was in their power to do for the pre&s;ent, and having taken due care for the &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply and recruit of that Army, they now &s;ent to his Highne&s;s, that he would with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, according to the promi&s;e which the King his Father had made, tran&s;port his Royal Per&s;on, that he might him&s;elf be in the head of that Army to obtain&endq; the Liberty of his Father;</Q> and they de&s;ired him, <Q>&startq;that for the cir|cum&s;tances of his Journey he would be advi&s;ed by the Earl of <HI>Lauther|dale,&endq;</HI> to whom they had given full In&s;tructions;</Q> and they be&s;ought his Highne&s;s <Q>&startq;&endq;to give credit to him in all things.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE Earl likewi&s;e &s;hew'd his In&s;tructions, by which none of the Prince's Chaplains were to be admitted to attend him, and great care to be taken, that none but <HI>Godly</HI> Men &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to be about the Per&s;on of his Highne&s;s; and particularly that neither Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> nor the Chancellor of the Exchequer, nor &s;ome other Per&s;ons &s;hould be admitted to go with the Prince. And after all the&s;e things were read and enlarged upon, he pre&s;&s;ed the Prince, with all imaginable in&s;tance, and without taking notice of any thing that was befallen their Army in <HI>England,</HI> of which he could not but have had particular relation, that he would lo&s;e no time from entring upon his Journey; and all this <MILESTONE N="30"> with as in&s;olent, and &s;upercilious behaviour, as if their Army had been triumphant.</P>
<P>WHEN he had &s;aid all he meant to &s;ay, he &s;ate &s;till, as if he expected to hear what the Prince or any Body el&s;e would &s;ay to what he propo&s;ed.

treated, and debated by, or before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Board; nor did he con|&s;ider what was, or &s;hould be &s;aid, by any Man but the Prince him|&s;elf.&endq;</Q> <Q>The Prince told him, &startq;it was nece&s;&s;ary that he him&s;elf &s;hould hear, and know what the opinion of the Council &s;hould be; and that&endq; it was as unrea&s;onable that He &s;hould be pre&s;ent;</Q> and thereupon com|manded him to withdraw; which he pre&s;ently &s;ubmitted to with inde|cency enough. <Q>The Prince then told them, &startq;that there were &s;ome Per&s;ons come to the Town, the la&s;t night, who came out of <HI>England</HI> after the News of the Victory over the <HI>Scots</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> with&endq; all the circum&s;tances thereof;</Q> and of the Duke's being taken Pri&s;oner; <MILESTONE N="10"> and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had told him, <Q>&startq;that the States had re|ceiv'd Intelligence of it from their Emba&s;&s;adour <HI>Newport,</HI> who re&s;ided&endq; in <HI>London.</HI></Q> <Q>Upon the whole matter, the Prince re&s;olv'd &startq;to meet again the next morning to con&s;ult farther what he was to do, and that probably, in the mean time, the Intelligence would be more perfect, and unque&s;tionable, and they &s;hould &s;ee whether <HI>Lautherdale</HI> would&endq; take any notice of it.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the night made no alteration in him; he appeared the next morning with the &s;ame confidence, and the &s;ame importunity for the Prince to remove, and begin his Journey. <Q>He was asked, &startq;whether he <MILESTONE N="20"> had receiv'd no information of &s;ome ill fortune, that had befallen that Army, which might &s;o change the ca&s;e &s;ince he left <HI>Scotland,</HI> that what&endq; might Then have been fit, would be Now unfit and uncoun&s;elable?</Q> <Q>The Earl &s;aid, &startq;he knew well what the News was from <HI>England;</HI> and, whatever he hoped, that he was not confident it was not true; how|ever he hoped, that would not change the Prince's purpo&s;e, but that it would more concern him to pur&s;ue the re&s;olution he was formerly obliged to: that if any misfortune had befallen that Army, the Prince had the more rea&s;on to endeavour to repair it; which could be done no other way, than by his making all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t into <HI>Scotland;</HI> which <MILESTONE N="30"> remain'd &s;till a Kingdom entire, wholely devoted to his Service; and that, by the benefit of his pre&s;ence, might quickly draw together an|other Army, towards which there was a good beginning already by the pre&s;ervation of that Body under <HI>Monroe:</HI> that if his Highne&s;s &s;hould decline this only probable way to pre&s;erve him&s;elf, and to re|cover his other two Kingdoms, it would be thought he had little zeal for the Liberty of his Father, and as little for his own Intere&s;t, and for the pre&s;ervation of the Crown; he therefore be&s;ought his High|ne&s;s, that he would cau&s;e &s;ome of his Ships to be forthwith made ready, and would therein immediately tran&s;port him&s;elf into <HI>Scotland;</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> whereby the late wound would, in a &s;hort time, be healed; which&endq; would otherwi&s;e prove incurable.</Q></P>
<P>BUT <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;o well known, and the power of <HI>Argyle</HI> (which mu&s;t be now greater than ever by the total defeat of the contrary Par|ty) that his Propo&s;ition was by all di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Men thought to be very extravagant, and not to be hearken'd to: and the news from <HI>London,</HI> that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was marched into <HI>Scotland</HI> with his whole Army, con|firm'd every hone&s;t Man in that opinion. And within few days the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> &s;eem'd rather to think of going thither him&s;elf, where his own concernments were in great danger, than of pre&s;&s;ing the Prince <MILESTONE N="50"> to &s;o hazardous a Voyage; and after a few Weeks more &s;tay at the <HI>Hague,</HI> upon the Intelligence from his Friends in <HI>Scotland,</HI> how affairs went <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Lautherdale <HI>returns into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> there, he return'd thither in the &s;ame Ship that tran&s;ported him from

<P>THE Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> though it was not at fir&s;t believ'd to be an entire Victory over their whole Body, there being dou|ble that number that was not there or that marched from thence, broke or di&s;appointed mo&s;t of the de&s;igns which were on Foot for rai&s;ing Men, in tho&s;e Northern Counties, for the King's Service, to have joyn'd and united under S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale.</HI> S^r <HI>Thomas Tilde&s;ly,</HI> a Gentle|man of a fair E&s;tate, who had &s;erv'd the King from the beginning of the War with good Courage, was then with a Body of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with which he had Be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and was upon the point of reducing it, when the News of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> arriv'd. It was then nece&s;&s;ary to quit that de&s;ign; and hearing that Major General <HI>Monroe,</HI> who, &s;hortly after the Duke, marched out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> followed him with a Recruit of above &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, was come to the skirts of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> he retired thither to him, having gather'd up many of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Tho.

<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> marched into the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> to joyn with &s;uch new Levies as were then rai&s;ing there; and their Number being encrea&s;ed by the addition of tho&s;e Troops which were under the Com|mand of S^r <HI>Henry Bellingham,</HI> they met again Major General <HI>Monroe</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and de&s;ired him <Q>&startq;that they might unite together <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monroe <HI>hav|ing enter'd</HI> England, <HI>upon</HI> Hamilton<HI>'s De&s;eat re|treats to|wards</HI> Scot|land.</NOTE> again&s;t the Common Enemy, who equally de&s;ired the de&s;truction of&endq; them both.</Q> But he re&s;olutely refu&s;ed, and told them plainly, <Q>&startq;that&endq; he would march directly into <HI>Scotland</HI> and expect Orders there;</Q> which he did, with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> believ'd that he and his Foot might be wel|come <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S</HI>^r Philip Mu&s;|grave <HI>to</HI> Car|li&s;le.</NOTE> to <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> and went thither; and &s;ent S^r <HI>Henry Bellingham,</HI> S^r <HI>Robert Strickland,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Chater,</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and offer'd that they &s;hould carry their Troops into <HI>Scotland</HI> to joyn with him; who he knew well would &s;tand in need of help.

<P>SIR <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> had no better &s;ucce&s;s with S^r <HI>William Leving|&s;ton,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> for though he receiv'd him very civilly, and enter'd into a Treaty with him (for he knew well enough that he was not able to Victual, or Defend the place without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of S^r <HI>Philip</HI> in both) yet when Articles were agreed upon, and &s;ign'd by S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave,</HI> the Governour fell back, <Q>and refu&s;ed to engage him&s;elf &startq;not to deliver up&endq; the Garri&s;on without the con&s;ent of S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave;</HI></Q> who was con|tented <MILESTONE N="10"> that none of his Men &s;hould come within the Walls, until it &s;hould be mo&s;t apparent, that they could no longer keep the Field.</P>
<P>WITHIN a &s;hort time after, Orders were &s;ent out of <HI>Scotland</HI> for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Berwick <HI>and</HI> Carli&s;le <HI>deli|ver'd to the Parliament.</HI></NOTE> the delivery of <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> to the Parliament; in which Or|ders there was not the lea&s;t mention of making conditions for the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> had yet <HI>Apleby</HI> Ca&s;tle in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, having taken it after he had deliver'd <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and after he was marched from thence. By this good accident, upon the delivery of it up, which could not long have made any defence, he made conditions for him&s;elf, and one hundred and fifty Officers, many of them Gentle|men <MILESTONE N="20"> of Quality, who liv'd again to venture, and &s;ome, to lo&s;e their Lives for the King: after which, he &s;oon tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>Holland,</HI></P>
<P>CROMWELL re&s;olv'd to lo&s;e no advantage he had got, but a&s;&s;oon as he had perfected his defeat of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> by gathering up as many Pri&s;oners, as he could, of the di&s;per&s;ed Troops, he marched directly towards <HI>Scotland,</HI> to pull up the Roots there, from which any farther trouble might &s;pring hereafter; though he was very earne&s;tly called upon from <HI>York&s;hire</HI> to reduce tho&s;e at <HI>Pontfret</HI> Ca&s;tle; which grew very trouble&s;ome to all their Neighbours; and, not &s;atisfied with drawing <MILESTONE N="30"> contributions from all the parts adjacent, they made excur&s;ions into places at a great di&s;tance, and took divers &s;ub&s;tantial Men Pri&s;oners, and carried them to the Ca&s;tle; where they remain'd till they redeem'd them|&s;elves by great ran&s;oms. However, he would not defer his Northern March; but, believing that he &s;hould be in a &s;hort time capable to take Vengeance upon tho&s;e Affronts, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf in &s;ending Colonel <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> with &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e and Foot, to re&s;train their adventures, and to keep them blocked up; and him&s;elf, with the re&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>marches into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> of his Army, continued their march for <HI>Scotland,</HI> it being about the end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> or beginning of <HI>September,</HI> before the Harve&s;t of that <MILESTONE N="40"> Country was yet ripe; and &s;o capable of being de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>IT was generally believ'd, that the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> earne&s;tly in|vited him to this Progre&s;s; for the defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army in <HI>England</HI> had not yet enough made him Ma&s;ter of <HI>Scotland.</HI> There was &s;till a Committee of Parliament &s;itting at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> in which, and in the Council, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI> &s;wayed without a Rival; and the Troops which had been rai&s;ed under <HI>Monroe</HI> for the Recruit of the Duke's Ar|my, were &s;till together, and at the Earl's devotion; &s;o that the Marquis was &s;till upon his good behaviour. If he did not invite <HI>Cromwell,</HI> he was very glad of his coming; and made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to bid him wel|come <MILESTONE N="50"> upon his entring into the Kingdom. They made great &s;hews of being mutually glad to &s;ee each other, being linked together by many promi&s;es, and profe&s;&s;ions, and by an entire conjunction in guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="1540">
THERE was no Act of Ho&s;tility committed; <Q><HI>Cromwell</HI> declaring, &startq;that he came with his Army to pre&s;erve the Godly Party, and to free the Kingdom from a force, which it was under, of Malignant Men, who had forced the Nation to break the Friend&s;hip with their Brethren of <HI>England,</HI> who had been &s;o faithful to them: That it having plea&s;ed God to defeat that Army under Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who endeavour'd to engage the two Nations in each others Blood, he was come thither to prevent any farther mi&s;chief, and to remove tho&s;e from Authority who had u&s;ed their Power &s;o ill; and that he hoped he &s;hould, in very few days, return with an a&s;&s;urance of the Brotherly Affection of that <MILESTONE N="10"> Kingdom to the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> which did not de&s;ire in any&endq; degree to invade their Liberties, or infringe their Privileges.</Q> He was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Is receiv'd at</HI> Edenborough.</NOTE> conducted to <HI>Edenborough</HI> by the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> where he was re|ceiv'd with all &s;olemnity, and the re&s;pect due to the Deliverer of their Country, and his Army Quarter'd about, and &s;upplied with all Provi|&s;ions the Country could yield.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and all the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction (that is all who had a mind to continue of it) were withdrawn, and out of reach; and they who remain'd at <HI>Edenborough</HI> were re&s;olv'd to obey <HI>Argyle;</HI> who they &s;aw could protect them.

There was a great appearance every Morning, at his Lodging, of tho&s;e Officers who were known to have &s;erv'd the King; his Commi&s;&s;ions &s;hew'd in many hands; no que|&s;tion being more commonly asked, than <Q>&startq;when doth my Lord <HI>Hol|land&endq;</HI> go out?</Q> and the An&s;wer was, <Q>&startq;&endq;&s;uch and &s;uch a day;</Q> and the hour he did take Hor&s;e, when he was accompanied by an hundred Hor&s;e from his Hou&s;e, was publickly talked of two or three days before.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t Rendezvous was at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames;</HI> where he &s;tayed two nights, and one whole day, expecting a great re&s;ort to him, not <MILESTONE N="40"> only of Officers, but of Common Men, who had promi&s;ed, and li&s;ted them&s;elves under &s;everal Officers; and he imputed the &s;ecurity he had enjoyed &s;o long, notwith&s;tanding his purpo&s;e was &s;o generally known, to the apprehen&s;ion both the Parliament and the Army had of the Af|fections of the City to joyn with him; and he believ'd, that he &s;hould not only remain &s;ecure at <HI>Kingston,</HI> as long as he &s;hould think fit to &s;tay there, but that &s;ome entire Regiments of the City would march out with him for the Relief of <HI>Colche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>DURING the &s;hort &s;tay he made at <HI>Kingston,</HI> &s;ome Officers and Sol|diers, both of Hor&s;e and Foot, came thither, and many Per&s;ons of Ho|nour <MILESTONE N="50"> and Quality, in their Coaches, came to vi&s;it Him and his Com|pany from <HI>London;</HI> and return'd thither again to provide what was &s;till wanting, and re&s;olv'd to be with him &s;oon enough. The principal Officer
<PB N="136" REF="1560">
the Earl relied upon (though he had better) was <HI>Dalbeer</HI> a <HI>Dutch-</HI>man, of name and reputation, and good experience in War; who had &s;erv'd the Parliament as Commi&s;&s;ary General of the Hor&s;e under the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and having been left out in the new model, was among&s;t tho&s;e di&s;contented Officers who looked for an opportunity to be revenged of the Army; which they de&s;pi&s;ed for their ill breeding, and much preach|ing. Thus <HI>Dalbeer</HI> was glad to depend upon the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who thought him&s;elf likewi&s;e happy in &s;uch an Officer. The keeping good Guards, and &s;ending out Parties towards the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> parts, where it was known &s;ome Troops remain'd &s;ince the la&s;t commotion there, was <MILESTONE N="10"> committed to His care. But he di&s;charged it &s;o ill, or his Orders were &s;o ill ob&s;erv'd, that the &s;econd or third morning after their coming to <HI>Kingston,</HI> &s;ome of the Parliament's Foot, with two or three Troops of Colonel <HI>Rich</HI>'s Hor&s;e, fell upon a Party of the Earl's about <HI>Non&s;uch;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Is routed there:</NOTE> and beat, and pur&s;ued them into <HI>Kingston,</HI> before tho&s;e within had no|tice to be ready to receive them; the Earl and mo&s;t of the re&s;t making too much ha&s;t out of Town, and never offering to Charge tho&s;e Troops. In this confu&s;ion the Lord <HI>Francis Villiers,</HI> a youth of rare Beauty and comline&s;s of Per&s;on, endeavouring to make re&s;i&s;tance, was unfortunately killed, with one or two more but of little note. Mo&s;t of <MILESTONE N="20"> the Foot made a &s;hift to conceal them&s;elves, and &s;ome Officers, until they found means to retire to their clo&s;e Man&s;ions in <HI>London.</HI> The Earl with near an hundred Hor&s;e (the re&s;t wi&s;ely taking the way to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> where they were never inquired after) wander'd without purpo&s;e, or de&s;ign, and was, two or three days after, be&s;et in an Inn at S^t <HI>Neots</HI> in <HI>Huntington&s;hire,</HI> by tho&s;e few Hor&s;e who pur&s;ued him, being joyn'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E&s;capes to S^t</HI> Neots, <HI>where he is taken.</HI></NOTE> with &s;ome Troops of Colonel <HI>Scroop</HI>'s; where the Earl deliver'd him|&s;elf Pri&s;oner to the Officer without re&s;i&s;tance: yet at the &s;ame time <HI>Dalbeer</HI> and <HI>Kenelm Digby,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of S^r <HI>Kenelm,</HI> were killed upon the place; whether out of former grudges, or that they offer'd <MILESTONE N="30"> to defend them&s;elves, was not known; and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> e&s;caped, and happily found a way into <HI>London;</HI> where he lay concealed, till he had an opportunity to &s;ecure him&s;elf by being tran&s;ported into <HI>Holland;</HI> where the Prince was; who receiv'd him with great grace and kindne&s;s. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> remain'd Pri&s;oner in the place where he was taken, till by Order from the Parliament he was &s;ent to <HI>Warwick</HI> Ca&s;tle, where he was kept Pri&s;oner with great &s;trictne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE total defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army lately mention'd &s;ucceeded this, and when tho&s;e Noble Per&s;ons within <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> were adverti&s;ed of both, they knew well that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of relief, nor could <MILESTONE N="40"> they &s;ub&s;i&s;t longer to expect it, being pre&s;&s;ed with want of all kind of Victual, and having eaten near all their Hor&s;es. They &s;ent therefore to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> to treat about the delivery of the Town upon rea&s;onable con|ditions, but he refu&s;ed to treat, or give any conditions, if they would not render to mercy all the Officers, and Gentlemen; the Common Sol|diers he was contented to di&s;mi&s;s. A day or two was &s;pent in delibera|tion. <Q>They within, propo&s;ed &startq;to make a brisk Sally; and thereby to&endq; &s;hift for them&s;elves, as many as could.</Q> But they had too few Hor&s;e, and the few that were left uneaten were too weak for that Enterpri&s;e. <Q>Then, &startq;that they &s;hould open a Port, and every Man die with their&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> Armes in their hands;</Q> but that way they could only be &s;ure of be|ing killed, without much hurting their Adver&s;aries, who had ways enough &s;ecurely to a&s;&s;ault them. Hereupon, they were in the end obliged
<PB N="137" REF="1570">
to deliver them&s;elves up Pri&s;oners at mercy; and were, all the Officers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colche&s;ter <HI>$Word$.</HI></NOTE> and Gentlemen, led into the publick Hall of the Town; where they were locked up, and a &s;trong Guard &s;et upon them. They were required pre&s;ently to &s;end a li&s;t of all their Names to the General; which they did; and, within a &s;hort time after, a Guard was &s;ent to bring S^r <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> and S^r <HI>George Li&s;le,</HI> and S^r <HI>Bernard Ga&s;coigne</HI> to the General, being &s;ate with his Council of War. <Q>They were carried in, and in a very &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e told, &startq;that after &s;o long and &s;o ob&s;tinate a defence un|til they found it nece&s;&s;ary to deliver them&s;elves up to mercy, it was nece&s;&s;ary, for the example of others, and that the Peace of the King|dom <MILESTONE N="10"> might be no more di&s;turbed in that manner, that &s;ome Military ju&s;tice &s;hould be executed; and therefore, that Council had deter|min'd&endq; they three &s;hould be pre&s;ently &s;hot to death;</Q> for which they were advi&s;ed to prepare them&s;elves; and without con&s;idering, or hear|ing what they had a mind to &s;ay for them&s;elves, they were led into a Yard there by; where they found three Files of Mu&s;queteers ready for their di&s;patch.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Bernard Ga&s;coigne</HI> was a Gentleman of <HI>Florence;</HI> and had &s;erv'd the King in the War, and afterwards remain'd in <HI>London</HI> till the un|happy adventure of <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> and then accompanied his Friends thi|ther; <MILESTONE N="20"> and had only <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> enough to make him&s;elf under&s;tood, that he de&s;ired a Pen and Ink and Paper, that he might write a Letter to $Word$ Prince the Great Duke, that his Highne&s;s might know in what manner he lo&s;t his Life, to the end his Heirs might po&s;&s;e&s;s his E&s;tate. $Word$ Of|ficer that attended the execution thought fit to acquaint the $Word$ and Council, without which he dur&s;t not allow him Pen and Ink, which he thought he might rea&s;onably demand: When they were inform'd of it, they thought it a matter worthy &s;ome con&s;ideration&punc; they had cho&s;en him out of the li&s;t for his Quality, conceiving him to be an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gen|tleman; and preferr'd him for being a Knight, that they might &s;acrifice <MILESTONE N="30"> three of that rank.</P>
<P>THIS delay brought the News of this bloody re&s;olution to the Pri|&s;oners in the Town; who were infinitely afflicted with it; and the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> prevailed with an Officer, or Soldier of their Guard, to carry a Letter, &s;ign'd by the chief Per&s;ons and Officers, and in the name of the re&s;t, to the General; in which they took notice of that judgement, and de&s;ired him <Q>&startq;either to forbear the execution of it, or that they might all, who were equally guilty with tho&s;e three, undergo the &s;ame Sen|tence&endq; with Them.</Q> The Letter was deliver'd, but had no other effect than the &s;ending to the Officer to di&s;patch his Order, re&s;erving the <HI>Ita|lian</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> to the la&s;t. S^r <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> was their fir&s;t work; who fell dead; upon which S^r <HI>George Li&s;le</HI> ran to him, embraced, and ki&s;&s;ed him; and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> $Word$ <HI>and S^$</HI> Li&s;le <HI>$Word$ death.</HI></NOTE> then &s;tood up, and looked tho&s;e who were to execute him in the face; and thinking they &s;tood at too great a di&s;tance, &s;pake to them to come nearer; to which one of them &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;I'le warrant you,</Q> S^r, Wee'll hit you: he An&s;wer'd &s;miling, <Q>&startq;Friends, I have been nearer you, when you have&endq; mi&s;s'd me.</Q> Thereupon, they all fired upon him, and did their work home, &s;o that he fell down dead of many wounds without &s;peaking word. S^r <HI>Bernard Ga&s;coigne</HI> had his doublet off, and expected the next turn; but the Officer told him <Q>&startq;&endq;he had order to carry him back to his Friends;</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"> which at that time was very indifferent to him. The Council of War had con&s;ider'd, that if they &s;hould in this manner have taken the Life of a Forreigner, who &s;eem'd to be a Per&s;on of Quality, their Friends or
<PB N="138" REF="1580">
Children who &s;hould vi&s;it <HI>Italy,</HI> might pay dear for many Generations; and therefore they commanded the Officer, <Q>&startq;when the other two &s;hould&endq; be dead, to carry him back again to the other Pri&s;oners.</Q></P>
<P>THE two who were thus murther'd, were Men of great name and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Chara|cters</NOTE> e&s;teem in the War; the one being held as good a Commander of Hor&s;e, and the other of Foot, as the Nation had; but of very different tem|pers and humours. <HI>Lucas</HI> was the younger Brother of the Lord <HI>Lucas,</HI> and his Heir both to the Honour and E&s;tate, and had a pre&s;ent Fortune of his own. He had been bred in the Low Countries under the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and allways among&s;t the Hor&s;e. He had little conver&s;ation <MILESTONE N="10"> in that Court, where great civility was practiced, and learned. He was very brave in his Per&s;on, and in a day of Battle a gallant Man to look upon, and follow; but at all other times and places, of a Nature &s;carce to be liv'd with, of no good under&s;tanding, of a rough and proud hu|mour, and very moro&s;e conver&s;ation; yet they all de&s;ired to accom|pany him in his death. <HI>Li&s;le</HI> was a Gentleman who had had the &s;ame Education with the other, and at the &s;ame time an Officer of Foot; had all the Courage of the other, and led his Men to a Battle with &s;uch an alacrity, that no Man was ever better followed, his Soldiers never for&s;aking him; and the party which he commanded, never left any thing <MILESTONE N="20"> undone which he led them upon. But then, to his fiercene&s;s of Cou|rage he had the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t gentle nature imaginable; was kind to all, and belov'd of all, and without a Capacity to have an Enemy.</P>
<P>THE manner of taking the Lives of the&s;e worthy Men was new, and without Example, and concluded by mo&s;t Men to be very barbarous; and was generally imputed to <HI>Ireton,</HI> who &s;wayed the General, and was upon all occa&s;ions of an unmerciful and bloody Nature. A&s;&s;oon as this bloody Sacrifice was ended, <HI>Fairfax,</HI> with the Chief Officers, went to the Town Hou&s;e to vi&s;it the Pri&s;oners; and the General (who was an ill Orator on the mo&s;t plau&s;ible occa&s;ion) applied with his civility to the <MILESTONE N="30"> Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Capel;</HI> and, &s;eeming in &s;ome degree to excu&s;e the having done that, <Q>which he &s;aid &startq;the Military ju&s;tice re|quired,&endq;</Q> he told them, <Q>&startq;that all the Lives of the re&s;t were &s;afe; and that they &s;hould be well treated, and di&s;po&s;ed of as the Parliament&endq; &s;hould direct.</Q> The Lord <HI>Capel</HI> had not &s;o &s;oon dige&s;ted this &s;o late barbarous proceeding, as to receive the vi&s;it of tho&s;e who cau&s;ed it, with &s;uch a return as his condition might have prompted to him; <Q>but &s;aid, &startq;that they &s;hould do well to fini&s;h their work, and execute the &s;ame&endq; rigour to the re&s;t;</Q> upon which there were two or three &s;uch &s;harp and bitter replies between Him and <HI>Ireton,</HI> that co&s;t him his Life in few <MILESTONE N="40"> Months after. When the General had given notice to the Parliament of his proceedings, he receiv'd order to &s;end the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> and the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle; where they had afterwards the So|ciety of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to lament each others misfortunes; and after &s;ome time they two were &s;ent to the Tower.</P>
<P>THOUGH the City had undergone &s;o many &s;evere Mortifications, that it might very well have been di&s;couraged from entring into any more dangerous Engagements, at lea&s;t all other People might have been terrified from depending again upon &s;uch Engagements, yet the pre&s;ent fright was no &s;ooner over than they recover'd new &s;pirits for new un|dertakings; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The behaviour of the City at this time.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> and &s;eem'd allways to have ob&s;erv'd &s;omewhat in the la&s;t mi&s;carriage which might be hereafter prevented, and no more ob&s;truct their future proceedings; and many in the Parliament, as well as in the
<PB N="139" REF="1590">
City, who were controlled and di&s;pirited by the pre&s;ence of the Army, when that was at a di&s;tance appear'd re&s;olute, and brisk in any contra|diction and oppo&s;ition of their Coun&s;els. So that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had no &s;ooner begun his March towards the North, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> his into <HI>Kent,</HI> but the Common Council deliver'd a Petition to the Parliament, <Q>&startq;that <NOTE PLACE="marg">They Petition for a per&s;onal Treaty.</NOTE> they would entertain a per&s;onal Treaty with the King, that the King|dom might be re&s;tored again to a happy Peace; which could be hoped&endq; for no other way.</Q> This was the fir&s;t pre&s;umption that had been offer'd, &s;ince their Vote of no more Addre&s;&s;es to be made to the King; which had been near half a year before: and this &s;eem'd to be made with &s;o <MILESTONE N="10"> univer&s;al a concurrence of the City, that the Parliament dur&s;t not give a po&s;itive refu&s;al to it. And in truth the Major part thereof did really de&s;ire the &s;ame thing; which made S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and that Party in the Parliament to which the Army adher'd, or rather which adher'd to the Army, to contrive &s;ome &s;pecious way to defer and delay it by &s;eem|ing to con&s;ent to it, rather than to oppo&s;e the motion. And therefore they appointed a Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to meet with <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee of Parliament treats with them about it.</NOTE> &s;uch a Committee of the Common Council, as they &s;hould make choice of, to confer together of the ways and means to provide for the King's &s;afety and &s;ecurity during the time of the Treaty: which Committee <MILESTONE N="20"> being met together, that of the Hou&s;e of Commons perplexed the other with many Que&s;tions, <Q>&startq;what they meant by tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, they&endq; u&s;ed in their Petition</Q> (and had been the Common Expre&s;&s;ions, long u&s;ed both by the King and the Parliament, in all applications which had concern'd a Treaty) <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty might treat with honour, free|dom, and &s;afety? what they intended by tho&s;e words? and whether the City would be at the Charge in maintaining tho&s;e Guards, which were to be kept for the &s;ecurity of the King during &s;uch Treaty; and if the King &s;hould in that Treaty refu&s;e to give the Parliament &s;ati&s;|faction,&endq; how his Per&s;on &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of?</Q> and many &s;uch Que|&s;tions, <MILESTONE N="30"> to which they well knew that the Committee it &s;elf could make no An&s;wer, but that there mu&s;t be another Common Council called, to which they mu&s;t repair for directions. And by this means, and ad|mini&s;tring new Que&s;tions at every meeting; much time was &s;pent, and the delays they wi&s;hed could not be avoided. So that notwith&s;tanding all the City's earne&s;tne&s;s that the Treaty might be pre&s;ently enter'd upon, it was delayed till the In&s;urrection in <HI>Kent,</HI> and the de&s;igns of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> (to both which they had promi&s;ed another kind of A&s;&s;i&s;tance) were both di&s;appointed, and expired. However, the Prince was &s;till in the <HI>Downs</HI> with his Fleet, and the Gentlemen in <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> defended <MILESTONE N="40"> them&s;elves re&s;olutely, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was enter'd the Kingdom, all which kept up their Courage; in&s;omuch as, after all the delays, the Par|liament con&s;ented, and declared, <Q>&startq;that they would enter into a per|&s;onal <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment declares for a per&s;onal Treaty.</NOTE> Treaty with the King for the &s;ettling the Peace of the Kingdom; but that the Treaty &s;hould be in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> where his Maje&s;ty&endq; &s;hould enjoy honour, freedom, and &s;afety.</Q></P>
<P>THE City had offer'd before to the Committee, upon &s;ome of the Que&s;tions which had been admini&s;ter'd to them, <Q>&startq;that if the Treaty might be in <HI>London,</HI> they would be at the Charge of maintaining tho&s;e Guards which &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety and &s;ecurity of the&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> King;</Q> and therefore they were very much troubled, that the Treaty &s;hould be now in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> upon which they could have no in|fluence; yet they thought not fit to make any new In&s;tances for change
<PB N="140" REF="1600">
of the place, le&s;t the Parliament might recede from their Vote, that there &s;hould be a Treaty enter'd upon. So they only renew'd their im|portunity, that all expedition might be u&s;ed; and in &s;pight of all de|lays, in the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> a Committee was &s;ent from both Hou&s;es <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Committee of both Hou&s;es &s;ent to the King for that purpo&s;e in the beginning of</HI> Augu&s;t. <HI>The Sub&s;tance of their Me&s;|&s;age to the King.</HI></NOTE> to the King to <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> Ca&s;tle, where he had been clo&s;e &s;hut up about half a year, without being &s;uffer'd to &s;peak with any but &s;uch who were appointed by them to attend, and watch him.</P>
<P><Q>THE Me&s;&s;age the Committee deliver'd was, &startq;that the Hou&s;es did de&s;ire a Treaty with his Maje&s;ty, in what place of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> he would appoint, upon the Propo&s;itions tender'd to him at <HI>Hampton</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> Court, and &s;uch other Propo&s;itions, as they &s;hould cau&s;e to be pre|&s;ented to him; and that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould enjoy honour, freedom,&endq; and &s;afety to his Per&s;on.</Q> The Me&s;&s;engers, who were one of the Hou&s;e of Peers and two Commoners, were to return within ten days, no body being very &s;trict in the limitation of time to a day, becau&s;e the Treaty was &s;o much the longer kept off, which they hoped &s;till would by &s;ome accident be prevented.</P>
<P><Q>THE King receiv'd them very graciou&s;ly, and told them, &startq;they could not believe that any Man could de&s;ire a Peace more heartily than Him|&s;elf, becau&s;e no Man &s;uffer'd &s;o much by the want of it: that, though <MILESTONE N="20"> he was without any Man to con&s;ult with, and without a Secretary to write what he &s;hould dictate, yet they &s;hould not be put to &s;tay long&endq; for an An&s;wer;</Q> which he gave them within two or three days, all written in his own hand; <Q>in which, after he had lamented his pre&s;ent condition, and the extreme re&s;traint he was under, he &s;aid, &startq;he did very <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's An&s;wer.</NOTE> chearfully embrace their motion, and accepted a Treaty They promi&s;ed &s;hould be with honour, freedom, and &s;afety; which he hoped they did really intend &s;hould be perform'd; for that, in the condition he was in, he was &s;o totally ignorant, and uniform'd of the pre&s;ent State of all his Dominions, that a blind Man was as fit to judge of Colours, as <MILESTONE N="30"> He was to treat concerning the Peace of the Kingdom, except they would fir&s;t revoke their Votes, and Orders, by which all Men were prohibited, and forbid to come, write, or &s;peak to him. For the place, he could have wi&s;hed, for the expedition that would have re&s;ulted from thence, that it might have been in or near <HI>London,</HI> to the end that the Parliament's re&s;olution and determination might have been &s;ooner known upon any emergent occa&s;ion that might have grown in the Treaty, than it could be at &s;uch a di&s;tance: however, &s;ince they had re&s;olv'd that it &s;hould be in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> he would not ex|cept again&s;t it, but named the Town of <HI>Newport</HI> for the place of the&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> Treaty.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;though he de&s;ired all expedition might be u&s;ed to|wards the beginning and ending the Treaty, yet he &s;hould not think him&s;elf in any freedom to treat, except, before the Treaty begun, all &s;uch Per&s;ons might have liberty to repair to him, who&s;e advice and&endq; a&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;hould &s;tand in need of in the Treaty.</Q> He &s;ent a Li&s;t of the names of tho&s;e his Servants which he de&s;ired might be admitted to come to him, and attend upon him; whereof the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> were the chief; all four Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, and of his Privy Council.

<P>BY the time that the Commi&s;&s;ioners return'd from the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> and deliver'd this An&s;wer to the Parliament, news was brought of the defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> had written to his Friends, <Q>&startq;what a perpetual Ignominy it would be to the Parliament, that no body abroad or at home would ever give credit to them, if they &s;hould re|cede from their former Vote, and Declaration of no farther Addre&s;&s;es&endq; to the King, and conjured them to continue firm in that re&s;olution.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"> But they had gone too far now to recede, and &s;ince the fir&s;t motion and petition from the Common Council for a Treaty, very many Members, who had oppo&s;ed the Vote and Declaration of no more Addre&s;&s;es, and from the time that had pa&s;&s;ed, had forborne ever to be pre&s;ent in the Parliament, upon the fir&s;t mention of a Treaty, flocked again to the Hou&s;e, and advanced that Overture; &s;o that they were much &s;uperior in Number to tho&s;e who endeavour'd fir&s;t to ob&s;truct and delay, and now hoped ab&s;olutely to fru&s;trate all that had been propo&s;ed towards a Treaty. And the great Victory which had been obtained again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> and which they concluded mu&s;t &s;peedily reduce <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20"> put a quick period to all other attempts again&s;t the Parliament, made them more earne&s;t and &s;ollicitous for a Treaty; which was all the hope left to prevent that confu&s;ion they di&s;cern'd was the purpo&s;e of the Ar|my to bring upon the Kingdom: and &s;o with the more Vigour they pre&s;&s;ed <Q>&startq;that &s;atisfaction might be given to the King, in all that he had&endq; propo&s;ed in his An&s;wer;</Q> and, notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition, it was declared, <Q>&startq;that the Vote for no more Addre&s;&s;es &s;hould &s;tand repealed: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Vote of no more Ad|dre&s;&s;es repeal|ed; and the Treaty to be at</HI> Newport.</NOTE> that the Treaty &s;hould be at <HI>Newport;</HI> and that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be there in the &s;ame freedom in which he was at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court; that <MILESTONE N="30"> the In&s;tructions to Colonel <HI>Hammond,</HI> by which the King had been in that manner re&s;train'd, and all Per&s;ons forbid from going to him, &s;hould be recalled; that all tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were named by the King, &s;hould have free liberty to repair to him, and to remain with him&endq; without being que&s;tion'd, or troubled.</Q> And having proceeded thus far, they nominated five Lords, and ten Commoners to be the Commi&s;|&s;ioners who &s;hould treat with the King, and who were enjoyn'd to pre|pare all things to be in readine&s;s for the Treaty with all po&s;&s;ible ex|pedition; but S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> being one of tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners, u&s;ed all his Arts to ob&s;truct and delay it, in hope that <HI>Cromwell</HI> would di&s;patch his Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> time enough to return, and to u&s;e more <MILESTONE N="40"> effectual and powerful Arguments again&s;t it, than He was furni&s;hed withal.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e occurrences were very well known to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and were the motives which per&s;waded him to believe, that his pre&s;ence at the Parliament was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s the Presbyterians, who cea&s;ed not to vex him at any di&s;tance, that he would not be prevailed with to &s;tay and fini&s;h that only work of difficulty that remain'd to be done, which was the reducing <HI>Pontfret</HI> Ca&s;tle; but left <HI>Lambert</HI> to make an end of it, and to revenge the death of <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> who had lo&s;t his Life by that Garri&s;on, with &s;ome circum&s;tances which de&s;erve to <MILESTONE N="50"> be remember'd; as in truth all that adventure in the taking, and de|fending that place, &s;hould be pre&s;erv'd by a very particular relation, for the honour of all the Per&s;ons who were engaged in it.</P>

WHEN the fir&s;t War had been brought to an end by the reduction <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the taking</HI> Pontfret <HI>Ca|&s;tle for the King.</HI></NOTE> of all places, and Per&s;ons, which had held for the King, and all Men's hopes had been render'd de&s;perate, by the impri&s;onment of his Maje&s;ty in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> tho&s;e Officers and Gentlemen who had &s;erv'd, whil&s;t there was any Service, betook them&s;elves generally to the habi|tations they had in the &s;everal Counties; where they liv'd quietly and privately, under the in&s;olence of tho&s;e Neighbours who had formerly, by the inferiority of their conditions, &s;ubmitted to them. When the Parliament had fini&s;hed the War, they reduced and &s;lighted mo&s;t of the Inland Garri&s;ons, the maintainance whereof was very chargeable: yet <MILESTONE N="10"> by the Intere&s;t of &s;ome Per&s;on who commanded it, or out of the con|&s;ideration of the &s;trength and importance of the place, they kept &s;till a Garri&s;on in <HI>Pontfret</HI> Ca&s;tle, a noble Royalty and Palace belonging to the Crown, and then part of the Queen's Joynture. The Situation in it &s;elf was very &s;trong; no part whereof was commanded by any other ground: the Hou&s;e very large, with all offices &s;uitable to a Princely Seat, and though built very near the top of a Hill, &s;o that it had the pro&s;pect of a great part of the We&s;t Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and of <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Nottingham-&s;hire,</HI> yet it was plentifully &s;upplied with Water. Colonel <HI>Cotterell,</HI> the Governour of this Ca&s;tle, exerci&s;ed a very &s;evere <MILESTONE N="20"> juri&s;diction over his Neighbours of tho&s;e parts; which were inhabited by many Gentlemen, and Soldiers, who had &s;erv'd the King throughout the War, and who were known to retain their old Affections, though they liv'd quietly under the pre&s;ent Government. Upon the lea&s;t jea|lou&s;y or humour, the&s;e Men were frequently &s;ent for, reproached, and &s;ometimes impri&s;oned by the Governour in this Garri&s;on; which did not render them the more devoted to him. When there appeared &s;ome hopes that the <HI>Scots</HI> would rai&s;e an Army for the relief and relea&s;e of the King, S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> in his way for <HI>Scotland,</HI> had vi|&s;ited and conferr'd with &s;ome of his old Friends and Country-men, who <MILESTONE N="30"> now liv'd quietly within &s;ome di&s;tance of <HI>Pontfret,</HI> who inform'd him of that Garri&s;on, the place whereof was well known to him. And he acquainting them with the A&s;&s;urance he had of the re&s;olution of the principal Per&s;ons of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that they had invited him to joyn with them, in order to which he was then going thither, they agreed, <Q>&startq;that, when it &s;hould appear that an Army was rai&s;ed in <HI>Scotland</HI> upon that account, which mu&s;t draw down the Parliament's Army into the other Northern Counties, and that there &s;hould be&endq; Ri&s;ings in other parts of the Kingdom</Q> (which the general indi&s;po&s;ition and di&s;content, be&s;ides &s;ome particular de&s;igns, made like to fall out <MILESTONE N="40"> <Q>&startq;that then tho&s;e Gentlemen &s;hould endeavour the &s;urpri&s;e of that Ca|&s;tle, and after they had made them&s;elves &s;trong in it, and furni&s;hed it with Provi&s;ions to endure &s;ome re&s;traint, they &s;hould draw as good&endq; a Body to them as tho&s;e Countries would yield: and having thus ad|ju&s;ted that de&s;ign,</Q> they &s;ettled &s;uch a way of corre&s;pondence with S^r <HI>Marmaduke,</HI> that they frequently gave him an account, and receiv'd his directions for their proceeding. In this di&s;po&s;ition they continued quiet, as they had allways been; and the Governour of the Ca&s;tle liv'd towards them with le&s;s jealou&s;y, and more humanity, than he had been accu&s;tom'd to. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THERE was one Colonel <HI>Morrice,</HI> who, being a very young Man, had, in the beginning of the War, been an Officer in &s;ome Regiments of the King's; and out of the folly and impatience of his Youth, had quitted
<PB N="143" REF="1630">
that Service, and engaged him&s;elf in the Parliament Army with &s;ome circum&s;tances not very commendable; and by the clearne&s;s of his Cou|rage, and plea&s;antne&s;s of his humour, made him&s;elf not only very ac|ceptable, but was preferr'd to the command of a Colonel, and perform'd many notable Services for them, being a &s;tout and bold undertaker in attempts of the greate&s;t danger; wherein he had u&s;ually &s;ucce&s;s. After the new modelling of the Army, and the introducing of a &s;tricter di&s;ci|pline, his Life of great Licence kept not his reputation with the new Officers; and being a free Speaker and Cen&s;urer of their affected beha|viour, they left him out in their compounding their new Army, but <MILESTONE N="10"> with many profe&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s, and re&s;pect to his eminent Courage, which they would find &s;ome occa&s;ion to imploy, and reward. He was a Gentleman of a competent E&s;tate in tho&s;e parts in <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> and as he had grown elder, he had heartily dete&s;ted him&s;elf for having quitted the King's Service, and had re&s;olv'd to take &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable opportu|nity to wipe off that blemi&s;h by a &s;ervice that would redeem him; and &s;o was not troubled to be &s;et a&s;ide by the new General, but betook him|&s;elf to his E&s;tate; enjoyed his old humour, which was chearful and plea|&s;ant; and made him&s;elf mo&s;t acceptable to tho&s;e who were mo&s;t tru&s;ted by the Parliament; who thought that they had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed one of the be&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> Officers they had, and were &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>HE now, as a Country Gentleman, frequented the Faires and Markets, and conver&s;ed with equal freedom with all his Neighbours, of what Party &s;oever they had been, and renewed the friend&s;hip he had formerly held with &s;ome of tho&s;e Gentlemen who had &s;erv'd the King. But no friend&s;hip was &s;o dear to him, as that of the Governour of <HI>Pontfret</HI> Ca&s;tle, who lov'd him above all Men, and delighted &s;o much in his Com|pany, that he got him to be with him &s;ome times a week and more at a time in the Ca&s;tle, when they allways lay together in one Bed. He declared to one of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who were united together to make <MILESTONE N="30"> that attempt, <Q>&startq;that he would &s;urpri&s;e that Ca&s;tle, whenever they &s;hould&endq; think the Sea&s;on ripe for it,</Q> and that Gentleman, who knew him very well, believ'd him &s;o entirely, that he told his Companies, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould not trouble them&s;elves with contriving the means to &s;ur|pri&s;e the place; which, by tru&s;ting too many, would be liable to di&s;|covery; but that he would take that charge upon him&s;elf, by a way&endq; they need not enquire into;</Q> which he a&s;&s;ured them &s;hould not fail: and they all very willingly acquie&s;ced in his undertaking; to which they knew well he was not inclined without good grounds. <HI>Morrice</HI> was more frequently with the Governour, who never thought him&s;elf well <MILESTONE N="40"> without him; and allways told him <Q>&startq;he mu&s;t have a great care of his Garri&s;on, that he had none but faithful Men in the Ca&s;tle; for that he was confident there were &s;ome Men, who liv'd not far off, and who&endq; many times came to vi&s;it him, had &s;ome de&s;ign upon the place;</Q> and would then in confidence name many Per&s;ons to him, &s;ome whereof were tho&s;e very Men with whom he communicated, and others were Men of another temper, and were mo&s;t devoted to the Parliament, all his particular Friends and Companions; <Q>&startq;but that he &s;hould not be troubled; for he had a fal&s;e Brother among&s;t them, from whom he&endq; was &s;ure to have &s;ea&s;onable Adverti&s;ement;</Q> <Q>and promi&s;ed him, &startq;that <MILESTONE N="50"> he would, within few hours notice, bring him at any time forty or fifty good Men into the Ca&s;tle to reinforce his Garri&s;on, when there&endq; &s;hould be occa&s;ion;</Q> and he would &s;hew him the li&s;t of &s;uch Men, as
<PB N="144" REF="1640">
would be allways ready, and would &s;ometimes bring &s;ome of tho&s;e Men with him, and tell the Governour before them, <Q>&startq;that tho&s;e were in the li&s;t he had given him of the hone&s;t fellows, who would &s;tick to him&endq; when there &s;hould be need;</Q> and others would accidentally tell the Go|vernour, <Q>&startq;that they had li&s;ted them&s;elves with Colonel <HI>Morrice</HI> to come&endq; to the Ca&s;tle, whenever he &s;hould call or &s;end to them.</Q> And all the&s;e Men thus li&s;ted, were fellows very notorious for the bitterne&s;s and ma|lice which they had allways again&s;t the King, not one of which he ever intended to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>HE made him&s;elf very familiar with all the Soldiers in the Ca&s;tle, and <MILESTONE N="10"> u&s;ed to play and drink with them; and when he lay there, would often ri&s;e in the night, and vi&s;it the Guards; and by that means would &s;ome|times make the Governour di&s;mi&s;s, and di&s;charge a Soldier whom he did not like, under pretence <Q>&startq;&endq;that he found him allways a &s;leep, or &s;ome other fault which was not to be examin'd;</Q> and then he would com|mend &s;ome other to him as very fit to be tru&s;ted and relied upon; and by this means he had very much power in the Garri&s;on. The Gover|nour receiv'd &s;everal Letters from his Friends in the Parliament, and in the Country, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould take care of Colonel <HI>Morrice,</HI> who re|&s;olv'd&endq; to betray him;</Q> and inform'd him, <Q>&startq;that he had been in &s;uch <MILESTONE N="20"> and &s;uch Company of Men, who were generally e&s;teem'd mo&s;t Ma|lignant,&endq; and had great Intrigues with them;</Q> all which was well known to the Governour; for the other was never in any of that Company, though with all the &s;hew of &s;ecrecy, in the night, or in places remote from any Hou&s;e, but he allways told the Governour of it, and of many particular pa&s;&s;ages in tho&s;e meetings; &s;o that when the&s;e Letters came to him, he &s;hewed them &s;till to the other; and then both of them laughed at the Intelligence; after which <HI>Morrice</HI> frequently called for his Hor&s;e, and went home to his Hou&s;e, telling his Friend <Q>&startq;that though he had, he knew, no mi&s;tru&s;t of his friend&s;hip, and knew him too well to think <MILESTONE N="30"> him capable of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s, yet he ought not for his own &s;ake be thought to &s;light the information; which would make his Friends the le&s;s careful of him: that they had rea&s;on to give him warning of tho&s;e meetings, which, if he had not known him&s;elf, had been very worthy of his &s;u&s;picion; therefore he would forbear coming to the Ca&s;tle again, till this jealou&s;y of his Friends &s;hould be over; who would know of&endq; this, and be &s;atisfied with it: and no power of the Governour could prevail with him, at &s;uch times, to &s;tay;</Q> but he would be gone, and &s;tay away till he was, after &s;ome time, &s;ent for again with great impor|tunity, the Governour de&s;iring his Coun&s;el and A&s;&s;i&s;tance as much as <MILESTONE N="40"> his Company.</P>
<P>IT fell out, as it u&s;ually doth in Affairs of that nature, when many Men are engaged, that there is an impatience to execute what is projected before the time be throughly ripe. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Fleet, and in <HI>Kent,</HI> and other places, and the daily Alarms from <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if that Army had been entring the Kingdom, made the Gentlemen who were engaged for this Enterpri&s;e, imagine that they deferr'd it too long, and that though they had receiv'd no Orders from S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> which they were to expect, yet they had been &s;ent, and mi&s;carried. Here|upon They called upon the Gentlemen who had undertaken, and He <MILESTONE N="50"> upon <HI>Morrice,</HI> for the Execution of the de&s;ign. The time agreed upon was &s;uch a night, when the Surpri&s;ers were to be ready upon &s;uch a part of the Wall, and to have Ladders to mount in two places, where two
<PB N="145" REF="1650">
Soldiers were to be appointed for Sentinels who were privy to the at|tempt. <HI>Morrice</HI> was in the Ca&s;tle, and in Bed with the Governour, and, according to his cu&s;tom, ro&s;e about the hour he thought all would be ready. They without, made the Sign agreed upon, and were An&s;wer'd by one of the Sentinels from the Wall; upon which they run to both places where they were to mount their Ladders. By &s;ome Accident, the other Sentinel who was de&s;ign'd, was not upon the other part of the Wall; but when the Ladder was mounted there, the Sentinel called out; and finding that there were Men under the Wall, run towards the Court of Guard to call for help; which gave an Alarm to the Garri&s;on: <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;o that, for that time, the de&s;ign was di&s;appointed. But, &s;hortly after, <HI>Morrice,</HI> and &s;ome of the &s;ame Gentlemen &s;urpri&s;ed the Ca&s;tle, under the di&s;gui&s;e of Country-men coming in with Carts of Provi&s;ion; and pre&s;ently &s;ei&s;ed on and ma&s;ter'd the main Guard, and made way for their Friends, Hor&s;e and Foot, to enter. Then two or three of them went to the Governour's Chamber, whom they found in his Bed, and told him <Q>&startq;&endq;the Ca&s;tle was &s;urpri&s;ed, and him&s;elf a Pri&s;oner.</Q> He betook him|&s;elf to his Armes for his defence, but quickly found that his Friend had betrayed it, and the other Gentlemen appearing, of whom he had been before warn'd, his defence was to no purpo&s;e, yet he receiv'd &s;ome <MILESTONE N="20"> wounds. <HI>Morrice</HI> afterwards comforted him with a&s;&s;urance <Q>&startq;of good u&s;age, and that he would procure his pardon from the King for his&endq; Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P>THEY put the Garri&s;on in good order, and &s;o many came to them from <HI>York&s;hire, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> that they could not in a &s;hort time be re&s;train'd, and had lei&s;ure to fetch in all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions for their &s;upport, and to make and renew &s;uch Fortifications as might be nece&s;&s;ary for their defence. From <HI>Nottingham</HI> there came S^r <HI>John Digby,</HI> S^r <HI>Hugh Cartwright,</HI> and a Son and Nephew of his, who had been good Officers in the Army, with many Soldiers who had been under their <MILESTONE N="30"> Command; many other Gentlemen of the three Counties were pre&s;ent, and de&s;erve to have their Names recorded, &s;ince it was an Action through|out of great Courage and Conduct.</P>
<P>CROMWELL'S marching towards the <HI>Scots</HI> with the neglect of the&s;e Men after their fir&s;t appearance, and only appointing &s;ome County Troops to inclo&s;e them from increa&s;ing their &s;trength, gave them great opportunity to grow; &s;o that driving tho&s;e Troops to a greater di&s;tance, they drew contribution from all the parts about them, and made incur|&s;ions much farther, and render'd them&s;elves &s;o terrible, that, as was &s;aid before, after the <HI>Scots</HI> defeat, tho&s;e of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> &s;ent very earne&s;tly <MILESTONE N="40"> to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> <Q>&startq;that he would make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of his Army to re|duce&endq; <HI>Pontfret.</HI></Q> But he, re&s;olving upon his <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Expedition, thought it enough to &s;end <HI>Rainsborough</HI> to perform that Service, with a Regi|ment of Hor&s;e, and one or two of Foot, belonging to the Army; which, with a conjunction of the Country Forces under the &s;ame Command, he doubted not would be &s;ufficient to perform a greater work. A&s;&s;oon as the Ca&s;tle had been reduced, they who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it were very willing to be under the Command of <HI>Morrice;</HI> who declared he would not accept the Charge, nor be Governour of the place, knowing well what jealou&s;ies he might be liable to, at lea&s;t upon any change of for|tune, <MILESTONE N="50"> but under the direction of S^r <HI>John Digby;</HI> who was Colonel Ge|neral of tho&s;e parts, and was a Man rather cordial in the Service, than equal to the Command; which made him refer all things &s;till to the
<PB N="146" REF="1660">
coun&s;el, and conduct of tho&s;e Officers who were under him; by who&s;e activity, as much was done as could be expected from &s;uch a knot of re&s;olute Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE total defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army being now generally known, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Part of the Garri&s;on's at|tempt upon</HI> Rainsborough.</NOTE> that their Friends in all other places were defeated, they in the Ca&s;tle well knew what they were pre&s;ently to expect, and that they &s;hould be &s;hortly &s;hut up from making farther excur&s;ions. They heard that <HI>Rain&s;|borough</HI> was upon his march towards them, and had already &s;ent &s;ome Troops to be Quarter'd near them, him&s;elf yet keeping his Head Quar|ters at <HI>Donca&s;ter,</HI> ten miles from the Ca&s;tle. They re&s;olv'd, whil&s;t they <MILESTONE N="10"> yet enjoyed this liberty, to make a noble attempt. They had been in|form'd, that S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> (whom they &s;till called their Ge|neral) after the overthrow of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, had been taken Pri&s;oner, and remained in <HI>Nottingham</HI> Ca&s;tle under a mo&s;t &s;trict cu&s;tody, as a Man the Parliament declared, <Q>&startq;they would make an example of their&endq; ju&s;tice.</Q> A Party of about twenty Hor&s;e, but picked and choice Men, went out of the Ca&s;tle, in the beginning of the Night, with a Re&s;olu|tion to take <HI>Rainsborough</HI> Pri&s;oner, and thereby to ran&s;om their Ge|neral. They were all good Guides, and under&s;tood the ways, private and publick, very exactly; and went &s;o far, that about the break of day or <MILESTONE N="20"> a little after, in the end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they put them&s;elves into the Com|mon Road that led from <HI>York;</HI> by which ways the Guards expected no Enemy; and &s;o &s;lightly asked them <Q>&startq;&endq;whence they came? who negli|gently An&s;wer'd;</Q> and asked again, <Q>&startq;where their General was? &s;aying,&endq; they had a Letter for him from <HI>Cromwell.</HI></Q> They &s;ent one to &s;hew them where the General was; which they knew well enough; and that he lay at the be&s;t Inn of the Town. And when the Gate of the Inn was opened to them, three of them only enter'd into the Inn, the other rode to the other end of the Town to the Bridge, over which they were to pa&s;s towards <HI>Pontfret;</HI> where they expected, and did find a Guard of <MILESTONE N="30"> Hor&s;e and Foot, with whom they entertain'd them&s;elves in di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aying <Q>&startq;that they &s;tayed for their Officer, who went only in to &s;peak&endq; with the General; and called for &s;ome drink.</Q> The Guards making no que&s;tion of their being Friends, &s;ent for drink, and talked negligently with them of News; and, it being broad day, &s;ome of the Hor&s;e alighted, and the Foot went to the Court of Guard, conceiving that Morning's work to be over. They who went into the Inn, where no body was a wake but the fellow who opened the Gate, asked in which Chamber the General (for &s;o all the Soldiers called <HI>Rainsborough)</HI> lay; and the fellow &s;hewing them from below the Chamber door, two of them went up, <MILESTONE N="40"> and the other &s;tayed below, and held the Hor&s;es, and talked with the Soldier who had walked with them from the Guard. The two who went up, open'd the Chamber door, found <HI>Rainsborough</HI> in his Bed, but awaked with the little noi&s;e they had made. <Q>They told him in &s;hort &startq;that he was their Pri&s;oner, and that it was in his power to choo&s;e&endq; whether he would be pre&s;ently killed</Q> (for which work he &s;aw they were very well prepared) <Q>&startq;or quietly, without making re&s;i&s;tance, or delay, to put on his Cloaths and be mounted upon a Hor&s;e, that was&endq; ready below for him, and accompany them to <HI>Pontfret.</HI></Q> The pre&s;ent danger awaken'd him out of the amazement he was in, &s;o that he told <MILESTONE N="50"> them he would wait upon them, and made the ha&s;t that was nece&s;&s;ary to put on his Cloaths. One of them took his Sword, and &s;o they led him down &s;tairs. He that held the Hor&s;es, had &s;ent the Soldiers away

Whereupon, when they &s;aw no hope of car|rying him away, they immediately run him through with their Swords; and, leaving him dead upon the ground, they got upon their Hor&s;es, and rode towards their fellows, before any in the Inn could be ready to follow them. When tho&s;e at the Bridge &s;aw their Companions coming, <MILESTONE N="10"> which was their &s;ign, being well prepared, and knowing what they were to do, they turn'd upon the Guard, and made them fly in di&s;traction; &s;o that the way was clear and free; and though they mi&s;&s;ed carrying home the prize for which they had made &s;o lu&s;ty an adventure, they joyn'd together, and marched, with the Expedition that was nece&s;&s;ary, a &s;horter way than they had come, to their Garri&s;on; leaving the Town, and Soldiers behind in &s;uch a con&s;ternation, that, not being able to re|ceive any information from their General, whom they found dead upon the ground without any Body in view, they thought the Devil had been there; and could not recollect them&s;elves, which way they were to pur|&s;ue <MILESTONE N="20"> an Enemy they had not &s;een. The Gallant Party came &s;afe home without the lea&s;t damage to Hor&s;e or Man, hoping to make &s;ome other attempt more &s;ucce&s;sfully, by which they might redeem S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale.</HI> There was not an Officer in the Army whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> would not as willingly have lo&s;t as this Man; who was bold and barbarous to his wi&s;h, and fit to be entru&s;ted in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Intere&s;t, and was the Man whom that Party allways intended to commit the Maritime Affairs to, when it &s;hould be time to di&s;mi&s;s the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> he having been bred in that Element, and knowing the duty of it very well, though he had that misfortune &s;poken of in the beginning of the <MILESTONE N="30"> Summer.</P>
<P>AND now to fini&s;h this bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Pont&s;ret</HI> altogether, which la&s;ted near to the end of this year, when <HI>Lambert</HI> came to this charge (in|&s;tructed by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to take full Vengeance for the lo&s;s of <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> to who&s;e Gho&s;t he de&s;ign'd an ample &s;acrifice) and kept what Body of Men he thought fit for that purpo&s;e, he reduced them in a &s;hort time within their own circuit, making good Works round about the Ca&s;tle, that they might at la&s;t yield to Hunger, if nothing el&s;e would reclaim them. Nor did they quietly &s;uffer them&s;elves to be cooped up without bold and frequent Sallies, in which many of the Be&s;iegers, as well as <MILESTONE N="40"> the others, lo&s;t their Lives. They di&s;cover'd many of the Country who held corre&s;pondence with, and gave Intelligence to the Ca&s;tle, whom they apprehended, whereof there were two Divines, and &s;ome Women of Note, Friends and Allies to the be&s;ieged. After frequent Mortifica|tions of this kind, and no human hope of relief, they were content to offer to Treat for the Delivery of the Ca&s;tle, if they might have ho|nourable Conditions; <Q>if not, they &s;ent word &startq;that they had Provi&s;ions yet for a good time; that they dur&s;t die, and would &s;ell their Lives at as dear a price as they could. <HI>Lambert</HI> An&s;wer'd, that he knew they were gallant Men, and that he de&s;ired to pre&s;erve as many of them, <MILESTONE N="50"> as was in his power to do, but he mu&s;t require &s;ix of them to be given up to him, who&s;e Lives he could not &s;ave; which he was &s;orry for,&endq; &s;ince they were brave Men; but his hands were bound.</Q> The &s;ix excepted

Upon the fir&s;t day the Gar|ri&s;on appear'd twice or thrice, as if they were re&s;olv'd to make a Sally, but retired every time without Charging; but the &s;econd day they made a very &s;trong and brisk Sally upon another place than where they had appear'd the day before, and beat the Enemy from their Po&s;t, with the lo&s;s of Men on both &s;ides; and though the Party of the Ca&s;tle was beaten <MILESTONE N="20"> back, two of the &s;ix (whereof <HI>Morrice</HI> was one) made their e&s;cape, the other four being forced to retire with the re&s;t. And all was quiet for two whole days; but, in the beginning of the night of the fourth day, they made another attempt &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly, that two of the other four likewi&s;e e&s;caped: and the next day they made great &s;hews of joy, and &s;ent <HI>Lambert</HI> word, <Q>&startq;&endq;that their &s;ix Friends were gone</Q> (though there were two &s;till remaining) <Q>&startq;and therefore they would be ready the next&endq; day to Surrender.</Q></P>
<P>THE other two thought it to no purpo&s;e to make another attempt, but devi&s;ed another way to &s;ecure them&s;elves, with a le&s;s dangerous <MILESTONE N="30"> A&s;&s;i&s;tance from their Friends, who had lo&s;t &s;ome of their own Lives in the two former Sallies to &s;ave theirs. The buildings of the Ca&s;tle were very large and &s;pacious, and there were great &s;tore of wa&s;t Stones from &s;ome Walls, which were fallen down. They found a convenient place, which was like to be lea&s;t vi&s;ited, where they walled up their two Friends in &s;uch a manner that they had Air to &s;u&s;tain them, and Victual enough to feed them a Month, in which time they hoped they might be able to e&s;cape. And this being done, at the hour appointed they open'd their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pont&s;ret <HI>deli|ver'd up to</HI> Lambert.</NOTE> Ports, and after <HI>Lambert</HI> had cau&s;ed a &s;trict inqui&s;ition to be made for tho&s;e &s;ix, none of which he did believe had in truth e&s;caped, and was <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;atisfied that none of them were among&s;t tho&s;e who were come out, he receiv'd the re&s;t very civilly, and ob&s;erv'd his promi&s;e made to them very punctually, and did not &s;eem &s;orry that the &s;ix gallant Men (as he called them) were e&s;caped.</P>
<P>AND now they heard, which very much reliev'd their broken Spi|rits, that S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> had made an e&s;cape out of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> who &s;hortly after tran&s;ported him&s;elf beyond the Seas. <HI>Lambert</HI> pre&s;ently took care &s;o to di&s;mantle the Ca&s;tle, that there &s;hould be no more u&s;e of it for a Garri&s;on, leaving the va&s;t ruins &s;till &s;tanding; and then drew off all his Troops to new Quarters; &s;o that, <MILESTONE N="50"> within ten days after the Surrender, the two who were left walled up, threw down their inclo&s;ure, and &s;ecurely provided for them&s;elves. S^r <HI>John Digby</HI> liv'd many years after the King's Return, and was often with

his Maje&s;ty. Poor <HI>Morrice</HI> was afterwards taken in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and happen'd to be put to death in the &s;ame place where he had committed a fault again&s;t the King, and where he fir&s;t perform'd a great Service to the Parliament.</P>
<P>IN this de&s;perate condition, that is before de&s;cribed, &s;tood the King's <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condition of the Prince and the Duke of</HI> York <HI>at the</HI> Hague, <HI>and the fa|ctions among their Fol|lowers.</HI></NOTE> Affairs when the Prince was at the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Fleet already mutinying for Pay, his own Family factious and in nece&s;&s;ity, and that of his Bro|ther the Duke of <HI>York</HI> full of Intrigues, and De&s;igns, between the re&s;t|le&s;s unquiet &s;pirit of <HI>Bamfield,</HI> and the ambitious and as unquiet hu|mour of S^r <HI>John Berkley.</HI> The Council, which was not numerous (for <MILESTONE N="10"> the Prince had not Authority to add any to tho&s;e who were his Father's Coun&s;ellors) wanted not unity in it &s;elf, &s;o much as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect from others, which had been lo&s;t to tho&s;e who were in the Fleet, and the prejudice to tho&s;e &s;till remain'd, and &s;o abated much of the re|verence which mo&s;t Men were willing to pay to the two who came la&s;t. And the great animo&s;ity which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had again&s;t the Lord <HI>Cole|pepper</HI> infinitely di&s;turbed the Coun&s;els, and perplexed the Lord <HI>Cot|tington,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had credit enough with the other two. But <HI>Colepepper</HI> had &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities, which no Friends could re&s;train; and though Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was very <MILESTONE N="20"> well inclined to the Chancellor, and would in many things be advi&s;ed by him, yet his prejudice to <HI>Colepepper</HI> was &s;o rooted in him, and that prejudice &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly cultivated by <HI>Herbert</HI> the Atturney General, who had the ab&s;olute A&s;cendent over that Prince, and who did perfectly hate all the world that would not be govern'd by him, that every meet|ing in Council was full of bitterne&s;s and &s;harpne&s;s between them.</P>
<P>ONE day the Council met (as it u&s;ed to do when they did not attend the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> at his lodgings) at the Lord Trea&s;urer's lodging (He and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being in one Hou&s;e) about giving direction for the &s;ale of &s;ome Goods which had been taken at Sea, <MILESTONE N="30"> for the rai&s;ing of Money toward the payment of the Fleet. In &s;uch &s;er|vices Merchants, and other proper Per&s;ons, were allways nece&s;&s;ary to be tru&s;ted. <Q>Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> propo&s;ed &startq;&endq;that one S^r <HI>Robert Wal&s;h</HI></Q> (a Per&s;on too well known to be tru&s;ted) <Q>&startq;&endq;might be employed in that Affair: it was to &s;ell a Ship of Sugar.</Q> No Man who was pre&s;ent would ever have con&s;ented that he &s;hould have been employed; but the Lord <HI>Cole|pepper</HI> &s;poke again&s;t him with &s;ome warmth, &s;o that it might be thought to reflect a little upon Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who had propo&s;ed him. Upon which, He asking <Q>&startq;what exceptions there were to S^r <HI>Robert Wal&s;h,</HI> why he might not be fit for it, <HI>Colepepper</HI> An&s;wer'd with &s;ome quickne&s;s,&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> that he was a known cheat;</Q> which, though notoriou&s;ly true, the Prince &s;eem'd to take very ill; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he was His Friend, and a Gentleman; and if he &s;hould come to hear of what had been &s;aid, he knew not how&endq; the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> could avoid Fighting with him.</Q> <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who&s;e Courage no Man doubted, pre&s;ently replied, <Q>&startq;that he would not&endq; Fight with <HI>Wal&s;h,</HI> but he would Fight with his Highne&s;s;</Q> to which the Prince An&s;wer'd very quietly, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was well;</Q> and the Council ro&s;e in great perplexity.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> went out of the Hou&s;e, and the Chancellor led the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> into the Garden, hoping that he &s;hould &s;o far have <MILESTONE N="50"> prevailed with him, as to have made him &s;en&s;ible of the exce&s;s he had committed, and to have per&s;waded him pre&s;ently to repair to the Prince, and to ask his Pardon, that no more notice might have been taken of it.
<PB N="150" REF="1700">
But he was yet too warm to conceive he had committed any fault, but &s;eem'd to think only of making good what he had &s;o imprudently &s;aid. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> quickly inform'd his Confident the Atturney General of all that had pa&s;&s;ed; who was the unfitte&s;t Man living to be tru&s;ted with &s;uch a &s;ecret, having allways about him &s;tore of Oyl to throw upon &s;uch Fire. He &s;oon found means to make it known to the Prince, who pre|&s;ently &s;ent for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be inform'd of the whole matter; and when he under&s;tood it, was exceedingly troubled, and required him <Q>&startq;to let <HI>Colepepper</HI> know, that he ought to make a&endq; &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI></Q> without which wor&s;e would fall out. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>HE went fir&s;t to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> that he might pacify him till he could convince the other of his fault; and he &s;o far prevailed with his Highne&s;s, who would have been more cholerick if he had had le&s;s Right of his &s;ide, that he was willing to receive a Submi&s;&s;ion; and promi&s;ed <Q>&startq;&endq;that the other &s;hould receive no affront in the mean time.</Q> But he found more difficulty on the other &s;ide, the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> continu|ing &s;till in rage, thought the provocation was &s;o great, that he ought to be excu&s;ed for the Reply, and that the Prince ought to acknowledge the one as well as He the other. But after &s;ome days recollection, find|ing no body with whom he conver&s;ed of his mind, and under&s;tanding <MILESTONE N="20"> how much the Prince was di&s;plea&s;ed, and that he expected he &s;hould ask Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> pardon, and withal reflecting upon the place he was in, where he could expect no &s;ecurity from his Quality and Function, he re&s;olv'd to do what he ought to have done at fir&s;t; and &s;o he went with the Chancellor to Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s lodging; where he behaved him|&s;elf very well; and the Prince receiv'd him with all the Grace could be expected; &s;o that &s;o ill a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd to be as well concluded as the nature of it would admit. But the wor&s;t was to come: the Atturney General had done all he could to di&s;&s;wade that Prince from accepting &s;o &s;mall, and &s;o private a &s;atisfaction; but, not prevailing, he inflamed <MILESTONE N="30"> S^r <HI>Robert Wal&s;h,</HI> who had been inform'd of all that had pa&s;&s;ed at the Council concerning him&s;elf, to take his own revenge; in which many Men thought, that he was a&s;&s;ured Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> would not be offended. And the next Morning after his Highne&s;s had receiv'd &s;atisfaction, as the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> was walking to the Council without a Sword, <HI>Wal&s;h,</HI> coming to him, &s;eem'd quietly to expo&s;tulate with him, for having mention'd him &s;o unkindly. <Q>To the which the other An&s;wer'd, &startq;that he would give him &s;atisfaction in any way he would require; though he ought not to be called in que&s;tion for any thing he had &s;aid in that&endq; place.</Q> On a &s;uddain, whil&s;t they were in this calm di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;truck him with all his force one blow in the face with his fi&s;t; and then &s;tepped back, and drew his Sword; but &s;eeing the other had none, walked away; and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> with his no&s;e and face all bloody, went back to his Chamber, from whence he could not go abroad in many days by the effect and disfiguring of the blow. This outrage was com|mitted about ten of the Clock in the Morning in the &s;ight of the Town; which troubled the Prince exceedingly; who immediately &s;ent to the States to demand Ju&s;tice; and they, according to their method and &s;low proceedings in matters which they do not take to heart, cau&s;ed <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> to be &s;ummon'd, and after &s;o many days, for want of appearance, he <MILESTONE N="50"> was by the &s;ound of a Bell publickly bani&s;hed from the <HI>Hague;</HI> and &s;o he made his re&s;idence in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> or what other place he plea&s;ed. And this was the reparation the States gave the Prince for &s;o Ruffianly
<PB N="151" REF="1710">
a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and both the beginning and the end of this unhappy bu|&s;ine&s;s expo&s;ed the Prince him&s;elf, as well as his Council, to more di&s;ad|vantage, and le&s;s reverence, than ought to have been paid to either.</P>
<P>THE improvidence that had been u&s;ed in the Fleet, be&s;ides its un|activity, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The ill condi|tion of the Prince's Flees in</HI> Holland</NOTE> by the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing &s;o many great Prizes, was now too apparent, when there was neither Money to pay the Seamen, who were not mode&s;t in requiring it, nor to new Victual the Ships, which was as important; &s;ince it was ea&s;y to be fore&s;een, that they could not remain long in the Station where they were for the pre&s;ent, and the extreme licence which all Men took to cen&s;ure and reproach that improvidence, di&s;turbed all <MILESTONE N="10"> Coun&s;els, and made Conver&s;ation it &s;elf very unea&s;y. Nor was it po&s;&s;i|ble to &s;uppre&s;s that Licence; every Man believing that his particular nece&s;&s;ities, with which all Men abounded, might ea&s;ily have been re|liev'd, and provided for, if it had not been for that ill husbandry; which they therefore called treachery and corruption. It cannot be denied but there was &s;o great a trea&s;ure taken, which turn'd to no account, and &s;o much more might have been taken, if the &s;everal Ships had been applied to that end, that a full provi&s;ion might have been made, both for the &s;upport of the Fleet, and &s;upply of the Prince, and of all who depended upon him for a good time, if the &s;ame had been well managed, and <MILESTONE N="20"> could have been depo&s;ited in &s;ome &s;ecure place, till all might have been &s;old at good Markets. And no body was &s;atisfied with the Rea&s;ons which were given for the di&s;charging, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing &s;o many Ships to gratify the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the Presbyterian Party throughout the Kingdom. For, be&s;ides that the value of what was &s;o given away and lo&s;t, was generally believ'd to be worth more than all they would have done, if they had been able, tho&s;e Bounties were not the natural mo|tives which were to be applied to that People; who&s;e Affections had been long dead, and could be revived by nothing but their &s;harp &s;uf|ferings, and their in&s;upportable lo&s;&s;es; the ob&s;truction and de&s;truction <MILESTONE N="30"> of their Trade, and the &s;ei&s;ing upon their E&s;tates, being, at that time, thought by many the mo&s;t proper application to the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the be&s;t Arguments to make them in love with Peace, and to extort it from them in who&s;e power it was to give it. And if the Fleet had applied it &s;elf to that, and vi&s;ited all tho&s;e Maritime parts which were in Counties well affected, and where &s;ome places had declared for the King (as <HI>Scarborough</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> did) if it had not been po&s;&s;ible to have &s;et the King at liberty in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> or to have reliev'd <HI>Colche&s;ler,</HI> (both which many Men believ'd, how unskilfully &s;oever, to be practi|cable) it would have &s;pent the time much more advantageou&s;ly and <MILESTONE N="40"> honourably than it did.</P>
<P>BUT let the ill con&s;equence be never &s;o great, if it had proceeded from any corruption, it would probably have been di&s;cover'd by the examination and inqui&s;ition that was made; and therefore it may be well concluded that there was none. And the truth is, the Queen was &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the purpo&s;e, and the power of the <HI>Scots</HI> to do the King's bu&s;ine&s;s, before the In&s;urrections in the &s;everal parts in <HI>England,</HI> and the revolt of the Fleet appear'd, that &s;he did not enough weigh the good u&s;e that might have been made of tho&s;e when they did happen, but kept her mind then &s;o fixed upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> as the &s;ole foundation <MILESTONE N="50"> of the King's hopes, that &s;he looked upon the benefit of the Fleet's re|turning to their Allegiance, only as an opportunity offer'd by Providence to tran&s;port the Prince with &s;ecurity thither. And her In&s;tructions to
<PB N="152" REF="1720">
tho&s;e &s;he tru&s;ted about the Prince, were &s;o po&s;itive, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould not give con&s;ent to any thing that might divert or delay that Expedi|tion,&endq; that, if the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> had been arriv'd when the Prince came to the Fleet, it would have been immediately engaged to have tran&s;ported the Prince into <HI>Scotland,</HI> what other conveniencies &s;oever, preferable to that, had offer'd them&s;elves.</Q> And the very next day after that Lord's coming to the Prince in the <HI>Downs,</HI> his injunctions and behaviour were &s;o imperious for the Prince's pre&s;ent departure, that nothing but a direct Mutiny among the Seamen prevented it. His High|ne&s;s's own Ship was under Sail for <HI>Holland,</HI> that he might from thence <MILESTONE N="10"> have pro&s;ecuted his other Voyage: nor would he at that time have taken <HI>Holland</HI> in his way, if there had been any quantity of Provi&s;ion in the Fleet for &s;uch a Peregrination. This Expedition for <HI>Scotland</HI> was the more grievous to all Men, becau&s;e it was evident that the Prince him&s;elf was much more inclined to have pur&s;ued other occa&s;ions which were offer'd, and only re&s;ign'd him&s;elf implicitly to the plea&s;ure of his Mother.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent ill condition of the Fleet, and the un&s;teady humour of the Common Seamen was the more notorious, and un&s;ea&s;onable, by the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s coming with another Fleet from the Parliament <MILESTONE N="20"> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> within few days after the Prince came to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Warwick <HI>with his Fleet comes upon the Coa&s;t of</HI> Hol|land.</NOTE> the <HI>Hague,</HI> and Anchoring within view of the King's Fleet. And it is probable he would have made &s;ome ho&s;tile attempt upon it, well know|ing that many Officers and Seamen were on Shore, if the States had not, in the very In&s;tant, &s;ent &s;ome of their Ships of War to pre&s;erve the Peace in Their Port. However, according to the in&s;olence of his Ma|&s;ters, and of mo&s;t of tho&s;e imployed by them, the Earl &s;ent a Summons of a &s;trange Nature to the King's Ships, in which he took notice, <Q>&startq;that a Fleet of Ships, which were part of the Navy Royal of the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> was then riding at Anchor off <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> and bearing <MILESTONE N="30"> a Standard: That he did therefore, by the Parliament's Authority, by which he was con&s;tituted Lord High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> require the Admiral, or Commander in chief of that Fleet, to take down the Standard; and the Captains, and Mariners belonging to the Ships, to render them&s;elves and the Ships to Him, as High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> and for the u&s;e of the King and Parliament: And he did, by the like&endq; Authority, offer an indemnity to all tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;ubmit to him.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER which Summons, though receiv'd by the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who remain'd on Board the Fleet in the Command of Vice-Admiral, with that indignation that was due to it, and though it made no im|pre&s;&s;ion <MILESTONE N="40"> upon the Officers, nor vi&s;ibly, at that time, upon the Common Men, yet, during the time the Earl continued in &s;o near a Neighbour|hood, he did find means by private In&s;inuations, and by &s;ending many of his Seamen on Shore at <HI>Helvoet Sluce</HI> (where they enter'd into con|ver&s;ation with their old Companions) &s;o to work upon and corrupt many of the Seamen, that it afterwards appear'd many were debauched; &s;ome whereof went on Board his Ships, others &s;tayed to do more mi&s;|chief. But that ill Neighbourhood continued not long; for the Sea&s;on of the Year, and the Winds which u&s;ually rage on that Coa&s;t in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> removed him from that Station, and carried him <MILESTONE N="50"> back to the <HI>Downs</HI> to attend new Orders.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e di&s;turbances were attended with a wor&s;e, which fell out at the &s;ame time, and that was the &s;ickne&s;s of the Prince; who, after

&s;ome days indi&s;po&s;ition, appear'd to have the &s;mall Pox; which allmo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> $Word$ <HI>for the &s;mall $Span$.</HI></NOTE> di&s;tracted all who were about him, who knew how much depended upon his precious Life: And therefore the con&s;ternation was very uni|ver&s;al whil&s;t that was thought in danger. But, by the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, he recover'd in few days the peril of that di&s;temper; and, within a Month, was re&s;tored to &s;o perfect Health, that he was able to take an account him&s;elf of his melancholick and perplex'd Affairs.</P>
<P>THERE were two points which were chiefly to be con&s;ider'd, and provided for by the Prince; neither of which would bear delay for the <MILESTONE N="10"> con&s;ultation, and re&s;olution; the fir&s;t, how to make provi&s;ion to pay, and victual the Fleet, and to compo&s;e the mutinous Spirits of the Sea|men; who paid no reverence to their Officers, in&s;omuch as, in the &s;hort &s;tay which the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had made before <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> as hath been &s;aid, many of the Seamen had gone over to him, and the <HI>Con&s;tant Warwick,</HI> a Frigat of the be&s;t Account, had either voluntarily left the Prince's Fleet, or &s;uffer'd it &s;elf willingly to be taken, and car|ried away with the re&s;t into <HI>England.</HI> The other was, what he &s;hould do with the Fleet, when it was both payed and victualled.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the fir&s;t, there were &s;ome Ships brought in with the Fleet, <MILESTONE N="20"> laden with &s;everal Merchandize of value, that, if they could be &s;old to the true worth, would amount to a Sum &s;ufficient to pay the Seamen their Wages, and to put in Provi&s;ions enough to &s;erve four Months; and there were many Merchants from <HI>London,</HI> who were de&s;irous to buy their own Goods, which had been taken from them; and others had Commi&s;&s;ions from thence to buy the re&s;t. But then they all knew, that they could not be carried to any other Market, but mu&s;t be &s;old in the place where they were; and therefore they were re&s;olv'd to have very good Pennyworths. And there were many Debts claim'd, which the Prince had promi&s;ed, whil&s;t he was in the River, &s;hould be paid out of <MILESTONE N="30"> the fir&s;t Money that &s;hould be rai&s;ed upon the &s;ale of &s;uch and &s;uch Ships: particularly, the Prince believ'd that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> who had committed faults enough to the King and Queen, had pawn'd her Necklace of Pearls for fifteen hundred pounds, which &s;he had to|tally disbur&s;ed in &s;upplying Officers, and making other Provi&s;ions for the expedition of the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> which Sum of fifteen hundred pounds the Prince had promi&s;ed the Lord <HI>Peircy</HI> her Brother, who was a very importunate Sollicitor, &s;hould be paid upon the Sale of a Ship that was laden with Sugar, and was then conceiv'd to be worth above &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and pounds. Others had the like Engagements upon other <MILESTONE N="40"> Ships: &s;o that when Money was to be rai&s;ed upon the &s;ale of Merchan|dize, they who had &s;uch Engagements, would be them&s;elves entru&s;ted, or nominate tho&s;e who &s;hould be, to make the bargain with Purcha&s;ers, to the end that they might be &s;ure to receive what they claim'd, out of the fir&s;t Monies that &s;hould be rai&s;ed. By this means, double the value was deliver'd, to &s;atisfy a debt that was not above the half.</P>
<P>BUT that which was wor&s;e than all this, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> adver|ti&s;ed the Prince, that &s;ome Que&s;tions had been &s;tarted in the States, <Q>&startq;&endq;what they &s;hould do, if the Parliament of <HI>England</HI></Q> (which had now a very dreadful name) <Q>&startq;&s;hould &s;end over to them to demand the re&s;ti|tution <MILESTONE N="50"> of tho&s;e Merchants Goods, which had been unju&s;tly taken in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and had been brought into their Ports, and were offer'd to &s;ale there, again&s;t the obligation of
<PB N="154" REF="1740">
that Amity which had been ob&s;erv'd between the two Nations, during the late War? what An&s;wer they &s;hould be able to make, or how they could refu&s;e to permit the owners of tho&s;e Goods to make their Ar+re&s;ts, and to &s;ue in their Admiralty for the &s;ame? which fir&s;t proce&s;$ would &s;top the pre&s;ent Sale of whatever others pretended a Title to&endq; till the right &s;hould be determin'd.</Q> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that&endq; &s;uch Que&s;tions u&s;ed not to be &s;tarted there without de&s;ign;</Q> and there+fore advi&s;ed the Prince <Q>&startq;to lo&s;e no time in making compleat Sales of al$ that was to be &s;old; to the end that they who were engaged in the&endq; Purcha&s;e, might likewi&s;e be engaged in the defence of it.</Q> Upon this Ground, as well as the others which have been mention'd, ha&s;ty Bar|gains were made with all who de&s;ired to buy, and who would not buy except they were &s;ure to be good Gainers by all the Bargains which they made. Nor could this be prevented by the caution or wi&s;dom of any who were upon the place, with no more Authority than they had. M^r <HI>Long,</HI> who was Secretary to the Prince, had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Office of receiving and paying all Monies, whil&s;t the Prince was in the Fleet, and &s;o could not well be removed from it when he came into <HI>Holland:</HI> though he was thought to love Money too well, yet no body who lov'd it le&s;s, would at that time have &s;ubmitted to the imployment, which expo&s;ed him to the importunity and in&s;olence of all nece&s;&s;itous Per&s;ons, when he could &s;atisfy none; yet he liked it well with all its prejudice, and di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the Money was rai&s;ed, it was &s;ent to the Fleet to pay the Seamen; and the Prince made a Journey to the Fleet to &s;ee, and keep up the Spirits of the Seamen, who were very mutinous, not with|out the infu&s;ions of &s;ome who did not de&s;ire they &s;hould be too well plea&s;ed with their Officers. The Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> &s;tayed on board purely out of Duty to the King, though he liked neither the place he had, nor the People over whom he was to Command, who had yet more re&s;pect <MILESTONE N="30"> for Him than for any Body el&s;e. S^r <HI>William Batten</HI> likewi&s;e remain'd with them, not knowing well how to refu&s;e it, though he had too much rea&s;on to be weary of his Province, the Seamen having contracted an implacable jealou&s;y and malice again&s;t him, more than they were na|turally inclined to. And the truth is, though there was not any evi|dence that he had any $oul practices, he had an impatient de&s;ire to make his Peace, and to live in his own Country, as afterwards he did with the leave of the King; again&s;t whom he never after took imployment.</P>
<P>THE other point to be re&s;olv'd was yet more difficult, <Q>&startq;what &s;hould&endq; be done with the Fleet, and who &s;hould Command it?</Q> and though <MILESTONE N="40"> the adverti&s;ement the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had given his Royal Highne&s;s, of the Que&s;tion &s;tarted in the States, concern'd only the Merchants Ships, which were made prize, yet it was very ea&s;y to di&s;cern the Lo|gick of that Que&s;tion would extend as well, and be applied to tho&s;e of the Royal Navy, as to Merchants Ships. And it was evident enough, that the united Provinces would not take upon them to determine whe|ther they were in truth the Ships of the King, or of the Parliament. And it was only the differences which were yet kept up in the Hou&s;es, which kept them from being united in that demand. So that the Prince knew that nothing was more nece&s;&s;ary than that they &s;hould be gone <MILESTONE N="50"> out of the Ports of tho&s;e Provinces, and that the States wi&s;hed it ex|ceedingly.</P>
<P>WHILST <HI>Bamfield</HI> was about the Per&s;on of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> he
<PB N="155" REF="1750">
had infu&s;ed into him a marvellous de&s;ire to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Govern|ment of the Fleet: but the Duke was convinced with much ado, that it was neither &s;afe for his Highne&s;s, nor for his Father's Service, that he &s;hould be embarked in it: and <HI>Bamfield,</HI> by an e&s;pecial Command from the King, who had di&s;cover'd more of his foul practices than could be known to the Prince, was not &s;uffer'd to come any more near the Per&s;on of the Duke. So he return'd into <HI>England;</HI> wherehe was never called in que&s;tion for &s;tealing the Duke away. From this time the Duke, who was not yet above fifteen years of age, was &s;o far from de&s;iring to be with the Fleet, that, when there was once a Propo&s;ition, upon oc|ca&s;ion <MILESTONE N="10"> of a &s;uddain mutiny among&s;t the Seamen, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould go to&endq; <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> to appear among&s;t them, who profe&s;&s;ed great duty to his Highne&s;s, he was &s;o offended at it that he would not hear of it;</Q> and he had &s;till &s;ome Servant about him who took pains to per&s;wade him, <Q>&startq;that the Council had inclined the Prince to that de&s;ignation, out of ill will to his Highne&s;s, and that the Ships might deliver him up to&endq; the Parliament. So unplea&s;ant, and uncomfortable a Province had tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who, being of the King's Council, &s;erv'd both with great fidelity;</Q> every body who was un&s;atisfied (and no body was &s;atisfied) a&s;per&s;ing them, or &s;ome of them (for their prejudice was not equal to <MILESTONE N="20"> them all) in &s;uch a manner as touched the honour of the re&s;t, and mo&s;t reflected upon the King's own Honour, and Service.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> had a long de&s;ire to have that Command of the Fleet put into his hands; and that de&s;ire, though carried with all &s;e|crecy, had been the cau&s;e of &s;o many Intrigues, either to inflame the Seamen, or to cheri&s;h their froward inclinations, and encrea&s;e the pre|judice they had to <HI>Batten.</HI> The Atturney mention'd this to the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer, &s;hortly after his coming to the <HI>Hague,</HI> as a thing, he thought, that Prince might be induced to accept out of his Zeal to the King's Service, if he were invited to it; and thereupon was <MILESTONE N="30"> willing to debate, to what Per&s;on the Government of the Fleet could be committed, when it &s;hould &s;et Sail from that Port, and whither it &s;hould go. The Chancellor made no other An&s;wer to him, than <Q>&startq;that it was like to be a charge of much danger and hazard; that he mu&s;t not believe that any body would propo&s;e the undertaking it to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> or that the Prince would command him to undertake it; and that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary, that it &s;hould be fir&s;t re&s;olv'd, what the Fleet &s;hould do, and whither it &s;hould go, before a Commander &s;hould&endq; be appointed over it.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had waited &s;o many Months at <HI>Pa|ris</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of the Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>and the Lord</HI> Inch$quin <HI>in</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> for the Performance of tho&s;e gaudy promi&s;es which the Cardinal had made, after he &s;aw in what manner the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> him&s;elf was treated by him, and that he would not &s;uffer the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be applied to the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> in a conjuncture when very little would probably have done the work, upon the revolt of the Fleet, upon &s;o powerful In&s;urrections in <HI>England,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o many places of importance on the King's behalf, and when the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scot|land</HI> &s;eem'd &s;o united for his Maje&s;ties Service, and an Army of thirty thou&s;and Men were &s;aid to be even ready to march; I &s;ay, after he di&s;|cern'd that the Cardinal was &s;o far from giving any countenance, or <MILESTONE N="50"> warmth to their blooming hopes, that he left nothing undone towards the de&s;troying them, but the impri&s;oning the Prince; he concluded that it was in vain for him to expect any relief for <HI>Ireland.</HI> And there|fore
<PB N="156" REF="1760">
he re&s;olv'd, though he had neither Men, nor Money, nor Armes, nor Ammunition, all which had been very liberally promi&s;ed to tran&s;|port with him, he would yet tran&s;port his own Per&s;on, to what evi|dent danger &s;oever he was to expo&s;e it. Upon the full a&s;&s;urance the Car|dinal had given him of very &s;ub&s;tantial aid, he had a&s;&s;ured the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> <Q>&startq;that he would be pre&s;ent with him with notable &s;upply of Money, Armes, and Ammunition, and good Officers, and &s;ome com|mon&endq; Men</Q> (which were all in readine&s;s, if the Money had been paid to entertain them) and had likewi&s;e &s;ent to many, who had formerly &s;erv'd the King, and liv'd now quietly in the Enemies Quarters, upon <MILESTONE N="10"> the Articles which had been formerly granted the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;that they &s;hould expect his &s;peedy arrival.</Q></P>
<P>AND though he had, from time to time, &s;ent adverti&s;ements of the delays and ob&s;tructions he met with in the <HI>French</HI> Court, &s;o that he did allmo&s;t de&s;pair of any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from it, yet the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> had advanced too far to retire; and the Lord <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> who had been &s;uffi|ciently provoked, and contemned by him, was gone into <HI>England</HI> with full malice, and &s;uch information (which was not hard for him to be furni&s;hed with) as would put <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Army into &s;uch fury, that his Friends in the Parliament, who had hitherto &s;u&s;tain'd his cre|dit, <MILESTONE N="20"> would be very hardly able to &s;upport him longer. So that, as he was to expect a &s;torm from thence, &s;o he had a very &s;harp War to main|tain again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> led and commanded by the Pope's Nuntio; which War had been allways carried on in <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> with wonderful animo&s;ity, and with &s;ome circum&s;tances of bloodine&s;s, e&s;pecially again&s;t Prie&s;ts, and others of the Roman Clergy, that it was very hard to hope that tho&s;e People would live well together. And indeed the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were near rooted out of the Province of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> though they were powerful enough, and &s;trong in all the other Provinces. Hereupon the Lord <HI>In|chiquin,</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s, writ to the Lord of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>&startq;that <MILESTONE N="30"> though without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he would tran&s;port his own Per|&s;on:&endq; by who&s;e countenance and authority he pre&s;umed the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> might be divided, and brought to rea&s;on;</Q> and de&s;ired him, <Q>&startq;in the mean time, to &s;end to &s;uch of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> as had dependence upon him, and who, he knew, in their hearts did not wi&s;h well to the Nuntio, that they would &s;ecretly corre&s;pond with Him, and di&s;po&s;e their Friends and Depen|dents to concur in what might advance the King's Service; to which they did not know that he was inclined, but looked upon him, as the &s;ame malicious and irreconcilable Enemy to them, as he had allways&endq; appear'd to be to their Religion, more than to their Per&s;ons.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>FROM the time that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> enter'd into that bloody, and fooli&s;h <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the Affairs of the</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>about this time.</HI></NOTE> Rebellion, they had very different Affections, Intentions, and De&s;igns, which were every day improved in the carrying on the War. That part of them which inhabited the <HI>Pale,</HI> &s;o called from a circuit of ground contain'd in it, was originally of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Extraction, &s;ince the fir&s;t Plan|tation by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> many Ages pa&s;t. And though they were dege|nerated into the manners and barbarous Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and were as &s;tupidly tran&s;ported with the highe&s;t &s;uper&s;tition of the Romi&s;h Re|ligion, yet they had allways &s;teadily adher'd to the Crown, and per|form'd the duty of good Subjects during all tho&s;e Rebellions which the <MILESTONE N="50"> whole Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was &s;eldom without. And of that temper mo&s;t of the Province of <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> was: <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> was the mo&s;t planted with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of all the Provinces of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and though there
<PB N="157" REF="1770">
were many Noble Men of that Province who were of the olde&s;t <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> extractions, and of tho&s;e Families which had been Kings of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> yet many of them had intermarried with the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, and &s;o were better bred, and more civilized than the re&s;t of the old <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and liv'd regularly in obedience to the Government, and by connivance enjoyed the exerci&s;e of their Religion, in which they were very zealous, with freedom and liberty enough.</P>
<P>THE Seat of the old <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who retained the Rites, Cu&s;toms, Man|ners, and Ignorance of their Ance&s;tors, without any kind of reforma|tion in either, was the Province of <HI>Ul&s;ter;</HI> not the better cultivated by <MILESTONE N="10"> the neighbourhood of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who were planted upon them in great Numbers, with circum&s;tances of great Rigour. Here the Rebellion was fir&s;t contrived, cheri&s;hed, and enter'd upon with that horrid Barbarity, by the <HI>O Neils,</HI> the <HI>Macguyres,</HI> and the <HI>Macmahoons;</HI> and though it quickly &s;pread it &s;elf, and was entertain'd in the other Provinces (many Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality engaging them&s;elves by degrees in it for their own &s;ecurity, as they pretended, to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the undi&s;tingui&s;hing &s;everity of the Lords Ju&s;tices, who denounced the War again&s;t all <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> equally, if not again&s;t all Roman Catholicks; which kind of mixture and confu&s;ion was carefully declined in all the Orders <MILESTONE N="20"> and directions &s;ent to them out of <HI>England,</HI> but &s;o unskilfully pur&s;ued by the Ju&s;tices, and Council there, that as they found them&s;elves with|out any imployment or tru&s;t, to which they had chearfully offer'd their Service, they concluded, that the <HI>Engli&s;h Iri&s;h</HI> were as much in the jea|lou&s;y of the State as the other, and &s;o re&s;olv'd to prevent the danger by as unwarrantable Cour&s;es as the re&s;t had done) yet, I &s;ay, they were no &s;ooner enter'd into the War, which was &s;o generally embraced, but there appear'd a very great difference in the temper and purpo&s;es of tho&s;e who pro&s;ecuted it. They of the more moderate Party, and who&s;e main end was to obtain liberty for the exerci&s;e of their Religion, with|out <MILESTONE N="30"> any thought of declining their &s;ubjection to the King, or of invading his Prerogative, put them&s;elves under the Command of General <HI>Pre&s;ton:</HI> the other, of the fiercer and more &s;avage Party, and who never meant to return to their obedience of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and looked upon all the E&s;tates which had ever been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any of their An|ce&s;tors, though forfeited by their Trea&s;on and Rebellion, as ju&s;tly due to them, and ravi&s;hed from them by the Tyranny of the Crown, marched under the conduct of <HI>Owen Roe O Neile;</HI> both Generals of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Na|tion; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chara|cters of</HI> Pre|&s;ton <HI>and</HI> O Neile <HI>their chief Generals.</HI></NOTE> the one de&s;cended of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> extraction through many de&s;cents; the other purely <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and of the Family of <HI>Tyrone;</HI> both bred in the <MILESTONE N="40"> Wars of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and both eminent Commanders there, and of per|petual jealou&s;y of each other: the one of the more frank and open Na|ture; the other darker, le&s;s polite, and the wi&s;er Man; but both of them then in the head of more numerous Armies apart, than all the King's power could bring into the Field again&s;t either of them.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;parity in the temper and humour of tho&s;e People, fir&s;t di&s;|po&s;ed tho&s;e of the mo&s;t moderate to de&s;ire a Peace &s;hortly after the Re|bellion was begun, and produced the Ce&s;&s;ation that was fir&s;t enter'd into, and the Peace, which did not &s;oon enough en&s;ue upon it; and which, upon the matter, did provide only for the exerci&s;e of the Roman Ca|tholick <MILESTONE N="50"> Religion; but did that in &s;o immoderate and extravagant a manner, as made it obnoxious to all the Prote&s;tants of the King's Do|minions.</P>

OWEN <HI>Roe O Neile</HI> refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the Conditions, and Arti|cles of that Peace, though tran&s;acted and confirm'd by their Catholick Council at <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> which was the Repre&s;entative the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation had cho&s;en for the conduct of all the Coun&s;els for Peace and War, and to which they all avowed, and had hitherto paid an entire obedience. The Pope's Nuntio, who about that time came from <HI>Rome,</HI> and tran&s;|ported him&s;elf into that Kingdom, applied him&s;elf to <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and took that Party into his Protection; and &s;o wrought upon their Clergy, generally, that he broke that Peace, and pro&s;ecuted tho&s;e who had made it, with tho&s;e circum&s;tances which have been before remem|ber'd, <MILESTONE N="10"> and which nece&s;&s;itated the Lord Lieutenant to quit the King|dom, and to leave the City of <HI>Dublin</HI> in the hands of the Parliament; the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> having likewi&s;e refu&s;ed to con&s;ent, and &s;ubmit to that Peace, and continued to make the War &s;harply and &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in the Province of <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> whereof he was Pre&s;ident.

All which being well known to the Prince, and the Council, it was ea&s;ily concluded, <Q>&startq;that it was&endq; the be&s;t, if not the only place, the Fleet could repair to;</Q> though the danger in conducting it thither was vi&s;ible enough; and therefore they were glad that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had made that advance towards the Com|mand of it, and well &s;atisfied with the warine&s;s of the An&s;wer the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer gave to the Atturney <HI>Herbert.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THERE was in truth no body in view to whom the Charge of the Fleet could be committed but Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> for it was well known that the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> be&s;ides his being without much experience
<PB N="159" REF="1790">
of the Sea, was weary of it, and would by no means continue there; and the Seamen were too much broke loo&s;e from all kind of Order, to be reduced by a Commander of an Ordinary Rank. It was as true, that Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> at that time, was generally very ungracious in <HI>England,</HI> having the misfortune not to be much belov'd by the King's Party, and hated by the Parliament. This was an exception that was fore&s;een: there was no other choice of a place to which the Fleet mu&s;t be carried, but <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> and the pa&s;&s;age thither could not but be full of danger, in re&s;pect that the Parliament was without que&s;tion Ma&s;ter of the Sea (although the I&s;land of <HI>Silly</HI> being then under the King's Authority, and <MILESTONE N="10"> S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> being the Governour thereof, made that pa&s;&s;age &s;ome|thing the more &s;ecure) therefore this purpo&s;e was to be concealed as the la&s;t &s;ecret; there being great danger that the Seamen would rather carry all the Ships back again to the Parliament, than into <HI>Ireland;</HI> again&s;t which People they had made a War at Sea with circum&s;tances very barbarous; for they had &s;eldom given any Quarter, but the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> as well Merchants and Pa&s;&s;engers, as Mariners, which fell into their Hands, as hath been &s;aid before, were bound back to back and thrown into the Sea; &s;o that they could have no inclination to go into a Coun|try who&s;e People had been handled &s;o cruelly by them. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>HERE again appear'd another objection again&s;t the Per&s;on of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who would never endure to be &s;ubject to the Command of the Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom: and yet it &s;eem'd mo&s;t rea&s;onable that the Ships, whil&s;t they &s;tayed there, might be imployed towards the reducing of the other parts, which were in Rebellion: Be&s;ides that there was cau&s;e to fear, that the Prince would not live with that Amity towards the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as was nece&s;&s;ary for the publick Ser|vice. Notwith&s;tanding all this, when the little Stratagem of having Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> de&s;ired to take the Command of the Fleet upon him did not &s;ucceed, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> him&s;elf made the Propo&s;ition to the Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Ru|pert <HI>under|takes the Com|mand of the Prince's Fleet.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"> to take the Command of it upon him, and to carry it whither his Royal Highne&s;s would be plea&s;ed to direct. And then, the whole matter be|ing debated, nece&s;&s;ity made that to be coun&s;ellable, again&s;t which very many rea&s;onable objections might be made. So it was re&s;olv'd that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;hould be Admiral of that Fleet, and that it &s;hould Sail for <HI>Ireland.</HI> And the Charge, and Expedition appear'd to be the more hopeful by the pre&s;ence of good Officers, who had long Commanded in the Royal Navy: S^r <HI>Thomas Kettleby,</HI> whom the Prince made Captain of his own Ship the <HI>Antelope;</HI> S^r <HI>John Mennes,</HI> who had the Command of the <HI>Swallow,</HI> a Ship of which he had been Captain many years be|fore; <MILESTONE N="40"> and Colonel <HI>Richard Fielding,</HI> who was made Captain of the <HI>Con|&s;tant Reformation;</HI> all worthy and faithful Men to the King's Service, of long experience in the Service at Sea, and well known and lov'd by the Seamen. With the&s;e Officers, and &s;ome other Gentlemen, who were willing to &s;pend their time in that Service, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> went to <HI>Hel|voet Sluce,</HI> where the Ships lay, and &s;eem'd to be receiv'd by the Fleet with great joy. They all be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves in their &s;everal places to get the Ships ready for Sea, and all tho&s;e Provi&s;ions which were nece&s;|&s;ary, in making whereof there had not diligence enough been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHEN they took a &s;trict Survey of the Ships, the Carpenters were <MILESTONE N="50"> all of opinion, <Q>&startq;that the <HI>Convertine,</HI> a Ship of the &s;econd Rank, that carried &s;eventy Guns, was too old and decayed to be now &s;et out in a Winter Voyage, and in &s;o rough Seas, and that when a great deal of
<PB N="160" REF="1800">
Money &s;hould be laid out to mend her, &s;he would not be &s;erviceable&endq; or &s;afe.</Q> And it did appear, that when the Officers of the Navy had fitted her out at the beginning of the Summer, they had declared, <Q>&startq;that, when &s;he came in again, &s;he would not be fit for more u&s;e, but mu&s;t&endq; be layed upon the Stocks.</Q> Whereupon the Ship was brought into <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> upon the next Spring Tyde, and examined by the be&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> Carpenters and Surveyors; and all being of the &s;ame mind, in|formation was &s;ent by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to the Prince of the whole, who thereupon gave direction for the Sale of the Ordnance, and what&s;oever el&s;e would yield Money: all which was applied to the Victualling, and <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;etting out the re&s;t, without which no means could have been found to have done it; &s;o much ill husbandry had been u&s;ed, and &s;o much di|rect cheating in the managing all the Money that had been rai&s;ed upon the Prizes.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> remain'd all the time at <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> till all was ready to &s;et Sail, and had, with notable Vigour and Succe&s;s, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed two or three mutinies, in one of which he had been compelled to throw two or three Seamen over board by the &s;trength of his own Armes. All &s;ubordinate Officers were appointed, Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Sale of all Prize Goods, and Ships that &s;hould be taken, Trea&s;urers and Pay|ma&s;ters <MILESTONE N="20"> for i&s;&s;uing and paying and receiving all Monies; and an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment for the whole too regular and &s;trict to be ob&s;erv'd: and though all Per&s;ons imployed were well known, and approv'd by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and mo&s;t of them nominated by him&s;elf, yet he thought it fit after to change that con&s;titution, and by degrees brought the whole receipts, and i&s;&s;ues under his own management, and &s;ole Government. When all was ready he came to the <HI>Hague</HI> to take leave of the Prince, and re|turn'd, and about the beginning of <HI>December</HI> he &s;et Sail for <HI>Ireland,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sets Sail for</HI> Ireland <HI>in</HI> De|cember.</NOTE> met with good Prizes in the way, and arriv'd &s;afely at <HI>King&s;ale:</HI> nor had he been long gone out of <HI>Holland,</HI> when the Prince had a &s;hrew'd <MILESTONE N="30"> Evidence how un&s;ecure a long abode would have been there, by &s;ome Parliament Ships coming into that Road, and &s;ending their Men on Shore, who at noon day burnt the <HI>Convertine</HI> within the very Town of <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> nor did the States make any expo&s;tulation, or do any ju&s;tice for the Affront offer'd to them&s;elves, and their Government.</P>
<P>IN this calamitous State of Affairs there &s;eem'd to be no hope left, but that by Treaty the King might yet be re&s;tored to &s;uch a condition, that there might be tho&s;e Roots left in the Crown, from whence its former Power, and Prerogative might &s;prout out hereafter, and flouri&s;h. The Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Treaty arriv'd in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> upon the <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commi&s;|&s;ioners arrive in the I&s;le of</HI> Wight, Sept. 15.</NOTE> fifteenth day of <HI>September,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI> yet remain'd in his Northern Progre&s;s, and his Army divided into &s;everal parts for the fini&s;hing his Conque&s;t; which was the rea&s;on that all they who wi&s;hed ill to the Treaty, and that it might prove ineffectual, had u&s;ed and interpo&s;ed all the delays they could, that he might return before it begun, as they who wi&s;hed it might &s;ucceed well, were as &s;ollicitous, that it might be concluded before that time; which made them the le&s;s to in&s;i&s;t upon many particulars both in the Propo&s;itions, and the In&s;tructions, which they hoped might be more capable of remedies in the Treaty than be|fore it. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THEY &s;tayed three days in the I&s;land before the Teaty begun, which was time little enough to prepare the Hou&s;e for the King's reception at <HI>Newport,</HI> and adju&s;ting many circum&s;tances of the Treaty. In that
<PB N="161" REF="1810">
time they waited &s;everal times on the King, with great &s;hew of outward duty and re&s;pect; and though none of them dur&s;t adventure to &s;ee the King in private, they communicated freely with &s;ome of tho&s;e Lords, and others, who, with the Parliament's leave, were come to attend the King during the time of the Treaty. And &s;o they found means to ad|verti&s;e his Maje&s;ty of many particulars, which they thought nece&s;&s;ary for him to know; which made different impre&s;&s;ions upon him, as the information proceeded from Per&s;ons better or wor&s;e affected to him. And many of tho&s;e who had liberty to attend, were competent Con&s;i|derers of the truth of what they &s;aid. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE truth is there were among&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners many who had been carried with the violence of the &s;tream, and would be glad of tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions which the King would very chearfully have granted; an Act of Indemnity and Oblivion being what they were principally concern'd in. And of all the re&s;t, who were more pa&s;&s;ionate for the Militia, and again&s;t the Church, there was no Man, except S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> who did not de&s;ire that a Peace might be e&s;tabli&s;hed by that Treaty. For as all the other Lords de&s;ired, in their own Natures and Affections, no more than that their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions might never more be called to remem|brance; &s;o the Lord <HI>Say</HI> him&s;elf (who was as proud of his Quality, and <MILESTONE N="20"> of being di&s;tingui&s;hed from other Men by his Title, as any Man alive) well fore&s;aw what would become of his Peerage, if the Treaty proved ineffectual, and the Army &s;hould make their own model of the Govern|ment they would &s;ubmit to (as undoubtedly they re&s;olv'd &s;hortly to do) and therefore he did all he could to work upon the King to yield to what was propo&s;ed to him, and, afterwards, upon the Parliament, to be content with what his Maje&s;ty had yielded. But the advice they all gave, of what inclinations or affections &s;oever they were, was the &s;ame, <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould, forthwith, and without delaying it to the ex|piration&endq; of the Term a&s;&s;ign'd by the Parliament for the Treaty</Q> (which <MILESTONE N="30"> was forty days) <Q>&startq;yield to the full demands which were made in the&endq; Propo&s;itions.</Q> Their only Argument was, <Q>&startq;that, if he did not, or not do it quickly, the Army would proceed their own way; and had enough declared, that they would depo&s;e the King, change the Go|vernment,&endq; and &s;ettle a Republick by their own Rules and Invention.</Q> And this adverti&s;ement was as well believ'd by tho&s;e of the King's own Party, as by the Commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Treaty begun, the Commi&s;&s;ioners made it known to the King, <Q>&startq;that they could not admit that any Per&s;on &s;hould be pre|&s;ent in the Room where the Treaty &s;hould be in debate: that they <MILESTONE N="40"> were Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent from the Parliament to treat with his Ma|je&s;ty, and with Him alone; and that they might not permit any par|ticular and private Per&s;ons to oppo&s;e, or confer with them upon the&endq; demands of the Parliament.</Q> So that albeit the Parliament had given leave to the &s;everal Bi&s;hops, and other Divines, and to many Lawyers of eminency to wait on his Maje&s;ty, upon his de&s;ire, that they might in&s;truct and inform him in all difficult ca&s;es which related to Religion or the Law of the Land, they were like to be of little u&s;e to him now they were come, if they might not be pre&s;ent at the debate, and offer &s;uch advice to his Maje&s;ty, as upon emergent occa&s;ions he &s;hould &s;tand <MILESTONE N="50"> in need of, or require from them. At la&s;t they were contented, and his Maje&s;ty was obliged to be contented too, that they might &s;tand be|hind a Curtain, and hear all that was &s;aid, and when any &s;uch difficulty
<PB N="162" REF="1820">
occurr'd as would require con&s;ultation, his Maje&s;ty might retire to his Chamber, and call tho&s;e to him, with whom he would advi&s;e, to attend him, and might then return again into the Room for the Treaty, and declare his own Re&s;olution. This was the unequal and unrea&s;onable preliminary and condition, to which the King was compelled to &s;ubmit before the Treaty could begin.</P>
<P>THEY who had not &s;een the King in a Years time (for it was little le&s;s from the time that he had left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court) found his Coun|tenance extremely alter'd. From the time that his own Servants had been taken from him, he would never &s;uffer his hair to be cut, nor <MILESTONE N="10"> cared to have any new Cloaths; &s;o that his a&s;pect and appearance was very different from what it had u&s;ed to be: otherwi&s;e, his health was good, and he was much more chearful in his di&s;cour&s;es towards all Men than could have been imagined, after &s;uch mortification of all kinds. He was not at all dejected in his Spirits, but carried him&s;elf with the &s;ame Maje&s;ty he had u&s;ed to do. His hair was all gray, which, making all others very &s;ad, made it thought that he had &s;orrow in his coun|tenance, which appear'd only by that &s;hadow.</P>
<P>UPON <HI>Munday</HI> the 18^t^h of <HI>September,</HI> the Treaty begun, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners pre&s;ented their Commi&s;&s;ion to his Maje&s;ty, to treat with <MILESTONE N="20"> him per&s;onally, upon the Propo&s;itions pre&s;ented formerly at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, concerning the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> only, and upon &s;uch Propo&s;itions as &s;hould be offer'd either by his Maje&s;ty, or the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, according to their In&s;tructions <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Though the King knew very well, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;o totally &s;ubdued <HI>Scot|land,</HI> that he had not left any Man there in the lea&s;t Authority or Power, who did &s;o much as pretend to wi&s;h well to him, and that, in truth, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had as much the Command there as <HI>Argyle</HI> him&s;elf had, who was but his Creature, yet either to recover their broken Spirits, or to manife&s;t his own Royal Compa&s;&s;ion for them, he told the Commi&s;&s;ioners, <MILESTONE N="30"> <Q>&startq;that, when the Propo&s;itions had been deliver'd to him at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, the <HI>Scots</HI> Intere&s;t was &s;o involved in them, that it could be hardly &s;eparable from that of <HI>England:</HI> that it concern'd him, as King of both Kingdoms, to be ju&s;t and equal between both; and that though they had no Authority to treat for any thing but what related to <HI>England,</HI> yet He, who was to provide for the publick Peace (which could hardly be provided for, except the <HI>Scots</HI> were comprehended in this Treaty) did de&s;ire, that they would &s;end to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, to give a Pa&s;s for one of his Servants to go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to invite the Council there to &s;end &s;ome body authorized by that King|dom,&endq;</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"> who might treat with the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Parliament: and to that purpo&s;e his Maje&s;ty deliver'd them a Paper in writing to be &s;ent by them to the Parliament, telling them at the &s;ame time, <Q>&startq;that it was never his de&s;ire or meaning, that they &s;hould meddle in the Govern|ment of <HI>England,</HI> but only &s;hould treat concerning the Peace, to the end that that might be durable. But the Commi&s;&s;ioners alledged, that it was not in Their power to receive and tran&s;mit that, or any other Paper, to the Parliament, that referr'd to that Kingdom; and they be&s;ought him to give them leave, as an evidence of their Duty, to inform him of what ill con&s;equence the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of that Paper&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> at that time might be to the Treaty it &s;elf.</Q> Whereupon he declined &s;ending it by a Me&s;&s;enger of his own for the pre&s;ent (which he intended to have done) being unwilling to give any occa&s;ion of di&s;pute or jealou&s;y
<PB N="163" REF="1830">
&s;o early, and believing that after he &s;hould have gotten a good under|&s;tanding with the two Hou&s;es, in what was of immediate concernment to <HI>England,</HI> he &s;hould more effectually tran&s;mit that, or any other Pa|per, for the more ea&s;y compo&s;ing the affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>THEN they pre&s;ented their fir&s;t Propo&s;ition to his Maje&s;ty; <Q>&startq;that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t Pro|po&s;ition for re|voking all his Maje&s;ties De|clarations</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> he would revoke all Declarations, and Commi&s;&s;ions granted heretofore&endq; by him again&s;t the Parliament.</Q> <Q>Whereupon his Maje&s;ty de&s;ired, &startq;that he might &s;ee all the Propo&s;itions, they had to make to him, together; that he might the better con&s;ider what &s;atisfaction he could give them&endq; upon the whole: which they would not yield to without much im|portunity, <MILESTONE N="10"> and at la&s;t deliver'd them with reluctancy, as a thing they were not &s;ure they ought to do.</Q> And though their Commi&s;&s;ion referr'd to In&s;tructions, and his Maje&s;ty de&s;ired that he might have a view of tho&s;e, they peremptorily refu&s;ed to let him have a &s;ight of them; and only told him, <Q>&startq;that they were directed by their In&s;tructions, fir&s;t to treat upon the Propo&s;ition they had already pre&s;ented to him, concern|ing the revocation of the Declarations <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in the next place, of the Church, then of the Militia, and fourthly of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and after|wards&endq; of the re&s;t of the Propo&s;itions in order;</Q> and they declared like|wi&s;e that, <Q>&startq;by their In&s;tructions, they were not to enter upon any new <MILESTONE N="20"> Propo&s;itions, before they &s;hould have receiv'd his Maje&s;ties final An|&s;wer&endq; to what was fir&s;t propo&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>HEREUPON the King demanded of them, <Q>&startq;whether they had power and authority to recede from any particular contained in their Propo|&s;itions, or to con&s;ent to any alterations, if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould give&endq; them good rea&s;on &s;o to do?</Q> To which they An&s;wer'd very magi&s;te|rially, <Q>&startq;that they were ready to debate, to &s;hew how rea&s;onable their de&s;ires were, and that there could be no rea&s;on why they &s;hould alter, or recede from them; but if his Maje&s;ty did &s;atisfy them, they &s;hould&endq; do therein as they were warranted by their In&s;tructions.</Q> The&s;e limi|tations <MILESTONE N="30"> and re&s;trictions in a matter of that importance, which contain'd a new frame of Government, and an alteration of all Civil and Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titutions, allmo&s;t damped and &s;tifled all the hope his Ma|je&s;ty had entertain'd of good from this Treaty. However, he re&s;olv'd to try if con&s;enting to the &s;ub&s;tantial part of any Propo&s;ition would give them &s;atisfaction; and &s;o, without taking notice of the Preamble of that Propo&s;ition, which they had deliver'd to him, he declared in writing, which he deliver'd to them, <Q>&startq;that he was willing to grant the&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maje&s;ties An&s;wer to it.</NOTE> Body of their Propo&s;ition, that was to recal all Declarations <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> But they immediately return'd another Paper to him, in which they &s;aid, <MILESTONE N="40"> <Q>&startq;his Maje&s;ty had left unan&s;wer'd the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of their Propo|&s;ition,&endq; repeating the words in the Preamble,</Q> which recited, <Q>&startq;that the two Hou&s;es of Parliament had been nece&s;&s;itated to enter into a War in their ju&s;t and lawful defence; and that the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> had&endq; enter'd into a &s;olemn League and Covenant to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame;</Q> and &s;o ju&s;tifying all that had been done <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To all which they very vehemently pre&s;&s;ed <Q>&startq;his Maje&s;ties approbation and con&s;ent, as the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary foundation of a la&s;ting Peace, and the indi&s;pen&s;able expecta|tion of the two Hou&s;es and of the whole Kingdom; and that the two Hou&s;es, and the Kingdom, could not decline this particular demand, <MILESTONE N="50"> without which they could not believe them&s;elves to be in any &s;ecurity; &s;ince, by the Letter of the Law, they who had adhered to the Parlia|ment, might &s;eem Guilty of rai&s;ing War again&s;t the King, and &s;o to

<P>HOWEVER, this Propo&s;ition was of &s;o horrid and mon&s;trous a Na|ture, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;pute con|cerning the Prea$ble of it.</NOTE> &s;o contrary to the known truth, and &s;o de&s;tructive to ju&s;tice and government, that it &s;eem'd to naturalize Rebellion, and to make it cur|rent in the Kingdom to all Po&s;terity, that his Maje&s;ty could not forbear to tell them, <Q>&startq;that no Act of Parliament could make that to be true which was notoriou&s;ly known to be fal&s;e; that this Treaty mu&s;t be the foundation of the future peace and &s;ecurity, and what was herein provided for both could never be called in que&s;tion; that he was mo&s;t <MILESTONE N="30"> willing, that it &s;hould be made very penal to every Man to reproach another for any thing he had done during the late Troubles, upon&endq; what Provocation &s;oever.</Q> <Q>He put them in mind, &startq;that it was well known to &s;ome of them, that the Act of Indemnity in <HI>Scotland</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed when his Maje&s;ty was not there, nor any Commi&s;&s;ioner appoint|ed by him; that it was prepared, and drawn by his Atturney General of that Kingdom, who was then of the Party that was again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty; and therefore it was no wonder that he called tho&s;e of his own &s;ide, Loyal Subjects, and good Chri&s;tians, in the Preamble of that Act; <MILESTONE N="40"> which was never &s;een by his Maje&s;ty, though it was confirm'd indeed, with the other Acts which had pa&s;&s;ed in that di&s;orderly time, by his Maje&s;ty upon the conclu&s;ion of the Peace, and their return to their obedience; and that, when that &s;hould be the ca&s;e here, he would give them all the appellations they &s;hould de&s;ire, and as unque&s;tionable &s;e|curity&endq; as they could wi&s;h.</Q> To all which they made no other reply, and that unanimou&s;ly, <Q>&startq;but that they could not believe them&s;elves &s;e|cure,&endq; if that Preamble was not entirely con&s;ented to.</Q></P>
<P>THIS refractory ob&s;tinate adherence of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to their own Will, without any &s;hadow of rea&s;on, prevailed nothing upon the King; in&s;omuch as he was enclined to run the hazard of the pre&s;ent <MILESTONE N="50"> di&s;&s;olution of the Treaty, and to undergo all the inconveniencies and mi&s;chiefs which probably might attend it, rather than to &s;acrifice his

Honour, and the Ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, to their in&s;olent demand, until he had enter'd into a &s;erious deliberation with tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were about him, of who&s;e affections to him he had all a&s;&s;urance, and of the great abilities, and under&s;tanding of mo&s;t of them he had a very ju&s;t e&s;teem. They all repre&s;ented to him, from the conference they had with &s;uch of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who, they were confident, &s;poke to them as they thought and believ'd, <Q>&startq;that if there were no expedient found out to give more &s;atisfaction upon this fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, than his Maje&s;ty had yet offer'd, a&s;&s;oon as the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould give account of it to the two Hou&s;es, they would be pre&s;ently recalled; <MILESTONE N="10"> and the Treaty be at an end: and then it would be univer&s;ally declared and believ'd, how untrue &s;oever the a&s;&s;ertion was, that the King re|fu&s;ed to &s;ecure the Parliament, and all who had adhered to them, from a Pro&s;ecution by Law; upon which they thought it to no purpo&s;e to proceed farther in the Treaty: whereas if his Maje&s;ty had conde&s;cended to them in that particular, which concern'd the Lives and Fortunes of their whole Party in the Kingdom, they would have given him &s;uch &s;atisfaction in all other particulars, as a full and happy Peace mu&s;t&endq; have en&s;ued.</Q></P>
<P>THEN the Lawyers inform'd him, <Q>&startq;that his giving way to a recital <MILESTONE N="20"> in a new Law, which was not a Declaratory Law of what the Law was formerly in being, concerning the bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion, and only in a Preamble to a Law for recalling Declarations <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did not make their Actions lawful, if they were not &s;o before; nor did it take away from tho&s;e who had adhered to him, any defence or benefit the for|mer Laws had given to them; nor would his Party be in a wor&s;e con|dition than they had allways been: for his Maje&s;ty had allways offer'd, in all his Declarations, that they who follow'd him, and who were by them called Delinquents, &s;hould, at all times, &s;ubmit to a Trial by the Laws of the Land, and if they &s;hould be found guilty of any crime, they &s;hould not be protected by him. And it was evident, by their <MILESTONE N="30"> not pro&s;ecuting any one, &s;ince they were fallen into their hands, in any legal way, that they do not think their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions can be pu|ni&s;hed&endq; by Law.</Q></P>
<P>UPON the&s;e rea&s;ons, and the joynt advice and importunity of all about him, as well the Divines as the Lawyers, the King fir&s;t deliver'd a Paper in writing to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, in which he declared, <Q>&startq;that nothing that &s;hould be put in writing concerning any Propo&s;ition, or part of any Propo&s;ition, &s;hould be binding, prejudicial, or made u&s;e&endq; of, if the Treaty &s;hould break off without effect: and the Commi&s;|&s;ioners <MILESTONE N="40"> pre&s;ented another Paper in writing, in which they fully con&s;ented to that Declaration, in the very terms of the &s;aid Declaration.</Q> There|upon the King con&s;ented to pa&s;s the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, with the Preamble <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King con|&s;ents to it.</NOTE> to it, albeit, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that he well fore&s;aw the a&s;per&s;ions it would expo&s;e him to; yet he hoped his good Subjects would confe&s;s that it was but a part of the price he had paid for their benefit, and the peace of his&endq; Dominions.</Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Propo&s;ition being thus con&s;ented to as they could wi&s;h, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd Propo&s;ition concerning Re|ligion and the Church.</NOTE> they deliver'd their &s;econd concerning Religion and the Church; which comprehended, <Q>&startq;the utter aboli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy, and all juri&s;diction <MILESTONE N="50"> exerci&s;ed by Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Deans and Chapters, and alienating their Lands, which &s;hould be &s;old to the u&s;e and benefit of the Com|mon-wealth; the Covenant; which was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty to

take him&s;elf, and to impo&s;e upon all others: the Common-Prayer, and publick Liturgy of the Church to be aboli&s;hed, and taken away; and that the reformation of Religion, according to the Covenant, in &s;uch manner as both Hou&s;es had, or &s;hould agree, after con&s;ultation&endq; with Divines, &s;hould be &s;ettled by Act of Parliament: which,</Q> the King told them, <Q>&startq;exceeded the Implicit faith of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> which rather obliges her Pro&s;elytes to what &s;he Does hold, than to what &s;he&endq; Shall.</Q> <Q>It required &startq;the e&s;tabli&s;hing the Presbyterian Government,&endq; the Directory, the Articles of Chri&s;tian Religion</Q> (a Body whereof they pre&s;ented) <Q>&startq;the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Innovations in Churches; for the better <MILESTONE N="10"> advancement of Preaching, the ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day; a Bill again&s;t Pluralities and Non-re&s;idency; &s;everal Acts again&s;t Papi&s;ts; and&endq; the taking and impo&s;ing the Covenant.</Q></P>
<P>THIS pregnant Propo&s;ition, containing &s;o many mon&s;trous particu|lars, &s;ufficiently warn'd his Maje&s;ty, how impo&s;&s;ible it would be to give them &s;atisfaction in all; and therefore having, by con&s;enting to the en|tire fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, put it out of their power to break off the Treaty, and to tell the People, <Q>&startq;that the King, at the entrance into it, had&endq; denied to give them any &s;ecurity for their lives and fortunes, he thought it now fit to offer to the Commi&s;&s;ioners a Propo&s;ition of his own, that <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of|fers a Propo&s;i|tion of his own; which the Commi&s;|&s;ioners refu&s;e to &s;end to the Hou&s;es.</NOTE> both the Parliament, and the People, might clearly di&s;cern how much of his own Right and Dignity he would &s;acrifice for their Peace;</Q> and which, he thought, might prevent the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who might en|deavour, upon one &s;ingle Propo&s;ition, or part of a Propo&s;ition, to break the Treaty.</P>
<P>HIS own Propo&s;ition contained, in very few words, but three parti|culars: 1. <Q>&startq;That he might enjoy his Liberty: 2. That his Revenue&endq; might be re&s;tored to him: 3. That an Act of Oblivion might pa&s;s: which, he very well knew, would be mo&s;t grateful to tho&s;e who &s;eem'd to value it lea&s;t, as it would exempt his own Friends from many illegal, <MILESTONE N="30"> and unju&s;t vexations.</Q></P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;end it to the Hou&s;es, though they had no Authority to An&s;wer it them&s;elves. <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;it rather contained an An&s;wer to all their Propo&s;itions, than was a &s;in|gle Propo&s;ition of his own; and that the &s;ole end of making it, was&endq; to cajole the People;</Q> which, the King told them, <Q>&startq;better became Him&endq; to do than any body el&s;e.</Q> But when they peremptorily refu&s;ed to tran&s;mit it to the Hou&s;es, the King &s;ent an Expre&s;s of his own to de|liver <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;ends it by Me&s;&s;en|gers of his own; but it is voted un&s;ati&s;|factory.</NOTE> it; which being done, after &s;ome days deliberation, the Hou&s;es return'd no other An&s;wer to the King, <Q>&startq;than that his Propo&s;ition was&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> not &s;atisfactory.</Q> In the mean time the Commi&s;&s;ioners pre&s;s'd for his An&s;wer to the fir&s;t part of their Propo&s;ition, for the aboli&s;hing of Bi&s;hops. It would be very tedious and unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;et down at large the di&s;|pute, and Arguments which were u&s;ed on both &s;ides upon this Subject. The Commi&s;&s;ioners, who would not &s;uffer any of the King's Servants to be &s;o much as pre&s;ent when any thing of the Treaty was agitated, thought fit now to let loo&s;e their own Clergy upon the King; who was much better ver&s;ed in the Argument than They were.</P>
<P>THAT which they urged mo&s;t, was the common Allegations <Q>&startq;that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mini|&s;ters di&s;pute with the King about the Bi|&s;hops.</NOTE> Bi&s;hop and Presbyter in the Scripture language &s;ignified one and the <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;ame thing: that, if the Apo&s;tles exerci&s;ed a larger juri&s;diction, it had been granted to them as Apo&s;tles, and concern'd not their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to whom no &s;uch Authority had been granted, nor any &s;uperiority over&endq;
<PB N="167" REF="1870">
other Presbyters, who were of the &s;ame Function with them.</Q> Then they inveighed vehemently again&s;t <Q>&startq;Lords Bi&s;hops; their Pride, and&endq; Lu&s;tre;</Q> and they all behaved them&s;elves with that rudene&s;s, as if they meant to be no longer &s;ubject to a King, no more than to a Bi&s;hop. And two of them very plainly and fiercely told the King, <Q>&startq;that if he did&endq; not con&s;ent to the utter aboli&s;hing of Epi&s;copacy, he would be damn'd;</Q> with which his Maje&s;ty was not moved. The Men, <HI>Jenkins</HI> and <HI>Spur|&s;tow,</HI> liv'd after the return of King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, and, according to the mode&s;ty of that race of People, came to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ties hand, and continued the &s;ame Zeal in all &s;editious attempts. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE King pre&s;s'd them with tho&s;e Texts of Scripture which have been con&s;tantly urged by tho&s;e who maintain the <HI>jus Divinum</HI> of Bi&s;hops, the Authority of the Fathers, and the Government of all Chri&s;tian Churches for fifteen hundred years, and particularly of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before and &s;ince the Reformation, by con&s;tant and uniform practice and u&s;age; which could not but be by them&s;elves acknow|ledged to have been by Bi&s;hops. The Commi&s;&s;ioners reliev'd their ill manner'd Clergy, and urged, <Q>&startq;that what&s;oever was not of Divine in&s;ti|tution might very Lawfully be alter'd; for if it had its Original from Men, it might by Men be changed, or rever&s;ed: that Epi&s;copacy as <MILESTONE N="20"> it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Church by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> was not that Epi&s;copacy that was mention'd or pre&s;cribed in Scripture; and there|fore the Laws which &s;upported it, might be ju&s;tly taken away; which, they &s;aid, was the rea&s;on that had induced many Men who were not Enemies to Epi&s;copacy, to take the Covenant; which obliged them&endq; to take the pre&s;ent Hierarchy away.</Q></P>
<P>IN a word they urged, <Q>&startq;the practice of other Reform'd Churches, and that his Maje&s;ty in&s;i&s;ting upon the pre&s;ervation of Epi&s;copacy, as e&s;&s;en|tially&endq; nece&s;&s;ary, was to reproach and condemn Them.</Q> To which he An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that both <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Beza,</HI> and mo&s;t learned Men of the <MILESTONE N="30"> Reform'd Churches, had approv'd, and commended the Epi&s;copal Go|vernment in <HI>England;</HI> and many of them had bewailed them&s;elves,&endq; that they were not permitted to retain that Government.</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES all their Arguments in publick, which his Maje&s;ty with wonderful acutene&s;s fully An&s;wer'd, and deliver'd his An&s;wers in writing to them (which none of them ever after undertook to reply unto) they found means in private to adverti&s;e the King, that is, &s;uch of them who were known to wi&s;h well to him, <Q>&startq;that they were of his Maje&s;ties judge|ment with reference to the Government, which they hoped might yet be pre&s;erv'd, but not by the method his Maje&s;ty pur&s;ued: that all the <MILESTONE N="40"> rea&s;onable hope of pre&s;erving the Crown, was in dividing the Parlia|liament from the Army; which could be only done by his giving &s;a|tisfaction in what was demanded with reference to the Church; which would unite the Parliament in it &s;elf, &s;ome few Per&s;ons excepted, and the City to the Parliament; where the Presbyterians were mo&s;t power|ful; and this being done, the Parliament would immediately have power to reform their Army; and to disband tho&s;e who would not be reform'd: That then the King would be removed to <HI>London,</HI> to per|fect that by his own pre&s;ence in Parliament, which &s;hould be prepared by this Treaty; and then the wording tho&s;e Bills, and the formality <MILESTONE N="50"> of pa&s;&s;ing them, would give opportunity for many alterations; which, being now attempted, would de&s;troy all, and reconcile the Parliament to the Army; which would de&s;troy the King: But then, what the
<PB N="168" REF="1880">
King urged as matter of Con&s;cience in him&s;elf would find re&s;pect, re|verence,&endq; and concurrence.</Q> No doubt they who did make the&s;e In&s;i|nuations, did in truth believe them&s;elves; and did think, as well as wi&s;h, that the &s;equel would be &s;uch as they foretold. But that which had more Authority with the King, and which no body about him could put him in mind of, becau&s;e none of them had been Privy to it, was the remembrance of what he had promi&s;ed concerning the Church to the <HI>Scots,</HI> in the Engagement at the I&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> which he could not but conclude was well known to many of the Presbyterians in <HI>England:</HI> and he thought, that whatever he had promi&s;ed to do then, upon the bare hope and probability of rai&s;ing an Army, he might rea&s;onably now offer when that Army was de&s;troyed, and no hope left of rai&s;ing an|other. And thereupon he did, with much reluctancy, offer the &s;ame <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Conce&s;&s;ions on this point.</NOTE> he had then promi&s;ed to do; which was, <Q>&startq;to &s;u&s;pend Epi&s;copacy for three years, and then upon con&s;ultation with Divines, among&s;t which he would nominate twenty to be pre&s;ent, and to con&s;ult with them, &s;uch a Government of the Church as &s;hould be agreed upon might be e&s;tabli&s;hed: that he would not force any Man to take the Covenant, and would have the Privilege of his own Chapel to u&s;e the Common Prayer, and ob&s;erve the &s;ame wor&s;hip he had u&s;ed to do; and that all <MILESTONE N="$$"> Per&s;ons, who de&s;ired it, might have liberty to take the Covenant, and&endq; to u&s;e the Directory;</Q> in fine, he con&s;ented to all that he had offer'd in that Engagement with reference to the Government of the Church; and likewi&s;e, <Q>&startq;that Money &s;hould be rai&s;ed upon the &s;ale of the Church Lands, and only the old Rent &s;hould be re&s;erv'd to the ju&s;t owners and&endq; their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</Q> The&s;e, with &s;ome other Conce&s;&s;ions of le&s;s impor|tance, which related to other Branches of the &s;ame Propo&s;ition, <HI>magna inter &s;u&s;piria,</HI> he deliver'd to the Commi&s;&s;ioners as his final An&s;wer; which the Major part of them, did then believe would have pre&s;erv'd his Maje&s;ty from farther importunity and vexation in that particular. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE next Propo&s;ition was concerning the Militia; which was their <NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Pro|po&s;ition con|cerning the Militia.</NOTE> Darling; and di&s;tingui&s;hed the <HI>Scots</HI> from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Presbyterians; the former never de&s;iring to invade that unque&s;tionable Prerogative of the Crown; the latter being in truth as fond of it (and as refractory without it) as of Presbytery it &s;elf; and in that particular concurr'd even with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and made little doubt of &s;ubduing him by it in a &s;hort time. In this demand they exerci&s;ed their u&s;ual mode&s;ty, and to abridge the &s;ub&s;tance of it in few words, they required <Q>&startq;a power to keep up the pre&s;ent Army, and to rai&s;e what other Armies they plea&s;ed for the future; which gave them Authority over the Per&s;ons of all Subjects <MILESTONE N="40"> of what degree or quality &s;oever. Secondly, a power to rai&s;e Money for the u&s;e and maintenance of tho&s;e Forces, in &s;uch a manner, and&endq; by &s;uch ways and means, as they &s;hould think fit.</Q> And hereby they had had the di&s;po&s;al of the E&s;tates and Fortunes of all Men without re|&s;traint, or limitation. <Q>Thirdly, &startq;all Forces by Land and Sea to be ma|naged,&endq; and di&s;po&s;ed as They &s;hould think fit, and not otherwi&s;e.</Q> All this mode&s;t Power and Authority <Q>&startq;mu&s;t be granted to the Lords and&endq; Commons for twenty years.</Q> And, as if this had not been enough, they required farther, <Q>&startq;that in all Ca&s;es, when the Lords and Commons &s;hall declare the &s;afety of the Kingdom to be concern'd, unle&s;s the King give <MILESTONE N="50"> his Royal A&s;&s;ent to &s;uch a Bill as &s;hall be tender'd to him for rai&s;ing Money, the Bill &s;hall have the force of an Act of Parliament, as if he&endq; had given his Royal A&s;&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="1890">
THERE were other particulars included, of power to the City of <HI>London</HI> over the Militia, and for the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> of no impor|tance to the King, if he once di&s;po&s;ed, and granted the other as was re|quired, nor need he take care to whom the re&s;t belonged. Here the King was to con&s;ider whether he would wholely grant it, or wholely deny it, or whether he might rea&s;onably hope &s;o to limit it, that They might have Authority enough to plea&s;e them, and He re&s;erve &s;ome to him&s;elf for his own &s;ecurity. The King had thought with him&s;elf, upon revolving all Expedients, which he had too long warning to ruminate upon, to propo&s;e <Q>&startq;that the Inhabitants of every County &s;hould be the <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;tanding Militia of the Kingdom, to be drawn out of the Counties&endq; upon any occa&s;ions which &s;hould occur;</Q> which would prevent all ex|ce&s;&s;ive Taxes and Impo&s;itions, when they were to be paid by them&s;elves. But he quickly di&s;cern'd that &s;uch a Propo&s;ition would be pre&s;ently called a Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Army, and &s;o put an end to all other Ex|pedients. Then he thought of limiting the extravagant power in &s;uch a manner, that it might not appear &s;o mon&s;trous to all intents and pur|po&s;es what&s;oever; and therefore propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that none &s;hould be com|pelled <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ki$$$ An&s;wer</NOTE> to &s;erve in the War again&s;t their Wills, but in ca&s;e of an Inva|&s;ion by Foreign Enemies: that the power concerning the Land Forces <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;hould be exerci&s;ed to no other Purpo&s;es, than for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Forces which might at any time be rai&s;ed without the Authority and C$$$ent of the Lords and Commons, and for the keeping up, and $$ntaining the Forts and Garri&s;ons, and the pre&s;ent Army, &s;o long as it &s;hould be thought fit by both Hou&s;es of Parliament: That what Monies &s;hould at any time be thought nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed, &s;hould be rai&s;ed by general and equal Taxes, and Impo&s;itions; and la&s;tly, that all Patents and Commi&s;&s;ions to the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid might be made in the King's name, by Warrant &s;ignified by the Lords and Commons, or &s;uch other &s;ignification as they &s;hould direct, and&endq; au|thori&s;e.</Q> <MILESTONE N="$$"></P>
<P>THESE Limitations were &s;ent to the Parliament, who, according to the method they had a&s;&s;umed, &s;oon voted <Q>&startq;that the Me&s;&s;age was&endq; un&s;a|tis$actory. <NOTE PLACE="marg">This $Word$ is the Parlia|ment un&s;ati&s;|$actory.</NOTE></Q> Hereupon, that he might at lea&s;t leave &s;ome Monument and Record of his care and tenderne&s;s of his People (for after his ex|torted conce&s;&s;ions to the &s;o great prejudice of the Church, he never con|&s;ider'd what might be dangerous to his own Per&s;on) he deliver'd his con|&s;ent to the Propo&s;ition it &s;elf to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, with a Preamble to this purpo&s;e; <Q>&startq;that whereas their Propo&s;ition concerning the Mili|tia, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King $on|&s;ents to it wi$$ a P$$a$|ble.</NOTE> required a far larger power over the Per&s;ons and E&s;tates of his <MILESTONE N="40"> Subjects, than had been ever hitherto warranted by the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom, yet in regard the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions might require more, and tru&s;ting in his two Hou&s;es of Parliament, that they would make no farther u&s;e of the power therein mention'd, after the pre&s;ent di&s;tempers &s;hould be &s;ettled, than &s;hould be agreeable to the legal Exerci&s;e thereof in times pa&s;t, and for the purpo&s;es particularly mention'd in their Propo&s;ition, and to give &s;atisfaction to his two Hou&s;es of Parliament that he intends a full &s;ecurity to them, and to expre&s;s his real de&s;ires to &s;ettle the Peace of the Kingdom, his Maje&s;ty doth con&s;ent to the Propo&s;ition concerning the Militia as it was&endq; de|&s;ired. <MILESTONE N="50"></Q> This the Commi&s;&s;ioners did by no means like, nor would ac|quie&s;ce in, and ailedged, <Q>&startq;that as the Conce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be the Subject of an Act of Parliament, &s;o this Preamble mu&s;t be a part of it, and would

admini&s;ter occa&s;ion of difference and di&s;pute upon the interpretation of it; which being &s;o clearly fore&s;een, ought not to be admitted in Any Act of Parliament, much le&s;s in &s;uch a One as is to be the prin|cipal&endq; Foundation of a la&s;ting Peace of the Kingdom.</Q> After much vexa|tion of this kind, and importunity of Friends, as well as of Enemies, and being allmo&s;t as weary of denying as of granting, he &s;uffer'd the <NOTE PLACE="marg">At la&s;t con|&s;ents to it without the Preamble.</NOTE> Preamble to be left out, and his con&s;ent to be deliver'd without it.</P>
<P>IT may be well wonder'd at, that, after having &s;o far complied with the&s;e three Propo&s;itions, there &s;hould be any pau&s;e or hae&s;itation in the debate of the re&s;t. For in that concerning the Church, and the other <MILESTONE N="$$"> concerning the Militia, both the Church and the Militia of <HI>Ireland</HI> followed the Fate of <HI>England,</HI> and were in effect comprehended in the &s;ame Propo&s;itions: &s;o that there remain'd nothing more with reference to that Kingdom, <Q>&startq;but declaring the Peace that was made there with&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fourth Propo&s;ition concerning</HI> Ireland</NOTE> the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> to be void;</Q> which they pre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, as if they had obtain'd nothing; although his Maje&s;ty referr'd the carrying on the War to them, and told them, <Q>&startq;that he knew nothing of the Peace, which had been made during his Impri&s;onment, when he could re|ceive no Adverti&s;ement of what was doing, or done; and therefore he was content that it &s;hould be broken, and the War be carried on in&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;uch a manner as &s;hould plea&s;e Them;</Q> which was all one to their ends and purpo&s;es, as what they de&s;ired. But this did by no means plea&s;e them. If the Peace were not declared to be actually void, they could not &s;o ea&s;ily take that vengeance of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> as they re|&s;olv'd to do. Yet after all the&s;e general conce&s;&s;ions, which &s;o much con|cern'd Him&s;elf, and the Publick, and when the nece&s;&s;ity that had obliged him to that unwilling complyance, might well have excu&s;ed him for &s;atisfying them in all the re&s;t of their demands, when they pre&s;&s;ed his con&s;ent to what only concern'd private and particular Per&s;ons, as the revoking all Honours and Grants of Offices which he had conferr'd upon <MILESTONE N="$$"> tho&s;e who had &s;erv'd him faithfully, and to except many of them from Pardon, and leave them to the unmerciful cen&s;ure of the two Hou&s;es, both for their Lives and Fortunes; to &s;ubmit others to pay, for their Delinquency in obeying and &s;erving him, a full moiety of all they were worth; to deprive others of their practice in their &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions, and Functions (which expo&s;ed all the Lawyers and Divines who had been faithful to him, to utter ruin) it cannot be expre&s;t with what grief, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some other particulars the King at fir&s;t &s;ticks at:</NOTE> and trouble of mind he receiv'd tho&s;e importunities; and without doubt, he would at that time with much more willingne&s;s have died, than &s;ub|mitted to it; <Q>but the Argument &startq;&endq;that he had done &s;o much, was now <MILESTONE N="40"> pre&s;s'd upon him</Q> (by his Friends, and tho&s;e who were to receive as much prejudice as any by his doing it) <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould do more; and &s;ince he had conde&s;cended to many things which gave him&s;elf no &s;a|tisfaction, he would give &s;o full &s;atisfaction to the Parliament, that He might receive that benefit, and the Kingdom that Peace and&endq; &s;e|curity he de&s;ired.</Q></P>
<P>MANY Adverti&s;ements came from his Friends in <HI>London,</HI> and from other places, <Q>&startq;that it was high time that the Treaty were at an end, and that the Parliament had all his Maje&s;ties An&s;wers before them, to de|termine what they would do upon them, before the Army drew nearer <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>London;</HI> which, infallibly, it would &s;hortly do, a&s;&s;oon as tho&s;e in the&endq; North had fini&s;hed their work.</Q> It was now near the end of <HI>October,</HI> and the appointed time for the conclu&s;ion of the Treaty was the fourth of
<PB N="171" REF="1910">
<HI>November;</HI> and &s;o after all importunities, as well of tho&s;e who were to &s;uffer, as of tho&s;e who were to triumph in their &s;ufferings, his Ma|je&s;ties con&s;ent was procured to mo&s;t that was demanded in the re&s;t of <NOTE PLACE="marg">But con&s;ents at la&s;t.</NOTE> the Propo&s;itions; the King, and all Men, conceiving the Treaty to be at an end.</P>
<P>THE King had, about the middle of <HI>October,</HI> again deliver'd his own Propo&s;ition for his Liberty, his Revenue, and an Act of Oblivion, to the Commi&s;&s;ioners; which they receiv'd. And though, at the beginning of the Treaty, they had refu&s;ed to tran&s;mit it to the Hou&s;es, yet now, after &s;o many conce&s;&s;ions, they thought fit to &s;end it; and did &s;o a&s;&s;oon <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commi&s;|&s;ioners now &s;end the King's own Propo&s;i|tion to the Parliament.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> as they receiv'd it. But no An&s;wer was return'd. Hereupon, when the Treaty was within two days of expiring, his Maje&s;ty demanded of them, <Q>&startq;whether they had receiv'd any In&s;tructions to treat upon, or to give an An&s;wer to his own Propo&s;ition, which he had deliver'd to them &s;o long &s;ince? or whether they had receiv'd any Order to prolong the&endq; Treaty?</Q> To which they An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;they had not as to either.</Q> And when he asked them the &s;ame Que&s;tion, the very la&s;t hour of the limited time, they made the &s;ame An&s;wer. So that the whole forty days a&s;&s;ign'd for the Treaty were expired, before they vouch&s;afed to return any An|&s;wer to the &s;ingle Propo&s;ition the King had made to them. However <MILESTONE N="20"> they told him, <Q>&startq;they had receiv'd new Command to make fre&s;h in&s;tance to his Maje&s;ty, that he would forthwith publi&s;h a Declaration again&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They require a Declaration of the King a|gain&s;t the Marquis of</HI> Ormond.</NOTE> the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who had very lately declared, that he had Authority to make a Peace with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels; and was then treat|ing with them to that purpo&s;e. To which his Maje&s;ty An&s;wer'd, that it was not rea&s;onable to pre&s;s him to publi&s;h any Declaration <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maje&s;ties An&s;wer.</NOTE> again&s;t the Marquis; &s;ince that if the Treaty &s;hould end happily, the de&s;ires of the two Hou&s;es were &s;atisfied by the Conce&s;&s;ions he had al|ready&endq; made;</Q> and &s;o adhered to his fir&s;t An&s;wer. And conceiving the Treaty to be clo&s;ed, he de&s;ired the Commi&s;&s;ioners, <Q>&startq;that &s;ince He had <MILESTONE N="30"> departed from &s;o much of his own Right to give his two Hou&s;es &s;ati&s;|faction, They would be a means that he might be pre&s;&s;ed no farther; &s;ince the few things he had not &s;atisfied them in, had &s;o near relation to his Con&s;cience, that, with the Peace of that, he could not yield far|ther;&endq;</Q> and de&s;ired them <Q>&startq;to u&s;e the &s;ame eloquence, and abilities, by which they had prevailed with Him, in repre&s;enting to the two Hou&s;es the &s;ad condition of the Kingdom, if it were not pre&s;erv'd by this&endq; Treaty.</Q> And &s;o concluded with many gracious expre&s;&s;ions for their Per&s;onal civilities, and other kind Expre&s;&s;ions; which made impre&s;&s;ion upon all of them who had any Bowels. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>ALL this being pa&s;t, and the King believing and expecting that the Commi&s;&s;ioners would take their leave of him the next morning, they came the &s;ame night to inform him, <Q>&startq;that they had then receiv'd new Orders and In&s;tructions for the continuing and enlarging the Treaty&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia-|ment enlarge$ the Treaty</HI> 14 <HI>days longer</HI></NOTE> for fourteen days longer;</Q> for which his Maje&s;ty was nothing glad; nor did they in the Hou&s;es who wi&s;hed well to him, de&s;ire that Prolon|gation. For it was ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd, that it was moved and pro&s;ecuted only by them who did not intend that the Treaty it &s;elf &s;hould have any good effect; which they were not yet ready and prepared enough to prevent, the Army not having yet fini&s;hed what they were to do in <MILESTONE N="50"> all places; and was con&s;ented to unskilfully, by tho&s;e who thought the continuance of the Treaty was the be&s;t &s;ign that both &s;ides de&s;ired Peace: and it quickly appear'd, by the new in&s;tances they made, that delay was
<PB N="172" REF="1920">
their only bu&s;ine&s;s. The Commi&s;&s;ioners, with new importunity, and bit|terne&s;s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commi&s;|&s;ioners renew their Demand about</HI> Or|mond.</NOTE> begun upon their new In&s;tructions, <Q>&startq;that the King would im|mediately&endq; publi&s;h the Declaration again&s;t the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI></Q> without any other rea&s;ons than tho&s;e which he had An&s;wer'd before. His Maje&s;ty An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;there was no other difference between them <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maje&s;ties An&s;wer.</NOTE> but in point of time, whether pre&s;ently, or at the conclu&s;ion of the Peace: upon the Peace, they had the &s;ub&s;tance of their de&s;ire already granted; and if there were no Peace, they had rea&s;on to believe that&endq; no Declaration he &s;hould make would be believed or obeyed;</Q> and &s;o adhered to what he had An&s;wer'd formerly. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THEN they declared, <Q>&startq;that the Parliament was not &s;atisfied with <NOTE PLACE="marg">They urge far|ther about the Church.</NOTE> his Conce&s;&s;ions with reference to the Church; that the Presbyterian Government could be exerci&s;ed with little profit, or comfort, if it &s;hould appear to be &s;o &s;hort-liv'd as to continue but for three years; and that they mu&s;t therefore pre&s;s the utter extirpating the Function&endq; of Bi&s;hops.</Q> Then, the perfect and entire alienation of their Lands was in&s;i&s;ted on; whereas by the King's Conce&s;&s;ions, the old Rent was &s;till re&s;erv'd to them. <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;the Parliament did not intend to force,&endq; but only to rectify his Con&s;cience;</Q> and, to that end, they added more rea&s;ons to convince him in the &s;everal points. They repeated their old <MILESTONE N="20"> di&s;tinction between the Scripture-Bi&s;hop, and the Bi&s;hop by Law. For the ab&s;olute alienation of their Lands, they urged many Precedents of what had been done in former times upon convenience, or nece&s;&s;ity, not &s;o vi&s;ible and manife&s;t as appear'd at pre&s;ent; and concluded with their u&s;ual threat, <Q>&startq;that the con&s;equence of his denial would be the con|tinuance&endq; of the publick di&s;turbances.</Q></P>
<P>To all which his Maje&s;ty An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that, for the Presbyterian Go|vernment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's An&s;wer.</NOTE> they might remember that their own fir&s;t Order for the &s;ettling it, was only for three years; which they then thought a com|petent time for a Probationary Law, that contain'd &s;uch an alteration <MILESTONE N="30"> in the State; and therefore they ought to think the &s;ame now: and that it might be longer lived than three years, if it would in that time bear the te&s;t, and examination of it; and that nothing could be a greater honour to that di&s;cipline, than its being able to bear that te&s;t&endq; and examination.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he was well plea&s;ed with their Expre&s;&s;ion, that they did not intend to force his Con&s;cience; yet the manner of pre&s;&s;ing him looked very like it, after he had &s;o &s;olemnly declared that it was again&s;t his Con&s;cience; that he did concur with them in their di&s;tinction of Bi&s;hops, and if they would pre&s;erve the Scripture-Bi&s;hop,&endq; he would take away the Bi&s;hop by Law.</Q> <Q>He con&s;e&s;&s;ed, &startq;that <MILESTONE N="40"> Nece&s;&s;ity might ju&s;tify, or excu&s;e many things, but it could never warrant him to deprive the Church of God of an Order in&s;tituted for continual u&s;e, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Lawful Mini&s;ters&endq; in the Church.</Q> For the point of &s;acrilege, <Q>he &s;aid, &startq;the concurrent opinion of all Divines was a much better information to his Con&s;cience,&endq; what is &s;acrilege, than any Precedents or Law of the Land could be.</Q> Upon the whole matter, he adhered to his former An&s;wer in all the particulars, and concluded, <Q>&startq;that he could with more comfort ca&s;t him|&s;elf upon God's goodne&s;s to &s;upport him in, and defend him from all Afflictions, how great &s;oever, that might befal him, than deprive <MILESTONE N="50"> him&s;elf of the inward tranquillity of his mind, for any Politick con&s;i|deration&endq; that might &s;eem to be a means to re&s;tore him.</Q></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be forgotten, that the la&s;t day, when the Treaty was to

<P>THE two Propo&s;itions they &s;ent for one days work, were, the fir&s;t, <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One concern|ing</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> concerning <HI>Scotland;</HI> the other, concerning the Church; which they did not think they had yet de&s;troyed enough. <Q>For <HI>Scotland,</HI> they de|manded &startq;the King's con&s;ent, to confirm by Act of Parliament &s;uch Agreements as &s;hould be made by both Hou&s;es with that Kingdom, in the &s;ecurity of &s;uch thereof who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted or adhered to tho&s;e of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and for the &s;ettling and pre&s;erving a happy and durable Peace between the two Nations, and for the mutual de|fence&endq; of each other.</Q> The King put them in mind, <Q>&startq;that at the be|ginning <NOTE PLACE="marg">To that the King's An|&s;wer.</NOTE> of the Treaty they had inform'd him, that their Commi&s;&s;ion was only to treat concerning <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that they had <MILESTONE N="40"> no Authority to meddle in any thing that related to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that they had thereupon refu&s;ed to receive a Paper from him, which was to pre&s;erve the Intere&s;t of that Kingdom; and demanded of them,&endq; whether their Commi&s;&s;ion was enlarged?</Q> which they confe&s;s'd <Q>&startq;was not; and that they had pre&s;ented that Paper only in obedience to the&endq; Order they had receiv'd.</Q> So that the King ea&s;ily under&s;tood that the end was only that they might have occa&s;ion to publi&s;h, <Q>&startq;that the King had rejected what&s;oever was tender'd to him on the behalf of the King|dom&endq; of <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> To prevent which, <Q>he An&s;wer'd, &startq;that as he would joyn in any Agreement, to be confirm'd by Act of Parliament, for <MILESTONE N="50"> the &s;ettling and pre&s;erving a happy and durable Peace between the two Nations, and for their mutual defence of each other under him as King of both; &s;o he would &s;ecure all who had been formerly engaged with
<PB N="175" REF="1950">
them; but for any new Engagement, or Confederacy, which they would make hereafter, he would fir&s;t know what it was, and be ad|vi&s;ed&endq; with in the making it, before he would promi&s;e to confirm it.</Q> The other bu&s;ine&s;s with reference to the Church gave him much more <NOTE PLACE="marg">The other tou$hing $Span$.</NOTE> trouble. <Q>The Commi&s;&s;ioners pre&s;s'd him &startq;to con&s;ider the Exigence of time, and that there was not a whole day left to determine the Fate of the Kingdom; and that nothing could unite the Coun&s;els of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed and de&s;ired Peace, and to live happily under his Sub|jection and obedience, again&s;t the bold attempts of the Army, which had enough declared and manife&s;ted what their intention was, but &s;a|tisfying&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> the Hou&s;es fully in what they demanded in that particular.</Q> His own Council, and the Divines, be&s;ought him <Q>&startq;to con&s;ider the &s;afety of his own Per&s;on, even for the Church's and his People's &s;akes, who had &s;ome hope &s;till left whil&s;t He &s;hould be pre&s;erv'd, which could not but be attended with many Ble&s;&s;ings: whereas, if He were de&s;troyed, there was &s;carce a po&s;&s;ibility to pre&s;erve them: that the moral and un|avoidable nece&s;&s;ity that lay upon him, obliged him to do any thing that was not Sin; and that, upon the mo&s;t prudential thoughts which occurr'd to them, the Order which He, with &s;o much Piety and Zeal, endeavour'd to pre&s;erve, was much more like to be de&s;troyed by his <MILESTONE N="20"> not complying, than by his &s;u&s;pending it till his Maje&s;ty and his two Hou&s;es &s;hould agree upon a future Government; which, they &s;aid,&endq; much differ'd from an abolition of it.</Q></P>
<P>HEREUPON he gave them his final An&s;wer, <Q>&startq;that after &s;uch con|de&s;cen&s;ions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's fi|nal An&s;wer.</NOTE> and weighed re&s;olutions in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Church, he had expected not to be farther pre&s;s'd therein; it being his judgement,&endq; and his con&s;cience.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he could not, as he was then inform'd, aboli&s;h Epi&s;copacy out of the Church; yet, becau&s;e he apprehended how fatal new di&s;tractions might be to the Kingdom, and that he be|liev'd his two Hou&s;es would yield to truth, if it were made manife&s;t <MILESTONE N="30"> to them, as he had allways declared that he would comply with their Demands, if he were convinced in his Con&s;cience, he did therefore again de&s;ire a con&s;ultation with Divines, in the manner he had before propo&s;ed, and would in the mean time &s;u&s;pend the Epi&s;copal power, as well in point of Ordination of Mini&s;ters, as of Juri&s;diction, till He and the two Hou&s;es &s;hould agree what Government &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the future. For Bi&s;hop's Lands, he could not con&s;ent to the ab|&s;olute alienation of them from the Church, but would con&s;ent that Lea&s;es for Lives, or Years, not exceeding ninety nine, &s;hould be made&endq; for the &s;atisfaction of Purcha&s;ers or Contractors;</Q> little differing from <MILESTONE N="40"> the An&s;wer he had formerly given to this la&s;t particular: and in all the re&s;t he adhered to his former An&s;wers. And the Commi&s;&s;ioners, having receiv'd this his final An&s;wer, took their leaves, and the next morning begun their Journey towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THE King had begun a Letter to the Prince his Son before the fir&s;t forty days were expired, and continued it, as the Treaty was lengthen'd, even to the hour it was concluded, and fini&s;hed it the nine and twentieth of <HI>November</HI> after the Commi&s;&s;ioners were departed, and with it &s;ent a very exact Copy of all the Papers which had pa&s;&s;ed in the Treaty, in the order in which they were pa&s;&s;ed, fairly engro&s;&s;ed by one of the <MILESTONE N="50"> Clerks who attended. But the Letter it &s;elf was all in his own hand, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sum of the King's Letter to hi$ Son concern|ing th$ whole Treaty</NOTE> contained above &s;ix Sheets of Paper; in which he made a very parti|cular relation of all the motives and rea&s;ons which had prevailed with
<PB N="176" REF="1960">
him, or over him, to make tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions; out of which mo&s;t of this relation is extracted. And it is allmo&s;t evident, that the Major part of both Hou&s;es of Parliament was, at that time, &s;o far from de&s;iring the execution of all tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, that, if they had been able to have re&s;i&s;ted the wild fury of the Army, they would have been them&s;elves Suitors to have declined the greate&s;t part of them. That which &s;eem'd to afflict him mo&s;t, next what referr'd to the Church and Religion, and which, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;had a large &s;hare in his con&s;cientious con&s;iderations, was the hard mea&s;ure his Friends were &s;ubjected to;</Q> for who&s;e Intere&s;t he did verily believe he &s;hould better provide in the execution of the <MILESTONE N="10"> Treaty, than he had been able to do in the Preliminaries. <Q>For, he &s;aid, &startq;he could not but think, that all who were willing that he &s;hould con|tinue their King, and to live under his Government, would be far from de&s;iring in the conclu&s;ion to leave &s;o foul a Brand upon his Party, of which they would all de&s;ire to be accounted for the time to come. However, he hoped that all his Friends would con&s;ider, not what he had &s;ubmitted to, but how much he had endeavour'd to relieve them&endq; from;</Q> and conjured the Prince his Son, <Q>&startq;that the le&s;s he had been able him&s;elf to do for them, the more, if God ble&s;&s;ed him, He &s;hould&endq; acknowledge and &s;upply.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he would willingly forget in how <MILESTONE N="20"> high degree &s;ome Subjects had been di&s;loyal, but never had Prince a Te&s;timony in others of more Loyalty than He had had; and however that God, for their, and his puni&s;hment, had not ble&s;&s;ed &s;ome of their Endeavours, yet, he &s;aid, more mi&s;guided Per&s;ons were at la&s;t reduced to their Loyalty, than could in any &s;tory be exampled; and that, by that, Subjects might learn how dangerous the neglect of &s;ea&s;onable duty is; and that Men cannot ea&s;ily fix when they plea&s;e what they&endq; have unnece&s;&s;arily &s;haken.</Q> The conclu&s;ion of the Letter, as it was dated, the five and twentieth of <HI>November</HI> (what was added to it after, till the nine and twentieth, was but the additional pa&s;&s;ages upon the <MILESTONE N="30"> enlargement of time) de&s;erves to be pre&s;erv'd in Letters of Gold, and gives the be&s;t Character of that excellent Prince; and was in the&s;e words.</P>

If You &s;aw how unmanly and unchri|&s;tian the implacable di&s;po&s;ition is in our ill Willers, you would avoid that Spirit. Cen&s;ure Us not for having parted with &s;o much of our own Right; the price was great, but the commodity was &s;ecurity to Us, Peace to our People: and we were confident, another Parliament would remember how u&s;eful a King's power is to a People's liberty; of how much thereof We deve&s;ted Our &s;elf, that We and They might meet once again in a due Parliamentary way, to agree the bounds of Prince and People. And in this give belief to our Experience, never <MILESTONE N="50"> to affect more Greatne&s;s or Prerogative, than that which is really and intrin&s;ically for the Good of Subjects, not the &s;atisfaction of Favou|rites.

The&s;e con&s;iderations may make You as great a Prince, as your Father is now a low one; and Your State may be &s;o much the more e&s;tabli&s;hed, as Mine hath been &s;haken. For our Subjects have learn'd (we dare &s;ay) that Victories over their Princes are but Triumphs over them&s;elves; and &s;o will be more unwilling to hearken to changes hereafter.

<P><Q>&startq;TO conclude, if God gives you &s;ucce&s;s, u&s;e it humbly and far from Revenge. If He re&s;tore you to your Right upon hard conditions, what|ever you promi&s;e, keep.

</LETTER>
<P>WHILST the Treaty la&s;ted, it was believ'd that his Maje&s;ty might have made his e&s;cape; which mo&s;t Men who wi&s;hed him well, thought in all re&s;pects ought to have been attempted; and before the Treaty, he <MILESTONE N="40"> him&s;elf was inclined to it, thinking any Liberty preferable to the re|&s;traint he had endured. But he did receive &s;ome di&s;couragement from pur&s;uing that purpo&s;e, which both diverted him from it, and gave him great trouble of mind. It cannot be imagin'd how wonderfully fearful &s;ome Per&s;ons in <HI>France</HI> were that he &s;hould have made his E&s;cape, and the dread they had of his coming thither; which, without doubt, was not from want of tenderne&s;s of his &s;afety, but from the apprehen&s;ion they had, that the little re&s;pect they would have &s;hewed him there, would have been a greater mortification to him than all that he could <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;uffer by the clo&s;e&s;t impri&s;onment. And &s;ure there was, at that time, no Court in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> &s;o honourably, or generou&s;ly con&s;tituted, that it would have been glad to have &s;een him; and it might be &s;ome rea&s;on
<PB N="178" REF="1980">
that they who wi&s;hed him very well, did not wi&s;h his E&s;cape, becau&s;e they believ'd impri&s;onment was the wor&s;t his wor&s;t Enemies intended towards him; &s;ince they might that way more rea&s;onably found, and &s;ettle their Republican Government; which Men could not &s;o pru|dently propo&s;e to bring to pa&s;s by a Murther; which, in the in&s;tant, gave the ju&s;t Title to another who was at liberty to claim his Right, and to di&s;pute it: I &s;ay, before the Treaty, and after the Votes and De|clarations of no more Addre&s;&s;es, when his Treatment was &s;o barbarous, his Maje&s;ty had propo&s;ed to him&s;elf to make an E&s;cape, and was very near the perfecting it. He had none about him but &s;uch per&s;ons who <MILESTONE N="$$"> were placed by tho&s;e who wi&s;hed wor&s;t to his &s;afety; and therefore cho&s;e &s;uch In&s;truments as they thought to be of their own Principles. Among&s;t tho&s;e there was a young Man, one <HI>Osborne,</HI> by extraction a Gentleman; who was recommended by the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> (one who de&s;erv'd not to be &s;u&s;pected by <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf) to Colonel <HI>Hammond,</HI> to be placed in &s;ome near attendance about the King; and he, from the recommendation, never doubting the fitne&s;s of the Man, immediately appointed him to wait as Gentleman U&s;her; which gave him oppor|tunity to be allmo&s;t allways in the pre&s;ence of the King. This young Man, after &s;ome months attendance, was wrought upon by the dignity <MILESTONE N="$$"> of the King's carriage, and the great Affability he u&s;ed towards tho&s;e who were allways about him, to have a tenderne&s;s and loyal Sen&s;e of his &s;ufferings; and did really de&s;ire to do him any &s;ervice that might be acceptable. By his Office of Gentleman U&s;her he u&s;ually held the King's Gloves when he was at meat, and fir&s;t took that opportunity to put a little Billet, in which he expre&s;s'd his Devotion, into one of the fingers of his Glove. The King was not forward to be credulous of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of a Per&s;on he knew &s;o little, and who, he knew, would not be &s;uffer'd to be about him, if he were thought to have tho&s;e Inclinations. However, after longer ob&s;ervation, and &s;ometimes &s;peaking to him <MILESTONE N="30"> whil&s;t he was walking among&s;t others in the Garden allowed for that purpo&s;e, his Maje&s;ty begun to believe that there was &s;incerity in him; and &s;o frequently put &s;ome Memorial into fingers of his Glove, and by the &s;ame expedient receiv'd adverti&s;ement from him.</P>
<P>THERE was in the Garri&s;on one <HI>Rolph,</HI> a Captain of a Foot Com|pany, whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> placed there as a prime confident, a fellow of a low Extraction, and very ordinary parts; who, from a Common Sol|dier, had been tru&s;ted in all the intriegues of the Army, and was one of the Agitators in&s;pired by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to put any thing into the Soldier's minds, upon whom he had a wonderful Influence, and could not con|tain <MILESTONE N="40"> him&s;elf from &s;peaking maliciou&s;ly and wickedly again&s;t the King, when di&s;&s;imulation was at the highe&s;t among&s;t the great Officers. This Man grew into great familiarity with <HI>Osborne,</HI> and knowing from what Per&s;on he came recommended to that Tru&s;t, could not doubt but that he was well inclined to any thing that might advance him; and &s;o, ac|cording to his cu&s;tom of reviling the King, he wi&s;hed <Q>&startq;he were out of the world; for they &s;hould never make any &s;ettlement whil&s;t He was alive. He &s;aid, he was &s;ure the Army wi&s;h'd him dead, and that <HI>Ham|mond</HI> had receiv'd many Letters from the Army to take him away by Poy&s;on, or any other way; but he &s;aw it would never be done in that <MILESTONE N="50"> place; and therefore, if he would joyn with him, they would get him&endq; from thence; and then the work would ea&s;ily be done.</Q> <HI>Osborne</HI> asked him, <Q>&startq;how it could be po&s;&s;ible to remove him from thence, without&endq;
<PB N="179" REF="1990">
<HI>Hammond</HI>'s, or the King's own con&s;ent?</Q> <HI>Rolph</HI> An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that the King might be decoyed from thence, as he was from <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, by &s;ome Letters from his Friends, of &s;ome danger that threaten'd him, upon which he would be willing to make an E&s;cape; and then he might&endq; ea&s;ily be di&s;patched.</Q> <HI>Osborne</HI> &s;hortly found an opportunity to inform the King of all this.</P>
<P><Q>THE King bid him &startq;continue his familiarity with <HI>Rolph,</HI> and to pro|mi&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attemps for the King's $&s;cape.</NOTE> to joyn with him in contriving how his Maje&s;ty &s;hould make an&endq; E&s;cape;</Q> and he hoped thereby to make <HI>Rolph</HI>'s Villainy the means of getting away. He recommended one of the Common Soldiers to <HI>Osborne,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> <Q>&startq;&endq;who, he &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;&endq;he thought, might be tru&s;ted;</Q> and wi&s;h'd him <Q>&startq;to tru&s;t&endq; one <HI>Doucet;</HI></Q> whom the King had known before, and who was then placed to wait upon him at his back &s;taires, and was indeed an hone&s;t Man; for it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to make an E&s;cape, without the privity of &s;uch Per&s;ons, who might provide for him, when he was got out of the Ca&s;tle, as well as help him from thence. <Q><HI>Osborne</HI> told <HI>Rolph,</HI> &startq;he was confident he &s;hould in the end per&s;wade the King to attempt an E&s;cape, though he yet &s;eem'd jealous and apprehen&s;ive of being di&s;|cover'd,&endq; and taken again.</Q> <HI>Doucet</HI> concurr'd very willingly in it, and the Soldier who was cho&s;en by the King, prov'd likewi&s;e very hone&s;t, <MILESTONE N="20"> and wrought upon one or two of his Companions who u&s;ed to &s;tand Sen|tinels at the place where the King intended to get out. All things were provided; and the King had a File, and Saw; with which he had, with wonderful trouble, &s;awed an Iron Bar in the Window, by which he could be able to get out; and being in this readine&s;s, the night was ap|pointed, and <HI>Osborne</HI> at the place where he was to receive the King. But one of the Soldiers inform'd <HI>Rolph</HI> of more particulars than <HI>Osborne</HI> had done, by which he concluded that he was fal&s;e, and directed the Soldier to proceed, and &s;tand Sentinel in the &s;ame place to which he had been a&s;&s;ign'd; and he, and &s;ome others tru&s;ted by him, were arm'd, and <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;tood very near with their Pi&s;tols. At midnight the King came to the Window, re&s;olving to go out; but as he was putting him&s;elf out, he di&s;cern'd more Per&s;ons to &s;tand thereabout than u&s;ed to do, and there|upon &s;u&s;pected that there was &s;ome di&s;covery made; and &s;o &s;hut the Window, and retired to his bed. And this was all the ground of a di&s;|cour&s;e,. which then flew abroad, as if the King had got half out at the Window, and could neither draw his Body after, nor get his Head back, and &s;o was compelled to call out for help; which was a meer fiction.</P>
<P>ROLPH acquainted <HI>Hammond</HI> with what the King had de&s;ign'd; who pre&s;ently went into his Chamber, and &s;ound the King in his bed, <MILESTONE N="40"> but the Bar of the Window cut in two, and taken out; by which he concluded his information to be true; and pre&s;ently &s;ei&s;ed upon <HI>Doucet,</HI> but could not apprehend <HI>Osborne;</HI> who was either fled out of the I&s;land, or concealed in it that he could not be found. <HI>Rolph</HI> could not forbear to in&s;ult upon <HI>Doucet</HI> in Pri&s;on, and &s;cornfully asked him, <Q>&startq;why his&endq; King came not &s;orth when he was at the Window?</Q> and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he was&endq; ready with a good Pi&s;tol charged to have receiv'd him.</Q> When <HI>Osborne</HI> had got into a place of pre&s;ent &s;afety, he writ a Letter to his Patron the Lord <HI>Wharton,</HI> informing him of the whole matter; and de&s;ired him, <Q>&startq;to acquaint the Hou&s;e of Peers of the de&s;ign upon the King's Life,&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Osborne <HI>a$$ &s;$$</HI> Rolph <HI>for a de&s;ign upon the King's Life</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> and that he would be ready to appear and ju&s;tify the Con&s;piracy.</Q> That Lord, after he had kept the Letter &s;ome time, &s;ent it to <HI>Hammond,</HI> as the fitte&s;t Per&s;on to examine the truth of the Relation. <HI>Osborne</HI> was
<PB N="180" REF="2000">
not di&s;couraged with all this; but &s;ent two Letters to the Speakers o$ both Hou&s;es, and inclo&s;ed the Letter he had formerly writ to the Lor$ <HI>Wharton.</HI> In the Hou&s;e of Commons the information was &s;lighted and laid a&s;ide; but it made more impre&s;&s;ion upon the Hou&s;e of Peers who &s;ent, with more than ordinary earne&s;tne&s;s, to the Commons, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Rolph</HI> might be &s;ent for, and a Safe-guard for forty days to <HI>Osborne&endq;</HI> to appear, and pro&s;ecute.</Q></P>

<P>BUT that which troubled mo&s;t, and indeed which awaken'd them to the mo&s;t di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions, was, that they were adverti&s;ed, that the King was taken away from <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> Ca&s;tle by an Officer of the Ar|my, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King taken from</HI> Carisbrooke <HI>Ca&s;tle and carried to</HI> Hur&s;t <HI>Ca&s;tle.</HI></NOTE> and carried to <HI>Hur&s;t</HI> Ca&s;tle, not far from the other, but Situated <MILESTONE N="$$"> on the main Land, and in &s;o vile and unwhole&s;ome an Air, that the Common Guards there u&s;ed to be frequently changed for the pre&s;erva|tion of their health.

<P>THIS News being brought when they were in the heat of the Debate upon the King's An&s;wer, they gave over that conte&s;t, and immediately Voted, <Q>&startq;that the &s;ei&s;ing upon the King's Per&s;on, and carrying him Pri|&s;oner&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vote of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons there|upon.</NOTE> to <HI>Hur&s;t</HI> Ca&s;tle,</Q> was without Their advice and con&s;ent: which Vote had little contradiction, becau&s;e no Man would own the Advice.

<P>THEY who vehemently pre&s;&s;ed this Conclu&s;ion, and would be thought to be for the King, to make them&s;elves popular, took upon them to make all the Invectives both again&s;t the King, and all the time of his Government, that his bittere&s;t Enemies could do, only that they might &s;hew how much the conce&s;&s;ions he had now granted, had provided Re|medies for all tho&s;e Evils, and made all the foundation of their future hope of happine&s;s and peace, to be in the no-power they had left him in: &s;o that if he &s;hould have a mind to continue the Di&s;tractions to mor|row, he would find no Body ready ever to joyn with him, having at <MILESTONE N="20"> this time &s;acrificed all his Friends to the Mercy of their mortal Ene|mies.

And here they were kept in one room, till after twelve of the Clock in the Night: after which hour, in re&s;pect of the extreme cold Weather, and the Age of many of the Mem|bers, they were carried to &s;everal Inns; where they were &s;uffer'd to lodge as Pri&s;oners, and remain'd under that confinement for two or three days.

No body own'd this <MILESTONE N="20"> Act of Violence in the Exclu&s;ion of &s;o many Members: there was no Order made for it by the Hou&s;e. <HI>Fairfax</HI> the General knew nothing of it, and the Guards them&s;elves being asked <Q>&startq;&endq;what Authority they had, gave no other An&s;wer,</Q> <Q>&startq;&endq;but that they had Orders.</Q> But afterwards there <NOTE PLACE="marg"><Q>Vote, &startq;that tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent at the Ne|gative Vote &s;hould &s;it no more in the&endq; Hou&s;e.</Q></NOTE> was a full and clear Order of the Hou&s;e, without taking notice of any exclu&s;ion, <Q>&startq;that none of them who had not been pre&s;ent that day when the Negative Vote prevailed, &s;hould &s;it any more in the Hou&s;e, be|fore they had fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed the &s;ame Vote, as agreeable to their judge|ments; which if they &s;ub&s;cribed, they were as well qualified Mem|bers&endq; as before.</Q> Many of the&s;e excluded Members, out of Con&s;cience <MILESTONE N="30"> or Indignation, forbore coming any more to the Hou&s;e for many years; &s;ome, not before the Revolution; others, &s;ooner or later, return'd to their old Seates, that they might not be idle when &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s was to be done.</P>

<P>HOW new and mon&s;trous &s;oever this language and di&s;cour&s;e was to all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ears, they found a Major part &s;till to concur with them:
<PB N="186" REF="2060">
&s;o that they appointed a Committee for the pre&s;ent <Q>&startq;to prepare a charge <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee appointed by them to pre+pare a Charge again&s;t the King.</NOTE> of High Trea&s;on again&s;t the King, which &s;hould contain the &s;everal Crimes, and Mi&s;demeanours of his Reign; which being made, they would con&s;ider of the be&s;t way and manner of Proceeding, that he&endq; might be brought to Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>THIS manner of proceeding in <HI>England</HI> was &s;o unheard of, that it was very hard for any Body to propo&s;e any way to oppo&s;e it that might carry with it any hope of &s;ucce&s;s. However, the pain the Prince was in, would not &s;uffer him to re&s;t without making &s;ome effort. He knew too well how far the States of <HI>Holland</HI> were from wi&s;hing that &s;ucce&s;s, and honour to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as it had de&s;erv'd from them, and how much they had allways favour'd the Rebellion; that his own pre|&s;ence was in no degree acceptable or grateful to them; and that they were devi&s;ing allways how they might be rid of him: yet he believ'd the way they were now upon in <HI>England,</HI> would be &s;o univer&s;ally odious to all Chri&s;tians, that no Body of Men would appear to favour it. His Highne&s;s therefore &s;ent to the States General, to de&s;ire them <Q>&startq;to give <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>de&s;ires the States to intercede with the two Hou&s;es.</HI></NOTE> him an Audience the next day; and that he would come to the place&endq; where they &s;ate;</Q> which he did, being met by the whole Body at the bottom of the Stairs, and conducted into the Room where they &s;ate. <MILESTONE N="$$"></P>
<P>THE Prince was attended by four or five of his Council; and when he had &s;aid a little to the States of Complement, he referr'd them to a paper which S^r <HI>William Bo&s;well,</HI> the King's Re&s;ident there, was to de|liver to them. The paper de&s;cribed the ill condition the King his Father was in; and the threats and menaces which his Enemies u&s;ed to pro|ceed again&s;t him in &s;uch a manner as mu&s;t be abominated by all Chri|&s;tians, and which would bring the greate&s;t reproach and obloquy upon the Prote&s;tant Religion, that ever Chri&s;tianity had undergone: And therefore de&s;ired them, <Q>&startq;that they would interpo&s;e their credit, and authority, in &s;uch a manner as they thought fit, with the two Hou&s;es <MILESTONE N="30"> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> that, in&s;tead of &s;uch an unlawful and wicked pro&s;e|cution, they would enter into Terms of accommodation with his Royal Father; for the ob&s;ervation whereof his Royal Highne&s;s would be|come&endq; bound.</Q></P>
<P>THE States a&s;&s;ured his Highne&s;s, <Q>&startq;that they were very much af|flicted <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their An&s;wer.</NOTE> at the condition of the King, and would be glad any interpo|&s;ition of Theirs might be able to relieve him; that they would &s;eriou&s;ly&endq; con&s;ider in what manner they might &s;erve him.</Q> And, that day, they re&s;olv'd to &s;end an extraordinary Emba&s;&s;adour into <HI>England,</HI> who &s;hould repair to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and receive his In&s;tructions to what Friends <MILESTONE N="40"> of the King's he &s;hould re&s;ort, and con&s;ult with; who, being upon the place, might be&s;t inform him to whom to apply him&s;elf. And they made choice of <HI>Paw,</HI> the Pen&s;ioner of <HI>Holland,</HI> for their Emba&s;&s;adour; who immediately attended the Prince with the Offer of his Service, and many profe&s;&s;ions of his de&s;ire that his Journey might produce &s;ome good Effect.</P>
<P>THE Council that was about the Prince, had looked upon <HI>Paw</HI> as a Man that had allways favour'd the Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> and as much ob&s;tructed all Civilities from the States towards the King, as was po&s;&s;i|ble for him to do; and therefore they were very &s;orry that He was made <MILESTONE N="50"> choice of for Emba&s;&s;adour in &s;uch a fatal conjuncture. But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> a&s;&s;ured the Prince, <Q>&startq;that he had u&s;ed all his credit to com|pa&s;s that Election; that he was the Wi&s;e&s;t Man of their Body; and
<PB N="187" REF="2070">
that neither He, nor any of the re&s;t, who had cheri&s;hed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rebellion more than he, ever de&s;ired it &s;hould pro&s;per to that degree it had done, as to endanger the changing the Government; and there|fore&endq; wi&s;hed</Q> <Q>&startq;there might not appear any di&s;tru&s;t of him, but that the Prince would treat him with confidence, and &s;ome of the Coun|cil would confer with him with freedom, upon any particulars which&endq; it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to be in&s;tructed in.</Q> But the wi&s;dom of Angels was not &s;ufficient to give any effectual advice for &s;uch a Nego|tiation, &s;ince the States could not be brought &s;o much to intere&s;t them|&s;elves, as to u&s;e any Menaces to the Parliament as if they would em|bark <MILESTONE N="10"> them&s;elves in the quarrel. <Q>So that the Council could only wi&s;h, &startq;that the Emba&s;&s;adour would confer with &s;uch of the King's Friends who were then at <HI>London,</HI> and who&s;e relation had been mo&s;t eminent towards his Maje&s;ty; and receive advice from them, how he might mo&s;t hopefully prevail over particular Men, and thereby with the&endq; Parliament.</Q> And &s;o the Emba&s;&s;adour departed for <HI>England,</HI> within <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They &s;end an Emba&s;&s;adour into</HI> England.</NOTE> le&s;s than a week after he was nominated for the Employment.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> being &s;truck to the heart with amazement and confu&s;ion upon the report of what the Parliament intended, &s;ent a Paper to the Agent who was employed there by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen &s;ent a Paper to be deliver'd to the Parlia|ment, but it was laid a&s;ide.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> Cardinal to keep a good corre&s;pondence; which &s;he obliged him to de|liver to the Parliament. The Paper contain'd a very pa&s;&s;ionate lamen|tation of the &s;ad condition the King her Husband was in; de&s;iring <Q>&startq;that they would grant her a Pa&s;s to come over to him, offering to u&s;e all the credit &s;he had with him, that he might give them &s;atisfaction. However, if they would not give her leave to perform any of tho&s;e Offices towards the Publick, that &s;he might be permitted to perform the Duty &s;he owed Him, and to be near him in the uttermo&s;t Extre|mity.&endq;</Q> Neither of the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es did more than expre&s;s the Zeal of tho&s;e who procured them to be made: the Emba&s;&s;adour <HI>Paw</HI> could nei|ther <MILESTONE N="30"> get leave to &s;ee the King (which he was to endeavour to do, that he might from him&s;elf be in&s;tructed be&s;t what to do) nor be admitted to an Audience by the Parliament, till after the Tragedy was acted: and the Queen's Paper was deliver'd, and never con&s;ider'd in order to return any An&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>WHEN the Committee had prepared &s;uch a Charge, which they <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Charge again&s;t the King approv'd by the Com|mons&punc;</NOTE> called <Q>&startq;an Impeachment of High Trea&s;on again&s;t <HI>Charles Stewart</HI> King&endq; of <HI>England,</HI></Q> dige&s;ted into &s;everal Articles, which contain'd all tho&s;e Calumnies they had formerly heaped up in that Declaration of no more Addre&s;&s;es to be made to him, with &s;ome Additional Reproaches, it was <MILESTONE N="40"> read in the Hou&s;e; and, after it was approv'd there, they &s;ent it to the Hou&s;e of Peers for Their concurrence. That Hou&s;e had very little to do from the time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> return'd from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and were few in Number, and u&s;ed to Adjourn for two or three days together for want of bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that it was believ'd, that they who had done &s;o many extravagant things, rather than they would di&s;&s;ent from the Hou&s;e of Commons, would likewi&s;e concur with them in This, rather than &s;ever from them when they were &s;o triumphant. But, contrary to this expectation, when this Impeachment was brought up to the Peers, it was &s;o ill receiv'd, that there was not one Per&s;on who concurr'd <MILESTONE N="50"> with them; which, con&s;idering the Men and what mo&s;t of them had done, might &s;eem very &s;trange. And when they had, with &s;ome warmth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejected by the Lords; who adjourn'd for a week.</NOTE> rejected it, they Adjourn'd for a week; pre&s;uming they &s;hould thereby
<PB N="188" REF="2080">
at lea&s;t give &s;ome interruption to that Career which the Hou&s;e of Com|mons was upon, and, in that time, &s;ome expedient might be found to reconcile the Proceedings in both Hou&s;es. But they were as much de|ceiv'd in this; the Hou&s;e of Commons was very well plea&s;ed with it, and thought they had given them ea&s;e, which they could not &s;o well have contriv'd for them&s;elves. So they proceeded in their own Method, and when the day came to which the Lords had Adjourn'd their Hou&s;e, they found their doors all locked, and fa&s;ten'd with Padlocks, that there <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Door of their Hou&s;e locked up a|gain&s;t the day to which they had adjourn'd</NOTE> &s;hould then be no more Entrance for them; nor did any of them ever after &s;it in that Hou&s;e as Peers above twice or thrice at mo&s;t, till <HI>Crom|well,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> long after, endeavour'd in vain to have erected a Hou&s;e of Peers of his own Creation; in which &s;ome of them then very willingly took their places.</P>
<P>THE Charge and Accu&s;ation, upon which they re&s;olv'd to proceed again&s;t the King, being thus &s;ettled and agreed upon, they begun to con&s;ider in what manner and form to proceed, that there might be &s;ome appearance of Ju&s;tice. Nothing could be found in the Common or Sta|tute-Law, which could direct or warrant them; nor could the Pre|cedent of depo&s;ing <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd (the &s;ole Precedent of that kind) be applied to their purpo&s;e: for, how foul &s;oever the circum&s;tances pre|cedent <MILESTONE N="20"> had been, he had made a Re&s;ignation of his Royalty before the Lords in Parliament; &s;o that his Depo&s;ition proceeded from Him&s;elf, and with his own Con&s;ent, and would not agree in any particular with the ca&s;e in que&s;tion. They were therefore to make a new form to war|rant their Proceedings: and a new form they did erect, never before heard of. They con&s;tituted and erected a Court that &s;hould be called <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons con&s;titute a High Court of Ju&s;tice.</NOTE> <Q><HI>&startq;the High Court of Ju&s;tice,</HI> to con&s;i&s;t of &s;o many Judges, who &s;hould have Authority to try the King, whether he were guilty of what he was accu&s;ed of, or no; and, in order thereunto, to examine &s;uch Wit|ne&s;&s;es&endq; as &s;hould be produced: the Number of the Judges named was <MILESTONE N="30"> about an hundred and fifty, whereof the Major part might proceed.</Q></P>
<P>THEY could not have found &s;uch a number yet among&s;t them&s;elves, after &s;o many barbarities and impieties, upon whom they might depend in this la&s;t Tragical Act. And therefore they laid this for a ground; that if they &s;hould make only their own Members to be Judges in this ca&s;e, they might appear in the Eyes of the People to be too much par|ties, as having from the beginning maintain'd a War, though defen&s;ive, as they pretended, again&s;t the King, and &s;o not &s;o fit to be the only Judges who were in the fault: on the other hand, if they &s;hould name none of them&s;elves, it might be interpreted that they looked upon it <MILESTONE N="40"> as too dangerous a Province to engage them&s;elves in, and therefore they had put it off to others; which would di&s;courage others from under|taking it. Wherefore they re&s;olv'd, that the Judges &s;hould be nomi|nated promi&s;cuou&s;ly, as well of Members of the Hou&s;e, as of &s;uch other of their good and Godly Men in the Kingdom. Who&s;oever would not be one him&s;elf when named, as there were yet many among&s;t them, who, out of Con&s;cience, or of Fear, utterly prote&s;ted again&s;t it, &s;hould take upon him to name another Man; which &s;ure he could not but think was equally unlawful: So that few took upon them to nominate others, who would reject the Province them&s;elves. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>ALL the Chief Officers of the Army were named, and divers accepted the Office; and &s;uch Aldermen and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> as had been mo&s;t violent again&s;t Peace, and &s;ome few Country Gentlemen, who&s;e

Zeal had been taken notice of for the Cau&s;e, and who were like to take &s;uch a Preferment as a te&s;timony of the Parliament's confidence in them, and would thereupon embrace it. When &s;uch a Number of Men were nominated as were thought in all re&s;pects to be equal to the work, they were to make choice of a Speaker, or Prolocutor, who &s;hould be called <HI>Lord Pre&s;ident</HI> of that High Court, who mu&s;t manage and govern all the proceedings there, ask the Witne&s;&s;es all proper Que&s;tions, and an|&s;wer what the Pri&s;oner &s;hould propo&s;e. And to that Office one <HI>Brad|&s;haw</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brad&s;haw <HI>made Lord Pre&s;ident.</HI></NOTE> was cho&s;en, a Lawyer of <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> not much known in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-</HI>Hall, though of good practice in his Chamber, and much em|ployed <MILESTONE N="10"> by the Factious. He was a Gentleman of an ancient Family in <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> but of a Fortune of his own making. He was not without parts, and of great in&s;olence and ambition. When he was fir&s;t nominated, he &s;eem'd much &s;urpri&s;ed, and very re&s;olute to refu&s;e it; which he did in &s;uch a manner, and &s;o much enlarging upon his own want of abilities to undergo &s;o important a Charge, that it was very evident he had expected to be put to that Apology. <Q>And when he was pre&s;s'd with more importunity than could have been u&s;ed by chance, he required &startq;&endq;time to con&s;ider of it;</Q> <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he would then give his&endq; final An&s;wer; which he did, the next day;</Q> and with great Humility <MILESTONE N="20"> accepted the Office, which he admini&s;ter'd with all the pride, impudence, and &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s imaginable. He was pre&s;ently inve&s;ted in great State, and many Officers, and a Guard a&s;&s;ign'd for the &s;ecurity of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawyers and other Officers appointed.</NOTE> Per&s;on, and the Dean's Hou&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> given to him for ever for his re&s;idence and habitation, and a good Sum of Money, about five thou&s;and pounds, was appointed to be pre&s;ently paid to him, to put him&s;elf in &s;uch an Equipage and way of living, as the dignity of the Office which he held would require. And now, the Lord Pre&s;ident of the High Court of Ju&s;tice, &s;eem'd to be the greate&s;t Magi&s;trate in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> <Q>And though it was not thought &s;ea&s;onable to make any &s;uch De|claration, <MILESTONE N="30"> yet &s;ome of tho&s;e who&s;e opinions grew quickly into Ordi|nances, upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, declared, &startq;that they believ'd that Of|fice was not to be looked upon as nece&s;&s;ary <HI>pro hac vice</HI> only, but for continuance; and that he who executed it, de&s;erv'd to have an ample&endq; and a liberal E&s;tate conferr'd upon him for ever: which &s;uddain mu|tation and exaltation of fortune, could not but make a great impre&s;&s;ion upon a vulgar &s;pirit, accu&s;tom'd to no Exce&s;&s;es, and acquainted only with a very moderate fortune.</Q> All this being done, they made choice of &s;ome Lawyers (till that time very ob&s;cure, and Men &s;carce known or heard of in their profe&s;&s;ion) to perform the Offices of Atturney Ge|neral, <MILESTONE N="40"> and Sollicitor General for the State, to pro&s;ecute the Pri&s;oner at his Trial, and to manage the Evidence again&s;t him. Other Officers, of all kinds, were appointed to attend, and perform the &s;everal Offices of their new Court; which was ordered to be erected in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Hall.</P>
<P>THE King was now &s;ent for from <HI>Hur&s;t</HI> Ca&s;tle, and was receiv'd by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King &s;ent for from</HI> Hur&s;t <HI>Ca&s;tle by</HI> Har|ri&s;on.</NOTE> Colonel <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> with a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e; by whom he was to be conducted to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> was the Son of a Butcher near <HI>Nantwich</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and had been bred up in the place of a Clerk un|der <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Character of</HI> Harri&s;on.</NOTE> a Lawyer of good Account in tho&s;e parts; which kind of Educa|tion <MILESTONE N="50"> introduces Men into the language and practice of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and, if it be not re&s;i&s;ted by the great ingenuity of the Per&s;on, inclines young Men to more pride than any other kind of breeding; and di&s;po&s;es them

to be pragmatical and in&s;olent, though they have the Skill to conceal it from their Ma&s;ters, except they find them (as they are too often) inclined to cheri&s;h it. When the Rebellion fir&s;t began, this Man quitted his Ma&s;ter (who had relation to the King's Service, and di&s;charged his Duty faithfully) and put him&s;elf into the Parliament Army, where, having fir&s;t obtain'd the Office of a Cornet, he got up, by diligence and &s;obriety, to the State of a Captain, without any &s;ignal notice taken of him till the new model of the Army; when <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who, po&s;&s;i|bly, had knowledge of him before, found him of a &s;pirit and di&s;po&s;ition fit for his Service, much given to Prayer and to Preaching, and, other|wi&s;e, <MILESTONE N="10"> of an under&s;tanding capable to be tru&s;ted in any bu&s;ine&s;s; to which his Clerk&s;hip contributed very much: and then he was preferr'd very fa&s;t; &s;o that, by the time the King was brought to the Army, he had been a Colonel of Hor&s;e, and looked upon as inferior to few, after <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> in the Council of Officers, and in the Govern|ment of the Agitators; and there were few Men with whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> more communicated, or upon whom he more depended for the con|duct of any thing committed to him. He receiv'd the King with out|ward re&s;pect, kept him&s;elf bare; but attended him with great &s;trictne&s;s; and was not to be approached by any Addre&s;s; an&s;wering que&s;tions in <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;hort and few words, and when importuned, with rudene&s;s. He mani|fe&s;ted an apprehen&s;ion that the King had &s;ome thought of making an E&s;cape, and did all things in order to prevent it. Being to lodge at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and &s;o to pa&s;s by <HI>Bag&s;hot,</HI> the King expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee his little Park at <HI>Bag&s;hot,</HI> and &s;o to dine at the Lodge there, a place where he had u&s;ed to take much plea&s;ure; and did not di&s;&s;emble the knowing that the Lord <HI>Newburgh,</HI> who had lately Married the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> liv'd there; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he would &s;end a Servant to let that Lady know that he would dine with her, that &s;he might provide a&endq; dinner for him.</Q> <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> well knew the Affection of that Lord and <MILESTONE N="30"> Lady, and was very unwilling he &s;hould make any &s;tay there; but find|ing the King &s;o fixt upon it, that he would not be otherwi&s;e removed from it than by ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing him to go thither, he cho&s;e to con|&s;ent, and that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;end a Servant; which he did the night before he intended to dine there.</P>
<P>BOTH Lord and Lady were of known Duty and Affection to the King; the Lady, after her Husband the Lord <HI>Aubigney</HI> had been kill'd at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> having &s;o far incen&s;ed the Parliament, that &s;he had endured a long impri&s;onment, under a &s;u&s;picion that &s;he had been privy to the de&s;ign which had been di&s;cover'd by M^r <HI>Waller,</HI> upon which <HI>Tomkins</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> and <HI>Challoner</HI> had been put to death, and had likewi&s;e her &s;elf been put to death, if &s;he had not made her E&s;cape to <HI>Oxford.</HI> After the War was ended, &s;he had, with the King's approbation, married the Lord <HI>Newburgh;</HI> who had the &s;ame Affections.

<P>BEFORE the King came thither, <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> had &s;ent &s;ome Hor&s;e with an Officer to &s;earch the Hou&s;e, and all about the Park, that he might be &s;ure that no Company lurked, which might make &s;ome attempt. And the King, all the morning, found fault with the going of his Hor&s;e; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;he would change it, and procure a better.</Q> When his Ma|je&s;ty <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King dines at the Lord</HI> Newburgh<HI>'s; where was a$ intention of making the King's E&s;cape, but in vain.</HI></NOTE> came to the Lodge, he found his dinner ready, but was quickly in|form'd, <MILESTONE N="20"> <Q>&startq;that the Hor&s;e, &s;o much depended upon, was, the day before, by the blow of another Hor&s;e, &s;o lamed, that he could not be of u&s;e to&endq; the purpo&s;e he was de&s;ign'd for.</Q> And though that Lord had other good Hor&s;es, which in &s;uch an exigent might be made u&s;e of, yet the King had ob&s;erv'd &s;o great difficulty to be in the attempt all his Journey, when he was encompa&s;s'd allways in the middle of a hundred Hor&s;e, the Officers all exceedingly well Hor&s;ed, and every Man, Officer, and Sol|dier, having a Pi&s;tol ready &s;pann'd in one hand, that he re&s;olv'd not to pur&s;ue that de&s;ign. And <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> had already told him, <Q>&startq;that he had&endq; provided a better Hor&s;e for him: and it was believ'd he would never <MILESTONE N="30"> have permitted him to have made u&s;e of one of the Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI>'s.</Q> So that after having &s;pent three or four hours there, with very much &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf, though he was not &s;uffer'd to be in any Room without the Company of &s;ix or &s;even Soldiers, who &s;uffer'd little to be &s;poken, except it was &s;o loud that&punc; They could hear it too, he took a &s;ad farewel of them, appearing to have little hope ever to &s;ee them again. The Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI> rode &s;ome Miles in the Forre&s;t to wait upon the King, till he was required by <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> to return.

IT hath been acknowledged &s;ince by &s;ome Officers, and others who <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;everal Con&s;ultations, before and af|ter this time, among the Of|ficers, what to do with the King:</NOTE> were pre&s;ent at the con&s;ultations, that from the time of the King's be|ing at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and after the Army had ma&s;ter'd both the Par|liament and the City, and were weary of having the King with them, and knew not well how to be rid of him, there were many &s;ecret con|&s;ults what to do with him.

<P>MANY of the Officers were of the fir&s;t opinion, <Q>&startq;as a thing they had Precedents for; and that he being once depo&s;ed, they could better &s;ettle the Government than if he were dead; for his Son could pretend no Right, whil&s;t He was alive; whereas, if the Father were dead, he would pre&s;ently call him&s;elf King, and others would call him &s;o too; and, it may be, other Kings and Princes would own him for &s;uch.

<P>THERE were as many Officers of the &s;econd Judgement, <Q>&startq;that he&endq; &s;hould be pre&s;ently di&s;patch'd.</Q> <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;it appear'd by the expe|rience they had, that whil&s;t He was alive (for a more &s;trict impri&s;on|ment than he had undergone, he could never be confined to) there would be allways Plots and De&s;igns to &s;et him at liberty; and he would have Parties throughout the Kingdom; and, in a &s;hort time, a Faction in their mo&s;t &s;ecret Councils, and it may be in the Army it &s;elf; and, where his liberty would yield &s;o great a price, it would be too great a Tru&s;t to repo&s;e in any Man, that he would long re&s;i&s;t the temptation. <MILESTONE N="40"> Whereas, if he were confe&s;&s;edly dead, all tho&s;e fears would be over; e&s;pecially if they proceeded with that circum&s;pection and &s;everity to|wards&endq; all his Party, as in prudence they ought to do.</Q> This Party might probably have carried it, if <HI>Hammond</HI> could have been wrought upon to have concurr'd; but he had yet too much Con&s;cience to expo&s;e him|&s;elf to that infamy; and without His privity or connivance it could not be done.</P>
<P>THE third Party, which were all the Levellers and Agitators of the Army, in the head of which <HI>Ireton</HI> and <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> were, would not en|dure either of the other ways; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;they could as ea&s;ily bring <MILESTONE N="$$"> him to Ju&s;tice in the &s;ight of the Sun, as Depo&s;e him; &s;ince the Au|thority of the Parliament could do one as well as the other: That their Precedent of Depo&s;ing, had no reputation with the People; but was

<P>BUT it will not be unnece&s;&s;ary to add a &s;hort Character of his Per|&s;on, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character</NOTE> that Po&s;terity may know the ine&s;timable lo&s;s which the Nation then underwent, in being depriv'd of a Prince who&s;e example would have had a greater influence upon the manners, and piety of the Na|tion, than the mo&s;t &s;trict Laws can have. To &s;peak fir&s;t of his private <MILESTONE N="30"> Qualifications as a Man, before the mention of his Princely and Royal Virtues; He was, if ever any, the mo&s;t worthy of the title of an Ho|ne&s;t Man; &s;o great a lover of Ju&s;tice, that no temptation could di&s;po&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Ju&s;tice and Me$$</NOTE> him to a wrongful Action, except it was &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed to him that he believ'd it to be ju&s;t. He had a tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion of Nature, which re&s;train'd him from ever doing a hard-hearted thing: and there|fore he was &s;o apt to grant pardon to Malefactors, that the Judges of the Land repre&s;ented to him the damage and in&s;ecurity to the Publick, that flowed from &s;uch his Indulgence. And then he re&s;train'd him&s;elf from pardoning either Murthers, or High-way Robberies, and quick|ly <MILESTONE N="40"> di&s;cern'd the fruits of his &s;everity by a wonderful Reformation of tho&s;e Enormities. He was very punctual and regular in his Devotions; <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Devotion and Religion</NOTE> he was never known to enter upon his Recreations or Sports, though never &s;o early in the Morning, before he had been at Publick Prayers; &s;o that on hunting days his Chaplains were bound to a very early At|tendance. He was likewi&s;e very &s;trict in ob&s;erving the hours of his private Cabinet Devotions; and was &s;o &s;evere an exactor of gravity and reverence in all mention of Religion, that he could never endure any light or prophane word, with what &s;harpne&s;s of Wit &s;oever it was cover'd: and though he was well plea&s;ed, and delighted with reading <MILESTONE N="50"> Ver&s;es made upon any occa&s;ion, no Man dur&s;t bring before him any thing that was prophane or unclean. That kind of Wit had never any

Countenance then. He was &s;o great an Example of Conjugal Af|fection, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Conjugal Cha&s;tity.</NOTE> that they who did not imitate him in that particular, dur&s;t not brag of their Liberty: and he did not only permit, but direct his Bi&s;hops, to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e &s;candalous Vices, in the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Courts, again&s;t Per&s;ons of eminence, and near Relation to his Service.</P>
<P>HIS Kingly Virtues had &s;ome mixture and allay, that hindred them from &s;hining in full Lu&s;tre, and from producing tho&s;e fruits they &s;hould have been attended with. He was not in his Nature very bountiful, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was not very bounti|ful.</NOTE> though he gave very much. This appear'd more after the Duke of <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s death, after which tho&s;e &s;howres fell very rarely; and he pau&s;ed too long in giving, which made tho&s;e to whom he gave, le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the benefit. He kept State to the full, which made his Court <NOTE PLACE="marg">He kept State in his Court.</NOTE> very orderly; no Man pre&s;uming to be &s;een in a place where he had no pretence to be. He &s;aw, and ob&s;erv'd Men long, before he receiv'd them about his Per&s;on; and did not love &s;trangers, nor very confident Men. He was a patient hearer of Cau&s;es; which he frequently accu|&s;tom'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Patient in hearing Cau&s;es</NOTE> him&s;elf to at the Council-Board; and judged very well, and was dextrous in the mediating part: &s;o that he often put an end to Cau&s;es by per&s;wa&s;ion, which the &s;tubborne&s;s of Men's humours made dilatory <MILESTONE N="20"> in Courts of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>HE was very fearle&s;s in his Per&s;on; but, in his riper years, not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fearle&s;s, not Enterpri&s;ing.</NOTE> very Enterpri&s;ing. He had an excellent under&s;tanding, but was not confident enough of it; which made him often times change his own <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not confident in his own judgement.</NOTE> opinion for a wor&s;e, and follow the advice of Men that did not judge &s;o well as Him&s;elf. This made him more irre&s;olute than the conjun|cture of his Affairs would admit: if he had been of a rougher and more imperious Nature, he would have found more re&s;pect and duty. And his not applying &s;ome &s;evere cures to approaching Evils, proceeded from the Lenity of his Nature, and the tenderne&s;s of his Con&s;cience <MILESTONE N="30"> which, in all ca&s;es of blood, made him choo&s;e the &s;ofter way, and not hearken to &s;evere coun&s;els, how rea&s;onably &s;oever urged. This only re&s;train'd him from pur&s;uing his advantage in the fir&s;t <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Expedi|tion, when, humanly &s;peaking, he might have reduced that Nation to the mo&s;t entire obedience that could have been wi&s;hed. But no Man can &s;ay he had then many who advi&s;ed him to it, but the contrary, by a wonderful indi&s;po&s;ition all his Council had to the War, or any other fatigue. He was allways a great Lover of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lover of the</HI> Scoti&s;h <HI>Na|tion.</HI></NOTE> having not only been born there, but educated by that People, and be|&s;ieged by them allways, having few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> about him till he was King; <MILESTONE N="$0"> and the major number of his Servants being &s;till of that Nation, who he thought could never fail him. And among the&s;e, no Man had &s;uch an A&s;cendent over him, by the humble&s;t in&s;inuations, as Duke <HI>Ha|milton</HI> had.</P>
<P>As he excelled in all other Virtues, &s;o in temperance he was &s;o &s;trict, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abhorr'd De|bauchery.</NOTE> that he abhorr'd all Debauchery to that degree, that, at a great fe&s;ti|val &s;olemnity, where he once was, when very many of the Nobility of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> were entertain'd, being told by one who with|drew from thence, what va&s;t draughts of Wine they drank, and <Q>&startq;that there was one Earl, who had drank mo&s;t of the re&s;t down, and was&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> not him&s;elf moved or alter'd,</Q> the King &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that he de&s;erv'd to be&endq; hanged;</Q> and that Earl coming &s;hortly after into the room where his
<PB N="199" REF="2190">
Maje&s;ty was, in &s;ome gayety, to &s;hew how unhurt he was from that Battle, the King &s;ent one to bid him withdraw from his Maje&s;ties pre|&s;ence; nor did he in &s;ome days after appear before him.</P>
<P>So many miraculous circum&s;tances contributed to his Ruine, that Men might well think that Heaven and Earth con&s;pired it. Though he was, from the fir&s;t declen&s;ion of his power, &s;o much betrayed by his own Servants, that there were very few who remain'd faithful to him, yet that treachery proceeded not allways from any trea&s;onable pur|po&s;e to do Him any harm, but from particular, and per&s;onal Animo|&s;ities again&s;t other Men. And, afterwards, the terror all Men were un|der <MILESTONE N="10"> of the Parliament, and the guilt they were con&s;cious of them&s;elves, made them watch all opportunities to make them&s;elves gracious to tho&s;e who could do them good; and &s;o they became Spies upon their Ma|&s;ter, and from one piece of knavery were harden'd and confirm'd to undertake another; till at la&s;t they had no hope of pre&s;ervation but by the De&s;truction of their Ma&s;ter. And after all this, when a Man might rea&s;onably believe that le&s;s than a univer&s;al Defection of three Nations, could not have reduced a great King to &s;o ugly a fate, it is mo&s;t cer|tain, that, in that very hour when he was thus wickedly murther'd in the &s;ight of the Sun, he had as great a &s;hare in the Hearts and Af|fections <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Belov'd by his Subjects in ge|neral when he was Mur|ther'd</NOTE> of his Subjects in general, was as much belov'd, e&s;teem'd, and longed for by the People in general of the three Nations, as any of his Predece&s;&s;ors had ever been. To conclude, He was the worthie&s;t Gen|tleman, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sum of his Character.</NOTE> the be&s;t Ma&s;ter, the be&s;t Friend, the be&s;t Husband, the be&s;t Father, and the be&s;t Chri&s;tian, that the Age in which he liv'd produced. And if he were not the greate&s;t King, if he were without &s;ome parts and qualities which have made &s;ome Kings great, and happy, no other Prince was ever unhappy who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of half his Virtues and En|dowments, and &s;o much without any kind of Vice.</P>
<P>THIS unparallel'd Murther and Parricide was committed upon the <MILESTONE N="30"> thirtieth of <HI>January,</HI> in the year, according to the Account u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> 1648, in the forty and ninth year of his Age, and when he had &s;uch excellent health, and &s;o great Vigour of Body, that when his Murtherers cau&s;ed him to be open'd (which they did; and were &s;ome of them pre&s;ent at it with great curio&s;ity) they confe&s;&s;ed, and declared, <Q>&startq;that no Man had ever all his vital parts &s;o perfect and unhurt; and that he &s;eem'd to be of &s;o admirable a compo&s;ition and con&s;titution,&endq; that he would probably have liv'd as long as nature could &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</Q> His Body was immediately carried into a room at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> where <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Funeral.</NOTE> he was expo&s;ed for many days to the publick view, that all Men might <MILESTONE N="40"> know that he was not alive. And he was then imbalm'd, and put in|to a Coffin, and &s;o carried to S^t <HI>James</HI>'s; where he likewi&s;e remain'd &s;everal days. <Q>They who were qualified to order his Funeral, declar'd, &startq;that he &s;hould be buried at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> in a decent manner, provided&endq; that the whole Expence &s;hould not exceed five hundred pounds.</Q> The Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Southam|pton</HI> and <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> who had been of his Bed-Chamber, and allways very faithful to him, de&s;ired tho&s;e who govern'd, <Q>&startq;that they might have leave to perform the la&s;t duty to their dead Ma&s;ter, and to wait upon&endq; him to his Grave;</Q> which, after &s;ome pau&s;es, they were permitted to <MILESTONE N="50"> do, with this, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould not attend the Corps out of the Town; &s;ince they re&s;olv'd it &s;hould be privately carried to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> without
<PB N="200" REF="2200">
Pomp or noi&s;e, and then they &s;hould have timely notice, that, if they&endq; plea&s;ed, they might be at his Interment.</Q> And accordingly it was committed to four of tho&s;e Servants, who had been by them appointed to wait upon him during his Impri&s;onment, that they &s;hould convey the Body to <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> which they did. And it was, that Night, placed in that Chamber which had u&s;ually been his Bed-Chamber: the next Morning, it was carried into the great Hall; where it remain'd till the Lords came; who arriv'd there in the Afternoon, and immediately went to Colonel <HI>Whitchcot,</HI> the Governour of the Ca&s;tle, and &s;hew'd the Order they had from the Parliament to be pre&s;ent at the Burial; <MILESTONE N="10"> which he admitted; but when they de&s;ired that his Maje&s;ty might be Buried according to the form of the Common-Prayer Book, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> being pre&s;ent with them to officiate, he po&s;itively and rough|ly refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to it; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;it was not Lawful; that the Common-Prayer Book was put down, and he would not &s;uffer it to&endq; be u&s;ed in that Garri&s;on where He Commanded;</Q> nor could all the rea&s;ons, per&s;wa&s;ions, and entreaties, prevail with him to &s;uffer it. Then they went into the Church, to make choice of a place for burial. But when they enter'd into it, which they had been &s;o well acquainted with, they found it &s;o alter'd and transform'd, all In&s;criptions, and <MILESTONE N="20"> tho&s;e Land-Marks pulled down, by which all Men knew every par|ticular place in That Church, and &s;uch a di&s;mal mutation over the whole, that they knew not where they were: nor was there one old Officer that had belonged to it, or knew where our Princes had u&s;ed to be interr'd. At la&s;t there was a Fellow of the Town who under|took to tell them the place, where, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;there was a Vault, in which King <HI>Harry</HI> the Eighth and Queen <HI>Jane Seymour</HI> were in|terr'd.&endq;</Q> As near that place as could conveniently be, they cau&s;ed the Grave to be made. There the King's Body was laid without any words, or other Ceremonies than the tears and &s;ighs of the few beholders <MILESTONE N="30"> Upon the Coffin was a plate of Silver fixt with the&s;e words only, <HI>King Charles</HI> 1648. When the Coffin was put in, the black Velvet Pall that had cover'd it was thrown over it, and then the Earth thrown in; which the Governour &s;tayed to &s;ee perfectly done, and then took the Keys of the Church.</P>
<P>I HAVE been the longer, and the more particular in this relation, that I may from thence take occa&s;ion to mention what fell out long after, and which admini&s;ter'd a &s;ubject of much di&s;cour&s;e; in which, according to the &s;everal humours and fancies of Men, they who were in neare&s;t credit and tru&s;t about the King, underwent many very &s;e|vere <MILESTONE N="40"> Cen&s;ures and Reproaches, not without reflection upon the King him&s;elf. Upon the return of King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd with &s;o much congratulation, and univer&s;al Joy of the People, above ten years af|ter the Murther of his Father, it was generally expected that the Body &s;hould be removed from that ob&s;cure burial, and, with &s;uch Cere|mony as &s;hould be thought fit, &s;hould be &s;olemnly depo&s;ited with his Royal Ance&s;tors in King <HI>Harry</HI> the Seventh's Chapel in the Collegiate Church of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> And the King him&s;elf intended nothing more, and &s;poke often of it, as if it were only deferr'd till &s;ome Circum&s;tances and Ceremonies in the doing it might be adju&s;ted. But, by degrees, <MILESTONE N="50"> the di&s;cour&s;e of it was dimini&s;hed, as if it were totally laid a&s;ide upon &s;ome rea&s;ons of State, the ground whereof &s;everal Men gue&s;&s;ed at
<PB N="201" REF="2210">
according to their fancies, and thereupon ca&s;t tho&s;e reproaches upon the States-men as they thought rea&s;onable, when the rea&s;ons which were &s;ugge&s;ted by their own imaginations, did not &s;atisfy their under|&s;tanding. For the &s;atisfaction and information of all Men, I choo&s;e in this place to explain that matter; which, it may be, is not known to many; and at that time was not, for many rea&s;ons, thought fit to be publi&s;hed. The Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> was dead before the King re|turn'd; the Marquis of <HI>Hertford</HI> died in a &s;hort time after, and was &s;eldom out of his Lodging after his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>White-Hall:</HI> the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> went to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"> took with them &s;uch of their own Servants as had attended them in that Service, and as many others as they remember'd had been then pre&s;ent, and were &s;till alive; who all amounted to a &s;mall Number; there being, at the time of the Interment, great &s;trictne&s;s u&s;ed in ad|mitting any to be pre&s;ent who&s;e names were not included in the Or|der which the Lords had brought. In a word, the confu&s;ion they had at that time ob&s;erv'd to be in that Church, and the &s;mall alterations which were begun to be made towards decency, &s;o totally perplexed their Memories, that they could not &s;atisfy them&s;elves in what place, or part of the Church the Royal Body was interr'd: Yet, where any <MILESTONE N="20"> concurr'd upon this, or that place, they cau&s;ed the ground to be open'd at a good di&s;tance, and, upon &s;uch Enquiries, found no Cau&s;e to be|lieve that they were near the place: and, upon their giving this Ac|count to the King, the thought of that remove was laid a&s;ide; and the rea&s;on communicated to very few, for the better di&s;countenancing far|ther Enquiry.</P>
<P>THOUGH this wicked and abominable Action had to a degree &s;a|tisfied their malice, it had not enough provided for their ambition or &s;ecurity. They had no &s;ooner freed them&s;elves from one, than an|other King was grown up in his place. And be&s;ides the old Royal Par|ty, <MILESTONE N="30"> which continued &s;till vigorous, notwith&s;tanding their lo&s;s of &s;o much Blood, and (which weakens allmo&s;t as much) of &s;o great E&s;tates, they did apprehend that there were in the va&s;t number of the guilty (who quietly looked on upon the removal of the old, whom they had &s;o grievou&s;ly offended) who would yet be very willing to &s;ubmit, and be obedient to the new King; who was like to find more Friends abroad, as well as at home, than his Father had done. And therefore they made ha&s;t to prevent this threatning evil, by publi&s;hing a Procla|mation, <Q>&startq;that no Per&s;on what&s;oever &s;hould pre&s;ume to declare <HI>Charles</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proclama|tion again&s;t proclaiming</HI> Charles Stuart <HI>King.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Stuart,</HI> Son of the late <HI>Charles,</HI> commonly called the Prince of <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Wales,</HI> or any other Per&s;on, to be King, or Chief Magi&s;trate of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> or of any Dominions belonging thereunto, by co|lour of Inheritance, Succe&s;&s;ion, Election, or any other Claim what|&s;oever; and that whoever, contrary to this Act, pre&s;ume to pro|claim <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be deem'd and adjudged a Traytor, and &s;uffer ac|cordingly.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>IN the next place, that their Infant Republick might be nur&s;ed, cheri&s;hed, and brought up by tho&s;e only who had gotten and brought it forth, they re&s;olv'd to take away and aboli&s;h the Hou&s;e of Peers; and Voted, <Q>&startq;that they would make no farther Addre&s;&s;es to the Hou&s;e <MILESTONE N="50"> of Lords, nor receive any more from them: that the Hou&s;e of Peers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Common$ aboli&s;h the Hou&s;e of Peers</NOTE> in Parliament, was u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous; and that an Act &s;hould
<PB N="202" REF="2220">
be brought in for aboli&s;hing it: that the Privilege of the Peers of be|ing&endq; freed from Arre&s;ts, &s;hould be declared null and void;</Q> all which was done within few days. However, they declared, <Q>&startq;that the Peers&endq; &s;hould have the Privilege to be elected Knights,</Q> or Burge&s;&s;es; of which gracious conce&s;&s;ion &s;ome of them took the benefit &s;oon after, and &s;ate, upon their Election into vacant places, in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>THERE remain'd yet another provi&s;ion to be made again&s;t their own Ambition; for it was well known, that there were yet among&s;t them many who were not equally fond of a Common-wealth; and <MILESTONE N="10"> therefore they declared, <Q>&startq;that it had been found by experience, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vote again&s;t the Office of King&s;hip.</NOTE> the Office of a King in this Nation, or to have the power thereof in any &s;ingle Per&s;on, was unnece&s;&s;ary, burthen&s;om, and dangerous to the liberty, and &s;afety, and publick Intere&s;t of the Nation; and there|fore that it &s;hould be utterly aboli&s;hed; and to that purpo&s;e an Act&endq; &s;hould be forthwith prepared: which was likewi&s;e done, and pa&s;s'd.</Q> And by this Triple Cord they believ'd their Republick would be &s;trong|ly compacted, and &s;ufficiently provided for.</P>
<P>THEIR new Great Seal was by this time ready; whereon was en|graven, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They make a new Great Seal.</NOTE> on one &s;ide, the Armes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with this In|&s;cription, <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>The Great Seal of England;</HI> and on the other &s;ide the Por|traiture of the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;itting, circum&s;cribed, <HI>In the fir&s;t year of freedom by God's ble&s;&s;ing re&s;tored,</HI> 1648. The Cu&s;tody of this Great Seal was committed to three Lawyers, whereof one had &s;ate among the King's Judges, and the others had contributed too much to their Service. All things being now in this good Order, they &s;ent for their Judges, to agree upon the formality and circum&s;tances of Proceedings. <Q>For it was declared by the Parliament, &startq;that they were fully re&s;olv'd to maintain, and uphold the fundamental Laws of the Nation, in order to the pre&s;ervation of the Lives, Property, and Li|berty <MILESTONE N="30"> of the People, notwith&s;tanding all the alterations made in the&endq; Government for the good of the People:</Q> And the Writs were no more to run in the King's Name, as they had allways done, but the Name, Style, and Te&s;t, to be <HI>Cu&s;todes Libertatis Angliae, authori|tate Parliamenti.</HI> If it were not a thing &s;o notoriou&s;ly known, it could not be believ'd, that of twelve Judges, whereof ten were of their own making, and the other two had quietly &s;ubmitted, from the be|ginning of the War, to the Authority that govern'd, &s;ix laid down their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Six of their own Judges give up.</NOTE> places, and could not give them&s;elves leave to accept Commi&s;&s;ions from the new E&s;tabli&s;hed power.

<P>CARDINAL <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who, in the Infancy of the <HI>French</HI> King, managed that Scepter, had long adored the conduct of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ought his Friend&s;hip by a lower and viler application than was &s;uita|ble to the purple of a Cardinal, &s;ent now to be admitted as a Merchant to traffick in the purcha&s;e of the rich Goods and Jewels of the ri&s;$ed Crown; of which he purcha&s;ed the rich Beds, Hangings, and Carpets, which furni&s;hed his Palace at <HI>Paris.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> had, from the beginning of the Rebellion, kept <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> who had been his Emba&s;&s;adour to the King, re&s;iding &s;till at <HI>London;</HI> and He had, upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, many Audiences from the Parliament, and &s;everal Treaties on foot; and a&s;&s;oon as this di&s;mal Murther was over, that Emba&s;&s;adour, who had allways a great malignity towards <MILESTONE N="20"> the King, bought as many Pictures, and other precious Goods apper|taining to the Crown, as, being &s;ent in Ships to the <HI>Corunna</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> were carried from thence to <HI>Madrid</HI> upon Eighteen Mules. <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> purcha&s;ed the choice of all the Medals, and Jewels, and &s;ome Pictures of a great price, and receiy'd the Parliament's Agent with great Joy, and Pomp, and made an Alliance with them. The Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> who was Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> disbur&s;ed a great Sum of Money for many of the be&s;t Pictures, which adorned the &s;e|veral Palaces of the King; which were all brought to him to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and from thence carried by him into <HI>Germany.</HI> In this manner did <MILESTONE N="30"> the Neighbour Princes joyn to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI> with very great Sums of Money, whereby he was enabled to pro&s;ecute, and fini&s;h his wicked Victory over what yet remain'd unconquer'd, and to extingui&s;h Mo|narchy in this renown'd Kingdom; whil&s;t they enriched and adorned them&s;elves with the Ruins and Spoiles of the &s;urviving Heir, without applying any part thereof to his Relief, in the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ities which ever King was &s;ubject to. And that which is &s;tranger than all this (&s;ince mo&s;t Men, by recovering their fortunes, u&s;e to recover mo&s;t of what they were before robbed of, many who joyn'd in the Rob|bery pretending that they took care to pre&s;erve it for the true Owner) <MILESTONE N="40"> not one of all the&s;e Princes ever re&s;tored any of their unlawful purcha&s;es to the King, after his ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>WHILST the&s;e perfidious wretches had their hands &s;till reeking in the precious blood of their Soveraign, they were put upon a new piece of Butchery, as nece&s;&s;ary to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of their new Tyranny. The King was no &s;ooner dead, but they declared, as hath been &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that from this time <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be govern'd as a Common-wealth&endq; by the Parliament; that is, by that handful of Men, who by their wi&s;dom and power had wrought this wonderful alteration.</Q> And be|cau&s;e the number of tho&s;e appear'd very &s;mall, and the number of tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="50"> they had excluded was as vi&s;ible, they made an Order and Declaration, <Q>&startq;that as many of the Members who had been excluded, as would, under
<PB N="204" REF="2240">
their hands, approve all that had been done during the time they were excluded, &s;hould return to their Seats in the Hou&s;e without&endq; any prejudice for the future.</Q> Hereupon divers went again into the Hou&s;e, &s;atisfying them&s;elves that they were not guilty of the Inno|cent Royal Blood that had been &s;pilt; and &s;o their number increa&s;ed. They had made a new Great Seal, as hath been &s;aid, and called the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were entru&s;ted with the keeping thereof, <HI>The Keepers of the Liberties of England.</HI> And the Court of King's Bench they called the <HI>Upper</HI> Bench, and appointed certain Per&s;ons to con|&s;ider of &s;uch alterations as were nece&s;&s;ary to be made in the Laws of <MILESTONE N="$$"> <HI>England,</HI> in regard of &s;o important a mutation. That they might have &s;ome obligation of obedience from their Subjects for the future, who had broken all the former Oaths which they had taken, a new Oath <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Oath im|po&s;ed called the Engage|ment.</NOTE> was prepared and e&s;tabli&s;hed, which they called an <HI>Engagement;</HI> the form whereof was, that every Man &s;hould &s;wear, <Q>&startq;that he would be true and faithful to the Government e&s;tabli&s;hed without King or&endq; Hou&s;e of Peers: and who&s;oever refu&s;ed to take that Engagement &s;hould be incapable of holding any place, or office in Church or State.</Q> The nece&s;&s;ity of taking which Oath did not only exclude all of the Royal Party, but freed them from very many who had Offices in Church <MILESTONE N="20"> and State, who, being of the Presbyterian Party, dur&s;t not &s;acrifice their beloved Covenant to this new Engagement. And &s;o they filled many con&s;iderable places both in the one, and the other, with Men throughly prepared for their Service. But before they could model and fini&s;h all this, and whil&s;t it was preparing, they had, in &s;everal parts of the Kingdom, terrified the People with Blood-Spectacles, in the executing many of the Per&s;ons who had been taken. And that all hopes and pretences might be taken away from their Subjects, the Peers of <HI>England,</HI> that they &s;hould hereafter have any thing to do in declaring what the fundamental Laws of the Land were, a new <MILESTONE N="30"> High Court of Ju&s;tice was appointed to &s;it for the Trial of Duke <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new High Court of Ju|&s;tice &s;its; and &s;everal Trials before them.</NOTE> the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> and another Gentleman, one S^r <HI>John Owen</HI> (who, having been here|tofore a Colonel in the King's Army, had, in a late In&s;urrection in <HI>Wales,</HI> killed the High Sheriff) that they might &s;ee there &s;hould here|after be no more di&s;tinction of Quality in Trials for Life, but that the greate&s;t Lord and the Commoners &s;hould undergo the &s;ame Judica|tory, and form of Trial.

He had attempted to make an E&s;cape; in which he had &s;o well &s;ucceeded, that he was out of his Enemies hands full three days; but, being impatient to be at a greater di&s;tance from them, he was apprehended as he was taking Hor&s;e in <HI>Southwark;</HI> and carried Pri&s;oner into the Tower; from whence he was brought, with the others, before that High Court of Ju&s;tice.

nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e an Army for the relief of their King, and con|&s;tituted Him General of that Army, it was not Lawful for him to refu&s;e the Command thereof; and whatever misfortune he had un|dergone with it, he could not be under&s;tood to be liable to any pu|ni&s;hment&endq; but what a Pri&s;oner of War was bound to undergo.</Q> He was told, <Q>&startq;that the Rights and Laws of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> were not called in Que&s;tion, nor could be violated by Their pro|ceedings again&s;t Him, who was a Subject of <HI>England;</HI> again&s;t which he was charged with Rebellion and Trea&s;on: that they did not pro|ceed again&s;t him as Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but as Earl of <HI>Cam|bridge&endq;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> in <HI>England,</HI> and they would judge him as &s;uch.</Q> The Earl <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Then the Earl of</HI> Holland.</NOTE> of <HI>Holland</HI> was not at that time in a good di&s;po&s;ition of Health, and &s;o an&s;wer'd little, as a Man that would rather receive his life by their favour, than from the &s;trength of his defence.

<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel</HI> appear'd undaunted, and utterly refu&s;ed to &s;ub|mit <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Capel.</NOTE> to their juri&s;diction; <Q>&startq;that in the condition and capacity of a Soldier and a Pri&s;oner of War, he &s;aid, the Lawyers and Gown-men had nothing to do with him, and therefore he would not An&s;wer&endq; to any thing which they had &s;aid again&s;t him</Q> <HI>(Steel</HI> having treated him with great rudene&s;s and in&s;olence) but in&s;i&s;ted upon <Q>&startq;the Law of Nations, which exempted all Pri&s;oners, though &s;ubmitting to <MILESTONE N="30"> Mercy, from death, if it was not inflicted within &s;o many days;&endq; which were long &s;ince expired.</Q> <Q>He urged &startq;the Declaration which <HI>Fairfax</HI> the General had made to Him, and the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners, after the death of S^r <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> and S^r <HI>George Li&s;le,</HI> that no other of their Lives &s;hould be in danger, which he had Witne&s;&s;es&endq; ready to prove, if they might be admitted;</Q> and concluded, <Q>&startq;that, if he had committed any Offence worthy of death, he might be tried by his Peers; which was his Right by the Laws of the Land; the&endq; benefit whereof he required.</Q> <HI>Ireton,</HI> who was pre&s;ent, and &s;ate as one of his Judges, denied <Q>&startq;that the General had made any &s;uch pro|mi&s;e, <MILESTONE N="40"> and if he had, that the Parliament's Authority could not be&endq; re&s;train'd thereby;</Q> and put him in mind of his Carriage at that time, and how much he neglected then the General's civility. <Q>The other in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on the promi&s;e; and urged &startq;that the General might be &s;ent&endq; for, and examined;</Q> which they knew not how to deny, but, in re|gard of his indi&s;po&s;ition of Health, they &s;aid <Q>&startq;they would &s;end to&endq; him, whil&s;t they proceeded again&s;t S^r <HI>John Owen,</HI> who was the other Pri&s;oner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE an&s;wer'd them without any application, &startq;that he was a plain <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> John Owen</NOTE> Gentleman of <HI>Wales,</HI> who had been allways taught to obey the King; <MILESTONE N="50"> that he had &s;erv'd him hone&s;tly during the War, and finding after|wards that many hone&s;t Men endeavour'd to rai&s;e Forces, whereby

<P>WHETHER the Que&s;tion was well &s;tated to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> or what was el&s;e &s;aid to him to di&s;&s;wade him from owning his Declaration and pro|mi&s;e, he boggled &s;o much in his An&s;wer, that they would be of opi|nion, <Q>&startq;that he had not made &s;uch direct and po&s;itive promi&s;e; and that the &s;ame was never tran&s;mitted to the Parliament; which it <MILESTONE N="10"> ought to have been; and that, at mo&s;t, it could but exempt tho&s;e Pri&s;oners from being tried before a Court, or Council of War, and could not be under&s;tood as an obligation upon the Parliament, not to give direction to &s;uch a legal Proceeding again&s;t them, as they&endq; &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary for the Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom.</Q> The Pre&s;ident <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI> told the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> with many in&s;olent expre&s;|&s;ions, <Q>&startq;that he was tried before &s;uch Judges as the Parliament thought&endq; fit to a&s;&s;ign him; and who had judged a better Man than him&s;elf.</Q> So the Sentence of death was pronounced again&s;t all five of them, <Q>&startq;that&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">All five con|demn'd.</NOTE> they &s;hould lo&s;e their heads;</Q> upon which S^r <HI>John Owen</HI> made a low <MILESTONE N="20"> reverence, and gave them humble thanks, and being asked by a Stander by, <Q>&startq;&endq;what he meant?</Q> he &s;aid aloud, <Q>&startq;it was a very great honour to a poor Gentleman of <HI>Wales</HI> to lo&s;e his head with &s;uch noble&endq; Lords;</Q> and &s;wore a great Oath, <Q>&startq;that he was afraid they would have&endq; hanged him.</Q></P>
<P>THE Pri&s;oners were all carried to S^t <HI>James</HI>'s; where they were to remain till their Execution two days after; which time their Friends, and Relations, had to endeavour to pre&s;erve their lives by the Power and Authority of the Parliament; where there were &s;o many &s;itting who had not &s;ate in judgement upon them, and who were of &s;everal <MILESTONE N="30"> Affections, and liable to &s;everal temptations, that there might be a rea&s;onable hope to re&s;cue them from the cruel and unju&s;t Judgement. Their Wives, and Children, and Friends, left no way untried to pre|vail; offer'd, and gave Money to &s;ome who were willing to receive it, and made promi&s;es accordingly. But they who had the greate&s;t credit, and mo&s;t power to terrify others who &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e them, were inexorable; yet dealt &s;o much more hone&s;tly than the re&s;t, that they declared to the Ladies, who &s;ollicited for their Husbands and their Fathers, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they would not endeavour to do them Service.</Q> <HI>Ireton,</HI> above all Men, continued his in&s;olent and dogged humour, and <MILESTONE N="40"> told them, <Q>&startq;&endq;if He had credit, they &s;hould all dye. Others, who gave better Words, had no better Meaning than he.</Q></P>
<P>ALL their Petitions were read in order, being penn'd in &s;uch Styles as the Friends, who &s;ollicited for them, were advi&s;ed. Duke <HI>Hamil|ton</HI>'s Petition being read, many, upon the motives of Ju&s;tice, and as they imagined, his death might be the occa&s;ion of new troubles be|tween the two Nations, &s;ince <HI>Scotland</HI> could not but re&s;ent it, would have been willing he &s;hould live. But he had fewer Friends to his Per&s;on than any of the re&s;t; and <HI>Cromwell</HI> knew well that his being out of the way would not be unacceptable to them upon whom the <MILESTONE N="50"> Peace of that Kingdom depended: &s;o that when his Petition was read, it was rejected by very much the Major part of Voices. The con|fideration
<PB N="207" REF="2270">
of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> took up a long debate: the Intere&s;t and Interpo&s;ition of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> his Brother, was apply'd; and every Presbyterian, to a Man, was &s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve him. They urged <Q>&startq;his merit towards the Parliament in the beginning of the Troubles; how much he had &s;uffer'd in the Court for his affe|ction to them: his Age, and Infirmities, which would not &s;uffer him long to enjoy that life they &s;hould give him: and the con&s;ideration&endq; of his Wife, and Children, which were numerous.</Q> But the&s;e Ar|guments &s;tirr'd up others, to inveigh again&s;t his back&s;lidings with the more bitterne&s;s, and to undervalue the &s;ervices he had ever done; <MILESTONE N="10"> to tax his vanities, and his breach of faith. When the Que&s;tion was put concerning him, they who were for the Negative, exceeded the number of the other by three or four Votes; <HI>Cromwell</HI> having more than an ordinary animo&s;ity again&s;t him, for his behaviour in the be|ginning of the Summer, and for &s;ome words of neglect and contempt he had let fall concerning him&s;elf. The Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> came next upon the &s;tage; who having allways lived a chearful and jovial Life, without contracting many Enemies, had many there who wi&s;h'd him well, and few who had animo&s;ity again&s;t him; &s;o that when the Que|&s;tion was put concerning him, the Hou&s;e was equally divided, the <MILESTONE N="20"> Votes which rejected his Petition, and tho&s;e which would pre&s;erve his Life, were equal: &s;o that his life or death depended upon the &s;in|gle Vote of the Speaker; who told the Hou&s;e, <Q>&startq;that he had receiv'd many obligations from that Lord; and that once when he had been like to have incurr'd the King's di&s;plea&s;ure, by &s;ome mi&s;information,&endq; which would have been very penal to him,</Q> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> (un|der which &s;tyle he was treated, the additional of <HI>Norwich</HI> not being allow'd by them upon their old Rule) <Q>&startq;had by his credit pre&s;erv'd him, and remov'd the Prejudice that was again&s;t him; and there|fore&endq; he was oblig'd in gratitude to give his Vote for the &s;aving him.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"> By this good fortune he came to be pre&s;erv'd; whether the ground of it were true or no, or whether the Speaker made it only as an excu&s;e for &s;aving any Man's Life who was put to ask it in that place.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> &s;hortly after he was brought Pri&s;oner to the Tower from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle, had by a wonderful adventure, having a Cord and all things nece&s;&s;ary convey'd to him, let him&s;elf down out of the Window of his Chamber in the night, over the Wall of the Tower; and had been directed through what part of the Ditch he might be be&s;t able to wade. Whether he found the right place, <MILESTONE N="40"> or whether there was no &s;afer place, he found the Water and the Mud &s;o deep, that, if he had not been by the head taller than other Men, he mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd, &s;ince the Water came up to his Chin. The way was &s;o long to the other &s;ide, and the fatigue of drawing him&s;elf out of &s;o much Mud &s;o intolerable, that his &s;pirits were near &s;pent, and he was once ready to call out for help, as thinking it better to be carried back again to the Pri&s;on, than to be found in &s;uch a place, from whence he could not extricate him&s;elf, and where he was ready to expire. But it plea&s;ed God, that he got at la&s;t to the other &s;ide; where his Friends expected him, and carried him to <MILESTONE N="50"> a Chamber in the Temple; where he remain'd two or three nights &s;ecure from any di&s;covery, notwith&s;tanding the diligence that could
<PB N="208" REF="2280">
not but be u&s;ed to recover a Man they de&s;ign'd to u&s;e no better. After two or three days a Friend whom he tru&s;ted much, and who de&s;erv'd to be tru&s;ted, conceiving that he might be more &s;ecure in a place to which there was le&s;s re&s;ort, and where there were &s;o many harbour'd who were every day &s;ought after, had provided a Lodging for him in a private Hou&s;e in <HI>Lambeth</HI> Mar&s;h; and calling upon him in an Evening, when it was dark, to go thither, they cho&s;e ra|ther to take any Boat they found ready at the Temple Stairs, than to tru&s;t one of that People with the &s;ecret; and it was &s;o late that there was one only Boat left there. In that the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> (as well di&s;|guis'd <MILESTONE N="$0"> as he thought nece&s;&s;ary) and his Friend, put them&s;elves, and bid the Waterman to row them to <HI>Lambeth.</HI> Whether, in their pa&s;|&s;age thither, the other Gentleman call'd him <HI>my Lord,</HI> as was con|fidently reported, or whether the Waterman had any jealou&s;y by ob|&s;erving what he thought was a di&s;gui&s;e, when they were landed, the wicked Waterman, undi&s;cern'd, follow'd them, till he &s;aw into what Hou&s;e they went; and then went to an Officer, and demanded, <Q>&startq;what he would give him to bring him to the place where the Lord&endq; <HI>Capel</HI> lay?</Q> and the Officer promi&s;ing to give him ten pounds, he led him pre&s;ently to the Hou&s;e, where that excellent Per&s;on was &s;ei|&s;ed <MILESTONE N="$0"> upon, and the next day carried to the Tower.</P>
<P>WHEN the Petition, that his Wife had deliver'd, was read, many Gentlemen &s;poke on his behalf; and mention'd the great virtues which were in him; and <Q>&startq;that he had never deceiv'd them, or pretended to be of their Party; but allways re&s;olutely declar'd him&s;elf for the&endq; King: and <HI>Cromwell,</HI></Q> who had known him very well, &s;poke &s;o much good of him, and profe&s;s'd to have &s;o much kindne&s;s and re|&s;pect for him, that all Men thought he was now &s;afe, when he con|cluded, <Q>&startq;that his affection to the Publick &s;o much weigh'd down his private Friend&s;hip, that he could not but tell them, that the Que|&s;tion <MILESTONE N="30"> was now, whether they would pre&s;erve the mo&s;t bitter and the mo&s;t implacable Enemy they had: that he knew the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> very well, and knew that he would be the la&s;t Man in <HI>England</HI> that would for&s;ake the Royal Intere&s;t; that he had great Courage, Indu&s;try, and Genero&s;ity; that he had many Friends who would all|ways adhere to him; and that as long as he liv'd, what condition &s;oever he was in, he would be a thorn in their &s;ides; and there|fore, for the good of the Common-wealth, he &s;hould give his Vote&endq; again&s;t the Petition.</Q> <HI>Ireton</HI>'s hatred was immortal: he &s;pake of him, and again&s;t him, as of a Man of whom he was heartily afraid. Very <MILESTONE N="40"> many were &s;way'd by the Argument that had been urg'd again&s;t Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> <Q>&startq;that God was not pleas'd that he &s;hould E&s;cape, becau&s;e&endq; he had put him into their hands again, when he was at liberty.</Q> And &s;o, after a long debate, though there was not a Man who had not a value for him, and very few who had a particular malice, or prejudice towards him, the Que&s;tion being put, the Negative was more by three or four Voices: So that, of the four Lords, three were without the mercy of that unmerciful People. There being no other Petition pre&s;ented, <HI>Ireton</HI> told them, <Q>&startq;there had been great Endea|vours and Sollicitation us'd to &s;ave all tho&s;e Lords; but that there <MILESTONE N="50"> was a Commoner, another condemn'd Per&s;on, for whom no one Man had &s;poke a word, nor had he him&s;elf &s;o much as petition'd

<P>A SCAFFOLD was erected before <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-</HI>Hall, and all the Pri|&s;oners condemn'd were brought from S^t <HI>James</HI>'s (as well the two who were repriev'd, as the three who were to &s;uffer) upon the ninth of <HI>March,</HI> that was at the end of the year 1648, a little more than a Month after the Murther of the King, to S^r <HI>Thomas Cotton</HI>'s Hou&s;e, <MILESTONE N="10"> at the upper end of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-</HI>Hall; where they were &s;uffer'd to re|po&s;e them&s;elves about the &s;pace of an hour, and then were led &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively through the Hall to the Scaffold, Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> being fir&s;t; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil|ton <HI>be$$ade$</HI> March 9.</NOTE> who &s;eem'd yet to have &s;ome hope of a Reprieve, and made &s;ome &s;tay in the Hall, till the Earl of <HI>Denbigh</HI> came to him; and, after a &s;hort whi&s;per, in which he found there was no hope, he a&s;cended the Scaf|fold. He complain'd much of <Q>&startq;the inju&s;tice that was done him; and that he was put to death for obeying the Laws of his Country; which&endq; if he had not done, he mu&s;t have been put to death there.</Q> He ac|knowledged the obligations he had to the King, and &s;eem'd not &s;orry <MILESTONE N="20"> for the gratitude he had expre&s;&s;ed, how dear &s;oever it co&s;t him. His natural darkne&s;s, and re&s;ervation in his di&s;cour&s;e, made him to be thought a Wi&s;e man, and his having been in Command under the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and his continual di&s;cour&s;es of Battles, and Fortifications, made him be thought a great Soldier. And both the&s;e mi&s;takes were the Cau&s;e that made him be looked upon as a wor&s;e and a more dan|gerous Man, than in truth he de&s;erv'd to be.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was brought next, who, by his long &s;ickne&s;s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Holland <HI>the &s;ame day.</HI></NOTE> was &s;o &s;pent, that his Spirits &s;erv'd not to entertain the People with long di&s;cour&s;e. <Q>He &s;poke of &startq;his Religion, as a matter unque&s;tion|able, <MILESTONE N="30"> by the education he had had in the Religious Family of which&endq; he was a branch:</Q> which was thought a &s;trange di&s;cour&s;e for a dy|ing Man, who, though a Son, knew enough of the iniquity of his Fa|ther's Hou&s;e, which &s;hould rather have been buried in &s;ilence, than, by &s;uch an un&s;ea&s;onable Te&s;timony, have been revived in the memory and di&s;cour&s;e of Men. He took more care to be thought a good friend to Parliaments, than a good Servant to his Ma&s;ter, and was thought to &s;ay too little of his having failed &s;o much in his Duty to him, which mo&s;t good Men believ'd to be the Source from whence his pre&s;ent ca|lamity &s;prung. He was a very well bred Man, and a fine Gentleman <MILESTONE N="40"> in good times; but too much de&s;ired to enjoy ea&s;e and plenty, when the King could have neither; and did think Poverty the mo&s;t in&s;up|portable evil that could befal any Man in this world. He was then &s;o weak that he could not have liv'd long; and when his head was cut off, very little blood follow'd.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel</HI> was then called; who walked through <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter-</HI>Hall, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Capel.</NOTE> &s;aluting &s;uch of his Friends and Acquaintance as he &s;aw there, with a very &s;erene Countenance, accompanied with his Friend D^r <HI>Mor|ley;</HI> who had been with him from the time of his Sentence; but, at the &s;oot of the Scaffold, the Soldiers &s;topping the D^r, his Lord&s;hip took <MILESTONE N="50"> his leave of him; and, embracing him, thanked him; and &s;aid, he &s;hould go no farther, having &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that he might receive
<PB N="210" REF="2300">
&s;ome affront by that rude People after his death; the Chaplains who attended the two other Lords, being Men of the time, and the D^r being well known to be mo&s;t contrary.</P>
<P>ASSOON as his Lord&s;hip had a&s;cended the <HI>Scaffold,</HI> he looked very vigorou&s;ly about, and asked, <Q>&startq;whether the other Lords had &s;poken&endq; to the People with their Hats on?</Q> and being told, that <Q>&startq;they were&endq; bare;</Q> he gave his Hat to his Servant, and then with a clear and a &s;trong voice, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that he was brought thither to dye for doing that which he could not repent of: that he had been born, and bred under the Government of a King whom he was bound in Con&s;cience <MILESTONE N="10"> to obey; under Laws, to which he had been allways obedient; and in the bo&s;om of a Church, which he thought the be&s;t in the world: that he had never violated his Faith to either of tho&s;e, and was now condemn'd to dye again&s;t all the Laws of the Land; to which &s;en|tence&endq; he did &s;ubmit.</Q></P>
<P>HE enlarged him&s;elf in commending <Q>&startq;the great Virtue and Piety of the King, whom they had put to death; who was &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o&endq; merciful a Prince;</Q> and prayed to God, <Q>&startq;to forgive the Nation that innocent Blood. Then he recommended to them the pre&s;ent King;&endq;</Q> who, he told them, <Q>&startq;was their true and their Lawful Soveraign; <MILESTONE N="20"> and was worthy to be &s;o: that he had the honour to have been &s;ome&endq; years near his Per&s;on, and therefore he could not but know him well;</Q> and a&s;&s;ured them, <Q>&startq;that he was a Prince of great under&s;tanding, of an excellent Nature, of great Courage, an entire Lover of Ju&s;tice, and of exemplary Piety: that he was not to be &s;haken in his Reli|gion; and had all tho&s;e Princely Virtues, which could make a Na|tion&endq; happy:</Q> <Q>and therefore advi&s;ed them &startq;to &s;ubmit to his Govern|ment, as the only means to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, their Po&s;terity, and&endq; the Prote&s;tant Religion.</Q> And having, with great vehemence, recom|mended it to them, after &s;ome prayers very devoutly pronounced upon <MILESTONE N="30"> his Knees, he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf, with an unparallel'd Chri&s;tian Cou|rage, to the fatal &s;troke, which depriv'd the Nation of the noble&s;t Cham|pion it had.</P>
<P>HE was a Man in whom the Malice of his Enemies could di&s;cover <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Capel<HI>'s Cha|racter.</HI></NOTE> very few faults, and whom his Friends could not wi&s;h better accom|pli&s;hed; whom <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s own Character well de&s;cribed; and who indeed would never have been contented to have liv'd under that Go|vernment. His Memory all Men loved and reverenced, though few follow'd his Example. He had allways liv'd in a State of great plen|ty and general e&s;timation, having a very noble Fortune of his own <MILESTONE N="40"> by de&s;cent, and a fair Addition to it by his Marriage with an excel|lent Wife, a Lady of very worthy Extraction, of great Virtue and Beauty, by whom he had a numerous I&s;&s;ue of both Sexes, in which he took great Joy and Comfort: &s;o that no Man was more happy in all his Dome&s;tick Affairs; and he was &s;o much the more happy, in that he thought him&s;elf mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>AND yet the King's Honour was no &s;ooner violated, and his ju&s;t power invaded, than he threw all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings behind him; and having no other obligations to the Crown, than tho&s;e which his own Honour and Con&s;cience &s;ugge&s;ted to him, he frankly engaged his Per|&s;on <MILESTONE N="50"> and his Fortune from the beginning of the Troubles, as many others did, in all Actions and Enterpri&s;es of the greate&s;t hazard and danger;
<PB N="211" REF="2310">
and continued to the end, without ever making one fal&s;e &s;tep, as few others did, though he had once, by the iniquity of a Faction, that then prevailed, an indignity put upon him that might have excu&s;ed him for &s;ome remi&s;&s;ion of his former warmth. But it made no other impre&s;&s;ion upon him, than to be quiet and contented, whil&s;t they would let him alone, and, with the &s;ame chearfulne&s;s, to obey the fir&s;t Summons when he was called out; which was quickly after. In a word, he was a Man, that whoever &s;hall, after Him, de&s;erve be&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, he can never think him&s;elf undervalued, when he &s;hall hear, that his Courage, Virtue, and Fidelity, is laid in the <MILESTONE N="10"> ballance with, and compared to that of the Lord <HI>Capel.</HI></P>
<P>So ended the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred forty eight; a year <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Conclu&s;ion and Character of the year</HI> 1648.</NOTE> of reproach and infamy above all years which had pa&s;&s;ed before it; a year of the highe&s;t di&s;&s;imulation and hypocri&s;y, of the deepe&s;t Vil|lainy and mo&s;t bloody Trea&s;ons, that any Nation was ever cur&s;ed with, or under: a year, in which the Memory of all the Tran&s;actions ought to be ra&s;ed out of all Records, le&s;t, by the &s;ucce&s;s of it, Athei&s;m, In|fidelity, and Rebellion, &s;hould be propagated in the world: a year, of which We may &s;ay, as the Hi&s;torian &s;aid of the time of <HI>Domitian, Sicut vetus aetas vidit, quid ultimum in libertate e&s;&s;et, it a nos quid in &s;ervi|tute;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> or, as the &s;ame Writer &s;ays of a time not altogether &s;o wicked, <HI>is habitus animorum fuit, ut pe&s;&s;imum facinus auderent pa$ci, plures vellent, omnes paterentur.</HI></P>

<P>_WHILST the&s;e Tragedies were acting in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The young King's condi|tion at the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> and Ordinances form'd, as hath been &s;aid, to make it penal in the highe&s;t degree for any Man to a&s;&s;ume the Title of King, or to acknowledge any Man to be &s;o, the King him&s;elf remain'd in a very di&s;con&s;olate condi|tion at the <HI>Hague.</HI> Though he had known the de&s;perate &s;tate his Father was long in, yet the barbarous &s;troke &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed him, that he was in all the confu&s;ion imaginable, and all <MILESTONE N="10"> about him were allmo&s;t bereft of their under&s;tanding. The truth is, it can hardly be conceiv'd, with what a con&s;ternation this terrible News was receiv'd by all, even by the Common People of that Country. There was a Woman at the <HI>Hague,</HI> of the midling rank, who, being with Child, with the horror of the mention of it, fell into travel, and in it died. There could not be more Evidence of a general dete&s;tation, than there was, among&s;t all Men of what Quality &s;oever. Within two or three days, which they gave to the King's recollection, the States pre|&s;ented <NOTE PLACE="marg">The States cond$l$ with him</NOTE> them&s;elves in a Body to his Maje&s;ty, to condole with him for the Murther of his Father, in terms of great &s;orrow, &s;ave that there was <MILESTONE N="20"> not bitterne&s;s enough again&s;t the Rebels and Murtherers.

of <HI>Holland,</HI> apart, perform'd the &s;ame civility towards his Maje&s;ty; and the Body of the Clergy, in a Latin Oration, deliver'd by the chief Preacher of the <HI>Hague,</HI> lamented the misfortune, in terms of as much a&s;perity, and dete&s;tation of the Actors, as unworthy the name of Chri|&s;tians, as could be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE de&s;peratene&s;s of the King's condition, could not excu&s;e his &s;ink|ing under the burthen of his grief: but tho&s;e who were about him be|&s;ought him to re&s;ume &s;o much Courage as was nece&s;&s;ary for his pre&s;ent State. He thereupon cau&s;ed tho&s;e of his Father's Council who had at|tended <NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Coun|c$l $wo$n.</NOTE> him, to be &s;worn of his Privy Council, adding only M^r <HI>Long</HI> his Secretary; who, before, was not of the Council. All which was done before he heard from the Queen his Mother; who, notwith&s;tanding the great Agony &s;he was in, which without doubt was as great a pa&s;&s;ion of &s;orrow as &s;he was able to &s;u&s;tain, wrote to the King, <Q>&startq;that he could <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's fir&s;t Me&s;&s;$ge to him.</NOTE> not do better, than to repair into <HI>France</HI> a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible, and, in the mean time, de&s;ired him, not to &s;wear any Per&s;ons to be of his&endq; Council, till She could &s;peak with him.</Q> Whether it was, that &s;he did not think tho&s;e Per&s;ons to be enough at her Devotion; or that &s;he would have them receive that honour upon Her recommendation.</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf had no mind to go into <HI>France,</HI> where he thought <MILESTONE N="$0"> he had not been treated with exce&s;s of courte&s;y; and he re&s;olv'd to per|form all filial re&s;pect towards the Queen his Mother, without &s;uch a conde&s;cen&s;ion and re&s;ignation of him&s;elf, as &s;he expected; and to avoid all eclarci&s;ments upon that Subject, he heartily de&s;ired that any other Cour&s;e might be found more Coun&s;ellable than that he &s;hould go into <HI>France.</HI> He him&s;elf liv'd with, and upon the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> who &s;upplied him with all things nece&s;&s;ary for his own Per&s;on, for his Mourn|ing, and the like: but towards any other &s;upport for him&s;elf and his Family, his Maje&s;ty had not enough to maintain them one day: and there were very few of them, who could maintain them&s;elves in the <MILESTONE N="30"> mo&s;t private way: and it was vi&s;ible enough, that they &s;hould not be long able to re&s;ide in the <HI>Hague;</HI> where there was, at that very time, an Agent for the Parliament, <HI>Strickland;</HI> who had been there &s;ome years, but pretended then to re&s;ide there with his Wife (who was born in <HI>Holland</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parents) and without any publick Character, though he was &s;till under the &s;ame Credentials. And their Adverti&s;e|ments from <HI>London</HI> a&s;&s;ured them, that the Parliament had nominated one, who was pre&s;ently to be &s;ent as their Emba&s;&s;adour, or Envoy to the States, to give them an Account of their Affairs, and to invite them to enter into an Alliance with them. So that it was time to think of <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ome other Retreat for the King; and none appeared then &s;o &s;ea&s;onable in their view, as <HI>Ireland;</HI> from whence they heard, <Q>&startq;that Prince <HI>Ru|pert</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King $$$nk$ of go|$n$ int$</HI> $$|$$nd <HI>T$$ Af|fair$ ther$ at that t$$$e.</HI></NOTE> was arriv'd &s;afely at <HI>Kin&s;ale</HI> with the Fleet: that the Lord <HI>In|chiquin</HI> had made a Ce&s;&s;ation with the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> before the Lord Lieute|nant came thither; and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had de&s;erted the Pope's Nuntio, who was driven away, and had embarked him&s;elf for <HI>France:</HI> that the Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond</HI> was receiv'd by the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> with all the obe|dience imaginable, by which he became entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole Province of <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> and that the Confederate Roman Catholicks had invited him to <HI>Kilkenny;</HI> where he had made a full Peace with them: <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;o that they were preparing an Army to march under his Command&endq; again&s;t <HI>Dublin.</HI></Q> This News made them hope, that every day would im|prove it &s;o much, that it would be fit for the King to tran&s;port his own Per&s;on thither in the Spring.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="2350">
IN this conjuncture there arriv'd a Gentleman, one S^r <HI>Jo&s;eph Dou|gla&s;s,</HI> with a Letter from the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by which they &s;ent his Maje&s;ty word that they had proclaim'd him King of <HI>Scotland;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pro|claim'd in</HI> Scotland; <HI>and Commi&s;&s;ioners thence &s;ent to him.</HI></NOTE> and &s;ent him the Proclamation; and wi&s;h'd, <Q>&startq;that he would prepare him&s;elf to repair into that his Kingdom; in order to which they would&endq; &s;peedily &s;end another Invitation to him.</Q> And that Invitation arriv'd at the &s;ame time with &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners deputed by the Council, and three or four Preachers &s;ent from the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Kirk. The Proclamation indeed declar'd, <Q>&startq;For that as much as the late King was, contrary to the Di&s;&s;ent, and Prote&s;tation of that Kingdom, remov'd <MILESTONE N="10"> by a violent death, that, by the Lord's Ble&s;&s;ing, there was left unto them a righteous Heir, and lawful Succe&s;&s;or, <HI>Charles</HI> &amp;c. who was&endq; become their true and lawful King;</Q> but upon condition of <Q>&startq;his good behaviour, and &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Covenant, and his entertain|ing no other Per&s;ons about him but &s;uch as were Godly Men, and&endq; faithful to that obligation.</Q> A Proclamation &s;o &s;trangely worded, that, though it call'd him their King, manife&s;ted enough to him, that he was to be &s;ubject to Their determinations, in all the parts of his Govern|ment. And the Commi&s;&s;ioners, both Laity and Clergy, &s;poke no other Language; and &s;aving that they bow'd their Bodies, and made low Re|verences, <MILESTONE N="20"> they appear'd more like Emba&s;&s;adors from a free State to an equal Ally, than like Subjects &s;ent to their own Soveraign. At the &s;ame time, though not in the &s;ame Ship, arriv'd likewi&s;e from <HI>Scotland</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lanrick, <HI>now Duke</HI> Hamil|ton, <HI>and</HI> Lau|therdale, <HI>came to him al&s;o.</HI></NOTE> Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Lautherdale;</HI> the former not knowing, till he came into <HI>Holland,</HI> that he was Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> by the &s;laughter of his Elder Brother. But they two were &s;o far from having any Autho|rity from their Country, that they were fled from thence as pro&s;crib'd Per&s;ons and Malefactors. The Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> after his departure from the <HI>Hague,</HI> in that di&s;content that is mention'd before, bent his Cour&s;e for <HI>Scotland.</HI> But before he came thither, he was inform'd, <MILESTONE N="30"> that the &s;tate of all things had been revers'd, and the Engagement de|clar'd unlawful, and to what penalties him&s;elf was liable, if he &s;hould be taken. Whereupon, without &s;uffering his Ship to go into any Port, he found means to &s;end on &s;hore to &s;ome Friends, and &s;o to concert all things, that without being di&s;cover'd, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and &s;ome other Per&s;ons, liable to danger if they were found, put them&s;elves on board the &s;ame Ship, and arriv'd in <HI>Holland</HI> about that time when the other Me&s;&s;engers from the State and from the Kirk came from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and when the News came of the Execution of Duke <HI>Ha|milton.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREUPON the new Duke kept his Chamber for &s;ome days, without &s;o much as waiting on the King; who &s;ent a gracious Me&s;&s;age to him to condole for the lo&s;s of his Brother; and all the Lords, and other Per&s;ons of Quality about the King, made their vi&s;its to him with all civility. This Duke was not inferior in Wi&s;dom, and Parts of Un|der&s;tanding, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Character of this Duke</HI> Hamilton.</NOTE> to the wi&s;e&s;t Man of that Nation, and was very much e&s;teem'd by tho&s;e who did not like the complying, and in&s;inuating Na|ture of his Brother. He was a Man of great honour, courage, and &s;in|cerity in his Nature, and, which was a rare virtue in the Men of that time, was &s;till the &s;ame Man he pretended to be; and had very much <MILESTONE N="50"> to &s;ay in his own defence for the Errors he had run into; which he ac|knowledg'd allways with great ingenuity, and abhorr'd the whole pro|ceedings of his Country-men; and, at this time, brought a heart, and

<P>THOUGH <HI>Cromwell,</HI> at his being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had left <HI>Argyle</HI> in full <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The condition of</HI> Scotland <HI>about this time.</HI></NOTE> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Government there, and had reduc'd, and disbanded all tho&s;e who were in Arms again&s;t him, and promis'd him all nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;ubdue tho&s;e who &s;hould ri&s;e again&s;t him in that Kingdom for the future, and thereby compell'd the Committee of E&s;tates to con|vene, and &s;ummon the Parliament to a&s;&s;emble, which they had autho|rity to do; and &s;o he had &s;uppre&s;s'd the Party of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> driven the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI> to hide him&s;elf in &s;ome ob&s;cure place, and condemn'd <MILESTONE N="10"> the Engagement as unlawful and &s;inful, and all the Per&s;ons who advanc'd and promoted it, as De&s;erters of the Covenant, and &s;o to &s;tand excom|municated, and not to be capable of &s;erving in Parliament, or in the Council of E&s;tate; &s;o that he was &s;ure to find no oppo&s;ition in what|&s;oever he propos'd; yet, after the Parliament had &s;erv'd him &s;o far, when they heard that the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> was broken, and their freedom and Privileges were taken from them by the in&s;olence, and power of the Army (which they perfectly hated and dete&s;ted, and all tho&s;e Sects and Libertini&s;m they heard were introduc'd in Religion con|trary to their Covenant, which <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf had promis'd &s;hould <MILESTONE N="20"> be &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd) they begun to examine, what the obligations were which were incumbent upon them even by the Covenant it &s;elf. The delivery of the King's Per&s;on into the hands of the Parliament at <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> had been, in the in&s;tant it was done, the mo&s;t unpopular, and un|gracious act to the whole Nation of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that it had been ever guilty of, and to the Army they had then on foot, which took it &s;elf to be deeply wounded by the infamy of it, and was therefore quickly dis|banded by the cunning of <HI>Argyle:</HI> and the univer&s;al indignation again&s;t that action was the principal incitement to that general Engagement with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that the honour of the Nation might in &s;ome de|gree <MILESTONE N="30"> be repair'd, or redeem'd.

<P>THERE were at this time in the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ioners who came from the Council and the Kirk to invite the King into <HI>Scotland,</HI> or rather to let him know upon what terms he might come thither, Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and others of the Nobility of that Faction, who were now as odious, and as much per&s;ecuted by <MILESTONE N="30"> that Party, which then govern'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which in that manner invited the King, as any Men were who had &s;erv'd the King from the beginning. There was al&s;o the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> with more of the Nobility, as the Earls of <HI>Seaford,</HI> and <HI>Kinoul,</HI> and others, who ad|her'd to <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> and believ'd his clear Spirit to be mo&s;t like to advance the King's Service. Of the&s;e three Parties, it might rea&s;onably <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parties of the</HI> Scots <HI>now at the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> have been hoped that the two la&s;t, being equally per&s;ecuted by the power that govern'd, &s;hould have been ea&s;ily united to have &s;uppre&s;s'd the other. But it was a bu&s;ine&s;s too hard for the King to bring to pa&s;s; and he could as ea&s;ily have per&s;waded the Parliament to reject <HI>Crom|well,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> as the Lords of the <HI>Engagement,</HI> and tho&s;e who had joyn'd with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to be reconciled to <HI>Mountro&s;e:</HI> &s;o that when the King hoped to have drawn all the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nobility together, to have con|&s;ulted what An&s;wer he &s;hould give to the Me&s;&s;ages he had receiv'd from the Council and the Kirk, with which they them&s;elves were enough offended, tho&s;e Lords of the <HI>Engagement</HI> did not only refu&s;e to meet with the Lord <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> but, a&s;&s;oon as he came into the room where they were, though his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, they immediately withdrew, and left the room; and had the confidence to de&s;ire the King, <Q>&startq;that the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> (whom they called <HI>James Graham)</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> might be forbidden to come into his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence, or Court, becau&s;e he &s;tood excommunicated by the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and de|graded&endq; and forfeited by the Judicatory of that Kingdom.</Q>
<PB N="225" REF="2430">
This propo&s;ition and demand they made confidently in writing under their hands, and abounded &s;o much in this &s;en&s;e, that a learned and worthy <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Divine, D^r <HI>Wi&s;hart,</HI> who was then Chaplain to a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Regiment in the &s;ervice of the States, being appointed to preach before the King on the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, they formally be&s;ought the King, <Q>&startq;that he would not &s;uffer him to preach before him, nor to come into his pre&s;ence, becau&s;e he &s;tood excommunicated by the Kirk of <HI>Scot|land,&endq;</HI></Q> for having refus'd to take the Covenant; though it was known, that the true cau&s;e of the di&s;plea&s;ure they had again&s;t that Divine was, that they knew he was the Author of the excellent Relation of the <MILESTONE N="10"> Lord <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI>'s Actions in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This carriage and behaviour of tho&s;e Lords appear'd ridiculous to all &s;ober Men, that any Men &s;hould have the pre&s;umption to accu&s;e tho&s;e who had &s;erv'd the King with that fidelity, and were only branded by tho&s;e Rebellious Judicatories for having perform'd their duties of Allegiance, and to demand that the King him&s;elf &s;hould condemn them for having &s;erv'd his Father: which made tho&s;e of his Maje&s;tie's Council full of indignation at their in&s;olence, and his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf declar'd his being offended, by u&s;ing the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> with the more countenance, and hearing the Doctor preach with the more attention. But from this very ab&s;urd be|haviour, <MILESTONE N="20"> be&s;ides his Maje&s;tie's de&s;ire being fru&s;trated, of receiving the joynt advice of the Nobility of that Kingdom in an affair that &s;o much concern'd him&s;elf and them; and be&s;ides the di&s;plea&s;ure, and di&s;tance, that it cau&s;ed between them and the King's Council (who thought the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords might as rea&s;onably move the King, that They might be remov'd, who lay under the &s;ame brand, and reproaches in <HI>England</HI> for adhering to the Crown, as the other did in <HI>Scotland)</HI> the King had rea&s;on to be troubled with another apprehen&s;ion, which was, that the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> (who could not be ignorant of any thing which the other Per&s;ons &s;aid or did) would, out of ju&s;t indignation, take re|venge <MILESTONE N="30"> upon tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom he contemn'd too much; and &s;o that the Peace of the Country, where his Maje&s;ty was but a Gue&s;t, would be violated by his Subjects, as it were in his own &s;ight; which would make his ab&s;ence from thence the more de&s;irable.</P>
<P>HE, to whom this unrea&s;onable Animo&s;ity was mo&s;t imputed, and who indeed was the great fomenter, and Pro&s;ecutor of it, was the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale;</HI> who&s;e fiery Spirit was not capable of any moderation. One of the Council conferring one day with him upon a Subject that could not put him into pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o being in a very fair conver&s;ation, de&s;ir'd him <Q>&startq;to inform him, what foul Offence the Marquis of <HI>Mon|tro&s;e</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> had ever committed, that &s;hould hinder tho&s;e to make a conjun|ction with him, who, in re&s;pect of the Rebels, were in as de&s;perate a condition as him&s;elf, and who could not more de&s;ire the King's re|&s;titution&endq; than he did.</Q> The Earl told him calmly enough, <Q>&startq;that he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Earl of</HI> Lau|therdale<HI>'s di&s;|cour&s;e again&s;t</HI> Mountro&s;e&punc;</NOTE> could not imagine, or conceive the barbarities and inhumanities <HI>Moun|tro&s;e</HI> was guilty of, in the time he made a War in <HI>Scotland;</HI> that he never gave Quarter to any Man, but pur&s;ued all the Advantages he ever got, with the utmo&s;t outrage and cruelty: that he had in one Battle kill'd fifteen hundred of one family, of the <HI>Campbels,</HI> of the blood and name of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and that he had utterly rooted out &s;everal&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> Names, and entire noble Families.</Q> The other told him, <Q>&startq;that it was the nature and condition of that War, that Quarter was given on nei|ther &s;ide; that tho&s;e Pri&s;oners which were taken by the <HI>Scots,</HI> as once

they did take &s;ome Per&s;ons of honour of his Party, were afterwards in cold blood hang'd reproachfully, which was much wor&s;e than if&endq; they had been kill'd in the field;</Q> and ask'd him, <Q>&startq;if <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> had ever cau&s;ed any Man to dye in cold blood, or after the Battle was ended; &s;ince what was done in it <HI>flagrante,</HI> was more to be imputed&endq; to the fiercene&s;s of his Soldiers, than to his want of humanity.</Q> The Earl confe&s;s'd, <Q>&startq;that he did not know he was guilty of any thing but&endq; what was done in the field;</Q> but concluded with more pa&s;&s;ion, <Q>&startq;that his behaviour there was &s;o &s;avage, that <HI>Scotland</HI> would never forgive&endq; him.</Q> And in other Company, where the &s;ame Subject was debated, <MILESTONE N="10"> he &s;wore with great pa&s;&s;ion, <Q>&startq;that though he wi&s;h'd nothing more in this world than to &s;ee the King re&s;tor'd, he had much rather that he &s;hould never be re&s;tor'd, than that <HI>James Graham</HI> &s;hould be permitted&endq; to come into the Court: of which Declaration of his the King was in|form'd by <HI>William Legg</HI> and S^r <HI>William Armorer,</HI> who were both pre&s;ent at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and in the Company, when he &s;aid it.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was at that time in the <HI>Hague</HI> the Lord <HI>Newburgh,</HI> who, after the Murther of the late King, was compell'd together with his Wife, the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> to fly out of <HI>England, Cromwell</HI> every day making di&s;coveries of corre&s;pondencies which had been between the <MILESTONE N="$$"> King and them. And thereupon they made an e&s;cape from thence, and came to the <HI>Hague.</HI> That Lord having been too young to have had a part in the former War, had been then &s;ent, by his Maje&s;tie's direction, to be bred in <HI>France;</HI> from whence he return'd not till his Maje&s;ty was in the hands of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; and from that time he perform'd all the Offices of fidelity, and duty to the King, that a generous and wor|thy Per&s;on could find any opportunity for: with which his Maje&s;ty was abundantly &s;atisfied and plea&s;ed: and he now tran&s;ported him&s;elf and his Wife into <HI>Holland,</HI> that he might leave her there, and him&s;elf attend the King in any Expedition. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THIS Lady was a Woman of a very great Wit, and mo&s;t tru&s;ted and conver&s;ant in tho&s;e Intrigues, which at that time could be be&s;t ma|nag'd and carried on by Ladies, who with le&s;s jealou&s;y could be &s;een in all Companies: and &s;o &s;he had not been a &s;tranger to the mo&s;t &s;ecret tran&s;actions with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and had much conver&s;ation with the Lord <HI>Lanrick,</HI> during the time the King was at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and whil&s;t he &s;tay'd afterwards in <HI>London,</HI> when the King was impri&s;on'd in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> and being now both in the <HI>Hague,</HI> they had much conver|&s;ation together. She had likewi&s;e had long acquaintance, and friend|&s;hip with one of the Council, who, &s;he knew, had been as much tru&s;ted <MILESTONE N="40"> as any by the Father, and was believ'd to have credit with the pre&s;ent King. She lamented tho&s;e Divi&s;ions among&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> which every Body &s;poke of, and every Body knew the di&s;order they produc'd in the King's Councils; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&s;he de&s;ir'd nothing more, than that there&endq; were a good under&s;tanding between Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and Him;</Q> which, &s;he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&s;he was &s;ure would ea&s;ily be, if they two had but once a&endq; frank conference together.</Q> The other, who indeed had an e&s;teem for the Duke, &s;eem'd very de&s;irous of it: and &s;he thereupon told him, that <Q>&startq;the Duke had expre&s;s'd to her, that he would be willing to embrace&endq; the occa&s;ion: and it was &s;o concerted, that within a day or two, they <MILESTONE N="50"> met as by chance at her Lodgings.</Q> And &s;he &s;o dextrou&s;ly introduc'd them to a civility towards each other, and to expre&s;s their Inclinations to a mutual freedom, that after an hours general conver&s;ation there,
<PB N="227" REF="2450">
to which &s;he left them, and went her &s;elf abroad, they parted with fair profe&s;&s;ions of future good Will; and the other promi&s;ed to vi&s;it the Duke the next morning early, that they might have the more time without being interrupted, and he was with him accordingly, and found him in his bed. They continued together near two hours, the Duke having commanded his Servant to tell any who came to vi&s;it him, that he was a&s;leep. <Q>The other, &s;poke of &startq;the Proclamation, and the man|ner <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conference be|tween Duke</HI> Hamilton <HI>and an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Privy Coun|&s;ellor concern|ing the Af|fairs of</HI> Scot|land.</NOTE> of inviting the King into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the &s;trange &s;pirit that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e who govern'd there, and per&s;waded them to imagine it po&s;&s;ible, that the King could ever be prevailed with to take the Co|venant, <MILESTONE N="10"> or that it could be of Advantage to him to do &s;o; &s;ince it could not but much alienate the Affections of all that Party in <HI>England</HI> that had &s;erv'd his Father, upon whom he ought chiefly to depend&endq; for his Re&s;toration to the Government of that Kingdom.</Q> Then he &s;poke of <Q>&startq;the differences and jealou&s;ies which were between tho&s;e of that Nation who had an equal de&s;ire to &s;erve the King, and &s;eem'd to be equally pro&s;ecuted by the Party that now prevailed, which had&endq; excluded both;</Q> and wi&s;h'd <Q>&startq;that &s;ome Expedient might be found out to unite all tho&s;e; and particularly that his Grace and the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> might be reconciled; towards which, he &s;aid, he was &s;ure <MILESTONE N="20"> that the Marquis had great inclination, and had allways e&s;teem'd him a Man of honour; which appear'd by the book which was publi&s;h'd, where he was allways worthily mention'd, though he had not dealt &s;o&endq; well with many others.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Duke had heard him with very civil attention, he told him as to the fir&s;t part, <Q>&startq;concerning the Proclamation, and the man|ner of inviting the King to come to them, he was not to make any other judgement by it, than only of the Per&s;on of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle;</HI> who, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome few Mini&s;ters, and others his Creatures, did at pre&s;ent govern: that <HI>Argyle</HI> well knew there <MILESTONE N="30"> was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, in re&s;pect of the whole People, to proclaim the King after the murther of his Father; and therefore he could find no other way to keep him from coming thither, but by clogging the Proclamation and Me&s;&s;age with tho&s;e unworthy Expre&s;&s;ions, which might deter him from putting him&s;elf into their hands; which <HI>Ar|gyle</HI> did not wi&s;h he &s;hould do, becau&s;e in his ab&s;ence he was &s;ure he &s;hould govern all, being well agreed with <HI>Cromwell</HI> how the Govern|ment &s;hould be carried; and &s;o the King might be kept out, <HI>Crom|well</HI> would &s;upport him again&s;t all other Parties; but that they both knew well enough, that if his Maje&s;ty were once there, the whole&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> Nation would &s;tick to him and obey him.</Q> <Q>He confe&s;s'd, &startq;that there was generally &s;o great a &s;uper&s;tition for the Covenant, that who&s;o|ever &s;hould &s;peak again&s;t it for the pre&s;ent, would lo&s;e all credit, though he did acknowledge it had done much mi&s;chief, and would do&endq; more whil&s;t it &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted upon;</Q> but, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that mu&s;t be a work of time, and an effect of the King's Government; which would find it nece&s;&s;ary, in many other re&s;pects, to le&s;&s;en the power of the Mini&s;ters; which being le&s;&s;en'd, the reverence of the Covenant would quickly fall too; and till then He, and all Men, mu&s;t have patience.&endq;</Q> <Q>For the &s;econd, he &s;aid, &startq;he wi&s;h'd heartily that there could be a <MILESTONE N="50"> union of all Parties which de&s;ired the King's Re&s;toration, and that the Animo&s;ity again&s;t the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> might be extingui&s;hed. For his own part, that he had only one quarrel again&s;t him, which
<PB N="228" REF="2460">
was that, by his unju&s;t calumnies and pro&s;ecution, he had driven him into Rebellion; which nothing el&s;e could have done. And for that he allways asked God forgivene&s;s from his heart, and de&s;ired nothing more than to repair his fault by lo&s;ing his life for the King; and would, with all his heart, joyn to morrow with the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> in carrying on the King's Service, though he did believe, in that con|juncture, the animo&s;ity again&s;t the Marquis was &s;o great, that if he &s;hould declare &s;uch an inclination, all his own Friends would fall from&endq; him, and abhor him.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;his own condition was very hard; for that having been allways bred up in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for <MILESTONE N="10"> which he had a great reverence, he was forced to comply with the Covenant; which he perfectly dete&s;ted, and looked upon it as the ruin of his Nation; and would be as glad as any Man of a good opportu|nity&endq; to declare again&s;t it.</Q> <Q>But, &s;aid he, &startq;I dare not &s;ay this; and if&endq; I did, I &s;hould have no power or credit to &s;erve the King.</Q> <Q>There is, &s;aid he, &startq;a very worthy Gentleman, who lodges in this Hou&s;e, the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> my Friend and my Kin&s;man; who, upon my Con|&s;cience, loves me heartily; and yet I dare &s;ay nothing of this to him, either Again&s;t the Covenant, or For the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e:</HI> and, if I &s;hould, I believe he would rather choo&s;e to kill me, than to joyn <MILESTONE N="20"> with me: &s;o much he is tran&s;ported with prejudice in both the&s;e par|ticulars, and &s;o incapable to hear rea&s;on upon either of tho&s;e Argu|ments, though, in all other things, few men have a better Under&s;tand|ing,&endq; or can di&s;cour&s;e more rea&s;onably.</Q></P>
<P>WHILST they continued in all po&s;&s;ible freedom in this conference, the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who it &s;eems was inform'd of the other's be|ing there, came in his Night-Gown into the Chamber, and &s;o broke off the di&s;cour&s;e. The other, after &s;itting &s;ome time in general Conver&s;a|tion, departed. And there continued afterwards all civility between the Duke and him. <Q>But as him&s;elf told the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> who &s;hortly <MILESTONE N="30"> after died there, &startq;he could not, without giving jealou&s;y to his Friend <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> which he had no mind to do, &s;pend &s;o much time with&endq; the other in private as he could have been willing to have done: and the death of that Lady le&s;&s;en'd the opportunities.</Q></P>
<P>IN this un&s;teady and irre&s;olute condition of the King's Council, it was very manife&s;t, that, how long &s;oever his Maje&s;ty &s;hould defer the re&s;olution, to what place he would remove, he &s;hould not be able to &s;tay long in the place were he was. The States, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> let fall &s;omewhat every day in their Councils, and Con&s;ultations, <Q>&startq;that the King's re&s;iding in the <HI>Hague</HI> would be very inconvenient to&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> them;</Q> and it was the great Intere&s;t of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> not without much dexterity, that kept the States from &s;ending a Me&s;&s;age directly to his Maje&s;ty, to de&s;ire him, <Q>&startq;that he would depart from that&endq; Country, a&s;&s;oon as he could.</Q> And there happen'd an Accident at this time, which made the re&s;olution nece&s;&s;ary, and would inevitably have drawn on that Me&s;&s;age, which had yet been kept back.</P>
<P>IT was touched before, that there was a purpo&s;e at <HI>London,</HI> to &s;end over an Envoy from thence into <HI>Holland,</HI> to prepare the way for a far|ther good Intelligence, and Negotiation, which might end in a firm Peace, and a reciprocal Alliance between the two Republicks. To that <MILESTONE N="50"> purpo&s;e one <HI>Dori&s;laus,</HI> a D^r in the Civil Law, was named; who, being born in <HI>Delphi</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> had been bred at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and afterwards liv'd long in <HI>London,</HI> having been receiv'd into <HI>Gre&s;ham</HI> College as a

Profe&s;&s;or in one of tho&s;e Chairs which are endow'd for publick Lectures in that Society, and had been, from the beginning of the troubles, in the Exerci&s;e of the Judge Advocate's Office in the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Ar|my. In this conjuncture this Man arriv'd at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and took his Lodging in a Hou&s;e where &s;trangers u&s;ed to repair, and were accom|modated till they provided otherwi&s;e for their better accommodation. Whil&s;t he was at Supper, the &s;ame Evening that he came to the Town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dori&s;laus, <HI>an Agent of the Parliament, $$lled at the</HI> Hague <HI>by &s;o$e</HI> Scoti&s;h <HI>$$en.</HI></NOTE> in Company of many others who u&s;ed to eat there, half a do$en Gen|tlemen enter'd the room with their Swords drawn, and required tho&s;e who were at the Table <Q>&startq;not to &s;tir; for that there was no harm intended <MILESTONE N="10"> to any but the Agent who came from the Rebels in <HI>England,</HI> who&endq; had newly murther'd their King.</Q> And one of them, who knew <HI>Do|ri&s;laus,</HI> pulled him from the Table, and killed him at his feet: and there|upon they all put up their Swords, and walked lei&s;urely out of the Hou&s;e, leaving tho&s;e who were in the room, in much amazement and con&s;ternation. Though all who were engaged in the Enterpri&s;e, went quietly away, and &s;o out of the Town, in&s;omuch as no one of them was ever apprehended, or called in Que&s;tion, yet they kept not their own coun&s;el &s;o well (believing they had done a very Heroick act) but that it was generally known they were all <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Men, and mo&s;t of <MILESTONE N="20"> them Servants, or Dependents upon the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THE King was exceedingly troubled and perplexed with this Acci|dent, which he could not fore&s;ee, and ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd that it would be applied to his prejudice; and that the States could not but highly re|&s;ent it, in many re&s;pects; that the Man who was killed, was in truth their own Subject, and imployed to them, as a publick Mini&s;ter&punc; by tho&s;e with whom they had no mind to have any Quarrel. Upon all which his Maje&s;ty concluded, that his pre&s;ence there, would quickly appear more unacceptable than ever: be&s;ides, that there had been the &s;ame night &s;ome quarrels, and fighting in the Streets between &s;ome <MILESTONE N="30"> Servants of the King, and &s;ome Gentlemen of the Town; in which a Son of one of the States was dangerou&s;ly hurt, though he recover'd afterwards.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied but that the States proceeded upon the&s;e di&s;or|ders, to which they had not been accu&s;tom'd, with great gravity, and more than ordinary re&s;pect to the King. They were highly offended with what was pa&s;t, and &s;en&s;ible what expo&s;tulations, and clamour for Ju&s;tice they mu&s;t expect, and &s;u&s;tain from <HI>England,</HI> and what reproaches they mu&s;t undergo for &s;uffering all tho&s;e who had been guilty of &s;uch a Crime, to e&s;cape the Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice; which could not but be im|puted <MILESTONE N="40"> to them, as a great &s;candal to their Government: Yet they pro|ceeded very &s;lowly in their Inqui&s;ition, and with &s;uch formalities as were u&s;ual (and which could bring no prejudice to the Offenders; who were either gone out of their Dominions, or concealed them&s;elves in other Towns, where the &s;ame formalities were to be u&s;ed, if they were di&s;cover'd) and without &s;o much reflection upon the King, as if they believ'd that the guilty Per&s;ons had any relation to his Service: yet they took notice of <Q>&startq;the Multitude of Strangers which were in the Town, and how impo&s;&s;ible it would be for them to pre&s;erve the Peace,&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> and good Government thereof, if &s;uch re&s;ort were not re&s;train'd.</Q> They aggravated exceedingly <Q>&startq;the indignity that had been offer'd to the State it &s;elf, in the attempt that had been made upon a Per&s;on under Their Protection, and for who&s;e &s;afety the Publick &s;aith was, upon the&endq;

<P>THE King was receiv'd in the &s;ame manner he had been formerly, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King gives a vi&s;it to the States of</HI> Holland, <HI>and delivers them a Memo|rial.</HI></NOTE> and being conducted into the room of Council, after a &s;hort Comple|ment, he deliver'd a Paper to them, which he de&s;ir'd might be read, and that he might receive their advice thereupon a&s;&s;oon as they pleas'd. The Memorial contain'd, in the fir&s;t place, his Maje&s;tie's acknowledge|ment of the civilities he had receiv'd there, and his de&s;ire <Q>&startq;that by&endq; them the States General</Q> (who were not at that time a&s;&s;embled) <Q>&startq;might <MILESTONE N="$$"> be inform'd of &s;uch his Maje&s;tie's &s;en&s;e of their kindne&s;s; e&s;pecially in the full and high dete&s;tation they had expre&s;s'd of the impious, and unparallel'd Murther of his Royal Father, of Ble&s;&s;ed Memo|ry, their fa&s;t and un&s;haken Ally, by which the Forms and Rules of all kind of Government were no le&s;s violated and di&s;&s;olv'd, than that of Monarchy: that he came to inform them that he did in|tend, in a &s;hort time, &s;o to di&s;po&s;e of his Per&s;on, as might with God's ble&s;&s;ing mo&s;t probably advance his Affairs; and that for the better doing thereof, and that he might in &s;o important an Affair receive their particular advice, he &s;hould impart to them the true <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;tate and condition of his &s;everal Dominions.

<P>THIS being the true pre&s;ent condition of his two Kingdoms of <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and it being nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty, to give life to the afflicted &s;tate of his affairs by his own Per&s;onal activity and vi|gour, he told them, <Q>&startq;there remain'd only, that he &s;hould impart to them the like State of his other Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> which had like|wi&s;e &s;ent to him, and de&s;ir'd him to repair thither with great impor|tunity: that the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> his Lieutenant there, had con|cluded a Peace with the Roman Catholicks; and that thereby his Ma|je&s;ty was entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of three parts of four of that his large and fruitful Kingdom, and of the Command of good Armies, and of many <MILESTONE N="40"> good Ships to be joyn'd to his own Fleet; and that he had rea&s;on to hope and to believe that <HI>Dublin</HI> it &s;elf, and the few other places, which had &s;ubmitted to the Rebellious power in <HI>England,</HI> either already were, upon the knowledge of that odious Parricide, return'd to their allegiance, or would &s;peed$ly be reduc'd; of which he expected every day to receive adverti&s;ement; which if it &s;hould fall out, yet he &s;ore|&s;aw many objections might be made again&s;t his going thither, not only in regard of the difficulty and danger of his pa&s;&s;age, but of the jealou&s;ies which would ari&s;e upon the large conce&s;&s;ions which were made unto the Roman Catholicks of that Kingdom; which could not&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> be avoided.</Q> And having thus given them a clear Information of the State of his three Kingdoms, his Maje&s;ty concluded with his de&s;ire, <Q>&startq;that the States would give him their advice as freely, to which of

them he &s;hould repair; and that they would give him all nece&s;&s;ary&endq; a&s;&s;i&s;tance that he might pro&s;ecute their coun&s;el.</Q></P>
<P>MANY Men fear'd, that the King would have brought great preju|dice to him&s;elf by this Communication, and, upon the matter, oblig'd him&s;elf to follow their advice; which they apprehended would be con|trary to his own judgement. For nothing was more commonly di&s;|cours'd among the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and by many of the States them&s;elves, than <Q>&startq;that the King ought, without delay, to throw him&s;elf into the Arms of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to gratify them in all they de&s;ir'd: that Bi&s;hops were not worth the contending for; and that the &s;upporting Them, had <MILESTONE N="$$"> been the ruin of his Father, and would be His, if he continu'd in the&endq; &s;ame ob&s;tinacy.</Q> But the King had rea&s;on to believe that they would not &s;o much concern them&s;elves in his broken Affairs, as to give him advice what to do: and it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to get a little more time, upon &s;ome occurrences which would every day happen, before he took a po&s;itive re&s;olution which way to &s;teer: for though, in his own opinion, <HI>Ireland</HI> was the place to which he was to repair, yet he knew that notwith&s;tanding the Peace that was made, there were &s;e|veral Parties &s;till in Arms there, be&s;ides tho&s;e who adher'd to the Par|liament, who refus'd to &s;ubmit to that Peace. Though the general <MILESTONE N="$$"> Council at <HI>Kilkenny</HI> (which had been allways look'd upon as the Re|pre&s;entative of the Confederate Catholicks of that Kingdom, and to which they had allways &s;ubmitted) had fully con&s;ented to the Treaty of Peace with the Lord Lieutenant, yet <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> who had the Command of all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> and who was look'd upon as the be&s;t General they had, totally refus'd to &s;ubmit to it, and po&s;itively prote&s;ted again&s;t it, as not having provided for their Intere&s;t; and that Council was not &s;orry for his &s;eparation, there being little le&s;s animo|&s;ity between tho&s;e of <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> and the other <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> than was between them both and the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> and they knew that <HI>O Neile</HI> more in&s;i&s;ted upon <MILESTONE N="$$"> recompence in Lands and Preferments, than upon any provi&s;ion that concern'd Religion it &s;elf. Then the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> who were very numerous, and under good di&s;cipline, and well provided with Arms and Ammunition, would not &s;ubmit to the Commands of the Lord Lieutenant; but were re&s;olv'd to follow the Example of their Country|men, and to &s;ee the King admitted and receiv'd, as well as proclaim'd, before they would &s;ubmit to his Authority: which made the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> the le&s;s troubled at the Ob&s;tinacy of <HI>O Neile</HI> (though he had u&s;ed all the means he had to draw him in) &s;ince he pre&s;umed the <HI>Scots</HI> and He would mortify each other, during the time that he &s;hould &s;pend <MILESTONE N="40"> in making him&s;elf &s;trong enough to &s;uppre&s;s them both: For the <HI>Scots,</HI> who would not joyn with the Marquis, were very vigorous in pro&s;e|cuting the War again&s;t <HI>O Neile,</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> of <HI>Ul&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e Divi&s;ions, Factions, and Confu&s;ions in <HI>Ireland,</HI> made the King the more &s;ollicitous that his Council &s;hould be unanimous for his going thither, at lea&s;t that the <HI>Scots,</HI> how virulent &s;oever again&s;t each other, &s;hould all concur in their Advice, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was not yet &s;ea&s;onable for him to go for <HI>Scotland;</HI></Q> which made him labour &s;o much to bring the <HI>Hamiltonians,</HI> and tho&s;e who follow'd <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> whom he believ'd both to be of that opinion, to meet together, and to own it joyntly to the King in Council: but it <MILESTONE N="50"> is &s;aid before how impo&s;&s;ible it was to obtain that Conjunction.</P>
<P>WHEN the King &s;ound, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to bring the Lords of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation together to confer upon the Affairs of that King|dom,
<PB N="233" REF="2510">
he thought to have drawn them &s;everally, that is, tho&s;e of the <HI>Engagement</HI> by them&s;elves, and the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> with His Friends by them&s;elves, to have given him their Advice in the pre&s;ence of his Council, that &s;o, upon debate thereof between them, his Maje&s;ty might the more maturely have determin'd what he was to do. The Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> expre&s;s'd a great willingne&s;s to give his Maje&s;ty &s;atisfaction this, or any other way, being willing to deliver his opinion concerning things, or Per&s;ons, before any Body, and in any place. But the Lords of the <HI>Engagement</HI> po&s;itively refus'd to deliver their opinion, but to the King him&s;elf, and not in the pre&s;ence of his Council; which, <MILESTONE N="10"> they &s;aid, <Q>&startq;would be to confe&s;s a kind of &s;ubordination of the Kingdom&endq; of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was independent on the Council of <HI>England;</HI></Q> and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> told the Coun&s;ellor, with whom he had before &s;o freely conver&s;ed, and who expo&s;tulated with him upon it, <Q>&startq;that it was the only ground of the heavy judgement in Parliament again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Traquair,</HI> that, having been the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he gave account to the King of tran&s;actions, and of the affairs of that Kingdom, at the Council Table in <HI>England;</HI> whereof he was likewi&s;e a Member; &s;o jealous that Kingdom was, and &s;till is, of their Native&endq; Privileges;</Q> and therefore de&s;ir'd, <Q>&startq;that he might not be pre&s;&s;ed to&endq; do what had been &s;o penal to another in his own &s;ight.</Q></P>
<P>THE King &s;atisfied him&s;elf with having all their opinions deliver'd to him&s;elf, &s;ub&s;crib'd under all their hands, which every one con&s;ented to: though mo&s;t of them would have been glad that the King would have gone into <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon what conde&s;cen&s;ions &s;oever; becau&s;e they all believ'd His pre&s;ence would ea&s;ily turn all, and that they &s;hould be quickly re&s;tor'd to their E&s;tates, which they cared mo&s;t for; yet no body pre&s;um'd to give that advice, or &s;eem'd to think it &s;ea&s;onable. So that the King re&s;um'd the former Debate of going directly for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and direction was given for providing Ships, and all other things ne|ce&s;&s;ary <MILESTONE N="30"> for that Voyage. There remain'd only one doubt, whether his Maje&s;ty &s;hould take <HI>France</HI> in his way, that he might &s;ee his Mother, who by Letters and Me&s;&s;ages pre&s;&s;ed him very earne&s;tly &s;o to do; or whether he &s;hould imbark in <HI>Holland</HI> directly for <HI>Ireland;</HI> which would be le&s;s lo&s;s of time, and might be done early in the Spring, before the Parliament's Fleet &s;hould put out to Sea.</P>
<P>THEY who did not wi&s;h that the Queen &s;hould exerci&s;e any power over the King, or have too much credit with him, were again&s;t his going into <HI>France,</HI> as <Q>&startq;an occa&s;ion of &s;pending more time than his Af|fairs would permit, and an obligation to make a greater Expence than&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> he had, or knew where to have, means to defray:</Q> and they thought it an Argument of moment, <Q>&startq;that from the time of the Murther of his Father, the King had never receiv'd Letter of condolement from&endq; <HI>France,</HI> nor the lea&s;t invitation to go thither.</Q> On the other &s;ide, they who wi&s;h'd, and hop'd that the Queen would have &s;uch an influence upon the King that his Council &s;hould have le&s;s credit with him, de&s;ir'd very much that his Maje&s;ty would make <HI>France</HI> his way. The <HI>Scots</HI> de&s;ir'd it very much, believing they &s;hould find her Maje&s;ty very propitious to their coun&s;els, and inclin'd to tru&s;t their undertakings; and they were very &s;ure that <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> would never go to <HI>Paris,</HI> or have credit <MILESTONE N="50"> with the Queen.</P>
<P>THE Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Prince&s;s Royal his Wife, had a great de&s;ire to gratify the Queen, and that the King &s;hould &s;ee her in the way;
<PB N="234" REF="2520">
and propos'd <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty might appoint a place, where the Queen and He might meet, without going to <HI>Paris;</HI> and, after three or four days &s;tay together, his Maje&s;ty might ha&s;ten his Journey to &s;ome con|venient Port, from whence he might imbark for <HI>Ireland</HI> by a &s;horter pa&s;&s;age than from <HI>Holland;</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would appoint two Ships of War, to attend his Maje&s;ty in that <HI>French</HI> Port, before&endq; he &s;hould get thither.</Q> His Maje&s;ty inclin'd this way, without po&s;i|tively re&s;olving upon it; yet directed <Q>&startq;that his own Goods of bulk, and his inferior Servants, &s;hould be pre&s;ently imbark'd to take the di|recte&s;t&endq; pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Ireland;</HI></Q> and order'd <Q>&startq;that the re&s;t, who were to <MILESTONE N="10"> wait upon his Per&s;on, &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;end their Goods and Baggage, and &s;uch Servants who were not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their pre&s;ent&endq; Service, upon the &s;ame Ships for <HI>Ireland;</HI></Q> declaring, <Q>&startq;that, if he made <HI>France</HI> his way, he would make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t, and go with as light&endq; a train as he could.</Q> Hereupon two Ships were &s;hortly after provided, and many Per&s;ons (and great &s;tore of Baggage) imbark'd for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and arriv'd there in &s;afety; but mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons, and all the Goods, mi&s;carried in their return, when they knew that the King was not to come thither, upon the accidents that afterwards fell out there.</P>
<P>THIS Re&s;olution being taken, the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> who had a ju&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> excu&s;e from his Age, being then &s;eventy five years old, to wi&s;h to be in &s;ome repo&s;e, con&s;ider'd with him&s;elf how to become di&s;intangled from the fatigue of tho&s;e Voyages and Journies, which he &s;aw the King would be oblig'd to make. In <HI>Holland</HI> he had no mind to &s;tay, having never lov'd that People, nor been lov'd by them; and he thought the Climate it &s;elf was very pernicious to his health, by rea&s;on of the Gout, which frequently vi&s;ited him. <HI>France</HI> was as ungrateful to him, where he had not been kindly treated, and was look'd upon as one who had been allways addicted to <HI>Spain,</HI> and no friend to the Crown of <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that he was willing to find a good occa&s;ion to &s;pend the remainder <MILESTONE N="30"> of his age where he had &s;pent &s;o much of his youth, in <HI>Spain,</HI> and where he believ'd that he might be able to do the King more &s;ervice than any other way. And there was newly come to the <HI>Hague</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gen|tleman, who had been an Officer in the King's Army, and was in <HI>Ma|drid</HI> when the News came thither of the Murther of the King: and he related many particulars of the pa&s;&s;ion and indignation of that Court, upon that occa&s;ion, again&s;t the Rebels; that <Q>&startq;the King, and all the&endq; Court,</Q> put them&s;elves into &s;olemn mourning: (and he repeated &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which the King, and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> had made of ten|derne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion for our King) and that <Q>&startq;the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;poke&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> of &s;ending an Emba&s;&s;adour to his Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>THESE relations, and any thing of that kind, how weakly &s;oever founded, were very willingly heard.

not more asked of him than could con&s;i&s;t with his Affairs to &s;pare, a good yearly &s;upport might be procured There, and the expectation&endq; of it might be worth the King's &s;ending an Emba&s;&s;adour thither.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he was more of that opinion &s;ince the King had taken the re&s;o|lution of going for <HI>Ireland;</HI> where the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s credit might be of great benefit to him: that <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and the old <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> of <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> were &s;till in Armes again&s;t the King; and would not &s;ubmit to the conditions which the general Council of the Confederate Ca|tholicks had con&s;ented to with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond:</HI> that <HI>O Neile</HI> had been bred in <HI>Spain,</HI> and had a Regiment in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and &s;o mu&s;t <MILESTONE N="10"> have an ab&s;olute dependence upon his Catholick Maje&s;ty, for whom all the old <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had ever had a particular devotion; and if it were only to di&s;po&s;e Him and that People to the King's obedience, and to accept tho&s;e conditions which might conveniently be given to them, it were well worth &s;uch a Journey; and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would ne|ver refu&s;e to gratify the King to the utmo&s;t that could be de&s;ired in&endq; that particular.</Q> The Chancellor thought this di&s;cour&s;e not unrea&s;on|able, and asked him, <Q>&startq;&endq;who would be fit to be &s;ent thither?</Q> not imagin|ing that he had any thought of going thither Him&s;elf.

<P>THE Chancellor was weary of the Company he was in, and the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which, having no pro&s;pect but towards de&s;pair, was yet render'd more grievous by the continual Contentions and Animo&s;ities between Per&s;ons. He knew he was not in the Queen's &s;avour at all, and &s;hould find no re&s;pect in that Court. However, he was very &s;crupulous, that the King might not &s;u&s;pect that he was weary of his Attendance, or that any Body el&s;e might believe that he withdrew him&s;elf from wait|ing longer upon &s;o de&s;perate a Fortune. <Q>In the end, he told the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> &startq;that he would only be pa&s;&s;ive in the point, and refer it <MILESTONE N="30"> entirely to Him, if he thought fit to di&s;po&s;e the King to like it; and if the King approv'd it &s;o much as to take notice of it to the Chancel|lor, and commend it as a thing he thought for his Service, he would&endq; &s;ubmit to his Command.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Cottington</HI>'s heart was much &s;et upon this imployment, and he managed &s;o warily with the King, and pre&s;ented the whole &s;cheme to him &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that his Maje&s;ty was much plea&s;ed with it; and &s;hortly after declared his re&s;olution publickly, <Q>&startq;to &s;end the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de|clares tho&s;e t$o to be his Emba&s;&s;adours.</NOTE> <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, his Emba&s;&s;adours&endq; extraordinary into <HI>Spain;</HI></Q> and commanded them <Q>&startq;to prepare their <MILESTONE N="40"> own Commi&s;&s;ion, and In&s;tructions; and to begin their Journey a&s;&s;oon&endq; as was po&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>BEFORE the King could begin his own Journey for <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Maje&s;ty thought it nece&s;&s;ary, upon the whole pro&s;pect of his Affairs with reference to all places, to put his bu&s;ine&s;s into as good a method as he could, and to di&s;po&s;e of that number of Officers, and Soldiers, and other Per&s;ons, who had pre&s;ented them&s;elves to be applied to his Service, or to leave them to take the be&s;t cour&s;e they could for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Of the&s;e, many were &s;ent into <HI>Ireland</HI> with the Ships which carried the King's Goods, with recommendation <MILESTONE N="50"> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>&startq;to put them into his Army till the King&endq; came thither.</Q> Since the <HI>Scots</HI> were no better di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve, or receive the King for the pre&s;ent, his Maje&s;ty was re&s;olv'd to give the

Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> all the encouragement he de&s;ired to vi&s;it them, and to incline them to a better temper.</P>
<P>THERE was then at the <HI>Hague Cornificius Wolfelte,</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour extraordinary from the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> to the States General; who came with a great Train and great State, and was him&s;elf a Man of va|nity and o&s;tentation, and took pains to be thought &s;o great a Man by his own Intere&s;t, that he did not enough extol the power of his Ma&s;ter; which prov'd his ruin after his return. He had left <HI>Denmark</HI> before the news came thither of the Murther of the King, and &s;o he had no Credentials for his Maje&s;ty, by rea&s;on whereof he could not receive any <MILESTONE N="10"> publick formal Audience; <Q>but de&s;ired &startq;the King's leave that he might, as by accident, be admitted to &s;peak to him at the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI>'s&endq; Court; where his Maje&s;ty u&s;ed to be every day;</Q> and there the Em|ba&s;&s;adour often &s;poke to him. The Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> had found means to endear him&s;elf much to this Emba&s;&s;adour, who gave him encouragement to hope for a very good reception in <HI>Denmark,</HI> if the King would &s;end him thither, and that he might obtain Armes, and Ammunition there for <HI>Scotland.</HI> <Q>The Emba&s;&s;adour told him, &startq;that, if the King would write a Letter to him to that purpo&s;e, he would pre&s;ently &s;upply him with &s;ome Money and Armes, in a&s;&s;urance that&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> his Ma&s;ter would very well approve of what he &s;hould do.</Q> The Mar|quis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> well knew, that the King was not able to &s;upply him with the lea&s;t proportion of Money to begin his Journey; and therefore he had only propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that the King would give him Letters, in the form he pre&s;cribed, to &s;everal Princes in <HI>Germany,</HI> who&s;e affections&endq; he pretended to know;</Q> which Letters he &s;ent by &s;everal Officers, who were to bring the Soldiers or Armes they &s;hould obtain, to a Rendez|vous he appointed near <HI>Hamburg;</HI> and re&s;olv'd him&s;elf to go into <HI>Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> in hope to get &s;upplies in both tho&s;e places, both from the Crowns, and by the contribution of many <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Officers, <MILESTONE N="$$"> who had Command and E&s;tates in tho&s;e Countries; and to have Cre|dentials, by virtue of which he might appear Emba&s;&s;adour extraordi|nary from the King, if he &s;hould find it expedient; though he did in|tend rather to negotiate his bu&s;ine&s;s in private, and without any pub|lick Character. All this was re&s;olv'd before his confidence, at lea&s;t his familiarity with the Emba&s;&s;adour, was grown le&s;s. <Q>But, upon the En|couragement he had from him, he moved the King &startq;for his Letter to the Emba&s;&s;adour, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> with his Advice, and with his Intere&s;t in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and in any other Court, to the end that he might obtain the Loan of Monies, Armes, and Ammunition, <MILESTONE N="40"> and whatever el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to enable the Marquis to pro&s;ecute&endq; his intended De&s;cent into <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> The King, glad that he did not pre&s;s for ready Money, which he was not able to &s;upply him with, gave him &s;uch Letters as he de&s;ired to all Per&s;ons, and particularly to the Emba&s;&s;adour him&s;elf; who, having order from his Ma&s;ter to pre|&s;ent the King with a Sum of Money for his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, never inform'd the King thereof, but advi&s;ed <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> to procure &s;uch a Letter from his Maje&s;ty to him; which being done, the Marquis receiv'd that Money from him, and likewi&s;e &s;ome Armes; with which he be|gun his unfortunate Enterpri&s;e; and pro&s;ecuted his Journey to <HI>Ham|burg;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Mountro&s;e <HI>goes to</HI> Ham|burg.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="$$"> where he expected to meet his <HI>German</HI> Troops, which he be|liev'd the Officers he had &s;ent thither with the King's Letters would be well able to rai&s;e, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e Princes to whom they
<PB N="237" REF="2550">
had been &s;ent. But he was carried on by a &s;tronger a&s;&s;urance he had receiv'd from &s;ome prophecies, and predictions, to which he was na|turally given, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould by his valour recover <HI>Scotland</HI> for the King, and from thence conduct an Army that &s;hould &s;ettle his Ma|je&s;ty&endq; in all his other Dominions.</Q></P>
<P>THERE had been yet nothing done by the King with reference to <HI>England</HI> &s;ince the Murther of his Father; nor did there appear any thing, of any kind, to be attempted as yet there: there was &s;o terrible a con&s;ternation, that &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Spirits of that People, that though Men's Affections were greater, and more general for the King, out of <MILESTONE N="10"> the horror and dete&s;tation they had of the late Parricide, yet the own|ing it was too penal for their broken courage; nor was it believ'd po&s;&s;i|ble for any Man to contribute any thing, at pre&s;ent, for their Deli|verance. However, mo&s;t Men were of opinion, <Q>&startq;that it was nece&s;&s;ary for the King to publi&s;h &s;ome Declaration, that he might not &s;eem utterly to give over his Claim there; and to keep up the Spirits of&endq; his Friends.</Q> And many from <HI>England,</HI> who in the mid&s;t of their de&s;pair would give &s;ome coun&s;el, advi&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that there might be &s;ome|what publi&s;hed by the King that might give &s;ome Check to the ge|neral &s;ubmitting to the <HI>Engagement,</HI> which was &s;o univer&s;ally pre&s;s'd&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> there.</Q> The King being every day adverti&s;ed, how much this was de|&s;ired and expected, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords being of the &s;ame opinion, hoping that &s;omewhat might be in&s;erted in it that might favour the Presbyterians, his Maje&s;ty propo&s;ed at the Council <Q>&startq;that there might be &s;ome draught prepared of a Proclamation, or Declaration, only&endq; with reference to the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI></Q> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had been mo&s;t conver&s;ant in In&s;truments of that na|ture, was appointed to make one ready; though he had declared, <Q>&startq;that he did not know what &s;uch a Declaration could contain, and there|fore&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Ex$$e|que$ $ppoi$t|ed to make $ Declaration relating to</HI> England.</NOTE> that he thought it not &s;ea&s;onable to publi&s;h any.</Q> The Prince of <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Orange</HI> was pre&s;ent at that Council, and whether from his own opinion, or from the &s;ugge&s;tion of the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords, who were much favour'd by him, he wi&s;h'd, <Q>&startq;that, in regard of the great differences which were in <HI>England</HI> about matters of Religion, the King would offer, in this De|claration, to refer all matters in controver&s;y concerning Religion to a National Synod; in which there &s;hould be admitted &s;ome foreign&endq; Divines from the Prote&s;tant Churches;</Q> which, he thought, would be a popular clau&s;e, and might be acceptable abroad as well as at home: and the King believ'd no objection could be made again&s;t it; and &s;o thought fit &s;uch a Clau&s;e &s;hould be in&s;erted. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>WITHIN a &s;hort time after the Council was parted, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;ent for the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and told him, <Q>&startq;he was not enough acquainted with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but de&s;ired him to intreat him not to be too &s;harp in this Declaration, the end whereof was to unite, and reconcile different humours; and that he found many had a great apprehen&s;ion, that the &s;harpne&s;s of His Style would&endq; irritate them much more.</Q> The Chancellor knew well enough that this came from the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and he wi&s;h'd heartily that the charge might be committed to any Body el&s;e, prote&s;ting, <Q>&startq;that he was never le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed in his own conceptions, and reflections, to undertake any <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;uch task in his Life; and that he could not imagine how it was po&s;|&s;ible for the King to publi&s;h a Declaration at that time (his fir&s;t De|claration) without much &s;harpne&s;s again&s;t the Murtherers of his&endq;
<PB N="238" REF="2560">
Father;</Q> which no body could &s;peak again&s;t; nor could he be excu&s;ed from the Work impo&s;ed upon him: and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, <Q>&startq;it was not That kind of &s;harpne&s;s which he wi&s;h'd &s;hould be de|clined:&endq; and though he &s;eem'd not willing farther to explain him&s;elf,</Q> it was evident that he wi&s;h'd that there might not be any &s;harpne&s;s again&s;t the Presbyterians, for which there was at that time no occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE was one particular, which, without a full and di&s;tinct In|&s;truction, the Chancellor could not pre&s;ume to expre&s;s. The great end of this Declaration was to confirm the affection of as many as was po&s;|&s;ible for the King, and, con&s;equently, as few were to be made de&s;perate, <MILESTONE N="10"> as might con&s;i&s;t with the King's Honour, and nece&s;&s;ary Ju&s;tice: &s;o that how far that Clau&s;e, which was e&s;&s;ential to a Declaration upon this &s;ub|ject, concerning the Indemnity of Per&s;ons, &s;hould extend, was the que|&s;tion. And in this there was difference of opinions; the mo&s;t prevalent was, <Q>&startq;that no Per&s;ons &s;hould be excepted from pardon, but only &s;uch who had an immediate hand in the execrable Murther of the King, by being his Judges, and pronouncing that Sentence, and they who&endq; perform'd the Execution.</Q> Others &s;aid, they <Q>&startq;knew that &s;ome were in the Li&s;t of the Judges, and named by the Parliament, who found&endq; Excu&s;es to be ab&s;ent;</Q> and others, that <Q>&startq;&s;ome who were not named, <MILESTONE N="$0"> more contrived and contributed to that odious proceeding, than ma|ny&endq; of the Actors in it.</Q> But the re&s;olution was, that the former &s;hould be only comprehended.</P>
<P>WHEN the Declaration was prepared, and read at the Board, there was a deep &s;ilence, no Man &s;peaking to any part of it. But another day was appointed for a &s;econd reading it, again&s;t which time every Man might be better prepared to &s;peak to it: and in the mean time the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in regard he was not a perfect Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, de&s;ired he might have a Copy of it, that he might the better under&s;tand it. <Q>And the Chancellor of the Exchequer de&s;ired, &startq;that <MILESTONE N="30"> not only the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> might have a Copy, but that his Ma|je&s;ty would likewi&s;e have one, and, after he &s;hould have peru&s;ed it him&s;elf, he would &s;hew it to any other, who he thought was fit to&endq; advi&s;e with;</Q> there being many Lords and other Per&s;ons of Quality about him, who were not of the Council: and he moved, <Q>&startq;that he might have liberty him&s;elf to communicate it to &s;ome who were like to make a judgement, how far any thing of that Nature was like to be&endq; acceptable, and agreeable to the minds of the People;</Q> and named <HI>Herbert</HI> the Atturney General, and D^r <HI>Steward,</HI> who was Dean of the Chapel; and His opinion, in all things relating to the Church, the King <MILESTONE N="40"> had been advi&s;ed by his Father to &s;ubmit to. All which was approv'd by the King; and, for that rea&s;on, a farther day was appointed for the &s;econd reading. The I&s;&s;ue was, that, except two or three of the Coun|cil, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Different opi|nions in the King's Council about it when it was read.</NOTE> who were of one and the &s;ame opinion of the whole, there were not two Per&s;ons who were admitted to the peru&s;al of it, who did not take &s;ome exception to it, though &s;carce two made the &s;ame exception.</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Steward,</HI> though a Man of a very good under&s;tanding, was &s;o exceedingly griev'd at the Clau&s;e of admitting Foreign Divines into a Synod that was to con&s;ult upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that he could not be &s;atisfied by any Arguments that could be given of <Q>&startq;the <MILESTONE N="50"> impo&s;&s;ibility of any effect, or that the Parliament would accept the Overture; and that there could be no danger if it did, becau&s;e the&endq; Number of tho&s;e Foreign Divines mu&s;t be &s;till limited by the King;</Q>
<PB N="239" REF="2570">
but came one morning to the Chancellor, with whom he had a Friend|&s;hip, and prote&s;ted <Q>&startq;he had not &s;lept that Night, out of the agony and trouble, that He, who he knew lov'd the Church &s;o well, &s;hould con|&s;ent&endq; to a Clau&s;e &s;o much again&s;t the honour of it;</Q> and went from him to the King, to be&s;eech him never to approve it. Some were of opi|nion <Q>&startq;that there were too few excepted from pardon; by which the King would not have confi&s;cations enough to &s;atisfy, and reward his&endq; Party: and others though,</Q> <Q>&startq;that there were too many excepted; and that it was not prudent to make &s;o many Men de&s;perate; but that it would be &s;ufficient to except <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Brad&s;haw,</HI> and three or <MILESTONE N="10"> four more of tho&s;e who&s;e malice was mo&s;t notorious; the whole Num|ber&endq; not to exceed Six.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> did not value the Clau&s;e for Foreign Divines, who, they knew, could per&s;wade little in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Synod; but they were im|placably offended, that the King mention'd the Government of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Book of Common-Prayer, with &s;o much reverence and devotion; which was the &s;harpne&s;s they mo&s;t fear'd of the Chancellor's &s;tyle, when they thought now the Covenant to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be in&s;i&s;ted upon more than ever. So that, when the Decla|ration was read at the Board the &s;econd time, mo&s;t Men being mov'd <MILESTONE N="20"> with the di&s;cour&s;es, and fears which were expre&s;s'd abroad of &s;ome ill effects it might produce, it was more faintly debated, and Men &s;eem'd not to think that the publi&s;hing any, at this time, was of &s;o much im|portance, as they formerly had conceiv'd it to be. By all which Men may judge, how hard a thing it was for the King to re&s;olve, and act with that &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;olution, which the mo&s;t unpro&s;perous con|dition doth more require than the State that is le&s;s perplex'd and in|tangled. Thus the Declaration &s;lept without farther propo&s;ition to pu|bli&s;h <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which it was laid a&s;ide.</NOTE> any.</P>
<P>ALL things being now as much provided for as they were like to be, <MILESTONE N="30"> the two Emba&s;&s;adours for <HI>Spain</HI> were very &s;ollicitous to begin their journey, the King being at la&s;t re&s;olv'd not to give his Mother the trouble of making a journey to meet him, but to go him&s;elf directly to S^t <HI>Germain</HI>'s, where her Maje&s;ty was. The Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to advance that re&s;olution, had promis'd to &s;upply the King with twenty thou&s;and pounds; which was too great a Loan for him to make, who had already great debts upon him, though it was very little for the enabling the King to di&s;charge the debts He and his Family had con|tracted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and to make his Journey. Out of this Sum the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor, were to receive &s;o much as was <MILESTONE N="40"> de&s;ign'd to defray their journey to <HI>Paris:</HI> what was nece&s;&s;ary for the di&s;charge of their Emba&s;&s;y, or for making their journey from <HI>Paris,</HI> was not yet provided. The King had &s;ome hope, that the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain</HI> would lend him &s;ome Money; which he de&s;ign'd for this &s;ervice; which made it nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould immediately re&s;ort to <HI>Bru&s;ells,</HI> to fini&s;h that Negotiation, and from thence to pro&s;ecute their journey.</P>
<P>IN the &s;olliciting their fir&s;t di&s;patch at the <HI>Hague,</HI> they made a di&s;|covery that &s;eem'd very &s;trange to them, though afterwards it was a truth that was very notorious. Their journey having been put off &s;ome days, only for the receipt of that &s;mall Sum, which was to be paid <MILESTONE N="50"> them out of the Money to be lent by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and <HI>Hem|&s;let</HI> the Prince's chief Officer in &s;uch affairs of Money, having been &s;ome days at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to negotiate that Loan, and no Money being
<PB N="240" REF="2580">
return'd, they believ'd that there was &s;ome affected delay; and &s;o went to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who had advis'd, and was well pleas'd with that Emba&s;&s;y, to know when that Money would be ready for the King, that he might likewi&s;e re&s;olve upon the time for his own Journey. The Prince told them, he believ'd, <Q>&startq;that They, who knew <HI>London</HI> &s;o well, and had heard &s;o much di&s;cour&s;e of the Wealth of <HI>Holland,</HI> would wonder very much that he &s;hould have been endeavouring above ten days to borrow twenty thou&s;and pounds; and that the riche&s;t Men in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> had promi&s;ed him to &s;upply him with it, and that one half&endq; of it was not yet provided.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;it was not that there was <MILESTONE N="$$"> any que&s;tion of his credit, which was very good; and that the &s;ecu|rity he gave, was as good as any Body de&s;ir'd, and upon which he could have double the Sum in le&s;s time, if he would receive it in Pa|per, which was the Cour&s;e of that Country; where bargains being made for one hundred thou&s;and pounds to be paid within ten days, it was never known that twenty thou&s;and pounds was paid together in one Town; but by Bills upon <HI>Rotterdam, Harlem,</HI> the <HI>Hague,</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and other places, which was as convenient, or more, to all parties; and he did verily believe, that though <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> could pay a Million within a Month, upon any good occa&s;ion, yet <MILESTONE N="20"> they would be troubled to bring twenty thou&s;and pounds together into any one room; and that was the true rea&s;on, that the Money was not yet brought to the <HI>Hague;</HI> which it &s;hould be within few&endq; days; as it was accordingly.</Q></P>
<P>THE Emba&s;&s;adours took their leave of the King at the <HI>Hague</HI> before <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Emba&s;&s;a|dours for</HI> Spain <HI>begin their Journey.</HI></NOTE> the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and had a Yatch from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that attended them at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and tran&s;ported them with great conve|nience to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where the Chancellor's Wife and his Family were arriv'd ten days before, and were &s;ettled in a good and convenient Hou&s;e; where the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and He both lodg'd whil&s;t they &s;tay'd <MILESTONE N="30"> in that City. There they met the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> in his way towards the King, to ha&s;ten the King's journey into <HI>France,</HI> upon the Queen's great importunity. He was very glad they were both come away from the King, and believ'd he &s;hould more ea&s;ily prevail with his Maje&s;ty in all things, as indeed he did. After two or three days &s;tay at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> they went to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> to deliver their Credentials both to the Arch-Duke, and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and to vi&s;it the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters, and, upon their Landing at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> they took it for a good Omen, that they were a&s;&s;ur'd <Q>&startq;that <HI>le Brune,</HI> who had been one of the Plenipotentiaries at the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> on the behalf of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> was <MILESTONE N="$$"> then in that Town with Credentials to vi&s;it the King, and to condole&endq; with him.</Q> They had an audience, the next day, of the Arch-Duke: they perform'd the Compliments to him from the King, and inform'd him of their Emba&s;&s;y into <HI>Spain,</HI> and de&s;ir'd his recommendation, and good Offices in that Court; which he, according to his &s;low, and for|mal way of &s;peaking, con&s;ented to: and they had no more to do with Him, but receiv'd the vi&s;its from the Officers, in his Name, according to the &s;tyle of that Court.

<P>THE Duke was a Prince that liv'd in a different manner from all other <MILESTONE N="$$"> Soveraign Princes in the world: from the time, that he had been driven out of his Country by <HI>France,</HI> he had retir'd to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> with his Army, which he kept up very &s;trong; and &s;erv'd the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with it
<PB N="241" REF="2590">
again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> upon &s;uch terms, and conditions, as were made, and renew'd every year between them; by which he receiv'd great Sums of Money yearly from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and was &s;ure very rich in Money. He allways commanded apart in the field: his Officers re|ceiv'd no Orders but from him&s;elf: he allways agreed at the Council of War what he &s;hould do, and his Army was in truth the be&s;t part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Forces. In the Town of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> he liv'd without any order, method, or &s;tate of a Prince, except towards the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in his Trea|ties, and being pre&s;ent in their Councils, where he allways kept his full Dignity: otherwi&s;e, he liv'd in a jolly familiarity with the Bourgeois and <MILESTONE N="10"> their Wives, and fea&s;ted with them, but &s;carce kept a Court or any num|ber of Servants, or Retinue. The Hou&s;e wherein he liv'd was a very ordinary one, and not furni&s;h'd; nor was he often there, or ea&s;y to be found; &s;o that the Emba&s;&s;adours could not ea&s;ily &s;end to him for an Au|dience. He receiv'd them in a lower room with great courte&s;y and fa|miliarity; and vi&s;ited them at their own Lodging. He was a Man of great wit, and pre&s;ence of mind, and, if he had not affected extrava|gancies, no man knew better how to act the Prince. He lov'd his Mo|ney very much; yet the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI>'s dexterity and addre&s;s, pre|vail'd with him to lend the King two thou&s;and Pi&s;tolls; which was all <MILESTONE N="20"> that was in their view for defraying their Emba&s;&s;y. But they hoped they &s;hould procure &s;ome &s;upply in <HI>Spain,</HI> out of which their own ne|ce&s;&s;ary expences mu&s;t be provided for.</P>
<P>THERE were two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by whom all the Councils there were govern'd and conducted, and which the Arch-Duke him&s;elf could not controle; the Conde of <HI>Pignoranda</HI> (who was newly come from <HI>Mun|&s;ter,</HI> being the other Plenipotentiary there; and &s;tay'd only at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> in expectation of renewing the Treaty again with <HI>France;</HI> but, whil&s;t he &s;tay'd there, was in the highe&s;t Tru&s;t of all the affairs) and the Conde of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna,</HI> who was the Governour of the Arms, and commanded <MILESTONE N="30"> the Army next under the Arch-Duke; which was a &s;ubordination very little inferior to the being General. They were both very able and ex|pert men in bu&s;ine&s;s, and if They were not very wi&s;e men, that Na|tion had none. The former was a Man of the Robe, of a great wit, and much experience, proud, and, if he had not been a little to pedan|tick, might very well be look'd upon as a very extraordinary Man, and was much improv'd by the excellent temper of <HI>le Brune</HI> (the other Ple|nipotentiary) who was indeed a wi&s;e Man, and by &s;eeming to defer in all things to <HI>Pignoranda,</HI> govern'd him. The <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna</HI> was of a much better temper, more indu&s;try, and more in&s;inuation <MILESTONE N="40"> than <HI>Spaniards</HI> u&s;e to have: his greate&s;t talent lay to Civil bu&s;ine&s;s; yet he was the be&s;t General of that time to all other offices and pur|po&s;es, than what were nece&s;&s;ary in the hour of Battle, when he was not &s;o pre&s;ent and compos'd as at all other &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>BOTH the&s;e receiv'd the Emba&s;&s;adours with the u&s;ual Civilities, and return'd their vi&s;its to their own Lodging, but &s;eem'd not plea&s;ed with their Journey to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and &s;poke much of the nece&s;&s;ities that Crown was in, and its di&s;ability to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King; which the Emba&s;&s;adours imputed to the influence <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> had upon them both; who remain'd &s;till under the &s;ame Character in <HI>England</HI> he had done <MILESTONE N="50"> for many years before. The &s;ame civilities were perform'd between <HI>le Brune</HI> and them; who treated them with much more freedom, and en|courag'd them to hope well from their Negotiation in <HI>Spain;</HI> acquainted
<PB N="242" REF="2600">
them with his own In&s;tructions, <Q>&startq;to give the King all a&s;&s;urance of the affection of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, and of his readine&s;s to do any thing&endq; for him that was in his power.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he only deferr'd his Jour|ney, becau&s;e he heard that the King intended to &s;pend &s;ome time at&endq; <HI>Breda;</HI></Q> and he had rather attend him There, than at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Emba&s;&s;adours had di&s;patch'd all their bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and receiv'd the Money from the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> they return'd to <HI>Antwerp;</HI> where they were to negotiate for the return of their Monies to <HI>Madrid;</HI> which requir'd very much warine&s;s, the Bills from thence finding now more difficulties at <HI>Madrid,</HI> than they had done in former <MILESTONE N="$$"> times.</P>
<P>BY the Letters my Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> brought, and the importunity he u&s;ed, the King re&s;olv'd to begin his Journey &s;ooner than he thought to have done, that is, &s;ooner than he thought he &s;hould have been able, all provi&s;ions being to begin to be made both for his Journey into <HI>France,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the Money was receiv'd that &s;hould pay for them. But the Queen's impatience was &s;o great to &s;ee his Ma|je&s;ty, that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Prince&s;s Royal his Wife, were as impatient to give her that &s;atisfaction. Though her Maje&s;ty could not ju&s;tly di&s;like any re&s;olution the King had taken, nor could imagine <MILESTONE N="$$"> whither he &s;hould go but into <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;he was exceedingly di&s;pleas'd that any re&s;olution at all had been taken before &s;he was con&s;ulted. She was angry that the Coun&s;ellors were cho&s;en without her directions, and look'd upon all that had been done, as done in order to exclude Her from medling in the Affairs; all which &s;he imputed principally to the Chancellor of the Exchequer: neverthele&s;s &s;he was not pleas'd with the de&s;ign of the Negotiation in <HI>Spain.</HI> For though &s;he had no confidence of his affection to Her, or rather of his complying with all her Commands, yet &s;he had all confidence in his Duty and Integrity to the King, and therefore wi&s;h'd he &s;hould be &s;till about his Per&s;on, and tru&s;ted in his <MILESTONE N="30"> bu&s;ine&s;s; which &s;he thought him much fitter for than &s;uch a Negotia|tion, which &s;he believ'd, out of her natural prejudice to <HI>Spain,</HI> would produce no advantage to the King.</P>
<P>THAT the Queen might receive &s;ome content, in knowing that the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|moves to</HI> $re|da.</NOTE> King had begun his Journey, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> de&s;ir'd him, <Q>&startq;whil&s;t his Servants prepar'd what was nece&s;&s;ary at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that Him&s;elf, and that part of his Train that was ready, would go to <HI>Breda,</HI> and&endq; &s;tay there till the re&s;t were ready to come up to him;</Q> that being his be&s;t way to <HI>Flanders,</HI> through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s into <HI>France. Breda</HI> was a Town of the Prince's own, where he had a hand&s;ome Palace and <MILESTONE N="40"> Ca&s;tle, and a place where the King might have many Diverti&s;ements. Hither the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour <HI>le Brune,</HI> came to attend his Maje&s;ty, and deliver'd his Ma&s;ter's Compliments to his Maje&s;ty, and offer'd his own &s;ervices to him, whil&s;t he &s;hould remain in tho&s;e Provinces; he being at that time de&s;ign'd to remain Emba&s;&s;adour to the united Pro|vinces; as he did; and died &s;hortly after at the <HI>Hague</HI> with a gene|ral regret. He was born a Subject to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in that part of <HI>Burgundy</HI> that was under his Dominion; and having been from his youth allways bred in bu&s;ine&s;s, and being a Man of great parts, and temper, he might very well be look'd upon as one of the be&s;t State&s;|men <MILESTONE N="50"> in Chri&s;tendom, and who be&s;t under&s;tood the true intere&s;t of all the Princes of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>AS SOON as the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor, heard of the
<PB N="243" REF="2610">
King's being at <HI>Breda,</HI> and that he intended to ha&s;ten his journey for <HI>France,</HI> they re&s;olv'd, having in truth not yet negotiated all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their Journey, to &s;tay till the King pa&s;&s;ed by, and not to go to S^t <HI>Germain</HI>'s till the fir&s;t interview, and eclarci&s;ments were pa&s;&s;ed between the King and Queen, that they might then be the better able to judge what Weather was like to be.</P>
<P>THE King was receiv'd at <HI>Antwerp</HI> with great magnificence: he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Antwerp:</NOTE> enter'd in a very rich Coach with &s;ix Hor&s;es, which the Arch-Duke &s;ent a pre&s;ent to him when he came into the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions: he was treated there, at the Charge of the City, very &s;plendidly for two days: <MILESTONE N="10"> and went then to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where he was lodged in the Palace, and royal|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Bru&s;&s;els.</NOTE> entertain'd. But the <HI>French</HI> Army, under the Command of the <HI>Conte de Harcourt,</HI> was two days before &s;et down before <HI>Cambray;</HI> with the News whereof the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Council was &s;urpri&s;ed, and in &s;o much di&s;order, that the Arch-Duke was gone to the Army to <HI>Mons,</HI> and <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> whil&s;t the King was in <HI>Antwerp;</HI> &s;o that the King was receiv'd only by his Officers; who perform'd their parts very well.</P>
<P>HERE the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Pignoranda</HI> waited upon the King in the qua|lity of an Emba&s;&s;adour, and cover'd. And his Maje&s;ty &s;tayed here three or four days, not being able &s;uddainly to re&s;olve which way he &s;hould <MILESTONE N="20"> pa&s;s into <HI>France.</HI> But he was not troubled long with that doubt; for the <HI>French</HI> thought to have &s;urpri&s;ed that Town, and to have ca&s;t up their Line of Circumvallation before any &s;upplies could be put in; but the <HI>Conde Fuen&s;aldagna</HI> found a way to put &s;even or eight hundred Foot into the Town; upon which the <HI>French</HI> rai&s;ed the Siege: and &s;o the King made his Journey by the u&s;ual way; and, near <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King had an Interview with the Arch-Duke near</HI> Valen|ciennes.</NOTE> had an interview with the Arch-Duke; and, after &s;ome &s;hort Ceremo|nies, continued on his Journey, and lodged at <HI>Cambray;</HI> where he was likewi&s;e treated by the <HI>Conde de Garcies,</HI> who was Governour there, and a very civil Gentleman. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>ABOUT a week after the King left <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> the two Emba&s;&s;adours pro&s;ecuted their Journey for <HI>Paris;</HI> where they &s;tayed only one day, and then went to S^t <HI>Germain</HI>'s; where the King and the Queen his Mo|ther, with both their Families, and the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s, then were; by whom they were receiv'd graciou&s;ly. They had no rea&s;on to repent their caution in &s;taying &s;o long behind the King, for they found the Court &s;o full of jealou&s;y and di&s;order, that every Body was glad that they were come. After the fir&s;t two or three days that the King and Queen had been together, which were &s;pent in tears and lamentations for the great alteration that had happen'd &s;ince their la&s;t parting, the <MILESTONE N="40"> Queen begun to confer with the King of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and what cour&s;e he meant to take; in which &s;he found him &s;o re&s;erv'd, as if he had no mind She &s;hould be conver&s;ant in it. He made no Apologies to her; which &s;he expected; nor any profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;igning him&s;elf up to Her advice. On the contrary, upon &s;ome expo&s;tulations, he had told her plainly, <Q>&startq;that he would allways perform his Duty towards her with great affection and exactne&s;s, but that in his bu&s;ine&s;s he would obey&endq; his own rea&s;on and judgement;</Q> and did as good as de&s;ire her not to trouble her &s;elf in his Affairs: and finding her pa&s;&s;ions &s;trong, he fre|quently retired from her with &s;ome abruptne&s;s, and &s;eem'd not to de&s;ire <MILESTONE N="50"> to be &s;o much in her Company as &s;he expected; and pre&s;cribed &s;ome new rules to be ob&s;erv'd in his own retirement, which he had not been accu&s;tom'd to.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="2620">
THIS kind of unexpected behaviour gave the Queen much trouble. She begun to think, that this di&s;tance, which the King &s;eem'd to affect, was more than the Chancellor of the Exchequer could wi&s;h; and that there was &s;ome Body el&s;e, who did her more di&s;&s;ervice: in&s;omuch as to the Ladies who were about her, whereof &s;ome were very much his Friends, &s;he &s;eem'd to wi&s;h, that the Chancellor were come. There was a Gentleman, who was newly come from <HI>England,</HI> and who came to the <HI>Hague</HI> after the Chancellor had taken his leave of the King, and had been ever &s;ince very clo&s;e about him, being one of the Grooms of his Bed-Chamber, one M^r <HI>Thomas Elliot,</HI> a Per&s;on &s;poken of before; <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Word$</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Elliot <HI>comes to the King: his In|fluence upon his Maje&s;ty.</HI></NOTE> whom the King's Father had formerly &s;ent into <HI>France,</HI> at the &s;ame time that he re&s;olv'd the Prince &s;hould go for the We&s;t; and for no other rea&s;on, but that he &s;hould not attend upon his Son. And he had given order, <Q>&startq;that if he &s;hould return out of <HI>France,</HI> and come into&endq; the We&s;t, the Council &s;hould not &s;uffer him to be about the Prince;</Q> with whom he thought he had too much credit, and would u&s;e it ill; and he had never &s;een the Prince from the time he left <HI>Oxford</HI> till now. He was a bold Man, and &s;poke all things confidently, and had not that reverence for the late King which he ought to have had; and le&s;s for the Queen; though he had great obligations to both; yet being not &s;o <MILESTONE N="$0"> great as he had a mind to, he looked upon them as none at all. This Gentleman came to the King ju&s;t as he left the <HI>Hague,</HI> and both as he was a new comer, and as one for whom his Maje&s;ty had formerly much kindne&s;s, was very well receiv'd; and being one who would re|ceive no injury from his Mode&s;ty, made the favour the King &s;hew'd him as bright, and to &s;hine as much in the eyes of all Men, as was po&s;|&s;ible. He was never from the Per&s;on of the King, and allways whi&s;per|ing in his Ear, taking upon him to under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e and opinion of all the Loyal party in <HI>England:</HI> and when he had a mind that the King &s;hould think well, or ill of any Man, he told him, <Q>&startq;that he was much&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> belov'd by, or very odious to all his Party there.</Q> By the&s;e infu&s;ions, he had prevailed with him to look with le&s;s grace upon the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who came from <HI>Caen</HI> (where he had hitherto re&s;ided) to ki&s;s his hands, than his own good-nature would have inclined him to; and more to di&s;countenance the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and to tell him plainly, <Q>&startq;that&endq; he &s;hould not &s;erve him in the place of Secretary of State;</Q> in which he had &s;erv'd his Father, and from which Men have &s;eldom been re|mov'd upon the De&s;cent of the Crown; and not to admit either Father or Son to be of his Council; which was more extraordinary. He told the King, <Q>&startq;it would be the mo&s;t unpopular thing he could do, and <MILESTONE N="40"> which would lo&s;e him more hearts in <HI>England</HI> than any other thing,&endq; if he were thought to be govern'd by his Mother.</Q> And in a Month's time that he had been about the King, he begun already to be looked upon as very like to become the Favorite. He had u&s;ed the Queen with wonderful neglect when &s;he &s;poke to him, and had got &s;o much Intere&s;t with the King, that he had procured a promi&s;e from his Maje&s;ty to make Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> who&s;e Daughter M^r <HI>Elliot</HI> had Married, Se|cretary of State; an hone&s;t Gentleman, but extreme unequal to that Province; towards which he could not pretend a better qualification, than that his Wife had been Nur&s;e to the Prince, who was now King <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>IN the&s;e kind of humours and indi&s;po&s;itions the Emba&s;&s;adours found the Court, when they came to S^t <HI>Germain</HI>'s. They had, during their &s;tay at <HI>Paris,</HI> in their way to Court, conferr'd with the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="2630">
and his Son the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> who breath'd out their Griefs to them; and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was the more troubled to find that M^r <HI>Elliot,</HI> who was a known and declared Enemy of his, had gotten &s;o much credit with the King, as to be able to &s;atisfy his own malice upon him, by the countenance of his Maje&s;ty; in whom, he knew, the King his Fa|ther de&s;ired, that he &s;hould of all Men have the lea&s;t Intere&s;t. After they had been a day or two there, the Chancellor of the Exchequer thinking it his Duty to &s;ay &s;omewhat to the Queen in particular, and knowing that &s;he expected he &s;hould do &s;o, and the King having told him at large all that had pa&s;&s;ed with his Mother, and the ill humour <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;he was in (all which his Maje&s;ty related in a more exalted Dialect than he had been accu&s;tom'd to) and his Maje&s;ty being very willing to un|der&s;tand what the Queen thought upon the whole, the Chancellor asked a private Audience; which her Maje&s;ty readily granted. And after &s;he <NOTE PLACE="marg">A private Audience of the Chancel|lor with the Queen.</NOTE> had gently expo&s;tulated upon the old pa&s;&s;ages at <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> &s;he concluded with the mention of the great confidence the King her Husband had allways repo&s;ed in him, and thereupon renew'd her own gracious pro|fe&s;&s;ions of good will towards him. Then &s;he complain'd, not without tears, of the King's unkindne&s;s towards her, and of his way of living with her, of &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions he had u&s;ed in di&s;cour&s;e in her own pre|&s;ence, <MILESTONE N="20"> and of what he had &s;aid in other places, and of the great credit M^r <HI>Elliot</HI> had with him, and of his rude behaviour towards her Ma|je&s;ty, and la&s;tly of the incredible de&s;ign of making <HI>Windham</HI> Secretary; <Q>&startq;&endq;who, be&s;ides his other unfitne&s;s,</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;would be &s;ure to joyn with&endq; the other to le&s;&s;en the King's kindne&s;s to her all they could.</Q> The Chan|cellor, after he had made all the profe&s;&s;ions of duty to her Maje&s;ty which became him, and &s;aid what he really believ'd of the King's kindne&s;s and re&s;pect for her, asked her, <Q>&startq;whether &s;he would give him leave to take notice of any thing &s;he had &s;aid to him, or, in general, that he found&endq; her Maje&s;ty un&s;atisfied with the King's unkindne&s;s?</Q> The Queen re|plied, <MILESTONE N="30"> <Q>&startq;that &s;he was well contented he &s;hould take notice of every thing &s;he had &s;aid; and, above all, of his purpo&s;e to make <HI>Windham&endq;</HI> Secretary: of which the King had not made the lea&s;t mention,</Q> though he had taken notice to him of mo&s;t other things the Queen had &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, &s;hortly after, found an opportunity to inform the King of all that had pa&s;&s;ed from the Queen, in &s;uch a method as might give him occa&s;ion to enlarge upon all the particulars. <Q>The King heard him very greedily, and prote&s;ted, &startq;that he de&s;ired nothing more than to live very well with the Queen; towards whom he would never fail <MILESTONE N="40"> in his Duty, as far as was con&s;i&s;tent with his honour, and the good of his Affairs; which, at pre&s;ent, it may be, required more re&s;ervation towards the Queen, and to have it believ'd that he communicated le&s;s with Her than he did, or than he intended to do: that, if he did not &s;eem to be de&s;irous of her Company, it was only when &s;he griev'd him by &s;ome importunities, in which he could not &s;atisfy her; and that her exception again&s;t <HI>Elliot</HI> was very unju&s;t; and that he knew well the Man to be very hone&s;t, and that he lov'd him well; and that the prejudice the King his Father had again&s;t him, was only by the malice of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who hated him without a cau&s;e, and had <MILESTONE N="50"> likewi&s;e inform'd the Queen of &s;ome fal&s;ehoods, which had incen&s;ed&endq; her Maje&s;ty again&s;t him;</Q> and &s;eem'd throughout much concern'd to ju&s;tify <HI>Elliot,</HI> again&s;t whom the Chancellor him&s;elf had no exceptions,
<PB N="246" REF="2640">
but receiv'd more re&s;pects from him than he paid to mo&s;t other Men.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor &s;poke of making <HI>Windham</HI> Secretary, the King did not own the having promi&s;ed to do it, but <Q>&startq;that he intended&endq; to do it:</Q> the Chancellor &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he was glad he had not promi&s;ed it; and that he hoped, he would never do it: that he was an hone&s;t Gen|tleman,&endq; but in no degree qualified for that Office.</Q> He put him in mind of Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who was then there to pre&s;ent his Duty to him; <Q>&startq;that he was a Per&s;on of &s;uch known affection and hone&s;ty,&endq; that he could not do a more ungracious thing than to pa&s;s Him by.</Q> <Q>The King &s;aid, &startq;he thought Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> to be a very hone&s;t <MILESTONE N="10"> Man; but he had no title to that Office more than another Man: that M^r <HI>Windham</HI> had not any experience in that Employment, but that it depended &s;o much upon forms, that he would quickly be in|&s;tructed in it: that he was a very hone&s;t Man, for whom he had never done any thing, and had now nothing el&s;e to give him but this place; for which he doubted not but, in a &s;hort time, he would make him|&s;elf&endq; very fit.</Q> All that the Chancellor could prevail with his Maje&s;ty, was to &s;u&s;pend the doing it for &s;ome time, and that he would hear him again upon the Subject, before he took a final re&s;olution. For the re&s;t, he promi&s;ed <Q>&startq;to &s;peak upon &s;ome particulars with the Queen, <MILESTONE N="20"> and to live with her with all kindne&s;s and freedom, that &s;he might&endq; be in good humour.</Q> But he heard Her, and all others, very un|willingly, who &s;poke again&s;t M^r <HI>Windham</HI>'s parts for being Secretary of State.</P>
<P>ONE day the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> when the Chancellor and &s;ome others were pre&s;ent, told the King very gravely (according to his cu&s;tom, who never &s;miled when he made others merry) <Q>&startq;that he had an hum|ble Suit to him, on the behalf of an old Servant of his Father's, and whom, he a&s;&s;ured him upon his knowledge, his Father lov'd as well as he did any Man of that condition in <HI>England;</HI> and that he had <MILESTONE N="30"> been for many years one of his Falconers; and he did really believe&endq; him to be one of the be&s;t Falconers in <HI>England;</HI></Q> and thereupon en|larged him&s;elf (as he could do very well, in all the terms of that Science) to &s;hew how very skilful he was in that art. <Q>The King asked him, &startq;&endq;what he would have him do for him?</Q> <HI>Cottington</HI> told him, <Q>&startq;it was very true that his Maje&s;ty kept no Falconers, and the poor Man was grown old, and could not ride as he had u&s;ed to do; but that he was a very hone&s;t Man, and could read very well, and had as audi|ble&endq; a voice as any Man need to have;</Q> and therefore be&s;ought his Ma|je&s;ty, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would make him his Chaplain;</Q> which &s;peaking with <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;o compo&s;ed a Countenance, and &s;omewhat of earne&s;tne&s;s, the King looked upon him with a &s;mile to know what he meant; when He, with the &s;ame gravity, a&s;&s;ured him, <Q>&startq;the Falconer was in all re&s;pects as fit&endq; to be his Chaplain, as Colonel <HI>Windham</HI> was to be Secretary of State;</Q> which &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed the King, who had never &s;poken to him of the mat|ter, all that were pre&s;ent being not able to ab&s;tain from laughing, that his Maje&s;ty was &s;omewhat out of countenance: and this being mer|rily told by &s;ome of the Standers by, it grew to be a &s;tory in all Com|panies, and did really divert the King from the purpo&s;e, and made the other &s;o much a&s;hamed of pretending to it, that there was no more <MILESTONE N="$$"> di&s;cour&s;e of it.</P>
<P>WHILST all Endeavours were u&s;ed to compo&s;e all ill humours here, that the King might pro&s;ecute his intended Voyage for <HI>Ireland,</HI> there
<PB N="247" REF="2650">
came very ill news from <HI>Ireland.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An account of the affairs in</HI> Ireland <HI>after the Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s arrival there.</HI></NOTE> was arriv'd, as hath been &s;aid before, the Confederate Catholicks, who held their a&s;&s;embly, as they had allways done, at <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> &s;ent Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to him to congratulate his Arrival, and to enter upon a Treaty of Peace, that they might all return to their obedience to the King. But the incon&s;tancy of that Nation was &s;uch, that, notwith&s;tanding their ex|perience of the ruin they had brought upon them&s;elves by their falling from their former Peace, and notwith&s;tanding that them&s;elves had &s;ent to <HI>Paris</HI> to importune the Queen and the Prince to &s;end the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> back to them, with all promi&s;es and prote&s;tations that they <MILESTONE N="10"> would not in&s;i&s;t upon any unrea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions; now he was come upon their invitation to them, they made new demands in point of Re|ligion, and in&s;i&s;ted upon other things, which if he &s;hould con&s;ent to, would have irreconcil'd all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were under the Lord <HI>Inchi|quin,</HI> upon whom his principal confidence was placed: By this means &s;o much time was &s;pent, that the Winter pa&s;&s;ed without any agreement; whereby they might have advanc'd again&s;t the Parliament Forces, which were then weak, and in want of all manner of &s;upplies, whil&s;t the di&s;|tractions continu'd in <HI>England</HI> between the Parliament and the Army, the divi&s;ions in the Army, and the pro&s;ecution of the King; during <MILESTONE N="20"> which the Governours there had work enough to look to them&s;elves; and left <HI>Ireland</HI> to provide for it &s;elf: and if that unfortunate People would have made u&s;e of the advantages that were offer'd, that Kingdom might indeed have been entirely reduced to the King's obedience.</P>
<P>THAT the Lord Lieutenant might even compel them to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, he went him&s;elf to <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> where the Council &s;ate, about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> after three months had been &s;pent from his arrival, that no more time might be lo&s;t in their Commi&s;&s;ioner's coming and going, and that the Spring might not be lo&s;t as well as the Winter. And at la&s;t a Peace was made and concluded; by which, again&s;t &s;uch a day, <MILESTONE N="30"> the Confederate Catholicks oblig'd them&s;elves, <Q>&startq;to bring into the field, a body of Hor&s;e and Foot, with all provi&s;ions for the field, which &s;hould be at the di&s;po&s;al of the Lord Lieutenant, and to march as&endq; he &s;hould appoint.</Q> The Treaty had been drawn out into the more length, in hope to have brought the whole Nation to the &s;ame agree|ment.

<P>THE truth is, there was nothing of Religion in this contention; which proceeded from the Animo&s;ity between the two Generals, <HI>O Neile</HI> and <HI>Pre|&s;$on,</HI> and the bitter Faction between the old <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and the other, who were as <MILESTONE N="50"> much hated by the old, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were; and la&s;tly, from the ambition of <HI>Owen O Neile;</HI> who expected &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions to be made to him in his own particular, which would very much have offended and incen&s;ed

the other party, if they had been granted to him: &s;o that the A&s;&s;embly was well pleas'd to leave him out, and concluded the Peace without him.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the Lord Lieutenant u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible endeavours that the Army might be form'd, and ready to march in the beginning of the Spring. And though there was not an appearance an&s;werable to their promi&s;e, yet their Troops &s;eem'd &s;o good, and were &s;o numerous, that he thought fit to march towards <HI>Dublin:</HI> and, in the way, to take all Ca&s;tles and Garri&s;ons, which were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Parliament: in which they had very good Succe&s;s. For many of the Parliament Soldiers hav|ing &s;erv'd the King, they took the fir&s;t opportunity, upon the Marquis <MILESTONE N="10"> of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s approach within any di&s;tance, to come to him; and by that means &s;everal places &s;urrender'd likewi&s;e to him. Colonel <HI>Monk,</HI> who had formerly &s;erv'd the King, and remain'd, for the &s;pace of three or four years, Pri&s;oner in the Tower, had been at la&s;t prevail'd with by the Lord <HI>Li&s;le</HI> to &s;erve the Parliament again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> plea&s;ing him&s;elf with an opinion that he did not therein &s;erve again&s;t the King. He was at this time Governour of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> a Garri&s;on about thirty miles from <HI>Dublin;</HI> which was no &s;ooner &s;ummon'd <HI>(Tredagh,</HI> and tho&s;e at a nearer di&s;tance, being taken) but he was compell'd by his own Soldiers to deliver it up; and if the Officer who commanded the party which <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;ummon'd him, had not been his Friend, and thereby hoped to have re|duced him to the King's &s;ervice, his Soldiers would have thrown him over the Walls, and made their own conditions afterwards; and mo&s;t of that Garri&s;on betook them&s;elves to the King's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>UPON all the&s;e Encouragements, before the Troops were come up to make the Army as numerous as it might have been, the Marquis was per&s;waded to block up <HI>Dublin</HI> at a very little di&s;tance; having good <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>blocks up</HI> Dublin.</NOTE> rea&s;on to hope, from the &s;mallne&s;s of the Garri&s;on, and a party of well affected People within the Town, that it would in a &s;hort time have been given up to him. In the mean time, he us'd all the means he could to <MILESTONE N="30"> ha&s;ten the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Troops, &s;ome whereof were upon their march, and others not yet rais'd, to come up to the Army. By all their Letters from <HI>Lon|don</HI> (with which, by the way of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the Ports of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> there was good Intelligence) they under&s;tood, that there were fifteen hundred, or two thou&s;and Men &s;hipp'd for <HI>Ireland:</HI> and the wind hav|ing been for &s;ome time again&s;t their coming for <HI>Dublin,</HI> there was an apprehen&s;ion that they might be gone for <HI>Mun&s;ter:</HI> whereupon the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> who was not confident of all his Garri&s;ons there, very <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> In|chiquin <HI>de|parts from him for</HI> Mun|&s;ter.</NOTE> unhappily departed with &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e to look after his Pro|vince; there being then no cau&s;e to apprehend any &s;ally out of <HI>Dublin,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> where they were not in a condition to look out of their own Walls. But he was not gone above two days, when the wind coming fair, the Ships expected came into the Port of <HI>Dublin;</HI> and landed a greater num|ber <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Recruits land at</HI> Dublin <HI>from</HI> England.</NOTE> of Soldiers, e&s;pecially of Hor&s;e, than was reported; and brought the News that <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf was made Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in|tended to be &s;hortly there with a very great &s;upply of Hor&s;e and Foot. This Fleet that was already come, had brought arms, and cloaths, and mo|ney, and victuals; which much exalted the Garri&s;on and the City; which pre&s;ently turn'd out of the Town &s;ome of tho&s;e who were &s;u&s;|pected to wi&s;h well to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and impri&s;on'd others. <MILESTONE N="50"> The &s;econd day after the arrival of the &s;uccours, <HI>Jones,</HI> who had been a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jones <HI>$all$$s out of</HI> Dublin, <HI>and beats the Marquis of</HI> Ormond&punc; <HI>Army</HI></NOTE> Lawyer, and was then Governour of <HI>Dublin,</HI> at Noon-day, march'd out of the City, with a Body of three thou&s;and Foot, and three or four

<P>IT may be remember'd, that the general In&s;urrections in the la&s;t year, the revolt of the Navy, and the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Scots,</HI> encouraged and drawn in by the Presbyterian Party, had &s;o di&s;turb'd and ob&s;tructed the Coun&s;els both in the Parliament, and in the Army, that nothing had been done in all that year towards the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> except the &s;ending over the Lord <HI>Li&s;le</HI> as Lieutenant, with a Commi&s;&s;ion that was determin'd at the end of &s;o many months, and which had given &s;o little relief to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that it only di&s;cover'd more their weakne&s;s, and animo&s;ity towards each other, than ob&s;tructed the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in making <MILESTONE N="$0"> their progre&s;s in all the parts of the Kingdom; and the more confirm'd the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> to pur&s;ue his Re&s;olutions of &s;erving the King, and of receiving the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> how meanly &s;oever attended, and to unite with the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> the per&s;ecting of which conjunction, with &s;o general a &s;ucce&s;s, brought &s;o great reproach upon the Parliament, with reference to the lo&s;s of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the noi&s;e thereof was very great: So that <HI>Cromwell</HI> thought it high time, in his own Per&s;on, to appear <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>made Lord Lieutenant of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> upon a State of &s;o great Action. There had been allways Men enough to be &s;par'd out of the Army to have been &s;ent upon that Expedition, when the other difficulties were at highe&s;t; but the conducting it then <MILESTONE N="30"> was of that importance, that it was, upon the matter, to determine which power &s;hould be &s;uperior, the Presbyterian or the Independent. And therefore the one had &s;et up and de&s;ign'd <HI>Waller</HI> for that command, and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> again&s;t Him and that party, had in&s;i&s;ted, that it &s;hould be given to <HI>Lambert,</HI> the &s;econd Man of the Army, who was known to have as great a dete&s;tation of the Presbyterian power, as he had of the Prerogative of the Crown: and the Conte&s;ts between the two Factions, which of the&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent, had &s;pent a great part of the la&s;t year, and of their Winter coun&s;els. But now, when all the Dome&s;tick differences were compos'd by their &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the field, and the bloody pro&s;ecution <MILESTONE N="40"> of their civil coun&s;els, &s;o that there could be little done to the di&s;tur|bance of the Peace of <HI>England,</HI> and when <HI>Waller</HI>'s friends were &s;o &s;up|pre&s;s'd, that he was no more thought of, <HI>Cromwell</HI> began to think that the committing the whole Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with &s;uch an Army as was nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;ent thither, was too great a Tru&s;t even for his beloved <HI>Lambert</HI> him&s;elf, and was to le&s;&s;en his own power and autho|rity, both in the Army which was commanded by <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and in the other, that, being in <HI>Ireland,</HI> would, upon any occa&s;ion, have great in|fluence upon the Affairs of <HI>England.</HI> And therefore, whil&s;t there appear'd no other ob&s;tructions in the relief of <HI>Ireland</HI> (which was every day loudly <MILESTONE N="50"> call'd for) than the determining who &s;hould take that Charge, &s;ome of his Friends, who were allways ready upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, on a &s;uddain propos'd <HI>Cromwell</HI> Him&s;elf the Lieutenant General, to conduct that Expedition.</P>

CROMWELL him&s;elf was allways ab&s;ent when &s;uch overtures were to be made; and whoever had propos'd <HI>Lambert,</HI> had propos'd it as a thing mo&s;t agreeable to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s de&s;ire; and therefore, when they heard <HI>Cromwell</HI> Him&s;elf propo&s;ed for the &s;ervice, and by tho&s;e who they were &s;ure intended him no affront, they immediatlely acquie&s;ced in the Propo&s;ition, and look'd upon the change as a good expedient: on the other &s;ide, the Presbyterian party was no le&s;s affected, and concluded that this was only a trick to defer the &s;ervice, and that he never did in|tend to go thither in Per&s;on; or that if he did, his ab&s;ence from <HI>England</HI> would give them all the advantages they could wi&s;h, and that they <MILESTONE N="$$"> &s;hould then recover entirely their General <HI>Fairfax</HI> to their Party; who was already much broken in &s;pirit upon the concurrence he had been drawn to, and declar'd &s;ome bitterne&s;s again&s;t the Per&s;ons who had led him to it. And &s;o in a moment both Parties were agreed, and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> elected and declar'd to be Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with as ample, and independent a Commi&s;&s;ion, as could be prepar'd.</P>
<P>CROMWELL, how little &s;urpri&s;ed &s;oever with this de&s;ignation, ap|pear'd the next day in the Hou&s;e full of confu&s;ion and irre&s;olution; which the natural temper, and compo&s;ure of his under&s;tanding could hardly avoid, when he lea&s;t de&s;ir'd it; and therefore, when it was now to his <MILESTONE N="20"> purpo&s;e, he could act it to the life. <Q>And after much he&s;itation, and ma|ny expre&s;&s;ions of &startq;his own unworthine&s;s, and di&s;ability to &s;upport &s;o great a Charge, and of the entire re&s;ignation of him&s;elf to Their com|mands, and ab&s;olute dependence upon God's providence and ble&s;&s;ing,&endq; from whom he had receiv'd many In&s;tances of his Favour,</Q> he &s;ub|mitted to their good will and plea&s;ure; and de&s;ir'd them <Q>&startq;that no more time might be lo&s;t in the preparations which were to be made for &s;o great a Work: for he did confefs that Kingdom to be reduced to &s;o great &s;treights, that he was willing to engage his own Per&s;on in this expedi|tion, for the difficulties which appear'd in it; and more out of hope, with <MILESTONE N="30"> the hazard of his life, to give &s;ome ob&s;truction to the &s;ucce&s;&s;es which&endq; the Rebels were at pre&s;ent exalted with</Q> (for &s;o he call'd the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and all who joyn'd with him) <Q>&startq;that &s;o the Common-Wealth might retain &s;till &s;ome footing in that Kingdom, till they might be able to &s;end fre&s;h &s;upplies, than out of any expectation, that, with the &s;trength he carried, he &s;hould be able, in any &s;ignal degree, to prevail over&endq; them.</Q></P>
<P>IT was an incredible expedition that he u&s;ed from this minute after <NOTE PLACE="marg">He provides Forces for his going thither.</NOTE> his a&s;&s;uming that Charge, in the rai&s;ing of money, providing of &s;hipping, and drawing of Forces together, for this enterpri&s;e.

<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> at that time, drew off his whole Army from <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Tredagh,</HI> where he meant to remain till he could put it into &s;uch a po&s;ture, that he might pro&s;ecute his farther de&s;ign.

<P>FRANCE had too good an excu&s;e at this time for not giving the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> France <HI>whil&s;t the King was at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in Money, which he might expect, and did abundantly want, by the ill condition their own Affairs were in. Though the &s;e|dition which had been rai&s;ed in <HI>Paris</HI> the la&s;t Winter, was at pre&s;ent <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;o much appea&s;ed by the courage, and conduct of the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> (who brought the Army, which he commanded in <HI>Flanders,</HI> with &s;o great expedition before <HI>Paris,</HI> that the City yielded to rea&s;on) &s;o that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, the Queen his Mother, and the whole Court, were at this pre&s;ent there; yet the wound was far from being clo&s;ed up. The Town continued &s;till in ill humour; more of the great Men adher'd to them than had done before; the Animo&s;ities again&s;t the Car|dinal increa&s;ed, and, which made tho&s;e Animo&s;ities the more terrible, the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> who &s;urely had merited very much, either un&s;a|tisfied, or not to be &s;atisfied, broke his friend&s;hip with the Cardinal, and <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;poke with much bitterne&s;s again&s;t him: So that the Court was far from being in that tranquillity, as to concern it &s;elf much for the King our Ma&s;ter, if it had been otherwi&s;e well inclined to it.</P>
<P>ALL things &s;tanding thus, about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves S^t</HI> Ger|main<HI>'s; and goes towards</HI> Jer&s;ey.</NOTE> left S^t <HI>Germain</HI>'s, and begun his journey towards <HI>Jer&s;ey;</HI> and the Queen, the next day, remov'd from thence to <HI>Paris</HI> to the <HI>Louvre.</HI> The two Emba&s;&s;adours for <HI>Spain</HI> waited upon her Maje&s;ty thither, having no|thing now to do but to prepare them&s;elves for their journey to <HI>Spain,</HI> where they longed to be, and whither they had &s;ent for a Pa&s;s to meet them at S^r <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI>'s, and that they might have a Hou&s;e provided for <MILESTONE N="50"> them at <HI>Madrid,</HI> again&s;t the time they &s;hould come thither: both which they recommended to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, who liv'd there, to &s;ollicite, and adverti&s;e them in their journey of the temper of that Court.</P>

THEY thought it convenient, &s;ince they were to de&s;ire a Pa&s;s to go from <HI>Paris</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> that they &s;hould wait upon the Queen Mother of <HI>France,</HI> and the Cardinal; and likewi&s;e upon the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;;</HI> who were then in a Cabal again&s;t the Court. The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &s;poke &s;o publickly, and &s;o warmly again&s;t the Car|dinal, that mo&s;t People thought the Cardinal undone; and he him&s;elf apprehended &s;ome attempt upon his Per&s;on; and therefore had not in many days gone out of his Hou&s;e, and admitted few to come to him, and had a &s;trong Guard in every room; &s;o that his fear was not di&s;|&s;embled. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>IN this &s;o general di&s;order, the Emba&s;&s;adours declined any formal Audiences; for which their Equipage was not &s;uitable: &s;o the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> went privately to the Queen Regent, who receiv'd him gra|ciou&s;ly, and de&s;ired him <Q>&startq;to recommend her very kindly to her Brother&endq; the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> without enlarging upon any thing el&s;e.</Q> From Her he went to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> whom he found in more di&s;order; and when the Emba&s;&s;adour told him, <Q>&startq;he came to know whether he had&endq; any Service to command him into <HI>Spain,</HI> the Duke,</Q> who &s;carce &s;tood &s;till whil&s;t he was &s;peaking, an&s;wer'd aloud, <Q>&startq;that he had nothing to&endq; do with <HI>Spain;</HI> and &s;o went ha&s;tily into another room;</Q> and the Lord <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Cottington</HI> then withdrew. They intended both to have gone together to the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> and to the Cardinal. But when they &s;ent to the Prince, he wi&s;ely, but with great civility, &s;ent them word, <Q>&startq;that they could not be ignorant of the di&s;order that Court was in, and of&endq; the jealou&s;ies which were of him;</Q> and therefore de&s;ired them <Q>&startq;to ex|cu&s;e&endq; him, that he did not &s;ee them.</Q></P>
<P>THE Cardinal appointed them a time; and accordingly they met, and conferr'd together about half an hour, the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> &s;peak|ing <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and the Cardinal and He conferring wholely in that Lan|guage. The Cardinal acknowledged the apprehen&s;ion he was in, in his <MILESTONE N="30"> looks; and took occa&s;ion in his di&s;cour&s;e to mention <Q>&startq;the unju&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure,&endq; which Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Prince</HI> had conceiv'd again&s;t him.</Q> He &s;eem'd earne&s;tly to de&s;ire a Peace between the two Crowns; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would give a pound of his blood to obtain it;</Q> and de&s;ir'd the Emba&s;&s;adours <Q>&startq;to tell <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> from him, that he would with all his heart meet him upon the Frontiers; and that he was con|fident, if they two were together but three hours, they &s;hould com|po&s;e&endq; all differences: which Me&s;&s;age he afterwards di&s;avow'd,</Q> when <HI>Don Lewis</HI> accepted the motion, and was willing to have met him. When they took their leave of him, he brought them to the top of <MILESTONE N="40"> the &s;tairs in di&s;order enough, his Guards being very circum&s;pect, and &s;uffering no &s;tranger to approach any of the rooms.</P>
<P>THEY begun their journey from <HI>Paris</HI> upon <HI>Michaelmas</HI> day, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Cottin$ton <HI>and the Chan|cellor be$$n their journey for</HI> $pain, <HI>and arrive at</HI> Bourdeaux.</NOTE> continu'd it, without re&s;ting one day, till they came to <HI>Bourdeaux;</HI> which was then in Rebellion again&s;t the King. The City and the Par|liament had not only &s;ent &s;everal complaints, and bitter invectives again&s;t the Duke of <HI>E&s;pernon,</HI> their Governour, for his Acts of Ty|ranny in his Government, but had pre&s;um'd, in order to make his Per|&s;on the more ungracious, to a&s;per&s;e his life and manners with tho&s;e reproaches which they believ'd would mo&s;t reflect upon the Court. And <MILESTONE N="50"> the truth is, their greate&s;t quarrel again&s;t him was, that he was a fa&s;t friend to the Cardinal, and would not be divided from his Intere&s;t. They had driven the Duke out of the Town, and did not only de&s;ire
<PB N="254" REF="2720">
the King <Q>&startq;that he might no more be their Governour; but that his&endq; Maje&s;ty would give the Government to the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;;</HI></Q> which made their complaints the le&s;s con&s;ider'd as ju&s;t. And it was then one of the mo&s;t avow'd exceptions that Prince had again&s;t the Cardinal, that he had not that Government upon the Petition of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> &s;ince he offer'd to re&s;ign his of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> which was held to be of as much Value, to accommodate and repair the Duke of <HI>E&s;pernon.</HI> At <HI>Blay,</HI> the Emba&s;&s;adours were vi&s;ited by the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Ple&s;&s;y Pra&s;lin,</HI> who had been &s;ent by the Court to treat with the Parliament of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> but could bring them to no rea&s;on, they po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ting upon the re|move <MILESTONE N="10"> of their old Governour, and conferring the Command upon the Prince. When they came to <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> they found the <HI>Ch&acirc;teau Trom|pette,</HI> which &s;till held for the King, &s;hooting at the Town, the Town having inve&s;ted it very clo&s;e, that no Succour could be put into them, the Duke of <HI>E&s;pernon</HI> being at his Hou&s;e at <HI>Cadilliac,</HI> from whence his Hor&s;e every day infe&s;ted the Citizens when they &s;tirr'd out of the Town. Here the Emba&s;&s;adours were compell'd to &s;tay one whole day, the di&s;|orders upon the River, and in the Town, not &s;uffering their Coaches and Baggage to follow them &s;o &s;oon as they &s;hould have done. They were here vi&s;ited by &s;ome Coun&s;ellors, and Pre&s;idents of the Parliament; <MILESTONE N="20"> who profe&s;&s;ed duty to their King, but irreconcilable hatred to the Duke of <HI>E&s;pernon;</HI> again&s;t whom they had publi&s;hed &s;everal Remon&s;trances in print, and dedicated them to the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;.</HI> After a day's re&s;t there, which was not unwelcome to them, they continued their journey to <HI>Bayonne;</HI> and arriv'd, upon the twentieth day from their leaving <HI>Paris,</HI> at the <HI>Taio;</HI> where they took boat, and in an hour or two ar|riv'd at <HI>Girona.</HI> The next day they went by the River to <HI>Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> and when they came out of their boats, which were row'd by Women, ac|cording to their Privilege there, they found Mules, &s;ent from S^t <HI>Se|ba&s;tian</HI>'s to carry them thither. About half a mile from the Town they <MILESTONE N="30"> were met by the Governour of <HI>Guipu&s;coa, Don Antonio de Cardinas,</HI> an old Soldier, and a Knight of the Order, the <HI>Corregidor</HI> and all the Magi&s;trates of S^t <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI>'s, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants which inhabited there; and were conducted by the Governour to one of the be&s;t Hou&s;es in the Town, which was provided for their reception; where they no &s;ooner were, than the Governour, and the re&s;t of the Magi&s;trates, took their leave of them.</P>
<P>THEY had not been half an hour in their Lodging, conferring with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, about conveniencies to pro&s;ecute their journey, when the <HI>Corregidor</HI> came to them, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with them in <MILESTONE N="40"> private, and after &s;ome compliment and apology, he &s;hew'd them a Letter, which he had receiv'd from the Secretary of State; the contents whereof were, <Q>&startq;that when the Emba&s;&s;adours of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould arrive there, they &s;hould be receiv'd with all re&s;pect; but that he &s;hould find &s;ome means to per&s;wade them to &s;tay and remain there, till he &s;hould give the King notice of it, and receive his farther plea|&s;ure.&endq;</Q> And at the &s;ame time an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant of the Town, who had told them before, that he had Letters from <HI>Madrid</HI> for them, and had gone home to fetch them, brought them a Pacquet from S^r <HI>Ben|jamin Wright;</HI> who was intru&s;ted by them to &s;ollicite at <HI>Madrid</HI> for <MILESTONE N="50"> their Pa&s;s, and for a Hou&s;e to be prepared for them. In this Letter their Pa&s;s was inclo&s;ed, under the &s;ame Style, as Emba&s;&s;adours from the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> which he had ob&s;erv'd upon the place, and de&s;ired
<PB N="255" REF="2730">
to have it mended, but could procure no alteration, nor could he ob|tain any Order for the providing a Hou&s;e for them; but was told, <Q>&startq;that&endq; it &s;hould be done time enough.</Q> This was an unexpected mortification to them; but they &s;eem'd not to be troubled at it, as if they had in|tended to &s;tay there a Month, to refre&s;h them&s;elves after their long journey, and in expectation of other Letters from the King their Ma|&s;ter. The <HI>Corregidor</HI> offer'd to &s;end away an Expre&s;s the &s;ame night, which they accepted of; and writ to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> <Q>&startq;that the King their Ma&s;ter had &s;ent them his Emba&s;&s;adours to his Catholick Maje&s;ty, upon affairs of the highe&s;t importance: that they were come <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;o far on their way, but had, to their great wonder, met there with a &s;ignification of that King's plea&s;ure, that they &s;hould &s;tay and re|main there, till they &s;hould receive his Maje&s;tie's farther Orders; which troubled them not &s;o much, as to find them&s;elves &s;tyled the Emba&s;&s;adours of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> which they thought very &s;trange, after his Catholick Maje&s;ty had &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;adour to the King their Ma&s;ter before they left him: they de&s;ired therefore to know, whe|ther their Per&s;ons were unacceptable to his Catholick Maje&s;ty, and if That were the ca&s;e, they would immediately return to their Ma&s;ter; otherwi&s;e, if his Maje&s;ty were content to receive them, they de&s;ired <MILESTONE N="20"> they might be treated in that manner as was due to the honour and dignity of the King their Ma&s;ter. And they writ to S^r <HI>Benjamin Wright,</HI> to attend <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> and if he found that they were expected at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that they reform'd the Errors they had committed, he &s;hould then u&s;e tho&s;e importunities, which were nece&s;&s;ary for the pro|viding&endq; a Hou&s;e for them again&s;t they &s;hould come.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the Court was then full of bu&s;ine&s;s, being in daily expecta|tion of their new Queen; who was landed, and at that time within few days journey of <HI>Madrid;</HI> yet the very next day after the Letter was deliver'd to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> he return'd an An&s;wer full of civility, <MILESTONE N="30"> and imputed the error that was committed, to the negligence, or igno|rance of the Secretary; and &s;ent them new Pa&s;&s;es in the proper Style; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pa&s;&s;es are &s;ent to them.</NOTE> and a&s;&s;ured them, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould find a very good welcome from&endq; his Maje&s;ty.</Q> And S^r <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> &s;ent them word, <Q>&startq;that he had receiv'd the Warrant for the providing the Hou&s;e; and the Officer, to whom it was directed, had called upon him to view two or three Hou&s;es; and that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> told him, that a&s;&s;oon as he had found a Hou&s;e that plea&s;ed him, Orders &s;hould be given to the King's Officers of the Wardrobe to furni&s;h it; and then when the Emba&s;&s;adours came, there &s;hould be one of the King's Coaches to attend them whil&s;t they&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;tayed.</Q> Hereupon they made ha&s;t in their journey, with &s;ome &s;ati&s;|faction and confidence that they &s;hould find a Court not &s;o hard to treat with, that could begin to receive them with &s;o bare-faced and form'd an Affront, and then &s;o ea&s;ily recede from it with weak Apologies. And it was plain enough, that they heartily wi&s;h'd that they had not come; and imagin'd that this might put them to return again, and then were a&s;hamed of their own Expedient, and being pre&s;&s;ed, cho&s;e rather to de|cline than avow it: So unnatural a thing is it for that Court to &s;toop to any ugly Action, without doing it &s;o ungraciou&s;ly, as to confe&s;s it in their own Countenance, and quickly receding from it. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>IT was about the middle of <HI>November</HI> when they left S^t <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI>'s, the Weather yet continuing fair; and a Gentleman of Quality of the Country was appointed to accompany them out of the juri&s;diction of
<PB N="256" REF="2740">
<HI>Guipu&s;coa,</HI> which was to the City of <HI>Victoria;</HI> and from thence they enter'd into <HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI> When they came to <HI>Alcavendas,</HI> within three Leagues of <HI>Madrid,</HI> they &s;ent to S^r <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> to know what Hou&s;e was provided for them: he came to them, and told them, <Q>&startq;all things were in the &s;ame &s;tate they were when he writ to them to S^t <HI>Se|ba&s;tian</HI>'s; that though <HI>Don Lewis</HI> gave him very good words, and &s;eem'd much troubled and angry with the Officers that the Hou&s;e was not ready, and the Officers excu&s;ed them&s;elves upon the jollities the Town was in during the <HI>Fie&s;tas,</HI> which were held every day for the Queen's arrival, that no body could attend any particular affair, yet <MILESTONE N="$$"> it was evident there was not that care taken from the Court that there ought to have been, and that <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> from <HI>England</HI> had done the Emba&s;&s;adours all the ill offices po&s;&s;ible, as if their good reception in <HI>Spain</HI> would incen&s;e the Parliament, and make them more propitious to <HI>France,</HI> which valued it &s;elf upon having driven all the&endq; Royal Family from thence.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this new Mortification, they writ again from thence to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> to de&s;ire <Q>&startq;that they might not be put to &s;tay there for want of&endq; a Hou&s;e, and &s;o be expo&s;ed to contempt.</Q> Nor were they accommo|dated in that place in any degree. He allways an&s;wer'd their Letters <MILESTONE N="20"> with great punctuality, and with courte&s;y enough, as if all things &s;hould be ready by the next day. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, who re&s;ided at <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> came every day to vi&s;it them, but &s;till brought them word, that there was no appearance of any provi&s;ion made to receive them; &s;o that, after a week's &s;tay in that little Town, and ill accommodation, they ac|cepted the civil offer and invitation, which S^r <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> made them, of repo&s;ing them&s;elves <HI>incognito</HI> in his Hou&s;e; which would only receive their Per&s;ons with a <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> for each; and the re&s;t of their family was quarter'd in the next adjacent Hou&s;es for the re|ception of Strangers; &s;o they went privately in the evening into <HI>Ma|drid</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They go into</HI> Madrid in|cognito; <HI>and lodge at fir&s;t at S^r</HI> Benja|min Wright<HI>'s Hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"> in S^r <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI>'s Coach, and came to his Hou&s;e: and if, by His genero&s;ity, they had not been thus accommodated, they mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to reproach and infamy, by the very little re&s;pect they receiv'd from the Court. This S^r <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> was a Gentle|man of a good family in <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and, being a younger Brother, had been bred a Merchant in <HI>Madrid;</HI> where he had great bu&s;ine&s;s, and great reputation; and, having married a Wife of the Family of <HI>Toledo,</HI> was become a perfect <HI>Spaniard,</HI> not only in the Language, but in the generous part of their Nature and Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>THE Court well enough knew of their Arrival, but took no notice <MILESTONE N="40"> of it. The Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> therefore &s;ent to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> to de&s;ire that he might have a private Audience of him <HI>incognito;</HI> which he pre&s;ently con&s;ented to, and appointed, the next morning, to meet in the King's Gar|den; which was at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Court, that it was not in the view of it. There they met at the hour: <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was a Man of little ceremony, and u&s;ed no flouri&s;hes in his di&s;cour&s;es, which made mo&s;t Men believe that he &s;aid all things from his heart; and he &s;eem'd to &s;peak &s;o cordially, that the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> who was not ea&s;y to be impo&s;ed upon, did think that they &s;hould have a Hou&s;e very &s;peedily, and that he had a good inclination to favour them in what they came <MILESTONE N="50"> about. He &s;poke, with more commotion than was natural to him, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Murther of the King; excu&s;ed all the omi&s;&s;ions towards the Emba&s;&s;adours; <Q>&startq;which &s;hould be repair'd out of hand, after
<PB N="257" REF="2750">
the few days, which yet remain'd to be &s;pent in <HI>Fie&s;tas</HI> for the Queen; during which time, he &s;aid, no Officers would obey any orders that&endq; diverted them from the &s;ight of the Triumphs;</Q> and wi&s;h'd <Q>&startq;that the Emba&s;&s;adours would &s;ee the Ma&s;querade that afternoon, and the <HI>Toros&endq;</HI> the day following.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> return'd home very well &s;atisfied; and had not been half an hour in the Hou&s;e, when a Gentleman came from <HI>Don Lewis</HI> to invite the Emba&s;&s;adours to &s;ee tho&s;e Exerci&s;es, which are men|tion'd before; and &s;ent them word that there &s;hould be places provided for them. The Chancellor went that afternoon to the place a&s;&s;ign'd, <MILESTONE N="10"> where he &s;aw the Ma&s;querade, and the running of the Cour&s;e, and, afterwards, the <HI>Toros.</HI></P>
<P>AT the running of the Cour&s;e, the King and <HI>Don Lewis</HI> run &s;everal Cour&s;es, in all which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was too good a Courtier to win any prize, though he allways lo&s;t it by very little. The appearance of the People was very great, and the Ladies in all the windows made a very rich &s;hew, otherwi&s;e the &s;hew it &s;elf had nothing wonderful. Here there happen'd to be &s;ome &s;uddain &s;harp words between the <HI>Admirante</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> a haughty young Man, and the Marquis <HI>de Liche,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro;</HI> the which being taken notice of, they <MILESTONE N="20"> were both di&s;mi&s;s'd the Squadrons wherein they were, and committed to their Chambers.</P>
<P>AT the Entertainment of the <HI>Toros</HI> there was another accident, the mention whereof is not unfit to &s;hew the di&s;cipline, and &s;everity of that Nation in the ob&s;ervation of order. It was remember'd, that at the Ma&s;querade, the <HI>Admirante</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Liche</HI> were &s;ent to their Chambers: and afterwards, the matter being examin'd, they were both commanded to leave the Town, and retire each to a Hou&s;e of his own, that was within three or four Leagues of the Town. The Marquis of <HI>Liche</HI> was known to have gone the next day, and no body <MILESTONE N="30"> doubted the &s;ame of the <HI>Admirante,</HI> tho&s;e orders being never di&s;puted or di&s;obey'd. The King as he was going to the <HI>Toros,</HI> either him&s;elf di&s;cern'd at another Balcony, or &s;ome body el&s;e adverti&s;ed him of it, that the Duche&s;s, who was Wife to the <HI>Admirante,</HI> was there; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he knew that Lady was a Woman of more honour than to come out of her Hou&s;e, and be pre&s;ent at the <HI>Fie&s;ta,</HI> whil&s;t her Husband&endq; was under re&s;traint, and in his Maje&s;tie's di&s;plea&s;ure;</Q> and therefore concluded that her Husband was likewi&s;e there; and thereupon &s;ent an <HI>Alguazil</HI> to that room, with command to examine carefully with his Eye, whether the <HI>Admirante</HI> was there; for there appear'd none but <MILESTONE N="40"> Women. The <HI>Admirante,</HI> being a young ra&s;h Man, much in the King's favour, and a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, thought he might un|di&s;cerned &s;ee the Triumph of that day; and therefore cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be dre&s;s'd in the habit of a Lady, which his age would well bear, and forced his Wife to go with him; who exceedingly re&s;i&s;ted his Commands, well knowing to what reproach &s;he expos'd her own honour, though &s;he had no fear of his being di&s;cover'd. The <HI>Alguazil</HI> brought the King word, that he was very &s;ure that the <HI>Admirante</HI> was there, in the habit of a Woman, and &s;at next his Wife among many other Ladies. Whereupon the King &s;ent the Officer to apprehend him in the habit he <MILESTONE N="$$"> was in, and to carry him to the Officer's own Hou&s;e. And a&s;&s;oon as the King return'd to the Palace, there was an Order that the <HI>Alguazil</HI> &s;hould the next morning carry the <HI>Admirante</HI> to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> four days

journey from <HI>Madrid,</HI> to a Hou&s;e of his own there; where he was con|fin'd not to go out of the limits of that City; and under this re&s;traint remain'd for the &s;pace of full three years: So penal a thing it is among&s;t that People, for any Man, of how great Quality &s;oever (there was not in <HI>Spain</HI> a Man of greater than the <HI>Admirante</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tile)</HI> to di&s;obey, or elude the judgement of the King.</P>
<P>IT may be thought impertinent to the work in hand, to make a di|gre&s;&s;ion upon this Emba&s;&s;y, and to enlarge upon many circum&s;tances which occurr'd in it, of the formality and con&s;titution of that Court, of the nature and humour of that People, which may &s;eem foreign to <MILESTONE N="10"> the affairs of <HI>England.</HI> But &s;ince the King, after his leaving <HI>Paris,</HI> re|mained <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|mains &s;everal Months in</HI> Jer|&s;ey.</NOTE> in <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> for many Months, waiting &s;uch a revolution as might admini&s;ter an opportunity and occa&s;ion to quit that retirement, in all which time there was no Action, or Coun&s;el to be mention'd, and this being the fir&s;t, and the only Emba&s;&s;y, in which his Maje&s;tie's per&s;on was repre&s;ented, until his ble&s;&s;ed return into <HI>England</HI> (for though &s;ome other Per&s;ons were afterwards &s;ent to other Princes, with Commi&s;&s;ions to per|form that function, if they found Encouragement &s;o to do, yet none a&s;&s;um'd that Character, nor were treated as &s;uch in any Court in Chri|&s;tendom, <HI>Spain</HI> only excepted) it may therefore be rea&s;onably thought <MILESTONE N="20"> not improper in this Hi&s;tory, to give &s;uch a relation of this Negotia|tion, that it may appear what &s;en&s;e &s;o great a Court as that of <HI>Spain</HI> had of tho&s;e Revolutions in <HI>England,</HI> and of the deplorable condition to which this young innocent Prince was reduced, when it was fully pre&s;s'd to them in the mo&s;t efficacious terms po&s;&s;ible; and every circum&s;tance of their reception, and treatment, may &s;erve to illu&s;trate tho&s;e parti|culars; and therefore we &s;hall proceed farther in the relation of them.</P>

<P>UPON the day a&s;&s;ign'd for the Audience, it being re&s;olv'd that when they had ended with the King, they &s;hould likewi&s;e have one of the Queen, <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> &s;ent Hor&s;es to their Lodging, for the ac|commodation of the Emba&s;&s;adours, and their Servants: it being the fa&s;hion of that Court, that the Emba&s;&s;adours ride to their fir&s;t Audience. And &s;o they rode, being attended by all their own Servants, and all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants who liv'd in the Town, together with many <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officers who were in the &s;ervice of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, all on Hor&s;e|back; &s;o that their Cavalcade appear'd very fair, all the Coaches of other <MILESTONE N="50"> Emba&s;&s;adours likewi&s;e following them. In this manner they came to the Court about ten of the Clock in the morning, being conducted by an Officer, who had been &s;ent to their Lodging, and rode with them to the Court.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="2770">
THROUGH &s;everal rooms, where there was only one Officer, who attended to open and &s;hut the doors, they came to the room next that where his Maje&s;ty was; where, after a little &s;tay, whil&s;t their Conductor went in and out, they found the King &s;tanding upright, with his back again&s;t the Wall, and the Grandees at a di&s;tance, in the &s;ame po&s;ture, again&s;t the Wall. When they had made their &s;everal re&s;pects, and came to the King, he lightly moved his hat, and bid them cover: the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> &s;poke only general things, <Q>&startq;of the confidence the King had in his Maje&s;ty's kindne&s;s, and that He believ'd his condition &s;uch, as that all the Kings of the World were concern'd to vindicate the wrong <MILESTONE N="10"> he &s;u&s;tain'd: that this was the fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;y he had &s;ent, relying more upon the honour of his Maje&s;ty's nature and genero&s;ity, than upon&endq; any other Prince;</Q> with di&s;cour&s;es of the &s;ame nature: then they pre|&s;ented their Credentials.</P>
<P>THE King expre&s;&s;ed a very tender Sen&s;e of our King's condition, and acknowledged <Q>&startq;that it concern'd all Kings to joyn together for the pu|ni&s;hment of &s;uch an impious Rebellion and Parricide; and if his own Affairs would permit it, he would be the fir&s;t that would undertake it; but that they could not but know how full his hands were; and whil&s;t he had &s;o powerful an Adver&s;ary to contend with, he could <MILESTONE N="20"> hardly defend him&s;elf; but that when there &s;hould be a Peace with&endq; <HI>France</HI> (which he de&s;ired) the King,</Q> his <HI>Sobrino</HI> (for &s;o he &s;till called the King, his Nephew) <Q>&startq;&s;hould find all he could expect from him; in the mean time he would be ready to do all that was in his power to|wards&endq; his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and relief.</Q> After the formal part was over, the King asked many que&s;tions, mo&s;t with reference to his Si&s;ter, the Queen of <HI>France;</HI> and di&s;cour&s;ed very intelligently of every thing; &s;o that his defects proceeded only from the lazine&s;s of his mind, not from any want of under&s;tanding; and he &s;eem'd then, when he was about eight and forty years of Age, to have great vigour of Body, having a clear <MILESTONE N="30"> ruddy complection; yet he had been accu&s;tom'd to feavours from his debauches with Women, by which he was much wa&s;ted.</P>
<P>FROM the King they were conducted to the Queen; who u&s;ed very few words, and &s;poke &s;o low that &s;he could &s;carce be heard; &s;he &s;tood, in the &s;ame manner the King did, again&s;t a Wall, and her Ladies on both &s;ides as the Grandees did; the <HI>In&s;anta</HI> at a little di&s;tance from her, to whom likewi&s;e they made a compliment from their Ma&s;ter. The Queen was then about eighteen years of Age, not tall, round faced, and inclined to be fat. The <HI>In&s;anta</HI> was much lower, as &s;he ought to be by her Age, but of a very lovely complection, without any help of Art, <MILESTONE N="40"> which every one el&s;e in the room, even the Queen her &s;elf, was be|holding to: and &s;he was then the fulle&s;t of Spirit and Wit of any Lady in <HI>Spain,</HI> which &s;he had not improv'd afterwards, when &s;he had more years upon her. Their Audience ended, they return'd; and at la&s;t they <NOTE PLACE="marg">They have an Hou&s;e a&s;&s;ign'd them.</NOTE> had a Hou&s;e provided for them in the <HI>Calle de Alcala,</HI> belonging to the Marquis of <HI>Villa Magna,</HI> to whom the King paid four hundred pounds &s;terling by the year.</P>
<P>THE Council of State at this time con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Medina de los Torres,</HI> Duke <HI>de Mounterey,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Ca&s;tille Roderigo,</HI> Marquis <HI>de Vall-Peri&s;o,</HI> the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;trilio,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Melo;</HI> there were no more re&s;iding in that Court then; the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> re&s;iding con&s;tantly at his Government of S^r <HI>Lucar,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Leganez</HI> being General again&s;t <HI>Portugal,</HI>
<PB N="260" REF="2780">
and &s;o remaining ad <HI>Badajoz,</HI> and coming &s;eldom to <HI>Madrid;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Arcos</HI> &s;tood confined to his Hou&s;e, &s;ince the defection of <HI>Na|ples</HI> when it was under his Government; and the <HI>Conde de Pignoranda</HI> was not yet come out of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis</HI> was as ab&s;olute a Favourite in the eyes of his Ma&s;ter, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Character of</HI> Don Lewis de Haro.</NOTE> had as entire a di&s;po&s;al of all his affections and faculties, as any Favou|rite of that Age: nor was any thing tran&s;acted at home, or abroad, but by His direction and determination: and yet of all the Favourites of that, or any other time, no Man ever did &s;o little alone, or &s;eem'd le&s;s to enjoy the delight and empire of a Favourite. In the mo&s;t ordi|nary <MILESTONE N="10"> occurrences, which, for the difficulty, required little deliberation, and in the nature of them required expedition, he would give no Order without formal con&s;ultation with the re&s;t of the Council; which hin|der'd di&s;patch, and made his parts the more &s;u&s;pected. He was Son of the Marquis of <HI>Carpio,</HI> who had Married the Si&s;ter of <HI>Olivarez,</HI> and had been put about the Per&s;on of the King, being about the &s;ame Age with his Maje&s;ty, and had &s;o grown up in his Affection, and was not thought to have been di&s;plea&s;ed at the di&s;grace of his Uncle, but rather to have contributed to it, though he did not &s;ucceed in the place of Fa|vourite in many years, nor &s;eem'd to be concern'd in any bu&s;ine&s;s till <MILESTONE N="20"> after the death of the then Queen, and was rather drawn into it by the violence of the King's Affection, who had a great kindne&s;s for his Per|&s;on, than by the Ambition of his own Nature, or any delight in bu&s;i|ne&s;s. His Education had not fitted him for it, and his natural parts were not &s;harp, yet his Indu&s;try was great, and the more commendable, becau&s;e his Nature had &s;ome repugnancy to it, and his Experience had &s;o fitted him for it, that he never &s;poke impertinently, but di&s;cour&s;ed rea&s;onably and weightily upon all Subjects. He was of a Melancholick complection; which, it may be, was the rea&s;on that he did not tru&s;t him&s;elf to him&s;elf, which was his defect. He &s;eem'd to be a very hone&s;t, <MILESTONE N="30"> and well natur'd Man, and did very rarely manife&s;t his power in Acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, or hard-heartedne&s;s; which made him grateful to mo&s;t particular Men, when he was hated enough by the generality. His port and grandeur was very much inferior to that of either of the <HI>French</HI> Cardinals, the la&s;t of which was favourite during His Admi|ni&s;tration. Nor did he affect Wealth as They did, not leaving a For|tune behind him much improv'd by his own Indu&s;try: yet it cannot be denied, that the Affairs of <HI>Spain</HI> declined more, in the time they were under His Government, than at any time before; and that le&s;s was done with the con&s;umption of &s;o much Money, than might have been expected. <MILESTONE N="40"> But it mu&s;t be likewi&s;e con&s;ider'd, that he enter'd upon that Admini&s;tra|tion in a very unhappy conjuncture, after the lo&s;s of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the defection in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> which made &s;uch a rent in that Crown, as would have required more than an ordinary States-man to have repaired, and make it flouri&s;h as before.</P>
<P>THE Emba&s;&s;adours had not been long at <HI>Madrid,</HI> when the <HI>Conde</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the</HI> Conde <HI>of</HI> Pignoran|da</NOTE> of <HI>Pignoranda</HI> return'd thither from his Negotiation in the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> He had been declared to be of the Council of State, after he had made that Peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> and was admitted to it a&s;&s;oon as he return'd. He was <HI>Conde</HI> in the right of his Wife only; and before <MILESTONE N="50"> being of a good Family, <HI>Don Diego de Brachamonte,</HI> and bred in the &s;tudy of the Law, was looked upon as a good Man of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o imployed in matters of greate&s;t Tru&s;t. He was indeed a Man of great
<PB N="261" REF="2790">
parts, and under&s;tood the Affairs of the world better than mo&s;t in that Court. He was proud to the height of his Nation, and retain'd too much of the Pedantry which he had brought with him from <HI>Salamanca.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as he return'd, according to the method of that Court upon great and &s;ucce&s;sful Employments, the Pre&s;ident&s;hip <HI>de los Ordines,</HI> an Office of great reputation, becoming void, it was the very next day conferr'd upon him. The Emba&s;&s;adours found no benefit by his Arrival, coming from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> which was throughly infected by <HI>Don Alonzo.</HI> The truth is, <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> who had no Affection for the King, upon the memory of &s;ome di&s;obligations when he fir&s;t came over into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> and liked well his imployment, and re&s;idence there, u&s;ed all the endeavours imaginable to have the King's condition thought to be irre|coverable and de&s;perate, and that therefore all civilities extended to|wards him were ca&s;t away, and would yield no fruit, and that the Com|mon-wealth was &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it could never be &s;haken. So that <HI>Spain</HI> thought only how to make a firm friend&s;hip there, and to forget that there ever Had been a King of <HI>England,</HI> in the confidence that there would be no more. And therefore when the Emba&s;&s;adours, after all Ce|remonies were over, had a private Audience of the King, and de&s;ired, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emba&s;&s;a|dours private Audience and Demands.</NOTE> <Q>&startq;that he would appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners, with whom they might treat <MILESTONE N="20"> about the renewing the Alliance between the two Crowns, which had been provided for by the la&s;t Treaty to be renew'd within &s;o many Months after the death of either King, and with whom they might likewi&s;e confer upon &s;uch relief in Armes, and Money, as his Catho|lick&endq; Maje&s;ty would think proper to &s;end to their Ma&s;ter into <HI>Ireland</HI></Q> (whither one of the Emba&s;&s;adours de&s;ired to ha&s;ten his Journey a&s;&s;oon as might be; and in that Memorial, which they then deliver'd to his Ca|tholick Maje&s;ty, they had de&s;ired likewi&s;e <Q>&startq;that he would write to&endq; <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> to di&s;po&s;e him to &s;ubmit to the King)</Q> they receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">The An&s;wer they rc$$$s.</NOTE> &s;hortly after an An&s;wer, &s;ent to them by <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Melo,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="30"> told them, <Q>&startq;that the King had &s;ent him to them, to confer with them upon the &s;ub&s;tance of their la&s;t Memorial. He &s;aid, the King did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to appoint any Committee to renew the la&s;t Treaty of Peace; which was &s;till in force, and might well be ob&s;erv'd between the two Nations; and that the renewing might be deferr'd till the&endq; times &s;hould mend;</Q> implying very little le&s;s than that when the King &s;hould be in <HI>England,</HI> it would be a fit time to renew the Alliance. He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he was ready to receive any Propo&s;itions from them, wherein they might more particularly &s;et down their de&s;ires, if they were ready&endq; to depart;</Q> and for writing to <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> (whom he called <HI>Don Eu|genio)</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> <Q>&startq;he had &s;o misbehaved him&s;elf towards his Catholick Maje&s;ty, by leaving his Service in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and tran&s;porting him&s;elf into <HI>Ire|land</HI> without his Licence, that his Maje&s;ty could not in honour write to him; but that he would take &s;uch care, that he &s;hould know it would be agreeable to his Maje&s;ty's good liking, that he betook him|&s;elf to the Service of the King of great <HI>Britain</HI> without re&s;erve; which&endq; he did believe would di&s;po&s;e him to it: which Method the Emba&s;&s;a|dours conceiv'd was propo&s;ed,</Q> becau&s;e they &s;hould believe that the <HI>Spa|niard</HI> had no hand in &s;ending him into that Kingdom, or in fomenting the Rebellion there; whereas at the &s;ame time <HI>Don Diego de la Torre</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> was with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> as Re&s;ident or Envoy from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>THIS An&s;wer was evidence enough to them, how little they were to expect from any avow'd friend&s;hip of that Crown, though they &s;till
<PB N="262" REF="2800">
thought they might be able to obtain &s;ome little favour in private, as Armes, and Ammunition, and a &s;mall &s;upply of Money for the King's Sub&s;i&s;tence, that could hardly be taken notice of. And therefore the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was de&s;ign'd by the King to attend him in <HI>Ireland,</HI> expected only to hear that he was arriv'd there, till when he could not pre&s;ent his Memorial &s;o particularly as was demand|ed, nor prepare him&s;elf for his Voyage thither: and &s;o they re&s;ted for &s;ome time, without giving the Court any farther trouble by Audiences.</P>
<P>Now whil&s;t they were in this impatient Expectation to hear from the King their Ma&s;ter, who yet remain'd at <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> by which they <MILESTONE N="10"> might take their own re&s;olutions, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came upon the coa&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>comes upon the coa&s;t of</HI> Spain.</NOTE> of <HI>Spain</HI> with the Fleet under his Command; which he had brought from <HI>Ireland;</HI> and had &s;ent a Letter on Shore to be &s;ent to the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer; which the Officer upon the place, &s;ent pre|&s;ently to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro;</HI> who, in the &s;ame moment, &s;ent it to him with a very civil &s;alutation. <Q>The Prince writ him word, &startq;that he had brought away all the Fleet from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that he had receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Letter to the Chancellor of the Exche|quer.</NOTE> an A&s;&s;urance from <HI>Portugal,</HI> that he &s;hould be very welcome thither; upon which he was re&s;olv'd, after he had attended &s;ome days to meet with any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships that might be prize, to go for <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and de|&s;ired <MILESTONE N="20"> him to procure Orders from the Court, that he might find a good reception in all the Ports of <HI>Spain,</HI> if his occa&s;ions brought him thi|ther.&endq;</Q> The Emba&s;&s;adours &s;ent immediately for an Audience to <HI>Don Lewis;</HI> who receiv'd them with open Armes, and another kind of Coun|tenance than he had ever done before. A Fleet of the King of <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of a Prince of the Blood, upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> at a Sea&s;on of the year when they expected the return of their Galeons from the Indies, made a great con&s;ternation among&s;t the People, and the Court receiv'd the News of it with di&s;order enough. All that the Emba&s;&s;adours asked, was granted without hae&s;itation; and Letters were <MILESTONE N="30"> di&s;patched away that very night (Copies whereof were &s;ent to the Em|ba&s;&s;adours) by &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es, to all the Governours of the Ports, and other Officers, for the good reception of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> or any Ships under his Command, if they came into any of the Ports; and for the furni&s;hing them with any Provi&s;ions they &s;hould &s;tand in need of, with as many friendly Clau&s;es as could have been in&s;erted if the King had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his whole Empire: &s;o great an influence a lit|tle appearance of Power had upon their Spirits; and the Emba&s;&s;adours found they liv'd in another kind of Air than they had done, and receiv'd every day vi&s;its and care&s;&s;es from the Court, and from tho&s;e in Au|thority. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>

<P>BUT as the&s;e Orders were but faintly given, &s;o they were more &s;lowly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The chief Com|mander of the Parliament's Fleet comes o$ the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Coa&s;t.</HI></NOTE> executed; and a &s;tronger Fleet &s;et out by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> then appear'd upon the Coa&s;t, which came into the road of S^r <HI>Andero's;</HI> from whence the Commander in chief writ a very in&s;olent Letter in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> <Q>wherein he requir'd, &startq;that none of tho&s;e Ships <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Letter to the King of</HI> Spain.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> under the Command of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> which had revolted from the Parliament, and were in Rebellion again&s;t it, might be receiv'd into any of the Ports of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that tho&s;e Ships which were in the Ports of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> might be deliver'd to him, and the Ordnance and tackling of the other which were wreck'd, might be carefully kept, and be deliver'd to &s;uch Per&s;on as &s;hould be authoriz'd to receive the&endq; &s;ame by the Common-wealth of <HI>England;</HI></Q> to whom they belong'd: and concluded, <Q>&startq;that as the Common-wealth of <HI>England</HI> was willing to live in Amity, and good Intelligence with his Catholick Maje&s;ty, &s;o they knew very well how to do them&s;elves right for any injury,&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> or di&s;courte&s;y, which they &s;hould &s;u&s;tain.</Q></P>
<P>THIS imperious &s;tyle made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon the Court, that all the importunity the Emba&s;&s;adours could u&s;e, could get nothing done at <HI>Cartagena</HI> in pur&s;uance of the Orders they had &s;ent from the Court; but the poor Men were, after long attendance, forced to tran&s;port them&s;elves as they were able; and two or three hundred of them march'd over land, and were compell'd to li&s;t them&s;elves in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ervice at land; where they, for the mo&s;t part, peri&s;h'd; care being in the mean time taken, that the Parliament Fleet &s;hould be receiv'd in all places, with all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of re&s;pect and kindne&s;s; and the King <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ent a Ring of the value of fifteen hundred pounds to the Commander. In this Triumph he &s;ail'd from thence into <HI>Portugal,</HI> and dropped his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He &s;ails into the River of</HI> Lisbon.</NOTE> Anchors in the River of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> at a very &s;mall di&s;tance from the Fleet of Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> and &s;uffer'd not any Ship to enter into that River; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Requires Prince</HI> Ru|pert<HI>'s Fleet to be delt|ver'd up.</HI></NOTE> but denounced War again&s;t that Kingdom, if that Fleet were not pre|&s;ently deliver'd up into his hands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueze</HI> had receiv'd Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> very civilly, bought all the Prizes he had brought thither, gave him the free u&s;e of all their Ports, and &s;urni&s;h'd him with all things he &s;tood in need of. The Queen, and the Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> then living, who was a young Man of great <MILESTONE N="40"> hope and courage, made great profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip to our King, and of a de&s;ire to a&s;&s;i&s;t him by all the ways and means which could be propo&s;ed to them. But when their river was block'd up, their Ships taken, and the whole Kingdom upon the matter be&s;ieged by the Parlia|ment Fleet, of which they knew the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would quickly make u&s;e, the Council was a&s;toni&s;h'd, and knew not what to do: their free trade with <HI>England</HI> was not only their profit, but their reputation; and, if they &s;hould be depriv'd of that, they &s;hould not be able to pre&s;erve it any where el&s;e; which would put the whole Kingdom into a &s;lame; and therefore they be&s;ought their King, that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> might be <MILESTONE N="50"> de&s;ir'd to leave the river, and to carry his Fleet from thence; which was not po&s;&s;ible for him to do without fighting with the Enemy, to whom he was much inferior in &s;trength of Shipping, and number of Men, by the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tain'd at <HI>Cartagena.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="2820">
THE Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> had &s;o great indignation at this overture made by the Council, that he declar'd <Q>&startq;he would have all the Ships in the Port made ready, and would him&s;elf go on board, and joyn with&endq; Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI></Q> and fight the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and drive them from thence: and he manife&s;ted a great de&s;ire to do &s;o; but the Council prevaild with the Queen not to con&s;ent to that. So in the end, after &s;ome Months &s;tay there, and the Fleet being fully &s;upplied with whatever it &s;tood in need of, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary, upon the a&s;&s;urance the <HI>Por|tugueze</HI> gave him that the other Fleet &s;hould not follow him till after two tides, to &s;et &s;ail and leave that Kingdom; which he did with &s;o full <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>e&s;capes out of the River of</HI> Lisbon <HI>with his Fleet.</HI></NOTE> a gale, that the Parliament's Commander, after &s;o long a &s;tay, found it to no purpo&s;e to follow him; but took full vengeance upon <HI>Portugal</HI> for re&s;cuing his Prey from him; until they were compell'd, after great &s;ufferings, to purcha&s;e their peace from <HI>Cromwell</HI> upon very hard con|ditions.</P>
<P>IT &s;eem'd no good &s;ign to the Emba&s;&s;adours, that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had left <HI>Ireland;</HI> where there were &s;o many good Ports, and where the Fleet <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The affairs of</HI> Ireland <HI>at this time.</HI></NOTE> had been &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the carrying on his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. But, in a &s;hort time after, they receiv'd adverti&s;ement, <Q>&startq;that the King had laid&endq; a&s;ide his purpo&s;e of going thither, and had taken new re&s;olutions.</Q> Be|fore <MILESTONE N="$$"> the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> could draw his Army together, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had be&s;ieged <HI>Tredagh:</HI> and though the Garri&s;on was &s;o &s;trong in point of number, and that number of &s;o choice Men, that they could wi&s;h for nothing more than that the Enemy would attempt to take them by &s;torm, the very next day after he came before the Town he gave a general A&s;&s;ault, and was beaten off with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. But, after a day more, he a&s;&s;aulted it again in two places, with &s;o much courage, that he enter'd in both; and though the Governour and &s;ome of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tredagh <HI>ta|ken by &s;torm.</HI></NOTE> chief Officers retir'd in di&s;order into a Fort, where they hoped to have mad conditions, a panick fear &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Soldiers, that they threw <MILESTONE N="30"> down their Arms upon a general offer of Quarter; &s;o that the Enemy enter'd the works without re&s;i&s;tance, and put every Man, Governour, Officer, and Soldier, to the Sword; and the whole Army being enter'd the Town, they executed all manner of cruelty, and put every Man that related to the Garri&s;on, and all the Citizens who were <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> Man, Woman, and Child, to the Sword; and there being three or four Offi|cers of Name, and of good families, who had found &s;ome way, by the humanity of &s;ome Soldiers of the Enemy, to conceal them&s;elves for four or five days, being afterwards di&s;cover'd they were butcher'd in cold blood. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THIS in&s;upportable lo&s;s took away all hopes from the Marquis of <HI>Or|mond</HI> of drawing an Army &s;trong enough, and re&s;olute enough, toge|ther, to meet <HI>Cromwell</HI> in the field, during the Summer, which was drawing to an end; and obliged him to retire into tho&s;e Quarters, where, in re&s;pect of the &s;trong Pa&s;&s;es, he might be &s;ecure, and from whence he might attempt upon the Enemy. <HI>Cromwell</HI> in the mean time took no re&s;t, but having made him&s;elf terrible by that exce&s;s of rigour and cruelty, march'd into <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> again&s;t the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>marches into</HI> Mun&s;ter</NOTE> Body of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> which was under His Command. Here he defied For|tune again; and march'd &s;o far out of the places devoted to him, and <MILESTONE N="50"> from whence he had any rea&s;onable hope to receive &s;upplies, that he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been &s;tarv'd, and could not have retir'd, all the Bridges over which he had pa&s;s'd being broken down, if the City of

<P>THOUGH Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and the other <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords, who remain'd in <HI>Holland</HI> when the King came into <HI>France,</HI> dur&s;t not return into their own Country, yet they held Intelli|gence with their Party there. And though the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> had the &s;ole power, yet he could not extingui&s;h the impatient de&s;ire of that whole Nation, to have their King come to them. And every day pro|duced in&s;tances enough, which inform'd him, how the affections of the <MILESTONE N="20"> People were generally di&s;po&s;ed, and upon how &s;lippery ground him&s;elf &s;tood, if he were not &s;upported by the King; and that the Government, he was then po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, could not be la&s;ting, except he had another force to defend him, than that of his own Nation. And he dur&s;t not receive any from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who would willingly have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, for fear of being entirely de&s;erted by all his Friends, who had been &s;till firm to him. Hereupon he thought of drawing the King into <HI>Scotland,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle <HI>de&s;igns de&s;igns to in|vite the King into</HI> Scotland:</NOTE> and keeping the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction from entring with him, by the &s;entence that was already again&s;t them, and to oblige the King to &s;ub|mit to the Covenant, and all tho&s;e other obligations which were at <MILESTONE N="30"> that time e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and if his Maje&s;ty would put him&s;elf into his hands upon tho&s;e conditions, he &s;hould be &s;ure to keep the power in him&s;elf under the King's name, and might rea&s;onably hope that <HI>Crom|well,</HI> who made no pretence to <HI>Scotland,</HI> might be well enough plea&s;ed that his Maje&s;ty might remain there under His Government, and A&s;|&s;urance, that he &s;hould not give <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> any di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>UPON this pre&s;umption, he wi&s;h'd the Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Provides, that a Me&s;&s;age be &s;ent to his Ma|je&s;ty to</HI> Jer&s;ey <HI>upon the old Conditions.</HI></NOTE> Committee of the Parliament in whom the Authority was ve&s;ted, to &s;end again to the King (who, they thought, by this time, might be weary of <HI>Jer&s;ey)</HI> to invite him to come to them upon the old condi|tions; <MILESTONE N="40"> and by gratifying them in this particular, which all the People did &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire, he renew'd all the &s;olemn obligations they had been before bound in, never to admit the King to come among&s;t them, but upon his fir&s;t &s;ubmitting to, and performing all tho&s;e condi|tions. All things being thus &s;etled, and agreed, they &s;ent a Gentleman with Letters into <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> to invite his Maje&s;ty again to come into his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not without a rude in&s;inuation that it was the la&s;t invitation he &s;hould receive. The <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords, who are men|tion'd before to be then in <HI>Holland,</HI> were glad of this advance; and be|liev'd that if the King were there, they &s;hould ea&s;ily find the way home <MILESTONE N="50"> again. And therefore they prevail'd with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to write very earne&s;tly to the King, and to recommend it to the Queen; and them&s;elves made great in&s;tance to the Queen, with whom they had much credit, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the King would not lo&s;e this opportunity to im|prove

his condition.</Q> No body pre&s;um'd to advi&s;e him to &s;ubmit to All that was propos'd; and yet it was evident, that if he did not &s;ubmit to All, he could have the benefit of none; but <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould make &s;uch an An&s;wer as might engage the <HI>Scots</HI> in a Treaty, for the King's better information, and &s;atisfaction in &s;ome particulars; which being done,&endq; he &s;hould imply a purpo&s;e to tran&s;port his Per&s;on thither.</Q></P>
<P>THE Spring was now coming on, and though <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> was a conve|nient place to retire to, in order to con&s;ider what was next to be done, yet it was not a place to re&s;ide in, nor would be longer &s;afe, than whil&s;t the Parliament had &s;o much el&s;e to do, that it could not &s;pare where|withal to reduce it. The de&s;ign for <HI>Ireland</HI> was at an end, and the de|&s;pair of being welcome in any other place, compell'd the King to think better of <HI>Scotland:</HI> and &s;o, according to the advice he had receiv'd, he return'd an An&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Scotland,</HI> <Q>&startq;that there were <NOTE PLACE="marg"><Q><HI>The King's an|&s;wer, &startq;that he would have a Trea|ty with them&endq; in</HI> Holland.</Q></NOTE> many particulars contain'd in the Propo&s;itions which he did not un|der&s;tand, and which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to be advi&s;ed in; and in order thereunto, and that he might be well inform'd and in&s;tructed in what &s;o nearly concern'd him, he re&s;olv'd, by &s;uch a time, which was &s;et down, to find him&s;elf in <HI>Holland;</HI> where he de&s;ir'd to meet &s;uch Per&s;ons as his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> would &s;end to him, and to <MILESTONE N="$$"> confer, and treat, and agree with tho&s;e upon all things that might give his Subjects of that Kingdom &s;atisfaction; which his Maje&s;ty did&endq; very much de&s;ire to do.</Q></P>
<P>THE Queen had &s;o good an opinion of many of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords, and &s;o ill a one of many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who were about the King (in truth, &s;he had &s;o entire a de&s;pair of all other ways) that &s;he was very de&s;irous that the overtures from <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be hearken'd to, and embraced: be&s;ides that &s;he found her Authority was not &s;o great with the King, as &s;he expected, &s;he &s;aw no po&s;&s;ibility of their being long to|gether: She knew well that the Court of <HI>France,</HI> that grew every day <MILESTONE N="30"> into a clo&s;er corre&s;pondence with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> would not endure that the King &s;hould make his Re&s;idence in any part of that Kingdom, and &s;o &s;horten'd the A&s;&s;ignations which they had made for her own &s;upport, that &s;he was at no ea&s;e, and begun to think of di&s;&s;olving her own Fa|mily, and of her own retiring into a Mona&s;tery; which from that time &s;he practi&s;ed by degrees: and, no doubt, that con&s;ideration which made mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon the King, as it had done upon his Father, and ter|rified him mo&s;t from complying with the <HI>Scot</HI>'s demands, which was the alteration it would make in Religion, and the Government of the Church, &s;eem'd not to Her of moment enough to reject the other con|veniencies; <MILESTONE N="$$"> nor did &s;he prefer the order, and decency of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before the &s;ordidne&s;s of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but thought it the be&s;t expedient to advance her own Religion, that the latter &s;hould triumph over the former. She therefore writ earne&s;tly to the King her Son, <Q>&startq;that he would entertain this motion from <HI>Scotland,</HI> as his only <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen ad|vi&s;es the King to agree with th$</HI> Scots <HI>upon their Terms.</HI></NOTE> refuge; and that he would invite Commi&s;&s;ioners to meet him in <HI>Hol|land,&endq;</HI> in &s;uch a place as the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;hould advi&s;e;</Q> and de|&s;ir'd that, <Q>&startq;in his pa&s;&s;age thither, he would appoint &s;ome place where her Maje&s;ty would meet him; that they might &s;pend &s;ome days toge|ther&endq; in con&s;ultation upon what might concern them joyntly.</Q> In all <MILESTONE N="50"> which his Maje&s;ty complying, the City of <HI>Beauvais</HI> in <HI>Picardy</HI> was ap|pointed for the interview; where both their Maje&s;ties met, and con|ver&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Maje|&s;ties meet at</HI> Beauvais.</NOTE> together three or fourdays; and then the Queen return'd to <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> and the King pa&s;s'd through <HI>Flanders</HI> to <HI>Breda;</HI> which the Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Breda.</NOTE>
<PB N="267" REF="2850">
of <HI>Orange</HI> thought to be the fitte&s;t place for the Treaty, the States having no mind that the King &s;hould come any more to the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners came to <HI>Breda</HI> with the very &s;ame Pro|po&s;itions <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Scoti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners come to</HI> Breda; <HI>and the terms they bring.</HI></NOTE> which had been formerly &s;ent, and without the lea&s;t mitiga|tion, and as po&s;itive an exception to Per&s;ons: &s;o that if the King &s;hould incline to go thither, he mu&s;t go without any one Chaplain of his own: there were Mini&s;ters &s;ent from <HI>Scotland</HI> to attend, and to in&s;truct him. His Maje&s;ty mu&s;t not carry with him any one Coun&s;ellor, nor any Per|&s;on who had ever &s;erv'd his Father in the War again&s;t the Parliament, without taking the Covenant. And, that no body might have cau&s;e to <MILESTONE N="10"> complain, if they did go thither, that they were wor&s;e treated than they had rea&s;on to expect, the King him&s;elf, and all who &s;hould attend upon him, were fir&s;t to &s;ign the Covenant before they &s;hould be admitted to en|ter into the Kingdom. Very fair warning indeed: nor could any Man ju&s;tly except again&s;t any thing that was afterwards done to him.</P>
<P>HERE was no great Argument for con&s;ultation: no Man had &s;o ill an under&s;tanding, as not to di&s;cern the violence that was offer'd to ho|nour, ju&s;tice, and con&s;cience; yet whoever objected again&s;t what was propo&s;ed, upon any of tho&s;e con&s;iderations, was looked upon as a Party, becau&s;e he him&s;elf could not be &s;uffer'd to attend the King. It was <MILESTONE N="20"> thought to be of great Weight, that they who di&s;&s;waded the King from going into <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon tho&s;e rude and barbarous terms, could not propo&s;e any thing el&s;e for him to do, nor any place where he might &s;e|curely repo&s;e him&s;elf, with any hope of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: a very &s;ad State for a Prince to be reduced to, and which made it manife&s;t enough, that the Kings of the Earth are not &s;uch a Body as is &s;en&s;ible of the Indignity, and Outrage, that is offer'd to any Member of it. The <HI>Scoti&s;h Hamil|tonian</HI> Lords were thought to be the mo&s;t competent Coun&s;ellors, &s;ince They, by going, were to be expo&s;ed to great rigour, and to undergo the &s;evere&s;t part of all Cen&s;ures. They could not &s;it in the Parliament, <MILESTONE N="30"> nor in the Council, and knew well that they &s;hould not be &s;uffer'd to be about the Per&s;on of the King: yet all the&s;e re&s;olv'd to wait upon him, and per&s;waded him to believe, <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence would di&s;&s;i|pate tho&s;e Clouds; and that a little time would produce many altera|tions,&endq; which could not be pre&s;ently effected.</Q> For his Maje&s;ty's &s;igning the Covenant, <Q>&startq;he &s;hould tell the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that he would defer it till he came thither, that he might think better of it; and that if then the Kirk &s;hould pre&s;s it upon him, he would give them &s;ati&s;|faction.&endq;</Q> And they were confident, <Q>&startq;that after he &s;hould be there, he &s;hould be no more importuned in it, but that even the Church-men&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> them&s;elves, would contend to make them&s;elves gracious to him.</Q></P>
<P>THIS kind of Argumentation wrought much with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but more with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had waited upon the King from the time of his Adventure with the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> (again&s;t who&s;e Per&s;on there was no exception) and with <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and <HI>Wentworth</HI> (who re&s;olv'd to go with his Maje&s;ty, and would &s;ubmit to any conditions, which would be required of them) and with others about the King, who could not dige&s;t the Covenant; yet the hope that it would not be required from them, and the many promi&s;es tho&s;e <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords made to them, who were like to grow into Authority again <MILESTONE N="$0"> when they &s;hould be once in their native Air and upon their own Soyl, prevailed with them to u&s;e all their credit with the King to embark him&s;elf, and try how propitious fortune would be to him in <HI>Scotland.</HI> In the end, a &s;aint hope in that, and a &s;trong de&s;pair of any other ex|pedient,

<P>THERE were two very &s;trong Arguments, which made deep impre&s;|&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arguments of &s;ome Lords again&s;t the King's going to</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> on tho&s;e Lords who very vehemently di&s;&s;waded, and ever prote&s;ted again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's going for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which, as it often falls out in matters of the highe&s;t importance, they could not make u&s;e of to convert others, e&s;pecially in the place and company in which they were to urge them. <Q>The fir&s;t, &startq;that the Expedition of Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> the <MILESTONE N="10"> year before, with an Army as numerous, and much better furni&s;h'd, and provided, than <HI>Scotland</HI> could in many years be again enabled to &s;end out, made it manife&s;t enough, how little that Nation, how united&endq; &s;oever, could prevail again&s;t the force of <HI>England:</HI></Q> the other, <Q>&startq;that the whole, and ab&s;olute power of <HI>Scotland</HI> being, at that time, con|fe&s;&s;edly ve&s;ted in the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> it might rea&s;onably be fear'd, and expected, that the King &s;hould no &s;ooner arrive there, and the lea&s;t appearance be di&s;cover'd of &s;uch re&s;olutions, or alterations in the Affections of the People, upon which the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction wholely and &s;olely depended, but <HI>Argyle</HI> would immediately deliver up the <MILESTONE N="20"> Per&s;on of the King into the hands of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance He would willingly give, make that Kingdom tributary or &s;ub&s;ervient to him, whil&s;t the King remain'd his Pri&s;oner, and <HI>Argyle</HI> continued&endq; his Vice-gerent in <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> No doubt the&s;e objections had too much weight in them not to be thought worthy of Apprehen&s;ion, by many Men, who were not blinded with pa&s;&s;ion, or amazed with de&s;pair: and though they were not able to give any other Coun&s;el, what Cour&s;e the King might &s;teer with rea&s;onable hope and &s;ecurity, they might yet warrantably di&s;&s;wade his expo&s;ing him&s;elf to &s;o many vi&s;ible dangers as that Voyage was &s;ubject to both at Sea and Land; and might prudently <MILESTONE N="30"> believe, that the enjoying the empty title of King, in what ob&s;curity &s;oever, in any part of the world, was to be preferr'd before the empty name of King in any of his own Dominions; which was the be&s;t, that could rea&s;onably be expected from the conditions which were impo&s;ed upon him; to which he was compelled to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>DURING this time, when the Emba&s;&s;adours who were in <HI>Spain,</HI> ex|pected <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The two Em|ba&s;&s;adours in</HI> Spam <HI>had Or|der from the King to &s;tay where they were.</HI></NOTE> every day to hear of his Maje&s;ty's being arriv'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had thereupon importuned that Court for a di&s;patch, the King gave them notice of this his re&s;olution, and directed them <Q>&startq;to remain where&endq; they were, till he could better judge of his own Fortune.</Q> They were <MILESTONE N="40"> extremely troubled, both of them having allways had a &s;trong aver&s;ion that the King &s;hould ever venture him&s;elf in the hands of that Party of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation, which had treated his Father &s;o perfidiou&s;ly. And they were now nece&s;&s;itated to &s;tay there, where they had receiv'd &s;o lit|tle Encouragement, and had no rea&s;on to expect more. They therefore re&s;olv'd to &s;et the be&s;t face they could upon it, and de&s;ired an Audience from the King: in which they told his Catholick Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They acquaint the King of</HI> Spain <HI>with their Ma&s;ter's re&s;olution for</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> had receiv'd Letters from the King their Ma&s;ter; who commanded them to inform his Maje&s;ty, who, he knew well, would be glad to hear of any good fortune that befel him, that it had now plea&s;ed God <MILESTONE N="50"> to work &s;o far upon the hearts and affections of his Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they had given over all tho&s;e Factions and Animo&s;ities, which had heretofore divided them, and made them rather In&s;truments of mi&s;chiefs, than benefit to his ble&s;&s;ed Father, and to him&s;elf: that they

were now &s;en&s;ible of all tho&s;e Mi&s;carriages, and had &s;ent unanimou&s;ly to intreat his Maje&s;ty to come into that Kingdom, and to take them all into his Protection; with which his Maje&s;ty was &s;o well &s;atisfied, that he had laid a&s;ide the thought of tran&s;porting him&s;elf into <HI>Ire|land;</HI> which he had intended to do; and was gone into <HI>Scotland;</HI> where the Kingdom was entirely at his devotion, and from whence he could vi&s;it <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> as he found it mo&s;t convenient: and that he had rea&s;on to believe, that his friends in either of the Kingdoms, would quickly appear in Armes, when they were &s;ure to be &s;o power|fully&endq; a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and &s;econded.</Q> And they &s;aid, <Q>&startq;they would, from time&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> to time, inform his Maje&s;ty of the good &s;ucce&s;s that &s;hould fall out.</Q> The King profe&s;&s;ed <Q>&startq;to be very glad of this good News; and that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King of</HI> Spain<HI>'s An|&s;wer to them.</HI></NOTE> &s;hould a&s;&s;ure the King their Ma&s;ter, that he would be allways ready to make all the demon&s;tration of a Brotherly Affection that the ill con|dition of his own Affairs would permit, and that, if it plea&s;ed God to give a Peace to the two Crowns, the world &s;hould &s;ee how forward he would be to revenge the wrong, and indignity the King of great <HI>Bri|tain&endq;</HI> had undergone.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the Emba&s;&s;adours them&s;elves were afflicted with the News of his Maje&s;ty's being gone for <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the too much knowledge <MILESTONE N="20"> they had of the treachery of that Faction there, yet they found his Ma|je&s;ty was much the more e&s;teem'd in this Court by it. He was before looked upon as being di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and di&s;inherited of all his Dominions, as if he had no more Subjects than tho&s;e few who were bani&s;h'd with him, and that there was an entire defection in all the re&s;t. But now that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one whole Kingdom, in which no Man appear'd in Armes again&s;t him, a Kingdom which had been famous for many war|like Actions, and which allways bred a very warlike People, which had borne good parts in all the Wars of <HI>Europe</HI> in this Age, and had been celebrated in them, was a happy advance, and admini&s;tred rea&s;onable <MILESTONE N="30"> hope that he might be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the other two Kingdoms, in one of which he was thought to have a good, and was known to have a nu|merous Army on Foot at that very time: &s;o that the Emba&s;&s;adours were much better look'd upon than they had been; and when they made any complaints of injuries done to any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants who liv'd in the Ports of <HI>Spain,</HI> as they had &s;ometimes occa&s;ion to do, upon Taxes and Impo&s;itions laid upon them, contrary to the Treaties which had been made, and which they &s;aid were &s;till in force, they were heard with re&s;pect; the Merchants were reliev'd; and many favours were done to particular Per&s;ons upon their de&s;ires and interpo&s;ition: &s;o that <MILESTONE N="40"> they were not &s;o much out of Countenance as they had been, and all Men &s;poke with more freedom and dete&s;tation again&s;t the Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> and the barbarity thereof, than they had u&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>THERE fell out at this time, and before the King left <HI>Holland,</HI> an accident of &s;uch a prodigious nature, that, if Providence had not, for the reproach of <HI>Scotland,</HI> determin'd that the King &s;hould once more make experiment of the courage and fidelity of that Nation, could not but have diverted his Maje&s;ty from that Northern Expedition; which, how un&s;ecure &s;oever it appear'd to be for the King, was prede&s;tinated for a greater cha&s;ti&s;ement and mortification of that People, as it &s;hortly <MILESTONE N="50"> after prov'd to be. When the King had left <HI>Holland,</HI> the Summer be|fore, and intended only to make <HI>France</HI> his way to <HI>Ireland,</HI> he had given his Commi&s;&s;ion to the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> to gather &s;uch a force together, as by the help of the Northern Princes he might be
<PB N="270" REF="2880">
enabled to do. Upon which the Marquis, who was naturally full of great thoughts, and confident of Succe&s;s, &s;ent &s;everal Officers who had &s;erv'd in <HI>Germany,</HI> and promi&s;ed very much, to draw &s;uch Troops to|gether as they &s;hould be enabled to do, and him&s;elf, with a great train of Officers and Servants, went for <HI>Hamburg;</HI> which he appointed for <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Mountro&s;e <HI>goes for</HI> Ham|burg <HI>to &s;olli|cite for Forces.</HI></NOTE> the Rendezvous for all the&s;e Troops, and from whence he could in the mean time vi&s;it &s;uch Courts of the Neighbour Princes and States, as he &s;hould be encouraged to do; and keep &s;uch Intelligence with his Friends in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as &s;hould provide for his reception.</P>
<P>BESIDES the hopes and encouragement he had receiv'd from the <MILESTONE N="10"> Emba&s;&s;adour <HI>Wolfelte,</HI> to expect good Supplies in <HI>Denmark,</HI> there were many Officers of good name and account in <HI>Sweden,</HI> of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Na|tion, who were grown rich, and liv'd in plenty in that Kingdom. With the principal of Them, the Marquis had held corre&s;pondence; who un|dertook, as well for others as for them&s;elves, <Q>&startq;that if the Marquis en|gaged him&s;elf in the King's Service in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they&endq; would give him notable A&s;&s;i&s;tance in Money, Armes, and Men.</Q> In a word, he &s;ent, or went in Per&s;on, to both tho&s;e Kingdoms; where he found the performance very di&s;proportionable to their promi&s;es. Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> had receiv'd an Agent from <HI>England</HI> with wonderful civility <MILESTONE N="20"> and grace, and expre&s;s'd a great e&s;teem of the Per&s;on of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as a Man of glorious Atchievements; and before &s;he re&s;ign'd the Crown, which &s;he in few years after did, &s;he engaged it in a fa&s;t Alliance with the new Common-wealth, and di&s;po&s;ed her Succe&s;&s;our to look upon it as a nece&s;&s;ary Support to his Crown. In <HI>Denmark,</HI> the Marquis found good Wi&s;hes enough, a hearty dete&s;tation of all the Villanies which had been acted in <HI>England,</HI> and as hearty wi&s;hes for the advancement and pro&s;perity of the King's Affairs; but the Kingdom it &s;elf was very poor, and full of di&s;content, the King not &s;o much e&s;teem'd, becau&s;e not &s;o much fear'd as his Father had been, and he had been compelled to make <MILESTONE N="30"> many unrea&s;onable Conce&s;&s;ions to <HI>Holland,</HI> that he might have A&s;|&s;i&s;tance from them, to protect him from tho&s;e a&s;&s;aults and inva&s;ions which were threaten'd from <HI>Sweden.</HI> So that the Marquis was obliged to return to <HI>Hamburg,</HI> with very &s;mall Supplies, from either or both tho&s;e King|doms: and there he receiv'd no better account from tho&s;e Officers who had been &s;ent into <HI>Germany.</HI> His de&s;ign had allways been to Land in the High-lands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the Winter Sea&s;on &s;hould be over, both for the &s;afety of his imbarkation, and that he might have time to draw tho&s;e People together, who, he knew, would be willing to repair to him, before it &s;hould be known at <HI>Edenborough</HI> that he was landed in the <MILESTONE N="40"> Kingdom. He had, by frequent Me&s;&s;ages, kept a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e principal heads of the Clans who were mo&s;t powerful in the High-lands, and were of known, or un&s;u&s;pected Affection to the King, and adverti&s;ed them of all his motions and de&s;igns. And by them ac|quainted tho&s;e of the Low-lands of all his re&s;olutions; who had pro|mi&s;ed, upon the fir&s;t notice of his arrival, to re&s;ort with all their Friends and Followers to him.</P>
<P>WHETHER the&s;e Men did really believe, that their own &s;trength would be &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue their Enemies, who were grown generally odious, or thought the bringing over Troops of Foreigners would le&s;&s;en <MILESTONE N="50"> the numbers, and affections of the Natives, they did write very earne&s;tly to the Marquis, <Q>&startq;to ha&s;ten his coming over with Officers, Armes, and&endq; Ammunition;</Q> for which he &s;hould find hands enough; and gave him notice, <Q>&startq;that the Committee of E&s;tates at <HI>Edenborough</HI> had &s;ent
<PB N="271" REF="2890">
again to the King to come over to them; and that the People were &s;o impatient for his pre&s;ence, that <HI>Argyle</HI> was compell'd to con&s;ent to the&endq; Invitation.</Q> It is very probable that this made the greate&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon him. He knew very well how few Per&s;ons there were about the King, who were like to continue firm in tho&s;e principles, which could only confirm his Maje&s;ty in his former re&s;olutions again&s;t the per&s;wa|&s;ions, and importunities of many others, who knew how to repre&s;ent to him the de&s;peratene&s;s of his condition any other way, than by re|pairing into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon any conditions. <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> knew, that of the two Factions there, which were not like to be reconciled, each of <MILESTONE N="10"> them were equally his implacable Enemies; &s;o that which &s;oever pre|vail'd, He &s;hould be &s;till in the &s;ame State, the whole Kirk, of what temper &s;oever, being alike malicious to Him; and hearing likewi&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive misfortunes in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he concluded, the King would not tru&s;t him&s;elf there. Therefore upon the whole, and concluding that all his hopes from <HI>Germany</HI> and tho&s;e Northern Princes would not en|crea&s;e the &s;trength he had already, he cau&s;ed, in the depth of the Win|ter, tho&s;e Soldiers he had drawn together, which did not amount to above five hundred, to be imbark'd, and &s;ent Officers with them, who knew the Country, with directions that they &s;hould land in &s;uch a place <MILESTONE N="20"> in the High-lands, and remain there, as they might well do, till he came to them, or &s;ent them Orders. And then in another Ve&s;&s;el mann'd by People well known to him, and commanded by a Captain very faith|ful to the King, and who was well acquainted with that Coa&s;t, he em|bark'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountro&s;e <HI>embarks for</HI> Scotland; <HI>lands there in</HI> March 1649.</NOTE> him&s;elf, and near one hundred Officers, and landed in another Creek, not far from the other place, whither his Soldiers were directed. And both the one and the other party were &s;et &s;afely on &s;hore in the places they de&s;ign'd; from whence the Marquis him&s;elf with &s;ome Ser|vants, and Officers, repair'd pre&s;ently to the Hou&s;e of a Gentleman of Quality, with whom he had corre&s;ponded, who expected him; by whom <MILESTONE N="30"> he was well receiv'd, and thought him&s;elf to be in &s;ecurity till he might put his Affairs in &s;ome method: and therefore order'd his other &s;mall Troops to contain them&s;elves in tho&s;e uncouth Quarters, in which they were, and where he thought they were not like to be di&s;turb'd by the vi&s;itation of any Enemy.</P>
<P>AFTER he had &s;tay'd there a &s;hort time, it being in <HI>March</HI> about the end of the year 1649, he quickly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of an old Ca&s;tle; which, in re&s;pect of the &s;ituation in a Country &s;o impo&s;&s;ible for any Army to march in, he thought &s;trong enough for his purpo&s;e: thither he convey'd the Arms, Ammunition, and Troops, which he had brought <MILESTONE N="40"> with him. And then he publi&s;h'd his Declaration, <Q>&startq;that he came with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Publi&s;hes his Declaration</NOTE> the King's Commi&s;&s;ion, to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e his good Subjects, and to pre|&s;erve them from oppre&s;&s;ion: that he did not intend to give any in|terruption to the Treaty that he heard was enter'd into with his Ma|je&s;ty; but, on the contrary, hoped that his being in the head of an Army, how &s;mall &s;oever, that was faithful to the King, might ad|vance the &s;ame. However, he had given &s;ufficient proof in his former Actions, that if any Agreement were made with the King, upon the fir&s;t Order from his Maje&s;ty, he &s;hould lay down his Arms, and di&s;po&s;e&endq; him&s;elf according to his Maje&s;ty's good plea&s;ure.</Q> The&s;e Declarations <MILESTONE N="50"> he &s;ent to his Friends to be &s;catter'd by them, and di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the People, as they could be able. He writ likewi&s;e to tho&s;e of the Nobility, and the heads of the &s;everal Clans, <Q>&startq;to draw &s;uch &s;orces to|gether,&endq; as they thought nece&s;&s;ary to joyn with him;</Q> and he receiv'd
<PB N="272" REF="2900">
An&s;wers from many of them, by which they de&s;ir'd him <Q>&startq;to advance more&endq; into the Land</Q> (for he was yet in the remote&s;t parts of <HI>Cathne&s;s)</HI> and a&s;&s;ur'd him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they would meet him with good Numbers;</Q> and they did pre|pare &s;o to do, &s;ome really; and others, with a purpo&s;e to betray him.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate &s;tood the Affair in the end of the year 1649: but be|cau&s;e the unfortunate Tragedy of that noble Per&s;on &s;ucceeded &s;o &s;oon after, without the intervention of any notable circum&s;tances to inter|rupt it, we will rather continue the relation of it in this place, than de|fer <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The continua|tion of</HI> Moun|tro&s;e<HI>'s Affairs, after the end of the year</HI> 49, <HI>to his death.</HI></NOTE> it to be re&s;um'd in the proper &s;ea&s;on; which quickly en&s;ued, in the beginning of the next year. The Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> was vigilant enough, <MILESTONE N="10"> to ob&s;erve the motion of an Enemy that was &s;o formidable to him; and had pre&s;ent information of his Arrival in the High-lands, and of the &s;mall Forces which he had brought with him. The Parliament was then &s;itting at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> their Me&s;&s;enger being return'd to them from <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> with an account, <Q>&startq;that the King would treat with their Commi&s;|&s;ioners&endq; at <HI>Breda;</HI></Q> for whom they were preparing their In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>THE Alarm of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI>'s being landed &s;tartled them all, and gave them no lei&s;ure to think of any thing el&s;e than of &s;ending Forces to hinder the recour&s;e of others to joyn with him. They immediately &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colonel</HI> Stra|ghan <HI>&s;ent a|gain&s;t him and his &s;mall Forces.</HI></NOTE> Colonel <HI>Straghan</HI> a diligent and active Officer, with a choice party of <MILESTONE N="20"> the be&s;t Hor&s;e they had, to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t towards him, and to prevent the In&s;urrections, which they fear'd would be in &s;everal parts of the High-lands. And, within few days after, <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> follow'd with a &s;tronger party of Hor&s;e and Foot. The encouragement the Mar|quis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> receiv'd from his Friends, and the unplea&s;antne&s;s of the Quarters in which he was, prevail'd with him to march, with the&s;e few Troops, more into the Land. And the High-landers flocking to him from all quarters, though ill arm'd, and wor&s;e di&s;ciplin'd, made him undervalue any Enemy who, he thought, was yet like to encoun|ter him. <HI>Straghan</HI> made &s;uch ha&s;t, that the Earl of <HI>Southerland,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="30"> at lea&s;t pretended to have gather'd together a Body of fifteen hundred Men to meet <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> cho&s;e rather to joyn with <HI>Straghan:</HI> others did the like, who had made the &s;ame promi&s;es, or &s;tay'd at home to ex|pect the event of the fir&s;t Encounter. The Marquis was without any Body of Hor&s;e to di&s;cover the motion of an Enemy, but depended upon all nece&s;&s;ary Intelligence from the affection of the People; which he be|liev'd to be the &s;ame it was when he left them. But they were much degenerated; the Tyranny of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and his having cau&s;ed very many to be barbarou&s;ly murther'd, without any form of law or ju&s;tice, who had been in Arms with <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all Acts of pardon, <MILESTONE N="40"> and indemnity, had &s;o broken their hearts, that they were ready to do all Offices that might gratify and oblige him. So that <HI>Straghan</HI> was within a &s;mall di&s;tance of him, before he heard of his approach; and tho&s;e High-landers, who had &s;eem'd to come with much zeal to him, whether terrified, or corrupted, left him on a &s;uddain, or threw down their Arms; &s;o that he had none left, but a Company of good Officers, and five or &s;ix hundred Foreigners, <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> who had been acquainted with their Officers. With the&s;e, he betook him&s;elf to a place of &s;ome advantage by the inequality of the ground, and the bu&s;hes and &s;mall &s;hrubs which fill'd it: and there they made a defence for &s;ome <MILESTONE N="50"> time with notable Courage.</P>
<P>BUT the Enemy being &s;o much &s;uperiour in number, the Common Soldiers, being all Foreigners, after about a hundred of them were kill'd upon the Place, threw down their Arms; and the Marquis, &s;eeing all
<PB N="273" REF="2910">
lo&s;t, threw away his Ribban and <HI>George</HI> (for he was Knight of the Gar|ter) <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By whom</HI> Mountro&s;e <HI>is routed.</HI></NOTE> and found means to change his Cloaths with a fellow of the Country, and &s;o after having gone on foot two or three miles, he got into a Hou&s;e of a Gentleman, where he remain'd conceal'd about two days: mo&s;t of the other Officers were &s;hortly after taken Pri&s;oners, all the Country de&s;iring to merit from <HI>Argyle</HI> by betraying all tho&s;e into his hands which they believ'd to be his Enemies. And thus, whether by the owner of the Hou&s;e, or any other way, the Marquis him&s;elf became their Pri&s;oner. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Mountro&s;e <HI>taken Pri&s;oner.</HI></NOTE> The Strangers who were taken, were &s;et at Liberty, and tran&s;ported them&s;elves into their own countries; and the Ca&s;tle, in which there was <MILESTONE N="10"> a little Garri&s;on, pre&s;ently render'd it &s;elf; &s;o that there was no more fear of an Enemy in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners, were the next day, or &s;oon after, deliver'd to <HI>David Le&s;ley;</HI> who was come up with his Forces, and had now nothing left to do but to carry them in Triumph to <HI>Edenborough;</HI> whither Notice was quickly &s;ent of their great Victory; which was receiv'd there with wonderful joy, and accla|mation. <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> treated the Marquis with great in&s;olence, and for &s;ome days carried him in the &s;ame cloaths, and habit, in which he was taken; but at la&s;t permitted him to buy better. His behaviour was, in <MILESTONE N="20"> the whole time, &s;uch as became a great Man; his countenance &s;erene and chearful, as one that was &s;uperior to all tho&s;e reproaches, which they had prepar'd the People to pour out upon him in all the places through which he was to pa&s;s.</P>

When he was in <MILESTONE N="30"> this po&s;ture, the Hangman took off his hat, and rode him&s;elf before the Cart in his Livery, and with his Bonnet on; the other Officers, who were taken Pri&s;oners with him, walking two and two before the Cart; the Streets, and Windows being full of People to behold the Triumph over a Per&s;on who&s;e Name had made them tremble &s;ome few years be|fore, and into who&s;e hands the Magi&s;trates of that place had, upon their Knees, deliver'd the Keys of that City. In this manner he was car|ried to the Common Goal, where he was receiv'd and treated as a Com|mon Malefactor.

<P>THE next day, they executed every part and circum&s;tance of that <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Execution</NOTE> barbarous Sentence, with all the inhumanity imaginable; and he bore <MILESTONE N="10"> it with all the courage and magnanimity, and the greate&s;t piety, that a good Chri&s;tian could manife&s;t.

The Hangman brought the book that had been publi&s;h'd of his truly Heroick Actions, whil&s;t he had com|manded in that Kingdom, which Book was tied in a &s;mall Cord that was put about his Neck. The Marquis &s;miled at this new in&s;tance of their <MILESTONE N="20"> Malice, and thanked them for it; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he was plea&s;ed that it &s;hould be there; and was prouder of wearing it than ever he had been of the&endq; Garter;</Q> and &s;o renewing &s;ome devout ejaculations, he patiently en|dured the la&s;t Act of the Executioner.</P>

<P>THUS died the gallant Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> after he had given as great a te&s;timony of Loyalty, and Courage, as a Subject can do, and per|form'd as wonderful Actions in &s;everal Battles, upon as great inequality <MILESTONE N="40"> of Numbers, and as great di&s;advantages in re&s;pect of Armes, and other preparations for War, as have been perform'd in this Age. He was a Gen|tleman <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> of a very ancient Extraction, many of who&s;e Ance&s;tors had exer|ci&s;ed the highe&s;t Charges under the King in that Kingdom, and had been allied to the Crown it &s;elf. He was of very good parts, which were im|prov'd by a good Education: he had allways a great emulation, or rather a great contempt of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> (as he was too apt to contemn tho&s;e he did not love) who wanted nothing but hone&s;ty and courage to be a very extraordinary Man, having all other good Talents in a very great degree. <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> was in his nature fearle&s;s of danger, and never <MILESTONE N="$$"> declined any Enterpri&s;e for the difficulty of going through with it, but exceedingly affected tho&s;e which &s;eem'd de&s;perate to other Men, and did believe &s;omewhat to be in him&s;elf above other Men, which made him live more ea&s;ily towards tho&s;e who were, or were willing to be, in|ferior
<PB N="276" REF="2940">
to him (towards whom he exerci&s;ed wonderful civility, and ge|nero&s;ity) than with his &s;uperiors or equals. He was naturally jealous, and &s;u&s;pected tho&s;e who did not concur with him in the way, not to mean &s;o well as he. He was not without Vanity, but his Virtues were much &s;u|perior, and he well de&s;erv'd to have his Memory pre&s;erv'd, and celebrated among&s;t the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Per&s;ons of the Age in which he liv'd.</P>
<P>THE King receiv'd an Account and Information of all the&s;e particu|lars, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|&s;erves the News of all this.</NOTE> before he embarked from <HI>Holland,</HI> without any other Apology for the Affront and Indignity to him&s;elf, than that they a&s;&s;ured him, <Q>&startq;that the proceeding again&s;t the late Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> had been for his&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> Service.</Q> They who were mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ed with <HI>Argyle</HI> and his Faction, were not &s;orry for this inhuman, and mon&s;trous pro&s;ecution; which at the &s;ame time mu&s;t render him the more odious, and had rid them of an Enemy that they thought would have been more dangerous to them; and they per&s;waded the King, who was enough afflicted with the News, and all the circum&s;tances of it, <Q>&startq;that he might &s;ooner take revenge upon that People by a temporary complying with them, and going to them, than &s;taying away, and ab&s;enting him&s;elf, which would inve&s;t them in an ab&s;olute Dominion in that Kingdom, and give them power to cor|rupt or de&s;troy all tho&s;e who yet remain'd faithful to him, and were&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> ready to &s;pend their lives in his Service: and &s;o his Maje&s;ty pur&s;ued his former re&s;olution of embarking for <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the Ma&s;&s;acre of that Body of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Tredagh,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> and the treacherous giving up the Towns in <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> by the Officers of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> there broke out &s;o implacable a jealou&s;y among&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> again&s;t all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that no Orders of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> found any obedience, nor could he draw an Army together. At the making of the Peace, he had con&s;ented that the Confederate Roman Ca|tholicks &s;hould name a Number of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, by who&s;e Orders and Mini&s;try all Levies of Men, and all Collections of Money were to be <MILESTONE N="30"> made, according to the directions of the Lord Lieutenant. And &s;uch Per|&s;ons were named, in who&s;e Affections, for the mo&s;t part, the Lieutenant was well &s;atisfied, and the re&s;t were &s;uch as were not like to be able to give any interruption. A certain Number of the&s;e were appointed to be allways in the Army, and near the Per&s;on of the Lord Lieutenant, and the re&s;t in their &s;everal Stations, where they were mo&s;t like to advance the Service. Many of the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners were of the Roman Catholick Nobility, Per&s;ons of honour, and very &s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s, wilful|ne&s;s, and wickedne&s;s of that Rebellion; and did manife&s;t all po&s;&s;ible zeal and affection to the King's Service, engaging their Per&s;ons in all Enter|pri&s;es <MILESTONE N="40"> of danger, and u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible indu&s;try to rai&s;e Men and Money, whereby the Lord Lieutenant might be enabled to carry on the War in the Spring. But many of the other, after tho&s;e misfortunes had fallen out, which are mention'd before, either totally de&s;ponded, and rather thought of providing for them&s;elves than for the pre&s;ervation of the Publick; or &s;omented the jealou&s;ies which were among&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and incen&s;ed them again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were &s;till with the Lord Lieute|nant; &s;o that his Orders were not obeyed at all, or not in time, which was as bad; and their Clergy and Fryars publickly incen&s;ed the People again&s;t the Articles of the Peace, and de&s;ired to have an Army rai&s;ed <MILESTONE N="50"> apart under a General of their own.</P>
<P>THE Lord Lieutenant now di&s;cover'd the Rea&s;on, why <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> had refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to the Peace which the Confederate Roman Ca|tholicks had made with the King, and kept his Army in <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> from

But the truth was, from the time of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s tran&s;port|ing him&s;elf out of <HI>France,</HI> and that the corre&s;pondence was di&s;cover'd to be between Him and the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and the Treaty begun with the Confederate Catholicks, the clo&s;e Committee at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;ent &s;ecret In&s;tructions to <HI>Monk,</HI> who Commanded part of their Forces in <HI>Ireland,</HI> <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould endeavour to treat with <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and &s;o&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> divide him from the re&s;t of the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI></Q> which <HI>Monk</HI> found opportunity to do: and it was no &s;ooner propo&s;ed than hearken'd unto by <HI>O Neile;</HI> who pre&s;ently &s;ent a tru&s;ty Me&s;&s;enger with &s;uch Propo&s;itions to <HI>Monk,</HI> as he de&s;ired to have granted to him. <Q>He offer'd, &startq;with his Army, which &s;hould allways con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch a Number of Hor&s;e and Foot, and Ar|tillery, as &s;hould be agreed between them, to &s;erve the Parliament;&endq; and not to &s;eparate from their Intere&s;t;</Q> and propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that he, and all his Party that &s;hould adhere to him, &s;hould enjoy the Exerci&s;e of their Religion, without any prejudice or di&s;advantage: that him&s;elf might be re&s;tored to tho&s;e Lands which his Ance&s;tors had been po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd <MILESTONE N="20"> of in <HI>Tyrone, London-Derry,</HI> or any other parts of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that all tho&s;e, who had or would adhere to him, &s;hould be likewi&s;e re|&s;tored&endq; to their E&s;tates;</Q> and that an Act of Oblivion might be granted. <HI>Monk</HI> receiv'd the&s;e Propo&s;itions; and after he had peru&s;ed them, he &s;ent him word, <Q>&startq;that there were &s;ome particulars, which, he doubted, would &s;hock and offend the Parliament, and therefore de&s;ired they&endq; might be alter'd;</Q> and propo&s;ed the Alterations he advi&s;ed; which principally concern'd the publick Exerci&s;e of their Religion; which he &s;o qualified, that they might well enough &s;atisfy; and propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that, if <HI>O Neile</HI> would con&s;ent to tho&s;e Alterations, he would return the Treaty <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ign'd by him; which he would immediately &s;end over to the Parlia|ment for their confirmation; and that, in the mean time, there might be a Ce&s;&s;ation of Armes between them for three Months; in which time, and much le&s;s, he pre&s;umed, he &s;hould receive a ratification of&endq; the Treaty from the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>OWEN <HI>O Neile</HI> con&s;ented to the Alterations, &s;et his Hand and Seal to the Treaty, and return'd it to <HI>Monk,</HI> with his con&s;ent likewi&s;e to the Ce&s;&s;ation for three Months.

After all the pa&s;&s;ion and choler which they thought nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s upon this &s;ubject, they declar'd, <Q>&startq;that they had given no Authority to <HI>Monk</HI> to enter into that Treaty; and therefore, that it was void, and &s;hould never be con|firm'd by them; but that, &s;ince he had proceeded out of the &s;incerity of his heart, and as he thought (how erroneou&s;ly &s;oever) for the good and benefit of the Common-wealth, he &s;hould be excu&s;ed; and no far|ther&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> que&s;tion'd thereupon.</Q> For they knew well, that he could pro|duce &s;uch a Warrant from tho&s;e in Authority, as would well ju&s;tify his proceeding: and &s;o the Treaty with <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> became void, though they had receiv'd a very con&s;iderable benefit by it; for though the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> had not yet &s;ubmitted to the Peace, and had not receiv'd di|rections from <HI>Edenborough</HI> to acknowledge the authority of the Lord Lieutenant, which they ought to have had before that time, yet, after the Murther of the late King, they had u&s;ed all acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Parliament Forces, and had be&s;ieged <HI>London-Derry;</HI> the only con|&s;iderable place that yielded obedience to the Parliament; which was <MILESTONE N="20"> defended by S^r <HI>Charles Coote,</HI> and when it was brought to &s;ome extre|mity, by the Ce&s;&s;ation made with <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and by his connivance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>London-Derry</HI> was reliev'd; and <HI>O Neile</HI> finding him&s;elf deluded by the Parliament, &s;ent then to offer his &s;ervice and conjunction to the Lord Lieutenant, with abundant profe&s;&s;ions of fidelity, and re|venge.</P>

For the Officers and Ma&s;ters of Ships, who contracted, and were bound to deliver their Men at &s;uch Ports as were a&s;&s;ign'd to them, and where care was taken for their reception, and conduct to the Quarters which were appointed, according to the &s;ervice to which they were de&s;ign'd, either for <HI>Catalonia,</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> (after they had been long at Sea, by which the Soldiers, who were crowded more together into <MILESTONE N="20"> one Ship than was fit for &s;o long voyages, had contracted many di&s;ea&s;es, and many were dead, and thrown over board) a&s;&s;oon as they came upon the Coa&s;t made all ha&s;t to land, how far &s;oever from the place at which they &s;tood bound to deliver their Men; by which, in tho&s;e places that could make re&s;i&s;tance, they were not &s;uffer'd to land, and in others no provi&s;ion was made for their reception or march, but very great Num|bers were &s;tarv'd or knock'd in the head by the Country People, and few ever came up to the Armies, except Officers; who flock'd to <HI>Ma|drid</HI> for the remainder of their Monies; where the Mini&s;ters receiv'd them with reproaches for not ob&s;erving their conditions, and refu&s;ed to <MILESTONE N="30"> pay either them, or the Ma&s;ters of the Ships, what remain'd to be paid by them. This was the Ca&s;e of too many: though the truth is, where the Articles were punctually ob&s;erv'd, and the Ships arriv'd in the very Ports a&s;&s;ign'd, by the defect in the Orders &s;ent from the Court, or the negligent execution of them, the poor Men were often kept from di&s;|embarking, till &s;ome Officers went to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and return'd with more po&s;itive Orders, and afterwards &s;o ill provi&s;ion was made for their re|fre&s;hing and march, that rarely half of tho&s;e who were &s;hipp'd in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> ever liv'd to do any &s;ervice in <HI>Spain:</HI> and nothing could be more wonderful, than that the Mini&s;ters there &s;hould i&s;&s;ue out &s;uch va&s;t Sums <MILESTONE N="40"> in Money for the rai&s;ing of Soldiers, and bringing them into the King|dom at very liberal and bountiful rates to the Officers, and take &s;o very little care to cheri&s;h, and nouri&s;h them, when they came thither; which manife&s;ted how loo&s;e the Government was.</P>
<P>IT is very true, that there was at that time a much greater inclina|tion in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> for the &s;ervice of <HI>Spain</HI> than of <HI>France;</HI> yet the Cardi|nal imploy'd more active and dextrous In&s;truments to make u&s;e of the Liberty that was granted, and Shipping was more ea&s;ily procur'd, the pa&s;&s;age being &s;horter; in&s;omuch that there were not fewer than twenty thou&s;and Men at the &s;ame time tran&s;ported out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into the King|dom <MILESTONE N="$$"> of <HI>France;</HI> of who&s;e behaviour in the one Kingdom and the other, there will be abundant Argument hereafter to di&s;cour&s;e at large.

By them he broke the &s;trict union between the Parliament and the <HI>Scots,</HI> and then took the King out of the hands of the Parliament, and kept him in the Army, with &s;o many fair profe&s;&s;ions of intending better to his Maje&s;ty, and his Party, than the other did; by them the <MILESTONE N="40"> Presbyterians had been affronted, and troden under foot, and the City of <HI>London</HI> expo&s;ed to di&s;grace and infamy; by them he had broken the Treaty of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> driven out of the Parliament, by force of Arms, all tho&s;e who de&s;ir'd peace, and at la&s;t executed his barbarous malice upon the &s;acred Per&s;on of the King: and when he had apply'd them to all tho&s;e u&s;es, for which he thought them to be mo&s;t fit, he hoped, and endeavour'd to have reduced them again, by a &s;evere hand, into that order and obedience from whence he had &s;educed them, and which was now as nece&s;&s;ary to his future purpo&s;e of Government. But they had ta&s;ted too much of the plea&s;ure of having their part, and <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;hare in it, to be willing to be &s;tripp'd, and depriv'd of it; and made an unskilfull computation of what they &s;hould be able to do for the fu|ture, by the great things they had done before in tho&s;e Changes and Re|volutions

which are mention'd; not con&s;idering, that the &s;uperior Of|ficers of the Army were now united with the Parliament, and concurr'd entirely in the &s;ame de&s;igns.

<P><Q>_THE Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who did not believe that the King would ever have ventur'd into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the conditions he had &s;ent, was &s;urpri&s;ed with the account the Commi&s;&s;ioners had given him, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to embark the next day; that he would leave all his Chaplains, and his other Servants be|hind him, and only deferr'd to take the Co|venant him&s;elf till he came thither, with a re&s;olution to &s;atisfy the Kirk if they pre&s;s'd&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> it.</Q> Thereupon he immediately di&s;patched away another Ve&s;&s;el with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle <HI>&s;ends new Propo&s;i|tions; which mi&s;&s;ed the King.</HI></NOTE> new Propo&s;itions, which the Commi&s;&s;ioners were to in&s;i&s;t upon, and not to con&s;ent to the King's coming into that Kingdom, without He likewi&s;e con&s;ented to tho&s;e. But that Ve&s;&s;el met not with the King's Fleet, which, that it might avoid that of the Parliament, which attended to intercept the King, had held its cour&s;e more Northward, where there are good Harbours; and &s;o had put into a Harbour near <HI>Sterlin,</HI> that is, within a days Journey of it, but where there was no Town nearer than that for his Maje&s;ty's reception, or where there was any accommoda|tion even for very ordinary Pa&s;&s;engers. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>

leave to put him&s;elf into the hands of tho&s;e who re&s;olv'd nothing le&s;s than to &s;erve him. The Lords of the other Party, who had prevailed with him to &s;ubmit to all that had been required of him, quickly found that they had deceiv'd both Him and Them&s;elves, and that no body had any authority but tho&s;e Men who were their mortal Enemies. So that they would not expo&s;e them&s;elves to be impri&s;on'd, or to be removed from the King; but, with his Maje&s;ty's leave, and having given him the be&s;t advice they could, what he &s;hould do for Him&s;elf, and what he &s;hould do for Them, they put them&s;elves on Shore before the King di&s;embark'd; and found means to go to tho&s;e places where they might be &s;ome time concealed, and which were like to be at di&s;tance enough <MILESTONE N="10"> from the King.

<P>THE King was receiv'd by the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> with all the out|ward <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle <HI>re|ceives the King.

communicated to him; nor was he, in the lea&s;t degree, communicated with, in any part of the Government: Yet they made great &s;hew of outward reverence to him, and even the Chaplains, when they u&s;ed rudene&s;s and barbarity in their reprehen&s;ions and reproaches, approach'd him &s;till with bended knees, and in the humble&s;t po&s;tures. There was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle<HI>'s beha|viour to him.</HI></NOTE> never a better Courtier than <HI>Argyle;</HI> who u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible addre&s;s to make him&s;elf gracious to the King, entertain'd him with very plea&s;ant di&s;cour&s;es, with &s;uch in&s;inuations, that the King did not only very well like his conver&s;ation, but often believ'd that he had a mind to plea&s;e and gratify him: but then, when his Maje&s;ty made any attempt to get &s;ome <MILESTONE N="10"> of his Servants about him, or to reconcile the two Factions, that the Kingdom might be united, he gather'd up his countenance, and retir'd from him, without ever yielding to any one propo&s;ition that was made to him by his Maje&s;ty. In a word, the King's table was well &s;erv'd; there he &s;ate in Maje&s;ty, waited upon with decency: he had good Hor&s;es to ride abroad to take the air, and was then well attended; and, in all publick appearances, &s;eem'd to want nothing that was due to a great King. In all other re&s;pects, with reference to power to oblige or gra|tify any Man, to di&s;po&s;e or order any thing, or him&s;elf to go to any other place than was a&s;&s;ign'd to him, he had nothing of a Prince, but <MILESTONE N="20"> might very well be look'd upon as a Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>BUT that which was of &s;tate and lu&s;tre made mo&s;t noi&s;e, and was in|du&s;triou&s;ly tran&s;mitted into all Nations and States; the other of di&s;re|&s;pect or re&s;traint, was not communicated; and if it could not be en|tirely conceal'd, it was con&s;ider'd only as a Faction between particular great Men, who contended to get the power into their hands, that they might the more notoriou&s;ly and eminently &s;erve that Prince whom they all equally acknowledged. The King's condition &s;eem'd wonder|fully advanced, and his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Kingdom without a Rival, in which there was no appearance of an Enemy, look'd like an earne&s;t <MILESTONE N="30"> for the recovery of the other Two, and, for the pre&s;ent, as a great addi|tion of power to him in his Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by a conjunction, and ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> the King's Lieutenant there.</P>
<P>ALL Men who had di&s;luaded his Maje&s;ty's repair into <HI>Scotland,</HI> were look'd upon as very weak Politicians, or as Men who oppo&s;ed the Publick good, becau&s;e they were excluded, and might not be &s;uffer'd to act any part in the adventure; and they who had advanced the de&s;ign, valued them&s;elves exceedingly upon their activity in that &s;ervice. The States of <HI>Holland</HI> thought they had merited much in &s;uffering their <MILESTONE N="40"> Ships to tran&s;port him, and &s;o being mini&s;terial to his greatne&s;s; which they hoped would be remember'd; and they gave all countenance to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Merchants and Factors who liv'd in their Dominions, and &s;ome &s;ecret credit, that they might &s;end Armes and Ammunition, and what&s;oever el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary for the King's &s;ervice into that Kingdom. <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf look'd very chearfully upon the change; congratulated the Queen with much ceremony, and many profe&s;&s;ions; and took pains to have it thought and believ'd, that they had had a &s;hare in the Coun&s;el, and contributed very much to the reception the King found in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by their influence upon <HI>Argyle</HI> and his Party. And it hath been men|tion'd <MILESTONE N="50"> before, how great a reputation this little dawning of power, how clouded &s;oever, gave to the Emba&s;&s;adours in <HI>Spain,</HI> and had rai&s;ed them, from &s;uch a degree of di&s;re&s;pect, as was near to contempt, to the full

dignity and e&s;timation in that Court that was due to the Station in which they were.</P>
<P>THERE fell out there an accident at this time, which was a great manife&s;tation of the affection of that Court, and indeed of the Nation. <Q>As <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> had u&s;ed all the credit he had, to di&s;po&s;e that Court to a good corre&s;pondence with the Parliament, &s;o he had employ'd as much care to encline tho&s;e in <HI>England</HI> to have a confidence in the affection of his Ma&s;ter, and a&s;&s;ur'd them, &startq;that if they would &s;end an Emba&s;&s;adour, or other Mini&s;ter into <HI>Spain,</HI> he &s;hould find a good&endq; reception.</Q> The Parliament, in the infancy of their Common-wealth, had more inclination to make a friend&s;hip with <HI>Spain</HI> than with <HI>France,</HI> having at that time a very great prejudice to the Cardinal; and therefore, upon this encouragement from <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> they re&s;olv'd to &s;end an Envoy to <HI>Madrid;</HI> and made choice of one <HI>A&s;cham,</HI> a Scholar, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;cham <HI>&s;ent Agent into</HI> Spain <HI>from the Parliament of</HI> England.</NOTE> had been concern'd in drawing up the King's Tryal, and had written a book to determine in what time, and after how many years, the Alle|giance which is due from Subjects to their Soveraigns, comes to be de|termin'd after a Conque&s;t; and that, from that term, it ought to be paid to tho&s;e who had &s;ubdued them: a &s;peculation they thought fit to cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS Man, unacquainted with bu&s;ine&s;s, and unskill'd in language, <MILESTONE N="$$"> attended by three others, the one a Renegado <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Friar, who had been bred in <HI>Spain,</HI> and was well ver&s;ed in the language; another, who was to &s;erve in the condition of a Secretary; and the third, an in|ferior fellow for any &s;ervice, arriv'd all in <HI>Spain</HI> in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chant's Ship: of which <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> gave &s;uch timely notice, that he was receiv'd and entertain'd by the chief Magi&s;trate at his landing, un|till they gave notice of it to the Court.

THAT this new Agent might come &s;ecurely to <HI>Madrid,</HI> an old Offi|cer of the Army was &s;ent from <HI>Sevil</HI> to accompany him thither; who came with him in the Coach, and gave notice every night to <HI>Don Lewis</HI> of their advance. There were at that time, over and above the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, many Officers and Soldiers in <HI>Madrid,</HI> who had &s;erv'd in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armies, both in <HI>Catalonia</HI> and in <HI>Portugal;</HI> and the&s;e Men had con&s;ulted among&s;t them&s;elves how they might kill this fellow, who came as an Agent from the new Republick of <HI>England;</HI> and half a do|zen of them, having notice of the day he was to come into the Town, which was generally di&s;cour&s;ed of, rode out of the Town to meet him; but, mi&s;&s;ing him, they return'd again, and found that he had enter'd <MILESTONE N="10"> into it by another way; and having taken a view of his lodging, they met again the next Morning; and finding, accidentally, one of the Em|ba&s;&s;adours Servants in the &s;treets, they per&s;waded him to go with them, and &s;o went to the Hou&s;e where <HI>A&s;chan</HI> lodged; and, without asking any Que&s;tions, walked directly up the &s;tairs into his Chamber, leaving a couple of their number at the door of the &s;treet, le&s;t, upon any noi&s;e in the hou&s;e, that door might be &s;hut upon them. They who went up, drew their &s;words; and be&s;ides their intentions, in di&s;order, kill'd the Fryar as well as the Agent; and &s;o return'd to their Companions with <NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;cham <HI>kill'd by &s;ome Officers at his lodgings in</HI> Madrid.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> their &s;words naked and bloody, and &s;ome fooli&s;h expre&s;&s;ions of triumph, as if they had perform'd a very gallant and a ju&s;tifiable &s;ervice. Not|with&s;tanding all which, they might have di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves, and been &s;ecure, the People were &s;o little concern'd to enquire what they had done. But they being in confu&s;ion, and retaining no compo&s;ed thoughts about them, finding the door of a little Chapel open, went in thither <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All but one fly to a Chapel for &s;anctuary; he, to the</HI> Vene|tian <HI>Emba&s;&s;a|dours.</HI></NOTE> for &s;anctuary: Only he who was in &s;ervice of the Emba&s;&s;adours, &s;epa|rated him&s;elf from the re&s;t, and went into the hou&s;e of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour. By this time the people of the hou&s;e where the Man lay, had gone up into the chamber; where they found two dead, and the <MILESTONE N="30"> other two crept, in a terrible fright, under the bed; and the Magi&s;trates and people were about the Church, and talking with, and examining the per&s;ons who were there: <Q>and the rumour was pre&s;ently divulged about the Town, &startq;&endq;that one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adours was kill'd.</Q></P>
<P>THEY were at that time entring into their Coach to take the air, ac|cording to an appointment which they had made the day before. When they were inform'd of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and that <HI>Harry Progers,</HI> who was their Servant, had been in the action, and was retir'd to the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour, they were in trouble and perplexity; di&s;|mi&s;s'd their Coach; and return'd to their lodging. <Q>Though they ab|horr'd <MILESTONE N="40"> the action that was committed, they fore&s;aw, the pre&s;ence of one of their own Servants in it, and even &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate words they had u&s;ed, in their expo&s;tulation with <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> again&s;t the reception of &s;uch a Me&s;&s;enger, as if &startq;the King their Ma&s;ter had too many Sub|jects&endq; in that place, for &s;uch a fellow to appear there with any &s;ecurity, would make it be believ'd by many, that the attempt had not been made without their con&s;ent or privity.</Q> In this trouble of mind, they immediately writ a Letter to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Emba&s;&s;a|dours write to</HI> Don Lewis <HI>a|bout this action.</HI></NOTE> they had of this unfortunate ra&s;h action; <Q>&startq;of which, they hoped, he did believe, if they had had any notice or &s;u&s;picion, they would have&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> prevented it.</Q> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> return'd them a very dry An&s;wer; <Q>&startq;That he could not imagine that they could have a hand in &s;o foul an a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> in the Court (for all <HI>Madrid</HI> is call'd, and look'd upon as

the Court)</Q> <Q>&startq;of a per&s;on under the immediate protection of the King: however, that it was an action &s;o unheard of, and &s;o di&s;honourable to the King, that his Maje&s;ty was re&s;olv'd to have it examin'd to the bot|tom, and that exemplary ju&s;tice &s;hould be done upon the Offenders: that his own Emba&s;&s;adour in <HI>England</HI> might be in great danger upon this Murther; and that they would &s;end an Expre&s;s pre&s;ently thither, to &s;atisfy the Parliament how much his Catholick Maje&s;ty dete&s;ted, and was offended with it, and re&s;olv'd to do ju&s;tice upon it; and if his Em|ba&s;&s;adour underwent any inconvenience There, they were not to won|der,&endq; if his Maje&s;ty were &s;evere Here;</Q> and &s;o left it to Them to imagine <MILESTONE N="10"> that their own Per&s;ons might not be &s;afe.</P>
<P>BUT they knew the temper of the Court too well, to have the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of that: yet they were a little &s;urpri&s;ed, when they fir&s;t &s;aw the multitude of people, gather'd together about their hou&s;e, upon the fir&s;t News of the action; in&s;omuch that the &s;treet before their hou&s;e, which was the broade&s;t in <HI>Madrid</HI> (the <HI>Calle de Alcala)</HI> was &s;o throng'd, that Men could hardly pa&s;s. But they were quickly out of that appre|hen&s;ion, being a&s;&s;ured, that the jealou&s;y that one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;|&s;adours had &s;uffer'd violence, had brought that multitude together; which they found to be true; for they no &s;ooner &s;hew'd them&s;elves in <MILESTONE N="20"> a Balcony to the people, but they &s;aluted them with great kindne&s;s, pray'd for the King their Ma&s;ter, cur&s;ed and reviled the Murtherers of his Father; and &s;o departed. They who had betaken them&s;elves to the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tho&s;e that fled to the Chapel are taken thence, and im|pri&s;oned; the other e&s;capes into</HI> France.</NOTE> Chapel, were, the next day or the &s;econd, taken from thence by a prin|cipal Officer after examination, and &s;ent to the pri&s;on: the other was not inquir'd after; but, having conceal'd him&s;elf for ten or twelve days, he went out of the Town in the night; and, without any interruption or trouble, went into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Of all the Courts in Chri&s;tendom <HI>Madrid</HI> is that where Emba&s;&s;a|dours, and Publick Mini&s;ters, receive the greate&s;t re&s;pect; which, be|&s;ides <MILESTONE N="30"> the honour and punctuality of that People, bred up in the ob&s;er|vation of di&s;tances and order, proceeds from the excellent method the Emba&s;&s;adours have of living with mutual re&s;pect towards each other, and in mutual concernment for each others honour and privileges: &s;o that, if any Emba&s;&s;adour, in Him&s;elf for his Servants, receive any affront or di&s;re&s;pect, all the other Emba&s;&s;adours repair to him; and offer their &s;ervice, and interpo&s;ition; by which means they are not only pre&s;erv'd from any inva&s;ion by any private and particular in&s;olence, but even from &s;ome Acts of Power, which the Court it &s;elf hath &s;ome time thought fit to exerci&s;e, upon an extraordinary occa&s;ion, towards a Mini&s;ter of whom they had no regard. All are united on the behalf of the Character; <MILESTONE N="40"> and will not &s;uffer that to be done towards one, which, by the con&s;e|quence, may reflect upon all.</P>
<P>IT cannot be imagin'd, with what a general compa&s;&s;ion all the Em|ba&s;&s;adours look'd upon the&s;e unhappy Gentlemen, who had involv'd them&s;elves by their ra&s;hne&s;s in &s;o much peril. They came to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adours to advi&s;e, and con&s;ult what might be done to pre&s;erve them, every one offering his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <Q>The Action could in no degree be ju&s;tified; all that could be urged and in&s;i&s;ted upon in their behalf, was the Privilege of Sanctuary, &startq;They had betaken them&s;elves to the Church; and the taking them from thence, by what Authority &s;oever, was a <MILESTONE N="50"> violation of the rights and immunities of the Church, which, by the Law of the Kingdom, was ever defended with all tenderne&s;s. So that
<PB N="291" REF="3070">
before the guilt of the blood could be examin'd, the Pri&s;oners de&s;ired that their Privilege might be examin'd, and that they might have&endq; Council a&s;&s;ign'd them to that purpo&s;e;</Q> which was granted; and &s;e|veral Arguments were made upon the matter of Law before the Judges; who were favourable enough to the Pri&s;oners. <Q>The King's Council urged, &startq;that, in ca&s;e of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the Privilege of Sanctuary was&endq; never allow'd (which is true) and cited many Pre&s;idents of late years in <HI>Madrid</HI> it &s;elf,</Q> where, for le&s;s crimes than of blood, Men had been taken out of the Sanctuary, and tried, and executed. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;adours thought not fit to appear on their behalf, and yet were not <MILESTONE N="10"> willing that the new Republick &s;hould receive &s;o much countenance from that Court, as would have re&s;ulted from putting tho&s;e Gentlemen to death as if they had killed a publick Mini&s;ter. The Pope's Nuntio, <HI>Julio Ro&s;piglio&s;i,</HI> who was afterwards <HI>Clement</HI> the Ninth, could not, ac|cording <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Nuntio</HI> Ro&s;piglio&s;i <HI>required them to be deliver'd back.</HI></NOTE> to the Style of the Roman Court, either give, or receive vi&s;its from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour: but they perform'd civilities to each other by Me&s;&s;ages, and pa&s;&s;ed mutual Salutations, with all re&s;pect to each other, as they met abroad. <Q>And the <HI>Venetian</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour brought them frequent a&s;&s;urances, &startq;that the Nuntio had &s;poken very effectually to the King, and to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> for the redelivery of the Pri&s;oners to <MILESTONE N="20"> the Church, and pre&s;&s;ed it &s;o hard upon the Con&s;cience of the King,&endq; that he had &s;ome promi&s;e that they &s;hould not &s;uffer.</Q></P>
<P>IN the mean time, thundering Letters came from the Parliament, with great menaces what they would do, if exemplary ju&s;tice was not inflicted upon tho&s;e who had murther'd their Envoy; <Q>and <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> urged it, as if &startq;he thought him&s;elf in danger till full &s;atisfaction &s;hould be given in that particular; all which for the pre&s;ent made deep im|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;o that they knew not what to do; the King often declaring that he would not infringe the privilege of the Church, and &s;o under|go the cen&s;ure of the Pope, for any advantage he could receive with&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> reference to any of his Dominions.</Q> In the end (that the di&s;cour&s;e of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The I&s;&s;ue of this bu&s;ine&s;s after the Em|ba&s;&s;adours de|parture.</NOTE> this Affair may not be re&s;umed again hereafter) after a long impri&s;on|ment (for during the Emba&s;&s;adours &s;tay they would not bring them to any Trial, le&s;t they might &s;eem to do any thing upon their &s;ollicitation) the Pri&s;oners were proceeded again&s;t a&s;&s;oon, or &s;hortly after the Em|ba&s;&s;adours had left <HI>Madrid,</HI> and were all condemn'd to dye; and a&s;&s;oon as the Sentence was declared, all the Pri&s;oners were again deliver'd into the &s;ame Church; where they remain'd many days, having Provi&s;ions of Victuals &s;ent to them by many Per&s;ons of Quality, until they had all opportunity to make their e&s;cape; which was very &s;ucce&s;sfully done <MILESTONE N="40"> by all but one; who, being the only Prote&s;tant among&s;t them, was more maliciou&s;ly looked after and watch'd, and was follow'd, and apprehended after he had made three days Journey from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and carried back thither, and put to death: which was all the &s;atisfaction the Parliament could obtain in that Affair; and is an in&s;tance, how far that People was from any affection to tho&s;e of <HI>England</HI> in their hearts, how much &s;o|ever they complied with them out of the nece&s;&s;ity of their fortune.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;ome weeks were pa&s;&s;ed after that unlucky accident, the Emba&s;&s;adours went to confer with <HI>Don Lewis</HI> upon &s;ome other occur|rence, with no purpo&s;e of mentioning any thing of the Pri&s;oners. <Q><HI>Don</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;poke of it in a manner they did not expect, one expre&s;&s;ion was <HI>&startq;Yo tengo invidia de e&s;tos Cavaleros &amp;c.</HI> I envy tho&s;e Gentlemen for having done &s;o noble an action, how penal &s;oever it may prove to&endq;

them, to revenge the blood of their King.</Q> <Q>Whereas, he &s;aid, &startq;the King his Ma&s;ter wanted &s;uch re&s;olute Subjects; otherwi&s;e he would never have lo&s;t a Kingdom, as he had done <HI>Portugal,</HI> for want of one brave Man; who, by taking away the life of the U&s;urper, might at any time,&endq; during the fir&s;t two years, have put an end to that Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P>To return now to the Affairs of <HI>Scotland:</HI> whether when the Mar|quis of <HI>Argyle</HI> fir&s;t knew that the King would venture him&s;elf into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> he &s;u&s;pected his own &s;trength, and &s;o &s;ent for his Friend <HI>Cromwell</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; or whether it &s;eem'd more rea&s;onable to the Parliament, when it was a&s;&s;ured of the King's being there, to vi&s;it him in that King|dom, <MILESTONE N="10"> than to expect a Vi&s;it from him, is not enough clear at this time. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell, <HI>&s;ent for by the Parliament out of</HI> Ireland, <HI>leaves</HI> Ireton <HI>his Deputy.</HI></NOTE> But a&s;&s;oon as the King was in <HI>Scotland, Cromwell,</HI> being &s;ent for by the Parliament, left what remain'd to be done in <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Ireton</HI> (who had married his Daughter) and made him Deputy; and tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>England;</HI> where the Parliament, not without great oppo&s;ition from all the Presbyterian Party, re&s;olv'd to &s;end an Army into <HI>Scotland.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment re&s;olv'd to &s;end an Ar|my into</HI> Scot|land.</NOTE> Many oppo&s;ed it, as they thought it an unju&s;t and unprofitable War, and knew it mu&s;t be a very expen&s;ive one; and others, becau&s;e it would keep up, and increa&s;e the power and authority of the Army in <HI>England;</HI> which was already found to be very grievous. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THIS re&s;olution produced another great alteration: <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who had hitherto worne the name of General, declared po&s;itively that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax <HI>gives up his Com|mi&s;&s;ion.</HI></NOTE> would not command the Army again&s;t <HI>Scotland.</HI> <Q>The Presbyterians &s;aid, &startq;it was becau&s;e he thought the War unlawful, in regard it was again&s;t&endq; tho&s;e of the &s;ame Religion;</Q> but his Friends would have it believ'd, that he would not fight again&s;t the King. Hereupon <HI>Cromwell</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>made General.</HI></NOTE> cho&s;en General; which made no alteration in the Army; which he had modell'd to his own mind before, and commanded as ab&s;olutely.

They were &s;o careful in the modelling this Army, that they &s;uf|fer'd few or no Officers, or Soldiers, who had been in the Engagement of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> or who gave the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to be &s;u&s;pected to wi&s;h well to the King or to the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Party, to be li&s;ted or re|ceiv'd into their Service.

and preached again&s;t the Vices of the Court, and the impiety and ty|ranny of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> equally; and promi&s;ed their Army Victory over the Enemy as po&s;itively, and in as confident terms, as if God him&s;elf had directed them to declare it. The King de&s;ired that he might command this Army, at lea&s;t run the fortune of it. But they were hardly prevail'd with to give him leave once to &s;ee it; and, after he had been in it three or four hours, upon the ob&s;ervation that the Common Soldiers &s;eem'd to be much plea&s;ed to &s;ee him, they cau&s;ed him to return, and the next day carried him to a place at a greater di&s;tance from the Army; <Q>de|claring, &startq;that they found the Soldiers too much inclined to put their <MILESTONE N="10"> confidence in the Arme of Fle&s;h; whereas their hope and dependence was to be only in God; and they were mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured of Victory by the&endq; prayers, and piety of the Kirk.</Q></P>
<P>IN <HI>July Cromwell</HI> enter'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and marched without any oppo|&s;ition <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en|ters</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> till he came within le&s;s than a days Journey of <HI>Edenborough;</HI> where he found the <HI>Scots</HI> Army encamped upon a very advantageous ground; and he made his Quarters as near as he could conveniently, and yet with di&s;advantages enough.

Whether that March was to retire out of &s;o barren a Country for want of Provi&s;ions (which no doubt were very &s;carce; and the Sea&s;on of the year would not permit them to depend upon all nece&s;&s;ary Supplies by Sea, for it was now the Month of <HI>Septem|ber)</HI> or whether that motion was only to draw the <HI>Scots</HI> from the ad|vantageous po&s;t of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, is not yet under&s;tood. <MILESTONE N="30"> But it was confe&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, that, if the <HI>Scots</HI> had remain'd within their Trenches, and &s;ent Parties of Hor&s;e to have follow'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army clo&s;ely, they mu&s;t have &s;o di&s;order'd them, that they would have <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The di&s;tre&s;s of</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s Army.</HI></NOTE> left their Cannon, and all their heavy Carriage behind them, be&s;ides the danger the Foot mu&s;t have been in. But the <HI>Scots</HI> did not intend to part with them &s;o ea&s;ily; they doubted not but to have the Spoil of the whole Army. And therefore they no &s;ooner di&s;cern'd that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were upon their march, but they decamped, and followed with their whole Body all the night following, and found them&s;elves in the morning within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the Enemy: for <HI>Cromwell</HI> was quick|ly <MILESTONE N="40"> adverti&s;ed that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was di&s;lodged, and marched after him; and thereupon he made a &s;tand, and put his Men in good order. The <HI>Scots</HI> found they were not upon &s;o clear a cha&s;e as they imagin'd, and placed them&s;elves again upon &s;uch a &s;ide of a Hill, as they believ'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would not have the Courage to attack them there.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Cromwell</HI> knew them too well to fear them upon any ground, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en+tirely routs the</HI> Scots <HI>in the Battle of</HI> Dunba$</NOTE> when there were no Trenches, or Fortifications to keep him from them; and therefore he made ha&s;t to charge them on all &s;ides, upon what ad|vantage-ground &s;oever they &s;tood. Their Hor&s;e did not &s;u&s;tain one Charge; but fled, and were pur&s;ued with a great execution. The Foot depended much upon their Mini&s;ters, who preached, and prayed, and <MILESTONE N="50"> a&s;&s;ured them of the Victory, till the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were upon them; and &s;ome of their Preachers were knocked in the head, whil&s;t they were promi&s;ing
<PB N="294" REF="3100">
the Victory. Though there was &s;o little re&s;i&s;tance made, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> lo&s;t very few Men by that days Service, yet the Execution was very terrible upon the Enemy; the whole Body of the Foot being, upon the matter, cut in pieces: no quarter was given till they were weary of killing; &s;o that there were between five and &s;ix thou&s;and dead upon the place; and very few, but they who e&s;caped by the heels of their Hor&s;e, were without terrible wounds; of which very many died &s;hortly after; e&s;pecially &s;uch of their Mini&s;ters who were not kill'd upon the place, as very many were, had very notable marks about the head, and the face, that any Body might know that they were not hurt by chance, or in <MILESTONE N="10"> the croud, but by very good will. All the Cannon, Ammunition, Car|riages, and Baggage, were entirely taken, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> with his victo|rious Army marched directly to <HI>Edenborough;</HI> where he found plenty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en|ters</HI> Eden|borough.</NOTE> of all things which he wanted, and good accommodation for the refre&s;h|ing his Army; which &s;tood in need of it.</P>
<P>NEVER Victory was attended with le&s;s lamentations: for as <HI>Crom|well</HI> had great argument of Triumph in the total defeat and de&s;truction of the only Army that was in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which defeat had put a great part of that Kingdom, and the chief City of it, under his obedience; &s;o the King, who was then at S^t <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s, was glad of it, as the greate&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gets Advantage by this.</NOTE> happine&s;s that could befall him, in the lo&s;s of &s;o &s;trong a Body of his Enemies; who, if they &s;hould have prevailed, his Maje&s;ty did believe that they would have &s;hut him up in a Pri&s;on the next day; which had been only a &s;tricter confinement than he &s;uffer'd already: for the Lord <HI>Lorne,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> being Captain of his Guard, had &s;o watchful a care of him both night and day, that his Maje&s;ty could not go any whither without his leave. But, after this defeat, they all looked upon the King as one they might &s;tand in need of: they per|mitted his Servants, who had been &s;eque&s;ter'd from him from his Ar|rival in the Kingdom, to attend, and wait upon him, and begun to talk of calling a Parliament, and of a time for the King's Coronation; which <MILESTONE N="30"> had not hitherto been &s;poken of. Some Mini&s;ters begun to Preach obe|dience to the King; <Q>the Officers, who had been ca&s;hier'd for their Ma|lignity, talked a loud of &startq;the mi&s;carriages in the Government, and that the Kingdom was betrayed to the Enemy for want of confidence&endq; in the King, who alone could pre&s;erve the Nation.</Q> They of the Coun|cil &s;eem'd not to have &s;o ab&s;olute a dependence upon the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> but &s;poke more freely than they had u&s;ed to do; and the Mar|quis applied him&s;elf more to the King, and to tho&s;e about him: &s;o that the King did, in a good degree, enjoy the fruit of this Victory, as well <MILESTONE N="40"> as <HI>Cromwell,</HI> though his Maje&s;ty's advantage was di&s;cern'd by a few Men only, and tho&s;e reduced into an ob&s;cure quarter of the Kingdom; but the other made the <HI>&eacute;clat.</HI> The de&s;truction of the only Army, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> was looked upon, in all places, as the entire conque&s;t of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P><Q>DON <HI>Alonzo</HI> made ha&s;t to &s;end the News into <HI>Spain</HI> of &startq;the total and irrecoverable defeat of the King; that he was driven into the High|lands; from whence he would be compelled to fly, a&s;&s;oon as he could get means to e&s;cape: that the Republick was now &s;ettled, and no&endq; more fear or hope of the King:</Q> the effect of all which, the Emba&s;&s;a|dours <MILESTONE N="50"> quickly found at <HI>Madrid,</HI> by the carriage and countenance of that King and the Council; though it cannot be denied that the Common People appear'd to have a much more generous &s;en&s;e of the Alteration,
<PB N="295" REF="3110">
than the others did. <Q>The Emba&s;&s;adours receiv'd &s;hortly a full adverti&s;e|ment of the truth; and &startq;that the King thought his condition much im|prov'd&endq; by the defeat;</Q> and they u&s;ed all the means they could, by &s;e|veral Audiences, to inform the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis</HI> of the truth; <Q>and &startq;that they were mi&s;inform'd, as if the Army overthrown was the King's; whereas they were indeed as much his Enemies, as&endq; <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s was.</Q> But in this they could obtain no credit, and all ways were taken to make them perceive, that it was heartily wi&s;h'd they were gone; which they were re&s;olv'd to take no notice of.</P>
<P><Q>IN the end, one morning, the Secretary of State came to them from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Secretary of State brings a Me&s;&s;age from the King of</HI> Spain <HI>to the Emba&s;&s;adours to de&s;ire them to be gone.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="01"> the King; and told them, &startq;that they had been now above a year in that Court, where they had been well treated, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome mi&s;carriages, which might very ju&s;tly have incen&s;ed his Catholick Ma|je&s;ty&endq; (mentioning the death of <HI>A&s;cham)</HI></Q> <Q>&startq;that they were Extraordi|nary Emba&s;&s;adours, and &s;o needed not any Letters of Revocation; that they had receiv'd An&s;wers to all they had propo&s;ed, and were at liberty to depart; which his Catholick Maje&s;ty de&s;ir'd they would do,&endq; &s;ince their pre&s;ence in the Court would be very prejudicial to his Affairs.</Q> <Q>This unexpected and unu&s;ual Me&s;&s;age, deliver'd ungracefully enough by an old Man, who, notwith&s;tanding his Office, was look'd upon with <MILESTONE N="20"> little reverence to his parts, made them believe &startq;that he had mi&s;taken &startq;his Me&s;&s;age, at lea&s;t that he had deliver'd it with le&s;s courtly circum|&s;tances&endq; than he ought to have done.</Q> <Q>And therefore they return'd no other An&s;wer, than &startq;that they would attend <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> and&endq; under&s;tand from Him the King's plea&s;ure.</Q> The next day, they &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They apply to</HI> Don Lewis.</NOTE> for an Audience to <HI>Don Lewis;</HI> whom they found with a le&s;s open Countenance than he u&s;ed to have; nor did he appear any thing more courtly than the Secretary had done; but told them, that there were Orders &s;ent to &s;uch a Per&s;on (whom he named) to prepare their pre&s;ent; which &s;hould be ready within very few days; and pre&s;s'd them very <MILESTONE N="30"> plainly, and without any regard to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, it being then towards the end of <HI>January,</HI> to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible expedition for their de|parture, as a thing that, even in that re&s;pect, did exceedingly concern the &s;ervice of the King. This made the Emba&s;&s;adours imagine, which was likewi&s;e reported, that there was a formal Emba&s;&s;adour upon his way from <HI>England,</HI> and that the Court would be no more liable to the like Accidents. But they knew afterwards, that the cau&s;e of all this <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rea&s;on of their being pre&s;t to depart</HI> Madrid <HI>in &s;uch ha&s;t</HI></NOTE> ha&s;t was, that they might bring into the Town as many Pictures, and other choice and rich furniture, as did load eighteen Mules; which, as was &s;aid before, <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> had bought of the King's goods, and <MILESTONE N="40"> then &s;ent to the <HI>Groyne,</HI> and which they did not then think could be decently brought to the Palace, whil&s;t the Emba&s;&s;adours &s;hould continue and remain in the Town.</P>
<P>THIS injunction to leave <HI>Madrid,</HI> in &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a time of the year, was very &s;evere to the Emba&s;&s;adours. The Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> was at this time &s;eventy &s;ix years of Age, once or twice in a year troubled with the Gout, in other re&s;pects of great vigour of Body and Mind; nor did there appear in his natural parts any kind of decay. He had re|&s;olv'd, when he fir&s;t propo&s;ed this Emba&s;&s;y to the King, and, it may be, it was the chief rea&s;on of propo&s;ing it, that, if there &s;hould be no <MILESTONE N="50"> door open to let him return into <HI>England,</HI> by the time that his Em|ba&s;&s;y &s;hould expire, he would remain and die in <HI>Spain.</HI> But he did then believe, that he &s;hould have &s;ound another kind of Entertainment
<PB N="296" REF="3120">
there than he had done. He had, without doubt, de&s;erv'd very well from that Nation, having allways perform'd tho&s;e Offices towards them which made him look'd upon at home as too well affected to that Peo|ple, which, together with his con&s;tant oppo&s;ition of the <HI>French,</HI> had render'd him very ungracious to the Queen: yet there were &s;ome &s;ea|&s;ons, in which his credit and authority was not great enough to obtain all things for them which they de&s;ir'd, and expected; as when their Fleet, under the command of <HI>Oquendo,</HI> about the year 1639, had been a&s;&s;aulted in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and defeated by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, for want of that protection which they thought the King might have given to them. <MILESTONE N="10"> And it is probable their Emba&s;&s;adours, who were then in <HI>England,</HI> whereof <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> was one, did not find that readine&s;s and alacrity in him to appear in their &s;ervice, as they had formerly done; he very well knowing, that the being &s;ollicitous for them, in that conjuncture&punc; might do Him&s;elf harm, and could do Them no good. But the&s;e Omi&s;|&s;ions were now remember'd, and all his &s;ervices forgotten: &s;o that (as hath been touch'd before) his reception, from the fir&s;t hour of his coming la&s;t thither, was very cold both from the King and the Court. And though he was now willing to re&s;ume his former re&s;olution of &s;taying there; yet the treatment he had receiv'd, and this la&s;t farewel, made <MILESTONE N="20"> him doubt, very rea&s;onably, whether he &s;hould be permitted to &s;tay there or not.</P>
<P>THERE was another circum&s;tance, which was nece&s;&s;ary to his re&s;iding in <HI>Spain,</HI> in which he met with &s;ome difficulties that he had not fore|&s;een, and which did exceedingly perplex him; and which he plainly enough di&s;cern'd, and knew to be the true cau&s;e of all the di&s;counte|nance he had met with in that Court (though he was willing the other Emba&s;&s;adour, who knew nothing of it, &s;hould believe that it proceeded from what had pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>England)</HI> which was then remember'd in the di&s;cour&s;e of the Court, and was the true cau&s;e of the general prejudice <MILESTONE N="30"> to him there. He had been formerly reconciled in that Kingdom to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and had con&s;tantly gone to the Ma&s;s there; and declaring him&s;elf afterwards in <HI>England</HI> to be of the Religion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he was Apo&s;tatiz'd from the other; which, in that Country, is look'd upon as &s;uch a Brand, as the infamy of it can never be wiped out; and this indeed was the rea&s;on of that King's &s;o notable aver&s;ion from him. The truth is, he had never made any enquiry into Religion to inform him&s;elf, but had conform'd to that which the Pro|vince he held obliged him to; and though he could never get the repu|tation in <HI>England</HI> of being well affected to that Church, and was all|ways <MILESTONE N="40"> look'd upon as mo&s;t inclin'd to the <HI>Roman,</HI> yet he convinced tho&s;e who would have taken advantage of that guilt, by being pre&s;ent at Prayers, and Sermons, and &s;ometimes receiving the Sacrament, as he did the very la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> he &s;tay'd in the <HI>Hague</HI> before he begun his journey towards <HI>Spain;</HI> and even after his arrival there, was con&s;tant at the reading the Common-prayers both morning, and evening, by their own Chaplain, in their Hou&s;e, as long as the Chaplain liv'd: and many, who knew him very well, did believe that if he had died in <HI>England,</HI> he would have died in the Communion of that Church. But there is no doubt, he did re&s;olve, from the time that he meant to remain and <MILESTONE N="50"> die in <HI>Spain,</HI> that he would become a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick again, which he thought to be a much ea&s;ier thing than it was; and that he might have been reconciled by any Prie&s;t in as private a manner as he could de&s;ire.
<PB N="297" REF="3130">
But when he con&s;ulted that affair with a Je&s;uit, who frequently came to the Hou&s;e, he found, that after an Apo&s;tacy, as they term'd it, it was not in the power of any Prie&s;t to reconcile him, but that it was re&s;erv'd to the Pope him&s;elf; who rarely gives the faculty to any but to his own Nuntio's. This obliged him to re&s;ort thither; which he could not ea&s;ily do without communicating it to the other Emba&s;&s;a|dour; towards whom this was the only &s;ecret he re&s;erv'd. And he found a way, as he thought, to elude him in this particular. He told him, &s;everal days, that the Nuntio had &s;ent him &s;uch, and &s;uch Me&s;|&s;ages by that Je&s;uit concerning tho&s;e Gentlemen who were in Pri&s;on, the &s;ub&s;tance whereof did not differ from what the <HI>Venetian</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dour <MILESTONE N="1$"> had formerly deliver'd from him: <Q>at la&s;t, he told him, &startq;that he found the Nuntio had &s;omewhat to &s;ay in that Affair which he would not communicate by Me&s;&s;age, but wi&s;h'd to &s;peak with him in private; for publickly he mu&s;t not be known to have any conference with him; and that hereupon he re&s;olv'd to go <HI>incognito</HI> in S^r <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI>'s&endq; Coach to him: which he did, and was then reconciled;</Q> and return'd home making &s;uch a relation of their conference to his Companion as he thought fit; and deliver'd the Nuntio's &s;alutation to him. But within two or three days he knew what the Affair was: for, be&s;ides that the Nuntio could not perform the Office alone, but was to have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two or three &s;o qualified, there was really care taken that the other Emba&s;&s;adour might know it. <Q>And, before that time, when they both vi&s;ited the Pre&s;ident <HI>de la Hazienda,</HI> who carried them into his Library, whil&s;t the other Emba&s;&s;adour was ca&s;ting his Eyes upon &s;ome Books (it being the be&s;t private Library in <HI>Madrid)</HI> the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> told the Pre&s;ident, &startq;that he was him&s;elf a Catholick, but that his Companion&endq; was an ob&s;tinate Heretick;</Q> of which the Pre&s;ident &s;ent him informa|tion the next day. But &s;ince him&s;elf forbore ever to communicate this &s;ecret to him, out of an opinion, it is very probable, that he might give &s;ome di&s;turbance to his re&s;olution, he likewi&s;e took no manner of no|tice of it to him to the minute of their parting.</P>
<P>THIS difficulty being over, there remain'd yet another; which was, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Cot|tington <HI>re|&s;olves to &s;tay as a private Man in</HI> Spain</NOTE> his having permi&s;&s;ion to &s;tay in that Country; <Q>for which he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to <HI>Don Lewis;</HI> mention'd &startq;his Age; his infirmity of the Gout; which would infallibly &s;eize upon him, if, in that &s;ea&s;on of the year, he &s;hould provoke it by an extraordinary Motion; in a word, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to make the journey. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> told him, he could an&s;wer him to part of what he &s;aid without &s;peaking to the King; that he mu&s;t not think of &s;taying with the Character of an Em|ba&s;&s;adour, nor of re&s;iding in <HI>Madrid,</HI> in how private a condition &s;oe|ver; if he de&s;ired any thing with the&s;e two re&s;traints, he would move&endq; the King in it.</Q> <Q>The other told him, &startq;that he &s;ubmitted to both the&s;e conditions; and only de&s;ired licence to re&s;ide in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> where he had liv'd many years, when the Court remain'd there, in the time of&endq; King <HI>Philip</HI> the third.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS place was not di&s;lik'd; and within few days, <HI>Don Lewis</HI> &s;ent him word &startq;that the King approv'd it; and that he &s;hould have a Letter to the chief Magi&s;trate there, to treat him with all re&s;pect; and that his Maje&s;ty would take care that he &s;hould not undergo any di&s;tre&s;s,&endq; but would &s;upply him as his nece&s;&s;ities required.</Q> And, &s;hortly after, a Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to the Emba&s;&s;adours to let them know, that the King had appointed &s;uch a day for to give them an Audience to take
<PB N="298" REF="3140">
their leave. This new importunity was as extraordinary as the former; however, they perform'd their Ceremonies; and about the beginning <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Emb$&s;&s;a|dours have A$dience of have. The Lord</HI> Cot|tington <HI>lives at</HI> Valladolid <HI>till he dies.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>March,</HI> after they had been in that Court near fifteen Months, they both left <HI>Madrid</HI> in the &s;ame hour: the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> taking his Cour&s;e for <HI>Valladolid;</HI> where he had the &s;ame Hou&s;e provided, and made ready for him by the care of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Je&s;uits there, in which he had dwelt at the time of his Agency, when the Court re&s;ided there; where he died within one year after, in the 77^t^h year of his Age.</P>
<P>HE was a very wi&s;e Man, by the great and long experience he had <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> in bu&s;ine&s;s of all kinds; and by his natural temper, which was not liable to any tran&s;port of Anger, or any other pa&s;&s;ion, but could bear con|tradiction, <MILESTONE N="10"> and even reproach, without being moved, or put out of his way: for he was very &s;teady in pur&s;uing what he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, and had a courage not to be frighted with any oppo&s;ition. It is true he was illiterate as to the Grammar of any Language, or the principles of any Science, but by his perfectly under&s;tanding the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> (which he &s;poke as a <HI>Spaniard)</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Languages, and having read very much in all, he could not be &s;aid to be ignorant in any part of Learning, Divinity only excepted. He had a very fine and extraor|dinary under&s;tanding in the Nature of Bea&s;ts and Birds, and above all <MILESTONE N="20"> in all kind of Plantations and Arts of Husbandry. He was born a Gen|tleman both by Father and Mother, his Father having a pretty entire Seat near <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> worth above two hundred pounds a year, which had de&s;cended from Father to Son for many hundred years, and is &s;till in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Elder Brother's Children, the Family having been allways Roman Catholick. His Mother was a <HI>Stafford,</HI> nearly allied to S^r <HI>Edward Stafford;</HI> who was Vice-Chamberlain to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and had been Emba&s;&s;adour in <HI>France;</HI> by whom this Gentleman was brought up, and was Gentleman of his Hor&s;e, and left one of his Executors of his will, and by him recommended to S^r <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> then Principal Secretary of State; who preferr'd him to S^r <HI>Charles</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Conwallis,</HI> when he went Emba&s;&s;adour into <HI>Spain,</HI> in the beginning of the reign of King <HI>James;</HI> where he remain'd, for the &s;pace of eleven or twelve years, in the condition of Secretary or Agent, without ever returning into <HI>England</HI> in all that time. He rai&s;ed by his own Virtue and Indu&s;try a very fair E&s;tate, of which, though the Revenue did not exceed above four thou&s;and pounds by the year; yet he had four very good Hou&s;es, and three Parks, the value whereof was not reckon'd into that computation. He liv'd very nobly, well &s;erv'd, and attended in his Hou&s;e; had a better Stable of Hor&s;es, better provi&s;ion for Sports (e&s;pe|cially <MILESTONE N="40"> of Hawks, in which he took great delight) than mo&s;t of his Qua|lity, and liv'd allways with great &s;plendour; for though he lov'd Money very well, and did not warily enough con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of getting it, he &s;pent it well all ways but in giving, which he did not affect. He was of an excellent humour, and very ea&s;y to live with; and, under a grave countenance, cover'd the mo&s;t of mirth, and cau&s;ed more, than any Man of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant di&s;po&s;ition. He never u&s;ed any Body ill, but u&s;ed many very well for whom he had no regard: his greate&s;t fault was, that he could di&s;&s;emble, and make Men believe that he lov'd them very well, when he cared not for them. He had not very tender Af|fections, <MILESTONE N="50"> nor Bowels apt to yearn at all objects which de&s;erv'd com|pa&s;&s;ion. He was heartily weary of the world, and no Man was more willing to die; which is an Argument that he had peace of Con&s;cience.
<PB N="299" REF="3150">
He left behind him a greater e&s;teem of his Parts, than love to his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE other Emba&s;&s;adour was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with much more courte&s;y <NOTE PLACE="marg">The other Em|ba&s;&s;adour di&s;|mi&s;s'd very courteou&s;ly.</NOTE> for when they heard that his Family remain'd at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and that he intended to go thither, and &s;tay there till he receiv'd other Orders from the King his Ma&s;ter, they gave him all di&s;patches thither which might be of u&s;e to him in tho&s;e parts. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> him|&s;elf u&s;ed many gracious Expre&s;&s;ions to him at his la&s;t Audience, and &s;ent afterwards to him a Letter for the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold;</HI> in which he expre&s;&s;ed the good opinion he had of the Emba&s;&s;adour; <Q>and com|manded <MILESTONE N="10"> &startq;that, whil&s;t he &s;hould choo&s;e to re&s;ide in tho&s;e parts, under his Government, he &s;hould receive all re&s;pect, and enjoy all Privileges&endq; as an Emba&s;&s;adour:</Q> <Q>and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> writ likewi&s;e to the Arch-Duke, and the Count of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna,</HI> &startq;to look upon him as His&endq; particular Friend:</Q> all which Ceremonies, though they co&s;t them no|thing, were of real benefit and advantage to the Emba&s;&s;adour: for be|&s;ides the treatment he receiv'd from the Arch-Duke him&s;elf in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> as Emba&s;&s;adour, &s;uch directions, or recommendations, were &s;ent to the Magi&s;trates at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> that he enjoyed the privilege of his Chapel, and all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were numerous then in that City, repaired <MILESTONE N="20"> thither with all freedom for their devotion, and the exerci&s;e of their Religion: which liberty had never been before granted to any Man there, and which the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, and the Roman Catho|licks of tho&s;e Nations, exceedingly murmur'd at, and u&s;ed all the En|deavours they could to have taken away, though in vain.</P>
<P>IN his pa&s;&s;age through <HI>France</HI> he waited upon the Queen Mother, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In his pa&s;|&s;age through</HI> France <HI>he waits on the Queen Mo|ther.</HI></NOTE> who receiv'd him very graciou&s;ly; and he found there, that the &s;ucce&s;s which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had obtain'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> (though the King was &s;till there, and in a better condition than before) had the &s;ame effect in the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> it gave over all thoughts of the King, as in a condition not only deplorable, but as ab&s;olutely de&s;perate. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THERE had, a little before, fallen out an accident that troubled <HI>France</HI> very much, and no le&s;s plea&s;ed <HI>Spain;</HI> which was the death of the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> a young Prince of great hope and expectation, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of the Prince of</HI> Orange.</NOTE> and of a &s;pirit that de&s;ired to be in Action. He had found, that the Peace between <HI>Spain</HI> and the Low-Countries, which his Father had been &s;o &s;ollicitous to make, even at his expiration, was not like to pre|&s;erve him in equal lu&s;tre to what the three former Princes had enjoyed; and therefore he wi&s;hed nothing more, than that an opportunity might be offer'd to enter upon the War. He complain'd loudly, that the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> had not ob&s;erv'd, nor perform'd, many of tho&s;e Conditions <MILESTONE N="40"> which it was obliged to do for the particular benefit of him, and his family: whereby he continued involv'd in many debts, which were un|ea&s;y to him; and &s;o, upon all occa&s;ions which fell out, he adher'd to that Party in the States which were known mo&s;t to favour the Intere&s;t of <HI>France;</HI> which inclination the Cardinal, and the other Mini&s;ters of that Crown, u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible care and endeavour to cultivate: and <HI>Spain</HI> was &s;o much affected with the apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equence of that alteration, and with the con&s;cience of their own having promoted it, by not having complied with their obligations, that they re&s;olv'd to redeem their error, and to reconcile him again, if po&s;&s;ible, to them. <MILESTONE N="50"> To this purpo&s;e, a very great pre&s;ent was prepared at <HI>Madrid</HI> to be &s;ent to him, ten brave <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;es, the wor&s;t of which co&s;t there
<PB N="300" REF="3160">
three hundred pounds &s;terling, with many other rarities of great value; and likewi&s;e a pre&s;ent of Plate, Jewels, and perfum'd Leather, to the Prince&s;s Royal his Wife; <Q>and a full a&s;&s;urance, &startq;that they would forth. with begin to perform all the Articles which were to be done by them,&endq; and fini&s;h all within a &s;hort time.</Q></P>
<P>THE Expre&s;s, who was appointed to accompany the pre&s;ent, and to perform the other functions, was to begin his journey within two days, when the News arriv'd, by an Expre&s;s from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> who came in as &s;hort a time as could be imagin'd, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was dead of the &s;mall Pox, and had left the Prince&s;s with Child, and very near <MILESTONE N="10"> her time; who was brought to bed of a Son within few days after his <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Prince&s;s deliver'd of a Son &s;hortly af|ter.</NOTE> decea&s;e. The Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> could not conceal its joy, nor di&s;&s;emble their opinion, that the Enemy who&s;e influence they mo&s;t apprehended, was fortunately taken out of the way. On the other hand, <HI>France</HI> own'd a great &s;orrow and grief for the lo&s;s of a Man whom they believ'd to be more than ordinarily affected to them; and who, by a conjunction with their Friends in <HI>Holland,</HI> might, in a &s;hort time, be much &s;uperior to that Party in the States which adher'd to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT no body receiv'd &s;o in&s;upportable prejudice, and damage, by this fatal blow, as the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> did; towards whom that <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King lo&s;t a &s;ure Friend in the Prince.</NOTE> brave Prince gave all the te&s;timony and manife&s;tation of the mo&s;t entire, fa&s;t, and un&s;haken Affection and Friend&s;hip, that hath ever been per|form'd towards any Per&s;on under any &s;ignal misfortune. <Q>Be&s;ides the a&s;&s;i&s;ting him upon &s;everal emergent occa&s;ions, with greater Sums of Money than were ea&s;y to his incumber'd fortune, his reputation, and his declared re&s;olution, &startq;that he would venture all he had in that quar|rel,&endq; di&s;po&s;ed many to be more concern'd for his Maje&s;ty.</Q> Though he could not prevail over that Faction in <HI>Holland,</HI> which were known to favour <HI>Cromwell</HI> (and the more out of their aver&s;ion to him, and to his power and greatne&s;s) to induce them to &s;erve the King, yet he kept the <MILESTONE N="30"> States General from con&s;enting to that infamous Alliance and Con|junction, which, &s;hortly after his death, they enter'd into with the new Republick; and which they would never have yielded to, if He had liv'd. And, no doubt, the re&s;pect both <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had for him, and his interpo&s;ition, had prevailed with both to be more re&s;train'd than they afterwards appear'd to be, in a total declining all con&s;ideration of the King, and rejecting all thoughts of his Re&s;toration. It contributed very much to the negligent Farewel the Emba&s;&s;adous had receiv'd in <HI>Spain:</HI> for the news of the Prince's death had arriv'd there &s;ome time before their departure; and it did not only extingui&s;h all imaginations <MILESTONE N="40"> in <HI>France</HI> of any po&s;&s;ible hope for our King, but very much le&s;&s;en'd the re&s;pect, and civility, which that Court had allways &s;hew'd to the Queen her &s;elf, as a Daughter of <HI>France;</HI> towards whom they expre&s;&s;ed not that regard they had formerly done.</P>
<P>BUT there was another accident, which, at this time, gave the Queen more trouble than this; and of which her Maje&s;ty made great complaint to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at his return from <HI>Spain.</HI> Upon the Interview which had been between the King and the Queen at <HI>Beauvais,</HI> when the King went for <HI>Holland,</HI> upon the fore&s;ight, if not the re&s;olution, that it would be fit for him to adventure his own Per|&s;on <MILESTONE N="50"> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had left his Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI> with the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Touching the Duke of</HI> York <HI>left with the Queen.</HI></NOTE> Queen, with direction <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould conform him&s;elf entirely to the will and plea&s;ure of the Queen his Mother, matters of Religion only&endq;
<PB N="301" REF="3170">
excepted.</Q> And there was the le&s;s doubt of his conformity to her com|mands, becau&s;e, be&s;ides his piety and duty, which was very entire to|wards her, he was to depend wholely upon Her bounty for his Support; the Court of <HI>France</HI> not taking any notice of this increa&s;e of her ex|pence, nor paying her own narrow a&s;&s;ignation with any punctuality; &s;o that &s;he was not able, be&s;ides the re&s;ervedne&s;s in her Nature, &s;o to &s;upply him as to make his condition plea&s;ant to him; but exerci&s;ed the &s;ame au&s;tere carriage towards Him, which &s;he had done to the Prince his Brother, and as un&s;ucce&s;sfully. The Duke was very young, with a numerous Family of his own, not well enough inclined to be contented, <MILESTONE N="10"> and con&s;i&s;ting of Per&s;ons who lov'd not one another, nor their Ma&s;ter well enough to con&s;ider him before them&s;elves: which wrought that effect upon him, that none of them had that credit with him, that, at &s;uch an Age, &s;ome good Men ought to have had: which proceeded from want of rea&s;onable providence and circum&s;pection. For when he made his E&s;cape out of <HI>England</HI> (as is mention'd before) he had only one Per&s;on attending him (who had, before, no relation or pretence to his Service) who&s;e merit might have been otherwi&s;e requited, than by giving him a title and dependence upon him; and he quickly appear'd to be &s;o unworthy of it, that he was remov'd from it. Then was the <MILESTONE N="20"> time that &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould have been placed about him, as might have both di&s;cover'd &s;uch infirmities, as his Nature might incline him to, and have infu&s;ed tho&s;e Principles of Virtue, and Honour, as he was mo&s;t capable of, and di&s;po&s;ed to; and which had been as proper for his pre&s;ent misfortune, as for his highe&s;t dignity. But that Province was wholely committed to the Queen his Mother by the late King, who was then in Pri&s;on; and her Maje&s;ty being then at <HI>Paris,</HI> when the Duke landed in <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;he could not deliberate &s;o long upon it as &s;uch a &s;ubject required; and &s;o was per&s;waded by others to con&s;ider Them more than her Son; and made ha&s;t to put &s;uch a family about him, <MILESTONE N="30"> with reference to the number, and to the Offices which they were de|&s;ign'd to &s;erve in, as was above the greatne&s;s to which the younger Son of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> could pretend, by the u&s;age and cu&s;tom of that Kingdom, when it was in the greate&s;t &s;plendour; and all this, when there was not in view the lea&s;t Revenue to &s;upport it, but that the whole charge and burthen of it mu&s;t inevitably fall upon Her; of which her Maje&s;ty was quickly &s;en&s;ible, and paid the penalty at lea&s;t in the peace and quiet of her mind.</P>
<P>THE Duke was full of Spirit and Courage, and naturally lov'd de|&s;igns, and de&s;ired to engage him&s;elf in &s;ome Action that might improve and advance the low condition of the King his Brother; towards whom <MILESTONE N="40"> he had an inviolable Affection and Fidelity, &s;uperior to any temptation. He was not plea&s;ed with the treatment he receiv'd in <HI>France,</HI> nor had confidence enough in any of his Servants, to be advi&s;ed by them towards the contriving any expedient that he might rea&s;onably di&s;po&s;e him&s;elf to, or to be di&s;&s;waded from any Enterpri&s;e which his own pa&s;&s;ion might &s;ugge&s;t to him; though too many had too much credit with him in con|tributing to his di&s;contents, and in repre&s;enting the uncomfortablene&s;s of his own condition to him; <Q>&startq;the little regard the Queen appear'd to have of him, the lu&s;tre that &s;ome of her Servants liv'd in, and tho&s;e who depended upon them, whil&s;t his Royal Highne&s;s wanted all that <MILESTONE N="50"> was nece&s;&s;ary, and his Servants were expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t &s;candalous&endq; nece&s;&s;ities and contempt;</Q> which &s;ugge&s;tions, by degrees, began to
<PB N="302" REF="3180">
abate that reverence in him to the Queen his Mother, to which he was very dutifully inclined.</P>
<P>THERE were at that time two Per&s;ons, who, though without any relation to the Court, very much frequented the Duke's lodgings, and had frequent di&s;cour&s;es with him, S^r <HI>Edward Herbert,</HI> the late King's <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Edward Herbert <HI>and S^r</HI> G. Ratcliff <HI>have great in|tere&s;t in him.</HI></NOTE> Atturney General (of whom much is &s;aid before) and S^r <HI>George Rat|cliff,</HI> who had been de&s;ign'd by that King to attend upon the Duke of <HI>York</HI> into <HI>Ireland,</HI> when he once thought of &s;ending him thither. But that de&s;ign being quickly laid a&s;ide, there was no more thought of u&s;ing his Service there. The Duke looked upon them both as wi&s;e Men, and fit to give him advice; and finding that they both applied them&s;elves <MILESTONE N="10"> to him with diligence, and addre&s;s, he communicated his thoughts more freely to Them than to any others. And they took pains to per&s;wade him to di&s;like the condition he was in, and that he might &s;pend his time more to his advantage in &s;ome other place than in <HI>France.</HI> <Q>They &s;poke <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They recom|mend to him the pattern of the Duke of</HI> Lorraine.</NOTE> often to him of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> &startq;as a pattern and example for all unfortunate Princes to follow: that he being, by the power and in|ju&s;tice of the King of <HI>France,</HI> driven out of his Principality and Do|minions, had, by his own Virtue and Activity, put him&s;elf in the head of an Army; by which he made him&s;elf &s;o con&s;iderable, that he was courted by both the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and might <MILESTONE N="20"> make his conditions with either according to his own election; and in the mean time liv'd with great reputation, and in great plenty, e&s;teem'd&endq; by all the world for his courage and conduct.</Q> With the&s;e, and the like di&s;cour&s;es, the Duke was much plea&s;ed, and amu&s;ed, and wi&s;h'd in him&s;elf that he could be put into &s;uch a condition, when in truth there could not a more improper Example have been propo&s;ed to him, who&s;e condition was more unlike his, or who&s;e fortune and manners he was le&s;s to wi&s;h to follow, or le&s;s able to imitate. For the Duke of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Lorraine<HI>'s Character.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lorraine</HI> had, for many years before his misfortunes, had a great name in War, and was looked upon as one of the greate&s;t Captains of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom;</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> and had drawn the Armes, and power of <HI>France</HI> upon him, by his incon&s;tancy, and adhering to <HI>Spain,</HI> contrary to his Treaty and obli|gation with the other Crown; and when he was driven out of his own Country, and not able to defend it, he was in the head of a very good Army, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great Wealth, which he carried with him, and could not but be very welcome, as he well knew, into <HI>Flanders,</HI> both as his misfortune proceeded from his Affection to their King, and as his Forces were nece&s;&s;ary for their defence. And &s;o he made &s;uch con|ditions with them, as were mo&s;t beneficial to him&s;elf, and yet, in the <MILESTONE N="40"> con&s;equence, &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, as might well terrify all other Princes from treading in the &s;ame foot&s;teps.</P>
<P>WITH the report of the defeat of that Army by <HI>Cromwell</HI> in <HI>Scot|land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King be|liev'd in</HI> France <HI>to be dead.</HI></NOTE> (which was the fir&s;t good fortune to the King) or &s;hortly after, &s;ome Letters from <HI>England</HI> brought Intelligence, without any ground, that the King was dangerou&s;ly &s;ick; and, &s;hortly after, that he was dead; which was believ'd in <HI>England,</HI> and from thence tran&s;mitted into <HI>France.</HI> This gave a new Alarm to tho&s;e two Gentlemen mention'd before, who receiv'd this information from &s;uch Friends in <HI>England,</HI> that they did really believe it to be true; and thereupon concluded, that both the <MILESTONE N="50"> place and the company would not be fit for the new King to be found in: and therefore that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to remove from thence, before the report &s;hould be confirm'd, and believ'd.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="3190">
<Q>WHETHER they imparted this nice con&s;ideration to the Duke or not, his Highne&s;s, without any preface of the motives, told the Queen, &startq;&endq;he was re&s;olv'd to make a journey to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI></Q> who, being exceedingly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>ac|quaints his Mother that he will go to</HI> Bru&s;&s;els; <HI>Whi|ther he gos$.</HI></NOTE> &s;urpri&s;ed, ask'd him the rea&s;on; <Q>and &startq;&endq;how he could be able to make &s;uch a journey:</Q> which &s;he in truth believ'd impo&s;&s;ible for him, &s;ince &s;he knew he had no Money. <Q>His An&s;wer in &s;hort was, &startq;that he would vi&s;it the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who had been allways a friend to his Father, and continued his Affection to the King his Brother; and he had &s;ome rea&s;on to believe, that Duke would enable him to appear in action, that might be for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; and that he was re&s;olv'd to be|gin&endq; his journey the next day;</Q> from which, neither the Queen's advice, <MILESTONE N="10"> nor Authority, could divert him. Her Maje&s;ty quickly di&s;cern'd, that neither the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> nor S^r <HI>John Berkeley,</HI> nor M^r <HI>Bennet,</HI> his Se|cretary, knew any thing of it; and therefore ea&s;ily concluded who the Coun&s;ellors were; who were both very ungracious to her, and &s;he had long done all &s;he could to le&s;&s;en the Duke's e&s;teem of them. They well fore&s;aw that the want of Money would be of that force, that, without any other difficulty, the journey would be render'd impo&s;&s;ible. They had therefore, upon their own credit, or out of their own &s;tore, pro|cur'd as much as would defray the journey to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI> which, by the <MILESTONE N="20"> Duke's directions, was put into the hands of S^r <HI>George Ratcliffe,</HI> and to be managed by his providence and di&s;cretion. And then he publickly declar'd his re&s;olution to begin his journey the next day for <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> leaving his Servants to make what &s;hift they could to &s;tay there, or follow him.</P>
<P>SINCE there was no remedy, the Queen thought it nece&s;&s;ary that his chief Servants &s;hould wait on him, that &s;he might receive an Account what progre&s;s he made, and what his de&s;ign could be: &s;o the Lord <HI>By|ron,</HI> and M^r <HI>Bennet,</HI> made them&s;elves ready for the journey; S^r <HI>John Berkeley</HI> choo&s;ing to &s;tay behind, that he might not appear inferior where he had exerci&s;ed the &s;upreme Charge. And &s;o, with the other <MILESTONE N="30"> two Coun&s;ellors, and many of the inferiour Servants, the Duke, ac|cording to his re&s;olution, left the Queen; and, when he came to <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els,</HI> he lodged at the Hou&s;e of S^r <HI>Henry de Vic</HI> the King's Re&s;ident, without being taken notice of by any of that Court. There the two Coun|&s;ellors begun to form his family, and to confer Offices upon tho&s;e who were mo&s;t acceptable to them; pre&s;uming that they &s;hould &s;hortly re|ceive News from <HI>England,</HI> which would confirm all that they had done under other titles. In the mean time the Government of the Hou&s;e, and ordering the expence, was committed wholely to S^r <HI>George Ratcliff,</HI> whil&s;t the other contented him&s;elf with pre&s;iding in the Coun&s;els, and <MILESTONE N="40"> directing all the politick de&s;igns. The Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> had vi&s;ited the Duke upon his fir&s;t arrival, and being inform'd of the &s;treights his Royal Highne&s;s was in, pre&s;ented him with one thou&s;and Pi&s;tols. But now the &s;ecret ground of all their Coun&s;els, was found to be without any reality: the King was not only alive, and in good health, but known to be in the head of an Army that look'd <HI>Cromwell</HI> in the face; which de&s;troy'd all the Machine they had rai&s;ed: yet, being too far embark'd to retire with any grace, and being encouraged by the civility the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> had &s;hew'd towards the Duke, they had the pre&s;umption to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His two Coun|&s;ellors propo&s;e a Match for him with the Duke of</HI> $or $ame<HI>'s $a&s;tard Da$g$$$$.</HI></NOTE> propo&s;e that there might be a Marriage between the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and <MILESTONE N="$$"> the daughter of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> by the Counte&s;s of <HI>Canteeroy;</HI> whom he had publickly married, but which Marriage was declar'd
<PB N="304" REF="3200">
at <HI>Rome</HI> to be void, by rea&s;on that his former Wife was &s;till alive.</P>
<P>WHEN the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> &s;aw how the Affairs of this young Prince were conducted, and that the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> and M^r <HI>Bennet,</HI> who were Men well bred, and able to have di&s;cour&s;ed any bu&s;ine&s;s to him, one whereof was his Governour and the other his Secretary, who by their Offices ought to be more tru&s;ted in an Affair of that moment, were not at all acquainted with it, and that the other two Per&s;ons, who were Men of a very unu&s;ual mien, appear'd in it, and that only S^r <HI>George Ratcliff</HI> undertook to &s;peak to him about it, who could only make him|&s;elf under&s;tood in <HI>Latin,</HI> which the Duke cared not to &s;peak in, he de|clin'd entertaining the motion, till he might know that it was made <MILESTONE N="10"> with the King's approbation; <Q>which the other did not pretend it to be, but &startq;that he did not doubt it would be afterwards approv'd by his Ma|je&s;ty.&endq;</Q> Thus they were at the end of their projects; and there being no means to &s;tay longer at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> they per&s;waded the Duke to vi&s;it his Si&s;ter at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and there to con&s;ider, and advi&s;e what was next <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke vi|&s;its his Si&s;ter at the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> to be done.</P>
<P>OF all the&s;e particulars the Queen complain'd to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with great bitterne&s;s again&s;t the folly and pre&s;umption of tho&s;e two Gentlemen, who&s;e fidelity to the King &s;he did not &s;u&s;pect; nor could &s;he imagine the motive that had engaged them in &s;uch a bold <MILESTONE N="20"> undertaking; <Q>but &s;he requir'd him, &startq;that, a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hould come into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he would make a journey to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and prevail with&endq; the Duke (to whom &s;he writ to the &s;ame purpo&s;e)</Q> <Q>&startq;to return again&endq; to <HI>Paris,</HI> which the Chancellor promi&s;ed to endeavour heartily to do, being exceedingly troubled at the general di&s;cour&s;e, which that Sally had admini&s;ter'd, as if there were a Schi&s;m in the Royal family in a &s;ea&s;on when &s;o much union was requi&s;ite.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was another in&s;tance of the King's extreme low condition, and of the highe&s;t di&s;re&s;pect the Court of <HI>France</HI> could expre&s;s towards him, and of which all the Prote&s;tant Party of the Queen's family com|plain'd <MILESTONE N="30"> very vehemently. From the time of the Queen's being in <HI>France,</HI> the late King had appointed a Chaplain of his own, D^r <HI>Co&s;ins,</HI> who was afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> to attend upon her Maje&s;ty for the con|&s;tant &s;ervice of that part of her Hou&s;hold, the number of her Prote&s;tant Servants being much &s;uperior to tho&s;e who were Roman Catholicks.

An under room in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> out of any common pa&s;&s;age, had been a&s;&s;ign'd for their morning and evening devotions; the Key whereof was committed to <MILESTONE N="40"> the Chaplain; who cau&s;ed the room to be decently furni&s;h'd, and kept; being made u&s;e of to no other purpo&s;e.

with the Queen, which he had the more title to do, becau&s;e, at his go|ing into <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;he had vouch&s;afed to promi&s;e him (upon &s;ome Rumours, of which he took notice) <Q>&startq;that the &s;ame Privilege which had been, &s;hould &s;till be continued, and enjoy'd by the Prote&s;tants of her Hou&s;hold; and that &s;he would provide for the Chaplain's Sub&s;i&s;tence.

<P><Q>WHEN the Chancellor of the Exchequer came to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> with a purpo&s;e to make a journey &s;peedily to the <HI>Hague,</HI> he was inform'd, &startq;that the States were much offended that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> remain'd there;&endq; and therefore that the Prince&s;s Royal (who now more depended upon their favour than ever;</Q> <Q>her own joynture, as well as the fortune of her Son, being to be be &s;etled in their judicatory) &startq;could no longer enter|tain&endq; him, but that he would be the next day at <HI>Breda.</HI></Q> Thither the Chancellor immediately went; and found the Duke there with a fa|mily <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor finds the Duke of</HI> York <HI>at</HI> Breda&punc; <HI>and the &s;actions of the Duke's family there.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> in all the confu&s;ion imaginable, in pre&s;ent want of every thing, and not knowing what was to be done next. They all cen&s;ur'd and re|proach'd the Coun&s;el by which they had been guided, and the Coun&s;ellors as bitterly inveigh'd again&s;t each other, for undertaking many things which had no foundation in truth. They who concurr'd in nothing el&s;e, were equally &s;evere again&s;t the Atturney, as a Man of that intolerable pride that it was not po&s;&s;ible for any Man to conver&s;e with him. He as frankly reproach'd them all with being Men of no parts, of no under|&s;tanding, nor learning, no principles, and no re&s;olution, and was &s;o ju&s;t to them all, as to contemn every Man of them alike. In truth he had <MILESTONE N="20"> render'd him&s;elf &s;o grievous to them all, that there was no Man who de&s;ir'd to be in his Company; yet, by the knack of his talk, which was the mo&s;t like rea&s;on without being it, he retain'd &s;till too much credit with the Duke; who, being amu&s;ed and confounded with his po&s;itive di&s;cour&s;e, thought him to be wi&s;er than tho&s;e who were more ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood; and was him&s;elf &s;o young, that he was rather delighted with the journeys he had made, than &s;en&s;ible that he had not enter'd upon them with rea&s;on enough; and was fortified with a firm re&s;olution never to acknowledge that he had committed any error. However, he was <MILESTONE N="30"> very glad to receive the Queen's Letter, which the Chancellor deliver'd to him; heard his advice very willingly, and re&s;olv'd to begin his jour|ney to <HI>Paris</HI> without any delay; and look'd upon the occa&s;ion, as a very &s;ea&s;onable redemption. The next day he went to <HI>Antwerp;</HI> and from thence, with the &s;ame retinue he had carried with him, made ha&s;t to <HI>Paris,</HI> and was receiv'd by the Queen his Mother without tho&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke re|turns to</HI> Paris <HI>$$ the Queen.</HI></NOTE> expo&s;tulations and reprehen&s;ions which he might rea&s;onably have ex|pected; though her &s;everity was the &s;ame towards all tho&s;e, who, &s;he thought, had had the credit and power to &s;educe him; and they were not &s;ollicitous, by any Apologies or Confe&s;&s;ion, to recover her favour: for the true rea&s;on that had &s;way'd them being not to be avow'd, any <MILESTONE N="40"> other that they could devi&s;e and &s;ugge&s;t, would have render'd them more inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>DURING this time, the King underwent all kind of Mortifications <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's af|fairs in</HI> Scot|land.</NOTE> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But after the defeat of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Army in <HI>September,</HI> with which the King and <HI>Cromwell</HI> were equally delighted, as hath been &s;aid before, the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Empire &s;eem'd not to be &s;o ab|&s;olute. A new Army was appointed to be rai&s;ed; the King him&s;elf in|terpo&s;ed more than he had done; and the Noblemen and Officers came to him with more confidence; and his Maje&s;ty took upon him to com|plain <MILESTONE N="50"> and expo&s;tulate, when tho&s;e things were done which he did not like: Yet the power was &s;till in <HI>Argyle</HI>'s hands; who, under all the profe&s;&s;ions of humility, exerci&s;ed &s;till the &s;ame Tyranny; in&s;omuch as
<PB N="307" REF="3230">
the King grew weary of his own patience, and re&s;olv'd to make &s;ome attempt to free him&s;elf. D^r <HI>Frazier,</HI> who had been the King's Phy&s;ician many years before, and had con&s;tantly attended upon his Per&s;on, and very much contributed to the King's journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> was, &s;hortly after his coming thither, di&s;liked by <HI>Argyle;</HI> who knew that he was a Creature of the <HI>Hamiltonians,</HI> and found him to be of an unquiet and over active Spirit; and thereupon &s;eque&s;ter'd him from his attendance. There were many Officers who had &s;erv'd in Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Engage|ment, as <HI>Middleton,</HI> and others, who had very entire Affections for the King; and many of them had corre&s;ponded with <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"> re&s;olv'd to have joyn'd with him; and finding them&s;elves excluded, as all of them were, from any employment by the power of <HI>Argyle,</HI> had retired into the High-lands, and remain'd there conceal'd in expectation of &s;ome good Sea&s;on, in which they might avowedly appear. With &s;ome of the&s;e D^r <HI>Frazier</HI> had held corre&s;pondence whil&s;t he was in the Court, and had often &s;poken to the King of their Affection, and readi|ne&s;s to &s;erve him, and of their power to do it, and had return'd his Ma|je&s;ty's gracious Acceptation of their Service, and his re&s;olution to em|ploy them. And now not being him&s;elf &s;uffer'd to come to the Court, he found means to meet and confer with many of them; and held In|telligence <MILESTONE N="20"> with the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who had allways great confidence in him; and the Officers undertaking to do more than they could, or the D^r under&s;tanding them to undertake more than they did (for his fi|delity was never &s;u&s;pected) he gave the King &s;uch an Account of their numbers, as well as re&s;olutions, that his Maje&s;ty appointed a day for their Rendezvous, and promi&s;ed to be pre&s;ent with them, and then to publi&s;h a Declaration (which was likewi&s;e prepared) of the ill treat|ment he had endured, and again&s;t the Per&s;on of <HI>Argyle;</HI> to whom the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> gave him&s;elf wholely up, and imparted to him all this corre&s;pondence, having found &s;ome of the Letters which had pa&s;&s;ed, <MILESTONE N="30"> by the King's having left his Cabinet open; for he was not at all tru&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Argyle</HI> did not think the time &s;o near; &s;o that the King did <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Span$</NOTE> pro&s;ecute this purpo&s;e &s;o far, that he rode one day, with a dozen or twenty Hor&s;e, into the High-lands, and lodged there one Night; nei|ther the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> nor any body el&s;e, knowing what was be|come of him; which put them all into great di&s;traction. It was indeed a very empty and unprepared de&s;ign, contriv'd and conducted by D^r <HI>Frazier,</HI> without any foundation to build upon; and might well have ruin'd the King. It was afterwards called the <HI>Start;</HI> yet it prov'd, con|trary <MILESTONE N="40"> to the expectation of wi&s;e Men, very much to his Maje&s;ty's ad|vantage. For though he was compell'd the next day to return, with a <NOTE PLACE="marg">But is per|&s;waded to $ turn the n$$t day</NOTE> circum&s;tance that &s;eem'd to have &s;omewhat of force in it (for as the Company he looked for failed to appear, &s;o there was a Troop of Hor&s;e, which he looked not for, &s;ent by <HI>Argyle,</HI> who u&s;ed very effectual in|&s;tance with him to return) yet notwith&s;tanding, this Declaration of his Maje&s;ty's re&s;entment, together with the ob&s;ervation of what the Peo|ple generally &s;poke upon it, <Q>&startq;that the King was not treated as he ought&endq; to be,</Q> made the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> change his Coun&s;els, and to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King $Span$ King's $Word$&punc;</NOTE> more &s;ollicitous to &s;atisfy the King. A Summons was &s;ent out, in the <MILESTONE N="50"> King's name, to call a Parliament; and great preparations were really made for the Coronation; and the Sea&s;on of the year, again&s;t which <HI>Cromwell</HI> was &s;ecuring him&s;elf in <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and making Provi&s;ions
<PB N="308" REF="3240">
for his Army, the Winter coming on, and the &s;trong pa&s;&s;es which were ea&s;y then to be guarded, hindred the Enemies advance: &s;o that the King re&s;ided, &s;ometimes at <HI>Sterling,</HI> and &s;ometimes at S^t <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It meets at</HI> Sterling, <HI>and reconciles the Lords.</HI></NOTE> with convenience enough. The Parliament met at <HI>Sterling,</HI> and &s;hortly after brought all the Lords of the other Party thither, who appear'd to have credit enough to wipe off tho&s;e &s;tains with which the Engagement had defaced them, yet with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;tand publickly in the Stool of Repentance, acknowledging their former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; as they all did.</P>
<P>DUKE <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Lautherdale</HI> were welcome to the King, and neare&s;t his confidence; which neither the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="10"> had ca&s;t off their friend&s;hip as unu&s;eful, nor the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> were plea&s;ed with. The King him&s;elf grew very popular, and, by his frequent conferences with the Knights and Burge&s;&s;es, got any thing pa&s;&s;ed in the Parliament which he de&s;ired. He cau&s;ed many infamous Acts to be repeal'd, and provided for the rai&s;ing an Army, whereof him&s;elf was General; and no exceptions were taken to tho&s;e Officers <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Army rai&s;ed, of which the King is Ge|neral.

<P>THE Coronation was pa&s;&s;ed with great &s;olemnity and magnificence, all Men making &s;hew of Joy, and of being united to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty: <MILESTONE N="20"> yet the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> pre&s;erv'd his greatne&s;s and intere&s;t &s;o well, and was &s;till &s;o con&s;iderable, that it was thought very expedient to rai&s;e an imagination in him, that the King had a purpo&s;e to marry one of his Daughters; which was carried &s;o far, that the King could no other|wi&s;e defend him&s;elf from it, than by &s;ending an Expre&s;s into <HI>France</HI> for the Queen his Mother's con&s;ent (which &s;eem'd not to be doubted of) and to that purpo&s;e Captain <HI>Titus,</HI> a Per&s;on grateful to <HI>Argyle,</HI> and to all the Presbyterian Party, was &s;ent; who, finding the Queen le&s;s warm upon the Propo&s;ition than was expected, made le&s;s ha&s;t back; &s;o that the fate of <HI>Scotland</HI> was fir&s;t determin'd. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE King's Army was as well modelled, and in as good a condition as it was like to be whil&s;t he &s;tayed in <HI>Scotland.</HI> By that time that <HI>Crom|well</HI> was ready to take the field, his Maje&s;ty was per&s;waded to make <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> his Lieutenant General of the Army; who had very long experience, and a very good Name in War; and <HI>Middleton</HI> commanded the Hor&s;e. The Artillery was in very good order under the command of <HI>Wemmes,</HI> who had not the wor&s;e reputation there for having been ungrateful to the King's Father. He was a confe&s;&s;ed good Officer; and there were, or could be, very few Officers of any Superior Command, but &s;uch who had drawn their Swords again&s;t his late Maje&s;ty; mo&s;t of <MILESTONE N="40"> tho&s;e who had &s;erv'd under the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> having been put to death. Many of the greate&s;t Noblemen had rai&s;ed Regiments, or Troops; and all the young Gentlemen of the Kingdom appear'd very hearty and chearful in Commands, or Voluntiers: and, in all ap|pearance, they &s;eem'd a Body equal in any re&s;pect, and &s;uperior in Num|ber, to the Enemy; which advanced all they could, and made it mani|fe&s;t that they de&s;ired nothing more than to come to Battle; which was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en|deavours to fight the King's Army.</HI></NOTE> not thought coun&s;ellable for the King's Army to engage in, except upon very notable Advantages; which they had rea&s;on every day to expect; for there was a very broad and a deep River between them; and if they <MILESTONE N="50"> kept the Pa&s;&s;es, of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and could hardly choo&s;e but keep, <HI>Cromwell</HI> mu&s;t in a very few days want Provi&s;ions, and &s;o be forced to retire, whil&s;t the King had plenty of all things which he &s;tood
<PB N="309" REF="3250">
in need of, and could, by the advantage of the Pa&s;&s;es, be in his Rere a&s;&s;oon as he thought fit.</P>
<P>IN this po&s;ture both Armies &s;tood in view of each other near the two <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Both Armies near each other in the Months of</HI> June <HI>and</HI> July.</NOTE> Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> with &s;ome &s;mall attempts upon each other, with equal Succe&s;s. About the end of <HI>July,</HI> by the cowardi&s;e or trea|chery of Major General <HI>Brown,</HI> who had a Body of four thou&s;and Men to keep it, <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Forces under <HI>Lambert</HI> gain'd the Pa&s;s, by which they got behind the King; and though they could not compel his Ma|je&s;ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>gains a Pa&s;s, and gets be|hind the King</HI></NOTE> to fight, for there was &s;till the great River between them, they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or might quickly be, of the mo&s;t fruitful part of the <MILESTONE N="10"> Country; and &s;o would not only have &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion for their own Army, but in a &s;hort time would be able to cut off much of that which &s;hould &s;upply the King's. This was a great &s;urpri&s;e to the King, and put him into new coun&s;els; and he did, with the unanimous Advice of allmo&s;t all the principal Officers, and all tho&s;e who were admitted to the Council, take a re&s;olution worthy of his Courage; which, how un|fortunate &s;oever it prov'd, was evidence enough that the &s;ame misfor|tune would have fallen out if he had not taken it.</P>
<P>THE King was now, by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s putting him&s;elf behind him, much nearer to <HI>England</HI> than He: nor was it po&s;&s;ible for him to over|take <MILESTONE N="20"> his Maje&s;ty, in regard of the ways he was unavoidably to pa&s;s, till after the King had been &s;ome days march before him: his Maje&s;ty's fate depended upon the Succe&s;s of one Battle: for a po&s;&s;ible E&s;cape into the High-lands, after a Defeat, there was no Kingly pro&s;pect: all the Northern parts of <HI>England</HI> had given him cau&s;e to believe that they were very well affected to his Service, and if he could reach tho&s;e Coun|tries, he might pre&s;ume to encrea&s;e his Army, which was numerous enough, with an Addition of &s;uch Men as would make it much more con&s;iderable. Hereupon, with the concurrence afore&s;aid, it was re&s;olv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|&s;olves to march into</HI> England.</NOTE> that the Army &s;hould immediately march, with as much Expedition as was po&s;&s;ible, into <HI>England,</HI> by the neare&s;t ways, which led into <HI>Lan|ca&s;hire,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> whither the King &s;ent Expre&s;&s;es to give tho&s;e, of whom he ex|pected much (by rea&s;on &s;ome of them had been in <HI>Scotland</HI> with him, with promi&s;e of large undertakings) notice of his purpo&s;e, that they might get their Soldiers together to receive him. <Q>His Maje&s;ty &s;ent like|wi&s;e an Expre&s;s to the I&s;le of <HI>Man,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> had &s;e|curely repo&s;ed him&s;elf from the end of the former War, &startq;that he &s;hould&endq; meet his Maje&s;ty in <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI></Q> The Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> was the only <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Argyle <HI>only di&s;&s;waded it and &s;tayed be|hind and re|tired to his Hou&s;e</HI></NOTE> Man who di&s;&s;waded his Maje&s;ty's march into <HI>England,</HI> with rea&s;ons which were not frivolous; but the contrary prevailed; and he &s;tayed behind; and, when the King begun his march, retired to his Hou&s;e in <MILESTONE N="40"> the High-lands. Some were of opinion, that he &s;hould then have been made Pri&s;oner, and left &s;o &s;ecured that he might not be able to do mi&s;|chief when the King was gone, which mo&s;t Men believ'd he would in|cline to. <Q>But his Maje&s;ty would not con&s;ent to it, becau&s;e he was con|fident &startq;he would not attempt any thing while the Army was entire: if it prevailed, he neither would, nor could do any harm; and if it&endq; were defeated, it would be no great matter what he did.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not frequently without good Intelligence what was done in the King's Army, and Councils, yet this la&s;t re&s;olu|tion was con&s;ulted with &s;o great &s;ecrecy, and executed with that won|derful <MILESTONE N="50"> expedition, that the King had marched a whole day without his comprehending what the meaning was, and before he receiv'd the lea&s;t

adverti&s;ement of it. It was not a &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e to him, nor was it ea&s;y <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell<HI>'s Re&s;olutions and Coun&s;els upon this News.</HI></NOTE> for him to re&s;olve what to do. If he &s;hould follow with his whole Ar|my, all the Advantages he had got in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would be pre&s;ently lo&s;t, and the whole Kingdom be again united in any new mi&s;chief. If he followed but with part, he might be too weak when he overtook the King; who&s;e Army, he knew, would bear the fatigue of a long march better than His could do. There were two con&s;iderations which trou|bled him exceedingly; the one, the terrible con&s;ternation he fore&s;aw the Parliament would be in, when they heard that the King with his Army was nearer to them, than their own Army was for their defence; <MILESTONE N="10"> and he knew that he had Enemies enough to improve their fear, and to le&s;&s;en his Conduct: the other was, the Apprehen&s;ion, that, if the King had time given to re&s;t in any place, he would infinitely encrea&s;e and &s;trengthen his Army by the re&s;ort of the People, as well as the Gentry and Nobility, from all parts. And though he did &s;o much un|dervalue the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, that he would have been glad to have found him&s;elf engaged with it, upon any inequality of Numbers, and di&s;ad|vantage of ground, yet he did believe, that, by a good mixture with <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they might be made very con&s;iderable. He took a very quick re&s;olution to provide for all the be&s;t he could: he di&s;patched an Expre&s;s <MILESTONE N="20"> to the Parliament, to prevent their being &s;urpri&s;ed with the News; <Q>and to a&s;&s;ure them, &startq;that he would him&s;elf overtake the Enemy be|fore&endq; they &s;hould give them any trouble;</Q> and gave &s;uch farther Orders for drawing the Auxiliary Troops together in the &s;everal Counties, as he thought fit.</P>
<P><Q>HE gave <HI>Lambert</HI> Order, &startq;immediately to follow the King with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orders</HI> Lam|bert <HI>to follow the King with a Body of Hor&s;e.</HI></NOTE> &s;even or eight hundred Hor&s;e, and to draw as many others, as he could, from the Country Militia; and to di&s;turb his Maje&s;ty's march the mo&s;t he could, by being near, and obliging him to march clo&s;e; not engaging his own Party in any &s;harp Actions, without a very notorious&endq; advantage;</Q> but to keep him&s;elf entire till he &s;hould come up to him. <MILESTONE N="30"> With this Order <HI>Lambert</HI> marched away the &s;ame day the adverti&s;e|ment came.</P>

WHEN <HI>Cromwell</HI> had di&s;patch'd all the&s;e Orders and Directions, with marvellous Expedition, and &s;een mo&s;t of them advanced in &s;ome de|gree, he begun his own March with the remainder of his Army, three <NOTE PLACE="marg">And follows the King three days after</NOTE> days after the King was gone, with a wonderful chearfulne&s;s, and a&s;|&s;urance to the Officers and Soldiers, that he &s;hould obtain a full Victory in <HI>England</HI> over tho&s;e who fled from him out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>THE King had, from the time that he had recover'd any Authority in <HI>Scotland,</HI> granted a Commi&s;&s;ion to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> to rai&s;e a Regiment of Hor&s;e which <HI>Ma&s;sey</HI> was to command under him, and to rai&s;e another Regiment of Foot.

And there were &s;ome who had li&s;ted them&s;elves accordingly; but the di&s;cipline the <HI>Scots</HI> had u&s;ed to the King, and their adhering to their old Principles, even after they &s;eem'd united for his Maje&s;ty, had kept the King's friends in <HI>England</HI> from repairing to them in <HI>Scotland.</HI> They who came from <HI>Holland</HI> with the King, had di&s;|po&s;ed them&s;elves as is &s;aid before, and there was little doubt but that, a&s;&s;oon as the King &s;hould enter <HI>England,</HI> tho&s;e two Regiments would be immediately full. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> had lo&s;t much ground (and the more becau&s;e the King was not plea&s;ed with it) by his having <MILESTONE N="20"> broken off all manner of friend&s;hip with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> (to whom he had profe&s;&s;ed &s;o much) and had enter'd into &s;o fa&s;t a conjunction with the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> their declar'd ir|reconcilable Enemy, and adhered &s;o firmly to him, when he was le&s;s dutiful to the King than he ought to have been. <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> had got a great Name by his defending <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> again&s;t the late King, and was look'd upon as a Martyr for the Presbyterian Intere&s;t, and &s;o very dear to that Party; and therefore, a&s;&s;oon as they came within the borders of <HI>England,</HI> he was &s;ent with &s;ome Troops before, and was allways to march at lea&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;ey <HI>&s;ent to march before the King.</HI></NOTE> a day before the Army, to the end that he might give notice of the King's <MILESTONE N="30"> coming, and draw the Gentry of the Counties through which he pa&s;s'd, to be ready to attend upon his Maje&s;ty.

<P>BUT it was fatal at that time to all <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Armies, to have allways in them a Committee of Mini&s;ters, who ruin'd all; and though there <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee of Mini&s;ters in the King's Army, who ruin all.</NOTE> had been now all the care taken that could be, to choo&s;e &s;uch Men for that &s;ervice as had the reputation of being the mo&s;t &s;ober, and mode|rate of that whole Body, and who had &s;hew'd more Affection, and ad|vanced <MILESTONE N="40"> the King's Service more than the re&s;t; yet this moderate Peo|ple no &s;ooner heard that <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> was &s;ent before to call upon their friends, and ob&s;erv'd that, from the entrance into <HI>England,</HI> tho&s;e about the King &s;eem'd to have le&s;s regard for the Covenant than formerly, but they &s;ent an Expre&s;s to him, without communicating it in the lea&s;t degree with the King, with Letters, and a Declaration, wherein they requir'd him <Q>&startq;to publi&s;h that Declaration, which &s;ignified the King's, and the whole Army's Zeal for the Covenant, and their re&s;olution to&endq; pro&s;ecute the true intent of it;</Q> <Q>and forbid him &startq;to receive or enter|tain any Soldiers in his Troops, but tho&s;e who would &s;ub&s;cribe that&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> obligation.</Q> <Q>The King had &s;oon notice of this, and lo&s;t no time in &s;end|ing to <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> &startq;not to publi&s;h any &s;uch Declaration, and to behave him|&s;elf with equal civility towards all Men who were forward to &s;erve&endq;

<P>IN <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> met him; who, a&s;&s;oon as he receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Derby <HI>met the King in</HI> Lanca&s;hire.</NOTE> his Summons, left the I&s;le of <HI>Man.</HI> When the King's Army came about <HI>Warrington</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> they found, that there was a Body of the Ene|my drawn up in a fair Field, which did not appear con&s;iderable enough to &s;top their march.

This Succe&s;s made a great noi&s;e, as if <HI>Lambert</HI> had been defeated.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Warrington</HI> it was thought Coun&s;ellable, very unfortunately, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At</HI> Warring|ton <HI>the Earl of</HI> Derby <HI>parts from the King, and is &s;ent to</HI> Lanca&s;hire <HI>with other Of|ficers to rai&s;e Forces.</HI></NOTE> that the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Withrington,</HI> and &s;everal other Officers of good name, &s;hould return into <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> in order to rai&s;e the well affected in tho&s;e two Counties of <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI> who <MILESTONE N="20"> could not come in upon &s;o quick a march, as the King had made: and yet it being out of the road that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was to follow, who was enter'd into <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> the remaining of tho&s;e Per&s;ons there, was thought a good Expedient to gather a Body of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which the King extremely de&s;ir'd: and if they found any great difficulties, they were to follow the Army. In order to which, the Earl had a Body of near two hundred Hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting, for the mo&s;t part, of Officers, and Gentlemen; which depriv'd the Army of a &s;trength they wanted; and was afterwards ac|knowledged to be a Coun&s;el too &s;uddainly enter'd upon.</P>
<P>UPON appearance of that Body of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s, the whole Army was drawn up, and appear'd very chearful. The King having ob&s;erv'd <HI>David</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> throughout the whole march, &s;ad and melancholy, and, at that time when the Enemy retired, and plainly in a quicker pace than a good retreat u&s;ed to be made, &s;low in giving Orders, and re&s;iding by him&s;elf, his Maje&s;ty rode up to him, and ask'd him, with great alacrity, <Q>&startq;how he could be &s;ad, when he was in the head of &s;o brave an Army? (which he &s;aid look'd well that day) and demanded of him, how he&endq; lik'd them?</Q> <Q>To which <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> an&s;wer'd him in his ear, being <NOTE PLACE="marg">David Le&s;ley<HI>'s &s;aying concern|ing the</HI> Scot|i&s;h <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> at &s;ome di&s;tance from any other, &startq;that he was melancholy indeed, for&endq; he well knew that Army,</Q> how well &s;oever it look'd, would not fight: <MILESTONE N="40"> which the King imputed to the chagrin of his humour, and gave it no credit, nor told it to any Man till, &s;ome years after, upon another oc|ca&s;ion which will be remember'd in it's place, he told the Chancellor of the Exchequer of it.</P>
<P>IT was not thought fit to pur&s;ue <HI>Lambert;</HI> who, being known to be a Man of Courage and Conduct, and his Troops to be of the be&s;t, was &s;u&s;pected, by &s;o di&s;orderly a Retreat, to have only de&s;ign'd to have drawn the Army another way, to di&s;order and di&s;turb their march; which they re&s;olv'd to continue with the &s;ame expedition they had hi|therto u&s;ed, which was incredible; until they &s;hould come to &s;uch a Po&s;t as they might &s;ecurely re&s;t them&s;elves. And there was an imagi|nation, <MILESTONE N="50"> that they might have continu'd it even to <HI>London;</HI> which would have produced wonderful Effects. But they quickly found that to be
<PB N="313" REF="3290">
impo&s;&s;ible, and that both Hor&s;e and Foot grew &s;o weary, that they mu&s;t have re&s;t: the weather was exceedingly hot; the march having been begun near the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> &s;o that if they had not &s;ome re&s;t before an Enemy approach'd them, how willing &s;oever they might be, they could not be able to fight.</P>
<P>THERE was a &s;mall Garri&s;on in <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> commanded by a Gen|tleman, who, it was thought, might be prevail'd with to give it up to the King; but his Maje&s;ty &s;ending to him, he return'd a rude denial: &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King &s;um|mons</HI> Shrews|bury <HI>in vain</HI></NOTE> that his Maje&s;ty's eye was upon <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> that was &s;o little out of his way to <HI>London,</HI> that the going thither would not much retard the march, <MILESTONE N="10"> if they found the Army able to continue it. <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> had allways been a place very well affected in it &s;elf, and mo&s;t of the Gentlemen of that County had been engaged for the King in the former War, and the City was the la&s;t that had &s;urrender'd to the Parliament, of all tho&s;e which had been Garri&s;on'd for his Maje&s;ty; when all the Works were thrown down, and no Garri&s;on from that time had been kept there; the Sheriff, and Ju|&s;tices, and Committees, having had power enough to defend it again&s;t any malignity of the Town, or County; and at this time, all the prin|cipal Gentry of that County had been &s;eiz'd upon, and were now Pri|&s;oners there. Thither the King came with his Army even a&s;&s;oon as they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The K$$$ mar$he$ to</HI> Worce&s;ter</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> had heard that he was in <HI>England:</HI> whereupon the Committee, and all tho&s;e who were imploy'd by the Parliament, fled in all the confu&s;ion imaginable, leaving their Pri&s;oners behind them, le&s;t they them&s;elves &s;hould become Pri&s;oners to them; and the City open'd their Gates, and receiv'd the King, with all the demon&s;tration of Affection and Duty that could be expre&s;&s;ed; and made &s;uch provi&s;ion for the Army, that it wanted nothing it could de&s;ire; the Mayor taking care for the pre|&s;ent provi&s;ion of Shooes and Stockings, the want whereof, in &s;o long a march, was very apparent and grievous. The principal Per&s;ons of the Country found them&s;elves at liberty; and They, and the Mayor and al|dermen, with all the &s;olemnity they could prepare, attended the Herald, <MILESTONE N="30"> who proclaim'd the King, as he had done, in more ha&s;t, and with le&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">Where he proclaim'd</NOTE> formality, in all tho&s;e con&s;iderable Towns through which his Maje&s;ty had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Army lik'd their Quarters here &s;o well, that neither Officer, nor Soldier was in any degree willing to quit them, till they &s;hould be throughly refre&s;h'd: and it could not be deny'd that the fatigue had been even in&s;upportable; never had &s;o many hundred Miles been march'd in &s;o few days, and with &s;o little re&s;t; nor did it in truth appear rea&s;on|able to any that they &s;hould remove from thence, &s;ince it was not po&s;|&s;ible that they &s;hould be able to reach <HI>London,</HI> though it had been bet|ter <MILESTONE N="40"> prepar'd for the King's reception than it appear'd to be, before <HI>Crom|well</HI> would be there: who, having with great ha&s;t continu'd his march in a direct Line, was now as near to it as the King's Army was, and &s;tood only at a gaze to be inform'd what his Maje&s;ty meant to do. <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter</HI> was a very good Po&s;t, &s;eated allmo&s;t in the middle of the King|dom, and in as fruitful a Country as any part of it; a good City, &s;erv'd by the noble River of <HI>Severn</HI> from all the adjacent Counties; <HI>Wales</HI> be|hind it, from whence Levies might be made of great Numbers of &s;tout Men: it was a place where the King's friends might repair, if they had <MILESTONE N="50"> the Affections they pretended to have; and it was a place where he might defend him&s;elf, if the Enemy would attack him, with many advantages, and could not be compell'd to engage his Army in a Battle, till <HI>Crom|well</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="3300">
had gotten Men enough to encompa&s;s him on all &s;ides: and then the King might choo&s;e on which &s;ide to fight, &s;ince the Enemy mu&s;t be on both &s;ides the River, and could not come &s;uddainly to relieve each other, and the &s;traitning the King to this degree would require much time; in which there might be an opportunity for &s;everal In&s;urrections in the Kingdom, if they were &s;o weary of the pre&s;ent Tyranny, and &s;o &s;ollicitous to be re&s;tor'd to the King's Government, as they were con|ceiv'd to be: for no body could ever hope for a more &s;ecure &s;ea&s;on to manife&s;t their Loyalty, than when the King was in the heart of the King|dom, with a form'd Army of about fifteen thou&s;and Men, Hor&s;e, and <MILESTONE N="10"> Foot (for &s;o they might be accounted to be) with which he might re|lieve tho&s;e who were in danger to be oppre&s;&s;ed by a more powerful party. The&s;e con&s;iderations produced the re&s;olution to provide, in the be&s;t manner, to expect <HI>Cromwell</HI> there; and a hope that he might be delay'd by other diver&s;ions: and there was like to be time enough to ca&s;t up &s;uch Works upon the Hill before the Town, as might keep the Enemy at a di&s;tance, and their own Quarters from being &s;uddainly &s;treighten'd: all which were recommended to General <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> to take care of, and to take &s;uch a perfect View of the Ground, that no advan|tage might be lo&s;t when the time requir'd it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t ill Omen that happen'd, was the News of the defeat of the <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Earl of</HI> Derby.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> and the total de&s;truction of tho&s;e gallant Per&s;ons who accompanied him. The Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> within two or three days after he had left the King, with a Body of near two hundred Hor&s;e, all gal|lant Men, imploy'd his Servants, and Tenants, to give the Country no|tice of his &s;taying behind the King, to head and command tho&s;e Per|&s;ons who &s;hould repair to his &s;ervice; which the quick march his Ma|je&s;ty made through the Country would not permit them to do. In ex|pectation of a good appearance of the People, he went to a little Market Town, call'd <HI>Wigan,</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> where he &s;tay'd that Night; when <MILESTONE N="30"> in the morning a Regiment or two of the Militia of the neighbour Counties, and &s;ome other Troops of the Army, commanded by a Man of courage, whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;ent to follow in the track of the King's march, to gather up the Straglers, and &s;uch as were not able to keep pace with the Army, having receiv'd &s;ome Adverti&s;ement that a Troop of the King's Hor&s;e were behind the Army in that Town, fell very early into it, before the Per&s;ons in the Town were out of their beds, having a&s;&s;urance, upon all the enquiry they could make, that there was no Ene|my near them. Nor indeed was there any &s;u&s;picion of tho&s;e Forces, which con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;everal Troops of the &s;everal Counties with others <MILESTONE N="40"> of the Army, and pa&s;&s;ed that way by Accident. As many as could get to their Hor&s;es, pre&s;ently mounted; they who could not, put them|&s;elves together on foot, and all endeavour'd to keep the Enemy from en|tring into the Town; and the few who were got on Hor&s;eback, charged them with great courage. But the Number of the Enemy was too great, and the Town too open, to put a &s;top to them in any one place, when they could enter at &s;o many, and encompa&s;s tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them. The Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> after his Hor&s;e had been kill'd under him, made a &s;hift to mount again; and &s;o, with a &s;mall Party of Hor&s;e, through many difficulties and dangers, e&s;caped wounded to the King to <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>

tho&s;e who a&s;&s;aulted him, was killed upon the place; and &s;o was S^r <HI>Tho|mas Tilde&s;ley,</HI> and many other gallant Gentlemen, very few e&s;caping to carry News of the defeat. S^r <HI>William Throgmorton,</HI> who had been formerly Major General of the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI>'s Army, and was left to command in the &s;ame function, receiv'd &s;o many wounds, that he was looked upon as dead, and not fit to be carried away with the Pri|&s;oners; and &s;o fell into &s;uch charitable and generous hands in the Town, that, being believ'd to be dead, he was afterwards &s;o well recover'd, though with great maimes and lo&s;s of blood, that he at la&s;t got him|&s;elf tran&s;ported into <HI>Holland;</HI> where he was, at fir&s;t appearance, taken <MILESTONE N="10"> for a Gho&s;t, all Men believing him to have been buried long before.

<P>THE Lord <HI>Withrington</HI> was one of the mo&s;t goodly Per&s;ons of that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Wi|thrington<HI>'s Character.</HI></NOTE> Age, being near the head higher than mo&s;t tall Men, and a Gentleman of the be&s;t and mo&s;t ancient extraction of the County of <HI>Northumber|land,</HI> and of a very fair Fortune, and one of the four which the la&s;t King made choice of to be about the Per&s;on of his Son the Prince as <MILESTONE N="20"> Gentleman of his Privy Chamber, when he fir&s;t &s;ettled his Family. His affection to the King was allways remarkable; and &s;erving in the Hou&s;e of Commons as Knight of the Shire for the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> he quickly got the reputation of being among&s;t the mo&s;t Malignant.

He was very nearly allied to the Marquis; and by his Te&s;timony that he had perform'd many &s;ignal Services, he was, about the middle of the War, made a Peer of the Kingdom. He was a Man of great courage, but of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, by which he incurr'd the <MILESTONE N="30"> ill Will of many, who imputed it to an in&s;olence of Nature, which no Man was farther from; no Man of a Nature more civil, and candid towards all, in bu&s;ine&s;s, or conver&s;ation. But having &s;ate long in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and ob&s;erv'd the di&s;ingenuity of the proceedings there, and the gro&s;s cheats, by which they deceiv'd and con&s;en'd the People, he had contracted &s;o hearty an indignation again&s;t them, and all who were con&s;en'd by them, and again&s;t all who had not his Zeal to oppo&s;e and de&s;troy them, that he often &s;aid things to &s;low and flegma|tick Men, which offended them, and, it may be, injured them; which <MILESTONE N="40"> his good Nature often obliged him to acknowledge, and ask pardon of tho&s;e who would not que&s;tion him for it. He tran&s;ported him&s;elf into the parts beyond the Sea at the &s;ame time with the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> to accompany him, and remain'd &s;till with him till the King went into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and then waited upon his Maje&s;ty, and endured the &s;ame Affronts which others did, during the time of his Re&s;idence there. And, it may be, the ob&s;ervation of their behaviour, the know|ledge of their Principles, and the di&s;dain of their treatment, produced that aver&s;ion from their conver&s;ation, that prevailed upon his impa|tience to part too &s;oon from their Company, in hope that the Earl of <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Derby,</HI> under whom he was very willing to &s;erve, and he him&s;elf, might quickly draw together &s;uch a Body of the Royal Party, as might give &s;ome check to the unbounded imaginations of that Nation. It was

reported by the Enemy, that, in re&s;pect of his brave Per&s;on and beha|viour, they did offer him Quarter; which he refu&s;ed; and that they were thereby compelled, in their own defence, to kill him; which is probable enough; for he knew well the Animo&s;ity the Parliament had again&s;t him, and it cannot be doubted but that, if he had fallen into their hands, they would not have u&s;ed him better than they did the Earl of <HI>Derby;</HI> who had not more Enemies.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Thomas Tilde&s;ly</HI> was a Gentleman of a good Family, and a good <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And S^r</HI> Tho|mas Tilde&s;ly<HI>'s</HI></NOTE> Fortune; who had rai&s;ed Men at his own Charge at the beginning of the War, and had &s;erv'd in the Command of them till the very end of it, with great courage; and refu&s;ing to make any compo&s;ition after the <MILESTONE N="10"> Murther of the King, he found means to tran&s;port him&s;elf into <HI>Ireland</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> with whom he &s;tayed, till he was, with the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, to &s;atisfy the barbarous jea|lou&s;y of the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> and then got over into <HI>Scotland</HI> a little before the King marched from thence, and was de&s;ired by the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> to remain with him. The Names of the other Per&s;ons of Quality who were killed in that Encounter, and tho&s;e who were taken Pri&s;oners, and af|terwards put to death, ought to be di&s;cover'd, and mention'd honoura|bly, by any who &s;hall propo&s;e to him&s;elf to communicate particularly <MILESTONE N="20"> tho&s;e Tran&s;actions to the view of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>WHEN the News of this Defeat came to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> as it did even allmo&s;t a&s;&s;oon as the King came thither, it exceedingly afflicted his Ma|je&s;ty, and abated much of the hope he had of a general Ri&s;ing of the People on his behalf. His Army was very little increa&s;ed by the acce&s;s of any <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and though he had pa&s;&s;ed near the habitation of many Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality, who&s;e Affections and Loyalty had been eminent, not a Man of them repaired to him. The &s;en&s;e of their former Sufferings remain'd, and the &s;mart was not over; nor did his &s;tay in <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> for &s;o many days add any re&s;ort to his Court. The <MILESTONE N="30"> Gentlemen of the Country whom his coming thither had redeem'd from impri&s;onment, remain'd &s;till with him, and were u&s;eful to him; they who were in their Hou&s;es in the Country, though as well affected, re|main'd there, and came not to him; and though Letters from <HI>London</HI> had given him cau&s;e to believe that many prepared to come to him, which for &s;ome days they might ea&s;ily have done, none appear'd, except only &s;ome few Gentlemen, and &s;ome common Men who had formerly &s;erv'd the la&s;t King, and repaired again to <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were &s;ome other Accidents and Ob&s;ervations which admi|ni&s;ter'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tran&s;actions of the King at</HI> Worce&s;ter.</NOTE> matter of Mortification to the King. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> had a mind very re&s;tle&s;s, and thought he had not credit enough with the King, if it were not made manife&s;t that he had more than any Body el&s;e: <Q>and therefore, a&s;&s;oon as the King had enter'd <HI>England,</HI> though he had rea&s;on to believe that his Maje&s;ty had not been abundantly &s;ati&s;|fied with his behaviour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he came to the King, and told him, &startq;the bu&s;ine&s;s was now to reduce <HI>England</HI> to his obedience; and there|fore he ought to do all things gracious, and popular in the eyes of the Nation; and nothing could be le&s;s &s;o, than that the Army &s;hould be under the Command of a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> General: that <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> was only Lieutenant General; and it had been unrea&s;onable, whil&s;t he remain'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to have put any other to have commanded over him; <MILESTONE N="50"> but that it would be as unrea&s;onable, now they were in <HI>England,</HI> and had hope to increa&s;e the Army by the acce&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> upon
<PB N="317" REF="3330">
whom his principal dependence mu&s;t be, to expect that they would be willing to &s;erve under <HI>Le&s;ley:</HI> that it would not con&s;i&s;t with the honour of any Peer of <HI>England</HI> to receive His Orders; and, he believ'd, that very few of that Rank would repair to his Maje&s;ty, till they were&endq; &s;ecure from that apprehen&s;ion;</Q> and u&s;ed much more di&s;cour&s;e to that purpo&s;e. The King was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed with it, that he could not imagine what he meant, and what the end of it would be; <Q>and asked him, &startq;who it was that he thought fit his Maje&s;ty &s;hould give that Com|mand to? when, to his a&s;toni&s;hment, the Duke told him, he hoped&endq; his Maje&s;ty would confer it upon him&s;elf.</Q> At which the King was &s;o <MILESTONE N="10"> amazed, that he found an occa&s;ion to break off the di&s;cour&s;e, by calling upon &s;ome Body who was near, to come to him; and, by asking many que&s;tions, declined the former Argument. The Duke would not be &s;o put off; but, the next day, in the march, renew'd his importunity; <Q>and told the King, &startq;that, he was confident, what he had propo&s;ed to him, was &s;o evidently for his Service, that <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> him&s;elf would&endq; willingly con&s;ent to it.</Q> <Q>The King, angry at his pro&s;ecuting it in that manner, told him, &startq;he could hardly believe that he was in earne&s;t, or&endq; that he could in truth believe that he could be fit for &s;uch a Charge;</Q> <Q>which the Duke &s;eem'd to wonder at, and asked, &startq;wherein his unfitne&s;s&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> lay?</Q> <Q>to which the King replied, &startq;&endq;that he was too young:</Q> <Q>and he as readily alledged, &startq;that <HI>Harry</HI> the fourth of <HI>France</HI> commanded an Ar|my,&endq; and won a Battle, when he was younger than He:</Q> <Q>&s;o that, in the end, the King was compelled to tell him, &startq;that he would have no&endq; Generali&s;&s;imo but Him&s;elf:</Q> upon which the Duke was &s;o di&s;contented, that he came no more to the Council, &s;carce &s;poke to the King, neglected every Body el&s;e and him&s;elf, in&s;omuch as for many days he &s;carce put on clean Linen, nor conver&s;ed with any Body; nor did he recover this ill humour whil&s;t the Army &s;tayed at <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was another wor&s;e Accident fell out &s;oon after the King's <MILESTONE N="30"> coming thither: Major General <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> who thought him&s;elf now in his own Territory, and that all between <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> would be quickly his own Conque&s;t, knowing every &s;tep both by Land and the River, went out with a Party to &s;ecure a Pa&s;s, which the Enemy might make over the River; which he did very well; but would then make a farther in road into the Country, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a Hou&s;e which was of &s;mall importance, and in which there were Men to defend it; where he receiv'd a very dangerous Wound, that tore his Arme, and Hand, in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>General</HI> Ma$|&s;ey <HI>wounded in an attempt</HI></NOTE> &s;uch manner that he was in great torment, and could not &s;tir out of his bed, in a time when his Activity and Indu&s;try was mo&s;t wanted. By this means, the Pa&s;s he had &s;ecured, was either totally neglected, or <MILESTONE N="40"> not enough taken care for.</P>
<P>THERE was no good under&s;tanding between the Officers of the Ar|my: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill di&s;po&s;i|tion of the King's Of|ficers&punc;</NOTE> <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> appear'd di&s;pirited, and confounded; gave, and re|voked his Orders, and &s;ometimes contradicted them. He did not love <HI>Middleton,</HI> and was very jealous that all the Officers lov'd him too well; who was indeed an excellent Officer, and kept up the Spirits of the re&s;t, who had no e&s;teem of <HI>Le&s;ley.</HI> In this very unhappy di&s;temper was the Court, and the Army, in a Sea&s;on when they were ready to be &s;wallow'd by the power, and multitude of the Enemy, and when nothing could pre&s;erve them, but the mo&s;t &s;incere Unity in their prayers to <MILESTONE N="50"> God, and a joynt concurrence in their coun&s;els and endeavours; in all which they were mi&s;erably divided.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="3340">
THE King had been &s;everal days in <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> when <HI>Cromwell</HI> was known to be within le&s;s than half a day's march, with an addition of very many Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot to tho&s;e which he had brought with him from <HI>Scotland;</HI> and many other Regiments were drawing towards him of the Militia of the &s;everal Counties, under the command of the principal Gentlemen of their party in the Countries: &s;o that he was already very much &s;uperior, if not double in Number to the Army the King had with him. However, if tho&s;e Rules had been ob&s;erv'd, tho&s;e Works ca&s;t up, and that order in quartering their Men, as were re&s;olv'd upon when the King came thither, there mu&s;t have been a good defence made, and the Advantages of the ground, the River, and the <MILESTONE N="10"> City, would have pre&s;erv'd them from being pre&s;ently overrun. But, alas! the Army was in amazement and confu&s;ion. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> without troubling him&s;elf with the formality of a Siege, marched directly on as to a Prey, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Hill and all other places of Advantage, with very little oppo&s;ition. It was upon the third of <HI>September,</HI> when <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's de|feat at</HI> Wor|ce&s;ter 3^d <HI>of September.</HI></NOTE> the King having been upon his Hor&s;e mo&s;t part of the Night, and having taken a full view of the Enemy, and every body being upon the Po&s;t they were appointed, and the Enemy making &s;uch a &s;tand, that it was concluded he meant to make no Attempt then, and if he &s;hould, he might be repelled with ea&s;e; his Maje&s;ty, a little before noon, retired <MILESTONE N="20"> to his Lodging to eat, and refre&s;h him&s;elf: <Q>where he had not been near an hour, when the Alarm came, &startq;&endq;that both Armies were engaged;</Q> and though his Maje&s;ty's own Hor&s;e was ready at the door, and he pre&s;ently mounted, before or a&s;&s;oon as he came out of the City, he met the whole Body of his Hor&s;e running in &s;o great di&s;order, that he could not &s;top them, though he u&s;ed all the means he could, and called to many Of|ficers by their Names; and hardly pre&s;erv'd him&s;elf, by letting them pa&s;s by, from being overthrown, and overrun by them.</P>
<P>CROMWELL had u&s;ed none of the delay, nor circum&s;pection which was imagin'd; but directed the Troops to fall on in all places at once; <MILESTONE N="30"> and had cau&s;ed a &s;trong Party to go over the River at the Pa&s;s, which <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> had formerly &s;ecured, at a good di&s;tance from the Town. And that being not at all guarded, they were never known to be on that &s;ide the River, till they were even ready to charge the King's Troops. On that part where <HI>Middleton</HI> was, and with whom Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> charged, there was a very brave re&s;i&s;tance; and they charged the Ene|my &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they beat the Body that charged them back, but they were quickly overpower'd; and many Gentlemen being kill'd, and <HI>Middleton</HI> hurt, and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Leg broke with a Shot, the re&s;t were forced to retire and &s;hift for them&s;elves. In no other part was <MILESTONE N="40"> there re&s;i&s;tance made; but &s;uch a general con&s;ternation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole Army, that the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e fled, and all the Foot threw down their Armes before they were charged. When the King came back into the Town, he found a good Body of Hor&s;e, which had been per|&s;waded to make a &s;tand, though much the major part pa&s;&s;ed through upon the Spur. <Q>The King de&s;ired tho&s;e who &s;tayed, &startq;that they would follow him, that they might look upon the Enemy, who, he believ'd,&endq; did not pur&s;ue them.</Q> But when his Maje&s;ty had gone a little way, he found mo&s;t of the Hor&s;e were gone the other way, and that he had none but a few Servants of his own about him. Then he &s;ent to have <MILESTONE N="50"> the Gates of the Town &s;hut, that none might get in one way, nor out the other: but all was confu&s;ion; there were few to command, and
<PB N="319" REF="3350">
none to obey: &s;o that the King &s;tay'd, till very many of the Enemy's Hor&s;e were enter'd the Town, and then he was per&s;waded to withdraw him&s;elf.</P>
<P>DUKE <HI>Hamilton</HI> fell into the Enemy's hands; and, the next day, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil|ton <HI>died of his wounds.</HI></NOTE> died of his Wounds; and thereby prevented the being made a Spectacle, as his Brother had been; which the pride and animo&s;ity of his Enemies would no doubt have cau&s;ed to be, having the &s;ame pretence for it by his being a Peer of <HI>England,</HI> as the other was. He was in all re&s;pects to <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character</NOTE> be much preferr'd before the other, a much wi&s;er, though, it may be, a le&s;s cunning Man: for he did not affect di&s;&s;imulation, which was the <MILESTONE N="10"> other's Ma&s;ter-piece. He had unque&s;tionable courage: he was in truth a very accompli&s;h'd Per&s;on, of an excellent Judgement, and clear and ready Expre&s;&s;ions: and though he had been driven into &s;ome unwar|rantable Actions, he made it very evident he had not been led by any Inclinations of his own, and pa&s;&s;ionately and heartily run to all oppor|tunities of redeeming it: <Q>and, in the very Article of his death, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed a marvellous chearfulne&s;s, &startq;that he had the honour to lo&s;e his life in the King's Service, and thereby to wipe out the memory of&endq; his former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions;</Q> which he allways profe&s;&s;ed were odious to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AS the Victory co&s;t the Enemy little blood, &s;o after it there was not <MILESTONE N="20"> much cruelty u&s;ed to the Pri&s;oners who were taken upon the &s;pot. But very many of tho&s;e who run away, were every day knock'd in the head by the Country People, and u&s;ed with barbarity. Towards the King's menial Servants, whereof mo&s;t were taken, there was nothing of &s;everity; but within few days they were all di&s;charged, and &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King could not get a Body of Hor&s;e to fight, he could <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Re|treat, and con|cealment.</NOTE> have too many to fly with him; and he had not been many hours from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> when he found about him near, if not above four thou&s;and of his Hor&s;e. There was <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> with all his own Equipage, as <MILESTONE N="30"> if he had not fled upon the &s;uddain; &s;o that good order, and regularity, and obedience, might yet have made a retreat even into <HI>Scotland</HI> it &s;elf. But there was palene&s;s in every Man's looks, and jealou&s;y, and confu|&s;ion, in their faces; and &s;carce any thing could wor&s;e befal the King, than a return into <HI>Scotland;</HI> which yet he could not rea&s;onably pro|mi&s;e to him&s;elf in that company. But when the night cover'd them, he found means to withdraw him&s;elf with one or two of his own Ser|vants; whom he likewi&s;e di&s;charged, when it begun to be light; and after he had made them cut off his hair, he betook him&s;elf alone into an <MILESTONE N="40"> adjacent Wood, and relied only upon Him for his pre&s;ervation who alone could, and did Miraculou&s;ly deliver him.</P>
<P>WHEN it was morning, and the Troops, which had march'd all Night, and who knew that when it begun to be dark the King was with them, found now that he was not there, they cared le&s;s for each others com|pany; and mo&s;t of them who were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;eparated them&s;elves, and went into other Roads; and wherever twenty Hor&s;e appear'd of the Country, which was now awake, and upon their Guard to &s;top and ar|re&s;t the runaways, the whole Body of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e would fly, and run &s;everal ways; and twenty of them would give them&s;elves Pri&s;oners to two Country fellows: however, <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> reach'd <HI>York&s;hire</HI> with <MILESTONE N="50"> above fifteen hundred Hor&s;e in a Body. But the jealou&s;ies increas'd every day; and tho&s;e of his own Country were &s;o un&s;atisfied with his whole

conduct and behaviour, that they did, that is many of them, believe that he was corrupted by <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and the re&s;t, who did not think &s;o, believ'd him not to under&s;tand his profe&s;&s;ion, in which he had been bred from his Cradle. When he was in his flight, con&s;idering one mor|ning with the principal Per&s;ons, which way they &s;hould take, &s;ome propo&s;ed this, and others that way; <Q>S^r <HI>William Armorer</HI> ask'd him, &startq;which way he thought be&s;t? which when he had named, the other &s;aid he would then go the other; for, he &s;wore, he had betray'd the King&endq; and the Army all the time;</Q> and &s;o left him.</P>
<P>WELL nigh all of them in this long flight were taken, and among&s;t <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">David Le&s;ley <HI>and the re&s;t taken.</HI></NOTE> them the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and many of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nobility, and the Earls of <HI>Cleveland</HI> and <HI>Derby,</HI> and divers other Men of Quality of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. And it is hard to be believ'd how very few of that nu|merous Body of Hor&s;e (for there can be no imagination that any of the Foot e&s;cap'd) return'd into <HI>Scotland.</HI> Upon all the enquiry that was made, when mo&s;t of the fal&s;e and treacherous Actions which had been committed were di&s;cover'd, there appear'd no cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> had been unfaithful in his Charge: though he never recover'd any reputation with tho&s;e of his own Country who wedded the King's In|tere&s;t. And it was &s;ome vindication to him, that, from the time of his im|pri&s;onment, <MILESTONE N="20"> he never receiv'd any favour from the Parliament, whom he had &s;erv'd &s;o long; nor from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> in who&s;e Company he had &s;erv'd; but underwent all the Severities, and long impri&s;onment, the re&s;t of his Country-men &s;uffer'd. The King did not believe him fal&s;e; and did all|ways think him an excellent Officer of Hor&s;e, to di&s;tribute and execute Orders, but in no degree capable of commanding in chief. And without doubt he was &s;o amaz'd in that fatal day, that he perform'd not the Office of a General, or of any competent Officer.</P>
<P>THEY who fled out of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and were not kill'd, but made Pri|&s;oners, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Foot driven Pri&s;oners to</HI> London, <HI>and &s;old to the Plantations.</HI></NOTE> and all the Foot, and others who were taken in the Town, ex|cept &s;ome few Officers and Per&s;ons of Quality, were driven like Cattle <MILESTONE N="30"> with a Guard to <HI>London,</HI> and there treated with great rigour; and many peri&s;h'd for want of food; and being inclo&s;ed in little room, till they were &s;old to the Plantations for Slaves, they died of all di&s;ea&s;es. <HI>Crom|well</HI> return'd in Triumph; was receiv'd with univer&s;al joy and accla|mation, as if he had de&s;troy'd the Enemy of the Nation, and for ever &s;ecured the Liberty, and Happine&s;s of the People: a price was &s;et upon the King's head, who&s;e e&s;cape was thought to be impo&s;&s;ible; and order taken for the Trial of the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> and &s;uch other notorious Pri|&s;oners as they had voted to de&s;truction. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> was a Man of unque&s;tionable Loyalty to the late <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Derby <HI>his Character and Execution.</HI></NOTE> King, and gave clear te&s;timony of it before he receiv'd any obligations from the Court, and when he thought him&s;elf di&s;obliged by it. This King, in his fir&s;t year, &s;ent him the Garter; which, in many re&s;pects, he had expected from the la&s;t. And the &s;en&s;e of that Honour made him &s;o readily comply with the King's Command in attending him, when he had no confidence in the Undertaking, nor any inclination to the <HI>Scots;</HI> who, he thought, had too much guilt upon them, in having de|pre&s;&s;ed the Crown, to be made In&s;truments of repairing and re&s;toring it. He was a Man of great honour and clear courage; and all his de|fects, and misfortunes, proceeded from his having liv'd &s;o little time <MILESTONE N="50"> among his equals, that he knew not how to treat his Inferiors; which was the &s;ource of all the ill that befell him, having thereby drawn &s;uch

<P>THEY of the King's friends in <HI>Flanders, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="20"> had not been permitted to attend upon his Maje&s;ty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> were much exalted with the News of his being enter'd <HI>England</HI> with a power|ful Army, and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> which made all Men pre|pare to make ha&s;t thither. <Q>But they were confounded with the News of that fatal day, and more confounded with the various reports of the Per&s;on of the King, &startq;of his being found among&s;t the dead; of his being&endq; Pri&s;oner;</Q> and all tho&s;e imaginations which naturally attend upon &s;uch unpro&s;perous events. Many who had made e&s;capes, arriv'd every day in <HI>France, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> but knew no more what was be|come of the King, than They did who had not been in <HI>England.</HI> The only comfort that any of them brought, was, that he was among&s;t tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> that fled, and &s;ome of them had &s;een him that evening after the Battle, many miles out of <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e un&s;teady degrees of hope and fear tormented them very long; &s;ometimes they heard he was at the <HI>Hague</HI> with his Si&s;ter, which was occa&s;ion'd by the arrival of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in <HI>Holland;</HI> and it was thought good Policy to publi&s;h that the King him&s;elf was landed, that the Search after him in <HI>England</HI> might be di&s;continued. But it was quickly known that he was not there, nor in any place on that &s;ide the Sea. And this anxiety of mind di&s;|quieted the hearts of all hone&s;t Men during the whole Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> and part of <HI>November;</HI> in which Month his <MILESTONE N="40"> Maje&s;ty was known to be at <HI>Roan;</HI> where he made him&s;elf known, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King came to</HI> Roa$ <HI>in</HI> November</NOTE> &s;tay'd &s;ome days to provide Cloaths; and from thence gave notice to the Queen of his Arrival.</P>
<P>IT is great pity that there was never a Journal made of that mira|culous <NOTE PLACE="marg">The particu|lars of the King's E&s;cape, at the A$th$r $ad them $Word$ the King him|&s;elf.</NOTE> deliverance, in which there might be &s;een &s;o many vi&s;ible im|pre&s;&s;ions of the immediate hand of God. When the darkne&s;s of the night was over, after the King had ca&s;t him&s;elf into that Wood, he di&s;cern'd another Man, who had gotten upon an Oak in the &s;ame Wood, near the place where the King had re&s;ted him&s;elf, and had &s;lept &s;oundly. <MILESTONE N="50"> The Man upon the Tree had fir&s;t &s;een the King, and knew him, and came down to him, and was known to the King, being a Gentleman of the neighbour County of <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> who had &s;erv'd his late Maje&s;ty
<PB N="322" REF="3380">
during the War, and had now been one of the few who re&s;orted to the King after his coming to <HI>Worcester.</HI> His name was <HI>Carele&s;s,</HI> who had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King meets</HI> Captain Carele&s;s <HI>in a Wood, who per|&s;wades him to get up into an Oak</HI></NOTE> had a Command of Foot, about the degree of a Captain, under the Lord <HI>Loughborough.</HI> He per&s;waded the King, &s;ince it could not be &s;afe for him to go out of the Wood, and that, a&s;&s;oon as it &s;hould be fully light, the Wood it &s;elf would probably be vi&s;ited by tho&s;e of the Country, who would be &s;earching to find tho&s;e whom they might make Pri&s;oners, that he would get up into that Tree, where He had been; where the Boughs were &s;o thick with leaves, that a Man would not be di&s;cover'd there without a narrower Enquiry than People u&s;ually make in places which <MILESTONE N="10"> they do not &s;u&s;pect. The King thought it good Coun&s;el; and, with the other's help, climb'd into the Tree; and then help'd his Companion to a&s;cend after him; where they &s;ate all that day, and &s;ecurely &s;aw Many who came purpo&s;ely into the Wood to look after them, and heard all their di&s;cour&s;e, how they would u&s;e the King him&s;elf if they could take him. This Wood was either in, or upon the Borders of <HI>Stafford&s;hire;</HI> and though there was a high-way near one &s;ide of it, where the King had enter'd into it, yet it was large, and all other &s;ides of it open'd among&s;t Inclo&s;ures, and <HI>Carele&s;s</HI> was not unacquainted with the Neigh|bour Villages, and it was part of the King's good fortune, that this Gen|tleman <MILESTONE N="20"> by being a Roman Catholick, was acquainted with tho&s;e of that profe&s;&s;ion of all degrees, who had the be&s;t opportunities of concealing him: for it mu&s;t never be denied, that &s;ome of that Religion had a very great &s;hare in his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THE day being &s;pent in the Tree, it was not in the King's power to forget that he had liv'd two days with eating very little, and two Nights with as little &s;leep; &s;o that, when the night came, he was willing to make &s;ome provi&s;ion for both: and he re&s;olv'd, with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Companion, to leave his ble&s;&s;ed Tree; and, when the Night was dark, they walk'd through the Wood into tho&s;e Inclo&s;ures <MILESTONE N="30"> which were farthe&s;t from any high-way, and making a &s;hift to get over Hedges and Ditches, after walking at lea&s;t eight or nine Miles, which were the more grievous to the King by the weight of his Boots (for he could not put them off, when he cut off his hair, for want of Shooes) before morning they came to a poor Cottage, the Owner whereof being <NOTE PLACE="marg">Then the came to a Cottage nine miles off, $here $e $ay $$ a Barn.</NOTE> a Roman Catholick was known to <HI>Carele&s;s.</HI> He was call'd up, and a&s;&s;oon as he knew one of them, he ea&s;ily concluded in what condition they both were; and pre&s;ently carried them into a little Barn, full of hay; which was a better lodging than he had for him&s;elf. But when they were there, and had conferr'd with their Ho&s;t of the news and temper of <MILESTONE N="40"> the Country, it was agreed, that the danger would be the greater if they &s;tay'd together; and therefore that <HI>Carele&s;s</HI> &s;hould pre&s;ently be gone; and &s;hould, within two days, &s;end an hone&s;t Man to the King, to guide him to &s;ome other place of &s;ecurity; and in the mean time his Maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;tay upon the Hay-mow. The poor Man had nothing for him to eat, but promi&s;ed him good Butter-milk; and &s;o he was once more left alone, his Companion, how weary &s;oever, departing from him before day, the poor Man of the Hou&s;e knowing no more, than that he was a friend of the Captain's, and one of tho&s;e who had e&s;caped from <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter.</HI> The King &s;lept very well in his lodging, till the time that his <MILESTONE N="50"> Ho&s;t brought him a piece of Bread, and a great Pot of Butter-milk, which he thought the be&s;t food he ever had eaten. The poor Man &s;poke very intelligently to him of the Country, and of the People who were well,
<PB N="323" REF="3390">
or ill affected to the King, and of the great fear, and terror, that po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the hearts of tho&s;e who were be&s;t affected. <Q>He told him, &startq;that he him|&s;elf liv'd by his daily Labour, and that what he had brought him was the &s;are he and his Wife had; and that he feared, if he &s;hould endea|vour to procure better, it might draw &s;u&s;picion upon him, and Peo|ple might be apt to think he had &s;ome body with him that was not of his own Family. However, if he would have him get &s;ome Meat, he would do it; but if he could bear this hard diet, he &s;hould have enough&endq; of the Milk, and &s;ome of the Butter that was made with it.</Q> The King was &s;atisfied with his rea&s;on, and would not run the hazard for a change <MILESTONE N="10"> of diet; <Q>de&s;ired only the Man, &startq;that he might have his Company as&endq; often, and as much as he could give it him;</Q> there being the &s;ame rea&s;on again&s;t the poor Man's di&s;continuing his labour, as the alteration of his fare.</P>
<P>AFTER he had re&s;ted upon this Hay-mow, and fed upon this diet two days and two nights, in the evening before the third night, an|other fellow, a little above the condition of his Ho&s;t, came to the Hou&s;e, &s;ent from <HI>Carele&s;s,</HI> to conduct the King to another Hou&s;e, more out <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence he is conducted to another Hou&s;e</HI> 12 <HI>miles off:</HI></NOTE> of any Road near which any part of the Army was like to march. It was above twelve Miles that he was to go, and was to u&s;e the &s;ame cau|tion he had done the fir&s;t night, not to go in any common Road; which <MILESTONE N="20"> his Guide knew well how to avoid. Here he new dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, chang|ing Cloaths with his Landlord; he had a great mind to have kept his own Shirt, but he con&s;ider'd, that Men are not &s;ooner di&s;cover'd by any mark in di&s;gui&s;es, than by having fine Linen in ill Cloaths; and &s;o he parted with his Shirt too, and took the &s;ame his poor Ho&s;t had then on. Though he had fore&s;een that he mu&s;t leave his Boots, and his Land|lord had taken the be&s;t care he could to provide an old pair of Shooes, yet they were not ea&s;y to him when he fir&s;t put them on, and, in a &s;hort time after, grew very grievous to him. In this Equipage he &s;et out from his fir&s;t Lodging in the beginning of the night, under the conduct <MILESTONE N="30"> of this Guide; who guided him the neare&s;t way, cro&s;&s;ing over Hedges and Ditches, that they might be in lea&s;t danger of meeting pa&s;&s;engers. This was &s;o grievous a march, and he was &s;o tired, that he was even ready to de&s;pair, and to prefer being taken and &s;uffer'd to re&s;t, before purcha&s;ing his &s;afety at that price. His Shooes had, after a few miles, hurt him &s;o much, that he had thrown them away, and walked the re&s;t of the way in his ill Stockings, which were quickly worne out; and his Feet, with the Thorns in getting over Hedges, and with the Stones in other places, were &s;o hurt and wounded, that he many times ca&s;t him&s;elf upon the ground, with a de&s;perate and ob&s;tinate re&s;olution to <MILESTONE N="40"> re&s;t there till the morning, that he might &s;hift with le&s;s torment, what hazard &s;oever he run. But his &s;tout Guide &s;till prevailed with him to make a new attempt, &s;ometimes promi&s;ing that the way &s;hould be bet|ter, and &s;ometimes a&s;&s;uring him that he had but little farther to go: and in this di&s;tre&s;s and perplexity, before the morning, they arriv'd at the Hou&s;e de&s;ign'd; which though it was better than that which he had left, his lodging was &s;till in the Barn, upon Straw in&s;tead of Hay, a place being made as ea&s;y in it, as the expectation of a Gue&s;t could di&s;po&s;e it. Here he had &s;uch Meat and Porridge as &s;uch People u&s;e to have; with which, but e&s;pecially with the Butter and the Chee&s;e, he thought <MILESTONE N="50"> him&s;elf well fea&s;ted; and took the be&s;t care he could to be &s;upplied with other, little better, Shooes and Stockings: and after his Feet were enough
<PB N="324" REF="3400">
recover'd that he could go, he was conducted from thence to another <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to an|other; and $o to others</NOTE> poor Hou&s;e, within &s;uch a di&s;tance as put him not to much trouble: for having not yet in his thought which way, or by what means to make his e&s;cape, all that was de&s;ign'd was only by &s;hifting from one Hou&s;e to another, to avoid di&s;covery. And being now in that Quarter, which was more inhabited by the Roman Catholicks than mo&s;t other parts in <HI>England,</HI> he was led from one to another of that per&s;wa&s;ion, and con|cealed with great fidelity. But he then ob&s;erv'd that he was never carried to any Gentleman's Hou&s;e, though that Country was full of them, but only to poor Hou&s;es of poor Men, which only yielded him re&s;t with very unplea&s;ant &s;u&s;tenance; whether there was more danger in tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="10"> better Hou&s;es, in regard of the re&s;ort, and the many Servants; or whe|ther the Owners of great E&s;tates, were the Owners likewi&s;e of more fears and apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>WITHIN few days, a very hone&s;t and di&s;creet Per&s;on, one M^r <HI>Hud|le&s;ton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Hudle&s;ton <HI>&s;ent to him by</HI> Carele&s;s; <HI>who brought him to the Lord</HI> Wilmot</NOTE> a Benedictine Monk, who attended the Service of the Roman Catholicks in tho&s;e parts, came to him, &s;ent by <HI>Carele&s;s;</HI> and was a very great a&s;&s;i&s;tance and comfort to him. And when the places to which he carried him, were at too great a di&s;tance to walk, he provided him a Hor&s;e, and more proper Habit than the Rags he wore. <Q>This Man told him, &startq;that the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> lay concealed likewi&s;e in a Friend's <MILESTONE N="20"> Hou&s;e of his; which his Maje&s;ty was very glad of; and wi&s;hed him&endq; to contrive &s;ome means, how they might &s;peak together;</Q> which the other ea&s;ily did; and, within a night or two, brought them into one place. <Q><HI>Wilmot</HI> told the King &startq;that he had, by very good fortune, fallen into the Hou&s;e of an hone&s;t Gentleman, one M^r <HI>Lane,</HI> a Per&s;on of an excellent reputation for his fidelity to the King, but of &s;o univer&s;al and general a good Name, that, though he had a Son, who had been a Colonel in the King's Service, during the late War, and was then upon his way with Men to <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> the very day of the defeat, Men of all Affections in the Country, and of all opinions, paid the old Man <MILESTONE N="30"> a very great re&s;pect: that he had been very civilly treated there, and that the old Gentleman had u&s;ed &s;ome diligence to find out where the King was, that he might get him to his Hou&s;e; where, he was &s;ure,&endq; he could conceal him till he might contrive a full deliverance.</Q> <Q>He told him, &startq;he had withdrawn from that Hou&s;e, in hope that he might, in &s;ome other place, di&s;cover where his Maje&s;ty was, and having now happily found him, advi&s;ed him to repair to that Hou&s;e, which &s;tood&endq; not near any other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King enquired of the Monk of the reputation of this Gentle|man; who told him, &startq;that he had a fair E&s;tate; was exceedingly be|lov'd; <MILESTONE N="40"> and the elde&s;t Ju&s;tice of Peace of that County of <HI>Stafford;</HI> and though he was a very zealous Prote&s;tant, yet he liv'd with &s;o much civility and candour towards the Catholicks, that they would all tru&s;t him, as much as they would do any of their own profe&s;&s;ion; and that he could not think of any place of &s;o good repo&s;e and &s;ecurity for his&endq; Maje&s;ty's repair to.</Q> The King liked the Propo&s;ition, yet thought not &s;it to &s;urpri&s;e the Gentleman; but &s;ent <HI>Wilmot</HI> thither again, to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf that he might be receiv'd there; and was willing that he &s;hould know what Gue&s;t he receiv'd; which hitherto was &s;o much concealed, <MILESTONE N="50"> that none of the Hou&s;es where he had yet been, knew, or &s;eem'd to &s;u&s;|pect more than that he was one of the King's Party that fled from <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter.</HI> The Monk carried him to a Hou&s;e at a rea&s;onable di&s;tance,
<PB N="325" REF="3410">
where he was to expect an Account from the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> who re|turn'd very punctually, with as much a&s;&s;urance of welcome as he could wi&s;h.

Here he lodged, and eat very well; and begun to hope that he was in pre&s;ent &s;afety. <HI>Wilmot</HI> return'd under the care of the Monk, and expected Summons, when any farther motion &s;hould be thought to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IN this Station the King remain'd in quiet and ble&s;&s;ed &s;ecurity many <MILESTONE N="1"> days, receiving every day information of the general con&s;ternation the Kingdom was in, out of the apprehen&s;ion that his Per&s;on might fall into the hands of his Enemies, and of the great diligence they u&s;ed to enquire for him. He &s;aw the Proclamation that was i&s;&s;ued out and printed; in which a thou&s;and pounds were promi&s;ed to any Man who would deliver and di&s;cover the Per&s;on of <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> and the pe|nalty of High Trea&s;on declared again&s;t tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to harbour or conceal him: by which he &s;aw how much he was beholding to all tho&s;e who were faithful to him. It was now time to con&s;ider how he might get near the Sea, from whence he might find &s;ome means to <MILESTONE N="2"> tran&s;port him&s;elf: and he was now near the middle of the Kingdom, &s;aving that it was a little more Northward, where he was utterly un|acquainted with all the Ports, and with that Coa&s;t. In the We&s;t he was be&s;t acquainted, and that Coa&s;t was mo&s;t proper to tran&s;port him into <HI>France;</HI> to which he was inclined. Upon this matter he communicated with tho&s;e of this Family to whom he was known, that is, with the old Gentleman the Father, a very grave and venerable Per&s;on, the Co|lonel his Elde&s;t Son, a very plain Man in his di&s;cour&s;e and behaviour, but of a fearle&s;s Courage, and an integrity &s;uperior to any temptation, and a Daughter of the Hou&s;e, of a very good wit and di&s;cretion, and <MILESTONE N="3"> very fit to bear any part in &s;uch a Tru&s;t. It was a benefit, as well as an inconvenience, in tho&s;e unhappy times, that the Affections of all Men were allmo&s;t as well known as their faces, by the di&s;covery they had made of them&s;elves, in tho&s;e &s;ad Sea&s;ons, in many trials and Per&s;ecu|tions: &s;o that Men knew not only the minds of their next Neighbours, and tho&s;e who inhabited near them, but, upon conference with their Friends, could choo&s;e fit Hou&s;es, at any di&s;tance, to repo&s;e them&s;elves in &s;ecurity, from one end of the Kingdom to another, without tru&s;ting the Ho&s;pitality of a common Inn: and Men were very rarely deceiv'd in their confidence upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, but the Per&s;ons with whom they were at any time, could conduct them to another Hou&s;e of the <MILESTONE N="4"> &s;ame Affection.</P>
<P>M$ LANE had a Niece, or very near Kin&s;woman, who was married to a Gentleman, one M^r <HI>Norton,</HI> a Per&s;on of eight or nine hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> who liv'd within four or five Miles of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which was at lea&s;t four or five days journey from the place where the King then was, but a place mo&s;t to be wi&s;h'd for the King to be in, be|cau&s;e he did not only know all that Country very well, but knew many Per&s;ons al&s;o, to whom, in an extraordinary ca&s;e, he dur&s;t make him|&s;elf known.

wait upon her. A good Hou&s;e was ea&s;ily pitch'd upon for the fir&s;t night's Lodging; where <HI>Wilmot</HI> had notice given him to meet. And in this Equipage the King begun his journey; the Colonel keeping him Com|pany at a di&s;tance, with a Hawk upon his fi&s;t, and two or three Spaniels; which, where there were any Fields at hand, warranted him to ride out of the way, keeping his Company &s;till in his eye, and not &s;eeming to be of it. In this manner they came to their fir&s;t night's Lodging; and they need not now Contrive to come to their journey's end about the clo&s;e of the evening, for it was in the Month of <HI>October</HI> far ad|vanced, that the long journies they made could not be di&s;patch'd &s;ooner. <MILESTONE N="10"> Here the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> found them; and their journies being then ad|ju&s;ted, he was in&s;tructed where he &s;hould be every night: &s;o they were &s;eldom &s;een together in the journey, and rarely lodged in the &s;ame Hou&s;e at night. In this manner the Colonel hawked two or three days, till he had brought them within le&s;s than a day's journey of M^r <HI>Norton</HI>'s Hou&s;e; and then he gave his Hawk to the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> who con|tinued the journey in the &s;ame Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE was great care taken when they came to any Hou&s;e, that the King might be pre&s;ently carried into &s;ome Chamber; <Q>M^r^s <HI>Lane</HI> declaring &startq;that he was a Neighbour's Son, whom his Father had lent <MILESTONE N="20"> her to ride before her, in hope that he would the &s;ooner recover from a Quartan Ague, with which he had been mi&s;erably afflicted, and was&endq; not yet free.</Q> And by this Artifice &s;he cau&s;ed a good bed to be &s;till provided for him, and the be&s;t meat to be &s;ent; which &s;he often carried her &s;elf, to hinder others from doing it. There was no re&s;ting in any place till they came to M^r <HI>Norton</HI>'s, nor any thing extraordinary that happen'd in the way, &s;ave that they met many People every day in the way, who were very well known to the King; and the day that they went to M^r <HI>Norton</HI>'s, they were nece&s;&s;arily to ride quite through the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> a place, and People, the King had been &s;o well ac|quainted <MILESTONE N="30"> with, that he could not but &s;end his eyes abroad to view the great alterations which had been made there, after his departure from thence: and when he rode near the place where the great Fort had &s;tood, he could not forbear putting his Hor&s;e out of the way, and rode with his Mi&s;tre&s;s behind him round about it.</P>
<P>THEY came to M^r <HI>Norton</HI>'s Hou&s;e &s;ooner than u&s;ual, and it being <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They came &s;afe to M^r</HI> Nor|ton<HI>'s through</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> on a Holy-day, they &s;aw many People about a bowling-Green that was before the door, and the fir&s;t Man the King &s;aw was a Chaplain of his own, who was ally'd to the Gentleman of the Hou&s;e, and was &s;itting upon the rails to &s;ee how the Bowlers play'd. <HI>William,</HI> by which name <MILESTONE N="40"> the King went, walk'd with his Hor&s;e into the Stable, until his Mi&s;tre&s;s could provide for his retreat.

<P><Q>D^r GORGES, the King's Chaplain, being a Gentleman of a good fa|mily near that place, and allied to M^r <HI>Norton,</HI> &s;upped with them, and being a Man of a chearful Conver&s;ation, ask'd M^r^s <HI>Lane</HI> many que&s;tions concerning <HI>William,</HI> of whom he &s;aw &s;he was &s;o careful by &s;ending up Meat to him, &startq;how long his Ague had been gone? and whether he had&endq; purged &s;ince it left him? and the like;</Q> to which &s;he gave &s;uch An|&s;wers as occurr'd.

<P>AFTER &s;ome days &s;tay here, and communication between the King and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> by Letters, the King came to know that Colonel <HI>Francis Windham</HI> liv'd within little more than a days Journey of the place where he was; of which he was very glad; for be&s;ides the inclina|tion he had to his elder Brother, who&s;e Wife had been his Nur&s;e, this

Gentleman had behaved him&s;elf very well during the War, and had been Governour of <HI>Dun&s;tar</HI> Ca&s;tle, where the King had lodged when he was in the We&s;t. After the end of the War, and when all other places were &s;urrender'd in that County, He likewi&s;e &s;urrender'd That, upon fair Conditions, and made his Peace, and afterwards married a Wife with a competent Fortune, and liv'd quietly, without any &s;u&s;pi|cion of having le&s;&s;en'd his affection towards the King.</P>
<P><Q>THE King &s;ent <HI>Wilmot</HI> to him, and acquainted him where he was, and &startq;&endq;that he would gladly &s;peak with him.</Q> It was not hard for him to choo&s;e a good place where to meet, and thereupon the day was appointed. After the King had taken his leave of M^r^s <HI>Lane,</HI> who remain'd with her <MILESTONE N="10"> Cou&s;in <HI>Norton,</HI> the King, and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> met the Colonel; and, in the way, he met in a Town, through which they pa&s;&s;ed, M^r <HI>Kirton,</HI> a Servant of the King's, who well knew the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who had no other di&s;gui&s;e than the Hawk, but took no Notice of him, nor &s;u&s;pected the King to be there; yet that day made the King more wary of having him in his Company upon the Way. At the place of meeting, they re&s;ted only one night, and then the King went to the Colonel's Hou&s;e; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to Colonel</HI> Francis Wind|ham<HI>'s Hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE> where he re&s;ted many days, whil&s;t the Colonel projected at what place the King might embark, and how they might procure a Ve&s;&s;el to be ready there; which was not ea&s;y to find; there being &s;o great a fear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <MILESTONE N="20"> tho&s;e who were hone&s;t, that it was hard to procure any Ve&s;&s;el that was outward bound to take in any pa&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>THERE was a Gentleman, one M^r <HI>Elli&s;on,</HI> who liv'd near <HI>Lyme</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and was well known to Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> having been a Captain in the King's Army, and was &s;till looked upon as a very hone&s;t Man. With him the Colonel con&s;ulted, how they might get a Ve&s;&s;el to be ready to take in a couple of Gentlemen, friends of his, who were in danger to be arre&s;ted, and tran&s;port them into <HI>France.</HI> Though no Man would ask who the Per&s;ons were, yet it could not but be &s;u&s;pected who they were, at lea&s;t they concluded, that it was &s;ome of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Party. <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Lyme</HI> was generally as malicious and di&s;affected a Town to the King's Intere&s;t, as any Town in <HI>England</HI> could be: yet there was in it a Ma&s;ter of a Bark, of who&s;e hone&s;ty this Captain was very confident. <Q>This Man was lately return'd from <HI>France,</HI> and had unladen his Ve&s;&s;el, when <HI>El|li&s;on</HI> asked him, &startq;when he would make another Voyage? and he an|&s;wer'd,&endq; a&s;&s;oon as he could get Lading for his Ship.</Q> <Q>The other asked, &startq;whether he would undertake to carry over a couple of Gentlemen, and land them in <HI>France,</HI> if he might be as well paid for his Voyage as&endq; he u&s;ed to be when he was fraighted by the Merchants.</Q> <Q>In conclu&s;ion, he told him, &startq;he &s;hould receive fifty pounds for his fare: the large re|compence <MILESTONE N="40"> had that effect, that the Man undertook it; though he &s;aid he mu&s;t make his provi&s;ion very &s;ecretly; for that he might be well &s;u&s;pected for going to Sea again without being fraighted, after he was&endq; &s;o newly return'd.</Q> Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> being adverti&s;ed of this, came together with the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> to the Captain's Hou&s;e, from whence the Lord and the Captain rid to a Hou&s;e near <HI>Lyme;</HI> where the Ma&s;ter of the Bark met them; and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> being &s;atisfied with the di&s;cour&s;e of the Man, and his warine&s;s in fore&s;eeing Su&s;picions, which would ari&s;e, it was re&s;olv'd that on &s;uch a night, which, upon con&s;idera|tion <MILESTONE N="50"> of the Tydes, was agreed upon, the Man &s;hould draw out his Ve&s;&s;el from the Peer, and, being at Sea, &s;hould come to &s;uch a point about a Mile from the Town, where his Ship &s;hould remain upon the Beach
<PB N="329" REF="3450">
when the Water was gone; which would take it off again about break of day the next morning. There was very near that point, even in the view of it, a &s;mall Inn, kept by a Man who was reputed hone&s;t, to which the Cavaliers of the Country often re&s;orted; and <HI>London</HI> road pa&s;&s;ed that way; &s;o that it was &s;eldom without Company. Into that Inn the two Gentlemen were to come in the beginning of the night, that they might put them&s;elves on board. All things being thus con|certed, and good earne&s;t given to the Ma&s;ter, the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> and the Colonel return'd to the Colonel's hou&s;e, above a day's journey from the place, the Captain undertaking every day to look that the Ma&s;ter &s;hould <MILESTONE N="10"> provide, and, if any thing fell out contrary to expectation, to give the Colonel notice at &s;uch a place, where they intended the King &s;hould be the day before he was to embark.</P>
<P>THE King, being &s;atisfied with the&s;e preparations, came, at the time <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The$$e He is brought to an Inn near</HI> $y$$e; <HI>and a Ship hired by Captain</HI> Elli|&s;on.</NOTE> appointed, to that Hou&s;e where he was to hear that all went as it ought to do; of which he receiv'd a&s;&s;urance from the Captain; who &s;ound that the Man had hone&s;tly put his Provi&s;ions on Board, and had his Com|pany ready, which were but four Men; and that the Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be drawn out that night: &s;o that it was fit for the two Per&s;ons to come $$ the afore&s;aid Inn, and the Captain conducted them within &s;ight of it; and then went to his own Hou&s;e, not di&s;tant a mile from it; the Colo|nel <MILESTONE N="20"> remaining &s;till at the Hou&s;e where they had lodged the night before, till he might hear the news of their being embark'd.</P>
<P>THEY found many Pa&s;&s;engers in the Inn; and &s;o were to be con|tented <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship fail'd by an accident; and the King left the Inn.</NOTE> with an ordinary Chamber, which they did not intend to &s;leep long in. But a&s;&s;oon as there appear'd any light, <HI>Wilmot</HI> went out to di&s;cover the Bark, of which there was no appearance. In a word, the Sun aro&s;e, and nothing like a Ship in view. They &s;ent to the Captain, who was as much amaz'd; and He &s;ent to the Town; and his Servant could not find the Ma&s;ter of the Bark, which was &s;till in the Peer. They &s;u&s;pected the Captain, and the Captain &s;u&s;pected the Ma&s;ter. <MILESTONE N="30"> However, it being pa&s;t ten of the Clock, they concluded it was not fit for them to &s;tay longer there, and &s;o they mounted their Hor&s;es again to return to the Hou&s;e where they had left the Colonel, who, they knew, re&s;olv'd to &s;tay there till he were a&s;&s;ur'd that they were gone.</P>
<P>THE truth of the di&s;appointment was this; the Man meant hone&s;tly, and made all things ready for his departure; and the night he was to go out with his Ve&s;&s;el, he had &s;tay'd in his own Hou&s;e, and &s;lept two or three hours, and the time of the Tide being come, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to be on board, he took out of a Cupboard &s;ome Linen, and other things, which he u&s;ed to carry with him to Sea. His Wife had ob&s;erv'd, that <MILESTONE N="40"> he had been for &s;ome days fuller of thoughts than he u&s;ed to be, and that he had been &s;peaking with Seamen, who u&s;ed to go with him, and that &s;ome of them had carried provi&s;ions on board the Bark; of which &s;he had ask'd her Husband the rea&s;on; <Q>who had told her, &startq;that he was&endq; promi&s;ed fraight &s;peedily, and therefore he would make all things ready.</Q> She was &s;ure that there was yet no lading in the Ship, and therefore, when &s;he &s;aw her Husband take all tho&s;e Materials with him, which was a &s;ure &s;ign that he meant to go to Sea, and it being late in the night, &s;he &s;hut the door, and &s;wore he &s;hould not go out of his Hou&s;e. <Q>He <MILESTONE N="50"> told her, &startq;he mu&s;t go, and was engaged to go to Sea that night; for&endq; which he &s;hould be well paid.</Q> <Q>His Wife told him, &startq;&s;he was &s;ure he was doing &s;omewhat that would undo him, and &s;he was re&s;olv'd he &s;hould
<PB N="330" REF="3460">
not go out of his Hou&s;e; and if he &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in it, &s;he would tell the Neighbours, and carry him before the Mayor to be examin'd, that&endq; the truth might be found out.</Q> The poor Man, thus ma&s;ter'd by the pa&s;&s;ion and violence of his Wife, was forced to yield to her, that there might be no farther noi&s;e; and &s;o went into his bed.</P>
<P>AND it was very happy that the King's jealou&s;y ha&s;ten'd him from that Inn. It was the &s;olemn fa&s;t day, which was ob&s;erv'd in tho&s;e times principally to enflame the People again&s;t the King, and all tho&s;e who were loyal to him, and there was a Chapel in that Village over again&s;t that Inn, where a Weaver, who had been a Soldier, u&s;ed to preach, and utter all the villainy imaginable again&s;t the old Order of Government: <MILESTONE N="10"> <Q>and he was then in the Chapel preaching to his Congregation, when the King went from thence, and telling the People &startq;that <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> was lurking &s;omewhere in that Country, and that they would merit&endq; from God Almighty, if they could find him out.</Q> The Pa&s;&s;engers, who had lodged in the Inn that night, had, a&s;&s;oon as they were up, &s;ent for a Smith to vi&s;it their Hor&s;es, it being a hard fro&s;t. The Smith, when <NOTE PLACE="marg">Like to be di&s;|cover'd by a Smith &s;hooing their Hor&s;es.</NOTE> he had done what he was &s;ent for, according to the cu&s;tom of that Peo|ple, examin'd the feet of the other two Hor&s;es to find more work. <Q>When he had ob&s;erv'd them, he told the Ho&s;t of the Hou&s;e, &startq;that one of tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="20"> Hor&s;es had travel'd far; and that he was &s;ure that his four Shooes had&endq; been made in four &s;everal Counties;</Q> which, whether his skill was able to di&s;cover or no, was very true. The Smith going to the Sermon told this &s;tory to &s;ome of his Neighbours; and &s;o it came to the ears of the Preacher, when his Sermon was done. Immediately he &s;ent for an Officer, and &s;earch'd the Inn, and enquir'd for tho&s;e Hor&s;es; and being inform'd that they were gone, he cau&s;ed Hor&s;es to be &s;ent to follow them, and to make enquiry after the two Men who rid tho&s;e Hor&s;es, and po&s;itively declared "that one of them was <HI>Charles Stuart.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN they came again to the Colonel, they pre&s;ently concluded that they were to make no longer &s;tay in tho&s;e parts, nor any more to <MILESTONE N="30"> endeavour to find a Ship upon that Coa&s;t; and without any farther delay, they rode back to the Colonel's Hou&s;e; where they arriv'd in the night. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King goes back to the Co|lonel's Hou&s;e.</NOTE> Then they re&s;olv'd to make their next attempt in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> where Colonel <HI>Windham</HI> had no Intere&s;t. They mu&s;t pa&s;s through all <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> before they came thither; which would require many days journey: and they were fir&s;t to con&s;ider what hone&s;t Hou&s;es there were in or near the way, where they might &s;ecurely repo&s;e; and it was thought very dangerous for the King to ride through any great Town, as <HI>Salis|bury,</HI> or <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> which might probably lie in their way. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THERE was between that and <HI>Salisbury</HI> a very hone&s;t Gentleman, Colonel <HI>Robert Philips,</HI> a younger Brother of a very good Family, which had allways been very Loyal; and he had &s;erv'd the King during the War. The King was re&s;olv'd to tru&s;t him; and &s;o &s;ent the Lord <HI>Wil|mot</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King &s;ends</HI> Wilmot <HI>for</HI> Robert Phi|lips.</NOTE> to a place from whence he might &s;end to M^r <HI>Philips</HI> to come to him, and when he had &s;poken with him, M^r <HI>Philips</HI> &s;hould come to the King, and <HI>Wilmot</HI> was to &s;tay in &s;uch a place as they two &s;hould agree. M^r <HI>Philips</HI> accordingly came to the Colonel's Hou&s;e; which he could do without &s;u&s;picion, they being nearly ally'd. The ways were very full of Soldiers; which were &s;ent now from the Army to their Quarters, <MILESTONE N="50"> and many Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot were a&s;&s;ign'd for the We&s;t; of which divi&s;ion <HI>Desborough</HI> was Commander in chief. The&s;e marches were like to la&s;t for many days, and it would not be fit for the King to

Thereupon, he re&s;orted to his old Security <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Who conducts him to a place near</HI> Salisbury</NOTE> of taking a Woman behind him, a Kin&s;woman of Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> whom he carried in that manner to a place not far from <HI>Salisbury;</HI> to which Colonel <HI>Philips</HI> conducted him.

<P>HERE he lay concealed, without the knowledge of &s;ome Gentlemen who liv'd in the Hou&s;e, and of others who daily re&s;orted thither, for many days, the Widow her &s;elf only attending him with &s;uch things as were nece&s;&s;ary, and bringing him &s;uch Letters as the D^r receiv'd from the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Philips.</HI> A Ve&s;&s;el being at la&s;t provided upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and notice thereof &s;ent to D^r <HI>Hinchman,</HI> he &s;ent to the King to meet him at <HI>Stone-henge</HI> upon the plains three miles <MILESTONE N="30"> from <HI>Heale;</HI> whither the Widow took care to direct him; and being there met, he attended him to the place where Colonel <HI>Philips</HI> receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to a Hou&s;e in</HI> Su&s;|&s;ex <HI>near Bright-hem|&s;ted; where a Bark was pro|vided by Colo|nel</HI> Gunter. <HI>He arrives in</HI> Normandy <HI>in a &s;mall Creek in</HI> Novemb.</NOTE> him.

<P><Q>THE Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who was then at his Hou&s;e at <HI>Titchfield</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> had been adverti&s;ed of the King's being in the We&s;t, and <MILESTONE N="40"> of his mi&s;&s;ing his pa&s;&s;age at <HI>Lyme,</HI> and &s;ent a tru&s;ty Gentleman to tho&s;e faithful Per&s;ons in the Country, who, he thought, were mo&s;t like to be employed for his E&s;cape if he came into tho&s;e parts, to let them know, &startq;that he had a Ship ready, and if the King came to him, he &s;hould be&endq; &s;afe;</Q> which adverti&s;ement came to the King the night before he em|barked, and when his Ve&s;&s;el was ready.

And though he did not believe that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> would behave them&s;elves with <MILESTONE N="30"> more fidelity, and courage for the King's Intere&s;t, when he &s;hould be gone; well knowing that their Bi&s;hops and Clergy de&s;ign'd nothing but to put them&s;elves under the Government of &s;ome Popi&s;h Prince, and had at that time &s;ent Agents into foreign parts for that purpo&s;e; yet he knew likewi&s;e that there were in truth Men enough, and Armes, and all provi&s;ions for the carrying on the War, who, if they were united, and heartily re&s;olv'd to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, would be much &s;uperior in number to any power <HI>Ireton</HI> could bring again&s;t them.

From the time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was cho&s;en General in the place of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> he took all occa&s;ions to di&s;coun|tenance the Presbyterians, and to put them out of all Tru&s;t and imploy|ment, as well in the Country as in the Army; and, whil&s;t he was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had intercepted &s;ome Letters from one <HI>Love,</HI> a Presbyte|rian <MILESTONE N="40"> Mini&s;ter in <HI>London</HI> (a fellow who hath been mention'd before, in the time the Treaty was at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> for preaching again&s;t Peace) to a leading Preacher in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;ent &s;uch an information again&s;t him, with &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive In&s;tances that Ju&s;tice might be exemplarily done upon him, that, in &s;pight of all the oppo&s;ition which the Presbyterians could make, who appear'd publickly with their utmo&s;t power, the Man was condemn'd and executed upon <HI>Tower-</HI>hill.

<P>IT is a wonderful thing what operation this Presbyterian Spirit had
<PB N="338" REF="3540">
upon the minds of tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by it. This poor Man <HI>Love,</HI> who had been guilty of as much Trea&s;on again&s;t the King, from the be|ginning of the Rebellion, as the Pulpit could contain, was &s;o much with|out remor&s;e for any wickedne&s;s of that kind that he had committed, that he was jealous of nothing &s;o much, as of being &s;u&s;pected to repent, or that he was brought to &s;uffer for his Affection to the King. And there|fore when he was upon the Scaffold, where he appear'd with a mar|vellous undauntedne&s;s, he &s;eem'd &s;o much delighted with the memory of all that he had done again&s;t the late King, and again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, that he could not even then forbear to &s;peak with animo&s;ity and bitter|ne&s;s <MILESTONE N="10"> again&s;t both, and expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction in mind for what he had done again&s;t them, and was as much tran&s;ported with the inward Joy of mind, that he felt in being brought thither to die as a Martyr, and to give te&s;timony for the Covenant; <Q>&startq;what&s;oever he had done being in the pur&s;uit of the ends, he &s;aid, of that &s;anctified obligation, to which&endq; he was $n and by his Con&s;cience engaged.</Q> And in this raving fit, with|out &s;o much as praying for the King, otherwi&s;e than that he might pro|pagate the Covenant, he laid his head upon the block with as much Courage as the brave&s;t, and hone&s;te&s;t Man could do in the mo&s;t pious occa&s;ion. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Cromwell</HI> return'd to <HI>London,</HI> he cau&s;ed &s;everal High Courts <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>cau&s;es &s;everal HighCourts of Ju&s;tice to be erected.</HI></NOTE> of Ju&s;tice to be erected, by which many Gentlemen of quality were con|demn'd, and executed in many parts of the Kingdom, as well as in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> who had been taken Pri&s;oners at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> or di&s;cover'd to have been there.

And under the&s;e de&s;olate apprehen&s;ions all the Royal and Loyal Party lay groveling, <MILESTONE N="30"> and pro&s;trate, after the defeat of <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was at this time with the King the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who came thither before the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Though his Maje&s;ty was now in unque&s;tionable &s;afety, the &s;treights and nece&s;&s;ities <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's ne|ce&s;&s;ities at</HI> $Word$</NOTE> he was in were as unque&s;tionable; which expo&s;ed him to all the trou|bles and unea&s;ine&s;s that the Ma&s;ters of very indigent families are &s;ub|jected to; and the more, becau&s;e all Men con&s;ider'd only his Dignity, and not his Fortune: &s;o that Men had the &s;ame emulations, and ambi|tions, as if the King had all to give which was taken from him, and thought it a good Argument for them to ask, becau&s;e he had nothing to <MILESTONE N="40"> give; and ask'd very improper Rever&s;ions, becau&s;e he could not grant the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and were &s;ollicitous for Honours, which he had power to grant, becau&s;e he had not Fortunes to give them.</P>
<P>THERE had been a great acquaintance between the Marquis of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The friend&s;hip $Word$ $$ the $Word$ of $Word$ and $Word$ of the Exche|quer</NOTE> when he was Lord <HI>Thurles,</HI> in the life of his Grandfather, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which was renew'd, by a mutual cor|re&s;pondence, when they both came to have &s;hares in the publick bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the one in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the other in <HI>England:</HI> &s;o that when they now met at <HI>Paris,</HI> they met as old friends, and quickly under&s;tood each other &s;o well, that there could not be a more entire confidence between <MILESTONE N="50"> Men. The Marquis con&s;ulted with him in his neare&s;t concernments, and the Chancellor e&s;teem'd, and cultivated the friend&s;hip with all po&s;|&s;ible indu&s;try and application. The King was abundantly &s;atisfied in
<PB N="339" REF="3550">
the friend&s;hip they had for each other, and tru&s;ted them both entirely; nor was it in the power of any, though it was often endeavour'd by Per&s;ons of no ordinary Account, to break or interrupt that mutual confidence between them, during the whole time the King remain'd be|yond the Seas; whereby the King's perplexed Affairs were carried on with the le&s;s trouble. And the Chancellor did allways acknowledge, that the benefit of this friend&s;hip was &s;o great to him, that, without it, he could not have borne the weight of that part of the King's bu&s;ine&s;s which was incumbent on him, nor the envy and reproach that attended the tru&s;t. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>BESIDES the wants and nece&s;&s;ities which the King was pre&s;&s;ed with in re&s;pect of him&s;elf, who had nothing, but was obliged to find him&s;elf by credit in Cloaths, and all other nece&s;&s;aries for his Per&s;on, and of his Family, which he &s;aw reduced to all extremities; he was much di&s;|quieted by the nece&s;&s;ities in his Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Family, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Nece&s;&s;ities and Factions of the Duke of</HI> York<HI>'s Fa|mily.</HI></NOTE> by the di&s;order and faction in it. The Queen complain'd heavily of S^r <HI>George Ratcliff,</HI> and the Atturney; and more of the fir&s;t, becau&s;e that he pretended to &s;ome Right of being of the Duke's Family by a Grant of the late King; which his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty determin'd again&s;t him; and reprehended his Activity in the la&s;t Summer. S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> had <MILESTONE N="20"> mo&s;t of the Queen's favour; and though he had at that time no Intere&s;t in the Duke's Affection, he found a way to ingratiate him&s;elf with his Royal Highne&s;s, by in&s;inuating into him two particulars, in both which he fore&s;aw advantage to him&s;elf. Though no Man acted the Governour's part more imperiou&s;ly than He had done whil&s;t the Lord <HI>Byron</HI> was ab&s;ent, finding that he him&s;elf was liable in &s;ome degree to be govern'd upon that Lord's return, he had u&s;ed all the ways he could, that the Duke might be exempted from any Subjection to a Governour, pre|&s;uming, that, when that Title &s;hould be extingui&s;hed, he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome &s;uch Office and relation, as &s;hould not be under the <MILESTONE N="30"> controle of any but the Duke him&s;elf. But he had not yet been able to bring that to pa&s;s; which was the rea&s;on that he &s;tayed at <HI>Paris</HI> when his Highne&s;s vi&s;ited <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> <Q>Now he took advantage of the Activity of the Duke's Spirit, and infu&s;ed into him, &startq;that it would be for his Honour to put him&s;elf into Action, and not to be learning&endq; his Exerci&s;es in <HI>Paris</HI> whil&s;t the Army was in the Field:</Q> <Q>a Propo&s;ition fir&s;t intimated by the Cardinal, &startq;that the Duke was now of years to learn his <HI>me&s;tier,</HI> and had now the opportunity to improve him&s;elf, by being in the care of a General reputed equal to any Captain in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> with whom he might learn that experience, and make tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, as might enable him to &s;erve the King his Brother,&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> who mu&s;t hope to recover his Right only by the Sword.</Q> This the Car|dinal had &s;aid both to the Queen, and to the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> whil&s;t the King was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when no Man had the hardine&s;s to advi&s;e it in that conjuncture. But, after the King's Return from <HI>England,</HI> there wanted nothing but the Approbation of his Maje&s;ty; and no Man more de&s;ired it than the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> who had had good Command, and pre|ferr'd that kind of Life before that which he was obliged to live in at <HI>Paris.</HI> There was no need of Spurs to be employed to incite the Duke; who was mo&s;t impatient to be in the Army. <Q>And therefore S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> could not any other way make him&s;elf &s;o grateful to him, as by appearing to be of that mind, and by telling the Duke, &startq;that who|&s;oever oppo&s;ed it, and di&s;&s;waded the King from giving his con&s;ent,
<PB N="340" REF="3560">
was an Enemy to his Highne&s;s's Glory, and de&s;ired that he &s;hould live&endq; allways in Pupillage;</Q> <Q>not omitting to put him in mind, &startq;that his very entrance into the Army &s;et him at Liberty, and put him into his own di&s;po&s;al; &s;ince no Man went into the Field under the direction of a&endq; Governour;</Q> &s;till endeavouring to improve his prejudice again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould either di&s;&s;wade him from pur&s;uing that re&s;olution, or en|deavour to per&s;wade the King not to approve it; <Q>&startq;which, he told him,&endq; could proceed from nothing but want of Affection to his Per&s;on.</Q> By this means he hoped to rai&s;e a notable di&s;like in him of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, he believ'd, did not like the de&s;ign, becau&s;e he having &s;poken to him of it, the other had not enlarged upon it as <MILESTONE N="10"> an Argument that plea&s;ed him.</P>
<P>THE Duke pre&s;&s;ed it with earne&s;tne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, in which he di&s;|&s;embled not; and found the Queen, as well as the King, very re&s;erv'd in the point; which proceeded from their tenderne&s;s towards him, and le&s;t they might be thought to be le&s;s concern'd for his &s;afety than they ought to be. His Highne&s;s then conferr'd with tho&s;e, who, he thought, were mo&s;t like to be con&s;ulted with by the King, among&s;t whom he knew the Chancellor was one; and finding him to &s;peak with le&s;s warmth than the re&s;t, as if he thought it a matter worthy of great deliberation, <MILESTONE N="20"> his Highne&s;s was confirm'd in the jealou&s;y which S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> had kindled in him, that He was the principal Per&s;on who ob&s;tructed the King's conde&s;cen&s;ion. There was at that time no Man with the King, who had been a Coun&s;ellor to his Father, or &s;worn to Him&s;elf, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> though he had admini&s;tred the Affairs in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was never &s;worn a Coun&s;ellor in <HI>England;</HI> yet his Maje&s;ty look'd upon him in all re&s;pects mo&s;t fit to ad|vi&s;e him; and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to form &s;uch a Body, as &s;hould be e&s;teem'd by all Men as his Privy Council, without who&s;e advice he would take no re&s;olutions. The King knew the Queen would not be <MILESTONE N="30"> well plea&s;ed, if the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> were not one; who in all other re&s;pects was nece&s;&s;ary to that Tru&s;t, &s;ince all Addre&s;&s;es to the Court of <HI>France</HI> were to be made by him: and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who had cultivated the King's Affection during the time of their Peregrination, and drawn many promi&s;es from him, and was full of projects for his Service, could not be left out. The King therefore called the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ap|points a new Council</NOTE> Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> to the Council-Board; <Q>and de|clared &startq;that they three, together with the Chancellor of the Exche|quer,&endq; &s;hould be con&s;ulted with in all his Affairs.</Q> <Q>The Queen very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed the King, &startq;that S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> might likewi&s;e be&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> made a Coun&s;ellor;</Q> which his Maje&s;ty would not con&s;ent to; and thought he could not refu&s;e the &s;ame honour to the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> or any other Per&s;on who &s;hould wait upon him, if he granted it to S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who had no manner of pretence.</P>
<P>BERKLEY took this refu&s;al very heavily, and thought his great parts, and the &s;ervices he had perform'd, which were known to very few, might well enough di&s;tingui&s;h him from other Men. But becau&s;e he would not be thought without &s;ome ju&s;t pretence which others had not, he very confidently in&s;i&s;ted upon a Right he had, by a promi&s;e of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">$$ John Berk|ley <HI>pretends to the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Wards</HI></NOTE> late King, to be Ma&s;ter of the Wards; and that Officer had u&s;ually been <MILESTONE N="50"> of the Privy Council. The evidence he had of that promi&s;e, was an in|tercepted Letter from the late King to the Queen, which the Parlia|ment had cau&s;ed to be printed. In that Letter the King an&s;wer'd a
<PB N="341" REF="3570">
Letter he had receiv'd from her Maje&s;ty, in which &s;he put him in mind, <Q>&startq;that he had promi&s;ed her to make <HI>Jack Berkley</HI> (which was the Style in the Letter)&endq; Ma&s;ter of the Wards;</Q> <Q>which, the King &s;aid, &startq;he won|der'd at, &s;ince he could not remember that &s;he had ever &s;poken to&endq; him to that purpo&s;e;</Q> <Q>implying likewi&s;e that he was not fit for it. He pre&s;&s;ed the Chancellor of the Exchequer &startq;to urge this matter of&endq; Right to the King (and &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;the Queen would declare the King had promi&s;ed it to her) and to prevail with his Maje&s;ty to make him pre|&s;ently Ma&s;ter of the Wards; which would give him &s;uch a Title to the Board, that others could not take his being called thither as a&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> prejudice to them.</Q></P>
<P>THE Chancellor had at that time much kindne&s;s for him, and did really de&s;ire to oblige him, but he dur&s;t not urge that for a rea&s;on to the King, which could be none, and what he knew, as well as a Nega|tive could be known, had no foundation of truth. For be&s;ides that he very well knew the late King had not &s;o good an opinion of S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> as he him&s;elf did at that time heartily wi&s;h, and endeavour to infu&s;e into him, the King had, after that promi&s;e was pretended to be made, granted that Office at <HI>Oxford</HI> to the Lord <HI>Cottington;</HI> who exe|cuted it as long as Offices were executed under the Grant of the Crown, <MILESTONE N="20"> and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Title to his death. The Chancellor did there|fore very earne&s;tly endeavour to di&s;&s;wade him from making that pre|tence and demand to the King; <Q>and told him, &startq;the King could not at this time do a more ungracious thing, that would lo&s;e him more the hearts and affections of the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> than in making a Ma&s;ter of the Wards, in a time when it would not be the lea&s;t Advantage to his Maje&s;ty or the Officer, to declare that he re|&s;olv'd to in&s;i&s;t upon that part of his Prerogative which his Father had con&s;ented to part with; the re&s;uming whereof in the full rigour, which he might lawfully do, would ruin mo&s;t of the E&s;tates of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> as well of his Friends as Enemies, in regard of the va&s;t Arrears incurr'd in &s;o many years; and therefore whatever his Maje&s;ty might think to re&s;olve hereafter, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to re&s;tore him,&endq; for the pre&s;ent there mu&s;t be no thought of &s;uch an Officer.</Q></P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Berkley</HI> was not &s;atisfied at all with the rea&s;on that was alledged; and very un&s;atisfied with the unkindne&s;s (as he called it) of the refu&s;al to interpo&s;e in it; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;&s;ince his friends would not, he&endq; would him&s;elf require ju&s;tice of the King;</Q> and immediately, hearing that the King was in the next room, went to him; <Q>and, in the warmth he had contracted by the Chancellor's contradiction, pre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty &startq;&endq;to make good the promi&s;e his Father had made;</Q> and magnified the <MILESTONE N="40"> Services he had done; which he did really believe to have been very great, and, by the cu&s;tom of making frequent relations of his own Actions, grew in very good earne&s;t to think he had done many things which no body el&s;e ever heard of. The King who knew him very well, and believ'd little of his Hi&s;tory, and le&s;s of his Father's promi&s;e, was willing rather to reclaim him from his importunity, than to give him a po&s;itive denial (which in his Nature his Maje&s;ty affected not) le&s;t it might indi&s;po&s;e his Mother or his Brother: and &s;o, to every part of his reque&s;t concerning the being of the Council, and concerning the Office, gave him &s;uch rea&s;ons again&s;t the gratifying him for the pre&s;ent, that <MILESTONE N="50"> he could not but plainly di&s;cern that his Maje&s;ty was very aver&s;e from it. But that con&s;ideration prevailed not with him; he u&s;ed &s;o great im|portunity,
<PB N="342" REF="3580">
notwith&s;tanding all the rea&s;ons which had been alledged, that at the la&s;t the King prevailed with him&s;elf, which he u&s;ed not to do in &s;uch Ca&s;es, to give him a po&s;itive denial, and reprehen&s;ion, at once; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de|nies it him.</NOTE> and &s;o left him.</P>
<P>ALL this he imputed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and though he knew well he had not, nor could have &s;poken with the King from the time they had &s;poken together, before him&s;elf had that Audience from his Maje&s;ty; <Q>he declared, &startq;that he knew all that Indi&s;po&s;ition had been infu&s;ed by him; becau&s;e many of the rea&s;ons, which his Ma|je&s;ty had given again&s;t his doing what he de&s;ired, were the very &s;ame&endq; that the Chancellor had urged to him;</Q> though they could not but <MILESTONE N="10"> have occurr'd to any rea&s;onable Man, who had been called to con&s;ult upon that Subject. This pa&s;&s;ion prevailed &s;o far upon him, that, not|with&s;tanding the advice of &s;ome of his be&s;t Friends to the contrary, he took an opportunity to walk with the Chancellor &s;hortly after; <Q>and, in a very calm, though a very confu&s;ed di&s;cour&s;e, told him, &startq;that, &s;ince he was re&s;olv'd to break all friend&s;hip with him, which had continued now near twenty years, he thought it but ju&s;t to give him notice of it, that from hence forward he might not expect any friend&s;hip from him, but that they might live towards each other with that civility&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> only that Strangers u&s;e to do.</Q> <Q>The Chancellor told him, &startq;that the &s;ame ju&s;tice that di&s;po&s;ed him to give this notice, &s;hould likewi&s;e oblige&endq; him to declare the rea&s;on of this re&s;olution;</Q> <Q>and asked him, &startq;whe|ther he had ever broken his word to him? or promi&s;ed to do what he&endq; had not done?</Q> <Q>He an&s;wer'd, &startq;his Exception was, that he could not be brought to make any promi&s;e; and that their judgements were &s;o&endq; different, that he would no more depend upon him:</Q> and &s;o they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whereupon S^r</HI> John <HI>breaks with the Chancellor.</HI></NOTE> parted, without ever after having conver&s;ation with each other whil&s;t they remain'd in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THE Spring was now advanced, and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> continued his importunity with the King, &startq;that he might have his leave to repair to&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> the Army.</Q> And thereupon his Maje&s;ty called his Council together, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>$eliberation in the Council, whether the Duke of</HI> York <HI>&s;hould go into the</HI> French <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> the Queen his Mother, and his Brother, being likewi&s;e pre&s;ent. <Q>There his Maje&s;ty declared &startq;what his Brother had long de&s;ired of him; to which he had hitherto given no other An&s;wer, than that he would think of it; and before he could give any other, he thought it nece&s;|&s;ary&endq; to receive their advice:</Q> nor did his Maje&s;ty in the lea&s;t di&s;cover what he him&s;elf was inclined to. The Duke then repeated what he had de&s;ired of the King; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he thought he asked nothing but what became him; if he did not, he hoped the King would not deny it to&endq; him, and that no body would advi&s;e he &s;hould.</Q> The Queen &s;poke <MILESTONE N="40"> not a word; and the King de&s;ired the Lords to deliver their opinion; who all &s;ate &s;ilent, expecting who would begin; there being no fixed Rule of the Board, but &s;ometimes, according to the Nature of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he who was fir&s;t in place begun, at other times he who was la&s;t in Quality; and when it required &s;ome debate before any opinion &s;hould be deliver'd, any Man was at liberty to offer what he would.

<P>THE in&s;upportable nece&s;&s;ities of the King were now grown &s;o noto|rious, that the <HI>French</HI> Court was compell'd to take notice of them; and thereupon, with &s;ome dry Compliments for the &s;mallne&s;s of the A&s;&s;igna|tion in re&s;pect of the ill condition of their Affairs, which indeed were not in any good po&s;ture, they &s;ettled an A&s;&s;ignation of &s;ix thou&s;and Li|vers <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The A&s;&s;igna|tion of &s;ix thou&s;and Li|vers by the month &s;ettled upon the King by the</HI> French <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> by the Month upon the King, payable out of &s;uch a Gabel; which, being to begin &s;ix Months after the King came thither, &s;ound too great a debt contracted to be ea&s;ily &s;atisfied out of &s;uch a Monthly receipt, though it had been punctually complied with; which it never was. <Q>The <MILESTONE N="30"> Queen, at his Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t arrival, had declared, &startq;that &s;he was not able to bear the charge of the King's dyet, but that he mu&s;t pay one half of the expence of her Table, where both their Maje&s;ties eat, with&endq; the Duke of <HI>York,</HI></Q> and the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta</HI> (which two were at the Queen's charge till the King came thither, but from that time, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was upon the King's Account) and the very fir&s;t night's Supper which the King eat with the Queen, begun the Account; and a Moiety thereof was charged to the King: &s;o that the fir&s;t Money that was receiv'd for the King upon his Grant, was entirely &s;topp'd by S^r <HI>Harry Wood,</HI> the Queen's Trea&s;urer, for the di&s;charge of his Maje&s;ty's part of the Queen's <MILESTONE N="40"> Table (which expence was fir&s;t &s;atisfied, as often as Money could be procured) and the re&s;t for the payment of other debts contracted, at his fir&s;t coming, for Cloaths and other Nece&s;&s;aries, there being great care taken that nothing &s;hould be left to be di&s;tributed among&s;t his Servants; the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> him&s;elf being compell'd to put him&s;elf in Pen|&s;ion, with other Gentlemen, at a Pi&s;tole a Week for his dyet, and to walk the Streets on foot, which was no honourable cu&s;tom in <HI>Paris;</HI> whil&s;t the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> kept an excellent Table for tho&s;e who courted him, and had a Coach of his own, and all other accommodations inci|dent to the mo&s;t full fortune; and if the King had the mo&s;t urgent oc|ca&s;ion <MILESTONE N="50"> for the U&s;e but of twenty Pi&s;toles, as &s;ometimes he had, he could not find credit to borrow it; which he often had experiment of.

if there had not been as much care to take that from him which was his own, as to hinder him from receiving the &s;upply a&s;&s;ign'd by the King of <HI>France,</HI> his Nece&s;&s;ities would not have been &s;o extraordinary. For when the King went to <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> in order to his journey into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and at the &s;ame time that he &s;ent the Chancellor of the Exchequer into <HI>Spain,</HI> he &s;ent likewi&s;e the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> into <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> to borrow Mo|ney of that Duke; and into <HI>Poland</HI> he &s;ent M^r <HI>Crofts</HI> upon the &s;ame er|rand.

<P>BUT, as if the King had been out of all po&s;&s;ible danger to want Mo|ney, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How the Mo|ney was di&s;|po&s;ed that was &s;ent the King from</HI> Mo&s;co <HI>and</HI> Poland.</NOTE> the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> had &s;ent an Expre&s;s into <HI>Scotland,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as he knew what &s;ucce&s;s the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> had at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and found there were no le&s;s hopes from M^r <HI>Crofts,</HI> and procured from the King (who could with more ea&s;e grant, than deny) Warrants under his hand to both tho&s;e Envoys, to pay the Monies they had receiv'd to &s;everal Per|&s;ons; whereof a con&s;iderable Sum was made a pre&s;ent to the Queen, more to the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> upon pretence of debts due to him, which were not dimini&s;h'd by that receipt, and all di&s;po&s;ed of according to the <MILESTONE N="20"> mode&s;ty of the Askers; whereof D^r <HI>Goffe</HI> had eight hundred pounds for Services he had perform'd, and, within few days after the receipt of it, changed his Religion, and became one of the Fathers of the Oratory: &s;o that, when the King return'd in all that di&s;tre&s;s to <HI>Paris,</HI> he never re|ceiv'd five hundred Pi&s;toles from the proceed of both tho&s;e Emba&s;&s;ies; nor did any of tho&s;e who were &s;upplied by his bounty, &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the obligation, or the more di&s;po&s;ed to do him any Service upon their own expence; of which the King was &s;en&s;ible enough, but re&s;olv'd to bear that and more, rather than, by entring into any Expo&s;tulation with tho&s;e who were faulty, to give any trouble to the Queen. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> who, in his own judgement, was very indifferent in all matters relating to Religion, was allways of &s;ome Faction that re|garded it. He had been much addicted to the Presbyterians from the time that there had been any Treaties with the <HI>Scots,</HI> in which he had too much privity. And now, upon the King's Return into <HI>France,</HI> he had a great de&s;ign to per&s;wade his Maje&s;ty to go to the Congregation at <HI>Charenton,</HI> to the end that he might keep up his Intere&s;t in the Presby|terian Party; which he had no rea&s;on to believe would ever be able to do the King &s;ervice, or willing, if they were able, without &s;uch odious conditions as they had hitherto in&s;i&s;ted upon in all their Overtures. The <MILESTONE N="40"> Queen did not, in the lea&s;t degree, oppo&s;e this, but rather &s;eem'd to countenance it, as the be&s;t Expedient that might incline him, by degrees, to prefer the Religion of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> For though the Queen had never, to this time, by her &s;elf, or by others with her advice, u&s;ed the lea&s;t means to per&s;wade the King to change his Religion, as well out of ob&s;ervation of the Injunction laid upon her by the decea&s;ed King, as out of the conformity of her own judgement, which could not but per&s;wade her that the Change of his Religion would infallibly make all his hopes of recovering <HI>England</HI> de&s;perate; yet it is as true, that, from the King's return from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> &s;he did really de&s;pair of his being <MILESTONE N="50"> re&s;tored by the Affections of his own Subjects; and believ'd that it could never be brought to pa&s;s without a conjunction of Catholick Princes on
<PB N="345" REF="3610">
his behalf, and by an united force to re&s;tore him; and that &s;uch a Con|junction would never be enter'd into, except the King him&s;elf became Roman Catholick. Therefore from this time &s;he was very well con|tent that any Attempts &s;hould be made upon him to that purpo&s;e; and, in that regard, wi&s;h'd that he would go to <HI>Charenton;</HI> which &s;he well knew was not the Religion he affected, but would be a little di&s;counte|nance to the Church in which he had been bred; and from which a&s;&s;oon as he could be per&s;waded in any degree to &s;werve, he would be more expo&s;ed to any other temptation. The King had not po&s;itively refu&s;ed to gratify the Mini&s;ters of that Congregation; who, with great pro|fe&s;&s;ions <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mini&s;ter&punc; of</HI> Charenton <HI>$Word$ King to come to their Church; and are &s;e|$onded by the Lord</HI> Jermyn.</NOTE> of duty, had be&s;ought him to do them that honour, before the Chancellor of the Exchequer came to him; in which it was believ'd, that they were the more like to prevail by the Death of D^r <HI>Steward;</HI> for who&s;e judgement in matters of Religion the King had reverence, by the earne&s;t recommendation of his Father: and he died after the King's return within fourteen days, with &s;ome trouble upon the importunity <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr</HI> Steward <HI>dies pre&s;ently after the King's return into</HI> France</NOTE> and artifice he &s;aw u&s;ed to prevail with the King to go to <HI>Charenton,</HI> though he &s;aw no di&s;po&s;ition in his Maje&s;ty to yield to it.</P>
<P><Q>THE Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> &s;till pre&s;&s;ed it, &startq;as a thing that ought in policy and di&s;cretion to be done, to reconcile that People, which was a great <MILESTONE N="20"> Body in <HI>France,</HI> to the King's Service, which would draw to him all the foreign Churches, and thereby he might receive con&s;iderable&endq; A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q> <Q>He wonder'd, he &s;aid, &startq;why it &s;hould be oppo&s;ed by any Man; &s;ince he did not wi&s;h that his Maje&s;ty would di&s;continue his own Devotions, according to the cour&s;e he had allways ob&s;erv'd; nor propo&s;e that he &s;hould often repair thither, but only &s;ometimes, at lea&s;t once, to &s;hew that he did look upon them as of the &s;ame Religion with him; which the Church of <HI>England</HI> had allways acknowledged; and that it had been an In&s;truction to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adours, that they &s;hould keep a good corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e of the Religion, and <MILESTONE N="30"> frequently re&s;ort to Divine Service at <HI>Charenton;</HI> where they had all|ways&endq; a Pew kept for them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer di&s;&s;waded his Maje&s;ty from going <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor of the Exche+quer di&s;&s;waded him from it.</NOTE> thither with equal earne&s;tne&s;s; told him, &startq;that, whatever counte|nance or favour, the Crown or Church of <HI>England,</HI> had heretofore &s;hew'd to tho&s;e Congregations, it was in a time when they carried them|&s;elves with mode&s;ty and duty towards both, and when they profe&s;&s;ed great duty to the King, and much reverence to that Church; lament|ing them&s;elves, that it was not in their power, by the oppo&s;ition of the State, to make their Reformation &s;o perfect as it was in <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> And by this kind of behaviour they had indeed receiv'd the Protection and Countenance from <HI>England</HI> as if they were of the &s;ame Religion, though, it may be, the Original of that Countenance and Protection proceeded from another le&s;s warrantable foundation; which he was &s;ure would never find credit from his Maje&s;ty. But, whatever it was, that People now had unde&s;erv'd it from the King; for, a&s;&s;oon as the Troubles begun, the Hugonots of <HI>France</HI> had generally expre&s;&s;ed great Malice to the late King, and very many of their Preachers and Mini|&s;ters had publikly and indu&s;triou&s;ly ju&s;tified the Rebellion, and pray'd for the good &s;ucce&s;s of it; and their Synod it &s;elf had in &s;uch a manner <MILESTONE N="50"> inveigh'd again&s;t the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that they, upon the matter, profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be of another Religion; and inveigh'd again&s;t Epi&s;copacy, as if it were incon&s;i&s;tent with the Prote&s;tant Religion.
<PB N="346" REF="3620">
That one of their great Profe&s;&s;ors at their Univer&s;ity of <HI>Saumur,</HI> who was look'd upon as a Man of the mo&s;t moderate &s;pirit among&s;t their Mini&s;ters, had publi&s;h'd an Apology for the general inclination of that Party to the proceedings of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> le&s;t it might give &s;ome jealou&s;y to their own King of their inclination to Rebellion, and of their opinion that it was lawful for Subjects to take up Armes again&s;t their Prince; which, he &s;aid, could not be done in <HI>France</HI> without manife&s;t Rebellion, and incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of God for the manife&s;t breach of his Commandments; becau&s;e the King of <HI>France</HI> is an ab&s;olute King, independent upon any other Authority. But that the Con&s;titution of the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> was of another Nature; becau&s;e the King there is &s;ubordinate to the Parliament, which hath Authority to rai&s;e Armes for the Reformation of Religion, or for the executing the publick Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom again&s;t all tho&s;e who vio|late the Laws of the Nation, &s;o that the War might be ju&s;t There,&endq; which in no ca&s;e could be warrantable in <HI>France.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Chancellor told the King, &startq;that, after &s;uch an indignity offer'd to him, and to his Crown, and &s;ince they had now made &s;uch a di&s;tinction between the Epi&s;copal and the Presbyterian Government, that they thought the Profe&s;&s;ors were not of the &s;ame Religion, his going to <HI>Cha|renton</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> could not be without this effect, that it would be concluded every where, that his Maje&s;ty thought the one or the other Profe&s;&s;ion to be indifferent; which would be one of the mo&s;t deadly wounds to&endq; the Church of <HI>England</HI> that it had yet ever &s;uffer'd.</Q> <Q>The&s;e rea&s;ons prevail'd &s;o far with the King's own natural aver&s;ion from what had been propo&s;ed, that he declared po&s;itively, &startq;he would never go to <HI>Cha|renton;&endq;</HI></Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de|clar'd he would not go.</NOTE> which determination ea&s;ed him from any farther application of that People. The reproach of this re&s;olution was wholely charged upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as the implacable Enemy of all Presbyterians, and as the only Man who diverted the King from having <MILESTONE N="30"> a good opinion of them; whereas in truth, the daily information he re|ceiv'd from the King him&s;elf of their barbarous behaviour in <HI>Scotland</HI> towards him, and of their in&s;upportable pride and pedantry in their Manners, did confirm him in the judgement he had allways made of their Profe&s;&s;ion; and he was the more grievous to tho&s;e of that Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e they could not, as they u&s;ed to do all tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed and cro&s;&s;ed them in that manner, accu&s;e him of being Popi&s;hly affected, and govern'd by the Papi&s;ts; to whom they knew he was equally odious; and the Queen's knowing him to be mo&s;t di&s;affected to her Religion, made her willing to appear mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ed for his hindering the King from going to <HI>Charenton.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was another Accident, which fell out at this time, and which the Chancellor of the Exchequer fore&s;aw would exceedingly increa&s;e the Queen's prejudice to him; which he did very heartily de&s;ire to avoid, and to recover her Maje&s;ty's favour by all the ways he could pur&s;ue with his duty; and, in con&s;i&s;tence with that, did never, in the lea&s;t degree, di&s;po&s;e his Maje&s;ty to deny any thing to her which &s;he own'd the de|&s;ire of.

a Man of great honour and courage, and much the be&s;t Officer the <HI>Scots</HI> had, &s;o they had a hatred of him proportionable; and they thought they had him at their Mercy, and might proceed again&s;t him more war|rantably for his life, than again&s;t their other Pri&s;oners; becau&s;e he had heretofore, in the beginning of the War, &s;erv'd them; and though he had quitted their Service at the &s;ame time when they ca&s;hier'd the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and made their new Model, and was at liberty to do what he thought be&s;t for him&s;elf, yet they re&s;olv'd to free them&s;elves from any farther apprehen&s;ions and fear of him: to that purpo&s;e they erected a new High Court of Ju&s;tice, for the Trial of &s;ome Per&s;ons who had been <MILESTONE N="10"> trouble&s;ome to them, and e&s;pecially <HI>Middleton</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>THIS la&s;t, after he had e&s;caped from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and travelled two or three days, found him&s;elf &s;o tormented and weaken'd by his Wounds, that being near the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> who&s;e Lieutenant Co|lonel he had been in the beginning of the War, and being well known to his Lady, he cho&s;e to commit him&s;elf to Her rather than to her Husband; hoping, that in honour &s;he would have found &s;ome means to pre&s;erve him.

<P>BUT now the Presbyterian intere&s;t &s;hew'd it &s;elf, and doubtle&s;s, in enterpri&s;es of this Nature, was very powerful; having in all places Per|&s;ons devoted to them, who were ready to obey their Orders, though they did not pretend to be of their Party.

But &s;ince they propo&s;ed pre&s;ent Di&s;patches to be made of Commi&s;&s;ions, and Letters, he wi&s;hed them to con&s;ider, whom they would be willing to tru&s;t in the performing that Service. <Q>The next day <MILESTONE N="30"> they attended his Maje&s;ty again, and de&s;ired, &startq;that all matters relating to <HI>Scotland</HI> might be con&s;ulted by his Maje&s;ty with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Lord <HI>Newburgh,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer;&endq; and that all the di&s;patches might be made by the Chancellor;</Q> which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King ap|points the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make all Di&s;patches for</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> the King con&s;ented to; and bid the Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI> go with them to him, and let him know his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure.

<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, be|liev'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s and the Chan|cellor's opinion concerning the King's Af|fairs at that time.</HI></NOTE> that the King had nothing at this time to do but to be quiet, and <MILESTONE N="40"> carefully avoid doing any thing that might do him hurt, and to expect &s;ome ble&s;&s;ed conjuncture from the Amity of Chri&s;tian Princes, or &s;ome &s;uch revolution of Affairs in <HI>England</HI> by their own di&s;contents, and divi&s;ions among&s;t them&s;elves, as might make it &s;ea&s;onable for his Ma|je&s;ty again to &s;hew him&s;elf.

But the de&s;igna|tion of them to this <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Intrigue, cro&s;&s;ed all this imagination, and <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;hook that foundation of Peace and tranquillity, upon which they had rai&s;ed their pre&s;ent hopes.</P>

<P>THIS uncomfortable condition of the King was render'd yet more <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Troubles of the</HI> French <HI>Court about this time.</HI></NOTE> de&s;perate, by the Streights, and Nece&s;&s;ities, into which the <HI>French</HI> Court was about this time plunged: &s;o that they who hitherto had &s;hew'd no very good will to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King, were now become really unable to do it. The Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> had behaved them&s;elves &s;o refractorily to all their King's commands, pre&s;&s;ed &s;o importunately for the liberty of the Princes, and &s;o impatiently for the remove of the Cardinal, that the Cardinal was at la&s;t compelled to per&s;wade the Queen to con&s;ent to both: and &s;o him&s;elf rid to <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> and deli|ver'd <MILESTONE N="10"> the Queen's Warrant to &s;et them at Liberty, and after a &s;hort con|ference with the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> he continued his own Journey to|wards <HI>Germany,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed in di&s;gui&s;e, with two or three Servants, till he came near <HI>Cologne,</HI> and there he remain'd at a Hou&s;e belonging to that Elector.</P>
<P>WHEN the Princes came to <HI>Paris,</HI> they had receiv'd great welcome from the Parliament, and the City; and in&s;tead of clo&s;ing with the Court, which it was thought they would have done, the wound was widen'd without any hope of reconciliation: &s;o that the King, and <MILESTONE N="20"> Queen Regent, withdrew from thence; the Town was in Armes; and Fire and Sword denounced again&s;t the Cardinal; his Goods &s;old at an outery; and a price &s;et upon his head; and all Per&s;ons who profe&s;&s;ed any duty to their King, found them&s;elves very un&s;afe in <HI>Paris.</HI> During all this time the Queen of <HI>England</HI> and the King, with their Families, remain'd in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> not knowing whither to go, nor well able to &s;tay there; the A&s;&s;ignements, which had been made for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, not being paid them: and the loo&s;e People of the Town begun to talk of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s being in Armes again&s;t them. But the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> under who&s;e name all the di&s;orders were committed, and the <MILESTONE N="30"> Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> vi&s;ited our King and Queen with many Profe&s;&s;ions of civility; but tho&s;e were &s;hortly abated likewi&s;e, when the <HI>French</HI> King's Army came upon one &s;ide of the Town, and the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI>'s, upon the other. The <HI>French</HI> Army thought they had the Enemy upon an advantage, and de&s;ired to have a Battle with them; which the other declined; all which time, the Court had an un|derhand Treaty with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> and, upon a day appointed, the <HI>French</HI> King &s;ent to the King of <HI>England,</HI> to de&s;ire him to confer with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> who lay then with his Army within a mile of the Town. There was no rea&s;on vi&s;ible for that de&s;ire, nor could it <MILESTONE N="40"> be conceiv'd, that his Maje&s;ty's interpo&s;ition could be of moment: yet his Maje&s;ty knew not how to refu&s;e it; but immediately went to the place a&s;&s;ign'd; where he found both Armies drawn up in Battalia within Cannon &s;hot of each other. Upon his Maje&s;ty's coming to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> the Treaty was again reviv'd, and Me&s;&s;ages &s;ent be|tween the Duke and Mar&s;hal <HI>Turenne.</HI> In fine, the night approaching, both Armies drew off from their ground, and his Maje&s;ty return'd to the <HI>Louvre;</HI> and before the next morning, the Treaty was fini&s;h'd be|tween the Court and the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> and he march'd away with his whole Army towards <HI>Flanders,</HI> and left the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;upport <MILESTONE N="50"> the Parliament again&s;t the power of the <HI>French</HI> Army; which advanced upon them with that re&s;olution, that, though they defended them&s;elves very bravely, and the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> did the Office of a brave General
<PB N="351" REF="3670">
in the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> S^t <HI>Marceaux,</HI> and at the Port S^t <HI>Antoine,</HI> in which places many gallant Per&s;ons of both &s;ides were &s;lain, they had been all cut off, if the City had not been prevail'd with to &s;uffer them to retire into it; which they had no mind to do. And thereupon the King's Army retired to their old Po&s;t, four Leagues off, and attended future advantages: the King having a very great Party in the Parliament and the City, which abhorr'd the receiving and entertaining the <HI>Spaniards</HI> into their bowels.</P>
<P>THIS Retreat of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> broke the neck of the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;'s</HI> de&s;ign. He knew well he &s;hould not be long able to retain <MILESTONE N="10"> the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> from treating with the Court, or keep the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> at his Devotion; and that the Duke <HI>de Beaufort,</HI> whom they had made Governour of <HI>Paris,</HI> would be weary of the contention. For the pre|&s;ent, they were all incen&s;ed again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> and were well enough contented that the People &s;hould believe, that this defection in the Duke was wrought by the activity, and interpo&s;ition of the King of <HI>England;</HI> and they who did know that his Intere&s;t could not have pro|duced that effect, could not tell how to interpret his Maje&s;ty's journey to &s;peak with the Duke in &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a conjuncture: &s;o that, as the People expre&s;&s;ed, and u&s;ed all the in&s;olent reproaches again&s;t the <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court at the <HI>Louvre,</HI> and loudly threaten'd to be revenged, &s;o neither the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> nor the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> made any vi&s;it there, or expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t civility towards it. In truth, our King and Queen did not think them&s;elves out of danger, nor &s;tirr'd out of the <HI>Louvre</HI> for many days, until the <HI>French</HI> Court thought them&s;elves obliged to provide for their &s;ecurity, by advi&s;ing the King and Queen to remove, and a&s;&s;ign'd S^t <HI>Germain</HI>'s to them for their Retreat. <Q>Then his Maje&s;ty &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> &startq;that their purpo&s;e&endq; was to leave the Town:</Q> upon which, there was a Guard that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King of</HI> England <HI>and his Mother $$ move to S^$</HI> German$$.</NOTE> attended them out of the Town at the evening; which could not be got to be in readine&s;s till then; and they were &s;hortly after met by &s;ome <MILESTONE N="30"> Troops of Hor&s;e &s;ent by the <HI>French</HI> King, which conducted them by Torch light to S^t <HI>Germain</HI>'s; where they arriv'd about midnight; and remain'd there without any di&s;turbance, till <HI>Paris</HI> was reduced to that King's obedience.</P>
<P>IT is a very hard thing for People who have nothing to do, to for|bear doing &s;omething which they ought not to do; and the King might well hope that, &s;ince he had nothing el&s;e le&s;t to enjoy, he might have enjoy'd quiet and repo&s;e; and that a Court which had nothing to give, might have been free from Faction and Ambition; whil&s;t every Man had compo&s;ed him&s;elf to bear the ill fortune he was reduced to for Con|&s;cience
<MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ake; which every Man pretended to be his ca&s;e, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and content, till it &s;hould plea&s;e God to buoy up the King from the low|ne&s;s he was in; who in truth &s;uffer'd much more than any body el&s;e. But whil&s;t there are Courts in the world, emulation and ambition will be in&s;eparable from them; and Kings who have nothing to give, &s;hall be pre&s;&s;ed to promi&s;e; which oftentimes proves more inconvenient and mi&s;chievous than any pre&s;ent gifts could be, becau&s;e they allways draw on more of the &s;ame title, and pretence; and as they who receive the fa|vours, are not the more &s;atisfied, &s;o they who are not paid in the &s;ame kind, or who, out of mode&s;ty and di&s;cretion, forbear to make &s;uch Suits, <MILESTONE N="50"> are griev'd and offended to &s;ee the vanity, and pre&s;umption of bold Men, &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably gratified and encouraged.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="3680">
THE King found no benefit of this kind in being &s;tripp'd of all his Do|minions, and all his Power. Men were as importunate, as hath been <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sollicitations for places in the King's Court.</NOTE> &s;aid before, for Honours, and Offices, and Revenues, as if they could have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them a&s;&s;oon as they had been granted, though but by promi&s;e: and Men who would not have had the pre&s;umption to have ask'd the &s;ame thing, if the King had been in <HI>England,</HI> thought it very ju&s;tifiable to demand it, becau&s;e he was Not there; &s;ince there were &s;o many hazards that they &s;hould never live to enjoy what he pro|mi&s;ed. The vexations he underwent of this kind, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed; and who&s;oever &s;ucceeded not in his unrea&s;onable de&s;ires imputed it only to the ill nature of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and concluded, <MILESTONE N="10"> that He alone ob&s;tructed it, becau&s;e they allways receiv'd very gracious An&s;wers from his Maje&s;ty: &s;o that though his wants were as vi&s;ible and notorious as any Man's, and it appear'd he got nothing for him&s;elf, he paid very dear in his peace and quiet for the credit, and intere&s;t he was thought to have with his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> had, by the opportunity of his late conver&s;ation with the King in his E&s;cape, drawn many kind expre&s;&s;ions from his Ma|je&s;ty; and he thought he could not be too &s;ollicitous to procure &s;uch a Te&s;timony of his Grace and Favour, as might di&s;tingui&s;h him from <MILESTONE N="20"> other Men, and publi&s;h the e&s;teem the King had of him. Therefore he importuned his Maje&s;ty that he would make him an Earl, referring the time of his Creation to his Maje&s;ty's own choice: and the mo|de&s;ty of this reference prevail'd; the King well knowing, that the &s;ame Honour would be de&s;ired on the behalf of another, by one whom he &s;hould be unwilling to deny. But &s;ince it was not ask'd for the pre|&s;ent, he promi&s;ed to do it in a time that &s;hould appear to be convenient for his Service.</P>
<P>THERE were Projects of another kind, which were much more trou|ble&s;ome; in which the Projectors &s;till con&s;ider'd Them&s;elves in the fir&s;t place, and what their condition might prove to be by the &s;ucce&s;s. The <MILESTONE N="30"> Duke of <HI>York</HI> was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the fatigue of the War, that he thought his condition very agreeable; but his Servants did not like that cour&s;e of life &s;o well, at lea&s;t de&s;ired &s;o far to improve it, that they might reap &s;ome Advantages to them&s;elves out of His Appointments.

<P>THERE was then a Lady in the Town, <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Longue|ville,</HI> the Daughter of the Duke <HI>de Longueville</HI> by his fir&s;t Wi&s;e, by whom &s;he was to inherit a very fair Revenue, and had title to a very con&s;iderable Sum of Money, which her Father was obliged to account for: &s;o that &s;he was look'd upon, as one of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t Mar|riages in <HI>France,</HI> in re&s;pect of her fortune; in re&s;pect of her Per&s;on not <MILESTONE N="50"> at all attractive, being a Lady of a very low &s;tature, and that &s;tature <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> John Berk|ley <HI>de&s;$g$$</HI> Ma|demoi&s;elle de $Word$ <HI>for $e Duke&punc;$ $$&s;e</HI></NOTE> &s;omewhat deform'd.

<P>IT was believ'd, that the fir&s;t Overture and Attempt had not been made without her Maje&s;ty's privity, and Approbation; for the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> had been no le&s;s active in the contrivance than S^r <HI>John Berkley:</HI> yet her Maje&s;ty refu&s;ed to deliver any opinion in it, till &s;he knew the King's: and &s;o at la&s;t, after the young Lady her &s;elf had been &s;poken to, his Maje&s;ty was inform'd of it, and his Approbation de&s;ired; with which he was not well plea&s;ed; and yet was unwilling to u&s;e his Authority to ob|&s;truct what was look'd upon as &s;o great a benefit and advantage to his Bro|ther; though he did not di&s;&s;emble his re&s;entment of Their pre&s;umption <MILESTONE N="30"> who undertook to enter upon Treaties of that Nature, with the &s;ame liberty as if it concern'd only their own kindred and allies: however, he was very re&s;erv'd in &s;aying what he thought of it.

and &s;aid, with &s;ome warmth, &startq;that &s;he would never give her con|&s;ent&endq; that it &s;hould be &s;o.</Q> However, this Argument was quickly made known to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and &s;everal glo&s;&s;es made upon it, to the re|proach of the Chancellor: yet it made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion, that there were then as active endeavours to find a convenient Wife for the King him&s;elf, and <HI>Mademoi&s;elle</HI> the Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> by his fir&s;t Wife, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mademoi&s;elle <HI>likewi&s;e thought on for the King.</HI></NOTE> who, in the Right of her Mother, was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fair inhe|ritance of the Dutchy of <HI>Mompen&s;ier,</HI> was thought of. To this the Queen was much inclined, and the King him&s;elf not aver&s;e; both looking too much upon the relief it might give to his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, and the con|venience <MILESTONE N="10"> of having a place to repo&s;e in, as long as the &s;torm &s;hould conti|nue. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had no thought, by the conclu|&s;ion he had made in the other Overture, to have drawn on this propo&s;i|tion; and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> and He were no le&s;s troubled with this, than with the former; which made them be look'd upon as Men of con|tradiction.</P>
<P><Q>THEY repre&s;ented to the King, &startq;that, as it could admini&s;ter only &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s and the Chancellor of the Exche|quer's exce|ption's again&s;t this.</HI></NOTE> competency towards his pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tence, &s;o it might exceedingly prejudice his future hopes, and alienate the affections of his Friends in <HI>England:</HI> that the Lady was elder than He by &s;ome years; which was <MILESTONE N="20"> an exception among&s;t private Per&s;ons; and had been ob&s;erv'd not to be pro&s;perous to Kings: That his Maje&s;ty mu&s;t expect to be pre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e things in point of Religion which he could never con&s;ent to; and yet he &s;hould undergo the &s;ame di&s;advantage as if he had con&s;ented, by many&endq; Men's believing he had done &s;o.</Q> <Q>They be&s;ought him &startq;to &s;et his heart entirely upon the recovery of <HI>England,</HI> and to indulge to nothing that might rea&s;onably ob&s;truct That, either by making him le&s;s intent upon&endq; it, or by creating new difficulties in the pur&s;uing it.</Q> <Q>His Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ur'd them &startq;that his heart was &s;et upon nothing el&s;e; and, if he had inclina|tion to this Marriage, it was becau&s;e he believ'd it might much facili|tate <MILESTONE N="30"> the other: that he look'd not upon her Fortune, which was very great, as an annual &s;upport to him, but as a &s;tock that &s;hould be at his di&s;po&s;al; by Sale whereof he might rai&s;e Money enough to rai&s;e a good Army to attempt the recovery of his Kingdoms: and that he would be well a&s;&s;ured, that it &s;hould be in his power to make that u&s;e of it, before he would be engaged in the Treaty: that he had no apprehen&s;ion of the pre&s;&s;ures which would be made in matters of Religion, becau&s;e, if the Lady did once con&s;ent to the Marriage, &s;he would affect nothing but what might advance the recovery of his Dominions; which &s;he would quickly under&s;tand any unrea&s;onable Conce&s;&s;ions in Religion could ne|ver&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> do.</Q> In a word, his Maje&s;ty di&s;cover'd enough to let them &s;ee that he &s;tood well enough inclined to the Overture it &s;elf; which gave them trou|ble, as a thing which, in many re&s;pects, was like to prove very inconvenient.</P>
<P>BUT they were quickly freed from that Apprehen&s;ion.

THERE was, &s;hortly after, an unexpected Accident, that &s;eem'd to make &s;ome alteration in the affairs of <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> which many very rea&s;onably believ'd, might have prov'd advantageous to the King. The Parliament, a&s;&s;oon as they had &s;ettled their Common-wealth, and had no Enemy they fear'd, had &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adours to their Si&s;ter Republick, the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment &s;ent Em|ba&s;&s;adours to</HI> Holland <HI>to in|v$te them to $ &s;tr$ct Union.</HI> Saint-Johns <HI>being the chief.</HI></NOTE> States of the united Provinces, to invite them to enter into a &s;tricter Al|liance with them, and, upon the Matter, to be as one Common-wealth; and to have one Intere&s;t. They were receiv'd in <HI>Holland</HI> with all imagi|nable re&s;pect, and as great Expre&s;&s;ions made, as could be, of an equal de|&s;ire <MILESTONE N="10"> that a firm Union might be e&s;tabli&s;h'd between the two Common|wealths: and, for the forming thereof, Per&s;ons were appointed to treat with the Emba&s;&s;adours; which was look'd upon as a matter that would ea&s;ily &s;ucceed, &s;ince the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who could have given power|ful ob&s;tructions in &s;uch Ca&s;es, was now dead, and all tho&s;e who adher'd to him, di&s;countenanced, and remov'd from places of tru&s;t and power in all the Provinces, and his Son an Infant, born after the Death of his Fa|ther, at the Mercy of the States even for his Support; the two Dowa|gers, his Mother and Grandmother, having great Joyntures out of the E&s;tate, and the re&s;t being liable to the payment of va&s;t debts. In the <MILESTONE N="20"> Treaty, <HI>Saint-Johns,</HI> who had the whole tru&s;t of the Emba&s;&s;y, being very powerful in the Parliament, and the known confident of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a kind of Union as mu&s;t di&s;unite them from all their other Allies: &s;o that, for the friend&s;hip of <HI>England,</HI> they mu&s;t lo&s;e the friend&s;hip of other Princes, and yet lo&s;e many other Advantages in Trade, which they enjoyed, and which they &s;aw the younger and more powerful Com|mon-wealth would in a &s;hort time deprive them of. This the States could not dige&s;t, and u&s;ed all the ways they could to divert them from in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;o unrea&s;onable conditions; and made many large Over|tures and Conce&s;&s;ions, which had never been granted by them to the <MILESTONE N="30"> greate&s;t Kings, and were willing to quit &s;ome Advantages they had en|joyed by all the Treaties with the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and to yield other con&s;iderable benefits which they allways before denied to grant.</P>
<P>BUT this would not &s;atisfy, nor would the Emba&s;&s;adours recede from any particular they had propo&s;ed: &s;o that, after &s;ome Months &s;tay, during which time they receiv'd many Affronts from &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and from others, they return'd with great Pre&s;ents from the States, but with|out <NOTE PLACE="marg">They return without any Effect</NOTE> any effect by the Treaty, or entring into any terms of Alliance, and with the extreme indignation of <HI>Saint-Johns;</HI> which he manife&s;ted a&s;|&s;oon as he return'd to the Parliament; who di&s;daining likewi&s;e to find <MILESTONE N="40"> them&s;elves undervalued (that is, not valued above all the world be&s;ides) pre&s;ently enter'd upon Coun&s;els how they might di&s;countenance and controle the Trade of <HI>Holland,</HI> and encrea&s;e their own.</P>
<P><Q>HEREUPON they made that Act that &startq;inhibits all Foreign Ships <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment there upon make the Act of Na$$|gation.</NOTE> from bringing in any Merchandi&s;e or Commodities into <HI>England,</HI> but &s;uch as were the proceed or growth of their own Country, upon the pe|nalty&endq; of forfeiture of all &s;uch Ships.</Q> This indeed concern'd all other Coun|tries; but it did, upon the matter, totally &s;uppre&s;s all Trade with <HI>Hol|land,</HI> which had very little Merchandi&s;e of the growth of their own Coun|try, but had u&s;ed to bring in their Ships the growth of all other King|doms <MILESTONE N="50"> in the world; Wine from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Spices from the In|dies, and all Commodities from all other Countries; which they mu&s;t now do no more. <Q>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour expo&s;tulated this matter very warmly, &startq;as a breach of Commerce and Amity, which could not con|&s;i&s;t with the Peace between the two Nations; and that his Ma&s;ters could&endq;

<P>THE United Provinces now di&s;cern'd, that they had help'd to rai&s;e an Enemy that was too powerful for them, and that would not be treated as the Crown had been. However, they could not believe it po&s;&s;ible, that in the Infancy of their Republick, and when their Government was manife&s;tly odious to all the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, and <MILESTONE N="10"> the People generally weary of the Taxes and Impo&s;itions upon the Na|tion for the &s;upport of their Land-Armies, the Parliament would venture to increa&s;e tho&s;e Taxes and Impo&s;itions proportionably to maintain a new War at Sea, at &s;o va&s;t an Expence, as could not be avoided; and therefore believ'd that they only made &s;hew of this Courage to amu&s;e and terrify them. However, at the Spring, They &s;et out a Fleet &s;tronger than of cour&s;e they u&s;ed to do; which made no impre&s;&s;ion upon the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> who never &s;u&s;pected that the <HI>Dutch</HI> dur&s;t enter into a War with them. Be|&s;ides that they were confident no &s;uch Coun&s;el and Re&s;olution could be taken on a &s;uddain, and without their having fir&s;t Notice of it, they <MILESTONE N="20"> having &s;everal of the States General, and more of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> very devoted to them. And therefore they increa&s;ed not their expence, but &s;ent out their u&s;ual Fleet for the Guard of the Coa&s;t at their Sea&s;on, and with no other In&s;tructions than they had been accu&s;tom'd to.</P>
<P><Q>THE Council of the Admiralty of <HI>Holland,</HI> which govern'd the Ma|ritime <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orders from the Admiralty in</HI> Holland <HI>to their Fleet,</HI> <Q><HI>&startq;not to &s;trike to the</HI> Eng|li&s;h.&endq;</Q></NOTE> Affairs, without communication with the States General, gave their In&s;tructions to the Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> &startq;that when he met any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships of War, he &s;hould not &s;trike to them, nor &s;hew them any other re&s;pect than what they receiv'd from them; and if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> expo&s;tulated the matter, they &s;hould an&s;wer frankly, that the <MILESTONE N="30"> re&s;pect they had formerly &s;hew'd upon tho&s;e Encounters, was becau&s;e the Ships were the King's, and for the good intelligence they had with the Crown; but they had no rea&s;on to continue the &s;ame in this altera|tion of Government, except there were &s;ome Stipulation between them to that purpo&s;e: and if this An&s;wer did not &s;atisfy, but that force was u&s;ed towards them, they &s;hould defend them&s;elves with their utmo&s;t&endq; vigour.</Q> The&s;e In&s;tructions were very &s;ecret, and never &s;u&s;pected by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commanders; who had their old In&s;tructions to oblige all Foreign Ve&s;&s;els to &s;trike &s;ail to them; which had never been refu&s;ed by any Nation. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>IT was about the beginning of <HI>May</HI> in the year 1652, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of above forty Sail, under the Command of <HI>Van Trump,</HI> rode at Anchor in <HI>Dover</HI> Road, being driven by a &s;trong Wind, as they pretended, from the <HI>Flanders</HI> Coa&s;t, when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, un|der the Command of <HI>Blake,</HI> of a much le&s;s Number, appear'd in view; upon which the <HI>Dutch</HI> weighed Anchor, and put out to Sea, without &s;triking their Flag; which <HI>Blake</HI> ob&s;erving, cau&s;ed three Guns to be fired <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The War be|gun upon thi$ Account with the</HI> Dutch</NOTE> without any Ball. It was then ob&s;erv'd, that there was an Expre&s;s Ketch came, at the very time, from <HI>Holland,</HI> on board their Admiral; and it was then conceiv'd, that he had, by that Expre&s;s, receiv'd more po&s;itive <MILESTONE N="50"> Orders to Fight: for upon the Arrival of that Expre&s;s, he tacked about, and bore directly towards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet; and the three Guns were no &s;ooner fired, but, in contempt of the Adverti&s;ement, he di&s;charged one &s;ingle Gun from his Poop, and hung out a red Flag; and came up to
<PB N="357" REF="3730">
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral, and gave him a broad &s;ide; with which he killed many of his Men, and damaged the Ship. Whereupon, though <HI>Blake</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed, as not expecting &s;uch an A&s;&s;ault, he deferr'd not to give him the &s;ame rude &s;alutation; and &s;o both Fleets were forthwith en|gaged in a very fierce Encounter; which continued for the &s;pace of four hours, till the night parted them, after the lo&s;s of much blood on both &s;ides. On the part of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they lo&s;t two Ships, whereof one was &s;unk, and the other taken, with both the Captains, and near two hundred Pri&s;oners. On the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide, there were many &s;lain, and more wounded, but no Ship lo&s;t, nor Officer of Name. When the <MILESTONE N="10"> morning appear'd, the <HI>Dutch</HI> were gone to their Coa&s;t. And thus the War was enter'd into, before it was &s;u&s;pected in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what con&s;ideration &s;oever the <HI>Dutch</HI> had embarked them&s;elves in this &s;uddain Enterpri&s;e, it quickly appear'd they had taken very ill mea&s;ures of the Peoples Affections. For the News of this conflict was no &s;ooner arriv'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> but there was the mo&s;t general con&s;terna|tion, among&s;t all &s;orts of Men, that can be imagin'd; and the States them&s;elves were &s;o much troubled at it, that, with great expedition, they di&s;patched two extraordinary Emba&s;&s;adours into <HI>England;</HI> <Q>by whom <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The States &s;end two Em|ba&s;&s;adours in|to</HI> England <HI>a+bout it.</HI></NOTE> they prote&s;ted, &startq;that the late unhappy Engagement between the Fleets <MILESTONE N="20"> of the two Common-wealths, had happen'd without their knowledge, and contrary to the intention of the Lords the States General: that they had receiv'd the fatal tidings of &s;o ra&s;h an Attempt, and Action, with amazement, and a&s;toni&s;hment; and that they had immediately enter'd into con&s;ultation, how they might be&s;t clo&s;e this fre&s;h bleeding Wound, and to avoid the farther Effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian blood, &s;o much de&s;ired by the Enemies of both States: and therefore they mo&s;t earne&s;t|ly de&s;ired them, by their mutual concurrence in Religion, and by their mutual love of Liberty, that nothing might be done with pa&s;&s;ion and heat; which would widen the breach; but that they might &s;peedily re|ceive <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;uch an An&s;wer, that there might be no farther ob&s;truction to the&endq; Trade of both Common-wealths.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To which this An&s;wer was pre&s;ently return'd to them, &startq;that the civi|lity <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment's An|&s;wer to them.</NOTE> which they had allways &s;hew'd towards the States of the United Provinces, was &s;o notorious, that nothing was more &s;trange than the ill return they had made to them: that the extraordinary preparations, which they had made, of a hundred and fifty Ships, without any appa|rent nece&s;&s;ity, and the In&s;tructions which had been given to their Sea Officers, had admini&s;ter'd too much cau&s;e to believe, that the Lords the States General of the United Provinces had a purpo&s;e to u&s;urp the known Right which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have to the Seas, and to de&s;troy their <MILESTONE N="40"> Fleets; which, under the protection of the Almighty, are their Walls and Bulwarks; that &s;o they might be expo&s;ed to the inva&s;ion of any powerful Enemy: therefore they thought them&s;elves obliged to endea|vour, by God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to &s;eek reparation for the injuries and damage they had already receiv'd, and to prevent the like for the future: How|ever, they &s;hould never be without an intention and de&s;ire, that &s;ome effectual means might be found to e&s;tabli&s;h a good peace, union, and&endq; right Under&s;tanding, between the two Nations.</Q></P>
<P>WITH this haughty An&s;wer they vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted their revenge, <MILESTONE N="50"> and commanded <HI>Blake</HI> pre&s;ently to &s;ail to the Northward; it being then the Sea&s;on of the year for the great Fi&s;heries of the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the I&s;les of <HI>Orkney</HI> (by the benefit whereof they drive a great part of their Trade over <HI>Europe)</HI> where he now found their multi|tude

<P>WHEN <HI>Blake</HI> was &s;ent to the North, S^r <HI>George Ay&s;cue,</HI> being ju&s;t re|turn'd from the We&s;t Indies, was &s;ent with another part of the Fleet to the South; who, at his very going out, met with thirty Sail of their Mer|chants between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Calais;</HI> a good part whereof he took, or &s;unk; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> G.

From thence he &s;tood We&s;tward; and near <HI>Plymouth,</HI> with thirty Sail of Men of War, he engaged the whole <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty Ships of War, and thirty Merchants. It was near <MILESTONE N="10"> four of the Clock in the afternoon when both Fleets begun to engage, &s;o that the night quickly parted them; yet not before two of the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships of War were &s;unk, and mo&s;t of the Men lo&s;t; the <HI>Dutch</HI> in that Action applying them&s;elves mo&s;t to &s;poil the tackling, and &s;ailes of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> in which they had &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that the next morning they were not able to give them farther cha&s;e, till their &s;ailes and rigging could be repaired.

<P>THE King thought he might very rea&s;onably hope to reap &s;ome be|nefit and advantage from this War, &s;o briskly enter'd upon on both &s;ides; and when he had &s;ate &s;till till the return of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;adours from <HI>London,</HI> and that all Treaties were given over, he believ'd it might con|tribute to his ends, if he made a journey into <HI>Holland,</HI> and made &s;uch Propo&s;itions upon the place as he might be advi&s;ed to: but when his Maje&s;ty imparted this de&s;ign to his Friends there, who did really de&s;ire <MILESTONE N="30"> to &s;erve him, he was very warmly di&s;&s;waded from coming thither; <Q>and a&s;&s;ured, &startq;that it was &s;o far from being yet &s;ea&s;onable, that it would more advance a Peace than any thing el&s;e that could be propo&s;ed; and would, for the pre&s;ent, bring the greate&s;t prejudice to his Si&s;ter, and to the af|fairs&endq; of his Nephew the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that could be imagin'd.</Q></P>
<P>THE King hereupon took a re&s;olution to make an attempt which could do him no harm, if it did not produce the good he de&s;ired.

He communicated in all things with great freedom with the Chancellor of the Exchequer; who vi&s;ited him con&s;tantly once a Week, and receiv'd Adverti&s;ements, and Advices from him, and the Emba&s;&s;adour frequently came to His lodging. The King, upon conference only with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor, and enjoyning them &s;ecrecy, cau&s;ed a Paper to be drawn up; <Q>in which he declared, &startq;that he had very good rea&s;on to be|lieve, that there were many Officers and Seamen engaged in the Service of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, who undertook that Service in hope to find a good <MILESTONE N="50"> opportunity to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty; and that, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> were willing to receive him, he would immediately put him&s;elf on board their Fleet, without requiring any Command, except of &s;uch Ships only, as, upon their notice of his being there, &s;hould repair to him out of the Rebel's&endq;

The Emba&s;&s;adour was very much &s;urpri&s;ed with it, and made &s;ome &s;cruple of &s;ending it, le&s;t he might be &s;u&s;pected to have advi&s;ed it. For they were extremely jealous of him for his Affection to the King, and for his de|pendence upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange.</HI> <Q>In the end, he de&s;ired &startq;the King would inclo&s;e it in a Letter to him, and oblige him to &s;end it to the States&endq; General: which was done accordingly;</Q> and he &s;ent it by the Po&s;t to the <MILESTONE N="10"> States.</P>
<P>THE War had already made the Councils of the States le&s;s united than they had been, and the Party that was known to be inclined to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> recover'd courage, and joyn'd with tho&s;e who were no friends to the War; and, when this Me&s;&s;age from the King was read, magnified the King's Spirit in making this Overture, and wi&s;h'd that an An&s;wer of very humble thanks and acknowledgement might be return'd to his Ma|je&s;ty. <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;no means ought to be neglected that might abate the&endq; pride and power of the Enemy:</Q> and a&s;&s;oon as the People heard of it, <MILESTONE N="20"> they thought it rea&s;onable to accept the King's Offer. <HI>D$ $it,</HI> who was Pen&s;ioner of <HI>Holland,</HI> and had the greate&s;t influence upon their Coun|&s;els, had no mind to have any conjunction with the King; which, he fore|&s;aw, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily introduce the pretences of the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> to whom he was an avow'd and declar'd Enemy. <Q>He told them, &startq;indeed it was a very generous offer of the King; but if they &s;hould accept it, they could never recede from his Intere&s;t; which, in&s;tead of putting an end to the War, of which they were already weary, would make it with|out end, and would be the ruin of their State: that, whil&s;t they were free from being engaged in any Intere&s;t but their own, they might rea|&s;onably <MILESTONE N="30"> hope that both &s;ides would be equally weary of the War, and then a Peace would ea&s;ily en&s;ue; which they &s;hould otherwi&s;e put out&endq; of their own power;</Q> &s;o that thanks were return'd to the King for his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Than$s re|turn'd to the King by the States, but $$$ propo&s;al laid a&s;$$$</NOTE> good Will; and they pur&s;ued their own method in their Coun&s;els, and were much &s;uperior to tho&s;e who were of another opinion, de&s;iring no|thing &s;o much, as to make a Peace upon any conditions.</P>
<P>NOR can it appear very wonderful, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> made &s;hew of &s;o much flegme in this Affair, when the very choler and pride of the <HI>French</HI> was, about the &s;ame time, &s;o humbled by the Spirit of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that, though they took their Ships every day, and made them prize, and had <MILESTONE N="40"> now &s;ei&s;ed upon their whole Fleet that was going to the relief of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The $Word$ &s;e$&s;e o$ a</HI> French <HI>$Word$ going to the $Word$ of</HI> Dun|kirk.</NOTE> (that was then clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and by the taking that Fleet, was deliver'd into their hands) yet the <HI>French</HI> would not be pro|vok'd to be angry with them, or to expre&s;s any inclination to the King; but &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;adour, which they had not before done, to expo&s;tu|late <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>&s;end an Em|ba&s;&s;ador $nto</HI> England</NOTE> very civilly with the Parliament for having been &s;o unneighbourly, but in truth to de&s;ire their friend&s;hip upon what terms they plea&s;ed; the Cardinal fearing nothing &s;o much, as that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would make &s;uch a conjunction with the new Common-wealth, as &s;hould di&s;appoint and break all his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>THE in&s;upportable lo&s;&s;es which the <HI>Dutch</HI> every day &s;u&s;tain'd by the taking their Merchant's Ships, and their Ships of War, and the total ob|&s;truction of their Trade, broke their hearts, and encrea&s;ed their factions and divi&s;ions at home. All the Seas were cover'd with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleets;

which made no di&s;tinctions of Sea&s;ons, but were as active in the Winter as the Summer: and engaged the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon any inequality of Number The <HI>Dutch</HI> having been beaten in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> and <HI>Blake</HI> having receiv'd a bru&s;h from them in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> in the Month of <HI>February,</HI> the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ea&s;on of the Year, They, having appointed a Rendezvous of about one hundred and fifty Merchant Men, &s;ent a Fleet of above one hundred Sail of Men of War to convoy them; and <HI>Blake,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> February $lake <HI>engages the</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet, who are beaten</HI></NOTE> with a Fleet much inferior in number, engaged them in a very &s;harp Bat|tle from noon till the night parted them: which di&s;po&s;ed them to endea|vour to pre&s;erve them&s;elves by flight; but, in the morning, they found that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had attended them &s;o clo&s;e, that they were engaged again <MILESTONE N="10"> to fight, and &s;o unpro&s;perou&s;ly, that, after the lo&s;s of above two thou&s;and Men, who were thrown overboard, be&s;ides a multitude hurt, they were glad to leave fifty of their Merchant Men to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they might make their flight the more &s;ecurely.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t lo&s;s made them &s;end again to the Parliament to de&s;ire a Peace; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>&s;end again to the Parlia|ment for Peace.</HI></NOTE> who rejected the Overture, as they pretended, "for want of formality (for they allways pretended a de&s;ire of an honourable Peace) the Addre&s;s being made only by the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and We&s;t<HI>-Friezland,</HI> the States General being at that time not a&s;&s;embled. It was generally believ'd, that this Addre&s;s from <HI>Holland</HI> was not only with the Approbation, but by <MILESTONE N="20"> the direction of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who had rather con&s;ented to tho&s;e particu|lars, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>ne|ver zealous for this War with the</HI> Dutch, <HI>but go|vern'd in it by</HI> Saint-Johns.</NOTE> which were naturally like to produce that War, to gratify <HI>Saint-Johns</HI> (who was in&s;eparable from him in all his other Coun&s;els, and was incen&s;ed by the <HI>Dutch)</HI> than approv'd the Re&s;olution. And now he found, by the expence of the Engagements had allready pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides, what an in&s;upportable Charge that War mu&s;t be attended with. Be&s;ides, he well di&s;cern'd that all Parties, Friends and Foes, Presbyterians, Inde|pendents, Levellers, were all united as to the carrying on the War; which, he thought, could proceed from nothing, but that the exce&s;s of the Ex|pence <MILESTONE N="30"> might make it nece&s;&s;ary to disband a great part of the Land Army (of which there appear'd no u&s;e) to &s;upport the Navy; which they could not now be without. Nor had he Authority to place his own Creatures there, all the Officers thereof being nominated and appointed &s;olely by the Parliament: So that when this Addre&s;s was made by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he &s;et up his whole re&s;t and intere&s;t, that it might be well accepted, and a Treaty thereupon enter'd into; which when he could not bring to pa&s;s, he laid to heart; and deferr'd not long, as will appear, to take vengeance upon the Parliament with a witne&s;s, and by a way they lea&s;t thought of.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Cromwell</HI> was exerci&s;ed with the&s;e contradictions and vexa|tions at home, by the Authority of the Parliament, he found not the <MILESTONE N="40"> lea&s;t oppo&s;ition from abroad. He was more ab&s;olute in the other two Kingdoms, more fear'd, and more obey'd, than any King had ever been; and all the Dominions belonging to the Crown, own'd no other &s;ubjection than to the Common-wealth of <HI>England.</HI> The I&s;les of <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Jer|&s;ey,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Guern&s;ey <HI>and</HI> Jer&s;ey <HI>had been now reduced S^r</HI> George Carteret <HI>de+fended this as long as $$ could, and</HI> E|lizabeth <HI>Ca|&s;tle</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Scilly,</HI> were reduced; the former pre&s;ently after the Battle of <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter;</HI> and the other, after the King's return to <HI>Paris;</HI> S^r <HI>George Carteret</HI> having well defended <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> as long as he could, and being &s;o over-power'd that he could no longer defend the <HI>I&s;land,</HI> he retired into Ca&s;tle <HI>Eliza|beth;</HI> which he had fortified, and provided with all things nece&s;&s;ary for a Siege; pre&s;uming that, by the care and diligence of the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> who was Governour thereof, he &s;hould receive Supplies of Men and Pro|vi&s;ions, as he &s;hould &s;tand in need of them; as he might ea&s;ily have done in &s;pight of any power of the Parliament by Sea, or Land. But it had
<PB N="361" REF="3770">
been the principal rea&s;on that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had hitherto kept the better Quarter with the Cardinal, le&s;t the bait of tho&s;e two I&s;lands, which the King could have put into his hands when he would, &s;hould tempt him to give his Maje&s;ty any A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the King was &s;o &s;trict and punctual in his care of the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> when he &s;eem'd to be abandon'd by it, that he cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer tho&s;e places of great importance to fall into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s power, than to depo&s;ite them, upon any conditions, into <HI>French</HI> hands; which, he knew, would never re&s;tore them to the ju&s;t owner, what obligations &s;oever they enter'd into.</P>
<P>WHEN that Ca&s;tle had been be&s;ieged three Months, and the Enemy <MILESTONE N="10"> could not approach nearer to plant their Ordnance than, at lea&s;t, half an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile, the Sea encompa&s;&s;ing it round more than &s;o far from any Land, and it not being po&s;&s;ible for any of their Ships to come within &s;uch a di&s;tance, they brought notwith&s;tanding Mortar-pieces of &s;uch an incre|dible greatne&s;s, and &s;uch as had never been before &s;een in this part of the world, that from the highe&s;t point of the Hill, near S^r <HI>Hilary's,</HI> they &s;hot Granadoes of a va&s;t bigne&s;s into the Ca&s;tle, and beat down many Hou&s;es; and, at la&s;t, blow'd up a great Magazine, where mo&s;t of the provi&s;ion of Victuals lay; and kill'd many Men. Upon which S^r <HI>George Carteret</HI> &s;ent an Expre&s;s, to give the King an Account of the condition he was in, and <MILESTONE N="20"> to de&s;ire a &s;upply of Men and Provi&s;ions; which it being impo&s;&s;ible for his Maje&s;ty to procure, he &s;ent him Orders to make the be&s;t conditions he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;end$ $$m Orders to make condi|tions</NOTE> could; which he &s;hortly after did; and came him&s;elf to <HI>Paris,</HI> to give the King a larger information of all that had pa&s;&s;ed in that Affair; and after|wards remain'd in <HI>France</HI> under many mortifications, by the power and pro&s;ecution of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> till the King's happy Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>ALL the Foreign Plantations had &s;ubmitted to the Yoke; and indeed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Foreign Plantations al&s;o were &s;ub|dued</NOTE> without any other damage or inconvenience, than the having Citizens and inferior Per&s;ons put to govern them, in&s;tead of Gentlemen, who had been entru&s;ted by the King in tho&s;e places. <HI>New-England</HI> had been too much <MILESTONE N="30"> allied to all the con&s;piracies and combinations again&s;t the Crown, not to be very well plea&s;ed that Men of their own Principles prevail'd; and &s;ettled a Government them&s;elves were delighted with. The <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Barbadoes <HI>deliver'd up</HI></NOTE> which was much the riche&s;t Plantation, was principally inhabited by Men who had retired thither only to be quiet, and to be free from the noi&s;e and oppre&s;&s;ions in <HI>England,</HI> and without any ill thoughts towards the King; many of them having &s;erv'd him with fidelity and courage, during the War; and, that being ended, made that <HI>I&s;land</HI> their Refuge from farther pro&s;ecutions. But having now gotten good E&s;tates there (as it is incredi|ble to what fortunes Men rai&s;ed them&s;elves in few years, in that Planta|tion) <MILESTONE N="40"> they were more willing to live in &s;ubjection to that Government at that di&s;tance, than to return into <HI>England,</HI> and be liable to the penalties of their former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; which, upon the Articles of &s;urrender, they were indemnified for: Nor was there any other alteration there, than the removing the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham</HI> (who was, upon many Ac|counts, odious to the Parliament, as well as by being Governour there by the King's Commi&s;&s;ion) and putting an inferior mean Man in his place.</P>
<P>MORE was expected from <HI>Virginia;</HI> which was the mo&s;t Ancient Plan|tation; and &s;o was thought to be better provided to defend it &s;elf, and to be better affected. Upon both which &s;uppo&s;itions, and out of confidence in S^$ <HI>William Berkley,</HI> the Governour thereof, who had indu&s;triou&s;ly invited many Gentlemen, and others, thither as to a place of &s;ecurity, which he could defend again&s;t any attempt, and where they might live plentifully, many Per&s;ons of condition, and good Officers in the War, had tran&s;ported
<PB N="362" REF="3780">
them&s;elves, with all the E&s;tate they had been able to pre&s;erve; with which the hone&s;t Governour, for no Man meant better, was &s;o confirm'd in his confidence, that he writ to the King almo&s;t inviting him thither, as to a place that wanted nothing. And the truth is, that, whil&s;t the Parliament had nothing el&s;e to do, that Plantation in a &s;hort time was more improv'd in People and Stock, than it had been from the beginning to that time, and had reduced the <HI>Indians</HI> to very good Neighbourhood. But, alas! they were &s;o far from being in a condition to defend them&s;elves, all their indu&s;try having been imploy'd in the making the be&s;t Advantage of their particular Plantations, without a&s;&s;igning time or Men to provide for the publick &s;ecurity in building Forts, or any places of retreat, that there no <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ooner appear'd two or three Ships from the Parliament, than all thoughts <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Virginia.</NOTE> of re&s;i&s;tance were laid a&s;ide. S^r <HI>William Berkley,</HI> the Governour, was &s;uffer'd to remain there as a Private Man, upon his own Plantation; which was a better &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than he could have found any where el&s;e. And in that quiet po&s;ture he continued, by the reputation he had with the People, till upon the noi&s;e and fame of the King's Re&s;toration, he did as quietly re&s;ume the Exerci&s;e of his former Commi&s;&s;ion, and found as ready an obedience. About this time al&s;o, <HI>Scilly,</HI> which had been vigorou&s;ly de|fended by S^r <HI>John Greenville,</HI> till it wanted all things, was deliver'd up to <MILESTONE N="20"> S^r <HI>George Ay&s;cue.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hall not in this place enlarge upon the Affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> (which will be part of the Argument of the next Book) where <HI>Monk</HI> for the pre|&s;ent govern'd with a Rod of Iron, and at la&s;t found no contradiction, or oppo&s;ition to his good Will and Plea&s;ure. In <HI>Ireland,</HI> if that People had not been prepar'd and ripe for de&s;truction, there had happen'd an altera|tion which might have given &s;ome re&s;pite to it, and di&s;po&s;ed the Nation to have united them&s;elves under their new Deputy, whom they had them|&s;elves de&s;ired, under all the &s;olemn obligations of obedience. Shortly after the departure of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond, Cromwell</HI>'s Deputy, <HI>Ireton,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ireton <HI>died in</HI> Limrick <HI>of the Plague</HI></NOTE> had married his Daughter, died in <HI>Limrick</HI> of the Plague; which was gotten into his Army, that was &s;o much weaken'd by it, and there were &s;o great Factions and Divi&s;ions among the Officers after his &s;uddain death, that great Advantages might have been gotten by it. His Authority was &s;o ab&s;olute, that he was entirely &s;ubmitted to in all the Civil, as well as Martial Affairs. But his death was thought &s;o little po&s;&s;ible, that no pro|vi&s;ion had been made for that contingency. So that no Man had Authority to take the Command upon him, till <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s plea&s;ure was farther known; who put the Charge of the Army under <HI>Ludlow,</HI> a Man of a very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ludlow <HI>&s;uc|ceeds him in the Charge of the Army&punc;</HI></NOTE> different temper from the other; but appointed the Civil Government to <MILESTONE N="40"> run in another chanel, &s;o that there remain'd jealou&s;y and di&s;content enough &s;till between the Council and the Officers to have &s;haken a Govern|ment that was yet no better e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>IRETON, of whom we have had too much occa&s;ion to &s;peak formerly, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cha$a$$$r of</HI> Ireton.</NOTE> was of a melancholick, re&s;erv'd, dark Nature, who communicated his thoughts to very few; &s;o that, for the mo&s;t part, he re&s;olv'd alone, but was never diverted from any re&s;olution he had taken; and he was thought often by his ob&s;tinacy to prevail over <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf, and to extort his concurrence contrary to his own inclinations. But that proceeded only from his di&s;&s;embling le&s;s; for he was never re&s;erv'd in the owning and <MILESTONE N="50"> communicating his wor&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous purpo&s;es; which the other allways conceal$d and di&s;avow'd. Hitherto their concurrence had been very natural, &s;ince they had the &s;ame ends and de&s;igns. It was generally conceiv'd by tho&s;e who had the opportunity to know them both very well,
<PB N="363" REF="3790">
that <HI>Ireton</HI> was a Man &s;o radically aver&s;e from Monarchy, and &s;o fixt to a Republick Government, that, if he had liv'd, he would either, by his coun&s;el and credit, have prevented tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es in <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or publick|ly oppo&s;ed and declared again&s;t them, and carried the greate&s;t part of the Army with him; and that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who be&s;t knew his nature, and his temper, had therefore carried him into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and left him there, that he might be without his coun&s;els or importunities, when he &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to put off his Mask, and to act that part which he fore&s;aw it would be requi&s;ite to do. Others thought, his parts lay more towards Civil Affairs; and were fitter for the modelling that Government, which <MILESTONE N="10"> his heart was &s;et upon (being a Scholar, conver&s;ant in the Law, and in all tho&s;e Authors who had expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t animo&s;ity and malice again&s;t the Regal Government) than for the conduct of an Army to &s;upport it; his Per&s;onal Courage being never reckon'd among his other Abilities.</P>
<P>WHAT Influence &s;oever his Life might have had upon the future tran&s;actions, certain it is, his Death had none upon the State of <HI>Ireland</HI> to the King's Advantage. The Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard</HI> left no way unat|tempted <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The $Word$ $ond$|tion of the Marquis $$</HI> $Span$</NOTE> that might apply the vi&s;ible &s;trength, and power of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Na|tion, to the pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves, and to the &s;upport of the King's Government. He &s;ent out his Orders and Warrants for the Levying of <MILESTONE N="20"> new Men, and to draw the old Troops together, and to rai&s;e Money: but few Men could be got together, and when they were A&s;&s;embled, they could not &s;tay together for want of Money to pay them: &s;o that he could never get a Body together to march towards the Enemy; and if he did prevail with them to march a whole day with him, he found, the next morning, that half of them were run away. And it quickly appear'd, that they had made tho&s;e ample Vows and Prote&s;tations, that they might be rid of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> without any purpo&s;e of obeying the other. The greate&s;t part of the Popi&s;h Clergy, and all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> of <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> had no mind to have any relation to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and as little to return to <MILESTONE N="30"> their obedience to the Crown. They blamed each other for having de|&s;erted the Nuntio, and thought of nothing but how they might get &s;ome Foreign Prince to take them into his Protection. They fir&s;t cho&s;e a Com|mittee, <HI>Plunket</HI> and <HI>Brown,</HI> two Lawyers, who had been eminent Con|ductors of the Rebellion from the beginning, and Men of good parts, and joyn'd others with them, who were in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders.</HI> <Q>Then they moved the Lord Deputy, to &s;end the&s;e Gentlemen into <HI>Flanders,</HI> &startq;to in|vite the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with Armes, Money, and Am|munition, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Span$</NOTE> undertaking to have good Intelligence from thence, that the Duke (who was known to wi&s;h well to the King) was well prepared to <MILESTONE N="40"> receive their de&s;ire, and re&s;olv'd, out of his Affection to the King, to en|gage him&s;elf cordially in the defence of that Catholick Kingdom, his&endq; Zeal to that Religion being known to be very great.</Q></P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard</HI> had no opinion of the Expedient, or that the Duke would engage him&s;elf on the behalf of a People who had &s;o little reputation in the world; and therefore refu&s;ed to give any Commi&s;|&s;ion to tho&s;e Gentlemen, or to any other to that purpo&s;e, without fir&s;t re|ceiving the King's Order, or at lea&s;t the advice of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who was known to be &s;afely arriv'd in <HI>France.</HI> But that was look'd upon as delay, which their condition could not bear, and the doubting the truth <MILESTONE N="50"> of the intelligence, and information of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI>'s being will|ing to undertake their Relief, was imputed to want of good will to receive it.

equal malice and virulency, again&s;t the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard;</HI> <Q>and they declared, &startq;that God would never ble&s;s his wither'd hand, which had all|ways concurr'd with <HI>Ormond</HI> in the pro&s;ecution, and per&s;ecution of the Catholicks Confederates from the beginning of their Engagement for the defence of their Religion; and that he had &s;till had more conver&s;a|tion with Hereticks than with Catholicks: that he had refu&s;ed allways to &s;ubmit to the Pope's Authority; and had treated his Nuntio with le&s;s re&s;pect than was due from any good Catholick; and that all the Catho|licks who were cheri&s;hed or countenanced by him, were of the &s;ame&endq; Faction.</Q> In the end, he could not longer re&s;i&s;t the importunity of the A&s;&s;embly of the Confederate Catholicks (which was again brought toge|ther) <MILESTONE N="10"> and of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy that govern'd the other; but gave his con&s;ent to &s;end the &s;ame Per&s;ons they recommended to him; and gave them his Credentials to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> <Q>but required them &startq;pun|ctually to ob&s;erve his own In&s;tructions, and not to pre&s;ume to depart&endq; from them in the lea&s;t degree.</Q> <Q>Their In&s;tructions were, &startq;to give the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> notice of their Arrival; and to &s;hew him their In|&s;tructions;&endq;</Q> and to conclude nothing without his po&s;itive Advice; who, he well knew, would communicate all with the Queen; <Q>and that like|wi&s;e, &startq;when they came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> they &s;hould advi&s;e with &s;uch of <MILESTONE N="20"> the King's Council as &s;hould be there, and proceed in all things as they&endq; &s;hould direct.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT In&s;tructions &s;oever the Lord Deputy pre&s;cribed to them, the Commi&s;&s;ioners receiv'd others from the Council and A&s;&s;embly of their Clergy, which they thought more to the purpo&s;e, and re&s;olv'd to follow; by which they were authorized to yield to any conditions which might prevail with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> to take them into his Protection, and to engage him in their defence, even by delivering all they had of the Kingdom into his hands. Though they landed in <HI>France,</HI> they gave no notice of their bu&s;ine&s;s or their arrival to the Queen, or to the Marquis of <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Ormond;</HI> but pro&s;ecuted their journey to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and made their Ad|dre&s;s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent to him to</HI> Bru&s;&s;els.</NOTE> with all &s;ecrecy, to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine.</HI> There were, at the &s;ame time, at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> the Chancellor of the Ex|chequer (who was newly return'd from his Emba&s;&s;y in <HI>Spain)</HI> and Secre|tary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> all three had been of the King's Council; to neither of whom they &s;o much as gave a vi&s;it. And though the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> during this time, pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> in his journey to <HI>Paris;</HI> they imparted not their Negotiations to his Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> had a very good mind to get footing in <HI>Ire|land;</HI> where, he was &s;ure, there wanted no Men to make Armies enough, <MILESTONE N="40"> which he thought were not like to want Courage to defend their Country and Religion. <Q>And the Commi&s;&s;ioners very frankly offer'd &startq;to deliver up <HI>Galloway,</HI> and all the places which were in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, into his hands, with the remainder of the Kingdom, a&s;&s;oon as it could be re|duced;&endq;</Q> and to obey him ab&s;olutely as their Prince. But he, as a re&s;erve to decline the whole, if it appear'd to be a de&s;ign fuller of difficulty than he then apprehended, di&s;cover'd much of his Affection to the King, <Q>and his re&s;olution &startq;not to accept any thing that was propo&s;ed, without his&endq; Maje&s;ty's privity and full approbation.</Q> But in the mean time, and till that might be procured, he was content to &s;end the Abbot of S^$ <HI>Cathe|rine</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke &s;ends an Ab|bot into</HI> Ire|land <HI>to be in|form'd of the State of it.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> a <HI>Lorrainer,</HI> and a Per&s;on principally tru&s;ted by him, as his Emba&s;&s;a|dour into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be inform'd of the true State of that Kingdom, and what real &s;trength the Confederate Catholicks were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and at what Unity among them&s;elves.

The Duke writ to the Lord Deputy the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> as the King's Governour, and the Per&s;on by who&s;e Autho|rity all tho&s;e Propo&s;itions had been made to him by the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>THE Abbot upon his Arrival (though he was civilly receiv'd) quickly found, that the Marquis knew nothing of what the Commi&s;&s;ioners had propo&s;ed or offer'd; and would by no means, &s;o much as enter upon any Treaty with him; <Q>but di&s;avow'd all that they had &s;aid or done, with much vehemence, and with a Prote&s;tation, &startq;that he would cau&s;e their&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marquis renounces any con&s;ent to the Treaty.</NOTE> heads to be cut off, if they return'd, or came into his hands.</Q> And the <MILESTONE N="10"> Marquis did, at the &s;ame time, write very large Letters both to the King, and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> of their pre&s;umption and wicked|ne&s;s; <Q>and very earne&s;tly de&s;ired, &startq;that they might be impri&s;on'd, and&endq; kept till they might undergo a ju&s;t Tryal.</Q></P>
<P>AS the Marquis expre&s;&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible indignation, &s;o many of the Ca|tholick Nobility, and even &s;ome of their Clergy, who never intended to withdraw their Loyalty from the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> how weakly &s;oever they had manife&s;ted it, indeed all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation, but tho&s;e of <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> who were of the old Septs, were wonderfully &s;candalized to find that all their &s;trength was to be deliver'd pre&s;ently up into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Foreign Prince; upon who&s;e good nature only, it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed that <MILESTONE N="20"> he would hereafter re&s;tore it to the King. It was now time for the Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops, and their Confederates, to make good what had been offer'd by the Commi&s;&s;ioners with their Authority; which though they thought not &s;it to own, they u&s;ed all their endeavours now in procuring to have it con&s;ented to, and ratified. <Q>They very importunately advi&s;ed, and pre&s;&s;ed the Lord Deputy, &startq;to confirm what had been offer'd, as the only vi&s;ible means to pre&s;erve the Nation, and a Root out of which the King's Right&endq; might again &s;pring and grow up:</Q> and when they found, that he was &s;o far from yielding to what they de&s;ired, that, if he had power, he would proceed again&s;t them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity for what they had done, <MILESTONE N="30"> that he would no more give Audience to the Emba&s;&s;adour, and remov'd from the place where they were, to his own Hou&s;e and Ca&s;tle at <HI>Portumny,</HI> to be &s;ecure from their importunity or violence, they barefaced own'd all that the Commi&s;&s;ioners had propounded, <Q>&startq;as done by their Order, who&endq; could make it good;</Q> <Q>and de&s;ired the Emba&s;&s;adour &startq;to enter into a Trea|ty&endq; with them;</Q> <Q>and declared &startq;that they would &s;ign &s;uch Articles, with&endq; which the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> &s;hould be well &s;atisfied.</Q> They undervalued the power of the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> as not able to oppo&s;e any agree|ment they &s;hould make, nor able to make good any thing he &s;hould pro|mi&s;e him&s;elf, without Their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THE Emba&s;&s;adour was a wi&s;e Man, and of flegme enough; and though he heard all they would &s;ay, and receiv'd any Propo&s;itions they would give him in writing, yet he quickly di&s;cern'd, that they were &s;o unskilful as to the managery of any great de&s;ign, and &s;o disjoynted among them&s;elves, that they could not be depended upon to any purpo&s;e; and excu&s;ed him|&s;elf from entring upon any new Treaty with them, as having no Commi&s;|&s;ion to treat but with the Lord Deputy. <Q>But he told them, &startq;he would de|liver all that they had, or would propo&s;e to him, to the Duke his Ma&s;ter; who, he pre&s;um'd, would &s;peedily return his An&s;wer, and proceed with&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> their Commi&s;&s;ioners in &s;uch a manner as would be grateful to them.</Q> So <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Abb$$ $$ turns to the Duke, where|upon the Duke gi$ues over the Negotiat$on&punc;</NOTE> he return'd in the &s;ame Ship that brought him, and gave the Duke &s;uch an Account of his Voyage, and that People, that put an end to that Negotiation; which had been enter'd into, and pro&s;ecuted, with le&s;s
<PB N="366" REF="3820">
warine&s;s, circum&s;pection, and good husbandry, than that Prince was ac|cu&s;tom'd to u&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN the Emba&s;&s;adour was gone, they pro&s;ecuted the Deputy, with all Reproaches of betraying and ruining his Country; and had &s;everal de|&s;igns upon his Per&s;on, and communicated whatever Attempt was re&s;olv'd to the Enemy: yet there were many of the Nobility and Gentry that con|tinued firm, and adhered to him very faithfully; which defended his Per&s;on from any Violence they intended again&s;t him, but could not &s;ecure him again&s;t their Acts of Treachery, nor keep his Coun&s;els from being betray'd. After the Defeat of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> was known and publi&s;h'd, they le&s;s con&s;ider'd all they did; and every one thought he was to provide for his own &s;ecurity <MILESTONE N="10"> that way that &s;eem'd mo&s;t probable to him; <Q>and who&s;oever was mo&s;t in|tent upon that, put on a new face, and application to the Deputy, and loud|ly urged &startq;the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting them&s;elves for the publick &s;afety, which&endq; was de&s;perate any other way:</Q> whil&s;t in truth every Man was negotiating for his own indemnity with <HI>Ludlow</HI> (who commanded the <HI>Engli&s;h)</HI> or for leave to tran&s;port Regiments; which kept the Soldiers together, as if they had been the Deputy's Army.</P>
<P>THE Deputy had a &s;u&s;picion of a fellow, who was ob&s;erv'd every day to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Clanrickard <HI>di&s;covers a corre&s;pondence managed by a Fryar between the Popi&s;h</HI> Ii&s;h <HI>Clergy and</HI> Ludlow.</NOTE> go out, and return'd not till the next; and appointed an Officer of tru&s;t, with &s;ome Hor&s;e, to watch him, and &s;earch him; which they did; and <MILESTONE N="20"> found about him a Letter, which contain'd many Reproaches again&s;t the Marquis, and the Intelligence of many particulars; which the Me&s;&s;enger was carrying to <HI>Ludlow.</HI> It was quickly di&s;cover'd that the Letter was written by one Father <HI>Cohogan,</HI> a Franci&s;can Fryar in <HI>Galloway;</HI> where the Deputy then was; but much of the Intelligence was &s;uch as could not be known by him, but mu&s;t come from &s;ome who were in the mo&s;t pri|vate con&s;ultations. The Deputy cau&s;ed the Fryar to be impri&s;on'd, and re&s;olv'd to proceed exemplarily again&s;t him, after he had fir&s;t di&s;cover'd his Complices. The Fryar confe&s;&s;ed the Letter to be of his writing, but <MILESTONE N="30"> refu&s;ed to an&s;wer to any other Que&s;tion; and demanded his Privilege of a Church-Man, and not to be tried by the Deputy's Order. <Q>The Conclu&s;ion was, the Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops cau&s;ed him to be taken out of the Pri&s;on; and &s;ent to the Deputy, &startq;that if he would &s;end to them his Evidence again&s;t the Fryar, who was an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;on, they would take care that&endq; ju&s;tice &s;hould be done.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Proceeding convinced the Deputy, that he &s;hould not be able to do the King any &s;ervice in that Company; nor dur&s;t he &s;tay longer in that Town, le&s;t they &s;hould make their own Peace by delivering up him and the Town together; which they would have made no &s;cruple to have done <MILESTONE N="40"> From that time he remov'd from place to place, not daring to lodge twice in the &s;ame place together, le&s;t he &s;hould be betray'd; and &s;ometimes without any Accommodations: &s;o that, not having been accu&s;tom'd to tho&s;e hard&s;hips, he contracted tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which he could never reco|ver. In this manner he continued till he receiv'd Commands from the King. For a&s;&s;oon as he had adverti&s;ement of the King's Arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> and it was very evident by the behaviour of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> that they would be no more applied to the King's Service under His Command than under the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s, he &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;tle-haven</HI> (who had been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He &s;ends the Earl of</HI> Ca&s;tle|haven <HI>to give an account of all to the King</HI></NOTE> formerly a General of the Confederate Catholicks, and remain'd with great <MILESTONE N="50"> con&s;tancy with the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> as long as there was any hope) to the King, with &s;o particular an account, under his own hand of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, from the time that he had receiv'd his Commi&s;&s;ion from the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> that it even contain'd almo&s;t a Diary, in which he
<PB N="367" REF="3830">
made &s;o lively a de&s;cription of the proceedings of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> of their Over|tures to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and of their &s;everal tergiver&s;ations and treacheries towards him, that any Man might di&s;cern, e&s;pecially they who knew the genero&s;ity of the Marquis, his Nature, and his cu&s;tom of having, that he had &s;ubmitted to a life very uncomfortable and melan|cholick; and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty's leave that he might retire, and procure a Pa&s;s to go into <HI>England;</HI> where he had &s;ome E&s;tate of his own, and ma|ny Friends, who would not &s;uffer him to &s;tarve; which his Maje&s;ty made <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;ends $Word$ leave to $Word$</NOTE> ha&s;t to &s;end to him, with as great a Te&s;timony of his gracious Acceptation of his Service, and Affection, as his &s;ingular merit de&s;erv'd. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>

But by the Infirmi|ties he had contracted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by tho&s;e &s;evere fatigues and di&s;tre&s;&s;es he had been expo&s;ed to, he liv'd not to the end of a year; and had re&s;olv'd, upon the recovery of any degree of health, to have tran&s;ported him&s;elf to the King, and attended his fortune. He left behind him &s;o full a Relation of all material pa&s;&s;ages, as well from the beginning of that Rebellion, as <MILESTONE N="20"> during the time of his own Admini&s;tration, that I have been the le&s;s par|ticular in the Accounts of what pa&s;&s;ed in the tran&s;actions of that King|dom, pre&s;uming that more exact work of His will, in due time, be com|municated to the World.</P>

<P>_HAD not God re&s;erv'd the Deliverance and Re|&s;toration of the King to Him&s;elf, and re&s;olv'd to accompli&s;h it when there appear'd lea&s;t hope of it, and lea&s;t worldly means to bring it to pa&s;s; there happen'd at this time another very great Alteration in <HI>England,</HI> that, together with the continuance of the War with <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and Affronts every day offer'd to <HI>France,</HI> might very rea&s;onably have admini&s;ter'd great hopes to the King of a &s;peedy change of Go|vernment <MILESTONE N="10"> there. From the time of the defeat at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and the re|duction of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to perfect obedience, <HI>Cromwell</HI> did not find the Parliament &s;o &s;upple to ob&s;erve his Orders, as he expected they would have been. The Presbyterian Party, which he had di&s;counte|nanced all he could, and made his Army of the Independent Party, were bold in contradicting him in the Hou&s;e, and cro&s;&s;ing all his de&s;igns in the City, and exceedingly inveighed again&s;t the $icence that was pra|cticed in Religion, by the &s;everal factions of Independents, Anabapti&s;ts, and the &s;everal Species of the&s;e; who contemn'd all Magi&s;trates, and the Laws e&s;tabli&s;h'd. All the&s;e, how contradictory &s;oever to one an|other, <HI>Cromwell</HI> cheri&s;hed and protected, that he might not be overrun by the Presbyterians; of whom the time was not yet come that he
<PB N="372" REF="3860">
could make u&s;e: yet he &s;eem'd to &s;hew much re&s;pect to &s;ome principal Preachers of that Party; and con&s;ulted much with them, how the di&s;tempers in Religion might be compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THOUGH he had been forward enough to enter upon the War of <HI>Holland,</HI> that &s;o there might be no propo&s;ition made for the disband|ing any part of his Army, which otherwi&s;e could not be prevented, yet he found the expence of it was &s;o great, that the Nation could never bear that addition of burthen to the other of Land Forces; which how apparent &s;oever, he &s;aw the Parliament &s;o fierce for the carrying on that War, that they would not hearken to any rea&s;onable Conditions of Peace; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> appear'd mo&s;t &s;ollicitous to make upon any <MILESTONE N="10"> terms. But that which troubled him mo&s;t, was the jealou&s;y that his own party of Independents, and other Sectaries, had contracted again&s;t him: that Party, that had advanced him to the height he was at, and made him &s;uperior to all oppo&s;ition, even his beloved <HI>Vane,</HI> thought his Power and Authority to be too great for a Common-wealth, and that He, and his Army, had not dependence enough upon, or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Parliament. So that he found tho&s;e who had exalted him, now mo&s;t &s;ollicitous to bring him lower; and he knew well enough what any diminution of his Power and Authority mu&s;t quickly be attended with. He ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e his old Friends very frankly united them|&s;elves <MILESTONE N="20"> with His and Their old Enemies, the Presbyterians, for the pro|&s;ecution of the War with <HI>Holland,</HI> and ob&s;tructing all the Overtures towards Peace; which mu&s;t, in a &s;hort time, exhau&s;t the Stock, and con&s;equently di&s;turb any &s;ettlement in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>IN this perplexity he re&s;orts to his old remedy, his Army; and again <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>erects another Council of Of|ficers; who expo&s;tulate with the Par|liament about their Arrears, and their own Di&s;&s;olution.</HI></NOTE> erects another Council of Officers, who, under the Style, fir&s;t, of Peti|tions, and then, of Remon&s;trances, interpo&s;ed in what&s;oever had any relation to the Army; <Q>u&s;ed great importunity for &startq;the Arrears of their pay; that they might not be compelled to take free Quarter upon their fellow Subjects, who already paid &s;o great Contributions and <MILESTONE N="30"> Taxes; which they were well a&s;&s;ured, if well managed, would abun|dantly&endq; defray all the Charges of the War, and of the Government.</Q> The &s;harp An&s;wers the Parliament gave to their Addre&s;&s;es, and the repre|hen&s;ions for their pre&s;umption in medling with matters above them, gave the Army new matter to reply to; <Q>and put them in mind of &s;ome former profe&s;&s;ions they had made, &startq;that they would be glad to be ea&s;ed of the Burthen of their imployment; and that there might be &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive&endq; Parliaments to undergo the &s;ame trouble They had done.</Q> <Q>They therefore de&s;ired them, &startq;that they would remember how many years they had &s;ate; and though they had done great things, yet it was a <MILESTONE N="40"> great injury to the re&s;t of the Nation, to be utterly excluded from bearing any part in the Service of their Country, by their ingro&s;&s;ing the whole power into Their hands; and thereupon be&s;ought them, that they would &s;ettle a Council for the admini&s;tration of the Govern|ment during the Interval, and then di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves, and Summon&endq; a new Parliament;</Q> <Q>which, they told them, &startq;would be the mo&s;t po|pular&endq; Action they could perform.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Addre&s;&s;es in the Name of the Army, being confidently de|liver'd by &s;ome Officers of it, and as confidently &s;econded by others who were Members of the Hou&s;e, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment debate about the $Span$ of their $it$ing</NOTE> receive a &s;olemn debate, to the end that when the Parliament had de|clared its re&s;olution and determination, all Per&s;ons might be obliged

to acquie&s;ce therein, and &s;o there would be an end put to all Addre&s;&s;es of that kind.</P>
<P>THERE were many Members of the Hou&s;e, who either from the ju&s;tice and rea&s;on of the Reque&s;t, or &s;ea&s;onably to comply with the &s;en&s;e of the Army, to which they fore&s;aw they &s;hould be at la&s;t compelled to &s;ubmit, &s;eem'd to think it nece&s;&s;ary, for abating the great Envy, which was confe&s;&s;edly again&s;t the Parliament throughout the Kingdom, that they &s;hould be di&s;&s;olv'd, to the end the People might make a new Ele|ction of &s;uch Per&s;ons as they thought fit to tru&s;t with their Liberty and Property, and what&s;oever was deare&s;t to them. <Q>But M^r <HI>Martyn</HI> told <NOTE PLACE="marg">Harry Mar+tyn<HI>'s App$$$$|tion of the &s;to|ry of</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>to this purpo&s;e</HI></NOTE> them, &startq;that he thought they might find the be&s;t Advice from the Scri|pture, <MILESTONE N="10"> what they were to do in this particular: that when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was found upon the River, and brought to <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s Daughter, &s;he took care that the Mother might be found out, to who&s;e care he might be committed to be nur&s;ed; which &s;ucceeded very happily. He &s;aid, their Common-wealth was yet an Infant, of a weak growth, and a very tender con&s;titution; and therefore his opinion was, that no body could be &s;o fit to nur&s;e it, as the Mother who brought it forth; and that they &s;hould not think of putting it under any other hands, until it&endq; had obtained more years and vigour.</Q> <Q>To which he added, &startq;that they <MILESTONE N="20"> had another Infant too under their hands, the War with <HI>Holland;</HI> which had thrived wonderfully under Their Conduct; but he much doubted that it would be quickly &s;trangled, if it were taken out of their&endq; care who had hitherto govern'd it.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Rea&s;ons prevailed &s;o far, that, what&s;oever was &s;aid to the contrary, it was determin'd, that the Parliament would not yet think <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment deter|min'd, that they would not yet think of Di&s;&s;olving.</NOTE> of Di&s;&s;olving, nor would take it well, that any Per&s;ons &s;hould take the pre&s;umption any more to make Overtures to them of that Nature, which was not fit for private and particular Per&s;ons to meddle with: and to put a Sea&s;onable &s;top to any farther pre&s;umption of that kind, <MILESTONE N="30"> they appointed a Committee <Q>&startq;&s;peedily to prepare an Act of Parliament for the filling up of their Hou&s;e; and by which, it &s;hould be declared to be High Trea&s;on, for any Man to propo&s;e, or contrive the chang|ing&endq; of the pre&s;ent Government &s;ettled, and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Bill being prepared by the Committee, they re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s it with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. So <HI>Cromwell</HI> clearly di&s;cern'd, that by this means they would never be per&s;waded to part with that Authority and Power, which was &s;o profitable, and &s;o plea&s;ant to them: yet the Army declared they were not &s;atisfied with the Determination, and con|tinued their Applications to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, or to others as unagree|able <MILESTONE N="40"> to the &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e; and did all they could to in&s;u&s;e the &s;ame Spirit into all the parts of the Kingdom, to make the Parliament odious, as it was already very abundantly; and <HI>Cromwell</HI> was well plea&s;ed that the Parliament &s;hould expre&s;s as much prejudice again&s;t the Army.</P>
<P>ALL things being thus prepared, <HI>Cromwell</HI> thought this a good &s;ea|&s;on to expo&s;e the&s;e Enemies of Peace to the indignation of the Nation; which, he knew, was generally weary of the War, and hoped, if that were at an end, that they &s;hould be ea&s;ed of the greate&s;t part of their Contributions, and other Impo&s;itions: thereupon, having adju&s;ted all things with the Chief Officers of the Army, who were at his Devotion, <MILESTONE N="50"> in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> that was in the year 1653, he came into the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>and his Of|ficers $Word$ the Parlia|ment</HI></NOTE> Hou&s;e of Parliament in a morning when it was &s;itting, attended with the Officers, who were likewi&s;e Members of the Hou&s;e, and told them,
<Q><PB N="374" REF="3880">
&startq;that he came thither to put an end to their Power and Authority; which they had managed &s;o ill, that the Nation could be no other|wi&s;e pre&s;erv'd than by their Di&s;&s;olution; which he advi&s;ed them,&endq; without farther Debate, quietly to &s;ubmit unto.</Q></P>
<P>THEREUPON another Officer, with &s;ome Files of Mu&s;queteers, en|ter'd into the Hou&s;e, and &s;tay'd there till all the Members walked out; <HI>Cromwell</HI> reproaching many of the Members by Name, as they went out of the Hou&s;e, with their Vices and Corruptions, and among&s;t the re&s;t, S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> with his breach of Faith and Corruption; and having given the Mace to an Officer to be &s;afely kept, he cau&s;ed the <MILESTONE N="10"> Doors to be lock'd up; and &s;o di&s;&s;olv'd that A&s;&s;embly, which had &s;at al|mo&s;t thirteen years, and under who&s;e Name he had wrought &s;o much mi&s;chief, and reduced three Kingdoms to his own entire obedience and &s;ubjection, without any example or Precedent in the Chri&s;tian World that could rai&s;e his Ambition to &s;uch a pre&s;umptuous Undertaking, and without any rational dependence upon the friend&s;hip of one Man who had any other Intere&s;t to advance his de&s;igns, but what he had given him by preferring him in the War.</P>
<P>WHEN He had thus pro&s;perou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed this <HI>Rubicon,</HI> he lo&s;t no time in publi&s;hing a Declaration of the grounds and rea&s;ons of his Proceeding, <MILESTONE N="20"> for the &s;atisfaction of the People: <Q>in which he put them in mind, &startq;how miraculou&s;ly God had appear'd for them in reducing <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scot|land</HI> to &s;o great a degree of Peace, and <HI>England</HI> to a perfect quiet; whereby the Parliament had opportunity to give the People the har|ve&s;t of all their Labour, Blood, and Trea&s;ure, and to &s;ettle a due Li|berty in reference to Civil and Spiritual things, whereunto they were obliged by their Duty, and tho&s;e great and wonderful things God had wrought for them. But that they had made &s;o little progre&s;s towards this good end, that it was matter of much grief to the good People of the Land, who had thereupon apply'd them&s;elves to the Army, ex|pecting Redre&s;s by their means; who, being very unwilling to med|dle <MILESTONE N="30"> with the Civil Authority, thought fit that &s;ome Officers, who were Members of the Parliament, &s;hould move, and de&s;ire the Par|liament to proceed vigorou&s;ly in reforming what was ami&s;s in the Common-wealth, and in &s;ettling it upon a foundation of Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: that they found this, and &s;ome other Endeavours they had u&s;ed, produced no good effect, but rather an aver&s;ne&s;s to the things them&s;elves, with much bitterne&s;s and aver&s;ion to the People of God, and his Spirit acting in them: in&s;omuch as the Godly Party in the Army was now become of no other U&s;e, than to countenance the <MILESTONE N="40"> ends of a corrupt Party, that de&s;ired to perpetuate them&s;elves in the &s;upreme Government of the Nation: that, for the obviating tho&s;e Evils, the Officers of the Army had obtain'd &s;everal meetings with &s;ome Members of the Parliament, to con&s;ider what remedies might properly be apply'd; but that it appear'd very evident unto them, that the Parliament, by want of Attendance of many of their Mem|bers, and want of Integrity in others who did attend, would never an&s;wer tho&s;e ends, which God, his People, and the whole Nation, ex|pected from them. But that this Cau&s;e, which God had &s;o greatly ble&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t needs langui&s;h under their hands; and by degrees be <MILESTONE N="50"> lo&s;t, and the Lives, Liberties, and Comforts of his People, be deli|ver'd into their Enemies hands. All which being &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;adly con&s;ider'd by the hone&s;t People of the Nation, as well as by the Army,
<PB N="375" REF="3890">
it &s;eem'd a Duty incumbent upon them, who had &s;een &s;o much of the power and pre&s;ence of God, to con&s;ider of &s;ome effectual means, where|by to e&s;tabli&s;h Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace in the&s;e Nations: that, after much Debate, it had been judged nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;upreme Govern|ment &s;hould be, by the Parliament, devolv'd for a time upon known Per&s;ons, fearing God, and of approv'd Integrity, as the mo&s;t hopeful way to countenance all God's People, pre&s;erve the Law, and admini|&s;ter Ju&s;tice impartially; hoping thereby, that People might forget Monarchy, and under&s;tand their true Intere&s;t in the election of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Parliaments, and &s;o the Government might be &s;ettled upon a right ba&s;is, without hazard to this glorious Cau&s;e, or nece&s;&s;ity to keep <MILESTONE N="10"> up Armies for the defence thereof: that being re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to decline all extraordinary Cour&s;es, they had prevailed with about twen|ty Members of the Parliament to give them a conference; with whom they debated the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of that Propo&s;ition; but found them of &s;o contrary an opinion, that they in&s;i&s;ted upon the continuance of the pre&s;ent Parliament, as it was then con&s;tituted, as the only way to bring tho&s;e good things to pa&s;s which they &s;eem'd to de&s;ire: that they in&s;i&s;ted upon this with &s;o much vehemence, and were &s;o much tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion, that they cau&s;ed a Bill to be prepared for the <MILESTONE N="20"> perpetuating this Parliament, and inve&s;ting the &s;upreme power in them&s;elves. And for the preventing the con&s;ummation of this Act, and all the &s;ad and evil con&s;equences, which, upon the grounds thereof, mu&s;t have en&s;ued, and whereby, at one blow, the Intere&s;t of all ho|ne&s;t Men, and of this glorious Cau&s;e, had been in danger to be laid in the du&s;t, they had been nece&s;&s;itated (though with much repugnance)&endq; to put an end to the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THERE needs not be any other de&s;cription of the temper of the Na|tion at that time, than the remembring that the di&s;&s;olution of that Body of Men, who had reign'd &s;o long over the three Nations, was gene|rally very grateful and acceptable to the People, how unu&s;ual &s;oever <MILESTONE N="30"> the circum&s;tances thereof had been; and that this Declaration, which was not only &s;ub&s;crib'd by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Council of Officers, but was own'd by the Admirals at Sea, and all the Captains of Ships, and by the Commanders of all the Land Forces in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> was look'd upon as very rea&s;onable; and the Declaration, that i&s;&s;ued thereupon, by which the People were required to live peacea|bly, and quietly to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Government of the Coun|cil of State, which &s;hould be nominated by the General, until &s;uch a time as a Parliament, con&s;i&s;ting of Per&s;ons of approv'd fidelity and ho|ne&s;ty, <MILESTONE N="40"> could meet, and take upon them the Government of tho&s;e Na|tions, found an equal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and obedience.</P>
<P>THE Method he pur&s;ued afterwards, for the compo&s;ing a Govern|ment, by fir&s;t putting it into a mo&s;t ridiculous Confu&s;ion, and by de|ve&s;ting him&s;elf of all pretences to Authority, and putting what he had no title to keep into the hands of Men &s;o well cho&s;en, that they &s;hould &s;hortly after delegate the power in form of Law to him for the pre|&s;ervation of the Nation, was not le&s;s admirable; <Q>and puts me in mind of what <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Pompey,</HI> &startq;that he had brought the People of <HI>Rome</HI> to that pa&s;s, by magnifying their power and authority, <HI>ut &s;alvus e&s;&s;e&endq;</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>non po&s;&s;it ni&s;i beneficio &s;ervitutis.</HI></Q> And if <HI>Cromwell</HI> had not now made him&s;elf a Tyrant, all Bonds being broken, and the univer&s;al Guilt diverting all inclinations to return to the King's obedience, they mu&s;t
<PB N="376" REF="3900">
have peri&s;h'd together in &s;uch a confu&s;ion, as would rather have ex|po&s;ed them as a Prey to Foreigners, than di&s;po&s;ed them to the only rea|&s;onable way for their pre&s;ervation; there being no Man that dur&s;t men|tion the King, or the old form of Government.</P>
<P>IT was upon the twentieth of <HI>April</HI> that the Parliament had been di&s;&s;olv'd; and though <HI>Cromwell</HI> found that the People were &s;atis|fied in it, and the Declaration publi&s;h'd thereupon, yet he knew, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to provide &s;ome other vi&s;ible power to &s;ettle the Go|vernment, than the Council of Officers; all whom he was not &s;ure he &s;hould be able long entirely to govern, many of them having clear other Notions of a Republick than he was willing <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be <MILESTONE N="10"> brought to. A Parliament was &s;till a name of more veneration than any other A&s;&s;embly of Men was like to be, and the contempt the la&s;t was fallen into, was like to teach the next to behave it &s;elf with more di&s;|cretion. However the Ice was broken for di&s;&s;olving them, when they &s;hould do otherwi&s;e; yet he was not &s;o well &s;atisfied in the general temper, as to tru&s;t the Election of them to the humour and inclination of the People.</P>
<P>HE re&s;olv'd therefore to choo&s;e them him&s;elf, that he might with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>and his Of|ficers choo&s;e a Parliament.</HI></NOTE> the more Ju&s;tice unmake them when he &s;hould think fit; and with <MILESTONE N="20"> the Advice of his Council of Officers, for he made yet no other Council of State, he made choice of a number of Men con&s;i&s;ting of above one hundred Per&s;ons, who &s;hould meet as a Parliament to &s;ettle the Go|vernment of the Nation. It can hardly be believ'd that &s;o wild a No|tion &s;hould fall into any Man's imagination, that &s;uch a People &s;hould be fit to contribute towards any &s;ettlement, or that from their Actions any thing could re&s;ult, that might advance his particular de&s;ign. <Q>Yet upon the view and con&s;ideration of the Per&s;ons made choice of, many did conclude, &startq;that he had made his own &s;cheme entirely to him&s;elf; and though he communicated it with no Man that was known, con|cluded <MILESTONE N="30"> it the mo&s;t natural way to ripen, and produce the Effects, it did&endq; afterwards, to the end he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>THERE were among&s;t them divers of the Quality and degree of Gen|tlemen, and who had E&s;tates, and &s;uch a proportion of credit and re|putation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conditions and Qualities of the Per&s;ons nominated.</NOTE> as could con&s;i&s;t with the guilt they had contracted. But much the Major part of them con&s;i&s;ted of inferior Per&s;ons, of no Quality, or Name, Artificers of the meane&s;t Trades, known only by their gifts in Praying and Preaching; which was now practi&s;ed by all degrees of Men, but Scholars, throughout the Kingdom. In which number, that there may be a better judgement made of the re&s;t, it will not be ami&s;s to <MILESTONE N="40"> name one, from whom that Parliament it &s;elf was afterwards denomi|nated, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>From one of the Members, this was $$$$|named</HI> Pra$$e-God But $one<HI>'s Par|$Span$</HI></NOTE> who was <HI>Prai&s;e-God</HI> (that was his Chri&s;tian Name) <HI>Barebone,</HI> a Leather-&s;eller in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> from whom (he being an eminent Speaker in it) it was afterwards call'd <HI>Prai&s;e-God Barebone</HI>'s Parliament. In a word they were generally a pack of weak &s;en&s;ele&s;s Fellows, fit only to bring the Name, and Reputation of Parliaments, lower than it was yet.</P>
<P>IT was fit the&s;e new Men &s;hould be brought together by &s;ome new way: and a very new way it was; <Q>for <HI>Cromwell</HI> by his Warrants, di|rected <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>$Span$ Warrant t$ meet</HI> July 4</NOTE> to every one of them, telling them &startq;of the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;olving the late Parliament, and of an equal nece&s;&s;ity, that the Peace, Safety, <MILESTONE N="50"> and good Government of the Common-wealth &s;hould be provided for, and therefore that he had, by the Advice of his Council of Officers, nominated divers Per&s;ons fearing God, and of approv'd fidelity and

<P><Q>CROMWELL with his Council of Officers was ready to receive them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>&s;peaks to them, and delivers them an In|&s;trument for their Autho|rity</HI></NOTE> and made them a long di&s;cour&s;e of &startq;the fear of God, and the honour&endq; due to his Name, full of Texts of Scripture;</Q> <Q>and remember'd &startq;the wonderful Mercies of God to this Nation, and the continued Series of Providence, by which he had appear'd in carrying on his Cau&s;e, and bringing Affairs into that pre&s;ent glorious condition, wherein they&endq; now were.</Q> <Q>He put them in mind of &startq;the noble Actions of the Army <MILESTONE N="20"> in the famous Victory of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> of the Applications they had made to the Parliament, for a good &s;ettlement of all the Affairs of the Com|mon-wealth, the neglect whereof made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;|&s;olve&endq; it.</Q> <Q>He a&s;&s;ured them by many Arguments, &s;ome of which were urged out of Scripture, &startq;that they had a very lawful Call to take upon&endq; them the &s;upreme Authority of the Nation, and concluded with a very earne&s;t de&s;ire,</Q> <Q>&startq;that great tenderne&s;s might be u&s;ed towards all con&s;cientious Per&s;ons, of what judgement &s;oever they appear'd&endq; to be.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN he had fini&s;h'd his di&s;cour&s;e, he deliver'd to them an In&s;tru|ment <MILESTONE N="30"> engro&s;&s;ed in Parchment under his hand and &s;eal, whereby, with the advice of his Council of Officers, he did devolve, and intru&s;t the &s;upreme Authority of this Common-wealth into the hands of tho&s;e Per|&s;ons therein mention'd, and declared, <Q>&startq;that they, or any forty of them were to be held and acknowledged the &s;upreme Authority of the Na|tion, to which all Per&s;ons within the &s;ame, and the Territories there|unto belonging, were to yield obedience and &s;ubjection to the third&endq; day of the Month of <HI>November,</HI></Q> which &s;hould be in the Year 1654, which was about a Year and three Months from the time that he &s;poke to them; and three Months before the time pre&s;crib'd &s;hould expire, <MILESTONE N="40"> they were to make choice of other Per&s;ons to &s;ucceed them, who&s;e Power and Authority &s;hould not exceed one Year, and then They were like|wi&s;e to provide, and take care for a like &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Government.

<P>AT their fir&s;t coming together, &s;ome of them had the mode&s;ty to doubt, that they were not, in many re&s;pects, &s;o well qualified as to take upon them the Style and Title of a Parliament. But that mode&s;ty
<PB N="378" REF="3920">
was quickly &s;ubdued, and they were ea&s;ily per&s;waded to a&s;&s;ume that <NOTE PLACE="marg">They a&s;&s;ume the Name of a Parliament&punc;</NOTE> Title, and to con&s;ider them&s;elves as the &s;upreme Authority in the Na|tion. The&s;e Men thus brought together continued in this Capacity near &s;ix Months to the amazement, and even mirth of the People. In which time they never enter'd upon any grave and &s;erious Debate, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Actings and Con&s;ulta|tions</NOTE> might tend to any &s;ettlement, but generally expre&s;&s;ed great &s;harpne&s;s, and animo&s;ity again&s;t the Clergy, and again&s;t all Learning, out of which they thought the Clergy had grown, and &s;till would grow.</P>
<P>THERE were now no Bi&s;hops for them to be angry with; they had already reduced all that Order to the lowe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. But their quarrel <MILESTONE N="10"> was again&s;t all who had called them&s;elves Mini&s;ters, and who, by be|ing called &s;o, receiv'd Tythes, and re&s;pect from their Neighbours. They looked upon the function it &s;elf to be Anti-Chri&s;tian, and the Per&s;ons to be burthen&s;ome to the People, and the requiring, and payment of Tythes to be ab&s;olute Judai&s;m, and they thought fit that they &s;hould be aboli&s;hed altogether; <Q>and that there might not for the time to come be any race of People who might revive tho&s;e pretences, they propo&s;ed &startq;that all Lands belonging to the Univer&s;ities, and Colleges in tho&s;e Univer&s;ities, might be &s;old, and the Monies that &s;hould ari&s;e thereby, be di&s;po&s;ed for the publick Service, and to ea&s;e the People from the&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> payment of Taxes and Contributions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN they had tired and perplexed them&s;elves &s;o long in &s;uch De|bates, a&s;&s;oon as they were met in the morning upon the twelfth of <HI>De|cember,</HI> and before many of them were come who were like to di&s;&s;ent from the Motion, one of them &s;tood up and declared, &startq;that he did be|lieve, they were not equal to the Burthen that was laid upon them, and therefore that they might di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves, and deliver back&endq; their Authority into Their hands from whom they had receiv'd it;</Q> which being pre&s;ently con&s;ented to, their Speaker, with tho&s;e who were of that mind, went to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and redeliver'd to <HI>Crom|well</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> the In&s;trument they had receiv'd from him, acknowledged their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>On the</HI> 12 <HI>of</HI> December <HI>they deliver'd up their power to</HI> Cromwell.</NOTE> own Impotency, and be&s;ought him to take care of the Common|wealth.</P>
<P>BY this frank Donation He and his Council of Officers were once more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Supreme Soveraign Power of the Nation. And in few days after, his Council were too mode&s;t to &s;hare with him in this Royal Authority, but declared, <Q>&startq;that the Government of the Common|wealth &s;hould re&s;ide in a &s;ingle Per&s;on; that that Per&s;on &s;hould be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>and his Council of Officers make him Lord Pro|tector</HI></NOTE> <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> Captain General of all the Forces in <HI>England, Scot|land,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that his Title &s;hould be <HI>Lord Protector</HI> of the <MILESTONE N="40"> Common-wealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and of the Do|minions and Territories thereunto belonging; and that He &s;hould have a Council of one and twenty Per&s;ons to be A&s;&s;i&s;tant to him in the&endq; Government.</Q></P>
<P>MOST Men did now conclude, that the &s;olly and &s;otti&s;hne&s;s of this la&s;t A&s;&s;embly was &s;o much fore&s;een, that, from their very fir&s;t coming together, it was determin'd what &s;hould follow their Di&s;&s;olution.

<P>IN this manner, and with &s;o little pains, this extraordinary Man, without any other rea&s;on than becau&s;e he had a mind to it, and without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and again&s;t the de&s;ire of all Noble Per&s;ons or Men of Qua|lity, or of any Number of Men, who, in the beginning of the Trou|bles, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of three hundred pounds Lands by the year, mount|ed him&s;elf into the Throne of three Kingdoms, without the Name of King, but with a greater Power and Authority than had ever been exer|ci&s;ed, <MILESTONE N="10"> or claimed by any King; and receiv'd greater evidence and ma|nife&s;tation of re&s;pect, and e&s;teem, from all the Kings and Princes in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> than had ever been &s;hew'd to any Monarch of tho&s;e Na|tions: which was &s;o much the more notorious, in that they all ab|horr'd him, when they trembled at his Power, and courted his Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THOUGH during this la&s;t year's un&s;ettlement in <HI>England, Cromwell</HI> had, <HI>ex plenitudine pote&s;tatis,</HI> taken care that there was a good Winter Guard of Ships in the <HI>Downs,</HI> yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> had enjoyed a very fruit|ful <MILESTONE N="20"> harve&s;t of Trade during that confu&s;ion, and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Power; and had &s;ent out their Fleets of Merchant Men under a Convoy, by the North of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and, by the return of that Convoy, receiv'd their Fleet from the <HI>Baltick</HI> with &s;ecurity: So that, upon the hope tho&s;e dome&s;tick contentions in <HI>England</HI> would not be &s;o &s;oon compo&s;ed, they begun to recover their Spirits again. But <HI>Cromwell</HI> had no &s;ooner <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Fleet this year</HI> 1653 <HI>&s;et forth under three Admi|rals.</HI></NOTE> broke the long Parliament, but, with great diligence, he cau&s;ed a &s;trong Fleet to be made ready again&s;t the Spring; and committed the Com|mand thereof to three Admirals joyntly; <HI>Blake,</HI> a Man well known, but not thought entirely enough devoted to <HI>Cromwell; Monk,</HI> whom <MILESTONE N="30"> he called out of <HI>Scotland</HI> as his own Creature; and <HI>Dean,</HI> a meer Sea|man, grown, from a common Mariner, to the reputation of a bold and excellent Officer.</P>
<P>THIS Fleet, in the beginning of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1653, met with the <HI>Dutch</HI> about the middle Seas over between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Zeeland;</HI> and made what ha&s;t they could to engage them. But the Wind not being favourable, it was noon before the Fight begun; which continued very &s;harp till the night parted them, without any vi&s;ible advantage to either &s;ide, &s;ave that <HI>Dean,</HI> one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admirals, was killed by a Can|non &s;hot from the Rere-Admiral of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The next morning, the <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Dutch</HI> having the advantage of the &s;mall Wind that was, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> charged &s;o furiou&s;ly upon the thicke&s;t part of them, without di&s;charging any of their Guns till they were at a very &s;mall di&s;tance, that they broke their Squadrons; and in the end forced them to fly, and make all the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>beaten at $$a in</HI> June.</NOTE> Sail they could for their own Coa&s;ts, leaving behind them eleven of their Ships; which were all taken; be&s;ides &s;ix which were &s;unk. The Execution on the <HI>Dutch</HI> was very great, as was likewi&s;e the number of the Pri&s;oners, as well Officers as Soldiers. The lo&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> was greate&s;t in their General <HI>Dean:</HI> there was, be&s;ides him, but one Cap|tain, and about two hundred Common Seamen, kill'd: the Number of <MILESTONE N="50"> the wounded was greater; nor did they lo&s;e one Ship, nor were &s;o di&s;abled but that they follow'd with the whole Fleet to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> whither the other fled; and being got into the <HI>Flie,</HI> and the

<HI>Texel,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for &s;ome time blocked them up in their own Har|bours, taking all &s;uch Ships as came bound for tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>THIS great Defeat &s;o humbled the States, that they made all po&s;&s;ible <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Span$</NOTE> ha&s;t to &s;end four Commi&s;&s;ioners into <HI>England</HI> to mediate for a Treaty, and a Ce&s;&s;ation of Armes; who were receiv'd very lo&s;tily by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and with &s;ome reprehen&s;ion for their want of warine&s;s in entring into &s;o unequal a Contention: yet He declared a gracious inclination to a Treaty, till the conclu&s;ion whereof he could admit no Ce&s;&s;ation; which being known in <HI>Holland,</HI> they would not &s;tay &s;o long under the re|proach and di&s;advantage of being be&s;ieged, and &s;hut up in their Ports; <MILESTONE N="10"> but made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to prepare another Fleet, &s;trong enough to re|move the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from their Coa&s;ts; which they believ'd was the be&s;t Expedient to advance their Treaty: and there cannot be a greater In|&s;tance of the opulency of that People, than that they &s;hould be able, after &s;o many lo&s;&s;es, and &s;o late a great Defeat, in &s;o &s;hort a time to &s;et out a Fleet &s;trong enough to vi&s;it tho&s;e who had &s;o lately overcome them, and who &s;hut them within their Ports.</P>
<P>THEIR Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> had, with &s;ome of the Fleet, retired into the <HI>Wierings,</HI> at too great a di&s;tance from the other Ports for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet to divide it &s;elf. He had, with a marvellous Indu&s;try, cau&s;ed his <MILESTONE N="20"> hurt Ships to be repaired; and more &s;evere puni&s;hment to be inflicted on tho&s;e who had behaved them&s;elves cowardly, than had ever been u&s;ed in that State. And the States publi&s;hed &s;o great and ample rewards to all Officers and Seamen who would, in that conjuncture, repair to their Service, that by the end of <HI>July,</HI> within le&s;s than two Months <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Span$</NOTE> after their Defeat, he came out of the <HI>Wierings</HI> with a Fleet of ninety and five Men of War; which a&s;&s;oon as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had notice of, they made towards him. But the Wind ri&s;ing, they were forced to &s;tand more to Sea, for fear of the Sands and Shelves upon that Coa&s;t. Whereupon <HI>Van Trump,</HI> all that Night, &s;tood into the <HI>Texel;</HI> where he joyn'd five <MILESTONE N="30"> and twenty more of their be&s;t Ships; and with this Addition, which made an hundred and twenty Sail, he faced the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> who, being at this time under the Command of <HI>Monk</HI> alone, kept &s;till to the Sea; and having got a little more room, and the Weather being a little clearer, tacked about, and were receiv'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> with great cou|rage and gallantry.</P>
<P>THE Battle continued very hot, and bloody on both &s;ides, from &s;ix <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another Sea $Word$</HI> Trump <HI>$Word$ the</HI> Eng$$$h the $Span$</NOTE> of the Clock in the Morning till one in the Afternoon; when the Ad|miral of <HI>Holland,</HI> the famous <HI>Van Trump,</HI> whil&s;t he very &s;ignally per|form'd the Office of a brave and bold Commander, was &s;hot with a Mu&s;|quet <MILESTONE N="40"> Bullet into the heart, of which he fell dead without &s;peaking word. This blow broke the courage of the re&s;t; who &s;eeing many of their Companions burnt and &s;unk, after having endured very hot Service, be|fore the evening, fled, and made all the Sail they could towards the <HI>Texel,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were not in a condition to pur&s;ue them; but &s;ound them|&s;elves obliged to retire to their own Coa&s;t, both to pre&s;erve and mend their maimed and torne Ships, and refre&s;h their wounded Men.</P>
<P>THIS Battle was the mo&s;t bloody that had been yet fought, both &s;ides rather endeavouring the de&s;truction of their Enemy's Fleet than the taking their Ships. On the <HI>Hollander</HI>'s part, between twenty and <MILESTONE N="50"> thirty of their Ships of War were fired, or &s;unk, and above one thou|&s;and Pri&s;oners taken. The Victory co&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> dear too; for four hundred common Men, and eight Captains, were &s;lain out right, and
<PB N="382" REF="3960">
above &s;even hundred Common Men, and five Captains, wounded. But they lo&s;t only one Ship, which was burn'd; and two or three more, though carried home, were di&s;abled for farther &s;ervice. The mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible part of the lo&s;s to the <HI>Dutch</HI> was the death of their Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> who, in re&s;pect of his Maritime experience, and the frequent Actions he had been engaged in, might very well be reckon'd among&s;t the mo&s;t eminent Commanders at Sea of that age, and to who&s;e me|mory his Country is farther indebted than they have yet acknowledged.</P>
<P>THIS was the la&s;t Engagement at Sea between the two Common|wealths: for as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were, by this la&s;t Defeat, and lo&s;s of their brave Admiral, totally di&s;pirited, and gave their Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>Lon|don</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> order to pro&s;ecute the Peace upon any conditions, &s;o <HI>Cromwell,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>makes Peace with the</HI> Dutch, April 1654.</NOTE> being by this time become Protector, was weary enough of &s;o chargea|ble a War, and knew he had much to do to &s;ettle the Government at home, and that he might choo&s;e more convenient Enemies abroad, who would neither be able to defend them&s;elves as well, or to do him &s;o much harm, as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had done, and could do. And therefore when he had drawn the <HI>Dutch</HI> to accept of &s;uch conditions as he thought fit to give them; <Q>among which one was, &startq;that they &s;hould not &s;uffer any of the King's Party, or any Enemy to the Common-wealth of <HI>England,&endq;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> to re&s;ide within their Dominions:</Q> and another, which was contain'd in a &s;ecret Article, to which the Great Seal of the States was affix'd, by which they obliged them&s;elves <Q>&startq;never to admit the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to be their State-holder, General, or Admiral; and likewi&s;e to deliver&endq; up the I&s;land of <HI>Polerone</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> (which they had taken from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the time of King <HI>James,</HI></Q> <Q>and u&s;urped it ever &s;ince) &startq;&endq;into the hands of the <HI>Ea&s;t India Engli&s;h</HI> Company again;</Q> and to pay a good Sum of Money for the old barbarous violence exerci&s;ed &s;o many years &s;ince at <HI>Amboyna;</HI> for which the two la&s;t Kings could never ob|tain &s;atisfaction and reparation: about the middle of <HI>April</HI> 1654 He made a Peace with the States General, with all the advantages he could <MILESTONE N="30"> de&s;ire, having indeed all the Per&s;ons of power and intere&s;t there, fa&s;t bound to him upon their joynt intere&s;t.</P>
<P>AND having now render'd him&s;elf terrible abroad, He forced <HI>Portu|gal</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He makes</HI> Por|tugal <HI>&s;end an Emba&s;&s;adour for Peace.</HI></NOTE> to &s;end an Emba&s;&s;adour to beg Peace, and to &s;ubmit to expiate the offence they had committed in receiving Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> by the pay|ment of a great Sum of Money; and brought the two Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;ue for his Allyance. He &s;u&s;pended for a time to choo&s;e a new Enemy, that he might make him&s;elf as much obey'd at home, as he was fear'd abroad: and in order to that, he pro&s;ecuted all tho&s;e who had been of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He per&s;ecutes the King's Party.</NOTE> the King's Party with the utmo&s;t Rigour; laid new impo&s;itions upon them; <MILESTONE N="40"> and upon every light rumour of a Con&s;piracy, clapp'd up all tho&s;e whom he thought fit to &s;u&s;pect, into clo&s;e Pri&s;ons; enjoyn'd others not to &s;tir from their own Hou&s;es, and bani&s;h'd all who had ever been in Arms for the King, from the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> and laid other penal|ties upon them, contrary to the Articles granted to them when they gave up their Arms, and to the indemnity upon making their Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>THE di&s;contents were general over the whole Kingdom, and among all &s;orts of People, of what Party &s;oever. The Presbyterians preach'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">The general d$$$ontents in the Nation</NOTE> boldly again&s;t the Liberty of Con&s;cience, and the mon&s;trous Licence <MILESTONE N="50"> that &s;prung from thence; and they who enjoy'd that Licence were as un&s;atisfied with the Government as any of the re&s;t, talk'd more loudly, and threaten'd the Per&s;on of <HI>Cromwell</HI> more than any. But
<PB N="383" REF="3970">
into the&s;e di&s;tempers <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not inqui&s;itive; nor would give tho&s;e Men an opportunity to talk, by calling them in que&s;tion, who, he knew, would &s;ay more than he was willing any body &s;hould hear; but intended to mortify tho&s;e unruly Spirits at the charge of the King's Party, and with the Spectacle of their &s;uffering upon any the mo&s;t tri|vial occa&s;ion. And if, in this general licence of di&s;cour&s;e, any Man who was &s;u&s;pected to wi&s;h well to the King, let fall any light word again&s;t the Government, he was &s;ure to be ca&s;t in Pri&s;on, and to be pur|&s;ued with all po&s;&s;ible &s;everity and cruelty: and he could not want fre|quent opportunities of revenge this way. It was the greate&s;t con&s;ola|tion <MILESTONE N="10"> to mi&s;erable Men, who had, in them&s;elves or their friends, been undone by their Loyalty, to meet together, and lament their condi|tions: and this brought on invectives again&s;t the Per&s;on of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> Wine, and good Fellow&s;hip, and the continuance of the di&s;cour&s;e, di&s;|po&s;ing them to take notice of the univer&s;al hatred that the whole Na|tion had of him, and to fancy how ea&s;y it would be to de&s;troy him. And commonly there was, in all tho&s;e meetings, &s;ome corrupted Per&s;on of the Party, who fomented mo&s;t the di&s;cour&s;e, and, for a vile recom|pence, betrayed his Companions, and inform'd of all, and more than had been &s;aid. Whereupon a new Plot was di&s;cover'd again&s;t the Com|mon-wealth <MILESTONE N="20"> and the Per&s;on of the Protector, and a high Court of Ju|&s;tice was pre&s;ently erected to try the Criminals; which rarely ab&s;olv'd any Man who was brought before them. But to this kind of Trial they never expo&s;ed any Man but tho&s;e of the King's Party; the other, of whom they were more afraid, had too many friends to &s;uffer them to be brought before &s;uch a Tribunal; which had been fir&s;t erected to mur|ther the King him&s;elf, and continued to root out all who adher'd to him. No Man, who had ever been again&s;t the King (except he became afterwards for him) was ever brought before that extravagant Power; but &s;uch were remitted to the Trial of the Law by Juries, which &s;eldom <MILESTONE N="30"> condemn'd any.</P>

He expre&s;&s;ed a marvellous contempt of death; <Q>&startq;&endq;which,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he&endq; &s;uffer'd without having committed any fault.</Q> He profe&s;&s;ed his du|ty to the King, and his reverence for the Church; and earne&s;tly and pathetically advi&s;ed the People to return to their fidelity to both; <MILESTONE N="20"> <Q>&startq;&endq;which, he told them,</Q> <Q>&startq;they would at la&s;t be compell'd to do after&endq; all their Sufferings.</Q> He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf mo&s;t to the Soldiers; <Q>told them, &startq;how unworthily they pro&s;tituted them&s;elves to &s;erve the Am|bition&endq; of an unworthy Tyrant;</Q> <Q>and conjured them &startq;to for&s;ake Him,&endq; and to &s;erve the King;</Q> which, he was &s;ure, they would at la&s;t do. And &s;o having devoutly recommended the King, and the Kingdom, and Him&s;elf, to God in very pious Prayers, he ended his Life with as much Chri&s;tian Re&s;olution, as can be expected from the mo&s;t compo&s;ed Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THE Protector was prevail'd with to &s;hew more re&s;pect to M^r <HI>Ge|rard</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Gerard <HI>be|headed on</HI> Tower-Hill <HI>in the after|noon of the &s;ame day.</HI></NOTE> in cau&s;ing him to be beheaded, who was brought the afternoon of the &s;ame day to a Scaffold upon the <HI>Tower-Hill.</HI> But they were &s;o ill plea&s;ed with the behaviour of Him who &s;uffer'd in the morning, that they would not permit the other to &s;peak to the People, but pre&s;&s;ed him to di&s;cover all the Secrets of the Plot and Con&s;piracy. <Q>He told them, &startq;that if he had a hundred lives, he would lo&s;e them all to do the King any &s;ervice; and was now willing to die upon that &s;u&s;picion; but that he was very innocent of what was charged again&s;t him; that he had not enter'd into, or con&s;ented to any Plot or Con&s;piracy, nor given&endq; any countenance to any di&s;cour&s;e to that purpo&s;e;</Q> and offer'd again to <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;peak to the People, and to magnify the King: upon which they would not &s;uffer him to proceed; and thereupon, with great and undaunted courage, he laid down his head upon the Block.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day was concluded with a very exemplary piece of Ju&s;tice, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;ame day and place the</HI> Portugal <HI>Em|ba&s;&s;adour's Brother be|headed.</HI></NOTE> and of a very different nature from the other two.

<PB N="385" REF="3990">
him &s;en&s;ible of receiving &s;ome affront. Whereupon the <HI>Don</HI> repair'd thither again the next day, with many Servants, better arm'd, and provided for any Encounter, imagining he &s;hould there find his former Adver&s;ary, who did not expect that vi&s;it. But the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> not di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Per&s;ons, and finding many Gentlemen walking there, and, among&s;t the re&s;t, one he believ'd very like the other, he thought he was not to lo&s;e the occa&s;ion, and enter'd into a new quarrel; in which a Gentleman utterly unacquainted with what had formerly pa&s;&s;ed, and walking there accidentally, was kill'd, and others hurt; upon which, the People ri&s;ing from all the Neighbour places, <HI>Don Pantaleon</HI> thought <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;it to make his retreat to his Brother's Hou&s;e; which he did, and cau&s;ed the Gates to be lock'd, and put all the Servants in Armes to defend the Hou&s;e again&s;t the People; which had pur&s;ued him, and flock'd now together from all parts to apprehend tho&s;e who had cau&s;ed the di&s;order, and had kill'd a Gentleman.</P>
<P>THE Emba&s;&s;adour knew nothing of the affair, but look'd upon him|&s;elf as affronted, and a&s;&s;aulted by a rude Multitude; and took care to defend his Hou&s;e till the Ju&s;tice &s;hould allay the Tumult. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was quickly adverti&s;ed of the in&s;olence, and &s;ent an Officer with Sol|diers to demand and &s;ei&s;e upon all the Per&s;ons who had been engaged <MILESTONE N="20"> in the Action: and &s;o the Emba&s;&s;adour came to be inform'd of the truth of the &s;tory, with which he was exceedingly afflicted and a&s;toni&s;h'd. The Officer demanded the Per&s;on of his Brother, who was well known, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, to be deliver'd to him, without which he would break open the Hou&s;e, and find them wherever they were conceal'd. The Emba&s;&s;adour demanded the Privilege that was due to his Hou&s;e by the Law of Nations, and which he would de&s;end again&s;t any violence with his own life, and the lives of all his family; but find|ing the Officer re&s;olute, and that he &s;hould be too weak in the encoun|ter, he de&s;ired re&s;pite till he might &s;end to the Protector; which was <MILESTONE N="30"> granted to him. He complain'd of the Injury that was done him, and de&s;ired an Audience. <Q><HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ent him word, &startq;that a Gentleman had been murther'd, and many others hurt; and that Ju&s;tice mu&s;t be &s;a|tisfied; and therefore required that all the Per&s;ons engaged might be de|liver'd into the hands of his Officer; without which, if he &s;hould with|draw the Soldiers, and de&s;i&s;t the requiring it, the People would pull down the Hou&s;e, and execute Ju&s;tice them&s;elves; of which he would not an&s;wer for the effect. When this was done, he &s;hould have an&endq; Audience, and all the &s;atisfaction it was in his power to give.</Q> <Q>The Emba&s;&s;adour de&s;ired &startq;that his Brother, and the re&s;t, might remain in <MILESTONE N="40"> his Hou&s;e, and he would be re&s;pon&s;ible, and produce them before the&endq; Ju&s;tice as the time &s;hould be a&s;&s;ign'd.</Q> <Q>But nothing would &s;erve but the delivery of the Per&s;ons, and the People increa&s;ed their cry &startq;that they&endq; would pull down the Hou&s;e.</Q> Whereupon the Emba&s;&s;adour was com|pell'd to deliver up his Brother, and the re&s;t of the Per&s;ons; who were all &s;ent Pri&s;oners to <HI>Newgate.</HI> The Emba&s;&s;adour u&s;ed all the In&s;tances he could for his Brother, being willing to leave the re&s;t to the mercy of the Law; <Q>but could receive no other an&s;wer but &startq;that Ju&s;tice mu&s;t&endq; be done;</Q> and Ju&s;tice was done to the full; for they were all brought to their Tryal at the Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Newgate,</HI> and there &s;o many of them <MILESTONE N="50"> condemn'd to be hang'd as were found guilty. The re&s;t of tho&s;e who were condemn'd, were executed at <HI>Tiburn;</HI> and <HI>Don Pantaleon</HI> him|&s;elf was brought to the Scaffold on <HI>Tower</HI>-Hill, a&s;&s;oon as M$ <HI>Ge$ard</HI>
<PB N="386" REF="4000">

<P>THERE were another le&s;s wary, becau&s;e a more de&s;perate Party, <NOTE PLACE="marg">e&s;pecially the $Word$.</NOTE> which were the Levellers; many whereof had been the mo&s;t active Agi|tators in the Army, who had executed his Orders and De&s;igns in in|cen&s;ing the Army again&s;t the Parliament, and had been at that time his &s;ole Confidents and Bed-fellows; who, from the time that he a&s;&s;umed the Title of Protector, which to them was as odious as that of King, pro&s;e&s;&s;ed a mortal hatred to his Per&s;on; and he well knew both the&s;e People had too much credit in his Army, and with &s;ome principal Offi|cers of it. Of the&s;e Men he &s;tood in more fear than of all the King's Party; of which he had in truth very little apprehen&s;ion, though he <MILESTONE N="40"> colour'd many of the preparations he made again&s;t the other, as if pro|vided again&s;t the dangers threaten'd from them.</P>
<P>BUT the time drew near now, when he was obliged by the In&s;tru|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">He calls a Par|liament after $Word$ Method</NOTE> of Government, and upon his Oath, to call a Parliament; which &s;eem'd to him the only means left to compo&s;e the minds of the People to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Government.

<P>THE day of their meeting was the third of <HI>September</HI> in the year <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Parlia|ment meets</HI> Sept. 3. 1654.</NOTE> 1654, within le&s;s than a year after he had been declared Protector; when, after they had been at a Sermon in the Abby at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> they all came into the Painted Chamber; where his Highne&s;s made them a large di&s;cour&s;e; <Q>and told them, &startq;that that Parliament was &s;uch a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sub&s;tance of his Speech to them</NOTE> Congregation of wi&s;e, prudent, and di&s;creet Per&s;ons, that <HI>England</HI> had &s;carce &s;een the like: that he &s;hould forbear relating to them the Series of God's Providence all along to that time, becau&s;e it was well known to them; and only declare to them, that the erection of his pre&s;ent power was a &s;uitable providence to the re&s;t, by &s;hewing what a con|dition <MILESTONE N="20"> the&s;e Nations were in at its erection: that Then every Man's heart was again&s;t another's, every Man's intere&s;t divided again&s;t an|other's, and allmo&s;t every thing grown Arbitrary: that there was grown up a general contempt of God and Chri&s;t, the Grace of God turn'd into wantonne&s;s, and his Spirit made a Cloak for all wickedne&s;s and prophanene&s;s, nay, that the Ax was even laid to the root of the Mini&s;try, and &s;warms of Je&s;uits were continually wafted over hither to con&s;ume, and de&s;troy the Welfare of <HI>England:</HI> that the Nation was then likewi&s;e engaged in a deep War with <HI>Portugal, Holland,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that the whole Nation was one heap of confu&s;ion; but that <MILESTONE N="30"> this pre&s;ent Government was calculated for the People's Intere&s;t, let malignant Spirits &s;ay what they would; and that, with humblene&s;s towards God, and mode&s;ty towards Them, he would recount &s;ome|what in the behalf of the Government. Fir&s;t, it had endeavour'd to reform the Law; it had put into the Seat of Ju&s;tice Men of known integrity, and ability; it had &s;ettled a way for probation of Mini&s;ters to Preach the Go&s;pel: and be&s;ides all this, it had called a free Parlia|ment: that, ble&s;&s;ed be God, they that day &s;aw a free Parliament: then as to Wars, that a Peace was made with <HI>Denmark, Sweden,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and was likewi&s;e near concluding with <HI>France:</HI> that <MILESTONE N="40"> the&s;e things were but entrances, and doors of hopes; but now he made no que&s;tion to enable them to lay the top Stone of the Work, recom|mending to them that maxim, that Peace, though it were made, was not to be tru&s;ted farther than it con&s;i&s;ted with Intere&s;t: that the great Work which now lay upon this Parliament, was, that the Govern|ment of <HI>England</HI> might be &s;ettled upon terms of Honour: that they would avoid confu&s;ions, le&s;t Foreign States &s;hould take Advantage of them: that, as for him&s;elf, he did not &s;peak like one that would be a Lord over them, but as one that would be a fellow-Servant in that&endq; great Affair: and concluded,</Q> <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould go to their Hou&s;e, and&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> there make choice of a Speaker&punc;</Q> which they pre&s;ently did, and &s;eem'd very unanimous in their fir&s;t Act, which was the making choice of <HI>Wil|liam</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">William. $Span$ <HI>$Span$ Speaker.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lenthall</HI> to be their Speaker; which Agreement was upon very

di&s;agreeing Principles. <HI>Cromwell</HI> having de&s;ign'd him for lucks &s;ake, and being well acquainted with his temper, concluded, that he would be made a property in This, as well as he had been in the long Parlia|ment, when he allways complied with that Party that was mo&s;t power|ful. And the other Per&s;ons who meant nothing that <HI>Cromwell</HI> did, were well plea&s;ed, out of hope that the &s;ame Man's being in the Chair might facilitate the renewing and reviving the former Hou&s;e; which they looked upon as the true legitimate Parliament, &s;trangled by the Tyranny of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and yet that it had life enough left in it.</P>
<P><Q>LENTHALL was no &s;ooner in his Chair than it was propo&s;ed, &startq;that <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Actings.</NOTE> they might in the fir&s;t place con&s;ider by what Authority they came thither, and whether that which had conven'd them, had a Lawful&endq; power to that purpo&s;e.</Q> From which Subject the Protector's Crea|tures, and tho&s;e of the Army, endeavour'd to divert them by all the Arguments they could. Notwith&s;tanding which, the current of the Hou&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon the fir&s;t clearing that point, as the foundation, upon which all their Coun&s;els mu&s;t be built: <Q>and as many of the Members po&s;itively enough declared again&s;t that power, &s;o one of them, more confident than the re&s;t, &s;aid plainly, &startq;that they might ea&s;ily di&s;cern the Snares which were laid to entrap the Privileges of the People; and <MILESTONE N="20"> for his own part, as God had made him in&s;trumental in cutting down Tyranny in one Per&s;on, &s;o now he could not endure to &s;ee the Nation's Liberties &s;hackled by another, who&s;e Right to the Government could not be mea&s;ured otherwi&s;e than by the length of his Sword, which&endq; alone had embolden'd him to command his Commanders.</Q> <Q>This Spirit prevailed &s;o far, that, for eight days together, tho&s;e of the Council of Officers, and others (who were called the Court Party) could not divert the que&s;tion from being put, &startq;whether the Government &s;hould be by a&endq; Protector and a Parliament,</Q> any other way than by lengthning the De|bate, and then Adjourning the Hou&s;e when the que&s;tion was ready to <MILESTONE N="30"> be put, becau&s;e they plainly &s;aw that it would be carried in the Ne|gative.</P>
<P>THE continuance of this warm Debate in the Hou&s;e, in which the Protector's own Per&s;on was not treated with much reverence, exceed|ingly perplexed him; and obliged him once more to try, what re&s;pect his Soveraign pre&s;ence would produce towards a better compo&s;ure. So he came again to the Painted Chamber, and &s;ent for his Parliament to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>&s;peaks to them in the Painted Chamber.</HI></NOTE> come to him; <Q>and then told them, &startq;that the great God of Heaven and Earth knew what grief and &s;orrow of heart it was to him, to find them falling into heats and divi&s;ions: that he would have them take notice <MILESTONE N="40"> of this, that the &s;ame Government made Him a Protector, that made Them a Parliament: that as They were intru&s;ted in &s;ome things, &s;o was He in others: that in the Government were certain fundamentals, which could not be alter'd; to wit, that the Government &s;hould be in a &s;ingle Per&s;on and a Parliament; that Parliaments &s;hould not be per|petual, and allways &s;itting; that the Militia &s;hould not be tru&s;ted in|to one hand, or power, but &s;o as the Parliament might have a check on the Protector, and the Protector on the Parliament; that in mat|ters of Religion there ought to be a Liberty of Con&s;cience, and that per&s;ecution in the Church was not to be tolerated: The&s;e, he &s;aid, <MILESTONE N="50"> were unalterable fundamentals: as for other things in the Govern|ment, they were examinable and alterable as the State of Affairs did require: that, for his own part, he was even overwhelmed with grief,
<PB N="389" REF="4030">
to &s;ee that any of them &s;hould go about to overthrow what was &s;ettled, contrary to the Tru&s;t they had receiv'd from the People; which could not but bring very great inconveniences upon them&s;elves and the Na|tion.&endq;</Q> When he had made this frank Declaration unto them what they were to tru&s;t to, the better to confirm them in their duty, he had ap|pointed a Guard to attend at the door of the Parliament Hou&s;e, and there to re&s;train all Men from entring into the Hou&s;e who refu&s;ed to <NOTE PLACE="marg">He admits none into the Hou&s;e but $$$h as &s;ub&s;cribed an Engage|ment to him.</NOTE> &s;ub&s;cribe this following Engagement: <Q>&startq;I do hereby promi&s;e and engage to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and &s;hall not (according to the tenour of this Indenture, whereby I am return'd to &s;erve in Parliament) <MILESTONE N="10"> propo&s;e or give any Con&s;ent to alter the Government as it is &s;ettled in&endq; one Per&s;on and a Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Engagement a con&s;iderable part of the Members utterly re|fu&s;ed to &s;ign, and called it a violation of the Privilege of Parliament, and an ab&s;olute depriving them of that freedom which was e&s;&s;ential to it. So they were excluded, and re&s;train'd from entring into the Hou&s;e: and they who did &s;ub&s;cribe it, and had thereupon Liberty to fit there, were yet &s;o refractory to any Propo&s;ition that might &s;ettle him in the Government in the manner he de&s;ired it, that, after the five Months <MILESTONE N="20"> near &s;pent in wrangling, and u&s;ele&s;s di&s;cour&s;es (during which he was not to attempt the di&s;&s;olution of them, by his In&s;trument of Govern|ment) he took the fir&s;t opportunity to di&s;&s;olve them; and upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He di&s;&s;olves them</HI> Jan. 22.</NOTE> two and twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> with &s;ome reproaches, he let them know he could do the bu&s;ine&s;s without them; and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with much evidence of his Di&s;plea&s;ure: and They again retired to their ha|bitations, re&s;olv'd to wait another opportunity of revenge, and in the mean time to give no evidence of their &s;ubmitting to his U&s;urpation, by undertaking any Imployment or Office under his Authority, He as carefully endeavouring and watching to find &s;uch an Advantage again&s;t them, as might make them liable to the penalty of the Laws.

<P>THE former had been bred a Scholar in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">John Wild|man</NOTE> and being young, and of a pregnant Wit, in the beginning of the Re|bellion meant to make his Fortune in the War; and cho&s;e to depend upon <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s countenance and advice when he was not above the degree of a Captain of a Troop of Hor&s;e him&s;elf, and was much e&s;teem'd and valued by him, and made an Officer; and was &s;o active in con|triving <MILESTONE N="40"> and &s;omenting Jealou&s;ies and di&s;contents, and &s;o dextrous in compo&s;ing, or improving any di&s;gu&s;ts, and &s;o in&s;pired with the &s;pirit of praying and preaching, when tho&s;e gifts came into reque&s;t, and be|came thriving Arts, that about the time when the King was taken from <HI>Holmby,</HI> and it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Army &s;hould enter into Conte&s;ts with the Parliament, <HI>John Wildman</HI> grew to be one of the principal Agitators, and was mo&s;t relied upon by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to infu&s;e tho&s;e things into the minds of the Soldiers, and to conduct them in the managery of their di&s;contents, as might mo&s;t advance tho&s;e de&s;igns He then had; <MILESTONE N="50"> and quickly got the reputation of a Man of parts; and, having a &s;mooth Pen, drew many of the Papers which fir&s;t kindled the fire between the Parliament and the Army, that was not afterwards extingui&s;hed but
<PB N="390" REF="4040">
in the ruin of both. His Reputation in tho&s;e faculties made him quit the Army; where he was become a Major; and where he kept &s;till a great Intere&s;t, and betook him&s;elf to Civil Affairs, in the &s;ollici|tation of Suites depending in the Parliament, or before Committees; where he had much credit with tho&s;e who had mo&s;t power to do Right or Wrong, and &s;o made him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who had need of &s;uch Protection from the Tyranny of the time. By the&s;e Arts he thrived, and got much more than he could have done in the Army, and kept, and encrea&s;ed his credit there, by the Intere&s;t he had in other places. When <HI>Cromwell</HI> declined the ways of e&s;tabli&s;hing the Common-wealth, <HI>Wildman,</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t, for&s;ook him; and enter'd, warily, into any <MILESTONE N="10"> coun&s;els which were like to de&s;troy him: and upon the di&s;&s;olution of this la&s;t Parliament, having le&s;s of flegme, and &s;o le&s;s patience than other Men, to expect another opportunity, and in the mean time to leave him to e&s;tabli&s;h his greatne&s;s, he did believe he &s;hould be able to make &s;uch a &s;chi&s;m in the Army, as would give an opportunity to other enraged Per&s;ons to take vengeance upon him.</P>
<P>CROMWELL knew the Man, and his undermining faculties; knew he had &s;ome de&s;ign in hand, but could not make any &s;uch di&s;covery as might warrant a publick Pro&s;ecution; but appointed &s;ome tru&s;ty Spies <MILESTONE N="20"> (of which he had plenty) to watch him very narrowly, and, by being often with him, to find his Papers; the &s;preading whereof, he knew, would be the Preamble to any con&s;piracy of His. Shortly after the di&s;|&s;olution of that Parliament, the&s;e In&s;truments of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s &s;urpri&s;ed him in a room, where he thought he had been &s;afe enough, as he was writing a Declaration; and &s;ei&s;ed upon the Papers; <Q>the title whereof was, &startq;a Declaration, containing the rea&s;ons and motives which oblige&endq; Us to take up Armes again&s;t <HI>Oliver Cromwell;</HI></Q> and though it was not fini&s;h'd, yet in that that was done, there was all venom imaginable ex|pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, and a large and bitter Narration of all his &s;oul breach of tru&s;t, and perjuries, enough to have expo&s;ed any Man to the <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;evere&s;t Judgement of that time; and as much as he could wi&s;h to di&s;|cover again&s;t Him, or any Man whom he mo&s;t de&s;ired to de&s;troy. The I&s;&s;ue was, the Man was &s;treightly impri&s;on'd, and preparations made for his Trial, and towards his Execution, which all Men expected. But, whether <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ound that there were more engaged with him than could be brought to Ju&s;tice, or were fit to be di&s;cover'd (as many Men believ'd) or that <HI>Wildman</HI> obliged him&s;elf for the time to come not only to be quiet, but to be a Spy for him upon others (as others at that time &s;u&s;pected, and had rea&s;on for it afterwards) after a &s;hort time of Impri&s;onment, the Man was re&s;tored to his Liberty; and re&s;orted, with <MILESTONE N="40"> the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s and reputation, to his former cour&s;e of Life; in which he thrived very notably.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e of <HI>John Lilburn</HI> was much more wonderful, and admini|&s;ter'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">John Lilburn</NOTE> more occa&s;ion of di&s;cour&s;e and ob&s;ervation. This Man, before the Troubles, was a poor Book-binder; and for procuring &s;ome &s;edi|tious Pamphlets again&s;t the Church and State to be printed and di&s;per&s;ed, had been &s;everely cen&s;ured in the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> and receiv'd a &s;harp Ca&s;tigation, which made him more ob&s;tinate and malicious again&s;t them; and, as he afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, in the melancholy of his Impri&s;onment and by reading the Book of Martyrs, he rai&s;ed in him&s;elf a marvellous <MILESTONE N="50"> inclination and appetite to &s;uffer in the defence or for the vindication of any oppre&s;&s;ed Truth; and found him&s;elf very much confirm'd in that
<PB N="391" REF="4050">
&s;pirit; and in that time diligently collected, and read all tho&s;e Libels and Books, which had anciently, as well as lately been written again&s;t the Church: from whence, with the venom, he had likewi&s;e contracted the impudence and bitterne&s;s of their Style; and by practice, brought him&s;elf to the faculty of writing like them: and &s;o, when that Licence broke in of printing all that malice and wit could &s;ugge&s;t, he publi&s;h'd &s;ome Pamphlets in his own Name, full of that confidence and virulency, which might a&s;per&s;e the Government mo&s;t to the &s;en&s;e of the People, and to their humour. When the War begun, he put him&s;elf into the Army; and was taken Pri&s;oner by the King's Forces in that Engagement at <HI>Brentford,</HI> &s;hortly after the battle of <HI>Edge-Hill;</HI> and being then a <MILESTONE N="10"> Man much known, and talk'd of for his qualities above-mention'd, he was not &s;o well treated in Pri&s;on as was like to reconcile him; and being brought before the Chief Ju&s;tice, to be tried for Trea&s;on by a Com|mi&s;&s;ion of Oyer and Terminer (in which method the King intended then to have proceeded again&s;t the Rebels which &s;hould be taken) he behaved him&s;elf with &s;o great impudence, in extolling the power of the Parlia|ment, that it was manife&s;t he had an ambition to have been made a Martyr for that Cau&s;e. <Q>But as he was liberally &s;upplied from his Friends at <HI>London</HI> (and the Parliament in expre&s;s terms declared, &startq;that they would inflict puni&s;hment upon the Pri&s;oners they had of the King's <MILESTONE N="20"> Party, in the &s;ame manner as <HI>Lilburn</HI> and the re&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer at <HI>Ox|ford)&endq;</HI> &s;o he did find means to corrupt the Mar&s;hal who had the cu&s;tody of him;</Q> and made his e&s;cape into the Parliament Quarters; where he was receiv'd with publick Joy, as a Champion that had defied the King in his own Court.</P>
<P>FROM this time he was entertain'd by <HI>Cromwell</HI> with great familia|rity, and, in his conte&s;ts with the Parliament, was of much u&s;e to him, and privacy with him. But he begun then to find him of &s;o re&s;tle&s;s and unruly a Spirit, and to make tho&s;e advances in Religion again&s;t the <MILESTONE N="30"> Presbyterians before he thought it &s;ea&s;onable, that he di&s;pen&s;ed with his pre&s;ence in the Army, where he was an Officer of Name, and made him re&s;ide in <HI>London,</HI> where he wi&s;h'd that temper &s;hould be improv'd. And when the Parliament was &s;o much offended with his &s;editious hu|mour, and the Pamphlets he publi&s;h'd every day in Religion, with re|flections upon their proceedings, that they re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute him with great rigour (towards which the A&s;&s;embly of Divines, which he had likewi&s;e provok'd, contributed their de&s;ire, and demand) <HI>Cromwell</HI> writ a very pa&s;&s;ionate Letter to the Parliament, <Q>&startq;that they would not &s;o much di&s;courage their Army, that was fighting for them, as to cen|&s;ure an Officer of it for his opinion in point of Con&s;cience; for the <MILESTONE N="40"> Liberty whereof, and to free them&s;elves from the &s;hackles in which&endq; the Bi&s;hops would en&s;lave them, that Army had been principally rai&s;ed.</Q> Upon which, all farther pro&s;ecution again&s;t <HI>Lilburn</HI> was declin'd at that time, though he declined not the farther provocation; and continued to make the Proceedings of the Parliament as odious as he could. But from the time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had di&s;per&s;ed that Parliament, and was in effect in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sovereign Power, <HI>Lilburn</HI> withdrew his favour for him; and thought him now an Enemy worthy of his di&s;plea&s;ure; and, both in di&s;cour&s;es and writings, in Pamphlets and Invectives, loaded <MILESTONE N="50"> him with all the A&s;per&s;ions of Hypocri&s;y, Lying, and Tyranny, and all other imputations and reproaches which either he de&s;erv'd, or the ma|lice or bitterne&s;s of the other's Nature could &s;ugge&s;t to him, to make
<PB N="392" REF="4060">
him the mo&s;t univer&s;ally odious that a faithle&s;s perjured Per&s;on could be.</P>
<P>CROMWELL could bear ill language and reproaches with le&s;s di&s;|turbance, and concernment, than any Per&s;on in Authority had ever done: yet the pro&s;ecution this Man exerci&s;ed him with, made him plain|ly di&s;cern that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve his Dignity, or to have any &s;ecurity in the Government, whil&s;t His Licence continued; and therefore, after he had &s;et &s;pies upon him to ob&s;erve his Actions, and collect his Words, and upon advice with the Council at Law of the State, was con&s;idently inform'd, <Q>&startq;that, as well by the old e&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws, as by new Ordinances, <HI>Lilburn</HI> was guilty of High Trea&s;on, and had for|feited&endq; his Life,</Q> if he were pro&s;ecuted in any Court of Ju&s;tice, he cau&s;ed <MILESTONE N="10"> him to be &s;ent to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and at the next Se&s;&s;ions to be indicted of High Trea&s;on: all the Judges being pre&s;ent, and the Council at Law to inforce the Evidence, and all care being taken for the return of &s;uch a Jury as might be fit for the importance of the Ca&s;e, <HI>Lilburn</HI> appear'd undaunted, and with the confidence of a Man that was to play a Prize before the People for their own Liberty; he pleaded not-guilty, and heard all the Charge and Evidence again&s;t him with patience enough, &s;ave that, by interrupting the Lawyers, &s;ometimes, who pro&s;ecuted him, and by &s;harp an&s;wers to &s;ome que&s;tions of the Judges, he &s;hew'd that he had no reverence for their Per&s;ons, nor any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their <MILESTONE N="20"> Authority. The whole day was &s;pent in his Tryal; and when he came to make his Defence, he mingled &s;o much Law in his di&s;cour&s;e to in|validate their Authority, and to make it appear &s;o Tyrannical, that nei|ther their Lives, Liberties, nor E&s;tates were in any degree &s;ecure, whil&s;t that U&s;urpation was exerci&s;ed; <Q>and an&s;wer'd all the matters objected again&s;t him with &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance, making them &startq;to contain nothing of High Trea&s;on, and That to be a Government again&s;t which High&endq; Trea&s;on could not be committed;</Q> <Q>and telling them &startq;that all true born <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men were obliged to oppo&s;e this Tyranny, as he had done purely for Their &s;akes, and that he had done it only for their &s;akes, <MILESTONE N="30"> and to pre&s;erve them from being Slaves, contrary to his own profit&endq; and worldly Intere&s;t:</Q> <Q>He told them &startq;how much he had been in <HI>Crom|well</HI>'s Friend&s;hip: that he might have receiv'd any benefit, or pre&s;er|ment from him, if he would have &s;ate &s;till, and &s;een his Country en|&s;lav'd; which becau&s;e he would not do, he was brought hither to have his life taken from him by their Judgement; which he appre|hended&endq; not:</Q> <Q>he defended him&s;elf with that vigour, and charm'd the Jury &s;o powerfully, that, again&s;t all the direction and charge the Judges could give them (who a&s;&s;ured them &startq;that the words and actions fully proved again&s;t the Pri&s;oner, were High Trea&s;on by the Law; and <MILESTONE N="40"> that they were bound, by all the obligation of Con&s;cience, to find him&endq; guilty) after no long con&s;ultation between them&s;elves,</Q> they return'd with their Verdict, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he was Not-guilty:</Q> nor could they be per|&s;waded by the Judges to change or recede from their Verdict: which in|finitely enraged and perplex'd <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who look'd upon it as a greater Defeat than the lo&s;s of a Battle would have been. And though <HI>Lilburn</HI> was thus acquitted in the year 1653, yet <HI>Cromwell</HI> would never &s;uffer him to be &s;et at Liberty, as by the Law he ought to have been, but &s;ent him from Pri&s;on to Pri&s;on, and kept him enclo&s;ed there till He him&s;elf died. The&s;e two In&s;tances of Per&s;ons not otherwi&s;e con&s;idera|ble, <MILESTONE N="50"> are thought pertinent to be in&s;erted, as an evidence of the temper of the Nation; and how far the Spirits of that time were from paying
<PB N="393" REF="4070">
a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that power, when no body had the courage to lift up their hands again&s;t it.</P>
<P>WHATEVER unea&s;ine&s;s and perplexity <HI>Cromwell</HI> found in his condi|tion at home, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's condition a|broad.</NOTE> the King found no benefit from it abroad, or from the Friend&s;hip, or the Indignation of other Princes; They had all the &s;ame terrible Apprehen&s;ion of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s power as if he had been landed with an Army in any of their Dominions, and look'd upon the King's condi|tion as de&s;perate, and not to be &s;upported. The Treaty between <HI>France</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell<HI>'s Treaty with</HI> France.</NOTE> and <HI>England</HI> proceeded very fa&s;t; and every day produced fre&s;h Evi|dence of the good Intelligence between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Cardinal. The <MILESTONE N="10"> Ships and Pri&s;oners which had been taken when they went to relieve <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and by the taking whereof <HI>Dunkirk</HI> had been lo&s;t, were now re&s;tored, and &s;et at liberty; and &s;uch mutual Offices perform'd between them, as, with frequent evidences of Aver&s;ion from the King and his Intere&s;t, made it very manife&s;t to his Maje&s;ty, that his re&s;idence would not be &s;uffer'd to continue longer in <HI>France,</HI> after the Alliance &s;hould be publi&s;h'd with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> which was not yet perfected, by the Car|dinal's blu&s;hing to con&s;ent to &s;ome Propo&s;itions, without which the other's fa&s;t friend&s;hip was not to be obtain'd; and he was not willing that mode&s;ty &s;hould be conquer'd at once, though every body knew it <MILESTONE N="20"> would quickly be pro&s;tituted.</P>
<P>THERE could be no doubt but that the King was heartily weary of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King thinks of re|treating out of</HI> France; <HI>but whither? was the Que&s;tion</HI></NOTE> being in a place where he was &s;o ill treated; where he liv'd &s;o uncom|fortably, and from whence he fore&s;aw that he &s;hould &s;oon be driven. But as he had no Money to enable him to remove, or to pay the Debts he ow'd there, &s;o he knew not to what place to repair, where he might find a Civil Reception. <HI>Holland</HI> was bound not to admit him into their Dominions, and by their Example had &s;hew'd other Princes, and States, what conditions They mu&s;t &s;ubmit to who would be Allies to <HI>Cromwell.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was at the &s;ame time contending with <HI>France</HI> for <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Friend&s;hip, and thought he had &s;ome Advantage with him by the Re&s;idence his Maje&s;ty had in <HI>France:</HI> &s;o there could be no thought of repairing into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and that he could be admitted to &s;tay there. The Prote&s;tants, in mo&s;t places, expre&s;&s;ed much more Inclination to his Rebels than to Him. The Roman Catholicks look'd upon him as in &s;o de&s;perate a condition, that he would in a &s;hort time be nece&s;&s;itated to throw him&s;elf into their Armes by changing his Religion, without which they generally declared, <Q>&startq;&endq;they would never give him the lea&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q> In this di&s;tre&s;s, his Maje&s;ty re&s;umed the con&s;iderations he had formerly enter'd upon, of &s;ending to the Diet; which was &s;ummon'd by the Em|perour <MILESTONE N="40"> to meet &s;hortly at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> to make choice of a King of the <HI>Romans.</HI> And <HI>Germany</HI> being then in Peace, the Emperour made little doubt of finding a concurrence in the choice of the King of <HI>Hun|gary</HI> his elde&s;t Son to be made King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and thereby to be &s;ure to &s;ucceed him in the Empire. Our King had long de&s;ign'd to &s;end the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> on that Errand, to try what the Emperour, and Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> would do, in &s;uch a conjuncture, towards the uniting all other Princes with them&s;elves, in undertaking a quarrel they were all concern'd in, to re&s;tore a Prince &s;o injur'd and oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;o odious a Rebellion; and in the mean time, of which there appear'd to be more hope, what <MILESTONE N="50"> contribution they would make towards his Support; and likewi&s;e, upon this occa&s;ion, what fit place might be found, in the neare&s;t parts of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> for the King to repair to; where he might attend his better de&s;tiny.</P>

IT was mo&s;t &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and the nece&s;&s;ity of the King's condition, that this Affair &s;hould be di&s;patch'd in as private a way as was po&s;&s;ible, and with as little expence, it being impo&s;&s;ible to &s;end an Emba&s;&s;adour in &s;uch an Equipage, as, at &s;uch an illu&s;trious Convention of all the Princes of the Empire, was nece&s;&s;ary. <HI>Wilmot</HI> pre&s;&s;ed very much for that Character, that he might the more ea&s;ily accompli&s;h his being made an Earl; for which he had obtain'd the King's promi&s;e in a fit &s;ea&s;on. <Q>And he took great pains to per&s;wade the King, &startq;that this was a proper &s;ea&s;on, and very much for the Advancement of his &s;er|vice: but, that if he had the Title of an Earl, which would be look'd upon as a high Qualification, he would not a&s;&s;ume the Character of <MILESTONE N="10"> Emba&s;&s;adour, though he would carry &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion with him, but&endq; make all his Negotiations as a private Envoy;</Q> of which he promi&s;ed the King wonderful Effects, and pretended to have great a&s;&s;urance of Money, and of making Levies of Men for any Expedition. The King, rather to comply with the general expectation, and to do all that was in his power to do, than out of any hope of notable Advantage from this Agitation, was contented to make him Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> and gave <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King makes</HI> Wilmot <HI>Earl of</HI> Ro|che&s;ter; <HI>and &s;ends him to the Diet at</HI> Ratisbone.</NOTE> him all &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions, and Credentials, as were nece&s;&s;ary for the Employment; and &s;ent him from <HI>Paris</HI> in the <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> time, that he <MILESTONE N="20"> might be at <HI>Ratisbone</HI> at the meeting of the Diet, which was to be in the beginning of <HI>April</HI> following; means having been found to procure &s;o much Money as was nece&s;&s;ary for that Journey, out of the A&s;&s;ign|ment that had been made to the King for his &s;upport: of which there was a great Arrear due, and which the Cardinal cau&s;ed at this time to be &s;upplied, becau&s;e he look'd upon this &s;ending to <HI>Ratisbone</HI> as a pre|paratory for the King's own remove.</P>

off that Union, without which nothing could &s;ucceed, his Maje&s;ty, about the time that the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was di&s;patch'd for <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> &s;ent likewi&s;e <HI>Middleton</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> with &s;ome few Officers of that Na|tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Middle+ton <HI>is &s;ent in to</HI> Scotland</NOTE> and &s;uch a poor &s;upply of Armes and Ammunition, as, by the activity and indu&s;try of <HI>Middleton,</HI> could be got upon the credit and contribution of &s;ome Merchants and Officers in <HI>Holland</HI> of that Nation, who were willing to redeem their Country from the Slavery it was in With this very &s;lender A&s;&s;i&s;tance he tran&s;ported him&s;elf in the Winter into the High-lands; where, to welcome him, he found the few, whom he look'd to find in Armes, more broken with Faction among&s;t them|&s;elves <MILESTONE N="10"> than by the Enemy; nor was he able to reconcile them. But af|ter <HI>Glencarne</HI> had deliver'd his thin unarm'd Troops to <HI>Middleton,</HI> and conde&s;cended to fight a duel with an Inferior Officer, who provoked him to it after he was out of his Command, whether he was troubled to have another command over him, who, upon the matter, had no other Men to command but what were rai&s;ed by him, though he had exceedingly pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Middleton</HI>'s being &s;ent over to that purpo&s;e, or whether convinced with the impo&s;&s;ibility of the Attempt, he retired fir&s;t to his own Hou&s;e, and then made his Peace with <HI>Monk,</HI> that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Glencarne <HI>re|tires to his own Hou&s;e; and made his Peace with</HI> Monk</NOTE> might live quietly, and retain'd &s;till his affection and fidelity to the King; <MILESTONE N="20"> which he made manife&s;t afterwards in a more favourable conjuncture: and at the &s;ame time he excu&s;ed him&s;elf to the King, for giving over an Enterprize which he was not able to pro&s;ecute, though <HI>Middleton</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd it a full year afterwards.</P>
<P>THE truth is, the two Per&s;ons who were mo&s;t concern'd in that Ex|pedition, had no degree of hope that it would be attended with any &s;ucce&s;s, the King, and <HI>Middleton;</HI> who had both &s;een an Army of that People, well provided with all things nece&s;&s;ary, not able to do any thing where they fought upon terms more Advantageous. And how could tho&s;e now, drawn together by chance, half arm'd and undi&s;ciplin'd, be <MILESTONE N="3"> able to contend with victorious Troops, which wanted nothing, and would hardly part with what they had got? but his Maje&s;ty could not refu&s;e to give them leave to attempt what they believ'd they could go through with; and <HI>Middleton,</HI> who had promi&s;ed them to come to them, when he was a&s;&s;ured he &s;hould be enabled to carry over with him two thou&s;and Men, and good &s;tore of Armes, thought him&s;elf obliged to venture his Life with them who expected him, though he could carry no more with him than is mention'd; and by his behaviour there, not|with&s;tanding all di&s;couragements, he manife&s;ted how much he would have done, if others had perform'd half their promi&s;es. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>IT will not be ami&s;s in this place to mention an Adventure that was made during his being in the High-lands, which de&s;erves to be recorded for the honour of the Undertakers. There was attending upon the King a young Gentleman, one M^r <HI>Wogan,</HI> a very hand&s;ome Per&s;on, of the age of three or four and twenty. This Gentleman had, when he was a youth of fifteen or &s;ixteen years, been, by the corruption of &s;ome of his neare&s;t Friends, engaged in the Parliament Service again&s;t the King; where the eminency of his courage made him &s;o much taken notice of, that he was of general e&s;timation, and belov'd by all; but &s;o much in the friend&s;hip of <HI>Ireton,</HI> under whom he had the Command of a Troop <MILESTONE N="50"> of Hor&s;e, that no Man was &s;o much in credit with him. By the time of the Murther of the King he was &s;o much improv'd in Age and Un|der&s;tanding, that, by that horrible and impious Murther, and by the
<PB N="396" REF="4100">
information and advice of &s;ober Men in his conver&s;ation, he grew into &s;o great a dete&s;tation of all that People, that he thought of nothing but to repair his own Reputation, by taking vengeance of tho&s;e who had cou&s;en'd and mi&s;led him: and in order thereunto, a&s;&s;oon as the Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond</HI> re&s;um'd the Government of <HI>Ireland</HI> again for the King (which was the only place then where any Armes were borne for his Maje&s;ty) Captain <HI>Wogan</HI> repaired thither to him through <HI>Scotland;</HI> and behaved him&s;elf with &s;uch &s;ignal Valour, that the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> gave him the Command of his own Guards, and every Man the Te&s;ti|mony of de&s;erving it. He came over with the Marquis into <HI>France;</HI> and being re&s;tle&s;s to be in Action, no &s;ooner heard of <HI>Middleton</HI>'s being <MILESTONE N="10"> arriv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> than he re&s;olv'd to find him&s;elf with him; and im|mediately asked the King's leave not only for him&s;elf, but for as many of the young Men about the Court as he could per&s;wade to go with him; <Q>declaring to his Maje&s;ty, &startq;&endq;that he re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s through <HI>Eng|land.</HI></Q> The King, who had much Grace for him, di&s;&s;waded him from the Undertaking, for the difficulty and danger of it, and denied to give him leave. But neither his Maje&s;ty, nor the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> could divert him; and his importunity continuing, he was left to follow his Inclinations: and there was no News &s;o much talked of in the Court, <MILESTONE N="20"> as that Captain <HI>Wogan</HI> would go into <HI>England,</HI> and from thence march into <HI>Scotland</HI> to General <HI>Middleton;</HI> and many young Gentlemen, and others, who were in <HI>Paris,</HI> li&s;ted them&s;elves with him for the Expedi|tion. He went then to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; who, during the time of the King's &s;tay in <HI>France,</HI> executed the Office of Secretary of State, to de&s;ire the di&s;patch of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;es, Letters, and Commi&s;&s;ions, as were nece&s;&s;ary for the Affair he had in hand. <Q>The Chancellor had much kindne&s;s for him, and having heard of his de&s;ign by the common talk of the Court, and from the free di&s;cour&s;es of &s;ome of tho&s;e who re&s;olv'd to go with him, repre&s;ented &startq;the danger of the enterpri&s;e to <MILESTONE N="30"> him&s;elf, and the di&s;honour that would reflect upon the King, for &s;uf|fering Men under his Pa&s;s, and with his Commi&s;&s;ion, to expo&s;e them|&s;elves to inevitable ruin: that it was now the di&s;cour&s;e of the Town, and would without doubt be known in <HI>England</HI> and to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> be|fore he and his Friends could get thither, &s;o that it was likely they would be apprehended the fir&s;t minute they &s;et their foot on Shore; and how much his own particular Per&s;on was more liable to danger&endq; than other Mens he knew well;</Q> and, upon the whole matter, very earne&s;tly di&s;&s;waded him from proceeding farther.</P>
<P>HE an&s;wer'd mo&s;t of the particular con&s;iderations with contempt of <MILESTONE N="40"> the danger, and confidence of going through with it, but with no kind of rea&s;on (a talent that did not then abound in him) to make it appear probable. Whereupon the Chancellor expre&s;sly refu&s;ed to make his Di&s;patches, till he could &s;peak with the King; <Q>&startq;with whom, he &s;aid, he would do the be&s;t he could to per&s;wade his Maje&s;ty to hinder his&endq; journey;</Q> with which the Captain was provoked to &s;o great pa&s;&s;ion, that he broke into tears, and be&s;ought him not to di&s;&s;wade the King; and &s;eem'd &s;o much tran&s;ported with the re&s;olution of the Adventure, as if he would not out live the di&s;appointment. This pa&s;&s;ion &s;o far pre|vailed with the King, that he cau&s;ed all his Di&s;patches to be made, and <MILESTONE N="50"> deliver'd to him. And the very next day He and his Companions, be|ing &s;even or eight in number, went out of <HI>Paris</HI> together, and took Po&s;t for <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="4110">
THEY landed at <HI>Dover,</HI> continued their journey to <HI>London,</HI> and walked the Town; &s;tayed there above three Weeks, till they had bought Hor&s;es, which they quarter'd at Common Inns, and li&s;ted Men enough of their friends and acquaintance to pro&s;ecute their purpo&s;e. And then they appointed their Rendezvous at <HI>Barnet,</HI> marched out of <HI>London</HI> as <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Soldiers, and from <HI>Barnet</HI> were full four&s;core Hor&s;e well armed, and appointed, and quarter'd that night at S^$ <HI>Albans;</HI> and from thence, by ea&s;y journies, but out of the Common Roads, marched &s;afely into <HI>Scotland;</HI> beat up &s;ome Quarters which lay in their way, and without any mi&s;adventure joyn'd <HI>Middleton</HI> in the High-lands; <MILESTONE N="10"> where poor <HI>Wogan,</HI> after many brave Actions perform'd there, receiv'd upon a Party an ordinary fle&s;h wound; which, for want of a good Sur|geon proved mortal to him, to the very great grief of <HI>Middleton,</HI> and all who knew him. Many of the Troopers, when they could &s;tay no longer there, found their way again through <HI>England,</HI> and return'd to the King.</P>
<P>IN the di&s;tre&s;s which the King &s;uffer'd during his abode in <HI>France,</HI> the Chancellor of the Exchequer's part was the mo&s;t unea&s;y and grievous. For though all who were angry with Him, were as angry with the Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who liv'd in great friend&s;hip with him, and was in <MILESTONE N="20"> the &s;ame tru&s;t with the King in all his coun&s;els which were re&s;erv'd from others; yet the Marqui&s;s's Quality, and the great Services he had per|form'd, and the great &s;ufferings he underwent for the Crown, made him above all their exceptions; and they believ'd his aver&s;ion from all their Devices to make marriages, and to traffick in Religion, proceeded mo&s;t from the credit the other had with him. And the Queen's di&s;plea|&s;ure <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen's di&s;plea&s;ure a|gain&s;t the Chancellor of the $Word$ in</HI> France.</NOTE> grew &s;o notorious again&s;t the Chancellor, that after he &s;ound by degrees that &s;he would not &s;peak to him, nor take any notice of him when &s;he &s;aw him, he forbore at la&s;t coming in her pre&s;ence; and for many Months did not &s;ee her face, though he had the honour to lodge in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, the Palace Royal, where both their Maje&s;ties kept <MILESTONE N="30"> their Courts; which encouraged all who de&s;ired to ingratiate them&s;elves with her Maje&s;ty, to expre&s;s a great prejudice to the Chancellor, at lea&s;t to withdraw from his conver&s;ation: and the Queen was not re&s;erv'd in declaring, that &s;he did exceedingly de&s;ire to remove him from the King; which nothing kept him from de&s;iring al&s;o, in &s;o uncomfortable a condition, but the con&s;cience of his duty, and the confidence his Ma|je&s;ty had in his fidelity.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;inclination towards him produced, at one and the &s;ame time, a contrivance of an odd Nature, and a Union between two &s;eem|ingly irreconcilable Factions, the Papi&s;ts and the Presbyterians; which <MILESTONE N="40"> was di&s;cover'd to the King by a fal&s;e brother, before the Chancellor had any intimation of it. The Lord <HI>Balcarris,</HI> with D^$ <HI>Frazier,</HI> and &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Petition in|tended of the</HI> Scoti&s;h <HI>Pre&s;|byterians by</HI> Balcarris <HI>and</HI> Frazier, <HI>that the Chancellor of the Ex$he|quer migh$ be remov'd</HI></NOTE> other <HI>Scots</HI> about the Court, thought them&s;elves enough qualified to undertake in the name of all the Presbyterians; <Q>and cau&s;ed a Petition to be prepared, in which they &s;et out, &startq;that the Presbyterian Party had great Affections to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty, and much power to do it; and that they had many Propo&s;itions, and Advices to offer to his Maje&s;ty, for the Advancement thereof: but that they were di&s;couraged, and hindred from offering the &s;ame, by rea&s;on that his Maje&s;ty entru&s;ted his whole Affairs to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; who was an old <MILESTONE N="50"> known and declared Enemy to all their Party; in whom they could repo&s;e no tru&s;t: and therefore they be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, that He

might be remov'd from his Council, at lea&s;t not be &s;uffer'd to be privy to any thing that &s;hould be propo&s;ed by Them; and they &s;hould then make it appear how ready, and how able they were in a very &s;hort&endq; time to advance his Maje&s;ty's Affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ANOTHER Petition was prepared in the name of his Roman Ca|tholick <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And of the</HI> Roman <HI>Ca|tholicks al&s;o, again&s;t him:</HI></NOTE> Subjects; which &s;aid, &startq;that all his Maje&s;ty's Party which had adher'd to him, were now totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and had, for the mo&s;t part, compounded with his Enemies, and &s;ubmitted to their Govern|ment: that the Church Lands were all &s;old, and the Bi&s;hops dead, except very few, who dur&s;t not exerci&s;e their Function: &s;o that he <MILESTONE N="10"> could expect no more aid from any who were concern'd to &s;upport the Government of the Church as it had been formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed: that by the defeat of Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Party fir&s;t, and then by his Ma|je&s;ty's ill &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and the total reduction of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> afterwards by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> his Maje&s;ty might conclude what greater aid he was to expect from the Presbyterian Party. Nothing therefore remain'd to him of hope for his Re&s;toration, but from the affection of his Roman Catholick Subjects; who, as they would never be wanting as to their Per&s;ons, and their E&s;tates which were left, &s;o they had hope to draw from the Catholick Princes, and the Pope him|&s;elf, <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;uch con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance both in Men and Money, that his Ma|je&s;ty &s;hould owe his Re&s;titution, under the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, to the &s;ole power and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Catholicks. But they had great rea&s;on to fear, that all the&s;e hopes would be ob&s;tructed and render'd of no u&s;e, not only by there being no Per&s;on about his Maje&s;ty in whom the Ca|tholicks could have any confidence, but by rea&s;on that the Per&s;on mo&s;t tru&s;ted by him, and through who&s;e hands all Letters and Di&s;|patches mu&s;t pa&s;s, is a known Enemy to all Catholicks; and therefore they be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, that that Per&s;on, the Chancellor of the Ex|chequer, might be removed from him; whereupon he &s;hould find&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> great benefit to accrue to his Service.</Q> It was concluded among&s;t them, that when the&s;e two Petitions &s;hould be weighed and con&s;ider'd, the Queen would ea&s;ily convince his Maje&s;ty, that a Per&s;on who was &s;o odious to all the Roman Catholicks, from who&s;e Affections his Maje&s;ty had mo&s;t rea&s;on to promi&s;e him&s;elf relief, and to all the Prote&s;tants who could contribute to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, could not be fit to be continued in any Tru&s;t about him.</P>
<P>WHEN matters were thus adju&s;ted, which were the longer in pre|paration, becau&s;e the Per&s;ons concern'd could not, without &s;u&s;picion and &s;candal, meet together, but were to be treated with by Per&s;ons mu|tually employed, one M^r <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> a Per&s;on very well known to all <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The de&s;ign di&s;|cover'd by one M^r</HI> Wallin|gham, <HI>to the King; which qua$$$d them both.</HI></NOTE> Men who at that time knew the Palace Royal, who had been employed in the affair, came to the King, and, whether out of ingenuity, and di&s;like of &s;o foul a combination, or as he thought the di&s;covery would be grateful to his Maje&s;ty, informed him of the whole Intrigue, and gave a Copy of the Petitions to the King; who &s;hew'd them to the Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and inform'd them of the whole De&s;ign. And from this time his Maje&s;ty made him|&s;elf very merry with it, and &s;poke of it &s;ometimes at dinner, when the Queen was pre&s;ent; <Q>and asked plea&s;antly, &startq;when the two Petitions&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> would be brought again&s;t the Chancellor of the Exchequer?</Q> which be|ing quickly known to &s;ome of the Per&s;ons engaged in the pro&s;ecution, they gave it over, and thought not fit to proceed any farther in it;

though both Parties continued their implacable malice towards him, nor did he find any ea&s;e or quiet by their giving over that de&s;ign, their Animo&s;ities again&s;t him &s;till breaking out one after another, as long as the King remain'd in <HI>France;</HI> the Queen taking all occa&s;ions to complain to the Queen Regent of the King's unkindne&s;s, that &s;he might impute all that &s;he di&s;liked to the Chancellor; and the Queen Mother of <HI>France</HI> was like to be very tender in a point that &s;o much concern'd her &s;elf, that any Man &s;hould dare to interpo&s;e between the Mother and the Son.</P>
<P>THERE was an accident fell out, that admini&s;ter'd &s;ome argument <MILESTONE N="10"> to make tho&s;e Complaints appear more rea&s;onable. The Cardinal <HI>de Retz</HI> had allways expre&s;&s;ed great civilities towards the King, and a de|&s;ire to &s;erve him; and upon &s;ome occa&s;ional conference between them, the Cardinal ask'd the King, <Q>&startq;whether he had made any attempt to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A di&s;cour&s;e of the King's with Cardinal</HI> de Retz.</NOTE> draw any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Pope, and whether he thought that no|thing might be done that way to his advantage? The King told him, nothing had been attempted that way; and that He was better able to judge, whether the Pope was like to do any thing for a Man of His&endq; Faith.</Q> <Q>The Cardinal &s;miling, &s;aid, &startq;he had no thought of &s;peaking of his Faith; yet in &s;hort, he &s;poke to him like a wi&s;e and hone&s;t Man; <MILESTONE N="20"> that if any Overtures were made him of the change of his Religion, he mu&s;t tell his Maje&s;ty, it becomes him as a Cardinal to wi&s;h his Ma|je&s;ty a Catholick for the &s;aving his Soul; but he mu&s;t declare too, that if he did change his Religion, he would never be re&s;tored to his King|doms.&endq;</Q> But he &s;aid, he did believe (though the Pope was old, and much decay'd in his genero&s;ity; <Q>for <HI>Innocent</HI> the 10^t^h was then living) &startq;that if &s;ome proper Application was made to the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> and to the Pope him&s;elf, though there would not be gotten wherewithal to rai&s;e and maintain Armies, there might be &s;omewhat con&s;iderable ob|tain'd for his more plea&s;ant Support, wherever he &s;hould choo&s;e to&endq; re&s;ide.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he had him&s;elf &s;ome Alliance with the Great Duke, <MILESTONE N="30"> and intere&s;t in other Courts, and in <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, and if his Maje&s;ty would give him leave, and tru&s;t his di&s;cretion, he would write in &s;uch a manner in his own Name to &s;ome of his friends, as &s;hould not be of&endq; any prejudice to his Maje&s;ty if it brought him no convenience.</Q> The King had rea&s;on to acknowledge the obligation, and to leave it to his own wi&s;dom, what he would do. In the conclu&s;ion of the di&s;cour&s;e, the Cardinal ask'd his Maje&s;ty a que&s;tion or two of matter of fact, which he could not an&s;wer; <Q>but told him, &startq;he would give a punctual infor|mation&endq; of it the next day in a Letter:</Q> which the Cardinal de&s;ired might <MILESTONE N="40"> be a&s;&s;oon as his Maje&s;ty thought fit, becau&s;e he would, upon the receipt of it, make his di&s;patches into <HI>Italy.</HI> The particular things being out of the King's Memory, a&s;&s;oon as he return'd, he ask'd the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerning them; and having receiv'd a punctual Ac|count from him, his Maje&s;ty writ a Letter the next day to the Cardinal, and gave him information as to tho&s;e particulars. Within very few days after this, the Cardinal coming one day to the <HI>Louvre</HI> to &s;ee the Queen Mother, he was arre&s;ted by the Captain of the Guard, and &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cardinal</HI> de Re$$ <HI>$Word$ to the</HI> Pa&s;tile</NOTE> Pri&s;oner to the <HI>Ba&s;lile;</HI> and in one of his Pockets, which they &s;earch'd, that Letter the King had &s;ent to him was found, and deliver'd to the <MILESTONE N="50"> Queen Regent; who pre&s;ently imparted it to the Queen of <HI>England;</HI> and after they had made them&s;elves merry with &s;ome improprieties in the <HI>French,</HI> the King having, for the &s;ecrecy, not con&s;ulted with any

body, they di&s;cover'd &s;ome purpo&s;e of applying to the Pope, and to other Catholick Princes; and that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould enter upon any &s;uch Coun|&s;el, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting with the Queen his Mother, could proceed only from the in&s;tigation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>HER Maje&s;ty, with a very great proportion of &s;harpne&s;s, reproach'd the King for his Neglect, and gave him his Letter. The King was exceed|ingly &s;en&s;ible of the little re&s;pect the Queen Mother had &s;hew'd towards him, in communicating his Letter in that manner to his Mother; and expo&s;tulated with her for it; and took that occa&s;ion to enlarge more upon the inju&s;tice of his Mother's complaints, than he had ever done. And from that time the Queen Mother, who was in truth a very worthy <MILESTONE N="10"> Lady, &s;hew'd much more kindne&s;s to the King. And a little time after, there being a Ma&s;que at the Court that the King liked very well, he per&s;waded the Chancellor to &s;ee it; and vouch&s;afed, the next night, to carry him thither him&s;elf, and to place the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> and Him next the Seat where all their Maje&s;ties were to &s;it. <Q>And when they enter'd, the Queen Regent ask'd, &startq;who that fat Man was who &s;ate by&endq; the Marquis of <HI>Ormond?</HI></Q> <Q>The King told her aloud, &startq;that was the naughty Man who did all the Mi&s;chief, and &s;et him again&s;t his Mo|ther:&endq;</Q> at which the Queen her &s;elf was little le&s;s di&s;order'd than the Chancellor was. But they within hearing laugh'd &s;o much, that the <MILESTONE N="20"> Queen was not di&s;plea&s;ed; and &s;omewhat was &s;poken to his Advantage, whom few thought to de&s;erve the Reproach.</P>
<P><Q>AT this time the King was inform'd by the <HI>French</HI> Court, &startq;that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>with his Fleet arrives at</HI> Nantes.</NOTE> Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who had been &s;o long ab&s;ent, having gone with the Fleet from <HI>Holland</HI> before the Murther of the late King, and had not been heard of in &s;ome years, was now upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;oon after at <HI>Nantes</HI> in the Province of <HI>Britain,</HI> with the <HI>Swallow,</HI> a Ship of the King's, and with three or four other Ships; and that the <HI>Con&s;tant Reformation,</HI> another Ship of the King's, in which Prince <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Maurice</HI> had been; was ca&s;t away in the <HI>Indies</HI> near two years before;&endq; and that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> him&s;elf was return'd with very ill health.</Q> The King &s;ent pre&s;ently to welcome him, and to invite him to <HI>Paris</HI> to at|tend his health; and his Maje&s;ty pre&s;umed that, by the Arrival of this Fleet, which he thought mu&s;t be very rich, he &s;hould receive &s;ome Mo|ney, that would enable him to remove out of <HI>France;</HI> of which He was as weary as It was of Him.</P>
<P>GREAT Expectation was rai&s;ed in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, that there would be &s;ome notable change upon the Arrival of this Prince; and though he had profe&s;&s;ed much kindne&s;s to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when <MILESTONE N="40"> he parted from <HI>Holland,</HI> yet there was hope that he would not appear now his Friend, the rather for that he had left <HI>Ireland</HI> with &s;ome de|clared unkindne&s;s towards the Marquis of <HI>Ormond.</HI> And all Men knew that the Atturney General, who was un&s;atisfied with every body, would have mo&s;t influence upon that Prince; and that his Highne&s;s could not be without credit enough with the King to introduce him into bu&s;ine&s;s; which they thought would at lea&s;t le&s;&s;en the Chancellor. In order to which, it was no &s;ooner known that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was landed in <HI>France,</HI> but the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> vi&s;ited, and made great court to S^r <HI>Edward Her|bert;</HI> between whom and him there had been greater &s;hew of Animo&s;ity <MILESTONE N="50"> than between any two of the Nation who were beyond the Seas, they having for &s;ome years &s;eldom &s;poken to, never well of, each other. And <HI>Herbert,</HI> who was of a rough and proud nature, had declared publickly,
<Q><PB N="401" REF="4150">
&startq;that he would have no friend&s;hip with any Man who believ'd the other&endq; to be an hone&s;t Man.</Q> Between the&s;e two a great friend&s;hip is &s;uddain|ly made; and the Atturney is every day with the Queen, who had &s;hew'd a greater Aver&s;ion from him than from any Man, not only upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> but upon many other Occa&s;ions. <Q>But now &s;he commended him to the King, &startq;as a wi&s;e Man, of great Expe|rience,&endq; and of great Intere&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM the death of S^r <HI>Richard Lane,</HI> who had been Keeper of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother moves the King to make</HI> Herbert <HI>Lord Keeper; and he is made.</HI></NOTE> Great Seal under his late Maje&s;ty, there had not only been no Officer in that place, but, from the defeat at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> the King had been without <MILESTONE N="10"> any Great Seal, it having been there lo&s;t. But he had lately imploy'd a Graver to prepare a Great Seal; which he kept him&s;elf, not intending to confer that Office, whil&s;t he remain'd abroad. But now the Queen pre&s;&s;ed the King very earne&s;tly, to make the Atturney General Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; which was a promotion very natural, Men or|dinarily ri&s;ing from the one Office to the other. The King knew the Man very well, and had neither e&s;teem nor kindne&s;s for him; yet he well fore&s;aw, that when Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came to him, he &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed both by his Mother and Him &s;o importunately, that he &s;hould not with any ea&s;e be able to refu&s;e it. Then he believ'd that, if the Man him|&s;elf <MILESTONE N="20"> were in good humour, he would be of great u&s;e in compo&s;ing any ill humour that &s;hould ari&s;e in the Prince; to which it was apprehended he might be apt to be inclined. And therefore his Maje&s;ty thought it be&s;t (&s;ince no body di&s;&s;waded him from the Thing) to oblige him frankly him&s;elf before the Prince came; and &s;o call'd him to his Council, and made him Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; with which he &s;eem'd won|derfully delighted; and for &s;ome time liv'd well towards every Body; though, as to any thing of bu&s;ine&s;s, he appear'd only in his old excellent faculty of rai&s;ing doubts, and objecting again&s;t any thing that was pro|po&s;ed, and propo&s;ing nothing him&s;elf; which was a temper of Under|&s;tanding <MILESTONE N="30"> he could not rectify, and, in the pre&s;ent State of Affairs, did le&s;s mi&s;chief than it would have done in a time when any thing was to have been done.</P>
<P><Q>BEFORE the Prince came to <HI>Paris</HI> he gave the King &s;uch an Ac|count, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>gives an ill Account of his Fleet.</HI></NOTE> as made it evident that his Maje&s;ty was to expect no Money: &startq;that what Trea&s;ure had been gotten together, which, he confe&s;&s;ed, had amounted to great value, had been all lo&s;t in the Ship in which&endq; him&s;elf was (that &s;prung a plank in the <HI>Indies,</HI></Q> <Q>when his Highne&s;s was miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erv'd) &startq;and, in the Boat, carried to another Ship, when that the <HI>Antelope,</HI> with all the Men, and all that had been got|ten, <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;unk in the Sea; and that much of the other purcha&s;e had been&endq; likewi&s;e ca&s;t away in the Ship in which his Brother peri&s;h'd;</Q> which was after his own misfortune: &s;o that all that was brought into <HI>Nantes,</HI> would &s;carce pay off the Seamen, and di&s;charge &s;ome debts at <HI>Toulon,</HI> which the Prince had contracted at his former being there, during the time that the King had been in <HI>Holland:</HI> <Q>And &startq;that the Ships were all &s;o eaten with worms, even the <HI>Swallow</HI> it &s;elf, that there was no po&s;&s;i|bility&endq; of &s;etting them out again to Sea.</Q> This was all the Account the King could receive of that whole Affair, when the Prince him&s;elf came to <HI>Paris;</HI> with which though the King was not &s;atisfied, yet he knew <MILESTONE N="50"> not how to remedy it, the Prince taking it very ill that any Account &s;hould be required of him; and the Keeper quickly per&s;waded his High|ne&s;s, that it was only the Chancellor of the Exchequer's influence, that
<PB N="402" REF="4160">
di&s;po&s;ed the King with &s;o much &s;trictne&s;s to examine his Account.</P>
<P>THERE was another de&s;ign now &s;et on foot, by which they con|cluded <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Affair concerning M^r</HI> Long; <HI>who petitions the King to be re|&s;tored to the Secretary's Place:</HI></NOTE> they &s;hould &s;ufficiently mortify the Chancellor; who, they thought, had &s;till too much credit with his Ma&s;ter. When the King went into <HI>Scotland,</HI> M^r <HI>Robert Long,</HI> who hath been mention'd before, was Secretary of State; who, having been allways a creature of the Queen's, and dependent upon the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> had &s;o behaved him&s;elf towards them, during his &s;hort &s;tay in <HI>Scotland</HI> (for he was one of tho&s;e who was remov'd from the King there, and &s;ent out of that Kingdom) that when his Maje&s;ty return'd from <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> they would <MILESTONE N="10"> by no means &s;uffer that he &s;hould wait upon his Maje&s;ty; and accu&s;ed him of much breach of tru&s;t, and di&s;hone&s;ty, and, among&s;t the re&s;t, that he &s;hould &s;ay, which could be prov'd, <Q>&startq;that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any Man to &s;erve the King hone&s;tly, and to pre&s;erve the good opinion of&endq; the Queen, and keep the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI>'s favour.</Q> The truth is, that Gentleman had not the good fortune to be generally well thought of, and the King did not believe him faultle&s;s; and therefore was contented to &s;atisfy his Mother, and would not permit him to execute his Office, or to attend in his Councils. Whereupon he left the Court, and lived privately at <HI>Roan;</HI> which was the rea&s;on that the Chancellor had been commanded to execute that place, which intitled him to &s;o much trou|ble. <MILESTONE N="20"> Upon this conjunction between the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> and the Keeper, the la&s;t of whom had in all times inveighed again&s;t M^r <HI>Long</HI>'s want of fidelity, they agreed, that there could not be a better expedient found out to le&s;&s;en the Chancellor's credit, than by re&s;toring <HI>Long</HI> to the exe|cution of the Secretary's Function. <Q>Whereupon they &s;ent for him, and advi&s;ed him to prepare a Petition to the King, &startq;that he might be again re&s;tored to his Office and Attendance, or that he might be charged with his Crimes, and be farther puni&s;h'd, if he did not clear him&s;elf,&endq; and appear innocent.</Q> This Petition was pre&s;ented to the King, when he was in Council, by the Queen; who came thither only for that pur|po&s;e, <MILESTONE N="30"> and de&s;ired that it might be read; which being done, the King was &s;urpri&s;ed, having not in the lea&s;t receiv'd any notice of it; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;that her Maje&s;ty was the principal cau&s;e that induced his Maje&s;ty to remove him from his place, and that &s;he then believ'd that he was&endq; not fit for the Tru&s;t.</Q> <Q>She &s;aid, &startq;&s;he had now a better opinion of him,&endq; and that &s;he had been mi&s;inform'd.</Q> The King thought it unfit to re|ceive <NOTE PLACE="marg">is refu&s;ed by the King.</NOTE> a Per&s;on into &s;o near a Tru&s;t, again&s;t who&s;e fidelity there had been &s;uch publick exceptions; and his Maje&s;ty knew that few of his Friends in <HI>England</HI> would corre&s;pond with him; and therefore would not be <MILESTONE N="40"> per&s;waded to re&s;tore him. This was again put all upon the Chancellor's Account, and the influence He had upon the King.</P>
<P>THEREUPON M^r <HI>Long</HI> accu&s;ed the Chancellor of having betray'd the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whereupon M^r</HI> Long <HI>ac|cu&s;es the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer of his having been in</HI> Eng|land, <HI>and con|ver&s;ed with</HI> Cromwell.</NOTE> King; and undertook to prove that he had been over in <HI>England,</HI> and had private conference with <HI>Cromwell:</HI> which was an a&s;per&s;ion &s;o im|po&s;&s;ible, that every body laugh'd at it: <Q>yet becau&s;e he undertook to prove it, the Chancellor pre&s;&s;ed &startq;that a day might be appointed for&endq; him to produce his proof:</Q> and at that day, the Queen came again to the Council, that &s;he might be pre&s;ent at the Charge.

The Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as he was gone, &s;aid, he never thought the Accu&s;ation had any thing of probability in it; and that he believ'd the Chancellor a very hone&s;t Man; but the u&s;e that he thought ought to be made of this Calumny, was, that it appear'd that an hone&s;t and innocent Man might be calumniated, as he thought M^r <HI>Long</HI> had likewi&s;e been; and therefore they ought both to be&endq; clear'd.</Q> <Q>The Keeper &s;aid, &startq;he &s;aw not ground enough to condemn the Chancellor; but he &s;aw no cau&s;e neither to declare him innocent: that there was one Witne&s;s which declared only what he had heard; <MILESTONE N="30"> but that he undertook al&s;o to produce the Witne&s;s her &s;elf if he might have time; which in ju&s;tice could not be denied; and therefore he propo&s;ed, that a competent time might be given to M^r <HI>Long</HI> to make out his proof; and that in the mean time the Chancellor might not&endq; repair to the Council:</Q> <Q>with which Propo&s;ition the King was &s;o of|fended, that, with much warmth, he &s;aid, &startq;he di&s;cern'd well the de&s;ign; and that it was &s;o fal&s;e and wicked a Charge, that, if he had no other exception again&s;t M^r <HI>Long</HI> than this foul and fooli&s;h Accu&s;ation, it was&endq; cau&s;e enough never to tru&s;t him.</Q> <Q>And therefore he pre&s;ently &s;ent for the Chancellor, and a&s;&s;oon as he came in, commanded him to &s;it in his place; and told him, &startq;he was &s;orry he was not in a condition to do&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> him more Ju&s;tice than to declare him innocent;</Q> which he did do, and commanded the Clerk of the Council to draw up a full Order for his <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ac|quits the Chancellor.</NOTE> Vindication, which his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf would &s;ign.</P>

But, that it was generally believ'd, that he, the Chancellor, had no mind that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould put him&s;elf into Action, but was rather for &s;itting &s;till; and therefore it concern'd him, for his own ju&s;tification, to per&s;wade the King to be Active, and to leave <HI>France,</HI> where he could not but ob&s;erve that <MILESTONE N="20"> every body was weary of him. To all which the Chancellor took great pains to purge him&s;elf from being in the fault; and &s;aid, that no body could think that he could take delight to &s;tay in a place where he was &s;o ill u&s;ed; but laid all the fault upon the King; who, he &s;aid, was indi&s;po&s;ed to bu&s;ine&s;s, and took too much delight in plea&s;ures, and did not love to take pains; for which he was heartily &s;orry, but could&endq; not help it;</Q> <Q>which <HI>Gerard</HI> &s;aid, &startq;he thought was a great reproach and &s;candal upon the King, from a Man &s;o obliged and tru&s;ted, who&endq; ought not to a&s;per&s;e his Ma&s;ter in that manner.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P><Q>THE Chancellor was a little out of countenance; and &s;aid, &startq;he did <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor's Defence.</NOTE> not expect that Accu&s;ation from Any body, le&s;s that the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> &s;hould di&s;cover any private di&s;cour&s;e that had pa&s;&s;ed a year before between them two, and which appear'd by his relation to have been introduced by him&s;elf, and by his own freedom: that who&s;oever be|liev'd that he had a mind to traduce the King, would never believe that he would have cho&s;en the Lord <HI>Gerard,</HI> who was known to be&endq; none of his Friend, to have communicated it to.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he did very well remember, that the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> did, at that time when they two remain'd alone in the Coach, very pa&s;&s;ionately cen&s;ure the <MILESTONE N="40"> King's not being Active, and blamed him, the Chancellor, for not per|&s;wading his Maje&s;ty to put him&s;elf into Action; and that He was ge|nerally believ'd to be in the fault: upon which he had asked him, what he did intend by being Active, and what that Action was, and where, to which he wi&s;h'd the King &s;hould be per&s;waded? He an&s;wer'd, with an increa&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, and addition of Oaths, that rather than &s;it &s;till in <HI>France,</HI> his Maje&s;ty ought to go to every Court in <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> that in&s;tead of &s;ending an Emba&s;&s;adour who was not fit for any bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he &s;hould have gone him&s;elf to the Diet at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> and &s;olli|cited his own bu&s;ine&s;s: which would have been more effectual; and <MILESTONE N="50"> that, if he could not find any other way to put him&s;elf into Action, he ought to go into the High-lands of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Middleton,</HI> and there&endq; try his Fortune.</Q> To all which the Chancellor &s;aid, he did remember

But from that time there were no farther publick Attempts again&s;t the Chancellor, during the time of his Maje&s;ty's abode in <HI>France.</HI> But it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to in&s;ert in this place, that, after the King's return into <HI>England,</HI> there came the Woman to the Chancellor, who had been carried over to <HI>Roan</HI> by <HI>Ma&s;&s;onet,</HI> and importuned by M^r <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Long</HI> to te&s;tify that &s;he had &s;een the Chancellor with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> for which &s;he &s;hould have a pre&s;ent liberal reward in Money from him, and a good Service at <HI>Paris;</HI> which when the Woman refu&s;ed to do, he gave her Money for her journey back, and &s;o &s;he return'd: of which the Chancellor inform'd the King.

<P>THE King wearied with the&s;e dome&s;tick Vexations, as well as with the unea&s;ine&s;s of his Entertainment, and the change he every day di&s;|cover'd <MILESTONE N="40"> in the countenance of the <HI>French</HI> Court to him, grew very im|patient to leave <HI>France;</HI> and though he was totally di&s;appointed of the expectation he had to receive Money by the Return of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with that Fleet, he hoped that when the Prizes &s;hould be &s;old, and all the Seamen di&s;charged, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> be &s;atisfied his demands, which were very large, there would be &s;till left the Ships, and Ordnance, and Tackling, which (though they required great Charge to be fitted out again to Sea, yet) if &s;old, he pre&s;umed, would yield a good Sum of Money to enable him to remove, and &s;upport him &s;ome time after he was remov'd; for there were, be&s;ides the Ship it &s;elf, fifty good Bra&s;s <MILESTONE N="50"> Guns on board the <HI>Swallow,</HI> which were very valuable.

<P>THE Prince apprehended, that this unexpected re&s;traint proceeded from &s;ome claim and demand from <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and then expected, that it would likewi&s;e relate to the <HI>Swallow</HI> it &s;elf, if not to the other Ships; and the Mar&s;hal contributed to, and cheri&s;hed this Jealou&s;y, that the better Markets might be made of all the re&s;t; him&s;elf being allways a &s;harer with the Merchants, who made any purcha&s;es of that kind: as he had, from the time that his Highne&s;s fir&s;t came into that Port, all|ways in&s;inuated into him in confidence, and under great good will and <MILESTONE N="20"> tru&s;t, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould u&s;e all expedition in the &s;ale of the Prizes, le&s;t either <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;hould demand the whole (which he much doubted) or that the Merchants, Owners of the Goods, &s;hould upon the hearing where they were, &s;end and arre&s;t the &s;aid Ships and Goods, and de|mand re&s;titution to be made of them in a cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice; in either&endq; of which ca&s;es,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he did not know, con&s;idering how things &s;tood with <HI>England,</HI> what the Court would determine: though, he promi&s;ed, he would extend his Authority to &s;erve the Prince, as far as he could with his own &s;afety; and defer the publi&s;hing and exe|cution of any Orders he &s;hould receive, till the Prince might facili|tate&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> the di&s;patch:</Q> and by this kind Advice very good Bargains had been made for tho&s;e Goods which had been &s;old; of which the Mar|&s;hal had an Account to his own de&s;ire.</P>
<P>BUT when, upon this unwelcome Adverti&s;ement, the King made his Addre&s;s to the Cardinal to revoke this Order; and, as the be&s;t rea|&s;on to oblige him to gratify him, told him, <Q>&startq;that the Money, which &s;hould be rai&s;ed upon the Sale of tho&s;e Cannon, was the only means he had to remove him&s;elf out of <HI>France,</HI> which he intended &s;hortly to do, and to go to the hither parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and that his Si&s;ter, the <MILESTONE N="40"> Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> and He, had &s;ome thoughts of finding them&s;elves&endq; together,</Q> in the beginning of the Summer, at the <HI>Spaw:</HI> which in|deed had newly enter'd into the King's con&s;ideration, and had been en|tertain'd by the Prince&s;s Royal; the Cardinal, being well plea&s;ed with the rea&s;on, told his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that this Order was not newly made, but had been very Ancient, that no Merchants or any private Subjects, &s;hould buy any Bra&s;s Ordnance in any Port, le&s;t ill u&s;e might be made of them; and that the Order was not now reviv'd with any purpo&s;e to bring any prejudice to his Maje&s;ty; who &s;hould be no lo&s;er by the re&s;traint; for that him&s;elf would buy the Ordnance, and give as much <MILESTONE N="50"> for them as they were worth; in order to which, he would forthwith &s;end an Agent to <HI>Nantes</HI> to &s;ee the Cannon; and, upon conference with a Per&s;on employed by the King, they two &s;hould agree upon the

<P>IT was well for the King that this condition was made for the pay|ment of this Money in <HI>Paris;</HI> for of all the Money paid or receiv'd at <HI>Nantes,</HI> as well for the Ships, Tackle, and Ordnance, as for the Prize-Goods, not one penny ever came to the King's hands, or to his u&s;e, but what he receiv'd at <HI>Paris</HI> from the Cardinal for the Bra&s;s Guns which were upon the <HI>Swallow;</HI> for the valuing whereof the King &s;ent one thi|ther to treat with the Officer of the Cardinal. All the re&s;t was di&s;po&s;ed, <MILESTONE N="10"> as well as receiv'd, by Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> who when he return'd to <HI>Paris,</HI> gave his Maje&s;ty a confu&s;ed Account; <Q>and averr'd, &startq;that the expences had been &s;o great, that there was not only no Money remaining in his&endq; hands, but that there was a debt &s;till due to a Merchant;</Q> which he de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty to promi&s;e to &s;atisfy.</P>
<P>THE King's re&s;olution to go into <HI>Germany</HI> was very grateful to every <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|&s;olves to go in|to</HI> Germany.</NOTE> body, more from the wearine&s;s they had of <HI>France,</HI> than from the fore|&s;ight of any benefit and advantage that was like to accrue by the re|move. But his Maje&s;ty, who needed no &s;purs for that journey, was the more di&s;po&s;ed to it by the extraordinary importunity of his Friends in <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>England;</HI> who ob&s;erving the &s;trict corre&s;pondence that was between the Cardinal and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and knowing that the Allyance between them was very near concluded, and being inform'd that there were con|ditions agreed upon, which were very prejudicial to the King, did really apprehend that his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on might be given up; and thereupon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Harry Sey|mour <HI>&s;ent to the King from his Friends in</HI> England.</NOTE> they &s;ent <HI>Harry Seymour,</HI> who, being of his Maje&s;ty's Bed-chamber, and having his leave to attend his own Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> they well knew would be believ'd by the King, and being addre&s;&s;ed only to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he might have opportunity to &s;peak with the King privately and undi&s;cover'd, <MILESTONE N="30"> and return again with &s;ecurity, as he, and divers Me&s;&s;engers of that kind, frequently did. <Q>He was &s;ent by the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> with the privity of tho&s;e few who were tru&s;ted by them, &startq;to be very importunate with the King, that he would re|move out of <HI>France;</HI> and to communicate to his Maje&s;ty all which they receiv'd from Per&s;ons who were admitted into many of the &s;ecret&endq; re&s;olutions, and purpo&s;es of <HI>Cromwell.</HI></Q> And becau&s;e they well knew in what &s;treights the King was for Money, they found &s;ome means at that time to &s;end him a Supply of about three thou&s;and pounds; which the King receiv'd, and kept with great &s;ecrecy. <Q>They &s;ent him word <MILESTONE N="40"> likewi&s;e, &startq;that wherever he &s;hould choo&s;e to re&s;ide out of <HI>France,</HI> they were confident his Servants in <HI>England,</HI> under what per&s;ecution &s;oe|ver they lay, would &s;end him &s;ome &s;upply: but whil&s;t he remain'd in&endq; <HI>France,</HI> no body would be prevail'd with to &s;end to him.</Q> The King was glad to be confirm'd in the re&s;olution he had taken, by his Friends advice; and that they had in &s;ome degree enabled him to pro&s;ecute it; which was the more valuable, becau&s;e it was known to none. Yet his Debts were &s;o great in <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Servants who were to attend him in &s;o ill a condition, and &s;o without all conveniences for a Journey, that, if the Cardinal, over and above the Money for the Cannon (which <MILESTONE N="50"> the King did not de&s;ire to receive till the la&s;t) did not take care for the payment of all the Arrears, which were due upon the A&s;&s;ignment they had made to him, he &s;hould not be able to make his journey.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="4220">
BUT in this he receiv'd &s;ome ea&s;e quickly; for when the Cardinal was &s;atisfied, that his Maje&s;ty had a full re&s;olution to be gone, which he &s;till doubted, till he heard from <HI>Holland</HI> that the Prince&s;s Royal did really provide for her Journey to the <HI>Spaw,</HI> he did let the King know, <Q>&startq;that, again&s;t the time that his Maje&s;ty appointed his remove, his Ar|rears &s;hould be either entirely paid, or &s;o much of his Debts &s;ecured <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cardinal pays the King all his Arrears from</HI> France.</NOTE> to his Creditors, as &s;hould well &s;atisfy them; and the re&s;t &s;hould be&endq; paid to his Receiver for the charge of the Journey;</Q> <Q>and likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that, for the future, the monthly A&s;&s;ignation &s;hould be punctually paid to whom&s;oever his Maje&s;ty would appoint to receive&endq; it.</Q> This promi&s;e was better comply'd with than any other that had <MILESTONE N="10"> been made, till, &s;ome years after, the King thought fit to decline the receiving thereof; which will be remember'd in it's place.</P>
<P>ALL things being in this &s;tate, the King declared his re&s;olution to be|gin his Journey, a&s;&s;oon as he could put him&s;elf into a capacity of moving, upon the receipt of the Money he expected, and all preparations were made for enabling the family to be ready to wait upon his Maje&s;ty, and for the better regulating, and governing it, when the King &s;hould be out of <HI>France;</HI> there having never been any order taken in it whil&s;t he remain'd there, nor could be, becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty had allways eaten <MILESTONE N="20"> with the Queen, and Her Officers had govern'd the expence; &s;o that by the failing of receiving Money that was promi&s;ed, and by the Queen's Officers receiving all that was paid, to carry on the expence of their Ma|je&s;ties Table, which the King's Servants dur&s;t not enquire into, very few of his Maje&s;ty's Servants had receiv'd any wages from the time of his coming from <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> to the remove he was now to make. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible now to &s;atisfy them what they might in ju&s;tice expect, but they were to be contented with &s;uch a Proportion as could be &s;pared, and which might enable them, without reproach and &s;candal, to leave <HI>Paris</HI> and attend him. They were all mode&s;t in their de&s;ires, hoping that they &s;hould be better provided for in another place. But now the <MILESTONE N="30"> King met with an ob&s;truction, that he lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, from the extra|ordinary narrowne&s;s of the Cardinal's nature, and his over good hu&s;|bandry in bargaining. The Agent he had &s;ent to <HI>Nantes</HI> to view the Cannon, made &s;o many &s;cruples and exceptions upon the price, and upon the weight, that &s;pent much time; and, at la&s;t, offer'd much le&s;s than they were worth, and than the other Merchant had offer'd, when the Injunction came that re&s;train'd him from proceeding. The King knew not what to propo&s;e in this. <Q>The Cardinal &s;aid, &startq;he under&s;tood not the price of Cannon him&s;elf, and therefore he had employ'd a <MILESTONE N="40"> Man that did; and it was rea&s;onable for him to govern him&s;elf by His conduct; who a&s;&s;ured him, that he offer'd as much as they could rea&s;onably be valued at. It was moved on the King's behalf,&endq; that he would permit others to buy them;</Q> which, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he could not do, becau&s;e of the King his Ma&s;ter's re&s;traint; and if any Merchant, or other Per&s;on, &s;hould agree for them, <HI>Cromwell</HI> would demand them wherever they &s;hould be found; and there&endq; were not many that would di&s;pute the Right with Him.</Q> In con|clu&s;ion, the King was compell'd to refer the matter to him&s;elf, and to accept what he was content to pay; and when all was agreed upon <MILESTONE N="50"> according to his own plea&s;ure, he required new abatements in the manner of payment of the Money, all allowance for paying it in Gold, and the like, fitter to be in&s;i&s;ted on by the meane&s;t Merchant, than by

a Member of the &s;acred College, who would be e&s;teem'd a Prince of the Church.</P>
<P>WHILST the King is preparing for his journey to meet the Prince&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condi|tion of</HI> King Charles <HI>the fir&s;t's Children after their Fa+ther's death.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Orange,</HI> it will be fit to look back a little on the condition of the re&s;t of his Brothers and Si&s;ters. After that the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta</HI> had been &s;ecretly convey'd from <HI>Oatlands</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> by the Lady <HI>Moreton</HI> her Governe&s;s, in the year forty &s;ix; and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> in the year forty eight, had made his e&s;cape from S^t <HI>James</HI>'s; where He, and the re&s;t of the Royal Family that remain'd in <HI>England,</HI> were under the care and tuition of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> the Parliament would not <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;uffer, nor did the Earl de&s;ire, that the re&s;t &s;hould remain longer under his Government. But the other two, the Prince&s;s <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> were committed to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> to whom &s;uch an allowance was paid out of the Trea&s;ury, as might well defray their expences with that re&s;pect that was due to their Birth; which was perform'd towards them as long as the King their Father liv'd. But a&s;&s;oon as the King was murther'd, it was order'd that the Children &s;hould be remov'd into the Country, that they might not be the objects of re&s;pect to draw the Eyes and Application of People to|wards them. <Q>The Allowance was retrench'd, that their Attendants and <MILESTONE N="20"> Servants might be le&s;&s;en'd; and order was given, &startq;that they &s;hould be treated without any Addition of Titles, and that they &s;hould &s;it at&endq; their meat as the Children of the family did, and all at one Table.</Q> Whereupon they were remov'd to <HI>Pen&s;hur&s;t,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>'s in <HI>Kent;</HI> where they liv'd under the tuition of the &s;ame Counte&s;s, who ob&s;erv'd the Order of the Parliament with obedience enough: yet they were carefully look'd to, and treated with as much re&s;pect as the Lady pretended &s;he dur&s;t pay to them.</P>
<P>THERE, by an Act of Providence, M^r <HI>Lovel,</HI> an hone&s;t Man, who had been recommended to teach the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> who&s;e Mother <MILESTONE N="30"> was a Daughter of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> became likewi&s;e Tutor to the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter;</HI> who was, by that means, well taught in that learning that was fit for his years, and very well in&s;tructed in the Principles of Religion, and the Duty that he ow'd to the King his Brother: all which made the deeper impre&s;&s;ion in his very pregnant nature, by what his memory retain'd of tho&s;e In&s;tructions which the King his Father had, with much fervour, given him before his death. But &s;hortly after, the Prince&s;s <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> were remov'd from the government of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Leicester,</HI> and &s;ent into the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> to <HI>Carisbrook</HI> Ca&s;tle; where <HI>Mildmay</HI> was Captain; and the care of <MILESTONE N="40"> them committed to him, with an A&s;&s;ignation for their maintenance; which he was to order, and which in truth was given as a boon to him; <Q>and he was required &s;trictly, &startq;that no Per&s;on &s;hould be permitted to ki&s;s their hands, and that they &s;hould not be otherwi&s;e treated than as&endq; the Children of a Gentleman;</Q> which <HI>Mildmay</HI> ob&s;erv'd very exactly; and the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> was not call'd by any other Style than, M^r <HI>Harry.</HI> The Tutor was continued, and &s;ent thither with him; which plea&s;ed him very well. And here they remain'd at lea&s;t two or three years. The Prince&s;s died in this Place; and, according to the Charity of that time towards <HI>Cromwell,</HI> very many would have it believ'd to <MILESTONE N="50"> be by poy&s;on; of which there was no appearance, nor any proof ever after made.</P>
<P>BUT whether this reproach and &s;u&s;picion made any impre&s;&s;ion in the
<PB N="410" REF="4240">
mind of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or whether he had any jealou&s;y that the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> who was now about twelve years of Age, and a Prince of ex|traordinary hopes both from the comline&s;s and gracefulne&s;s of his Per|&s;on, and the vivacity and vigour of his Wit and Under&s;tanding, which made him much &s;poken of, might, at &s;ome time or other, be made u&s;e of by the di&s;contented Party of his own Army to give him trouble, or whether he would &s;hew the contempt he had of the Royal Family, by &s;ending another of it into the world to try his fortune, he did declare one day to the Parliament, <Q>&startq;that he was well content that the Son of the late King, who was then in <HI>Carisbrook</HI> Ca&s;tle, &s;hould have liberty <MILESTONE N="10"> to tran&s;port him&s;elf into any parts beyond the Seas, as he &s;hould de|&s;ire:&endq; which was at that time much wonder'd at, and not believ'd;</Q> and many thought it a pre&s;age of a wor&s;e inclination; and for &s;ome time there was no more &s;peech of it. But notice and advice being &s;ent to the Duke by tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd his Liberty, that he &s;hould pro&s;ecute the ob|taining that Order and Relea&s;e, He, who de&s;ired mo&s;t to be out of re|&s;traint, &s;ent his Tutor, M^r <HI>Lovel,</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> to be advi&s;ed by friends what he &s;hould do to procure &s;uch an Order, and Warrant, as was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his tran&s;portation. And he, by the advice of tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd well to the Affair, did &s;o dextrou&s;ly &s;ollicite it, that he did not only pro|cure an Order from the Parliament that gave him liberty to go over the <MILESTONE N="20"> Seas with the Duke, and to require <HI>Mildmay</HI> to permit him to embark, but likewi&s;e five hundred pounds from the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea|&s;ury, which he receiv'd, to defray the charges and expences of the Voyage; being left to provide a Ship him&s;elf, and being obliged to em|bark at the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> and not to &s;uffer the Duke to go on Shore in any other part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THIS happen'd in the latter end of the year 1652; and was &s;o well pro&s;ecuted, that, &s;oon after, the King receiv'd adverti&s;ement from his Si&s;ter in <HI>Holland,</HI> &startq;that the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> was arriv'd there; and&endq; would be the next day with her;</Q> which was no &s;ooner known than <MILESTONE N="30"> the Queen very earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that he might be pre&s;ently &s;ent for to <HI>Paris,</HI> that &s;he might &s;ee him; which &s;he had never done &s;ince he was about a year old; for within &s;uch a &s;hort time after he was born, the Troubles were &s;o far advanced, that her Maje&s;ty made her voyage into <HI>Holland,</HI> and from that time had never &s;een him. The King could not refu&s;e to &s;atisfy his Mother in &s;o rea&s;onable a de&s;ire, though he did &s;u&s;pect that there might be a farther purpo&s;e in that de&s;ign of &s;eeing him, than was then own'd. And therefore he had di&s;patched pre&s;ently a Me&s;&s;enger to the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his Brother might make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to <HI>Paris.</HI> He was accordingly pre&s;ently &s;ent for, and came &s;afely to <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> to the &s;atisfaction of all who &s;aw him.</P>
<P>NOW all expedition was u&s;ed to provide for the King's remove, &s;o generally de&s;ired of all; and, for the future, the charge of governing the expences of the family, and of payment of the wages of the Servants, and indeed of i&s;&s;uing out all Monies, as well in Journies as when the Court re&s;ided any where, was committed to <HI>Stephen Fox,</HI> a young Man <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Stephen Fox <HI>admitted to manage the King's Money.</HI></NOTE> bred under the &s;evere di&s;cipline of the Lord <HI>Peircy,</HI> now Lord Cham|berlain of the King's Hou&s;hold.

<P>SHORTLY after the Prince was gone, the King begun to think of a day for his own departure, and to make a Li&s;t of his Servants he in|tended &s;hould wait upon him. He fore&s;aw that the only end of his journey was to find &s;ome place where he might &s;ecurely attend &s;uch a Conjuncture, as God Almighty &s;hould give him, that might invite him to new Activity, his pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s being to be quiet; <Q>and therefore he was wont to &s;ay, &startq;that he would provide the be&s;t he could for it,&endq; by having only &s;uch about him as could be quiet.</Q> He could not for|get <MILESTONE N="40"> the vexation the Lord Keeper had allways given him, and how im|po&s;&s;ible it was for him to live ea&s;ily with any body; and &s;o, in the making the Li&s;t of tho&s;e who were to go with him, he left His name out; which the Keeper could not be long without knowing; <Q>and thereupon he came to the King, and asked him, &startq;whether he did not intend that he &s;hould&endq; wait upon him? His Maje&s;ty told him,</Q> <Q>&startq;No; for that he re&s;olv'd to make no u&s;e of his Great Seal; and therefore that he &s;hould &s;tay at <HI>Paris,</HI> and not put him&s;elf to the trouble of &s;uch a Journey, which&endq; he him&s;elf intended to make without the ea&s;e and benefit of a Coach:</Q> which in truth he did, putting his Coach-Hor&s;es in a Waggon, wherein <MILESTONE N="50"> his Bed and Cloaths were carried: nor was he owner of a Coach in &s;ome years after. The Keeper expo&s;tulated with him in vain upon the di&s;|honour that it would be to him to be left behind, and the next day
<PB N="412" REF="4260">
brought the Great Seal, and deliver'd it to him; <Q>and defired that he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord Keeper</HI> Her|bert <HI>re&s;igns his Office to the King.</HI></NOTE> &startq;would &s;ign a Paper, in which his Maje&s;ty acknowledged, that he had&endq; receiv'd again his Great Seal from him;</Q> which the King very willingly &s;ign'd; and He immediately remov'd his Lodging, and left the Court; and never after &s;aw his Maje&s;ty; which did not at all plea&s;e the Queen; who was as much troubled that He was to &s;tay where She was, as that he did not go with the King.</P>
<P>THE Queen prevailed with the King, at parting, in a particular in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen prevails with the King to leave the Duke of</HI> Gloce&s;ter <HI>with her.</HI></NOTE> which he had fortified him&s;elf to deny her, <Q>which was, &startq;that he would&endq; leave the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> with her;</Q> which &s;he asked with &s;o much <MILESTONE N="10"> importunity, that, without very much di&s;obliging her, he could not re&s;i&s;t. <Q>She de&s;ired him &startq;to con&s;ider in what condition he had been bred till he came into <HI>France,</HI> without Learning either exerci&s;e or language, or having ever &s;een a Court, or good Company; and being now in a place, and at an Age, that he might be in&s;tructed in all the&s;e, to carry him away from all the&s;e Advantages to live in <HI>Germany,</HI> would be interpreted by all the world, not only to be want of kindne&s;s towards&endq; his Brother, but want of all manner of re&s;pect to Her.</Q> The rea&s;on|ablene&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, together with the King's utter di&s;ability to &s;upport him in the condition that was fit for him, would ea&s;ily have <MILESTONE N="20"> prevailed, had it not been for the fear that the purpo&s;e was to pervert him in his Religion; <Q>which when the Queen had a&s;&s;ured the King &startq;was not in her thought, and that &s;he would not permit any &s;uch attempt&endq; to be made, his Maje&s;ty con&s;ented to it.</Q></P>
<P>NOW the day being appointed for his Maje&s;ty to begin his Journey, the King de&s;ired that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might likewi&s;e part in the Queen's good grace, at lea&s;t without her notable disfavour, &s;he having been &s;o &s;evere towards him, that he had not for &s;ome Months pre&s;um'd to be in her pre&s;ence: &s;o that though he was very de&s;irous to ki&s;s her Maje&s;ty's hand, he him&s;elf knew not how to make any Advance <MILESTONE N="30"> towards it. But the day before the King was to be gone, the Lord <HI>Peircy,</HI> who was directed by his Maje&s;ty to &s;peak in the Affair, and who in truth had kindne&s;s for the Chancellor, and knew the prejudice again&s;t him to be very unju&s;t, brought him word that the Queen was content to &s;ee him, and that he would accompany him to her in the Afternoon. Ac|cordingly at the hour appointed by her Maje&s;ty, they found her alone <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Upon the King's depar|ture from</HI> France, <HI>the Chancellor of the Exchequer had an Au|dience of the Queen Mo|ther</HI></NOTE> in her private Gallery, and the Lord <HI>Peircy</HI> withdrawing to the other end of the room, the Chancellor told her Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that now &s;he had vouch&s;a&s;ed to admit him into her pre&s;ence, he hoped, &s;he would let him know the ground of the di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he had conceiv'd again&s;t him; <MILESTONE N="40"> that &s;o having vindicated him&s;elf from any fault towards her Maje&s;ty, he might leave her with a confidence in his Duty, and receive her Commands, with an a&s;&s;urance that they &s;hould be punctually obeyed&endq; by him.</Q> <Q>The Queen, with a louder voice, and more emotion than &s;he was accu&s;tom'd to, told him, &startq;that &s;he had been contented to &s;ee him, and to give him leave to ki&s;s her hand, to comply with the King's de&s;ires, who had importuned her to it; otherwi&s;e, that he liv'd in that manner towards her, that he had no rea&s;on to expect to be wel|come to her: that &s;he need not a&s;&s;ign any particular mi&s;carriage of his, &s;ince his di&s;re&s;pect towards her was notorious to all Men; and <MILESTONE N="50"> that all Men took notice, that he never came where &s;he was, though&endq; he lodged under her Roof</Q> (for the Hou&s;e was hers) <Q>&startq;and that &s;he thought &s;he had not &s;een him in &s;ix Months before; which &s;he look'd
<PB N="413" REF="4270">
upon as &s;o high an Affront, that only her re&s;pect towards the King&endq; prevailed with her to endure it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN her Maje&s;ty made a pau&s;e, the Chancellor &s;aid, &startq;that her Maje&s;ty had only mention'd his puni&s;hment, and nothing of his fault: that how great &s;oever his infirmities were in defect of Under&s;tanding, or in good manners, he had yet never been in <HI>Bedlam;</HI> which he had de&s;erv'd to be, if he had affected to publi&s;h to the world that he was in the Queen's disfavour, by avoiding to be &s;een by her: that he had no kind of Apprehen&s;ion that they who thought wor&s;t of him, would ever believe him to be &s;uch a fool, as to provoke the Wife of his dead <MILESTONE N="10"> Ma&s;ter, the greatne&s;s of who&s;e Affections to her was well known to him, and the Mother of the King, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by her favour, and all this in <HI>France,</HI> where him&s;elf was a bani&s;h'd Per&s;on, and &s;he at home, where &s;he might oblige, or di&s;oblige him at her plea&s;ure. So that he was well a&s;&s;ured, that no body would think him guilty of &s;o much folly and madne&s;s, as not to u&s;e all the endeavours he po&s;&s;ibly could to obtain her Grace and Protection: that it was very true, he had been long without the pre&s;umption of being in her Maje&s;ty's pre|&s;ence, after he had undergone many &s;harp In&s;tances of her di&s;plea&s;ure, and after he had ob&s;erv'd &s;ome alteration and aver&s;ion in her Maje&s;ty's <MILESTONE N="20"> looks and countenance, upon his coming into the room where &s;he was, and during the time he &s;tayed there; which others likewi&s;e ob&s;erv'd &s;o much, that they withdrew from holding any conver&s;ation with him in tho&s;e places, out of fear to offend her Maje&s;ty: that he had often de&s;ired, by &s;everal Per&s;ons, to know the cau&s;e of her Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea|&s;ure, and that he might be admitted to clear him&s;elf from any unwor|thy Sugge&s;tions which had been made of him to her Maje&s;ty; but could never obtain that honour; and therefore he had conceiv'd, that he was obliged, in good manners, to remove &s;o unacceptable an ob|ject from the eyes of her Maje&s;ty, by not coming into her pre&s;ence; which all who knew him, could not but know to be the greate&s;t Mor|tification <MILESTONE N="30"> that could be inflicted upon him; and therefore he mo&s;t humbly be&s;ought her Maje&s;ty at this Audience, which might be the la&s;t he &s;hould receive of her, &s;he would di&s;mi&s;s him with the know|ledge of what had been taken ami&s;s, that he might be able to make his innocence and integrity appear; which he knew had been bla&s;ted by the malice of &s;ome Per&s;ons; and thereby mi&s;under&s;tood and mi&s;|interpreted&endq; by her Maje&s;ty.</Q> But all this prevailed not with her Ma|je&s;ty; who, after &s;he had, with her former pa&s;&s;ion, objected his credit with the King, and his endeavours to le&s;&s;en that credit which &s;he ought to have, concluded, <Q>&startq;that &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee rea&s;on to change&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> her opinion; and &s;o, carele&s;sly, extended her hand towards him;</Q> which he ki&s;&s;ing, her Maje&s;ty departed to her Chamber.</P>
<P>IT was about the beginning of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1654, that the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King left</HI> Paris <HI>in</HI> June 1654.</NOTE> left <HI>Paris;</HI> and becau&s;e he made a private journey the fir&s;t night, and did not joyn his Family till the next day, which admini&s;ter'd much oc|ca&s;ion of di&s;cour&s;e, and gave occa&s;ion to a bold Per&s;on to publi&s;h, among&s;t the Amours of the <HI>French</HI> Court, a particular that reflected upon the Per&s;on of the King, though with le&s;s Licence than he u&s;ed towards his own Sovereign, it will not be ami&s;s in this place to mention <MILESTONE N="50"> a pre&s;ervation God then wrought for the King, that was none of the lea&s;t of his Mercies vouch&s;afed to him; and which &s;hews the wonder|ful Liberty that was then taken by &s;ome near him, to promote their
<PB N="414" REF="4280">
own de&s;igns, and projects, at the price of their Ma&s;ter's Honour, and the Intere&s;t of their Country, or the Sen&s;e they had of that Honour and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE was at that time in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> or rather in the jealou&s;y of that Court, a Lady of great beauty, of a pre&s;ence very grace|ful and alluring, and a wit and behaviour that captivated tho&s;e who were admitted into her pre&s;ence; her extraction was very noble, and her alliance the be&s;t under the Crown, her fortune rather competent, than abounding, for her degree; being the Widow of a Duke of an il|lu&s;trious Name, who had been kill'd fighting for the King in the late <MILESTONE N="10"> Troubles, and left his Wife childle&s;s, and in her full Beauty. The King had often &s;een this Lady with that e&s;teem, and inclination, which few were without, both her Beauty and her Wit de&s;erving the homage that was paid to her. The Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who was then a Lieutenant Ge|neral in the <HI>French</HI> Army, and allways amorou&s;ly inclined, and the more inclined by the difficulty of the attempt, was grown powerfully in love with this Lady; and to have the more power with her, com|municated tho&s;e Secrets of State which concern'd her &s;afety, and more the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> who&s;e Cou&s;in German &s;he was; the communica|tion whereof was of benefit, or convenience to both: yet though he <MILESTONE N="20"> made many Romantick Attempts to ingratiate him&s;elf with her, and &s;uch as would neither have become, or been &s;afe to any other Man than him&s;elf, who was accu&s;tom'd to extraordinary flights in the Air, he could not arrive at the high &s;ucce&s;s he propo&s;ed. At the &s;ame time, the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> was tran&s;ported with the &s;ame ambition; and though his parts were very different from the others, yet he wanted not art and addre&s;s to encourage him in tho&s;e Attempts, and could bear re|pul&s;es with more tranquillity of mind, and acquie&s;cence, than the other could. When the&s;e two Lords had lamented to each other their mu|tual infelicity, they agreed generou&s;ly to merit their Mi&s;tre&s;s's favour by doing her a Service that &s;hould de&s;erve it; and boldly propo&s;ed to <MILESTONE N="30"> her the Marriage of the King; who, they both knew, had no di&s;like of her Per&s;on: and they pur&s;ued it with his Maje&s;ty with all their Ar|tifices. <Q>They added the reputation of her Wi&s;dom and Virtue to that of her Beauty, and &startq;that &s;he might be in&s;trumental to the procuring more Friends towards his Re&s;toration, than any other Expedient then&endq; in view;</Q> and at la&s;t prevailed &s;o far with the King, who no doubt had a perfect E&s;teem of her, that he made the Overture to her of Mar|riage; <Q>which &s;he receiv'd with her natural mode&s;ty and addre&s;s, de|claring her &s;elf &startq;&endq;to be much unworthy of that Grace;</Q> <Q>and be&s;eeching <MILESTONE N="40"> and advi&s;ing him &startq;to pre&s;erve that affection and inclination for an ob|ject more equal to him, and more capable to contribute to his Ser|vice;&endq;</Q> u&s;ing all tho&s;e Arguments for refu&s;al, which might prevail with and enflame him to new importunities.</P>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e Lords made them&s;elves, upon this Advance, &s;ure to go through with their de&s;ign, yet they fore&s;aw many ob&s;tructions in the way. The Queen, they knew, would never con&s;ent to it, and the <HI>French</HI> Court would ob&s;truct it, as they had done that of <HI>Made|moi&s;elle;</HI> nor could they per&s;wade the Lady her &s;elf to depart from her dignity, and to u&s;e any of tho&s;e arts which might expedite the de|&s;ign. <MILESTONE N="50"> The Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> therefore, that the News might not come to his friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer by other hands, frankly im|parted it to him, only as a pa&s;&s;ion of the King's that had exceedingly
<PB N="415" REF="4290">
tran&s;ported him; and then magnified the Lady, <Q>&startq;as a Per&s;on that would exceedingly cultivate the King's nature, and render him much more&endq; dextrous to advance his Fortune:</Q> <Q>and therefore he profe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that he&endq; would not di&s;&s;wade his Maje&s;ty from gratifying &s;o noble an affection;</Q> and u&s;ed many Arguments to per&s;wade the Chancellor too to think very well of the choice. But when he found that he was &s;o far from con|curring with him, that he reproach'd his great pre&s;umption for inter|po&s;ing in an Affair of &s;o delicate a nature, as by his conduct might prove the ruin of the King, he &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute it no farther, but to leave it entirely to the King's own Inclination; who, upon &s;erious reflexions upon his own condition, and conference with tho&s;e he tru&s;ted <MILESTONE N="10"> mo&s;t, quicly concluded that &s;uch a Marriage was not like to yield much advantage to his Cau&s;e; and &s;o re&s;olv'd to decline any farther advance towards it. Yet the &s;ame Per&s;ons per&s;waded him, that it was a nece&s;&s;ary genero&s;ity to take his la&s;t farewel of her; and &s;o, after he had taken leave of his Mother, he went &s;o much out of his way as to vi&s;it her at her Hou&s;e; where tho&s;e Lords made their la&s;t effort; and his Maje&s;ty, with great e&s;teem of the Lady's virtue, and wi&s;dom, the next day joyn'd his Family, and pro&s;ecuted his Journey towards <HI>Flanders;</HI> his &s;mall &s;tep out of the way, having rai&s;ed a confident rumour in <HI>Paris</HI> that he was married to that Lady. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE King had receiv'd a Pa&s;s from the Arch-Duke, for his pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Flanders,</HI> &s;o warily worded, that he could not but take notice, that it was expected and provided for, that he &s;hould by no means make any unnece&s;&s;ary &s;tay in his journey; and he found the Gates of <HI>Cambray</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King comes to</HI> Cambray <HI>in his Journey</HI></NOTE> &s;hut when he came thither; and was compell'd to &s;tay long in the af|ternoon, before they were open'd to receive him; <Q>which they excu&s;ed, &startq;by rea&s;on that they under&s;tood the Enemy was at hand, and intended&endq; to &s;it down before that City;</Q> of which there appear'd in the face of all the People, and the Governour him&s;elf, a terrible Apprehen&s;ion. But, <MILESTONE N="30"> upon recollection, his Maje&s;ty was well receiv'd by the Governour, and treated and lodged that night by him in his Hou&s;e; <Q>who was the better compo&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty's a&s;&s;uring him, &startq;that the <HI>French</HI> Army was at a great di&s;tance from him, and that his Maje&s;ty had pa&s;&s;ed through&endq; it the day before (when Mar&s;hal <HI>Turenne</HI> had drawn up the Army to receive his Maje&s;ty;</Q> <Q>the Duke of <HI>York</HI> having there likewi&s;e taken his leave of the King) &startq;and by the march that they then appear'd to make, there was great rea&s;on to conclude that they had no de&s;ign upon <HI>Cam|bray;&endq;</HI></Q> which good information made the King's pre&s;ence the more ac|ceptable. But be&s;ides the civility of that &s;upper, and lodging that night, his Maje&s;ty had not the lea&s;t Addre&s;s from the Arch-Duke, who was <MILESTONE N="40"> within four or five leagues with his Army, but pa&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pa&s;&s;es through</HI> Flanders <HI>with out being taken notice of by the Arch-Duke.</HI></NOTE> notice taken of him, through tho&s;e Provinces; &s;o great a terrour po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the hearts of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> le&s;t their &s;hewing any re&s;pect to the King in his pa&s;&s;age through their Country, &s;hould incen&s;e <HI>Cromwell</HI> again&s;t them, who&s;e friend&s;hip they yet &s;eem'd to have hope of.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty intended to have made no &s;tay, having receiv'd Letters <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At</HI> Mons <HI>$Word$ meets with $Span$</HI></NOTE> from the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his Si&s;ter was already in her journey for the <HI>Spaw.</HI> But, when he came to <HI>Mons,</HI> he found two Gentlemen there, who came out of <HI>England</HI> with Letters and In&s;tructions from tho&s;e of his Friends there who retain'd their old Affections. By them his Maje&s;ty was inform'd, that many of them recover'd new Courage from the Ge|neral di&s;content which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Kingdom, and which every day en|crea&s;ed
<PB N="416" REF="4300">
by the continual Oppre&s;&s;ions, and Tyranny they &s;u&s;tain'd. The Taxes and Impo&s;itions every day were augmented, and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Council, did greater Acts of Soveraignty than ever King and Parlia|ment had attempted. All Goals were full of &s;uch Per&s;ons as contradicted their Commands, and were &s;u&s;pected to wi&s;h well to the King; and there appear'd &s;uch a rend among the Officers of the Army, that the Protector was compell'd to di&s;place many of them, and to put more con|fiding Men in their places. And as this remedy was very nece&s;&s;ary to be applied for his Security, &s;o it prov'd of great reputation to him, even beyond his own hope, or at lea&s;t his confidence. For the licence of the Common Soldiers, manife&s;ted in their general and publick di&s;cour&s;es, <MILESTONE N="10"> cen&s;ures, and reproaches of Him, and his Tyrannical proceedings (which Liberty he well knew was taken by many, that they might di&s;cover the Affections, and Inclinations of other Men, and for his &s;ervice) did not much affect him, or was not terrible to him otherwi&s;e than as they were Soldiers of this, or that Regiment, and under this or that Captain, who&s;e Officers he knew well hated him, and who had their Soldiers &s;o much at their Devotion, that they could lead them upon any Enter|pri&s;e: and he knew well that this &s;editious Spirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many of the principal Officers both of Hor&s;e and Foot, who hated him now, in the &s;ame proportion that they had heretofore lov'd him, above all the world. <MILESTONE N="20"> This loud di&s;temper grew the more formidable to him, in that he did believe the fire was kindled and blown by <HI>Lambert,</HI> and that they were all conducted and in&s;pired by his melancholick, and undi&s;cern'd Spirit, though yet all things were outwardly very fair between them. Upon this di&s;qui&s;ition he &s;aw hazard enough in attempting any Reformation (which the Army thought he dur&s;t not undertake to do alone, and they feared not his proceeding by a Council of War, where they knew they had many Friends) but apparent danger, and very probable ruin, if he deferr'd it. And &s;o tru&s;ting only to, and depending upon his own Stars, he ca&s;hier'd ten or a dozen Officers, though not of the highe&s;t Command, <MILESTONE N="30"> and tho&s;e whom he mo&s;t apprehended, yet of tho&s;e petulant and active humours, which made them for the pre&s;ent mo&s;t u&s;eful to the others, and mo&s;t pernicious to Him. By this experiment he found the example wrought great effects upon many who were not touch'd by it, and that the Men who had done &s;o much mi&s;chief, being now reduced to a pri|vate condition, and like other particular Men, did not only lo&s;e all their credit with the Soldiers, but behaved them&s;elves with much more wa|rine&s;s and re&s;ervation towards all other Men. This gave him more ea&s;e than he had before enjoy'd, and rai&s;ed his re&s;olution how to proceed here|after <MILESTONE N="40"> upon the like Provocations, and gave him great credit, and autho|rity, with tho&s;e who had believ'd that many Officers had a greater in|fluence upon the Army than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT was very evident that he had &s;ome War in his purpo&s;e; for from the time that he had made a Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he took greater care to encrea&s;e his Stores and Magazines of Armes and Ammunition, and to build more Ships, than he had ever done before; and he had given order to make ready two great Fleets in the Winter, under Officers who &s;hould have no dependence upon each other; and Land-men were likewi&s;e appointed to be levied. Some principal Officers among&s;t the&s;e, <MILESTONE N="50"> made great profe&s;&s;ions of Duty to the King; and made tender of their Service to his Maje&s;ty by the&s;e Gentlemen. It was thought nece&s;&s;ary to make a day's &s;tay at <HI>Mons,</HI> to di&s;patch tho&s;e Gentlemen; who were
<PB N="417" REF="4310">
very well known, and worthy to be tru&s;ted. Such Commi&s;&s;ions were prepared for them, and &s;uch In&s;tructions, as were de&s;ired by tho&s;e who employ'd them. <Q>And his Maje&s;ty gave nothing &s;o much in Charge to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>$Span$ F$$ends in</HI> $Span$ <HI>to b$ $Word$.</HI></NOTE> the Me&s;&s;engers, and to all his Friends in <HI>England</HI> with whom he had corre&s;pondence, as &startq;that they &s;hould live quietly, without making any de&s;perate or unrea&s;onable attempt, or giving advantage to tho&s;e who watched them, to put them into Pri&s;on, and to ruin their e&s;tates and&endq; families.</Q> <Q>He told them, &startq;the vanity of imagining that any In&s;ur|rection could give any trouble to &s;o well a form'd and di&s;ciplin'd Ar|my, and the de&s;truction that mu&s;t attend &s;uch a ra&s;h attempt: that, <MILESTONE N="$$"> as he would be allways ready to venture his own Per&s;on with them in any rea&s;onable, and well form'd undertaking; &s;o he would with pa|tience attend God's own time for &s;uch an opportunity; and, in the mean time, he would &s;it &s;till in &s;uch a convenient place as he &s;hould&endq; find willing to receive him;</Q> of which he could yet make no judgement: however, it was very nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be in the hands of di&s;creet and able Men, in Expectation of two Contingencies, which might rea&s;onably be expected. The one, &s;uch a &s;chi&s;$ in the Ar|my, as might divide it upon contrary Intere&s;ts into open Conte&s;ts, and Declarations again&s;t each other, which could not but produce an equal <MILESTONE N="2$"> &s;chi&s;$ in the Government: the other, the death of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> which was con&s;pired by the Levellers, under &s;everal Combinations. And if that fell out, it could hardly be imagined, that the Army would re|main united to the particular de&s;ign of any &s;ingle Per&s;on, but that the Parliament, which had been with &s;o much violence turn'd out of doors by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and which took it &s;elf to be perpetual, would quickly a&s;|&s;emble again together, and take upon them&s;elves the &s;upreme Govern|ment.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, who was unque&s;tionably the &s;econd Per&s;on in the Com|mand of the Army, and was thought to be the fir&s;t in their Affections, <MILESTONE N="$$"> had had no le&s;s hand than <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf in the Di&s;&s;olution of that Parliament, and was principal in rai&s;ing him to be Protector under the In&s;trument of Government; and &s;o could never rea&s;onably hope to be tru&s;ted, and employ'd by them in the ab&s;olute Command of an Army that had already &s;o notoriou&s;ly rebell'd again&s;t their Ma&s;ters. Then <HI>Monk,</HI> who had the ab&s;olute Command in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was his Rival already, under a mutual jealou&s;y, would never &s;ubmit to the Govern|ment of <HI>Lambert,</HI> if he had no other Title to it than his own pre&s;umption; and <HI>Harry Cromwell</HI> had made him&s;elf &s;o popular in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that he would not, probably, be commanded by a Man whom he knew to be <MILESTONE N="4$"> his Father's greate&s;t Enemy. The&s;e con&s;iderations had made that im|pre&s;&s;ion upon tho&s;e in <HI>England</HI> who were the mo&s;t wary and aver&s;e from any ra&s;h Attempt, that they all wi&s;h'd that Commi&s;&s;ions, and all other nece&s;&s;ary powers, might be granted by the King, and depo&s;ited in &s;uch good hands as had the courage to tru&s;t them&s;elves with the keep|ing them, till &s;uch a conjuncture &s;hould fall out as is mention'd, and of which few Men thought there was rea&s;on to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>THE King having in this manner di&s;patch'd tho&s;e Me&s;&s;engers, and &s;ettled the be&s;t way he could to corre&s;pond with his friends, continued his journey from <HI>Mons</HI> to <HI>Namur;</HI> where he had a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age by <MILESTONE N="50"> Water to <HI>Liege;</HI> from whence, in five or &s;ix hours, he reach'd the <HI>Spaw,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King a$|r$ves at the</HI> Spaw <HI>where he meets the Pri$$e&s;s of</HI> O|range.</NOTE> the next day after the Prince&s;s Royal, his beloved Si&s;ter, was come thi|ther, and where they re&s;olv'd to &s;pend two or three months together;
<PB N="418" REF="4320">
which they did, to their &s;ingular content and &s;atisfaction. And for &s;ome time the Joy of being out of <HI>France,</HI> where his Maje&s;ty had enjoy'd no other plea&s;ure than being alive, and the delight of the Company he was now in, &s;u&s;pended all thoughts of what place he was next to retire to. For as it could not be fit for his Si&s;ter to &s;tay longer from her own Affairs in <HI>Holland,</HI> than the pretence of her health required, &s;o the <HI>Spaw</HI> was a place that no body could &s;tay longer in than the &s;ea&s;on for the Waters continued; which ended with the Summer.</P>
<P>THE King no &s;ooner arriv'd at the <HI>Spaw,</HI> than the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Roche&s;ter <HI>re|turns to the King from</HI> Ra|tisbone.</NOTE> return'd thither to him from his Negotiation at <HI>Ratisbone;</HI> where he had remain'd during the Diet, without owning the Character he might have <MILESTONE N="10"> a&s;&s;umed; yet perform'd all the Offices with the Emperour, and the other Princes, with le&s;s noi&s;e, and expence, and with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s as he could have expected from any qualification. The truth is, all the <HI>German</HI> Princes were at that time very poor; and that meeting for the choo&s;ing a King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> was of va&s;t expence to every one of them, and full of faction, and contradiction; &s;o that they had little lei&s;ure, and le&s;s in|clination, to think of any bu&s;ine&s;s but what concern'd them&s;elves: yet in the clo&s;e of the Diet, by the conduct and dexterity of the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> who was e&s;teem'd the wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t practical Prince of the Empire, and who, out of meer genero&s;ity, was exceedingly affected <MILESTONE N="20"> with the ill fortune of the King; that A&s;&s;embly was prevail'd with to grant a &s;ub&s;idy of four Romer months; which is the mea&s;ure of all <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King ob|tains a &s;mall &s;ub&s;idy from the Diet in</HI> Germany.</NOTE> Taxes, and impo&s;itions in <HI>Germany;</HI> that is, by the Romer months, which every Prince is to pay, and cau&s;e it to be collected from their Subjects in their own method. This Money was to be paid towards the better &s;upport of the King of great <HI>Britain.</HI> And the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> by his own Example, per&s;waded as many of the Princes as he had credit with, forthwith to pay their proportions to the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> who was &s;ollicitous enough to receive it. The whole contribution, if it had been generou&s;ly made good, had not amounted to any con&s;iderable Sum <MILESTONE N="30"> upon &s;o important an occa&s;ion. But the Emperour him&s;elf paid no|thing, nor many other of the Princes, among&s;t whom were the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> who had both receiv'd great obligations from King <HI>James,</HI> and the la&s;t King his Son: So that the whole that was ever paid to the King, did not amount to ten thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling; a great part whereof was &s;pent in the Negotiation of the Earl, and in the many journies he made to the Princes, being extremely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Spirit of being the King's General, which he thought he &s;hould not be, except he made Levies of Men; for which he was very &s;ollicitous to make Contracts with old <HI>German</HI> Officers, <MILESTONE N="40"> when there was neither Port in view, where he might embark them, nor a po&s;&s;ibility of procuring Ships to tran&s;port them, though <HI>Cromwell</HI> had not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any Naval power to have re&s;i&s;ted them; &s;o blind Men are, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o &s;trong, and their judgements &s;o weak, that they can look but upon one thing at once.</P>
<P>THAT part of the Money that was paid to his Maje&s;ty's u&s;e, was ma|naged with very good Husbandry, and was a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upport to his well order'd Family, which with his own Expences for his Table, and his Stable, and the Board-Wages, with which all his Servants from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t were well &s;atisfied, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hment <MILESTONE N="5$"> after he left <HI>France,</HI> amounted not to above &s;ix hundred Pi&s;toles a month; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The monthly Expences of the King's &s;mall Family</NOTE> which expence was not exceeded in many years, even until his coming

into <HI>Holland</HI> in order to his Return into <HI>England.</HI> This method in the managery gave the King great ea&s;e; contented, and kept the fa|mily in better order and humour than could rea&s;onably have been ex|pected; and was the more &s;atisfactory, by the no-care, and order, that had been ob&s;erved during all the re&s;idence the King had made in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THE King &s;tayed not &s;o long at the <HI>Spaw</HI> as he meant to have done, the &s;mall Pox breaking out there; and one of the young Ladies who at|tended upon the Prince&s;s Royal, being &s;ei&s;ed upon by it, died: &s;o that his Maje&s;ty, and his Si&s;ter, upon very &s;uddain thoughts, remov'd from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|moves to</HI> A|ken $Word$ Sp$w.</NOTE> the <HI>Spaw</HI> to <HI>Aken,</HI> or <HI>Aqui&s;grane,</HI> an Imperial, and Free Town, go|vern'd <MILESTONE N="10"> by their own Magi&s;trates; where the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> ought to receive his fir&s;t Iron Crown, which is kept there. This place is fa|mous for its hot baths, whither many come after they have drank the cold Waters of the <HI>Spaw,</HI> and was a part of the pre&s;cription which the Phy&s;icians had made to the Prince&s;s, after &s;he &s;hould have fini&s;h'd her Waters in the other Place. Upon that pretence, and for the u&s;e of tho&s;e Baths, the Courts remov'd now thither; but in truth with a de|&s;ign that the King might make his re&s;idence there, the Town being large, and the Country about it plea&s;ant, and within five hours (for the journies in tho&s;e Countries are mea&s;ur'd by hours) of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> the <MILESTONE N="2$"> mo&s;t plea&s;ant Seat within the Dominions of the United Provinces. The Magi&s;trates receiv'd the King &s;o civilly, that his Maje&s;ty, who knew no other place where he was &s;ure to be admitted, re&s;olv'd to &s;tay there; and, in order thereunto, contracted for a convenient Hou&s;e, which be|longed to one who was called a Baron; whither he re&s;olv'd to remove, a&s;&s;oon as his Si&s;ter, who had taken the two great Inns of the Town for her's, and the King's Accommodation, &s;hould return into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the good old Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who had remain'd in <HI>Hol|land</HI> from the time that, upon the Treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> the King had tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>Scotland,</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Secretary</HI> $Span$ <HI>to the King, and the King</HI> $Word$ <HI>him the Sig|net.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"> who receiv'd him very graciou&s;ly, as a Per&s;on of great merit and inte|grity from the beginning of the Troubles, and allways entirely tru&s;ted by the King his Father. And now to him the King gave his Signet; which for three years had been kept by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, out of friend&s;hip that it might be re&s;tored to him. And he had there|fore refu&s;ed in <HI>France</HI> to be admitted into the Secretary's Office, which he executed, becau&s;e he knew that they who advi&s;ed it, did it rather that <HI>Nicholas</HI> might not have it, than out of any kindne&s;s to him&s;elf. He held him&s;elf obliged by the friend&s;hip, that had ever been between them, to pre&s;erve it for him; and, a&s;&s;oon as he came to <HI>Aken,</HI> de&s;ired <MILESTONE N="40"> the King to declare him to be his Secretary; which was done; by which he had a fa&s;t friend added to the Council, and of general reputation.</P>
<P>WHEN the King remain'd at <HI>Aken,</HI> he receiv'd many Expre&s;&s;es out <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Accounts the King re|ceives $ere ou$ of</HI> England.</NOTE> of <HI>England,</HI> which inform'd him of the renew'd courage of his Friends there: that the Faction and Animo&s;ity, which every day appear'd be|tween the Officers of the Army, and in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Council, upon par|ticular Intere&s;t, rai&s;ed a general opinion and hope, that there would be an ab&s;olute rupture between them; when either Party would be glad to make a conjunction with the King's. In order thereunto, there was an Intelligence enter'd into throughout the Kingdom, that they might make u&s;e of &s;uch an occa&s;ion; and they &s;ent now to the King to be di|rected <MILESTONE N="5$"> by him, how they &s;hould behave them&s;elves upon &s;uch and &s;uch contingencies; and &s;ent for more Commi&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame kind as had

<P>THE Sea&s;on of the year now begun to approach that would oblige the Prince&s;s Royal to return to the <HI>H$gue,</HI> le&s;t the jealous States,
<PB N="421" REF="4350">
from her long ab&s;ence, might be induced to contrive &s;ome Act preju|dicial to her, and her Son; which &s;he was the more liable to, from the unkind Differences between Her and the Prince&s;s Dowager, Mother of the decea&s;ed Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> a Lady of great cunning and dexterity to promote her own Intere&s;t. The air of <HI>Aken,</HI> and the ill &s;mell of the Baths, made that place le&s;s agreeable to the King than at fir&s;t he believ'd it to be; and he wi&s;h'd to find a better Town to re&s;ide in, which he might be put to endure long. The City of <HI>Cologne</HI> was di&s;tant from <HI>Aken</HI> two &s;hort days journey, and had the fame of an excellent Situation. But the People were reported to be of a proud and mutinous Nature, <MILESTONE N="1$"> allways in Rebellion again&s;t their Bi&s;hop and Prince, and of &s;o much Bigottry in Religion that they had expelled all Prote&s;tants out of their City, and would &s;uffer no exerci&s;e of Religion, but of the Roman Ca|tholick. So that there &s;eem'd little hope that they would permit the King to re&s;ide there; the rather, becau&s;e it was the Staple for the Wines of that Country, and maintain'd a good intelligence and trade with <HI>England.</HI> If the King &s;hould &s;end thither to provide a Hou&s;e, and de|clare a purpo&s;e to &s;tay there, and they &s;hould refu&s;e to receive him, it might be of very ill con&s;equence, and fright any other places, and <HI>Aken</HI> it &s;elf, from permitting him to return thither; and therefore that Adven|ture <MILESTONE N="20"> was to be avoided. At la&s;t it was concluded, that the Prince&s;s Royal &s;hould make <HI>Cologne</HI> her way into <HI>Holland;</HI> which was rea&s;onable enough, by the convenience of the River for the commodious tran&s;por|tation of her Goods, and Family: and the King, accompanying her &s;o far, might make a judgement, upon his ob&s;ervation, whether it would be be&s;t for him to &s;tay there, or to return to <HI>Aken;</HI> where he would leave his Family, as the place where he had taken a Hou&s;e, and to which he meant in few days to return. With this re&s;olution they left <HI>Aken,</HI> about the middle of <HI>September;</HI> and lodging one night at <HI>Juliers,</HI> a little dirty Town upon a flat, not worthy to have made a Quarrel be|tween <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;o many of the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> nor of the fame it got by the Siege, they came the next day to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where they were receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Sep$ember <HI>the King and $Word$ come to</HI> Cologne</NOTE> with all the Re&s;pect, Pomp, and Magnificence, that could be expected, or the City could perform. The Hou&s;e which the Harbingers of the Prince&s;s had taken for her Reception, &s;erv'd likewi&s;e to accommodate the King; and the Magi&s;trates perform'd their Re&s;pects to both with all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of civility.</P>
<P>COLOGNE is a City mo&s;t plea&s;antly Situated upon the Banks of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> of a large extent, and fair and &s;ub&s;tantial Buildings; and en|compa&s;&s;ed with a broad and excellent rampart, upon which are fair <MILESTONE N="4$"> Walks of great Elms, where two Coaches may go on brea&s;t, and, for the beauty of it, is not inferior to the Walls of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> but rather &s;uperior, becau&s;e This goes round the Town. The Government is un|der the Senate and Con&s;uls; <Q>of whom there was one then Con&s;ul, who &s;aid &startq;he was de&s;cended from Father to Son of a Patrician Roman Fa|mily, that had continued from the time the Colony was fir&s;t planted&endq; there.</Q> It had never been otherwi&s;e &s;ubject to the Bi&s;hops, than in &s;ome points which refer to their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction; which They &s;ometimes endeavouring to enlarge, the Magi&s;trates allways oppo&s;e: and that gives the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e of Jealou&s;ies, and Conte&s;ts, <MILESTONE N="50"> between their Prince and Them; which are neither &s;o frequent, nor of that moment, as they are reported to be. The Elector never re&s;ides there, but keeps his Court at his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bonne,</HI> near four Miles from
<PB N="422" REF="4360">
thence. And that Elector, who was of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and a melancholick and peevi&s;h Man, had not then been in the City in very many years. The Number of Churches and Religious Hou&s;es is incre|dible; <Q>in&s;omuch as it was then averr'd, &startq;that the Religious Per&s;ons and&endq; Church-men made up a full moiety of the Inhabitants of the Town;</Q> and Their intere&s;t and authority &s;o far prevailed, that, &s;ome few years before the King came thither, they expell'd all tho&s;e of the Prote&s;tant Religion, contrary to the Advice of the wi&s;e&s;t of the Magi&s;trates; <Q>who confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that the Trade of the Town was much decayed thereby, and&endq; the Poverty thereof much encrea&s;ed.</Q> And it is very po&s;&s;ible, that the va&s;t Number, and unskilful Zeal of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Religious Per|&s;ons, <MILESTONE N="1$"> may at &s;ome time expo&s;e that noble City to the &s;urpri&s;e of &s;ome powerful Prince, who would quickly deprive them of their long enjoy'd Privileges. And there was, in that very time of the King's &s;tay there, a de&s;ign by the <HI>French</HI> to have &s;urpri&s;ed it; <HI>Schomberg</HI> lying many days in wait there, to have perform'd that Service; which was very hardly pre|vented. The People are &s;o much more civil than they were reported to be, that they &s;eem to be the mo&s;t conver&s;ible, and to under&s;tand the Laws of Society and Conver&s;ation better than any other People of <HI>Ger|many.</HI> To the King they were &s;o devoted, that when they under&s;tood <MILESTONE N="20"> he was not &s;o fixed to the re&s;olution of re&s;iding at <HI>Aken,</HI> but that he might be diverted from it, they very hand&s;omely made tender to him <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citizens invite the King to re&s;ide there.</NOTE> of any accommodation that City could yield him, and of all the Af|fection and Duty they could pay him; which his Maje&s;ty mo&s;t willingly accepted; and giving Order for the payment of the rent of the Hou&s;e he had taken at <HI>Aken,</HI> which he had not at all u&s;ed, and other disbur&s;|ments, which the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e had made to make it the more convenient for his Maje&s;ty, and likewi&s;e &s;ending very gracious Letters to the Magi&s;trates of that Town, for the civility they had expre&s;&s;ed to|wards him, he &s;ent for that part of his Family which remain'd there, <MILESTONE N="30"> to attend him at <HI>Cologne;</HI> where he declared he would &s;pend that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King $Word$ th$$$</NOTE> Winter.</P>

Both the King and his Si&s;ter were naturally enough inclined to new &s;ights, and fe&s;ti|vities; and the King thought it of moment to him to receive the re&s;pect and civility of any of the <HI>German</HI> Princes: and among Them, there were few more con&s;iderable in their Dominions, and None in their Per|&s;ons, than the Duke of <HI>Newburgh;</HI> who reckon'd him&s;elf upon the &s;ame Level with the Electors. <Q>And the King was inform'd, &startq;that the Em|perour&endq; him&s;elf allways treated him with <HI>Alte&s;&s;e;</HI></Q> and therefore his Maje&s;ty made no Scruple of giving him the &s;ame. The matter of &s;a|luting the Prince&s;s Royal was of a new and delicate nature; that dignity <MILESTONE N="10"> had been &s;o punctually pre&s;erv'd, from the time of her coming into <HI>Hol|land,</HI> that the old Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Father of her Husband, would ne|ver pretend to it: yet that Ceremony depending only upon the cu&s;tom of Countries, and the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> being a Soveraign Prince, in|ferior to none in <HI>Germany,</HI> and his Emba&s;&s;adour allways covering before the Emperour, the King thought fit, and her Royal Highne&s;s con&s;ented, that the Duke &s;hould &s;alute her. And &s;o all matters being adju&s;ted without any Noi&s;e, the King, about the middle of <HI>October,</HI> accom|panied his Si&s;ter by Water to <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp;</HI> where they arriv'd between three and four of the Clock in the Afternoon; and found the Duke and <MILESTONE N="20"> his Duche&s;s waiting for them on the &s;ide of the Water; where after having perform'd their mutual Civilities and Compliments, the King, and the Prince&s;s Royal, and the Duke and the Duche&s;s of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> went into the Duke's Coach, and the Company into the Coaches which were provided for them, and alighted at the Ca&s;tle, that was very near; where his Maje&s;ty was conducted into his Quarter, and the Prince&s;s into Her's, the Duke and the Duche&s;s immediately retiring into their own Quarters; where they new dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and vi&s;ited not the King again till above half an hour before Supper, and after the King and Prince&s;s had perform'd their Devotion.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;tle is a very princely Hou&s;e, having been the Seat of the <MILESTONE N="30"> Duke of <HI>Cleve;</HI> which Duchy, together with that of <HI>Juliers,</HI> having lately fallen to Heirs Females (whereof the Mothers of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> were two) when all the Pre|tenders &s;ei&s;ing upon that which lay mo&s;t convenient to them, this of <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp,</HI> by agreement, afterwards remain'd &s;till to <HI>Newburgh;</HI> who&s;e Father, being of the Reform'd Religion in the late contention, found the Hou&s;e of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> too &s;trong for him, by having the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the States his fa&s;t Friends; and thereupon, that he might have a &s;trong Support from the Emperour and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> became <MILESTONE N="40"> Roman Catholick, and thereby had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected. At the &s;ame time he put his Son, who was then very young, to be bred un|der the Je&s;uits; by which Education, the pre&s;ent Duke was with more than ordinary Bigottry zealous in the Roman Religion.</P>
<P>HE was a Man of very fine parts of knowledge, and in his manners and behaviour much the be&s;t bred of any <HI>German.</HI> He had the flowing civility, and language of the <HI>French,</HI> enough re&s;train'd, and controled by the <HI>German</HI> gravity and formality; &s;o that, altogether, he &s;eem'd a very accompli&s;h'd Prince, and became him&s;elf very well, having a good Per&s;on, and graceful Motion. He was at that time above thirty, and <MILESTONE N="50"> had been married to the Si&s;ter of the former, and the then King of <HI>Po|land;</HI> who leaving only a Daughter, he was now newly married to the Daughter of the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt,</HI> who upon her mar|riage

became Roman Catholick. She had no eminent features of beauty, nor the <HI>French</HI> Language and Vivacity, to contribute to the Entertain|ment; &s;o that &s;he was rather a Spectator of the fe&s;tivity, than a part of it. The entertainment was very &s;plendid and magnificent in all prepa|rations, as well for the Tables which were prepared for the Lords and the Ladies, as That where his Maje&s;ty and his Si&s;ter and the Duke and the Duche&s;s only &s;ate: the meals, according to the cu&s;tom of <HI>Germany,</HI> very long, with &s;everal &s;orts of Mu&s;ick, both of In&s;truments and Voices; which, if not excellent, was new, and differ'd much from what his Ma|je&s;ty was accu&s;tom'd to hear. There was Wine in abundance, but no <MILESTONE N="1$"> Man pre&s;&s;ed to drink, if he called not for it; and the Duke him&s;elf an Enemy to all exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>AFTER two days &s;pent in this manner, in which time the King made a great friend&s;hip with the Duke, which allways continued, they parted; and there being near the River, di&s;tant another &s;hort day's jour|ney, a hand&s;ome open Town of good receipt, call'd <HI>Santen,</HI> belonging <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King brings his Si&s;ter to</HI> San|ten <HI>in the Duchy of</HI> Cleve; <HI>where they part; and the King returns to</HI> Cologne.</NOTE> to that part of the Duchy of <HI>Cleve</HI> which was a&s;&s;ign'd to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> the King re&s;olv'd to accompany his Si&s;ter thither; where having &s;pent that night, the next morning her Royal Highne&s;s, after an unwilling Farewel, pro&s;ecuted her journey to <HI>Holland,</HI> and his Ma|je&s;ty <MILESTONE N="20"> return'd by Hor&s;e to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where the &s;ame Hou&s;e was prepared for him in which He and his Si&s;ter had inhabited, whil&s;t &s;he &s;tayed there. And by this time the end of <HI>October</HI> was come; which, in tho&s;e parts, is more than the entrance into Winter.

<P>THE Nuntio of the Pope re&s;ided in that City, and perform'd all re&s;pects to his Maje&s;ty: He was a proper and grave Man, an <HI>Italian</HI> Bi&s;hop, who never made the lea&s;t &s;cruple at his Maje&s;ty's enjoying the liberty of his Chapel, and the exerci&s;e of his Religion, though it was very publick; &s;o that in truth his Maje&s;ty was not without any re&s;pect <MILESTONE N="4$"> that could be &s;hew'd to him in tho&s;e parts, &s;ave that the Elector never came to &s;ee him, though he liv'd within little more than an hour; which he excu&s;ed by &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition of health, and unwillingne&s;s to enter into that City; though it proceeded as much from the &s;ullenne&s;s, and moro&s;ene&s;s of his Nature, unapt for any conver&s;ation, and aver&s;e from all civilities; which made him for a long time to defer the pay|ment of his &s;mall Quota, which had been granted to the King by the Diet, and was at la&s;t extorted from him by an importunity unfit to have been pre&s;&s;ed upon any other Prince, or Gentleman. This Elector's de|fect of urbanity was the more excu&s;able, or the le&s;s to be complain'd of, <MILESTONE N="$$"> &s;ince the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> &s;o nearly allied to the Crown, and &s;o much obliged by it, did not think fit to take any notice of the King's being &s;o near him, or to &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger to &s;alute him.</P>

WITHIN a &s;hort time after his Maje&s;ty's return to <HI>Cologne,</HI> he re|ceiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the e$dea|vours at</HI> Paris <HI>to perv$rt the Duke of</HI> Glo|ce&s;ter <HI>in his Religion.</HI></NOTE> news that exceedingly afflicted him, and the more, that he knew not what remedy to apply to the mi&s;chief which he &s;aw was likely to befall him upon it. From <HI>Paris,</HI> his Maje&s;ty heard, that the Queen had put away the Tutor he had left to attend his Brother the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter;</HI> who remain'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> upon her Maje&s;ty's de&s;ire, that he might learn his Exerci&s;es. <Q>The Queen had conferr'd with him upon &startq;the de&s;peratene&s;s of his condition, in re&s;pect of the King his Brother's fortune, and the little hope that appear'd that his Maje&s;ty could ever be re&s;tored, at lea&s;t if he did not him&s;elf become Roman Catholick; <MILESTONE N="10"> whereby the Pope, and other Princes of that Religion, might be united in his quarrel; which they would never undertake upon any other obligation: that it was therefore fit that the Duke, who had nothing to &s;upport him, nor could expect any thing from the King, &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the Roman Catholick Religion; that &s;o, becoming a good Catholick, he might be capable of tho&s;e advantages which her Maje&s;ty &s;hould be able to procure for him: that the Queen of <HI>France</HI> would hereupon confer Abbies, and Benefices upon him, to &s;uch a value, as would maintain him in that &s;plendor as was &s;uitable to his Birth: that, in a little time, the Pope would make him a Cardinal; <MILESTONE N="$0"> by which he might be able to do the King his Brother much &s;ervice, and contribute to his Recovery; whereas, without this, he mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to great nece&s;&s;ity, and mi&s;ery, for that &s;he was not able any&endq; longer to give him maintainance.</Q> She found the Duke more re&s;olute than &s;he expected from his Age; he was &s;o well in&s;tructed in his Reli|gion, that he di&s;puted again&s;t the change; urged the precepts he had re|ceiv'd from the King his Father, and his dying in the Faith he had pre|&s;cribed to him; put her Maje&s;ty in mind of the promi&s;e &s;he had made to the King his Brother at parting; <Q>and acknowledged &startq;that he had ob|liged him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty, that he would never change his Religion; <MILESTONE N="30"> and therefore be&s;ought her Maje&s;ty, that &s;he would not farther pre&s;s&endq; him, at lea&s;t till he &s;hould inform the King of it.</Q> The Queen well enough knew the King's mind, and thought it more excu&s;able to pro|ceed in that Affair without imparting it to him; and therefore took upon her the Authority of a Mother, and remov'd his Tutor from him; and committed the Duke to the care of Abbot <HI>Mountague</HI> her Almoner; who, having the plea&s;ant Abby of <HI>Pontoi&s;e,</HI> entertain'd his Highne&s;s there, &s;eque&s;ter'd from all re&s;ort of &s;uch Per&s;ons as might confirm him in his aver&s;ene&s;s from being converted.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the King receiv'd this adverti&s;ement, which both the <MILESTONE N="4$"> Duke and his Tutor made ha&s;t to tran&s;mit to him, he was exceedingly perplexed. On the one hand, his Maje&s;ty knew the reproaches which would be ca&s;t upon him by his Enemies, who took all the pains they could to per&s;wade the world, that he him&s;elf had changed his Religion; and though his exerci&s;e of it was &s;o publick, wherever he was, that Strangers re&s;orted to it, and &s;o could bear witne&s;s of it, yet their impu|dence was &s;uch in their po&s;itive averment, that they per&s;waded many in <HI>England,</HI> and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e of the Reform'd Religion abroad, that his Maje&s;ty was in truth a Papi&s;t: and his leaving his Brother be|hind him in <HI>France,</HI> where it was evident the Queen would endeavour <MILESTONE N="$$"> to pervert him, would be an Argument, that he did not de&s;ire to pre|vent it: on the other &s;ide, he knew well the little credit he had in <HI>France,</HI> and how &s;ar they would be from a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, in a conte&s;t of &s;uch a na|ture

<P>THE Marquis behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much wi&s;dom and re&s;olution, that though the Queen was enough offended with him, and with the expo&s;tulation the King made with her, and imputed all the King's &s;harp|ne&s;s and re&s;olution to the Coun&s;el he received from the Marquis and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, yet &s;he thought not fit to extend her <MILESTONE N="20"> power in detaining the Duke, both again&s;t the King's and his own Will; <Q>and the Duke, upon the receipt of the King's Letter, declared &startq;that&endq; he would obey his Maje&s;ty;</Q> and the Abbot found, that he mu&s;t enter into an ab&s;olute defiance with the King, if he per&s;i&s;ted in advi&s;ing the Queen not to comply with his Maje&s;ty's directions: &s;o that, after two or three days deliberation, the Queen expre&s;&s;ing very much di&s;plea&s;ure at the King's proceeding, and that &s;he &s;hould wholely be deve&s;ted of the power and authority of a Mother, told the Marquis, <Q>&startq;that the Duke might di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf as he plea&s;ed; and that &s;he would not&endq; <MILESTONE N="$$"> concern her &s;elf farther, nor &s;ee him any more.</Q> And thereupon the Duke put him&s;elf into the hands of the Marquis; who immediately removed him from <HI>Pontoi&s;e</HI> to the Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Hatton,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lord, who lived then in <HI>Paris;</HI> where he remain'd for &s;ome days, un|til the Marquis could borrow Money (which was no ea&s;y matter) to de|fray the journey to the King.

<P>INNOCENT the tenth was now dead; who had outlived the Under|&s;tanding and Judgement he had been formerly Ma&s;ter of, and lo&s;t all the Reputation he had formerly gotten; and, as <HI>Jehoram, departed without being de&s;ired.</HI> He had fomented the Rebellion in <HI>England</HI> by cheri&s;hing that in <HI>Ireland;</HI> whither he had &s;ent a light-headed Nuntio, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> New b$rgh <HI>&s;end$ the King word, that Card$nal</HI> Chi|gi <HI>was cho&s;en Pope; and his di&s;cour&s;e with his Maje&s;ty concerning making &s;ome application to the Pope for &s;upply and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</HI></NOTE> who did much mi&s;chief to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, as hath been touched before.

The truth is, the un|equal temper of tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd very well, and the jealou&s;y, at lea&s;t <MILESTONE N="30"> the want of confidence in each other, made the King's part exceeding difficult.

Lady, who had been brought up in the Court of the Queen of <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> and was the Daughter of a Gentleman of a very noble family, who had been long an Officer in <HI>Holland.</HI> The King had made this <HI>Dutch-</HI>man a Baronet; and &s;ome who were nearly acquainted with him, were confident that his Maje&s;ty might &s;ecretly repo&s;e him&s;elf in his Hou&s;e, without any notice taken of him, as long as it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for him to be concealed. And his Maje&s;ty being fir&s;t a&s;&s;ured of this, made his journey directly thither, in the manner mentioned be|fore; and being receiv'd, as he expected, in that Hou&s;e, he gave pre&s;ent notice to S^r <HI>John Mennes</HI> and M^r <HI>Nicholas,</HI> that they might know whi|ther <MILESTONE N="10"> to re&s;ort to his Maje&s;ty upon any occa&s;ion. <Q>Upon his fir&s;t Arrival there, he receiv'd intelligence, &startq;that the Me&s;&s;enger who had been di&s;|patched from <HI>Cologne,</HI> met with cro&s;s winds and accidents in his re|turn, which had been his misfortune likewi&s;e in his journey thither; &s;o that he came not &s;o &s;oon to <HI>London</HI> as was expected; whereupon &s;ome conceiv'd that the King did not approve the day, and therefore excu&s;ed them&s;elves from appearing at the time; others were well con|tent with the excu&s;e, having di&s;cern'd, with the approach of the day, that they had embark'd them&s;elves in a de&s;ign of more difficulty than was at fir&s;t apprehended; and &s;ome were actually &s;ei&s;ed upon, and <MILESTONE N="20"> impri&s;on'd, by which they were incapable of performing their pro|mi&s;e.&endq;</Q> Though this di&s;appointment confirm'd the King in his former belief, that nothing &s;olid could re&s;ult from &s;uch a general combina|tion; yet he thought it fit, now he was in a Po&s;t where he might &s;e|curely re&s;t, to expect what the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s pre&s;ence, of who&s;e being in <HI>London</HI> he was adverti&s;ed, might produce.

<P>THERE cannot be a greater Manife&s;tation of the univer&s;al prejudice <MILESTONE N="30"> and aver&s;ion in the whole Kingdom towards <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Govern|ment, than that there could be &s;o many de&s;igns and con&s;piracies again&s;t him, which were communicated to &s;o many Men, and that &s;uch &s;ignal and notable Per&s;ons could re&s;ort to <HI>London,</HI> and remain there, without any &s;uch information or di&s;covery, as might enable him to cau&s;e them to be apprehended; there being no body intent and zealous to make any &s;uch di&s;coveries, but &s;uch who&s;e trade it was for great Wages to give him tho&s;e informations, who &s;eldom care whether what they inform be true or no.

<P>SIR <HI>Jo&s;eph Wagstaff</HI> had been formerly Major General of the Foot in the King's We&s;tern Army, a Man generally beloved; and though he was rather for execution than coun&s;el, a &s;tout Man, who looked not far before him; yet he had a great companionablene&s;s in his nature, <MILESTONE N="2$"> which exceedingly prevail'd with tho&s;e, who, in the intermi&s;&s;ion of fighting, loved to &s;pend their time in jollity and mirth. He, a&s;&s;o$$ as the day was appointed, left <HI>London,</HI> and went to &s;ome of his f$$ends Hou&s;es in the Country, near the place, that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t the $$epa|rations as much as was po&s;&s;ible.

They accounted that they were already &s;trong enough to vi&s;it <HI>Salisbury</HI> in all its pre&s;ent $u&s;tre, knowing that they had many friends there, and reckoning that all who were not again&s;t them, were for them; and that they &s;hould there en|crea&s;e their Numbers both in Foot, and Hor&s;e; with which the Town then a bounded: Nor did their computation and conjecture fail them. They enter'd the City about five of the Clock in the morning: they ap|pointed &s;ome Officers, of which they had plenty, to cau&s;e all the Stables <MILESTONE N="4$"> to be locked up, that all the Hor&s;es might be at their devotion; others, to b$eak open the Goales, that all there might attend their Benefactors. They kept a good Body of Hor&s;e upon the Market-place, to encounter all oppo&s;ition; and gave order to apprehend the Judges and the Sheriff, who were yet in their Beds, and to bring them into the Market-place with their &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ions, not caring to &s;ei&s;e upon the Per&s;ons of any others.</P>
<P>ALL this was done with &s;o little noi&s;e or di&s;order, as if the Town had been all of one mind.

<P>THE Noi&s;e of this Action was very great both in and out of the Kingdom, whither it was quickly &s;ent.

All that was rea&s;onable in the general contrivance of in|&s;urrection and commotion over the whole Kingdom, was founded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition of the divi&s;ion and faction in the Army; which was known to be &s;o great, that it was thought <HI>Cromwell</HI> dur&s;t not draw the whole Army to a general Rendezvous, out of apprehen&s;ion that, when they &s;hould once meet together, he &s;hould no longer be ma&s;ter of them. And thence it was concluded, that, if there were in any one place &s;uch a Body brought together as might oblige <HI>Cromwell</HI> to make the Army, or a con&s;iderable part of it to march, there would at lea&s;t be no di&s;po&s;i|tion <MILESTONE N="40"> in them to fight to &s;trengthen his Authority, which they abhorr'd. And many did at that time believe, that if they had remain'd with that Party at <HI>Salisbury</HI> for &s;ome days, which they might well have done without any di&s;turbance, their Numbers would have much encrea&s;ed, and their friends farther We&s;t mu&s;t have been prepared to receive them, when their retreat had been nece&s;&s;ary by a &s;tronger part of the Armies marching again&s;t them. <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf was alarmed; he knew well the di&s;temper of the Kingdom, and in his Army, and now when he &s;aw &s;uch a Body gather'd together without any noi&s;e, that dur&s;t, in the middle of the Kingdom, enter into one of the chief Citys of it, when <MILESTONE N="50"> his Judges and all the Civil power of that County was in it, and take them Pri&s;oners, and proclaim the King in a time of full Peace, and when no Man dur&s;t &s;o much as name him but with a reproach, he could
<PB N="435" REF="4490">
not imagine, that &s;uch an enterpri&s;e could be undertaken without a univer&s;al Con&s;piracy; in which his own Army could not be innocent; and therefore knew not how to tru&s;t them together. But all this ap|prehen&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">The unfortu|nate I&s;&s;ue of $Word$</NOTE> vani&s;h'd, when it was known, that within four or five hours after they had perform'd this exploit, they left the Town with very &s;mall encrea&s;e or addition to their numbers.</P>
<P>THE truth is, they did nothing re&s;olutely after their fir&s;t Action; and were in &s;uch di&s;order, and di&s;content between them&s;elves, that without &s;taying for their friends out of <HI>Ham&s;hire</HI> (who were, to the number of two or three hundred Hor&s;e, upon their way, and would <MILESTONE N="10"> have been at <HI>Salisbury</HI> that night) upon pretence that they were ex|pected in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> they left the Town, and took the Sheriff with them, about two of the Clock in the afternoon: but were &s;o weary of their day's Labour, and their Watching the night before, that they grew le&s;s in love with what they were about, and differ'd again among&s;t them&s;elves about the Sheriff; whom many de&s;ired to be pre&s;ently re|lea&s;ed; and that Party carried it in hope of receiving good Offices after|wards from him. In this manner they continued on their march We&s;t|ward. They from <HI>Ham&s;hire,</HI> and other places, who were behind them, being angry for their leaving <HI>Salisbury,</HI> would not follow, but <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;catter'd them&s;elves; and they who were before them, and heard in what di&s;order they had left <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> likewi&s;e di&s;per&s;ed: &s;o that after they had continued their journey into <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> without meeting any who would joyn with them, Hor&s;e and Men were &s;o tired for want of meat and &s;leep, that one &s;ingle Troop of Hor&s;e, inferior in number, and commanded by an Officer of no credit in the War, being in tho&s;e parts by chance, followed them at a di&s;tance, till they were &s;o &s;pent, that he rather intreated than compell'd them to deliver them|&s;elves; &s;ome, and among&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Wagstaff,</HI> quitted their Hor&s;es, and found &s;helter in &s;ome hone&s;t Men's Hou&s;es; where they were conceal'd till opportunity &s;erv'd to tran&s;port them into the parts beyound the Seas, <MILESTONE N="30"> where they arriv'd &s;afely. But M^r <HI>Penruddock,</HI> M^r <HI>Grove,</HI> and mo&s;t of the re&s;t, were taken Pri&s;oners, upon promi&s;e given by the Officer that their Lives &s;hould be &s;aved; which they quickly found he had no Authority to make good. For <HI>Cromwell</HI> no &s;ooner heard of his cheap Victory, than he &s;ent Judges away with a new Commi&s;&s;ion of Oyer and Terminer, and Order to proceed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity again&s;t the Offenders. But <HI>Roles,</HI> his Chief Ju&s;tice, who had &s;o luckily e&s;caped at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> had not recover'd the fright; and would no more look tho&s;e Men in the face who had dealt &s;o kindly with him; but expre&s;ly <MILESTONE N="40"> refu&s;ed to be employ'd in the &s;ervice, rai&s;ing &s;ome &s;cruples in point of Law, whether the Men could be legally condemned; upon which <HI>Crom|well,</HI> &s;hortly after, turn'd him out of his Office, having found others who executed his Commands. <HI>Penruddock,</HI> and <HI>Grove,</HI> lo&s;t their heads at <HI>Exeter;</HI> and others were hanged there; who having recover'd the faintne&s;s they were in when they render'd, died with great cou|rage and re&s;olution, profe&s;&s;ing their Duty and Loyalty to the King: many were &s;ent to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and tryed and executed there, in the place where they had &s;o lately triumphed; and &s;ome who were con|demn'd, where there were Fathers, and Sons, and Brothers, that the <MILESTONE N="50"> Butchery might appear with &s;ome remor&s;e, were repriev'd, and &s;old, and &s;ent &s;laves to the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> where their treatment was &s;uch, that few of them ever return'd into their own Country. Thus this
<PB N="436" REF="4500">
little fire, which probably might have kindled and enflamed all the Kingdom, was for the pre&s;ent extingui&s;h'd in the We&s;t; and <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ecured without the help of his Army; which he &s;aw, by the coun|tenance it then &s;hew'd when they thought he &s;hould have u&s;e of them, it was high time to reform; and in that he re&s;olv'd to u&s;e no longer delay.</P>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the North, which was thought to be much better <NOTE PLACE="marg">$he $ll &s;ucce&s;$ likewi&s;e of the de&s;ign in the North&punc;</NOTE> prepared and provided for, made le&s;s noi&s;e, and expired more peace|ably. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> who &s;aw danger at a di&s;tance with great courage, and look'd upon it le&s;s re&s;olutely when it was nearer, made <MILESTONE N="1$"> his journey from <HI>London,</HI> with a friend or two, into <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> at the time appointed; and found &s;uch an appearance of Gentlemen upon the place, as might very well have de&s;erv'd his patience. There had been &s;ome mi&s;take in the Notice that had been given, and they who did ap|pear, undertook for many who were ab&s;ent, that, if he would appoint another &s;hort day for a Rendezvous, he &s;hould be well attended. <HI>Mar|maduke Darcy</HI> had &s;pent his time very well among&s;t them, and found them well di&s;po&s;ed, and there could be no danger in &s;taying the time propo&s;ed, many of them having Hou&s;es, where he might be well con|cealed, and the Country generally wi&s;h'd well to the King, and to tho&s;e who concern'd them&s;elves in his Affairs. But he took many exceptions; <MILESTONE N="20"> complain'd, as if they had deceiv'd him; and asked many Que&s;tions, which were rather rea&s;onable than &s;ea&s;onable, and which would have furni&s;h'd rea&s;ons again&s;t entring upon the de&s;ign, which were not to be urged now when they were to execute, and when indeed they &s;eem'd to have gone too far to retire. He had not yet heard of the ill Succe&s;s at <HI>Salisbury;</HI> yet he did not think the force which the Gentlemen were confident they could draw together, before they could meet with any oppo&s;ition, &s;ufficient to enter upon any Action, that was like to be dangerous in the end: So he re&s;olv'd to &s;tay no longer; the Gentlemen being as much troubled that he had come at all; they parted with little <MILESTONE N="$0"> good Will to each other, the Earl returning through by-roads to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>$he Ea$l of</HI> Roche&s;ter <HI>re|turns to</HI> Lon|don; <HI>whence $e advi&s;es the King of the ill $ucce&s;s.</HI></NOTE> which was the &s;ecure&s;t place, from whence he gave the King no|tice of the hopele&s;sne&s;s of Affairs. If he had not been a Man very for|tunate in di&s;gui&s;es, he could never have e&s;caped &s;o many perambula|tions. For as he was the lea&s;t wary in making his Journies in &s;afe hours, &s;o he departed very unwillingly from all places where there was good eating and drinking; and enter'd into Conferences with any Strangers he met, or joyn'd with.</P>
<P>WHEN he return'd from the North, he lodged at <HI>Aylesbury;</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Accident, that be$ell him in his return.</NOTE> having been ob&s;erv'd to ride out of the way in a large ground, not far <MILESTONE N="40"> from the Town, of which he &s;eem'd to take &s;ome Survey, and had asked many que&s;tions of a Country Fellow who was there (that ground in truth belonging to his own Wife) the next Ju&s;tice of Peace had notice of it; who being a Man devoted to the Government, and all that Coun|try very ill affected allways to the King, and the News of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and the Proclamation thereupon, having put all Men upon their Guard, came him&s;elf to the Inn where the Earl was; and being inform'd, that there were only two Gentlemen above at Supper (for S^r <HI>Nicholas Ar|morer</HI> was likewi&s;e with the Earl, and had accompanied him in that <MILESTONE N="50"> Journey) he went into the Stable; and upon view of the Hor&s;es found they were the &s;ame which had been ob&s;erv'd in the Ground. The Ju|&s;tice commanded the Keeper of the Inn, one <HI>Gilvy,</HI> who, be&s;ides that
<PB N="437" REF="4510">
he was a Per&s;on notoriou&s;ly affected to the Government, was likewi&s;e an Officer, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould not &s;uffer tho&s;e Hor&s;es, nor the Per&s;ons to whom they belonged, to go out of the Hou&s;e, till he, the &s;aid Ju&s;tice, came thither in the morning; when he would examine the&endq; Gentlemen,</Q> who they were, and from whence they came. The Earl was quickly adverti&s;ed of all that pa&s;&s;ed below, and enough apprehen|&s;ive of what mu&s;t follow in the morning. Whereupon he pre&s;ently &s;ent for the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and no body being pre&s;ent but his Com|panion, he told him, <Q>&startq;he would put his life into his hands; which he <MILESTONE N="10"> might de&s;troy or pre&s;erve: that he could get nothing by the one, but by the other he &s;hould have profit, and the good Will of many Friends,&endq; who might be able to do him good.</Q> Then he told him who he was; and as an earne&s;t of more benefit that he might receive hereafter, he gave him thirty or forty <HI>Jacobus</HI>'s, and a fair gold Chain, which was more worth to be &s;old than one hundred pounds. Whether the Man was moved by the reward, which he might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without de|&s;erving it, or by genero&s;ity, or by wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight, for he was a Man of a very good Under&s;tanding, and might con&s;ider the changes which follow'd after, and in which this Service prov'd of advantage to <MILESTONE N="20"> him, he did re&s;olve to permit and contrive their e&s;capes: and though he thought fit to be accountable to the Ju&s;tice for their Hor&s;es, yet he cau&s;ed two other, as good for their purpo&s;e, of his own, to be made ready by a tru&s;ty Servant in another Stable; who, about Midnight, conducted them into <HI>London-</HI>way; which put them in &s;afety. The Inn-Keeper was vi&s;ited in the morning by the Ju&s;tice; whom he carried into the Stable, where the Hor&s;es &s;till &s;tood, he having &s;till kept the Key in his own Pocket, not making any doubt of the Per&s;ons whil&s;t he kept their Hor&s;es; but the Inn-Keeper confe&s;&s;ed they were e&s;caped out of his Hou&s;e in the Night, how or whither he could not imagine. The Ju|&s;tice <MILESTONE N="30"> threaten'd loud; but the Inn-Keeper was of that unque&s;tionable fi|delity, and gave &s;uch daily demon&s;tration of his Affection to the Com|mon-wealth, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> more &s;u&s;pected the connivance of the Ju|&s;tice (who ought not to have deferr'd the examination of the Per&s;ons till the morning) than the Integrity of a Man &s;o well known as the Inn-Keeper was. The Earl remain'd in <HI>London</HI> whil&s;t the enquiry was warm and importunate, and afterwards ea&s;ily procured a pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Flan|ders;</HI> and &s;o return'd to <HI>Cologne.</HI></P>
<P>ASSOON as the King receiv'd Adverti&s;ement of the ill Succe&s;&s;es in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves</HI> Zee|land, <HI>and returns to</HI> Cologne.</NOTE> <HI>England,</HI> and that all their hopes were for the pre&s;ent bla&s;ted there, he <MILESTONE N="40"> left <HI>Zeeland,</HI> and, returning by <HI>Breda,</HI> &s;tayed in a Dorp near the Town, till the Chancellor of the Exchequer attended him; and then return'd with all &s;peed to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where his little Court was quickly gather'd together again, and better di&s;po&s;ed to &s;it &s;till, and expect God's own time. His Maje&s;ty was exceedingly afflicted with the lo&s;s of &s;o many hone&s;t Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI> who had engaged them&s;elves &s;o de&s;pe|rately, not only without, but expre&s;sly again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Judge|ment: and he was the more troubled, becau&s;e he was from &s;everal of his Friends from thence adverti&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that all his Coun&s;els were di&s;|cover'd; and that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had perfect Intelligence of what&s;oever <MILESTONE N="50"> his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to do, and of all he &s;aid Him&s;elf; &s;o that it would not be &s;afe for any Body to corre&s;pond with him, or to meddle in his Affairs or Concernments: that his coming into <HI>Zeeland,</HI> and his con|tinuance there, was known to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> with all the particulars of
<PB N="438" REF="4520">
his Motion; that many Per&s;ons of condition were &s;ei&s;ed upon, and impri&s;on'd for having a de&s;ign to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of &s;ome Towns, and Places of &s;trength; which Intelligence could not be given but&endq; from <HI>Cologne;</HI></Q> implying, <Q>&startq;that the mi&s;carriage in all the la&s;t de&s;igns, proceeded wholely from the Trea&s;on of &s;ome Per&s;ons near his Ma|je&s;ty.&endq;</Q> The King did not at all wonder that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his In&s;tru|ments, took great pains to make it generally be believ'd, that they knew all that was re&s;olv'd or thought of at <HI>Cologne;</HI> but that any Men who were really devoted to his Service, and who had kindne&s;s and e&s;teem for all tho&s;e who were tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty, &s;hould be wrought <MILESTONE N="10"> upon to believe tho&s;e reports, very much di&s;turbed him.</P>
<P>WHILST he was in this Agony, and immediately after his return to <HI>Cologne,</HI> a di&s;covery was made of a Villany, that made him excu&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Di&s;covery of the Trea|chery of</HI> Man|ning; <HI>and a particular ac|count of it.</HI></NOTE> his Friends in <HI>England</HI> for their Jealou&s;y, and yet compo&s;ed his own mind from any fear of being betrayed, it being an Impo&s;ture of &s;uch a Nature, as was dangerous and ridiculous together. There was one <HI>Manning,</HI> a proper young Gentleman, bred a Roman Catholick in the Family of the Marquis of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e Page he had been. His Father, of that Religion likewi&s;e, had been a Colonel in the King's Army; and was &s;lain at the Battle of <HI>Alresford;</HI> where this young <MILESTONE N="10"> Man, being then a Youth, was hurt, and maim'd in the left Arm and Shoulder. This Gentleman came to <HI>Cologne</HI> &s;hortly after the King came thither fir&s;t, and pretended, <Q>&startq;that he had &s;old the incumber'd fortune his Father had left him; upon which, he had enough to main|tain him, and re&s;olv'd to &s;pend it in waiting upon the King, till his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be able to rai&s;e an Army; in which he hoped to have&endq; an opportunity to revenge his Father's blood;</Q> with many di&s;cour&s;es of that Nature; and he brought a Letter to D^r <HI>Earles</HI> from his Uncle <HI>Manning,</HI> who was well known to him, to commend his Nephew to his conver&s;ation. He was a hand&s;ome Man, had &s;tore of good Cloaths, <MILESTONE N="30"> and plenty of Money; which, with the memory of his Father, ea&s;ily introduced him, and made him acceptable to the Company that was there. He knew mo&s;t of the King's Party in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;poke as if he were much tru&s;ted by them, and held corre&s;pondence with them; and had every Week the Diurnal, and the News of <HI>London,</HI> which &s;el|dom el&s;e came &s;o far as <HI>Cologne.</HI> He a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf mo&s;t with the good-fellows, and eat in their company, being well provided for the expence. By degrees, he in&s;inuated him&s;elf with the Earl of <HI>Roche|&s;ter,</HI> and told him, <Q>&startq;that all the King's Party look'd upon him, as the General who mu&s;t govern and command them; for which they were <MILESTONE N="40"> very impatient: that he him&s;elf would be ready to run his Fortune, and attend him into <HI>England;</HI> and that he had two hundred good Men li&s;ted, who would appear well mounted and armed, whenever he &s;hould require them; and that he knew where good Sums of Mo|ney&endq; lay ready to be applied to that Service.</Q> The Earl was ravi&s;hed with this di&s;cour&s;e, and look'd upon him as a Man &s;ent from Heaven to advance his de&s;igns; and asked him, <Q>&startq;whether he had been with the&endq; Chancellor of the Exchequer,</Q> and communicated all this to him? He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he had, at his fir&s;t coming to Town, waited upon the Chan|cellor; and intended to have &s;poken of this, and much more than he <MILESTONE N="50"> had yet &s;poken, if He had been vacant, or willing to hear: but he &s;eem'd to him too re&s;erv'd; which he imputed then to &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, and therefore made him a &s;econd vi&s;it; when he
<PB N="439" REF="4530">
found him with the &s;ame warine&s;s, and without a de&s;ire to be inform'd by him concerning the Affairs of that Kingdom; &s;o that he re&s;olv'd to&endq; vi&s;it him no more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN the end, he told the Earl, &startq;that he would impart a &s;ecret to him of the la&s;t importance, and which he had not yet had opportunity to inform the King of, and, he did believe, it would be the &s;ame thing to impart it to his Lord&s;hip as to his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf: the Sum was, that he was tru&s;ted by the young Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who&s;e af|fections were entire for his Maje&s;ty, to a&s;&s;ure the King of the fame; <MILESTONE N="10"> and that though it would not be &s;afe for him to appear in the head, and beginning of an In&s;urrection, he would advance it as much as if he were there in Per&s;on; and becau&s;e he knew the We&s;t was better prepared to begin the Work than any other part of the Kingdom, he had cau&s;ed three thou&s;and pounds to be laid a&s;ide, and kept ready at <HI>Wilton,</HI> which &s;hould be deliver'd to any Man, who, in the King's&endq; Name,</Q> <Q>&s;hould require it of &s;uch a Man (naming a Per&s;on, who was known to be much tru&s;ted by that Earl) &startq;upon delivery of a private&endq; Token he produced out of his Pocket (which was a clean piece of Paper,</Q> &s;ealed with three impre&s;&s;ions of an Antick head in hard Wax) <MILESTONE N="20"> <Q>&startq;&endq;which,</Q> <Q>he &s;aid, &startq;the Earl required him to pre&s;ent to the King when&endq; he thought it might be &s;ea&s;onable.</Q> <Q>He added, &startq;that he would be glad to be him&s;elf in that fir&s;t engagement, and &s;o to be pre&s;ent when that Token &s;hould be deliver'd; yet he con&s;ider'd, that he was not enough known to have &s;uch a Secret imparted to him, as the time of &s;uch an action ought to be; and therefore, if it plea&s;ed the King, he would pre&s;ently deliver that Token into his Lord&s;hip's hands; who, he was confident, would be the fir&s;t that would have opportunity to&endq; employ it.</Q></P>
<P>THE Earl had the journey then in his head, which he made &s;hortly <MILESTONE N="30"> after; and thought &s;uch a Trea&s;ure as this would much advance the &s;ervice. He made ha&s;t to inform the King of the whole, that he might have his approbation to receive the Token. To that purpo&s;e, he brought the Man to the King; who had never before taken other notice of him, than for his bringing the Diurnal con&s;tantly to be read to his Maje&s;ty after dinner, or &s;upper, as he receiv'd it. He made a large Relation to the King of what the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> had commanded him to &s;ay, and pre&s;ented the Token to his Maje&s;ty for the three thou&s;and pounds; the manner of his di&s;cour&s;e being &s;uch, as the King had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the truth of it. A&s;&s;oon as he left the King, the Earl <MILESTONE N="40"> brought him to the Chancellor, conjuring him to u&s;e him with great kindne&s;s, and gently reproaching him for his want of Courte&s;y to him before; which he wonder'd at; for it was very true that <HI>Manning</HI> had vi&s;ited him twice before, and it was as true, that he had receiv'd him with as much civility as was po&s;&s;ible, having known his Father, and mo&s;t of his Family, and was glad to &s;ee him frequently at Prayers, well knowing that he had been bred a Roman Catholick; and the young Man had &s;eem'd much plea&s;ed with the Reception he had given him. But from that time that he made that Relation concerning the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> which he repeated over to him as he had related it <MILESTONE N="50"> to the King, the Chancellor allways &s;u&s;pected him; and could not pre|vail with him&s;elf to have any familiarity with him; which the other complained heavily of, and the Chancellor was much reproached for not treating a Per&s;on of &s;o much merit, who had lo&s;t his Father and
<PB N="440" REF="4540">
been him&s;elf maim'd in the King's Service, with more openne&s;s; for he did allways u&s;e him with all nece&s;&s;ary civility. But the Chancellor's knowledge of the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and of the humour that then po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him, and of the unea&s;ine&s;s of his own fortune, which did not make him at that time Ma&s;ter of much Money, be&s;ides that he be|lieved that, if the thing were true, he &s;hould have receiv'd adverti&s;e|ment &s;ooner of it from a Per&s;on who was mo&s;t tru&s;ted by the Earl, and who corre&s;ponded very con&s;tantly with the Chancellor, made him di&s;tru&s;t him. <Q>He therefore told the King, &startq;that he doubted <HI>Manning&endq;</HI> had made that part of the &s;tory to make him&s;elf the more welcome;</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"> which his Maje&s;ty did not think was a rea&s;onable jealou&s;y; but wi&s;h'd him to u&s;e all the means he could to di&s;cover the truth. The Chan|cellor had no farther &s;u&s;picion of him than upon the account of that &s;tory, nor the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion that he was a Spy.</P>
<P>WHEN it was publickly known that the King was ab&s;ent from <HI>Co|logne,</HI> at that time that he made his journey to <HI>Zeeland,</HI> in the man|ner that is mention'd before, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> being departed from thence &s;ome time before, M^r <HI>Manning</HI> appear'd wonderfully troubled, and complain'd to &s;ome, <Q>&startq;that he being entru&s;ted by all the King's friends, who would not credit any Orders but &s;uch as &s;hould pa&s;s <MILESTONE N="20"> through his hands, the King was now gone without imparting it to&endq; him;</Q> which would be the ruin of his de&s;ign. <Q>He went to the Chan|cellor, and lamented him&s;elf, &startq;that there &s;hould be any Sword drawn in <HI>England</HI> before His; his Father's blood boiled within him and&endq; kept him from &s;leep.</Q> <Q>He de&s;ired him therefore, &startq;that he would &s;o far communicate the de&s;ign to him, that he might only know to what part of <HI>England</HI> to tran&s;port him&s;elf, that he might be in action a&s;&s;oon&endq; as might be po&s;&s;ible.</Q> <Q>He could draw nothing from the Chancellor; who told him, &startq;that he knew of no probability of any action; and&endq; therefore could give no advice.</Q> Upon which he complain'd much <MILESTONE N="30"> of the Chancellor's want of kindne&s;s to him: but he lo&s;t no time in following the King; and having great acquaintance with <HI>Herbert Price,</HI> a Man much tru&s;ted by the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and that affected to know, or to be thought to know the greate&s;t &s;ecrets, he prevail'd with him, upon bearing his Charges, to accompany him, that they might find out where the King was, at lea&s;t that they might be ready on the Sea Coa&s;t, to tran&s;port them&s;elves into <HI>England</HI> upon the fir&s;t occa&s;ion. Whether by accident, or that the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> had made any mention of <HI>Zee|land</HI> to M^r <HI>Price,</HI> thither they both came; and &s;eeing S^r <HI>John Mennes,</HI> and M^r <HI>Nicholas</HI> there, they believ'd there might likewi&s;e be others of <MILESTONE N="40"> their <HI>Cologne</HI> friends. <HI>Herbert Price,</HI> as he was a Man of a very in|qu&s;itive nature, watch'd &s;o narrowly, that he found an opportunity to meet the King in an evening, when he u&s;ed to walk to take a little air after the day's confinement. <Q>The King, &s;ince he was di&s;cover'd, thought it be&s;t to tru&s;t him; and charged him not only &startq;to make no di&s;covery, but to remove out of the I&s;land, le&s;t his being &s;een there, might&endq; rai&s;e &s;u&s;picion in other Men.</Q> He did very importunately de&s;ire the King that he might bring <HI>Manning</HI> to &s;peak with him, as not only an hone&s;t Man (as no doubt he thought him to be) but a Man of that im|portance and tru&s;t, as might contribute much to his pre&s;ent &s;ervice. <MILESTONE N="50"> But the King would by no means admit him, nor did he &s;ee him; yet afterwards, upon this reflection, his Maje&s;ty concluded that <HI>Cromwell</HI> came to be inform'd of his being in <HI>Zeeland,</HI> without any reproach to
<PB N="441" REF="4550">
M^r <HI>Price</HI>'s fidelity; which was not &s;u&s;pected, though his pre&s;umption, and importunity, were allways very inconvenient.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after the King's return to <HI>Cologne, Manning</HI> likewi&s;e came thither with his accu&s;tom'd confidence. <Q>And in this time the Chancellor receiv'd Adverti&s;ement from <HI>England,</HI> &startq;that he had no kind of tru&s;t from the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> but on the contrary, had been turn'd out of his Service upon matter of di&s;hone&s;ty; and that he was&endq; a loo&s;e Per&s;on, of no Reputation:</Q> <Q>and his Maje&s;ty was inform'd by others from <HI>Antwerp,</HI> &startq;that every Po&s;t brought many Letters for him, <MILESTONE N="10"> which were taken up there, and tran&s;mitted to <HI>Cologne;</HI> and that he had Letters of credit upon a Merchant of <HI>Antwerp</HI> for good Sums of&endq; Money.</Q> All this rai&s;ed a &s;u&s;picion in the King; who gave direction to a tru&s;ty Per&s;on, who was purpo&s;ely &s;ent to take up all tho&s;e Letters at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which were &s;ent thither from <HI>England</HI> for him, it being known under what cover they came, and likewi&s;e tho&s;e which were &s;ent from <HI>Cologne</HI> by him, his addre&s;s being likewi&s;e di&s;cover'd. By this means the Party return'd with many great Packets both from, and to him; which being open'd, and read, admini&s;ter'd matter of great amazement. There were Letters from <HI>Thurlow, Cromwell</HI>'s Secretary <MILESTONE N="20"> and principal Mini&s;ter, containing the &s;atisfaction the Protector re|ceiv'd in the particular Intelligence he receiv'd from him, with &s;hort In&s;tructions how he &s;hould behave him&s;elf. The Per&s;on employ'd had been &s;o dextrous, that he brought with him <HI>Manning</HI>'s Letters of three Po&s;ts, all full of the mo&s;t particular things done at <HI>Cologne;</HI> and the particular words &s;aid by the King, and Others, that mu&s;t needs affect tho&s;e who &s;hould receive the Intelligence; but of all which there was nothing true; no &s;uch Action had been done, no &s;uch word &s;poken.</P>
<P><Q>IN one Letter, after &s;uch information as he thought fit, he &s;aid, &startq;that by the next he &s;hould &s;end &s;uch advice as was of much more mo|ment <MILESTONE N="30"> than he had ever yet &s;ent, and above what he had given from <HI>Zeeland,</HI> and by which they might &s;ee, that there was nothing &s;o &s;e|cret at <HI>Cologne,</HI> of which he could not be inform'd, if he had Money&endq; enough;</Q> and therefore de&s;ired the Bill for the thou&s;and Crowns might be di&s;patched. Together with this, the Letter of the &s;ub&s;equent Po&s;t was likewi&s;e &s;ei&s;ed upon; and by his Method, which was afterwards di&s;cover'd, it was very probable that they were both &s;ent at one and the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame Po&s;t, though they were of &s;everal dates. That of the latter date was very long, and in it was enclo&s;ed an Over|ture or De&s;ign for the &s;urpri&s;e and taking of <HI>Plymouth;</HI> in which there <MILESTONE N="40"> was a very exact and true de&s;cription of the Town, and Fort, and I&s;land, and the pre&s;ent &s;trength and Force that was there. Then a propo&s;ition, that a Ve&s;&s;el with five hundred Men (there were no more de&s;ired) &s;hould come to &s;uch a place (a Creek de&s;cribed) and upon a &s;ign then given, &s;uch a place in the Town &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;ei&s;ed upon, whil&s;t others &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s both the Fort, and the I&s;land. The Names of the Per|&s;ons who undertook to do both the one, and the other, were likewi&s;e &s;et down; and they were all Men known to be well affected to the King, who, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that five hundred Men, might indeed be able to ma&s;ter the place. For the better going through the Work when it was <MILESTONE N="50"> thus begun, there was an undertaking that S^r <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> and other Per&s;ons named, who were all notable Men for their Zeal to the King's Service, &s;hould be ready from the <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> &s;ide, as Colonel <HI>Arundel</HI> and others from <HI>Cornwal,</HI> to &s;econd and &s;upport what was to be done.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="4560">
<Q>THE Letter inform'd, &startq;that when the King deliver'd that Paper to&endq; the Council (which, he &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;&endq;he had receiv'd from a very good hand;</Q> and then the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> made this, and this objection, and others found this, and that difficulty in the Execution of the Enterpri&s;e, all which the Chancellor an&s;wer'd very clearly, <Q>and the King him&s;elf &s;aid very much of the ea&s;ine&s;s of the Undertaking) &startq;there was one dif|ficulty urged, that the King him&s;elf appear'd to be &s;tartled at, and look'd upon the Chancellor; who aro&s;e from his place, and went to the King's Chair, and whi&s;per'd &s;omewhat in his Ear Whereupon his Maje&s;ty told the Lords, that he had indeed forgot &s;omewhat that the Chancellor put him in mind of, and for that particular they &s;hould refer the care of it to Him, who would take it upon him; and &s;o the matter was re&s;olv'd, and the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> undertook for the five&endq; hundred Men, and their tran&s;portation.</Q> <Q><HI>Manning</HI> concluded, &startq;that if he had Money, they &s;hould know con&s;tantly how this de&s;ign &s;hould&endq; be advanced, or any other &s;et on foot.</Q> Every Body was exceedingly amazed at this relation, in which there was not one &s;yllable of truth. There had never &s;uch a Propo&s;ition been made, nor was there any &s;uch debate or di&s;cour&s;e. There were in his Letter many vain in&s;inuations of his Intere&s;t, as if he were never out of the King's company. Two <MILESTONE N="20"> of the King's Servants were &s;ent to &s;ei&s;e upon his Per&s;on, and his Pa|pers; who found him in his Chamber writing, and his Cipher and Pa|pers before him; all which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of without any re&s;i&s;tance. There were &s;everal Letters prepared, and made up with the dates proper for many Po&s;ts to come, with information, and intelligence, of the &s;ame nature as the former.</P>
<P><Q>THE Secretary of State, and one of the Lords of the Council, were &s;ent to examine him; to whom he confe&s;&s;ed, without any re&s;erve, &startq;that the Nece&s;&s;ity of his Fortune had expo&s;ed him to that ba&s;e condition of life; and, to make him&s;elf fit for it, he had di&s;&s;embled his Reli|gion; <MILESTONE N="30"> for, he &s;aid, he remain'd &s;till a Catholick: that he was &s;ent over by <HI>Thurlow</HI> to be a Spy wherever the King &s;hould be, and had con|&s;tantly &s;ent him Intelligence, for which he had receiv'd good Sums of Money; yet, that he had been &s;o troubled in mind for the vilene&s;s of the life he led, that he was re&s;olv'd, by rai&s;ing great expectations in them, to draw a good Sum of Money from them; and then to re|nounce farther corre&s;pondence, and to procure the King's pardon, and&endq; faithfully to &s;erve him.</Q> <Q>Being asked, why he made &s;uch Relations, which had no truth in them, he an&s;wer'd, &startq;that if he had come to the knowledge of any thing which in truth had concern'd the King, he <MILESTONE N="40"> would never have di&s;cover'd it; but he thought it would do no pre|judice to the King, if he got Money from the Rebels by &s;ending them Lies, which could neither do Them good, nor hurt his Maje&s;ty; and therefore all his care was to amu&s;e them with particulars, which he knew would plea&s;e them; and &s;o when he was alone he allways pre|pared Letters containing &s;uch things as occurr'd to his Invention, to be &s;ent by the &s;ucceeding Po&s;ts, and that he had never written any thing that was true, but of his Maje&s;ty's being in <HI>Zeeland;</HI> which, he&endq; believ'd, could produce no prejudice to him.</Q></P>
<P>THE King now di&s;cern'd from whence all the Apprehen&s;ions of his <MILESTONE N="50"> Friends proceeded; and that they had too much ground for their Jea|lou&s;ies; for though none of his Coun&s;els had been di&s;cover'd, they who had receiv'd tho&s;e Letters, might rea&s;onably think that none of them
<PB N="443" REF="4570">
were concealed; and might well brag to their Confidents of their know|ing all that the King did. By this means, &s;uch particulars were tran&s;|mitted to the King's Friends, as could not but very much amu&s;e them, and, no doubt, was the cau&s;e of the commitment of very many Per|&s;ons, and of &s;ome who had no purpo&s;e to &s;uffer for their Loyalty. His Maje&s;ty took care to publi&s;h the Tran&s;actions of this Man, with the Me|thod of the Intelligence he gave; by which his Friends di&s;cern'd with what &s;hadows they had been affrighted, and his Enemies likewi&s;e di&s;|cover'd what current ware they had receiv'd for their Money: yet they <MILESTONE N="10"> endeavour'd to have it believ'd that he was not a Man &s;ent over by Them, but a Secretary in great tru&s;t about &s;ome Per&s;on employed, whom they had corrupted: in which Men were likewi&s;e quickly undeceiv'd, and knew that he was a Man without any dependence or relation to, or coun|tenance from the Court: and the Wretch, &s;oon after, receiv'd the reward due to his Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>As the King's hopes were much eclip&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> by the late un|&s;ea&s;onable Attempt, and the lo&s;s of &s;o many gallant Per&s;ons, as peri&s;h'd, or were undone in it; &s;o <HI>Cromwell</HI> advanced his own credit, and was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell's <HI>Advantage by the Ri&s;ings of the King's Party:</HI></NOTE> very much enrich'd by it, and more confirm'd with tho&s;e who were of <MILESTONE N="20"> doubtful Faith towards him. He lay before under the reproach of de|vi&s;ing Plots him&s;elf, that the Common-wealth might be thought in dan|ger, to the end he might have excu&s;e to continue &s;o va&s;t Forces &s;till in pay. Whereas it now appear'd how Active, and confident the King's Party &s;till was, and that they would not have had the pre&s;umption to make &s;o bold an Attempt in the middle of the Kingdom, if they had not had good a&s;&s;urance of being &s;econded; and therefore they were to look upon the fire as only raked up, not extingui&s;h'd. The Succe&s;s and Triumph of a few de&s;perate Per&s;ons at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> that had produced &s;uch a con&s;ternation throughout the Kingdom, and would have endanger'd <MILESTONE N="30"> the &s;ecurity of the whole We&s;t, if there had not happen'd &s;ome Acci|dental confu&s;ion among&s;t the Undertakers, was evidence enough that there was not yet force &s;ufficient to provide for the &s;afety of the King|dom; and therefore that it was nece&s;&s;ary to make better provi&s;ion for the quiet of every County, that it might not be endanger'd by every bold Attempt: and the charge that this nece&s;&s;ary defence would cau&s;e, &s;hould in Ju&s;tice be borne by tho&s;e who were the Occa&s;ion of the Expence.</P>
<P><Q>THEREUPON he made by his own Authority, and that of his Coun|cil, an Order, &startq;that all tho&s;e who had ever borne Armes for the King, or had declar'd them&s;elves to be of the Royal Party &s;hould be decimated, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Order for Decimating the King's Party</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> that is, pay a tenth part of all that E&s;tate which they had left, to &s;up|port the charge which the Common-wealth was put to, by the unquiet|ne&s;s of their Temper, and the ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Jealou&s;y which they had&endq; admini&s;ter'd.</Q> And that the Publick might lo&s;e nothing of what he had &s;o frankly given to it, Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed in every County, to value what that tenth part of every &s;uch E&s;tate did amount to; and that no Man might have too good a bargain of his own, every Man was obliged to pay as much as tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners judged fit; and till he paid a, be&s;ides Impri&s;onment, which was a judgement a part, and inflicted once or twice a year, as the jealou&s;ies wrought, his whole E&s;tate was &s;eque&s;ter'd. <MILESTONE N="50"> And in this decimation there was no con&s;ideration taken of former Com|po&s;itions, of any Articles of War, or of any Acts of pardon and indemnity, which had been granted under their great Seal, without enquiry into their Actions, or &s;o much as accu&s;ing any of them of any crime or guilt, or of
<PB N="444" REF="4580">
having any Corre&s;pondence with the King or any body tru&s;ted by him; or that they were in any degree privy to the late de&s;igns or in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>THAT this Order might be &s;ubmitted to, and executed, He publi&s;h'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Declara|tion to ju&s;ti|fy it.</NOTE> a Declaration to make the Ju&s;tice, as well as the Nece&s;&s;ity of that pro|ceeding appear; in which he did not only &s;et down the grounds of his pre&s;ent proceeding again&s;t the Royal Party, but the rules by which he meant to proceed again&s;t any other Party that &s;hould provoke, or give him trouble. It was a Declaration worded and dige&s;ted with much more a&s;perity again&s;t all who had &s;erved the King, than had ever been before publi&s;hed. Great caution had been hitherto u&s;ed, as if nothing more <MILESTONE N="10"> had been de&s;ign'd that to unite the whole Nation in the joynt defence of the Common Intere&s;t, and as if a re&s;olution had been taken to have abo|li&s;hed all Marks of di&s;unition and di&s;tinction of Parties, and that all Men, of what condition &s;oever (except tho&s;e who had been allways excepted by name) who would &s;ubmit to the Government, &s;hould be admitted to have &s;hares, and to act parts in the admini&s;tration and de|fence of it. <Q>But now notice was taken of &startq;&s;uch an inherent malignity, and irreconcilablene&s;s in all tho&s;e who from the beginning had adhered to the King, and oppo&s;ed the proceedings of the Parliament, towards all tho&s;e who had &s;erved their Country, and vindicated the Intere&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> of the People and Nation, that they declined the common rules of ci|vility, and would have no conver&s;ation with them; and, that the &s;ame Malice and Animo&s;ity might de&s;cend to their Po&s;terity, they would not make Marriages, or any friend&s;hip or alliance with tho&s;e who had been &s;eparated, or divided from them in tho&s;e publick differences; and therefore they were not hereafter to wonder, or complain, if they were looked upon as a Common Enemy, which mu&s;t be kept from being able to do mi&s;chief; &s;ince they would allways be willing to do all they could; and that they were not to expect to be pro&s;ecuted, like other Men, by the ordinary forms of Ju&s;tice, and to have their <MILESTONE N="30"> Crimes to be proved by Witne&s;&s;es, before they &s;hould be concluded to be guilty. If any de&s;perate Attempts were undertaken by any of that Party to di&s;turb the publick Peace; that it would be rea&s;onable to conclude that they all wi&s;hed well to it, though they appeared not to own it: that all Con&s;piracies of that nature were acted in &s;ecret, and were deeds of darkne&s;s, and Men might ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected and proceeded again&s;t as privy to them, by their common di&s;cour&s;es, by&endq; the Company they u&s;ually kept, and by their very looks;</Q> with many other expre&s;&s;ions, of &s;uch an unu&s;ual nature in the di&s;qui&s;ition of Ju&s;tice, and legal proceedings, that the King's Party might rea&s;onably conclude, <MILESTONE N="40"> they had nothing left that they could call their own, but mu&s;t expect a total extirpation, either by ma&s;&s;acre, or tran&s;plantation.</P>
<P><Q>BUT then the Declaration took notice likewi&s;e of &startq;the factions in the Army, that would not acquie&s;ce in the Government e&s;tabli&s;h'd; but would have another found out, and formed according to their Le|velling humours; all which di&s;tractions, to what other ends &s;oever directed, mu&s;t &s;o weaken the Common-wealth, if not wi&s;ely prevented, as it mu&s;t in the end be expo&s;ed as a Prey to their inveterate Enemies; and therefore, that the &s;ame remedies mu&s;t be apply'd to Them, as to&endq; the others;</Q> with intimation clear enough, <Q>&startq;that the connivance they <MILESTONE N="50"> had formerly receiv'd, and even the Pardons that had been granted for their former Mutinies and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, were of no more validity than the Articles, Promi&s;es, and Acts of Indemnity, which had been
<PB N="445" REF="4590">
granted to the Royal Party: all which were declared to be void and&endq; null, upon any &s;ucceeding Delinquency:</Q> &s;o that all di&s;contented Peo|ple who liked not the pre&s;ent Government, what part &s;oever they had acted in the pulling down the old, whether Presbyterian, Independent, or Leveller, were left to con&s;ider of the con&s;equence of tho&s;e Maxims there laid down; and might naturally conclude, that they were in no better condition of &s;ecurity for what they enjoy'd, and had purcha&s;ed dear|ly, than tho&s;e who by their help were brought to the lowe&s;t mi&s;ery; though, for the pre&s;ent, none but the King's Party underwent that in|&s;upportable <MILESTONE N="10"> burthen of Decimation; which brought a va&s;t incredible Sum of Money into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Coffers, the greater part whereof was rai&s;ed (which was a kind of plea&s;ure, though not ea&s;e, to the re&s;t) upon tho&s;e who never did, nor ever would have given the King the lea&s;t a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and were only reputed to be of his Party becau&s;e they had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Rebels with a vi&s;ible chearfulne&s;s, or in any con&s;iderable pro|portion; and had propo&s;ed to them&s;elves to &s;it &s;till as Neuters, and not to be at any charge with reference to either Party; or &s;uch who had &s;helter'd them&s;elves in &s;ome of the King's Garri&s;ons for their own conveniency.</P>
<P>THIS Declaration was &s;ent to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where the King cau&s;ed an An|&s;wer <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King cau&s;ed an An|&s;wer to be made to it</NOTE> to be made to it upon the grounds that were laid down in it; and as if it were made by one who had been allways of the Parliament &s;ide, and who was well plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Cavaliers reduced to that extremity; but with &s;uch reflections upon the Tyranny that was exerci&s;ed over the King|dom, and upon the foulne&s;s of the breach of Tru&s;t the Protector was guilty of, that it obliged all the Nation to look upon him as a dete&s;table Enemy, who was to be removed by any way that offer'd it &s;elf; many of which ar|guments were made u&s;e of again&s;t him in the next Parliament that he call'd; which was not long after.</P>

Regal Government, to which they had been &s;ubject ever &s;ince they were a Nation: in &s;eeing the pride and in&s;olence of that People, which had u&s;ed to practice &s;uch ill manners towards their King, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, contemned, and expo&s;ed to &s;lavery under the di&s;cipline, and ca&s;tigation of Men who were very few of them born Gentlemen, but bred up in the trades and profe&s;&s;ions of Common Men. The&s;e Men govern'd in their Hou&s;es, and pre&s;cribed new Laws to them to live by, which they had never been accu&s;tom'd to, yet were compell'd to obey, upon pe|nalty of their Lives, and E&s;tates; whil&s;t their adored Idol, Presbytery, which had pull'd off the Crown from the head of the King, was trod <MILESTONE N="10"> under foot, and laugh'd at; and their Preachers, who had threaten'd their Princes with their rude thunder of Excommunication, di&s;puted with, &s;coffed at, and controled by Artificers, and corrected by the &s;trokes and blows of a Corporal; and all this Subjection &s;upported at their own charge, their fierce Governours being paid by them out of their own E&s;tates.</P>
<P>HE then beheld <HI>Ireland,</HI> that begun its Rebellion with inhumane <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> Ma&s;&s;acres, and Butcheries of their peaceable and innocent Neighbours, after the other of <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or &s;o compounded, that the ble&s;&s;ing of Peace had again cover'd the three Nations, if this &s;otti&s;h Peo|ple <MILESTONE N="20"> had not, without any provocation, but of their own folly and bar|barity, with that bloody prologue engaged again the three Kingdoms in a raging and devouring War; &s;o that though <HI>Scotland</HI> blew the fir&s;t Trumpet, it was <HI>Ireland</HI> that drew the fir&s;t blood; and if they had not at that time rebell'd, and in that manner, it is very probable all the mi|&s;eries which afterwards befel the King, and his Dominions, had been prevented. The&s;e unhappy People, when they &s;aw that they could not make War, but were beaten as often as encounter'd, would not yet make Peace; or if they did, they no &s;ooner made it than broke it, with all the circum&s;tances of treachery, and perjury, that can make any &s;oul <MILESTONE N="30"> Action the mo&s;t odious. And after they had, for their la&s;t pre&s;ervation, return'd to their obedience to the King, and put them&s;elves again un|der his Protection, they quickly repented of their Loyalty, offer'd them|&s;elves to the Soveraignty of a foreign Prince; and when they had &s;een their natural King murther'd by his other Rebels, for want of that A&s;|&s;i&s;tance which they might have given him, cho&s;e rather to depend on the clemency of the U&s;urper, driving from them the Governour, and Government of the King: I &s;ay, his Maje&s;ty &s;aw now this mi&s;erable People groveling at the feet of their proud Conquerors, reduced to the lowe&s;t de&s;olation, and even to the point of Extirpation; the blood they had wantonly, and &s;avagely &s;pilt in the beginning of the Rebellion, now plentifully revenged in &s;treams of their own blood, from one end of the Kingdom to the other; whil&s;t tho&s;e Per&s;ons who fir&s;t contriv'd the Re|bellion, and could never be reached by the King, and they who cau&s;ed every Peace to be broken which had been made with his Maje&s;ty, with all the po&s;&s;ible affronts to his Royal dignity and authority, after they had endeavour'd, by all the treacherous Offices again&s;t the Royal Power, to reconcile them&s;elves to their new Ma&s;ters, were every day taken, and infamou&s;ly put to death by Their authority who u&s;urped the Go|vernment; who &s;old, as hath been &s;aid before, &s;o many thou&s;ands of <MILESTONE N="50"> them to the &s;ervices of foreign Princes, under whom they peri&s;h'd for want of bread, and without regard: &s;o that there is not an account in Hi&s;tory of any Nation, the Jews only excepted, that was ever reduced

to a more complete mi&s;ery than the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were at this time. And all this was the more extraordinary, in that it was without the pity of any, all the world looking upon them as de&s;erving the fate they under|went.</P>
<P>LASTLY <HI>England,</HI> that &s;eem'd to glory in the Conque&s;t of tho&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>of</HI> England</NOTE> two Kingdoms, and to reign peaceably over them, yielded a pro&s;pect too, full of variety. Though the King's heart was even broken with the daily informations he receiv'd of the ruin and de&s;truction his faith|ful and Loyal party underwent; and the butchery frequently acted <MILESTONE N="10"> upon them, and the extreme Tyranny the U&s;urper exerci&s;ed over the whole Nation, was grievous to him, yet he could not be equally af|flicted to &s;ee tho&s;e who had been the fir&s;t Authors of the publick Cala|mity, now &s;o much &s;harers in it that they were no more Ma&s;ters of their E&s;tates, than They were whom they had fir&s;t &s;poiled; and that them&s;elves were brought and expo&s;ed upon tho&s;e Scaffolds, which they had cau&s;ed to be erected for others; that little or no part of the new Government was in their hands which had pull'd down the old; and that, after Monarchy had been made &s;o odious to the People, the whole Wealth of the Nation was become at the di&s;po&s;al of a &s;ingle Per&s;on; <MILESTONE N="20"> and that tho&s;e Lords, without who&s;e mon&s;trous a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Scepter could never have been wre&s;ted out of the hands of the King, were now number'd and mar&s;hall'd with the dregs of the People: in a word, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not &s;o jealous of any, as of tho&s;e who had rai&s;ed him; and contriv'd, and propo&s;ed nothing more to him&s;elf, than to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e, or to drive them out of the Kingdom, who had been the prin|cipal means to &s;uppre&s;s the Royal Authority, and to drive the Royal Family, and all that adher'd to it, into bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>THIS pro&s;pect the King had of the three Kingdoms during his re&s;i|dence at <HI>Cologne;</HI> but with tho&s;e manife&s;tations of God's Vengeance <MILESTONE N="30"> upon tho&s;e ingrateful Nations, of which he had a mo&s;t tender and com|pa&s;&s;ionate feeling, he was not without &s;ome glimmering light to di&s;|cern an approach of that recompence, which the divine ju&s;tice u&s;ually a&s;&s;igns to tho&s;e who patiently attend his vindication.</P>
<P>CROMWELL, who&s;e great heart was &s;ollicitous to extend the terror of his Name into foreign Countries, by which method he thought to render the rough and &s;tubborn humours of the People at home more ob&s;equious to him, had, in the beginning of the year 1655, after his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>in the beginning of</HI> 1655 <HI>&s;ent two great Fleets to Sea the one under</HI> Pen, <HI>with a Land Army under</HI> Vena|bles</NOTE> di&s;&s;olution of his refractory Parliament, &s;ent two very great Fleets to Sea; the one under <HI>Pen,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about thirty Ships of War, with <MILESTONE N="40"> which there was likewi&s;e embarked a Land Army, con&s;i&s;ting of four or five thou&s;and Foot, and two Troops of Hor&s;e, under the Command of General <HI>Venables,</HI> a Gentleman of a good family in <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI> who had &s;erved long in the Army in the condition of a Colonel, and was then call'd out of <HI>Ireland</HI> to command in this Expedition.</P>
<P>BOTH the&s;e &s;uperior Officers were well affected to the King's Ser|vice, and were not &s;ond of the Enterpri&s;e they were to conduct, the nature of which they yet knew nothing of. They did, by &s;everal ways, without any communication with each other (which they had not con|fidence to engage in) &s;end to the King, that if he were ready with any <MILESTONE N="50"> Force from abroad, or &s;ecure of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any Port within, they would, that is either of them would, engage, with the power that was under their charge, to declare for his Maje&s;ty. If this had been upon a joynt, and mutual confidence in each other, and that both Fleet, and Land
<PB N="452" REF="4640">
Forces, though the Body of Hor&s;e was &s;mall, would at the &s;ame time have &s;et up the King's Standard, it might have been the foundation of &s;ome hopeful expectation. But neither of them daring to tru&s;t the other, the King could not pre&s;ume upon any Port; without which neither had promi&s;ed to engage; nor could he make out of the di&s;tinct Overtures (however he might hope to unite them) &s;uch a probable At|tempt, after the mi&s;carriage of &s;o many, as to embark his friends in. So he wi&s;hed them to re&s;erve their Affections for his Maje&s;ty, till a more proper &s;ea&s;on to di&s;cover them; and to pro&s;ecute the Voyage to which they were de&s;ign'd; from which he was not without hope of &s;ome <MILESTONE N="10"> benefit to him&s;elf; for it was evident <HI>Cromwell</HI> meant to make &s;ome Enemy, which probably might give his Maje&s;ty &s;ome Friend.</P>
<P>THE other Fleet was not inferior in naval &s;trength, and power, but <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The other Fleet under</HI> Blake.</NOTE> was without a Land Army; and that was committed to the Command of <HI>Blake;</HI> in whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> had all confidence. Neither Fleet knew what the other, or what it &s;elf was to do, till each of them came to &s;uch a Point; where they were to open their Commi&s;&s;ions; and <HI>Crom|well</HI> had communicated his purpo&s;e for either to &s;o very few, that, for many Months after they were both at Sea, no body knew to what they were de&s;ign'd. Though the intercour&s;e between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20"> the Cardinal was maintain'd with many civilities, and &s;ome confidence, yet there was nothing of a Treaty &s;igned; he re&s;olving, as he profe&s;&s;ed, <Q>&startq;&endq;to give his friend&s;hip to that Crown that &s;hould be&s;t de&s;erve it:</Q> and, without doubt, both Crowns were amu&s;ed with his preparations, and &s;ollicitous to know where the &s;torm would fall.</P>
<P>SPAIN, that had hitherto kept <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> after he had &s;o many years re&s;ided there as Emba&s;&s;adour to the late King, believing they were le&s;s faulty in that, than if they &s;hould &s;end ano|ther originally to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> now thought it nece&s;&s;ary to omit no occa|&s;ion to endear them&s;elves to him: and therefore they &s;ent the Marquis <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Leyda <HI>&s;ent Emba&s;&s;adour by</HI> Spain <HI>to</HI> Cromwell, <HI>who after a Month re|turns to</HI> Flan|ders.</NOTE> of <HI>Leyda</HI> with a &s;plendid train, as extraordinary Emba&s;&s;adour, to con|gratulate all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and to offer him the entire friend&s;hip of the Catholick King. The Marquis, who was a wi&s;e and a jealous Man, found by his reception, and <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s re&s;ervation in all his Audiences, and the approaches he could make, that there was no room left for his Ma&s;ter; and &s;o after a Month &s;pent there, he return'd to look to his Government in <HI>Flanders,</HI> with an expectation that a&s;&s;oon as any News came of the Fleets, they &s;hould hear of &s;ome Acts of Ho&s;tility upon the Subjects of <HI>Spain;</HI> and did all he could to awaken all the Mini&s;ters of that King to the &s;ame apprehen&s;ion, and expectation. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THE two Fleets &s;et out from the coa&s;t of <HI>England;</HI> that under <HI>Blake,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet un|der</HI> Blake <HI>goes into the</HI> Me|diterranean.</NOTE> &s;ome Months before the other; and made it's cour&s;e directly to the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> being bound in the fir&s;t place to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;olence of tho&s;e of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> who had infe&s;ted the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, and were grown powerful in tho&s;e Seas. When he &s;hould have per|form'd that Service, he was to open another Commi&s;&s;ion, which would inform him what cour&s;e he was to &s;teer: the other Fleet under <HI>Pen</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That under</HI> Pen <HI>to the</HI> Barbadoes.</NOTE> was bound directly to the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> where they were to open their Commi&s;&s;ions, and to deliver Letters to that Governour.

alacrity in the Planters of tho&s;e <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands, which were over&s;tock'd with Inhabitants, to &s;eek their Fortune farther from home. So that, after a &s;horter &s;tay at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> than they had rea&s;on to expect, having now found there two Frigats (which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;ent before to prepare all things ready, and to put &s;everal Shallops toge|ther, which were brought ready in quarters) and making prize of about forty <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, belonging to their new Allies of <HI>Holland,</HI> for trading thither (contrary to the Act of Navigation) about the end of <HI>March</HI> they &s;et &s;ail, with an addition of four or five thou&s;and Foot for the <MILESTONE N="10"> Land Army, towards S^r <HI>Chri&s;tophers;</HI> where, after a &s;hort &s;tay, they receiv'd about fifteen hundred Men more: &s;o that <HI>Venables</HI> had now under his Command a Body of above nine thou&s;and Men, with one Troop of Hor&s;e more, which the Planters of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> joyn'd to him; and having a pro&s;perous wind, they came, about the middle of <HI>April,</HI> within view of <HI>Santo Domingo;</HI> which is the chief City and Port <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Hi|&s;paniola:</NOTE> of the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR Orders from <HI>Cromwell</HI> were very particular, and very po&s;i|tive, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Orders.</NOTE> that they &s;hould land at &s;uch a place, which was plainly enough de&s;cribed to them. But whether they did not clearly under&s;tand it, or <MILESTONE N="20"> thought it not &s;o convenient, when they were near enough to make a judgement of it, they called a Council of War; and it was there re&s;olv'd that General <HI>Venables</HI> &s;hould land in another place (which they con|ceiv'd to be much nearer the Town than in truth it was) and from thence march directly to it, there being another Brigade of Foot to be landed, at a le&s;s di&s;tance from the Town, in a Bay, that &s;hould joyn with them; and joyn they did. But by the march which <HI>Venables</HI> had made, in which he &s;pent two days and a half in the woods and unea&s;y Pa&s;&s;ages, and in the terrible heat of that country's Sun, where they found no Water to drink, they were &s;o di&s;pirited before they joyn'd <MILESTONE N="30"> with their Companions, that it was an ill pre&s;age of the mi&s;adventure that follow'd. The lo&s;s of that time in their Advance had another very ill effect. For the Inhabitants of the Town, that, at the fir&s;t appearance of &s;uch a Fleet, the like whereof in any degree they had never &s;een before, had been &s;ei&s;ed upon by &s;uch a con&s;ternation, that they de&s;pair'd of making any re&s;i&s;tance, when they &s;aw their Enemies proceed &s;o &s;low|ly, and engaged in &s;uch a march as mu&s;t tire and infinitely annoy them, they recover'd their Spirits, and prepared for their Defence. So that when <HI>Venables,</HI> upon the conjunction with his other Forces, and after having found &s;ome fre&s;h Water to refre&s;h his Men, advanced towards <MILESTONE N="40"> the Town, his forlorne hope found them&s;elves charged by a Party of Hor&s;e armed with long Lances, and other Armes, which they had not been accu&s;tom'd to; &s;o, tired and di&s;maied with their march and heat, they bore the Charge very ill, and were ea&s;ily routed, and routed tho&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">Venables <HI>beaten by a few</HI> Spaniards.</NOTE> which were behind them; and were, in that di&s;order, pur&s;ued till they came to their main Body; upon &s;ight whereof the <HI>Spaniard</HI> retired without any lo&s;s, having left the Captain of the forlorne hope, and above fifty of his Company, dead upon the place. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> retired back in great di&s;comfort to the Bay, and the fre&s;h Water River they had &s;ound there; where they &s;tayed &s;o long, that the General thought his <MILESTONE N="50"> Men not only enough refre&s;h'd, but enough confirm'd in their re&s;olu|tions to redeem the &s;hame of their la&s;t di&s;order, having got Guides, who undertook to conduct them a nearer way to the City, and that they &s;hould not go near a Fort, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had in a wood, from
<PB N="454" REF="4660">
whence they had been infe&s;ted. The Common opinion that the <HI>Ne|groes,</HI> Natives of tho&s;e parts, are &s;uch Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they are willing to betray them, and do any mi&s;chief to them, might po&s;&s;ibly incline the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to give credit to tho&s;e Guides. But they did conduct them directly to the Fort; near which an Ambu&s;cade in the woods di&s;charged a volly again upon the forlorne hope, and fell then in upon them with &s;uch fury, that di&s;order'd the whole Army; which, though it recover'd the courage once more to make an Attempt upon that Fort, was again &s;ei&s;ed upon by a panick fear, which made them directly fly back to the Bay with the lo&s;s of above &s;ix hundred Men, <MILESTONE N="50"> whereof their Major General was one.</P>
<P>THIS fright they never recover'd; but, within few days after, having undergone many di&s;tre&s;&s;es by the intolerable heat of the Climate, and the <HI>Negroes</HI> killing their Men every day, as they went into the Woods to find meat, they were, within five or &s;ix days after the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> compell'd to reimbark them&s;elves on board the Fleet, with a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He reimbarks, and makes a De&s;cent upon</HI> Jamaica; <HI>where he &s;uc|ceeds.</HI></NOTE> thou&s;and Men le&s;s than had been landed, who had by &s;everal ways lo&s;t their lives there; for which they revenged them&s;elves upon a neigh|bour I&s;land, call'd <HI>Jamaica;</HI> where they made another de&s;cent, took their City, and drove all the Inhabitants into the Woods. And here <MILESTONE N="20"> they left a good Body of Foot con&s;i&s;ting of three or four thou&s;and Men, under the command of a Colonel, to fortify and plant in this I&s;land, a place fruitful in it &s;elf, and abounding in many good provi&s;ions, and a perpetual &s;harp thorn in the &s;ides of the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> who receiv'd exceed|ing damage from thence; they who were &s;o ea&s;ily frighted, and beaten, when they were in a great Body upon the other I&s;land, making after|wards frequent incur&s;ions, with &s;mall Numbers, into it from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &s;acking their Towns, and returning with very rich booty. When <HI>Ve|nables</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That Fleet returns into</HI> England.</NOTE> had put this I&s;land into as good order as he could, he return'd with <HI>Pen</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE other Fleet under the Command of <HI>Blake</HI> had better &s;ucce&s;s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet un|der</HI> Blake <HI>had better &s;ucce&s;s: forces</HI> Algiers <HI>to a Peace; enters the Harbour of</HI> Tunis, <HI>and burns their Fleet</HI></NOTE> without any mi&s;adventures. After he had reduced tho&s;e of <HI>Algiers,</HI> where he anchored in their very Mole, to &s;ubmit to &s;uch conditions for the time pa&s;t, and the time to come, as he thought rea&s;onable, he &s;ailed to <HI>Tunis;</HI> which he found better fortified and more re&s;olv'd; for that King return'd a very rude An&s;wer, contemning his &s;trength, and undervaluing his Menaces, and refu&s;ing to return either Ship or Pri|&s;oner that had been taken. Whereupon <HI>Blake</HI> put his Fleet in order, and thunder'd with his great Guns upon the Town; whil&s;t he &s;ent out &s;everal long Boats manned with &s;tout Mariners, who, at the &s;ame time, <MILESTONE N="40"> enter'd with very notable re&s;olution into their Harbours, and &s;et fire to all the Ships there, being nine Men of War; which were burnt to a&s;hes; and this with the lo&s;s only of five and twenty of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and about eight and forty hurt, all the boats, with the re&s;t of the Men, re|turning &s;afe to the Ships. This was indeed an Action of the highe&s;t conduct and courage, and made the name of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very terrible and formidable in tho&s;e Seas.</P>
<P>THE Succe&s;s of both Fleets came to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s notice about the &s;ame time, but did not affect him alike. He was never &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed (for he had u&s;ually a great command over his Pa&s;&s;ions) as upon the mi&s;|carriage <MILESTONE N="50"> at <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> And a&s;&s;oon as they came on &s;hore, he committed <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Span$.</NOTE> both <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables</HI> to the Tower, and could never be per&s;waded to tru&s;t either of them again; and could not, in a long time, &s;peak tempe|rately

of that Affair. However, he lo&s;t no time in cheri&s;hing his in|fant Plantation in <HI>Jamaica;</HI> which many thought to be at too great a di&s;tance, and wi&s;h'd the Men might be recalled; but he would not hear of it; and &s;ent pre&s;ently a good Squadron of Ships, and a Recruit <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S$nds recruits to</HI> Jamaica.</NOTE> of fifteen hundred Men to carry on that work; and re&s;olv'd nothing more, than to make a continual War from that place upon the <HI>Spa|niard.</HI></P>
<P><Q>AND now the rupture with <HI>Spain</HI> could be no longer concealed.

<P>FLANDERS had notice of this their new Enemy from <HI>England,</HI> be|fore they heard any thing from <HI>Spain,</HI> that might better enable them to contend with him; and <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> remain'd &s;till in <HI>London</HI> without notice of what was done, till the Affair of <HI>Jamaica</HI> was upon the Ex|change, and Fraternities enter'd into there for the better carrying on that Plantation.

The Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> who&s;e Troops, and vigour, were the pre&s;ervation and life of that Country, was very ill &s;atisfied with the formality and &s;legm of the Arch-Duke, and with the unactivity and wa|rine&s;s of the <HI>Conte</HI> of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna;</HI> who he thought omitted many Opportunities.</P>
<P>THE Arch-Duke was weary of the Title of Governour of the Low Countries and General of the Army, when the Power was in truth in <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna,</HI> and nothing to be done without His approbation; and <MILESTONE N="40"> having by frequent complaints to <HI>Madrid,</HI> endeavour'd in vain to vin|dicate his authority, had implored his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna</HI> him|&s;elf was as ill &s;atisfied as the other two; and knowing well the defects of the Court, as well as the poverty of <HI>Madrid,</HI> thought the defence of <HI>Flanders</HI> con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t in pre&s;erving the Army, by being on the defen&s;ive part; and therefore, to gratify the coldne&s;s of his own con&s;ti|tution, he did by no means approve the frequent Enterpri&s;es and re&s;tle&s;s Spirit of the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;;</HI> which &s;pent their Men: and he thought the great charge in &s;upporting the &s;tate and dignity of the Arch-Duke, was not recompenced by any benefit from his Service, be&s;ides the irre|concilablene&s;s <MILESTONE N="50"> with the Arch-Duke, by his having compelled him, by the authority of the King, to di&s;mi&s;s the Count of <HI>Swa&s;&s;enburgh;</HI> whom he lov'd of all the world; &s;o that he was likewi&s;e weary of his Po&s;t, and de&s;ired his deliverance to be &s;ent him from <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>

THE Council there thought it nece&s;&s;ary to gratify them both, and to remove both the Arch-Duke and the <HI>Conde;</HI> honourably to di&s;mi&s;s the former to return to his own re&s;idence in <HI>Germany,</HI> and to bring <NOTE PLACE="marg">Don Juan <HI>of</HI> Au&s;tria <HI>made Governour of</HI> Flanders; <HI>and</HI> Carracena <HI>ap|pointed to com|mand the Ar|my under him.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the natural Son of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had pa&s;&s;ed through many employments with reputation, and was at that time General in <HI>Italy,</HI> to undertake the Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> $$th &s;uch re&s;trictions as the King of <HI>Spain</HI> thought fit; and at the &s;ame time, that the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna</HI> &s;hould immediately enter upon the Go|vernment of <HI>Milan;</HI> which had been exerci&s;ed for the la&s;t &s;ix years by the Marquis of <HI>Carracena;</HI> who was now to govern the Army in <HI>Flan|ders</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> under <HI>Don Juan;</HI> and that the Marquis, who had the mo&s;t di&s;ad|vantage of this promotion, might be better plea&s;ed, they gave him &s;uch an addition of authority, as could not but breed ill blood in <HI>Don Juan;</HI> as it fell out afterwards. This coun&s;el was taken, and to be executed in this conjuncture, when <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> were ready to enter <HI>Flanders</HI> with two powerful Armies, whil&s;t it was, upon the matter, under no Command.</P>
<P>THE King was yet at <HI>Cologne;</HI> and no &s;ooner heard of the War that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had begun upon <HI>Spain,</HI> but he concluded that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would not be unwilling to enter into &s;ome corre&s;pondence with him; <MILESTONE N="20"> at lea&s;t, that their fears were over of offending <HI>Cromwell.</HI> He there|fore <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King had &s;ent to the Arch-Duke to offer his con|junction before the Arch-Duke left</HI> Flanders.</NOTE> &s;ent privately to the Arch-Duke, and to <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna,</HI> to offer them his Conjunction. <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> was likewi&s;e there; and the long Experience he had in <HI>England,</HI> and the Quality he &s;till held, made his judgement in tho&s;e Affairs mo&s;t e&s;teem'd by them. He, whether upon the Con&s;cience of his former behaviour, by which he had di&s;obliged both the late and the pre&s;ent King, or whether by having liv'd long in a place where the King's intere&s;t was contemned, he did in truth be|lieve that his Maje&s;ty could bring little advantage to them, had no mind to make a conjunction with him: yet they &s;aw one benefit which they <MILESTONE N="30"> might receive, if his Maje&s;ty would draw off the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> from the Service of <HI>France;</HI> which they had rea&s;on to believe would be in his power, becau&s;e he had formerly drawn off &s;ome Regiments from <HI>Spain,</HI> whil&s;t he remain'd in <HI>France.</HI> So that they were all of opinion, that they would confer with any body the King &s;hould authorize to treat with them; which when the King knew, he re&s;olv'd to go to them Him&s;elf; and left <HI>Cologne,</HI> attended only by two or three Servants; and when he came near <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> &s;ent to adverti&s;e the Arch-Duke at what di&s;tance <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King came into</HI> Flanders, <HI>and treats with the Arch-Duke near</HI> Bru&s;&s;els.</NOTE> he was; <Q>and &startq;that he would &s;ee him <HI>incognito</HI> in what place, or man|ner,&endq; he &s;hould think fit.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THEY either were, or &s;eem'd to be much troubled that the King was come in Per&s;on; and de&s;ired, that he would by no means come to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI> but that he would remain in a little vile Dorp about a league from <HI>Bru&s;sels;</HI> where he was very meanly accommodated. Thither the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna</HI> and <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> came to his Maje&s;ty; and the Arch-Duke met him privately at another place. The King quickly di&s;cover'd that <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> had a private Intrigue with &s;ome Officers of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, who were Enemies to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> upon who&s;e In|tere&s;t he more depended than the King's, and offer'd it as great merit to his Maje&s;ty, if he could be able to per&s;wade them to make up a conjun|ction <MILESTONE N="40"> with the King. This corre&s;pondence between <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> and tho&s;e Levellers, was managed by an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Je&s;uit, who, by &s;peaking <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> had got him&s;elf to be mutually tru&s;ted by them. The King

pre&s;&s;ed them <Q>&startq;that he might remove his Family to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> or to &s;ome place in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that it might be notorious that he was in Alliance with his Catholick Maje&s;ty; and then they &s;hould quickly &s;ee he had another kind of Intere&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> than what tho&s;e Men pretended to, upon whom they ought not to depend; and they would quickly find, if his Maje&s;ty re&s;ided in that Country, his influence upon the&endq; <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> who were in <HI>France.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THEY would by no means con&s;ent that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould remain in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> as little at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> or indeed in any place, as taken notice <MILESTONE N="10"> of by the State to be there; <Q>&startq;which, they &s;aid, the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s honour would not permit, without &s;hewing tho&s;e re&s;pects to him that he might live in that Grandeur as became a Great King; which the pre&s;ent &s;tate of their affairs would not permit them to defray the charge&endq; of.</Q> <Q>But they intimated, &startq;that if his Maje&s;ty would choo&s;e to re|move his family to <HI>Bruges,</HI> and remain there with them, &s;o far <HI>in|cognito,</HI> as not to expect any publick expen&s;ive Reception, they were&endq; &s;ure he would find all re&s;pect from the Inhabitants of that City.</Q> The King de&s;ired that &s;ome Treaty might be &s;igned between them; which was committed to the wi&s;dom of <HI>Don Alonzo;</HI> who prepared it in as <MILESTONE N="20"> perfunctory a manner as was po&s;&s;ible; by which the King was permitted to re&s;ide in <HI>Bruges,</HI> <Q>and nothing on the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s part undertaken but &startq;that whenever the King could cau&s;e a good Port-Town in <HI>England</HI> to declare for him, his Catholick Maje&s;ty would a&s;&s;i&s;t him with a Body of &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and with &s;uch a proportion of Ammunition,&endq; and &s;o many Ships to tran&s;port that Body thither;</Q> which was the propo&s;ition the Levellers had made; and <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> by making it the contract with the King, thought this way to beget an Intelligence between them and the Royal Party; of the power of which he had no e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THE King di&s;cern'd that what they offer'd would be of no moment, <MILESTONE N="30"> nor could he make &s;uch confident Propo&s;itions of advantage to <HI>Spain,</HI> as might warrant him to in&s;i&s;t upon large conce&s;&s;ions. Be&s;ides, it was evident to him, that the affairs in tho&s;e Provinces, which remain'd un|der <HI>Spain,</HI> were in &s;o evil a po&s;ture, that, if they &s;hould promi&s;e any great matters, they would not be able to perform them. However, all that he de&s;ired, was to have the reputation of a Treaty between Him and the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> under which he might draw his family from <HI>Cologne,</HI> and remain in <HI>Flanders,</HI> which was at a ju&s;t di&s;tance from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to expect other Alterations. So his Maje&s;ty readily accepted the <MILESTONE N="40"> Treaty as it was drawn by <HI>Don Alonzo;</HI> and &s;ign'd it; and declared that he would re&s;ide in the manner they propo&s;ed at <HI>Bruges.</HI> Where|upon, after &s;even or eight days &s;tay in that inconvenient manner, the Treaty was engro&s;&s;ed and &s;igned by the King, the Arch-Duke, and <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> or the end of <HI>March</HI> 1657; the di&s;patch of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Treaty &s;igned</HI> April 165$&punc; <HI>between</HI> Spain <HI>and the King.</HI></NOTE> Treaty being ha&s;tened by the nece&s;&s;ity of the departure of the Arch-Duke, and the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna;</HI> who begun their Journey within two or three days after the &s;igning of it; <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> being known to be on their way; and both, though not to|gether, within few days Journey of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>THE Treaty, as it was &s;ign'd, was &s;ent by an Expre&s;s into <HI>Spain,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King $Span$ from</HI> $Word$, <HI>and $Span$ at</HI> $Word$.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> for the approbation and &s;ignature of his Catholick Maje&s;ty. The King with his &s;mall train went to <HI>Bruges,</HI> and lodged in the Hou&s;e of a Sub|ject of his own, the Lord <HI>Tarah,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h-</HI>man; who had been born in
<PB N="458" REF="4700">
that Country, and inherited an e&s;tate by his Mother. There the King &s;tayed, till a hand&s;ome Accommodation was provided for him in that City, having &s;ent to his Brother the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> who remain'd yet at <HI>Cologne,</HI> to come to him, and that his Family &s;hould all come from thence. So that by the time his Maje&s;ty had return'd again to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> to congratulate <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s arrival, and &s;pent three or four days there, he found him&s;elf as well &s;ettled at <HI>Bruges</HI> as he had been at <HI>Cologne;</HI> where, when his Family left it, there was not the lea&s;t debt remain'd un&s;atisfied; which, in the low condition his Maje&s;ty had been in, and &s;till was, gave reputation to his Oeconomy. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>As upon the di&s;&s;olution of the unruly Parliament, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;ent out his two great Fleets, to propagate his fame abroad, pre&s;uming that by the Conque&s;t which the one would make in the We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> he &s;hould have Money enough to keep his Army in obedience to him, and by the other's de&s;troying or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Turks of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and <HI>Tu|nis,</HI> which were indeed grown formidable to all Merchants, he &s;hould rai&s;e his reputation in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and become very popular with all the Merchants of <HI>England;</HI> &s;o he did not, in the mean time, neglect to take all the ways he could devi&s;e, to provide for his own &s;ecurity at home. Though he had brought the King's Party &s;o low, that he had <MILESTONE N="20"> no apprehen&s;ion of their power to rai&s;e an Army again&s;t him; yet he di&s;cerned, that by breaking their Fortunes and E&s;tates, he had not at all broken their Spirits; and that by taking &s;o many of their lives, their numbers were not much le&s;&s;en'd; and that they would be &s;till ready to throw them&s;elves into any Party that &s;hould declare again&s;t him; to which, he knew, there were enough inclined.</P>
<P>BUT that which troubled him mo&s;t, was the di&s;temper in his Army; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>di&s;turbed with the divi&s;ions in his own Ar|my</HI></NOTE> where he knew there were many Troops more at the di&s;po&s;al of that Party that would de&s;troy him, than at his own. It was once in his pur|po&s;e to have drawn over a Regiment of <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> upon pretence of &s;end|ing <MILESTONE N="30"> them into <HI>Ireland,</HI> but in truth with intention to keep them as a Guard to his own Per&s;on; and to that purpo&s;e he had &s;ent a Per&s;on to treat with Colonel <HI>Balthazer,</HI> a Man well known in the Prote&s;tant <HI>Can|tons;</HI> but this came to be di&s;cover'd: &s;o he had not confidence to pro|ceed in it. He re&s;olv'd therefore upon an Expedient, which &s;hould pro|vide for all inconveniencies, as well among&s;t the People, as in the Ar|my. He con&s;tituted, out of the Per&s;ons who he thought were mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;titutes his Major Gene|rals.</NOTE> devoted to him&s;elf, a Body of Major Generals; that is, he a&s;&s;ign'd to &s;uch a &s;ingle Per&s;on &s;o many Counties, to be under his Command as their Major General: &s;o that all <HI>England</HI> was put under the ab&s;olute <MILESTONE N="40"> power of twelve Men, neither of them having any power in the juri&s;|diction of another, but every Man, in tho&s;e Counties which were com|mitted to his Charge, had all that authority which was before divided among Committee-Men, Ju&s;tices of Peace, and &s;everal other Officers.</P>
<P>THE Major General committed to Pri&s;on what Per&s;ons he thought <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Power.</NOTE> &s;it to &s;u&s;pect; took care to levy all Monies which were appointed by the Protector and his Council to be collected for the Publick; &s;eque|&s;ter'd all who did not pay their decimation, or &s;uch other payments as they were made liable to; and there was no Appeal from any of their Acts but to the Protector him&s;elf. They had likewi&s;e a Martial power, <MILESTONE N="50"> which was to li&s;t a Body of Hor&s;e and Foot, who were to have &s;uch a Salary con&s;tantly paid, and not to be called upon to &s;erve but upon emergent occa&s;ion, and then to attend &s;o many days at their own Charge;
<PB N="459" REF="4710">
and if they &s;tayed longer, they were to be under the &s;ame pay with the Army, but independent upon the Officers thereof, and only to obey their Major General. A Hor&s;e-man had eight pounds a year; for which he was to be ready with his Hor&s;e if he were called upon; if he were not, he might intend his own Affairs. By this means he had a &s;econd Army in view, powerful enough to controle the fir&s;t, if they at any time de&s;erv'd to be &s;u&s;pected. But he di&s;cern'd, by degrees, that the&s;e new Magi&s;trates grew too much in love with their own power; and be|&s;ides that they carried them&s;elves like &s;o many <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s with their Bands <MILESTONE N="10"> of <HI>Janizaries,</HI> towards the People, and were extremely odious to all parties, they did really affect &s;uch an authority as might undermine his own greatne&s;s; yet, for the pre&s;ent, he thought not fit to controle them, and &s;eem'd le&s;s to apprehend them.</P>
<P>WHEN Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> had &s;ubdued the <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Algiers,</HI> and betaken him&s;elf to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> and by the attempt of <HI>Hi|&s;paniola</HI> and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the War was &s;ufficiently declar'd again&s;t the Catholick King, <HI>Mountague,</HI> a young Gentleman of a good <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountague <HI>&s;ent to joyn with</HI> Blake, <HI>and put in Commi&s;&s;ion with him.</HI></NOTE> Family, who had been drawn into the Party of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and &s;erv'd under him as a Colonel in his Army with much Courage, was &s;ent with <MILESTONE N="20"> an Addition of Ships to joyn with <HI>Blake,</HI> and joyn'd in Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiral and General with him; <HI>Blake</HI> having found him&s;elf much in|di&s;po&s;ed in his health, and having de&s;ired that another might be &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and to take care of the Fleet, if wor&s;e &s;hould befal him.

<P>THE Ships which were &s;ent for <HI>England,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> and though they might with le&s;s charge have continued their Voyage by Sea to <HI>London, Cromwell</HI> thought it would make more noi&s;e, if all the Bul|lion, which was of great value, was landed at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> from whence <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Bull$$ taken conver'd from</HI> Port&s;mouth <HI>to</HI> London</NOTE> it was brought by Land in many Carts to <HI>London,</HI> and carried through the City to the Tower to be there coin'd, as it was, within as &s;hort a <MILESTONE N="50"> time as it could be di&s;patch'd; and though it was in it &s;elf very con&s;i|derable, they gave out and reported it to be of much greater value than it was.

&s;aw the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet &s;till remaining before them, which was not like to mi&s;s the other Fleet they &s;hortly after expected, in &s;pight of all Ad|verti&s;ements which they were like to be able to &s;end to it.</P>
<P>CROMWELL now thought his reputation, both abroad and at home, &s;o good, that he might venture again upon calling of a Parliament; and, by their countenance and concurrence, &s;uppre&s;s, or compo&s;e tho&s;e refractory Spirits, which cro&s;&s;ed him in all places; and having fir&s;t made &s;uch Sheriffs in all Counties as he thought would be like to con|tribute to his de&s;igns, by hindering &s;uch Men to &s;tand again&s;t whom he had a prejudice, at lea&s;t, by not returning them if they &s;hould be cho&s;en, <MILESTONE N="10"> and by procuring &s;uch Per&s;ons to be returned as would be mo&s;t agree|able to him, of which there were choice in all Counties; and having prepared all things to this purpo&s;e, as well as he could, he &s;ent out his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gromwell <HI>&s;ummons a Parliament to meet,</HI> Sept. 17. 1656.</NOTE> Writs to call a Parliament to meet at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> upon the &s;even|teenth of <HI>September,</HI> in the year 1656. When, upon the Returns, he found, that though in &s;ome places he had &s;ucceeded according to his wi&s;h, it was in others quite the contrary, and that very many Mem|bers were return'd, who were Men of the mo&s;t notorious malignity again&s;t him, he therefore re&s;orted to his old &s;ecurity, to keep all man|ner <NOTE PLACE="marg">Impo&s;es a Sub|&s;cription upon the Members before they &s;ate.</NOTE> of Per&s;ons from entering into the Hou&s;e, <Q>who did not fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe, <MILESTONE N="20"> &startq;that they would act nothing prejudicial to the Government as it was&endq; e&s;tabli&s;h'd under a Protector;</Q> which being tender'd, many Members utterly refu&s;ed, and return'd into their Countries, where they were not, for the mo&s;t part, the wor&s;e welcome for in&s;i&s;ting upon their Privileges, and freedom of Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Major part frankly &s;ubmitted and &s;ub&s;cribed; &s;ome of them, that they might have the better opportunity to do mi&s;chief. So a Speaker was cho&s;en; and at fir&s;t they proceeded &s;o unanimou&s;ly, that the Pro|tector begun to hope that he had gain'd his point. With very little, or no contradiction, they pa&s;&s;ed an Act of Renunciation of any title <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proceed|ings of this Parliament.</NOTE> that <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> (for &s;o they had long called the King) or any of that Family might pretend; and this all Men were bound to &s;ub&s;cribe. With as little oppo&s;ition, they pa&s;&s;ed another, whereby it was made High Trea&s;on to attempt any thing again&s;t the life of the Protector. Then they pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal Acts for rai&s;ing Money by way of contribution in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> in a greater proportion than had ever yet been rai&s;ed. They granted Tonnage and Poundage to the Pro|tector for his life; and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal other Acts for the rai&s;ing of Mo|nies; among&s;t them, one for obliging all Per&s;ons to pay a full year's Rent for all buildings which had been erected in, and about <HI>London,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> from before the beginning of the Troubles; by all which ways, va&s;t Sums of Money were to be, and afterwards were, rai&s;ed. All the&s;e Acts they pre&s;ented &s;olemnly to his Highne&s;s, to be confirm'd by his Royal Authority; <Q>and He as graciou&s;ly confirm'd them all; and told them, &startq;that as it had been the cu&s;tom of the chief Governours to acknowledge the care and kindne&s;s of the Commons upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, &s;o He&endq; did very heartily and thankfully acknowledge Theirs.</Q></P>
<P>BUT after all this, he was far from being &s;atisfied with the method of their proceeding; for there was nothing done to confirm his Per&s;onal Authority; and notwith&s;tanding all this was done, they might, for <MILESTONE N="50"> ought appear'd, remove him from being both Protector, and General. There had been for &s;ome time jealou&s;ies between Him and <HI>Lambert,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell&punc; <HI>$Span$ of</HI> Lambert</NOTE> who had been the principal advi&s;er of the rai&s;ing tho&s;e Major Ge|nerals;
<PB N="461" REF="4730">
and being one of them him&s;elf, and having the Government of the five Northern Counties committed to him, he de&s;ired to improve their Authority, and to have it &s;ettled by Authority of Parliament. But <HI>Cromwell,</HI> on the other hand, was well contented that they &s;hould be look'd upon as a publick grievance, and &s;o taken away, rather upon the de&s;ire of Parliament, than that it &s;hould appear to be out of his own inclination. But, hitherto, neither that de&s;ign in <HI>Lambert,</HI> nor the other in <HI>Cromwell,</HI> nor any difference between them, had broken out.</P>
<P>THE Protector him&s;elf &s;eem'd to de&s;ire nothing more, than to have <MILESTONE N="10"> the Authority they had formerly given him, at lea&s;t, that he had exer|ci&s;ed from the time he was Protector, confirm'd, and ratified by Act of Parliament. And if it had been &s;o, it had been much greater than any King ever enjoyed. <Q>But he had u&s;ed to &s;peak much, &startq;that it was pity the Nobility &s;hould be totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and that the Government would be better, if it pa&s;&s;ed another con&s;ultation be&s;ides that of the Hou&s;e of Commons. In matter of Religion, he would often &s;peak, that there was much of good in the order of Bi&s;hops, if the dro&s;s were&endq; &s;cour'd off.</Q> He courted very much many of the Nobility, and u&s;ed all devices to di&s;po&s;e them to come to him; and they who did vi&s;it him <MILESTONE N="20"> were u&s;ed with extraordinary re&s;pect by him; all which, rai&s;ed an opi|nion in many, that he did in truth him&s;elf affect to be King; which was the more confirm'd, when many of tho&s;e who had neare&s;t Relation to him, and were mo&s;t tru&s;ted by him, a&s;&s;oon as the Parliament had di&s;|patch'd tho&s;e Acts, which are mention'd before, and that complaints came from all parts again&s;t the Major Generals, inveigh'd &s;harply again&s;t the temper and compo&s;ition of the Government, as if it was not ca|pable to &s;ettle the &s;everal di&s;tractions, and &s;atisfy the &s;everal Intere&s;ts of the Nation; <Q>and by degrees propo&s;ed, in direct terms, &startq;that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Propo&s;ition in the Parlia|ment for</HI> Cromwell <HI>to be King.</HI></NOTE> might inve&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI> with the Title, Rights, and Dignity of a King; <MILESTONE N="30"> and then he would know, what he was to do towards the &s;atisfaction&endq; of all Parties, and how to govern tho&s;e who would not be &s;atisfied.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Propo&s;ition found a great concurrence; and very many who u&s;ed not to agree in any thing el&s;e, were of one mind in This, and would pre&s;ently vote him King. And it was ob&s;erv'd that no body was for|warder in that Acclamation, than &s;ome Men who had allways had the reputation of great fidelity to the King, and to wi&s;h his Re&s;toration: and it cannot be denied that very many of the King's Party were &s;o de|ceiv'd in their judgements, as really to believe, that the making <HI>Crom|well</HI> King for the pre&s;ent, was the be&s;t Expedient for the Re&s;toration <MILESTONE N="40"> of his Maje&s;ty; and that the Army, and the whole Nation, would then have been united rather to re&s;tore the true, than to admit of a fal&s;e So|veraign, who&s;e Hypocri&s;y and Tyranny being now detected, and known, would be the more dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>BUT the more &s;ober Per&s;ons of the King's Party, who made le&s;s noi&s;e, trembled at this Overture; and believ'd that it was the only way, utterly to de&s;troy the King, and to pull up all future hopes of the Royal Family by the Roots. They &s;aw all Men even already tired in their hopes; and that which was left of Spirit in them, was from the horror they had of the confu&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Government; that very <MILESTONE N="50"> many, who had &s;u&s;tain'd the King's Quarrel in the beginning, were dead; that the pre&s;ent King, by his long ab&s;ence out of the Kingdom, was known to very few; &s;o that there was too much rea&s;on to fear, that much of that Affection that appear'd under the notion of Allegiance
<PB N="462" REF="4740">
to the King, was more directed to the Monarchy than to the Per&s;on; and that if <HI>Cromwell</HI> were once made King, and &s;o the Government run again in the old Channel, though tho&s;e who were in love with a Re|publick would po&s;&s;ibly fall from him, he would receive abundant re|paration of &s;trength by the Acce&s;s of tho&s;e who preferr'd the Monar|chy, and which probably would reconcile mo&s;t Men of E&s;tates to an ab|&s;olute acquie&s;cence, if not to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; that the Nobility, which being excluded to a Man, and depriv'd of all the Rights and Pri|vileges due to them by their Birth-right, and &s;o Enemies irreconcilable to the pre&s;ent Government, would, by this alteration, find them&s;elves <MILESTONE N="10"> in their right places, and be glad to adhere to the Name of a King, how unlawful a one &s;oever; and there was an Act of Parliament &s;till in force, that was made in the eleventh year of King <HI>Harry</HI> the &s;eventh, which &s;eem'd to provide ab&s;olute Indemnity to &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. And there was, without doubt, at that time, too much propen&s;ion in too many of the Nobility, to ran&s;ome them&s;elves at the charge of their Lawful Soveraign. And therefore they who made the&s;e prudent recollections, u&s;ed all the ways they could to prevent this de&s;ign, and to divert any &s;uch Vote in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, <HI>Lambert,</HI> who was the &s;econd Man of power in <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>and his Party op|po&s;e this Over|ture:</HI></NOTE> the Army, and many other Officers of account and intere&s;t, be&s;ides the Country Members, oppo&s;ed this Overture with great bitterne&s;s, and indignation: <Q>&s;ome of them &s;aid directly, &startq;that if, contrary to their Oaths and Engagements, and contrary to the end, for obtaining where|of they had &s;pent &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure, they mu&s;t at la&s;t re|turn and &s;ubmit to the old Government, and live again under a King, they would choo&s;e much rather to obey the true and lawful Heir to the Crown, who was de&s;cended from a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Kings who had managed the Scepter over the Nation, than to &s;ubmit to a Per&s;on who at be&s;t was but their equal, and rai&s;ed by them&s;elves from the <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ame degree of which they all were, and by the tru&s;t they had repo&s;ed&endq; in him, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf above them.</Q> That which put an end to the pre&s;ent Debate was (and which was as wonderful as any thing) that &s;ome of his own Family, who had grown up under him, and had their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And &s;ome of</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s own Relations.</HI></NOTE> whole dependence upon him, as <HI>Desborough, Fleetwood, Whaley,</HI> and others, as pa&s;&s;ionately contradicted the motion, as any of the other Of|ficers; <Q>and confidently undertook to know, &startq;that him&s;elf would never con&s;ent to it; and therefore that it was very &s;trange that any Men &s;hould importune the putting &s;uch a Que&s;tion, before they knew that&endq; he would accept it,</Q> unle&s;s they took this way to de&s;troy him. Upon <MILESTONE N="40"> this (for which the Undertakers receiv'd no thanks) the fir&s;t Debate was put off, till farther con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THE Debate was re&s;umed again the next day, with the &s;ame warmth, the &s;ame Per&s;ons &s;till of the &s;ame opinion they had been before: mo&s;t of the Officers of the Army, as well as they who were the great Depen|dents upon, and Creatures of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as pa&s;&s;ionately oppo&s;ed the making him King, as <HI>Lambert</HI> and the re&s;t did, who look'd to be &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Protectors after his decea&s;e; only it was ob&s;erv'd, that they who the day before had undertaken, that he him&s;elf would never endure it (which had e&s;pecially made the pau&s;e at that time) urged that Argument <MILESTONE N="50"> no more; but inveigh'd &s;till again&s;t it as a Mon&s;trous thing, and that which would infallibly ruin him. But mo&s;t of tho&s;e of his Privy Coun|cil, and others neare&s;t his tru&s;t, were as violent and as po&s;itive for the

declaring him King, and much the Major part of the Hou&s;e concurr'd in the &s;ame opinion; and notwith&s;tanding all was &s;aid to the contrary, they appointed a Committee of &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent Members <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Committee appointed to confer with</HI> Cromwell <HI>about it.</HI></NOTE> of the Hou&s;e to wait upon him, <Q>and to inform him of &startq;the very ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire of the Hou&s;e, that he would take upon him the Title of King; and if they &s;hould find any aver&s;ion in him, that they &s;hould then enlarge in giving him tho&s;e rea&s;ons, which had been offer'd in the Hou&s;e, and which had &s;wayed the Hou&s;e to that re&s;olution, which&endq; they hoped would have the &s;ame Influence upon his Highne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>HE gave them Audience in the painted Chamber, when they made <NOTE PLACE="marg">He gives them Audience, and they offer him their rea|&s;ons.</NOTE> the bare Overture to him, as the de&s;ire of his Parliament; at which he <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;eem'd &s;urpri&s;ed; <Q>and told them, &startq;he wonder'd how any &s;uch thing came into their minds; that it was neither fit for Them to offer, nor Him to receive; that he was &s;ure they could di&s;cover no &s;uch Am|bition in him, and that his Con&s;cience would not give him leave ever&endq; to con&s;ent to own that Title.</Q> <Q>They, who were well prepared to ex|pect &s;uch an An&s;wer, told him, &startq;that they hoped, he would not &s;o &s;ud|dainly give a po&s;itive denial to what the Parliament had de&s;ired upon &s;o long, and mature deliberation; that They, who knew his mode&s;ty <MILESTONE N="20"> well, and that he more affected to de&s;erve the highe&s;t Titles than to wear them, were appointed to offer many rea&s;ons, which had induced the Hou&s;e to make this reque&s;t to him; which when he had vouch|&s;afed to hear, they hoped the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion would be made upon&endq; Him, that had been made upon Them in the Hou&s;e.</Q> He was too de|&s;irous to give the Parliament all the Satisfaction he could with a good Con&s;cience, to refu&s;e to hear whatever they thought fit to &s;ay to him; and &s;o appointed them another day to attend him in the &s;ame place; which they accordingly did.</P>
<P><Q>WHEN they came to him again, they all &s;ucce&s;&s;ively entertain'd <MILESTONE N="30"> him with long Harangues, &s;etting out &startq;the nature of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People, and the nature of the Government to which they had been accu&s;tom'd, and under which they had flouri&s;hed from the time they had been a People: that though the extreme &s;ufferings they had undergone by corrupt Mini&s;ters, under negligent, and tyrannical Kings, had tran&s;|ported them to throw off the Government it &s;elf, as well as to inflict Ju&s;tice upon the Per&s;ons of the Offenders; yet they found by expe|rience, that no other Government would &s;o well fit the Nation, as that to which it had been accu&s;tom'd: that, notwith&s;tanding the infi|nite pains his Highne&s;s had taken, and which had been crowned, even <MILESTONE N="40"> with miraculous &s;ucce&s;s, by the immediate ble&s;&s;ing of Divine Provi|dence upon all his Actions and all his Coun&s;els, there remained &s;till a re&s;t|le&s;s and unquiet Spirit in Men, that threaten'd the publick Peace; and that it was mo&s;t apparent, by the dayly Combinations and Con&s;piracies again&s;t the pre&s;ent Government, how ju&s;t and gentle and mild &s;oever, that the heart of the Nation was devoted to the old form, with which it was acquainted; and that it was the love of that, not the Affection to the young Man who pretended a title to it, and was known to no body, which di&s;po&s;ed &s;o many to wi&s;h for the return of it: that the Name and Title of a Protector was never known to this Kingdom, but <MILESTONE N="50"> in the hands of a Subject, during the Reign of an infant Soveraign; and therefore, that the Laws gave little re&s;pect to him, but were all|ways executed in the Name of the King, how young &s;oever, and how unfit &s;oever to govern: that what&s;oever concern'd the Rights of any

family, or any per&s;onal pretence, was well and &s;afely over; the Na|tion was united, and of one mind in the rejection of the old Line; there was no danger of it; but no body could &s;ay, that they were of one mind in the rejection of the old form of Government; to which they were &s;till mo&s;t addicted: therefore, they be&s;ought him, out of his love and tenderne&s;s to the Common-wealth, and for the pre&s;erva|tion of the Nation, which had got &s;o much renown and glory under his Conduct, that he would take that Name and Title which had ever pre&s;ided over it, and by which as he could e&s;tabli&s;h a firm Peace at home, &s;o he would find his fame and honour more improved abroad; and that tho&s;e very Princes and Kings, who, out of admiration of his Virtue and noble Actions, had contracted a reverence for his Per&s;on, and an impatient de&s;ire of his friend&s;hip, would look upon him with much more veneration, when they &s;aw him cloathed with the &s;ame Maje&s;ty, and as much their equal in Title as in merit; and would with much more alacrity renew the old Alliances with <HI>England,</HI> when they were renewed in the old form, and under the old title, which would make them durable; &s;ince no foreign Prince could pre&s;ume to take upon him to judge of right of Succe&s;&s;ion; which had been fre|quently changed in all Kingdoms, not only upon the expiration of a <MILESTONE N="20"> Line, but upon deprivation and depo&s;ition; in &s;uch manner as was mo&s;t for the good and benefit of the People; of which there was a fre&s;h In&s;tance in their own Eyes, in the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal;</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> by the Election of the People, a&s;&s;umed the Crown, and Title of King, from the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> who had enjoy'd it quietly, and without Interruption, during three De&s;cents; and he was acknow|ledged as Soveraign of that Kingdom by the late King; who receiv'd&endq; his Emba&s;&s;adors accordingly.</Q></P>
<P>CROMWELL heard the&s;e and the like Arguments with great atten|tion (and wanted not inclination to have concurr'd with them; <Q>he <MILESTONE N="30"> thanked them &startq;for the pains they had taken) to which he would not take upon him to give a pre&s;ent An&s;wer; that he would con&s;ider of all they had &s;aid to him, and re&s;ort to God for coun&s;el; and then he&endq; would &s;end for them,</Q> and acquaint them with his Re&s;olution; and &s;o they parted, all Men &s;tanding at gaze, and in terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, ac|cording to their &s;everal hopes and fears, till they knew what he would determine. All the di&s;pute was now within his own Chamber. There is no que&s;tion the Man was in great agony, and in his own mind did heartily de&s;ire to be King, and thought it the only way to be &s;afe. And it is confidently believed, that upon &s;ome Addre&s;&s;es he had formerly <MILESTONE N="40"> made to &s;ome principal Noble Men of the Kingdom, and &s;ome friendly Expo&s;tulations he had by him&s;elf, or &s;ome Friend, with them, why they re&s;erv'd them&s;elves, and would have no communication or ac+quaintance with him, <Q>the An&s;wer from them all &s;everally (for &s;uch di&s;+cour&s;es could be held but with one at a time) was &startq;that if he would make him&s;elf King, they &s;hould ea&s;ily know what they had to do, but they knew nothing of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience which they were&endq; to pay to a Protector;</Q> and that the&s;e returns fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ed him to that Ambition.</P>
<P>HE was not terrified with the oppo&s;ition that <HI>Lambert</HI> gave him: <MILESTONE N="50"> whom he now looked upon as a declared and mortal Enemy, and one whom he mu&s;t de&s;troy, that he might not be de&s;troy'd by him: nor $$d he much con&s;ider tho&s;e other Officers of the Army, who in the Hou$$

concurr'd with <HI>Lambert;</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;t he did not believe to be great; and if it were, he thought he &s;hould quickly reduce them, a&s;&s;oon as <HI>Lambert</HI> &s;hould be di&s;graced, and his power taken from him. But he trembled at the ob&s;tinacy of tho&s;e who, he knew, loved him; his Bro|ther <HI>Desborough,</HI> and the re&s;t, who depended wholely upon him, and his Greatne&s;s, and who did not wi&s;h his Power and Authority le&s;s ab|&s;olute than it was. And that the&s;e Men &s;hould, with that virulence, with&s;tand this promotion, griev'd him to the heart. He conferr'd with them &s;everally, and endeavour'd, by all the ways he could, to convert <MILESTONE N="10"> them. <Q>But they were all inexorable; and told him re&s;olutely, &startq;that they could do him no good, if they &s;hould adhere to him; and there|fore, they were re&s;olv'd for their own Intere&s;t to leave him, and do the utmo&s;t they could again&s;t him, from the time he a&s;&s;umed that&endq; Title.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT was reported that an Officer of Name, in the eclairci&s;&s;ement upon the Subject, told him re&s;olutely and vehemently, &startq;that if ever he took&endq; the Title of King upon him, he would kill him.</Q> <Q>Certain it is that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was inform'd, and gave credit to it, &startq;that there were a num|ber of Men, who bound them&s;elves by Oath to kill him, within &s;o&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> many hours after he &s;hould accept that Title.</Q> They who were very near him, &s;aid, that in this perplexity he revolv'd his former dream, or apparition, that had fir&s;t inform'd, and promi&s;ed him the high fortune to which he was allready arriv'd, and which was generally &s;poken of even from the beginning of the Troubles, and when he was not in a po&s;ture that promi&s;ed &s;uch exaltation; <Q>and that he then ob&s;erv'd, it had only declared, &startq;that he &s;hould be the greate&s;t Man in <HI>England,&endq;</HI> and &s;hould be near to be King;</Q> which &s;eem'd to imply that he &s;hould be only near, and never actually attain the Crown. Upon the whole matter, after a great di&s;traction of mind, which was manife&s;t in his <MILESTONE N="30"> Countenance to all who then &s;aw him, notwith&s;tanding his Science in di&s;&s;imulation, his courage &s;ail'd him; and after he had &s;pent &s;ome days very unea&s;ily, he &s;ent for the Committee of Parliament to attend him; and, as his looks were extremely di&s;compo&s;ed, and di&s;cover'd a mind full of trouble, and irre&s;olution, &s;o his words were broken and disjoynted, without method, and full of pau&s;es; <Q>with frequent mention of God and his gracious di&s;pen&s;ation, he concluded, &startq;that he could not, with a&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Span$ the Title of King</NOTE> good Con&s;cience, accept the Government under the Title of a King.</Q></P>
<P>MANY were then of opinion, that his Genius at that time for&s;ook him, and yielded to the King's &s;pirit, and that his Reign was near its <MILESTONE N="40"> expiration; and that if his own Courage had not failed, he would ea&s;ily have ma&s;ter'd all oppo&s;ition; that there were many Officers of the Ar|my, who would not have left him, who were for Kingly Government in their own affections; and that the greate&s;t factions in Religion rather promi&s;ed them&s;elves Protection from a &s;ingle Per&s;on, than from a Par|liament, or a new numerous Council: that the fir&s;t Motion for the making him King, was made by one of the mo&s;t wealthy Alderment of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and who &s;erv'd then for the City in Parliament; which was an Argument that that potent Body &s;tood well affected to that Government, and would have joyn'd with him in the defence of it. <MILESTONE N="50"> Others were as confident, that he did very wi&s;ely to decline it; and that, if he had accepted it, he could not have lived many days after. The truth is, the danger was only in &s;ome pre&s;ent A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and de&s;perate Attempt upon his Per&s;on, not from a Revolt of the Army
<PB N="466" REF="4780">
from him; which no particular Man had Intere&s;t enough to corrupt. And he might have &s;ecured him&s;elf, probably, for &s;ome time, from &s;uch an A&s;&s;ault; and when &s;uch de&s;igns are deferr'd, they are commonly di&s;cover'd; as appear'd afterwards, in many Con&s;piracies again&s;t his Life.</P>
<P>HIS intere&s;t and power over the Army was &s;o great, that he had upon the &s;uddain remov'd many of tho&s;e Officers who had the greate&s;t Names in the factions of Religion, as <HI>Harri&s;on, Rich,</HI> and others; who, a&s;&s;oon as they were remov'd, and their Regiments conferr'd on others, were found to be of no &s;ignification, or influence. And it could have been no hard matter for him, upon very few days warning, to have &s;o quarter'd, and modell'd his Troops, as to have &s;ecured him in any en|terpri&s;e he would undertake. And, it may be, there were more Men &s;candalized at his u&s;urping more than the Royal Authority, than would have been at his A&s;&s;umption of the Royal Title too. And therefore they who at that time exerci&s;ed their thoughts with mo&s;t &s;agacity, looked upon that refu&s;al of his as an immediate Act of Almighty God towards the King's Re&s;toration; and many of the &s;obere&s;t Men in the Nation confe&s;&s;ed, after the King's Return, that their dejected Spirits were won|derfully rai&s;ed, and their hopes revived, by that infatuation of his.</P>
<P>BUT his mode&s;ty, or his wi&s;dom, or his fear in the refu&s;ing that &s;u|preme <MILESTONE N="$0"> Title, &s;eem'd not to be attended with the lea&s;t di&s;advantage to him. They who had mo&s;t &s;ignally oppo&s;ed it, were &s;o &s;atisfied that the danger they mo&s;t apprehended was over, that they cared not to cro&s;s any thing el&s;e that was propo&s;ed towards his greatne&s;s; which might be their own another day: and they who had carried on the other de&s;ign, and thereby, as they thought, obliged him, re&s;olved now to give him all the Power which they knew he did de&s;ire, and leave it to his own time, when with le&s;s he&s;itation he might a&s;&s;ume the Title too.

When he was &s;ate in his Chair of State, and after a &s;hort Speech, which was but the Prologue of that by the Speaker of the Parliament <HI>Withrington,</HI> that this promotion might not &s;eem to be without the Nobility's having any &s;hare in it, the Speaker, with the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Whitlock,</HI> ve&s;ted him with a rich purple Velvet <MILESTONE N="20"> Robe lined with Ermines; the Speaker enlarging upon the Maje&s;ty and the Integrity of that Robe. Then the Speaker pre&s;ented him with a fair Bible of the large&s;t edition, richly bound; then he, in the name of all the People, girded a Sword about him; and la&s;tly pre&s;ented him a Scepter of Gold, which he put into his hand, and made him a large di&s;|cour&s;e of tho&s;e Emblems of Government and Authority. Upon the clo&s;e of which, there being little wanting to a perfect formal Corona|tion, but a Crown and an Arch-Bi&s;hop, he took his Oath, admini&s;ter'd to him by the Speaker, in the&s;e words (which among&s;t other things had been &s;ettled by an explanatory Petition and Advice) <Q>&startq;I do, in the pre|&s;ence, <MILESTONE N="30"> and by the Name of Almighty God, promi&s;e and &s;wear, that, to the utmo&s;t of my power, I will uphold, and maintain the true Re|form'd Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tian Religion in the purity thereof, as it is con|tain'd in the Holy Scriptures of the old and new Te&s;tament; and to the utmo&s;t of my power, and under&s;tanding, encourage the profe&s;&s;ion and profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame; and that, to the utmo&s;t of my power, I will endeavour, as Chief Magi&s;trate of the&s;e three Nations, the main|tainance and pre&s;erving of the Peace and Safety, and ju&s;t Rights and Privileges of the People thereof; and &s;hall in all things, according to the be&s;t of my knowledge and power, govern the People of the&s;e three&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> Nations according to Law.</Q></P>

His &s;econd Son <HI>Harry,</HI> who had the reputation of more Vi|gour, he had &s;ent into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and made him his Lieutenant of that Kingdom, that he might be &s;ure to have no di&s;turbance from thence.</P>

There were many rea&s;ons to believe that this young Gentleman, being then of about three or four and twenty years of Age, of great vi|gour and ambition, had many good purpo&s;es, which he thought that Alliance might qualify and enable him to perform. The&s;e Marriages were celebrated at <HI>White-Hall</HI> with all imaginable pomp and lu&s;tre; and it was ob&s;erv'd, that though the Marriages were perform'd in pub|lick View according to the Rites and Ceremonies then in u&s;e, they were pre&s;ently afterwards in private married by Mini&s;ters ordain'd by Bi&s;hops, and according to the form in the Book of Common Prayer; and this with the privity of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who pretended to yield to it in com|pliance <MILESTONE N="30"> with the importunity, and folly of his Daughters.</P>
<P>THESE dome&s;tic Triumphs were confirm'd, and improv'd by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Succe&s;s of his Armes a|broad.</NOTE> Succe&s;s of his Armes abroad. Though the <HI>French</HI> had no mind to ap|ply tho&s;e Forces upon <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> which they were obliged, when taken, to put into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hands, and &s;o march to other places, which they were to conquer to their own u&s;e; in which the &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> under the Command of <HI>Raynolds</HI> attended them, and behaved them|&s;elves eminently well, and in good di&s;cipline; <Q>yet his Emba&s;&s;adour <HI>Lockhart</HI> made &s;uch lively In&s;tances with the Cardinal, with complaints of their breach of Faith, and &s;ome Menaces, &startq;that his Ma&s;ter knew&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> where to find a more punctual Friend;</Q> that a&s;&s;oon as they had taken <HI>Montmedy,</HI> and S^t <HI>Venant,</HI> the Army march'd into <HI>Flanders;</HI> and though the Sea&s;on of the year was too far &s;pent to engage in a Siege before <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI> they &s;ate down before <HI>Mardike;</HI> which was look'd upon as the mo&s;t difficult part of the Work; which being reduced, would facilitate the other very much: <Q>and that Fort they took, and deliver'd it into the hands of <HI>Raynolds,</HI> with an obligation &startq;that they would be&s;iege <HI>Dun|kirk&endq;</HI> the next year, and make it their fir&s;t Attempt.</Q></P>
<P>BUT that which made a noi&s;e indeed, and crown'd his Succe&s;&s;es, was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Victory of his Fleet over the</HI> Spaniard.</NOTE> the Victory his Fleet, under the Command of <HI>Blake,</HI> had obtain'd over <MILESTONE N="50"> the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> which, in truth, with all its Circum&s;tances, was very wonderful, and will never be forgotten in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Canaries.</HI> That Fleet had rode out all the Winter Storms before <HI>Cales</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Portugal,</HI> after they had &s;ent home tho&s;e former Ships which
<PB N="470" REF="4820">
they had taken of the We&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet, and under&s;tood by the Pri|&s;oners, that the other Fleet from <HI>Peru,</HI> which is allways much richer than that of <HI>Mexico,</HI> was undoubtedly at Sea, and would be on the Coa&s;t by the beginning of the Spring, if they receiv'd not Adverti&s;ement of the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet; in which ca&s;e they were mo&s;t like to &s;tay at the <HI>Canaries.</HI> The Admiral concluded, that, notwith&s;tanding all they had done, or could do to block up <HI>Cales,</HI> one way or other they would not be without that Adverti&s;ement; and therefore re&s;olv'd to &s;ail with the whole Fleet to the length of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> that, if it were po&s;&s;ible, they might meet with the Galeons before they came thi|ther; <MILESTONE N="10"> and if they &s;hould be fir&s;t got in thither, they would then con|&s;ider what was to be done.</P>
<P>WITH this re&s;olution the Fleet &s;tood for the Canaries, and about the middle of <HI>April</HI> came thither; and found that the Galeons were got thither before them, and had placed them&s;elves, as they thought, in &s;afety. The &s;maller Ships, being ten in number, lay in a Semicircle, moor'd along the Shore; and the &s;ix great Galeons (the Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen good Ships) which could not come &s;o near the Shore, lay with their broad-&s;ides towards the Offin. Be&s;ides this good po&s;ture in which all the Ships lay, they were cover'd with a &s;trong Ca&s;tle well <MILESTONE N="20"> furni&s;h'd with Guns; and there were &s;ix or &s;even &s;mall Forts, rai&s;ed in the mo&s;t advantageous places of the Bay, every one of them furni&s;h'd with divers good pieces of Cannon; &s;o that they were without the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of their want of &s;ecurity, or imagination that any Men would be &s;o de&s;perate, as to a&s;&s;ault them upon &s;uch apparent di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet came to the mouth of the Bay of <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> and the General &s;aw in what po&s;ture the <HI>Spaniard</HI> lay, he thought it impo&s;&s;ible to bring off any of the Galeons; however, he re&s;olv'd to burn them (which was by many thought to be equally impo&s;&s;ible) and <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ent Captain <HI>Stayner</HI> with a Squadron of the be&s;t Ships to fall upon the Galeons; which he did very re&s;olutely; whil&s;t other Frigats enter|tain'd the Forts, and le&s;&s;er Brea&s;t-works, with continual Broad-&s;ides to hinder their firing. Then the General coming up with the whole Fleet, after full four hours fight, they drove the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from their Ships, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them; yet found that their work was not done; and that it was not only impo&s;&s;ible to carry away the Ships, which they had taken, but that the Wind that had brought them into the Bay, and enabled them to conquer the Enemy, would not &s;erve to carry them out again; &s;o that they lay expo&s;ed to all the Cannon from the Shore; <MILESTONE N="40"> which thunder'd upon them. However, they re&s;olved to do what was in their power; and &s;o, di&s;charging their broad-&s;ides upon the Forts and Land, where they did great execution, they &s;et fire to every Ship, Ga|leons, and others, and burn'd every one of them; which they had no &s;ooner done, but it happen'd the Wind turn'd, and carried the whole Fleet without lo&s;s of one Ship out of the Bay, and put them &s;afe to Sea again.</P>
<P>THE whole Action was &s;o miraculous, that all Men who knew the place, wonder'd that any &s;ober Men, with what courage &s;oever endued, would ever have undertaken it; and they could hardly per&s;wade Them|&s;elves <MILESTONE N="50"> to believe what they had done; whil&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> comforted them&s;elves with the belief, that they were Devils and not Men who had de&s;troyed them in &s;uch a manner. So much a &s;trong re&s;olution of
<PB N="471" REF="4830">
bold and courageous Men can bring to pa&s;s, that no re&s;i&s;tance and ad|vantage of ground can di&s;appoint them. And it can hardly be imagin'd, how &s;mall lo&s;s the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd in this unparallel'd Action; no one Ship being left behind, and the killed and wounded not exceeding two hundred Men, when the Slaughter on board the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships, and on the Shore, was incredible.</P>
<P>THE Fleet after this, having been long abroad, found it nece&s;&s;ary to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blake <HI>returns with the Fleet; dies in the wa$.</HI></NOTE> return home. And this was the la&s;t &s;ervice performed by <HI>Blake;</HI> who &s;icken'd in his Return, and in the very entrance of the Fleet into the <MILESTONE N="10"> Sound of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> expired. He wanted no Pomp of funeral when he was dead, <HI>Cromwell</HI> cau&s;ing him to be brought up by Land to <HI>London</HI> in all the State that could be; and to encourage his Officers to venture their lives, that they might be pompou&s;ly buried, he was, with all the &s;o|lemnity po&s;&s;ible, and at the charge of the publick, interr'd in <HI>Harry</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Burial$ and Chara|cter</NOTE> Seventh's Chapel, among the Monuments of the Kings. He was a Man of a private Extraction; yet had enough left him by his Father to give him a good Education; which his own Inclination di&s;po&s;ed him to re|ceive in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford;</HI> where he took the degree of a Ma&s;ter of Arts; and was enough ver&s;ed in Books for a Man who intended not <MILESTONE N="20"> to be of any Profe&s;&s;ion, having &s;ufficient of his own to maintain him in the plenty he affected, and having then no appearance of Ambition to be a greater Man than he was. He was of a melancholick and a &s;ullen Na|ture, and &s;pent his time mo&s;t with good fellows, who liked his moro&s;e|ne&s;s, and a freedom he u&s;ed in inveighing again&s;t the licence of the time, and the power of the Court. They who knew him inwardly, di&s;cover'd that he had an Anti-Monarchical Spirit, when few Men thought the Go|vernment in any danger. When the Troubles begun, he quickly de|clared him&s;elf again&s;t the King; and having &s;ome Command in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> when it was fir&s;t taken by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> being tru&s;ted with the Command of a little Fort upon the Line, he re|fu&s;ed to give it up, after the Governour had &s;igned the Articles of Sur|render, and kept it &s;ome hours after the Prince was in the Town, and kill'd &s;ome of the Soldiers; for which the Prince re&s;olv'd to hang him, if &s;ome friends had not interpo&s;ed for him, upon his want of experience in War; and prevailed with him to quit the place by very great impor|tunity, and with much difficulty. After this, having done eminent &s;ervice to the Parliament, e&s;pecially at <HI>Taunton,</HI> at Land, He then be|took him&s;elf wholely to the Sea; and quickly made him&s;elf &s;ignal there. He was the fir&s;t Man that declined the old track, and made it manife&s;t <MILESTONE N="40"> that the Science might be attained in le&s;s time than was imagin'd; and de&s;pi&s;ed tho&s;e Rules which had been long in practice, to keep his Ship and his Men out of danger; which had been held in former times a point of great ability and circum&s;pection; as if the principal Art requi&s;ite in the Captain of a Ship had been to be &s;ure to come home &s;afe again. He was the fir&s;t Man who brought the Ships to contemn Ca&s;tles on &s;hore, which had been thought ever very formidable, and were di&s;cover'd by him to make a noi&s;e only, and to fright tho&s;e who could rarely be hurt by them. He was the fir&s;t that infu&s;ed that proportion of courage into the Sea-men, by making them &s;ee by experience, what mighty things <MILESTONE N="50"> they could do, if they were re&s;olved; and taught them to &s;ight in Fire as well as upon Water: and though he hath been very well imitated and followed, he was the fir&s;t that gave the Example of that kind of Naval courage, and bold and re&s;olute Atchievements.</P>

<P>BUT a&s;&s;oon as the Commons came to their Hou&s;e, they cau&s;ed the third Article of the <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> to be read; by which it was provided, that no Members legally cho&s;en &s;hould be excluded from the performance of their Duty, but by con&s;ent of that Hou&s;e of which they were Members. Upon which, they proceeded to the calling over their <MILESTONE N="30"> Hou&s;e, and readmitted pre&s;ently all tho&s;e who had been excluded for <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Hou&s;e of Commons re|admit all their Members, that had been excluded, by Virtue of a Clau&s;e in the</HI> Petition <HI>and</HI> Advice.</NOTE> refu&s;ing to &s;ign that Recognition of the Protector; and by this means, above a hundred of the mo&s;t inveterate Enemies the Protector had, came and &s;ate in the Hou&s;e; among whom were S^r <HI>Harry Vane, Ha&s;lerig,</HI> and many other &s;ignal Men; who had much the more Credit and In|tere&s;t in the Hou&s;e, for having been excluded for their fidelity to the Common-wealth; many of tho&s;e who had &s;ub&s;cribed it, valuing them|&s;elves for having thereby become In&s;truments to introduce them again, who could never otherwi&s;e have come to be readmitted.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the&s;e Men came into the Hou&s;e, they begun to que&s;tion <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tran&s;|actions after|ward.</NOTE> the Authority and Juri&s;diction of the other Hou&s;e; <Q>&startq;that it was true, the <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> had admitted there &s;hould be &s;uch an Hou&s;e; but that it &s;hould be a Hou&s;e of Peers, that they &s;hould be called <HI>My Lords,</HI> there was no provi&s;ion; nor did it appear what Juri&s;diction it &s;hould have: that it would be a very ridiculous thing, if they &s;hould &s;uffer tho&s;e who were created by them&s;elves, and &s;ate only by Their Vote, to be better Men than They, and to have a Negative Voice to&endq; controle their Ma&s;ters.</Q> <Q>When they had enough vilified them, they que&s;tion'd the Protector's Authority to &s;end Writs to call them thither: &startq;Who gave him that Authority to make Peers? that it had been the <MILESTONE N="50"> proper bu&s;ine&s;s of that Hou&s;e to have provided for all this; which it is probable they would have done at this meeting, if he had not pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly&endq; taken that Soveraign power upon him.</Q></P>

CROMWELL was exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed, and perplexed with this new Spirit; and found that he had been &s;hort-&s;ighted in not having pro|vided, at the &s;ame time, for the filling his Hou&s;e of Commons, when he erected his other of Peers: for he had taken away tho&s;e out of that Hou&s;e who were the bolde&s;t Speakers, and be&s;t able to oppo&s;e this torrent, to in&s;titute this other Hou&s;e, without &s;upplying tho&s;e other places by Men who could as well undergo the Work of the other. However, he made <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>convenes both Hou&s;es, and &s;peaks to them.</HI></NOTE> one effort more; and conven'd both Hou&s;es before him; and very Ma|gi&s;terially, and in a Dialect he had never u&s;ed before, reprehended them <MILESTONE N="10"> for pre&s;uming to que&s;tion his Authority. <Q>&startq;The other Hou&s;e, he &s;aid,&endq; were Lords, and &s;hould be Lords;</Q> <Q>and commanded Them &startq;to enter upon &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, as might be for the benefit, not the di&s;traction of&endq; the Common-wealth;</Q> which he would with God's Help prevent. And when he found this Animadver&s;ion did not reform them, but that they continued in their pre&s;umption, and every day improv'd their re|proaches and contempt of him, he went to his Hou&s;e of Lords upon the fourth of <HI>February;</HI> <Q>and &s;ending for the Commons, after he had u&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He Di&s;&s;olves that Parlia|ment</HI> Feb. 4.</NOTE> many &s;harp expre&s;&s;ions of indignation, he told them, &startq;that it concern'd his Intere&s;t, as much as the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nation, to <MILESTONE N="20"> di&s;&s;olve that Parliament; and therefore he did put an end to their&endq; &s;itting.</Q> So that Cloud was, for the pre&s;ent, di&s;&s;ipated, that threaten'd &s;o great a Storm.</P>
<P>THE Parliament being di&s;&s;olv'd, <HI>Cromwell</HI> found him&s;elf at ea&s;e to pro&s;ecute his other de&s;igns. After the taking of <HI>Mardike, Raynolds,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Raynolds <HI>ca&s;t away coming out of</HI> Flan|ders.</NOTE> who was Commander in chief of that Body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the Service of <HI>France,</HI> endeavouring to give his Friends in <HI>England</HI> a vi&s;it, was, together with &s;ome other Officers who accompanied him, ca&s;t away, and drown'd at Sea; upon which, before the di&s;&s;olution of the Parlia|ment, <HI>Lockhart,</HI> who was the Protector's Emba&s;&s;adour in <HI>France,</HI> was <MILESTONE N="30"> de&s;ign'd to take that Charge upon him; and all things, which were to be tran&s;ported from <HI>England,</HI> for the pro&s;ecution of the bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Flan|ders</HI> the next Spring, were di&s;patch'd with the more care, and punctua|lity, that there might be no room left for the Cardinal to imagine, that the Protector was in any degree perplexed with the contradiction, and ill humour of the Parliament.</P>
<P>ASSOON as he was rid of That, he thought it as nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome In&s;tances at home, how little he feared tho&s;e Men who were thought to be &s;o much his Rivals in power, and in the opinion of the Army, that he dur&s;t not di&s;oblige them. And therefore, after &s;ome <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;harp expo&s;tulations with <HI>Lambert,</HI> who was as po&s;itive in his own hu|mour, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>turns</HI> Lambert <HI>out of the Ar|my.</HI></NOTE> he &s;ent to him for his Commi&s;&s;ion; which he &s;ullenly gave up, when there was a general imagination that he would have refu&s;ed to have deliver'd it. So he was deprived of his Regiment, his authority in the Army, and of being Major General in the North, in an in&s;tant, without the lea&s;t appearance of contradiction or murmur; and the Of|ficers <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ub&s;tituted in the &s;everal places, found all the obedience that had been paid to the other; and <HI>Lambert</HI> retired to his Garden as unvi&s;ited and untaken notice of, as if he had never been in authority; which gave great reputation to the Protector, that he was entire Ma&s;ter <MILESTONE N="50"> of his Army.</P>
<P>HE had ob&s;erved, throughout the Parliament, that the Major Ge|nerals were extremely odious to the People, as they had been formida|ble to Him. For, whil&s;t his Party were pro&s;ecuting to have his Autho|rity
<PB N="474" REF="4860">
confirm'd to him, and that he might have the Title of King con|ferr'd upon him, <HI>Lambert</HI> was as &s;ollicitous to have the Major Generals confirmed by Parliament, and to have their dependence only upon it; which, with the authority they had of li&s;ting Men in a readine&s;s, would have made their power, and their &s;trength, in a &s;hort time to be equal to the other's. Now that was over, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was content to continue their Names, that they might &s;till be formidable in the Countries, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">He abridges the power of his Major Ge|nerals.</NOTE> abridged them of all that power which might be inconvenient to Him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HE took likewi&s;e an occa&s;ion from an accident that happen'd, to amu&s;e the People with the apprehen&s;ion of Plots at home to facilitate <MILESTONE N="10"> an Inva&s;ion from abroad; and &s;ending for the Lord Mayor and Alder|men to attend him, he made them a large di&s;cour&s;e of the danger they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He acquaints the L Mayor</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of the Ci|ty with a Plot of the Cava|liers, and the Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s be|ing in</HI> Eng|land.</NOTE> were in of being &s;urpri&s;ed; <Q>&startq;that there was a de&s;ign to &s;ei&s;e upon the Tower; and at the &s;ame time that there &s;hould be a general In&s;urrection in the City of the Cavaliers, and di&s;contented Party, whil&s;t the City remain'd &s;o &s;ecure, that they had put their Militia into no po&s;ture to be ready to pre&s;erve them&s;elves in &s;uch an Attempt; but on the con|trary, that they were &s;o negligent in their Di&s;cipline, that the Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had lain &s;ecurely in the City full three Weeks without being di&s;cover'd; who was &s;ent over by the King to countenance a ge|neral <MILESTONE N="20"> In&s;urrection, whil&s;t the King him&s;elf, he &s;aid, had ten thou&s;and Men ready at <HI>Bruges,</HI> with two and twenty Ships, with which he meant&endq; to invade &s;ome other more Northern part of the Kingdom.</Q> <Q>He wi&s;h'd them &startq;to lo&s;e no time in putting their Militia into a good po&s;ture, and to make very &s;trict &s;earches to di&s;cover what Strangers were harbour'd&endq; within the Walls of the City, and to keep good Watches every night.</Q> He order'd double Guards to be &s;et about the Tower; and that they might &s;ee that there was more than ordinary Occa&s;ion for all this, he cau&s;ed very many Per&s;ons of all conditions, mo&s;t of them &s;uch as were rea&s;onably to be &s;u&s;pected to be of the King's Party, to be &s;urpri&s;ed in <MILESTONE N="30"> the night in their Beds (for tho&s;e circum&s;tances made all that was done <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Per&s;ons &s;ei&s;ed on upon that Account.</NOTE> to be the more notorious) and after &s;ome &s;hort Examination, to be &s;ent to the Tower; and to other Pri&s;ons; for there was, at the &s;ame time, the &s;ame &s;everity u&s;ed in the &s;everal Counties; for the better explana|tion, and under&s;tanding whereof, it will be nece&s;&s;ary now that We re|turn to <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>WITHIN little more than two Months after the King's coming to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Affairs in</HI> Flanders.</NOTE> <HI>Bruges,</HI> the little Treaty which had been &s;ign'd by the Arch-Duke with the King, was &s;ent ratified from <HI>Madrid</HI> by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with many great compliments; which the King was willing &s;hould be believ'd <MILESTONE N="40"> to be of extraordinary Importance. After wonderful excu&s;es for the Low|ne&s;s of their affairs in all places, which di&s;abled them to perform tho&s;e Services which are due from, and to a great King, <Q>they let his Maje|&s;ty know, &startq;that the Catholick King had a&s;&s;igned &s;o many Crowns as amounted to &s;ix thou&s;and Guilders, to be paid every Month towards a Royal aid; and half &s;o much more, for the &s;upport of the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter;</HI> that though the Sum was very &s;mall, it was as much as their nece&s;&s;ities would bear; and the &s;mallne&s;s &s;hould be recompen&s;ed&endq; by the punctuality of the payment;</Q> the fir&s;t payment being to be made about the middle of the next Month; without taking notice that <MILESTONE N="50"> the King had been already in that Country near three Months, during which time he had not received the lea&s;t Pre&s;ent, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards his &s;upport.</P>

THEY were willing that the King &s;hould rai&s;e four Regiments of Foot, which &s;hould march with their Army, until the King &s;hould find the &s;ea&s;on ripe to make an Inva&s;ion with that other &s;upply which they were bound by the Treaty to give. But for the rai&s;ing tho&s;e four Regiments, there was not one penny allow'd, or any other encourage|ment, than little Quarters to bring their Men to; and, after their Mu&s;ter, the common allowance of Bread. However, the King was glad of the opportunity to employ, and di&s;po&s;e of many Officers and Soldiers, who flock'd to him from the time of his fir&s;t coming into <HI>Flanders.</HI> He re|&s;olv'd <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King rai&s;es four Re|giments of his Subjects in</HI> Flanders</NOTE> to rai&s;e one Regiment of Guards, the Command whereof he gave to the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> which was to do duty in the Army as common Men, till his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be in &s;uch a po&s;ture, that they might be brought about his Per&s;on. The Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had a Regiment in order to be commanded by his Lieutenant Colonel, that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> might be tempted to come over. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> would have a Regi|ment, that &s;uch Officers and Soldiers might re&s;ort to, who were de&s;irous to &s;erve under his Command: and becau&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> had many Officers about the Court, who pretended that they could draw many of their Country Men to them, the King gave the fourth Regiment to the Lord <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Newburgh,</HI> a Nobleman of that Kingdom, of great courage; who had &s;erv'd his Father and him&s;elf with very &s;ignal fidelity. Tho&s;e four Re|giments were rai&s;ed with more expedition than can be imagined, upon &s;o little encouragement.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the Treaty was confirm'd, in truth, from the time that his Maje&s;ty came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and that he re&s;olv'd to make as entire a Conjunction with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as they would permit, he gave no|tice to the King of <HI>France,</HI> that he would no longer receive that Pen|&s;ion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King no longer receives any Pen&s;ion from</HI> France.</NOTE> which, during the time he had remain'd at <HI>Cologne,</HI> had been rea|&s;onably well paid; but, after his coming into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he never would <MILESTONE N="30"> receive any part of it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army was at this time before <HI>Conde;</HI> a place garri&s;on'd by the <HI>French</HI> between <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> and <HI>Cambray;</HI> which was in|ve&s;ted now by <HI>Don Juan;</HI> who finding that the greate&s;t part of the Gar|ri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and that there was in it a Regiment commanded by <HI>Muskery,</HI> a nephew of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> he thought this a good &s;ea&s;on to manife&s;t the dependence the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had upon the King; and therefore writ to his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Bruges,</HI> and de&s;ired that he would <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>&s;ent to treat with the Lord</HI> Muskery <HI>at</HI> Cond&egrave; <HI>about his Regiment.

<PB N="476" REF="4880">
he would prevail with tho&s;e of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation, when they march'd out, to enter into the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Service, that is, as they call'd it, to &s;erve their own King: for they talked of nothing but going over in the Winter into <HI>England;</HI> e&s;pecially they de&s;ired that his Nephew <HI>Muskery,</HI> who had the reputation of a &s;tout and an excellent Officer, as in truth he was, would come over with his Regiment, which was much the be&s;t, what|ever the other would do.

<P>MUSKERY march'd away with the re&s;t of the Garri&s;on; and a&s;&s;oon as he was in <HI>France,</HI> rode to <HI>Paris;</HI> where the Cardinal then was; who receiv'd him with extraordinary Grace; but when he asked his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, <MILESTONE N="40"> and urged his Capitulation, the Cardinal, by all imaginable care&s;&s;es, and promi&s;es of a pen&s;ion, endeavour'd to divert him from the inclination; <Q>told him, &startq;that this was only to &s;erve the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and not his own King; who had no employment for him; that if he would &s;tay in their &s;ervice till the King had need of him, he would take care to &s;end Him, and his Regiment, in a better condition to his Maje&s;ty, than they&endq; were now in.</Q> When he could neither by promi&s;es, nor reproaches, divert him from quitting their &s;ervice, he gave him a Pa&s;s only for Him|&s;elf; and expre&s;ly refu&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s the Regiment; <Q>averring, &startq;that he was not bound to it, becau&s;e there could be no pretence that they <MILESTONE N="50"> could &s;erve the King; who had no u&s;e of them, nor wherewithal to&endq; pay them.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN the Marquis propo&s;ed any thing that concern'd the King, during the time he was in the Army, <HI>Don Juan</HI> &s;till writ to <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> to confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer about it; who found <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Exche|quer's Confe|rences with</HI> Don Alonzo.</NOTE> <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> in all re&s;pects &s;o untractable, and &s;o ab&s;olutely govern'd by the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Je&s;uit, who filled his head with the hopes of the Levellers, that, after he had receiv'd the Money that was a&s;&s;ign'd to the King, he return'd to <HI>Bruges,</HI> as the Marquis did from the Army, when the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of <HI>Conde</HI> was over.</P>
<P>IT was well enough known, at lea&s;t generally believ'd, from the time <MILESTONE N="20"> that the &s;ecret confidence begun between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Cardinal, and long before <HI>Lockhart</HI> appear'd there as Emba&s;&s;adour, that the Car|dinal had not only promi&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that the King &s;hould receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from thence; but that no body who related to his Service, or again&s;t whom any exception &s;hould be taken, &s;hould be permitted to re&s;ide&endq; in <HI>France;</HI></Q> and that, as the King had already been driven thence; &s;o, when the time &s;hould be ripe, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> would be likewi&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;itated to leave that Kingdom.

<P>AMONGST tho&s;e who by that &s;ecret Article were to leave the <HI>French</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> Service, the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was one; who&s;e Name was, as was generally believ'd, put into the Article by the Cardinal, rather than by <HI>Cromwell.</HI> For the Earl, having receiv'd very great obligations from the Cardinal, thought his Intere&s;t greater in the Queen than in truth it was (accord|ing to his Natural cu&s;tom of deceiving him&s;elf) and &s;o, in the Cardi|nal's di&s;grace and retirement, had &s;hew'd him&s;elf le&s;s inclined to his re|turn than he ought to have been; which the Cardinal never forgave; yet treated him with the &s;ame familiarity as before (which the Earl took for pure friend&s;hip) until the time came for the publi&s;hing this Treaty, <MILESTONE N="50"> when the Earl was Lieutenant General of the Army in <HI>Italy.</HI> Then he &s;ent for him; and bewailed the condition that <HI>France</HI> was in, <Q>&startq;which obliged them to receive Commands from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> which were very&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Bri&s;tol <HI>order'd al&s;o to leave</HI> France</NOTE> unea&s;y to them; then told him,</Q> <Q>&startq;that he could &s;tay no longer in their

So he came directly <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comes to</HI> Bru|ges <HI>to the King.</HI></NOTE> for <HI>Bruges</HI> to the King; to whom he had made him&s;elf in &s;ome degree gracious before his Maje&s;ty left <HI>Paris.</HI> But his bu&s;ine&s;s there was only to pre&s;ent his Duty to his Maje&s;ty; where after he had &s;tayed two or three days, he made his journey to the Army to offer his Service to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> without &s;o much as de&s;iring any recommendation from the King.</P>
<P>THERE was nothing more known, than that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had all imaginable prejudice and hatred again&s;t the Earl, both for the little kindne&s;s he had &s;hew'd towards them in <HI>England,</HI> whil&s;t he was Secre|tary of State, of which <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> was a faithful Remembrancer, and <MILESTONE N="20"> for the more than ordinary Animo&s;ity he had expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t them from the time that he had been in the <HI>French</HI> Service; which anger'd them the more, becau&s;e he had been born in <HI>Spain.</HI> He had then like|wi&s;e render'd him&s;elf particularly odious to <HI>Flanders;</HI> where he was proclaim'd, and dete&s;ted, in all the Rhymes and Songs of the Country, for the &s;avage Outrages his Forces had committed by fire and plunder, two years before, when he made a Winter Incur&s;ion with his Troops into that Country, and committed greater Wa&s;t than ever the <HI>French</HI> Them|&s;elves had done, when the Forces were commanded by Them. Upon all which, his Friends di&s;&s;waded him at <HI>Bruges</HI> from going to the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> Army, where he would receive very cold treatment. But he &s;miled at the adverti&s;ement; <Q>and told them, &startq;that all the time he was in <HI>France,</HI> he was out of his Sphere; and that his own Genius allways di&s;po&s;ed&endq; him to <HI>Spain;</HI></Q> where he was now re&s;olv'd to make his Fortune. And with this confidence he left <HI>Bruges,</HI> and went to the Army, when it had newly taken <HI>Conde;</HI> where he found his reception &s;uch, both from <HI>Don Juan</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> as he had rea&s;on to expect; which did not at all deject him.</P>
<P>HE was pre&s;ent when <HI>Don Juan</HI> eat, and when he u&s;ed to di&s;cour&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ingratiates him&s;elf with</HI> Don Juan, <HI>notwith&s;tand|ing the great prejudice the</HI> Spaniards <HI>had again&s;t him.</HI></NOTE> of all things at large; and mo&s;t willingly of Schola&s;tic points, if his <MILESTONE N="40"> Confe&s;&s;or, or any other Learned Per&s;on, was pre&s;ent. The Earl allways interpo&s;ed in tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es with an admirable acutene&s;s, which, be|&s;ides his exactne&s;s in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Language, made his parts wonder'd at by every Body; and <HI>Don Juan</HI> begun to be very much plea&s;ed with his Company; and the more, becau&s;e he was much given to &s;peculations in A&s;trology; in which he found the Earl &s;o much more conver&s;ant than any Man he had met with, that, within a Week after he had fir&s;t &s;een him, he de&s;ired the Earl to calculate his Nativity. In a word, his pre&s;ence grew to be very acceptable to <HI>Don Juan;</HI> which when the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> di&s;cern'd, he likewi&s;e treated him with more <MILESTONE N="50"> re&s;pect; in which he found likewi&s;e his account: for the Earl having been Lieutenant General of the <HI>French</HI> Army under Prince <HI>Thomas,</HI> in conjunction with the Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Millain,</HI> the very

year before, when the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> was Governour there, he could both di&s;cour&s;e the &s;everal Tran&s;actions there with the Marquis, and knew how to take fit occa&s;ions, both in his pre&s;ence and ab&s;ence, to magnify his Conduct in &s;ignal Actions; which the Marquis was very glad to &s;ee, and hear, that he did very frequently. And <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> being &s;ent for to the Army to con&s;ult &s;ome Affair, though he had all imaginable dete&s;tation of the Earl, and had prepared as much prejudice towards him in <HI>Don Juan</HI> and the Marquis, when he found him in &s;o much favour with both, he treated him likewi&s;e with more regard; and <MILESTONE N="10"> was well content to hear him&s;elf commended by him for under&s;tanding the Affairs of <HI>England;</HI> which he de&s;ired <HI>Don Juan</HI> and the Marquis &s;hould believe him to do. So that before he had been a Month in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> he had perfectly reconciled him&s;elf to the Court, and to the Army; and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and diverted all the prejudice that had been again&s;t him; and <HI>Don Juan</HI> invited him to &s;pend the Winter with him at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was another Accident likewi&s;e fell out at this time, as if it had been produced by his own Stars. The <HI>French</HI> had yet a Garri&s;on at a place call'd S^t <HI>Ghi&s;lain;</HI> which, being within few leagues of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is In&s;tru|mental in re|covering S^t.</HI> Ghi&s;lain <HI>to the</HI> Spaniards</NOTE> infe&s;ted the whole Country very much, and even put them into mutiny <MILESTONE N="20"> again&s;t the Court, that they would think of any other expedition be|fore they had reduced that Garri&s;on; which was &s;o &s;trong that they had once attempted it, and were obliged to de&s;i&s;t. Half the Garri&s;on were <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Schomberg,</HI> an Officer of the fir&s;t Rank. Some of the Officers were nearly ally'd to S^r <HI>George Lane,</HI> who was Secretary to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>and had written to him to know, &startq;whether the giving up that place would be a &s;ervice to the King?&endq; and if it would, they would undertake it.</Q> The Marquis &s;ent his Se|cretary to inform the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> of it; who looked upon it as an op|portunity &s;ent from Heaven to rai&s;e his Fortune with the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> He <MILESTONE N="30"> communicated it to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> as a matter in his own di&s;po&s;al, and to be conducted by Per&s;ons who had a dependence upon him, but yet who intended it only as a &s;ervice to the King. So now he became en|tru&s;ted between the King and <HI>Don Juan;</HI> which he had from the be|ginning contrived to be; <HI>Don Juan</HI> being very glad to find he had &s;o much Intere&s;t in the King, and the King well plea&s;ed that he had &s;uch credit with <HI>Don Juan,</HI> of who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the next Winter he thought he &s;hould have much u&s;e; for all Attempts upon <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t be in the Winter. In a word, this Affair of S^t <HI>Ghi&s;lain</HI> was very acceptable to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> their Campagne being ended without any other con&s;i|derable <MILESTONE N="40"> Action than the taking of <HI>Conde.</HI> They fore&s;aw a very &s;ad year would &s;ucceed, if they &s;hould enter into the field, where they were &s;ure the <HI>French</HI> would be early, and leave S^t <HI>Ghi&s;lain</HI> behind them; and they &s;hould run more hazard if they begun with the Siege of that place; and therefore they authori&s;ed the Earl, to promi&s;e great rewards in Money, and Pen&s;ions, to tho&s;e Officers, and Soldiers, who would contribute to the reduction of it. The matter was &s;o well carried, that <HI>Don Juan</HI> a&s;&s;embling his Army together a little before <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> in a very great fro&s;t, and coming before the place, though <HI>Schomberg</HI> di&s;|cover'd the Con&s;piracy, and apprehended two or three of the Officers, <MILESTONE N="50"> yet the Soldiers, which were upon the Guards in &s;ome out-Forts, de|claring them&s;elves at the &s;ame time, and receiving the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he was compell'd to make Conditions, and to give up the place, that he he might have liberty to march away with the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="4920">
THIS &s;ervice was of very great importance to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and of no le&s;s detriment to the <HI>French,</HI> and con&s;equently gave great reputa|tion to the Earl; <Q>who then came to the King at <HI>Bruges,</HI> and &s;aid all that he thought fit of <HI>Don Juan</HI> to the King, and, among&s;t the re&s;t, &startq;that <HI>Don Juan</HI> advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to &s;end &s;ome di&s;creet Per&s;on to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to &s;ollicite his Affairs there; but that he did not think the&endq; Per&s;on he had de&s;ign'd to &s;end thither (who was S^r <HI>Harry de Vic,</HI></Q> <Q>that had been long Re&s;ident in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els)</HI> &startq;&endq;would be acceptable there.</Q> This was only to introduce another Per&s;on, who was dear to him, S^r <HI>Henry Bennet,</HI> who had been formerly in his Office when he was Secretary <MILESTONE N="10"> of State, and bred by him; and was now Secretary to the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> but upon the factions that were in that Family was &s;o unea&s;y in his place, that he de&s;ired to be in any other Po&s;t; and was about this time come to the King, as a forerunner to inform him of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s purpo&s;e to be &s;peedily with him, being within few days to take his leave of the Court of <HI>France. Bennet</HI> had been long a Per&s;on very acceptable to the King; and therefore his Maje&s;ty readily con&s;ented, that he &s;hould <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He obtains of the King that S^r</HI> H.

<P>THE time was now come that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>leaves</HI> Paris, <HI>and comes to the King at</HI> Bru|ges.</NOTE> to leave <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;o came to the King to <HI>Bruges;</HI> where there were then all the vi&s;ible hopes of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> together, and all the Royal I&s;&s;ue of the late King, the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta</HI> only excepted; for, be&s;ides the King and his two Brothers, the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Glo|ce&s;ter,</HI> the Prince&s;s Royal of <HI>Orange</HI> made that her way from <HI>Paris</HI> in|to the Low Countries, and &s;tayed there &s;ome days with her Brothers.</P>
<P>IT was at this time that the King made the Chancellor of the Exche|quer <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor of the Exche|quer made Lord Chan|cellor.</NOTE> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> S^r <HI>Edward Herbert,</HI> who was the la&s;t Lord Keeper of the great Seal, being lately dead at <HI>Paris.</HI> Now <MILESTONE N="30"> the King put the Seal, which he had till then kept Him&s;elf, into the hands of the Chancellor; which he receiv'd very unwillingly: but the King fir&s;t employed the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> with whom his Maje&s;ty knew he had an entire friend&s;hip, to di&s;po&s;e him to receive it; which when he could not do (he giving him many rea&s;ons, be&s;ides his own unfitne&s;s, why there was no need of &s;uch an Officer, or indeed any u&s;e of the Great Seal till the King &s;hould come into <HI>England;</HI> <Q>and &startq;that his Maje&s;ty found &s;ome ea&s;e in being without &s;uch an Officer, that he was not troubled with tho&s;e Suites, which he would be, if the Seal were in the hands of a proper Officer to be u&s;ed, &s;ince every Body <MILESTONE N="40"> would be then importuning the King for the Grant of Offices, Ho|nours, and Lands, which would give him great vexation to refu&s;e,&endq; and do him as great mi&s;chief by granting.</Q> The which when the Mar|quis told the King) his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf went to the Chancellor's lodg|ing, and took notice of what the Marquis had told him; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he would deal truly and freely with him; that the principal rea&s;on which he had alledged again&s;t receiving the Seal, was the greate&s;t rea&s;on that&endq; di&s;po&s;ed him to confer it upon him.</Q> Thereupon he pulled Letters out of his pocket, which he receiv'd lately from <HI>Paris</HI> for the Grant of &s;e|veral Rever&s;ions in <HI>England</HI> of Offices, and of Lands; one whereof was <MILESTONE N="50"> of the Queen's Hou&s;e and Lands of <HI>Oatlands,</HI> to the &s;ame Man who had purcha&s;ed it from the State; who would willingly have paid a good Sum of Money to that Per&s;on who was to procure &s;uch a confirmation
<PB N="481" REF="4930">
of his Title; the draught whereof was prepared at <HI>London,</HI> upon con|fidence that it would have the Seal pre&s;ently put to it; which being in the King's own hand, none need, as they thought, to be privy to the &s;ecret. His Maje&s;ty told him al&s;o of many other Importunities, with which he was every day di&s;quieted; <Q>and &startq;that he &s;aw no other Remedy to give him&s;elf ea&s;e, than to put the Seal out of his own keeping, into&endq; &s;uch hands as would not be importuned, and would help him to deny.</Q> And thereupon he conjured the Chancellor to receive that Tru&s;t, with many gracious promi&s;es of his favour and protection. Whereupon the <MILESTONE N="10"> Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> u&s;ing likewi&s;e Their per&s;wa|&s;ions, he &s;ubmitted to the King's plea&s;ure; who deliver'd the Seal to him in the Council, in the <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> time in the year 1657; which particular is only fit to be mention'd, becau&s;e many great Affairs, and &s;ome Alterations accompanied, though not attended upon it.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;o long and &s;o dark a retirement in <HI>Cologne,</HI> the King's very coming into <HI>Flanders</HI> rai&s;ed the Spirits of his Friends in <HI>England.</HI> And when they were a&s;&s;ured that there was a Treaty &s;ign'd between his Ma|je&s;ty and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they made no doubt of an Army &s;ufficient to begin the bu&s;ine&s;s, and then that the general affections of the King|dom <MILESTONE N="20"> would fini&s;h it. The King, who had hitherto re&s;train'd his Friends from expo&s;ing them&s;elves to unnece&s;&s;ary dangers, thought it now fit to encourage them to put them&s;elves into &s;uch a po&s;ture, that they might be ready to joyn with him when he appear'd; which he hoped the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would enable him to do in the depth of Winter. <Q>Several Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> to a&s;&s;ure him, &startq;that there was &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tran&s;action of the $Span$</HI></NOTE> univer&s;al a readine&s;s there, that they could hardly be per&s;waded to&endq; &s;tay to expect the King, but they would begin the Work Them&s;elves:</Q> yet they complain'd much of the backwardne&s;s of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t tru&s;ted by the King, and They again as much inveighed again&s;t the ra&s;h|ne&s;s <MILESTONE N="30"> and precipitation of the other, <Q>&startq;that they would ruin them&s;elves,&endq; and all People who &s;hould joyn with them.</Q></P>
<P>THE King was much perplexed to di&s;cover this di&s;temper among&s;t tho&s;e, who, if they were united, would find the Work very hard; and though he preferr'd in his own opinion the judgement of tho&s;e that were mo&s;t wary, yet it concern'd him to prevent the other from appearing in an un&s;ea&s;onable Engagement; <Q>and therefore He &s;ent to them, and conjured them &startq;to attempt nothing, till he &s;ent a Per&s;on to them, who, if they were ready, &s;hould have Authority enough to per&s;wade the re&s;t to a conjunction with them, and &s;hould him&s;elf be fit to conduct them&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> in any rea&s;onable Enterpri&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had frankly offer'd to the King, &startq;that he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which was the occa&s;ion of the Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s go+ing into</HI> Eng|land.</NOTE> would privately go into <HI>England,</HI> and confer with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t forward; and if he found, that their coun&s;els were di&s;creetly laid, he would encourage them, and unite all the re&s;t to them; and if mat|ters&endq; were not ripe, he would compo&s;e them to be quiet;</Q> and there was no Man in <HI>England</HI> affected to the King's Service, who would not be readily advi&s;ed by him. The Chancellor would by no means con&s;ent to his journey, as an unrea&s;onable Adventure upon an improbable de|&s;ign, &s;eeing no ground to imagine they could do any thing. But the <MILESTONE N="50"> Marquis exceedingly undervalued any imagination of danger; and it cannot be conceiv'd, with what &s;ecurity all Men ventur'd every day, in the heigth of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s jealou&s;y and vigilance, to go into <HI>England,</HI> and to &s;tay a Month in <HI>London,</HI> and return again. The King con&s;enting to
<PB N="482" REF="4940">
the journey, the chief care was, that the Marquis's ab&s;ence from <HI>Bruges</HI> might not create jealou&s;y, and di&s;cour&s;e, <Q>&startq;&endq;whither he &s;hould be gone.</Q> <Q>Therefore it was for &s;ome time di&s;cour&s;ed, &startq;that the Marquis of <HI>Or|mond&endq;</HI></Q> was to go into <HI>Germany</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> (who was known to have affection for the King) and <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould from thence&endq; bring with him two Regiments for the Service of his Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>THESE di&s;cour&s;es being generally made and believ'd, the Marquis took his Leave publickly of the King, with his Servants fit for &s;uch a journey, who continued the Journey towards <HI>Germany;</HI> &s;o that the Letters from <HI>Cologne</HI> to all places gave an Account of the Marquis of <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Ormond</HI>'s being there; whil&s;t he him&s;elf, with one only Servant, and <HI>ONeile</HI> (who had encouraged him very much to that undertaking) took the way of <HI>Holland;</HI> and hired a Bark at <HI>Schevelin;</HI> in which they em|barked, and were &s;afely landed in <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> from whence, without any trouble, they got to <HI>London,</HI> whil&s;t the Parliament was &s;till &s;itting. When he was there, he found means to &s;peak with mo&s;t of tho&s;e of any condition upon who&s;e Advice, and Intere&s;t, the King mo&s;t depended, and again&s;t who&s;e po&s;itive Advice his Maje&s;ty would not &s;uffer any thing to be attempted. That which troubled him mo&s;t was to di&s;cover a jea|lou&s;y, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The temper he found the King's friends in.</NOTE> or rather an Animo&s;ity between many of tho&s;e who equally wi&s;h'd <MILESTONE N="20"> the King's Re&s;toration, to that degree, that they would neither confer nor corre&s;pond with each other. They who had the mo&s;t experience, and were of the greate&s;t reputation with tho&s;e who would appear when any thing was to be done, but would not expo&s;e them&s;elves in Meetings or Corre&s;pondencies before, <Q>complain'd very much of &startq;the ra&s;hne&s;s of the other, who believ'd any Officer of the Army that pretended di&s;|content, and would pre&s;ently de&s;ire them to communicate with &s;uch Per&s;ons; which becau&s;e they refu&s;ed (as they had rea&s;on) the others loaded them with reproaches, as having lo&s;t all affection and zeal for&endq; his Maje&s;ty's Service.</Q> <Q>They prote&s;ted, &startq;that they could not di&s;cover <MILESTONE N="30"> or believe that there was any &s;uch preparations in readine&s;s, that it could be coun&s;ellable to appear in Armes again&s;t a Government &s;o for|tified, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, as the Protector's &s;eem'd to be: that it was pro|bable the Parliament might not comply with <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s de&s;ires; and then there was &s;uch a di&s;covery of Malice between &s;everal Per&s;ons of potent Condition, that many advantages might be offer'd to the King's Party: if they would have the patience to attend the event, and till tho&s;e Factions &s;hould be engaged in blood, they might be &s;ure to ad|vance the King's Intere&s;t in di&s;po&s;ing of them&s;elves; but if they &s;hould engage, before &s;uch a time, in any In&s;urrection, or by &s;ei&s;ing &s;ome in|&s;ignificant <MILESTONE N="40"> Town, all di&s;&s;enting Parties would be reconciled, till the King's friends &s;hould all be ruin'd, though they might afterwards re|turn&endq; to their old Animo&s;ities.</Q> <Q>In a word, though they appear'd very wary, they declared &s;uch a re&s;ignation to the King's plea&s;ure, &startq;that, if the Marquis were &s;atisfied, upon his conference with other Men, that the time was ripe for their appearance in Armes, they would pre&s;ent|ly receive his Orders; and do what he &s;hould require, how un&s;ucce&s;s|fully&endq; &s;oever.</Q></P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, there were many younger Men, who, having had no part in the former War, were impatient to &s;hew their courage <MILESTONE N="50"> and affection to the King. And tho&s;e Men, being acquainted with ma|ny of the old Officers of the late King's Army, who &s;aw many of their old Soldiers now in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Army, and found them to talk after
<PB N="483" REF="4950">
their old manner, concluded that they would all appear for the King, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould &s;ee his Colours flying. The&s;e Men talking toge|ther, would often di&s;cour&s;e, how ea&s;y a thing it would be, with two Troops of Hor&s;e, to beat up &s;uch a Quarter, or &s;ei&s;e &s;uch a Guard; and then tho&s;e Men con&s;ulted how to get tho&s;e Troops, and found Men who had li&s;ted &s;o many, which would be ready upon call. There were allways in the&s;e Meetings &s;ome Citizens, who undertook for the affection of the City; and &s;ome of the&s;e made little doubt of &s;ei&s;ing upon the Tower. And truly the putting many Gentlemen's Sons as ap|prentices into the City, &s;ince the beginning of the Troubles, had made <MILESTONE N="10"> a great alteration, at lea&s;t in the general talk of that People. It was upon this kind of Materials, that many hone&s;t Men did build their hopes, and upon &s;ome a&s;&s;urances they had from Officers of the Army, who were as little to be depended upon.</P>
<P>THERE was another particular, which had principally contributed to this di&s;temper, which pa&s;&s;ing from hand to hand had made Men im|patient to be in Armes; which was an opinion, that the King was even ready to land with &s;uch an Army as would be able to do his bu&s;ine&s;s. This had been di&s;per&s;ed by &s;ome who had been &s;ent Expre&s;&s;es into <HI>Flanders;</HI> who, though they allways lay conceal'd during the time they <MILESTONE N="20"> waited for their di&s;patches from the King, yet found &s;ome friends and acquaintance about the Court, or in their way, who thought they did the King good &s;ervice in making his Maje&s;ty be thought to be in a good condition; and &s;o fill'd tho&s;e People with &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, as would make them mo&s;t welcome when they return'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis had taken the full &s;urvey of all that was to be depended upon, he conjured the warmer People to be quiet, and not to think of any Action till they &s;hould be infallibly &s;ure of the King's being landed, and confirm'd the other in their warine&s;s; and being in|formed that <HI>Cromwell</HI> knew of his being there, and made many &s;earches <MILESTONE N="30"> for him, he thought it time to return. And &s;o about the time that the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis returns out of</HI> England.</NOTE> Parliament was di&s;&s;olv'd, he was conducted by D^r <HI>Quatermaine,</HI> the King's Phy&s;ician, through <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> and there embarked, and &s;afely tran&s;|ported into <HI>France;</HI> from whence he came into <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gave the Occa&s;ion to <HI>Cromwell</HI> to make that di&s;cour&s;e before mentioned to the Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> of the Lord Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s having been three weeks in the City; of which he had receiv'd perfect Intelligence from a hand that was not then in the lea&s;t degree &s;u&s;pected, nor was then wicked enough to put him into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hand; which he could ea&s;ily have done; of which more <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;hall be &s;aid hereafter. But when the Protector was well a&s;&s;ured that the Marquis was out of his reach, which vexed and grieved him ex|ceedingly, he cau&s;ed all Per&s;ons, who he knew had, or he thought <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>ap|prehends &s;eve|ral Per&s;ons.</HI></NOTE> might, have &s;poken with him, to be apprehended. All Pri&s;ons, as well in the Country as the City, were fill'd with tho&s;e who had been of the King's Party, or he believ'd would be; and he thought this a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ea&s;on to terrify his Enemies, of all conditions, within the Kingdom, with Spectacles which might mortify them.</P>
<P>IN the preparations which had been made towards an In&s;urrection, many Per&s;ons in the Country, as well as in the City, had receiv'd Com|mi&s;&s;ions <MILESTONE N="50"> for Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot; and, among&s;t the re&s;t, one M^r <HI>Stapley,</HI> a Gentleman of a good extraction, and a good fortune in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Stapley <HI>Engagement for the King.</HI></NOTE> the County of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> who&s;e Mother had been Si&s;ter to the Earl of

<HI>Norwich,</HI> but his Father had been in the Number of the blacke&s;t Of|fenders, and one of the King's Judges. This Son of his, who now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed his E&s;tate, had taken great pains to mingle in the Company of tho&s;e who were known to have affection for the King; and, upon all occa&s;ions, made profe&s;&s;ions of a de&s;ire, for the expiation of his Father's Crime, to venture his own life, and his fortune for his Maje&s;ty's Re|&s;toration; and not only his Fortune, but his Intere&s;t was con&s;iderable in that Maritime County: &s;o that many thought fit to cheri&s;h tho&s;e inclinations in him, and to encourage him to hope, that his fidelity might de&s;erve to enjoy that E&s;tate, which the trea&s;on of his Father had forfeited.</P>
<P>THERE was a young Gentleman, <HI>John Mordaunt,</HI> the younger Son, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Mordaunt <HI>is active for the King.</HI></NOTE> and Brother, of the Earls of <HI>Peterborough;</HI> who, having been too young to be engaged in the late War, during which time he had his education in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> was now of age, of parts, and great vi|gour of mind, and newly married to a young beautiful Lady of a very Loyal Spirit, and notable vivacity of Wit and Humour, who concurr'd with him in all honourable dedications of him&s;elf. He re&s;olv'd to em|brace all opportunities to &s;erve the King, and to di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e upon whom he had influence, to take the &s;ame re&s;olution; and being allied <MILESTONE N="20"> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> he did by him inform his Maje&s;ty of his re|&s;olution, and his readine&s;s to receive any commands from him.

<P>M^r STAPLEY was well known to M^r <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> who had repre|&s;ented his affections to the King, and how u&s;eful he might be towards the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome place in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and his undertaking that he would do &s;o, by a Letter to the King under M^r <HI>Stapley</HI>'s own hand: and thereupon M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> de&s;ired, that his Maje&s;ty would &s;end a Com|mi&s;&s;ion for the Command of a Regiment of Hor&s;e to him; which he would provide, and cau&s;e to be ready again&s;t the &s;ea&s;on he &s;hould be re|quired <MILESTONE N="30"> to appear: which Commi&s;&s;ion, with many others, was &s;ent to M^r <HI>Mordaunt;</HI> and he deliver'd it to M^r <HI>Stapley;</HI> who was exceedingly plea&s;ed with it, renew'd all his vowes and prote&s;tations; and it is &s;till believ'd that he really meant all he pretended. But he had tru&s;ted &s;ome Servant, who betray'd him; and being thereupon &s;ent for by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> his Father's fa&s;t old Friend, was by him &s;o cajoled by pro|mi&s;es and by threats, that he was not able to with&s;tand him; but be|lieving that he knew already all that he asked him, he conceal'd nothing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Stapley <HI>di&s;covers what he knew of the plot.</HI></NOTE> that he knew him&s;elf; inform'd him of tho&s;e of the &s;ame Country who were to joyn with him; of whom &s;ome had likewi&s;e receiv'd Com|mi&s;&s;ions, <MILESTONE N="40"> as well as him&s;elf; <Q>and in the end he confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that he had&endq; receiv'd his Commi&s;&s;ion from M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI>'s own hand.</Q> Before this di&s;covery M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> had been &s;ent for by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and very &s;trict|ly examin'd, whether he had &s;een the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> during his late being in <HI>London;</HI> which, though he had done often, he very con|fidently and po&s;itively denied, being well a&s;&s;ured that it could not be proved, and that the Marquis him&s;elf was in &s;afety: upon which con|fident denial, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to return to his own Lodging.

The&s;e <MILESTONE N="10"> three were totally unacquainted with each other; and though every one of them knew enough again&s;t him&s;elf, they could not accu&s;e one another, if they had been inclined to it. The fir&s;t and the la&s;t could not doubt but that there would be evidence enough again&s;t them; and they had found means to corre&s;pond &s;o much together, as to re&s;olve that neither of them would plead to the impeachment, but demur to the ju|ri&s;diction of the Court, and de&s;ire to have Council a&s;&s;ign'd to argue again&s;t it in point of Law; they being both &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed, how to urge Law enough to make it evident that neither of them could be legally tryed by that Court, and that it was erected contrary to Law. <MILESTONE N="20"> The fir&s;t that was brought to tryal, was M^r <HI>Mordaunt.</HI> After his Ar|raignment, by which he found that the delivery of the Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Stapley</HI> would be principally in&s;i&s;ted on, and which he knew might too ea&s;ily be proved, he, according to former re&s;olution, refu&s;ed to plead not-guilty; but in&s;i&s;ted, <Q>&startq;that by the Law of the Land he ought not&endq; to be tryed by that Court;</Q> <Q>for which he gave more rea&s;ons than they could an&s;wer; and then de&s;ired, &startq;that his Council might have liberty&endq; to argue the point in Law;</Q> <Q>which of cour&s;e u&s;ed to be granted in all legal Courts. But he was told, &startq;that he was better to bethink him&s;elf; that they were well &s;atisfied in the legality of their Court, and would <MILESTONE N="30"> not &s;uffer the juri&s;diction of it to be di&s;puted; that the Law of <HI>Eng|land</HI> had provided a Sentence for &s;uch ob&s;tinate Per&s;ons as refu&s;ed to be tryed by it; which was, that they &s;hould be condemned as mutes;&endq; which would be His Ca&s;e, if he continued refractory:</Q> &s;o he was car|ried back to the Tower, to con&s;ider better what he would do the next day. S^r <HI>Harry Slingsby</HI> was called next. He knowing nothing of, or for the other re&s;olution, pleaded not-guilty; and &s;o was &s;ent to the Pri&s;on to be tryed in his turn. D^r <HI>Hewet,</HI> who&s;e greate&s;t Crime was collect|ing and &s;ending Money to the King, be&s;ides having given Money to &s;ome Officers, refu&s;ed to plead, as M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> had done, and de|manded <MILESTONE N="40"> that his Council might be heard; and received the &s;ame an|&s;wer, and admonition, that the other had done; and was remitted again to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>THOSE Courts &s;eldom con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ewer than twenty Judges; a|mong&s;t whom, there were u&s;ually &s;ome, who, out of pity or for Money, were inclin'd to do good Offices to the Pri&s;oners who came before them; at lea&s;t to communicate &s;uch Secrets to them, as might inform them what would be mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t them.

<PB N="486" REF="4980">
other, &startq;that they had no &s;ufficient proof to condemn him upon any particular with which he &s;tood charged, but only for the delivery of the Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Stapley;</HI> and that there was to that point, be&s;ides <HI>Stapley,</HI> one Colonel <HI>Mallory,</HI> who&s;e te&s;timony was more valued than&endq; the other's.</Q> This <HI>Mallory</HI> had the reputation of an hone&s;t Man, and lov'd M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> very well, and was one of tho&s;e who were princi|pally tru&s;ted in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and had been apprehended about the &s;ame time that <HI>Stapley</HI> was; and finding, upon his fir&s;t Examina|tion, by the Que&s;tions admini&s;ter'd to him by <HI>Thurlow,</HI> that all was di&s;|cover'd, he unwarily confe&s;&s;ed all that he knew concerning M^r <HI>Mor|daunt;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> having been him&s;elf the Per&s;on principally employed between him and <HI>Stapley.</HI> He was brought in Cu&s;tody from the Tower, to give in Evidence again&s;t M^r <HI>Mardaunt,</HI> with an intention in the Court, af|ter he had done that good Service, to proceed as &s;trictly again&s;t him&s;elf, though they promi&s;ed him indemnity.</P>
<P>THE Lady, having clear information of this whole matter, could not find any way that night to adverti&s;e her Husband, that he &s;hould no more in&s;i&s;t upon the want of Juri&s;diction in the Court. For there was no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;peaking with, or &s;ending to him, during the time of his Tryal. Therefore &s;he laid a&s;ide the thought of that bu&s;ine&s;s till <MILESTONE N="20"> the morning, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in contriving how <HI>Mallory</HI> might be prevailed with to make an E&s;cape; and was &s;o dextrous, and &s;o fortu|nate, that a friend of hers di&s;po&s;ed the Money &s;he gave him &s;o effectually, that the next morning, when <HI>Mallory</HI> was brought to the Hall to be ready to give in his Evidence, he found &s;ome means to withdraw from his Guard, and when he was in the Croud he ea&s;ily got away.</P>
<P>SHE had as good fortune likewi&s;e to have a little Note &s;he writ con|cerning the other Advice, put into her Husband's hand, as he pa&s;&s;ed to the Bar; which having peru&s;ed, he departed from his former re&s;olution; and after he had mode&s;tly urged the &s;ame again which he had done the <MILESTONE N="30"> day before, to &s;pend time, and the Pre&s;ident, in much choler, an&s;wer|ing as he had done, he &s;ubmitted to his Tryal; and behaved him&s;elf with courage; and ea&s;ily evaded the greate&s;t part of the Evidence they had again&s;t him; nor could they find proof, what pre&s;umption &s;oever there might be, that he had &s;poken with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> and he evaded many other particulars of his corre&s;pondence with the King, with notable Addre&s;s. That of the Commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Stapley</HI> was re&s;erv'd to the la&s;t; and the Commi&s;&s;ion being produced, and both the hand and the &s;ignet generally known, by rea&s;on of &s;o many of the like, which had fallen into their hands at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and by many other Accidents, M^r <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Stapley</HI> was called to declare where he had it; and &s;eeing him&s;elf con|fronted by M^r <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> though he did, after many que&s;tions and re|proaches from the Council that pro&s;ecuted, at la&s;t confe&s;s that he did re|ceive it from M^r <HI>Mordaunt;</HI> yet he did it in &s;o di&s;orderly and confu&s;ed a manner, that it appear'd he had much rather not have &s;aid it; and an|&s;wer'd the Que&s;tions M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> asked him with that confu&s;ion, that his Evidence could not be &s;atisfactory to any impartial Judges. Then <HI>Mallory</HI> was called for; but by no &s;earch could be &s;ound; and they could not, by their own rules, defer their Sentence. And it &s;o fell out by one of the Judge's withdrawing upon a &s;uddain fit of the Stone, that the Court <MILESTONE N="50"> was divided, one half for the condemning him, and the other half that he was not guilty; whereupon the determination depended upon the &s;ingle Vote of the Pre&s;ident; who made &s;ome excu&s;es for the Ju&s;tice he was
<PB N="487" REF="4990">
about to do, and acknowledged many obligations to the Mother of the Pri&s;oner, and, in contemplation thereof, pronounced him Innocent for ought appear'd to the Court. There was not in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time the like In&s;tance; and &s;carce any other Man e&s;caped the judgement, that was tryed before any high Court of Ju&s;tice. And he was &s;o offended at it, that, contrary to all the forms u&s;ed by them&s;elves, he cau&s;ed him to be kept for &s;ome Months after in the Tower, and would willingly have brought him to be tryed again. For, within a day or two after, <HI>Mallory</HI> was retaken, and they had likewi&s;e corrupted a <HI>French-</HI>man, who had <MILESTONE N="10"> long &s;erv'd him, and was the only Servant whom he had made choice of (&s;ince he was to be allow'd but one) to attend him in the Pri&s;on: and he had di&s;cover'd enough to have taken away his Life &s;everal ways. But the &s;candal was &s;o great, and the Ca&s;e &s;o unheard of, that any Man, di&s;charg'd upon a publick Tryal, &s;hould be again proceeded again&s;t upon new Evi|dence for the &s;ame offence, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf thought not fit to un|dergo the Reproach of it, but was in the end prevail'd with to &s;et him at liberty. And he was very few days at liberty, before he embarked him&s;elf as frankly in the King's Service as before, and with better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Harry Slingsby,</HI> and poor D^r <HI>Hewet</HI> had wor&s;e fortune; and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> H.

<P>SIR <HI>Harry Slingsby,</HI> as is &s;aid before, was in the fir&s;t Rank of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of S^r</HI> Harry Slingsby.</NOTE> Gentlemen of <HI>York-&s;hire;</HI> and was return'd to &s;erve as a Member in the Parliament that continued &s;o many years; where he &s;ate till the Troubles begun; and having no relation to, or dependence upon the Court, he was &s;wayed only by his Con&s;cience to dete&s;t the violent and undutiful beha|viour of that Parliament. He was a Gentleman of a good under&s;tanding, but of a very melancholick nature, and of very few words: and when he <MILESTONE N="50"> could &s;tay no longer with a good Con&s;cience in their Councils, in which he never concurr'd, he went into his Country, and joyn'd with the fir&s;t who took up Armes for the King.

the Crown in any other attempt. And having a good fortune and a ge|neral reputation, had a greater Influence upon the People, than They who talked more and louder; and was known to be irreconcilable to the new Government; and therefore was cut off, notwith&s;tanding very great interce&s;&s;ion to pre&s;erve him. For he was Uncle to the Lord <HI>Fal|conbridge;</HI> who engaged his Wife and all his new Allies to intercede for him, without effect. When he was brought to die, he &s;pent very little time in di&s;cour&s;e; <Q>but told them, &startq;he was to die for being an hone&s;t&endq; Man, of which he was very glad.</Q></P>
<P>D^r HEWET was born a Gentleman, and bred a Scholar, and was a <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And of D^r</HI> Hewet</NOTE> Divine before the beginning of the Troubles.

When the Lord <HI>Falconbridge</HI> married <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s daughter (who had u&s;ed &s;ecretly to frequent his Church) after the ceremony of the time, He was made choice of to marry them according to the order of the Church; which engaged both that Lord and Lady, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t credit with the Protector to pre&s;erve his Life; but he was inexorable, and de&s;irous that the Church|men, <MILESTONE N="20"> upon whom he looked as his mortal enemies, &s;hould &s;ee what they were to tru&s;t to, if they &s;tood in need of his Mercy.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;To this Undertaking, though too great for Us, We are apt to think our &s;elves &s;o much the more &s;trongly engaged, by how much the more We are &s;en&s;ible, that as our Sins have been the greate&s;t cau&s;es, &s;o our many follies and imprudences have not been the lea&s;t means of giving both birth and growth to tho&s;e many mi&s;eries, and calamities, which We, together with three once mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Kingdoms, do at this&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> day &s;adly groan under.</Q></P>

<PB N="496" REF="5080">
of wi&s;e Men, <HI>viz.</HI> that Liberty, Religion, and Reformation, the wonted Engines of Politicians, are but deceitful baits, by which the ea&s;ily deluded Multitude are tempted to a greedy pur&s;uit of their own ruin. In the unhappy number of the&s;e Fools, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;elf to have been one; who have nothing more now to boa&s;t of, but only that, as I was not the fir&s;t was cheated, &s;o I was not the la&s;t was undeceiv'd; having long &s;ince, by peeping a little (now and then, as I had opportu|nity) under the vizzard of the Impo&s;tor, got &s;uch glimp&s;es, though but imperfect ones, of his ugly face, conceal'd under the painted pretences of Sanctity, as made me conclude, that the &s;eries of Affairs, and the re|volution <MILESTONE N="10"> of a few years, would convince this blinded Generation of their Errors; and make them affrightedly to &s;tart from Him, as a prodigious piece of deformity, whom they adored and reverenced as the beauti|ful&endq; Image of a Deity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;NOR did this my expectation fail me: God, who glories in no Attri|bute more than to be acknowledged the Searcher of the inward parts, could no longer endure the bold Affronts of this audacious Hypocrite; but, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and confu&s;ion of all his Idolatrous wor&s;hippers, has, by the un&s;earchable wi&s;dom of his deep laid Coun&s;els, lighted &s;uch a Candle into the dark Dungeon of his Soul, that there is none &s;o blind <MILESTONE N="20"> who does not plainly read Treachery, Tyranny, Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, Di&s;&s;imu|lation, Athei&s;m, Hypocri&s;y, and all manner of Villany, written in large Characters on his heart; nor is there any one remaining, who dares open his mouth in ju&s;tification of him, for fear of incurring the de&s;erved Character of being a profe&s;&s;ed Advocate for all wickedne&s;s, and a &s;worn&endq; Enemy to all Virtue.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THIS was no &s;ooner brought forth, but pre&s;ently I conceived hopes of being able, in a &s;hort time, to put in practice tho&s;e thoughts of Loyal|ty to your Maje&s;ty, which had long had entertainment in my brea&s;t, but till now were forced to &s;eek concealment under a &s;eeming conformity to <MILESTONE N="30"> the iniquity of the Times. A fit opportunity of giving birth to the&s;e de|&s;igns,&endq; was happily admini&s;ter'd by the following occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;GREAT was the rage, and ju&s;t the indignation of the People, when they fir&s;t found the Authority of their Parliament &s;wallow'd up in the new Name of a Protector; greater was their fury, and upon better grounds, when they ob&s;erved that, under the &s;ilent, mode&s;t, and flatter|ing Title of this Protector, was &s;ecretly a&s;&s;umed a Power more ab&s;olute, more arbitrary, more unlimited, than ever was pretended to by any King. The Pulpits &s;treightways &s;ound with Declamations, the Streets are fill'd with Pa&s;quils and Libels, every one expre&s;&s;es a dete&s;tation of <MILESTONE N="40"> this Innovation by publick Invectives, and all the Nation, with one ac|cord, &s;eems at once to be in&s;pired with one and the &s;ame re&s;olution of endeavouring valiantly to redeem that Liberty, by armes and force,&endq; which was treacherou&s;ly &s;toln from them by deceit and fraud.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;WHEN they had for a while exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in tumultuary di&s;|cour&s;es (the fir&s;t effects of Popular di&s;contents) at length they begin to contrive by what means to free them&s;elves from the yoke that is upon them. In order hereunto, &s;everal of the chiefe&s;t of the Male|contents enter into con&s;ultations among&s;t them&s;elves; to which they were plea&s;ed to invite and admit Me. Being taken into their Coun|cils, <MILESTONE N="50"> and made privy to their Debates, I thought it my work to ac|quaint my &s;elf fully with the tempers, inclinations, di&s;po&s;itions, and principles of them; which (though all meeting and concentring in an irreconcilable hatred and animo&s;ity again&s;t the u&s;urper) I find &s;o va|rious

in their ends, and &s;o contrary in the means conducing to tho&s;e ends, that they do naturally fall under the di&s;tinction of different Par|ties.

Having proceeded thus far, and gained as many of the chief of them, <MILESTONE N="20"> whom I knew to be Leaders of the re&s;t, as could &s;afely be intru&s;ted with a bu&s;ine&s;s of this nature (the &s;ucce&s;s whereof does principally de|pend upon the &s;ecret management of it) I thought I had nothing more now to $o$ but only to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h them, as well as I could, in their infa$$ Allegiance, by engaging them &s;o far in an humble Addre&s;s unto your Maje&s;ty, that they might not know how to make either a&endq; &s;a$e or honourable Retreat.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I mu&s;t leave it to the Ingenuity of this worthy Gentleman, by who&s;e hands it is convey'd, to make an&s;wer to any &s;uch objections as may per|haps be made by your Maje&s;ty, either as to the matter or manner of it. <MILESTONE N="30"> This only I would put your Maje&s;ty in mind of, that they are but young Pro&s;elytes, and are to be driven <HI>lento pede,</HI> le&s;t, being urged at fir&s;t too&endq; violently, they &s;hould re&s;i&s;t the more refractorily.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;AS to the Quality of the Per&s;ons, I cannot &s;ay they are either of great Families, or great E&s;tates. But this I am confident of, that, whether it be by their own virtue, or by the misfortune of the times, I will not de|termine, they are &s;uch who may be more &s;erviceable to your Maje&s;ty in this conjuncture, than tho&s;e who&s;e Names &s;well much bigger than Theirs with the Addition of great Titles.

<P><Q>&startq;WHAT more is expedient to be done by your Maje&s;ty, in order to the encouragement and &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e Gentlemen who already are, or hereafter may be, brought over to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of your Maje&s;ty's Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t, I &s;hall commit to the care of this honourable Per&s;on; who being no &s;tranger to the complection, and con&s;titution of tho&s;e with whom I have to deal, is able &s;ufficiently to inform your Maje&s;ty by what <MILESTONE N="10"> ways and means they may be laid under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to your&endq; Maje&s;ty's Service.</Q></P>

<P>THE King believ'd that the&s;e di&s;tempers might, in &s;ome conjuncture, be of u&s;e to him; and therefore return'd the general An&s;wer that is men|tioned <MILESTONE N="20"> before; <Q>and &startq;that he would be willing to confer with &s;ome Per|&s;ons&endq; of that Party, tru&s;ted by the re&s;t, if they would come over to him;</Q> his Maje&s;ty being then at <HI>Bruges:</HI> upon which that young Gentleman came over thither to him, and remain'd &s;ome days there conceal'd. He was a Per&s;on of very extraordinary parts, &s;harpne&s;s of Wit, readine&s;s and volubility of Tongue, but an Anabapti&s;t. He had been bred in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and afterwards in the Inns of Court; but being too young to have known the Religion, or the Government of the precedent time, and his Father having been engaged from the be|ginning again&s;t the King, he had &s;ucked in the opinions that were mo&s;t <MILESTONE N="30"> prevalent, and had been a Soldier in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Life Guard of Hor&s;e, when he was thought to be mo&s;t re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h a Republick. But when that Mask was pulled off, he dete&s;ted him with that rage, that he was of the combination with tho&s;e who re&s;olved to de&s;troy him by what way &s;oever; and was very intimate with <HI>Syndercome.</HI> He had a great confidence of the &s;trength and power of that Party; and confe&s;&s;ed that their demands were extravagant, and &s;uch as the King could not grant; which, after they were once engaged in blood, he doubted not they would recede from, by the credit the Wi&s;er Men had amon&s;t them. He return'd into <HI>England</HI> very well &s;atisfied with the King; and did afterwards cor|re&s;pond <MILESTONE N="40"> very faithfully with his profe&s;&s;ions; but left the King without any hope of other benefit from that Party, than by their encrea&s;ing the faction and animo&s;ity again&s;t <HI>Cromwell:</HI> for it was manife&s;t they expected a good Sun of pre&s;ent Money from the King; which could not be in his power to &s;upply.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, the King found every day, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o much de&s;paired of his Cau&s;e, that they had no mind to give him any A&s;&s;i&s;tance with which he might make an attempt upon <HI>Eng|land;</HI> and that, if they had been never &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, they were not able to do it: and therefore he re&s;olv'd that he would not, in a Country that was <MILESTONE N="50"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King &s;ent to</HI> Don Juan <Q><HI>&startq;that $e would ac|company him into the&endq; $Span$</HI></Q></NOTE> &s;o great a Scene of War, live unactive and unconcern'd: &s;o his Maje&s;ty &s;ent to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> <Q>&startq;that he would accompany him in the Field the next Cam|pagne,&endq; without expecting any Ceremony, or putting him to any trouble.</Q> But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ent him a formal Me&s;&s;age, and employed the Earl of

<P>HIS Maje&s;ty was no &s;ooner come thither, but <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> renew'd his advices, and importunity, that he would make a conjunction with the Levellers.

<P>WITHIN three or four days after his return, the <HI>French</HI> Army ap|pear'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunkirk <HI>be|&s;ieged by the</HI> French <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> before <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and then the <HI>Spaniard</HI> believ'd it; and made what ha&s;t they could to draw their Army together, which was very much di&s;per&s;ed, &s;o that, before they were upon their march, the <HI>French</HI> had perfected their Circumvallation, and render'd it impo&s;&s;ible to put any Succours into the Town. Now they &s;ound it nece&s;&s;ary indeed to hazard a Battle, which they had promi&s;ed to do, when they intended nothing le&s;s.

declare what the other would do: <Q>as the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> when the Ar|mies march'd near, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not alter their formal lazy pace, nor their re&s;t at noon, would in choler tell them, &startq;if we do not make&endq; great ha&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a Pa&s;s (which they never thought of)</Q> <Q>&startq;Mar&s;hal&endq; <HI>Turenne</HI> will take it, though it be much farther from him;</Q> and would then, when they con&s;ider'd not what he &s;aid, advance with his own Troops to po&s;&s;e&s;s the place, even when the <HI>French</HI> were come in view; and by &s;uch &s;ea&s;onable fore&s;ights &s;aved the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army from many di&s;tre&s;&s;es.

Mar&s;hal <HI>Turenne,</HI> accompa|nied with the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who would never be ab&s;ent upon tho&s;e occa|&s;ions, and &s;ome of the principal Officers, &s;pent two or three days in view|ing <MILESTONE N="20"> the Line round, and ob&s;erving and informing him&s;elf of all that was to be known, and riding &s;o near the Line very frequently, that &s;ome of his Company were kill'd within much le&s;s than Mu&s;quet &s;hot. <Q>In the end, he called &s;ome of the principal Officers, and &s;aid, &startq;he would, that&endq; day at noon, a&s;&s;ault the Line, at a place which he &s;hew'd to them;</Q> <Q>which the Officers wonder'd at; and &s;aid, &startq;it was the &s;tronge&s;t part of the Line; and that they had ob&s;erv'd to him, that the whole Line on the other&endq; &s;ide was very much weaker;</Q> <Q>to which the Mar&s;hal replied, &startq;you do not know who keeps that Line; We &s;hall do no good there; <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Prince</HI> never &s;leeps, and that is His Po&s;t; but I will tell you, what&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> will fall out on the other &s;ide;</Q> for he had him&s;elf marched in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army, and very well under&s;tood the Cu&s;toms of it. <Q>He told them then, &startq;that it would be very long, before the Soldiers upon the Line, or the adjacent Guard, would believe that the <HI>French</HI> were in earne&s;t, and that they would in truth at that time of day a&s;&s;ault them; but would think, that they meant only to give them an Alarm, which they were never warm in receiving: that when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were convinced that the <HI>French</HI> were in earne&s;t, in which time he &s;hould be got near their Line, they would &s;end to the Count of <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna,</HI> who at that time of day was u&s;ually a&s;leep, and his Servants would not be per&s;waded to <MILESTONE N="40"> waken him in a Moment: He would then &s;end for his Hor&s;e, and ride up to the Line; which when he &s;aw, he would with &s;ome ha&s;t repair to the Arch-Duke's Tent; who was likewi&s;e at his <HI>Sie&s;to,</HI> and when He&endq; was awake, they would con&s;ult what was to be done;</Q> <Q>by which time, the Mar&s;hal &s;aid, &startq;&endq;They &s;hould have done:</Q> And they did enter the Line accordingly, and found by the Pri&s;oners, that every thing had fallen out as he had foretold. So the Siege was rai&s;ed, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fled without making any re&s;i&s;tance, left their Cannon, Bag and Baggage, behind them: only the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> was in &s;o good order upon the fir&s;t Alarm, that when he heard of the confu&s;ion they were in, he drew off with his Can|non, <MILESTONE N="50"> and lo&s;t nothing that belonged to him, and marched with all his Men to a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the advice which the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Dunkirk</NOTE> given, <HI>Don Juan</HI> was po&s;itive in his fir&s;t Re&s;olution. The Prince, not without great indignation, con&s;ented; and drew up his Troops in the
<PB N="502" REF="5140">
place they de&s;ired; and quickly &s;aw all come to pa&s;s that he had foretold. The Country was mo&s;t inclo&s;ed, &s;o that the Hor&s;e could not fight but in &s;mall Bodies. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot under <HI>Lockhart</HI> charged the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Foot, and, after a good re&s;i&s;tance, broke and routed them; after which there was not much more re&s;i&s;tance on that &s;ide, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e doing no better than their Foot. Our King's Foot were placed by them&s;elves upon a little ri&s;ing ground, and were charged by the <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Foot were beaten. Some of them, and the greater part, march'd off by the favour of the Inclo&s;ures, there not being above two hundred taken Pri&s;oners. The Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> charged &s;everal times <MILESTONE N="10"> on Hor&s;e-back; and in the end, having gotten &s;ome Troops to go with them, charged the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (whom, though Enemies, they were glad to &s;ee behave them&s;elves &s;o well) and with great difficulty, and &s;ome blows of Mu&s;quets, got &s;afe off. But there was a rumour &s;pread in the <HI>French</HI> Ar|my, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ome Men undertaking to &s;ay that they &s;aw him in their hands: whereupon many of the <HI>French</HI> Officers, and Gentlemen, re&s;olv'd to &s;et him at Liberty, and rode up to the Body of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and look'd upon all their Pri&s;oners, and found they were mi&s;inform'd; which if they had not been, they would undoubtedly, at any hazard or danger, have enlarged him; &s;o great an af|fection <MILESTONE N="20"> that Nation own'd to have for his Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE day being thus lo&s;t with a greater Rout and Confu&s;ion than lo&s;s of Men, <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> who behaved them|&s;elves in their own Per&s;ons with courage enough, were contented to think better of the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI>'s advice, by which they pre&s;erv'd the be&s;t part of the Army, and retired to <HI>Ipres</HI> and <HI>Furnes,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Don Juan <HI>af|ter the lo&s;s of the Battle re|tires to</HI> Ipres.</NOTE> to <HI>Newport,</HI> that they might defend the re&s;t when <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be taken; which was the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s of Mar&s;hal <HI>Turenne;</HI> who found the Marquis <HI>de Leyde</HI> re&s;olv'd to defend it, notwith&s;tanding the defeat of the Army: and therefore he betook him&s;elf again to that work, a&s;&s;oon as <MILESTONE N="30"> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army was retired into fa&s;tne&s;s. The Marquis <HI>de Leyde,</HI> when <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis</HI> de Leyde <HI>&s;al|lus upon the Enemy; is re|pul&s;ed, and &s;lain.</HI></NOTE> he &s;aw there was no more hope of relief from <HI>Don Juan,</HI> which whil&s;t he expected, he was wary in the hazard of his Men, was now re&s;olv'd to try what he could do for him&s;elf: &s;o with as &s;trong a Party as he could make, he made a de&s;perate Sally upon the Enemy; who, though he di&s;order'd them, were quickly &s;o &s;econded, that they drove him back into the Town with great lo&s;s, after him&s;elf had receiv'd a wound, of which he died with|in three days after. And then the Officers &s;ent to treat, which he would not con&s;ent to whil&s;t he liv'd. The Marquis was a much greater lo&s;s than the Town; which the Ma&s;ter of the Field may be allways Ma&s;ter of in two <MILESTONE N="40"> Months time at mo&s;t. But in truth the death of the Marquis was an irre|parable damage, he being a very wi&s;e Man, of great experience, great wi&s;dom, and great piety, after his way; in&s;omuch as he had an Intention to have taken Orders in the Church; to which he was mo&s;t devoted.</P>
<P>THOSE in the Town had fair conditions to march to S^t <HI>Omers,</HI> that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Town of</HI> Dunkirk <HI>&s;ur|render'd, and the</HI> French <HI>King delivers it to the</HI> Eng|li&s;h</NOTE> they might not joyn with the Reliques of their Army. The <HI>French</HI> King being by this time come to the Camp with the Cardinal, enter'd the Town, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it him&s;elf; which a&s;&s;oon as he had done, he deli|ver'd it into the hands of <HI>Lockhart,</HI> whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> had made Governour of it. Thus the Treaty was perform'd between them; and that King went <MILESTONE N="50"> pre&s;ently to <HI>Calais,</HI> and from thence &s;ent the Duke of <HI>Crequy</HI> together with <HI>Mancini,</HI> Nephew to the Cardinal, to <HI>London</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who likewi&s;e &s;ent his Son in Law, the Lord <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> to congratulate with that King for their joynt pro&s;perity. And mutual

profe&s;&s;ions were then renewed between them, <Q>with new obligations &startq;ne|ver&endq; to make Peace without each other's con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Don Juan</HI> had fir&s;t remov'd from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and the Army marched into the field, the King had renew'd his de&s;ire that he might likewi&s;e go with them, but was refu&s;ed with the &s;ame po&s;itivene&s;s he had been before. His Maje&s;ty thereupon re&s;olved that he would not &s;tay alone in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> whil&s;t all the world was in Action; but thought of &s;ome more private place, where he might take the Summer Air, and refre&s;h him|&s;elf during that &s;ea&s;on. He was the more confirm'd in this upon the News <MILESTONE N="10"> of the defeat of the Army near <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the lo&s;s of that place. So he remov'd to a Village call'd <HI>Hoch&s;traten;</HI> where there were very good Hou&s;es, capable to have receiv'd a greater Train than belong'd to His <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|tires to</HI> Hoch|&s;traten <HI>in</HI> Aug</NOTE> Court. Thither the King went about the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> the village lving upon the skirts of the States Dominions in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and within five or &s;ix miles of <HI>Breda,</HI> &s;ometimes he made journies, <HI>incognito,</HI> to &s;ee places where he not been before.</P>
<P>THERE a Man might have ob&s;erv'd the great difference of the con|dition, which the Subjects in the States Dominions, even in the &s;ight and view of the other, enjoy above what their Neighbours of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ter|ritories <MILESTONE N="20"> are acquainted with. <HI>Hoch&s;traten</HI> is an open Village, belonging to the Count of that name, and hath enjoy'd very ample Privileges, the Owner thereof being one of the greate&s;t Nobles in the Duchy of <HI>Brabant.</HI> It is plea&s;antly &s;eated, many very good Hou&s;es, and the Mannor large of Extent, and of great Revenue.

But there appear'd po|verty <MILESTONE N="30"> in the faces and looks of the People, good grounds without any &s;tock, and, in a word, nothing that looked well but the Hou&s;es, and tho&s;e empty within: on the other &s;ide of a Line that is drawn (for a Man may &s;et one foot in the Dominion that is re&s;erved to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the other in that which is a&s;&s;ign'd to the <HI>Hollander)</HI> the Hou&s;es, though not &s;tand|ing &s;o thick, nor &s;o beautiful without, clean, neat; and well furni&s;h'd within; very good Linen, and &s;ome plate in every Hou&s;e; the People jolly, well cloathed, and with looks very well plea&s;ed; all the Grounds and Land fully &s;tocked with all kind of Cattle, and, as if it were the Land of <HI>Go&s;hen,</HI> the appearance of nothing but wealth, and fertility, encom|pa&s;&s;ed <MILESTONE N="40"> with extreme barrenne&s;s, and unconceivable Poverty. And they on the <HI>Holland</HI> &s;ide, that lies equally open, and undefended, can &s;ee the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops exerci&s;e all Licence upon their poor Neighbours of <HI>Hoch|&s;traten;</HI> and yet the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute among them dare not &s;tep into Their Quarters to take a Hen, or commit the lea&s;t tre&s;pa&s;s: &s;o &s;trickly the Ar|ticles of the Peace are ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>WHILST the King &s;pent his time in this manner, about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who remained &s;till with the Troops at <HI>Newport</HI> to defend that place, as <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the re&s;t, remained about <HI>Furnes</HI> and <HI>Bruges,</HI> &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the King to let him know, <Q>&startq;that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King has notice that</HI> Cromwell <HI>was dead.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> the Letters from <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers, reported confident|ly&endq; that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was dead;</Q> which, there having been no News of his &s;ickne&s;s, was not at fir&s;t ea&s;ily believed.

<P>IT is very true, he knew of many combinations to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, by tho&s;e who, he believed, wi&s;h'd the King no good. And a good while before this, when he had di&s;cover'd the de&s;ign of <HI>Syndercome,</HI> who was a very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Syndercome<HI>'s de&s;ign again&s;t him a good while before this.</HI></NOTE> &s;tout Man, and one who had been much in his favour, and who had twice or thrice, by wonderful and unexpected Accidents, been di&s;appointed in the minute he made &s;ure to kill him, and had cau&s;ed him to be appre|hended, his behaviour was &s;o re&s;olute in his Examination and Trial, as if he thought he &s;hould &s;till be able to do it; and it was manife&s;t that he <MILESTONE N="30"> had many more A&s;&s;ociates, who were undi&s;cover'd and as re&s;olute as him|&s;elf; and though he had got him condemn'd to die, the Fellow's carriage and words were &s;uch, as if he knew well how to avoid the Judgement; which made <HI>Cromwell</HI> believe, that a Party in the Army would attempt his re&s;cue; <Q>whereupon he gave &s;trict charge, &startq;that he &s;hould be carefully looked to in the Tower, and three or four of the Guard allways with&endq; him day and night.</Q></P>
<P>AT the day appointed for his Execution, tho&s;e Troops <HI>Cromwell</HI> was mo&s;t confident of, were placed upon the Tower Hill, where the Gallowes were erected. But when the Guard call'd <HI>Syndercome</HI> to ari&s;e in the mor|ning, <MILESTONE N="40"> they found him dead in his bed; which gave trouble exceedingly to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> for be&s;ides that he hoped, that, at his death, to avoid the ut|mo&s;t rigour of it, he would have confe&s;&s;ed many of his Con&s;ederates, he now found him&s;elf under the reproach of having cau&s;ed him to be poy|&s;oned, as not daring to bring him to publick Ju&s;tice: nor could he &s;uppre&s;s that Scandal. It appear'd upon Examination, that the night before, when he was going to bed in the pre&s;ence of his Guard, his Si&s;ter came to take her leave of him; <Q>and upon her going away, he put off his Cloaths, and leaped into his Bed, and &s;aid, &startq;&endq;this was the la&s;t Bed he &s;hould ever go into.</Q> His Body was drawn by a Hor&s;e to the Gallowes where he &s;hould have hanged, <MILESTONE N="50"> and buried under it, with a Stake driven through him, as is u&s;ual in the Ca&s;e of &s;elf Murtherers: yet this Accident perplexed <HI>Cromwell</HI> very much; and though he was without the particular di&s;covery which he expected, he made a general di&s;covery by it, that he him&s;elf was more odious in his Army than he believed he had been.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="5170">
HE &s;eem'd to be much afflicted at the death of his friend the Earl of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of the Earl of</HI> Warwick, <HI>and of the Earl's Grand&s;on.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Warwick;</HI> with whom he had a fa&s;t friend&s;hip; though neither their humours, nor their natures, were like. And the Heir of that Hou&s;e, who had married his younge&s;t Daughter, died about the &s;ame time; &s;o that all his relation to, or confidence in that Family was at an end; the other Branches of it abhorring his Alliance. His Dome&s;tic delights were le&s;&s;en'd every day: he plainly di&s;cover'd that his Son <HI>Falconbridge</HI>'s heart was &s;et upon an Intere&s;t de&s;tructive to his, and grew to hate him perfectly. But that which chiefly broke his peace, was the death of his Daughter <HI>Claypole;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s Daughter</HI> Claypole</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> who had been allways his greate&s;t joy, and who, in her &s;ickne&s;s, which was of a nature the Phy&s;icians knew not how to deal with, had &s;everal con|ferences with him, which exceedingly perplexed him. Though no body was near enough to hear the particulars, yet her often mentioning, in the pains &s;he endured, the blood her Father had &s;pilt, made People conclude, that &s;he had pre&s;ented his wor&s;t Actions to his con&s;ideration. And though he never made the lea&s;t &s;hew of remor&s;e for any of tho&s;e Actions, it is very certain, that either what &s;he &s;aid, or her death, affected him wonder|fully.</P>
<P>WHATEVER it was, about the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> he was &s;ei&s;ed on by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>&s;ei&s;ed on by an Ague in</HI> Au|gu&s;t</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> a common tertian Ague, from which, he believed, a little ea&s;e and di|verti&s;ement at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court would have freed him. But the fits grew &s;tronger, and his Spirits much abated: &s;o that he return'd again to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> when his Phy&s;icians began to think him in danger, though the Preachers, who prayed allways about him, and told God Almighty what great things he had done for him, and how much more need he had &s;till of his &s;ervice, declared as from God, that he &s;hould recover: and he him|&s;elf was of the &s;ame mind, and did not think he &s;hould die, till even the time that his Spirits fail'd him. <Q>Then he declared to them, &startq;that he&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He appoints his Son</HI> Ri|chard <HI>his Suc|ce&s;&s;or; and ex|pires,</HI> Sept. 3.</NOTE> did appoint his Son to &s;ucceed him,</Q> his elde&s;t Son <HI>Richard;</HI> and &s;o ex|pired <MILESTONE N="30"> upon the third day of <HI>September</HI> 1658, a day he thought all|ways very propitious to him, and on which he had twice triumphed for two of his greate&s;t Victories. And this now was a day very memorable for the greate&s;t Storm of Wind that had been ever known, for &s;ome hours <NOTE PLACE="marg">The terrible Storm on the &s;ame day</NOTE> before and after his death, which overthrew Trees, Hou&s;es, and made great Wrecks at Sea; and the tempe&s;t was &s;o univer&s;al, that the effects of it were terrible both in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> where all People trembled at it; for be&s;ides the Wrecks all along the Sea-Coa&s;t, many boats were ca&s;t away in the very Rivers; and within few days after, the circum&s;tance of his death, that accompanied that Storm, was univer&s;ally known.</P>
<P>HE was one of tho&s;e Men, <HI>quos vituperare ne inimici quidem po&s;|&s;unt,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Chara|cter</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>ni&s;i ut &s;imul laudent;</HI> whom his very Enemies could not condemn without commending him at the &s;ame time: for he could never have done half that mi&s;chief without great parts of Courage, Indu&s;try, and Judgement. He mu&s;t have had a wonderful under&s;tanding in the Na|tures and Humours of Men, and as great a dexterity in applying them; who, from a private and ob&s;cure birth (though of a good Family) with|out Intere&s;t or E&s;tate, Alliance or Friend&s;hip, could rai&s;e him&s;elf to &s;uch a heighth, and compound and knead &s;uch oppo&s;ite and contradicto|ry tempers, humours, and intere&s;ts into a con&s;i&s;tence, that contributed <MILESTONE N="50"> to His de&s;igns, and to their own de&s;truction; whil&s;t him&s;elf grew in|&s;en&s;ibly powerful enough to cut off tho&s;e by whom he had climbed, in the in&s;tant that they projected to demoli&s;h their own building.

Without doubt, no Man with more wickedne&s;s ever at|tempted any thing, or brought to pa&s;s what he de&s;ired more wicked|ly, more in the face and contempt of Religion, and moral Hone&s;ty; yet wickedne&s;s as great as his could never have accompli&s;h'd tho&s;e de|&s;igns, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a great Spirit, an admirable circum|&s;pection, and &s;agacity, and a mo&s;t magnanimous re&s;olution.</P>
<P>WHEN he appeared fir&s;t in the Parliament, he &s;eemed to have a <MILESTONE N="10"> Per&s;on in no degree gracious, no ornament of di&s;cour&s;e, none of tho&s;e Talents which u&s;e to conciliate the Affections of the Stander by: yet as he grew into Place and Authority, his parts &s;eem'd to be rai&s;ed, as if he had had concealed Faculties, till he had occa&s;ion to u&s;e them; and when he was to act the part of a great Man, he did it without any in|decency, notwith&s;tanding the want of Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>AFTER he was confirm'd, and inve&s;ted Protector by the humble <HI>Petition and Advice,</HI> he con&s;ulted with very few upon any Action of importance, nor communicated any enterpri&s;e he re&s;olved upon, with more than tho&s;e who were to have principal parts in the execu|cution <MILESTONE N="20"> of it; nor with Them &s;ooner than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. What he once re&s;olved, in which he was not ra&s;h, he would not be di&s;&s;waded from, nor endure any contradiction of his power and authority; but extorted obedience from them who were not willing to yield it.</P>
<P>ONE time, when he had laid &s;ome very extraordinary Tax upon the City, one <HI>Cony,</HI> an eminent Fanatick, and one who had hereto|fore &s;erved him very notably, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to pay his part; and loudly di&s;&s;waded others from &s;ubmitting to it, <Q>&startq;as an impo&s;ition no|toriou&s;ly again&s;t the Law, and the Property of the Subject, which&endq; all hone&s;t Men were bound to defend.</Q> <Q><HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ent for him, and <MILESTONE N="30"> cajoled him with the memory of &startq;the old kindne&s;s, and friend&s;hip, that had been between them; and that of all Men he did not expect this oppo&s;ition from Him, in a matter that was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the&endq; good of the Common-wealth.</Q> It had been allways his fortune to meet with the mo&s;t rude, and ob&s;tinate behaviour from tho&s;e who had formerly been ab&s;olutely govern'd by him; and they commonly put him in mind of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions and &s;ayings of his own, in ca&s;es of the like nature: &s;o this Man remember'd him, how great an Enemy he had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uch grievances, and had declared, <Q>&startq;that all, who &s;ubmitted to them, and paid illegal Taxes, were more to blame, <MILESTONE N="40"> and greater Enemies to their Country than they who had impo&s;ed them; and that the Tyranny of Princes could never be grievous, but&endq; by the tamene&s;s and &s;tupidity of the People.</Q> <Q>When <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;aw that he could not convert him, he told him &startq;that he had a Will as &s;tubborn as His, and he would try which of them two &s;hould be Ma|&s;ter.&endq;</Q> Thereupon, with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of reproach and contempt, he committed the Man to pri&s;on; who&s;e courage was nothing abated by it; but a&s;&s;oon as the Term came, he brought his <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> in the King's Bench, which they then called the <HI>Upper</HI> Bench. <HI>Maynard,</HI> who was of Council with the Pri&s;oner, demanded his Liberty with <MILESTONE N="50"> great confidence, both upon the illegality of the Commitment, and the illegality of the impo&s;ition, as being laid without any lawful Au|thority. The Judges could not maintain or defend either, and enough
<PB N="507" REF="5190">
declared what their Sentence would be; and therefore the Protector's Atturney required a farther day, to an&s;wer what had been urged. Before that day, <HI>Maynard</HI> was committed to the Tower, for pre&s;uming to que|&s;tion or make doubt of his Authority; and the Judges were &s;ent for, and &s;everely reprehended for &s;uffering that Licence; when they, with all humility, mention'd the Law and <HI>Magna Charta, Cromwell</HI> told them, with terms of contempt, and deri&s;ion, <Q>&startq;their <HI>Magna F&mdash;</HI>&s;hould not controle his Actions; which he knew were for the &s;afety of the Com|mon-wealth.&endq;</Q> <Q>He asked them, &startq;who made them Judges? whether they had any Authority to &s;it there, but what He gave them? and if his Au|thority <MILESTONE N="10"> were at an end, they knew well enough, what would become of them&s;elves; and therefore advi&s;ed them to be more tender of that which could only pre&s;erve them; and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with caution, that they &s;hould not &s;uffer the Lawyers to prate what it would not&endq; become Them to hear.</Q></P>
<P>THUS he &s;ubdued a &s;pirit that had been often trouble&s;ome to the mo&s;t Soveraign power, and made <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-</HI>Hall as obedient, and &s;ub|&s;ervient to his Commands, as any of the re&s;t of his Quarters. In all other matters, which did not concern the life of his Juri&s;diction, he &s;eem'd to have great reverence for the Law, rarely interpo&s;ing between Party and <MILESTONE N="20"> Party. As he proceeded with this kind of indignation, and haughtine&s;s, with tho&s;e who were refractory, and dur&s;t contend with his greatne&s;s, &s;o towards all who complied with his good plea&s;ure, and courted his Pro|tection, he u&s;ed great civility, genero&s;ity, and bounty.</P>
<P>TO reduce three Nations, which perfectly hated him, to an entire obe|dience to all his Dictates; to awe, and govern tho&s;e Nations by an Army that was indevoted to him, and wi&s;h'd his ruin, was an In&s;tance of a very prodigious addre&s;s. But his greatne&s;s at home, was but a &s;hadow of the glory he had abroad. It was hard to di&s;cover, which fear'd him mo&s;t, <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or the Low Countries, where his friend&s;hip was current at <MILESTONE N="30"> the value he put upon it. As they did all &s;acrifice their Honour, and their Intere&s;t, to his plea&s;ure, &s;o there is nothing he could have demanded, that either of them would have denied him. To manife&s;t which, there needs only two In&s;tances. The fir&s;t is, when tho&s;e of the Valley of <HI>Lu|cern</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two In&s;tances of his Intere&s;t among foreign Princes.</NOTE> had unwarily ri&s;en in Armes again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> which gave occa&s;ion to the Pope, and the Neighbour Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> to call and &s;ollicite for their extirpation, and their Prince po&s;itively re&s;olv'd upon it, <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ent his Agent to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> a Prince with whom he had no corre&s;pondence, or commerce, and &s;o engaged the Cardinal, and even terrified the Pope him&s;elf, without &s;o much as doing any Grace <MILESTONE N="40"> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Roman Catholicks (nothing being more u&s;ual than his &s;ay|ing, <Q>&startq;that his Ships in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> &s;hould vi&s;it <HI>Civita Vecchia;&endq;</HI> and that the &s;ound of his Cannon &s;hould be heard in <HI>Rome)</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore all that he had taken from them, and did renew all tho&s;e Privileges they had formerly enjoyed, and newly forfeited.</Q></P>
<P>THE other In&s;tance of his Authority was yet greater, and more in|credible. In the City of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> which is one of the faire&s;t in the Pro|vince of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and where tho&s;e of the Religion do mo&s;t abound, <MILESTONE N="50"> there was a great Faction at that Sea&s;on when the Con&s;uls (who are the Chief Magi&s;trates) were to be cho&s;en. Tho&s;e of the Reform'd Re|ligion had the confidence to &s;et up one of them&s;elves for that Magi&s;tracy; which they of the Roman Religion re&s;olv'd to oppo&s;e with all their
<PB N="508" REF="5200">
power. The di&s;&s;en&s;ion between them made &s;o much noi&s;e, that the In|tendant of the Province, who is the &s;upreme Mini&s;ter in all Civil Af|fairs throughout the whole Province, went thither to prevent any di&s;|order that might happen. When the day of Election came, tho&s;e of the Religion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with many arm'd Men of the Town-Hou&s;e, where the Election was to be made. The Magi&s;trates &s;ent to know what their meaning was; <Q>to which they an&s;wer'd, &startq;they were there to give their Voices for the choice of the new Con&s;uls, and to be &s;ure that the&endq; Election &s;hould be fairly made.</Q> The Bi&s;hop of the City, the Intendant of the Province, with all the Officers of the Church, and the pre&s;ent Ma|gi&s;trates <MILESTONE N="10"> of the Town, went together in their Robes to be pre&s;ent at the Election, without any &s;u&s;picion that there would be any Force u&s;ed. When they came near the Gate of the Town-Hou&s;e, which was &s;hut, and they &s;uppo&s;ed would be open'd when they came, they within pour'd out a Volly of Musket &s;hot upon them, by which the Dean of the Church, and two or three of the Magi&s;trates of the Town, were kill'd upon the place, and very many others wounded; whereof &s;ome died &s;hortly af|ter. In this Confu&s;ion, the Magi&s;trates put them&s;elves into as good a po&s;ture to defend them&s;elves as they could, without any purpo&s;e of of|fending the other, till they &s;hould be better provided; in order to which <MILESTONE N="20"> they &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Court with a plain relation of the whole matter of fact, <Q>&startq;and that there appear'd to be no manner of Combina|tion with tho&s;e of the Religion in other places of the Province; but that it was an in&s;olence in tho&s;e of the place, upon the pre&s;umption of their great Numbers, which were little inferior to tho&s;e of the Ca|tholicks.&endq;</Q> The Court was glad of the Occa&s;ion, and re&s;olv'd that this provocation, in which other places were not involv'd, and which no body could excu&s;e, &s;hould warrant all kind of &s;everity in that City, even to the pulling down their Temples, and expelling many of them for ever out of the City; which, with the execution and forfeiture of many of <MILESTONE N="30"> the principal Per&s;ons, would be a general Mortification to all of the Re|ligion in <HI>France;</HI> with whom they were heartily offended; and a part of the Army was forthwith order'd to march towards <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> to &s;ee this executed with the utmo&s;t rigour.</P>
<P>THOSE of the Religion in the Town, were quickly &s;en&s;ible into what condition they had brought them&s;elves; and &s;ent, with all po&s;&s;i|ble Submi&s;&s;ion, to the Magi&s;trates to excu&s;e them&s;elves, and to im|pute what had been done to the ra&s;hne&s;s of particular Men, who had no order for what they did. <Q>The Magi&s;trates an&s;wer'd, &startq;that they were glad they were &s;en&s;ible of their Mi&s;carriage; but they could &s;ay no|thing <MILESTONE N="40"> upon the Subject, till the King's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known;&endq; to whom they had &s;ent a full relation of all that had pa&s;&s;ed.</Q> The others very well knew what the King's plea&s;ure would be, and forth|with &s;ent an Expre&s;s, one <HI>Moulins,</HI> who had liv'd many years in that place, and in <HI>Montpellier,</HI> to <HI>Cromwell</HI> to de&s;ire his protection and interpo&s;ition. The Expre&s;s made &s;o much ha&s;t, and found &s;o good a reception the fir&s;t hour he came, that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> after he had receiv'd the whole Account, <Q>bad him &startq;refre&s;h him&s;elf after &s;o long a Journey, and he would take &s;uch care of his bu&s;ine&s;s, that by the time he&endq; came to <HI>Paris</HI> he &s;hould find it di&s;patched;</Q> and, that Night, &s;ent <MILESTONE N="50"> away another Me&s;&s;enger to his Emba&s;&s;adour <HI>Lockhart;</HI> who, by the time <HI>Moulins</HI> came thither, had &s;o far prevailed with the Cardinal, that Orders were &s;ent to &s;top the Troops, which were upon their

March towards <HI>Ni&s;mes;</HI> and, within few days after, <HI>Moulins</HI> return'd with a full Pardon, and Amne&s;ty from the King, under the Great Seal of <HI>France,</HI> &s;o fully confirm'd with all circum&s;tances, that there was never farther mention made of it, but all things pa&s;&s;ed as if there had never been any &s;uch thing. So that no body can wonder, that his Memory remains &s;till in tho&s;e parts, and with tho&s;e People, in great veneration.</P>
<P><Q>HE would never &s;uffer him&s;elf to be denied any thing he ever asked of the Cardinal, alledging, &startq;that the People would not be otherwi&s;e&endq; &s;atisfied;</Q> which the Cardinal bore very heavily, and complain'd of <MILESTONE N="10"> to tho&s;e with whom he would be free. One day, he vi&s;ited Madam <HI>Turenne,</HI> and when he took his leave of her, She, according to her Cu&s;tom, be&s;ought him to continue gracious to the Churches. <Q>Where|upon the Cardinal told her, &startq;that he knew not how to behave him|&s;elf; if he advi&s;ed the King to puni&s;h and &s;uppre&s;s their In&s;olence, <HI>Cromwell</HI> threaten'd him to joyn with the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and if he &s;hew'd&endq; any favour to them, at <HI>Rome</HI> they accounted him an Heretick.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude his Character, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not &s;o far a Man of blood, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conclu&s;ion of his Chara|cter.</NOTE> as to follow <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s method; which pre&s;cribes, upon a total al|teration of Government, as a thing ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to cut off all <MILESTONE N="20"> the heads of tho&s;e, and extirpate their Families, who are Friends to the old one.

In a word, as he was guilty of many Crimes again&s;t which Damnation is de|nounced, and for which Hell-fire is prepared, &s;o he had &s;ome good Qua|lities which have cau&s;ed the Memory of &s;ome Men in all Ages to be cele|brated; and he will be look'd upon by Po&s;terity as a brave wicked Man.</P>

Be&s;ides the expectation the King had from the general Affection of the Kingdom, he had fair promi&s;es from Men of Intere&s;t in it, and of Command in the Ar|my, who profe&s;&s;ed to prepare for &s;uch a Con|juncture as this; and that the di&s;order ari&s;ing from <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s death <MILESTONE N="10"> might di&s;po&s;e <HI>Lockhart</HI> to depend upon the be&s;t Title, &s;eem'd a rea&s;on|able expectation: but nothing of this fell out. Never Monarch, after he had inherited a Crown by many de&s;cents, died in more &s;ilence, nor with le&s;s alteration; and there was the &s;ame, or a greater calm in the King|dom than had been before.</P>
<P>THE next morning after the death of <HI>Oliver, Richard</HI> his Son is pro|claim'd his Lawful Succe&s;&s;or; the Army congratulate their new Ge|neral, and renew their Vows of fidelity to him; the Navy doth the like; the City appears more unanimous for His Service, than they were for <MILESTONE N="20"> his Father's; and mo&s;t Counties in <HI>England,</HI> by Addre&s;&s;es under their hands, te&s;tified their obedience to their new Soveraign without any he|&s;itation. The dead is interr'd in the Sepulcher of the Kings, and with the ob&s;equies due to &s;uch. His Son inherits all his Greatne&s;s, and all his
<PB N="514" REF="5240">
Glory, without the publick hate, that vi&s;ibly attended the other. Fo|reign Princes addre&s;&s;ed their Condoleances to him, and de&s;ired to renew their Alliances; and nothing was heard in <HI>England</HI> but the voice of Joy, and large Encomiums of their new Protector: &s;o that the King's con|dition never appear'd &s;o hopele&s;s, &s;o de&s;perate; for a more favourable Conjuncture his Friends could never expect than this, which now &s;eem'd to bla&s;t all their hopes, and confirm their utmo&s;t de&s;pair.</P>
<P>IT is probable that this Melancholick pro&s;pect might have continued long, if this Child of Fortune could have &s;ate &s;till, and been contented to have enjoyed his own felicity. But his Council thought it nece&s;&s;ary <MILESTONE N="10"> that he &s;hould call a Parliament, to confirm what they had already given him, and to di&s;pel all Clouds which might ari&s;e. And there &s;eem'd to be the more rea&s;on for it, becau&s;e the la&s;t Alliance which <HI>Oliver</HI> had made with the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and of which he was fonder than of all the re&s;t, did oblige him in the Spring to &s;end a &s;trong Fleet into the <HI>Sound,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t that King again&s;t <HI>Denmark;</HI> at lea&s;t to induce <HI>Denmark,</HI> by way of mediation, to accept of &s;uch conditions as the other would be willing to give him. This could hardly be done without &s;ome a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of Parliament; and therefore the new Protector &s;ent out his Writs to call a Parliament, to meet together on the twenty &s;eventh day of <HI>Ja|nuary;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He calls a Parliament to meet</HI> Jan. 27. 1659</NOTE> till which day, for near five Months, he remain'd as great a Prince as ever his Father had been. He follow'd the Model that was left him, and &s;ent out his Writs to call tho&s;e as Peers who had con&s;tituted the other Hou&s;e in the former Parliament; and &s;o both Lords and Com|mons <NOTE PLACE="marg">It meets on that day.</NOTE> met at the day a&s;&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>RICHARD came to the Parliament in the &s;ame State that <HI>Oliver</HI> his Father had done; and &s;ent the Gentleman U&s;her of the Black-rod to the Commons, that they &s;hould attend him in the other Hou&s;e; where, fir&s;t by him&s;elf, and then by the Keeper of his Great Seal, <HI>Nathaniel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The bu&s;ine&s;s recommended to them by the Protector.</NOTE> <HI>Fiennes,</HI> he recommended to them the pro&s;ecution of the War with <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Spain,</HI> and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the <HI>Sound.</HI> He had &s;o good fortune at the beginning, that all the Commons &s;ign'd an <HI>En|gagement</HI> not to alter the pre&s;ent Government. But they were no &s;ooner inclo&s;ed within tho&s;e Walls, than there appear'd the old Republican Spirit, though more wary than it had u&s;ed to be. It begun with en|quiring <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Differences ri&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons about the Accounts of Money, and about the o|ther Hou&s;e</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> into the Accounts, how the Money had been &s;pent, and into the Offices of Exci&s;e and Cu&s;toms, and what was become of all that Revenue. When they were called upon to &s;ettle the Act of Recogni|tion, to confirm <HI>Richard,</HI> and his Authority in the State, they would fir&s;t inform them&s;elves of their own Authority, and how far the Go|vernment <MILESTONE N="40"> was already &s;ettled, and what part was fit to be a&s;&s;ign'd to the other Hou&s;e; which they would by no means allow to be a part of the Government already e&s;tabli&s;h'd, which they had promi&s;ed not to alter. Upon this Argument they exerci&s;ed them&s;elves with great Licence, as well upon the Creator of tho&s;e Peers, and the power of the late Pro|tector, as upon his Creatures the Peers; of who&s;e dignity they were not tender, but handled them according to the Quality they had been of, not that which they were now grown to. <Q>They put the Hou&s;e in mind, &startq;how grievous it had been to the Kingdom, that the Bi&s;hops had &s;ate in the Hou&s;e of Peers, becau&s;e they were look'd upon as &s;o many <MILESTONE N="50"> Votes for the King; which was a rea&s;on much &s;tronger again&s;t the&s;e Per&s;ons; who were all the work of the Protector's own hand, and there|fore&endq; could not but be entirely addicted and devoted to his Intere&s;t.</Q>
<Q><PB N="515" REF="5250">
They concluded, &startq;that they could not, with good Con&s;ciences, and without the guilt of Perjury, ever con&s;ent, that that other Hou&s;e &s;hould have any part in the Government, &s;ince they had all taken the Engagement, that there &s;hould be no more any Hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;ince the Office of Protector had been, and might &s;till continue with|out&endq; it.</Q></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this confidence, which di&s;turbed the Me|thod intended to be proceeded in, this violent Party could not prevail, but it was carried by the Major part of the Hou&s;e, <Q>&startq;that they would <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was carried, that the other Hou&s;e &s;hould be allowed.</NOTE> meet, and confer with the other Hou&s;e, as a part of the Parliament, during this pre&s;ent Parliament; and likewi&s;e, that &s;uch other Per&s;ons, <MILESTONE N="10"> as had a right to come to that other Hou&s;e, and had not forfeited it&endq; by their breach of Tru&s;t (by which they meant tho&s;e Lords who had been allways again&s;t the King)</Q> <Q>&startq;&endq;&s;hould not be re&s;train'd from coming thither:</Q> yet the Temper of the Hou&s;e of Commons could hardly be judged by all this. Some things were done, which looked like con|de&s;cen&s;ion to the Royal Party; but more for the countenance of $Word$ <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> and what&s;oever contradicted tho&s;e who were for a Re|publick, was looked upon as favourable to the Protector.</P>
<P>THE &s;tirring the&s;e &s;everal humours, and the drow&s;y temper of <HI>Ri|chard,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> rai&s;ed another Spirit in the Army. A new Council of Officers <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new $Word$ of Officers met, who con&s;ult about the Go|vernment.</NOTE> met together by their own Authority, and admitted <HI>Lambert,</HI> though no Member of the Army, to con&s;ult with them; they neither liked Protector, nor Parliament, but con&s;ulted what Government to &s;ettle, that might be better than either: yet they would not incen&s;e them both together, nor appear to have any di&s;inclination to <HI>Richard,</HI> who had many of his neare&s;t Friends among&s;t them. They therefore prepared an <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Addre&s;s to Richard</HI> April 6. 1659</NOTE> Addre&s;s to him; <Q>in which they complain'd of &startq;the great Arrears of pay that were due to the Army, by which they were in great Streights: that they, who had borne the brunt of the War, and undergone all the difficulties and dangers of it, were now undervalued, derided, <MILESTONE N="30"> and laid a&s;ide: that the good old Cau&s;e was ill &s;poken of, and tra|duced by Malignants and di&s;affected Per&s;ons; who grew every day more in&s;olent, and their Numbers encrea&s;ed, by the re&s;ort out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and other places; and they had &s;everal &s;ecret meetings in the City of <HI>London:</HI> that the Names of all tho&s;e who had &s;ate upon the late King as his Judges, were lately printed, and &s;catter'd abroad, as if they were de&s;ign'd to de&s;truction; and that many Suits were commenced at Common Law again&s;t hone&s;t Men, for what they had tran&s;acted in the War as Soldiers: that tho&s;e famous Acts, which had been performed in the long Parliament, and by the late Protector,&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> were cen&s;ured, railed at, and vilified.</Q> <Q>By all which, they &s;aid, &startq;it was very manife&s;t, that the good old Cau&s;e was declined; which they were re&s;olv'd to a&s;&s;ert.

<P>THIS Addre&s;s was deliver'd from the Army by <HI>Fleetwood</HI> to <HI>Ri|chard,</HI> on <HI>April</HI> 6^t^h. 1659; which was no &s;ooner known, than <HI>Tichburn,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The City Mili+tia &s;econd them</NOTE> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> two Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> and principal Commanders of that Militia, drew up likewi&s;e a Remon&s;trance, and &s;ent it to the Coun|cil of Officers; in which they declared their Re&s;olutions with the Army <MILESTONE N="50"> to &s;tick to the good old Cau&s;e, and that they were re&s;olv'd to accompany them, in what&s;oever they &s;hould do for what they call'd the Nation's good.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="5260">
THE Parliament was quickly alarm'd with the&s;e Cabals of the Army, and the City; which <HI>Richard</HI> was as much terrified with, as They. In order to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion thereof, the Parliament voted, <Q>&startq;that there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Votes of the Parliament upon it.</NOTE> &s;hould be no meeting, or general Council of Officers, without the Protector's con&s;ent, and by his Order: and, that no Per&s;on &s;hould have Commands by Sea or Land, in either of the three Nations, who did not immediately &s;ub&s;cribe, that he would not di&s;turb the free meet|ing of Parliaments, or of any Members in either Hou&s;e of Parliament;&endq; nor ob&s;truct their freedom in Debates and Coun&s;els.</Q> The&s;e Votes, or to this effect, were &s;ent to <HI>Richard,</HI> and by Him pre&s;ently to <HI>Walling|ford</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> Hou&s;e, where the Council of Officers then &s;ate.</P>
<P>THESE Officers were Men who re&s;olv'd to execute as well as order; they knew well that they were gone much too far, if they went no far|ther: and therefore they no &s;ooner receiv'd the&s;e votes, but they &s;ent <HI>Fleetwood</HI> and <HI>Desborough</HI> to <HI>Richard</HI> (the fir&s;t had married his Si&s;ter; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Officers advi&s;e him to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament:</NOTE> the other was his Uncle; both rai&s;ed by <HI>Cromwell)</HI> to advi&s;e him forth|with to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament. They were two upon who&s;e Affection, in regard of the nearne&s;s of their Alliance, and their obligation to, and dependence upon his Father, he had as much rea&s;on to be confident, as on any Men's in the Nation. <Q><HI>Fleetwood</HI> u&s;ed no Arguments but of <MILESTONE N="20"> Con&s;cience, &startq;&endq;to prevent the Nation's being engaged in blood;</Q> <Q>which, he &s;aid, &startq;would inevitably fall out, if the Parliament were not pre&s;ent|ly&endq; di&s;&s;olved.</Q> <Q><HI>Desborough,</HI> a fellow of a rough and rude temper, treated him only with threats, and menaces; told him, &startq;it was impo&s;&s;ible for&endq; him to keep both the Parliament, and the Army, his Friends;</Q> <Q>wi&s;hed him, &startq;to choo&s;e which he would prefer: if he di&s;&s;olved the Parlia|ment out of hand, he had the Army at his Devotion; if he refu&s;ed that, he believed the Army would quickly pull him out of <HI>White-Hall.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE poor Man had not Spirit enough to di&s;cern what was be&s;t for <MILESTONE N="30"> him; and yet he was not without Friends to coun&s;el him, if he had been capable to receive Coun&s;el. <Q>Be&s;ides many Members of the Parliament, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Advice to</HI> Ri|chard <HI>to the contrary:</HI></NOTE> of Courage and Intere&s;t, who repair'd to him with a&s;&s;urance, &startq;that the Parliament would continue firm to him, and de&s;troy the Ringleaders of this &s;editious Crew, if he would adhere to the Parliament; but if he were prevailed upon to di&s;&s;olve it, he would be left without a friend; and They who had compell'd him to do &s;o imprudent an action, would&endq; contemn him when he had done it:</Q> <Q>&s;ome Officers of the Army like|wi&s;e, of equal Courage and Intere&s;t with any of the re&s;t, per&s;waded <NOTE PLACE="marg">And of &s;ome Officers of the Army.</NOTE> him &startq;to reject the de&s;ire of tho&s;e who call'd them&s;elves the Council of&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> the Army, and to think of puni&s;hing their pre&s;umption.</Q> <HI>Ingoldsby, Whaley,</HI> and <HI>Goffe,</HI> three Colonels of the Army, and, the two former, Men of &s;ignal Courage, offer'd to &s;tand by him; and one of them offer'd to kill <HI>Lambert</HI> (whom they looked upon as the Author of this Con|&s;piracy) if he would give him a Warrant to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>RICHARD continued irre&s;olute, now inclined one way, then ano|ther.

So that when <HI>Fiennes</HI> &s;ent for them to the other Hou&s;e, the Commons &s;hut the door of their Hou&s;e, and would not &s;uffer the Gentleman U&s;her of the Black-rod to come in, but ad|journed

them&s;elves for three days, till the five and twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> imagining that they &s;hould by that time convert the Protector from de|&s;troying him&s;elf. But the poor Creature was &s;o hared by the Council of Officers, that he pre&s;ently cau&s;ed a Proclamation to be i&s;&s;ued out, by <NOTE PLACE="marg">He i&s;&s;ues out a Proclamation to that pur|po&s;e; where|upon his Pro|tector&s;hip wa$ at an end.</NOTE> which he did declare the Parliament to be di&s;&s;olved. And from that mi|nute no body re&s;orted to him, nor was the name of the Protector after|wards heard of but in deri&s;ion; the Council of Officers appointing Guards to attend at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> which kept out tho&s;e Members, who, in pur|&s;uance of their adjournment, would have enter'd into the Hou&s;e upon the day appointed. Thus, by extreme pu&s;illanimity, the Son &s;uffer'd <MILESTONE N="10"> him&s;elf to be &s;tripped, in one moment, of all the greatne&s;s, and power, which the Father had acquired in &s;o many years, with wonderful cou|rage, indu&s;try, and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>WHEN the Council of Officers had, with this &s;trange &s;ucce&s;s, having no authority but what they gave one another, rid them&s;elves of a Su|periour; or, as the Phra&s;e then was, removed the <HI>&s;ingle Per&s;on,</HI> they knew that they could not long hold the Government in their own hands, if, before any thing el&s;e, they did not remove <HI>Ingoldsby, Whaley, Goffe,</HI> and tho&s;e other Officers, who had di&s;&s;waded <HI>Richard</HI> from &s;ubmitting to their Advice, from having any Command in the Army; which they <MILESTONE N="20"> therefore did; and replaced <HI>Lambert,</HI> and all the re&s;t who had been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Council of Officers re&s;tore</HI> Lambert, &amp;c. <HI>to the Army, and remove many of</HI> Gromwell<HI>'s Friends.

So that the Army was become Republican to their wi&s;h; and that the Government might return to be purely &s;uch, they publi&s;hed a Declaration upon the &s;ixth of <HI>May,</HI> wherein, after a large preamble in commendation of the good old Cau&s;e, and accu&s;ing them&s;elves, <Q>&startq;for having been in&s;trumental in de|clining from it; whence all the ills, the Common-wealth had &s;u&s;tain'd, had proceeded, and the vindication whereof they were re&s;olv'd to pur|&s;ue&endq; for the future;</Q> <Q>they remember'd, &startq;that the long Parliament, con|&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e Members who had continued to &s;it till the twentieth of&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>April</HI> 1653 (which was the day that <HI>Cromwell,</HI></Q> with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e very Officers, <Q>had pull'd them out of the Hou&s;e, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them) &startq;had been eminent A&s;&s;ertors of that Cau&s;e, and had a &s;pecial&endq; pre&s;ence of God with them, and were &s;ignally ble&s;&s;ed in that work.</Q> <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;that, the de&s;ires of many good People concurring with them, they did, by that Declaration, according to their duty, invite tho&s;e Members to return to the di&s;charge of their Tru&s;t, as they had done&endq; before that day;</Q> <Q>and promi&s;ed, &startq;that they would be ready, in their places, to yield them their utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that they might &s;it, and con&s;ult in &s;afety, for the &s;etling and &s;ecuring the peace and quiet of&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> the Common-wealth, for which they had now &s;o good an opportunity.</Q> And this Declaration, within very few days, they &s;econded with what they call'd <HI>The Humble Petition and Addre&s;s of the Officers of the Army to the Parliament;</HI> which contain'd &s;everal advices, or rather po&s;itive directions how they were to govern.</P>
<P>THIS re&s;toring the Rump-Parliament was the only way in which they could mo&s;t agree, though it was not &s;uitable to what &s;ome of them de&s;ired: They well fore&s;aw, that they might give an opportunity to more People to come together than would be for their benefit; for that all the &s;urviving Members of that Parliament would pretend a Ti|tle <MILESTONE N="50"> to &s;it there: and therefore, they did not only carefully limit the Con|vention to &s;uch Members who had continued to &s;it from <HI>January</HI> 1648 to <HI>April</HI> 1653, but cau&s;ed a Guard likewi&s;e to attend to hinder, and

keep the other Members from entring into the Hou&s;e. When <HI>Lenthal,</HI> the old Speaker, with forty or fifty of tho&s;e old Members &s;pecified in the Declaration, took their places in the Hou&s;e, and &s;ome of the old <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of the old, Excluded Members went into the Hou&s;e $Word$ them, $Word$ were ex|$luded again.</NOTE> excluded Members likewi&s;e got in, and enter'd into Debate with them upon the matters propo&s;ed, the Hou&s;e was adjourn'd till the next day: and then better care was taken, by appointing &s;uch Per&s;ons, who well knew all the Members, to inform the Guards, who were, and who were Not, to go into the Hou&s;e. By this means that Cabal only was &s;uffer'd to enter which had fir&s;t form'd the Common-wealth, and fo&s;ter'd it for near five years after it was born. So that the return of the Government <MILESTONE N="10"> into the&s;e Men's hands again, &s;eem'd to be the mo&s;t di&s;mal change that could happen, and to pull up all the hopes of the King by the roots.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t, for the better ob&s;ervation, and di&s;tinction of the &s;everal Changes in the Government, call this Congregation of Men, who were now repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, by the Style they call'd them&s;elves, the Parlia|ment; how far &s;oever they were from being one. They re&s;olv'd in the fir&s;t place to vindicate, and e&s;tabli&s;h their own Authority; which they could not think to be firm, whil&s;t there was &s;till a Protector, or the Name of a Protector in being, and re&s;iding in <HI>White-Hall.</HI> They ap|pointed therefore a Committee to go to <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> and, that <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment &s;ent to</HI> Richard <HI>to know whether he acquie&s;ced, and &s;ubmitted to their Au|thority.</HI></NOTE> he might have hope they would be his good Ma&s;ters, fir&s;t to enquire into the State of his Debts, and then to demand of him, whether He acquie&s;ced in the pre&s;ent Government? He, already humbled to that poverty of Spirit they could wi&s;h, gave the Committee a paper, <Q>&startq;in which, he &s;aid, was contain'd the State of his Debts, and how con|tracted;&endq;</Q> which amounted to twenty nine thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and forty pounds.</P>
<P><Q>TO the other Que&s;tion, his An&s;wer was likewi&s;e in Writing; &startq;that He tru&s;ted, his carriage and behaviour had manife&s;ted his Acquie&s;cence in the Will and good plea&s;ure of God, and that he loved and valued <MILESTONE N="30"> the Peace of the Common-wealth much above his private concern|ment; de&s;iring by this, that a mea&s;ure of his future comportment might be taken; which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;hould be &s;uch as &s;hould bear the &s;ame Witne&s;s; he having, he hoped, in &s;ome degree learned rather to reverence and &s;ubmit to the hand of God, than he unquiet under it: that, as to the late providence that had fallen out, however, in re&s;pect to the particular engagement that lay upon him, he could not be active in making a Change in the Government of the Nations, yet, through the goodne&s;s of God, he could freely acquie&s;ce in it being made; and did hold him&s;elf obliged, as with other Men he might expect protection from the pre&s;ent Government, &s;o to de|mean <MILESTONE N="40"> him&s;elf with all peaceablene&s;s under it, and to procure, to the uttermo&s;t of his power, that all in whom he had Intere&s;t &s;hould do the&endq; &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;atisfied them as to <HI>Richard;</HI> but they were not without ap|prehen&s;ion that they &s;hould find a more refractory Spirit in his Brother <HI>Harry,</HI> who was Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and looked upon as a Man of another air and temper. He had in his Exerci&s;e of that Government, by the frankne&s;s of his humour, and a general civility towards all, and very particularly obliging &s;ome, render'd him&s;elf gracious and popular <MILESTONE N="50"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry Crom|well <HI>likewi&s;e &s;ubmits, and re&s;igns his Commi&s;&s;ion of Lieutenant of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> to all &s;orts of People, and might have been able to have made &s;ome conte&s;ts with the Parliament.

After he had lived &s;ome years in <HI>Paris</HI> untaken notice of, and indeed unknown, living in a mo&s;t ob&s;cure condi|tion and di&s;gui&s;e, not owning his own Name, nor having above one Ser|vant to attend him, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary, upon the fir&s;t rumour and ap|prehen&s;ion that there was like to be a War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> to quit that Kingdom, and to remove to &s;ome place that would be neu|tral to either Party; and pitched upon <HI>Geneva.</HI> Making his way thither by <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and through the Province of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed <MILESTONE N="20"> through <HI>Pezenas,</HI> a very plea&s;ant Town belonging to the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> who hath a fair Palace there, and, being then Governour of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> made his Re&s;idence in it.</P>
<P>IN this place <HI>Richard</HI> made &s;ome &s;tay, and walking abroad to enter|tain him&s;elf with the view of the Situation, and of many things worth the &s;eeing, he met with a Per&s;on who well knew him, and was well known by him, the other having allways been of his Father's, and of His Party; &s;o that they were glad enough to find them&s;elves together. <Q>The other told him, &startq;that all Strangers who came to that Town, u&s;ed to wait upon the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> the Governour of the Province; <MILESTONE N="30"> who expected it, and allways treated Strangers, and particularly the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with much civility: that he need not be known, but that he him&s;elf would fir&s;t go to the Prince and inform him, that another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman was pa&s;&s;ing through that Town towards <HI>Italy,</HI> who&endq; would be glad to have the honour to ki&s;s his hands.</Q> The Prince re|ceiv'd him with great civility and grace, according to his Natural cu&s;tom, and, after few words, begun to di&s;cour&s;e of the Affairs of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and asked many que&s;tions concerning the King, and whether all Men were quiet, and &s;ubmitted obediently to him; which the other an&s;wer'd briefly, according to the truth. <Q>&startq;&endq;Well,</Q> &s;aid the Prince, <Q><HI>&startq;Oli|ver,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> though he was a Traytor and a Villain, was a brave Fellow, had great Parts, great Courage, and was worthy to Command; but that <HI>Richard,</HI> that Coxcomb, <HI>Coquin, Poltron,</HI> was &s;urely the ba&s;e&s;t fellow alive; What is become of that Fool? How was it po&s;&s;ible he could be&endq; &s;uch a Sot?</Q> <Q>He an&s;wer'd, &startq;that he was betrayed by tho&s;e whom he&endq; mo&s;t tru&s;ted, and who had been mo&s;t obliged by his Father;</Q> &s;o being weary of his Vi&s;it, quickly took his leave, and the next morning left the Town, out of fear that the Prince might know that He was the very Fool and Coxcomb he had mention'd &s;o kindly. And within two days after, the Prince did come to know who it was whom he had treated <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;o well, and whom before, by his behaviour, he had believ'd to be a Man not very glad of the King's Re&s;toration.</P>

<P>NOW there appear'd as great a Calm as ever, and their Government well &s;ettled, to the general content of the People of their Party, who <MILESTONE N="20"> te&s;tified the &s;ame by their Acclamations, and likewi&s;e by particular Ad|dre&s;&s;es.

And accordingly all the Officers of the Army, and Navy (for the Speaker was Admiral as <MILESTONE N="30"> well as General) deliver'd up their Commi&s;&s;ions, and took new Ones in the form that was pre&s;cribed. So that now they &s;aw not how their Em|pire could be &s;haken.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e Men had not &s;ate long in their old places, when they call'd to mind how they had been u&s;ed after they had been depo&s;ed, the re|proaches, and the contempt they underwent from all kind of People; but above all, the &s;coffs and deri&s;ion they &s;uffer'd from the King's Party, when they &s;aw them reduced to the &s;ame level in Power and Authority with them&s;elves.

The Soldiers were very merry <MILESTONE N="50"> at their new General; and thought it nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould march with them upon the next Adventure; and the Officers thought they had de|&s;erv'd more than an Act of Indemnity, for re&s;toring them to &s;uch a So|veraignty.

In a word, as the Parliament remember'd how They had been u&s;ed, &s;o all other People remember'd how they had u&s;ed Them, and could not bring them&s;elves to look with reverence upon tho&s;e, whom, for above four years together, they had derided and con|temn'd.</P>
<P>THIS univer&s;al temper rai&s;ed the Spirits again of the King's Friends, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Party begin$ to move</NOTE> who found very many of tho&s;e who had heretofore &s;erv'd the Parlia|ment, and been afterwards di&s;obliged both by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the Rump Parliament, very de&s;irous to enter into Amity with them, and to make a firm conjunction with them towards the King's Ree&s;tabli&s;hment. <MILESTONE N="10"> Tho&s;e Members of the long Parliament, who, after the Treaty of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> were by violence kept from the Hou&s;e, took it in great indignation, that They, upon whom the &s;aid violence was practiced af|terwards, which they had fir&s;t countenanced upon them, &s;hould not re&s;tore them being now re&s;tored them&s;elves, and were ready to embrace any occa&s;ion to di&s;turb their new Governours; to which they were the more encouraged by the common di&s;cour&s;e of the Soldiers; <Q>who de|clared, &startq;that, if there were any commotion in the Kingdom, they&endq; would go no farther to &s;uppre&s;s it, than <HI>Lenthal</HI> &s;hould lead them.</Q></P>
<P>M^r MORDAUNT, who had &s;o lately his head upon the Block, was <MILESTONE N="20"> more active than any Man; and was &s;o well tru&s;ted by Men of all con|ditions, upon the Courage of his former behaviour, that he had in truth very full engagements from very good Men in mo&s;t Quarters of the Kingdom, <Q>&startq;that if the King would a&s;&s;ign them a day, and promi&s;e to come to them after they were imbodyed, they would not fail to&endq; appear at the day.</Q> Whereupon, M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> ventur'd him&s;elf to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Mordaunt $Word$ <HI>to</HI> Bru&s;|&s;els <HI>to ac|quaint the</HI> $Word$ <HI>the preparations.</HI></NOTE> come in di&s;gui&s;e to the King to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> to give him a clear Account how his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tood, and what probability there was of &s;ucce&s;s, and likewi&s;e to complain of the want of forwardne&s;s in &s;ome of tho&s;e upon whom the King mo&s;t relied, to encourage other Men, and to de&s;ire that his Maje&s;ty would, by Him, require them to concur with the re&s;t. It appear'd, by the Account he gave, that there were very few Counties in <HI>England,</HI> where there was not a form'd Undertaking by the mo&s;t powerful Men of that County, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of &s;ome con&s;ider|able place in it; and if any of them &s;ucceeded, the opportunity would be fairer for the King to venture his own Per&s;on, than he yet had had, or than he was like to have, if he &s;uffer'd tho&s;e who were now in the Government, to be &s;ettled in it.</P>
<P>THAT which was be&s;t dige&s;ted, and, in re&s;pect of the Undertakers, mo&s;t like to &s;ucceed, was, fir&s;t the &s;urpri&s;al and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of <HI>Lynne,</HI> a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A de&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing</HI> Lynne <HI>by the Lord</HI> Wil|loughby <HI>of</HI> Patham <HI>and S^r</HI> Horatio Town&s;end</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> Maritime Town, of great importance in re&s;pect of the Situation, and likewi&s;e of the good Affection of the Gentlemen of the parts adjacent.

<P>WHEN the King receiv'd this Account in gro&s;s from a Per&s;on &s;o well in&s;tructed, whereof he had by retail receiv'd much from the Per&s;ons concern'd (for it was another circum&s;tance of the loo&s;ene&s;s of the pre|&s;ent Government, that Me&s;&s;engers went forward and backward with all &s;ecurity) and likewi&s;e found by M^r <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> that all things were now gone &s;o far that there was no retreat, and therefore that the re&s;olution <MILESTONE N="30"> was general, <Q>&startq;that, though any di&s;covery &s;hould be made, and any Per|&s;ons impri&s;on'd, the re&s;t would proceed a&s;&s;oon as the day &s;hould be ap|pointed&endq; by the King,</Q> his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd that he would adventure his own Per&s;on, and would be ready <HI>incognito</HI> at <HI>Calais</HI> upon &s;uch a day of the Month; and that his Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI> &s;hould be likewi&s;e there, or very near, to the end that from thence, upon the Intelligence of the &s;ucce&s;s of that day, which was likewi&s;e then appointed, they might di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves, one to one place, and the other to another.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd at this time the di&s;covery of a vile Treachery, <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A di&s;covery of the Treachery of S^r</HI> Richard Willis.</NOTE> which had done the King's Affairs much harm; and had it been longer concealed, would have done much more.

<PB N="523" REF="5330">
was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know; and, as an in&s;tance of his fidelity, and his u&s;efulne&s;s, he adverti&s;ed the King of a Per&s;on who was much tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty, and con&s;tantly betrayed him; <Q>&startq;that he had receiv'd a large Pen&s;ion from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and that he continually gave <HI>Thurloe</HI> Intelligence of all that he knew; but that it was with &s;o great circum|&s;pection, that he was never &s;een in his pre&s;ence: that in his contract, he had promi&s;ed to make &s;uch di&s;coveries, as &s;hould prevent any dan|ger to the State; but that he would never endanger any Man's life, nor be produced to give in Evidence again&s;t any: and that this very Per&s;on had di&s;cover'd the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s being in <HI>London</HI> the <MILESTONE N="10"> la&s;t year, to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> but could not be induced to di&s;cover where his lodging was; only undertook his journey &s;hould be ineffectual, and that he &s;hould quickly return; and then they might take him if&endq; they could;</Q> to which he would not contribute.

<P>THE King, and They who were mo&s;t tru&s;ted by him in his &s;ecret <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King at fir&s;t believes it not.</NOTE> Tran&s;actions, believ'd not this information; but concluded that it was contrived to amu&s;e him, and to di&s;tract all his Affairs by a jealou&s;y of tho&s;e who were intru&s;ted in the conduct of them. The Gentleman ac|cu&s;ed, <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Character of the Per&s;on accu&s;ed</NOTE> was S^r <HI>Richard Willis;</HI> who had from the beginning to the end of the War, except at <HI>Newark,</HI> given te&s;timony of his Duty and Alle|giance, and was univer&s;ally thought to be &s;uperior to all temptations of infidelity. He was a Gentleman, and was very well bred, and of very good parts, a courage eminently known, and a very good Officer, and in truth of &s;o general a good reputation, that, if the King had profe&s;&s;ed to have any doubt of his hone&s;ty, his Friends would have thought he had receiv'd ill infu&s;ions without any ground; and he had given a very late te&s;timony of his &s;incerity by concealing the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who had communicated more with Him, than with any Man in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> during his being there. On the other &s;ide, all the other informa|tions, and advices, that were &s;ent by the Per&s;on who accu&s;ed him, were very important, and could have no end but his Maje&s;ty's Service; and the Offices that Gentlemen offer'd to perform for the future, were of that con&s;equence, that they could not be overvalued. This Intelligence could not be &s;ent with a hope of getting Money; for the pre&s;ent con|dition of him who &s;ent it, was &s;o good, that he expected no reward, till the King &s;hould be enabled to give it; and he who was &s;ent in the Er|rand, was likewi&s;e a Gentleman, who did not look for the Charges of his Journey: and how could it have been known to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that that <MILESTONE N="40"> Per&s;on had been tru&s;ted by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> if he had not di&s;|cover'd it him&s;elf?</P>
<P>IN this perplexity, his Maje&s;ty would not pre&s;ently depart from his confidence in the Gentleman accu&s;ed.

A great Number of his Letters were &s;ent, whereof the Character was

well known; and the Intelligence communicated, was of &s;uch things as were known to very few be&s;ides that Per&s;on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ONE thing was ob&s;erv'd throughout the whole, that he &s;eldom com|municated any thing in which there was a nece&s;&s;ity to name any Man who was of the King's Party, and had been allways &s;o reputed. But what was undertaken by any of the Presbyterian Party, or by any who had been again&s;t the King, was poured out to the life. Among&s;t tho&s;e, he gave information of <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI>'s de&s;ign upon <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and of his being concealed in &s;ome place near the &s;ame. If at any time he named any who had been of the King's Party, it was, chiefly of them who were <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;atisfied with what they had done, how little &s;oever, and re&s;olv'd to ad|venture no more. Whereupon very many were impri&s;on'd in &s;everal places, and great noi&s;e of want of &s;ecrecy, or treachery in the King's Councils; which reproach fell upon tho&s;e who were about the Per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P>IT was a new perplexity to the King, that he knew not by what means to communicate this Treachery to his Friends, le&s;t the di&s;covery of it might likewi&s;e come to light; which mu&s;t ruin a Per&s;on of merit, and di&s;appoint his Maje&s;ty of that Service, which mu&s;t be of great mo|ment. In this conjuncture, M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> came to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and in|form'd <MILESTONE N="20"> his Maje&s;ty of all tho&s;e particulars relating to the po&s;ture his friends were in, which are mention'd before; and among&s;t the other Orders he de&s;ired, one was, that &s;ome Me&s;&s;age might be &s;ent to that knot of Men, <Q>(whereof the accu&s;ed Per&s;on was one) &startq;who, he &s;aid, were principally tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty, and were all Men of honour, but &s;o wary and incredulous, that others were more di&s;couraged by their&endq; coldne&s;s;</Q> and therefore wi&s;hed, <Q>&startq;that they might be quicken'd,&endq; and required to concur with the mo&s;t forward.</Q> Hereupon the King asked him, what he thought of &s;uch a one, naming S^r <HI>Richard Wil|lis:</HI> <Q>M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> an&s;wer'd, &startq;it was of Him they complain'd prin|cipally; <MILESTONE N="30"> who, they thought, was the cau&s;e of all the warine&s;s in the re&s;t; who looked upon him not only as an excellent Officer, but as a prudent and di&s;creet Man; and therefore, for the mo&s;t part, all de|bates were referr'd to him; and he was &s;o much given to objections, and to rai&s;ing difficulties, and making things unpracticable, that mo&s;t&endq; Men had an unwillingne&s;s to make any propo&s;ition to him.</Q> The King asked him, <Q>&startq;&endq;whether he had any &s;u&s;picion of his want of hone&s;ty?</Q> the other an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that he was &s;o far from any &s;uch &s;u&s;picion, that, though he did not take him to be his friend, by rea&s;on of the many di&s;putes and contradictions frequently between them, he would put his life&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> into his hand to morrow.</Q></P>
<P>IT was not thought rea&s;onable, that M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> &s;hould return into <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King com|municates the di&s;covery to M^r</HI> Mordaunt.</NOTE> <HI>England</HI> with a confidence in this Man; and therefore his Maje&s;ty freely told him all he knew, but not the way by which he knew it, or that he had his very Letters in his own hand, which would quickly have di&s;cover'd how he came by them; <Q>and the King charged him &startq;no farther to communicate with that Per&s;on, and to give his friends &s;uch caution, as might not give a greater di&s;turbance to his Affairs, by rai&s;ing new factions among&s;t them, or provoke him to do more mi&s;|chief,&endq; which it was in his power to do.</Q> But for all this there was ano|ther Expedient found; for by the time M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> return'd to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> the Per&s;on who gave the King the Adverti&s;ement, out of his own wi&s;dom, and knowledge of the ill con&s;equence of that tru&s;t, cau&s;ed Pa|pers

<P>IT was towards the end of <HI>June</HI> that M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> left <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> with a re&s;olution that there &s;hould be a general Rendezvous throughout <HI>Eng|land</HI> of all who would declare for the King, upon a day named, about the middle of <HI>July;</HI> there being Commi&s;&s;ions in every County directed to &s;ix or &s;even known Men, with Authority to them to choo&s;e one to <MILESTONE N="10"> Command in Chief in that County, till they &s;hould make a conjunction with other Forces, who had a &s;uperior Commi&s;&s;ion from the King. And tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners had in their hands plenty of Commi&s;&s;ions under the King's hand, for Regiments and Governments, to di&s;tribute to &s;uch as they judged &s;it to receive them; which was the be&s;t Model (how liable &s;oever to exception) that, in &s;o di&s;tracted a State of Affairs, could be advi&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE King, as is &s;aid, re&s;olv'd at the day appointed to be at <HI>Calais;</HI> which re&s;olution was kept with &s;o great &s;ecrecy at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> that his Ma|je&s;ty had left the Town before it was &s;u&s;pected; and when he was <MILESTONE N="20"> gone, it was as little known whither he was gone; there being as much care taken to have it concealed from being known in <HI>France,</HI> as in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> Therefore, as the King went out in the morning, &s;o the Duke of <HI>York</HI> went out in the afternoon, another way: his Highne&s;s's motion being without any &s;u&s;picion, or notice, by rea&s;on of his Command in the Army. The King went attended by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Calais.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> (who was the Guide, being well acquainted with the Frontiers on both &s;ides) and two or three Servants, all <HI>incognito,</HI> and as Companions; and &s;o they found their way to <HI>Calais;</HI> where they &s;taid.

<P>THE Affairs in <HI>England</HI> had no pro&s;perous a&s;pect; every Po&s;t brought <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Di&s;ap|pointment of all the de&s;igns in</HI> England.</NOTE> News of many Per&s;ons of honour and quality committed to &s;everal Pri|&s;ons, throughout the Kingdom, before the day appointed; which did not terrify the re&s;t. The day it &s;elf was accompanied with very unu&s;ual Weather at that Sea&s;on of the Year, being the middle of <HI>July.</HI> The night before, there had been an exce&s;&s;ive Rain, which continued all the next day, with &s;o terrible a cold high Wind, that the Winter had &s;el|dom <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;o great a Storm: &s;o that the Per&s;ons over <HI>England,</HI> who were drawing to their appointed Rendezvous, were much di&s;mayed, and met with many cro&s;s Accidents; &s;ome mi&s;took the place, and went &s;ome whither el&s;e; others went where they &s;hould be, and were weary of expecting tho&s;e who &s;hould have been there too.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the night, when <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> was going for <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;ey <HI>&s;ei&s;ed on, but e&s;capes</HI></NOTE> a Troop of the Army be&s;et the Hou&s;e where he was, and took him Pri|&s;oner; and putting him before one of the Troopers well guarded, they made ha&s;t to carry him to a place where he might be &s;ecure. But that tempe&s;tuous night had &s;o much of good fortune in it to him, that, in <MILESTONE N="50"> the darke&s;t part of it, the Troop marching down a very &s;teep Hill, with Woods on both &s;ides, he, either by his activity, or the connivance of the Soldier, who was upon the &s;ame Hor&s;e with him, &s;ound means, that,

in the &s;teepe&s;t of the de&s;cent, they both fell from the Hor&s;e, and he di&s;|intangled him&s;elf from the embraces of the other, and being &s;trong and nimble, got into the Woods, and &s;o e&s;caped out of their hands, though his de&s;ign was broken.</P>
<P>OF all the Enterpri&s;es for the &s;ei&s;ing upon &s;trong places, only one &s;ucceeded; which was that undertaken by S^r <HI>George Booth;</HI> all the re&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> G.

The Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> and S^r <HI>Horatio Town&s;end,</HI> and mo&s;t of their Friends, were apprehended before the day, and made Pri&s;oners, mo&s;t of them upon general &s;u&s;picions, as Men able to do hurt. Only S^r <HI>George Booth,</HI> being a Per&s;on of the be&s;t quality and for|tune of that County, of tho&s;e who had never been of the King's party, <MILESTONE N="10"> came into <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> with &s;uch Per&s;ons as he thought fit to take with him, the night before: &s;o that though the tempe&s;tuou&s;ne&s;s of the night, and the next morning, had the &s;ame effect, as in other places, to break or di&s;order the Rendezvous, that was appointed withing four or five miles of that City, yet S^r <HI>George</HI> being him&s;elf there with a good Troop of Hor&s;e he brought with him, and finding others, though not in the num|ber he looked for, he retired with tho&s;e he had into <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> where his Party was &s;trong enough: and S^r <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI> having kept his Rendezvous, came thither to him, and brought &s;trength enough with him to keep tho&s;e parts at their devotion, and to &s;uppre&s;s all there who <MILESTONE N="20"> had inclination to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>THEN they publi&s;hed their Declaration, rather again&s;t tho&s;e who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Decla|ration.</NOTE> call'd them&s;elves the Parliament, and u&s;urped the Government by the power of the Army, than owning directly the King's Intere&s;t. They &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that, &s;ince God had &s;uffer'd the Spirit of divi&s;ion to continue in this Nation, which was left without any &s;ettled foundation of Reli|gion, Liberty, and Property, the Legi&s;lative Power u&s;urped at plea|&s;ure, the Army rai&s;ed for it's defence mi&s;led by their &s;uperiour Offi|cers, and no face of Government remaining, that was lawfully con|&s;tituted; therefore, They, being &s;en&s;ible of their duty, and utter ruin, <MILESTONE N="30"> if the&s;e di&s;tractions &s;hould continue, had taken Arms in vindication of the freedom of Parliaments, of the known Laws, Liberty, and Pro|perty, and of the good People of this Nation groaning under in&s;up|portable Taxes: that they cannot de&s;pair of the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, nor of the chearfull concurrence of all good People, and of the undeceiv'd part of the Army; who&s;e Arrears and future advancement they would&endq; procure,</Q> &s;uffering no impo&s;ition or force on any Man's con&s;cience. But though they mention'd nothing of his Maje&s;ty in expre&s;s terms, they gave all countenance, and reception, and all imaginable a&s;&s;urance to the King's Party; who had directions from the King to concur, and <MILESTONE N="40"> to unite them&s;elves to them.</P>
<P>WHAT di&s;appointments &s;oever there were in other places, the fame of this Action of the&s;e two Gentlemen, rai&s;ed the Spirits of all Men. They who were at liberty, renewed their former de&s;igns; and they who could not promi&s;e them&s;elves places of refuge, prepared them&s;elves to march to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> if S^r <HI>George Booth</HI> did not draw nearer with his Army; which in truth he meant to have done, if the appointments which had been made, had been ob&s;erv'd. But when he heard that all other places failed, and of the multitude of Per&s;ons impri&s;on'd, upon <MILESTONE N="50"> who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he mo&s;t depended, he was in great Apprehen&s;ion that he had begun the work too &s;oon; and though his Numbers increa&s;ed every day, he thought it be&s;t to keep the Po&s;t he was in, till he knew what was like to be done el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P><PB N="527" REF="5370">
THIS fire was kindled in a place which the Parliament lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected; and therefore they were the more alarm'd at the News of it; and knew it would &s;pread far, if it were not quickly quenched; and they had now too &s;oon u&s;e of their Army, in which they had not confidence. There were many Officers whom they had much rather tru&s;t than <HI>Lambert;</HI> but there was none they thought could do their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well: &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment &s;ends</HI> Lambert <HI>a|gain&s;t them</HI></NOTE> they made choice of Him to march with &s;uch Troops as he liked, and with the greate&s;t expedition, to &s;uppre&s;s this new Rebellion, which they &s;aw had many friends. They had formerly &s;ent for two Regiments out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which, they knew, were devoted to the Republican In|tere&s;t, <MILESTONE N="10"> and tho&s;e they appointed <HI>Lambert</HI> to joyn with. He undertook the Charge very willingly, being de&s;irous to renew his credit with the Soldiers, who had loved to be under his Command, becau&s;e, though he was &s;trict in di&s;cipline, he provided well for them, and was him&s;elf e&s;teem'd brave upon any Action. He cared not to take any thing with him that might hinder his march; which he re&s;olv'd &s;hould be very &s;wift, to prevent the increa&s;e of the Enemy in Numbers. And he did make incredible ha&s;t; &s;o that S^r <HI>George Booth</HI> found he was in le&s;s than a day's march, before he thought he could have been half the way. S^r <HI>George</HI> him&s;elf had not been acquainted with the War, and the Offi|cers <MILESTONE N="20"> who were with him, were not of one mind or humour; yet all were de&s;irous to fight (the natural infirmity of the Nation, which could never endure the view of an Enemy without engaging in a Bat|tle) and in&s;tead of retiring into the Town, which they might have de|fended again&s;t a much greater Army than <HI>Lambert</HI> had with him, longer than he could &s;tay before it, they marched to meet him; and were, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Who routs S^r</HI> G. Booth <HI>and takes</HI> Che&s;ter</NOTE> after a &s;hort Encounter, routed by him, and totally broken: &s;o that, the next day, the Gates of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> were open'd to <HI>Lambert;</HI> S^r <HI>George Booth</HI> him&s;elf making his flight in a di&s;gui&s;e; but he was taken upon the way, and &s;ent Pri&s;oner to the Tower. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>LAMBERT pro&s;ecuted the advantage he had got, and marched into North <HI>Wales,</HI> whither S^r <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI> was retired with his Troops to a &s;trong Ca&s;tle of his own; and he thought neither the Man, nor the place, were to be left behind him. It was to no purpo&s;e for one Man to oppo&s;e the whole Kingdom, where all other Per&s;ons appeared &s;ubdued. And therefore, after a day or two making &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance, <HI>Middleton</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Thomas Middleton <HI>de|livers up his ca&s;tle.</HI></NOTE> accepted &s;uch conditions as he could obtain, and &s;uffer'd his goodly Hou&s;e, for the &s;trength of the Situation, to be pulled down.</P>
<P>THIS Succe&s;s put an end to all endeavours of force in <HI>England;</HI> and the Army had nothing to do but to make all Per&s;ons Pri&s;oners who&s;e <MILESTONE N="40"> looks they did not like; &s;o that all Pri&s;ons in <HI>England</HI> were fill'd; whil&s;t the Parliament, exalted with their Conque&s;t, con&s;ulted what Per&s;ons they would execute, and how they &s;hould confi&s;cate the re&s;t; by means whereof, they made no doubt they &s;hould de&s;troy all Seeds of future In&s;urrections on the behalf of the King, many of the Nobility being at pre&s;ent in cu&s;tody. And they re&s;olv'd, if other Evidence was wanting, that the very &s;u&s;pecting them &s;hould be &s;ufficient rea&s;on to continue them there.</P>
<P>WHEN the King came to <HI>Calais,</HI> where he receiv'd Accounts every day from <HI>England</HI> of what was tran&s;acted there, as he was much trou|bled <MILESTONE N="50"> with the News he received daily of the impri&s;onment of his friends, &s;o he was revived with the fame of S^r <HI>George Booth</HI>'s being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and of the Conjunction between him and <HI>Middleton.</HI> They

<P>STRUCK with this di&s;mal relation, the King and his Brother &s;eem'd to have nothing el&s;e to do, but to make what ha&s;t they could out of <HI>France;</HI> where it was thought they could not now be found with &s;afety.

<P>THE Cardinal u&s;ed all the Arguments he could, to di&s;&s;wade her Ma|je&s;ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Argu|ments again&s;t it.</NOTE> from de&s;iring it at this time; <Q>&startq;that it would not be for her Maje&s;ty's Service; nor was he able to bear the reproach, of being the In&s;trument of making a Peace, at a time when <HI>Spain</HI> was reduced to tho&s;e &s;treights, that it could no longer re&s;i&s;t the victorious Armes of <HI>France;</HI> that they could not fail the next Summer of being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> it &s;elf, and then they &s;hould not be long without the re&s;t of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ne|therlands; and therefore, at this time, to propo&s;e a Peace, which mu&s;t <MILESTONE N="40"> di&s;appoint them of &s;o &s;ure a Conque&s;t, would not only be very in|grateful to the Army, but incen&s;e all good <HI>French-</HI>men again&s;t him,&endq; and again&s;t her Maje&s;ty her &s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>THE Queen was not diverted from her purpo&s;e by tho&s;e Arguments; but propo&s;ed it to the King, and pro&s;ecuted it with the Cardinal, that, as him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed to his intimate friends, he was nece&s;&s;itated either to con&s;ent to it, or to have an irreconcilable breach with her Maje&s;ty; which his gratitude would not &s;uffer him to choo&s;e; and thereupon he <NOTE PLACE="marg">But at la&s;t He yields to her purpo&s;e.</NOTE> vielded; and <HI>Don Antonio Pimentel</HI> from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Lyonne</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> &s;o negotiated this la&s;t Winter in both Courts, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Treaty is tran&s;acted fir&s;t</HI> incognito <HI>at</HI> Paris <HI>and</HI> Madrid.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> both, <HI>incognito,</HI> making &s;everal Journies backward and forward, and with that effect, that, by the end of the Winter, it was publi&s;hed, there would be a Treaty between the two Crowns, and that, in the beginning of the

Summer of this year 1659, the two Favourites, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> would meet, and make a Treaty both for the Peace, and the Marriage.</P>
<P>THE Cardinal was the &s;ooner induced to this Peace by the un&s;ettled <NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea&s;ons that moved the Cardinal to yield to this Peace.</NOTE> condition of <HI>England.</HI> The death of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> with whom he had con|certed many things to come, had much perplexed him; yet the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Richard,</HI> under the advice of the &s;ame Per&s;ons who were tru&s;ted by his Father, plea&s;ed him well. But then the throwing him out with &s;uch circum&s;tances, broke all his Mea&s;ures. He could not forget that the Parliament, that now govern'd, were the very &s;ame Men who had <MILESTONE N="10"> eluded all his Application, appear'd ever more inclined to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ide, and had, without any colour of provocation, and when he believ'd they &s;tood fair towards <HI>France,</HI> taken the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, when it could not but have reliev'd <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> by which that Town was deliver'd up to the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> He knew well, that <HI>Spain</HI> did, at that in&s;tant, u&s;e all the underhand means they could to make a Peace with them; and he did not believe, that the Parliament would affect the continuance of that War, at &s;o va&s;t a charge both at Sea and Land; but that they would rather foment the Divi&s;ions in <HI>France,</HI> and endeavour to unite the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> and the Hugonots; which would make a concu&s;&s;ion in <MILESTONE N="20"> that Kingdom; and he &s;hould then have cau&s;e to repent the having put <HI>Dunkirk</HI> into the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The&s;e reflections di&s;turbed him, and di&s;po&s;ed him at la&s;t to believe, that, over and above the benefit of gratifying the Queen, he &s;hould be&s;t provide for the &s;ecurity of <HI>France,</HI> and of Him&s;elf, by making a Peace with <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, he was not &s;o &s;ure of bringing it to pa&s;s, as to provoke, or neglect <HI>England.</HI> Therefore he renew'd all the promi&s;es, he had for|merly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His promi&s;es to</HI> Lockhart <HI>touchin his adhering to the Parlia|ment.</HI></NOTE> made to <HI>Oliver,</HI> <Q>again to <HI>Lockhart</HI> (who was the Emba&s;&s;adour now of the Republick) &startq;that he would never make a Peace without the&endq; con&s;ent, and inclu&s;ion of <HI>England;</HI></Q> and very earne&s;tly de&s;ired him, and <MILESTONE N="30"> writ to that purpo&s;e to the Parliament, that he might be at the Treaty with him, that &s;o they might &s;till con&s;ult what would be be&s;t for their joynt Intere&s;t, from which he would never &s;eparate; in&s;inuating to him, in broken and half Sentences, <Q>&startq;that though the Treaty was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy the Queen, there were &s;o many difficulties in view, that he had&endq; little hope of a Peace:</Q> and, in truth, many &s;ober Men did not believe the Treaty would ever produce a Peace: for, be&s;ides the great Advan|tages which <HI>France</HI> had gotten, and that it could not be imagined, that <HI>Spain</HI> would ever con&s;ent to the relinqui&s;hing all tho&s;e important places to the <HI>French,</HI> which they had then in their hands by Conque&s;t (the <MILESTONE N="40"> u&s;ual Effect of Peace being a re&s;titution of all places taken in the War; which <HI>France</HI> would never permit) there were two particulars which it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two particu|lars of difficul|ty in the Trea|ty referr'd to the per&s;onal conference be|tween the Fa|vourites.</NOTE> was hard to find any Expedient to compo&s;e, and which, notwith&s;tand|ing all the preparations made by <HI>de Lyonne</HI> and <HI>Pimentel,</HI> were entirely re&s;erv'd for the Treaty of the two Favourites; both Sides having, with great ob&s;tinacy, prote&s;ted again&s;t the departing from the re&s;olution they had taken.</P>
<P>THE two particulars were tho&s;e concerning <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t, the bu&s;ine&s;s of</HI> Portugal.</NOTE> of <HI>Cond&egrave;.</HI> There could not be a greater Engagement, than <HI>France</HI> had made to <HI>Portugal,</HI> never to de&s;ert it, nor to make a Peace without pro|viding <MILESTONE N="50"> that that King &s;hould quietly enjoy his Government to him and his Po&s;terity, without being in the lea&s;t degree &s;ubject to the Yoke of <HI>Spain.</HI> And <HI>Spain</HI> was principally induced to buy a Peace upon hard

<P>ON the other hand, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s word <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;econd, that of the Prince of</HI> Conde</NOTE> and obligation, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn Treaty that could be enter'd into, that he would never conclude a Peace without including Him, and all who adhered to him, not only to a full re&s;titution to their Honours, Offices, and E&s;tates, but with &s;ome farther recompence for the great Service he had done; which was very great indeed: and no body be|lieved, <MILESTONE N="10"> that the Cardinal would ever con&s;ent to the re&s;toration of that Prince, who had wrought him &s;o many calamities, and brought him to the brink of de&s;truction. With the&s;e ill pre&s;ages, great preparations were made for this Treaty, and the time and the place were agreed on, when, and where the two great Favourites &s;hould meet. <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fuentarabia <HI>the place of Interview.</HI></NOTE> a place in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions, very near the Borders of <HI>France,</HI> the &s;ame place where <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t was deliver'd, after his long impri|&s;onment in <HI>Spain,</HI> was agreed upon for their interview; a little River near that place parting both the Kingdoms; and a little building of boards over it, brought the two Favourites to meet, without either of <MILESTONE N="20"> their going out of his Ma&s;ter's Dominions.</P>
<P>THE fame of this Treaty, a&s;&s;oon as it was agreed to, had yielded va|riety, and new Matter to the King to con&s;ider. Both Crowns had made the contention and War that was between them, the only ground and rea&s;on, why they did not give him that A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which in a ca&s;e &s;o nearly relating to them&s;elves, he might well expect; and both had made many profe&s;&s;ions, that, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to relea&s;e them from that War, they would manife&s;t to the world, that they took the King's ca&s;e to be their own: &s;o that his Maje&s;ty might very rea|&s;onably promi&s;e him&s;elf &s;ome advantage and benefit from this Peace, <MILESTONE N="30"> and the world could not but expect, that he would have &s;ome Emba&s;&s;a|dour pre&s;ent to &s;ollicite on his behalf. There were &s;o many difficulties to find a fit Per&s;on, and &s;o many greater to defray the expence of an Emba&s;&s;adour, that his Maje&s;ty had at fir&s;t re&s;olv'd to find him&s;elf pre|&s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|&s;olves to be pre&s;ent at is</NOTE> in that Treaty; which re&s;olution he kept very private, though he was &s;hortly after confirm'd in it by a Letter from S^r <HI>Harry Bennet;</HI> by which he was inform'd, <Q>&startq;that he &s;peaking with <HI>Don Lewis</HI> about his Journey to <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> and asking him whether he would give him leave to wait on him thither, <HI>Don Lewis</HI> an&s;wer'd, that he &s;hould do well to be pre&s;ent; and then asked him, why the King him&s;elf would <MILESTONE N="40"> not be there; and two or three days after, he told him, that if the King, with a very light train, came <HI>incognito</HI> thither, for the place could not permit them to receive him in State, after the great diffi|culties of the Treaty were over, he would do all he could to induce the Cardinal co concur in what might be of convenience to his Maje|&s;ty.&endq;</Q> The King had before re&s;olv'd to have a very little train with him, &s;uitable to the trea&s;ure he had to defray his expences, and to make his whole Journey <HI>incognito,</HI> and not to be known in any place through which he was to pa&s;s. But he was troubled what he was to do with re|ference to <HI>France,</HI> through which he was nece&s;&s;arily to make his Jour|ney. <MILESTONE N="50"> How much <HI>incognito</HI> &s;oever he meant to travail, it might be ne|ce&s;&s;ary again&s;t any accident to have a Pa&s;s; yet to ask one, and be re|fu&s;ed, would be wor&s;e than going without one. Though he expected
<PB N="532" REF="5420">
much le&s;s from the Nature of the Cardinal, than from the &s;incerity of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> yet the former was able to do him much more good than the latter; and therefore care was to be taken that he might have no cau&s;e to find him&s;elf neglected, and that more depending upon <HI>Spain</HI> might not irreconcile <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>TO extricate him&s;elf out of the&s;e perplexities, his Maje&s;ty had writ|ten to the Queen his Mother, to intreat her, <Q>&startq;as of her &s;elf, to de&s;ire the Cardinal's advice, whether it would not be fit for the King to be pre&s;ent at the Treaty; that &s;he might &s;end his Maje&s;ty &s;uch coun&s;el as was proper: if he thought well of it, &s;he might then propo&s;e &s;uch Pa&s;&s;es,&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> as &s;hould &s;eem rea&s;onable to her.</Q> Her Maje&s;ty accordingly took an op|portunity to ask the Que&s;tion of the Cardinal; who, at the very motion, told her very warmly, <Q>&startq;that it was by no means fit; and that it would&endq; do the King much harm;</Q> <Q>and afterwards, recollecting him&s;elf, he wi&s;h'd the Queen &startq;to let the King know, that he &s;hould rely upon him to take <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cardinal</HI> Ma|zarin <HI>advi&s;es again&s;t it.</HI></NOTE> care of what concern'd him; which he would not fail to do, a&s;&s;oon as&endq; he di&s;cern'd that the Treaty would produce a Peace.</Q> Her Maje&s;ty ac|quie&s;ced with this profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ent the King word, how kind the Cardinal was to him; but would by no means that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould think of undertaking &s;uch a journey him&s;elf; nor did the Queen ima|gine <MILESTONE N="20"> that the King would ever think of it without a Pa&s;s, and the Car|dinal's approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN his Maje&s;ty had received this Account from his Mother, he &s;aw it was to no purpo&s;e to think of a Pa&s;s. And thus far, in the begin|ning of this la&s;t Spring, before any de&s;ign of ri&s;ing in <HI>England</HI> was ri|pened, his Maje&s;ty had proceeded in his intention of being per&s;onally pre&s;ent at the Conference between the two great Mini&s;ters. But now, when all his expectations from <HI>England</HI> for this year were defeated, and when he him&s;elf was already advanced far into <HI>France,</HI> he thought it more nece&s;&s;ary than ever to take up his former re&s;olution. Being <MILESTONE N="30"> therefore by this time fully adverti&s;ed, that the Favourites had been met a con&s;iderable time, and were enter'd &s;o far into the Treaty, in the very entrance of which they had agreed to a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, his Maje&s;ty attended by the &s;ame Company he had then with him, the Marquis of <HI>Ormond, Daniel O Neile,</HI> and two or three other Servants, together with the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> (though S^r <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> had before informed the King, that <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> had particularly de&s;ired he would not bring that Earl with him; who&s;e Company yet, in re|&s;pect of his Language, the King believ'd would be very convenient to him) his Maje&s;ty, I &s;ay, with this Attendance, began his journey from <MILESTONE N="40"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King be|gins his jour|ney thither with the Mar|quis of</HI> Or|mond, <HI>and the Earl of</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> that part of <HI>Bretagne</HI> where he then was &s;till <HI>incognito.</HI> He had indeed now more rea&s;on than ever to conceal him&s;elf in his journey, and really to apprehend being &s;topp'd if he were di&s;cover'd; and therefore was not to go about by <HI>Paris,</HI> or any of tho&s;e roads where he had been hereto fore known; yet he allowed him&s;elf the more time, that he might in his compa&s;s &s;ee tho&s;e parts of <HI>France</HI> where he had never been before, and indeed give him&s;elf all the plea&s;ure, and diverti&s;ement, that &s;uch a journey would admit of. To that purpo&s;e he appointed the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to be the Guide; who knew mo&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> at lea&s;t more than any body el&s;e did; and who allways delighted to go out of the way; and <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Daniel O Neile</HI> to take care that they allways fared well in their Lodgings; for which Province no Man was fitter. Thus they wheeled about by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes by</HI> Lyons <HI>into</HI> Languedoc; <HI>and &s;o on|ward.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lyons</HI> into <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and were &s;o well plea&s;ed with the varieties in
<PB N="533" REF="5430">
the journey, that they not enough remember'd the end of it, taking their information of the Progre&s;s in the Treaty from the Intelligence they met with in the way.</P>
<P>WHEN they came near <HI>Toulou&s;e,</HI> they found that the <HI>French</HI> Court was there, which they purpo&s;ely de&s;ign'd to decline. However the King, going him&s;elf a nearer way, &s;ent the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> thither, to in|form him&s;elf of the true State of the Treaty, and to meet his Maje&s;ty again at a place appointed, that was the direct way to <HI>Fuentarabia.</HI> The Marquis went alone without a Servant, that he might be the le&s;s &s;u&s;pected; and when he came to <HI>Toulou&s;e,</HI> he was inform'd from the <MILESTONE N="10"> Common di&s;cour&s;e of the Court, that the Treaty was upon the matter concluded, and that the Cardinal was expected there within le&s;s than a week.</P>
<P>IT was very true, all matters of difficulty were over in le&s;s time than <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the Clo&s;e of that Treaty in re&s;pect of the difficulties con|cerning</HI> Por|tugal <HI>and the Prince of</HI> Conde</NOTE> was conceiv'd po&s;&s;ible, both Parties equally de&s;iring the Marriage, which could never be without the Peace. The Cardinal, who had much the advantage over <HI>Don Lewis</HI> in all the faculties nece&s;&s;ary for a Treaty, excepting probity and punctuality in ob&s;erving what he promi&s;ed, had u&s;ed all the Arts imaginable to induce <HI>Don Lewis</HI> to yield both in the point of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and what related to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and his <MILESTONE N="20"> Party. <Q>He enlarged upon &startq;the de&s;perate e&s;tate in which <HI>Flanders</HI> was; and that they could po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves entirely of it in one Campagne; and therefore it might ea&s;ily be concluded, that nothing but the Queen's ab&s;olute Authority, could in &s;uch a conjuncture have di&s;po&s;ed the King to a Treaty; and, he hoped, that &s;he &s;hould not be &s;o ill re|quited, as to be obliged to break the Treaty, or to oblige the King her Son to con&s;ent to what was indi&s;pen&s;ably again&s;t his honour: that if he &s;hould recede from the Intere&s;t of <HI>Portugal,</HI> no Prince or State would hereafter enter into Alliance with him: that though they were bound to in&s;i&s;t to have <HI>Portugal</HI> included in the Peace, yet he would be contented that a long Truce might be made, and all Acts of Ho&s;ti|lity <MILESTONE N="30"> forborne for a good Number of years, which, he &s;aid, was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for <HI>Spain,</HI> that they might recover the fatigue of the long War they had &s;u&s;tain'd, before they enter'd into a New One: if they would not con&s;ent to that, then that <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;hould be left out of the Peace, and <HI>Spain</HI> at liberty to pro&s;ecute the War, and <HI>France</HI> at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Portugal,</HI> which, he &s;aid, in re&s;pect of the di&s;tance, they &s;hould never be able to admini&s;ter in &s;uch a proportion as would be able to pre&s;erve it from their Conque&s;t; not without in&s;inuation, that, &s;o they might not renounce the promi&s;e they had made, they <MILESTONE N="40"> would not be over&s;ollicitous to perform it. As to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> that the Catholick King was now to look upon <HI>France</HI> as the Domi|nion of his Son in Law, and to be inherited by his Grand&s;on, and therefore he would con&s;ider what peril it might bring to both, if the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> were re&s;tored to his greatne&s;s in that Kingdom, who only could di&s;turb the Peace of it, and who&s;e ambition was &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, that they could no longer enjoy Peace, than whil&s;t he was not in a&endq; condition to interrupt it.</Q> The Cardinal told him, in confidence, of &s;everal Indignities offer'd by the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> to the Per&s;on of the Queen, of which her Brother ought to be very &s;en&s;ible, and which <MILESTONE N="50"> would ab&s;olve him from any Engagement he had enter'd into with that Prince; which he would never have done, if his Maje&s;ty had been fully inform'd of tho&s;e rude tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.

<P>DON <HI>Lewis de Haro</HI> was a Man of great temper, of a &s;allow com|plection, <MILESTONE N="10"> Hypocondriac, and never weary of hearing; thought well of what he was to &s;ay; what he wanted in acutene&s;s he made up in wa|rine&s;s; and though he might omit the &s;aying &s;omewhat he had a good occa&s;ion to &s;ay, he never &s;aid any thing of which he had occa&s;ion to re|pent.

WHEN the Cardinal found that all his Art, and crafty Eloquence, were lo&s;t upon <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s want of Politene&s;s; and that he could not bend him in the lea&s;t degree in either of the&s;e important particulars, he re&s;olv'd they &s;hould pay otherwi&s;e for their Idol Honour, and Pun|ctuality; and after he had brought him to con&s;ent to the detention of all the places they had taken, as well in <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> as <HI>Flanders,</HI> and all other Provinces, by which they di&s;member'd all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Domi|nions in tho&s;e parts, and kept them&s;elves nearer Neighbours to the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> than the other de&s;ired they &s;hould be, he compelled them, <MILESTONE N="10"> though a thing very foreign to the Treaty, to deliver the Town of <HI>Ju|liers</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> without the payment of any Money for what they had laid out upon the Fortifications; which they could otherwi&s;e claim. It is very true, that Town did belong of right to the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> as part of the Duchy of <HI>Juliers,</HI> which was de|&s;cended to him. But it is as true, that it was pre&s;erv'd by <HI>Spain,</HI> from being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> many years before, and by Treaty to remain in their hands, till they &s;hould receive &s;atisfaction for all their disbur&s;ements. After which time, they erected the Citadel there, and much mended the Fortifications. And this dependence, and expecta|tion, <MILESTONE N="20"> had kept that Prince fa&s;t to all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>Germany:</HI> whereas, by the wre&s;ting it now out of their hands, and frankly giving it up to the true Owner, they got the entire devotion of the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o a new friend to &s;trengthen their Alliance upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which was before inconvenient enough to <HI>Spain,</HI> by &s;topping the re&s;ort of any <HI>German</HI> Succours into <HI>Flanders.</HI> And if, at any time to come, the <HI>French</HI> &s;hall purcha&s;e <HI>Juliers</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> as upon many Accidents he may be induced to part with it, they will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t advantageous Po&s;t to facilitate their enterpri&s;es upon <HI>Liege,</HI> or <HI>Cologne,</HI> or to di&s;turb the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> or to &s;ei&s;e upon <HI>Aqui&s;grane,</HI> an Imperial Town; and, in|deed, to di&s;turb the Peace of <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P><Q>OF <HI>Portugal</HI> no other care was taken in the Treaty, than that after the <HI>French</HI> King had pompou&s;ly declared, &startq;he would have given up all his Conque&s;ts by the War, provided the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would have con&s;ented that all things &s;hould remain in <HI>Portugal</HI> as they were at that&endq; pre&s;ent (which Propo&s;ition,</Q> <Q>twas &s;aid, his Catholick Maje&s;ty had ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed) now &startq;the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;hould be allow'd three Months time, counting from the day of the Ratification of the Treaty, wherein he might try to di&s;po&s;e the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> to &s;atisfy his Catho|lick <MILESTONE N="40"> Maje&s;ty. But after tho&s;e three Months &s;hould be expired, if his good offices &s;hould not produce the effect de&s;ired, then neither his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty nor his Succe&s;&s;ours &s;hould give the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> any aid or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, publickly or &s;ecretly, directly or indirectly, by&endq; Sea or Land, or in any other manner what&s;oever.</Q> And this the in|genuity of the Cardinal thought could never be called renouncing of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>To the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> all things were yielded which had been in|&s;i&s;ted on; and full recompence made to &s;uch of his Party as could not be re&s;tored to their Offices; as Pre&s;ident <HI>Viole,</HI> and &s;ome others: yet <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> would not &s;ign the Treaty, till he had &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> to inform him of all the particulars, and had re|ceiv'd his full approbation. And even then, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> cau&s;ed a great Sum of Money to be paid to him, that he might di&s;charge all the
<PB N="536" REF="5460">
debts which he had contracted in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and reward his Officers, who were to be disbanded; a Method <HI>France</HI> did not u&s;e at the &s;ame time to their Pro&s;elytes, but left <HI>Catalonia</HI> to their King's Cha&s;ti&s;ement, without any provi&s;ion made for <HI>Don Jo&s;epho de Margarita,</HI> and others, who had been the principal Contrivers of tho&s;e di&s;turbances; and were left to eat the bread of <HI>France;</HI> where it is admini&s;ter'd to them very &s;paringly, without any hope of ever &s;eeing their Native Country again, except they make their way thither by fomenting a new Rebellion.</P>
<P>WHEN all things were concluded, and the Engro&s;&s;ments preparing, the Cardinal came one morning into <HI>Don Lewis</HI> his Chamber with a &s;ad <MILESTONE N="10"> Countenance; and told him, <Q>&startq;they had lo&s;t all their pains, and the&endq; Peace could not be concluded.</Q> <Q>At which <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> in much di&s;tur|bance, asked, &startq;&endq;what the matter was?</Q> the Cardinal very compo&s;edly an|&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that it mu&s;t not be; that they two were too good Catholicks to do any thing again&s;t the Pope's infallibility, which would be called in que&s;tion by this Peace; &s;ince his Holyne&s;s had declared, that there&endq; would be no Peace made;</Q> as indeed he had done, after he had, from the fir&s;t hour of his Pontificate, labour'd it for many years, and found him&s;elf &s;till deluded by the Cardinal, who had yet promi&s;ed him, that, when the Sea&s;on was ripe for it, he &s;hould have the &s;ole power to con|clude <MILESTONE N="20"> it; &s;o that when he heard that the two Favourites were to meet, of which he had no Notice, he &s;aid in the Con&s;i&s;tory, <Q>&startq;that he was &s;ure&endq; that Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> would not make a Peace.</Q> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was glad that there was no other objection again&s;t it; and &s;o all the Company made them&s;elves merry at the Pope's charge.</P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> di&s;cover'd by the information he receiv'd at <HI>Toulou&s;e,</HI> that the Treaty was &s;o near an end, he made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to the place the King had appointed to meet at, that his Maje&s;ty might lo&s;e no more time. When he came thither, he found no body; which he imputed to the u&s;ual delays in their journey; and <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;tayed one whole day in expectation of them; but then concluded that they were gone forward &s;ome other way, and &s;o thought it his bu&s;ine&s;s to ha&s;ten to <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> where he heard nothing of the King. S^r <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> was in great perplexity, and complain'd, very rea&s;onably, that the King neglected his own bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch a conjuncture, the benefit whereof was lo&s;t by his not coming. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> &s;eem'd to wonder, that the King had not come thither, whil&s;t the Cardinal and He were toge|ther. The Treaty was now concluded; and though the Cardinal remain'd &s;till at his old Quarters on the <HI>French</HI> &s;ide, under &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition of the Gout, yet He and <HI>Don Lewis</HI> were to meet no more. But <HI>Don</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Lewis</HI> was the le&s;s troubled that the King had not come &s;ooner, becau&s;e he had found the Cardinal, as often as he had taken occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the King, very cold, and re&s;erv'd; and he had magnified the power of the Parliament, and &s;eem'd to think his Maje&s;ty's hopes de&s;perate; and advi&s;ed <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> <Q>&startq;to be wary how he embarked him&s;elf in an Affair that had no foundation; and that it was rather time for all Ca|tholicks to unite to the breaking the power and intere&s;t of the Here|tical Party, wherever it was, than to &s;trengthen it by re&s;toring the&endq; King, except He would become Catholick.</Q> And it is believ'd by Wi&s;e Men, that, in that Treaty, &s;omewhat was agreed to the prejudice of <MILESTONE N="50"> the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; and that, in a &s;hort time, there would have been much done again&s;t it both in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> if the mea|&s;ures they had there taken had not been &s;hortly broken; chiefly by the
<PB N="537" REF="5470">
&s;urpri&s;ing Revolution in <HI>England</HI> (which happen'd the next year) and al&s;o by the death of the two great Favourites of the two Crowns, <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Mazarin;</HI> who both died not very long after it; the Cardinal, probably, &s;truck with the wonder, if not the agony of that undream'd of pro&s;perity of our King's Affairs; as if he had taken it ill, and laid it to heart, that God Almighty would bring &s;uch a work to pa&s;s in <HI>Europe,</HI> without his concurrence, and even again&s;t all his Machinations.</P>
<P>DURING the whole time of the Treaty, <HI>Lockhart</HI> had been at <HI>Bayonne,</HI> and frequently con&s;ulted with the Cardinal, and was by him brought to <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> twice or thrice, where they &s;poke of the mutual benefit that would redound to both, if a Peace were &s;ettled between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> But the Cardinal treated <HI>Lockhart</HI> (who was in all other oc|ca&s;ions too hard for him) in &s;uch a manner, that, till the Peace was upon the matter concluded, he did really believe it would not be made (as appear'd by &s;ome of his Letters from <HI>Bayonne,</HI> which fell into the King's hands) and to the la&s;t he was per&s;waded, that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be com|prehended in it, in terms to its &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THE King, the next day after he had &s;ent the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> to <HI>Toulou&s;e,</HI> receiv'd information upon the way, that the Treaty was <MILESTONE N="20"> ab&s;olutely ended, and that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was return'd to <HI>Madrid;</HI> to which giving credit, he concluded, that it would be to no purpo&s;e to pro&s;ecute his journey to <HI>Fuentarabia;</HI> and therefore was ea&s;ily per|&s;waded by the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to take the neare&s;t way to <HI>Madrid,</HI> by entring into <HI>Spain</HI> a&s;&s;oon as they could; pre&s;uming that the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> would quickly conclude whither they were gone, and follow his Maje&s;ty. With this re&s;olution, and upon this Intelligence, they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King by mi&s;take went into</HI> Spain <HI>as far as to</HI> Sa|rago&s;a.</NOTE> continued their journey till they came to <HI>Sarago&s;a,</HI> the Metropolis of the Kingdom of <HI>Aragon.</HI> Here they receiv'd Adverti&s;ement, that the Treaty was not fully concluded, and that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> remain'd &s;till at <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Fuentarabia.</HI> This was a new perplexity: at la&s;t they re&s;olv'd, that the King, and the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who had &s;till a mind to <HI>Madrid,</HI> &s;hould &s;tay at <HI>Sarago&s;a,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>O Neile</HI> &s;hould go to <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> and return with direction what cour&s;e they were to &s;teer.</P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> were in great confu&s;ion with the apprehen&s;ion that &s;ome ill Accident had befallen the King, when M^r <HI>O Neile</HI> arriv'd, and inform'd them by what accident, and mi&s;|intelligence, the King had re&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Madrid,</HI> if he had not been better inform'd at <HI>Sarago&s;a;</HI> where he now remain'd, till he &s;hould re|ceive farther advice. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was in all the di&s;turbance imaginable, <MILESTONE N="40"> when he heard the relation: he concluded that this was a trick of the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>'s; that he held &s;ome Intelligence with <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and intended to carry the King to <HI>Madrid,</HI> whil&s;t he was ab&s;ent, with a purpo&s;e to affront him, and in hope to tran&s;act &s;omewhat without his Privity. They were now to &s;ave, and to borrow all the Money they could, to defray the Expences which mu&s;t be &s;hortly made for the In|terview, Marriage, and delivery of the Infanta, and all this mu&s;t be &s;pent upon the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Entry, and Entertainment in <HI>Ma|drid;</HI> for a King <HI>incognito</HI> was never heard of in <HI>Spain.</HI> The Marriage was concluded, and now another young unmarried King mu&s;t be re|ceiv'd, <MILESTONE N="50"> and care&s;&s;ed in that Court; which would occa&s;ion much di&s;cour&s;e both in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> All the&s;e things his melancholy had made him revolve; nor did he conceal the trouble he endured, from the Mar|quis
<PB N="538" REF="5480">
of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and S^r <HI>Harry Bennet;</HI> <Q>who a&s;&s;ured him, &startq;that all that was pa&s;t was by meer mi&s;take, and without any purpo&s;e to decline&endq; Him, upon who&s;e friend&s;hip alone the King ab&s;olutely depended;</Q> and undertook po&s;itively, <Q>&startq;that a&s;&s;oon as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be inform'd of his advice, he would make all the ha&s;t thither he could, without thought&endq; of doing any thing el&s;e:</Q> which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> de&s;ired might be effected a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible.

<P>THE King was receiv'd according to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode and Genero|&s;ity, and treated with the &s;ame re&s;pect and reverence that could be <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hew'd to his Catholick Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, if he had been in that place. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> deliver'd all that could be &s;aid from the King, his Ma&s;ter; <Q>&startq;how much he was troubled, that the condition of his Affairs, and the nece&s;&s;ity that was upon him to make &s;hortly a long journey, would not permit him to invite his Maje&s;ty to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and to treat him in that manner that was &s;uitable to his Grandeur: that having happily concluded the Peace, he had now nothing &s;o much in his thoughts, as how he might be able to give, or procure &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as his Ma|je&s;ty &s;tood in need of; and that he &s;hould never be de&s;titute of any&endq; thing, that His power and intere&s;t could help him to.</Q> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> for <MILESTONE N="20"> him&s;elf made all tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, which could po&s;&s;ibly be expected from him. <Q>He confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that there was no provi&s;ion made in the Treaty that the two Crowns would jointly a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty; but, that he believ'd the Cardinal would be ready to perform all good Of|fices towards him; and that, for his own particular, his Maje&s;ty &s;hould receive good te&s;timony of the profound veneration he had for&endq; him.</Q></P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis</HI> intimated a Wi&s;h, that his Maje&s;ty could yet have &s;ome conference with the Cardinal; who was, as is &s;aid, &s;till within di&s;tance. Whereupon the King &s;ent the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> to vi&s;it him, and to <MILESTONE N="30"> let him know, that his Maje&s;ty had a de&s;ire to come to him, that he might have &s;ome conference with him, and receive his coun&s;el and ad|vice. But the Cardinal would by no means admit it; <Q>&s;aid, &startq;it would admini&s;ter un&s;ea&s;onable jealou&s;y to the Parliament, without any man|ner&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cardinal would not &s;ee the King</NOTE> of benefit to the King.</Q> He made many large profe&s;&s;ions, which he could do well, of his Affection to the King; <Q>de&s;ired, &startq;he would have patience till the Marriage &s;hould be over, which would be in the next Spring; and till then their Maje&s;ties mu&s;t remain in tho&s;e parts: but, a&s;&s;oon as that &s;hould be di&s;patched, the whole Court would return to <HI>Paris;</HI> and that he would not be long there, before he gave the King&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ome evidence of his kindne&s;s and re&s;pect:</Q> other an&s;wer than this the Marquis could not obtain.</P>
<P>AFTER his Maje&s;ty had &s;tayed as long as he thought convenient at <HI>Fuentarabia</HI> (for he knew well that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was to return to <HI>Ma|drid</HI> before the King of <HI>Spain</HI> could take any re&s;olution to begin, or order his own journey, and that he &s;tayed there only to entertain his Maje&s;ty) he di&s;cern'd that he had nothing more to do than to return to <HI>Flanders;</HI> where, he was a&s;&s;ured, his reception &s;hould be better than it had been. So he declared his re&s;olution to begin his return on &s;uch a day. In the &s;hort time of his &s;tay there, the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> according <MILESTONE N="50"> to his excellent talent, which &s;eldom failed him in any exigent, from as great a prejudice as could attend any Man, had wrought him&s;elf &s;o

much into the good graces of all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was willing to take him with him to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that he &s;hould be re|ceived into the Service of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, in &s;uch a Province as &s;hould be worthy of him. So that his Maje&s;ty had now a le&s;s Train to return with, the Marquis of <HI>Ormond, Daniel O Neile,</HI> and two or three Servants.</P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis,</HI> with a million of excu&s;es that their expences had been &s;o great, as had wa&s;ted all their Money, pre&s;ented his Maje&s;ty with &s;even thou&s;and gold Pi&s;toles, <Q>&startq;to defray, as he &s;aid, the expences of his&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> journey, with a&s;&s;urance,</Q> <Q>&startq;that, when he came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he &s;hould find all nece&s;&s;ary Orders for his better accommodation, and&endq; carrying on his bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q> So his Maje&s;ty begun his journey, and took <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's re|turn towards</HI> Flanders <HI>by</HI> Paris.</NOTE> <HI>Paris</HI> in his way to vi&s;it the Queen his Mother, with whom a good un|der&s;tanding was made upon removing all former mi&s;takes; and, towards the end of <HI>December,</HI> he return'd to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> in good health; where he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He came to</HI> Bru&s;&s;els <HI>about the end of</HI> De|cember.</NOTE> found his two Brothers, the Dukes of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> impatiently expecting him.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ure and variety of his journey, and the very civil treat|ment he had receiv'd from <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> with the good di&s;po&s;ition he had <MILESTONE N="20"> left the Queen his Mother in, had very much revived and refre&s;hed the King's Spirit, and the joy for his return di&s;per&s;ed the pre&s;ent Clouds. But he had not been long at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> before he di&s;cern'd the &s;ame me|lancholy and de&s;pair in the Countenances of mo&s;t Men, which he had left there: and though there had &s;ome Changes happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> which might rea&s;onably encourage Men to look for greater, they had &s;o often been di&s;appointed in tho&s;e Expectations, that it was a reproach to any Man to think that any good could come from thence.</P>
<P>UPON this melancholic conjuncture &s;ome about the King began to think of providing a Religion, as well as other conveniences, that might <MILESTONE N="30"> be grateful to tho&s;e People and Places, where, and with whom they were like to re&s;ide. The Prote&s;tant Religion was found to be very unagreea|ble to their fortune, and they exerci&s;ed their thoughts mo&s;t how to get hand&s;omely from it; and if it had not been for the King's own &s;teadi|ne&s;s, of which he gave great indications, Men would have been more out of countenance to have owned the faith they were of; and many made little doubt, but that it would &s;hortly be very manife&s;t to the King, that his Re&s;toration depended wholely upon a conjunction of Catho|lick Princes, who could never be united, but on the behalf of Catholick Religion.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t the King could now look for, &s;eem'd to be a permi&s;&s;ion to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The all &s;tate of his Maje&s;ty's Affairs there.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> remain in <HI>Flanders,</HI> with a narrow a&s;&s;ignation for his bread, which was a melancholic condition for a King; nor could That be depended upon; for there were &s;ecret approaches made, both from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> towards a Peace; and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had great rea&s;on to de&s;ire it, that he might meet with no ob&s;truction in his intended Conque&s;t of <HI>Portugal.</HI> And what influence any Peace might have upon his Maje|&s;ty's quiet, might rea&s;onably be apprehended. However, there being no War in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> could no longer re|main in an unactive cour&s;e of Life; and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had a great <MILESTONE N="50"> family, impatient to be where they might enjoy plenty, and where they might be ab&s;ent from the King.

This bounty of his, was quickly known to the Parliament; which concluded, that he in|tended <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment grow|$ealous of</HI> Lambert <HI>Army</HI></NOTE> to make a Party in the Army, that &s;hould more depend upon <MILESTONE N="10"> Him than upon Them.

<P>LAMBERT, in&s;tead of making ha&s;t to them, found &s;ome delays in his march (as if all were not &s;afe) to &s;ei&s;e upon the Per&s;ons of Delin|quents.

He fore&s;aw what His portion then mu&s;t be, and that all the Ill he had done towards them would be remember'd, and the Good forgotten. He there|fore contrived a Petition, which was &s;ign'd by the inferior Officers of his Army; in which they de&s;ired the Parliament, <Q>&startq;that they might be <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Petition and Propo&s;als of</HI> Lambert <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> govern'd, as all Armies u&s;ed to be, by a General, who might be among&s;t them, and other Officers, according to their Qualities, &s;ubordinate to&endq; him.</Q> The Addre&s;s was intituled, <HI>The humble Petition and Propo&s;als</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>of the Army, under the Command of the Lord Lambert, in the late Northern Expedition.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THEY made a large recapitulation of &startq;the many Services they had done, which they thought were forgotten; and that now lately they had pre&s;erv'd them from an Enemy, which, if they had been &s;uffer'd to grow, would, in a &s;hort time, have overrun the Kingdom, and en|gaged the Nation in a new bloody War; to which too many Men were&endq; &s;till inclined;</Q> and concluded with a de&s;ire, <Q>&startq;that they would commit the Army to <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> as General; and that they would appoint <HI>Lam|bert&endq;</HI> to be Major General.</Q> <HI>Fleetwood</HI> was a weak Man, but very po|pular <MILESTONE N="40"> with all the praying part of the Army; a Man, whom the Par|liament would have tru&s;ted, if they had not re&s;olv'd to have no Gene|ral, being as confident of his fidelity to them, as of any Man's; and <HI>Lambert</HI> knew well he could govern him, as <HI>Cromwell</HI> had done <HI>Fair|fax,</HI> and then in the like manner lay him a&s;ide. This Petition was &s;ent by &s;ome tru&s;ty Per&s;on to &s;ome Colonels of the Army, in whom <HI>Lam|bert</HI> had confidence, to the end that they &s;hould deliver it to <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> to be by him pre&s;ented fir&s;t to the Council of Officers, and afterwards to the Parliament.

<P>THIS put the whole Army into that di&s;temper, that <HI>Lambert</HI> could wi&s;h it in; and brought the Council of Officers to meet again more avowedly, than they had done &s;ince the reviving of the Parliament. <MILESTONE N="10"> They prepared and pre&s;ented a Petition and Repre&s;entation to the Par|liament; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Council of Officers upon this prepare a a Petition, and Repre|&s;entation to the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> <Q>in which they gave them many good words, and a&s;&s;ured them of &startq;their fidelity towards them; but yet that they would &s;o far take care for their own pre&s;ervation, that they would not be at the Mercy&endq; of their Enemies;</Q> and implied, that they having no way forfeited their Rights of Freemen, had likewi&s;e Privileges, which they would not quit; and then &s;econded the propo&s;als of the Northern Brigade with more warmth, and de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;that whatever Per&s;ons &s;hould for the future groundle&s;ly inform the Parliament again&s;t them, creating jealou&s;ies, and <MILESTONE N="20"> ca&s;ting &s;candalous imputations upon them, may be brought to exami|nation,&endq; ju&s;tice, and condign puni&s;hment.</Q></P>
<P>THE Parliament, that was govern'd by <HI>Vane,</HI> and <HI>Ha&s;lerig</HI> (the Heads of the Republick Party, though of very different Natures, and Under&s;tandings) found there would be no compounding this di&s;pute amicably, but that one Side mu&s;t be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. They re&s;olv'd there|fore to take away all hope of Sub&s;i&s;tence from the Army, if they &s;hould be inclined to make any alteration in the Government by force. <Q>In order thereunto they declared, &startq;that it &s;hould be Trea&s;on in any Per&s;on <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment declare it Trea&s;on to rai&s;e Money without con|&s;ent of Parlia|ment; and make void all Money-Acts.

Upon which <HI>Lambert</HI> rode to the Captain, and pulled him off his Hor&s;e; and bid Major <HI>Creed,</HI> who had formerly Commanded <MILESTONE N="20"> that Troop, to mount into his Saddle; which he pre&s;ently did. Then he took away the Mace, and bid Major <HI>Creed</HI> conduct M^r <HI>Lenthal</HI> to his Hou&s;e. Whereupon they made his Coach-man turn, and without the lea&s;t contradiction the Troop march'd very quietly, till he was alighted at his own Hou&s;e; and then di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elves as their new Captain commanded them.</P>

<P><Q>WHEREUPON the Officers of the Army meet together and declare, <MILESTONE N="40"> &startq;that the Army finding it &s;elf without a General, or other general Of|ficers, had Them&s;elves made choice of <HI>Fleetwood</HI> to be their General, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Officers meet, and choo&s;e</HI> Fleet|wood <HI>General</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> and of <HI>Lambert</HI> to be their Major General, and of <HI>Desborough</HI> to be Commi&s;&s;ary General of the Hor&s;e; and that they bound them&s;elves to obey them in their &s;everal Capacities, and to adhere to, and defend&endq; them.</Q> Upon the publi&s;hing this Declaration, they a&s;&s;um'd their &s;e|veral Provinces; and the whole Army took Commi&s;&s;ions from their new General; and were as much united, as if they were under <HI>Crom|well;</HI> and look'd upon it as a great deliverance, that they &s;hould no more be &s;ubject to the Parliament; which they all dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e Generals were not at ea&s;e; they knew well upon what <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;lippery ground they &s;tood: the Parliament had &s;topped all the Chan|nels in which the Revenue was to run; put an end to all payments of Cu&s;tom and Exci&s;e; and to revive the&s;e Impo&s;itions, by which the

Army might receive their Wages, required another Authority than of the Army it &s;elf. The divi&s;ions in the Parliament, had made the out|rage that was committed upon it le&s;s reproachful. <HI>Vane,</HI> who was much <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vane<HI>'s and</HI> Ha&s;lerig<HI>'s parts in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></NOTE> the wi&s;e&s;t Man, &s;ound he could never make that A&s;&s;embly &s;ettle &s;uch a Government as He affected, either in Church or State: and <HI>Ha&s;lerig,</HI> who was of a rude, and &s;tubborn Nature, and of a weak under&s;tanding, concurr'd only with him in all the fierce Coun&s;els, which might more irrecoverably di&s;inherit the King, and root out his Maje&s;ty's Party: in all other things relating to the Temporal, or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, they were not only of different judgements, but of extraordinary animo&s;ity <MILESTONE N="10"> again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>VANE was a Man not to be de&s;cribed by any Character of Religion; in which he had &s;wallow'd &s;ome of the fancies, and extravagancies of every Sect, or Faction; and was become (which cannot be expre&s;&s;ed by any other Language than was peculiar to that time) <HI>a Man above Or|dinances,</HI> unlimited, or unre&s;train'd by any rules, or bounds pre&s;cribed to other Men, by rea&s;on of his perfection. He was a perfect Enthu&s;ia&s;t; and, without doubt, did believe him&s;elf in&s;pired; which &s;o far corrupted his rea&s;on and under&s;tanding (which in all matters without the Verge of Religion was Superior to that of mo&s;t Men) that he did at &s;ome time <MILESTONE N="20"> believe, he was the Per&s;on deputed to Reign over the Saints upon Earth for a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>HASLERIG was, as to the State, perfectly Republican; and as to Religion, perfectly Presbyterian: and &s;o he might be &s;ure never to be troubled with a King or a Bi&s;hop, was indifferent to other things; only he believ'd the Parliament to be the only Government that would in|fallibly keep tho&s;e two out; and his credit in the Hou&s;e was greater than the other's; which made <HI>Vane</HI> le&s;s troubled at the Violence that was u&s;ed (though he would never advi&s;e it) and appear willing enough to confer, and joyn with tho&s;e who would find any other hinge to hang <MILESTONE N="30"> the Government upon: &s;o he pre&s;ently enter'd into conver&s;ation with tho&s;e of the Army, who were mo&s;t like to have Authority.</P>
<P>A MODEL of &s;uch a Government, as the People mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in, and &s;ubmit to, would require very much Agitation, and very long time; which the pre&s;ent conjuncture would not bear: nor were there enough of one mind, to give great Authority to their Coun&s;els. In This they <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee of Safety con|&s;tituted by the Army.</NOTE> could agree, which might be an expedient towards more ripe re&s;olutions, <Q>&startq;that a Number of Per&s;ons &s;hould be cho&s;en, who, under the &s;tyle of a <HI>Committee of Safety,</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the pre&s;ent entire Government, and have full power to revive all &s;uch Orders, or to make new, which <MILESTONE N="40"> might be nece&s;&s;ary for rai&s;ing of Money, or for doing any thing el&s;e which &s;hould be judged for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom; and to con&s;ider and determine, what form of Government was fit to be&endq; erected, to which the Nation was to &s;ubmit.</Q> <Q>They al&s;o declared &startq;all the Orders, Acts, or pretended Acts made in Parliament on the 10, 11, and 12 of <HI>October</HI> before their Interruption, to be void and null to all&endq; intents and purpo&s;es, as if they had never been.</Q></P>

<P>BEFORE the Parliament was routed, they di&s;cern'd what <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Intrigues would &s;hortly produce; <Q>and therefore had writ to <HI>Monk,</HI> &startq;that he would take care of his Army, le&s;t it &s;hould be corrupted again&s;t&endq; him, which they knew was endeavouring;</Q> <Q>and <HI>Ha&s;lerig,</HI> who had &s;ome friend&s;hip with him, writ particularly to him &startq;to continue firm to the&endq; Parliament;</Q> <Q>and to a&s;&s;ure him, &startq;that before <HI>Lambert</HI> &s;hould be able to be near him to give him any trouble, he would give him other di|verti&s;ement.&endq;</Q> And &s;ome time after <HI>Lambert</HI> had acted that violence <MILESTONE N="30"> upon the Speaker, &s;o that they could meet no more, <HI>Ha&s;lerig, Walton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ha&s;lerig, Walton, <HI>and</HI> Morley <HI>go to</HI> Port&s;mouth</NOTE> and <HI>Morley,</HI> three of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Government of the Ar|my, went to <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> where Colonel <HI>Whetham</HI> the Governour was their Friend, and devoted to the Presbyterian-Republican Party; for that di&s;tinction was now grown among&s;t them; Others, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of that Party, <Q>profe&s;&s;ing &startq;that they very much de&s;ired Mo|narchical Government, and the Per&s;on of the King, &s;o that they might&endq; have him without Epi&s;copacy,</Q> and enjoy the Lands of the Church; which they had divided among them. The&s;e three were well receiv'd at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> and that they might be without any di&s;turbance there, the <MILESTONE N="40"> Governour turn'd all &s;uch Officers and Soldiers out of the Town, who were &s;u&s;pected to be, or might be made of the Party of the Army; and Colonel <HI>Morley,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;t was in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> ea&s;ily drew in enough of his Friends, to make them very &s;ecure in their Garri&s;on; which the <HI>Committee of Safety</HI> thought would be quickly reduced, if all the re&s;t of the Kingdom were at their Devotion; nor did the matter it &s;elf much trouble them; for they knew that <HI>Ha&s;lerig</HI> would never be induced to &s;erve the King, who&s;e Intere&s;t only could break all their Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>BUT this open declaring of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> for the Parliament happen'd not till the following <HI>December.</HI> That which gave them real trouble <MILESTONE N="50"> was, that they receiv'd bold Letters from <HI>Monk,</HI> about the end of <HI>Octo|ber;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>to the Officers of the Army declaring for the Parlia+ment.</HI></NOTE> who pre&s;um'd to cen&s;ure, and find fault with what they had done, in u&s;ing &s;uch force and violence to the Parliament, from whom they had all their Power and Authority; and &s;hortly after they heard that

<PB N="547" REF="5570">
a younger Brother, he enter'd early into the life and condition of a Sol|dier, upon that Stage where &s;ome of all <HI>Europe</HI> then acted, between the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and had the reputation of a very good Foot-Officer in the Lord <HI>Vere</HI>'s Regiment in <HI>Holland,</HI> at the time when he a&s;&s;ign'd it to the Command of <HI>Colonel Goring.</HI> When the fir&s;t Troubles begun in <HI>Scotland, Monk,</HI> and many other Officers of the Nation, left the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service, and betook them&s;elves to the Service of the King. In the beginning of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebellion, he was &s;ent thither, with the Command of the Lord <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>'s own Regiment of Foot (who was <MILESTONE N="10"> then Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland)</HI> and continued in that &s;ervice with &s;ingular reputation of courage, and conduct. When the War broke out in <HI>England</HI> between the King and the Parliament, he fell under &s;ome di&s;countenance, upon a &s;u&s;picion of an inclination to the Parliament; which proceeded from his want of bitterne&s;s in his di&s;cour&s;es again&s;t them, rather than from any inclination towards them; as appear'd by his behaviour at <HI>Nant|wich,</HI> where he was taken Pri&s;oner, and remained in the Tower till the end of the War. For though his behaviour had been &s;uch in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when the tran&s;portation of the Regiment from thence, to &s;erve the King in <HI>England,</HI> was in debate, that it was evident enough he had no <MILESTONE N="20"> mind his Regiment &s;hould be &s;ent on that Expedition, and his An&s;wer to the Lord of <HI>Ormond</HI> was &s;o rough, and doubtful, that he thought not fit to tru&s;t him, but gave the Command of the Regiment to <HI>Harry Warren,</HI> the Lieutenant Colonel of it, an excellent Officer, generally known, and exceedingly beloved where he was known; yet when tho&s;e Regiments were &s;ent to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and there were others at the &s;ame time &s;ent to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and with them <HI>Monk</HI> went under &s;ome Cloud, and from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he was known to many Per&s;ons of Quality (and his elde&s;t Brother being at the &s;ame time mo&s;t zealous in the King's Service in the We&s;t, and mo&s;t u&s;eful) his profe&s;&s;ions were <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;o &s;incere (he being, throughout his whole life, never &s;u&s;pected of di&s;|&s;imulation) that all Men there thought him very worthy of all tru&s;t; and the King was willing to &s;end him into the We&s;t, where the Gentle|men had a great opinion of his ability to command. But he de&s;ired that he might &s;erve with his old Friends and Companions; and &s;o, with the King's leave, made all ha&s;t towards <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> where he arriv'd the very day before the Defeat at <HI>Nantwich;</HI> and though his Lieutenant Colo|nel was very de&s;irous to give up the Command again to him, and to receive his Orders, he would by no means at that time take it, but cho&s;e to &s;erve, as a Voluntier, in the fir&s;t Rank, with a Pike in his hand; and <MILESTONE N="40"> was the next day, as was &s;aid, taken Pri&s;oner with the re&s;t, and with mo&s;t of the other Officers &s;ent to <HI>Hull,</HI> and &s;hortly after from thence to the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>HE was no &s;ooner there, than the Lord <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> who had great kind|ne&s;s for him, and good Intere&s;t in the Parliament, with much impor|tunity endeavour'd to per&s;wade him to take a Commi&s;&s;ion in that Ser|vice, and offer'd him a Command &s;uperior to what he had ever had before; which he po&s;itively and di&s;dainfully refu&s;ed to accept, though the &s;treights he &s;uffer'd in Pri&s;on were very great, and he thought him&s;elf not kindly dealt with, that there was neither care for his Exchange, nor Money &s;ent <MILESTONE N="50"> for his &s;upport. But there was all po&s;&s;ible endeavour u&s;ed for the fir&s;t, by offering &s;everal Officers of the &s;ame Quality for his Exchange; which was allways refu&s;ed; <Q>there having been an Ordinance made, &startq;that no Officer who had been tran&s;ported out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;hould ever be ex|changed;&endq;</Q>
<PB N="548" REF="5580">
&s;o that mo&s;t of them remained &s;till in Pri&s;on with him in the Tower, and the re&s;t in other Pri&s;ons; who all underwent the &s;ame hard|&s;hips by the extreme nece&s;&s;ity of the King's condition, which could not provide Money enough for their &s;upply; yet all was done towards it that was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>WHEN the War was at an end, and the King a Pri&s;oner, <HI>Cromwell</HI> prevailed with <HI>Monk</HI> for his liberty and preferment, to engage him&s;elf again in the War of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And, from that time, <HI>Monk</HI> continued very firm to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who was liberal, and bountiful to him, and took him into his entire confidence; and after he had put the Com|mand <MILESTONE N="10"> of <HI>Scotland</HI> into his hands, he feared nothing from tho&s;e Quar|ters; nor was there any Man in either of the Armies, upon who&s;e fi|delity to him&s;elf <HI>Cromwell</HI> more depended. And tho&s;e of his We&s;tern friends, who thought be&s;t of him, thought it to no purpo&s;e to make any Attempt upon him, whil&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI> lived. But a&s;&s;oon as He was dead, <HI>Monk</HI> was generally looked upon as a Man more inclined to the King, than any other in great Authority, if he might di&s;cover it with|out too much lo&s;s or hazard. His Elder Brother had been entirely de|voted to the King's Service, and all his Relations were of the &s;ame faith. He him&s;elf had no fumes of Fanatici&s;m to turn his head, nor any cre|dit <MILESTONE N="20"> with, or dependence upon any who were &s;way'd by tho&s;e trances.</P>
<P>HE had a younger Brother, a Divine, who had a Par&s;onage in <HI>De|von&s;hire,</HI> and had, through all the ill times, carried him&s;elf with &s;ingu|lar Integrity; and, being a Gentleman of a good Family, was in great reputation with all tho&s;e who con&s;tantly adhered to the King. S^r <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> and S^r <HI>John Greenvil,</HI> who had both friend&s;hip for the Gene|ral, and old acquaintance, and all confidence in his Brother, advi&s;ed with him, <Q>&startq;whether, &s;ince <HI>Cromwell</HI> was now gone, and in all rea&s;on it might be expected that his death would be attended with a general Revolution, by which the King's Intere&s;t would be again di&s;puted, he <MILESTONE N="30"> did not believe, that the General might be wrought upon, in a fit conjuncture, to &s;erve the King, in which, they thought, he would be &s;ure to meet with a univer&s;al concurrence from the whole <HI>Scoti&s;h&endq;</HI> Nation.</Q> The hone&s;t Clergy-man thought the Overture &s;o rea&s;onable, and wi&s;hed &s;o heartily it might be embraced, that he offer'd him&s;elf to make a journey to his Brother into <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon pretence of a vi&s;it (there having been allways a brotherly Affection perform'd between them) and directly to propo&s;e it to him. <HI>Pollard</HI> and <HI>Greenvil</HI> inform'd the King of this de&s;ign; and believ'd well them&s;elves of what they wi&s;h'd &s;o much, and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty's approbation, and In&s;truction. The <MILESTONE N="40"> King had rea&s;on to approve it; and &s;ent &s;uch directions as he thought mo&s;t proper for &s;uch a Negotiation. Whereupon his Brother begun his journey towards <HI>Edenborough,</HI> where the General receiv'd him well. But after he had &s;taid &s;ome time there, and found an opportunity to tell him on what Errand he came, He &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, without di&s;|covering to him any inclination to the bu&s;ine&s;s he came about, <Q>advi&s;ing him &startq;&endq;to return no more to him with &s;uch Propo&s;itions.</Q></P>
<P>IN truth, at that time, the General had not given the lea&s;t publick proof that he had any thought, or purpo&s;e of contributing to the King's Re&s;toration, which he might po&s;&s;ibly think to be de&s;perate. Some ra|ther <MILESTONE N="50"> believed, that the di&s;po&s;ition, which afterwards grew in him, to|wards it, did ari&s;e from divers Accidents, which fell out in the cour&s;e of Affairs, and &s;eem'd even to oblige him to undertake that which in
<PB N="549" REF="5590">
the end conduced &s;o much to his greatne&s;s and glory: yet from that very time, his Brother's Inclinations to the King being known, and his journey taken notice of, it was generally believed in <HI>Scotland</HI> that he had a purpo&s;e to &s;erve the King; which his Maje&s;ty took no pains to di&s;claim either there, or in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>NOW upon the &s;everal &s;uddain Changes in <HI>England,</HI> and the Army's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it &s;elf of the entire Government, <HI>Monk</HI> &s;aw he &s;hould be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk<HI>'s jea|lou&s;y of</HI> Lam|bert <HI>before this time.</HI></NOTE> quickly overrun and de&s;troyed by <HI>Lambert</HI>'s greatne&s;s, of which he had allways great emulation, if he did not provide for his own &s;ecurity. And <MILESTONE N="10"> therefore when he heard of his march towards the North, he u&s;ed all in|ventions to get time, by entring into Treaties, and in hope that there would appear &s;ome other Party that would own and avow the Parlia|ment's Intere&s;t, as He had done: nor did he then manife&s;t to have more in his purpo&s;e, than his own profit and honour, under the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that Government.</P>
<P>WHEN he heard of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s being pa&s;&s;ed <HI>York,</HI> and his making ha&s;t to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and had purged out of his Army all tho&s;e who&s;e affections and fidelity were &s;u&s;pected by him, he called together an A&s;|&s;embly, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a Convention of the States of <HI>Scotland;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He calls toge|ther an A&s;|&s;embly of the</HI> Scoti&s;h <HI>Na|tion.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> which he had &s;ubdued to all imaginable tamene&s;s, though he had exer|ci&s;ed no other power over them than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reduce that People to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that Tyrannical Yoke. In all his other carriage towards them, but what was in order to that end, he was friendly and companiable enough; and as he was fear'd by the Nobility, and hated by the Clergy, &s;o he was not unlov'd by the Common People, who receiv'd more Ju&s;tice, and le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ion from him, than they had been accu&s;tom'd to under their own Lords. When this Convention ap|pear'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">His di&s;cour&s;e to them</NOTE> before him, he told them, <Q>&startq;that he had receiv'd a Call from Hea|ven, and Earth, to march with his Army into <HI>England,</HI> for the better <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ettlement of the Government there; and though he did not intend his ab&s;ence &s;hould be long, yet he fore&s;aw that there might be &s;ome di&s;turbance of the Peace which they enjoyed; and therefore he ex|pected, and de&s;ired, that, in any &s;uch occa&s;ion, they would be ready&endq; to joyn with the Forces he left behind in their own defence.</Q> In the &s;econd place, which was indeed all he cared for from them, he very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed them, <Q>&startq;that they would pay in a pre&s;ent Sum of Mo|ney out of the Arrears of their Taxes, for &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities of&endq; the Army, without which it could not well march into <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM the time that he had &s;ettled his Government in that King|dom, <MILESTONE N="40"> he had &s;hew'd more kindne&s;s to, and u&s;ed more familiarity with &s;uch Per&s;ons as were mo&s;t notorious for Affection to the King, as find|ing them a more direct and punctual People than the re&s;t: and when the&s;e Men re&s;orted to him upon this Convention, though they could draw nothing from him of promi&s;e, or intimation to any &s;uch purpo&s;e, yet he was very well content they &s;hould believe that he carried with him very good Inclinations to the King; by which imagination of theirs, he receiv'd great Advantage: for they payed him the Arrears of a twelve Months Tax over the Kingdom; which complied with his wi&s;h, and partly enabled him to draw his Army together. And after he had a&s;|&s;ign'd <MILESTONE N="50"> tho&s;e whom he thought fit to leave behind him, and afterwards $ut them under the Command of Major General <HI>Morgan,</HI> he march'd with the re&s;t to <HI>Berwick;</HI> where a good part of his Hor&s;e and Foot ex|pected him; having refu&s;ed to ratify the Treaty &s;ign'd by his Commi&s;|&s;ioners

at <HI>London,</HI> and committed Colonel <HI>Wilks,</HI> one of them, upon his return to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for having con&s;ented to &s;omething prejudicial to him, and expre&s;ly contrary to his In&s;tructions. However he de&s;ired to gain farther time, and agreed to another Treaty to be held at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> which, though he knew it would be govern'd by <HI>Lambert,</HI> was like not to be without &s;ome benefit to him&s;elf, becau&s;e it would keep up the opinion in <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> that he was inclined to an accommodation of Peace.</P>
<P>IT was towards the end of <HI>November,</HI> that <HI>Lambert</HI> with his Ar|my <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>comes with his Army to</HI> New-Ca&s;tle <HI>towards the end of</HI> No|vember.</NOTE> my arriv'd at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> where he found the Officers and Soldiers <MILESTONE N="10"> whom <HI>Monk</HI> had ca&s;hier'd; and who, he per&s;waded the People, had de|&s;erted <HI>Monk,</HI> for his infidelity to the Common-wealth, and that mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who yet &s;tayed with him, would do &s;o too, a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hould be within di&s;tance to receive them. But he now found his confidence had carried him too far, and that he was at too great a di&s;tance to give that relief to his <HI>Committee of Safety,</HI> which it was like to &s;tand in need of. <HI>Ha&s;lerig</HI> and <HI>Morley</HI> were now looked upon, as the Per&s;ons inve&s;ted with the Authority of Parliament, who&s;e Intere&s;t was &s;upported by them; and the Officer, who was &s;ent by <HI>the Committee of Safety</HI> to re|&s;train them in <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> or rather to re&s;train Per&s;ons from re&s;orting <MILESTONE N="20"> to them, found him&s;elf de&s;erted by more than half his Soldiers; <Q>who declared &startq;&endq;that they would &s;erve the Parliament,</Q> and &s;o went into <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> and another Officer, who was &s;ent with a &s;tronger Party <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Soldiers before</HI> Port&s;|mouth <HI>re|volted to it.</HI></NOTE> to &s;econd them, di&s;covering, or fomenting the &s;ame Affections in his Soldiers, very frankly carried them to the &s;ame place: &s;o that they were now grown too Numerous to be contain'd within that Garri&s;on, but were quarter'd to be in readine&s;s to march whither their Generals, <HI>Ha&s;lerig</HI> and <HI>Morley,</HI> would conduct them.</P>
<P>THE City took new courage from hence; and what the Ma&s;ters dur&s;t not publickly own, the Apprentices did, their di&s;like of the pre&s;ent Go|vernment; <MILESTONE N="30"> and flocking together in great Multitudes, <Q>declared &startq;that&endq; they would have a free Parliament.</Q> And though Colonel <HI>Hew&s;on</HI> (a bold fellow, who had been an ill Shoemaker, and afterwards Clerk to a Brewer of &s;mall Beer) who was left to guard <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed that Commotion by marching into the City, and killing &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City Ap|prentices ri&s;e, but are &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by</HI> Hew&s;on</NOTE> of the Apprentices, yet the lo&s;s of that blood inflamed the City the more again&s;t the Army; <Q>which, they &s;aid, &startq;was only kept on foot to&endq; murther the Citizens.</Q> And it was &s;aid, they cau&s;ed a Bill of Indictment to be prepared again&s;t <HI>Hew&s;on</HI> for tho&s;e Murthers. The Common Coun|cil appear'd every day more refractory, and refu&s;ed to concur in any <MILESTONE N="40"> thing that was propo&s;ed to them by <HI>the Committee of Safety;</HI> which begun to be univer&s;ally abhorr'd, as like to be the Original of &s;uch an|other Tyranny as <HI>Cromwell</HI> had erected, &s;ince it wholely depended upon the power and &s;pirit of the Army: though, on the other hand, the Committee prote&s;ted and declared to them, <Q>&startq;that there &s;hould be a Parliament called to meet together in <HI>February</HI> next, under &s;uch qua|lifications and re&s;trictions, as might be &s;ure to exclude &s;uch Per&s;ons&endq; who would de&s;troy them.</Q> But this gave no &s;atisfaction, every Man remembring the Parliament that had been packed by <HI>Cromwell.</HI></P>

But the&s;e ca&s;hier'd Officers, upon &s;o great revolutions in the City and the Navy, and the News of the Advance of <HI>Ha&s;lerig</HI> and <HI>Morley,</HI> re&s;olved to con&s;er with their old Soldiers, and try whether they had as much credit with them as their new Officers; and found &s;o much encouragement, that, at a time appointed, they put them|&s;elves into the heads of their Regiments, and marched with them into the field; whence, after a &s;hort conference together, and renewing vows to each other never more to de&s;ert the Parliament, they all marched <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Soldiers in</HI> London <HI>re&s;olve to re|&s;tore the Par|liament; and wait on the Speaker.</HI></NOTE> into <HI>Chancery-</HI>Lane to the Hou&s;e of the Speaker; and profe&s;&s;ed their <MILESTONE N="30"> re&s;olution to live and die with the Parliament, and never more to &s;werve from their fidelity to it.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, upon the fir&s;t News of the froward Spirit in the City, had &s;ent back <HI>Desborough</HI>'s Regiment; which was now marched as near <HI>London</HI> as S^t <HI>Albans;</HI> where, hearing what their fellows at <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI> with whom they were to joyn, had done, they re&s;olved not to be the la&s;t in their Submi&s;&s;ion; but declared that they likewi&s;e were for the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Desborough<HI>'s Regiment re|volt to the Parliament.

In all the&s;e &s;everal tergiver&s;ations of the Soldiers, General <HI>Fleetwood</HI> remain'd &s;till in con&s;ultations with <HI>the Committee of Safety;</HI> and when any In|telligence <MILESTONE N="40"> was brought of any murmur among&s;t the Soldiers, by which a revolt might en&s;ue, and he was de&s;ired to go among&s;t them to con|firm them, he would fall upon his Knees to his prayers, and could hardly be prevaild with to go to them. And when he was among&s;t them, and in the middle of any di&s;cour&s;e, he would invite them all to prayers, and put him&s;elf upon his Knees before them: and when &s;ome of his friends importuned him to appear more vigorous in the Charge he had, without which they mu&s;t be all de&s;troy'd, they could get no other an|&s;wer from him, than <Q>&startq;that God had &s;pit in his face, and would not&endq; hear him:</Q> &s;o that Men cea&s;ed to wonder why <HI>Lambert</HI> had preferr'd <MILESTONE N="50"> him to the Office of General, and been content with the &s;econd Com|mand for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>LENTHAL the Speaker, upon this new Declaration of the Soldiers,
<PB N="552" REF="5620">
recover'd his Spirit, and went into the City, conferr'd with the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lenthal <HI>goes into the City;</HI></NOTE> Mayor and Aldermen, and declared to them, <Q>&startq;that the Parliament&endq; would meet (though not immediately) within very few days.</Q> For, as the Members were not many, who were alive, and &s;uffer'd to meet as the Parliament, &s;o they were now di&s;per&s;ed into &s;everal places. Then he went to the Tower, and, by his own Authority, remov'd the Lieu|tenant, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Changes the Command of the Tower.</NOTE> who had been confirm'd there by the <HI>Committee of Safety;</HI> and put S^r <HI>Anthony A&s;hley Cooper,</HI> and other Members of the Parlia|ment, into the Government and Command of the Tower.</P>
<P>ALL things being in this good Order, He and the Members met again <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment meets again at</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter.</NOTE> together at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> on <HI>December</HI> the 26^t^h, and a&s;&s;umed the Govern|ment of the three Kingdoms, out of which they had been twice before ca&s;t, with &s;o much reproach and infamy. A&s;&s;oon as they came together, they repealed their Act again&s;t the payment of Exci&s;e and Cu&s;toms; and put tho&s;e Collections into the &s;tate they had been formerly in, that they might be &s;ure not to be without Money to pay their Pro&s;elyte Forces, and to carry on their other expences. Then they appointed Commi&s;&s;ioners to direct the Quarters into which the Army &s;hould be put; and made an Order, that all the Troops under the Command of <NOTE PLACE="marg">They order Lambert's Troops to their &s;everal Quar|ters</NOTE> <HI>Lambert,</HI> without &s;ending any direction to him, &s;hould repair to tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="20"> Quarters to which they were a&s;&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>THIS Man was now in a di&s;con&s;olate condition: as <HI>Monk</HI> approach'd nearer to him, very many of his Soldiers de&s;erted him, and went to the other. The Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> had rai&s;ed Forces, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>York,</HI> without declaring any thing of his purpo&s;e. And this la&s;t Order of the Parliament &s;o entirely &s;tripp'd <HI>Lambert</HI> of his Army, that there remain'd not with him above one hundred Hor&s;e; all the re&s;t return'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert<HI>'s Army &s;epa|rates; and He is committed to the Tower.</HI></NOTE> to their Quarters with all quietne&s;s and re&s;ignation; and him&s;elf was &s;ome time after committed to the Tower. The re&s;t of the Officers of the Army, who had been formerly ca&s;hier'd by the Parliament, and <MILESTONE N="30"> had re&s;um'd their Commands that they might break it, were again di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from their Charges, and committed Pri&s;oners to their own Hou&s;es. S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and divers other Members of the Hou&s;e who <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vane, and Others who had concurr'd with</HI> the Committee of Safety, <HI>con|fined to their own Hou&s;es.</HI></NOTE> had concurr'd with <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> were likewi&s;e confined to their own Hou&s;es: &s;o that the Parliament &s;eem'd now again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a more ab&s;olute Authority than ever it had been, and to be without any danger of oppo&s;ition, or contradiction.</P>
<P>THE other changes and fluctuations had &s;till admini&s;ter'd &s;ome hopes to the King; and the daily breaking out of new Animo&s;ities among&s;t the Chief Mini&s;ters of the former mi&s;chiefs, di&s;po&s;ed Men to believe that the Government might at la&s;t re&s;t upon the old foundation. Men ex|pected, <MILESTONE N="40"> that a very &s;harp Engagement between <HI>Lambert</HI> and <HI>Monk</HI> might make their parts of the Army for ever after irreconcilable, and that all Parties would be at la&s;t obliged to con&s;ent to a new Parliament; in the election whereof there was a rea&s;onable belief, that the general temper of the People would choo&s;e &s;ober and wi&s;e Men, who would ra|ther bind up the wounds which had been already made, than endeavour to widen them. <HI>The Committee of Safety</HI> had neither receiv'd the re|verence, nor inculcated the fear, which any Government mu&s;t do, that was to la&s;t any time. But this &s;urpri&s;ing Re&s;urrection of the Parliament, that had been &s;o often exploded, &s;o often dead and buried, and was the <MILESTONE N="50"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon this $Word$ of the Parliament the King's $Word$ &s;eem'd $Span$</NOTE> only Image of power that was mo&s;t formidable to the King and his Party, &s;eem'd to pull up all their hopes by the Roots, and was interpreted
<PB N="553" REF="5630">
by that Party, as an Act of Providence to e&s;tabli&s;h their Mon&s;trous Murthers and U&s;urpation. And it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, and tran&s;mitted as a truth to Po&s;terity, that there were very few Men, who bore a part in the&s;e changes and giddy revolutions, who had the lea&s;t purpo&s;e or thought to contribute towards the King's Re&s;toration, or who wi&s;h'd well to his Intere&s;t; they who did &s;o, being &s;o totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and di&s;pirited, that they were only at gaze, what light might break out of this darkne&s;s, and what order Providence might produce out of this confu&s;ion. This was the true State of affairs when the King return'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condition of the King at</HI> Bru&s;&s;els.</NOTE> from <HI>Fuentarabia</HI> to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> or within few days after; and therefore <MILESTONE N="10"> 'tis no wonder, that there was that dejection of Spirit upon tho&s;e about his Maje&s;ty; and that the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who &s;aw &s;o little hope of re|turning into <HI>England,</HI> was well plea&s;ed with the condition that was of|fer'd him in <HI>Spain,</HI> and that his Servants were impatient to find him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>WHILST the divi&s;ions had continued in the Army, and the Parlia|ment &s;eem'd entirely depo&s;ed and laid a&s;ide, and no body imagin'd a po&s;&s;ibility of any compo&s;ition without blood, the Cardinal him&s;elf, as is &s;aid before, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters, &s;eem'd ready and prepared to advance any de&s;ign of the King's. But when they &s;aw all tho&s;e conten|tions <MILESTONE N="20"> and raging Animo&s;ities compo&s;ed, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, without one broken head, and tho&s;e very Men again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Government and the Army, who had been &s;o &s;cornfully rejected and trampled upon, and who had it now in their power, as well as their purpo&s;e, to level all tho&s;e preheminences which had overlook'd them, they look'd upon the Parliament as more &s;ecurely &s;ettled again&s;t dome&s;tic di&s;turbances, and much more formidably, with reference to their Neighbours, than it had been under <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf; and thought of nothing more, than how to make advantageous and firm Alliances with it.</P>
<P>THERE remain'd only within the King's own brea&s;t &s;ome faint hope <MILESTONE N="30"> (and God knows it was very faint) that <HI>Monk</HI>'s march into <HI>England</HI> might yet produce &s;ome alteration. His Maje&s;ty had a &s;ecret corre&s;pon|dence with &s;ome principal Officers in his Army, who were much tru&s;ted by him, and had promi&s;ed great Services; and it was pre&s;um'd that they would undertake no &s;uch perilous Engagement without His privity and connivance. Be&s;ides, it might be expected from his judgement, that whatever pre&s;ent conditions the governing Party might give him, for the Service he had done, he could not but conclude, that they would be allways jealous of the Power they &s;aw he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and that an Army that had marched &s;o far barely upon his word, would be as <MILESTONE N="40"> ready to march to any place, or for any purpo&s;e, he would conduct them. And it was evident enough that the Parliament re&s;olv'd to new model their Army, and to have no Man in any &s;uch extent of Command, as to be able to controle Their Coun&s;els. Then his Maje&s;ty knew they were jealous of his fidelity, how much &s;oever they courted him at that time; and therefore <HI>Monk</HI> would think him&s;elf obliged to provide for his own &s;afety and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>BUT, I &s;ay, the&s;e were but faint hopes, grounded upon &s;uch proba|bilities as de&s;pairing Men are willing to entertain. The truth is, tho&s;e Officers had hone&s;t Inclinations; and, as wi&s;e Men, had concluded, <MILESTONE N="50"> that, from tho&s;e frequent Shuffles, &s;ome Game at la&s;t might fall out that might prove to the King's Advantage, and &s;o were willing to be|&s;peak their own welcome by an early application; which, in regard of
<PB N="554" REF="5640">
the Per&s;ons tru&s;ted by them, they concluded would be attended with no danger. But it never appear'd they ever gave the General the lea&s;t cau&s;e to imagine they had any &s;uch Affection; and if they had, 'tis like|ly they had paid dearly for it. And it was the King's great happine&s;s, that the General never own'd his purpo&s;e to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty, till it fell to be in his power, and indeed was the be&s;t thing in his power to do. If he had declared his re&s;olution &s;ooner, he had been de&s;troyed him&s;elf; the whole Machine being &s;o infinitely above his &s;trength, that it could be only moved by a Divine hand; and it is Glory enough to his Me|mory, that he was God's In&s;trument in bringing tho&s;e mighty things to pa&s;s, which, undoubtedly, no one Man living had, of him&s;elf, either Wi&s;dom enough to fore&s;ee, or Under&s;tanding to contrive, or Courage to attempt, and execute.</P>
<P>WHEN the Parliament found them&s;elves at &s;o much ea&s;e, and &s;o much without apprehen&s;ion of farther in&s;ecurity, they heartily wi&s;h'd that General <HI>Monk</HI> was again in his old Quarters in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>marches to|wards</HI> Lon|don.</NOTE> he continued his march towards <HI>London,</HI> without expecting their Or|ders, &s;o they knew not how to command him to return, whom they had &s;ent for to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, without &s;eeing him, and giving him thanks and reward for his great Service: <Q>yet they &s;ent to him their de&s;ire, &startq;that&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment de&s;ire, that part of his Forces may be &s;ent back to</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> a good part of his Forces might be &s;ent back to <HI>Scotland;</HI></Q> and He, <MILESTONE N="20"> having &s;ent back as many as he knew would be &s;ufficient for any Work they could have to do in tho&s;e Northern parts, continued his march with an Army of about five thou&s;and Foot and Hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch Per&s;ons in who&s;e affections to him he had full confidence. When he came to <HI>York,</HI> he found that City in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lord <HI>Fair|fax;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>comes to</HI> York</NOTE> who receiv'd him with open Armes, as if he had drawn tho&s;e Forces together, and &s;ci&s;ed upon that place, to prevent the Army's po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing it, and to make <HI>Monk</HI>'s Advance into <HI>England</HI> the le&s;s inter|rupted.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that, upon a Letter from the King, deliver'd to <HI>Fair|fax</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Fairfax<HI>'s part in this whole bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"> by S^r <HI>Horatio Town&s;end,</HI> and with his &s;ole privity, and upon a pre|&s;umption that General <HI>Monk</HI> brought good Affections with him for his Maje&s;ty's Service, that Lord had call'd together &s;ome of his old di&s;|banded Officers and Soldiers, and many principal Gentlemen of the Country, and marched in the head of them into <HI>York,</HI> &s;ome time after that <HI>Lambert</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed towards <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> with a full re&s;olution to declare for the King; but when he could not afterwards di&s;cover, upon conference with <HI>Monk,</HI> that he had any &s;uch thought, he &s;atisfied him|&s;elf with the Te&s;timony of his own Con&s;cience, and pre&s;ently di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <MILESTONE N="40"> his Troops, being well contented with having, in the head of the prin|cipal Gentlemen of that large County, pre&s;ented their de&s;ires to the Ge|neral, fir&s;t in Per&s;on, and afterwards in Writing, <Q>&startq;that he would be in&s;trumental to re&s;tore the Nation to Peace and Security, and to the enjoying tho&s;e Rights and Liberties, which by the Law were due to them, and of which they had been robb'd and depriv'd by &s;o many years di&s;tractions; and that, in order thereunto, he would prevail, either for the re&s;toring tho&s;e Members which had been excluded in the year 1648 by force and violence, that they might exerci&s;e that Tru&s;t the Kingdom had repo&s;ed in them; or that a free and full Par|liament <MILESTONE N="50"> might be called by the Votes of the People; to which all Sub|jects&endq; had a Right by their birth.</Q></P>

<P>THE Parliament was far from being confident that <HI>Monk</HI> was above temptation: the manner of his march with &s;uc a Body, his receiving &s;o many Addre&s;&s;es from the People, and his treating Malignants &s;o civilly, &s;tartled them much; and though his Profe&s;&s;ions of fidelity to the Par|liament, and referring all determinations to Their Wi&s;dom, had a good A&s;pect towards them, yet they feared that he might ob&s;erve too much how generally odious they were grown to the People, which might le&s;&s;en his reverence towards them.

<P>HE continued his march with very few halts, till he came to S^t <HI>Al|bans.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At S^t</HI> Albans <HI>he &s;ent to the Parliament to have the other Regiments re|mov'd out of Town.</HI></NOTE> <Q>There he &s;topped for &s;ome days; and &s;ent to the Parliament, &startq;that he had &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that tho&s;e Regiments and Troops of the Army who had formerly de&s;erted them, though for the pre&s;ent they were returned to their obedience, would not live peaceably with his&endq; Men;</Q> <Q>and therefore de&s;ired that all the Soldiers (except one or two Regiments, which he named) &startq;who were then quarter'd in the <HI>Strand, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> or other Suburbs of the City, might be pre&s;ently re|moved, and &s;ent to more di&s;tant Quarters, that there might be room&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> for his Army.</Q> This Me&s;&s;age was unexpected, and exceedingly per|plexed them; and made them &s;ee their Fate would &s;till be under the force and awe of an Army. However they found it nece&s;&s;ary to com|ply; and &s;ent their Orders to all Soldiers to depart; which, with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment gives Or|ders accord|ingly.</NOTE> rea&s;on and ground of their re&s;olution, was &s;o di&s;dainfully receiv'd, that a Mutiny did ari&s;e among&s;t the Soldiers; and the Regiment that was quarter'd in <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> Hou&s;e, expre&s;ly refu&s;ed to obey tho&s;e Orders; &s;o that there were like to be new Uproars. But their Officers, who would have been glad to inflame them upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, were under re|&s;traint, or ab&s;ent: and &s;o at la&s;t all was well compo&s;ed, and Officers <MILESTONE N="50"> and Soldiers removed to the Quarters a&s;&s;ign'd them, with animo&s;ity enough again&s;t tho&s;e who were to &s;ucceed them in their old ones. And <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>marches in a|bout the be|ginning of</HI> Fe|bruary.</NOTE> in the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> General <HI>Monk</HI> with his Army marched
<PB N="556" REF="5660">
through the City into the <HI>Strand,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> where it was quar|ter'd; his own Lodgings being provided for him in <HI>White-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>HE was &s;hortly after conducted to the Parliament. There he had a <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is con|ducted to the Parliament, and compli|mented by the Speaker.</NOTE> Chair appointed for him to fit in; <Q>and the Speaker made him a Speech to this effect, &startq;that though it was God, and not Man, who had done this great work, and ought to have the Glory of it; yet the Influence of that Glory extended to Him the In&s;trument, as a reward of his pru|dent and wi&s;e Conduct: that when their Friends had left them, and there was a great defection in duty and tru&s;t, &s;o that the whole Na|tion &s;eem'd to be expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t ruin; they di&s;cern'd, as the Prophet did, a little Cloud afar off, and in His hand which had <MILESTONE N="10"> di&s;per&s;ed the Mi&s;eries of the&s;e Nations, and was become a glorious Mercy to them all: that the Hou&s;e had a true re&s;entment of his Ser|vice, and return'd their hearty thanks to Him, and all his Officers and&endq; Soldiers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE General was not a Man of Eloquence or Volubility of Speech; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk<HI>'s Re|ply.</HI></NOTE> but after having thanked them, &startq;for the honour they had done him for&endq; but doing his duty;</Q> <Q>he told them, &startq;that, in his march from <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;everal Applications, with numerous Sub&s;criptions, had been made to him, for a full and free Parliament, for admittance of the &s;ecluded <MILESTONE N="20"> Members without any previous Oath or Engagement; and that this Parliament would determine their Sitting: to all which he had an|&s;wer'd, that they were now a free Parliament; and that they had voted to fill up their Hou&s;e, and then they would be a full Parliament; and that they had already determin'd their Sitting. But as for the &s;e|cluded Members, this Parliament had already given judgement in it, in which all People ought to acquie&s;ce; and that to admit any Mem|bers to &s;it in Parliament, without a previous Oath to pre&s;erve the Go|vernment in being, was never done in <HI>England.</HI> But now he craved pardon to &s;ay to them&s;elves, that the le&s;s Oaths or Engagements were <MILESTONE N="30"> impo&s;ed, their Settlement would be the &s;ooner attain'd to: that He knew, all the &s;ober Gentry would clo&s;e with them, if they might be tenderly and gently u&s;ed: that it was their common Concernment to amplify, not to le&s;&s;en, their Intere&s;t, and to be careful that neither the Cavalier nor the Fanatick Party &s;hould have yet a &s;hare in the Ci|vil,&endq; or Military Power.</Q></P>
<P>THE re&s;t of his Speech concern'd <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> And all being &s;poken with more than his natural warmth, there were &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in it which they di&s;liked. But others gave them &s;ome ea&s;e, and hope that he would be faithful, though inwardly they heartily <MILESTONE N="40"> wi&s;h'd that he was again in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that they had been left to contend with the Malignity of their old Army; and they watched for &s;ome occa&s;ion that he might manife&s;t his fidelity and re&s;ignation to them, or give them ju&s;t occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect and que&s;tion it.</P>
<P>THE late confu&s;ions and interruptions of all publick receipts had wholely emptied their Coffers, out of which the Army, and all other expences, were to be &s;upplied. And though the Parliament had, upon their coming together again, renewed their Ordinances for all Collections and Payments, yet Money came in very &s;lowly; and the People gene|rally had &s;o little reverence for their Legi&s;lators, that they gave very <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;low obedience to their directions: &s;o that they found it nece&s;&s;ary, for their pre&s;ent &s;upply, till they might by degrees make them&s;elves more univer&s;ally obey'd, to require the City pre&s;ently to collect and bring in
<PB N="557" REF="5670">
the Arrears of their Taxes, and in the mean time to borrow a con&s;idera|ble Sum of Money of them; which could not be ea&s;ily done but by the advice, and with the con&s;ent of the Common-Council; that is, it could not be levied and collected orderly, and peaceably, without their di&s;tri|bution.</P>
<P>THE Common-Council was con&s;tituted of &s;uch Per&s;ons as were weary <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Common-Council of the City are re|fractory to the Parliament</NOTE> of the Parliament, and would in no degree &s;ubmit to, or comply with any of their Commands. They did not only utterly refu&s;e to con&s;ent to what was demanded, but, in the debate of it, excepted again&s;t the Authority, and, upon the matter, declared, <Q>&startq;that they would never <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ubmit to any Impo&s;ition that was not granted by a free and lawful&endq; Parliament.</Q> And it was generally believ'd, that they had a&s;&s;umed this courage upon &s;ome confidence they had in the General; and the Apprehen&s;ion of this, made the Parliament to be in the greater per|plexity and di&s;traction. This refu&s;al would immediately have put an end to their Empire; they therefore re&s;olved upon this occa&s;ion to make a full Experiment of their own power, and of their General's obedience.</P>
<P>THE Parliament having received a full information from tho&s;e Al|dermen, and others, who&s;e Intere&s;t was bound up with their's, of all <MILESTONE N="20"> that had pa&s;&s;ed at the Common-Council, and of the &s;editious di&s;cour&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions made by &s;everal of the Citizens, referr'd it to the con&s;i|deration of the Council of State, what was fit to be done towards the Rebellious City, to reduce them to that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which they ought to pay to the Parliament. <Q>The Council of State deliberated upon the mat|ter, and return'd their Advice to the Parliament, &startq;that &s;ome part of the Army might be &s;ent into the City, and remain there, to pre&s;erve the peace thereof, and of the Common-wealth, and to reduce it to the obedience of the Parliament. In order thereunto, and for their better humiliation, they thought it convenient that the Po&s;ts and Chains &s;hould be removed from, and out of the &s;everal Streets of the <MILESTONE N="30"> City; and that the Portculli&s;es, and Gates of the City, &s;hould be taken&endq; down and broken.</Q> <Q>Over and above this, they named ten or eleven Per&s;ons, who had been the principal Conductors in the Common-Council, all Citizens of great reputation; and advi&s;ed &startq;that they &s;hould be ap|prehended and committed to Pri&s;on, and that thereupon a new Com|mon-Council&endq; might be elected, that would be more at their Devotion.</Q></P>
<P>THIS round advice was embraced by the Parliament; and they had now a fit occa&s;ion to make experiment of the courage and fidelity of their General, and commanded him to march into the City with his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>&s;ent in|to the City to reduce it to obedience:</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> Army, and to execute all tho&s;e particulars which they thought &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their Service and He as readily executed their Commands; led his Army into the Town on <HI>Feb.</HI> the 9^t^h, neglected the entreaties and prayers of all who applied to him (whereof there were many who be|lieved he meant better towards them) cau&s;ed as many, as he could, of tho&s;e who were &s;o pro&s;cribed to be apprehended, and &s;ent them to the Tower; and, with all the circum&s;tances of contempt, pull'd down and broke the Gates and Portculli&s;es, to the confu&s;ion and con&s;ternation of the whole City; and having thus expo&s;ed it to the &s;corn and laughter of all who hated it, he return'd Him&s;elf to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and his Army <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Returns $$</HI> White-Hall</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> to their former Quarters. And by this la&s;t Act of compliance he fru|&s;trated the pre&s;ent hopes of tho&s;e who had expected better from him, and confirm'd his Ma&s;ters, that they could not be too confident of his
<PB N="558" REF="5680">
obedience to their mo&s;t extravagant Injunctions. And many at that time feared, that if the Parliament had cultivated this tame re&s;ignation of his, with any temper and di&s;cretion, by preparing his con&s;ent and ap|probation to their proceedings, they might have found a full conde&s;cen|&s;ion from him, at lea&s;t no oppo&s;ition to all their other Coun&s;els. But they were &s;o infatuated with pride and in&s;olence, that they could not di&s;cern the ways to their own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>WHILST He was executing this their Tyranny upon the City, They were contriving how to le&s;&s;en his power and Authority, and re&s;olv'd to joyn others with him in the Command of the Army; and, upon that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment re&s;olve to joyn others in Commi&s;&s;ion with him, and receive a Peti|tion by</HI> Bare|bone <HI>from the Fanaticks.</HI></NOTE> very day, they received a Petition, which they had fomented, pre|&s;ented <MILESTONE N="10"> to the Parliament by a Man notorious in tho&s;e times, and who hath been formerly mention'd, <HI>Prai&s;e-God Barebone,</HI> in the head of a crowd of Sectaries. The Petition begun with all the imaginable bitter|ne&s;s and reproaches upon the Memory of the late King, and again&s;t the Per&s;on of the pre&s;ent King, and all the Nobility, Clergy, and Gen|try of the Kingdom, which adhered to him; the utter Extirpation of all which it pre&s;&s;ed with great Acrimony. It took notice of many di&s;|cour&s;es of calling a new Parliament, at lea&s;t of admitting tho&s;e Mem|bers to &s;it in the pre&s;ent Parliament, who had been excluded in the year <MILESTONE N="20"> 1648; <Q>&startq;&endq;either of which, the Petitioners &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;would prove the inevi|table&endq; de&s;truction of all the Godly in the Land:</Q> <Q>and therefore they be&s;ought them with all earne&s;tne&s;s, &startq;that no Per&s;on what&s;oever might be admitted to the exerci&s;e of any Office or Function in the State, or in the Church, no not &s;o much as to teach a School, who did not fir&s;t take the Oath of Abjuration of the King, and of all his Family, and that he would never &s;ubmit to the Government of any One &s;ingle Per&s;on what&s;oever; and that who&s;oever &s;hould pre&s;ume &s;o much as to pro|po&s;e, or mention the Re&s;toration of the King in Parliament, or any other place, &s;hould be adjudged guilty of, and condemn'd for High-Trea&s;on.&endq;</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THIS Petition was receiv'd with great approbation by the Hou&s;e, their Affection much applauded, and the thanks of the Parliament very &s;olemnly return'd by the Speaker: all which information the General receiv'd at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> when he return'd out of the City; and was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk<HI>'s chief Officers di&s;con|tented at this neglect of the Parliament of their General.</HI></NOTE> pre&s;ently attended by his chief Officers; <Q>who, with open mouths, in|veighed again&s;t the proceedings of the Parliament, &startq;their manife&s;t in|gratitude to him, and the indignity offer'd to him, in giving &s;uch coun|tenance to a rabble of infamous Varlets, who de&s;ired to &s;et the whole Kingdom in a flame, to comply with their Fanatick and mad Enthu|&s;ia&s;mes; <MILESTONE N="40"> and that the Parliament would never have admitted &s;uch an infamous Addre&s;s with approbation, except they had fir&s;t re&s;olv'd upon His ruin and de&s;truction; which he was a&s;&s;uredly to look for, if he&endq; did not prevent it by his Wi&s;dom, and Sagacity;</Q> and thereupon told him of the under-hand Endeavours which were u&s;ed to work upon the Affections of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>THE General had been prepared, by the conferences of <HI>Scot</HI> and <HI>Ro|bin&s;on</HI> in the march, to expect, that, a&s;&s;oon as he came to the Parlia|ment, he mu&s;t take the Oath of Abjuration of the King and his Family. <Q>And therefore they had advi&s;ed him &startq;to offer the taking it him&s;elf, be|fore <MILESTONE N="50"> it &s;hould be propo&s;ed to him, as a matter that would confirm all&endq; Men in an entire confidence in him.</Q> When he came to the Parlia|ment, they forbore, that day, to mention it, being a day dedicated only
<PB N="559" REF="5690">
to care&s;s him, and to give him thanks, in which it could not be &s;ea|&s;onable to mingle any thing of di&s;tru&s;t. But they meant roundly to have pre&s;&s;ed him to it, if this la&s;t opportunity, which they look'd upon as a better earne&s;t of his fidelity, had not fallen out; and they thought he had not then taken any &s;uch re&s;olution, as would have made him pau&s;e in the giving them that &s;atisfaction. But being now awaken'd by <NOTE PLACE="marg">This $Span$ him</NOTE> this Alarm from his Officers, and the temper they were in, and his flegm a little curdled, he begun to think him&s;elf in danger; and that this body of Men, that was called the Parliament, had not reputation enough to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, and tho&s;e who adher'd to them. He had ob&s;erv'd <MILESTONE N="10"> throughout the Kingdom, as he marched, how de&s;picable they were in the e&s;timation of all Men, who gave them no other term or appellation but the <HI>Rump,</HI> as the fag end of a Carca&s;e long &s;ince expired. All that night was &s;pent in con&s;ultation with his Officers; nor did he then form any other de&s;ign than &s;o to unite his Army to him, that they might not leave him in any re&s;olution he &s;hould think &s;it to take.</P>
<P>IN the morning, which was very &s;oon after he had broken the Gates <NOTE PLACE="marg">He $Word$ again into the City, and &s;end: an expo&s;tula+tory Letter to the Parlia+ment.</NOTE> and the hearts of the City, he called his Army again together, and march'd with it into <HI>London,</HI> taking up his own Quarters at an Alder|man's Hou&s;e. <Q>At the &s;ame time he left <HI>White-Hall,</HI> he &s;ent a Letter <MILESTONE N="20"> to the Parliament, in which he roundly took notice of &startq;their unrea|&s;onable, unju&s;t, and unpolitick proceedings; of their abetting and countenancing wicked, and unchri&s;tian Tenents in reference to Reli|gion, and &s;uch as would root out the practice of any Religion; of their underhand corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e very Per&s;ons whom they had declared to be Enemies, and who had been principally in&s;trumental in all the affronts and indignities they had undergone, in and after&endq; their di&s;&s;olution.</Q> <Q>Thereupon he advi&s;ed them in &s;uch Terms as they could not but under&s;tand for the mo&s;t peremptory Command, &startq;that, in&endq; &s;uch a time (a time pre&s;cribed in his Letter)</Q> <Q>&startq;they would i&s;&s;ue out Writs for a new Parliament, that &s;o their own &s;itting might be deter|mined; <MILESTONE N="30"> which was the only Expedient, that could return peace and happine&s;s to the Kingdom, and which both the Army and Kingdom&endq; expected at their hands.</Q> This Letter was no &s;ooner deliver'd to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Letter to the Parlia|ment printed and di&s;per&s;ed.</NOTE> Hou&s;e, than it was printed, and carefully publi&s;hed, and di&s;per&s;ed throughout the City, to the end that they who had been &s;o lately and &s;o wofully di&s;appointed, might &s;ee how throughly he was embarked, and &s;o entertain no new Jealou&s;ies of him.</P>
<P>AFTER he had dined with the Lord Mayor, and di&s;po&s;ed his Army in &s;uch a manner and order as he thought fit, he de&s;ired Him, and the <MILESTONE N="40"> Aldermen, with the Common Council, to meet him at the <HI>Guild-Hall;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">He meets the Lord Mayor and Common Council, ex|cu&s;es what was pa&s;t, and pro|mi&s;es to &s;tand by them, and They by him. Great re|joicing in the City upon it</NOTE> where, after many Excu&s;es for the work of the other day, they plighted their troth each to other in &s;uch a manner, for the perfect Union and adhering to each other for the future, that, a&s;&s;oon as they came from thence, the Lord Mayor attended the General to his Lodgings, and all the Bells of the City proclaim'd, and te&s;tified to the Town and King|dom, that the Army and the City were of one mind. And a&s;&s;oon as the Evening came, there was a continued light of Bone-fires throughout the City and Suburbs, with &s;uch an univer&s;al exclamation of joy, as had never been known, and cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, with &s;uch ridiculous <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;igns of Scorn and Contempt of the Parliament, as te&s;tified the no-regard, or rather the notable dete&s;tation they had of it; there being &s;carce a Bone-fire at which they did not roa&s;t a Rump, and pieces of fle&s;h made

<P>IN &s;uch a huddle and mixture of loo&s;e People of all conditions, and &s;uch a tran&s;port of Affections, it could not be otherwi&s;e but that &s;ome Men would drink the King's Health; which was taken no notice of; nor was it known that one Per&s;on of condition did once pre&s;ume to mention him. All this, how much &s;oever it amazed and di&s;tracted the Parliament, did not &s;o di&s;hearten them, but that they continued &s;till to <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;it, and proceeded in all things with their u&s;ual confidence. They were not willing to de&s;pair of recovering their General again to them; and, to that purpo&s;e, they &s;ent a Committee to treat with him, and to make <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment &s;ent &s;ome Members to treat with him.</NOTE> all &s;uch profers to him as they conceiv'd were mo&s;t like to comply with his Ambition. The entertainment he gave this Committee, was the engaging them in a conference with another Committee of the excluded <NOTE PLACE="marg">He engages them in a con|ference with &s;ome &s;ecluded Members.</NOTE> Members, to the end that he might be &s;atisfied by hearing both, how one could have right to &s;it there as a Parliament, and the other be ex|cluded: <Q>and when he had heard them all, he made no &s;cruple to declare, &startq;that in ju&s;tice the &s;ecluded Members ought to be admitted before the&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> calling another Parliament, and the di&s;&s;olution of this.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER He had put the City into the po&s;ture they de&s;ired, and found no danger threaten'd him from thence, he return'd again to his Quarters <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns to</HI> White-Hall.</NOTE> in <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and di&s;po&s;ed his Army to tho&s;e Po&s;ts which he judged mo&s;t convenient. <Q>He then &s;ent for the Members of the Parliament to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sends for Members of both Parties.</NOTE> come to him, and many others who had been excluded, and lamented &startq;the &s;ad condition the Kingdom was in, which he principally imputed to the di&s;union, and divi&s;ions, which had ari&s;en in Parliament among tho&s;e who were faithful to the Common-wealth: that he had had ma|ny Conferences with them together, and was &s;atisfied by tho&s;e Gen|tlemen, <MILESTONE N="30"> who had been excluded, of their integrity; and therefore he had de&s;ired this Conference between them, that he might communi|cate his own thoughts to them; in doing whereof, that he might not be mi&s;taken in his Delivery, or mi&s;apprehended in his Expre&s;&s;ions,&endq; as he had lately been, he had put what he had a mind to &s;ay in writing;</Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">He delivers his mind to them in a paper.</NOTE> which he Commanded his Secretary to read to them: and was as follows.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;AND as to a Government in the Church, the want whereof hath been no &s;mall Cau&s;e of the&s;e Nations di&s;tractions, it is mo&s;t manife&s;t, that if it be Monarchical in the State, the Church mu&s;t follow, and Prelacy mu&s;t be brought in; which the&s;e Nations, I know, cannot&endq; bear, and again&s;t which they have &s;o &s;olemnly Sworn.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;AND indeed moderate, not rigid Presbyterian Government, with a <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ufficient Liberty for Con&s;ciences truly tender, appears at pre&s;ent to be the mo&s;t indifferent and acceptable way to the Church's &s;ettle|ment.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THE main thing that &s;eems to lye in the way, is the Intere&s;t of the Lords, even of tho&s;e Lords who have &s;hew'd them&s;elves Noble in|deed, by joyning with the People, and in defence of tho&s;e ju&s;t Rights have adventured their deare&s;t Blood and large E&s;tates. To that I &s;hall only &s;ay, that though the &s;tate of the&s;e Nations be &s;uch, as cannot bear their &s;itting in a di&s;tinct Hou&s;e; yet, certainly, the Wi&s;dom of <MILESTONE N="50"> Parliament will find out &s;uch Hereditary Marks of Honour for them,&endq; as may make them more Noble in after Ages.</Q></P>

<P N="1">1. <Q>&startq;To the &s;ettling the Conduct of the Armies of the Three Nations in that manner, as they may be &s;erviceable to the Peace and Safety of them, and not to its own, and the Nations ruin, by Faction and Di|vi&s;ion.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>DIVERS who heard this, thought there was no di&s;&s;imulation in it, in order to cover and conceal his good intentions for the King: for, <MILESTONE N="40"> without doubt, he had not to this hour &s;eem'd to them to have any purpo&s;e, or thought to &s;erve him, but appear'd to be really of the opi|nion he expre&s;&s;ed in his Paper, that it was a work impo&s;&s;ible. So that they thought he de&s;ired nothing, but that he might &s;ee a Common-wealth e&s;tabli&s;h'd in &s;uch a Model as <HI>Holland</HI> was, where he had been bred; and that him&s;elf might enjoy the authority and place which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in that Government. He had not, from his march|ing out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to this time, had much publick conver&s;ation with any Per&s;ons who had &s;erv'd the King; nor had he hitherto, or for &s;ome time after, did he &s;et one of the King's Friends at Liberty, though all the Pri&s;ons were full of them; but on the contrary, they were every <MILESTONE N="50"> day committed by the Rump-Parliament; and with them it was guilt enough to be &s;u&s;pected but to wi&s;h for the King's Re&s;toration.</P>

AS SOON as the Conference above-mention'd was ended with the Members of the Parliament, They who had been excluded from the year 1648, repair'd to the Hou&s;e on <HI>Feb.</HI> the 21^&s;^t, and without any in|terruption, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The &s;econded Members go to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Tran&s;|actions there.</P></NOTE> which they had hitherto found, took their places; and being &s;uperior in number to the re&s;t, they fir&s;t repealed and aboli&s;h'd all the Orders by which they had been excluded; then they provided for Him who had &s;o well provided for Them, by renewing and enlarging the Ge|neral's Commi&s;&s;ion, and revoking all other Commi&s;&s;ions which had been granted to any to meddle with, or a&s;&s;ign Quarters to any part of the Forces.</P>
<P>THEY who had &s;ate before, had put the whole Militia of the King|dom <MILESTONE N="10"> into the hands of Sectaries, Per&s;ons generally of no degree or qua|lity, and notorious only for &s;ome new Tenent in Religion, and for &s;ome barbarity exerci&s;ed upon the King's Party.

<P>WHEN the King, who had rather an imagination, than an expecta|tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's A&s;&s;airs at</HI> Bru&s;&s;els <HI>during this time.</HI></NOTE> that the march of General <HI>Monk</HI> to <HI>London</HI> with his Army might produce &s;ome alteration that might be u&s;eful to him, heard of his entire <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Parliament, and of his entring the City, and di&s;arm|ing it, the Commitment of the principal Citizens, and breaking their Gates and Portculli&s;es, all the little remainder of his hopes was extin|gui&s;hed, and he had nothing left before his Eyes but a perpetual Exile, attended with all tho&s;e di&s;comforts, whereof he had too long Experience, and which, he mu&s;t now expect, would be improved with the wor&s;t circum&s;tances of neglect, which u&s;e to wait upon that condition. A greater con&s;ternation and dejection of mind cannot be imagin'd than at that time cover'd the &s;mall Court of the King; but God did not &s;uffer him long to be wrapp'd up in that melancholic Cloud. As the General's <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;econd march into the City was within two or three days after his fir&s;t, and di&s;pell'd the mi&s;ts and fogs which the other had rai&s;ed, &s;o the very
<PB N="564" REF="5740">
Evening of that day which had brought the News of the fir&s;t in the Mor|ning, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King hears on the &s;ame day of both the marches of the General into the City.</NOTE> brought likewi&s;e an Account to his Maje&s;ty of the &s;econd, with all the circum&s;tances of Bells, and Bonefires, and burning of Rumps, and &s;uch other Additions, as might rea&s;onably be true, and which a willing Relator would not omit.</P>
<P>WHEN it begun to be dark, the Lord Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> brought a young Man with him to the Chancellor's Lodging at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI> which was under the King's Bed-chamber, and to which his Maje&s;ty every day vouch&s;afed to come for the di&s;patch of any bu&s;ine&s;s. <Q>The Marquis &s;aid no more but &startq;that that Man had formerly been an Officer under him, <MILESTONE N="10"> and he believed he was an hone&s;t Man; be&s;ides, that he brought a line or two of Credit from a Per&s;on they would both believe; but that his di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o &s;trange and extravagant, that he knew not what to&endq; think of it;</Q> however, he would call the King to judge; and &s;o went out of the Room leaving the Man there, and immediately return'd with the King.</P>
<P>THE Man's name was <HI>Baily;</HI> who had liv'd mo&s;t in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had &s;erv'd there as a Foot Officer under the Marquis. He looked as if he had drank much, or &s;lept little: <Q>his Relation was, &startq;that in the Af|ternoon of &s;uch a day, he was with S^r <HI>John Stephens</HI> in <HI>Lambeth</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> Hou&s;e, u&s;ed then as a Pri&s;on for many of the King's friends; where, whil&s;t they were in conference together, News was brought into the Hou&s;e by &s;everal Per&s;ons, that the General was marched with his whole Army into the City (it being within two or three days after he had been there, and broke down their Gates, and pull'd down their Po&s;ts) and that he had a conference with the Mayor and Aldermen; which was no &s;ooner ended, but that all the City Bells rang out; and He heard the Bells very plain at <HI>Lambeth:</HI> and that he &s;taid there &s;o late, till they &s;aw the Bonefires burning and flaming in the City: upon which S^r <HI>John Stephens</HI> had de&s;ired him, that he would immediately <MILESTONE N="30"> cro&s;s the River, and go into <HI>London,</HI> and inquire what the matter was; and if he found any thing extraordinary in it, that he would take Po&s;t, and make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> that the King might be inform'd of it; and &s;o gave him a &s;hort Note in Writing to the Marquis of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> that he might believe all that the Me&s;&s;enger would inform him: that thereupon he went over the River, walked through <HI>Cheap|&s;ide,</HI> &s;aw the Bonefires, and the King's health drank in &s;everal places, heard all that the General had done, and brought a Copy of the Let|ter which the General had &s;ent to the Parliament, at the time when he return'd with his Army into the City; and then told many things,&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> which were, he &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;publickly &s;poken, concerning &s;ending for the King: that then he took Po&s;t for <HI>Dover,</HI> and hired a Bark that brought&endq; him to <HI>O&s;tend.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE time was &s;o &s;hort from the hour he left <HI>London,</HI> that the ex|pedition of his journey was incredible; nor could any man undertake to come from thence in &s;o &s;hort a time, upon the mo&s;t important Affair, and for the greate&s;t reward. It was evident by many pau&s;es and he&s;ita|tions in his di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;ome Repetitions, that the Man was not compo&s;ed, and at be&s;t wanted &s;leep; yet his Relation could not be a meer fiction and imagination. S^r <HI>John Stephens</HI> was a Man well known <MILESTONE N="50"> to his Maje&s;ty, and the other two; and had been &s;ent over lately by the King, with &s;ome advice to his friends; and it was well known, that he had been apprehended at his landing, and was &s;ent Pri&s;oner to <HI>Lam|beth</HI>
<PB N="565" REF="5750">
Hou&s;e. And though he had not mention'd in his Note any parti|culars, yet he had given him credit, and nothing but the Man's own Devotion to the King could rea&s;onably tempt him to undertake &s;o hazardous and chargeable a journey. Then the General's Letter to the Parliament was of the highe&s;t moment, and not like to be feign'd; and upon the whole matter, the King thought he had Argument to rai&s;e his own Spirits, and that he &s;hould do but ju&s;tly in communicating his Intelligence to his di&s;pirited Family, and Servants; who, upon the News thereof, were revived proportionably to the de&s;pair they had &s;wal|low'd; and, according to the temper of Men who had lain under long <MILESTONE N="10"> di&s;con&s;olation, thought all their Sufferings over; and laid in a &s;tock of &s;uch va&s;t hopes, as would be very hard for any &s;ucce&s;s to procure &s;a|tisfaction for.</P>
<P>BUT the King, who thanked God for this new dawning of hope, and was much refre&s;h'd with this unexpected Alteration, was yet re&s;train'd from any confidence that this would produce any &s;uch Revolution as would be &s;ufficient to do his work; towards which he &s;aw cau&s;e enough to de&s;pair of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any Foreign power. The mo&s;t that he could collect from the General's Letter, be&s;ides the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent Tyranny of the Rump-Parliament, was, that, po&s;&s;ibly, at la&s;t the ex|cluded <MILESTONE N="20"> Members might be again admitted, and, it may be, able to go|vern that Council. And even this Admini&s;ter'd no &s;olid ground of com|fort or confidence to his Maje&s;ty. Several of tho&s;e excluded Members had not been true Members of Parliament, but elected, after the end of the War, into Their places who had been expelled for adhering to the King; and &s;o they had no title to &s;it there, but what the counter|feit Great Seal had given them, without, and again&s;t the King's Autho|rity. It was thought the&s;e Men, with others who had been Lawfully cho&s;en, were willing, and de&s;irous, that the Conce&s;&s;ions made by the late King at the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> might be accepted; which in truth did, <MILESTONE N="30"> with the pre&s;ervation of the Name and Life of the King, near as much e&s;tabli&s;h a Republican Government, as was &s;ettled after his Murther; and becau&s;e they would in&s;i&s;t upon that, they were, with tho&s;e circum|&s;tances of force and violence, which are formerly mention'd, excluded from the Hou&s;e; without which that horrid Villany could never have been committed.</P>
<P>NOW what could the King rea&s;onably expect from the&s;e Men's re|admi&s;&s;ion into the Government, but that they would re&s;ume their old Conclu&s;ions, and pre&s;s him to con&s;ent to his Father's Conce&s;&s;ions? which his late Maje&s;ty yielded to with much le&s;s chearfulne&s;s, than he <MILESTONE N="40"> walked to the Scaffold; <Q>though it was upon the promi&s;e of many power|ful Men then in the Parliament, &startq;that he &s;hould not be obliged to ac|compli&s;h&endq; that Agreement.</Q> The&s;e Revolvings wrought much upon his Maje&s;ty, though he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to appear plea&s;ed with what he had heard, and to expect much greater things from it; which yet he knew not how to contribute to, till he &s;hould receive a farther Account from <HI>London</HI> of the Revolutions there.</P>
<P>INDEED, when all his Maje&s;ty had heard before, was confirm'd by &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es, who pa&s;&s;ed with much freedom, and were every day &s;ent by his Friends, who had recover'd their Courage to the full, and <MILESTONE N="50"> di&s;cerned that the&s;e excluded Members were principally admitted to prepare for the calling a New Parliament, and to be &s;ure to make the di&s;&s;olution of this unque&s;tionable and certain, the King recover'd his
<PB N="566" REF="5760">
hopes again; which were every day increa&s;ed by the Addre&s;&s;es of many Men, who had never before applied them&s;elves to him; and many &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many now apply to the King. The Council of State's kind behaviour now to the King's Friends.</NOTE> to him for his Maje&s;ty's approbation and leave to &s;erve and &s;it in the next Parliament. And from the time that the Parliament was di&s;&s;olv'd, the Council of State behaved them&s;elves very civilly towards his Ma|je&s;ty's Friends, and relea&s;ed many of them out of Pri&s;on: particularly <HI>Anne&s;ley,</HI> when Pre&s;ident of the Council, was very well contented that the King &s;hould receive particular Information of His Devotion, and of his Re&s;olution to do him Service; which he manife&s;ted in many par|ticulars of importance, and had the Courage to receive a Letter from <MILESTONE N="10"> his Maje&s;ty, and return'd a dutiful An&s;wer to it: all which had a very good a&s;pect, and &s;eem'd to promi&s;e much good. Yet the King knew not what to think of the General's Paper, which he had deliver'd at his Conference with the Members; for which he could &s;eem to have no temptation, but his violent Affection to a Common-wealth. Few or None of his Maje&s;ty's Friends could find any means of addre&s;s to him; yet they did believe, and were much the better for believing it, that the King had &s;ome &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with him. <Q>And &s;ome of them &s;ent to the King, &startq;of what importance it would be, that he gave them &s;ome credit, or means of Acce&s;s to the General, by which they might <MILESTONE N="20"> receive his Order and Direction in &s;uch things as occurr'd on the &s;ud|dain, and that they might be &s;ure to do nothing that might cro&s;s any purpo&s;e of His. To which the King return'd no other An&s;wer, but that they &s;hould have patience, and make no Attempt what&s;oever;&endq; and that in due time they &s;hould receive all Adverti&s;ements nece&s;&s;ary;</Q> it being not thought fit to di&s;claim having intelligence with, or hopes of the General; &s;ince it was very evident, that the receiv'd opinion, that he did de&s;ign to &s;erve the King, or that he would be at la&s;t obliged to do it, whether he de&s;ign'd to do it or no, did really as much contri|bute to the Advancement of his Maje&s;ty's Service, as if he had dedi|cated <MILESTONE N="30"> him&s;elf to it. And the A&s;&s;urance, that the other Party thought they had, that he had no &s;uch Intention, hinder'd tho&s;e ob&s;tructions, jealou&s;ies, and interruptions, which very probably might have le&s;&s;en'd his credit with his own Army, or united all the re&s;t of the Forces again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd likewi&s;e at this time a bu&s;ine&s;s that very much troubled the King, and might very probably have de&s;troy'd all the hopes that began to flatter him. Upon the Di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament, which put an end to all the power and authority of tho&s;e who had been the chief In&s;truments of all the mon&s;trous things which had been done, <MILESTONE N="40"> the highe&s;t de&s;pair &s;ei&s;ed upon all who had been the late King's Judges; who were &s;ure to find as hard mea&s;ure from the &s;ecluded Members, as they were to expect if the King him&s;elf had been re&s;tored. And all they who had afterwards concurr'd with them, and exerci&s;ed the &s;ame power, who were call'd the <HI>Rump,</HI> believ'd their ruin and de&s;truction to be certain, and at hand. And therefore they contrived all the ways they could to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, and to prevent the a&s;&s;embling a new Par|liament; which if they could interrupt, they made no doubt but the Rump Members would again re&s;ume the Government, notwith&s;tand|ing their Di&s;&s;olution by the power of the &s;ecluded Members; who <MILESTONE N="50"> would then pay dear for their pre&s;umption and intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO this purpo&s;e, they employ'd their Agents among&s;t the Officers and Soldiers of the Army, who had been di&s;gracefully remov'd from
<PB N="567" REF="5770">
their Quarters in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and the parts adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> to make room for General <HI>Monk</HI>'s Army; which was now look'd upon as the &s;ole Confiding part of the Army. And they inflamed the&s;e Men with the &s;en&s;e of their own de&s;perate condition; who, having &s;erved throughout the War, &s;hould, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of all the Arrears of Pay due to them, be now offer'd as a &s;acrifice to the Cavaliers, whom they had conquer'd, and who, they &s;uppo&s;ed, were implacably incen&s;ed again&s;t them. Nor did they omit to make the &s;ame infu&s;ions into the Soldiers of General <HI>Monk</HI>'s Army, who had all the &s;ame title to the &s;ame fears and apprehen&s;ions. And when their minds were thus pre|pared, <MILESTONE N="10"> and ready to declare upon the fir&s;t opportunity, <HI>Lambert</HI> made his e&s;cape out of the Tower; his Party having in all places &s;o many of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lamberts <HI>e&s;cape out of the Tower</HI></NOTE> their Combination, that they could compa&s;s their de&s;igns of that kind whenever they thought fit; though the General had as great a jealou&s;y of this Man's e&s;cape, as of any thing that could fall out to &s;upplant him. And therefore, it may be pre&s;umed, he took all po&s;&s;ible care to prevent it: and they who then had Command of the place, were notoriou&s;ly known neither to love <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Per&s;on, nor to favour his De&s;igns.</P>
<P>THIS e&s;cape of <HI>Lambert</HI> in &s;uch a conjuncture, the mo&s;t perilous that it could fall out in, put the General, and the Council of State, into a great agony. They knew well what Poy&s;on had been &s;catter'd about <MILESTONE N="20"> the Army, and what impre&s;&s;ion it had made in the Soldiers. <HI>Lambert</HI> was the mo&s;t popular Man, and had the greate&s;t Influence upon them. And though they had lately de&s;erted him, they had &s;ufficiently publi&s;h'd their remor&s;e, and their dete&s;tation of tho&s;e who had &s;educed and cou|&s;en'd them. So that there was little doubt to be made, now he was at liberty, but that they would flock and re&s;ort to him, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould know where to find him. On the other hand, no &s;mall danger was threaten'd from the very drawing the Army together to a Ren|dezvous in order to pro&s;ecute and oppo&s;e him, no Man being able to make a judgement what they would choo&s;e to do in &s;uch a conjuncture, <MILESTONE N="30"> when they were &s;o full of jealou&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfaction. And it may very rea&s;onably be believed, that if he had, after he found him&s;elf at liberty, lain conceal'd, till he had dige&s;ted the Method he meant to proceed in, and procured &s;ome place to which the Troops might re&s;ort to declare with him, when he &s;hould appear (which had been very ea&s;y then for him to have done) he would have gone near to have &s;haken at lea&s;t the Model the General had made.</P>
<P>BUT either through the fear of his &s;ecurity, and being betray'd into the hands of his Enemies (as all kind of treachery was at that time very active; of which he had experience) or the pre&s;umption, that the Ar|my <MILESTONE N="40"> would obey him upon his fir&s;t Call; and that, if he could draw a &s;mall part to him, the re&s;t would never appear again&s;t him; he preci|pitated him&s;elf to make an attempt, before he was ready for it, or It for Him; and &s;o put it into his Enemy's power to di&s;appoint, and con|trole all his de&s;igns. He &s;taid not at all in <HI>London,</HI> as it was his Intere&s;t to have done, but ha&s;ten'd into the Country; and tru&s;ting a Gen|tleman in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> whom he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of, the Ge|neral had quickly notice in what Quarter he was: yet, with great ex|pedition, <HI>Lambert</HI> drew four Troops of the Army to him, with which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He draws four Troops of the Army to him near</HI> Daven+try</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"> he had the courage to appear near <HI>Daventry</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> a Country famous for di&s;affection to the King, and for adhering to the Parliament; where he pre&s;umed he &s;hould be attended by other parts
<PB N="568" REF="5780">
of the Army, before it &s;hould be known at <HI>White-Hall</HI> where he was, and that any Forces could be &s;ent from thence again&s;t him: of which, he doubted not, from his many friends, he &s;hould have &s;ea&s;onable Notice.</P>
<P>BUT the General, upon his fir&s;t &s;ecret intimation of his being in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> and of the cour&s;e he meant to take, had committed it to the charge and care of Colonel <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> (who was well known to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The General &s;ends</HI> Ingolds|by <HI>again&s;t him with his own Regiment, and a Body of Foot under Colonel</HI> Streater.</NOTE> be very willing and de&s;irous to take revenge upon <HI>Lambert,</HI> for his ma|lice to <HI>Oliver</HI> and <HI>Richard,</HI> and the Affront he had him&s;elf receiv'd from him) to attend and watch all his Motions with his own Regiment <MILESTONE N="10"> of Hor&s;e; which was the more faithful to him for having been before &s;educed by <HI>Lambert</HI> to de&s;ert him. <HI>Ingoldsby,</HI> being joyn'd with a good Body of Foot under Colonel <HI>Streater,</HI> u&s;ed &s;o much diligence in wait|ing upon <HI>Lambert</HI>'s motion, before he was &s;u&s;pected to be &s;o near, that one of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s four Captains fell into the hands of his forlorne hope; who made him Pri&s;oner, and brought him to their Colonel. The Captain was very well known to <HI>Ingoldsby;</HI> <Q>who, after &s;ome conference with him, gave him his Liberty, upon his promi&s;e, &startq;that he would&endq; him&s;elf retire to his Hou&s;e, and &s;end his Troop to obey his Commands;</Q> which promi&s;e he ob&s;erv'd; and the next day his Troop, under his <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One of</HI> Lam|bert's <HI>Troops revolts to</HI> In|goldsby.</NOTE> Cornet and Quarter-Ma&s;ter, came to <HI>Ingoldsby,</HI> and inform'd him where <HI>Lambert</HI> was. He thereupon made ha&s;t, and was in his view, before the other had notice that he was pur&s;ued by him.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, &s;urpri&s;ed with this di&s;covery, and finding that one of his Troops had for&s;aken him, &s;aw his Enemy much &s;uperior to him in Number; and therefore &s;ent to de&s;ire that they might treat together; which the other was content to do. <Q><HI>Lambert</HI> propo&s;ed to him, &startq;that&endq; they might re&s;tore <HI>Richard</HI> to be Protector;</Q> and promi&s;ed to unite all his credit to the Support of that Intere&s;t. But <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> (be&s;ides that he well under&s;tood the folly and impo&s;&s;ibility of that Undertaking) <MILESTONE N="30"> had devoted him&s;elf to a better Intere&s;t; and adher'd to the General, becau&s;e he pre&s;umed that He did intend to &s;erve the King, and &s;o re|jected this Overture. Whereupon both Parties prepared to fight, when another of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Troops for&s;aking him, and putting them&s;elves <NOTE PLACE="marg">and another al&s;o.</NOTE> under his Enemy, he concluded, that his &s;afety would depend upon his flight; which he thought to &s;ecure by the &s;wiftne&s;s of his Hor&s;e. But <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> keeping his eye &s;till upon him, and being as well hor&s;ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>and his Party di&s;per&s;ed. He and others taken.</HI></NOTE> overtook him, and made him his Pri&s;oner, after he had in vain u&s;ed great and much importunity to him, that he would permit him to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>WITH him were taken <HI>Cobbet, Creed,</HI> and &s;ome other Officers of <MILESTONE N="40"> the greate&s;t Intere&s;t with the Fanatick part of the Army, and who were mo&s;t apprehended by the General, in a time when all the ways were full of Soldiers endeavouring to repair to them: &s;o that, if they had not been cru&s;h'd in that in&s;tant, they would, in very few days, have appear'd very formidable. <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> return'd to <HI>London,</HI> and brought his Pri&s;oners to the Privy Council; who committed <HI>Lambert</HI> again to the Tower with a &s;tricter Charge, with &s;ome other of the Officers; and &s;ent the re&s;t to other Pri&s;ons. This very &s;ea&s;onable Victory look'd to all Men, as a happy Omen to the &s;ucceeding Parliament; which was <MILESTONE N="50"> to a&s;&s;emble &s;oon after the Pri&s;oners were brought before the Council; and would not have appear'd with the &s;ame chearfulne&s;s, if <HI>Lambert</HI> had remain'd &s;till in Armes, or, in truth, if he had been &s;till at liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="569" REF="5790">
IN this &s;hort Interval between the return of the &s;ecluded Members, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment's and Council of State's pru|dent Actions</NOTE> and the Convention of the new Parliament, many prudent Actions and Alterations (be&s;ides what have been already mention'd) were begun by that Parliament, before it was di&s;&s;olv'd, and fini&s;h'd afterwards by the Council of State; which were good Pre&s;ages, that the future Councils would proceed with Moderation. They relea&s;ed S^r <HI>George Booth</HI> from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Before the A&s;&s;embling of the new Par|liament they relea&s;e S</HI> G Booth.</NOTE> his impri&s;onment, that he might be elected to &s;it in the en&s;uing Parlia|ment, as he &s;hortly after was; and they &s;et at liberty all tho&s;e who had been committed for adhering to him. Tho&s;e of the King's Party who had &s;helter'd them&s;elves in ob&s;curity, appear'd now abroad, and con|ver&s;ed without controle; and M^r <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> who was known to be en|tirely <MILESTONE N="10"> tru&s;ted by the King, walked into all places with freedom; and many of the Council, and &s;ome Officers of the Army, as <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> and <HI>Huntington, &amp;c.</HI> made, through Him, tender of their Services to the King.</P>
<P>BUT that which &s;eem'd of mo&s;t importance, was the reformation <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They reform the Navy $|ma$ing</HI> Mon$$ <HI>and</HI> Mounta|gue <HI>Admirals</HI></NOTE> they made in the Navy; which was full of Sectaries, and under the Go|vernment of tho&s;e who of all Men were declared the mo&s;t Republican. The pre&s;ent Fleet prepared for the Summer Service, was under the Command of Vice-Admiral <HI>Law&s;on;</HI> an excellent Seaman, but then a <MILESTONE N="20"> notorious Anabapti&s;t; who had fill'd the Fleet with Officers, and Ma|riners, of the &s;ame principles. And they well remember'd, how he had lately be&s;ieged the City; and, by the power of his Fleet, given that turn which helped to ruin <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> and re&s;tore the Rump-Parliament to the exerci&s;e of their juri&s;diction; for which he &s;tood high in reputation with all that Party. The Parliament re&s;olv'd, though they thought it not fit or &s;afe to remove <HI>Law&s;on,</HI> yet &s;o far to eclip&s;e him, that he &s;hould not have it &s;o ab&s;olutely in his power to controle Them, as he had done <HI>the Committee of Safety.</HI> In order to this they concluded, that they would call <HI>Mountague,</HI> who had lain <MILESTONE N="30"> privately in his own Hou&s;e, under a Cloud, and Jealou&s;y of being in|clined too much to the King, and make Him and the General (who was not to be left out in any thing) joynt Admirals of the Fleet; whereby <HI>Mountague</HI> only would go to Sea, and have the Ships under his Com|mand; by which he might take care for good Officers, and Seamen, for &s;uch other Ships as they meant to add to the Fleet, and would be able to ob&s;erve, if not reform the re&s;t. <HI>Mountague</HI> &s;ent privately over to the King for his Approbation, before he would accept the Charge; which being &s;peedily &s;ent to him, he came to <HI>London,</HI> and enter'd into that joynt Command with the General; and immediately applied him|&s;elf <MILESTONE N="40"> to put the Fleet into &s;o good order, that he might comfortably &s;erve in it. Since there was no Man who betook him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty's Service with more genero&s;ity than this Gentleman, it is fit in this place to enlarge concerning him, and the corre&s;pondence which he held with the King.</P>
<P>MOUNTAGUE was of a Noble Family, of which &s;ome were too <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of Admiral</HI> Mountague</NOTE> much addicted to innovations in Religion, and in the beginning of the Troubles, appear'd again&s;t the King; though his Father, who had been long a Servant to the Crown, never could be prevailed upon to &s;werve from his Allegiance, and took all the care he could to re&s;train this his <MILESTONE N="50"> only Son within tho&s;e limits: but being young, and more out of his Father's controle by being Married into a Family, which, at that time, al&s;o trod awry, he was &s;o far wrought upon by the care&s;&s;es of <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
<PB N="570" REF="5800">
that, out of pure affection to him, he was per&s;waded to take Com|mand in the Army, when it was new modelled under <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and when he was little more than twenty years of Age. He &s;erv'd in that Army in the condition of a Colonel to the end of the War, with the reputa|tion of a very &s;tout and &s;ober young Man. And from that time <HI>Crom|well,</HI> to whom he pa&s;&s;ionately adher'd, took him into his neare&s;t con|fidence, and &s;ent him, fir&s;t, joyn'd in Commi&s;&s;ion with <HI>Blake;</HI> and then, in the &s;ole Command by Sea; in which he was di&s;creet and &s;ucce&s;sful. And though Men look'd upon him as devoted to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Intere&s;t, in all other re&s;pects he behaved him&s;elf with civility to all Men, and without the lea&s;t &s;hew of acrimony towards any who had &s;erv'd the <MILESTONE N="10"> King; and was &s;o much in love with Monarchy, that he was one of tho&s;e who mo&s;t de&s;ired and advi&s;ed <HI>Cromwell</HI> to accept, and a&s;&s;ume that Title, when it was offer'd to him by his Parliament. He was de|&s;ign'd by him to Command the Fleet that was to mediate, as was pre|tended, in the <HI>Sound</HI> between the two Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> but was, in truth, to hinder the <HI>Dutch</HI> from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Dane</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Swede;</HI> with whom <HI>Oliver</HI> was engaged in an in&s;eparable Alliance. He was upon this Expedition, when <HI>Richard</HI> was &s;cornfully thrown out of the Protector-&s;hip; and was afterwards joyn'd (for they knew not <MILESTONE N="20"> how to leave him out, whil&s;t he had that Command) with <HI>Alger|noon Sidney,</HI> and the other Plenipotentiaries which the Rump-Parlia|ment &s;ent to reconcile tho&s;e Crowns. A&s;&s;oon as <HI>Richard</HI> was &s;o ca&s;t down, the King thought <HI>Mountague</HI>'s relations and obligations were at an end, and was advi&s;ed by tho&s;e who knew him, to invite him to his Service.</P>
<P>THERE accompanied him at that time <HI>Edward Mountague,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of the Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> of <HI>Boughton,</HI> and his near Kin&s;man; with whom he had a particular friend&s;hip. This Gentleman was not unknown to the King, and very well known to the Chancellor, to have good Affections and Re&s;olutions; and one who, by the corre&s;pondence <MILESTONE N="30"> that was between them, he knew, had undertaken that unplea&s;ant Voyage, only to di&s;po&s;e his Cou&s;in to lay hold of the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty. At this time S^r <HI>George Booth</HI> appear'd, and all tho&s;e de&s;igns were laid, which, it was rea&s;onably hoped, would engage the whole Kingdom again&s;t that odious part of the Parliament which was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Government. And it was now thought a very &s;ea&s;onable Conjuncture to make an experiment, whether <HI>Mountague</HI> with his Fleet would declare for the King.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor thereupon prepared &s;uch a Letter in his own Name, <MILESTONE N="40"> as his Maje&s;ty thought proper, to invite him to that re&s;olution, from the di&s;traction of the times, and the determination of all tho&s;e Mo|tives which had in his youth fir&s;t provoked him to the engagements he had been in. <Q>He inform'd him of &startq;S^r <HI>George Booth</HI>'s being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and in the head of an Army; and that his Maje&s;ty was a&s;&s;ured of many other Places; and of a general combination between Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Intere&s;t, to declare for the King; and that, if he would bring his Fleet upon the Coa&s;t, his Maje&s;ty, or the Duke&endq; of <HI>York,</HI> would immediately be on board with him.</Q> This Letter was inclo&s;ed in another to <HI>Edward Mountague,</HI> to be by him deliver'd, <MILESTONE N="50"> or Not deliver'd, as he thought fit; and committed to the care of an Expre&s;s, who was then thought not to be without &s;ome credit with the Admiral him&s;elf; which did not prove true. However, the Me&s;|&s;enger
<PB N="571" REF="5810">
was diligent in pro&s;ecuting his voyage, and arriv'd &s;afely at <HI>Co|penhagen</HI> (where the Fleet lay; and where all the Plenipotentiaries from the Parliament then were) and without difficulty found oppor|tunity to deliver his Letter to the Per&s;on to whom it was directed; who, the &s;ame Night, deliver'd the other to his Cou&s;in. He receiv'd it chearfully, and was well plea&s;ed with the hopes of &s;uddain Revolu|tions in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THEY were both of them puzzled how to behave them&s;elves towards the Me&s;&s;enger, who was not acceptable to them, being very well known to the Fleet, where though he had had good Command, he had no credit; and had appear'd &s;o publickly, by the folly of good fellow&s;hip, <MILESTONE N="10"> that the Admiral, and many others, had &s;een him and taken notice of him, before he knew that he brought any Letter for him. The conclu|&s;ion was, that he &s;hould without delay be &s;ent away, without &s;peaking with the Admiral, or knowing that he knew any thing of his Errand. But <HI>Edward Mountague</HI> writ &s;uch a Letter to the Chancellor, as was evidence enough that his Maje&s;ty would not be di&s;appointed in his ex|pectation of any &s;ervice that the Admiral could perform for him. With this An&s;wer the Me&s;&s;enger return'd to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where there was a great alteration from the time he had left it.</P>
<P>WITHIN few days after this Me&s;&s;enger's withdrawing from <HI>Copen|hagen,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> of who&s;e being there the Plenipotentiaries were &s;o jealous, that they had re&s;olv'd to require of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> that he might be committed to Pri&s;on, Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> declared, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould not be able to &s;tay longer there for the want of Victual; of which he had not more than would &s;erve to carry him home; and therefore de&s;ired, that they would pre&s;s both Kings, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Plenipotentiaries,&endq; to fini&s;h the Negotiation.</Q> By this time the News of the Commotions in <HI>England</HI> made a great noi&s;e, and were reported, according to the Af|fections of the Per&s;ons who &s;ent Letters thither, more to the King's advantage than there was rea&s;on for; and the other Plenipotentiaries <MILESTONE N="30"> came to know, that the Man, of whom they were &s;o jealous, had pri|vately &s;poken with <HI>Edward Mountague;</HI> who was very well known, and very ill thought of by them. And from thence they concluded, that the Admiral, who had never plea&s;ed them, was no &s;tranger to that Negotiation; in which jealou&s;y they were quickly confirm'd, when they &s;aw him with his Fleet under &s;ail, making his cour&s;e for <HI>England,</HI> without giving them any notice, or taking his leave of them; which if he had done, they had &s;ecret Authority from their coming thither (upon the general apprehen&s;ion of his Inclination) to have &s;ecured his Per&s;on on board his own Ship, and to have di&s;po&s;ed of the Government of the <MILESTONE N="40"> Fleet; of which being thus prevented they could do no more than &s;end Expre&s;&s;es over Land, to acquaint the Parliament of his departure, with all the aggravation of his pride, pre&s;umption, and infidelity, which the bitterne&s;s of their nature and wit could &s;ugge&s;t to them.</P>
<P>WHEN the Fleet arriv'd near the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> they found S^r <HI>George Booth</HI> defeated, and all Per&s;ons who pretended any affection for the King, &s;o totally cru&s;hed, and the Rump Parliament in &s;o full exerci&s;e of it's Tyrannical power, <Q>that the Admiral had nothing to do but to ju&s;tify his return &startq;by his &s;carcity of Victual, which mu&s;t have&endq; failed, if he had &s;taid till the Winter had &s;hut him up in the <HI>Sound;</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="50"> and his return was re&s;olv'd upon the joynt Advice of the Flag Officers of the Fleet; there being not a Man but his Cou&s;in, who knew any
<PB N="572" REF="5820">
other rea&s;on of his return, or was privy to his purpo&s;es. So that, a&s;&s;oon as he had pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the Parliament, and laid down his Com|mand, they deferr'd the examination of the whole matter, upon the complaints which they had receiv'd from their Commi&s;&s;ioners, till they could be at more lei&s;ure. For it was then about the time that they grew jealous of <HI>Lambert;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Mountague</HI> went quietly into the Country, and remain'd neglected and forgotten, till tho&s;e Revolutions were over which were produced by <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Inva&s;ion upon the Par|liament, and General <HI>Monk</HI>'s march into <HI>England,</HI> and till near the time that the Name and Title of that Parliament was totally aboli&s;hed, and extingui&s;hed; and then the &s;ecluded Members being re&s;tored call'd him <MILESTONE N="10"> to re&s;ume the Command of the Fleet; which he accepted in the man|ner afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>THIS, together with the other good Symptoms in the State, rai&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's hopes and expectation higher than ever, if it had not been an unplea&s;ant allay, that in &s;o great an alteration, and application of many who had been eminently aver&s;e from his Maje&s;ty, of the General, who only could put an end to all his doubts, there was <HI>altum &s;ilentium;</HI> no Per&s;ons tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty could approach him, nor was any word known to fall from him that could encourage them to go to him, <MILESTONE N="20"> though they &s;till pre&s;umed that he meant well.</P>
<P>THE General was weary and perplexed with his unweildy Burthen, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The General's Coun&s;els at this time.</NOTE> yet knew not how to make it lighter by communication. He &s;pent much time in con&s;ultation with Per&s;ons of every Intere&s;t, the King's Party only excepted; with whom he held no conference; though he found, in his every day's di&s;cour&s;es in the City, with tho&s;e who were thought to be Presbyterians, and with other Per&s;ons of quality and con|&s;ideration, that the People did generally wi&s;h for the King, and that they did believe, there could be no firm and &s;ettled Peace in the Na|tion, that did not comprehend His Intere&s;t, and compo&s;e the prejudice that was again&s;t His Party. But then there mu&s;t be &s;trict conditions to <MILESTONE N="30"> which he mu&s;t be bound, which it &s;hould not be in his Maje&s;ty's power to break; and which might not only &s;ecure all who had borne Armes again&s;t him, but &s;uch who had purcha&s;ed the Lands of the Crown, or of Bi&s;hops, or of Delinquents; and nobody &s;poke more favourably, than for the confirming all that had been offer'd by his Father in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER by invitation, or upon his own de&s;ire, he was pre&s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He had a con|ference with divers at</HI> Northumber|land <HI>Hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE> at <HI>Northumberland</HI> Hou&s;e in a Conference with that Earl, the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and other Lords, and likewi&s;e with <HI>Hollis,</HI> S^r <HI>William</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Waller, Lewis,</HI> and other eminent Per&s;ons, who had a tru&s;t and con|fidence in each other, and who were looked upon as the Heads and Governours of the moderate Presbyterian Party; who, mo&s;t of them, would have been contented, their own &s;ecurity being provided for, that the King &s;hould be re&s;tored to his full Rights, and the Church to it's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. In this Conference, the King's Re&s;toration was propo&s;ed in direct terms, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Peace of the Kingdom, and for the &s;atisfaction of the People; and the que&s;tion &s;eem'd only to be, upon what terms they &s;hould admit him: &s;ome propo&s;ing more moderate, others more &s;evere conditions. In this whole Debate, the <MILESTONE N="50"> General in&s;i&s;ted upon the mo&s;t rigid Propo&s;itions; which he pre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that the Lords grew jealous that he had &s;uch an aver|&s;ion from Re&s;toring the King, that it would not be &s;afe for them then
<PB N="573" REF="5830">
to pro&s;ecute that advice; and therefore it were be&s;t to acquie&s;e till the Parliament met, and that they could make &s;ome judgement of the tem|per of it. And the General, though he con&s;ulted with tho&s;e of every Faction with much freedom, yet was by many then thought to have mo&s;t familiarity, and to conver&s;e mo&s;t freely with S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig,</HI> who was irreconcilable to Monarchy, and looked upon as the Chief of that Republican Party, which de&s;ired not to pre&s;erve any face of Go|vernment in the Church, or Uniformity in the publick exerci&s;e of Re|ligion. This made the Lords, and all others, who were of different af|fections, very wary in their di&s;cour&s;es with the General, and jealous of his Inclinations. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THERE was, at this time, in much conver&s;ation, and tru&s;t with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He con&s;ults with M^r</HI> Mor+rice.</NOTE> the General, a Gentleman of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> of a fair e&s;tate and reputation, one M^r <HI>William Morrice,</HI> a Per&s;on of a retired Life, which he &s;pent in Study, being learned and of good parts; and he had been allways looked upon as a Man far from any malice towards the King, if he had not good Affections for him; which they who knew him be&s;t, believ'd him to have in a good mea&s;ure. This Gentleman was allied to the Ge|neral, and entirely tru&s;ted by him in the management of his e&s;tate in that Country, where, by the death of his elder Brother without Heirs Male, he inherited a fair fortune. And <HI>Morrice,</HI> being cho&s;en to &s;erve <MILESTONE N="20"> in the next en&s;uing Parliament, had made ha&s;t to <HI>London,</HI> the better to ob&s;erve how things were like to go. With Him the General con|&s;ulted freely touching all his perplexities and ob&s;ervations; <Q>how &startq;he found mo&s;t Men of Quality and Intere&s;t inclined to call in the King, but upon &s;uch conditions as mu&s;t be very ungrateful, if po&s;&s;ible to be re|ceiv'd;&endq;</Q> and the <HI>London</HI> Mini&s;ters talked already &s;o loudly of them, that the Covenant being new printed, and, by order fixed up in all Churches, they, in their Sermons, di&s;cour&s;ed of the &s;everal obligations in it, that, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the danger of naming the King, which yet they did not long forbe$r, every body under&s;tood, they thought it <MILESTONE N="30"> nece&s;&s;ary the People &s;hould return to their Allegiance.</P>
<P>THAT which wrought mo&s;t upon the General, was the choice which was begun to be made in all Counties for Members to &s;erve in Parlia|ment; very many of them being known to be of &s;ingular Affection to the King, and very few who did not heartily abhor the Murther of his Father, and dete&s;t the Government that &s;ucceeded: &s;o that it was rea|&s;onably apprehended, that, when they &s;hould once meet, there would be warmth among them, that could not be re&s;train'd or controled; and they might take the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o much into their own hands, as to leave no part to Him to merit of the King; from whom he had yet de&s;erv'd <MILESTONE N="40"> nothing.</P>
<P><Q>M^r MORRICE was not wanting to cultivate tho&s;e conceptions with his information of the Affections of the We&s;t, &startq;&endq;where the King's Re|&s;toration was, he &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;&s;o impatiently longed for, that they had made choice of few or no Members to &s;erve for <HI>Cornwal,</HI> or <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> but &s;uch, who, they were confident, would contribute all they could to invite the King to return. And when that Subject was once upon the Stage, They who concurr'd with mo&s;t frankne&s;s, would find mo&s;t credit; and They who oppo&s;ed it, would be overborne with la&s;ting&endq; reproach.</Q> When the General had reflected upon the whole matter, <MILESTONE N="50"> he re&s;olved to advance that de&s;ign; and &s;o con&s;ulted with his friend, how he might manage it in that manner, before the Parliament &s;hould

a&s;&s;emble, that what followed might be imputed to His coun&s;els, and contrivance.</P>
<P>THERE was then in the Town a Gentleman well known to be a Servant of eminent tru&s;t to the King, S^r <HI>John Greenvil,</HI> who, from the time of the &s;urrender of <HI>Silly,</HI> had enjoy'd his e&s;tate, and &s;ometimes his liberty, though, under the jealou&s;y of a di&s;affected Per&s;on, often re&s;train'd. He had been privy to the &s;ending to the General into <HI>Scot|land</HI> the Clergy-man, his Brother; and was conver&s;ant with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty, and at this time were taken notice of to have all intimacy with M^r <HI>Mordaunt;</HI> who mo&s;t imme|diately <MILESTONE N="10"> corre&s;ponded with <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> This Gentleman was of a family to which the General was allied; and he had been obliged to his Fa|ther, S^r <HI>Bevil Greenvil;</HI> who lo&s;t his life at the Battle of <HI>Lan&s;down</HI> for the King, and by his Will had recommended his much impair'd for|tune, and his Wife and Children, to the care and coun&s;el of his Neigh|bour and Friend, M^r <HI>Morrice;</HI> who had executed the Tru&s;t with the utmo&s;t fidelity and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE General was content, that S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> &s;hould be tru&s;ted in this great Affair, and that M^r <HI>Morrice</HI> &s;hould bring him &s;ecretly to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sr</HI> John Greenvil <HI>in|troduced to the General by Mr</HI> Morrice.</NOTE> him in a private Lodging he had in S^r <HI>James</HI>'s. When he came to him <MILESTONE N="20"> after he had &s;olemnly conjured him to &s;ecrecy, upon the peril of his Life; <Q>he told him, &startq;he meant to &s;end him to the King; with whom, he pre&s;umed, he had credit enough to be believed without any te&s;ti|mony; for he was re&s;olved not to write to the King, nor to give him any thing in writing; but wi&s;hed him to confer with M^r <HI>Morrice,</HI> and to take &s;hort Memorials in his own hand of tho&s;e particulars he &s;hould offer to him in di&s;cour&s;e; which when he had done, he&endq; would him&s;elf confer with him again at an hour he &s;hould appoint.</Q> And &s;o he retired ha&s;tily out of the Room, as if he were jealous that other Men would wonder at his ab&s;ence. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P><Q>THAT which M^r <HI>Morrice</HI> communicated to <HI>Greenvil,</HI> was, after he had enlarged upon &startq;the perplexity the General was in, by the &s;eve|ral humours and factions which prevailed, and that he dur&s;t not tru&s;t any Officer of his own Army, or any Friend but him&s;elf, with his&endq; own &s;ecret purpo&s;es;</Q> <Q>he advi&s;ed, &startq;that the King &s;hould write a Let|ter to the General; in which, after kind and gracious Expre&s;&s;ions, he &s;hould de&s;ire him to deliver the inclo&s;ed Letter, and Declaration&endq; to the Parliament;</Q> the particular heads, and materials for which Let|ter, and Declaration, <HI>Morrice</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed to him; the end of which was to &s;atisfy all Intere&s;ts, and to comply with every Man's humour, and indeed to &s;uffer every Man to enjoy what he would. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>AFTER S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> had enough di&s;cour&s;ed all particulars with him, and taken &s;uch &s;hort Memorials for his Memory as he thought nece&s;&s;ary, within a day or two he was brought with the &s;ame wari|ne&s;s, and in another place, to the General; to whom he read the &s;hort <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Tran&s;|actions be|tween the Ge|neral,</HI> Mor|rice, <HI>and</HI> Greenvil.</NOTE> Notes he had taken; to which little was added: <Q>and the General &s;aid, &startq;that if the King writ to that purpo&s;e, when he brought the Letter to him, he would keep it in his hands, till he found a fit time to deli|ver&endq; it, or &s;hould think of another way to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty.</Q> Only he added another particular, as an advice ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the King to con&s;ent to, which was, his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ent remove out of <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Flanders.</HI> He undertook to know, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had no purpo&s;e to do any thing for him, and that all his friends were jealous, that
<PB N="575" REF="5850">
it would not be in his power to remove from thence, if he deferr'd it till they di&s;cover'd that he was like to have no need of them. <Q>And therefore he de&s;ired, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would make ha&s;t to <HI>Breda,</HI> and that, for the publick &s;atisfaction, and that it might be evident he had left <HI>Flanders,</HI> what&s;oever he &s;hould &s;end in writing &s;hould&endq; bear date as from <HI>Breda;</HI></Q> <Q>and he enjoyn'd S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> &startq;not to return, till he had him&s;elf &s;een the King out of the Dominions of&endq; <HI>Flanders.</HI></Q> Thus in&s;tructed he left him, who taking M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thus in&s;truct|ed, S^r</HI> John Greenvil <HI>goes over to</HI> Bru&s;+&s;els <HI>with M^r</HI> Mordaunt</NOTE> with him for the Companion of his journey, &s;et out for <HI>Flanders</HI> about the beginning of <HI>April</HI> 1660, and in few days arrived &s;afely at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>IT was no unplea&s;ant pro&s;pect to the King, nor of &s;mall advantage to him, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> look'd upon all the&s;e Revolutions in <HI>Eng|land</HI> as the effects of the &s;everal animo&s;ities, and emulations of the different Factions among them&s;elves; a Contention only between the Presbyterian-Republicans on one &s;ide, and the Independent and Le|velling Party on the other, for &s;uperiority, and who &s;hould &s;teer the Government of the State, without the lea&s;t reference to the King's In|tere&s;t: which, they thought, would in no degree be advanced which &s;ide &s;oever prevailed. And therefore <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> by his <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Agents (who made him believe any thing) continued firm to the Levellers; <MILESTONE N="20"> who, if they got the better of their Enemies, he was a&s;&s;ured, would make a good Peace with <HI>Spain;</HI> which above all things they de&s;ired: and if they were oppre&s;&s;ed, he made as little doubt they would unite them&s;elves to the King, upon &s;uch conditions as he &s;hould arbitrate between them. And in this confidence he embraced all the ways he could to corre&s;pond with them, receiving &s;uch Agents with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy who repaired to him to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI> and when In&s;truments of mo&s;t credit and importance, would not adventure thither, he was con|tented to &s;end &s;ome Per&s;on, who was entru&s;ted by him, into <HI>Zeeland</HI> to confer and treat with them. And in this kind of Negotiation, which <MILESTONE N="30"> was very expen&s;ive, they cared not what Money they disbur&s;ed, whil&s;t they neglected the King, and &s;uffer'd him to be without that &s;mall &s;up|ply which they had a&s;&s;ign'd to him.</P>
<P>IN this temper were the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters, when M^r <HI>Mordaunt</HI> and S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> came to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> And <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> had &s;o fully po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> with the &s;ame Spirit, that when the Chan|cellor, in his Letters to S^r <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;ident there, intimated the hopes they had of a Revolution in <HI>England</HI> to the ad|vantage of the King, he an&s;wer'd plainly, <Q>&startq;that he dur&s;t not commu|nicate any of tho&s;e Letters to the Mini&s;ters there; who would laugh <MILESTONE N="40"> at him for abu&s;ing them, &s;ince they look'd upon all tho&s;e hopes of the King as imaginary, and without foundation of Sen&s;e, and upon his&endq; condition as mo&s;t deplorable and ab&s;olutely de&s;perate.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> had at large inform'd his Maje&s;ty of the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> of the manner of the General's conference with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> John Greenvil <HI>gives the King an Ac|count of his Negotiation with the Ge+neral.</HI></NOTE> him, and the good affection of M^r <HI>Morrice,</HI> and had communicated the In&s;tructions and Advices he had receiv'd, as his Maje&s;ty was very glad that the General had thus far di&s;cover'd him&s;elf, and that he had open'd a door for corre&s;pondence, &s;o he was not without great per|plexity upon many particulars which were recommended to be done; <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;ome of which he believ'd impo&s;&s;ible and unpracticable, as the leaving <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Deliberations upon the terms propo&s;ed by the General</NOTE> every body in the &s;tate they were in, and confirming their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in all the Lands which they held in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> by
<PB N="576" REF="5860">
purcha&s;e or donation, whether of Lands belonging to the Crown and Church, or &s;uch who for adhering to his Father and him&s;elf, were de|clared Delinquents, and had their Lands confi&s;cated and di&s;po&s;ed of as their Enemies had thought fit. Then, the complying with all hu|mours in Religion, and the granting a general liberty of Con&s;cience, was a violation of all the Laws in force, and could not be apprehended to con&s;i&s;t with the Peace of the Kingdom. No Man was more di&s;|po&s;ed to a general Act of Indemnity and Oblivion than his Maje&s;ty was; which he knew, in &s;o long and univer&s;al a guilt, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. But he thought it neither con&s;i&s;tent with his Honour, nor his Con&s;cience, that tho&s;e who had &s;ate as Judges, and condemn'd his <MILESTONE N="10"> Father to be murther'd, &s;hould be comprehended in that Act of Par|don: <Q>yet it was advi&s;ed, &startq;that there might be no Exception; or that&endq; above Four might not be excepted;</Q> <Q>becau&s;e, it was alledg'd, &startq;that &s;ome of them had facilitated the General's march by falling from <HI>Lam|bert,</HI> and others had barefaced advanced the King's Service very&endq; much.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER great deliberation upon all the particulars, and weighing the importance of complying with the General's advice in all things which his Con&s;cience and Honour would permit, his Maje&s;ty directed &s;uch Letters and Declarations to be prepared, as &s;hould be, in a good <MILESTONE N="20"> degree, &s;uitable to the Wi&s;hes and Coun&s;el of the General, and yet make the tran&s;action of tho&s;e things which he did not like, the effect of the power of the Parliament, rather than of his Maje&s;ty's approbation. And the confidence he had upon the general Election of hone&s;t and prudent Men, and in &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, who, he heard, were already cho&s;en, di&s;po&s;ed him to make a general reference of all things which he could not re&s;erve to him&s;elf, to the wi&s;dom of the Parliament, upon pre&s;umption that they would not exact more from him than he was willing to con&s;ent to; &s;ince he well knew, that whatever title They a&s;&s;umed, or He gave them, they mu&s;t have another kind of Parliament <MILESTONE N="30"> to confirm all that was done by them; without which They could not be &s;afe, and contented, nor his Maje&s;ty obliged.</P>
<P>THE Advice for his Maje&s;ty's remove out of <HI>Flanders</HI> pre&s;ently, was not ungrateful; for he had rea&s;ons abundant to be weary of it: yet he was without any great inclination to <HI>Holland;</HI> where he had been as unkindly u&s;ed as it was po&s;&s;ible for any Gentleman to be. But be&s;ides the Authority which the General's advice de&s;erv'd to have, the truth is, his Maje&s;ty could remove no whither el&s;e. <HI>France</HI> was equally ex|cepted again&s;t, and equally di&s;agreeable to the King; and the way thi|ther mu&s;t be through all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions: <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was a place <MILESTONE N="40"> in many re&s;pects de&s;irable, becau&s;e it was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> from whence he might embark for <HI>England</HI> upon the &s;horte&s;t warn|ing. And upon the fir&s;t alterations in <HI>England,</HI> after the Peace be|tween the two Crowns, the King had &s;ent to <HI>Lockhart,</HI> the Governour, and General of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, by a Per&s;on of Honour, well known and re&s;pected by him, to invite him to his Service by the pro&s;pect he had of the Revolutions like to en&s;ue (which probably could not but be advantageous to the King) and by the uncertainty of <HI>Lockhart</HI>'s own condition upon any &s;uch Alterations. The Arguments were urged to him with clearne&s;s and &s;orce enough, and all nece&s;&s;ary offers made to <MILESTONE N="50"> per&s;wade him to declare for the King, and to receive his Maje&s;ty into that Garri&s;on; which might be facilitated by his Maje&s;ty's Troops, if
<PB N="577" REF="5870">
he did not think his own Soldiers enough at his devotion: <Q>yet he could not be prevailed with, urging &startq;the Tru&s;t he had receiv'd, and the in|decency&endq; of breaking it;</Q> <Q>though, he confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;there was &s;uch a jea|lou&s;y of him in the Council of State, for his relation and alliance to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that he expected every day to be removed from that Com|mand;&endq; as &s;hortly after he was.</Q> Whether this refu&s;al proceeded from the punctuality of his Nature (for he was a Man of parts, and of ho|nour) or from his Jealou&s;y of the Garri&s;on, that they would not be di&s;|po&s;ed by him (for though he was exceedingly belov'd, and obeyed by them, yet they were all <HI>Engli&s;h-</HI>men, and he had none of his own Na|tion, <MILESTONE N="10"> which was the <HI>Scoti&s;h,</HI> but in his own Family) certain it is, that, at the &s;ame time he refu&s;ed to treat with the King, he refu&s;ed to accept the great offers made to him by the Cardinal; who had a high e&s;teem of him, and offer'd to make him Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> with great ap|pointments of Pen&s;ions and other Emoluments, if he would deliver <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and <HI>Mardike</HI> into the hands of <HI>France;</HI> all which Overtures he rejected: &s;o that his Maje&s;ty had no place to re&s;ort to preferable to <HI>Breda.</HI></P>
<P>THE King was re&s;olv'd rather to make no mention of the Murtherers of his Father, than to pardon any of them, and except four, as was <MILESTONE N="20"> propo&s;ed; but cho&s;e rather to refer the whole con&s;ideration of that Af|fair, without any re&s;triction, to the Con&s;cience of the Parliament; yet with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, and de&s;criptions, that they could not but di&s;cern that he tru&s;ted them in confidence that they would do Them&s;elves and the Nation right, in declaring their dete&s;tation of, and preparing ven|geance for, that Parricide. And from the time that the &s;ecluded Mem|bers &s;ate again with the Rump, there was good evidence given that they would not leave that odious Murther unexamined and unpuni&s;hed; which the more di&s;po&s;ed the King to depend upon their Virtue and Ju&s;tice. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>WHEN the Summons were &s;ent out to call the Parliament, there was no mention or thought of a Hou&s;e of Peers; nor had the General inti|mated any &s;uch thing to S^r <HI>John Greenvil;</HI> nor did S^r <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf, or M^r <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> conceive that any of the Lords had a purpo&s;e to meet at fir&s;t, but that all mu&s;t depend upon the Commons. However, the King thought not fit to pa&s;s Them by, but to have a Letter prepared as well for Them as for the Hou&s;e of Commons; and likewi&s;e another to the Fleet; and another to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <HI>London;</HI> who, by adhering to the General, were like to add very much to his Authority. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>

<P>THE Marquis &s;eem'd to think That of little Moment; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;that <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> expected every day to receive a&s;&s;urance, that the Level|lers would unite them&s;elves to the King's Intere&s;t, upon more mo|derate&endq; Conditions than they had hitherto made;</Q> <Q>but de&s;ired his Ma|je&s;ty, &startq;that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> might ha&s;ten his journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> to&endq; receive the Command that was there re&s;erv'd for him;</Q> <Q>and the King de&s;ired him, &startq;that the Forces he had promi&s;ed for his Service, might be ready again&s;t his return to be embarked upon the fir&s;t appearance of&endq; a hopeful occa&s;ion.</Q> So they parted; and his Maje&s;ty went the next <MILESTONE N="10"> day to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> with that &s;mall retinue he u&s;ed to travel with.</P>
<P>HIS departure was &s;ome hours earlier than the Marquis imagin'd; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Spaniards <HI>de&s;ign to &s;ei&s;e his Maje&s;ty, di&s;cover'd.</HI></NOTE> and the rea&s;on of it was this: In that night, one M^r <HI>William Galloway,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> young Man, Page at that time to <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> came to the Lord Chancellor's lodgings, and finding his Secretary in his own room, told him, <Q>&startq;he mu&s;t needs &s;peak pre&s;ently with his Lord;&endq; for he had &s;omething to impart to him that concern'd the King's life.</Q> The Chancellor, though at that time in bed, order'd him to be ad|mitted; <Q>and the poor Man trembling told him, &startq;that his Lord <HI>Don</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Alonzo</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> had been long together that evening; and, that him&s;elf had overheard them &s;aying &s;omething of &s;ending a Guard to attend the King: that, about an hour after, they parted; and the Marquis &s;ent a paper to <HI>Don Alonzo;</HI> who, when he went to bed, laid it on his table: that him&s;elf, who lay in his Ma&s;ter's Ante-Chamber, look'd into the paper, when his Ma&s;ter was&endq; in bed;</Q> and, &s;eeing what it was, had brought it to the Chancellor: It imported an Order to an Officer to attend the King with a Party of Hor&s;e, for a Guard wherever he went (a re&s;pect that never had been paid him before) but not to &s;uffer him, on any terms, to go out of the Town. A&s;&s;oon as the Chancellor had read the Order, he &s;ent his Se|cretary <MILESTONE N="30"> with it to the King; who was in bed likewi&s;e; and his Maje&s;ty having read it, the Secretary return'd it to <HI>Galloway;</HI> who went home, and laid it in its place upon his Ma&s;ter's table.

<P><Q>&startq;YOU have been your &s;elves Witne&s;&s;es of &s;o many Revolutions, and <MILESTONE N="10"> have had &s;o much experience, how far any power and authority that is only a&s;&s;umed by pa&s;&s;ion and appetite, and not &s;upported by Ju&s;tice, is from providing for the Happine&s;s and Peace of the People, or from receiving any obedience from them (without which no Government can provide for them) that you may very rea&s;onably believe, that God hath not been &s;o well plea&s;ed with the Attempts that have been made, &s;ince he hath u&s;ually encrea&s;ed the confu&s;ion, by giving all the &s;ucce&s;s that hath been de&s;ired, and brought that to pa&s;s without effect, which the De&s;igners have propo&s;ed as the be&s;t means to &s;ettle and compo&s;e the Nation: and therefore We cannot but hope and believe, <MILESTONE N="20"> that you will concur with Us in the Remedy We have applied; which, to human under&s;tanding, is only proper for the ills We all groan un|der; and that you will make your &s;elves the ble&s;&s;ed In&s;truments to bring this ble&s;&s;ing of Peace and Reconciliation upon King and People; it being the u&s;ual method in which Divine Providence delighteth it &s;elf, to u&s;e and &s;anctify tho&s;e very means, which ill Men de&s;ign for the &s;atisfaction of private and particular ends and ambition, and other wicked purpo&s;es, to whole&s;ome and publick ends, and to e&s;tabli&s;h that good which is mo&s;t contrary to the De&s;igners; which is the greate&s;t manife&s;tation of God's peculiar kindne&s;s to a Nation that can <MILESTONE N="30"> be given in this world.

<OPENER><SIGNED>Charles R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;TRUSTY and Well-beloved, We greet you well: In the&s;e great and in&s;upportable afflictions and calamities, under which the poor Nation <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letter to the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> hath been &s;o long exerci&s;ed, and by which it is &s;o near exhau&s;ted, We cannot think of a more natural and proper Remedy, than to re|&s;ort to tho&s;e for coun&s;el and advice, who have &s;een and ob&s;erv'd the fir&s;t beginning of Our Mi&s;eries, the progre&s;s from bad to wor&s;e, and <MILESTONE N="50"> the mi&s;takes and mi&s;under&s;tandings, which have been produced, and
<PB N="581" REF="5910">
contributed to inconveniences which were not intended; and after &s;o many Revolutions, and the ob&s;ervation of what hath attended them, are now tru&s;ted by our good Subjects to repair the Breaches which are made, and to provide proper Remedies for tho&s;e Evils, and for the&endq; la&s;ting Peace, Happine&s;s, and Security of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;WE do a&s;&s;ure You upon Our Royal word, that none of Our Pre|dece&s;&s;ors have had a greater e&s;teem of Parliaments, than We have in our judgement, as well as from Our obligation; We do be|lieve them to be &s;o vital a part of the Con&s;titution of the Kingdom, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Government of it, that We well know nei|ther <MILESTONE N="10"> Prince nor People can be in any tolerable degree happy without them; and therefore you may be confident, that We &s;hall allways look upon Their Coun&s;els, as the be&s;t We can receive; and &s;hall be as tender of their Privileges, and as careful to pre&s;erve and protect them, as of that which is mo&s;t near to Our Self, and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for Our&endq; own pre&s;ervation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;AND as this is Our opinion of Parliaments, that their Authority is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the Government of the Kingdom; &s;o We are mo&s;t confident, that you believe, and find, that the pre&s;ervation of the King's Authority is as nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of Parliaments; <MILESTONE N="20"> and that it is not the Name, but the right Con&s;titution of them, which can prepare and apply proper Remedies for tho&s;e Evils which are grievous to the People, and which can thereby e&s;tabli&s;h their Peace and Security. And therefore We have not the lea&s;t doubt, but that you will be as tender in, and as jealous of, any thing that may infringe Our Honour, or impair Our Authority, as of your own Liberty and Property; which is be&s;t pre&s;erv'd by pre&s;erving the&endq; other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;HOW far We have tru&s;ted you in this great Affair, and how much it is in your power to re&s;tore the Nation to all that it hath lo&s;t, and <MILESTONE N="30"> to redeem it from any infamy it hath undergone, and to make the King and People as happy as they ought to be; you will find by Our inclo&s;ed Declaration; a Copy of which We have likewi&s;e &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Peers: and you will ea&s;ily believe, that We would not vo|luntarily, and of Our &s;elf, have repo&s;ed &s;o great a Tru&s;t in you, but upon an entire confidence that you will not abu&s;e it, and that you will proceed in &s;uch a manner, and with &s;uch due con&s;ideration of Us who have tru&s;ted you, that We &s;hall not be a&s;hamed of declining other A&s;&s;i&s;tance (which We have a&s;&s;urance of) and repairing to You for more natural and proper Remedies for the Evils We would be <MILESTONE N="40"> freed from; nor &s;orry, that We have bound up Our own Intere&s;ts &s;o entirely with that of Our Subjects, as that We refer it to the &s;ame Per&s;ons to take care of Us, who are tru&s;ted to provide for Them. We look upon you as wi&s;e and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Men, and good Patriots, who will rai&s;e up tho&s;e Banks and Fences which have been ca&s;t down, and who will mo&s;t rea&s;onably hope, that the &s;ame pro&s;perity will again &s;pring from tho&s;e Roots, from which it hath heretofore and allways grown; nor can We apprehend that you will propo&s;e any thing to Us, or expect any thing from Us, but that We are as ready to give, as&endq; You to receive.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P><Q>&startq;IF You de&s;ire the Advancement and Propagation of the Prote&s;tant Religion, We have, by our con&s;tant profe&s;&s;ion, and practice of it,

given &s;ufficient te&s;timony to the world, that neither the unkindne&s;s of tho&s;e of the &s;ame Faith towards Us, nor the civilities and obligations from tho&s;e of a contrary profe&s;&s;ion (of both which We have had an abundant Evidence) could in the lea&s;t degree &s;tartle Us, or make Us &s;werve from it; and nothing can be propo&s;ed to manife&s;t Our Zeal and Affection for it, to which We will not readily con&s;ent. And We hope, in due time, Our &s;elf to propo&s;e &s;omewhat to you for the pro|pagation of it, that will &s;atisfy the world, that We have allways made it both Our Care and Our Study, and have enough ob&s;erv'd what is&endq; mo&s;t like to bring di&s;advantage to it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;IF You de&s;ire &s;ecurity for tho&s;e who, in the&s;e calamitous times, ei|ther <MILESTONE N="10"> wilfully or weakly have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e bounds which were pre&s;cribed, and have invaded each others Rights, We have left to you to provide for their Security and Indemnity, and in &s;uch a way, as you &s;hall think ju&s;t and rea&s;onable; and by a ju&s;t computation of what Men have done, and &s;uffer'd, as near as is po&s;&s;ible, to take care that all Men be &s;atisfied; which is the &s;ure&s;t way to &s;uppre&s;s, and ex|tirpate all &s;uch uncharitablene&s;s and animo&s;ity, as might hereafter &s;hake and threaten that Peace, which for the pre&s;ent might &s;eem e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. If there be a crying Sin, for which the Nation may be in|volved <MILESTONE N="20"> in the infamy that attends it, We cannot doubt but that you will be as &s;ollicitous to redeem it, and vindicate the Nation from that&endq; guilt and infamy, as We can be.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;IF You de&s;ire that reverence and obedience may be paid to the fun|damental Laws of the Land, and that Ju&s;tice may be equally and im|partially admini&s;ter'd to all Men, it is that which We de&s;ire to be &s;worn to Our &s;elf, and that all Per&s;ons in power and authority &s;hould&endq; be &s;o too.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;IN a word, there is nothing that you can propo&s;e that may make the Kingdom happy, which We will not contend with you to com|pa&s;s; and upon this confidence and A&s;&s;urance, We have thought fit <MILESTONE N="30"> to &s;end you this Declaration, that you may, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, at this di&s;tance, &s;ee our Heart; which, when God &s;hall bring Us nearer together (as We hope he will do &s;hortly) will appear to you very agreeable to what We have profe&s;&s;ed; and We hope, that We have made that right Chri&s;tian u&s;e of Our Affliction, and that the ob|&s;ervation and experience We have had in other Countries, have been &s;uch, as that We, and, We hope, all Our Subjects, &s;hall be the better&endq; for what We have &s;een and &s;uffer'd.</Q></P>

THE two Gentlemen lately mention'd to have been with the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> John Creenvil <HI>ar$ rives in</HI> Eng|land, <HI>and com|municates the Letters to the General. The General$&punc; behaviour af+ter that time</HI></NOTE> return'd to <HI>London</HI> before the defeat of <HI>Lambert,</HI> and a full week be|fore the Parliament was to begin. The General, upon the peru&s;al of the Copies of the &s;everal di&s;patches, liked all very well. And it ought to be remember'd for his honour, that from this time he behaved him&s;elf with great affection towards the King; and though he was offer'd all the Au|thority that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had enjoyed, and the Title of King, he u&s;ed all his endeavours to promote and advance the Intere&s;t of his Maje&s;ty: yet he as carefully retained the Secret, and did not communicate to any Per&s;on living (M^r <HI>Morrice</HI> only excepted) that he had receiv'd any Letter <MILESTONE N="10"> from the King, till the very minute that he pre&s;ented it to the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd at the &s;ame time a concurrence, which much faci|litated <NOTE PLACE="marg">$Span$ of the King's Party at this time; $hich had great $Word$</NOTE> the great work in hand. For &s;ince a great ob&s;truction that hin|der'd the Univer&s;al con&s;ent to call in the King, was the Con&s;cience of the per&s;onal injuries, incivilities, reproachful, and barbarous u&s;age, which all the Royal Party had &s;u&s;tain'd, and the Apprehen&s;ion that their Animo&s;ities were &s;o great, that, notwith&s;tanding all Acts of Pardon and Indemnity granted by the King, all opportunities would be embraced for &s;ecret revenge, and that They who had been kept under, and op|pre&s;&s;ed <MILESTONE N="20"> for near twenty years, would for the future u&s;e the power they could not be without upon the King's Re&s;toration, with extreme Li|cence and In&s;olence; to obviate this too rea&s;onable imagination, &s;ome di&s;creet Per&s;ons of the King's Party cau&s;ed a Declaration to be prepared; <Q>in which (after their acknowledgements and thanks to the General, &startq;for having, next under the Divine Providence, &s;o far conducted the&s;e Na|tions towards a happy recovery of their Laws, and Ancient Govern|ment)&endq; they &s;incerely profe&s;&s;ed,</Q> <Q>&startq;that they reflected on their pa&s;t Suf|ferings as from the hand of God; and therefore did not cheri&s;h any vio|lent thoughts or inclinations again&s;t any Per&s;ons what&s;oever, who had been any way in&s;trumental in them; and that, if the indi&s;cretion of <MILESTONE N="30"> any particular Per&s;ons &s;hould tran&s;port them to Expre&s;&s;ions contrary&endq; to this their general Sen&s;e, they utterly di&s;claimed them.</Q> <Q>They far|ther promi&s;ed, &startq;by their quiet and peaceable behaviour, to te&s;tify their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Council of State, in expectation of the future Parlia|ment; on who&s;e wi&s;dom, they tru&s;ted, God would give &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing,&endq; as might produce a perfect Settlement both in Church and State.</Q> <Q>And la&s;tly they declared, &startq;that, as the General had not cho&s;en the &s;andy foundations of &s;elf-Government, but the firm Rock of National In|tere&s;t, whereon to frame a &s;ettlement, &s;o it was their hope and prayer, that, when the building &s;hould come to be rai&s;ed, it might not, like <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Rome,</HI> have the beginning in the blood of Brethren; nor, like <HI>Babel,</HI> be interrupted by confu&s;ion of Tongues; but that all might &s;peak one Language, and be of one Name; that all mention of parties and fa|ctions, and all rancor and animo&s;ities may be thrown in, and buried,&endq; like Rubbi&s;h under the Foundation.</Q></P>

Such a proportion of Land was allotted to every Man as the Protector thought competent for them; upon which they were to give formal relea&s;es of all their pretences and titles to any Lands in any other Provinces, of which they had been deprived; and if they refu&s;ed to give &s;uch Relea&s;es, they were &s;till deprived of what they would not relea&s;e, without any rea&s;onable hope of ever being re&s;tored to it; and left to &s;tarve within the Limits pre&s;cribed to them; out of which they dur&s;t not withdraw; and They who did adventure, were without all remor&s;e pro&s;ecuted by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as they were di&s;cover'd: &s;o that very few refu&s;ed to &s;ign tho&s;e Relea&s;es, or other Acts which were <MILESTONE N="30"> demanded; upon which the Lords and Gentlemen, had &s;uch A&s;&s;ign|ments of Land made to them, as in &s;ome degree were proportionable to their Qualities; which fell out le&s;s mi&s;chievou&s;ly to tho&s;e who were of that Province, who came to enjoy &s;ome part of what had been their own; but to tho&s;e who were driven thither out of other Provinces, it was little le&s;s de&s;tructive than if they had nothing; it was &s;o long be|fore they could &s;ettle them&s;elves, and by husbandry rai&s;e any thing out of their Lands to &s;upport their Lives: yet nece&s;&s;ity obliged them to acquie&s;cence, and to be in &s;ome &s;ort indu&s;trious; &s;o that at the time to which we are now arriv'd, they were &s;ettled, within the Limits pre|&s;cribed, <MILESTONE N="40"> in a condition of living; though even the hard Articles which had been granted, were not punctually ob&s;erv'd to them; but their pro|portions re&s;train'd, and le&s;&s;en'd by &s;ome pretences of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under &s;ome former Grants, or other Titles; to all which they found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit, and were compell'd to enjoy what was left, under all the marks and brands which ever accompanied a conquer'd Nation; which reproach the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had taken &s;o heavily from the Earl of <HI>Straf|ford,</HI> when they were equally free with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who had &s;ub|dued them, that they made it part of that Charge upon which he lo&s;t his Life. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>

<P>SIR <HI>Charles Coot,</HI> who was Pre&s;ident of <HI>Conaught,</HI> and had a good Command, and Intere&s;t in the Army, was a Man of le&s;s guilt, and more courage, and impatience to &s;erve the King.

<P>SIR <HI>Arthur Forbes</HI> arrived at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> before the King had any a&s;|&s;urance or confident hope of the General, and when few Men thought his Fortune better than de&s;perate: &s;o that, if what S^r <HI>Arthur</HI> propo&s;ed (which was kept very &s;ecret) had been publi&s;h'd, mo&s;t Men about the Court would have been very &s;ollicitous for his Maje&s;ty's going into <HI>Ire|land.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> But his Maje&s;ty well knew that that unhappy Kingdom mu&s;t in|fallibly wait upon the fate of <HI>England;</HI> and therefore he re&s;olv'd to at|tend the vici&s;&s;itudes there; which, in his own thoughts, he &s;till be|liev'd would produce &s;omewhat, in the end, of which he &s;hould have the benefit; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed S^r <HI>Arthur Forbes</HI> with &s;uch Letters and Commi&s;&s;ions as he de&s;ired; who thereupon return'd for <HI>Ireland;</HI> where he found the State of Affairs very much alter'd &s;ince his departure.

Commons was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, would not lo&s;e their &s;hare of thanks, but made ha&s;t into their Hou&s;e without excluding any who had been &s;e|que&s;ter'd from &s;itting there for their Delinquency; and then they re|ceiv'd likewi&s;e the Letter from S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> which his Maje&s;ty <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>S^r John Green|vil <HI>delivers the Letter to the Hou&s;e of Lords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lord Mayor &amp;c re|ceive their Letter with the &s;ame duty So does the Army and Fleet.</HI></P></NOTE> had directed to them; and they receiv'd it with the &s;ame duty and acknowledgement. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Coun|cil, were likewi&s;e tran&s;ported with the King's goodne&s;s towards them, and with the Expre&s;&s;ions of his Royal Clemency; and enter'd into clo&s;e Deliberation, what return they &s;hould make to him to manife&s;t their duty and gratitude. And the Officers of the Army, and Fleet, <MILESTONE N="10"> upon the &s;ight of the Letters to their Generals, and his Maje&s;ty's De|claration, thought them&s;elves highly honour'd, in that they were looked upon as good In&s;truments of his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;toration; and made tho&s;e Vows, and publi&s;hed &s;uch Declarations of their Loyalty and Duty, as their Generals cau&s;ed to be provided for them; which they &s;igned with the loude&s;t alacrity. And the truth is, the Gene|ral managed the bu&s;ine&s;s, which he now own'd him&s;elf to have un|dertaken, with wonderful prudence and dexterity. And as the na|ture and humour of his Officers was well known to him, &s;o he re|moved &s;uch from their Commands who&s;e Affections he &s;u&s;pected, <MILESTONE N="20"> and conferr'd their places upon others, of whom he was mo&s;t a&s;|&s;ured. In a word, there was either real joy in the hearts of all Men, or at lea&s;t their Countenance appear'd &s;uch as if they were glad at the heart.</P>
<P>THE Committee who were appointed by the Hou&s;e of Commons to prepare an An&s;wer to the King's Letter, found it hard to &s;atisfy all Men, who were well contented that the King &s;hould be invited to re|turn: but &s;ome thought, that the guilt of the Nation did require le&s;s precipitation than was like to be u&s;ed; and that the Treaty ought fir&s;t to be made with the King, and conditions of Security agreed on, be|fore <MILESTONE N="30"> his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be receiv'd. Many of tho&s;e, who had con|ferr'd together before the meeting of the Parliament, had de&s;ign'd &s;ome Articles to be prepared, according to the Model of tho&s;e at <HI>Kil|lingworth,</HI> in the time of King <HI>Harry</HI> the third, to which the King &s;hould be &s;worn before he came home. Then the Presbyterian Party, of which there were many Members in Parliament, though they were rather trouble&s;ome than powerful, &s;eem'd very &s;ollicitous that &s;ome|what &s;hould be concluded in veneration of the Covenant; and, at lea&s;t, that &s;omewhat &s;hould be in&s;erted in their An&s;wer to the di&s;coun|tenance of the Bi&s;hops. But the warmer Zeal of the Hou&s;e threw <MILESTONE N="40"> away all tho&s;e formalities and affectations: <Q>They &s;aid, &startq;they had pro|ceeded too far already in their Vote upon the receipt of the Letter, to fall back again, and to offend the King with colder Expre&s;&s;ions&endq; of their duty.</Q> In the end, after &s;ome days debate, finding an equal impatience without the Walls to that within the Hou&s;e, they were contented to gratify the Presbyterians in the length of the An&s;wer. and in u&s;ing &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which would plea&s;e Them, and could do the King no prejudice; and all agreed, that This An&s;wer &s;hould be return'd to his Maje&s;ty, which is here in&s;erted in the very words. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>

For which <MILESTONE N="10"> We do, in the fir&s;t place, look up to the great King of Kings, and ble&s;s his name, who hath put the&s;e thoughts into the heart of Our King, to make him glorious in the Eyes of his People; as tho&s;e great Deliverances, which that Divine Maje&s;ty hath afforded unto your Royal Per&s;on, from many dangers, and the &s;upport which he hath given to your Heroick and Princely mind under various tryals, make it appear to all the world that you are precious in His &s;ight. And give us leave to &s;ay, that as your Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to declare your confidence in Parliaments, your E&s;teem of them, and this your judgement, and Character of them, that they are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the <MILESTONE N="20"> Government of the Kingdom, that neither Prince nor People can be in any tolerable degree happy without them, and therefore &s;ay, that you will hearken unto their Coun&s;els, be tender of their Privi|leges, and careful to pre&s;erve, and protect them; &s;o We tru&s;t, and will, with all humility, be bold to affirm, that your Maje&s;ty will not be deceiv'd in Us, and that We will never depart from that fidelity which We owe unto your Maje&s;ty, that Zeal which We bear unto your Service, and a con&s;tant endeavour to advance your Honour and&endq; Greatne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;AND We be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty, We may add this farther for the <MILESTONE N="30"> vindication of Parliaments, and even of the la&s;t Parliament, conven'd under your Royal Father of happy Memory, when, as your Maje&s;ty well ob&s;erves, through mi&s;takes, and mi&s;under&s;tandings, many incon|veniences were produced, which were not intended, that tho&s;e very inconveniences could not have been brought upon Us by tho&s;e Per|&s;ons who had de&s;ign'd them, without violating the Parliament it &s;elf. For they well knew it was not po&s;&s;ible to do a violence to that &s;acred Per&s;on, whil&s;t the Parliament, which had vowed and cove|nanted for the defence and &s;afety of that Per&s;on, remain'd entire. Surely, Sir, as the Per&s;ons of Our Kings have ever been dear unto <MILESTONE N="40"> Parliaments, &s;o We cannot think of that horrid Act committed again&s;t the precious life of Our late Soveraign, but with &s;uch a de|te&s;tation, and abhorrency, as We want words to expre&s;s it; and, next to wi&s;hing it had never been, We wi&s;h it may never be remember'd by your Maje&s;ty, to be unto you an occa&s;ion of &s;orrow, as it will never be remember'd by Us, but with that grief and trouble of mind which it de&s;erves; being the greate&s;t reproach that ever was incurr'd by any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, an Offence to all the Prote&s;tant Churches abroad, and a &s;candal to the profe&s;&s;ion of the truth of Religion here at home; though both Profe&s;&s;ion, and true Profe&s;&s;ors, and the Na|tion <MILESTONE N="50"> it &s;elf, as well as the Parliament, were mo&s;t innocent of it; it having been only the Contrivance and Act of &s;ome few ambitious

and bloody Per&s;ons, and &s;uch others, as by Their influence were mi&s;led. And as We hope and pray, that God will not impute the guilt of it, nor of all the evil Con&s;equences thereof, unto the Land, who&s;e Divine Ju&s;tice never involves the guiltle&s;s with the guilty, &s;o We cannot but give due prai&s;e to your Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s, who are plea&s;ed to entertain &s;uch reconciled, and reconciling thoughts, and with them not only meet, but as it were prevent your Parliament and People, propo&s;ing your &s;elf in a great mea&s;ure, and inviting the Parliament to con&s;ider farther, and advi&s;e your Maje&s;ty, what may be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore the Nation to what it hath lo&s;t, rai&s;e up again <MILESTONE N="10"> the Banks and Fences of it, and make the Kingdom happy by the advancement of Religion, the Security of Our Laws, Liberties, and E&s;tates, and the removing all Jealou&s;ies and Animo&s;ities, which may render our Peace le&s;s certain and durable. Wherein your Maje&s;ty gives a large Evidence of your great Wi&s;dom; judging aright, that, after &s;o high a di&s;temper, and &s;uch an univer&s;al &s;haking of the very foundations, great care mu&s;t be had to repair the breaches, and much circum&s;pection and indu&s;try u&s;ed to provide things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;trengthning of tho&s;e repairs, and preventing what&s;oever may di&s;turb&endq; or weaken them.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"></P>

And We cannot doubt of your Maje&s;ty's effectual performance, &s;ince your own Princely judgement hath prompted unto you the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of doing &s;uch things; and your piety and goodne&s;s hath car|ried you to a free tender of them to your faithful Parliament.

<P><Q>&startq;AND We have yet more Cau&s;e to enlarge our Prai&s;e, and our Prayers to God for your Maje&s;ty, that You have continued un&s;haken in your faith; that neither the temptation of allurements, per&s;wa|&s;ions, and promi&s;es from &s;educing Papi&s;ts on the one hand, nor the <MILESTONE N="40"> per&s;ecution, and hard u&s;age from &s;ome &s;educed, and mi&s;guided Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Prote&s;tant Religion on the other hand, could at all pre|vail on your Maje&s;ty, to make You for&s;ake the Rock of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the God of your Fathers, and the true Prote&s;tant Religion, in which your Maje&s;ty hath been bred; but you have &s;till been as a Rock your &s;elf, firm to your Covenant with Your and Our God, even now expre&s;&s;ing your Zeal and Affection for the Prote&s;tant Religion, and your care and &s;tudy for the propagation thereof.

</LETTER>
<P>ASSOON as this Letter was engro&s;&s;ed and &s;igned, S^r <HI>John Greenvil</HI> was appointed to attend again; <Q>and he being brought to the Bar, the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This An&s;wer is deliver'd to S^r</HI> John Green|vil.</NOTE> Speaker &s;tood up, and told him, &startq;that They need not acquaint him with what grateful hearts they had receiv'd his Maje&s;ty's gracious Letter; he <MILESTONE N="10"> him&s;elf was an ear and eye-witne&s;s of it: their Bells and their Bone|fires had already begun the Proclamation of his Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s, and of Their joys; that they had now prepared an An&s;wer to his Ma|je&s;ty, which &s;hould be deliver'd to him; and that they did not think fit he &s;hould return to their Royal Soveraign without &s;ome te&s;timony of their re&s;pects to him&s;elf; and therefore that they had order'd five hundred pounds to be deliver'd to him, to buy a Jewel to wear, as an honour for being the Me&s;&s;enger of &s;o gracious a Me&s;&s;age; and in&endq; the Name of the Hou&s;e he gave him their mo&s;t hearty thanks.</Q> So <MILESTONE N="20"> great and &s;uddain a Change was this, that a Servant of the King's, who, for near ten years together, had been in Pri&s;ons, and under con|finements, only for being the King's Servant, and would, but three Months before, have been put to have undergone a &s;hameful death, if he had been known to have &s;een the King, &s;hould be now rewarded for bringing a Me&s;&s;age from him. From this time there was &s;uch an Emulation and Impatience in Lords, and Commons, and City, and generally over the Kingdom, who &s;hould make the mo&s;t lively Expre&s;|&s;ions of their Duty and of their Joy, that a Man could not but won|der where tho&s;e People dwelt who had done all the mi&s;chief, and kept <MILESTONE N="30"> the King &s;o many years from enjoying the comfort and &s;upport of &s;uch excellent Subjects.</P>
<P>THE Lords and the Commons now conferr'd together, how they might with more Lu&s;tre perform tho&s;e re&s;pects that might be prepa|ratory to his Maje&s;ty's Return. They remember'd, that, upon the Murther of the late King, there was a Declaration, that no Man, upon peril of his life, and forfeiture of his E&s;tate, &s;hould pre&s;ume to pro|claim his Succe&s;&s;or; which &s;o terrified the People, that they &s;carce dared &s;o much as to pray for him. Wherefore, though this Parliament had now, by all the ways they could think of, publi&s;hed their return <MILESTONE N="40"> to their obedience, yet they thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for the better infor|mation and conviction of the People, to make &s;ome &s;olemn Proclama|tion of his Maje&s;ty's undoubted Right to the Crown, and to oblige all Men to pay that reverence, and duty to him, which they ought to do by the Laws of God and of the Land. Whereupon they gave order to prepare &s;uch a Proclamation; which being done, the Lords and Commons, the General having concerted all things with the City, met in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-</HI>Hall upon the 8^t^h of <HI>May,</HI> within &s;even days after the receipt of the King's Letter; and walked into the <HI>Palace-</HI>yard; where they all &s;tood bare, whil&s;t the Heraulds proclaim'd the King. Then <MILESTONE N="50"> they went to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and did the &s;ame; and afterwards at <HI>Tem|ple-Bar;</HI> where the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen, and all the Com|panies
<PB N="595" REF="6070">
of the City receiv'd them, when the like Proclamation was made in like manner there; and then in the u&s;ual places of the City; which done, the remainder of the day, and the night, was &s;pent in tho&s;e Acclamations, Fe&s;tivals, Bells and Bonefires, as are the natural Attendants upon &s;uch Solemnities. And then nothing was thought of, but to make &s;uch preparations as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty's invitation and Reception. The Proclamation made was in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;ALTHOUGH it can no way be doubted, but that his Maje&s;ty's <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pro|claim'd</HI> May$$</NOTE> Right, and Title to his Crown and Kingdoms, is, and was every way compleated by the death of his mo&s;t Royal Father of glorious <MILESTONE N="10"> Memory, without the ceremony or &s;olemnity of a Proclamation; yet, &s;ince Proclamations in &s;uch Ca&s;es have been allways u&s;ed, to the end that all good Subjects might, upon this occa&s;ion, te&s;tify their duty and re&s;pect, and &s;ince the armed violence, and other the Calamities of many years la&s;t pa&s;t, have hitherto deprived Us of any &s;uch oppor|tunity, whereby We might expre&s;s Our Loyalty and Allegiance to his Maje&s;ty, We therefore, the Lords and Commons now a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, together with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and other Freemen of this Kingdom now pre|&s;ent, do, according to our Duty and Allegiance, heartily, joyfully, <MILESTONE N="20"> and unanimou&s;ly acknowledge and proclaim, that immediately upon the decea&s;e of Our late Soveraign Lord King <HI>Charles,</HI> the imperial Crown of the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and of all the Kingdoms, Domi|nions, and Rights belonging to the &s;ame, did, by inherent Birth-right and lawful undoubted Succe&s;&s;ion, de&s;cend and come to his mo&s;t ex|cellent Maje&s;ty <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, as being lineally, ju&s;tly, and law|fully next Heir of the blood Royal of this Realm; and that, by the Goodne&s;s and Providence of Almighty God, He is of <HI>England, Scot|land, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the mo&s;t potent, mighty, and undoubted King; and thereunto We mo&s;t humbly and faithfully do &s;ubmit, and&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> oblige our Selves, our Heirs, and Po&s;terity for ever.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the time that the King came to <HI>Breda,</HI> very few days pa&s;&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the King.</NOTE> without &s;ome Expre&s;s from <HI>London,</HI> upon the ob&s;ervations of his Friends, and the Applications made to them by many who had been very active again&s;t the King, and were now as &s;ollicitous his Maje&s;ty &s;hould know, that they wholely dedicated them&s;elves to his Service. Even before the General had declared him&s;elf, or the Parliament was a&s;&s;embled, &s;ome, who had &s;ate Judges upon his Father, &s;ent many Ex|cu&s;es, that they were forced to it, and offer'd to perform &s;ignal Services, <MILESTONE N="40"> if they might obtain their Pardon. But his Maje&s;ty would admit no Addre&s;s from them, nor hearken to any Propo&s;itions made on their behalf.</P>
<P>THERE was one in&s;tance that perplexed him; which was the Ca&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The particular Ca&s;e of</HI> In|goldsby.</NOTE> of Colonel <HI>Ingoldsby;</HI> who was in the Number of the late King's Judges, and who&s;e Name was in the Warrant for his Murther. <Q>He, from the depo&s;al of <HI>Richard,</HI> had declared, that he would &s;erve the King, and told M^r <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> &startq;that he would perform all Services he could, without making any conditions; and would be well content, that his Maje&s;ty, when he came home, &s;hould take his head off, if he thought fit; only he de&s;ired that the King might know the truth of&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> his Ca&s;e; which was this.</Q></P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman of a good Extraction, and near allied to <HI>Crom|well,</HI> who had drawn him into the Army before, or about the time
<PB N="596" REF="6080">
when he came fir&s;t to age, where he grew to be a Colonel of Hor&s;e, and to have the reputation of great Courage again&s;t the Enemy, and of equal civility to all Men. It is very true, he was named among&s;t tho&s;e who were appointed to be Judges of the King; and it is as true, that he was never once pre&s;ent with them, allways abhorring the Action in his heart, and having no other Pa&s;&s;ion in any part of the Quarrel, but his per&s;onal kindne&s;s to <HI>Cromwell.</HI> The next day after the horrid Sentence was pronounced, he had an occa&s;ion to &s;peak with an Officer, who, he was told, was in the painted Chamber; where, when he came thither, he &s;aw <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the re&s;t of tho&s;e who <MILESTONE N="10"> had &s;ate upon the King, and were then, as he found afterwards, a&s;|&s;embled to &s;ign the Warrant for the King's death. A&s;&s;oon as <HI>Crom|well</HI>'s Eyes were upon him, he run to him, and taking him by the hand, drew him by force to the Table; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;though he had e&s;caped him all the while before, he &s;hould now &s;ign that Paper as&endq; well as They;</Q> <Q>which he, &s;eeing what it was, refu&s;ed with great pa&s;|&s;ion; &s;aying, &startq;&endq;he knew nothing of the bu&s;ine&s;s;</Q> and offer'd to go away. But <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and others, held him by violence; and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> with a loud laughter, taking his hand in his, and putting the Pen between his Fingers, with his own hand writ <HI>Richard Ingoldsby,</HI> he making <MILESTONE N="20"> all the re&s;i&s;tance he could: <Q>and he &s;aid, &startq;if his Name there were com|pared with what he had ever writ him&s;elf, it could never be look'd&endq; upon as his own hand.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH his Maje&s;ty had within him&s;elf compa&s;&s;ion for him, he would never &s;end him any a&s;&s;urance of his Pardon; pre&s;uming that, if all the&s;e Allegations were true, there would be a Sea&s;on when a di&s;tin|ction would be made, without his Maje&s;ty's declaring him&s;elf between him and tho&s;e other of that bloody Li&s;t, which he re&s;olv'd never to pardon. Nor was <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> at all di&s;hearten'd with this, but pur&s;ued his former Re&s;olutions, and fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> (where <MILESTONE N="30"> there was a great Magazine of Armes and Ammunition) and put out that Governour whom the Rump had put in; and afterwards took <HI>Lambert</HI> Pri&s;oner, as is before remember'd.</P>
<P>WHILST the Fleet was preparing, Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> &s;ent his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountague<HI>'s Me&s;&s;age to the King.</HI></NOTE> Cou&s;in <HI>Edward Mountague</HI> to the King, to let him know that, a&s;&s;oon as it &s;hould be ready (which he hoped might be within &s;o many days) he would be him&s;elf on board, and would then be ready to receive and obey his Maje&s;ty's Orders: this was before the Parliament a&s;&s;embled. He &s;ent word what Officers he was confident of, and of whom he was not a&s;&s;ured, and who he concluded would not concur with him, and <MILESTONE N="40"> who mu&s;t be reduced by force. He de&s;ired to know whether the King had any A&s;&s;urance of the General, who however, he wi&s;h'd, might know nothing of his Re&s;olutions. And it was no &s;mall inconvenience to his Maje&s;ty, that he was re&s;train'd from communicating to either, the confidence he had in the other; which might have facilitated both their de&s;igns. But the mutual jealou&s;ies between them, and indeed of all Men, would not permit that liberty to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE frequent re&s;ort of Per&s;ons to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> before they knew of the King's being gone to <HI>Breda,</HI> and their Communication of the good News they brought to his Maje&s;ty's Servants, and the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who <MILESTONE N="50"> remain'd there, and who publi&s;h'd what they wi&s;h'd as come to pa&s;s, as well as what they heard, made the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters begin to think, that the King's Affairs were not altogether &s;o hopele&s;s as they imagin'd
<PB N="597" REF="6090">
them to be, and that there was more in the King's remove to <HI>Breda</HI> than at fir&s;t appear'd.

THE Earl of S^t <HI>Albans</HI> found the King in too good a po&s;ture of hope and expectation, to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be much importuned upon the In&s;tances he brought; <Q>and was contented to return with the King's acknowledgements and excu&s;e, &startq;that he could not decently pa&s;s through <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's An&s;wer.</NOTE> <HI>Flanders,</HI> after he had refu&s;ed to return to <HI>Bru&s;sels;</HI> and without go|ing through tho&s;e Provinces, he could not well make a journey into&endq; <HI>France.</HI></Q> In the mean time it was no &s;mall plea&s;ure to his Maje&s;ty, to find him&s;elf &s;o &s;olemnly invited, by the Mini&s;ters of the&s;e two great Kings, to enter into their Dominions, out of one which he had been rejected with &s;o many di&s;obligations and indignities; and with &s;o <MILESTONE N="10"> much caution and apprehen&s;ion had been &s;uffer'd to pa&s;s through the other, that he might not re&s;ide a day there, or &s;pend more time than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his journey.</P>
<P>SEVERAL Per&s;ons now came to <HI>Breda,</HI> not, as heretofore to <HI>Co|logne,</HI> and to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> under di&s;gui&s;es, and in fear to be di&s;cover'd, but with bare faces, and the pride and vanity to be taken notice of, to pre|&s;ent their duty to the King; &s;ome being imploy'd to procure Pardons for tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves in danger, and to &s;tand in need of them; others brought good Pre&s;ents in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gold to the King, that their Names, and the Names of their Friends, who &s;ent them, might <MILESTONE N="20"> be remember'd among&s;t the fir&s;t of tho&s;e who made demon&s;trations of their Affections that way to his Maje&s;ty, by &s;upplying his nece&s;&s;ities; which had been di&s;continued for many years to a degree that cannot be believ'd, and ought not to be remember'd.

<P>IN the mean time <HI>Breda</HI> &s;warm'd with <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a multitude repairing thither from all other places, as well as <HI>London,</HI> with Pre&s;ents, and Pro|te&s;tations, <Q>&startq;how much they had longed, and prayed for this ble&s;&s;ed&endq; Change;</Q> and magnifying their Sufferings under the late Tyrannical Go|vernment; when &s;ome of them had been zealous In&s;truments and Pro|moters of it.

So that no Man would have imagin'd by the treatment he now receiv'd, that he had been &s;o lately forbid to come into that place; which indeed had not proceeded <MILESTONE N="50"> from the di&s;affection of the Inhabitants of that good Town, who had allways pa&s;&s;ion for his pro&s;perity, and even then publickly dete&s;ted

<P>THE Entrance into the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the Reception there, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Reception and Entertain|ment there.</NOTE> conducting his Maje&s;ty to the Hou&s;e provided for his Entertainment, was very magnificent, and in all re&s;pects an&s;werable to the Pomp, Wealth, and Greatne&s;s of that State. The Treatment of his Maje&s;ty, and all who had relation to his Service, at the States Charge, during the time of his abode there, which continued many days, was incredi|bly <MILESTONE N="20"> noble and &s;plendid; and the univer&s;al Joy &s;o vi&s;ible, and real, that it could only be exceeded by that of his own Subjects. The States-Ge|neral, in a Body, and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> in a Body apart, perform'd their Compliments with all &s;olemnity; and then &s;everal Per&s;ons, ac|cording to their Faculties, made their profe&s;&s;ions; and a &s;et Number of them was appointed allways to wait in the Court, to receive his Ma|je&s;ty's Commands. All the Emba&s;&s;adours and publick Mini&s;ters of Kings, Princes, and States, repaired to his Maje&s;ty, and profe&s;&s;ed the Joy of their Ma&s;ters on his behalf: &s;o that a Man would have thought this Revolution had been brought to pa&s;s by the general Combination, and <MILESTONE N="30"> Activity of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> that appear'd now to take &s;o much plea&s;ure in it.</P>
<P>THE King had been very few days at the <HI>Hague,</HI> when he heard that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Fleet comes on the Coa&s;t of</HI> Holland.</NOTE> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet was in &s;ight of <HI>Scheveling;</HI> and &s;hortly after, an Of|ficer from Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> was &s;ent to the King, to pre&s;ent his duty to him, and to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> their High Admiral, to receive Or|ders.

<P>THE Duke of <HI>York</HI> went the next day on board the Fleet, to take <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To Duke of</HI> York <HI>at Ad+miral takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fleet</HI></NOTE> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Command; where he was receiv'd by all the Officers and Seamen; with all po&s;&s;ible duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and with tho&s;e Ac+clamations <MILESTONE N="50"> which are peculiar to that People, and in which they excel.

The King treated all the Committee very graciou&s;ly toge|ther, and every one of them &s;everally and particularly very obligingly. So that &s;ome of them, who were con&s;cious to them&s;elves of their for|mer demerit, were very glad to find that they were not to fear any bit|terne&s;s from &s;o Princely, and &s;o generous a Nature.</P>
<P>THE City of <HI>London</HI> had had too great a hand in driving the Father <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> London <HI>&s;end</HI> 14 <HI>of their Ci|tizens.</HI></NOTE> of the King from thence, not to appear equally Zealous for his Son's return thither. <Q>And therefore they did, at the &s;ame time, &s;end four|teen of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens &startq;to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty of their fi|delity, and mo&s;t chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and that they placed all their felicity, and hope of future pro&s;perity in the a&s;&s;urance of his Maje&s;ty's Grace and Protection; for the meriting whereof, their lives and for|tunes&endq; &s;hould be allways at his Maje&s;ty's di&s;po&s;al;</Q> and they pre&s;ented to him from the City the Sum of ten thou&s;and pounds. <Q>The King told them, &startq;he had allways had a particular Affection for the City of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> the place of his Birth; and was very glad, that they had now &s;o good a part in his Re&s;toration; of which he was inform'd; and how&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> much he was beholding to every one of them;</Q> for which he thanked them very graciou&s;ly, and Knighted them all; an Honour no Man in the City had receiv'd in near twenty years, and with which they were much delighted.</P>
<P>IT will hardly be believ'd, that this Money pre&s;ented to the King by the Parliament and the City, and charged by Bills of Exchange upon the riche&s;t Merchants in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who had va&s;t E&s;tates, could not be receiv'd in many days, though &s;ome of the principal Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> who came to the King, went them&s;elves to &s;ollicite it, and <MILESTONE N="50"> had credit enough them&s;elves for much greater Sums, if they had brought over no Bills of Exchange. But this was not the fir&s;t time (of which &s;omewhat hath been &s;aid before) that it was evident to the
<PB N="601" REF="6130">
King, that it is not ea&s;y in that mo&s;t opulent City, with the help of all the rich Towns adjacent, and upon the greate&s;t credit, to draw toge|ther a great Sum of ready Money; the cu&s;tom of that Country, which flouri&s;hes &s;o much in Trade, being to make their payments in Paper by A&s;&s;ignations; they having very rarely occa&s;ion for a great Sum in any one particular place. And &s;o at this time his Maje&s;ty was compell'd, that he might not defer the voyage he &s;o impatiently long'd to make, to take Bills of Exchange from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> upon their Corre&s;pondents in <HI>London,</HI> for above thirty thou&s;and pounds of the Money that was a&s;&s;ign'd; all which was paid in <HI>London</HI> a&s;&s;oon as demanded. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>

<P><Q>THE King &s;poke very kindly to them; and &s;aid, &startq;that he had heard of their good behaviour towards him; and that he had no purpo&s;e to <MILESTONE N="30"> impo&s;e hard conditions upon them, with reference to their Con&s;ciences: that they well knew, he had referr'd the &s;ettling all differences of that nature to the wi&s;dom of the Parliament; which be&s;t knew what in|dulgence, and toleration, was nece&s;&s;ary for the Peace and Quiet of the&endq; Kingdom.</Q> But his Maje&s;ty could not be &s;o rid of them; they de|&s;ired <NOTE PLACE="marg">And their pri|vate di&s;cour&s;es al&s;o with him.</NOTE> &s;everal private Audiences of him; which he never denied; <Q>wherein they told him, &startq;the Book of Common-prayer had been long di&s;conti|nued in <HI>England,</HI> and the People having been di&s;u&s;ed to it, and many of them having never heard it in their lives, it would be much won|der'd at, if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould, at his fir&s;t landing in the Kingdom, revive the u&s;e of it in his own Chapel; whither all Per&s;ons would re|&s;ort; <MILESTONE N="40"> and therefore they be&s;ought him, that he would not u&s;e it en|tirely and formally, but have only &s;ome parts of it read, with mixture&endq; of other good Prayers, which his Chaplains might u&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King told them with &s;ome warmth, &startq;that whil&s;t he gave Them <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maje&s;ty's Reply to them.</NOTE> liberty, he would not have his own taken from him: that he had all|ways u&s;ed that form of Service, which he thought the be&s;t in the world, and had never di&s;continued it in places where it was more di&s;|liked than he hoped it was by Them: that when he came into <HI>England</HI> he would not &s;everely inquire how it was u&s;ed in other Churches, <MILESTONE N="50"> though he doubted not, he &s;hould find it u&s;ed in many; but he was&endq; &s;ure he would have no other u&s;ed in his own Chapel.</Q> <Q>Then they be|&s;ought him with more importunity, &startq;that the u&s;e of the Surplice might

That day his Maje&s;ty gave the Gar|ter to the General, and likewi&s;e to the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> (who had been elected many years before) and &s;ent it likewi&s;e by <HI>Garter,</HI> Herauld and King at Armes, to Admiral <HI>Moun|tague,</HI> who remain'd in the <HI>Downs.</HI></P>
<P>ON <HI>Monday</HI> He went to <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> and the next day, being the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 29 <HI>He $ame through the City to</HI> White-Hall.</NOTE> nine and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> and his Birth-day, he enter'd <HI>London;</HI> all <MILESTONE N="40"> the ways thither being &s;o full of People, and Acclamations, as if the whole Kingdom had been gather'd there. Between <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>South|wark</HI> the Lord Mayor and Aldermen met him, with all &s;uch Pro|te&s;tations of joy as can hardly be imagin'd. The Concour&s;e was &s;o great, that the King rode in a croud from the Bridge to <HI>White-Hall;</HI> all the Companies of the City &s;tanding in order on both &s;ides, and giving loud thanks to God for his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence. He no &s;ooner came to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> but the two Hou&s;es of Parliament &s;olemnly ca&s;t them&s;elves at his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the two Hou&s;es waited on him.</NOTE> Feet, with all vows of affection and fidelity to the world's end. <Q>In a <MILESTONE N="50"> word, the Joy was &s;o unexpre&s;&s;ible, and &s;o univer&s;al, that his Maje&s;ty &s;aid &s;milingly to &s;ome about him, &startq;he doubted it had been his own fault he had been ab&s;ent &s;o long; for he &s;aw no body that did not pro|te&s;t,&endq; he had ever wi&s;hed for his Return.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="603" REF="6150">
IN this wonderful manner, and with this incredible expedition, did <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conclu|&s;ion $$ the whole Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> God put an end to a Rebellion that had raged near twenty Years, and been carried on with all the horrid circum&s;tances of Murther, Deva&s;ta|tion, and Parricide, that fire and &s;word, in the hands of the mo&s;t wicked Men in the world, could be In&s;truments of; almo&s;t to the de&s;olation of two Kingdoms, and the exceeding defacing and deforming the third.</P>
<P>IT was but five Months, &s;ince <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Fanatical Army was &s;cat|ter'd and confounded, and General <HI>Monk</HI>'s march'd into <HI>England:</HI> it was but three Months, &s;ince the &s;ecluded Members were re&s;tored; and, &s;hortly after, the mon&s;trous long Parliament finally di&s;&s;olv'd, and rooted <MILESTONE N="10"> up: it was but a Month, &s;ince the King's Letters and Declaration were deliver'd to the New Parliament, afterwards call'd the <HI>Convention:</HI> on the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> they were deliver'd, and his Maje&s;ty was at <HI>White-Hall</HI> on the 29^t^h of the &s;ame Month.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e remarkable Steps, among others, did the merciful hand of God, in this &s;hort &s;pace of time, not only bind up and heal all tho&s;e wounds, but even make the Scars as undi&s;cernable, as, in re&s;pect of the deepne&s;s, was po&s;&s;ible; which was a glorious addition to the Deliverance. And, after this miraculous Re&s;toration of the Crown, and the Church, and the ju&s;t Rights of Parliaments, no Nation under Heaven can ever <MILESTONE N="20"> be more happy, if God &s;hall be plea&s;ed to add E&s;tabli&s;hment and Per|petuity to the Ble&s;&s;ings he then Re&s;tored.</P>
