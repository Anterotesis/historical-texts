<HEAD>THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE <HI>White-Staff,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_GEneral and Prime Mini&s;ters have this peculiar Fate, That as they have the Honour of other Mens Merit, &s;o they bear the Guilt of other Men's Crimes; nothing is more certain than that neither the one or the other, in tho&s;e high Stations, can act without the Agen|cy and Councils of &s;uch Seconds who, as they, ought to &s;hare in the Glory. So they have oftentimes &s;uch Influence in the Conduct of Affairs, and are &s;o far
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Ma&s;ters of the Schemes and Councils of the whole, that they cannot be clear of the Blame where Mi&s;carriages in Ma|nagement are to be accounted for.</P>
<P>Nor is this all, but as the &s;aid Prime Mini&s;ters cannot be &s;uppos'd to act by their own Hands, or advi&s;e by their own Councils in all things they do, or in eve|ry Branch of their Admini&s;tration; &s;o we often find that they have their more imme|diate Agents, by whom they not only may be &s;aid to act, and to whom they may be &s;aid to commit great part of the Management, but who oftentimes po&s;|&s;e&s;s their Councils &s;o entirely as to over|rule them in many things, and at la&s;t top upon their Ma&s;ters, and become in|dependent of them. We are not without Examples where &s;uch encroaching In&s;tru|ments have &s;upplanted tho&s;e who went before them, nay their very Benefactors, and &s;lipt into the Chair of Management at the Expence of tho&s;e that rais'd them to that Power, and who&s;e Creatures they were.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory is fruitful in Examples of this kind, and as it would be to no purpo&s;e, &s;o it would be tedious to tho&s;e who &s;hall read this Tract to enter into a Detail of Precedents. They who look into the Ac|counts
<PB N="5" REF="5">
of the mo&s;t recent Tran&s;actions of Court, will find a Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> &s;up|planting his Benefactre&s;s, and putting <HI>Ma|ry de Medicis,</HI> Queen Mother of <HI>France,</HI> under Confinement, removing her from the Regency and Admini&s;tration who had advanc'd him into the very Po&s;t, which gave him the Power and Advan|tage of u&s;ing her &s;o: <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> did the like even to the King that advanc'd him; and ano|ther Arch-Bi&s;hop, &s;ince that, &s;upplanted the very In&s;trument who brought him into Favour.</P>
<P>But we need not go &s;o far back for Examples of this kind, the brief Hi&s;tory which now lies before us will &s;upply us with a living De&s;cription of the&s;e things, and let us &s;ee how the Schemes of Admi|ni&s;tration, lodg'd in the mo&s;t judicious manner, and carried on with Succe&s;s un|expected by the whole Word, have been overturn'd by the Agency of tho&s;e In&s;tru|ments who acting with different Views from tho&s;e under who&s;e Conduct, and by who&s;e Authority, they were introduc'd; have &s;et up Schemes of their own, and thereby not only &s;upplanted tho&s;e who they acted under, but gone far in throw|ing this poor Nation into &s;uch Confu&s;ion,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
as might have been fatal to the publick Peace, if they had not been &s;trangely and providentially di&s;appointed in the very Juncture in which they hop'd to put their Projects in Execution.</P>
<P>How the&s;e things have been acted, from what Principle, to what End, and in what manner the Mines of State have been blown up, and the Mi&s;chief pre|vented, will be &s;een with great Clearne&s;s in the following Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons and Beginnings of the late Revolution at Court, under the Mini&s;try of the late Earl of <HI>Godo&mdash;in,</HI> are too many, and the Hi&s;tory too long to be entred upon in this Tract; it is evident &s;ome Steps in the Management of Affairs, at that time, gave another Party room to break in upon them, and at once both to &s;upplant their Power, and their Per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>And as if a Fate had attended that Mini&s;try, and that the Revolutions of the Admini&s;tration were inevitable, it is ob|&s;ervable they committed more Mi&s;takes in their Attempts even to defend them|&s;elves, and ward off the Blow, than at any time before; the&s;e were &s;uch as the Pro&s;ecution of Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> for a Sermon preach'd at <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Church, which by
<PB N="7" REF="7">
carrying their Re&s;entment up to an Im|peachment in Parliament, they made a popular Cau&s;e, and which receiv'd &s;o much Weight from the Warmth of the Pro&s;ecution, and Vigour of the Defence that it remov'd the Di&s;pute from the Per|&s;on to the Parties, embark'd the Church and its Intere&s;t in the Quarrel, and brought the Mini&s;try, without any &s;uch De&s;ign, to a Nece&s;&s;ity of acting as it were again&s;t the Church Intere&s;t it &s;elf, which they all were Members of.</P>
<P>We can have no room to doubt, but they were led into this Snare by the Ac|cident of that worthle&s;s Man's Sermon, who was not capable him&s;elf to do it with any &s;uch De&s;ign, or con&s;iderable enough to be employ'd by others that were; it being impo&s;&s;ible for the wi&s;e&s;t Head to fore&s;ee the Event, or to imagine that the Mini&s;try would either want Foreca&s;t &s;o much as to engage in &s;uch a litttle Affair, or want Strength to go through with it when they had engag'd.</P>
<P>When this Sermon was fir&s;t Preach'd, tho' it gave offence, yet no Man ever expected the Mini&s;try would trouble them&s;elves about it; when they began to &s;peak of it in the Hou&s;e of Commons, nothing could be expected more, than
<PB N="8" REF="8">
calling the Man before them, keeping him a little in Cu&s;tody, bringing him to the Bar, giving him a Reprimand, cen|&s;uring his Sermon to be burnt by the Hangman, &amp;c. But the Enemies of the Mini&s;try &s;eeing further than others, were the fir&s;t that laid the Bate to bring it up to an Impeachment, by which means they gain'd the Point they had long driven at, <HI>viz.</HI> To embroil the Mini&s;try with the Church, at which Gap they broke in upon the Mini&s;try, &s;upplanted them with the Queen, who&s;e Zeal for the Church could not permit her Maje&s;ty to gratify the Re&s;entment of her Mini|&s;ters upon a Clergyman, and from one thing to another they went on till they gain'd their End, and got a Super&s;edeas to the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> as the fir&s;t &s;tep to a ge|neral change of the Admini&s;tration, and at this Epocha, our Secret Hi&s;tory takes its beginning.</P>
<P>There were concurring Mi&s;takes at this time committed among them&s;elves, &s;uch as the Breach with a Secretary of State a little before, who they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Employment, with all the marks of Re&s;entment imaginable, even to In|decencies, and &s;uch Treatment which &s;ig|nified an A&s;&s;urance of their Power, and
<PB N="9" REF="9">
the utmo&s;t Di&s;regard to any thing he might be able to do again&s;t them to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice, and yet, at the &s;ame time, they knew that they were not able to &s;upplant him in the Favour of the Queen, or prevent Her Maje&s;ty giv|ing him di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of that Favour, even before their Faces, and al&s;o taking her Mea&s;ures from his Coun|cils, in Contradiction to the Steps which they had often taken, and which &s;ome|times gave them the Mortification of &s;i|lently &s;quaring their Mea&s;ures by his Schemes, that they might &s;eem to act from them&s;elves what they &s;hould proba|bly be obliged to do, after they had in vain oppo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>This &s;ecret Fire they neglected at fir&s;t, and impolitickly &s;uffer'd &s;o long to en|crea&s;e, till it broke out into a Flame, which they could never quench; and continuing ob&s;tinately to oppo&s;e the re|&s;toring that one Mini&s;ter, on Pre&s;umption, That the Queen would not venture to act without them; by this Mea&s;ure they lo&s;t the Queen her&s;elf, and by Con&s;e|quence &s;ell from the Admini&s;tration, and were &s;upplanted by that Hand, which they had not thought worth their while to apprehend any Danger from.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">
The Blow once given, and the Mini|&s;try di&s;plac'd, a new Scene opened, of which the like has not been known in the Ca&s;e of di&s;placing a Mini&s;try, and to this is owing the terrible Breaches which have &s;ince happened among us. It will be very much to the Purpo&s;e, and a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent De&s;ign, as laid down in the Title, to pur&s;ue, with Brevity, the Conduct of the &s;everal Parties &s;ub&s;equent to this Remove.</P>
<P>The <HI>White Staff</HI> being laid down, was, for the pre&s;ent, determined into five <HI>White-Staves,</HI> of whom the Per&s;on for whom Fare had de&s;igned it, was not made the Chief at fir&s;t, but had the Affair of the Exchequer &s;o put into his Hands, that in Effect, he might tran&s;act Things with more In&s;pection.</P>
<P>This is noted, to &s;ignify what has not been noticed &s;o much as it ought to have been; becau&s;e, that, Affairs taking a new Turn &s;oon after, the Prime Mini&s;ter had not Opportunity fully to di&s;cover, much le&s;s put in Practice, the fir&s;t Mea&s;ures he had taken for the Admini&s;tration, which apparently were to have made no man|ner of Alteration in publick Affairs, or of Per&s;ons either, further than Nece&s;&s;ity re|quired; that is to &s;ay, not to have altered
<PB N="11" REF="11">
the Mea&s;ures abroad, other than to rectify &s;ome things which wanted Redre&s;s, and bring our Allies to a more punctual Per|formance of the Stipulations and Agree|ments which they were under, that the Burthen of the War might have been more equally born; a Thing, which, however it was thought to be the Inven|tion of the New Managers, it is certain the Old Mini&s;try were &s;en&s;ible of, com|plain'd openly again&s;t, but did not think fit to carry any farther, for Rea|&s;ons which I will not think fit to deter|mine.</P>
<P>Nor were the New Mini&s;try re&s;olved only to go on upon the &s;ame Mea&s;ures of the Admini&s;tration, but even with the &s;ame Per&s;ons, a few excepted, had not the vigorous Oppo&s;ition made a|gain&s;t them, by the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e who were actually di&s;plac'd, made it ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;place others; and the Indi&s;cretion of many yet re&s;erved in Place, encrea&s;ed the Nece&s;&s;ity by De|grees to the Extreme which we have &s;ince &s;een it brought to.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Di&s;&s;olving the Par|liament became the Sub&s;tance of the Que&s;tion, which the di&s;plac'd Party would fain have prevented; but the o|ther
<PB N="12" REF="12">
had di&s;covered &s;o plainly, that the Endeavour to pre&s;erve the Parliament was with a De&s;ign to overthrow and de&s;troy the New Mini&s;try, that they could by no means abate that Article, and thereby give them the Opportu|nity.</P>
<P>This made the Breach irreconcilable, the di&s;placed People &s;hewed the utter|mo&s;t Re&s;entment, declared them&s;elves di&s;obliged to the highe&s;t, repre&s;ented the Mini&s;try as the Nation's Enemies upon all Occa&s;ions, and left no Stone unturn'd, by inflaming the People again&s;t them, running down the Credit, expo&s;ing them as Friends to the <HI>French</HI> Jacobites, and every thing that was bad.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try, on the other Hand, took Mea&s;ures to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves, and were, no que&s;tion, driven to make u&s;e both of Means and Hands which they never intended to make u&s;e of; for to &s;uch a Height were the Breaches by this means brought, that as nothing was omitted on one Side to attack, run down, and overthrow them; &s;o nothing was omitted on the Side of the Mini&s;try, to pre&s;erve them&s;elves: The&s;e unhappy Exigencies drove both Parties to do things which their own Friends blame them
<PB N="13" REF="13">
for, and which them&s;elves acknowledge, nothing but &s;uch a Nece&s;&s;ity could have oblig'd them to do, &s;uch as making <HI>twelve Lords</HI> on one hand, bringing in the <HI>Oc|ca&s;ional Bill</HI> on the other, and &s;everal the like extraordinary Steps, which are buried in this Relation, rather becau&s;e they &s;hould now be forgotten among us, than that they are not to the pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>White-Staff,</HI> which is the Clue we are to trace in this <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory,</HI> was now given into the Hand which, as was mentioned before, had been treated with &s;o much Impolitick Contempt, and the Prime Mini&s;try put upon that Head; which, altho' they always found capable, yet they never &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to think he could have gotten the Start of them, as they found he had; the Attempt made upon his Life by a Murtherer was &s;o horrid, that even tho&s;e who would not have been &s;orry to &s;ee his Fall, yet were &s;atisfied to &s;ee him e&s;cape &s;uch a Tragical Attempt; and as the Mi&s;|chief ha&s;tened his Advancement on the Queen's &s;ide, &s;o it abated &s;omething of the Re&s;entment on the other; and &s;ome had Hopes, that a Reconciliation, at lea&s;t of Mea&s;ures, if not of Per&s;ons,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
might have been brought about upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nor was the Prime Mini&s;ter wanting to &s;hew his Readine&s;s to bring things to an Accomodation; but the Breach was too wide, Things were gone too far. No Confidence could be fram'd among them, without which an Accomodation was altogether unpracticable; nor was there ever wanting Agents, on both &s;ides, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was to prevent every approach towards an Agreement; and to repre&s;ent to either &s;ide, that the other were not to be tru&s;ted; that at the &s;ame time that Application was made to heal the Breach, Mea&s;ures were &s;ecretly laid to &s;upplant one another, and the like.</P>
<P>By the&s;e and &s;uch like Arts, and with the Addition of &s;ome unhappy Practices, the Breach grew every Day wider; and all Reconciliation of Parties and Mea&s;ures being laid a&s;ide, the Party War grew up to that extravagant height, as the like has not been known in the&s;e Nations &s;ince the Civil War; for at the Revolution things came &s;ooner to a head.</P>
<P>The <HI>White-Staff</HI> however kept its Sta|tion, and the Policy and Management of the Prime Mini&s;ter defeated all the At|tempts which the di&s;plac'd Party had
<PB N="15" REF="15">
made, or &s;aw room to make, to break in upon him; in every Attack they were repuls'd; in every Battle he had the Victory; and albeit they never fail'd to renew their A&s;&s;aults, yet they found him &s;o well fortify'd in every Part, that many began to &s;ee their Mi&s;take, and to own they had better have accommodated things at fir&s;t; that they never thought he could have maintain'd him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as they found; and that no Head but his could have extricated it &s;elf out of &s;uch Labyrinths, e&s;cap'd &s;o many Snares, and brought him&s;elf out of &s;o many Difficulties, as he had done. The very Things which they thought to have o|verthrown him mo&s;t effectually by, they found them&s;elves obliged to turn to his Advantage; and he received the Thanks even of &s;ome of their own Friends, in tho&s;e Parts of his Admini&s;tration which they thought were mo&s;t open to their Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>For Example.</HI> In the Affair of the <HI>Ca|talans,</HI> where the Sugge&s;tion was very &s;trong, of having abandoned a faithful People, who we had drawn into a ter|rible War, to the Ruine of their Coun|try; and that we had left them, without taking &s;ufficient Care of them to pre&s;erve
<PB N="16" REF="16">
them from the Re&s;entment of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had not concerned our &s;elves to obtain Peace and Safety for them, or to oblige the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to treat them as the re&s;t of the Subjects.</P>
<P>Whereas, upon a full Examination of the Affair, it was found, that we had fully and punctually di&s;charg'd all Engage|ments to them, had obtain'd Safety, an Act of Oblivion, and a Grant of as great Privileges to them as they enjoy'd when we fir&s;t engag'd with them. That we left them in the Hands of the Emperor, who&s;e Subjects they cho&s;e to be, and who&s;e Duty it was to have taken Care of them, and to have made farther Conditi|on for them, if it had been rea&s;onable; and who could not be &s;aid not to be as able to defend them, as they have been to defend them&s;elves? That however the Ob&s;tinacy of the <HI>Catalans,</HI> and their de|manding &s;uch Privileges to be re&s;tor'd to them, as they had lo&s;t before we were any way concern'd with them, which Privileges Her Maje&s;ty never undertook to procure for them, nor indeed could ever expect, has been the &s;ole Rea&s;on of their Misfortunes.</P>
<P>That neverthele&s;s the Queen, or, to &s;peak in their own Terms, the Mini&s;try
<PB N="17" REF="17">
had not fail'd to make &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing In|&s;tances, both at the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Court and at the <HI>French,</HI> for the granting Peace and rea&s;onable Privileges to the <HI>Catalans,</HI> that it was confe&s;s'd more could not have been done; and that the <HI>Catalans</HI> were &s;o re|&s;olute again&s;t all Propo&s;als of Accommo|dation, and in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;uch Grants, that no Sovereign could be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;toop to.</P>
<P>Things appearing thus, it was acknow|ledg'd publickly, by &s;ome Men of Honour, who were neverthele&s;s in the Intere&s;t of the other Party, that they did not think the Mini&s;try had acted &s;o far in the In|tere&s;t of the <HI>Catalans;</HI> and that it was not po&s;&s;ible to do any more, than to con|tinue to make the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances with the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> &s;o that all this Charge was brought to an Addre&s;s of Thanks for the Care taken of the <HI>Catalans,</HI> and to de&s;ire it might be continued.</P>
<P>The next thing was, a Complaint of di&s;tributing Pen&s;ions among certain of the <HI>Highland Clans</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which by tho&s;e fir&s;t, who either were willing to conceal what they knew, or really knew no better, was &s;ugge&s;ted to be a &s;ecret &s;upporting of <HI>Jacobites,</HI> Enemies to the Con&s;titution, and open Favourers
<PB N="18" REF="18">
of the Pretender; a great length this Charge went among the common People, and was, for &s;ome time, taken as an un|deniable Proof, that the Prime Mini&s;ter had a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with, and paid con&s;iderable Sums of Money to, the Heads of the <HI>Highlanders</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were known to be in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>French,</HI> and of the Pretender. At la&s;t this was ripened up to the Charge, and was brought into Examination in the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>But when Matters were laid open, when the People were de&s;crib'd, the Na|ture of the Place, the Per&s;ons to whom, and the End for which the Money was paid; how &s;mall a Sum it was, how Effectually it had an&s;wered the End; and above all, when it appear'd that the like Sum, for the like Ends, was di&s;tribute$ in the former Mini&s;try; That by thi Money, &s;o many and &s;uch powerful <HI>Clan</HI> were kept in their Duty, pre&s;erv'd in th Intere&s;t of the Government, and pr$|vented from taking the like, or great$ Pen&s;ions, to enter into Engagement wit <HI>France;</HI> The&s;e things being &s;o effectuall clear'd up, as that even the Accu&s;ers we$ convinc'd of the Truth, they gave $word$ the Cau&s;e, acknowledg'd that the Mon$ was well imploy'd, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">
Thus, as above, the very Attacks made upon the Prime Mini&s;ter turn'd all into Victories; every one of which fortify'd his Intere&s;t, and made him &s;tronger than be|fore. There are many more Ca&s;es which i&s;&s;ued like the&s;e to his Advantage, &s;o that the other People began to &s;ee there was no more room left to expect Succe&s;s again&s;t him, and nothing but the Life of the Queen, which &s;eemed many times to be in danger, gave them any Pro&s;pect of overthrowing the <HI>White Staff.</HI></P>
<P>This leads us into a new Scene of Ma|nagement, and will di&s;cover that part, of which little has hitherto been known. For we are to note, that when the Victory of the <HI>White-Staff</HI> was, to outward Ap|pearance, compleat, and the di&s;placed Party &s;eem'd, even by their own Con|fe&s;&s;ion, to have nothing left to do but to de&s;pair; then was the real Conflict greater than ever, and he had a greater Difficulty to withhold the Rage of tho&s;e who were for u&s;ing their Advantages with Rigour, and entirely cru&s;hing, ruining, and op|pre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e whom he had reduced, than he had had before either to reduce them, or to pre&s;erve him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Staff</HI> had hitherto proceeded with a &s;teady Re&s;olution to maintain the Au|thority
<PB N="20" REF="20">
and Power he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and had, as before, &s;ucce&s;sfully fru&s;trated and di&s;|appointed all the Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e who would have overthrown and pulled him down: But it was apparent, that Victory being obtained, he had no farther Schemes of Oppo&s;ition to pur&s;ue; that it was not in his De&s;ign to cru&s;h and ruin the Per|&s;ons he &s;truggled with, or to erect any Dominion over them, as <HI>Britains;</HI> that he had no State-Tyranny to erect, no &s;e|cret De&s;igns to betray the Con&s;titution, and this Negative introduced a War be|tween him and tho&s;e who, to outward Appearance, were in the &s;ame Intere&s;t with him, which at la&s;t broke out into a Flame, which produced unlooked for Events, which will be part of the Subject of the re&s;t of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Hands which hitherto had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> and which, as before, he was obliged to u&s;e, by the Oppo&s;ition he met with from the di&s;placed Party, were not the ea&s;ie&s;t to be governed of any in the World; and that we may introduce this Part with Clearne&s;s, it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enter into Characters a little way, not of Per&s;ons, for this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall not be rendered inviduous, but of Parties.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">
In Appearance, the general Divi&s;ion of Parties were known not by Tory and Whig, as formerly, but by New Mi|ni&s;try and Old. But yet, among tho&s;e who were e&s;teemed Friends to the new Mini&s;try, there were &s;everal &s;ubdivided Parties of People, who acted with diffe|rent Views, and on different Principles from the <HI>White-Staff</HI> him&s;elf, and two of the&s;e only &s;hall be mentioned here.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Party, who being really <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> in their Principles, went with the Mini&s;try, in hopes of finding an Oppor|tunity, out of the general Di&s;tractions, to produce &s;omething to the Advantage of that Party they adhered to, and to promote the Intere&s;t of the Pretender. Perhaps they might be &s;o far impo&s;ed up|on, as to believe, that the De&s;ign of alter|ing the Succe&s;&s;ion was entertained by the Managers with whom they acted, though it was very &s;trange, Men of any &s;ence could be &s;o weak: Nor was it an im|politick Step, if any Methods were taken to nouri&s;h their Folly in that Opi|nion, while at the &s;ame time it not only engaged them heartily in the Mea&s;ures of the Mini&s;try, but effectually took them off from all their other <HI>Jacobite</HI> Projects, and from all their Foreign Intere&s;ts and
<PB N="22" REF="22">
Expectations, and turned their Hands and Eyes to a fooli&s;h Expectation, in which, had they had the lea&s;t fore&s;ight, they could not but &s;ee they were droped in the beginning, and mu&s;t effectually be di&s;appointed in the End. Indeed nothing could be more ab&s;urd than this Phantome of the Jacobites, of believing the <HI>White-Staff</HI> was in their Intere&s;t; and by being made to entertain that Dream, they ham|&s;tringed their Cau&s;e, and &s;uffered them|&s;elves, both within Doors and without, to be made the In&s;truments and Agents to make that impo&s;&s;ible, which they &s;an|cied they were bringing to pa&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The other Party, who acted in concurrence with the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> were a &s;et of High, Hot, out of Temper Politicians, who&s;e view was within them&s;elves, and who acting upon Prin|ciples of ab&s;olute Government, pu&s;hed at e&s;tabli&s;hing their Party in a Power or Ca|pacity of Governing by the Severity of the Law; to &s;ay no farther.</P>
<P>The&s;e found the <HI>White-Staff</HI> a great deal of Trouble; and account whereof, and of its beginning, will make our Secret Hi&s;tory compleat.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men, in the beginning of the Change, of which an Account is given
<PB N="23" REF="23">
above, began to &s;hew them&s;elves, and pu&s;h'd hard at the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> to intro|duce the Tyrannical part, which they al|ways profe&s;&s;ed, into his Admini&s;tration; and to &s;hew that they were able to in|fluence things by their Numbers, and to oblige him to it, if they could not other|wi&s;e prevail; to this purpo&s;e they &s;epa|rated them&s;elves early from the new Men, &s;et up for them&s;elves, obtained a Title by way of Dignity, as well as of Di|&s;tinction, of the <HI>OCTOBER CL&V;B,</HI> and pretended to act upon Schemes of their own; but the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> who knew that the&s;e Precipitations tended to ruin, not the Con&s;titution only, but them&s;elves, &s;oon found out methods to unty this knot, and by &s;ilent, quiet Steps, in a little time, he &s;o effectually &s;eparated the&s;e Gentlemen, that in le&s;s than Six Months, the Name of the <HI>October-Club</HI> was forgotten in the World, as if &s;uch a thing had never been heard of: nay, with &s;o much Addre&s;s was this At|tempt overthrown, that he lo&s;t not the Men, tho' he put them by their De&s;ign, but united them again, in pro&s;ecuting the Mea&s;ures which he had laid down, and giving up their own: This was a Victory of great moment to the <HI>White-Staff,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="24">
and without which he had lo&s;t the Day to the di&s;plac'd Party in the other Engagements, of which mention is made before.</P>
<P>Things now went on for &s;ome time with more ea&s;e; the <HI>White-Staff</HI> acted, as in his fir&s;t De&s;ign, with a re&s;erve to his own De&s;igns, <HI>viz.</HI> in a medium be|tween all the extreams of Parties; and tho' by this he was &s;ure to &s;atisfy nei|ther &s;ide, and be complained of and op|po&s;ed by all, yet he ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that no other Method could &s;upport the Go|vernment; that nothing but clo&s;e Mea|&s;ures, Moderation, Temper, and Time, could carry the Point; that the Party he had to do with, were as Hot the other way; and that this <HI>October</HI> Project would pre&s;ently expo&s;e them all to a vigilant and powerful Party, who would not fail to break in at the fir&s;t Gap that was made in the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;tifled the fir&s;t Attack of the&s;e Men, the <HI>White-Staff</HI> went on in his Admini&s;tration with the Succe&s;s above|mention'd; and about the latter end of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, People thought he had ma&s;ter'd all the Difficul|ties that were before him; but the violent Spirit of the&s;e Men found him a new &s;trug|gle.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25">
They had long endeavour'd to bring him to their Mea&s;ures, <HI>(viz.)</HI> They told him that it was Time to &s;trike home, <HI>as it was called,</HI> at the whole Party; to give the Whigs the <HI>Coup de Grace,</HI> that they might die at once; to make a thorough Reformation, by di&s;placing every Whig or Moderate Man in the Nation; to carry a <HI>&s;treight Rein,</HI> and make the Govern|ment formidable, to re&s;tore the Preroga|tive, and make the People know their Duty; To rule by Law, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> was to put the Laws effectually in Execution; and not make the Law a Terror to the Mini&s;try, in&s;tead of being a Terror to the People. That there was no way to quell Sedition, but by Correction; That Ju&s;tice was made u&s;e of again&s;t a Faction, to keep them down before they get up, as well as to pull them down when they are up; That they had now gain'd an en|tire Victory, and they were not to act like <HI>Hannibal,</HI> who, having overthrown the <HI>Romans,</HI> had the Benefit of his Victo|ry wrung out of his Hands for want of a vigorous following his Blow; That now was their time to &s;uppre&s;s effectually the Whigs, who had thus long &s;truggled with them; That a home Blow now would for ever knock them down, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26">
The&s;e were the Topicks the&s;e Politi|cians went upon, and Night and Day they be&s;ieged the <HI>White-Staff</HI> with their Importunities on this Head, who, &s;till re&s;olving to act only upon the Defen&s;ive, and not to ruin the Per&s;ons of the other, tho' he had broken them as a Party, re|main'd inflexible; he told them, They were to content them&s;elves with redu|cing the Power of their Oppo&s;ers, with|out turning Oppre&s;&s;ors; That it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to baffle their Attempts, who endeavour'd to overthrow the Admini|&s;tration, but not to think that to over|throw the Con&s;titution was the way to pre&s;erve the Government; That they fought to conquer, and conquer'd to &s;ave; That they were to con&s;ider the Whigs as a part of the Queen's Subjects, who, though, they were to be re&s;trained, were not to be oppre&s;s'd, much le&s;s de|&s;troy'd; That they &s;truggled with the oppo&s;ite Party to keep them from Tyran|nizing, but were not to tyrannize in their &s;tead. On the other Hand, he told them, it was not their Part to pu&s;h; that they were now <HI>IN the Mini&s;try,</HI> and ought to ri&s;que nothing; their bu&s;ine&s;s was to pre&s;erve them&s;elves in the Admini&s;tra|tion where they were, and be &s;atisfied
<PB N="27" REF="27">
with doing &s;o; that it was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the other to be de&s;perate, and to run at All, hazarding every thing, becau&s;e they had nothing to &s;take; That the Ca&s;e of the Mini&s;try differ'd, who had nothing to wi&s;h more than they enjoy'd, and nothing to ask but to keep their Station.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, he repre&s;ented to them, that as Temper and Forbearance had given them all the Advantages they had hitherto gain'd; &s;o this was the only Way to &s;ecure them&s;elves in tho&s;e Advantages. That if they govern'd with Moderation, when they had compleatly e&s;tabli&s;h'd their Power, they &s;hould rivet them&s;elves in the Admini&s;tration, by gaining the Hearts of the People; where|as pu&s;hing their Re&s;entments by hot and furious Methods, would give Strength to their Oppo&s;ers, produce new Factions, and new Parties again&s;t them&s;elves; and by rai&s;ing a general Aver&s;ion again&s;t them among the People, make way for their Fall on the fir&s;t popular Fray that &s;hould happen, at which the Party would not fail to break in upon and overthrow them, as they had done by the former Mini&s;ters, on the unfore&s;een Accident of Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Sermon.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28">
He repre&s;ented the Ca&s;e of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion to them in lively Terms, told them, That if by any Mea&s;ures they &s;hould once give the People an univer|&s;al Jealou&s;y, that they were not Friends to the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hanover,</HI> they would not fail to &s;plit on that Rock, and bring upon them&s;elves the ju&s;t Re&s;entment of the whole Nation; That it was out of doubt, that no other Succe&s;&s;ion but that of <HI>Hanover</HI> could be thought of, &s;o they that were of the Mini&s;try, ought to give the Princes of that Hou&s;e, and the People here al&s;o, all po&s;&s;ible Satisfaction, that there was no De&s;ign to prejudice that Succe&s;&s;ion; That, on the contrary, it was their Intere&s;t to let the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hano|ver</HI> &s;ee, that the Mini&s;try were entirely in their Intere&s;t, &s;o to make them&s;elves the real Support of the Succe&s;&s;ion, and that the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;hould &s;uc|ceed upon the Foot of their Admini&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>In order to this, the <HI>White-Staff</HI> took Care to apply him&s;elf to the Court of <HI>Hanover,</HI> by &s;uch Mini&s;ters of Tru&s;t a were proper to &s;atisfy the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, that he was entirely in their In|tere&s;t; and that the Queen, notwith&s;tand+ing the Clamour that was rai&s;ed, ha$

not entertained the De&s;ign to their Pre|judice; to confirm which, Her Maje&s;ty was prevailed with, in Her Letter to the late Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> to offer, That if Her Highne&s;s <HI>would open Her&s;elf with Free|dom</HI> to Her Maje&s;ty, <HI>and propo&s;e any thing for their further</HI> Satisfaction and Security, in the Matter of the Succe&s;&s;ion, Her Maje&s;ty would <HI>come into it with Zeal.</HI> See Her Maje&s;ty's Letter.</P>
<P>But this Di&s;cour&s;e had no Effect upon the&s;e Men, unle&s;s it was to help form their Re&s;olutions again&s;t all Moderate Mea&s;ures, and again&s;t all that oppo&s;ed the Methods of their own pre&s;cribing; at which they were &s;o fix'd and unalte|rably re&s;olved, that they not only refu&s;|ed to concert with the <HI>White-Staff</HI> the Mea&s;ures of their future Conduct, but &s;et up to oppo&s;e him, and underwork him in every thing he went about: Not con|tent with this, they began openly to cen|&s;ure his Conduct, charging him with Re&s;erves in his Admini&s;tration, and with taking Mea&s;ures prejudicial to the Intere&s;t in which they were engaged.</P>
<P>This was thus far among them&s;elves only, and Friends were not wanting to endeavour on both Sides an Accommoda|tion, but it was impo&s;&s;ible; nothing

would &s;erve the&s;e Men, but what was &s;o de&s;tructive to their own, as well as to the publick Safety, that the <HI>White-Staff</HI> could not be brought to recede from his Re&s;olution, or to pur&s;ue the immoderate Steps which he found them re&s;olv'd up|on. As it was impo&s;&s;ible to bring them to Terms with one another, &s;o was it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the Breach going farther, and the Con&s;equences being made publick.</P>
<P>From private Complaints, it came to publick Reproaches: They give out a|mong their own Friends, That the <HI>White-Staff</HI> was a Whig in his Heart; That he was bred a Fanatick, and retain'd &s;till a warm Side to the Di&s;&s;enters; That he had hitherto acted a Part only with the High-Church; had taken them in but as Tools, becau&s;e the other would not join with him, and becau&s;e he could not carry on his De&s;igns without them; That hav|ing now got into Power, and made him|&s;elf a <HI>White-Staff</HI> by their Intere&s;t, he had no more to do, but to make his Peace with the Whigs at their Expence, and betray them to &s;ecure his Retreat.</P>
<P>The&s;e Clamours, tho' they gave &s;ome Vent to their Pa&s;&s;ions, yet they did not effectually an&s;wer their End, unle&s;s &s;ome

Exemplifications might be appeal'd to, and &s;ome Facts be brought upon the Stage, which might be convincing to the World. Two Ca&s;es were either originally con|triv'd, or artfully turn'd, to &s;erve this Pur|po&s;e, and both were carried to the ut|mo&s;t Extent upon the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> to put him as it were to the Te&s;t, and bring his Principles to the Touch-&s;tone.</P>
<P>The Church-men, who fell in with this new high Party, had long com|plain'd of the Liberty which was given, or conniv'd at, for the keep|ing of private Academies, Grammar-Schools, and other Schools, by the Di&s;&s;en|ters, though a Law was in full Force a|gain&s;t it. This, as a Grievance to the Church, had been often complain'd of, but never redre&s;s'd: The Juncture &s;erves &s;undry ways. The <HI>Church-men</HI> are &s;erv'd, by taking hold of this Opportunity to obtain what they had &s;o long in vain de|&s;ired, and &s;o often in vain attempted. The <HI>States-men</HI> are &s;erv'd by having an Opportunity, as they &s;uppo&s;e, to pu&s;h at the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> and plunge him into the Difficulty of explaining him&s;elf one way or other; and a <HI>Private View</HI> was &s;erv'd, of letting the Queen &s;ee, as they call'd it, who were mo&s;t Zealous for the Church,

<P>This Mine being fully charg'd, was &s;prung with great Expectation of Suc|ce&s;s, the Bill for preventing the Growth of Schi&s;m was brought in. Neither the Bi&s;h&mdash;who &s;ollicited it, the P&mdash;r that clo&s;ed with it, or the Commoner who negotiated it, thought it po&s;&s;ible that it could fail in its Execution. If the <HI>White-Staff</HI> oppo&s;e it, &s;aid they, we have our Point; the Queen will &s;ee that all we have &s;aid of him is true, and that he is but a Fanatick in Di&s;gui&s;e; and it will then be no hard matter to incen&s;e her Maje&s;ty, who is &s;o heartily in the Church's Intere&s;t, again&s;t him, and he will in|fallibly &s;ink under the Church's Re&s;ent|ment; but if he joins with it, then he effectually and irreconcilably provokes the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;trips him&s;elf of his private Friends, is lo&s;t without a Retreat, and we &s;hall ea&s;ily make them hereafter In&s;tru|ments to de&s;troy him.</P>
<P>The Secret of this piece of Manage|ment is &s;o well known, that we have no Apology to make for it, &s;ave that it can hardly be called a &s;ecret Hi&s;tory. That
<PB N="33" REF="33">
the Schi&s;m-Bill was a Mine dug to blow up the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> is known to every one that knows any thing of publick Matters; yet even here the Staff &s;tood its ground, he was &s;o well acquainted with their Ma|nagement in all its Steps, and made him|&s;elf &s;o effectually Ma&s;ter of the Plot, even before it broke out, that he baffled them both ways; for he, as it were, ca&s;trated the Bill, took out all the malicious and per&s;ecuting Part which the <HI>Wild-&s;ire-men,</HI> who were fir&s;t in the De&s;ign, had form'd to ruin Families and oppre&s;s the People, let it pa&s;s with all in it that was really u&s;eful for the Church's Advantage, and yet left it unable to do the Mi&s;chief which it was de&s;ign'd for: Thus the <HI>White-Staff</HI> neither di&s;covered him&s;elf one way or other, by which means the Politicians were effectually di&s;appointed, the At|tempt to &s;ap the <HI>White-Staff</HI> and its In|tere&s;t proved Abortive, and he yet held his hold, without receiving any Wound from this Attempt; except that for a while, the Di&s;&s;enters laid the Blame of that Bill, as an Attack upon their Tole|ration, at his Door; which, as it was the Effect of their lgnorance only, &s;o they are &s;ince that fully &s;atisfy'd of their Mi&s;take.</P>

The next was a very peculiar Step of this Party, and by which they opened them&s;elves too freely, and very much to their Di&s;advantage. This was relating to the Payment of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Troops; the&s;e Troops were part of that Body, who, when they parted from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> were kept out of their Pay, by Virtue of the Declaration of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Or&mdash;nd,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;That none of the Troops in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Pay, &s;hould receive any Sub&s;i&s;tance after they had declin'd to obey the Orders of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General.</Q> It is no part of our Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew here, why the &s;aid Debt ought, or ought not to be paid; the Mini&s;ter of <HI>Hanover</HI> pre&s;&s;ing the Payment of that Money, a Motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons to make Provi&s;ion for it, the Sum amounted to 65022<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>The Party mentioned above, took hold of this Article, and, as if they had a grea Advantage given them again&s;t the <HI>White Staff,</HI> repre&s;ented this as a great A&s;&s;ror to her Maje&s;ty: That it was apparent th <HI>White-Staff</HI> was carrying on his own Gan at the Court of <HI>Hanover:</HI> That he wou never permit an honourable Emba&s;&s;y be &s;ent thither; but that he always ke his Kin&s;man there without any Charact
<PB N="35" REF="35">
but as a common Me&s;&s;enger: That he was making his Court privately to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and &s;ought to have the Elector think him&s;elf obliged to him <HI>[Staff]</HI> for the procuring this Payment.</P>
<P>How far they pu&s;h'd this Point, is well known; they not only &s;topt the Motion, and prevented the Ju&s;tice that would other|wi&s;e have been done to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|over;</HI> but prejudiced the Queen in it al&s;o, as if the Motion had been a Di&s;honour to her, and that the Staff had formed his Intere&s;t at <HI>Hanover</HI> at her Maje|&s;ty's Expence; how far this was im|prov'd to the Prejudice of the <HI>Write-Staff,</HI> with his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hall not enter upon here, her Maje&s;ty being removed; But I dare &s;ay, no one will think that this did the <HI>White-Staff</HI> any Prejudice in the Court of <HI>Hanover;</HI> or that it will be any pre&s;ent Di&s;advantage to him, in the Opinion of tho&s;e who have been con&s;tant Friends of the Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>From this time they &s;eem'd to gain ground upon the <HI>White-Staff,</HI> albeit their Advantage could not be &s;o much grounded on this par|ticular Ca&s;e, without reproaching the Di&s;|cretion, as well as Ju&s;tice of &s;ome Body el&s;e; the <HI>White-Staff</HI> having done no|thing in this, but what became him on
<PB N="36" REF="36">
&s;everal Accounts: E&s;pecially in Honour to the Queen, and in Ju&s;tice to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to whom the Money was fairly due, and the Publick Faith &s;tood engaged for the Payment.</P>
<P>If the <HI>White-Staff</HI> &s;unk in the E&s;teem of any Body from that time, it was a very happy Occa&s;ion, &s;eeing the Rea&s;on was this, and none other, <HI>viz.</HI> That they found him immoveably attach'd to the In|tere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and in|&s;eparably engaged to that of the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> Nor were the Prin|ces of that Hou&s;e &s;o unacquainted with Things and Per&s;ons in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, as to be ignorant of it.</P>
<P>The appearing for the <HI>Hanover</HI> In|tere&s;t, at that time, was al&s;o a mo&s;t &s;ea|&s;onable Aid to the Intere&s;t it &s;elf; For at this time the Nation, whether with or without Cau&s;e, was exceedingly a|larmed with Apprehen&s;ions, not only of the Preparations and formidable Strength of the Pretender, but al&s;o of &s;ome &s;e|cret De&s;igns among great Per&s;ons, for the propagating his Intere&s;t in the&s;e King|doms; and however, we will hope none of the Mini&s;try could be capable of &s;o directly oppo&s;ing the true Intere&s;t of their Country, yet it is well known that the
<PB N="37" REF="37">
People, who &s;pread the&s;e Reports, were not at all backward in declaring, that they believed the Mini&s;try them&s;elves were guilty of tho&s;e De&s;igns.</P>
<P>I will not di&s;honour the Sence and Under&s;tanding of any Member of the Mi|ni&s;try &s;o far, as to believe any thing of it, or to &s;ay that there was a &s;ufficient Foun|dation for &s;uch a Charge: Certainly they had too much Knowledge of the Nature and Efficacy of the Parliamentary Provi|&s;ion, made for the immediate Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to think the Inter|e&s;t of the Pretender could ever be made Practicable; and too much Regard to their own Heads, to ri&s;que them on &s;o Impracticable a De&s;ign. But the matter of Fact lay here, there were many real <HI>Jacobites</HI> among the People, whom, as things &s;tood, they cared not to di&s;oblige; and this re&s;trained them from decla|ring in Favour of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> &s;o clearly as otherwi&s;e they might have done, lea&s;t the other &s;hould break in upon them, when divided from their Friends.</P>
<P>But the <HI>White-Staff</HI> was of another Opinion: For he having, as before, con|quered the <HI>Di&s;placed Party,</HI> and carried his Point &s;o far, as that he was out of
<PB N="38" REF="38">
Fear of any farther Attempt from them, he thought they could no longer deny giving the Nation a full and ample De|claration of their being &s;incerely embark'd in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, and that there was no Danger of the Pre|tender from the Mini&s;try. He took this not only to be a Ju&s;tice due to the People, but al&s;o the true Intere&s;t of his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, and of the Admini&s;tration al&s;o, to whom, e&s;pecially to the Queen, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to quiet the Minds of her People, and make all her Subjects ea&s;ie in &s;o important an Affair as that of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it might be &s;ome Motive to this, that the <HI>White-Staff</HI> thought it hard to be continually reproach'd with being in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and was im|patient to vindicate him&s;elf from a Charge which he lay under, meerly by waiting the Mea&s;ures of other Men, and from which he could &s;o ea&s;ily and effectually purge him&s;elf, and &s;o much to the Satisfaction, not of the People only, but of the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And it cannot but be a little ob&s;erv|able here, How the <HI>Di&s;placed Party</HI> mal|treated the <HI>White-Staff</HI> all this while, as being embark'd with the Pretender; and
<PB N="39" REF="39">
that this Court-Faction was, <HI>at the &s;ame time,</HI> undermining him, becau&s;e of his being &s;ecretly at work for, and engag'd in the Intere&s;t of, the Elector of <HI>Hano|ver;</HI> how the&s;e Contraries agreed, re|mains for this Secret Hi&s;tory to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>It was now high Time for the <HI>White-Staff</HI> to be in earne&s;t to him&s;elf; his own Pre&s;ervation, a thing he had not always li&s;ten'd much to, call'd upon him to draw out from a Party, who were re&s;olute to precipitate them&s;elves, and the publick Affairs, into inextricable Labyrinths. Nor was this all, but as the Succe&s;s of all their De&s;igns was to be their own Advan|tage, &s;o was the Mi&s;carriages to be all at his Expence; for the <HI>White Staff</HI> being &s;uppo&s;ed to be at the Head of all Affairs, the Odium of every fal&s;e Step was &s;ure to be laid there, the popular Hatred was certain to center there, and he was like to be charg'd with the very Mi|&s;takes, which he had openly and avow|edly oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nor was this come to a contemptible Height; for as the Conduct of the&s;e Men gave daily Unea&s;ine&s;s to the People, and the Charge of the Mini&s;try being in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, became very popular. It was not without Ground,
<PB N="40" REF="40">
that the <HI>White-Staff</HI> was thought to be in Danger of being &s;acrific'd to popular Fu|ry, if any Attempt in Favour of the Pre|tender had really been made; for who can an&s;wer for the Rage of a Rabble in the Heat of a Tumult, where they have any &s;ingle Man pointed out to them as the Cau&s;e of all their Grievances?

been &s;o &s;natch'd away from the head of Affairs: But it was plain to many Ob|&s;ervers, That the Queen began, even in two days, to &s;ee that her Goodne&s;s was im|pos'd upon; This is evident, in that the <HI>White-Staff</HI> having, in a while after this, &s;hifted hands, it was fix'd, by the Royal Direction, in Hands as different from their Views who obtain'd it to be re|moved, as it was before, and as unex|pected and &s;urpri&s;ing to the People we are &s;peaking of, as a Clap of <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Thunder to a Female Sooth&s;ayer.</P>
<P>But as the pre&s;ent Hi&s;tory relates much to this Remove, &s;o whatever is not pro|per to be mention'd mu&s;t remain to be &s;een by the Con&s;equences, lea&s;t we fol|low Truth too clo&s;e at the Heels, and obtain the Di&s;a&s;ter of touching the Follies of &s;ome Men, before they are di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Power to re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>That Female Buz which had, for ma|ny Years pa&s;t, too much Influence in pub|lick Management, began now to work; and Men of State thought fit to plough with the Hei&s;ers of the Court: It matter'd not how far Honour and Gratitude oblig'd them to have acted upon other Principles, when once their &s;ecret Intelligences inform'd them, that

by this means, they had a fair View of bringing their De&s;igns to pa&s;s, they &s;oon broke through tho&s;e little things called Obligations; forgetting who rai&s;ed them, and by who&s;e Conduct they had been &s;upported again&s;t all the Attempts of a Party, which, had they &s;tood alone, would have cru&s;h'd them into Attoms of Di&s;grace and Contempt, even with one of their Fingers.</P>
<P>But the glittering Hopes of getting the <HI>White-Staff</HI> into their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the eager De&s;ires of having an Opportunity thereby, to put in Execution tho&s;e wicked De&s;igns, which had been long &s;eated in their Imagination, and which they knew, by many Demon&s;trations, the <HI>Staff</HI> would never give way to; the&s;e things, I &s;ay, prevail'd with them to tram|ple under their Feet the Honour and Duty of Servants to the Queen, and the Prin|ciples of Re&s;pect and Gratitude to that &s;uperior Genius, who had formerly &s;erv'd and obliged them in the highe&s;t Degree; and <HI>which was yet wor&s;e,</HI> to quit all that Re|gard which, as Mini&s;ters of State, they owed to the publick Good, and the Peace of their Country, which they well enough knew was centred in that one Capital Article of the Con&s;titution, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44">
It can never be &s;ufficiently lamented by every true Subject of <HI>Britain,</HI> How far the Honour, Dignity, and Reputation of the Queen became a Sacrifice in the Hands of the&s;e Men; How far they a|bandon'd the Regard which in Duty they owed to their Sovereign's Veracity; How far they expo&s;ed their Sincerity, which every one that knew intimately the Queen's Conduct, knew her Maje&s;ty acted with in every thing &s;he did; I &s;ay, How they expo&s;ed it to common Cen|u&s;re, and how the Enemies of the Go|vernment took Occa&s;ion, from their Con|duct, to &s;ugge&s;t, <HI>That the Queen her &s;elf had private Aver&s;ions to the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, a warm Side to the Pre|tender, and that &s;he was entred into Mea&s;ures for the latter again&s;t the for|mer.</HI></P>
<P>Though I cannot by any Means allow, that there was the lea&s;t Truth in any part of the&s;e Sugge&s;tions, yet it cannot be denyed, but that the Conduct of the&s;e Men, and the Influence of their Female Agents at Court, made the Rea|&s;ons which &s;ome Men gave for tho&s;e Sug|ge&s;tions too plau&s;ible; and albeit the known Principles on which her Maje&s;ty always acted, <HI>viz.</HI> To do every thing

that lay in her Power to procure the Peace and Pro&s;perity of her People, &s;e|cured her Royal Character from the In|famy of tho&s;e Reproaches, and People could not ea&s;ily entertain the Thoughts of their Sovereign, which the&s;e In&s;inua|tions lead them too; yet there were not the &s;ame Rea&s;ons to move us not to be|lieve, that the&s;e Men had it not in their De&s;ign. On the other Hand, Many Peo|ple thought they had good Rea&s;on to &s;ay, <HI>That if the Queen was not really in the De&s;ign of the&s;e Men, and was not con|&s;enting to Mea&s;ures fatal to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, it was not their Faults, nor for want of frequent Attempts, on their Side, to bring it to pa&s;s; and though they were not yet arriv'd to that Height, as to own their De&s;ign to her Maje&s;ty, yet a Genius of very little Penetration might &s;ee, they were not &s;o remote to it as they pre|tended to be.</HI></P>
<P>But they had Fore&s;ight enough to per|ceive that things were not ripe for Exe|cution; That they could not declare them|&s;elves upon the main Point till &s;ome Ob|&s;tacles were remov'd. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous of the&s;e was the <HI>White-Staff;</HI> They had in vain taken all the Ways po&s;&s;ible, not to try whether he was in

<P>How this was done, and how far it has tended to the Honour of the <HI>Staff,</HI> to the Vindication of his Character a|mong the Lovers of the Con&s;titution, and how &s;ea&s;onably to detect the Faction who&punc; brought it to pa&s;s, will appear in the Sequel of the Story.</P>
<P>It was matter of &s;urprize to all People, who knew no more of things than what
<PB N="47" REF="47">
was to be &s;een without doors, to find a &s;udden Breach among the Managers of publick Affairs, and the Mini&s;try divided into Two Parties. The Whigs were &s;o far from entering into the Notion of it, that their fir&s;t Opinions of it amounted to no more than this, That it was all a <HI>Feint</HI> or a <HI>Bite</HI> as they call'd it, and that it was a concerted &s;tate Juggle between the Courtiers, to carry on &s;ome De&s;ign which the <HI>Staff</HI> had in hand.</P>
<P>They were a little puzzled indeed, and at a lo&s;s in that Opinion, when they found that the high Party began gene|rally to form them&s;elves, that all their Di&s;cour&s;es, they began to decry the Con|duct of the <HI>Staff,</HI> Cry up the Capacity and Genius of the <HI>Great Seal,</HI> and of &s;ome other managing Heads which were apparently acting in Conjunction with him; and this was further encrea&s;ed, when they found this Language began to be &s;poken within the Walls of St. <HI>James</HI>'s and <HI>Ren&mdash;ton,</HI> and that the <HI>Staff</HI> began to be treated with le&s;s Con|fidence, and receiv'd with le&s;s Di&s;tin|ction there than he was wont to be; That the ri&s;ing Sun &s;eem'd to be plac'd upon another Head, and that Dependants be|gan to make their Court another way.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48">
By degrees the&s;e things began to con|vince People that the thing was no Je&s;t, That there was an Intere&s;t forming again&s;t the <HI>Staff,</HI> and that it was not without &s;ome probability that it was likely to be powerful enough to prevail.</P>
<P>Nor was it difficult to gue&s;s at the Rea|&s;on of the Breach, when the People who had formed the Intere&s;t began to be better known.</P>
<P>All this while, the <HI>Staff,</HI> who &s;eem'd unconcern'd at all their Mea&s;ures, was too vigilant not to penetrate into their De&s;igns; and being fully Ma&s;ter, not only of what Steps they were taking again&s;t him&s;elf, but of what they aim'd at beyond him, and why they found it nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to remove him, was not &s;o much wanting to his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, as not to lay before her the whole Pro|ject.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay that he had altogether the &s;ucce&s;s in prevailing upon her belief of the latent particulars, as was u&s;ual to him in things le&s;s concerning him&s;elf, or that the Relation made that impre&s;&s;ion at fir&s;t that the right of the thing might require; and if it was &s;o, it is ea&s;y to &s;ay what In&s;inuations that part might be owing to: But the <HI>Staff</HI> unconcern'd at
<PB N="49" REF="49">
the Event, perform'd this Part as a Du|ty to the Queen, and a Di&s;charge of that great Tru&s;t which had been repos'd in him formerly; and &s;eeing, with Concern, what Impre&s;&s;ions had been made another way, he contented him&s;elf with having di&s;charg'd that Duty, contemning all that which Politicians call Self-Pre&s;er|vation, and <HI>Entirely Neglecting</HI> the Party he let them go on, well knowing that if they had the greate&s;t Succe&s;s they expected, yet their own Mea&s;ures would at la&s;t overthrow them; and that, &s;eeing he could not prevail with them to be wi&s;er for them&s;elves, every Step they prevail|ed again&s;t him would, in the end, be his Safety and Advantage; &s;ince it would on all Occa&s;ions appear, that he had drawn out from them, and &s;acrificed his Safety and Intere&s;t, meerly becau&s;e he would not come into Wea&s;ures ruinous to his Country, and to the Intere&s;t of his So|veraign.</P>
<P>It needs not that I &s;hould enter here upon a Di&s;cour&s;e of the Duty of States-Men, and how they ought to think them|&s;elves obliged always to regard the In|tere&s;t and Safety of their Country; to make it &s;uperiour in their Aims to the mo&s;t advantageous Pro&s;pects, or the great|e&s;t

of their De&s;igns, and in Ca&s;es of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity to &s;acrifice their Ambition, and even their Lawful Hopes to the Publick Good; or that, having phylo&s;ophis'd upon this Subject, I &s;hould enter by way of Panegyrick to &s;et down how far the Conduct of the <HI>Staff</HI> appears to have been grounded upon this ju&s;t Principle; I am not at Lea&s;ure now to do the Per|&s;onal Character of the <HI>Staff</HI> the Ju&s;tice the&s;e Things call for; Po&s;terity will ac|knowledge it to him when, if the Facts being but impartially &s;tated, they &s;hall &s;ee how much they owe to this parti|cular Tran&s;action, the effectual Di&s;ap|pointment of all the Schemes which were then laid for the Ruin of our Liberties, Religion and Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>To return therefore to our Hi&s;tory, We found that the <HI>Staff,</HI> having left the&s;e Men to act upon their own imaginary Schemes, and they having now, as it were, the full Liberty they de|&s;ired, they fail'd not to make u&s;e of it with the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance imaginable; pur&s;uing their fir&s;t De&s;ign to &s;up|plant him effectually in his Intere&s;t with the Queen. To this Purpo&s;e they pro|cured &s;everal Things to be demanded of him in the Execution of his Office, which
<PB N="51" REF="51">
as <HI>Staff,</HI> they knew he could not comply with, and which they were &s;atisfy'd he would excu&s;e him&s;elf from doing; to which Excu&s;es it lay on them to give the mo&s;t ma|licious Con&s;truction that they were able, and which, by the Artifices of &s;ome Fe|males, who had too many Obligations to the <HI>Staff</HI> to make &s;uch Management very honourable, they ea&s;ily found Means to do. Nor perhaps would tho&s;e very People have been the la&s;t to have charg'd him with Mi&s;applications, if he had comply'd with their Demands, or if he had fail'd, with Plainne&s;s and Re&s;olution, to repre&s;ent the Nece&s;&s;ity he was under to refu&s;e that Obe|dience, which, in other Ca&s;es, he was ready to give without any Re&s;erve to the Or|ders and Commands of his Soveraign.</P>
<P>There was nothing &s;o malicious and unju&s;t as the In&s;inuations, which the Agents of this Faction made upon the Occa&s;ion afore&s;aid; not failing to repre|&s;ent every thing as much to the Di&s;advan|tage of the <HI>Staff</HI> as it was po&s;&s;ible; &s;ugge&s;t|ing that he exerci&s;ed his Power with the &s;ame, or a greater arbitrary Haughtine&s;s than that which he had alledg'd upon his Predece&s;&s;or. That while he pretended the pre&s;erving Liberty, he him&s;elf acted with un&s;ufferable Tyranny. That not content
<PB N="52" REF="52">
to exerci&s;e this Temper towards the Sub|ject, he now began to oppo&s;e him&s;elf to the Queen al&s;o; to di&s;pute her Ma|je&s;ty's Commands, and to ob&s;truct her Favours, if he found them directed to Per&s;ons who he thought fit to pique in private Matters. That in publick Affairs, he carried on an Intere&s;t with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> di&s;honourble to, becau&s;e without the Knowledge of her Maje&s;ty; That he &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in the good Graces of the Succe&s;&s;our at her Ma|je&s;ty's Expence, and at the Expence of the Honour of the Throne, and the like.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were believ'd, it is not to be wondred at, if &s;ome Di&s;&s;ati&s;|factions began to take place to the Pre|judice of the Intere&s;t of the <HI>White-&s;taff,</HI> which albeit he was not in&s;en&s;ible of, yet he too plainly &s;aw that they were not ea&s;ily to be remov'd, unle&s;s he &s;ubmit|ted to a Faction, who he was &s;atisfy'd were embark'd in a premeditated De&s;ign to de&s;troy and betray their Soveraign wherefore he re&s;olv'd to re&s;erve him&s;elf as before for better Times, and to wait an Occa&s;ion when he might open he Maje&s;ty's Eyes to the De&s;ign that was i$ hand, and detect the Schemes of the&s; Men, not to her Maje&s;ty only, but t the whole Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="53">
The &s;aid Faction having thus an unin|terrupted Freedom of acting, it was no hard matter to carry on their Scheme, and, as they improv'd the Occa&s;ion with the greate&s;t Diligence, it was not long before they found means to let the <HI>Staff</HI> know, that it would be taken kindly if he would re&s;ign. But the <HI>Staff</HI> re&s;olving to put them upon more openly di&s;cover|ing them&s;elves, waited as though he had not under&s;tood tho&s;e Hints, continued to execute the Duty of his place with all the Tranquillity and Compo&s;ure of Mind, as if he had not the lea&s;t Notion of being remov'd, and thereby oblig'd them to go nearer the forcible Point than they de&s;ign'd to do.</P>
<P>There being then no other Method, they were at length oblig'd to let him know, that it was her Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure he &s;hould re&s;ign, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nothing was ever acted with more Temper and Gravity, and yet with an undepre&s;s'd Gallantry of Spirit, than the <HI>Staff</HI> acted this la&s;t Scene, when putting into the Queen's hands the En&s;ign of Office, he chearfully removed from the highe&s;t Station of Honour and Power, next to the Soveraign, into that be&s;t and noble&s;t Po&s;t of Honour, A Private Station.

He reckon'd up the &s;everal Exigences they had, by their precipitant Councils, brought things to in their former Ma|nagement, the Scandal of which lay on him; and how often he had extricated them out of tho&s;e Dilemma's, when they were ready to de&s;ert both their Country and them&s;elves for fear of Publick Ju&s;tice. He prophetickly told them how, they would be, in a little while, reduced to the primitive State of Meanne&s;s and Con|tempt in which he found them, and from which her Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s had rais'd them at his Interce&s;&s;ion: Concluding, That he was no Enemy to their Per&s;ons, but was very &s;orry he was obliged to be &s;o to their Mea&s;ures; That he had too long born the Reproaches which was due to tho&s;e Mea&s;ures which he had in vain per&s;waded them again&s;t, and that it was time now that the World &s;hould &s;ee who were the Enemies to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> E&s;ta|bli&s;hment; and that the Nation &s;hould direct their Re&s;entments where the Guilt, which they &s;uppos'd de&s;erv'd it, lay; and &s;hould know the Authors of their Un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es from tho&s;e who had heartily &s;truggled to prevent them. He told them, if they had been Capable of any Modera|tion in their Succe&s;s, they had obtain'd
<PB N="60" REF="60">
as much Victory over the Party who oppo&s;ed them, as any <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject ought de&s;ire over another: That they ought to di&s;tingui&s;h between a War of Parties, where the End is only to pre|&s;erve them&s;elves in the Admini&s;tration, and a War with a Forreign Nation, where the End is Conque&s;t and Ruin. That the way to pre&s;erve the Advantages they had obtain'd, had been by exerting them|&s;elves in the Intere&s;t and Service of their Country, to make her Maje&s;ty's Reign happy and ea&s;y to the People, and by all the Steps of Prudence, Ju&s;tice, Cle|mency, and Tenderne&s;s, Things which they knew her Maje&s;ty delighted in, have recommended the Admini&s;tration, and convinc'd the People that the Calumnie rai&s;ed on them had been fal&s;e and &s;lan+derous, and &s;o have reconciled the Na+tion to them, by the real Merit of thei well managing the publick Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> He appealed to them, if th had not been the Doctrine that he ha always preached to them, and if he ha not frequently told them, that the would bring the whole Nation up$ them by their contrary Behaviour? $ concluded all by challenging them ope+ly, if there was any Corruption in $

hands, to bring him to the &s;evere&s;t Tryal. He told them if he had enriched his Fa|mily by engro&s;s'd Favours, &s;ecured to him&s;elf Gifts or Grants, rai&s;ed his Sub|&s;tance by the Plunder of his Country; or if any Embezlements or Mi&s;applica|tions were to be found with him, that he de&s;ired they would Charge him, and that her Maje&s;ty might &s;hew him no Favour.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things, and many more to this purpo&s;e, as I am inform'd, were &s;aid on this Occa&s;ion; when no Reply being made, he di&s;mi&s;s'd him&s;elf from publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and delivered him&s;elf from the Odium of other Men's Errors, and the <HI>White-Staff</HI> remain'd for &s;ome Days in a State of Non-exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon perceived that this Di&s;|cour&s;e had made deeper Impre&s;&s;ions, in the Brea&s;t that was imediately concern'd in it, than was imagined; we may not &s;ay that the &s;udden and dreadful Stroke which, in a very few Days, or perhaps Hours after, fell upon her Maje&s;ty's Per|&s;on, who&s;e Lo&s;s no Happine&s;s, or Sence of the Happine&s;s in her Glorious Succe&s;&s;or, forbids us to mourn for, was occa&s;ion'd by this Incident; leaving that to the Skill of tho&s;e who, prying into the Rea|&s;ons
<PB N="62" REF="62">
and Cau&s;es of her Maje&s;ty's Di&s;tem|per upon the Di&s;&s;ection of the Royal Corps, told us, That all the nobler Parts were &s;ound and perfect, &s;uited to a long Life and good Con&s;titution, but that &s;omething which affected her Heart was &s;uppo&s;ed to occa&s;ion her Death; if this be &s;o, it remains for tho&s;e Men to lay it to Heart, and con&s;ider how far they con|tributed to that fatal Blow, and might be In&s;truments in the hand of &s;econd Cau&s;es to &s;horten that Life, of which they had &s;uch Obligations on them to be tender.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, It was not many days e'er we &s;aw her Maje&s;ty di&s;po&s;e of the <HI>Staff</HI> from them, and place it in a hand which they had as little Aprehen&s;ions of as Inclination to: Nothing could have been a greater Surprize to them than this Step which her Maje&s;ty took, and as they were never famous for Pre&s;ence of Aeind in the Article of a Surpri&s;e, it was no won|der to &s;ee them in an A&s;toni&s;hment, that dive&s;ted them of all Power to take proper Mea&s;ures for their future Conduct, or in the lea&s;t manner to conceal their Di&s;or|der: We are told &s;ome of them had the A&s;&s;urance to ask her Aeaje&s;ty <HI>if &s;he knew what &s;he did?</HI> To which her Maje&s;ty gave &s;uch an An&s;wer as they de&s;erved, and as

very well expre&s;s'd the ju&s;t Indignation &s;he conceiv'd at their Conduct, as well as her Re&s;entment at &s;o in&s;olent a Que|&s;tion; but as this Part is but a Report, it admits of no further Di&s;cour&s;e at this time.</P>
<P>The Tragical Part of this Hi&s;tory has prevented the Di&s;covery of what Steps the late <HI>Staff,</HI> for &s;o we mu&s;t now &s;peak of him, had made to overthrow the Mea|&s;ures of the&s;e People. The Glory of our Nation &s;unk unhappily under the Weight of this Breach, the Head of Government being &s;truck with Death a few Moments after what has already been related was tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>This Tract &s;hall no farther inquire in|to the melancholly Part, <HI>viz.</HI> How much the Di&s;turbance, the&s;e things were to her Maje&s;ty, gave any A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Di|&s;temper which &s;eized her &s;o violently, or ha&s;tened her Death; Nor has it any Re|lation to the De&s;ign in hand: But one Thing cannot pa&s;s our Ob&s;ervation, be|cau&s;e it tends to undeceiving the People in what they &s;eem very Confident of.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>Common Place,</HI> or General Di&s;cour&s;e and Opinion of many People, That had the Queen lived a few Months longer, we &s;hould have been all inevita|bly
<PB N="64" REF="64">
given over to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and the Schemes for bringing him in had been &s;o Effectually laid, that either the Queen her &s;elf &s;hould involuntarily have been made the In&s;trument of her own Ruin, and that of her Peoples, or to have been utterly unable to prevent it.</P>
<P>This is become now &s;o general an Opi|nion, that nothing can per&s;wade &s;ome People to believe otherwi&s;e, whereas the true <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory</HI> of that Part looks quite another way, and in &s;hort is this: That had her Maje&s;ty lived Two Months longer, &s;he had with her own hands, <HI>by the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance</HI> of the late <HI>Staff,</HI> with whom no doubt the pre&s;ent <HI>Staff</HI> would gladly have con|curr'd in &s;o Glorious a work, I &s;ay, her Maje&s;ty had with her own hands over|thrown all the wicked Schemes tho&s;e Men had laid, and which &s;he was already made &s;en&s;ible were De&s;tructive to her real In|tere&s;t, and the Peace of her Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The Time was &s;o &s;hort, her Maje&s;ty's Di&s;temper &s;o violent, and her Death &s;o very &s;uddain, that there was no Room for many Particulars of this Part to appear; But one happy Circum&s;tance leaves &s;uch a Con|viction of the Truth of this, on the Minds of all that will impartially con&s;ider the&s;e Things, that no one can with&s;tand it.
<PB N="65" REF="65">
Can it be Rational to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e Men had no De&s;ign to &s;ecure the <HI>Staff</HI> in their own hands? OR, <HI>On the other hand,</HI> will any Man be &s;o weak as to think that the pre&s;ent <HI>Staff</HI> was the Per&s;on they de|&s;ign'd? What then could move her late Maje&s;ty to take a Step &s;o contrary to, and in it &s;elf &s;o de&s;tructive of, all their Mea&s;ures, if her Maje&s;ty had been, as is &s;ugge&s;ted, either in their Mea&s;ures, or under their Management.</P>
<P>And if her Maje&s;ty, who was at fir&s;t &s;o far &s;atisfy'd with them, and had &s;o good an Opinion of their Integrity, as at their Motion to di&s;place the late <HI>Staff</HI> who had always been &s;o fa&s;t riveted in her Favour, as not to be &s;haken by the &s;tronge&s;t Efforts of a Former Party, had not been altered in her Opinion of them, and had not &s;een Rea&s;on to be le&s;s &s;atisfied with them than &s;he was before, Why did &s;he give the <HI>Staff</HI> from them? and, Why did &s;he give it into a Hand that was never in their Intere&s;t, and but little in their Favour; a Hand whom they fear'd and hated as much as they did the former, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That they knew he would not ri&s;que his Country to rai&s;e a Party, and to gratify private Ambition?</P>
<P>Nor was it a &s;mall Progre&s;s for the late
<PB N="66" REF="66">
<HI>Staff</HI> to make in Two Days time after his being di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, <HI>viz.</HI> To convince the Queen &s;he was gotten into hands not fit to be tru&s;ted, and to obtain of her Maje&s;ty to put her &s;elf into the hands of a Per&s;on who&s;e Probity, Wi&s;dom, Affecti|on to her Per&s;on, and Concern for his Country, was too well known to be doubted, and too great to be tainted with the Corruption of a Mercenary Party.</P>
<P>This Step of her Maje&s;ty was to the New Faction a Stumbling at the Thre&s;hold, and Effectually di&s;concerted all their Mea|&s;ures, enervated the Force of their Party, and di&s;abled them Entirely for the Mi&s;|chief they had de&s;ign'd; For what could they do without the <HI>Staff?</HI> And what could not the <HI>Staff</HI> do without them?</P>
<P>The Queen was then acting with her Eyes open, nor was it in their Power to clo&s;e them, and had not Death clo&s;ed them as it did, they had in a few Days been the mo&s;t expo&s;ed, and mo&s;t con|temptible Party of Men in the Nation; and perhaps had not e&s;caped without &s;ome Ta&s;te of that Re&s;entment, which her Maje&s;ty in Ju&s;tice could hardly have forborn to a Set of Men, who, under the greate&s;t Obligations to her Bounty, and
<PB N="67" REF="67">
with the greate&s;t Pretences to render her Service, were running her into inextri|cable Difficulties, Betraying her Per&s;on, Crown and Kingdoms, and building their private Fortunes upon her inevitable De&s;truction.</P>
<P>But her Maje&s;ty was &s;natch'd away, and Heaven has taken this work into his own hands, the wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;als of Pro|vidence are always to be &s;ubmitted to, and the Mercy of Heaven in &s;o Peaceably filling up the Throne with the only Rightful and Lawful Succe&s;&s;or, is never to be enough acknowledg'd; Nothing but which could have repair'd the Lo&s;s, or made up the Breach which her Ma|je&s;ty's &s;uddain Death had made among us. The only Misfortune attending the New Admini&s;tration, <HI>if any thing can le&s;&s;en our Joy on this Occa&s;ion,</HI> is, That the&s;e Men are not &s;o fully and effectually de|tected and expo&s;ed, or the Honour of her Maje&s;ty &s;o effectually vindicated in this Affair of the Pretender, as would have been the Ca&s;e had Her Life been &s;pared a little longer; But Time will do Ju&s;tice to her Memory.</P>
<P>Had her Maje&s;ty liv'd till this Di&s;co|very had been made, no Man would then have offer'd to &s;ugge&s;t, That the Queen
<PB N="68" REF="68">
was engaged with tho&s;e Men in the wicked De&s;ign of ruining their Countries Liberties, &s;elling us to <HI>French, Popi&s;h,</HI> or any other Slavery; and it would have been Con&s;picuous to the whole Nation, that the late <HI>Staff</HI> had re&s;cued both the Queen, and her Kingdoms al&s;o, from the Danger that hung over their Heads, by fully acquainting her Maje&s;ty with the De&s;igns, and with the Men, and leading her by the hand to a clear View of the Gulph they were going to &s;ink her into.</P>
<P>Thus far our Secret Hi&s;tory goes upon the Facts which have appeared, The Con|&s;equences which may be drawn from the Premi&s;es are too many to be enlarged up|on; What the&s;e Men have been driving at is evident, and what had been their Fate if the Queen had &s;urvived a Few Months longer is very plain: It is hoped, That as the&s;e things cannot be hid from the Knowledge of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, &s;o neither will it be long e'er tho&s;e, who were &s;o apparently embark'd in De&s;igns de&s;tructive to the Safety and Liberty of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from tho&s;e who have been unju&s;tly loaden with their Guilt, and been reproach'd with tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs which they have been the only Means to prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="69">
Above all, The A&s;hes of her Late Ma|je&s;ty &s;eems to call upon the pre&s;ent Age to clear up her Memory from that Ca|lumny which, as above, is rai&s;ed from the &s;uppo&s;ed Influence the&s;e &s;candalous Per&s;ons &s;eem'd to have upon her Inten|tions; as if, becau&s;e they prevail'd with her Maje&s;ty to di&s;place the <HI>Staff,</HI> who had had &s;o long and &s;o uninterrupted a Share in her particular Favour, that therefore they had a full A&s;&s;cendant over the Queen's Re&s;olutions, and that her Ma|je&s;ty was to be entituled to all the Scan|dal of their Conduct; That it was in their Power to give up the Nation to <HI>France,</HI> To introduce the Pretender, Suppre&s;s our Liberties, and, in a word, To ruin the Nation.</P>
<P>Which was &s;o far from being True, That, as is manife&s;t, it was not in their Power to keep the <HI>Staff</HI> within their own Party, or to influence her Maje&s;ty to di&s;po&s;e of it to any of their Friends; nay, nor to prevent its being di&s;po&s;ed, <HI>as is &s;aid,</HI> where it was even a greater Terror than it was before.</P>
<P>It cannot be imagin'd, That her Ma|je&s;ty, who was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their being Enemies to her Safety, and to the Tran|quility of her Kingdoms, as not to think
<PB N="70" REF="70">
fit to tru&s;t them with the <HI>Staff,</HI> was &s;o clo&s;ely joined with them in their other Mea&s;ures, as to give up Her&s;elf and Go|vernment to the only profe&s;t Enemy of both, and to be &s;old to the Pretender: It is more than probable, that her Eyes were opened to the Treachery of the&s;e Men, That &s;he had found the Account given her of them by the late <HI>Staff</HI> unde|niably proved, their Knavery detected, and was convinced, that they were not Per&s;ons &s;he could commit her &s;elf, or the Nation to with Safety, and that there|fore, even at that Juncture, when they thought the Game their own, her Ma|je&s;ty gave them to under&s;tand, that &s;he was re&s;olved to be Mi&s;tre&s;s of her own Mea&s;ures, and to Reign without them.</P>
<P>It would make up another Volume, and be a Secret Hi&s;tory as full of Variety as this, and full as Entertaining, to give an Account, How Planet-&s;truck they ap|peared at this &s;urprizing Blow; What they &s;aid one to another after they had &s;tood looking one upon another &s;peech|le&s;s and confounded for &s;ome Hours; at a private A&s;&s;embly of all their Confe|derates, which was held upon the Occa|&s;ion, where they gave Vent to their Pa&s;&s;ions, and broke out into all the Ex|travagancies
