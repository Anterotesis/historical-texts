<P N="1">I. THERE liv'd a King in the land of <HI>Britain,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;ame was a bad Prince, and he did that which was Evil in the Sight of the Lord; he &s;tarted a&s;ide lik a crooked Bow, and obey'd not the Commandments of his God.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="4">
III. But went a whoring after &s;trange Gods, even the Works of Mens Hands; he &s;et up Images in the Tabernacles, and bended his knee before them, defiling thereby the Temple of the mo&s;t High.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Morover, he oppre&s;&s;ed the People, he laid heavy Burdens upon their Backs, and prepar'd a Yoke to gaul the Necks of the Righteous.</P>
<P N="5">V. He had no Son to inherit the Land, but yielding to the Devices of <HI>JEZEBEL</HI> his Queen; he con&s;ented to all &s;he did, and own'd a &s;purious I&s;&s;ue to be his Legitimate Heir, and call'd his Name <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. This provoked the anger of the Lord; and He &s;tirr'd up a Prince again&s;t him, who &s;hou'd &s;poil him of all his Lands.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Now it came to pa&s;s, that Prince <HI>WILLIAM</HI> having e&s;pous'd <HI>MARY,</HI> the elde&s;t Daughter of <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. That the chief of the Nobility and Gentry &s;ent unto him, and &s;aid,</P>

<P N="10">X. Whereupon he pre&s;ently aro&s;e, and gather'd unto him certain of his Ho&s;t, and &s;aid unto them;</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="7" REF="5">
XI. Let us help tho&s;e who are in Di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;hake of the Bonds of tho&s;e who are in Captivity, and re&s;tore the true Wor&s;hip of the Lord.</P>
<P N="12">XII And he pa&s;s'd over into the Land of <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> and came into the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Part thereof, and there were daily gathered unto him &s;uch as &s;hould be SAVED</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Moreover, he put forth a Decla|ration, &s;aying, <HI>I come not to conquer the Kingdom, but to re&s;tore the true Wor&s;hip of the God of our Fore-fathers.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV And the People ca&s;t up their Hats, and &s;houted for Joy, and crying aloud, &s;aid,</P>
<P N="15">XV. <HI>This is a ble&s;&s;ed Day, we will re|joyce and be merry in it.</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. NOW, when the&s;e Tidings were brought unto <HI>JAMES</HI> the King, who was then at Dinner;</P>
<P N="17">XVII. He aro&s;e from his Chair, and &s;tand|ing up, &s;aid unto tho&s;e who were round a|bout him, <HI>What &s;hall we</HI> do?</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. And then he &s;at down again, and fill'd his Belly, and it is recorded he was a great Eater;</P>
<P N="19">XIX. And his chief Coun&s;ellors &s;aid un|to him, <HI>Let us go forth unto Battle,</HI></P>
<P N="20">XX. And he &s;aid, <HI>We will go forth;</HI> but his Heart fail'd him.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="8" REF="6">
XXI HOWBEIT, in a few Days, he call'd unto him certain of the Chieftains, and Men of War.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. And he &s;poke unto them &s;aying,</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. <HI>Let us make ready for Battle, and go forth to meet tho&s;e who &s;hall oppo&s;e us.</HI></P>
<P N="24">XXIV. And they march'd towards the Plains of <HI>SALISBURY.</HI></P>
<P N="25">XXV. And, behold, as he &s;lept, he &s;aw a Vi&s;ion; and lo$ an old Man cloath'd in white Arrayment, appear'd before him, and &s;aid, <HI>Return, for the Lord is not with thee.</HI></P>
<P N="26">XXVI. <HI>From this Day the Kingdom is rent from thee, and given unto another: even unto a Prince thy Kin&s;man, who &s;erveth the Lord in Spirit, and in Truth.</HI></P>

<P N="1">I. VVHen the King awoke, he was &s;ore troubled in mind.</P>
<P N="2">II. And having Eaten and Drunken plen|tifully, he &s;aid unto tho&s;e who were near him,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>I have &s;een a Vi&s;ion, and it plea&s;|eth me not; I will, therefore, ari&s;e, and re|turn unto the Place from whence I came, for I will tarry here no longer.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="9" REF="7">
IV: And he 'ro&s;e up, and returned unto his Palace.</P>
<P N="5">V, <HI>Now</HI> he tarried but a &s;hort Space be|fore he &s;ent away his Queen <HI>Jezebel,</HI> and his &s;uppo&s;ed Son <HI>James</HI> unto a Neighbouring King.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And he him&s;elf retired to another Part of his Dominions, called <HI>Hibernia.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Now it came to pa&s;s, That Prince <HI>William</HI> marched toward the Capital City of <HI>Britain;</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. And the chief Rulers and Elders of the Kingdom being a&s;&s;embled together, did Vote and Con&s;ent, that the Prince and his Spou&s;e <HI>Mary</HI> &s;hould be King and Queen thereof.</P>
<P N="9">IX. And they were annointed by the High Prie&s;t in the mid&s;t of all the Cong|regation, and the Oil ran down even unto the Skirts of their Cloathing.</P>
<P N="10">X. And they did that which was Righte|ous in the Sight of the Lord, and turned out tho&s;e who had defiled the Temple.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <HI>JAMES</HI> being come into the King|dom of <HI>Hibernia,</HI> did gather unto him Thou&s;ands and Ten Thou&s;ands of &s;uch who had drank with him of the Cup of A|bomination.</P>
<P N="2">II. And he tru&s;ted unto the Multitude of his Ho&s;t, unto his Pike-men, and his Hor&s;e|men, and divided them into Troops, and in|to Companies, of Fifties, and of Hundreds, and placed Captains over them.</P>
<P N="3">III. And he &s;aid unto them, <HI>Go ye forth into the North|part of the Kingdom, and de&s;troy all tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;tand before ye.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. And they did as their Ma&s;ter com|manded them; For they &s;pared neither Male nor Female, neither had they any Regard unto the Cries of the Widows and the Or|phans.</P>
<P N="5">V. Now, when the&s;e things came unto the Ears of the Children of <HI>Inniskelling,</HI> they armed them&s;elves, and &s;aid.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>We will fight the Battle of the Lord; It is better to fall by the Sword, than to fall into the Hands of the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. And howbeit, they were but an Handful, yet they annoyed the Camp of heir Enemies, and &s;lew many of them.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="11" REF="9">
VIII. But the Number of the Wicked increa&s;ed, and the Children of <HI>Inneskilling</HI> were put to Flight, and they fled unto the City of <HI>Derry,</HI> and entered in at the Gates thereof.</P>
<P N="9">IX. And the Ho&s;t of the Wicked follow|ed after them, and came and pitched their Tents before the Walls of the City.</P>
<P N="10">X. And they &s;ummoned them to &s;urrender &s;aying, <HI>Yield ye your &s;elves Pri&s;oners, while it is yet well with ye,</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. But they an&s;wered with one Accord, <HI>We will not yield.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. So the City was be&s;ieged, and every Thing was very dear therein, for there was a Famine among them.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. In&s;omuch, that a Dog's Head was &s;old for half a Crown, and a Rat for &s;ix|pence.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. And &s;ome of the People began to murmure. and cry, <HI>Let us open the Gates, and yield unto them who are encamped again&s;t us, for there is plenty of good things among them.</HI></P>
<P N="15">XV. Then &s;tood up the Governour who was al&s;o one of the Prie&s;ts of the Temple, and &s;aid,</P>
<P N="16">XVI. <HI>Men and Brethren, know ye not</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<HI>that we have a Saying, which is handed down unto us from our Forefathers, who them&s;elves received it from the Mouth of the Godly;</HI></P>

<P N="19">XIX. And they An&s;wered and &s;aid,</P>
<P N="20">XX. <HI>We will not dwell in the Tents of the Ungodly, neither will we have Communion with the Wicked</HI></P>
<P N="20">XX. And from thence forward they liv'd together as Brethren, and tru&s;ted in the Lord their God to &s;ave them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. NOW, when the&s;e Tidings were brought unto King <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> he &s;aid,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Let us go forth and A&s;&s;i&s;tour Brethren, for they are of the Hou&s;hold of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. And he made him&s;elf ready, and pa&s;s'd over into the <HI>North-part</HI> of <HI>HIBERNIA,</HI> and Landed at a Town call'd <HI>CARICK|FERGUS.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. But &s;uch was the Care and Vigilance
<PB N="13" REF="11">
of the good King, that he &s;ent before him a Ship well &s;tor'd with all Things nece&s;&s;ary for the Relief of the City of <HI>DERRY.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. And &s;he &s;ail'd into the Mouth of the River; but there was a Boom laid cro&s;s the &s;ame, &s;o that &s;he cou'd not come near.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And they, who were in the City, ima|gin'd that the Ship did belong unto the E|nemy, and that &s;he was &s;ent to Attack them by Sea:</P>
<P N="7">VII. Therefore, they fir'd their Cannon again&s;t her, and did Damage unto her;</P>
<P N="8">VIII. But at length they perceiv'd &s;he was their Friend, and &s;he broke the Boom, and came into the Harbour of the City;</P>
<P N="9">IX. And they rejoic'd exceedingly, and were glad; giving Thanks for &s;uch timely Succour.</P>
<P N="10">X. But when the Wicked had heard, what good Things had happen'd unto tho&s;e who were in the City, they were a&s;toni&s;h'd:</P>
<P N="11">XI. And they &s;truck their Tents, and fled (like a Thief) in the Night, and ha&s;ten'd unto their Ma&s;ter <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. In the Morning, when they, who defended the City, intended to have &s;alli'd forth.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. They perceiv'd that their Enemies were gone; and there was no more of them.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="14" REF="12">
XIV. They con&s;ulted, therefore, among them&s;elves, what was mo&s;t proper to be done</P>
<P N="15">XV. And they tarry'd a while in the City and repair'd the Breaches and Damages there of, and took Care of &s;uch as were Sick and Wounded.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. And they left a good Gari&s;on there in, and furni&s;h'd it with all Things which were requi&s;ite for its Defence, and marched to join King <HI>WILLIAM.</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. And fora&s;much as there had been many <HI>Londoners</HI> among them, and by Rea|&s;on that all who were therein, acquitted them&s;elves like Men.</P>

<P N="2">II. But as he came near unto the Town of <HI>Drougheda,</HI> he perceiv'd that the Ene|mies of the Lord were encamp'd on the o|ther &s;ide of the River, which is call'd the <HI>BOYN.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="13">
III. And having held a Council of WAR, it was re&s;olv'd, that the Army &s;hou'd cro&s;s over (if po&s;&s;ible) and drive the Enemy from their Entrenchments.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Now it came to pa&s;s, that &s;ome of the Men had found a Place which was ford|able.</P>
<P N="5">V. And as King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> was put|ting his Men in ARRAY, the Enemy fir'd again&s;t him, and a Bullet graz'd upon his Shoulder;</P>
<P N="6">VI. Whereupon it was &s;traitway rumour|ed, the King was killed.</P>
<P N="7">VII. This alarm'd all the Ho&s;t, in&s;omuch that many of their Hearts fail'd them, and their Countenances fell.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. But the good King hearing there|of, &s;hew'd him&s;elf among them; and pulling off his Hat, &s;aid, <HI>I am but &s;lightly wounded.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. Then the Hor&s;emen pa&s;s'd over the River, and drove the Enemy from their Trenches.</P>
<P N="10">X. As &s;oon as <HI>JAMES</HI> &s;aw what they were doing, he call'd his Men about him, and &s;aid.</P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>Behold the undaunted Spirit of Eng|li&s;h-Men, who&s;e Bellies being fill'd with Beef, and their Stomachs with Pudding, will &s;lay e|very one of ye, except ye provide for your &s;elves.</HI></P>

<PB N="16" REF="14">
<HI>me, for I will tarry no longer here.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. And Fear came upon them all: And they fled, albeit, they were by Thou&s;|ands more in Number than the Servants of the Lord.</P>

<P N="2">II. <HI>Let us, I pray thee remove from hence, and go into another Country;</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>But before we depart, we will &s;et Fire to this City, and lock up the Gates thereof, and then burn all the</HI> Prote&s;tants <HI>therein.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The Wrath of <HI>JAMES</HI> was kindl'd at this, and he would not con&s;ent un|to it, but &s;aid,</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>I have been too wicked already and vio|lated my Oath, provoking thereby the Judg|ment of Heaven;</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>And &s;hall I add Murder to my Breach of Faith? Who is he that advi&s;eth me &s;o to do?</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Thus the City was &s;av'd, and <HI>JAMES</HI> fled unto the King of the <HI>GAULS,</HI> from whom he crav'd A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P N="10">X. For he was infatuated, and bewitch|ed with her Sorceries, and could not get out of the Pit into which &s;he had drawn him.</P>
<P N="11">XI. And by him the Scripture was fulfil|led, &s;aying, <HI>A Whore is a deep Ditch, and he who is abhorr'l of the Lord &s;hall fall therein.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. Now King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> had re|duced to Obedience the Major part of the Kingdom of <HI>HIBERNIA;</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. But the City of <HI>LIMMERICK</HI> held out again&s;t him, and it was be&s;ieg'd, and taken at la&s;t by Capitulation.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. He fought the Battle at <HI>AUGH|RIM,</HI> in which the <HI>French</HI> General, who was called St. <HI>RUTH,</HI> was kill'd with a Can|non Ball.</P>
<P N="15">XV. And he di&s;comfited them, and put them to Flight; and leaving the Kingdom in Peace, appointed Governors over it; and returned to <HI>LONDON,</HI> which is the Me|tropolis of <HI>GREAT-BRITAIN.</HI></P>

<P N="3">III. And they drew their Armies forth, and the Seat of the War was in <HI>FLAN|DERS.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. About this Time dy'd Queen <HI>MA|RY;</HI> and there were Lamentations and Mournings for her in all Parts of the King|dom, for &s;he was belov'd of her Subjects, and had done that which was Righteous in the Sight of the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">V. However, the War was carry'd on, Battles were fought, and Towns were tak|en; and they, who were &s;lain, were many in Number.</P>
<P N="6">VI. At length, the King of the <HI>GAULS</HI> $u'd for Peace, which was granted him; and it was call'd the Peace of <HI>RESWICK.</HI></P>

<P N="9">IX. This provok'd the Indignation of the Confederates, and their Spirits were mov'd thereat.</P>
<P N="10">X. Whereupon a &s;econd War broke out, and the Forces were a&s;&s;embl'd together, and they enter'd into the Plains, and many were killed on both Sides.</P>
