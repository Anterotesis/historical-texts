<L>AS &s;ome fond father, who a bantling rears,</L>
<L>Feels nought but plea&s;ure in his tender years;</L>
<L>His tricks at &s;chool, and all the pranks he plays,</L>
<L>E'en the boy's foibles then excite his prai&s;e.</L>
<L>A little &s;pirit well becomes a youth;</L>
<L>Jack, though unlucky, always &s;peaks the truth.</L>
<L>But when arriv'd at a maturer age,</L>
<L>He launches Jackey upon life's great &s;tage:</L>
<L>With joy elate, with anxious fears depre&s;t,</L>
<L>What hopes and horrors fill a parent's brea&s;t!</L>
<L>E'er yet he dares to ca&s;t the dangerous die,</L>
<L>And &s;hew his darling to the public eye,</L>
<L>The hopes of all his future joy he &s;ends,</L>
<L>To vi&s;it &s;ome, <HI>he knows</HI> to be his friends:</L>
<L><HI>Surly</HI> exclaims, eat up with gout and &s;pleen,</L>
<L>The &s;tripling's well enough, but much too lean;</L>
<L>He'll be &s;hortliv'd, he has his mother's cough,</L>
<L>A galloping con&s;umption took her off.</L>
<L>Is this Sir Jacob's &s;on? Old <HI>Toothle&s;s</HI> cries,</L>
<L>The boy is of a mo&s;t alarming &s;ize:</L>
<L>Such o'ergrown mon&s;ters never can be &s;trong;</L>
<L>Don't tell his father, but he can't live long.</L>
<L>So when the bard at fir&s;t prepares his play,</L>
<L>His heart beats high, and all his pro&s;pects gay:</L>
<L>'Tis done, 'tis done, the enraptured poet cries,</L>
<L>The labour's over, I &s;hall gra&s;p the prize;</L>
<L><HI>Snarler,</HI> upon who&s;e word I can depend;</L>
<L><HI>Snarler,</HI> &s;hall &s;ee it, he's indeed a friend.</L>
<L>How do $ou like my piece?&mdash;good critic &s;ay?</L>
<L>Nay do not flatter; don't you like the play?</L>
<L>Why yes, Sir,&mdash;eh&mdash;the thing is well enough;</L>
<L>Is it not good? Humph, yes&mdash;what cur&s;ed &s;tuff!</L>
<L>I think, my friend, the play-hou&s;e will be cramm'd!</L>
<L>I think &s;o too&mdash;and think your play 'll be damn'd.</L>
<L><PB REF="3">
At length the night, the aweful night en&s;ues,</L>
<L>Fatal to many an offspring of the mu&s;e:</L>
<L>The father bids his fancy's child appear,</L>
<L>And hopes to meet no friendly &s;narler here;</L>
<L>Moral his boy, if entertaining too,</L>
<L>His fortune's fairly made when judg'd by you.</L>

<STAGE>CROTCHET, THEODOSIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOBODY in the office? Nobody to tend the trade? Mr. Crotchet, what are you about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that a printer's bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but what can I do with my authors? No one el&s;e reads them, &s;o I mu&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get a fre&s;h &s;et, and clear away your old hack|nies; they are crippled, founder'd, work'd off their legs&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;tarv'd. Has <HI>Ful&s;ome</HI> call'd with his de|dication?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mu&s;t the pre&s;s &s;tand &s;till till that fellow's mud depo&s;its? What did <HI>Slang</HI> want in the office?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Credit for a quire of foolscap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You didn't give it him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who had been the fool then? Where's our Jacky?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Up all night, abed all morning; a whelp, a blockhead as he is. I thought to have made a great man of him, and educated him accordingly. I &s;et him out in the world as printer's devil to one of the fir&s;t pre&s;&s;es in the capital.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a pretty devil he has been ever &s;ince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I then gave him a &s;pell with our neighbour the rag-merchant, at next door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he learn there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he learn? the elements of his trade, the embryo of all good writing before it goes to the paper|mill. He might have &s;tudied letters at the foundery it&s;elf, and the mo&s;t valuable part of the chief libraries in the kingdom at the bookbinders: Nobody can &s;ay I baulk'd Jack in his education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why didn't you give him &s;ome grammar-&s;chool learning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What good had that done him? Learning only cramps the genius, and grammar does but cripple the &s;tile: Give me an author of a free clear mind. Why isn't he up in his cock-loft now with pen an ink? There's fre&s;h air that would help his fancy. There he might court the mu&s;es and the graces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>In&s;tead of which he courts them in the &s;treets to the mu&s;ic of the watchman's rattle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems then that he makes &s;ome noi&s;e in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the way, hu&s;band, what is this new work of Ful&s;ome's which you are printing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Treati&s;e on Education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has that fellow any wit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has cunning, which is cou&s;in-german to it. Ful&s;ome was u&s;her to a country &s;chool, he married the <HI>femme de chambre</HI> of a rich dowager, who took him into her family, and made him bear-leader to her booby &s;on; he danc'd him a tour thro' Europe, and publi&s;h'd it in two quarto volumes at his return, pirated from the jour|nals of other travellers, and &s;tuffed with drawings of tem|ples, bridges, aqueducts and amphitheatres, mo&s;t of which he had never &s;een, and none of which he had ever examin'd: The book &s;old, and with the profits of that and a &s;mall pen|&s;ion Ful&s;ome makes a &s;hift to live.</P>

<P>I ki&s;s your hands, worthy Mr. Crotchet; I pray you lay me at the feet of your amiable &s;pou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Compliments apart, let us to bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Where's your Dedication of the Treati&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the hands of the Dedicatee, Mrs. or Mi&s;s Diana Grampus, I prote&s;t I know not by which title to addre&s;s her, for &s;he is a virgin in the bloom of half an hundred; vain, rich, pedantic, and not a little partial to your hum|ble &s;ervant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is this to our bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience, <HI>padrone mio!</HI> it is to your bu&s;ine&s;s: in the fir&s;t place you mu&s;t think a Dedication of this &s;ort, where all the virtues, not to be found in her character, are to be hammer'd out of my brain, is no perfunctory job: in the next I mu&s;t tell you, that I have an intere&s;t in Di Grampus, on which I mean to found a project for making the fortune of a friend of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meaning your&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heroine has a nephew, the only &s;on of Sir Toby Grampus, now coming to town for the purpo&s;e of putting this uneducated cub under her protection: I have recommended the tour of Italy, and the propo&s;al takes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you're going to lead another bear round the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o, my travels are fini&s;hed, and I have made over my intere&s;t to your &s;on John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>My &s;on! my &s;on Jack a travelling tutor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not, Mr. Crotchet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I think his travels point to a quarter where few young gentlemen go for education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be di&s;couraged; I hold it for an axiom, that every man is &s;it for every thing he can get. John is giddy to be &s;ure, but with a few of my in&s;tructions he will pa&s;$: He does not want addre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call it impudence, and you are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>For &s;hame, hu&s;band; he has no more impudence
<PB N="4" REF="7">
than a man of fa&s;hion &s;hould have. I wi&s;h indeed he had the languages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that, perhaps, that wou'd be well if he had; but I hope it will be got over&mdash;a foreign lacquey mu&s;t &s;up|ply that defect: If he is ignorant of the living languages we mu&s;t puff him the more for his knowledge of the dead ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dead ones indeed, and dead they will remain for ever, if they wait for his bringing them to life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;urely he had an univer&s;ity education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are laughing at me, methinks; you know well enough what education he has had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true, as you &s;ay, my zeal there went a lit|tle too far, for I told Mrs. Diana he was a &s;cholar of the fir&s;t cla&s;s at Cambridge, carried all the prizes, all the me|dals; it was an error on the right &s;ide, for &s;he believes it, and it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to undeceive her: We mu&s;t &s;tand by what we have &s;aid. But where is he all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where he always is till noon; fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him t$ke his nap out. Send him to me as &s;oon as he is dre&s;t: let him come to my lodgings; I'll give him his cue and carry him to Di Grampus, where I warrant you we will clinch the bu&s;ine&s;s. Good morning to you! I &s;hall expect him about noon.</P>

One of your forefathers perhaps cou'd eat a whole veni&s;on pa&s;ty for his breakfa&s;t; another cou'd bend a kitchen-poker acro&s;s his arm, a third might keep hawks and greyhounds; what are they but a catalogue of in&s;ignificants?

I'll fairly put the pro's and con's for the la&s;t time, and let the &s;tronge&s;t carry it.&mdash;He's a beggar: granted; that I knew from the fir&s;t:&mdash;he's a low-born tellow, that I did not know, and that's a &s;taggering circum&s;tance&mdash;but who's to find it out?
