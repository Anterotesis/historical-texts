<HEAD>A LETTER FROM Captain <HI>TOM</HI> TO THE MOBB, Now Rais'd for Dr. Sacheberell.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen, Brothers, and Fellow-Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR &s;o I &s;hall &s;till call you, tho at pre&s;ent you fight under a U&s;urper, and in De|&s;ence of &s;o ba&s;e a Cau&s;e, that your Ho|nourable Forefathers would &s;ooner have dy'd than li&s;t up a Club or a Paring-Shovel for't $ But as I was &s;aying, Gentlemen, Do you con&s;i|der
<PB N="2" REF="2">
what it is that you are now up for? It is to ju&s;tify Dr. <HI>S&mdash;l</HI>'s Sermon again&s;t the Queen, Lords and Commons. Sure this mu&s;t be a rare Sermon, that has &s;o many and &s;o learned Friends as you to defend it! But for my part, I have drank many Pots of Ale in reading it, with &s;ome of my mo&s;t under&s;tanding Neighbours; and we can neither make Sen&s;e nor Divinity of it. I went one day to <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> and was reading it, with <HI>Will. Jobber</HI> and <HI>Dick, Trueman,</HI> and &s;ome others; and <HI>Will&punc;</HI> &s;aid, Pray God the Doctor han't been too free with my Wife, for I find many Say|ings in that Sermon &s;o like hers in &s;ome of her Tantrams, that he never could have them from any other body: And I have ask'd &s;everal Par&s;ons, both High-Church and Low-Church, about it, and all agree that there's no Doctrine, no Learning, no Depth in it; nay, that what little Scripture he has brought into't, is $al&s;ify'd with wrong Turns and Mi&s;applications. Many a better and more edifying Di&s;cour&s;e have I made in <HI>Moorfields</HI> and <HI>Lincolns. Inns-fields,</HI> and to much better Pur|po&s;es. Mine have been always in Defence of the Prote&s;tant Religion and Government; but this U&s;urping Doctor, who is now at your Head, preaches for Popery and <HI>Perkin.</HI> A Ble&s;&s;ed Cau&s;e for the free Citizens of <HI>London</HI> to appear in!</P>
<P>But then you'll &s;ay the Doctor has preach'd up Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, and you &s;tand up for them: Why, you Degenerate Boobys, if you believe the Doctor has preach'd in earne&s;t &s;uch Doctrines, what makes you ri&s;e to fly in the Face, and to re&s;i&s;t your lawful Governours? Does your Doctor preach one thing, and practi&s;e ano|ther? But alas! you are &s;o thick-skul'd, that you know not the meaning of tho&s;e words Pa&s;&s;ive Obe|dience
<PB N="3" REF="3">
and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance. I mu&s;t tell you, they are two of the mo&s;t Dangerous, De&s;tructive, Hor|rid Mon&s;ters, that ever were &s;hown in <HI>England;</HI> and if the Parliament had not &s;ecur'd them by &s;trong Chains, and confin'd them within &s;uch thick Walls, that they can never break out&punc; mo&s;t of the Men and Women in <HI>England</HI> had been devour'd by them long &s;ince, and few of the City Alder|men or Merchants had been left worth one Groat. The&s;e worthy Doctrines, which you are now huz|zaing for, gives up your Wives, your Children, your Goods and Fortunes, all to the Plea&s;ure of a Tyrannical Prince; and if he comes to take your Lives, ravi&s;h your Wives and Daughters, &amp; make Ducks &amp; Drakes of all your Money, you are only to cry, <Q>&startq;&endq;Welcome, Sir, here's my Neck at your &s;ervice: Will you plea&s;e to lie with my Wife or my Daughter? And plea&s;e to accept of all I have in the World.</Q> Is this a Cau&s;e for free|born Subjects to engage in? I am a&s;ham'd and griev'd that &s;uch &s;lavi&s;h Souls &s;hould di&s;honour the Name and Title of Mobb. But you are the fir&s;t&punc; and I hope will be the la&s;t Mobb, that ever &s;tood up again&s;t Liberty and Property, and the Freedom of the Subject. You a Mobb! You are the Scum and Dregs, the Tools and Va&s;&s;als of the Romi&s;h Brood, and &s;ent from their dark helli&s;h Cabals, once more (if you could) to blow up the Queen and Parliament.</P>
<P>Ay, #but you &s;tand up for the Church, the High-Church! Pray, Gentlemen, what Church do you mean? Is it not the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> No other was ever known in <HI>England</HI> by the Name of High-Church: and I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that if you don't mean that, you mean nothing. Does not your Bully Doctor and his Faction now join with the
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Romi&s;h Party? Are not all the Papi&s;ts and Non|jurors in the Kingdom now working and plotting to encourage him? Are not many hundreds of that vile Race now among your &s;elves? And how many <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts were known to walk&punc; &amp; huzza, and cry <HI>High-Church</HI> before your Doctor to the Temple? Pray, what Church are &s;uch Men for &s;etting up? And pray con&s;ider, if your High-Churchmen, who call them&s;elves Prote&s;tants, have not been making very fa&s;t towards <HI>Rome?</HI> Have they form'd no Projects for an Accomodation with the Popi&s;h Church in <HI>France?</HI> Have they not brought newly in among us &s;everal Popi&s;h, mere Popi&s;h Doctrines, and preach'd and publi&s;h'd them to the People? Are they not for changing the Sacrament into the Ma&s;s, the Idolatrous Ma&s;s, and making it a real Sacrifice? Are they not in&s;i&s;ting again&s;t the Queen's Supremacy in the Church? Are not the&s;e Popi&s;h Tenets now held by all your High-Churchmen? And if they have gone &s;o far under a Government which abhors Popery, what will they do when they get the Government, which they long for, on their &s;ide? Here, Gen|tlemen, lies the Danger of the Church; not in tho&s;e you call Low-Churchmen. Which of them has writ, or preach'd, or publi&s;h'd any thing in favour of the Di&s;&s;enters? If they treat the Di&s;|&s;enters civilly, and &s;ay they ought to be us'd like Men and Chri&s;tians, and good Fellow Subjects; are they for this to be call'd <HI>Fal&s;e Brethren</HI> and <HI>Traitors?</HI> If &s;o, what Brethren are they, that keep con&s;tant company with Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, that &s;et up profe&s;s'd Jacobites for the Champions of their Party, that retail the pitiful Papers of the Nonjurors throughout the Kingdom, and lick
<PB N="5" REF="5">
up the Spittle of that Party, to &s;putter it out a|gain from their Pulpits?</P>
<P>You know, Gentlemen, that I was ever for Ju&s;tice and fair Play, and for calling a Spade a Spade; and if you will have tho&s;e you call Low-Churchmen to be Di&s;&s;enters, then I claim all the High Ones for Papi&s;ts, and will be bound to make out a much better Title to mine, than you can do to yours.</P>
<P>But will your Wi&s;doms plea&s;e to con&s;ider, what Danger the Church is in, what one Injury has been done to it; is any part of its Doctrine or Di&s;|cipline incroach'd upon? Is any part of its Re|venues or Incomes taken away? Has any one Mi|ni&s;ter of the Church been di&s;turb'd or affronted for doing his Duty? Are not the Laws &amp; Judges as favourable to it as ever? Are not the Bi&s;hops as much re&s;pected, and have as much Power and Credit as at any time &s;ince the Reformation? Does any Man traduce or vilify the worthy Pre|lates who pre&s;erve our Con&s;titution, except your High-Churchmen? and yet the&s;e are the Men for whom you leave your Stalls and your Bulks, to cry up High-Church. You be&s;otted Fools! get you home to your Hou&s;es, if you have any, and bor|row &s;o much Sen&s;e from your hone&s;t Neighbours, as to know that the Church is in no Danger, &s;ince it has God to protect it, the Queen, and &s;o many good Bi&s;hops to govern it, and the Lords and Commons to defend it, and a moderate peaceable Clergy to a&s;&s;ert its Doctrines, and at the &s;ame time not to drive Men away from it by Fury, Ma|lice and Railing. And now that you have ap|pear'd in &s;uch a wretched Cau&s;e, and under &s;uch a Tool of a Champion, what mighty Actions have you done? Why truly you have gutted half a
<PB N="6" REF="6">
dozen Meeting-Hou&s;es, and burnt the Pews: Great Feats indeed! Did any of you attempt a Jacobite or Popi&s;h Conventicle? No, the&s;e are your Ringleaders, the Knaves that work by &s;uch &s;tupid Fools; you mu&s;t not affront them nor your Ma&s;ter <HI>Perkin.</HI> But I think that few of you &s;tir for this Cau&s;e alone, but to plunder, and rob, and pilfer Hou&s;es, and to beg or force Money from them, who dare not dony you. You Thieves, you everla&s;ting Blot and Di&s;grace to the Honour of the Mobility! Did you ever hear or know that the Citizens, which I have &s;o often and gloriou&s;ly headed, did rob, or take Money, or plunder Hou|&s;es? No, you poor mercenary Wretches, when I and my Friends ro&s;e, it was for Ju&s;tice, and Liber|ty, and the Government, and the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion; and any one of mine that &s;hould take the value of a Penny to enrich him&s;elf, I would have hang'd him. But you &s;coundrel Rogues and Beg|gars do it for Bread and Wages. And why &s;o hard upon poor Dr. <HI>Burge&s;s?</HI> Does not he divert you and your Betters two or three times a week at his own Expence? Has he or any of his Brethren preach'd or practis'd any thing again&s;t the Govern|ment? Are not their People quiet, and loyal, and peaceable under Her Maje&s;ty? Have not they con|tributed to the Revolution and the War, as much Blood and Trea&s;ure as their Neighbours? Have they not paid their Taxes as chearfully? And which of them have been found in any Plots or Trea&s;ons to bring in the <HI>French</HI> and your little Idol? Is it for being &s;uch good Subjects that their Hou&s;es mu&s;t be pull'd down; &amp; becau&s;e they have Toleration by Law, mu&s;t they therefore be mur|der'd&punc; If there were one Drop of Prote&s;tant Blood in the whole Body of you, you cou'd not be
<PB N="7" REF="7">
&s;uch ignorant be&s;otted Bea&s;ts, &s;o blindly to damn your &s;elves and ruin your Neighbours, and all to make the Nation Slaves, and to bring in Wooden Shoes and <HI>French</HI> Popery.</P>
<P>But to let you &s;ee that you are wor&s;e than Brutes, that you are Rebels and Vipers in the Bo&s;om of the Government; your hone&s;t and brave Country-Men have for twenty Years pa&s;t hazarded their Lives in War again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and under the Con|duct of the great &amp; gallant Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> have brought more Honour and Glory to the Queen and Her Kingdoms, than all the Reigns of Her Predece&s;&s;ors together. And now that they have beaten the Tyrant Mon&s;ieur, and forc'd him to beg a Peace; you his hir'd Slaves, and Trai|tors to GOD and your Country, have ri&s;en up to breed War and Sedition at Home: and by your Means, and the Hopes given the old Tyrant by your unnatural Rebellion, he de&s;igns to get that Advantage by your Villany and Treachery, that he never yet was able to get in the Field. Are you not rare <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> fine Churchmen, excel|lent Prote&s;tants, who now at this Time, when a happy Peace &s;eems to draw on very fa&s;t towards us, are doing all in your Power to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Enemy of our Religion and Country, and to force &s;uch Terms of Peace upon us, as that cruel Tyrant may think fit to give? But this will be the la&s;t Attempt of you and your treacherous Party, and I doubt not to &s;ee many of the harde&s;t and highe&s;t Heads of you ju&s;tly hang'd up for it. I had &s;ome Thoughts to bring a hundred or two of my brave &amp; hearty Friends to &s;uppre&s;s you and your Thou&s;ands; but the Government have &s;ent a few Hor&s;e &amp; Foot, at the Sight of whom you run like your &s;elves, and do now &s;culk like Jail-Birds, as I know the mo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="8">
of you are. Yet I am told that you talk of ap|pearing again; which if you da$e do, I &s;hall &s;hew you the Difference between freeborn, natural <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tant Courage, and the ra&s;cal Cowardice of Popi&s;h Slaves, who rebel again&s;t their Queen and Country for <HI>French</HI> Money. I revoke the Titles of Gentlemen, &amp;c. that I gave you in the Begin|ning of this Letter; for upon &s;econd and better Thoughts, you are &s;uch a Pack of hireling Scoun|drels, that I now defy and de&s;pi&s;e you; and if you &s;tir once more, am re&s;olv'd to cha&s;ti&s;e you &s;everely.</P>
