<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF GRAFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Beggleave to recommend a trifling per|formance to Your notice; nothing but my venturing to approach Your Grace on this occa&s;ion without introduction, could excu&s;e my addre&s;&s;ing you without a name: by this kind of &s;ophi&s;try, my Lord, we that &s;et|up for Poets attempt to palliate one pre|&s;umption by another. As I have &s;trong temptations to plead for the honor I now a&s;&s;ume, &s;o, I hope, I am not totally without preten&s;ions to it. As an humble &s;on of that Alma Mater, who has now be&s;towed on Your Grace the mo&s;t honorable adoption, which maternal approbation had to give, I
<PB N="iv" REF="3" MS="Y">
flatter my&s;elf that I &s;tand in &s;ome degree of alliance to you; and if there be any thing in the&s;e &s;cenes that de&s;erves the name of Genius, I am happy in acquainting the world that I drew it from the &s;ame fountain, and, nearly, at the &s;ame period with Your Grace; though not in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>As I only &s;eek, by this offering, to amu&s;e a lei&s;ure-hour, I have no right either to &s;peak to Your Grace, or of Your Grace, as a Mini&s;ter. Neverthele&s;s, my Lord, in the&s;e ill-tempered times, I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, that there is &s;ome merit when your fortune needs no addition, and your rank cannot re|ceive any, in &s;tanding-forth the &s;ervant and the &s;ufferer of your country: I &s;ay the &s;uf|ferer, my Lord, becau&s;e in your &s;tation you have to combat not only the envy&punc; but the ingratitude of mankind.</P>
<P>In times of peace the Mu&s;es, more e&s;pe|cially, look for protection at the thrones of Princes, and in the clo&s;ets of Mini&s;ters. In &s;ea&s;ons of public tranquillity, when good order and good humour obtain in a nation, the great may find an ear even for &s;uch trifles as I now lay before You. Did the&s;e times,
<PB N="v" REF="4" MS="Y">
my Lord, an&s;wer that De&s;cription, I &s;hould have much to &s;ay to Your Grace on the Sub|ject of the Stage, &s;o applicable to noble u&s;es, and of the low ebb at which Genius now &s;tands, &s;o much in need of cultivation; but the&s;e are topicks too harmonious for an aera that &s;eems to delight in di&s;cord; and all the merit I can claim with Your Grace and the public is, that at a time when all other ano|nymous writers have been &s;cattering the &s;eeds of di&s;content and di&s;turbance, I have u&s;ed my be&s;t endeavours in the following &s;cenes to lead &s;uch of my countrymen, as have attended their repre&s;entation, into a &s;hort paroxy&s;m of complacency and good humour. I have the honor to be</P>

<P>IT blows a rank &s;torm; 'tis well, father, we haul'd the boat a&s;hore before the weather came on; &s;he's &s;afe be&s;tow'd, however, let what will happen.</P>

<P>Well, children, well, if you can bear misfortunes patiently, 'twere an ill office for me to repine; we have long till'd the earth for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; now, Philip, we mu&s;t plough the ocean; in tho&s;e waves lies our harve&s;t; there, my brave lad, we have an equal inheritance with the be&s;t.</P>

<P>True, father, the &s;ea that feeds us, provides us an habitation here in the hollow of the cliff; I tru&s;t, the '&s;quire will exact no rent for this dwelling&mdash;Alas! that ever two brothers &s;hould have been &s;o oppo&s;ite as our mercile&s;s landlord, and the poor young gentleman they &s;ay is now dead.</P>

<P>On board; no per&s;ua&s;ions can prevail on him to quit the &s;hip, which, he &s;wears, will lift with the tide; his old crony&punc; the ma&s;ter is with him, and they ply the ca&s;ks &s;o bri&s;kly, that it &s;eems a moot point, which fills the fa&s;te&s;t, they, or the wreck.</P>

<P>Strange in&s;en&s;ibility! but you mu&s;t bring him off by force then, if there is no other way of &s;aving him; I think o'my con&s;cience he is as indifferent to danger as the plank he treads on; we are now thrown upon my un|natural brother's e&s;tate; that hou&s;e, Francis, which you &s;ee to the left, is his; and what may be the con&s;equence if he and my uncle &s;hou'd meet, I know not; for &s;uch has been Captain Iron&s;ides' re&s;entment on my account, that he has declared war again&s;t the very name of Belfield; and, in one of his whim&s;ical pa&s;&s;ions, you know, in&s;i&s;ted on my laying it a&s;ide for ever; &s;o that hitherto&punc; I have been known on board by no other name, than that of Lew&s;on.</P>

<P>Upon my word I am young Mr. Belfield's mo&s;t ob&s;e|quious &s;ervant: a very notable confu&s;ion truly has he been plea&s;ed to make in my family. Lady Dove raves, Sophia cries; my wife calls him a &s;aucy impudent fellow, my daughter &s;ays he's a ba&s;e&punc; treacherous wretch; from all which I am to conclude, that he has &s;poke$ too plain truths to the one, and told too many lies to the other: one lady is irritated becau&s;e he has refus$d favours; the other, perhaps, is afflicted becau&s;e he has obtain$d 'em. Lady Dove has peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon my giving him a challenge; but, to &s;ay the truth, I had no great &s;to|mach to the bu&s;ine&s;s, till this fre&s;h provocation: I per|ceive now I am growing into a mo&s;t unaccountable rage; 'tis &s;omething &s;o different from what I ever felt before,
<PB N="50" REF="57" MS="Y">
that, for what I know, it may be courage and I mi&s;take it for anger; I never did quarrel with any man, and hitherto no man ever quarrel'd with me: egad, if once I break the ice, it &s;han't &s;top here: if young Belfield doesn't prove me a coward, lady Dove &s;hall &s;ee that I am a man of &s;pirit.&mdash;Sure I &s;ee my gentleman coming hither again.</P>

Our wives, Mr. Belfield, may teaze us and vex us, and &s;till e&s;cape with impunity; but if once they thoroughly provoke us, the charm breaks, and they are lo&s;t for ever.</P>

<P>What's that you &s;ay, Captain Iron&s;ides? Let's have a word in a corner with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'e, Sir, if you conceive your&s;elf wrong'd by me, there is but one way&mdash;You know your remedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know your meaning, brother; and to demon&s;trate how much greater my courage is than yours, I mu&s;t confe$s to you I dare not accept your propo&s;al.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I've given him enough of that I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bob Belfield, if I did not know thee for a lad of mettle, I &s;hou'dn't tell what to make of all this: for my own part, I under&s;tand none of your &s;cruples and refinements, not I; a man is a man; and if I take care to give an af|front to no man, I think, I have a right to take an affront from no man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, gentlemen, &s;u&s;pend your di&s;pute; here comes my daughter, let her decide betwixt you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me receive my &s;entence from her lips, and I will &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SOPHIA, PATERSON, <HI>and</HI> LADY DOVE.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a young gentleman, daughter, that will take no denial; he comes to forbid the ban$s ju&s;t when you are both going into the church to be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word this is &s;omething extraordinary. What are the gentleman's rea&s;ons for this behaviour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He claims a &s;ort of promi&s;e from me that he &s;hou'd be indulg'd in an hour's conver&s;ation with you, before you give your hand to his brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>An hour's conver&s;ation! What little that gentleman can have to &s;ay to me I believe may be &s;aid in a very few minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="76" MS="Y">
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, brother, this conver&s;ation don't promi&s;e a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then I own to this gentleman and the company pre&s;ent, that there was a time, when I enter|tain'd the highe&s;t opinion of his merit. Nay, I will not &s;cruple to confe&s;s that I had conceiv'd a regard for him of the tendere&s;t &s;ort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, young lady, how came my nephew to for|feit your good opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a conduct, Sir, that mu&s;t for ever forfeit not my e&s;teem only, but yours and all mankind's: I am &s;orry to be his accu&s;er, but I will appeal to you, Mr. Belfield, who are his brother, whether it is reconcil$able either to honour or humanity to pro&s;ecute an affair of marriage with one woman, when you are previou&s;ly and indi&s;pen|&s;ibly engaged to another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph&punc;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet this, Sir, is the treatment I have receiv'd: judge, therefore, if I can de&s;ire or con&s;ent to have any long con|ver&s;ation with a gentleman who is under &s;uch engage|ments&punc; nay, whom I can prove actually married to another woman in this very hou&s;e, and ready to vouch the truth of what I a&s;&s;ert. Judge for me, Mr. Belfield; cou'd you believe any man capable of &s;uch complicated, &s;uch inconceivable villa$ny?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven's! This touches me too clo&s;ely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I wou'd fain know what excu&s;e you can have for this behaviour; I can tell you, Sir, I don't under&s;tand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! fie! fie upon you, Mr. Belfield! I wonder you are not a&s;ham$d to &s;how your face in this family.</P>

<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;irrah, wou'd not one wife content you? 'tis enough in all rea&s;on for one man; is it not, Sir Benjamin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, when it is prov'd I am married, accu&s;e me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'e Bob, I don't accu&s;e you for marrying, 'twas an indi&s;cretion and I can forgive it; but to deny it&punc; is a meanne&s;s, and I abhor it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Belfield, do you &s;ay nothing upon this occa&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pater&s;on, I am &s;tr$ck to the heart; I cannot &s;upport my guilt&punc; I am married to Violetta; &s;ave me the confu&s;ion of relating it; this di&s;honourable engagement for ever I renounce, nor will I re&s;t till I have made atonement to an injur'd wife. Madam, I beg leave to withdraw for a few minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir, this contrivance is of your forging; you have touch'd me too near; and now, if you dare draw your &s;word, follow me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, gentlemen, you forget the lady is now in the hou&s;e; &s;he is a witne&s;s, that will effectually put an end to your di&s;pute: I will conduct her hither.</P>

<P>Hark'e nephew, I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect you have been laying a train to blow your&s;elf up: if once Bob comes fairly along&s;ide of you, you'll find your quarters too hot to hold you: I never yet found my boy out in a lye, and &s;han't tamely &s;ee a l$e impos'd upon him; for, while he is hone&s;t and I have breath, he &s;hall never want a friend to &s;tand by him&punc; or a father to protect him.</P>
