<P>Lord! Sir, if my ma&s;ter makes no more ha&s;te, we &s;hall all be put to &s;word by the knives of the natives; I'm told they take off heads like hats, and hang 'em on pegs in their parlours. Mercy an us! My head

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Head aches! Zounds, &s;o does mine with your confounded bawling. It's enough to bring all the na|tives about us, and we &s;hall be &s;tript and plunder'd in a minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; &s;tripping is the fir&s;t thing that wou'd happen to us; for they &s;eem to be woefully off for a wardrobe. I my&s;elf &s;aw three at a di&s;tance with le&s;s cloaths than I have when I get out of bed; all dancing about in black buff; ju&s;t like Adam in mourning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This it is to have to do with a &s;chemer! a fel|low who ri&s;ques his life, for a chance of advancing his intere&s;t.&mdash;Always advantage in view! Trying here to make di&s;coveries that may promote his profit in England. Another Botany Bay &s;cheme, mayhap. Nothing el&s;e could induce him to quit our foraging party from the &s;hip; when he knows every inhabitant here is not only as black as a pepper-corn, but as hot into the bargain&mdash; and <HI>I,</HI> like a fool, to follow him! and then to let him loiter behind.&mdash;Why, Nephew!&mdash;Why, Inkle.&mdash;<STAGE><HI>calling</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why Ink&mdash;Well! Only to &s;ee the dif|ference of men; he'd have thought it very hard, now, if I had let him call &s;o often after me. Ah! I wi&s;h he was calling after me now in the old jog-trot way again. What a fool was I to leave London for foreign parts! &mdash;That ever I &s;hou'd leave Threadneedle-&s;treet, to thread an American fore&s;t, where a man's as &s;oon lo&s;t as a needle in a bottle of hay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Patience, Trudge! Patience! If we once re|cover the &s;hip &mdash;.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord &s;ir, I &s;hall never recover what I have lo&s;t in coming abroad. When my ma&s;ter and I were in London, I had &s;uch a mortal &s;nug birth of it! Why I was <HI>factotum.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Factotum to a young merchant is no &s;uch &s;ine|cure neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But then the honor of it. Think of that, &s;ir; to be clerk as well as <HI>own man.</HI> Only con&s;ider. You find very few city clerks made out of a man now-a-days.
<PB N="9" REF="6">
To be king of the counting-hou&s;e, as well as lord of the bed-chamber. Ah! if I had him but now in the little dre&s;&s;ing-room behind the office; tying his hair with a bit of red tape as u&s;ual.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, Mr. Medium.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, one wou'd think, by your confounded compo&s;ure, that you were walking in St. James's Park in&s;tead of an American fore&s;t, and that all the bea&s;ts were nothing but good company. The hollow trees here, centry boxes, and the lions in 'em &s;oldiers; the ja$kalls, courtiers, the crocodiles, fine women, and the baboons, beaux. What the plague made you loiter &s;o long?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Reflection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So I &s;hou'd think; reflection generally comes lagging behind. What, &s;cheming, I &s;uppo&s;e? never quiet. At it again, eh? What a happy trader is your father, to have &s;o prudent a &s;on for a partner! Why, you are the carefulle&s;t Co. in the whole city; never lo&s;ing fight of the main chance, and that's the rea&s;on perhaps you lo&s;t &s;ight of us here on the main of America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Mr. Medium. Arithmetic I own has been the means of our parting at pre&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! A &s;um in divi&s;ion I reckon.<STAGE><HI>A&s;ide.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, if I may be &s;o bold, what mighty &s;cheme has ju&s;t tempted you to employ your head, when you ought to make u&s;e of your heels?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My heels! Here's pretty doctrine! Do you think I travel merely for motion? A fine expen&s;ive plan
<PB N="10" REF="7">
for a trader truly. What, wou'd you have a man of bu&s;ine&s;s come abroad, &s;camper extravagantly here and there and every where, then return home, and have nothing to tell, but that he has <HI>been</HI> here and there and every where? 'Sdeath, Sir, would you have me travel like a lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, the Lord forbid! <Q>&startq;but I am wrong perhaps! there is &s;omething in the air of this fore&s;t, &endq;I believe, that inclines people to be ha&s;ty</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Travelling, Uncle, was always intended for improvement, and improvement is an advantage; and advantage is profit, and profit is gain. Which in the travelling tran&s;lation of a trader, means that you &s;hou'd gain every advantage of improving your profit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How&mdash;gain, and advantage, and profit? "Zounds I'm quite at a lo&s;s."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You've hit it Uncle! &s;o am I. I have lo&s;t <Q>&startq;my clue by your conver&s;ation; you have knock'd all &endq;my meditations on the head.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Its very lucky for you, no-body has done it "before me."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have been comparing the land here, with that of our own country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And you find it like a good deal of the land of our own country&mdash;cur&s;edly encumber'd with black legs, I take it.</P>
</SP>

<P>And calculating how much it might be made to produce by the acre.</P>

<P>Arn't we bound for Barbadoes, partly to trade, but chiefly to carry home the daughter of the go|vernor, Sir Chri&s;topher Curry, who has till now been under your father's care in Threadneedle-&s;treet for polite Engli&s;h education?</P>

<P>Then what the devil do you do here hunting old hairy negroes, when you ought to be ogling a fine girl in the &s;hip? Algebra too! You'll have other things to think of when you are married, I promi&s;e you! a plodding fellow's head in the hands of a young wife, like a boy's &s;late after &s;chool, &s;oon gets all its arithmetick wip'd off, and then it appears in its true &s;imple &s;tate: dark, empty, and bound in wood, Ma&s;ter Inkle.</P>

<P>Not in a match of this kind. Why it's a table of intere&s;t from beginning to end, old Medium.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, this is no time to talk. Who knows but in&s;tead of &s;ailing to a wedding, we may get cut up here for a wedding dinner, to&s;s'd up for a dingy duke perhaps, or &s;tew'd down for a black baronet, or eat raw by an Inky commoner?</P>

<P>Who, I afraid! Ha! ha! ha! No, not I! What the deuce &s;hould I be afraid of? Thank heaven I have a clear con&s;cience, and need not be afraid of any thing. A &s;coundrel might not be quite &s;o ea&s;y on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; but it's the part of an hone&s;t man not to behave like a &s;coundrel.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Madam, how is it po&s;&s;ible to help talking? We are in Barbadoes here to be &s;ure&mdash;but then, Ma'am, one may let out a little in a private morn|ing's walk by our&s;elves.</P>

<P>Nay, it's the &s;ame thing with you in doors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to &s;ay the truth, Ma'am, tho' we do <Q>&startq;live in your father's hou&s;e, Sir Chri&s;topher Curry, the grand governor that governs all Barbadoes&mdash; and a terrible po&s;itive Governor he is to be &s;ure; yet, he'll find it a difficult matter to govern a cham|bermaid's &endq;tongue, I believe.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That I am &s;ure of, Patty; for it runs as ra|pidly "as the tide which brought us from England.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Ma'am, it has been too well train'd <Q>&startq;in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, I promi&s;e you; and if ever it &s;ays any thing to your di&s;advantage, my name &endq;is not Patty Prink.</Q>&mdash;I never blab, Ma'am, never, as I hope for a gown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And your never blabbing, as you call it, de|pends chiefly on that hope, I believe. The unlocking my che&s;t, locks up all your faculties. An old &s;ilk gown makes you turn your back on all my &s;ecrets; a large bonnet blinds your eyes, and a fa&s;hionable high hand|kerchief covers your ears, and &s;tops your mouth at once, Patty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Ma'am, how can you think a body &s;o mercenary! Am I always tea&s;ing you about gowns and gew-gaws, and fallals and finery? Or do you take me for a conjuror, that nothing will come out of my mouth but ribbons? I have told the &s;tory of our voyage, in|deed, to old Guzzle, the butler, who is very inqui&s;itive; and, between our&s;elves, is the uglie&s;t old Quiz I ever &s;aw in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I have &s;een him; pitted with the &s;mall-pox and a red face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Ma'am. It's for all the world like his ma&s;ter's cellar, full of holes and liquor; but when he a&s;ks me what you and I think of the matter, why I look wi&s;e, and cry like other wi&s;e people who have nothing to &s;ay&mdash; All's for the be&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, thus, you lead him to imagine I am but little inclin'd to the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Ma'am, how cou'd that be? Why, I never &s;aid a word about Captain Campley.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="26">
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, Ma'am, not I. But if our voyage from England was &s;o plea&s;ant, it wasn't owing to Mr. Inkle, I'm certain. He didn't play the fiddle in our cabin, and dance on the deck, and come langui&s;hing with a gla&s;s of warm water in his hand, when we were &s;ea-&s;ick. Ah, Ma'am, that water warm'd your heart, I'm confident. Mr. Inkle! No, no; Captain Cam&mdash;<Q>&startq;there, he &endq;has &s;topped my Mouth again Ma'am.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear me, Ma'am. But if &s;omebody I know is not acquainted with the Governor, there's &s;uch a thing as dancing at balls, and &s;queezing hands when you lead up, and &s;queezing them again when you ca&s;t down, and walking on the Quay in a morning.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And that, as the world goes, is more than every man can &s;ay for him&s;elf. Yet, &s;ince you force me to &s;peak, my po&s;itive qualities&mdash;but, no matter&mdash;you re|member me in London; <Q>&startq;and know, there was &s;carcely
<PB N="44" REF="41">
a laudable in&s;titution in town without my name in the li&s;t.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Chr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, dam'me, if I wou'd not kick any man into the New River that had done me an injury. There's the difference of our hone&s;ty. Oons! if you want to be an hone&s;t fellow, act from the impul&s;e of nature. Why, you have no more gall than a pigeon.</P>

My bu&s;ine&s;s is to prevent young &s;ober&s;ides, Young Inkle, from appealing to interrupt the ceremony. &mdash;Ha! here's the Crown, where I hear he is hous'd.
