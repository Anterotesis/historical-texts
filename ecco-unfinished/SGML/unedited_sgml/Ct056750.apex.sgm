<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, nay good wife not &s;o loud, or I vani&s;h. Five and twenty years have I expos'd my organs of hearing (aye, and though I &s;ay it, without whining too) to the encounter of the toughe&s;t lungs in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, with no wor&s;e effect as yet, than a moderate deafne&s;s of the left ear; and a whizzing from time to time in the right, but that dear lovely, indefatigable tongue of thine, &s;o far outdins $he bar it&s;elf, that though a lawyer&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lawyer! why in that trim you look more like a client, than a lawyer, and no one, to &s;ee you in &s;uch a dre&s;s, wou'd imagine you had ever carried on a &s;uit, in any one's name but your own. Out upon you, you are a di&s;grace to the profe&s;&s;ion, and had you a grain of &s;pirit&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spirit! oh, there at lea&s;t you wrong me, and I defy any practitioner of twice my &s;tanding to produce more in&s;tances of &s;pirit, than I have; who expo&s;es him|&s;elf to the di&s;plea&s;ure of the judges; or the cen&s;ure of
<PB N="4" REF="4">
the courts. Shew me the man that &s;ets the pedantic regulations of common practice more at defiance than I have done&punc; hav'n't I been obliged to quit the London courts only for di&s;playing too much &s;pirit on a certain occa&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine truly! and do you boa&s;t of your blunders, and make a merit of your di&s;grace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>This accident to be &s;ure forces me to try my talents in the ob&s;curity of rural practice; and yet &s;ince our removal to this village, though next door to Ju&s;|tice Mittimus, the be&s;t accu&s;tom'd Magi&s;trate in the whole country, no favourable opportunity has offer'd; not a hare has been &s;nar'd, or a head broke, or (what is &s;tranger &s;till) a &s;ingle ba&s;tard born, though we have been here a whole fortnight, nay the very cattle keep out of pound, to &s;pite me. But come have a little pa|tience, times will mend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in the mean time, your wife is to &s;tarve, and your daughter, to lo&s;e the opportunity of &s;ettling her&s;elf in the world, by a match with one or other of the young men, who court her, and whom the pover|ty of your appearance frighten away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to &s;ay the truth there is nothing in my dre&s;s that can bring either lovers to my daughter, or clients to my&s;elf. Mankind is govern'd by &s;hew, and the &s;ure&s;t way to obtain the countenance of the world is never to appear to want it. Cou'd I but once put on the appearance of bu&s;ine&s;s, the reality perhaps wou'd &s;oon follow, let me &s;ee&mdash;cou'dn't I&mdash;yes I have it&mdash;I'll
<PB N="5" REF="5">
go, and purcha&s;e me a hand&s;ome &s;uit of clothes im|mediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hand&s;ome &s;uit of clothes! what, without a farthing in your pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?&mdash;in London all your hand&s;ome &s;uits are purchas'd the &s;ame way.&mdash;What colour &s;hall I chu&s;e? bats&punc;wing&mdash;or&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no matter for the colour if you can find any one kind enough to tru&s;t you with the cloaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to lo&s;e no time, I'll &s;tep over the way to the rich drapers, my neighbour Snarl's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>To neighbour Snarl's! have a care what you do there. You know his Son Charles is in love with our Harriet, and wou'd have married her before now, but for fear of his father; I wou'd not for the world you &s;hould do any thing to overthrow my daughter's hopes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, &s;tep in and fetch my hat and gown. <STAGE><HI>Exit&punc;</HI> Mrs S.</STAGE></P>
<P>I have ju&s;t time to &s;lip it on; it will give me a more creditable appearance before old Snarl, and the&s;e rags of mine into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>MRS SCOUT,</HI> with gown and hat.</STAGE>
<P>Aye, this will do.&mdash;How many &s;leek, &s;pruce, demure looking gowns are there in the world, as well as this, good for nothing el&s;e, but covering things not fit to be &s;een. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<P>Why &s;urely Father, you have no fault to find with Sheepface.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h I cou'd &s;ay as much for my&s;elf; but I find that <HI>my</HI> father was indebted to <HI>yours</HI> in a &s;mall balance of 50 pounds, and as a man of honor I am come home to pay it you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, if tho&s;e who are indebted to me, had a little of my punctuality, I &s;hould be a richer man than I am, but to have my name in any one's book is a thing I can't bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet the generality of people bear it very patiently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, I have it at home, ready told; but as I have the management of my father's effects, only as guardian for my daughter Harriet, its proper that the other guardians &s;hou'd be by at the payment.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true Sir, then what do you think of to|morrow at three o'clock?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, but I have interrupted you perhaps. <STAGE>(ri&s;es)</STAGE> Why Sir, you do more bu&s;ine&s;s than all the &s;hopkeepers in this part of the country put together.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't complain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you have &s;uch a way with you, that tho&s;e who buy once, can't for the blood of them, help co|ming to you again. A pretty bit of cloth this&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pretty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>One meets in your &s;hop, &s;uch a genero&s;ity of treatment, a politene&s;s of behaviour, that makes it plea&s;anter to <HI>pay</HI> money to you than to receive it el&s;e|where. The wool &s;eems tolerably fine.</P>

<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right Spani&s;h wool every hair of it, Sir.</P>

<P>A goo&s;e! that's my favourite di&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>And my wife &s;hall dre&s;s it by a family receipt. Its a trea&s;ure, that receipt's a perfect trea&s;ure. Her uncle, the late Alderman Dumpling, pa&s;s'd through
<PB N="11" REF="11">
the whole circle of corporation honours, and died Mayor by virtue of that receipt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! Aye!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Mrs Scout will be happy to &s;ee you; now I think on't, I promis'd her, that you &s;hould have my cu&s;tom for the future, and to make a beginning I don't care if I have the pattern of a &s;uit of cloaths from you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very happy to accommodate you Sir; what colour wou'd you choo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colour! why here's a pretty one enough to my mind Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pretty indeed Sir; its an iron grey. Shall I cut off the quantity you want, to have it ready?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>To have it ready; no Mr. Snarl, pay as you go, that's my rule; pay as you go.</P>

<P>Ecod, an excellent rule it is.</P>

<P>Why Sir, another &s;hou'd pay me nineteen and &s;ixpence; but come, you &s;hall have it at nineteen &s;hillings.&mdash;Now I think of it. Here's your quantity ready cut.</P>
