<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A GENEROUS concern for the welfare of his country, and an earne&s;t attention to alleviate private di&s;tre&s;s, were the virtues which chiefly recom|mended Mr. Hanway to your Lord&s;hip's e&s;teem. To the&s;e virtues, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a mo&s;t eminent degree by your Lord&s;hip, are added (happily for mankind) a &s;plen|dour of rank, and affluence of fortune, which &s;ave your Lord&s;hip the &s;orrow his confined fortune often made him feel
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
at the fight of mi&s;ery which he could not relieve.</P>
<P>The loyalty of your ance&s;tors, &s;hewn in the mo&s;t dangerous and perturbed times; their zeal for the cau&s;e of true religion, and their profound learning, are reflected back by your Lord&s;hip with an increa&s;e of &s;plendour: but as the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed qualities did not prevent you from re&s;pecting him, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no eminent degree of learning, and who&s;e loyalty and love of virtue were confined to a narrow &s;phere, whil&s;t he was living; I tru&s;t that this feeble at|tempt to delineate his character, now he is no more, will not be received by your Lord&s;hip with di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I SUBMIT the following &s;heets to the in&s;pection of the public with all be|coming deference. They are the pro|duce of a few hours, which I have been able to &s;pare, in broken and detached portions, from nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s; and partake, I fear, very &s;ufficiently of the di&s;traction of thought, which &s;uch a mode of compo&s;ition always occa&s;ions in &s;ome degree. But whatever may be their reception with the world, they
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
have had the effect on my own mind to alleviate the &s;orrow which I felt at the lo&s;s of a mo&s;t valuable patron and friend, under who&s;e roof I re&s;ided from my early youth, and by who&s;e coun&s;el I have e&s;caped many of the dangers to which youth is expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have met with no greater difficulties in this work than I &s;uppo&s;e u&s;ually oc|cur to every one who makes a fir&s;t at|tempt of this kind: The mo&s;t trouble-&s;ome have been occa&s;ioned by the lea&s;t material parts, &s;uch as the a&s;certaining of dates. It is of very little con&s;e|quence to the world, which will rever|ence Mr. Hanway only for his own per|&s;onal conduct, whether he was the ne|phew or the grand&s;on of Sir Jonas Moore; whether he was born on the &s;econd or on
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
the twelfth of Augu&s;t, or whether his father was a &s;tore-keeper, or an agent victualler; yet it was expected that the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;hould be mentioned, and certificates, which I have always taken for my guide, where they were attain|able, were &s;ometimes not ea&s;ily to be procured.</P>
<P>One difficulty, peculiar to my &s;tation in life, and which may not be perceived by the reader, was to dive&s;t my&s;elf of the &s;tyle of the profe&s;&s;ion I was bred to; which, though well calculated to ex|pre&s;s legal certainty, would not &s;uit a work of this kind.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the account I have given of the many charitable in&s;titutions, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment or promotion of
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
which Mr. Hanway was engaged, I have endeavoured as much as po&s;&s;ible to make it faithful and correct. It may po&s;&s;ibly be in the power of the &s;ecretaries of &s;ome of them to correct me in &s;everal in&s;tances relating to their own peculiar object: yet I flatter my&s;elf it would be difficult for an individual to give an account of them all collectively, which might be depended on with more &s;afety than that to be found in this work.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway's life, particularly the latter years of it, was a cour&s;e of &s;uch noble and benevolent actions, that it de|&s;erved to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity by the mo&s;t elegant pen; but I believe no per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o many materials for the work as my&s;elf, and I have, with,
<PB N="ix" REF="10">
perhaps, too much &s;elf complacency, concluded that this would compen&s;ate for the want of adequate abilities.</P>
<P>I cannot leave the reader to the peru|&s;al of the work, without fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ing the obligation I am under to Mr. George Peters, governor of the Bank, for the readine&s;s with which he has been plea&s;ed to communicate to me many circum|&s;tances in the life of his re&s;pected friend, which I could have learned from no other per&s;on.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e indebted to Mr. Henry Bu&s;by, for &s;everal u&s;eful pieces of infor|mation: Indeed, whatever plea&s;ure or in|&s;truction the reader may derive from the performance, will be owing to the la&s;t gentleman, who peru&s;ed the copy whil&s;t

<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> REMARKABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE LIFE OF JONAS HANWAY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>THE life of a man eminent for di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in his own private concerns, and an unremitted attention to the welfare and happine&s;s of others; who devoted his time, his labour, and his for|tune to the &s;ervice of his fellow crea|tures, and made univer&s;al philanthropy the
<PB N="2" REF="13">
ruling principle of his action, cannot but be acceptable to all; becau&s;e it holds up, for imitation, an example of virtues, which all e&s;teem, and which all may attain if they re&s;olve to take the means.</P>
<P>But Mr. Hanway's life was not confined merely to a round of actions, which, though excellent in them&s;elves, are perhaps not the mo&s;t intere&s;ting in the recital: Some years of the early part of it were &s;pent in a coun|try but imperfectly known to the Engli&s;h before his time: Per&s;ia, when he was there, was the theatre of the mo&s;t remarkable tran&s;|actions; and the contemplative reader will not fail to compare in his mind the events of the pre&s;ent age, with tho&s;e of the times of Cyrus and Darius, and feel an additional motive to revere that Providence in who&s;e hand is the fate of mighty empires.</P>
<P>JONAS HANWAY, E&s;q. was born at Port&s;mouth, in Hamp&s;hire, on the twelfth day of Augu&s;t, 1712. His father, Mr.
<PB N="3" REF="14">
Thomas Hanway, was an officer in the naval line, and for &s;ome years &s;tore-keeper to the dock-yard at Port&s;mouth. He was depriv|ed of his life by an accident, and left his widow with four children, Jonas, William, Thomas, and Elizabeth, all of a very tender age.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hanway, thus deprived of her pro|tector and &s;upport, and left to rear up a young family by her own exertions, remov|ed with her children to London; and &s;uch was her maternal care and affection for them, that Mr. Hanway never &s;poke or wrote of his mother, but in terms of the highe&s;t reverence and gratitude.</P>
<P>William, in the early part of his life, had an appointment in the Navy-office. Thomas, pur&s;uing his father's profe&s;&s;ion, in 1742 ob|tained a captain's commi&s;&s;ion, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;ome engagements on the coa&s;t of Scotland in 1745, and in the two prin|cipal engagements of the &s;ucceeding war with France and Spain. He married the beauti|ful
<PB N="4" REF="15">
Mi&s;s Ann Howe, of a very re&s;pectable family in the north of England. In 1756, he was appointed commander in chief of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips at Plymouth, and in 1761 commi&s;&s;ioner of the dock-yard at Chatham, which po&s;t he retained till 1771, when finding his health to decline, he re&s;igned his tru&s;t, and came with his lady to his brother Jonas's hou&s;e in Red-Lion-Square, where he died the next year, leaving his widow, beautiful even at the age of &s;ixty, behind him. She died about eight years after her hu&s;band of the &s;mall-pox. Elizabeth was married, fir&s;t to Captain Worledge, and, after his death, to Mr. Town&s;end, and died in 1770.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Hanway's ance&s;tors there is but little remarkable: They were of moderate fortune, re&s;pectable profe&s;&s;ions, and fair character. His uncle, by the father's &s;ide, Major John Hanway, was a man of wit and gallantry: He tran&s;lated &s;everal of the odes, &s;atires, and epi&s;tles of Horace, and
<PB N="5" REF="16">
the works of other Latin poets; and was the author of &s;ome original ver&s;es in that language.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>His talent for tran&s;lation and compo&s;ition, may be judged of by the following &s;pecimens, taken from his book, dedicated to Thomas Vi&s;count Wind&s;or, of which I have &s;een but one copy.</P>

&s;eventeen he went over to Li&s;bon, where he arrived in June, 1729, and was bound ap|prentice to a merchant in that city.</P>
<P>His early life was marked with that di&s;|creet attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, and love of neatne&s;s and regularity, which di&s;tingui&s;hed his future character. At Li&s;bon his affec|tions were captivated by a lady, then cele|brated for her beauty and mental accom|pli&s;hments; but &s;he preferring another for her hu&s;band, returned to England, and &s;pent the latter part of her life in London with her family, on terms of friend&s;hip with Mr. Hanway.</P>
<P>On the expiration of Mr. Hanway's ap|prentice&s;hip, he entered into bu&s;ine&s;s at Li&s;bon as a merchant or factor; but did not remain there long before he returned to London. From the time of his arrival in London, to the year 1743, when he went over with intention to &s;ettle at St. Peter&s;|burgh, nothing remarkable happened. He
<PB N="8" REF="19">
was not indeed in this period, nor in any other part of his long life, inactive: As commerce was his profe&s;&s;ion, he pur&s;ued it with an arduous and indefatigable atten|tion, and the &s;tricte&s;t regard to honour and integrity; but in 1743, he entered into an engagement which totally changed the cour&s;e of his life; and was attended with occur|rences truly remarkable. He had hitherto appeared only in the familiar light of a merchant; but we are now to view him in a new &s;ituation and a new character: to &s;ee with what per&s;everance and addre&s;s he con|ducts him&s;elf amid&s;t dangers and difficulties, not only new to him&s;elf, but &s;uch as fall to the lot of very few to encounter.</P>
<P>It is at this period that his "Travels" commence; and I flatter my&s;elf the relation of this part of his life will be particularly acceptable, even to tho&s;e who were not ac|quainted with him. The&s;e Travels, although they went through four editions, have been
<PB N="9" REF="20">
long out of print. It has been in contem|plation to reprint them; but the worn out condition of the plates, and the expence of two large quarto volumes, have been formi|dable ob&s;tacles. I &s;hall therefore endeavour to give a plain narrative of the mo&s;t material occurrences, omitting tho&s;e parts of the work which do not immediately relate to him&s;elf; and as the &s;cene of the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions was principally on the Ca&s;pian Sea, and the borders thereof, a chart is annexed of that va&s;t lake, reduced from the original chart pre&s;ented to Mr. Hanway by Captain Woodrooffe, his fellow traveller, which was taken by order of Nadir Shah, the Per&s;ian monarch: And to render the relation yet more intelligible, there is traced thereon the rout from Yerkie, at the north-we&s;t end of the Ca&s;pian, to Langarood, at the oppo&s;ite extremity; from thence to A&s;trabad, at the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner, the place where his mi&s;|fortunes began, and from thence towards
<PB N="10" REF="21">
the camp of the <HI>Shah</HI>, and his return to Yerkie.</P>
<P>In February, 1743, Mr. Hanway accepted the offer of a partner&s;hip in the hou&s;e of Mr. Dingley, a merchant, at St. Peter&s;burgh; and embarking in the river Thames in the April following, he arrived at St. Peter&s;|burgh the tenth of June. Here he fir&s;t be|came acquainted with the Ca&s;pian trade, then in its infancy, and entertained an ardent de&s;ire to &s;ee Per&s;ia, a country &s;o renowned for extraordinary events in ancient and modern times.</P>
<P>As the trade to Per&s;ia has been attended with circum&s;tances &s;omewhat remarkable, and is connected with the &s;ubject of Mr. Hanway's adventures in that country, &s;ome account of it is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The opening a trade through Ru&s;&s;ia into Per&s;ia, had, ever &s;ince the di&s;covery of Archangel by the Engli&s;h, been con&s;idered as capable of procuring many advantages
<PB N="11" REF="22">
to this country; and attempts were made very early to effect it, but without any con|&s;iderable progre&s;s. In 1738, John Elton, an Engli&s;h &s;eaman, of a mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing genius, and who had &s;pent four years among the roving Tartars, who inhabit the va&s;t and uncultivated countries which lie be|tween Bokhara, and the we&s;tern boundaries of Siberia, made a propo&s;al to &s;ome Briti&s;h factors at St. Peter&s;burgh, to introduce a trade through Ru&s;&s;ia into Per&s;ia, by way of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and repre&s;ented that the only tolerably &s;afe way was down the river Volga, and along the Ca&s;pian to A&s;trabad, or &s;ome other port near the &s;outh-ea&s;t extre|mity of that &s;ea, and from thence to Me&s;|ched, the then favourite city of the Per&s;ian monarch; from which place he conceived it practicable to extend it to the northern cities of the Mogul's empire.</P>
<P>Mr. Elton's propo&s;al being accepted by the factors, in the beginning of the year
<PB N="12" REF="23">
1739 he &s;at out from St. Peter&s;burgh with a cargo of goods, and, after encountering many difficulties, arrived at Re&s;hd, a city or principal town near the &s;outh-we&s;t extremity of the Ca&s;pian, where, finding protection from the Shah's regent, he &s;old his cargo at a good price, without proceeding to Me&s;|ched as he originally intended; and after having obtained a decree of the regent in favour of the new trade, he returned to St. Peter&s;burgh.</P>
<P>In 1741, an act of the Briti&s;h parliament pa&s;&s;ed in favour of the trade, obtained in a great mea&s;ure by the repre&s;entations made by Mr. Elton to the honourable Mr. Fynch, at that time his Britannick Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ter at St. Peter&s;burgh; and in 1742 Mr. Elton went again into Per&s;ia, commander of one of two &s;hips built by the factors for the more effectually carrying into execution their plan; but actuated by ambition, or di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;ome part of his principals' con|duct,
<PB N="13" REF="24">
he de&s;erted the cau&s;e he was engaged in, and entered into the &s;ervice of the u&s;urper Nadir Shah, as <Q>&startq;Superintendant of &endq;the Per&s;ian coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian," with de|&s;ign to build &s;hips in the European manner, for the navigation of that &s;ea.</Q></P>
<P>This de&s;ertion of the principal agent in the de&s;ign gave great offence to the Ru&s;&s;ian court, and alarmed the factors &s;o much, that they determined to &s;end one of their com|pany into Per&s;ia, to &s;uperintend the trade; and Mr. Hanway, on his own voluntary offer, was agreed on as the per&s;on. His known integrity and per&s;everance, joined to the intere&s;t he had in the trade, gave the other factors great hopes of &s;ucce&s;s through his means; and they tru&s;ted their enterpri&s;e to his conduct with implicit confidence.</P>
<P>On the tenth of September, 1743, after making the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;ition for his journey, he &s;at out from St. Peter&s;burgh, with an interpreter, who had been before
<PB N="14" REF="25">
in that part of Per&s;ia into which he was going, a clerk, a Ru&s;&s;ian menial &s;ervant, a Tartar boy, and a guard; having under his care a caravan of thirty-&s;even bales of Engli&s;h cloth, making twenty carriage loads, and arrived at Mo&s;cow in ten days from his departure, the di&s;tance being 734 wer&s;ts, or 487 Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is too much the cu&s;tom in Ru&s;&s;ia for officers, or per&s;ons who travel with &s;er|vants or &s;oldiers, to treat the pea&s;ants with &endq;in&s;olence;</Q> but the fir&s;t charge Mr. Han|way gave his attendants was, to avoid every occa&s;ion of di&s;pute, and &s;till more of op|pre&s;&s;ion; and that if any in&s;ult was offered to them, they &s;hould inform him, that he might judge in what manner it ought to be re&s;ented.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of September, hav|ing repaired his waggons, and provided ne|ce&s;&s;aries, he left Mo&s;cow; and on the &s;e|venth
<PB N="15" REF="26">
day after, he entered the Step,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The common name in Ru&s;&s;ia for a de&s;ert.</NOTE> and arrived, October the ninth, at Zaritzen, a city on the we&s;tern banks of the Volga, 688 Engli&s;h miles di&s;tant from Mo&s;cow. On his arrival at this place, he endeavoured to procure a ve&s;&s;el which &s;hould carry his caravan down the Volga to A&s;trachan, the metropolis of a province &s;ituate on the other &s;ide the river, within the limits of A&s;ia, at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty Engli&s;h miles from its di&s;emboguement into the Ca&s;pian &s;ea; and having hired a ve&s;&s;el of the kind in u&s;e on that river, with proper per&s;ons to navigate her, he left Zaritzen the eighth of November, and proceeded on his voyage.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The river Volga (anciently called the &endq;Rha) is," &s;ays Mr. Hanway, &startq;for extent one of the noble&s;t in the world: it derives its &s;ource from the lake Fernoff, in the province of Re&s;koff, running, according to
<PB N="16" REF="27">
general computation, near 3000 Engli&s;h miles before it empties it&s;elf into the Ca&s;|pian. The immen&s;e quantities of water which this river receives from others, and from many hilly countries, from whence de&s;cend great torrents, particularly when the &s;now melts in the Spring, are the cau&s;e of its &s;welling at different times and places. The &s;ailors who navigate this river, are remarkable for their dexterity in <HI>warping</HI>. They have three boats to carry out the warps, which they take in forward, and at the &s;ame time they coil the warp from the &s;tern into the boat, while the other two boats are a-head lay|ing fre&s;h warps. The ve&s;&s;els &s;ometimes carry from 150 to 200 men; and as their bigne&s;s prevents their &s;ailing, except the wind be very fair, they warp thirty miles a day again&s;t the &s;tream, which is &endq;very rapid."</Q></P>
<P>The danger of this voyage down the
<PB N="17" REF="28">
Volga will appear, when the nature of the country, and the &s;tructure of the ve&s;&s;els are known. The Ru&s;&s;ian government autho|rizing va&s;&s;allage, and giving one man a pro|perty in the per&s;on and labour of another, no va&s;&s;al can leave the dominions of his lord without his permi&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t re|turn home, no matter how far off, or how difficult the journey, by the time limited: Tho&s;e who fail, dreading the &s;evere puni&s;h|ment which awaits them, frequently turn pirates; and, joining them&s;elves to the <HI>Khal|muck Tartars</HI>, rob on the river. They go in gangs of thirty, forty, or even eighty per&s;ons, in row-boats, equipped with fire arms; and their piracy is commonly attend|ed with the murder of the unfortunate who fall into their hands. The puni&s;hment in|flicted on the&s;e wretches, when taken, is &s;uitable to the cruelties they practi&s;e on others: A float is built, with a gallows erected thereon, and they are &s;tripped naked, and
<PB N="18" REF="29">
with their hands pinioned behind, hung up by the ribs on hooks, and &s;et afloat on the river; and it is a capital offence for any per&s;on to relieve or put an end, by death, to their tortures. They remain alive, in this dreadful &s;ituation, three, four, and &s;ometimes five days, imploring water with the greate&s;t ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, and appear to die in a raging fever.</P>
<P>The Khalmucks do not &s;ow or reap, or make hay for their cattle, which are hor&s;es, camels, cows, and &s;heep. The men live without bread or vegetables, and in the winter their cattle fare as wild bea&s;ts do. Their food is fle&s;h, that of hor&s;es being pre|ferred, fi&s;h, wild fowl, and veni&s;on, with milk, pre&s;erved in various ways; but mare's milk is mo&s;t e&s;teemed among them, and from it they extract a &s;trong &s;pirit, of which they are exceeding fond.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bruce.</NOTE></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the ve&s;&s;els in u&s;e on this river, they are without knees, have but few

beams, and their decks are only loo&s;e pieces of bark. In place of tar, &s;lips of bark are nailed over the &s;eams, to prevent the caulking from falling out.</P>
<P>On board one of the&s;e fragile ve&s;&s;els, on the fourteenth of October, Mr. Hanway embarked on this va&s;t river. He was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee the banks marked in &s;ome places twenty feet above the water; but was told by the boatmen that the river ro&s;e in &s;pring to that height. On the nineteenth he ar|rived at A&s;trachan, where he was courte|ou&s;ly received by Mr. Thomp&s;on, agent at that place to the Briti&s;h merchants trading to Per&s;ia; and after remaining about three weeks, and procuring all the information he could of the voyage along the Ca&s;pian, he left A&s;trachan, and fell down to Yerkie, at the mouth of the Volga, the place where all ve&s;&s;els take their departure from, and which they endeavour to make on their re|turn.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31">The Ca&s;pian &s;ea, at which he was now arrived,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account of the Ca&s;pian is not taken from Mr. Hanway's de&s;cription of it alone; but with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other &s;urveys (particularly that made by order of the Czar Peter), and a manu&s;cript account of it &s;ent to Mr. Hanway in London, after the publication of his Travels.</NOTE> extends (from Yaeck, in 46 deg. 15 min. north latitude, to A&s;trabad, which is in 36 deg. 50 min.) 9 deg. 25 min. or 646 Engli&s;h miles; its breadth is very various, and its circumference has been mea&s;ured to 3525 wer&s;ts. The water of the Ca&s;pian is as &s;alt as that of the ocean; but as the moon mu&s;t have its influence, on a water compa|ratively &s;o &s;mall as this, equally on all its parts at the &s;ame time, there is no tide. At Derbend, on the we&s;tern &s;ide, there was formerly a watering place; but it has &s;ince been inundated. Shamakie is the mo&s;t po|pulous city in the&s;e parts, having factories from the ea&s;tern nations, which occa&s;ions it to be much re&s;orted to.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="32">From the coa&s;t on this &s;ide the Ca&s;pian may be plainly &s;een the high mountains of Cauca&s;us. The mountains of Taurus and Ararat are &s;o contiguous, as to appear like a continuation of the &s;ame mountain; but Ararat is one va&s;t rock, exceeding Cau|ca&s;us in height: Its top is covered with &s;now throughout the year. The Arme|nians, who call it Me&s;&s;ina, pretend that there are &s;till &s;ome remains of the Ark, which they &s;ay re&s;ted here after the deluge; but that by the length of time they are become petrified.</P>
<P>At Baku is &s;een, what the Per&s;ians call "The Everla&s;ting Fire," an object of their devotion, and a phoenomenon of a very &s;ur|pri&s;ing nature: About ten miles from the city are &s;everal ancient &s;mall temples, about fifteen feet high; in one of the&s;e, where the Indians now wor&s;hip, is a large cane fixed in the earth, about three feet remaining in &s;ight, from the end of which i&s;&s;ues a blue flame,
<PB N="22" REF="33">
not unlike that of a lamp burning with &s;pi|rits, but &s;eemingly more pure. Here are generally forty or fifty poor devotees, who come on a pilgrimage, to make expiation for their own &s;ins, and the &s;ins of their countrymen, and they continue the longer, according to the number of per&s;ons for whom they have engaged to pray.</P>
<P>A little way from the temple is a cleft in the rock, about &s;ix feet long and three broad, out of which i&s;&s;ues a con&s;tant pure flame; when the wind blows it ri&s;es &s;ometimes eight feet high, but is much lower in &s;till weather.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The earth for above two miles round this place, has this &s;urpri&s;ing property, that by taking up two or three inches of the &s;urface, and applying a live coal, the part which is &s;o uncovered immediately takes fire. If a cane or tube, even of paper, be &s;et about two inches in the ground, and the top of it touched with fire, immedi|ately

a flame i&s;&s;ues without hurting the &endq;cane or paper."</Q></P>
<P>The river Kura or Cyrus, which is joined by the river Araxis, is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable river on the we&s;tern coa&s;t. Not far from Ke&s;lar &s;tands the mountain Barmach, re|markable for the oil called Naptha, which i&s;&s;ues from it into thirty different pits, all within the compa&s;s of a mu&s;quet &s;hot of each other. The river Oxus, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, is now about a mu&s;quet &s;hot broad at its mouth. The lake or gulph Karaboga&s;ki is about two wer&s;ts broad at its inlet: Some people concluded that as the Ca&s;pian is never found to ri&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e quantities of water that fall into it from the rivers and hills at the melting of the &s;now, that the water had an outlet in this gulph; but the gulph is as calm as any part of the &s;ea. The country near this coa&s;t from near A&s;trabad to Kulalie, the boundary of Turku|mania, is inhabited by rude and inho&s;pitable
<PB N="24" REF="35">
Tartars, with whom no commerce has been had. The river Yaek is about 100 fathoms broad. The &s;hore from this river to Yer|kie is very &s;hallow and over-grown with reeds for &s;ome miles into the &s;ea. In the&s;e reeds are bred an innumerable quantity of water fowls of various de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>November the twenty-&s;econd, Mr. Han|way embarked on board the <HI>Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>, one of the two &s;hips built by the factors, commanded by Captain Woodrooffe, and was much plea&s;ed to find him&s;elf in a good ve&s;&s;el, regularly built, and, probably, the fir&s;t complete &s;hip which had appeared on the Ca&s;pian. They &s;ailed from Yerkie, and traver&s;ing the whole length of the &s;ea from north to &s;outh, arrived, December the third, at Langarood, a bay at the &s;outh-we&s;t extremity of the Ca&s;pian, the then re&s;idence of Captain Elton, by whom he was kindly received; and after having remained &s;even days with him, he &s;et &s;ail for A&s;trabad, in
<PB N="25" REF="36">
the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner of the Ca&s;pian. As they &s;teered ea&s;tward, the &s;ky brightened, and the air, which had before been cold and wet, became gentle and warm. They were four days in &s;ight of the great Peak or mountain Demoan; which, although &s;aid to be thirty leagues within land, they could di&s;tingui&s;h very plain at the di&s;tance of four or five leagues from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth of December they ar|rived in the bay of A&s;trabad. Here, as in other parts of the Ca&s;pian, the &s;ea had made great inroads: Many trunks of trees lay on the &s;hore, and made it difficult of acce&s;s. They anchored at half a league di&s;tance from the land, and Mr. Hanway di&s;patched the Armenian, to inquire if the goods might be landed with &s;afety; but he returned un|able to procure any information. The people on the coa&s;t having been frequently plundered by the Ogurtjoy and Ru&s;&s;ian pirates, and &s;eeing &s;o large a ve&s;&s;el in their
<PB N="26" REF="37">
road, were under great apprehen&s;ions for their own &s;afety.</P>
<P>On the twentieth, however, Mr. Han|way went on &s;hore. The &s;tumps of the trees and &s;hallows made it difficult for a long-boat to land nearer than twenty yards. Having &s;atisfied the people that they were friends, he was received by them on the &s;hore, and conducted, by many crooked paths through a thick wood, to a &s;mall vil|lage. He &s;ent the interpreter to the city, which was about eight hours di&s;tant, to pay his re&s;pects to Mahommed Zamon Beg, the governor of A&s;trabad, and to reque&s;t his protection. In the evening the me&s;&s;enger returned: The governor promi&s;ed his pro|tection; but charged Mr. Hanway, in a very particular manner, not to repo&s;e any confidence in the pea&s;ants on the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the &s;hip remained in the bay, &s;he was in &s;ome danger of being burned: A quantity of raw cotton which lay in the
<PB N="27" REF="38">
&s;teerage, and was intended for the repackage of the bales of cloth in a proper man|ner for camel and hor&s;e carriage, was &s;et on fire by the carele&s;sne&s;s of one of the &s;eamen; but was with &s;ome difficulty extingui&s;hed before the fire reached the powder che&s;t.</P>
<P>At night the woods on the mountains took fire, and the wind feeding the flame, made a dreadful blaze, which extended &s;e|veral miles, and by its heat made the butter on board the &s;hip run like oil: The accident proved to have been occa&s;ioned by burning ru&s;hes on the coa&s;t, to de&s;troy the in&s;ects which breed in them.</P>
<P>And now having accompanied Mr. Han|way till his &s;afe arrival in Per&s;ia, it will not be improper to inquire into the &s;tate of that kingdom.</P>
<P>Per&s;ia is bounded by the mountains of Ararat on the north-we&s;t; by the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, which divides it from Ru&s;&s;ia, on the north; by the river in Oxus, which devides it
<PB N="28" REF="39">
from U&s;beck Tartary, on the north-ea&s;t; by India on the ea&s;t, and by the Indian ocean, and the gulphs of Per&s;ia and Ormus on the &s;outh, and by Arabia and Turkey on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>In the year 1402, Tamerlane, the Tar|tar chief, having &s;ubdued Per&s;ia, died, leav|ing a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings till 1500, after which the family of the Seffies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne for the &s;pace of about 220 years, until Maghmud, an Afghan chief, taking advantage of the indolence and timidity of Shah Sultan Hu&s;&s;ein, the la&s;t prince of that family, procured him&s;elf to be &s;eated on the throne.</P>
<P>Maghmud reigned until 1725, when he was in his turn depo&s;ed and murdered by A&s;hreff, who &s;ucceeded him in the diadem; and on the fifteenth of January, 1730, A&s;h|reff was defeated in a pitched battle by the famous Tehmas Nadir Kouli, who had been rai&s;ed to the rank of general to the legiti|mate
<PB N="29" REF="40">
heir of Hu&s;&s;ein. In 1736 Nadir pro|cured him&s;elf to be crowned Shah or king, under the title of Nadir Shah.</P>
<P>The father of this famous u&s;urper was an ob&s;cure Tartar, who procured a &s;canty &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence by making &s;heep-&s;kin coats; and when he died, Nadir was u&s;ed to gather &s;ticks in the woods, and carry them to market on an a&s;s, and a camel, which were his only patrimony. He was afterwards a robber; then a courier in the &s;ervice of a Beg; and by the mo&s;t enormous ambition, treachery, and murders, obtained the diadem and the complete conque&s;t of the Per&s;ians, whom he ruled with the greate&s;t rigour, oppre&s;&s;ion, and cruelty; depriving them of their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and even lives, with unexampled wantonne&s;s, and &s;preading de&s;olation and mi&s;ery all around him.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of this fruitful, and once &s;plendid country, when Mr. Hanway arrived with his caravan in the city of A&s;trabad.
<PB N="30" REF="41">
Whil&s;t he was employed in repacking his goods in a way proper for land carriage, he had opportunities of conver&s;ing with the in|habitants on the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the coun|try, and the pro&s;pect before him. The Ar|menian interpreter, who had before been robbed near Me&s;ched, now began to expre&s;s fears of the danger they &s;hould be expo&s;ed to in the journey to that city; but as he had before been &s;ilent, and did not now point out any particular danger, Mr. Hanway did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to pay great at|tention to his repre&s;entations.</P>
<P>On the fifth he prepared to wait on the governor; and having no equipage to make a proper appearance, Na&s;eer Aga, in who&s;e hou&s;e he was lodged, lent him a hor&s;e hand|&s;omely capari&s;oned, and in&s;i&s;ted on his taking his &s;ervants to attend him as well as his own. The pre&s;ent to the governor, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal cuts of fine cloth, and &s;ome loaves of &s;ugar, was carried in before him. On
<PB N="31" REF="42">
his entrance, he found the governor attend|ed by many per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction in the city, among whom were Mahommed Ha&s;&s;an Beg, &s;on of the late Fately Ali Khan Khajar, who had been put to death by Na|dir, Mahommed Khan Beg, and Sadoc Aga, the two la&s;t the &s;ons of Khans in high fa|vour with the Shah. <Q>They all ro&s;e up at his coming in, and the governor bade him welcome to Per&s;ia, adding, in the true ea&s;t|ern &s;tyle of compliment, &startq;that the city of A&s;trabad was now his to do what he plea&s;|ed &endq;with it."</Q> To this a &s;uitable an&s;wer was made on the part of Mr. Hanway, who re|que&s;ted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection; and after &s;ome further di&s;cour&s;e, in which the governor a&s;&s;ured him the pa&s;&s;age to Me&s;ched from thence was perfectly &s;afe, and promi&s;ed to &s;end &s;ome of his &s;oldiers to e&s;cort him thither, Mr. Hanway took his leave.</P>
<P>Na&s;eer Aga, of who&s;e humanity and po|litene&s;s he had received &s;uch &s;ignal proof,
<PB N="32" REF="43">
was now a venerable old man, of a &s;erious but inviting a&s;pect. He had been the com|panion of Nadir, when he was the chief of a band of robbers in the neighbouring moun|tains; but he was too good a man for Na|dir's purpo&s;e; and the mediocrity of his fortune, and his want of ambition, had &s;e|cured him from the calamities which u&s;ually fell on &s;uch of Nadir's favourites, as pro|fe&s;&s;ed any regard to ju&s;tice or con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Having agreed for camels and hor&s;es to carry his merchandize, with &s;ome difficulty on account of the mercenary and deceitful temper of the natives, he prepared to &s;et forward on his journey to Me&s;ched; but the drivers, &s;ome days after their agreement, re|pre&s;ented that, as the camels could not keep pace with the hor&s;es, it would be advi&s;able to load and &s;end them off &s;ome days before he departed him&s;elf with the hor&s;es. It was with great reluctance that he con&s;ented to the &s;eparation of his company, e&s;pecially as
<PB N="33" REF="44">
the behaviour of the drivers gave him no very favourable idea of their fidelity; but urged by the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and the repre&s;entations of his new friend Na&s;eer Aga, he con&s;ented to load forty bales on ten camels, and &s;ent them forward, fixing four days after for his own departure with the re&s;t of the merchandize on the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>He then made another vi&s;it to the gover|nor, who, to his great mortification, behaved to him in a very di&s;tant manner, and ac|quainted him that he could &s;pare but one &s;oldier to e&s;cort him: His mind ap|peared to be clouded with &s;ome great per|plexity, which as Mr. Hanway could not develope, he took his leave, without think|ing very deeply about it.</P>
<P>The day after that on which the forty bales of cloth had been &s;ent away, the city of A&s;trabad was alarmed with the rumour of an in&s;urrection of the neighbouring people: Signals were made to call the inha|bitants
<PB N="34" REF="45">
and their cattle within the walls; the &s;hops were &s;hut, and the men prepared for defence. It appeared that Mahommed Ha&s;&s;an Beg had left the city in &s;ecret, and now ap|peared in arms at the head of a party of the provincials with an auxiliary body of Turkuman Tartars, declaring that they meant to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Shah's trea&s;ure, which was then lodged in the city, and of the European, goods; and to further their ra&s;h de&s;igns, they gave out that the Shah was dead.</P>
<P>A city be&s;ieged and incapable of defence, a weak and faithle&s;s garri&s;on, and the gene|ral report that the Turkuman Tartars were the mo&s;t &s;avage of the human race, and would, in all probability, put Mr. Hanway to the &s;word, were circum&s;tances of no com|mon apprehen&s;ion. His attendants advi&s;ed him to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf in a Per&s;ian habit, and e&s;cape from the city; but as he was at a di&s;tance from the bay, and if he &s;hould
<PB N="35" REF="46">
be able to reach it, the &s;hip would probably have failed, he determined to remain with his merchandize in the city, in his proper cha|racter, which he was be&s;t able to &s;upport, and in which, if it &s;hould be &s;o decreed, he thought it mo&s;t honourable to die.</P>
<P>The da&s;tardly governor had already fled from the city, di&s;gui&s;ed like a pea&s;ant, and mounted behind a real pea&s;ant. Tho&s;e among the inhabitants who were not inclin|ed to commotion, now cur&s;ed Mr. Hanway as the cau&s;e of their misfortune, by bring|ing &s;o valuable a caravan into the city, to attract the avarice of the rebels.</P>
<P>Nothing can di&s;play a man's character for courage and addre&s;s more truly than his behaviour in a &s;ituation like this, becau&s;e it has danger enough to prevent every kind of artificial deportment; and Mr. Hanway's conduct at this juncture was &s;uch as he could always after reflect on with plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. After making,
<PB N="36" REF="47">
with great deliberation, the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ervants and effects to receive the in|vaders, whom he &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t, he directed a watch to be kept all night, that he might not be &s;urpri&s;ed. In the evening he retired to his apartment, to pre|pare his own mind for any event that might happen; and as it was his u&s;ual practice to commit all his material thoughts to writing, he entered in his journal a prayer to this effect:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;O God, thou ha&s;t been my &s;uccour through all the perils and vici&s;&s;itudes of my life: If it is thy good plea&s;ure yet to pre&s;erve that life, let all my future hopes, and all my wi&s;hes, centre in thee alone. Let the remembrance of thy mercies in|&s;pire my mind with the mo&s;t ardent love, the mo&s;t exalted gratitude. Let the ten|der laws of humanity ever po&s;&s;e&s;s my &s;oul. But if it is thy will that I now render back this vital heat which &s;prang
<PB N="37" REF="48">
from thee: if thy gracious providence has ordained that my life be now brought to an end by the&s;e unthinking men; thy will be done: Avert, O Lord, the de|&s;truction that threatens them, and lay not my blood to their charge! Succour me in the &s;ecret paths of death, and re|ceive me into the glory, which thou ha&s;t &endq;prepared for thy &s;ervants."</Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e meditations he retired to re&s;t, and was awaked at four in the morning, after a &s;leep of five hours, by a &s;mart but ir|regular fire of mu&s;quetry. A &s;ilence en|&s;ued, and the city was given up to Mahom|med Ha&s;&s;an Beg. Noi&s;e and merriment &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the &s;pirits of the in&s;urgents: They &s;eized the city drums; and a large party went about beating them, and hallooing. Zadoc Aga, who was now ap|pointed a Sirdar or general, with Mahommed Khan Beg, both young men of more fire than judgment, headed a party of men, and came
<PB N="38" REF="49">
to the hou&s;e in which Mr. Hanway re&s;ided. He had collected his attendants in a room together, from whence he &s;ent the Tartar boy to conduct the&s;e ho&s;tile vi&s;itors to him. He entreated them that, as he was now at their mercy, they would behave to him with humanity. They declared they did not mean to hurt his per&s;on; but on the con|trary, as &s;oon as ever <HI>their government</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed, they would pay for the goods which they then &s;eized, and informed him the forty bales, &s;ent out laden on the camels, were already in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>"As gold," &s;ays Mr. Hanway on this oc|ca&s;ion, &startq;can purcha&s;e every thing, except virtue and wealth, under&s;tanding and beauty; when my money was demanded, I re&s;erved a pur&s;e of 160 crowns in gold, thinking it might admini&s;ter to our &s;afe|ty:" &endq;but he &s;oon found that his &s;ecurity was in his &s;uppo&s;ed poverty; for in three
<PB N="39" REF="50">
weeks di&s;tre&s;s which &s;ucceeded, he dur&s;t not &s;hew a &s;ingle piece of gold.</Q></P>
<P>Some days after two Turkuman chiefs were introduced to him by the newly made governor Baba Zadoc, who a&s;ked the Per|&s;ians in his hearing: <Q>&startq;You give us the merchandize of the Ru&s;&s;ians, will you not give us the Ru&s;&s;ians al&s;o? They will &endq;do well to tend our &s;heep!"</Q> They were pacified by the natives; but the knowledge this gave Mr. Hanway of their di&s;po&s;ition, determined him to quit the place as &s;oon as any opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf. Se|veral of the Turkumans, at different times, intruded them&s;elves into his hou&s;e, pre|tending a curio&s;ity to &s;ee him; but he afterwards learned, their real intention was to con&s;ult by what means they might carry him off.</P>
<P>The perplexity he ob&s;erved in the coun|cils and conduct of the in&s;urgents, joined to the knowledge he had of the force and
<PB N="40" REF="51">
di&s;po&s;ition of the Shah, gave him very un|favourable pre&s;ages of their approaching fate; and he was firmly of opinion their reign could continue but a very &s;hort time. Every way, however, he &s;aw danger threatening him&s;elf: If they retreated from the city, they might carry him with them into the inho&s;pitable de&s;erts of Turkumania, or de&s;troy him for their own convenience or &s;afety; and if they &s;ucceeded, the Turku|man party would increa&s;e, and he might be carried a &s;lave into their country.</P>
<P>But even in the&s;e perturbed times, there were not wanting &s;ome among the inhabi|tants of A&s;trabad, who&s;e love of ju&s;tice and humanity convinced them that, what|ever motives they might have to rebel again&s;t the Shah, they had no right to rob a &s;tran|ger; and &s;ome of the&s;e gave him informa|tion, and even a&s;&s;i&s;ted, as far as was &s;afe, in his pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>After experiencing much of the in&s;ulta,
<PB N="41" REF="52">
and wanton cruelty, of the rebels, he de|termined to leave A&s;trabad at all events, although its environs were infe&s;ted with flying parties of the Tartars, and &s;eek the protection of the Shah, who was reported to be near Ghilan with his army. This in|tention he thought it advi&s;able to conceal with the utmo&s;t precaution; but he directed his interpreter to deliver to Mahommed Ha&s;&s;an Beg, an account of the value of the goods, and to demand a bill for the amount; which he obtained of him, and an engagement to provide ten armed men to e&s;cort him to Ghilan.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of January he left A&s;trabad under convoy of a Hahdgee,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a general title be&s;towed on all who have made a pilgrimage to Mecca.</NOTE> who had been introduced to him by Na&s;eer Aga on his fir&s;t arrival, his brother and two &s;ons, and about twenty armed villagers; and ar|rived, after a few days journey, at a &s;mall
<PB N="42" REF="53">
town belonging to the Hahdgee. His bro|ther, who&s;e character did not appear to be very amiable, would have conducted him to his hou&s;e, which he &s;aid was in the ad|jacent mountains; but he had experienced too much of Per&s;ian infidelity to tru&s;t him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;ituation. The Hahdgee, who had been acquainted with the circum&s;tances of the rebellion at the time of Mr. Han|way's fir&s;t arrival, and &s;educed him to remain in the city, merely that he might partake in the &s;poil of his effects, &s;uppo&s;ing that he was yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome things of value, thought it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with his intere&s;t to &s;uffer him to carry them off; and he exerted all the cunning of his country to obtain them. He even declared the car|riers &s;hould not proceed, unle&s;s Mr. Hanway left his baggage with him; and he was con|&s;trained to deliver up the gro&s;s thereof, tak|ing care to conceal about his per&s;on as much of value as was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="54">They then proceeded on their journey, through pathle&s;s woods, over ditches and hills, taking care to keep the lea&s;t frequented way, and lying in the open fields. In their way they pa&s;&s;ed by the ruins of the palace of Farabad, once famous for the re&s;idence of the Per&s;ian kings. The carriers had en|gaged to conduct him to Balfru&s;h, the capital of the province of Me&s;anderan; but hear|ing that the Shah's admiral was levying forces to oppo&s;e the A&s;trabad rebels, they re|fu&s;ed to proceed any further. He reque&s;ted they would at lea&s;t convey him to a place where hor&s;es or &s;ome other cattle might be procured; but this al&s;o they refu&s;ed, alledg|ing that he was near the coa&s;t, and might go by &s;ea. Accordingly, they conducted him and his attendants to a fi&s;herman's hut, on the &s;ea coa&s;t: The poor man had only an open boat, like a canoe, very leaky, and too &s;mall for &s;ix per&s;ons; be&s;ides it could be navigated only with oars or paddles near the
<PB N="44" REF="55">
&s;hore, where the &s;urf then ran very high; and the &s;and banks forming breakers, made the &s;ea &s;till more dangerous. He, therefore, again implored the carriers to furni&s;h hor&s;es according to their engagement, but they treated his reque&s;t with contempt. He threatened to u&s;e force; whereupon two of them, being armed with matchlocks, lighted their matches, two others had bows and arrows, and all of them, being &s;ix in num|ber, had &s;abres. Mr. Hanway collected his company, among whom were four mu&s;|quets, a blunderbu&s;s, and a pair of pi&s;tols; but as he could not depend on more than two of his &s;ervants, after a &s;hort parley, he &s;ubmitted to run the ri&s;k of being drowned, rather than engage in a fray, where no other advantage could be obtained, than the preca|rious u&s;e of hor&s;es, through a country ut|terly unknown to him.</P>
<P>Tru&s;ting, therefore, to Providence, he em|barked in the boat with his &s;ervants; and
<PB N="45" REF="56">
with much fatigue and danger, favoured by the winds, he arrived &s;afe at Te&s;chidezar, in the next province; and learning that the Shah's officers were there collecting their forces, he begged their protection; and the chief &s;ent him a hor&s;e hand&s;omely capari|&s;oned, with four mules for his &s;ervants; and on the thirtieth he arrived at Balfru&s;h, where he was a&s;&s;ured by the Per&s;ian mer|chants, that the Shah would certainly make good his lo&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was this e&s;cape which gave Mr. Hanway the fir&s;t idea of his motto. When he returned to England, he had painted on his chariot, a man dre&s;&s;ed in the Per|&s;ian habit, ju&s;t landed in a &s;torm on a rude coa&s;t, and leaning on his &s;word, his countenance calm and re|&s;igned. In the back ground was depicted a boat, beat about by the billows; in front, a &s;hield charged with his arms leaning again&s;t a tree, and underneath, the motto in Engli&s;h, "NEVER DESPAIR."</NOTE> Mahommed Khan, the ad|miral, told him he might think him&s;elf for|tunate in having e&s;caped with life; and re|commended to him to continue his rout by water to Ghilan; and, indeed, &s;o unable

was the force at that time with the admiral to oppo&s;e the Tartars, who were now in the neighbourhood, that they all prepared for flight, and Mr. Hanway &s;aw that he had no alternative but to wait and receive his conquerors a &s;econd time, or to depart un|protected, without guides or attendants. He applied to Mahommed Khan for hor&s;es, who promi&s;ed to &s;upply him; but, after many prevarications, &s;ent him one mortally di&s;tempered, and exceedingly poor in fle&s;h. He was in &s;ome doubt whether he &s;hould accept the bea&s;t; but at length he determin|ed on his mode of proceeding: He took an affectionate leave of his interpreter and &s;er|vants; and leaving with them the rebels' pa&s;&s;port, and what money he could &s;pare, he recommended them to the protection of Providence, and &s;at out alone on his journey. The Tartars were entering the city at one gate, when he went out at the other. After &s;ome time, he fell in with a party, who con|ducted
<PB N="47" REF="58">
the baggage of the admiral, and him&s;elf &s;oon followed; but it was not po&s;|&s;ible for him to keep pace with them. The poor Tartar boy, attached to him with more &s;incerity than his other &s;ervants, had followed him on foot; and when he fainted, he took him up behind him; but before they had rode &s;ix miles, the hor&s;e's hind quarters gave way, and they were both ob|liged to di&s;mount.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, without guide, and un|der&s;tanding but little of the language, it was with great difficulty he explored his way to the coa&s;t once more. He now found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to put on the meane&s;t appearance po&s;&s;ible: His clothes were worn out and in tatters. They had &s;everal rivers to pa&s;s; but pleading poverty, they were carried over gratis. He had retained the greate&s;t part of the money he had concealed at A&s;trabad, but dared not to &s;hew it. At length the admi|ral's company halting, he got up with them
<PB N="48" REF="59">
again, and was joined by his clerk and &s;er|vant, who had fortunately procured hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The next day he &s;ent to the admiral for other cattle, who ordered them; but demand|ing more than five times their value, he pro|cured &s;ome of another per&s;on. The ad|miral now made a feint, as if he meant to &s;top the progre&s;s of the in&s;urgents, who were advancing in pur&s;uit of him, and or|dered all the avenues to be guarded. Mr. Hanway had then not eaten any thing for near forty hours, except at few parched pea&s;e, which he had by chance in his pocket; and was driven to beg of the pea|&s;ants, what he dared not buy.</P>
<P>In the night, although the admiral had pro|mi&s;ed not to march without him, he quitted the place with all his baggage, leaving Mr. Hanway and his &s;ervants behind, without the lea&s;t provi&s;ion, and unprotected. Tru&s;t|ing to Providence, he again determined to follow the admiral, whom fortunately he
<PB N="49" REF="60">
overtook. In a dark and tempe&s;tuous night, in which, however, he had, with great difficulty, been able to keep pace with the baggage hor&s;es, until he was quite &s;pent; urged by de&s;pair, he &s;eized the bridle of the hor&s;e on which the admiral him&s;elf was mounted, and pronounced the word <HI>Shah</HI> with the utmo&s;t empha&s;is. The determined &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s with which he uttered this word brought the Per&s;ian to that &s;en&s;e of duty, which his promi&s;e, or the dictates of huma|nity, had not effected: He halted, and or|dered his Vi&s;ier to take him up behind him, till he afterwards procured a hor&s;e for him|&s;elf; and one of the carriers had compa&s;&s;ion on the faithful Tartar boy, and took him Up. The clerk and &s;ervant had yet &s;trength to walk; but the former, after a few miles, not able to proceed, begged Mr. Hanway to re|lieve him with the u&s;e of his hor&s;e, to which he con&s;ented, till his own fatigue obliged him to di&s;mount his fellow traveller; and from
<PB N="50" REF="61">
that time he &s;aw no more of his clerk till &s;ome days after his arrival in Ghilan.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ions of the admiral, who knew the cruel di&s;po&s;ition of the Turku|man Tartars, hurried him on from &s;even in the evening till the &s;ame hour next morning; and, after a &s;hort refre&s;hment, till four in the afternoon, amid&s;t a continued rain and tempe&s;t. Mr. Hanway was more than once overcome with &s;leep and fatigue; but &s;till it was his good fortune to get up with his company again.</P>
<P>On the morning of the fourth of Febru|ary, intelligence was received that a body of Tartars had been at the hou&s;e the admiral had &s;lept at; and in their rout between the confines of a wood and the &s;ea &s;hore, the advanced guard gave the alarm, as if a body of Tartars had been po&s;ted in the wood; the courageous admiral immediately changed his clothes for mean ones; and preparing for battle, gave orders to fire in upon them:
<PB N="51" REF="62">
When Mr. Hanway came up, he found five mi&s;erable Afghan recruits, who had been travelling towards the Shah's camp, weltering in their blood, and expiring of the wounds they had received. The next day and night they travelled twenty hours. The inroads of the Ca&s;pian, and the torrents from the mountains, had formed many chan|nels, &s;ome of which were hardly fordable; and the &s;urge on the &s;ea &s;hore, near which they were &s;ometimes obliged to pa&s;s, threw down &s;everal of the hor&s;es, and their riders were in danger of being drowned. On the &s;eventh the admiral thought him&s;elf out of danger, and relaxed a little in his pace.</P>
<P>It is not the cu&s;tom in ea&s;tern coun|tries for any man to come near the women, except their lord; but circum|&s;tances had happened in this expedition which prevented a &s;trict regard to di&s;tinc|tions; and Mr. Hanway had more than
<PB N="52" REF="63">
once the office (not a very dignified one in Per&s;ia) of guarding the admiral's women.</P>
<P>He had now pa&s;&s;ed through the whole province of Me&s;anderan; but &s;uch had been his di&s;tre&s;s, and the inclemency of the weather, that in twenty-three days he had not enjoyed an hour of &s;ecurity or unbroken &s;leep. He was drawing near to Lan|garood, which he had left &s;even weeks be|fore; and Captain Elton hearing that he was on the road, &s;ent a &s;ervant with hor&s;es to meet him, and received him with open arms, congratulated him on his having e&s;caped with his life and liberty, and confi|dently a&s;&s;ured him that the Shah would cau&s;e ju&s;tice to be done him.</P>
<P>After a few days his clerk and &s;ervant, who had been left behind, were brought in by Captain Elton's &s;ervants: The clerk ap|peared as a man expiring in a lingering con|&s;umption; he had been two days and three nights expo&s;ed to the weather without &s;hel|ter
<PB N="53" REF="64">
or food, and five times robbed, till he was left nearly naked. The interpreter arrived about three weeks after: He had obtained a pa&s;&s;port from Sadoc Aga, under his &s;eal, the &s;tyle of which, con&s;idering all circum|&s;tances, conveys a curious idea of Per&s;ian folly. It was in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMIES BE IT KNOWN, THAT MATTEUSE, THE AR|MENIAN, IS HERE: LET HIM NOT BE MOLESTED, BUT LIVE UNDER OUR &endq;SHADOW."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway arrived at Langarood, his feet and legs were much &s;welled; his clothes had not been put off for a long time, and having no opportunity of attending to the natural delicacy of his con&s;titution, he found his health much impaired. After &s;tay|ing &s;ome days with Captain Elton, to refre&s;h his wearied &s;pirits, he took his leave and &s;et out for Re&s;hd, where he arrived on the nine|teenth, and with difficulty procured an inter|view
<PB N="54" REF="65">
view with the governor of the province, who informed him the Shah was expected to be in Turkey, or near the borders of Syria, in a &s;hort time; on which he determin|ed to continue his journey in &s;earch of him: and having provided fre&s;h clothes, hor&s;es, and tents, and firelocks and &s;abres for his five attendants, he &s;at out from Re&s;hd, and on the &s;econd of March arrived, very near blind with the reflection of the &s;now which lay on the ground, at Ca&s;bin, where was a new palace built by Nadir Shah.</P>
<P>This city is famous for having been the re|&s;idence of many of the ancient kings of Per&s;ia: It was one of the chief cities of Parthia, and the burial place of Hephe&s;tion, the favourite of Alexander the Great; but it was now almo&s;t ruined, and the inhabitants were re|duced to di&s;tre&s;s by the cruel oppre&s;&s;ion of Nadir.</P>
<P>March the eleventh, the weather having become mild, and the &s;now being in a great mea&s;ure di&s;&s;olved, Mr. Hanway joined a
<PB N="55" REF="66">
company going to the camp of the Shah, who was reported to be marching towards Hamadan. On the road they pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;keletons of &s;everal camels, who&s;e fle&s;h had been devoured by wolves, and &s;aw all the way the mi&s;erable effects of Nadir's tyran|ny, in the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of the inhabi|tants. The whole appeared a &s;cene of de&s;olation; and the people taking them for robbers, or &s;oldiers, which were as bad, fled to the mountains, and left them to provide for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway now di&s;covered that all his Per&s;ian fellow travellers were in the cu&s;tody of a me&s;&s;enger, who was conducting them to the camp; and &s;uch was this terror which Nadir's cruelty had excited, that this &s;ingle per&s;on kept eight or ten officers of di&s;tinc|tion, with all their &s;ervants, pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>On the twentieth they arrived at the Shah's camp, and Mr. Hanway pitched his tent near the royal &s;tandard, which was
<PB N="56" REF="67">
no &s;ooner done, than an accident happened that was very near preventing him from ever telling his adventures. He had ordered the fire arms to be placed round the in&s;ide of the tent; and while he was &s;tanding up, one of the firelocks, which in Per&s;ia have no guard to the trigger, went off, and car|ried two &s;lugs through the top of the tent, ju&s;t over his head. The tent being of cot|ton was &s;et on fire, but no notice was taken of the accident.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. Hanway, immediately on his arrival in the camp, had delivered his petition, pray|ing to be reimbur&s;ed the value of his cara|van, into the chancery; and in a little time obtained a decree of the Shah, &startq;that the particulars of his lo&s;s &s;hould be delivered &endq;to Behbud Khan, the Shah's general," now arrived at A&s;trabad, &startq;who was to return &s;uch parts of the goods as could be reco|vered, and make up the deficiency out of &endq;the &s;eque&s;tered e&s;tates of the rebels."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="68">This decree, although a &s;ignal mark of the ju&s;tice of Nadir, was yet ungrateful to our traveller, becau&s;e it made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to return again to A&s;trabad, the &s;cene of his former troubles; but his zeal for the cau&s;e in which he had embarked overcame every ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Mr. Hanway waited to receive an an&s;wer to his petition, he had lei&s;ure to make ob&s;ervations on the objects before him. He vi&s;ited every part of the Shah's camp, informed him&s;elf of the manner of conduct|ing his wars, tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tate, of his force, amu&s;ements, and character.</P>
<P>Such was the di&s;gu&s;t which the tyranny of Nadir had excited in the brea&s;ts of the Per&s;ians, and &s;o many rebellions again&s;t his government were on foot, that the utmo&s;t exertion was nece&s;&s;ary on his part to coun|teract them. He was in his tent of audi|ence from &s;even in the morning till ten at
<PB N="58" REF="69">
night, except retiring for very &s;hort inter|vals.</P>
<P>In placing the camp, the tents of the mini&s;ters and principal officers were in the front, or to the right and left of the Shah's quarters, that &s;ome of them might be always near him. The circuit of the Shah's own tents was very large; the entrance con&s;i&s;ted on one &s;ide of a line of uniform tents, &s;erv|ing for guard-rooms, and on the other of the teats in which the affairs of the chancery, and the like public concerns, were tran&s;acted. About two hundred yards beyond this ave|nue was the pavilion in which the Shah u&s;ually &s;at to give audience, and tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s; the front was always open, even in the wor&s;t weather; but when it was ex|tremely cold, &s;everal pots of charcoal were &s;et in the middle. Behind the pavilion were placed the Shah's private tents, to which were admitted only his &s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries, when they had any remarkable intelligence
<PB N="59" REF="70">
to communicate. Near the&s;e were the tents of the Shah's ladies; and the whole was &s;urrounded by a fence, round which the night guard patrolled, and &s;everely puni&s;hed any who were found near the quarter of the women. None but the officers in immediate waiting were admitted into the royal pa|vilion: The officers of &s;tate and people of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tood in the open air in all wea|thers, forming a &s;emicircle in front of the tent.</P>
<P>The market, which was well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, apparel, hor&s;e furniture, and other nece&s;&s;aries, was about half a mile long, con&s;i&s;ting of tents on each &s;ide like a &s;treet. The &s;hopkeepers of con&s;equence were ge|nerally under the protection of &s;ome of the principal courtiers, who took care to be in|tere&s;ted in the profits, particularly of flour and rice, of which there was always a great con&s;umption. The Shah often inquired into the prices of provi&s;ions, and reduced
<PB N="60" REF="71">
them as he thought proper, fining the market people upon every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The two imperial &s;tandards, although it required twelve men to move them, were lengthened in the &s;taffs by Nadir, and made &s;till heavier, to prevent their being carried off by the enemy, except in an entire de|feat. The Shah had about &s;ixty women, and nearly the &s;ame number of eunuchs, who, in a journey, generally rode near his per&s;on; before him were his running footmen and body guards, &s;preading a mile or two: The&s;e gave notice of his approach, and cleared the way. When he travelled with his women, the army was kept at almo&s;t a mile di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nadir's &s;tanding forces were computed at 200,000 men; to &s;upport which, Per&s;ia had been ruined, and India &s;poiled of one hun|dred and twenty millions &s;terling, and near twice as many thou&s;and &s;ouls. He thought a &s;oldier always fought better when he had
<PB N="61" REF="72">
&s;omething to lo&s;e, therefore encouraged the wearing of co&s;tly furniture, particularly for the hor&s;e. He him&s;elf had four complete &s;ets, one mounted with pearls, another with rubies, a third with emeralds, and the la&s;t with diamonds, mo&s;t of which were of a prodigious &s;ize; but &s;et in a barbarous ta&s;te, &s;everal being bored through.</P>
<P>Co&s;min Khan, the chancellor, was em|ployed, whil&s;t Mr. Hanway was in Per&s;ia, in writing the hi&s;tory of Nadir's wars; but no account of the completion of the work has appeared: which is not, perhaps, much to be regretted, as Nadir had a &s;ight of it from time to time in its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h language is the mo&s;t com|mon in Per&s;ia. In matters of learning they u&s;e the Arabian, in which is pre&s;erved the greate&s;t part of that knowledge, for which the Per&s;ians were once di&s;tingui&s;hed. As time &s;eems to have made little change in the cu&s;toms of A&s;ia, the &s;ame manners remain
<PB N="62" REF="73">
as are read of two thou&s;and years ago; and the language retains the &s;ame idiom and &s;ublimity of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians write like the Hebrews, from the right to the left, and often range their lines in an arbitrary manner, &s;o that on one leaf the writing &s;hall have ten different directions, all in exact proportion, as to di&s;tance, and the number of words and lines in each.</P>
<P>While Mr. Hanway remained in the camp, he was witne&s;s to &s;everal acts of cruelty, committed by Nadir. He had ap|pointed a certain general, governor of a pro|vince, on which an exorbitant tax had been impo&s;ed, to be levied in &s;ix months: At the expiration of the term, the governor was &s;ent for to the camp, and required to pro|duce his account: He did &s;o; but it amount|ed to only half the &s;um demanded. The Shah told him he had embezzled the other half of the money, and ordered the execu|tioners
<PB N="63" REF="74">
to ba&s;tinado him to death. His e&s;tate, when confi&s;cated, fell very &s;hort of the de|mand, and his &s;ervants were ordered to come into the Shah's pre&s;ence. He inquired of them if there was any thing left, belong|ing to their late ma&s;ter: They an&s;wered, "only a dog;" which being brought before Nadir, be ob&s;erved that the animal appeared to be much hone&s;ter than his ma&s;ter, and directed that he &s;hould be led through the camp, from tent to tent, and beaten with &s;ticks; and wherever he expired, the ma&s;|ter of the tent &s;hould pay the money de|ficient. The dog was accordingly carried to the tents of the mini&s;ters &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, who immediately gave &s;ums of money, ac|cording to their re&s;pective abilities, to pro|cure his removal; and the whole &s;um de|manded was rai&s;ed in a few hours.</P>
<P>Soon after a man was executed with cir|cum&s;tances, which gave Mr. Hanway a yet &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion of the Shah's cruel
<PB N="64" REF="75">
di&s;po&s;ition. The man was accu&s;ed of hav|ing made greater exactions in his employ|ment of a tax-gatherer, than he had ac|counted for to the Shah. Being condemned to death, Nadir &s;aid to him, <Q>&startq;I under&s;tand you can dance well; dance and I will &s;ave &endq;your life."</Q> <Q>The man began immediately to dance, in tran&s;ports of joy; but the Shah ordered the executioner to &s;trike him on the legs, which preventing his performance, the tyrant cried, &startq;the ra&s;cal dances ill; kill &endq;him."</Q></P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh of March Mr. Han|way &s;et off from the camp. The &s;pring being already advanced, the brightne&s;s of the &s;ky, the falls of water from the rocks, the &s;tupendous mountains, far higher than any he had &s;een in Europe, ri&s;ing gradu|ally one above another, &s;ome with their &s;ummits covered with &s;now, and others con|cealing their heads in the clouds, formed a delightful &s;cene. The vines were full of
<PB N="65" REF="76">
foliage; the orange groves perfumed the air with their fragrance, and the gardens were in full blo&s;&s;om. <Q>Where po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is in&s;e|cure, and the hu&s;bandman knows not that $e &s;hall be permitted to reap the fruit of what he &s;ows, the hand of indu&s;try is never very con&s;picuous; "but here," &s;ays Mr. Hanway, &startq;nature, with a little labour, &s;eemed &endq;to furni&s;h all that was needful or plea&s;ant."</Q> The return of &s;pring naturally delights the mind: but mu&s;t have been particularly delightful to one who&s;e winter had been at|tended with &s;uch circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>April the fifth he arrived at Langarood where he was again kindly received by Mr. Elton, and remained with him till the fir&s;t of May, when he left that place to travel by land through the province of Me&s;anderan to A&s;trabad. There were in all in his com|pany &s;ix per&s;ons well armed. The fir&s;t even|ing, they were benighted and lo&s;t their way in a wood; but at length, di&s;covering
<PB N="66" REF="77">
a light, they made towards the place and found the hou&s;e barricadoed with trees. They u&s;ed every entreaty to per&s;uade the ma&s;ter of it to conduct them on their journey; but their rhetoric not having the de&s;ired effect&punc; they proceeded, like true Per&s;ians, to break into his hou&s;e, and tying a rope to one of his arms, compelled him to conduct them; but this outrage being the effect of mere nece&s;|&s;ity, Mr. Hanway took care to reward him well for his trouble, and &s;ent him home again when they had regained their path.</P>
<P>They had not proceeded far before two of the men hired to conduct the baggage, through feat or &s;ome wor&s;e cau&s;e, left their loads and their company in a very abrupt manner. The next night, while the hor&s;es and mules were at pa&s;ture, a wolf of a very extraordinary &s;ize, of which there are many in the neighbouring mountains, made his appearance; but being driven off by the guard, he contented him&s;elf with killing a
<PB N="67" REF="78">
cow. In the morning they came up with a detachment of fifty &s;oldiers, the comman|der of which very courteou&s;ly offered them his &s;ervice as a convoy, which Mr. Hanway was very ready to accept, and pur&s;ued his journey in their company.</P>
<P>As they advanced further in the province, the pea&s;ants grew more in&s;olent. Mr. Han|way had &s;eparated from the officer, and had obtained of him ten of his company as a guard; and now the villagers, many of whom had been engaged in the late in&s;ur|rection, apprehen&s;ive that the &s;oldiers had orders to arre&s;t them, took to their arms, and refu&s;ed to &s;upply them with any provi&s;ions. He, however, procured &s;ome food, on con|dition that the &s;oldiers &s;hould remain all night under arms in the field, where he him|&s;elf pitched his tent; but the guards left their convoy in the night, contrary to their en|gagement, and proceeded to take care of them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="79">Early in the morning they &s;truck their tents, and, to avoid the exce&s;&s;ive heats, de|termined to travel only in the mornings and evenings. At <HI>Amul</HI>, a city &s;ituate at the foot of that part of mount Taurus, where Alexander is &s;aid to have encamped and re|fre&s;hed his army, they &s;aw the ruins of one of the cities of ancient Per&s;ia, and a palace of &s;tone, which Shah Abas the Great often made his re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Hanway met with a writer who had retreated with him before the Tur|kuman Tartars from A&s;trabad, from whom he learned that Sadoc Aga and his troops, when they came into this place, were not above one hundred and fifty in number; but as the admiral had but &s;ixty fighting men with him, they would certainly have attacked him if the town's people had not magnified his force: That Zadoc Aga, to give a formidable impre&s;&s;ion of the num|bers in his army, had demanded of the
<PB N="69" REF="80">
city fifty thou&s;and pairs of hor&s;e &s;hoes;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Shah had e&s;tabli&s;hed a manufactory at Amul for making hor&s;e-&s;hoes and other works in iron.</NOTE> and that the rebels were entirely defeated.</P>
<P>On the ninth, Mr. Hanway arrived at Balfru&s;h, where this news was confirmed, and he was further informed that the people of A&s;trabad had &s;ubmitted very quietly to Sadoc Aga, the rebel governor, while he was in &s;trength; but that he having left I&s;mael Beg, a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, as their gover|nor, upon the news of the rebels being de|feated, they had &s;eized their new governor, and cutting holes in his fle&s;h, they &s;et light|ed candles in them, and in that &s;tate led him naked about the market place, until he dropped down dead. Cruel treatment of a man, whom their own actions had te&s;tified, they thought was guilty of no crime!</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of May, leaving Bal|fru&s;h, Mr. Hanway proceeded on his jour|ney,
<PB N="70" REF="81">
and travelled &s;ome miles on the great Cau&s;eway, made by Shah Abas the Great, which runs near three hundred Engli&s;h miles. They pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal temples of the ancient Gebres, or wor&s;hippers of fire (where at one time po&s;&s;ibly was the &s;ame phoenome|non as at Baku) and al&s;o the ruins of a pa|lace built by Shah Abas, far exceeding in grandeur any other on the coa&s;t of the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea. On the &s;ixteenth they reached A&s;trabad. As they approached, they met &s;everal hor&s;emen carrying home the captured pea&s;ants, who&s;e eyes had been cut out; the blood yet running down their faces. Near the entrance into the city were two pyra|mids of &s;tone, each of forty feet high, built by Nadir, in which were niches, the greater number having human heads placed in them, being the heads of people who had offended the Shah, and had been exe|cuted by him or his generals.</P>
<P>On his arrival this &s;econd time at A&s;tra|bad,
<PB N="71" REF="82">
Mr. Hanway waited on Behbud Khan, the general, to whom he pre&s;ented the de|cree he had obtained of the Shah, who promi&s;ed him that he would cau&s;e it to be executed with the utmo&s;t effect. He was &s;eated in his aivan or tent, with a &s;emicircle of &s;oldiers drawn up below him, judging and executing, in a very &s;ummary way, the rebels who were brought before him, one or two at a time. After a &s;hort repa&s;t, a pri&s;oner was brought who had two large logs of wood rivetted to the &s;mall of his legs, and a heavy triangular collar of wood about his neck; one of the angles being longer than the others, &s;erved as a handcuff to his left wri&s;t, &s;o that if he attempted to re&s;t his arm, it mu&s;t pre&s;s on his neck. After being que&s;tioned for &s;ome time about the caravan of European cloths, of which it appeared he knew very little; the general ordered him to be beaten with &s;ticks, which was immediately performed by the execu|tioners
<PB N="72" REF="83">
with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, as if it was intended to kill him, and the &s;cene was clo&s;ed with an order to cut out his eyes. Sadoc Aga was then produced. In the hour of his &s;hort-lived pro&s;perity, while he was a general of the rebel troops, he had treated Mr. Hanway with an unbecoming in&s;olence; but how changed was his appearance! When Mr. Hanway &s;aw him la&s;t, he was a youth of uncommon vivacity, richly dre&s;&s;ed, and full of mirth; but now his garb was mean, his voice &s;unk, and his eyes cut out of their &s;ockets. <Q>He expre&s;&s;ed his inability to make any re&s;titution of the property; &startq;for he &endq;had been deprived of every thing."</Q> This an&s;wer the general returned, by an order to &s;trike him on the mouth, which was done with &s;uch violence that the blood gu&s;hed out.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway might have now retorted on &s;ome of the&s;e wretched men, the taunts they had be&s;towed on him, while he was in
<PB N="73" REF="84">
their power; but re&s;entment was not a pre|vailing pa&s;&s;ion in his compo&s;ition: His hu|manity led him to con&s;ider that there is never a proper time to in&s;ult the wretched; and he took his leave in &s;ilence, having his heart too full to enjoy this kind of enter|tainment, although he could perceive the general imagined the &s;cene would have af|forded plea&s;ure to him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was waiting to receive the remains of the cloths as they were found, he was witne&s;s to &s;everal executions of the unfortunate rebels, which were conducted with very little ceremony: They were led to a field near the re&s;idence of the military judge, and being made to kneel blind-folded, and pronounce the creed, <Q>&startq;There is but one God; Mahomet is &endq;his prophet, and Ali his friend," the head was taken off with the motion of a &s;abre in a thru&s;ting cut, which in drawing back completed the operation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="85">The payment for the re&s;t of the value of the goods, over and above what had been recovered, being made very &s;lowly, Mr. Hanway repre&s;ented to the general the in|conveniency he &s;uffered by the delay. He acknowledged that a part of the money had been appropriated to the Shah's u&s;e; but proffered him &s;ome of the women pri&s;oners, who might be &s;old as &s;laves, in part of pay|ment; and upon his refu&s;al to accept this kind of compen&s;ation, the general endea|voured to procure of him a receipt for the amount, and to take his bill payable in fif|teen days; but Mr. Hanway had experienced too much of Per&s;ian infidelity, to &s;ign an in&s;trument which might be produced again&s;t him as evidence of his having received complete &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth of June, having obtained in goods and money eighty-five per centum of the original value of his cara|van; and Captain Woodrooffe having in|formed
<PB N="75" REF="86">
him he was arrived in the bay with the &s;hip, he left A&s;trabad, and embarked on his return.</P>
<P>In their voyage along the &s;outhern coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian, they were attacked by &s;even of the Ogurtjoy pirate boats. His com|mi&s;&s;ion from his Ru&s;&s;ian partners prohibited him from interfering in any thing military; but &s;ome &s;hot being fired gave the pirates &s;uch an idea of their great guns, that they de&s;i&s;ted and fled.</P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway arrived at Langarood on the twenty-third of July, he found Cap|tain Elton in a very bad &s;tate of health. He &s;taid with him a week, and then &s;et off for Re&s;hd; but the &s;ea&s;on being very un|healthy, he was &s;eized him&s;elf with a dan|gerous and uncommon &s;ickne&s;s, which de|tained him till the thirteenth of September, when he left Re&s;hd, and embarked at Pere|bezar. He had inve&s;ted the whole &s;um re|covered by virtue of the Shah's decree, in
<PB N="76" REF="87">
raw &s;ilk, which he had now the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee &s;afe on board in the Ca&s;pian; and after a pa&s;&s;age of thirteen days he arrived at Yerkie. Here he was vi&s;ited by the com|mander of the guard&s;hip, who informed him that if he had any other goods on board, but &s;uch as were the produce of Ghilan, and did not declare it, the law made it death to the offender. The governor of A&s;trachan had been informed that there was a plague at Ca&s;han, from whence manufac|tured Per&s;ian goods were wont to be brought into Ru&s;&s;ia; and to prevent infection, the commander required the &s;hip's crew to come on &s;hore on a &s;mall uninhabited i&s;land on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Volga, and a fire being made, the &s;urgeon and his attendants took the windward &s;ide of them, and demanded to &s;ee their brea&s;ts: When he was &s;atisfied they had no infection, their letters were de|livered to him, being fir&s;t dipped in vinegar, and dried in the &s;moke; but after waiting
<PB N="77" REF="88">
till the eleventh of October, in very cold and dangerous weather, they had the mortifica|tion to learn that they were ordered to per|form a quarantine of &s;ix weeks on the i&s;land Caraza, &s;ituate a little way up a branch of the Volga, towards the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The quarantine being expired, they were required to &s;trip them&s;elves entirely naked in the open air, and go through the unplea&s;ant ceremony of having each a large pail of warm water thrown over them, before they were permitted to depart; but what gave Mr. Hanway the mo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s was, to hear that the di&s;patches, which he had &s;ent forward in one of the Empre&s;s's boats, had been taken by the Khalmuck pirates, and twelve &s;oldiers, who were the guard, put to death.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;econd of November, he de|parted from A&s;trachan for St. Peter&s;burgh. The Volga was covered with ice, &s;o that the pa&s;&s;age to Zaritzen by water was now ob&s;tructed. He determined, therefore, to
<PB N="78" REF="89">
travel by land on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the river, and reaching Zaritzen on the eleventh day after, arrived at Mo&s;cow the twen|ty-&s;econd of November. Here he received letters, acquainting him of the death of a relation, by which he reaped certain pecu|niary advantages, much exceeding any he could expect from his engagement in the Ca&s;pian affairs: <Q>&startq;Providence was thus in|dulgent &endq;to me," &s;ays he, &startq;as if it meant to reward me for the &s;incerity of my &endq;en|deavours."</Q> The di&s;tance between Mo&s;|cow and St. Peter&s;burgh, as already men|tioned, is four hundred and eighty &s;even Engli&s;h miles; yet he arrived there in three days, drawn in a &s;ledge over the frozen &s;now. The road is marked by rows of trees, planted about twenty yards a&s;un|der, and the conveyance is &s;o ea&s;y to the traveller, that he &s;lept whil&s;t they travelled hear &s;eventy miles. On the fir&s;t of January, 1745, he arrived at St. Peter&s;|burgh, after an ab&s;ence of a year and &s;ix|teen
<PB N="79" REF="90">
weeks, in which time he had travelled about five thou&s;and four hundred Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>At this place he had &s;ome differences with the per&s;ons who had been intere&s;ted in the Ca&s;pian trade; but they were &s;uch as a failure of &s;ucce&s;s was likely to produce, and being re|ferred to arbitration were amicably adju&s;ted, and he re&s;ided at St. Peter&s;burgh five years.</P>
<P>During this period, the Ru&s;&s;ian factors u&s;ed all their endeavours to induce Captain Elton to leave the &s;ervice of the Shah, and return to his original alliance; but in vain, he continued inflexible. It appeared, in|deed, that at one time, when an honourable appointment in England was offered to him, that he had reque&s;ted the Shah to permit him to &s;ail to A&s;trachan in one of his own &s;hips; but his reque&s;t was refu&s;ed by the Shah; a tran&s;lation of who&s;e decree was tran&s;mitted to London, by Elton, and is as follows:</P>
<P>"BY merits of the Almighty God, our
<PB N="80" REF="91">
commands are obeyed. The propere&s;t of the Chri&s;tians, GEMEL BEG,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name given by the Shah to Elton, &s;ignifying <HI>The Lord of Beauty</HI>.</NOTE> commi&s;&s;ioner of our royal navy on the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, is by our imperial and mo&s;t gracious favour exalt|ed, and given to know that his petition, with regard to his fini&s;hing one large &s;hip, and de&s;iring leave to go with &s;uch &s;hip to A&s;tra|chan; and concerning &s;everal other points; is come to our mo&s;t &s;acred pre&s;ence, and the meaning thereof under&s;tood. But as our imperial de&s;ign is to call the propere&s;t of the Chri&s;tians, at new year, to our victorious &s;tirrup, and to &s;ettle our naval affairs on a right foundation: Therefore, the propere&s;t of the Chri&s;tians mu&s;t defer going to A&s;tra|chan him&s;elf, but &s;end &s;uch &s;ailors as he has with him, who under&s;tand navigation, to take care of the &s;hip to that port; and the propere&s;t of Chri&s;tians mu&s;t remain where he is, and fini&s;h the other &s;hips ordered,

<P>After Mr. Hanway left Per&s;ia, Nadir Shah, who&s;e cruelty had continued to en|crea&s;e with his years, was be&s;et with rebel|lions in every quarter of his dominions; his own relations, to whom he entru&s;ted his armies, de&s;erted his cau&s;e, and his &s;itua|tion became truly dangerous. At this cri&s;is he called before him &s;ome of the Ou&s;beg and Turkuman Tartars, who compo&s;ed part of his army, and having &s;worn them to &s;ecrecy and obedience, he di&s;clo&s;ed his de|&s;ign of putting to the &s;word all the Per&s;ians in his camp the following night.</P>
<P>A Georgian &s;lave, in Nadir's tent, over|heard &s;ome part of the conference, and
<PB N="82" REF="93">
di&s;covered it to &s;ome of the principal Per&s;ian officers. In &s;uch an extremity, the only re|&s;olution to be taken was, that Nadir &s;hould die: Salib Beg, an officer of great intrepi|dity, commander of the body guard of Af&s;hars, offered his &s;ervice, and demanded only for cho&s;en men to a&s;&s;i&s;t. A few hours before the &s;ignal was to be given for the in|tended ma&s;&s;acre, Salib Beg and his followers, under pretence of urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed the guard, and ru&s;hed into Nadir's tent. When they approached, he drew his &s;abre, and demanded what bu&s;ine&s;s they had. Salib Beg made no an&s;wer, but &s;truck him with his &s;abre: The blow was aimed at his head, but fell on the &s;houlder. Nadir killed two of the &s;oldiers, and was retiring out of the tent when he fell over the cords. The tyrant cried, <Q>&startq;Have mercy, and I will for|give &endq;you all;" to which the officer replied, &startq;You have &s;hewn no mercy to others, there|fore &endq;merit none your&s;elf;" and gave him a mortal wound.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="94">The Tartars, to whom Nadir had always been partial, no &s;ooner heard of his death, than they made a general attack on the Per|&s;ians: before day-light five thou&s;and men were de&s;troyed; and the army &s;eparated, after a continued campaign of eighteen years.</P>
<P>It is a curio&s;ity natural to the mind to in|quire the fate of Elton, who preceded Mr. Hanway in the voyage to Per&s;ia, and, by his abilities, obtained the confidence and &s;upport of the Shah.</P>
<P>Nadir's death did not quite qua&s;h the hopes of Captain Elton. The pea&s;ants of Ghilan attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, and a ball, fired from a &s;ecret hand, pa&s;&s;ed through his coat; but he e&s;caped, and &s;urvived, un|der the protection which his abilities procured him from <HI>Ali Kouli</HI>, Nadir's nephew and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. After his death, the Per&s;ians having no king whom they thought proper to obey, the elders of Ghilan took the people under their care, in form of an ari&s;tocracy. Captain
<PB N="84" REF="95">
Elton, who knew the&s;e men meant no good to him, refu&s;ed to obey them, and &s;hutting him&s;elf up in his hou&s;e, determined to op|po&s;e them; but not having &s;ufficient &s;trength, he capitulated with <HI>Hahdgee Gemal</HI>, their chief, for the &s;afety of his per&s;on and ef|fects; but the faithle&s;s Hahdgee, like a ge|nuine Per&s;ian, regardle&s;s of his word, &s;eized his effects, and condemned him to be hanged. He was leading to execution, when news arrived that one of the chief captains in the elders' army, was gone over to Ma|hommed Ha&s;&s;an their enemy. This threw every thing into confu&s;ion; the elders were obliged to fly, and they carried Elton along with them. It was hoped this change in their affairs would have awakened &s;ome pity in the brea&s;ts of the elders, and that Captain Elton would have e&s;caped; but they were incapable of commi&s;eration, and he was &s;hot by their orders in April, 1751.</P>
<P>Thus fell this enterprising Engli&s;hman,
<PB N="85" REF="96">
who&s;e whole life was a &s;cene of &s;trange adven|tures, and who&s;e exten&s;ive mind had formed a plan, and even proceeded to execute it, for introducing the manufactures of England into the furthe&s;t parts of Per&s;ia; a country &s;o re|mote, &s;o difficult of acce&s;s, and at that time &s;o &s;hook and di&s;turbed by inte&s;tine war and commotion.</P>
<P>It comes not within the limits of this de|&s;ign, intended to convey to po&s;terity &s;ome idea of the intrepidity, per&s;everance, and ad|dre&s;s of Mr. Hanway, to de&s;cribe more mi|nutely the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the empire of Per&s;ia, and the manners of the inhabitants. If what is here mentioned &s;hall awake the curio&s;ity of the reader, he may find it agreeably &s;atisfied by recurring to the Travels them&s;elves; and the learned &s;tudent will accompany him with peculiar plea&s;ure in his journey over this truly cla&s;&s;ic ground, the &s;eat of arts, of arms, and the theatre of noble events, from the earlie&s;t traces of time. However,
<PB N="86" REF="97">
as <HI>Nadir Shah</HI> makes a principal figure in this relation, I have here added &s;ome of the leading features of his character, in Mr. Hanway's own words; which may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of his &s;tyle in this difficult &s;pecies of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;<HI>Nadir</HI> was an Af&s;har, his face was rounder, and his no&s;e le&s;s inclined to the Roman, than the Per&s;ians generally are. His hair was black; his eyes large and expre&s;&s;ive; his forehead high; and his complexion &s;warthy. His body was ro|bu&s;t; and his &s;tature about &s;ix feet; his &s;houlders were round. His whole coun|tenance and per&s;on were awful, particu|larly &endq;when he &s;poke.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;His voice was &s;o &s;trong and &s;onorous, as to be audible to an incredible di&s;tance; and the effect it had upon his own &s;oldiers, as well as an enemy, when he gave his commands in the field of battle, proved one
<PB N="87" REF="98">
great &s;tep to his advancement to the regal &endq;power.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;His corporal &s;trength was not le&s;s in|&s;trumental to his fortune. The extreme indulgence which had been &s;hewn him by nature, in the vigour of his con&s;titu|tion, received an accumulated force by &endq;the habit of his life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The battle-ax is one of the mo&s;t ancient weapons among the Orientals; but it had been for &s;ome years much neglected in Per&s;ia; Nadir re&s;tored the u&s;e of it, in a more particular manner; it was his fa|vourite weapon, in&s;omuch, that before he a&s;&s;umed the diadem, he was generally &s;tyled the Ax-Khan. Afterwards he was often &s;een with a battle-ax in his hand, playing with it in his tent of audience. His blows with this weapon carried with them inevitable death, of which he gave many proofs, His memory was as re|markable, as his perfect knowledge of the
<PB N="88" REF="99">
genius and temper of the Per&s;ians. As he had no turn to contemplation, his &s;pirits were free and untired by any reflections but what immediately aro&s;e from his employments in the field. He was far advanced in life before he had learnt to read; nor did any part of his knowledge depend the lea&s;t on books. His pre&s;ence of mind was very remarkable; and his re|&s;olutions were almo&s;t as quick as his thoughts; hence he did many things ex|&endq;travagant and ab&s;urd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;At one part of his life he drank freely of wine and brandy; but afterwards ab|&s;tained from the latter intirely, and u&s;ed the former, in &s;uch a proportion only, as gave the greater energy to his thoughts, and &s;upported the activity and &s;trength of his body. He u&s;ed to feed liberally upon a &s;imple diet; yet he would march a whole day upon the &s;trength of a few
<PB N="89" REF="100">
parched peas, which it is common for the &endq;Per&s;ians to carry in their pockets.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;His dre&s;s was not remarkable; his mind &s;eemed to be &s;uperior to external pomp or luxurious &s;oftne&s;s. His pride was in precious &s;tones, with which his diadem was adorned, and he wore &s;everal in his turbant al&s;o. He was often &s;een with a large &s;apphire in his hand, with which &endq;he u&s;ed to amu&s;e him&s;elf in his tent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Some in&s;tances of Nadir's cruelty were the effects of policy. Upon occa&s;ion of his memorable exploit of driving the Af|ghans out of Per&s;ia, when he entered Isfa|han in triumph, one of his &s;oldiers vio|lated the wife of a Per&s;ian of di&s;tinction. The man complained to Nadir, that he &endq;could not live after &s;o great an indignity:</Q> 'No,' &s;ays Nadir, 'I think you cannot;'  <Q>&startq;and immediately ordered him to be &s;trangled. He then explained to his of|ficers the rea&s;on of his conduct, in the&s;e
<PB N="90" REF="101">
&endq;terms:</Q> <Q>&startq;A victorious army cannot al|ways be re&s;trained. Had I redre&s;&s;ed this man's wrongs, I &s;hould have a hundred &s;uch complaints made to me, and my time would have been taken up in cha&s;tizing my &s;oldiers, in&s;tead of employing them &endq;to conquer the enemies of our country.'</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;He &s;uffered &s;everal to pa&s;s with impu|nity, though he knew they gave him no le&s;s har&s;h an appellation than villain; but towards tho&s;e who exerci&s;ed their wit in keen &s;atire, he was inexorable. It is a compliment among&s;t the Per&s;ians, to &s;ay, &endq;upon the entrance of a gue&s;t, &startq;Your place &endq;was very void.</Q> In the mau&s;oleum which <Q>&startq;Nadir cau&s;ed to be built at Me&s;ched, for his reception after death, &s;ome body wrote &endq;on the walls, in very pathetic terms; &startq;O Nadir! how full of thy renown is every corner of the earth: Thy name indeed is very great; but thy place here is very &endq;void.</Q> <Q>Severe inqui&s;ition was made for

<P><Q>&startq;The avarice of this tyrant was no le&s;s remarkable than his cruelty. It was his cu&s;tom, according to the practice of for|mer kings, to &s;end for the governors of the provinces, however remote from his camp, to appear before him every new-year's day. His intention in this very frequently was to mulct them, or put them to death. His ordinary method was to interrogate them concerning the &s;tate and condition of the province, and of their own behaviour in particular. From thence he proceeded to trifling and &s;uperfluous que&s;tions, concluding that he &s;uppo&s;ed &endq;they had defrauded him of large &s;ums.</Q> <Q>The&s;e que&s;tions were ordinarily followed
<PB N="93" REF="104">
&startq;by the ba&s;tinado, to induce them to condemn them&s;elves, or to accu&s;e other people of being depo&s;itaries of con|&s;iderable &s;ums. It frequently happened that the&s;e per&s;ons, either to avoid the pain of corporal puni&s;hments, or with the hopes of being re&s;tored to their govern|ments, have given in a fictitious li&s;t of per&s;ons as their debtors, with the &s;ums due from each, and al&s;o of effects depo&s;ited in their hands. They even took this oc|ca&s;ion to gratify their private re&s;entments, by mentioning tho&s;e as their debtors, who had given them any offence. The con&s;e|quence of the&s;e declarations was the i&s;&s;u|ing a decree, ordering the collection of &s;uch &s;ums and effects, by the &s;evere&s;t ex|ecutions of military law, without any liberty of appeal previous to the payment. If the&s;e pretended debtors, after a &s;evere beating, were found incapable of pay|ment,
<PB N="94" REF="105">
orders were often given to collect &endq;&s;uch &s;ums from the province.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It does not appear, from any circum|&s;tance of the fir&s;t &s;tage of this man's life, that his temper was avaricious. It is na|tural to believe, that he thought nothing could &s;ecure his u&s;urpation better than the poverty of the people, as the mo&s;t effec|tual means of preventing their rebellions, or of rendering them abortive. This is the be&s;t argument that can be brought in extenuation of that crime, which at length became the great moving principle to drown Per&s;ia in blood. Poverty, without doubt, was a great di&s;couragement, and often proved a bar to the &s;ucce&s;s of their attempts again&s;t him. But what can we &s;ay of his unju&s;t and cruel treatment of private per&s;ons, merely for the &s;ake of what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; where there was not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their &endq;loy|alty?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106"><Q>&startq;In 1740, &s;everal di&s;tricts in Ghilan were ordered to equip &s;oldiers for the &s;ervice of the crown, and to be an&s;werable in the penalty of one thou&s;and crowns for each de&s;erter. This proved a &s;ource of oppre&s;|&s;ion; for the&s;e recruits were generally ill paid, and ill treated in the army, that they might be tempted to de&s;ert; and the pay|ment of the penalty was always rigorou&s;ly &endq;exacted of the &s;ecurities.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;When he found him&s;elf bound in honour to di&s;approve of the behaviour of his governors, of who&s;e unju&s;t conduct all po&s;&s;ible evidence had been given, his decrees for re&s;titution to the complainants were generally expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch ambigu|ous terms, as rendered the applications for ju&s;tice vexatious, and the i&s;&s;ue of them oftentimes un&s;ucce&s;sful. Sen&s;ible of his predominant vice, his greate&s;t officers greedily ama&s;&s;ed riches, as the &s;ure&s;t means of their pre&s;ervation; though it

frequently happened, tho&s;e very riches were the cau&s;e of their de&s;truction. Hav|ing been often challenged to an&s;wer for their corruption, &s;everal of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable among&s;t them, at length re&s;olved to keep a regular account of all pre&s;ents they received, that in ca&s;e of need they might produce it; but &s;till it was a mi&s;|fortune to po&s;&s;e&s;s any money; for Nadir &s;eldom thought he had got their all. Shew and equipage is a favourite pa&s;&s;ion among the Per&s;ians, yet I ob&s;erved the governors who came to an&s;wer for their conduct, and other great officers, cho&s;e to walk on foot in the camp, rather than appear in any circum&s;tances of affluence. As to the officers of rank, they imagined their &s;e|curity &endq;con&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing pre&s;ents.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Avarice, the peculiar weakne&s;s of old age, increa&s;ed on Nadir with his years; yet his rapaciou&s;ne&s;s might not be entirely an effect of this pa&s;&s;ion. If we con&s;ider the
<PB N="97" REF="108">
va&s;t expence of his army; the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of rai&s;ing taxes upon his people, in the latter part of his reign; and that his &s;afety depended on the military power with which he was &s;urrounded; his In|dian trea&s;ure, though reputed very large, was not &s;ufficient to check his apprehen|&s;ions &endq;of want.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Much may be alledged for the &s;u&s;pi|cious turn which he took; for the Per|&s;ians are as gentle, &s;oft, and per&s;ua&s;ive in their manners, as they are full of cunning and deceit. They are polite, and affect conde&s;cen&s;ion to &s;trangers or gue&s;ts; but where they have any power or authority, their deportment is &s;elfi&s;h, haughty, and in&s;olent: To this we may add a &s;trong propen&s;ity to rebellion. From his earlie&s;t life Nadir had an experimental knowledge of them, in all their &s;everal ranks and conditions; and &s;eemed now to have adopted as an invariable maxim, that they
<PB N="98" REF="109">
could be ruled only with a rod of iron. Thus &s;everal cau&s;es concurred to cheri&s;h a cruel, jealous di&s;po&s;ition. As he mount|ed the throne by means of the corruption and immorality of the people, policy &s;till required him to &s;ow the &s;eeds of a jealous enmity among the principal per&s;ons under &endq;his command.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Whil&s;t Nadir's glory was ripening, it was his policy to make great profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ervices he &s;tood in need of; but afterwards he acted on the wretched maxim, that a king has no friend or relation: Gratitude, con&s;e|quently, could not appear as a princely virtue, nor have any &s;eat in his brea&s;t; on the contrary, he &s;eemed diffident, that tho&s;e who were capable of a zealous con|cern for his intere&s;t from a principle of affection, might, on the &s;ame principle, be partial to others al&s;o, if his conduct &endq;&s;hould render him ungrateful to them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="110"><Q>&startq;But the amiable qualities of the mind be|ing &s;o rare, they could be no great objects of his dread; the perfections mo&s;t level to his ob&s;ervation, and which &s;truck mo&s;t forcibly on his mind, were corporal &s;trength and valour. Though he often &s;tood in need of the&s;e, the per&s;on who acquired any di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation for them, be|came the object of his envy, if not of his fear.

<P><Q>&startq;A certain &s;oldier had often di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the field of battle: His &s;kill in the u&s;e of the &s;abre was not le&s;s extra|ordinary than his corporal &s;trength, and he was at length made a Khan. The Per|&s;ians, in their hyperbolical manner of &s;peaking, &s;ay, that this man could cut a mule, with a pack-&s;addle on her back, through at one &s;troke. It is hardly cre|dible how much the Per&s;ians e&s;teem bodily &s;trength, and military abilities: Nadir ca&s;t

a jealous eye on this per&s;on; as if he meant to try his virtue, he gave him the charge of a beautiful girl, to be carried to his brother Ibrahim Khan. On the way he debauched her; and Ibrahim di&s;co|vering the indignity, &s;ent her back to his brother. It is ea&s;y to imagine that Nadir would re&s;ent the affront al&s;o; in &s;hort, he vowed to &s;hed the blood of the of|fender. Riza Kouli Myrza, then in high favour with his father, had a very parti|cular regard for this officer; he attended the pri&s;oner before the Shah's pavilion, pleaded his cau&s;e and obtained his pardon. Nadir, for the &s;ake of his vow, ordered a bit of the offender's ear to be cut off. This, however, was but a temporary re|prieve: Soon after he was &s;ent to burn a Turki&s;h village; but before it was po&s;&s;ible for him to arrive there, he was recalled, and que&s;tioned why he had not performed his orders; and after &s;everal imperious
<PB N="101" REF="112">
in&s;ults, Nadir commanded that he &s;hould be &s;trangled. Before the bow-&s;tring was thrown about his neck, he made a &s;ign, as if he had &s;omething of importance to communicate; and, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion was permitted. The Khan availed him&s;elf of this interval, to plunge out of the hands of the execu|tioners; and, &s;eizing the &s;abre of one near him, ru&s;hed forward towards the Shah, who ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and retired before his enemy. The attendants near the royal pavilion interpo&s;ed, and killed the delinquent, but not before he had &s;lain &endq;three of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The natural pride of the human heart is flattered, when our &s;uperiors bring them&s;elves down to our level. The gene|ral who is not over tender of his per&s;on, becomes the minion of the common &s;ol|diers; but if to courage he adds liberality, he &s;ubdues their hearts. Nadir was a
<PB N="102" REF="113">
ma&s;ter of every art of this &s;ort, and in his fir&s;t appearances of life, gained the univer&s;al affection of the army. He was no &s;ooner ve&s;ted with a command, than he became a&s;&s;iduous to ingratiate him&s;elf with the &s;oldiers, not only by procuring them their pay in due time, but al&s;o good clothing at an ea&s;y price, with the addition of occa&s;ional gifts. He was not ignorant of the u&s;e of clemency, in circum&s;tances of great importance: A party of Ou&s;begs, who had done him &s;ignal &s;ervice in battle, afterwards de&s;erted from him; he &s;ent a body of troops, and brought them to his camp as pri&s;oners; they expected death; but he bid them continue to &s;erve him faith|fully, as they had already done, and made every private man a pre&s;ent of fifty crowns, and gave five hundred to each officer. Common prudence, indeed, obliged him to be watchful of the oeconomy of his
<PB N="103" REF="114">
army: yet the meanne&s;s of his educa|tion could not be corrected by his ad|vancement to the diadem; and whil&s;t jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t became his con|&s;tant companions, cruelty and avarice gained the a&s;cendant over him, in every action of the latter part of his life; this appeared in many circum&s;tances, not only towards his army, but to the people in &endq;general.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;No part of Nadir's character was more di&s;tingui&s;hed, than that of a general; he lived in the field in the &s;everal characters of a pea&s;ant, a captive, a &s;ervant, a rob|ber, a &s;oldier, a general, and a king. Bred up in all the arts and &s;ubtleties of the Tar|tars, he acquired a great proficiency in the practical knowledge of robbery. Hence it is ea&s;y to imagine, that a per&s;on of his extraordinary natural talents and per&s;onal &s;trength, &s;hould become forward, bold, and enterprizing. Enured to a military life,
<PB N="104" REF="115">
he acquired a &s;trong inclination for that variety which a continued change of place is apt to create. The intrepidity which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;o eminent a degree, is a dazzling quality among men profe&s;&s;ing arms; but &s;ucce&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed his character &endq;as an able and fortunate general.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;His quickne&s;s of ob&s;ervation where his forces were weake&s;t, and his pre&s;ence of mind in &s;uccouring them, ever gave him a wonderful &s;uperiority over his enemies. His re&s;olution &s;eemed to in&s;pire his people with a determined purpo&s;e to conquer or die; nor did his officers ever behave ill with impunity. In action, he generally tired many hor&s;es, being never long mi&s;|&s;ing where his pre&s;ence was needful. Up|on the&s;e occa&s;ions he was wont to addre&s;s his men in &s;uch familiar terms, as &s;eemed to demon&s;trate an opinion that a &s;oldier will not perform his duty well, when he has no regard for his general. He found it
<PB N="105" REF="116">
indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to keep his army in motion, to prevent tho&s;e con&s;piracies, for which a great part of his &s;oldiers were always ripe; by this means al&s;o, the people in the remote parts of the empire were kept in awe, and he was ready to op|po&s;e the inva&s;ion of his neighbours, or to &endq;make conque&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As he enjoyed great health, and was enured to exerci&s;e, his activity was hardly to be exceeded. His mind was &s;trongly tinctured with the notion of prede&s;tina|tion, and he became &s;o much the more dauntle&s;s by it; yet we do not find that he fell into the ab&s;urd practice of deviat|ing from the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, with which this erroneous principle &s;ome|times affects its votaries. He &s;eldom placed a confidence that was unnece&s;&s;ary, or expo&s;ed him&s;elf to a danger that was avoidable. In the conduct of his wars, he ever preferred &s;tratagems to force.
<PB N="106" REF="117">
His marches were always amazingly rapid, and his progre&s;s &s;o irregular, and contrary to the ordinary rules of war, that he con|founded his enemies. In the height of his grandeur he would, upon any emergency, out march his baggage, and &s;uffer any hard|&s;hip incident to a common &s;oldier. Thus he often defeated the be&s;t laid &s;chemes of his enemies, and attacked them where they were lea&s;t able to defend them&s;elves. Yet in matters of the greate&s;t moment, his re&s;olutions were generally &s;o quick, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ing ordinary apprehen&s;ions, that it &s;eemed doubtful whether they were the effects of a &s;olid judgment, or a blind temerity. Under the difficulties in which he was often involved, irre&s;olution &s;eemed to be what he dreaded mo&s;t; nor did he dare to a&s;k advice, le&s;t he &s;hould weaken &endq;the &s;uperiority by which he governed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Many circum&s;tances of the politics of this extraordinary man were unfathomable,
<PB N="107" REF="118">
particularly in his puni&s;hing offenders; petty crimes he often cha&s;tized with heavy puni&s;hments, whil&s;t offences of the blacke&s;t dye &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed with impunity, or a &s;light re&s;entment. Even tho&s;e who had been in open rebellion again&s;t him, he has more than once rein&s;tated in their office, or pre|ferred them to greater dignities. Thus he &s;eemed inclined to tru&s;t tho&s;e who had been his avowed enemies, rather than &s;uch &endq;as he had not yet proved."</Q></P>
<P>IT was Mr. Hanway's wi&s;h to quit St. Peter&s;burgh, and come to England much &s;ooner than he did; and the frequent di&s;ap|pointments that happened to prevent his returning to his native country increa&s;ed his de&s;ire of &s;eeing it.</P>
<P>The ninth of July, 1750, he left St. Pe|ter&s;burgh, and pa&s;&s;ed by Peterhoff, a palace built by Peter the Great, on an eminence on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Gulph of Finand,
<PB N="108" REF="119">
thirty-five wer&s;ts from St. Peter&s;burgh. <Q>It was then not uncommon for the Ru&s;&s;ians to compare the water-works of this place with tho&s;e of Ver&s;ailles, with this di&s;tinction in their favour, &startq;that the waters of Peterhoff &endq;are &s;weet."</Q></P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the gulph he had an opportunity of viewing the dry-dock, contrived by Peter, at Cron&s;tadt, &s;o large as to receive fourteen &s;hips of the line, to build or re|pair in the dry, and afterwards to float them by letting in the water.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth he embarked in a yacht belonging to Dantzig, and in three days ar|rived at Revel, the capital of E&s;tonia. When this place &s;urrendered to Peter in 1710, the plague had raged with &s;uch fury, that, of fifty thou&s;and inhabitants, not four thou|&s;and remained alive to receive their con|querors.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth he arrived at Dant|zig, where he was very politely received by
<PB N="109" REF="120">
Mr. Gib&s;on, who was then re&s;ident from the king of Great Britain, and procured a copy of the celebrated painting of Van Eyck, repre&s;enting the ble&s;&s;ings of the virtuous, and the torments of the wicked, which he brought with him to England.</P>
<P>He &s;taid a week at Dantzig, and, having bought a chariot, pa&s;&s;ed through Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, taking in his way Stolpe, Neu|gerten, Koening&s;burg, Bernau, and came to Berlin. Here were &s;everal per&s;ons of learning and abilities, particularly Voltaire; Baron Polnitz, author of the Memoirs known by his name; Pillotier, author of the Hi&s;tory of the Celts; and Lieberkyn, phy&s;ician to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Lieberkyn was a man after Mr. Han|way's own heart: His great abilities and di&s;intere&s;ted practice, his humanity to his patients, and his great charity to the poor, had made him univer&s;ally re&s;pected. The&s;e good qualities naturally led Mr. Hanway to
<PB N="110" REF="121">
&s;eek the Doctor's friend&s;hip, which he at|tained. Here was al&s;o Mr. Schmidt, the en|graver, a &s;ubject of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, whom he brought with him to Berlin from Paris, and who in his art had hardly a &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway was at Berlin at the time of the Carou&s;al, a &s;ea&s;on devoted to plea&s;ure, and di&s;&s;ipation of thought. One part of the entertainment was a proce&s;&s;ion of four parties or companies, in the proper habili|ments of Romans, Carthagenians, Grecians, and Per&s;ians, all mounted on hor&s;es richly capari&s;oned in like manner. A mock battle was afterwards fought, which was a much more &s;plendid entertainment. <Q>&startq;Four thou&s;and men having marched out in the morning early, about a German mile from the city, were followed by ano|ther detachment of the &s;ame number. Both armies plied their artillery warmly. A rivulet was pa&s;&s;ed, a wood was attacked, and the enemy driven from it to a village,
<PB N="111" REF="122">
which was carried &s;word in hand. After this they went through all the evolutions, and exerci&s;es, of both cavalry and in|fantry. At this &s;how almo&s;t the whole &endq;city of Berlin was pre&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t Mr. Hanway remained here, Lord Malton, afterwards Marquis of Rockingham, arrived, to whom Mr. Hanway paid his re|&s;pects; and when he had viewed the curio&s;ities of Berlin, went to Charlottenberg, and Pot&s;|dam, and &s;aw the gardens and apartments of Sans Souci, a &s;mall palace, then the fa|vourite retreat of the king.</P>
<P>The twenty-third of Augu&s;t he left Pot&s;|dam, and came to Wittenburg, in the Electorate of Saxony, famous for its manu|factory of coar&s;e cloths; and pa&s;&s;ing through Annaburg, and Gro&s;shagn, came to Dre&s;|den, the metropolis of the Electorate, where he was introduced to &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction, particularly the young Count Buenau, and M. de Veith, ma&s;ter of the ceremonies
<PB N="112" REF="123">
to the king of Poland, by the latter of whom he was attended to the Grune Ge|wolbe, a part of the palace which is a repo|&s;itory of great riches, as well as curio&s;ities. Among the curio&s;ities &s;hewn him here, was a &s;et of bells made of Dre&s;den porcelaine.</P>
<P>From Dre&s;den he came to the ca&s;tle of Mei&s;&s;en, in which is the porcelaine manu|factory. The workmen, who are about &s;even thou&s;and, are all confined as pri&s;oners. The ca&s;tle is impenetrable to any but the per&s;ons immediately employed, and the &s;e|cret of mixing and preparing the ingredients is known to but very few even of the&s;e. This article was importable, only under an oath of its being for private u&s;e, and not for &s;ale, although the &s;hops of London were in general &s;upplied with it.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through Leip&s;ig, he came to Magde|burg; he was yet in the dominions of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The po&s;ts are under the direction of the government, and one-third part of
<PB N="113" REF="124">
the hire goes to the crown: Near Helm&s;tet the po&s;tillion attempted to pa&s;s through a bye-way to avoid payment of a &s;mall duty; an officer who was po&s;ted at an avenue to prevent this practice, rode up, &s;topped the chariot, and &s;eized one of the hor&s;es as forfeited; and would not de&s;i&s;t till Mr. Hanway alighted, with a pi&s;tol in his hand, and acquainted him that whatever fault the po&s;tillion had committed, he him&s;elf had paid for the hor&s;es according to the laws, therefore if he pre&s;umed to detain him, he would re&s;i&s;t him as a robber; upon which the officer thought proper to let him pa&s;s.</P>
<P>From Helm&s;tet he came to Wolfenbuttle, the next day to Brun&s;wick, and from thence to Hanover, where he was vi&s;ited by Count William Bentinck, who happened to be in the &s;ame inn. The palace of Herenhau&s;en, which is commonly recommended to the at|tention of travellers, he found very &s;hort of his expectation. The building is by no means
<PB N="114" REF="125">
grand; but the garden may be admired. In it is a jet d'eau, erected by an Engli&s;hman, which throws the water &s;eventy feet high.</P>
<P>September the thirteenth, he left Han|over, and pa&s;&s;ing through Zell, Wei&s;&s;en|dorff, and Zoehrendorff, came to Hamburg, where he met with many factors with whom he had been connected in a mercantile line, particularly Mr. Bo&s;anquet, Mr. Hanbury, and Mr. Thornton, deputy governor of the Briti&s;h company.</P>
<P>After &s;taying at Hamburgh about three weeks, he went to Bremen, intending to go on to Embden; but the weather being unfavourable for travelling, he determined to make the be&s;t of his way to Am&s;terdam, where his corre&s;pondency as a merchant procured him acquaintances; of the want of which, foreigners not intere&s;ted in com|merce generally complain when they come to this place.</P>
<P>October the &s;ixteenth he left Am&s;terdam,
<PB N="115" REF="126">
and went by water from Haerlem to Ley|den, and from Leyden to the Hague; pa&s;|&s;ing through Rotterdam, he went in a yacht to Helvoet, and after a pa&s;&s;age of twenty-two hours from Helvoet&s;luys, land|ed at Harwich the twenty-eighth of Octo|ber, 1750, after an ab&s;ence from his native country of near eight years.</P>
<P>It was Mr. Hanway's con&s;tant practice, from his early youth, to commit to writing not only every occurrence of moment, but his thoughts on it at the time: In the rough journal of his travels there is a &s;hort reflection on the plea&s;ure he felt in being once more &s;afe landed on his native land; and in a fair tran&s;cript of the journal, &s;eem|ingly made with intention to be printed, this reflection is much amplified, and con|cluded with &s;ome &s;tanzas of the Ode writ|ten by Mr. Addi&s;on, on his return from his travels, which I cannot forbear adding here, although &s;o well known.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART II.</HI> REMARKABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE LIFE OF JONAS HANWAY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>THERE never was a truer patriot than Mr. Hanway: The love of his native country he carried with him wherever he went; and he omitted no opportunity of informing him&s;elf of the events which
<PB N="118" REF="129">
pa&s;&s;ed in it. <Q>Nothing that happened among his friends was indifferent to him; and he at la&s;t relinqui&s;hed a lucrative line of trade, to return to England, that he might &startq;<HI>con&s;ult his own health, and do as much good to him|&s;elf &endq;and others as he was able."</HI></Q> <Q>"You know, my dear, &mdash;" &s;ays he, in a letter written from Peter&s;burgh to a mo&s;t intimate friend in London, &startq;that it is only the de&s;ire of gain|ing &s;omewhat, to make the evening of my life comfortable, in my native land, which keeps me here. I have lo&s;t one partner (he was old and his death to be expected), and I mu&s;t &s;tay &s;ome time longer to in|form my new one, who is young, and has all the &s;anguine expectations of a young man; but I covet no more than I can enjoy: What &s;hould detain me an eager votary of fortune, who am drooping under ill health, langui&s;hing for a life of rea&s;on, and wi&s;hing to lay down my head in peace whenever my hour &s;hall come?
<PB N="119" REF="130">
It is not to play at cards, to flatter, to dance, and to drink, that I de&s;ire to return to you, though I can bear all the&s;e, except drinking: <HI>your Radcliffe's library, and fireworks, and quiet evening a&s;&s;embly</HI>, I con&s;ider as Milton's de&s;cription of Hea|ven; and if I am not de&s;tined to die a martyr here to the Per&s;ian trade, I will &s;et off &s;oon for my dear country, and my &endq;much-loved friends."</Q></P>
<P>He had now attained his wi&s;h, and the reader mu&s;t take his leave of him as a tra|veller. The re&s;t of his life, with the ex|ception of two &s;hort intervals, was &s;pent in England, in a continued cour&s;e of good actions, pur&s;ued with &s;uch a&s;&s;iduity, that this latter part of it was hardly le&s;s active, though certainly le&s;s expo&s;ed to danger, than the former.</P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway arrived in London, he went to live at the hou&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, then Mrs. Town&s;end, in the Strand, where
<PB N="120" REF="131">
proper apartments had been prepared for him; and his mercantile affairs being finally clo&s;ed, except only &s;ome remittances which he received afterwards from his partner at St. Peter&s;burgh, he lived here as a private gentleman. His fortune was &s;mall; but it was &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy all his wants, and afford a portion to alleviate real di&s;tre&s;s, when it came to his notice. His carriage, which was of the kind called a <HI>Solo</HI>, from its holding but one per&s;on, was ornamented with his motto, <HI>"never de&s;pair,"</HI> and the de|vice of a man ju&s;t e&s;caped from a &s;torm at &s;ea, on a de&s;olate coa&s;t, as de&s;cribed in page 45. His time was pa&s;&s;ed in arrang|ing the materials for a publication of his Travels; in tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s of his brother Thomas (who was now Captain of the Wind&s;or, and had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;everal engagements), and in acts of kind|ne&s;s and beneficence &s;uited to his income.</P>
<P>He cho&s;e to print his Travels at his own
<PB N="121" REF="132">
expence, that he might not lead a book&s;eller into an engagement to his lo&s;s, and engaged &s;ome of the be&s;t arti&s;ts of the time to en|grave the charts and maps, which he had procured abroad, and to de&s;ign and engrave &s;ome of the principal events that happened to him in the cour&s;e of his travels. I think I have heard him &s;ay the printing and en|graving co&s;t him &s;even hundred pounds. The fir&s;t edition of twelve hundred copies, in four quarto volumes, was publi&s;hed in Ja|nuary, 1753, and received with univer&s;al approbation; and when the concurrent te&s;ti|mony of men of ta&s;te and learning had given the work the &s;tamp of merit, he clo&s;ed with an offer made him by Mr. A. Millar, the book&s;eller, for the &s;ale of the copy-right. Mr. Millar publi&s;hed a &s;econd edition in two large quarto volumes, and after that a third and fourth editions were printed and &s;old.</P>
<P>The clo&s;e application he had be&s;towed
<PB N="122" REF="133">
on this favourite object having con&s;ider|ably impaired his health, which at the be&s;t was but indifferent, and made &s;ome relaxation nece&s;&s;ary; as &s;oon as he had di&s;po&s;ed of his intere&s;t in his book, and &s;ent copies to &s;ome of his friends abroad, he went to pa&s;s a few weeks at Tunbridge Wells. The waters, and the amu&s;ements of the place, were of great &s;ervice to him; and his health being con&s;ider|ably recruited, in the beginning of Septem|ber he &s;at out on a journey to Paris. He &s;taid at Paris about a month, and having viewed the curio&s;ities of that city, and the neigh|bouring palaces, returned lei&s;urely to Lon|don, by way of Li&s;le, Bru&s;&s;els, Antwerp, and thence to Am&s;terdam.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>NATURALIZATION OF THE JEWS.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST he was on this tour of amu&s;e|ment and information, the great que&s;tion
<PB N="123" REF="134">
relative to the expediency of naturalizing the Jews came to be agitated, and hardly any par|liamentary bu&s;ine&s;s cau&s;ed a more violent altercation. It became the reigning &s;ub|ject of conver&s;ation in all parties; the public prints were full of arguments on one &s;ide or the other, and the clamour &s;pread it&s;elf abroad, wherever Jews were permitted to re&s;ide or to trade. Mr. Hanway thought it a duty to take a part in this popular que&s;tion; and having reduced his argu|ments again&s;t the propo&s;ed bill for natu|ralization into writing, he &s;ent the manu|&s;cript to London to be printed in the form of a pamphlet. The clamour continu|ing to increa&s;e, he &s;ent over a &s;econd edi|tion, with &s;ome &s;mall additions made to it at Am&s;terdam, which al&s;o was printed here.</P>
<P>In October he arrived in England, and went again to Tunbridge Wells, the
<PB N="124" REF="135">
waters of which had done him &s;uch &s;ervice. At this place he prepared for the pre&s;s his <Q>&startq;<HI>Review of the propo&s;ed Naturalization of the &endq;Jews,</HI> in which he endeavours to prove, from &s;cripture, from the antient and modern e&s;tabli&s;hment of that people, and the com|mercial &s;y&s;tem between this kingdom and foreign nations; that to give the Jews the right of natural born &s;ubjects, would be highly impolitic:</Q> And this afterwards prov|ed to be the opinion of the majority; for though the bill pa&s;&s;ed into an act, 26 Geo. ii cap. 26, it lived only a few months, be|ing repealed the very next &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Some facts &s;tated in Mr. Hanway's book On the &s;ubject, relative to the behaviour of foreign nations towards the Jews, had occa|&s;ioned an an&s;wer from an anonymous au|thor, who attacked the veracity of his repre&s;entation in rather an illiberal manner; and Mr. Hanway thought it nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="125" REF="136">
vindicate him&s;elf; which he did with &s;pirit and candour, in <HI>"Three Letters in Reply"</HI> to this writer, publi&s;hed in November, 1753.</P>
<P>The Stat. vii. Jac. 1. declares that the <HI>te&s;t</HI> of &s;ub&s;cribing the declaration again&s;t tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, and receiving the &s;acrament according to the rites of the church of England, as enacted by the 25th of Car. ii. &s;hall be required of all per&s;ons before they apply to be naturalized: The act for natu|ralizing the Jews was intended to repeal this clau&s;e, with re&s;pect to them; and a pam|phlet having been publi&s;hed, intitled, <HI>"Te&s;t and Conte&s;t,"</HI> Mr. Hanway wrote an an&s;wer to it, and took his leave of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is now almo&s;t forgotten; but it may be worthy the con&s;ideration of the &s;erious, and perhaps an argument in favour of the truth of our holy religion, that the Jews have never, in any part of the world where they have been di&s;per&s;ed, been
<PB N="126" REF="137">
incorporated with the natives; but remain to this day, however &s;eparated from their brethren, a di&s;tinct and peculiar people. <Q><HI>The &s;entence originally denounced again&s;t them, that they &s;hould</HI> &startq;be removed to all the king|doms of the earth, and become an a&s;toni&s;h|ment, a proverb, and a bye-word among&s;t all &endq;nations," <HI>&s;till remains in its fulle&s;t force</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>It was this &s;pirited oppo&s;ition to an impolitic law, which even the mo&s;t intelli|gent among the Jews thought inexpedient, that laid the foundation of Mr. Hanway's celebrity as a public &s;pirited man: His writings on the &s;ubject were eagerly read by per&s;ons of both parties, and he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the principal means of cau&s;ing the re|peal of the act.</P>

<PB N="127" REF="138">
<HEAD>PLAN FOR AN UNIFORM PAVEMENT OF THE STREETS.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time, 1754, Mr. John Spranger, a gentleman of Covent Garden, formed the outline of a plan for <HI>Paving the Streets of the City and Liberty of We&s;tmin|&s;ter</HI>, in an uniform manner, which he publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Some regulation of the pavements through|out the metropolis had long been thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; for the form, and level, and the quality of the materials within every pari&s;h or di&s;trict, were left to the di&s;cretion of a few inhabitants, who took the lead in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and in &s;ome places all form and regularity were lo&s;t, by neglect|ing to repair the defects as they were occa|&s;ioned,
<PB N="128" REF="139">
or by repairing them in an improper manner. The&s;e defects proceeded mo&s;t fre|quently from the bur&s;ting of the pipes laid for the conveyance of water to the hou&s;es: The water i&s;&s;uing from the bur&s;ted pipe, &s;pread under ground, and de&s;troyed the foundation of the pavement.</P>
<P><Q>Ever attentive to the public intere&s;t, in December, 1754, Mr. Hanway publi&s;hed his &startq;<HI>fir&s;t Letter to Mr. Spranger, on his ex|cellent Propo&s;als for Paving, Clean&s;ing, and Lighting the Streets of We&s;tmin&s;ter, &amp;c."</HI> in which, after making ob&s;ervations on the good effects likely to accrue from &s;uch a plan, drawn from experience in other countries; he proceeds to recommend the writing up the names of &s;treets,&mdash;the removal of bulks, and other ob&s;tructions,&mdash;fixing water trunks again&s;t the hou&s;es&mdash;and points out the manner of con&s;tructing kennels, the formation of footways,&mdash;regulation of &s;igns, &mdash;election of per&s;ons to &s;uperintend the
<PB N="129" REF="140">
pavements,&mdash;means of defraying the ex|pence, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>There were many propo&s;als made about this time for amending the &s;treets; and among the re&s;t, one of Lord Burlington was to pave the carriage-ways throughout, with the large&s;t &s;ize, un&s;quared &s;tones, &s;uch as are yet &s;een to form a few old cau&s;eways: The expence of paving the city of We&s;t|min&s;ter in this manner, was e&s;timated at two millions &s;terling.</P>
<P>It is not very ea&s;y to convey to a per&s;on who has not &s;een the &s;treets of this metro|polis before they were uniformly paved, a tolerable idea of their inconvenience and un|&s;eemline&s;s: The carriage ways were full of cavities, which harboured water and filth The &s;igns extending on both &s;ides the way into the &s;treets, at unequal di&s;tances from the hou&s;es, that they might not intercept each other, greatly ob&s;tructed the view, and, which is of much more con&s;equence
<PB N="130" REF="141">
in a crowded city, prevented the free circu|lation of the air. The foot-paths were uni|ver&s;ally incommoded, even where they were &s;o narrow as only to admit of one per&s;on pa&s;&s;ing at a time, by a row of po&s;ts, &s;et on the edge next the carriage way. He who&s;e urgent bu&s;ine&s;s would not admit of his keep|ing pace with the gentleman of lei&s;ure be|fore him, turned out between the two po&s;ts before the door of &s;ome large hou&s;e into the carriage-way: When he perceived dan|ger moving towards him, he wi&s;hed to re|turn within the protection of the row of po&s;ts; but there was commonly a rail con|tinued from the top of one po&s;t to that of another, &s;ometimes for &s;everal hou&s;es to|gether; in which ca&s;e he was obliged to run back to the fir&s;t inlet, or climb over, or creep under the railing, in attempting which he might think him&s;elf fortunate if he e&s;caped with no other injury than what proceeded from dirt: If, intimidated by the
<PB N="131" REF="142">
danger he e&s;caped, he afterwards kept within the boundary of the po&s;ts and railing, he was obliged to put a&s;ide the travellers before him, who&s;e ha&s;te was le&s;s urgent than his; and the&s;e re&s;i&s;ting, made his journey truly a <HI>warfare</HI>.</P>
<P>The French are reproached, even to a proverb, for their neglect of the conveni|ency of foot-pa&s;&s;engers in their metropolis, by not providing a &s;eparate path for them; but great as is the expo&s;ure to dirt in Paris, for want of a foot-way (which their many <HI>portes-cochers</HI> &s;eem likely for ever to prevent) in the more important article of danger, the city of London was, at this period, at lea&s;t on a par. How comfortle&s;s mu&s;t be the &s;en&s;ations of an unfortunate female, &s;topped in the &s;treet on a windy day, under a large old &s;ign, loaded with lead and iron, in full &s;wing over her head, and per|haps a torrent of dirty water falling near her, from a projecting &s;pout ornamented
<PB N="132" REF="143">
with the mouth and teeth of a dragon! The&s;e dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es are now at an end, and we may think of them as the &s;ailor does of the &s;torm which has &s;ub&s;ided; but the advantages derived from the pre&s;ent uniformity and cleanline&s;s of our &s;treets, can be known in their full extent, only by com|paring them with the former inconveni|encies.</P>
<P>But however nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome alteration was thought, no effectual &s;teps were taken at this time; and perhaps the bu&s;ine&s;s was at la&s;t ha&s;tened by an accident which happened, &s;ix years after, to the Speaker's carriage, in pa&s;&s;ing through the narrow en|trance near Craig's Court.</P>
<P><Q>In 1762, an act pa&s;&s;ed, appointing Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, each of whom &s;hould be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a net income of 300l. per annum, or an e&s;tate of 10,000l. value, and ve&s;t|ing authority in them to &startq;order any of the public &s;quares, &s;treets, and lanes, within
<PB N="133" REF="144">
the city and liberty of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and certain parts adjacent, to be paved, rai&s;ed, altered, clean&s;ed, and lighted, when, and &endq;in &s;uch manner as they &s;hould think fit;" and to enter into contracts for paving all or any of &s;uch &s;quares, &s;treets, and lanes.</Q> By this act 5,000l. was directed to be i&s;&s;ued to the commi&s;&s;ioners, out of the &s;upplies granted for the &s;ervice of the year, towards enabling them to carry the purpo&s;es of their commi&s;&s;ion into execution; and they were further authorized to make a rate, not ex|ceeding eighteen pence in the pound, of the yearly value of the hou&s;es before which their paving &s;hould extend. <Q>Their powers being found incomplete, the next year this act was &startq;explained, amended, and ren|dered &endq;more effectual" by another; and both the&s;e acts "explained and amended" by a third, pa&s;&s;ed the year after.</Q></P>
<P>Hitherto the commi&s;&s;ioners had pur&s;ued their plan without much ob&s;truction. The
<PB N="134" REF="145">
benefits of the new paving were &s;et in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous point of view, by compa|ri&s;on with the inconveniencies of the places not paved; and &s;uch confidence had the in|habitants of &s;everal large and opulent &s;treets, in the conduct of the commi&s;&s;ioners, that they petitioned them to new pave their &s;treets, and proferred to advance or rai&s;e money on the credit of the rates to be made on them&s;elves, to defray the expence, and pay the &s;ame to the commi&s;&s;ioners; who were to i&s;&s;ue the &s;ame as the work advanced, and lay <HI>&s;uch further rate on the inhabitants, as might be nece&s;&s;ary</HI>. To this the commi&s;&s;ioners acceded, and in 1765, an act pa&s;&s;ed to e&s;|tabli&s;h and complete the agreement. <Q>But whatever might be the advantages, the inha|bitants of the&s;e &s;treets, now called &startq;<HI>optional &endq;&s;treets,"</HI> expected to derive from &s;uch a humiliating treaty with the commi&s;&s;ioners, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have no great rea&s;on to vene|rate their wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight:</Q> They
<PB N="135" REF="146">
find them&s;elves burthened with a debt im|men&s;ely large, and rates proportionably high; and have the mortification to &s;ee, that if they had waited &s;ome months longer, and pur&s;ued the plan of the pari&s;hes, they would have obtained the &s;ub&s;tantial advan|tages of tran&s;acting their own bu&s;ine&s;s, and had the di&s;po&s;al of that money which now they have only the credit of having rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The year after, an act pa&s;&s;ed to put under the direction of the commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;uch parts of the road leading from the we&s;t end of the town as the new paving was propo&s;ed to extend to, and granting them one thou|&s;and pounds per annum, to be paid by the tru&s;tees of the Ken&s;ington road, with au|thority to rai&s;e money on the grant.</P>
<P>But the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, which is become, by the debt, an object of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equence to the inhabitants, will be be&s;t &s;een in the ab&s;tract:

<P>But the knowledge of the commi&s;&s;ioners in the bu&s;ine&s;s of paving began now to be thought not &s;o complete as was at fir&s;t ima|gined; and it was &s;u&s;pected that advantages had been taken of them by &s;ome of their
<PB N="138" REF="149">
contractors. The pari&s;h of Marybone would not enli&s;t under their banner; but applied to parliament, and obtained a local act, by which they were paved under commi&s;&s;ioners of their own nominating, and re&s;iding within their own di&s;trict; and in 1771 the &s;everal pari&s;hes within the city and liberty of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and parts adjacent, ob|tained an act, under which they have com|pleted what the commi&s;&s;ioners had begun, and have in no in&s;tance exceeded the rate of eighteen pence in the pound, on the rent of the inhabitants, to an&s;wer the joint pur|po&s;es of paving and repairing; and in the be&s;t regulated pari&s;hes, a con&s;iderable part of the money borrowed has been paid off by a &s;urplus of the rates.</P>
<P>This well-planned act, which is in reality an alteration of a bill pre&s;ented to parliament by the commi&s;&s;ioners, and which le&s;&s;ens, without annihilating, their authority in the parochial pavements, authorizes each pari&s;h
<PB N="139" REF="150">
to elect three commi&s;&s;ioners to repre&s;ent it in the general commi&s;&s;ion,&mdash;to appoint a committee to &s;uperintend its own bu&s;ine&s;s, &mdash;to borrow money for them&s;elves at as low a rate of intere&s;t as they can,&mdash;and to make a rate, five-&s;ixth parts whereof to be ap|propriated to pay the intere&s;t of the money borrowed, and the remaining &s;ixth part to lie by, and accumulate towards paying off the principal; which, in the be&s;t managed pari&s;hes, they will be able completely to do in a very few years.</P>
<P>This is the &s;hort hi&s;tory of an undertak|ing, which has introduced a degree of ele|gance and &s;ymmetry into the &s;treets of the metropolis, that is the admiration of all Europe, and far exceeds any thing of the kind in the modern world. Mr. Hanway, who&s;e hints and ob&s;ervations on the original plan were almo&s;t all adopted, attended clo&s;ely to the bu&s;ine&s;s until the plan was formed, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure carried into execution;
<PB N="140" REF="151">
but when he &s;aw that the great objects of health, cleanline&s;s, and &s;afety, were provided for, and that the citizens of London had come to a re&s;olution to adopt the new mode of paving; he directed his humane attention where he thought it would be of more gene|ral &s;ervice.</P>
<P>EARLY in the &s;pring of this year, 1755, intelligence was received that the French, with whom the war was now grown &s;erious, were fitting out a formidable &s;quadron of &s;hips at Bre&s;t, and had actually begun to a&s;&s;emble a body of forces, with intention to make a de&s;cent on this kingdom. This fil|led people's minds with con&s;ternation.

<P>THE next object of general benevolence, which engaged his attention, was the en|couragement of the breed of &s;eamen. The act of the &s;econd of Queen Anne, which directs every ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el of thirty tons burthen and upwards, to take one or more apprentice or apprentices from the pari&s;h, was &s;o much neglected as to be of little u&s;e, and the war, which had now commenced, made it apparent that &s;ome effectual regula|tion was nece&s;&s;ary. He at fir&s;t endeavoured, by &s;undry printed letters, addre&s;&s;ed to the ma&s;ters in the merchants &s;ervice, to per&s;uade
<PB N="142" REF="153">
them to comply with the directions of the act; but the &s;ingle voice of an individual was too feeble to be heard where intere&s;t was concerned. When once, however, he had engaged in any thing he thought right, he never remitted in his exertions till he had carried his point: Oppo&s;ition &s;erved but to increa&s;e his indu&s;try; and his zealous ap|plication to remedy this neglect of a wi&s;e and con&s;iderate act of parliament, produced in the end the MARINE SOCIETY, an in&s;ti|tution not to be equalled for &s;ub&s;tantial uti|lity, and real national advantage, by any undertaking in any age or country.</P>
<P>In March 1756, Fowler Walker, E&s;q. a barri&s;ter at law, fir&s;t propo&s;ed to the late Sir John Fielding, then John Fielding, E&s;q. to collect &s;uch vagabond boys as either were brought before him in his capacity of a ma|gi&s;trate, charged with petty offences, or were found wandering and begging in the &s;treets, and &s;olicit a &s;ub&s;cription for fitting them
<PB N="143" REF="154">
out to &s;erve at &s;ea; and Mr. Fielding, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Walker, &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to obtain &s;ufficient to clothe and fit out about four hundred poor boys.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway con&s;idering that the war would call for a greater number of &s;eamen than at that time exi&s;ted, and that &s;omething was nece&s;&s;ary to be done, before the boys could attain to the age and &s;trength of man|hood, &s;ummoned a meeting of merchants, and owners of &s;hips, to be held at a coffee-hou&s;e near the Royal Exchange, and there propo&s;ed to them to form them&s;elves into a &s;ociety for fitting out landmen-volunteers and boys, to &s;erve on board the king's &s;hips. The propo&s;al was eagerly embraced; a re|gular &s;ociety was formed, and a committee and proper officers appointed. July the 15th following, the fir&s;t ten landmen were delivered properly clothed on board a king's &s;hip, and the &s;ociety, under the direction
<PB N="144" REF="155">
of Mr. Hanway, proceeded in their enter|prize with great vigour and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>At this time Admiral Bo&s;cawen wrote a letter to Mr. Hanway, of which the fol|lowing is an extract. <Q>&startq;It is with great plea&s;ure that I &s;ee your labours for the good of the public brought to maturity; for I will venture to &s;ay, no <HI>&s;cheme</HI> for manning the navy, within my knowledge, has ever had the &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Marine Society</HI>: I have &s;een many of the men and boys you have &s;ent, who I am &s;ure will be|come u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, who would &endq;otherwi&s;e have been lo&s;t to the nation."</Q></P>
<P>"We found, &s;ays Mr. Hanway, in his addre&s;s to the public in favour of the de&s;ign, a great number of young fellows, in danger of becoming a prey to vice through idlene&s;s, who, as &s;oon as the garb of &s;eamen was pre|&s;ented to them gratis, gladly entered into the &s;ervice; and a number of boys loitering in filth and rags, and as the forlorn hope of human
<PB N="145" REF="156">
nature, ready for any enterprize; and we con|&s;idered that the pre&s;erving &s;uch per&s;ons, and rendering them u&s;eful, promoted the great end of government and true policy, in a double view."</P>
<P>In December 1757, a &s;ilver anchor was voted to Mr. Walker, and another to Mr. Hanway, by the &s;ociety; the latter in&s;cribed, <Q>&startq;As a token of the high &s;en&s;e we entertain of his public &s;pirit, in propo&s;ing, and his un|wearied a&s;&s;iduity in methodi&s;ing and carrying &endq;our de&s;ign into execution;" <HI>and the plan was found &s;o beneficial, that it met with general encouragement</HI>.</Q></P>

<P>The navy regulations require, that for every hundred men employed in actual &s;er|vice, four boys &s;hould be entered, and very near all this proportion of boys were clothed and &s;ent by the Marine Society.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the war, the &s;ociety, fearing that many of the boys fitted out by them, might be turned loo&s;e on the world again, and fall into mi&s;chief; applied to the Lords of the Admiralty, and obtained of them an
<PB N="148" REF="159">
order, that each boy di&s;charged &s;hould be victualled on board &s;hips in ordinary for a time not exceeding three months, and in his di&s;charge have a certificate from the com|mander under whom he &s;erved; but it ap|peared that &s;o many of them had become &s;eamen, and procured employment on board merchant &s;hips, or had obtained work on &s;hore, that when the &s;ociety offered relief to all who had been fitted out by them, and might be in want, only about four hundred applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In 1763, Mr. William Hicks, a mer|chant of Hamburgh, who had no near re|lation, and who had &s;hewn a friend|&s;hip for Mr. Hanway while he was at that place, left in his will the &s;um of twenty-two thou&s;and pounds to the &s;ociety; but directed that in times of peace half of the produce of his beque&s;t &s;hould be appropriated in placing out poor girls apprentice.</P>
<P><Q>By the words of Mr. Hicks's will, the
<PB N="149" REF="160">
money bequeathed was directed to be &startq;laid out in &s;ecure land, the produce to be ap|plied to the u&s;e of the Marine Society in &endq;London."</Q> This wording was &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome lawyers, to bring the beque&s;t with|in the &s;tatute of Mortmain, although the te&s;tator lived out of the juri&s;diction of the realms. The heir at law was a butcher's daughter in Hertford&s;hire, of very remote relation&s;hip; and although a deed of com|promi&s;e was offered by the &s;ociety to take eight-twentieths of the beque&s;t immediately, and three-twentieths more at the death of the heir at law, it was not till May, 1769, that the final divi&s;ion of the legacy was made.</P>
<P>In 1772, an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed to make the governors a body corporate, under the &s;tyle of the <HI>"Marine Society,"</HI> and ap|pointing Robert Lord Romney, Pre&s;ident; John Thornton, E&s;q. Trea&s;urer; and a cer|tain number of the governors, a committee
<PB N="150" REF="161">
for tran&s;acting the general bu&s;ine&s;s; a do|nation of twelve guineas to qualify the donor to be elected a governor for life, and a &s;ub&s;cription of two guineas for one year.</P>
<P>The office rented by the governors over part of the Royal Exchange being found in|convenient, in 1774 a &s;ub&s;cription was entered into for building a hou&s;e with apartments for their bu&s;ine&s;s; a piece of ground adjoining St. Ethelburga's church in Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, was taken on a build|ing lea&s;e of the committee for city lands, and a very ample and proper hou&s;e was erected, where the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ociety has ever &s;ince been carried on. This hou&s;e co&s;t near four thou&s;and pounds. The court room is &s;itted up, and decorated in a very elegant manner. Captain Thomas Hanway, having in his life time been one of the earlie&s;t &s;upporters, his brother gave a chamber mau&s;oleum erected to his memory to the
<PB N="151" REF="162">
&s;ociety, and it now forms a di&s;tingui&s;hed part of the ornaments of this court room.</P>
<P>At the top of the &s;tairs, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Royal Exchange (where the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ociety was at fir&s;t carried on), is erected a &s;mall &s;tatue, ca&s;t in metal, repre|&s;enting charity protecting a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed boy, with a &s;uitable in&s;cription on the pede&s;tal. This was the gift of Thomas Na&s;h, of Lon|don, grocer, one of the earlie&s;t patrons of the &s;ociety, who was afterwards Lord Mayor; and a copy of this group is placed at the front of the &s;ociety's pre&s;ent hou&s;e in Bi&s;hop&s;gate &s;treet.</P>
<P>I cannot take my leave of this excellent and truly patriotic in&s;titution, without ex|pre&s;&s;ing my approbation, however unim|portant, of the principle on which it is founded, and my &s;incere&s;t wi&s;h that it may &s;till increa&s;e in &s;plendour, and be as a foun|tain, from whence &s;hall &s;tow the ble&s;&s;ings of indu&s;try, emulation, and true Chri&s;tian

bravery to all parts of the Briti&s;h empire. Again&s;t every in&s;titution of a charitable na|ture, except this, at &s;ome time or other objections have been made; but the Ma|rine Society has the peculiar felicity to receive the concurrent applau&s;e of all man|kind. The invi&s;ible link with which, for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, Heaven attaches the parent to its own offspring, is here not weakened; the child is not &s;eparated from his natural parents till the time, when nature &s;eems to decree, that he &s;hould labour for his own &s;upport, and a&s;&s;ume a di&s;tinct character, dependant on his own exertions and recti|tude of conduct. What plan can be po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;ed more &s;ub&s;tantially beneficial than that which relieves di&s;tre&s;s, without encou|raging idlene&s;s; which checks the career of di&s;&s;ipation and vice, without &s;acrificing the agent, and transforms the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous part of the community into the mo&s;t u&s;eful and truly re&s;pectable?</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="164">Mr. Hanway had not only the merit of being the original propo&s;er of this de&s;ign; but by the mo&s;t judicious and uncea&s;ing at|tention to its intere&s;t, and the management of its finances, de&s;erved the title of its guardian al&s;o: He led it as it were by the hand, dur|ing its infant &s;tate; and protected and watched over it, with the care of a parent, till it arrived by degrees to the &s;trength and maturity it at pre&s;ent enjoys.</P>
<P>In 1757, Mr. Hanway publi&s;hed his "Journey from Port&s;mouth to King&s;ton," which running through two editions, in the la&s;t he animadverted on the pernicious cu&s;|tom of tea-drinking, and the expence it created to the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people.

The Doctor, in his warmth, perceived not that Mr. Hanway's remarks were not intended for people in his line of life, and by this e&s;&s;ay convinced their mutual friends, that he was not more &s;uperior to his adver&s;ary in learning, than inferior to him in affability and &s;ocial benevolence.</P>

<HEAD>FOUNDLING HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1758, Mr. Hanway paid fifty pounds to qualify him as a governor of the Found|ling Ho&s;pital for life, and with his u&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s &s;et him&s;elf to acquire a know|ledge of the &s;tate of the in&s;titution, and to con&s;ider how his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice might be be&s;t directed for its advancement. Of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this hou&s;e of refuge for de&s;erted children, the following is the be&s;t account I have been able to procure.</P>
<P><Q>In 1708, &s;ome merchants of London a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves together, and propo&s;ed to open a &s;ub&s;cription, and erect a hou&s;e for the reception of <HI>&s;uch infants as the mis|fortunes or inhumanity of their parents &s;hould leave de&s;titute of &s;upport</HI>; for it was found that, &startq;the officers, whom the laws had charged with the care of the poor, had
<PB N="156" REF="167">
been &s;o negligent, that &s;ome infants had been &s;uffered to peri&s;h with cold and hunger in the &s;treets, without any attempt &endq;for their relief."</Q></P>
<P><Q>This humane propo&s;al was not, however, carried into execution at this time; the rea|&s;on a&s;&s;igned, being the fear &startq;<HI>that it might &s;eem to encourage vice, by making too ea&s;y a pro|vi&s;ion &endq;for illegitimate children."</HI></Q> But though the merchants proceeded no further, yet their publications &s;eem to have evinced the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a Foundling Ho&s;pital; and the idea was &s;o warmly cheri&s;hed, that &s;everal per&s;ons left money by will to be ap|propriated to &s;uch an ho&s;pital when it &s;hould be erected.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t man who took up the bu&s;ine&s;s in a regular manner, was <HI>Mr. Thomas Co|ram</HI>, commander of a ve&s;&s;el in the merchants &s;ervice. <Q>In his introductory addre&s;s, he &s;aid, &startq;he had been a witne&s;s to the &s;hock|ing &s;pectacle of innocent children, who

<P>Names like the&s;e could not fail of &s;uc|ceeding. The addre&s;s was annexed to the petition to the king for a charter, which was immediately granted, and bears date the &s;eventeenth of October, 1739. The next year an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed to confirm and enlarge the powers granted by
<PB N="160" REF="171">
the charter, and the guardians purcha&s;ed land of the Earl of Sali&s;bury, in Lamb's Conduit fields, whereon to erect the pro|po&s;ed ho&s;pital. But willing to attempt &s;omething before the building could be com|pleted, they hired a hou&s;e in Hatton Gar|den, and in March, 1741, the fir&s;t thirty children were admitted. During that year one hundred and thirty-&s;ix were received under the care of the guardians, of whom &s;ixty-&s;ix died, which determined the go|vernors to &s;end their children to be nur&s;ed out of the impure air of the metropolis.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth of September, 1742, the fir&s;t &s;tone of the pre&s;ent building was laid; but it was three years before one wing was ready to be inhabited, and then the hou&s;e in Hatton Garden was given up.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep was to &s;olicit an exclu&s;ive &s;ub&s;cription to defray the expence of build|ing a chapel, which was begun to be erected in May, 1747, and two years afterwards
<PB N="161" REF="172">
the other wing was added. Such was the zeal which influenced the minds of per&s;ons for this favourite object, that perhaps no in&s;titution merely of a charitable nature was ever more munificently &s;upported.</P>
<P>The King gave two thou&s;and pounds, and one thou&s;and more towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a preacher. The Prince&s;s Dowager of Wales &s;even hundred and forty pounds; and before 1769, upwards of ten thou&s;and pounds had been collected at mu&s;ical performances in the chapel, under the direction of Mr. Handel, who gave an organ for the chapel, and the &s;core of his Me&s;&s;iah to the guardians.</P>
<P><Q>In 1755, the Hou&s;e of Commons took up the cau&s;e of the ho&s;pital, and at the &s;olici|tation of the guardians, Re&s;olved that, &startq;to render the ho&s;pital of general utility, all the children which &s;hould be offered un|der a certain age &s;hould be admitted, and proper places opened in all the counties
<PB N="162" REF="173">
of the kingdom for the reception of ex|po&s;ed &endq;and de&s;erted young children."</Q></P>
<P><Q>In June following, the guardians having received their fir&s;t grant from parliament of ten thou&s;and pounds, opened their doors to receive &startq;all children not exceeding two &endq;months old, which &s;hould be offered."</Q> The fir&s;t day of this indi&s;criminate admi&s;&s;ion, one hundred and &s;eventeen children were admitted. The next year thirty thou&s;and pounds more was granted, and the guardians extended the age of admi&s;&s;ion from two to &s;ix months. At the end of 1757, 5618 infants had been received, of whom had died 2311. Parliament continued their a&s;&s;i&s;tance with a mo&s;t liberal hand; the money grant|ed between the year 1755, and 1771, when all public &s;upport was withdrawn, being upwards of five hundred and &s;eventy thou|&s;and pounds&mdash;thirty-three thou&s;and five hundred and thirty pounds per ann. on an average.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="174"><Q>A receptacle &s;o &s;upported, with its doors continually open, and governed by per&s;ons of &s;entiment, could not want applications, too many of which were dictated rather by a want of feeling in the parent for its off|&s;pring, than of the means of rearing it; and in a little while the governors found it nece&s;&s;ary to adverti&s;e, that they &startq;would pro&s;ecute <HI>all per&s;ons, as well pari&s;h-officers as others, who &s;hould forcibly or fraudulently &s;end to the ho&s;pital any children without the &endq;con&s;ent of their parents,"</HI> and actually to pro&s;ecute in &s;everal in&s;tances.</Q></P>
<P>It was &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;anguine of the guardians, that the ho&s;pital would in time &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of the poor laws; but others were not deceived by this torrent of apparent humanity: The&s;e &s;aw that the univer&s;al admi&s;&s;ion had a ten|dency to promote licentiou&s;ne&s;s, by weak|ening the force of that fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of nature, the attachment of the parent to her own off|&s;pring.

The foremo&s;t of the&s;e advocates for morality was Mr. Hanway: He ob|&s;erved that the Foundling children, contrary to expectation, were not le&s;s viciou&s;ly in|clined, than tho&s;e bred in a populous city, and that to take infants from their parents, and &s;end them into a world, in which there was not one per&s;on to whom they owed a particular obedience, or who&s;e opinion or cen&s;ure it was incumbent on them to regard, was not the way to promote virtue, and the harmony of &s;ociety. In 1759, he publi&s;h|ed a pamphlet expre&s;sly to point out to the guardians and the world, the evil tendency which the practice mu&s;t have, e&s;pecially as the&s;e children were not intended to &s;erve the king, in the capacity of &s;oldiers, or &s;ailors, as in France, and &s;ome other countries hav|ing foundling ho&s;pitals. The wealth, how|ever, which rolled in from government every &s;e&s;&s;ion, carried every thing before it, and the indi&s;criminate admi&s;&s;ion of all child|ren,
<PB N="165" REF="176">
without que&s;tion, continued &s;ome years longer; but Mr. Hanway was not dazzled by this fal&s;e &s;plendour, nor intimidated by the oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e who, benefited by the plan, or fond of the di&s;po&s;al of public money, took up its defence. He never quitted the &s;ubject till he had gained his point; and time has &s;hewn mankind that he was right.</P>
<P>In 1771, parliament not perceiving &s;uch great public benefit to ari&s;e from the ho&s;pital as had been expected, withdrew all &s;upport, and the governors came to a re&s;olution to admit only &s;uch a number of children as their finances were adequate to the main|tenance of, and the&s;e monthly by ballot.</P>
<P>Whether a foundling ho&s;pital is an in&s;titu|tion proper for this kingdom, the only one in the world where there is an univer&s;al tax for the &s;upport of the indigent, is not for me to determine; but I &s;hould conceive that &s;ome &s;alutary regulations might have been borrowed
<PB N="166" REF="177">
from the foundling ho&s;pitals of other coun|tries. Among the rules of L'Hopital des En|fans-Trouv&eacute;s of Paris, I find the following: <Q>&startq;Les autres Enfans (tho&s;e not intended for the king's &s;ervice), lor&s;qu'ils auront at|teint l'&acirc;ge de &s;ix ans, &s;eront confi&eacute;s aux Bourgeois, Laboureurs, Marchands, ou Arti&s;ans, qui les demanderont pour les &eacute;lever ju&s;qu'&agrave; l'&acirc;ge de vingt-cinq ans.

For the boys, forty livres till they are twelve years old, and thirty livres from twelve to fourteen; for the girls, forty livres per ann. till they reach &s;ixteen years; it being pre&s;umed that the boys at fourteen, and the girls at &s;ixteen, will be u&s;eful to tho&s;e who have the charge of them, to whom they are required to be obe|dient as to their parents.</NOTE> Would not &s;uch a mode have been of &s;ervice here, when the guardians of this ho&s;pital were &s;o able to adopt and &s;upport it?</P>
<P>Lord Kaimes, in the violence of his re|sentment, would have every foundation of the kind "ra&s;ed to the ground," and proceeds &s;o far as to reprobate our poor laws in toto; but then he is con&s;trained to leave the unfortunate to the uncertain a&s;&s;i&s;tance of voluntary compa&s;&s;ion; a precarious &s;upport, more frequently extorted by the

The ho&s;pital nur&s;es certainly pre&s;erved the lives of many infants, who, if a judgment is to be drawn from general experience, would have died in the work|hou&s;es; but thanks to this generous and penetrating friend of mankind, pari&s;h poor infants in the metropolis are no longer the victims of the foul air of a workhou&s;e; for they are all obliged to be nur&s;ed out of town, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention particularly hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>MAGDALENE HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE next object of Mr. Hanway's philanthropy, was to provide an a&s;ylum for the women of the town. In all the coun|tries through which he had travelled, the promi&s;cuous commerce of the &s;exes was either expre&s;sly or tacitly allowed; but then it was confined to particular quarters of the city, and was therefore le&s;s open to general ob&s;ervation than here. His feeling heart could not but deplore the wretched &s;ituation of &s;o many beautiful females, who wandered publicly whither&s;oever inclination or nece&s;&s;ity led them, and obtruded their mi|&s;ery and their vice on his eye in every &s;treet.</P>
<P>As early as 1750, when he fir&s;t arrived from St. Peter&s;burgh, Mr. Robert Dingley
<PB N="170" REF="181">
communicated to him his plan for a Magda|lene hou&s;e; but Mr. Hanway advi&s;ed him not to make it public till &s;ome previous ob|&s;ervations had more fully evinced the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t appeals to the humanity of the public in behalf of the&s;e mi&s;erable beings, was made by Dr. Samuel John&s;on. Struck with the &s;ight of the ho&s;pital for the reception of de&s;erted infants, a natural train of &s;entiment led him to reflect on the fate of their mothers; whom he thus recommends to a place in the heart of the benevolent.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The&s;e were all once, if not virtuous, at lea&s;t innocent, and might &s;till have continued blamele&s;s and ea&s;y, but for the arts and in&s;inuations of tho&s;e who&s;e rank, fortune, or education furni&s;hed them with means to corrupt or to delude them. Let the libertine reflect a moment on the &s;ituation of that woman, who, be|ing for&s;aken by her betrayer, is reduced

to the nece&s;&s;ity of turning pro&s;titute for bread, and judge of the enormity of his &endq;guilt, by the evils which it produces.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It cannot be doubted but that numbers follow this dreadful cour&s;e of life with &s;hame, horror, and regret; but where can they hope for refuge? <HI>The world is not their friend, nor the world's law.</HI> Their &s;ighs, and tears, and groans, are criminal in the eye of their tyrants, the bully and the bawd, who fatten on their mi&s;ery, and threaten them with want or a gaol, if they &s;hew the lea&s;t de&s;ign of e&s;caping &endq;from their bondage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;How frequently have the gay and thoughtle&s;s, in their evening frolicks, &s;een a band of the&s;e mi&s;erable females, co|vered with rags, &s;hivering with cold, and pining with hunger, and without either pitying their calamities, or rerflecting up|on the cruelty of tho&s;e, who perhaps fir&s;t &s;educed them by care&s;&s;es of fondne&s;s, or

But &s;urely tho&s;e, whom pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t have already de|praved, have &s;ome claim to compa&s;&s;ion, from beings equally frail and fallible with them&s;elves; nor will they long groan in their pre&s;ent afflictions, if none were to refu&s;e them relief, but tho&s;e that owe their exemption from the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s only to &endq;their wi&s;dom and their virtue.</Q></P>
<P>"March 26, 1751."</P>
<P>Several other per&s;ons, particularly Mr. John Fielding, and Mr. Saunders Welch, endeavoured to excite the commi&s;eration of the public for the&s;e pitiable objects; but it
<PB N="173" REF="184">
was not till the year 1758, that any regular propo&s;al was made for their relief. In this year Mr. Dingley fir&s;t offered to the public his <Q>&startq;<HI>Propo&s;al for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Place of Re|ception &endq;for penitent Pro&s;titutes,"</HI> which he prefaced with an addre&s;s feelingly de&s;crip|tive of their mi&s;ery, and their incapacity to extricate them&s;elves from it by any efforts of their own.</Q> This propo&s;al Mr. Hanway recommended by a pamphlet and &s;everal letters, previou&s;ly prepared; and it met with the approbation of many re&s;pectable charac|ters. The plan, as originally concerted, was intended to include orphan girls of a tender age; but this part was abandoned for the pre&s;ent, though it now makes a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure among our charitable in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the &s;upport they had ex|perienced, a committee was formed of the following per&s;ons:

Who undertook to account for the &s;ub&s;crip|tions, which in a few weeks amounted to three thou&s;and pounds. They took a hou&s;e in Pre&s;cot-&s;treet, Goodman's Fields, and on the tenth of Augu&s;t, 1758, the fir&s;t eight women were received.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway continued to recommend the de&s;ign by all the means in his power, and procured the be&s;t accounts he could of the in&s;titutions of a &s;imilar kind in other countries, particularly that of Rome, founded &s;o early as the year 626, dedicated to Mary Magdalene; that of Naples, in 1324; of Seville, in 1550; and of Am&s;terdam, in 1596. After a trial of &s;ome years, the governors built their pre&s;ent ho&s;pital in St. George's Fields.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="186">Her Maje&s;ty conde&s;cended to be the pa|trone&s;s, and gave three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The number of women admitted from its commencement to the year 1786, is two thou&s;and four hundred and fifteen, of whom one thou&s;and five hundred and &s;eventy-one have been reconciled to their friends, or placed out in &s;ervice; many of the&s;e have &s;ince married, and are mothers of families; the re&s;t have died, proved refractory, or been di&s;charged at their own de&s;ire, unable to bear the re&s;traint. There are now &s;ixty women in the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>It is an unfavourable circum&s;tance to this in&s;titution, that for obvious rea&s;ons the go|vernors cannot make public the particular in&s;tances in which their endeavours have been attended with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;ome per&s;ons, &s;eeing the numbers of the wo|men of the town &s;till &s;o prodigious, are led from thence to think le&s;s highly of the ho&s;pital than it de&s;erves. The governors
<PB N="176" REF="187">
never hoped to be able completely to eradi|cate vice; but they have been the means of re&s;toring many to virtue, happine&s;s, and health, who mu&s;t, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, have been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway took great delight in en|tertaining the women who had left the ho&s;pital and &s;ettled in life, at his own hou&s;e; he encouraged their vi&s;its, inquired their manner of life and gave them his good advice, and, to &s;hew his &s;incerity, always accompanied it with a &s;mall pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IN 1759, Mr. Hanway publi&s;hed his <Q>&startq;Rea&s;ons for an additional Number of twelve thou&s;and Seamen to be employed in Time of &endq;Peace, in the Merchants Service."</Q> The de&s;ign of this work, which was promoted by Admiral Bo&s;cawen, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in the maritime line, was to
<PB N="177" REF="188">
prove, that as a commercial and military nation, having &s;uch remote and extended dominions, our trade ought to contribute more to its own exi&s;tence and &s;upport; and that to have a re&s;ource of &s;eamen always ready to act, whenever our enemies &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary, would prevent the ex|pence and inconvenience of pre&s;&s;ing, and &s;et us on equal terms with our foes, even on the fir&s;t breaking out of ho&s;tilities. The manner in which he propo&s;ed to form and &s;upport this augmentation of &s;eamen, was by compelling ma&s;ters in the merchants &s;ervice to take an additional number of &s;ailors, in proportion to the tonnage of their ve&s;&s;els, and allowing bounties on certain articles of com|merce, as an equivalent to the additional number of hands.</P>
<P>The encouragement of &s;eamen was al|ways a favourite object of our author's at|tention; and he knew from experience as well as ob&s;ervation, how much the &s;afety
<PB N="178" REF="189">
and pro&s;perity of our country depend on this u&s;eful body of men. He &s;aw likewi&s;e that it required a long time to convert a mere landman into a tolerable mariner; and &s;uch was his attachment to this favourite plan, and his confidence of its expediency, that he never lo&s;t &s;ight of it: In 1770, he publi&s;hed a &s;econd edition of the above work: At the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war he endeavoured to make the marine &s;ociety contribute towards the breed of &s;eamen, by education as well as clothing; and I have heard him &s;ay, with great regret, <Q>&startq;I fear I &s;hall not carry my object, and yet the mo&s;t popular ob|jection I find is, that the practice is an imitation of our neighbours the French; as if we were bound to imitate them only in the cut of a coat, or the &s;hape of a &endq;hat!"</Q></P>

<HEAD>STEPNEY SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1758, Mr. Hanway entered his name as a &s;ub&s;criber to the <HI>Stepney Society</HI>, an in&s;titution calculated to prevent mi&s;ery, and encourage maritime employment; and which, though it has lately declined, de&s;erves well to be recorded.</P>
<P>In the year 1674, at the conclu&s;ion of the war with Holland, a few ma&s;ters of &s;hips in the merchants &s;ervice entered into a &s;mall &s;ub&s;cription to be appropriated for the <Q>&startq;<HI>Apprenticing out Orphans, and the &endq;Children of the Poor to Marine Trades;"</HI> but either for want of a per&s;on at their head, who had abilities to conduct a plan of the kind, or &s;ome other cau&s;e not now to be ea&s;ily traced out, very little was done; and the &s;ociety was not much known till the
<PB N="180" REF="191">
year 1729, when Sir Charles Wager ac|cepted the office of &s;teward.</Q> The patronage of this brave and benevolent man greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;ociety, and afterwards per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank and fortune were &s;tew|ards. The lords of the Admiralty, commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Navy, and Victualling, and other departments of the marine gave their countenance and &s;upport to it.</P>
<P>Previous to the year 1758, the &s;ociety had u&s;ually placed out &s;ixteen boys as apprentices, chiefly to water-borne bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, every year, with each of whom they gave five pounds apprentice fee; but their finances were too &s;lender to enable them to do any thing for the in&s;truction or comfort of the lads in their apprentice&s;hip. It is remarkable that from the commencement of this fraternity to the time when Mr. Hanway became a &s;teward, almo&s;t their whole fund had been collected at their annual fea&s;t. The ma&s;ters, probably, &s;truck out the idea originally at
<PB N="181" REF="192">
a dinner, and in the benevolence of their hearts, continued to dine, and to contribute once in the cour&s;e of every year for &s;o long a period. Their names, I believe, never appeared; the &s;tewards were annually ap|pointed to provide the dinner, and &s;ee to the di&s;tribution of the money collected. It had been u&s;ual to appropriate a part of their little fund to the clothing a few boys to &s;erve as volunteers on board the king's &s;hips; but Mr. Hanway perceiving that the ma|rine &s;ociety made &s;uch ample provi&s;ion for all boys inclined to &s;erve in the navy, pre|vailed on his colleagues to appropriate the whole to the original purpo&s;e of apprentic|ing out boys in the mercantile and trading departments. He likewi&s;e obtained a prefer|ence to be given to the parent who was burthened with a large family: The <HI>Jus trium Liberorum</HI> of the Romans (which I apprehend was originally a Lacedemonian in&s;titution) was always a favourite law with
<PB N="182" REF="193">
him; although he him&s;elf had never any children.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ame year, 1759, he promoted a &s;ub&s;cription for furni&s;hing the Briti&s;h troops &s;erving in Germany and America, with u&s;eful articles of clothing, &amp;c. &s;uitable to the climates they were in. A part of the &s;ub&s;cription, which amounted in the whole to &s;even thou&s;and four hundred and &s;ix pounds, was re&s;erved for the relief of the widows and orphans of &s;uch as were &s;lain or died in the &s;ervice; and this kind token of the attention, which their countrymen paid to the &s;oldiers, contributed much to animate them in the tran&s;actions of this year, &s;o glorious to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>

<HEAD>VAILS GIVING.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time Mr. Hanway &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e the ab&s;urd cu&s;tom of
<PB N="183" REF="194">
<HI>Vails Giving</HI>, which had arrived at a very extravagant pitch, e&s;pecially among the &s;er|vants of the great, and was detrimental to the rich as well as the poor. The man of power and influence mu&s;t lo&s;e much of the plea&s;ure of life, if he is deprived of the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;cience enables them to in&s;truct or amu&s;e, but who&s;e circum|&s;tances prevent them from communicating their knowledge at a repeated expence to them&s;elves. It was Mr. Hanway who an|&s;wered the kind reproach of a friend in a high &s;tation for not coming oftener to dine with him, by &s;aying, <Q>&startq;Indeed I cannot &endq;afford it."</Q></P>
<P>In 1762, he publi&s;hed <Q>&startq;Eight Let|ters &endq;to the Duke of &mdash;," <HI>on this cu&s;tom</HI>.</Q> The nobleman here meant was the Duke of Newca&s;tle. The letters are written in that humorous &s;tyle, which is mo&s;t attractive of general notice, and was be&s;t adapted to the &s;ubject. If I am not mi&s;taken, it was Sir Timothy Waldo that
<PB N="184" REF="195">
fir&s;t put him on this plan: Sir Timothy had dined with the Duke of N&mdash;&mdash;, and on his leaving the hou&s;e, was contri|buting to the &s;upport and in&s;olence of a train of &s;ervants who lined the hall; and at la&s;t put a crown into the hand of the Cook, who returned it, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;Sir, I do not &endq;take &s;ilver"&mdash;<HI>Don't you indeed?</HI></Q> &s;aid the worthy Baronet, putting it in his pocket, <HI>then I do not give gold</HI>. Among the ludi|crous circum&s;tances in Mr. Hanway's letters, is one which happened to him&s;elf. He was paying the &s;ervants of a re&s;pectable friend for a dinner, which their ma&s;ter had invited him to, one by one as they appeared: <Q>&startq;Sir, your great coat:" <HI>a &s;hilling</HI>&mdash;"Your hat:" <HI>a &s;hilling</HI>&mdash;"Stick:" &s;hilling&mdash;"Um|brella:" &endq;<HI>&s;hilling</HI>&mdash;"Sir, your gloves:"</Q> <HI>Why, friend, you may keep the gloves; they are not worth a &s;hilling.</HI></P>
<P>By degrees this odious cu&s;tom became le&s;s fa&s;hionable, and it received its la&s;t &s;troke
<PB N="185" REF="196">
from Mr. Dod&s;l$$'s excellent farce of High Life below Stairs, which expo&s;ed to the great, a part of their dome&s;tic oeconomy that they had not before examined. But, bani&s;hed from the man&s;ions of the great, it &s;eems to be gaining ground among the mid|dling cla&s;&s;es; and the married will, I hope, not think them&s;elves neglected by their &s;ingle acquaintances, whil&s;t the&s;e can dine at the coffee-hou&s;e or their own homes, at a cheaper rate than with their friends, and at the &s;ame time have the privilege of con|&s;ulting their own appetites.</P>

<HEAD>PRESERVATION OF INFANT PARISH POOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE progre&s;&s;ion that I had laid down for my&s;elf in this relation, and which, though irregular, was the mo&s;t intelligible that I could form, now brings me to an in|&s;tance
<PB N="186" REF="197">
of Mr. Hanway's per&s;everance and philanthropy, the mo&s;t arduous and &s;plendid of all his public undertakings. I mean the <HI>Pre&s;ervation of the Lives of the infant Pari&s;h Poor, within the Bills of Mortality</HI>. It was not &s;upported by a &s;ub&s;cription, the publi|cation of which encourages an increa&s;e of benefactors, and adds to the &s;elf-compla|cency attendant on a charitable act, the ju&s;tifiable reflection that it will be made known. Alone and una&s;&s;i&s;ted, he explored the then mi&s;erable and unhealthy habitations of the pari&s;h poor in the&s;e crowded cities, expo&s;ed his tender lungs to the pe&s;tilential air of the workhou&s;e &s;ick-wards, and pro|cured a complete account of the interior management of every workhou&s;e in and near the metropolis. I feel my&s;elf incapable of doing ju&s;tice to his labours in this work, or of expre&s;&s;ing my own ideas of its excel|lence; they only can form an adequate idea of it, who have had opportunities of
<PB N="187" REF="198">
knowing what deva&s;tation was made in the lives of pari&s;h infants before he exerted him&s;elf in their behalf, and comparing it with the pre&s;ent improved practice.</P>
<P>In the journey which he had taken to Paris, and through Holland, he had vi&s;ited all the hou&s;es for the reception of the poor, particularly tho&s;e of Paris, and the found|ling ho&s;pitals of France, and noted what|ever he thought might be adopted here with advantage. From the year 1757 to 1762, his principal employment was vi&s;iting the workhou&s;es in the&s;e cities; and as he found it impo&s;&s;ible to work a complete reform all at once, he confined his attention to in|fants. He publi&s;hed his ob&s;ervations as they were made, in the hope of engaging his fellow citizens in the cau&s;e; but his accounts were &s;o melancholy, that they were gene|rally di&s;believed: To enforce credit he ha|zarded making a ho&s;t of enemies, and pub|li&s;hed all the particulars of the facts he had
<PB N="188" REF="199">
&s;tated, giving the names of every pari&s;h of|ficer, whatever was his rank in life, under who&s;e hands many infants had died by neg|lect.</P>
<P>During the year 1765, in the workhou&s;e of St. Clement Danes, one nur&s;e, Mary Poole, had twenty-three children committed to her care, and on the twenty-fifth of January 1766, eighteen were dead, two had been di&s;charged, and three only remained alive.</P>
<P>Of &s;eventy-eight children received into the workhou&s;e of the united pari&s;hes of St. Andrew, and St. George, Holborn, in the year 1765, &s;ixty-four were dead before 1766.</P>
<P>Of forty-eight received into the work|hou&s;e of St. Luke, Middle&s;ex, in 1764, for nurture, died within the year, thirty-&s;even.</P>
<P>Of nineteen received into the workhou&s;e of St. George, Middle&s;ex, in 1765, died before 1766, &s;ixteen.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="200">In &s;ome popular pari&s;hes, not one child was living, of all that were received, in the cour&s;e of twelve months.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the alarming in&s;tances of the mortality of infants, which Mr. Hanway traced out. Wherever his gene|ral &s;tatements were di&s;puted, he publi&s;hed a certificate &s;igned with his name, mention|ing the name of each particular infant, the day of its birth or admi&s;&s;ion, the time it lived, and the name of its nur&s;e.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e made a journey through the greate&s;t part of England, to compare the mortality in the country workhou&s;es with that of the metropolis, and was convinced that the greater proportion of deaths in the&s;e cities, was owing to the air of the work|hou&s;es being too con&s;ined and impure for the lungs of new-born infants. His next effort was to get all pari&s;h infants &s;ent to the Foundling Ho&s;pital, and a great many were put under the care of the guardians, and
<PB N="190" REF="201">
pre&s;erved. He had obtained an act of par|liament in 1761, obliging every London pari&s;h to keep an annual regi&s;ter of all the infants received, di&s;charged, and dead; and from the&s;e regi&s;ters, which were directed to be publi&s;hed yearly by the company of pa|ri&s;h clerks, he &s;elected, from time to time, every thing that could tend to convince the public of the nece&s;&s;ity of an alteration. He &s;temmed every oppo&s;ition by &s;tating facts, and at length in 1766, after a per&s;everance hardly to be equalled, by his own exertions, and at his own &s;ole expence, he obtained an act, 7. Geo. III. cap. 39, which directs, that, <HI>all Pari&s;h Infants belonging to the Pari&s;hes within the Bills of Mortality, &s;hall not be nur&s;ed in the Workhou&s;es, but be &s;ent to nur&s;e a certain Number of Miles out of Town, until they are &s;ix Years old, under the Care of Guardians, to be elected triennially, for the expre&s;s Purpo&s;e of tak|ing Care of them</HI>. This &s;tatute likewi&s;e autho|rizes pari&s;h officers within the bills of morta|lity,
<PB N="191" REF="202">
to bind their male apprentices till they at|tain the age of twenty-one years, in&s;tead of twenty-four, as required by the former laws, a privilege which has been &s;ince extended to the kingdom at large.</P>
<P>If I were to &s;tate the number of infants, who&s;e lives appeared, by the regi&s;ters of the next five years, to have been pre&s;erved by this act, or which are now pre&s;erved annually by it, I &s;hould, mo&s;t probably, be di&s;be|lieved. <Q>The poor called it &startq;the act for &endq;keeping children alive;" and thou&s;ands now living may impute their exi&s;tence to the judicious interference of this good and &s;en&s;ible man.</Q> I think I now &s;ee him going from one workhou&s;e to another in the morning, and from one member of parlia|ment to another in the afternoon, for day after day, and year after year, with &s;teady and unwearied patience, enduring every re|buff, an&s;wering every objection, and accom|modating him&s;elf to every humour for the
<PB N="192" REF="203">
furtherance of his benevolent de&s;ign, which he e&s;tabli&s;hed at la&s;t, almo&s;t without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Among the various in&s;tances of neglect, which came to his notice in the cour&s;e of this enterprize, I cannot but men|tion one: He ob&s;erved that a certain over&s;eer refu&s;ed to allow the mother of a new-born infant more than one &s;hilling and &s;ix-pence a week for nur&s;ing it, and remarked to him, that this pittance was le&s;s than he gave to &s;trange nur&s;es. <Q>"Yes," &s;ays the con&s;cien|tious officer, &startq;but you don't con&s;ider that this woman will take care of her own child, and it may be on our hands a long time, whereas we &s;hall, perhaps, hear no &endq;more of the other!"</Q></P>
<P>The many u&s;eful and public &s;pirited plans which Mr. Hanway had promoted, for the welfare of his fellow creatures, had now
<PB N="193" REF="204">
rendered his character mo&s;t re&s;pectably po|pular. His di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and the &s;incerity of his intentions were con&s;picuous to all. His name appeared to every propo&s;al for the benefit of mankind, and brought with it more than his own benefaction; for people were a&s;&s;ured that at lea&s;t their bounty would be faithfully and carefully expended. He made his appearance at Court &s;ometimes; but I have not heard, that either openly or privately he &s;olicited a reward for his &s;er|vices, although he was now acquainted with &s;ome of tho&s;e who had the di&s;pen&s;ation of court favours. He was not however &s;uffered to wa&s;te his little fortune entirely in the &s;ervice of others: Five citizens of Lon|don, of whom the late Mr. <HI>Hoare</HI>, the banker, was one, waited on Lord Bute, the then mini&s;ter, in a body; and in their own names, and the names of their fellow citizens, reque&s;ted &s;ome notice might be taken of him; and, on the &s;eventeenth of
<PB N="194" REF="205">
July, 1762, he was appointed, by patent, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for victualling the navy.</P>
<P>With the increa&s;e of income, which this appointment produced, he thought he might extend his acquaintance, and took a hou&s;e in Red Lion Square, the principal rooms of which he furni&s;hed, and decorated with paintings and emblematical devices, in a &s;tyle peculiar to him&s;elf. <Q>"I found," he was u&s;ed to &s;ay, when &s;peaking of the&s;e orna|ments, &startq;that my countrymen and women were not <HI>au fait</HI> in the art of conver&s;a|tion, and that in&s;tead of recurring to their cards, when the di&s;cour&s;e began to flag, the minutes between the time of a&s;&s;embling, and the placing the card tables, are &s;pent in an irk&s;ome &s;u&s;pen&s;e; for conver&s;ation has no charms when the mind is not en|gaged in it.

I have pre&s;ented them with objects the mo&s;t attractive that I could imagine, and &s;uch as cannot ea&s;ily be examined without exciting amu&s;ing and in&s;tructive di&s;cour&s;e &endq;&mdash;and when that fails, there are the cards."</Q></P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1765, Mr. Hanway publi&s;hed his <HI>"Thoughts on Mu&s;ic,"</HI> a work which he was induced to undertake, by his frequent at|tendance at the performances of the Aca|demy of Ancient Mu&s;ic. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed that he was entirely unacquainted with his &s;ubject: He had not even a di&s;|tant idea of harmony; and, as is the ca&s;e, I believe, with all per&s;ons who have not the rudiments of the art, he felt no mu&s;ic until, by hearing it &s;everal times, it be|came, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, familiar to his ear. Speaking of this &s;cience &s;ome years after
<PB N="196" REF="207">
the publication of his work, I endeavoured by means of a harp&s;ichord to de&s;cribe the octave, the manner in which concords are produced by the vibration of &s;trings of dif|ferent lengths, the change which is made in the &s;tyle and effect of the &s;ame air, when tran&s;po&s;ed into a different key, &amp;c. but I found my&s;elf unintelligible. It is true, that in his book he does not profe&s;s to &s;peak much of the theory of the art; but confines him&s;elf in a great mea&s;ure to pointing out how it might be be&s;t conducted to encou|rage virtuous principles, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the fer|vour of religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>ON Saturday the eighteenth of May 1765, a fire happened at Montreal, in the province of Quebec, which, in three hours, con&s;umed a fourth part of the city; one hundred and eight principal hou&s;es, in|habited
<PB N="197" REF="208">
by two hundred and fifteen fami|lies, with their merchandize, furniture, and apparel, to the amount of eighty-&s;even thou|&s;and five hundred and eighty pounds. The &s;ufferers were a loyal, obedient, and laborious people, and before this accident were re|covering from the calamities of war. Mr. Thornton, Mr. Hanway, and Mr. Fowler Walker, as agents for the &s;ufferers, peti|tioned the king in council for a brief, which they obtained, and collected thereon eight thou&s;and four hundred and fifteen pounds.</P>
<P><Q>In the &startq;<HI>Ca&s;e of the Canadians at Mon|treal,"</HI> &endq;Mr. Hanway thus endeavours to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of his fellow citizens.</Q> <Q>&startq;Of all the calamities incident to human life, none are more dreadful than fire. Scarce was the &s;word well &s;heathed, and the widow's tears dried up, when this con|flagration happened. Under their former governors grown de&s;perate by repeated defeats, the&s;e people had experienced the
<PB N="198" REF="209">
calamities of war, not with us only, but al&s;o with the &s;avage Indians. They had likewi&s;e felt the affliction of famine, and the interruption of their trade, and they dreaded the &s;ame hard fate from us; but they were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by a different rule of conduct. The remains of their &s;ub&s;tance was improving when this melancholy event fell upon them. Many e&s;caped from the fire, who have no food to &s;atisfy their hunger, no raiment to cover their nakedne&s;s, no hou&s;e to guard them from the inclemency of the &s;ky; and &s;hall not the&s;e various di&s;tre&s;&s;es move our compa&s;&s;ion? Let us not think they have no claim upon us; but &s;tretch forth our arms to relieve them; in hopes, one day, to receive the mercy which the great Parent of mankind will extend to all his obedient children, when the whole &endq;earth &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved by fire."</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ub&s;cription was immediately begun,
<PB N="199" REF="210">
exclu&s;ive of the brief, and the amount tran&s;mitted to Montreal, chiefly in &s;ilver, with two fire engines, and a marble bu&s;t of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, to be &s;et up in the town.</P>
<P>The very next year a dreadful fire broke out in Bridge Town in Barbadoes, which con&s;umed buildings and property to the amount of near one hundred thou&s;and pounds. A &s;ub&s;cription was opened, in which Mr. Hanway was a principal actor, and fourteen thou&s;and eight hundred and eighty-&s;ix pounds were collected, and tran&s;|mitted to a committee appointed at Barba|does to di&s;tribute it to the unfortunate &s;uf|ferers.</P>
<P>FROM the year 1766 to 1772, he was engaged in his official bu&s;ine&s;s, and in &s;up|porting the charitable in&s;titutions which he
<PB N="200" REF="211">
had founded or intere&s;ted him&s;elf in, with|out attempting any new plan of con&s;e|quence. In this year he fir&s;t endea|voured to do &s;omething towards alleviating the mi&s;eries of young <HI>chimney &s;weepers</HI>. Be|&s;ides the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the&s;e helple&s;s beings, which are open to general ob&s;ervation, &s;uch as a contortion of the limbs, and the pre|vention of their growth, they are liable to a di&s;ea&s;e peculiar to their occupation, now known by the name of the <HI>chimney &s;weeper's cancer</HI>. Four children have been brought together into a workhou&s;e, all afflicted with this dreadful and incurable di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The difficulty was, what kind of relief could be afforded them. He knew well that there mu&s;t be &s;ome to perform the lowe&s;t offices of life, who&s;e drudgery &s;hould contribute to the general conveniency; and that to give them even a tolerable education, in&s;tead of alleviating their mi&s;ery, would add to its poignancy; but he con&s;idered
<PB N="201" REF="212">
that however abject, they were &s;till human beings, and intitled as &s;uch to the privileges of humanity. His fir&s;t attempt was, by binding them regularly as apprentices, to place them more effectually under the cog|nizance of the magi&s;trates; and a &s;ub&s;crip|tion was promoted to defray the expence, and furni&s;h them with clothes. A great many were bound, &s;ome ma&s;ters were pro&s;ecuted for cruel behaviour to their boys; and no incon&s;iderable portion of mi&s;ery was pre|vented.</P>
<P>Several years after he renewed his re|pre&s;entations in behalf of the&s;e mi&s;erable beings, and leave was given to bring in a bill for the future regulation of chimney &s;weepers young apprentices; but death put an end to his exertions in their behalf, and they mu&s;t now look for relief from other hands.</P>
<P><PB N="2O2" REF="213">IN 1773, he engaged in the que&s;tion re|lative to <HI>the mo&s;t proper bread to be a&s;&s;ized for general u&s;e</HI>. He was the commi&s;&s;ioner &s;u|perintending the baking for the fleet; and his chief end was to convince the public that the white&s;t bread was not the mo&s;t nu|tritive. He proved that the whole produce of the grain, except only the out&s;ide hull, made the be&s;t food; and that the London bread owed its colour not to nature, but to an artificial mixture. The late Dr. Fothergill gave his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by a Treati&s;e, tending to prove that the <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> bread was an article of difficult dige&s;tion. But their labours have not &s;ucceeded: The fact has been univer|&s;ally allowed, and univer&s;ally neglected, al|though of &s;uch con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="214">IN the year 1774, young Calas, &s;on of the unfortunate merchant, who had been unju&s;tly broke on the wheel at Toulou&s;e, for the &s;uppo&s;ed murder of his &s;on, came to England to &s;olicit the contributions of men of property and compa&s;&s;ion, for the &s;upport of the remains of his family. I had read Mr. Voltaire's Memoire of the tran&s;ac|tion; and when he waited on Mr. Hanway, with the curio&s;ity and warmth of a young mind, I inquired of Mon&s;ieur Calas &s;ome particulars, which Mr. Voltaire had not mentioned. He was at that time a tall thin young man, with &s;harp features, and a &s;ettled melancholy on his countenance. He an&s;wered my que&s;tions with patience, but very &s;hortly; &s;poke with reverence of Mr. Voltaire as the &s;aviour of his mother, his brother, and him&s;elf; but &s;eemed unwilling
<PB N="204" REF="215">
to enter into particulars of an event, which he could not reflect on without &s;orrow. He under&s;tood no Engli&s;h, and never &s;poke but to an&s;wer &s;ome que&s;tion, leaving all to the repre&s;entations contained in Mr. Vol|taire's Memorial.</P>
<P>IN 1775, Mr. Hanway endeavoured to procure &s;ome alteration in the police of the&s;e cities. His favourite plan was <HI>Solitude in Im|pri&s;onment</HI>, on the principle, that the pri&s;oner might become better by reflection, and could not grow wor&s;e by conver&s;ation with more experienced malefactors. This principle &s;eems to meet the ideas of magi&s;trates in general, and is adopted in many pri&s;ons with &s;ucce&s;s; and it may be hoped that the time is not far off, when the extreme &s;everity of our crimi|nal laws &s;hall no longer render it impo&s;&s;i|ble to execute them; when rewards &s;hall
<PB N="205" REF="216">
be offered to tho&s;e who, by exerting them|&s;elves in puni&s;hing &s;mall offences, &s;hall find it their intere&s;t to prevent, not encourage, the commi&s;&s;ion of capital crimes; and when it &s;hall not be nece&s;&s;ary for pro&s;ecutors or juries to render the laws uncertain, by a humane but capricious lenity.</P>
<P>FEBRUARY 1776, Mr. Matthias, the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Hamburgh, acquainted the Earl of Suffolk, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, that there were &s;everal &s;hips at that place, who&s;e owners were willing to let them as tran&s;|ports, to be u&s;ed in the war with America; and the lords of the Admiralty directed the Victualling Board to &s;end one of their com|mi&s;&s;ioners to contract for the &s;upply of pro|vi&s;ions for the troops. Mr. Hanway was now in his &s;ixty-fourth year; yet he en|gaged him&s;elf to conduct this bu&s;ine&s;s, and went to Hamburgh, and completed his em|ba&s;&s;y with the activity of a young man.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="217">About this time he formed a plan for an ho&s;pital for the relief of per&s;ons afflicted with the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, in the ea&s;t end of the town. A &s;ub&s;cription was opened, and the hou&s;e, which had formerly been the Magdalene Ho&s;pital, in Goodman's Fields was taken. But the &s;ub&s;criptions decrea&s;ing in a few years, the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide. He computed that one third of the number of tho&s;e who, in the bills of mortality, are &s;aid to die of con&s;umptions, fall victims in reality to the ravages of this loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e, and the more deadly effects of ig|norant per&s;ons to cure it.</P>

<HEAD>MARITIME SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<P>THE encouragement of &s;eamen was an object never from Mr. Hanway's heart. Having by his con&s;tant attention brought the Marine Society to a very re&s;pectable and permanent condition, he thought he &s;hould
<PB N="207" REF="218">
&s;till add to the benefit of the &s;ervice, by giving a naval education to the &s;ons of tho&s;e brave officers, who might fall in defence of their country. To this end he framed the plan of the <HI>Maritime School</HI>, which he &s;ub|mitted to Lord Spencer, the Duke of Bol|ton, Lord Hawke, and Sir George Pococke, who approving the de&s;ign, a &s;ub&s;cription was opened, a hou&s;e taken at Chel&s;ea, and in March 1779, eleven &s;cholars were ad|mitted.</P>
<P>The annual &s;ub&s;cription ro&s;e to eight hun|dred pounds. In 1782, the government of Bombay &s;ent over a &s;ub&s;cription collected there, amounting to one thou&s;and and &s;e|venty pounds. His Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland accepted the office of Pre&s;ident on the Death of Lord Hawke: the orphans of many de&s;erving officers, par|ticularly the gallant but unfortunate Cap|tain Macartney, were received, and the in|&s;titution, with an income equal to its ex|pence,
<PB N="208" REF="219">
&s;eemed likely to increa&s;e in &s;plendour and acquire &s;tability; when an unlucky event took place, which, by &s;owing the &s;eeds of animo&s;ity among &s;ome of the Go|vernors, in a few years greatly le&s;&s;ened the finances of the &s;ociety. A certain per&s;onage, one of the governors, on the reque&s;t of a com|mittee of governors, appointed for the pur|po&s;e, of whom Mr. Hanway was one, had conde&s;cended to promi&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in pro|curing the time the &s;cholars might remain in the &s;chool, to be allowed as part of the &s;ix years nece&s;&s;ary for a lieutenant's qualification. Mr. Hanway, impatient of the lea&s;t delay, ap|plied &s;eparately to the fir&s;t lord of the Ad|miralty, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which interfer|ence not only gave offence to the nobleman, but being defended by &s;ome of the gover|nors, and complained of by the re&s;t, di&s;|turbed that harmony which had before reigned, and is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of every undertaking of this kind. A va|riety
<PB N="209" REF="220">
of circum&s;tances concurring with this, the &s;ub&s;criptions decrea&s;ed; and the in&s;titu|tion is now barely kept alive by the exer|tions of the two principal ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>On the failure of this attempt, Mr. Han|way endeavoured to incorporate a &s;eminary for naval in&s;truction, with the plan of the Marine Society, which he hoped would in time be adopted by every county in the kingdom. He was &s;o fully per&s;uaded of the expediency of this de&s;ign, that he tried every means to e&s;tabli&s;h it; but the gene|rality of the governors, although convinced that &s;omething might be done by the &s;ociety in time of peace, towards preparing for war when it &s;hould happen, thought Mr. Han|way's plan too exten&s;ive to be adopted, and the bu&s;ine&s;s ended in &s;itting up a &s;hip to lie on the Thames, where boys might be harboured and taught the rudiments of Na|vigation, and be ready for any commande$ who might demand them.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="221">In 1783, finding his health decline, he determined to re&s;ign his office at the victual|ling board, which he did on the &s;econd of October that year, and immediately re$eived a grant of his whole &s;alary by way of a pen|&s;ion, to continue for life. This favour he owed to the e&s;teem which his Maje&s;ty, to whom he was per&s;onally known, entertained of him; excited by his various exertions in behalf of his country and mankind.</P>
<P>He was now relea&s;ed from his mo&s;t ma|terial bu&s;ine&s;s; but did not think it would conduce to his happine&s;s to lead an idle life: He engaged again in behalf of the chimney &s;weepers boys, and promoted, by every means in his power, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Sunday &s;chools, which are now in a fair way to be adopted in every county in England.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e promoted a &s;ub&s;cription for the relief of the many black poor people, who wandered about the metropolis in ex|treme di&s;tre&s;s, and the lords of the Trea|&s;ury
<PB N="211" REF="222">
&s;econded the de&s;ign, by directing mo|ney, as far as fourteen pounds a head, to be i&s;&s;ued to the committee, to enable them to &s;end the blacks to &s;uch places abroad as might be fixed on; a plan, which, if it can be executed faithfully, mu&s;t tend to relieve the mi&s;ery of the&s;e poor people, and pre|vent the unnatural connections between black per&s;ons and white; the di&s;agree|able con&s;equences of which make their ap|pearance but too frequently in our &s;treets.</P>
<P>In the Summer of 1786, his health de|clined &s;o vi&s;ibly, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to attend only to that. He had long felt the approach of a di&s;order in the bladder, which, increa&s;ing by degrees, cau&s;ed a &s;trangury, and at length, on the fifth of September 1786, put a period to a life &s;pent almo&s;t entirely in the &s;ervice of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>It may truly be &s;aid of this good man, that nothing in his life became him better
<PB N="212" REF="223">
than his dying: During the progre&s;s of a tedious, and &s;ometimes painful illne&s;s, he never once expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t impatience; but &s;aw the approach of his di&s;&s;olution with|out regret. When he grew &s;o weak as to be confined to his bed, he reque&s;ted his phy&s;icians to &s;peak frankly, and without re&s;erve of his di&s;order; and when con|vinced that he could not recover, he &s;ent and paid all his trade&s;men; took leave of his mo&s;t intimate friends; dictated &s;ome letters to ab&s;ent acquaintances; had the &s;acrament admini&s;tered to him, and di&s;cour&s;ed, with the mo&s;t cheerful compo&s;ure, of his affairs. His lungs, of which he had always been particularly careful, perhaps becau&s;e they were originally weak, remained perfect to the la&s;t moment; and he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;a|tisfaction that his mind had never <HI>wandered</HI> or been <HI>perplexed</HI> throughout the whole of his illne&s;s. In the morning previous to his death, he &s;aid to an intimate friend, <Q>&startq;I

<P>The evening of the night on which he died, he de&s;ired to put on a fine ruffled &s;hirt; gave up his keys; di&s;po&s;ed of &s;ome trinkets, and had his will read to him. About midnight a coldne&s;s &s;eized the extre|mities, which, however, was removed &s;e|veral times, and the circulation re&s;tored, by frictions, which he him&s;elf directed. The la&s;t time he bade his attendant rub his leg, on which the fatal chilne&s;s had &s;eized; he uttered a &s;igh, which alarming the per&s;on, he cea&s;ed the friction a few moments: the
<PB N="214" REF="225">
cold increa&s;ed; he was &s;en&s;ible of the im|mediate approach of his death: His lungs yet played with freedom: The la&s;t breath e&s;caped him in the mid&s;t of a &s;entence, which began with the word "Chri&s;t!" The cau&s;e of his death appeared to be an indu|ration of the pro&s;trate gland.</P>
<P>Such were the la&s;t moments of Jonas Hanway, E&s;q. and &s;uch, if the intellectual faculties are pre&s;erved, may be tho&s;e of all who live like him. He prepared for death with as much cheerfulne&s;s as he would have prepared for a journey. It was his &s;tudy to be always ready for the event, whenever it &s;hould happen, and he was carele&s;s about the time. About twelve months before his death, whil&s;t he was &s;tanding in his &s;tudy reading a paper, he fell down as &s;uddenly as if he had been &s;truck by light|ning.

<HEAD><HI>PART III.</HI> REMARKABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE LIFE OF JONAS HANWAY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the preceding narrative, the in|telligent reader will, I conceive, be able to form a tolerably correct idea of the charac|ter of Mr. Hanway. He will &s;ee that the love of human kind was the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion in his brea&s;t, and that when once he had
<PB N="218" REF="228">
engaged in any office of general benevo|lence, no ob&s;tacles could &s;tand before his active per&s;everance; but &s;uch was the e&s;|teem which the public entertained of him, that I tru&s;t I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in attempting to de&s;cribe him in the line of dome&s;tick life, and at tho&s;e hours (they were very few) when public concerns did not engage his attention. The curio&s;ity of future times may de&s;ire to know every circum&s;tance re|lating to a man, to whom po&s;terity will ac|knowledge it&s;elf &s;o much indebted.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway in his per&s;on was of the middle &s;ize, of a thin &s;pare habit, but well &s;haped; his limbs were fa&s;hioned with the nice&s;t &s;ymmetry. In the latter years of his life he &s;tooped very much, and when he walked, found it conduce to ea&s;e to let his head incline towards one &s;ide. When he went fir&s;t to Ru&s;&s;ia at the age of thirty, his face was full and comely, and his per&s;on altogether &s;uch as obtained for him the ap|pellation
<PB N="219" REF="229">
of the <HI>"Hand&s;ome Engli&s;hman."</HI> But the &s;hock which his health received in Per|&s;ia, made him much thinner; and though he recovered his health, &s;o as to live in England twenty &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years without any material illne&s;s, he never recovered his plumpne&s;s.</P>
<P>His features were &s;mall, but without the in&s;ignificance which commonly attends &s;mall features. His countenance was inte|re&s;ting, &s;en&s;ible, and calculated to in&s;pire reverence. His blue eyes had never been brilliant; but they expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t hu|manity and benevolence; and when he &s;poke, the animation of his countenance and the tone of his voice were &s;uch as &s;eemed to carry conviction with them even to the mind of a &s;tranger. When he endeavoured to &s;oothe di&s;tre&s;s, or point out to any wretch who had &s;trayed, the comforts of a virtuous life, he was peculiarly impre&s;&s;ive; and
<PB N="220" REF="230">
every thing that he &s;aid had an air of con|&s;ideration and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>In his dre&s;s, as far as was con&s;i&s;tent with his ideas of health and ea&s;e, he accommo|dated him&s;elf to the prevailing fa&s;hion. As it was frequently nece&s;&s;ary for him to ap|pear in polite circles, on unexpected occa|&s;ions, he u&s;ually wore dre&s;s clothes, with a large French bag: His hat, ornamented with a gold button, was of a &s;ize and fa&s;hion to be worn as well under the arm as on the head. When it rained, a &s;mall <HI>parapluie</HI> de|fended his face and wig. Thus he was al|ways prepared to enter into any company, without impropriety, or the appearance of negligence. His dre&s;s for &s;et public occa|&s;ions was a &s;uit of rich dark brown; the coat and wai&s;tcoat lined throughout with ermine, which ju&s;t appeared at the edges; and a &s;mall gold hilted &s;word. As he was extremely &s;u&s;ceptible of cold, he wore flannel under the linings of all his
<PB N="221" REF="231">
clothes, and u&s;ually three pair of &s;tockings. He was the fir&s;t man who ventured to walk the &s;treets of London with an umbrella over his head: After carrying one near thirty years, he &s;aw them come into general u&s;e.</P>
<P>The precarious &s;tate of his health when he arrived in England from Ru&s;&s;ia, made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to u&s;e the utmo&s;t caution; and his per&s;everance in following the ad|vice of the medical practitioners was re|markable. After Dr. Lieberkyn, phy&s;ician to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, had recommended milk as a proper diet to re&s;tore his &s;trength, he made it the chief part of his food for thirty years; and though it at fir&s;t di&s;|agreed with him, he per&s;i&s;ted in trying it un|der every preparation that it was capable of, till it agreed with his &s;tomach. He knew that exerci&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to him, and he loved it. He was not one of tho&s;e who had rather take a clo&s;e than a walk; and though he had commonly his carriage with him
<PB N="222" REF="232">
when he went abroad, he yet walked nearly as much as he rode, and with &s;uch a pace, that he u&s;ed to &s;ay he was always more in|commoded in the &s;treets by tho&s;e he pa&s;&s;ed, than by them who overtook him. By this rigid attention and care his health was e&s;tabli&s;hed, his lungs acquired &s;trength and ela&s;ticity; and it is probable he would have lived &s;everal years longer, if the di&s;order, which was the immediate cau&s;e of his death, had left him to the gradual decay of nature.</P>
<P>His mind was the mo&s;t active that it is po&s;&s;ible to conceive; always on the wing, and never appearing to be weary. To &s;it &s;till, and endeavour to give re&s;t to the thought, was a luxury to which he was a perfect &s;tranger: he dreaded nothing &s;o much as inactivity, and that modern di&s;or|der which the French, who feel it not &s;o much as our&s;elves, di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of <HI>ennui</HI>.</P>
<P>He ro&s;e in the &s;ummer at four or five,
<PB N="223" REF="233">
and in the winter at &s;even; and having al|ways bu&s;ine&s;s before him, he was every day employed till the time of retiring to re&s;t; and when in health, I am told, was com|monly a&s;leep within two minutes after his lying down in bed.</P>
<P>Writing was his favourite employment, or rather amu&s;ement; and when the num|ber of his literary works is con&s;idered, and that they were the produce only of tho&s;e hours, which he was able to &s;natch from public bu&s;ine&s;s, an idea may be formed of his application. He wrote a fine flowing hand to the la&s;t, when he plea&s;ed, without &s;pectacles. And he had always one or two of the clerks belonging to his office, or to &s;ome of the charitable in&s;titutions in which he was engaged, to live in his hou&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t him. When Doctor Gold&s;mith, to relieve him&s;elf from the labour of writing, engaged an amanuen&s;is, he found him&s;elf incapable of dictation; and after eying each
<PB N="224" REF="234">
other &s;ome time, unable to proceed, the Doctor put a guinea in his hand, and &s;ent him away: but it was not &s;o with Mr. Hanway; he could compo&s;e fa&s;ter than any per&s;on could write. His mode was to dictate for as many hours together as he could &s;pare, and afterwards correct the copy, which was again wrote out and cor|rected, perhaps &s;everal times.</P>
<P>To write a fine hand very fa&s;t is a qua|lification which many per&s;ons, not defective in abilities, do not attain; but to write very well, and with &s;trict orthography from the verbal dictation of another per&s;on, with|out he&s;itation, will be found difficult by every per&s;on who tries it. Yet all this Mr. Hanway required, and with it the utmo&s;t di&s;patch. This made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to choo&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, at an early age, whil&s;t the mind is flexible, and to have them live in his hou&s;e, and take pains to in|&s;truct them. He had a very happy method
<PB N="225" REF="235">
of conveying in&s;truction; but the clo&s;e ap|plication which he required at all hours, his impatience, and the natural turn of his temper, &s;eldom &s;atisfied, not infrequently petulant, and always expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;appro|bation in terms which had the appearance of ill nature, were the cau&s;e that but few of the youths he took under his care remained with him any length of time. If by attention, activity, and per&s;everance, and a judicious &s;elf-commendation, not too frequently a&s;|&s;umed, they could go on till they gained his confidence, he &s;eldom failed to make them alert, ready at figures and writing, and hone&s;t men. One of the two pamphlets on bread, which contains ninety octavo pages, 200 law &s;heets, I wrote from his dictation, in one forenoon, although there are &s;everal calculations in it of the proportionate pro|duce of grain, when ground, dre&s;&s;ed, and baked.</P>
<P>By leaving his work to tran&s;act his or|dinary
<PB N="226" REF="236">
bu&s;ine&s;s, and afterwards recurring to it with new ideas, all his literary labours are defective in the arrangement of the mat|ter, and appear to have too much of the mi&s;cellaneous in their compo&s;ition. The ori|ginal idea is &s;ometimes left for the pur&s;uit of one newly &s;tarted, and either taken up again, when the mind of the reader has almo&s;t lo&s;t it, or it is totally de&s;erted. Yet tho&s;e who are judges of literary compo&s;ition, &s;ay that his language is well calculated to have the effect he de&s;ired on the reader, and impre&s;s him with the idea that the author was a man of inflexible integrity, and wrote from the pure dictates of the heart. It is plain and unornamented, without the appearance of art, or the affectation of &s;ingularity. Its greate&s;t defect (&s;ay they) is a want of con|ci&s;ene&s;s; its greate&s;t beauty an unaffected and genuine &s;implicity. He &s;poke French and Portugue&s;e, and under&s;tood the Rus
<PB N="227" REF="237">
and modern Per&s;ic imperfectly: Latin he had been taught at &s;chool; but had not much occa&s;ion to cultivate it after he entered into life.</P>
<P>In his natural di&s;po&s;ition he was cheerful but &s;erene. He enjoyed his own joke, and applauded the wit of another; but never de&s;cended from a certain dignity which he thought indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. His ex|perience furni&s;hed him with &s;ome anecdote or adventure, &s;uitable to every turn the di&s;|cour&s;e could take; and he was always wil|ling to communicate it. If in the hour of conviviality the di&s;cour&s;e took a turn, not con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t rigid cha&s;tity, he was not forward to reprove or take offence; but any attack on religion, e&s;pecially in the company of young people, was &s;ure to meet his mo&s;t pointed di&s;approbation. In conver&s;ation he was ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and gave readily to every one the be&s;t an&s;wer which occurred: But not fond of much
<PB N="228" REF="238">
&s;peaking him&s;elf, he did not always bear with patience, though commonly with &s;i|lence, the forward and importunate; them with whom every man, and every thing is either the very be&s;t or the very wor&s;t po&s;|&s;ible; who exemplify, for the in&s;truction of their auditors, tho&s;e common ideas which it is not po&s;&s;ible could e&s;cape them; and think loudne&s;s, and the ge&s;ticulation of un|nece&s;&s;ary warmth, can &s;upply the place of argument and politene&s;s. If the mirth de|generated into boi&s;terous laughter, he took his leave: <Q>"My companions," he would &s;ay, &startq;were too merry to be happy, or to &endq;let me be happy, &s;o I left them."</Q> He &s;poke better in public than was to be ex|pected of one who wrote &s;o much, and pointed to his &s;ubject; though he was &s;ome|times &s;educed into an eulogium on the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of the <HI>merchant</HI>, a character for which he entertained great reverence.</P>
<P>Although he him&s;elf never drank wine
<PB N="229" REF="239">
undiluted with water, he partook willingly of the joys of the table, and that felicity of conver&s;ation, which a moderate application to the bottle excites among men of parts; but he knew how the love of company in|fatuates young people, and the danger to which it expo&s;es them. The writer of the&s;e &s;heets is indebted to him beyond the power of expre&s;&s;ion, particularly for his advice, which he had the method of admini&s;tering with|out giving di&s;gu&s;t; and he never received &s;o &s;erious a caution as when at a public meeting, at the de&s;ire of Sir Jo&s;eph An|drews, he &s;ung a &s;ong better than Mr. Han|way expected.</P>
<P>In his tran&s;actions with the world, he was always open, candid, and &s;incere: What|ever he &s;aid might be depended on with im|plicit confidence. He adhered to the &s;trict truth, even in the <HI>manner</HI> of his relation, and no brilliancy of thought could induce him to vary from the fact; but although &s;o
<PB N="230" REF="240">
frank in his own proceedings, he had &s;een too much of life to be ea&s;ily deceived by others; and he did not often place a confidence that was betrayed. He did not, however, think the world &s;o degenerate as is commonly imagined: "And if I did," he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>&startq;I would not let it appear; for nothing can tend &s;o effectually to make a man wicked, or to keep him &s;o, as a marked &s;u&s;picion. Confidence is the reward of truth and fidelity, and the&s;e &s;hould never &endq;be exerted in vain."</Q></P>
<P>In his department of commi&s;&s;ioner for victualling the navy, he was uncommonly a&s;&s;iduous and attentive, and kept the con|tractors, and per&s;ons who had dealings with the office, at a great di&s;tance. He would not even accept a hare or phea&s;ant, or the &s;mal|le&s;t pre&s;ent from any of them; and when any were &s;ent him he always returned them, not in a moro&s;e manner, as if he affected the exce&s;s of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, but with &s;ome
<PB N="231" REF="241">
mild an&s;wer, &s;uch as, <Q>&startq;Mr. Hanway re|turns many thanks to Mr. &mdash; for the pre&s;ent he intended him; but he has made it a rule not to accept any thing from any per&s;on engaged with the office. A rule, which, whil&s;t he acknowledges Mr. &mdash;'s good intentions, he hopes &endq;he will not expect him to break through."</Q></P>
<P>With all this goodne&s;s Mr. Hanway had a certain &s;ingularity of thought and manners, which was, perhaps, the con&s;equence of his living the greater part of his life in foreign countries, and never having been married. He was not by any means an inattentive ob|&s;erver of the little forms of politene&s;s; but as he had &s;tudied them in various realms, &s;electing tho&s;e which he approved, his po|litene&s;s differed from that of other people. His conver&s;ation had an air of originality in it, which was plea&s;ing, far different from that of &s;ome very polite circles, in which a whole evening may be pa&s;&s;ed in perpetual
<PB N="232" REF="242">
chat, without a &s;ingle idea being &s;tarted that has not had its round before.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, more originality of expre&s;&s;ion among the lower orders of men than in polite circles, where every &s;entence is weighed in the mind before utterance is given to it. In one of Mr. Hanway's walks, in the neighbourhood of Park-lane, he was met by a man much inebriated, who ap|proached him in &s;o irregular a direction, that it might have been concluded he had bu&s;i|ne&s;s on both &s;ides the way. Mr. Hanway &s;topped when he came up to him to give him his choice which he would take; but the man &s;tood as &s;till as his intoxication would permit him, without attempting to pa&s;s on either &s;ide. After viewing each other a moment, &s;ays Mr. H. <Q>&startq;My friend, you &endq;&s;eem as if you had drank rather too much:" to which the man replied, &startq;<HI>You &s;eem as if &endq;you had eat rather too little."</HI></Q></P>
<P>He never took any of his &s;ervants from
<PB N="233" REF="243">
the recommendation of his friends; but commonly adverti&s;ed for them, appointing their applications to be left at &s;ome tavern. One adverti&s;ement for a cook was an&s;wered by more than a hundred letters, and he di|rected his clerk to reque&s;t the attendance of about a fourth part of this number at dif|ferent hours of the next day, which he de|dicated to this bu&s;ine&s;s; but by an unlucky mi&s;take they were all appointed to come at the &s;ame hour; and at noon, on a hot day, in the mid&s;t of Summer, were &s;een upwards of twenty cooks parading the &s;quare, broil|ing in the &s;un, inquiring for Mr. A. B. and attended by &s;everal hundred &s;pectators.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. Hanway, at another time, had hired a coachman, and was telling him the duty he required, concluding, &startq;you will attend with the re&s;t of my family every evening &endq;at prayers."</Q>&mdash;<HI>"Prayers, Sir!"</HI> &s;ays the de&s;cendant of Jehu, <Q>&startq;Why, did you never &endq;&s;ay your prayers?"</Q> a&s;ked Mr. Hanway.
<PB N="234" REF="244">
<HI>"I have never lived in a praying family."</HI> <Q>&startq;But have you any objection to &s;ay your &endq;pray|ers?"</Q> <Q>&startq;No, Sir, I've no objection&mdash;I hope &endq;you'll con&s;ider it in my wages."</Q></P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of Mr. Hanway's ex|ertions in favour of chimney &s;weepers, he addre&s;&s;ed a little urchin, after he had &s;wept a chimney in his own hou&s;e; <Q>&startq;Suppo&s;e &endq;now I give you a &s;hilling."</Q> <Q>&startq;God Al|mighty &endq;ble&s;s your honour, and thank you!"</Q> <Q>&startq;And what if I give you a fine tie-wig to &endq;wear on May-day, which is ju&s;t at hand?"</Q> <Q>&startq;Ah, ble&s;s your honour! my ma&s;ter won't let me &endq;go out on May-day."</Q>&mdash;"No: why not?" <HI>"He &s;ays its low life."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hanway was mentioning this an&s;wer, I think, to Mr. George Keate, when that gentleman gave him a &s;imilar anecdote. He was riding in the country on hor&s;e-back, and came to a place where &s;ome gyp&s;ies were regaling them&s;elves under a hedge with tea, and ju&s;t as he pa&s;&s;ed, a &s;trapping girl, one of
<PB N="235" REF="245">
the fraternity, was emptying the tea leaves out of the pot on the ground, when her com|panion thus rebuked her; <Q>&startq;Lord, Sal! why don't you lay them on a leaf? &s;ome poor &endq;body might be glad of them."</Q></P>
<P>Among the ornaments of his with-draw|ing room, were &s;ome, which de&s;erve to be mentioned, becau&s;e they help to illu&s;trate his character. He had procured portraits of &s;ix of the mo&s;t celebrated beauties, one of which was of the actre&s;s <HI>Adrienne le Couvreur</HI>, who died in the arms of Voltaire. The&s;e portraits, being all of the &s;ame &s;ize, he employed an ingenious workman to at|tach together, by a ribbon curiou&s;ly carved and gilded, which extended &s;everal feet, &s;o as to admit of their hanging in an uniform manner. On the &s;mooth parts of this rib|bon, which were glazed, were written &s;ome lines in prai&s;e of beauty; and over all was a &s;tatue repre&s;enting humility. At the bot|tom hung a mirror, ju&s;t &s;ufficiently convex
<PB N="236" REF="246">
to reflect a lady who looked in it of the &s;ize of the portraits. Round the frame of the mirror was painted,
<Q><L>"Wert thou, my daughter, faire&s;t of the <HI>&s;even</HI>;</L>
<L>"Think on the progre&s;s of devouring Time,</L>
<L>"And pay thy tribute to Humility."</L></Q></P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room was a picture, repre&s;enting the tomb of Pierre Mignard, painter to the king of France; and underneath a drawing of a country church-yard, with a venerable old man &s;eemingly in di&s;cour&s;e with a young one. At a di&s;tance a young woman was &s;een pray|ing near a grave; and on the &s;ide of a tomb, on which the old man's hand was laid, the following lines were in&s;cribed:
<Q><L>BEHOLD, my &s;on, this namele&s;s monument,</L>

<P><PB N="238" REF="248">Mr. Hanway appeared to have in every action of his life, the idea of his end. He examined his own conduct with the &s;ame degree of &s;everity, which men too often adopt in their &s;crutiny into the conduct of others, and always con&s;idered that the time would come, and might not be far off, when he &s;hould reflect with &s;orrow on every bad action of his life. There are many very good men, who, knowing that death is in|evitable, endeavour to bani&s;h from their mind the awful thought; but Mr. Hanway &s;eemed to derive a melancholy plea&s;ure in indulging the idea. Of the effects of this I proceed to a remarkable in&s;tance: He cau&s;ed the following words to be in&s;cribed on a large plate of bra&s;s enamelled, &s;o contrived as to &s;lide on rollers, and form the back of a wardrobe, and lock in a &s;e|cret manner.

<P><PB N="240" REF="250">His religion was pure, rational, fervent, and &s;incere; equally di&s;tant from a cold in|animate languor, and the phanta&s;ies of &s;u|pernatural intelligence: It was his re&s;ource con&s;tantly in trouble, as was writing at the moment of imagination. He believed the truths revealed in the go&s;pel, with the mo&s;t unvaried confidence; but &s;hewed no au&s;te|rity to per&s;ons who &s;et the dictates of na|ture and experience in oppo&s;ition to them, if they appeared to doubt with a willingne&s;s to be convinced. He con&s;idered religion as the mo&s;t effectual re&s;traint on bad actions; and although he rejoiced at the light which has been thrown by Mr. Voltaire, and other modern writers, on the &s;uper&s;tition of former ages; he preferred even that, with its attendant cruelty and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, to a comfortle&s;s &s;ceptici&s;m, and &s;ometimes pro|ceeded &s;o far as to expre&s;s his fears that the generality might one day become too en|lightened to be happy. In his writings on
<PB N="241" REF="251">
the &s;ubject, he endeavours to inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity of attending at the public offices, particularly that of the Lord's Supper; but carefully avoids entering into controver&s;ies on matters not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. The only religious argument that he engaged in, was to convince the common people that they ought not to be deterred from partak|ing of the &s;acrament, by St. Paul's caution to the Corinthians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, KPIMA <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P><P>Nam edens et bibens indigne, <HI>judicium</HI> &s;ibi ip&s;i man|ducat et bibit, non dijudicans corpus Domini.</P></NOTE> and that the word u&s;ed by the apo&s;tle relative to the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who partook wantonly, could not be applied to <HI>them</HI> in the vulgar tran&s;lation, of "eating and drinking <HI>damnation</HI>;" but meant a temporary and expiable puni&s;h|ment; and the learned, I believe, agree that this con&s;truction of the text is the true one.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="252">He knew well how much the happine&s;s of mankind is dependant on hone&s;t indu&s;try, and received a plea&s;ure, but faintly de&s;cribed in words, when any of the objects of his charity cleanly apparelled, and with cheer|ful and contented countenances, came to pay their re&s;pects to him. He treated them as his acquaintances, entered into their con|cerns with a paternal affection, and let them know that on any real emergency they might apply with confidence to him. It was this, rather than the largene&s;s of his gifts, that endeared him &s;o much to the common people: He never walked out but was fol|lowed by the good wi&s;hes, &s;ilent or expre&s;|&s;ed, of &s;ome to whom he had offered relief. To meet the eye of him whom he had obliged, was to him the highe&s;t luxury; and no man enjoyed it oftener.</P>
<P>Of his charity, it is not ea&s;y to convey an adequate idea: It was of that prudent and con&s;iderate kind, which is of the mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantial
<PB N="243" REF="253">
benefit. It did not con&s;i&s;t merely in <HI>giving</HI>; and though his heart was ever open to the complaint of the unfortunate, it required &s;omething more than mere &s;up|plication to obtain his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He was particularly careful to di&s;countenance the fa&s;hionable genteel way of begging by let|ter, in which talents capable of procuring &s;up|port are held out as excu&s;es for di&s;tre&s;s. To him that had once deceived him by fictitious di&s;tre&s;s he was inexorable; but when real mi&s;ery, the effect of accident or inevitable misfortune, came in his way, he never failed to afford &s;ub&s;tantial relief, which he was al|ways enabled to do; for he had the di&s;tribu|tion every year of more than his own whole income amounted to. It is not the love of money, &s;o much as the love of ea&s;e, which keeps clo&s;e the coffers of the wealthy.</P>
<P>Several years ago Mr. Hanway commi&s;|&s;ioned the writer of the&s;e &s;heets to di&s;tri|bute a &s;um of money, as far as fifty pounds,
<PB N="244" REF="254">
among the really de&s;erving pri&s;oners at that time confined in the pri&s;ons of the metropo|lis. How did I figure to my&s;elf the plea|&s;ure I &s;hould experience in relieving the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the wretched, in &s;etting the hand of the indu&s;trious to work, and giving food and vigour, and even liberty to him who drooped under the gloom of de&s;pair! but I &s;oon found that there was not the di&s;tre&s;s in our pri&s;ons which I had conceived; and that where it really was, there was not the greate&s;t appearance of it. Great part of the money was brought back; and al|though the precaution of buying and di&s;tri|buting the nece&s;&s;aries of life, was taken, yet tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries were bartered for the means of intoxication, and I was invited to drink brandy, the produce of the money I had be&s;towed in coals and candles, in a pri|&s;on, whence all &s;pirits are &s;uppo&s;ed to be ba|ni&s;hed by the &s;tricte&s;t of our laws.</P>
<P>But a few unworthy objects never alien|ated
<PB N="245" REF="255">
Mr. Hanway's affection for the really de&s;erving. The&s;e he endeavoured to find out in their &s;olitary habitations, with a mo&s;t laborious per&s;everance; &s;tudied their wants, and contrived the method of giving the mo&s;t effectual relief. In one of his &s;earches among the man&s;ions of the poor, he found a man of the name of <HI>Bermingham</HI> in extreme di&s;tre&s;s; and which he &s;oon perceived to be the effect of his ingenuity and &s;implicity. He was an engraver, a painter on gla&s;s, a modeller, a carver, the inventor of pierc|ing fan &s;ticks, a turner in metals; and worked with &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;m of zeal, that he would have &s;tarved amid&s;t wealth, rather than leave his inventions to provide food. His goods, even his bed, were &s;eized for rent; but he cared not if they left him the materials of his la&s;t di&s;covery. His talents, and native &s;implicity, had recommended him to Frederick Prince of Wales, who ap|pointed him his engraver with an annual pen|&s;ion;
<PB N="246" REF="256">
but when this failed, with the death of his patron, he was reduced to the ex|treme of mi&s;ery. Mr. Hanway at fir&s;t en|deavoured to confine his ingenuity to one line, and make it tend to his pecuniary ad|vantage; but finding this impo&s;&s;ible, he ap|plied for, and procured a pen&s;ion of forty pounds a year, from his Maje&s;ty. On this the poor arti&s;t was per&s;uaded to retire from his labours into the country; but before he had enjoyed, or rather &s;uffered the lei&s;ure of retirement one year, he was found drowned in a water near his re&s;idence.</P>
<P>When once Mr. Hanway had engaged in a public charitable undertaking, he omitted nothing that could po&s;&s;ibly tend to its pro|motion; no department was beneath him; his eye pervaded the who$$ &s;y&s;tem, and, like that of Providence, never &s;topt whil&s;t any thing remained to be done to further his benevolent de&s;igns. He thought every thing great which concerned the cau&s;e of
<PB N="247" REF="257">
humanity. The love of his fellow creatures &s;hewed it&s;elf in every action of his life. Ble&s;&s;ed with an elegant &s;ufficiency, he &s;e|parated what was within his idea of enough, and looked upon the re&s;t as appropriated, as a re&s;erve to &s;atisfy demands whenever they &s;hould be properly made. Di&s;tre&s;s, not incurred by profligacy, was to his heart a claim of relation&s;hip; and he &s;eemed to e&s;teem him&s;elf, what he mo&s;t emphatically was, one of the chief in&s;truments of Pro|vidence, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the indigent, in&s;truct the ignorant, to reclaim the guilty, and keep the good from being di&s;contented with their &s;tation in life.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing can more clearly evince the e&s;teem which men entertained for his character, than the &s;orrow they expre&s;&s;ed at his death. A long train of friends followed his hear&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in paying the la&s;t mournful duties to the remains of a man they &s;o tenderly loved whil&s;t living. Dr.
<PB N="248" REF="258">
Gla&s;&s;e, one of his executors, read a part of the burial &s;ervice over the corp&s;e, as great a part as his grief would permit him; and Dr. Markham, with whom he had lived in friend&s;hip for a long &s;eries of years, in a very pathetic di&s;cour&s;e recalled to the minds of their mutual friends a&s;&s;embled on this &s;o|lemn occa&s;ion in the church of Hendon, the virtues of the benevolent man they had lo&s;t. Alas! &s;o uncertain is every thing human: In a few days the reverend gentleman's death in&s;pired his &s;urviving friends with &s;enti|ments &s;imilar to tho&s;e he felt at being de|prived of Mr. Hanway!</P>
<P>Such is the feeble attempt which I have made, to delineate the character of him whom I revered as a patron, and e&s;teemed as the friend and advi&s;er of my early youth. The property he left at his death, which did not amount to two thou&s;and pounds, as he had no relation who wanted it, he bequeathed, except a few legacies as tokens of remem|brance,
<PB N="249" REF="259">
to &s;undry orphans and poor per&s;ons, whom he had befriended in his life time; among the&s;e is <HI>Mercy Draper</HI>, who&s;e mu&s;i|cal powers had oft excited his tendere&s;t thoughts whil&s;t &s;he was at the Foundling, and who&s;e pre&s;ent unfortunate &s;tate of mind awakened his warme&s;t friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The following ver&s;es were &s;ent me by a lady, who had frequent opportunities of &s;ee|ing in&s;tances of Mr. Hanway's benevolence, and who&s;e own heart taught her how to value his.</P>
