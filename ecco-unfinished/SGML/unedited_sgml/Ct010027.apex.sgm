<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HISTORY informs us, that it was cu&s;tomary in <HI>Athens,</HI> when any Citizen had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by &s;ome eminent Act of Heroi&s;m, to &s;end him into Exile; lea&s;t the A&s;cendant, which an exalted Character gives over the Minds of the People, &s;hould prove a Temptation to aim at Tyranny. Something &s;imilar to this Practice &s;eems at all Times to have
<PB N="4" REF="3">
obtained in the Republic of Arts and Sciences. Numberle&s;s are the In&s;tances of mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous Names, in every Branch of Knowledge, who have &s;uffered by a literary <HI>O&s;traci&s;m.</HI> The Literati entertain a Jealou&s;y of their Li|berties, even to a Degree of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and can but ill brook, that any Member of their Community &s;hould rai&s;e him&s;elf to a Supe|riority over his Cotemporaries, and de&s;troy that Equality, which has been always held to be the E&s;&s;ence of a Common-wealth. In this View, I think it my Duty to attack you with all the Scurrility and Abu&s;e, which your great Merit and Popularity, with the Danger ari&s;ing from both, make indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Shall Mr. <HI>G&mdash;k</HI> engro&s;s the Attention of the whole Town? Shall he be the Favourite of all, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Elegance of their Ta&s;te? Shall his Name become prover|bial, and be made u&s;e of to denote Excellence in any Art or Profe&s;&s;ion? I &s;ay, &s;hall this be evident to my Fellow-Citizens of <HI>Grub-Street,</HI> and a fatal Supinene&s;s &s;till hold them in Su&s;|pence?&mdash;Be it &s;o.&mdash;Behold me then draw my Pen, determined like <HI>Damien,</HI> to &s;tab this little Tyrant.</P>
<P>That you may not, Sir, imagine, that I am actuated by Rancour, I will not with|hold that Ju&s;tice to your Abilities, which the concurring Voice of the World extorts from me. I will admit, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage
<PB N="5" REF="4">
never received &s;uch an Actor. I will acknow|ledge, that the Entertainment of the Theatre has reached the utmo&s;t Extent of Perfection, under your Direction. I will not deny, that many Parts, even of the divine <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> were no more than a dead Letter, until your animating Genius enlivened their Beauties, and enforced their Energy. On this Account, I have no Objection, that you &s;hould be an Object of Admiration; but on what Foun|dation can you lay claim to our E&s;teem? He mu&s;t &s;urely be but little acquainted with that &s;mall Part of human Nature, which he may experience within his own Brea&s;t, who is ignorant, that the Man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;upe|rior Talents, is the common Di&s;turber of the Peace and Tranquility of Mankind. What Right have you to hurt my Pride and Self|love, by &s;tanding in &s;o eminent a Point of Light? Why &s;hould you be care&s;&s;ed by the No|bility, while I, who con&s;ider my&s;elf infinite|ly better entitled to their Notice, never receive a Card from a Right Honourable; nay, &s;hould &s;uch a Summons be wafted to my airy Man|&s;ion, my Incapacity to fee his Lord&s;hip's Servants, would re&s;train me from accepting the alluring Invitation. Is it not the height of Inhumanity, that you &s;hould live in the mo&s;t refined Elegance, indulging at Ea&s;e your Genius, and diver&s;ifying your &s;everal Employ|ments, according to the various Sugge&s;tions
<PB N="6" REF="5">
of Fancy, while I, who&s;e Faculties are an Honour to the Species, am compelled to take up my Re&s;idence almo&s;t in the etherial Man|&s;ions, where, in a Flock-bed, <HI>with Tape-tied Curtains, never meant to draw,</HI> I &s;ollicit the Favours of the Nine, who in vain &s;hed their Influence, while Imagination is warped by that benumbing Anxiety, expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Juve|nal&mdash;de Lodice parand&acirc;.</HI> The&s;e Circum&s;tances of Barbarity I can never forgive, and am re|&s;olved, for my own Ea&s;e, and that of my Fellow-&s;ufferers, to detract from your Repu|tation, and expo&s;e you, in the mo&s;t glaring Colours, to the World.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to your Treatment of Authors. How hard is the Fate of one of us Men of Genius, who, after tacking toge|ther five Acts of a Tragedy or Comedy, (no matter which) and enjoying the va&s;t Idea of five hundred Pounds, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame, have the Mortification to be informed by Mr. <HI>G&mdash;k, that, he is at all Times ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t $Word$ Labours of Genius, but really the Piece is $Word$ unfit for the Stage.</HI> Upon a Repul&s;e of this Kind, which, to my certain Know|ledge, happens &s;everal Times in a Sea&s;on, &s;hould not we Authors be in&s;tantly alarmed, and make it a common Cau&s;e, not knowing how &s;oon it may be the Ca&s;e of each of us in his Turn. This arbitrary Power, lodged
<PB N="7" REF="6">
in the Manager, of refu&s;ing what is ab&s;olute|ly unfit for the Stage, is &s;uch an Encroach|ment upon the Liberties of a free People, that, it is to be hoped, the Legi&s;lature under the pre&s;ent happy Settlement of the Mini|&s;try, will take the un&s;peakable Hard&s;hips we lie under into Con&s;ideration, and afford us that Redre&s;s, which the Severity of the Op|pre&s;&s;ion we endure will excite their Huma|nity to promote, with all convenient Speed. How this may be mo&s;t properly effected, whether by ve&s;ting &s;ome Per&s;on of Con&s;e|quence, (&s;uppo&s;e the Lord-Mayor, for the Time being) with an Authority of impo&s;ing whatever Dramatic Pieces, he &s;hall approve, upon the Managers, or by any other Method, which the Wi&s;dom of that great Body &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t, I will not pre&s;ume to determine, but content my&s;elf with having done my Duty, in hinting the Importance of &s;uch a Regula|tion.</P>
<P>It would carry me too far &s;hould I enume|rate the various Kinds of Ill-u&s;age, &s;everal with whom I have the mo&s;t intimate Connexion, have received from you, in Tran&s;actions of the Nature abovementioned. And indeed it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into a circum|&s;tantial Detail, as the ingenious Memoirs of <HI>Roderic Random,</HI> and <HI>Peregrine Pickle</HI> are to be found upon every Stall. The elaborate Author of tho&s;e original Productions, with a
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Re&s;entment, keen as the northern Bla&s;t, has laid you open in &s;o ma&s;terly a Manner, that any future Attack would have been unnece&s;&s;a|ry, had not his evil Genius influenced him to publi&s;h the Tragedy, who&s;e cruel Fate mu&s;t draw Tears from every tender Reader, in the pathetic Relation of its Parent. Unhappily from that Moment, the World took your Part, and one of the mo&s;t compleat Collections of Invective, Billing&s;gate, impotent Malice, Mi&s;|repre&s;entation and fal&s;e Ta&s;te, that this Age, &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by its exten&s;ive Improvement in every Species of Scurrility has produced, &s;unk into total Contempt and Ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;o formidable an Attack upon your Reputation, as an Actor, Manager, and Man, you had the Meanne&s;s to take under your Patronage this Winter a Farce, written by the &s;ame Gentleman. I call this Conduct Meanne&s;s, becau&s;e I will not &s;uppo&s;e, that you, who&s;e peculiar Province it is to imitate the Manners of the Times, will pretend, that it is in the lea&s;t natural, that you &s;hould be influenced in this proceeding, by the long exploded Principle of Chri&s;tian Forgivene&s;s. At lea&s;t I am re&s;olved to pay no Regard to this hypocritic Pretence, as I do not find the Operation of &s;uch a Motive within my own Brea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
I &s;hall under this Head only mention farther your Behaviour, in Regard to the Tragedy of <HI>Douglas.</HI> Does not the Name terrify you? Do you not turn pale? Are not your Slumbers di&s;turbed with horrible Imagi|nings?&mdash;What! reject the utmo&s;t Effort of human Genius, as improper for Repre&s;enta|tion!&mdash;True, indeed (for I will take no un|fair Advantage) it has been &s;aid, and I am informed the Author him&s;elf confirms it, that the Compo&s;ition is e&s;&s;entially different from what it was when put into your Hands; the Situations being varied, the Characters di|ver&s;ified, and the la&s;t Act entirely new writ. Is it probable, had this been true, that the ingenious Name&s;ake of the Author, would have traduced you in &s;o virulent a Manner, in &s;ome <HI>private</HI> Letters, which have been in|du&s;triou&s;ly made <HI>public?</HI> Certain it is, (tho' this Acknowledgment, which is extorted from me, will in no Sen&s;e extenuate the Charge of want of Ta&s;te and Judgment, fixed upon you) that the Tragedy of <HI>Douglas</HI> has not as yet entirely exploded the <HI>Che&s;s d'oeuvres</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Otway.</HI> The Barbari&s;ms of the fir&s;t are &s;till borne, in Con&s;ideration of the inexpre&s;&s;ible Beauties, by which he atones for them, and the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the latter does not entirely obviate the Effect of the pa|thetic, of which no Author, on this Side of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> was ever &s;o great a Ma&s;ter. Some
<PB N="10" REF="9">
who are inclined to be waggi&s;h, ob&s;erve it is a little unlucky, that this &s;ceptical Writer &s;hould be mi&s;taken in the only Point that he &s;eems to pronounce upon with Certainty. And others of a more &s;erious turn, tremble for the Con&s;equences, and dread, that &s;everal Converts to Infidelity, of this Gentleman's making, may be &s;haken in their Principles, and become inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that the Go&s;|pel may po&s;&s;ibly contain &s;ome Truth, in &s;pite of the very penetrating E&s;&s;ay upon Miracles, and the no le&s;s learned Hi&s;tory of Natural Religion.</P>
<P>I come now to your ungenerous, not to &s;ay infamous Artifices in depre&s;&s;ing Men of Abili|ties in your Art. When I mention the Name of <HI>C&mdash;r,</HI> if your Con&s;cience is not render'd callous to the Arrows of Remor&s;e, you can|not e&s;cape feeling the mo&s;t lively Compunc|tion. This Gentleman, who&s;e Advantages for the Stage tran&s;cend the Preten&s;ions of any theatric Hero of the pre&s;ent Age, as we are informed by a Writer, who &s;eems perfectly well acquainted with them, has been with mo&s;t unparellelled Circum&s;tances of Barba|rity cut off from his Profe&s;&s;ion, for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he can perform about &s;ixty Characters better than you, (a Number, if you had the lea&s;t Tincture of Genero&s;ity in your Di&s;po&s;ition, you might well &s;pare him, from the unlimited Stock of your Performan|ces)
<PB N="11" REF="10">
upon which la&s;t <HI>Winter</HI> he very honour|ably re&s;ted his Reputation as a Player, and challenged you in proper Form, to enter the Li&s;ts with him. You &s;candalou&s;ly refu&s;ed to take up the Gauntlet, and by that Piece of Pu&s;illanimity betrayed a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of an evident Inequality in the Conte&s;t. This inju|red Man has &s;urely Cau&s;e to triumph, but di&s;|daining an arrogant Exultation, which is in|compatible with a great Soul, is &s;till ready to come to the Te&s;t; and I am authori&s;ed to &s;ay it, will at any Time play the whole Number, or any Part of tho&s;e Characters with you for your NOSE.</P>
<P>To the elaborate Re&s;earches of this indefa|tigable Enquirer, we are obliged for a very &s;ingular Di&s;covery, namely, that your Father was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> which Anecdote will, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, tend to elucidate the Motives of your Conduct la&s;t <HI>Winter,</HI> in introducing an Army of <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> under the Di&s;gui&s;e of Dancers into this Kingdom. What might have been the Event of &s;o deep-laid a De&s;ign, if the good People of <HI>England</HI> had not imme|diately taken the Alarm, every &s;incere Friend to our happy E&s;tabli&s;hment in Church and State mu&s;t &s;hudder to think on. How ea&s;y would it have been to have encrea&s;ed their Numbers, until a &s;ufficient Body was let in among us to make an In&s;urrection, and &s;eize the Tower. That this mu&s;t have been your
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Intention in &s;uch an unnatural Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> I will not take upon me ab&s;olutely to a&s;&s;ert; but certain I am, that Appearances give Cau&s;e to the mo&s;t alarming Su&s;picions, and the acknowledged Probity of Mr. <HI>C&mdash;r,</HI> who has publi&s;hed the Foundation of your Attachment to our Enemies, puts it beyond doubt, that the&s;e Conjectures are not chime|rical. Lord <HI>Burleigh</HI> has laid it down as a Maxim, <HI>that</HI> England <HI>can never be undone but by a Parliament,</HI> and I beg leave to &s;ubjoin to this &s;age A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that</HI> England <HI>can never be &s;o ea&s;ily conquered, as by an Army of Figure-Dancers.</HI></P>
<P>The Importance of this Con&s;ideration has led me into a kind of political Digre&s;&s;ion. I now return to the Subject from which I devi|ated, and to the Wrongs of <HI>C&mdash;r,</HI> am pre|pared to add tho&s;e of <HI>M&mdash;n.</HI> This unhap|py Victim of tyrannic Power, who&s;e Genius and Fate render him in &s;ome re&s;pect &s;imilar to the great Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> both having been expelled the Society, of which they were the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Ornaments, and &s;pent the Period of their Exile in ab&s;tru&s;e and &s;peculative Re&s;earches&mdash;I &s;ay, this Object of your de&s;potic Re&s;entment, is &s;ingularly ill|treated, as he can be no way con&s;idered by you, as a Rival in your Profe&s;&s;ion, tho' &s;ome weak People, unacquainted with the true State of the Affair, incon&s;iderately imagine other|wi&s;e.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
No, Sir, you could readily allow him that Share of Applau&s;e, which his Merit in the peculiar Sphere of acting he was proper for, entitled him to, as your Cla&s;&s;es of playing were totally different; but &s;o unrea&s;onable is your Jealou&s;y, that you never could forgive him the great Reputation he had acquired in Logic and Metaphy&s;ics. <HI>Hinc illae Lachrymae.</HI></P>
<P>I am not unaware, Sir, that &s;ome Hireling Scribbler will probably undertake to defeat this Accu&s;ation, by advancing, that you are not incapable of Friend&s;hip, and have, in &s;ome remarkable In&s;tances, &s;hewn the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted Attachment. I &s;hall be perhaps told, that you received with open Arms a Gen|tleman, who fled from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Hibernian</HI> Manager; that you cheri&s;hed his ri&s;ing Genius, and that under your Au&s;pices, Mr. <HI>M&mdash;p</HI> has ri&s;en into Fame and univer&s;al E&s;teem. The Fact is undeniable, and I mu&s;t admit, that the Motive in Appearance is &s;peci|ous; but on that Account the more dangerous. Could we look into your Heart, we &s;hould there read that you entered into a Connexion with this Gentleman, the more effectually to ruin him. Can we &s;uppo&s;e, you did not fore&s;ee, that &s;eemingly e&s;pou&s;ing his Intere&s;t would inevitably excite the Envy of the un|de&s;erving Part of his Profe&s;&s;ion, and expo&s;e him to that Virulence of Malice, which be|came
<PB N="14" REF="13">
due to him, from the In&s;tant you de|clared his Cau&s;e your own.</P>
<P>It will be farther, I perceive, in&s;i&s;ted on, for I know all your little Subterfuges, that your Enmity to the unhappy Per&s;on, who&s;e Ca&s;e I have ju&s;t laid open, with the mo&s;t &s;ympathetic Feeling of his Misfortunes, did not influence you to the Prejudice of his de|&s;erving Daughter. I &s;hall be told with an Air of Triumph, that you embraced the fir&s;t Opportunity of fo&s;tering her youthful Merit, and that to you the Public is indebted for the rapid Improvement in various Talents, which recommend in a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Manner this young Lady. Such a Piece of Machiave|lian Politics may impo&s;e upon the un&s;u&s;|pecting, but permit me to a&s;k you, good Sir, did not you adopt the Daughter, that the World might compare your Genero&s;ity in that Action, to the Ill-u&s;age you pretend to have received from the Father? Is not this loading the unfortunate; and di&s;playing your own Character to the World, in the mo&s;t advan|tageous Point of View?<HI>&mdash;Such popular Hu|manity is Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>It is now proper that I &s;hould lay open to the Public in the cleare&s;t Light the con|temptible Methods, which you have at va|rious Times put in Practice to puff your own Abilities, and traduce your Rivals. Shameful Littlene&s;s of Mind! Not content with the
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Eulogiums of the mo&s;t eminent Geniu&s;es, who have taken frequent Occa&s;ions to pay that Tribute to your Talents, which an inge|nuous Mind finds Satisfaction in be&s;towing, you employ Hackney-Scribblers to write <HI>Tuners, Rhap&s;odi&s;ts, Examiners, Analy&s;i&s;es, &amp;c.</HI> again&s;t you, in order to make the World believe, that the utmo&s;t Efforts of Malevo|lence can fix nothing upon you to your Di&s;|advantage. Nay, is it not notorious, that you have paid them mo&s;t liberally, to prefer a Gentleman of the other Theatre to you, in your mo&s;t capital Performances, the more effectually to degrade him in the public Opi|nion, by the glaring Contra&s;t, obvious to every Ob&s;erver, upon &s;uch a Compari&s;on. And yet this Man thus cruelly attacked, has never done you any Harm, and &s;uch is the Gentlene&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition, I will take upon me to promi&s;e, that he never will.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will deny the Truth of this Accu&s;ation, and prote&s;t with your cu&s;toma|ry Hypocricy, that you never were guilty of engaging any Mortal breathing, in &s;o vile an Undertaking; but this profound, as you think it, Di&s;&s;imulation, will not impo&s;e upon the di&s;cerning; the latent Spring of Action is ea&s;ily di&s;covered through your Cobweb Poli|tics, without the Penetration of a <HI>Tacitus.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to remind you upon this Occa&s;ion, of the un&s;peakable Injury you have
<PB N="16" REF="15">
done to &s;everal young Gentlemen, who &s;e|duced by Mr. <HI>G&mdash;k</HI>'s great Succe&s;s, have embarked their All on the Theatric Ocean. How many Youths would have made very agreeable Mercers, whom we de&s;pi&s;e in the Per&s;onages of Princes?&mdash;Let me add, how many de&s;erving Attornies Clerks might have in Time ri&s;en to the Rank of Newgate-Solli|citors, who, when they pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us as Sovereigns, do not entirely fill up our Ideas of Royalty? For in the&s;e In&s;tances, different from all others relating to the Stage, we do not judge from real Life. Need I mention what the whole Town is apprized of, your &s;piriting-away Mr. <HI>F&mdash;te?</HI> Could any Action what&s;oever be more oppo&s;ite to the common Feelings of Humanity, than to &s;end that Gentleman to a &s;trange Country, without any other Friends, than Prince <HI>Pota|wowski,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cadwallader,</HI> who I am informed, have it no more in their Power to &s;erve him in <HI>Ireland,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Hardne&s;s of their Names, than the lineal De&s;cendants of the ancient Kings of that Kingdom. But your infernal Jealou&s;y mu&s;t be gratified at all Events.</P>
<P>And now Sir, having di&s;charged my Duty, by traducing you, according to the Dictates of my Con&s;cience, that I may not deviate from modern Forms, I &s;hall conclude with reque&s;ting a Favour. You mu&s;t know Mr.
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>G&mdash;k,</HI> that I have had by me, for &s;ome Years, a Dramatic Piece of two Acts, which I &s;hould be extremely glad if you would exhibit at your Hou&s;e. It is a Compo&s;ition of infinite Wit and Humour, and if you con|&s;ent to produce it, will in &s;ome Mea&s;ure re|trieve your Reputation among the choice Spirits of the Age. As I am not upon Terms of per&s;onal Intercour&s;e with you, I take this Method of communicating the fir&s;t Scene, by which Specimen you will be able to judge of the whole Performance. You will not without &s;trong Emotions of Envy, ob&s;erve all through a &s;trict Adherence to Nature, a &s;overeign Contempt of farcical Conceits, and Strokes of Comedy beyond the Reach of that Pencil, which &s;ketched the Characters of Lord <HI>Chalk&s;tone</HI> and <HI>Fribble.</HI></P>

<P>P&s;haw! what &s;ignifies his par|ticular Ill-u&s;age of you? It will be all k&mdash;&s;s my A&mdash;&s;e to enter into that&mdash;No&mdash;let us attack him as an Actor, and &s;hew the World that he impo&s;es upon them, by &s;tarting and fidgeting, and bouncing, and Thigh|&s;lapping, and Brea&s;t-knocking, and Shoulder|jirking. Leave it to me, and I will make it as plain as St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Steeple, that he may as well wipe his A&mdash;&s;e with a Brick-Bat, as attempt any Character in Tragedy.</P>

<P>But my dear Sir, my Ca&s;e mu&s;t not be neglected, by G&mdash;d&mdash;he's a d&mdash;d Ra&s;cal, and the World &s;hall know it.&mdash;No Morals by G&mdash;d,&mdash;and a Man without Morals I never could endure&mdash;hip&mdash;hem.</P>

<SPEAKER>Shylock.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by Morals? Morals, or Ethics, as they are called&mdash;I never under&s;tood. <HI>R$chfoucault</HI> has demon|&s;trated Self-love to be the &s;ole Principle in human Actions&mdash;and&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;, but let us proceed to Bu&s;ine&s;s. I find you approve of my Propo&s;al, and think the mo&s;t eligible

way of taking this Tyrant off, is by a Pam|phlet. I would propo&s;e, that we may not only point the Dagger at <HI>his</HI> Heart, but plant it in the Brea&s;ts of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who are mo&s;t clo&s;ely connected with him.&mdash;</P>

<P>This Scheme of Revenge, Mr. <HI>Shylock,</HI> is very plea&s;ing;&mdash;but will it not be imprudent in you, to appear too openly in the Enterprize, lea&s;t it &s;hould draw down the U&s;urper's Vengeance on your innocent Daughter?</P>

<P>He never played any Character,&mdash;for to play a Character&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I &s;ay to play a Character,&mdash;you mu&s;t under&s;tand playing as a Science. The <HI>Abb&eacute; du Bo&s;s</HI> is the only Man, who has treated as it were &s;cientifically of our Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
