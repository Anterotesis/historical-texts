<HEAD>AN
ACCOUNT
OF THE
LIFE and WRITINGS
OF
Mr. JAMES THOMSON.</HEAD>
<P>IT is commonly &s;aid, that the life of a good writer
is be&s;t read in his works; which can &s;carce fail to
receive a peculiar tincture from his temper, manners,
and habits: the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of his mind,
his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t, will there appear undi&s;gui|&s;ed.
But however just this ob&s;ervation may be; and
although we might &s;afely re&s;t Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s fame, as
a good man, as well as a man of genius, on this &s;ole
footing; yet the de&s;ire which the public always &s;hews
of being more particularly acquainted with the hi&s;tory
of an eminent author, ought not to be di&s;appointed;
as it proceeds not from mere curio&s;ity, but chiefly
from affection and gratitude to tho&s;e by whom they
have been entertained and in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>To give &s;ome account of a decea&s;ed friend is often
a piece of ju&s;tice likewi&s;e, which ought not to be re|fu&s;ed
to his memory: to prevent or efface the imper|tinent
fictions which officious biographers are &s;o apt to
collect and propagate. And we may add, that the
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
circum&s;tances of an author's life will &s;ometimes throw
the be&s;t light upon his writings; in&s;tances whereof we
shall meet with in the following pages.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was born at <HI>Ednam,</HI> in the &s;hire of
<HI>Roxburgh,</HI> on the 11th of <HI>September,</HI> in the year 1700.
His father, mini&s;ter of that place, was but little known
beyond the narrow circle of his co-pre&s;byters, and to
a few gentlemen in the neighbourhood; but highly re|&s;pected
by them for his piety, and his diligence in the
pa&s;toral duty; as appeared afterwards in their kind of|fices
to his widow and orphan family.</P>
<P>The Reverend Me&s;&s;. <HI>Riccarton</HI> and <HI>Gu&s;thart</HI> par|ticularly,
took a mo&s;t affectionate and friendly part
in all their concerns. The former, a man of uncom|mon
penetration and good ta&s;te, had very early di&s;co|vered,
through the rudene&s;s of young <HI>Thomson</HI>'s pue|rile
e&s;&s;ays, a fund of genius well de&s;erving culture
and encouragement. He undertook therefore, with
the father's aprobation, the chief direction of his &s;tu|dies,
furni&s;hed him with the proper books, corrected
his performances, and was daily rewarded with the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his labour &s;o happily employed.</P>
<P>The other reverend gentleman, Mr. <HI>Gu&s;thart,</HI> who
is &s;till living, one of the mini&s;ters of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
&s;enior of the Chapel Royal, was no le&s;s &s;erviceable to
Mrs. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> in the mangement of her little affairs;
which, after the decea&s;e of her hu&s;band, burdened as
&s;he was with a family of nine children, required the
prudent coun&s;els and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that faithful and ge|nerous
friend.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Bennet</HI> likewi&s;e, well known for his gay
humour and ready poetical wit, was highly delighted
with our young poet, and u&s;ed to invite him to pa&s;s the
&s;ummer-vacation at his country-&s;eat; a &s;cene of life
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
which Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> always remembered with particu|lar
plea&s;ure. But what he wrote during that time, ei|ther
to entertain Sir <HI>William</HI> and Mr. <HI>Riccarton,</HI> or for
his own amu&s;ement, he de&s;troyed every new-year's
day; committing his little pieces to the flames in their
due order; and crowning the &s;olemnity with a copy
of ver&s;es, in which were humourou&s;ly recited the &s;e|veral
grounds of their condemnation.</P>
<P>After the u&s;ual cour&s;e of &s;chool education, under an
able ma&s;ter at <HI>Jedburgh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was &s;ent to the
univer&s;ity of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> But in the &s;econd year of
his admi&s;&s;ion, his &s;tudies were for &s;ome time interrupted
by the death of his father; who was carried of &s;o &s;ud|denly,
that it was not po&s;&s;ible for Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> with
all the diligence he could u&s;e, to receive his la&s;t ble&s;|&s;ing.
This affected him to an uncommon degree; and
his relations &s;till remember &s;ome extraordinary in&s;tan|ces
of his grief and filial duty on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> who&s;e maiden name was <HI>Hume,</HI> and
who was co-heire&s;s of a &s;mall e&s;tate in the country, did
not &s;ink under this misfortune. She con&s;ulted her
friend Mr. <HI>Gu&s;thart;</HI> and having, by his advice, mort|gaged
her moiety of the farm, repaired with her family
to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> where &s;he lived in a decent frugal man|ner,
till her favourite &s;on had not only fini&s;hed his aca|demical
cour&s;e, but was even di&s;tingui&s;hed and patro|nized
as a man of genius. She was, her&s;elf, a per&s;on
of uncommon natural endowments; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every
&s;ocial and dome&s;tic virtue; with an imagination, for
vivacity and warmth, &s;carce inferior to her &s;on's, and
which rai&s;ed her devotional exerci&s;es to a pitch border|ing
on enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>But whatever advantage Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> might derive
from the complexion of his parent, it is certain he
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
owed much to a religious education: and that his early
acquaintance with the &s;acred writings contributed
greatly to that <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> by which his works will be for
ever di&s;tingui&s;hed. In his fir&s;t pieces the <HI>Sea&s;ons,</HI> we
&s;ee him at once a&s;&s;ume the maje&s;tic freedom of an
Ea&s;tern writer; &s;eizing the grand images as they ri&s;e,
clothing them in his own expre&s;&s;ive language, and pre|&s;erving,
throughout, the grace, the variety, and the
dignity which belong to a ju&s;t compo&s;ition; unhurt
by the &s;tiffne&s;s of formal method.</P>
<P>About this time, the &s;tudy of poetry was become
general in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> authors being
univer&s;ally read, and imitations of them attempted.
<HI>Addi&s;on</HI> had lately di&s;played the beauties of <HI>Milton</HI>'s
immortal work; and his remarks on it, together with
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s celebrated <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> had opened the way to an
acquaintance with the be&s;t poets and critics.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t learned critic is not always the be&s;t
judge of poetry; ta&s;te being a gift of nature, the
want of which, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> cannot &s;upply; nor
even a &s;tudy of the be&s;t originals, when the reader's
faculties are not <HI>tuned in a certain con&s;onance</HI> to tho&s;e
of the poet: and this happened to be the ca&s;e with
certain learned gentlemen, into who&s;e hands a few of
Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays had fallen. Some inaccura|cies
of &s;tyle, and tho&s;e luxuriances which a young wri|ter
can hardly avoid, lay open to their cavils and cen|&s;ure;
&s;o far indeed they might be competent judges:
but the fire and enthu&s;ia&s;m of the poet had entirely
e&s;caped their notice. Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> however, con&s;ci|ous
of his own &s;trength, was not di&s;couraged by this
treatment; e&s;pecially as he had &s;ome friends on who&s;e
judgment he could better rely, and who thought very
differently of his perfomances. Only, from that time,
<PB N="v" REF="7">
he began to turn his views towards <HI>London;</HI> where
works of genius may always expect a candid recep|tion
and due encouragement; and an accident &s;oon
after entirely determined him to try his fortune there.</P>
<P>The divinity-chair at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was then filled by
the reverend and learned Mr. <HI>Hamilton;</HI> a gentleman
univer&s;ally re&s;pected and beloved; and who had par|ticularly
endeared him&s;elf to the young divines under
his care, by his kind offices, his candour and affability.
Our author had attended his lectures for about a year,
when there was pre&s;cribed to him for the &s;ubject of
an exerci&s;e, a P&s;alm, in which the power and maje&s;ty
of God are celebrated. Of this p&s;alm he gave a pa|raphra&s;e
and illu&s;tration, as the nature of the exerci&s;e
required; but in a &s;tyle &s;o highly poetical as &s;urpri&s;ed
the whole audience. Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> as his cu&s;tom was,
complimented the orator upon his performance, and
pointed out to the &s;tudents the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;triking
parts of it; but at la&s;t, turning to Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> he
told him, &s;miling, that if he thought of being u&s;eful in
the mini&s;try, he mu&s;t keep a &s;tricter rein upon his ima|gination,
and expre&s;s him&s;elf in language more intelli|gible
to an ordinary congregation.</P>
<P>This gave Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> to under&s;tand, that his ex|pectations
from the &s;tudy of theology might be very
precarious; even though the church had been more
his free choice than probably it was. So that having,
&s;oon after, received &s;ome encouragement from a lady
of quality, a friend of his mother's, then in <HI>London,</HI> he
quickly prepared him&s;elf for his journey. And al|though
this encouragement ended in nothing benefi|cial,
it &s;erved for the pre&s;ent, as a good pretext to co|ver
the imprudence of committing him&s;elf to the wide
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
world, un$riended and unpatroni&s;ed, and with the
&s;lender &s;tock of money he was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>But his merit did not long lye concealed. Mr. <HI>For|bes,</HI>
afterwards Lord Pre&s;ident of the Se&s;&s;ion, then at|tending
the &s;ervice of parliament, having &s;een a &s;peci|men
of Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s poetry in <HI>Scotland,</HI> received him
very kindly, and recommended him to &s;ome of his
friends; particularly to Mr. <HI>Aikman,</HI> who lived in great
intimacy with many per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and
worth. This gentleman, from a connoi&s;&s;eur in paint|ing,
was become a profe&s;&s;ed painter; and his ta&s;te be|ing
no le&s;s ju&s;t and delicate in the kindred art of de&s;|criptive
poetry, than in his own, no wonder that he
&s;oon conceived a friend&s;hip for our author. What a
warm return he met with, and how Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was
affected by his friend's premature death, appears in the
copy of ver&s;es which he wrote on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, our author's reception, where|ever
he was introduced, emboldened him to ri&s;k the
publication of his <HI>Winter;</HI> in which, as him&s;elf was a
mere novice in &s;uch matters, he was kindly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> then private tutor to his Grace the Duke of
<HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> and his brother the Lord <HI>George Graham,</HI>
&s;o well known afterwards as an able and gallant &s;ea|officer.
To Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI> he likewi&s;e owed his fir&s;t ac|quaintance
with &s;everal of the wits of that time; an
exact information of their characters, per&s;onal and
poetical, and how they &s;tood affected to each other.</P>
<P>The poem of <HI>Winter,</HI> publi&s;hed in <HI>March</HI> 1726, was
no &s;ooner read than univer;sally admired: tho&s;e only
excepted who had not been u&s;ed to feel, or to look for
any thing in poetry, beyond a <HI>point</HI> of &s;atirical or epi|grammatic
wit, a &s;mart <HI>antithe&s;is</HI> richly trimmed with
rhyme, or the &s;oftne&s;s of an <HI>elegiac</HI> complaint. To
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
&s;uch his manly cla&s;&s;ical &s;pirit could not readily com|mend
it&s;elf; till, after a more attentive peru&s;al, they
had got the better of their prejudices, and either ac|quired
or affected a truer ta&s;te. A few others &s;tood
aloof, merely becau&s;e they had long before fixed the
articles of their poetical creed, and re&s;igned them&s;elves
to an ab&s;olute de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing any thing new and
original. The&s;e were &s;omewhat mortified to find their
notions di&s;turbed by the appearance of a poet, who
&s;eemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own ge|nius.
But, in a &s;hort time, the applau&s;e became una|nimous;
every one wondering how &s;o many pictures,
and pictures &s;o familiar, &s;hould have moved them but
faintly to what they felt in his de&s;criptions. His di|gre&s;&s;ions
too, the overflowings of a tender benevolent
heart, charmed the reader no le&s;s; leaving him in
doubt, whether he &s;hould more admire the <HI>Poet,</HI> or
love the <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>From that time Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s acquaintance was
courted by all men of ta&s;te; and &s;everal ladies of high
rank and di&s;tinction became his declared patrone&s;&s;es
the Counte&s;s of <HI>Hertford,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Drelincourt,</HI> afterwards
Vi&s;counte&s;s <HI>Primro&s;e,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Stanley,</HI> and others. But
the chief happine&s;s which his <HI>Winter</HI> procured him
was, that it brought him acquainted with Dr. <HI>Rundle,</HI>
afterwards Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Derry:</HI> who, upon conver|&s;ing
with Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> and finding in him qualities
greater &s;till, and of more value, than tho&s;e of a poet,
received him into his intimate confidence and friend|&s;hip;
promoted his character every where; introdu|ced
him to his great friend the Lord Chancellor <HI>Tal|bot;</HI>
and, &s;ome years after, when the elde&s;t &s;on of
that nobleman was to make his tour of travelling, re|commended
Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> as a proper companion for
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
him. His affection and gratitude to Dr. <HI>Rundle,</HI> and
his indignation at the treatment that worthy prelate
had met with, are finely expre&s;&s;ed in his poem to the
memory of Lord <HI>Talbot.</HI> The true cau&s;e of that un|de&s;erved
treatment has been &s;ecreted from the public,
as well as the dark <HI>manoeuvres</HI> that were employed:
but Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> who had acce&s;s to the be&s;t informa|tion,
places it to the account of
<Q><P>&mdash;Slanderous zeal, and politics infirm,
Jealous of worth.&mdash;</P></Q></P>
<P>Mean-while, our poet's chief care had been, in return
for the public favour, to fini&s;h the plan which their
wi&s;hes laid out for him; and the expectations which his
<HI>Winter</HI> had rai&s;ed, were fully &s;atisfied by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
publications of the other <HI>Sea&s;ons:</HI> of <HI>Summer,</HI> in the
year 1727; of <HI>Spring,</HI> in the beginning of the follow|ing
year; and of <HI>Autumn,</HI> in a quarto edition of his
works, printed in 1730.</P>
<P>In that edition, the <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> are placed in their natu|ral
order; and crowned with that inimitable <HI>Hymn,</HI>
in which we view them in their beautiful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as
<HI>one whole,</HI> the <HI>immediate</HI> effect of infinite <HI>Power</HI> and
<HI>Goodne&s;s.</HI> In imitation of the Hebrew bard, all nature
is called forth to do homage to the Creator, and the
reader is left enraptured in &s;ilent adoration and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, and his tragedy of <HI>Sophoni&s;ba,</HI> writ|ten,
and acted with applau&s;e, in the year 1729, Mr.
<HI>Thom&s;on</HI> had, in 1727, publi&s;hed his poem to the Me|mory
of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> then lately decea&s;ed; con|taining
a de&s;erved encomium of that incomparable
man, with an account of his chief di&s;coveries; &s;ublime|ly
poetical; and yet &s;o ju&s;t, that an ingenious foreigner,
the Count <HI>Algarotti,</HI> takes a line of it for the text of
his philo&s;ophical dialogues, <HI>Il Neutoniani&s;mo per le
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
dame:</HI> this was in part owing to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had
of his friend Mr. <HI>Grey,</HI> a gentleman well ver&s;ed in the
<HI>Newtonian philo&s;ophy,</HI> who, on that occa&s;ion, gave him
a very exact, though general, ab&s;tract of its principles.</P>
<P>That &s;ame year, the re&s;entment of our merchants,
for the interruption of their trade by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in
<HI>America,</HI> running very high, Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> zealou&s;ly
took part in it; and wrote his poem <HI>Britannia,</HI> to
rou&s;e the nation to revenge. And although this piece
is the le&s;s read that its &s;ubject was but accidental and
temporary; the &s;pirited generous &s;entiments that en|rich
it, can never be out of &s;ea&s;on; they will at lea&s;t
remain a monument of that love of his country, that
<HI>devotion to the public,</HI> which he is ever inculcating as
the perfection of virtue, and which none ever felt
more pure, or more inten&s;e, than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our author's poetical &s;tudies were now to be inter|rupted,
or rather improved, by his attendance on the
Honourable Mr. <HI>Charles Talbot</HI> in his travels. A de|lightful
ta&s;k indeed! endowed as that young nobleman
was by nature, and accompli&s;hed by the care and ex|ample
of the be&s;t of fathers, in whatever could adorn
humanity: graceful of per&s;on, elegant in manners and
addre&s;s, pious, humane, generous; with an exqui&s;ite
ta&s;te in all the finer arts.</P>
<P>With this amiable companion and friend. Mr. <HI>Thom|&s;on</HI>
vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the courts and capital cities of <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
and returned with his views greatly enlarged;
not of exterior nature only, and the works of art, but
of human life and manners, of the constitution and po|licy
of the &s;everal &s;tates, their connexions, and their
religious in&s;titutions. How particular and judicious
his ob&s;ervations were, we &s;ee in his poem of <HI>Liberty,</HI>
begun &s;oon after his return to <HI>England.</HI> We &s;ee, at
<PB N="x" REF="12">
the &s;ame time, to what a high pitch his love of his
country was rai&s;ed, by the compari&s;ons he had all along
been making of our happy well-poi&s;ed government
with tho&s;e of other nations. To in&s;pire his fellow-&s;ub|jects
with the like &s;entiments; and to &s;hew them by
what means the precious freedom we enjoy may be
pre&s;erved, and how it may be abu&s;ed or lo&s;t; he em|ployed
two years of his life in compo&s;ing that noble
work: upon which, con&s;cious of the importance and
dignity of the &s;ubject, he valued him&s;elf more than
upon all his other writings.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was writing the fir&s;t: part of <HI>Li|berty,</HI>
he received a &s;evere &s;hock, by the death of his
noble friend and fellow-traveller: which was &s;oon fol|lowed
by another that was &s;everer &s;till, and of more
general concern; the death of Lord <HI>Talbot</HI> him&s;elf;
which Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> &s;o pathetically and &s;o ju&s;tly laments
in the poem dedicated to his memory. In him, the na|tion
&s;aw it&s;elf deprived of an uncorrupted patriot, the
faithful guardian of their rights, on who&s;e wi&s;dom and
integrity they had founded their hopes of relief from
many tedious vexations? and Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> be&s;ides his
&s;hare in the general mourning, had to bear all the af|fliction
which a heart like his could feel, for the per&s;on
whom, of all mankind, he mo&s;t revered and loved. At
the &s;ame time, he found him&s;elf from an ea&s;y compe|tency,
reduced to a &s;tate of precarious dependence, in
which he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his life; excepting
only the two la&s;t years of it, during which he enjoyed
the place of Surveyor-General of the <HI>Leeward I&s;lands,</HI>
procured for him by the generous friend&s;hip of my
Lord <HI>Lyttleton.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately upon his return to <HI>England</HI> with Mr.
<HI>Talbot,</HI> the Chancellor had made him his &s;ecretary of
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
<HI>Briefs;</HI> a place of little attendance, &s;uiting his retired
indolent way of life, and equal to all his wants. This
place fell with his patron; and although the noble
Lord who &s;ucceeded to Lord <HI>Talbot</HI> in office, kept it
vacant for &s;ome time, probably till Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> &s;hould
apply for it, he was &s;o di&s;pirited, and &s;o li&s;tle&s;s to
every concern of that kind, that he never took one
&s;tep in the affair: a neglect which his be&s;t friends
greatly blamed in him.</P>
<P>Yet could not his genius be depre&s;&s;ed, or his temper
hurt, by this rever&s;e of fortune. He re&s;umed, with
time, his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s, and never abated one ar|ticle
in his way of living; which, though &s;imple, was
genial and elegant. The profits ari&s;ing from his works
were not incon&s;iderable; his tragedy of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI>
acted in 1738, yielded a good &s;um; Mr. <HI>Millar</HI> was al|ways
at hand, to an&s;wer, or even to prevent, his de|mands;
and he had a &s;riend or two be&s;ides, who&s;e
hearts, he knew, were not contracted by the ample
fortunes they had acquired; who would, of them|&s;elves,
interpo&s;e, if they &s;aw any occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>But his chief dependence, during this long interval,
was on the protection and bounty of his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI>
FREDERIC Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> who, upon the recom|mendation
of Lord <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> then his chief favourite,
&s;ettled on him a hand&s;ome allowance. And after|wards,
when he was introduced to his Royal Highne&s;s,
that excellent prince, who truly was what Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>
paints him, <HI>the friend of mankind, and of merit,</HI> recei|ved
him very graciou&s;ly, and ever after honoured him
with many marks of particular favour and confidence.
A circum&s;tance, which does equal honour to the patron
and the poet, ought not hers to be omitted; that my
Lord <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s recommendation came altogether un|&s;$olicited,
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
and long before Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was per&s;onally
known to him.</P>
<P>It happened, however, that the favour of his Royal
Highne&s;s was in one in&s;tance of &s;ome prejudice to our
author; in the refu&s;al of a licence for his tragedy of
<HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Eleonora,</HI> which he had prepared for the
&s;tage in the year 1739. The reader may &s;ee that this
play contains not a line which could ju&s;tly give offence;
but the mini&s;try, &s;till &s;ore from certain pa&s;quinades,
which had lately produced the &s;tage act; and as little
&s;atisfied with, &s;ome parts of the Prince's political con|duct,
as he was with their management of the public
affairs; would not ri&s;k. the repre&s;entation of a piece
written under his eye, and, they might probably think,
by his command.</P>
<P>Thss refu&s;al drew after it another; and in a way
which, as it is related, was rather ludicrous. Mr. <HI>Pa|ter&s;on,</HI>
a companion of Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> afterwards his <HI>de|puty,</HI>
and then his <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;or</HI> in the general &s;urveyor&s;hip,
u&s;ed to write out fair copies for his friend, when &s;uch
were wanted for the pre&s;s or for the &s;tage. This
gentleman likewi&s;e courted the tragic mu&s;e; and had
taken for his &s;ubject, the &s;tory of <HI>Arminius</HI> the <HI>German</HI>
hero. But his play, guiltle&s;s as it was, being pre&s;ented
for a licence, no &s;ooner had the <HI>cen&s;or</HI> ca&s;t his eyes on
the hand-writing in which he had &s;een <HI>Edward</HI> and
<HI>Eleonora,</HI> than he cried out, Away with it! and the
author's profits were reduced to what his book&s;eller
could afford for a tragedy in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s next performance was his <HI>Ma&s;que</HI>
of <HI>Alfred;</HI> written, jointly with Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> by com|mand
of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> for the entertainment
of his Royal Highne&s;s's court, at his &s;ummer re&s;idence.
This piece, with &s;ome alterations, and the mu&s;ic new,
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
has been &s;ince brought upon the &s;tage by Mr. <HI>Mallet:</HI>
but the edition we give is from the <HI>original,</HI> as it was
acted at <HI>Clifden,</HI> in the year 1740, on the birth day of
her Royal Highne&s;s the Prince&s;s <HI>Augu&s;ta.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1745, his <HI>Tancred</HI> and <HI>Sigi&s;munda,</HI> taken
from the novel in <HI>Gil Blas,</HI> was performed with ap|plause;
and, from the deep romantic di&s;tre&s;s of the lo|vers,
continues to draw crouded hou&s;es. The &s;ucce&s;s
of this piece was indeed in&s;ured from the fir&s;t, by Mr.
<HI>Garrick</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> their appearing in the princi|pal
characters, which they heighten and adorn with all
the magic of their never-failing art.</P>
<P>He had, in the mean-time, been fini&s;hing his <HI>Ca&s;tle
of Indolence,</HI> in two <HI>cantos.</HI> It was, at fir&s;t, little more
than a few detached &s;tanzas, in the way of raillery on
him&s;elf, and on &s;ome of his &s;riends, who would re|proach
him with indolence; while he thought them, at
lea&s;t, as indolent as him&s;elf. But he &s;aw very &s;oon,
that the &s;ubject de&s;erved to be treated more &s;eriou&s;ly,
and in a form fitted to convey one of the mo&s;t impor|tant
moral le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;tanza</HI> which he u&s;es in this work is that of
<HI>Spen&s;er,</HI> borrowed from the <HI>Italian</HI> poets; in which he
thought rhymes had their proper place, and were even
graceful: the compa&s;s of the &s;tanza admitting an agree|able
variety of final &s;ounds; while the &s;en&s;e of the
poet is not cramped or cut &s;hort, nor yet too much di|lated;
as mu&s;t often happen, when it is parcelled out
into rhymed couplets; the u&s;ual mea&s;ure, indeed, of
our <HI>elegy</HI> and <HI>&s;atire;</HI> but which always weakens the
higher poetry, and, to a true ear, will &s;ometimes give
it an air of the <HI>burle&s;que.</HI></P>
<P>This was the la&s;t piece Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> him&s;elf publi&s;h|ed;
his tragedy of <HI>Cariolanus</HI> being only prepared for
<PB N="xiv" REF="16">
the theatre, when a fatal accident robbed the world of
one of the be&s;t men, and be&s;t poets, that lived in it.</P>
<P>He had always been a timorous hor&s;eman; and
more &s;o, in a road where numbers of giddy or un&s;kilful
riders are continually pa&s;&s;ing; &s;o that when the wea|ther
did not invite him to go by water, he would com|monly
walk the di&s;tance between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI>
with any acquaintance that offered; with whom he
might chat and re&s;t him&s;elf, or perhaps dine, by the
way. One &s;ummer-evening, being alone, in his walk
from town to <HI>Hammer-&s;mith,</HI> he had overheated him&s;elf,
and in that condition imprudently took a boat to carry
him to <HI>Kew;</HI> apprehending no bad con&s;equence from
the chill air on the river, which his walk to his hou&s;e,
at the Upper end of <HI>Kew-lane,</HI> had always hitherto
prevented. But, now, the cold had &s;o &s;eized him,
that next day he found him&s;elf in a high fever, &s;o
much the more to be dreaded that he was of a full
habit. This, however, by the u&s;e of proper medi|cines,
was removed, &s;o that he was thought to be out
of danger: till the fine weather having tempted him to
expo&s;e him&s;elf once more to the evening dews, his
fever returned with violence, and with &s;uch &s;ymptoms
as left no hopes of a cure. Two days had pa&s;&s;ed be|fore
his relap&s;e was known in town; at la&s;t Mr. <HI>Mitchell</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Reid,</HI> with Dr. <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> being informed of
it, po&s;ted out at midnight to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but, alas!
came only to endure a &s;ight of all others the mo&s;t
&s;hocking to nature, the la&s;t agonies of their beloved
friend. This lamented death happened on the 27th day
of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1748.</P>
<P>His te&s;tamentary executors were, the Lord <HI>Lyttle|ton,</HI>
who&s;e care of our poet's fortune and &s;ame cea&s;ed
not with his life; and Mr. <HI>Mitchell,</HI> a gentleman equally
<PB N="xv" REF="17">
noted for the truth and con&s;tancy of his private friend|ships,
and for his addre&s;s and &s;pirit as a public mi|ni&s;ter.
By their united intere&s;t, the Orphan play of
<HI>Coriolanus</HI> was brought on the &s;tage to the be&s;t advan|tage:
from the profits of which, and the &s;ale of ma|nu&s;cripts,
and other effects, all demands were duly
&s;atisfied, and a hand&s;ome &s;um remitted to his &s;i&s;ters.
My Lord <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s prologue to this piece was admi|red
as one of the be&s;t that had ever been <HI>written:</HI> the
be&s;t <HI>&s;poken</HI> it certainly was. The &s;ympathizing audi|ence
&s;aw that, <HI>then</HI> indeed, Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> was no <HI>actor;</HI>
that the tears he &s;hed, were tho&s;e of real friend&s;hip
and grief.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s remains were depo&s;ited in the church
of <HI>Richmond,</HI> under a plain &s;tone, without any in&s;crip|tion;
nor did his brother-poets at all exert them&s;elves
on the occa&s;ion, as they had lately done for one who
had been the terror of poets all his life-time. This
&s;ilence furni&s;hed matter to one of his friends for an ex|cellent
&s;atirical epigram, which we are &s;orry we can|not
give the reader. Only one gentleman, Mr. <HI>Collins,</HI>
who had lived &s;ome time at <HI>Richmond,</HI> but for&s;ook it
when Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> died, wrote an ode to his memory.
This, for the dirge-like melancholy it breathes, and the
warmth of affection that &s;eems to have dictated it, we
&s;hall &s;ubjoin to the pre&s;ent account.</P>
<P>Our author him&s;elf hints, &s;omewhere in his works,
that his exterior, was not the mo&s;t promi&s;ing; his make
being rather robu&s;t than graceful; though it is known
that in his youth he had been thought hand&s;ome.
His wor&s;t appearance was, when you &s;aw him walking
alone, in a thoughtful mood: but let a friend acco&s;t
him, and enter into conver&s;ation, he would in&s;tantly
brighten into a mo&s;t amiable a&s;pect, his features no
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">
longer the &s;ame, and his eye darting a peculiar animated
fire. The ca&s;e was much alike in company; where, if
it was mixed, or very numerous, he made but an in|different
figure: but with a few &s;elect friends, he was
open, &s;prightly, and entertaining. His wit flowed free|ly,
but pertinently, and at due intervals, leaving room
for every one to contribute his &s;hare. Such was his
extreme &s;en&s;ibility, &s;o perfect the harmony of his or|gans
with the &s;entiments of his mind, that his looks
always announced, and half expre&s;&s;ed, what he was
about to &s;ay; and his voice corre&s;ponded exactly to the
manner and degree in which he was affected. This
&s;en&s;ibility had one inconvenience attending it, that it
rendered him the very wor&s;t reader of good poetry: a
<HI>&s;onnet,</HI> or a copy of tame ver&s;es, he could manage
pretty well, or even improve them in the reading; but
a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Virgil, Milton</HI> or <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> would &s;ome|times
quite oppre&s;s him, that you could hear little el&s;e
than &s;ome ill-articulated &s;ounds, ri&s;ing as from the bot|tom
of his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>He had improved his ta&s;te upon the be&s;t originals,
ancient and modern; but could not bear to write what
was not &s;trictly his own, what had not more immedi|ately
&s;truck his imagination, or touched his heart: &s;o
that he is not in the lea&s;t concerned in that que&s;tion
about the <HI>merit</HI> or <HI>demerit</HI> of <HI>imitators.</HI> What he bor|rows
from the ancients, he gives us in avowed faith|ful
paraphra&s;e or tran&s;lation; as we &s;ee in a few pa&s;|&s;ages
taken from <HI>Virgil,</HI> and in that beautiful picture
from <HI>Pliny</HI> the eloer, where the cour&s;e and gradual
encrea&s;e of the <HI>Nile</HI> are figured by the &s;tages of man's
life.</P>
<P>The autumn was his favourite &s;ea&s;on for poetical
compo&s;ition, and the deep $word$ of the night, the time
<PB N="xvii" REF="19">
he commonly cho&s;e for &s;uch &s;tudies; &s;o that he would
often be heard walking in his library till near morning,
humming over, in his way, what he was to correct and
write out next day.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements of his lei&s;ure hours were civil and
natural hi&s;tory, voyages, and the relations of travel|lers,
the mo&s;t authentic he could procure: and had
his &s;ituation favoured it, he would certainly have ex|celled
in gardening, agriculture, and every rural im|provement
and exerci&s;e. Although he performed on
no in&s;trument, he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic, and
would &s;ometimes li&s;ten a full hour at his window to
the nightingales in <HI>Richmond</HI> gardens. While abroad,
he had been greatly delighted with the regular <HI>Italian</HI>
drama, &s;uch as <HI>Meta&s;ta&s;io</HI> writes; as it is there heigh|tened
by the charms of the be&s;t voices and in&s;truments;
and looked upon our theatrical entertainments as, in
one re&s;pect, naked and imperfect, when compared with
the <HI>ancient,</HI> or with tho&s;e of <HI>Italy;</HI> wi&s;hing &s;ometimes
that a <HI>chorus,</HI> at lea&s;t, and a better <HI>recitative,</HI> could be
introduced.</P>
<P>Nor was his ta&s;te le&s;s exqui&s;ite in the arts of <HI>paint|ing,
&s;culpture,</HI> and <HI>architecture.</HI> In his travels, he had
&s;een all the mo&s;t celebrated monuments of antiquity,
and the be&s;t productions of modern art: and &s;tudied
them &s;o minutely, and with &s;o true a judgment, that in
&s;ome of his de&s;criptions, in the poem of <HI>Liberty,</HI> we
have the ma&s;ter-pieces there mentioned placed in a
&s;tronger light perhaps than if we &s;aw them with our
eyes; at lea&s;t more ju&s;tly delineated than in any other
account extant: &s;o &s;uperior is a natural ta&s;te of the
<HI>grand</HI> and <HI>beautiful,</HI> to the traditional le&s;&s;ons of a com|mon
<HI>virtuo&s;o.</HI> His collection of prints, and &s;ome draw|ings
<PB N="xviii" REF="20">
from the antique, are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
friend, Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Richmond-hill.</HI></P>
<P>As for his more di&s;tingui&s;hing qualities of <HI>mind</HI> and
<HI>heart,</HI> they are better repre&s;ented in his writings, than
they can be by the pen of any biographer. There,
his love of mankind, of his country and friends; his
devotion to the <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> founded on the mo&s;t
elevated and ju&s;t conceptions of his operations and pro|vidence,
&s;hine out in every page. So unbounded was
his tenderne&s;s of heart, that it took in even the brute
creation: judge what it mu&s;t have been towards his
own &s;pecies. He is not indeed known, through his
whole life, to have given any per&s;on one moment's pain,
by his writings or otherwi&s;e. He took no part in the
poetical &s;quabbles which happened in his time; and
was re&s;pected and left undi&s;turbed by both &s;ides. He
would even refu&s;e to take offence when he ju&s;tly mighty;
by interrupting any per&s;onal &s;tory that was brought him,
with &s;ome je&s;t, or &s;ome humorous apology for the
offender. Nor was he ever &s;een ruffled or di&s;compo&s;ed,
but when he read or heard of &s;ome flagrant in&s;tance of
inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion or cruelty: then, indeed, the
&s;tronge&s;t marks of horror and indignation were vi&s;ible
in his countenance.</P>
<P>The&s;e amiable virtues, this divine temper of mind,
did not fail of their due reward. His friends loved him
with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor, and lamented his untimely
fate in the manner that is &s;till fre&s;h in every one's me|mory:
the be&s;t and greate&s;t men of his time honoured
him with their friend&s;hip and protection; the applau&s;e
of the public atended every appearance he made; the
actors, of whom the more eminent were his friends
and admirers, grudging no pains to do ju&s;tice to his
tragedies. At pre&s;ent, indeed, if we except <HI>Tancred,</HI>
<PB N="xix" REF="21">
they are &s;eldom called for; the &s;implicity of his plots,
and the models he worked after, not &s;uiting the reigning
ta&s;te, nor the impatience of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> theatre. They
may hereafter come to be in vogue; but we hazard no
comment or conjecture upon them, or upon any part of
Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s works; neither need they any defence or
apology, after the reception they have had at home,
and in foreign languages into which they have been
tran&s;lated. We &s;hall only &s;ay, that, to judge from the
imitations of his <HI>manner,</HI> which have been following him
clo&s;e, from the very fir&s;t publication of <HI>Winter,</HI> he
&s;eems to have fixed no incon&s;iderable aera of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
poetry.</P>

<HEAD>Anecdote of Mr. QUIN, the celebra|ted
PLAYER, and Mr. THOMSON,
AUTHOR of the SEASONS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Quin</HI> was a gentleman who&s;e wit and humour
gave life to the conver&s;ation of thou&s;ands, and
this anecdote reflects &s;o much honour to his memory,
and even to human nature; being &s;o full of genero&s;ity
and true benevolence, that not to make it as publick
and as la&s;ting as the SEASONS, would be a kind of
&s;ilent Robbery.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> a Scots gentleman, now univer&s;ally
known by his fine poems on the SEASONS, &amp;c. when
he fir&s;t came to <HI>London</HI> was in very narrow circum|&s;tances,
and before he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his wri|tings,
was many times put to his &s;hifts for a dinner.
<PB N="xx" REF="22">
The debts he then contracted, lay very heavy upon
him for a long time afterwards; and upon the publi|cation
of his SEASONS, one of his creditors arre&s;ted him,
thinking that a proper opportunity to get his money.
The report of this misfortune, reached the ears of Mr.
<HI>Quin,</HI> who had indeed read the SEASONS, but had ne|ver
&s;een their author; and upon &s;tricter enquiry, he
was told that <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was in the bailiff's hands at a
&s;punging-hou&s;e in <HI>Holbourn:</HI> thither <HI>Quin</HI> went, and
being admitted into his chamber, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, in his
u&s;ual tone of voice, <HI>You don't know me I believe, but my
name is Quin.</HI>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> received him very
politely, and &s;aid, <HI>that though he could not boa&s;t of the
honour of a per&s;onal acquaintance, he was no &s;tranger either
to his name or his merit;</HI> and very obligingly invited him
to &s;it down. <HI>Quin</HI> then told him, he was come to &s;up
with him, and that he had already ordered the cook to
provide &s;upper, which he hoped he would excu&s;e.&mdash;Mr.
<HI>Thom&s;on</HI> made the proper reply, and then the di&s;|cour&s;e
turned indifferently upon &s;ubjects of literature.
When &s;upper was over, and the gla&s;s had gone bri&s;kly
about, Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> then took occa&s;ion to explain him&s;elf
by &s;aying, <HI>It was now time to enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> Mr.
<HI>Thom&s;on</HI> declared he was ready to &s;erve him as far as his
capacity would reach, in any thing he &s;hould command,
(thinking he was come about &s;ome affair relating to the
Drama.) <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Quin, you mi&s;take my meaning.
I am in your debt. I owe you one hundred pounds, and I
am now come to pay you.</HI> Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> with a di&s;con|&s;olate
air, reply'd, that as he was a gentleman, whom,
to his knowledge, he had never offended, he wondered
he &s;hould &s;eek an opportunity to reproach him under
his misfortunes. No, by G&mdash;d, &s;aid <HI>Quin,</HI> rai&s;ing
his voice, I'd rather be d&mdash;n'd than in&s;ult the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.
<PB N="xxi" REF="23">
<HI>I &s;ay, I owe you one hundred pounds, and there it is</HI> (lay|ing
a bank-note of that value before him.) Mr.
<HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was a&s;toni&s;h'd and begged he would explain
him&s;elf. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Quin, I'll tell you; the exce&s;&s;ive
plea&s;ure I enjoyed in reading your</HI> SEASONS, <HI>con|&s;trained
me to become your debtor for one hundred pounds;
therefore when I made my</HI> WILL, <HI>among the re&s;t of
my legacies I &s;et down to the author of the</HI> SEASONS <HI>one
hundred pounds; and this day hearing that you was in
this hou&s;e, I thought I might as well have the plea&s;ure of
paying the money my&s;elf, as to leave the payment of it to
my executors, as probably that would be at a time when
you did not &s;o much need it; and this Mr.</HI> THOMSON <HI>is
the bu&s;ine&s;s I came about.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe
Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s grateful acknowledgments, but mu&s;t leave
every reader to conceive his exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations at &s;o
much unexpected GENEROSITY.</P>

<HEAD>The following Extract concerning this
Author&mdash;taken from the elegant Mr.
W&mdash;R T&mdash;N'S E&s;&s;ay on the Genius and
Writings of POPE,&mdash;wherein he
proves our THOMSON to be the DE|SCRIPTIVE
POET OF NATURE,&mdash;is
in&s;erted here for the Entertain|ment
of tho&s;e who have not had the
Happine&s;s of reading that excellent
Performance.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be unpardonable (&s;ays Mr. <HI>W&mdash;rt&mdash;n</HI>)
to conclude the&s;e remarks on de&s;criptive poe&s;y,
without taking notice of the SEASONS of <HI>Thomson,</HI> who
had peculiar and powerful talents for this &s;pecies of
composition. Let the reader therefore pardon a digre&s;&s;i|on,
if &s;uch it be, on his merits and character.</P>
<P><HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong and copious fancy;
he hath enriched poetry with a variety of new and ori|ginal
images, which he painted from nature it&s;elf, and
from his own actual ob&s;ervations: his de&s;criptions have
therefore a di&s;tinctne&s;s and truth, which are utterly
wanting to tho&s;e of poets who have only copied from
each other, and have never looked abroad on the ob|jects
them&s;elves. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> was accu&s;tomed to wander
away into the country for days and for weeks, attentive
to, &startq;each rural &s;ight, each rural &s;ound;&endq; while many
a poet who has dwelt for years in the <HI>Strand,</HI> has at|tempted
to de&s;cribe fields and rivers, and generally &s;uc|ceeded
accordingly. Hence that nau&s;eous repetition of
the &s;ame circum&s;tances; hence that di&s;gu&s;ting impro|priety
<PB N="xxiii" REF="25">
of introducing what may be called a &s;et of he|reditary
images, without proper regard to the age, or
climate, or occa&s;ion, in which they were formerly u&s;ed.
Though the diction of the SEASONS is &s;ometimes har&s;h
and inharmonious, and &s;ometimes turgid and ob&s;cure;
and though in many in&s;tances, the numbers are not
&s;ufficiently diver&s;i&s;ied by different pau&s;es, yet is this
poem on the whole, from the numberle&s;s &s;trokes of na|ture
in which it abounds, one of the mo&s;t captivating
and amu&s;ing in our language, and which, as its beauties
are not of a fugacious kind, as depending on particular
cu&s;toms and manners, will ever be peru&s;ed with delight.
The &s;cenes of <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> are frequently as wild and ro|mantic
as tho&s;e of Salvator Ro&s;a, plea&s;ingly varied with
precipices and torrents, and &startq;ca&s;tied cliffs,&endq; and deep

A minute and particular enumeration of circum&s;tances
judiciou&s;ly &s;elected, is what chiefly di&s;criminates poetry
from hi&s;tory, and renders the former, for that rea&s;on,
a more clo&s;e and faithful repre&s;entation of nature than
the latter. And if our poets would accu&s;tom them&s;elves
to contemplate fully every object, before they attempted
to de&s;cribe it, they would not &s;ail of giving their readers
more new images than they generally do.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations on <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> which however
would not have been &s;o large, if there had been already
<PB N="xxvii" REF="31">
any con&s;iderable critici&s;m on his character, might be &s;till
augmented by an examination and developement of the
beauties in the Loves of the birds in SPRING, ver&s;e
580. A view of the torrid zone in SUMMER, ver&s;e
626. The ri&s;e of fountains and rivers in AUTUMN,
ver&s;e 781. A man peri&s;hing in the &s;nows in WINTER,
ver&s;e 277. The wolves de&s;cending from the Alps, and
a view of winter within the polar circle, ver&s;e 809,
which are all of them highly-fini&s;hed originals, excepting
a few of tho&s;e blemi&s;hes intimated above. WINTER is
in my apprehen&s;ion the mo&s;t valuable of the&s;e four
poems; the &s;cenes of it, like tho&s;e of Il Pen&s;oro&s;o of
<HI>Milton,</HI> being of that awful, &s;olemn, and pen&s;ive kind
on which a great genius be&s;t delights to dwell.</P>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>The &s;ubject propo&s;ed. Addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. <HI>ONSLOW.</HI>
A pro&s;pect of the fields ready for harve&s;t. Reflections in
prai&s;e of indu&s;try, rai&s;ed by that view. Reaping. A
tale relative to it. A harve&s;t-&s;torm. Shooting and
hunting, their barbarity. A ludicrous account of
fox-hunting. A view of an orchard. Wall-fruit.
A vineyard. A de&s;cription of fogs, frequent in the
latter part of <HI>AUTUMN:</HI> whence a digre&s;&s;ion, en|quiring
into the ri&s;e of fountains and rivers. Birds
of &s;ea&s;on con&s;idered, that now &s;hift their habitation.
The prodigious number of them that cover the northern
and we&s;tern i&s;les of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence a view of
the country. A pro&s;pect of the di&s;coloured fading
woods. After a gentle du&s;ky day, moon-light. Au|tumnal
meteors. Morning: to which &s;ucceeds a calm,
pure, &s;un-&s;hiny day, &s;uch as u&s;ually &s;huts up the &s;ea|&s;on.
The harve&s;t being gathered in, the country di&s;|&s;olved
in joy. The whole concludes with a panygeric
on a philo&s;ophical country life.</Q>
