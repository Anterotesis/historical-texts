<HEAD>THE LIFE and CHARACTER of the late Capt. <HI>Goodere,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE having been many fal&s;e and injurious Reports &s;pread, and with great Indu&s;try propogated to the Di&s;advantage of a Gentleman who had been &s;o unhappy as to bring him&s;elf under the greate&s;t Di&s;advantage before, in order to do his Character Ju&s;tice, we &s;hall pro|ceed to give the following impartial Account of him.</P>
<P>Having thus pav'd the way to the Hi&s;tory of a Life, which the Hand of publick Ju&s;tice has put an End to, we &s;hall go up to the Fountain Head, and trace the unhappy Per&s;on, who is the principal Subject of the following Sheets; from his Cradle to his unexpected, much lamented, and mo&s;t deplorable Cata&s;trophe; we will begin with his Original, and follow him thro' the various Scenes of uncertain Life, till we view him a pub|lick Spectacle for one of the mo&s;t heinous Offences, in the &s;ight of God and Man, that human Na|ture is capable of.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be led, and that naturally enough too, or rather nece&s;&s;itated, in order to be full and faithful in our Memoirs, to bring the unfortu|nate
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Brother who fell in Ireland, with him who fell by the Captain's hand, and the Father of the unfortunate Family, as it may well be call'd, up-the Stage; and without injuring the Memories of the Dead; without fear of offering any offence on one hand, or fal&s;e incen&s;e on the other, to their &s;urviving Relations, we &s;hall as much record the behaviour of each, as may be con&s;i&s;tent with our de&s;ign of furni&s;hing out a Treati&s;e fit for publick Peru&s;al.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Samuel Goodere</HI> the mournful Subject which at pre&s;ent engro&s;&s;es our Attention, was the third, younge&s;t Son of Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> of <HI>Burhope</HI> in <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> Bart. by the only Daughter of Sir <HI>Edward Dineley</HI> of <HI>Charlton</HI> in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> Bart. and <HI>Frances,</HI> Si&s;ter to the Earl of <HI>Rockingham</HI>; and for the better explain|ing, how Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> came by the large E&s;tate he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, even in the Life-time of his Father Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> we mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing more particular on that Head, than there would otherwi&s;e be Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s Lady, as we have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, was the only Daughter, of Sir <HI>Edward Dineley,</HI> Bart. Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s E&s;tate was much inferior to what the young Lady was Heir to, at the time he courted her, not above a thou|&s;and Pounds a Year, whereas Mi&s;s <HI>Dineley,</HI> if her Father dy'd without any other I&s;&s;ue, was &s;ure if &s;he liv'd, of at lea&s;t three times as much: This Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> knew very well, and there|fore made his fir&s;t Addre&s;&s;es &s;ecretly to the young Lady her&s;elf, being determined to engage her Affections, if po&s;&s;ible, before he broke the Mat|ter to Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI>; and by this Method he
<PB N="5" REF="5">
&s;ucceed &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction that Mi&s;s <HI>Dine|ly</HI> became ab&s;olutely engaged to him, before her Father or Mother knew any thing of the Mat|ter.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured a main Point, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> thought he might now, &s;afely enough, propo&s;e the Match, which he did accordingly; but for a long time it met with great Oppo&s;ition from all, but Mi&s;s <HI>Dinely</HI> her&s;elf; who at length contriv'd a way to let her Father and her Mamma know, that &s;he was engaged, and had actually promi&s;ed, and &s;worn to Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> to have him, and to have nobody el&s;e: This had the de&s;ired Effect, for, rather than baulk the young Lady, force her to break her Word, or cro&s;s her Incli|nation, the Matter was made up; the Marriage was agreed to and completed. Mi&s;s <HI>Dinely</HI> had a hand&s;ome Fortune given her when &s;he married; but a much hand&s;omer afterwards; for at her Father's Death &s;he came in for the whole of the <HI>Dinely</HI> E&s;tate, which was rather better than Three Thou&s;and Pounds a Yea$; and this was by Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI>'s Will, who &s;ettled it, after her decea&s;e, upon her elde&s;t Son, by virtue of which, the late Sir <HI>John Dinely,</HI> <STAGE><HI>who was oblig'd by his Grandfath$r's Will to take the Name of Dinely</HI></STAGE> came in upon the Death of the Lady <HI>Goodere,</HI> his Mo|ther, for an E&s;tate, much &s;uperior to his own Father's: Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI> liv'd many Years after the Marriage of his Daughter, and within a few years as long as the Lady <HI>Goodere</HI> her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> had three Sons and one Daughter by this Lady, who was his only Wife, tho' he long &s;urviv'd her; and happy would it have been, con&s;idering what &s;ad Ends they have
<PB N="6" REF="6">
all come to, had neither of the Sons ever been born.</P>
<P>The Grandfather, by the Mother's Side, liv'd to &s;ee the two elde&s;t arrive to Man's E&s;tate, and the younge&s;t within a few Years of it. The elde&s;t Brother, as Heir Expectant of a very noble Fortune; had an Education &s;uitable to what he was one Day, had he lived, to come into the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and brought up a Gentleman; but the other two, when of a proper Age, and after having had an Education at School &s;uitable there|to, were &s;ent to Sea.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of the two had not been long at Sea, hardly long enough to commence Sailor, but an Accident happen'd, which gave a &s;udden Turn to his Fortune and Expectations in the World: An Accident, which brought him with|in View of both the Honour and E&s;tate he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of when he fell a Sacrifice to his Bro|ther's Re&s;entment and Cruelty.</P>
<P>And this Accident was the fir&s;t Misfortune which fell to the &s;hare of the unfortunate Off|&s;pring of Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>: His elde&s;t Son, who&s;e name was <HI>Edward,</HI> and call'd after his Fa|ther and Grandfather, by the Mother's Side, was then in <HI>Ireland</HI>; where a Gentleman and he hav|ing &s;ome Words, matters were at length car|ry'd &s;o high, that it was determined the Sword &s;hould decide the Quarrel; and they fought ac|cordingly: Mr. <HI>Goodere</HI> had the wor&s;t of it, and his lo$s of Life was the Con&s;equence of the En|gagement; thus fir&s;t fell the elde&s;t Son, to the in|expre&s;&s;ible Grief of his whole Family, and of Sir <HI>E$ward Dinely</HI> in particular, who had taken a more than ordinary liking to him, and had al|ways
<PB N="7" REF="7">
&s;hewn a very great Affection for him; which aro&s;e 'tis &s;aid, nor only from his being his elde&s;t Grand&s;on and his Name&s;ake, but from his Accom|pli&s;hments, and the Indications the young Gen|tleman early gave of his agreeable Acquirements, and many amiable Qualities of Body and Mind.</P>
<P>This young Gentleman being dead, his Brother then Heir, after his Mother, to the <HI>Dineley</HI> E&s;tate, was the lately murder'd Man: He was taken from Sea as &s;oon as could be done, and little did he ever think afterwards, that he &s;hould lo&s;e his Life on board a Ship; and e&s;pecially by the hands of his own Brother, till the hour which brought him to his Death, and his Murderers within al|mo&s;t &s;ight of theirs.</P>
<P>Bring at home, the late Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> &s;uc|ceeded, if not to the Affection his Father and Grandfather had for his decea&s;ed Brother, at lea&s;t to the Regards which had been paid to him, as the elde&s;t hopes of the Family, and now he was con|&s;idered as &s;uch, and treated as &s;uch by both; and in&s;tead of the Sailor he was de&s;ign'd for, they endeavoured to form him for the Gentleman, that he might become and fill up the higher Station in Life, Providence had given him a pro&s;pect of acting in: But the&s;e were attempts they were not over &s;ucce&s;sful in, there was &s;omething in his ca&s;t of Thought, in his turn of Mind, in his whole Frame and Con&s;titution which they could never tho|roughly get the better of; but found them&s;elves much baffled in the Methods they took to poli&s;h and refine his Memory, and render him the &s;ocial fine Gentleman his late Brother had given &s;o ma|ny Te&s;timonies of, had Providence thought fit to prolong'd his Days, and placed him in the
<PB N="8" REF="8">
&s;ituation the late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> at his Mother's Death came to be placed in. 'Tis much to be feared that it was greatly owing to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s un|&s;teadine&s;s of Temper, and to a too con&s;tant un|happine&s;s of behaviour, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, thro' the cour&s;e of many Years, that the Captain's Re|&s;entment aro&s;e again&s;t his Brother, and that the&s;e have been the main provocations to the dreadful Tragedy we have been witne&s;s to, and which the Friends to both have &s;o much Cau&s;e to lament.</P>
<P>The late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> being taken from Sea, as mention'd, was &s;ometimes with his Father in <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and &s;ometimes with his Grandfather in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire</HI>; being oblig'd by them both, <HI>and as &s;ome &s;ay, again&s;t his Will,</HI> to give over all Thoughts of returning to Sea, or of any other Employment or Bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;uch as was fit for a young Gentleman of Fortune to be engag'd in; but his Brother, the late Captain, was continu'd at Sea, as the way de&s;ign'd for his Advancement in the World; and he carry'd him&s;elf very well, got the good Word of the Captain he &s;ailed with, and behav'd much to the Satisfaction of his own Father.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI> did not long &s;urvive the Death of his Grand&s;on Mr. <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> whom he was extremely fond of; and 'twas even thought that the unhappy, untimely Fate, which that young Gentleman met with, did not a little contribute to the &s;hortening of his Days: This was &s;ucceeded by Lady <HI>Goodere</HI>'s Death, who, a few Years after her Father, paid the like Debt to Nature, and left the <HI>Dinely</HI> E&s;tate to become the Inheritance of the lately murder'd Baronet, and reduced his Fa|ther, Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> thereby to his original
<PB N="9" REF="9">
E&s;tate of about Eight Hundred or a Thou&s;and Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>This great Encrea&s;e of his Fortune might have made <HI>John Dinely,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>for he was no more during his Father's Life,</HI> one of the happie&s;t Men in the World; but, perhaps, if we were critically to examine the Matter, we &s;hould find it was the Cau&s;e of his Mi&s;conduct and Death.</P>
<P>He marry'd a Gentleman's Daughter near <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> an Heire&s;s; with whom he had Twenty Thou|&s;and Pounds, who, be&s;ides this opulent Fortune, to Youth and Beauty, was added every amiable Quality of Mind, and de&s;irable Accompli&s;hment, towards inhancing and compleating his Felicity; but the Lady's Endeavours to render Life agree|able to him, became in vain, and all her Wi&s;hes for his Happine&s;s were render'd abortive.</P>
<P>But all Men are not equal, or rather very few are &s;o, to &s;uperior Stations in Life which they are unexpectedly lifted up to; and which neither Na|ture or Education has fitted them for: Too much Wealth has undone many a Man, who&s;e encrea&s;e of Fortune has been &s;udden upon him; and the Pro&s;perity of Fools often de&s;troy them; an endle&s;s flow of Pro&s;perity and Fullne&s;s, with|out any change of Fortune, or a little Check in their career of Delights, make Men &s;ometimes grow giddy and intoxicated, and they run into Exce&s;&s;es, which, for wanting of &s;ome Rubbs in their way, they are not as they ought to be, upon their guard again&s;t; and this &s;eems to have been too much the Ca&s;e, upon many Occa&s;ions, with the unfortunate Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI>: He often, too often, gave way to his Re&s;entments, and too great a loo&s;e to his Plea&s;ures, and in &s;hort the whole
<PB N="10" REF="10">
tenour of his Conduct, for a &s;eries of Years, was &s;uch, and &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with his Brother's, the unhappy Captain <HI>Goodere</HI>'s Behaviour, that the one &s;unk whil&s;t the other ro&s;e in the E&s;teem and good Opinion of Mankind; and one gain'd upon, whil&s;t the other lo&s;t the Affections of Friends and Relations; tho' this Difference in their manner of Life, and ways of Management was not &s;o con&s;picuous, or did Matters come to the great Extremity they at la&s;t arrived at, till many Years after they were both married; and the late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> had a Son drawing on apace towards Manhood, which he had but little more than ar|rived to when he died, who&s;e Death and coming to Age, open'd more Breaches than one, that never have been clos'd &s;ince.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e we &s;hall be oblig'd to take No|tice of, as it will be a Means to a&s;&s;i&s;t our come|ing at the real Motives which could induce a Gentleman, who was always di&s;tingui&s;h'd for great Honour and Probity; and as remarkable for his great Humanity and Tenderne&s;s, to dive&s;t him&s;elf of all the&s;e at once; and break through all the Ties of Nature, mo&s;t &s;acriligiou&s;ly to im|brue his Hands in the Blood of his own, and only Brother. The other are Breaches of too ten|der a Nature for us to touch upon; nor is it re|qui&s;ite we &s;hould, they are of too private, too much a family Concern, and it would be making the Wounds to bleed a fre&s;h, for the Publick to be made acquainted with them.</P>
<P>But to return more immediately to Capt. <HI>Good|ere,</HI> he began the World in the Merchants Service; and learnt the fir&s;t Rudiments of Naviga$ion, (ex|cept what he had been furni&s;h'd with in Theory
<PB N="11" REF="11">
at School) in the Merchant-way; when have|ing made &s;everal Voyages in &s;afety, and gained the good Word and good Will of the Captains he &s;ail'd with, and being withal duly qualify'd, he got the Command of a Ve&s;&s;el, in the Mer|chant Service him&s;elf; and in that Station made two or three Voyages with Succe&s;s; but his Views enlarging with his Years and Experience he was determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to get preferment in the Navy; and pur&s;uant to this Re&s;olution, enter'd him&s;elf on board a Man of War, in the Reign of her late Maj$&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> His Father, &s;oon after his going on board, pro|cured him a Commi&s;&s;ion and when he had &s;erved &s;ome Time, according to the Rules pre&s;cribed by the Navy, got him made a Lieutenant be|fore her Maje&s;ty's Death: All this Time he con|ducted him&s;elf &s;uitable to his Birth, to his own hopes of Preferment, and to Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s Wi&s;hes and Expectations.</P>
<P>And if he behav'd well abroad, he did the &s;ame at home; and &s;o became his Father's fa|vourite Son, the Son in whom he mo&s;t confided; with whom he conver&s;ed mo&s;t and oftne&s;t, and the Son he &s;eldom or never cared to enter upon any thing of Con&s;equence or Moment, after the Death of his Lady, without having fir&s;t con&s;ulted him. As his judicious Behaviour, and dutiful Carriage to his own Father, gained him his paternal Regard and Affection; &s;o his Sobriety, good Nature, free Conver&s;ation, and Candour, di&s;coverable upon all Occa&s;ions, gain'd him the Love of his Acquaintance and the general E&s;teem of the whole Country; and we may, with great Truth a&s;&s;ert, that 'till he became guilty of the late direful
<PB N="12" REF="12">
Action, the unhappy Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI> had as valua|ble and as well e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Character in <HI>Hereford|&s;hire,</HI> and in every other place where he came, and was known, as a Gentleman of his Station in Life, could hope for or de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Soon after he was made a Lieutenant, with the Con&s;ent of Relations on both Sides, he was mar|ry'd to a young Gentlewoman of a worthy Fami|ly, and who is much too worthy and valuable in her&s;elf, to have her Maiden Name mention'd upon this mi&s;erable, melancholy Occa&s;ion; who is in|con&s;oleable for the dreadful Di&s;a&s;ter befallen her Brother in Law; for the Di&s;grace and Infamy brought upon her Children, and for the more dreadful Doom her wretched Husband brought upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Captain had a hand&s;ome Fortune with his Lady, and equal to the E&s;tate his Father &s;ettled upon him, and they was as happy in each other, and always liv'd as happily and as hand|&s;omely together, as tho&s;e always do who&s;e Hearts, as well as Intere&s;ts are united, and make in their continual Study, by every Act of Kindne&s;s in their power, to be endearing them&s;elves to one another; and indeed he mu&s;t have been a Brute of a Man, who could have made a bad Husband to Mrs. <HI>Goodere,</HI> who is by univer&s;al Con&s;ent al|low'd, to be as good a Woman as ever was born.</P>
<P>The Differences between the Captain and his Brother grew now every Day greater; and an ir|reconcileable Enmity &s;eem'd to have commenced; the late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> took, as the Captain &s;aid, a cau&s;ele&s;s and an unju&s;tifiable Antipathy at him; and &s;hewed he had done &s;o whenever he
<PB N="13" REF="13">
could. In &s;hort they now oppos'd each other up|on all Occa&s;ions when it was po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;hew their private Re&s;entments; and appear'd in publick in as different Intere&s;ts as if they were de|termined the World &s;hould be witne&s;s to their in|veterate hatred of each other.</P>
<P>But the Captain was not the only Per&s;on whom Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> u&s;ed ill, and it was thought that the Captain's taking of his Lady's part again&s;t him, for Sir <HI>John</HI>'s unkind u&s;age of her, was one of the principal Rea&s;ons of his per&s;ecuting the Captain with &s;o much Ill-nature and Rancour.</P>
<P>Such was the Difference in the Behaviour of the two Brothers, that the Gentry in general con|demn'd that of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s, and the Father not aba|ting of his Fondne&s;s for the Captain, added Fuel to that Flame which already burnt but too fierce|ly, and made a Compromi&s;e of their Differences more difficult, than otherwi&s;e perhaps it might have proved. Sir <HI>John</HI>'s high Spirit could not brook this &s;ort of Treatment, and he gave into the fatal Re&s;olution, fatal indeed, as 'tis fear'd it has &s;ince prov'd to him&s;elf, of cutting off the Entail of his E&s;tate, as &s;oon as his Son &s;hould come of Age to join with him in it, and di&s;in|heriting his Brother, if his Son dy'd without I&s;&s;ue Male.</P>
<P>The late Sir <HI>John</HI> kept to what he had &s;o ra&s;hly re&s;olved on; and, when the young Gentle|man came of Age, he oblig'd him to join with him in his De&s;ign of di&s;inheriting his Uncle, and cut off the Entail accordingly; and &s;ettled the E&s;tate upon his only Si&s;ter, who was married to one Mr. <HI>Fote,</HI> a Gentleman belonging to the Law, and after her Decea&s;e, upon her elde&s;t Son.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">This was undoubtedly a Tran&s;action which irri|tated and exa&s;perated Capt. <HI>Goodere,</HI> more than any thing his Brother had done before, or could have done but this; and more &s;o when he heard of the Death of Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI>'s Son, who, as we &s;ince &s;aid, died pre&s;ently afterwards; and 'tis much to be apprehended that the unhappy Captain meditated the direful Revenge he has &s;ince taken, for &s;uch an Indignity and Injury offer'd to him and his Children, by this unkind Act; however, he &s;mother'd his great Re&s;entment for &s;everal Years, and 'till the Death of old Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> their Father; when the Captain met with fre&s;h Di&s;appointment, and Matter to enrage him &s;till more; and when 'tis believed he became more ab&s;olutely determin'd, than ever he had been, of putting his bloody De&s;ign on foot, when-ever Time would favour him with an Opportunity of performing it effectually.</P>
<P>There were many other Quarrels between the two Brothers, which as we have hinted, we could write at large and give the World all the Particu|lars of, but tho&s;e we think &s;hould now be bury'd in everla&s;ting Oblivion: If the unfortunate Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> was to blame, as undoubtedly he was in many of them, he has paid dearly for his having been to blame; and we would not di&s;turb his A&s;hes, with any recapitulation of his Weakne&s;s and Mi&s;carriages in Times pa&s;t; and if the Cap|tain has likewi&s;e been to blame, we would equal|ly avoid adding to the Grief of his afflicted Fa|mily, by a Rehear&s;al of his Faults, who has ac|counted for them all, and received from the Ju&s;tice of his Country a Puni&s;hment equal to the crying Sin he has been guilty of, if it is within the Power
<PB N="15" REF="15">
of Man to inflict a Puni&s;hment equal to &s;o heinous an Offence.</P>
<P>To go back then to Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI> who was Lieutenant of a Man of War; he carry'd him&s;elf in a becoming manner to all below him, as well as to all above him, he became beloved by both Officers and Sailors, and &s;hewed great intrepidity and re&s;olution upon all Occa&s;ions; tho' whil&s;t he continued a Lieutenant he had not perform'd any remarkable Exploit in his Station, &s;o as to make him&s;elf be taken Notice of, yet in time of Action, or any imminent Danger by Storms and Tempe&s;t at Sea, he di&s;covered &s;uch Calmne&s;s of Mind and undaunted Courage and Bravery, that he &s;oon got his Reputation e&s;tabli&s;h'd for as gallant a young Fellow as any in the Navy.</P>
<P>Had he been otherwi&s;e, he never would been $ble to have procur'd his Father's E&s;teem and Value $or him as he did to the la&s;t: Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> was him&s;elf look'd upon as gallant a Man in his Days as ever drew a Sword in <HI>Britain</HI>; &s;o that Courage was part of his hereditary Inheritance, $nd as his Father u&s;ed to &s;ay, was he to have had $ Son who did not dare fight, he &s;hould think the $oward a Ba&s;tard, and that he had none of his $lood in him; and de&s;erv'd to be di&s;inherited.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI> continued many Years a Lieute|$$nt only, &s;ometimes in full, but now in half pay, $$d it was very lately that he was able to get a $aptain's Commi&s;&s;ion; the reports which have $$$ely flown about of &s;everal brave and gallant $ctions perform'd by the late Captain, upon the $a&s;t of Spain, are all fictitious, and mere inven|$$$ns, without any Foundation; the Poor unhap|$$ Man, not having drawn any Blood, &s;ince he
<PB N="16" REF="16">
was made a Captain, but what was &s;ome of the &s;ame, which run in his own Veins, and for the commi&s;&s;ion of which he has paid the forfeiture of his own Life.</P>
<P>Not any thing de&s;erving particular remark, or worth taking Notice of in the Captain's publick Life is to be found, till he comes to the Command of the <HI>Ruby</HI> Man of War, and even then, only that, which we could heartily wi&s;h there was not &s;o much dreadful Rea&s;on as there is, to remem|ber with Horror: The <HI>Ruby</HI> has been an unhappy Ship to the two la&s;t Captains of her; Captain <HI>Goodere</HI>'s immediate Predece&s;&s;or on board, &s;hot him|&s;elf, as 'tis &s;aid; and in the very Place where the Ship rode, where her la&s;t Commander contam|minated his Fingers, and dyed them in his Bro|ther's Blood.</P>
<P>But we are under the obligation to go once more into private Life, with the Captain and hi$ unfortunate Brother Sir <HI>John Dineley Goodere</HI>; and explain a Circum&s;tance or two, which put th$ fini&s;hing hand to the Work, and brought to Per+fection what was before but in Embrio: Abou$ two Years ago happened the Demi&s;e of their Fa+ther Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> who to &s;hew that hi$ Regard for the Captain and his Family was wel$ founded, te&s;tify'd they were &s;o by his Will; leav+ing Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> only Tenant for Life of h$ E&s;tate at <HI>Burghope</HI> in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and the Se$ of the Family, and which at Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Deat$ was to go to the Captain: This u&s;age of th$ Father provoked Sir <HI>John,</HI> but that it &s;hould be $ was &s;omething &s;urprizing, &s;ince it was no mor$ or rather much le&s;s than what he had no litt$$ Rea&s;on to expect; for it had for &s;ometime befo$$
<PB N="17" REF="17">
been currently reported, that Sir <HI>Edward</HI> intend|ed to have cut him off from every Shilling, which it was in his Power to have hindered him of; and leave the Whole immediately to the Captain, and &s;o much did this Report gain Credit in <HI>Here|ford&s;hire,</HI> that it was generally believ'd, this would have been the Ca&s;e, had not Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s &s;udden Sickne&s;s and Death prevented the execu|tion of his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Tho' if Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> was di&s;appointed and di&s;plea&s;ed at being left only Tenant for Life, the Captain was as much baulk'd at finding that his Father had not been &s;o kind to him, as he was in hopes he would have been; and left that E&s;tate to him, which for &s;ome time he had lived in the full expectation of; Some little Conte&s;t aro&s;e hereup|on, which, <HI>for us,</HI> &s;hall be namele&s;s, and had better be forgot than remembered, for the &s;ake of both Sides? however it would be doing of the Captain great Inju&s;tice, not to let it be known, that he acquie&s;sc'd in what his Father had done, and behaved much better than his Brother upon the Occa&s;ion, for &s;o little was Sir <HI>John</HI> from brook|ing of the Inju&s;tice which he pretended, his Fa|ther had done him, that he would &s;hew his Re|&s;entment even to his dead Remains and carry'd his Di&s;gu&s;t to the Grave.</P>
<P>To offer all the Indignity to his Father's Corp&s;e in his Power, he not only deny'd it all the Ho|nours due to his Birth and Fortune, but even a decent Interment, and unattended Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was carry'd to his Grave, and &s;o much of a piece was the whole, that neither Shroud or Coffin was &s;o good as a Gentleman would bury a Servant in, or as are often &s;een for our Pari&s;h Poor; this ig|nomious
<PB N="18" REF="18">
Treatment of his Father, and of a Gen|tleman who had always lived hand&s;omely, had be|haved well, and been a generous Benefactor to the Poor, rai&s;ed the Indignation of all Ranks of Peo|ple, and the whole Country exclaimed loudly again Sir <HI>John</HI>'s &s;hameful U&s;age of him; &s;uch a &s;candalous Sight had not ever been &s;een in that Country before, and was &s;uch, as 'tis very likely may never be matched either in that, or in any o|ther Chri&s;tian Country again.</P>
<P>But if others were di&s;plea&s;ed and grieved at this &s;hocking Tran&s;action, the Captain was enraged and incen&s;ed at it, to the highe&s;t Degree; and this di&s;honour, as he look'd upon it to be done to his deceas'd Father and to his Family, blew up the Coals afre&s;h, and re-kindled the Fire which was not extingui&s;hed 'till quench'd with the Blood of him who was chiefly in&s;trumental in making it burn with Fury.</P>
<P>The Captain was now fully determined to di&s;|patch Sir <HI>John,</HI> and had form'd divers Schemes to effect his barbarous Re&s;olution, and at la&s;t con|cluded on the very one which was afterwards put in Execution. The Account he gave of the whole Scene of that tragical Affair was as follows:</P>
<P><HI>That about the Beginning of the Month of</HI> January <HI>la&s;t he &s;poke to</HI> Charles Bryan, Edward M'Daniel <HI>and</HI> William Hammond, <HI>and to his Confederates</HI> Mahony <HI>and</HI> White <HI>about &s;eizing the Captain. They &s;eemed at fir&s;t aver&s;e to the Propo&s;al he made them of giving them Money, to &s;eize the Decea&s;ed and carry him on board the</HI> Ruby, <HI>but advancing them &s;ome|thing con&s;iderable in Hand, and</HI> Mahony <HI>&s;piriting them on, by plying them well with Liquor, they made no great Difficulty to come into the Captain's Mea|&s;ures;

that they din'd at the</HI> White Hart <HI>on</HI> College Green <HI>the Day the Murder was committed, and that after Dinner, while the before-nam'd Per&s;ons were regaling them&s;elves, he went to Mr.</HI> Smith<HI>'s, an Attorney on</HI> College Green, <HI>and begg'd of that Gen|tleman to introduce him to the deceas'd Sir</HI> John, <HI>that he might have an Opportunity to &s;peak to him, and that he did not then doubt but he &s;hould accom|modate all Differences that were &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them. This Gentleman, not having the lea&s;t Su&s;pi|cion of any ill Intention of the Captain's, was very ready to bring them together; and as both Brothers were his intimate Acquaintance, it gave him a good deal of Plea&s;ure to &s;ee a Reconciliation. He &s;ays, that his Pre&s;ence &s;urprized his Brother; but the before-mention'd Gentleman informing him of the Cau&s;e of his $oming, Sir</HI> John <HI>&s;hook Hands, ta&s;k'd &s;ome Time with $im, and de&s;ir'd he would &s;it down; that he (the Captain) was unea&s;y, le&s;t the Fellows who were at $he</HI> White Hart <HI>&s;hould drink too much; and when $he Evening was clos'd, he per&s;uaded Sir</HI> John <HI>to $$rry no longer; and as &s;oon as they had left the $ou&s;e, and got on the Green, he gave the watch $$$rd to</HI> Mahony <HI>(who &s;tood with his Comrades in $$e Balcony) and they all in&s;tantly ru&s;h'd on Sir</HI> John <HI>$$d &s;eiz'd him: That Sir</HI> John <HI>cry'd,</HI> Brother, $other, what's the Matter?

&s;peak: That as they hurried him along, he was ready to drop; &s;o four of the Men, before-mentioned, car|ried him, and</HI> Mahony <HI>follow'd, telling any Per&s;on who came along, that the Man they had got was a De&s;erter, and had run away with the King's Bounty Money, and was carrying on board to be put in Irons for his Tryal by a Court Martial: That as &s;oon as they got him in the Boat, the three Men fir&s;t-mentioned left him, and the others, with the Captain's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, carried him on board the</HI> Ruby, <HI>where he lay &s;everal Hours before he was &s;trangled, crying out, that they had brought him on board to kill him: This was in a Cabin which was not made u&s;e of, either by Officers or any of the Ship's Crew, but re|&s;erv'd for the Captain to entertain Friends who came on board to &s;ee him, and cho&s;e to tarry all Night. This Outcry was not overheard but by few of the Crew, who were told, the Deceas'd was a Madman and brought on board purpo&s;ely that he might not de|&s;troy him&s;elf; but the Murder being di&s;covered by the Cooper of the Ship, the Scheme was not effected; which, as the Captain has confe&s;s'd, was after Sir</HI> John <HI>was &s;trangled, to heave him overboard, and pretend he had got up in the Night, gone out of his Cabin, and accidentally fell into the Sea; and to make this &s;tory the more plau&s;ible,</HI> Mahony <HI>and</HI> White <HI>(who were the two Murderers) were to &s;ay, that they &s;aw the Captain and Sir</HI> John <HI>drinking Punch, and that the Baronet was in Liquor, an$ his Brother pulling him to go to Bed, but that he re|fu&s;ed to go before he made him &s;ome more Punch, a$ the &s;ame Time &s;wearing he would never more come o$ board the Ship, for that the Captain did not tre$ him hand&s;omely to grudge him Liquor.

and the Centry, who&s;e Place I had taken, &s;eeing me without a Candle, brought one to the Cabbin-Door, but I held my Sword to his Brea&s;t, and order'd him to keep back &mdash; and this was the very Time that my poor Brother was giving his la&s;t Ga&s;p; for about a Minute before, I heard him &s;ay, <HI>Oh my poor Life!</HI> and this was the la&s;t Word he ever &s;poke.</P>
<P>In a Minute or two after the Decea&s;ed expired, both <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> came out of the Cabbin, and I asked if he was dead? They &s;aid he was: And then I went into the Cabbin, and felt my Brother's Corp&s;e, and then lock'd the Cabbin Door, and put the Key into my Pocket, and or|der'd <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Mahony</HI> to attend me in my Cabbin, where I went and &s;at down. <HI>Mahony</HI> came in fir&s;t, and &s;aid D&mdash;&mdash;mn me, Captain, we have done it, Boy. Then Ma|hony gave me my Brother's Gold Watch, and I gave him in return a Silver one, that I wore. As to the Money they took out of his Pockets, they &s;har'd it, each having up|wards of 14l. tho' <HI>White</HI> had the mo&s;t Ca&s;h, becau&s;e <HI>Ma|hony</HI> had the Watch. About four o'Clock they went into the Yaul, and got on Shore, I having promi&s;ed to &s;end them Tickets for three Weeks or a Month's Ab&s;ence from the Ship.</P>
<P>As to the Di&s;po&s;al of the Decea&s;ed's Body, we intended to have concealed it 'till the Ship &s;ail'd, and flung it over|board &s;ew'd up in a Hammock; or if it had been di&s;cover|ed before, then I intended to have prov'd by <HI>Mahony,</HI> that the Decea&s;ed &s;trangled him&s;elf and could have influenced a Jury to have brought him in Lunatick.</P>
<P>I cannot help reflecting on my Conduct in this unhappy Affair, and what makes a great Impre&s;&s;ion on me is, when my Brother was fir&s;t brought into the Bo$$, he told me, <HI>He knew my Intent was to murder him: And</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>why don't your Men throw me over-board now; and then you may go a&s;hore, and hang your&s;elf on the Boats Fore Sheet.</HI> Ju&s;tice has mo&s;t de&s;ervedly overtaken me; and what gives me the greate&s;t Concern is, that the Death of the&s;e two poor Crea|tures <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> lies at my Door. Pray God for|give me; for &s;ure never was any Man guilty of &s;o much Wickedne&s;s. As to what the Witne&s;&s;es &s;wore on my Trial, I can contradict no Part of it. They did their Duty, and I forgive them, as I hope, through the Merits of my dear Saviour, the Almighty will forgive me.</P>
<P>This is the Account the Captain gave of the Murder to the Clergymen who attended him, and

to &s;ome of his particular Friends who vi&s;ited him while he was under Confinement; but it was re|markable, that he would not confe&s;s any thing till within a few Days of Execution; for on Thur&s;day the 2d Day of this In&s;tant <HI>April,</HI> the Captain's Lady got a Petition, &s;igned by a great many Gentlemen of Credit and Reputation, in his Behalf, pre&s;ented to the King, recommend|ing him her Husband as an Object of Compa&s;|&s;ion; but the Petition had no Effect, and Advice thereof being carried to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the Captain &s;eem|ed perfectly compos'd, and &s;aid he knew he de|&s;erved Death, and therefore would prepare him|&s;elf to die; and on the Saturday, as &s;oon as he received Advice that his Petition was rejected he &s;ent to all the Churches in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to be particu|larly pray'd for, and he was accordingly pray'd for, by Name, throughout the whole City, as were al&s;o his two Confederates <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> during the Time they remained under Sentence of Death, as well on Sundays, as at Times of pub|lick Prayer.</P>
<P>We forgot to mention the Fate of the Villains, viz. <HI>Charles Bryan, Edward Mac Daniel,</HI> and <HI>William Hammon</HI> (who fir&s;t &s;eized Sir <HI>John</HI>) who were taken up &s;oon after the Murder. The&s;e three were try'd and found guilty of an A&s;&s;ault, and each &s;entenc'd to pay a Fine of 40 s. to re|main clo&s;e Pri&s;oners for the Space of one Year, and find &s;ufficient Sureties for their good Behavi|our for 12 Months after: A very mild Sentence for &s;uch Villains, who 'tis certain knew Mr <HI>Goodere</HI>'s De&s;ign in &s;eizing his Brother in &s;uch $ Manner, tho' the Law could not prove them a$ Acce&s;&s;aries in the Murder. <HI>White</HI> indeed had lik$

to have e&s;cap'd the Gallows, for when the Bill of Indictment was preferr'd to the Grand Jury, the Names of <HI>Goodere</HI> and <HI>Mahony</HI> were only in&s;erted, but the Gentlemen of the Grand Inque&s;t finding there was &s;ufficient Proof to convict all three, a Bill was then preferr'd again&s;t <HI>White</HI> (who was before intended as an Evidence for the King) and he was al&s;o found guilty; and this was the Rea&s;on they were not all try'd on one Day, the Captain and <HI>Mahony</HI> being try'd on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> and <HI>White</HI> on the <HI>Saturday</HI> following, the very Day they all re|ceived Sentence of Death.</P>
<P>The Captain, in pa&s;&s;ing from the Court Hou&s;e, where he had received Sentence, to Newgate, bow'd to &s;everal People, and pull'd of his Hat three Times but appear'd deeply affected, and look'd to the Ground, wrapping him&s;elf clo&s;e in his Scarlet Cloak, the Goaler and two Servants attending him. <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> were both &s;trongly guarded, and put into the Condemned Hold, and three Days after they had received Sentence, an order came to the Goal that <HI>Mahony</HI> (as he had all along been a principal Actor in this Tragedy) &s;hould after his Execution be hang'd up in Chains as near as po&s;&s;ible where the Fact was committed.</P>
<P>As to the Captain's Behaviour in Pri&s;on, it was &s;uch as became a Man in his unhappy Circum|&s;tances, for he behaved penitent to the la&s;t. He was often vi&s;ited by his Wife, and their taking leave of each other was a very moving Scene, and can be only imagined by tho&s;e, who after a long and &s;trict Union of Hearts and Affections, feel the Pangs of Separation. In him Grief appear'd with a &s;ilent gloomy A&s;pect, and whil&s;t Tears,
<PB N="24" REF="24">
in large Drops, roll'd down his manly Cheeks, a few, &s;hort, broken Sentences &s;poke more the An|gui&s;h of his Heart, and unutterable Concern for his Wife and Children. As to his Wife, her Tears, the wringing her Hands, &amp;c. &s;ufficiently te&s;tify'd the Va&s;tne&s;s of her Grief, her Heart was, as it were rent in two, and all the dreadful To|kens of the mo&s;t abandon'd De&s;pair appear'd in every Ge&s;ture, in every Action and Motion, and the mo&s;t terrifying Agonies were beheld in every di&s;torted Feature of her Countenance. What can be &s;aid more, than that &s;he &s;eem'd not only the lively Picture of Grief, but even Grief it&s;elf, with all its di&s;mal Attendants, Horror, Angui&s;h, and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>On the Day he &s;uffered he ro&s;e at Day-break, and was very fervent in Prayer until the Officers came to demand his Body; the Goaler's Servant, who attended him, went up and told him the Of|ficers waited, and his Reply was, <HI>I am ready as &s;oon as they plea&s;e.</HI> He then gave the Man &s;ome Silver out of his Pocket, and went down directly, de&s;iring the Spectators pre&s;ent to pray for him.</P>
<P>They were carried to Execution in the Morn|ing, among&s;t a va&s;t Crowd of Spectators, and, after &s;ome &s;hort Prayers at the Gallows, were turn'd off, as they were calling on God to receive their Souls. The Captain's Body was cut down in le&s;s than 20 Minutes, and put into a Hear&s;e, in order for a decent Burial.</P>
<P><HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> were both <HI>Iri&s;hmen,</HI> under 30; the latter born in <HI>Drogeda.</HI> They dy'd Ro|man Catholicks. They &s;aid they forgave the Captain, as they hop'd to be forgiven. <HI>White</HI> was buried the &s;ame Night, and <HI>Mahony</HI> hung up in Irons.</P>
