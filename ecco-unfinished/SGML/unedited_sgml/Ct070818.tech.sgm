<HEAD>The Ca&s;e of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters
in Carolina.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LIberty</HI> being the only &s;ure and la&s;ting Foundation of our Quiet
and Satisfaction in this World, a Community can never be
reduc'd to any State, in which it will not have a right to
u&s;e all Methods, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure that Liberty
when it is in danger, or to regain it when it is lo&s;t: Nor can there
be any Condition of any &s;ingle Per&s;on in that Community imagin'd
or devis'd, in which it will not be his truer Intere&s;t to give his A&s;&s;i&s;tance
to &s;ecure or recover the Liberty of that Community, than to endanger
or de&s;troy it, tho he were by that means to get all the Power of the Com|munity
into his own Hands. For how much &s;oever he might think it for
his Intere&s;t to in&s;lave others; yet it may be thought as much for the In|tere&s;t
of others to in&s;lave him. And the &s;ure&s;t way to &s;ecure him&s;elf a|gain&s;t
coming into &s;o ba&s;e and mi&s;erable a Condition, is no longer to
in&s;i&s;t upon governing his Actions towards others, by his own licentious
and uncertain Humor, le&s;t another &s;hould pretend to act as arbitrari|ly
and uncertainly towards him: But to &s;ubmit, that his own Actions
as well as the Actions of all others &s;hould be bound by a &s;tated and
certain Rule; which when he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es, will bring him under
greater Inconveniences than can be compen&s;ated by the Advantages,
which may accrue to him by the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. And this very Re|&s;traint
that Men put them&s;elves under, &s;ecuring to 'em as far as may be
at the &s;ame time, the Freedom of acting according to a known and
&s;tated Rule, is what we call Liberty: And being the Foundation of all
their other Privileges, is what it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be their common In|tere&s;t
to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>And as Liberty is the only Foundation of our Quiet and Satisfaction
in this World; &s;o <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience</HI> is the only Security that any Go|vernment
can give us for our &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age thro this World to another.
And Liberty of Con&s;cience being a Liberty for every Man to believe
what appears to him to be true, and to act pur&s;uant to his Belief in
matters relating to another Life, that don't di&s;turb the Publick
Peace; 'tis no wonder, if Men are generally &s;o much more tender of
this Branch of Liberty, than they are of any other: Becau&s;e both the
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Intere&s;ts of another World are infinitely more our Concern to &s;ecure,
than the Ea&s;e and Satisfaction of the pre&s;ent; and that even our
Civil Liberty it &s;elf becomes precarious and defea&s;ible, where the
Liberty of Mens Con&s;ciences has not the &s;tronge&s;t Securitys that may
be. For People can never be &s;ure that a Government will not force
'em to act according to its uncertain and arbitrary Determinations,
in matters that relate to the Peace of the Community, in&s;tead of
allowing them the Freedom to act according to a &s;tated and certain
Rule, which will not allow 'em the Liberty to act according to their own
Opinion, in matters which relate not at all to the Community: Nay in
matters, which as they can do no body good or hurt be&s;ides them&s;elves;
&s;o in matters which can do them no good or hurt, but in relation to
another World: And whether they will do them any good or hurt in
that re&s;pect, can't be known to the Government neither.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e will be apt to think them&s;elves le&s;s &s;ecure of Civil Liberty,
after once their Religious Libertys have been violated, who con&s;ider,
that Governments being erected for the Good of the Community, may
have a right in &s;ome extraordinary Ca&s;es to break in upon the known
and &s;tated Rules of acting, in order to a Publick Good; which the Poli|ticians
have call'd <HI>Jus Dominationis.</HI> But that they can never have
a right to hinder the Liberty that all Men have to think, and act in
matters of Faith and Wor&s;hip, as &s;hall &s;eem to them mo&s;t rea&s;onable
and convenient; becau&s;e the Good of the Society can never require it,
unle&s;s it can require a Government to tempt Men to turn Knaves and
Villains, for Knavery and Villany &s;ake: For that is all that Per&s;ecution
and Violence offer'd to Mens Con&s;ciences can be de&s;ign'd to do. So that
in a word, if any Government breaks in upon the Liberty of Con&s;cience,
it breaks in upon an indefea&s;ible Right of the People, and commits a Vi|olation,
which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily turn to the Prejudice of the Community;
and may therefore much more ea&s;ily break in upon Civil Liberty, which
$ho very &s;acred, mu&s;t be allow'd to be defea&s;ible, and lawfully to be bro|ken
in upon in &s;uch Ca&s;es, where the Good of the Community ab&s;olutely
requires it. And when a Government has once broken in upon the Li|berty
of any one Man's Con&s;cience, or upon the Con&s;ciences of any Body
of Men, Civil Liberty is not only thereby endanger'd, but no other Body
of Men can promi&s;e them&s;elves any <HI>la&s;ting Security</HI> for the Liberty
of their Con&s;ciences. For tho &s;ome religious Bodys of Men may
have better Securitys than others, yet there can be no Security to any,
that can outlive the Change of Opinion in the Government, but that
of an Univer&s;al and Ab&s;olute Toleration: Which indeed can hardly
ever be de&s;troy'd. Becau&s;e it will never be the Intere&s;t of the Go|vernment
to de&s;troy it, however the Government may happen to
<PB N="5" REF="4">
change their Opinion in Religion; and becau&s;e 'twill always be the In|tere&s;t
of every Man that is &s;ubject to that Government, to take all
proper Methods to pre&s;erve it. We have &s;een all the Laws, made in
our own Country for the Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> repeal'd
and trampl'd on by a Government of a different Per&s;ua&s;ion: Where|as
had an Univer&s;al and Ab&s;olute Toleration been e&s;tabli&s;h'd, the
Church had e&s;cap'd a Per&s;ecution that en&s;u'd. So that upon the whole,
Oppre&s;&s;ion and Per&s;ecution are not only again&s;t <HI>Natural Equity,</HI> and the
<HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> of the Author of <HI>the Chri&s;tian Religion:</HI> Nor is
Per&s;ecution in particular only altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>fir&s;t
Principles of the Reformation;</HI> but both Per&s;ecution and Oppre&s;&s;ion are
again&s;t the <HI>true Intere&s;t of all Communitys,</HI> and of <HI>every</HI> Man, and of
every <HI>Set of Men</HI> in 'em.</P>
<P>And that Oppre&s;&s;ion and Per&s;ecution are <HI>generally thought to be &s;o,</HI>
appears from hence; that in the great Conte&s;t that is on foot at pre|&s;ent
both Abroad and at Home, the &s;everal contending Powers and
Partys either really aim at the re&s;toring and &s;ecuring Liberty, or at
lea&s;t pretend to do &s;o; as well knowing, that no Number of Men
cou'd be brought to intere&s;t them&s;elves in their Quarrel on any o|ther
&s;core. Thus whil&s;t the Confederates are endeavouring to &s;e|cure
the Libertys of <HI>Europe,</HI> by di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> of
the Throne of <HI>Spain;</HI> and to re&s;tore the Rights of <HI>Spain,</HI> by placing
a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> in it; the King of <HI>France</HI> pretends
to have only pur&s;u'd a Will made in the favour of his Grand&s;on in
&s;eizing on that Monarchy, and to have prevented the Injury that
wou'd have accru'd to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by di&s;membring it. And whil&s;t
&s;ome of the Northern Powers don't think the Reform'd Religion &s;e|cure,
till the exorbitant Power of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> is reduc'd;
The Roman Catholicks indu&s;triou&s;ly give it out every where, that
the Succe&s;s of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> portends Ruin to their Church;
becau&s;e that Hou&s;e is in &s;o &s;trict a League with Hereticks: And endea|vour
to frighten the poor bigotted People with the Stakes and Gibbets,
the Plots and Con&s;piracys, the Croi&s;adocs and Inqui&s;itions, and all tho&s;e
other Tragical Engines of Blood and Violence, which they have never
&s;uffer'd Hereticks to be unacquainted with, whenever their Power has
been equal to their implacable Malice and ill Will. And thus at Home,
whil&s;t the Low Church have protected the Di&s;&s;enters from the Per&s;e|cution
of the High Church, in order to maintain their own Liberty as well
as that of the Di&s;&s;enters; and have been enabled &s;ince by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the Di&s;&s;enters to ward off a Per&s;ecution again&s;t them&s;elves, which
it had been afterwards in the power of the High Church to have
commenc'd again&s;t them, when they had &s;o pleas'd; the High Church
<PB N="6" REF="5">
have endeavour'd to &s;ugge&s;t and in&s;inuate in all Parts of the King|dom,
that the Church is in Danger, and that they &s;han't have the Li|berty
of being High Churchmen any longer, from too &s;trict a Cor|re&s;pondence,
that they ob&s;erve, it &s;eems, between the Low Church
and Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>And no wonder there is &s;uch a &s;truggle for Liberty in reality
or pretence in all Parts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> &s;ince every Man that is
&s;en&s;ible of the ine&s;timable value of Liberty, is at the &s;ame time &s;en|&s;ible,
that it can receive no hurt in any Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> without en|dangering
it in all others. For Per&s;ecution and Slavery, like a Fire,
wa&s;te and de&s;troy as long as there is any thing left for them to prey
upon. Nor is there any Security again&s;t them, but the checking
them at their fir&s;t Appearing; &s;ince if they be &s;uffer'd to &s;pread, no
body can &s;ay where they will &s;top. Nor does any body in the Ca&s;e
of Fire (nor &s;hou'd they in the other Ca&s;es) tru&s;t to his di&s;tance
from it, at its fir&s;t Beginning; but in&s;tead of plea&s;ing him&s;elf with
the deluding Hopes that it will go out of it &s;elf, places all his Confi|dence
and Security in this, that every one takes it for a common E|nemy,
and thinks him&s;elf oblig'd, for his own &s;ake, to lend the be&s;t.
A&s;&s;i&s;tance he can to quench it. I hope therefore no body, who has
the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions of the Value and <HI>tender Nature of Liberty,</HI> will
be angry with me, that I am giving the be&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance I can, to ex|tingui&s;h
a Flame, that is broke out in one of the remote&s;t Parts of her
Maje&s;ty's Dominions. For tho it began here at Home, yet as it has
been often ob&s;erv'd to happen in great Fires, it has catch'd in di&s;|continuous
Buildings, and has &s;pread &s;till further and further, till it
has at la&s;t reach'd &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts of the World. An
Attempt was but made to di&s;able Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters from bearing
any Office in <HI>England,</HI> and pre&s;ently they were excluded from them
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from Sitting in the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly in
<HI>Carolina.</HI> So that &s;ince it appears in Fact, as well as in Rea&s;on, that
no Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dominions is out of Danger, by its di&s;tance
from the Place where this Fire fir&s;t appear'd; nor &s;ecure, becau&s;e it
&s;eem'd but a &s;mall one ju&s;t kindled: I promi&s;e my &s;elf that it will
be taken kindly that I give my helping Hand to the putting it out in
any Place where it yet remains. And that it will not be ill taken, if
the Water, and Buckets, and other Engines be not in my Cu&s;tody;
nor tho&s;e that are to manage 'em under my Direction, and nothing
more be in my Power; if I only give the Notice, and cry Fire, in
order to bring others to my Aid, and to di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e who have the
more particular Care of the&s;e Matters, to apply them&s;elves, by all
proper Methods, to &s;top its &s;preading any further.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
But I know it will be ju&s;tly expected that I &s;hou'd &s;atisfy every Bo|dy
that I don't give a fal&s;e Alarm. That I may not therefore be
wanting in this Point, I will here tran&s;cribe &s;ome part of an Act
made in the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Carolina</HI> in the year 1704. intitul'd, <HI>An
Act for the more effectual Pre&s;ervation of the Government of this Pro|vince,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N^o 6.</NOTE>
&amp;c. referring the Reader to the Act it &s;elf hereunto annex'd,
for his further Satisfaction. Part of that Act runs thus: <HI>Be it there|fore
enacted by and with the Authority,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That every Per&s;on after the Ra|tification
of this Act, that &s;hall be cho&s;en a Member of the Commons Hou&s;e
of A&s;&s;embly, that hath not, within the &s;pace of 12 months before &s;uch his Elec|tion,
receiv'd the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and
V&s;age of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>as e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law; &s;uch per&s;on after his
Election, and before he be permitted to &s;it and vote in the &s;aid Hou&s;e, &s;hall
receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and
V&s;age of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>in &s;ome publick Church, upon &s;ome
Lord's Day, commonly call'd Sunday, immediately after Divine Service and
Sermon; and every of the &s;aid Per&s;ons, in open A&s;&s;embly, in a full Hou&s;e
duly &s;itting, with their Speaker in his Chair, &s;hall deliver a Certificate of
&s;uch his receiving the &s;aid Sacrament, as afore&s;aid, under the Hand of the
re&s;pective Mini&s;ter, or &s;hall make Proof of the Truth thereof by two credible
Witne&s;&s;es at the lea&s;t upon Oath.</HI> By which it plainly appears, that pro|te&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enters are by this Act <HI>rendred incapable of &s;itting in the Com|mons
Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly;</HI> and con&s;equently, that they are depriv'd
of a Capacity which the Law had given them, and which there|fore
was as much <HI>theirs,</HI> as any other thing they laid claim to: Since
'tis the Law alone in Civil Governments that makes this thing Mine,
and that thing another Man's. Nor is it of an in&s;ignificant thing
that they are depriv'd by this Law neither: For as Legal Capacitys in
every Country are the Foundations of all the Happine&s;s a Man can have
in that Country; &s;o the Capacity this Act deprives them of, is one of
the highe&s;t a Man can have in that Country, either in re&s;pect of <HI>V&s;e|fulne&s;s</HI>
or <HI>Honour:</HI> And a Capacity, to which they had as <HI>good a Title,</HI>
as to a Capacity of holding or devi&s;ing an E&s;tate, by Grant, Sale,
Deed of Gift or Te&s;tament, or of contracting any Relation in Life,
or of holding or executing any Place or Office, or of having any Ti|tle,
or Mark of Di&s;tinction and Honour.</P>
<P>And as the Capacity to &s;it in the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly is
not only a Capacity of the greate&s;t Power, but of the greate&s;t Di&s;|tinction
and Honour; &s;o the taking it away is a Note of great <HI>Infa|my</HI>
and Di&s;grace, for it's &s;ingling 'em out as Knaves and Ra&s;cals, who
are not fit to be intru&s;ted with the Libertys of the People in the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
&s;ame degree that other Men are; and 'tis but giving them an ill
Name, and the Mob will not fail to treat 'em accordingly. This
I mention the rather, becau&s;e I find by <HI>a Repre&s;entation of &s;everal Grie|vances
in</HI> Carolina, <HI>&s;ign'd by &s;everal of the Members of the Commons
Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, and other principal Inhabitants, to the Lords Proprie|tors,
dated the 26th of</HI> June, 1703. that tho&s;e who had then (and
who have &s;till) the chief Power of that Province in their Hands,
are very well acquainted with &s;uch tumultuous Manners of Proceed|ings,
as may be more particularly &s;een in the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th,
14th, 15th and 16th Articles of the &s;aid Repre&s;entation, a Copy
whereof is hereunto annex'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">N^o 5.</NOTE>. By which Articles it plainly ap|pears,
that after the prevailing Party in the A&s;&s;embly had abus'd
and $evil'd &s;ome worthy Members of that A&s;&s;embly, and treated
them with the mo&s;t reflecting Language imaginable, only for in|&s;i&s;ting
upon &s;ome things that were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;erving
the Dignity of that Hou&s;e, and the Freedom of their Elec|tions;
the Mob was rais'd upon 'em, and incourag'd to in&s;ult 'em for
four or five days in a very riotous manner, to their great Damage,
and the manife&s;t Danger of their Lives. During which time, the
Governme$t was &s;o far from quelling the Riot, or puni&s;hing the Ri|oters;
that as all Methods were taken to rai&s;e, countenance and incou|rage
it whil&s;t it la&s;ted<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE>; &s;o, like Methods have been us'd to skreen the
Rioters and their Abettors from Ju&s;tice ever &s;ince. In order whereto
the principal Promoters of this Riot have been put into the chief
Places of the Law. And I &s;uppo&s;e no body will find it difficult to
beleive, that the&s;e riotous, tumultuous and in&s;olent Proceedings have
been very grievous and frequent &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing this Act as well as
before. And as the&s;e In&s;olences mu&s;t be born patiently by the Pro|te&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enters, and without any hopes of Redre&s;s, if they con|tinue
there; &s;o they can't quit the Place, if the&s;e In&s;olences become
in&s;upportable, without &s;u&s;taining great <HI>Damage</HI> in their E&s;tates, and
expo&s;ing them&s;elves to manife&s;t <HI>Dangers</HI> and Inconveniences in tran&s;|porting
their Familys and Effects. So that upon the whole, this Act
will appear not only to deprive the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters of &s;ome|thing
that was theirs, but to deprive 'em of a <HI>Capacity</HI> of <HI>Honour</HI> as
well as <HI>Power,</HI> and to brand 'em with a Mark of great <HI>Infamy</HI> and Re|proach;
and at the &s;ame time either to expo&s;e 'em to the <HI>In&s;olences</HI>
that u&s;ually accompany &s;uch a Character, if they &s;hou'd have Hardi|ne&s;s
enough to &s;tay in the Province, or, which is wor&s;e, to the
great <HI>Damage</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI> of their <HI>E&s;tates</HI> and <HI>Familys</HI> if they can't.</P>
<P>Now the making Men unea&s;y for the &s;ake of any Opinion that they
hold in Matters of Religion, which does not di&s;turb the Publick
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Peace, is <HI>Per&s;ecution:</HI> Whether they are made unea&s;y by inflicting
any Corporal or Pecuniary Puni&s;hment, or by depriving them of any
Privilege; and whether that Privilege be Power, Honour, or Repu|tation,
it makes no difference. For &s;till every thing that makes a
Man unea&s;y is Puni&s;hment; and the inflicting that Puni&s;hment for
Con&s;cience-&s;ake, makes it Per&s;ecution. And what can it be then
but a &s;evere Per&s;ecution, to rob Men of a Capacity for the &s;ake of
their Con&s;cience, by which they can be of the mo&s;t publick U&s;e and
Service? U&s;efulne&s;s being the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure, and ju&s;tly deem'd
by all good Men the true&s;t and noble&s;t End of Life; in which Men
come neare&s;t to the Character of our B. Saviour, who went about doing
good; and even to that of our great Creator, who&s;e Goodne&s;s is over
all his Works. And &s;ince Marks of Honour and high Tru&s;ts are Re|wards
of Merit and Greatne&s;s, What can the taking away the very Ca|pacity
of 'em be, but Puni&s;hments? And what can Puni&s;hments be but
Per&s;ecution, if inflicted for Con&s;cience-&s;ake? And if the bare tak|ing
away a Mark of Honour, and advantageous Di&s;tinction for Con|&s;cience-&s;ake,
mu&s;t be deem'd a Per&s;ecution, 'tis certain, that it mu&s;t be
as great an Aggravation and Enhancement of that Per&s;ecution, to
brand Men with a Mark of Di&s;tinction to their di&s;advantage, and ex|po&s;e
them as Men not fit to be tru&s;ted in publick Concerns; as if every
Di&s;&s;enter there was to &s;tand upon a Stage, or in their Courts of
Ju&s;tice, with a Paper upon his Brea&s;t, notifying him to be a Prote|&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enter, and therefore to be &s;hunned and avoided as a Be|trayer
of the highe&s;t Tru&s;ts of the Province. The In&s;olences which
may follow &s;uch a Character as this, may oblige the Di&s;&s;enters to quit
the Province, to the very great Lo&s;s and Damage of their E&s;tates:
And in that Ca&s;e, this Exclu&s;ion will amount, not only to a heavy
Fine, but to Bani&s;hment it &s;elf; and perhaps to Mutilation, and lo&s;s
of Life or Limb, before they get out of the Country.</P>
<P>This is the Per&s;ecution this Act expo&s;es Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters to at
pre&s;ent. But what Per&s;ecution can they <HI>be &s;ecure again&s;t for the fu|ture,</HI>
upon the Principles on which this Act is founded? Nay, what
per&s;ecuting Bills mayn't they, who are thought to have ju&s;tly de|&s;erv'd
this Treatment, apprehend from a Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;em|bly,
compos'd of almo&s;t none but &s;uch as thought they de&s;erv'd it?
For if the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly have a Right to bring in a
Bill, to deprive Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters of the Capacity of &s;itting in
that Hou&s;e; mayn't they bring others to deprive 'em of any other Ca|pacity
of Honour that they now hold? And if they can bring in a
Bill to puni&s;h 'em with this Mark of Di&s;grace, can't they bring in a
Bill or Bills to puni&s;h 'em with any greater? If they can call 'em
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Rogues and Ra&s;cals by Implication, can't they call 'em &s;o in terms at
length when they plea&s;e? And mayn't they then treat them as &s;uch;
and bring in a Bill to Pillory or Cart 'em, or burn 'em in the Cheek; or
put any the mo&s;t publick Badge of Infamy upon 'em that they think
fit? For when they once come to be thought Rogues and Ra&s;cals, Di|&s;turbers
of the Publick Peace; it's then intirely in the Brea&s;t of the
Hou&s;e to bring in a Bill or Bills, in order to inflict &s;uch further Pu|ni&s;hments,
and to take &s;uch other Precautions again&s;t them as the
Exigency of the Ca&s;e, that is, according as the Security of the Pub|lick
&s;hall require.</P>
<P>Nay, and will not the Publick Security <HI>require</HI> that <HI>more</HI> &s;hould be
done? For if Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Carolina</HI> are not fit to re|main
capable of the Legi&s;lative Power, it can't be thought &s;afe to let
them remain capable of any part of the Executive Power. And when
they are not capable of Repre&s;enting, it can never be thought &s;afe to
let 'em remain capable of being Repre&s;ented. For if they &s;hould be
intru&s;ted with the Power of Electing, they may elect Men, that may
re&s;tore them to all the Capacities, of which for the Publick Safety they
have been depriv'd: And if they &s;hould not be capable of Electing,
it can't be thought prudent to let 'em enjoy the Property which enti|tles
others to that Right. For Power will follow Property, and if
they are &s;uffer'd to hold their Property, they may regain their
Power: And when their Lands &s;hall be confi&s;cated, 'twill not be &s;afe
to &s;uffer a parcel of exa&s;perated and de&s;perate Men to remain in the
Country; and &s;o they mu&s;t either bani&s;h 'em, or &s;end 'em to the
Gallows: Or if common Compa&s;&s;ion and Humanity &s;hould &s;o far
prevail again&s;t con&s;i&s;tency with the&s;e Principles, as to let this pre&s;ent
Set of Di&s;&s;enters live out the time that Nature has allotted 'em, they
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily forbid 'em to Marry, or oblige 'em to Ca&s;tration;
that a Race of &s;uch Mon&s;ters may no longer be continued to the dan|ger
and di&s;turbance of the Publick Peace. And if Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters
may be expo&s;ed, made incapable of all Offices, of Electing, or
being Elected to the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly; if they may be con|$fi&s;cated
and pro&s;cribed, and that the fir&s;t of the&s;e Steps, after it is once
taken, does naturally, and in good Policy ought to lead Men on to
all the others; the Di&s;&s;enters have but a &s;lender Security, that &s;uch
Mea&s;ures &s;hall not be taken from the Temper of tho&s;e Men, who by
virtue of this Act mu&s;t compo&s;e the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly. And
this Bill having pa&s;t the Deputies of the Proprietors, who (as
things &s;tand now in <HI>Carolina</HI>) compo&s;e the Upper Hou&s;e, and the
Proprietors them&s;elves having Ratify'd it; the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;en|ters
can have no Security, that they will not pa&s;s and ratify
<PB N="11" REF="10">
any of the other, when they &s;hall come to be offer'd to 'em.
And let no body think the&s;e Inferences to be Vi&s;ionary and Chime|rical,
and the mere Gue&s;&s;es and Conjectures of a Splenetick Man:
Let them that think &s;o, &s;hew me a Country where Per&s;ecutors have
ever &s;topt of them&s;elves, after they have once got Power into
their hands; and being contented with their fir&s;t Beginnings, have
made no further progre&s;s: Or that they have not proceeded from one
degree of Violence to another, till they arriv'd at long run at the
la&s;t; if they have not been prevented by &s;ome publick Calamity,
Di&s;tre&s;s or Exigency, that has made them think it un&s;afe for them|&s;elves
to carry their Violences to that degree. So that it has been a
common Ob&s;ervation, that Per&s;ecution never &s;tops till it comes to
Fire and Faggot, and only &s;tops there becau&s;e it can go no fur|ther.</P>
<P>Upon
which account, as well as many others, it is an Oppre&s;&s;ion
in it &s;elf &s;o odious, and &s;o generally thought to be &s;o; that after that
is fully prov'd upon any Law, there needs nothing more to be &s;aid
again&s;t it: For that it &s;elf is &s;aying, That it is again&s;t <HI>Natural Equity,</HI>
the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t Principles of the Reformation,</HI> and the
<HI>true Intere&s;t</HI> of every Community. I &s;han't therefore go about to
prove this Law to de&s;erve the&s;e general Characters, but only give
tho&s;e ill Characters of this Law, which are peculiar to it &s;elf; and
prove particularly, that it is a great In&s;tance of Ingratitude to the
Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, that it is Ruinous and De&s;tructive to the Pro|vince,
and a Breach of the Original Contract between the Proprietors
and the People that inhabit it.</P>
<P>'Tis in the fir&s;t place a mo&s;t <HI>unju&s;t Return</HI> to the Di&s;&s;enters, for
their quiet, impartial and obliging Behaviour to their Neighbours,
and for their kind and re&s;pectful Deportment to the Church of <HI>Eng|land.</HI>
So far were they from undermining the Church, or attempting
any thing again&s;t it, that they contributed voluntarily to the Main|tenance
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Mini&s;ter in <HI>Gharles-Town,</HI> the Ca|pital
of this Province, the only Church of <HI>England</HI> Mini&s;ter that
there was at that time in the Province, before there was any publick
Maintenance &s;ettled on him. And about the Year 1698. Mr. <HI>Blake</HI> a
Di&s;&s;enting Governour, thinking the Maintenance of the Mini&s;ter too
precarious, procur'd an Act of A&s;&s;embly (in which there were a
great number of Di&s;&s;enters) for the &s;ettling a very convenient Hou&s;e,
with a Glebe, two Servants, and 150 <HI>i. per Ann.</HI> upon the Mini&s;ter
of that Church for ever. And after the &s;aid Act had pa&s;s'd through
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the two Hou&s;es by his Influence, he gave the A&s;&s;ent to it: The Go|vernor
in <HI>Carolina</HI> having a Negative upon all Bills, after they have
pa&s;t thro both Hou&s;es. And as he made &s;everal con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents
to him; &s;o his Lady, tho a Di&s;&s;enter as well as he, gave &s;ome things
for adorning the Pulpit. This was the wor&s;t Effect that the Church ever
felt, of the Di&s;&s;enters Power in <HI>Carolina.</HI> So far were they from re|pealing
any Laws in favour of the Church, when they had the Power
in their Hands; that they made the&s;e <HI>Contributions,</HI> and &s;ettl'd this
<HI>Endowment</HI> upon the Church of <HI>Charles</HI> Town by Law, tho they were
under no Obligations to do &s;o; but &s;uch as aro&s;e from the deference
they had to the Government of <HI>England,</HI> and a grateful Sen&s;e both of
the Liberty it had granted to 'em, and of a Genero&s;ity &s;omewhat akin
to this, which the Churchmen had &s;hewn in their Regard. And as
they were under no other Obligations, &s;o they had no apparent
Intere&s;t that could induce them to the one or the other, be&s;ides that
which &s;hould induce Men to all hand&s;om and generous Actions. It
might perhaps indeed be imagin'd at this di&s;tance, that this was
done to court Popularity with the Churchmen, in order to get them|&s;elves
elected for the future. But no Body can imagine this but a
perfect Stranger to the Province, for 'tis notorious that above two
Thirds of the People of <HI>Carolina</HI> are Di&s;&s;enters. So that nothing
&s;eems to have engag'd them to this Chri&s;tian Behaviour, but a truly
Chri&s;tian Spirit; which appears from the liberal Maintenance that
they &s;ettl'd upon the Mini&s;ter, as well as from the Principles, which
in all probability engag'd them to &s;ettle it. The&s;e are the generous
Di&s;po&s;itions, which an Univer&s;al and Ab&s;olute Toleration permitted
Humanity and the Chri&s;tian Religion to in&s;pire Men withal in <HI>Caro|lina:</HI>
And which it would by a Parity of Rea&s;on produce every where
el&s;e. For by this In&s;tance it is plain that it is not the Differences in
Opinion between the Church and Di&s;&s;enters, that alienate the Minds
of the one from the other; and 'tis as plain that it is only the In|juries
done to the Di&s;&s;enters upon account of the&s;e Differences, that
do. But when Men once feel any Power oppre&s;&s;ive and injurious,
'tis no Wonder if they then endeavour to le&s;&s;en it.</P>
<P>But &s;o far has the want of Provocations been able to work <HI>the&s;e</HI>
Di&s;po&s;itions in another &s;et of Men in <HI>Carolina,</HI> who would fain be
thought the only Churchmen there, that even the&s;e &s;ingular and un|con&s;train'd
Kindne&s;&s;es and Benefactions of the Di&s;&s;enters to the
Churchmen have not been able to do it; but have only tended to
give them the <HI>Hardine&s;s,</HI> as the impartial Behaviour of the Di&s;&s;enters
has, to the continuing to them the <HI>Power to make this di&s;qualifying Law.</HI>
A Law which hereby manife&s;tly appears to be a returning of Evil for
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Good, in&s;tead of what good Laws, as well as good Actions, &s;hould be
a returning of Good for Evil. What can &s;uch Ingratitude as this do,
but make tho&s;e that are guilty of it appear to be void of all Principles
of Humanity and the Chri&s;tian Religion, and render them odious both
to God and Man? And if the Men that have made this Act &s;hould
pa&s;s for good Churchmen, and be thought and &s;aid to have done it
for the Service of the Church, and &s;hould be &s;upported and counte|nanc'd
in it, by Men that a&s;&s;ume and appropriate that Character to
them&s;elves; what can all this tend to, but to render the Church as
odious as they are? For a Church that teaches and abets Ingrati|tude,
may pa&s;s for any Church rather than a Chri&s;tian one. And
&s;ince nothing is more apt to provoke Men than Injurys, heighten'd
by Ingratitude, what can in any likelihood keep Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters
ea&s;y there, unle&s;s they &s;hou'd take them&s;elves to be the Tribe, which,
according to the Patriarch's Prediction, was to be a &s;trong A&s;s,
couching under his Burden; and &s;o &s;hou'd think them&s;elves oblig'd not
to endeavour to fling off their Burden, in order to fulfil the Prophecy?</P>
<P>And indeed <HI>Carolina</HI> is not the only Part of her Maje&s;ty's Domi|nions,
where the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters have &s;eem'd to act upon this
Per&s;ua&s;ion, and to have born the weight of the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion,
without &s;haring the better part of its peculiar Advantages.
They have been forc'd both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to yield them&s;elves
a perpetual Sacrifice to their Per&s;ecutors, rather than to take Liber|ty
in common with the Papi&s;ts, to the Ruin of the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion,
and our Civil Libertys. They have expos'd them&s;elves as far,
to procure Exclu&s;ions, Revolutions, and &s;uch like Securitys for our
Religion and Libertys, as any other Set of Men what&s;oever: But
when any &s;uch Securitys have been obtain'd, they &s;till, like the A&s;s,
have born the Burden of the Taxes, of Loans, and any thing el&s;e,
for the Support of the Government; tho they have been &s;o far from
u&s;ually having had any of the fine Trappings, that other Animals,
which are often more for Show than Service, have been adorn'd with;
that they have not yet obtain'd any Security in <HI>Ireland</HI> again&s;t the
heavy Load of former Per&s;ecutions, and have obtain'd no &s;uch Secu|rity
in <HI>England,</HI> as can prevent their Enemys riding them in &s;everal
Parts of the Kingdom. And this I &s;ay, that the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;en|ters
in <HI>Carolina</HI> may have this Con&s;olation, &s;uch as it is, till they
can obtain a better, That they are not the only Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters,
who don't meet with their Rewards in this World, and are to wait
for them with Patience in another.</P>
<P>And indeed the Chri&s;tian Religion will oblige them to wait with
Patience: But yet the Ingratitude of tho&s;e in <HI>Carolina,</HI> that make it
<PB N="14" REF="13">
nece&s;&s;ary for them to do &s;o, can never be thought any thing by con|&s;idering
Men, but the height of Imprudence and Folly. For it is do|ing
all they can to make their Friends and Benefactors turn their
greate&s;t Enemys, and to make them more their Enemys, who are &s;o
at pre&s;ent. And this particular Ingratitude of a Set of Men in <HI>Ca|rolina,</HI>
who arrogate to them&s;elves the name of Churchmen, is the
greate&s;t Provocation that can be given to the Di&s;&s;enters, to <HI>repent</HI> of
the kind and hand&s;om U&s;age they have always given them there;
and to teach the Di&s;&s;enters, whenever they have it in their Power
again, to <HI>u&s;e</HI> them hardly, and <HI>keep them under;</HI> &s;ince they are not to
be won by &s;uch In&s;tances of unexampl'd Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity.
The unfore&s;een Changes and Alterations to which all Governments
are &s;ubject, ought to teach all Partys Moderation, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e
who are in Power; but the Government of <HI>Carolina</HI> altering nece&s;|&s;arily
with its Proprietors, and its Proprietor&s;hips &s;hifting daily from
one Owner to another, and being thereby liable to more frequent and
&s;udden Alterations than almo&s;t any free Government in the World
be&s;ides, makes Heat and Violence in any Set of Men in Power there,
a greater Pre&s;umption and Madne&s;s than in any other: For it is giv|ing
an ill Precedent, that every one ea&s;ily fore&s;ees, by &s;elling a Pro|prietor&s;hip
to day, may turn again&s;t them&s;elves to morrow. And that
which makes Violence in the&s;e Men yet the more frantick and unac|countable,
is, that perhaps the very Title of the Proprietors, and
con&s;equently all the Title which this Set of Men have to Power (they
deriving all their Power from the&s;e Proprietors) may appear to have
a great many more Flaws than one, when it comes to be look'd into.
And &s;uch Violence and Ingratitude as this, may put Per&s;ons upon &s;uch
an Examination of their Title for the good of the Publick, as per|haps
they wou'd not have undertaken barely for their own private
Advantage.</P>
<P>But tho all Ingratitude be Folly and again&s;t our true Intere&s;t, yet
the Folly of all tho&s;e, whether Proprietors or Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina,</HI>
who have had any hand in pa&s;&s;ing this Law; and the Manner in which
they have acted incon&s;i&s;tently with their own <HI>true Intere&s;t</HI> and Advan|tage,
is abundantly more obvious and complicated, than an Act
of mere Ingratitude can be. 'Tis a known Maxim, that all In|fringements
upon Liberty, and particularly upon Liberty of
Con&s;cience, the mo&s;t valuable, and perhaps the only indefea&s;ible
Branch of Liberty, tend to <HI>&s;$acken Indu&s;try,</HI> to <HI>hinder Propagation</HI> and
Increa&s;e, to <HI>prevent</HI> Men from coming to <HI>&s;ettle</HI> in tho&s;e parts of the
<PB N="15" REF="14">
World which are the mo&s;t inviting, and to <HI>drive</HI> tho&s;e who are al|ready
fix'd and &s;ettled there, to &s;eek new Habitations in the very
Sinks of the Univer&s;e, where they may but enjoy this de&s;ir'd Liber|ty.
We have a clear and undeniable In&s;tance of this in <HI>Greece,</HI> where
there are not now, under the ab&s;olute Government of the Great
Turk, according to a mode&s;t Computation, the one hundredth part of
the Inhabitants, that there were when they were free Governments:
And by this means that Country is perfectly over-run with Briars
and Thorns; and an inexpre&s;&s;ible face of Barrenne&s;s, Poverty
and Want, covers all that Territory, which was once ju&s;tly re|nown'd
for the greate&s;t Fruitfulne&s;s, Trade and Riches of the
World. And the Mi&s;ery which the <HI>late</HI> Per&s;ecution has produc'd in
the Country, and in the Towns and Villages of <HI>France,</HI> in &s;o &s;hort a
Time, is a very convincing Proof, that all Violations of Liberty of
Con&s;cience will produce the &s;ame fatal Effects, as violating the Civil.
Rights of Mankind. And on the contrary, <HI>Holland,</HI> a perfect Bog,
fit for nothing but what it was, the Habitation of a few poor Fi&s;her|men,
is, by the great regard it has to the maintaining Liberty, and
particularly Liberty of Con&s;cience, become the very Garden of this
part of the World.</P>
<P>But that we may not talk of Places at a di&s;tance only, Have not
the Per&s;ecutions that have been &s;et on foot here at <HI>home,</HI> by Prote|&s;tants
again&s;t Prote&s;tants, ever &s;ince the Reformation, driven an infi|nite
number of People from our happy Climate, from their Habita|tions,
Friends, Relations, and Chri&s;tian Acquaintance, to run the
hazards of tran&s;porting them&s;elves, with their Families and Effects,
to very remote Parts of the World, either wholly uncultivated and
uninhabited, or where there were none but a wild ignorant and &s;a|vage
People, who had nothing but this to recommend them, that
they were by far preferable to their Oppre&s;&s;ors?</P>
<P>If then Per&s;ecution can drive Men from the be&s;t Countrys,
and depopulate the mo&s;t healthful Climates, the mo&s;t fertile
Soils, and the mo&s;t cultivated Regions; will it not ea&s;ily de|populate
a <HI>Country which has not the&s;e Advantages?</HI> The ve|ry
Rea&s;ons which drove Men from hence to <HI>Carolina,</HI> or which
tempted them to &s;tay there, are now <HI>cea&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>drive</HI> Men from
thence into other parts of the World. Liberty of Con&s;cience, the
Pearl of great Price, that the Di&s;&s;enting Inhabitants have &s;old all they
had to purcha&s;e, they are now depriv'd of; and the very Property
that po&s;&s;ibly others of ba&s;er Minds might go to &s;eek, they have now
no great rea&s;on to think them&s;elves &s;ecure of neither: Nay, the ve|ry
Reproach which they perhaps avoided here, when they for &s;ook
<PB N="16" REF="15">
their native Country, has overtaken them there, where they are
now counted as the Off-&s;couring of all things. Whil&s;t, God be
prais'd, the Liberty that had left our happy I&s;land, and was bani&s;h'd
to the&s;e remote Parts of the Engli&s;h Dominions, has vi&s;ited it again;
and &s;eems now likely to continue and fix among&s;t us. So that the
Birth and De&s;truction of this Province, will in all probability be
owing to the &s;ame Cau&s;e: For there are now great Numbers of the
principal Inhabitants, who have re&s;olv'd to tran&s;plant them&s;elves
into other Parts, as &s;oon as they &s;hall &s;ee that there is no Redre&s;s a|gain&s;t
this Act to be obtain'd.</P>
<P>But perhaps the People of <HI>Carolina</HI> are in the Ca&s;e of the Antient
<HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> or at lea&s;t of the pre&s;ent <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> and have more
Inhabitants than that barren Country can maintain: And that there|fore
they were oblig'd to make this Law to <HI>thin it,</HI> and drive &s;ome of
them away. This wou'd be thought a &s;evere Sarca&s;m if it were &s;aid
in <HI>Carolina,</HI> or to any that knows that Province; there being not
above a Thou&s;and Souls to inhabit a mo&s;t fruitful Country of Three
hundred Miles in length, and no Man can tell how many in breadth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Charter <HI>p.</HI> 1. as al&s;o the 2d Charter.</NOTE>
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second having granted the Proprietors all the Land
We&s;tward in a direct Line, between 31 and 36 degrees of Nor|thern
Latitude to the South Seas. Therefore this is &s;aid only to give
tho&s;e a true Notion of this Law, who are perfect Strangers to the
Place.</P>
<P>But then po&s;&s;ibly it will be imagin'd, that this Act affects but a
few of the Inhabitants of this Province, and tho&s;e the Mean, the
Lazy, and the Vicious; and that therefore it is but &s;acrificing a <HI>&s;mall
Number of unworthy</HI> Men to the Peace and Quiet of a Country:
Or that it is but letting out a little ill Blood, which is readily to be
parted with for the Health and Vigor of the Body Politick, tho per|haps
it may not abound with too great Quantity of that which is of a
ju&s;t Temperament. Something like this at lea&s;t was pretended and
alledged again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> when Per&s;ecution drove
them from hence to tho&s;e parts of the World: But this is &s;o far
from being the true Rea&s;on of pa&s;&s;ing this Act, that the Facts them|&s;elves
are notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; as indeed they were in re&s;pect of tho&s;e
whom the Penal Laws drove from hence. But yet with this diffe|rence,
that this Pretext, according to the Prejudices that were ge|nearlly
entertain'd again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters here, carried &s;ome Face and
Plau&s;ibility along with it; whil&s;t there is not the lea&s;t colour for
the&s;e Allegations there: The Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters being above two
Thirds of the Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina,</HI> as well as the mo&s;t &s;ober, or|derly,
and the riche&s;t, that is, the mo&s;t Landed and Trading Men in
<PB N="17" REF="16">
the Province. Such a Character as this of the Di&s;&s;enters of that
Province, I am afraid won't be taken upon Tru&s;t, from the bare
A&s;&s;ertion of a Man that writes in their defence, and that in an Age
when no Accounts of Writers are much farther allow'd than they
produce Vouchers for; but e&s;pecially when they are in favour
of Di&s;&s;enters, where the lea&s;t Article is hardly to be taken upon
the be&s;t Credit. But I hope the Account which the Mini&s;ter of the
Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> formerly a Non-Juror, that has
re&s;ided there for &s;everal Years, gives of them, may be allow'd to be
a good Authority. He has this remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, in a Letter which
he writes to a Reverend Dean of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> Dr. <HI>St&mdash;nh&mdash;p,</HI>
a Copy whereof is hereunto annex'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">N$$. 12.</NOTE> &startq;<HI>And I a little favouring the
Di&s;&s;enters, who generally are the &s;$bere&s;t, mo&s;t numerous and riche&s;t
People of this Province; Some Men that are now in Power have for that
rea&s;on been my Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>And for who&s;e &s;ake, I pray, mu&s;t two Thirds of &s;uch Inhabitants
be driven away? Why truly if you will believe the &s;ame Authori|ty,
which I think in this Ca&s;e no body will di&s;pute, 'tis for the &s;ake of
a Set of the mo&s;t <HI>irreligious, flagitious, tyrannical Men</HI> in the whole Pro|vince;
who appropriate to them&s;elves the Name of <HI>Church men,</HI> tho
they &s;eldom or never go to Church them&s;elves, have never receiv'd
the Sacrament the&s;e five Years; and have little other Preten&s;ions to
this Title, than their unwearied Endeavours to prevent their &s;cru|pulous
and con&s;cientions Neighbours from going to wor&s;hip God any
where el&s;e. His Words are the&s;e in the &s;ame Letter, <HI>Our la&s;t A&s;&s;embly
being compo&s;ed of many Men of very loo&s;e and corrupt Morals,</HI> &amp;c. And in
his Petition to the Palatine and Proprietors of <HI>Carolina</HI> hercunto an|nex'd,
he tells them, <HI>That he is &s;orry to inform their Lord&s;hips,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N$$. 13.</NOTE> <HI>that mo&s;t of
the late Members of A&s;&s;embly, have been con&s;tant Ab&s;enters from the Holy
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; tho for the&s;e five Years pa&s;t he has ad|mini&s;tred
it in his Church at lea&s;t &s;ix times a Year: So that it is no wonder
they have in&s;erted an ab&s;urd Oath in a late Act, to be taken by Members

he &s;ays, <HI>That many of the Members of the Commons Hou&s;e that pa&s;t this

&s;ufficiently &s;ets forth their tyrannical Proceedings, of which we &s;hall
give a farther and a more particular account. And in his Ca&s;e

<HI>Men:</HI> So that according to the Account of this Clergy-man, this
Act will be &s;o far from letting out the ill Blood of <HI>Carolina,</HI> that it
will let out that good Blood, who&s;e Office it is in the Opinion of
&s;ome <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> to be the <HI>FraeEnum bilis,</HI> and to leave nothing but ill Hu|mours
to over-run the Body without controul. 'I will be to &s;ling
away the Salt of this Province, which is to be its Savor; and to give
up every thing there to Ta&s;tle&s;ne&s;s or Corruption.</P>
<P>But in order to give the true Character of this Set of Men,
there is no nece&s;&s;ity to quote any Works but their own. They
have drawn their Picture to the Life in this <HI>infamous Act,</HI> and in
&s;everal of their <HI>Proceedings</HI> that have pav'd the way to it. In
which we may plainly di&s;cover Irreligion and Oppre&s;&s;ion to be
the very Complexion and principal Lines of their Minds. But
in order to let the World &s;ee what were the Views that induc'd
this Faction to endeavour to obtain this Law, who&s;e tendency
to ruin the Province mu&s;t have been &s;o obvious to them, as to make
them &s;en&s;ible that they them&s;elves were at la&s;t to become Sharers in
the Calamity; it is nece&s;&s;ary to let the World know the State of
<HI>Carolina</HI> at the time of their b$inging in this Bill into the A&s;&s;embly.
And in order to give an Account of the State of this Province at that
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> we mu&s;t go as far back as the Year 1700. When upon the death
of Governour <HI>blake,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Moore</HI> procur'd him&s;elf to be elected
Governour in his room, by divers indirect and illegal Practices. This E|lection
is made by the Council, which is compos'd of the Proprietors
Deputys: And they are the Heads of that Faction from which all the
M$$erys of this Province chiefly proceed. They appear'd extreme|ly
follicitous to put Power into this Man's hands, in hopes no doubt
to have it given back into their own; that &s;o they might thereby have
an opportuaity to repair their broken Fortunes at the Expence of the
Publick. After they had by the&s;e Methods obtain'd a Governour,
who&s;e Debts and Nece&s;&s;ities were like to put him upon any violent
Mea&s;ures, that could turn to the private Advantage of the Faction:
$e in the fir&s;t place made all his Efforts to <HI>fill up</HI> a <HI>Council;</HI> and in the
next place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> which was in the Year 1701. to obtain &s;uch a <HI>Commons
Hou&s;e</HI> of A&s;&s;embly, as would be mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to his private
Views: Both of which he obtain'd accordingly, and the la&s;t by the
mo&s;t illegal Elections and Returns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$</NOTE> that perhaps a free Country ever
heard of. And to prevent a Redre&s;s of the&s;e undue Elections, he
<HI>arbitra$$ proragu'd</HI> the A&s;&s;embly &s;everal times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar$. 2.</NOTE> when the Commons
Hou&s;e were enqu$ring into the &s;aid Elections. And when the A&s;&s;em|bly
was to be &s;u&s;&s;erd to meet, in order to quiet the Clamours that
were among&s;t the People again&s;t &s;uch Arbitrary Proceedings, an
<PB N="19" REF="18">
illegal, expen&s;ive, and hazardous Expedition, was propos'd again&s;t
Fort St. <HI>Augu&s;tine;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 3.</NOTE> partly to enrich them&s;elves out of the Mony that
&s;hould be allowed for that Expedition, and out of the Booty that
&s;hould be taken;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 6.</NOTE> (tho, by Law, that ought to be divided among&s;t
the Soldiers) and partly to <HI>prevent</HI> an <HI>Enquiry</HI> into the&s;e undue Elec|tions.
And that no body might attempt or move the &s;ame Enquiry
again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 10.</NOTE> nor oppo&s;e the &s;aid Expedition, the A&s;&s;embly was deny'd the
<HI>Liberty of Free Debate.</HI> When it was propos'd in the Hou&s;e to con|firm
the Fundamental Con&s;titutions, which they knew would &s;ettle
the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 8.</NOTE> and prevent their Abu&s;es; they <HI>ridicul'd them as void
and ab&s;urd</HI> in them&s;elves, and not fit to be declar'd the Rule of the
Government: Tho it was by the&s;e very Con&s;titutions, that they $a$
the Power of a Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly. But it was nece&s;&s;ary
to keep the Province in this un&s;ettled condition, on purpo&s;e that they
might have the better Pretence to act or not to act, according to the
&s;aid Con&s;titutions, as it &s;hould be&s;t &s;uit with their private Intere&s;t.
And as the &s;aid Governour and Council had prevented any Parlia|mentary
Enquirys into Irregularitys, that had been committed in
pa&s;t Elections and Returns to Parliament; &s;o they <HI>rejected a Bill</HI> for
regulating Elections, and preventing the like Abu&s;es for the future
(which pa&s;&s;ed twice through the Commons Hou&s;e) without &s;o much
as a Conference.</P>
<P>And to terrify tho&s;e Members who &s;till &s;tood up in the Commons
Hou&s;e, for the Dignity of that Hou&s;e, and the Libertys of the Pro|vince,
a <HI>Riot</HI> was rais'd upon them by the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, the
Militia Officers, and other Agents of the Governor and Council, to
their great Damage and Danger, in manife&s;t Violation of the Liber|ty
of the Subject, and of the Privileges of Parliament. And one
of the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly was violently drag'd on board a
Ship, there unlawfully detain'd, and threatned to be hang'd or car|ry'd
to <HI>Jamaica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. $</NOTE> or left on &s;ome remote and de&s;olate I&s;land. As this
Riot was <HI>rais'd, encourag'd and countenan$'d</HI> by the &s;aid Governor and
Council, and as no A&s;i&s;tance cou'd be obtain'd to quell it; &s;o all
Methods to <HI>enquire</HI> into and <HI>puni&s;h</HI> the &s;ame have been render'd inef|fectual,
and the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice entirely &s;topt. For Sir $word$
<HI>John&s;on</HI> was made Governor in the room of the &s;aid Governor
<HI>Moore;</HI> the &s;aid Governor <HI>Moore</HI> was pre&s;ently made $word$ Ge|neral,
and Mr. $word$, another of the chief Abertors of the Riot,
the, Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, who in this Proviace is &s;ole
Judge. Sir <HI>Nath $word$ John&s;on</HI> was General of the <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands in
the Reign of the late King <HI>James;</HI> but he quitted his Government
upon the Revolution, and retir'd to <HI>Carolina,</HI> where he liv'd private|ly
<PB N="10" REF="19">
till the Death of the late King <HI>James:</HI> Upon which he fir&s;t took
the Oaths to the Government, and &s;ome time after was made Go|vernor
of the Province. And he has &s;ince his being Governor ap|pointed
&s;uch Sheriffs as prevent all Pro&s;ecutions of this Riot at their
A&s;&s;izes or Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions (which are the only Courts of Ju&s;tice in
this Province where Crimes of this Nature can be try'd, and where
the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Trott</HI> is &s;ole Judg) by returning &s;uch Jurors as were known
Abettors of the &s;aid Riot. So that there is a total failure of Ju&s;tice,
and nothing but Corruption in the whole Frame and Admini&s;tration
of Government.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;pirators however &s;aw that a new Parliament might &s;et
all things to rights again. And therefore when the time of a new
Election came,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fundamen|tal Con&s;it|utions, No. 2. &sect;. 73.</NOTE> which, according to their Con&s;titution, is once in
two years, they re&s;olv'd to procure a Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly
of the &s;ame Complexion with the former, and by more illegal Prac|tices,
if tho&s;e they had us'd in the former Elections wou'd not do
their Bu&s;ine&s;s. Their De&s;igns took effect, and &s;uch a Commons
Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly was return'd, as fully an&s;wer'd their Expectations.
But becau&s;e they &s;aw that the illegal Methods they had taken at the&s;e
two Elections, and that they &s;hou'd be fore'd to take in future Elections,
wou'd at length, when Men came to cool, &s;et the Minds of all the Peo|ple
again&s;t them; and that then a Parliament wou'd in all proba|bility
be cho&s;en that wou'd enquire into the&s;e Grievances, and take
effectual care to bring the Authors of them to condign Puni&s;hment;
therefore they now re&s;olv'd to carry on their Violences <HI>by Law,</HI> and
cover and &s;anctify them by that u&s;ual Pretext. Knowing therefore,
that tho&s;e who had been the mo&s;t active in endeavouring to prevent
the Ruin of the Con&s;titution, were Di&s;&s;enters; and that if they
cou'd once exclude them the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, they
&s;hou'd never be in Danger of being call'd to account, for $word$
thus the Con&s;titution of the Proviace in all its Paris, to their own
A varice and Ambition; becau&s;e there is not a &s;ufficient number of
moderate Churchmen in the Proviace, who are qualify'd by their la|tere&s;t
and Figure for being cho&s;en into the Commons Hou&s;e to out|vote
their Faction; they brough' in this Bill to exclude Prote&s;&s;$$$
Di&s;&s;enters from ever &s;itting in it for the future. The $word$ of $word$
Act is, <HI>An Act for the more effectual Pre&s;$$$tion $word$ the Government of
this Province, by requiring all Per&s;ons that $word$ after $span$ Mem|bers
of the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, and in to the $span$
and to conform to the Religious Wor&s;hip in this Province, according to the
Church of England, and to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's S$pper,
according to the Rites and U&s;age of the &s;aid Church.</HI> Whereas the $word$
<PB N="21" REF="20">
only obliges <HI>&s;ome</HI> Per&s;ons that &s;hall hereafter be cho&s;en Members of
the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, &s;o to conform, and &s;o to receive
the Sacrament. And whom does it &s;o oblige? Why tho&s;e who con|&s;cientiou&s;ly
receive the Sacrament, according to its In&s;titution, with
the Di&s;&s;enters; but &s;cruple to receive it, according to &s;ome Rites of
human Additions, in the Church; which are allow'd by the Church it
&s;elf to be indifferent, and &s;crupl'd by &s;ome of the&s;e Di&s;&s;enters as un|lawful.
And whom does it not oblige? Why tho&s;e who impiou&s;ly
refu&s;e to receive it any where, and to prepare and fit them&s;elves
rightly &s;o to do, according to our Saviour's po&s;itive Injunction and
Command. Which is to exclude &s;ome con&s;cientious Men out of the
Commons Hou&s;e, and to make an expre&s;s Provi&s;ion to keep in &s;everal
of tho&s;e, who re&s;olve to lead Lives, for which their own Con&s;cien|ces
reproach and condemn them. And this is the &s;en&s;e that the afore|&s;aid
Clergyman has of this Act, who tells the Palatine and Proprietors,
in the Petition above quoted, <HI>That be cannot think it will be much for the
Credit and Service of the Church of</HI> England <HI>there, that a Door &s;hou'd be &s;o
directly open'd, and &s;uch Provi&s;ion made for the mo&s;t Loo&s;e and Pro&s;tigate
Per&s;ons to &s;it and vote in the making their Laws, who will but take the
Oath appointed by the &s;aid Act.</HI></P>
<P>But to what <HI>Ab&s;urditys,</HI> to what <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tencys,</HI> to what <HI>Villany</HI> will
not Faction and Bigotry lead Men? Here is an Act, who&s;e Title and
enacting Part do in &s;uch explicite and po&s;itive Terms contradict and
overthrow each other, as leaves no room for the blinde&s;t Charity to
excu&s;e the Men who fram'd and pa&s;s'd it, from the mo&s;t de&s;ign'd
Cheat and Hypocri&s;y imaginable. Nor does the Title and Act com|par'd
together contain all its Illu&s;ions. For the very Preamble of the
Act it &s;elf is founded upon two manife&s;t Fal&s;hoods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the $span$</NOTE> <HI>That is hath &s;een
found by Experience,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that by the Laws and U&s;age of</HI> England,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and is every whit as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Body of the Act, as
the Title is. For it a&s;&s;erts that nothing is more incon&s;i&s;tent with the
Chri&s;tian Religion, and particularly with the Doctrine of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> than Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience only: And neverthele&s;s
enacts, That every body &s;hall be Per&s;ecuted who ab&s;tains from re|ceiving
the Sacrament, according to certain Rites of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> for Con&s;cience only. It a&s;&s;erts, That a Man may be$ $$|cere
Pro$e&s;&s;or of the Religion of the Chruch of <HI>England,</HI> and a $$|cere
Conformi&s;t to the &s;ame, who neither receives the Sacrament
with the Church, and who owns him&s;elf not rightly and &s;itly pre|$$
already to $word$ it, and yet does not profe&s;s any De&s;ign to
prepare him&s;elf any better for the time to come.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
Nor was this Bill fram'd to exclude Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters only the
Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, but <HI>all moderate Churchmen,</HI> and to fill
the Hou&s;e with Men of the mo&s;t high and violent Principles in the
Province. So much the Framers of this Act had it in their View to
&s;trengthen a mere Faction, that arrogate to them&s;elves the name of
Churchmen. For it takes all imaginable Care, that when by this
Act a Di&s;&s;enter &s;hall be turn'd out of the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;em|bly,
a Man of high and violent Principles may <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> &s;uceed
him. For they do not enact, that upon a Di&s;&s;enter's being turn'd out,
a new Writ &s;hall i&s;&s;ue, as in all Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice they ought to
have done, le&s;t the County that &s;ent a Di&s;&s;enter, &s;hou'd &s;end a
Churchman, who &s;hou'd prove as little to their prupo&s;e. But in|&s;tead
of ordering a new Writ to i&s;&s;ue, order contrary to the very
nature of a fair Repre&s;entation, that the Candidate, that had the
greate&s;t Number of Votes next to the Di&s;&s;enter, &s;hall be the Repre|&s;entative
of that County: Men of violent and per&s;ecuting Principles
being the Men that are u&s;ually Competitors with the Di&s;&s;enters at
&s;uch Elections.</P>
<P>And thus they have &s;ecur'd the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly to
their own Faction: And by &s;ecuring that, they have, as far as the
nature of their Proprietary Con&s;titution will permit, <HI>&s;ecur'd the Go|vernment</HI>
entirely in their own Hands; they having no upper Hou&s;e,
con&s;i&s;ting of an Hereditary Landed Nobility, as by both the fir&s;t and
la&s;t fundamental Con&s;titutions they ought to have. In&s;tead of which,
their upper Hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts only of the Deputys of the Proprietors,
who al&s;o compo&s;e the Council. By which means the Board of Pro|prietors
have the power of three E'&s;tates, as well as all the executive
Power of the Province; whereas by their fundamental Con&s;titutions
they ought to have but the Power of one. And thus the mo&s;t equal
and be&s;t balanc'd Government, that perhaps ever was in the World,
where the &s;everal Parts of the Governement were the true&s;t Checks
upon each other that con'd po&s;&s;ibly be devis'd, is dwindled into a
&s;ingle Faction &s;ubject to no Check or Controul.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee with what Views to the State this Act was pa&s;t. And in|deed
I &s;carce believe any body ever thought that this Act in <HI>Carolina,</HI>
or a Bill of a like Nature here, was ever de&s;ign'd for the good of
the State; which all narrowing and &s;ecluding Laws mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
weaken and enervate. Upon which account &s;ome were again&s;t a
Bill of a like Nature here in a time of War, that wou'd have been
for it, for the &s;ake of the Church, in a time of Peace. Tho that only
amounts to this, That they were again&s;t weakening <HI>England</HI> in a time
of War, le&s;t the Church &s;hou'd &s;uffer by it; but that they wou d
<PB N="23" REF="22">
be for weakening it in a time of Peace, becau&s;e the Church wou'd
then be out of Danger. Thus a Society, which &s;ome Men call the
Church, is &s;et up as a Corporation within our &s;elves, who&s;e Intere&s;t
is directly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Good of the State; at the &s;ame time,
that it is thought &s;uperior to that of the State: Which it &s;eems is to
be intirely &s;ubordinated to the Benefit and Advantage of this Soci|ety,
whenever they come in competition. And tho the Sabbath was
made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath; yet it &s;hou'd &s;eem,
that, in their Opinion, Mankind was made for a Set of Men that
call them&s;elves the Church, and not the Church for Mankind. So
that the only Di&s;pute between tho&s;e Men, who were again&s;t a Bill of
a like nature here, becau&s;e it was a time of War, and tho&s;e who
were for it, not with&s;tanding it was a time of War, was only which
was mo&s;t for the Benefit of this Corporation; whereas the Good of
<HI>England</HI> was quite out of the Que&s;tion depending betwixt them.</P>
<P>But they might ea&s;ily have &s;een that &s;uch an Act as that wo$'d have
put the <HI>Church,</HI> as it is a di&s;tinct Society from the State, into almo&s;t
as great Danger as the State it &s;elf. For it had put the Church intire|l$
into the Hands of a Faction, which might have turn'd again&s;t the
Church it &s;elf, and &s;et up for the Nonjuring or <HI>Galliean</HI> Church, or
have got the whole Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power into their own Hands, and
have made a lay-Church, and them&s;elves the Bi&s;hops of it. For when
a Tyrannical Power is once e&s;tabli&s;h'd, the very Men that e&s;tabli&s;h'd
it have no Security that they &s;han't be the fir&s;t that &s;hall feel its dire
Effects; or at lea&s;t, that they &s;hall not be drawn into and &s;uck'd up
$a that bottomle&s;s and un&s;atiable Whirlpool. This I mention the
rather, becau&s;e it is what has actually happen'd in <HI>Carolina.</HI> For the
very Faction that this Act has confirm'd and e&s;tabli&s;hed there, has
&s;ince cen&s;ur'd the Reverend Mr. <HI>Mar&s;&s;on,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Church o$
<HI>England</HI> in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> for three Pa&s;&s;ages of a Sermon $word$ ac$$ by
him there: Two of which Pa&s;&s;ages were not in the $word$ Setmon, $word$.
The fir&s;t and the la&s;t. And the third Pa&s;&s;age (which was the &s;econd
Pa&s;&s;age chang'd upon him) was only, that the $word$ a Divine
Right to a Maintenance: As may be &s;een by a Paper $word$ $word$
And after this Fa$tion in the Lower Hou&s;e had $word$ Mr. <HI>Mar&s;&s;on,</HI>
&s;on the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in his Se$mon, they proceed $word$ $word$ $$|nance
(which is only a Re&s;olution of both Houses to $word$ $word$
of his Sala$$ &s;ettled on him by Act of Parliament, and $word$ be|&s;ide
due to him by an Act of A&s;&s;embly: And $word$ $word$ $$ure and
Ordinance were made, without citing him or given $word$ any Op|portunity
to vindicate him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
And they have &s;ince colour'd over their Violences again&s;t this
Clergyman by a Law, as they did their Violences again&s;t the Peo|ple
in general, as has been before ob&s;erv'd. And have &s;ince this
Cen&s;ure and Ordinance brought in an Act, as prejudicial and fatal to
Epi&s;copacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N$. 10.</NOTE> as the former was to the Toleration: A Copy of which
is hereunto annex'd. By which Act they have intirely wre&s;ted the
Juri&s;diction over the Clergy, out of the Hands of the Bi&s;hop of
the Dioce&s;s, and have &s;et up a High Commi&s;&s;ion Court, and given
them&s;elves a merely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cognizance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the case of the $word$ Mr. Mar&s;$on $ere|unto an|nexd, N$. 14.</NOTE> as it was notorious
they threatned they wou'd &s;ome time before they accompli&s;h'd their
De&s;ign. And a much larger Cognizance it is, and a much greater
Power, than the Crown or the Bi&s;hops have over the Clergy here.
And however quietly this may be &s;ubmitted to by the Dioce&s;an,
now 'tis done by good Churchmen, yet 'tis ea&s;y to conceive what an
incredible Clamour this wou'd have rais'd, as a De&s;ign to ruin the
very E&s;&s;ence the Being of an Epi&s;copal Church, if it had been done
by any others. But 'tis very evident, that Characters and Names are
fir&s;t fix'd upon Men, and that all their Actions are judg'd of by
tho&s;e Characters. And &s;o it comes to pa&s;s, that &s;ome Men are ne|ver
allow'd to do any thing for the Service of the Church, as others
can &s;anctity the greate&s;t Sacrilege. Thus among the Pure, every
thing is pure; whil&s;t by the Impure, every thing is de&s;il'd. By this
means are the mo&s;t illegal Practices again&s;t this Clergyman ju&s;tify'd
by a Law, that is it &s;elf as illegal. And no body, I believe, that
takes this to be the Ca&s;e, will at all wonder, that Men that have a&s;|&s;um'd
a Power to them&s;elves &s;o de&s;tructive of the Con&s;titution of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> have &s;ince us'd that Power as injuriou&s;ly as they
have acquir'd it, to the depriving this Gentleman <HI>ab Officio,</HI> as the
Commons Hou&s;e had done by an Ordinance, <HI>a Beneficio.</HI> For 'tis
to be ob&s;erv'd, to this Clergyman's Honour, that he preach'd in his
Church as long as the Government wou'd allow him that Liberty,
after he had been, by the mo&s;t complicated Inju&s;tice imaginable, de|priv'd
of his Salary by an Ordinance of both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>By all which it appears, that the &s;ole view of that Set of Men, who have
abetted and pa&s;s'd this Act, was &s;o far from being any de&s;ign to re&s;train
the Di&s;&s;enters for the Good of the Church or State, that it was nothing
but a Con&s;piracy to de&s;troy the Di&s;&s;enters, and every thing in their Civil
and Ecclesia&s;tical Con&s;titution, that did but re&s;train'em from an uncon|trolable D$mination in the one and the other, in order to make them|&s;elves
by the Ruin of both. But every thing that did but check or re|&s;train'em
being now remov'd out of the way, and the Faction having
ingro&s;s'd and perpetuated the whole Power of the Province in their

the Je&s;uits, out of all the Archives which contain the Hi&s;tory of

good U&s;age and Probity, &s;utable to the Rules and De&s;igns of the Go&s;pel,</HI>
by which, as the 97<HI>th</HI> &sect; of the Fundamental Con&s;titutions admirably
expre&s;&s;es it, they can alone be won over to embrace and unfeignedly
receive the Truth. And I hope all Men who have been celebrated for
$uch Pa$ons and Heads of the Church, as that its very Security has been
at lea&s;t pretended to ebb and flow with their Power and Credit in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
I hope, I &s;ay, if any &s;uch have had any hand in pa&s;&s;ing this Bill, that
they will either di&s;own what they have done, and convince the World
<PB N="27" REF="26">
of the Sincerity of their Repentance, by undoing what they have &s;o
unju&s;tly done; or if they will not, that in Ju&s;tice to the Church of
<HI>England</HI> they will di&s;own her, or at lea&s;t that &s;he will for her own
Honour di&s;own them. And if any of the Per&s;ons who have had
any hand in pa&s;&s;ing this Bill, have any de&s;ign to bring in a Bill of a like
Nature here; 'tis to be hop'd, that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Carolina</HI> will at
lea&s;t gain their A&s;&s;i&s;tance by that means towards the repealing it there,
till the like Act be obtain'd here. Since 'tis certain that the Me|thods
by which this Bill has been obtain'd there, and the Effects it has
produc'd, are very far from recommending it to any true Friend of
our Con&s;titution in Church or State.</P>
<P>Thus it appears what the Men are that this Act will in all Probabi|lity
drive out of that Province, and what &s;ort of Men they are that
drive 'em out of it. Let us &s;ee then the Ruin and De&s;truction that
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue upon its being abandon'd, by &s;uch a Number of
&s;uch Inhabitants as this Act alone will drive away; without reckoning
tho&s;e that may be driven away by the other Infractions upon their
Con&s;titution in Church and State, that have both preceded and fol|low'd
it. And even the Depopulation that this Act will produce, mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be the utter <HI>Ruin</HI> of that Colony. For the Riches of a
Country are its Productions, which are to be barter'd for other Pro|ductions,
of other Parts of the World. Its Productions are the
Effects of Indu&s;try, and Indu&s;try the nece&s;&s;ary Effect of the Number
and Increa&s;e of Inhabitants. So that if you hinder the Increa&s;e and
le&s;&s;en the Number of the People, you abate and put a &s;top to all the
re&s;t. When the Hands are gone, that us'd to manure the Land,
clean the Rice, and graze the Cattle; and when the Merchants are
remov'd, that dealt in Furs, Pitch, Tar, Corn, Slaves and Negroes,
with other profitable Commodities, what will Proprietor&s;hips,
Signiorys, Baronys and Colonys be worth? And what will become
of the Revenue of Indu&s;try, that ari&s;es from the very Management of
the&s;e &s;everal Branches of Trade?</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t Proprietors</HI> were &s;o &s;en&s;ible that nothing could people that
Province, and enrich it, but an Univer&s;al and Ab&s;olute Toleration,
that they made the mo&s;t expre&s;s and ample Provi&s;ion for &s;uch a To|leration,
that ever was made in any Con&s;titution in the World.
As may be &s;een &sect; 96,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No. $word$</NOTE> 101, 102, 106. of the fundamental Con&s;ti|tutions
of <HI>Carolina:</HI> Which I am &s;atisfy'd will give a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure
to all true Friends to Liberty, who have not &s;een tho&s;e Paragraphs, to
peru&s;e. And that which is the more remarkable, is, that this ample
Provi&s;ion was made by &s;everal of the Proprietors, who were at that
time <HI>chief In&s;truments of the Per&s;ecution</HI> that was carried on again&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="27">
the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters here, as the <HI>Lord Chancellor Clarendon,</HI> the
<HI>Duke of Albermarle,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and others: Well knowing,
that how much &s;oever it might be for their private Intere&s;t to in&s;ti|gate
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to pro&s;ecure his Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enting Sub|jects
in <HI>England,</HI> and to promote tho&s;e Pro&s;ecutions as much as they
cou'd, in order to keep the Places and Power of <HI>England</HI> in their own
hands, that &s;o they might make their Fortunes at the Expence of the
Publick; yet that nothing but the large&s;t and be&s;t &s;ecur'd Toleration
cou'd ever make a Country, of which they were the Proprietors, turn
to a good account. And tho this Conduct does not much commend
their Faithfulne&s;s, as Stewards to the King or the Publick; yet it
makes their prudent management of a Province, which they were
to govern for them&s;elves, the more con&s;picuous. Nor did this uni|ver&s;al
and ab&s;olute Toleration di&s;appoint and fru&s;trate their Ex|pectations:
For tho <HI>Carolina</HI> wants a good Port, and is without &s;ome
other things that wou'd promote and facilitate Trade, yet by virtue of
this ample Toleration, and its Security in &s;uch an equal Con&s;titution of
Government, it became one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing of all our Colonys.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> of the fir&s;t Proprietors &s;eem to have been &s;o
&s;en&s;ible, that nothing could tend more to the making this Colony
rich and pro&s;perous, than pur&s;uing the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, that they re|&s;olv'd
upon confirming the Toleration that was at fir&s;t granted.
For in the Con&s;titutions they &s;ent over in the Year 1669. tho they left
out the greate&s;t part of the 96<HI>th</HI> Paragraph of the fir&s;t Fundamental
Con&s;titutions, becau&s;e they de&s;ign'd to reduce tho&s;e Con&s;titutions to a
&s;maller number; yet they left out nothing but what was barely in|troductory
to the Con&s;tituting and Ordaining part of that very Para|graph;
but have left the Ordaining part it &s;elf intire: And &s;o they
have all the other Paragraphs which were ju&s;t now cited out of the
fir&s;t Fundamental Con&s;titutions; which together with the 102<HI>d</HI> and
106<HI>th</HI> Paragraphs, may be &s;een in the la&s;t Fundamental Con&s;titu|tions,
&sect;. 27<HI>th,</HI> 31<HI>&s;t,</HI> 32<HI>d,</HI> 36<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>principal Merchants</HI> in <HI>London</HI> trading to <HI>Carolina</HI> were &s;o
&s;en&s;ible how prejudicial breaking in upon the Toleration there mu&s;t
be to the good of the Country in general, and to trade in particular,
that they &s;ign'd a Petition to the Lord <HI>Gr&mdash;nu&mdash;lie</HI> their pre&s;ent Pa$a|$ine,
and the re&s;t of the Proprietors, repre&s;enting how prejudicial it
won'd be to the true Intere&s;t of that Colony upon many accounts; and
p$aying that they would $i&s;allow the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Copy where for $word$ anne$$d, No. $word$.</NOTE> and order its Repeal.
Which Petition they lodg'd in the hands of Mr. <HI>B&mdash;ne</HI> the Agent
here on behalf of the oppre&s;s'd People of that Province. But he found
the &s;aid Palatine &s;o re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s this Act, that he &s;aw it was to no
purpo&s;e to deli$$ $word$ it to him.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
But tho the <HI>pre&s;ent Palatine</HI> has pur&s;u'd quite different Mea&s;ures
from all his Predece&s;&s;ors; and has obtain'd the Confent of a majo|rity
of that Board of Proprietors, which was &s;ummon'd and met up|on
that occa&s;ion, to con&s;irm this unprecedented Law; and tho 'tis
mo&s;t the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the re&s;t of the Proprietors to enquire, whether
the&s;e Mea&s;ures of his are the effect of want of due con&s;ideration, and
a true knowledg of his Intere&s;t, or of &s;heer Bigotry and Faction;
or whether the Party his Excellency is pleas'd to <HI>head and coun|tenance,</HI>
as he has thought fit to expre&s;s him&s;elf, have any &s;ecret
Ways to recompen&s;e him for gratifying them at the Expence of
his own apparent Intere&s;t and Obligations: Yet I believe every
con&s;idering Per&s;on will think it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Government to
take care, that by &s;uch Methods as the&s;e, a flouri&s;hing Colony be not
dep$pulated; and that a very u&s;eful and beneficial Trade, which
<HI>England</HI> drives with that Colony, and which that Colony drives
with <HI>England,</HI> and &s;everal of the Plantations, to the rai&s;ing her Ma|je&s;ty's
Cu&s;toms, as well as to the great conveniency and enriching
of her Maje&s;ty's Subjects, be not di&s;courag'd or interrupted.</P>
<P>Thus it appears how great an In&s;tance of Ingratitude to the Di&s;|&s;enters
this Act is; and how highly prejudicial to the Queen, to
Trade, to the Proprietors and the Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina.</HI> And the
Ingratitude and de&s;tructive Nature of this Act to the true Intere&s;t of
that Province, does not only &s;ix tho&s;e Characters upon the Act it
&s;elf, but upon tho&s;e that pa&s;s'd it; &s;ince its Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion
are too obvious for almo&s;t any one not to have &s;een, that did not
wilfully &s;hut his Eyes. But however it might perhaps be &s;aid, to ex|cu&s;e
them from being con&s;cious of the Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion of
this Act, that it is barely po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e that pa&s;s'd it to have been
ignorant of the generous Behaviour of the Di&s;&s;enters; and to have
been &s;o perfectly injudicious and unexperienc'd in publick Affairs, as
to imagine that to be for the Good of the Country, which mu&s;t ine|vitably
prove its Ruin; or to have been &s;o &s;et upon doing &s;omething,
that according to their Prejudices and mi&s;taken Notions might be for
the Service of the Church, as to have intirely forgot and over look'd
the Civil Intere&s;t of the Province. I &s;ay, all this might be &s;aid in
excu&s;e of this Act, and tho&s;e that pa&s;s'd it, if it were not a <HI>Breach of
the ex, u&s;s Original Contract</HI> between the Proprietors and the People
of <HI>Carolina.</HI> But if this Act appears to be a Breach of that Contract,
I think, as nothing further need to be &s;aid again&s;t the Act, &s;o nothing
can be &s;aid in vindication of the Makers of it. For when Men come
<PB N="30" REF="29">
once to breaking of Faith, tho plighted in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner
that can be devis'd; let it be broke with Hereticks or Schi&s;maticks,
or whom you plea&s;e, and let it be done never &s;o much for the Service
of God and his Church; I think, I &s;ay, &s;uch Men can't have the good
Opinion of any Prote&s;tant any longer, or ea&s;ily obtain it of any di&s;in|tere&s;ted
one, to &s;tand up in their Vindication or Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e't will be ea&s;ily allow'd to me, in order to make good this
Charge, that any Law of <HI>Carolina</HI> that contradicts the <HI>Charter,</HI> or
the fundamental Con&s;titutions of that Province, is a Breach of the
Original Contract between the Proprietors and the People. For
tho the two Charters (which do but grant different Parcels of Land,
but are el&s;e <HI>verbatim</HI> the &s;ame) being Grants from the Crown to the
Proprietors, of all the Title, Powers and Privileges which they
have as Proprietors of <HI>Carolina</HI> upon certain Conditions, is imme|diately
a Contract between the Sovereign and the Proprietors; up|on
which account any thing done by the Proprietors again&s;t the Char|ter
is a Forfeiture of the Charter, upon which a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> will
lie: Yet &s;everal of the Limitations in that Charter being Provi&s;ions
made by the Sovereign, in favour of his Liege and Free People who
&s;hou'd tran&s;plant them&s;elves thither, and in Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e Inhabi|tants
who were already there, and were not &s;ubject to the Title,
Powers and Privileges granted by &s;uch Charter, nor cou'd not be
made &s;ubject to the &s;aid Title, Powers and Privileges, without
their own Con&s;ent; therefore all &s;uch Limitations of the Proprie|tors,
in favour of the People, may be con&s;ider'd as tacit Stipulations
of the Proprietors with the People them&s;elves: Since they have &s;ub|mitted
to the Proprietors, or tran&s;planted them&s;elves to the Colony,
upon the ju&s;t Pre&s;umption, that the Proprietors wou'd act pur&s;uant
to &s;uch Provi&s;oes and Limitations.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>fundamental Con&s;titutions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sec. the Breamble to the fir&s;t Fundamen|tal con&s;ti|tution, N$ 2. See al&s;o &sect;. 120. of the &s;aid Con&s;titu|tions.</NOTE> they being the Rule of Go|vernment,
which, pur&s;uant to the Charters, the fir&s;t Proprietors oblig'd
them&s;elves their Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors to ob&s;erve perpetually, in the mo&s;t
binding ways that cou'd be devis'd, in ca&s;e the People &s;hou'd accept 'em;
if the People hereupon did accept 'em, they immediately became an ex|pre&s;s
Contract between the Proprietors and the People; and mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
be con&s;ider'd as &s;uch. Accordingly they were thought &s;o good
a Rule of Government by tho&s;e who were &s;ettled there before the
Grant of this Charter, and by &s;everal here, who tran&s;planted them|&s;elves
thither, in con&s;idence that they wou'd be ob&s;erv'd as the per|petual
Rule and Form of Government, that they were re&s;pectively
&s;worn to or &s;ub&s;crib'd by all tho&s;e that continu'd in <HI>Carolina,</HI> or came
to &s;ettle there, as the fundamental Con&s;titutions of the Province:
<PB N="31" REF="30">
And no Per&s;on cou'd become a Freeman, or enter upon any Office,
or vote or act in either Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, that had not fir&s;t &s;worn
to them, or &s;ub&s;cribed them, according to the Provi&s;ion made in
the 117 &sect; of the &s;aid Con&s;titutions: Which runs thus, <HI>Nor &s;hall
any Per&s;on, of what Condition or Degree &s;oever, above &s;eventeen years
old, have any E&s;tate or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in</HI> Carolina, <HI>or Protection or Benefit
of the Law there, who hath not before a Precinct-Regi&s;ter &s;ub&s;crib'd the&s;e
Fundamental Con&s;titutions.</HI></P>
<P>By which means the Proprietors became for ever bound to ob&s;erve
the&s;e Con&s;titutions, as the perpetual Rule of their Government, and can
never become di&s;engag'd, till all &s;uch of the People, as have con&s;ented to
'em, con&s;ent to repeal 'em, in the &s;ame manner in which they con&s;ented
to them; that is to &s;ay, till they con&s;ent to repeal them <HI>in Per&s;on.</HI> For
their <HI>Con&s;ent by their Repre&s;entatives</HI> can never be thought &s;ufficient,
unle&s;s Repre&s;entatives were cho&s;en on purpo&s;e to con&s;ent to repeal
the pre&s;ent fundamental Con&s;titutions, or &s;ettle new Con&s;titutions,
as to them &s;hou'd &s;eem mo&s;t meet and convenient. For a Repre&s;en|tative
of the People is no farther a Repre&s;entative than he is de|&s;ign'd
to repre&s;ent them. Now the Repre&s;entatives of the People
of <HI>Carolina</HI> are cho&s;en by their Principals, pur&s;uant to the&s;e Con&s;ti|tutions,
and are cho&s;en to act in repre&s;enting them, only in pur&s;u|ance
of the&s;e Con&s;titutions. And accordingly it is provided by the
Con&s;titutions, &sect;. 77. <HI>That if any proprietor or his Deputy, before the Palatine
or his Deputy's Con&s;ent be given to an Act of Parliament, &s;hall enter his Pro|te&s;tation
again&s;t the &s;aid Act, as contrary to any of the fundamental
Con&s;titutions; that in &s;uch Ca&s;e, after a full and free Debate, the &s;e|veral
E&s;tates &s;hall enter into four &s;everal Chambers, and if the Majority
of any of the four E&s;tates &s;hall vote that the Law is not agreeable to the&s;e
fundamental Con&s;titutions, then it &s;hall pa&s;s no further, but be as if it
had never been propos'd.</HI> By which the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI> plainly
appears to be ty'd up by the&s;e Con&s;titutions, and to have no power to
give them up, or to con&s;ent to their being repeal'd. So that it is very
plain that the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI> can no more con&s;ent to alter or
give up the fundamental Con&s;titutions of <HI>Carolina,</HI> than the Parlia|ment
of <HI>England</HI> can give up <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or the very Being and
Power of Parliaments.</P>
<P>But it is farther to be con&s;ider'd, that there is <HI>no Parliament</HI> properly
&s;peaking in <HI>Carolina.</HI> For there is no Upper Hou&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of the
Hereditary Landed Nobility of that Province, <HI>viz.</HI> Landgraves and
Ca&s;&s;iques, as by the fundamental Con&s;titutions there ought to be. And
they are the only Men that have any right to lay claim to the Stile and
Powers of the Upper Hou&s;e. Indeed the Deputys of the Proprietors
<PB N="32" REF="31">
arrogate to them&s;elves the Stile and Powers of the Upper Hou&s;e; but
they, or any other Set of Men than the Landgraves and Ca&s;&s;iques, may
as well pretend to be the Proprietors or the Commons Hou&s;e, as the
Upper Hou&s;e of Parliament of that Province. And therefore the
Preamble to the fundamental Con&s;titutions, that were drawn up in
1968,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N$. 3.</NOTE> and &s;ent over by Major <HI>Daniel,</HI> runs thus: <HI>We the Lords Pro|prietors,
with the Con&s;ent and Advice of the Landgraves and Ca&s;&s;iques,
and Commons in this pre&s;ent Parliament a&s;&s;embled,</HI> &amp;c. A certain Argu|ment
that the Proprietors were &s;atisfy'd that the&s;e Con&s;titutions
cou'd not be &s;ettled, nor the other repeal'd, without the Advice, at
lea&s;t, of the Landgraves and Ca&s;&s;iques, as well as the Commons in
Parliament a&s;&s;embled. So that there being no Upper Hou&s;e of Parli|ament
in <HI>Carolina,</HI> the Proprietors can never be releas'd from the
fir&s;t fundamental Con&s;titutions, tho a Parliament &s;hould be thought
to have the Power to relea&s;e them; becau&s;e without an Upper Hou&s;e
there is no Parliament.</P>
<P>But &s;o far is it from being true, that the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI>
has ever con&s;ented to the repealing the&s;e Con&s;titutions of 1669,
that the very <HI>Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly with the Depu'ys of the
Proprietors,</HI> who arrogate to them&s;elves the Stile and Power of the
Upper Hou&s;e, have never con&s;ented to repeal them. So that ei|ther
the&s;e are their Con&s;titutions, or they have none at all. And
if it be <HI>pretended that they have none at all,</HI> I would fain know how
any of them came by any of the Property they are now &s;eiz'd
of? By what Power the People ever met to chu&s;e Men to repre|&s;ent
them in the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly? By what Power
the Sheri$$s return'd them? Or by what Power &s;uch a Number of
Men a&s;&s;um'd to them&s;elves the Stile or Power of a Commons Hou&s;e of
A&s;&s;embly? All of which mu&s;t have been prior to all Laws. So that
'tis certain, that the Fundamental Con&s;titutions of 1609, common|ly
call'd the fir&s;t Fundamental Con&s;titutions, are and remain the Fun|damental
Con&s;titutions of <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the Proprietors agreed to &s;ome <HI>other Fundamental Con&s;titu|tions,</HI>
commonly call'd the la&s;t Fundamental Con&s;titutions; and &s;ent
them over by Major <HI>Damd</HI> in the year 1698,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> to <HI>be confirm'd, by and with
the Con&s;ent of the Hereditary Nobility, Landgraves and Ca&s;&s;iques, and the
Commons in Parl$iament a&s;&s;embled,</HI> tho very little di&s;&s;e$$g in any thing
but length from tho&s;e of 16$$9. But the&s;e never were confirm'd in
Parliament, $word$ is there any Parliament (of which Landgraves and
$word$ compo&s;e one Hou&s;e) to confirm them. So that there is not
the $word$ p$etence to &s;ay that the&s;e of 1698, are the fundamental
Con&s;titution of <HI>Carolina,</HI> or that tho&s;e of 1669 are not.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
Thus it appears that the Charters and the Fundamental Con&s;titu|tions
of 1669, are the original Contract between the Proprietors
and the People: Let us &s;ee then how this Contract has been bro|ken
by this di&s;qualifying Act. And the <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> of this Act
with this Contract, will appear very plainly, if we con&s;ider the
Matter and Form of this Law, and the Manner of obtaining it. The
<HI>Act it &s;elf</HI> is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Charter of</HI> K. <HI>Charles</HI> II.
<HI>That Charter empowers the Proprietors to make,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Charter, p. 3. col. 1. hereunto am$$'d, N$ 1.</NOTE> <HI>ordain and enact Laws;
only of and with the Advice, A&s;&s;ent and Approbation of the Freemen of
the &s;aid Province, or of the greater part of them, or of their Delegates
or Deputys.</HI> Now by this Act the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly
may happen to be &s;o compos'd, as that there &s;hall not be <HI>one De|puty</HI>
or Delegate of the Freemen of the Province in it. For by
this Act it may &s;o happen, that not one that &s;hall &s;it there, &s;hall
have a Majority of the Votes of the Freemen; without which,
I &s;uppo&s;e, 'twill not be pretended that any one is a Deputy or
Delegate. For upon &s;uppo&s;ition that a Di&s;&s;enter &s;hou'd &s;tand
for every Place that has a Right to &s;end a Deputy or Delegate to
Parliament, and &s;hould have never &s;o great a Majority of Votes
in all tho&s;e Places, and be return'd; yet upon the Meeting of
the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, they ought all to quit their
Seats, pur&s;uant to this Act; and tho&s;e Candidates, who had the
next Majority of Votes to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Act, c. u$$</NOTE> mu&s;t fill their Places, tho per|haps
they had not the half of the Votes, that the Delegate had,
being a Di&s;&s;enter.</P>
<P>And tho perhaps it will be &s;aid, that I have put a Ca&s;e which
can never happen; becau&s;e if it &s;hou'd happen, that all the Members,
that &s;hou'd be return'd to Parliament, &s;hould be Di&s;&s;enters, they
would repeal this Law, and continue them&s;elves the first thing
they did; yet if this &s;hou'd be done, in &s;uch Ca&s;e, 'tis what ac|cording
to this Act cou'd not be done. And at lea&s;t this Ab&s;urdi|ty
will follow, that, in &s;uch Ca&s;e, according to Law the Com|mons
Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly would con&s;i&s;t of a Body of Men legally
return'd, in which there was not one Delegate of the People.
And it may in <HI>Fact</HI> happen according to this Act, that the Pro|prietors
may make Laws without a Majority of the Delegates of
the Freemen, all the Delegates being pre&s;ent; which is a Ca&s;e as
much again&s;t the Charter as the other. The Commons Hou&s;e of
A&s;&s;embly in <HI>Carolina</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of Thirty: Let us &s;uppo&s;e then Four|teen
of the&s;e Thirty, duly return'd by the Sher$$$s, to be Di&s;&s;en|ters;
the other Sixteen mu&s;t turn them out, and vote tho&s;e Can|didates
<PB N="34" REF="33">
into the Hou&s;e, who had the greate&s;t Number of Votes
next to them, in their Places. In that ca&s;e the Hou&s;e wou'd con|&s;i&s;t
of &s;ixteen Delegates and fourteen Men, who are no more De|legates,
than they are Nobility or Proprietors. Let us further
&s;uppo&s;e one of the &s;ixteen to die, and then before his Place
cou'd be fill'd, the Hou&s;e would con&s;i&s;t of fifteen Delegates and four|teen
Men, who in reality are no Delegates. Let us then &s;uppo&s;e a
Bill to be brought into the Commons Hou&s;e, thus compos'd and
con&s;tituted; and let us &s;uppo&s;e one of the Delegates (whom we
will farther &s;uppo&s;e to be the Speaker) with the fourteen Men who
are no Delegates, to be for this Bill, and the other fourteen Dele|gates
to be again&s;t it: In this Ca&s;e, the Hou&s;e being equally divided,
the Speaker with the fourteen Men, who are no Delegates, wou'd
carry this Bill again&s;t the fourteen Delegates; and &s;o a Bill wou'd
pa&s;s thro the Commons Hou&s;e, with the Advice and Con&s;ent of but
one Delegate again&s;t fourteen.</P>
<P>But if &s;o great a Breach and Violation of the Charter &s;hould never
happen to the Freemen by this di&s;qualifying Act, as may happen in
the Ca&s;es which we have ju&s;t now put; yet whenever this Act is put
in execution, and a Man that has a Minority is voted into the Hou&s;e in
pur&s;uance of this Act, there will be an utter Defeating of the Right
the Freemen of the re&s;pective Countys have to a <HI>Repre&s;entation,</HI> pur&s;u|ant
to the &s;aid Charter. For a Man, who is not cho&s;en by the Majo|rity,
is no more a Repre&s;entative, than a Proprietor, or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus this Act appears to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Charter, in as
much as, by virtue of it, Laws may be made without the Advice
and Con&s;ent of the Freemen, or their Delegates: But neither is it
con&s;i&s;tent with the Charter for the Proprietors to make what Laws
<HI>they plea&s;e, with the Con&s;ent of the &s;aid Freemen or their Delegates.</HI> For
the Charter re&s;trains the &s;aid Proprietors to the making of &s;uch Laws
only, of and with the Advice and Con&s;ent of the Freemen, as &s;hall
be con&s;onant to Rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed Charter, p. 4. col. 2.</NOTE> and agreeable, as near as may be, to the
Laws of <HI>England.</HI> Let us enquire then whether this Act be not in|con&s;i&s;tent
with the&s;e Re&s;trictions and Provi&s;oes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Re&s;trictions is <HI>Con&s;onancy to Rea&s;on;</HI> by which two
things are chiefly intended: That the Laws made of and with the Ad|vice
of the Freemen &s;hould be founded in Equity and Ju&s;tice, and that
they &s;hould be for the Advantage and Service of the Publick. But is
the excluding Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly
<HI>founded in Equity and Ju&s;tice?</HI> Is it ju&s;t or equitable to exclude tho&s;e
from &s;o high a Tru&s;t, who have as great a &s;hare of that which is to
<PB N="35" REF="34">
be intru&s;ted as any there? Is it ju&s;t to exclude two Thirds of the
Inhabitants for the &s;ake of one? Is it equitable to deprive them
of the High Tru&s;ts of that Province, who bear by far the greater
&s;hare of its Burdens? Is it fair to deprive tho&s;e of this Privi|lege,
who tran&s;planted them&s;elves thither, to the great Danger
and Hazard of their Lives and Effects; and became &s;ubject to the
Proprietors, upon the Pro&s;pect of being equally capable of this
Privilege with the re&s;t of their Neighbours? Or is it rea&s;onable,
to make tho&s;e incapable, that are every way as capable as any,
and that are by far more capable than &s;ome who remain &s;o? To
put a Mark of Di&s;grace upon tho&s;e who have done nothing to
de&s;erve it? And to rai&s;e Fears and Apprehen&s;ions in tho&s;e who
ought to live with the Peace and Quiet of Mind, that belongs to an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject?</P>
<P>And from what has been &s;aid before, it mu&s;t follow, that this
Law is as far from being for the <HI>Advantage and Intere&s;t</HI> of that Pro|vince,
as Per&s;ecution is from being for its Advantage in general;
and that it is particularly as far from being for its Intere&s;t,
as it can be to &s;eclude a Body of Men from ever advi&s;ing with
the Properietors about making and ordaining Laws, who are
as well fitted by their Prudence, Integrity and Intere&s;t, to advi&s;e
with 'em, as any in the Province. In one word, 'tis as much
again&s;t the Intere&s;t of that Province, as a Per&s;ecution can be,
that will drive away two Thirds of the Inhabitants, which in
all don't exceed 10000 Souls, out of a Country, which is inha|bited
from North to South about 150 Miles, and about 50 from
Ea&s;t to We&s;t: And which mu&s;t in Rea&s;on, as it has in Fact, end in
e&s;tabli&s;hing the Government in a Faction, to the utter Ruin of
the Con&s;titution in Church and State: And that can end in nothing,
but driving away the be&s;t, and leaving only the wor&s;t of the few
Inhabitants, that &s;hall remain.</P>
<P>The other Re&s;triction is, <HI>Agreeablene&s;s as near as may be to the
Laws of</HI> England. This the Framers of this Act were &s;o &s;en&s;ible
of, that they found this Act upon the Suppo&s;ition that the like Act
is in force in <HI>England:</HI> A plain Intimation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the l'$$amble to the Act, N$$ 6. p. 38.</NOTE> that they knew that
this Act cou'd not be valid without it. However fal&s;e the A&s;&s;er|tion
is, yet, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Framers of this Act had po&s;itive Infor|mation,
that after the Occa&s;ional Bill &s;hould pa&s;s here (which their
Corre&s;pondents it &s;eems were very &s;ure of) that another would pa&s;s
for excluding the Di&s;&s;enters the Hou&s;e of Commons. And tho, God
be prais'd, their Information prov'd fal&s;e; yet it lets us farther into
<PB N="36" REF="35">
the &s;ecret De&s;igns of the Authors and Promoters of the Occa|&s;ional
Bill here, than they cou'd ever yet be brought to own.
But it has been an old Ob&s;ervation, that under &s;ome Admini|&s;trations,
the be&s;t home News was always to be &s;een in the Arti|cles
from <HI>Paris:</HI> And I believe it has been this once as true of
the Accounts from <HI>Carolina:</HI> And perhaps the farther Laws and
Preceedings there will confirm this Ob&s;ervation, and will give us
the be&s;t Light into the Steps that were to have been taken here,
if the Predictions which were &s;ent to <HI>Carolina</HI> about a Bill of the
&s;ame nature in <HI>England,</HI> in order to give the better face to this Bill
there, had come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor is this Act more incon&s;i&s;tent with the Charter, than with the
<HI>Fundamental Con&s;titutions of Carolina.</HI> They provide, $word$. 97, 101.
<HI>That</HI> &s;ince the Natives of that Place, who will be concern'd in our Plan|tations,
are utter Strangers to Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e Idolatry, Ignorance,
or Mi&s;take, gives us no Right to expel or u&s;e them ill; and that tho&s;e
who remove from other Parts to plant there, will unavoidably be of dif|ferent
Opinions concerning Matters of Religion, the Liberty whereof they
will expect to have allow'd them; and <HI>that</HI> it will not be rea&s;onable for
us on this account to keep them out, <HI>therefore</HI> that Civil Peace may
be maintain'd amid&s;t the diver&s;ity of Opinions, and our Agreement
and Compact with all Men may be duly and faithfully ob&s;erv'd, the
Violation whereof, upon what pretence &s;oever, cannot be without great Of|fence
to Almighty God, and great Scandal to the true Religion which we
profe&s;s: And al&s;o that Jews, Heathens, and other Di&s;&s;enters from the
Purity of Chri&s;tian Religion, may not be &s;car'd and kept at a di&s;tance from
it; but by having an opportunity of acquaninting them&s;elves with the
Truth and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of its Doctrines, and the Peaceablene&s;s and Inof|&s;en&s;ivene&s;s
of its Profe&s;&s;ors, may by good U&s;age and Per&s;ua&s;ion, and all
tho&s;e convincing Methods of Gentlene&s;s and Meekne&s;s, &s;utable to the Rules
and De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, be won over to embrace, and unfeignedly rec$ive
the Truth. <HI>Therefore the &s;aid Con&s;titutions among other things
provide, $word$. 101. That</HI> no Per&s;on above &s;eventeen Years of Age, &s;hall have
any benefit or protection of the Law, or be capable of any place of Pro|fit
or Honour, which is not a Member of &s;ome Church or Profe&s;&s;ion,
having his Name recorded in &s;ome one religious Record at once. <HI>The
Con&s;titutions therefore require nothing more to make any Per|&s;on
capable of any Place of profit or Honour, than to be a Mem|ber
of &s;ome Church or Profe&s;&s;ion, and to have his Name in &s;ome
one, and but one religious Record at once. So that this Act that</HI>
requires <HI>Men to be of the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Church of</HI> England <HI>only,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
to make them capable of &s;itting in the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;em|bly,
is a direct violation of the&s;e Fundamental Con&s;titutions. And
as the Ordaining part of this Act is a violation of them, &s;o is the</HI>
Preamble <HI>too, upon which the ordaining part of this Act is built.
For that &s;uppo&s;es, that the be&s;t way to prevent Contentions, and
Animo&s;ities in the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, upon the ac|count
of different Per&s;ua&s;ions and Intere&s;ts in Matters of Religion,
is to make Per&s;ons of a different Per&s;ua&s;ion, incapable of the Ho|nour
of</HI> &s;itting <HI>there. Whereas the</HI> 97th <HI>and the</HI> 101 &s;t <HI>Paragraphs
a&s;&s;ert,</HI> That to maintain Civil Peace amid&s;t the diver&s;ities of Opinions,
<HI>the be&s;t way is to</HI> require nothing more to make Men capable of any Places
of Honour or Profit, than to be of &s;ome one Profe&s;&s;ion or other.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee upon how many Accounts this Act it &s;elf is incon&s;i|&s;tent
with the Original Contract. Nor is it le&s;s &s;o upon the account
of tho&s;e <HI>illegal and undue Methods</HI> by which it was obtain'd: So that
had this Act been never &s;o con&s;onent to Rea&s;on, and agreeable to
the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> yet it had been <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> void, becau&s;e it
was obtain'd in a manner directly contrary to other Provi&s;ions of
the Charter, and of the Fundamental Con&s;titutions. For it was
in the fir&s;t place pa&s;s'd without the Advice and Con&s;ent of tho&s;e,
without whom no Law can pa&s;s in <HI>Carolina.</HI> For it is provided by
the Fundamental Con&s;titutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fund. Con&s;t. N$$. 2. $word$. 9, 71.</NOTE> That the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI>
&s;hall con&s;i&s;t of <HI>Landgraves and Ca&s;&s;iques</HI> (who are by their Dignity
to have Right of Se&s;&s;ion, and are the Hereditary Nobility of <HI>Caro|lina</HI>)
as well as of Proprietors and Freeholders; and that no Act
&s;hall pa&s;s but with their Con&s;ent and Advice. But this Act was obtain'd
without &s;o much as calling the &s;aid Landgraves and Ca&s;&s;iques; &s;o far
was this Act from pa&s;&s;ing with their Advice and Con&s;ent. By which
it is plain, that this is no more an Act of <HI>Carolina,</HI> than an Act pa&s;s'd
by the Queen, with the Advice of the Commons, without the Advice
of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, would be a law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Act was pa&s;t without the Advice and Con&s;ent
of tho&s;e who ought to have been call'd; &s;o it was in the next
place pa&s;s'd by <HI>tho&s;e who had no Right</HI> to Ordain or Enact any
Law or Ordinance what&s;oever. The Charter gives the Proprietors
power to pa&s;s Laws con&s;onant to Rea&s;on, and agreeable, as near as
may be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter, N$$. 1. p. Col. 1. $$un Con N$$ 2. $word$ $$2.</NOTE> to the Laws of <HI>England; only by and with the Advice of the
Freemen, or of the majority of the &s;aid Freemen, or of their</HI> Delegates.
And the Fundamental Con&s;titutions require, that every Man that
chu&s;es a Member of Parliament, &s;hall have fifty Acres of Free|hold.
But this di&s;qualifying Act was pa&s;s'd by Delegates, who were
cho&s;en in <HI>Berkley</HI>-County (which &s;ends Twenty out of the Thirty
<PB N="38" REF="37">
that compo&s;e that whole Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly) by Jews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Repr. N$$. 5. Art. 18.</NOTE>
Strangers, Sailors, Servants, Negroes; and by almo&s;t every French|man,
who never profer'd them&s;elves to take the Oaths of Alle|giance
(which was the only thing requir'd of them, in order to
their Naturalization) in <HI>Craven</HI> and <HI>Berkley</HI>-County. All the&s;e
Votes were taken by the Sheriff, according to expre&s;s In&s;tructions
from &s;ome in the Government, as the &s;aid Sheriff publickly con|fe&s;s'd.
And the Candidates they voted for were Return'd by the
Majority that &s;uch illegal Votes gave them, to the great Prejudice
of the other Candidates, and the Freemen and Free-holders of
the &s;aid Countys. Nor has there been any Redre&s;s to be had in
the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly again&s;t the&s;e undue Elections and
Returns.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding that the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly was
compos'd of Members &s;o unduly Cho&s;en and Return'd; yet as bad as it
was, the Faction &s;aw, they &s;hould not be able to get this Act to pa&s;s
that Hou&s;e, but by &s;urprize. Wherefore the Governor, Sir <HI>Nath.
John&s;on,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Addre&s;s, No. 7. Col. 1.</NOTE> prorogu'd the A&s;&s;embly, after it had met, to the 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI>
The A&s;&s;embly was di&s;per&s;t, and &s;everal of the Members went to
their re&s;pective Countys, and order'd their Affairs &s;o, as that they
might be able to return when the Prorogation &s;hould expire.
But all on a &s;udden, contrary to the very nature of a Progroga|tion,
they were call'd together by Proclamation, to &s;it on the
26th of <HI>April.</HI> But that the Members might not be too much
alarm'd, the A&s;&s;embly was continu'd together Seven or Eight days,
with little or no Bu&s;ine&s;s before them. But on the 4th of <HI>May,</HI>
when the Members at a di&s;tance were under no apprehen&s;ion of
any Matter coming upon the Stage, which &s;hould induce them to
return, to the great Inconveniency of their own Bu&s;ine&s;s, before
the &s;aid 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May;</HI> I &s;ay, upon the &s;aid 4<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> this Bill
was brought into the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, and hurry'd
&s;o precipitately through that Hou&s;e, that it pa&s;t the 6<HI>th,</HI> four days
before the Time came, to which they were prorogu'd; and con&s;e|quently
<HI>four days before any legal A&s;&s;embly cou'd be held.</HI> By this means
there were never above Twenty three Members of the Commons
Hou&s;e pre&s;ent from the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI> From
whence it follows, that almo&s;t one Fourth of the Hou&s;e mu&s;t have
been ab&s;ent: And of the Twenty three that were pre&s;ent, there
was but One more for it than again&s;t it; and &s;everal of tho&s;e
that were again&s;t it, were Members of the Church of <HI>England.</HI>
And if the other Seven had been there, the Bill had, in all pro|bability,
<PB N="39" REF="38">
never pa&s;s'd: So that it could never have <HI>got thro the wor &s;t
Commons Hou&s;e</HI> that ever &s;at in <HI>Carolina,</HI> but by &s;uch <HI>like illegal
Practices,</HI> as had procur'd the Elections and Returns of the Majority of
tho&s;e that compos'd it.</P>
<P>And to the re&s;t of the&s;e Arbitrary Proceedings, the Upper Hou&s;e
added that of the refu&s;ing <HI>Landgrave Jo&s;eph Morton,</HI> a Deputy to
one of the Proprietors, the Liberty of entring his <HI>Prote&s;tation</HI> and
Di&s;&s;ent: Notwith&s;tanding that there is an expre&s;s Provi&s;ion made
for a Liberty of prote&s;ting in the 77<HI>th</HI> $word$ of the Fundamental Con&s;ti|tutions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">N$$ 2.</NOTE>
Nor is a Deputy's Right of Prote&s;ting only the bare
empty Privilege, to have it &s;tand upon Record, that he did not
give his Con&s;ent to &s;uch a Law; but is the Foundation of putting
a Que&s;tion to each of the &s;everal E&s;tates &s;eparately, whether the
Act be not contrary to the Fundamental Con&s;titutions, and of a Right
that the Majority of any of the E&s;tates have in &s;uch ca&s;e to the
rejecting the &s;aid Act; as may be fully &s;een in the &s;aid 77<HI>th</HI> Paragraph.</P>
<P>But that it may appear that this Act wants nothing that can
tend to make it the mo&s;t fini&s;h'd Piece of Inju&s;tice, of any thing that
ever had the Face of Law; it mu&s;t be noted, that it is not only illegal
upon the account of the Matter of the Law, and the Methods of
obtaining it; but upon the account of its very <HI>Form and Stile.</HI> For
there is fir&s;t of all an U&s;urpation of the Regal Authority in the
Stile of the Act. For it runs thus: Be it enacted by his Excellency
<HI>John Lord Granville,</HI> and the re&s;t of the true <HI>and ab&s;olute Lords and
Proprietors of</HI> Carolina: A Stile never a&s;&s;um'd by them till very
lately. Nor can it be pleaded in Vindication of this Stile, that they
are &s;til'd &s;o in the Charter: For there they are &s;til'd &s;o with two
Savings, neither of which are here expre&s;t:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart N$$ 1. p. 2 col. 2.</NOTE> The one of the Right
of the Crown, the other of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects &s;ettl'd there at the
time of the granting the Charter, if there were any.</P>
<P>And as it has too much upon this Account to have the Form of an Act
of <HI>Carolina;</HI> &s;o it has too little upon another. For this Act is not &s;aid
to be enacted by the Palatine, and the re&s;t of the Proprietors <HI>by and
with the Advice of the Landgraves and Ca&s;&s;iques,</HI> as 'tis plain all their Acts
&s;hould run; as fully appears by the Form of the Preamble to the
fir&s;t and &s;econd Fundamental Con&s;titutions: But in&s;tead of being
enacted in this Form, it is only &s;aid to be enacted by the Authority
of the Palatine, and the re&s;t of the Proprietors, by and with the
Advice and Con&s;ent of the <HI>re&s;t of the Members of the General A&s;&s;embly.</HI>
A Stile altogether as new as is that of the Proprietors. By all
<PB N="40" REF="39">
which it plainly appears, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any Act to
have any Ab&s;urdity or Illegality that this has not.</P>
<P>And tho it very much imports the Palatine, and the Proprietors to
take Care to inform them&s;elves of the true State of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and to be
watchful in di&s;covering and rectifying any Abu&s;es that may creep into
the Admini&s;tration of Government there; both in a ju&s;t Regard to their
own true Intere&s;t, and Obligations to the Intere&s;t of the People,
who have &s;ubjected them&s;elves to their Government: Yet they have
been &s;o far from this, as to <HI>neglect</HI> the repeated Applications of the poor
oppre&s;s'd People again&s;t this Law, with the greate&s;t Partiality and
Arbitraryne&s;s imaginable. Mr. <HI>A&mdash;h,</HI> who was fir&s;t &s;ent over as
Agent in their behalf, would have told the World how little Encou|ragement
he had met with from the palatine and Proprietors, if he had
liv'd to have fini&s;h'd a Tract which he was publi&s;hing (and which we
have mention'd before) entitul'd <HI>The pre&s;ent State of Affairs in</HI> Carolina.
And Mr. <HI>B&mdash;ne,</HI> who &s;ucceeded this Gentleman in his Solicitation on their
behalf, apply'd to the Palatine &s;even Weeks before he could obtain a
Board of Proprietors to be call'd, in order to con&s;ider whether this Bill
&s;hould be ratify'd or repeal'd. When it was call'd, one Mr. <HI>A&mdash;chd&mdash;le,</HI>
who is become a Proprietor &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing this Act, and was formerly
Governor of <HI>Carolina,</HI> who&s;e Prudence and Integrity procur'd him
the univer&s;al Re&s;pect of the Inhabitants there, oppos'd the ratifying
this Bill at the &s;aid Board; as a Bill, that was highly injurious to the
Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters of that Province in particular, and to the
true Intere&s;t of the Proprietors and all the People in general: But
the An&s;wer he receiv'd from the Palatine to all his Rea&s;ons, was
this; which &s;hews that no Rea&s;ons of that kind, how &s;trongly
&s;oever they might be urg'd, could have any weight with him;
<HI>Sir, you are of one Opinion, and I am of another, and our Lives may
not be long enough to end the Controver&s;y; I am for this Bill, and
this is the Party that I will head and countenance.</HI> After he had ex|pre&s;s'd
him&s;elf in this manner, Mr. <HI>B&mdash;ne</HI> pray'd he might be
heard by Coun&s;el again&s;t this Act, to &s;atisfy his Principals that
he had neglected nothing that cou'd be for their Service; tho
he ea&s;ily perceiv'd from the An&s;wer his Excellency gave Mr.
<HI>A&mdash;chd&mdash;le,</HI> that it cou'd &s;erve no other end: But he only re|ceiv'd
this An&s;wer; <HI>What Bu&s;ine&s;s has Coun&s;el here? It is a pruden|cial
A$$t in me, and I will do as I &s;ee fit: I &s;ee no harm at all in
this Bill, and am re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s it.</HI> How happy is the Province
that has a Palatine of &s;uch &s;ingular Ju&s;tice, Prudence and Huma|nity?
And how unhapy is the Country that has lo&s;t a Mini&s;ter
<PB N="41" REF="40">
endu'd with &s;o many great and excellent Qualitys? Well may
both Church and State be thought to be in danger by the Me|moriali&s;t,
when &s;o $$minent a Patron of the Libertys of the one,
and of the Religion of the other, &s;hall have lo&s;t any &s;hare of his
Credit and Preferments. Accordingly he &s;ign'd the Bill that day,
the Board con&s;i&s;ting but of three of the Proprietors pre&s;ent, and
two Proxys, which were lodg'd in his Excellency's Hands.</P>
<P>When no more notice is taken of the Application that is made to
this Board by Numbers, nor any Redre&s;s given to publick Grievan|ces,
'tis no wonder if <HI>private Complaints</HI> are entirely neglected. The
Clergyman, who is Mini&s;ter of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> has this therefore to
comfort him&s;elf withal, that his Ca&s;e is not particular, tho the Pro|prietors
have had no regard to the repeated Complaints that he has
made to them, of the In&s;olencys offer'd him in the Streets, where
his Gown was torn off his Back, and he whipt with a Hor&s;ewhip,
and beaten and abusd'd in a mo&s;t barbarous manner by &s;ome of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable of that Party, which his Excellency <HI>is re&s;olv'd to
head and countenance.</HI></P>
<P>But tho neither the Palatine, nor the Majority of the Board of Pro|prietors
have had any Relentings on the account of the&s;e oppre&s;s'd
People; yet the <HI>&s;ame Commons Hou&s;e</HI> of A&s;&s;embly, which pa&s;s'd this
Act, have thought it to be &s;o contrary to natural Equity, the Chri&s;|tian
Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be
&s;o great an In&s;tance of Ingratitude to the Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;o highly
injurious and de&s;tructive to their Libertys and Con&s;titution, that a
Bill to repeal the &s;aid Act pa&s;t thro that Hou&s;e, about half a year
after they had pa&s;s'd it. But it was lo&s;t in the Upper Hou&s;e, where
every thing is carry'd according to the Inclinations of the Palatine,
and tho&s;e Proprietors, who give up them&s;elves to be directed and
influenc'd by him. And upon the Commons Hou&s;e pa&s;&s;ing the &s;aid
repealing Bill, the Governor, in great Indignation, di&s;&s;olv'd the &s;aid
Commons Hou&s;e, by the name of the <HI>Un&s;teddy A&s;&s;embly.</HI></P>
<P>This is a true and faithful Account, both of the State of <HI>Caro|lina,</HI>
which occa&s;ion'd the pa&s;&s;ing this Act, and the deplorable Con|dition
into which this Act has brought it. And as no body, who
does not que&s;tion his Excellency's Veracity, can imagine that he did
not &s;incerely de&s;ign to head and countenance nothing but a $$action in
<HI>Carolma,</HI> when he declar'd he wou'd do &s;o; &s;o he has given no body
&s;ince any Rea&s;on to think that he has alter'd his Re&s;olutions. And it
would therefore be the greate&s;t Folly and Pre&s;umption imaginable, to
hope for a Redre&s;s from his Exccellency, or from tho&s;e Proprietors
<PB N="42" REF="41">
who are influenc'd by him (and who make a Majority at that Board)
of any Grievances, how publick &s;oever, if they may but be for the
private Advantages of that Party. And his Excellency, together with
tho&s;e Proprietors, making a Majority at that Board, gives this heavy
Accent to all the Mi&s;erys of the People, and particularly of the Di&s;|&s;enters
of that Province, That according to the pre&s;ent Frame of
Government that obtains there, they are irremediable.</P>

<HI>James Moor,</HI> E&s;&abque; one of the &s;aid Depu|ties,
knowing the Party he had among&s;t
the Deputies, and nothing regarding
how Di&s;loyal, how Derogatory from
the ju&s;t Right of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne
that Objection was, objected again&s;t the
&s;aid <HI>Landgrave Jo&s;eph Morton,</HI> That he
the &s;aid <HI>Jo&s;eph Morton</HI> had made a Breach
of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by the true
and ab&s;olute <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Proprietors,</HI> &amp;c.
by accepting of a Commi&s;&s;ion for Judge

when at the &s;ame Time he had a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
from the &s;aid Proprietors for the
&s;aid Office, in whom the Di&s;po&s;al of the
&s;ame was: Now, be&s;ides the Di&s;loyalty
of this Objection, it was al&s;o fal&s;e; for
it appears not by the Charter, That the
<HI>Proprietors</HI> can impower any one to try
Per&s;ons for Facts committed out of their
Dominions, and which is nece&s;&s;ary for
&s;uch Judge; yet &s;uch was his Intere&s;t,
that on this his Objection, <HI>Landgrave
<PB N="30" REF="71">
Morton</HI> was Rejected, and the &s;aid <HI>James
Moore</HI> $$lected and declared Governour.
Of this <HI>landgrave Morton</HI> Inform'd, and
Complain'd to the <HI>Proprietors,</HI> but to no
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Power thus bodly gotten, Mr.
<HI>Moore</HI> re&s;olves to make the be&s;t u&s;e of it;
and therefore finding him&s;elf too poor,
even with the Countenance of his Office,
to make any con&s;iderable Profit of the
<HI>Indian</HI> Trade, he &s;ays a De&s;ign of get|ting
it wholly into his Power. This he
attempted by getting a Bill brought into
the A&s;&s;embly at the latter end of the
Year 1700, Intituled, <HI>A Bill for Regula|ting
the</HI> Indian <HI>Trade,</HI> but &s;o contriv'd as
to have made him wholly Ma&s;ter of it.
But Mr. <HI>Robert Stephens,</HI> Mr. <HI>Trott</HI> then
no Courtier) and &s;ome others &s;o plainly
&s;hew'd its ill Aim, that it was thrown out
of the A&s;&s;embly, as it was again in the be|ginning
of the Year 1701. On which Mr.
<HI>Moore</HI> perceiving, That that A&s;&s;embly
could not be prevailed with to an&s;wer his
Ends, he di&s;&s;olved the A&s;&s;embly, and
about the latter End of that Year a New
one was cho&s;en, at the Election of which,
tho' the Right of Electing be by the
Charter in the Freeholders only, he &s;o
Influenc'd the Sheriff, that Strangers,
Servants, Aliens, nay <HI>Malatoes</HI> and <HI>Ne|g$o$s</HI>
were Polled, and Returns made
accordingly. Such as at the Place oppo|&s;ed
tho&s;e Practices, were abu&s;ed, nay, a&s;|faulted
by Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Favourites. By
this Means, having got &s;everal into the
A&s;&s;embly, of neither Sen&s;e nor Credit,
but &s;uch as would Vote as he would have
them, he there kept them from being
thrown out on the Petition of tho&s;e who
were unju&s;tly excluded by their being
Return'd, by repeated and &s;trangely pro|cur'd
Adjournments and Prorogations,
until the Proclamation of our New War
with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> arriv'd. Then
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the People by Stories with
hopes of mighty Plunder, he got a De|&s;ign
that he had propo&s;ed to the A&s;&s;em|bly
before, of going again&s;t St. <HI>Augustin,</HI>
a $word$ belonging to <HI>Spain,</HI> a little to the
Southward of <HI>Carolina,</HI> to be approved,
tho' in truth it was no more than a Pro|ject
of $$$booting under the &s;pecious
Name of War, for neither the Prepara|tion
nor the Performance will permit
any one to believe it was meant for any
other Purpo&s;e, or the lea&s;t Good of the
Colony.</P>
<P>However, it was approved, and Two
Thou&s;and Pounds were rai&s;ed to equip
his Honour and his Comrades out for
their beloved Exerci&s;e of Plundering,
and Slave-catching. This they perform|ed
well enough, but carrying on the Pre|tence
too far, and coming to &s;it down
before the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI>
while they were &s;ending their Pl$nder to
<HI>Jamaica</HI> by their tru&s;ty Officers, under
Colour of &s;eeking Supplies, &s;$nding for
Bombs and Morrars, in the mid&s;t of all
their Riot and M$$$le, they were alarm'd
by the coming of Four Ve&s;&s;els into the
Harbour, in which were (they &s;ay) 200
Enemies. At fir&s;t, being encouraged by
Wine up to a Height above performing
any Thing, the General <HI>Moore</HI> re&s;olves
bravely to put on Board his Eight Ve&s;|&s;els
then riding in the Harbour, all their
Goods and Plunder, and with his few Men
about 500, Fight thro' the Enemy, and
&s;o come Home. But the Pillow, which
often lets out Heat to make way for
Caution, changed this his Re&s;olution;
So the next Day, having de&s;troyed as
many of his own Ships, and as much of
his War Stores and Provi&s;ions as the
ha&s;te they were in would allow, he re|treats
with &s;uch Caution and Di&s;patch,
that he lo&s;t not one Man by the Ene|my.</P>
<P>This
Expedition, whatever the Go|vernour
or General (if you plea&s;e) got
by it, brought a Debt on the Country
(be&s;ides the 2000$. fir&s;t rai&s;ed) o$ near
6000$. for the Payment of which ($word$
Security of the Country, as was &s;aid)
the A&s;&s;embly was called; they enq$$
into the Debt, bring in a Bill to rai&s;e
the S$m, con&s;ider of defending the South|ward
open to the Enemy; but of that the
<HI>Courtiers</HI> made but a $word$, even in the
Hou&s;e, and it yet is (as I hear) neglect|ed;
as al&s;o a Bill for Regulating Electi|ons
for the Future, for to the Breaches
of the Freeholders Rights, our p$$ent
Mi&s;eries they &s;aw were plainly owing,
<PB N="31" REF="72">
nor had tho&s;e Members, who &s;at by

Courage to oppo&s;e it; &s;o it pa&s;t the A&s;|&s;embly,
but being &s;ent up to the Gover|nour
in Council, it was there thrown out;
on which Fifteen Members (the A&s;&s;em|bly

re&s;olving no longer to cover with their
Authority the pernicious Practices of
the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> &s;ince nothing u&s;eful for the
Country could be obtained.</P>
<P>On this &s;everal of Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Favou|rites,

(and thereunto encourag'd, as is &s;aid)
headed the Rabble, and in a riotous
Manner, &s;ought after (threatning open|ly
to murther them) &s;everal Per&s;ons
thought the chief Oppo&s;ers and Mi$li|kers
of Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Management;
&s;ome they met with, Members of the

Merchants, and good Planters, Confi|ning,
Striking and Abu&s;ing them; and
for &s;everal Days continuing the&s;e Di&s;or|ders,
particularly breaking open a Hou&s;e
one Night on a poor Woman, and &s;o abu|&s;ing
her, that thereupon &s;he brought
forth a dead Child, who&s;e Scull, Arm,
and Back-bone was broken, and one
Eye forc'd out of its Head, as the Chyrur|gion,
who delivered her, depo&s;ed; but
this Violence not producing that Submi&s;|&s;ion
as was expected, that A&s;&s;embly was
Di&s;&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>Of this Riot, Complaint was &s;everal
times, while it lafted, made to Mr.
<HI>Moore;</HI> but he would not try to &s;uppre&s;s
it, nor, when in &s;ome Mea&s;ure over,
would he take any Care that they &s;hould
be Pro&s;ecuted; nor &s;o much as oblige
&s;uch of them, as <HI>L$ndgrave, Thomas Smith,</HI>
regularly demanded Security of the Peace
from, to give the &s;ame: Nay, one Mr.
<HI>Stephens,</HI> who was not in $own then,
but heard he was named by the $$ters
as one of the pro&s;cribed, going with &s;e|veral
who had been injur'd, to &s;ee how
Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> would receive them, was,
while $ting by Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> at his own
Table, by a Servant of Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s pull'd
backwards by the Hair of his Head, &s;truck
and wounded, and all only for his im|pertinent
Curio&s;ity, as he was told on
that Occa&s;ion. He de&s;ires the Gover|nour
to bind this his Servant to his good
Behaviour, and oblige him to appear to
an&s;wer this Action at the next Se&s;&s;ions,
but nothing was done. The now Gover|nour,
Sir <HI>Nathaniel John&s;on,</HI> was hereby
oblig'd to take on him the Government.
To him immediately the Injur'd apply'd
for Ju&s;tice, but are denied; and, tho'
the Grand Jury, a little after he took on
him his Office, after having receiv'd a
Record of the Riot from <HI>Landgrave Bel|linger</HI>
on his own View, and on Examina|tion
of Witne&s;&s;es and Depo&s;itions in re|lation
to the Outrage committed on the
Woman with Child, pre&s;ented it to the
Court as a great Grievance, that this
Riot was not looked into, nor the Rio|ters
pro&s;ecuted, Yet no Ju&s;tice again&s;t
them could be obtain'd, the Judge giving
for An&s;wer, <HI>It was before the Council his
Superiors.</HI> The pre&s;ent Governour, That
it was an Action done before his coming
to the Government, that he thought the
Time of pro&s;ecution $$p&s;ed, but would
take care the like &s;hould be no more.</P>
<P>Then a new A&s;&s;embly was called, and
at the Election for <HI>Berkeley</HI> and <HI>Craven.</HI>
County, (for in <HI>Colleton</HI> County there
was no Oppo&s;ition) the Violences in
Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Time, and all other illegal
Practices were with more Violence re|peated
and openly avow'd by the pre&s;ent
Governour and his Friends. On this <HI>Jo|&s;eph
Morton</HI> and <HI>Edmund Bellinger, Land|graves,</HI>
and Deputies of the Lords Pre|prietors,
all the other Members of <HI>Col|leton</HI>
County, and &s;everal of the greate&s;t

their Practices on one <HI>John Martin,</HI> to

content with Fifty, for that Favour, which
they would per&s;wade <HI>John Martin</HI> was
nece&s;&s;ary for him: But he thought this
too oppre&s;&s;ive, &s;o makes his E&s;cape, not

all which the &s;aid <HI>James Moore,</HI>
with heat oppo&s;ed, tho' the Judge
thought it rea&s;onable, and an&s;wer'd their

<P>To confirm and &s;trengthen the Truth

<P>ALtho the mi&s;erable E&s;tate of this Co|lony

your Lord&s;hips, from the Relation of <HI>John
A&s;h,</HI> E&s;&abque; who is fully intru&s;ted by us to
remon&s;trate our Grievances to your Lord|&s;hips;
yet we think our &s;elves exceeding|ly
bound and obliged to lay before you
what we think does concern your Lord|&s;hips
Honours, and the Peoples Rights and
Privileges: For if the Que&s;tion were a|bout
Matters of &s;mall moment, we &s;hould
be a&s;hamed to be importunate, and un|willing
to give the lea&s;t trouble to your
Lord&s;hips; but con&s;idering that the very
Foundation of our lawful Rights, hath of

more regard to their private Intere&s;t than

that it cannot &s;tand with the Duty we owe
to our &s;elves as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> or to our Po|&s;terity,
to &s;it down contented with le&s;s
than that which every Liege and Free|born
Subject of the Crown of <HI>England</HI>
may, and of right ought to have. And
therefore le&s;t our Silence &s;hould be pre|judicial
to &s;o important a Cau&s;e, we hum|bly
crave your Lord&s;hips leave, faithfully
and impartially to repre&s;ent to you the
great and notorious Violations and In|fringements
of our Laws and Liberties, un|der
which we &s;uffer.</P>
<P>We &s;hall go no further back, but date
the unhappy Cau&s;e and Grounds of our
Complaints from and immediately after
the Death of the late Governor <HI>Blake;</HI>
For the Choice and Election of a Governor
to &s;ucceed him being intru&s;ted with your
Lord&s;hips Deputys here, that Per&s;on a|mong&s;t
your &s;aid Deputys who made the
&s;tronge&s;t Party in the Coun&s;el, did carry
the Government by perverting the De&s;ign,
and breaking thro the Rules and In&s;truc|tions
agreed to by your Lord&s;hips for &s;uch
Election. And this manife&s;tly appear'd in
the unju&s;t Election of the late Governor
<HI>Moore,</HI> in prejudice of Landgrave <HI>Mor|ton</HI>'s
Title, who (after he was Elected by a
Majority of the Council then pre&s;ent) was
objected again&s;t by the &s;aid <HI>Moore,</HI> and ex|cluded
only becau&s;e he had accepted of
a Commi&s;&s;ion from the King: And as the
&s;aid <HI>Moore</HI> acquir'd and obtain'd the Go|vernment
of this Province by Fraud,
Flattery and trifling Exceptions, as afore|&s;aid;
&s;o has he endeavour'd ever &s;ince to
manage all things by ba&s;e and indirect
Methods, and crafty Projects, which made
his Government mi&s;erably unfortunate to
us all. The great per&s;onal Debts and Ne|ce&s;&s;ities
which the &s;aid late Governor
<HI>Moore</HI> had to &s;truggle with, may well be
thought to have put him upon, and promp|ted
him to de&s;igns to enrich him&s;elf at the
publick Peace and Welfare: And becau&s;e
the&s;e his De&s;igns cou'd not po&s;&s;ibly be
effected by him&s;elf alone, he knew very
well, that to engage the Council to his
Intere&s;t, and to have an A&s;&s;embly cho&s;en
to his liking, wou'd be the way effectually
to compleat and accompli&s;h his Ends and
Purpo&s;es: Thereupon 'tis manife&s;t, there
being Vacancies in the Council for Per&s;ons
fit, and worthy to repre&s;ent your Lord|&s;hips,
and your Lord&s;hips Plea&s;ure not be|ing
<PB N="34" REF="75">
then &s;ignified and known therein, tho&s;e
very Vacancies were &s;upplied by &s;uch Per|&s;ons
whom he beforehand knew, and was
well &s;atisfied and a&s;&s;ured would be for his
U&s;e and Purpo&s;e; and it's as well known,
that the Debates and Con&s;ultations of the
Council have all along been carried on,
and managed to the Ends afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>And pur&s;uant to his &s;aid De&s;ign, he did
by indirect Practices endeavor that &s;uch an
A&s;&s;embly might be cho&s;en as would be a|greeable
in their Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition
with his De&s;igns and Re&s;olutions: This
was to be brought about, tho the very
Foundation of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rights and Li|berties
were undermin'd and utterly &s;ub|verted
in the Attempt.</P>
<P>1. We therefore in the fir&s;t place humbly
repre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hips, and we do
a&s;&s;ert and maintain, That it is one of the
fundamental Rights and unque&s;tionable
Privileges belonging to <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> that
all Elections of their Repre&s;entatives to
&s;erve in Parliament ought to be free and
indifferent, without any Prayer or Com|mandment
to the contrary; and that no A|lien
born out of the Allegiance of the
Crown of <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s he be otherwi&s;e
e&s;pecially qualify'd, ought to elect for, or
be elected to &s;erve as a Member of A&s;|&s;embly;
all which notwith&s;tanding, at the
Election of Members of A&s;&s;embly to &s;erve
for <HI>Berkly</HI> County made in the Month of
<HI>November,</HI> 1701. there were &s;everal great
Abu&s;es made and committed, again&s;t the
Ancient U&s;ages and Cu&s;toms of this Pro|vince,
and contrary to Law, particularly
an Act intitul'd, <HI>An Act for Regulating E|lections,</HI>
&amp;c. and to the great Di&s;&s;atisfac|tion,
and manife&s;t Prejudice of the &s;everal
Inhabitants of this Province, Candidates
and others. For &s;o it was, may it plea&s;e
your Lord&s;hips, that at the &s;aid Election,
much Threatnings, many Intreaties, and
other unju&s;tifiable Actions were made u&s;e of,
and illegal and unqualify'd Votes given in
to the Sheriff, and by him receiv'd and re|turn'd,
particularly the Votes of very many
unqualified Alien&punc; were taken and enter$d,
the Votes of &s;everal Members of the Coun|cil
were filed and receiv'd, a great number
of Servants, and poor and indigent Per&s;ons,
voted promi&s;cuou&s;ly with their Ma&s;ters and
Creditors, as al&s;o &s;everal free <HI>Negroes</HI> were
receiv'd, and taken for as good Electors as
the be&s;t Freeholders in the Province. So
that we leave it with your Lord&s;hips to
judg, whether admitting Aliens, Strangers,
Servants, Negroes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as good and quali|fied
Voters, can be thought any ways agree|able
to King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Patent to your Lord|&s;hips,
or the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution of Go|vernment.</P>
<P>II. We repre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hips,
that when at the meeting of the A&s;&s;embly,
divers Candidates, by Petition by them ex|hibited,
pray'd to be heard again&s;t the
Return of the Sheriff for <HI>Berkly</HI> County of
the Election afore&s;aid, and in&s;i&s;ted upon
their Right, and that the Sheriff's Return
was fal&s;e and illegal; and the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly,
the better and more impartially to inquire
into the ill Practices at the &s;aid Election,
did fir&s;t of all re&s;olve to begin upon Pri|vileges
and Elections, that the late Go|vernor
<HI>Moore,</HI> to prevent &s;uch Inquiry, did
&s;everal times prorogue the &s;aid A&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>III. That when the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly were
at la&s;t &s;uffer'd to &s;it, the Inquiry and Ex|amination
into the Sheriff's Return of the
la&s;t Election was ob&s;tructed, and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
prevented, by &s;etting on foot an ill|laid
De&s;ign of rai&s;ing Forces to attaque St.
<HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P>IV. That notwith&s;tanding your Lord&s;hips
repeated Commands to your Deputies to
procure a good Regulation of the <HI>Indian</HI>
Trade, on which our friendly Corre&s;pon|dence
with all our Neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI>
and the Peace and Safety of this Colony
chiefly depends, yet the &s;aid late Governor
<HI>Moore</HI> has been by his Artifices, the chief
(if not the only) occa&s;ion of ob&s;tructing
the &s;ame, de&s;igning nothing le&s;s than in|gro&s;&s;ing
the &s;ame for him&s;elf and Accom|plices;
having already almo&s;t utterly r$|$$'d
the Trade for Skins and F$rs (where|by
we held our chief Corre&s;pondence with
<HI>England</HI>) and turn'd it into a Trade of
<HI>Indian</HI> catching or Slave-making, whereby
the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> of us are
already involv'd in Blood and Confu&s;ion;
a Trade &s;o odious and abominable, that
every other Colony in <HI>America</HI> (altho they
have equal Temptation) abhor to follow.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="76">
V. That the &s;aid late Governor <HI>Moore</HI>
did grant Commi&s;&s;ions to <HI>Anthony Dod&s;|worth,
Robert Mackoone</HI> and others, to &s;et
upon, a&s;&s;ault, kill, de&s;troy, and take
Captive as many <HI>Indians</HI> as they po&s;&s;ible
could, the Profit and Produce of which
<HI>Indian</HI> Slaves were turn'd to his private u&s;e;
whereas &s;uch Undertakings, unju&s;t and bar|barous
in them&s;elves, will in all probability
draw upon us an <HI>Indian</HI> War, with all the
dreadful Con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>VI. We repre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hips,
that the late unfortunate, ill-contrived,
and wor&s;e-managed Expedition again&s;t
<HI>St. Augu&s;tine,</HI> was principally &s;et on foot
by the &s;aid late Governor and his Adhe|rents;
and that if any Per&s;on in the &s;aid
late A&s;&s;embly undertook to &s;peak again&s;t
it, and to &s;hew how unfit and unable we
were at that time for &s;uch an Attempt, he
was pre&s;ently look'd upon by them as an
Enemy and Traitor to his Country, and
reviled and affronted in the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly,
altho the true De&s;ign of the Expedition
was no other than catching and making
Slaves of <HI>Indians</HI> for private Advantage,
and improveri&s;hing the Country. And this
will plainly appear, when your Lord&s;hips
know that your Country is brought more
in Debt at this time, and upon this occa|&s;ion,
than ever &s;ince its fir&s;t Settlement,
if we put all the Debts we have owed
together. And that the Expedition was
to enrich them&s;elves, will appear particu|larly,
becau&s;e what&s;oever Booty, as rich
Silks, great Quantity of Church-Plate,
with a great many other co&s;tly Church.
Ornaments and Uten&s;ils taken by our Sol|diers
at <HI>St. Augu&s;tine,</HI> are now detained
in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid late Gover|nor
and his Officers, contrary to an Act of
A&s;&s;embly made, for an equal Divi&s;ion of
the &s;ame among the Soldiers.</P>
<P>VII. That the &s;aid late Governor would
have had the &s;aid Expedition again&s;t <HI>St.
Augu&s;tine</HI> begun and undertaken before the
War with <HI>Spain</HI> was proclaimed here; and
this was vehemently urged by his Intere&s;t
in the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly; but with much ado,
being put to the Vote, was carried in the
Negative. And when at la&s;t the Expe|dition
was ordered, the Management of
the &s;aid late Governor was &s;uch in all it.
Steps, particularly in relation to his &s;hame|ful
Retreat, and burning the Country's
Ve&s;&s;els, that we are a&s;hamed to mention
the &s;ame, till we have a Free A&s;&s;embly,
before which the matter may&punc; be fairly
tried, which is the only thing the &s;aid
late Governor and his Adherents are mo&s;t
afraid of.</P>
<P>VIII. That in the &s;aid late A&s;&s;embly,
the Con&s;titutions &s;ent by Major <HI>Daniel</HI>
were offer'd for their pa&s;&s;ing, urg'd with
great Strength of Rea&s;on for to have
them pa&s;s'd by Mr. <HI>A&s;h;</HI> but they were
oppo&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Trott,</HI> Mr. <HI>Howes,</HI> and
others the &s;aid Governor's Creatures, and
&s;everal reflecting Words u&s;ed by the &s;aid
<HI>T$ott</HI> and <HI>Howes</HI> concerning them, expo|&s;ing
the Con&s;titutions as ridiculous and
void in them&s;elves; thereby endeavouring
(notwith&s;tanding your Lord&s;hips care of
us) to keep the People in an un&s;ettled
Condition, that from time to time they
might the more ea&s;ily be impo&s;ed on by
them.</P>
<P>IX. That after the People returned
from <HI>St. Augu&s;tine,</HI> the time for the &s;aid
A&s;&s;embly to meet, according to the la&s;t
Prorogation, was ju&s;t at hand; when
they met, they went upon the Inquiry of
the Charges the Country had been at in
the &s;aid Expedition, and were upon De|bate
for the finding out ways and means
for the Payment of the Country's Debts,
for &s;ecuring the Colony, for the &s;ettling
of Elections for the future, and for grant|ing
as much Freedom to the <HI>French</HI> and
other Aliens as could be granted by the
A&s;&s;embly, or the <HI>French</HI> rea&s;onably expect.
<HI>A Bill for the better Regulating Elections,</HI>
pa&s;&s;ed the Lower Hou&s;e twice, and was
&s;ent up to the &s;aid Governor and Coun|cil,
where it was rejected without &s;o much
as a Conference; upon which &s;everal of
the Members, jealous of their Privilege,
and being &s;o ordered by tho&s;e that &s;ent
them, le$t the Hou&s;e, $ad entr$ng their
Prote&s;tation, a Copy of which Mr. <HI>A&s;h</HI>
has to &s;hew your Lord&s;hips, and to which
we refer you.</P>
<P>X. But what we have yet to repre&s;ent
to your Lord&s;hips, makes very deep $m|pre&s;&s;ions
on us, and is not to be thought
on by us, but with the greate&s;t Regret and
Concern. For altho the Members of the
late A&s;&s;embly, who prote&s;ted and did leave
<PB N="36" REF="77">
the Hou&s;e as afore&s;aid (hoping that the
next day they might find things in better
order, and &s;ome temperating means found
out, which might have given &s;ome tole|rable
A&s;&s;urance of having their Libertys
&s;ecured) went every one of them to the
Hou&s;e on the morrow, and frankly offered
to &s;it longer, if the re&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly
would join with them to a&s;&s;ert their
Rights; but in&s;tead of any Compliance,
they were abus'd, revil'd, and treated
with the mo&s;t reflecting Language imagi|nable,
very unbecoming an A&s;&s;embly.
And we further repre&s;ent to your Lord|&s;hips,
that in a day or two after &s;uch
Abu&s;e given them in the Hou&s;e, &s;everal
of the &s;aid Members, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;aid <HI>John
A&s;h,</HI> E&s;&abque; Landgrave <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> and
others, were a&s;&s;aulted and &s;et upon in
the open Street, without any Provocation
or Affront by them given or offered. The
&s;aid <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> was &s;et upon by Lieute|nant
Colonel <HI>George Dearsby,</HI> who with his
Sword drawn, and the Point held at the
&s;aid <HI>Smith</HI>'s Belly, &s;wore he would kill
him, and if he had not been prevented,
would have done the &s;aid <HI>Smith</HI> &s;ome con|&s;iderable
mi&s;chief, to the endangering of
his Life. The &s;aid <HI>John A&s;h</HI> walking along
the Street, was a&s;&s;aulted by a rude, drun|ken,
ungovernable Rabble, headed, en|couraged
and abetted by the &s;aid <HI>Dearsby,
Thomas Dalton, Nicholas Nary,</HI> and other
Per&s;ons, Inhabitants, who &s;et upon the
&s;aid <HI>A&s;h,</HI> u&s;ed him villanou&s;ly and barba|rou&s;ly:
and that Evening, when he the
&s;aid <HI>A&s;h</HI> was retired into a Friend's Cham|ber
for Security, the &s;ame armed Multi|tude
came to the Hou&s;e where the &s;aid
<HI>A&s;h</HI> was, and demanded him down, a&s;&s;u|ring
him at the &s;ame time that they
would do him no hurt, but only wanted
to di&s;cour&s;e with him: upon which A&s;&s;u|rance
he came down to them; who not|with&s;tanding,
being encouraged and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
by Captain <HI>Rhett</HI> and others, drew
him by Force and Violence on board his
the &s;aid <HI>Rhett</HI>'s Ship, reviling and threat|ning
of him as they drag'd him along;
and having gotten him on board the &s;aid
<HI>Rhett</HI>'s Ship, they &s;ometimes told him
they would carry him to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and at
other times threatned to hang him, or
leave him on &s;ome remote I&s;land.</P>
<P>XI. That the &s;aid late Governor had
the &s;ame way (immediately before the Riot
began) treated a great many of the Per|&s;ons
concerned therein, and u&s;ed &s;uch
Expre&s;&s;ions to them, as gave them, next
their Drink, the greate&s;t Encouragements
for what they acted, by telling them that
the prote&s;ting Members would bring the
People on their Heads for neglecting to
pay the Country's Debts, which if it
&s;hould happen he knew not who could
blame them; in the mean time he thank'd
them for their clo&s;e Adherence to him in
all his Concerns. And after the Riot be|gan
(of part of which he was an Eye|witne&s;s)
having fir&s;t drank with &s;ome of
them, he withdrew him&s;elf out of the
way, thereby giving them greater Incou|ragement
to proceed in their Tumultuous
Practices, and by his Example and Ab&s;ence
di&s;couraging the inferior Officers from
executing their Duty.</P>
<P>XII. That whil&s;t the &s;aid Riot conti|nued,
which was four or five Days, Land|grave
<HI>Edmond Bellinger,</HI> who was a Ju&s;tice
of the Peace, there being no other to be
&s;een that under&s;tood his Office, went our
to &s;uppre&s;s and record the afore&s;aid Riot;
but the Rioters no &s;ooner &s;aw him, than
they called him all the opprobrious Names
they could think of, and the &s;aid <HI>Rhett</HI>
came up to him and &s;truck him over the
Head with his Cane, and continued beating
and &s;tricking of him for a con&s;iderable
time, as by the &s;aid Record herewith
&s;ent your Lord&s;hips will more fully ap|pear.</P>
<P>XIII. That the &s;aid Rioters beat and
abu&s;ed Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Boone,</HI> and put him in
danger and fear of his Life, without any
Provocation by him given or offered; and
that for four or five days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and
at other times after, the &s;aid Rioters un|u&s;ually
armed and weapon'd to the great
terror of the People, frightned and ter|rified
Per&s;ons, that they were forced
to leave the Town, their Affairs and
Intere&s;ts expo&s;ed to the Mercy of a licen|tious
Rabble.</P>
<P>XIV. That &s;ome of the &s;aid Rioters,
whil&s;t the Riot was at the Church, went
one night to the Hou&s;e of <HI>John Smith,</HI> a
Butcher in <HI>Charles-Town;</HI> and there being
a Woman big with Child in the &s;aid
<PB N="37" REF="78">
Hou&s;e, they with Force opened the Door,
threw her down, and otherwi&s;e mi&s;u&s;ed
her, that &s;he brought forth a dead Child,
with the Back and Skullbroken.</P>
<P>XV. That the &s;aid <HI>John A&s;h, Thomas
Smith, James Byres, Jo&s;eph Boone,</HI> and
others, complained to the &s;aid late Go|vernor
and his Council, &s;etting forth the
Abu&s;es and barbarous U&s;ages they had met
withal from the afore&s;aid Rioters, and the
Danger they were yet in, for that the
&s;aid Rioters were &s;till in Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
they met with no other Satisfaction from
them, than that the &s;aid late Governor
&s;hifted off the matter, by &s;aying it was a
bu&s;ine&s;s fit for a Ju&s;tice of Peace; and
being asked by <HI>James Byres,</HI> whether or
not he look'd on him&s;elf, as Governor,
obliged to keep the Peace of the Province?
he replied, that was a Que&s;tion he was
not obliged to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>XVI. That before the next Se&s;&s;ions of
the Peace holden for the &s;aid Province,
Sir <HI>Nathaniel John&s;on</HI> was proclaimed, and
took upon him the Government, and then
Mr. <HI>Trott</HI> had a Commi&s;&s;ion to be Judg,
and the &s;aid late Governor was made
Attorny General, &s;o that it was in vain to
expect any Relief or Remedy here: How|ever,
the &s;aid <HI>Edmond Bellinger</HI> did what
in him lay to have the &s;aid Riot inquired
into, gave in the Record thereof to the
Bench, and &s;ome of the Grand Jury urged
to have it pre&s;ented, but to no purpo&s;e,
for &s;ome of the Abetters of the Rioters
being of the Jury, and making Friends
there, &s;topt the whole Proceeding.</P>
<P>XVII. We further repre&s;ent to your
Lord&s;hips, that contrary to the Rights and
Privileges which we ought to enjoy, the
la&s;t Election of Members to &s;erve for
<HI>Berkly</HI> County, was managed with greater
Inju&s;tice to the Freemen of this Province
than the former: For at this la&s;t Election,
Jews, Strangers, Sailors, Servants, Negroes,
and almo&s;t every <HI>French</HI> Man in <HI>Craven</HI> and
<HI>Berkly</HI> County came down to elect, and
their Votes were taken, and the Per&s;ons
by them votes for, were returned by the
Sheriff, to the manife&s;t wrong and preju|dice
of other Candidates.</P>
<P>Things &s;tanding with us, as is before
faithfully repre&s;ented to your Lord&s;hips,
we thought it our Duty, &s;ince we can
have no Remedy or Relief in <HI>Carolina,</HI> to
apply our &s;elves to your Lord&s;hips, who&s;e
Paternal Care and Concern for us, we
que&s;tion not, will be &s;ignally evidenced and
extended unto us upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, and
in &s;uch extremities: For when once our
Lawful Rights and Privileges are denied
us, when Foreigners and Strangers &s;hall
make our Laws, when we can have no
Protection from tho&s;e who ought, and
are intru&s;ted by your Lord&s;hips, to &s;ee
the Laws executed; when, in a word,
Force is made the Arbiter of all Diffe|rences,
and all things reduced to a State
of Confu&s;ion, it is &s;urely a time, if ever
there be one, for a People to complain:
and mi&s;erable are tho&s;e Subjects, who
mu&s;t be hectored and domineered over by
their Fellow-Subjects, even by tho&s;e who
have hardly any other way to &s;upport
their decayed Fortunes but at the Expence
of the Publick. It may be worth your
Lord&s;hips while to reflect what might have
been the occa&s;ion, that &s;o few Per&s;ons of
Intere&s;t, Honour and Education, come
among&s;t us, and that good People go,
and are going from us, when the Colony
is in a thriving Condition; certainly it is
becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberties, that all her
Maje&s;ty's Subjects in all other Places in her
Dominions ju&s;tly claim&punc; are notoriou&s;ly
trampled on, to the great Di&s;couragement
of Settlers. As to the <HI>French,</HI> they have
hitherto lived peaceably, and with due
Encouragement among&s;t us; but when we
&s;ee and con&s;ider, that they are often made
Tools of, and impo&s;ed upon, and per&s;ua|ded
by ill-de&s;igning Per&s;ons here, to carry
on &s;ini&s;ter De&s;igns to the general Di&s;ad|vantage
of the Country, and how ea&s;ily
they are drawn into Error
s, by rea&s;on
they have not a right under&s;tanding of
our Language, and are ignorant of our
Laws, we can't imagine that we do them
any hurt, by making good and whole&s;om
Laws for us and them, &s;ince we oblige
them by no other Laws what&s;oever, or
upon any account, than what we our &s;elves
are obliged by, and live under. What
then have we to entreat for and pray of
your Lord&s;hips? Nothing le&s;s, than that
your Lord&s;hips would be plea&s;ed to take
all and &s;ingular the Premi&s;es into your
<PB N="38" REF="79">
&s;erious Con&s;iderations, to &s;ettle and e&s;ta|bli&s;h
the Peace of this Colony on &s;uch a
&s;ure Foundation, that it may be beyond
the Wit and Malice, and out of the power
of ill-de&s;igning Men to di&s;turb it for the
time to come. And la&s;tly, we on behalf
of our &s;elves and her Maje&s;ty's Liege
Subjects, Inhabitants of this Province, do
more e&s;pecially pray and de&s;ire your Lord|&s;hips,
that you would be plea&s;ed to give
Directions for calling a Free General A&s;|&s;embly,
which will undoubedly a&s;&s;i&s;t
your Lord&s;hips to redre&s;s and remove the
Grievances afore&s;aid, &s;ettle the Peace and
Pro&s;perity of this Colony, and procure
that chearful Obedience which ought to
be rendred to your Lord&s;hips, under her
pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; carrying with it the Offer
of our Fortunes and be&s;t Endeavours for
her Maje&s;ty's and your Lord&s;hips Honors,
as a real Te&s;timony of our Thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Lord&s;hips,</P>
<P>ALL the Complaints and Grievances
above expre&s;t, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed
to be per&s;onally known, and proveable
by every of us the Sub&s;cribers of the
&s;ame (tho there be none of us, but to
our &s;ad Experience can witne&s;s too many
of them) but we make no doubt, when
your Lord&s;hips &s;hall order &s;uch a Method
for Enquiry into the Truth of the Premi&s;es,
as may be free, without partiality and
brow-beating of the Per&s;ons to be exa|mined
thereon, they will be made as
evident, as that the Sun at Noon &s;hines in
our Hemi&s;phere.</P>
<CLOSER>That your Lord&s;hips may long and pro&s;pe|rou&s;ly

An Act for the more effectual Pre&s;ervation of the Government of
this Province, by requiring all Per&s;ons that &s;hall hereafter be
cho&s;en Members of the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, and &s;it in
the &s;ame, to take the Oaths and &s;ub&s;cribe the Declaration ap|pointed
by this Act; and to conform to the Religious Wor&s;hip in
this Province, according to the Church of England; and to
receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the

<P>AS nothing is more contrary to the

&s;uch Per&s;on after his Election, and before

forth to Your Lord&s;hips the undue Elec|tion
of the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly; and be&s;ides
the heavy Taxes they have laid on Us,
and the &s;evere Impo&s;itions on Trade (the
Con&s;equences of the vain Attempt on St.
<HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>) we are more particularly to
make our Complaints to Your Lord&s;hips,
of the great and unparallel'd Breach they
have made in the Charter, granted Your
Lord&s;hips by K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. and of our
Privileges therein contained. The A&s;&s;em|bly
having been prorogued to the 10<HI>th</HI> of
<HI>May;</HI> it was however called together by
Proclamation, to &s;it the 6<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April:</HI>
And having continued together &s;even or
eight Days, with little or no Bu&s;ine&s;s be|fore
them (to the great &s;urprize of the
generality of the People) on a &s;udden,
without any previous Notice, on the 4<HI>th</HI>
of <HI>May</HI> a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e
(the Copy whereof We have herewith
&s;ent your Lord&s;hips) to exclude by a Sa|cramental
Te&s;t all Di&s;&s;enters from &s;itting
in the Commons Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly. This
Bill was hurried on &s;o, that on the 6<HI>th</HI> it
pa&s;t the Hou&s;e; there being, after all their
Endeavours, but Twelve for it, and Ele|ven
again&s;t it; whereof &s;everal were
Members of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> In
the Upper Hou&s;e, tho it pa&s;t with le&s;s
Oppo&s;ition, yet the Landgrave <HI>Jo&s;eph Mor|ton</HI>
was deny'd the liberty of Entring his
Rea&s;ons for his Di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>We are unable (my Lords) to de&s;cribe
the Con&s;ternation of the Generality of the
People at the&s;e violent Proceedings: All
moderate Per&s;ons are extreamly di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied,
and the Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves under
the la&s;t degree of Confu&s;ion and Di&s;con|tent;
de&s;iring, with Grief of Heart, that
Your Lord&s;hips, in your Great Wi&s;dom
and Goodne&s;s, will take Their pre&s;ent
Condition into Your &s;erious Con&s;idera|tions,
and order a Repeal of the afore|&s;aid
Act, &s;o prejudicial to their Liberties;
for which they humbly offer to Your
Lord&s;hips the&s;e following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>1. K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, having by
His Charter to Your Lord&s;hips, given His
Subjects, the Freemen and Freeholders of
this Province, by them&s;elves or their De|legates,
the privilege of Advi&s;ing and Con|&s;enting
with Your Lord&s;hips, to all &s;uch
Laws as &s;hall be made here, and the Di&s;|&s;enters
being a very large part of the
Freemen, and Freeholders, and incoura|ged
to tran&s;port them&s;elves, Families, and
<PB N="42" REF="83">
E&s;tates, hither by the &s;aid Privileges, are
notwith&s;tanding excluded from the Pri|vilege
of being Delegates, or Repre&s;en|tatives
of the People in their A&s;&s;emblies
by the &s;aid Act, to the manife&s;t Violation
of the Charter.</P>
<P>2. The Di&s;&s;enters, in all the re&s;t of Her
Maje&s;ty's Governments in <HI>America,</HI> being
by no Laws excluded from being cho&s;en
into A&s;&s;emblys in the re&s;pective Colonys;
and the Di&s;&s;enters here, having a Right
thereunto in this Government, not only as
Freemen, but by the Conce&s;&s;ions in the
Charter, have the greater Rea&s;on to com|plain
of their pre&s;ent Sufferings.</P>
<P>3. We cannot too feelingly a&s;&s;ure your
Lord&s;hips, that the &s;aid Act tends not
only to the great Prejudice, and utter
Di&s;couragement of her Maje&s;ty's good
Subjects, the Di&s;&s;enters here, in rending
from them that fundamental Privilege,
which they and their Ance&s;tors have peace|ably
enjoy'd ever &s;ince the fir&s;t Settlement
of this Colony; but will al&s;o be a very
great Di&s;couragement to them in their &s;e|veral

<HEAD>(Numb. 8.)
The Letter of Mrs. Blake, Widow of the late Governor, to
the Lords Proprietors.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it plea&s;e your Lord&s;hips,</OPENER>
<P>THE Share my Son has the Honour to
have with your Lord&s;hips in the Pro|priety
of this Province, together with the
publick Concern I have for the Propriety
thereof, oblige me at this time to give you
this Trouble, and to lay before your
Lord&s;hips a &s;hort Repre&s;entation of the
many Grievances the People are oppre&s;&s;ed
with.</P>
<P>The precipitate and fatal Undertaking
again&s;t St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> and the Con&s;equen|ces
thereof, carried on by a Party, have in|volved
the Country in a Debt of about
10000l. to the Ruin of our Trade, the
To&s;s of our Credit abroad, and infinite
Di&s;&s;atisfactions at home.</P>
<P>Towards Satisfaction of which Debt, an
Act was contriv'd for forcing the Currency
of Bills of Credit to the value of 6000l.
The&s;e Bills were declar'd Current in all Pay|ments,
and the Re&s;u&s;er of them finable in
double the value of the Sum refus'd; where|by
the bolde&s;t Stroke has been given to
the Property of the Settlers in this Pro|vince
that ever was known in any Country,
not govern'd by arbitrary Power: And the
bad Con&s;equences of this forced Currency,
in relation to Trade with Strangers, are &s;o
great, that they can &s;carcely be expre&s;&s;ed,
without being more prolix than the
Bounds of a Letter can allow. Your
Lord&s;hips very well know, that if the
Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> did not conceive &s;uch
a Method de&s;tructive of the Peoples Pro|perty,
and of the utmo&s;t Danger to Com|merce,
they could not need any Projection
of Ways and Means, for rai&s;ing of what
Mony the Government's Affairs do require;
but there has nothing of this been weigh'd
by your Lord&s;hips Deputies here, or by
the packed Members of our Commons
Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly: Be&s;ides all this, the
<PB N="43" REF="84">
People are not &s;atisfied how many Bills are
truly &s;ent abroad; and the great Concern
Mr. <HI>James Smith,</HI> alias <HI>Serureir</HI> (who
cheated the <HI>Scots</HI> Company of a con&s;ide|rable
Sum of Mony, and with his Keeper
made his E&s;cape from <HI>London</HI> hither) had
in this Contrivance, doth give a Jealou&s;y
of indirect Practices therein &s;o prevalent
among the People, as mu&s;t end in Confu|&s;ion
and Di&s;order.</P>
<P>Neither have they &s;topt here, but to
our pre&s;ent Amazement, and the Increa&s;e
of our Fears of their evil De&s;igns for the
future, they have proceeded to pa&s;s an
Act for the Exclu&s;ion of all Di&s;&s;enters from
their Right to &s;it in the Commons Hou&s;e
of A&s;&s;embly, and obliging them to take
the Sacrament according to the Rites of the
Church of <HI>England;</HI> in the &s;ame Act in|&s;erting
a Clau&s;e, to qualify the mo&s;t pro|$$igate
of them&s;elves for Admi&s;&s;ion into
A&s;&s;emblies by a declaratory Oath, altho
they never take the Sacrament: This Act
(after much underhand Dealing) was pa&s;|&s;ed
in a hurry, and carried by Twelve on|ly
again&s;t Eleven, the above Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI>
who has neither Intere&s;t nor Reputation,
being one of the Number of the Twelve.</P>
<P>By the Artifices of the&s;e Men, the ho|ne&s;t
and well-meaning People have been
all along &s;et again&s;t your Lord&s;hips Con&s;ti|tutions;
they therefore &s;eeing, that by
pa&s;&s;ing of them, their indirect and arbi|trary
Proceedings would be in a great mea|&s;ure
prevented: But now the Eyes of the
People are &s;omewhat more opened, and
they begin to be &s;en&s;ible of the Delu&s;ions
and Oppre&s;&s;ions they have been involved
in, your Deputies decline offering the
Con&s;titutions to the People, altho your
Lord&s;hips (as I am well informed) have
often of late commanded it of them.</P>
<P>I know there has already been made to
your Lord&s;hips, by Mr. <HI>John A&s;h,</HI> a Repre|&s;entation
of the People's Sufferings here;
and that there will be at this time, and up|on
this Occa&s;ion, a farther Account of
the&s;e Affairs &s;ent your Lord&s;hips by many
of the good People in the behalf of them|&s;elves
and others, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected
with the Lo&s;s of the&s;e Privileges, which
by King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Charter to your Lord|&s;hips,
has been the Right and U&s;age of
their Ance&s;tors and them&s;elves, ever &s;ince
the fir&s;t Settlement of the Province: And
my earne&s;t Reque&s;t to your Lord&s;hips is,
That in your great Wi&s;dom, you would be
plea&s;ed to give them &s;uch a Hearing and
&s;peedy Redre&s;s, as may conduce mo&s;t to
the Glory of God, your Lord&s;hips Ho|nour,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am glad to &s;ee you in the Li&s;t among&s;t
other Learned and Worthy Divines,
and other Per&s;ons of the Society for the
Propagation of the Go&s;pel in Foreign
Parts; con&s;idering the Acquaintance I
had with you at the Free-School in <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter,</HI>
and afterwards at <HI>Cambridge</HI> whil&s;t
we were Contemporaries together there.
I'm the more embolden'd and encoura|ged
humbly to reque&s;t of you, that you'll
afford me your be&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance in that
Honourable and Reverend Society, in
the unju&s;t and illegal Oppre&s;&s;ion I do at
the pre&s;ent undergo, in this remote Cor|ner
of the World. The true &s;tate of my
Ca&s;e being &s;ummarily comprized in my
enclo&s;ed Petition to the Board of our
Lords Proprietors, I &s;ent the &s;ame Peti|tion

<HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Granville</HI> our <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the
re&s;t of the Lords Proprietors of this Pro|vince.
My Objections again&s;t a late Act
pa&s;&s;ed here, were not in that; &s;o I de&s;ire
the Favour of you to peru&s;e this, to the
end you may make the be&s;t Advantage
of it for me you can, at your Honoura|ble
and Reverend Society. I have writ
to one Mr. <HI>George Franklin,</HI> an Apothe|cary
in <HI>Long-Lane,</HI> over-again&s;t the <HI>Char|ter-Hou&s;e</HI>
Street, to wait upon you for it,
that he may pre&s;ent it to our Lords
Proprietors, for fear this War time my
former may have mi&s;carried: He was
an <HI>Eaton</HI> Scholar, who&s;e Father was a
Doctor of Phy&s;ick at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and of
<HI>Coll. Camb.</HI> He lived here 17 Years, and
was my Churchwarden two Years: He
will &s;atisfy your Curio&s;ity in any Que|&s;tions
about me, or this Countrey. I
wrote in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t to my Lord of
<HI>London,</HI> Mr. <HI>Harper</HI> at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Palace,
and to &s;ome other Friends of mine in
<HI>London,</HI> about this Bu&s;ine&s;s, but have as
yet received no An&s;wer to my Letters.
I intreat you to be a Friend to me and
and my Church in your Honourable So|ciety.
I'm known to the Two Archbi|&s;hops,
Sir <HI>George Wheeler,</HI> Dr. <HI>Beveridge,</HI>
Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> and to &s;ome others of the
Worthy Members of the Society, who
I hope will be an <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> to me in my
oppre&s;s'd Innocence. His Grace of <HI>Can|terbury</HI>
was plea&s;ed at my leaving <HI>Eng|land</HI>
(which was above 5 Years &s;ince)

him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me and my Church here, to
the be&s;t of his Power: I beg the Favour
of you to give my humble Duty to his
Grace, and to be a Remembrancer of
me to him, as you have an Opportuni|ty,
I was per&s;onally recommended to
his Favour, by Dr. <HI>Comber,</HI> the late Dean
of <HI>Durham</HI> (of Sacred Memory) who
knew me very well at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and
<HI>Durham.</HI> I took the Oath at <HI>Monmoutl$</HI>
in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> to King <HI>William;</HI> and after
that, his Grace of <HI>York</HI> was plea&s;ed to
vouch&s;afe me many Favours, whil&s;t I
&s;upply'd that Church, and lived in his
Dioce&s;e; which was about Two Years.
I craved his Ble&s;&s;ing and Prayers in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
at my Leaving <HI>England;</HI> he was
plea&s;ed to be very kind to me, and I
&s;uppo&s;e hath not yet forgot me. The
Enclo&s;ed will &s;atisfy all the Friends
I can make in your Worthy Society,
that I do &s;tand in need of their Patro|nage
and be&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I being Married &s;ince my Arrival here,
and having Three &s;mall Children, I can|not
as yet &s;ee <HI>England;</HI> tho the pre&s;ent
Circum&s;tances of this once I louri&s;hing

<P><HI>Our la&s;t A&s;&s;embly (being compo&s;ed of ma|ny
Men of very loo&s;e and corrupt Morals)
did make &s;ome very odd and unju&s;t $fiable

bere&s;t, mo&s;t Numerous, and Riche&s;t People of
this Province; &s;ome Men that are now in
Power, have for that Rea&s;on been plea&s;ed to
be my Enemies.</HI> Tho' I ble&s;s God, I have
&s;ome very good Friends here, and I do
&s;till Preach in my Church Twice every
Lord's-Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' our pre&s;ent Pow|ers
have dealt as bad with me, as <HI>Pha|raoh</HI>
dealt with the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> that took
away their Straw, yet required their full
Tale of Bricks: So the pre&s;ent Powers
here have unju&s;tly robb'd me of my
Legal Rights; and yet not only require
the full Tale of Sermons and Service
from me, but do multiply my Sermons
and Service, by appointing many Fa&s;t-Days
at this time that we are threatned
with an Inva&s;ion from the publick Ene|mies
of the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> The
Ship that brings you the&s;e Papers, doth
carry to <HI>England</HI> a young Clergyman,
call'd Mr. <HI>Thomas;</HI> he was &s;ent hither by
my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and the So|ciety
for Propagating the Go&s;pel in Fo|reign
Parts, to labour in the Conver&s;ion
of a Nation of our <HI>Indians,</HI> call'd the
<HI>Yamo&s;es,</HI> who revolted from the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
to us. He was recommended to me by
his Reverence Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> for that Work:
The <HI>Indians</HI> being <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Chri|&s;tians,
de&s;ired a Prie&s;t among&s;t them,
and he came upon the Letters of Cap|tain
<HI>Nairne</HI> and Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> to the Bi|&s;hop
of <HI>London,</HI> for a Mini&s;ter for them.
Upon his Arrival here he did not obey
his Mi&s;&s;ion and Orders at home, but
di&s;plac'd one Mr. <HI>Kendall,</HI> tho invited
into this Colony by &s;everal Letters
from his Church at <HI>Bermudas,</HI> call'd
St. <HI>George</HI>'s, where he had been &s;everal
Years &s;ettled: Poor Mr. <HI>Kendall</HI> went
di&s;tracted upon his ill u&s;age here by &s;ome
Great Ones on this Young Man's ac|count,
and he and his Wife forc'd out
of the Province, and I bear that he's
&s;ince dead. A young Deacon, one Mr
<HI>Wormel,</HI> (who&s;e Father was a Con$$ater
of St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s) I found here, they
us'd him &s;o ill, that he al&s;o dy'd di&s;tract|ed.
Mr <HI>Corb$$$</HI> an Acquaintance and
Neighbour of mine in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI>
when I was Curate to Dr. <HI>Crawford,</HI> and
Mr $word$ of <HI>$word$,</HI> came $word$ by
chance, and I got him &s;ettled in a Con|gregation
at <HI>Goo&s;creek,</HI> where in half a
Year they cau&s;ele&s;ly quarrel'd with him,
(tho he de&s;ired none of their Money)
and forced him out of the Colony; who
is &s;ince dead at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI>
Thus hath this Colony made Three E|pi&s;copally-ordained
Mini&s;ters, within
le&s;s than Five Years, the Emblems of all
Mi&s;ery, and by fal&s;e Calumnies and
Slanders, and malicious and fal&s;e Accu|&s;ations,
made them mo&s;t ba&s;e in the eyes
of all good Chri&s;tians. Their Charge
again&s;t me, and Cen&s;ure and Ordinance
thereupon, to &s;top my Legal Salary, are
now I hope in <HI>London,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI>
will bring them to you, or others of the
Society; with a Sermon of mine on the
Fifth Commandment, from which the
mo&s;t material part of the Charge is ta|ken,
when you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Now this Young Man is gone off,
here's no Church-of-<HI>England</HI> Mini&s;ter,
but my &s;elf and Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> who is a
Ma&s;ter of Arts of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Dublin;</HI> he
hath been here 20 Years, and formerly I
am afraid not very Regular and Sober;
tho I hope he much reformed: He hath
been arraigned at Bar here, and a Pri&s;o|ner
near a Year, for a Pa&s;&s;age only in a
Funeral Sermon, that reflected upon a
Deputy. So that what&s;oever Stories this
young Man Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> may tell your
Society, about a late Act of A&s;&s;embly
here, to invite over Mini&s;ters here, un|le&s;s
the Queen be plea&s;ed to &s;end us o|ver
a Governor that will protect us ac|cording
to Law, there's no tru&s;ting to
any Acts of this Place. The Lords have
had a Quaker for their Governor; and
their Deputies here, who call them&s;elves
our Ordinaries, are many of them no
Friends either to Clergymen, or Learn|ing;
as I found the la&s;t <HI>Whit&s;ontide,</HI>
when a Bully la&s;h'd me cau&s;le&s;ly with
has Whip, and tore my Gown from my
Back; and upon my Complaint to the
Lords Deputies of the Indignities put
upon me, our Chief Ju&s;tice, and mo&s;t
of them (except the Governor) took
has Part. The Governor hath but a
Vote in the Council of Deputies, and
&s;o they do as they plea&s;e. This Bully|ing
<PB N="59" REF="100">

<P>God forbid that I &s;hould repre&s;ent the

the Propagation of the Go&s;pel here, and
more particularly of that Excellent

tho&s;e too whom I have done the be&s;t of

Re&s;pect to my Brethren of the Clergy

young Man Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> never had), I
would have them very cautious of ven|turing
hither, till they have &s;ome A&s;&s;u|rance
of being better protected in their
Legal Rights, than I and &s;everal others
have experimentally found.</P>
<P>I do very much approve of the great|e&s;t
part of the Act which e&s;tabli&s;hes Re|ligious
Wor&s;hip in this Province. Tho&s;e
parts of which I object again&s;t for ju&s;t
Rea&s;ons, are contained in the inclo&s;ed
Petition to his Excellency the <HI>Palatine,</HI>
and the re&s;t of the Lords Proprietors,
which as you have opportunity, I in|treat
you to &s;hew the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI>

your Worthy Society. I have &s;ent
Dr. <HI>Bray</HI> &s;ome Letters, which are not
an&s;wer'd, and &s;o do not know where
he is.</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. <HI>Beveridge</HI> peru&s;ed
my Te&s;timonials from <HI>Stamford, Whitby,</HI>
and <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> where I lived much whil&s;t
a Non-Juror: He was much my Friend
in the Con&s;i&s;tory at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, at my
leaving <HI>England;</HI> and I would have trou|bled
him with a few Lines, if I had not
heard that he is de&s;ervedly promoted to
the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Bath and Wells.</HI> If
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> and the Society do
&s;end us any more Mini&s;ters, I de&s;ire they
may be Regular and Sober Men, and
&s;uch as will a little couragiou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert
the Dignity of their Function, the Rights
and Privileges of Churchmen, and their
Canons and Laws: If they be Men of
Mean and Sneaking Spirits, they will be
abu&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed here. I think the
be&s;t Service your Honourable Society
can do this young Man Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> is
to maintain him a few Years at one of
our Univer&s;ities, where he may better
learn the Principles and Government of
the Church of <HI>England</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by
Law, and &s;ome other u&s;eful Learning,
which I am afraid he wants.</P>
<P>I beg the Favour of you to a&s;&s;i&s;t me

endeavouring by a Paper under your

being Ratified by them, with that
Clau&s;e in it, where Twenty Commi&s;|&s;ioners

of the Act, becau&s;e it &s;eems to contra|dict,
or however is not reconcileable to
the Preamble of that Act, which &s;ettles
a Maintenance on the Mini&s;ter of the
Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Charles-Town.</HI> The
Preamble of that Act of A&s;&s;embly, is,
Whereas his late Maje&s;ty, King <HI>Charles</HI>
the II. of Ble&s;&s;ed and Happy Memory,
hath by his Letters Patents, and Royal
Grants of the Province of <HI>Carolina,</HI> to
<PB N="63" REF="104">
the Lords Proprietors provided and taken
care, That no Religious Mini&s;ter, ex|cept
that by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould have any
publick Maintenance.</P>
<P>'Tis well known, that Epi&s;copa|cy
is e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law in the Kingdom
of <HI>England,</HI> and all Epi&s;copally ordained
Mini&s;ters by their Oath of Canonical
Obedience are bound to approve of
Church Government by Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>The Oath of Canonical Obedience is
this:
<Q><P>I <HI>E. M.</HI> do Swear, That I do approve
the Doctrine and Di&s;cipline, or Government
E&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as
concerning all Things nece&s;&s;ary to Salva|tion,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will I ever give my con&s;ent to alter
this Government of this Church, by Arch|bi&s;hops,
Bi&s;hops, Deans, and Arch-Deacons,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> as it &s;tands now E&s;tabli&s;hed, and as by
Law it ought to &s;tand. And all the&s;e things
I do plainly and &s;incerely Acknowledge and
Swear, according to the common Sen&s;e and Un|der&s;tanding
of the &s;ame Words without Equi|vocation,
or mental Eva&s;ion, or &s;ecret Re&s;er|vation
what&s;oever. And this I do heartily,
willingly, and truly, upon the Faith of a
Chri&s;tian. So help me God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P></Q></P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> I do object again&s;t part of the
Act, which erects High Commi&s;&s;ioners
for Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;es, as being con|trary
to the Charter under the Broad
Seal of <HI>England</HI> to this Province.</P>
<P>That Charter &s;ays, That all By-Laws
of this Province &s;hall be con&s;onant to
Rea&s;on, and as near as may be conveni|ently
agreeable to the Laws and Cu&s;toms
of the Realm of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis well known, that King <HI>James</HI> the
II's. High Commi&s;&s;ion Court in Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
Affairs was condemned as Illegal,
by the Learned Divines and Lawyers of
<HI>England;</HI> and if the King or Queen who
are Supream in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs,
cannot legally erect &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ioners,
&s;ure the &s;ubordinate Powers under them
have no legal Power to con&s;titute &s;uch
Commi&s;&s;ioners. The Charter farther
&s;ays, that the By-Laws of this Province
mu&s;t be con&s;onant to Rea&s;on. In the Act
of A&s;&s;embly that erects Commi&s;&s;ioners
in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, 'tis Enacted,
That whatever Mini&s;ter &s;hall Marry any
within the degree of Con&s;anguinity
forbidden in the Table of Marriage, he
&s;hall forfeit an 100 <HI>l.</HI> though it be with
a Licen&s;e from the Governor, or Publi|cation
of the Banns Three &s;everal Holi|days.
How Con&s;onant that part of the
Law is to Rea&s;on, I leave to all judicious
People to judge.</P>
<P>The only de&s;ign of Marriage Licen|&s;es
that I know of being to &s;atisfy the
Mini&s;ter, that the Coa&s;t is clear from all
Precontracts, Con&s;anguinity, or other
lawful Letts and Impediments of Mar|riage.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly.</HI>
I object again&s;t Fourteen of the
Twenty Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by
the Act, for di&s;placing Mini&s;ters be|cau&s;e
they were Members of the late
A&s;&s;embly: Wherein Mr. <HI>Edward Marston</HI>
was unfairly and unju&s;tly u&s;ed: There|fore
he prote&s;ts again&s;t the Power over
him they may challenge by Virtue of
that Act. <HI>Be&s;ides, they are many of them
con&s;tant Ab&s;enters from the Church;</HI> and
<HI>Eleven of them were never known to receive
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and &s;o
perhaps their Religion may be to &s;eek.</HI> For the
afore&s;aid and &s;everal other weighty Rea|&s;ons,
your Petitioner, Mr. <HI>Edward Mar&s;ton,</HI>
legal Mini&s;ter of St. <HI>Phillip</HI>'s Church in
<HI>Charles-Town,</HI> doth beg of your Honours
not to ratify that part of the Act offer'd
to your Board, by your Deputies here,
in which, Twenty Commi&s;&s;ioners are
impower'd to di&s;place Mini&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
And in ca&s;e they give Him Mole&s;tation
by Virtue of that Act pa&s;&s;ed here, before
your Honours have confirmed it, He
doth prote&s;t again&s;t their Lawful
Power over Him as Commi&s;&s;ioners; and
<PB N="64" REF="105">
appeals to your Honourable Board from

<HEAD>The CASE of the Reverend Mr. Edward
Mar&s;ton, Mini&s;ter of the Church belong|ing
to the Church of England in Charles-Town,
in South Carolina, truly &s;tated.</HEAD>
<P>AT the Meeting of the General A&s;|&s;embly
of the Province in <HI>April,</HI>
in 1704. he was order'd by the Right
Honourable Governour Sir <HI>Nath. John|&s;ton,</HI>
to write down in a Paper what he
thought would be proper, for the better
Suppre&s;&s;ing of Vice and Wickedne&s;s in
this Town and Country, e&s;pecially on
the Lord's Day; and what other Things
he thought convenient for the better
Management of the Affairs of the Church,
and publick Monies given towards the
Erecting of a Free-School, and other pi|ous
U&s;es. Mr. <HI>Mar&s;ton</HI> obey'd the Order,
and when the Governour had read the
Paper, he reply'd, That it was mode&s;t
and rea&s;onable, and that he would pro|po&s;e
the Contents thereof to the A&s;|&s;embly,
which accordingly he did: Some
few Days after, he &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Mar&s;ton,</HI>
to &s;hew him the Reply of the Lower
Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly to that part of the
Speech, penn'd by Mr. <HI>Mar&s;ton,</HI> under
the Hand of <HI>Job How,</HI> E&s;&abque; Speaker, in
which Mr. <HI>Mar&s;ton</HI> was &s;currilou&s;ly abu&s;ed,
and very fal&s;e Epithets fix'd upon him by
them.</P>
<P>That part of the Governour's Speech
is in Packet to Br. <HI>Wigly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>About the &s;ame time, the Right Ho|nourable
Governour acquainted Mr.</HI> Mar|&s;ton,
That &s;ome of the Members of the A&s;|&s;embly
were endeavouring to wre&s;t the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Juri&s;diction of the Province out
of the Hands of the Right Honourable and
Right Reverend Father in God, <HI>Henry,</HI>
Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and out of the
Hands of the Right Honourable Governour,
Sir <HI>Nathaniel John&s;ton,</HI> as Ordinary;
<HI>which was the Occa&s;ion of the Paper,
called,</HI> A Reply to tho&s;e Members, <HI>&amp;c. &s;ent
in the afore&s;aid Packet al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>The Governour was plea&s;ed to qua&s;h
their De&s;ign at that Time; &s;o the Pa|per
was never &s;ent to any of them; but
being threaten'd in the Hou&s;e of Co|lonel
<HI>Risbee,</HI> one of the Members of the
A&s;&s;embly, about <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, <HI>That at the
next Se&s;&s;ions of A&s;&s;embly I &s;hould &s;ee the
Bi&s;hop of</HI> London'<HI>s Juri&s;diction aboli&s;h'd
here,</HI> I put the afore&s;aid Reply into the
Hands of Col. <HI>Risbee.</HI></P>
<P>Sometime after the Meeting of the
A&s;&s;embly in <HI>Octob.</HI> la&s;t, Landgrave <HI>Smith</HI>
was made a Pri&s;oner, by a Vote of the
Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly. On the fir&s;t
Day of his Confinement Mr <HI>Mar&s;ton</HI>
made him a Vi&s;it, to acquaint him with
the Death of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Wil|liam
Corbin,</HI> for &s;ometime Mini&s;ter of the
Congregation at <HI>Goos Creck</HI> in this Co|lony:
The next Morning, after my
Vi&s;it, Col. <HI>Risbee</HI> moved in the Lower
Hou&s;e, as &s;oon as it was &s;et, That I
&s;hould be order'd to &s;ay before the Hou&s;e
2 Sermons preach'd by me, one in <HI>April</HI>
la&s;t, the other about Three Weeks be|fore.
I obey'd their Order, and attend|ed
the Hou&s;e, with the Two Members
that came for me. My Paper in Packet
to Br <HI>Wigly,</HI> dated <HI>October</HI> the 11th, will
acquaint you with my An&s;wer to them,
<PB N="66" REF="107">
as the other Papers will with all the Pro|ceedings
of the A&s;&s;embly again&s;t me af|ter
that.</P>
<P>I went from the Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;|&s;embly
directly to the Right Honourable
the Governour, and laid the Sermons
before him, as Ordinary, he al&s;o having
been an Auditor of both of them. He
was plea&s;ed at that Time to be chole|rick
and angry, becau&s;e I had vi&s;ited
Landgrave <HI>Smith,</HI> and refu&s;ed to take
Notice of my Sermons, or of the Trou|ble
the Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly had
given me about them. I apply'd my
&s;elf to him and the Council by &s;everal
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Letters, in all which I hum|bly
crav'd of them, That I might be
allow'd an Hearing to vindicate my &s;elf
from tho&s;e fal&s;e Accu&s;ations which were
charged again&s;t me by the Lower Hou&s;e
of A&s;&s;embly. They would not allow me
an Hearing, but concurr'd with the Lower
Hou&s;e in the Cen&s;ure and Ordinance
thereupon, to deprive me of my Sala|ry,
the nece&s;&s;ary Sub&s;i&s;tence of my &s;elf,
a Wife, Three Children, and Three
more in Family, in this extravagantly
dear Place of all Nece&s;&s;aries for the
Support of Life.</P>
<P>I was not made acquainted with the
Conference of both the Hou&s;es about
this Affair; but they cho&s;e that very
Day to agree upon my Ruine, in which
they knew I was bu&s;ied to prepare a
Funeral Sermon for Capt. <HI>Weekly.</HI></P>
<P>I'm at the pre&s;ent a Confe&s;&s;or, for a&s;&s;ert|ing
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction of the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> in this Province, and
the Prerogative of being Ordinary here,
of our Right Honourable the Gover|nour,
again&s;t &s;ome illiterate and unrea|&s;onable
Men of the Lower Hou&s;e of
A&s;&s;embly of this Province, who at their
Se&s;&s;ions in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, were endeavouring
to wre&s;t the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction
out of the afore&s;aid Hands; and at their
la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>October,</HI> did accompli&s;h
their De&s;ign, by getting an Act pa&s;s'd
for con$$ituting Ruling Lay-Elders, or
<HI>Carolina</HI> Bi&s;hops, to turn out Clergy|men
from their Churches as they plea&s;e.
But, I hope, it will be proved, That
their new Act of A&s;&s;embly is repug|$$$t,
