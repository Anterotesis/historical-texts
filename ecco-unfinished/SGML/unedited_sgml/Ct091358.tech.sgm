<P>THE following Work was part of my
late father's Theological Prelections, as Pro|fe&s;&s;or
of Divinity. I know not whether he
ever intended to publi&s;h it; but had he lived
to prepare it for the pre&s;s, it would have ap|peared
in a much more perfect form than
that in which it is now offered to the Public.
I found part of it carefully revi&s;ed and cor|rected,
and tran&s;cribed on a different and
more exten&s;ive plan than what is followed
in his original notes on the &s;ubject. This
plan I have endeavoured to complete, though
con&s;cious of its being executed in a very in|ferior
manner to what him&s;elf would have
done. It is difficult to enter into another's
ideas, &s;o as to make them entirely one's
own, or to pur&s;ue his hints &s;o as to pre&s;erve
uniformity and con&s;i&s;tency. Whatever de|fects,
therefore, there may be in this re&s;pect,
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
or whatever inaccuracies in point of &s;tyle,
mu&s;t be charged &s;olely on the Editor. Such
as it is, it is hoped the Work will be u&s;eful.
This was the only view of its Author, who
compo&s;ed it for the benefit of tho&s;e Candi|dates
for the Mini&s;try who were under his
care; a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of whom i&s;&s;ued from
his &s;chool, and can, doubtle&s;s, bear te&s;timony
to the plea&s;ure and in&s;truction they derived
from this part of his Theological Cour&s;e:
and although it is peculiarly adapted to the
&s;ituation of Clergymen of the Church of
Scotland, yet it may not be unprofitable to
tho&s;e al&s;o of other per&s;ua&s;ions, who will find
it throughout breathing a &s;pirit of rational
and elevated piety, and marked with that
candour and moderation which di&s;tingui&s;hed
his character.</P>

<HEAD>THE
PASTORAL CARE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN every pur&s;uit, it is of great importance, fir&s;t
of all, to fix a proper end: for the nature of the
end determines the means which are &s;uitable, and
the cour&s;e which we mu&s;t take, in order to attain
it; and, if we fix a wrong end, it cannot fail to
mi&s;lead us into an improper track. The end of
every part of education, and every kind of &s;tudy,
ought to be, to fit men either for the general du|ties
of life incumbent upon all, or for &s;ome of
tho&s;e particular employments which, for the com|mon
convenience, are di&s;tributed to different men.
Whatever contributes to neither of the&s;e purpo&s;es,
is unprofitable or perverted: nothing can be of
real value, but &s;o far as it promotes one or the
other of them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9">
Every employment requires &s;ome education or
preparation for it: and this mu&s;t always be adapted
to the nature of that employment. It mu&s;t always
include two things:&mdash;in&s;tructions concerning the
principles and functions of the art;&mdash;and exerci&s;es
fit for begetting a habit of acting according to
the&s;e principles, and executing the&s;e functions. In
a mechanical art, for example, a per&s;on mu&s;t fir&s;t
learn the nature of the &s;everal materials and in|&s;truments
belonging to it, and the manner of
u&s;ing them; and next he mu&s;t be accu&s;tomed to
u&s;e them, till he gradually acquire dexterity.
Both the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary: without knowlege,
practice would be undirected, lame, and blunder|ing;
and without exerci&s;e, the greate&s;t knowlege
could not prevent our being awkward, and at a
lo&s;s in attempting to perform.</P>
<P>Different employments require different methods
of education. In&s;tructions and exerci&s;es nece&s;&s;ary
in an apprentice&s;hip for one art, would be u&s;ele&s;s,
or even ab&s;urd, in an apprentice&s;hip for another.
The peculiar education proper for any art, can be
a&s;certained only by attention to the nature of that
art. Its nature ought to be con&s;tantly kept in
view, that the proper &s;tudies and exerci&s;es may
be &s;elected, and conducted in &s;uch a manner as
to become mo&s;t effectually &s;ub&s;ervient to it. This
is in &s;ome degree requi&s;ite even in the mechanical
employments: but it is more indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary
in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions which hold of the &s;ciences.
<PB N="3" REF="10">
In the former, a great deal may be learned merely
by habit, and performed mechanically, by tho&s;e
who are almo&s;t&punc; totally ignorant of the principles
from which the practice is derived. The philo&s;o|pher
explains the&s;e principles&mdash;the ingenious arti&s;t
reduces them to practice; but the ordinary me|chanic
acquires the practice without under&s;tanding
the principles on which he works. The mecha|nical
powers, with their &s;everal combinations, are
every day employed by per&s;ons who know nothing
of the theory of them. Yet even in the&s;e arts,
knowlege of the principles gives a great advan|tage
for practice: it di&s;tingui&s;hes the inventor, the
improver, the workman of ingenuity and ta&s;te,
from the mere artificer. But in &s;cientifical pro|fe&s;&s;ions,
no part of the practice is wholly mecha|nical;
no &s;tep can be taken but in con&s;equence of
knowlege of the principles: and the practice will
always be more or le&s;s proper in proportion to the
accuracy of that knowlege. A phy&s;ician, for in|&s;tance,
cannot practi&s;e his art without under&s;tand|ing
medicine; wherever his knowlege fails, his
practice mu&s;t be deficient; and without a previous
idea of what the bu&s;ine&s;s of a phy&s;ician is, he could
not with any degree of &s;ucce&s;s prepare him&s;elf
for it.</P>
<P>The pa&s;toral office is of this kind. It cannot be
properly exerci&s;ed by a per&s;on who knows not the
&s;everal duties belonging to it, who is not acquaint|ed
<PB N="4" REF="11">
with the principles and &s;entiments requi&s;ite in
di&s;charging them, and who has not learned the
proper manner of teaching and treating mankind,
&s;o as to accompli&s;h the end of his office. The na|ture
of the pa&s;toral office is therefore a &s;ubject very
nece&s;&s;ary to be examined in the cour&s;e of your
theological &s;tudies. The right di&s;charge of its
functions is the very end to which all your private
&s;tudies, all the in&s;tructions delivered from this
place, and all the exerci&s;es pre&s;cribed to you,
ought to be &s;ubordinate. So far only as they
qualify you for that, they are u&s;eful, or at lea&s;t
peculiar to you as &s;tudents of theology. A ju&s;t
conception of the pa&s;toral office will enable you to
perceive, what &s;tudies are nece&s;&s;ary to prepare you
for it, and to di&s;tingui&s;h in what degree they are
nece&s;&s;ary, that your attention to them may be in
proportion to their utility. It will enable you to
di&s;cern, how every part of &s;tudy is applicable to
the execution of that office, and to learn the proper
u&s;e of the &s;everal parts of &s;cience, while you are
acquiring the knowlege of their principles. In
whatever period of your theological &s;tudies you
happen now to be, the pa&s;toral office may very
profitably engage your attention. If you are but
beginning them, it will fix a proper aim at your
fir&s;t &s;etting out. If you are nearly fini&s;hing them,
it is high time to think &s;eriou&s;ly of the office which
you may be &s;oon called to undertake. At every
&s;tep, a ju&s;t idea of it will afford a light by which
<PB N="5" REF="12">
you may review your pa&s;t, and direct your future
&s;tudies.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on who con&s;iders the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
things, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that there is great need to
in&s;i&s;t on the real nature of the pa&s;toral office. In
all ages the be&s;t men have complained, that the
generality entered on it too forwardly, and with|out
&s;ufficient preparation. At pre&s;ent, many &s;eem
to think &s;carcely any preparation nece&s;&s;ary. They
be&s;tow very few years upon it: and they mu&s;t be
con&s;cious, how &s;mall a part even of the&s;e they em|ploy
for the very purpo&s;e of qualifying them&s;elves
for it. While a long apprentice&s;hip is required for
every ordinary trade, while inten&s;e &s;tudy and ap|plication
are acknowleged to be nece&s;&s;ary for every
other learned or liberal profe&s;&s;ion, little &s;tudy or
application is imagined to be needful for the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of a clergyman. This cannot fail to render
many unfit for performing it with &s;atisfaction to
them&s;elves, or with honour in the eyes of the
world: and it plainly tends to bring the office into
di&s;credit, and to make men think that any per&s;on
is &s;ufficiently qualified for being entru&s;ted with it.
An effectual check to this evil, by public authority,
would be highly de&s;irable: but, I fear, it can
&s;carcely be expected. It is for this rea&s;on the more
nece&s;&s;ary to endeavour to impre&s;s you with a &s;en&s;e
of the genuine nature of the pa&s;toral office, for
which you are candidates. This will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in
your preparation for it: and this will leave it on
<PB N="6" REF="13">
every one's own con&s;cience to determine, how far
he is really fit to enter on it.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject may be reduced to three general
heads;&mdash;the importance of the pa&s;toral office,&mdash;the
duties belonging to it,&mdash;and the requi&s;ites for per|forming
them.</P>

<P>THE importance of the pa&s;toral office may
be con&s;idered as ari&s;ing from two circum|&s;tances:
&mdash;its dignity, and its difficulty; which it
will be proper to examine &s;eparately.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Dignity of the Pa&s;toral Office.</HEAD>
<P>IN examining the dignity of the pa&s;toral office,
we &s;hall point out&mdash;the real nature of its dig|nity;
and the &s;entiments &s;uitable to it, which it
requires, both in tho&s;e who hold that office, and
in others.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="8" REF="15">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The true Nature of the Dignity of the Pa&s;toral
Office.</HEAD>
<P>IT is on many accounts nece&s;&s;ary and proper to
a&s;certain the true nature and grounds of that dig|nity
which belongs to the pa&s;toral office. By &s;ome,
its dignity has been, not de&s;cribed and delineated,
but di&s;played in all the pomp of eloquence, and
exaggerated by an accumulation of the bolde&s;t
figures<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gregor. Nazianz. Apologet. Chry&s;o&s;tom. de Sacerdot.</NOTE>. A florid imagination prompted them
to repre&s;ent it in this manner: the ta&s;te and bias
of the times bore it, or even invited it. The prin|ciples
of the pre&s;ent age would give no indulgence
to declamation of that kind. It is indeed improper
in it&s;elf. Magnificent figures, if they be not &s;trictly
ju&s;t, convey no preci&s;e ideas: they may amaze,
but they infu&s;e no permanent &s;entiments: they
may produce an unmeaning emotion for a moment,
but they form no determinate and durable temper.
To rai&s;e the dignity of the pa&s;toral office above the
naked truth, by vague images and indefinite am|plifications,
is not u&s;ele&s;s only; I am afraid, it is
hurtful al&s;o. Did it really obtain credit, it would
lead every mode&s;t, &s;erious, con&s;cientious per&s;on to
con&s;ider that office as too &s;ublime for any mortal
man, and too pure for any imperfect creature to
venture on; as not de&s;irable, but tremendous,
<PB N="9" REF="16">
and by all means to be avoided. They who have
delighted in giving &s;uch repre&s;entations of it, have
likewi&s;e thought them&s;elves obliged to affect de|clining
it, to flee into de&s;arts, and to &s;eem to be
dragged thence by violence to the acceptance of it.
They &s;hewed, however, that their fancy had a greater
&s;hare in the&s;e repre&s;entations than their judgment,
and that they did not fully give credit to them:
for without attempting to confute them, they af|terwards
&s;uffered them&s;elves to be inve&s;ted with
that very office. None who &s;incerely regarded it
in that point of view, could think of undertaking
it, except they were &s;o worthle&s;s as to have no
con&s;cience, no &s;en&s;e of obligation, no concern to
fulfil their duty<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stilling fleet, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ca&s;es, Part I. charge ii&punc; p. 116,
&amp;c.</NOTE>. They who ventured to occupy
it, would be elated with pride and arrogance:
others would either pay them exce&s;&s;ive and per|verted
veneration, or ridicule the extravagance of
their claims. What has real dignity and import|ance,
&s;tands not in need of exaggeration: and it
mu&s;t &s;uffer by it. A &s;imple expo&s;ition of its in|trin&s;ic
moment, is &s;ufficient for procuring it that
kind and degree of honour which it merits, and
will mo&s;t effectually procure it.</P>
<P>It has been common to repre&s;ent the pa&s;toral
office as holy, as placing tho&s;e who hold it in a
peculiar relation to God. There is a foundation
<PB N="10" REF="17">
both in &s;cripture and in rea&s;on, for the repre&s;ent|ation,
provided it be properly under&s;tood. Under
the Old Te&s;tament, not only Aaron and his &s;ons,
but the prie&s;ts al&s;o, and the Levites, were declared
to be &startq;holy unto their God,&endq; and to be &startq;&s;ancti|fied,&endq;
and &startq;con&s;ecrated to &s;tand before the Lord,
and to mini&s;ter to him.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxviii. 1. 3, 4. 36. 41. Lev. xxi. 6, 7, 8. Num. iii.
12, 13. 41.</NOTE>&endq; Solemn rites, very
circum&s;tantially de&s;ined, were expre&s;sly appointed
by God him&s;elf, for their &s;eparation to their offices.
The go&s;pel not being, like the law, a di&s;pen&s;ation
of ceremonies, God has not, with equal preci&s;ion,
fixed rites for the &s;eparation of per&s;ons to the
Chri&s;tian mini&s;try: nor do the writers of the New
Te&s;tament apply to this office all the &s;ame terms
which are u&s;ed concerning the ancient prie&s;thood;
and which had, perhaps, a reference to the man|ner
of &s;eparation for it. But Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters
are &s;poken of in terms which plainly imply, that
their office places them in a peculiar relation to God.
It is, I doubt not, partly with a re&s;pect to their
in&s;piration and their immediate commi&s;&s;ion from
Chri&s;t, that the Apo&s;tles are called &startq;amba&s;&s;adors
for&endq; him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 20.</NOTE>: but unin&s;pired teachers are called by
a name nearly equivalent, &startq;angels<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 1.</NOTE>,&endq; or me&s;&s;en|gers.
The in&s;pired apo&s;tles were in a peculiar
&s;en&s;e, &startq;&s;tewards of the my&s;teries of God<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1.</NOTE>,&endq; which
<PB N="11" REF="18">
were revealed to them: but every Chri&s;tian pa&s;tor
is likewi&s;e a &startq;&s;teward of God<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Tit. 1. 7.</NOTE>,&endq; in a place of
tru&s;t and authority in his family, appointed to
di&s;pen&s;e in&s;truction to others. The teachers of
the go&s;pel are all, in a &s;en&s;e in which other
Chri&s;tians are not, the &s;ervants and mini&s;ters of
God; peculiarly appropriated to him, and &s;et
apart for pre&s;enting the devotions of others to him,
and publi&s;hing his will to them.</P>
<P>It cannot, however, be denied, that the idea of
the &s;anctity of the pa&s;toral office has been often
mi&s;under&s;tood and abu&s;ed. Confu&s;ed and im|proper
notions of it have been propagated, and
perverted to the ba&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es of &s;uper&s;tition.
That idea has been &s;o much over&s;tretched and
di&s;torted, as to be made to imply an exemption
from the authority and juri&s;diction of magi&s;trates,
from &s;ubjection to all human laws, and from the
common obligations of men in &s;ociety; a power
of giving, in a greater or a le&s;s extent, according
to the different degrees of the clerical character,
a virtue and efficacy, a kind of magical charm,
to the ordinances of religion; a privilege of ob|taining
a higher mea&s;ure of the favour of God,
than other men, or of obtaining it on different and
ea&s;ier terms; a &s;ort of intere&s;t with God, to en|gage
him in all their views, to render every cau&s;e
of theirs his cau&s;e, to make it impious to oppo&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="19">
them, or to puni&s;h their crimes, and to draw down
his judgments on all whom they reckon their ene|mies.
Such unholy claims cannot po&s;&s;ibly be
founded on the holine&s;s of the mini&s;try: they are
the offspring of ignorance and arrogance; they
are by turns the nur&s;es and the nur&s;elings of &s;u|per&s;tition.
The Chri&s;tian mini&s;try is truly an holy
office: but it is &s;o, only in this &s;en&s;e, that it is
occupied about holy things, that its object is re|ligion.
They who exerci&s;e this office, are holy
only in this &s;en&s;e, that they &startq;mini&s;ter about holy
things,&endq; and that they are &s;trictly obliged to real
holine&s;s, to moral goodne&s;s, without which their
character mu&s;t be repugnant to the &s;ubject of
their profe&s;&s;ion. The con&s;ideration, therefore, of
the nature of the pa&s;toral office, will lead us to the
very &s;ame view of its dignity, to which we &s;hould
be led by a ju&s;t conception of its &s;anctity: and it
will render the exhibition of it more di&s;tinct and
preci&s;e, and le&s;s liable to mi&s;con&s;truction or abu&s;e,
as well as more agreeable to the &s;tile of the New
Te&s;tament. Following this track, we &s;hall a&s;cer|tain
the real dignity of the pa&s;toral office, by the
con&s;ideration of its acknowleged end, and of its
natural functions.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e, the dignity of an occupation de|pends,
in a great degree, upon its end. From
this &s;ource, the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, of all occupa|tions,
derives the greate&s;t dignity. The go&s;pel of
Chri&s;t, which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of that office to
<PB N="13" REF="20">
preach, &startq;is the power of God unto &s;alvation<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 16.</NOTE>.&endq;
All the kinds of teachers in the Chri&s;tian church,
are given for this purpo&s;e, &startq;for the perfecting of
the &s;aints, for the edifying of the body of
Chri&s;t<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 12.</NOTE>, that, warning every man, and teaching
every man, in all wi&s;dom, they may pre&s;ent
every man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 28.</NOTE>.&endq; The
con&s;equence of the right di&s;charge of this office
will be, that they &s;hall &startq;both &s;ave them&s;elves,
and them that hear them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE>.&endq; It is its direct
aim, to carry forward, in a certain degree, that
di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, which has, through all ages,
been the grand and favourite object of God's pro|vidence
in this lower world; in promoting which
all the ho&s;ts of angels are employed; in the ex|ecution
of which the Son of God was incarnate
and crucified, and the Holy Spirit given; and
which terminates in conferring eternal life on as
many as comply with it. While thus employed,
mini&s;ters are not only &startq;fellow-&s;ervants&endq; of the
angels<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. 9.</NOTE>, but al&s;o &startq;workers together with God,
be&s;eeching men, as though God did be&s;eech
men by them, praying them in Chri&s;t's &s;tead,
that they be reconciled to God, and that they
receive not the grace of God in vain<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 20. vi. 1.</NOTE>.&endq; The
pa&s;toral office is concerned, not about the fortunes
of men, not about their lives, but about what is
infinitely nobler, about their &s;ouls: it is concerned
<PB N="14" REF="21">
about the intere&s;ts, not of time, but of eternity.
In a far &s;ublimer &s;en&s;e than that in which the an|cient
painter gloried, the Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter works
for immortality. If the lawyer &s;ucceed not in his
cau&s;e, his client may be reduced to poverty; if
the &s;kill of the phy&s;ician prove ineffectual, his
patient will die: but, in whatever ca&s;e the end of
the pa&s;toral office is defeated, everla&s;ting de&s;truction
is the con&s;equence. Such being the end of$ that
office, to &s;uppo&s;e any in&s;en&s;ible of its importance,
would be to &s;uppo&s;e them be&s;otted by the vanities
of time, and blind to the intere&s;ts of eternity.
And does this end reflect no dignity on the office
which is adapted to it? Can it but be an honour|able
employment, to promote &s;o great a de&s;ign?</P>
<P>The pa&s;toral office derives dignity and import|ance
from the nature of its functions, as well as
from the &s;ublimity of its end. For our perceiving
this, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a minute
detail of the&s;e functions; they will be explained
afterwards. At pre&s;ent it will be &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve
in general, that they con&s;i&s;t in &startq;teaching<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 11. vi. 2. 2 Tim. ii. 2. Eph. iv. 11. Rom. xii. 7.</NOTE>&endq;

proper opportunity, in public and in private, of
promoting them; in &startq;being en&s;amples to the
flock<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 3.</NOTE>, in all things &s;hewing them&s;elves pat|terns

intermi&s;&s;ion to qualify them&s;elves more and
more for all this, and then exerting them&s;elves
indefatigably in it; in a word, in u&s;ing every
means that can be u&s;ed by one man for infu&s;ing
knowlege and goodne&s;s into other men. That
the&s;e functions confer dignity on the office to
which they belong, will be evident, whether we
con&s;ider them in them&s;elves in relation to their
end, or in re&s;pect of their nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s
to the people.</P>
<P>Some exerci&s;es are in their nature low and
mean; to be engaged in them, &s;inks a per&s;on in
the eyes of others. The go&s;pel engages its mi|ni&s;ters
in no exerci&s;es of this kind. It lays them
under peculiar obligations to practi&s;e and improve
in all piety and virtue; if they fulfil the obliga|tions,
they acquire that righteou&s;ne&s;s which ren|ders
<PB N="16" REF="23">
a man &startq;more excellent than his neighbour<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Prov. xii. 26.</NOTE>&endq;
It engages them in the &s;earch of truth, and in
communicating knowlege: and if it be any part of
the dignity of man, that he is a rea&s;onable crea|ture,
it mu&s;t be honourable to be employed in
&s;earching after truth, and diffu&s;ing it among men.
To di&s;cover truth in that extent which belongs to
the pa&s;toral office, requires, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable
compa&s;s of previous knowlege, the exertion both
of the acutene&s;s of the philo&s;opher, and of the
judgment of the critic. In communicating it &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
to others, the talents of the orator mu&s;t
be, in &s;ome degree, employed. Each of the&s;e
characters has always been acknowleged re&s;pect|able:
to deny, therefore, that the pa&s;toral office,
which requires the union of them all, is re&s;pect|able,
would be to judge of this one ca&s;e, in con|tradiction
to the natural &s;entiments of all mankind
in every other ca&s;e. To promote any kind of
u&s;eful knowlege, has &s;ome merit; the name of a
teacher gives a per&s;on &s;ome elevation, in that one
re&s;pect at lea&s;t, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e who are
taught by him: and the elevation bears always a
proportion to the &s;ubject which a per&s;on is qualified
to teach, and engaged in teaching. It is the very
office of mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, to teach others:
and the &s;ubject of their teaching is the &s;ublime&s;t,
the mo&s;t important, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting: it is
honourable to be occupied in teaching it; it is
<PB N="17" REF="24">
very honourable to be fit to teach it. It is the
very bu&s;ine&s;s of mini&s;ters, to inculcate the noble&s;t
truths, tho&s;e which regard God and divine things;
to recommend univer&s;al goodne&s;s, the glory of
human nature; to form the &s;ouls of men to that
divine temper which will fit them for the everla&s;t|ing
&s;ociety of God; to &startq;feed&endq; and &startq;over&s;ee&endq;
with care, that church on which the Lord &s;et &s;o
high a value, as to &startq;purcha&s;e it with his own
blood<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 28.</NOTE>.&endq; The office of a teacher implies au|thority,
the kind and degree of authority which
&s;uits its nature. The teachers of Chri&s;tianity have
authority in the church; they &startq;are over you,&endq;
&s;ays the apo&s;tle, they &startq;have the rule over you in
the Lord<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. v. 12. Heb. xiii. 17.</NOTE>.&endq; Their authority is of the kind
which is congruous to their work: they neither
are &startq;Lords over God's heritage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 3.</NOTE>,&endq; nor &startq;have
dominion over men's faith<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 24.</NOTE>.&endq; They often
have claimed temporal power, political authority,
and civil dignities: but the claim is u&s;urpation;
the&s;e are the pre-eminences of the kingdoms of
this world, but their office is &s;olely in the kingdom
of Chri&s;t, which &startq;is not of this world<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">John, xviii. 36.</NOTE>:&endq; the&s;e
have a relation to the &s;ecular affairs of men, but
this office only to their &s;piritual concerns. Even
in their &s;piritual concerns, the authority of mi|ni&s;ters
<PB N="18" REF="25">
is very far from being ab&s;olute or unlimited.
It includes no power over the con&s;ciences of men;
no right to impo&s;e upon them, any principles of
belief, or rules of conduct, but tho&s;e which the
&s;cripture has impo&s;ed; no right to obtrude upon
them our explications of &s;cripture or deductions
from it. The claim or exerci&s;e of &s;uch rights, is
not the government of Chri&s;t, but the tyranny of
Antichri&s;t: both to the people and to mini&s;ters,
the &s;cripture is the only &s;tandard of religion: mi|ni&s;ters
have authority to teach only what it
teaches; and by it, and by it alone, it is the
right of the people, and their duty al&s;o, to exa|mine
what is taught. Even tho&s;e doctrines and
tho&s;e precepts which are clearly contained in &s;crip|ture,
the pa&s;toral office gives no authority to en|force
by methods of violence: the&s;e are the in&s;tru|ments
of political authority, the authority of pa&s;|tors
is purely &s;piritual. Religious belief and prac|tice
are of no value if they be not voluntary, if
they proceed not from conviction and con&s;cience.
Whenever civil penalties are applied to force them,
they are mi&s;applied. This is, impotently to at|tempt
promoting the kingdom of Chri&s;t, by an
unnatural alliance with the kingdoms of the world.
Per&s;ecution never can be but improper; but in a
mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel it is mo&s;t improper. When
irreligion, vice, or &s;uper&s;tition, &s;o directly affect
the proper intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, as to render it mo&s;t
ju&s;t to check them by laws, as civil crimes, the
<PB N="19" REF="26">
enacting and executing the&s;e laws, is the province
of the rulers of the &s;tate, not of the rulers of the
church. Their authority is only a right to teach
the truths which the &s;criptures teach, to inculcate
the duties which they require, to rebuke and cen|&s;ure
the &s;ins which they forbid, and to be li&s;tened
to while they do &s;o: and they are entitled to &s;up|port
this authority by no other engines, but the
power of per&s;ua&s;ion and the influence of exemplary
virtue. It is the dignity which re&s;ults from this
kind of authority, and it alone, that belongs to
the pa&s;toral office.</P>
<P>The functions of the pa&s;toral office, thus worthy
in them&s;elves, will appear &s;till more worthy and
important, when they are con&s;idered in relation
to their end. It is &s;o &s;ublime, that it reflects ho|nour
and importance on whatever has any, even
the remote&s;t, connexion with it; but the clo&s;er
the connexion of any functions is with it, and the
&s;tronger their tendency to promote it, the greater
in proportion will be their moment. Exerci&s;es
mean in them&s;elves, cea&s;e to be mean when they
are undertaken for &s;ome great or good end: then
men will glory in them, who in any other &s;itua|tion
would have blu&s;hed to have been found em|ployed
in them. The functions of the pa&s;toral
office are the natural, the direct, and proper
means of promoting the mo&s;t important of all
ends: this is &s;ufficient to ennoble &s;uch of them as
are meane&s;t in appearance. Pa&s;tors are &startq;watch|men<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 17. Ezek. iii. 17. xxxiii. 7.</NOTE>:&endq;
<PB N="20" REF="27">
but it is for &startq;the &s;oul<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 17.</NOTE>,&endq; the im|mortal
part, that they watch. They are &startq;&s;ol|diers<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 3, 4. Phil. ii. 25.</NOTE>:&endq;
but it is in &startq;the good fight of faith<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 12.</NOTE>.&endq;
They are &startq;labourers,&endq; but it is &startq;together with
God,&endq; and in &startq;his vineyard, his hu&s;bandry,
his harve&s;t<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. 37, 38. 1 Cor. iii. 6.&mdash;9.</NOTE>.&endq; They are &startq;builders;&endq; but it is
of the &startq;temple of God<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ver. 9, 10. 12. 16.</NOTE>.&endq; Such metaphors,
though &s;ome of them &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to be
taken from mean employments, ri&s;e in their &s;igni|&s;ication,
when they are applied to the exerci&s;es of
an office which has eternity for its aim; as an
in&s;ignificant piece of canvas comes to be of great
price when it is made the ground of a capital pic|ture.
They are intended only to expre&s;s the diffi|culties
and the labours of that profe&s;&s;ion. The&s;e
le&s;&s;en not its dignity: they add to it. Some of
the mo&s;t eminent offices are very laborious; but
their toils are honourable. Whenever they are of
great utility, and exten&s;ive con&s;equence, it is noble
to encounter them, it is worthy to be indefatigable
in undergoing them, it is glorious to vanqui&s;h
them.</P>
<P>Finally, the pa&s;toral office is important, and
ought to be reckoned honourable by the people,
becau&s;e to them it is needful. The end of all its
functions is their &s;alvation; and in proportion to
<PB N="21" REF="28">
its nece&s;&s;ity for this end, it is intere&s;ting to them.
It is &s;olely for the &s;ake of the people, that God has
appointed pa&s;tors in his church; and to the people
all their functions have an immediate relation. It
belongs indeed to every individual, to &startq;work out
his own &s;alvation<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 12.</NOTE>:&endq; without his own care, as
well as the grace of God, all the labours of the
mini&s;ter cannot enlighten his under&s;tanding, &s;anc|tify
his heart, or &s;ave his &s;oul. Yet the labours
of the mini&s;ter are &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary to the people.
With abhorrence we di&s;claim the fal&s;e preten&s;ion,
that religious knowlege is, or ought to be confined
to the clergy: God has e&s;tabli&s;hed no &s;uch ba&s;e
or &s;lavi&s;h dependence of rea&s;on and con&s;cience
upon fallible men. The people, as well as their
pa&s;tors, have acce&s;s to the &s;criptures; it is equally
their right and their duty to &startq;&s;earch&endq; and &startq;know
them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">John, v. 39.</NOTE>:&endq; and they &startq;are able to make them
wi&s;e unto &s;alvation<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 15.</NOTE>.&endq; But the bulk of man|kind
are, and will always nece&s;&s;arily be, much oc|cupied
about worldly affairs; and, thus occupied,
will want the inclination, the lei&s;ure, the opportu|nities,
the capacity, the education, or the means,
requi&s;ite for collecting religious knowlege, and
fixing good impre&s;&s;ions on their hearts. The weak,
the ignorant, the thoughtle&s;s, the di&s;&s;ipated, the
bu&s;y, the corrupted, have ab&s;olute need of one to
<PB N="22" REF="29">
in&s;truct them, to direct them, to remind them of
&s;piritual things, to excite them to their duty.
Without this, very many will infallibly neglect it,
and lo&s;e their &s;ouls by the neglect. It is no exag|geration
to &s;ay, that the future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery
of at lea&s;t &s;ome of the people, depends on the
proper or the improper conduct of their teachers.
We ju&s;tly complain that the pa&s;toral office, even
when its functions are performed with the greate&s;t
&s;kill and care, produces not &s;o great or happy
effects as it &s;eems to be &s;it for producing: but
were that office to cea&s;e, the ignorance and wicked|ne&s;s
of the world would &s;oon demon&s;trate, that it
does produce very great and very happy effects.
It cannot be a mean employment, which is both
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o profitable to mankind. The
care of immortal &s;ouls is the mo&s;t important of all
tru&s;ts: the training of them for heaven is the
mo&s;t excellent of all occupations<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Pa&s;toral Care, chap. i. Scougal's Synod Serm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus I have evinced the importance of the
pa&s;toral office, by &s;hewing its dignity and excel|lence.
Avoiding all vague panegyric, declining
indefinite declamation concerning its &s;anctity, I
have &s;atisfied my&s;elf with coolly a&s;certaining the
real kind and degree of dignity, which it evidently
derives from the &s;ublimity of its end, and the
worthy and intere&s;ting nature of its functions.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Dignity of the Pa&s;toral Office.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH as we have de&s;cribed being the dignity of
the pa&s;toral office, let us next inquire, what &s;en|timents
its dignity ought to impre&s;s, both on tho&s;e
who occupy it, and on tho&s;e who a&s;pire to it. It
certainly becomes them to cultivate and pre&s;erve a
&s;en&s;e of its importance, and likewi&s;e to render
that &s;en&s;e ju&s;t and properly directed. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to do both; a failure in either will be pro|ductive
of pernicious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The want of all &s;en&s;e of its dignity, will lead
men to con&s;ider it in the low and paltry light of
only a trade or living. This would demon&s;trate
a very abject &s;pirit, and it would render it every
day more abject. Con&s;idered in that light, it
mu&s;t appear one of the meane&s;t of all employ|ments;
for there are few who&s;e profits are not
more con&s;iderable. Men would, however, enter
on it with merely intere&s;ted views. They would
long for it, as a provi&s;ion. They would not
be much concerned either to qualify them&s;elves
for its duties, or to exert them&s;elves in per|forming
them. They would be &s;atisfied with re|ceiving
the profits, though they were negligent or
little capable of doing the work. In the language
of &s;cripture, emphatically expre&s;&s;ive of the ba&s;e|ne&s;s
of this mercenary &s;pirit, they would &startq;feed
<PB N="24" REF="31">
them&s;elves,&endq; and &startq;not feed the flock<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiv. 2, &amp;c.</NOTE>,&endq; but
leave it to be &startq;&s;tolen, killed, and de&s;troyed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">John, x. 10.</NOTE>.&endq;
It is your &s;etting out with a high &s;en&s;e of the dig|nity
and importance of your profe&s;&s;ion, and your
con&s;tantly maintaining that &s;en&s;e, that will be&s;t
pre&s;erve you from thinking or acting beneath it,
and will form you to &s;uch elevation of views, &s;uch
exertion, and &s;uch dignity of conduct, as be|come
it.</P>
<P>Your &s;en&s;e of its dignity mu&s;t not only be high,
but likewi&s;e ju&s;t. As the nature of its dignity may
be mi&s;conceived, &s;o the &s;en&s;e of its dignity may
be perverted: and every perver&s;ion of it will pro|duce
corre&s;pondent ill effects on the temper and
the conduct.</P>
<P>A general and indefinite conception of the pa&s;|toral
office, as merely an honourable employment,
e&s;pecially if it were at the &s;ame time exaggerated
and extravagant, would excite an unhallowed am|bition
and impatience for it as a pre-eminence, till
it were obtained; and would afterwards elate the
heart with arrogance, pride, and in&s;olence. The&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions are naturally enough produced by the ho|nours
which con&s;i&s;t only in di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and
titles, and which are founded wholly in imagina|tion:
but by the dignity of the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try,
<PB N="25" REF="32">
they cannot be produced, except it be totally mi&s;|under&s;tood;
for its dignity re&s;ults &s;olely from the
real utility of its functions. The&s;e are pa&s;&s;ions the
mo&s;t unbecoming in the &s;ervants of the humble
Je&s;us, &s;it only to render them&s;elves odious, and
to pervert the whole &s;pirit and tenor of their mi|ni&s;trations.
Therefore, the apo&s;tle directs, that a
bi&s;hop be not an unin&s;tructed, incon&s;iderate &startq;no|vice,
le&s;t being li&s;ted up with pride, he fall

<P>A vague and ill-dige&s;ted opinion of the &s;anctity
of the pa&s;toral office, would beget the mo&s;t pre|&s;umptuous
kind of pride: it would give it the
blacke&s;t of all its forms: it would forge a claim to
&s;uper&s;titious re&s;pect and blind veneration from the
people. This is the temper which Chri&s;t reproves
&s;o &s;everely in the Phari&s;ees, who &startq;loved the up|permo&s;t
rooms at fea&s;ts, and the chief &s;eats in

church, to a demand of privileges mo&s;t foreign to
its real &s;anctity, and a licence in practices mo&s;t
repugnant to every conception of holine&s;s. It is
undoubtedly proper that we be &s;en&s;ible of its
being an holy office: but our &s;en&s;e of this mu&s;t be
formed and defined by a di&s;tinct conception of the
real nature of its holine&s;s. It is not a notion that
the mere occupation of it can render us holy; but
a &s;ettled per&s;ua&s;ion that it will lay us under the
&s;tricte&s;t obligation to labour to become holy, and
&s;till more holy. It is a fixed per&s;ua&s;ion, that un|hallowed
hands and an un&s;anctified heart are unfit
to be employed in its holy functions. It is a lively
&s;en&s;e, that all impurity is more incongruous to the
&s;ubject of the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, than the mo&s;t
vulgar manners, the mo&s;t &s;ordid &s;pirit, and the
coar&s;e&s;t &s;entiments, would be to the highe&s;t rank.
It is a conviction that that office gives tho&s;e who
exerci&s;e it, great advantages for becoming holy;
united with a conviction that, except they be care|ful
to improve them, they will not make them
holy, but will on the contrary confirm and harden
them in wickedne&s;s; and that the &s;trength of their
obligations, and the greatne&s;s of their advantages,
will render the guilt of neglecting holine&s;s heinous,
and its puni&s;hment &s;evere. In a word, a &s;en&s;e
that the pa&s;toral office will place you in a near and
peculiar relation to God, &s;hould make you to look
upon your&s;elves as bound to approach as near to
<PB N="27" REF="34">
him as you can, in your temper, by &s;trict purity,
exalted virtue, and fervent piety.</P>
<P>A ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the dignity of the pa&s;toral office
mu&s;t be formed and directed by a preci&s;e idea of
the nature and grounds of that dignity, and be
rendered perfectly corre&s;pondent to it. It is a
&s;en&s;e, that the duties of that office are of the mo&s;t
excellent nature, and of the mo&s;t &s;acred obliga|tion,
and that it is of infinite moment that they be
di&s;charged aright. Such a &s;en&s;e of its dignity,
however high it be, will produce none of tho&s;e
evil pa&s;&s;ions which &s;pring &s;o naturally from a
vague or perverted conception of it. It can give
no encouragement to fal&s;e ambition, pride, or
haughtine&s;s: it will be the mo&s;t powerful antidote
again&s;t them. It will lead you often to compare
the &startq;trea&s;ure&endq; of the go&s;pel, with the &startq;earthen
ve&s;&s;els,&endq; in which &startq;we have&endq; it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 7.</NOTE>; the weight
of the functions, with your unworthine&s;s and the
&s;lenderne&s;s of your abilities; the eternal con&s;e|quences
which are &s;u&s;pended on your performance
of them, with the weakne&s;s of the means which
you can u&s;e. The compari&s;on forced the great
apo&s;tle of the gentiles to exclaim, &startq;And who is
&s;ufficient for the&s;e things<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Chap. ii. 16.</NOTE>?&endq; The compari&s;on,
&s;eriou&s;ly made, will lead you to undertake this
office with diffidence, to be conver&s;ant in it with
<PB N="28" REF="35">
awe, and in all its duties to &startq;&s;erve the Lord with
all humility of mind<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 19.</NOTE>.&endq; Such a &s;en&s;e of the
dignity of your profe&s;&s;ion, carefully formed, &s;tea|dily
maintained, &s;tudiou&s;ly cheri&s;hed, and inva|riably
acted upon, will have the happie&s;t influence
on your views, on your exertions, and on your
whole character: and that the more effectually,
the higher it is rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>A well-formed &s;en&s;e of the importance of your
profe&s;&s;ion will re$ine and elevate your views and
aims in choo&s;ing, in undertaking, and in executing
it. It nece&s;&s;arily includes an impre&s;&s;ion of the im|portance
of the end of your profe&s;&s;ion. To pro|mote
that end, will be your principal view in en|tering
upon it, and your leading aim in exerci&s;ing
it. You will think of entering on it, with a con|&s;iderable
degree of deliberation; and when you
determine to undertake it, it will be with a &s;incere
and &s;upreme de&s;ire, and an ardent concern, to
contribute all you can to the improvement and the
&s;alvation of the &s;ouls of men. Liable as all men
are to indi&s;po&s;ition, depre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;traction of
thought, it will require pains to keep &s;o &s;ublime
an end con&s;tantly in view, and to act with a &s;teady
regard to it. A lively &s;en&s;e of its moment is the
only means of &s;urmounting the difficulty. This
will lead you to think explicitly of it very frequent|ly;
<PB N="29" REF="36">
and it will enable you to have an habitual eye
to it, even when you do not actually think of it.
It will be in perpetual readine&s;s to occur to you,
and that with &s;uch force as to determine you to
contrive how every mini&s;tration may be performed
in the way fitte&s;t to promote it. Attention to &s;o
&s;ublime an end will prevent your ever &s;ubordi|nating
any of the pa&s;toral functions to bye-ends,
to worldly intere&s;t, or to the gratification of a &s;a|vourite
pa&s;&s;ion. It will prevent your directing any
of your performances merely to the di&s;play of your
own talents, to courting the favour of the great,
or to &s;crambling for popularity among the multi|tude.
It will excite you to exert your powers,
only that you may do the greater good; to
&startq;plea&s;e&endq; others only for their &startq;edification<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 2.</NOTE>,&endq;
only when it is right to plea&s;e them, and would be
wrong not to plea&s;e them. Concern to accompli&s;h
the end of your profe&s;&s;ion, is too noble a principle
to admit any partner&s;hip with mean de&s;igns. It
implies love to God, affection to Chri&s;t, the highe&s;t
&s;pecies of benevolence, benevolence to the &s;ouls of
men, zeal for the advancement of religion, a con|viction
of the incomparable importance of eternity,
all united together, deriving power from, and im|parting
it to, one another. The&s;e will be in &s;ome
degree the principles and views of every ingenuous
candidate; whoever is wholly de&s;titute of them,
mu&s;t be unworthy to bear the &s;acred character:
<PB N="30" REF="37">
the&s;e will be the principles and views of all who
are duly affected with the importance of the office,
and the great &s;prings and regulators of all their ex|ertions
in their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of the importance of the pa&s;toral office,
enlightened by a di&s;tinct appreher&s;ion of the na|ture
of that importance, will add &s;pirit to all your
endeavours, both in preparing your&s;elves for it,
and in executing it. Not dreaming that it has
&s;uch &s;anctity as can of it&s;elf confer virtue on the
ordinances which it is employed in di&s;pen&s;ing, you
cannot expect that they will have virtue and effi|cacy,
if you be incapable of di&s;pen&s;ing them aright,
or if you be not careful to do &s;o. Important
functions &s;hould not be performed negligently,
and cannot be performed without the proper abi|lities.
Sen&s;ible of the importance of yours, if you
have any regard to duty or propriety, you will
decline no application that is nece&s;&s;ary to accom|pli&s;h
you for them, however laborious it may be,
or whatever length of time it may require. Till
you be con&s;cious that you are &s;ufficiently accom|pli&s;hed
for them, you will by no means think of
undertaking them. Without diligent application,
no man can excel, or even make a tolerable figure
in the very meane&s;t profe&s;&s;ion: and can a man be
&s;it for &s;o excellent an occupation, without being
indefatigable in acquiring the knowlege and habits
requi&s;ite for exerci&s;ing it? The teacher of all
truth and goodne&s;s, cannot be formed in a day.
<PB N="31" REF="38">
The importance of his office demands that he be
a&s;&s;iduous in rendering him&s;elf fitter for it every
day, and ready to undergo any labour that can be
conducive to his di&s;charging it in the be&s;t manner.
It may be ea&s;y to go through all the duties of that
office, &s;o as not to incur the imputation of omitting
them, without entering into the true &s;pirit of any
one of them: but to be &s;atisfied with this, is in|con&s;i&s;tent
with your either valuing or loving your
profe&s;&s;ion. The &s;en&s;e that its duties are in their
very nature worthy and honourable employments,
will not only prompt you to bring to them the re|qui&s;ite
accompli&s;hments, but al&s;o &s;upport and en|liven
you in the performance of them. Mean ex|erci&s;es
a man enters on with reluctance, and per|forms
with regret and languor: he is a&s;hamed of
them, and by &s;hame his efforts are repre&s;&s;ed, and
his indu&s;try enervated. But you need not be
a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, or of the office
of preaching it: you may glory in preaching it,
and with con&s;cious elevation &s;tretch all your facul|ties
in preaching it. The &s;en&s;e that all the pa&s;toral
functions are directly &s;ub&s;ervient to the greate&s;t of
all ends, the purity, perfection, and happine&s;s of
immortal beings, will determine you to adapt all
your &s;tudies and exerci&s;es to that end; to avoid
barren &s;peculations, frivolous controver&s;ies, &s;ubtle
and unedifying que&s;tions; not to &s;eek after what
may plea&s;e the imagination, gratify the curio&s;ity,
or humour the prejudices of the people: but to
inculcate only the &s;imple doctrine of the go&s;pel,
<PB N="32" REF="39">
which tends wholly to &s;anctification, and to &s;et
every part of it in tho&s;e points of view, in which
it has the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to affect the heart, im|prove
the temper, influence the practice, and thus
fit men for eternal life. From a lively impre&s;&s;ion
of the connexion of your functions with this end,
and of their nece&s;&s;ity to the people, what ardor,
zeal, alacrity, and diligence in performing them,
mu&s;t ari&s;e? It will make you cheerfully continue
and increa&s;e your labours, and never give them
over, till you have accompli&s;hed their end, at lea&s;t
till you have freed your&s;elves from blame, though
they &s;hould fail of actually reaching it.</P>
<P>A lively &s;en&s;e of the genuine importance of the
pa&s;toral office will have a great influence on the
whole of your character. It will powerfully in&s;ti|gate
you to all goodne&s;s. It implies a &s;en&s;e of the
importance of eternal &s;alvation, which is the end
of all the functions of that office. And with this
in your view, can you be but concerned for your
own &s;alvation, and careful to &s;ecure it? Can you
indulge your&s;elves in &s;in, which mu&s;t forfeit it, or
neglect that holine&s;s without which it cannot be
obtained? Salvation is the mo&s;t commanding ob|ject
that you can hold forth to others, for coun|teracting
the temptations of the world, for baffling
the power of &s;in, for &s;urmounting the difficulties
of religion, for encouraging them to climb the
heights of virtue: and if you your&s;elves have a
con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of it, it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould
<PB N="33" REF="40">
have no influence on your own temper and con|duct.
It will be your very bu&s;ine&s;s, to teach men,
in all po&s;&s;ible ways, &startq;the doctrine which is ac|cording
to godline&s;s<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">I Tim. vi. 3.</NOTE>:&endq; can you teach it with|out
&s;tudying it? and can you make it the bu&s;ine&s;s
of your lives to &s;tudy it, without feeling any thing
of its power in forming your&s;elves to godline&s;s?
It is doubtle&s;s po&s;&s;ible to go through the functions
of the pa&s;toral office, without their having any
effect on your own &s;ouls: but it is not po&s;&s;ible to
perform them with due attention to their nature,
or a real con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their tendency, without
their having a great effect. They are the means
which infinite wi&s;dom has ordained for reforming
and &s;anctifying the world: and can you uprightly
employ your&s;elves in applying them to this pur|po&s;e,
and yet your&s;elves remain totally unreformed
and un&s;anctified? A &s;en&s;e of the ju&s;t importance
of the pa&s;toral office, impre&s;&s;ed on the heart, will
form you, not only to goodne&s;s, but to dignity
of character and demeanour. A &s;tation of dignity
requires dignity of character: and it is the true&s;t
dignity of character, that the &s;tation of mini&s;ters
requires. This is widely different from that &s;tate|line&s;s
and haughtine&s;s which highly mi&s;become
them, but which &s;ome have affected in its &s;tead:
it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the lowlie&s;t humility;
<PB N="34" REF="41">
nay, in the exertions of genuine humility, it is
often mo&s;t con&s;picuous. It exalts the &s;oul, but
elates it not; it produces conde&s;cen&s;ion, not a&s;|&s;uming;
affability, not di&s;tance: it di&s;gu&s;ts not
the mo&s;t jealous &s;pectator; it forces approbation,
and commands e&s;teem. The apo&s;tle certainly had
it in his eye, when he directed, not to the people,
but to the mini&s;ter, the exhortation, &startq;Let no
man de&s;pi&s;e thee<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 15. 1 Tim. iv. 12.</NOTE>.&endq; It is nothing el&s;e but
eminence of virtue. It is founded on a &s;trong
perception of the excellence of virtue and the ba&s;e|ne&s;s
of vice, and on a permanent &s;en&s;e of the
vanity of pre&s;ent outward things, and the un|&s;peakable
moment of things &s;piritual and eternal.
It &s;hews it&s;elf in a &s;uperiority to all the allurements
of &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t, whenever they are incon|&s;i&s;tent
with &s;trict virtue; in liberty from the do|minion
of vice, which is the lowe&s;t degradation of
a rea&s;onable &s;oul; in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and vigorous
exerci&s;e of a high degree of piety, benevolence,
and every worthy affection; in di&s;daining to &s;peak
or do any thing which betrays mean &s;entiments,
little views, or wrong pa&s;&s;ions; in being above
blu&s;hing to perform offices &s;eemingly the lowe&s;t,
whenever they are u&s;eful to the body or the &s;oul
of any man, or conducive to the intere&s;ts of reli|gion.
This is true dignity of character: and this
is the dignity, and the only dignity, to which
<PB N="35" REF="42">
your profe&s;&s;ion can naturally prompt you to a&s;pire.
A proper conception of the end of that profe&s;&s;ion
will kindle your ambition for it; acquaintance
with the &s;ubject of your profe&s;&s;ion, will form you
to it; a&s;&s;iduity in the duties of your profe&s;&s;ion,
will draw it out into con&s;tant exertion, and by
con&s;tant exertion will confirm and perfect it. But
the foundation both of goodne&s;s and of dignity of
character mu&s;t be laid early. A per&s;on under the
full power of tho&s;e &s;entiments which flow from a
&s;en&s;e of the excellence of the pa&s;toral office, will,
from the fir&s;t moment that he thinks of choo&s;ing
it, &s;tudy to act in every re&s;pect &s;uitably to its true
genius. He will &s;tudy to pre&s;erve that manner
from the very fir&s;t, which would be graceful and
becoming if he were already inve&s;ted with the
&s;acred character of a mini&s;ter of religion, in his
actions, in his words, in his whole behaviour.
Whatever would be declared by the general &s;en&s;e
of mankind indecent in a clergyman, can never
be altogether decent in a per&s;on who intends to be
a clergyman. Any behaviour un&s;uitable to the
character which you hope &s;oon to bear, can pro|ceed
only, either from blameable thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s,
from a turn of mind ill corre&s;ponding to it, or
from a de&s;ire not to have it known that you are
de&s;igned for that profe&s;&s;ion. All the&s;e are incon|&s;i&s;tent
with a due &s;en&s;e of its dignity and import|ance;
which will produce in you a con&s;tant &s;oli|citude
to &s;peak and act worthy of it; and will
<PB N="36" REF="43">
effectually prevent your running into any &s;pecies
of conduct which can imply, that you are a&s;hamed
of it, or that you do not reckon it your greate&s;t
honour to be preparing for it, or engaged in it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the E&s;teem due to the Pa&s;toral Office.</HEAD>
<P>IT is incumbent, not only on tho&s;e who occupy
or a&s;pire to the pa&s;toral office, but likewi&s;e on all
others, to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its dignity and im|portance.
Becau&s;e it is both excellent in it&s;elf,
and highly beneficial to the people, they are
obliged to e&s;teem it, and to think highly of it.
We are affected towards all offices, according to
our opinion of their nature: we look with con|tempt
on tho&s;e which we reckon mean; we re|&s;pect
tho&s;e which we reckon honourable or im|portant:
we feel the&s;e &s;entiments though we our|&s;elves
have no connexion with &s;uch offices. If the
moment of the pa&s;toral office be mea&s;ured by the
rank which it gives in the pre&s;ent world, or the
emoluments which it yields, men can have but a
low opinion of it. But the&s;e are not the &s;tandards
by which its dignity &s;hould be e&s;timated. Its bu|&s;ine&s;s
is to teach religion; its end is to promote
the eternal happine&s;s of mankind: its intrin&s;ic
dignity is in proportion to the&s;e purpo&s;es; and in
proportion to men's &s;en&s;e of the excellence of
<PB N="37" REF="44">
the&s;e, their e&s;teem of it will always be. If the&s;e
appear to men, as they really are, infinitely nobler
and more momentous than all earthly riches and
honours, they cannot entertain a low idea of the
pa&s;toral office. This would be to think meanly
of the go&s;pel, which is the &s;ubject of it, and to &s;et
little value on eternal happine&s;s, which is its aim.
This is incon&s;i&s;tent with men's being Chri&s;tians.
It demon&s;trates a ba&s;e perver&s;ion and depravation
of &s;entiment. It would be inexcu&s;able, though
the pa&s;toral office had no immediate relation to
them&s;elves. But when it has the neare&s;t relation
to them&s;elves; when it is for teaching them the
go&s;pel, and promoting their &s;alvation, that this
office is in&s;tituted; when, con&s;idering their want
of lei&s;ure and opportunities, they could &s;carce at
all obtain the&s;e purpo&s;es without it; when they
are &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in it, and that for pur|po&s;es
of &s;uch un&s;peakable con&s;equence to their
&s;ouls; not to hold it in high e&s;teem, &s;hows not
merely in&s;en&s;ibility to its nature, but al&s;o indif|ference
about their own mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts;
tho&s;e eternal intere&s;ts, indifference about which is
a complication of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t folly and the ba&s;e&s;t
degeneracy of &s;oul. Such extravagant or mi&s;taken
notions of the dignity or the &s;anctity of the pa&s;toral
office, as were formerly mentioned, would produce
a blind and &s;uper&s;titious veneration of it, as per|nicious
in its con&s;equences as the want of all re|&s;pect
for it. It is only a value for it, founded on
a di&s;tinct conception of its real utility, and cor|re&s;pondent
<PB N="38" REF="45">
to it, that either is due, or can be
profitable.</P>
<P>The importance of the pa&s;toral office demands
likewi&s;e from the people, re&s;pect for tho&s;e who
bear it. The&s;e two &s;entiments, a value for the
office, and e&s;teem of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it worthily,
are in&s;eparable, and mu&s;t in every man be in
exact proportion to one another: they who are
&s;en&s;ible of the importance of the work, and of its
utility to them, will &startq;for the work's &s;ake e&s;teem
them very highly in love,&endq; who labour in it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. v. 13.</NOTE>.
In whatever belongs to their office, they are &s;u|perior
to the people and have an authority over
them; this implies a right to corre&s;pondent re&s;pect
and deference, the refu&s;al of which is a failure in
duty. Whenever mini&s;ters are exerci&s;ing their
office, they are doing &s;omething for the in&s;truction,
the &s;anctification, or the &s;alvation of the people:
and by being employed for purpo&s;es &s;o beneficial
to them, they cannot but be entitled to their af|fection
and gratitude. To refu&s;e the&s;e attach|ments,
is to declare that they reckon the&s;e no
&s;ervices. Love and e&s;teem will add force to one
another, and will lead them to treat mini&s;ters both
with re&s;pect and kindne&s;s, and to do them all the
good offices in their power, with an acknowleged
&s;en&s;e that they are due to them. An implicit de|pendence
<PB N="39" REF="46">
on the opinions and &s;entiments of mi|ni&s;ters,
a &s;uper&s;titious dread of puni&s;hing their
crimes, or of vindicating the rights of other men
again&s;t them, a &s;illy admiration of them, as if they
were beings of an higher order or endued with
&s;upernatural powers, are no parts of the deference
that is due to them; they will be paid only by the
ignorant or the deluded, and accepted only by the
weak or the de&s;igning; they are warranted by
nothing in the real nature of the pa&s;toral office:
but it does demand that rational e&s;teem and love
for tho&s;e who di&s;charge it uprightly, which is
proportioned to its moment, and congruous to its
functions.</P>
<P>A per&s;on may, doubtle&s;s, by behaving un|worthily
in his office, forfeit the e&s;teem to which
it would have otherwi&s;e entitled him. In this
ca&s;e, the very importance of the office which he
holds, will render him the more contemptible, or
the more dete&s;table. But a real value for the
pa&s;toral office will give &s;ome check to the &s;everity
of men's cen&s;ures, and will often even prevent
them. It is plain that they who have lea&s;t re&s;pect
to the office, are generally the mo&s;t forward to
find fault with individuals belonging to it, and the
readie&s;t to pronounce that they have forfeited their
title to e&s;teem. And by the manner of expre&s;&s;ing
their contempt or indignation again&s;t individuals,
they betray the principles by which they are ac|tuated:
they expre&s;s it with plea&s;ure or exultation,
<PB N="40" REF="47">
with &s;light or acrimony again&s;t the office it&s;elf, or
&s;ometimes even with a &s;ort of triumph over religion.
Indeed, per&s;ons of very oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions &s;ome|times
&s;hew the &s;ame propen&s;ity to undervalue or to
cen&s;ure individuals of the clergy. It is often ob|&s;ervable
in tho&s;e who profe&s;s a high &s;en&s;e of the
importance and &s;anctity of the office, and great
zeal for the intere&s;ts of religion. Their idea of
the office is &s;o over&s;trained as to make them exact
from tho&s;e that hold it more than is rea&s;onable,
and expect more than is practicable: or their zeal
for religion is of a fal&s;e and fiery kind, embittering
their &s;pirits, and rankling them into malevolence:
or their religion it&s;elf is of a &s;purious kind, di&s;|po&s;ing
them to con&s;ider indifferent things as wrong,
and trivial things as momentous: or their pre|tences
to religion are hypocritical, and overdone
in order to conceal the impo&s;ition. A real and
ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the importance of the pa&s;toral office,
will extingui&s;h the propen&s;ity to &s;eek for faults in
mini&s;ters; and, when faults are con&s;picuous, will
mix the cen&s;ure of them with regret, concern, and
tenderne&s;s. It is not every failing, or every im|perfection
in virtue, that can forfeit any part of the
e&s;teem due to a mini&s;ter on account of his office:
for fallibility and imperfection are the characteri&s;|tics
of human nature in this mortal &s;tate. If it
could, God would never have commanded to
e&s;teem them. Men's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own
faults &s;hould lead them to expect &s;ome in mi|ni&s;ters,
di&s;po&s;e them to bear with them, and not
<PB N="41" REF="48">
ea&s;ily to contract prejudices again&s;t them. They
are men like other men; they live in the world,
be&s;et with the like temptations; it is not rea&s;on|able

perfection of angels<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stillingfle$t, Eccle&s;ia&s;t. Ca&s;es, vol. i. p. 105.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A ju&s;t and well-regulated e&s;teem of the pa&s;toral
office, and of tho&s;e who occupy it, will render men
well affected to all their mini&s;trations in it. In
whatever degree that office is important, in the
very &s;ame degree it is of con&s;equence for men to
attend upon the functions of it. If it be de&s;igned
for promoting their mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, and
if they think highly of it on this account, they
mu&s;t attend upon its functions; for without this it
can be of no advantage to them. An opinion that
the pa&s;toral functions operate as it were magically,
merely by being performed and attended upon,
produces, in tho&s;e who entertain it, a high value
for them, and a &s;crupulous punctuality in attend|ing
on them: but as it &s;prings from a wrong prin|ciple,
it mu&s;t likewi&s;e have a wrong direction. If
a rational per&s;ua&s;ion of their real utility produce
not as great an e&s;teem of them, and a&s;&s;iduity in
them, it mu&s;t be owing to its being too weak, or
too little reflected upon. But the degree of re|gard
to them, which &s;prings from &s;uch a per&s;ua|&s;ion,
whatever it is, will at lea&s;t be properly di|rected.
<PB N="42" REF="49">
It will not be merely formal; it will be
be&s;towed with a &s;ingle view to apply them all to
them&s;elves, and with care to render them profit|able
for their in&s;truction and improvement. Every
in&s;tance of di&s;regard to the functions of mini&s;ters
betrays a defect in men's value for their office;
and every failure in improving by their functions,

<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit leads men to &s;eek out the faults
of individuals of the clergy, to exaggerate and &s;et
them in the mo&s;t invidious lights, and to publi&s;h
them with a malicious eagerne&s;s and exultation.
Imaginary faults are converted into real vices;
&s;mall failings are exalted into atrocious crimes;
and great blemi&s;hes are condemned with the mo&s;t
&s;piteful bitterne&s;s, and without making the lea&s;t
allowance for the weakne&s;s of human nature, or
the temptations of the world. They often are not
&s;atisfied with bitterne&s;s again&s;t the individuals who
<PB N="44" REF="51">
are guilty: they impute them to the whole order;
they take every occa&s;ion of ridiculing and re|proaching
all who belong to it. It cannot be de|nied
that there is a real propen&s;ity in human na|ture,
to a&s;cribe the character of &s;ome individuals
with whom we are be&s;t acquainted, to the whole
&s;ociety of which they are members. This is a
&s;pecies of inference which it is impo&s;&s;ible wholly
to avoid; for it is derived from that mental prin|ciple
which di&s;po&s;es us to form general rules of
judging, and from which many of our mo&s;t im|portant
intellectual operations proceed. But when|ever
we form a general rule ha&s;tily, without having
experience in a &s;ufficient number of in&s;tances;
whenever we apply the conclu&s;ion to individuals
di&s;&s;imilar to tho&s;e of whom we had experience, in
the circum&s;tances on which the conclu&s;ion was ori|ginally
founded, however like they may be in
other circum&s;tances; whenever we do not exerci&s;e
judgment in allowing the nece&s;&s;ary exceptions;
that principle leads us into mere prejudices, in&s;tead
of ju&s;t conclu&s;ions. From whatever cau&s;e the un|fairne&s;s
proceeds, it is certain that our general
rules concerning characters, are much oftener
founded on the faults than on the virtues of men,
that we are readier to de&s;cribe a &s;ociety or nation,
by the blemi&s;hes than by the excellences of &s;uch
individuals belonging to it as we are acquainted
with. It is obvious too, that men impute the
faults of individual clergymen to the whole order,
more generally, more confidently, and with le&s;s

<P>But the &s;pirit of di&s;affection re&s;ts not even here.
The faults of the clergy are charged on religion
it&s;elf: the contempt of their office grows into con|tempt
of religion. If men be di&s;&s;atisfied with a
particular lawyer or phy&s;ician, they commonly
content them&s;elves at the utmo&s;t with blaming all
who are of the profe&s;&s;ion; they &s;eldom go &s;o far
as, on account of the faults of the practitioners,
to call in que&s;tion the virtues of medicines, or the
utility of curing di&s;ea&s;es, to revile the laws of the
land, or the in&s;titution of civil government. But,
not &s;atisfied with de&s;pi&s;ing or reproaching the
whole clerical order for the vices of a few indivi|duals,
they would make the religion which they
teach an&s;werable for them, and expre&s;s &s;u&s;picions
concerning the truth, the excellence, the import|ance,
or the practicability of the go&s;pel. There
may be circum&s;tances which give a &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s
to this partiality, and betray men thoughtle&s;sly
into it: but &s;till it is an unrea&s;onable partiality,
and &s;eems to proceed in a great mea&s;ure from this,
that the depravity of men makes them more eager
to find out &s;omething to the di&s;credit of religion,
than to that of the &s;ubject of any other profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="53">
When men's contempt of the clergy proceeds
not &s;o far as to the contempt of all religion, yet
it often &s;hews it&s;elf in a contempt of their mini|&s;trations,
and indifference for attendance on them.
The&s;e two things, contempt of their per&s;ons and
neglect of their mini&s;trations, are nearly connected:
the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y from the one to the other.
Both imply an in&s;en&s;ibility to the importance of
the end and functions of the office. When men
are in any way prejudiced again&s;t the per&s;on, they
cannot have a great re&s;pect to his labours, nor the
expectation of much advantage from them.</P>
<P>Contempt of the pa&s;toral office is very common
in all the&s;e forms. Whence can &s;entiments pro|ceed
&s;o repugnant to tho&s;e that are naturally due
to its excellence and importance? They proceed,
in different ca&s;es, from different cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In&s;idelity is one very natural cau&s;e of &s;entiments
either of contempt or of rancour again&s;t the pa&s;|toral
office and tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it. Athei&s;ts,
who regard all religion as weakne&s;s and &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
and infidels, who look on revelation as an
impo&s;ture, a fal&s;e and pernicious &s;uperaddition to
natural religion, cannot have a great e&s;teem for the
office of the teachers of religion. They mu&s;t of
cour&s;e either de&s;pi&s;e them as weakly credulous, or
di&s;like them as deceivers, carrying on a di&s;hone&s;t
craft, impo&s;ing upon men doctrines which them|&s;elves
believe not, and rules of conduct which
<PB N="47" REF="54">
them&s;elves know to be of no obligation. The&s;e
are the only &s;entiments which they can con&s;i&s;tently
entertain. But in them alone they can appear
con&s;i&s;tent or rea&s;onable. In all who profe&s;s to
believe the go&s;pel, to regard it as a divine reve|lation
of true religion, of a &s;tupendous di&s;pen&s;a|tion
carried on by God, from the foundation of
the world, for the &s;alvation of mankind, and exe|cuted
by the mo&s;t wonderful means; it never can
be rea&s;onable to &s;light the office of teaching reli|gion,
of propagating the principles and inculcating
the practice of Chri&s;tianity, or to undervalue tho&s;e
who are employed in it. To de&s;pi&s;e the order in
general, is to de&s;pi&s;e the work, and to de&s;pi&s;e the
go&s;pel which they them&s;elves believe; for the go&s;|pel
is both the &s;ource and the &s;ubject of the em|ployment
of that order. This is ab&s;urdity and in|con&s;i&s;tence
in the extreme: but it is very far from
being uncommon<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In &s;uch, the contempt of the clergy &s;ometimes
ari&s;es from the contagion of the &s;pirit of infidelity.
The prevalence of infidelity often corrupts the &s;en|timents
and practice of tho&s;e who&s;e faith it cannot
ab&s;olutely &s;ubvert. Men adopt the maxims of in|fidels
without perceiving their con&s;equences; they
catch &s;omething of their &s;pirit, while they reject
their principles. While &s;peculative tenets often
<PB N="48" REF="55">
have not a great or con&s;tant influence on the beha|viour,
&s;ympathy is &s;o &s;trong in human nature, that
it leads us to enter readily into the &s;entiments and
opinions of others, and to receive them by a kind
of infection, without con&s;idering how far they are
con&s;i&s;tent with our own real belief. By this means,
the contempt and ridicule which infidels are na|turally
led by their tenets to pour out upon the
mini&s;ters of religion, diffu&s;es it&s;elf and &s;preads the
&s;ame &s;pirit among tho&s;e who, by their own princi|ples,
ought to honour them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Attachment to vicious habits and practices, not|with&s;tanding
a belief of the Chri&s;tian religion, is
another very natural cau&s;e of di&s;re&s;pect or aver|&s;ion
to the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing
that they who are addicted to wickedne&s;s, &s;hould
di&s;like tho&s;e who endeavour to check wickedne&s;s;
or that they who hate to be reformed, &s;hould hate
tho&s;e who&s;e very bu&s;ine&s;s it is to labour to reform
them. Corruption of manners is often both a
cau&s;e and an effect of the contempt of the mini|&s;ters
of religion. Men's acknowlegement of the
religion which they teach, cannot be expected to
prevent their contempt, any more than it has pre|vented
their own depravity; for it is not more
contradictory to the former than to the latter.
Per&s;ons of abandoned morals cannot &s;et a proper
<PB N="49" REF="56">
value on the per&s;ons or the office of mini&s;ters,
except they conceived a virtue in their functions,
to &s;ecure their &s;alvation without their being obliged
to relinqui&s;h their vices; and this mi&s;taken con|ception
has &s;ometimes led men of &s;uch morals to
an extravagant adulation or admiration of the
clergy, and a &s;uper&s;titious dependence on their
functions; as dangerous to them&s;elves, and as
di&s;gu&s;ting to them, as the mo&s;t open contempt or
di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Even too low a &s;en&s;e of the excellence and
moment of religion, though not accompanied by
gro&s;s immorality, will &s;ink men's e&s;teem of the
pa&s;toral office. As long as men are &s;o inattentive
to the importance of eternity, as to be drawn
off from a due regard to it by every prevailing
pa&s;&s;ion or pre&s;ent intere&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible that
they can have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the importance of an
office, which is dignified chiefly by its being
calculated for training men up for eternity. Accu&s;|tomed
to e&s;timate every thing according to its
value in this world, they will re&s;pect the pa&s;toral
office only in proportion to the degree of rank,
or weight, or influence, which it gives the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or
in civil &s;ociety; and con&s;equently their re&s;pect will
be both too low, and of a kind that is im|proper
and incongruous to the real nature of the
office.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="57">
Differences of opinion in matters of religion
&s;ometimes contribute very powerfully to &s;ome
&s;ort of contempt of the clergy. The adherents
to one &s;ect, bigotedly attached to its peculiarities,
and violently &s;et again&s;t all who differ from them,
direct their &s;pite principally again&s;t the mini&s;ters of
other &s;ects; reproach them as irreligious or enthu|&s;ia&s;ts,
as loo&s;e or over-rigid, as fools or hypocrites,
according as circum&s;tances give the ea&s;ie&s;t handle
for one charge or another. Such abu&s;es have
been reciprocally heaped by different parties and
different churches on the teachers of each other.
Every difference in the &s;ituation of the&s;e teachers
has been turned by the re&s;t into a reproach again&s;t
them: their faults have been &s;earched out, di&s;co|vered
with joy, exaggerated without mercy, and
turned into rea&s;ons for contempt or aver&s;ion
towards all the teachers of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion.
The di&s;&s;entions of tho&s;e who ought to have con&s;i|dered
them&s;elves as brethren, have been greedily
laid hold of by the enemies of religion, received
with an eager faith, retorted upon them all, and
improved into a confe&s;&s;ion, that the mini&s;ters of
any denomination cannot be entitled to much
e&s;teem. Some &s;ects of Chri&s;tians, being mi&s;led by
&s;ome of their peculiar principles to di&s;claim the
mini&s;try as a &s;eparate office or profe&s;&s;ion, have, in
con&s;equence of this, profe&s;&s;edly de&s;pi&s;ed all who
have devoted them&s;elves to the exerci&s;e of it; and
in their ridicule or invective again&s;t them, have
<PB N="51" REF="58">
&s;ometimes equalled, or even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, the open
enemies of all religion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Barclay's Apology. Letters on Theron and A&s;pa&s;ia.</NOTE> On the other hand, the
rai&s;ing the mea&s;ures of the pa&s;toral duty too high,

of the office, tends directly to produce contempt or
di&s;affection towards tho&s;e who occupy it. Fo&s;ter|ing
in men an expectation of more from mini&s;ters,

that they have done enough, and will be di&s;&s;atisfied

without any &s;ettled ill de&s;ign. The gay and

their wit and humour. The beari&s;h will lay hold
of it, as offering a de&s;irable opportunity of venting
their rudene&s;s without giving general offence.
Some will affect it as a mark of politene&s;s, of
freedom of &s;entiment, of &s;uperiority to vulgar
prejudices, of exemption from &s;uper&s;tition: and

their functions, hope to exalt them&s;elves as above
the need of any in&s;truction or direction from them.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59">
When the &s;pirit of contempt of mini&s;ters, and
of their office, has become prevalent, no &s;ituation,
no behaviour can procure them that honour and
re&s;pect to which it entitles them. If by the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of religion to which they belong,
honours and riches be annexed to their office, they
are reproached as proud, ambitious, and covetous.
If their provi&s;ion be &s;canty, they are de&s;pi&s;ed for
their poverty, and charged with meanne&s;s of
&s;pirit, and ungenteelne&s;s of appearance. If they
are &s;erious and grave, it is con&s;trued into grimace,
hypocri&s;y, or moro&s;ene&s;s. If they are cheerful
and lively, it is mi&s;repre&s;ented as unbecoming
levity, or even an indication of their having no
&s;en&s;e of religion. The cau&s;es of all this lie not in
them&s;elves; el&s;e, by removing them, they might
avoid it: but they lie in the giddine&s;s, the vices,
or the prejudices of others, which they have it not
in their power to correct, and which the&s;e unfa|vourable
&s;entiments of them, in a great mea&s;ure,
cut them off from opportunity of endeavouring to
correct. The&s;e cau&s;es too are &s;o various and even
oppo&s;ite in different men, that if they e&s;cape con|tempt
from one quarter, they may lay their account
with cen&s;ure from another, and perhaps the more
for the very means by which they have contrived
to make that e&s;cape. All that they have in their
power is, to prepare them&s;elves for bearing it, and
to behave with propriety under it.</P>

religion, and yet betray it. Let never your con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of the unde&s;erved contempt with which
your profe&s;&s;ion is commonly treated, induce you
to &s;peak a word, or do an action, which can be
con&s;idered as in&s;inuating that you have a mean opi|nion
of it, or little value for it. This would increa&s;e
their contempt of you, and render you de&s;erving
of it. This additional contempt you have great
rea&s;on to be &s;olicitous to avoid; and you will mo&s;t
&s;ucce&s;sfully avoid it by making the worthy clergy|man

man always con&s;picuous in your demeanour. But
that contempt which is directed primarily again&s;t
your profe&s;&s;ion, and only rebounds on you as
belonging to it, when you recollect the cau&s;es
from which it proceeds, you certainly cannot be
&s;olicitous to avoid; for if it were po&s;&s;ible, it could
be avoided only by your being a&s;&s;imilated to the

<P>In&s;tead of vainly endeavouring to avoid it by
improper means, turn it to your advantage. If
properly con&s;idered, it may be rendered produc|tive
of very beneficial effects on your temper and
behaviour. A ju&s;t and well-formed &s;en&s;e of the
contempt with which you and your office are liable
to be treated, will teach you not to expect all that
honour which the importance of the &s;acred func|tions
might claim; and by preventing the expect|ation
of it, will prevent the pain and mortification
of di&s;appointment, when you mi&s;s it. It will forbid
your laying claim to exce&s;&s;ive re&s;pect or authority,
by making you certain that it would be refu&s;ed,
perhaps with redoubled &s;light and ridicule. You
&s;hould never indeed allow, or &s;eem to allow, that
your profe&s;&s;ion is trivial or de&s;picable; for this
<PB N="56" REF="63">
would be to betray its rights: and it$ is doubtle&s;s
proper at &s;ome times explicitly to vindicate it, and
avow its dignity. This is permitted to per&s;ons of
all other profe&s;&s;ions. The meane&s;t artificer is not
blamed for &s;peaking of the real degree of utility
which his trade po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es: a magi&s;trate or judge
may, without incurring cen&s;ure, claim and enforce
the honour that is due to his office. It is only
when men would give dignity to mean employ|ments,
or challenge, to &s;uch as are honourable, a
re&s;pect in its nature un&s;uitable, or in its mea&s;ure
extravagant, that they meet with either ridicule or
di&s;approbation. It cannot therefore be rea&s;onable
to in&s;i&s;t, that mini&s;ters alone &s;hould leave mankind
to throw unde&s;erved contempt, not only upon
them&s;elves, but upon their office al&s;o, without
daring to tell them that they are in the wrong. It
is even le&s;s rea&s;onable to expect it from them than
from men of any other profe&s;&s;ion: it is directly
their bu&s;ine&s;s to point out the various duties of
men; and it cannot be incumbent on them, or
even allowable in them, to pa&s;s by tho&s;e duties of
which the pa&s;toral office is the object. Regard to
the go&s;pel forbids it; it would be to &s;uffer, without
reproof, an office to be vilified, which has its
foundation in the go&s;pel. Regard to men's own
&s;ouls forbids it; it would be to &s;uffer an office,
which was intended for their edification, to become
of no advantage to them, by their learning to
de&s;pi&s;e it. The mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of men,
their &s;piritual improvement and their everla&s;ting
<PB N="57" REF="64">
happine&s;s, may be very much affected by the
&s;entiments which they entertain of their Chri&s;tian
teachers. Yet it is certain, however unrea&s;onable,
that &s;uch a vindication of our profe&s;&s;ion as would
be readily allowed to others, would by many be
cen&s;ured as prie&s;tly pride and a&s;&s;uming haughtine&s;s.
On this account, even when it becomes mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t be undertaken with great caution
and prudence. You mu&s;t not claim any honour,
either improper and undue in its kind, or extra|vagant
in its degree; nor even any honour that
can, with plau&s;ibility, be &s;u&s;pected of being &s;uch.
You mu&s;t expre&s;s your demands with great care
and preci&s;ion, avoiding every term that is pompous
or inde&s;inite. You mu&s;t rather keep con&s;iderably
below what truth and ju&s;tice evidently warrant.
And with all this re&s;erve, you mu&s;t &s;how no anxiety
to enter upon the &s;ubject, but touch it very
&s;paringly, and only when a proper occa&s;ion invites
it. You will mo&s;t effectually gain re&s;pect by not
being over-eager to claim it. A proper &s;en&s;e of the
contempt with which the pa&s;toral office is too com|monly
treated, will likewi&s;e check the pride and
vanity which the con&s;ideration of its importance
might excite in light and incon&s;iderate per&s;ons,
who do not &s;ufficiently reflect on the true nature
of that importance. Serving as a counterbalance
to the&s;e, it will have a direct and powerful tendency
to form you to a temper of humility. It will accu&s;|tom
you neither to court nor to &s;et a high value on
the opinions and applau&s;es of men; not to act
<PB N="58" REF="65">
with a view to them, but from a regard to what is
right in it&s;elf, to the approbation of your own
minds, and the unerring judgment of God. By
con&s;tantly laying your account with it, that you
&s;hall incur part of the contempt which is &s;o liberally
ca&s;t on your profe&s;&s;ion, you will be prepared for
bearing unju&s;t reproach and obloquy without being
provoked or exa&s;perated, and to &s;ubmit to it with
patience and meekne&s;s. It will give you ample
&s;cope for exerci&s;ing the&s;e virtues, and rendering
them more and more habitual. Haughtine&s;s or
re&s;entment would be &s;o far from &s;creening you
from the contempt of tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to be|&s;tow
it, that they would only &s;uperadd their hatred.
By receiving it with dignity tempered by mildne&s;s,
you will mo&s;t effectually convert it into re&s;pect<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Secker, Ch. 1, Oxf. Ch. 2, 3. Cant. Stillingfleet, Eccl.
Ca&s;es, vol. i. p. 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Contempt is nece&s;&s;arily di&s;agreeable. However
much you are prepared for bearing it properly
when you meet it, it mu&s;t be natural for you to
wi&s;h to avoid it; and therefore a due &s;en&s;e of the
prevailing contempt of the clergy cannot but excite
you to u&s;e every proper means of avoiding it, or
at lea&s;t of mitigating it as much as po&s;&s;ible. It
will excite you to avoid all &s;uch faults and failings
in your character and behaviour, as are the natural
objects of contempt; for by indulging the&s;e, you
mu&s;t increa&s;e the contempt of the whole order, and
<PB N="59" REF="66">
together with it incur likewi&s;e per&s;onal contempt
drawn upon you ju&s;tly by your&s;elves. It will excite
you to acquire and to endeavour to excel in tho&s;e
qualifications which are acknowleged to be re&s;pect|able:
for the&s;e will procure you a degree of per&s;onal
re&s;pect and honour, which may, in men's behaviour
to you, in a great mea&s;ure, counterbalance their
di&s;po&s;ition to de&s;pi&s;e or revile your profe&s;&s;ion.
From your education, and from the very nature of
your profe&s;&s;ion, a competent degree of knowlege
is ju&s;tly expected: if you have it not, you will &s;oon
be detected by the di&s;cerning, and thought defi|cient
even by the ignorant: gro&s;s ignorance ex|po&s;es
any per&s;on to contempt, and it mu&s;t expo&s;e
you to double contempt, for in you it will
appear highly &s;hameful. Knowlege is univer&s;ally
accounted e&s;timable and ornamental: and u&s;eful
knowlege cannot fail to do you credit in the eyes
of men. A de&s;ire therefore not to &s;tand low in
their opinion, will be a &s;pur to you in acquiring
&s;uch a degree of it as may adorn your profe&s;&s;ion.
The acqui&s;ition of knowlege nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es
application and &s;tudy: a life in a con&s;iderable
degree &s;tudious, befits your character and bu&s;ine&s;s,
and is nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving you from the degra|ding
&s;u&s;picion of mi&s;-&s;pending your time in idle|ne&s;s
or trifles. Imprudence of every kind nece&s;|&s;arily
leads to follies, which mu&s;t &s;ink you in the
e&s;timation of mankind, and render you &s;ometimes
ridiculous, and &s;ometimes de&s;picable: your aver|&s;ion
to the&s;e humiliating &s;ituations cannot fail to
<PB N="60" REF="67">
prompt you to that prudence, circum&s;pection, and
wi&s;dom of behaviour, which will place you out of
the reach of them. Whatever is looked upon as
mean, inevitably provokes contempt. So much
regard has been paid to this, that bodily defects
and remarkable meanne&s;&s;es of appearance have
been deemed &s;ufficient to exclude men from the
prie&s;thood in &s;ome religions: and they certainly
have &s;o great an influence on the &s;entiments of
mankind, that they who have the misfortune to
lie under them, will need, and &s;hould employ, the
greater pains to acquire &s;uch re&s;pectable qualities,
con&s;picuous accompli&s;hments, and &s;hining virtues,
as may overcome that influence, and force man|kind
to forget their exterior defects. But what|ever
betrays a littlene&s;s of mind, narrow and con|tracted
&s;entiments, or low and grovelling views, is
much more ju&s;tly de&s;picable, and will more cer|tainly
and generally be de&s;pi&s;ed. A regard to
reputation &s;hould therefore di&s;po&s;e you to avoid
even vulgarity and ru&s;ticity of manners, and not
to reckon the common rules of good breeding
below your attention; but much more to keep at
a great di&s;tance from all mean practices, &s;elfi&s;h
de&s;igns, and attachment to trivial points of intere&s;t;
and to di&s;play a &s;uperiority even to con&s;iderable
worldly objects, and &s;uch di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s as may
convince men that you prefer doing your duty,
and &s;aving their &s;ouls, to any profit of your own.
Not only &s;uch vices as are reckoned degrading to
the character of every man, will &s;ubject you to
<PB N="61" REF="68">
infallible contempt, but every vice whatever; and
by no means can you &s;o effectually guard again&s;t
the contempt which you mu&s;t naturally wi&s;h to
avoid, as by &s;howing your&s;elves to be free from
every vice, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every virtue. In par|ticular,
that wi&s;h will prove a &s;trong pre&s;ervative
again&s;t all faultine&s;s in your own profe&s;&s;ion; for
negligence in its proper duties is one of the mo&s;t
obvious grounds of contempt, and will &s;oone&s;t
bring it upon you; or if the irreligious and the
wicked &s;hould &s;eem to be the better plea&s;ed with
you, the le&s;s you do in your own bu&s;ine&s;s, yet
even they will inwardly both di&s;approve and de&s;pi&s;e
you, and you mu&s;t lo&s;e the good opinion of all
who have the true&s;t value for your office, and the
warme&s;t love to virtue and religion, and who&s;e
good opinion alone can be really honourable to
you. That wi&s;h will be the &s;tronge&s;t incentive to
con&s;cientious diligence in the peculiar duties of
your profe&s;&s;ion; for &s;uch diligence will force men
to &s;ee that you are u&s;eful, and &s;et you out of the
reach of at lea&s;t many of the reproaches which
they delight in ca&s;ting upon the order<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Ca&s;es, p. 178. Secker, Ch. 1. Oxf.

<P>I have now endeavoured to repre&s;ent, in a
proper light, the importance of the pa&s;toral office
as re&s;ulting from its dignity; and to point out the
&s;entiments and temper with which that importance
<PB N="62" REF="69">
requires that you enter on it, and which will pre|di&s;po&s;e
you to its &s;everal duties. Its importance
ought to produce e&s;teem of it in the people; but
as it is neverthele&s;s very generally treated with
contempt, I have inquired into the cau&s;es of this
contempt, and &s;hewn how you &s;hould be affected
by it, and to what purpo&s;es you &s;hould improve it.
I neither de&s;igned nor pretend to have exhau&s;ted
the &s;ubject, but only to have given &s;uch hints as
may prompt you to think of it, and pur&s;ue it for
your&s;elves. It will be of great advantage that you
think of it often, and &s;eriou&s;ly. It &s;ugge&s;ts many
exerci&s;es on which you may very properly put
your&s;elves. You may con&s;ider what are the means
by which you may be&s;t excite in your&s;elves a due
&s;en&s;e of the excellence of your profe&s;&s;ion. You
may contrive beforehand, how you could, in dif|ferent
&s;uppo&s;ed &s;ituations, act up to it, and &s;up|port
your character with propriety. You may
reflect on the &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions of &s;light or
reproach which you have ob&s;erved or known to
be ca&s;t upon the clergy; and you may examine in
what manner you ought to behave if you met with
them, and by what means you might mo&s;t effec|tually
e&s;cape or confute them. By frequent medi|tation
on &s;uch topics, or even by putting your
thoughts in writing, you will render the proper
&s;entiments familiar to you, and will enter on your
office deeply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with them. Your temper will
be both congenial to your employment, and adapted
to your &s;ituation. For this purpo&s;e all the &s;enti|ments
<PB N="63" REF="70">
which I have mentioned mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed
in conjunction: the expectation of contempt mu&s;t
not &s;uppre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of the dignity of your pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
el&s;e it would either depre&s;s or mi&s;lead you:
it mu&s;t only be united to it, that this &s;en&s;e may not
elate you, and that you may be di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t
contented with the degree of re&s;pect which you
can obtain by the virtues proper to your profe&s;&s;ion,
and not court a &s;purious re&s;pect for qualities foreign
to your character, or perhaps mi&s;becoming it.</P>

<P>THE pa&s;toral office is rendered important, not
only by the dignity of its functions, but al&s;o
by their difficulty. As it is of great moment that
they be performed well, it is likewi&s;e no ea&s;y
matter to perform them well. To be acquainted
with its difficulties, is nece&s;&s;ary for your knowing
how to combat and &s;urmount them; and it will
confirm tho&s;e &s;entiments which ought to be enter|tained

if they be heartily entertained, will have an exten|&s;ive

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Nature of its Difficulties.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the difficulties of the pa&s;toral office are
very great, is evident from the very names by which
the &s;cripture de&s;cribes tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it. It is
remarkable that there is &s;carcely one of the&s;e that
does not imply either &s;kill, or labour, or both; not
even tho&s;e which are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of their
dignity. They are called &startq;rulers,&endq; and &s;aid to
<PB N="65" REF="72">
&startq;have rule&endq; over Chri&s;tians. Every office of
government is attended with no incon&s;iderable
difficulty: but their's is a government of &s;ouls,
the harde&s;t of all arts; it is the government of
men, not in re&s;pect of external behaviour and
overt acts, but likewi&s;e of the habits and di&s;po&s;i|tions
of their hearts; and that too carried on, not
by violent or co&euml;rcive methods, by which tem|poral
rulers may force obedience to the civil laws,
but &s;olely by the gentler methods of per&s;ua&s;ion,
which men, if they be determined on it, may more
ea&s;ily refi&s;t. They are called the &startq;amba&s;&s;adors&endq;
of God, by a metaphorical application of the name
of an employment, very honourable indeed as
implying an important tru&s;t; but which cannot be
executed without great abilities, or without the
faithful and inde&s;atigable application of tho&s;e
abilities to promote the end of the emba&s;&s;y, to
prevent whatever can ob&s;truct it, to contrive every
method of forwarding it, and to maintain the
dignity and the rights of the prince who&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ion
they bear. They are termed &startq;the &s;tewards
&startq;of God;&endq; which implies their being employed in
the difficult ta&s;k of caring for all the members of
that great family of which Chri&s;t is the head, of
di&s;pen&s;ing to them their &s;piritual food, and direct|ing
their practice in their &s;everal provinces. By a
name of the like import, they are called &startq;bi&s;hops,&endq;
over&s;eers, or in&s;pectors; to intimate the obligation
which they are under, to take heed to the conduct
and the &s;piritual intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who are com|mitted
<PB N="66" REF="73">
to their charge. They are called &startq;pa&s;tors,&endq;
or &startq;&s;hepherds;&endq; by the name of an employment
very re&s;pectable in the &s;imple and earlier ages, but
which expo&s;ed tho&s;e who exerci&s;ed it to great toils
and hard&s;hips, &s;ome of which Jacob de&s;cribes from
his own experience, when he &s;ays, &startq;In the day
the drought con&s;umed me, and the fro&s;t by
night, and my &s;leep departed from mine eyes.&endq;
Our Saviour, in de&s;cribing him&s;elf under this cha|racter,
repre&s;ents the occupation as both difficult
and dangerous: &startq;I am the good &s;hepherd: the
good &s;hepherd giveth his life for the &s;heep. But
he that is an hireling, and not the &s;hepherd, &s;eeth
the wolf coming, and leaveth the &s;heep, and
fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and &s;cattereth
the &s;heep. But I am the good &s;hepherd, and
know my &s;heep, and am known of them, and I
lay down my life for the &s;heep.&endq; The epithet
is often in &s;cripture applied to God, and is meant
to intimate his tendere&s;t care of his church, in
re&s;pect of which he repre&s;ents him&s;elf as &startq;feeding
his flock like a &s;hepherd, gathering the lambs
with his arm, and carrying them in his bo&s;om,
and gently leading tho&s;e that are with young.&endq;
Such being the ideas connected with the name in
holy writ, it is plainly given to the mini&s;ters of
religion, on purpo&s;e to intimate the a&s;&s;iduity and
tenderne&s;s of that care which they are required to
take, of tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted to them by Chri&s;t
Je&s;us, &startq;the great &s;hepherd of the &s;heep;&endq; in
feeding or teaching them, in looking after and
<PB N="67" REF="74">
defending them, in guarding them from every &s;in
and error, in applying remedies to all their &s;pi|ritual
di&s;ea&s;es, and in encountering every danger in
di&s;charging the&s;e &s;everal dudes towards them.
The teachers of religion are denominated the
&startq;mini&s;ters or &s;ervants of God;&endq; implying that
they mu&s;t labour in &s;erving him in that work which,
by his authority and under his direction, they are
employed to carry forward in his church. They
are particularly called &startq;labourers&endq; in his hu&s;bandry
and his vineyard; and this de&s;ignation, borrowed
from tho&s;e who earn their bread by their daily labour,
and mud exert them&s;elves diligently and con&s;tantly,
evidently implies, that the teachers of religion mu&s;t
make it their daily employment, their occupation
for life, to promote the in&s;truction and improve|ment
of Chri&s;tians; that their work is hard and
laborious; that it mu&s;t be applied to with dili|gence
and per&s;everance; that it will return upon
them every day; and that it can never be inter|mitted
or given over as long as they live. They
are called &startq;watchmen,&endq; by a metaphor taken
from tho&s;e who were placed on high towers, to
attend day and night, and to be always ready to
give the alarm on every appearance of danger;
and therefore plainly intimating, that mini&s;ters
ought to be alert in ob&s;erving whatever can hurt
the &s;ouls of men, and give them warning of it;
and that for this purpo&s;e ince&s;&s;ant vigilance and
earne&s;t circum&s;pection are, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.
They are called &startq;&s;oldiers,&endq; expre&s;sly to declare
<PB N="68" REF="75">
that their employment calls them to &startq;endure
hardne&s;s,&endq; to encounter difficulties, fatigues,
and dangers. Mini&s;ters are de&s;cribed in &s;cripture
by &s;o many epithets implying various kinds of
exertion, on purpo&s;e to impre&s;s them with a deep
&s;en&s;e that their bu&s;ine&s;s is difficult and laborious,
and demands vigorous application and unwearied
diligence. In like manner, the exertion incum|bent
upon them is de&s;cribed in terms expre&s;&s;ive
of its inten&s;ene&s;s and con&s;tancy. They are ex|horted
to &startq;wait on,&endq; to &startq;&s;tudy,&endq; to &startq;take heed
to,&endq; to &startq;give attendance to,&endq; to &startq;give them|&s;elves

&startq;labour in,&endq; the &s;everal duties of their office.
Injunctions in &s;uch terms would be &s;uperfluous, if
there were not great difficulty in performing the&s;e

of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. iv. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>.&endq; It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a mini&s;ter
to enlighten the under&s;tandings of men with all
religious knowlege, and to bring them to good
practice. It is not enough that he per&s;uade them
to external blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or to ab&s;tinence from
gro&s;s vices; though often this is found to be
difficult enough, and even impracticable. But
his aim mu&s;t be to prevail upon them to for&s;ake
every vice, to extirpate all bad habits; to form
them to inward purity, to unfeigned humility, to
calm re&s;ignation, to the ardent love of God, to
that univer&s;al charity which will make them regard
the intere&s;ts of others as their own; to in&s;pire
them with the love of virtue, to exalt them to the
divine image, to rai&s;e them above the world, to
&s;piritualize their temper to &s;uch a degree, that
they may be fit for a&s;cending to &startq;Mount Zion,
and to the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jeru&s;alem, and to an innumerable company of
holy angels, to the general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t|born,
<PB N="70" REF="77">
and to God all-pure, the judge of all,
and to the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, and
to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous, the mediator of the
new covenant<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24.</NOTE>.&endq; No mini&s;tration of the &s;acred
office can be performed aright, except it be per|formed
with a re&s;pect to the&s;e important ends.
But men mu&s;t, without the greate&s;t care, frequently
lo&s;e &s;ight of them. At one time they will be
ready to go through what they mu&s;t do, without
con&s;idering whether it be or be not well calculated
for an&s;wering the&s;e purpo&s;es. At other times a
regard to their own intere&s;t or reputation will mix
with and &s;ophi&s;ticate their aims. Even when they
keep them mo&s;t directly in their eye, they will
find it very difficult to di&s;cover how every part of
their bu&s;ine&s;s may be performed in the manner
fitte&s;t for promoting them, to force them&s;elves to
perform it in that manner, and to continue and
increa&s;e their labour till they have done all in their
power to accompli&s;h them. Were it incumbent
on a mini&s;ter actually to attain the&s;e ends, his
work would be, not merely difficult, but altogether
impracticable: but it is incumbent on him, both
&s;incerely to aim at them, and to omit nothing
that he can do in order to attain them. To &s;atisfy
him&s;elf of this, he mu&s;t be con&s;cious that he has
uniformly employed his utmo&s;t abilities and in|du&s;try
in the duties of his office. How difficult it
<PB N="71" REF="78">
is to promote the&s;e ends, with any tolerable
&s;ucce&s;s, in a pari&s;h, a man may perceive by only
reflecting how difficult it is to accompli&s;h them in
him&s;elf, or by making trial of forming any one to
whom he has the neare&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;tant acce&s;s,
to &s;uch a temper and behaviour as he would wi&s;h
him to acquire.</P>
<P>The functions of the pa&s;toral office, appointed
for promoting the&s;e ends, are in their very nature
attended with con&s;iderable difficulty. It may be
ea&s;y to go over them, and di&s;patch them in &s;ome
way or other: but it is a very different matter to
execute them con&s;tantly in the mo&s;t u&s;eful and
improving manner. It is not difficult to di&s;cour&s;e
fluently enough on different &s;ubjects of religion, or
to teach people to repeat explications of them by
rote: but it is both difficult and irk&s;ome to &s;ay the
&s;ame things over and over, to &s;et them in one light
after another, to contrive a variety of illu&s;trations,
till the dulle&s;t can really under&s;tand them. With
proper preparation and moderate care, a man may
compo&s;e a very correct di&s;cour&s;e: but it is not &s;o
ea&s;y to preach properly and u&s;efully. To expre&s;s
the truths and duties of religion, &s;o plainly as to be
under&s;tood by the meane&s;t without di&s;gu&s;ting the
mo&s;t knowing; to repre&s;ent what they know
already and hear often, &s;o as to engage their atten|tion
and make an impre&s;&s;ion upon them; to &s;ix
the mea&s;ures of duty, &s;o as neither to alarm the
&s;crupulous, nor give undue licence to the lax; to
<PB N="72" REF="79">
awaken the hardened &s;inner, without di&s;turbing the
timorous with unde&s;erved terrors; to expre&s;s every
&s;entiment in the way fitte&s;t to give a &s;trong con|ception
of divine truth, and to touch the heart;
to admit no &s;entiment but what has a real tendency
to make men wi&s;er and better; to reject every
thought foreign to this purpo&s;e, however fit it
might be for plea&s;ing or gaining applau&s;e; to pre|&s;erve
all the&s;e views, and to be under the influence
of them, all the time a per&s;on is compo&s;ing and
delivering a di&s;cour&s;e; cannot but be arduous:
yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to preaching well. It is &s;till
more difficult to find out the different tempers of
all the variety of per&s;ons with whom a mini&s;ter is
concerned; to di&s;cover the be&s;t ways of applying
to each; to acquire the extent of knowlege requi|&s;ite
for the&s;e different applications; to keep it &s;o
di&s;tinctly in view, as to be able to recollect and
make u&s;e of it as occa&s;ion requires; and after the
nece&s;&s;ary knowlege is obtained, it is &s;till difficult
to learn the addre&s;s which mu&s;t be employed in
applying to men in the &s;everal ways proper for
a clergyman, and to conduct his applications
with that prudence which will render them mo&s;t
effectual.</P>
<P>The work of a mini&s;ter appears, from this repre|&s;entation
of it, to be abundantly difficult, though
all things &s;hould con&s;pire in the mo&s;t friendly
manner with his endeavours to promote and exe|cute
it. But the difficulty is immen&s;ely increa&s;ed
<PB N="73" REF="80">
by the great and numerous ob&s;tructions which are
oppo&s;ed to his endeavours. They ari&s;e both from
him&s;elf, and from the people. Many ob&s;tructions
mu&s;t ari&s;e from the unavoidable infirmities and
imperfections of a man's own nature. It is not
ea&s;y to throw off the indi&s;po&s;ition, which indolence
will at times produce, to his employing all the
time and pains nece&s;&s;ary for the right di&s;charge of
all his duties; to overcome the fal&s;e tenderne&s;s
which makes it painful to declare di&s;agreeable
truths; or the reluctance which mode&s;ty mu&s;t
feel again&s;t reproving one's &s;eniors or &s;uperiors
with becoming freedom; to attain the re&s;olution
which will enable him to incur whatever incon|veniences
may ari&s;e from his admoni&s;hing tho&s;e on
whom his intere&s;t depends; or to encounter the
ridicule, contempt, and obloquy, to which he will
be expo&s;ed by fairly condemning prevailing errors,
fa&s;hionable evils, and polite or popular vices. Ob|&s;tructions
at lea&s;t equal to the&s;e ari&s;e from the
&s;tupidity, the prejudices, and the vices of other
men. In order to perform the bu&s;ine&s;s of his
calling, a mini&s;ter mu&s;t infu&s;e knowlege into
tho&s;e who are &s;o dull as to be &s;carcely capable of
di&s;tinct thought. He mu&s;t teach tho&s;e who have
very little lei&s;ure, and very little inclination, per|haps
even an aver&s;ion, to learn. He mu&s;t di&s;cover
the inward vices and depravities of tho&s;e who do
all they can to conceal them from him. He mu&s;t
treat with &s;kill the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;oul, which are
more latent and &s;tubborn than many of tho&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="81">
bodily di&s;tempers which phy&s;icians find it very
hard to cure. He mu&s;t make men willing to cor|rect
faults which they fondly hug; and to con|quer
habits which they have &s;trengthened by thou|&s;ands
of acts repeated almo&s;t every day. He mu&s;t
give them in an hour good impre&s;&s;ions, which may
have &s;trength enough to continue and influence
them for many days, in oppo&s;ition to all the objects
which tend mo&s;t &s;trongly to obliterate them. He
mu&s;t bring them to a temper and conduct directly
oppo&s;ite to that which is powerfully recommended
to them by the example of the generality of tho&s;e
with whom they conver&s;e. He mu&s;t per&s;uade
them to that from which all their corrupt pa&s;&s;ions
draw them off. He mu&s;t per&s;uade the ambitious
to &s;light power and honours, and to a&s;pire only to
the heavenly kingdom; the covetous, to value no
riches in compari&s;on with the invi&s;ible trea&s;ures
which are above; the &s;en&s;uali&s;t, to &s;acrifice the
plea&s;ures for which he has always had a reli&s;h, for
the &s;ake of more refined plea&s;ures, which he is
incapable of ta&s;ting till he be purified from the love
of external gratifications. He mu&s;t bring faith
and hope to prevail over &s;en&s;e; and withdraw all
the affections of human nature from tho&s;e objects
which &s;olicit them mo&s;t directly, and gratify them
mo&s;t immediately, to objects remote or future. He
mu&s;t &startq;wre&s;tle, not again&s;t fle&s;h and blood only,
but again&s;t principalities, again&s;t powers, again&s;t
the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world, again&s;t
&s;piritual wickedne&s;s in high places:&endq; and in
<PB N="75" REF="82">
order to be &s;ucce&s;sful in his occupation, he mu&s;t
wre&s;tle &s;o as to baffle all their power, and di&s;|appoint
all their artifices. It is only &s;o far as a
mini&s;ter &s;urmounts the&s;e ob&s;tacles, and, notwith|&s;tanding
them, accompli&s;hes the reformation and
improvement of mankind, that he attains the end
and de&s;ign of his vocation. Not actually to do &s;o
in any in&s;tance, would be to be ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s in
his &s;tation: and &s;o far as he fails by negligence in
any part of his duty, he is an&s;werable for the
failure. But in order to effect all this in a few
in&s;tances, in order to perform what is proper for
effecting it, in &s;uch a degree as not to be really
blameable for negligence, very great pains and
labour mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be be&s;towed.</P>
<P>I would not willingly exaggerate the difficulties
of the pa&s;toral office: exaggeration could only
produce de&s;pondence, and, by repre&s;enting them as
in&s;urmountable, might repre&s;s every endeavour to
&s;urmount them, and occa&s;ion an entire neglect of
every duty. But it is equally dangerous to exte|nuate
them; it would be to deceive you; and by
thinking that you have little to do, you would be
tempted to do almo&s;t nothing, and incur all the
ill con&s;equences of incapacity or idlene&s;s. The
difficulties which I have de&s;cribed are all real; they
are either expre&s;sly pointed out in &s;cripture, or
they grow out of the very nature of the functions
and de&s;ign of the pa&s;toral office: and therefore
you ought not to di&s;&s;emble them from your&s;elves.
<PB N="76" REF="83">
If they require a great degree of exertion, and
&s;ugge&s;t a high &s;tandard of duty, by having it
in your eye you will at lea&s;t approach nearer to it,
than otherwi&s;e you would have even thought of
attempting. In what manner the view of them
ought to affect and influence you, and what
obligations you lie under to do your utmo&s;t that
you may &s;urmount them, I &s;hall next explain.</P>

<P>IT is not perhaps altogether uncommon for men
to choo&s;e the profe&s;&s;ion of a clergyman as one of
the ea&s;ie&s;t ways of gaining their bread. This
view is not more fordid than it is erroneous. If
this profe&s;&s;ion exempt men from the labours of the
body, it &s;ubjects them to great labours of the
mind: if it impo&s;e not the drudgeries which
require only mu&s;cular &s;trength or animal agility, it
requires exertions which will at lea&s;t as much
fatigue and exhau&s;t even the body. Its difficulties
are evidently &s;uch, as ought to deter every man
from undertaking it, who is not determined to
devote him&s;elf to its duties, to make it really his
bu&s;ine&s;s to labour in it with a&s;&s;iduity. To think or
to &s;ay, &startq;Put me into one of the prie&s;ts' offices,
that I may eat a piece of bread,&endq; betrays a total
<PB N="77" REF="84">
ignorance and in&s;en&s;ibility of the arduous nature of
the&s;e offices.</P>
<P>If you imagine that the occupation which you
have cho&s;en is attended with little difficulty, the
certain con&s;equence is, that you will be at little
pains to qualify your&s;elves for it; for you will
think a little pains &s;ufficient. But by being previ|ou&s;ly
well aware of its &s;everal difficulties, by often
thinking of them, by cultivating an habitual &s;en&s;e
of them, you will never want a &s;pur to diligence
in your preparation for them. You will think no
preparation too much; you will be di&s;po&s;ed to
exceed if po&s;&s;ible, rather than run the ri&s;k of
falling &s;hort of what is nece&s;&s;ary. You will never
reckon your&s;elves perfectly prepared, but will con|tinue
through your whole lives to become fitter for
&s;truggling again&s;t them. A difficult work requires
both &s;kill and diligence, in order to its being well
executed: the foundations of both mu&s;t be laid in
your preparation for entering on the pa&s;toral office.
It is not enough that you acquire all the knowlege,
a right application of which would contribute to
your right di&s;charge of its functions: it is proper
likewi&s;e that you learn in &s;ome mea&s;ure to apply it
to that purpo&s;e. You may in various ways have
opportunities of performing functions in &s;ome
degree &s;imilar to this office; to pupils, for in&s;tance,
and younger friends; and the inuring of your&s;elves
to the&s;e, and &s;tudying to perform them in the mo&s;t
u&s;eful manner, will train you for the right execu|tion
<PB N="78" REF="85">
of like functions in a more exten&s;ive &s;phere.
You may likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e to your&s;elves particular
&s;ituations of difficulty, which may po&s;&s;ibly hereafter
occur to you in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a mini&s;ter; or you may
ob&s;erve or get information of &s;uch as have occurred
to others: and you may con&s;ider deliberately how
you could mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully exert your&s;elves in that
&s;ituation; and what you determine concerning it at
one time, you may examine at another time, and
alter, correct, or improve it as you find rea&s;on.
It will likewi&s;e be extremely u&s;eful, if you have
opportunity, to accompany &s;ome mini&s;ter who
performs them well, in the &s;everal duties of his
pari&s;h, to ob&s;erve his manner, and even to attempt
the performance of them in his pre&s;ence, and by
his direction, and to receive and profit by his
remarks on your performance. I &s;aid that the
foundations of diligence, as well as of &s;kill, mu&s;t
be laid during your preparation for the pa&s;toral
office: they can be laid only by your accu&s;toming
your&s;elves to diligence in whatever you are em|ployed,
whether your private &s;tudies, any branch
of teaching, or any other bu&s;ine&s;s; and particu|larly
by accu&s;toming your&s;elves readily to obey
every call to good offices or active exertion, with|out
&s;uffering indolence, reclu&s;ene&s;s, or the love of
&s;tudy, to withhold you from them.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of the difficulties of the pa&s;toral office
will be a &s;trong incentive to diligence, not only in
preparing your&s;elves for it, but al&s;o in performing
its duties when you &s;hall be called to it. Under a
<PB N="79" REF="86">
lively &s;en&s;e of the arduous nature of his work, a
mini&s;ter will &s;tudy, by all the methods of in&s;truc|tion,
exhortation, admonition, reproof, terror,
con&s;olation, per&s;ua&s;ion, in public and in private, in
their health and their &s;ickne&s;s, amid&s;t the di&s;&s;ipation
of pro&s;perity and the depre&s;&s;ion of adver&s;ity, to
enlighten the ignorant with religious knowlege,
to form the young to impre&s;&s;ions of truth and
goodne&s;s, to fix the unthinking, to awaken the
&s;ecure, to reclaim the wicked, to re&s;olve the
doubting, to confirm the wavering, to &s;trengthen
the weak, to perfect the &s;aints. To this he will
devote his time, his &s;trength, and all his talents.
He con&s;iders it as what properly belongs to him;
and though he cannot be every hour employed in
it, yet all other pur&s;uits, even &s;uch as would mo&s;t
laudably gratify his curio&s;ity or his ta&s;te, and &s;uch
as are mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for his temporal
concerns, he will reckon only avocations in com|pari&s;on,
&s;ubordinate to this, and cheerfully po&s;tpone,
when he has an urgent call to any part of this.</P>
<P>Under a &s;erious view of the difficulties of the
pa&s;toral care, the &s;ouls of men would &s;ink, if they
were not con&s;cious that it is the work of God, and
that God him&s;elf is engaged in it. This reflection
&s;upports them under all their exertions, by the
hope of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by the a&s;&s;urance, that if
they be not blameably deficient, he will render
their exertions &s;ucce&s;sful, as far as the views and
plan of his providence permit. It will likewi&s;e
make every recollection of difficulty in their work,
<PB N="80" REF="87">
an irre&s;i&s;tible motive to earne&s;t prayer for his aid, both
in qualifying them for it, and in performing it, and
for &s;ucce&s;s in all their mini&s;trations. A &s;pirit of
devotion is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in all of your pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
and will be the natural con&s;equence of a
ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its difficulty, together with a due con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of your own weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to enlarge on the&s;e topics. The
&s;entiments and di&s;po&s;itions which I have mentioned
flow nece&s;&s;arily from a view of the nature of the
pa&s;toral office, and are by it rendered indi&s;pen&s;ably
obligatory. But a new and &s;trong obligation to
them ari&s;es from con&s;idering farther, that a failure
in the&s;e, and the improper or imperfect execution
of that office, which will be occa&s;ioned by it, are
highly criminal, are productive of the mo&s;t perni|cious
con&s;equences, and will render &s;uch as are
chargeable with them obnoxious to the &s;evere&s;t
puni&s;hment. There are two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es of
duties incumbent on all per&s;ons who occupy a
public &s;tation; the one, of tho&s;e duties which
belong to them in common with others, as men
and Chri&s;tians; the other, of &s;uch as are peculiar
to that public &s;tation in which they are placed.
The latter are no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than the former to
complete goodne&s;s of character; and the neglect
of them is no le&s;s blameable, no le&s;s hurtful to
&s;ociety, no le&s;s &s;everely puni&s;hable. It is not
enough that a judge be blamele&s;s in his private life;
it is equally nece&s;&s;ary that he execute ju&s;tice in his
<PB N="81" REF="88">
public capacity, and promote the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety
by his authority and influence; and if he gro&s;sly
neglect the opportunities of doing &s;o, or wilfully
pervert ju&s;tice, he is as highly blameable as if he
had been guilty of &s;imilar omi&s;&s;ions or injuries in
private life, as much hurts &s;ociety, and can as
little expect to e&s;cape puni&s;hment from God. In
like manner, though a mini&s;ter &s;hould be unblame|able
and virtuous in common life, though he
&s;hould be chargeable with nothing that would have
been faulty if he had been only a private Chri&s;tian;
yet if he have no activity in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his office,
no zeal for attaining its end; if he &s;pend that
time in indolence, in amu&s;ement, in worldly bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
or even in learned &s;tudy, which ought to
have been employed in preparing him for in&s;truct|ing
his people to more advantage, or in doing good
offices among them; he is highly faulty and vicious.
In his &s;tation he cannot be a good man, without
being a good mini&s;ter. The criminal omi&s;&s;ion or
the carele&s;s performance of the duties of his public
&s;tation, will be at lea&s;t as hurtful to the great intere&s;ts
of men, as po&s;itive acts of vice in his private life.
If by his negligence he &s;uffer men to lo&s;e the
impre&s;&s;ions of religion, or if by his un&s;kilful and
improper methods of in&s;tructing them, he &s;ow the
&s;eeds of folly, bigotry, &s;uper&s;tition, or enthu&s;ia&s;m,
the ill effects may continue through many genera|tions.
He cannot be free from the blood of the&s;e
generations, nor innocent from the&s;e mi&s;chiefs,
who&s;e incapacity or negligence gave occa&s;ion to
<PB N="82" REF="89">
them. So far as the&s;e were criminal, they mu&s;t
expo&s;e him to &s;evere puni&s;hment under the govern|ment
of a righteous God<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Leechman, Syn. Serm.</NOTE>. Negligence in the
pa&s;toral office reflects more di&s;honour upon God,
than negligence in any other profe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e
this profe&s;&s;ion, more immediately than any other,
regards God and religion. It is likewi&s;e produc|tive
of wor&s;e con&s;equences: the improper exerci&s;e
of other profe&s;&s;ions may produce particular incon|veniences,
or promote &s;ome vices; but the im|proper
exerci&s;e of this tends directly to promote all
vice, to ob&s;truct all goodne&s;s, to bring religion into
di&s;credit, and to ruin, not the greate&s;t temporal
intere&s;ts of mankind, but their eternal &s;alvation.
Self-love, benevolence, con&s;cience, every principle
of human nature that can have any influence on
conduct, mu&s;t urge a clergyman, with their
greate&s;t force, to avoid all negligence and impro|priety
in the functions of his office. A crime
attended with &s;o mi&s;chievous con&s;equences, and
committed in oppo&s;ition to &s;o &s;trong obligations,
mu&s;t imply heinous guilt, and infer a dreadful
puni&s;hment. The &s;cripture warns us of its de|merit
and its puni&s;hment. God declares to Eze|kiel,
that if he neglected to warn the wicked &startq;man
from his way,&endq; when God commanded him to
give warning, &startq;the &s;ame wicked man &s;hould die in
&startq;his iniquity, but his blood would God require at
<PB N="83" REF="90">

immediate commi&s;&s;ion from God to reprove parti|cular
per&s;ons, for their &s;ins, in his name; but
certainly implies, that teachers who have a general
commi&s;&s;ion to warn men of all &s;in, are really
chargeable with their guilt, if they neglect to warn
them when they are bound to warn them. For
this is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd, which is profe&s;&s;edly
directed to the ordinary religious in&s;tructors of the
I&s;raelites<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Ca&s;es, vol. i. p. 109, &amp;c. Burnet, Pa&s;t. Care, c. 2.</NOTE>. In the New Te&s;tament it is threatened,
that the unfaithful and unwi&s;e &s;teward, who

&s;everal parts of their duty; and it is plainly inti|mated,
that in order to their being &startq;pure from
the blood of all men,&endq; they mu&s;t be able to
&startq;take them to record, that they cea&s;ed not to
warn every man, that they kept back nothing
<PB N="84" REF="91">
that was profitable unto them, but have &s;howed
them, and taught them publicly, and from hou&s;e

unto them all the coun&s;el of God<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 19, 26, 27, 31.</NOTE>,&endq; and that
they have declared it in the be&s;t manner that their
utmo&s;t care could enable them to do it<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Pa&s;t. Care, c. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the other hand, to execute an office of &s;o
great importance with fidelity and diligence, to
promote the improvement and perfection of the
noble&s;t creature in this lower world, to endeavour
to &s;ave the &s;ouls of men by giving them le&s;&s;ons of
knowlege and virtue, to co-operate with God in
&s;preading happine&s;s; is prai&s;e-worthy and glorious,
and will be crowned with a reward proportioned
to the dignity and difficulty of the work. They
who labour carefully in it &startq;&s;hall at lea&s;t deliver
their own &s;ouls, though the wicked to whom
they give warning, turn not from his wicked|ne&s;s,
but die in his iniquity<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ezek. iii. 19. xxxiii. 9.</NOTE>.&endq; They &s;hall,
we are a&s;&s;ured, &startq;&s;ave their own &s;ouls<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE>;&endq; and
&startq;when the chief &s;hepherd &s;hall appear, they &s;hall
receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 4.</NOTE>.&endq;
Probably too, they &s;hall &s;ave many of tho&s;e that
&startq;hear them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE>,&endq; and &s;hall thence, both by the
joyful reflections of their own minds, and by the
remuneration of the God whom they &s;erved,
<PB N="85" REF="92">
derive a very great acce&s;&s;ion to their happine&s;s: for
&startq;they that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall &s;hine

&s;tars for ever and ever<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dan. xii. 3. Leechman, Syn. Serm.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus all that application, diligence, and care,
which the difficulty of the pa&s;toral office requires,
and therefore renders incumbent on tho&s;e who
occupy it, is farther enforced upon them by the
mo&s;t intere&s;ting motives, by alarming apprehen|&s;ions
of dreadful puni&s;hment in ca&s;e of failure, and
encouraging pro&s;pects of a great reward in ca&s;e of
&s;incere and faithful exertion. A con&s;tant re&s;pect
to the&s;e mu&s;t be maintained; and if it be, will pre|vent
their ever &s;inking under the labours of their
calling. It &s;hould likewi&s;e be &s;teadily maintained
by you, through the whole cour&s;e of your prepa|ration
for that calling; for I doubt not that every
faulty negligence in your preparation expo&s;es you
to &s;ome degree of the &s;ame danger, and that every
con&s;cientious exertion in your preparation will
entitle you to &s;ome degree of the &s;ame reward;

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the true Spirit of the Pa&s;toral Office.</HEAD>
<P>WE have con&s;idered &s;eparately, the dignity and
the difficulty of the pa&s;toral office, and pointed out
the &s;entiments which ari&s;e from, and are &s;uitable to
each. But it is nece&s;&s;ary that we accu&s;tom our|&s;elves
always to view them in conjunction. If we
look for no difficulty, the meeting with the &s;malle&s;t
will di&s;concert and di&s;hearten us: and we will not
be at much pains to conquer great difficulties, if we
do not think it of &s;ome importance to conquer
them. By being viewed in conjunction, they will
&s;ugge&s;t and impre&s;s upon us &s;ome &s;entiments of very
great moment, additional to tho&s;e which we have
hitherto mentioned. All that I mean by this may
be expre&s;&s;ed in this &s;ingle article, that they will
infu&s;e into us the genuine &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion.
This &s;pirit is the immediate re&s;ult of a high &s;en&s;e of
the importance of the pa&s;toral office in its full
extent, as including both excellence and difficulty;
rather, perhaps, it is that &s;en&s;e rai&s;ed to perfection,
and exerting it&s;elf with vigour in all its proper
energies.</P>
<P>Every profe&s;&s;ion has its proper &s;pirit. All emi|nent
arti&s;ts have been fired with the &s;pirit of their
art, and could not have become eminent with|out
it. You too mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, deeply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="87" REF="94">
with the &s;pirit of your profe&s;&s;ion; otherwi&s;e you
can never be eminent in it, nor even execute its
functions tolerably. The &s;pirit of any profe&s;&s;ion is,
an eager and inextingui&s;hable de&s;ire to &s;ucceed in
it, and a certain ardour of &s;oul, a boldne&s;s and
enthu&s;ia&s;m in the exerci&s;es of it. The &s;pirit of
your profe&s;&s;ion is, a love to its duties, a zeal to
perform them in the be&s;t manner, a warm ambition
to accompli&s;h its end: it is the active operation of
love to God, to Chri&s;t, to the &s;ouls of men, to
truth, to goodne&s;s, to religion, rai&s;ed to an exalted
pitch, and directed to the one point of animating
you, fir&s;t in qualifying your&s;elves for the &s;acred
office, and next in devoting your&s;elves to the per|formance
of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s belonging to it.</P>
<P>Nothing of the lea&s;t con&s;ideration can be exe|cuted
well by a per&s;on who does not enter into the
&s;pirit of it. If you be de&s;titute of the &s;pirit of
your profe&s;&s;ion, you will be languid in every thing
relating to it. While you exert your&s;elves as often
as you are engaged in a favourite &s;tudy, in amu&s;e|ment,
or in bu&s;ine&s;s, all exertion will for&s;ake you
as &s;oon as you turn to your proper occupations.
It will be a force upon you to turn to them. You
will be anxious to run over them as &s;oon and as
ea&s;ily as po&s;&s;ible. You will content your&s;elves
with executing them in the mo&s;t &s;uperficial manner:
and even this will be an unplea&s;ant drudgery. You
will be glad when you have got through it: but ere
long it mu&s;t return again; and this thought will
<PB N="88" REF="95">
damp your joy. The perpetual recurrence of em|ployments
for which you have no reli&s;h, and which
are for that rea&s;on irk&s;ome, will eat out the com|fort
of your lives. You will live out of your ele|ment,
and therefore with con&s;tant di&s;&s;atisfaction
and unea&s;ine&s;s to your&s;elves. Whenever you mu&s;t
do what belongs to your profe&s;&s;ion, it will be with
reluctance, and with regret, for being obliged to
interrupt &s;omething that is more agreeable to you.
With all the pain which it gives you, it will be but
ill done. You will exert your&s;elves feebly, where
the greate&s;t vigour is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and be
cold and unconcerned, where you &s;hould be fired
with ardour and zeal.</P>
<P>On the contrary, your being animated with the
&s;pirit of your profe&s;&s;ion will make you enter with
alacrity into whatever belongs to it. It is he only
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;pirit of his art, that will ever
attempt any thing great and excellent in it; and
to &s;uch attempts he will never want a powerful
impul&s;e. If you have the true &s;pirit of your art,
all the difficulties which lie in the way of your
becoming fit to exerci&s;e it, and of your exerci&s;ing
it with &s;ucce&s;s, will be &s;o far from di&s;couraging or
dejecting you, that they will embolden and elevate
you. It is a remarkable property of human
nature, that, when a man is heartily engaged in a
de&s;ign, and re&s;olved and fit to pro&s;ecute it, any
difficulty or oppo&s;ition in the pro&s;ecution, in&s;tead
of &s;inking him into de&s;pondence, rai&s;es his ambition,
<PB N="89" REF="96">
excites his courage, draws forth his &s;trength, and
adds force to all his motions: and the greater the
difficulty is, provided it appear not to be ab&s;olutely
in&s;urmountable, the more it invigorates and in|&s;pirits
the &s;oul; the bolder and more eager it renders
a per&s;on to encounter it, and the more &s;trenuou&s;ly
he will exert him&s;elf in order to &s;urmount it. As
the virtue of the load&s;tone would have remained
unknown, if iron had never been applied to it, &s;o
the powers of the human mind could never have
fully &s;hewn them&s;elves, if circum&s;tances had not
occurred which required the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of
them. Abilities which have accompli&s;hed wonders,
would have lain for ever latent, but for opportu|nities
which called them forth, but for difficulties
which a more languid exertion of them could not
have &s;urmounted. An aptitude and pronene&s;s to
be in this manner invigorated and exalted by the
peculiar difficulties and labours of any profe&s;&s;ion,
is always an e&s;&s;ential part of the true &s;pirit of that
profe&s;&s;ion. The true &s;pirit of your profe&s;&s;ion can|not
fail to produce it in the highe&s;t degree. To
encounter formidable difficulties for a trifling end,
would be a romantic folly: but to find difficulty
in the pur&s;uit of an end which we ju&s;tly reckon
glorious, and on which our heart is intent, will
only animate us to uncommon activity. To find
our&s;elves engaged in an enterpri&s;e worthy of our
utmo&s;t exertion, and which indi&s;pen&s;ably requires
it, cannot but give a greatne&s;s to the &s;oul, rai&s;e it
to an heroic elevation, and enable us to act with a
<PB N="90" REF="97">
degree of force and vigour of which we &s;hould never
have &s;u&s;pected our&s;elves capable, if we had not been
thus rou&s;ed to employ it. If your temper be har|moni&s;ed
with your profe&s;&s;ion, if your heart be
wholly engaged in it, the &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s of
your work will kindle your zeal to do it into a
flame; I might almo&s;t &s;ay, will quicken it into a
living principle, pervading all your mini&s;trations,
rendering you indefatigable in them, and leading
you to perform them well.</P>
<P>By being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the true &s;pirit of your pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
you will not only be rendered diligent in
whatever belongs to it, but you will likewi&s;e take
plea&s;ure in it. It is in exertion and activity that
men find their highe&s;t enjoyment, There is not a
more unhappy or irk&s;ome &s;tate, than to have
nothing to do. Even difficulty is nece&s;&s;ary to our
enjoyment. When every thing goes on with per|fect
ea&s;e, when we meet with nothing that requires
the exertion of our powers, the mind is not &s;uffi|ciently
engaged or employed, it &s;inks into an
unea&s;y &s;tate of languor; it needs &s;omething to
awaken it, before it can enjoy it&s;elf or any thing
el&s;e. Its life and its enjoyment grow with the
ob&s;tructions which it is called upon to combat. In
con&s;equence of this &s;tructure of our nature, when
men are engaged in a profe&s;&s;ion altogether &s;uitable
to their genius and inclination, the more con&s;tantly
they are employed in it, the happier they are.
The mechanic has his chief &s;atisfaction in working
<PB N="91" REF="98">
in his calling however laborious, and could not live
without it; and if he have any ingenuity, a work of
&s;ome difficulty, out of the ordinary round of his
operations, rai&s;es him to a &s;tate of higher &s;atis|faction.
The merchant finds his plea&s;ure in a run
of bu&s;ine&s;s, and could not bear to be idle. The
man who is turned for &s;tudy, wi&s;hes to be em|ployed
in it, delights in &s;uch re&s;earches as require
thought and reflection, regrets the interruptions
which he meets with, and &s;uffers unea&s;ine&s;s in them.
In a word, every man who loves his occupation,
willingly and cheerfully labours in it, from morning
to evening, day after day. If you therefore &s;uffi|ciently
love your profe&s;&s;ion, and bring your&s;elves
to the temper which &s;uits it, you will find your
natural &s;atisfaction in being wholly taken up with
what belongs to it, as your real and proper bu&s;ine&s;s.
The greate&s;t exertion in its duties will be your
delight. Far from appearing weary of them when
you are performing them, and longing till they be
over, you will joy in them even when you are
mo&s;t fatigued. You will prefer them to every
other manner of employing your&s;elves. A long
intermi&s;&s;ion of them would give you pain. When
you are called off by them, from amu&s;ements the
mo&s;t agreeable, or from &s;tudies the mo&s;t favourite,
you will cheerfully embrace the call as giving you
an opportunity of applying your&s;elves to offices
&s;till dearer to you. Its greate&s;t toils, by drawing
out your hearty efforts to &s;u&s;tain them, will render
your &s;atisfaction more &s;ublime.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="99">
If the genuine &s;pirit of the pa&s;toral office be not
fully conceived by the de&s;cription which I have
given of it, you will perhaps complete your idea by
attending to the accounts which the apo&s;tle Paul, in
various parts of his writings, gives of his own
exertions, in all which he was actuated by a large
portion of that &s;pirit. Exalted and impelled by it,
he &startq;hungered, and thir&s;ted, and was naked,
and was buffeted, and laboured, working with
his own hands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 11, 12.</NOTE>: &s;uffering all things, le&s;t he

<P><PB N="93" REF="100">
The &s;pirit of your profe&s;&s;ion is a &s;ublime, a
cele&s;tial &s;pirit. It is of great importance to your|&s;elves,
that you be deeply tinctured with it; even
in re&s;pect of the comfort and joy of your pre&s;ent
life, it is of very great importance to you. If
any be con&s;cious of no &s;park of this &s;pirit within
him&s;elf, and be not re&s;olved to cheri&s;h it, he
ought by all means to relinqui&s;h every thought of
undertaking an office in which, without it, he can
be neither u&s;eful nor happy. A mini&s;ter of reli|gion,
who di&s;likes the bu&s;ine&s;s of his calling, who
has not even an ardent love to it, mu&s;t lead a very
unplea&s;ant life. He &s;aunters away life in li&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s;
he turns to his proper functions with reluc|tance;
he toils through them with di&s;ta&s;te; he
performs them ill; and is di&s;&s;atisfied with him|&s;elf;
and from this di&s;&s;atisfaction, again performs
them wor&s;e, and is more unea&s;y in his own
feelings and reflections. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
performing functions &s;o very important, in a
wrong or negligent manner, cannot but be galling.
Nothing le&s;s than the mo&s;t &s;tupid thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s,
or the mo&s;t impenetrable obduracy, can prevent
its exciting the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;entiments and the
mo&s;t alarming apprehen&s;ions. But if you have
the noble &s;pirit of your profe&s;&s;ion, you will take
it for granted from the very beginning, that the
duties of your office will give you con&s;tant employ|ment;
you will dedicate your&s;elves wholly to

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Duties of the Pa&s;toral Office.</HEAD>
<P>A JUST e&s;timate of the dignity and difficulty of
the pa&s;toral office, accompanied by the &s;enti|ments
and temper naturally re&s;ulting from it, can|not
fail to produce, in all who have made choice of
it, a &s;olicitude to inquire, what are the particular
duties belonging to that office, by means of which
its difficulties may be combated, and its momentous
end attained. The explication of the&s;e duties
will both confirm the general idea which I have
exhibited of its importance, and di&s;cover what its
importance requires from tho&s;e who occupy it.</P>
<P>In general, it is the duty of a mini&s;ter to pro|mote
the &s;alvation of Chri&s;tians, by in&s;tructing
them in the principles and precepts of Chri&s;tianity,
and leading them to the faith and obedience of
them. Whatever is conducive to this purpo&s;e,
belongs to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a mini&s;ter: and it is
plainly a purpo&s;e which there cannot be the
&s;lighte&s;t probability of an&s;wering without diligently
u&s;ing a variety of means. A mini&s;ter bears an
immediate relation to the pari&s;h in which he is
fixed; to it his labours &s;hould be particularly and
<PB N="96" REF="103">
principally devoted; and in this capacity many
duties of different kinds are incumbent on him.
He likewi&s;e bears a relation to the church in gene|ral;
and from it ari&s;e other duties, in &s;ome degree
different from tho&s;e which are parochial. To a&s;&s;i&s;t
you in under&s;tanding the pa&s;toral duties, I &s;hall
con&s;ider them under four heads, to which they may
be all reduced:&mdash;private duties, re&s;pecting indi|viduals;&mdash;private
duties, re&s;pecting le&s;&s;er &s;ocie|ties;&mdash;public
duties, re&s;pecting a whole pari&s;h;
&mdash;and eccle&s;ia&s;tical duties, re&s;pecting the church
in general.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="97" REF="104">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Private Duties re&s;pecting Individuals.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems to be an opinion too prevalent, that the
only e&s;&s;ential duty of a mini&s;ter is preaching and
di&s;pen&s;ing the &s;acraments, and that after perform|ing
the&s;e, and an&s;wering a few occa&s;ional calls in
his pari&s;h, he needs do nothing more. It is not
reckoned nece&s;&s;ary for him to conver&s;e with all his
pari&s;hioners, or to conver&s;e with them in another
manner than any other per&s;on would do. The
method of education for the mini&s;try, it mu&s;t be
acknowleged, has &s;ome tendency to lead men into
this mi&s;take; for it is directed to their preparation
for &s;carcely any other part of the pa&s;toral func|tions.
To fit them for the more private labours
in a pari&s;h, no means are ordinarily u&s;ed. Yet a
very little reflection will convince you, that there
are many private duties e&s;&s;ential to the pa&s;toral
office. Merely to appear in public at certain
&s;tated times, to deliver a &s;et di&s;cour&s;e, to put up
prayers, and to pre&s;ide in the ritual parts of reli|gion,
cannot po&s;&s;ibly either be adequate to the
difficulties of that office, and the importance of its
end, or come up to the lowe&s;t &s;en&s;e of many of
the expre&s;&s;ions which the &s;cripture u&s;es in de&s;cri|bing
it. He who does no more than this, cannot

be &s;aid to &startq;take heed to the flock over which he is
over&s;eer<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 28.</NOTE>,&endq; &s;carcely at all to &startq;take the over|&s;ight

all things<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 5.</NOTE>,&endq; attentive in ob&s;erving every thing
that can ob&s;truct the improvement and &s;alvation of
his people, and in readine&s;s to remove it before its

&s;eem to be le&s;s promi&s;ing. Yet all the&s;e are terms
employed by the in&s;pired writers in de&s;cribing the
office and duties of a pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>His public duties are doubtle&s;s of very great
importance and utility: but his private duties are
of no le&s;s, perhaps of greater. Many of the
people are &s;o ignorant, and have &s;o little lei&s;ure
and &s;o few advantages for acquiring knowlege, that
it is almo&s;t only by private and occa&s;ional conver|&s;ation
with them, or in&s;tructions to them, that they
can be prepared for under&s;tanding &s;ermons, or
deriving benefit from them: and it is by the &s;ame
means that they can be directed to make a parti|cular
<PB N="99" REF="106">
improvement of the general in&s;tructions
which are given in public. Nothing, therefore,
can contribute more to the &s;ucce&s;s of your public
mini&s;trations, than private addre&s;&s;es, prudently
and familiarly pointed to the &s;ame end. It is ob|vious
that the teachers of &s;ome &s;ects acquire and
maintain a &s;urpri&s;ing influence over their adherents,
by a frequent religious intercour&s;e with them in
private. It is perhaps the greater on account of
the &s;uper&s;tition or the enthu&s;ia&s;m which is blended
with their intercour&s;e. But certainly a rational
and &s;ober religious intercour&s;e, cultivated, with
equal a&s;&s;iduity, by a mini&s;ter with his people,
would give him an influence with them, if not &s;o
ab&s;olute, yet very con&s;iderable, and much more
u&s;eful. The better he is known to them, the
greater influence he will have upon them; and the
more perfectly he knows them, the more he will
be qualified for employing it to good purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The private duties of the pa&s;toral office are like|wi&s;e
more difficult than the public. In order to
render them effectual, he mu&s;t be able to di&s;cern
the different capacities and tempers of the per&s;ons
with whom he conver&s;es, to di&s;tingui&s;h the mo&s;t
&s;ucce&s;sful manner of applying to each; and mu&s;t
acquire a readine&s;s in adapting him&s;elf to parti|cular
emergencies, which occur &s;uddenly, and
which give little time for recollection, and none for
preparation. In preaching, great a&s;&s;i&s;tance may
be had both from the rules of compo&s;ition, and
<PB N="100" REF="107">
from models of &s;ermons: but in his private duties,
a mini&s;ter can have much le&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He is
almo&s;t entirely left to learn the proper manner of
performing them, from his own reflection and
prudence; and to correct the mi&s;takes into which
he has fallen at fir&s;t, by &s;low degrees, from his
own growing experience<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Pa&s;t. Care, c. 8. Secker, Charge 1. Oxf. Charge 2,

<P>The private duties of the pa&s;toral office will
therefore de&s;erve your mo&s;t careful &s;tudy. Such
of them as mo&s;t &s;trictly regard individuals, I &s;hall

<P>I BEGIN with a duty in &s;ome re&s;pects unlike to
all others belonging to the pa&s;toral office, and
&s;ingular in its kind, but of the greate&s;t import|ance;
and for both the&s;e rea&s;ons, fit to introduce
the catalogue; good example. The &s;cripture ex|pre&s;sly
enjoins this as one of the duties of the
<PB N="101" REF="108">
office. Paul commands Timothy to be &startq;an ex|ample
to the believers, in word, in conver&s;a|tion,
in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 12.</NOTE>&endq;
and Titus, to &startq;&s;how him&s;elf in all things a pattern
of good works<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 7.</NOTE>;&endq; and Peter requires, as indi&s;|pen&s;ably
incumbent on all elders, to be &startq;en&s;am|ples
to the flock<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 3.</NOTE>.&endq; It cannot require many
words to evince, that, though all Chri&s;tians are
under a real obligation to give a good example, yet
mini&s;ters are under peculiar obligations to it, as
&s;pecially their duty.</P>
<P>They are under peculiar obligations to it, becau&s;e
their office gives them peculiar advantages for be|coming
exemplarily good. A great part of the
vices of other men ari&s;es from the temptations to
which they are expo&s;ed in the cour&s;e of their ordi|nary
bu&s;ine&s;s. Each of them has a temporal voca|tion,
the direct end of which does not coincide
with that of their &s;piritual calling, and which &s;ome|times
therefore leads them off from the duties of it.
But mini&s;ters have no temporal vocation; their
particular as well as their eneral calling is of a
&s;piritual nature. Their occupation is to teach
religion, to enforce a lively &s;en&s;e of it, to inculcate
the practice of all virtue. Every attempt of this
kind is an act of virtue, which tends directly to
<PB N="102" REF="109">
their own improvement. They cannot go about
their functions, without having religious and moral
con&s;iderations, precepts, motives, &s;entiments, ex|amples,
or rules of virtue, often pre&s;ented to their
thoughts, and impre&s;&s;ed upon them, &s;ometimes
with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and affecting circum|&s;tances.
Having &s;o many and great advantages
ari&s;ing from the very nature of their profe&s;&s;ion,
they are doubtle&s;s, in the &s;ight of God, under a
&s;trict obligation to exemplary goodne&s;s<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2. Burnet, Pa&s;t. Care, c. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is the very end and de&s;ign of their office to
recommend goodne&s;s to the love and practice of
men. A &s;hining example of all real goodne&s;s is
the mo&s;t effectual means of reaching this end. It
is needle&s;s to enlarge here upon its power: its
influence, both in directing and in exciting, is uni|ver&s;ally
acknowleged. Mini&s;ters are therefore no
le&s;s indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to give a good example,
than to aim at the de&s;ign of their calling<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Campbell's Syn. Serm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such example is, further, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
for rendering all the other means that can be u&s;ed,
effectual for an&s;wering their purpo&s;e. Without
being him&s;elf virtuous, a mini&s;ter cannot u&s;e any
of the&s;e means with &s;pirit. If he be irreligious or
vicious, he cannot heartily or even &s;incerely oppo&s;e
irreligion and vice: he can &s;carcely have the
<PB N="103" REF="110">
effrontery to attempt it. If he could put on this
effrontery, and become even &s;o much a ma&s;ter of
hypocri&s;y as to &s;eem to be in earne&s;t, it would
have no effect. If his private conduct be not un|blameable,
his doctrine cannot be regarded. If
the people &s;ee him immer&s;ed in the world all
the week, he can &s;carcely expect to per&s;uade them
to renounce the love of it, by all that he can &s;ay
on the Lord's day. Warnings again&s;t &s;in, or
reproofs of other men's faults, come with a very ill
grace, and can have very little weight, from the
per&s;on whom his hearers know to be him&s;elf
addicted to the &s;ame or to any other vice. They
will forwardly conclude, that he him&s;elf believes not
what he &s;ays, becau&s;e his life is nowi&s;e &s;uitable to it.
They will hear him without attention, with indiffer|ence,
with prejudice, and de&s;pi&s;e all his exhort|ations
as mere form, as unfelt declamation. The
vicious will take encouragement from his practice,
in every thing that is faulty in their own. The
be&s;t men will hear him with di&s;ta&s;te and even with
horror, condemning him&s;elf in what they know
that he allows and does. But when a mini&s;ter is
him&s;elf uniformly pious and virtuous, he will be
able to deliver whatever regards the faith or prac|tice
of men with force and energy. It proceeds
from his own heart; and it will be evident that his
heart is in it. He will deliver it with boldne&s;s and
freedom, unre&s;trained by any apprehen&s;ion that
the hearers may retort upon him, &startq;Thou which
teache&s;t another, teache&s;t thou not thy&s;elf?&endq;
<PB N="104" REF="111">
When in his life he gives an example of all the
chri&s;tian virtues which he recommends, it will add
weight to all his exhortations to them. Sen&s;ible
from their effects on his own conduct, that he
firmly believes the truths of religion, men will
li&s;ten to his repre&s;entations of them with attention,
with docility, and with an opinion of their import|ance.
From his lively faith in divine truth, they
will catch, by &s;ympathy, a like faith in it; from his
vigorous perception of it, a like perception; and
from his love of virtue, &s;ome degree of affection
to it. Convinced that he is &s;incere in all he &s;ays,
and that he earne&s;tly de&s;ires their good, they will
receive it with a favourable ear, and be prepared
to allow his arguments, his directions, his admo|nitions,
their full influence upon them<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Pa&s;t. Care. Stillingfleet, Eccl. Ca&s;es, p. 65.
Secker, Ch. 1. Oxf. Ch. 2. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bad example in a mini&s;ter not only renders his
own in&s;tructions ineffectual, but tends likewi&s;e to
weaken the force of all religion. Concluding na|turally
enough from his conduct, that he does not
truly believe religion, and prone to ju&s;tify them|&s;elves
in their vices, the irreligious will allow them|&s;elves
to argue, that he who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to exa|mine
and to teach it, could not fail to be convinced
of its truth and to act accordingly, if it were really
true and practicable: and the weak and thoughtle&s;s
will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be affected by this &s;ort of
<PB N="105" REF="112">
arguing; and contract, if not a di&s;belief of reli|gion,
at lea&s;t a total indifference and inattention to
it, almo&s;t equally fatal to their &s;ouls. On the
contrary, when a mini&s;ter exerci&s;es exemplary
virtue, his conduct cannot but, by the &s;ame way
of thinking, appear to the generality a &s;trong con|firmation
of the truth and importance of religion.
Ob&s;erving that &s;uch as have had be&s;t acce&s;s and
been at greate&s;t pains to examine it, in&s;tead of di&s;|covering
any fallacy in its evidences, believe it &s;o
firmly as to yield them&s;elves up wholly to its influ|ence,
they are more &s;ettled in their conviction that
it is perfectly well founded, and ought to regulate
their conduct. Perceiving what effects it actually
produces in the&s;e in&s;tances, they are &s;atisfied that
it ought to produce them, and that it is their own
fault if it produce them not in them&s;elves, and
become better di&s;po&s;ed to comply with its obliga|tions.
Becau&s;e a good example in mini&s;ters thus
coincides perfectly in its tendency with the very
purpo&s;e of their office, it is plainly and indi&s;pen&s;ably
their duty to teach by example.</P>
<P>This duty implies, at the very lowe&s;t, careful
ab&s;tinence, and entire freedom from all real and
acknowleged vice. Without this a mini&s;ter would
give an ill example. Some vices are &s;o po&s;itive in
their nature, and &s;hew them&s;elves in &s;uch obvious or
determinate acts, that they cannot fail to be ob|&s;erved
by men, as intemperance, lewdne&s;s, lying,
inju&s;tice, &s;wearing, expre&s;&s;ions of impiety. The&s;e
<PB N="106" REF="113">
will always appear &s;candalous in a mini&s;ter, and
cannot but be generally taken notice of. It is not
enough that he does not live in the&s;e vices; it is
his duty to keep at a great di&s;tance from all appear|ance
of them. If he be not even noted for tem|perance,
moderation, truth, ju&s;tice, and decency,
his behaviour, in&s;tead of being exemplary, will be
offen&s;ive; in&s;tead of improving, corruptive. Some
omi&s;&s;ions of duty likewi&s;e are &s;o palpable, that the
ob&s;ervation of them in a mini&s;ter mu&s;t give great
&s;candal, and tend to weaken men's &s;en&s;e of the
general obligations of religion; as the omi&s;&s;ion of
acts of devotion, or performing them with manife&s;t
reluctance and indi&s;po&s;ition when occa&s;ion plainly
requires them. A mini&s;ter who allows him&s;elf in
them mu&s;t do hurt by his example; his character
will be odious, and all his labours u&s;ele&s;s. Other
vices, the indications of which are more indefinite
and equivocal, or which may, by &s;ome artful
colouring, be pa&s;&s;ed on the undi&s;cerning for virtues,
will not be &s;o generally ob&s;erved, but whenever
they are detected, will be as much dete&s;ted, and
will as much enervate the influence of his mini&s;try,
who is found to be addicted to them<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Pa&s;t. Care. Secker, Ch. 1. Oxf. Ch. 2. Cant.
Campbell's Syn. Serm. Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not &s;top here: we mu&s;t remark
farther, that in order to render his conduct exem|plary,
a mini&s;ter mu&s;t ab&s;tain from or be very
<PB N="107" REF="114">
cautious in u&s;ing many things which are, con&s;idered
&s;imply in them&s;elves, in a great mea&s;ure, indiffer|ent.
Of this kind are &s;uch overflowings of good
humour as approach very near to levity. Exce&s;&s;ive
mirth will &s;eem to indicate that the important views
and affecting &s;entiments which his functions tend
to bring frequently into his mind, and to render
habitual to him, have taken little hold of him, and
are forgotten and di&s;regarded by him. Cheerful
he ought to be; but his cheerfulne&s;s &s;hould be
con&s;i&s;tent with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, recollection, and &s;elf|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
Of the &s;ame kind are &s;uch amu&s;ements
and public diver&s;ions as, though perhaps innocent,
are, from an opinion of their indicating levity and
di&s;&s;ipation, from a mi&s;conception of them as having
&s;ome immoral tendency, or &s;uppo&s;e from mere
prejudice, generally pronounced to be unbecoming
the character of a clergyman. From his allowing
him&s;elf in &s;uch gaieties, men will con&s;ider him as
mi&s;-&s;pending the time which his profe&s;&s;ion calls upon
him to apply to much better purpo&s;es; they will
&s;u&s;pect him to be tainted with an immoderate love
of plea&s;ure; and &s;eeing him go con&s;iderable lengths
in gratifying it, they will think them&s;elves autho|ri&s;ed
to go greater lengths, till they be lo&s;t in
thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and dive&s;ted of all attention to
their mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts both in this world and
in the next. With re&s;pect to all things of this
kind, it is by no means a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for a
clergyman's indulging him&s;elf in them, that it is
only an example of real virtue that he is obliged
<PB N="108" REF="115">
to give, and that there is no virtue in ab&s;tinence
from things indifferent; or that, being convinced
of their innocence, he is at liberty to act according
to his own conviction, rather than according to the
groundle&s;s notions of other men. For no man
lives merely to him&s;elf: every man is obliged to
care, not only for his own things, but al&s;o in &s;ome
degree for the things of others; and ought in
every part of his conduct to have &s;ome thought of
how it will affect them: and a mini&s;ter has a pecu|liar
connection with mankind, which demands
from him great con&s;ideration of the influence
which every part of his conduct may rea&s;onably
be expected to have upon their minds. It is cer|tain
that levity, di&s;&s;ipation, and the love of plea|&s;ure,
are unbecoming the character of a mini&s;ter:
it is equally certain that very many will look on
his indulging him&s;elf in the things which have been
mentioned, as an unque&s;tionable mark of the&s;e
faulty di&s;po&s;itions; and therefore cannot fail to be
di&s;gu&s;ted with the indulgence, as giving an example
of real vice. When he knows this, he cannot
be innocent in taking it; he fails in giving a pattern
in a very ea&s;y and nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tance of &s;elf-denial,
which is a real virtue. I will venture to &s;ay far|ther,
that indulgences of this kind, though not
implying any faulty levity in others, really proceed,
in a clergyman, from a levity that is blameable,
and a fondne&s;s for plea&s;ure which is criminal; and
that, if he hone&s;tly examine his own heart, he will
find the&s;e to be the actual principles of his conduct.
<PB N="109" REF="116">
For no other principle could make the gratification
ari&s;ing from the&s;e to appear of &s;uch value in his
eyes, that for the &s;ake of it he will offend multi|tudes,
and very much le&s;&s;en his own u&s;efulne&s;s.
Accordingly, it will be found that tho&s;e clergymen
who betray the &s;tronge&s;t inclination to di&s;regard the
common notions of decency in articles of this kind,
are not generally, if ever, the mo&s;t blamele&s;s in
other parts of their behaviour, the mo&s;t eminent for
piety and virtue, the mo&s;t diligent in the duties of
their office, or the more zealous for its end; but
that on the contrary they &s;hew in other matters
&s;ome fault either of the heart or of the head. It is
&s;ometimes pled, that a mini&s;ter's ab&s;tinence from
&s;uch innocent and indifferent things will lead the
weak to think that he him&s;elf condemns them, and
will fo&s;ter their &s;uper&s;tition, confirm them in their
narrow prejudices, and encourage their cen&s;orious
humour. But there is no &s;olidity in the plea.
For, in the fir&s;t place, to de&s;pi&s;e their weakne&s;s,
and violently to combat their prejudices, is not a
probable way of curing them: it tends more to
confirm them, than even compliance with them;
e&s;pecially if he who acts in contempt or defiance of
them in &s;uch particulars, &s;eem likewi&s;e exception|able
in other re&s;pects. Be&s;ides, a mini&s;ter may
ab&s;tain from what would offend, and yet let the
people know that he does &s;o only from a tenderne&s;s
to their weakne&s;s, and that he him&s;elf is fully con|vinced
of the lawfulne&s;s of the things from which
he ab&s;tains. When it is plain that &s;uch a decla|ration
<PB N="110" REF="117">
is not nece&s;&s;ary for a vindication of him&s;elf,
it will be the better received, and the fitte&s;t for
removing their groundle&s;s prejudices. It is certain
that amu&s;ements which have at one time been rec|koned
unreputable in a clergyman, have by a
general change of manners cea&s;ed to be thought &s;o
at another. But &s;uch a change of manners mu&s;t
be left to come on gradually and of its own accord;
it cannot be forced in an in&s;tant even by the autho|rity
of laws; the man who attempts it by the
ob&s;tinacy of his private practice, is &s;ure to hurt
him&s;elf. In &s;uch in&s;tances re&s;pecting the clergy,
they who are readie&s;t to attempt it, the younger
and tho&s;e of the lea&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed and perhaps not
the mo&s;t unexceptionable reputation, are the &s;ure&s;t
to hurt them&s;elves by it, and the mo&s;t unlikely to
produce any favourable alteration in the &s;entiments
of mankind. But if the attempt &s;hould &s;ucceed,
what mighty advantage is gained? A little more
liberty to him&s;elf in &s;uch trifles as no wi&s;e man
can reckon of the lea&s;t importance to his happine&s;s,
and no good pa&s;tor can think worth his running
the ri&s;k of lo&s;ing, for their &s;ake, the &s;malle&s;t
grain of his u&s;efulne&s;s. Perhaps too &s;ome encou|ragement
will be given to others, in that attach|ment
to amu&s;ement, frivolity, or &s;hew, which is
already too prevalent, and of the mo&s;t pernicious
influence: a con&s;equence to which every &s;entiment
and view becoming a clergyman, &s;hould con&s;train him
from contributing. There is no doubt con&s;iderable
delicacy, in many ca&s;es, in determining how a man
<PB N="111" REF="118">
had be&s;t act, with re&s;pect to giving offence by
things indifferent or of little moment. The be&s;t
general rule that can be laid down is, that a mini&s;ter
ought never to do or even &s;eem to approve any thing
that is unlawful, in order to avoid di&s;plea&s;ing others;
but that he ought willingly to ab&s;tain from many
things which are lawful or which would be agree|able
to him, rather than give offence to any. Such
decency is truly nece&s;&s;ary for his teaching and edi|fying
by example.</P>
<P>But it is not enough that he give no bad ex|ample:
it is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary that he be a pattern
of good works to the people. In order to this it
is fir&s;t of all nece&s;&s;ary that he really be a good
man. In&s;incere appearances of goodne&s;s, however
artfully affected, will always be unnatural. How|ever
&s;tudiou&s;ly they be kept up, the ma&s;k will fall
off at &s;ome time or another; the detected hypo|crite
will be de&s;pi&s;ed or dete&s;ted by all men: and
though he &s;hould never be detected by men, he is
abominable in the &s;ight of God. A temper of
Chri&s;tian virtue con&s;i&s;ts of many parts; a mini&s;ter
mu&s;t cultivate them all: were it po&s;&s;ible that he
could po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome virtues without the re&s;t, they
could neither atone for his defects in the judgment
of God, nor prevent &s;candal from them in the
judgment of the world. Virtue really prevailing
in the heart will naturally lead to good practice;
and that it may be exemplary, the proper exertions
of it mu&s;t not be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or di&s;&s;embled. Vir|tuous
<PB N="112" REF="119">
di&s;po&s;itions which are &s;incere, often fail of
recommending them&s;elves to imitation, by being
imperfectly exerted. It is only by being exerted
that they can be perceived by others; and till they
perceive them, they cannot copy after them. It
is of the mo&s;t diligent practice of virtue and of the
&s;tricte&s;t regard to religion, that mini&s;ters are bound
to be patterns. But to neglect or to di&s;gui&s;e the
exerci&s;e of any virtue, when there is a proper op|portunity
for it, is to neglect the virtue in that
in&s;tance, and often implies even a po&s;itive tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
of the obligations which it lays them
under. They ought, in every &s;ituation, boldly to
avow and pro&s;ecute the conduct which religion
requires from them. At the &s;ame time, they mu&s;t
carefully avoid o&s;tentation in the exertion of their
virtues. This could not fail to di&s;gu&s;t, and would
very probably rai&s;e a &s;u&s;picion of hypocri&s;y. They
mu&s;t leave their light to &s;hine before men by its
own &s;plendour, without either &s;tudying to ob&s;cure
it, or endeavouring to render it glaring. It is by
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing virtue in &s;incerity and in &s;trength, that
they will be&s;t pre&s;erve this happy medium. To
render their virtue exemplary, it is likewi&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary
that their manner of practi&s;ing it be &s;uch as
will render it attractive. For this purpo&s;e they
mu&s;t keep at a di&s;tance from forbidding au&s;terity,
and &s;tudy to &s;hew its native loveline&s;s by accom|panying
it with cheerfulne&s;s, courte&s;y, and conde|&s;cen&s;ion.
They mu&s;t pre&s;erve the &s;everal virtues
from tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es or adulterations which would
<PB N="113" REF="120">
fully their beauty. Their piety mu&s;t be alike
remote from &s;uper&s;tition and from enthu&s;ia&s;m;
their integrity, though inflexible, mu&s;t be free
from &s;everity; their humility, from meanne&s;s;
their gravity, from moro&s;ene&s;s; their cheerfulne&s;s,
from levity; their zeal, from bitterne&s;s. By acting
in this manner, mini&s;ters will exhibit an in&s;inu|ating
example of every good quality that can
adorn the &s;oul, and will in &s;ome mea&s;ure gain both
the love and the imitation of their people.</P>

<P>BECAUSE knowlege is the only foundation of
religious and virtuous practice, and mu&s;t be con|veyed
to men before they can be excited to a
becoming conduct, it is the primary duty of the
pa&s;toral office to in&s;truct men in the doctrines and
duties of religion. Pa&s;tors are therefore called
&startq;teachers<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 11.</NOTE>;&endq; and their whole office is often
de&s;cribed by &startq;teaching.&endq; Chri&s;t's charge to his
di&s;ciples, after his re&s;urrection, was, &startq;Teach all
nations; teach them to ob&s;erve all things what|&s;oever
I have commanded you<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 19, 20.</NOTE>.&endq; In con&s;e|quence
of this charge, his apo&s;tles &startq;went forth,
<PB N="114" REF="121">
and preached every where<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mark, xvi. 20.</NOTE>,&endq; and &startq;cea&s;ed not
to teach and preach Je&s;us Chri&s;t<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Acts, v. 42.</NOTE>.&endq; The &s;ame
practice they expre&s;sly require from all mini&s;ters of
the go&s;pel. &startq;A bi&s;hop,&endq; &s;ays Paul, &startq;mu&s;t be
apt to teach<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 2.</NOTE>:&endq; &startq;the&s;e things command and
teach<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 11.</NOTE>:&endq; &startq;the&s;e things teach and exhort<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 2.</NOTE>.&endq;
By the practice of the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, whom we
&s;hould regard as our examples, it is clearly a&s;cer|tained,
that the&s;e and the many &s;imilar precepts
require not only public preaching, but al&s;o private
in&s;truction. The apo&s;tles at Jeru&s;alem, not only
&startq;daily in the temple,&endq; but likewi&s;e &startq;in every
hou&s;e, cea&s;ed not to teach<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Acts, v. 42.</NOTE>:&endq; and Paul appeals
to the Ephe&s;ians, that, during the three years he
had lived among them, not only publicly, but al&s;o
&startq;from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, he had taught them, and
&s;hewed them, and kept back nothing that was
profitable, and had not cea&s;ed to warn every
man night and day with tears<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 20. 31.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>As the&s;e ob&s;ervations evidently &s;hew that private
in&s;truction is a duty of the pa&s;toral office, &s;o the
&s;lighte&s;t attention to its nature and its con&s;equences
is &s;ufficient to prove that it is a very important duty.
Whoever makes the trial will &s;oon di&s;cover that
there is, in the bulk of every pari&s;h, ignorance and
inattention enough to render it nece&s;&s;ary. Public
<PB N="115" REF="122">
di&s;cour&s;es delivered in a promi&s;cuous audience are
almo&s;t unavoidably too uniform and general to &s;uit
the various capacities and &s;ituations of all the
hearers. In di&s;cour&s;es &s;tudied by a man of liberal
education, there can &s;carcely fail to be a degree
of compo&s;ition, requi&s;ite likewi&s;e, it may be,
for preventing di&s;gu&s;t in the more knowing,
which mu&s;t render a great part of every &s;ermon
of little u&s;e to the ignorant, who bear no incon|&s;iderable
proportion in all ordinary congrega|tions.
Amends can be made only by a mini&s;ter's
entering frequently into private conver&s;ation,
on religious &s;ubjects, with &s;ome or other of his
people.</P>
<P>He may in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with little trouble to
him&s;elf, contribute to the in&s;truction of all who
can read, by recommending proper books to them.
Only &s;uch books as are cheap, and written in the
plaine&s;t manner, can an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. The
greate&s;t part of tho&s;e that fall under this de&s;crip|tion
are very exceptionable, not only being in a
&s;tyle indecently mean, but abounding in &s;lighty,
improper, or enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;entiments. It is to be
regretted that &s;uch are mo&s;t generally current
among the lower ranks, and mo&s;t acceptable to
them. It were much to be wi&s;hed that there were
a variety of others at lea&s;t equally plain, intelli|gible,
and familiar, but &s;ober and wholly practical.
No compo&s;itions could be more really or exten|&s;ively
u&s;eful. Were there, however, the greate&s;t
<PB N="116" REF="123">
abundance of &s;uch, it could not &s;uper&s;ede the
obligation which lies on mini&s;ters to give their
own private in&s;tructions to their people: but
the paucity of them mu&s;t &s;trengthen the obliga|tion.</P>
<P>There is no doctrine or duty of religion, which
a mini&s;ter may not find proper occa&s;ions of explain|ing
or enforcing in private, or with individuals of
his pari&s;h &s;eparately. He may give them in&s;truc|tion
concerning many things which they know not,
and directions for particulars in their conduct,
which could &s;carcely be introduced into a public
di&s;cour&s;e: he may expre&s;s and illu&s;trate them in a
more familiar manner, and &s;et them in a greater
variety of lights, than would be allowable in
preaching, till he find that the per&s;on with whom
he conver&s;es, comprehends them perfectly: he
may de&s;cend to minuter in&s;tances of behaviour,
and to advices concerning more trivial actions,
than would be con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the
pulpit. In private teaching, a mini&s;ter has &s;o
great advantage for adapting him&s;elf to the various
capacities and turns of the different per&s;ons to
whom he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, that the lower &s;ort
will reap more benefit from half an hour of &s;uch
conver&s;ation prudently conducted, than from the
&s;ermons of a whole year<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Wil&s;on, vol. i. p. 215, 218, 219.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="124">
Whatever is of greate&s;t importance in religion,
ought to be mo&s;t frequently introduced, and mo&s;t
&s;tudiou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on, by a mini&s;ter, in his private
in&s;tructions to his people. For this rea&s;on, what
is practical will claim his chief attention. He will
&s;oon di&s;cover that, when &s;ome of the common
people affect more knowlege than their neighbours,
it is generally of a very fal&s;e and perverted kind.
They con&s;ider knowlege as be&s;t di&s;played in de|ciding
que&s;tions of curiou&s;ity and difficulty: and
by reading and venting ab&s;urdities on &s;uch points,
they &s;eem to them&s;elves and to others of their own
rank, to be very learned, and, as they term it,
great &s;cholars. It is not uncommon to meet with
per&s;ons in a country pari&s;h inqui&s;itive about &s;uch
que&s;tions as the&s;e: At what &s;ea&s;on of the year
the world was created? How long the &s;tate of
innocence continued? Of what &s;pecies was the
fruit of the forbidden tree? Whether original or
actual &s;in was fir&s;t? What was the mark &s;et upon
Cain? &amp;c. And in compari&s;on with &s;uch trifling,
u&s;ele&s;s, or ab&s;urd que&s;tions, they de&s;pi&s;e the plain
doctrines and duties of religion, as things &s;o ea&s;y,
that acquaintance with them requires no ingenuity,
and confers little merit. The prevalence of this
di&s;po&s;ition renders it nece&s;&s;ary for a mini&s;ter to
take every opportunity, in private as well as in
public, to draw them off from frivolous and unpro|fitable
&s;ubtleties and &s;peculations, and to inculcate
on them, that the only valuable knowlege is that
which tends to influence the practice. The &s;ort of
<PB N="118" REF="125">
people of whom we are &s;peaking, are always con|ceited,
and will be abundantly forward to obtrude
their vain que&s;tions on their mini&s;ter. Some of
the&s;e are perfectly unintelligible, and more of them
wholly indeterminable. In this ca&s;e, the be&s;t way
is, to interrogate tho&s;e who pretend to be ac|quainted
with them, to lead them on by po&s;ing
them, till they involve them&s;elves in contradiction
and non&s;en&s;e, that thus they may be brought to
convince them&s;elves of their ab&s;urdity. When the
que&s;tions about which they dote are intelligible,
and perhaps curious in them&s;elves, but, like all
ab&s;tru&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions, have no connection with
practice, it will be prudent for a mini&s;ter, not alto|gether
to decline an&s;wering them; for the con|ceitedne&s;s
of the propo&s;ers would impute this to his
ignorance. Let him enter upon the &s;ubject; &s;ug|ge&s;t
the arguments on both &s;ides, if it be a matter
of uncertainty, or the proofs of it, if it be only
ab&s;tru&s;e. After having thus &s;hewn them that he
under&s;tands it better than them&s;elves, he may with
&s;afety, and probably not without &s;ucce&s;s, repre&s;ent
&s;uch inquiries as of no moment, and inculcate
upon them, that true knowlege is only what tends
to make men better, and that religion con&s;i&s;ts in
the goodne&s;s which naturally proceeds from &s;uch
knowlege, not in the mere knowlege &s;eparated
from that effect. In both the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;uch con|duct
is conformable to that of Chri&s;t, the great
pattern of Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters. Sometimes he puz|zled
tho&s;e who attacked him, by putting appo&s;ite
<PB N="119" REF="126">
que&s;tions, or making unan&s;werable remarks.
&startq;Whether is it ea&s;ier to &s;ay, Thy &s;ins be forgiven

how is he his &s;on<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 45.</NOTE>?&endq; On almo&s;t all the occa|&s;ions
to which the&s;e retorts belong, and indeed on
every occa&s;ion, and whatever was the &s;ubject intro|duced,
he was careful to turn his di&s;cour&s;e to
matters of practice. Not content with pointing
out the ab&s;urdity of a&s;cribing his miracles to Beel|zebub,
he &s;ubjoins an alarming warning of their
danger, and important maxims and directions for
their conduct, particularly as re&s;pecting their
words and conver&s;ation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Having confounded
them by his que&s;tion concerning John's bapti&s;m,
he &s;ubjoined two mo&s;t in&s;tructive parables, and
applied them forcibly to their practice<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxi. 28, &amp;c.</NOTE>. By the
very deci&s;ion which he gave in the que&s;tion concern|ing
<PB N="120" REF="127">
the paying of tribute, he inculcated &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to civil government. The que&s;tion concerning
the greate&s;t of the commandments, as di&s;puted
among the rabbis, was frivolous, regarding only
the preference of one ceremony to another: when
it was captiou&s;ly propo&s;ed to Je&s;us, he &s;eized the
opportunity of fixing their attention on the love of
God and of mankind, in preference to all cere|monies<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 37.</NOTE>.
A di&s;ciple a&s;ked him, &startq;Are there few
that be &s;aved?&endq; a que&s;tion often moved by mere
curio&s;ity, and that not of the mo&s;t liberal or bene|volent
kind: in&s;tead of gratifying curio&s;ity, his
an&s;wer only points out the difficulties of religion,
and urges all pre&s;ent to that diligence in combating
them, without which they them&s;elves could not be
&s;aved: &startq;Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 24.</NOTE>.&endq;
When Peter a&s;ked Je&s;us concerning John, &startq;And
what &s;hall this man do?&endq; he both checked his
u&s;ele&s;s curio&s;ity, and pointed out his own bu&s;ine&s;s:
&startq;What is that to thee? Follow thou me<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">John, xxi. 22.</NOTE>.&endq; In
like manner, when his di&s;ciples a&s;ked him, &startq;Wilt
thou at this time re&s;tore the kingdom to I&s;rael?&endq;
he fir&s;t intimated his di&s;approbation of their putting
the que&s;tion; &startq;It is not for you to know the
times or the &s;ea&s;ons:&endq; and next made it a
handle for giving them very important information,
that they &s;hould &startq;receive power&endq; by &startq;the Holy
Gho&s;t coming upon&endq; them, and for turning
<PB N="121" REF="128">
their attention to their peculiar duty, which was,
to &startq;be witne&s;&s;es unto him&endq; every where<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But
the in&s;tances of Chri&s;t's pur&s;uing this conduct,
are innumerable. His uniform practice &s;hews that
one of the principal &s;ubjects of private in&s;truction,
indeed of all in&s;truction, ought to be, to inculcate
upon men that all true religion is practical; and
that the in&s;truction &s;hould always ultimately aim
at practice, and tend to in&s;till &s;uch &s;entiments as
are fit to influence practice.</P>
<P>All private in&s;tructions are in a great mea&s;ure
occa&s;ional: and it will add to their weight, that
they &s;pring naturally from the occa&s;ion, and that
they be &s;uitable to it. Chri&s;t has given Chri&s;tian
teachers an example of addre&s;s, both in &s;eizing
every proper occa&s;ion, and in adapting their in|&s;tructions
to it. The in&s;tances ju&s;t now produced
might alone prove this: and there are many other
in&s;tances. From the common occurrences and in|cidental
conver&s;ations which he met with, he took
an opportunity of propo&s;ing his divine in&s;tructions
to &s;uch as happened to be pre&s;ent. Some per&s;ons
talked &startq;of the Galileans who&s;e blood Pilate had
mingled with their &s;acrifices;&endq; it would &s;eem as
a piece of ordinary news: he u&s;ed it as a natural
occa&s;ion, both for di&s;couraging the &s;pirit of ra&s;h
and pre&s;umptuous judgment, and for a&s;&s;erting the
<PB N="122" REF="129">
nece&s;&s;ity of repentance and enforcing the exerci&s;e
of it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Indeed, almo&s;t all his in&s;tructions were
drawn from the objects that &s;urrounded him, or
the &s;ituations and events which occurred, at the
time. With regard to many of them, this is
evident from the relations of the evangeli&s;ts; with
regard to others, it may be deduced from a com|pari&s;on
of circum&s;tances; and it holds &s;o gene|rally,
that &s;ome writers have reckoned attention
to the occa&s;ion of his di&s;cour&s;es, as indicated by
the &s;ubject or the turn of them, &s;ufficient for ad|ju&s;ting,
in many ca&s;es, the time and order of them,
and of the actions connected with them<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Law's Theory, p. 302&mdash;315. Lamy Harmon. pa&s;&s;im.
Cleri a Harm. Jortin's Di&s;cour&s;es, p. 201, &amp;c.</NOTE>. His
divine knowlege qualified him for doing this with
perfect ea&s;e and propriety. In&s;piration &s;itted his
apo&s;tles for copying this manner of teaching; and
they copied it &s;o much that, not only &s;uch of their
di&s;cour&s;es as are recorded, but their writings al&s;o,
grow out of particular occa&s;ions. To unin&s;pired
teachers, it cannot fail to be attended with con&s;i|derable
difficulty; and they mu&s;t be liable to go
&s;ometimes wrong in the execution of it. This
&s;hould only lead them to employ the greater pains
and &s;tudy in preparing them&s;elves for it. It can|not
extingui&s;h their obligation to attempt it. It is
the mo&s;t ea&s;y, natural, and &s;triking mode of in|&s;truction
that can be imagined; and the only
<PB N="123" REF="130">
proper mode of private in&s;truction. By means of
it, every thing is improved into an u&s;eful moral;
it touches the more by its congruity to the pre&s;ent
&s;ituation and circum&s;tances of the hearer; and it
will be more ea&s;ily retained and more affectingly
recollected, by the commone&s;t objects and events,
as having been originally connected with it, be|coming
ever after monitors and remembrancers
of it<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Law's Theory, p. 302&mdash;315.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not, however, alike ea&s;y to introduce occa|&s;ional
in&s;tructions, to all &s;orts of people. Were a
mini&s;ter to attempt &s;ugge&s;ting them to mo&s;t people
of rank and fa&s;hion, on as &s;lender an occa&s;ion as
would procure them attention from the well-di&s;|po&s;ed,
and at lea&s;t a hearing from the common
people in general, or to pur&s;ue them with as much
freedom, he would run a great ri&s;k of being de|&s;pi&s;ed
as a per&s;on totally ignorant of good breeding,
ridiculed as a pedant, and perhaps, in exemplifica|tion
of their boa&s;ted politene&s;s, abu&s;ed as imperti|nent
and pragmatical. It is only for the &s;ake of
doing good, that religious in&s;tructions &s;hould be
occa&s;ionally &s;ugge&s;ted: when it is certain that they
can do no good, or mo&s;t probable that they will
do harm, a mini&s;ter can be under no obligation to
throw them away. But it is only where the ca&s;e
<PB N="124" REF="131">
is very plain, that he can be excu&s;ed from every
e&s;&s;ay: opportunities, which &s;eem to be very unfa|vourable,
may, by the prudent improvement of
them, turn out to real advantage. It would be
pernicious, rather than beneficial, to be con&s;tantly
obtruding religious &s;entiments, grave reflections,
and maxims of morality, on the conver&s;ation of
the higher ranks. A mini&s;ter &s;hould be careful
not to attempt it in &s;uch a way as will prevent
tho&s;e good effects, for the &s;ake of which alone it is
incumbent on him: and in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the
world, it will require very great prudence and de|licacy
to manage it &s;o, that there &s;hall be a proba|bility
of its producing good effects. Serious in|&s;tructions
&s;hould be brought in &s;paringly: &s;eldom,
except when a very natural occa&s;ion offers, and in
a manner invites them. They &s;hould not be ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in a &s;ententious and authoritative way,
which carries with it a forbidding air of &s;olemnity
and affectation. They &s;hould not be in&s;i&s;ted on at
large, &s;o as to turn them into formal or tedious
harangues; but ju&s;t hinted at, and &s;ugge&s;ted with
the appearance of unde&s;igning ea&s;e and good hu|mour.
By this means they may be, on &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions,
introduced to any per&s;on, not only with|out
giving offence, but even &s;o as to be agreeable,
and &s;o as to be recollected afterwards, pur&s;ued
perhaps by the per&s;on him&s;elf, and applied to their
proper u&s;e. The more difficult this is, the more
&s;olicitous we &s;hould be to contrive a proper method
<PB N="125" REF="132">
of doing it, and the more careful to learn the re|qui&s;ite
addre&s;s<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Secker, Ch. 2. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is much le&s;s difficulty in introducing reli|gious
and moral &s;ubjects among the lower ranks.
Though they have often no great concern about
&s;uch &s;ubjects, yet their minds are not debauched
with fal&s;e politene&s;s, nor are they with-held by any
capricious ideas of fa&s;hion from propo&s;ing or li&s;ten|ing
to them. They will think it very natural, and
very right, for a mini&s;ter to pa&s;s from ordinary
talk upon common &s;ubjects, to religious ob&s;erva|tions.
He may make the tran&s;ition with little ce|remony;
and he can never want occa&s;ions of
doing &s;o. Whatever be the conver&s;ation into
which he happens to enter with any of his pa|ri&s;hioners,
he may find a handle for introducing
&s;ome in&s;tructive topic, without even &s;eeming to
de&s;ign it, and of &s;ugge&s;ting remarks which will
either improve their knowlege or influence their
practice. And if it be once ob&s;erved, as it very
&s;oon will be, that a mini&s;ter is ready to enter into
conver&s;ation of this kind, the people will willingly
give him opportunities of in&s;tructing them, and
even a&s;k his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in explaining &s;omething
which they find it difficult to under&s;tand, or di|recting

without giving any offence to the common people,
dwell upon it longer, inculcate it more profe&s;&s;edly,
and illu&s;trate it more formally and fully, than

only in&s;inuate in&s;truction, will depend on many
particular circum&s;tances, and mu&s;t be left to every
man's own prudence.</P>
<P>There are very many religious &s;ubjects which the
mo&s;t ordinary conver&s;ation with his people gives
a mini&s;ter a natural opportunity of introducing.
Since all nature is the work of God, and all its
operations are carried on by him as the fir&s;t cau&s;e,
a mountain or a valley, a river or a lake, a barren
or a fertile field, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the pro|gre&s;s
of vegetables, the nature and effects of the
weather, and a thou&s;and other objects the mo&s;t
common, with the conver&s;ation concerning them,
into which per&s;ons fall of cour&s;e every day, natu|rally
&s;ugge&s;t to every thoughtful and well-di&s;po&s;ed
per&s;on, &s;entiments of the divine perfections and
providence; and therefore give a mini&s;ter the mo&s;t
natural opportunity of &s;peaking to any per&s;on on
the&s;e important &s;ubjects, and of making &s;uch re|flections
as may give the ignorant ju&s;ter concep|tions
and farther knowlege of them, render the
thoughtle&s;s more attentive to them, or at any rate
excite a livelier and a more practical &s;en&s;e of them.
By a tran&s;ition no wi&s;e forced, he may likewi&s;e
<PB N="127" REF="134">
take occa&s;ion, from &s;uch common objects, for en|tering
on other &s;ubjects of religion, bearing &s;ome
analogy to them, though not &s;o intimately con|nected
with them. Many of the &s;entiments of
Chri&s;t's &s;ermon on the mount, are drawn from the
objects which that &s;ituation put into his view: a
city on a hill; per&s;ons manuring the fields with
&s;alt; the &s;un &s;hining on all the fields and gardens,
without di&s;tinction, which fell within his exten&s;ive
pro&s;pect; the fowls flying in the air, and the lilies
growing around him: he &s;poke of good trees and
corrupt trees, of knowing men by their fruits, of
grapes not growing upon thorns, nor figs on
thi&s;tles. The go&s;pels contain many other in|&s;tances.</P>
<P>There are religious &s;ubjects &s;uited to many of
the mo&s;t common incidents, and which may there|fore
be introduced on occa&s;ion of them. Almo&s;t
every thing that can furni&s;h a piece of news, has
&s;ome connexion with human conduct, or with the
ways of Providence; and may be ea&s;ily turned to
in&s;inuations or remarks, concerning prudence or
imprudence, faults or excellences of behaviour, the
cau&s;es or the con&s;equences of them, the &s;everal
phenomena of God's pre&s;ent government, the abu&s;e
or the right improvement of them. The actions
of men, or accidental and trivial emergences in
company, may be improved to u&s;eful purpo&s;es.

into any of his people who happen to fall in his

bapti&s;m, its de&s;ign, and the obligations which it
lays men under to holine&s;s.</P>
<P>There are &s;ubjects belonging to religion, and of
great importance, which a mini&s;ter will not perhaps
find either &s;o frequent or &s;o direct occa&s;ions of
&s;liding in&s;en&s;ibly into, and in which it is, not|with&s;tanding,
nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes to give in&s;truc|tion:
&s;uch as, the whole di&s;pen&s;ation of man's
redemption, and all the peculiar doctrines of reve|lation.
The&s;e, whenever he judges it nece&s;&s;ary,
he may very properly introduce without &s;eeking for
any occa&s;ion, or on a very &s;lender occa&s;ion. But
even the&s;e he will find occa&s;ions of introducing &s;o
naturally as to take off the appearance of de&s;ign,
when that appearance might do harm. Such
objects or occurrences as would &s;erve for apt illu&s;|trations
of &s;uch &s;ubjects, may, by a little &s;kill and
addre&s;s, be &s;o managed as to furni&s;h a handle for
pa&s;&s;ing to them. On little children being brought
to him, Chri&s;t very naturally entered on the inno|cence,
humility, and docility, which became his
di&s;ciples, or prepared men for becoming &s;uch, and
the privileges belonging to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e
qualities<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mark, x. 13, &amp;c.</NOTE>. From meat and drink, he led the

his di&s;ciples catching fi&s;h, he pa&s;&s;ed to the employ|ment

to the final &s;eparation of them at the day of judg|ment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiii. 47, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
On ob&s;erving the indications of approach|ing

<P>Among religious and moral &s;ubjects, that &s;hould
be preferred which is mo&s;t &s;uitable to the &s;ituation
of the particular per&s;on to whom in&s;tructions con|cerning
<PB N="131" REF="138">
them are addre&s;&s;ed: and among &s;ubjects
equally &s;uitable to his &s;ituation, that &s;hould at any
time be cho&s;en, which there is the mo&s;t natural
occa&s;ion of introducing. The manner both of
introducing and of inculcating in&s;tructions, &s;hould
likewi&s;e be adapted to the character and circum|&s;tances
of the per&s;on for who&s;e benefit they are
intended. Some private in&s;truction a mini&s;ter
ought to give to all who are committed to his
care: but to &s;ome he will have acce&s;s, and may
with propriety give it more frequently than to
others. It will be peculiarly u&s;eful to take every
opportunity of giving it to the young: their mo|de&s;ty
will di&s;po&s;e them to li&s;ten to it; and the
pliablene&s;s of their minds will contribute to its
having a great influence upon them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Secker, Ch. 2. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Private in&s;truction may be given to per&s;ons at
their work, by the road, or in any &s;ituation. If a
mini&s;ter only keep it in his view as a part of his
duty, he may apply to &s;ome per&s;on or other of his
pari&s;h almo&s;t every day, without any trouble or
inconvenience to him&s;elf. He may turn it into
little more than amu&s;ement. A walk or a ride
may be made the means of holding &s;ome u&s;eful
conver&s;ation with &s;ome of his people. This, he
&s;hould lay it down as a rule to him&s;elf not to omit
<PB N="132" REF="139">
altogether for any day, without a good rea&s;on. I
mean not, that a mini&s;ter &s;hould conver&s;e with his
people upon none but religious &s;ubjects: what has
been &s;aid concerning his &s;eizing occa&s;ions for intro|ducing
them implies, on the contrary, that he
&s;hould often talk with them on other &s;ubjects; and
it is by entering freely into them, and pur&s;uing
them, that he will be be&s;t able to give them &s;uch a
turn as may mo&s;t favour the ea&s;y and natural intro|duction
of his in&s;tructions. Neither do I mean,
that he ought at all times to turn his ordinary con|ver&s;ation
with them into a religious &s;train, or to
moralize on whatever occurs or happens to be
&s;aid. This would be &s;tiff and affected; and it
would be forbidding and di&s;gu&s;ting. But between
this extreme and the other extreme of neglecting
all &s;erious conver&s;ation, all application of common
and incidental things to purpo&s;es of piety and
morality, there is certainly a proper mean: and
this mean is, to do &s;o on every fit occa&s;ion, and to
watch for occa&s;ions of doing &s;o where it is nece&s;&s;ary
or likely to prove u&s;eful.</P>
<P>A per&s;on may do a great deal, through the
cour&s;e of his education and &s;tudies, in qualifying
him&s;elf for this method of private in&s;truction. In
order to this, he &s;hould be careful to &s;tore his mind
with ju&s;t and &s;triking &s;entiments on all religious and
moral &s;ubjects; and to dige&s;t them &s;o well, as to
be able to recollect them quickly when occa&s;ion
calls for them, and to expre&s;s them with ea&s;e and
<PB N="133" REF="140">
per&s;picuity. He may likewi&s;e receive con&s;iderable
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from books, even with re&s;pect to the
particular in&s;tructions &s;uitable to common objects
and incidents, and the proper manner of taking
occa&s;ion from the&s;e to introduce them. There are
many excellent books<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ray's Wi&s;dom of God in the Creation. Derham's Phy&s;ieo|theology, and A&s;tro-theology. Niewentyt's Religious Philo|&s;opher. Spectacle de la Nature.</NOTE> on the works of nature

&s;ome in&s;tances of tran&s;itions from the&s;e to
other &s;ubjects of religion. Acquaintance with &s;uch
books will furni&s;h you with a variety of in&s;tructive
&s;entiments adapted to many common occa&s;ions,
and point out natural methods of applying them
when &s;uch occa&s;ions occur. There are al&s;o<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Flavel's Hu&s;bandry and Navigation &s;piritualized.</NOTE> books
written with a profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign to &s;piritualize or to
moralize the functions and occurrences of parti|cular
occupations, or particular &s;ituations. Mo&s;t
of the&s;e are exceptionable in re&s;pect of the nature
of the in&s;tructions deduced, which are too often
accommodated to the peculiarities of &s;ome one
party &s;y&s;tem, and even that none of the be&s;t; and
&s;uch in&s;tructions you &s;hould wholly and carefully
avoid borrowing. Mo&s;t of them likewi&s;e are often
too fanciful, forcing an application of things to
purpo&s;es to which they are not appo&s;ite; in this
<PB N="134" REF="141">
they ought not to be imitated: at the &s;ame time,
a remoter relation or a le&s;s perfect analogy will
ju&s;tify a tran&s;ition from one &s;ubject to another in
the ea&s;e of private conver&s;ation, than could render
it allowable or prevent its appearing far-fetched in
a written compo&s;ition. From &s;uch books, not|with&s;tanding
all their faults, much a&s;&s;i&s;tance may,
by a judicious and wary &s;election, be procured,
In mo&s;t books on religious and moral &s;ubjects,
&s;entiments are frequently illu&s;trated by images and
compari&s;ons drawn from familiar natural objects or
from the incidents of common life; and from
every in&s;tance of this, one may receive a hint for
&s;ome occa&s;ional in&s;truction: he has only to invert
the order of the train of thought, to begin with
that which furni&s;hes the image of compari&s;on, and
from it to pa&s;s to the religious &s;entiment; whatever
is an apt illu&s;tration of any &s;ubject, may be im|proved
into an occa&s;ion of naturally enough intro|ducing
that &s;ubject into conver&s;ation. You have
acce&s;s not only to &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances in preparing your|&s;elves
for giving private in&s;tructions, but likewi&s;e
to exerci&s;es fit for beginning and forming a habit of
&s;kill in giving them. You may take notice of any
thing which falls in your way that would afford a
mini&s;ter an opportunity for it, or you may &s;uppo&s;e
any &s;ituation, any incident, or any conver&s;ation
that you plea&s;e; and you may con&s;ider deliberately
in what manner, if you &s;hould really meet with it,
you could turn it into a religious channel, or in a
familiar and ea&s;y &s;train deduce u&s;eful in&s;tructions
<PB N="135" REF="142">
from it: you may commit the whole to writing ju&s;t
as you think it ought to pa&s;s or would naturally
pa&s;s in the circum&s;tances &s;uppo&s;ed: you may make
trials of this &s;ort on a great variety of &s;ubjects,
and in different manners; &s;ometimes only ex|pre&s;&s;ing
the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ituation, and hinting the
in&s;truction for which you would take occa&s;ion from
it; &s;ometimes extending the in&s;truction at greater
length; and &s;ometimes carrying on the whole
minutely in the way of dialogue. Such exerci&s;es,
however unu&s;ual, may be very properly intro|duced
into &s;chools of Theology, and will be very
u&s;eful. Each of you may attempt &s;omething of
this kind; the choice of the occa&s;ion, the &s;ubject,
and the manner of pro&s;ecution, I leave entirely to
your&s;elves, but de&s;ire that you may all give &s;ome
&s;pecimen. It will require attention to, or reflec|tion
on, common objects and ordinary incidents;
and in your fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays it may require a good deal
of thought and &s;tudy, and even repeated efforts,
before you &s;ucceed; but accuracy of compo&s;ition
is totally unnece&s;&s;ary, and would rather be im|proper.
You may write down many &s;uch &s;pecimens
in private, when you have lei&s;ure or inclination for
it, or when you meet with any &s;triking occa&s;ion;
and you may revi&s;e them afterwards both for cor|rection
or improvement, and for fixing them in
your thoughts. By this means you will &s;oon be in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of abundance of materials for private
in&s;truction on mo&s;t of the occa&s;ions that can occur
in a pari&s;h; and you will become gradually accu&s;|tomed
<PB N="136" REF="143">
to di&s;cern the proper occa&s;ions for giving
&s;uch in&s;truction, the nature of the in&s;tructions
which will &s;uit them, and the be&s;t ways of pa&s;&s;ing
from the one to the other. You may do more;
you may &s;ometimes have an opportunity of actually
giving in&s;truction to &s;uch as are younger or le&s;s
knowing than your&s;elves; and will readily acknow|lege
them&s;elves your inferiors; and you may find
the mo&s;t natural and favourable opportunities of
giving it explicitly, or at lea&s;t of &s;ugge&s;ting it,
without any ri&s;k of incurring an imputation of
pedantry, affectation, or a&s;&s;uming. What it
is the duty of a mini&s;ter frequently to &s;eek out
occa&s;ions of doing, it cannot be improper that
a candidate for the mini&s;try &s;hould with mode&s;ty
and delicacy attempt doing when the occa&s;ion
invites it.</P>
<P>Thus qualified, in the fir&s;t place, for giving pri|vate
and occa&s;ional in&s;tructions; and, next, dili|gent

This employment will likewi&s;e have the &s;tronge&s;t

<P>EXHORTATION is often joined, in &s;cripture, with

as a duty incumbent upon pa&s;tors.
&startq;Give attendance to exhortation<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 13.</NOTE>. Exhort with

that it &s;hould be performed privately as well
as publicly; and the &s;ame rea&s;ons of nece&s;&s;ity
and of utility hold good for the performance
of it.</P>
<P>To exhort men, is to excite them to the practice
of their &s;everal duties. Teaching and exhortation,
though different in idea, will run in&s;en&s;ibly into
each other; and it will be impo&s;&s;ible to perform the
one aright, without intermixing the other. As all
the principles of true religion are of a practical
<PB N="138" REF="145">
nature, they cannot be properly illu&s;trated without
pointing out their influence on practice; and men
cannot be urged to perform their duties, but by
in&s;i&s;ting on tho&s;e principles of religion which are
the proper motives to the performance of them.
On this account, all the general ob&s;ervations which
have been made, concerning the manner of intro|ducing
and conducting private in&s;truction, are
equally applicable to private exhortation, and need
not be repeated. But &s;till the&s;e two duties are in
&s;ome re&s;pects different, and therefore &s;ome peculiar
ob&s;ervations may be made concerning this latter.
A mini&s;ter &s;hould endeavour almo&s;t every day to
meet with &s;ome or other of his people, and take
occa&s;ion to admoni&s;h and exhort them, to &s;tir them
up to the practice of &s;ome duty, to give them &s;ome
plain directions for their conduct.</P>
<P>In order to perform this duty properly, it is fir&s;t
of all nece&s;&s;ary that a mini&s;ter di&s;cover the parti|cular
&s;ituation and character of the per&s;on to whom
he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, and that he adapt his admo|nitions
carefully to them: for the &s;ame &s;ort of
exhortations does not &s;uit all; and that may be
u&s;ele&s;s or hurtful to one, which is profitable to
another. As no two men are ab&s;olutely undi&s;tin|gui&s;hable
in their faces, though every face be com|po&s;ed
of the &s;ame features; &s;o, though the powers
of human nature, which are the ingredients in
character, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common by all men, yet
by means of the different degrees in which they are
<PB N="139" REF="146">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of the different form which they a&s;&s;ume,
and of the different ways in which they are com|bined,
they produce &s;uch an infinite variety of
characters, that no two are perfectly alike. This
renders it difficult to become acquainted with
human characters, and requires the deepe&s;t in&s;ight
into human nature. But without this it is impo&s;|&s;ible
to apply to men with propriety or &s;ucce&s;s.
One kind of vegetables requires one &s;ort of culture,
and another a &s;ort totally different. One kind of
food &s;uits the con&s;titution of one animal, but
not that of another. What is whole&s;ome to a man
of one temperament, would be almo&s;t poi&s;onous to
a per&s;on of an oppo&s;ite habit. In like manner,
that may be a proper direction to one, which is
entirely u&s;ele&s;s to another; and that may be a
prevailing motive to one, which would have no
weight with another. To pay a due regard to this,
and to be a&s;&s;iduous in giving each per&s;on admoni|tions
and directions peculiarly &s;uited to him&s;elf, is
to come up to the &s;cripture characters of a pa&s;tor.
It is to be &startq;a faithful and wi&s;e &s;teward, ruling

to pur&s;ue this &s;ubject in a proper manner, I &s;hall
mention a few in&s;tances.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t admoni&s;h young and old per&s;ons in
different ways. With re&s;pect to the former, you
may rea&s;onably a&s;&s;ume a con&s;iderable degree of
authority, and urge them, with a &s;ort of &s;everity,
to virtue and improvement. Age claims a re&s;pect
which is &s;carcely con&s;i&s;tent with this in ordinary
ca&s;es, and will be mo&s;t effectually wrought upon by
intreaty, and mild una&s;&s;uming addre&s;&s;es; and
therefore the apo&s;tle him&s;elf directs Timothy not
to &startq;rebuke an elder, but to intreat him as a
&startq;father<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 1.</NOTE>.&endq; You mu&s;t admoni&s;h the poor &s;o as
to &s;hew them that you do not de&s;pi&s;e them for
their poverty, and &s;o as not to give them an
unea&s;y feeling of it; and you mu&s;t endeavour to
comfort them under it, to guard them again&s;t the
dejection, di&s;content, peevi&s;hne&s;s, and di&s;hone&s;ty,
which are apt to ari&s;e from that &s;tate. The rich,
on the other hand, are to be addre&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to
&s;hew that you have no admiration or awe of their
wealth; they are to be warned freely again&s;t the
luxury, pride, and confidence, to which their
<PB N="141" REF="148">
&s;ituation leads, and urged &s;trongly to that gene|ro&s;ity,
beneficence, and alms-giving, for which
their circum&s;tances afford opportunities; and
therefore the apo&s;tle, giving Timothy directions
concerning his behaviour to them, does not &s;ay
<HI>intreat,</HI> but &startq;<HI>charge</HI> them that are rich in this
world, that they be not high-minded<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE>,&endq; &amp;c. It
can never be right to &s;tand in awe of their riches,
or to addre&s;s them in a manner that would &s;eem to
imply this; but it may be often prudent to &s;oothe
them by the &s;oftne&s;s of your exhortations, as David
calmed the evil &s;pirit of Saul by the charms of
mu&s;ic. Some men are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to giddi|ne&s;s,
levity, and thoughtle&s;s mirth; to the&s;e the
language of &s;cripture is, &startq;Wo unto you that
laugh now, for ye &s;hall mourn and weep<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Luke, vi. 25.</NOTE>.&endq;
In conformity to this, a mini&s;ter mu&s;t often pro|po&s;e
to &s;uch the importance, the difficulties, and
the threatenings of religion, that they may be
excited to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. Others are naturally of a
&s;orrowful and melancholy ca&s;t; the plea&s;ures and
the rewards of religion mu&s;t be frequently exhibited
to them, that they may be encouraged in well-doing.
Some are naturally forward and even
impudent, others are mode&s;t and ba&s;hful; the&s;e
mu&s;t be treated in very different ways. The for|mer
can be affected only by &s;evere and peremptory
injunctions; the latter will be touched with the
<PB N="142" REF="149">
milde&s;t in&s;inuations. Some men are of a &s;anguine
and confident temper; others, of a timorous
and diffident turn: the former are to be made &s;en|&s;ible
of their weakne&s;s, that their pre&s;umption may
not precipitate them into &s;in; the latter mu&s;t be
rendered le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of it before they will &s;o much
as attempt their duty. All motives which tend to
depre&s;s the mind are proper for the former; tho&s;e
which rou&s;e and invigorate it, for the latter. In a
word, the patient and impatient, the benevolent
and the envious, the meek and the pa&s;&s;ionate, the
humble and the proud, the re&s;olute and the
wavering, the active and the indolent, the peace|able
and the turbulent, the pro&s;perous and the
afflicted, the ma&s;ter and the &s;ervant, the parent
and the child, the man who &s;ins deliberately and
he who is &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;in by a &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion or
the power of temptation, mu&s;t be all treated in
very different manners. Both the nature of the
admonitions and exhortations which are given,
and the manner in which they are given, mu&s;t
be varied according to every variety of temper and
&s;ituation in per&s;ons. In order to be able thus to
vary them, a mini&s;ter mu&s;t ob&s;erve carefully what
directions each of his people &s;tands mo&s;t in need
of, and how they are wrought upon and affected
in the ordinary concerns of life. Natural prudence
joined with careful experience will enable him by
degrees to give them all &s;uch exhortations as they
&s;tand in need of, in a proper manner. He &s;hould
&s;pare no pains in &s;tudying the diver&s;ity of human
<PB N="143" REF="150">
characters, and the manner of application which
each requires. The be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance that you can
obtain in this, is to attend carefully to the parti|cular
directions which the &s;criptures any where give
to different cla&s;&s;es of people, and to the manner in
which they give them. By the careful &s;tudy of
the&s;e, you will be able to make out for your&s;elves
rules for all the variety of matter and manner that
can be needful in your private exhortations in any
pari&s;h; and if you endeavour to render the rules
which you thus deduce, familiar to your&s;elves, e&s;pe|cially
by writing them down and reading them fre|quently
over, you will not be wholly at a lo&s;s for
executing this part of your duty, even at your
fir&s;t &s;ettlement in a pari&s;h, and a little experience
will enable you to apply them to all particular ca&s;es,
readily and becomingly.</P>
<P>It will be proper to ob&s;erve farther, that though
each peculiarity of character and &s;ituation may
require one manner of addre&s;s as mo&s;t &s;uitable to
it, yet a mini&s;ter &s;hould not con&s;ine him&s;elf en|tirely
to that one manner, but &s;hould imitate the
apo&s;tles, whom we find often &s;oothing, intreating,
be&s;eeching, exhorting, commanding, threatening,
tho&s;e to whom they write, almo&s;t in the &s;ame
breath and on the &s;ame &s;ubject. In like manner,
a mini&s;ter &s;hould try every way with tho&s;e with
whom he conver&s;es, touch as it were every &s;tring,
u&s;e every topic and every manner of addre&s;s, till at
la&s;t he hit on one which &s;hall be effectual. It will
be peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary for a mini&s;ter to try this
<PB N="144" REF="151">
method at fir&s;t, till he become pretty well ac|quainted
with the characters of his pari&s;hioners;
and the making frequent trials in this way will
enable him by degrees to di&s;cover their characters
and the proper way of dealing with them. But
even after he has di&s;covered this, it will be often
very proper to try the &s;ame variety of method;
for men are &s;o capricious, and liable to &s;o many
different humours, that what has great influ|ence
with them at one time, will have none at
another.</P>
<P>It will be of great importance for the right di&s;|charge
of this duty, private exhortation, that a
mini&s;ter obtain from people them&s;elves an account
of their peculiar temper, and of the difficulties
which they meet with in the virtuous conduct of
life. It is no ea&s;y matter to obtain this; for &s;ince
the particular confe&s;&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Popi&s;h
church, and productive of very ill effects, was
laid a&s;ide, Chri&s;tians have run into an oppo&s;ite
extreme, productive of almo&s;t as ill effects. In|&s;tead
of laying open the &s;tate of their &s;ouls to
their mini&s;ters, they endeavour all they can to
conceal it from them; &s;o far are they from
acquainting them with the vices to which they find
them&s;elves expo&s;ed, or the temptations which they
find it difficult to re&s;i&s;t; from telling them, for
in&s;tance, that they find them&s;elves covetous, pa&s;|&s;ionate,
revengeful, envious, or the like; and
from a&s;king their advice concerning the means by
which they may with&s;tand the&s;e vices, and culti|vate
<PB N="145" REF="152">
the oppo&s;ite virtues. In order to avoid the
inconvenience of this, a mini&s;ter &s;hould keep an
eye on the conduct of his pari&s;hioners in ordinary
life, that he may ob&s;erve every opening that he
can find into their characters. He &s;hould likewi&s;e
encourage them in all the ways he can, to lay their
hearts open to him, to con&s;ult him, to a&s;k his
advice in matters of practice. Be&s;ides, when he
is engaged in conver&s;ation with them, if he po&s;&s;e&s;s
the addre&s;s which is nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of
his office (and this addre&s;s it is certainly his duty to
&s;tudy), he will, by a&s;king que&s;tions, and by innu|merable
methods which occa&s;ion will &s;ugge&s;t to
him, di&s;cover their character and &s;ituation, in a
great mea&s;ure whether they will or not. But if a
mini&s;ter be really intent on di&s;covering the varieties
of temper and circum&s;tances among his people,
he will perhaps find that it is owing as much to the
mini&s;ter as to the people, that they are generally &s;o
aver&s;e, or at lea&s;t &s;o carele&s;s in a&s;king the advice of
their pa&s;tor concerning every important &s;tep of
their lives. If he &s;hould find this to be the ca&s;e,
if he &s;hould find them ready to inform him of their
&s;ituation, and to a&s;k his advice, by his giving them
proper encouragement to do it, he will thus obtain
a very great advantage for admoni&s;hing and exhort|ing
them, &s;o as to promote their real improvement
and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the&s;e two duties,
teaching and exhortation &s;eparately, that you
<PB N="146" REF="153">
might the better under&s;tand their nature; but I
repeat, that they are not to be in fact disjoined in
practice; every in&s;truction &s;hould end in exhort|ations
or admonitions; and every exhortation
&s;hould be &s;upported with proper in&s;tructions. The
apo&s;tles command mini&s;ters both to &startq;teach and to
exhort <HI>with all authority.</HI>&endq; A mini&s;ter &s;hould
always behave &s;o as to command the re&s;pect of his
people, and he &s;hould maintain all the authority to
which that entitles him, in his whole intercour&s;e
with them. The exertion of &s;ome degree of this
authority will often be nece&s;&s;ary for keeping tho&s;e
with whom he conver&s;es, from declining the &s;ub|jects
which he choo&s;es to introduce, and running
off to others which better &s;uit their reli&s;h. The
mo&s;t effectual way to &s;upport this authority, &s;o as
to gain attention to a man's private in&s;tructions and
admonitions, is to &s;hew that they proceed from a
warm love to them, and a deep concern for their
eternal intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>I will conclude this &s;ubject with repeating, that
a mini&s;ter &s;hould lay it down as a rule to &s;pend
&s;ome part of every day, except when a good rea|&s;on
prevents it, in giving private in&s;tructions and
exhortations in this manner to &s;ome or other of
his people, as he can meet with them. It will
really be very little labour to him; it will rather
be a plea&s;ure, if he be fired with the true &s;pirit of
his calling, and find his people docile and tract|able,
which if they &s;hould not be at fir&s;t, this
<PB N="147" REF="154">
method will probably very &s;oon render them. But
if any man think the &s;pending a part of mo&s;t days
in this manner an in&s;upportable drudgery, let him
recollect that the end of the mini&s;try is to render
men fit for heaven; let him judge whether all that
we have pre&s;cribed be more than &s;ufficient for the
attainment of this end. If he think it is, he has
never con&s;idered the difficulty and importance of
the end; and if he be not willing for the &s;ake of it
to take all the trouble that we have mentioned, he
is not, till he change his &s;entiments, capable of
fulfilling the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel, &s;o as to &s;ave
either him&s;elf or others.</P>

<P>ANOTHER private duty of the pa&s;toral office,
which may indeed be regarded as a branch of the
former, but is at the &s;ame time &s;o peculiar in its
nature as to de&s;erve a &s;eparate illu&s;tration, is coun|&s;elling,
or giving people advice in ca&s;es of con|&s;cience,
which they may propo&s;e to their mini&s;ter.
We have the example of the apo&s;tles for this duty,
particularly of the apo&s;tle Paul, with re&s;pect to di&s;|tinctions
of meats and days<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv.</NOTE>, and with re&s;pect to mar|riage<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vii.</NOTE>&endq;.
<PB N="148" REF="155">
We &s;hall content our&s;elves with making a
very few ob&s;ervations on it, &s;uch chiefly as may
prevent the abu&s;es of it.</P>
<P>When con&s;cience or the moral faculty is exer|ci&s;ed
about a man's own actions and temper, it
makes him &s;olicitous to know beforehand how he
may act aright in particular circum&s;tances, and
anxious afterwards to di&s;cover whether he has
acted right; whether he ought to approve or con|demn
him&s;elf, and what judgment he may ju&s;tly
form concerning the general temper and &s;tate of
his &s;oul. The repre&s;entation of the circum&s;tances
on which this deci&s;ion depends, is termed a ca&s;e of
con&s;cience; a ca&s;e in which a man wants to have
his con&s;cience informed and directed. To coun&s;el,
is to give &s;afe and &s;ea&s;onable advice in &s;uch a ca&s;e,
to deal aright with men's con&s;ciences as to the
guilt of their &s;ins. Before the Reformation, there
was a court for this very purpo&s;e, called the Peni|tential
court, as well as another, the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
court, for judicial ca&s;es. The latter had for its
object public offences, and for its end the enjoin|ing
of public penances for the &s;atisfaction of the
church, and had rules adapted to the&s;e; the former
regarded &s;uch ca&s;es as were not public, aimed at
the private direction of penitents, and had rules
different from tho&s;e of the other court, and adapted
<PB N="149" REF="156">
to the peculiarity of its own object and end, but
chiefly calculated for proportioning the kind and
degree of private penances to the nature of
offences, the circum&s;tances of per&s;ons and actions,
and the mea&s;ure of contrition. In the reformed
churches, &s;uch courts are with good rea&s;on abo|li&s;hed;
and in ours, any formal ab&s;olution by the
mini&s;ter is in &s;uch ca&s;es di&s;charged. But for every
mini&s;ter it is nece&s;&s;ary to be able to &s;ettle doubting
con&s;ciences, to compo&s;e the troubled, and to put
men into the be&s;t method of repenting, and avoid|ing
&s;in for the future<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, vol. i. c. 3. p. 211.</NOTE>. Ca&s;es of con&s;cience may
be reduced to two general cla&s;&s;es; &s;uch as regard
a man's conduct in a particular in&s;tance, and
&s;uch as regard the general &s;tate of a man's &s;oul.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a man's con&s;cience may be at a lo&s;s to
determine, what ought to be his conduct in &s;ome
particular &s;ituation, or to decide upon reflection,
whether he has acted right in that &s;ituation.
There is often real occa&s;ion for doubts on this
&s;ubject: for it is ob&s;ervable, that ju&s;tice is almo&s;t
the only virtue which admits of ab&s;olutely preci&s;e
and accurate rules. The rules of almo&s;t all the
re&s;t are much more loo&s;e and indeterminate; they
admit of many exceptions, and require a variety
of modifications, almo&s;t as numerous as the cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="150" REF="157">
in which they are to be reduced to
practice. The former are therefore compared,
by an ingenious author, to the rules of grammar,
which are determinate, and may be learned &s;o as
to be infallibly ob&s;erved in every ca&s;e; the latter,
to tho&s;e rules which critics lay down for the attain|ment
of what is &s;ublime and elegant in compo|&s;ition,
and which pre&s;ent us rather with a general
idea of the perfection we ought to aim at, than
afford us any certain and infallible directions for
acquiring it. A per&s;on therefore hone&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed
to do his duty, may often be at a lo&s;s to know
what piety, genero&s;ity, friend&s;hip, gratitude, re|quires
of him in a particular &s;ituation. The diffi|culty
is increa&s;ed by this circum&s;tance, that
written laws, whether divine or human, mu&s;t be
expre&s;&s;ed in general terms, and the application of
them to particular ca&s;es mu&s;t be left to men them|&s;elves.
There is perhaps no virtue except ju&s;tice,
which admits of more preci&s;e rules than gratitude;
yet a very little reflection will make the difficulty
that we have hinted at, obvious. If a benefactor,
&s;uppo&s;e, attended you in your &s;ickne&s;s, ought you
to attend him in his? or can you fulfil the obliga|tion
of gratitude, by making a return of a different
kind? If you ought to attend him, how long
ought you to attend him? The &s;ame time that he
attended you, or longer, and how much longer?
If your friend lent you money in your di&s;tre&s;s,
ought you to lend him money in his? How
much ought you to lend him? When ought you
<PB N="151" REF="158">
to lend it to him? and for how long a time? It is
evident that no general rule can be laid down, by
which a preci&s;e an&s;wer can, in all ca&s;es, be given
to any of the&s;e que&s;tions. The difference between
his character and yours, between his circum&s;tances
and yours, may be &s;uch, that you may be perfectly
grateful, and yet ju&s;tly refu&s;e to lend him any
thing; and on the contrary, you may be willing
to lend, or even to give him ten times the &s;um
which he lent you, and yet ju&s;tly be accu&s;ed of
the blacke&s;t ingratitude, and of not having fulfilled
the hundredth part of the obligation you lie under.
This want of preci&s;ion in the rules of mo&s;t moral
and chri&s;tian virtues has di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons of tender
con&s;ciences to de&s;ire determinate directions for
their conduct in particular in&s;tances, and has di&s;|po&s;ed
others to turn ca&s;ui&s;try into a &s;cience for their
direction. The cultivation of this &s;cience was
greatly promoted in the middle and latter ages of
the church, by the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of auricular
confe&s;&s;ion. By that in&s;titution the mo&s;t &s;ecret
actions, and even the thoughts of every per&s;on,
which could be &s;u&s;pected of receding, in the &s;malle&s;t
degree, from the rules of chri&s;tian purity and
virtue, were to be revealed to the confe&s;&s;or. The
confe&s;&s;or informed his penitents, whether, and in
what re&s;pect they had violated their duty, and
what pennance it behoved them to undergo,
before he could ab&s;olve them in the name of the
offended Deity. To be qualified to be a confe&s;&s;or,
was a nece&s;&s;ary part of the &s;tudy of divines; and
<PB N="152" REF="159">
they were thence led to collect ca&s;es of nice and
delicate &s;ituations, in which it is hard to determine
how to act. Such collections they thought might
be of u&s;e, both to the directors of con&s;ciences, and
to tho&s;e who were to be directed.</P>
<P>It happened, however, as might have been ex|pected,
that the want of preci&s;ion in the rules for
the exerci&s;e of mo&s;t virtues in particular &s;ituations,
which &s;eemed to render ca&s;ui&s;try nece&s;&s;ary, ren|dered
it at the &s;ame time imperfect, and in a great
mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s; for it made it impo&s;&s;ible to lay
down exact and preci&s;e rules for the direction of
every circum&s;tance of men's behaviour. It was
hinted before, that one virtue, ju&s;tice, admits of
very exact rules. The&s;e are &s;ubject to no excep|tions
or modifications, but &s;uch as may be a&s;cer|tained
as accurately as the rules them&s;elves, and
generally indeed $low from the very &s;ame prin|ciples.
What we ought in &s;trict ju&s;tice to per|form,
how much we ought to perform, when
and where we ought to perform it, the whole
nature and circum&s;tances of the action pre&s;cribed,
are all preci&s;ely fixed and determined. Accord|ingly,
the whole of juri&s;prudence is employed
in determining the particular laws of ju&s;tice;
and as long as we keep to the preci&s;e prin|ciples
and views of juri&s;prudence, it is ea&s;y to de|termine
them with ab&s;olute certainty and perfect
exactne&s;s. The principles of juri&s;prudence lead a
per&s;on to con&s;ider, only what the man to whom the
<PB N="153" REF="160">
obligation is due ought to think him&s;elf entitled
to exact by force, what every impartial &s;pectator
would approve of him for exacting, what a judge
or arbiter, to whom he had &s;ubmitted his cau&s;e,
and who had undertaken to do him ju&s;tice, ought
to oblige the other per&s;on to &s;uffer or to perform.
But even with re&s;pect to ju&s;tice, ca&s;ui&s;try does
not give &s;o clear deci&s;ions; it is not its aim to
teach a man how he mu&s;t act &s;o as to avoid de&s;erv|ing
external puni&s;hment, but how he mu&s;t act &s;o
as to be a good man, and to de&s;erve prai&s;e by his
exact and &s;crupulous behaviour. Ca&s;ui&s;ts do not
con&s;ider &s;o much what it is that might properly be
exacted by force, as what it is that the per&s;on who
owes the obligation ought to think him&s;elf bound
to perform from the mo&s;t &s;acred and &s;crupulous
regard to the general rules of ju&s;tice, and from the
mo&s;t con&s;cientious dread, either of wronging his
neighbour, or of violating the integrity of his own
character. To decide matters of conduct in this
point of view is of much greater delicacy, and the
deci&s;ion mu&s;t be more indeterminate. An in&s;tance
that is very commonly debated will illu&s;trate this.
A highwayman, by the fear of death, obliges a tra|veller
to promi&s;e him a &s;um of money. Is &s;uch a
promi&s;e, extorted in this manner by unju&s;t force,
to be regarded as obligatory? Con&s;ider it merely
as a que&s;tion of juri&s;prudence, the deci&s;ion can
admit of no doubt. It would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e
that the highwayman can be entitled to u&s;e force
to con&s;train the other to perform. To extort the
<PB N="154" REF="161">
promi&s;e was a crime that de&s;erved &s;evere puni&s;h|ment;
and to extort the performance of it would
only be adding a new crime to the former. To
&s;uppo&s;e that a judge ought to enforce the obliga|tion
of &s;uch promi&s;es, or that a magi&s;trate ought to
allow them to &s;u&s;tain action at law, would be the
mo&s;t ridiculous of all ab&s;urdities. But if we con|&s;ider
it as a que&s;tion of ca&s;ui&s;try, as a ca&s;e of con|&s;cience
in which a good man wants direction, it will
not be &s;o ea&s;ily determined. Whether a man does
not owe &s;ome regard even to a promi&s;e thus
unju&s;tly extorted, from a re&s;pect to his own dig|nity
and honour, from abhorrence of all treachery
and fal&s;ehood, may very readily be made a que&s;tion,
and has divided the opinions of ca&s;ui&s;ts. Accord|ing
to the &s;entiments of good men, &s;ome regard is
due to &s;uch a promi&s;e: but it is impo&s;&s;ible to
determine how much, by any general rule that will
apply to all ca&s;es without exception. If the deci|&s;ions
of ca&s;ui&s;ts, even concerning ca&s;es of ju&s;tice,
are thus nece&s;&s;arily indeterminate, they mu&s;t be
much more &s;o with re&s;pect to other virtues, which,
from their very nature, &s;carcely admit of any pre|ci&s;e
and accurate rules. But though this circum|&s;tance
renders ca&s;ui&s;try, when formed into a &s;cience,
and reduced to a &s;y&s;tem, in a great mea&s;ure preca|rious
and u&s;ele&s;s, yet &s;till it would be of great u&s;e
that people con&s;ulted their mini&s;ter in all points of
conduct that are of importance. They could
repre&s;ent to him the pre&s;ent ca&s;e in all its circum|&s;tances;
and however difficult it is to form a
<PB N="155" REF="162">
general rule of conduct, yet it is ea&s;y to give particu|lar
directions for one ca&s;e. Though the deci&s;ions of
ca&s;ui&s;ts were ju&s;t, weak people could gain little ad|vantage
by con&s;ulting them, becau&s;e though multi|tudes
of ca&s;es are collected in them, yet there is an
infinite variety of po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances, and it is a
chance if one be found exactly parallel to the pre&s;ent.
But a mini&s;ter of prudence and virtue may give
them always a deci&s;ion preci&s;ely &s;uited to the pre|&s;ent
ca&s;e, and can vary it according to every the
minute&s;t variety of &s;ituation; and thus accommo|date
it even to tho&s;e virtues which admit lea&s;t of
preci&s;e and accurate general rules.</P>
<P>When a mini&s;ter is con&s;ulted beforehand, he
&s;hould mo&s;t carefully avoid whatever can have the
remote&s;t tendency to teach men to chicane with
their own con&s;ciences, or to authori&s;e by vain
&s;ubtleties innumerable eva&s;ive refinements with
regard to the &s;everal articles of duty. In fact,
this is the end to which ca&s;ui&s;try has been often
applied, not to direct the well-meaning to real
virtue, but to enable the di&s;hone&s;t to explain away
their duty. He &s;hould make it his aim, not to
inform men of the lowe&s;t degree of virtue that
they may take up with, but to animate them to
what is &s;ublime and noble in goodne&s;s. He
&s;hould not attempt to determine with a frivolous
accuracy, but endeavour to excite commanding
emotions, and to infu&s;e a &s;trong &s;pirit of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="163">
But, as the world goes, a mini&s;ter cannot expect
to be often con&s;ulted by his pari&s;hioners, how they
ought to act in particular ca&s;es which are yet
before them. Men are not very ready even to
examine their own conduct before they act, much
le&s;s to con&s;ult another about it. It is at that time
of greate&s;t importance, that we &s;hould have ju&s;t
views of our actions; but pa&s;&s;ion &s;eldom allows
us then to con&s;ider what we are doing, candidly
and impartially. It is when the action is over,
when the pa&s;&s;ions which prompted to it have &s;ub|&s;ided,
that men begin candidly to con&s;ider their
conduct. Then they often reflect on their viola|tion
of the laws of virtue, with remor&s;e, dread,
and terror: and &s;ometimes the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
having done wrong is &s;uch a load upon their minds,
that they are $ager to di&s;burden them&s;elves to their
mini&s;ter, and to know his opinion concerning that
conduct which fills them with &s;evere compunction.
In this ca&s;e a mini&s;ter ought to repre&s;ent their pa&s;t
conduct to them in its true light, without either
exaggerating or extenuating it. The former
would only either irritate them to defend it, or
fink them into de&s;pair; and the latter would favour
the partial views of it, which they are too apt to
entertain of their own accord. It &s;hould be his
chief bu&s;ine&s;s to prevent their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
guilt from producing vain regret, and to in&s;til
&s;uch principles and re&s;olutions as may &s;ecure them
from the like errors for the future. When they
<PB N="157" REF="164">
feel keen remor&s;e for &s;ome heinous &s;in which they
have committed, it mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed by the
mini&s;ter till it produce thorough repentance pro|portioned
to the crime, and &s;o directed that it may
mo&s;t effectually produce this. If their remor&s;e be
in danger of degenerating into de&s;pair, it is his
bu&s;ine&s;s, without di&s;gui&s;ing the real heinou&s;ne&s;s of
their &s;in, to inculcate the a&s;&s;urance which, not|with&s;tanding
that, they have of pardon on their
amendment.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind of ca&s;es of con&s;cience are tho&s;e
which regard the general &s;tate of men's &s;ouls. It
is natural that men &s;hould be &s;olicitous to obtain
&s;ome degree of certainty, whether they be in a
&s;tate of grace and reconciliation with God or not.
But it is not always ea&s;y, either for them&s;elves or
others, to determine this. Though &s;ome men
may, on account of the great uniformity of their
holine&s;s, obtain a con&s;iderable degree of <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI>
yet mo&s;t men, by rea&s;on of the incon&s;tancy of
their good conduct, of the frequent repetition of
&s;ins which they have re&s;olved to for&s;ake, and of
other cau&s;es, can entertain only different degrees of
<HI>hope,</HI> and ought not to be encouraged to more.
There are &s;everal circum&s;tances which increa&s;e
the difficulty of dealing with per&s;ons who propo&s;e
ca&s;es of this kind. We &s;hall mention a few of
the&s;e, and make &s;ome general ob&s;ervations on the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="165">
The doubts of men concerning their &s;tate are
generally very much heightened by a &s;y&s;tem of
principles, exaggerated beyond the truth, with
which they are all connected, and on which they
depend. Some of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them
are the&s;e. They carry the doctrine of original &s;in
&s;o far, as to imagine that all men are, for many
years of their lives, in a &s;tate of damnation, and
wholly de&s;titute of all grace; they think that this
&s;tate continues, till they be at a certain period in
a &s;en&s;ible manner converted; by &s;training &s;ome
&s;cripture metaphors, they repre&s;ent conver&s;ion to
them&s;elves as attended with violent inward pang$,
and terrors of con&s;iderable duration; they judge of
the &s;incerity of their conver&s;ion and regeneration
by the violence of the&s;e, more than by the general
tenor of their temper and conduct; when the&s;e
wear off, they are either filled with joy in the con|fidence
of their being already regenerated, or el&s;e
plunged in doubts whether they do not &s;till con|tinue
in a &s;tate of nature. It is nece&s;&s;ary that a
mini&s;ter know perfectly the &s;et of principles with
which a per&s;on's doubts are connected, before he
can argue with him; and that he do not attempt
directly to call them in que&s;tion, even though he
&s;hould not be &s;atisfied of their truth, but rather
rea&s;on upon them as much as he can. His chief
bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be, in&s;en&s;ibly to correct the extravagancies
of the&s;e principles, to direct men not to
judge by their inward pangs and &s;orrows, which
<PB N="159" REF="166">
are fallacious marks; to turn their attention to
their habitual conduct and temper, as the only
&s;ure criterion. When he finds that their per|plexity
ari&s;es from their wanting to find in them|&s;elves
&s;ome my&s;terious marks of grace, it &s;hould be
his bu&s;ine&s;s to inculcate on them, that chri&s;tian and
moral virtues are both the only genuine fruits, and
the only infallible marks of grace. By bringing
men to e&s;timate their &s;tate by this criterion, he will
render the trial much le&s;s liable to ambiguity. It
is likewi&s;e of importance that a mini&s;ter, in ca&s;es
of this kind, endeavour to give men right notions
of conver&s;ion; for from wrong conceptions of it,
many of their perplexities ari&s;e. In con&s;equence of
their exaggerations of the &s;et of principles before|mentioned,
they con&s;ider regeneration as if it were
a line, on the one &s;ide of which lies a &s;tate of
damnation, but cro&s;&s;ing it in a moment as it were,
they are immediately in a &s;tate of grace and &s;alva|tion,
from which they can never fall. Regene|ration
mu&s;t therefore be repre&s;ented to them as a
work that is not accompli&s;hed all at once, but
carried on by &s;low degrees; &s;o that it may be
begun where it is yet very imperfect, and mu&s;t be
completed by &s;trenuous diligence and the uniform
practice of holine&s;s. It mu&s;t be urged, that they
can never be &s;ure of their conver&s;ion, till it has
produced this effect; but that every degree of this
effect is a &s;ufficient ground of hope that it is begun.
It is only by &s;uch a repre&s;entation of things, that
they can be guarded, on the one hand, again&s;t
<PB N="160" REF="167">
de&s;pair, from thinking them&s;elves wholly in a
&s;tate of nature; or, on the other hand, again&s;t
&s;ecurity or pre&s;umption, from imagining that they
are all at once tran&s;lated into that &s;tate of grace,
from which they are in no danger of apo&s;tatizing.
It would be endle&s;s to mention all the difficulties
which ari&s;e from the perver&s;ion of different prin|ciples
of religion, or all the varieties which, from
this perver&s;ion, occur in the ca&s;es which will be
propo&s;ed to mini&s;ters. Prudence and reflection,
joined with experience, will be the be&s;t help for
the&s;e.</P>
<P>It was already hinted, that one will not receive
a great deal of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the writings of
ca&s;ui&s;ts, for the di&s;charge of this duty. But &s;till
he may receive &s;ome. He will however receive
greatly more from a thorough knowlege of the
&s;criptures, from a di&s;tinct comprehen&s;ion of the
terms of the go&s;pel covenant, from an exten&s;ive
view and a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the mea&s;ures of conduct
and the propriety of behaviour.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t mention one circum&s;tance, which
greatly increa&s;es the difficulty of this part of a
mini&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s. It is this, that doubts or fears
are often joined with bodily di&s;temper, with melan|choly.
When this is the ca&s;e, a doubt about the
nature of one action, &s;ometimes comes to coincide
with a doubt about one's general &s;tate, as in the
in&s;tance which is very common among melancholy
<PB N="161" REF="168">
per&s;ons; their &s;u&s;pecting that they have been
guilty of the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and
therefore incapable of forgivene&s;s. When per&s;ons
are &s;ubject to a melancholy habit, it is not ea&s;y to
talk to them in any way that will have any good
effect. I have been &s;ometimes di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect,
that it would be be&s;t not to talk with them on
religious &s;ubjects at all: for their di&s;temper makes
them mi&s;under&s;tand every thing that is &s;aid, and
wre&s;t even what is mo&s;t comfortable to a &s;en&s;e
unfavourable to them&s;elves. Imagination is &s;o
&s;trong in that di&s;ea&s;e, that they will be often fully
convinced that a man has &s;aid ju&s;t the rever&s;e of
what he has &s;aid, and that the mo&s;t harmle&s;s things
were intended as a plain hint to them that they are
in a hopele&s;s &s;tate. There is nothing from which
they will not take a handle to feed their di&s;temper,
and &s;upport their apprehen&s;ions. By this means, a
mini&s;ter may increa&s;e their di&s;order, while he is
mo&s;t de&s;irous to allay it. But, on the whole, I am
inclined to the contrary opinion, that a mini&s;ter
may, not often indeed, but when either the di&s;|ordered
per&s;ons, or even tho&s;e about them, expre&s;s
a &s;olicitude for it, conver&s;e with them with &s;ome
benefit. From his declining it, they might take
occa&s;ion to draw conclu&s;ions more to their own
di&s;advantage, than they could draw from any
thing he would &s;ay; as, that he thought them
unworthy of in&s;truction or advice, that he knew
their &s;tate to be hopele&s;s, or the like. Though
they will very probably wre&s;t all that he &s;ays into
<PB N="162" REF="169">
a &s;en&s;e unfavourable to them&s;elves, &s;till this is no
wor&s;e than would happen, though he ab&s;tained
from conver&s;ing with them; for the &s;ame turn of
imagination will lead them to run into &s;imilar
conclu&s;ions from their own thoughts, or from
the mo&s;t indifferent conver&s;ation. As there is
always &s;ome mi&s;taken notion or another which
breeds them unea&s;ine&s;s, a mini&s;ter &s;hould endea|vour
to rectify it. This will very probably have
little or no influence on them at the time; but it
may give them a handle for rectifying their own
notions, when their di&s;ea&s;e begins to wear off.
The talking with them on this &s;ubject may &s;eem
to have a tendency to feed their di&s;temper; but
there is really a nece&s;&s;ity for humouring it in &s;ome
degree; and the ea&s;e which they receive from
giving it &s;ome vent at times, contributes more to
wear it off, than keeping it always under re&s;traint.
At the &s;ame time, a mini&s;ter ought to endeavour
to draw them off in&s;en&s;ibly from tho&s;e &s;ubjects
which di&s;tre&s;s and terrify them, to others more
indifferent. It will not be ea&s;y to do this; for
a melancholy imagination has a great degree of
ob&s;tinacy in adhering to the &s;ubjects which give
it unea&s;ine&s;s, and even per&s;i&s;ts in believing things
that never had an exi&s;tence, and in per&s;uading
a per&s;on that he has been guilty of crimes which
he never once thought of. It may, however, be
in &s;ome degree effected, by &s;howing great &s;ym|pathy
with them, by humouring their caprices a
little, and by other prudent methods. But when
<PB N="163" REF="170">
per&s;ons are in this di&s;order, which ari&s;es chiefly
from the body, it is above all of importance, that
they be kept from being much alone, that they be
diverted from thinking, and that they be prevailed
upon to take moderate exerci&s;e. A mini&s;ter may
be of u&s;e to them, by directing tho&s;e about them
to put them upon the&s;e: and by his authority with
them from his character, and the influence which
he may gain over them by in&s;inuating conver&s;ation,
a mini&s;ter may often be more &s;ucce&s;sful in per&s;uad|ing
them to u&s;e the&s;e means of re&s;toring their
health, than others could be.</P>
<P>To be often thus employed in directing the
conduct of others in difficult emergencies, in
teaching them what judgment they ought to form
of their pa&s;t behaviour and their &s;tate, in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
needle&s;s &s;cruples from con&s;cientious care,
in &s;tripping off fal&s;e di&s;gui&s;es from what is really
evil, has a plain tendency to di&s;po&s;e a mini&s;ter
him&s;elf to act with a con&s;tant regard to the rules
of duty, to live correctly, and frequently to
review and examine his own temper and actions.</P>

<P>THE con&s;ideration of that one kind of di&s;temper
ju&s;t mentioned, naturally leads us to another duty
<PB N="164" REF="171">
of the pa&s;toral care, Vi&s;iting the afflicted, par|ticularly
the &s;ick. Nature it&s;elf prompts all men
&s;o &s;trongly to this, as might of it&s;elf convince us
that it is peculiarly the duty of a mini&s;ter. But
the &s;cripture likewi&s;e expre&s;sly makes it a part of
his duty, and directs Chri&s;tians to call for him in
this &s;ituation. &startq;Is any &s;ick among you?&endq; &s;ays
the apo&s;tle James, &startq;let him call for the elders of
the church, and let them pray over him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">James, v. 14.</NOTE>.&endq;
It is a duty of common humanity to &s;ympathize
with per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s, and to give them all the
relief which our pre&s;ence and the expre&s;&s;ion of our
&s;ympathy can give; a mini&s;ter may likewi&s;e give
them &s;till more important relief by his in&s;tructions
and advices. Not only &s;ickne&s;s, but every kind of
affliction, temporal lo&s;&s;es, or the death of relations,
is an occa&s;ion which merits the pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of a mini&s;ter. Adver&s;ity of every kind
demands both &s;ympathy and con&s;olation; and to
&startq;weep with tho&s;e who weep,&endq; and to comfort
them if po&s;&s;ible, is a noble employment. Pro|&s;perity
has a natural tendency to produce thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
and an unfeeling temper of mind, which
render men indi&s;po&s;ed for receiving good impre&s;|&s;ions.
Adver&s;ity tends to correct this &s;tubborn|ne&s;s,
to render the heart &s;oft and pliable, to di&s;po&s;e
it to &s;erious and u&s;eful reflections, and to fit it for
receiving a deep impre&s;&s;ion from religious in&s;truc|tions
<PB N="165" REF="172">
and exhortations. A mini&s;ter &s;hould there|fore
regard the time of adver&s;ity as a favourable
opportunity, which he &s;hould not &s;ail to &s;eize, of
doing &s;ome good to tho&s;e on whom all he could
&s;ay formerly had very little influence. He may
employ this opportunity in giving them any u&s;eful
in&s;tructions, relating to the whole of their chri&s;tian
duty; for they will then be more inclined to li&s;ten
to them, and to be &s;uitably affected with them, than
at other times. But it is more peculiarly proper
to &s;how that all afflictions are appointed by the
powerful, wi&s;e, and good providence of God, and
that none of them can po&s;&s;ibly befal any man
without his permi&s;&s;ion; to explain the wi&s;e ends
for which they are appointed, and the u&s;eful pur|po&s;es
to which men may render them &s;ub&s;ervient
to them&s;elves. The&s;e are trite topics; it is taken
for granted that all men are acquainted with them,
and all imagine that they believe them. But it is
plain that they do not produce tho&s;e effects upon
the temper of men, which they are naturally fitted
to produce; and therefore a mini&s;ter &s;hould incul|cate
them in &s;uch a way as is fitte&s;t to make them
touch the heart. Adver&s;ity of every kind contains
temptations to &s;ome particular vices; a mini&s;ter
&s;hould make it a great part of his bu&s;ine&s;s, in con|ver&s;ing
with the afflicted, to guard them again&s;t
the&s;e vices, again&s;t di&s;content, repining, impa|tience,
peevi&s;hne&s;s. Adver&s;ity demands &s;ome
duties in a peculiar manner, and either di&s;po&s;es to,
or gives opportunity for, the exertion of &s;everal
<PB N="166" REF="173">
virtues; it is the natural &s;ea&s;on of con&s;ideration,
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, prayer, &s;elf-examination, patience,
re&s;ignation. To the&s;e a mini&s;ter &s;hould particu|larly
exhort and excite tho&s;e afflicted per&s;ons whom
he vi&s;its. It mu&s;t however be remarked, that
though it is the duty of a mini&s;ter to inculcate
the&s;e things as much as po&s;&s;ible, yet great prudence
is often nece&s;&s;ary in the manner of introducing
them. When an affliction is of &s;uch a nature as
to occa&s;ion violent &s;orrow or great di&s;quiet of
mind, this mu&s;t be in &s;ome degree abated, before
men are capable of li&s;tening to any thing. The
weakne&s;s of nature &s;eems to require &s;ome vent for
the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of violent pa&s;&s;ions; but its
demand is much increa&s;ed by this circum&s;tance,
that the generality of men never think of re&s;training
any pa&s;&s;ion, but accu&s;tom them&s;elves to indulge
the pre&s;ent impul&s;e or inclination, e&s;pecially when
it is &s;trong and vehement. On this account, when
a mini&s;ter has frequent and ready acce&s;s to afflicted
per&s;ons, it will often be be&s;t at fir&s;t to allow them
to give &s;cope to their unea&s;ine&s;s, only gently check|ing
&s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of it as are quite extravagant,
highly indecent, or plainly &s;inful; and afterwards,
as they become more compo&s;ed, to in&s;inuate gradu|ally
u&s;eful in&s;tructions and religious reflections,
which may both contribute to compo&s;e them more,
and, by taking fa&s;t hold of their minds in their
pre&s;ent pliable temper, remain with them, and
actuate their future conduct. But he mu&s;t &s;till
take care, before that &s;oftne&s;s and docility of mind
<PB N="167" REF="174">
which &s;prings from affliction be worn off, or con|&s;iderably
abated, to propo&s;e to them, in the
&s;tronge&s;t manner, all the in&s;tructions which he
thinks they &s;tand in need of, and will now receive
with greater advantage than at another time. If a
mini&s;ter will perform this part of his duty, he mu&s;t
generally do it without being a&s;ked; for it is not
entirely cu&s;tomary to &s;end for a mini&s;ter on &s;uch
occa&s;ions: but, by going of his own accord, he
may furni&s;h his people with u&s;eful materials for
meditation in the time of their di&s;tre&s;s, which may
likewi&s;e exert them&s;elves in directing their whole
future conduct.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the only &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s in which
the generality think of de&s;iring the pre&s;ence or
advice of their mini&s;ter, is &s;ickne&s;s; and then too,
they are often very late of de&s;iring it. They &s;ome|times
defer it till they have lo&s;t all hopes of reco|very,
and then &s;end for him, either to fit them for
heaven, as it were, by a charm, or to &s;ee if he can
allay the terrors which have &s;eized upon them in
the pro&s;pect of death. It is, at any rate, a difficult
work to deal with tho&s;e who are ju&s;t &s;tepping into
eternity; but when this circum&s;tance attends it, it
renders it much more difficult. In order to pre|vent
it, a mini&s;ter &s;hould not &s;tay till he be &s;ent
for; but as &s;oon as he hears that any in his pari&s;h
are &s;ick, he &s;hould immediately go to them of his
own accord. By this means, he will have an
opportunity of examining and exhorting them,
<PB N="168" REF="175">
while they are yet capable of &s;ome compo&s;ure of
thought, and have &s;ome time before them; and
he will contribute to wear out an opinion which
&s;eems to be too prevalent, that they need only a
prayer from a mini&s;ter in their la&s;t moments. By
this means too, he will mo&s;t effectually con&s;ult his
own ea&s;e; for by vi&s;iting the &s;ick when he can
render it convenient for him, he will in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
prevent his being &s;ent for when it is le&s;s con|venient.</P>
<P>In other churches, there is a particular office
for this duty pre&s;cribed by authority; but even
this does not exhau&s;t the duty. &startq;To run over
&s;ome prayers, and to take leave,&endq; is ea&s;y, but
comes not up to the de&s;ign of the&s;e churches in
pre&s;cribing it; and the form it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es parti|cular
and &s;uitable addre&s;&s;es by the mini&s;ter him&s;elf.
In all the&s;e addre&s;&s;es he &s;hould apply him&s;elf parti|cularly
to the &s;tate and condition of the per&s;on
whom he vi&s;its.</P>
<P>In every thing that a mini&s;ter &s;ays to a &s;ick per|&s;on,
he ought to keep three things &s;teadily in view;
the influence which it may have on the per&s;on, if
dying; the influence which it may have on him,
if he &s;hould recover; and the influence which it
may have upon per&s;ons in health, who are about
him. Every thing that can have a bad influence
in any of the&s;e ways, mu&s;t be carefully avoided.
A mini&s;ter mu&s;t guard the per&s;on him&s;elf again&s;t
<PB N="169" REF="176">
ill-grounded hopes of mercy on the one hand, and
again&s;t de&s;pair on the other; he mu&s;t avoid giving
him any notions that could tempt him to carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s
and &s;ecurity, if he &s;hould recover, or encou|rage
him to tru&s;t again to a death-bed repentance;
and he mu&s;t be anxiou&s;ly on his guard again&s;t
dropping any thing that can lead &s;pectators in the
lea&s;t to flatter them&s;elves, that after having &s;pent
their life in &s;in, they may &s;et all to rights by a few
tears, or confe&s;&s;ions, or prayers, in their la&s;t hours.
Any man will very often find it difficult to guard
his thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions &s;o as to avoid all
the&s;e hazards; and therefore every one &s;hould
employ the mo&s;t inten&s;e and deliberate meditation
about it.</P>
<P>There are many &s;ubjects on which a mini&s;ter
may properly in&s;i&s;t in all his exhortations to &s;ick
or dying per&s;ons. He &s;hould inculcate on them,
that di&s;ea&s;es are ordered, not by chance, but by
Divine Providence, either for puni&s;hment, for
correction, or for our exerci&s;e in virtue; and in
con&s;equence of this, encourage them to patience,
per&s;uade them to re&s;ignation, exhort them to
examine their conduct, and to re&s;olve to amend
what has been faulty in it. He &s;hould in&s;truct
them in the nature of death, and in&s;till into them
tho&s;e &s;entiments of the vanity of pre&s;ent things, of
the folly of anxiety about them, of immoderate love
to them, of endle&s;s endeavours or unlawful
methods to procure them, of abu&s;ing them to bad
<PB N="170" REF="177">
purpo&s;es, of &s;inking our&s;elves in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures,
which obviou&s;ly ari&s;e from the con&s;ideration of the
nature of death, and which, if he can thoroughly
in&s;till them, will enable them either to leave the&s;e
things without regret if they &s;hould happen to
die, or to live above them if they &s;hould recover.
He &s;hould lead their view to the important con&s;e|quences
of death, as it is our entrance into an
eternal world; that when they have now a near
pro&s;pect of it, they may be more &s;en&s;ibly &s;truck
with the &s;olemnity of judgment, with the glories
of heaven, and with the terrors of hell, and feel
all their power. He &s;hould in&s;truct them in that
preparation which it will appear, from the view of
its nature, that death requires; an habitual &s;upe|riority
to things external, di&s;engagement from the
body and from &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, and &s;uch a con|duct
as naturally &s;prings from a firm faith in the
un&s;een world. He &s;hould al&s;o explain to them
fully, and illu&s;trate with &s;orce, the nature of the
go&s;pel covenant; the ble&s;&s;ings which God on his
part propo&s;es to us, both tho&s;e which he has
be&s;towed on us in this life as privileges which we
ought to improve, and by which we ought to be
excited to the practice of every chri&s;tian virtue,
and tho&s;e which he promi&s;es in the future world
as the reward of chri&s;tian obedience, and the im|provement
of grace already received; and like|wi&s;e
the terms which God requires from us on our
part. As it is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to pre|&s;erve
a full view of the&s;e through the whole of life,
<PB N="171" REF="178">
&s;o it is of particular importance that per&s;ons have
a full and lively &s;en&s;e of them in the pro&s;pect of
death, as they alone can direct their judgment
concerning them&s;elves, and be a foundation either
of &s;uch hopes as may comfort and encourage them,
or of &s;uch fears as may rou&s;e them to do all that is
yet po&s;&s;ible for their &s;ouls. If &s;ick per&s;ons di&s;|cover
any thing which perplexes their minds, or
any ca&s;es in which they want to be re&s;olved, a
mini&s;ter ought to give them his coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
hone&s;tly; but he ought to avoid giving a
po&s;itive determination about the final &s;tate of their
&s;ouls: as he cannot know the heart, he &s;hould
content him&s;elf with calling upon them to fini&s;h
their duty, to do all the good they can in the time
that remains, and to pray for pardon and accept|ance,
and with explaining the terms of &s;alvation,
&s;o as to give them the principles on which they
them&s;elves may, from a careful and con&s;cientious
review of their temper and conduct, be enabled
to judge concerning them&s;elves; but he has
nothing to do to meddle with pa&s;&s;ing a final
&s;entence.</P>
<P>Sometimes a mini&s;ter is called to vi&s;it a &s;ick
per&s;on, of whom he knows very little, and of
who&s;e character and conver&s;ation he can obtain no
information beforehand. In this ca&s;e, all he can
do is, &startq;to lay before him what he ought to be,
and remind him to con&s;ult his con&s;cience what
<PB N="172" REF="179">
he has been;&endq; to repre&s;ent, in a plain and
&s;triking manner, the general con&s;iderations which
have been already mentioned, and particularly the
terms of the go&s;pel covenant; to urge him to
apply the&s;e things to him&s;elf, according as his
con&s;cience witne&s;&s;es concerning the &s;tate of his
&s;oul; and to exhort him to examine him&s;elf, to
begin or perfect his repentance, to confe&s;s his
&s;ins, re&s;olve again&s;t indulging them hereafter, and
implore forgivene&s;s; to be reconciled to his neigh|bours,
and forgive his enemies, to make re&s;titution
to any whom he has wronged, to do all the acts of
piety and virtue for which he finds opportunity,
and above all, to take care not to &s;in towards the
end of life; for if repentance on a death-bed be
very late for the &s;ins of life, what time is left to
repent of &s;ins committed on a death-bed? Some|times
a mini&s;ter, who knew nothing of a per&s;on
before he went to vi&s;it him, will, by conver&s;ing
with him, perceive &s;ome openings into his cha|racter,
and, by pur&s;uing the&s;e, may draw out of
him a more thorough knowlege of his temper;
and to this he &s;hould accommodate both his in&s;truc|tions
and exhortations. But as this may not
always happen, and as every one has not the
readine&s;s that is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uiting him&s;elf to
what he di&s;covers concerning a man's character
immediately and wholly off hand, a mini&s;ter
&s;hould do every thing he can to obtain inform|ation
concerning the character and conduct of
<PB N="173" REF="180">
per&s;ons, before he go to them in their &s;ickne&s;s,
that he may be able to apply him&s;elf &s;uitably to
them.</P>
<P>Sometimes a mini&s;ter meets with &s;ick per&s;ons
the whole tenor of who&s;e life gives him ground to
believe that they are truly good. Some of the&s;e
reap in their la&s;t hours the fruits of a well-&s;pent
life; he finds them rejoicing in the approbation of
a good con&s;cience, and in the hope of heaven. In
this ca&s;e, when there is rea&s;on to judge that their
joy and hope are well founded, a mini&s;ter has little
to do but to rejoice with them, and to encourage
them to thankfulne&s;s, and to that great act of
faith and tru&s;t which mu&s;t be exerted in re&s;igning
the &s;oul to its faithful Creator, as its guide into an
unknown &s;tate. It will not however be improper,
even in this ca&s;e, to exhort them to examine them|&s;elves
over and over again, that they may be ren|dered
&s;till more certain of their &s;tate; to repent &s;till
again particularly of all the &s;ins which they can
recollect; to pray for the pardon of their daily
infirmities, and of the &s;ecret faults which they
cannot recollect; and to fill up the remainder of
their lives with all the acts of virtue which they
can crowd into it. But even of good per&s;ons a
mini&s;ter will find &s;ome who are full of unea&s;ine&s;s
and fears. He &s;hould examine into the grounds of
their fears. If he find that they do not proceed
from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any habitual &s;ins, or of
incon&s;tancy in religious practice, but only from a
<PB N="174" REF="181">
&s;trong &s;en&s;e of the importance of the change of
&s;tate at death, and of the po&s;&s;ibility of their being
mi&s;taken in their judgment of them&s;elves (and this
alone will often occa&s;ion great unea&s;ine&s;s and
di&s;compo&s;ure in per&s;ons of timorous con&s;titutions);
then he ought to &s;et him&s;elf particularly to &s;trengthen
their faith, and encourage their re&s;ignation, by
repre&s;enting to them the goodne&s;s, compa&s;&s;ion, and
mercy of the divine nature, the di&s;play of it
already made in the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, the tender
care of God's providence, which they have expe|rienced
through life, the promi&s;es which he has
made to his &s;incere &s;ervants of pardon and &s;alva|tion,
the &s;ecurity for the performance of the&s;e
which ari&s;es both from the veracity of God, and
from the ble&s;&s;ings being already purcha&s;ed by
Chri&s;t. In this manner he &s;hould rai&s;e them to
hope, and endeavour to calm and compo&s;e them
for the great change which they are &s;oon to under|go.
At the &s;ame time, it is proper to give them
tho&s;e exhortations which we have already hinted at
with regard to other good men. All good men
&s;hould be exhorted in &s;ickne&s;s, to apply particu|larly
to &s;uch exerci&s;es as are peculiarly fit to pre|pare
them for death. Indeed, a good life is the
only preparation for death. But though it is by
far too late to begin our preparation for death when
&s;ickne&s;s is come on, and though &s;uch preparation
can &s;carcely an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e; yet even
they who have lived be&s;t will not find it unnece&s;&s;ary
to apply more particularly to prepare for death,
<PB N="175" REF="182">
when it &s;eems to be approaching. They &s;hould
therefore be exhorted to draw off their thoughts
and affections from pre&s;ent things, to conver&s;e
with them&s;elves more inten&s;ely and uninterruptedly
than they had done before, that they may get
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them&s;elves, that they may become
more acquainted and intimate with them&s;elves,
that they may &s;ee whether there be any &s;in which
they have not yet thoroughly reformed, any injury
which they have not repaired, any quarrel which
they have not made up, any part of their duty in
which they have been negligent, any virtue which
they find weak; and that they may &s;et about
putting all the&s;e things more perfectly to rights.
They &s;hould be exhorted to &s;pend a great part of
their time in acts of devotion, in prayer, in medi|tation,
in prai&s;e, that they may thus be rai&s;ed above
the world, and formed to the temper and employ|ment
of heaven.</P>
<P>But the work of a mini&s;ter is both mo&s;t di&s;|agreeable
and mo&s;t difficult when he finds tho&s;e
upon a &s;ick bed who&s;e pa&s;t conduct and temper
make it extremely probable, or next to certain, that
they are vicious and wicked, that they have the
work of their &s;alvation yet to begin. There is
&s;carcely any ground to hope for their perfecting
their repentance, or &s;ecuring their &s;alvation; and
yet it would be a melancholy work for a mini&s;ter
barely to tell them this and leave them; and it
might render them de&s;perate, and make them,
<PB N="176" REF="183">
through de&s;pair, die ob&s;tinate in their &s;ins. &startq;If
he find them &s;o ignorant as not to know what
faith and repentance mean; if they have led &s;o
carele&s;s lives in this world, as &s;carce ever to
have had a &s;erious thought of another; what is
to be done? can he do nothing but pray by
them, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s them into their eternal
&s;tate? It is certainly a very unpromi&s;ing
attempt, to teach men how to begin to live,
when they are ready to die, or to make them
&s;en&s;ible of their &s;ins in the moment of death,
when they never before be&s;towed a thought upon
them; yet a mini&s;ter &s;hould do what he can, by
his warm and &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, to inform and
awaken the con&s;ciences even of &s;uch<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, vol. i. p. 54, &amp;c.</NOTE>.&endq; He
will find &s;ome great &s;inners in&s;en&s;ible and uncon|cerned
even in the views of death. They will
only acknowlege that they are &s;inners, as well as
all other men, but they tru&s;t to the mercies of God
and the merits of Chri&s;t. To &s;uch he mu&s;t repre|&s;ent
the terrors of the wrath to come, and impre&s;s
them with lively apprehen&s;ions of it. In order to
make them &s;en&s;ible that they are in danger of it,
he mu&s;t endeavour to make them &s;en&s;ible of their
particular &s;ins, by leading them to di&s;cover them
them&s;elves, and by charging them with &s;uch as he
knows they have been guilty of; and he mu&s;t
expo&s;e the fal&s;e grounds of hope on which they
<PB N="177" REF="184">
build their confidence, and &s;how them the in|di&s;pen&s;able
nece&s;&s;ity of repentance and holine&s;s.
But if he &s;hould even &s;ucceed in awakening the
con&s;ciences of habitual &s;inners, or if he &s;hould
find &s;uch &s;inners, as he &s;ometimes will, &s;eized
with terror in the pro&s;pect of death, and the mi|ni&s;ter
called to give them comfort, what can he
then do? He &s;ees confu&s;ion in their faces, and
can di&s;cern the violent throes of a guilty con|&s;cience,
and the torturing fears of a &s;ad hereafter;
he knows that all their terrors are too ju&s;t, and
that it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that they can now &s;in|cerely
repent. But with what reluctance mu&s;t he
&s;peak the &s;evere truths which yet are fit for them
to hear? Shall he, therefore, immediately apply
to them all the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, merely be|cau&s;e
they are alarmed at the near approach of
death and judgment? Whatever pain it give him|&s;elf,
he mu&s;t beware of &s;peaking peace too ha&s;tily
to their &s;ouls. He &s;hould endeavour to prevent
ab&s;olute de&s;pair, but he mu&s;t do no more to com|fort
them; for the more they hope, it may for the
mo&s;t part be ju&s;tly &s;aid, the wor&s;e they are. With
regard to all wicked per&s;ons, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of
a mini&s;ter, to pre&s;s them to repent upon a &s;ick
bed as the be&s;t thing they can do, though the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of it be far from certain; to point out the acts
of repentance of which they are &s;till capable, and
put them upon performing them; to exhort them
to &s;orrow for their &s;ins, to confe&s;s them to God,
to re&s;olve again&s;t continuing in them if they &s;hould
<PB N="178" REF="185">
recover; to pray earne&s;tly for mercy and for true
repentance; to neglect no act of virtue for which
they have opportunity; in a word, to do all that
they can in the &s;hort time that yet remains. He
&s;hould inform them, that if their &s;alvation be yet
po&s;&s;ible, it can be only in this way.</P>
<P>Sometimes a &s;ickne&s;s is of &s;o long duration, that
per&s;ons have time, during the cour&s;e of it, to give
&s;trong marks of their repentance, patience, and
piety. The&s;e may be encouraged to &s;ome degree
of humble hope, though not without a mixture of
fear. But in every other ca&s;e, a mini&s;ter ought
not to give a per&s;on who has lived a wicked life,
any po&s;itive ground of hope, on account of the
forced and imperfect repentance which takes its
ri&s;e only on a &s;ick bed from the fears of hell. No|thing
can have more pernicious con&s;equences; it
makes the per&s;ons them&s;elves, if they die, peri&s;h
in &s;ecurity; it encourages them, if they recover,
to return to their &s;ins, in hopes of receiving as
quick and ea&s;y an ab&s;olution when they come
again to be laid on a &s;ick bed; and it leads all who
witne&s;s it, to what they are too prone to of them|&s;elves,
to put off religion to the la&s;t, when they
&s;ee that all may be made up &s;o ea&s;ily by a few &s;ighs
or tears in the concluding hours of life, when they
are not fit for &s;inning. All the promi&s;es of the
go&s;pel-covenant are made only to them who lead a
holy life; and &s;ince the&s;e promi&s;es are the only
foundation of our faith and hope in Chri&s;t, we
<PB N="179" REF="186">
cannot give encouragement beyond them to tho&s;e
who have lived a wicked life, and only begin to re|pent
of it in the hour of death. A mini&s;ter, there|fore,
can warrantably only do &s;ome of the follow|ing
things. He may urge a &s;inner to all the re|pentance
that he can perform, as the only po&s;&s;ible,
though now a very uncertain remedy, and to re|&s;ign
the event to the mercies of God in Chri&s;t
Je&s;us, &s;ince he has not ground for tru&s;t or confi|dence.
Or, he may repre&s;ent to him the terms of
the go&s;pel-covenant, and leave the application to
him&s;elf; but tell him withal, that the application
mu&s;t be difficult and uncertain. Or, he may tell
him, that his repentance will be accepted if it be
&s;incere and genuine; but inform him at the &s;ame
time, that whether it be, in his circum&s;tances,
&s;incere or not, neither the mini&s;ter, nor the per&s;on
him&s;elf, but God alone, can certainly know. How
can it be a&s;certained that a per&s;on is &s;incere in his
repentance, who is out of a capacity of giving
proof of its &s;incerity by amendment of life? How
can it be a&s;certained either to him&s;elf or others,
without its being at all tried? And how can it be
tried, when he is ju&s;t going out of the &s;tate of
trial? When we reflect how &s;mall a proportion
of tho&s;e who make a &s;how of repentance on a &s;ick
bed, and afterwards recover, live like penitents,
and lead truly holy lives, we may be convinced
that a death-bed repentance gives no ground for
higher hopes than we have repre&s;ented. But
though a mini&s;ter can give &s;o little comfort, and
<PB N="180" REF="187">
though it be &s;o extremely doubtful whether all the
repentance to which he can bring wicked men
upon a &s;ick bed will be available to their &s;alvation,
yet his vi&s;its to &s;uch are not altogether u&s;ele&s;s. If
they &s;hould recover, the &s;en&s;e of the dangerous
&s;tate in which they were, and the &s;entiments which
have been rendered familiar to them during their
&s;ickne&s;s, may, perhaps, be the beginnings of a
new life, and the principles of a thorough amend|ment.
In order to promote this the more, a mi|ni&s;ter
&s;hould urge the &s;ick per&s;ons whom he vi&s;its,
to make &s;olemn vows of amending the vices to
which they have been formerly addicted, of prac|ti&s;ing
the duties which they have hitherto neglected;
and he &s;hould exact particular promi&s;es on the&s;e
heads. Whenever they recover, he &s;hould put
them in mind of the&s;e, oblige them to renew them,
recommend it to them to repeat them often. If
he ob&s;erve them tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing them in any in&s;tance,
he &s;hould reprove them for it. If they appear to
throw off all regard to them, as is too often the
ca&s;e, then he may &s;afely a&s;&s;ure them, that if they
had died in their &s;ickne&s;s, as their repentance was
not &s;incere, they mu&s;t infallibly have peri&s;hed;
and he ought to warn them beforehand, that if
they per&s;i&s;t in a cour&s;e of vice till they again fall
upon a &s;ick bed, all the &s;tronge&s;t &s;how of repent|ance
and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s which they can then put on,
will be of no advantage to their &s;alvation. Such
awful denunciations may, perhaps, awaken them;
but though they &s;hould not, the mini&s;ter has done
<PB N="181" REF="188">
his duty by making them, and their guilt re&s;ts
upon their own heads.</P>
<P>There is a middle cla&s;s of per&s;ons, the incon|&s;tant
and wavering. With the&s;e, al&s;o, it is not
ea&s;y to know how to deal, in &s;ickne&s;s and the
pro&s;pect of death. It is not ea&s;y to judge, whether
all the infirmities which have attended them, be
con&s;i&s;tent with &s;incerity on the whole; whether
their frequent relap&s;es after repentance be con|&s;i&s;tent
with the truth of that repentance; whether
their &s;ins be con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of grace and the
hope of heaven; whether they are failings, or were
committed in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a mea&s;ure of con|viction
and power of re&s;i&s;tance as makes them
wilful and pre&s;umptuous<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Ca&s;es, vol. i, p. 57.</NOTE>? All that a mini&s;ter
can do in this ca&s;e, is to repre&s;ent the real doctrine

and to enforce the deep repentance con|fe&s;&s;edly
requi&s;ite, in &s;uch a manner as neither on
the one hand to di&s;courage hope, nor on the other
to encourage confidence.</P>
<P>It is cu&s;tomary, not only to admoni&s;h &s;ick per|&s;ons,
but al&s;o to pray with them; and it is indeed
proper, though the prayers of a mini&s;ter be often
regarded too much in a &s;uper&s;titious light. Any
of the proper materials of devotion are, no doubt,
<PB N="182" REF="189">
proper materials of prayer on &s;uch occa&s;ions; but
&s;ome &s;ubjects of devotion have a peculiar propriety;
as expre&s;&s;ions of the holine&s;s and the mercy of
God; of his perfection, and &s;uperiority to all evil;
of his eternal and immutable happine&s;s; of his
univer&s;al authority and providence, by which he
di&s;po&s;es all things, and without which nothing can
befall us, nor a hair of our heads fall to the
ground; of our dependence upon him, and of the
frailty of our nature; of his tender care, pity, and
indulgence to good men; of the merciful ends for
which he afflicts, and the good fruits which we
may derive from afflictions, by bearing and im|proving
them aright; expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to
God for the mercies which he continually be&s;tows,
even in the mid&s;t of adver&s;ity, but e&s;pecially for
the mediation of Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel covenant,
which is the only foundation of hope to fallen
creatures; for the glorious ble&s;&s;ings that are pro|mi&s;ed
in it; and for the rea&s;onable and ea&s;y terms
which are required; joined with expre&s;&s;ions of our
full per&s;ua&s;ion, that we can be accepted only on
the&s;e terms, and that neither the mercies of God,
nor the purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t, will be extended to any
who remain unpenitent in &s;in; petitions for a deep
&s;en&s;e of our obligations as Chri&s;tians; for patience
to bear afflictions; for grace to make a proper u&s;e
of them; for the pardon of &s;in according to the
go&s;pel terms; for the recovery of the &s;ick per&s;on;
for bringing him to repentance, or for perfecting
his &s;anctification; for mercy to his &s;oul if he die,
<PB N="183" REF="190">
for the peculiar care of God in the moment of
death, and in conducting him into the un&s;een
world; for grace to lead all to a &s;en&s;e of the cer|tainty
and importance of death, and to a con&s;tant
preparation for it. The&s;e and other &s;imilar &s;enti|ments,
which will naturally occur, have plainly a
particular propriety in prayers for &s;ick per&s;ons.</P>
<P>It has been already remarked, that in all admo|nitions
to &s;ick per&s;ons, a regard &s;hould be had to
&s;pectators. And it is often one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful
purpo&s;es of vi&s;iting &s;ick per&s;ons, to give tho&s;e that
are about them &s;uch admonitions as naturally ari&s;e
from the occa&s;ion. They may very probably have
a peculiar degree of force, when they are preached
from a &s;ick bed as a text. It will be very proper
to impre&s;s them with a &s;en&s;e of their mortality, of
the uncertainty of life, and to pre&s;s them to a
&s;peedy and timeous preparation for death. The
particular &s;ituation of the &s;ick per&s;on will &s;ugge&s;t
particular con&s;iderations which may be propo&s;ed
to them. A good man, compo&s;ed and joyful in
the view of death, may be repre&s;ented to them
as a living and &s;triking example of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s
of religion and goodne&s;s. From &s;eeing a good
man in &s;ome degree of fear, they may be warned,
how much ju&s;ter ground of fear they have, who&s;e
con&s;ciences tell them that they have led wor&s;e lives.
The agonies of a dying &s;inner &s;upply a &s;trong pic|ture
of the mi&s;ery of vice, which may alarm the
mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible. The vain hopes of a wicked man
<PB N="184" REF="191">
give a proper handle to repre&s;ent the obduracy
which &s;prings from continnance in &s;in, depriving
men of all &s;en&s;e both of guilt and of danger. Every
other peculiarity in the &s;ituation of a &s;ick per&s;on
will, in like manner, &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome &s;uitable ex|hortation
to &s;pectators. In every ca&s;e, it is proper
for a mini&s;ter to comfort the relations, and to in|culcate
on them re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>This duty of the pa&s;toral office is both important
and of a very delicate nature. We have, there|fore,
been the more particular in explaining it.
But, after all, there will &s;o many minute varieties
ari&s;e in particular ca&s;es, that, notwith&s;tanding all
the directions that can be given, there will remain
great need for prudence and attention. Not only
the u&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e labours to others &s;hould re|commend
them to the careful practice of a mi|ni&s;ter,
but likewi&s;e the influence which the right
performance of them will have on the improve|ment
of his own heart. Nothing can have a
&s;tronger tendency to excite men to all holine&s;s,
than the frequent occa&s;ions which mini&s;ters have
of going into the hou&s;e of mourning, and con|ver&s;ing
with the &s;ick. They are a continual pre|&s;ervative
again&s;t the infection and corruptions of
pro&s;perity. To &s;ee virtue &s;upporting tho&s;e who
have been &s;teady in the practice of it, in their late&s;t
moments, under the agonies of pain, and enabling
them to triumph in the pro&s;pect of death, is na|turally
a &s;trong incitement to virtue. To &s;ee a
<PB N="185" REF="192">
&s;mall degree of con&s;cious vice di&s;quieting a good
man, mu&s;t excite a mini&s;ter to the greate&s;t vigi|lance.
To &s;ee the horrors of vice taking fa&s;t hold
on the &s;turdie&s;t &s;inners, can &s;carcely fail of deter|ring
him from &s;in. Opportunities of this kind
returning &s;o often to a mini&s;ter, that the impre&s;&s;ion
made by one in&s;tance can &s;carce decay, till it be
revived and &s;trengthened by another, mu&s;t form
him to virtue, if he be not de&s;titute of all prin|ciples
of reformation. And every mini&s;ter &s;hould
be careful to execute the&s;e duties in &s;uch a manner
as not to lo&s;e the advantages which they afford for
his own improvement.</P>
</DIV4>

<P>ANOTHER duty of the pa&s;toral office is to re|prove
and rebuke &s;uch as are faulty in their moral
conduct. This is always di&s;agreeable to a man of
mode&s;ty and goodne&s;s; but reproofs and rebukes
are often nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful for reforming &s;inners;
and whenever they are &s;o, the &s;cripture makes it
the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of a mini&s;ter to tender them.
Thus the apo&s;tle commands Timothy to &startq;reprove
and rebuke with all long-&s;uffering and doctrine<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>,&endq;
<PB N="186" REF="193">
to expo&s;e to wicked per&s;ons the ba&s;ene&s;s of their
conduct, and admoni&s;h them to amend. And he
commands Titus to &startq;rebuke &s;harply<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Tit. i. 13.</NOTE>&endq; certain
unruly per&s;ons, and in general to &startq;rebuke,&endq;
as well as to &startq;&s;peak and exhort with all autho|rity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 15.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>To rebuke in &s;uch a manner as may give a
probability of its an&s;wering a good end, will gene|rally
require a con&s;iderable degree of prudence
and addre&s;s, and will always require care to &s;uit it
both to the nature of the offence, and to the cir|cum&s;tances
in which the rebuke is given.</P>
<P>Sometimes things worthy of rebuke are done
by per&s;ons in the pre&s;ence of a mini&s;ter. Oaths
and imprecations are &s;ometimes uttered; &s;enti|ments
are expre&s;&s;ed and avowed, that tend to pol|lute
the imaginations, or corrupt the hearts of men;
and &s;ometimes even topics are enlarged upon,
which are irreligious, immoral, or indecent. It
is always nece&s;&s;ary for a mini&s;ter, in this ca&s;e,
to &s;how his di&s;approbation; but great prudence
is nece&s;&s;ary in choo&s;ing the proper way of &s;how|ing
it.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome ca&s;es of this kind, in which a
grave rebuke, and &s;erious arguments, to &s;how the
<PB N="187" REF="194">
badne&s;s of the conduct, will be both proper and
effectual. When the offenders are of the lower
&s;ort, &s;o that they and all others mu&s;t acknowlege
the mini&s;ter's &s;uperiority to them; or when they
are not hardened in vice, but appear to have run
into the indecency more through inadvertence than
bad di&s;po&s;ition, this method of di&s;approbation is
generally proper. A man of prudence will, from
his knowlege of the circum&s;tances of each parti|cular
ca&s;e, judge when it is proper to apply it,
that is, when it is likely to do good. But it is
plain that there are many ca&s;es, in which this
method would do harm in&s;tead of good; and as
rebukes are u&s;eful only for the end they an&s;wer,
it can never be incumbent on a mini&s;ter to u&s;e them
in the&s;e ca&s;es. Yet &s;till, as a &s;ubordinate end of
them is to warn others, and prevent their being
infected, a mini&s;ter &s;hould u&s;e &s;ome other method
of &s;howing his di&s;&s;atisfaction. Sometimes a hint
dropped with good humour, from which the per|&s;on
him&s;elf may ea&s;ily infer the indecency of his
conduct, and the mini&s;ter's &s;en&s;e of it, or a &s;tory
&s;erving this purpo&s;e, will have a very good effect.
At the &s;ame time that it &s;hows a man's &s;en&s;e of the
indecency of the conduct, it &s;hows an unwilling|ne&s;s
to find fault, and a tenderne&s;s and de&s;erence
for the per&s;on, which cannot fail to touch tho&s;e
who have any degree of ingenuity, though they
would have perhaps been irritated, and rendered
ob&s;tinate in defending them&s;elves, by a plain
reproof. Sometimes a mini&s;ter may plainly per|ceive,
<PB N="188" REF="195">
that even this would provoke the offender
to proceed to greater outrages. In that ca&s;e he
may &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, by turning the conver|&s;ation
to &s;ome more innocent and u&s;eful topic.
By this means, he will at lea&s;t prevent the repeti|tion
and continuance of the offence; and very
probably the offender may, if not immediately,
yet afterwards, perceive the meaning of the
tran&s;ition, and be gained by the gentlene&s;s which
attended it. If a per&s;on be &s;o obdurate, that none
of the&s;e methods can influence him, a mini&s;ter may
&s;ufficiently &s;how his di&s;approbation of the indecency
to the re&s;t of the company, by pre&s;erving &s;ilence of
an expre&s;&s;ive kind. But if the indecency ri&s;e high,
and cannot be checked by any of the&s;e methods,
a mini&s;ter &s;hould withdraw from the company, and
not give even the degree of &s;eeming approbation,
which might perhaps be inferred merely from his
pre&s;ence. There is another way which may &s;ome|times
be tried with good &s;ucce&s;s. If the indecency
be &s;uch, that a mini&s;ter can at all bear to witne&s;s
it, he may &s;eem to let it pa&s;s in the company
unob&s;erved, and take the fir&s;t opportunity which
occurs conveniently to mention it to the offender
in private. In this &s;ituation he will not be &s;o
ready to grow ob&s;tinate in defending it; he will
be more ea&s;ily convinced of its impropriety; he
will be apter to acknowlege the fault, and may
po&s;&s;ibly afterwards him&s;elf inform the company of
the di&s;approbation he met with; at any rate,
the tenderne&s;s which is in this way &s;hown to his
<PB N="189" REF="196">
reputation, mu&s;t, if he have any degree either of
&s;en&s;e or goodne&s;s, prevent his being provoked by
the admonition.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be left wholly to a mini&s;ter's own pru|dence
to di&s;cover which of the&s;e methods of reproof
&s;uits every particular ca&s;e. But &s;till it mu&s;t be
remembered, that a mini&s;ter ought in no ca&s;e to
&s;how the lea&s;t appearance of approving any thing
that is indecent or immoral, or even an uncon|cernedne&s;s
about it. A great degree of mode&s;ty
may tempt a mini&s;ter to this; but it is a fal&s;e and
exce&s;&s;ive mode&s;ty: and however amiable this
quality is in it&s;elf, yet whenever it hinders a man
from doing his duty, or makes him a&s;hamed of
adhering to &s;trict virtue, it becomes a real vice.
A mini&s;ter &s;hould &s;et him&s;elf to conquer it, and to
obtain &s;uch a degree of a&s;&s;urance, as may both
enable him to do his duty when the intere&s;ts of
virtue and religion are concerned, and to do it
with that ea&s;e and addre&s;s which may render it
&s;ucce&s;sful. If an exce&s;s of mode&s;ty cannot excu&s;e
a mini&s;ter from performing this part of his duty,
much le&s;s can a &s;ervile complai&s;ance to rank and
fortune, which is vicious in it&s;elf. Indeed, a
neglect of this duty can never fail to bring upon a
mini&s;ter &s;u&s;picion of his being indifferent about
virtue, to dimini&s;h his authority and influence, to
expo&s;e him to contempt, and to bring the whole
order into di&s;repute. I &s;hall only remark farther,
that as rebuking &s;eems in its very nature to imply
<PB N="190" REF="197">
a claim to &s;uperiority, the greate&s;t care mu&s;t be
u&s;ed to take off, as much as po&s;&s;ible, this appear|ance,
by the manner of giving it, without the
mo&s;t di&s;tant approach to pa&s;&s;ion, pertne&s;s, in&s;o|lence,
or a&s;&s;uming, with the &s;tronge&s;t marks of
meekne&s;s and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But it is not only offences committed in a
mini&s;ter's company, that are the proper &s;ubjects of
rebuke. A mini&s;ter mu&s;t admoni&s;h his pari&s;h|ioners,
for whatever faults he either learns from
others, or di&s;covers by his own conver&s;ation with
them, to prevail in their temper or their conduct.
Heinous crimes require &s;evere rebukes; and even
&s;lighter deviations from virtue mu&s;t be reproved,
that both the per&s;ons, them&s;elves may be reclaimed
from them, and the contagion kept from &s;eizing
others. But the&s;e two different &s;orts of faults
mu&s;t not be treated in the &s;ame way. The apo&s;tle
Jude points out the di&s;tinction which &s;hould be
made between them: &startq;of &s;ome have compa&s;&s;ion,
and others &s;ave with fear, pulling them out of
the fire<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jude, xxii. 23.</NOTE>.&endq; Gentler remedies mu&s;t be applied
to the le&s;&s;er irregularities of the &s;oul. But the
deeper pollutions of the &s;oul, like the more dan|gerous
wounds of the body, mu&s;t be &s;earched and
probed, and have more painful remedies applied to
them. Again, all &s;orts of per&s;ons mu&s;t be admo|ni&s;hed
<PB N="191" REF="198">
and rebuked, when their conduct de&s;erves
it, but not all in the &s;ame manner. The &s;ame
apo&s;tle Paul, who commands Timothy and Titus
&s;o often to reprove, yet directs the former,
&startq;rebuke [not an elder, but intreat him as a
father<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 1.</NOTE>.&endq; This direction is applicable to all &s;upe|riors,
whether in age, education, rank, or for|tune.
According to the natural &s;entiments of
mankind, all the&s;e qualities produce a kind of
&s;uperiority; and deference and re&s;pect is our duty
to all &s;uperiors; a duty the obligation of which
their faults cannot extingui&s;h. When the offender
is plainly our inferior, we have a natural authority
which gives us a right to addre&s;s him without much
ceremony. It is generally &s;ufficient with &s;uch
to profe&s;s our concern for them, our &s;incere inten|tion
of their good, and immediately to enter on the
part of their conduct that is blameable: their &s;en&s;e
of their inferiority will keep them from taking
offence at the freedom. It is generally nece&s;&s;ary
to repre&s;ent the fault to them fully and in &s;trong
colours; for their want of improvement would
prevent their under&s;tanding your meaning, if you
&s;hould touch it more &s;lightly, or endeavour to
point out its evil by hints. It is often likewi&s;e
proper to condemn it with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of
authority and di&s;plea&s;ure, though always without
anger or pa&s;&s;ion; for the lower &s;orts of men have
<PB N="192" REF="199">
&s;o little of delicate feeling, that without this they
will &s;carce think you in earne&s;t. But it will ea&s;ily
appear that this method of addre&s;s would be often
improper to per&s;ons of &s;uperior quality or abilities.
It would &s;carcely be con&s;i&s;tent with the deference
and re&s;pect due to them; and therefore, in reprov|ing
their faults in this manner, a mini&s;ter would
really tran&s;gre&s;s his own duty. Rebukes are not
enjoined for their own &s;ake, but for the &s;ake of the
good effects which they produce; and there is the
greate&s;t probability of their being u&s;eful to &s;upe|riors,
by their being managed in another way. It
is often proper to wait or to &s;eek for an occa&s;ion
which will naturally introduce a rebuke, that
you may not &s;eem to be fond of finding fault. It
is often proper not to dwell long on the fault, but
to give a few hints of its ba&s;ene&s;s; for &s;uperior
parts always, and often even the improvement
which ari&s;es from the conver&s;ation of the higher
ranks, give a penetration and acutene&s;s which
enable men to take a hint; and if they do, it will
have this advantage, that their conviction will
&s;pring chiefly from their own reflections in pur&s;u|ing
it. It is generally proper to avoid an appear|ance
of di&s;plea&s;ure, becau&s;e per&s;ons of better rank
will probably be offended with it; and therefore it
will defeat the end of the rebuke. And that can
never be ju&s;tified by the dignity or authority of a
mini&s;ter, which ari&s;es only from the good and
important end of his office. He never de&s;cends
from his dignity, nay he &s;upports it mo&s;t truly,
<PB N="193" REF="200">
when he &s;ubmits to the likelie&s;t means of doing
good. It will be &s;ometimes the be&s;t way, e&s;pe|cially
with regard to le&s;&s;er faults, to expre&s;s a
general cen&s;ure, or to give an oblique in&s;inuation
again&s;t them, without directly charging them upon
the per&s;on. This will be &s;ufficient with &s;ome di&s;|cerning
and ingenuous per&s;ons; and whenever it
is &s;ufficient, it is the mo&s;t eligible, and will be the
mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful method. Sometimes al&s;o, a man's
vices may be reproved, by condemning the &s;ame
or &s;imilar ones in another per&s;on. The parable by
which Nathan reproved David, is an in&s;tance of
this. Many of our Saviour's parables too are re|proofs
of his hearers. This method is always in|offen&s;ive,
and will often be extremely convincing
and effectual. The guilty per&s;on will often feel
&s;trong &s;entiments of di&s;approbation again&s;t his own
vices, when they are repre&s;ented as belonging to
another; and, by &s;howing him that his own con|duct
is &s;imilar, the&s;e &s;entiments, when they are
already rai&s;ed, may be ea&s;ily transferred to him&s;elf,
and converted into remor&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been already remarked, that the only end
of rebukes is amendment; therefore a mini&s;ter
mu&s;t not think that he has di&s;charged his duty,
merely by telling a per&s;on his faults. He mu&s;t
ob&s;erve what effect the rebuke produces; if it pro|duce
not amendment, he mu&s;t repeat it; if it
produce this, he &s;hould encourage the per&s;on to
per&s;i&s;t and to improve. Attention to the de&s;ign
and u&s;e of reproof will likewi&s;e direct a mini&s;ter
<PB N="194" REF="201">
con&s;iderably in many circum&s;tances relating to the
manner of rebuking. One &s;hould give cautions
oftener than rebukes; always, when they are
likely to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. When a rebuke is
nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hould not be given har&s;hly; with
concern, not with anger. Some per&s;ons might be
apt to find fault, merely to give vent to their own
&s;pleen and ill-nature; and when reproof proceeds
from this principle, it can &s;carcely fail to be given
in a haughty, &s;upercilious, or pa&s;&s;ionate manner.
Attention to its de&s;ign will effectually check this;
for a &s;u&s;picion of pique, or &s;pleen, or humour is &s;o
&s;ure to render reproof ineffectual, that it is gene|rally
eligible to let it alone altogether, when it is
likely, from particular circum&s;tances, to give ri&s;e
to this &s;u&s;picion. Every reproof ought, on the
contrary, to bear all the marks of tenderne&s;s,
meekne&s;s, and friend&s;hip, and even to be accom|panied
with warm expre&s;&s;ions of benevolence and
concern. It is generally be&s;t that rebukes be given
&s;ecretly and kept &s;ecret; for this will give them a
&s;trong appearance of &s;oftne&s;s and meekne&s;s, will
&s;how a tenderne&s;s to the per&s;on's reputation, and,
by this means, will gain upon him. A man di&s;|likes
to be condemned in the pre&s;ence of others,
and often thinks him&s;elf obliged in honour to at|tempt
to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, though he be really &s;en|&s;ible
of his faults. The di&s;po&s;ition to this will be
prevented, or at lea&s;t dimini&s;hed, by the &s;ecrecy
of the rebuke. This &s;pirit will, indeed, &s;o far
prevail &s;ometimes, that an offender will attempt to
excu&s;e his fault even to a mini&s;ter alone, when he
<PB N="195" REF="202">
is notwith&s;tanding &s;en&s;ible of it. On this account,
a mini&s;ter cannot always conclude that his reproof
has been entirely u&s;ele&s;s, even when the per&s;on's
pride would not &s;uffer him to acknowlege his fault;
for it may, notwith&s;tanding, be remembered after|wards,
and produce &s;ome effect upon him. It is
of importance to choo&s;e fit times for admoni&s;hing
and rebuking; for a per&s;on will often bear at one
time what he would not at another. A per&s;on
may be bettered by a rebuke given when he is ea&s;y
and in good humour, who would have been pro|voked
by it, if it had been given when he was
perplexed or out of humour with &s;omething which
di&s;compo&s;ed him. A per&s;on will li&s;ten to a re|buke,
when, by any emergence, he is put into a
&s;erious and thoughtful temper, who would have
paid no regard to it in an hour of gaiety and di&s;&s;i|pation.
Sometimes the approach of a communion
will give a mini&s;ter a favourable opportunity of re|proving
men for their vices, and of urging them
to for&s;ake them, that he may not be obliged to
exclude them. Sometimes he may take occa&s;ion,
from their de&s;iring to have their children baptized,
to admoni&s;h them of &s;ome faults, particularly of
&s;uch as look like a renouncing of their Chri&s;tian
profe&s;&s;ion, and repre&s;ent the nece&s;&s;ity of amending
them, in order to their being reckoned Chri&s;tians
them&s;elves, or having their children intitled to
bapti&s;m. However delicate a matter it is to give
reproof, yet, if a mini&s;ter have prudence, and
be&s;tow the nece&s;&s;ary reflection, he may almo&s;t
<PB N="196" REF="203">
always fall on &s;ome method &s;o &s;oft and inoffen&s;ive,
as even to affect the wor&s;t men, at lea&s;t as not to
irritate and do harm. This is often the ill effect
of rebukes, indi&s;creetly managed. Some men,
who&s;e zeal is greater than their prudence, think
them&s;elves obliged to treat all in preci&s;ely the &s;ame
way, and imagine that any other conduct would
&s;how a faulty re&s;pect of per&s;ons. Pride and conceit
are, &s;ometimes, in this ca&s;e mi&s;taken for zeal.
But even when the conduct proceeds from real
zeal, it is from zeal ill-conducted, and defeating
it&s;elf. I therefore repeat, that reproof is only u&s;e|ful
on account of its end, and therefore &s;hould be
always managed in the way that is fitte&s;t for pro|ducing
reformation.</P>
<P>A mini&s;ter ought to maintain an exact impar|tiality
to all, and to &s;how no re&s;pect to the great
and rich, more than to the meane&s;t. But this
does not require that he &s;hould behave to them in
preci&s;ely the &s;ame way. On the contrary, to treat
them in the &s;ame way would be ab&s;olutely wrong.
It mu&s;t be remembered, that the great and primary
end of rebuking men is always their reformation,
and that, of con&s;equence, it is &s;trictly the duty of
a mini&s;ter to rebuke only in &s;uch a way, as is mo&s;t
likely to an&s;wer this end. Now not only the dif|ferent
tempers, but al&s;o the different educations,
ranks, and circum&s;tances of men, render different
methods of reproof fitte&s;t to reform them, and
render a method of reproof, which will have great
<PB N="197" REF="204">
force with one, ab&s;olutely unfit to work on another.
A mini&s;ter who is careful to find out the proper
manner, and to apply it, not only is not guilty of
partiality, though it be very oppo&s;ite to the kind
which he &s;ometimes u&s;es on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, but
really could not di&s;charge his duty without it. A
mini&s;ter &s;hould rebuke all ranks impartially and
without re&s;pect of per&s;ons; but he is impartial
only then, when he rebukes each in the way that
is likelie&s;t to work on him, however different that
way be from what he finds it proper to u&s;e to an|other;
and not to make this difference, would
really be a &s;pecies of partiality, It is in vain to
&s;ay that a mini&s;ter cannot exoner his con&s;cience,
without u&s;ing an uniform method of reproof with
all different ranks; for con&s;cience requires, not
only that he &s;hould warn all, but likewi&s;e that he
&s;hould be careful to do it in the mo&s;t effectual
way. But &s;till, a mini&s;ter is under a real and in|di&s;pen&s;able
obligation to rebuke all offenders, as
long as there is any hope of them, in that way
which he judges will be mo&s;t effectual with each.
There may be &s;ome, indeed, &s;o very profligate,
that to reprove them will only make us the objects
of their &s;corn and hatred. When we are &s;ure
that this is the ca&s;e, our Saviour has excu&s;ed us
from meddling with them, when he &s;ays, &ldquo;Give
not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither
ca&s;t ye your pearls before &s;wine, le&s;t they tram|ple
them under their feet, and turn again and
<PB N="198" REF="205">
rend you<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 6.</NOTE>.&endq; But a mini&s;ter ought not ha&s;tily
and ra&s;hly to take it for granted, that men are thus
abandoned; indolence or indifference will often
plead this excu&s;e, when there is no real ground
for it; but before men be thus given over as in|corrigible,
a mini&s;ter mu&s;t have the &s;tronge&s;t and
mo&s;t &s;atisfying and inconte&s;table proofs of their
being really &s;o; if he has not the&s;e, he is inex|cu&s;eable
for neglecting to watch all opportunities
to reprove them. When it is plain that they are
incorrigible, a mini&s;ter &s;hould, as much as po&s;&s;ible,
&s;hun their company; whenever he does not think
him&s;elf obliged to this, he &s;hould reckon him&s;elf
obliged to rebuke them. It may be likewi&s;e pro|per,
&s;ometimes to warn others to beware of the
infection of their example; this may &s;et them a
thinking, and produce their amendment.</P>
<P>It is a natural remark on this &s;ubject, that a
mini&s;ter ought not to frequent the company of
any, who&s;e conduct contains many things worthy
of rebuke. Not to rebuke them, will de&s;ervedly
de&s;troy his authority; and if he rebuke them al|ways
when there is occa&s;ion, he cannot continue
long fond of their company, nor they of his.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Convincing.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is another duty of the pa&s;toral office
&s;omewhat a-kin to reproving, I mean Convincing.
Rebuking regards the practice of men; Con|vincing
regards their principles. Paul exhorts a
mini&s;ter to &ldquo;hold fa&s;t the faithful word, that he
may be able, by found doctrine, both to exhort
and to convince the gain&s;ayers<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Tit. i. 9.</NOTE>.&endq; To the
&s;ame purpo&s;e is what he writes to Timothy:
&ldquo;The &s;ervant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be
gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in
meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them|&s;elves,
if God peradventure will give them
repentance to the acknowleging of the truth<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 24, 25.</NOTE>.&endq;
A mini&s;ter may &s;ometimes have occa&s;ion to con|vince
tho&s;e of our own communion, of particular
errors which they may have embraced; and &s;ome|times
he will have occa&s;ion to confute and con|vince
tho&s;e who are not of our per&s;ua&s;ion. We
need not con&s;ider the&s;e two &s;eparately; for they
are di&s;tingui&s;hed only by a greater or a le&s;s
degree of difference of opinion; and the means of
<PB N="200" REF="207">
convincing both are the &s;ame; for a mini&s;ter has
no dictatorial power over the former any more than
the latter; he is no lord over God's heritage,
nor has any right to dominion over the faith of
Chri&s;tians. His whole power is mini&s;terial; the
only in&s;truments he mu&s;t u&s;e for accompli&s;hing any
of the ends of his office, are in&s;truction, rea&s;oning,
per&s;ua&s;ion. A mini&s;ter &s;hould take every fit oppor|tunity
of endeavouring to convince tho&s;e whom he
knows to entertain errors. The more dangerous
any error is, that is, the more immediately it
influences practice, the more earne&s;t and a&s;&s;iduous
he &s;hould be in endeavouring to reclaim people
from it. In order to be able to attempt this, it is
nece&s;&s;ary that a mini&s;ter be thoroughly acquainted
with the &s;ubject in di&s;pute, and with the principles
and &s;pirit of tho&s;e whom he endeavours to con|vince.
In the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted &s;tate of Chri&s;t|ianity,
there are many different &s;orts who are
involved in error, as infidels, papi&s;ts, &s;eceders,
methodi&s;ts, quakers, &amp;c. &s;ome of which a mini&s;ter
will mo&s;t readily meet with in &s;ome &s;ituations, and
others in another. He ought to qualify him&s;elf
for dealing particularly with tho&s;e who are to be
found in his pari&s;h. In endeavouring to convince
them, he &s;hould u&s;e only &s;olid argument and calm
rea&s;oning; for unfair arts in making pro&s;elytes are
perfectly unju&s;tifiable; they may &s;ometimes entrap
the weak, but if they are detected, they will only
confirm men in their own way, and expo&s;e the
per&s;on who u&s;ed them to ju&s;t abhorrence; and any
<PB N="201" REF="208">
degree of heat and pa&s;&s;ion will look either as if a
man had an ill cau&s;e, or as if his de&s;ire to con|vince
them aro&s;e only from his own humour and
de&s;ire of conque&s;t. Before a mini&s;ter can expect
to gain on tho&s;e who differ from him, he mu&s;t
&s;how them that he loves them and wi&s;hes them
&s;incerely well, by u&s;ing them with all kindne&s;s, by
doing them obliging offices, by betraying no di&s;po|&s;ition
to put them to any inconvenience on account
of their difference of &s;entiment, by rejoicing in the
toleration they enjoy, and the liberty they have of
profe&s;&s;ing their belief according to their con|&s;ciences;
in a word, by all the methods of charity,
meekne&s;s, and moderation. This will di&s;po&s;e them
to li&s;ten to his arguments. To give the&s;e their
full weight, he mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;tudy to combat the
perver&s;ene&s;s of their wills, their prejudices, the
de&s;ire of victory and applau&s;e, their pre-engage|ment
in a party, and their &s;hame and unwillingne&s;s
to yield; and &s;trive to render them meek and
pliable, and &s;incerely de&s;irous to know the truth.
When this is obtained, they will either be more
ea&s;ily convinced, or more excu&s;eable, if through
weakne&s;s they &s;till continue in their errors<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Scougal.</NOTE>. He
&s;hould, by friendly di&s;cour&s;e, di&s;cover what led
them into their errors, and then he will know
better how to lead them out again. A mini&s;ter
ought not to de&s;pair of convincing di&s;&s;enters, or
<PB N="202" REF="209">
per&s;ons in an error, upon a few un&s;ucce&s;sful
attempts. Men's principles really depend &s;o much
on their education, that it is not to be expected
that a ha&s;ty conference or a &s;hort di&s;pute &s;hould
prevail with tho&s;e who have been long habituated
to fal&s;e principles, and &s;ucked them in with their
nur&s;e's milk, to abandon them all at once.
They mu&s;t be treated with great patience and
long-&s;uffering, and wrought upon by arguments
frequently repeated. A mini&s;ter mu&s;t vi&s;it them
often in a &s;pirit of love, and offer them confer|ences.
He may likewi&s;e direct them to &s;uch books
as are fitte&s;t for rectifying their mi&s;takes, that they
may read and weigh them at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>The emi&s;&s;aries of the church of Rome &s;ometimes
make an impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e whom they want to
convert, by this argument, that it is &s;afe&s;t to join
their church, becau&s;e Prote&s;tants them&s;elves allow
the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation in it, whereas Papi&s;ts
allow no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation out of it. This
may have weight with very weak per&s;ons; but a
&s;mall degree of under&s;tanding may &s;atisfy a man,
that an uncharitable, judging, damning &s;pirit, is no
probable mark of the true Chri&s;tian church. A
mini&s;ter ought not to adopt this conduct, or to
attempt to magnify the differences between &s;ects
and parties, in order to make pro&s;elytes. Indeed,
the errors of &s;ome parties are &s;o gro&s;s, and have &s;o
direct an influence on practice, that it needs no
exaggeration to &s;how per&s;ons the nece&s;&s;ity of quit|ting
<PB N="203" REF="210">
them. In&s;idelity, for in&s;tance, implies a total
rejection of Chri&s;tianity, and therefore mu&s;t be
attended with the mo&s;t dreadful hazard. In
Popery, Chri&s;tianity is &s;o corrupted and over|clouded
with idolatry, &s;uper&s;tition, and tyranny,
as renders it very difficult for tho&s;e of that commu|nion
to direct their endeavours to true holine&s;s.
Quakers reject many of the e&s;&s;ential in&s;titutions of
the go&s;pel. Some parties, as &s;eceders and inde|pendents,
adopt antinomiani&s;m, and thus make
void the law by faith. Some parties too are ruled
by a bitter &s;pirit, incon&s;i&s;tent with that love which
is the end of the commandment, which is our
Saviour's new and peculiar commandment, which
is greater than faith and hope; and they thus
de&s;troy Chri&s;tian charity. A mini&s;ter may ju&s;tly
repre&s;ent &s;uch errors as the&s;e as highly dangerous,
and &s;hould &s;et him&s;elf with a proportionable zeal
to correct them in tho&s;e in his pari&s;h who may be
infected with them. There are other differences
among Prote&s;tants, which have not &s;o great influ|ence
on practice, and therefore are of le&s;s con&s;e|quence.
A mini&s;ter &s;hould not attempt to magnify
the&s;e. On the contrary, he &s;hould &s;how how
in&s;ufficient they are to interrupt the cour&s;e of
Chri&s;tian love, or to produce divi&s;ion; how ju&s;tly,
notwith&s;tanding them, Chri&s;tians may live in com|munion
together; and therefore urge them to
maintain the unity of the church, not to rent it,
not unnece&s;&s;arily to make a &s;chi&s;m or &s;eparation
from that profe&s;&s;ion which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
<PB N="204" REF="211">
country. But he mu&s;t: always carefully avoid
laying great &s;tre&s;s on party di&s;tinctions, and incul|cate
the far &s;uperior importance of real holine&s;s and
goodne&s;s. While he allows that they may be
&s;aved, notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;ent errors, which
they hold hone&s;tly and mi&s;take for truth, if they
be really holy; he mu&s;t inculcate on them,
that though they renounce the&s;e errors, though
their opinions be true in all re&s;pects, yet they can|not
be &s;aved without holine&s;s. Though he &s;hould
pro&s;elyte a thou&s;and to his own party, he mu&s;t
think that he has done nothing, till he make them
likewi&s;e truly religious and holy; for without this,
no man can be &s;aved in any religion. Better
per&s;uade one per&s;on to be truly holy, than bring
over ten thou&s;and to the pure&s;t &s;ect among
Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome ca&s;es, in which convincing, as
well as rebuking, cea&s;es to be a mini&s;ter's duty.
He mu&s;t always &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;e all notions
which directly tend to promote licentiou&s;ne&s;s and
vice, that if he cannot reclaim tho&s;e who have
embraced them, he may at lea&s;t prevent others
from being infected with them. But there are
many differences of opinion about le&s;&s;er matters,
which, as they are unavoidable, can &s;carce be &s;aid
to de&s;erve great regard. Be&s;ides, whenever per|&s;ons
are &s;o much under the power of prejudice, as
to be bigotted in their own way, all a mini&s;ter's
pains would be in vain. It will often happen, that
<PB N="205" REF="212">
all his arguments cannot convince tho&s;e with whom
he di&s;putes. When they are hone&s;t in their
belief, and live as becomes Chri&s;tians, he &s;hould
not, on this account, cea&s;e to treat them with the
greate&s;t kindne&s;s and regard; he will thus &s;how
them, that the love of truth, not de&s;ire of con|que&s;t,
was his motive in endeavouring to convince
them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of reconciling Differences.</HEAD>
<P>IT is often another duty incumbent on a mini&s;ter
to endeavour to reconcile differences, and extin|gui&s;h
animo&s;ities among his pari&s;hioners. Warm
benevolence will lead every good man to do his
utmo&s;t to promote peace and concord; and our
Saviour has &s;trongly recommended this exerci&s;e of
benevolence, by pronouncing &ldquo;the peace-makers
ble&s;&s;ed, for they,&endq; &s;ays he, &ldquo;&s;hall be called the
children of God<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 9.</NOTE>.&endq; It is indeed nece&s;&s;ary for
all men, but e&s;pecially for a mini&s;ter, becau&s;e the
con&s;equences of his giving &s;uch offence will be
wor&s;e, not to be forward or over-bu&s;y in meddling
in the affairs or quarrels of others. It often hap|pens,
that a per&s;on by this offends one, or, it may
<PB N="206" REF="213">
be, both parties; and if a mini&s;ter offend a per&s;on
by being thought to be partial again&s;t him, it will
probably be for ever out of his power to be u&s;eful
to him. For this rea&s;on, a mini&s;ter &s;hould always
avoid deciding the differences of his people, as a
judge or arbiter; for if either party &s;hould be di&s;|plea&s;ed
with his &s;entence, it will produce reflections
on his character for integrity; and the&s;e mu&s;t
always dimini&s;h his e&s;teem. All his endeavours to
reconcile differences mu&s;t be of a more private
nature, and in a way more &s;uited to his profe&s;&s;ion.
In addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to either party, without
blaming him as if he were ab&s;olutely in the wrong,
or even &s;uppo&s;ing him to be as much injured as he
thinks him&s;elf, he may yet inculcate the obligation
of forgivene&s;s, and di&s;play the beauty of placabi|lity.
And re&s;entment tends &s;o much to aggravate
the faults which are the objects of it, and makes
men &s;o unwilling to con&s;ider things in a fair light,
that we may almo&s;t promi&s;e, that if a mini&s;ter can
once convince the per&s;ons who are at variance,
that it is their duty to forgive, and bring them to
wi&s;h that they were able to practi&s;e it, and thus
awaken that general benevolence which re&s;entment
had extingui&s;hed, they will of them&s;elves perceive,
that their pa&s;&s;ions have repre&s;ented the grounds of
their difference as much more con&s;iderable than
they really are, and be almo&s;t a&s;hamed of their
di&s;&s;en&s;ion. Men often come to this when their
re&s;entment cools; and the only thing which pre|vents
their reconciliation is a &s;hyne&s;s to make the
<PB N="207" REF="214">
fir&s;t advances, or an uncertainty in each, whether
the other party be as much di&s;po&s;ed to it as him|&s;elf.
A mini&s;ter may often be of u&s;e to them in
this &s;ituation, by a&s;&s;uring them of each other's
good di&s;po&s;ition, and by u&s;ing other prudent
means of bringing them together.</P>

<P>Of Care of the Poor.</P>
<P>IT is incumbent on a mini&s;ter, to &s;earch out
the poor and indigent in his pari&s;h, and to contrive
means for &s;upplying them. While the idle, the
impudent, and clamorous poor make their ne|ce&s;&s;ities
known, and obtain relief, there are many
hone&s;t, mode&s;t, and indu&s;trious per&s;ons, who are
contented to pine in poverty and &s;traits, rather
than make their &s;ituation known, The&s;e are the
propere&s;t objects of charity, whom every pious
Chri&s;tian &s;hould &s;earch out, and relieve according
to his ability: but this is peculiarly the duty of a
mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Chri&s;tian church, when
the rich &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for the common &s;up|port
of the brethren, they brought the price to the
apo&s;tles, who took care of the di&s;tribution, accord|ing
to every man's need<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Acts, iv. 35.</NOTE>; and one of them, Peter,
<PB N="208" REF="215">
inflicted death on Ananias and Sapphira, for de|frauding
the poor<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Acts, v.</NOTE>. And though afterwards, when
the number of the di&s;ciples increa&s;ed, the apo&s;tles
appointed deacons to have the immediate care of
the poor, while they gave them&s;elves up wholly
&ldquo;to prayer and to the mini&s;try of the word<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Acts, vi. 4.</NOTE>;&endq;
yet we find that the apo&s;tles thought them&s;elves
&s;till obliged to intere&s;t them&s;elves very particularly
in obtaining provi&s;ion for the poor, on many differ|ent
occa&s;ions. Paul and Barnabas were careful to
carry relief, from the church at Antioch, to the
Chri&s;tians in Judea, in the pro&s;pect of the great
dearth of which Agabus had prophe&s;ied<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Acts, xi. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Paul
had not only undertaken the di&s;tribution of the
liberal charity, which the Macedonians had given
for the relief of the &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem, but like|wi&s;e
by their example, and by many other argu|ments,
he excites the Corinthians to contribute
largely for the &s;ame purpo&s;e<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If a mini&s;ter be a&s;&s;iduous in the practice of the
&s;everal duties which have been already explained,
he will thence derive great advantages for the di&s;|charge
of this duty. His conver&s;ing with his peo|ple
and in&s;tructing them in private, will give him
many opportunities of di&s;covering their &s;ituation,
without his &s;eeming to inquire into it. And his
<PB N="209" REF="216">
&s;howing all the concern he can, to &s;upply their
wants and mend their &s;ituation, will increa&s;e their
confidence in him, and add new authority and
weight to all his in&s;tructions and advices. They
will ea&s;ily believe that he &s;incerely wi&s;hes well to
their &s;ouls, who is anxious for their bodies, and
that all his exhortations proceed from his real
&s;en&s;e of their being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them.</P>
<P>There are many different ways which a mini&s;ter
may take, for &s;upplying the poor in his pari&s;h,
according to the variety of their rank and circum|&s;tances.
The&s;e he mu&s;t attend to with prudence;
otherwi&s;e, what he de&s;igns well, may offend and
irritate, by the manner in which it is be&s;towed.
There are &s;ome, whom he may all at once, with|out
any ceremony, either &s;upply out of his own
charity, as he is able, or recommend to the cha|ritable
funds of the pari&s;h. Many, who would
have been backward to apply for relief, will yet
readily and thankfully accept of it, even in this or|dinary
way, when it is procured to them without
its being a&s;ked. But many &s;tand really in need of
relief, who yet, on account of their rank or other
circum&s;tances, will not care to receive it in this
public way. To the&s;e, a mini&s;ter may &s;ometimes
convey his own charity privately. Sometimes he
may obtain for them relief, from per&s;ons who are
di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow, and able to be&s;tow more libe|rally
than he him&s;elf can afford, and who will,
either by him, or by other means, convey it to
<PB N="210" REF="217">
them in a private and inoffen&s;ive way. When a
mini&s;ter can neither afford him&s;elf to give, nor
procure from other private per&s;ons for them, that
relief which their &s;ituation demands; and when, at
the &s;ame time, they could not bear to be regarded
as objects of public charity, it may be po&s;&s;ible, in
&s;ome ca&s;es, for him to procure &s;omething from the
public charitable funds, to be privately be&s;towed
by him&s;elf. But this &s;hould not be often at|tempted.
Men are &s;o apt to mi&s;con&s;true the actions
of mini&s;ters, and it is of &s;o great moment that they
&s;hould not lie open to any &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;applying
charitable funds, that it will be generally mo&s;t pru|dent
for them not to de&s;ire to di&s;tribute any part
of them, but to per&s;ons whom they expre&s;sly name.
Individuals may, perhaps, &s;ometimes &s;uffer by this
re&s;erve; but by neglecting it, a mini&s;ter's own re|putation,
and con&s;equently his u&s;efulne&s;s, may be
wholly ruined. There are often per&s;ons in a pa|ri&s;h
who cannot be &s;aid to be indigent, or to &s;tand
in need of alms, who yet would often receive
great advantage by having the u&s;e of a little money
at particular junctures. A mini&s;ter may &s;ometimes
do important &s;ervice to whole families, by lending
&s;mall &s;ums, without intere&s;t, to &s;uch hone&s;t and
indu&s;trious per&s;ons, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in particular
emergencies, or to enable them to catch occa&s;ions
of profit. A man ought not indeed to &s;traiten his
own family in order to do this, and many mini&s;ters
are in &s;o narrow circum&s;tances, that they can &s;carcely
do it at all, without &s;traitening them. But, if a mi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="211" REF="218">
have a little money, he may, in this way, at
the expence of a very few &s;hillings, and with the
ri&s;k of a very few pounds, not only make &s;everal
families happy, but obtain both the love and e&s;teem
of many in his pari&s;h, and greatly increa&s;e his
power of being u&s;eful.</P>
<P>It is certainly the duty of a mini&s;ter, to take care
of the charitable funds of the pari&s;h, both that they
be pre&s;erved, and that they be well applied. The
want of knowlege in bu&s;ine&s;s may &s;ometimes lead
to errors in the former ca&s;e; but con&s;cience re|quires
that all po&s;&s;ible pains &s;hould be taken to
&s;upply that want by proper advice: to expo&s;e what
is given for the &s;upport of the poor, knowingly to
any ri&s;k of being lo&s;t, would be ba&s;e. In apply|ing
them, the leading principle &s;hould be, to cau&s;e
them to do as much good, relieve as much di&s;tre&s;s,
and promote as much happine&s;s, as po&s;&s;ible. If
this be kept in view, it will give direction in mo&s;t
of the particular ca&s;es which occur.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Private Duties re&s;pecting le&s;&s;er Societies.</HEAD>
<P>THE duties of a mini&s;ter which we have hi|therto
con&s;idered are, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e,
private, becau&s;e &s;eparate and di&s;tinct individuals
are the objects of them. There are other duties
of the pa&s;toral office which are of a private nature,
yet have bodies of men for their objects, or, at
lea&s;t, are, from their nature, performed in the pre|&s;ence
of families, or of a number together. We
&s;hall now proceed to the&s;e which are of a middle
kind between the mo&s;t private and the mo&s;t public
duties of the mini&s;terial office.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Vi&s;itation of Families.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t duty of this kind is Vi&s;itation of fami|lies,
when a mini&s;ter goes through his pari&s;h,
a&s;&s;embling each family by them&s;elves, or two or
three families together. In this round through his
pari&s;h, a mini&s;ter may do &s;everal things which are
extremely u&s;eful, and which this is the be&s;t op|portunity
of doing. At this time, a mini&s;ter forms
a roll or catalogue of his pari&s;hioners, according
<PB N="213" REF="220">
to which he calls them to be catechi&s;ed, and by
which he may know whether they all attend him.
This, of it&s;elf, is far from being u&s;ele&s;s, as it will
be a check on tho&s;e who, through a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of ignorance, an aver&s;ene&s;s to learn, or any other
bad principle, might be prone to avoid examina|tion.
At this time, likewi&s;e, a mini&s;ter may mo&s;t
conveniently obtain the knowlege of &s;trangers who
have come into his pari&s;h from other places, and
enquire into their characters and their atte&s;tations.
This will be often of u&s;e for preventing di&s;orderly
per&s;ons, who might corrupt others by their vices,
from &s;ettling in a pari&s;h. As our Saviour, when
he &s;ent forth, fir&s;t, his twelve apo&s;tles, and after|wards,
the &s;eventy di&s;ciples, to preach the go&s;pel,
commanded them, into whatever hou&s;e they went,
to &s;ay, &ldquo;Peace be to this hou&s;e;&endq; &s;o a mini&s;ter
ought to join with his vi&s;it to any family, &s;incere
devotion and earne&s;t prayer, particularly for the
&s;piritual and temporal happine&s;s of that family.
A mini&s;ter may likewi&s;e render this part of his
labour &s;ub&s;ervient to other good purpo&s;es, particu|larly
to recommending &s;uch duties as are properly
economical, or relative to a family. This will be
a proper opportunity of in&s;tructing them in the
nature, and exciting them to the practice, of all
the relative duties. He may enquire how the
hu&s;band and wife behave to each other, give them
directions for the practice of their &s;everal duties,
point out to them many faults of conduct, which
would not perhaps have been attended to by them|&s;elves,
<PB N="214" REF="221">
which yet are both tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of their
duty, and will dimini&s;h their happine&s;s in each
other, and their authority in the family. He may
examine the ma&s;ters and the &s;ervants, how they
treat each other, direct the former to kindne&s;s,
and the latter to obedience and fidelity. He may
inculcate on parents the obligation of taking care
of the virtuous education of their children, give
them familiar directions about the right manner
of it, warn them again&s;t the faults that are gene|rally
fallen into, &s;how them the nece&s;&s;ity of train|ing
them to indu&s;try, and fitting them for &s;ome
lawful calling. He &s;hould recommend family re|ligion,
particularly the reading of the &s;criptures,
and in&s;pecting the behaviour of all within the
hou&s;e. A vi&s;it to a family is one of the propere&s;t
opportunities of giving in&s;tructions, exhortations,
Or reproofs, on &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e.</P>
<P>It happens often, e&s;pecially in country pari&s;hes,
that &s;everal families are convened together. In
this ca&s;e, be&s;ides what has been already mentioned,
a mini&s;ter has a fit opportunity of enquiring, on
what terms they live with one another, of examin|ing
into the grounds of any differences which pre|vail
among them, and into the occa&s;ions, which,
from their &s;ituation, produce di&s;putes more fre|quently
among them; and he may contribute
greatly to e&s;tabli&s;h good neighbourhood and har|mony,
by directing them how to avoid the&s;e con|tentions,
by reconciling their differences, and urg|ing
<PB N="215" REF="222">
the obligation of Chri&s;tian concord. This may
likewi&s;e be a fit opportunity of exciting them to
brotherly admonition. As it is the duty, not only
of mini&s;ters, but of all Chri&s;tians, to exhort one
another on proper occa&s;ions, a mini&s;ter may direct
neighbours to keep an eye on the conduct of each
other, to admoni&s;h each other privately whenever
they find one another guilty of a fault, or wanting
in any duty. By this means, they may be ren|dered
u&s;eful monitors to each other; the more
knowing may contribute to the in&s;truction of the
ignorant, and the regular and virtuous to the
amendment of tho&s;e who are not &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed.
A mini&s;ter may render vi&s;itation of families &s;till
farther u&s;eful, by accompanying it with catechi&s;ing.
This might make it tedious and laborious in very
large and populous pari&s;hes; but in &s;mall pari&s;hes,
and even in all except the very large&s;t, it may be
ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed in &s;o moderate a time as no
man will grudge, who enters into the &s;pirit of his
employment. By this means, a pari&s;h may be
catechi&s;ed twice, with very little additional trouble
to the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Vi&s;iting families begins to be neglected by &s;ome
mini&s;ters, as a le&s;s u&s;eful part of their employment;
but they who neglect it, &s;eem not to attend to the
good purpo&s;es to which it may be rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient.
It &s;eems to be naturally implied in teach|ing
&ldquo;from hou&s;e to hou&s;e;&endq; it is expre&s;sly en|joined
by the laws of our church; and a mini&s;ter
<PB N="216" REF="223">
who fir&s;t performs it, or thinks of performing it
in &s;o carele&s;s and formal a manner as to render it
u&s;ele&s;s, and then neglects it becau&s;e he finds it
u&s;ele&s;s, is plainly wanting in his duty, and omits
one thing, by which he might, in a great degree,
and in &s;ome peculiar ways, promote the good of
his people. This part of a mini&s;ter's work &s;hould
generally be performed once every year; and that
&s;ea&s;on &s;hould be cho&s;en for it when the people are
mo&s;t at home, when they are lea&s;t engaged in
work, and can attend with lea&s;t inconvenience;
a &s;ea&s;on of this &s;ort in the &s;ummer will be mo&s;t
commodious for the mini&s;ter, who is obliged to
go through the whole pari&s;h. As the intermi&s;&s;ions
of labour are not very long, a mini&s;ter &s;hould con|trive,
as much as po&s;&s;ible, to vi&s;it his whole pari&s;h
during the continuance of them; but he &s;hould,
at the &s;ame time, not hurry it &s;o much, as to oblige
him to go through it in a &s;uperficial or merely
formal way. If a pari&s;h be &s;o very large, as to
render it nece&s;&s;ary, either to vi&s;it it ha&s;tily, or to
encroach upon the bu&s;y &s;ea&s;ons of the year, it may
be proper, either to vi&s;it the whole pari&s;h, in the
way we have de&s;cribed, one year, and catechi&s;e,
without vi&s;iting it, the next; or, every year to
vi&s;it one half, and catechi&s;e the other.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Catechi&s;ing.</HEAD>
<P>THIS brings us to the next duty, Catechi&s;ing.
This has been con&s;idered in all ages as the propere&s;t
method of communicating the knowlege of every
&s;ubject. A particular &s;pecies of it was the only
method which Socrates u&s;ed for either confuting
errors, or leading men to the knowlege of the
truth. It is plain from &s;cripture, that this method
was u&s;ed for bringing converts to the knowlege of
the go&s;pel. Luke tells Theophilus, that he wrote
his go&s;pel on purpo&s;e that he &ldquo;might know the
certainty of tho&s;e things wherein he had been
<HI>in&s;tructed;</HI>&endq; it is in the greek, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
wherein he had been <HI>catechi&s;ed,</HI> or in&s;tructed by
catechi&s;ing<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Luke, i. 4.</NOTE>. It is &s;aid, that Apollos was &ldquo;<HI>in|&s;tructed</HI>
in the way of the Lord<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Acts, xviii. 25.</NOTE>;&endq; the greek
word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ignified initiated, or informed
by catechi&s;ing. As this is indeed one of the pro|pere&s;t
methods of in&s;tructing, e&s;pecially the young
and the ignorant, it is to be con&s;idered as recom|mended
by all the exhortations which are given
mini&s;ters to &ldquo;teach.&endq; We know that it has been
always u&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian church, and that con|verts
<PB N="218" REF="225">
to Chri&s;tianity were, by this method, very
carefully in&s;tructed in the nature of that religion,
before they were baptized, and on this account
were, during the time that pa&s;&s;ed before their
bapti&s;m, called Catechumens. This method of
in&s;truction has many advantages. It keeps up the
attention much better than a continued di&s;cour&s;e.
It gives opportunity of ob&s;erving how far a &s;ubject
is under&s;tood, and of illu&s;trating it till it be under|&s;tood.
It tends to make things better retained.
It &s;erves to explain tho&s;e terms which often occur
in preaching, and which, however familiar they
may be to the preacher, might be dark to many of
the hearers, or be mi&s;under&s;tood by them; and
will thus prove an excellent preparation for their
attending to &s;ermons with under&s;tanding and
advantage. But its obligation and utility will
be ea&s;ily acknowleged; it is more nece&s;&s;ary to
con&s;ider the be&s;t manner of performing it.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned, that, catechi&s;ing
may be very properly joined with vi&s;itation of
families; not that, when it is thus joined, it &s;hould
be thought &s;ufficient. It ought to be likewi&s;e per|formed
by it&s;elf. Sometimes a mini&s;ter may find it
convenient to do this likewi&s;e, by a&s;&s;embling &s;everal
families together in their own neighbourhood;
but generally it is mo&s;t convenient to call them to
the church, or to his own hou&s;e; the fatigue of
coming once is incon&s;iderable to each of them,
whereas it would be a great toil for him to go
<PB N="219" REF="226">
through them all. The winter months, when they
are little taken up with their bu&s;ine&s;s, will be gene|rally
found mo&s;t convenient for this, and are for
the mo&s;t part cho&s;en. It is &s;ometimes, too, eli|gible
to &s;pend a part of Sunday afternoon in cate|chi&s;ing,
e&s;pecially in the &s;pring, immediately before
afternoon &s;ermon be begun, and in autumn, imme|diately
after it is given over. A great many
can then attend without any interruption to their
work, and receive at lea&s;t, from hearing others
examined, &s;ome in&s;truction in the principles of
religion.</P>
<P>It is by no means &s;ufficient, that the people be
able to &s;ay a catechi&s;m by rote; they are perfectly
ignorant till they know the meaning of all the
words and propo&s;itions in it; and the ab&s;urd an|&s;wers
which the common people often give to the
que&s;tions of the mo&s;t common catechi&s;m, &s;how
that they may have the whole by heart, without
really under&s;tanding any part of the &s;ubject of it.
A mini&s;ter's chief care therefore ought to be, to
bring them, not to repeat, but to under&s;tand the
catechi&s;m; and this may be done almo&s;t with the
&s;tupide&s;t, by means of plain explications and ea&s;y
illu&s;trations. An&s;wering to the que&s;tions of a
catechi&s;m &s;hould not be made a mere exerci&s;e of
memory; it may be no more, even when they
under&s;tand what they repeat. It &s;hould be made,
as much as po&s;&s;ible, an exerci&s;e of judgment. In
order to this, &s;uch que&s;tions &s;hould be put, as may
<PB N="220" REF="227">
lead them gradually to di&s;cover of them&s;elves, and
to give, in their own words the an&s;wer which they
&s;hould have given, and about which they were at
a lo&s;s. This method of leading men, by well-con|trived
que&s;tions, from &s;ome ea&s;y and known prin|ciple
to the di&s;covery which we want them to make,
is properly the Socratic method of in&s;truction. It
requires &s;ome genius and dexterity in the que&s;tioner
to pur&s;ue this method on any &s;ubject; but if he be
capable of it, it will render catechi&s;ing an agree|able
and entertaining exerci&s;e to him&s;elf; whereas,
in the way it is commonly managed, it is a dry and
tedious labour. It will likewi&s;e be highly profit|able
for the learner. It will make tho&s;e who&s;e
memory is naturally weak, to attain almo&s;t as
much real knowlege, as they who have &s;tronger
memories: it will render their conceptions di&s;tinct
and determinate: and when they are thus led to
deduce all their knowlege from ea&s;y principles,
conviction will nece&s;&s;arily attend all their concep|tions.
They will comprehend religion, and, at the
&s;ame time, perceive the truth of its &s;everal parts.
This manner of examination which we propo&s;e,
will probably be ea&s;ily comprehended by all of you,
however difficult it may &s;ometimes be to reduce it
to practice.</P>
<P>It is a fault in mo&s;t catechi&s;ms, that they abound
too much in technical and &s;y&s;tematic terms. This
is one great occa&s;ion both of people's getting them
merely by rote, and of their not under&s;tanding
<PB N="221" REF="228">
them. It were much better that the&s;e terms were
confined altogether to controver&s;ial writings, and
u&s;ed neither in &s;ermons nor in catechi&s;ms. But as
they are often u&s;ed in both, they &s;hould, in cate|chi&s;ing,
be explained in as ea&s;y and familiar a
manner as po&s;&s;ible, that, when they occur in
preaching, they may not be unintelligible. It is
likewi&s;e a fault in mo&s;t catechi&s;ms, that the prin|ciples
of religion, and the precepts of it, are kept
too much di&s;tinct, and laid down in different parts.
By this means the practical tendency of the chri&s;tian
doctrines does not appear; their connection with
holine&s;s is not pointed out; the duties of religion
are explained, but they are not enforced by the
proper motives. The&s;e inconveniences &s;hould be
remedied in catechi&s;ing. No que&s;tion relating to
any doctrine of religion &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with|out
&s;howing its influence on practice, and the
force with which it recommends holine&s;s. In
examining, again, on every que&s;tion relating to
duty, the peculiar obligations of that duty &s;hould
be brought into view. All this may be accom|pli&s;hed
by proper que&s;tions put in the way that we
have already de&s;cribed. But with the&s;e, it will be
very proper, that a mini&s;ter frequently intermix
&s;hort exhortations to the due improvement of the
principles of religion, by the careful practice of
every duty.</P>
<P>It is but a &s;mall part of a catechi&s;m that a mini|&s;ter
can a&s;k at every particular per&s;on; yet the
<PB N="222" REF="229">
de&s;ign of catechi&s;ing is to in&s;truct per&s;ons in the
whole &s;cheme of religion. In order to effect this,
a mini&s;ter mu&s;t call as many together to be cate|chi&s;ed,
as he can go through, without either ren|dering
the examination of each &s;uperficial, or immo|derately
fatiguing him&s;elf. The increa&s;e of labour
at every particular meeting will be compen&s;ated, in
&s;ome degree, by the &s;maller number of meetings.
He mu&s;t endeavour at each meeting to go through
the whole catechi&s;m; by which means, all who
are pre&s;ent may be in&s;tructed in all the parts of
religion. In order to make room for this, it will
be proper to pa&s;s &s;lightly over &s;uch things as are of
le&s;&s;er moment, and to dwell chiefly on tho&s;e things
of which the people &s;eem mo&s;t ignorant, or which
are of greate&s;t importance, and mo&s;t immediately
connected with practice.</P>
<P>The duty of catechi&s;ing &s;hould be diligently
practi&s;ed, e&s;pecially with regard to the young. It
is by this means that they can be&s;t learn the great
articles of the chri&s;tian religion: if they do not
learn them then, they will &s;carce ever learn them
thoroughly; but if they then learn them, they will
keep a fa&s;t hold of them to the end of their lives.
It is with the young that mo&s;t benefit may be
expected from it; their minds are open to truth,
and pliable to goodne&s;s; on tho&s;e who are already
confirmed either in ignorance or in vice, it cannot
be expected that &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion will be
made.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Fellow&s;hip Meetings.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall next make a few ob&s;ervations on a
cu&s;tom which prevails in &s;ome places, but is not
univer&s;al, that of holding fellow&s;hip meetings. It
cannot be doubted, that meetings of private
Chri&s;tians, either among them&s;elves, or with their
mini&s;ter, if they were managed aright, and judi|ciou&s;ly
employed in devotion and in exciting one
another to love and good works, might be attended
with very con&s;iderable advantages. But at the
&s;ame time it is plain from experience, that they
have &s;eldom been managed aright, and that they
have in fact generally been attended with real
inconvenience. They are too much confined, as
all who choo&s;e are not admitted to them, though
their morals may be unexceptionable. They are
chiefly compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who are di&s;po&s;ed to
idlene&s;s, and think they cannot mind religion,
without neglecting their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s and many
of the &s;ocial duties of life; of &s;uch per&s;ons as are
conceited of their knowlege, on account of their
dipping into ab&s;tru&s;e and di&s;putable &s;ubjects, or of
their peculiar &s;anctity, on account of the orthodoxy
of their opinions; of &s;uch per&s;ons as place almo&s;t
the whole of religion in a punctual ob&s;ervance
of the ceremonial duties of it, and thus &s;ub&s;titute
<PB N="224" REF="231">
&s;uper&s;tition in the place of holine&s;s; of &s;uch per|&s;ons
as are under the influence of a weak and igno|rant
enthu&s;ia&s;m; and, in a word, of &s;uch as think
they derive great merit from their attending &s;uch
meetings, and on that account regard them&s;elves as
the only godly per&s;ons, and de&s;pi&s;e others, who
are perhaps much better and more virtuous than
they. The con&s;equence of per&s;ons of &s;uch cha|racters
meeting together is generally to promote
their &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition, to fo&s;ter their enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
to flatter their hypocri&s;y, to cheri&s;h their
conceit and &s;piritual pride, and their phari&s;aical
contempt of others. When they are met, the
&s;pirit that reigns in them will make their conver|&s;ation
tend rather to pervert, than to improve,
their religious &s;entiments: their &s;pirit, joined with
their ignorance, will render their devotions often
full of ab&s;urdities and extravagance. This has
been &s;o generally the effect of the&s;e meetings, the
abu&s;e, of them has been &s;o frequent, that it appears
to me, they &s;hould rather be &s;hunned upon the
whole, than courted by a mini&s;ter. If they have
not been cu&s;tomary in his pari&s;h, it will be better
not to introduce them. All the good effects that
could be expected from them will be much more
certainly and more effectually promoted by the
occa&s;ional private in&s;tructions and exhortations
which we have formerly recommended, and by
exciting tho&s;e who live in the &s;ame neighbourhood
to conver&s;e about religion, and admoni&s;h each
other, in the way that we have already hinted.
<PB N="225" REF="232">
and they will be promoted by this means, without
the danger of tho&s;e abu&s;es which have often ari&s;en
from formal meetings. If a mini&s;ter find that
meetings of this &s;ort have been already introduced
into his pari&s;h, it can &s;eldom be prudent to attempt
to di&s;courage, or to aboli&s;h them, all at once.
This would only irritate the people, and in a great
mea&s;ure de&s;troy the mini&s;ter's u&s;efulne&s;s. If he
&s;hould refu&s;e to attend them, the people would
hold them by them&s;elves, and be apt to proceed
to a greater height of extravagance, than if he
were pre&s;ent. He ought therefore to &s;et him&s;elf
to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch regulations, as may tend to pre|vent
the abu&s;es of them, and render them &s;ub&s;er|vient
to a good purpo&s;e. He &s;hould take care to
be always pre&s;ent at them him&s;elf. He &s;hould
appoint them to be held at &s;uch times as may not
interfere, either with their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, or
with other duties. He &s;hould take care that they
be not confined to a particular &s;et of people of a
phari&s;aical &s;pirit, but that all who are unexcep|tionable
in their morals have free acce&s;s to them.
He &s;hould take care that all &s;ubjects to be di&s;cour&s;ed
on be propo&s;ed at a previous meeting. He &s;hould
hinder every &s;ubject from being introduced, that
tends to lead men into u&s;ele&s;s &s;peculations, intri|cate
di&s;putes, or &s;uper&s;titious and enthu&s;ia&s;tical
notions. He &s;hould allow only &s;uch &s;ubjects to be
introduced, as have a real tendency to make men
wi&s;er and better, by either explaining or enforcing
the duties of religion; and he ought to lead them
<PB N="226" REF="233">
to con&s;ider them in tho&s;e views in which they
tend mo&s;t &s;trongly to produce this effect, and to
keep them to this way of Con&s;idering them. He
&s;hould recommend it to the people to con&s;ider the
&s;ubject carefully by them&s;elves, before they venture
to &s;peak on it in the pre&s;ence of others. When
any of them vent any thing ab&s;urd or enthu&s;ia&s;tic,
they &s;hould be immediately checked and corrected.
None &s;hould pray, but tho&s;e who are de&s;ired by
the mini&s;ter; and when they utter any thing extra|vagant
in prayer, it &s;hould not only be pointed out
to them, but they &s;hould be hindered from attempt|ing
it again for &s;ome time, till they learn to think
more &s;oberly and ju&s;tly. The mini&s;ter &s;hould
always be careful to inculcate on them, that they
are no better than their neighbours merely for
attending the&s;e meetings; that they are only u&s;eful
&s;o far as they are means of rendering them more
virtuous in their ordinary conduct. By &s;uch
means as che&s;e, a mini&s;ter of prudence may, in a
great mea&s;ure, prevent the abu&s;e of fellow&s;hip
meetings, and turn them to real advantage: and
when he finds that they are already introduced into
a pari&s;h, and that the people are fond of them, it
will generally be better to model them, in this way,
into an u&s;eful form, than to attempt aboli&s;hing
them altogether.</P>

<P>To the&s;e duties we may add Marrying; but
it will not require many words. It is by law
committed to mini&s;ters, and from its &s;olemn and
important nature, there are good rea&s;ons why it
&s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>It is their duty to do all they can to prevent
marriages in any way improper, by advice and
per&s;ua&s;ion. If the&s;e prove ineffectual, and if the
impropriety lie only in &s;ome imprudence, or &s;ome
inequality between the parties, the mini&s;ter mu&s;t
allow them to judge for them&s;elves; to refu&s;e to
marry them, would be a&s;&s;uming an authority to
which he has no right. But there may be impro|prieties
of &s;uch a kind and degree, as to ju&s;tify or
even require this; for in&s;tance, if one of the
parties be under age, and plainly drawn in by the
art of the other, it would be a ju&s;t reflection on a
mini&s;ter to &s;olemnize their marriage. Some mar|riages
are &s;o confe&s;&s;edly unlawful, that not to
refu&s;e ab&s;olutely to celebrate them would be highly
criminal.</P>
<P>A mini&s;ter may be &s;ometimes de&s;ired to cele|brate
marriages which are in them&s;elves unexcep|tionable,
<PB N="228" REF="235">
in an irregular manner, or without the
ordinary forms of proclamation. There no doubt
are ca&s;es in which the omi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e cannot be
attended with any bad con&s;equences. Yet it is
&s;afe&s;t for a mini&s;ter &s;teadily to adhere to them.
There can never almo&s;t be a good rea&s;on for &s;eek|ing
to di&s;pen&s;e with them; it is a caprice which
de&s;erves no encouragement; it it really penal,
though there may be no danger of the penalty
being actually demanded. Such ca&s;es may be
pleaded as a precedent for his conduct in others,
where it is not &s;o clear that bad con&s;equences may
not follow; and by refu&s;ing in the&s;e, he incurs the
charge of incon&s;i&s;tence and partiality, or by com|plying,
does what he thinks improper, or even
hazardous.</P>
<P>The form of marriage includes &s;ome in&s;tructions
concerning its nature and duties, and the marriage

<P>IF the &s;everal private duties, re&s;pecting both
individuals and &s;ocieties, which we have hitherto
illu&s;trated, be really incumbent on a mini&s;ter, it
<PB N="229" REF="236">
will follow, that whatever is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
to the performance of them is in the &s;ame degree
incumbent on him, and that he is under &s;ome
obligation to whatever can contribute to his per|forming
them in the be&s;t manner. Hence are de|rived
&s;everal &s;econdary or &s;ubordinate duties of the
pa&s;toral office, the con&s;ideration of which will
&s;erve for a proper conclu&s;ion of this part of the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them is con&s;tant re&s;idence. If there
be no expre&s;s command in &s;cripture, impo&s;ing this
as a nece&s;&s;ary duty, the rea&s;on is admitted even by
the Popi&s;h ca&s;ui&s;ts to be, that the nature of the
office implies it, becau&s;e it cannot be executed
without it; and every pa&s;tor being obliged to ex|ecute
his office, is of cour&s;e obliged to re&s;idence
as indi&s;pen&s;able for that purpo&s;e. In the primitive
ages, the pa&s;tors of every church re&s;ided in it, ex|cept
when they were driven away by per&s;ecution;
and even by this they were not ea&s;ily prevailed
upon to de&s;ert it. In the original e&s;tabli&s;hment of
parochial churches in every nation, the incumbents
were looked upon as &s;trictly obliged to re&s;ide; and
it was on the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being &s;o, that
glebes and hou&s;es were provided for them, in order
to render their re&s;idence commodious. After cor|ruptions
in religion began to prevail, pa&s;tors &s;ome|times
indulged them&s;elves in ab&s;ence from their
charges, for taking care of &s;ome worldly occupa|tions
in which they were engaged, or for attend|ance
<PB N="230" REF="237">
at the courts of emperors and kings: and in
the farther progre&s;s of the&s;e corruptions, the &s;ame
per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of two or more churches
or pari&s;hes, in one only of which he could re|&s;ide.
The&s;e practices were, however, very ge|nerally
condemned as gro&s;s abu&s;es; and, from
their fir&s;t appearance, even prohibited by the ca|nons
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive councils. The&s;e canons began,
in cour&s;e of time, to admit &s;ome exceptions; fir&s;t,
by allowing one man to hold two churches when
a &s;ufficient number of fit per&s;ons could not be
found for providing each with a &s;eparate pa&s;tor;
next, when one church was &s;o poor as not to
afford a competent and &s;ufficient maintenance;
afterwards for rea&s;ons far le&s;s rea&s;onable, as in fa|vour
of per&s;ons of high birth, or eminently learned,
or dignified in Univer&s;ities, who, on di&s;pen&s;ations
being granted by the Pope, might hold a plurality
of benefices. By means of the&s;e exceptions, along
with the facility of procuring di&s;pen&s;ations, the
abu&s;e ro&s;e to &s;o great a height, that many remote
benefices were often accumulated in one per&s;on;
for remedying which, the Council of Trent made
&s;everal decrees; and though the&s;e did not take
away all di&s;pen&s;ations, they have rendered appli|cations
for them, and con&s;equently both non-re&s;i|dence
and pluralities, le&s;s frequent in the church
of Rome than they formerly were. In England,
a law had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time before that council,
and before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Reformation,
which, by admitting the exceptions introduced in
<PB N="231" REF="238">
the mo&s;t corrupt ages, gave them a &s;anction in
that church: and it has never been formally re|pealed.
Under the authority of it, non-re&s;idence,
on account of pluralities as well as on other pre|tences,
continues to prevail; though it has always
been condemned by many, and pronounced to be
contrary to the declared &s;en&s;e of the church, parti|cularly
in its public offices, and unju&s;tifiable in
point of con&s;cience<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccle&s;. Ca&s;. 1. p. 23. Ca&s;. 2. p. 158. Ca&s;. 3.

&s;ometimes a longer time: but even &s;uch induce|ments
&s;hould be complied with &s;paringly, not ea|gerly
catched at. Without living much at home,
a mini&s;ter cannot perform the &s;everal duties of his
office, which recur almo&s;t every day, in &s;uch a
manner, as can either give full &s;atisfaction to his
own mind, or yield the greate&s;t benefit to his
people. To wander often abroad on needle&s;s vi&s;its
or amu&s;ement, expo&s;es a mini&s;ter to the contempt
of his people, alienates their affections, and impairs

procure relief for the indigent, to an&s;wer quickly

<P>On the &s;ame principles it is the duty of a mi|ni&s;ter,
to keep him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible di&s;en|gaged
from all occupations except tho&s;e belonging
to his office: for the proper and careful perform|ance
of its duties, together with the &s;tudies requi|&s;ite
for that purpo&s;e, and the attention which his
own worldly affairs render indi&s;pen&s;able, will be
&s;ufficient to fill up all his time. No doubt there
are ca&s;es which ought to be excepted. Teaching
in any u&s;eful line is congenial to the proper bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of a clergyman; &s;ome clergymen are well
qualified for it, and in &s;ituations which put it in
their power; and by engaging in it no farther than
is really con&s;i&s;tent with all their pa&s;toral duties,
they may not only innocently render their condi|tion
more comfortable, but employ their time
<PB N="233" REF="240">
laudably, improve them&s;elves, be highly u&s;eful to
&s;ociety, and even be kept more con&s;tantly at hand
for attendance upon their parochial functions. If
a clergyman under&s;tand medicine, he may prac|ti&s;e
it in his neighbourhood to a certain degree,
without drawing him off from the&s;e functions:
and by this may not only better his circum&s;tances,
and do much good to the bodies of men, but al&s;o
give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;uch as could not otherwi&s;e have
procured it, multiply his opportunities of addre&s;&s;|ing
his people as a mini&s;ter, and render them well
di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es on &s;ubjects of re|ligion.
Some degree of attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, par|ticularly
in the way of agriculture, the &s;ituation of
mo&s;t clergymen renders nece&s;&s;ary: but it can never
be proper to extend it beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary.
If they engage &s;o far in any &s;ecular employment
as to be immer&s;ed in it, they cannot have lei&s;ure
for all the duties which are incumbent on them,
they will contract a turn of mind unfavourable to
their always entering heartily into them, and there
is a ri&s;k, that it may put them on doing &s;ome
things which will not be deemed perfectly con&s;i&s;t|ent
with the purity and dignity of their character,
and which will, on that account, render them le&s;s
acceptable and u&s;eful in their proper &s;tation<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccle&s;. Ca&s;. 2. p. 157.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That a mini&s;ter may perform the &s;everal duties
which we have enumerated, it is plainly nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="234" REF="241">
for him to be often in the company of his people,
and to live in familiarity with them: and his per|forming
the&s;e duties, on all fit occa&s;ions, when he
is in their company, will prevent all bad con&s;e|quences
from his familiarity. To be often in their
company, joining in their amu&s;ements, falling in
with the trifling, or conniving at the blameable
conver&s;ation in which they frequently engage, will
very ea&s;ily produce an exce&s;&s;ive familiarity of the
wor&s;t tendency. It cannot fail to de&s;troy that re|&s;pect
and e&s;teem which it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
him to maintain, in order to give weight to his
mini&s;trations. But when, in&s;tead of that, he takes
every opportunity of introducing u&s;eful conver&s;a|tion,
of enlarging and correcting their knowlege,
of exciting them to their duty and directing them
in it, of giving them con&s;olation, of doing them
good offices; he may be very often in their com|pany,
not only without breeding any inconvenient
familiarity, but &s;o as to rai&s;e their e&s;teem, and in|crea&s;e
their love to him. If &s;ome of them &s;hould
have even entertained prejudices again&s;t him, he
will, by this means, mo&s;t effectually wear them
off: when they find him thus &s;olicitous for their
improvement and &s;alvation, they will drop them of
their own accord, and labour to make amends for
them, by the warmth of their affection.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Preaching.</HEAD>
<P>AS we are now come to the public duties of the
pa&s;toral office, we &s;hall begin with Preaching,
both becau&s;e it will require a fuller con&s;ideration than
the re&s;t, and becau&s;e, being one very con&s;iderable
mean of in&s;truction, it is neare&s;t akin to the pri|vate
duties, which we have hitherto chiefly illu&s;|trated.
Preaching is &s;o natural a method of teach|ing,
is &s;o often enjoined in the New Te&s;tament,
and is &s;o fully recommended by the example of
our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, that it has always
been acknowleged an important part of the office
of a mini&s;ter; and therefore it will be unnece&s;&s;ary
to &s;pend time in proving that it is incumbent on
him. Nor do we propo&s;e to lay before you a
complete &s;y&s;tem of the rules of preaching, de|duced
from the general principles of compo&s;ition,
or traced up to their &s;ource in the con&s;titution of
human nature. We &s;hall content our&s;elves with
propo&s;ing &s;ome of the principal rules of it, in
&s;uch a way as may both convince you of their
<PB N="236" REF="243">
ju&s;tne&s;s, and render them ea&s;ily applicable to prac|tice.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not attempt any preci&s;e general defini|tion
of Preaching; it might be difficult to contrive
one which would fully take in all its varieties; and
the con&s;ideration of the&s;e varieties will &s;uper&s;ede
the nece&s;&s;ity of it. It is plain that Preaching is the
delivering a di&s;cour&s;e, which tends to promote the
&s;alvation of mankind, by in&s;tructing them in the
knowlege of their duty, and exciting them to the
practice of it, and to the love of goodne&s;s. This
being its de&s;ign, &ldquo;it is certainly,&endq; to u&s;e the
words of Bi&s;hop Burnet, &ldquo;a noble and profitable
exerci&s;e, if rightly gone about; of great u&s;e both
to the prie&s;t and people, by obliging the one to
much &s;tudy and labour, and by &s;etting before
the other full and copious di&s;coveries of divine
matters, opening them clearly, and pre&s;&s;ing
them weightily upon them. It has al&s;o now
gained &s;uch e&s;teem in the world, that a clergy|man
cannot maintain his credit, nor bring his
people to a con&s;tant attendance on the wor&s;hip
of God, unle&s;s he is happy in the&s;e perform|ances<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Pa&s;toral Care, ch. ix.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The general end of Preaching, the promoting
the religious and moral improvement of man|kind,
all preachers have profe&s;&s;ed to aim at,
though they have taken very different methods,
<PB N="237" REF="244">
and the fa&s;hion of Preaching has, like all other
fa&s;hions, undergone many changes. In the be|ginning
of Chri&s;tianity, Preaching was extremely
&s;imple; it con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t wholly of plain practical
exhortations; it has &s;ince been &s;ometimes joined
with all the ornaments of rhetoric, and &s;ometimes
with all the &s;ubtlety of &s;chola&s;tic philo&s;ophy. In
the dark ages, it was little el&s;e than panegyric on
the Romi&s;h &s;aints: after the Reformation, it was
employed about the doctrines and duties of reli|gion,
but with too great a mixture of controver&s;y:
the &s;everal changes which it has &s;ince undergone,
may be traced in the &s;ermons to which there is ea&s;y
acce&s;s. It would be curious and entertaining to
trace it through the various forms it has a&s;&s;umed,
and to point out its mo&s;t con&s;iderable revolutions.
But a complete hi&s;tory of this would be long; and
&s;o far as it is either nece&s;&s;ary or proper to hint at it,
we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to take notice of &s;ome of
the mo&s;t remarkable forms of Preaching, in illu&s;|trating
its particular rules.</P>
<P>Preaching is one &s;ort of public &s;peaking; the
eloquence of the pulpit is one branch of eloquence.
A preacher differs from one who &s;peaks in the
&s;enate or at the bar, only in the &s;ubject which he
treats, and in the end which he pur&s;ues. The&s;e
differences will occa&s;ion &s;ome varieties in the man|ner
of &s;peaking which he is to u&s;e; but &s;till the
peculiar rules of Preaching ari&s;e from the general
<PB N="238" REF="245">
principles of eloquence, the &s;ame principles which
are the &s;ource of all other &s;orts of compo&s;ition.
A particular compari&s;on of the eloquence of the
pulpit with that of the bar or the &s;enate, in order
to di&s;cover their agreements and their differences,
would be curious, and might illu&s;trate all of them;
but it is not &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent
de&s;ign, as to require our entering on a full di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion
of it. We &s;hall only remark in general, that
on account of their agreements and analogy,
many of the rules laid down by the ancients for
the bar of the &s;enate, are applicable to the pulpit;
but in applying them to it, judgement mu&s;t be
employed, on account of the circum&s;tances in
which they differ. It would be ea&s;y, from the
compari&s;on we have hinted at, to deduce the &s;upe|rior
importance of chri&s;tian oratory to all other
kinds, both in re&s;pect of its &s;ubject and its end;
to point out the advantages which the chri&s;tian
orator has above all others, from the &s;ublimity and
moment of the topics on which he in&s;i&s;ts, and of
the motives which he urges; and to &s;how the di&s;ad|vantages
under which he lies, in compari&s;on with
others, particularly from the &s;piritual nature of the
&s;ubjects on which he in&s;i&s;ts, and from its being his
bu&s;ine&s;s to excite men, not to &s;ome one action,
which may be performed immediately, but to a
general cour&s;e of behaviour. But the&s;e things you
will be able to pro&s;ecute, if you find it nece&s;&s;ary,
by your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="246">
The ancient rhetoricians di&s;tingui&s;hed orations
into three kinds, the nature and rules of which
they delivered very particularly: 1. Deliberative,
which were employed about &s;omething future,
about what was to be done; and for the&s;e, there
were frequent opportunities in the &s;enate and
popular a&s;&s;emblies in Greece and Rome, where
public mea&s;ures were concerted and re&s;olved upon.
Such orations aimed either at <HI>per&s;uading</HI> to, or
<HI>di&s;&s;uading</HI> from, certain actions or conduct; and
the topics on which they turned were, the honour
or di&s;honour, the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice, the advantage
or di&s;advantage, of the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed. Many
&s;ermons might be reduced to this cla&s;s; all &s;uch as
aim at per&s;uading to virtue in general, or to any
particular virtue, from its obligations, its excel|lence,
its advantages here and hereafter, or at di&s;|&s;uading
from vice, by the oppo&s;ite topics. 2. Judi|cial,
which regarded the pa&s;t, and belonged to
the criminal courts; they were employed in accu|&s;ing
or in defending, and made u&s;e both of facts
and arguments for the&s;e purpo&s;es. Sermons which
are employed in defending any character approved
in &s;cripture from objections that have been rai&s;ed
again&s;t it, are of the &s;ame kind with judicial
orations. So are all &s;ermons, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to vindicate religion in general,
or any particular doctrine or duty which has been
attacked as unrea&s;onable, ab&s;urd, unworthy of
God, hurtful to men; or to expo&s;e any error or
vice which has been recommended under the oppo|&s;ite
<PB N="240" REF="247">
views; only the&s;e latter have things for their
objects, not, like the former, per&s;ons. 3. De|mon&s;trative,
which relate to &s;omething pre&s;ent,
and are employed either in prai&s;e or blame. They
were employed in panegyrics on the excellence of
per&s;ons, characters, conduct, laws, forms of
government, or whatever could admit of an enco|mium;
and likewi&s;e, in invectives again&s;t per&s;ons
or things of an oppo&s;ite nature. Of this kind
were all their funeral orations on eminent per&s;ons,
orations in meetings for the choice of fit per&s;ons
for offices, or for continuing or repealing laws.
To this cla&s;s may be reduced &s;ermons on the
excellence of any great character recorded in
&s;cripture, on the excellence of Chri&s;tianity, or
of any particular doctrine or virtue, or on the
deformity of vice. As the be&s;t rules for eloquence
are to be found in the writings of the ancient
rhetoricians, and as they apply their rules particu|larly
to orations, according to this divi&s;ion of
them, it may be u&s;eful for you to con&s;ider, how
far, and in what re&s;pects, &s;ermons are analogous to
the&s;e &s;pecies of orations; for, &s;o far as they are,
all the rules of the ancients regarding each kind,
will be applicable for your direction in the compo|&s;ition
of &s;ermons. But this divi&s;ion is plainly
adapted to the &s;everal ends of &s;peaking and &s;orts of
di&s;cour&s;es, for which the con&s;titutions of Greece
and Rome gave opportunity; it gives not the mo&s;t
natural view of the variety of pulpit di&s;cour&s;es,
though it may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure accommodated
<PB N="241" REF="248">
to this; and therefore we &s;hall arrange them under
a different divi&s;ion;</P>
<P>As eloquence, con&s;idered in its large&s;t extent, is
the art of &s;peaking &s;o as to attain the end which
a man pur&s;ues; &s;o from the variety of the ends
which may be attained by &s;peaking, the mo&s;t
natural divi&s;ion of eloquence may be deduced.
Now a man can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed to aim at any
end, but one or other of the&s;e; to in&s;truct, to
convince, to plea&s;e, to move, or to per&s;uade; A
man who aims at in&s;tructing or at convincing,
addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, though in different ways, to the
under&s;tanding; he who aims at plea&s;ing, addre&s;&s;es
him&s;elf to the imagination; he who wants to
move, to the pa&s;&s;ions; and he who wants to per|&s;uade,
to the will. All the&s;e ends are allowed in
&s;ome &s;ort of compo&s;ition or another; and from
that end, the rules of that compo&s;ition, which are
no more than the proper means of promoting its
main de&s;ign, flow as from their &s;ource. But, from
the nature of Preaching, all the&s;e ends are &s;carcely
allowable in it. Some of them can never be in it
pur&s;ued for their own &s;akes, or ultimately, though
they may be u&s;ed as means to &s;omething farther;
and therefore will not come in, in determining the
kinds of pulpit di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>To plea&s;e, is an end which can &s;carcely ever be
ultimate to a preacher. A poet may be allowed to
re&s;t in plea&s;ing his readers, by pre&s;enting to their
<PB N="242" REF="249">
imaginations all that is &s;ublime and beautiful, by the
novelty of his thoughts, and the harmony of his
numbers. This is indeed the &s;ole end of pure
poetry or de&s;cription, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from other
kinds of compo&s;ition; and it aims at nothing but
in &s;ub&s;ervience to this end. If it convey ju&s;t and
&s;triking &s;entiments, if it move the pa&s;&s;ions, and
agitate the &s;oul with various emotions, it is only
as a mean to prevent di&s;gu&s;t, and to heighten the
delight. But it is only a &s;mall part even of poetry,
that re&s;ts wholly &s;atisfied with giving plea&s;ure. The
epic, the tragic, and all the greater kinds of
poetry, aim at &s;omething beyond it, and aim at
giving plea&s;ure only as &s;ubordinate to in&s;tructing,
moving, or per&s;uading. And if poets them&s;elves
generally aim at a farther end than plea&s;ure or
amu&s;ement, much more ought an orator con&s;tantly
to look beyond it: or, if it were allowable for the
orator at the bar or in the &s;enate &s;ometimes to aim
only at plea&s;ing, at exciting the admiration of
men, at &s;etting off his own ingenuity and parts,
and rai&s;ing his reputation; yet even on that &s;uppo|&s;ition
it could not be allowable in the preacher.
His function is &s;o important, the character he
&s;u&s;tains is &s;o grave and &s;acred, the &s;ubjects of
which he treats are &s;o momentous, that it is inex|cu&s;eable
to &s;pend any part of the time which men
allow for their being in&s;tructed in religion, and
excited to the duties of it, in merely amu&s;ing
them with ingenious thoughts and gaudy figures.
If a preacher only dazzle his hearers with the
<PB N="243" REF="250">
brightne&s;s of his &s;entiments, the vivacity of his
turns, or the beauty and propriety of his language,
he is a mere declaimer. A preacher ought never
to be actuated by a fond de&s;ire to plea&s;e, in any of
his performances. All true eloquence is fit to
plea&s;e; but plea&s;ing is not its true or ultimate end.
It may however be allowed, that there is one way
in which the chri&s;tian orator may properly enough
aim at plea&s;ing; he may endeavour to rai&s;e admi|ration
of a virtuous character or action. Admira|tion
is one &s;pecies of plea&s;ure; it is not, properly
&s;peaking, a pa&s;&s;ion, but a &s;entiment belonging to
the imagination; and the rai&s;ing of admiration is
the only way in which a preacher can be allowed,
profe&s;&s;edly and mainly, to addre&s;s the imagination
of his hearers.</P>
<P>It is very &s;eldom too, that moving can be the
ultimate end of a pulpit di&s;cour&s;e. It is indeed
often nece&s;&s;ary to move the pa&s;&s;ions in Preaching,
but not merely for the &s;ake of moving them. The
pa&s;&s;ions are the great &s;prings of action: in order to
per&s;uade men to any cour&s;e, it is always nece&s;&s;ary
that the pa&s;&s;ions be moved, engaged, and directed
to their proper objects; but they may &s;ometimes
be moved, without tending in any degree to per|&s;ua&s;ion;
and when this is the ca&s;e, to move them
is not properly Preaching. There is but one ca&s;e
in which a &s;ermon can properly re&s;t in this; when
it is de&s;igned to excite certain affections, which are
to be immediately exerted in the performance of
<PB N="244" REF="251">
&s;ome religious duty. When a &s;ermon is intended
to be a preparation for the right performance of that
religious duty, it may be allowable to point the
whole of it at rai&s;ing, to a great degree of fervour,
the devout affections &s;uitable to that duty. Of this
kind is what is called an Action &s;ermon. But
even in this ca&s;e, as the devout affections which
&s;hould be rai&s;ed tend directly to practice; as the
rai&s;ing them to a con&s;iderable height tends to
render them habitually prevalent; and as the reli|gious
duty in which they are exerted is a noble in|&s;trument
of virtuous practice, and directly &s;ub&s;er|vient
to it; the di&s;cour&s;e may be con&s;idered as not
wholly re&s;ting in moving the pa&s;&s;ions, but tends in
&s;ome mea&s;ure to per&s;ua&s;ion, and therefore may be
included in that cla&s;s, of which this is the main
and ultimate end. Thus, in dividing pulpit
di&s;cour&s;es, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to make a di&s;tinct
branch of tho&s;e which aim at moving the
pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the&s;e principles, we may divide all pulpit
di&s;cour&s;es into four kinds: 1. Such as aim at
in&s;truction or explication. 2. Such as aim at
convincing men of truth. 3. Such as aim at
rai&s;ing admiration of a virtuous character or
action. 4. Such as aim at per&s;uading men to
goodne&s;s.</P>

<PB N="245" REF="252">
<HEAD>ART. I. Of In&s;tructive or Explicatory Di&s;cour&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ort of pulpit di&s;cour&s;es are in&s;tructive
or explicatory di&s;cour&s;es. They are addre&s;&s;ed to
the under&s;tanding, to our powers of perception or
apprehen&s;ion. Their de&s;ign is &s;imply to make the
hearers comprehend or know the nature and ex|tent
of the &s;ubject. They may be reduced to dif|ferent
kinds, according to the different &s;ubjects
which it properly belongs to a preacher to explain.
The&s;e &s;ubjects are three: 1. A pa&s;&s;age of &s;crip|ture.
2. A doctrine or duty of religion. 3. A
character.</P>
<P>1. As the Chri&s;tian religion is contained in the
&s;criptures, and as it is proper that every Chri&s;tian
&s;hould be able to read the &s;criptures with under|&s;tanding,
the explication of a particular pa&s;&s;age
of &s;cripture is often a fit &s;ubject of a di&s;cour&s;e from
the pulpit. This kind of di&s;cour&s;e is already
marked out by the name of a Lecture, though we
mu&s;t extend this name a little beyond ordinary
u&s;e, in order to take in all the di&s;cour&s;es that pro|perly
belong to this head. It is commonly rec|koned
a di&s;cour&s;e on a large pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture;
for the mo&s;t part, it &s;hould be &s;o; but the extent
of the pa&s;&s;age is not e&s;&s;ential to the idea of a lec|ture.
A lecture is any di&s;cour&s;e de&s;igned to ex|plain
the import of a particular pa&s;&s;age of &s;crip|ture,
Now, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture are diffi|cult;
<PB N="246" REF="253">
others are ea&s;y and practical. Hence will
ari&s;e two kinds of lectures, which we may call,
for di&s;tinction, critical, and practical.</P>
<P>The main de&s;ign of a critical lecture is to give a
di&s;tinct view of the meaning of a pa&s;&s;age of &s;crip|ture.
In order to explain it, it is fir&s;t of all ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
to find out the general de&s;ign and &s;cope
of the pa&s;&s;age; for a clear view of this will throw
great light upon all the parts; and by exhibiting
a di&s;tinct comprehen&s;ion of this to the audience,
they will be enabled to enter into all the particular
illu&s;trations, and to perceive their whole force.
If, for example, a P&s;alm be the &s;ubject of lec|ture;
when we can find out the author of it, the
occa&s;ion on which he compo&s;ed it, his &s;ituation
when he compo&s;ed it, what he had in view by it;
this will of it&s;elf often illu&s;trate many of the ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
&s;how the propriety of the &s;entiments,
give them a peculiar force and beauty, and render
the whole a lively picture of the author's &s;oul, of
the different emotions to which he was &s;ubject, of
their conflicts with each other, and of the &s;enti|ments
and affections which prevailed and chiefly
influenced him. Whatever place of &s;cripture be
pitched on, there is the &s;ame need for con&s;idering
the &s;cope and occa&s;ion. It were ea&s;y to point out
many pa&s;&s;ages in the Go&s;pels, where a different
view of the general de&s;ign will lead to very different
explications of the particulars; and where, with|out
fixing on the de&s;ign, it is impo&s;&s;ible to give
<PB N="247" REF="254">
any tolerable, or con&s;i&s;tent explication of them at
all. In the Epi&s;tles, it is &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary; for
&s;ometimes a whole Epi&s;tle, and always a large
portion of an Epi&s;tle, is a chain of rea&s;oning all
tending to one point, either confirming or illu&s;|trating
it; and not to con&s;ider it in this light, is
to mi&s;s the whole meaning of the writer. You
need only look into any good commentator on any
paragraph of an Epi&s;tle, to be convinced how much
the under&s;tanding, and, by con&s;equence, the ex|plaining
of it depends on perceiving the general
&s;cope. There are indeed &s;ome parts of &s;cripture
in which no connection is pre&s;erved, but almo&s;t
all the &s;entences are unconnected, as particularly
the book of Proverbs; and there it is &s;ufficient to
attend to the &s;cope of each di&s;tinct aphori&s;m.</P>
<P>It will follow from the ob&s;ervation that has been
already made, that it is proper to lecture on the
&s;criptures in the order in which they lie, or on a
book regularly from beginning to end; except the
P&s;alms, which being &s;eparate pieces, and not ranged
in the order in which they were written, may be
explained with equal propriety in almo&s;t any order;
for each may be con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct book. But
in other parts of &s;cripture, it is by thus going re|gularly
through a whole book that we can follow
the &s;cope of the author, and unfold it gradually to
the hearers, with all that is &s;aid in order to pro|mote
it. In going through any book of &s;cripture,
one will &s;ometimes come to ver&s;es which are plain
<PB N="248" REF="255">
enough to be under&s;tood by all. It is enough to
read the&s;e, without attempting any explication of
them; for this would both wa&s;te time needle&s;sly,
and make the people imagine, either that they were
ob&s;cure, or that the preacher trifled. If a ver&s;e
contain any expre&s;&s;ions that are ob&s;cure, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
in explaining it, to a&s;certain the meaning
of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, either from other places of
&s;cripture where they are u&s;ed, or by other ea&s;y and
convincing means. If any of the expre&s;&s;ions be
metaphorical, it is proper to point out from what
the metaphor is taken, what is the force of it, and
how it is applied to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. The
meaning of every difficult expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be re|pre&s;ented
in as plain terms as po&s;&s;ible. This is
often the fir&s;t &s;tep towards an explication of a
ver&s;e. But a preacher mu&s;t not re&s;t here; for it
is not enough to find out the meaning of a &s;ingle
expre&s;&s;ion; it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;how the force which
it has in that particular place, and how, in con|junction
with the other expre&s;&s;ions, it tends to
make up the meaning of the whole. It is a great
fault in lecturing, to enlarge on every &s;ingle ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
as if it were a complete &s;en&s;e, and to
rai&s;e doctrines and ob&s;ervations from it in this way.
This is not to analize the &s;cripture, but to mangle
it; it is not to explain it, but to play with it, to
&s;peak about it and about it, to wre&s;t and di&s;tort it.
When any ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ions which occur in a
ver&s;e are explained, it is next proper, putting the
explication of them, or plainer words in the place
<PB N="249" REF="256">
of them, to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of the whole ver&s;e or
whole clau&s;e, as clearly, as &s;hortly, and as &s;trik|ingly
as po&s;&s;ible. If the ver&s;e be a &s;imple, com|plete,
and unconnected &s;en&s;e, no more is nece&s;&s;ary
for the explication of it. If it be a propo&s;ition
laid down to be proved or illu&s;trated, this mu&s;t be
expre&s;sly taken notice of, that it may be kept in
view, and that the view of it may throw light on
all the arguments or illu&s;trations produced in &s;up|port
of it. If it be a part of a chain of rea&s;oning,
or an argument or illu&s;tration of any particular
point, then, after the general &s;en&s;e of it is un|folded,
its force for proving the point in hand, or
its influence in illu&s;trating it, mu&s;t be &s;hown; for
this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for explaining it as it
there &s;tands. It often happens in &s;cripture, that a
particular pa&s;&s;age expre&s;&s;es &s;ome affection or tem|per
of the per&s;on who writes it. In this ca&s;e, it
cannot be truly explained by unfolding, in the
cleare&s;t manner, the import of every expre&s;&s;ion.
This would be only to repre&s;ent the dead carca&s;e
of the &s;entiment, but to mi&s;s the &s;oul or &s;pirit of
it. A preacher &s;hould endeavour to paint the
affection expre&s;&s;ed, to the life, and to transfu&s;e it
into his hearers. This is the ca&s;e particularly
in the P&s;alms, and in all the places of &s;cripture
which are devotional, This is no more than en|tering
into the &s;pirit of the author, which is con|fe&s;&s;edly,
in every ca&s;e, nece&s;&s;ary for explaining
him. In lectures to a congregation, a di&s;play of
<PB N="250" REF="257">
critical knowlege is always improper; it is enough
that the preacher proceed upon the principles of
genuine critici&s;m; he &s;hould &s;eldom lay open the&s;e
principles to the congregation, for they cannot
enter into them, and will rather be perplexed by
them. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it is improper to
mention a number of different explications of a
pa&s;&s;age. It is generally be&s;t to give them the ex|plication
that appears to be mo&s;t probable, without
troubling them with any other, which would both
confound them, and perhaps lead them to think
the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture uncertain. In lecturing,
every thing &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed as &s;hortly as po&s;&s;i|ble,
for thus it will be be&s;t remembered; and as
clearly as po&s;&s;ible, for this is nece&s;&s;ary to explica|tion,
the chief means of promoting which is per|&s;picuity.</P>
<P>A lecture is a di&s;cour&s;e which admits very little
ornament, very little of addre&s;s either to the ima|gination
or the pa&s;&s;ions. But it &s;ometimes even
requires a little of both. As much as is nece&s;&s;ary
to pre&s;erve attention is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, and at|tention
can &s;carcely be pre&s;erved, where neither
the imagination is in any degree gratified, nor the
pa&s;&s;ions rou&s;ed. But &s;ometimes the nature of the
pa&s;&s;age to be explained, demands more. When
it abounds with images, for in&s;tance, it is be&s;t ex|plained
by unfolding them, and making them
more &s;triking to the fancy, When it expre&s;&s;es
<PB N="251" REF="258">
any pa&s;&s;ion or temper, it is be&s;t explained by di&s;|playing
that, and infu&s;ing it by &s;ympathy into the
hearers.</P>
<P>The lectures which we have termed critical,
may be &s;ubdivided into two &s;orts; 1. Such as are
explications of a large portion of &s;cripture. The&s;e
are now commonly called lectures. They are the
more nece&s;&s;ary in our church, becau&s;e they are
now the only thing we have in place of public
reading of the &s;criptures, which, in oppo&s;ition to
our own directory, they have unhappily ju&s;tled
out. In di&s;cour&s;es of this &s;ort, it was formerly
remarked to be proper, to explain a book regu|larly
throughout. For every di&s;tinct lecture, a
di&s;tinct and complete paragraph or &s;en&s;e &s;hould be
cho&s;en. It is always proper to add to the expli|cation
of the ver&s;es, &s;uch practical reflections and
exhortations as naturally ari&s;e from them. The&s;e
ought not, in general, to be mixed with the ex|plication,
becau&s;e it would break the connection,
and keep the force of the whole from being per|ceived.
It is better to &s;ubjoin them to the expli|cation;
for thus it will be&s;t appear that they are
founded in the pa&s;&s;age, and they can be pro&s;ecuted
together, and without interruption. It &s;ometimes
happens, that one paragraph is too &s;hort for a
lecture, and that two or three can be compre|hended
in it. Then, the reflections ari&s;ing from
one of the paragraphs may be &s;ubjoined imme|diately
to the explication of that paragraph, before
<PB N="252" REF="259">
proceeding to the explication of another. For,
&s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e is, in reality, two or more di&s;tinct
lectures put together. 2. Such as are explications
of one ver&s;e or two, which contain &s;ome con&s;ider|able
difficulties. The&s;e are lectures, according to
the definition we have given; for their de&s;ign is
the explication of a part of &s;cripture; and all the
rules which we have laid down, are as applicable
to them as to the former &s;ort. An Exerci&s;e and
addition is a di&s;cour&s;e of this &s;ort, when it is pro|perly
pur&s;ued; not &s;pent in an u&s;ele&s;s grammatical
analy&s;is of the words, but employed in a true cri|tical
explication of them. Only it is plain, that
when &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e is brought to the pulpit, it
mu&s;t not be filled with the words of the original
language. Making allowance for this circum&s;tance,
many of Clarke's di&s;cour&s;es are of this &s;ort, and
very proper models for them. In a di&s;cour&s;e of
this kind, the meaning of the words &s;hould be
fir&s;t cleared up; then, the doctrine which they
truly contain, &s;hould be propo&s;ed and briefly il|lu&s;trated;
and then, the u&s;e and improvement of
that doctrine &s;hould be &s;hortly pointed out. The
proper &s;ubject for &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e is a text, which
at once is difficult, and contains &s;ome important
and u&s;eful doctrine. Di&s;cour&s;es of this &s;ort will
naturally be inter&s;per&s;ed with tho&s;e of the former
kind; for in every book, one will now and then
meet with a difficult ver&s;e, which requires a parti|cular
explication. And as, on the one hand, it is
contrary to the de&s;ign of lecturing to &s;pend more
<PB N="253" REF="260">
time than is nece&s;&s;ary in explaining a clear pa&s;&s;age;
&s;o, on the other hand, it would be wrong, when
a difficult pa&s;&s;age occurs, not to allow it the time
that is really nece&s;&s;ary for explaining it.</P>
<P>Every part of &s;cripture is intended either to
illu&s;trate and enforce our duty, or to explain and
confirm &s;ome doctrine of religion; and as all the
doctrines of religion are &s;ub&s;ervient to practice,
and are propo&s;ed as motives to our duty, we may
ju&s;tly &s;ay that every part of &s;cripture is &s;it to in|fluence
our practice. On this account practical
reflections are, as we have ob&s;erved, an e&s;&s;ential
part even of a critical lecture. But there are many
pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which are extremely plain in
them&s;elves, and need very little explication: the&s;e
are the proper &s;ubjects for that &s;pecies of lecturing
which we have termed practical. Some of the
rules of critical lectures, already laid down, are
likewi&s;e applicable to the&s;e: for in&s;tance, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the general de&s;ign and &s;cope
of the pa&s;&s;age. Even in a plain pa&s;&s;age, there are
generally &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions that need to be ex|plained.
The&s;e &s;hould be fir&s;t of all explained,
according to the rules already mentioned. After
this, the practical ob&s;ervations which ari&s;e from
the pa&s;&s;age, &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted. In pro&s;ecuting
them, two things are nece&s;&s;ary; fir&s;t, to &s;how that
each ob&s;ervation is founded on the pa&s;&s;age; and
next, to illu&s;trate the ob&s;ervation it&s;elf, and apply
it to practice. There are many parts of &s;cripture
<PB N="254" REF="261">
fit for &s;uch lectures. Thus many hi&s;torical pa&s;&s;ages
are &s;o ea&s;y, that very little is nece&s;&s;ary for clearing
up the narration; and that little may often be be&s;t
done by giving the &s;ub&s;tance of the hi&s;tory in
modern language, and even with greater brevity
than it lies in the pa&s;&s;age. After that is done, a
preacher &s;hould point out, with what view &s;uch a
pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;tory is recorded, to what end we may
apply it, what le&s;&s;ons we may learn from it; and
in pointing out this, may very properly &s;pend the
greate&s;t part of the di&s;cour&s;e. The parables of our
Saviour al&s;o are extremely proper &s;ubjects of prac|tical
lectures. It is at lea&s;t, in general, proper fir&s;t
to explain the whole &s;tory or &s;imilitude in its literal
&s;en&s;e, &s;o far as it needs to be explained, that thus
the whole import of it may be &s;een at once. This
literal explication of the ver&s;es will generally be
extremely &s;hort. But it is be&s;t to give it altogether;
it will afford an opportunity of &s;howing the pro|priety,
the beauty, and the real occa&s;ion of many
of the circum&s;tances which are &s;uppo&s;ed or re|lated;
it will likewi&s;e tend to prevent a fault which
is very common in explaining parables, but a fault
which ought to be carefully avoided; I mean, the
drawing a moral from every circum&s;tance or inci|dent
of the parable. This fault has in a great mea|&s;ure
ari&s;en from giving the meaning and intention
of the parable as one proceeded, ver&s;e by ver&s;e,
which obliged him to contrive &s;omething de&s;igned
by every circum&s;tance; though it is plain that
many circum&s;tances are added, merely to render
<PB N="255" REF="262">
the literal &s;tory probable, or for ornament, but
have nothing an&s;wering to them in the moral.
And it were ea&s;y to give many in&s;tances of &s;trange
my&s;tical explications which have been devi&s;ed from
&s;ome circum&s;tances of our Saviour's parables. In
general, it is proper fir&s;t of all to explain the
parable it&s;elf, as if it were a literal &s;tory, and had
no farther meaning, &s;o far as it needs explication
in this way; and it is proper that this be a con|tinued
explication, not interrupted by pointing out
the meaning of any part of it, at lea&s;t in mo&s;t
ca&s;es. After this is done, we mu&s;t next explain
the real de&s;ign and intention of the &s;imilitude, and
propo&s;e the in&s;tructions which it was de&s;igned to
convey. When the&s;e are propo&s;ed after the whole
explication, the &s;ame fault mu&s;t be avoided which
we have already taken notice of. We are often,
e&s;pecially young men, apt to be greatly plea&s;ed
with finding &s;ome my&s;tical &s;en&s;e in every circum|&s;tance.
To allegori&s;e them all has an appearance
of ingenuity, and therefore gratifies; but it is
always merely fanciful and uncertain, and there|fore
&s;hould be avoided. It is always faulty to
refine in this manner, to found doctrines or to
&s;queeze maxims from every incident in a figurative
di&s;cour&s;e. It is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h the cir|cum&s;tances
which are brought in merely to fill up
or adorn the narration, from tho&s;e which are e&s;&s;en|tial
to the parable. Attention to the occa&s;ion of
the parable, or to the run of the incidents, or to
the reflections made on it, will enable us to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
<PB N="256" REF="263">
between the&s;e. We mu&s;t draw the moral
only from the latter, and inculcate the in&s;truction
which the parable was plainly de&s;igned to convey.
As all our Saviour's parables were originally
addre&s;&s;ed to the Jews, mo&s;t of them were de&s;igned
to convey &s;ome in&s;truction, which their particular
circum&s;tances rendered nece&s;&s;ary. It is proper
always to take notice what this in&s;truction was,
becau&s;e the view of it adds greatly to the force
and beauty of the parable. Sometimes it will be
be&s;t to exhibit the whole import of the parable with
re&s;pect to the Jews together, and afterwards to
&s;how what in&s;truction it conveys to all Chri&s;tians.
Sometimes again, when the in&s;tructions conveyed
by a parable are pretty much di&s;tinct, it will be
better to con&s;ider each in&s;truction &s;eparately, as
directed fir&s;t to the Jews, and then as applicable
to Chri&s;tians. But &s;till, whichever of the&s;e ways
be cho&s;en, the principal part of a lecture on a
parable &s;hould be inculcating on the auditory the
in&s;tructions which it conveys. In pro&s;ecuting the
in&s;tructions that ari&s;e from a parable, it has always
a peculiar beauty, to introduce only &s;uch allu&s;ions,
&s;imilitudes, and illu&s;trations, as have an analogy to
the circum&s;tances of the parable. This prevents a
confu&s;ion of metaphors and figures: it makes the
whole appear to ri&s;e naturally from the parable:
it &s;erves to inculcate the whole with the greater
force. You will find models of the manner of
explaining parables which we have recommended,
in Tillot&s;on's di&s;cour&s;es on the parable of the ten
<PB N="257" REF="264">
virgins, and the parable of the rich man and
Lazarus. I &s;hall mention only one other &s;ubject
proper for this &s;ort of lecture, which we have
termed practical, the book of Proverbs. Some of
the apothegms there need a critical explication; but
in explaining all of them, the principal thing to be
done is to repre&s;ent the &s;entiment or maxim which
each contains, in a &s;trong and &s;triking light, &s;o
that it may affect and touch the hearers. And as
they are all &s;eparate practical &s;ayings, there is &s;carcely
any need of general reflections at the end of a
lecture on &s;everal of them.</P>
<P>A practical, as well as a critical lecture, may be
&s;ometimes made on a &s;ingle ver&s;e, or a &s;mall por|tion
of &s;cripture. A di&s;cour&s;e on a &s;ingle ver&s;e is
always properly a practical lecture, when it is not
a pro&s;ecution of &s;ome one &s;ubject, but is intended
to explain or enforce all the in&s;tructions which are
implied in the &s;everal members of the ver&s;e. Thus
every di&s;cour&s;e, pro&s;ecuted in what is called the
textual method, is properly a lecture, either of the
critical or the practical fort, or often a mixture of
both. A &s;ermon, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the&s;e,
is the pro&s;ecution of &s;ome one &s;ubject, in &s;ome
or other of the ways that will be afterwards
explained.</P>
<P>2. Lectures are confined to an explication of
the &s;criptures; but there are other &s;ubjects which
it is nece&s;&s;ary to explain. A &s;econd kind of expli|catory
<PB N="258" REF="265">
di&s;cour&s;es is &s;uch as are intended to open up
or illu&s;trate a particular doctrine or duty of reli|gion.
It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a doctrine be
under&s;tood, before it can be believed. It is ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary that a duty be under&s;tood, before
it can be practi&s;ed. It is therefore proper that
di&s;cour&s;es be often employed in explaining both.
A &s;ubject of this kind is either &s;imple or complex;
a regard mu&s;t be had to this di&s;tinction in explain|ing
it.</P>
<P>Some &s;imple &s;ubjects are at the &s;ame time &s;o
ea&s;y and well known, that any explication of them
is unnece&s;&s;ary; it cannot make them plainer; and
in that ca&s;e, it would be mere trifling. All our
natural pa&s;&s;ions, as joy, grief, love, hatred, are
known to every one by immediate feeling, and
cannot be made clearer by any verbal explication;
all that can be done is to refer the hearers to what
they feel. In di&s;cour&s;ing on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, it may
indeed be nece&s;&s;ary and proper to point out the
&s;everal views which the &s;cripture gives of them,
the objects which it pre&s;ents to them, the good
purpo&s;es which they an&s;wer, or the abu&s;es to
which they are liable; but all this is different from
explaining the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf. When a &s;imple &s;ubject
needs explication, or can be made clearer by it,
the explication may be performed by a definition
marking preci&s;ely what it is. The rules of defi|nition
are given in logic, and have their foundation
in nature. 1. It &s;hould be &s;hort. 2. It &s;hould
<PB N="259" REF="266">
be per&s;picuous; and therefore both ob&s;cure and
metaphorical terms &s;hould be avoided in it. 3. It
&s;hould be exact, &s;o that the definition may be &s;ub|&s;tituted
for the name of the thing defined; it mu&s;t
on the one hand exhau&s;t the &s;ubject, and, on the
other hand, include nothing but what belongs to
it. A &s;imple &s;ubject may be farther explained,
by di&s;tingui&s;hing it from &s;ome other with which it
is naturally connected or nearly allied, and with
which it may therefore readily be confounded.
Thus kindne&s;s, meekne&s;s, and placability, are
virtues near a-kin, and yet really di&s;tinct. A per|&s;on
may have a very warm and affectionate di&s;po|&s;ition,
and yet not po&s;&s;e&s;s meekne&s;s, which is a
calmne&s;s in oppo&s;tion to anger, and not ea&s;ily
ruffled even by great provocations; and a man
may po&s;&s;e&s;s this temper, and yet not be placable,
but unrelenting, when once provoked. Things
which have no natural connection often acquire an
artificial connection, or become &s;o related in the
opinions of men, that they are as readily con|founded
as if they had been naturally connected;
and con&s;equently it is as nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h
them. The power of education, cu&s;tom, example,
the ignorance, the weakne&s;s, and the pa&s;&s;ions of
men, lead them to form many unju&s;t a&s;&s;ociations;
and on no &s;ubject more frequently than on religion
and morality, where it is al&s;o mo&s;t dangerous.
To break the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, to &s;eparate things
which are totally di&s;tinct and yet often confounded,
is a point of great importance in di&s;cour&s;es calcu|lated
<PB N="260" REF="267">
for the religious improvement of mankind.
Thus religion is often confounded with &s;uper|&s;tition;
yet they are very different. Super&s;tition
repre&s;ents God as a capricious being, plea&s;ed with
in&s;ignificant ceremonies and ab&s;tinence from indif|ferent
things, and &s;evere on the neglect of them.
True religion mu&s;t be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from
this; it is the very rever&s;e; it con&s;i&s;ts in having
ju&s;t conceptions of the divine nature and per|fections,
in exerci&s;ing &s;uch devout affections as
corre&s;pond to the&s;e, and in exerting them both in
external devotion and obedience to his will. Thus
zeal for truth and goodne&s;s, and virtuous indig|nation
again&s;t vice, are often confounded with,
and therefore mu&s;t be explained as perfectly di&s;tinct
from, a &s;ettled &s;ourne&s;s or violence of temper, and
hatred of men's per&s;ons for difference in opinions
or ceremonies. In the imaginations of &s;ome,
pride, which con&s;i&s;ts in a high opinion of one's
own talents and endowments, and leads to re&s;ent
the &s;entiments of others concerning him, when
they fall below this &s;tandard, is connected and
confounded with greatne&s;s of mind, which is
totally different, which con&s;i&s;ts in a freedom from
all mean pa&s;&s;ions, little de&s;igns, and intere&s;ted
views. On the other hand, humility is by &s;ome
confounded with littlene&s;s of &s;oul and meanne&s;s of
&s;pirit; but no two things are more different. Hu|mility
ari&s;es from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our own imperfec|tion,
of the narrowne&s;s of our under&s;tanding, of
the defects of our knowlege, of the weakne&s;s of
<PB N="261" REF="268">
our virtues; and it is never found except in tho&s;e
who have conceived a high &s;tandard of perfection
and virtue, and who, from frequent &s;elf-reflection,
are con&s;cious that they fall below it. But the
forming of &s;uch a high &s;tandard is &s;o far from
having any tendency to produce meanne&s;s or little|ne&s;s
of mind, that on the contrary, it has the
&s;tronge&s;t tendency to wear it off, to exalt our
aims, to cheri&s;h whatever is great or worthy, and
to rai&s;e us gradually nearer to the &s;tandard which
we have conceived. Thus again, envy and emu|lation
are often confounded, and mu&s;t be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed;
the former is an unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;upe|riority
of others, producing a de&s;ire that they may
be brought down to our level, or below it; the
latter is a noble ardour for attaining excellence,
leading us only to improve our&s;elves. A &s;imple
&s;ubject may be explained, not only by a definition,
and by di&s;tingui&s;hing it from others with which it
is apt to be confounded, but al&s;o by de&s;cription.
A thing that cannot be defined, may notwith&s;tand|ing
be de&s;cribed; and after a &s;ubject has been de|fined,
it may be illu&s;trated. A &s;ubject may be
de&s;cribed or illu&s;trated in many different ways.
Many things are very properly de&s;cribed by their
effects. The divine perfections cannot be con|ceived
by us ab&s;tractly, as they exi&s;t in God; they
are conceived only by means of their effects, and
as &s;howing them&s;elves in the&s;e; and it is by pro|perly
pointing out their effects in the works and
ways of God, that they can be explained. In ex|plaining
<PB N="262" REF="269">
a thing by its effects, the mo&s;t &s;triking
and intere&s;ting of them &s;hould be &s;elected; this
will render the explication animated and &s;pirited.
Such principal and leading effects likewi&s;e &s;hould
be cho&s;en, as include or &s;ugge&s;t many particulars;
this will prevent tediou&s;ne&s;s of illu&s;tration, and
render it full in a con&s;i&s;tence with brevity. In
particular, any virtue or vice cannot be more pro|perly
explained, than by pointing out how it &s;hows
it&s;elf in human life. This may be done by exam|ples
taken from hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially from the &s;acred
hi&s;tory; or it may be done by pointing out how it
&s;hows it&s;elf in the different &s;ituations of life; for
in&s;tance, humility may be explained, by pointing
out how it will lead us to behave to tho&s;e who are
our inferiors, our equals, or our &s;uperiors, in
knowlege, in religious improvement, in rank, in
age, or in character; this will give a full and the
mo&s;t practical view of the &s;ubject. A &s;imple &s;ub|ject
may be farther explained by compari&s;on with
others nearly related to it, or in any re&s;pect analo|gous
to it, but better known, or better defined.
A &s;ubject may likewi&s;e be illu&s;trated by contra&s;ting
it with its oppo&s;ite; for oppo&s;ites &s;et by one an|other,
mutually illu&s;trate and throw light on each
other. Humility and pride, temperance and in|temperance,
piety and impiety, when oppo&s;ed in
their natures and their effects, on the per&s;ons
them&s;elves or on others, will by this means be
better under&s;tood. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that all
the&s;e methods of explication are not nece&s;&s;arily to
<PB N="263" REF="270">
be united on every &s;ubject; but a per&s;on's own
judgement mu&s;t direct him, which of them is pro|per
on each particular &s;ubject, as he has occa&s;ion
to treat it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind of &s;ubjects for explication is
complex, or &s;uch a &s;ubject as is made up of dif|ferent
parts into which it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed.
In this ca&s;e, whether a doctrine or a duty be the
&s;ubject to be explained, it is fir&s;t of all nece&s;&s;ary
for the explication, that the &s;everal parts or
branches of it be pointed out di&s;tinctly, and in a
natural order. Di&s;tinctne&s;s and order are nece&s;&s;ary
in every kind of di&s;cour&s;e; but they are above all
nece&s;&s;ary here, where information is the ultimate
end. If the parts be confu&s;edly jumbled together,
or if the &s;ubject be not di&s;tributed into its natural
and complete members, or if the &s;everal members
be not exhibited in their natural order and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
the di&s;cour&s;e can convey only an imper|fect,
or a confu&s;ed idea of the doctrine or the duty.
The principal rules of a ju&s;t divi&s;ion are three.
1. It &s;hould be complete; the &s;everal parts taken
together &s;hould exhau&s;t the &s;ubject. For example,
if we &s;hould divide all practical religion into the
duties which we owe to God, and tho&s;e which we
owe to our neighbour, the divi&s;ion would be faulty;
for there is a third cla&s;s di&s;tinct from both the&s;e,
the duties which we owe to our&s;elves. 2. In a ju&s;t
divi&s;ion, all the parts &s;hould be di&s;tinct and &s;epa|rate,
&s;o that no one of them be included in an|other.
<PB N="264" REF="271">
3. The parts &s;hould &s;ucceed each other in
a natural order; the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t fundamental
going before the others, and ri&s;ing &s;tep by &s;tep
through the&s;e others. For example, in explaining
the love of God in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, to
find out the natural order of the parts, we may
reflect on what pa&s;&s;es in our minds towards a
per&s;on whom we e&s;teem and love, a per&s;on of high
abilities with whom we are connected by &s;ome
degree of dependence, and from who&s;e favour we
expect &s;ome advantages. To &s;uch an one we will
feel, 1. High e&s;teem of his talents and virtues;
2. A propen&s;ity to think often and to &s;peak ho|nourably
of them; 3. De&s;ire of his happine&s;s and
joy in it; 4. De&s;ire of his approbation and plea|&s;ure
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it; 5. Gratitude for his favours;
6. Confidence in him. This may be ea&s;ily tran&s;|ferred
to God. If the fir&s;t of the&s;e were placed
any where el&s;e, the divi&s;ion would be confu&s;ed;
for e&s;teem is the foundation of all the re&s;t. When
the &s;ubject is thus properly divided into its parts,
each part &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted according to the
rules already mentioned for the explication of a
&s;imple &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y to produce many examples both of
a proper and improper order in explaining doctrines
or duties. But you will ea&s;ily be convinced of the
nece&s;&s;ity of the former, and of the inconveniences
of the latter, without our &s;pending time in pro|ducing
examples. The be&s;t means of leading you
<PB N="265" REF="272">
into a proper order in compo&s;ing on any particular
&s;ubject, is a thorough under&s;tanding of that &s;ub|ject,
and of the dependence of its &s;everal parts.
This will enable you to throw them into that order,
in which they will reflect greate&s;t light on one an|other.
On &s;ome &s;ubjects, however, different or|ders
in arranging the parts may be equally natural,
and each may have &s;ome advantages. For ex|ample,
in explaining religion in general, as con|&s;i&s;ting
of three kinds of duties, we may begin with
the duties to our&s;elves, which are &s;imple and ea&s;ily
comprehended; as &s;elf-government, or a due com|mand
of our &s;en&s;ual appetites, &s;o that they may
not lead us into gratifications prejudicial to our
health, vigour, reputation, or fortune; and of
anger, re&s;entment, and other pa&s;&s;ions de&s;tructive
of the peace of our minds; attention to the im|provement
of our rational powers, and the pro&s;e|cution
of our mo&s;t important, our &s;piritual and
eternal intere&s;t. Next, the duties which ari&s;e from
our connection with other men, with individuals,
with a family, or with larger &s;ocieties. Next, the
duties incumbent on us as members of the media|torial
kingdom of Chri&s;t. And la&s;tly, tho&s;e which
belong to us as creatures, as &s;ubjects of God's ra|tional
kingdom. Or, we may ob&s;erve the con|trary
order, beginning with our duties to God,
and de&s;cending to the inferior duties. The former
gives the mo&s;t ea&s;y view of the &s;ubject, as the fir&s;t
&s;teps are &s;imple, and prepare the way for the com|prehen&s;ion
of the &s;ucceeding ones; the latter may
<PB N="266" REF="273">
give the complete&s;t view of each part, as founded
in the authority of God. The former would be
the proper order in in&s;tructing a per&s;on totally un|acquainted
with the &s;ubject; for it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
to give him an idea of love, reverence,
and gratitude to God, without having fir&s;t taught
him to ob&s;erve the motions of his heart towards
men; the latter will, perhaps, give the mo&s;t &s;olid
and comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;ubject, to one who
has already a general acquaintance with it.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of di&s;tributing the &s;ubject to be
explained, into its natural members, I do not
mean to recommend a multiplicity of dry divi&s;ions
and &s;ubdivi&s;ions. This cu&s;tom, unknown to the
ancient orators, and to all the Chri&s;tian preachers
of the fir&s;t ages, was introduced by the &s;chola&s;tics.
It often gives only a &s;eeming order to the di&s;cour&s;e,
but really mangles and breaks it; by following
it too much, a preacher does not, like a &s;kilful
anatomi&s;t, &s;eparate his di&s;cour&s;e into its proper
parts; but, like a butcher, cuts it out into a num|ber
of pieces. A divi&s;ion is more nece&s;&s;ary in an
explicatory &s;ermon, than in any other. But even
here, a &s;imple and natural divi&s;ion of the doctrine
or duty into its general parts is &s;ufficient; and &s;ub|divi&s;ions
generally break the &s;ubject and clog the
memory. It is much better that without them
every part be placed in its natural &s;ituation. Both
in dividing and in pro&s;ecuting the explication of a
&s;ubject, all &s;chola&s;tic terms and method &s;hould be
<PB N="267" REF="274">
avoided. A preacher &s;hould not explain a doc|trine
or duty, by the technical terms of metaphy|&s;icians,
but as much as po&s;&s;ible, in the language of
common &s;en&s;e, and in the words of &s;cripture. He
&s;hould not divide it in the forced method of the
logical topics, but in the natural way that will
convey &s;uch a conception of it, as may tend to in|fluence
practice.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of an explicatory di&s;cour&s;e being to
inform the under&s;tanding, there can be in it no
direct or profe&s;&s;ed proofs of the truth of the doc|trine,
or arguments for the duty, which is the
&s;ubject of it; the whole is de&s;igned for explication.
By con&s;idering, therefore, what is implied in ex|plication,
or what is nece&s;&s;ary for accompli&s;hing it,
we may perceive the nature of an explicatory di&s;|cour&s;e.
Now, it is plain that every particular in|cluded
in a doctrine or duty, mu&s;t be clearly ex|pre&s;&s;ed,
and &s;pread out as it were. It mu&s;t like|wi&s;e
be &s;hown, that every particular introduced,
is really included in that doctrine or duty; and
that it ari&s;es from the preceding and is &s;ub&s;ervient
to the &s;ucceeding parts of it; and thus, rea&s;oning
is introduced on the &s;everal particulars of a doc|trine
or duty, even in an explicatory di&s;cour&s;e,
though not on the truth of the general doctrine,
or obligation of the whole duty.</P>
<P>Explication, from its very nature, admits very
little of addre&s;s to the imagination or the pa&s;&s;ions.
<PB N="268" REF="275">
But it does not exclude it altogether. Even in ex|plaining
a doctrine, compari&s;ons, metaphors, and
all other figures which &s;erve for illu&s;tration, are
very naturally introduced. The explication of a
duty admits &s;omething more. It is the de&s;ign of
an explicatory &s;ermon, not &s;o much to give a dry
analy&s;is of a duty, which would enable a morali&s;t
to comprehend di&s;tinctly all that it includes, as to
give a &s;triking view of it in its whole extent, $it to
influence the practice. It is its de&s;ign, not &s;o
much to inform per&s;ons of what they did not
know before, as to give them a lively &s;en&s;e of the
nature of a duty generally under&s;tood. In order
to an&s;wer this end, every thing that is &s;aid mu&s;t
be addre&s;&s;ed, though not to the pa&s;&s;ions, yet to the
feelings of mankind. This is what is properly
termed, &s;entiment; a notion or opinion &s;et in &s;uch
a light as to touch the feelings, particularly any of
the internal or reflex &s;en&s;es of human nature.
Every thing that is &s;aid in explaining a duty &s;hould
be &s;et in &s;uch a light as to touch the con&s;ciences
of the hearers, with a &s;en&s;e of its beauty, pro|priety
or obligation. This can &s;carcely fail to hap|pen,
if the &s;entiments them&s;elves be ju&s;t and true,
and be expre&s;&s;ed by the preacher &s;o as to &s;how
that he feels them him&s;elf. For then the hearers
will, by &s;ympathy with him, conceive them
&s;trongly; and a &s;trong conception of any duty
will always produce a perception of its obligation
or propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276">
3. There is likewi&s;e a third &s;ort of explicatory
di&s;cour&s;es, in which the &s;ubject to be explained is
a particular character. The two former kinds are
very common; this kind is more rare, but may
be &s;ometimes u&s;ed with great advantage. Butler's
&s;ermon on the character of Balaam is an example
of it. Human characters are very complicated,
and frequently compo&s;ed of very incon&s;i&s;tent prin|ciples,
of which one actuates a per&s;on in &s;ome
parts of his conduct, and another in other parts;
and &s;ometimes all of them influence him in &s;ome
degree, in the &s;ame action. Hence it becomes often
di$$icult to form a ju&s;t idea of a man's true cha|racter.
Now the de&s;ign of &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e as we
have mentioned is, to unravel a particular cha|racter,
and point out the operation of the different
principles which are compounded in it. A cha|racter
which is to be explained, ought always to
be that of &s;ome per&s;on who is de&s;cribed, or who&s;e
hi&s;tory is recorded, in &s;cripture: for otherwi&s;e, it
will not be &s;o familiar, nor can be rendered &s;o
familiar to the audience, as to make them enter
into it, or ea&s;ily apprehend it. It is proper to give
a view of the hi&s;tory of the per&s;on who&s;e character
we de&s;ign to explain, &s;o far as it can throw any
light upon his real character; for as it is from
actions that a character appears, &s;o the hi&s;tory of
a per&s;on's actions is the only means by which we
can inve&s;tigate his character, and the principles
by which he is actuated. With the hi&s;tory of a
per&s;on's particular actions mu&s;t be joined an
<PB N="270" REF="277">
account of the principle and temper which each of
them di&s;covers or proceeds from, and the &s;tate of
mind which they &s;how a per&s;on to have been in at
the time of doing them. By this means the hearers
will be, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming a ju&s;t, and at the &s;ame
time a lively conception of the &s;everal principles
which form the character. This will prepare the
way for repre&s;enting, in an intelligible and &s;triking
manner, the whole character at once, with all the
complication and oppo&s;ition of principles which it
appears to contain. The picture of the mo&s;t
remarkable features in a character &s;hould be
attended with &s;uch ob&s;ervations as may account for
it, and explain the combination of principles, and
the degree of influence which they have in the
conduct. When the character of a particular
per&s;on, de&s;cribed in &s;cripture, is thus plainly repre|&s;ented
as &s;howing it&s;elf in his particular circum|&s;tances,
the hearers will, of them&s;elves, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, be able to di&s;cern how far it re&s;embles
their own. But, in order to enable them the
better to di&s;cern it, and to render the de&s;cription
more u&s;eful, it will be proper to repre&s;ent the
character in a more general way, or rather to &s;how
it in a variety of lights; to point out the different
forms which it a&s;&s;umes, the different ways in which
it influences the conduct, the different degrees in
which it betrays it&s;elf in common life. This will
bring it home to the hearers, and apply it directly
to their in&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278">
Sermons of this &s;ort will require a great know|lege
of human nature; but if they be properly
executed, they may often be extremely u&s;eful.
By being employed about the character of an indi|vidual,
they will give both a plain and a &s;triking
view of what is the &s;ubject of them. By analy&s;ing
that character, either as it is maintained through
life, or as it is di&s;played in a particular action,
they will lay open &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ecret windings
of the human heart, &s;ome of tho&s;e turns of mind
and temper, which have the mo&s;t exten&s;ive influ|ence
upon the &s;entiments and practice of men.</P>
<P>There are many proper &s;ubjects for &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es
to be found in holy writ; as, for example, the &s;itua|tion
of David's mind in the matter of Uriah, the
character of the proud phari&s;ee in our Saviour's
parable, and in a word, all &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as give
an opportunity of pointing out any combination of
principles, any contra&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions, or any &s;ecret
and &s;ubtle workings of human nature, in the
per&s;on to whom they refer.</P>
<P>So much for tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es which re&s;t in expli|cation
or in&s;truction, and are addre&s;&s;ed purely and
ultimately to the under&s;tanding. We &s;hall con|clude
with ob&s;erving concerning all explicatory
di&s;cour&s;es, that, as their ultimate end is inform|ation
or in&s;truction, &s;o their prevailing character
ought to be per&s;picuity. It is only by this, that
their end can be promoted; and in order to
<PB N="272" REF="279">
obtain this, the &s;entiments mu&s;t be ju&s;t and natural,
di&s;po&s;ed in a &s;imple and regular order, &s;et off with
apt and obvious illu&s;trations, and expre&s;&s;ed in
words plain and common in them&s;elves, and, as
much as po&s;&s;ible, familiar to the hearers. The
be&s;t way of attaining this per&s;picuity is to keep it
con&s;tantly in view, while we are compo&s;ing, as our
principal aim, to be under&s;tood by the hearers.
This will prevent our aiming at an o&s;tentation of
ingenuity and learning, and will make all our efforts
to centre in giving a clear view of the &s;ubject. In
order to this, the fir&s;t requi&s;ite is, that we have
a clear idea of it our&s;elves. This requires both
a con&s;iderable exactne&s;s and extent of general
knowlege, and a careful preparation for every
particular &s;ubject.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2">
<HEAD>ART. II. Of Convictive or Probatory Di&s;cour&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;econd kind of pulpit di&s;cour&s;e is that
which has for its end the proof of the truth of &s;ome
doctrine of religion. This may be called a con|victive
or probatory di&s;cour&s;e. It is addre&s;&s;ed to
rea&s;on, or to tho&s;e powers of the mind, by which
we perceive evidence, and di&s;tingui&s;h truth from
fal&s;ehood. There are many of the truths of reli|gion,
which all Chri&s;tians believe; but it is often
proper to exhibit the proofs even of the&s;e: for
though men do not di&s;believe them, a clear view
of their evidence will render their belief firmer:
though their belief be firm, yet a &s;trong perception
<PB N="273" REF="280">
of their evidence will render its influence upon the
conduct greater. Thus the proofs of a God, of a
Providence, of a future judgment, are very proper
&s;ubjects of &s;ermons to a chri&s;tian audience, who
do not doubt of any of the&s;e doctrines. As the
de&s;ign of preaching on them is, not &s;o much to
convince men of what they do not believe, as to
&s;trengthen the influence of a belief which they have
already, a preacher is not confined altogether to
the ab&s;tract and cool method of argumentation, but
may very allowably throw in whatever tends to
make the force of the argument better felt, or to
render it fitter to touch the heart. In &s;uch &s;er|mons,
therefore, a degree of ornament may be
admitted, which would be very un&s;uitable to a
philo&s;ophical examination of the evidence of prin|ciples.
Were a metaphy&s;ician, for example, to
produce a proof of the being of God, he would
&s;atisfy him&s;elf with giving a plain and conclu&s;ive
argument for it; but a preacher &s;hould &s;et that
argument in a more popular light, exhibiting it in
&s;uch a way that it may produce a &s;en&s;e of the
divine exi&s;tence, fit to remain with men, and to
influence them in life. In order to this, he mu&s;t
turn every part of it into &s;entiment; he mu&s;t &s;how
that he has him&s;elf a &s;trong conviction of it, which
may infect them with the &s;ame by &s;ympathy; he
mu&s;t not urge the argument in general, but mu&s;t
in every part of it give a view of &s;ome particular
exi&s;tence, and a lively picture of the impre&s;&s;ions
of the creator which it bears; the &s;ame proof
<PB N="274" REF="281">
which he repre&s;ents &s;o as fully to convince the
under&s;tanding, he mu&s;t make to &s;trike the imagin|ation,
and to touch the heart. Whatever be the
truth propo&s;ed to be proved, the chri&s;tian orator
will find means of &s;etting the proofs of it in this
&s;triking light. It would be ab&s;urd to attempt a
formal proof that all men are mortal; yet it is very
nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on the certainty of death, to
give men a &s;triking &s;en&s;e of it, and to detect tho&s;e
cau&s;es which make it have &s;o little influence on the
generality.</P>
<P>Even in the mo&s;t ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, it is wrong
to flay to obviate every tri$ling objection that may
be formed again&s;t the rea&s;oning. It retards the
progre&s;s, breaks the argument, and di&s;tracts the
attention. But it is &s;till more improper, when the
de&s;ign of a &s;ermon is to &s;trengthen men's conviction
of a truth which they believed before, and to
render that conviction fitter for influencing prac|tice.
In this ca&s;e, to introduce every objection,
and $word$ to an&s;wer it, mu&s;t perfectly chill the
argument, mu&s;t wholly interrupt the cour&s;e of the
thought, and render it unfit to operate either on
the imagination or the pa&s;&s;ions. Be&s;ides, as a
great part of mankind are incapable of balancing
evidence, or of weighing objections and an&s;wers
again&s;t each other, and perceiving the preponde|rance
of evidence, the multiplying of objections
in preaching will tend much more to perplex or
rai&s;e doubts, than to remove them and &s;trengthen
<PB N="275" REF="282">
conviction. They &s;hould therefore be very &s;pa|ringly
introduced in &s;uch probatory di&s;cour&s;es as
are intended to give men a &s;trong conviction or a
lively &s;en&s;e of truths which they already believe.
And by far the greate&s;t part of probatory di&s;cour&s;es
from the pulpit ought to be of this kind. The
doctrines which a preacher ought certainly to treat
mo&s;t frequently, are the great and important truths
of natural and revealed religion. The&s;e are uni|ver&s;ally
believed by tho&s;e to whom he has occa&s;ion
to preach. The greate&s;t part even of the contro|ver&s;ies
that have been rai&s;ed about the&s;e, among
the di$$erent &s;ects of Chri&s;tians, has regarded the
manner of explaining them, rather than the
truth of the doctrines them&s;elves. Yet it is nece&s;|&s;ary
to remind men of the evidences of the&s;e doc|trines,
otherwi&s;e their a&s;&s;ent to them will be very
weak. But it is proper to handle them in the
popular, &s;entimental, and &s;triking manner, which
we have pointed out, not in the accurate, dry
method of ratiocination, which would be proper
for the conviction of a per&s;on who di&s;believed
them.</P>
<P>But though this be the kind of probatory di&s;|cour&s;es
for which a preacher will have mo&s;t frequent
occa&s;ion; yet it may &s;ometimes be nece&s;&s;ary to
prove doctrines which are really denied by &s;ome of
his hearers. When doctrines of real importance are
denied, or doctrines truly pernicious and of a bad ten|dency
in life are propagated, it becomes a very proper
<PB N="276" REF="283">
end of preaching, to prove the former, and to
con$ute the latter. There will be need for di&s;|cour&s;es
of this &s;ort much more frequently in &s;ome
congregations than in others; and different &s;itua|tions
will point out different &s;ubjects as fit to be
handled in this way. But whatever be the &s;ituation
in which a mini&s;ter be placed, he &s;hould be careful
to preach in this way no more than is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary; for to dwell on the dry eviction of
mere &s;peculative and controverted points, tends to
draw men too much off from practice, to lead
them to place religion in &s;peculation, and to render
them fond of que&s;tions and fruitle&s;s di&s;putes.</P>
<P>In &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es two different methods may be
u&s;ed; the analytical, and &s;ynthetical. In the
former, the point to be proved is not explicitly
propo&s;ed, but the principles from which it is
deducible are laid down and pur&s;ued through their
&s;everal con&s;equences, till at la&s;t the point in view
appears to be evidently deducible from them.
This method is not very common in &s;ermons, and
is indeed difficult; but it is very proper when the
hearers are prejudiced, and leads them on, without
&s;u&s;picion, from one acknowleged truth to another,
till at la&s;t the conclu&s;ion breaks in unexpectedly
upon them. In the &s;ynthetical method, which is
the mo&s;t common, a propo&s;ition is explicitly laid
down, and the arguments for it profe&s;&s;edly urged.
This kind likewi&s;e admits two different methods,
an&s;wering to the two kinds of demon&s;tration in
<PB N="277" REF="284">
mathematical &s;ubjects, the direct, and the indirect.
In the former, the preacher confirms the truth, by
propo&s;ing the arguments for it in their natural
order, by which they add greate&s;t weight to one
another, He &s;hould propo&s;e them in that point
of view, in which they are lea&s;t liable to the ex|ceptions
which are made again&s;t them. When
they cannot be &s;et in &s;uch a light as to be evi|dently
not expo&s;ed to the&s;e exceptions, he mu&s;t
take notice of &s;uch exceptions as are mo&s;t material,
and &s;how that they are invalid, and that the argu|ment
again&s;t which they &s;eem to lie, is conclu&s;ive
notwith&s;tanding them.</P>
<P>Sometimes again, a probatory di&s;cour&s;e may
proceed in the indirect method of rea&s;oning.
This will be the ca&s;e, when the preacher's aim is
chiefly to confute error. Sometimes a fal&s;e opi|nion
is advanced, and by merely &s;howing that the
arguments produced for it are really inconclu&s;ive,
the oppo&s;ite truth will be &s;ufficiently &s;upported.
Sometimes a truth is not directly denied; but it is
thought to be attended with &s;uch difficulties, or
liable to &s;uch objections, as weaken men's con|viction
of it, and make them doubtful or &s;ceptical
about it. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, the mo&s;t natu|ral
way of producing a conviction of the truth, is
to proceed in the indirect way; to propo&s;e the
&s;everal arguments by which the fal&s;e opinion is
&s;upported, to &s;how that they are not &s;ufficient to
prove it, that notwith&s;tanding them, men may re|main
<PB N="278" REF="285">
convinced of the oppo&s;ite truth. It will thus
depend on the nature of the truth that is denied,
on the manner in which it is denied, and on the
particular di&s;po&s;ition of the hearers, whether it
will be mo&s;t effectually &s;upported by rea&s;oning in
the direct and o&s;ten&s;ive, or in the indirect and apo|gogical
method. To the&s;e circum&s;tances the
preacher &s;hould attend, and by them he &s;hould be
directed to the one method or the other; always
taking care to choo&s;e what will be mo&s;t effectual
in the particular ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In mathematical &s;ubjects, either of the kinds of
demon&s;tration is &s;ufficient of it&s;elf; if either be
u&s;ed, it would be &s;uperfluous to add another of
the &s;ame kind, or to &s;ubjoin a demon&s;tration of
the other kind. But religious and moral &s;ubjects
are widely different. Their evidence generally not
only ari&s;es from &s;everal arguments joined together,
but al&s;o, there are at lea&s;t appearances of argu|ment
again&s;t them. On this account, in mo&s;t
&s;ubjects of preaching, both the methods of eviction
that have been mentioned, may be very properly
united in probatory di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit.
When the di&s;cour&s;e proceeds chiefly in direct con|firmation
of the truth, by propo&s;ing the &s;everal
arguments that &s;upport it, it is highly proper, not
only to remove the exceptions brought to weaken
the &s;everal arguments, which will be be&s;t done in
pro&s;ecuting the particular argument again&s;t which
they are pointed; but al&s;o, after all the arguments
<PB N="279" REF="286">
have been pro&s;ecuted in this manner, it will be
very fit for the farther confirmation of the truth,
to an&s;wer the arguments which are produced on
the other &s;ide, and to &s;how either that they have
no real force, or that they have not force enough
to counterbalance the arguments which have been
propo&s;ed before. In like manner, when the di&s;|cour&s;e
has proceeded chiefly in the indirect way;
after having in&s;i&s;ted on all the arguments for the
fal&s;e opinion, and &s;hown them to be inconclu&s;ive,
it will add great weight to the rea&s;oning to &s;how
next, that not only is there no &s;olid argument for
it, but that there are al&s;o &s;trong arguments again&s;t
it; that not only is there no valid objection again&s;t
the truth, but al&s;o the $&s;tronge&s;t evidences for it.
Hence, every probatory di&s;cour&s;e, intended to
evince a truth di&s;believed or doubted by the hear|ers,
will properly proceed both by confirmation
and confutation; and the kinds of &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es
will be di&s;tingui&s;hed chiefly by the order in which
the&s;e &s;ucceed each other.</P>
<P>Thus probatory di&s;cour&s;es are of two kinds;
&s;uch as are de&s;igned to produce a &s;en&s;e of truths
already believed, and &s;uch as are de&s;igned to be|get
belief of truths formerly denied or doubted;
and the latter hold chiefly either of confirmation
or of confutation. We may reduce to this head
a third &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;es; &s;uch as are employed
in inve&s;tigation, or in tracing out the cau&s;es of
things; as, Why Chri&s;tianity has not, in fact, a
<PB N="280" REF="287">
greater influence on the reformation of mankind;
Why men are &s;o apt to place religion in externals;
and the like. For though &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es are not
employed in proving a particular propo&s;ition by
arguments, they con&s;i&s;t principally of rea&s;oning,
in order to convince men that the cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned
do really produce the effects taken notice of. But
as the end of all the&s;e &s;orts is the &s;ame, conviction,
&s;o there are many rules common to them all, re|&s;ulting
from this their common end. The&s;e are,
in general, the rules of right rea&s;oning, which
ought to be delivered fully in that part of philo&s;o|phy
which profe&s;&s;es to teach the art of rea&s;oning.
We cannot here enlarge upon them all; but &s;hall
only hint at a few of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of
them.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to attend, whether the point to be
proved is &s;imple or complex; if it be complex,
its &s;everal parts mu&s;t be kept in view, and the
arguments &s;upporting them, according to their
natural order, be regularly propo&s;ed. The argu|ments
which prove only one part of the propo&s;i|tion,
mu&s;t be carefully &s;eparated from tho&s;e which
prove the whole, and reduced to different cla&s;&s;es.
If tho&s;e which directly prove the &s;everal parts&punc; of
the propo&s;ition, be fir&s;t urged according to the
natural order of the&s;e parts; &s;uch arguments as
confirm the whole, will, by coming after them, be
well under&s;tood, and will, as it were, collect into
a point, and concentrate the conviction produced

by them. In other ca&s;es, it may have a good
effect to begin with the general arguments, and
then, &s;uch as particularly prove the &s;everal parts,
will &s;pread out and illuminate the conviction pro|duced
by the former. If the general truth to be
proved is pretty well under&s;tood in the gro&s;s, and
the general arguments for it are very plain, this
latter is perhaps preferable; if that truth be but
indi&s;tinctly or imperfectly conceived by the hear|ers,
or if the general arguments for it be complex,
the former manner will be mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>In order to rea&s;on well on any &s;ubject, it is fir&s;t
of all nece&s;&s;ary, that a man know what kind of
proof or evidence that &s;ubject admits of; other|wi&s;e,
he will be in danger of falling into a wrong
track, and of &s;earching out improper arguments.
On this account, that part of logic which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
evidence with accuracy into its different
kinds, and a&s;certains the proper province of each
kind, is of the greate&s;t importance, and is indeed
a proper preparation for rea&s;oning of every &s;ort.
Now, all the &s;ubjects, of which a preacher has oc|ca&s;ion
to attempt the proof, are reducible to two
kinds; &s;uch as are to be proved by rea&s;on, and
&s;uch as are to be proved by revelation. He &s;hould
content him&s;elf with whichever of the&s;e kinds the
pre&s;ent &s;ubject admits of; for to apply them in|di&s;criminately
to all &s;ubjects, would be perfectly
ab&s;urd. In proving a truth di&s;coverable by rea|&s;on,
<PB N="282" REF="289">
he mu&s;t con&s;ider what is the peculiar kind of
proof &s;uited to that truth, and exhibit it. In
proving a truth by revelation, care mu&s;t be taken
to argue, not from the $ound, but the real mean|ing.
It is proper to &s;how that the expre&s;&s;ions in
a text, which &s;eem to imply a proof of it, have
that &s;en&s;e which renders them a proof of it in
other texts; and that they art determined to this
&s;en&s;e by the context and $word$ of writing in that
particular text. When a truth $word$ a proper
proof only from rea&s;on, yet that $word$ or &s;ome
&s;teps of it, may very well be expre&s;&s;ed in th$ $ords
of &s;cripture. When a truth is to be proved only
by revelation, it may yet be very properly illu&s;|trated
from &s;uppo&s;itions of rea&s;on. Some truths
may be proved both by rea&s;on and revelation;
then, each part of the proof &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted
according to its peculiar rules. In proving from
rea&s;on, all ab&s;tru&s;e, far-fetched, and complex argu|ments
&s;hould be avoided, for they will be neither
intelligible nor convincing. In proving from &s;crip|ture,
only plain texts and fully to the purpo&s;e
&s;hould be u&s;ed; ob&s;cure texts would need long
explication before they could be applied, and am|biguous
ones will promote doubt, in&s;tead of di&s;|pelling
it. In proving from either, only &s;uch ar|guments
&s;hould be u&s;ed as are truly conclu&s;ive;
a few of the&s;e will be &s;ufficient to produce con|viction;
but a weak argument always debilitates
the &s;tronger ones. Every argument, from what|ever
<PB N="283" REF="290">
&s;ource it be derived, &s;hould be exhibited as
&s;hortly as can be, without detracting from its
force; for thus its whole force will be be&s;t repre|&s;ented
at once. Care &s;hould likewi&s;e be taken
not to urge too great a multiplicity of arguments,
for this would only confound the judgement and
burden the memory. It is much better to make
a &s;election of tho&s;e which will be mo&s;t ea&s;ily com|prehended,
and are mo&s;t undoubtedly conclu&s;ive;
the&s;e will be &s;ufficient to produce conviction, and
more would rather tire, than &s;trengthen the con|viction.
In other ca&s;es, it may be proper to di&s;|tribute
the arguments into different cla&s;&s;es, which,
like a projection in architecture, will take off from
the ill effect of the number, and enable the mind
to comprehend them without difficulty or di&s;gu&s;t.
All the doctrines of true religion are of a practical
nature, and ought to be always repre&s;ented as
&s;ub&s;ervient to practice. Even in a di&s;cour&s;e there|fore,
intended mainly for proving a doctrine, its
influence on practice ought to be pointed out.
When the di&s;cour&s;e is of the fir&s;t kind, de&s;igned
to produce a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of a doctrine already
believed, it has been formerly ob&s;erved, that the
whole argument &s;hould be carried on in &s;uch a
way as to touch the heart. But be&s;ides this, every
probatory di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould conclude with pointing
out its influence on practice. Sometimes this may
be done, by enforcing from it &s;ome one virtue to
which it is principally &s;ub&s;ervient. Sometimes,
when the doctrine proved, enforces equally &s;e|veral
<PB N="284" REF="291">
duties, the obligation which it lays us under
to all the&s;e, may be pointed out in di&s;tinct infer|ences
or deductions.</P>

<HEAD>ART. III. Of Panegyrical or Demon&s;trative Di&s;cour&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE third &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;es are &s;uch as are ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to the imagination, and are intended to
rai&s;e admiration. A preacher may, without de|viating
from the end of his vocation, endeavour to
enrapture his audience with this plea&s;ure. The
rea&s;on is, that admiration tends naturally and im|mediately
to produce imitation, and to excite noble
ambition and emulation. The preacher &s;eems to
aim only at making a character admired; he em|ploys
all the means which can promote this end;
but he &s;eeks the admiration of his hearers only for
the &s;ake of its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences; yet as no|thing
farther is requi&s;ite for &s;ecuring the&s;e, but
exciting admiration, this may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered
as the di&s;tingui&s;hing aim of &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>The ancient Rhetoricians take notice of this
&s;pecies of di&s;cour&s;es, and call them Panegyrical or
Demon&s;trative. They allow two &s;orts of them;
one employed in prai&s;ing, another in blaming.
Chri&s;tian charity &s;carcely allows one of the latter
&s;ort to be brought to the pulpit; it &s;eems to forbid
making it the whole purpo&s;e of a di&s;cour&s;e, to de|&s;cribe
and exaggerate, as it were, all the vices of
one particular per&s;on, It is more &s;uitable, to re|pre&s;ent,
<PB N="285" REF="292">
in the faire&s;t point of view, eminent virtue
and goodne&s;s. There are many &s;ubjects on which
&s;uch di&s;cour&s;es may be properly compo&s;ed by a
Prote&s;tant preacher; as the life of our Saviour,
and the lives of tho&s;e holy men who&s;e hi&s;tory is
recorded in &s;cripture. We are expre&s;sly com|manded
to follow the&s;e examples; and therefore
it mu&s;t be highly proper to propo&s;e their examples
to a chri&s;tian audience.</P>
<P>A demon&s;trative di&s;cour&s;e bears &s;ome analogy
to the la&s;t kind of explicatory di&s;cour&s;e which was
explained, as a character is the &s;ubject of both.
But they are con&s;iderably different. The de&s;ign
of the one is from the actions to deduce a di&s;tinct
analy&s;is of the character; the de&s;ign of the other
is to repre&s;ent the character and the actions in &s;uch
a light as may mo&s;t effectually promote imitation.
The true way of doing this is to paint the whole
man, and to &s;et him before the hearer's eyes,
&s;peaking and acting. In de&s;cribing the cour&s;e of
his life, the preacher &s;hould chiefly point out tho&s;e
pa&s;&s;ages in which his virtues be&s;t appeared. He
&s;hould recount his laudable actions: this gives
force to a panegyric; this is what in&s;tructs people,
and makes an impre&s;&s;ion on their minds. This is
to paint a per&s;on to the life, and &s;hows what he was
in every period, in every condition, and in the
mo&s;t remarkable junctures of his life. At the
&s;ame time, a demon&s;trative di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould not be
a &s;imple narration. It is enough to &s;elect the
<PB N="286" REF="293">
chief facts, and repre&s;ent them in a conci&s;e, lively,
and &s;triking manner. There &s;hould be the &s;ame
difference between a mere hi&s;tory and a di&s;cour&s;e
of this kind, as between a natural hi&s;tory of an
animal and a poetical de&s;cription of it. The
former de&s;cribes minutely every particular regard|ing
it; the latter choo&s;es a few of the mo&s;t remark|able
particulars, and, by combining them, ex|hibits
a plea&s;ing and &s;triking picture of the object
to the imagination. It is never allowable to exceed
the bounds of truth; but the end of this di&s;cour&s;e
requires that the virtues of a per&s;on &s;hould be &s;et in
the mo&s;t amiable and engaging light that truth will
permit; and that the faults which were blended
with the&s;e virtues &s;hould be either wholly omitted,
or touched as &s;lightly as po&s;&s;ible. This is evidently
the way to excite admiration, and to promote
imitation; and it is plainly allowable, becau&s;e the
preacher's profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign is, not to give a hi&s;tory
of the per&s;on, but to exhibit his example &s;o far as
it is worthy of imitation. This &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e
&s;hould never be allowed to run into the florid;
but it may approach nearer to it, and be more
adorned with bold figures, than any other &s;ort of
&s;ermon. A good deal of this is really nece&s;&s;ary
for attaining its end.</P>
<P>Demon&s;trative di&s;cour&s;es may be di&s;tingui&s;hed
into three kinds. The &s;ubject of the fir&s;t is a
per&s;on's whole life. Such a di&s;cour&s;e as this will
exhibit a lively picture of all the virtues which a
<PB N="287" REF="294">
per&s;on has exerci&s;ed, in all the different periods,
and in all the various &s;ituations and emergencies of
life. The &s;ubject of the &s;econd kind is one period
of a holy man's life; it may exhibit all the virtues
which he exerci&s;ed, in all the different &s;ituations in
which he was placed during that period. Thus a
di&s;cour&s;e may be employed in exhibiting Jo&s;eph's
example before his advancement to the govern|ment
of Egypt; or in di&s;playing his example after
his advancement The life of Paul after his con|ver&s;ion
is another in&s;tance of this kind of di&s;cour&s;e.
The third &s;pecies is that which has for its &s;ubject a
particular virtue, as di&s;played in various circum|&s;tances
through the whole of a man's life; as the
patience of Job, the faith of Abraham. The&s;e
three kinds of demon&s;trative &s;ermons di$fer only
in the extent of their &s;ubject; their end and
general rules are almo&s;t wholly the &s;ame; they
can &s;carce differ in any other re&s;pect than the
divi&s;ion of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible. The fir&s;t
kind, which takes in a whole life, may be pro&s;e|cuted
in two different methods. 1. The life may
be divided into its different periods, and the virtues
di&s;played in each period exhibited to the view of
the hearers. By this means, each member will
become a di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;econd &s;pecies. 2. It
may be divided according to the different virtues
which appear in it; and the di&s;cour&s;e may &s;how
how each-virtue &s;eparately has been exerci&s;ed and
di&s;played through all the different periods and
&s;ituations in which the per&s;on has been placed.
<PB N="288" REF="295">
In this way, the example of Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented
in <HI>The Life of God in the Soul of Man,</HI> as redu|cible
to piety, charity, purity, and humility; and
the pro&s;ecution of this &s;ubject, in the fir&s;t part of
that book, is not a bad example of a di&s;cour&s;e of
this kind. This &s;ort of divi&s;ion has &s;ome advan|tages,
e&s;pecially when a per&s;on's &s;ituation has not
undergone very great changes. The only incon|venience
that attends it is, that &s;ometimes different
virtues are complicated in the &s;ame action; but
this is not of great con&s;equence, for that action
may be introduced under that virtue which is
predominant in it; and all the other virtues which
likewi&s;e appeared in it, may be at the &s;ame time
pointed out without any breach of method. And
to compen&s;ate this, one has an opportunity, by
pur&s;uing this method, to exhibit every virtue of
the per&s;on's life entire, and in all the different
points of light in which the per&s;on had, through
his whole life, occa&s;ion to exert it. When this
method is pur&s;ued, every part of the di&s;cour&s;e
becomes a demon&s;trative di&s;cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ort.
In this &s;pecies &s;ometimes, but often in the two la&s;t,
no divi&s;ion is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; it is enough
that the &s;everal actions of a per&s;on be repre&s;ented
in a natural order. In the &s;econd &s;pecies, where
the &s;ubject is &s;ome period of a life, if the preacher
choo&s;e a divi&s;ion, it may mo&s;t naturally be made
according to the different virtues which a per&s;on
has had occa&s;ion to &s;how in that period. In the
third &s;pecies again, where one particular virtue is
<PB N="289" REF="296">
the &s;ubject, the divi&s;ion may be according to the
different periods or &s;ituations in which that virtue
has been exerci&s;ed. There are many &s;ermons
extant, which are in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the demon|&s;trative
kind; as all tho&s;e on the example of
Chri&s;t. But few or none of them are pro&s;ecuted
according to the accurate rules of &s;uch compo|&s;itions.</P>
<P>In a word, it is the de&s;ign of a demon&s;trative
or panegyrical &s;ermon, at once to give a di&s;tinct
knowlege, and to excite high admiration of the
virtues of a particular per&s;on, with a view to
promote the imitation of them, by giving a lively
view of the&s;e virtues as di&s;played in a &s;eries of
actions.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="4">
<HEAD>ART. IV. Of Sua&s;ory Di&s;cour&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>The la&s;t kind of pulpit di&s;cour&s;e is addre&s;&s;ed to
the pa&s;&s;ions and the will; its end is per&s;ua&s;ion;
we may therefore call it the &s;ua&s;ory. This is of
all the mo&s;t complex kind; it includes all the re&s;t,
or at lea&s;t it pre&s;uppo&s;es in&s;truction, conviction,
and plea&s;ing, and &s;uperadds &s;omething to them
which is peculiar to it&s;elf, and con&s;titutes its
di&s;tingui&s;hing criterion. A &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e is
intended to per&s;uade men to a certain cour&s;e; and
in order to an&s;wer its end, it mu&s;t di&s;cover what
that cour&s;e is; it mu&s;t prove that it is &s;ub&s;ervient
to &s;ome end acknowleged to be of importance by
the hearers; and that end mu&s;t be &s;o repre&s;ented
<PB N="290" REF="297">
to the imagination, that it may excite a &s;trong
affection to it, by means of which the will may be
determined to the cour&s;e which leads to it.</P>
<P>In order to per&s;uade a man to any cour&s;e, the
under&s;tanding mu&s;t be addre&s;&s;ed &s;o far, as to let
him both know what the cour&s;e is that you want
him to pur&s;ue, and to convince him that his pur|&s;uing
that cour&s;e will an&s;wer &s;ome good end. It
is po&s;&s;ible indeed to move men, without enlighten|ing
them; but this emotion is a mere temporary
pa&s;&s;ion, which neither has any fixed direction, nor
can an&s;wer any purpo&s;e. If you would move a
man with any thing beyond &s;uch a tran&s;ient emo|tion,
if you would truly per&s;uade him, you mu&s;t
enlighten as well as move. You mu&s;t not only let
him know what is the cour&s;e which you would
have him to take, but al&s;o &s;how the rea&s;on why he
&s;hould take it. In every &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e, there|fore,
there mu&s;t be rea&s;oning or argument u&s;ed,
in order to convince the hearers that they ought
to do what you recommend to them; and till they
be thus convinced, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they can do
it. A rea&s;onable being always propo&s;es &s;ome end,
and it is for &s;ome end that he does every action,
and either indulges or curbs any di&s;po&s;ition. The
rea&s;oning, therefore, which can contribute to
per&s;uade men to any action or any cour&s;e, is of
that particular kind which &s;hows that action or
cour&s;e to be conducive to a certain end or purpo&s;e.
To per&s;uade men to holine&s;s and virtue, one may,
<PB N="291" REF="298">
for in&s;tance, prove that it is conducive to peace of
mind, to pre&s;ent intere&s;t, or to future happine&s;s.
This can be proved only by rea&s;oning or argument.
If the arguments produced do not convince men
that holine&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e ends, they can
have no tendency to per&s;uade them; however
much they may de&s;ire the ends, and however
willing they may be to pur&s;ue them, yet they will
not be prevailed on to pur&s;ue them in this way,
except they be convinced that this way leads to
the attainment of them, and is nece&s;&s;ary for
it. Thus the judgement mu&s;t be convinced by
proper arguments, before men can be excited
to any action. Solid rea&s;oning is therefore one
e&s;&s;ential ingredient in that eloquence which tends
to per&s;ua&s;ion. But this is not alone &s;ufficient for
per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to render the hearers
fond of the end, to which the cour&s;e recommended
is repre&s;ented as &s;ub&s;ervient. Though a man be
ever &s;o much convinced that a certain action will
redound to his honour, for in&s;tance, yet he will
never think of doing that action, if he has no
de&s;ire of honour. To under&s;tand, therefore, what
more than mere rea&s;oning is nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;ua&s;ion,
we need only con&s;ider, what principles of the mind
they are that attach men to the ends which they
pur&s;ue. They are, in general, the affections and
practical principles of human nature. Con&s;cience
renders the doing our duty, and obtaining the
<PB N="292" REF="299">
approbation of our own minds, a de&s;irable end to
us. Self-love makes us fond of happine&s;s, and
ready to do what is nece&s;&s;ary for obtaining it.
Ambition attaches us to honour. Gratitude di&s;|po&s;es
us to what will be agreeable to a benefactor;
benevolence, to what will tend to the happine&s;s of
others; and &s;o in other ca&s;es. Now, to per&s;uade
to a certain cour&s;e, we mu&s;t excite tho&s;e affections
or principles, which attach men to tho&s;e ends
from which our topics of argument are deduced.
Would we, for example, per&s;uade men to holine&s;s,
from its nece&s;&s;ity in order to obtain the heavenly
happine&s;s, we mu&s;t not only prove that it is nece&s;|&s;ary
for this, but al&s;o render them de&s;irous of the
heavenly happine&s;s. Would we excite them to
virtue, from gratitude to God our benefactor, who
requires it, we mu&s;t not only prove that it is the
propere&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of gratitude, but al&s;o we mu&s;t
excite in them a di&s;po&s;ition to be grateful. But as
it is thus nece&s;&s;ary to excite the pa&s;&s;ions, as well as
to convince the judgment, &s;o the former will not
be &s;ufficient alone without the latter. Let any
pa&s;&s;ion be ever &s;o &s;trong in a man's mind, it will
not lead him to any particular cour&s;e, except he
be convinced that that cour&s;e tends to gratify it.
You may rai&s;e in a man the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire of
heaven; but this de&s;ire will not incline him to
practi&s;e holine&s;s, till you have likewi&s;e convinced
him that holine&s;s is the way to heaven. Thus
neither argument alone, nor moving the pa&s;&s;ions
alone, is &s;ufficient. The cool rea&s;oner, who con|fines
<PB N="293" REF="300">
him&s;elf to the former, may convince men
that certain actions are nece&s;&s;ary to certain ends;
but he does not excite their de&s;ire of the&s;e ends.
The warm preacher, who has no &s;olid argument,
may rai&s;e a violent emotion, a pre&s;ent de&s;ire of a
certain end; but he does not point out the means
by which it may be attained; or, if he mention
them, he does not &s;ufficiently evince their ne|ce&s;&s;ity;
and therefore, the emotion which he rai&s;ed
has no fixed direction, but evaporates without de|termining
men to any &s;ettled cour&s;e. The latter
warms without enlightening; the former enlightens
without warming. Both perform but half the bu|&s;ine&s;s
of per&s;ua&s;ion. To complete it, the judge|ment
mu&s;t be convinced and the pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;ed at
one and the &s;ame time. When this is done, the
will is immediately determined to re&s;olve on the
cour&s;e, and to perform the action recommended.
Affection makes us de&s;irous of the end; rea&s;on
&s;hows us that we mu&s;t do certain actions for ob|taining
it; and as &s;oon as this is perceived, affection
urges us to will the doing of that action; and when
we are brought to will it, per&s;ua&s;ion is accom|pli&s;hed,
and we immediately do the action. A
&s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e is, therefore, directly addre&s;&s;ed
to the will; its de&s;ign is to &s;eize and captivate the
will, and lead it to exert it&s;elf in an effectual vo|lition
of the cour&s;e recommended. And this is
attained by convincing the hearers that that cour&s;e
is nece&s;&s;ary for a certain end, and rai&s;ing, at the
&s;ame time, a &s;trong affection to that end. The
<PB N="294" REF="301">
preacher who can frame his di&s;cour&s;e &s;o as to pro|duce
the&s;e two effects at once, will be a ma&s;ter of
per&s;ua&s;ion, and attain that vehemence which is
the noble&s;t &s;pecies of eloquence, its very &s;ummit
and perfection.</P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved, how one of the parts
of per&s;ua&s;ion is to be performed; the judgement
is to be convinced by &s;olid rea&s;oning. It will now
be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;how how the pa&s;&s;ions may be
rai&s;ed; for in rai&s;ing them, the other part of per|&s;ua&s;ion
con&s;i&s;ts. Now, there are only two ways
by which any pa&s;&s;ion or affection can be produced;
either by giving an actual perception of the object
of that pa&s;&s;ion, or by pre&s;enting a lively idea of
that object. The actual pre&s;ence of the object of
a pa&s;&s;ion never fails to excite the pa&s;&s;ion; the
feeling of pain produces &s;orrow; the &s;ight of di&s;|tre&s;s
rai&s;es our &s;ympathy. But it is &s;eldom that a
preacher can pre&s;ent the objects them&s;elves to his
hearers; if their affections could be rai&s;ed only by
the actual pre&s;ence of their objects, it would be out
of his power to rai&s;e them in mo&s;t ca&s;es. But God
has wi&s;ely con&s;tituted us in &s;uch a way, that the
&s;everal pa&s;&s;ions and affections of our nature may
be likewi&s;e rai&s;ed by &s;trong and lively ideas of
their objects. Thus, the certainty of a very great
calamity will rai&s;e &s;orrow, before we actually en|dure
it; a de&s;cription of deep di&s;tre&s;s will excite
our compa&s;&s;ion to the per&s;on who &s;uffers it; merely
thinking of a favour will rai&s;e gratitude to the au|thor
<PB N="295" REF="302">
of it. It is by this way that the preacher has
acce&s;s to the hearts of his hearers; he can rai&s;e
their pa&s;&s;ions only by pre&s;enting to them &s;trong
and lively ideas of the objects of them. As it is
the imagination of the hearers that conceives the&s;e
lively ideas, &s;o it is by addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to their
imagination, that the preacher pre&s;ents the&s;e ideas
to them. All the pa&s;&s;ions take their ri&s;e from the
imagination, and it is by fir&s;t touching the ima|gination,
that we mu&s;t, by means of it, move the
pa&s;&s;ions. In order therefore to explain how the
pa&s;&s;ions are rai&s;ed, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider
how the imagination is addre&s;&s;ed, and what kind
of addre&s;s to it has an influence on the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Now, every de&s;cription which tends to plea&s;e
any of our internal or reflex &s;en&s;es, is addre&s;&s;ed to
the imagination; whatever is new, beautiful, ele|gant,
harmonious, or &s;ublime, gratifies the ima|gination;
and every de&s;cription of &s;uch objects is
addre&s;&s;ed to it. Every &s;uch de&s;cription is admitted
into poetry, which re&s;ts in gratifying the imagin|ation,
and who&s;e end is to plea&s;e. But there are
&s;ome objects which, however much a lively de|&s;cription
of them may gratify the imagination, have
no tendency to influence the pa&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e they
are not the cau&s;e or the object of any pa&s;&s;ion.
Such de&s;criptions therefore cannot enter into &s;ua|&s;ory
di&s;cour&s;es; they have no tendency to promote
the end of them; they would rather ob&s;truct it, by
fixing the mind upon &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="303">
Again, &s;ome de&s;criptions even of tho&s;e things
which are the natural objects and cau&s;es of our
pa&s;&s;ions, are unfit to excite them. If they be &s;o
florid and gaudy as to amu&s;e or dazzle the mind,
it will re&s;t in the amu&s;ement which they give,
without feeling, any di&s;po&s;ition to be actuated by
the pa&s;&s;ion which the&s;e objects might have rai&s;ed.
The de&s;cription may be very beautiful in it&s;elf,
but it does not &s;uit its place, nor contribute to the
end to which it ought to have been &s;ubordinate.
The de&s;criptions then which, in a &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e,
are addre&s;&s;ed to the imagination, mu&s;t be &s;o con|trived
as to &s;et tho&s;e objects and cau&s;es of our
pa&s;&s;ions, of which they are de&s;criptions, in that
point of view in which they have the &s;tronge&s;t
tendency to excite the pa&s;&s;ions. In order to this,
the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves, with their objects and
effects, mu&s;t be well painted. The mo&s;t &s;triking
circum&s;tances of the objects and effects mu&s;t be
repre&s;ented in &s;o lively a manner, that the hearer
may almo&s;t fancy that he &s;ees them. The work|ings
of the pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be repre&s;ented &s;o naturally,
as to make them think that they &s;ee one actuated
by it, and as may turn the lively idea of it which
they form, into the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf. Metaphors,
&s;imilitudes, images, abrupt and &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions,
rightly cho&s;en and applied, and, in a word, many
of the figures of eloquence, are &s;ub&s;ervient to this.
Till a &s;trong idea of the object, effects and work|ings
of the pa&s;&s;ion, be in this way imprinted on the
imagination, the preacher's di&s;cour&s;e cannot excite
<PB N="297" REF="304">
the pa&s;&s;ions of the hearers. But, if he can con|vey
&s;uch a &s;trong idea, the pa&s;&s;ion will immediately
ri&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly and without more ado.</P>
<P>Thus we have endeavoured to analy&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion,
to &s;how all that it includes, and all that is nece&s;&s;ary
for accompli&s;hing it. Per&s;ua&s;ion always tends to
&s;ome action or cour&s;e of action; it operates ulti|mately
on the will, which is the immediate cau&s;e
of action; but in order to determine the will, it
mu&s;t previou&s;ly convince the judgement, &s;trike the
imagination, and move the pa&s;&s;ions. A preacher
would per&s;uade men to a certain conduct; in order
to do this, he mu&s;t convince them by argument and
rea&s;oning, that that conduct tends to &s;ome valuable
end; he mu&s;t likewi&s;e bring them to perceive and
feel that that end is really valuable, by painting it
in lively colours: this picture will of cour&s;e rai&s;e
the pa&s;&s;ion or affection which attaches to this end;
and an affection for the end immediately determines
the will to pur&s;ue that cour&s;e which was &s;hown by
rea&s;oning to be nece&s;&s;ary for the attainment of the
end. All this is requi&s;ite; if any &s;tep of it be
wanting, per&s;ua&s;ion cannot be accompli&s;hed: the
di&s;cour&s;e may an&s;wer other ends, but it cannot
an&s;wer this particular end, per&s;ua&s;ion. If it con|tain
only argument, it will convince; if it contain
only gaudy painting of objects unconnected with
the pa&s;&s;ions, it will plea&s;e; if it contain only proper
pictures of the objects, effects and workings of the
pa&s;&s;ions, but without a mixture of rea&s;oning, it
<PB N="298" REF="305">
will be pathetic, it will move the pa&s;&s;ions. But
in all the&s;e ca&s;es it falls &s;hort of per&s;ua&s;ion. To
accompli&s;h this, argument, painting, and the pa|thetic,
mu&s;t be combined.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ake of di&s;tinctne&s;s, to
con&s;ider the&s;e parts of per&s;ua&s;ion &s;eparately. But
we mu&s;t not imagine that they are to be kept per|fectly
&s;eparate in a &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e. We are not
fir&s;t to prove by cool rea&s;oning, that a cour&s;e tends
to a certain end, and then with warmth to rai&s;e an
affection to that end; nor are we fir&s;t to rai&s;e a
&s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for the end, and then when we have
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the hearers with it, to convince them by
cool rea&s;oning that, if they would gratify that
pa&s;&s;ion and obtain the end, they mu&s;t take the
cour&s;e which we recommend. If we were to keep
the two parts of per&s;ua&s;ion, argument, and the
pathetic, in which la&s;t painting is evidently implied,
thus entirely di&s;tinct and &s;eparate, the effect of the
one mu&s;t be lo&s;t and wear wholly off, before we
came to the other; each would be weakened by
their divorce; and the two parts of the di&s;cour&s;e
would appear unlike and un&s;uitable to each other.
The argument and the pathetic mu&s;t be in &s;ome
degree interwoven and incorporated together
through the whole di&s;cour&s;e. It is not indeed
nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould prevail equally in every
part of it; &s;ometimes the one, &s;ometimes the other
will preponderate; generally, argument &s;hould
prevail in the former part, and the pathetic in the
<PB N="299" REF="306">
latter, though this does not hold without exception.
But whichever prevails, there mu&s;t, through the
whole, be a mixture of the other. The argument
mu&s;t not be pur&s;ued in the &s;ame unaffecting way,
as if it were intended only for conviction, but
mu&s;t be intermixed all along with &s;uch lively and
pathetic de&s;criptions as may gently touch the
pa&s;&s;ions, and prepare them for ri&s;ing, when they
come to be more profe&s;&s;edly addre&s;&s;ed. The rea|&s;oning
which evinces that the cour&s;e recommended
tends to a valuable end, mu&s;t be &s;o contrived as,
at the &s;ame time, to rai&s;e &s;ome degree of affection
to that end. In like manner, that part of the di&s;|cour&s;e
which is intended chiefly to rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions,
mu&s;t be &s;o contrived as to pre&s;erve all along the
conviction ari&s;ing from the argument. The co|lours
by which the end is rendered affecting, mu&s;t
be intermixed with &s;uch hints of the argument, as
may keep in view that cour&s;e by which the pa&s;&s;ion
rai&s;ed by the end may be gratified. A preacher
who would per&s;uade, mu&s;t thus addre&s;s at one and
the &s;ame time all the powers of human nature, the
under&s;tanding, the imagination, and the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is evident from what has been &s;aid, that an
addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions is nece&s;&s;ary in a di&s;cour&s;e
who&s;e end is per&s;ua&s;ion. But if a di&s;cour&s;e con|tained
only an addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions, its end would
be properly, not per&s;ua&s;ion, but moving. And
it was ob&s;erved before, that merely to move, is not
a proper aim in a di&s;cour&s;e from the pulpit, except
<PB N="300" REF="307">
in &s;ome very particular ca&s;es. But as it is allow|able
in &s;ome ca&s;es, it will be proper ju&s;t to remark
what it is that forms the moving, as di&s;tingui&s;hed
from the vehement or per&s;ua&s;ive. This latter re|&s;ults
from the union of rea&s;oning with painting.
Now, if the former of the&s;e ingredients be re|moved,
if the di&s;cour&s;e contain only moving pic|tures
of the object of any pa&s;&s;ion, without any
rea&s;oning concerning the way of exerting that
pa&s;&s;ion, it will produce the pure pathetic; a certain
pa&s;&s;ion or affection will be rai&s;ed by it, but the
mind will not be determined by that di&s;cour&s;e to
exert the pa&s;&s;ion in any particular way. Again;
all our pa&s;&s;ions do not lead equally to action;
&s;ome of them lead to it very directly, as de&s;ire,
aver&s;ion, benevolence, anger; &s;ome &s;eem to lead
rather to inaction, or at lea&s;t lead very faintly to
action, as joy, &s;orrow, &amp;c. If a di&s;cour&s;e tend
chiefly to rai&s;e tho&s;e of the latter kind, it will be
properly pathetic; accordingly, this term is very
commonly re&s;tricted to &s;uch compo&s;itions as tend
to produce &s;orrow.</P>
<P>It is, I know, an opinion entertained by &s;ome,
that a preacher ought not to addre&s;s him&s;elf at all
to the pa&s;&s;ions of his hearers, but only to their
rea&s;on. It is alleged, that to move their pa&s;&s;ions;
is to put a bias upon their judgement, to mi&s;lead
them, and to rai&s;e an emotion which will be tran|&s;ient,
and wear off without leaving any good effect.
But this opinion can proceed only from want of
<PB N="301" REF="308">
attention, or from very &s;uperficial reflection. In
matters of mere &s;peculation, it is indeed wrong to
work upon men's pa&s;&s;ions; but wherever action
is concerned, the coole&s;t &s;peaker addre&s;&s;es the
pa&s;&s;ions of men; and indeed, unle&s;s he &s;peak to
their pa&s;&s;ions, he cannot &s;peak to any purpo&s;e at
all. No argument can be propo&s;ed for any cour&s;e
of action, but what implies an addre&s;s to &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ion
or affection. If a man tell me, it is for my
intere&s;t, he addre&s;&s;es my &s;elf-love; if for my
honour, he addre&s;&s;es my ambition; if for the public
good, he addre&s;&s;es my benevolence; in a word,
whatever motive can be propo&s;ed, it addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf
to &s;ome one of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions or affections which
are the only principles of our actions. Suppo&s;e a
per&s;on de&s;titute of the&s;e, and the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;oning
will have no effect upon him. If I &s;hould prove
clearly and convincingly, that a certain action
tends to happine&s;s, this will have no influence on
a per&s;on de&s;titute of &s;elf-love. If I prove that an
action tends to honour, a per&s;on void of ambition
would tell me, I am convinced it does, but I have
no de&s;ire of honour. The&s;e principles cannot be
di&s;puted; and when they are admitted, to &s;ay that
a preacher &s;hould confine him&s;elf to cool rea&s;oning,
and not addre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions of his hearers, is to
&s;ay, that he &s;hould excite them to action, without
applying to the only principles of their nature
which can excite them to action; or rather it is to
&s;ay, that he &s;hould addre&s;s the&s;e principles, but
that he mu&s;t be careful to addre&s;s them only in
<PB N="302" REF="309">
&s;uch a way as has no tendency to engage them.
This is a plain ab&s;urdity, though it be &s;ometimes
expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch terms as to give it &s;ome &s;how of
plau&s;ibility. Rea&s;oning which tends to &s;how that
a cour&s;e is conducive to intere&s;t or honour, will
have &s;ome influence in determining tho&s;e to that
cour&s;e, who have previou&s;ly &s;elf-love or ambition
in a con&s;iderable degree of &s;trength; but if the&s;e
principles be weak, or be counteracted by other
principles, it will have no influence upon them.
But even when the&s;e principles are weak, or &s;o
overborne by oppo&s;ite principles as to be hindered
from exerting them&s;elves, they may be excited
and &s;trengthened by a proper addre&s;s to the
pa&s;&s;ions. The want of this mu&s;t therefore be an
e&s;&s;ential defect in a di&s;cour&s;e intended for per|&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having thus laid open the general principles of
&s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;es, we &s;hall now point out briefly
their different kinds. They are plainly di&s;tingui&s;h|able
into two kinds. 1. Such as are de&s;igned to
di&s;&s;uade from vice. In order to do this, two
things are nece&s;&s;ary; to weaken the pa&s;&s;ions which
lead to vice, and to &s;tir up and &s;trengthen &s;uch
pa&s;&s;ions or affections as may oppo&s;e and check
the&s;e. To di&s;&s;uade from intemperance, for in|&s;tance,
one may give &s;uch a view of &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ure
as tends to check the de&s;ire of it; and he may
give &s;uch a view of the plea&s;ure and reward of
ab&s;tinence, or of the mi&s;ery and puni&s;hment of
<PB N="303" REF="310">
intemperance, as may rai&s;e de&s;ire of the former,
and dread of the latter, for antagoni&s;ts to &s;en&s;ual
appetite. A pa&s;&s;ion is weakened by methods con|trary
to tho&s;e by which it is rai&s;ed. All that
belongs to this &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e is therefore ea&s;ily
deducible from the principles which have been
already laid down.&mdash;2. Such as are de&s;igned to
per&s;uade to virtue. In the&s;e too, it is nece&s;&s;ary
both to &s;trengthen virtuous affections, and tho&s;e
principles which co-operate with them, and to
weaken &s;uch vicious pa&s;&s;ions and principles as
would draw off from the cour&s;e recommended.</P>
<P>In &s;ua&s;ory as well as in probatory di&s;cour&s;es, one
may proceed either in the direct or indirect method
of rea&s;oning; either by urging direct arguments
for any cour&s;e of virtue, or again&s;t any cour&s;e of
vice, or by removing the pretences by which men
commonly prevail upon them&s;elves to neglect the
virtue or indulge the vice, or excu&s;e them&s;elves in
doing &s;o. Thus a &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e intended to
prevail on men not to delay repentance, might pro|ceed
either by proving directly the danger of
delaying it, from the difficulty of religion, from
the continual increa&s;e of the &s;trength of vicious
habits, from the uncertainty of life, &amp;c. or by
removing the excu&s;es which men plead for delay|ing
it, from mi&s;taken notions of grace, from want
of lei&s;ure at pre&s;ent, &amp;c.&mdash;Sua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;es may
be again divided in another view; into &s;uch as
per&s;uade to virtue in general, or di&s;&s;uade from
<PB N="304" REF="311">
vice in general, and &s;uch as have for their object
&s;ome one particular virtue or vice. The&s;e kinds
differ only in the extent of their &s;ubject, not at all
in the rules of pro&s;ecu$ing them. It will be &s;uffi|cient
therefore to ob&s;erve on this head, that,
becau&s;e men are little affected with generals, it
will be often nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cend to particular
virtues and vices, and labour to inculcate a due
conduct with regard to them. If a mini&s;ter
employ him&s;elf only in recommending religion and
holine&s;s in general, men will have no di&s;tinct
conception of what is included in them, and every
per&s;on will find it very ea&s;y to &s;atisfy him&s;elf that
he is not defective. But when particular branches
of conduct are made the frequent &s;ubjects of preach|ing,
men will more readily di&s;cover their own
faults, and by this means be laid open to the full
force of all the arguments that are u&s;ed. Whether
a general cour&s;e of conduct, or a particular branch
of it, be the &s;ubject of a &s;ermon, that &s;ermon
may be employed in enforcing it, either from all
the topics that recommend it, or from &s;ome one
cla&s;s of topics. The&s;e two differ likewi&s;e only in
the extent of the &s;ubject, and therefore admit the
very &s;ame rules. It is only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve,
that wherever different arguments, deduced either
from the &s;ame or different topics, are u&s;ed in a
di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;hould be placed in &s;uch an order,
that each may appear to &s;pring naturally from the
foregoing, 'and that all may lend the greate&s;t
&s;trength to one another.&mdash;I &s;hall mention but one
<PB N="305" REF="312">
divi&s;ion more of &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;es. Some of them
recommend one cour&s;e from a variety of topics;
others of them recommend a variety of cour&s;es
from one and the &s;ame topic. The examples that
we have already hinted at, are all in&s;tances of the
former kind. For an in&s;tance of the latter, we
may &s;uppo&s;e the preacher, from this &s;ingle topic,
the con&s;ideration of death as our departure from
this world, urging his hearers not to &s;et an immo|derate
value on pre&s;ent earthly things, not to enter|tain
an immoderate fondne&s;s for them, not to
employ endle&s;s labour about them, not to de&s;pi&s;e
tho&s;e who are in lower worldly circum&s;tances than
them&s;elves, not to abu&s;e their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
not to commit &s;in in order to avoid the lo&s;s of
them, not to murmur for the want of them, not
to be impatient under real and po&s;itive afflictions,
not to envy others. There are many &s;ubjects
which naturally direct a preacher to follow this
method in a &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e upon them.</P>
<P>We have not con&s;idered the &s;everal-branches of
that divi&s;ion of pulpit di&s;cour&s;es which we deduced
from the ends of &s;peaking; and this divi&s;ion has
given us an opportunity of propo&s;ing the general
rules of each kind of di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o far as they ari&s;e
from its peculiar end. There is nothing that can
come within the province of a preacher, that is not
reducible to one or other of the kinds which we
have de&s;cribed. And there is none of the&s;e kinds
<PB N="306" REF="313">
which does not properly belong to his province.
Indeed, all the&s;e aims are con&s;tantly con&s;idered as
belonging to a preacher. There is but one re&s;pect
in which the manner of their belonging to him is
generally con&s;idered as different from that manner
in which we have repre&s;ented them. We have
con&s;idered them as different kinds of &s;ermons; and
they are commonly con&s;idered as different parts of
one &s;ermon. Which of the&s;e two ways of con&s;i|dering
them is mo&s;t proper will appear afterwards,
when we come to con&s;ider Preaching in another
light. At pre&s;ent we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that
though they were to be regarded as different parts
of one &s;ermon, yet as the ends aimed at are dif|ferent,
and as the principles of compo&s;ition &s;uited
to the&s;e ends are likewi&s;e different, it will &s;till be
nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider them &s;eparately; and there|fore
all that has been &s;aid is equally applicable to
Preaching on that &s;uppo&s;ition, as on the &s;uppo|&s;ition
which we have followed.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="5">
<HEAD>ART. V. Of Invention.</HEAD>
<P>We have con&s;idered Preaching with re&s;pect to
the various ends at which it aims, and the kinds of
di&s;cour&s;es which ari&s;e from that variety. This has
led us to remark the mo&s;t general rules belonging
to each &s;pecies of Preaching. The eloquence of
the pulpit may be con&s;idered in another light; with
re&s;pect to the different exertions of mind which it
requires in the &s;peaker. This is a light in which
<PB N="307" REF="314">
writers on the principles of rhetoric have always
cho&s;en to con&s;ider every kind of compo&s;ition;
There have been di&s;putes among them concerning
the number of mental exertions belonging properly
to eloquence, which are too trivial to de&s;erve our
entering into them. They are generally reckoned
five; invention, di&s;po&s;ition, elocution, memory;
and pronunciation; and according to this di&s;tinc|tion,
the parts of eloquence are commonly rec|koned,
By pro&s;ecuting this divi&s;ion, we &s;hall
have an opportunity of laying down the particular
rules of pulpit di&s;cour&s;es, regarding the &s;ubject,
the method, the &s;tyle, and compo&s;ition, the man|dating,
and the delivering. As this is the divi&s;ion
that is commonly followed, in explaining the prin|ciples
of eloquence, by the writers of in&s;titutions, a
number of their rules are applicable to Preaching;
and as you can have recour&s;e to them, we may
treat more &s;hortly of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t exertion of mind nece&s;&s;ary in every
di&s;cour&s;e is invention, which is therefore reckoned
the fir&s;t part of eloquence. Under this head we
&s;hall con&s;ider the helps of invention, the choice of
&s;ubjects, the qualities of texts, the exordium, the
explication of text and context, the laying down
the de&s;ign, the divi&s;ion, the pro&s;ecution, and the
conclu&s;ion. The&s;e parts are common to all kinds
of di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="315">
The helps of invention are of two kinds, mediate
or remote, and immediate. The former are of
very great con&s;equence; they in &s;ome mea&s;ure
remove the need of the latter; but without them,
the latter cannot be &s;ufficient. By the mediate
or remote helps of invention, I mean previous
application, and a fund of knowlege. This is &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary for a public &s;peaker, that all the ancient
writers on rhetoric require almo&s;t univer&s;al know|lege
in an orator. Without a con&s;iderable &s;tock
of &s;olid knowlege, a preacher's head will &s;eem
unfurni&s;hed; he will appear to labour for matter
to fill up his di&s;cour&s;e; he will not &s;eem to &s;peak
from the abundance of his heart, but will talk as
if he were at a lo&s;s for the very next thing he is to
&s;ay. He lives, as it were, from hand to mouth,
without laying up any &s;tock of provi&s;ion; and
therefore, whatever pains he takes about his
di&s;cour&s;es, they appear always thin and half|&s;tarved.
Though he could afford three months
for &s;tudying a &s;ermon, &s;uch particular preparations,
however trouble&s;ome, mu&s;t needs be very imper|fect.
Preachers ought to employ &s;everal years in
laying up a plentiful &s;tock of &s;olid knowlege; and
then, after &s;uch a general preparation, their parti|cular
di&s;cour&s;es will co&s;t them the le&s;s pains. But
if, without any preparatory &s;tudy, a man only
apply to a particular &s;ubject, as he has occa&s;ion to
preach on it, he is forced to put off his hearers
with common-place notions and &s;uperficial remarks.
<PB N="309" REF="316">
If a man be only acquainted with controver&s;y, and
have read &s;ermons, he may thus pick up a few
thoughts; but either they will be merely &s;pecu|lative,
or by being borrowed at &s;econd-hand, they
will be indige&s;ted, dead, and pointle&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;ermon is a di&s;cour&s;e founded on &s;cripture,
and addre&s;&s;ed to men; a preacher mu&s;t therefore
have the&s;e three qualifications, the knowlege of
&s;cripture, of human nature, and of human life.
The&s;e ought to be the three great branches of his
&s;tudy.</P>
<P>The knowlege of &s;cripture mu&s;t be acquired by
reading it much, and that in the original lan|guages;
and by reading it critically, that we may
remember not only the words, the doctrines, the
precepts, the hi&s;tories recorded in holy writ, but
al&s;o thoroughly under&s;tand their meaning, and
their application. The mo&s;t beautiful and &s;triking
parts of the be&s;t &s;ermons are the &s;criptures which
are interwoven with them; and, if they were
always entirely appo&s;ite, and urged with their full
force, they would be almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Sermons &s;hould al&s;o be deeply founded in human
nature. I do not mean that &s;ermons &s;hould be
ab&s;tract di&s;cour&s;es on the principles of human
nature. But when men's feelings are truly deli|neated,
when all maxims and directions that are
given, are perfectly &s;uitable to the principles of
<PB N="310" REF="317">
the mind, then the &s;ermon may be truly &s;aid to be
founded in human nature; and no &s;pecies of ar|gument
will make a deeper impre&s;&s;ion, or produce
a more &s;olid and thorough conviction. In order
to be able to give his di&s;cour&s;es, in this manner,
a foundation in human nature, a preacher mu&s;t
&s;tudy carefully the philo&s;ophy of man, e&s;pecially
of his moral and active powers. A per&s;on who is
unacquainted with this branch of knowlege mu&s;t
be often at a lo&s;s and in danger of mi&s;repre&s;enting
things, when he is to addre&s;s him&s;elf to mankind
on &s;ubjects of practice. This part of philo&s;ophy
mu&s;t not be neglected when the ordinary time
of education in it is expired; it is rather to be
then begun, for it is generally only after this that
men's faculties are ripe for the &s;tudy of it.</P>
<P>The third requi&s;ite mentioned was the knowlege
of human life. Without this, our de&s;criptions
mu&s;t be fal&s;e and unnatural, and can never &s;trike.
It is to be acquired by ob&s;ervation, and by the
&s;tudy of hi&s;tory. Biography is the mo&s;t proper
kind of hi&s;tory for this purpo&s;e. It relates many
minute circum&s;tances, actions, and &s;ayings of a
per&s;on's life, which &s;erve very much to let us into
his real character. It is often proper in &s;ermons,
to adduce profe&s;&s;ed examples, either of the nature,
influence, and deceit of vice, of the nature and
exertions of virtue in real life, or of their con&s;e|quences,
rewards, and puni&s;hments. For mo&s;t
part, the&s;e &s;hould be taken from &s;cripture, and
<PB N="311" REF="318">
more &s;paringly at lea&s;t from prophane hi&s;tory.
But even when a preacher does not choo&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;edly
to make u&s;e of examples, it will be ex|tremely
u&s;eful to have them in his eye, that he
may frame his explication, de&s;cription, or argu|ment,
according to what has really been. The
peru&s;al of hi&s;tory with a view to acquire a know|lege
of real life, will, in a great mea&s;ure, prepare
men for u&s;ing the other method of acquiring this
knowlege; will train them to that acutene&s;s, at|tention,
and thoughtfulne&s;s, which are nece&s;&s;ary
for their making ob&s;ervations them&s;elves on man|kind,
and tracing out characters which they meet
with in real life.</P>
<P>The immediate helps of invention are the works
of other men, from which a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be de|rived.
The&s;e may be reduced to two forts. Fir&s;t,
models which are proper to be imitated. The&s;e
are fini&s;hed and regular di&s;cour&s;es, either on the
&s;ubjects which the preacher is to treat, or on other
&s;ubjects. Tho&s;e which are on different &s;ubjects
are the mo&s;t u&s;eful helps, as they give an impul&s;e
to genius, and a direction to judgement, without
laying him under a temptation merely to tran|&s;cribe.
The ancient orations, particularly tho&s;e
of Demo&s;thenes and Cicero; the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and
elegant &s;ermons, and even &s;ome of the poets, may
be highly u&s;eful for directing genius, and forming
the ta&s;te in Preaching. The &s;econd &s;ort of helps
are &s;uch &s;ermons and compo&s;itions as are rude and
<PB N="312" REF="319">
indige&s;ted as to the manner, but contain plenty of
materials. A preacher cannot copy after the&s;e as
models, but he may dig in them as in a mine.
&lsquo;They are like a piece of rich ore, in which he
may find matter for the furniture of pulpit di&s;|cour&s;es,
and find, at the &s;ame time, &s;uch a
defect of refinement and poli&s;hing, as to leave
room for the exerci&s;e of his own genius and
talents to fini&s;h and rub them up. He may
find a rich collection of noble &s;entiments, and
&s;trong and nervous expre&s;&s;ions, but delivered
with &s;uch negligence of dre&s;s, as to &s;tyle or me|thod,
as leaves abundance of room for the ex|erci&s;e
of his own powers in altering and me|thodi&s;ing
whatever materials he borrows from
them. We may apply to &s;uch productions what
Pope &s;ays of the works of Shak&s;peare; &startq;One
may look upon them, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e
that are more fini&s;hed and regular, as upon an
ancient maje&s;tic piece of Gothic architecture,
compared with a neat modern building: the
latter is more elegant and glaring, but the
former is more &s;trong and more &s;olemn.&endq;</P>
<P>In u&s;ing the immediate helps of invention, a
preacher may take two different ways. He may
fir&s;t read and dige&s;t all that he choo&s;es to con&s;ult
on the &s;ubject, and then, laying a&s;ide the books,
and meditating on his &s;ubject, he may form his
own plan, and di&s;po&s;e the materials which he finds
in his mind, in his own manner and &s;tyle. Or,
<PB N="313" REF="320">
he may fir&s;t form his own plan, and pro&s;ecute it
in the way which he thinks mo&s;t proper, and
then read over writers on the &s;ubject; and after
having read them, review his own compo&s;ition,
and alter or add to it according to the new mate|rials
which he finds &s;ugge&s;ted to him by his read|ing.
The latter method will give a &s;ermon mo&s;t
the appearance of an original, and is, perhaps, for
the mo&s;t part eligible; but the former may be
very properly u&s;ed, either when one is not pre|viou&s;ly
&s;o well acquainted with a particular &s;ubject
on which he is to compo&s;e, or when he is obliged
to compo&s;e in ha&s;te. The&s;e are the only two ways
in which a preacher ought to u&s;e the works of
others. Merely to compile a &s;ermon by tacking
together pa&s;&s;ages which plea&s;e him, from others
who have written on the &s;ubject, is always ab&s;o|lutely
wrong; it gives the whole the appearance
of patchwork; there is no con&s;i&s;tence in the parts,
either as to the train of thought, or as to the &s;tyle.
If one cannot compo&s;e &s;ermons in another way,
it were much better to borrow complete &s;ermons
from the works of others. But certainly, a man
who is under a nece&s;&s;ity of doing either this, or
what is more improper, ought never to have at|tempted
Preaching, or addicted him&s;elf to a pro|fe&s;&s;ion
for which he is &s;o ill qualified.</P>
<P>We proceed next to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on
the choice of &s;ubjects. As to the nature of the
different &s;ubjects which may be properly cho&s;en
<PB N="314" REF="321">
for a di&s;cour&s;e from the pulpit, it will be unne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;ay any thing, after what has been al|ready
&s;aid concerning the kinds of di&s;cour&s;es.
There have been unhappy differences about the
kind of &s;ubjects on which a preacher ought to
in&s;i&s;t. An oppo&s;ition has been e&s;tabli&s;hed between
what is called Go&s;pel-preaching, and what is called
Legal-preaching. I hope this ill-judged and ill-defined
di&s;tinction is now pretty much out of doors,
at lea&s;t with mo&s;t people; and therefore, it will
not be needful to enter &s;o deep into the &s;ubject
as might, perhaps, have been proper when it was
more in vogue. On this, as well as on mo&s;t &s;ub|jects,
it appears to me that men have gone into
extremes. The patrons of what was called Go&s;pel-preaching
in&s;i&s;ted chiefly on the doctrines of reli|gion,
or rather, on &s;ome few of the peculiar doc|trines
of Chri&s;tianity; on the righteou&s;ne&s;s and
&s;acrifice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, on faith in him, on the
great grace of the evangelical di&s;pen&s;ation, and on
the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Divine Spirit. They were
certainly in the right to in&s;i&s;t much on the&s;e; but
they were, notwith&s;tanding, blameable in &s;everal
re&s;pects. They con&s;idered the&s;e doctrines, not in
the genuine &s;train of the New Te&s;tament, which
explains them with the greate&s;t &s;implicity, and
always urges them as arguments for the practice
of holine&s;s; but in the &s;train of di&s;putatious &s;y&s;|tems,
encumbered with technical terms and &s;ubtle
di&s;tinctions, and &s;o as wholly to draw off men's
attention from practice, in&s;tead of contributing to
<PB N="315" REF="322">
excite them to good practice. They omitted many
other parts of the go&s;pel, equally nece&s;&s;ary and
important with the&s;e doctrines; while they en|larged
on the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel and the means
by which they were procured, they were very
&s;paring in recommending the character which we
mu&s;t maintain, and the conduct we mu&s;t pur&s;ue,
if we would be partakers of them, though to ani|mate
us to this is evidently the only end, for which
either the nature of the ble&s;&s;ings them&s;elves, or
the method of their conveyance, was revealed by
God. They indeed often de&s;cribed faith in Chri&s;t;
but they did not enough either de&s;cribe or recom|mend
that love and tho&s;e works which will always
&s;pring from true faith; they rather &s;eemed to de|preciate
them, as if they would have made man|kind
afraid of being holy, left they &s;hould tru&s;t in
it, and rob the Redeemer of his glory in &s;aving
&s;inners; thus directly oppo&s;ing the &s;train in which
both our Saviour and his apo&s;tles &s;poke, who al|ways
urge men to holine&s;s, and &s;et the righteous
in oppo&s;ition to the wicked. In&s;tead of repre|&s;enting
the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Spirit as they are
always repre&s;ented in holy writ, as encourage|ments
and incitements to diligence, they held them
forth in &s;uch a light as tended rather to make men
wait indolently till the Spirit &s;hould operate upon
them, than to exert their utmo&s;t endeavours to
do their duty in a dependence on its aids. When
they either explained or recommended holine&s;s,
they were &s;o careful to repre&s;ent it as ari&s;ing from
<PB N="316" REF="323">
grace, that they &s;carcely either exhorted to it, or
&s;howed the obligations men were under to culti|vate
it. In &s;hort, their &s;ermons were too little cal|culated
to influence practice. On the other hand,
the patrons of what was called Legal-preaching,
repre&s;ented religion as practical, explained and in|culcated
the &s;everal duties of it, urged the argu|ments
which rea&s;on or revelation &s;upplied for the
practice of virtue, in&s;i&s;ted on the great doctrines of
natural religion which the go&s;pel pre-&s;uppo&s;es, as
well as the doctrines of pure revelation which it
&s;uperadds to them. So far they con&s;idered Preach|ing
in its proper light. But they were not wholly
blamele&s;s. They often repre&s;ented the virtues of
the Chri&s;tian life too much in the ab&s;tract manner
of philo&s;ophy, and in the terms of art of modern
&s;chola&s;tici&s;m. They in&s;i&s;ted, perhaps, too &s;eldom
on the peculiar doctrines of revelation, and on the
duties which re&s;ult from the new relations of which
it informs us. In oppo&s;ition to both extremes, a
Chri&s;tian preacher ought to in&s;i&s;t both on the doc|trines
and on the duties of religion; always repre|&s;enting
the former as arguments for the latter,
and the practice of the latter as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
to render our knowlege of the former really u&s;eful
to us; and always expre&s;&s;ing the whole, as much
as po&s;&s;ible, in the &s;train of &s;cripture language.
This is undoubtedly Go&s;pel-preaching; for it is to
preach in the &s;ame way that Chri&s;t preached, and
that his apo&s;tles wrote.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="324">
What farther remains with regard to the choice
of &s;ubjects is, the qualities of any particular &s;ubject
which is cho&s;en. The only quality that it will be
nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of is, that in every &s;ermon
there &s;hould be unity of de&s;ign. This is a funda|mental
rule in every &s;ort of compo&s;ition; but in
none is it more frequently neglected than in
&s;ermons. It is indeed &s;o univer&s;ally di&s;regarded,
that it may perhaps appear to many a &s;ingularity
and affectation either to recommend it or to adhere
to it in Preaching. But, however little it has been
followed in practice, it has been recommended by
&s;ome who have written on Preaching, particularly
by Bi&s;hop Burnet and the Archbi&s;hop of Cambray.
It is indeed a rule founded in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential prin|ciples
of human nature. Man, being a rea&s;onable
being, thinks and &s;peaks with &s;ome intention and
de&s;ign. He has always &s;ome end in view, however
wrong and trifling the end it&s;elf, or however im|proper
the means by which he endeavours the
attainment of the end, may often be. It is there|fore
requi&s;ite that in all compo&s;itions the writer
have &s;ome plan or object. A production without
a de&s;ign would re&s;emble more the ravings of a
madman, than the regular effects of thought and
genius. Now, if there mu&s;t be a de&s;ign or plan,
there ought likewi&s;e to be unity of de&s;ign. When
this is wanting, there is no bond of connection
between the different &s;ubjects treated of, which
may bring them under one plan or view, and
which may ea&s;ily convey the mind from one of
<PB N="318" REF="325">
them to the other. The under&s;tanding finds it
difficult, when it has been filled with the concep|tion
of one object, to make a tran&s;ition to another
wholly different, and cannot ea&s;ily conceive that
other in a &s;trong and lively manner. Even the
under&s;tanding is perplexed and confounded and
di&s;tracted; but if the nature of the &s;ubject be
&s;uch as tends to excite the pa&s;&s;ions, the inconve|nience
is &s;till greater. When the pa&s;&s;ions are
excited by one object, they will pa&s;s ea&s;ily to
another connected with it; but they will pa&s;s with
difficulty or not at all along different objects quite
unconnected with one another. By this means a
preacher, by introducing different &s;ubjects and
different de&s;igns into one &s;ermon, would lo&s;e all
that communication of emotions by which alone he
can intere&s;t the heart, and rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions to a
proper pitch.</P>
<P>If unity of de&s;ign be nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;ermon, it
will be proper to con&s;ider how it may be pre&s;erved,
what is to be deemed a deviation from it, and
what degree of variety is con&s;i&s;tent with it. We
have already reckoned up &s;everal kinds of di&s;|cour&s;es.
It was with a view to the propriety of
unity of de&s;ign, that we called them di&s;tinct
kinds; for mo&s;t commonly they are all united in
the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e, and all &s;eem to be equally
principal, and their ends equally ultimate in the
intention of the preacher. Now, by explaining
how far the&s;e kinds may allowably be combined,
<PB N="319" REF="326">
and how far not, all will be done that is nece&s;&s;ary
on this &s;ubject of unity of de&s;ign. There is one
ca&s;e, in which all or mo&s;t of the kinds of di&s;cour&s;es
that have been mentioned, may be joined together
even profe&s;&s;edly in di&s;cour&s;ing from one text. It
is when that text is made the &s;ubject of &s;everal
di&s;cour&s;es, and every &s;eparate di&s;cour&s;e is the pro|&s;ecution
of one of the de&s;igns propo&s;ed. For
in&s;tance, if 2 Corinth, v. 14. be cho&s;en for a text,
&startq;The love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us, becau&s;e we
thus judge, that if one died for all, then were
all dead.&endq; To pro&s;ecute all the de&s;igns which
are implied in this ver&s;e, one might propo&s;e &s;uch
a method as this: 1. To &s;how that, previous to
the interpo&s;ition of Chri&s;t, all men were in a &s;tate
of death. 2. To &s;how that Chri&s;t died, that he
might redeem us from this &s;tate of death. 3. To
&s;how that this interpo&s;ition of Chri&s;t was a di&s;play
of the greate&s;t love. 4. To urge the death of
Chri&s;t for us, and the love which it manife&s;ted, as
an argument for Chri&s;tian obedience. If we con|&s;ider
this as a method propo&s;ed for one di&s;cour&s;e, it
will have too little unity of de&s;ign. But if the&s;e
four heads be made the &s;ubject of four di&s;cour&s;es,
each di&s;cour&s;e will be properly one; the three
former of the probatory, the la&s;t of the &s;ua&s;ory
kind. Each will be as really di&s;tinct from the
other, as if it had been preached from a di&s;tinct
text; and each will have its own unity of de&s;ign:
the preacher only &s;aves him&s;elf the trouble of
finding out a new text for every &s;ermon. Some|times
<PB N="320" REF="327">
it may be eligible to u&s;e this method;
thus, if one choo&s;e a text which is a general
exhortation to any duty, as Ephe&s;. v. 2. &startq;walk
in love,&endq; he may with equal propriety propo&s;e,
in any &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e, either to explain the nature
of Chri&s;tian love or charity, or to enforce the
practice of it. If therefore he think it proper to
in&s;i&s;t on both the&s;e &s;ubjects, he may certainly
pro&s;ecute the former in one di&s;cour&s;e, and the
latter in another di&s;cour&s;e from the &s;ame text,
without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing any of the rules of compo|&s;ition.
Sometimes again it will be more eligible
to choo&s;e different texts for the different points
which one de&s;igns to pro&s;ecute; as when &s;ome of
them are but ob&s;curely implied in a text which
treats of the others; when the &s;ubjects which
might be found implied in one text are very dif|ferent
and unconnected; when pro&s;ecuting them
all in &s;o many different di&s;cour&s;es would occa&s;ion
one's in&s;i&s;ting too long on one text, &s;o that it
might become tedious and di&s;agreeable to the
hearers, and wear off that expectation of novelty
which a new text is apt to rai&s;e. But which of
the&s;e methods he will choo&s;e mu&s;t be left to the
judgement of the preacher on particular occa&s;ions.
Only it mu&s;t be remembered that the &s;ubject of
each &s;eparate di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be &s;trictly one.</P>
<P>In order to this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that in every
di&s;cour&s;e &s;ome one of the ends of Preaching above
taken notice of &s;hould be the leading and principal
<PB N="321" REF="328">
de&s;ign of the preacher, and that every thing intro|duced
into the &s;ermon &s;hould be rendered &s;ub|ordinate
to that end. To propo&s;e explication,
proof, per&s;ua&s;ion, as different ends all equally
principal in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e, is plainly to deviate
from unity. One of them diverts the attention
from the other, and tends to di&s;tract the mind.
But though, to pre&s;erve unity, it be ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome one of the ends of Preaching
be the leading de&s;ign in a &s;ermon, yet others of
the ends may be aimed at as &s;ubordinate to that
end which is predominate. For in&s;tance, if the
de&s;ign of a di&s;cour&s;e be to explain any duty, what,
if it were alone, would form a demon&s;trative or
panegyrical di&s;cour&s;e, may very properly be intro|duced
as a means of explication. An illu&s;trious
example of that virtue exerci&s;ed by a per&s;on in
real life, will &s;how the proper exertions of that
virtue more plainly than any ab&s;tract precepts that
could be given; and, while it thus does not inter|fere
with the end, explication, but promotes it, it
will very effectually, though without an appear|ance
of de&s;igning it, &s;trike the con&s;cience with a
&s;en&s;e of its obligation, and di&s;po&s;e men to practi&s;e
what they are made to &s;ee belongs to their duty.
Thus, in an explicatory di&s;cour&s;e, the demon|&s;trative
may be incorporated, &s;o as to contribute to
the main end of the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, in a probatory di&s;cour&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;arily
&s;uppo&s;ed that the doctrine to be proved is previou&s;ly
<PB N="322" REF="329">
under&s;tood. It would be a deviation from unity to
propo&s;e fir&s;t the explication, and then the proof of
the doctrine, as two independent heads. But
though explication be not directly propo&s;ed, yet
the whole proof may be, and ought to be, con|ducted
in &s;uch a way, as may of cour&s;e carry
explication along with it, and really make the
doctrine under&s;tood, while it propo&s;es only to
confirm it. Indeed, the eviction of a doctrine
includes explication &s;o naturally, that an argu|ment
cannot be ju&s;tly pro&s;ecuted, without its
&s;howing, in every &s;tep of it, what is the nature of
the truth which it is brought to prove. In a pro|batory
di&s;cour&s;e, indeed in any di&s;cour&s;e, it would
be wrong to make a digre&s;&s;ion to explain a difficult
text of &s;cripture which is brought in incidentally;
but yet &s;ome explication of &s;cripture, viz. &s;o far as
it is &s;ub&s;ervient to illu&s;tration or proof, may be
very properly introduced in any di&s;cour&s;e. In a
&s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e, per&s;ua&s;ion ought to be the only
profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the whole; every thing that is
introduced &s;hould be regarded but as a mean of
promoting this end. But explication, proof, and
painting, are, from the very nature of this di&s;cour&s;e,
nece&s;&s;arily introduced, not for their own &s;akes, or
as a part of the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the preacher,
but as means of per&s;ua&s;ion. Examples are very
proper motives to practice, and therefore may be
here di&s;played in all their beauty, and directly
urged as motives to good practice. In a word, all
that is nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving unity of de&s;ign in a
<PB N="323" REF="330">
&s;ermon is, that one &s;imple de&s;ign be propo&s;ed;
that every thing introduced be &s;uch as tends to
promote that de&s;ign, and be &s;et in the par|ticular
light in which it will tend mo&s;t to pro|mote
it.</P>
<P>It will appear, from what has been &s;aid, that the
ordinary way of dividing &s;ermons into &s;o many
di&s;tinct and independent heads, is &s;carcely con&s;i&s;tent
with unity of de&s;ign. But it mu&s;t be remarked,
that every divi&s;ion is by no means incon&s;i&s;tent with
it. A di&s;cour&s;e is naturally divided into parts,
according to the branches of the &s;ubject to be
explained, or the arguments which are urged.
But even a divi&s;ion, very little different from &s;uch
as are commonly propo&s;ed, and pro&s;ecuted in a
manner very little different, may be ea&s;ily contrived
&s;o as to be rendered con&s;i&s;tent with unity of de&s;ign.
We may illu&s;trate this by &s;ome examples. We
already mentioned a method which might be pro|po&s;ed,
and would very probably be propo&s;ed in
the ordinary way of preaching, on 2 Corinth, v. 14.
and which is incon&s;i&s;tent with unity of de&s;ign.
Yet if, in preaching on that text, it were propo&s;ed
as the de&s;ign of the &s;ermon, to urge men to live
to Chri&s;t by the practice of holine&s;s, from the con|&s;ideration
of his death, all the very &s;ame heads
which we mentioned before might be introduced
very con&s;i&s;tently with unity of de&s;ign, with no
other variation but that of propo&s;ing and pro&s;e|cuting
<PB N="324" REF="331">
them as motives or arguments to this con|duct.
One might propo&s;e to pur&s;ue the de&s;ign, by
&s;howing that the death of Chri&s;t urges us to holine&s;s
and the obedience of his go&s;pel, by evincing,
1. That without being thus intere&s;ted in his death,
we mu&s;t be in a &s;tate of death and mi&s;ery: 2. That
we are bound to it, becau&s;e it was the very de&s;ign
of Chri&s;t's death to deliver us from the bondage of
&s;in: 3. That we are bound by his death to obey
him, in gratitude for the love which his &s;ubmitting
to death for us manife&s;ted. Thus again, in preach|ing
from Matth. v. 8. &startq;Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in
heart, for they &s;hall &s;ee God,&endq; the common
method is, 1. to explain purity of heart; 2. to
explain the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;eeing God; 3. to &s;how
the connection between them. Here, three differ|ent
heads, though not unconnected, yet &s;eparate
and independent, are propo&s;ed as equally principal.
But if one would pre&s;erve unity of de&s;ign on this
&s;ubject, it would be proper to propo&s;e, as the
de&s;ign of the di&s;cour&s;e, to enforce the practice of
holine&s;s from the happine&s;s in the enjoyment of
God which is connected with it; and in pro&s;e|cuting
this &s;imple de&s;ign, all that is nece&s;&s;ary for
explaining either the nature of holine&s;s or of its
reward might be introduced &s;o as to be rendered
&s;ub&s;ervient to it. It is needle&s;s to multiply ex|amples.
If men be once &s;en&s;ible that an adherence
to unity is proper, it will be ea&s;y to di&s;cour&s;e on
every &s;ubject &s;o as to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="332">
I would not be under&s;tood to mean that an ad|herence
to unity of de&s;ign is &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary
in every &s;ermon, that it &s;hould never be
departed from in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. But certainly
it is a rule of compo&s;ition &s;o plainly founded in
human nature, that it ought not to be departed
from often, or without any rea&s;on at all. A &s;trict
adherence to it will indeed render Preaching more
difficult. It is not &s;o ea&s;y to keep one de&s;ign con|tinually
in view, and promote it through a whole
di&s;cour&s;e, as, without forming any de&s;ign, to &s;peak
a little upon different views of a &s;ubject. But a
Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter ought to follow, not the method
of Preaching which is ea&s;ie&s;t, but what is mo&s;t
proper and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering Preaching with re&s;pect to the
different exertions of mind employed in it, which
are commonly called the parts of eloquence, we
naturally began with invention, and have already
con&s;idered the helps of invention, and the quali|ties
of the &s;ubject in general. We &s;hall now con|&s;ider
invention, as it regards the &s;everal parts of a
pulpit di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the text. It is a part of
&s;cripture which contains the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e,
and by its being divinely in&s;pired, gives weight
and authority to it. We already made all the ob|&s;ervations
that are nece&s;&s;ary, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e
pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which are the texts of &s;uch
<PB N="326" REF="333">
di&s;cour&s;es as we termed Lectures. The ob&s;ervations
which we are now to make, regard the di&s;cour&s;es
which are properly termed Sermons. From the
nature and de&s;ign of a text, it will follow that the
principal qualities which &s;hould be &s;ought for in
it, are &s;uch, as the&s;e. 1. It &s;hould be a propo|&s;ition
containing the intention and &s;ub&s;tance of the
&s;ermon, &s;o that the text may be the &s;ermon in
epitome, and the &s;ermon the text &s;pread out and
expanded. It is a fault to prefix a text as if it
were only a motto to a di&s;cour&s;e which has &s;ome
relation to it, but does not pro&s;ecute its real in|tention
and de&s;ign. It deprives the di&s;cour&s;e of
the weight and authority which might ari&s;e from
its being evidently founded on the text. If the
&s;ubject of the &s;ermon be &s;uch that a text directly
expre&s;&s;ing it cannot be found in &s;cripture, it gives
a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that that is not a proper
&s;ubject of Preaching; and if a text directly imply|ing
it can be found, it &s;hows want of judgement
in a preacher to choo&s;e one that does not. It will
not be difficult to find texts which have this quality
for any &s;ubject of true religion. A general a&s;|&s;ertion
of a doctrine will &s;erve either for a &s;ermon
intended to explain that doctrine, or for one in|tended
to prove it. For a &s;ermon de&s;igned to ex|plain
a duty, one may choo&s;e either a general ex|hortation
to that duty, or a place of &s;cripture
which enumerates the parts of the duty. In order
to per&s;uade to a duty, one may choo&s;e a text
which either contains a general exhortation to it,
<PB N="327" REF="334">
or expre&s;&s;es its obligation, its nece&s;&s;ity, or advan|tages.
2. A text &s;hould be &s;imple; it &s;hould not
only contain the whole &s;ubject, but likewi&s;e it
&s;hould contain nothing be&s;ides it. Without this,
either there will be &s;ome part of it which has no|thing
to an&s;wer to it in the &s;ermon; or the &s;ermon
mu&s;t contain two or more &s;ubjects in&s;tead of one.
At lea&s;t, if the text be complex, one part of it
&s;hould be made the &s;ubject of each &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e.
3. A text &s;hould be plain, that it may not require
long time and great pains for clearing up the mean|ing
of it, or making it under&s;tood, and thus detain
too long from the pro&s;ecution of the &s;ubject which
it contains. 4. A text is the better if it be &s;hort,
for it will be the more ea&s;ily remembered. All
the qualities oppo&s;ite to the&s;e are faults in a text,
though not all equally unpardonable. It may not
be always, ea&s;y to find a text at once &s;imple, plain,
and &s;hort, for every &s;ubject which a preacher may
think it u&s;eful to in&s;i&s;t upon. And certainly he
ought not to lay a&s;ide an u&s;eful &s;ubject merely be|cau&s;e
he cannot find a text in all re&s;pects &s;uch as
he would choo&s;e. It is one of the mo&s;t unpardon|able
faults in a text, not to imply truly the &s;ubject
of the di&s;cour&s;e. If it only re&s;emble it in &s;ound,
it is a mere playing upon words; it is in no proper
&s;en&s;e a foundation for the di&s;cour&s;e. All texts
that, in relation to the &s;ubject, have any appear|ance
of wit, or humour, or conceit, are very im|proper,
for they are un&s;uitable to the dignity and
gravity of the pulpit. It has been di&s;puted, whe|ther
<PB N="328" REF="335">
a text &s;hould be cho&s;en for the &s;ubject, or
the &s;ubject cho&s;en and the di&s;cour&s;e made for the
text. In all di&s;cour&s;es formed in the textual me|thod,
in all which we have comprehended under
the name of Lectures, the latter mu&s;t be the ca&s;e.
And the opinion of tho&s;e who have determined
that this latter &s;hould always be the ca&s;e, &s;eems to
have ari&s;en from their admitting only the textual
method of Preaching. But in the &s;everal other
kinds of &s;ermons of which we have taken notice,
there &s;eems to be no impropriety in choo&s;ing a
text for the &s;ubject. And any text expre&s;&s;ing the
&s;ubject will obviou&s;ly appear to &s;uit a di&s;cour&s;e
properly made on that &s;ubject. But a &s;ubject may
often be di&s;torted or prevented from being repre|&s;ented
in the mo&s;t natural and &s;triking manner, by
being &s;tudiou&s;ly adapted to the phra&s;es and manner
of expre&s;&s;ion of a particular text. It is, perhaps,
the be&s;t way in general to choo&s;e the &s;ubject and
form the de&s;ign of the di&s;cour&s;e fir&s;t of all, then to
fix on a text which expre&s;&s;es it, and with that text
in view to compo&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The exordium naturally &s;ucceeds the text. Its
end is to prepare the minds of the hearers for the
di&s;cour&s;e. It is &s;ometimes not nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e an
exordium, becau&s;e their minds need no prepara|tion;
as when we are to di&s;cour&s;e on a &s;ubject
that is ea&s;y and generally acceptable, and again&s;t
which they entertain no prejudices. If one choo&s;e
an exordium here, it may be employed in repre|&s;enting
<PB N="329" REF="336">
the &s;ubject as generally acknowleged to be
u&s;eful, and as, therefore, confe&s;&s;edly important
and worthy of regard, though too little regarded
in practice. Sometimes again, a preacher combats
the prejudices of men, as when he defends a doc|trine
which they are di&s;po&s;ed to reject, or incul|cates
a duty which is perhaps unfa&s;hionable. In
this ca&s;e an exordium &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary, or,
at lea&s;t, highly u&s;eful, and it &s;hould, with as much
addre&s;s. as po&s;&s;ible, expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of the
prejudices again&s;t the &s;ubject, or in&s;inuate the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of combating them, or give &s;uch an account
of their origin as may di&s;po&s;e men to &s;u&s;pect them,
or hint that it is the preacher's &s;en&s;e of their dan|gerous
tendency that leads him to endeavour to
remove them. The importance of the &s;ubject, and
the near concern which the hearers have in it, is
often a very proper topic for an exordium; but it
&s;hould not &s;pend it&s;elf in mere general a&s;&s;ertions
to this purpo&s;e, but &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch &s;entiments as may
convince the hearers. This will have a great ten|dency
to engage them to attention, and to di&s;po&s;e
them to give the di&s;cour&s;e a favourable hearing.
The exordium may &s;ometimes be employed in lay|ing
open &s;uch principles as tend to make the &s;ub|ject
better under&s;tood, and thus both di&s;po&s;e the
hearers for attending to it, and prepare them for
profiting by it. Sometimes, a piece of hi&s;tory,
e&s;pecially of &s;acred hi&s;tory, may be very properly
turned into an exordium; particularly when the
text is introduced by a hi&s;tory; in this ca&s;e, the
<PB N="330" REF="337">
exordium will coincide with the giving a view of
the context. But it would be tedious to mention
all the topics from which introductions may be de|duced,
or to illu&s;trate them by examples. From
whatever topics the exordium be deduced, it
&s;hould be fit for an&s;wering its end, for preparing
the minds of the hearers. In order to prepare
their minds for profiting by the di&s;cour&s;e, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to render them <HI>attentive,</HI> for without
this they cannot either under&s;tand or apply it; to
render them <HI>docile,</HI> or fit to apprehend and receive
it; and <HI>benevolent,</HI> ready to give a fair hearing to
the preacher. The&s;e di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould be kept
up through the whole di&s;cour&s;e, but it is the bu|&s;ine&s;s
of the exordium or introduction to rai&s;e
them. All the topics already mentioned, and all
the topics proper for introductions, mu&s;t be &s;ub|&s;ervient
to &s;ome of the&s;e purpo&s;es of the intro|duction.
An introduction is faulty if it be com|mon,
or &s;uch as may be applied with equal pro|priety
to almo&s;t any &s;ubject. It ought to ri&s;e
naturally from the &s;ubject, and to lead directly to
the next part of the di&s;cour&s;e; it &s;hould appear to
be taken, as it were, from the very bowels of the
&s;ubject, and be fit to give an opening to it; on
this account, it has been the opinion of &s;ome rhe|torical
writers, that, though it comes fir&s;t in
order, it ought generally to be thought of la&s;t,
after the whole de&s;ign is thoroughly dige&s;ted; but
I imagine that, in this way, there would be great
danger of its being forced, and not cohering &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="331" REF="338">
with the &s;ermon. The introduction &s;hould
generally be cool, for it is natural to begin calmly,
and to ri&s;e to warmth by degrees, in proportion
as one is more engaged by his &s;ubject. But when
the &s;ubject is obviou&s;ly intere&s;ting, and when the
text gives an affecting view of it, a warm and ve|hement
exordium is allowable, and will have a
great influence on the audience. That an intro|duction
may be fit to produce the effects for which
it is de&s;igned, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the introduction
it&s;elf both be under&s;tood, and plea&s;e. In order to
the&s;e, it mu&s;t be plain, the &s;entences &s;hort, every
thing accurate, the expre&s;&s;ions proper, but with|out
an appearance of labour and &s;tudy, yet &s;mooth
and flowing; it &s;hould be fit to catch and entice
the hearers all at once. Finally, an introduction
&s;hould be &s;hort; immoderate length is a great
fault; it makes it di&s;proportioned to the di&s;cour&s;e;
it keeps the main de&s;ign too long out of view.</P>
<P>The introduction is &s;ucceeded by the explication
of the text and context. The de&s;ign of explaining
the text is to make it under&s;tood, and to &s;how that
it really contains that which is the &s;ubject of the
di&s;cour&s;e. By &s;howing this before-hand, the
preacher is freed from the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;torting
his &s;ubject during the pro&s;ecution of it, to accom|modate
it to the preci&s;e words and form of ex|pre&s;&s;ion
in that particular text. Whenever, there|fore,
the text is perfectly plain of it&s;elf, and ob|viou&s;ly
contains the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e, it is
<PB N="332" REF="339">
&s;uperfluous to &s;pend time in explaining it. The
only de&s;ign of explaining the context is to &s;how,
from the intention of the writer and the connection
of the text with what $goes before, that the mean|ing
which the preacher puts upon it is its real and
genuine &s;en&s;e, and that he, therefore, pur&s;ues in
his di&s;cour&s;e what is its true import. On this ac|count
it is evident that when a context is plain,
no explication of it is nece&s;&s;ary for inve&s;tigating
the true meaning of the text; and when there is
no dependence of the text on what precedes, any
notice of the context is &s;uperfluous. When an
explication of the text, or the context, or of both,
is nece&s;&s;ary, the rules of it may be deduced from
what has been already &s;aid of lectures. We &s;hall
only ob&s;erve that the explication &s;hould be as &s;hort
as po&s;&s;ible; for it is rather a preparation to the
de&s;ign, than a direct part of it.</P>
<P>The next part is the de&s;ign. It &s;hould coincide
with the import of the text, and &s;hould be pro|po&s;ed
in a &s;ingle propo&s;ition. By this means it
will appear clearly what is the point at which the
preacher is to drive; and the hearers will be pre|pared
for perceiving the &s;ub&s;ervience of every
thing that he &s;ays, to this point. It &s;hould be
propo&s;ed in as plain terms, and &s;et in as &s;triking
a light as po&s;&s;ible. It will thus make the deeper
impre&s;&s;ion on the hearers, and throw greater light
on the whole di&s;cour&s;e. An affectation of quaint|ne&s;s
and ingenuity in propo&s;ing the de&s;ign is al|ways
<PB N="333" REF="340">
blameable, as it detracts from its &s;olidity
and weight, and renders it le&s;s apt to be under|&s;tood
or remembered.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid of the kinds of di&s;|cour&s;es,
it will be ea&s;y to conceive how the de&s;ign
&s;hould be propo&s;ed; it will be to explain, to
prove, or to per&s;uade. It is &s;ometimes very pro|per
to join with the propo&s;ition of the de&s;ign, an
in&s;inuation of the u&s;eful purpo&s;e which it an&s;wers;
for example, when one propo&s;es to explain any
duty, he might add, that all may &s;ee what it is that
is incumbent on them, and may be enabled, on
examining them&s;elves, to di&s;cern how far they
comply with their duty, and in what re&s;pects they
are negligent or defective in it. Or it may be
proper to join with it a direction to &s;uch a di&s;po|&s;ition
in hearing, as may enable them to apply the
di&s;cour&s;e to its proper u&s;e, as to reflect on their own
conduct, and examine their own con&s;ciences, while
a duty is explained; to ponder the force of every
argument produced, when a truth is confirmed;
and &s;o in other ca&s;es. It is very common with the
French preachers to &s;ubjoin an Ave Maria to the
propo&s;ing of their de&s;ign. A Prote&s;tant preacher
may &s;ub&s;titute, in place of this, a &s;hort prayer.
If this were always u&s;ed, it would degenerate into
a mere unaffecting form. But &s;ometimes, when
the &s;ubject is uncommonly &s;trinking or &s;olemn, or
when one has been rai&s;ed to a con&s;iderable degree
of warmth in the exordium, or when it has ended
<PB N="334" REF="341">
with any mention of the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the divine
&s;pirit, a &s;hort prayer for God's rendering the
de&s;ign effectual may be very properly &s;ubjoined to
the propo&s;al of it, and will have great influence.
Sometimes the propo&s;ition of the de&s;ign may be very
properly implied in a prayer or invocation of this
kind. But the varieties which may be admitted,
and the occa&s;ions that are proper for them, will
be naturally &s;ugge&s;ted to a preacher by his &s;ubject,
and the circum&s;tances in which he is to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion or method comes next in order.
It is the propo&s;ing of the &s;everal parts or members
of the &s;ubject, before entering on the pro&s;ecution of
them. Divi&s;ions were never u&s;ed by the ancient
orators, and very &s;eldom by the chri&s;tian fathers.
They were fir&s;t introduced by the &s;chola&s;tics, and
have been &s;ince almo&s;t univer&s;ally retained by
chri&s;tian preachers. The ancient orators, in&s;tead
of propo&s;ing before-hand the divi&s;ion which they
were to follow, often even &s;tudied to conceal the
di&s;tinction of the parts during the pro&s;ecution.
Indeed, as their view in &s;peaking was to per&s;uade
their hearers to &s;omething which was to be done
immediately, a formal divi&s;ion might have had &s;o
much the appearance of &s;tudy, as to have pre|vented
this effect. And as the effect mu&s;t take
place immediately, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to do any
thing which might a&s;&s;i&s;t them in retaining after|wards
a di&s;tinct view of the tenor of the di&s;cour&s;e.
But a Chri&s;tian Preacher is to deliver di&s;cour&s;es on
<PB N="335" REF="342">
important &s;ubjects, which, it is taken for granted,
he has carefully con&s;idered before-hand, and there|fore
an appearance of &s;tudy will not &s;o directly
ob&s;truct any de&s;ign which he may propo&s;e. His
di&s;cour&s;e is intended to influence them in a long
cour&s;e of conduct; and in order to influence them,
it mu&s;t be remembered and recollected long after
it is heard; in order to which it is nece&s;&s;ary that
it be di&s;tinctly apprehended when it is heard: the
propo&s;ing a divi&s;ion contributes to this end, and is
therefore no ways improper. In a word, a divi&s;ion
is more nece&s;&s;ary to preachers than it was to the
ancient orato$$, on account of the different natures
and de&s;igns of their di&s;cour&s;es; what were incon|veniences
to them will be none to preachers.
There are doubtle&s;s &s;ome ca&s;es, in which a divi|&s;ion
will be inconvenient in a &s;ermon. For in|&s;tance,
it may &s;ometimes happen that all the parts
of a &s;ermon ri&s;e naturally out of one another, and
contribute directly to one de&s;ign; yet if they were
all propo&s;ed in the beginning, their connection
and dependence would not appear: in this ca&s;e, it
is better to omit any pro&s;e&s;&s;ed divi&s;ion, and to
content one&s;elf with propo&s;ing the general de&s;ign.
&startq;When a divi&s;ion is given, it &s;hould be &s;uch as
ari&s;es naturally from the &s;ubject; &s;uch as gives
a light and a ju&s;t order to the &s;everal parts;
&s;uch a divi&s;ion as may be ea&s;ily remembered,
and, at the &s;ame time, help to connect and
retain the whole; &s;uch a divi&s;ion as &s;hows at
once the extent of the &s;ubject and of all its
<PB N="336" REF="343">
&startq;parts.&endq; Thus the divi&s;ion of an explicatory
&s;ermon will be according to the different branches
of the doctrine or duty to be explained; that of a
probatory or &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e, according to the
different arguments which are to be urged, for
conviction or per&s;ua&s;ion. A divi&s;ion &s;hould not
con&s;i&s;t of too many members; if it does, mo&s;t
&s;ubjects will be, by this means, cut into pieces
rather than properly di&s;tributed into parts; be&s;ides,
it will confound both the apprehen&s;ions and the
memories of the hearers, and will thus produce
the very inconvenience which it is the only de&s;ign
of it to prevent. This fault in divi&s;ion generally
proceeds from an affectation of &s;ubtlety in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
wherever there is the minute&s;t difference,
&s;ometimes where there is no difference at all. The
French preachers generally confine them&s;elves to
three parts; but &s;ome &s;ubjects have more than
three di&s;tinct members; and, con&s;idering the
variety of &s;ubjects, no certain number can be
fixed on for every ca&s;e. A divi&s;ion &s;hould be laid
down as &s;hortly, and in as plain terms, as po&s;&s;ible,
without either ob&s;cure or &s;uperfluous expre&s;&s;ions.
There &s;hould be no affectation of quaintne&s;s or
conceit in a divi&s;ion. This is a &s;ault very frequent
in the French preachers. Where there is any
degree of this, it renders the divi&s;ion wor&s;e than
it would be in the textual way of deducing the
divi&s;ion, not from the members of the &s;ubject,
but from the expre&s;&s;ions and clau&s;es of the text.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="344">
We come now to con&s;ider invention, as em|ployed
about the pro&s;ecution or body of the di&s;|cour&s;e.
This is in every di&s;cour&s;e the principal part.
The way in which the ancient rhetoricians treated
of this part, was by pointing out the &s;everal &s;orts
of topics, or common places, from which arguments
or illu&s;trations might be deduced. The&s;e they
handled with great &s;ubtlety. It is however found
by experience, that the&s;e are of little u&s;e in practice.
They &s;upply only &s;uperficial arguments at the be&s;t;
they only give a hint to genius, and &s;ometimes they
rather mi&s;lead than direct into the right way. They
may be an ingenious analy&s;is of the heads of argu|ment;
but they are of no u&s;e as a foundation for
&s;peaking. We &s;hall not therefore &s;pend time in
accommodating them to &s;ermons. A thorough
under&s;tanding of the &s;ubject will be a much better
means of inventing what is proper to be &s;aid on it,
than any artificial topics. We have already pre|vented
our&s;elves in what might have been ob&s;erved
concerning the peculiarities of pro&s;ecution, accord|ing
to the different kinds of di&s;cour&s;es. All therefore
that remains is to con&s;ider what is common to
all the kinds.</P>
<P>The object of invention is the &s;entiment: it will
not therefore be improper to point out the &s;everal
qualities of &s;entiments or thoughts which a
chri&s;tian preacher ought to &s;eek after, and of the
faults which he ought to avoid. The fir&s;t and
fundamental quality of thoughts or &s;entiments on
<PB N="338" REF="345">
every &s;ubject is, that they be true and ju&s;t. Fre|quently
tho&s;e thoughts or &s;entiments which appear
at fir&s;t &s;ight the brighte&s;t, are not ju&s;t and &s;olid;
yet they are apt to dazzle and plea&s;e by their
glare, and on that account to be cho&s;en. Such
fal&s;e thoughts would not, however, pa&s;s without
cen&s;ure by a judicious critic, in a piece of wit, or a
poem. But they are, above all, un&s;uitable to the
gravity and &s;olemnity of pulpit di&s;cour&s;es, and
to the importance of the &s;ubjects treated in them.
Truth is the fir&s;t quality, the very &s;ub&s;tance of
&s;entiment: if it want truth, the more bold and
&s;hining it is, the more faulty it mu&s;t be. Thoughts
are the images of things, and are true no farther
than they repre&s;ent things faithfully. Again,
thoughts or &s;entiments ought to be natural. Na|tural
thoughts are not far-fetched, but ari&s;e obvi|ou&s;ly
from the &s;ubject; &s;o that they &s;eem to have
been found ea&s;ily and without any labour; and
one would think that they mu&s;t have occurred to
any per&s;on on the &s;ubject. The oppo&s;ite of this
quality is affectation; when &s;entiments are &s;tu|diou&s;ly
&s;tretched and carried too far; when,
in&s;tead of being &s;ublime, they are extravagant;
when, in&s;tead of being elegant, they are finical;
when, in&s;tead of being delicate, they are &s;ubtle
and refined. On the contrary, when thoughts are
natural, they bear no mark of &s;tudy or de&s;ign; if
an object be de&s;cribed, it is by &s;uch appearances of
it as &s;trike every per&s;on as &s;oon as they are men|tioned;
the pa&s;&s;ions are made to expre&s;s them|&s;elves
<PB N="339" REF="346">
properly in their own language. But
in avoiding affected &s;entiments, we mu&s;t take
care not to fall into &s;uch as are flat and languid.</P>
<P>Another quality of &s;entiment a-kin to the former
is, that it be &s;uitable to the &s;ubject. Tho&s;e &s;enti|ments
which &s;uit a familiar &s;ubject, will not &s;uit
a &s;ublime or pathetic one; tho&s;e which &s;uit expli|cation
would be cold in per&s;ua&s;ion; tho&s;e which
would be proper to per&s;ua&s;ion would be extrava|gant
in explication. It is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary that
&s;entiments be per&s;picuous or clear. Ob&s;curity
&s;ometimes belongs to the &s;entiment as well as to
the expre&s;&s;ion. When it ri&s;es to a great height, it
becomes unintelligible and ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e. Even
when it is in a le&s;s degree, when a thought is &s;o
ab&s;tru&s;e as to become dark and hard to be under|&s;tood,
it is a fault. A thought ought to be &s;o
clear, that per&s;ons of tolerable under&s;tanding may
comprehend it, without being obliged to employ
too great application of mind. The&s;e qualities of
&s;entiment are univer&s;ally and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary.
There are others which are not nece&s;&s;ary in
every ca&s;e, but ought to be attended to in ca&s;es
where they are proper; &s;uch as &s;ublimity, beauty,
delicacy, which are &s;o fully explained by critical
writers that it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on
them.</P>
<P>The la&s;t part of a di&s;cour&s;e is the conclu&s;ion or
peroration, which pretty much coincides with what
<PB N="340" REF="347">
is commonly called the application. The conclu|&s;ion
&s;hould always be &s;uitable to the kind and end
of the di&s;cour&s;e. We have formerly &s;aid all that
is nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to the conclu&s;ion of all
&s;orts of lectures and textual di&s;cour&s;es, and likewi&s;e
of tho&s;e which are explicatory of a particular
character. Tho&s;e which are de&s;igned to explain a
duty, may be concluded in different ways &s;uitable
to their de&s;ign. It is very proper, after having
explained fully the &s;everal parts of it, to recapi|tulate
the whole; this will both a&s;&s;i&s;t the hearers
in remembering what has been advanced for the
direction of their conduct, and what can be of no
u&s;e for directing it except, it be remembered; and
will al&s;o &s;end to give them a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion of
the connection and dependence of the parts.
Sometimes a recapitulation is all that is nece&s;&s;ary
in concluding an explicatory di&s;cour&s;e, but it ought
always to be at lea&s;t a part of the conclu&s;ion.
Again, as the de&s;ign of explaining a duty is to
direct the practice of the hearers, and as they will
not think of altering their conduct except they fee
how far they are deficient, exhortations or direc|tions
for examining them&s;elves how far they really
practi&s;e their duty, may very properly &s;ucceed the
recapitulation. Whatever can contribute to their
forming a right judgement of their real character
and conduct in re&s;pect of the virtue or vice that
has been illu&s;trated, may very properly be intro|duced
here. Farther, any directions which may
conduce to their practi&s;ing the virtue or avoiding
<PB N="341" REF="348">
the vice, will ju&s;tly find a place in the conclu&s;ion
of &s;uch an explicatory di&s;cour&s;e. Sometimes ar|guments
for the practice of a duty ari&s;e from the
very view of the nature of that duty. It is im|po&s;&s;ible,
for in&s;tance, to explain re&s;ignation, with|out
mentioning the freedom from inward anxiety
and &s;olicitude which this temper implies. In ca&s;es
of this kind it will not be improper to mention
in the conclu&s;ion, that, in order to recommend
the duty, it is &s;ufficient to under&s;tand its nature,
and to hint at tho&s;e arguments for it which are
&s;o properly internal, as to be implied in the very
conception of it. Sometimes too, in the conclu|&s;ion,
a preacher may addre&s;s exhortations or di|rections
di&s;tinctly to different cla&s;&s;es of his hearers,
according to the different ways in which the duty
explained re&s;pects them; as to tho&s;e who wholly
neglect it, and to tho&s;e who already practi&s;e it in
&s;ome degree; which will give an opportunity of
pointing out and rebuking &s;uch &s;ins or practices as
are remarkably incon&s;i&s;tent with it. Sometimes,
all the&s;e parts may be proper in the conclu&s;ion of
one di&s;cour&s;e; &s;ometimes one or a few of them
will be &s;ufficient. It was already remarked, that a
di&s;cour&s;e intended to prove a doctrine, &s;hould be
concluded by pointing out its influence on practice,
either in &s;everal inferences when it is equally con|nected
with &s;everal duties, or in one deduction
when it is peculiarly &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;ome one branch
of virtue. The fame holds of tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es,
which are employed in explaining a doctrine. It
<PB N="342" REF="349">
remains only therefore to point out briefly, what
ought to be the conclu&s;ion of a &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e.
As the de&s;ign of the whole di&s;cour&s;e is to per&s;uade
men to the practice of &s;ome duty, &s;o the conclu&s;ion
&s;hould evidently be calculated for fixing and con|firming
this effect. What, therefore, ought to be
its nature, will ea&s;ily appear by recollecting what
has been already ob&s;erved on the means of per|&s;ua&s;ion.
Argument is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to it;
the conclu&s;ion, therefore, ought to contain a &s;um|mary
or recapitulation of the &s;everal arguments
which have been urged in the di&s;cour&s;e. It &s;hould
not merely mention the heads of them, but repre|&s;ent
in brief their whole force, and their greate&s;t
&s;trength. It &s;hould, as it were, collect their whole
vigour into one point, that it may be more inten&s;e
and affect the more. But, as argument alone does
not per&s;uade without an addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions,
&s;o the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t contain not only the &s;ub|&s;tance
of the whole arguments, but al&s;o &s;omething
fit to influence and intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions. Indeed,
though the pathetic &s;hould, in a greater or a le&s;s
degree, run through the whole of a &s;ua&s;ory di&s;|cour&s;e,
the conclu&s;ion is the principal &s;eat of it, in
which it will naturally ri&s;e to the greate&s;t degree
of warmth. It is not nece&s;&s;ary here, any more
than in the other parts of the di&s;cour&s;e, that the
argument and the painting, from which the pa|thetic
re&s;ults, &s;hould be kept di&s;tinct. It is much
better that they be incorporated together &s;o per|fectly
as to be blended and undi&s;tingui&s;hable; that
<PB N="343" REF="350">
&s;o the conclu&s;ion may at once collect, as it were,
into one point all the light and all the warmth of
the di&s;cour&s;e, and leave its full effect upon the
hearts of the hearers.</P>

<HEAD>ART. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Di&s;po&s;ition.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;econd exertion of the mind is di&s;po&s;ition,
which is therefore reckoned the &s;econd part of
eloquence. It is employed in reducing the whole
train of the di&s;cour&s;e, and all its parts, into their
proper order. Order con&s;i&s;ts in placing things to|gether
which are naturally connected. Without
a proper di&s;po&s;ition, the materials of a di&s;cour&s;e
would be a mere confu&s;ed chaos. In every art,
the di&s;po&s;ition of the materials is as e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary
as the finding them out.</P>
<P>We are prevented in many ob&s;ervations regard|ing
the particular di&s;po&s;ition proper for the dif|ferent
kinds of di&s;cour&s;es, by the account of each
kind that was formerly given. Some of the mo&s;t
general rules of di&s;po&s;ition are likewi&s;e &s;ufficiently
implied in the recital, that was made under the
la&s;t head, of the order in which the &s;everal parts
of a di&s;cour&s;e naturally &s;ucceed each other. A
few ob&s;ervations upon it will be all that is farther
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="351">
Di&s;po&s;ition regards both the whole plan and
each part of it. In the whole plan that order
&s;hould be ob&s;erved, by which every thing may
prepare the way for what &s;ucceeds, and pre&s;erve
the force of what went before. &startq;Every thing
&s;hould be introduced to the be&s;t advantage, and
where it is fitte&s;t to make a due impre&s;&s;ion.
Often, that which would &s;eem nothing to the
purpo&s;e, by being un&s;ea&s;onably urged, has a
very great weight when it is re&s;erved for its
proper place, till the audience be prepared by
other things to feel all its force and con&s;e|quence.&endq;
The heads of every doctrine, the
parts of every duty, have a natural connection
and dependence, &s;o that one is fir&s;t, and the others
&s;ucceed in a certain order; and this order ought
to be ob&s;erved in explaining them. In proving or
per&s;uading by arguments, there is greater latitude
as to the order. Sometimes, indeed, the argu|ments
have a natural &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;o that one ri&s;es
and grows out of another, and one prepares the
way for another. In this ca&s;e, this natural order
ought to be carefully ob&s;erved; the &s;imple&s;t &s;hould
be placed fir&s;t, and all of them di&s;po&s;ed &s;o that
one may prepare the way for our fully under|&s;tanding
and feeling the force of tho&s;e which fol|low,
and every &s;ucceeding argument may add to
the weight of tho&s;e which went before. But often,
the arguments are more unconnected, &s;o that any
of them may, with little impropriety, be placed
fir&s;t or la&s;t. Here, one is left at liberty to choo&s;e
<PB N="345" REF="352">
any order that he plea&s;es; but even in this ca&s;e,
one order may be better than another. Thus,
&s;ome have advi&s;ed to begin with the weake&s;t argu|ments,
and to proceed gradually to the &s;tronge&s;t,
that &s;o the rea&s;oning, by continually gathering
force, may complete its effect upon the hearers.
Some again have approved of beginning and end|ing
with the &s;tronge&s;t arguments, and throwing
the weaker rea&s;ons into the middle; becau&s;e we
are naturally attentive at the beginning, and if we
be plea&s;ed with what is then &s;aid, we hear the re&s;t
with the more favourable di&s;po&s;ition, and what
comes la&s;t &s;ticks be&s;t with us. But in the di&s;po|&s;ition
of the general parts of a di&s;cour&s;e, a great
deal mu&s;t be left to the judgement of the preacher;
few univer&s;al or invariable rules can be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Order is nece&s;&s;ary not only in this, but in the
arrangement of each particular part. In general,
it is proper on each head or argument, fir&s;t to pro|po&s;e
it briefly, and then to &s;pread it out in the
pro&s;ecution, illu&s;trating or urging the whole of it.
But though it be ea&s;y to di&s;cern when a proper
order is ob&s;erved, or to di&s;cover a particular fault
that is committed, it is not ea&s;y to lay down rules
which would not be either too general to be un|der&s;tood,
or too particular to be u&s;eful in every
ca&s;e. In pa&s;&s;ing from one part of a di&s;cour&s;e to
another, &s;ome form of tran&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary.
Engli&s;h preachers are generally very carele&s;s and
unartificial in this, contenting them&s;elves with
<PB N="346" REF="353">
mentioning one head when they have fini&s;hed an|other,
without being at any pains to run them, as
it were, into one another. Greater care, however,
in this re&s;pect would often be attended with good
effects. A tran&s;ition, for in&s;tance, may be made
from the explication of one part of a duty to that
of another, by hinting how the practice of the
former leads to the latter, or how in&s;ufficient the
former will be without the latter. In pa&s;&s;ing from
one argument to another, whether in a probatory
or a &s;ua&s;ory di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;pecially in the latter, it
will be proper not to &s;eem to give up the former
arguments, or to allow their force to vani&s;h when
we leave them and proceed to others. This will
be be&s;t done by recapitulating the former ones, at
lea&s;t the one immediately preceding, and profe&s;&s;|edly
&s;uperadding the next one to them. Various
ways of doing this will ea&s;ily occur on trial.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="7">
<HEAD>ART. VII. Of Elocution.</HEAD>
<P>The third exertion of the preacher is elocution,
which regards the language, &s;tyle, and compo&s;ition
of &s;ermons. The language of &s;ermons ought, fir&s;t
of all, to be plain and per&s;picuous. In order to at|tain
this, we mu&s;t u&s;e words that are in common
u&s;e, words which are &s;uitable to the &s;ubject, avoid|ing
all technical terms of art, all terms borrowed
from the &s;chools, and all &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as are
ambiguous or equivocal, or as are above the un|der&s;tanding
of the people. &startq;The figures mu&s;t be
<PB N="347" REF="354">
ea&s;y though not mean, &s;uch as tend to make the
matter better under&s;tood.&endq; Too frequent and
too di&s;tant metaphors ob&s;truct per&s;picuity, and turn
the di&s;cour&s;e in &s;ome mea&s;ure into a dark allegory.
All confu&s;ion in the arrangement of words likewi&s;e
produces ob&s;curity. Long periods, &s;uch as contain
in them two or three different thoughts, are hard
to be followed or apprehended. Plainne&s;s ought
to be pre&s;erved in every kind of compo&s;ition, but
mo&s;t of all in explication; for the very de&s;ign of
this being to make things under&s;tood, every degree
of ob&s;curity is perfectly un&s;uitable. The language
of a preacher ought likewi&s;e to be pure; we &s;hould
avoid all &s;oleci&s;ms or faults in con&s;truction, all bar|bari&s;ms,
or words and terms that do not truly be|long
to the language. Mean and low expre&s;&s;ions
are unbecoming the dignity of the pulpit, and the
&s;ublimity of the &s;ubjects which are there treated,
and mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t every per&s;on of any degree of
under&s;tanding. At the &s;ame time very great
nicety and correctne&s;s of &s;tyle is lo&s;t in a di&s;cour&s;e
that is to be but once heard by a common audience.
But a remarkable want of compo&s;ition, an obvious
roughne&s;s and a&s;perity of &s;tyle, is di&s;agreeable.
There mu&s;t be &s;ome degree of harmony in order
to prevent di&s;gu&s;t. The language ought likewi&s;e
to be nervous, animated, and affecting. A great
part of the force of a &s;entiment often depends on
the manner in which it is expre&s;&s;ed. What will
have great force if it be expre&s;&s;ed in one way, will
become perfectly languid and unaffecting by being
<PB N="348" REF="355">
expre&s;&s;ed in another. In general, the language is
forcible and moving, when it is &s;uch as &s;hows that
the &s;peaker is touched with what he &s;ays; this
never fails to affect the hearers. And mo&s;t of the
figures of rhetoric are nothing el&s;e but different
ways of &s;howing this. The&s;e figures are fully
treated by the ancient rhetoricians, to whom we
&s;hall refer you. The &s;tudying them, and having
all their variety in view, will give you an aptitude
and bent to light upon them, when it is proper to
introduce them. In &s;tudying them, it will be pro|per,
fir&s;t, to acquire a di&s;tinct idea of the nature
of each; and next, to con&s;ider what is its real
effect; whether it conduces to per&s;picuity, to or|nament,
or to vehemence. Such a previous know|lege
of them will prevent your introducing them
improperly, and enable you to u&s;e with a good
effect tho&s;e figures which &s;uit the &s;ubject and the
occa&s;ion. It mu&s;t be remarked that any appear|ance
of de&s;ign in introducing figures, or crowding
them together, mu&s;t be carefully avoided. If they
do not appear to ri&s;e naturally from the &s;ubject
and occa&s;ion, without being &s;ought for, they will
defeat their own de&s;ign, and render the di&s;cour&s;e
florid, affected, and di&s;agreeable.</P>

<HEAD>ART. VIII. Of Memory.</HEAD>
<P>The next exertion of mind nece&s;&s;ary in a
preacher is memory; the next excerci&s;e incumbent
on him is to commit to memory the di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="349" REF="356">
which he has invented, compo&s;ed, and expre&s;&s;ed.
In mo&s;t places it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to attempt
proving that this exerci&s;e is incumbent on a public
&s;peaker. To &s;how you, however, that reading is
not approved even by tho&s;e among whom it is mo&s;t
u&s;ed, I &s;hall give you the &s;entiments of Bi&s;hop
Burnet upon it, in his own words. &startq;Reading is
peculiar to this nation, and is endured in no
other. It has indeed made that our &s;ermons
are more exact, and &s;o it has produced us
many volumes of the be&s;t that are extant; but
after all, though &s;ome few read &s;o happily, pro|nounce
&s;o truly, and enter &s;o entirely into tho&s;e
affections which they recommend, that in them
we &s;ee both the correctne&s;s of reading, and the
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of &s;peaking, &s;ermons, yet every one
is not &s;o happy. Some, by hanging their heads
perpetually over their notes, by blundering as
they read, and by a cur&s;ory running over them,
do &s;o le&s;&s;en the matter of their &s;ermons, that as
they are generally read with very little life or
affection, &s;o they are heard with as little regard
or e&s;teem. Tho&s;e who read ought certainly
to be at a little more pains than for the mo&s;t
part they are, to read true, to pronounce with
an empha&s;is, and to rai&s;e their heads, and
direct their eyes to their hearers; and if they
practi&s;ed more alone the ju&s;t way of reading,
they might deliver their &s;ermons with much
more advantage. Man is a low &s;ort of creature;
he does not, nay, for the greater part he can|not,
<PB N="350" REF="357">
not, con&s;ider things in them&s;elves, without tho&s;e
little &s;ea&s;onings that mu&s;t recommend them to
his affections. That a di&s;cour&s;e be heard with
any life, it mu&s;t be &s;poken with &s;ome; and the
looks and motions of the eye do carry in them
&s;uch additions to what is &s;aid, that where the&s;e
do not at all concur, it has not all the force
upon them that otherwi&s;e it might have; be|&s;ides
that the people, who are too apt to cen&s;ure
the clergy, are ea&s;ily carried into an obvious
reflection on reading, that it is an effect of
lazine&s;s<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;toral Care, ch. ix.</NOTE>&endq;</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that this writer di&s;approved read|ing
&s;ermons much more highly than he thought
proper, on account of its univer&s;al prevalence in
England, to declare explicitly. Indeed, the
impropriety of reading &s;ermons ari&s;es from the
very principles of human nature, not from any
groundle&s;s prejudices. It is not the only de&s;ign of
language to communicate the ideas of the &s;peaker,
by exciting them in the minds of the hearers; it is
its de&s;ign likewi&s;e to expre&s;s the &s;entiments and
affections of the &s;peaker, and by this means to rai&s;e
them in the hearers. Reading may an&s;wer the fir&s;t
of the&s;e ends, but it is improper for an&s;wering the
latter. It is not a natural expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;peaker's
being intere&s;ted in what he &s;ays; it does not render
<PB N="351" REF="358">
the hearers attentive, or contribute to touch or
&s;trike them. It is nece&s;&s;arily weaker, more lan|guid,
and more unaffecting than &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Were we to inquire at length concerning me|mory,
we might examine on what the remem|brance
of &s;ingle thoughts, and on what the remem|brance
of their &s;eries or connections, depends; and
we might deduce, from the general principles on
which both depend, the means of rendering both
ea&s;ier. But it will not be nece&s;&s;ary for our pre&s;ent
purpo&s;e to enter &s;o deep into the matter; it will be
&s;ufficient to make a few general remarks upon
mandating.</P>
<P>In order to perform this exerci&s;e ea&s;ily, it is
proper that the memory be &s;u&s;ceptible, &s;o as
quickly to receive what we would commit to it;
di&s;tinct, &s;o as to retain not only the things them|&s;elves,
but likewi&s;e their due order or po&s;ition;
and ready, &s;o as to &s;ugge&s;t them without difficulty,
when we have occa&s;ion for them. The&s;e qualities
of memory are attained by pretty much the &s;ame
means. A thorough under&s;tanding of the &s;ubject
is a great preparation for mandating ea&s;ily; for it
will enable every part to &s;trike us with greater
force. In order to our remembering, it will like|wi&s;e
be proper that we &s;ix clo&s;e attention upon what
we would remember, without allowing our thoughts
to be di&s;tracted or to run off to other &s;ubjects,
when we are engaged in mandating. It is al&s;o
<PB N="352" REF="359">
proper that we dwell on every part till we have
thoroughly acquired it, before we proceed to any
other. If at fir&s;t we &s;hould be able to commit to
memory but a few &s;entences or periods in a day,
we mu&s;t take care to acquire them perfectly before
we proceed to others. Order and di&s;tinctne&s;s in
compo&s;ition, and even writing a di&s;cour&s;e in &s;epa|rate
paragraphs, is of great help to memory; it
makes it more ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible, by &s;aving a great
deal of labour that would be nece&s;&s;ary for impre&s;&s;ing
every &s;ingle thought, if it were either di&s;po&s;ed or
written confu&s;edly; it will make it lie di&s;tinctly in
the mind, and give many handles for recollecting
it. When we have looked over what we would
commit to memory, we &s;hould endeavour to repeat
it to our&s;elves; for this endeavour, and looking to
it when we are at a lo&s;s, will fix it more &s;peedily,
than if we were to read it over much oftener,
without any attempt to recite; and when we find
our&s;elves at a lo&s;s at any particular place, and, by
looking to it, endeavour to fix it, we &s;hall &s;carcely
be in any hazard of finding our&s;elves again at a
lo&s;s at that particular place. It is found by &s;ome
to be of great &s;ervice to look over what they want
to remember, immediately before going to &s;leep at
night, becau&s;e then the mind is not afterwards
bu&s;ied about any ideas which may drive it away;
or to look it over in the morning on fir&s;t getting
up, becau&s;e the mind is not then pre-occupied with
any ideas which may hinder its taking fa&s;t hold of
it. A per&s;on ought at fir&s;t to commit every word
<PB N="353" REF="360">
and &s;yllable to heart, whatever trouble it may co&s;t
him; for this will mo&s;t &s;peedily perfect the habit
of remembering, and make it more ea&s;y for him
to remember afterwards, though he only charge
his memory with the principal things and the
general order of the whole. It will be of great
u&s;e frequently to recollect and endeavour to repeat
what one has committed to memory, at certain
intervals, before delivering it in public; for a man
cannot at fir&s;t promi&s;e on what he has but lately
committed to memory; but the reviewing of it after
a certain interval fixes it in the memory more
deeply than it was before. The&s;e are &s;ome of
the principal means of committing di&s;cour&s;es to
memory. The frequent u&s;e of the&s;e means will
beget a habit of doing it ea&s;ily. No power of the
mind is more improveable by u&s;e than memory:
memory is in no way improveable to &s;o great a
degree as in this exerci&s;e of mandating. U&s;e
makes it incredibly ea&s;y to acquire what we want
to remember; and it produces at the &s;ame time &s;o
&s;trong a habit of recollecting readily, that though
one had committed what he is to &s;ay very imper|fectly
to memory, he will run no ri&s;k of mi&s;&s;ing
any part of it. The u&s;e you &s;hould make of this
is to begin as early as po&s;&s;ible to mandate either
&s;ermons or any thing el&s;e, and to repeat them
either by your&s;elves or in the company of others.
By this means the habit will be formed, and all
the difficulties over, before you come to appear in
public.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="361">
To many, however, mandating a &s;ermon is a
very difficult matter. Where the memory is natu|rally
weak, it will take up &s;o much time as to leave
little for any thing el&s;e; and even with the be&s;t
memory, diffidence and timidity may have &s;uch an
effect upon one, as to make him forget, before a
congregation, what he was perfect ma&s;ter of when
alone in his clo&s;et. Where it can be done with
tolerable ea&s;e, it is certainly mo&s;t natural; the
preacher will feel it mo&s;t agreeable; and, in general,
it will have greater influence on the audience. At
the &s;ame time one ought to have his notes before
him, to which he may have recour&s;e in ca&s;e of his
being at a lo&s;s; otherwi&s;e, if he happen any how to
get di&s;compo&s;ed, he may find it difficult to recover
hini&s;elf.</P>
<P>But though mandating be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to good preaching, good reading is indi&s;pen&s;a|bly
&s;o. To read &s;ervilely, with one's eyes con|&s;tantly
fixed on his papers, is di&s;gu&s;ting to an
audience. It &s;hows &s;omething &s;o cold and lifele&s;s
in a preacher, that what he &s;ays, be it ever &s;o good
in it&s;elf, can never affect his hearers. A preacher
ought always to peru&s;e his &s;ermon till he enter
thoroughly into the &s;pirit of it, and be able, with
a glance at his notes now and then, to deliver it
with facility and propriety. To read well, is an
accompli&s;hment of much greater importance than
many are apt to imagine. It admits of all that
warmth and animation, of all that action which is
<PB N="355" REF="362">
nece&s;&s;ary or becoming in the pulpit, and will, in
a great mea&s;ure, &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of man|dating.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="9">
<HEAD>ART. IX. Of Pronunciation or Action.</HEAD>
<P>The la&s;t exertion employed by the preacher,
and the la&s;t part of eloquence, is Pronunciation or
Action. You will find this topic treated largely
by rhetorical writers, and even very minute rules
for the modulation of the voice and the motion of
the &s;everal parts of the body given by them, e&s;pe|cially
by Quinctilian. We &s;hall therefore &s;tudy the
greater brevity. It is acknowleged by all, that the
&s;everal languages which have prevailed in the
world are merely artificial, and derive their &s;ignifi|cation
wholly from compact or tacit con&s;ent. But
this nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es that men had previou&s;ly
a natural language; for without that, they could
never have expre&s;&s;ed that con&s;ent, or entered into
that compact, from which artificial language derives
its origin. Now, this natural language could be
nothing el&s;e but &s;uch inarticulate &s;ounds and
motions as naturally expre&s;&s;ed the &s;entiments and
pa&s;&s;ions of men. The difficulty and &s;cantine&s;s of
the&s;e made them inconvenient, and rendered arti|ficial
language nece&s;&s;ary. But they had in &s;ome
re&s;pects greatly the advantage of this latter. This
of it&s;elf expre&s;&s;es only ideas; they expre&s;&s;ed all
the movements of the &s;oul; this of it&s;elf is dead
and unanimated; they were animated and alive, as
<PB N="356" REF="363">
it were. Each of them being thus imperfect by
it&s;elf, the perfection of &s;peaking con&s;i&s;ts in uniting
natural and artificial language as much as po&s;&s;ible.
In the union of them, all the rules of pronunciation
and action have their foundation. The natural
inarticulate founds which were in u&s;e before lan|guage
was invented, cannot be mixed with the
articulate founds of which language con&s;i&s;ts; but
their force is united to them when the&s;e articulate
founds are pronounced with the tone and modu|lation
of voice which corre&s;pond to the &s;entiment
or emotion which they &s;ignify. The other part of
natural language, the motions by which men
expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments, may be joined with
language, and con&s;titute what is properly termed
Action. Whatever is incon&s;i&s;tent with the union
of natural and artificial language, whatever implies
the mere u&s;e of the latter without any mixture of
the former, is a fault in pronunciation. The fol|lowing
ob&s;ervations may throw &s;ome light on this
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>Pronunciation includes two parts; the manage|ment
of the voice, and the ge&s;ture of the body. In
general, a great compo&s;ure of both is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary; a gravity and compo&s;ure of look and
voice, equally di&s;tant from a light carele&s;s beha|viour
on the one hand, and an affected tone and
wry faces on the other. Every thing mu&s;t be deli|vered
in &s;uch a manner and with &s;uch an empha&s;is,
as may &s;how that the preacher thoroughly under|&s;tands
<PB N="357" REF="364">
all that he &s;ays, is fully per&s;uaded of it, and
has tho&s;e affections which he de&s;ires to infu&s;e into
others. The pronunciation mu&s;t be always di&s;tinct,
and the action lively, natural, and becoming, &s;uch
as may point out &s;trongly what his words alone
would expre&s;s in a flat and languid manner. An
orator mu&s;t not always have his hands or his body
in motion, for it is not natural to u&s;e many ge&s;|tures
when we &s;ay common things, without any
vehemence or emotion. Both the voice and the
ge&s;ture may have a greater degree of vehemence
in Preaching, than conver&s;ation could properly
admit in &s;aying the &s;ame things; for the &s;ight of
a great audience, the importance of the &s;ubject,
and the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion, will naturally
give a greater degree of warmth than one could
have in di&s;cour&s;ing familiarly with his friends. It
is &s;ometimes proper to expre&s;s &s;ome things with
a le&s;s degree of force than their nature would &s;eem
to require, e&s;pecially when they are to be followed
by things which require the utmo&s;t force of pro|nunciation
and action; for men may wa&s;te their
&s;pirits &s;o much in &s;aying plain things, as to be
forced to utter tho&s;e things faintly which ought to
be delivered with a vehement action; but when
the preacher &s;ays things le&s;s warm with an ea&s;y and
familiar manner, he will the more ea&s;ily grow ve|hement,
and attain energy of voice and action
when the &s;ubject mo&s;t requires it; and the audience
will then be mo&s;t affected. One of the mo&s;t com|mon
faults both in voice and action is a monotony
<PB N="358" REF="365">
or &s;amene&s;s running through the whole, however
different the &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed may be. Many
things concur to lead men into this, as their not
having previou&s;ly &s;tudied the varieties of pronun|ciation,
the difficulty which they find at fir&s;t in
recollecting readily what they are to &s;ay, the being
obliged to &s;peak above the ordinary tone of their
voice in conver&s;ation. But it &s;hould be carefully
avoided; it appears tolerable when the cant or
tone is harmonious, but it is always improper and
unnatural. When one's words are dictated by
his feelings, he always u&s;es many different ge&s;tures
and inflections of the voice, according to the differ|ent
feelings by which he is actuated. If one
would preach naturally, his voice mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume a
variety of proper tones and inflections, and ri&s;e
and fall with a ju&s;t and ea&s;y cadence according to
the nature of the things which he expre&s;&s;es. In
the &s;ame way, the action &s;hould be varied &s;o as to
&s;uit both the &s;ubject and the variations of the
voice. The be&s;t way of di&s;covering what is the
tone and ge&s;ture &s;uitable to any particular &s;ubject,
is to ob&s;erve tho&s;e which men have when they are,
unde&s;ignedly and without premeditation, engaged
on &s;uch a &s;ubject. By ob&s;erving how men &s;peak
and move when they would explain any thing,
you may &s;ee what is the tone of voice and ge&s;ture
which fits explication. &startq;Ob&s;erve what is the
po&s;ture, and what the voice of one, who&s;e
heart is pierced with &s;orrow, or &s;urpri&s;ed at the
&s;ight of an a&s;toni&s;hing object; remark the na|tural
<PB N="359" REF="366">
action of the eyes, what the hands do, and
what the whole body;&endq; and where the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions
are concerned, let your manner be the &s;ame. It
is nece&s;&s;ary that there be no appearance of affect|ation,
either in the voice or action; and yet,
without endeavour and &s;tudy at fir&s;t, it will be
impo&s;&s;ible ever to attain a proper manner. The
only cour&s;e, therefore, that can be taken, is to
employ one&s;elf much in whatever tends to form a
proper manner, before one has occa&s;ion to &s;peak
in public, that he may not expo&s;e him&s;elf to ridi|cule,
or prevent the effect of the di&s;cour&s;e, either
by improprieties, or by an appearance of art and
&s;tudy. You may begin with ob&s;erving the va|rieties
of voice and action de&s;cribed by rhetorical
writers; accu&s;tom your&s;elves to perform each of
them ea&s;ily and readily; remark which of them
&s;uits every particular &s;ubject or pa&s;&s;ion; frequently
repeat &s;omething which gives you an opportunity
of trying them, either by your&s;elves, or rather,
when you can, in the company of others, who
may ob&s;erve any improprieties into which you fall.
By frequent exerci&s;e in this way, you may acquire,
before you appear in public, &s;uch a variety of
graceful pronunciation and action, that when you
are engaged in your &s;ubject, you will naturally fall
into what &s;uits it, without any de&s;ign or thought.</P>
<P>Thus we have con&s;idered &s;ermons both with
re&s;pect to their kinds and their parts. There are
many ob&s;ervations of great importance which might
<PB N="360" REF="367">
be made concerning Preaching, con&s;idered in a
moral or practical, rather than a critical view; as,
that &s;ermons ought to convey the truths of reli|gion
pure and unmixed; in the language of &s;crip|ture
as much as po&s;&s;ible; in a way &s;uited to the
capacities of the hearers; in a way that is mo&s;t
likely to promote their reformation; in a way
which &s;hows that the preacher feels him&s;elf the
whole force of the truths which he believes. But
we &s;hall not enlarge on the&s;e; they are fully treated
in many writings, particularly in &s;ome &s;ermons on
this &s;ubject, which are well known, and to which
you can have ea&s;y acce&s;s,</P>
<P>When a per&s;on is &s;ettled in a congregation, it
is proper that in Preaching he &s;hould ob&s;erve &s;ome
regular &s;eries or order, that all the parts of reli|gion
may be illu&s;trated in their real connection
and dependence. For, in every &s;cience, order in
teaching is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, The plan which
a mini&s;ter lays down &s;hould not be either too &s;hort,
el&s;e &s;ubjects mu&s;t be treated &s;uperficially; or too
long, el&s;e the very end of it will be fru&s;trated,
becau&s;e many of the hearers will not live to &s;ee it
completed. There are many different plans into
which a cour&s;e of &s;ermons may very properly be
dige&s;ted, &s;ome of which may be mo&s;t agreeable to
one, and others to another, and which the &s;ame
man may, for the &s;ake of variety, follow at dif|ferent
times. Thus, one may follow an hi&s;torical
order, in which &s;ubjects will &s;ucceed one another
<PB N="361" REF="368">
in &s;ome &s;uch way as this. The being of God, his
attributes, the creation, the fall and its con&s;e|quences,
the nature and u&s;e of the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen|&s;ation,
the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation; the life, death,
and exaltation of our Saviour; the effects of his
mediation, the go&s;pel terms of acceptance, the
various duties of Chri&s;tianity, death, judgement,
heaven, and hell. I mention this one only as a
&s;pecimen, and I mention only the mo&s;t general
heads. Whatever plan is cho&s;en, the doctrines and
the duties of religion ought to be intermixed with
one another, that their real connection may ap|pear.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a mini&s;ter's ordinary cour&s;e of &s;ermons,
there are occa&s;ional di&s;cour&s;es which he mu&s;t
&s;ometimes u&s;e, as on fa&s;ts and thank&s;givings,
about the time of &s;acraments, at &s;ynods, and the
like. The&s;e are &s;ubject to the very &s;ame rules of
compo&s;ition with other &s;ermons. The matter of
the&s;e &s;hould always be &s;uch as &s;uits the particular
occa&s;ion of them, and excites to the practice of
the particular duties which the occa&s;ion requires.
And it mu&s;t be left to the preacher to judge what
appears to him to have the&s;e characters. No
doubt &s;ome general directions may be given. Thus,
on a public fa&s;t, it is proper to give &s;uch a view
of the calamity which occa&s;ions it, as may excite
the hearers to repentance: on a public thank&s;|giving,
&s;uch a di&s;play of the ble&s;&s;ings acknow|leged
as may inflame their gratitude: on a fa&s;t
<PB N="362" REF="369">
day before a &s;acrament, what might either urge
them to repentance, or direct them in the exerci&s;e
of it: on a Saturday, or in an action &s;ermon,
what is fit to excite tho&s;e affections which &s;hould
be exerted in commemorating the death of Chri&s;t:
in the afternoon or on Monday, what may con|firm
their good impre&s;&s;ions, and per&s;uade them to
the practice of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>There is one thing more that will de&s;erve to be
taken notice of on the &s;ubject of Preaching; whe|ther
writing di&s;cour&s;es regularly, or Preaching on
mere premeditation, be the preferable way. This
latter way has been warmly recommended by two
writers on the &s;ubject of Preaching, Bi&s;hop Burnet
in his Pa&s;toral Care, and the Archbi&s;hop of Cam|bray
in his Dialogues concerning eloquence. They
propo&s;e that a man &s;hould be at great pains to
prepare him&s;elf for Preaching without writing, for
&s;everal years before he attempt it, by acquiring
great knowlege of the &s;criptures, by comparing
together tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which belong to the &s;ame
&s;ubject; by often laying them together, and di|ge&s;ting
in his thoughts what ari&s;es from them upon
any &s;ubject; by acquiring a di&s;tinct and connected
idea of the whole body of divinity, and by furni&s;h|ing
his mind with a large collection of &s;entiments
from practical writers upon all kinds of &s;ubjects.
Being provided with the&s;e materials, in order to
qualify him&s;elf for this way of Preaching, he mu&s;t
accu&s;tom him&s;elf to talk freely to him&s;elf, and let
<PB N="363" REF="370">
his thoughts flow ea&s;ily from him; he mu&s;t fre|quently
write on all &s;orts of &s;ubjects, that he may
bring him&s;elf to correctne&s;s both in thinking and
&s;peaking; he mu&s;t for &s;ome years accu&s;tom him&s;elf
to preach as it were to him&s;elf on all &s;orts of &s;ub|jects
once or twice every day, that he may acquire
an ea&s;ine&s;s both of thought and of expre&s;&s;ion;
above all, he mu&s;t have in him&s;elf a deep &s;en&s;e of
the truth and power of religion, and mu&s;t, by
meditation and prayer, draw down divine influ|ences,
which are always to be expected when a
man puts him&s;elf in the way of them, and prepares
him&s;elf for them. This preparation will enable
him to pour out true thoughts in ju&s;t and ea&s;y
expre&s;&s;ions. But even after all this preparation,
he mu&s;t at fir&s;t try &s;maller excur&s;ions from his
fixed thoughts; and as he &s;ucceeds in the&s;e, he
may give him&s;elf farther &s;cope; and &s;o, by long
practice, he will at la&s;t arrive at &s;o great an ea&s;i|ne&s;s
both in thinking and &s;peaking, that a very
little meditation will &s;erve him for preparing a
&s;ermon. If one be to try Preaching in this way,
it is nece&s;&s;ary that he meditate &s;o carefully on his
&s;ubject beforehand, as to have a di&s;tinct and com|prehen&s;ive
view of it, as to reduce his thoughts
into proper method, as to have thought of the
&s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions and figures. It is &s;uppo&s;ed
that in this way he mu&s;t have a great advantage
in the freedom and force of his pronunciation and
action; he will &s;peak in an ea&s;y, unaffected way,
<PB N="364" REF="371">
and not like a formal declaimer; he can vary his
di&s;cour&s;e according to the occa&s;ions which ca&s;t up
while he is delivering it.</P>
<P>In my opinion, the&s;e writers have carried the
matter too far. It is very proper that a man
&s;hould be able to preach in the way they recom|mend,
when it is nece&s;&s;ary; but no man ought
always to preach in this way. If he do, he will
run into trite common-place topics; his compo|&s;itions
will be loo&s;e and unconnected; his lan|guage
often coar&s;e or confu&s;ed; and diffidence, or
care to recollect his &s;ubject, will de&s;troy the ma|nagement
of his voice. At any rate, a per&s;on
&s;hould accu&s;tom him&s;elf to compo&s;e regular di&s;|cour&s;es
for many years after he begins to preach,
before he attempt this method, except in &s;hort
excur&s;ions, or when ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity requires it.</P>
<P>It is the de&s;ign of all the di&s;cour&s;es that are
pre&s;cribed here, to prepare you for the bu&s;ine&s;s of
Preaching. In order to their doing &s;o, it is be&s;t
that you compo&s;e ju&s;t &s;uch lectures and &s;ermons
as &s;hould be delivered in public; that you imagine
your&s;elves preaching to a congregation, and make
your &s;entiments, your method, your language,
your pronunciation, and your action, preci&s;ely &s;uch
as you would think proper for a popular audience.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of pre&s;iding in the ordinary Public Wor&s;hip of God,
admini&s;tering the Sacraments, and conducting
Public Wor&s;hip on extraordinary occa&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already con&s;idered the &s;everal private
duties of the pa&s;toral office, and we have largely
explained Preaching, which is the fir&s;t public duty
of this office that we took notice of. The other
public duties incumbent on a mini&s;ter, which pecu|liarly
regard the pari&s;h in which he is &s;ettled, may
be reduced to the&s;e: Pre&s;iding in the ordinary
public wor&s;hip of God, admini&s;tering the &s;acra|ments,
and conducting public wor&s;hip on extra|ordinary
occa&s;ions. In explaining the&s;e as duties
of the pa&s;toral office, it would be &s;uperfluous to
attempt a large explication of the nature of prayer
or of the &s;acraments. In the view which we here
take of them, it will be &s;ufficient to make &s;uch
ob&s;ervations as tend to &s;how how a mini&s;ter may
perform with propriety his particular part in the&s;e
&s;acred offices.</P>
<P>In the primitive church, the manner in which
public wor&s;hip was conducted &s;eems to have been
this. &startq;When the congregation was a&s;&s;embled,
the fir&s;t act of divine &s;ervice which they per|formed
was reading the &s;criptures. When the
reading of the &s;criptures was ended, then fol|lowed
the &s;inging of p&s;alms, either &s;uch as
<PB N="366" REF="373">
were taken out of the &s;criptures, or &s;uch hymns
as were compo&s;ed by any of them&s;elves; and
the&s;e they were always careful to &s;ing <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
in good tune and concert. When the
&s;inging of p&s;alms was ended, then &s;ucceeded
the preaching of the word. As &s;oon as the
&s;ermon was ended, then all the congregation ro&s;e
up to pre&s;ent their common and public prayers
to God, &s;tr&eacute;tching out their hands, and lifting
up their eyes to Heaven, and the mini&s;ter with
a mode&s;t and &s;upplicating voice pre&s;ented, in
the name of the congregation, prayers &s;uited to
their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.&endq; The manner of
public wor&s;hip pre&s;cribed by the directory of our
church coincides, in almo&s;t every material circum|&s;tance,
with this, which was ob&s;erved in the
church at lea&s;t for three centuries. It appoints
that, the congregation being a&s;&s;embled, the mi|ni&s;ter
&s;hould begin with a &s;hort prayer, impre&s;&s;ing
them with a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence, and
begging God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance and acceptance. Next,
the &s;criptures are to be read in their order. Then
p&s;alms are to be &s;ung. After this, the mini&s;ter is
again to pray. Preaching &s;ucceeds this prayer.
The &s;ermon being ended, the mini&s;ter is again to
pray. After prayer, a p&s;alm is to be &s;ung, and
then the mini&s;ter is to di&s;mi&s;s the congregation with
a &s;olemn ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e parts, preaching has been already
con&s;idered; reading the &s;criptures has &s;omehow
gone into di&s;u&s;e; perhaps it has been in&s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="367" REF="374">
jo&s;tled out by lecturing; &s;ometimes a chapter
which was read, would require &s;ome ob&s;ervations
for explaining it; and from making the&s;e after it
had been read, men, at fir&s;t perhaps conceited of
their own abilities, and fond of &s;peaking, came by
degrees to comment on every piece of &s;cripture
which they read, till at la&s;t the very notion of a
lecture's being intended chiefly for reading a piece
of &s;cripture is wholly lo&s;t. Reading the &s;criptures
&s;eems to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential a part of
Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, that the omi&s;&s;ion of it is the
mo&s;t faulty defect in the pre&s;ent practice of our
church. Yet &s;o great is the perver&s;ene&s;s and
weak bigotry of many, that in &s;ome places it
would almo&s;t create a &s;chi&s;m to attempt to intro|duce
it; and even the authority of our directory,
framed in the revered ages of the church, would
not be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure from blame the per&s;on
who introduced it. I know nothing, however,
which better de&s;erves a man's running the ri&s;k of
giving offence, than re&s;toring the public reading of
the &s;criptures. In &s;ome places it might perhaps be
attempted without offence, and there it &s;hould be
attempted. It might perhaps, in mo&s;t places, be
introduced gradually, by lecturing on large por|tions
of &s;cripture, fir&s;t making the explication
&s;horter than ordinary, then pa&s;&s;ing over &s;ome of
the ea&s;ier ver&s;es without any explication; then
explaining only a few of the mo&s;t difficult ver&s;es;
and afterwards, reading a whole chapter, and
only &s;ubjoining &s;ome practical ob&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="375">
The only part that remains of ordinary public
wor&s;hip, on which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make
any ob&s;ervations for directing the mini&s;ter in the
part he is to act in it, is prayer. In churches
where compo&s;ed liturgies are u&s;ed, a mini&s;ter has
nothing to do but to read their prayers; he need
only &s;tudy to pronounce them with gravity and
affection, and with a due &s;lowne&s;s and empha&s;is,
which will be mo&s;t effectually attained by bringing
his mind to an inward and feeling &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e
things that are prayed for. But in our church,
where no liturgy is impo&s;ed, a great deal depends
on the mini&s;ter, and, therefore he ought to be at
the greate&s;t pains to fit him&s;elf for performing this
important part of wor&s;hip in a proper manner. It
would be foreign to our pre&s;ent de&s;ign to con&s;ider
the point of impo&s;ed liturgies as a theological
que&s;tion. But it may prepare the way for &s;ome of
the ob&s;ervations which we are to make concerning
public prayer, to begin with ob&s;erving, that both
e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of prayer and the total want of
them have &s;ome advantages and &s;ome inconve|niences.
When public forms are appointed, the
people may be &s;uppo&s;ed to know more perfectly
what are the devotions in which they are to join,
to have a better opportunity of bringing them|&s;elves
beforehand to the temper which &s;uits them,
and may enable them to join with &s;incerity in
them. They may likewi&s;e be carefully drawn up
by per&s;ons of abilities, and may thus prevent many
ab&s;urdities into which weak and ignorant mini&s;ters,
<PB N="369" REF="376">
tru&s;ting wholly to their own gifts, may &s;ometimes
run. But it mu&s;t be acknowleged, on the other
hand, that when &s;et forms are impo&s;ed, they can|not
be &s;o exactly &s;uited to particular circum&s;tances
and emergencies as might be wi&s;hed: they mu&s;t
be gone over &s;o often that they become tire&s;ome
and di&s;gu&s;ting, or at lea&s;t unaffecting both to the
mini&s;ter and to the people, and, by thus degene|rating
into mere form, prevent all the good effect
which might re&s;ult from a previous acquaintance
with them. Praying without &s;et forms may, doubt|le&s;s
too, be productive of &s;ome inconveniences.
Thus, when the audience know that the prayers
are the performance of the preacher him&s;elf, they
are too apt to con&s;ider them as a &s;pecimen of his
abilities, to attend to them with a view to form a
judgement of his talents, and thus to be diverted
from expre&s;&s;ing their devotion in the words that
he u&s;es, which ought to be their only employ|ment.
This appears to me to be the inconvenience
which is mo&s;t in&s;eparable from public prayer with|out
e&s;tabli&s;hed forms. The be&s;t means of curing
it will be, frequently to inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity of
joining heartily in prayer, and to contrive his
prayers &s;o that they may be fit to affect them with
devotion, and to rai&s;e their minds in the exerci&s;e of
it. It might however, without the impo&s;ition of
forms, be effectually remedied by a proper direc|tory
(&s;uch as our own is in &s;ome mea&s;ure), con|taining
either a variety of forms, any of which
might be u&s;ed, or a large collection of materials
<PB N="370" REF="377">
for prayer, out of which a choice may be made,
put into the hands of the people, recommended to
their &s;tudy, and rendered by this means &s;ufficiently
known to them. The other inconveniencies which
are &s;ometimes imputed to prayer without &s;et forms,
really ari&s;e from faults in the manner of performing
it, and will be avoided by mini&s;ters taking care to
perform it in a proper manner.</P>
<P>Thus it is &s;aid that the people cannot join in
prayer, of which they know nothing beforehand,
and into which the preacher may perhaps throw
peculiar &s;entiments of his own, in which the con|gregation
do not agree with him. But this ob|jection
can lie only again&s;t prayers which are very
ill contrived. The proper matter of prayer all are
acquainted with, and can join in, and none are
wholly ignorant of the language in which it may be
mo&s;t fi$ly expre&s;&s;ed. The mini&s;ter, while he con|fines
him&s;elf to the proper &s;ubject of prayer, can
have no occa&s;ion to throw in peculiar &s;entiments of
his own. In public prayers, he &s;hould confine
him&s;elf to tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of adoration, thank&s;|giving,
confe&s;&s;ion, and petition, which are appli|cable
to all, and might with propriety come from
the mouth of any of the congregation. Peculiari|ties
are proper for private devotions, not for
public. Every part of public prayer ought, as
much as po&s;&s;ible, to be expre&s;&s;ed in the language of
&s;cripture, which is both the mo&s;t weighty in it&s;elf,
and the mo&s;t familiar to the congregation. When
<PB N="371" REF="378">
other expre&s;&s;ions are mixed with it, they ought to
be as plain and &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible. Pompous,
affected, and ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ions are wholly im|proper
for devotion. When the proper matter of
prayer is thus kept to and expre&s;&s;ed, all may bring
them&s;elves to a fit temper for joining &s;incerely in it
as ea&s;ily as if they knew the whole compo&s;ition
beforehand, and at the &s;ame time they are freed
from the deadne&s;s and coldne&s;s which the con&s;tant
u&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hed forms is apt to produce.</P>
<P>If per&s;ons not re&s;trained to impo&s;ed forms ever
run into ab&s;urdities for want of them, it is owing
not to the u&s;e of extemporary prayer it&s;elf, but to
a wrong manner in u&s;ing it. Becau&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed
forms of prayer are not publicly impo&s;ed, it does
not therefore follow that arbitrary forms may not
be u&s;ed; that a mini&s;ter may not him&s;elf compo&s;e
or collect forms proper for the different occa&s;ions
on which he is to u&s;e them. Becau&s;e a mini&s;ter is
not obliged to read a liturgy pre&s;cribed by autho|rity,
it does not therefore follow that he is to pour
out &s;uch petitions or devotions as occur to him,
without any method, choice, or premeditation.
On the contrary, we ought to be as careful about
what we &s;ay in prayer, as about what we &s;ay in
preaching, as &s;olicitous to &s;peak with propriety
when we addre&s;s our&s;elves to God, as when we
addre&s;s the congregation. When a per&s;on fir&s;t
begins to appear in public, it will be very proper
that he prepare his prayers with as great care and
<PB N="372" REF="379">
regularity as his &s;ermons. It will likewi&s;e begenerally
proper, when any particular or public occa&s;ion
demands a con&s;iderable peculiarity in the &s;ubject or
manner of prayer, to compo&s;e devotions &s;uited to
it. By this means, a preacher of moderate under|&s;tanding
will be able to avoid every thing unbecom|ing
in prayer, and to perform it with greater pro|priety,
and &s;o as to rai&s;e more &s;ervent devotion
both in him&s;elf and in others, than by going over
public forms. If a per&s;on compo&s;e a variety of
prayers in this way, and become thoroughly ma&s;ter
of them, he will &s;oon be furni&s;hed with &s;uch
abundance of materials for prayer, that he can
ea&s;ily perform this part of public wor&s;hip after|wards,
without the nece&s;&s;ity of either compo&s;ing a
di&s;tinct form of prayer for every occa&s;ion, or
recurring con&s;tantly upon the &s;ame form or the
&s;ame expre&s;&s;ions; but mixing together and di&s;|po&s;ing
in different manners, according to the
pre&s;ent impul&s;e of his mind or the nature of the
occa&s;ion, tho&s;e petitions and devotions which he
had formerly dige&s;ted into &s;everal di&s;tinct prayers.
There is another way which a preacher may take,
and which he &s;hould &s;uperadd to the former, for
forming him&s;elf to a readine&s;s, a copiou&s;ne&s;s and
variety in public prayer. He &s;hould collect toge|ther,
and write down, &s;uch proper adorations,
expre&s;&s;ions of prai&s;e, petitions, and acknowlege|ments,
as he meets with, particularly in reading
the &s;criptures; he &s;hould write them down in any
order in which they occur. By this means he will
<PB N="373" REF="380">
in a &s;hort time obtain a large &s;tock, and by fre|quently
looking it over and fixing it in his mind,
the &s;everal things which he has written down will
occur to him readily when he has occa&s;ion for
them, without his needing to dige&s;t them into form
before-hand; one thing will &s;ugge&s;t another con|nected
with it; and the di&s;po&s;ition of his prayers,
dictated in this manner by the pre&s;ent temper of
his mind, will be more ea&s;y and natural, and will
render them more &s;triking and affecting, than if it
had been contrived coolly in his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t other ob&s;ervations which might be made
concerning public prayer, regard it rather as a
Chri&s;tian duty, than the peculiar part which a
mini&s;ter has in it by pre&s;iding in the public wor&s;hip.
There is one, however, that we may briefly touch
upon, the order in which the parts of prayer may
be mo&s;t properly di&s;po&s;ed. This may, no doubt,
be different, and the proportion of time allowed
to each will vary according to different occa&s;ions.
In general, adoration is proper in the beginning,
to &s;trike us with a &s;en&s;e of the Divine Pre&s;ence,
and to excite, by the contemplation of God's per|fections,
tho&s;e pious and devout affections which
&s;hould prevail in the mind when it is engaged in
prayer. From adoration, the tran&s;ition to prai&s;e
and thank&s;giving is extremely ea&s;y and natural.
Thank&s;giving will be very properly &s;ucceeded by
petitions for mercy, and, as connected with the&s;e,
by confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in and expre&s;&s;ions of repentance.
<PB N="374" REF="381">
Petitions, not only for the direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of God's &s;pirit, but likewi&s;e for all good things
to our&s;elves and others, will be very properly in|troduced
by the&s;e. But, in fact, there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity
for keeping the&s;e &s;everal parts di&s;tinct. It
is better to intermix them through the whole of
prayer. This is the mo&s;t ordinary method in the
devotional parts of &s;cripture, which are the be&s;t
models we can follow. It is the mo&s;t natural ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of a mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by devotion, and ac|tuated
by piety. It gives fuller &s;cope for expre&s;&s;|ing
all the variety of affections which are combined
in a pious temper. Indeed, though tho&s;e which
we have mentioned are commonly reckoned all the
parts of devotion, yet there are &s;ome affections
which it is extremely proper to exert in devotion,
that are not properly reducible to any of them.
Such are expre&s;&s;ions of our tru&s;t in God, of our
re&s;ignation to his will, of our good re&s;olutions, of
our regard to God's judgement of us, of our
delight in him, of our &s;en&s;e of the beauty and
excellence of holine&s;s; the&s;e are rather implied or
&s;uppo&s;ed in &s;ome of the parts of prayer, than
explicitly contained in them. But, by con&s;idering
prayer, not as compo&s;ed of &s;o many parts which
&s;hould &s;ucceed each other in order, but as an
exertion and expre&s;&s;ion of a pious and holy temper,
we may very properly introduce the expre&s;&s;ions
of all its branches, not confu&s;edly, yet &s;o as not
to be &s;crupulous in keeping them &s;eparate and
di&s;tinct.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="382">
The next public duty of the pa&s;toral office is
the admini&s;tration of the Chri&s;tian &s;acraments.
The&s;e are two, Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper,
which we &s;hall con&s;ider briefly, not in every view
that might be taken of them, but &s;imply in this
one view of its being a part of a mini&s;ter's function
to di&s;pen&s;e them in &s;uch a way as to render them
mo&s;t u&s;eful to Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>To begin with Bapti&s;m. It is very nece&s;&s;ary
that a mini&s;ter in&s;truct his people frequently con|cerning
the nature of bapti&s;m, that they may not
go about it as a ceremony, as it is too vi&s;ible the
greater part do, but that they may attend to its
real de&s;ign and importance. As it is very proper
to in&s;truct parents in this privately when they
de&s;ire to have their children bapti&s;ed, &s;o no time
is more &s;uitable for in&s;tructing the congregation
publicly concerning it, than when it is to be di&s;|pen&s;ed.
As it is not convenient to make long
di&s;cour&s;es on the&s;e occa&s;ions, it will be proper to
confine one&s;elf to &s;ome one view of it at each
time. And it may be con&s;idered in many differ|ent
views, each of which will convey a &s;triking
conception of its nature and u&s;e. It will be unne|ce&s;&s;ary
to go over all the&s;e views; every place of
&s;cripture almo&s;t in which it is mentioned, &s;ets it
in a light &s;omewhat peculiar. To give a few in|&s;tances
of the different lights in which it may be
&s;et. At one time it may be very proper to point
out the foundation of ritual duties in our mixed
<PB N="376" REF="383">
and compounded natures, their nece&s;&s;ity. for ex|citing
us to holine&s;s by &s;uch ceremonies as &s;trike
the &s;en&s;es, the pronene&s;s of men in all ages to
abu&s;e them, and to &s;ub&s;titute them in the place of
true goodne&s;s, the care of our Saviour to prevent
this by the &s;implicity apd &s;ignificance of his po&s;i|tive
in&s;titutions, and particularly of bapti&s;m. At
another time, one may enlarge on its being an in|&s;titution
of our Saviour, and therefore, its de|&s;erving
our clo&s;e&s;t attention to the real de&s;ign and
intention of it. Sometimes one may repre&s;ent it
as the &s;ign of our believing the truths of the go&s;pel
and receiving its precepts, from our Saviour com|manding
his di&s;ciples tp bapti&s;e men in the name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, and
to teach men at the &s;ame time to ob&s;erve all things
what&s;oever he had commanded them. At other
times it may be repre&s;ented as, both by the de|clarations
of &s;cripture and the original manner of
di&s;pen&s;ing it, an emblem of a &s;piritual death and
re&s;urrection. Sometimes it may be repre&s;ented
as the &s;eal of tho&s;e religious privileges which God
has freely be&s;towed on the Chri&s;tian church as
means of holine&s;s and improvement, as admitting
tho&s;e who are bapti&s;ed, to them, and as, a &s;ign of
the obligation which the enjoyment of the&s;e pri|vileges
lays us under to the practice of holine&s;s.
At other times it may be repre&s;ented as a &s;tipu|lation
to walk worthy of the Chri&s;tian vocation;
which it is of great importance to fulfil &s;o as to
pre&s;erve a good con&s;cience. Many different views
<PB N="377" REF="384">
of it will occur by careful attention to its nature,
and to the &s;everal places of &s;cripture relating to it.
It will generally be &s;ufficient to give one of the&s;e
views of it at once. But whatever view of it be
given, it &s;hould be made to i&s;&s;ue in urging all pre|&s;ent
to walk &s;uitably to their Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion,
and inculcating on them the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>As in the fir&s;t ages of the go&s;pel, when the
per&s;ons bapti&s;ed were adult, they were obliged at
their bapti&s;m to profe&s;s that they believed the go|&s;pel
of Chri&s;t, were willing to engage in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of it, and re&s;olved to walk worthy of this
profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o now, when infants are bapti&s;ed, it
is proper that &s;ome profe&s;&s;ions and &s;tipulations
&s;hould be exacted from their parents or &s;pon&s;ors.
It is proper that they mould be obliged to make
public profe&s;&s;ion of their own belief of the go&s;pel.
This profe&s;&s;ion ought to be confined to the funda|mental
and uncontroverted truths of religion, and
not extended to any of the di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets of
a party; for bapti&s;m is an in&s;titution of Je&s;us, not
of any leader of a &s;ect; it is the &s;ign of our ad|mi&s;&s;ion
into the Chri&s;tian church, not of our ad|mi&s;&s;ion
into any particular divi&s;ion of Chri&s;tians.
It is likewi&s;e proper to exact an engagement from
the parents or &s;pon&s;ors, to in&s;truct the child in the
whole doctrine of the go&s;pel, in the import of its
having been bapti&s;ed, and to fulfil their obligations
to take care of its education.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="385">
Both the propriety of the thing it&s;elf, and the
con&s;tant and univer&s;al practice of the Chri&s;tian
church requires that the exacting of the&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions
and engagements &s;hould be followed by
prayer and invocation of God, which, on this oc|ca&s;ion,
may very properly con&s;i&s;t in acknowlege|ments
of God's goodne&s;s, particularly in the go|&s;pel,
in the continuance of it from one generation
to another, in making us and our children par|takers
in his covenant, in his freely be&s;towing
upon us our Chri&s;tian privileges, in his appointing
this &s;en&s;ible action as a &s;ign of our being inve&s;ted
with them, and in petitions that he may ble&s;s his
own ordinance of bapti&s;m at the time, that he may
join the inward bapti&s;m of his &s;pirit with the out|ward
bapti&s;m of water, that the wa&s;hing with water
may not be an empty ceremony to the child, but
may be followed by that purity of heart and life,
of which it is de&s;igned to be only a type and re|pre&s;entation.</P>
<P>When the ble&s;&s;ing of God is, in &s;ome &s;uch way
as this, implored on his in&s;titution, bapti&s;m it&s;elf is
performed by &s;prinkling, along with a repetition
of the words of in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The di&s;pen&s;ing of bapti&s;m is very properly fol|lowed
by prayer, that it may be rendered effectual
to the &s;alvation of the child, that it may be fol|lowed
by &s;anctification and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, that
the child, now a member of the Chri&s;tian church
<PB N="379" REF="386">
and admitted to the outward privileges of the
go&s;pel, may become a member of God's true in|vi&s;ible
church, and be received into the enjoyment
of the eternal ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, that the pa|rents
may be enabled to perform their duty to
their child and family, and all the duties incum|bent
on them, and that all pre&s;ent may walk
worthy of their holy vocation; and to the&s;e prayers
&s;uited to the in&s;titution, any of the proper mate|rials
of devotion may be added as occa&s;ion re|quires.</P>
<P>The rules and practice regarding the circum|&s;tances
in which any alteration is to be made in
any of the ordinary methods of di&s;pen&s;ing bap|ti&s;m,
are &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it will not be
nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge upon them. Some ca&s;es of
difficulty may, no doubt, occur; but as the&s;e can|not
be fore&s;een or enumerated, it mu&s;t be left to
a man's own prudence and the be&s;t advice he can
obtain, to direct him in the&s;e ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The other Chri&s;tian &s;acrament is the Lord's
Supper. It is very nece&s;&s;ary to explain properly
the nature of this in&s;titution, both in preaching
and in private, that the people may be guarded
again&s;t the two extremes of irreverence and &s;uper|&s;tition.
This is a part of teaching; but we are
at pre&s;ent to con&s;ider this &s;acrament only in the
view of di&s;pen&s;ing it in &s;uch a way, that it may
tend mo&s;t to the end for which it was de&s;igned,
<PB N="380" REF="387">
the promoting of true holine&s;s and goodne&s;s. All
who profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity are not to be promi&s;eu|ou&s;ly
admitted to it. They who are either gro&s;sly
ignorant, or openly and cu&s;tomarily vicious in any
particular way, act un&s;uitably to the common pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of Chri&s;tianity; and nothing could tend
more to bring this &s;olemn act of wor&s;hip into con|tempt,
than to admit the&s;e to it, who, it is plain,
could not perform it acceptably. At the &s;ame
time, one &s;hould avoid the other extreme of too
great rigour and, &s;everity in excluding per&s;ons on
account of tho&s;e faults, which may be re&s;olved
into the weakne&s;s of the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and may be
con&s;i&s;tent with &s;incere goodne&s;s. The proper light
in which it &s;hould be con&s;idered is, that it is a
means of improvement, but at the &s;ame time a
means of improvement which cannot be u&s;ed to
advantage, except by tho&s;e who have already &s;ome
degree of good di&s;po&s;itions. In this view of it, it
is plainly ab&s;urd to require &s;o great a degree of
perfection in tho&s;e who are admitted to it, that, if
they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that degree, they could
&s;carce need means of improvement. And, on the
other hand, it is wrong to receive tho&s;e who can
evidently exert no good affections in it, and there|fore
cannot be improved by the u&s;e of it. A mi|ni&s;ter,
by con&s;idering i$ in this light, and regu|lating
his conduct by this view of it, may take
&s;everal advantages from this &s;acrament for making
good impre&s;&s;ions on the people. Thus, about the
time of a communion, every mini&s;ter that knows
<PB N="381" REF="388">
any one of his pari&s;h guilty of eminent &s;ins, may
go to him, and admoni&s;h him to change his cour&s;e
of life, or not to profane the table of the Lord.
When a per&s;on de&s;igns fir&s;t to partake in the
Lord's Supper, a mini&s;ter may make good im|pre&s;&s;ions
on the per&s;on him&s;elf and on others, by
making him not only in private, but in as public
a manner as he finds it convenient to u&s;e, to make
&s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of his embracing the Chri&s;tian$
faith for him&s;elf, and to vow that he will live &s;uit|ably
to it, renouncing the &s;ins which he has for|merly
indulged, and promi&s;ing to live henceforth
as becomes a Chri&s;tian. This is practi&s;ed by &s;ome
mini&s;ters with good &s;ucce&s;s, and with a very great
effect.</P>
<P>When the actual di&s;pen&s;ing of this &s;acrament comes
on, the fir&s;t part of the &s;ervice is, what is called
fencing the tables; that is, de&s;cribing tho&s;e who are
unfit for this part of wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e who are
fit. In doing this, care &s;hould be taken to require
no qualifications which are not ab&s;olutely required
by the &s;criptures. All unbelievers and all wicked
per&s;ons &s;hould be declared unworthy; but no
mini&s;ter, except he can &s;how a revelation from
Heaven, declaring his explications of &s;cripture to
be infallibly true, has a right to declare any per&s;on
unworthy on account of &s;uch errors in judgement as
are con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;incere belief of Chri&s;tianity.
This in&s;titution is the te&s;t of Chri&s;tians, not of any
<PB N="382" REF="389">
one &s;ect; it is the bond of Chri&s;tian love, not of
divi&s;ion and &s;chi&s;m.</P>
<P>Again, a mini&s;ter &s;hould warn them who are
unworthy, in &s;uch a manner as may &s;how, in the
mo&s;t obvious way, that his warnings are not arbi|trary,
that he does not merely &s;peak from his own
opinion or humour; in &s;uch a manner as may
carry conviction with it, that the &s;everal characters
which he de&s;cribes do nece&s;&s;arily, in their very
nature, render per&s;ons unfit for this act of wor&s;hip.
The ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t effectual way of an&s;wering
this end &s;eems to be, along with every character
that is de&s;cribed, to point the rea&s;on why, or to
expre&s;s in what manner, it renders tho&s;e to whom
it belongs unworthy. Thus, in general, the nece&s;|&s;ity
of &s;ome preparation and previous good di&s;po|&s;ition
of heart ari&s;es from this, that external acts
of wor&s;hip can improve the temper only by their
being exertions of the good affections from which
they proceed, and therefore cannot at all improve
tho&s;e who have not &s;ome degree of the&s;e affections,
and of con&s;equence cannot exert them, or put
them in exerci&s;e; and the matter may be repre|&s;ented
in this light by the mini&s;ter. When athei&s;ts
are excluded, the obvious rea&s;on may be hinted,
that they cannot join in an act of religious wor&s;hip;
when dei&s;ts, that they cannot join in a chri&s;tian
in&s;titution. When the vices forbidden in the third
commandment are mentioned, it may be hinted
<PB N="383" REF="390">
that they are incon&s;i&s;tent with that reverence of
God which &s;uits &s;o &s;olemn an approach to him.
The vices forbidden in the fourth commandment
&s;how a want or a weakne&s;s of devout affections,
and therefore unfit men for this in&s;titution, in
which devout affections &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the
highe&s;t pitch of fervency; and &s;o in other in&s;tances.
Proceeding in this way will give great weight to
all that a mini&s;ter &s;ays in this part of the &s;ervice,
will render it convincing, and keep it from being
in any mea&s;ure regarded as a mere form.</P>
<P>In declaring who are fit for this act of wor&s;hip,
a mini&s;ter's view &s;hould be, not only to declare, in
as plain terms as po&s;&s;ible, what are the characters
that render one a good man and a true Chri&s;tian,
or at lea&s;t, in &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of repentance as
will render this act of wor&s;hip acceptable, but al&s;o
to remove the grounds of fear which weak or
melancholy per&s;ons are apt to dwell upon, from
reflection on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of their minds,
their want of warmth of devotion, their being
di&s;tracted with idle thoughts, or their not having
found time for &s;uch particular preparation as they
would have cho&s;en.</P>
<P>As the whole office of a clergyman is properly
mini&s;terial, not lordly or dictatorial, &s;o in this &s;er|vice
in particular, it &s;eems to be more &s;uitable to
this character of his office to expre&s;s his warnings
as declarations of the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications of
<PB N="384" REF="391">
communicants, by which they may examine and
judge them&s;elves, than to affect the authority and
&s;olemnity which are &s;ometimes u&s;ed, of repeating
continually, &startq;I debar and exclude,&endq; or &startq;I invite
in the name of Chri&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>After this part of the &s;ervice is over, as this
&s;acrament is a po&s;itive in&s;titution, not of natural
obligation, but deriving its obligation &s;olely from
its being appointed in &s;cripture, the in&s;titution
&s;hould be read from &s;ome of the places of &s;cripture
where it is recorded. The reading of it &s;hould be
followed by prayer, which will properly con&s;i&s;t of
two parts, thank&s;giving for the ble&s;&s;ings of the
go&s;pel, and petitions for God's ble&s;&s;ing on the
in&s;titution, for his grace to excite and enliven all
the devout affections which &s;hould be exerted in
it, and for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to perform our vows,
and practi&s;e all the duties of life to which they
bind us. This prayer, which &s;hould be contrived,
as much as po&s;&s;ible, to expre&s;s and excite &s;incere
and &s;ervent devotion, may be very properly followed
by giving &s;uch a view of the nature of the in&s;titu|tion,
as may di&s;po&s;e both to a rational and to a
devout ob&s;ervance of it.</P>
<P>After this is over, it would be extremely decent,
that, except the mini&s;ter's di&s;tributing the elements
with the words u&s;ed by our Saviour, all the re&s;t
were performed in &s;olemn &s;ilence. And this is, in
fact, the method pre&s;cribed by our directory.
<PB N="385" REF="392">
But cu&s;tom has introduced di&s;cour&s;es at every
table. The&s;e are attended with this inconvenience,
that they employ the communicants too much in
hearing, and divert them from what is their proper
bu&s;ine&s;s, internal devotion. Since they are u&s;ed
they ought therefore at lea&s;t to be contrived &s;o as
to produce this inconvenience as little as po&s;&s;ible.
Set di&s;cour&s;es, calculated for information, are
always improper. The part of the di&s;cour&s;e which
precedes the di&s;tribution of the elements &s;hould be
employed in giving &s;ome &s;triking view of the love
of God in Chri&s;t, tending directly to inflame the
affections which ought to be exerci&s;ed. The di&s;|cour&s;e
&s;hould not be continued after the elements
are received; the mini&s;ter &s;hould either pre&s;erve
ab&s;olute &s;ilence, or throw in only &s;uch &s;hort hints
as may direct and animate the devotion of the
communicants; any thing further interrupts en|tirely
the exerci&s;e of devotion, which &s;hould
employ them. The remaining part of the di&s;|cour&s;e
will be properly employed in &s;uch warm
exhortations, &s;triking &s;entiments, and practical
maxims and directions, as may make an impre&s;|&s;ion
on them, and influence their conduct.</P>
<P>After all have communicated, there generally is,
and very properly may be, an addre&s;s or exhort|ation.
For this, there are &s;everal very &s;it topics.
The mo&s;t common way is to give a de&s;cription
of the different characters of communicants, by
which they may know how far their temper has
<PB N="386" REF="393">
been right or faulty, and exhortations &s;uited to
the variety of their tempers. And if this be done
with judgement, and with a fixed view to habitual
practice, it may be very u&s;eful. Another proper
topic may be, to rectify men's mi&s;takes about the
advantages to be expected from this &s;acrament,
in immediate and &s;en&s;ible illuminations or con&s;o|lations,
to direct them to judge of their advantage
by their after-conduct, and to improve their com|munication
by a holy life. Or a mini&s;ter may
urge upon them the obligations which Chri&s;tianity,
and particularly which this public profe&s;&s;ion of
it, lays them under, to virtue and holine&s;s. In a
word, whatever has a tendency either to per&s;uade
or to direct them to a becoming conduct, is a very
proper topic.</P>
<P>In general, great care is nece&s;&s;ary in every thing
that is &s;aid about this &s;acrament, to avoid my&s;tical
and unmeaning expre&s;&s;ions, to u&s;e no word which
does not convey a di&s;tinct and rational conception,
and to direct the whole to practice. Mo&s;t men's
minds are, at this time, peculiarly &s;u&s;ceptible of
good impre&s;&s;ions; and a mini&s;ter &s;hould &s;eize this
favourable opportunity of fixing in them &s;omething
practical, &s;omething moral, &s;omething fit to enter
into their temper, and regulate their life.</P>
<P>As to the wor&s;hip of God on extraordinary occa|&s;ions,
we have already taken &s;ome notice of the
peculiarities of &s;ermons &s;uited to them. And,
<PB N="387" REF="394">
with regard to conducting public devotion on them,
it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ubject of
the devotion &s;hould be &s;uited to the particular
occa&s;ion; that for this end, the greate&s;t propor|tion
of time &s;hould be allowed to that part of devo|tion
which mo&s;t &s;uits the occa&s;ion; as to confe&s;&s;ion
on fa&s;ts, to prai&s;e on thank&s;givings; and that, in
general, it may be proper to &s;pend more time in
devotion than on ordinary occa&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Duties re&s;pecting the Church in
general.</HEAD>
<P>THE public duties of the pa&s;toral office, which
have been hitherto con&s;idered, are incumbent
on a mini&s;ter as pa&s;tor of a particular pari&s;h, and
regard all the congregation under his care. But,
be&s;ides the&s;e, there are other duties of a &s;till more
public nature, which are incumbent on him as
a member of the church in general, and which
do not immediately or nece&s;&s;arily re&s;pect the pari&s;h
committed to his care. The&s;e we &s;hall briefly
con&s;ider.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin with a part of the pa&s;toral
office, which is indeed often exerci&s;ed by a mini&s;ter
in his own pari&s;h, but which we have cho&s;en to
con&s;ider under this head, becau&s;e it is often al&s;o
exerci&s;ed by him in a more public capacity, and
without any immediate reference to his own pari&s;h,
and becau&s;e it bears &s;ome relation to the other
duties which regard the government of the church;
I mean the exerci&s;e of public di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>We have already con&s;idered the &s;everal private
ways of checking or rebuking wickedne&s;s, which
<PB N="389" REF="396">
a mini&s;ter may, and ought to u&s;e. But private
rebukes are not &s;ufficient in all ca&s;es; the apo&s;tle
Paul expre&s;sly commands Timothy, in &s;ome ca&s;es,
to &startq;rebuke them that &s;in before all, that others
al&s;o may fear<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 20.</NOTE>.&endq; And our Saviour directs our
conduct in this matter: &startq;If thy brother &s;hall
tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault
between thee and him alone: if he &s;hall hear
thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother. But if he
will not hear thee, then take with thee one or
two more, that in the mouth of two or three
witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And
if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
church: but if he neglect to hear the church,
let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a
publican<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 15, &amp;.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ages of the church, the di&s;cipline
was extremely &s;trict, much &s;tricter than the temper
of the pre&s;ent age will permit. And though the
greate&s;t care &s;hould be taken not to &s;lacken di&s;ci|pline
more than ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity requires, yet
prudence forbids to &s;tretch it farther than the
&s;ituation of things will bear; for attempts to do &s;o,
by proving ineffectual, will di&s;appoint their own
de&s;ign, and make the &s;piritual arms of the church
even more de&s;pi&s;ed than they were before.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="397">
Every thing e&s;&s;ential to the manner of exer|ci&s;ing
di&s;cipline is pre&s;cribed in the form of proce&s;s
e&s;tabli&s;hed by authority, which is compo&s;ed with a
&s;pirit of moderation and good &s;en&s;e perfectly incon|&s;i&s;tent
with that inqui&s;itorial &s;pirit which &s;ome are
di&s;po&s;ed to exert in di&s;cipline. An acquaintance
with the rules which are there pre&s;cribed is ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary for every mini&s;ter, in order to
&s;ecure him from blunders in appointing cen&s;ures.
And the rules of procedure being there fully laid
down, renders it only nece&s;&s;ary here to make a
few general ob&s;ervations, which may be of u&s;e for
directing you to apply the rules with prudence and
judgement.</P>
<P>All &s;ins require repentance, and repentance will
always &s;how it&s;elf by obvious and open effects;
but all &s;ins are not the proper objects of church
di&s;cipline. Chri&s;tian charity will not allow us to
pry into the &s;ecret faults of others; it is only their
open and public &s;ins that give &s;candal, and de&s;erve
public animadver&s;ions. All open and public &s;ins
are in them&s;elves proper objects of di&s;cipline; yet
all of them cannot be ea&s;ily brought under di&s;ci|pline.
Some of them do not &s;how them&s;elves by
overt and determinate acts; they do not admit of
definite mea&s;ures. It is not ea&s;y to fix the limits
where the lawful ends and the unlawful begins.
On this account they cannot ea&s;ily be cen&s;ured
publicly, for it is not ea&s;y to prove that per&s;ons
are guilty of them; and to inflict cen&s;ures in ca&s;es
<PB N="391" REF="398">
which do not admit determinate and &s;atisfactory
proof, would open a door to tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion.
For the &s;ame rea&s;on, many vices which
di&s;play them&s;elves in determinate and overt acts,
cannot, in all ca&s;es, be ea&s;ily &s;ubjected to public
cen&s;ure, becau&s;e they cannot be fully proved.
The&s;e cau&s;es have reduced the vices which are now
publicly cen&s;ured to a very narrow compa&s;s, to
&s;uch as di&s;cover them&s;elves by effects perfectly un|que&s;tionable
and free from all ambiguity. Yet
even the&s;e are more than are generally &s;ubjected to
the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline, as &s;wearing, &s;ome in|&s;tances
of drunkenne&s;s, many ca&s;es of lying, di&s;|hone&s;ty,
and calumny, and many overt acts of
impiety. All &s;uch &s;ins, which are both open and
capable of legal proof, ought, doubtle&s;s, to be
much more &s;ubjected to di&s;cipline than they are,
for they are properly &s;candalous. But it will not
be prudent to attempt the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipiine
again&s;t &s;ins, to which the&s;e characters do not agree.
In ages when a &s;en&s;e of religion prevails, they who
have fallen into &s;in may, from a true di&s;po&s;ition
of penitence, be ready to acknowlege it when they
are accu&s;ed, and to make all the reparation in
their power for the &s;candal they have given. But
that is not the temper of the pre&s;ent age; men
will acknowlege nothing which cannot be proved
again&s;t them. In this &s;itua$inn, all that can be
done is to extend the exerci&s;e of church di&s;cipline
uniformly again&s;t tho&s;e &s;ins which can be clearly
<PB N="392" REF="399">
proved, and to attempt only private admonitions
or reproo&s;s again&s;t other &s;ins.</P>
<P>The abu&s;es of the Popi&s;h church have intro|duced
an inveterate and deep-rooted mi&s;take,
which it will not be ea&s;y to eradicate, that &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to church cen&s;ures is a &s;ort of penance
which expiates the guilt of the &s;in. All methods
&s;hould be taken to remove this error, and to in|culcate
that they are only &s;piritual cha&s;ti&s;ements
de&s;igned to increa&s;e true repentance, and to ex|pre&s;s
it, and that no farther than they do &s;o, can
they be of any avail for obtaining pardon. In
inflicting cen&s;ures, a mini&s;ter &s;hould carefully re|member
that he is a judge, and &s;hould therefore
pre&s;erve perfect impartiality and &s;trict ju&s;tice. It
is particularly ba&s;e to make the power entru&s;ted
to him in any degree an in&s;trument of his own re|&s;entment.
If he bear any grudge at a per&s;on
who&s;e conduct expo&s;es him to public cen&s;ure, it
would be much better to decline, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble,
any &s;hare in judging of it, in order to avoid
even the &s;u&s;picion of partiality. All di&s;cipline
ought to be managed in &s;uch a way as may tend
mo&s;t to promote true virtue; and in order to this,
it &s;hould always be directed by prudence, joined
with a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>In almo&s;t all the public duties which are incum|bent
on a clergyman as a member of the church
<PB N="393" REF="400">
in general, he acts the part of a judge, and there|fore
ought to be careful to maintain the character
of a judge, the peculiar decorum of which is &s;trict
and inflexible integrity. Here indeed, all extremes
are to be avoided. We mu&s;t not, by &s;tudying to
be impartial, become rigid or &s;evere; nor, in
avoiding rigour, ought we to &s;werve from inte|grity.
We mu&s;t be &s;trict, yet not captious; un|bia&s;&s;ed,
yet not rigorous; meek, yet not remi&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of judgement which principally
come before mini&s;ters as members of judicatories,
(be&s;ides ca&s;es of di&s;cipline,) are two; the deci&s;ion
of &s;ettlements, and the qualifications of candidates
for the mini&s;try. It will not be improper to
make a few ob&s;ervations on the&s;e &s;eparately,
becau&s;e there are &s;ome circum&s;tances peculiar to
each.</P>
<P>In que&s;tions concerning &s;ettlements, the property
and rights of men are as truly concerned, as in any
que&s;tions that are brought before a civil judge.
An hone&s;t man can have no more &s;cope for favour
in ca&s;es of this &s;ort, than a civil judge can have in
trials for life and property. It cannot fail to be a
great reproach to a clergyman to be thought more
open to &s;olicitations than any other judge. Yet it
has &s;omehow happened, that they who would never
think of &s;oliciting a civil judge in a cau&s;e depending
before him, make no &s;cruple to &s;olicit clergymen
with regard to cau&s;es depending before church
<PB N="394" REF="401">
judicatories, and imagine they have a right to be
offended with a per&s;on, and to re&s;ent it, if he
refu&s;e to give his voice as they require. Clergy-men
have given too great countenance to this
&s;hameful practice, by li&s;tening to &s;olicitations, by
yielding to them, by not expre&s;&s;ing &s;ufficient indig|nation
again&s;t them, by not remembering that it is
incumbent on them to &s;u&s;tain the integrity and
inflexibility of the judge. One circum&s;tance has
greatly contributed to this; the laws of the church
regarding &s;ettlements have &s;carcely ever been fixed
and determinate; and this has led not only clergymen,
but all others concerned in church judicatories,
to a&s;&s;ume a liberty, and to think that they
might allow them&s;elves a great latitude in determining
according to circum&s;tances in any particular
ca&s;e; and partiality or attachment ea&s;ily made them
conceive circum&s;tances in the mo&s;t favourable
light for that &s;ide which they were di&s;po&s;ed to
e&s;pou&s;e. This cannot excu&s;e the conduct; for
the a&s;&s;uming this liberty evidently tended to make
every thing loo&s;e and uncertain; and it is reproachful
to any court to be guided by no fixed principles.
In this &s;ituation, it was plainly incumbent
on every clergyman to lay down a &s;ettled rule of
judgement for him&s;elf, and to adhere to it uni|formly
till he found a better, for which he might
exchange it in all ca&s;es. He ought not to hearken
to &s;olicitations; if they are made by per&s;ons to
whom he lies under obligations, he may profe&s;s
his readine&s;s to oblige them in every way in his
<PB N="395" REF="402">
power, but at the &s;ame time tell them re&s;olutely,
that in que&s;tions before a judicatory he con&s;iders
him&s;elf as a judge, and mu&s;t be determined &s;olely
by the merits of the cau&s;e. By whom&s;oever he
be &s;olicited, he may declare his readine&s;s to receive
information of any facts on which the cau&s;e
depends, but expre&s;s a firm re&s;olution to li&s;ten to
nothing el&s;e, and an hone&s;t indignation at the &s;u&s;|picion
of his being capable of partiality or corrup|tion.
This is the conduct which integrity dictates,
and which is nece&s;&s;ary for keeping a good con|&s;cience.
This is the conduct which will redound
to the honour of the whole order; it is indeed
nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving it from reproach or con|tempt.
And this conduct will mo&s;t effectually
&s;ecure a man's own ea&s;e and independence; for if
it be once known that this is a man's fixed deter|mination,
he will meet with no importunities; and
if he adhere to it uniformly and &s;acredly, no per|&s;on
will think that he has a title to be offended,
on whichever &s;ide he gives his judgement; he will
not only pre&s;erve more general e&s;teem, but will run
le&s;s ri&s;k of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of individuals,
than they who are more open to influence, who
therefore offend in every in&s;tance where they do
not hearken to it, and who are often reduced to
&s;ituations in which they mu&s;t incur the di&s;plea&s;ure
of &s;ome one of the contending parties.</P>
<P>The other great &s;ubject of judging, about which
a clergyman has occa&s;ion to be conver&s;ant, is the
<PB N="396" REF="403">
qualifications of candidates for the mini&s;try. This
is evidently a duty of great importance. Nothing
can have a nearer connection with the prevalence
or the decline of religion and virtue, than the
abilities and manners of the clergy. The greate&s;t
care is therefore incumbent on tho&s;e on whom the
choice of them depends. A mini&s;ter ought to take
all the pains he can, to learn the true character of
tho&s;e who are propo&s;ed for this office; and if he be
not fully &s;atisfied, either by his per&s;onal knowlege,
or by the information of tho&s;e who have per&s;onal
knowlege, that they are, in re&s;pect both of under&s;tanding
and morals, really qualified for this office,
he &s;hould not be prevailed on, by friend&s;hip, or
attachment, or compa&s;&s;ion, or any &s;ort of influence,
to concur in bringing them into this important
office. It is an exhortation of the apo&s;tle Paul,
&startq;Lay hands &s;uddenly on no man, neither be par|taker
of other men's &s;ins<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 22.</NOTE>.&endq; To do it &s;uddenly,
is to do it without a &s;trict and accurate inquiry into
a man's real character; and by doing it thus &s;ud|denly,
men in &s;ome mea&s;ure incur a &s;hare in the
guilt of the unworthy per&s;on to who&s;e promotion
they contribute. This is, in general, very little
attended to; but every clergyman ought to charge
his con&s;cience, in a deep and particular manner,
not to contribute to bring any per&s;on into the
mini&s;try, if he have any rea&s;on to think that his
<PB N="397" REF="404">
abilities are not &s;uch as may rai&s;e him above con|tempt,
and render him really u&s;eful, or that his
life is not &s;o regular, and his temper &s;o virtuous,
as to make him fit to be put in holy orders. This
will be particularly incumbent on a clergyman in
pre&s;byteries, where motions for licen&s;ing take their
fir&s;t ri&s;e; for there one has the be&s;t opportunities
for information; and &s;uperior judicatories are often
obliged to take things for granted on the inform|ation
of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er courts, to whom it is &s;uppo&s;ed
a per&s;on propo&s;ed is fully known. Both intel|lectual
and moral qualifications ought to be re|garded;
but the latter are of much greater con&s;e|quence
than the former. In &s;ome &s;ituations, a
moderate degree of the former will be &s;ufficient;
but in any po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation a &s;en&s;ible defect of the
latter cannot fail to produce the wor&s;t con&s;equences,
with re&s;pect both to the u&s;efulne&s;s of the mini&s;ter,
and the general intere&s;ts of religion. Were clergy|men
as careful in this part of their duty as they
ought to be, it would in a great mea&s;ure prevent
all the inconveniencies which could be appre|hended
from any particular method of &s;ettling
pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters, as members of church courts, have
not only a power of judging, but likewi&s;e a fort of
legi&s;lative authority. All the fundamental laws of
religion are contained in the &s;criptures; tho&s;e of
particular c&s;tabli&s;hments or forms of religion are
fixed by the original con&s;titution of particular
<PB N="398" REF="405">
churches: but there is a nece&s;&s;ity for additional
laws on account of particular emergencies and
changes of circum&s;tances. The&s;e ought always
to be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;cripture; they ought to pre|&s;cribe
the be&s;t means of an&s;wering the ends of re|ligion,
in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and according to
the particular circum&s;tances which take place. In
eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as well as in all other matters, the
true &s;pirit of a legi&s;lator is the &s;pirit of moderation,
di&s;po&s;ing to avoid all extremes. Care &s;hould be
taken that laws which are made really tend to an&s;wer
the end for which they are made; for it is no un|common
thing for legi&s;lators to under&s;tand &s;o little
the nature of &s;ome laws, that by &s;ome of their
con&s;equences they ob&s;truct the very ends for which
they were de&s;igned, and which, con&s;idered in one
light, they appeared fit to promote. All ambiguity,
ob&s;curity, and confu&s;ion, ought to be avoided in
making laws; for it will prove a &s;ource of endle&s;s
que&s;tions and cavil, and an occa&s;ion of arbitrary
&s;entences, when the laws come to be executed.
No u&s;ele&s;s laws &s;hould be made, for they always
weaken &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary. A law &s;hould al|ways
be framed &s;o that it may not be ea&s;ily eluded,
for when it can, it never fails to detract from the
authority by which it was enacted. Penal laws
in matters of religion and &s;peculative opinions are
always pernicious; as the clergy cannot enact
them by their own authority, they &s;hould never
wi&s;h to &s;ee them enacted by the civil power. If
they be executed, they only de&s;troy mankind; if
<PB N="399" REF="406">
they be not executed, they &s;how the impotence of
tho&s;e by whom they were enacted.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to me to be more of a moral obli|gation
on clergymen to attend judicatories of which
they are members, than is commonly apprehended.
Many things may be done by a few, reflecting di&s;|honour
on the whole body, which the pre&s;ence
and influence of others might have prevented. In
this ca&s;e, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ee how one who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s
it was to have been pre&s;ent, can excu&s;e him&s;elf
to his own con&s;cience, if he neglected attendance
without good rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the con&s;ideration of the duties
of the pa&s;toral office, with a few ob&s;ervations con|cerning
the behaviour of a clergyman to his bre|thren
of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion. God has wi&s;ely
con&s;tituted human nature in &s;uch a way, that re|lation
of any kind excites a peculiar degree of love
and benevolence. This con&s;titution of nature
leads men to love tho&s;e of their own profe&s;&s;ion,
and to be concerned for the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety
to which they belong. It is acknowleged that the
profe&s;&s;ion of clergymen unites them by as clo&s;e
ties, as any other profe&s;&s;ion does tho&s;e who exer|ci&s;e
it. By this means, it demands a great degree
of benevolence from clergymen to one another.
This benevolence &s;hould exert it&s;elf in urging cler|gymen
to be peculiarly ready to do tho&s;e good
offices to one another which they owe to men in
<PB N="400" REF="407">
general. They &s;hould be warmly intere&s;ted in the
concerns, and &s;olicitous for the pro&s;perity of each
other. Notwith&s;tanding the great degree of equa|lity
which is e&s;tabli&s;hed among mini&s;ters by the
con&s;titution of our church, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
ari&s;e &s;ome difference in the circum&s;tances of cler|gymen,
from their &s;ituation, their demands, and
their advantages or di&s;advantages; and from the
very nature of man, and the greater or le&s;s oppor|tunities
of men, there will be differences with re|gard
to prudence, learning, and abilities. That
benevolence which men of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion owe
to one another, obliges tho&s;e clergymen who have,
in any re&s;pects, the advantage of their brethren,
to be &s;o far from de&s;pi&s;ing them becau&s;e they are
not &s;o happily &s;ituated, as, on the contrary, to do
all they can to a&s;&s;i&s;t and encourage them. Bene|volence
to the clergy as belonging to our own pro|fe&s;&s;ion
will very naturally exert it&s;elf in a love of
their company, which will produce not only the
&s;everal exerci&s;es of ho&s;pitality towards them, when
they fall in the way, but likewi&s;e a de&s;ire to con|trive
being in their company, and maintaining a
friendly corre&s;pondence with them. Nothing can
be more improving than clergymen's being fre|quently
together, e&s;pecially if, either when they are
accidentally in company, or in meetings concerted
on purpo&s;e, they would promote the knowlege,
and give advice in the affairs of one another, and
contrive the propere&s;t means of promoting the in|tere&s;ts
of religion and virtue. &startq;Hereby they
<PB N="401" REF="408">
would be cemented into one body; they might
under&s;tand what were ami&s;s in each other's con|duct,
and try to correct it by prudent advices. It
is a fal&s;e pity in any of the clergy, to &s;ee their
brethren running into ill cour&s;es without giving
them warning; it is a real cruelty to the church,
and may prove a cruelty to the per&s;on him&s;elf;
for things may be more ea&s;ily corrected at fir&s;t,
before they have grown to be public, or are
hardened by habit and cu&s;tom.&endq; A due degree
of that benevolence which clergymen owe to one
another as members of the &s;ame body, e&s;pecially
if it be joined with a &s;incere regard to the intere&s;ts
of religion, the good cau&s;e in which all are en|gaged
will effectually extingui&s;h tho&s;e little rival|&s;hips
about popularity or the like, which create
grudges, animo&s;ities, and divi&s;ions, and turn off
men's attention from what is e&s;&s;ential in religion,
to things which are at mo&s;t but appendages of it.
Benevolence will likewi&s;e produce moderation to|wards
one another on account of difference of &s;en|timents
and opinions, which cannot fail to ari&s;e
among fallible men. The clergy will naturally
have peculiar occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e this virtue to|wards
one another, becau&s;e their &s;tudies are, more
than tho&s;e of other men, confined to matters $word$
religion, and &s;o will mo&s;t readily give ri&s;e to a va|riety
of opinions; and likewi&s;e, becau&s;e they have
peculiar opportunities of knowing each other's
&s;entiments. &startq;Now, it is by con&s;idering our
brethren in the &s;everal endearing views in which
<PB N="402" REF="409">
benevolence will repre&s;ent them, that we &s;hall
feel our&s;elves,&endq; to u&s;e the words of an excellent
writer, &startq;in&s;pired with the principles of true
Chri&s;tian moderation. When we ob&s;erve others
differing from us in opinion about le&s;&s;er points,
or even, as it appears to us, erring from the
truth in more important matters, it will imme|diately
occur to us, that we are all in a &s;tate of
much darkne&s;s, and equally liable to mi&s;takes
and errors. Real love, and affectionate &s;ym|pathy,
and ju&s;t views of human nature, will lead
us to reflect on all that va&s;t variety of circum|&s;tances
which may prevail on hone&s;t and worthy
minds to embrace opinions widely different from
tho&s;e which we reckon true.&endq; The&s;e are &s;ome
of the principal duties which clergymen owe to
one another, which are all natural exertions and
effects of the peculiar degree of benevolence which
their being of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion tends to pro|duce.</P>
<P>All the duties which we have enumerated are
incumbent on every clergyman; and all the&s;e
together are certainly &s;ufficient to occupy the
whole man, to engage all his attention, and to
employ all his time. Yet he cannot, with a good
con&s;cience, neglect any of them: he mu&s;t devote
him&s;elf to them: he mu&s;t not &s;atisfy him&s;elf with
performing them in any way, but mu&s;t be always
&s;olicitous to perform them in the be&s;t way, and
mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in performing them with greater and
<PB N="403" REF="410">
greater care and prudence, till they really an&s;wer
their de&s;ign in a thorough reformation of the
people. This di&s;play of the duties of the pa&s;toral
office fully ju&s;tifies the view of its importance
and difficulty with which we &s;et out, and even
&s;hews that the highe&s;t picture of its importance
and difficulty which can be drawn in general
terms, falls far &s;hort of the truth. Every &s;ingle
duty almo&s;t belonging to this office requires the
exertion of all the powers of human nature; but
all its duties together &s;eem to require more than
human abilities. A mini&s;ter is engaged to pro|mote
the mo&s;t important of all ends, the im|provement
and &s;alvation of mankind; the failure
of which is nece&s;&s;arily attended with everla&s;ting
con&s;equences of dread and horror; and nothing
but unwearied a&s;&s;iduity in the di&s;charge of nume|rous
duties, which will occupy every part of
his time, and which it is not ea&s;y to di&s;charge
aright, can prevent a clergyman's being account|able
for the&s;e con&s;equences. A ju&s;t conception
of the duties of the pa&s;toral office mu&s;t produce
a vigorous &s;en&s;e of its moment and difficulty;
and this &s;en&s;e mu&s;t excite all who aim at the
office to the greate&s;t care in fitting them&s;elves
for it, and po&s;&s;e&s;s them with the deepe&s;t &s;olicitude
that they may not be unworthy. The fir&s;t &s;tep
to their being fit is to know what are the qualifi|cations
requi&s;ite, and by what preparation they
may be obtained. Some ob&s;ervations on this &s;ub|ject
will complete our view of the pa&s;toral care.</P>

the con&s;ideration of the duties which belong to
that office; for they will include every thing that
is nece&s;&s;ary for the proper performance of the&s;e
&s;everal duties. In deducing them we &s;hall &s;tudy

<PB N="405" REF="412">
and &s;et in different &s;triking lights by many
who have treated of the mini&s;terial character.</P>
<P>The qualifications which are of importance to a
clergyman are partly natural, and partly acquired.
It is not unnece&s;&s;ary to take notice of the former,
becau&s;e, though they are not in our power, yet the
want of them &s;hows that a man was never de&s;igned
for this difficult profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;hould determine
him, or tho&s;e at who&s;e di&s;po&s;al he is, to make
choice of &s;ome other occupation, for which &s;o
great talents are not requi&s;ite, and in which he
may &s;ucceed better.</P>
<P>A clear and &s;ound under&s;tanding and good
&s;en&s;e are gifts of nature ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a
per&s;on who intends to be a clergyman. They are
nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring the knowlege which his
profe&s;&s;ion demands. They are nece&s;&s;ary for apply|ing
this knowlege in the &s;everal ways of in&s;truction,
as occa&s;ion requires. They are nece&s;&s;ary for en|abling
him to avoid tho&s;e errors and imprudences
both in teaching and in living, which would ob|&s;truct
the end of his function and the &s;ucce&s;s of

<P>A &s;trong and firm memory is likewi&s;e a talent
of great advantage to a clergyman. Memory is
nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring the knowlege which &s;uits
his profe&s;&s;ion. If it be remarkably defective, the
greate&s;t application to thought or reading will be

in&s;ufficient to furni&s;h him with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tock
of knowlege.</P>
<P>A warm, lively, and &s;trong imagination is highly
u&s;eful to a clergyman. It gives him a readine&s;s in
applying what he knows, with propriety, to par|ticular
occa&s;ions which occur. It gives a great
advantage for the compo&s;ition of public di&s;cour&s;es,
and enables him to &s;et every &s;entiment in a &s;triking
light. It adds an ornament to all the knowlege
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and enables him to apply it to
u&s;e with the greate&s;t lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The&s;e are intellectual talents derived from Nature,
which the occupation of a clergyman demands.
When Nature has denied the&s;e, it points out that
a man was not de&s;igned for this profe&s;&s;ion, as much
as its denying a man the bodily &s;trength which is
requi&s;ite for any &s;evere employment &s;hows that he
was not de&s;igned for that employment and that
he ought not to make choice of it.</P>
<P>There are other intellectual qualifications nece&s;|&s;ary
for the mini&s;terial office, which may be ac|quired
by tho&s;e who are not defective in the natural
talents already mentioned, and which all who make
choice of this profe&s;&s;ion ought to be careful to
acquire. Knowlege is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a
teacher. If it be a&s;ked, what kind of knowlege?
we may an&s;wer, that no part of real knowlege is
u&s;ele&s;s or &s;uperfluous. It is proper, however, not
<PB N="407" REF="414">
to repre&s;ent the nece&s;&s;ary knowlege as too exten&s;ive,
le&s;t the view of its extent &s;hould di&s;courage the
diffident from attempting this profe&s;&s;ion; or le&s;t
&s;olicitude to acquire all parts of it &s;hould confound
our &s;tudies, and render us &s;uperficial in every part.
But all the knowlege which is &s;trictly connected
with the &s;ubject of a mini&s;ter's teaching is certainly
indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o that no per&s;on who
has not a competent mea&s;ure of it can be qualified
for the mini&s;terial office.</P>
<P>A competent knowlege of the original languages
in which the in&s;pired writers deliver them&s;elves,
and of the hi&s;tory, antiquities, and cu&s;toms of the
ages and nations in which they lived, or to which
they allude, is nece&s;&s;ary for enabling us to find out
the true &s;en&s;e of the &s;criptures, and to illu&s;trate
them in a ju&s;t and clear manner; and this is the
bu&s;ine&s;s of every clergyman.</P>
<P>An acquaintance with the rules of right rea&s;on|ing
is nece&s;&s;ary for enabling us to argue conclu&s;ively
and with &s;trength, both in private and in public;
for qualifying us for detecting the &s;ophi&s;ms, and
an&s;wering the cavils of the enemies of our holy
religion; and for defending either the whole or
particular parts of it again&s;t their attacks.</P>
<P>A clergyman mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s that knowlege of
human nature which may &s;how him the be&s;t and
<PB N="408" REF="415">
mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful methods of addre&s;&s;ing men, of
informing their minds, or influencing their hearts.</P>
<P>Without &s;uch a knowlege of human life and
of the world as may make him in &s;ome mea&s;ure a
judge of the characters of men, he cannot advi&s;e
or reprove them in a proper way, nor execute
any of the duties of his office prudently, with a
due regard to place, time, per&s;ons, and other
circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The knowlege of natural religion and morality
is &s;till more nearly connected with the pa&s;toral
office. Natural religion is the foundation of
revealed; its principles and the duties of morality
are all adapted, illu&s;trated, and improved in the
Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. Acquaintance with the&s;e will
furni&s;h him with materials for all the functions of
his office.</P>
<P>The knowlege of the evidences of revealed
religion is nece&s;&s;ary, both for e&s;tabli&s;hing his own
faith on a rational foundation, and for enabling
him to guard others again&s;t the attacks of unbe|lievers.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures are the proper &s;tudy of a clergy|man;
they are the fountains from which his in&s;truc|tions
are chiefly to be drawn; the knowlege of
them is requi&s;ite for the di&s;charge of every part of
<PB N="409" REF="416">
his duty. He &s;hould under&s;tand not only the
meaning of them critically, &s;o as to be able to
perceive it on con&s;ulting them; but he &s;hould have
&s;uch an acquaintance with them, as to be able to
recollect and apply many pa&s;&s;ages of them as
occa&s;ion requires.</P>
<P>A knowlege of the &s;everal doctrines and duties
contained in the &s;criptures, in their proper order
and dependence; a knowlege of the different opi|nions
which have been entertained by different
&s;ects of Chri&s;tians; and a knowlege of the hi&s;tory of
the &s;everal revolutions of religion and the Chri&s;tian
church, will be highly &s;erviceable to a clergyman
on many different occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>A collection of ju&s;t and &s;triking &s;entiments on
religious and moral &s;ubjects, and of examples
from &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, trea&s;ured in the
memory, and rendered familiar by frequent
thought and meditation, will enable a mini&s;ter to
perform all the kinds of teaching incumbent on
him with readine&s;s and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A knowlege of the principles and rules of com|po&s;ition,
and good ta&s;te, formed by the &s;tudy of
the&s;e, and by an intimate acquaintance with the
be&s;t writers of every kind, is nece&s;&s;ary for enabling
a clergyman to acquit him&s;elf properly in his
public performances.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="417">
We may add, though it will perhaps appear
trivial, that a propriety, ju&s;tne&s;s, and force of
pronunciation, will give great advantage to all that
a clergyman &s;ays, and ought by no means to be
neglected. The want of it often prevents the be&s;t
things from having their full effect upon the bulk
of mankind.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t important qualifications of a clergy|man
are tho&s;e of the heart, &s;incere and uniform
virtue and goodne&s;s. A good heart, with a mode|rate
degree of under&s;tanding and knowlege, will
enable a man to do much greater &s;ervice in the
church, than the highe&s;t abilities joined with a
vicious character. All virtues are nece&s;&s;ary to a
clergyman; all vices are unallowable in him; but
not all preci&s;ely in the &s;ame way. Some virtues
are &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, that the lea&s;t appear|ance
of the want of them is &s;candalous, and ren|ders
him ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s and contemptible.
Other virtues may not perhaps be &s;o readily or &s;o
generally mi&s;&s;ed, but to po&s;&s;e&s;s them will greatly
adorn his character. Some may properly be con|&s;idered
in both the&s;e lights.</P>
<P>Some things, which are &s;carcely regarded as
virtues, at lea&s;t are not rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on in
other men, are ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;able in a clergy|man.
Of this kind is what is commonly termed
Decency. Levity in conver&s;ation or in behaviour,
<PB N="411" REF="418">
which would &s;carcely be at all cen&s;ured in others,
will be &s;ufficient to render a clergyman ridiculous
and de&s;picable. Decency obliges him to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
in the&s;e re&s;pects, to moderation in the u&s;e of diver|&s;ions
and amu&s;ements, to &s;trict ab&s;tinence from
every appearance of evil. In every thing he &s;hould
keep him&s;elf, to the conviction of all, at a great
di&s;tance from what is unlawful. He mu&s;t rather
ab&s;tain from things indifferent, than run a ri&s;k of
offending &s;uch weak per&s;ons as are truly hone&s;t,
and do not pretend &s;cruples as a cloke for pride, or
a pretence for cen&s;uring.</P>
<P>Particular care is nece&s;&s;ary in ab&s;taining from all
tho&s;e vices which are regarded not merely as
defects of good di&s;po&s;itions, but as indications of
di&s;po&s;itions po&s;itively bad. Acts of the&s;e vices are
determinate; every &s;ingle act throws an infallible
and la&s;ting &s;tain upon the character of a clergy|man.
Thus every plain act of covetoutne&s;s, every
undue attempt to gain or to &s;ave money, as it is
always mean and gives a contemptible idea of a
man, &s;o it brings a great &s;tain upon a clergyman.
Every attempt in him to carry on a lucrative em|ployment,
or to involve him&s;elf in bu&s;ine&s;s, even
&s;uch as is lawful in it&s;elf, will be regarded as a
mark of avarice.</P>
<P>Any act of inju&s;tice, whether dictated by avarice
or by any other principle, will appear to all to be
dete&s;table in a clergyman.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="419">
All lying, fal&s;ehood, or perfidy, are likewi&s;e
regarded as po&s;itive vices, rendering the character
of a clergyman either odious or de&s;picable.</P>
<P>Every degree or kind of intemperance is emi|nently
of the &s;ame nature. A &s;ingle overt-act of
it is &s;ufficient, in the opinion of the world, to
eclip&s;e and overbalance many virtues. It mu&s;t
therefore be guarded again&s;t with the greate&s;t care.
A freedom from every habit, and even from the
&s;u&s;picion of this vice, is a qualification ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary in a clergyman.</P>
<P>Po&s;itive acts of impiety, or expre&s;&s;ions of irre|ligion,
of whatever kind they be, whether &s;wear|ing,
neglect of the &s;everal duties of outward
devotion, expre&s;&s;ions of indifference about the
principles of natural or revealed religion, &s;coffing
or talking lightly of religious and important &s;ub|jects,
will always be perfectly &s;hocking in a clergy|man,
and will render his character perfectly dete&s;t|able.</P>
<P>A freedom from all the&s;e vices is indi&s;pen&s;ably
nece&s;&s;ary in a clergyman; and in order to keep
free from them, he mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;iderable
degree of the virtues oppo&s;ite to them: an affect|ation
of them, or an hypocritical pretence to them,
will not look natural, but will betray it&s;elf by its
appearance of force to the more di&s;cerning; it
it will not always hold out; the ma&s;k will fall off
<PB N="413" REF="420">
in &s;ome unlucky moment; all will &s;ee that it was
only pretence from the beginning; the dete&s;tation
which is due to hypocri&s;y will be added to that
which the vices attempted to be concealed excite;
and both together will be thrown on the dete&s;ted
criminal. There are &s;ome of the virtues oppo&s;ite
to the vices which we have mentioned, that though
they be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the highe&s;t degree by a clergy|man,
will only be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve him from
blame, but will not be con&s;idered as giving any
con&s;iderable po&s;itive worth or beauty to his cha|racter.
Such particularly are temperance and
ju&s;tice. Temperance implies an ab&s;olute command
over all the &s;en&s;ual appetites, &s;o as to be able to
re&s;train them at all times from leading us into what
is unlawful. A mini&s;ter mu&s;t cultivate this virtue
in the highe&s;t degree, el&s;e he will more or le&s;s
expo&s;e him&s;elf to contempt; but to cultivate it to
the highe&s;t pitch will not be con&s;idered as doing
any more than pre&s;erving him from contempt.
He mu&s;t adhere to &s;trict ju&s;tice. All his dealings
with others mu&s;t be &s;trongly marked even with
ju&s;tice improved into equity: but the highe&s;t
improvement of it will only keep him blamele&s;s.
There are &s;ome other of the virtues already hinted
at, which, though &s;ome degree of them be ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary for rendering the character inoffen|&s;ive,
yet when they are cultivated in an eminent
degree, be&s;tow great dignity upon it, and are
highly ornamental to the profe&s;&s;ion. The&s;e, con|&s;idered
in this view, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to men|tion
<PB N="414" REF="421">
again, along with &s;ome others, which likewi&s;e
adorn the character of a mini&s;ter, and qualify
him greatly for the &s;everal functions of his
office.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin with Piety. Piety in all its
branches, as founded in ju&s;t &s;entiments of the
divine nature, including love, reverence, grati|tude,
re&s;ignation, tru&s;t, imitation, and fear of
God, and leading to the fervent and con&s;tant
exerci&s;e of devotion, is a temper of the greate&s;t
importance to a mini&s;ter. It was remarked already,
that expre&s;&s;ions or acts of impiety are perfectly
&s;candalous. Such a degree of piety as may pre|&s;erve
from the&s;e is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to hinder
his becoming odious: but &s;uch a low degree of it
is not &s;ufficient to qualify him for his office. The
highe&s;t pitch of it is nece&s;&s;ary to render him an
example of godline&s;s, to give him that con&s;tant
regard to God which will be the only &s;ettled prin|ciple
of diligence in the di&s;charge of the &s;everal
functions of his office, to enable him in teaching
to give a &s;triking view of the obligations of piety,
or to give amiable di&s;plays of the &s;everal acts of
devotion, or an inviting view of the plea&s;ures of
religion. The highe&s;t pitch of piety is nece&s;&s;ary
to animate us in leading the devotions of Chri&s;tians,
and to prevent our whole application to them
from degenerating into a train of hypocri&s;y or
formality.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="422">
A great degree of benevolence to mankind is
another nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in the character of a
clergyman. We might have mentioned properly
enough expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment, malice, envy,
and the like malevolent pa&s;&s;ions, among tho&s;e vices
which di&s;grace the character of a clergyman. Such
a high degree of benevolence as may not only pre|&s;erve
a mini&s;ter from the&s;e, but al&s;o produce a
warm concern for the good of others, a concern
e&s;pecially for the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls and their
eternal intere&s;ts, as may lead him to forgive in|juries,
and exert it&s;elf notwith&s;tanding the im|pul&s;es
of re&s;entment, is nece&s;&s;ary for adorning the
character of a clergyman, for enabling him to
exert him&s;elf without grudge or wearine&s;s in the
&s;everal duties by which he may benefit his people,
to give him &s;pirit and earne&s;tne&s;s in his &s;everal
mini&s;trations, to give him a con&s;tant motive to do
all the good he can.</P>
<P>Benevolence will contribute greatly to form an|other
virtue of great importance in the character
of a clergyman, true Chri&s;tian moderation. This
is a virtue which will have many occa&s;ions of
&s;howing it&s;elf, and is nece&s;&s;ary for many purpo&s;es
in the pa&s;toral office. It is necce&s;&s;ary for his living
peaceably with others, in a world where all men
cannot be of the &s;ame opinion. It is nece&s;&s;ary for
convincing tho&s;e who are in error. It is nece&s;&s;ary
for his treating controverted points, either in
public or in private, with decency; and for pre|&s;erving
<PB N="416" REF="423">
him from that rancour, fury, and intem|perate
zeal, which, being indulged, has expo&s;ed
the clergy to the highe&s;t cen&s;ure among their
more di&s;cerning adver&s;aries. It is nearly con|nected
with that meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s which is
&s;o often recommended in &s;cripture, and &s;ets off
the character of a mini&s;ter to &s;o great advantage.</P>
<P>Humility will be of great u&s;e for enabling a
mini&s;ter to &s;ubmit ea&s;ily to all the little offices of
beneficence which may contribute to the advantage
of men, or to his own u&s;efulne&s;s. A vain, &s;elf-conceited
per&s;on can have no true reli&s;h of divine
truths.</P>
<P>It was already ob&s;erved that plain expre&s;&s;ions
of avarice and worldly-mindedne&s;s expo&s;e a mini&s;ter
to ab&s;olute contempt: but it is nece&s;&s;ary that he
have a much greater degree of elevation above the
world, than to pre&s;erve him merely from contempt.
A &s;ettled view of the vanity of the enjoyments of
this earth, and a &s;uperiority to them, would bani&s;h
all the workings of avarice and ambition, party-&s;pirit
and faction, and would add the greate&s;t force
and life to all a man's &s;entiments and di&s;cour&s;es
on &s;piritual things.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention one other qualification of great
moment. It is to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the true &s;pirit
of his office. A &s;en&s;e of the importance of this
office, an ardent de&s;ire to combat and overcome
<PB N="417" REF="424">
the difficulties of it, a zeal for promoting its end,
a plea&s;ure in being employed in its duties, are
ingredients in this &s;pirit. And this &s;pirit rai&s;ed to
a high pitch is nece&s;&s;ary for keeping a clergyman's
bu&s;ine&s;s from being a drudgery, and for enabling
him to perform it with true force and reli&s;h.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal qualifications it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a
mini&s;ter to cultivate as long as he lives. It cannot
therefore be expected that he &s;hould be perfect in
them when he enters into this office. But every
man who has not in him the principles and begin|nings
of all the&s;e qualifications, and a &s;ettled re&s;o|lution
and eager de&s;ire to improve and become
perfect in them, is unfit for this office, and inca|pable
of di&s;charging its duties properly.</P>
<P>The&s;e are only hints on the principal qualifica|tions
for this office, and the way in which each is
conducive to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Preparation for the Pa&s;toral Office.</HEAD>
<P>AS the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for the pa&s;toral
office are ea&s;ily deducible from the &s;everal
duties of that office, &s;o the nece&s;&s;ary preparation
may be deduced from the con&s;ideration of the&s;e
qualifications. Whatever &s;tudy or exerci&s;e is pro|per
for forming or improving any of the&s;e qualifi|cations,
is very proper for preparing tho&s;e who
de&s;ign to enter into the pa&s;toral office.</P>
<P>Good &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding are improved by
employing rea&s;on and judgement often upon all
kinds of &s;ubjects both of &s;cience and life, and by
imbibing ju&s;t and &s;olid principles from reflection,
reading, and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Memory will be cultivated by frequently accu&s;|toming
our&s;elves to recollect what we know, and
by frequently committing things to memory and
repeating them.</P>
<P>There is no faculty of the mind, on improving
which &s;o little care is commonly be&s;towed in edu|cation,
as the imagination: yet it is certainly im|proveable
to a very con&s;iderable degree. It is
<PB N="419" REF="426">
improved by reading works in which real genius
and invention are di&s;played. The&s;e not only &s;up|ply
hints to a per&s;on's thoughts, but at the &s;ame
time give an impul&s;e to his fancy, and prompt
him to pur&s;ue the&s;e hints. Works of poetry are
particularly proper for improving fancy, in what
regards figures, images, and ornament; but too
much &s;tudy may hurt fancy, in&s;tead of improving
it. The exertion of memory is always ea&s;ier than
that of invention. On this account, if a per&s;on's
memory be &s;tored with many things &s;aid by others
on a &s;ubject, his thoughts will fall mo&s;t naturally
into that track which they have followed; whereas,
if he had been ignorant of their &s;entiments, he
might have perhaps pur&s;ued a new and original
track. If one be acquainted with the images
which others have u&s;ed, fancy will be apt, from
the repo&s;itories of memory, to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch as
have been u&s;ed already; but if it had not been &s;o
much cramped by memory, and more accu&s;tomed
to invention, it might have di&s;covered new and
original ones. Compo&s;ition on different &s;orts of
&s;ubjects is the proper method of improving inven|tion.
It would not perhaps be improper likewi&s;e,
&s;ometimes to &s;et the mind a &s;earching for all the
images or illu&s;trations which can be applied to a
particular &s;ubject: this exerci&s;e might &s;harpen the
inventive faculty, and give it a habit of ranging
ea&s;ily and freely.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="427">
With re&s;pect to the acquired intellectual qualifi|cations
before mentioned, or the different &s;orts of
knowlege nece&s;&s;ary for a clergyman, it is only
needful to ob&s;erve, that each branch of knowlege
is to be acquired by &s;tudying it with care and
application. All then that is proper on this head
is either to give general directions concerning the
be&s;t method of &s;tudy, or to &s;how the order and
manner in which the &s;everal branches of knowlege
already mentioned may be acquired. The former
is &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;ubject, that it would require too
much time to enter into it particularly; and it is a
&s;ubject to which it is pre&s;umed none of you are
ab&s;olutely &s;trangers. The latter we &s;hall now
touch upon.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that every per&s;on who aims at the
pa&s;toral office has been educated in the Greek and
Latin languages; and that, during the time of his
application to the &s;ciences, he has improved in the
knowlege of both, and acquired an acquaintance
with, and ta&s;te in, cla&s;&s;ical learning. It is likewi&s;e
taken for granted, that he has &s;tudied the &s;everal
parts of philo&s;ophy, particularly the ab&s;tract &s;ci|ences,
which lay open the principles of human
nature, which teach the rules of rea&s;oning, and
the truths of natural religion and morality. But,
in improving him&s;elf in the&s;e parts of knowlege,
by applying profe&s;&s;edly and &s;tatedly to the &s;tudy of
them, he may very properly &s;pend the fir&s;t year
<PB N="421" REF="428">
after he devotes him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of divinity.
By clo&s;e application for that &s;pace of time, he
may make con&s;iderable progre&s;s in all the&s;e, &s;o as
to be able not only to retain, but to carry him&s;elf
forward in them afterwards, by making them a
bye-&s;tudy or an amu&s;ement, while he is carrying
on others profe&s;&s;edly and as his &s;tated bu&s;ine&s;s.
The &s;econd year he may make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
all that regards the truth and evidences of revealed
religion, and make &s;ome progre&s;s in the &s;tudy of
the &s;criptures. It may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that
from the very beginning of his application to the
&s;tudy of divinity, and even before, he has, by
frequently reading the &s;criptures as a Chri&s;tian,
acquired con&s;iderable knowlege of the plain and
practical parts of them, and has a great deal of
the&s;e parts dige&s;ted in his memory, and in readi|ne&s;s
to be recollected, when occa&s;ion requires.
But what we a&s;&s;ign to this period of his &s;tudies is
a more profe&s;&s;ed and critical application to them.
In &s;tudying the truth of revealed religion, he ought
fir&s;t of all to attain a thorough knowlege, and to
form a comprehen&s;ive idea of the po&s;itive evidences
of religion, whether external or internal, and
afterwards to examine the particular objections
that are rai&s;ed again&s;t them, and the an&s;wers to
the&s;e objections. In &s;tudying the &s;criptures, he
&s;hould read them in the original languages, begin|ning
with the New Te&s;tament, taking the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the be&s;t commentators, and, at the &s;ame time,
carrying on the &s;tudy of &s;uch things as tend to
<PB N="422" REF="429">
illu&s;trate the &s;criptures; as the rules of genuine
critici&s;m, and the hi&s;tories of antiquities, cu&s;toms,
&s;ects, &amp;c. which are alluded to in them. If one
be a diligent &s;tudent, the &s;econd year will be &s;uffi|cient
to give him the knowlege of the evidences of
revelation, and to carry him through the &s;tudy of
the New Te&s;tament. The preparatory &s;tudies
already mentioned are u&s;ually attended with the
&s;tudy of ancient and modern hi&s;tory; and if this
&s;tudy be carried on as a relaxation through all the
period we have hitherto con&s;idered, the &s;tudent
will have made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in it, and
may ea&s;ily, as he certainly ought, carry it on ever
after in the &s;ame way. In the third and fourth
years one may make con&s;iderable progre&s;s in &s;tudy|ing
the Old Te&s;tament, and in acquiring the
knowlege of the hi&s;tory of the church, the &s;y&s;tem
of religion, and the &s;everal controver&s;ies that have
ari&s;en in it. The &s;y&s;tem and the hi&s;tory of the
church ought always to be &s;tudied together; they
will throw mutual light on each other, and they
are in fact little el&s;e than different ways of con&s;ider|ing
the &s;ame thing. A fifth year may be very
properly employed in &s;uch &s;tudies (not dropping
tho&s;e entirely which have been already mentioned)
as have a more immediate connection with Preach|ing,
and the &s;everal methods of in&s;truction nece&s;|&s;ary
in the pa&s;toral office. A per&s;on may be
employed in &s;toring his mind with a variety of
religious and moral &s;entiments, by the &s;tudy of the
be&s;t writers both ancient and modern, on practical
<PB N="423" REF="430">
&s;ubjects. He may likewi&s;e apply to &s;tudy carefully
the rules of compo&s;ition, and the be&s;t models of
eloquence, particularly the orations of Cicero
and Demo&s;thenes, and accu&s;tom him&s;elf, more
frequently than before, to compo&s;ition and to ju&s;t
pronunciation. We do not &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e things
to be wholly delayed till now; on the contrary,
the &s;tudies already mentioned cannot be carried
on without a man's having dipped into them;
we only a&s;&s;ign this as the proper time for applying
to them more profe&s;&s;edly, and making them one's
leading &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The time we have thus parcelled out will be
&s;ufficient for a man's acquiring the elements of all
the parts of knowlege nece&s;&s;ary to a clergyman:
and by &s;tudying them in this regular order, he
will pre&s;erve di&s;tinct all the knowlege he acquires,
and fix &s;uch a regular plan in his mind, that
whatever acqui&s;itions he makes afterwards in any
of the parts, will fall naturally into their proper
places. But it is only the elements that he will
acquire. Every time that he reviews any of the
parts, he will di&s;cover &s;omething new, and make
farther progre&s;s. He may afterwards, through
the whole of his life, be employed in pro&s;ecuting
any of the&s;e branches to which his inclination or
opportunities determine him at a particular time.
And if he has acquired a true &s;pirit of &s;tudy in
youth, he will find enough in the&s;e &s;everal
<PB N="424" REF="431">
branches to make his whole life pa&s;s both agree|ably
and with continual improvement.</P>
<P>I would recommend it to tho&s;e who are ju&s;t
beginning to &s;tudy divinity, to &s;et out on the plan
we have delineated; and if any of greater &s;tanding
have not hitherto ob&s;erved it or &s;ome other regular
order of &s;tudy, they will perhaps find their account
in beginning it immediately. They will be able
to complete it in a &s;horter time; and in pur&s;uing
it, all the knowlege they have acquired by more
de&s;ultory &s;tudies, will ea&s;ily fall into its proper
place, and be rendered more clear and &s;trong.</P>
<P>But though a competent degree of knowlege in
the&s;e &s;everal &s;ubjects be nece&s;&s;ary, before one's
entering into the mini&s;try, and may be acquired in
the manner now pointed out, yet every per&s;on
ought to &s;et him&s;elf to make farther progre&s;s and
improvement after that time. &startq;What is a very
good beginning, is by no means a &s;ufficient
&s;tock to go on with; and even that will-le&s;&s;en, if
no pains be taken to increa&s;e it. Per&s;ons of lower
abilities and attainments are in danger, without
this, of becoming u&s;ele&s;s and de&s;pi&s;ed; and they
who &s;et out with greater advantages are bound to
endeavour at doing, in proportion, greater
&s;ervices to the church of God<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Secker's 1&s;t Charge.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="432">
It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as a preparation for
carrying on the&s;e &s;tudies, indeed for acquiring any
real knowlege, and therefore a nece&s;&s;ary prepara|tion
for the pa&s;toral office, to lay a&s;ide all preju|dices,
and to cultivate a fair, unbia&s;&s;ed temper of
mind, di&s;po&s;ing to the impartial examination of
every &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;everal moral qualifications mentioned can
be acquired only by practi&s;ing the virtues which
they imply. It is of importance for the divine to
begin from the earlie&s;t youth to practi&s;e them. As
&s;oon as he re&s;olves on his profe&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould
immediately begin with firm re&s;olution to practi&s;e
that blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s of behaviour, and to cultivate
that true worth of heart, which are nece&s;&s;ary in
his calling. The virtues which are e&s;&s;entially
requi&s;ite to keep the character of a clergyman
blamele&s;s and free from contempt, he &s;hould be
ma&s;ter of from the very fir&s;t, &s;o as to be never
chargeable with any acts of intemperance, inju&s;tice,
fal&s;ehood, impiety, nor even of levity in conver|&s;ation
or behaviour: and his whole conduct &s;hould
&s;how, even in the earlie&s;t life, that he has the
&s;eeds of the &s;ublimer virtues which adorn the
mini&s;terial character, and that he is cultivating
them with diligence and &s;peed. This early prac|tice
of univer&s;al virtue is nece&s;&s;ary on many
accounts. Any defect of virtue which a man has
&s;hown, any indecency in which he has allowed
him&s;elf, though long before, will be remembered
<PB N="426" REF="433">
to his di&s;advantage after he has entered into the
pa&s;toral office, and will throw a reflection on his
character. It will expo&s;e his after-virtue to the
&s;u&s;picion, or perhaps the accu&s;ation of hypocri&s;y,
which will greatly dimini&s;h his u&s;efulne&s;s. Be&s;ides,
a con&s;iderable change of manners on one's entering
on this office, or a little before, is always ungrace|ful,
and has the di&s;agreeable appearance of force
and con&s;traint. Farther, one's indulging him&s;elf
while young, in manners which he mu&s;t break off
when he becomes a clergyman, fo&s;ters habits which
it will be difficult for him to overcome, and which
may perhaps make him a &s;lave to vice or levity
through his whole life. Many things which are
regarded as indecencies in a mini&s;ter, may be
e&s;teemed mere trifles, and perhaps they are &s;o in
their own nature. But trifles have often very im|portant
con&s;equences. A mini&s;ter can execute his
functions only by the authority which the opinions
of men give him; and therefore mu&s;t regard the
opinions of men, while he endeavours to rectify
them. As vice is wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with the
mini&s;terial character, &s;o it is of importance that
one who is preparing him&s;elf for this office have as
many re&s;traints from it as po&s;&s;ible; and it will be a
con&s;iderable re&s;traint that he be known, wherever
he appears, as a per&s;on who has the &s;acred function
in his view. In a word, one who would prepare
him&s;elf for the pa&s;toral office, &s;hould always act,
in every re&s;pect, in &s;uch a way that he may have
no occa&s;ion, when he enters into this office, to
<PB N="427" REF="434">
make the lea&s;t alteration in his manners or beha|viour.</P>
<P>All that has been &s;aid on the pa&s;toral office has
no tendency to gratify idle curio&s;ity, or to give
&s;cope to a di&s;putatious humour. It tends wholly
to practice; and the knowlege of it is of no u&s;e,
except it be reduced to practice. It will de&s;erve to
be remembered by you, that it is very po&s;&s;ible for
a per&s;on to have a &s;ublime idea of morals, either in
general or as regarding a particular profe&s;&s;ion, and
yet be very defective in practice.</P>
