An ENQUIRY
INTO
The re&s;pective Dangers of giving the Spani&s;h Mo|narchy
to the Emperour, as well as to King Phi|lip,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> $or this la&s;t Eight
Years of the War, &s;eem'd to Depend
but upon one main and capital Ar|ticle,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> The Surrendering or E|vacuating
<HI>Spain</HI> by King <HI>Philip,</HI> to King <HI>Charles</HI>
III. and this having brought the Debates about
it, <HI>upon any Treaties that were offer'd,</HI> within a
narrower Compa&s;s than formerly, we found
the la&s;t Conferences at <HI>Gertruydenberg</HI> confin'd to
this &s;hort Head; what Security &s;hould be gi|ven
on one Hand, and what Equivalent on the
Other, for the effectual Evacuating the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Dominions by King <HI>Philip?</HI> And upon their not
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Agreeing in this Point, that Treaty or Meeting
broke up, and the War went on purely on this
Head: If any Man equi$ed what we Fought
for in this War, the An&s;wer was &s;hort, we
Fought for <HI>Spain.</HI> All the Pretences of this
War, all the Manife&s;toes, Defences, or Argu|ments
on either Side, turn'd upon this Point
only, The Evacuating <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Security
for the Performance: We could ask little of the
King of <HI>France</HI> but what he readily enough a|greed
to, but this, and had this been heartily
either Propo&s;ed on one Hand, or Con&s;ented
to on the Other, the War had been at an End
long ago</P>
<P>But behold when we thought our Peace as
good as Concluded, and that whenever we
plea&s;ed but to offer a Proport$on or Equivalent
to King <HI>Philip,</HI> we might at our Plea&s;ure put
an End to the Stri&s;e; a New and unexpected
Difficulty is ri&s;en up, of &s;o perplexing a Na|ture,
&s;o odd and intricate in its Circnm&s;tances,
that even, tho' the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould come
and &s;ay to us, that his Grand&s;on was ready to
Evacuate <HI>Spain,</HI> to lay down his Preten&s;ions,
and give up the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown, as we
formerly De&s;ired and Demanded, we are now
uncertain whether we had be&s;t take it or no, and
if we &s;hould accept it, are &s;till more Doubtful
to whom we &s;hould give it, or in brief <HI>what we
&s;hould do with it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
This New Doubt ari&s;es from Two Incidents
which have Interveened &s;ince the &s;aid Confe|rences
at <HI>Gertruydenberg,</HI> and which humane
Prudence could then have no Pro&s;pect of. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
The Death of the Emperour <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> Elde&s;t
Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and <HI>Secondly,</HI>
The Election of <HI>Char.</HI> III. (whom we called
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and in who&s;e Name all this
War has been carry'd on) to the Imperial
Crown, by the Stile of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. Emperour
of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>By the Con&s;equence of the&s;e unexpected E|vents,
<HI>Europe</HI> is now acted by New Councils;
differing and incon&s;i&s;ting Intere&s;ts ri&s;e up in the
Affairs of <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> the Dangers of heap|ing
up Power upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which
may in time be &s;uperior to the re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> be|gin
to appear formidable and frightful; the
Nations call to mind the fatal Greatne&s;s of <HI>Cha.</HI>
V. <HI>Philip</HI> II. and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who&s;e Power
threaten'd <HI>Europe</HI> with univer&s;al Bondage for
&s;everal Ages, and who$e formidable Strength
took it's ri&s;e and beginning only in the Con|junction
of the Empire with the Dominions of
<HI>Spain,</HI> in the Per&s;on of <HI>Cha.</HI> V. which, though
all the Electors con&s;ented to, Five of them had
Fifty Years Lei&s;ure to repent of.</P>
<P>It is not the lea&s;t Unhappine&s;s in the pre&s;ent
Di&s;pute, that the &s;everal Parties are divided
in their Thoughts, to whom they &s;hall allot
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy: But the Competitors
are &s;o few, and their Circum&s;tances &s;o equal,
that the Que&s;tion $eturns, even upon a Point
which &s;eems very hazardous to us all, and in|deed
looks at fir&s;t &s;ight&punc; very frightfully <HI>(viz)</HI>
Whether, after all the Blood that has been
&s;pilt, Money &s;pent, De&s;olation made, Lo&s;&s;es
&s;u&s;tain'd, and Perplexity &s;uffer'd, by the Con|$ederated
Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> to gain this <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Monarchy from King <HI>Philip</HI> to King <HI>Charles,</HI>
it &s;hall not now appear more for the publick
Safety and Intere&s;t to give it to King <HI>Philip,</HI>
whom they have been fighting again&s;t, than to
K. <HI>Charles,</HI> whom they have been fighting for:
And though this might look like a &s;evere Sa|tyr
upon the Wi&s;dom and Councils of the Con|federates
in general, who have with &s;uch Ea|gerne&s;s
and Application been thus long Fight|ing,
and &s;pending their Blood and Trea&s;ure to
pull that down, which it appears their Intere&s;t
to &s;et up, and <HI>Vice Ver&s;a,</HI> to keep that low,
which they have fought &s;o vigorou&s;ly to &s;et up;
I mean the new Emperour: Yet all this is
accounted for, by the New and Un$ore&s;een Ac|cident
of the Late Emperour's dying without
Heirs Male, and the Nece&s;&s;ity, in order to e|&s;tabli&s;h
the other Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> of electing
King <HI>Charles</HI> III. Emperour of <HI>Germany</HI> in his
&s;tead.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
This Event has in many Ca&s;es alter'd the face
of Affairs, and hu&s;tling, as we may &s;ay, the
Intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe</HI> together, has placed many
of them in differing Po&s;itions from what they
were before: So that New Councils, New
Dangers, New Methods of Safety, New Fa|ces,
and a New Situation of Affairs, appear in
many Parts of the Confederacy, to &s;ome the
Dangers of &s;etting the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> on the
Head of the Emperour &s;eem very great and
terrible, much greater than tho&s;e of &s;etting it
on the Head of King <HI>Philip;</HI> and to &s;ome ju&s;t
the contrary: To &s;ome the Dangers of the <HI>Au|&s;trian</HI>
Greatne&s;s are nearer, and tho&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI>
more remote; to others the Greatne&s;s of the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> are nearer and more affecting,
and tho&s;e of the Emperor or Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI>
growing too powerful are more remote, and
le&s;s affrighting than that of <HI>Bourbon&punc;</HI> And as
the re&s;pective Branches of the Confederacy are
more or le&s;s affected with the&s;e Views, &s;o they
are more or le&s;s interre&s;ted in the pre&s;ent De|bate,
whether on one Side or another.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, this Change of Affairs
gives a New Turn to the whole Negotiation
of the Peace; and &s;ome of tho&s;e, who before
were clear in the Pro&s;ecution of the War, till the
whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy &s;hould be re&s;tored to
the Augu&s;t Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> find Rea&s;on, even
from the &s;ame upright and ju&s;t Foundation
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>(viz.)</HI> The Safety and Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> to be
now quite of another Mind; believing, that if
all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy was to be given up to
the Emperour, the Ballance of Power, &s;o much
aim'd at, would be effectually de&s;troyed in
<HI>Europe;</HI> And that they &s;hould be &s;o far from
e&s;tabli&s;hing the Safety and the Peace they &s;$ek
for, that in a few Years they &s;hould be obliged
to begin a New War in <HI>Europe,</HI> to &s;uccour the
Oppre&s;&s;ed Princes, who would be cru&s;hed and
over-powered by the Neighbourhood and En|croachments
of the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Power, which by
this Conjunction would be made too great for
them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;ome, who have receiv'd
&s;uch terrible Ideas of the <HI>French</HI> Greatne&s;s, that
no Dangers that are remote can equal their
Concern for, are not only quite of another Opi|nion,
but are too apt to reproach the other
with being unju&s;t to their former declared
Principles, and with being brought over to
<HI>French</HI> Councils, managed by <HI>French</HI> Influence,
and the like.</P>
<P>The Author of the&s;e Sheets acknowledges
&s;o much of his own Sentiments before-hand,
that he thinks both the&s;e may be in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
wrong, in the &s;everal Steps they have taken
in this great Affair, but more e&s;pecially that
both are wrong, in the &s;evere Reflections they
ca&s;t upon one another, and the Cen&s;ures they
<PB N="9" REF="8">
make, which neither one way or other &s;eem
to open or explain the Matter, but only to
exa&s;perate Parties, and increa&s;e the unhappy
Divi&s;ions with which this Nation has too long
already been perplex'd, And not only &s;o, but
that the&s;e Heats are more e&s;pecially Fatal at
this Time, as they may not only affect our
Parties and di&s;turb our Private Peace, but as
they make tho&s;e Divi&s;ions National, and cau&s;e
them to &s;pread abroad among the Confederates
and Allies to make them jealous of and un|ea&s;y
to one another. Nor is this all yet; but
the Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies and Un|ea&s;ine&s;s
have a natural tendency to break and
blow up the pre&s;ent Grand Alliance again&s;t
<HI>France,</HI> upon which, and the right Application
of every Part and Party to the Intere&s;t of the
whole, depends the general Safety at this time;
&s;ince <HI>France</HI> being now brought to a Willingne&s;s
for Peace, and that upon Conditions in many
Parts very advantagious to the Confederates;
Yet we find his Power not &s;o entirely broken,
but that, if our Mi&s;under&s;tandings and Un|ea&s;ine&s;s
at Home, &s;hould be carry'd on to any
Length, fatal to the pre&s;ent good Under&s;tand|ing
among the Allies, on which the Safety of
the whole Confederacy does &s;o much depend,
and if any Rupture among us &s;hould unhappily
fall out, &s;he would be able to take hold of it;
and make &s;uch Advantages thereof, as would
<PB N="10" REF="9">
bid fair to re&s;tore her to all that Exce&s;s o$
Power, which had made her &s;o formidable to
<HI>Europe;</HI> and by Con&s;equence the End of the&s;e
long Wars, which is now &s;o happily in View,
would be effectually di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>It cannot be an unprofitable Ob&s;ervation to
our Allies abroad, or to our People at home&punc;
to remind them, that <HI>France</HI> is by this long
War &s;o far reduced, as that the ju&s;t Occa&s;ion
for which the War was begun <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Ex|orbitance
of his Power, &s;eem'd to be effectual|ly
removed. The Conce&s;&s;ions made by the King
of <HI>France</HI> at the late Treaty, are a &s;ufficient E|vidence
of this; and the Conditions of the lat$
Preliminaries are &s;o full of the &s;everal Countrie$
Cities, Towns, and &s;trong Places, which <HI>Franc$</HI>
is willing to give up, as will reduce the <HI>Frenc$</HI>
Greatne&s;s to a Limitation, <HI>Europe</HI> would hav$
but little or no rea&s;on for the Future to call Ex$
orbitant.</P>
<P>But &s;hould any &s;uch Breach among the Con|federates
happen, which God forbid, as &s;houl$
remove the Fears and Apprehen&s;ions of thei$
Power, &s;o that <HI>France</HI> &s;hould $all off from the&s;$
Conce&s;&s;ions, and the Confederates &s;hould not $word$
far agree, as to carry on this War, or perhap$
not be in a Condition, it would be a Que&s;tio$
few would venture to &s;olve, when it may b$
likely to reduce <HI>France</HI> to &s;uch Conce&s;sions a$gain.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
It is to be hoped, the Sen&s;e of the Danger o$
<HI>Europe</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, will move the Confede|rates
to more Noble Sentiments, than &s;uch as
may have the&s;e fatal Con&s;equences; But as no
Caution can be too great in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, &s;o no
Man that is truly &s;en&s;ible, how bu&s;y &s;ome a|mong
us are to provoke to the Di&s;agreement a|fore&s;aid,
and what Hopes they entertain of the
Succe&s;s of it, can avoid being filled with Fear,
and &s;ay every needful Thing to prevent it.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Author of this Tract thinks it is a
Caution every Party ought to accept from him
with Candour and Kindne&s;s; and that they
who pretend to the lea&s;t Concern for the Safety
and Tranquillity of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Pro&s;perity of the
<HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t, or the Good of their Native
Country of <HI>Birtain,</HI> would do well to reflect,
whether the pre&s;ent Humour, which too much
prevails among us, of oppo&s;ing the General Peace
becau&s;e of their Prejudices at the Party concer|ned
in making it, is not a thing of &s;uch ruinous
Con&s;equence, as may in the end prevent our ha|ving
any Peace at all, or at lea&s;t di&s;$ble us from
obtaining &s;o good Conditions as at this time
may be obtained.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ome People run &s;o great a
Length in Oppo&s;ing the Steps now taking to|wards
a general Treaty of Peace, as to talk of
Ways and Means to be propo&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> a|mong
private Per&s;ons, to enable the <HI>Dutch</HI> to
<PB N="12" REF="11">
carry on the War without us; I &s;ay, to be pro|po&s;ed,
becau&s;e I cannot but think &s;uch People&punc;
if any &s;uch there are, will look before them, e'r$
they take &s;uch a Step, and Con&s;ider well the
Danger of it to them&s;elves, there being generaly
Speaking, a large Interval between the For|ming
and the Executing &s;uch dangerous At|tempts
as the&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;uch People have al&s;o another thing to
Con&s;ider, and which when they come to look
into, will no doubt Check their furious Zea$
for the Confu&s;ion of <HI>Europe,</HI> and this is, that&punc;
they will find the <HI>Dutch</HI> under&s;tand their Inte|re&s;t
better, and have a clearer Sen&s;e of things,
than to embark on &s;o weak a View, and with
&s;o Empty a Project of Support, as the warmth
of a few private People would be, and who as
&s;oon as Detected in their New Scheme, would
be Treated at Home as Rebels and Traitors&punc;
even by a Government, which neverthele&s;s
would be A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the &s;ame Nation, which
the&s;e would pretend to Support in an illega$
and irregular Way: But of this I &s;hall &s;peak
more largely when I come to the Particulars.</P>
<P>But to return to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The
new Debates as to the Intere&s;t of Di&s;po&s;ing the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, on this unfore&s;een Event
of the Death of the Emperour, it is ob&s;erveable
that till now, it had been a Que&s;tion only be|tween
the King of <HI>France</HI> and his Grand&s;on,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
King <HI>Philip,</HI> on the one Side, and the Con&s;e|derates
on the other; who &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the
Monarchy of <HI>Spain.</HI> Nay it had not been a
Que&s;tion there either, but the King of <HI>France</HI>
had Conceded it to <HI>Char.</HI> III. by the Prelimi|naries
adju&s;ted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and after at <HI>Ger|truydenberg,</HI>
only Contending for &s;ome little
hold of it, that his Grand&s;on King <HI>Philip,</HI> might
not fall a Rent Charge upon his Hands, and be|come
a Refuge in his Court among other So|vereigns,
that have fled thither for Sanctuary;
but might remain a King, tho' but with a &s;mall
Dominion, little better than the Name; for
<HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> was the Sum of his De|mands,
with the few <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Towns on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> which they afterwards rece|ded
from too.</P>
<P>But upon this New Occa&s;ion of the Death
of the Late Emperour <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> the Di&s;pute hath
extended it &s;el$ into divers Branches; and it is
now an E$quiry among the Confederates too,
and perhaps an Enquiry more Difficult to be
An&s;wer'd than it was before; to whom &s;hall
the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> be allotted by a Treaty
of Peace?</P>
<P>I &s;hall as exactly as Publick Notice of &s;uch
things will permit, give a &s;hort Sketch of the
Opinions of other People about it, and then &s;ub|join
what occurs to immedia$e Ob&s;ervation,
Fortifying it with &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as the Circum|&s;tances
<PB N="14" REF="13">
of the Ca&s;e may offer; and allowing as
due a Weight, and as ju&s;t a Regard, to the &s;e|veral
Arguments u&s;ed in this Ca&s;e, as I would
have allowed to my own.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some People are po&s;itive for giving the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy to the Emperour <HI>Ch.</HI> VI.
without taking any Umbrage at his Greatne&s;s&punc;
they &s;ay the Circum&s;tances of the Empire differ
from what they were in the Days of <HI>Char.</HI> the
Vth. That the re&s;t of the World are in a bet|ter
Condition to curb him in an undue Exerci&s;e
of his Power. That the va&s;t Extent of his Do|minions
will be &s;o far from giving him an Ex|orbitance
of Power, that they render that Power
Unweildy, and a Burthen to it &s;elf; That the
Dominionly &s;o &s;eparated and extended, una|ble
to Help and Relieve one another, that like
a Whale among I&s;lands, or in Shoals, when
&s;truck by the Harpineers, he beats him&s;elf to
Pieces for want of Sea Room. That in the
Days of <HI>Char.</HI> Vth neither <HI>Holland</HI> was a State,
or <HI>France</HI> in any Figure; nor was there any
Naval Power Superiour to the Emperour;
whereas now &s;hould the Emperour attack any
of them all, either <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>Bri|tain,</HI>
are able to cut off his Comunication with
the <HI>Indies;</HI> nay even with <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf, and
with all the I&s;lands; &s;o that the Power of the
Empire is nothing to what it then was. This
and much more, make up what they allege
$span$.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Others are for giving, <HI>Spain</HI> to the
Emperour meerly becau&s;e it &s;hou'd not come
into the Hands of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbone.</HI> They
know by general Notion, that it is an allow'd
Principle, and a Fundamental, in the Ca&s;e of
the pre&s;ent War, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy
mu&s;t not whatever comes of it, fall into the
Hands of <HI>France.</HI> They know no Difference be|tween
<HI>Lewis</HI> XIV, and his Grand&s;on <HI>Philip;</HI> they
know very well the ab&s;olute Command that
Great Monarch has over his Subjects of every
Degree, not excepting his Grand&s;on <HI>Philip;</HI>
they know that mighty Obligation which <HI>Philip</HI>
V. is under to his Grandfather; that to him he
Owes his being, Called to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Throne;
that his Grandfather not only &s;et him up, but
has kept him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Monarchy al|mo&s;t
at the Expence of his own; at lea&s;t at the
Expence of many Thou&s;ands of his Subjects, and
many Millions of his Trea&s;ure: He mu&s;t be
Ingrateful to the highe&s;t Degree, if he can for|get
&s;uch Obligations, the greate&s;t that one Man
can heap upon another; and enhanced with
&s;uch Particulars to make it yet greater, that no
Prince ever did more for another, even almo&s;t
to his own Ruin, and to the Ruin of his Sub|jects;
and therefore they cannot but think the
Per&s;ons and Intere&s;ts will ever be the &s;ame. That
<HI>Philip</HI> V. will ever own his Crown to his Grand|father,
and be Subjected &s;o far to his Rules, Or|dering,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and Reque&s;ts; that as it re&s;pects us the
Con&s;ederates, it mu&s;t be reckoned the &s;ame
thing Effectually and Eventually, to give the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy to King <HI>Philip,</HI> as to give it
to the King of <HI>France;</HI> and for this Rea&s;on, they
are for the Conce&s;&s;ion of the Whole, to be made
to the Emperour; not but that they are Con|vinced
it may be Dangerous &s;o to do, but be|cau&s;e
they think it is the lea&s;t Mi&s;chief of the
Two, and that the other way it mu&s;t Inevita|bly
come to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Others are neither for giving it to one
or other, but Reviving the Old and Exploded
Notion of a <HI>Partition,</HI> are for Dividing it, &s;ome
to one Hand &s;ome to another; &s;o by that means
to weaken the Whole, and take from <HI>Europe</HI> the
Apprehen&s;ion of Danger, from it, one way or o|ther.
They alledge that if it &s;hould be given
to King <HI>Philip,</HI> there is a manife&s;t Danger to
<HI>Europe,</HI> from the &s;trict Union there is between
him and his Grandfather the King of <HI>France;</HI> that
they will be always in one and the &s;ame Inte|re&s;t,
tho' they &s;hould enter into never &s;o many
Engagements to the Contra$y; that there are
many concurring Accidents which may &s;erve
to Unite them more clo&s;ely than ever, and &s;ome

the State of the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> upon &s;uch a

Ob&s;ervations, which we &s;hall fill up this
Tract with, to give here the Variety of Schemes
the Projection of this Partition lays down, as
the Ground-Plat of the Publick Peace; it may
&s;uffice, that they go all upon this main Point:
That the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy &s;hould thereby be
rendred &s;o weak, that to who&s;e Share &s;oever it
may fall, it may not be &s;uch an Addition of

<P><HI>2dly,</HI>
Tho&s;e who are for giving <HI>Spain,</HI> with
all the Dominions thereto belonging, to the Em|peror,

<PB N="20" REF="19">
&s;o, and the Dangers of leaving it to the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of <HI>France,</HI> forgotten in the fir&s;t Place, to let
us know how they intend to get them out of
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Philip</HI> V. They omit nothing
that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> at the Fir&s;t En|trance
upon this la&s;t Breach, publickly own'd
and acknowledg'd King <HI>Philip,</HI> and &s;ent Am|ba&s;&s;adors
to compliment him upon his Acce&s;&s;i|on
to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Throne: That by this Act
they led the People of <HI>Spain</HI> to a general recei|ving
him, and giving their Faith, Homage,
and Allegiance to him, as their lawful King.
What &s;uch an Action would have been called
by us, had the King of <HI>France</HI> done it, I forbear
to inquire into here. The Ca&s;e for which it is
mentioned here, is only to note, that having
encouraged the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation by this Proceed|ing
to receive and crown King <HI>Philip,</HI> no doubt
it has been the more difficult from that very
Occa&s;ion, to bring them back again at Plea|&s;ure
to &s;wear Alledgiance to another, meerly
becau&s;e we think fit to &s;et him up and &s;upport
him.</P>
<P>The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion King <HI>Philip</HI> has thus gain'd,
has been twice, <HI>if not, as we may &s;ay, three times</HI>
un&s;ucce&s;sfully attempted; and though that
Monarch has been obliged two &s;everal Times
to abandon his Capital, and fly from <HI>Madrid;</HI>
yet Heaven has as often &s;eem'd to favour his
Cau&s;e, and the Con$ederates have been in their
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Turns by plain Force obliged to quit the Field,
and retreat even withing the Gates of <HI>Barcelona.</HI>
Nor has this been without infinite Expence of
Blood in two Battles; the Fir&s;t at <HI>Almanza,</HI>
where the whole Confederate Army was over|thrown
with &s;uch a Slaughter, and &s;o com|pleat
a Victory, as exceeds, in Proportion to
the Number of Troops, any Battel of this Age,
not <HI>Blenheim</HI> it &s;el$ excepted; The other at <HI>Bri|huega</HI>
and <HI>Villa Vicio&s;a;</HI> which may be called
but one Action; where, whatever Pretences
Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> made to a Victory, 'tis evi|dent
the Confederate Army was in a Manner
ruin'd, Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> obliged to quit the
whole Kingdom of <HI>Aragon,</HI> and made his Re|treat
not into <HI>Catalonia</HI> only, but as was &s;aid
above, to the very Walls of <HI>Barcelona;</HI> where
if he was not be&s;ieged and driven to Sea, both
he and King <HI>Charles</HI> III. with all their Court
and Adherents, it was more owing to the ill
Condition of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Affairs, than any
Po$$$$e they were in to defend them&s;elves; ha|ving
neither Troops to fight, Magazines of Arms
or Ammunition, Provi&s;ions to &s;eed them, or Mo|ney
to pay them; and this for five Months
after their Retreat: So that Count <HI>Staremberg</HI>
was heard to &s;ay, That if the Duke <HI>de Vendo&s;me</HI>
&s;hould attack him in <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he mu&s;t be
obliged to kill all the Hor&s;es, and &s;alt them up
for the Garri&s;ons Provi&s;ion, or &s;tarve; And
<PB N="22" REF="21">
that if a Supply of Provi&s;ions &s;hould be &s;en$
him, unle&s;s he had Troops al&s;o to encamp
without the Walls, the Hor&s;e mu&s;t all be &s;hip|ped
for <HI>Minorca,</HI> or they would eat one ano|ther,
&s;ince it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed the Maga|zines
of Forrage, nece&s;&s;ary for their Sub&s;i&s;tence
in a Siege, could he pre&s;erv'd from the Ene|mies
Bombs.</P>
<P>It is true that a general An&s;wer to this In|quiry
is given by &s;aying, That to pu&s;h the Wa$
in <HI>Flanders</HI> effectually, is to reduce <HI>France</HI> to a
Nece&s;&s;ity of evacuating <HI>Spain;</HI> that the Road
to <HI>Madred</HI> lies thro' the Gates of <HI>Paris;</HI> and that
as this is the only Step which reduced the King
of <HI>France</HI> to make &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions as he has
already made, &s;o it is a Proof that there is an
effectual Method to bring him to a Nece&s;&s;ity
of giving up all the re&s;t. This indeed has been
the popular Rea&s;on given for carrying on the
War &s;o long as it has been; and is the Argu|ment
now made u&s;e of to ju&s;tify the Breaking
o$f of the La&s;t Treaty, when <HI>France</HI> came in
to the evacuating <HI>Spain,</HI> and offer'd a Sum of
Money towards carrying on the War again&s;t
King <HI>Philip</HI> if he in&s;i&s;ted upon his Refu&s;al to
quit it: But whether, when we talk of the&s;e
things with &s;o much A&s;&s;urance, we are not a
little guilty of what in our Enemies we call <HI>The
Ga$conade,</HI> ought al&s;o to be con&s;ider'd; &s;ince,
in&s;tead of being at the Gates of <HI>Paris,</HI> we have
<PB N="23" REF="22">
pa&s;s'd another <HI>Campaign</HI> with taking one Pal|try
Town; have lo&s;t a &s;mall Army by De&s;er|tion
of our Troops. And tho' in <HI>Spain</HI> we have
&s;ent above 20000 Men for Succours to King
<HI>Charles,</HI> they are now in&s;ulted in their Intrench|ments,
and are not able to act upon the Offen|&s;ive
in any one Article.</P>
<P>So that the&s;e People &s;eem to be over forward
in giving the Kingdoms of <HI>Spain</HI> out of the Po&s;|&s;ion
of K. <HI>Philip</HI> by a Trea$y&punc; while they do not
fir&s;t tell us how we &s;hall get it out of his hand
by a War.</P>
<P>Nor do they con&s;ider the Confederates as in
the lea&s;t weaken'd or exhau&s;ted by the War. I
care not to &s;ay in publick, what I think of our
Difficulties, and how ill able we are in this Na|tion
to carry on the War any farther; but it
need not be an Offence to any one to have it
&s;aid, That the <HI>French</HI> are not the only Nation
in <HI>Europe</HI> who &s;tand in need of a Peace, e&s;pe|cially
as Matters go at home; which leads me
by the Hand to an Ob&s;ervation of an unhappy
Circum&s;tance in <HI>England,</HI> which more parti|cularly
ju&s;tifies tho&s;e who appear earne&s;t for a
Peace (<HI>viz.</HI>) That tho&s;e very People who ap|pear
mo&s;t forward again&s;t a Peace, and &s;eem

the very People who, by di&s;couraging Loans,

this is a Sugge&s;tion not yet proved, it cannot
receive a particular An&s;wer: But this might
&s;erve to &s;top the Mouth of that Sugge&s;tion:
Suppo&s;e the &s;ame Agent <HI>was once</HI> entertain'd

are entring into an Un&s;afe, Inglorious, Di&s;ho|nourable
Peace; that we will give up <HI>Spain,</HI>
which is the thing we have been fighting &s;o
long for: That to give <HI>Spain</HI> to King <HI>Philip</HI> is
giving it to King <HI>Lewis;</HI> and that to give it to

King of <HI>Spain,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion in
<HI>Germany:</HI> The Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> had made &s;e|veral
Decrees and Re&s;olutions, to the Prejudice
of the <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> which occa&s;ioned the famous
Treaty of <HI>Smalcalde,</HI> in the Year 1546. The
Emperour held a Dyet at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> where he
propo&s;ed that the <HI>Protestants</HI> &s;hould &s;ubmit to
the Decrees of the Council of <HI>Trent;</HI> which they
refu&s;ed and the Emperour taking upon him; the
<HI>Cru&s;ado,</HI> as it might well be called, Arms again&s;t
them. The War begun with great Fury, and
the <HI>Protestants</HI> at the Battel of <HI>Mulbergh</HI> were
ruin'd in it; the Great Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> taken, and

Healed in the famous Treaty of <HI>Westphalta.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for the giving <HI>Spain</HI> to the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Auctria,</HI> come we now to Enquire into the
probable Con&s;equences of giving the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Monarchy to <HI>Philip</HI> V. who now Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it.
<PB N="23" REF="39">
It is not for me to &s;ay, that by a War we may&punc;
or may not recover it from him, in &s;pight of all
the Oppo&s;ition both he and his Grandfather
can make, I will not doubt our future Succe&s;s
any more than we have had rea&s;on to doubt
our pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But if after we &s;hould have done this, and
have brought the King of <HI>France</HI> to con&s;ent en|tirely
to an Evacuation, we &s;hould then find
it as dangerous to give it to the Per&s;on we con|quer
it for, as to leave it with the Per&s;on we
have conquered it from; what account &s;hall
we give either to God or our Po&s;terity for the
Blood and Trea&s;ure &s;pent in this War?</P>
<P>This is an Argument which will at lea&s;t make
it worth our while to con&s;ider, as we go on,
what we are doing, or rather before we go on,
what we are going about: And this I really take
to be the true Rea&s;on why the pre&s;ent Govern|ment
of this Nation are for a Treaty at this
time; and I mu&s;t acknowledge it is a Te&s;ti|mony
to me beyoud any I have &s;een, that the
Per&s;ons now at the Helm go upon Principles of
Ju&s;tice and Prudence; if I Wrong them I &s;hall
be very &s;orry for their own &s;akes; I am &s;ure I
do not flatter them.</P>
<P>If, when we &s;hould have conquer'd <HI>Spain,</HI> it
may not be &s;afe to give it up into the hands we
fight for: For God's &s;ake, Good People, what
do we make War for? Is this Nation &s;o rich,
<PB N="41" REF="40">
&s;o great, &s;o at ea&s;e, that we want to make war
meerly to &s;pend our Money and de&s;troy our
Men! Shall we fight for <HI>Spain</HI> to give it back
again to them we take it from? It is much more
to the purpo&s;e to con&s;ider this before-hand.</P>
<P>It &s;eems plain from what has been &s;aid, it
may be very hazardous to give it to the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Austria;</HI> let us then inquire if it may be &s;afe
to give it to him that has it.</P>
<P>The Objections are confin'd to the&s;e two; 1.
He is an Heir, tho' remote to the Crown of
<HI>France,</HI> and may come to be Next Heir. 2. He
is in the Intere&s;t of <HI>France;</HI> and to give it to him
is to give it to <HI>France.</HI> For the fir&s;t of the&s;e,
That he is an Heir; it is &s;o remote, that it is
really not worth mentioning, &s;ince his Elder
Brother is alive, and has a Son alive, and his
Wife with Child young and breeding more.
To which may be added no Doubt, a Renun|ciation
in Favour of his younger Brother the
Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> And tho' 'tis true, the Renun|ciation
of Kingdoms is not e&s;teemed very &s;igni|ficant
in Princes, who have power to act again&s;t
them; and this might be a good Argument from
<HI>France</HI> to <HI>Spain;</HI> yet it will hardly hold in arguing
from <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e there is not equal
Danger from a Weak Prince and Kingdom to a
Strong, as there is from a Stronger to a Weak|er.
Again; as K. <HI>Philip</HI> has a Son, there is no
room for a Sugge&s;tion of a like nature in the
<PB N="42" REF="41">
Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The next, and indeed the only Argument of
Weight, is that of Intere&s;t, thus; That the
Obligations of K. <HI>Philip</HI> to the K. of <HI>France</HI> are
indi&s;&s;oluble: &s;uch as, be&s;ides the Ties of Na|ture,
the Obligation of owing his Crown to
him, as he not made him King only, but twice
replac'd him there when driven away by his
Enemies; and indeed the carrying on a War
principally for him, at the Expence of &s;o many
Millions, and in a Kind at the Hazard of his
whole Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I will freely own the&s;e are deep Debts,
&s;trong Obligations; and in Honour and Gra|titude
K. <HI>Ph$lip</HI> cannot but be in the Intere&s;t
of his Grandfather as long as he lives. But
let us inquire here into &s;ome things, which may
take off the Force of the&s;e Obligations, as to
the Argument before us</P>
<P>1. In a Treaty to e&s;tabli&s;h K. <HI>Philip,</HI> may not
&s;uch Limitations, Provi&s;ions, and Re&s;trictions,
be made, <HI>and that with the Con&s;ent of</HI> France,
as may for the future make K. <HI>Philip</HI> entirely
dependant upon the Allies, and independant
upon <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>2. Will not the K. of <HI>France,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h his
Grand&s;on, rather give him up &s;o far to the Con|federates,
as to make him their entire Ally and
Confederate, than not give him a quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of his Kingdom?</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">
3. A firm Peace being e&s;tabli&s;hed between
the 3 Crowns, may not this be &s;o far from an
Injury to <HI>France,</HI> that it will &s;eem to pre&s;erve
that Alliance and Peace, if <HI>France</HI> be at all &s;in|cere
in making it?</P>
<P>4. May not this Dependance of <HI>Spain</HI> upon
the Confederates, con&s;i&s;t &s;o much in the pre&s;er|ving
and &s;upporting <HI>Spain</HI> in the peaceable Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of all its remote Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from any In|vader,
as well <HI>German,</HI> or even hereafter of
<HI>French,</HI> as may make it the Advantage of <HI>Spain</HI>
to continue it.</P>
<P>Again in a Treaty to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>Philip</HI> V.
may not &s;uch Securities be given to <HI>Britain</HI> and
<HI>Holland,</HI> for the Safety of their Commerce, as
may put them out of Danger of any Encroach|ment
from <HI>France,</HI> and will not King <HI>Philip</HI> find
it his Intere&s;t, to give tho&s;e Securities.</P>
<P>Some Ob&s;ervations on this Head of Trade
may explain this.</P>
<P>1. It is mo&s;t certain, that the National In|tere&s;t
of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> can never Unite, by
National Intere&s;t are under&s;tood.</P>
<P>1. Tho&s;e of Dominion.</P>
<P>2. Tho&s;e of Commerce.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of Dominion are too many and too
long to mention here, and re&s;pect the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> where it can
never be the Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> to let <HI>France</HI> &s;et
her Foot, but of that I cannot enlarge here.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
Only I may &s;ay, that as two Kingdoms, they
will be ever Jealous of one another in both the&s;e
Places, nor will the relative Obligation la&s;t a
Moment longer than the Life of the pre&s;ent
King of <HI>France,</HI> for Intere&s;t of State always pre|vails
again&s;t Intere&s;t of Blood, and Brothers
will no longer agree, than their Governments
agree.</P>
<P>But, come we next to the Intere&s;t of Com|merce,
and here we know, let King <HI>Plilip</HI> de|&s;ire,
or de&s;ign what he will, the People of <HI>Spain</HI>
can never, nay the Government of <HI>Spain</HI> can
never either agree with <HI>France,</HI> or differ with
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>1. The <HI>French</HI> in Trade can do nothing to
engage <HI>Spain,</HI> nor any thing but to injure and
impoveri&s;h her. This appears in two Things.
<HI>Fir&s;t, France</HI> cannot take off any one thing of
the Produce of <HI>Spain,</HI> which is con&s;iderable. The
Wine, the Brandy, the Oil, the Fruit of <HI>Spain,</HI>
with which &s;o great a Trade is driven to <HI>En|gland</HI>
and <HI>Holland;</HI> in <HI>France</HI> it mu&s;t all go to
the Dunghill, they could not tell what el&s;e to
do with it&punc; even the Wool, they can in <HI>France</HI>
make u&s;e but of a very &s;mall Part of it. But as to
Wine, Oil, Fruit <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Southern Part of
<HI>France</HI> abound with them, and &s;upply almo&s;t
all the re&s;t of this Part of the World.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>French</HI> taking the Liberty of Trade
to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies,</HI> is a Grievance <HI>Spain</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="44">
it &s;elf will never bear; and <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t give it
up, or I que&s;tion much, if <HI>Philip</HI> could ever
maintain him&s;elf upon his Throne, even <HI>Spain</HI>
it &s;elf would fly in his Face, and fly to the Con|federates
for help to di&s;lodge them.</P>
<P>The&s;e two things, if there were no other,
will make <HI>Philip</HI> as much a <HI>Spaniard</HI> in one
Year after a Peace, as he is by the Nece&s;&s;ity
of the War a <HI>French-man</HI> now: perhaps indeed
Duty and the Debt above mentioned, may
tend to pre&s;erve a Deference and Regard from
King <HI>Philip</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> during the Life of his
Grandfather; and how far will this carry him,
truly only to repre&s;ent in Civil and obliging
Dutiful Terms, what his Subjects in&s;i&s;t on, and
to reque&s;t his Grandfather to make him ea&s;y on
the Throne, he exalted him to, by keeping up
the Boundaries of the Nations from any En|crochments,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> may not com|plain,
that in&s;tead of being Subjects to a King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> they are Va&s;&s;als to, and dependent u|pon
a King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But if there be any Occa&s;ion for any Thing
of this kind, after the Decea&s;e of the pre&s;ent King
of <HI>France,</HI> and King <HI>Philip</HI> comes to &s;olicite the&s;e
things of his Brother, <HI>Lewis</HI> XV. he will then
talk in another Stile, Demand them of Right, in|&s;i&s;t
upon the Demand, and do him &s;elf Ju&s;tice
if deny'd; if the <HI>French</HI> &s;hall re&s;ent it, and at|tempt
to force him to any Compli$nce; What
<PB N="46" REF="45">
then? He immediately has recour&s;e to <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;o you are as you were in the
World.</P>
<P>The Sum of this Matter is, we have nothing
to do, but to tye up <HI>France</HI> to Securities again&s;t
Encroachments, and upon who? not upon the
Confederates, for that will be &s;ufficiently &s;ecu|red
by Surrender of Towns, Barriers, and Fron|tiers;
but again&s;t Encroachment upon <HI>Spain,</HI> that
King <HI>Philip</HI> may be a free Prince, entirely Indepen|dent
upon <HI>France,</HI> and then leave the Intere&s;t of
his Kingdom to Work the re&s;t. There is no
Room left to argue it, the Natural Con&s;equences
of his being King of <HI>Spain,</HI> will be, that he &s;hall
be an Enemy to <HI>France,</HI> the National Intere&s;ts of
the Two Kingdoms are Incompatible and can|not
be Reconciled, they never were, they never
can be brought to Con&s;i&s;t with one another.</P>
<P>It might be expected, that I &s;hould add the
natural Antipathies of the People, which in all
things, have &s;o &s;eparated the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the
<HI>French,</HI> that the Aver&s;ions which proceed from
thence, are con&s;iderably In&s;trumental in propa|gating
a Separation of Intere&s;t. But I do not
think this &s;o material an Article as &s;ome People
imagin, the Policy of <HI>France,</HI> may go a great way
to Naturalize the Nations one to another, and to
remove tho&s;e Natural Aver&s;ions, introducing
them&s;elves gradually, and bringing the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
off by Art and Management from their Stiffne&s;s
<PB N="47" REF="46">
and Formalities, and by little and little, accu&s;to|ming
them to the Manners and Fa&s;hions of their
Neighbours. I do not therefore lay &s;o great
Stre&s;s upon the natural Antipathies of the <HI>French</HI>
and <HI>Spaniards</HI> one to another, as &s;ome People do;
at the &s;ame time, I do not deny, but &s;uch things
may Influence &s;omething in this Ca&s;e, and &s;way
the People by their Inclination with the more
readine&s;s to fall in with their real Intere&s;t, when
it &s;uits their National Temper as much as it
does their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But when we come to &s;peak of the Political
and Real Intere&s;t of a Nation, the Article of In|clination
and Temper in the People, is a thing &s;o
trifling, as it need have no Influence in the Ca&s;e.
The Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> as to Trade, can never agree
with that of <HI>France.</HI> The Latter indeed may a|gree
with the Former, <HI>France</HI> may gain by a
Trade with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as they make a hap|py
return of Plate, Bullion, and Ready Money,
for what they carry to <HI>Spain;</HI> but <HI>Spain</HI> would
&s;tarve, and $e undone.</P>
<P>The only advantageous Trade <HI>Spain</HI> can drive
in the World, out of them&s;elves, is to <HI>England</HI>
and to <HI>Holland:</HI> Hither they export 30000 Pipes
of <HI>Canary,</HI> 5000 Butts of <HI>Sherry,</HI> and 10000 Pipes
of <HI>Tent, Alicant, Malaga,</HI> and <HI>Barcelona</HI> Wines, a
year: Hither they load a va&s;t Quantity of Oil, of
Fruit, of <HI>Indico,</HI> and of Cocheneal, which <HI>France</HI>
can do little in, or take little or nothing of.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47" MS="Y">
If then in the Treaty making, or to be made,
<HI>France</HI> can offer any Securities again&s;t undue En|croachments
upon the Commerce of <HI>Spain,</HI> in
order to give a new turn to the Advantage of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>If our Commerce thither can be &s;ecured in
its Native Cour&s;e and Freedom without Inter|ruption,
Partiality, and Impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If Civil Encroachments are provided again&s;t
in the Government of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>
kept out of the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies.</HI></P>
<P>If all the&s;e things can be adju&s;ted with <HI>France,</HI>
and every thing le$t to its Native Channel, there
is no need for us to be alarm'd at the giving <HI>Spain</HI>
and the <HI>Indies</HI> to K. <HI>Philip:</HI> For the Intere&s;t of
Trade, of Government, and of Policy, will all
run again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> the Nation will be as much
ours as ever; and K. <HI>Philip</HI> and his Po&s;terity be
as much <HI>Spaniards</HI> in a very &s;hort time as ever
<HI>Philip</HI> II. was, or any of his other Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
