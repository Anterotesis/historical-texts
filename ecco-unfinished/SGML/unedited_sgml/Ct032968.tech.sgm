<P>YOur Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Loyal, Dutiful, and always
Faithful Subjects, the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in
Ireland, could never &s;o well demon&s;trate either
their profound Duty to your Per&s;on, and Regard to your
Repo&s;e, or their own mo&s;t heavy Pre&s;&s;ure of Mind under
the melancholly Con&s;ideration of being incapacitated for your
Maje&s;ty's Service by any Method, as by the Dutiful Si|lence
and Entire Submi&s;&s;ion they have always &s;hown to your
Government, and the Laws.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
They have no more been Clamarous with their Complaints,
than di&s;obedient in their Practice, although under the ter|rible,
and Pardon them, <HI>Madam,</HI> if they think, unde&s;erv'd
Mortification, of being joined with your Maje&s;ty's Capital
Enemies, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts; and enacted again&s;t in a Bill
for the Publick Security of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>As nothing could have been more de&s;ireable to them than
to &s;ee Your Maje&s;ty's Crown and Government &s;ecur'd by an
intire &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Popery in this Nation, &s;o nothing could
have been more agreeable to them than to hear of a Bill de|pending
in your Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Honourable Privy Council,
pre&s;ented by your Faithful and Dutiful Commons of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
for the more effectual Security of Your Maje&s;ty, and this
Nation, by preventing the Growth of Popery.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Madam,</HI> as it mu&s;t needs be the remote&s;t thing in
the World from their Thoughts, that they could be any way
concern'd in &s;uch a Bill, other than to reap in Common,
with the re&s;t of your Maje&s;ty's Loyal Subjects, the Securities
and Advantages of it; &s;o nothing could be more &s;urprizing,
as well as afflicting, than to find them&s;elves rank'd with tho&s;e
People, whom, they pre&s;ume, your Maje&s;ty is well a&s;&s;ur'd
they have always been earne&s;t to oppo&s;e; and at the Ex|pence
of their Blood and Fortunes have a&s;&s;i&s;ted your Maje|&s;tys
Royal Predece&s;&s;ors again&s;t upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>It cannot be that your Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting
Subjects of <HI>Ireland</HI> can be guilty of any thing to entitle them
to &s;uch &s;evere Mortifications, &s;ince tho' they have the &V;n|happine&s;s
to differ in &s;ome Opinions from your Majety's Sen|timents,
and the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church; yet as they value
them&s;elves upon the Te&s;timonies graciou&s;ly given them by
your Maje&s;ty's Ance&s;tors of their &s;teady and un&s;haken Loy|alty
to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and your Maje&s;ty's Royal
Family, &s;o they humbly pre&s;ume to appeal to their Profe&s;|&s;ions
of Faith, in Matters of Religion, as well as to
<PB REF="4">
their Constant Practice, to determine whether they have
always adhered to Principles equally Orthodox in Doctrine,
and equally contrary to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with, the Errors
and Ab&s;urdities of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>As Your Maje&s;ty's Royal Re&s;olution to protect the Pro|te&s;tant
Intere&s;t without Di&s;tinction is known to the World,
&s;o your equal Conduct to all your Subjects gives an univer&s;al
Satisfaction, that your Royal Judgment knows perfectly to
execute by the mo&s;t proper Methods what your Goodne&s;s hath
fir&s;t determined to be rea&s;onable; and as this is the Joy of
all your People, &s;o <HI>Madam,</HI> your Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting Sub|jects
in <HI>Ireland</HI> are too &s;en&s;ible of the Ble&s;&s;ing, and know
too well both their Duty and Intere&s;t, to do any thing to
forfeit their Share in it.</P>
<P>Nor can they doubt, but as Your Maje&s;ty's equal Regard
to all your Subjects is your Glory, &s;o it will be their Ad|vantage
always, enclining your Maje&s;ty to hear, and re|dre&s;s
the Pre&s;&s;ures and Complaints of any Part of your Go|vernment,
cru&s;h'd by the Weight of Another; and humbly
laying them&s;elves and their Ca&s;e at Your Royal Feet, they
willingly wait the time when God &s;hall move Your Royal
Heart to that Goodne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s which the true Mo|ther
extended to the Child when the Dreadful Arm was
&s;tretcht out to divide it.</P>
<P>In the Confidence of this, they heartily pray for Your
Maje&s;ty's unvalluable Life and Pro&s;perity, and earne&s;tly
wi&s;h and de&s;ire the whole Body of Prote&s;tants in the&s;e Na|tions,
for the Security of their Intere&s;ts, and of Your Ma|je&s;ty's
Government, would obey the Glorious Invitation to
Peace and &V;nion, which Your Majesty has &s;o often made to
all your Subjects, by which we might all joyn in your Ser|vice
to the Glory of the Protestant Religion, the entire
Satisfaction of Your Majesty, and the Peace and Pro&s;perity
of the&s;e unhappy divided Nations.</P>

<HEAD>THE
PARALLEL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE Gentlemen who wrote with &s;o much vigor in the Ca&s;e
of Occa&s;ional Conformity, had mo&s;t effectually clench'd their
Arguments, and overthrown all the Pretences of the Diffenters
again&s;t an Occa&s;ional Bill, could they, as they undertook,
ha' made it out, That <HI>in all wi&s;e Nations it has been the Practice to Exclude
all &s;uch as are not of the national Church from any &s;hare in the Admini&s;tration
of Publick Affairs.</HI></P>
<P>But as the good or bad Effects of Exclu&s;ive Laws may be mo&s;t clearly di&s;|covered
in Ca&s;es where the Sea&s;ons, Methods, Per&s;ons, Intere&s;ts and Cir|cum&s;tances,
run in the mo&s;t exact Parallel, I &s;hall beg leave to pa&s;s by th'
exploded Arguments, drawn from the Practi&s;e of Nations abroad, for
excluding from the Management of Publick Affairs all who are not of their
National Church, and bring up a Precedent near home in the Kingdom of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> where the re&s;emblance of a Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity, in
its charitable Expedients and flouri&s;hing Con&s;equences, may teach tho&s;e who
de&s;ire the like in <HI>England</HI> to look over among their Neighbours and &s;ee the
Con&s;equences of it upon the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>'Tis very probable the Gentlemen concern'd in that Project for <HI>Ireland,</HI>
would never have pu&s;h'd at it if they had not thought at the &s;ame time
&s;omething equivalent in <HI>England</HI> would have pa&s;t; for they would not
have been &s;o acce&s;&s;ary to di&s;covering the real De&s;ign, they would not
have been willing the cloven Foot &s;hould have been &s;een &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P><HI>&V;nhappy</HI> Ireland! Thou art always bound to be ruin'd to &s;ave thy
Neighbours; How was thy Ma&s;&s;acre in Forty-one a flaming Beacon to Il|luminate
the World, and tell <HI>England</HI> what was coming upon her! Giv|ing
her timely notice to take care of her &s;elf, and leading the way to her
&s;afety with the Blood of 200000 innocent betray'd Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>In our la&s;t unhappy Popi&s;h Reign how was this Kingdom &s;wallowed up
with Tyranny, and made a Sacrifice to <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Politicks; en|tirely
devour'd and over run by the Arbitrary Methods of that Time?
How was Tyranny and Popery Hand in Hand Introduc'd, and the Laws
and Liberties of Prote&s;tants trod under Foot, <HI>as a fair Introduction to the
&s;ame Method putting forward in</HI> England, but not &s;o ea&s;ily brought to pa&s;s,
and con&s;equently as a fair Notice to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People to fortifie them|&s;elves
again&s;t that Flood of De&s;truction which they had &s;een overflow
their Unfortunate Neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6">
Now thou art &s;et a third time as a Mark, a Buoy on the cover'd Rock,
a Notice of concealed Mi&s;chiefs, a warning Piece to all the Prote&s;tant World,
but particularly as a Plan of a De&s;ign laid for the De&s;truction both of the
Liberties, Civil Rights and Religious Privileges of thy Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;en|ting
Nighbours.</P>
<P>In all Ca&s;es; and on all Occa&s;ions, when the Ruin and De&s;truction of
<HI>England</HI> has been de&s;ign'd, <HI>Ireland</HI> has <HI>thus gone before her;</HI> &s;ome that are
wi&s;er in Politicks than I can pretend to, give this for a Rea&s;on, That the
Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t being weaker in this Kingdom than in that, the en|croaching
Party has not been oblig'd to &s;uch Cautions, and &s;uch nice Mea|&s;ures
here as they have there, and the Project has been &s;ooner ripe; but
they have been very happily defeated in their grand De&s;ign, by their own
Forwardne&s;s in that part of it, the fir&s;t Execution in that Ca&s;e opening the
Scene &s;o early, that Nation has always been allarum'd from hence, and
found occa&s;ion to remember the old Rule in the Accidence, <HI>Faelix quem
Facient, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And thus in the fatal In&s;tances given, <HI>England</HI> always took warning
from her Si&s;ter <HI>Ireland;</HI> in 1641, when the bloody Papi&s;ts Ma&s;&s;acred &s;o ma|ny
thou&s;and Prote&s;tants in <HI>Ireland,</HI> it immediately allarm'd the whole <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Nation, and told then in Characters too plain not to be read by the
meane&s;t Under&s;tanding, what <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men were to expect from the Pre|dominacy
of the &s;ame Party, and con&s;equently that it was high time to
Arm again&s;t the Encroachments of Popery at home, to prevent the &s;ame
De&s;truction they had &s;een happen to their Neighbours here in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>In 1688, when the Methods of Arbitrary Power, and the Popi&s;h De|&s;igns
went on &s;o fa&s;t in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the whole Kingdom appeared in a
manner &s;ubjugated to the Power of the Princes Will, and prepared to be
either Papi&s;ts or Slaves, or both. The forward Ruin of their Liberties,
and the vi&s;ible De&s;truction of the Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>Ireland, like the
Drum to the Battail,</HI> awakned the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation to their own Delive|rance,
and rouz'd them to con&s;ider, That the only Rea&s;on why they were
not reduced to the &s;ame Condition with their unhappy Neighbours was, be|cau&s;e
the Enemies Power was not yet arrived to a pitch of Capacity; and
that the De&s;ign was the &s;ame, tho' the End was remoter there, as their
Work had more difficulty.</P>
<P>The Third Article is now before us, <HI>equally Ruinous</HI> in its Con&s;equences
and <HI>equally Exemplar;</HI> and in this they keep &s;till to the former Method,
That we are always Ruin'd a &s;tep before <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis confe&s;t the Contrivers of the&s;e Religious Di&s;turbances managed their
Matters &s;o as to have the blow &s;truck in both Kingdoms at the &s;ame Time,
and &s;o have prevented the Mi&s;chief in one Place being a Warning to the
other: But Providence that has ever watch'd over the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t
broke the Snare, and unravel'd all this knot of Mi&s;ery, and &s;till poor <HI>Ire|land</HI>
is the Beacon to warn us, the Allarm to rouze us, and the Example
from which to beware.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore worth &s;ome Remark here, that the &s;pecious Pretences
made in both Kingdoms to cover and conceal the real De&s;ign, have been
equally contriv'd, tho' not equally &s;ucce&s;sful. In <HI>Ireland</HI> a Clau&s;e to ruin
the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, and in Effect the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, by di&s;cou|raging
and di&s;contenting a great part of the Prote&s;tants in that Kingdom,
comes introduc'd under the Title of <HI>an Act to prevent the Growth of Po|pery.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">
'Tis not material to Enquire by who&s;e Application or &s;ecret Manage|ment
this Mi&s;chief was accompli&s;h'd; nor is it the De&s;ign of this Paper
to make Per&s;onal Reflections.</P>
<P>But it cannot but be ob&s;erv'd, that it &s;eems &s;omething hard, and very
unkind, that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who were known to be one of the
chief Bulwarks in that Kingdom again&s;t Popery, and who were in general
a People who at the Price of their Blood defended them&s;elves to the la&s;t
Extremity, and kept a footing in <HI>Ireland</HI> till Relief could come from <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
&s;hould by the Artifice, and for the private Ends of a Party, who
have not yet told us what they drive at, be rank'd in the &s;ame Cla&s;s with the
Introducers <HI>of that Popery</HI> they laid down their Lives to oppo&s;e, and be
coupled with the mo&s;t dangerous Enemies of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>At be&s;t it &s;avours of a mo&s;t &s;candalous Ingratitude, That the very Peo|ple
who drank deepe&s;t of the Popi&s;h Fury, and that were the mo&s;t vigor|ous
to &s;hew both their Zeal and their Courage, in oppo&s;ing Tyranny and
Popery, and on the Foot of who&s;e Forwardne&s;s and Valour, the Church
of <HI>Ireland</HI> recovered her &s;elf from the low Condition Popery had reduc'd
her to, &s;hould now be requited with &s;o injurious a Treatment as to be
link'd with tho&s;e very Papi&s;ts they fought again&s;t, and be Enacted again&s;t
under the Head of <HI>preventing the Growth of Popery.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that this Bill was pa&s;&s;ing in <HI>Ireland,</HI> great Boa&s;ts were
made by &s;ome People, of a Bill on foot in <HI>England,</HI> for the further en|forcing
the Te&s;t Act by preventing the <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> of Di&s;|&s;enters.</P>
<P>The Advocates for this Bill have had a great deal of trouble to defend
it from &s;ome Scandals thrown upon it by other Pens, As that it was a
Breach of <HI>To$eration,</HI> a De&s;ign of <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> and an Encroachment on
Civil as well as Religious <HI>Right.</HI> Whether it has been clear'd of the&s;e
Charges is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this Paper; and yet if my Opinion were to
be ask'd in this Ca&s;e, I believe I &s;hould &s;ay, that both Per&s;ecution and
Encroachments on Civil Liberties, was actually expected by &s;ome that
built their Hopes on the Succe&s;s of this Bill.</P>
<P>Why &s;ome Gentlemen took care to put out of the Preamble to the &s;econd
Bill the Declaration again&s;t Per&s;ecution, is a My&s;tery I wont undertake to
explain; but that it afforded various Speculations to us without Doors is
as certain, as that after it was &s;o left out, &s;ome People began to le&s;|&s;en
their Diligence in Exploding Per&s;ecuting Principles.</P>
<P>The Language of tho&s;e Gentlemen without Doors, who at fir&s;t were
only for re&s;training a vicious Practice as they call'd it, was
&s;oon alter'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;&s;andra. Sachevrel.</NOTE> and the Pulpit and the Pre&s;s throng'd with In|vectives

<P>I&s;hall not direct the World to judge of one thing by another, but where
Parallels are drawn very exact, what &s;hall we &s;ay when two Things are
acted at the &s;ame Time, by the &s;ame Per&s;ons, in the &s;ame Methods, and
the Subject exactly the &s;ame, who &s;hall doubt the &s;amene&s;s of the De+&s;ign.</P>

<P>What can the large&s;t Charity think is in the bottom of all this, when
we &s;ee a Party in Travel with a mon&s;trous Birth? In <HI>England</HI> the Tole|ration

be treated as Men mo&s;t dangerous and &s;u&s;pected, notwith&s;tanding their
Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, &s;o con&s;picuous in the defence of that Coun|try.
When Men &s;train their Rea&s;on to reconcile &s;uch Contradictions,
we may expect the Birth will di&s;clo&s;e &s;omething which at pre&s;ent they
would be loath to own as legitimate. No Men &s;trech their Rea&s;on and

<P>It cannot be that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who of all the People of
that Nation ventur'd with the greate&s;t Ob&s;tinacy and Re&s;olution to defend
their Country, and the Prote&s;tant Religion again&s;t Popery, can be con|cern'd
in a Bill <HI>to prevent the Growth of Popery;</HI> &s;uch Contradictions mu&s;t be
big with &s;ome other Birth; there mu&s;t be &s;ome Plot again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters
<HI>as &s;uch,</HI> and the hedging them into an Act for <HI>preventing the Growth of Po|pery,</HI>
mu&s;t be either a meer Indignity put upon them to render them O|dious
and Contemptible to the World, or a Fraud, a Concealment to blind
the Eyes of the Di&s;&s;enters that it might pa&s;s without their Notice, &s;ince
no one could imagine it could be po&s;&s;ible an Act to <HI>prevent the Growth of
Popery</HI> could have any thing in it that could affect the Di&s;&s;enters, than
whom none were more violent again&s;t Popery on all Occa&s;ions, or more
ready to expo&s;e them&s;elves for the defence of their Country and the Pro|te&s;tant
Religion.</P>
<P>But however unkind or my&s;terious this Matter is, &s;o it appears; and in
order to lay open the Ca&s;e, &s; as to let the World judge of it, and to make
out the Hard&s;hips, which with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our Superiors, we think the

<P><PB N="5" REF="9">
1. As to the Matter of Fact, the &s;hort Abridgment of it is as follows.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants in <HI>Ireland</HI> had many Years laboured under the Encroach|ments
of the Papi&s;ts, they had been once mo&s;t horridly Ma&s;&s;acred to the
number of 200000, and the re&s;t Plundred and driven from their Settle|ments
and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Year 1641.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t War they ran a Fate equal to the fir&s;t, <HI>the Ma&s;&s;acre except|ed,</HI>
and <HI>as will be farther ob&s;erved,</HI> in the&s;e Extremities, the little City of
<HI>Derry</HI> was the only place of Refuge for the Prote&s;tants, and a Sanctuary
which the Papi&s;ts could never drive them out of with all their Force, and
where they found &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance as gave all the World rea&s;on <HI>to know,</HI> that
the aver&s;ion between the Di&s;&s;enters and the Papi&s;ts was as con&s;tant as
great, and as irreconcilable as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;erved to encrea&s;e the Won|der,
That the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould, of all People in the World, be look'd upon
as Per&s;ons in the &s;ame Cla&s;s <HI>with the Papi&s;ts,</HI> and Enacted again&s;t in a Bill
prevent <HI>the Growth of Popery.</HI></P>
<P>In order to &s;ecure the Prote&s;tants from the like Erruptions of Popery,
&s;everal Bills had been offered in Parliament, to prevent the growth and
encrea&s;e of that Power that had been &s;o dangerous, and had &s;truck twice
at the Root of their Liberty and Religion.</P>
<P>But it had been the Misfortune of this Country to have &s;uch Bills, thro'
one unhappy Accident or other, always to mi&s;carry, either at home among
them&s;elves, or at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, where the Native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> always culti|vated
&s;uch an Intere&s;t as was too hard for the Prote&s;tants, and has been
a means to deprive them of the ble&s;&s;ing of &s;uch Bills.</P>
<P>The late Glorious King <HI>William,</HI> who, at the hazard of his Royal Per|&s;on,
was the &s;pecial In&s;trument of their &s;econd redemption from the pre|prevailing
Power of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> had &s;uch a peculiar Love for this Kingdom,
as the Triumph of his own immediate Conduct and Valour, that he al|ways
&s;tudied its Welfare, and was ready to give Ear to any Propo&s;al for
its advantage.</P>
<P>But as that Prince, who had upon his Thought the univer&s;al good of
Mankind, had no &s;ooner recovered one Kingdom from De&s;truction but
he had another upon his Hands; (his whole Reign being embarra&s;s'd
with the perpetual Cares of &s;erving Ungrateful Nations,) &s;o the Prote|&s;tants
found the Settlement of Affairs in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;o perplex'd, and the Re|a&s;&s;umation
of Grants ready to bring a new Difficulty on the Stage; and in
all this time they found no opportunity to offer at the Settlement and Se|curity
of their Intere&s;t and Religion, as they expected and de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>But when they &s;aw the Di&s;orders pretty well over, and the lo&s;s of their
glorious Benefactor &s;o happily &s;upply'd, by the Acce&s;&s;ion of her pre&s;ent
Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>When to their great Comfort and Satisfaction, they &s;aw the early Care
her Maje&s;ty took of all her Prote&s;tant Subjects, her Zeal for the Prote&s;tant
Religion, and the powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he prepared to give it in all parts of
<HI>Europe</HI> where &s;he &s;aw it oppre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>When they &s;aw them&s;elves ble&s;s'd with &s;uch a Lord Lieutenant, who by
'rea&s;on of his great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions among them, <HI>be&s;ides the Native Inclination,</HI>
his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond, always di&s;covered to acts of Genero&s;ity,</HI>
had powerful Obligations of Care and Re&s;pect upon him for the Kingdom
of <HI>Ireland</HI> in Particular; &s;uch a Governor as the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> always
lov'd and long'd for, and than whom, none ever was, or could be &s;ent thi|ther
<PB N="6" REF="10">
more Enclin'd or better prepared to Improve all her Maje&s;ty's gra|cious
Intentions of Good to the Kingdom, in the highe&s;t manner her Ma|je&s;ty
could de&s;ire or the People expect.</P>
<P>This, of all the critical Junctures that ever happen'd to this Kingdom,
&s;eem'd <HI>the happy opportunity,</HI> put into their Hands by a &s;pecial Providence,
to obtain the Settlement and Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion, which
they and their Ance&s;tors had &s;pent &s;o much Blood and Trea&s;ure to pro|cure,
and the want of which had been attended with &s;o many fatal Con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>In
order to this, among the &s;everal Bills pre&s;ented by the Parliament to
his Grace the Lieutenant, in the &s;econd Year of his Government, to be by
him tran&s;mitted to <HI>London,</HI> and to be pa&s;&s;ed in the Council there, <HI>accord|ing
to the Settlement,</HI> there was one particular Bill, Entituled, <HI>An Act to
prevent the Growth of Popery.</HI></P>
<P>That the greater &s;olemnity might add to the Value of it, and that it
might appear of what Con&s;equence the Parliament of <HI>Ireland</HI> thought this
Act, the Speaker, attended by the whole Hou&s;e, waited on the Lord Lieu|tenant
of <HI>Ireland</HI> to pre&s;ent this Bill, and in a particular manner recom|mended
it to his Care; at the &s;ame time acquainting his Grace, that
the Hou&s;e had &s;ufficient Grounds to believe the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts had rais'd a
Sum of Money in the Kingdom, to manage their Sollicitations again&s;t this
Bill, in order to prevent its return out of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>His Grace, to his Glory may it be remember'd, had that Care of the
Prote&s;tant Religion, that Concern for the good of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that &s;pe|cial
Regard for the Recommendation of the Parliament, that &s;ending the
Bill to <HI>England,</HI> and backing it with his powerful and hearty Sollicitations
at the Court of <HI>England,</HI> he prevented the Papi&s;ts; and notwith&s;tanding
the oppo&s;ition they made, obtained the Bill to be approv'd, and returned
to the un&s;peakable Joy, and no le&s;s Surprize of the whole Body of Pro|te&s;tants
in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But this Joy was exceedingly le&s;&s;en'd, when upon the reading the Bill
they found to their Amazement, among the Clau&s;es for &s;ecurity of
the Prote&s;tants and weakening the Power of Popery, a Clau&s;e put in to
oblige all the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that have any Place, Of|fice,
or Power from the Government, to conform to the Church of <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
and receive the Sacrament after the u&s;age thereof, or el&s;e to be Di&s;|abled
or Incapacitated for the Service of their Country.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants of the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who tho' they were zealous
for the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, were yet &s;en&s;ible of the Power of the Papi&s;ts,
and how u&s;eful on all Occa&s;ions the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters had been in help|ing
them to oppo&s;e Popery, were extremely concern'd at this; they
remember'd their Power, tho' united, had been twice too weak to re&s;i&s;t
the Papi&s;ts, and that therefore it was a mo&s;t unhappy piece of un&s;ea&s;on|able
Policy, to weaken the Church by depriving them of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
&s;o great a Body of Prote&s;tants, or at lea&s;t di&s;obliging them.</P>
<P>They fore&s;aw that this Clau&s;e would endanger the lo&s;s of the Bill, &s;ince
it would engage the Di&s;&s;enters with all their Intere&s;t to oppo&s;e it, as the
Papi&s;ts they were &s;ure already would do.</P>
<P>They fore&s;aw this Clau&s;e would allarm the Di&s;&s;enters, and make them
judge their faithful Services in the Siege of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> at <HI>Inniskilling</HI>
and other places ill rewarded, and break that Harmony which with &s;o
<PB N="7" REF="11">
much Charity and Tenderne&s;s had been reciprocally maintained between
Conformi&s;ts and Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>In Con&s;ideration of the&s;e things, almo&s;t all People were under great
Concern, and not a few thought it very unkind to the Di&s;&s;enters, and a
Requital of their faithful Services at the Siege of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> at <HI>Innis|killing,</HI>
and other places, in a manner very un&s;uitable to their Merits.</P>
<P>I choo&s;e to mention here the Concern the Conforming Prote&s;tants were
in at this Clau&s;e, not only to te&s;tifie their Zeal for the Bill of &s;ecurity a|gain&s;t
Popery, which they were afraid by this Clau&s;e would be lo&s;t, but
al&s;o to witne&s;s for them, as they had no hand in, nor any De&s;ign to bring
&s;uch a thing upon the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;o the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> has on many
Occa&s;ions expre&s;s'd, and at all times for above twenty Years pa&s;t practis'd,
all the Charity and Ea&s;ine&s;s to the di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tants that can be de|&s;ired
among Chri&s;tians; agreeing in all Capital Points of Religion, and
particularly embark'd in one and the &s;ame bottom of Intere&s;t and publick
Safety.</P>
<P>When this Bill came to be Read in the Hou&s;e, it met with particular
oppo&s;ition from the Papi&s;ts, who were heard by their Council, and who
pleaded the Articles of <HI>Limerick,</HI> &amp;c. and charged the Prote&s;tants with
breach of Faith and Capitulations.</P>
<P>The Clau&s;e again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters was oppos'd by &s;everal worthy Mem|bers
of the Prote&s;tant Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and a great many Learned
Speeches were made on that Head.</P>
<P>And not to pre&s;ume to publi&s;h a Relation of what was &s;aid by any par|ticular
Member, I am inform'd that near one hundred Gentlemen, all of
the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;poke with a great deal of Tenderne&s;s and Con|cern
for the Di&s;&s;enters as too hardly dealt with, and too much affected with
this Clau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters in the Hou&s;e were ob&s;erv'd to make little or no oppo&s;i|tion
in this Ca&s;e, but as the old Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> when being Attainted
in Parliament, the King refu&s;ing to &s;ign the Attainder, he gave his own
con&s;ent to have his Head cut off to fix the Peace between his Maje&s;ty and
his People; they choo&s;e rather to acquie&s;ce with an Unhappine&s;s laid on
them, and &s;uffer all the ill they &s;aw coming upon them, than let
&s;uch a Bill drop in the Hou&s;e, which they knew to be &s;o much wanted
again&s;t Popery, and which was of &s;uch a va&s;t Benefit to the &s;ecurity
of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in general, and the publick Quiet and Safety of
the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus they &s;acrific'd them&s;elves and their Brethren for the publick Good
of their Country, and were pa&s;&s;ive in their own Prejudices that the Bill
might not be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, on the other &s;ide, on no Con&s;ideration de&s;ir'd to
put the&s;e Hard&s;hips on the Di&s;&s;enters, but &s;aw them&s;elves oblig'd
to pa&s;s this Clau&s;e, or lo&s;e all the Advantages which were accruing
to them by the other, &s;o gave at la&s;t an unwilling A&s;&s;ent to the Bill,
publickly declaring their Re&s;olution <HI>To do &s;omething which &s;hould make
the Di&s;&s;enters as ea&s;ie as they are in</HI> England; and accordingly it
was Re&s;olv'd, <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> the very next Day, that Heads
of a Bill &s;hould be brought in to give the Di&s;&s;enters the &s;ame
Tolleration they enjoy in <HI>England;</HI> but the Se&s;&s;ions was &s;o near
a Conclu&s;&s;ion that there was not time for that Bill to be brought
in: And thus the Bill pa&s;s'd, and the Di&s;&s;enters are thereby ob|lig'd
<PB N="8" REF="12">
to conform to the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> or to quit all the Service of
their Country, and be turned out of every place of Tru&s;t or Profit in the
Nation.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort Ab&s;tract of the Fact as it now lies before us, the Con&s;e|quences
of this Act of Parliament, &s;o far as it affects the Di&s;&s;enters in the
Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> may be gue&s;t at from the following, Account of the
proceedings upon this Act in the North parts, and particularly in the City
of <HI>London-Derry.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> as is well known to all tho&s;e who are acquaint|ed
with <HI>Ireland,</HI> is chiefly Inhabited by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> and above two
Thirds of them by computation are Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>How they have always behav'd them&s;elves, both in Peace and War,
both to their Enemies and to their Neighbours, both to the Government
and for the Government, will be con&s;idered in an Article by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>How they have now been Treated, with re&s;pect to this Act, comes un|der
this Head, and will appear by the &s;urprizing Proceedings with the
Magi&s;trates of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and other places in <HI>&V;l&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>In this Tran&s;action its ob&s;ervable, how readily the very E&s;&s;ence of a
Party, Humour, Spleen and Forwardne&s;s, may be disfu&s;ed into the Minds
of Men, &s;ince notwith&s;tanding the Tenderne&s;s and Con&s;ideration of the
Enactors, yet the Execution has not been managed with the &s;ame Spirit.</P>
<P>By this Act they have put out mo&s;t of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace in the
Province of <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> for we do not hear of above one or two that have
Qualified them&s;elves and for want of Gentlemen that are qualified, have
been oblig'd to fill up the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace with Clergy-men;
where by the way it may be noted, That the Phanaticks in <HI>New England</HI>
are not the only People who make their Prie&s;ts Magi&s;trates, and have the
Law and the Go&s;pel under the management of the &s;ame Hand.</P>
<P>It was thought &s;trange, that in tho&s;e Counties they &s;hould be under Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Magi&s;trates, and the Men of the Gown have both the Word of
the Lord and the Sword <HI>of the State,</HI> in&s;tead of that of the <HI>Spirit</HI> to man|age,
and &s;o in <HI>Ireland</HI> it might be thought as &s;trange, that the antient In|habitants,
who &s;pent their Fortunes, and hazarded their Lives in Defence
of the whole Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, are now not thought worthy to Govern
what they &s;o gallantly defended; but as People not fit to be tru&s;ted
with that in Peace which they &s;aved in War, are laid by with Contempt,
and their places not being to be filled up with Men of equal Worth and
equal Figure, in part &s;upplied with Youths, Strangers, new Comers, and
Clergy-men; Men of little E&s;tates, and con&s;equently having not &s;o much
Obligation on them to be concerned for the Good of the place; Per&s;ons
that have little, if any thing, to recommend them to the Dignity of Ma|gi&s;trates
but their going to Church, with neither Fortunes, Intere&s;t or
Qualification.</P>
<P>How far the Government is concern'd, how far the Safety of the City,
how far the Service of her Maje&s;ty is advanc'd in this way of Proceedings,
Time, and the Con&s;equences of Things, mu&s;t determine, and avoiding any
Reflections on the probability, 'tis left to the publick Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>And &s;ince 'tis natural for all Per&s;ons, and even a Turk, that &s;ees a Nation
or a Party puni&s;h'd, exploded and unqualified by a Law would be ready to en|quire
what Crime they have been Guilty of, what Offence they have commit|ted
that &s;hould move the Government to throw them by as u&s;ele&s;s Per&s;ons,
di&s;mi&s;s them as People not fit to be tru&s;ted and employ'd, it obliges us to fall
<PB N="9" REF="13">
in with the &s;ame Enquiry, and &s;o go on with the &s;econd Head of this
Argument, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>2. Enquire into the Behaviour of the Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;ee what they
have done to de&s;erve &s;uch a Treatment, and what rea&s;on they have to
expect a better.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e it is the Cu&s;tom of all the Di&s;&s;enters Enemies in <HI>England,</HI>
who &s;eek for Matter to charge them with, to go back to the Years of 41
to 48 and 60, and to rake into the Follies and Misfortunes of former Ages
to &s;eek for Arguments to brand the pre&s;ent, <HI>a certain &s;ign</HI> the modern
Behaviour of the Di&s;&s;enters does not furni&s;h &s;ufficient Matter of
blame to ju&s;tifie their pre&s;ent Treatment; yet in the Ca&s;e of the
Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> we are as willing as they to go back to tho&s;e Times,
and &s;hould be plea&s;ed to join I&s;&s;ue with them in &s;earching out for the Re|bellions,
the A&s;&s;ociations, the Factions, and the Di&s;turbances the Di&s;&s;en|ters
in <HI>Ireland</HI> ever rai&s;ed again&s;t their Prince.</P>
<P>It was one of the Objections again&s;t the late Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> at his
Tryal, That he propo&s;ed the Army in <HI>Ireland</HI> to come over hither to the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Maje&s;ty, as People of who&s;e Fidelity he was &s;ure of, and
&s;everal Regiments of them did afterwards come over, and fought for the
King at the Battail at <HI>Nantwich,</HI> among whom were &s;everal Di&s;&s;enters, and
where General <HI>Monk,</HI> then but a Captain, was taken Pri&s;oner, who was
afterwards In&s;trumental in the Re&s;toring the King.</P>
<P>In all the Civil Wars here in <HI>Ireland,</HI> we find none of the&s;e Peo|ple
up in Arms for the Parliament, but we find them zealou&s;ly e&s;|pou&s;ing
the King's Quarrel, and contending with the <HI>Sectaries,</HI> as they
them&s;elves call'd them, who oppo&s;ed the King here.</P>
<P>And as no Te&s;timony of the good Deeds of a Per&s;on, or a Party, can
come with &s;uch unexceptioned Authority as what has the concurring
Te&s;timony of their Enemies, we refer the Reader for the Particulars
to the famous <HI>Milton,</HI> who&s;e Pen mu&s;t needs obtain Credit of our high
Gentlemen &s;ince he Quarrels with the very Men they would quarrel with,
and falls in with the fury of the Times, to expo&s;e tho&s;e they would have
expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Misfortune is, he Expo&s;es the Presbyterians, Rails at and Accu&s;es
them of that as a Crime, the not doing which is the very Crime the&s;e Gen|tlemen
would brand them for now.</P>
<P>Our Modern Authors would &s;et a Mark on the Di&s;&s;enters for fighting a|gain&s;t,
Dethroning and Murthering their King, Subverting the Con&s;tituti|on,
and overthrowing the Government, here we find Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> expo&s;ing
and defaming the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters of <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> for not joining with his
Party in tho&s;e things, but fighting for their King, and endeavouring to pre|vent
the very things for which the&s;e People are accu&s;ed, and endeavour|ing
to re&s;tore the Monarchy in the Son which they would not help to &s;up|pre&s;s
in the Father.</P>
<P>To make out this, the Reader is referred to the particular Authors
and their Writings, which are in every Library of any Value to be
&s;een, the brevity of this Tract not allowing us to quote the&s;e things at
large.</P>
<P>But we cannot omit to quote here the Repre&s;entation of the Presbytery
at <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 15. 1649. wherein the Di&s;&s;enters of the North of
<PB N="10" REF="14">
<HI>Ireland,</HI> declare their dete&s;tation of all the Proceedings in <HI>England;</HI> &s;ee
<HI>Milton</HI>'s Works, Fol. 566, 567.</P>
<P>&startq;What of late have been, and now are, the in&s;olence and pre&s;ump|tuous
Practi&s;es of the Sectaries in <HI>England,</HI> is not unknown to the
World.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Moreover it is more than manife&s;t, that they &s;eek not the Vindication
but the Extirpation of the Laws and Liberties, as appears by their
&s;eizing the Per&s;on of the King, their violent Surprizing, Impri&s;oning and
Secluding many of the mo&s;t worthy Members of the Honourable Hou&s;e
of Commons: neither hath their Fury &s;taid here, but without all Rule
or Example, being but private Men, they have proceeded to the Tryal
of the King, again&s;t both the Intere&s;t, Prote&s;tation and Publick Decla|rations
of both Kingdoms, and with cruel Hands have put him to Death,
an act &s;o horrible as no Hi&s;tory Divine or Humane hath laid a precedent
of the like.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e and many other their de&s;table In&s;olencies, may abundantly
convince any unbya&s;s'd Judgment, that the pre&s;ent practi&s;es of the Sect|aries
and their Abettors, do directly overturn the Laws and Liberties of
the Kingdom, root out lawful and &s;upreme Magi&s;tracy, the ju&s;t Pri|viledges
whereof we have &s;worn to maintain, and Introduce a fearful
Confu&s;ion and lawle&s;s Anarchy.&endq;</P>
<P>And in the &s;ub&s;equent Paragraphs as follows, Fol. 562.</P>
<P>&startq;When we con&s;ider the&s;e things, we cannot but declare and manife&s;t
our utter Di&s;like and Dete&s;tation of all &s;uch unwarrantable Practi&s;es,
directly &s;ubverting our Religion, Laws and Liberties.&endq;</P>
<P>We farther refer the Readers for the Treatment the&s;e Di&s;&s;enters met with
in Print from their Brethren of <HI>England</HI> then in Power, to Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>'s
Ob&s;ervations on the Repre&s;entation in the &s;ame Collection, in Fol. 553,
554, 555, where he treats them with the &s;candalous Terms of <HI>Egregious
Liars and Impo&s;tures, blocki&s;h Presbyters;</HI> and goes on to ju&s;tifie the putting
the King to Death, all the way upbraiding them with Ignorance and Se|paration.</P>
<P>This
Te&s;timony &s;ufficiently clears the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Ireland</HI> from being
concerned in any of the Councils of tho&s;e Days, and the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e
Times which all People are left to peru&s;e, are &s;ufficient to prove how the
Northern Prote&s;tants, being mo&s;t of them Di&s;&s;enters, were the mo&s;t effe|ctual
Barriers of the Royal Intere&s;t at that time, and when all the re&s;t of
the Country was over-run with Popery, Blood and De&s;olation; were left
as a Sanctuary to which the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> and the Royal Party retreat|ed,
that they endured all the Mi&s;eries of a long War, and defended
them&s;elves with the &s;ame Vigor and Ob&s;tinacy as they did in the City of
<HI>Derry</HI> in the late Time, till they were reduced by ab&s;olute Force and the
Current of the Times, being conquer'd and oppre&s;s'd by the prevailing Par|ty
under <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> together with all the re&s;t of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But as the&s;e things are &s;o well known to all the World, as not to require
that we &s;hould repeat them, it remains to examine what Sen&s;e the Royal
Family had of their Behavionr in tho&s;e Times, and what greater Te&s;timo|ny
can be de&s;ired than is naturally deduc'd from the Bounty of King <HI>Charles</HI>

the Second after his Re&s;toration, in the Grant whereof it will appear

State of the Kingdom, the pre&s;&s;ure of the pre&s;ent War, and the
great Exigencies of the State, the Commons thought fit to &s;u&s;pend for a

tho&s;e Forces which were to have fought again&s;t <HI>Ormond,</HI> but have

<P>As this is &s;ufficient to declare their Behaviour in tho&s;e Days, &s;o we have
no le&s;s Authority to prove their hearty Union with the Church of <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
i$ defence of the Prote&s;tant Religion in the late War, and their Ten|derne&s;s

James <HI>his Government;</HI> written by the learned Dr. <HI>King,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Derry,</HI>

<PB N="12" REF="16">
Genero&s;ity, telling us of the Rea&s;ons of the Clergy of <HI>Ireland</HI>
abandoning the Country and their Cures in many places, has the&s;e
Words,</P>
<P>&startq;I do confe&s;s that there was no rea&s;on to complain of the People's
backwardne&s;s to maintain the Clergy, on the contrary they contributed
to the utmo&s;t of their Power, and made no di&s;tinction of Sects; many
Di&s;&s;enters Contributing liberally to this good End, which ought to be
remembred to their Honour&endq;. Archbi&s;hop <HI>King</HI>'s State of <HI>Ireland,</HI> page 231.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied but that this is an Authentick Certificate of their
Charity to the Church, as the other of their Loyalty to their King, and
how it has been <HI>remembred to their Honour,</HI> is left to all impartial Judg|ments,
who plea&s;e to give them&s;elves the trouble to review the Con&s;e|quences
of the Bill lately pa&s;t; by which they have rank'd their Charita|ble
Brethren among&s;t their wor&s;t Enemies, and chain'd them to a Compul|&s;ion
as a means <HI>to prevent the Growth of Popery.</HI></P>
<P>And being brought by this Article to the late War, after the Confe&s;&s;ion
of &s;o eminent a Branch of the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with re&s;pect to their
Charity, it is fit a little to examine their Behaviour in the late Seige of <HI>Derry,</HI>
and the &s;everal Actions at <HI>Inniskilling.</HI></P>
<P>To make out this: Was this Paper confin'd to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and were we writ|ing
to none but our own Country-men, it were ea&s;ie to appeal to the know|ledge
of thou&s;ands yet alive, in who&s;e Memory it mu&s;t yet be very fre&s;h,
with what undi&s;tingui&s;h'd Charity and Alacrity the Di&s;&s;enters join'd with
their Brethren of the Church, in the mutual defence of Religion and Li|berty,
how they went Hand in Hand into the Field, and Hand in Hand
to the Grave, fighting for one another, and their dear Families and Re|ligion.</P>
<P>What tho' they have not the Arrogance to enter upon any di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
Circum&s;tances, in which they might go beyond their Brethren, yet
&s;ince the Church them&s;elves will not a&s;&s;ume a pretence to have out-gone
them, we hope their Mode&s;ty in that Ca&s;e cannot tend to their Prejudice.</P>
<P>We therefore avoid &s;o ungrateful a &s;trife as it mu&s;t be, to find out and
fix the Particulars in which one Party excell'd another; 'tis enough to both
their Honour, that they &s;trove to out-do them&s;elves and one another, as
they plainly did all the re&s;t of the Kingdom in Acts of Gallantry and Cou|rage,
in a free open handed contributing to one anothers Wants, and &s;up|plying
all People concern'd in the defence of the Nation, and in the Per|&s;onal
Bravery in the defence of the place.</P>
<P>Nor are we afraid to enter into a Li&s;t of the Numbers of the People of
either &s;ort &s;lain in that Siege; if they are two Di&s;&s;enters to one Church|man,
they cannot take it ill that we do not boa&s;t of it.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Magi&s;trates of the City of <HI>Derry,</HI> now turned out of Com|mi&s;&s;ion
by this Act, as not &s;afe to be tru&s;ted, are too Mode&s;t to furni&s;h us
with an Account how much Money each of them expended in Provi&s;ions,
Stores, and Charity for the defence of the Town; and the Editor of this
is forc'd to boa&s;t for them, without Reflections on any, that &s;ome of
them have disbur&s;t greater Sums than many of their Succe&s;&s;ors are in Con|dition
to &s;pare, if there &s;hould be the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="17">
The Te&s;timony given by Authority to their Behaviour, in the defence
of their Country, and the Prote&s;tant Religion, is an unque&s;tion'd Proof of
the ju&s;t Claim they have to the Title of Loyal, Faithful and Valiant Sub|jects,
and is a perfect Contradiction to the Notion of obtaining Security a|gain&s;t
them as again&s;t Papi&s;ts, and coupling them with the known Enemies
of the Nation.</P>
<P>The late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> a Name both Nations have an equal Veneration
for, and which we cannot name without a Sigh, had &s;o true a Sen&s;e on her
Mind, of the Courage and Fidelity of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Derry,</HI> that &s;he
gave them a Mark of her Royal Favour in Money, to be employ'd to
rebuild their Market Hou&s;e, and to erect a new Meeting-hou&s;e in that
City.</P>
<P>Nor let us do Inju&s;tice to the Church and Gentry, or Clergy of the
Church of <HI>Ireland;</HI> 'tis mo&s;t certain it never enter'd into the Hearts of the
Conforming Prote&s;tants of this Kingdom, to impo&s;e the&s;e Hard&s;hips upon
their Brethren, much le&s;s did they imagine to have it included in their Bill
to prevent the Growth of Popery.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;o hard, nothing &s;o ungrateful could enter into the Hearts of
the Church in this Kingdom, who could not but remember what the Di&s;|&s;enters
had done to de&s;erve, and from whence they might expect better
U&s;age.</P>
<P>They could not but have it fre&s;h in their Memories, how they had re|lieved
their Clergy in di&s;tre&s;s, harboured their bani&s;h'd, diverted the Forces
of the Enemy, and defended the remnant of the Kingdom again&s;t Popery.</P>
<P>They could not forget the Slaughter made of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army under the
Walls of <HI>Derry,</HI> and how that bold &s;tand, made by &s;uch a handful of Men,
aw'd the Enemy, encourag'd Friends, and made way for the Conque&s;ts of
King <HI>William,</HI> by &s;ecuring to him all the North of <HI>Ireland;</HI> by which means
he had lei&s;ure to March directly to the <HI>Boyn,</HI> and there put the whole For|tune
of <HI>Ireland</HI> upon one deci&s;ive Battel; and by beating the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> there de|livered
this Nation, which he could not have done had the Province of
<HI>&V;l&s;ter</HI> been at his back po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by his Enemies, who would have cut off
his Provi&s;ions, and exceedingly &s;traitned his Quarters.</P>
<P>'Twould be endle&s;s to reckon up all the brave Actions done in this War
by the Di&s;&s;enters, own'd by the King him&s;elf, acknowledg'd by the
Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> rewarded by the Queen, and con&s;ider'd by
the Parliament.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e things I cannot but be of the Opinion, the Di&s;&s;enters in
<HI>Ireland</HI> had a great deal of rea&s;on to expect better Treatment, and had
indeed a ju&s;t Claim to the &s;ame brotherly Charity they &s;hew'd to the
Church.</P>
<P>And here they cannot but lament in them&s;elves the evil of the Times,
when they &s;hould meet with &s;uch u&s;age after all their Services done, and
Duty expre&s;s'd, that contrary to the true Sentiments of the Church of <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
after an Acknowledgment of one of the Primates of the Clergy, that
it ought to be remember'd to their Honour, it &s;hould at la&s;t be remember'd
to their Infamy, and the Di&s;&s;enters be counted with the number of the
Nations Enemies, and included in a Law for the general Security.</P>
<P>And it cannot but be ob&s;erv'd here, the Earl of <HI>N.......</HI> could not
be ignorant of the acknowledgment made by the Archbi&s;hop, in the
Ca&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters Kindne&s;s to the Clergy, which it was his Graces
Opinion, ought to be remember'd with Honour, &s;ince his Imprimatur
<PB N="14" REF="18">
being to that Book, his Lord&s;hip could not but have peru&s;ed the Book,
unle&s;s we &s;hould advance a Notion too mean for a Man of his Capacity
and Prudentials, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Lord&s;hip put his Imprimatur to it, not
having read it over, and &s;o Licens'd he knew not what.</P>
<P>We come now to the Third General Head, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>To examine the Effects this ill Step upon the Di&s;&s;enters may have, with
the particular Circum&s;tances that aggravate it &s;everal ways, and as we go,
to make &s;ome needful Remarks: As,</P>
<P>1. How full of Vici&s;&s;itudes are Humane Things, Times Turn-about,
Men and Parties change Principles, <HI>Nos &amp; mutamur in illis.</HI> The Lord
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Derry,</HI> a Man of Temper and Moderation, being well treated by
the Di&s;&s;enters, recommends it <HI>To be remember'd to their Honour;</HI> but my
Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin</HI> grown quite a new Man, flying in the Face of
all their Merit, and embracing Principles which are de&s;tructive of the
Rights and Liberties of the very People they Rule, prompts with all po&s;|&s;ible
Zeal a Per&s;ecution Spirit, to the Ruin and Injury of tho&s;e very Peo|ple
of whom, by the E... of <HI>N.......</HI>'s leave, he had &s;aid all tho&s;e
things before.</P>
<P>2. Here we cannot but ob&s;erve, how change of things will change Clergy|men,
and other Men too, make moderate Bi&s;hops turn violent Archbi&s;hops,
make Men forget when the Storm's over the Vows they made in the time
of its violence.</P>
<P>Some have had ill Nature enough to compare this with the Practi&s;es of
&s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy, who in the &s;ame times of Trouble in <HI>England,</HI>
promi&s;ed to come to a Temper with the Di&s;&s;enters, in order to draw them
off from clo&s;ing with King <HI>James,</HI> and the extraordinary advantages he of|fer'd
them, and have &s;ince been plea&s;ed to forget very much of that Tem|per,
and pur&s;ue the &s;ame Di&s;&s;enters with ill Language, per&s;ecuting Laws,
and the like.</P>
<P>'Tis unhappy for the Di&s;&s;enters however, that this unchri&s;tian Spirit
&s;hould be convey'd into this Nation, where all liv'd in Peace and U|nion,
and began to cultivate the happy Fruits of Charity and good
Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>'Tis pre&s;um'd the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> had nothing of this in their
Thoughts, and are not plea&s;ed with it now they have it, as they cannot
but &s;ee that it is the beginning of inte&s;tine Strife, and a Bone of Conten|tion,
Emulation and unchri&s;tian Di&s;cord among us, dividing us into Par|ties,
&s;owring and di&s;&s;atisfying thou&s;ands of Prote&s;tants, as good Subjects,
as Loyal to the Queen, as faithful to her Intere&s;t, and without vanity as
able to render her Service as any her Maje&s;ty has in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>And tho' we are a&s;&s;ur'd nothing will be able to extort from the Di&s;&s;en|ters
any thing, either in Word or Action, Undutiful or Di&s;re&s;pectful to
her Maje&s;ty or her Government; yet 'tis no breach of Duty to ob&s;erve,
that it is a great di&s;couragement to the Trade and Pro&s;perity of this King|dom,
as it will occa&s;ion many wealthy Families to abandon their Country
where they are u&s;ed &s;o ill, and will at lea&s;t not invite other Families to
&s;ettle here in their room, where they are &s;ure to be treated with Jealou&s;ie
and Di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>It cannot but be allow'd by any Per&s;ons who have the lea&s;t knowledge
of publick Matters, that to drive the People away from any Country is &s;o
<PB N="15" REF="19">
far to impoveri&s;h that Country; and of all Methods of Goverment it is
the mo&s;t Impolitick, &s;ince the Wealth of a Nation depends upon the Mul|titude
of its Inhabitants. But of all Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> this di&s;tre&s;s'd
Kingdom, that has twice now, in the &s;pace of &s;ixty Years, been in a
manner Depopulated by mo&s;t bloody and inhumane Wars, two Wars that
have been more particularly de&s;tructive to the Inhabitants than may be ex|pected
to happen in like Ca&s;es, and which have de&s;troyed &s;uch incredible
numbers, that 'tis a wonderful thing to &s;ee there &s;hould be People left to
cultivate and manage the Earth; the lea&s;t of the&s;e Wars having, by the
judgment of moderate Computators, kill'd, or driven beyond the Seas,
above 400000 of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not pre&s;ume to foretel, or enter into rea&s;ons, why great num|bers
of the Inhabitants in this Kingdom will remove Them&s;elves and Ef|fects,
upon the melancholly pro&s;pect of Per&s;ecution, and the di&s;courage|ment
received by this Treatment.</P>
<P>But it cannot but be allow'd, that to make them unea&s;ie in their Con|&s;ciences,
or deprive them of the Honours and Tru&s;t which ever &s;ince the
fettling of this Kingdom they have enjoy'd in common with their Bre|thren
of the Church, will be far from inviting other Families to come thi|ther
and &s;ettle, and &s;o keep them as thin of People as the War has left
them.</P>
<P>The advantage this will be to <HI>Scotland,</HI> whither the Di&s;&s;enters in the&s;e
Parts mu&s;t of cour&s;e retreat, and where they talk very big of erecting and
improving the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture: as it is a Subject which affords many
Speculations, &s;o it can be no tre&s;pa&s;s upon Rea&s;on to &s;ay, we believe the
Gentlemen who contriv'd this Law, would not like it the better for its be|ing
a means of Enriching or Encouraging the <HI>Scots..</HI></P>
<P>Asto the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> tho' the Di&s;&s;enters are as we think unkind|ly
treated, we cannot but acquit them, <HI>as a Body,</HI> of being any way
guilty of this thing, and crave leave to lay this Greviance where it real|ly
lies.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, By the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> we mean, the Prote&s;tant Nobility, Gentry
and common People, Inhabitants of this Kingdom conforming to the Church.</P>
<P>And the&s;e being unconcern'd, appear'd, as has been already noted, in
a great &s;urprize; it was perfectly a &s;trange thing to them when they found
their Bill come back clog'd with &s;uch a Clau&s;e as was unwelcome to them
both; and had not the Di&s;&s;enters in the Hou&s;e acquie&s;ced, for the publick
Good, had endanger'd the lo&s;s of their Bill.</P>
<P>If any Man will &s;ugge&s;t, That it was &s;ollicited privately by the Clergy of
the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> they mu&s;t at the &s;ame time &s;ly in the Face of the
Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and charge all the Clergy of <HI>Ireland</HI> with very
much Ingratitude to treat tho&s;e Men &s;o ill, who by the confe&s;&s;ion of the
&s;aid Archbi&s;hop de&s;erv'd to have their Charity and Kindne&s;s to their Bre|thren
<HI>remembred to their Honour.</HI></P>
<P>It can therefore lye no where but among the Enemies of the Di&s;&s;enters,
who for the gratification of their private Malice, or for the carrying on of
&s;ome private De&s;ign, have mi&s;repre&s;ented them at the Court of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and cau&s;ing all their Submi&s;&s;ions and pa&s;t Services to be forgotten,
prevailed to have them treated as Enemies and dangerous Per&s;ons, to that
Government which they had &s;o often and &s;o faithfully defended.</P>
<P>If the E... of <HI>N.....</HI> had been plea&s;ed to remember his Imprimatur
to the Book of his Grace of <HI>Dublin,</HI> as in Honour mo&s;t M$n think he was
<PB N="16" REF="20">
bound he would certainly have made a generous Repre&s;entation of the
Di&s;&s;enters Ca&s;e to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court.</P>
<P>And we hope we cannot be guilty of pre&s;umption in &s;aying, that who|ever
they were-that promoted this Clau&s;e, and what&s;oever their Rea&s;ons
might be, they cannot pretend that in it they pur&s;ued her Maje&s;ty's true
Intere&s;t, or indeed her own genuine or glorious De&s;ign, which appears
from her own Royal Mouth to be the Good, the Peace and Pro&s;perity
of all her Prote&s;tant Subjects, &s;ince to oppre&s;s a Party of them, and per&s;ecute
them for their Religion, at a time when her Maje&s;ty has declar'd her
Royal Intentions to the contrary, can never be agreeable to her Maje&s;ty's
Plea&s;ure, nor could ever have been obtain'd without &s;ome Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion
of her Maje&s;ty's Loyal and Faithful Subjects.</P>
<P>Farther, 'tis our Opinion that the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as before de&s;crib'd,
cannot be the Agents of this ill Treatment, becau&s;e 'tis apparent the Sen&s;e
both of what the Di&s;&s;enters have done and &s;uffer'd, for the &s;ecurity and
pre&s;ervation of that Church, would have given all its moderate Members
&s;uch Satisfaction, and made them &s;o ea&s;y with the Di&s;&s;enters, and the Di&s;|&s;enters
with them, that the Peace and Union which her Maje&s;ty has &s;o
earne&s;tly recommended to her Subjects in <HI>England,</HI> &s;eem'd to be arrived to
a perfection in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>To the Papi&s;ts in particular there appear'd no difference, Prote&s;tants were
always treated alike as Enemies, and always heartily concerned them&s;elves
for one another in their mutual Defence.</P>
<P>'Tis no vanity to &s;ay, the Church-men could 'not have defended them|&s;elves
again&s;t the Papi&s;ts without the Di&s;&s;enters; and we need appeal to
no body but them&s;elves for the truth of it; we need ask none but the
Church-men, whether the Di&s;&s;enters did not both in their Per&s;ons and
Pur&s;es heartily join with them, and if they &s;hould be &s;o di&s;ingenuous as to
deny it, the Papi&s;ts them&s;elves would confe&s;s it for them.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, and relieving them, both Clergy and
Laity, in their flight and di&s;tre&s;s is fairly and honourably own'd by the
Church, and by one of the mo&s;t eminent of their Dignified Clergy, his
Grace the Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> as has been already noted.</P>
<P>Nor can we forbear to mention, to the Honour of the Church of <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
that they have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, and &s;o far from expre&s;&s;ing
any heat, or breach of Charity, &s;o far from inclining to a per&s;ecuting
Temper, or from envying, or mole&s;ting the Di&s;&s;enters in their Con&s;cien|tious
Liberties, that they have enjoy'd a perfect and entire Liberty, tho
without any Toleration by a Law, and this Liberty, to the Honour of the
Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> Prote&s;tants, was found free from all tho&s;e Heart-burn|ings,
In&s;ultings, Lampoons and Reproaches, which their Neighbours have
been treated with on that account; they liv'd together in Charity, good
Neighbourhood, and &s;ettled friendly Corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>And as the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> of their meer Inclination gave to the Di&s;|&s;enters
an undi&s;turb'd Liberty of Con&s;cience, &s;o on the other hand the Di&s;|&s;enters
manife&s;ted their entire confidence in the Chri&s;tian Temper and Mo|deration
of the Church, and never &s;ollicited the obligation of a Law to the
Toleration of their Religious Wor&s;hip; they knew they had oblig'd the
Church to the highth, and always frankly join'd Hearts and Hands to
defend them, and as they found no ungrateful U&s;age they fear'd
none; and thus they lived together in full Confidence of one another, and
as they never expected this act, &s;o we firmly believe it was the re|mote&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="21">
thing in the World from their Thought to put any &s;uch thing upon
the Publick as the joyning the Di&s;&s;enters with the Nation's Enemies, and
ranking them with tho&s;e they ought to be afraid of.</P>
<P>If any Man &s;hould ask now what will be the Effect of all this Hard&s;hip
and ill U&s;age, <HI>which is the Fourth Head,</HI> the Author of this an&s;wers, there
cannot be Place in the Compa&s;s of the&s;e Sheets to enumerate all the unhap|py
Con&s;equences of this Matter; nor may it be fit to &s;ugge&s;t what we ought
to fear on this Account. But as far as may con&s;i&s;t with Rea&s;on, we an&s;wer
1. Negatively.</P>
<P>Nothing Tumultuous, nothing Di&s;obedient or Undutiful to her Maje&s;ty,
who&s;e Inclination we have abundant Rea&s;on to know, is entirely &s;et to
promote the Peace of all her Dominions, and the general Union of all her
People. We &s;hould not pre&s;ume to quote the Addre&s;s from the Prebyterian
Mini&s;ters of the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and how they boa&s;t to her Maje&s;ty in
the&s;e Words, <HI>According to our known Principles of Loyalty,</HI> were it not known
to her Maje&s;ty, and even to the Di&s;&s;enters Enemies that nothing has ever
been able to &s;hake their Fidelity to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown; and that their
Principles have never been Tainted with Di&s;obedience or Di&s;affection,
either to the Per&s;ons or Government of our Prote&s;tant Princes.</P>
<P>Therefore as the wor&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters Enemies cannot &s;ugge&s;t any thing
Undutiful of them, with the lea&s;t Shadow of Rea&s;on; &s;o they will be ef|fectually
di&s;appointed in their Expectations, that any Hard&s;hips put upon
the Di&s;&s;enters, of what &s;ort, or by what Means, Contrivance, or Procure|ment
&s;oever, will drive them, either by Word or Action, to expre&s;s the lea&s;t
Di&s;re&s;pect to her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on or Government, much le&s;s to &s;how any
Undutiful Di&s;turbing, or factious Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Nor can the Appeal made to all the World in the Publication of the&s;e
Sheets, in Behalf of the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;ignifie any &s;uch thing, being no
other than a &s;etting the Ca&s;e in a true Light; that, if po&s;&s;ible, the Eyes
of the Nation's Repre&s;entatives or Governours being open'd, they may
become Advocates for them, and humble Petitioners with them to her
Maje&s;ty, to repeal that Part of this Act that treats them in &s;uch a manner,
that they may no longer, <HI>without any De&s;ert of their own,</HI> lie under &s;o hea|vy
a Burthen, as being mi&s;repre&s;ented to their Prince, and being counted
Dangerous to that State they &s;o zealou&s;ly and ardently fought for, and en|gag'd
their Lives and Fortunes to &s;ave.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Not Peace and &V;nion.</HI> For as &s;uch a Law cannot but Sower and
Di&s;compo&s;e the Parties, and make One &s;ide always regret the Wrong they
think done them; &s;o on the other Hand, it rouzes the Evil Spirit of Ma|lice
and Envy in tho&s;e, who had before no Inclination to in&s;ult their Bre|thren.

that this would e&s;tabli&s;h Peace and Union, it mu&s;t be referr'd to the
Example of the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where this Law is likely to fill a peaceable
Nation with all the Con&s;tant, but Fatal Attendants of contending Parties,
to the Breach of that Union, Peace, Charity, and Temper which
reign'd in the Hearts of all her Maje&s;ty's Subjects, of what Per&s;wa&s;ion
foever.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="22">
Certainly Oppre&s;&s;ion of Con&s;ciences, or Deprivation of Benefits for
the Sake of Con&s;cience, can never be a means of uniting Parties. '<HI>Tis im|po&s;&s;ible</HI>
any Party can be ea&s;y to &s;ee known Loyalty of Principles &s;u&s;pect|ed,
unbroken Duty and untainted Affection treated with Doubts, and
enacted again&s;t as dangerous.</P>
<P>Either the Di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tants of <HI>Ireland</HI> are dangerous to the Go|vernment,
there is &s;omething to befear'd from-them, or the Act would be
prepo&s;terous, and there can be no Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd for the making it; and
joyning them with the Enemies of the Nation would be barbarous and un|chri&s;tian.
But the wor&s;t Enemy they have cannot charge them with One
Action, either in Memory or in Hi&s;tory, in Modern or in Antient Time,
that can make them &s;o much as look like Men dangerous to the Govern|ment,
or from whom something is to be fear'd. <HI>Ergo</HI></P>
<P>If then this Act has divided tho&s;e Prote&s;tants into Parties who were
united before, has fill'd them with Heats, Animo&s;ities and Repinings at
one another that were in perfect Peace before, will any Man &s;ay we are in
the wrong in &s;aying among the Effects of this Bill negatively Not <HI>Peace</HI>
and <HI>&V;nlon.</HI></P>
<P>Di&s;contenting any one &s;ort of People to plea&s;e another, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing one
Part to rai&s;e another, &s;etting one Party above another; the&s;e can ne|ver
be made u&s;e of as Arguments to prove that Peace will be the Effect;
and above all it is plain it will never bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Peace and Union are the Native Produce of ea&s;y Laws, Plenty, and
Pro&s;perity; People are apt to be plea&s;ed when they are ea&s;y, when they
enjoy their Rights, and when an Equality of the Government fways all
Parties; but if there is a Bya&s;s in the ruling Powers again&s;t or for one
Party more than another, 'tis natural for the oppre&s;s'd Party to envy or re|pine
at the other. It breeds ill Blood, it boils in the Brea&s;t of the Party, and
'tis impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; and therefore 'tis not to be expect|ed
that any of the Con&s;equences of this Act can be Peace and Union.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Not the Increa&s;e of Trade.</HI> This is apparent, for that the People of
all Governments trade free&s;t when they are ea&s;y. Trade always declines
in Governments where the People are not ea&s;y; and any one might &s;ee
it in <HI>London,</HI> during a certain time when a particular Bill was on-foot in
the Hou&s;e; Stocks, Publick Credit and Actions of Companies always ro&s;e
and fell as that Bill did or did not go forward in the Hou&s;e: What Joy in
Trade, what Ri&s;e of Stocks, what a Flux of Credit was in that Nation at
the Demi&s;e of that Bill!</P>
<P>We have indeed no Banks, <HI>East India</HI> Companies, or Publick Stocks
in <HI>Ireland</HI> to feel the &s;en&s;ible Injury done to Trade; but if any Man will
ask whether the Di&s;&s;enters, who are &s;ome of the principle Traders in that
Kingdom, will launch out the farther, and embark the more heartily in
Trade for being Di&s;honour'd, Disfranchis'd, Di&s;heartned and Suppre&s;t; it
is a Que&s;tion that needs very little An&s;wer, and what the meanc&s;t Un|decr&s;tanding
in the World would give a Negative to with little or no He|&s;itation.</P>
<P>Can
it be, that the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould wi&s;h well to that Country, where
notwith&s;tanding their con&s;tant &s;teady Loyalty, their univer&s;al En|gaging
in its Defence, the Expence of their Blood and E&s;tates in oppo&s;ing
Popery, they &s;hould be now &s;u&s;pected as dangerous to its Welfare, turn'd
out of all Honours, Tru&s;ts or Profits in the Neighbourhood, and look'd
upon as Per&s;ons un&s;afe to be tru&s;ted in any Publick Employment. Such
<PB N="19" REF="23">
Treatment can never be attractive of the Affections and the Love of the
Di&s;&s;enters; they cannot &s;tudy the Pro&s;perity of a Country where they are
us'd with &s;o much ungrateful Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>If then their Affections to the Place may ju&s;tly be chang'd by unkind
Treatment, the Tran&s;po&s;ing them&s;elves, their Stocks and Families into o|ther
Parts is a Con&s;equence we may &s;ay more to afterwards; but the Trade
following the Traders by Con&s;equence the Country will &s;ink in its People,
Wealth, and Trade.</P>
<P>There are more Negatives which might be in&s;i&s;ted on here, when we
are enquiring into the Con&s;equences of this Act; as</P>
<P>4. <HI>No Reputation to the Church of Ireland,</HI> to Per&s;ecute tho&s;e People of
whom the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin</HI> has recorded in Print, that their Kindne&s;s
and Charity to her Clergy in their Flight and Di&s;tre&s;s de&s;erves to be re|member'd
to their Honour. Ingratitude can be no Reputation either to
a Party or Church, any more than to a &s;ingle Per&s;on; and though the
Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters of <HI>Ireland</HI> do acquit the Church <HI>as &s;uch</HI> of contriving
this Hard&s;hip, yet the Scandal will for ever lie on the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
&s;o far as they dip their Hands in the unhappy <HI>if rigorous</HI> Execution
of it.</P>
<P>Nor will this ever tend to the Reputation of the Govern&mdash;- of <HI>Ire|land.</HI>&mdash;To
&s;ay they were impos'd upon any where is to &s;ay nothing; for
though 'tis not a Man's Fault that he is impos'd upon, 'tis a Di&s;reputation
to him to be impos'd on: And the farther tho&s;e Arguments are true which
acquit the Gentry and the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> of de&s;igning this Mi&s;chief to
the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, the farther this Di&s;reputation of their Conduct
will appear.</P>
<P>If they had no Hand in the Contrivance of this Clau&s;e, if it was &s;ent
back with that Clau&s;e incerted without the Privity or Knowledge of any
of the Governing Party in this Kingdom, either in Church or State, this
may acquit them of Ingratitude to the Di&s;&s;enters, but it can never acquit
them of being impos'd upon &s;omewhere: And if they had furni&s;h'd
them&s;elves with Courage and Honour enough to have repre&s;ented back
the Services, the Fidelity and Loyalty of the Di&s;&s;enters, and their Debt
of Kindne&s;s and Charity to them; if all this had been laid before her
Maje&s;ty, we cannot doubt but &s;uch Orders would have been given by her
Maje&s;ty's Gracious Direction as are &s;uitable to that Tenderne&s;s &s;he has al|ways
expre&s;s'd to her People in General, and as we know to be the Innate
and Heredirary Quality of our Sovereign.</P>
<P>Nay had our Clergy repre&s;ented to the Right Honourable the E... of
<HI>N.</HI> then Secretary of State, and through who&s;e Hands this Law, with this
unhappy additional Clau&s;e mu&s;t pa&s;s, had they repre&s;ented to his Lord&s;nip
the Kindne&s;s, Charity and Goodne&s;s which the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hew'd to their
per&s;ecuted Brethren, rccorded, as is noted, by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Duhlin;</HI> had
they reminded him that his Lord&s;hip's <HI>Imprimatur</HI> is to the Book, and that
him&s;elf pa&s;s'd it into the World; that his Lord&s;hip has thereby own'd to
all the World that <HI>it ought to be remember'd of the Di&s;&s;enters to their Ho|nour,</HI>
that they reliev'd the Clergy of the Church in their Suffering with|out
Di&s;tinction&mdash;-had his Lord&s;hip been referr'd back to this Te&s;timon$
under his own Hand, he is a Gentleman of too much Ju&s;tice and Honour
ever to have forwarded &s;uch a Bill, without humbly laying it before her
Maje&s;ty, that to his Knowledge they de&s;erv'd better Treatment.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="24">
It can therefore never be reckon'd up to the Honour and Reputation of
the G.....t or Clergy in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that they &s;hould repre&s;ent the Ca&s;e
to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> u&s;e their Intere&s;t to obtain &s;uch a Remi&s;&s;ion
as, in Gratitude for Service done, and Love expre&s;s'd, they ow'd to
the Di&s;&s;enters. And all we can &s;ay for them on that Head, is
the great Concern they were in for the Lo&s;s of the Needful Security a|gain&s;t
Popery, together with Re&s;olutions to make the Di&s;&s;enters &s;ome fu|ture
Amends, which may &s;omething extenuate the thing.</P>
<P>5. Another Negative may be thus expre&s;s'd. This will certainly be no
Encouragement to the Di&s;&s;enters to joyn with their Brethren in their mu|tual
Defence the next time the Papi&s;ts &s;hall plea&s;e to take Arms, and at|tempt
their Throats.</P>
<P>Not but that perhaps they may be Fools enough, as they always were, to &s;tand
in the Gap, and 'tis plain they have actually &s;av'd the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> from
Ruin; but it cannot be that they have any Arguments to move them to
it from this Bill. If they had no other Inducements, they could never be
thought to be mov'd to it from this Law.</P>
<P>If ever the Papi&s;ts in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hould rebel and commence a new Ma&s;&s;a|cre,
as 'tis known they have good Will enough to do, and the Prote&s;tants
of the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> taking Arms to defend them&s;elves, &s;hould &s;ay
to the Di&s;&s;enters, Come <HI>help the Lord again&s;t the Mighty;</HI> and the Di&s;&s;en|ters
&s;hould &s;ay, &startq;No, Gentlemen, we are not fit to be tru&s;ted, we were
not fit to be Mayors or Ju&s;tices; Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e or Exci&s;e Officers, Aldermen
or Common-Councilmen for Fear of the Growth of Popery, pray take
Care of it your &s;elves; we were not to be tru&s;ted with Commi&s;&s;ions in
your Army, or your Country <HI>Militia,</HI> pray fight by your &s;elves; we
were not to be intru&s;ted in your Stores, pray be your own Gunners;
we'll have no Hand in it; you are able no doubt to beat the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> with|ont
us, pray don't trouble us about it, 'tis none of our Bu&s;ine&s;s, you
took it out of our Hands by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>We are content to appeal to all the World whether &s;uch an An&s;wer as
this would not be <HI>Lex Talionis,</HI> would not be fair and ju&s;t in the Di&s;&s;en|ters;
and whether indeed, all things con&s;ider'd, they ought not to act thus,
and an&s;wer thus, if ever the Ca&s;e came to the Cri&s;is, and they &s;hould be
tried as they have been already&mdash;- Would not all the World call them
Fools, to do any thing again that merits <HI>to be remember'd to their Honour</HI>&mdash;If
this be the Church's Method of <HI>remembring Favours,</HI> if this be their
<HI>Returns of Gratitude,</HI> let them fight for them next time that dare tru&s;t
their Temper.</P>
<P>And here, with Submi&s;&s;ion, there appears &s;ome Incon&s;i&s;tency in the ve|ry
Act it &s;elf; and the Con&s;equences of this Bill &s;till as to Negatives will
be really,</P>
<P>6. No preventing the Growth of Popery. Will any Man in the World
tell us, that <HI>To divide Prote&s;tants is a way to prevent the further Growth of
Popery.</HI> This is like &s;inking the Ship to drown the Rats&mdash;like Cutting
off the Foot to cure the Corns. To divide Prote&s;tants is to weaken them,
or el&s;e our Saviour was a fal&s;e Prophet; and can weakening the Prote&s;tant
Intere&s;t be a way to prevent the Growth of Popery?</P>
<P>This would merit &s;ome Satyr if the Ca&s;e was not really too &s;ad and &s;e|rious
to bear a Banter. If the&s;e are Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> Politicks, for Shame
Gentlemen never reproach the Native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> for winking when they &s;hoot,
for never Marks-men took &s;uch Aim as this. 'Tis &s;uch a <HI>Tale of a Tub</HI> the
<PB N="21" REF="25">
very <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> them&s;elves mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity laugh at it; and where
as we have been told they were in Hopes this Clau&s;e would break the Bill,
divide the Hou&s;e, and &s;o the Bill be lo&s;t, we are of Opinion they ought
to have acquie&s;c'd and forwarded the pa&s;&s;iug the Bill for the Sake of this
Clau&s;e; for what could be of more Service to the Popi&s;h Intere&s;t in that
Kingdom than to &s;ee the Prote&s;tants thus divided, per&s;ecuting, di&s;tru&s;ting
and di&s;obliging one another&mdash;To &s;ee that Party &s;uppre&s;s'd, trampl'd
on and di&s;&s;atisfied who were always the dead Weight again&s;t Popery, from
whom they received the mo&s;t Power and Shot, and by whom they were
always wor&s;t handled&mdash;This certainly ought to have comforted them,
made them hope for a Re&s;toration of their Affairs with more Proba|billity
than ever, and might be thought a &s;ufficient Satisfaction to them
for all the other Di&s;appointments of that Bill.</P>
<P>How can it but be an inexpre&s;&s;ible Satisfaction and Plea&s;ure to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Papi&s;ts, who wi&s;h all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants out of the Kingdom, to &s;ee a
great many of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t trading Inhabitants draw in their Ef|fects,
remit their Money to other Places, follow it with their Fa|milies;
and a Law made by their Fellow Prote&s;tants, which making them
unea&s;y is the Occa&s;ion of it all.</P>
<P>If it be an&s;wer'd, the Church Party are &s;trong enough to take Care of
the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> without the Di&s;&s;enters, this opens the Door to a very unhappy
Argument again&s;t them, <HI>Then what need of the Act;</HI> if there was no Occa|&s;ion
for it, <HI>Why was it made?</HI> And this would cau&s;e the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI>
to run the Ri&s;que of being charg'd with &s;ome &s;pecial Malice, to make a
Law &s;o grievous to their Brethren, &s;o unkind, and &s;o otherwi&s;e ill circum|&s;tanc'd,
without any manner of Occa&s;ion for it; wherefore we choo&s;e to
di&s;mi&s;s that An&s;wer as a vain Pretence, and bring it to matter of Truth.</P>
<P>That there is Occa&s;ion in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> to prevent the Growth
of Popery.</P>
<P>That the united Force of all the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Ireland</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to
di&s;courage and keep it down, and all little enough.</P>
<P>And if &s;o, then 'tis a great Encouragement to the Growth of Popery
to divide and di&s;unite the Prote&s;tants; and con&s;equently, the Act di&s;agrees
with it &s;elf, it pulls down in one part what it builds up in another; the
Whole is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Parts, and incoherent with the Title.</P>
<P>'Tis time to have done with the Negatives. The Affirmative Con&s;e|quences
of this matter are many, and time may make them appear to be
more than yet they &s;eem to be; &s;ome of them have been toucht in their
Contraries.</P>
<P>1. Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience Sake, which whatever may have been pre|tended,
has been in all Ages allow'd to be contrary to the Principles of
the Chri&s;tian Religion, and is Publickly di&s;own'd and di&s;approv'd by the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> which is allow'd to be the Parent and Nur&s;ing Mother
of the Church of <HI>Ireland.</HI> To per&s;ecute for the Sake of a Con&s;cientious
Difference, as it has no Scriptural Authority &s;o it has no Humane Autho|rity
to give it any Colour of a Law, or to make it agreeable to the Minds
of Men&mdash;- And therefore when we call it Per&s;ecution, we find none of
the Church pretend to ju&s;tify the Article of Per&s;ecution as lawful; but they
would come off here by proving, that this is not Per&s;ecution; becau&s;e, &s;ay
they, we allow you the Liberty of all Religious Wor&s;hip your own Way.</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to this is &s;o unhappily plain, that &s;ad and mo&s;t pitiful
Shifts are made to evade it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="26">
Per&s;ecution, if we under&s;tand it right, is puni&s;hing any Per&s;on or Peo|ple
for not complying with, or conforming to, &s;ome Particular of Divine
Wor&s;hip, or &s;ome Article of Religion which that Power that per&s;ecutes
demands a Conformity to.</P>
<P>Now if tho&s;e Gentlemen, who will not have the&s;e things go under the
Title of Per&s;ecution, will tell us that to turn all the Di&s;&s;enters out of
Places of Honour, Tru&s;t and Profit for not complying with the Sacrament,
is not puni&s;hing them for not complying with &s;ome Particular of Divine
Wor&s;hip, they will come to a Nece&s;&s;ity of proving One of the&s;e Two
things.</P>
<P>1. That inflicting Penalties is no Puni&s;hment. Or,
2. That the Sacrament is no Particular of Divine Wor&s;hip, or no Re|ligious
Act.</P>
<P>Any Man would be glad to &s;ee either of the&s;e Two points &s;o an&s;wer'd,
as that this Cau&s;e might be clear'd from the Scandal, and the Church of
<HI>Ireland</HI> be acquitted from practicing that Per&s;ecution which her Principle
di&s;owns.</P>
<P>2. The &s;econd Con&s;equence, which any wi&s;e Man may fore&s;ee mu&s;t
follow this Matter is <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI>&mdash;The Effects of that capacious Word are
too many and too long, to be de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>Divi&s;ions have too long afflicted the&s;e unhappy Nations to leave us in
any Degree Strangers to their ill Con&s;equences. The Queen's Maje&s;ty, in
all her late mo&s;t Excellent Speeches to her Parliament, has given us true
Ideas of the fatal Effect of Divi&s;ions, and Breaches in the Union of a Na|tion;
and &s;ufficiently warn'd all her Subjects, were they a People capable
of Warning, again&s;t all the Circum&s;tances that lead to &s;uch an Evil.</P>
<P>The Union of Prote&s;tants in <HI>Ireland,</HI> till now, was very remarkable;
&s;ome hints have been given of it in this Tract, and much more might
be &s;aid on that plea&s;ant Subject; but the Di&s;contents that begin already
to &s;how their ill A&s;pects, and cloud and eclip&s;e the Beauty and Lu&s;tre of
that Light, how many, how numberle&s;s are they! and what a black Pro|&s;pect
have we &s;till of tho&s;e behind!</P>
<P>To divide the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t is to weaken it, to weaken that is to
&s;trengthen its contrary, Popery; and what can be a more fatal Blow to
the general Good of that Nation.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> a Learned and a Sen&s;ible Gentleman, who wrote of,
and very well under&s;tood the Intere&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> has this very apt Notion
of the Intere&s;t of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and with that we &s;hall end this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;But that which would, above all other Expedients, tend to the
&s;trengthning the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>Ireland,</HI> would be to endeavour a
right Under&s;tanding and charitable Union between all &s;ober pious Pro|te&s;tants
in matters of Religion, the Want of which increa&s;eth ground|lefs
Jealou&s;ies of each other, and &s;trengthneth the Confidence of the
common Enemy of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, that they are ea&s;ily run down,
as in the Ma&s;&s;acre 1641. when at fir&s;t they declar'd their De&s;ign was a|gain&s;t
the Puritannical Party, then again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> not the <HI>Scots:</HI> But I

purchas'd under the Valour and Conduct of that Prince, by the joint
Concurrence of the Prote&s;tant Power, undi&s;tingui&s;h'd as to Party, Profe&s;|&s;ion,
or Opinion.</P>
<P>'Tis with in&s;inite Regret they &s;ee the Endeavours of their Ene|mies

which were introduced for the Security of this Nation, pointed at them
in Company with the Capital Enemies of <HI>Ireland.</HI> They cannot believe
the Church of <HI>Ireland as &s;uch</HI> could entertain a Thought &s;o de&s;tructive to
the general Welfare, as the loading the Di&s;&s;enters with Crimes, which, by
God's Grace, they never were, or will be guilty of; or be &s;o unkind as to e|nact
again&s;t them as Criminal, while under the authentick Te&s;timonies of
Loyalty and Good Services done to your whole Body, as well as the Go|vernment,

for the Safety of both.</P>
<P>They are therefore rather enclined to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hall meet with Ea&s;e

and for them, to their Sovereign, that &s;uch part of this Pre&s;&s;ure as, your

In&s;olence, Rebellion, or In&s;urrection of the Native <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> whether
back'd by Foreign Alliance, or not, they are able of them&s;elves, without
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e dangerous Prote&s;tants, call'd Di&s;&s;enters, to oppo&s;e,
&s;ight, conquer, and reduce the &s;aid Native <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>2. Whether if it be true that the Native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and Papi&s;ts, by com|mon
Calculation are Eight to One again&s;t the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> and Prote&s;tants in
that Kingdom, &s;peaking inclu&s;ively of all &s;orts of Di&s;&s;enters: The &s;aid
<HI>Iri&s;h, &amp;c.</HI> would not be above Sixteen to One, in Ca&s;e all &s;orrs of Di&s;&s;en|ters
are excluded from every Part of the Defence, and laid by either as
Neuters, or as Enemies.</P>
<P>3. Whether, allow the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> to be wor&s;e Cowards and Scoundrels than
ever they yet appeared, whether they think it po&s;&s;ible to fight them with
the Inequality of One to Sixteen.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> Whether it be rea&s;onable to expect the Di&s;&s;enters, who, in
time of Peace, and without Provocation, are enacted again&s;t as dangerous
Enemies, and not thought fit to be tru&s;ted with Po&s;ts of Profit, &s;hould be
concern'd in Ca&s;e of Rebellion and War to accept of Places of Hazards,
and embark in the Defence of tho&s;e People who treated them &s;o un|kindly.</P>
<P>3.
Pa&s;t Actions. Whether ever the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> when oppre&s;s'd
or in&s;ulted by the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> were able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t them, with|out
the Help of their Di&s;&s;enting Brethren?</P>
<P>4. Whether they found them backward in &s;uch time of Di&s;tre&s;s to ven|ture
their Fortunes and Blood for the general Pre&s;ervation? And whether
by right of War they have not an equal Claim to the Privileges of that
Peace they help'd to obtain.</P>
<P>If we might be allow'd here to expo&s;tulate with the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
it &s;hould be to ask them, Gentlemen, do you think the Papi&s;ts are likely
ever to renounce their old Principles of Hatred again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as a
Nation; or that upon every Opportunity they &s;hould not be very forward
to put in Practice the former Rage again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in ge|neral;
whether, when they find an Occa&s;ion to put this in Practice, either
by In&s;urrection, General Ma&s;&s;acre, or any other publick or private Me|thod,
they will di&s;tingui&s;h Church Prote&s;tants from Di&s;&s;enting Prote|&s;tants.</P>
<P>We
de&s;ire, with all Mode&s;ty and po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect, to ask whether you
do not &s;eem to expre&s;s a greater Confidence in the Di&s;&s;enters on one Hand,
than is con&s;i&s;tent with the Di&s;tru&s;t and Diffidence on the other Hand,
which mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to make it rational, that they &s;hould be enacted a|gain&s;t
in the &s;ame Law with Papi&s;ts and Enemies to the Government; and
whether you do not &s;eem hereby to own, that we are more Loyal to the
Government, and True to the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t than your &s;elves, in that
you venture to put the highe&s;t Indignity, Reproach and Affront upon us,
and thereby pre&s;ume we are by no ill Treatment to be provoked &s;o much
as to &s;tand Neuter when your Defence requires our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, much le&s;s
that you &s;hould think, we&s;hall on any Terms be brought to joyn with the
Papi&s;ts in your De&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="29">
We would be glad you would reconcile the&s;e two palpable Contradicti|ons;
and would willingly know, whether, if after all this Treatment,
the next time the Papi&s;ts of this Kingdom &s;hall think fit to in&s;ult you, and
the Di&s;&s;enters fall in, and with the Hazards of their Lives, E&s;tates, and
all that is dear to them, defend you, whether you will not blu&s;h at this
Bill, and enter your Acknowledgment upon Record, as it is already, that
the&s;e Things ought to be remembred to their Honour?</P>
<P>It cannot be defended by the Rules of Charity, Chri&s;tian-Love, and
Good Neighbourhood, any more than it can from the Rules of Ju&s;tice
or Policy, that the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be thus treated; &s;ince they,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e of them who now inhabit the Northern Parts of the King|dom,
came to you as Fellow-Planters and Settlers of Collonies, in the
Beginning of the Peopling this Nation by the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants; and
con&s;equently, have equal Right of Liberty and Settlement as your &s;elves;
or el&s;e came hither as Auxiliaries, as indeed they have ever &s;ince prov'd,
and as your A&s;&s;i&s;tants again&s;t your Enemies; and have thereby obtain'd a
Right of Settlement and Liberty by Treaties and Capitulations, which
ought not to be violated or invaded.</P>
<P>Upon all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, and many more, of which they &s;ave to
them&s;elves the Liberty of reminding you, as Occa&s;ion requires, they de&s;ire
to lay before you calmly and &s;edately; and in all Tenderne&s;s and Charity
the Hard&s;hip, and, as they think, Inju&s;tice of tho&s; Gentlemen, who think
they merit &s;uch &s;evere Treatment.</P>
<P>They humbly appeal to your certain Knowledge in their con&s;tant Beha|viour,
and in the Truth of every Article in&s;i&s;ted on in this Book: And the
Author of this Tract is not afraid to take upon him the Demon&s;tration of
all the Particulars; and to recommend them, in Bealf of the Di&s;&s;enters, to
the Gentlemen of the Church, as their Fellows, in all po&s;&s;ible degrees of
Right to the Peace of this Nation; and mo&s;t earne&s;tly to de&s;ire their
&s;erious Con&s;iderations of the Indignities, Injuries and Oppre&s;&s;ions they al|ready
&s;uffer, and are likely yet farther to &s;uffer on this Account.</P>
<P>And thus they are your humble Petitioners, that from a Sence of Ju&s;tice,
Gratitude, and Chri&s;tian Charity, as you know the Di&s;&s;enters innocent of
any thing to merit being treated &s;everely, from a Sence of Intere&s;t, Pru|dence,
and Civil Polity, as there is more than ordinary Occa&s;ion of a &s;irm
Union among all Prote&s;tants for the mutual Defence of them&s;elves and the
Nation; and as you would encourage the Di&s;&s;enters, and expect of them
to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in Ca&s;e of any future Dangers from the Publick Enemy, and
from a Sence of the Chri&s;tian Obligation of Charity and Forbearance,
which in all Ca&s;es declares again&s;t Coertion or Puni&s;hments in Ca&s;es of
Con&s;cieuce, and from many other Rea&s;ons, as well Civil as Religious, too
long to be here enumerated, <HI>You would be plea&s;ed</HI> to become humble Inter|ce&s;&s;ors
with her Maje&s;ty, and the Parliament of this Kingdom, for the Re|peal
of that part of the Clau&s;e, and Remi&s;&s;ion of that part of this Act,
which they have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to complain is grievous to them, as Prote&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enters; and again&s;t the Honourable Remembrance of their former Loy|alty
and Services; and that they may no longer be reckoned among the
Nations Enemies, and enacted again&s;t as People dangerous and &s;u&s;pected,
at lea&s;t till by &s;ome di&s;loyal or di&s;affected Behaviour, which they tru&s;t will
never be found on them, they &s;hall have done fomething to for&s;eit the
Title of, as well as the Protection, which all Governments think due to,
faithful and peaceable Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30">
Thus you will effectually &s;ecure this Kingdom again&s;t the Growth of
Popery, by firmly uniting the Hearts and Hands of all her Maje&s;ty's Pro|te&s;tant
Subjects, in the vigorous Defence both of her Per&s;on and Govern|ment;
and in that ble&s;&s;ed Peace and Union, which her Maje&s;ty has, on all
Occa&s;ions, declared to be her pious De&s;ire, and has &s;o often recommended
to all her Subjects.</P>
