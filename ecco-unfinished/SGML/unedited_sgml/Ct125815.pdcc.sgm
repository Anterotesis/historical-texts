to hear off, is yet re&s;erved in the Book of Fate; which Calamities, I flatter my&s;elf, by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, are greatly in our Power, as ANTIGALLICANS, to avert; were we hearty, zealous, and indefatigable in our Country's Cau&s;e; like the fam'd <HI>Spartans</HI> of old at the Straits of <HI>Thermpylae,</HI> we might make a noble Stand, and &s;ave her in the mo&s;t perilous Time: This, my Lord, may be looked on as an Hyperbole; but as our Plan might be greatly improved, I conceive it not impracticable: A red Coat, my Lord, does not make a Man brave; in order to it, may Courage, Virtue, and Publick Spirit, be the di&s;tingui&s;hing Charac|teri&s;tics of every ANTIGALLICAN; may our Songs be martial; may our Admi&s;&s;ion of Members be &s;eriou&s;ly at|tended to, and their Initiation &s;trongly enforced; and that the Order of ANTIGALLICANS, may long flouri&s;h un|der the Au&s;pices of Lord BLAKENEY, is the ardent De|&s;ire of a Brother, and, my Lord,</P>
