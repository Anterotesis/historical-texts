<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>BE it known unto you, gentle or ungentle reader,
that the author of the following poem is a vo|lunteer
in the &s;ervice, or rather a poetical knight
errant, who, according to the oath taken at the late
in&s;tallation, is <HI>exhorted and admoni&s;hed</HI> (by <HI>Apollo</HI> to
be &s;ure) <HI>to u&s;e his &s;word in defence of all equity and
ju&s;tice to the utmo&s;t of his power.</HI> His brother <HI>Quixote,</HI>
of immortal memory, try'd his prowe&s;s upon Sheep
and Windmills&mdash;Our champion does very near the
&s;ame; and calls forth to the field an <HI>unknown</HI> knight,
who has the &s;ormidable X, Y, Z, in his train.&mdash;And
that he may not be thought to engage with too great
odds on his &s;ide, he oppo&s;es to them his own <HI>three
tru&s;ty &s;quires,</HI> A, B, C, who are re&s;olved to &s;tand by
<PB N="iv" REF="4" MS="Y">
him, and fight all the weapons through, from Epic
Poetry to Epigram, as long as there is a letter left
&s;tanding in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> alphabet&mdash;and now, Mr.
<HI>Churchill</HI> may know, that there is
<Q><L>&mdash;A <HI>Quixote</HI> of the age will dare,</L>
<L>To wage a war with dirt, and fight with air.</L></Q>
When the afore&s;aid <HI>unknown</HI> knight &s;hall plea&s;e to ap|pear
with his <HI>beaver up,</HI> he may expect that our ad|venturer
will &s;hew <HI>his face</HI> too.&mdash;In the mean time,
we will divert him in our turn with a little <HI>bu&s;h</HI>-fight|ing,
which he has been endeavouring to entertain the
town with, for more than a twelvemonth pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It is therefore proper to inform thee, reader, for as
yet perhaps thou ha&s;t not heard of it, that there is a
certain weekly paper, called the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> &s;till exi&s;t|ing,
if it may be call'd exi&s;tence to crawl about from
week to week, and be kept alive by tho&s;e la&s;t re&s;ources
of hungry ingenuity, fal&s;ehood and defamation. In
this &s;aid paper a <HI>certain gentleman</HI> who &s;ub&s;cribes him&s;elf
<PB N="v" REF="5">
X, Y, Z, a volunteer too in the &s;ervice, has thrown
about his dirt in a mo&s;t extraordinary manner, and
has attacked our &s;tage hero, with unwearied malevo|lence
both in his public and private character; but
indeed his rancour being too much for his wit, he has
let his heart indulge it&s;elf at the expence of his head,
and has mo&s;t imprudently made a&s;&s;ertions in the bit|terne&s;s
of his &s;pirit, which can be contradicted by
ev'ry attender upon the theatre.&mdash;It would be endle&s;s
and out of place here to point out his want of ta&s;te,
and even common truth, in his account of the man|ner
of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s &s;peaking and acting in his vari|ous
characters; of his mo&s;t ungentlemanlike, as well
as unju&s;t abu&s;e of his per&s;on, voice, age, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c;
for there is no kind of meanne&s;s, as <HI>Montaigne</HI> well
ob&s;erves, that a true malignant &s;pirit will not de&s;cend
to.&mdash;To give one in&s;tance among a thou&s;and of his
upright intentions&mdash;This worthy gentleman, Mr.
X, Y, Z, not content with expo&s;ing his impotent
malice weekly to the publick, was at the pains and
expence to collect his papers into one volume, and
ev'n &s;end 'em to &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s Friends, lea&s;t
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
the ob&s;curity and di&s;reputation of the paper, in which
they fir&s;t made their appearance, &s;hould have kept his
malice totally a &s;ecret&mdash;The <HI>Reviewers</HI> gave their
&s;entiments of this curious collection, in the following
manner&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e are the overflowings of &s;pleen, ignorance,
conceit, and di&s;appointment.&endq; <HI>Crit. Rev. Jan.</HI> 1761.</P>
<P>&startq;The de&s;ign of publi&s;hing the&s;e <HI>important</HI> pieces
of critici&s;m, is, to prevent the <HI>&s;ad misfortune</HI> of their
&s;inking into oblivion with a la&s;t year's news-paper.
If we believe the author, all the prai&s;es that have
hitherto been given to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> as an actor, are
&s;o entirely without foundation, that &startq;he never did,
nor never could, &s;peak ten &s;ucce&s;&s;ive lines of
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with grammatical propriety.&endq; This is
an a&s;&s;ertion &s;o contrary to the opinion of many better
critics than this author &s;hews him&s;elf to be, and in
reality &s;o oppo&s;ite to truth, that it is alone &s;ufficient
to invalidate all his rea&s;onings upon the &s;ubject.&endq;
<HI>Monthly Rev. Dec.</HI> 1760.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
It would take up too much time at pre&s;ent to
exhibit our hero X, Y, Z, in all his proper colours,
we &s;hall leave that ta&s;k to a much abler hand, who
will very &s;oon more fully detect and expo&s;e him and
his de&s;igns.&mdash;But to return to our poem&mdash;</P>
<P>If may properly be called an <HI>Iliad</HI> in a <HI>nut&s;hell;</HI>
For though it does not con&s;i&s;t of many more than 400
lines, it contains all the e&s;&s;ential epic properties,&mdash;
the plan, &s;entiments, character, diction, moral, metre,
and even the heroes them&s;elves, all in miniature.&mdash;</P>
<P>The following epigram printed in the Ledger, was
the corner-&s;tone of the whole, and furni&s;hed us with
ideas of the redoubted <HI>Fizgig,</HI> the <HI>Achilles</HI> of the
<HI>Fribbleriad</HI>&mdash;</P>
<Q>To X, Y, Z.</Q>
<L>Indeed mo&s;t &s;everely poor <HI>Garrick</HI> you handle,</L>
<L>Not bigots damn more with their bell, book and candle;</L>
<L><PB N="viii" REF="8">
Tho' you with the town about him di&s;agree,</L>
<L>He joins with the town in their judgment of thee:</L>
<L>So dainty, &s;o dev'li&s;h, is all that you &s;cribble,</L>
<L>Not a &s;oul but can &s;ee 'tis the &s;pite of a <HI>Fribble;</HI></L>
<L>And all will expect you, when forth you &s;hall come,</L>
<L>With a <HI>round &s;mirking face,</HI> and a <HI>jut with your bum.</HI></L>
<P>If X, Y, Z, is really &s;uch a thing, as here repre&s;ent|ed,
he is mo&s;t welcome to the honour we have done
him; if he is <HI>not,</HI> he may thank his own malignant di&s;|po&s;ition,
that made it natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch
poor &s;pite could proceed from no one, who was not
in his per&s;on, manners, mind and heart an arrant
