<P>What whim is this, Maria? Why do you fly from me at &s;uch a rate?</P>

<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous Que&s;tion!&mdash;So &s;anguine, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a Lover as Captain Bellafont is might have concluded, that no Woman can have any other Motive for flying from him, but the Plea&s;ure of being pur&s;ued.</P>

<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! your mo&s;t humble Servant.&mdash;But really I am no match for you at the&s;e Weapons: The Dance you have led me over Hedge and Ditch, acro&s;s that Walk, down the next, over this Field, round the other, might be good Sport to a &s;lender, well-breath'd Stripling of a Lover; but to your Adorer, who is &s;omewhat corpu|lent, it is actually intolerable; and I do prote&s;t to you, that if you offer to &s;tir a Step further, I will ab|&s;olutely give over the Chace.</P>

<P>In&s;ufferable! Will no Submi&s;&s;ion &s;atisfy you?</P>

<P>Was your Flight a Proof of your Submi&s;&s;ion, I might be &s;atisfied; but I doubt that little rebellious Heart of yours will not be &s;ubdued upon &s;uch ea&s;y Terms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon ea&s;y Terms, depend on it I never &s;hall &s;ub|mit: I have ob&s;erv'd &s;o little Complai&s;ance after Mar|riage, that I &s;hall look to receive all my Portion of it before.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, Mr. Bellafont, as you are &s;o much de|voted to your Ea&s;e, and I am &s;o great a Lover of my Freedom, I fear we can never conveniently meet. I will venture, therefore, to take my Leave of you.&mdash;If you think fit to repo&s;e your&s;elf after your Fatigues, I wou'd recommend a Seat in that Arbour to you; or, if you rather chu&s;e to take a &s;olitary turn down that Walk, I promi&s;e you I will not interrupt your Medi|tations.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, I be&s;eech thee, Maria, if it is only 'till I can tell thee, that in Spite of all this cruel Indifference I am de&s;tined to adore thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is extremely well; but to be &s;erious for a Moment.&mdash;Allow me to a&s;k you what rea&s;onable hope you can have that my Father will ever approve of your Preten&s;ions? and without his Con&s;ent, I am apt to believe I &s;hall never be de&s;perate enough to li&s;ten to your Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Maria, &s;eriou&s;ly I have no one Rea&s;on for hoping, but that I never in my Life cou'd de|&s;pond; nor have I any Excu&s;e for the Folly of per|&s;evering in my Addre&s;&s;es, except that I love you,

and have naturally a Pa&s;&s;ion for all extravagant At|tempts. A Soldier of Fortune, the needy Son of a younger Brother, however noble his Extraction, can as ill expect to &s;ucceed with a Father of Sir Antony Withers's &s;ort, as think of a&s;piring to a Lady of Maria's Merit and Beauty.&mdash;To delineate my&s;elf to you in one Word; my Family is noble; my Profe&s;|&s;ion more &s;o; if I was not a Man of Honour I &s;hou'd not be the De&s;cendent of my Father, and if I was a Coward I cou'd not be a Briton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me, Bellafont, this may be Recommendation &s;ufficient; but my Father would a&s;k, <Q>&startq;What are your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? where lies your E&s;tate?&endq;</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have none: after having a&s;&s;i&s;ted our Conque&s;ts in every Quarter of the World, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that there is not one Foot of it which I can call my own: my Patrimony is my Sword.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very honourable Inheritance for a &s;ingle Gentle|man, but a mighty indifferent Jointure for a Wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had I the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of my Uncle Lord Loving|ton, I &s;hould with Plea&s;ure ca&s;t them at your Feet; but a Booby Cou&s;in excludes my Hopes there; and I reap no other Fruit from his Alliance, than the Con|&s;olation to &s;ee that Avarice can make the riche&s;t Man as indigent, as Fortune has made me.&mdash;But what avails all this?&mdash;I forget it is to Maria I am &s;peaking, who has the Art to de&s;troy the Peace of my Bo&s;om, without endangering her own.</P>

<P>Now cou'd I run into his Arms, but for the dear Delight of tormenting him a little longer: he has won my Heart by the noble Manner in which he re|nounces it. <STAGE>[A&s;ide.]</STAGE> Hold, Mr. Bellafont, don't let us part in this abrupt Manner; your Regards for me mu&s;t have been very in&s;incere, to be laid a&s;ide with &s;o much Indifference.</P>

Wealth and Grandeur indeed I cou'd not have endow'd thee with; but an hone&s;t and faithful Heart is an Oblation which a generous Wo|man wou'd have prefer'd before them.</P>

<P>Come, Bellafont, we have carried this Je&s;t far enough: you are really as &s;he tells you, Lord Lovington; and, if you won't take my Word for it, you may read that Paper. You will pardon a little harmle&s;s Raille|ry, and, if you are &s;erious in your E&s;teem for my Si&s;ter, I am confident my Father and his Family will think them&s;elves highly honour'd in your Lord&s;hip's Alliance.</P>

<P>By my &s;ay-&s;o, this is an Event that will make no &s;mall Figure upon Paper; I am only concern'd that my Part has not been &s;o brilliant as I cou'd wi&s;h; but I mu&s;t help that out in the Relation. This Jade Clara has cruelly di&s;arrang'd my Matters; no where to be found, either by Land or Water: Well, well, we have not drag'd the Pond for nothing. Now Fre|derick cou'd we but find where Clara,&mdash;p&s;haw&mdash;I mean where Mi&s;s Hartley has hid her&s;elf, I might di&s;po&s;e of both my Children at once. Ods Life!
