<P>I SHOULD not take the liberty to recommend a mere <HI>Poem</HI> to your attention, were it not, in &s;ome degree, <HI>&s;anctified</HI> by the &s;ubject of which it treats; and more particularly entitled to your re|gard from the great purpo&s;e it is de&s;igned to promote&mdash;For, <HI>the Project</HI> relates to <HI>Politicks;</HI> that weighty &s;cience, which, according to your candid confe&s;&s;ion, is at lea&s;t of equal importance with Religion&mdash;And the object it aims at, is the &s;ame with regard to <HI>all</HI> our political di&s;putes, as yours avowedly is upon the <HI>one</HI> great conte&s;t of the pre&s;ent times&mdash;To cut off the di&s;tempered <HI>bough,</HI> was <HI>your</HI> Project; <HI>mine</HI> &s;trikes at the very <HI>root</HI> of all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It was in con&s;equence of an attentive peru&s;al of your <HI>Tracts,</HI> that I &s;et my&s;elf to &s;earch for this <HI>grand Arcanum.</HI>&mdash;After ranging in vain through Grotius, Burlamaqui, and Puffendorf, I read thir|teen books of Monte&s;quieu's Spirit of Laws, with|out making the lea&s;t di&s;covery&mdash;But at length the fourteenth book rewarded all my toils&mdash;I need not refre&s;h your memory with the particulars of his &s;y&s;tem upon the relation between climate and na|tional character&mdash;It would, however, be great pre|&s;umption to arrogate to my&s;elf the merit of a di&s;co|very, which I owe entirely to the great Monte&s;quieu&mdash;It is from that profound Philo&s;opher that I have learnt to account for all the variations of temper, by the operation of the atmo&s;phere upon the <HI>fibres,</HI> and thence on the <HI>action,</HI> and <HI>re-action</HI> of the heart.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>By him I have been taught, that the different proportions of <HI>heat</HI> or <HI>cold</HI> produce &s;imilar degrees of cowardice or courage&mdash;&s;o that it &s;olely depends upon the <HI>latitude,</HI> whether a nation is relaxed into Turki&s;h &s;lavery, or braced and hardened to Engli&s;h freedom&mdash;Upon this foundation my Project is rai&s;ed&mdash;which I &s;ubmit to your wi&s;dom and candour&mdash;but, as mo&s;t Projectors are of a &s;anguine temper, and, as I own, I entertain no doubt of the full &s;uc|ce&s;s of <HI>my</HI> Project, I cannot conclude, without pro|te&s;ting again&s;t that <HI>Nolo Epi&s;copari</HI> which accom|panied <HI>yours</HI>&mdash;Nothing can be more oppo&s;ite to my &s;entiments than your total abjuration of all po&s;&s;ible reward for your political labours&mdash;On the contrary, I hereby mo&s;t &s;olemnly engage to receive, with great readine&s;s, any and every honourable recom|pence that the&s;e my re&s;earches may lead the King, Lords, and Commons, in the depth of their wi&s;dom to be&s;tow on me.</P>
<P>In all other political tenets, believe me,</P>
