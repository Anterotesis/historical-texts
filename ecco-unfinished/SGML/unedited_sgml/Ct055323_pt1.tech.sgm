<SALUTE>RESPECTED SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your e&s;teemed
favour of the 13th ultimo,
whereby it appeareth, that you have
peru&s;ed tho&s;e &s;ame Letters, the
which were delivered unto you by
my friend the reverend Mr. Hugo
Behn; and I am plea&s;ed to find you
think they may be printed with a
good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; in as much
as the objections you mention, I
humbly conceive, are &s;uch as may be
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
redargued, if not entirely removed&mdash;
And, fir&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, as touch|ing
what pro&s;ecutions may ari&s;e from
printing the private corre&s;pondence
of per&s;ons &s;till living, give me leave,
with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to ob&s;erve,
that the Letters in que&s;tion were not
written and &s;ent under the &s;eal of
&s;ecrecy; that they have no tendency
to the <HI>mala fama,</HI> or prejudice of
any per&s;on what&s;oever; but rather
to the information and edification of
mankind: &s;o that it becometh a &s;ort
of duty to promulgate them <HI>in u&s;um
publicum.</HI> Be&s;ides, I have con&s;ulted
Mr. Davy Higgins, an eminent at|torney
of this place, who, after due
in&s;pection and con&s;ideration, declar|eth,
That he doth not think the &s;aid
Letters contain any matter which
will be held actionable in the eye of
the law. Finally, if you and I
&s;hould come to a right under&s;tanding,
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
I do declare <HI>in verbo &s;acerdotis,</HI> that,
in ca&s;e of any &s;uch pro&s;ecution, I
will take the whole upon my own
&s;houlders, even <HI>quoad</HI> fine and impri|&s;onment,
though, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I
&s;hould not care to undergo flagella|tion:
<HI>Tam ad turpitudinem, quam ad
amaritudinem paena &s;pectans</HI>&mdash;Second|ly,
concerning the per&s;onal re&s;ent|ment
of Mr. Ju&s;tice Li&s;mahago, I
may &s;ay, <HI>non flocci facio</HI>&mdash;I would not
willingly vilipend any Chri&s;tian, if,
peradventure, he de&s;erveth that epi|thet:
albeit, I am much &s;urpri&s;ed
that more care is not taken to ex|clude
from the commi&s;&s;ion all &s;uch
vagrant foreigners as may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;|pected
of di&s;affection to our happy
con&s;titution, in church and &s;tate&mdash;
God forbid that I &s;hould be &s;o un|charitable,
as to affirm po&s;itively,
that the &s;aid Li&s;mahago is no better
than a Je&s;uit in di&s;gui&s;e; but this I
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
will a&s;&s;ert and maintain, <HI>totis viribus,</HI>
that, from the day he qualified, he
has never been once &s;een <HI>intra templi
parietes,</HI> that is to &s;ay, within the
pari&s;h church.</P>
<P>Thirdly, with re&s;pect to what
pa&s;&s;ed at Mr. Kendal's table, when
the &s;aid Li&s;mahago was &s;o brutal in
his reprehen&s;ions, I mu&s;t inform you,
my good &s;ir, that I was obliged to
retire, not by fear ari&s;ing from his
minatory reproaches, which, as I
&s;aid above, I value not of a ru&s;h;
but from the &s;udden effect produced
by a barbel's row, which I had eaten
at dinner, not knowing, that the &s;aid
row is at certain &s;ea&s;ons violently ca|thartic,
as Galen ob&s;erveth in his
chapter <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>Fourthly, and la&s;tly, with refe|rence
to the manner in which I got
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Letters, it is a cir|cum&s;tance
that concerns my own
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
con&s;cience only; &s;ufficeth it to &s;ay,
I have fully &s;atisfied the parties in
who&s;e cu&s;tody they were; and, by
this time, I hope I have al&s;o &s;a|tisfied
you in &s;uch ways, that the

convenient expedition; in which

<P>I Received yours in cour&s;e of po&s;t,
and &s;hall be glad to treat with
you for the MS. which I have de|livered
to your friend Mr. Behn; but
can by no means comply with the

uncertain&mdash;Writing is all a lottery
&mdash;I have been a lo&s;er by the works
of the greate&s;t men of the age&mdash;I
could mention particulars, and name
names; but don't chu&s;e it&mdash;The

Then there have been &s;o many let|ters

printing and publi&s;hing, and you

&mdash;You need not take the

but Methodi&s;ts and Di&s;&s;enters&mdash;Be|&s;ides,
for my own part, I am quite a
&s;tranger to that &s;ort of reading; and
the two per&s;ons, who&s;e judgment I
depended upon in the&s;e matters, are
out of the way; one is gone abroad,
carpenter of a man of war; and the
other has been &s;illy enough to ab|&s;cond,
in order to avoid a pro&s;ecu|tion
for bla&s;phemy&mdash;I'm a great lo&s;er
by his going off&mdash;He has left a ma|nual

never knew his judgment fail, but in
flying from his bread and butter on
this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>By owning you was not put in bo|dily
fear by Li&s;mahago, you pre|clude
your&s;elf from the benefit of a
good plea, over and above the ad|vantage
of binding him over. In the
late war, I in&s;erted in my evening
paper, a paragraph that came by the
po&s;t, reflecting upon the behaviour
of a certain regiment in battle. An
officer of &s;aid regiment came to my
&s;hop, and, in the pre&s;ence of my
wife and journeyman, threatened to
cut off my ears&mdash;As I exhibited
marks of bodily fear, more ways than
one, to the conviction of the bye|&s;tanders,
I bound him over; my ac|tion
lay, and I recovered. As for fla|gellation,
you have nothing to fear,
and nothing to hope, on that head&mdash;
There has been but one printer flog|ged
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
at the cart's tail the&s;e thirty
years; that was Charles Wat&s;on; and
he a&s;&s;ured me it was no more than a
flea-bite. C&mdash;S&mdash;has been threa|tened
&s;everal times by the Hou&s;e of
L&mdash;; but it came to nothing. If
an information &s;hould be moved for,
and granted again&s;t you, as the edi|tor
of tho&s;e Letters, I hope you will
have hone&s;ty and wit enough to ap|pear
and take your trial&mdash;If you
&s;hould be &s;entenced to the pillory,
your fortune is made&mdash;As times go,
that's a &s;ure &s;tep to honour and pre|ferment.
I &s;hall think my&s;elf hap|py

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t.
of Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>AS I have nothing more at heart than
to convince you I am incapable of forget|ing,
or neglecting the friend&s;hip I made
at college, I now begin that corre&s;pon|dence
<PB N="7" REF="20">
by letters, which you and I agreed,
at parting, to cultivate. I begin it &s;ooner
than I intended, that you may have it in
your power to refute any idle reports
which may be circulated to my prejudice
at Oxford, touching a fooli&s;h quarrel, in
which I have been involved on account of
my &s;i&s;ter, who had been &s;ome time &s;ettled
here in a boarding-&s;chool.&mdash;When I came
hither with my uncle and aunt (who are
our guardians) to fetch her away, I found
her a fine, tall girl, of &s;eventeen, with an
agreeable per&s;on; but remarkably &s;im|ple,
and quite ignorant of the world.
This di&s;po&s;ition, and want of experience,
had expo&s;ed her to the addre&s;&s;es of a per|&s;on
&mdash;I know not what to call him, who
had &s;een her at a play; and, with a confi|dence
and dexterity peculiar to him&s;elf,
found means to be recommended to her
acquaintance. It was by the greate&s;t ac|cident
I intercepted one of his letters; as
it was my duty to &s;tifle this corre&s;pon|dence
in its birth, I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s
to find him out, and tell him very freely
my &s;entiments of the matter. The &s;park
did not like the &s;tile I u&s;ed, and behaved
with abundance of mettle. Though his
rank in life (which, by the bye, I am
a&s;hamed to declare) did not entitle him
to much deference; yet as h$s behaviour
<PB N="8" REF="21">
was remarkably &s;pirited, I admitted him
to the privilege of a gentleman, and
&s;omething might have happened, had not
we been prevented.&mdash;In &s;hort, the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
took air, I know not how, and made
abundance of noi&s;e&mdash;recour&s;e was had to
ju&s;tice&mdash;I was obliged to give my word
and honour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to-morrow morning
we &s;et out for Bri&s;tol Wells, where I ex|pect
to hear from you by the return of
the po&s;t.&mdash;I have got into a family of
originals, whom I may one day attempt
to de&s;cribe for your amu&s;ement. My
aunt, Mrs. Tabitha Bramble, is a maiden
of forty-five, exceedingly &s;tarched, vain,
and ridiculous.&mdash;My uncle is an odd kind
of humori&s;t, always on the fret, and &s;o
unplea&s;ant in his manner, that rather
than be obliged to keep him company,
I'd re&s;ign all claim to the inheritance of
his e&s;tate.&mdash;Indeed his being tortured by
the gout may have &s;oured his temper,
and, perhaps, I may like him better on
further acquaintance: certain it is, all his
&s;ervants and neighbours in the country,
are fond of him, even to a degree of en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
the rea&s;on of which I cannot as
yet comprehend. Remember me to

<OPENER>To Mrs. JERMYN, at her hou&s;e in
Glouce&s;ter.
DEAR MADAM,</OPENER>
<P>HAVING no mother of my own, I
hope you will give me leave to di&s;burthen
my poor heart to you, who have always
acted the part of a kind parent to me,
ever &s;ince I was put under your care.&mdash;In|deed,
and indeed, my worthy governe&s;s
may believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure her, that I
never harboured a thought that was
otherwi&s;e than virtuous; and, if God will
give me grace, I &s;hall never behave &s;o as
to ca&s;t a reflection on the care you have
taken in my education. I confe&s;s I have
given ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence by my want
<PB N="10" REF="23">
of prudence and experience. I ought not
to have li&s;tened to what the young man
&s;aid; and it was my duty to have told
you all that pa&s;&s;ed, but I was a&s;hamed to
mention it; and then he behaved &s;o mo|de&s;t
and re&s;pectful, and &s;eemed to be &s;o
melancholy and timorous, that I could
not find in my heart to do any thing that
&s;hould make him mi&s;erable and de&s;perate.
As for familiarities, I do declare, I never
once allowed him the favour of a &s;alute;
and as to the few letters that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
us, they are all in my uncle's
hands, and I hope they contain nothing
contrary to innocence and honour.&mdash;I am
&s;till per&s;uaded that he is not what he ap|pears
to be: but time will di&s;cover&mdash;
mean while I will endeavour to forget a
connexion, which is &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to my
family. I have cried without cea&s;ing, and

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s LAETITIA WILLIS, at Glouce&s;ter.
MY DEAREST LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>I AM in &s;uch a fright, le&s;t this &s;hould
not come &s;afe to hand by the convey|ance
of Jarvis the carrier, that I beg
you will write me, on the receipt of it,
directing to me, under cover, to Mrs.
Winifred Jenkins, my aunt's maid, who
is a good girl, and has been &s;o kind to me
in my affliction, that I have made her my
confidant; as for Jarvis, he was very &s;hy
of taking charge of my letter and the lit|tle
parcel, becau&s;e his &s;i&s;ter Sally had like
to have lo&s;t her place on my account: in|deed
<PB N="12" REF="25">
I cannot blame the man for his cau|tion;
but I have made it worth his while.
&mdash;My dear companion and bed-fellow, it
is a grievous addition to my other misfor|tunes,
that I am deprived of your agree|able
company and conver&s;ation, at a time
when I need &s;o much the comfort of your
good humour and good &s;en&s;e; but, I
hope, the friend&s;hip we contracted at
boarding-&s;chool, will la&s;t for life&mdash;I
doubt not but on my &s;ide it will daily in|crea&s;e
and improve, as I gain experience,
and learn to know the value of a true
friend.&mdash;O, my dear Letty! what &s;hall I
&s;ay about poor Mr. Wil&s;on? I have pro|mi&s;ed
to break off all corre&s;pondence,
and, if po&s;&s;ible, to forget him: but,
alas! I begin to perceive that will not
be in my power. As it is by no means
proper that the picture &s;hould remain in
my hands, le&s;t it &s;hould be the occa&s;ion
of more mi&s;chief, I have &s;ent it to you
by this opportunity, begging you will
either keep it &s;afe till better times, or re|turn
it to Mr. Wil&s;on him&s;elf, who, I &s;up|po&s;e,
will make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee you
at the u&s;ual place. If he &s;hould be low-|&s;pirited
at my &s;ending back his picture,
you may tell him I have no occa&s;ion for
a picture, while the original continues en|graved
on my&mdash;But no; I would not
<PB N="13" REF="26">
have you tell him that neither; becau&s;e
there mu&s;t be an end of our corre&s;pon|dence

&s;ake of his own peace; and yet if he
&s;hould, he mu&s;t be a barbarous&mdash;But
'tis impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;poor Wil&s;on cannot be
fal&s;e and incon&s;tant: I be&s;eech him not
to write to me, nor attempt to &s;ee me for
&s;ome time; for, con&s;idering the re&s;ent|ment
and pa&s;&s;ionate temper of my brother
Jery, &s;uch an attempt might be attended
with con&s;equences which would make us
all mi&s;erable for life&mdash;let us tru&s;t to time
and the chapter of accidents; or rather to
that Providence which will not fail, &s;ooner
or later, to reward tho&s;e that walk in the
paths of honour and virtue.&mdash;I would of|fer
my love to the young ladies; but it
is not fit that any of them &s;hould know
you have received this letter.&mdash;If we go
to Bath, I &s;hall &s;end you my &s;imple re|marks
upon that famous center of polite
amu&s;ement, and every other place we
may chance to vi&s;it; and I flatter my&s;elf
that my dear Mi&s;s Willis will be punctu|al

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE followed your directions
with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, and might have been
upon my legs by this time, had the wea|ther
permitted me to u&s;e my &s;addle hor&s;e.
I rode out upon the Downs la&s;t Tue&s;day,
in the forenoon, when the &s;ky, as far as
the vi&s;ible horizon, was without a cloud;
but before I had gone a full mile, I was
overtaken in&s;tantaneou&s;ly by a &s;torm of
rain that wet me to the &s;kin in three mi|nutes
&mdash;whence it came the devil knows;
but it has laid me up (I &s;uppo&s;e) for one
fortnight. It makes me &s;ick to hear peo|ple
talk of the fine air upon Clifton-Downs:
how can the air be either agree|able
or &s;alutary, where the daemon of
vapours de&s;cends in a perpetual drizzle?
My confinement is the more intolerable,
as I am &s;urrounded with dome&s;tic vexa|tions.
&mdash;My niece has had a dangerous fit
of illne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by that cur&s;ed inci|dent
at Glouce&s;ter, which I mentioned in
my la&s;t.&mdash;She is a poor good-natured
&s;impleton, as &s;oft as butter, and as ea&s;ily
<PB N="15" REF="28">
melted&mdash;not that &s;he's a fool&mdash;the girl's
parts are not de&s;picable, and her educa|tion
has not been neglected; that is to
&s;ay, &s;he can write and &s;pell, and &s;peak
French, and play upon the harp&s;ichord;
then &s;he dances finely, has a good figure,
and is very well inclined; but, &s;he's de|ficient
in &s;pirit, and &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible&mdash;and
&s;o tender for&s;ooth!&mdash;truly, &s;he has got a
langui&s;hing eye, and reads romances&mdash;
Then there's her brother, '&s;quire Jery, a
pert jackanapes, full of college-petulance
and &s;elf-conceit; proud as a German
count, and as hot and ha&s;ty as a Welch
mountaineer. As for that fanta&s;tical
animal, my &s;i&s;ter Tabby, you are no
&s;tranger to her qualifications&mdash;I vow to
God, &s;he is &s;ometimes &s;o intolerable, that
I almo&s;t think &s;he's the devil incarnate
come to torment me for my &s;ins; and
yet I am con&s;cious of no &s;ins that ought
to entail &s;uch family-plagues upon me&mdash;
why the devil &s;hould not I &s;hake off the&s;e
torments at once? I an't married to Tab|by,
thank Heaven! nor did I beget the
other two: let them choo&s;e another guar|dian:
for my part, I an't in a condition
to take care of my&s;elf; much le&s;s to &s;u|perintend
the conduct of giddy-headed
boys and girls. You earne&s;tly de&s;ire to
know the particulars of our adventure at
<PB N="16" REF="29">
Glouce&s;ter, which are briefly the&s;e, and I
hope they will go no further:&mdash;Liddy
had been &s;o long cooped up in a board|ing-&s;chool,
which, next to a nunnery, is
the wor&s;t kind of &s;eminary that ever was
contrived for young women, that &s;he be|came
as inflammable as touch-wood; and
going to a play in holiday-time,&mdash;'&s;death,
I'm a&s;hamed to tell you! &s;he fell in love
with one of the actors&mdash;a hand&s;ome young
fellow that goes by the name of Wil&s;on.
The ra&s;cal &s;oon perceived the impre&s;&s;ion
he had made, and managed matters &s;o as
to &s;ee her at a hou&s;e where &s;he went to
drink tea with her governe&s;s.&mdash;This was
the beginning of a corre&s;pondence, which
they kept up by means of a jade of a mil|liner,
who made and dre&s;&s;ed caps for the
girls at the boarding-&s;chool. When we
arrived at Glouce&s;ter, Liddy came to &s;tay
at lodgings with her aunt, and Wil&s;on
bribed the maid to deliver a letter into
her own hands; but it &s;eems Jery had al|ready
acquired &s;o much credit with the
maid, (by what means he be&s;t knows)
that &s;he carried the letter to him, and &s;o
the whole plot was di&s;covered. The ra&s;h
boy, without &s;aying a word of the matter
to me, went immediately in &s;earch of
Wil&s;on; and, I &s;uppo&s;e, treated him with
in&s;olence enough. The theatrical hero
<PB N="17" REF="30">
was too far gone in romance to brook
&s;uch u&s;age: he replied in blank ver&s;e, and
a formal challenge en&s;ued. They agreed
to meet early next morning and decide
the di&s;pute with &s;word and pi&s;tol. I
heard nothing at all of the affair, 'till Mr.
Morley came to my bed-&s;ide in the morn|ing,
and told me he was afraid my
nephew was going to fight, as he had
been over-heard talking very loud and
vehement with Wil&s;on at the young man's
lodgings the night before, and afterwards
went and bought powder and ball at a
&s;hop in the neighbourhood. I got up im|mediately,
and upon inquiry found he
was ju&s;t gone out. I begged Morley to
knock up the mayor, that he might in|terpo&s;e
as a magi&s;trate, and in the mean
time I hobbled after the &s;quire, whom I
&s;aw at a di&s;tance walking at a great pace
towards the city gate&mdash;in &s;pite of all my
efforts, I could not come up 'till our two
combatants had taken their ground, and
were priming their pi&s;tols. An old hou&s;e
luckily &s;creened me from their view; &s;o
that I ru&s;hed upon them at once, before
I was perceived. They were both con|founded,
and attempted to make their
e&s;cape different ways; but Morley com|ing
up with con&s;tables at that in&s;tant,
took Wil&s;on into cu&s;tody, and Jery fol|lowed
<PB N="18" REF="31">
him quietly to the mayor's hou&s;e.
All this time I was ignorant of what had
pa&s;&s;ed the preceding day; and neither of
the parties would di&s;cover a tittle of the
matter. The mayor ob&s;erved that it was
great pre&s;umption in Wil&s;on, who was a
&s;troller, to proceed to &s;uch extremities
with a gentleman of family and fortune;
and threatened to commit him on the va|grant
act.&mdash;The young fellow bu&s;tled up
with great &s;pirit, declaring he was a gen|tleman,
and would be treated as &s;uch;
but he refu&s;ed to explain him&s;elf further.
The ma&s;ter of the company being &s;ent
for, and examined, touching the &s;aid Wil|&s;on,
&s;aid the young man had engaged
with him at Birmingham about &s;ix months
ago; but never would take his &s;alary;
that he had behaved &s;o well in his pri|vate
character, as to acquire the re&s;pect
and good-will of all his acquaintance, and
that the public owned his merit, as an
actor, was altogether extraordinary.&mdash;
After all, I fancy, he will turn out to be
a run-away prentice from London.&mdash;The
manager offered to bail him for any &s;um,
provided he would give his word and ho|nour
that he would keep the peace; but
the young gentleman was on his high
ropes, and would by no means lay him|&s;elf
under any re&s;trictions: on the other
<PB N="19" REF="32">
hand, Hopefull was equally ob&s;tinate;
till at length the mayor declared, that if
they both refu&s;ed to be bound over, he
would immediately commit Wil&s;on as a
vagrant to hard labour. I own I was
much plea&s;ed with Jery's behaviour on
this occa&s;ion: he &s;aid, that rather than
Mr. Wil&s;on &s;hould be treated in &s;uch an
ignominious manner, he would give his
word and honour to pro&s;ecute the af|fair
no further while they remained at
Glouce&s;ter&mdash;Wil&s;on thanked him for his
generous manner of proceeding, and was
di&s;charged. On our return to our lodg|ings,
my nephew explained the whole
my&s;tery; and I own I was exceedingly
incen&s;ed.&mdash;Liddy being que&s;tioned on
the &s;ubject, and very &s;everely reproach|ed
by that wild-cat my &s;i&s;ter Tabby, fir&s;t
&s;wooned away, then di&s;&s;olving in a flood
of tears, confe&s;&s;ed all the particulars of
the corre&s;pondence, at the &s;ame time giv|ing
up three letters, which was all &s;he had
received from her admirer. The la&s;t,
which Jery intercepted, I &s;end you in|clo&s;ed,
and when you have read it, I dare
&s;ay you won't wonder at the progre&s;s the
writer had made in the heart of a &s;imple
girl, utterly unacquainted with the cha|racters
of mankind. Thinking it was
high time to remove her from &s;uch a
<PB N="20" REF="33">
dangerous connexion, I carried her off the
very next day to Bri&s;tol; but the poor
creature was &s;o frightened and fluttered,
by our threats and expo&s;tulations, that
&s;he fell &s;ick the fourth day after our arri|val
at Clifton, and continued &s;o ill for a
whole week, that her life was de&s;paired
of. It was not till ye&s;terday that Dr.
Rigge declared her out of danger. You
cannot imagine what I have &s;uffered,
partly from the indi&s;cretion of this poor
child, but much more from the fear of
lo&s;ing her entirely. This air is intolera|bly
cold, and the place quite &s;olitary&mdash;
I never go down to the well without re|turning
low-&s;pirited; for there I meet
with half a dozen poor emaciated crea|tures,
with gho&s;tly looks, in the la&s;t &s;tage
of a con&s;umption, who have made &s;hift
to linger through the winter, like &s;o
many exotic plants langui&s;hing in a hot-|hou&s;e;
but, in all appearance, will drop
into their graves before the &s;un has
warmth enough to mitigate the rigour of
this ungenial &s;pring.&mdash;If you think the
Bath water will be of any &s;ervice to me, I
will go thither as &s;oon as my niece can
bear the motion of the coach.&mdash;Tell
Barns I am obliged to him for his advice;
but don't choo&s;e to follow it. If Davis
voluntarily offers to give up the farm, the

other &s;hall have it; but I will not begin
at this time of day to di&s;tre&s;s my tenants,
becau&s;e they are unfortunate, and cannot
make regular payments: I wonder that
Barns &s;hould think me capable of &s;uch
oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;As for Higgins, the fellow is
a notorious poacher, to be &s;ure; and an
impudent ra&s;cal to &s;et his &s;nares in my

thought he had &s;ome right (e&s;pecially in
my ab&s;ence) to partake of what nature

you may threaten him in my name, as
much as you plea&s;e, and if he repeats the

friends: I need not tell you to make u&s;e

to hint, that I'm more afraid of my fowl|ing
piece than of my game. When you

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Je&s;us

Hot-well, <DATE>April 18.</DATE>
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>I GIVE Man&s;el credit for his inven|tion,
in propagating the report that I
had a quarrel with a mountebank's merry
Andrew at Glouce&s;ter: but I have too
much re&s;pect for every appendage of wit,
<PB N="25" REF="38">
to quarrel even with the lowe&s;t buffoone|ry;
and therefore I hope Man&s;el and I
&s;hall always be good friends. I cannot,
however, approve of his drowning my
poor dog Ponto, on purpo&s;e to convert
Ovid's pleona&s;m into a punning epitaph.
&mdash;<HI>deerant quoque Littora Ponto:</HI> for, that he
threw him into the I&s;is, when it was &s;o
high and impetous, with no other view
than to kill the fleas, is an excu&s;e that
will not hold water&mdash;But I leave poor
Ponto to his fate, and hope Providence
will take care to accommodate Man&s;el
with a drier death.</P>
<P>As there is nothing that can be called
company at the Well, I am here in a
&s;tate of ab&s;olute ru&s;tication: This, how|ever,
gives me lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the &s;in|gularities
in my uncle's character, which
&s;eems to have intere&s;ted your curio&s;ity.
The truth is, his di&s;po&s;ition and mine,
which, like oil and vinegar, repelled one
another at fir&s;t, have now begun to mix
by dint of being beat up together. I was
once apt to believe him a complete Cynic;
and that nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of his
occa&s;ions could compel him to get with|in
the pale of &s;ociety&mdash;I am now of an|other
opinion. I think his peevi&s;hne&s;s a|ri&s;es
partly from bodily pain, and partly
<PB N="26" REF="39">
from a natural exce&s;s of mental &s;en&s;ibility;
for, I &s;uppo&s;e, the mind as well as the
body, is in &s;ome ca&s;es endued with a
morbid exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>I was t'other day much diverted with a
conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed in the Pump-room,
betwixt him and the famous Dr.
L&mdash;n, who is come to ply at the Well
for patients. My uncle was complaining
of the &s;tink, occa&s;ioned by the va&s;t quan|tity
of mud and &s;lime, which the river
leaves at low ebb under the windows of
the Pump-room. He ob&s;erved, that the
exhalations ari&s;ing from &s;uch a nui&s;ance,
could not but be prejudicial to the weak
lungs of many con&s;umptive patients, who
came to drink the water. The Doctor
overhearing this remark, made up to
him, and a&s;&s;ured him he was mi&s;taken.
He &s;aid, people in general were &s;o mi&s;|led
by vulgar prejudices, that philo&s;o|phy
was hardly &s;ufficient to undeceive
them. Then humming thrice, he a&s;&s;um|ed
a mo&s;t ridiculous &s;olemnity of a&s;pect,
and entered into a learned inve&s;tigation
of the nature of &s;tink. He ob&s;erved,
that &s;tink, or &s;tench, meant no more than
a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the olfactory
nerves; and might be applied to &s;ub&s;tan|ces
of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite qualities; that
<PB N="27" REF="40">
in the Dutch language, <HI>&s;tinken</HI> &s;ignified
the mo&s;t agreeable perfume, as well as the

as arbitrary as the opinion of
beauty; that the French were plea&s;ed
with the putrid effluvia of animal food;
and &s;o were the Hottentots in Africa, and
the Savages in Greenland; and that the
Negroes on the coa&s;t of Senegal would

pre&s;umptions in favour of what is gene|rally
called <HI>&s;tink,</HI> as tho&s;e nations are in a
&s;tate of nature, undebauched by luxury,
un&s;educed by whim and caprice: that he
had rea&s;on to believe the &s;tercoraceous fla|vour,
condemned by prejudice as a &s;tink,
was, in fact, mo&s;t agreeable to the or|gans
of &s;melling; for, that every per&s;on
who pretended to nau&s;eate the &s;mell of
another's excretions, &s;nuffed up his own

the inhabitants of Madrid and Edin|burgh
<PB N="28" REF="41">
found particular &s;atisfaction in
breathing their own atmo&s;phere, which
was always impregnated with &s;tercora|ceous
effluvia: that the learned Dr. B&mdash;,
in his treati&s;e on the Four Dige&s;tions, ex|plains
in what manner the volatile efflu|via
from the inte&s;tines, &s;timulate and
promote the operations of the animal
oeconomy: he affirmed, the la&s;t Grand
Duke of Tu&s;cany, of the <HI>Medicis</HI> family,
who refined upon &s;en&s;uality with the &s;pi|rit
of a philo&s;opher, was &s;o delighted
with that odour, that he cau&s;ed the e&s;|&s;ence
of ordure to be extracted, and u&s;ed
it as the mo&s;t delicious perfume: that he
him&s;elf, (the doctor) when he happened
to be low-&s;pirited, or fatigued with bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
found immediate relief and uncom|mon
&s;atisfaction from hanging over the
&s;tale contents of a clo&s;e-&s;tool, while his
&s;ervant &s;tirred it about under his no&s;e;
nor was this effect to be wondered at,
when we con&s;ider that this &s;ub&s;tance
abounds with the &s;elf-&s;ame volatile &s;alts
that are &s;o greedily &s;melled to by the
mo&s;t delicate invalids, after they have
been extracted and &s;ublimed by the che|mi&s;ts.&mdash;By
this time the company be|gan
to hold their no&s;es; but the doctor,
without taking the lea&s;t notice of this &s;ig|nal,
<PB N="29" REF="42">
proceeded to &s;hew, that many fetid
&s;ub&s;tances were not only agreeable but
&s;alutary; &s;uch as <HI>a&s;&s;afetida,</HI> and other me|dicinal
gums, re&s;ins, roots, and vegeta|bles,
over and above burnt feathers, tan|pits,
candle-&s;nuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In &s;hort, he
u&s;ed many learned arguments to per&s;uade
his audience out of their &s;en&s;es; and from
<HI>&s;tench</HI> made a tran&s;ition to <HI>filth,</HI> which
he affirmed was al&s;o a mi&s;taken idea, in
as much as objects &s;o called, were no other
than certain modifications of matter, con|&s;i&s;ting
of the &s;ame principles that enter in|to
the compo&s;ition of all created e&s;&s;ences,
whatever they may be: that in the
filthie&s;t production of nature, a philo&s;o|pher
con&s;idered nothing but the earth,
water, &s;alt, and air of which it was com|pounded;
that, for his own part, he had
no more objection to drinking the dirtie&s;t
ditch water, than he had to a gla&s;s of wa|ter
from the Hot Well, provided he was
a&s;&s;ured there was nothing poi&s;onous in
the concrete. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
to my uncle, &startq;Sir, (&s;aid he) you &s;eem
to be of a drop&s;ical habit, and proba|bly
will &s;oon have a confirmed <HI>a&s;cites:</HI>
if I &s;hould be pre&s;ent when you are
tapped, I will give you a convincing
proof of what I a&s;&s;ert, by drinking
<PB N="30" REF="43">
without he&s;itation the water that comes
out of your abdomen.&endq;&mdash;The ladies
made wry faces at this declaration, and
my uncle, changing colour, told him he
did not de&s;ire any &s;uch proof of his phi|lo&s;ophy:
&startq;But I &s;hould be glad to
know (&s;aid he) what makes you think
I am of a drop&s;ical habit?&endq; &startq;Sir, I
beg pardon, (replied the doctor) I per|ceive
your ancles are &s;welled, and you
&s;eem to have the <HI>facies leucophlegmatica.</HI>
Perhaps, indeed, your di&s;order may be
<HI>$e$ematous,</HI> or gouty, or it may be the
<HI>lues venerea:</HI> If you have any rea&s;on
to flatter your&s;elf it is this la&s;t, &s;ir, I
will undertake to cure you with three
&s;mall pills, even if the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould
have attained its utmo&s;t inveteracy.
Sir, it is an arcanum which I have di&s;|covered,
and prepared with infinite la|bour.&mdash;Sir,
I have lately cured a wo|man
in Bri&s;tol&mdash;a common pro&s;titute,
&s;ir, who had got all the wor&s;t &s;ymp|toms
of the di&s;order; &s;uch as <HI>nodi, to|phi,</HI>
and <HI>gummata, verrucae, cri&s;tae
Galli,</HI> and a <HI>&s;erpiginous</HI> eruption, or
rather a pocky itch all over her body.
&mdash;By that time &s;he had taken the
&s;econd pill, &s;ir, by Heaven! &s;he was
as &s;mooth as my hand, and the third
<PB N="31" REF="44">
made her as &s;ound and as fre&s;h as a
new born infant.&endq; &startq;Sir, (cried my
uncle peevi&s;hly) I have no rea&s;on to
flatter my&s;elf that my di&s;order comes
within the efficacy of your no&s;t$um.
But, this patient you talk of, may not
be &s;o &s;ound at bottom as you ima|gine.&endq;
&startq;I can't po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken:
(rejoined the philo&s;opher) for I have
had communication with her three
times&mdash;I always a&s;certain my cures in
that manner.&endq; At this remark, all the
ladies retired to another corner of the
room, and &s;ome of them began to &s;pit.&mdash;
As to my uncle, though he was ruffled at
fir&s;t by the doctor's &s;aying he was drop&s;i|cal,
he could not help &s;miling at this ri|diculous
confe&s;&s;ion, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, with
a view to puni&s;h this original, told him
there was a wart upon his no&s;e, that
looked a little &s;u&s;picious. &startq;I don't pre|tend
to be a judge of tho&s;e matters;
(&s;aid he) but I under&s;tand that warts
are often produced by the di&s;temper;
and that one upon your no&s;e &s;eems to
have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the very key|&s;tone
of the bridge, which I hope is in
no danger of falling.&endq; L&mdash;n &s;eem|ed
a little confounded at this remark, and
a&s;&s;ured him it was nothing but a com|mon
<PB N="32" REF="45">
excre&s;cence of the cuticula, but that
the bones w$$e all &s;ound below; for the
truth of this a&s;&s;ertion he appealed to the
touch, de&s;iring he would feel the part.
My uncle &s;aid it was a matter of &s;uch de|licacy
to meddle with a gentleman's no&s;e,
that he declined the office&mdash;upon which,
the Doctor turning to me, intreated me
to do him that favour. I complied with
his reque&s;t, and handled it &s;o roughly,
that he &s;neezed, and the tears ran down
his cheeks, to the no &s;mall entertainment
of the company, and particularly of my
uncle, who bur&s;t out a-laughing for the
fir&s;t time &s;ince I have been with him;
and took notice, that the part &s;eemed to
be very tender. &startq;Sir, (cried the Doc|tor)
it is naturally a tender part; but
to remove all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, I
will take off the wart this very
night.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he bowed with great &s;olem|nity
all round, and retired to his own
lodgings, where he applied cau&s;tic to the
wart; but it &s;pread in &s;uch a manner as
to produce a con&s;iderable inflammation,
attended with an enormous &s;welling; &s;o
that when he next appeared, his whole
face was over&s;hadowed by this tremen|dous
nozzle; and the rueful eagerne&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="46">
with which he explained this unlucky
accident, was ludicrous beyond all de|&s;cription.
&mdash;I was much plea&s;ed with
meeting the original of a character, which
you and I have often laughed at in de|&s;cription;
and what &s;urprizes me very
much, I find the features in the picture,
which has been drawn for him, rather
&s;oftened than over-charged.&mdash;</P>
<P>As I have &s;omething el&s;e to &s;ay; and
this letter has run to an uncon&s;cionable
length, I &s;hall now give you a little re|&s;pite,
and trouble you again by the very

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
Hot Well, <DATE>April 20.</DATE>
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I NOW &s;it down to execute the
threat in the tail of my la&s;t. The truth
is, I am big with the &s;ecret, and long to
be delivered. It relates to my guardian,
who, you know, is at pre&s;ent our prin|cipal
object in view.</P>
<P>T'other day, I thought I had detected
him in &s;uch a &s;tate of frailty, as would
but ill become his years and character.
There is a decent &s;ort of a woman, not
di&s;agreeable in her per&s;on, that comes to
the Well, with a poor emaciated child,
far gone in a con&s;umption. I had caught
my uncle's eyes &s;everal times directed to
this per&s;on, with a very &s;u&s;picious ex|pre&s;&s;ion
in them, and every time he &s;aw
him&s;elf ob&s;erved, he ha&s;tily withdrew
them, with evident marks of confu&s;ion&mdash;
I re&s;olved to watch him more narrowly,
<PB N="35" REF="48">
and &s;aw him &s;peaking to her privately in
a corner of the walk. At length, going
down to the Well one day, I met her
half way up the hill to Clifton, and
could not help &s;u&s;pecting &s;he was going
to our lodgings by appointment, as it was
about one o'clock, the hour when my
&s;i&s;ter and I are generally at the Pump-room.
&mdash;This notion exciting my curio&s;i|ty,
I returned by a back way, and got
unperceived into my own chamber, which
is contiguous to my uncle's apartment.
Sure enough, the woman was introduced,
but not into his bed-chamber; he gave
her audience in a parlour; &s;o that I was
obliged to &s;hift my &s;tation to another
room, where, however, there was a &s;mall
chink in the partition, through which I
could perceive what pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;My uncle,
though a little lame, ro&s;e up when &s;he
came in, and &s;etting a chair for her, de|&s;ired
&s;he would &s;it down: then he a&s;ked
if &s;he would take a di&s;h of chocolate,
which &s;he declined, with much acknow|ledgment.
After a &s;hort pau&s;e, he &s;aid,
in a croaking tone of voice, which con|founded
me not a little, &startq;Madam, I am
truly concerned for your misfortunes;
and if this trifle can be of any $word$
to you, I beg you will accept it with|out
<PB N="36" REF="49">
ceremony.&endq; So &s;aying, he put a
bit of paper into her hand, which &s;he
opening with great trepidation, exclaim|ed
in an extacy, &startq;Twenty pounds! O,
&s;ir!&endq; and &s;inking down upon a &s;ettee,
fainted away&mdash;Frightened at this fit, and,
I &s;uppo&s;e, afraid of calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
le&s;t her &s;ituation &s;hould give ri&s;e to un|favourable
conjectures, he ran about the
room in di&s;traction, making frightful
grimaces; and, at length, had recollec|tion
enough to throw a little water in her
face; by which application &s;he was
brought to her&s;elf: but, then her feeling
took another turn. She &s;hed a flood of
tears, and cried aloud, &startq;I know not
who you are: but, &s;ure&mdash;worthy
&s;ir!&mdash;generous &s;ir!&mdash;the di&s;tre&s;s of me
and my poor dying child&mdash;Oh! if the
widow's prayers&mdash;if the orphan's tears
of gratitude can ought avail&mdash;gracious
Providence!&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ings! &s;hower down
eternal ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;&endq; Here &s;he was in|terrupted
by my uncle, who muttered in
a voice &s;till more and more di&s;cordant,
&startq;For Heaven's &s;ake be quiet, madam&mdash;
con&s;ider&mdash;the people of the hou&s;e&mdash;
'&s;death! can't you&mdash;&endq; All this time
&s;he was &s;truggling to throw her&s;elf on her
knees, while he &s;eizing her by the wri&s;ts,
<PB N="37" REF="50">
endeavoured to &s;eat her upon the &s;ettee,
&s;aying, &startq;Pr'ythee&mdash;good now&mdash;hold
your tongue&mdash;&endq; At that in&s;tant, who
&s;hould bur&s;t into the room but our aunt
Tabby! of all antiquated maidens the
mo&s;t diabolically capricious&mdash;Ever pry|ing
into other people's affairs, &s;he had
&s;een the woman enter, and followed her
to the door, where &s;he &s;tood li&s;tening,
but probably could hear nothing di&s;tinc|ly,
except my uncle's la&s;t exclamation;
at which &s;he bounced into the parlour in
a violent rage, that dyed the tip of her
no&s;e of a purple hue,&mdash;&startq;Fy upon you,
Matt! (cried &s;he) what doings are
the&s;e, to di&s;grace your own character,
and di&s;parage your family?&mdash;&endq; Then,
&s;natching the bank-note out of the &s;tran|ger's
hand, &s;he went on&mdash;&startq;How now,
twenty pounds!&mdash;here is temptation
with a witne&s;s!&mdash;Good-woman, go
about your bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;Brother, bro|ther,
I know not which mo&s;t to ad|mire;
your concupi&s;&s;ins, or your ex|travagance!&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Good God, (ex|claimed
the poor woman) &s;hall a wor|thy
gentleman's character &s;uffer for an
action, that does honour to humani|ty?&endq;
By this time, uncle's indignation
was effectually rou&s;ed. His face grew
<PB N="38" REF="51">
pale, his teeth chattered, and his eyes
fla&s;hed&mdash;&startq;Si&s;ter, (cried he, in a voice
like thunder) I vow to God, your im|pertinence
is exceedingly provoking.&endq;
With the&s;e words, he took her by the
hand, and, opening the door of commu|nication,
thru&s;t her into the chamber
where I &s;tood, &s;o affected by the &s;cene,
that the tears ran down my cheeks. Ob|&s;erving
the&s;e marks of emotion, &startq;I don't
wonder (&s;aid &s;he) to &s;ee you concerned
at the back-&s;lidings of &s;o near a rela|tion;
a man of his years and infirmi|ties:
The&s;e are fine doings, truly&mdash;
This is a rare example, &s;et by a guar|dian,
for the benefit of his pupils&mdash;
Mon&s;trous! incongrous! &s;ophi&s;tical!&endq;
&mdash;I thought it was but an act of ju&s;tice
to &s;et her to rights; and therefore ex|plained
the my&s;tery&mdash;But &s;he would not
be undeceived. &startq;What! (&s;aid &s;he)
would you go for to offer, for to ar|gue&s;y
me out of my &s;en&s;es? Did'n't I
hear him whi&s;pering to her to hold her
tongue? Did'n't I &s;ee her in tears?
Did'n't I &s;ee him &s;truggling to throw
her upon the couch? O filthy! hide|ous!
abominable! Child, child, talk
not to me of charity.&mdash;Who gives
twenty pounds in charity?&mdash;But you
<PB N="39" REF="52">
are a &s;tripling&mdash;You know nothing of
the world&mdash;Be&s;ides, charity begins at
home&mdash;Twenty pounds would buy me
a complete &s;uit of flowered &s;ilk, trim|mings
and all&mdash;&endq; In &s;hort, I quitted
the room, my contempt for her, and my
re&s;pect for her brother, being increa&s;ed in
the &s;ame proportion. I have &s;ince been
informed, that the per&s;on, whom my
uncle &s;o generou&s;ly relieved, is the wi|dow
of an en&s;ign, who has nothing to
depend upon but the pen&s;ion of fifteen
pounds a year. The people of the Well-hou&s;e
give her an excellent character.
She lodges in a garret, and works very
hard at plain-work, to &s;upport her
daughter, who is dying of a con&s;ump|tion.
I mu&s;t own, to my &s;hame, I feel
a &s;trong inclination to follow my uncle's
example, in relieving this poor widow;
but, betwixt friends, I am afraid of be|ing
detected in a weakne&s;s, that might
entail the ridicule of the company

Hot Well, <DATE>April 20.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I UNDERSTAND your hint. There
are my&s;teries in phy&s;ick, as well as in
religion; which we of the profane have
no right to inve&s;tigate&mdash;A man mu&s;t not
pre&s;ume to u&s;e his rea&s;on, unle&s;s he has
&s;tudied the categories, and can chop lo|gic
by mode and figure&mdash;Between friends,
I think, every man of tolerable parts
ought, at my time of day, to be both
phy&s;ician and lawyer, as far as his own
con&s;titution and property are concerned.
For my own part, I have had an ho&s;pital
the&s;e fourteen years within my&s;elf, and
&s;tudied my own ca&s;e with the mo&s;t pain|ful
attention; con&s;equently may be &s;up|po&s;ed
to know &s;omething of the matter,
although I have not taken regular cour&s;es
of phy&s;iology <HI>et cete$a et cetera.</HI>&mdash;In

(no offence, dear Doctor) that the
&s;um of all your medical di&s;coveries
<PB N="41" REF="54">
amounts to this, that the more you
&s;tudy the le&s;s you know.&mdash;I have read all
that has been written on the Hot Wells,
and what I can collect from the whole, is,
that the water contains nothing but a lit|tle
&s;alt, and calcarious earth, mixed in
&s;uch incon&s;iderable proportion, as can
have very little, if any, effect on the ani|mal
oeconomy. This being the ca&s;e, I
think, the man de&s;erves to be fitted with
a cap and bells, who, for &s;uch a paltry
advantage as this &s;pring affords, &s;acri|fices
his precious time, which might be
employed in taking more effectual reme|dies,
and expo&s;es him&s;elf to the dirt, the
&s;tench, the chilling bla&s;ts, and perpetual
rains, that render this place to me intolera|ble.
If the&s;e waters, from a &s;mall degree of

oddity, one of your brethren, who
harrangues every day in the Pump-room,
as if he was hired to give lectures on all

&s;hrewd remarks; at other times, he talks
like the greate&s;t &s;impleton in nature&mdash;He
has read a great deal; but without me|thod

He believes every thing he has read; e&s;pe|cially
if it has any thing of the marvelous
in it; and his conver&s;ation is a &s;urprizing
hotch-potch of erudition and extrava|gance.
&mdash;He told me t'other day, with
great confidence, that my ca&s;e was drop|&s;ical;
or, as he called it, <HI>l$uc$phlegmatic:</HI>
A &s;ure &s;ign, that his want of experience

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s LETTY WILLIS, at Glouce&s;ter.
Hot Well, <DATE>April 21.</DATE>
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>I DID not intend to trouble you again,
till we &s;hould be &s;ettled at Bath; but
having the occa&s;ion of Jarvis, I could
not let it &s;lip, e&s;pecially as I have &s;ome|thing
extraordinary to communicate&mdash;O,
my dear companion! What &s;hall I tell
you? for &s;everal days pa&s;t there was a
Jew-looking man, that plied at the Wells
with a box of &s;pectacles; and he always
eyed me &s;o earne&s;tly, that I began to be
very unea&s;y. At la&s;t, he came to our
lodgings at Clifton, and lingered about
the door, as if he wanted to &s;peak to
&s;omebody&mdash;I was &s;eized with an odd
kind of fluttering, and begged Win to
throw her&s;elf in his way: but the poor
girl has weak nerves, and was afraid of
his beard. My uncle, having occa&s;ion
for new gla&s;&s;es, called him up &s;tairs, and
was trying a pair of &s;pectacles, when the
<PB N="46" REF="59">
man, advancing to me, &s;aid, in a whi&s;|per
&mdash;O gracious! what d'ye think he
&s;aid?&mdash;&startq;I am Wil&s;on!&endq; His features
&s;truck me that very moment&mdash;it was
Wil&s;on, &s;ure enough! but &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed,
that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to
know him, if my heart had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted in
the di&s;covery. I was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;o
frightened, that I fainted away; but &s;oon
recovered; and found my&s;elf &s;upported
by him on the chair, while my uncle was
running about the room, with the &s;pec|tacles
on his no&s;e, calling for help. I
had no opportunity to &s;peak to him; but
our looks were &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive. He
was payed for his gla&s;&s;es, and went away.
Then I told Win who he was, and &s;ent
her after him to the Pump-room; where
&s;he &s;poke to him, and begged him in my
name to withdraw from the place, that
he might not incur the &s;u&s;picion of my
uncle or my brother, if he did not want
to &s;ee me die of terror and vexation. The
poor youth declared, with tears in his
eyes, that he had &s;omething extraordina|ry
to communicate; and a&s;ked, if &s;he
would deliver a letter to me: but this &s;he
ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, by my order.&mdash;Find|ing
her ob&s;tinate in her refu&s;al, he de&s;ir|ed
&s;he would tell me, that he was no lon|ger
<PB N="47" REF="60">
a player, but a gentleman; in which
character he would very &s;oon avow his
pa&s;&s;ion for me, without fear of cen&s;ure or
reproach&mdash;Nay, he even di&s;covered his
name and family; which, to my great
grief, the &s;imple girl forgot, in the confu&s;i|on
occa&s;ioned by her being &s;een talking to
him by my brother; who &s;topt her on the
road, and a&s;ked what bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had
with that ra&s;cally Jew&mdash;She pretended &s;he
was cheapening a &s;tay-hook; but was
thrown into &s;uch a quandary, that &s;he for|got
the mo&s;t material part of the infor|mation;
and when &s;he came home, went
into an hy&s;teric fit of laughing. This
tran&s;action happened three days ago, dur|ing
which he has not appeared; &s;o that I
&s;uppo&s;e he is gone. Dear Letty! you &s;ee
how Fortune takes plea&s;ure in per&s;ecut|ing
your poor friend. If you &s;hould &s;ee
him at Glouce&s;ter&mdash;or if you have &s;een
him, and know his real name and family,
pray keep me no longer in &s;u&s;pence&mdash;
And yet, if he is under no obligation to
keep him&s;elf longer concealed, and has
a real affection for me, I &s;hould hope he
will, in a little time, declare him&s;elf to
my relations. Sure, if there is nothing
un&s;uitable in the match, they won't be
&s;o cruel as to thwart my inclinations&mdash;O
<PB N="48" REF="61">
what happine&s;s would then be my por|tion!
I can't help indulging the thought,
and plea&s;ing my fancy with &s;uch agree|able
ideas; which, after all, perhaps,
will never be reali&s;ed&mdash;But, why &s;hould
I de&s;pair? who knows what will happen?
&mdash;We &s;et out for Bath to-morrow, and I
am almo&s;t &s;orry for it; as I begin to be
in love with &s;olitude, and this is a
charming romantic place. The air is &s;o
pure; the Downs are &s;o agreeable; the
furze in full blo&s;&s;om; the ground enamel|led
with dai&s;ies, and primro&s;es, and cow|&s;lips;
all the trees bur&s;ting into leaves,
and the hedges already clothed with their
vernal livery; the mountains covered
with flocks of &s;heep, and tender bleating
wanton lambkins playing, fri&s;king and
&s;kipping from &s;ide to &s;ide; the groves
re&s;ound with the notes of black-bird,
thru&s;h, and linnet; and all night long
&s;weet Philomel pours forth her ravi&s;h|ingly
delightful &s;ong. Then, for varie|ty,
we go down to the <HI>nymph of Bri&s;tol
&s;pring,</HI> where the company is a&s;&s;embled be|fore
dinner; &s;o good-natured, &s;o free, &s;o

clear, &s;o pure, &s;o mild, &s;o charmingly
mauki&s;h. There the &s;un is &s;o chearful
and reviving; the weather &s;o &s;oft; the

walk &s;o agreeable; the pro&s;pect &s;o amu&s;|ing;
and the &s;hips and boats going up
and down the river, clo&s;e under the win|dows
of the Pump-room, afford &s;uch an
enchanting variety of moving pictures, as
require a much abler pen than mine to
de&s;cribe. To make this place a perfect
paradi&s;e to me, nothing is wanting but an
agreeable companion and &s;incere friend;

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Je&s;us
college, Oxon.
Bath, <DATE>April 24.</DATE>
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>YOU have, indeed, rea&s;on to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
that I &s;hould have concealed my
corre&s;pondence with mi&s;s Blackerby from
you, to whom I di&s;clo&s;ed all my other
connexions of that nature; but the truth
is, I never dreamed of any &s;uch com|merce,
till your la&s;t informed me, that it
had produced &s;omething which could
not be much longer concealed. It is a
lucky circum&s;tance, however, that her
reputation will not &s;uffer any detriment,
but rather derive advantage from the di&s;|covery;
which will prove, at lea&s;t, that
it is not quite &s;o rotten, as mo&s;t people
imagined&mdash;For my own part, I declare to
you, in all the &s;incerity of friend&s;hip,
that, far from having any amorous inter|cour&s;e
with the object in que&s;tion, I ne|ver
<PB N="51" REF="64">
had the lea&s;t acquaintance with her
per&s;on; but, if &s;he is really in the con|dition
you de&s;cribe, I &s;u&s;pect Man&s;el to
be at the bottom of the whole. His vi|&s;its
to that &s;hrine were no &s;ecret; and
this attachment, added to &s;ome good of|fices,
which you know he has done me,
&s;ince I left <HI>Alma-mater,</HI> give me a right
to believe him capable of &s;addling me
with this &s;candal, when my back was
turned&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, if my name can
be of any &s;ervice to him, he is welcome
to make u&s;e of it; and if the woman
&s;hould be abandoned enough to &s;wear his
bantling to me, I mu&s;t beg the favour of
you to compound with the pari&s;h: I &s;hall
pay the penalty without repining; and
you will be &s;o good as to draw upon me
immediately for the &s;um required&mdash;On
this occa&s;ion, I act by the advice of my
uncle; who &s;ays, I &s;hall have good-luck
if I pa&s;s through life without being oblig|ed
to make many more compo&s;itions of
the &s;ame kind. The old gentleman told
me la&s;t night, with great good-humour,
that betwixt the age of twenty and forty,
he had been obliged to provide for nine
ba&s;tards, &s;worn to him by women whom
he never &s;aw&mdash;Mr. Bramble's character,
which &s;eems to intere&s;t you greatly, opens
<PB N="52" REF="65">
and improves upon me every day.&mdash;His
&s;ingularities afford a rich mine of enter|tainment:
his under&s;tanding, &s;o far as I
can judge, is well cultivated: his ob&s;er|vations
on life are equally ju&s;t, perti|nent,
and uncommon. He affects mi&s;an|throphy,
in order to conceal the &s;en&s;ibi|lity
of a heart, which is tender, even to
a degree of weakne&s;s. This delicacy of
feeling, or &s;orene&s;s of the mind, makes
him timorous and fearful; but then he is
afraid of nothing &s;o much as of di&s;ho|nour;
and although he is exceedingly
cautious of giving offence, he will fire at
the lea&s;t hint of in&s;olence or ill-breeding.
&mdash;Re&s;pectable as he is, upon the whole,
I can't help being &s;ometimes diverted by
his little di&s;tre&s;&s;es; which provoke him
to let fly the &s;hafts of his &s;atire, keen
and penetrating as the arrows of Teucer
&mdash;Our aunt, Tabitha, acts upon him as
a perpetual grind-&s;tone&mdash;She is, in all re|&s;pects,
a &s;triking contra&s;t to her brother&mdash;
But I re&s;erve her portrait for another oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Three days ago we came hither from
the Hot Well, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
fir&s;t floor of a lodging-hou&s;e, on the
South Parade; a &s;ituation which my un|cle
cho&s;e, for its being near the Bath, and
<PB N="53" REF="66">
remote from the noi&s;e of carriages. He
was &s;carce warm in the lodgings when he
called for his night cap, his wide &s;hoes,
and flannel; and declared him&s;elf inve&s;t|ed
with the gout in his right foot;
though, I believe, it had as yet reached
no farther than his imagination. It was
not long before he had rea&s;on to repent
his premature declaration; for our aunt
Tabitha found means to make &s;uch a cla|mour
and confu&s;ion, before the flannels
could be produced from the trunk, that
one would have imagined the hou&s;e was
on fire. All this time, uncle &s;at boiling
with impatience, biting his fingers,
throwing up his eyes, and muttering eja|culations;
at length he bur&s;t into a kind
of convul&s;ive laugh, after which he hum|med
a &s;ong; and when the hurricane was
over, exclaimed, &startq;Ble&s;&s;ed be God for
all things!&endq; This, however, was but
the beginning of his troubles. Mrs. Ta|bitha's
favourite dog Chowder, having
paid his compliments to a female turn|&s;pit,
of his own &s;pecies, in the kitchen,
involved him&s;elf in a quarrel with no
fewer than five rivals, who &s;et upon him
at once, and drove him up &s;tairs to the
dining-room door, with hideous noi&s;e:
there our aunt and her woman, taking
<PB N="54" REF="67">
arms in his defence, joined the concert;
which became truly diabolical. This
fray being with difficulty &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by
the intervention of our own foot-man and
the cook maid of the hou&s;e, the '&s;quire
had ju&s;t opened his mouth, to expo&s;tulate
with Tabby, when the town-waits, in the
pa&s;&s;age below, &s;truck up their mu&s;ick,
(if mu&s;ick it may be called) with &s;uch a
&s;udden bur&s;t of &s;ound, as made him &s;tart
and &s;tare, with marks of indignation and
di&s;quiet. He had recollection enough to
&s;end his &s;ervant with &s;ome money to
&s;ilence tho&s;e noi&s;y intruders; and they
were immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, though not
without &s;ome oppo&s;ition on the part of
Tabitha, who thought it but rea&s;onable
that he &s;hould have more mu&s;ick for his
money. Scarce had he &s;ettled this knot|ty
point, when a &s;trange kind of thump|ing
and bouncing was heard right over|head,
in the &s;econd &s;tory, &s;o loud and
violent as to &s;hake the whole building.
I own I was exceedingly provoked at this
new alarm; and before my uncle had
time to expre&s;s him&s;elf on the &s;ubject, I
ran up &s;tairs, to &s;ee what was the matter.
Finding the room-door open, I entered
without ceremony, and perceived an ob|ject,
which I cannot now recollect with|out
<PB N="55" REF="68">
laughing to exce&s;s&mdash;It was a dan|cing
ma&s;ter, with his &s;cholar, in the act
of teaching. The ma&s;ter was blind of
one eye, and lame of one foot, and led
about the room his pupil; who &s;eemed to
be about the age of three-&s;core, &s;tooped
mortally, was tall, raw-boned, hard-favoured,
with a woollen night-cap on
his head; and he had &s;tript off his coat,
that he might be more nimble in his mo|tions
&mdash;Finding him&s;elf intruded upon,
by a per&s;on he did not know, he forth|with
girded him&s;elf with a long iron
&s;word, and advancing to me, with a pe|remptory
air, pronounced, in a true Hi|bernian
accent, &startq;Mi&s;ter What d'ye cal|lum,
by my &s;aoul and con&s;cience, I
am very glad to &s;ea you, if you are af|ter
coming in the way of friend&s;hip;
and indeed, and indeed now, I believe
you are my friend &s;ure enough, gra;
though I never had the honour to &s;ea
your face before, my dear; for be|caa&s;e
you come like a friend, without
any ceremony at all, at all&mdash;&endq; I told
him the nature of my vi&s;it would not ad|mit
of ceremony; that I was come to de|&s;ire
he would make le&s;s noi&s;e, as there
was a &s;ick gentleman below, whom he
had no right to di&s;turb with &s;uch prepo&s;|terous
<PB N="56" REF="69">
doings. &startq;Why, look-ye now,
young gentleman, (replied this origi|nal)
perhaps, upon another occa&s;ion,
I might &s;hivilly reque&s;t you to explain
the maining of that hard word, <HI>prepa&s;|terous:</HI>
but there's a time for all things,
honey&mdash;&endq; So &s;aying, he pa&s;&s;ed me with
great agility, and, running down &s;tairs,
found our foot-man at the dining-room
door, of whom he demanded admittance,
to pay his re&s;pects to the &s;tranger. As
the fellow did not think proper to refu&s;e
the reque&s;t of &s;uch a formidable figure,
he was immediately introduced, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to my uncle in the&s;e
words: &startq;Your humble &s;ervant, good &s;ir
&mdash;I'm not &s;o <HI>prepa&s;terous,</HI> as your &s;on
calls it, but I know the rules of &s;hivi|lity
&mdash;I'm a poor knight of Ireland, my
name is &s;ir Ulic Mackilligut, of the
county of Galway; being your fellow-lodger,
I'm come to pay my re&s;pects,
and to welcome you to the South Pa|rade,
and to offer my be&s;t &s;ervices to
you, and your good lady, and your
pretty daughter; and even to the
young gentleman your &s;on, though he
thinks me a <HI>prepa&s;terous</HI> fellow&mdash;You
mu&s;t know I am to have the honour to
open a ball next door to-morrow with
<PB N="57" REF="70">
lady Mac Manus; and being ru&s;ted in
my dancing, I was refre&s;hing my me|mory
with a little exerci&s;e; but if I
had known there was a &s;ick per&s;on be|low,
by Chri&s;t! I would have &s;ooner
danced a hornpipe upon my own head,
than walk the &s;ofte&s;t minuet over
yours.&endq;&mdash;My uncle, who was not a
little &s;tartled at his fir&s;t appearance, re|ceived
his compliment with great compla|cency,
in&s;i&s;ted upon his being &s;eated,
thanked him for the honour of his vi&s;it,
and reprimanded me for my abrupt ex|po&s;tulation
with a gentleman of his rank
and character. Thus tutored, I a&s;ked
pardon of the knight, who, forthwith
&s;tarting up, embraced me &s;o clo&s;e, that
I could hardly breathe; and a&s;&s;ured me,
he loved me as his own &s;oul. At length,
recollecting his night-cap, he pulled it off
in &s;ome confu&s;ion; and, with his bald|pate
uncovered, made a thou&s;and apo|logies
to the ladies, as he retired&mdash;At that
in&s;tant, the Abbey bells began to ring &s;o
loud, that we could not hear one another
&s;peak; and this peal, as we afterwards
learned, was for the honour of Mr. Bul|lock,
an eminent cow-keeper of Totten|ham,
who had ju&s;t arrived at Bath, to
drink the waters for indige&s;tion. Mr.
<PB N="58" REF="71">
Bramble had not time to make his re|marks
upon the agreeable nature of this
&s;erenade, before his ears were &s;aluted
with another concert that intere&s;ted him
more nearly. Two negroes, belonging to
a Creole gentleman, who lodged in the
&s;ame hou&s;e, taking their &s;tation at a win|dow
in the &s;tair-ca&s;e, about ten feet from
our dining-room door, began to practi&s;e
upon the French-horn; and being in the
very fir&s;t rudiments of execution, produ|ced
&s;uch di&s;cordant $ounds, as might have
di&s;compo&s;ed the organs of an a&s;s&mdash;You
may gue&s;s what effect they had upon the
irritable nerves of uncle; who, with the
mo&s;t admirable expre&s;&s;ion of &s;plenetic
&s;urprize in his countenance, &s;ent his man
to &s;ilence tho&s;e dreadful bla&s;ts, and de&s;ire
the mu&s;icians to practi&s;e in &s;ome other
place, as they had no right to &s;tand
there and di&s;turb all the lodgers in the
hou&s;e. Tho&s;e &s;able performers, far from
taking the hint, and withdrawing, treat|ed
the me&s;&s;enger with great in&s;olence;
bidding him carry his compliments to
their ma&s;ter, colonel Rigworm, who
would give him a proper an&s;wer, and a
good drubbing into the bargain; in the
mean time they continued their noi&s;e,
and even endeavoured to make it more
<PB N="59" REF="72">
di&s;agreeable; laughing between whiles,
at the thoughts of being able to torment
their betters with impunity. Our '&s;quire,
incen&s;ed at the additional in&s;ult, imme|diately
di&s;patched the &s;ervant, with his
compliments to colonel Rigworm; re|que&s;ting
that he would order his blacks
to be quiet, as the noi&s;e they made was
altogether intolerable&mdash;To this me&s;&s;age,
the Creole colonel replied, that his horns
had a right to &s;ound on a common &s;tair|ca&s;e;
that there they &s;hould play for his
diver&s;ion; and that tho&s;e who did not
like the noi&s;e, might look for lodgings
el&s;e-where. Mr. Bramble no &s;ooner re|ceived
this reply, than his eyes began to
gli&s;ten, his face grew pale, and his teeth
chattered. After a moment's pau&s;e, he
&s;lipt on his &s;hoes, without &s;peaking a
word, or &s;eeming to feel any further di|&s;turbance
from the gout in his toes. Then,
&s;natching his cane, he opened the door
and proceeded to the place where the
black trumpeters were po&s;ted. There,
without further he&s;itation, he began to
belabour them both; and exerted him&s;elf
with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing vigour and agility,
that both their heads and horns $were bro|ken
in a twinkling, and they ran howling
down &s;tairs to their ma&s;ter's parlour-door.
<PB N="60" REF="73">
The '&s;quire, following them half way,
called aloud, that the colonel might hear
him, &startq;Go, ra&s;cals, and tell your ma|&s;ter
what I have done; if he thinks
him&s;elf injured, he knows where to
come for &s;atisfaction. As for you,
this is but an earne&s;t of what you &s;hall
receive, if ever you pre&s;ume to blow a
horn again here, while I &s;tay in the
hou&s;e.&endq; So &s;aying, he retired to his
apartment, in expectation of hearing from
the We&s;t Indian; but the colonel pru|dently
declined any farther pro&s;ecution of
the di&s;pute. My &s;i&s;ter Liddy was fright|ed
into a fit, from which &s;he was no
&s;ooner recovered, than Mrs. Tabitha be|gan
a lecture upon patience; which her
brother interrupted with a mo&s;t &s;ignificant
grin, exclaiming, &startq;True, &s;i&s;ter, God in|crea&s;e
my patience and your di&s;cretion.
I wonder (added he) what &s;ort of &s;onata
we are to expect from this overture,
in which the devil, that pre&s;ides over
horrid &s;ounds, hath given us &s;uch va|riations
of di&s;cord&mdash;The trampling of
porters, the creaking and cra&s;hing of
trunks, the &s;narling of $urs, the &s;cold|ing
of women, the &s;queaking and
&s;qualling of fiddles and hautboys out
of tune, the bouncing of the Iri&s;h ba|ronet
<PB N="61" REF="74">
over-head, and the bur&s;ting,
belching, and brattling of the French|horns
in the pa&s;&s;age (not to men|tion
the harmonious peal that &s;till
thunders from the Abbey &s;teeple) &s;uc|ceeding
one another without interrup|tion,
like the different parts of the
&s;ame concert, have given me &s;uch an
idea of what a poor invalid has to ex|pect
in this temple, dedicated to Silence
and Repo&s;e, that I &s;hall certainly &s;hift
my quarters to-morrow, and endea|vour
to effectuate my retreat before
Sir Ulic opens the ball with my lady
Mac Manus; a conjunction that bodes
me no good.&endq; This intimation was by
no means agreeable to Mrs. Tabitha,
who&s;e ears were not quite &s;o delicate as
tho&s;e of her brother&mdash;She &s;aid it would
be great folly to move from &s;uch agree|able
lodgings, the moment they were
comfortably &s;ettled. She wondered he
&s;hould be &s;uch an enemy to mu&s;ick and
mirth. She heard no noi&s;e but of his
own making: it was impo&s;&s;ible to ma|nage
a family in dumb-&s;hew. He might
harp as long as he plea&s;ed upon her &s;cold|ing;
but &s;he never &s;colded, except for
his advantage; but he would never be
&s;atisfied, even tho'f &s;he &s;hould &s;weat blood
<PB N="62" REF="75">
and water in his &s;ervice&mdash;I have a great
notion that our aunt, who is now declin|ing
into the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate of celi|bacy,
had formed &s;ome de&s;ign upon the
heart of Sir Ulic Mackilligut, which &s;he
feared might be fru&s;trated by our abrupt
departure from the&s;e lodgings. Her bro|ther,
eyeing her a&s;kance, &startq;Pardon me,
&s;i&s;ter, (&s;aid he) I &s;hould be a &s;avage,
indeed&punc; were I in&s;en&s;ible of my own fe|licity,
in having &s;uch a mild, compla|cent,
good-humoured, and con&s;iderate
companion and hou&s;e-keeper; but as I
have got a weak head, and my &s;en&s;e
of hearing is painfully acute, before I
have recour&s;e to plugs of wooll and
cotton, I'll try whether I can't find
another lodging, where I &s;hall have
more quiet and le&s;s mu&s;ick.&endq; He ac|cordingly
di&s;patched his man upon this
&s;ervice; and next day he found a &s;mall
hou&s;e in Mil&s;ham-&s;treet, which he hires
by the week. Here, at lea&s;t, we enjoy
convenience and quiet within doors, as
much as Tabby's temper will allow; but
the '&s;quire &s;till complains of flying pains
in the &s;tomach and head, for which he
bathes and drinks the waters. He is not
&s;o bad, however, but that he goes in per|&s;on
to the pump, the rooms, and the
<PB N="63" REF="76">
coffee-hou&s;es; where he picks up conti|nual
food for ridicule and &s;atire. If I can
glean any thing for your amu&s;ement,
either from his ob&s;ervation or my own,
you &s;hall have it freely, though I am
afraid it will poorly compen&s;ate the trou|ble
of reading the&s;e tedious in&s;ipid let|ters

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
Bath, <DATE>April 23.</DATE>
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>IF I did not know that the exerci&s;e of
your profe&s;&s;ion has habituated you to the
hearing of complaints, I &s;hould make a
con&s;cience of troubling you with my cor|re&s;pondence,
which may be truly called
<HI>the lamentations of Matthew Bramble.</HI> Yet
I cannot help thinking, I have &s;ome right
to di&s;charge the overflowings of my
<PB N="64" REF="77">
&s;pleen upon you, who&s;e province it is to
remove tho&s;e di&s;orders that occa&s;ioned it;
and let me tell you, it is no &s;mall allevi|ation
of my grievances, that I have a &s;en|&s;ible
friend, to whom I can communicate
my cru&s;ty humours, which, by retention,
would grow intolerably acrimonious.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, I find nothing but
di&s;appointment at Bath; which is &s;o al|tered,
that I can &s;carce believe it is the
&s;ame place that I frequented about thirty
years ago. Methinks I hear you &s;ay,
&startq;Altered it is, without all doubt; but
then it is altered for the better; a truth
which, perhaps, you would own with|out
he&s;itation, if you your&s;elf was not
altered for the wor&s;e.&endq; The reflection
may, for aught I know, be ju&s;t. The
inconveniences which I overlooked in the
high-day of health, will naturally &s;trike
with exaggerated impre&s;&s;ion on the irri|table
nerves of an invalid, &s;urpri&s;ed by
premature old age, and &s;hattered with
long-&s;uffering&mdash;But, I believe, you will
not deny, that this place, which Nature
and Providence &s;eem to have intended as
a re&s;ource from di&s;temper and di&s;quiet, is
become the very center of racket and di&s;|&s;ipation.
In&s;tead of that peace, tranqui|lity
and ea&s;e, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who
<PB N="65" REF="78">
labour under bad health, weak nerves,
and irregular &s;pirits; here we have no|thing
but noi&s;e, tumult, and hurry; with
the fatigue and &s;lavery of maintaining a
ceremonial, more &s;tiff, formal, and op|pre&s;&s;ive,
than the etique$te of a German
elector. A national ho&s;pital it may be;
but one would imagine, that none but
lunatics are admitted; and, truly, I will
give you leave to call me &s;o, if I &s;tay
much longer at Bath.&mdash;But I &s;hall take
another opportunity to explain my &s;enti|ments
at greater length on this &s;ubject
&mdash;I was impatient to &s;ee the boa&s;ted im|provements
in architecture, for which the
upper parts of the town have been &s;o
much celebrated, and t'other day I made
a circuit of all the new buildings. The
Square, though irregular, is, on the whole,
pretty well laid out, &s;pacious, open, and
airy; and, in my opinion, by far the
mo&s;t whol&s;ome and agreeable &s;ituation in
Bath, e&s;pecially the upper &s;ide of it; but
the avenues to it are mean, dirty, dan|gerous,
and indirect. Its communica|tion
with the Baths, is through the yard
of an inn, where the poor trembling va|letudinarian
is carried in a chair, betwixt
the heels of a double row of hor&s;es, win|cing
under the curry-combs of grooms and
<PB N="66" REF="79">
po&s;tilions, over and above the hazard of
being ob&s;tructed, or overturned by the
carriages which are continually making
their exit or their entrance&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e af|ter
&s;ome chairmen &s;hall have been maim|ed,
and a few lives lo&s;t by tho&s;e acci|dents,
the corporation will think, in ear|ne&s;t,
about providing a more &s;afe and
commodious pa&s;&s;age. The Circus is a
pretty bauble; contrived for &s;hew, and
looks like Ve&s;pa&s;ian's amphitheatre turn|ed
out&s;ide in. If we con&s;ider it in point
of magnificence, the great number of
&s;mall doors belonging to the &s;eparate
hou&s;es, the incon&s;iderable height of the
different orders, the affected ornaments
of the architrave, which are both childi&s;h
and mi&s;placed, and the areas projecting
into the &s;treet, &s;urrounded with iron rails,
de&s;troy a good part of its effect upon the
eye; and, perhaps, we &s;hall find it &s;till
more defective, if we view it in the light
of convenience. The figure of each &s;epa|rate
dwelling hou&s;e, being the &s;egment of
a circle, mu&s;t &s;poil the &s;ymmetry of the
rooms, by contracting them towards the
&s;treet windows, and leaving a larger &s;weep
in the &s;pace behind. If, in&s;tead of the
areas and iron rails, which &s;eem to be of
very little u&s;e, there had been a corri|dore
<PB N="67" REF="80">
with arcades all round, as in Co|vent-Garden,
the appearance of the
whole would have been more magnificent
and &s;triking; tho&s;e arcades would have
afforded an agreeable covered walk, and
&s;heltered the poor chairmen and their car|riages
from the rain, which is here al|mo&s;t
perpetual. At pre&s;ent, the chairs
&s;tand &s;oaking in the open &s;treet, from
morning to night, till they become &s;o
many boxes of wet leather, for the bene|fit
of the gouty and rheumatic, who are
tran&s;ported in them from place to place.
Indeed this is a &s;hocking inconvenience
that extends over the whole city; and, I
am per&s;uaded, it produces infinite mi&s;|chief
to the delicate and infirm; even the
clo&s;e chairs, contrived for the &s;ick, by
&s;tanding in the open air, have their frize
linings impregnated, like &s;o many &s;pun|ges,
with the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere,
and tho&s;e ca&s;es of cold vapour mu&s;t give
a charming check to the per&s;piration of a
patient, piping hot from the Bath, with
all his pores wide open.</P>
<P>But, to return to the Circus: it is in|convenient
from its &s;ituation, at &s;o great
a di&s;tance from all the markets, baths,
and places of public entertainment. The
only entrance to it, through Gay-&s;treet,
<PB N="68" REF="81">
is &s;o difficult, &s;teep, and &s;lippery, that, in
wet weather, it mu&s;t be exceedingly dan|gerous,
both for tho&s;e that ride in car|riages,
and tho&s;e that walk a-foot; and
when the &s;treet is covered with &s;now, as
it was for fifteen days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively this ve|ry
winter, I don't &s;ee how any individual
could go either up or down, without the
mo&s;t imminent hazard of broken bones.
In blowing weather, I am told, mo&s;t of
the hou&s;es in this hill are &s;mothered with
&s;moke, forced down the chimneys, by
the gu&s;ts of wind reverberated from the
hill behind, which (I apprehend likewi&s;e)
mu&s;t render the atmo&s;phere here more
humid and unwhole&s;ome than it is in the
&s;quare below; for the clouds, formed by
the con&s;tant evaporation from the baths
and rivers in the bottom, will, in their
a&s;cent this way, be fir&s;t attracted and de|tained
by the hill that ri&s;es clo&s;e behind
the Circus, and load the air with a per|petual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vapours: this point,
however, may be ea&s;ily a&s;certained by
means of an hygrometer, or a paper of
&s;alt of tartar expo&s;ed to the action of the
atmo&s;phere. The &s;ame arti&s;t, who plan|ned
the Circus, has likewi&s;e projected a
Cre&s;cent; when that is fini&s;hed, we &s;hall
probably have a Star; and tho&s;e who are
<PB N="69" REF="82">
living thirty years hence, may, perhaps,
&s;ee all the &s;igns of the Zodiac exhibited in
architecture at Bath. The&s;e, however
fanta&s;tical, are &s;till de&s;igns that denote
&s;ome ingenuity and knowledge in the ar|chitect;
but the rage of building has laid
hold on &s;uch a number of adventurers,
that one &s;ees new hou&s;es &s;tarting up in
every out-let and every corner of Bath;
contrived without judgment, executed
without &s;olidity, and &s;tuck together, with
&s;o little regard to plan and propriety,
that the different lines of the new rows
and buildings interfere with, and inter|&s;ect
one another in every different angle
of conjunction. They look like the
wreck of &s;treets and &s;quares disjointed by
an earthquake, which hath broken the
ground into a variety of holes and hil|locks;
or, as if &s;ome Gothic devil had
&s;tuffed them altogether in a bag, and left
them to &s;tand higgledy piggledy, ju&s;t as
chance directed. What &s;ort of a mon|&s;ter
Bath will become in a few years, with
tho&s;e growing excre&s;cences, may be ea&s;ily
conceived: but the want of beauty and
proportion is not the wor&s;t effect of the&s;e
new man&s;ions; they are built &s;o &s;light,
with the &s;oft crumbling &s;tone found in
this neighbourhood, that I &s;hould never
<PB N="70" REF="83">
&s;leep quietly in one of them, when it
blowed (as the &s;ailors &s;ay) a cap-full of
wind; and, I am per&s;uaded, that my
hind, Roger Williams, or any man of
equal &s;trength, would be able to pu&s;h his
foot through the &s;tronge&s;t part of their
walls, without any great exertion of his
mu&s;cles. All the&s;e ab&s;urdities ari&s;e from
the general tide of luxury, which hath
over&s;pread the nation, and &s;wept away
all, even the very dregs of the people.
Every up&s;tart of fortune, harne&s;&s;ed in
the trappings of the mode, pre&s;ents him|&s;elf
at Bath, as in the very focus of ob|&s;ervation
&mdash;Clerks and factors from the
Ea&s;t Indies, loaded with the &s;poil of
plundered provinces; planters, negro|drivers,
and huck&s;ters, from our Ameri|can
plantations, enriched they know not
how; agents, commi&s;&s;aries, and contrac|tors,
who have fattened, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
wars, on the blood of the nation; u&s;ur|ers,
brokers, and jobbers of every kind;
men of low birth, and no breeding, have
found them&s;elves &s;uddenly tran&s;lated into
a &s;tate of affluence, unknown to former
ages; and no wonder that their brains
&s;hould be intoxicated with pride, vanity,
and pre&s;umption. Knowing no other cri|terion
of greatne&s;s, but the o&s;tentation of
<PB N="71" REF="84">
wealth, they di&s;charge their affluence
without ta&s;te or conduct, through every
channel of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd extravagance;
and all of them hurry to Bath, becau&s;e
here, without any further qualification,
they can mingle with the princes and no|bles
of the land. Even the wives and
daughters of low trade&s;men, who, like
&s;hovel-no&s;ed &s;harks, prey upon the blub|ber
of tho&s;e $$couth whales of fortune,
are infected with the &s;ame rage of di&s;play|ing
their importance; and the &s;lighte&s;t
indi&s;po&s;ition &s;erves them for a pretext to
in&s;i&s;t upon being conveyed to Bath,
where they may hobble country-dances
and cotillons among lordlings, '&s;quires,
coun&s;ellors, and clergy. The&s;e delicate
creatures from Bedfordbury, Butcher|row,
Crutched-Friers, and Botolph-lane,
cannot breathe in the gro&s;s air of the
Lower Town, or conform to the vulgar
rules of a common lodging-hou&s;e; the
hu&s;band, therefore, mu&s;t provide an en|tire
hou&s;e, or elegant apartments in the
new buildings. Such is the compo&s;ition
of what is called the fa&s;hionable company
at Bath; where a very incon&s;iderable pro|portion
of genteel people are lo&s;t in a
mob of impudent plebeians, who have
neither under&s;tanding nor judgment, nor
<PB N="72" REF="85">
the lea&s;t idea of propriety and decorum;
and &s;eem to enjoy nothing &s;o much as an
opportunity of in&s;ulting their betters.</P>
<P>Thus the number of people, and the
number of hou&s;es continue to increa&s;e;
and this will ever be the ca&s;e, till the
&s;treams that &s;well this irre&s;i&s;tible torrent
of folly and extravagance, &s;hall either be
exhau&s;ted, or turned into other channels,
by incidents and events which I do not
pretend to fore&s;ee. This, I own, is a
&s;ubject on which I cannot write with any
degree of patience; for the mob is a
mon&s;ter I never could abide, either in
its head, tail, midriff, or members: I
dete&s;t the whole of it, as a ma&s;s of igno|rance,
pre&s;umption, malice, and bruta|lity;
and, in this term of reprobation, I
include, without re&s;pect of rank, &s;tation,
or quality, all tho&s;e of both &s;exes, who
affect its manners, and court its &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But I have written till my fingers are
crampt, and my nau&s;ea begins to return
&mdash;By your advice, I &s;ent to London a
few days ago for half a pound of Geng|zeng;
though I doubt much, whether
that which comes from America is equal|ly
efficacious with what is brought from
the Ea&s;t Indies. Some years ago, a friend
of mine paid &s;ixteen guineas for two
<PB N="73" REF="86">
ounces of it; and, in &s;ix months after, it
was &s;old in the &s;ame &s;hop for five &s;hil|lings
the pound. In &s;hort, we live in a
vile world of fraud and &s;ophi&s;tication;
&s;o that I know nothing of equal value
with the genuine friend&s;hip of a &s;en&s;ible
man; a rare jewel! which I cannot help

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s WILLIS, at Glouce&s;ter.

MY DEAREST COMPANION,</OPENER>
<P>THE plea&s;ure I received from
yours, which came to hand ye&s;terday, is
not to be expre&s;&s;ed. Love and friend|&s;hip
are, without doubt, charming pa&s;|&s;ions;
which ab&s;ence &s;erves only to
heighten and improve. Your kind pre|&s;ent
of the garnet bracelets, I &s;hall keep
as carefully as I pre&s;erve my own life;
and I beg you will accept, in return, of my
heart-hou&s;ewife, with the tortoi&s;e-&s;hell
memorandum-book, as a trifling pledge
of my unalterable affection.</P>
<P>Bath is to me a new world&mdash;All is
gayety, good-humour, and diver&s;ion.
The eye is continually entertained with
the &s;plendour of dre&s;s and equipage; and
the ear with the &s;ound of coaches, chai&s;es,
chairs, and other carriages. <HI>The mer|ry
bells ring round,</HI> from morn till night.
Then we are welcomed by the city-waits
<PB N="76" REF="89">
in our own lodgings: we have mu&s;ick in
the Pump-room every morning, cotil|lons
every fore-noon in the rooms, balls
twice a week, and concerts every other
night, be&s;ides private a&s;&s;emblies and parties
without number&mdash;As &s;oon as we were &s;et|tled
in lodgings, we were vi&s;ited by the Ma|&s;ter
of the Ceremonies; a pretty little gen|tleman,
&s;o &s;weet, &s;o fine, &s;o civil, and polite,
that in our country he might pa&s;s for the
prince of Wales; then he talks &s;o charming|ly,
both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, that you would
be delighted to hear him di&s;cour&s;e; for
you mu&s;t know he is a great writer, and has
got five tragedies ready for the &s;tage. He
did us the favour to dine with us, by my
uncle's invitation; and next day '&s;quired
my aunt and me to every part of Bath;
which, to be &s;ure, is an earthly paradi&s;e.
The Square, the Circus, and the Pa|rades,
put you in mind of the &s;umptuous
palaces repre&s;ented in prints and pictures;
and the new buildings, &s;uch as Princes|row,
Harlequin's row, Bladud's-row, and
twenty other rows, look like &s;o many en|chanted
ca&s;tles, rai&s;ed on hanging terra|ces.</P>
<P>At eight in the morning, we go in di&s;|habille
to the Pump-room; which is
crowded like a Wel&s;h fair; and there
<PB N="77" REF="90">
you &s;ee the highe&s;t quality, and the low|e&s;t
trades folks, jo&s;tling each other, with|out
ceremony, hail-fellow well-met. The
noi&s;e of the mu&s;ick playing in the gal|lery,
the heat and flavour of &s;uch a
crowd, and the hum and buz of their
conver&s;ation, gave me the head-ach and
vertigo the fir&s;t day; but, afterwards, all
the&s;e things became familiar, and even
agreeable.&mdash;Right under the Pump-room
windows is the King's Bath; a huge
ci&s;tern, where you &s;ee the patients up to
their necks in hot water. The ladies
wear jackets and petticoats of brown li|nen,
with chip hats, in which they fix
their handkerchifs to wipe the &s;weat from
their faces; but, truly, whether it is
owing to the &s;team that &s;urrounds them,
or the heat of the water, or the nature of
the dre&s;s, or to all the&s;e cau&s;es together,
they look &s;o flu&s;hed, and &s;o frightful,
that I always turn my eyes another way&punc;&mdash;
My aunt, who &s;ays every per&s;on of fa|&s;hion
&s;hould make her appearance in the
bath, as well as in the abbey church,
contrived a cap with cherry-coloured rib|bons
to &s;uit her complexion, and obliged
Win to attend her ye&s;terday morning in
the water. But, really, her eyes were &s;o
red, that they made mine water as I
<PB N="78" REF="91">
viewed her from the Pump-room; and as
for poor Win, who wore a hat trimmed
with blue, what betwixt her wan com|plexion
and her fear, &s;he looked like the
gho&s;t of &s;ome pale maiden, who had
drowned her&s;elf for love. When &s;he
came out of the bath, &s;he took a&s;&s;afoetida
drops, and was fluttered all day; &s;o that
we could hardly keep her from going in|to
hy&s;terics: but her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ays it will
do her good; and poor Win curt&s;ies, with
the tears in her eyes. For my part, I
content my&s;elf with drinking about half
a pint of the water every morning.</P>
<P>The pumper, with his wife and &s;ervant,
attend within a bar; and the gla&s;&s;es, of
different &s;izes, &s;tand ranged in order be|fore
them, &s;o you have nothing to do but
to point at that which you chu&s;e, and it
is filled immediately, hot and &s;parkling
from the pump. It is the only hot wa|ter
I could ever drink, without being
&s;ick&mdash;Far from having that effect, it is
rather agreeable to the ta&s;te, grateful to
the &s;tomach, and reviving to the &s;pirits.
You cannot imagine what wonderful
cures it performs&mdash;My uncle began with

in drinking, and I'm afraid he will leave
it off&mdash;The fir&s;t day we came to Bath, he
<PB N="79" REF="92">
fell into a violent pa&s;&s;ion; beat two
black-a-moors, and I was afraid he would
have fought with their ma&s;ter; but the
&s;tranger proved a peaceable man. To be
&s;ure, the gout had got into his head, as
my aunt ob&s;erved: but, I believe, his
pa&s;&s;ion drove it away; for he has been re|markably
well ever &s;ince. It is a thou|&s;and
pities he &s;hould ever be troubled
with that ugly di&s;temper; for, when he
is free from pain, he is the be&s;t-tempered
man upon earth; &s;o gentle, &s;o generous,
&s;o charitable, that every body loves him;
and &s;o good to me, in particular, that I
&s;hall never be able to &s;hew the deep &s;en&s;e
I have of his tenderne&s;s and affection.</P>
<P>Hard by the Pump-room, is a coffee-hou&s;e
for the ladies; but my aunt &s;ays,
young girls are not admitted, ina&s;much
as the conver&s;ation turns upon politics,
&s;candal, philo&s;ophy, and other &s;ubjects
above our capacity; but we are allowed
to accompany them to the book&s;ellers
&s;hops, which are charming places of re|&s;ort;
where we read novels, plays,
pamphlets, and news-papers, for &s;o &s;mall
a &s;ub&s;cription as a crown a quarter; and
in the&s;e offices of intelligence, (as my
brother calls them) all the reports of the
day, and all the private tran&s;actions of
<PB N="80" REF="93">
the Bath, are fir&s;t entered and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.
From the book&s;eller's &s;hop, we make a
tour through the milliners and toy-men;
and commonly &s;top at Mr. Gill's, the
pa&s;try-cook, to take a jelly, a tart, or a
&s;mall ba&s;on of vermicelli. There is, more|over,
another place of entertainment on
the other &s;ide of the water, oppo&s;ite to
the Grove; to which the company cro&s;s
over in a boat&mdash;It is called Spring Gar|den;
a &s;weet retreat, laid out in walks
and ponds, and parterres of flowers; and
there is a long-room for breakfa&s;ting and
dancing. As the &s;ituation is low and
damp, and the &s;ea&s;on has been remark|ably
wet, my uncle won't &s;uffer me to go
thither, le&s;t I &s;hould catch cold: but my
aunt &s;ays it is all a vulgar prejudice; and,
to be &s;ure, a great many gentlemen and
ladies of Ireland frequent the place, with|out
&s;eeming to be the wor&s;e for it. They
&s;ay, dancing at Spring Gardens, when
the air is moi&s;t, is recommended to them
as an excellent cure for the rheumati&s;m.
I have been twice at the play; where,
notwith&s;tanding the excellence of the per|formers,
the gayety of the company, and
the decorations of the theatre, which are
very fine, I could not help reflecting, with
a &s;igh, upon our poor homely repre&s;en|tations
<PB N="81" REF="94">
at Glouce&s;ter&mdash;But this, in con|fidence
to my dear Willis&mdash;You know
my heart, and will excu&s;e its weak|ne&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>After all, the great &s;cenes of entertain|ment
at Bath, are the two public rooms;
where the company meet alternately
every evening&mdash;They are &s;pacious, lofty,
and, when lighted up, appear very &s;trik|ing.
They are generally crowded with
well-dre&s;&s;ed people, who drink tea in
&s;eparate parties, play at cards, walk, or
&s;it and chat together, ju&s;t as they are di&s;|po&s;ed.
Twice a-week there is a ball;
the expence of which is defrayed by a vo|luntary
&s;ub&s;cription among the gentle|men;
and every &s;ub&s;criber has three
tickets. I was there Friday la&s;t with my
aunt, under the care of my brother, who
is a &s;ub&s;criber; and Sir Ulic Mackilligut
recommended his nephew, captain O Do|naghan,
to me as a partner; but Jerry
excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by &s;aying I had got the
head-ach; and, indeed, it was really &s;o,
though I can't imagine how he knew it.
The place was &s;o hot, and the &s;mell &s;o
different from what we are u&s;ed to in the
country, that I was quite feveri&s;h when
we came away. Aunt &s;ays it is the ef|fect
of a vulgar con&s;titution, reared
<PB N="82" REF="95">
among woods and mountains; and, that
as I become accu&s;tomed to genteel com|pany,
it will wear off.&mdash;Sir Ulic was very
complai&s;ant, made her a great many
high-flown compliments; and, when we
retired, handed her with great ceremony
to her chair. The captain, I believe,
would have done me the &s;ame favour;
but my brother, &s;eeing him advance,
took me under his arm, and wi&s;hed him
good-night. The Captain is a pretty
man, to be &s;ure; tall and &s;trait, and well
made; with light-grey eyes, and a Ro|man
no&s;e; but there is a certain boldne&s;s
in his look and manner, that puts one
out of countenance&mdash;But I am afraid I
have put you out of all patience with this
long unconnected &s;crawl; which I &s;hall
therefore conclude, with a&s;&s;uring you,
that neither Bath nor London, nor all the
diver&s;ions of life, &s;hall ever be able to ef|face
the idea of my dear Letty, from the

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE done with the waters; there|fore
your advice comes a day too late&mdash;
I grant that phy&s;ick is no my&s;tery of your
making. I know it is a my&s;tery in its
own nature; and, like other my&s;teries,
requires a &s;trong gulp of faith to make
it go down&mdash;Two days ago, I went into
the King's Bath, by the advice of our
friend Ch&mdash;, in order to clear the
&s;trainer of the &s;kin, for the benefit of a
free per&s;piration; and the fir&s;t object that
&s;aluted my eye, was a child full of &s;cro|phulous
ulcers, carried in the arms of
one of the guides, under the very no&s;es
of the bathers. I was &s;o &s;hocked at the
<PB N="91" REF="104">
&s;ight, that I retired immediately with in|dignation
and di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;Suppo&s;e the mat|ter
of tho&s;e ulcers, floating on the water,
comes in contact with my &s;kin, when the
pores are all open, I would a&s;k you what
mu&s;t be the con&s;equence?&mdash;Good
Heaven, the very thought makes my
blood run cold! we know not what &s;ores
may be running into the water while we
are bathing, and what &s;ort of matter we
may thus imbibe; the king's-evil, the
&s;curvy, the cancer, and the pox; and,
no doubt, the heat will render the <HI>virus</HI>
the more volatile and penetrating. To
purify my&s;elf from all &s;uch contamina|tion,
I went to the duke of King&s;ton's
private Bath, and there I was almo&s;t &s;uf|focated
for want of free air; the place
was &s;o &s;mall, and the &s;team &s;o &s;tifling.</P>
<P>After all, if the intention is no more
than to wa&s;h the &s;kin, I am convinced
that &s;imple element is more effectual than
any water impregnated with &s;alt and
iron; which, being a&s;tringent, will cer|tainly
contract the pores, and leave a
kind of cru&s;t upon the &s;urface of the
body. But I am now as much afraid of
drinking, as of bathing; for, after a
long conver&s;ation with the Doctor, about
the con&s;truction of the pump and the
<PB N="92" REF="105">
ci&s;tern, it is very far from being clear
with me, that the patients in the Pump-room
don't &s;wallow the &s;courings of the
bathers. I can't help &s;u&s;pecting, that
there is, $r may be, &s;ome regurgitation
from the $ath into the ci&s;tern of the
pump. I$ that ca&s;e, what a delicate be|veridge
$word$ every day quaffed by the
drinkers; $edicated with the &s;weat, and
dirt, and $andriff; and the abominable
di&s;charges of various kinds, from twenty
different $$&s;ea&s;ed bodies, parboiling in
the kettle $elow. In order to avoid this
filthy compo&s;ition, I had recour&s;e to the
&s;pring that &s;upplies the private baths on
the Abbey-green; but I at once perceiv|ed
&s;omething extraordinary in the ta&s;te
and &s;mell; and, upon inquiry, I find
that the Roman baths in this quarter,
were found covered by an old burying
ground, belonging to the Abbey; thro'
which, in all probability, the water
drains in its pa&s;&s;age: &s;o that as we drink
the decoction of living bodies at the
Pump-room, we &s;wallow the &s;trainings
of rotten bones and carca&s;&s;es at the pri|vate
bath&mdash;I vow to God, the very idea
turns my &s;tomach!&mdash;Determined, as I
am, again&s;t any farther u&s;e of the Bath
waters, this con&s;ideration would give me
<PB N="93" REF="106">
little di&s;turbance, if I could find any
thing more pure, or le&s;s pernicious, to
quench my thir&s;t; but, although the
natural &s;prings of excellent water are &s;een
gu&s;hing &s;pontaneous on every &s;ide, from
the hills that &s;urround us, the inhabi|tants,
in general, make u&s;e of well-water,
&s;o impregnated with nitre, or alum, or
&s;ome other villainous mineral, that it is
equally ungrateful to the ta&s;te, and mi&s;|chievous
to the con&s;titution. It mu&s;t be
owned, indeed, that here, in Mil&s;ham|&s;treet,
we have a precarious and &s;canty
&s;upply from the hill; which is collected
in an open ba&s;on in the Circus, liable to
be defiled with dead dogs, cats, rats,
and every &s;pecies of na&s;tine&s;s, which the
ra&s;cally populace my throw into it, from
mere wantonne&s;s and brutality.&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, there is no nation that drinks &s;o
hoggi&s;hly as the Engli&s;h&mdash;What pa&s;&s;es
for wine among us, is not the juice of
the grape. It is an adulterous mixture,
brewed up of nau&s;eous ingredients, by
dunces, who are bunglers in the art of
poi&s;on-making; and yet we, and our
forefathers, are and have been poi&s;oned
by this cur$ed drench, without ta&s;te or
flavour&mdash;The only genuine and whol&s;ome
beveridge in England, is London porter,
<PB N="94" REF="107">
and Dorche&s;ter table-beer; but as for
your ale and your gin, your cyder, and
your perry, and all the tra&s;hy family of

have I to do with the human &s;pecies? ex|cept
a very few friends, I care not if the

<P>Heark ye, Lewis, my mi&s;anthrophy in|crea&s;es

grow more and more intolerable&mdash;I wi&s;h

Snares are laid for our lives in every thing

before it is occupied by any other living

infection &s;ooner, or retains it longer, than
blankets, feather-beds, and matra&s;&s;es&mdash;

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Je&s;us
college, Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I THINK tho&s;e people are unrea&s;onable,
who complain that Bath is a contracted
circle, in which the &s;ame dull &s;cenes per|petually
revolve, without variation&mdash;I
am, on the contrary, amazed to find &s;o
&s;mall a place, &s;o crowded with entertain|ment
and variety. London it&s;elf can
hardly exhibit one &s;pecies of diver&s;ion, to
which we have not &s;omething analogous
at Bath, over and above tho&s;e &s;ingular ad|vantages
that are peculiar to the place.
Here, for example, a man has daily op|portunities
of &s;eeing the mo&s;t remarkable
characters of the community. He &s;ees
them in their natural attitudes and true
colours; de&s;cended from their pede&s;tals,
and dive&s;ted of their formal draperies,
undi&s;gui&s;ed by art and affectation&mdash;Here
we have mini&s;ters of &s;tate, judges, gene|rals,
bi&s;hops, projectors, philo&s;ophers,
<PB N="98" REF="111">
wits, poets, players, <HI>chemi&s;ts, fiadlers,</HI> and
<HI>buffoons.</HI> If he makes any con&s;iderable
&s;tay in the place, he is &s;ure of meeting
with &s;ome particular friend, whom he did
not expect to &s;ee; and to me there is no|thing
more agreeable, than &s;uch ca&s;ual
rencounters&mdash;Another entertainment, pe|culiar
to Bath, ari&s;es from the general
mixture of all degrees a&s;&s;embled in our
public rooms, without di&s;tinction of rank
or fortune. This is what my uncle re|probates,
as a mon&s;trous jumble of he$e|rogeneous
principles; a vile mob of noi&s;e
and impertinence, without decency or
&s;ubordination. But this chaos is to me
a &s;ource of infinite amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>I was extremely diverted, la&s;t ball-night,
to &s;ee the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies lead|ing,
with great &s;olemnity, to the upper
end of the room, an antiquated Abigail,
dre&s;&s;ed in her lady's ca&s;t-clothes; whom
he (I &s;uppo&s;e) mi&s;took for &s;ome counte&s;s
ju&s;t arrived at the Bath. The ball was o|pened
by a Scotch lord, with a mulatto
heire&s;s from St. Chri&s;topher's; and the
gay colonel Tin&s;el danced all the even|ing
with the daughter of an eminent tin|man
from the borough of Southwark&mdash;
Ye&s;terday morning, at the Pump-room,
I &s;aw a broken-winded Wapping land|lady
<PB N="99" REF="112">
&s;queeze through a circle of peers,
to &s;alute her brandy-merchant, who &s;tood
by the window, prop'd upon crutches;
and a paralytic attorney of Shoe-lane, in
&s;huffling up to the bar, kicked the &s;hins
of the chancellor of England, while his
lord&s;hip, in a cut bob, drank a gla&s;s of
water at the pump. I cannot account
for my being plea&s;ed with the&s;e incidents,
any other way than by &s;aying, they are
truly ridiculous in their own nature, and
&s;erve to heighten the humour in the farce
of life, which I am determined to enjoy
as long as I can.&mdash;</P>
<P>Tho&s;e follies, that move my uncle's
&s;pleen, excite my laughter. He is as
tender as a man without a &s;kin; who
cannot bear the &s;lighte&s;t touch without
flinching. What tickles another would
give him torment; and yet he has what
we may call lucid intervals, when he is
remarkably facetious&mdash;Indeed, I never
knew a hypochondriac &s;o apt to be in|fected
with good-humour. He is the
mo&s;t ri&s;ible mi&s;anthrope I ever met with.
A lucky joke, or any ludicrous incident,
will &s;et him a-laughing immoderately,
even in one of his mo&s;t gloomy pa|roxy&s;ms;
and, when the laugh is over,
he will cur&s;e his own imbecillity. In
<PB N="100" REF="113">
conver&s;ing with &s;trangers, he betrays no
marks of di&s;quiet&mdash;He is &s;plenetic with
his familiars only; and not even with
them, while they keep his attention em|ployed;
but when his &s;pirits are not ex|erted
externally, they &s;eem to recoil and
prey upon him&s;elf&mdash;He has renounced
the waters with execration; but he be|gins
to find a more efficacious, and, cer|tainly,
a much more palatable remedy in
the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety. He has di&s;co|vered
&s;ome old friends, among the inva|lids
of Bath; and, in particular, renewed
his acquaintance with the celebrated
James Quin, who certainly did not
come here to drink water. You cannot
doubt, but that I had the &s;tronge&s;t curio|&s;ity
to know this original; and it was
gratified by Mr. Bramble, who has had
him twice at our hou&s;e to dinner.</P>
<P>So far as I am able to judge, Quin's
character is rather more re&s;pectable than
it has been generally repre&s;ented. His
<HI>bons mots</HI> are in every witling's mouth;
but many of them have a rank flavour,
which one would be apt to think was
derived from a natural gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of idea.
I &s;u&s;pect, however, that ju&s;tice has not
been done the author, by the collectors
of tho&s;e <HI>Quiniana;</HI> who have let the be&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="114">
of them &s;lip through their fingers, and
only retained &s;uch as were &s;uited to
the ta&s;te and organs of the multitude.
How far he may relax in his hours of jol|lity,
I cannot pretend to &s;ay; but his ge|neral
conver&s;ation is conducted by the
nice&s;t rules of propriety; and Mr. James
Quin is, certainly, one of the be&s;t bred
men in the kingdom. He is not only a
mo&s;t agreeable companion; but (as I am
credibly informed) a very hone&s;t man;
highly &s;u&s;ceptible of friend&s;hip, warm,
&s;teady, and even generous in his attach|ments;
di&s;daining flattery, and incapable
of meanne&s;s and di&s;&s;imulation. Were I to
judge, however, from Quin's eye alone,
I &s;hould take him to be proud, in&s;olent,
and cruel. There is &s;omething remark|ably
&s;evere and forbidding in his a&s;pect;
and, I have been told, he was ever di&s;|po&s;ed
to in&s;ult his inferiors and depen|dants.&mdash;Perhaps
that report has influ|enced
my opinion of his looks&mdash;You
know we are the fools of prejudice. How|&s;oever
that may be, I have as yet &s;een
nothing but his favourable &s;ide; and my
uncle, who frequently confers with him
in a corner, declares he is one of the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible men he ever knew&mdash;He &s;eems to
have a reciprocal regard for old Square|toes,
<PB N="102" REF="115">
whom he calls by the familiar name
of Matthew, and often reminds of their
old tavern-adventures: on the other hand,
Matthew's eyes &s;parkle whenever Quin
makes his appearance&mdash;Let him be never
&s;o jarring and di&s;cordant, Quin puts him
in tune; and, like treble and ba&s;s in the
&s;ame concert, they make excellent mu&s;ick
together&mdash;T'other day, the conver&s;ation
turning upon Shake&s;peare, I could not
help &s;aying, with &s;ome emotion, that I
would give an hundred guineas to &s;ee
Mr. Quin act the part of Fal&s;taff; upon
which, turning to me with a &s;mile,
&startq;And I would give a thou&s;and, young
gentleman, (&s;aid he) that I could gra|tify
your longing.&endq; My uncle and he
are perfectly agreed in their e&s;timate of
life; which, Quin &s;ays, would &s;tink in
his no&s;trils, if he did not &s;teep it in
claret.</P>
<P>I want to &s;ee this phenomenon in his
cups; and have almo&s;t prevailed upon un|cle
to give him a &s;mall turtle at the Bear.
In the mean time, I mu&s;t entertain you
with an incident, that &s;eems to confirm
the judgment of tho&s;e two cynic philo&s;o|phers.
I took the liberty to differ in
opinion from Mr. Bramble, when he ob|&s;erved,
that the mixture of people in the
<PB N="103" REF="116">
entertainments of this place was de&s;truc|tive
of all order and urbanity; that it
rendered the plebeians in&s;ufferably arro|gant
and trouble&s;ome, and vulgarized the
deportment and &s;entiments of tho&s;e who
moved in the upper &s;pheres of life. He
&s;aid, &s;uch a prepo&s;terous coalition would
bring us into contempt with all our neigh|bours;
and was wor&s;e, in fact, than de|ba&s;ing
the gold coin of the nation. I ar|gued,
on the contrary, that tho&s;e ple|beians
who di&s;covered &s;uch eagerne&s;s to
imitate the dre&s;s and equipage of their &s;u|periors,
would likewi&s;e, in time, adopt
their maxims and their manners, be po|li&s;hed
by their conver&s;ation, and refined
by their example; but when I appealed
to Mr. Quin, and a&s;ked if he did not
think that &s;uch an unre&s;erved mixture
would improve the whole ma&s;s?&mdash;&startq;Yes,
(&s;aid he) as a plate of marmalade would
improve a pan of &s;irreverence.&endq;</P>
<P>I owned I was not much conver&s;ant in
high-life, but I had &s;een what were called
polite a&s;&s;emblies in London and el&s;e|where;
that tho&s;e of Bath &s;eemed to be
as decent as any; and that, upon the
whole, the individuals that compo&s;ed it,
would not be found deficient in good
manners and decorum. &startq;But let us
<PB N="104" REF="117">
have recour&s;e to experience, (&s;aid I)&mdash;
Jack Holder, who was intended for a
par&s;on, has &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of
two thou&s;and a year, by the death of
his elder brother. He is now at the
Bath, driving about in a phaeton and
four, with French horns. He has
treated with turtle and claret at all the
taverns in Bath and Bri&s;tol, till his
gue&s;ts are gorged with good chear:
he has bought a dozen &s;uits of fine
clothes, by the advice of the Ma&s;ter
of the Ceremonies, under who&s;e tui|tion
he has entered him&s;elf: he has lo&s;t
&s;ome hundreds at billiards to &s;harpers,
and taken one of the nymphs of Avon|&s;treet
into keeping; but, finding all
the&s;e channels in&s;ufficient to drain him
of his current ca&s;h, his coun&s;ellor has
engaged him to give a general tea-|drinking
to-morrow at Wilt&s;hire's
room. In order to give it the more
eclat, every table is to be furni&s;hed
with &s;weet-meats and no&s;egays; which,
however, are not to be touched till
notice is given by the ringing of a
bell, and then the ladies may help
them&s;elves without re&s;triction. This
will be no bad way of trying the com|pany's
breeding&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="118">
&startq;I will abide by that experiment,
(cried my uncle) and if I could find
a place to &s;tand &s;ecure, without the
vortex of the tumult, which I know
will en&s;ue, I would certainly go thither
and enjoy the &s;cene.&endq; Quin propo&s;ed
that we &s;hould take our &s;tation in the
mu&s;ick-gallery; and we took his advice.
Holder had got thither before us, with
his horns perdue; but we were admitted.
The tea-drinking pa&s;&s;ed as u&s;ual; and
the company having ri&s;en from the ta|bles,
were &s;auntring in groupes, in ex|pectation
of the &s;ignal for attack, when
the bell beginning to ring, they flew with
eagerne&s;s to the de&s;ert, and the who$e
place was in&s;tantly in commotion. There
was nothing but ju&s;tling, &s;crambling,
pulling, &s;natching, &s;truggling, &s;colding,
and &s;creaming. The no&s;egays were torn
from one another's hands and bo&s;oms;
the gla&s;&s;es and china went to wreck; the
tables and floor were &s;trewed with comfits.
Some cried; &s;ome &s;wore; and the tropes
and figures of Billing&s;gate were u&s;ed
without re&s;erve in all their native ze&s;t and
flavour; nor were tho&s;e flowers of rhe|toric
unattended with &s;ignificant re&s;ticu|lation.
Some &s;napped their fingers;
&s;ome forked them out; &s;ome clapped
<PB N="106" REF="119">
their hands, and &s;ome their back-&s;ides;
at length, they fairly proceeded to pull|ing
caps, and every thing &s;eemed to pre|&s;age
a general battle; when Holder or|dered
his horns to &s;ound a charge, with a
view to animate the combatants, and in|flame
the conte&s;t; but this manoeuvre
produced an effect quite contrary to what
he expected. It was a note of reproach
that rou&s;ed them to an immediate &s;en&s;e
of their di&s;graceful &s;ituation. They were
a&s;hamed of their ab&s;urd deportment, and
&s;uddenly de&s;i&s;ted. They gathered up
their caps, ruffles, and handkerchiefs;
and great part of them retired in &s;ilent
mortification.</P>
<P>Quin laughed at this adventure; but
my uncle's delicacy was hurt. He hung
his head in manife&s;t chagrin, and &s;eemed
to repine at the triumph of his judgment
&mdash;Indeed, his victory was more complete
than he imagined; for, as we afterwards
learned, the two amazons who &s;ingulariz|ed
them&s;elves mo&s;t in the action, did not
come from the purlieus of Puddle-dock,
but from the courtly neighbourhood of
St. James's palace. One was a barone&s;s,
and the other, a wealthy knight's dowa|ger&mdash;My
uncle &s;poke not a word, till we
had made our retreat good to the coffee|hou&s;e;
<PB N="107" REF="120">
where, taking off his hat and
wiping his forehead, &startq;I ble&s;s God (&s;aid
he) that Mrs. Tabitha Bramble did not
take the field to-day!&endq; &startq;I would pit
her for a cool hundred (cried Quin)
again&s;t the be&s;t &s;hake-bag of the whole
main.&endq; The truth is, nothing could
have kept her at home but the accident
of her having taken phy&s;ick before &s;he
knew the nature of the entertainment.
She has been for &s;ome days furbi&s;hing up
an old &s;uit of black velvet, to make her
appearance as Sir Ulic's partner at the
next ball.</P>
<P>I have much to &s;ay of this amiable
kin&s;woman; but &s;he has not been proper|ly
introduced to your acquaintance. She
is remarkably civil to Mr. Quin; of
who&s;e &s;arca&s;tic humour &s;he &s;eems to &s;tand
in awe; but her caution is no match for
her impertinence. &startq;Mr. Gwynn, (&s;aid
&s;he the other day) I was once va&s;tly en|tertained
with your playing the Gho&s;t
of Gimlet at Drury-lane, when you
ro&s;e up through the &s;tage, with a white
face and red eyes, and &s;poke of <HI>quails
upon the frightful porcofine&mdash;</HI> Do, pray,
&s;pout a little the Gho&s;t of Gimlet.&endq;
&startq;Madam, (&s;aid Quin, with a glance of
ineffable di&s;dain) the Gho&s;t of Gimlet is
<PB N="108" REF="121">
laid, never to ri&s;e again&mdash;&endq; In&s;en&s;ible
of this check, &s;he proceeded: &startq;Well,
to be &s;ure, you looked and talked &s;o
like a real gho&s;t; and then the cock
crowed &s;o natural. I wonder how you
could teach him to crow &s;o exact, in
the very nick of time; but, I &s;uppo&s;e,
he's game&mdash;An't he game, Mr.
Gwynn?&endq; &startq;Dunghill, madam.&endq;
&startq;Well, dung-hill, or not dunghill, he
has got &s;uch a clear counter-tenor, that
I wi&s;h I had &s;uch another at Bramble|ton-hall,
to wake the maids of a morn|ing.
Do you know where I could
find one of his brood?&endq; &startq;Probably
in the work-hou&s;e of St. Giles's pari&s;h,
madam; but I prote&s;t I know not his
particular mew.&endq; My uncle, frying
with vexation, cried, &startq;Good God, &s;i&s;ter,
how you talk! I have told you twenty
times, that this gentleman's name is
not Gwynn.&mdash;&endq; &startq;Hoity toity, bro|ther
mine, (&s;he replied) no offence, I
hope&mdash;Gwynn is an honourable name,
of true old Briti&s;h extraction&mdash;I
thought the gentleman had been come

own pro&s;e&s;&s;ion; and if &s;o be that were
the ca&s;e, he might be of king Charles's
breed, and have royal blood in his

veins&mdash;&endq; &startq;No, madam, (an&s;wered
Quin, with great &s;olemnity) my mo|ther
was not a whore of &s;uch di&s;tinc|tion&mdash;True
it is, I am &s;ometimes
tempted to believe my&s;elf of royal

She is one of the be&s;t hearted crea|tures

have dropt &s;uch hints to the Iri&s;h baronet,
concerning her fortune, as, I make no
doubt, will cool the ardour of his ad|dre&s;&s;es.
Then her pride will take the
alarm; and the rancour of &s;tale maiden|hood
being chafed, we &s;hall hear nothing
but &s;lander and abu&s;e of Sir Ulic Mac|killigut&mdash;This
rupture, I fore&s;ee, will
facilitate our departure from Bath; where,
<PB N="111" REF="124">
at pre&s;ent, Tabby &s;eems to enjoy her&s;elf
with peculiar &s;atisfaction. For my part,
I dete&s;t it &s;o much, that I &s;hould not
have been able to &s;tay &s;o long in the place
if I had not di&s;covered &s;ome old friends;
who&s;e conver&s;ation alleviates my di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;
Going to the coffee-hou&s;e one forenoon,
I could not help contemplating the com|pany,
with equal &s;urprize and compa&s;&s;i|on&mdash;We
con&s;i&s;ted of thirteen individuals;
&s;even lamed by the gout, rheumati&s;m,
or pal&s;y; three maimed by accident; and
the re&s;t either deaf or blind. One hob|bled,
another hopped, a third dragged
his legs after him like a wounded &s;nake,
a fourth &s;traddled betwixt a pair of long
crutches, like the mummy of a felon
hanging in chains; a fifth was bent into
a horizontal po&s;ition, like a mounted te|le&s;cope,
&s;hoved in by a couple of chair|men;
and a &s;ixth was the bu&s;t of a man,
&s;et upright in a wheel machine, which
the waiter moved from place to place.</P>
<P>Being &s;truck with &s;ome of their faces,
I con&s;ulted the &s;ub&s;cription-book; and,
perceiving the names of &s;everal old
friends, began to con&s;ider the groupe
with more attention. At length I di&s;|covered
rear-admiral Balderick, the
companion of my youth, whom I had
<PB N="112" REF="125">
not &s;een &s;ince he was appointed lieute|nant
of the Severn. He was metamor|pho&s;ed
into an old man, with a wooden
leg and a weatherbeaten face; which ap|peared
the more antient from his grey
locks, that were truly venerable&mdash;Sitting
down at the table, where he was reading
a news-paper, I gazed at him for &s;ome
minutes, with a mixture of plea&s;ure and
regret, which made my heart gu&s;h with
tenderne&s;s; then, taking him by the
hand, &startq;Ah, Sam, (&s;aid I) forty years
ago I little thought&mdash;&endq; I was too much
moved to proceed. &startq;An old friend,
&s;ure enough! (cried he, &s;queezing my
hand, and &s;urveying me eagerly thro'
his gla&s;&s;es) I know the looming of the
ve&s;&s;el, though &s;he has been hard &s;train|ed
&s;ince we parted; but I can't heave
up the name&mdash;&endq; The moment I told
him who I was, he exclaimed. &startq;Ha!
Matt, my old fellow cruizer, &s;till a|float!&endq;
And, &s;tarting up, $word$ me
in his arms. His tran&s;port, $word$ $wever,
boded me no good; for, i$ &s;alu$$ng me,
he thru&s;t the &s;pring of his &s;pectacles into
my eye, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;et his
wooden &s;tump upon my gouty toe; an
attack that made me &s;hed tears in &s;ad
earne&s;t&mdash;After the hurry of our recog|nition
<PB N="113" REF="126">
was over, he pointed out two of
our common friends in the room: the
bu&s;t was what remained of colonel Cock|ril,
who had lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs in
making an American campaign; and the
tele&s;cope proved to be my college chum,
&s;ir Reginald Bently; who, with his new
title, and unexpected inheritance, com|menced
fox-hunter, without having &s;erv|ed
his apprentice&s;hip to the my&s;tery;
and, in con&s;equence of following the
hounds through a river, was &s;eized with
an inflammation in his bowels, which
has contracted him into his pre&s;ent atti|tude.</P>
<P>Our former corre&s;pondence was forth|with
renewed, with the mo&s;t hearty ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of mutual good-will; and as we
had met &s;o unexpectedly, we agreed to
dine together that very day at the tavern.
My friend Quin, being luckily unen|gaged,
obliged us with his company;
and, truly, this was the mo&s;t happy day
I have pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e twenty years. You
and I, Lewis, having been always toge|ther,
never ta&s;ted friend&s;hip in this high
go&ucirc;t, contracted from long ab&s;ence. I
cannot expre&s;s the half of what I felt at
this ca&s;ual meeting of three or four com|panions,
who had been &s;o long &s;eparated,
<PB N="114" REF="127">
and &s;o roughly treated by the &s;torms of
life. It was a renovation of youth; a
kind of re&s;u&s;citation of the dead, that re|alized
tho&s;e intere&s;ting dreams, in which
we &s;ometimes retrieve our antient friends
from the grave. Perhaps my enjoyment
was not the le&s;s plea&s;ing for being mix|ed
with a &s;train of melancholy, produced
by the remembrance of pa&s;t &s;cenes, that
conjured up the ideas of &s;ome endearing
connexions, which the hand of Death has
actually di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The &s;pirits and good-humour of the
company &s;eemed to triumph over the
wreck of their co&s;titutions. They had
even philo&s;ophy enough to joke upon
their own calamities; &s;uch is the power
of friend&s;hip, the &s;overeign cordial of life
&mdash;I afterwards found, however, that they
were not without their moments, and
even hours of di&s;quiet. Each of them a|part,
in &s;ucceeding conferences, expati|ated
upon his own particular grievances;
and they were all malcontents at bottom
&mdash;Over and above their per&s;onal di&s;a&s;ters,
they thought them&s;elves unfortunate in
the lottery of life. Baldrick complained,
that all the recompence he had received
for his long and hard &s;ervice, was the
half-pay of a rear-admiral. The colo|nel
<PB N="115" REF="128">
was mortified to &s;ee him&s;elf over-top|ped
by up&s;tart generals, &s;ome of whom
he had once commanded; and, being a
man of a liberal turn, could ill put up
with a moderate annuity, for which he
had &s;old his commi&s;&s;ion. As for the ba|ronet,
having run him&s;elf con&s;iderably in
debt, on a conte&s;ted election, he has been
obliged to relinqui&s;h his &s;eat in parlia|ment,
and his &s;eat in the country at the
&s;ame time, and put his e&s;tate to nur&s;e;
but his chagrin, which is the effect of his
own mi&s;conduct, does not affect me half
&s;o much as that of the other two; who
have acted honourable and di&s;tingui&s;hed
parts on the great theatre, and are now
reduced to lead a weary life in this &s;tew|pan
of idlene&s;s and in&s;ignificance. They
have long left off u&s;ing the waters, after
having experienced their inefficacy. The
diver&s;ions of the place they are not in a
condition to enjoy. How then do they
make &s;hift to pa&s;s their time? In the
forenoon, they crawl out to the Rooms
or the coffee-hou&s;e, where they take a
hand at whi&s;t, or de&s;cant upon the Gene|ral
Adverti&s;er; and their evenings they
murder in private parties, among peevi&s;h
invalids, and in&s;ipid old women&mdash;This
is the ca&s;e with a good number of indi|viduals,
<PB N="116" REF="129">
whom nature &s;eems to have in|tended
for better purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>About a dozen years ago, many decent
families, re&s;tricted to &s;mall fortunes, be|&s;ides
tho&s;e that came hither on the &s;core
of health, were tempted to &s;ettle at Bath,
where they could then live comfortably,
and even make a genteel appearance, at a
&s;mall expence: but the madne&s;s of the
times has made the place too hot for
them, and they are now obliged to think
of other migrations&mdash;Some have already
fled to the mountains of Wales, and
others have retired to Exeter. Thither,
no doubt, they will be followed by the
flood of luxury and extravagance, which
will drive them from place to place to the
very Land's End; and there, I &s;uppo&s;e,
they will be obliged to &s;hip them&s;elves
to &s;ome other country. Bath is become
a mere &s;ink of profligacy and extortion.
Every article of hou&s;e-keeping is rai&s;ed to
an enormous price; a circum&s;tance no
longer to be wondered at, when we know
that every petty retainer of fortune
piques him&s;elf upon keeping a table, and
thinks 'tis for the honour of his character
to wink at the knavery of his &s;ervants,
who are in a confederacy with the market-people;
and, of con&s;equence, pay what|ever
<PB N="117" REF="130">
they demand. Here is now a mu&s;h|room
of opulence, who pays a cook
&s;eventy guineas a week for furni&s;hing him
with one meal a day. This portentous
frenzy is become &s;o contagious, that the
very rabble and refu&s;e of mankind are
infected. I have known a negro-driver,
from Jamacia, pay over-night to the ma|&s;ter
of one of the rooms, &s;ixty-five
guineas for tea and coffee to the com|pany,
and leave Bath next morning, in
&s;uch ob&s;curity, that not one of his gue&s;ts
had the &s;lighte&s;t idea of his per&s;on, or
even made the lea&s;t inquiry about his
name. Incidents of this kind are fre|quent;
and every day teems with fre&s;h
ab&s;urdities, which are too gro&s;s to make
a thinking man merry.&mdash;But I feel the
&s;pleen creeping on me apace; and there|fore
will indulge you with a ce&s;&s;ation,
that you may have no unnece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e
to cur&s;e your corre&s;pondence with,</P>

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s LAETITIA WILLIS, at Glouce&s;ter.
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you at great length by the
po&s;t, the twenty-&s;ixth of la&s;t month, to
which I refer you for an account of our
proceedings at Bath; and I expect your
an&s;wer with impatience. But, having
this opportunity of a private hand, I &s;end
you two dozen of Bath rings; &s;ix of the
be&s;t of which I de&s;ire you will keep for
your&s;elf, and di&s;tribute the re&s;t among
the young ladies, our common friends, as
you &s;hall think proper&mdash;I don't know
how you will approve of the mottoes;
&s;ome of them are not much to my own
liking; but I was obliged to take &s;uch
as I could find ready manufactured&mdash;I
am vexed, that neither you nor I have re|ceived
any further information of a cer|tain
per&s;on&mdash;Sure it can't be wilful neg|lect!&mdash;O
my dear Willis! I begin to be
vi&s;ited by &s;trange fancies, and to have
&s;ome melancholy doubts; which, how|ever,
<PB N="119" REF="132">
it would be ungenerous to harbour
without further inquiry&mdash;My uncle, who
has made me a pre&s;ent of a very fine &s;et
of garnets, talks of treating us with a
jaunt to London; which, you may ima|gine,
will be highly agreeable: but I
like Bath &s;o well, that I hope he won't
think of leaving it till the &s;ea&s;on is quite
over; and yet, betwixt friends, &s;ome|thing
has happened to my aunt, which
will probably &s;horten our &s;tay in this
place.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, in the forenoon, &s;he went
by her&s;elf to a breakfa&s;ting in one of the
rooms; and, in half an hour, returned in
great agitation, having Chowder along
with her in the chair. I believe &s;ome ac|cident
mu&s;t have happened to that un|lucky
animal, which is the great &s;ource
of all her troubles. Dear Letty! what a
pity it is, that a woman of her years and
di&s;cretion, &s;hould place her affection up|on
&s;uch an ugly, ill-conditioned cur, that
&s;narls and &s;naps at every body. I a&s;ked
John Thomas, the foot-man who attend|ed
her, what was the matter? and he did
nothing but grin. A famous dog-doctor
was &s;ent for, and undertook to cure the
patient, provided he might carry him
home to his own hou&s;e; but his mi&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="120" REF="133">
would not part with him out of her own
&s;ight&mdash;She ordered the cook to warm
cloths, which &s;he applied to his bowels,
with her own hand. She gave up all
thoughts of going to the ball in the even|ing;
and when Sir Ulic came to drink
tea, refu&s;ed to be &s;een; &s;o that he went
away to look for another partner. My
brother Jery whi&s;tles and dances. My
uncle &s;ometimes &s;hrugs up his &s;houlders,
and &s;ometimes bur&s;ts out a-laughing. My
aunt &s;obs and &s;colds by turns; and her
woman, Win Jinkins, &s;tares and wonders
with a fooli&s;h face of curio&s;ity; and, for
my part, I am as curious as &s;he, but
a&s;hamed to a&s;k que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Perhaps time will di&s;cover the my&s;te|ry;
for if it was any thing that happened
in the Rooms, it can't be long concealed
&mdash;All I know is, that la&s;t night at &s;upper,
mi&s;s Bramble &s;poke very di&s;dainfully of
Sir Ulic Mackilligut, and a&s;ked her bro|ther
if he intended to keep us &s;weltering
all the &s;ummer at Bath? &startq;No, &s;i&s;ter
Tabitha, (&s;aid he, with an arch &s;mile)
we &s;hall retreat before the Dog-days
begin; though I make no doubt, that
with a little temperance and di&s;cretion,
our con&s;titutions might be kept cool
enough all the year, even at Bath.&endq;
<PB N="121" REF="134">
As I don't know the meaning of this in|&s;inuation,
I won't pretend to make any
remarks upon it at pre&s;ent: hereafter,
perhaps, I may be able to explain it more
to your &s;atisfaction&mdash;In the mean time,

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.</OPENER>
<P>SO then Mrs. Blackerby's affair has
proved a fal&s;e alarm, and I have &s;aved
my money? I wi&s;h, however, her decla|ration
had not been &s;o premature; for
though my being thought capable of
making her a mother, might have given
me &s;ome credit, the reputation of an in|trigue
with &s;uch a cracked pitcher does
me no honour at all&mdash;In my la&s;t I told
you I had hopes of &s;eeing Quin, in his
hours of elevation at the tavern which
<PB N="122" REF="135">
is the temple of mirth and good-fellow|&s;hip;
where he, as prie&s;t of Comus, ut|ters
the in&s;pirations of wit and humour
&mdash;I have had that &s;atisfaction. I have
dined with his club at the Three Tuns,
and had the honour to &s;it him out. At
half an hour pa&s;t eight in the evening, he
was carried home with &s;ix good bottles of
claret under his belt; and it being then
Friday, he gave orders, that he &s;hould
not be di&s;turbed till Sunday at noon&mdash;
You mu&s;t not imagine that this do&s;e had
any other effect upon his conver&s;ation,
but that of making it more extravagant|ly
entertaining&mdash;He had lo&s;t the u&s;e of
his limbs, indeed, &s;everal hours before
we parted, but he retained all his other
faculties in perfection; and as he gave
vent to every whim&s;ical idea as it ro&s;e,
I was really a&s;toni&s;hed at the brilliancy of
his thoughts, and the force of his expre&s;|&s;ion.
Quin is a real voluptuary in the
articles of eating and drinking; and &s;o
confirmed an epicure, in the common
acceptation of the term, that he cannot
put up with ordinary fare. This is a
point of &s;uch importance with him, that
he always takes upon him&s;elf the charge
of catering; and a man admitted to his
me&s;s, is always &s;ure of eating delicate
<PB N="123" REF="136">
victuals, and drinking excellent wine&mdash;
He owns him&s;elf addicted to the delights
of the &s;tomach, and often jokes upon
his own &s;en&s;uality; but there is nothing
&s;elfi&s;h in this appetite&mdash;He finds that
good chear unites good company; exhi|lerates
the &s;pirits, opens the heart, ba|ni&s;hes
all re&s;traint from conver&s;ation, and
promotes the happie&s;t purpo&s;es of &s;ocial
life.&mdash;But Mr. James Quin is not a &s;ub|ject
to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the compa&s;s of one
letter; I &s;hall therefore, at pre&s;ent, leave
him to his repo&s;e, and call another of a
very different complexion.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire to have further acquain|tance
with the per&s;on of our aunt, and
promi&s;e your&s;elf much entertainment
from her connexion with Sir Ulic Mackil|ligut:
but in this hope you are baulked
already; that connexion is di&s;&s;olved.
The Iri&s;h baronet is an old hound, that,
finding her carrion, has quitted the &s;cent&mdash;
I have already told you, that Mrs. Tabi|tha
Bramble is a maiden of &s;orty-five. In
her per&s;on, &s;he is tall, raw-boned, auk|wark,
flat-che&s;ted, and &s;tooping; her
complexion is &s;allow and freckled; her
eyes are not grey, but greeni&s;h, like tho&s;e
of a cat, and generally inflamed; her
hair is of a &s;andy, or rather du&s;ty hue;
<PB N="124" REF="137">
her forehead low; her no&s;e long, &s;harp,
and, towards the extremity, always red
in cool weather; her lips &s;kinny, her
mouth exten&s;ive, her teeth &s;traggling and
loo&s;e, of various colours and conforma|tion;
and her long neck &s;hrivelled into
a thou&s;and wrinkles&mdash;In her temper, &s;he
is proud, &s;tiff, vain, imperious, prying,
malicious, greedy, and uncharitable. In
all likelihood, her natural au&s;terity has
been &s;oured by di&s;appointment in love;
for her long celibacy is by no means ow|ing
to her di&s;like of matrimony: on the
contrary, &s;he has left no &s;tone unturned
to avoid the reproachful epithet of old
maid.</P>
<P>Before I was born, &s;he had gone &s;uch
lengths in the way of flirting with a re|cruiting
officer, that her reputation was
a little &s;inged. She afterwards made ad|vances
to the curate of the pari&s;h, who
dropped &s;ome di&s;tant hints about the next
pre&s;entation to the living, which was in
her brother's gi$t; but finding that was
already promi&s;ed to another, he flew off
at a tangent; and Mrs. Tabby, in re|venge,
found means to deprive him of
his cure. Her next lover was lieutenant
of a man of war, a relation of the fami|ly,
who did not under&s;tand the refine|ments
<PB N="125" REF="138">
of the pa&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;&s;ed no
aver&s;ion to grapple with cou&s;in Tabby in
the way of marriage; but before matters
could be properly adju&s;ted, he went out
on a crui&s;e, and was killed in an engage|ment
with a French frigate. Our aunt,
though baffled &s;o often, did not yet de&s;|pair&mdash;She
layed all her &s;nares for Dr.
Lewis, who is the <HI>fidus Achates</HI> of my un|cle.
She even fell &s;ick upon the occa|&s;ion,
and prevailed with Matt to inter|po&s;e
in her behalf with his friend; but
the Doctor, being a &s;hy cock, would not
be caught with chaff, and flatly rejected
the propo&s;al: &s;o that Mrs. Tabitha was
content to exert her patience once more,
after having endeavoured in vain to effect
a rupture betwixt the two friends; and
now &s;he thinks proper to be very civil to
Lewis, who is become nece&s;&s;ary to her in
the way of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, are not the only ef|forts
&s;he has made towards a nearer con|junction
with our &s;ex. Her fortune was
originally no more than a thou&s;and
pounds; but &s;he gained an acce&s;&s;ion
of five hundred by the death of a
&s;i&s;ter, and the lieutenant left her three
hundred in his will. The&s;e &s;ums &s;he has
more than doubled, by living free of all
<PB N="126" REF="139">
expence, in her brother's hou&s;e; and deal|ing
in chee&s;e and Wel&s;h flannel, the pro|duce
of his flocks and dairy. At pre&s;ent
her capital is increa&s;ed to about four
thou&s;and pounds; and her avarice &s;eems
to grow every day more and more rapa|cious:
but even this is not &s;o intolerable,
as the perver&s;ene&s;s of her nature, which
keeps the whole family in di&s;quiet and
uproar. She is one of tho&s;e geniu&s;es
who find &s;ome diabolical enjoyment in
being dreaded and dete&s;ted by their fel|low-creatures.</P>
<P>I once told my uncle, I was &s;urpri&s;ed
that a man of his di&s;po&s;ition could bear
&s;uch a dome&s;tic plague, when it could be
&s;o ea&s;ily removed&mdash;The remark made
him &s;ore, becau&s;e it &s;eemed to tax him
with want of re&s;olution&mdash;Wrinkling up
his no&s;e, and drawing down his eye|brows,
&startq;A young fellow, (&s;aid he) when
he fir&s;t thru&s;ts his &s;nout into the world,
is apt to be &s;urpri&s;ed at many things,
which a man of experience knows to be
ordinary and unavoidable&mdash;This pre|cious
aunt of yours is become in&s;en|&s;ibly
a part of my con&s;titution&mdash;Damn
her! She's a <HI>noli me tangere</HI> in my fle&s;h,
which I cannot bear to be touched or
tampered with.&endq; I made no reply;
<PB N="127" REF="140">
but &s;hifted the conver&s;ation. He real|ly
has an affection for this original; which
maintains its ground in defiance of com|mon
&s;en&s;e, and in de&s;pite of that con|tempt
which he mu&s;t certainly feel for her
character and under&s;tanding. Nay, I
am convinced, that &s;he has likewi&s;e a
mo&s;t virulent attachment to his per&s;on;
though her love never &s;hews it&s;elf but in
the &s;hape of di&s;content; and &s;he per&s;i&s;ts in
tormenting him, out of &s;heer tenderne&s;s&mdash;
The only object within doors upon which
&s;he be&s;tows any marks of affection, in the
u&s;ual &s;tile, is her dog Chowder; a filthy
cur from Newfoundland, which &s;he had
in a pre&s;ent from the wife of a &s;kipper
in Swan&s;ey&mdash;One would imagine &s;he had
di&s;tingui&s;hed this bea&s;t with her favour
on account of his ugline&s;s and ill-nature;
if it was not, indeed, an in&s;tinctive &s;ym|pathy
between his di&s;po&s;ition and her
own. Certain it is, &s;he care&s;&s;es him with|out
cea&s;ing; and even harra&s;&s;es the fa|mily
in the &s;ervice of this cur&s;ed animal,
which, indeed, has proved the proximate
cau&s;e of her breach with Sir Ulic Mackil|ligut.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, &s;he ye&s;terday wanted to
&s;teal a march of poor Liddy, and went to
breakfa&s;t in the Room without any other
<PB N="128" REF="141">
companion than her dog, in expectation
of meeting with the Baronet, who had
agreed to dance with her in the evening&mdash;
Chowder no &s;ooner made his appearance
in the Room, than the Ma&s;ter of the Ce|remonies,
incen&s;ed at his pre&s;umption,
ran up to drive him away, and threatened
him with his foot; but the other &s;eemed
to de&s;pi&s;e his authority, and di&s;playing
a formidable ca&s;e of long, white, &s;harp
teeth, kept the puny monarch at bay&mdash;
While he &s;tood under &s;ome trepidation,
fronting his antagoni&s;t, and bawling to
the waiter, Sir Ulic Macklilligut came to
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;eeming ignorant of
the connexion between this intruder and
his mi&s;tre&s;s, gave the former &s;uch a kick
in the jaws, as &s;ent him howling to the
door&mdash;Mrs. Tabitha, incen&s;ed at this
outrage, ran after him, &s;qualling in a
tone equally di&s;agreeable; while the Ba|ronet
followed her on one &s;ide, making
apologies for his mi&s;take; and Derrick
on the other, making remon&s;trances
upon the rules and regulations of the
place.</P>
<P>Far from being &s;atisfied with the
Knight's excu&s;es, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure he
was no gentleman; and when the Ma&s;ter
of the Ceremonies offered to hand her in|to
<PB N="129" REF="142">
the chair, &s;he rapped him over the
knuckles with her fan. My uncle's foot|man
being &s;till at the door, &s;he and
Chowder got into the &s;ame vehicle, and
were carried off amid&s;t the jokes of the
chairmen and other populace&mdash;I had
been riding out on Clerkendown, and
happened to enter ju&s;t as the <HI>fracas</HI> was
over&mdash;The Baronet, coming up to me
with an affected air of chagrin, recounted
the adventure; at which I laughed
heartily, and then his countenance clear|ed
up. &startq;My dear &s;oul, (&s;aid he) when
I &s;aw a &s;ort of a wild bai&s;t, &s;nar|ling
with open mouth at the Ma&s;ter
of the Ceremonies, like the red cow go|ing
to devour Tom Thumb, I could
do no le&s;s than go to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the little man; but I never dreamt the
bai&s;t was one of Mrs. Bramble's atten|dants&mdash;O!
if I had, he might have
made his breakfa&s;t upon Derrick and
wellcome&mdash;But, you know, my dear
friend, how natural it is for us Iri&s;h|men
to blunder, and to take the wrong
&s;ow by the ear&mdash;However, I will con|fe&s;s
judgment, and cry her mercy;
and, 'tis to be hoped, a penitent &s;inner
may be forgiven.&endq; I told him, that
as the offence was not involuntary of his
<PB N="130" REF="143">
&s;ide, it was to be hoped he would not
find her implacable.</P>
<P>But, in truth, all this concern was di&s;|&s;embled.
In his approaches of gallantry
to Mrs. Tabitha, he had been mi&s;led by a
mi&s;take of at lea&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and pounds,
in the calculation of her fortune; and in
this particular he was ju&s;t undeceived.
He, therefore, &s;eized the fir&s;t opportuni|ty
of incurring her di&s;plea&s;ure decently,
in &s;uch a manner as would certainly anni|hilate
the corre&s;pondence; and he could
not have taken a more effectual method,
than that of beating her dog. When he
pre&s;ented him&s;elf at our door, to pay his
re&s;pects to the offended fair, he was re|fu&s;ed
admittance; and given to under|&s;tand,
that he &s;hould never find her at
home for the future. She was not &s;o in|acce&s;&s;ible
to Derrick, who came to de|mand
&s;atisfaction for the in&s;ult &s;he had
offered to him, even in the verge of his
own court. She knew it was convenient
to be well with the Ma&s;ter of the Cere|monies,
while &s;he continued to frequent
the Rooms; and, having heard he was a
poet, began to be afraid of making her
appearance in a ballad or lampoon.&mdash;She
therefore made excu&s;es for what &s;he had
done, imputing it to the flutter of her
<PB N="131" REF="144">
&s;pirits; and &s;ub&s;cribed hand&s;omely for
his poems: &s;o that he was perfectly ap|pea&s;ed,
and overwhelmed her with a pro|fu&s;ion
of compliment. He even &s;olicited
a reconciliation with Chowder; which,
however, the latter declined; and he de|clared,
that if he could find a precedent
in the annals of the Bath, which he
would carefully examine for that purpo&s;e,
her favourite &s;hould be admitted to the
next public breakfa&s;ting&mdash;But, I believe,
&s;he will not expo&s;e her&s;elf or him to the
ri&s;que of a &s;econd di&s;grace&mdash;Who will
&s;upply the place of Mackilligut in her af|fections,
I cannot fore&s;ee; but nothing
in the &s;hape of man can come ami&s;s.
Though &s;he is a violent church-woman,
of the mo&s;t intolerant zeal, I believe in
my con&s;cience &s;he would have no ob|jection,
at pre&s;ent, to treat on the &s;core
of matrimony with an Anapabti&s;t, Qua|ker,
or Jew; and even ratify the treaty,
at the expence of her own conver&s;ion.

<P>YOU a&s;k me, why I don't take the
air a-hor&s;eback, during this fine weather?
&mdash;In which of the avenues of this para|di&s;e
would you have me take that exer|ci&s;e?
Shall I commit my&s;elf to the high|roads
of London or Bri&s;tol, to be &s;tifled
with du&s;t, or pre&s;&s;ed to death in the mid&s;t
of po&s;t-chai&s;es, flying-machines, waggons,
and coal-hor&s;es; be&s;ides the troops of
fine gentlemen that take to the high-way,
to &s;hew their hor&s;eman&s;hip; and the
coaches of fine ladies, who go thither to
&s;hew their equipages? Shall I attempt the
Downs, and fatigue my&s;elf to death in
climbing up an eternal a&s;cent, without any
hopes of reaching the &s;ummit? Know
then, I have made divers de&s;perate leaps
at tho&s;e upper regions; but always fell
backward into this vapour-pit, exhau&s;ted
and di&s;pirited by tho&s;e ineffectual efforts;
and here we poor valetudinarians pant and
&s;truggle, like &s;o many Chine&s;e gudgeons,
<PB N="133" REF="146">
ga&s;ping in the bottom of a punch-bowl.
By Heaven, it is a kind of inchantment!
If I do not &s;peedily break the &s;pell, and
e&s;cape, I may chance to give up the gho&s;t
in this nau&s;eous &s;tew of corruption&mdash;It
was but two nights ago, that I had like
to have made my public exit, at a minute's
warning. One of my greate&s;t weakne&s;&s;es
is that of &s;uffering my&s;elf to be over-ruled
by the opinion of people, who&s;e judg|ment
I de&s;pi&s;e&mdash;I own, with &s;hame and
confu&s;ion of face, that importunity of
any kind I cannot re&s;i&s;t. This want of
courage and con&s;tancy is an original flaw
in my nature, which you mu&s;t have of|ten
ob&s;erved with compa&s;&s;ion, if not with
contempt. I am afraid &s;ome of our
boa&s;ted virtues may be traced up to this
defect.&mdash;</P>
<P>Without further preamble, I was per|&s;uaded
to go to a ball, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee
Liddy dance a minuet with a young pe|tulant
jackanapes, the only &s;on of a
wealthy undertaker from London, who&s;e
mother lodges in our neighbourhood, and
has contracted an acquaintance with Tab|by.
I &s;at a couple of long hours, half
&s;tifled, in the mid&s;t of a noi&s;ome crowd;
and could not help wondering, that &s;o
many hundreds of tho&s;e that rank as ra|tional
<PB N="134" REF="147">
creatures, could find entertain|ment
in &s;eeing a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of in&s;ipid ani|mals,
de&s;cribing the &s;ame dull figure for
a whole evening, on an area, not much
bigger than a taylor's &s;hop-board. If
there had been any beauty, grace, acti|vity,
magnificent dre&s;s, or variety of any
kind, how&s;oever ab&s;urd, to engage the
attention, and amu&s;e the fancy, I &s;hould
not have been &s;urpri&s;ed; but there was
no &s;uch object: it was a tire&s;ome repeti|tion
of the &s;ame languid, frivolous &s;cene,
performed by actors that &s;eemed to &s;leep
in all their motions&mdash;The continual
&s;wimming of tho&s;e phantoms before
my eyes, gave me a &s;wimming of the
head; which was al&s;o affected by the
fouled air, circulating through &s;uch a
number of rotten human bellows&mdash;I
therefore retreated towards the door, and
&s;tood in the pa&s;&s;age to the next room,
talking to my friend Quin; when an end
being put to the minuets, the benches
were removed to make way for the coun|try-dances;
and the multitude ri&s;ing at
once, the whole atmo&s;phere was put in
commotion. Then, all of a &s;udden,
came ru&s;hing upon me an Egyptian gale,
&s;o impregnated with pe&s;tilential vapours,

that my nerves were overpowered, and I

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>A FEW days ago we were terribly
alarmed by my uncle's fainting at the
ball&mdash;He has been ever &s;ince cur&s;ing his
own folly, for going thither at the reque&s;t
of an impertinent woman. He declares,
he will &s;ooner vi&s;it a hou&s;e infected with
the plague, than tru&s;t him&s;elf in &s;uch a
nau&s;eous &s;pital for the future, for he
&s;wears the accident was occa&s;ioned by the
&s;tench of the crowd; and that he would
<PB N="138" REF="151">
never de&s;ire a &s;tronger proof of our being
made of very gro&s;s materials, than our
having with&s;tood the annoyance, by
which he was &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed. For
my part, I am very thankful for the
coar&s;ene&s;s of my organs, being in no dan|ger
of ever falling a &s;acrifice to the deli|cacy
of my no&s;e. Mr. Bramble is ex|travagantly
delicate in all his &s;en&s;ations,
both of &s;oul and body. I was informed
by Dr. Lewis, that he once fought a duel
with an officer of the hor&s;e-guards, for
turning a-&s;ide to the Park wall, on a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
occa&s;ion, when he was pa&s;&s;ing with
a lady under his protection. His blood
ri&s;es at every in&s;tance of in&s;olence and
cruelty, even where he him&s;elf is no way
concerned; and ingratitude makes his
teeth chatter. On the other hand, the
recital of a generous, humane, or grate|ful
action, never fails to draw from him
tears of approbation, which he is often
greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to conceal.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, one Paunceford gave tea,
on particular invitation&mdash;This man, after
having been long buffetted by adver&s;ity,
went abroad; and Fortune, re&s;olved to
make him amends for her former coy|ne&s;s,
&s;et him all at once up to the very
ears in affluence. He has now emerged
<PB N="139" REF="152">
from ob&s;curity, and blazes out in all the
tin&s;el of the times. I don't find that he
is charged with any practices that the law
deems di&s;hone&s;t, or that his wealth has
made him arrogant and inacce&s;&s;ible; on
the contrary, he takes great pains to ap|pear
affable and gracious. But they &s;ay,
he is remarkable for &s;hrinking from his
former friend&s;hips, which were generally
too plain and home-&s;pun to appear amid&s;t
his pre&s;ent brilliant connexions; and that
he &s;eems unea&s;y at &s;ight of &s;ome old be|nefactors,
whom a man of honour would
take plea&s;ure to acknowledge&mdash;Be that
as it may, he had &s;o effectually engaged
the company at Bath, that when I went
with my uncle to the coffee-hou&s;e in the
evening, there was not a &s;oul in the room
but one per&s;on, &s;eemingly in years, who
&s;at by the fire, reading one of the papers.
Mr. Bramble, taking his &s;tation clo&s;e by
him, &startq;There is &s;uch a crowd and con|fu&s;ion
of chairs in the pa&s;&s;age to Simp|&s;on's,
(&s;aid he) that we could hardly
get along&mdash;I wi&s;h tho&s;e minions of
fortune would fall upon more laudable
ways of &s;pending their money.&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e,
&s;ir, you like this kind of enter|tainment
as little as I do?&endq; &startq;I can't
&s;ay, I have any great reli&s;h for &s;uch en|tertainments,&endq;
<PB N="140" REF="153">
an&s;wered the other,
without taking his eyes off the paper&mdash;
&startq;Mr. Serle, (re&s;umed my uncle) I beg
pardon for interrupting you; but I
can't re&s;i&s;t the curio&s;ity I have to know
if you received a card on this occa|&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>The man &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at this ad|dre&s;s,
and made &s;ome pau&s;e, as doubt|ful
what an&s;wer he &s;hould make. &startq;I
know my curio&s;ity is impertinent, (ad|ded
my uncle) but I have a particular
rea&s;on for a&s;king the favour.&endq; &startq;If that
be the ca&s;e, (replied Mr. Serle) I &s;hall
gratify you without he&s;itation, by own|ing,
that I have had no card. But,
give me leave, &s;ir, to a&s;k in my turn,
what rea&s;on you think I have to expect
&s;uch an invitation from the gentleman
who gives tea?&endq; &startq;I have my own
rea&s;ons; (cried Mr. Bamble, with &s;ome
emotion) and am convinced, more than
ever, that this Paunceford is a con|temptible
fellow.&endq; &startq;Sir, (&s;aid the
other, laying down the paper) I have
not the honour to know you; but your
di&s;cour&s;e is a little my&s;terious, and
&s;eems to require &s;ome explanation.
The per&s;on you are plea&s;ed to treat &s;o
cavalierly, is a gentleman of &s;ome con|&s;equence
<PB N="141" REF="154">
in the community; and, for
aught you know, I may al&s;o have my
particular rea&s;ons for defending his
character&mdash;&endq; &startq;If I was not convin|ced
of the contrary, (ob&s;erved the
other) I &s;hould not have gone &s;o far&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Let me tell you, &s;ir, (&s;aid the &s;tran|ger,
rai&s;ing his voice) you have gone
too far, in hazarding &s;uch reflec|tions&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by my uncle;
who a&s;ked peevi&s;hly, if he was Don
Quixote enough, at this time of day, to
throw down his gauntlet as champion
for a man who had treated him with &s;uch
ungrateful neglect. &startq;For my part, (ad|ded
he) I &s;hall never quarrel with you
again upon this &s;ubject; and what I
have &s;aid now, has been &s;ugge&s;ted as
much by my regard for you, as by my
contempt of him&mdash;&endq; Mr. Serle, then
pulling off his &s;pectacles, eyed uncle very
earne&s;tly, &s;aying, in a mitigated tone,
&startq;Surely I am much obliged&mdash;Ah,
Mr. Bramble! I now recollect your
features, though I have not &s;een you
the&s;e many years.&endq; &startq;We might have
been le&s;s &s;trangers to one another, (an|&s;wered
the '&s;quire) if our corre&s;pon|dence
had not been interrupted, in
<PB N="142" REF="155">
con&s;equence of a mi&s;under&s;tanding,
occa&s;ioned by this very&mdash;, but no
matter&mdash;Mr. Serle, I e&s;teem your cha|racter;
and my friend&s;hip, &s;uch as it
is, you may freely command.&endq; &startq;The
offer is too agreeable to be declined;
(&s;aid he) I embrace it very cordially;
and, as the fir&s;t fruits of it, reque&s;t
that you will change this &s;ubject,
which, with me, is a matter of pe|culiar
delicacy.&endq;</P>
<P>My uncle owned he was in the right,
and the di&s;cour&s;e took a more general
turn. Mr. Serle pa&s;&s;ed the evening with
us at our lodgings; and appeared to be
intelligent, and even entertaining; but
his di&s;po&s;ition was rather of a melancho|ly
hue. My uncle &s;ays he is a man of
uncommon parts, and unque&s;tioned pro|bity:
that his &s;ortune, which was origi|nally
&s;mall, has been greatly hurt by a
romantic &s;pirit of genero&s;ity, which he
has often di&s;played, even at the expence
of his di&s;cretion, in favour of worthle&s;s
individuals&mdash;That he had re&s;cued
Paunceford from the lowe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, when
he was bankrupt, both in means and re|putation&mdash;That
he had e&s;pou&s;ed his in|tere&s;ts
with a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, broke
with &s;everal friends, and even drawn his
<PB N="143" REF="156">
&s;word again&s;t my uncle, who had parti|cular
rea&s;ons for que&s;tioning the moral
character of the &s;aid Paunceford: that,
without Serle's countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
the other never could have embraced the
opportunity, which has rai&s;ed him to this
pinnacle of wealth: that Paunceford, in
the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his &s;ucce&s;s, had writ|ten,
from abroad, letters to different cor|re&s;pondents,
owning his obligations to
Mr. Serle, in the warme&s;t terms of ac|knowledgment,
and declaring he con|&s;idered
him&s;elf only as a factor for the
occa&s;ions of his be&s;t friend: that, without
doubt, he had made declarations of the
&s;ame nature to his benefactor him&s;elf,
though this la&s;t was always &s;ilent and re|&s;erved
on the &s;ubject; but for &s;ome years,
tho&s;e tropes and figures of rhetoric had
been di&s;u&s;ed: that, upon his return to
England, he had been lavi&s;h in his ca|re&s;&s;es
to Mr. Serle, invited him to his
hou&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ed him to make it his
own: that he had overwhelmed him with
general profe&s;&s;ions, and affected to ex|pre&s;s
the warme&s;t regard for him, in com|pany
of their common acquaintance; &s;o
that every body believed his gratitude
was as liberal as his fortune; and &s;ome
<PB N="144" REF="157">
went &s;o far as to congratulate Mr. Serle
on both.</P>
<P>All this time Paunceford carefully and
artfully avoided particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ions
with his old patron, who had too much
&s;pirit to drop the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of
balancing the account of obligation:
that, neverthele&s;s, a man of his feelings
could not but re&s;ent this &s;hocking return
for all his kindne&s;s; and, therefore, he
withdrew him&s;elf from the connexion,
without coming to the lea&s;t explanation,
or &s;peaking a &s;yllable on the &s;ubject to
any living &s;oul; &s;o that now their corre|&s;pondence
is reduced to a &s;light &s;alute
with the hat, when they chance to meet
in any public place; an accident that
rarely happens, for their walks lie diffe|rent
ways. Mr. Paunceford lives in a
palace, feeds upon dainties, is arrayed in
&s;umptuous apparel, appears in all the
pomp of equipage, and pa&s;&s;es his time
among the nobles of the land. Serle
lodges in Stall-&s;treet, up two pair of &s;tairs
backwards, walks a-foot in a Bath-rug,
eats for twelve &s;hillings a-week, and
drinks water as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t
the gout and gravel&mdash;Mark the vici&s;&s;i|tude.
Paunceford once re&s;ided in a gar|ret;
<PB N="145" REF="158">
where he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon &s;heeps'-trot|ters
and cow-heel, from which com|mons
he was tran&s;lated to the table of
Serle, that ever abounded with good|chear;
until want of oeconomy and re|tention,
reduced him to a &s;lender annuity
in his decline of years, that &s;carce affords
the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life&mdash;Paunceford,
however, does him the honour to &s;peak
of him &s;till, with uncommon regard; and
to declare what plea&s;ure it would give
him to contribute in any &s;hape to his con|venience:
&startq;But you know, (he never
fails to add) he's a &s;hy kind of a man
&mdash;And then &s;uch a perfect philo&s;opher,
that he looks upon all &s;uperfluities with
the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt.&endq;</P>
<P>Having given you this &s;ketch of '&s;quire
Paunceford, I need not make any com|ment
on his character, but leave it at the
mercy of your own reflection; from
which, I dare &s;ay, it will meet with as

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.</OPENER>
<P>YOU are in the right, dear Phillips;
I don't expect regular an&s;wers to every
letter&mdash;I know a college-life is too cir|cum&s;cribed
to afford materials for &s;uch
quick returns of communication. For
my part, I am continually &s;hifting the
&s;cene, and &s;urrounded with new objects;
&s;ome of which are &s;triking enough. I
&s;hall therefore conclude my journal for
your amu&s;ement; and though, in all ap|pearance,
it will not treat of very impor|tant
or intere&s;ting particulars, it may
prove, perhaps, not altogether unin&s;truc|tive
and unentertaining.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ick and entertainments of Bath
are over for this &s;ea&s;on; and all our gay
birds of pa&s;&s;age have taken their flight to
Bri&s;tol-well, Tunbridge, Brighthelm&s;tone,
Scarborough, Harrowgate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not a
&s;oul is &s;een in this place, but a few bro|ken-winded
par&s;ons, waddling like &s;o
<PB N="151" REF="164">
many crows along the North Parade.
There is always a great &s;hew of the cler|gy
at Bath: none of your thin, puny,
yellow, hectic figures, exhau&s;ted with
ab&s;tinence and hard &s;tudy, labouring un|der
the <HI>morbi eruditorum;</HI> but great over|grown
dignitaries and rectors, with rubi|cund
no&s;es and gouty ancles, or broad
bloated faces, dragging along great
&s;wag bellies; the emblems of &s;loth and
indige&s;tion&mdash;</P>
<P>Now we are upon the &s;ubject of par|&s;ons,
I mu&s;t tell you a ludicrous adven|ture,
which was atchieved the other day
by Tom Ea&s;tgate, whom you may re|member
on the foundation of Queen's.
He had been very a&s;&s;iduous to pin him&s;elf
upon George Prankley, who was a
gentleman-commoner of Chri&s;t-church,
knowing the &s;aid Prankley was heir to a
con&s;iderable e&s;tate, and would have the
advow&s;on of a good living, the incum|bent
of which was very old and infirm.
He &s;tudied his pa&s;&s;ions, and flattered them
&s;o effectually, as to become his compa|nion
and coun&s;ellor; and, at la&s;t, obtained
of him a promi&s;e of the pre&s;entation, when
the living &s;hould fall. Prankley, on his
uncle's death, quitted Oxford, and made
his fir&s;t appearance in the fa&s;hionable
<PB N="152" REF="165">
world at London; from whence he came
lately to Bath, where he has been exhi|biting
him&s;elf among the bucks and
game&s;ters of the place. Ea&s;tgate followed
him hither; but he &s;hould not have quit|ted
him for a moment, at his fir&s;t emer|ging
into life. He ought to have known
he was a fanta&s;tic, fooli&s;h, fickle fellow,
who would forget his college-attachments
the moment they cea&s;ed appealing to his
&s;en&s;es. Tom met with a cold reception
from his old friend; and was, moreover,
informed, that he had promi&s;ed the liv|ing
to another man, who had a vote in
the county, where he propo&s;ed to offer
him&s;elf a candidate at the next general
election. He now remembered nothing
of Ea&s;tgate, but the freedoms he had
u&s;ed to take with him, while Tom had
quietly &s;tood his butt, with an eye to the
benefice; and tho&s;e freedoms he began
to repeat in common place &s;arca&s;ms on
his per&s;on and his cloth, which he utter|ed
in the public coffee-hou&s;e, for the en|tertainment
of the company. But he
was egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken in giving his
own wit credit for that tamene&s;s of Ea&s;t|gate,
which had been entirely owing to
prudential con&s;iderations. The&s;e being
now removed, he retorted his repartee
<PB N="153" REF="166">
with intere&s;t, and &s;ound no great diffi|culty
in turning the laugh upon the ag|gre&s;&s;or;
who, lo&s;ing his temper, called
him names, and a&s;ked, <HI>If he knew whom
he talked to?</HI> After much altercation,
Prankley, &s;haking his cane, bid him hold
his tongue, otherwi&s;e he would du&s;t his
ca&s;&s;ock for him. &startq;I have no preten&s;i|ons
to &s;uch a valet; (&s;aid Tom) but if
you &s;hould do me that office, and over|heat
your&s;elf, I have here a good
oaken towel at your &s;ervice.&endq;</P>
<P>Prankley was equally incen&s;ed and con|founded
at this reply. After a moment's
pau&s;e, he took him a&s;ide towards the
window; and, pointing to the clump of
firs on Clerken-down, a&s;ked in a whi&s;per,
if he had &s;pirit enough to meet him there,
with a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, at &s;ix o'clock to|morrow
morning. Ea&s;tgate an&s;wered in
the affirmative; and, with a &s;teady coun|tenance,
a&s;&s;ured him, he would not fail to
give him the rendezvous at the hour he
mentioned. So &s;aying, he retired; and
the challenger &s;tayed &s;ome time in mani|fe&s;t
agitation. In the morning, Ea&s;t|gate,
who knew his man, and had taken
his re&s;olution, went to Prankley's lodg|ings,
and rou&s;ed him by &s;ive o'clock&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="167">
The '&s;quire, in all probability, cur&s;ed
his punctuality in his heart, but he af|fected
to talk big; and having prepared
his artillery over-night, they cro&s;&s;ed the
water at the end of the South Parade. In
their progre&s;s up the hill, Prankley often
eyed the par&s;on, in hopes of perceiving
&s;ome reluctance in his countenance; but
as no &s;uch marks appeared, he attempted
to intimidate him by word of mouth.
&startq;If the&s;e flints do their office, (&s;aid he)
I'll do thy bu&s;ine&s;s in a few minutes.&endq;
&startq;I de&s;ire you will do your be&s;t; (re|plied
the other) for my part, I come
not here to trifle. Our lives are in the
hands of God; and one of us already
totters on the brink of eternity&mdash;&endq;
This remark &s;eemed to make &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion
upon the '&s;quire, who changed
countenance, and with a faultering ac|cent
ob&s;erved, &startq;That it ill became a
clergyman to be concerned in quarrels
and blood-&s;hed&mdash;&endq; &startq;Your in&s;olence
to me (&s;aid Ea&s;tgate) I &s;hould have
bore with patience, had not you ca&s;t
the mo&s;t infamous reflections upon my
order, the honour of which I think
my&s;elf in duty bound to maintain,
even at the expence of my heart's
blood; and &s;urely it can be no crime
<PB N="155" REF="168">
to put out of the world a profligate
wretch, without any &s;en&s;e of principle,
morality, or religion&mdash;&endq; &startq;Thou
may'&s;t take away my life, (cried
Prankley, in great perturbation) but
don't go to murder my character.&mdash;
What! has't got no con&s;cience?&endq;
&startq;My con&s;cience is perfectly quiet (re|plied
the other); and now, &s;ir, we are
upon the &s;pot&mdash;Take your ground as
near as you plea&s;e; prime your pi&s;tol;
and the Lord, of his infinite mercy,
have compa&s;&s;ion upon your mi&s;erable
&s;oul!&endq;</P>
<P>This ejaculation he pronounced in a
loud &s;olemn tone, with his hat off, and
his eyes lifted up; then drawing a large
hor&s;e pi&s;tol, he pre&s;ented, and put him|&s;elf
in a po&s;ture of action. Prankley took
his di&s;tance, and endeavoured to prime,
but his hand &s;hook with &s;uch violence,
that he found this operation impractible
&mdash;His antagoni&s;t, &s;eeing how it was with
him, offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and advanced
for that purpo&s;e; when the poor '&s;quire,
exceedingly alarmed at what he had
heard and &s;een, de&s;ired the action might
be deferred till next day, as he had not
&s;ettled his affairs. &startq;I ha'n't made my
will (&s;aid he); my &s;i&s;ters are not pro|vided
<PB N="156" REF="169">
for; and I ju&s;t now recollect an
old promi&s;e, which my con&s;cience tells
me I ought to perform&mdash;I'll fir&s;t con|vince
thee, that I'm not a wretch with|out

have an opportunity to take my life,
which thou &s;eem'&s;t to thir&s;t after &s;o

<P>Ea&s;tgate under&s;tood the hint; and told
him, that one day &s;hould break no
&s;quares; adding, &startq;God forbid that I
&s;hould be the means of hindering you
from acting the part of an hone&s;t man,
and a dutiful brother&mdash;&endq; By virtue
of this ce&s;&s;ation, they returned peaceably
together. Prankley forthwith made out
the pre&s;entation of the living, and deli|vered
it to Ea&s;tgate, telling him at the
&s;ame time, he had now &s;ettled his affairs,
and was ready to attend him to the Fir|grove;
but Tom declared he could not
think of lifting his hand again&s;t the life
of &s;o great a benefactor&mdash;He did more:
when they next met at the coffee hou&s;e,
he a&s;ked pardon of Mr. Prankley, if in
his pa&s;&s;ion he had &s;aid any thing to give
him offence; and the '&s;quire was &s;o gra|cious
as to forgive him with a cordial
&s;hake of the hand, declaring that he
did not like to be at variance with an old

he left Bath abruptly; and then Ea&s;t|gate

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>I SHALL to-morrow &s;et out for Lon|don,
where I have be&s;poke lodgings, at
Mrs. Norton's in Golden-&s;quare. Al|though
I am no admirer of Bath, I &s;hall
<PB N="158" REF="171">
leave it with regret; becau&s;e I mu&s;t part
with &s;ome old friends, whom, in all pro|bability,
I &s;hall never &s;ee again. In the
cour&s;e of coffee-hou&s;e conver&s;ation, I had
often heard very extraordinary enco|miums
pa&s;&s;es on the performances of Mr.
T&mdash;, a gentleman re&s;iding in this
place, who paints land&s;capes for his
amu&s;ement. As I have no great confi|dence
in the ta&s;te and judgment of coffee-hou&s;e
connoi&s;&s;eurs, and never received
much plea&s;ure from this branch of the art,
tho&s;e general prai&s;es made no impre&s;&s;ion
at all on my curio&s;ity; but, at the reque&s;t
of a particular friend, I went ye&s;terday to
&s;ee the pieces, which had been &s;o warmly
commended&mdash;I mu&s;t own I am no judge
of painting, though very fond of pic|tures.
I don't imagine that my &s;en&s;es
would play me &s;o fal&s;e, as to betray me
into admiration of any thing that was
very bad; but, true it is, I have often
over-looked capital beauties, in pieces
of extraordinary merit.&mdash;If I am not to|tally
devoid of ta&s;te, however, this young
gentleman of Bath is the be&s;t land&s;cape-painter
now living: I was &s;truck with his
performances in &s;uch a manner, as I had
never been by painting before. His trees
not only have a richne&s;s of foliage and
<PB N="159" REF="172">
warmth of colouring, which delights the
view; but al&s;o a certain magnificence in the
di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;pirit in the expre&s;&s;ion,
which I cannot de&s;cribe. His manage|ment
of the <HI>chiaro o&s;curo,</HI> or light and
&s;hadow, e&s;pecially gleams of &s;hun-&s;hine,
is altogether wonderful, both in the con|trivance
and execution; and he is &s;o hap|py
in his per&s;pective, and marking his
di&s;tances at &s;ea, by a progre&s;&s;ive &s;eries of
&s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, capes, and promontories,
that I could not help thinking, I had a
di&s;tant view of thirty leagues upon the
back-ground of the picture. If there is
any ta&s;te for ingenuity left in a degene|rate
age, fa&s;t &s;inking into barbari&s;m, this
arti&s;t, I apprehend, will make a capital
figure, as &s;oon as his works are known&mdash;</P>
<P>Two days ago, I was favoured with a
vi&s;it by Mr. Fitz-owen; who, with great
formality, &s;olicited my vote and intere&s;t
at the general election. I ought not to
have been &s;hocked at the confidence of
this man; though it was remarkable, con|&s;idering
what had pa&s;&s;ed between him
and me on a former occa&s;ion&mdash;The&s;e
vi&s;its are mere matter of form, which a
candidate makes to every elector; even
to tho&s;e who, he knows, are engaged in
the intere&s;t of his competitor, le&s;t he
<PB N="160" REF="173">
&s;hould expo&s;e him&s;elf to the imputation
of pride, at a time when it is expected he
&s;hould appear humble. Indeed, I know
nothing &s;o abject as the behaviour of a
man canva&s;&s;ing for a &s;eat in parliament
&mdash;This mean pro&s;tration, (to borough-electors,
e&s;pecially) has, I imagine, con|tributed
in a great mea&s;ure to rai&s;e that
&s;pirit of in&s;olence among the vulgar;
which, like the devil, will be found very
difficult to lay. Be that as it may, I was
in &s;ome confu&s;ion at the effrontery of
Fitz-owen; but I &s;oon recollected my&s;elf,
and told him, I had not yet determined
for whom I &s;hould give my vote, nor
whether I &s;hould give it for any.&mdash;The
truth is, I look upon both candidates in
the &s;ame light; and &s;hould think my&s;elf
a traitor to the con&s;titution of my coun|try,
if I voted for either. If every elec|tor
would bring the &s;ame con&s;ideration
home to his con&s;cience, we &s;hould not
have &s;uch rea&s;on to exclaim again&s;t the
venality of p&mdash;ts. But we are all a
pack of venal and corrupted ra&s;cals; &s;o
lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of hone&s;ty, and all ten|derne&s;s
of character, that, in a little time,
I am fully per&s;uaded, nothing will be in|famous
but virtue and public-&s;pirit.</P>

G. H&mdash;, who is really an enthu&s;ia&s;t

to me t'other day, with the tears in his
eyes, that he had lived above thirty years
in the city of London, and dealt in the
way of commerce with all the citizens of
note in their turns; but that, as he &s;hould
an&s;wer to God, he had never, in the
whole cour&s;e of his life, found above
three or four whom he could call tho|roughly
hone&s;t: a declaration, which was
rather mortifying than &s;urpri&s;ing to me;
who have found &s;o few men of worth in
the cour&s;e of my acquaintance, that they
&s;erve only as exceptions; which, in the
grammarian's phra&s;e, confirm and prove
a general canon&mdash;I know you will &s;ay,
G. H&mdash;&s;aw imperfectly through the
mi&s;t of prejudice, and I am rankled

in the right; for I have perceived that

ju&s;tice to the farm, give him a di&s;charge
<PB N="162" REF="175">
for the rent that is due: this will animate
his indu&s;try; for I know that nothing is
&s;o di&s;couraging to a farmer, as the
thoughts of being in arrears with his land|lord.
He becomes di&s;pirited, and ne|glects
his labour; and &s;o the farm goes
to wreck. Tabby has been clamouring
for &s;ome days about the lamb's &s;kin,

<LETTER>
<PB N="165" REF="178">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>WITHOUT waiting for your an&s;wer
to my la&s;t, I proceed to give you an ac|count
of our journey to London, which
has not been wholly barren of adventure.
Tue&s;day la&s;t, the '&s;quire took his place
in a hired coach and four, accompanied
by his &s;i&s;ter and mine, and Mrs. Tabby's
maid, Winifrid Jenkins, who&s;e province
it was to &s;upport Chowder on a cu&s;hion
in her lap. I could &s;carce refrain from
laughing, when I looked into the vehicle,
and &s;aw that animal &s;itting oppo&s;ite to my
uncle, like any other pa&s;&s;enger. The
'&s;quire, a&s;hamed of his &s;ituation, blu&s;h|ed
to the eyes: and, calling to the po&s;ti|lions
to drive on, pulled the gla&s;s up in
my face. I, and his &s;ervant John Tho|mas,
attended them on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Nothing worth mentioning occured,
till we arrived on the edge of Marlbo|rough
<PB N="166" REF="179">
Downs. There one of the fore
hor&s;es fell, in going down hill at a round
trot; and the po&s;tilion behind, en|deavouring
to &s;top the carriage, pulled it
on one &s;ide into a deep rut, where it was
fairly overturned. I had rode on about
two hundred yards before; but, hear|ing
a loud &s;cream, galloped back and
di&s;mounted, to give what a&s;&s;i&s;tance was
in my power. When I looked into the
coach, I could &s;ee nothing di&s;tinctly, but
the nether end of Jenkins, who was kick|ing
her heels and &s;qualling with great
vociferation. All of a &s;udden, my un|cle
thru&s;t up his bare pate, and bolted
through t$e window, as nimble as a gra&s;|hopper,
having made u&s;e of poor Win's
po&s;teriors as a &s;tep to ri&s;e in his a&s;cent&mdash;
The man (who had likewi&s;e quitted his
hor&s;e) dragged this forlorn dam&s;el, more
dead than alive, through the &s;ame open|ing.
Then Mr. Bramble, pulling the
door off its hinges with a jerk, laid hold
on Liddy's arm, and brought her to the
light; very much frighted, but little
hurt. It fell to my &s;hare to deliver our
aunt Tabitha, who had lo&s;t her cap in
the &s;truggle; and being rather more than
half frantic, with rage and terror, was
no bad repre&s;entation of one of the &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="167" REF="180">
Furies that guard the gates of hell&mdash;
She expre&s;&s;ed no &s;ort of concern for her
brother, who ran about in the cold, with|out
his periwig, and worked with the
mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing agility, in helping to di&s;|entangle
the hor&s;es from the carriage:
but &s;he cried, in a tone of di&s;traction,
&startq;Chowder! Chowder! my dear Chow|der!
my poor Chowder is certainly
killed!&endq;</P>
<P>This was not the ca&s;e&mdash;Chowder, af|ter
having tore my uncle's leg in the con|fu&s;ion
of the fall, had retreated under the
&s;eat, and from thence the footman drew
him by the neck; for which good office,
he bit his fingers to the bone. The fel|low,
who is naturally &s;urly, was &s;o pro|voked
at this a&s;&s;ault, that he &s;aluted his
ribs with a hearty kick, exclaiming,
&startq;Damn the na&s;ty &s;on of a bitch, and them
he belongs to!&endq; A benediction, which
was by no means lo&s;t upon the implac|able
virago his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Her brother,
however, prevailed upon her, to retire
into a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e, near the &s;cene of
action, where his head and her's were
covered, and poor Jenkins had a fit&mdash;
Our next care was to apply &s;ome &s;tick|ing
pla&s;ter to the wound in his leg, which
exhibited the impre&s;&s;ion of Chowder's
<PB N="168" REF="181">
teeth; but he never opened his lips
again&s;t the delinquent&mdash;Mrs. Tabby,
alarmed at this &s;cene, &startq;You &s;ay nothing,
Matt (cried &s;he); but I know your
mind&mdash;I know the &s;pite you have to
that poor unfortunate animal! I know
you intend to take his life away!&endq;
&startq;You are mi&s;taken, upon my honour!
(replied the '&s;quire, with a &s;arca&s;tic
&s;mile) I &s;hould be incapable of har|bouring
any &s;uch cruel de&s;ign again&s;t
an object &s;o amiable and inoffen&s;ive;
even if he had not the happine&s;s to be
your favourite.&endq;</P>
<P>John Thomas was not &s;o delicate. The
fellow, whether really alarmed for his
life, or in&s;tigated by the de&s;ire of re|venge,
came in, and bluntly demanded,
that the dog &s;hould be put to death; on
the &s;uppo&s;ition, that if ever he &s;hould run
mad hereafter, he, who had been bit by
him, would be infected&mdash;My uncle calm|ly
argued upon the ab&s;urdity of his opi|nion,
ob&s;erving, that he him&s;elf was in
the &s;ame predicament, and would cer|tainly
take the precaution he propo&s;ed,
if he was not &s;ure he ran no ri&s;que of in|fection.
Neverthele&s;s, Thomas continu|ed
ob&s;tinate; and, at length declared,
that if the dog was not &s;hot immediately,
<PB N="169" REF="182">
he him&s;elf would be his executioner&mdash;
This declaration opened the flood-gates
of Tabby's eloquence, which would have
&s;hamed the fir&s;t-rate oratre&s;s of Billing&s;|gate.
The footman retorted in the &s;ame
&s;tile; and the '&s;quire di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from
his &s;ervice, after having prevented me
from giving him a good hor&s;e-whipping
for his in&s;olence.</P>
<P>The coach being adju&s;ted, another dif|ficulty
occured&mdash;Mrs. Tabitha ab&s;olutely
refu&s;ed to enter it again, unle&s;s another
driver could be found to take the place
of the po&s;ition; who, &s;he affirmed, had
overturned the carriage from malice a|forethought&mdash;After
much di&s;pute, the
man re&s;igned his place to a &s;habby coun|try
fellow, who undertook to go as far as
Marlborough, where they could be bet|ter
provided; and at that place we ar|rived
about one o'clock, without farther
impediment. Mrs. Bramble, however,
found new matter of offence; which, in|deed,
&s;he had a particular genius for ex|tracting
at will from almo&s;t every inci|dent
in life. We had &s;carce entered the
room at Marlborough, where we &s;tayed
to dine, when &s;he exhibited a formal
complaint again&s;t the poor fellow who
had &s;uper&s;eded the po&s;tilion. She &s;aid,
<PB N="170" REF="183">
he was &s;uch a beggarly ra&s;cal, that he had
ne'er a &s;hirt to his back; and had the
impudence to &s;hock her &s;ight by &s;hew|ing
his bare po&s;teriors, for which act of
indelicacy he de&s;erved to be &s;et in the
flocks. Mrs. Winifred Jenkins confirm|ed
the a&s;&s;ertion, with re&s;pect to his naked|ne&s;s,
ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that he
had a &s;kin as fair as alaba&s;ter.</P>
<P>&startq;This is a heinous offence, indeed,
(cried my uncle) let us hear what the
fellow has to &s;ay in his own vindica|tion.&endq;
He was accordingly &s;ummon|ed,
and made his appearance, which was
equally queer and pathetic. He &s;eemed
to be about twenty years of age, of a
middling &s;ize, with bandy legs, &s;toop|ing
&s;houlders, high forehead, &s;andy locks,
pinking eyes, flat no&s;e, and long chin&mdash;but
his complexion was of a &s;ickly yel|low:
his looks denoted famine; and the
rags that he wore, could hardly conceal
what decency requires to be covered&mdash;
My uncle, having &s;urveyed him atten|tively,
&s;aid, with an ironical expre&s;&s;ion in
his countenance, &startq;An't you a&s;hamed,
fellow, to ride po&s;tilion without a &s;hirt
to cover your back&s;ide from the view
of the ladies in the coach?&endq; &startq;Yes,
I am, an plea&s;e your noble honour;
<PB N="171" REF="184">
(an&s;wered the man) but nece&s;&s;ity has
no law, as the &s;aying is&mdash;And more
than that, it was an accident&mdash;My
breeches cracked behind, after I had
got into the &s;addle&mdash;&endq; &startq;You're an
impudent varlet, (cried Mrs. Tabby)
for pre&s;uming to ride before per&s;ons of
fa&s;hion without a &s;hirt&mdash;&endq; &startq;I am
&s;o, an plea&s;e your worthy lady&s;hip;
(&s;aid he) but I'am a poor Wilt&s;hire lad,
&mdash;I ha'n't a &s;hirt in the world, that I
can call my own, nor a rag of clothes,
an plea&s;e your lady&s;hip, but what you
&s;ee&mdash;I have no friend, nor relation up|on
earth to help me out&mdash;I have had
the fever and ague the&s;e &s;ix months,
and &s;pent all I had in the world upon
doctors, and to keep &s;oul and body
together; and, &s;aving your lady&s;hip's
good pre&s;ence, I han't broke bread
the&s;e four and twenty hours&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Bramble, turning from him, &s;aid,
&s;he had never &s;een &s;uch a filthy tatterde|malion,
and bid him begone; ob&s;erv|ing,
that he would fill the room full of
vermin&mdash;Her brother darted a &s;ignificant
glance at her, as &s;he retired with Liddy
into another apartment; and then a&s;ked
the man if he was known to any per&s;on
in Marlborough?&mdash;When he an&s;wered,
<PB N="172" REF="185">
that the landlord of the inn had known
him from his infancy; mine ho&s;t was
immediately called, and being interroga|ted
on the &s;ubject, declared that the
young fellow's name was Humphry Clin|ker.
That he had been a love begotten
babe, brought up in the work-hou&s;e, and
put out apprentice by the pari&s;h to a
country black-&s;mith, who died before the
boy's time was out: that he had for &s;ome
time worked under his o&s;tler, as a helper
and extra po&s;tilion, till he was taken ill
of the ague, which di&s;abled him from
getting his bread: that, having &s;old or
pawned every thing he had in the world
for his cure and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he became
&s;o mi&s;erable and &s;habby, that he di&s;graced
the &s;table, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; but that
he never heard any thing to the prejudice
of his character in other re&s;pects. &startq;So
that the fellow being &s;ick and de&s;ti|tute,
(&s;aid my uncle) you turned him
out to die in the &s;treets.&endq; &startq;I pay the
poors' rate, (replied the other) and I
have no right to maintain id$e va|grants,
either in &s;ickne&s;s or health;
be&s;ides, &s;uch a mi&s;erable object would
have brought a di&s;credit upon my
hou&s;e&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="186">
&startq;You perceive (&s;aid the '&s;quire, turn|ing
to me) our landlord is a Chri&s;tian
of bowels&mdash;Who &s;hall pre&s;ume to cen|&s;ure
the morals of the age, when the
very publicans exhibit &s;uch examples
of humanity?&mdash;Heark ye, Clinker,
you are a mo&s;t notorious offender&mdash;
You &s;tand convicted of &s;ickne&s;s, hun|ger,
wretchedne&s;s, and want&mdash;But, as
it does not belong to me to puni&s;h cri|minals,
I will only take upon me the
ta&s;k of giving you a word of advice&mdash;
Get a &s;hirt with all convenient di&s;|patch,
that your nakedne&s;s may not
henceforward give offence to travelling
gentlewomen, e&s;pecially maidens in
years&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he put a guinea into the
hand of the poor fellow, who &s;tood &s;tar|ing
at him in &s;ilence, with his mouth
wide open, till the landlord pu&s;hed him
out of the room.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, as our aunt &s;tept in|to
the coach, &s;he ob&s;erved, with &s;ome
marks of &s;atisfaction, that the po&s;tilion,
who rode next to her, was not a &s;habby
wretch like the ragamuffin who had drove
them into Marlborough. Indeed, the
difference was very con&s;picuous: this
was a &s;mart fellow, with a narrow brim|med
<PB N="174" REF="187">
hat, with gold cording, a cut bob,
a decent blue jacket, leather breeches, and
a clean linen &s;hirt, puffed above the
wai&s;t-band. When we arrived at the
ca&s;tle on Spin-hill, where we lay, this
new po&s;tilion was remarkably a&s;&s;iduous,
in bringing in the loo&s;e parcels; and, at
length, di&s;played the individual counte|nance
of Humphry Clinker, who had
metamorpo&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner, by
relieving from pawn part of his own
clothes, with the money he had received
from Mr. Bramble.</P>
<P>How&s;oever plea&s;ed the re&s;t of the com|pany
were with &s;uch a favourable change
in the appearance of this poor creature,
it &s;oured on the &s;tomach of Mrs. Tabby,
who had not yet dige&s;ted the affront of
his naked &s;kin&mdash;She to&s;&s;ed her no&s;e in
di&s;dain, &s;aying, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her brother
had taken him into favour, becau&s;e he
had in&s;ulted her with his ob&s;cenity: that
a fool and his money were &s;oon parted;
but that if Matt intended to take the fel|low
with him to London, &s;he would not
go a-foot further that way&mdash;My uncle
&s;aid nothing with his tongue, though his
looks were &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive; and
next morning Clinker did not appear,
&s;o that we proceeded without further al|tercation
<PB N="175" REF="188">
to Salt-hill, where we propo&s;ed
to dine&mdash;There, the fir&s;t per&s;on that came
to the &s;ide of the coach, and began to
adju&s;t the foot-board, was no other than
Humphry Clinker&mdash;When I handed out
Mrs. Bramble, &s;he eyed him with a fu|rious
look, and pa&s;&s;ed into the hou&s;e&mdash;
My uncle was embarra&s;&s;ed, and a&s;ked him
peevi&s;hly, what had brought him hither?
The fellow &s;aid, his honour had been &s;o
good to him, that he had not the heart to
part with him; that he would follow him
to the world's end, and &s;erve him all the
days of his life, without fee or reward&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble did not know whether to
chide or laugh at this declaration&mdash;He
fore&s;aw much contradiction on the &s;ide of
Tabby; and, on the other hand, he could
not but be plea&s;ed with the gratitude of
Clinker, as well as with the &s;implicity of
his character&mdash;&startq;Suppo&s;e I was inclined
to take you into my &s;ervice, (&s;aid he)
what are your qualifications? what are
you good for?&endq; &startq;An plea&s;e your
honour, (an&s;wered this original) I can
read and write, and do the bu&s;ine&s;s of
the &s;table indifferent well&mdash;I can dre&s;s
a hor&s;e, and &s;hoe him, and bleed and
rowel him; and, as for the practice of
&s;ow-gelding, I won't turn my back on
<PB N="176" REF="189">
e'er a he in the county of Wilts&mdash;
Then I can make hog's puddings and
hob-nails, mend kettles, and tin &s;auce|pans&mdash;&endq;
Here uncle bur&s;t out a-laugh|ing;
and enquired, what other accom|pli&s;hments
he was ma&s;ter of&mdash;&startq;I know
&s;omething of &s;ingle-&s;tick, and p&s;almo|dy,
(proceeded Clinker) I can play up|on
the Jew's-harp, &s;ing Black-ey'd
Su&s;an, Arthur-o'Bradley, and divers
other &s;ongs; I can dance a Wel&s;h jig,
and Nancy Daw&s;on; wre&s;tle a fall with
any lad of my inches, when I'm in
heart; and, under correction, I can
find a hare when your honour wants a
bit of game.&endq; &startq;Foregad! thou art
a complete fellow, (cried my uncle,
&s;till laughing) I have a good mind to
take thee into my family&mdash;Pr'ythee,
go and try if thou can'&s;t make peace
with my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;Thou ha'&s;t given her
much offence by &s;hewing her thy naked
tail.&endq;</P>
<P>Clinker accordingly followed us into
the room, cap in hand, where, addre&s;|&s;ing
him&s;elf to Mrs. Tabitha, &startq;May it
plea&s;e your lady&s;hip's wor&s;hip (cried
he) to pardon and forgive my offences,
and, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall take
care that my tail &s;hall never ri&s;e up in
<PB N="177" REF="190">
judgment again&s;t me, to offend your
lady&s;hip again&mdash;Do, pray, good,
&s;weet, beautiful lady, take compa&s;&s;ion
on a poor &s;inner&mdash;God ble&s;s your no|ble
countenance; I am &s;ure you are
too hand&s;ome and generous to bear
malice&mdash;I will &s;erve you on my bend|ed
knees, by night and by day, by
land and by water; and all for the
love and plea&s;ure of &s;erving &s;uch an ex|cellent
lady&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>This compliment and humiliation had
&s;ome effect upon Tabby; but &s;he made
no reply; and Clinker, taking &s;ilence for
con&s;ent, gave his attendance at dinner.
The fellow's natural aukwardne&s;s and
the flutter of his &s;pirits were productive
of repeated blunders in the cour&s;e of his
attendance&mdash;At length, he &s;pilt part of a
cu&s;tard upon her right &s;houlder; and,
&s;tarting back, trod upon Chowder, who
&s;et up a di&s;mal howl&mdash;Poor Humphry
was &s;o di&s;concerted at this double mi&s;|take,
that he dropt the china di&s;h, which
broke into a thou&s;and pieces; then, fall|ing
down upon his knees, remained in
that po&s;ture gaping, with a mo&s;t ludi|crous
a&s;pect of di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Mrs. Bramble
flew to the dog, and, &s;natching him in
her arms, pre&s;ented him to her brother,
<PB N="178" REF="191">
&s;aying, &startq;This is all a concerted &s;cheme
again&s;t this unfortunate animal, who&s;e
only crime is its regard for me&mdash;Here
it is: kill it at once; and then you'll
be &s;atisfied.&endq;</P>
<P>Clinker, hearing the&s;e words, and tak|ing
them in the literal acceptation, got
up in &s;ome hurry, and, &s;eizing a knife
from the &s;ide-board, cried, &startq;Not here,
an plea&s;e your lady&s;hip&mdash;It will daub
the room&mdash;Give him to me, and I'll
carry him in the ditch by the road|&s;ide&mdash;&endq;
To this propo&s;al he receiv|no
other an&s;wer, than a hearty box on the
ear, that made him &s;tagger to the other
&s;ide of the room. &startq;What! (&s;aid &s;he to
her brother) am I to be affronted by
every mangy hound that you pick up
in the highway? I in&s;i&s;t upon your
&s;ending this ra&s;callion about his bu&s;i|ne&s;s
immediately&mdash;&endq; &startq;For God's
&s;ake, &s;i&s;ter, compo&s;e your&s;elf, (&s;aid my
uncle) and con&s;ider, that the poor fel|low
is innocent of any intention to give
you offence&mdash;&endq; &startq;Innocent as the babe
unborn&endq;&mdash;(cried Humphry.) &startq;I &s;ee
it plainly, (exclaimed this implacable
maiden) he acts by your direction; and
you are re&s;olved to &s;upport him in his
impudence&mdash;This is a bad return for
<PB N="179" REF="192">
all the &s;ervices I have done you; for
nur&s;ing you in your &s;ickne&s;s, manag|ing
your family, and keeping you

now you &s;hall part
with that ra&s;cal or me, upon the &s;pot,
without farther lo&s;s of time; and the
world &s;hall &s;ee whether you have more
regard for your own fle&s;h and blood,
or for a beggarly foundling, taken
from the dunghill&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble's eyes began to gli&s;ten,
and his teeth to chatter. &startq;If &s;tated
fairly, (&s;aid he, rai&s;ing his voice) the
que&s;tion is, whether I have &s;pirit to
&s;hake off an intolerable yoke, by one
effort of re&s;olution, or meanne&s;s
enough to do an act of cruelty and
inju&s;tice, to gratify the rancour of a
capricious woman&mdash;Heark ye, Mrs.
Tabitha Bramble, I will now propo&s;e
an alternative in my turn&mdash;Either di&s;|card
your four-footed favourite, or
give me leave to bid you eternally
adieu&mdash;For I am determined, that he
and I &s;hall live no longer under the
&s;ame roof: and now <HI>to dinner with
what appetite you may&mdash;</HI>&endq; Thunder|&s;truck
at this declaration, &s;he &s;at down in
a corner; and, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome
<PB N="180" REF="193">
minutes, &startq;Sure I don't under&s;tand you,
Matt! (&s;aid &s;he)&endq; &startq;And yet I &s;poke
in plain Engli&s;h&mdash;&endq; an&s;wered the
&s;quire, with a peremptory look. &startq;Sir,
(re&s;umed this virago, effectually hum|bled)
it is your prerogative to com|mand,
and my duty to obey. I can't
di&s;po&s;e of the dog in this place; but
if you'll allow him to go in the coach
to London, I give you my word, he
&s;hall never trouble you again&mdash;&endq;</P>

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>LONDON is literally new to me; new
in its &s;treets, hou&s;es, and even in its &s;itu|ation;
as the Iri&s;hman &s;aid, &startq;London is
now gone out of town.&endq; What I left
open fields, producing hay and corn, I
now find covered with &s;treets, and &s;quares,
and palaces, and churches. I am credi|bly
informed, that in the &s;pace of &s;even
years, eleven thou&s;and new hou&s;es have
been built in one quarter of We&s;tmin&s;ter,
exclu&s;ive of what is daily added to other
parts of this unweildy metropolis. Pim|lico
and Knight&s;bridge are now almo&s;t
joined to Chel$ea and Ken&s;ington; and if
this infatuation continues for half a cen|tury,
I &s;uppo&s;e the whole county of Mid|dle&s;ex
will be covered with brick.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, indeed, for the
credit of the pre&s;ent age, that London
and We&s;tmin&s;ter are much better paved
and lighted than they were formerly.
<PB N="183" REF="196">
The new &s;treets are &s;pacious, regular,
and airy; and the hou&s;es generally con|venient.
The bridge at Blackfriars is a
noble monument of ta&s;te and public-&s;pi|rit&mdash;I
wonder how they &s;tumbled upon
a work of &s;uch magnificence and utility.
But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e improvements,
the capital is become an overgrown mon|&s;ter;
which, like a drop&s;ical head, will
in time leave the body and extremities
without nouri&s;hment and &s;upport. The
ab&s;urdity will appear in its full force,
when we con&s;ider, that one &s;ixth part of
the natives of this whole exten&s;ive king|dom,
is crowded within the bills of mor|tality.
What wonder that our villages
are depopulated, and our farms in want
of day-labourers? The abolition of &s;mall
farms, is but one cau&s;e of the decrea&s;e of
population. Indeed, the incredible in|crea&s;e
of hor&s;es and black cattle, to an|&s;wer
the purpo&s;es of luxury, requires a
prodigious quantity of hay and gra&s;s,
which are rai&s;ed and managed without
much labour; but a number of hands
will always be wanted for the different
branches of agriculture, whether the
farms be large or &s;mall. The tide of
luxury has &s;wept all the inhabitants fr$m
the open country&mdash;The poore&s;t '&s;quare,
<PB N="184" REF="197">
as well as the riche&s;t peer, mu&s;t have his
hou&s;e in town, and make a figure with an
extraordinary number of dome&s;tics. The
plough-boys, cow-herds, and lower hinds,
are debauched and &s;educed by the ap|pearance
and di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e coxcombs
in livery, when they make their &s;ummer
excur&s;ions. They de&s;ert their dirt and
drudgery, and &s;warm up to London, in
hopes of getting into &s;ervice, where they
can live luxuriou&s;ly and wear fine clothes,
without being obliged to work; for idle|ne&s;s
is natural to man&mdash;Great numbers
of the&s;e, being di&s;appointed in their ex|pectation,
become thieves and &s;harpers;
and London being an immen&s;e wilder|ne&s;s,
in which there is neither watch nor
ward of any &s;ignification, nor any order
or police, affords them lurking-places as
well as prey.</P>
<P>There are many cau&s;es that contribute
to the daily increa&s;e of this enormous
ma&s;s; but they may be all re&s;olved into
the grand &s;ource of luxury and corrup|tion&mdash;About
five and twenty years ago,
very few, even of the mo&s;t opulent ci|tizens
of London, kept any equipage, or
even any &s;ervants in livery. Their ta|bles
produced nothing but plain boiled
and roa&s;ted, with a bottle of port and a
<PB N="185" REF="198">
tankard of beer. At pre&s;ent, every trader
in any degree of credit, every broker
and attorney, maintains a couple of foot|men,
a coachman, and po&s;tilion. He has
his town-hou&s;e, and his country-hou&s;e,
his coach, and his po&s;tchai&s;e. His wife
and daughters appear in the riche&s;t &s;tuffs,
be&s;pangled with diamonds. They fre|quent
the court, the opera, the theatre,
and the ma&s;querade. They hold a&s;&s;em|blies
at their own hou&s;es: they make
&s;umptuous entertainments, and treat with
the riche&s;t wines of Bourdeaux, Burgun|dy,
and Champagne. The &s;ub&s;tantial
trade&s;man, who wont to pa&s;s his evenings
at the ale-hou&s;e for fourpence half-penny,
now &s;pends three &s;hillings at the tavern,
while his wife keeps card-tables at home;
&s;he mu&s;t likewi&s;e have fine clothes, her
chai&s;e, or pad, with country lodgings,
and go three times a-week to public di|ver&s;ions.
Every clerk, apprentice, and
even waiter of tavern or coffee-hou&s;e,
maintains a gelding by him&s;elf, or in
partner&s;hip, and a&s;&s;umes the air and ap|parel
of a petit maitre&mdash;The gaye&s;t
places of public entertainment are filled
with fa&s;hionable figures; which, upon
inquiry, will be found to be journeymen
<PB N="186" REF="199">
taylors, &s;erving-men, and abigails, di&s;|gui&s;ed
like their betters.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is no di&s;tinction or &s;ub|ordination
left&mdash;The different depart|ments
of life are jumbled together&mdash;The
hod-carrier, the low mechanic, the tap|&s;ter,
the publican, the &s;hop-keeper, the
pettifogger, the citizen, and courtier, <HI>all
$read upon the kibes of one another:</HI> ac|tuated
by the demons of profligacy and
licentiou&s;ne&s;s, they are &s;een every where,
rambling, riding, rolling, ru&s;hing, ju&s;tling,
mixing, bouncing, cracking, and cra&s;hing
in one vile ferment of &s;tupidity and corrup|tion&mdash;All
is tumult and hurry; one would
imagine they were impelled by &s;ome di&s;|order
of the brain, that will not &s;uffer
them to be at re&s;t. The foot-pa&s;&s;engers
run along as if they were pur&s;ued by
bailiffs. The porters and chairmen trot
with their burthens. People, who keep
their own equipages, drive through the
&s;treets at full &s;peed. Even citizens, phy|&s;icians,
and apothecaries, glide in their
chariots like lightning. The hackney-coachmen
make their hor&s;es &s;moke, and
the pavement &s;hakes under them; and I
have actually &s;een a waggon pa&s;s through
Piccadilly at the hand-gallop. In a word,
<PB N="187" REF="200">
the whole nation &s;eems to be running out
of their wits.</P>
<P>The diver&s;ions of the times are not ill
&s;uited to the genius of this incongrous
mon&s;ter, called <HI>the public.</HI> Give it noi&s;e,
confu&s;ion, glare, and glitter; it has no
idea of elegance and propriety&mdash;What are
the amu&s;ements at Ranelagh? One half
of the company are following one an|other's
tails, in an eternal circle; like &s;o
many blind a&s;&s;es in an olive-mill, where
they can neither di&s;cour&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;h,
nor be di&s;tingui&s;hed; while the other
half are drinking hot water, under the
denomination of tea, till nine or ten
o'clock at night, to keep them awake
for the re&s;t of the evening. As for the
orche&s;tra, the vocal mu&s;ick e&s;pecially, it
is well for the performers that they can|not
be heard di&s;tinctly. Vauxhall is a
compo&s;ition of baubles, overcharged with
paltry ornaments, ill conceived, and
poorly executed; without any unity of
de&s;ign, or propriety of di&s;po&s;ition. It
is an unnatural a&s;&s;embly of objects, fan|ta&s;tically
illuminated in broken ma&s;&s;es;
&s;eemingly contrived to dazzle the eyes
and divert the imagination of the vul|gar&mdash;Here
a wooden lion, there a &s;tone
&s;tatue; in one place, a range of things
<PB N="188" REF="201">
like coffee-hou&s;e boxes, covered a-top;
in another, a parcel of ale-hou&s;e benches;
in a third, a puppet-&s;hew repre&s;entation
of a tin ca&s;cade; in a fourth, a gloomy
cave of a circular form, like a &s;epulchral
vault half lighted; in a fifth, a &s;canty
&s;lip of gra&s;s-plat, that would not afford
pa&s;ture &s;ufficient for an a&s;s's colt. The
walks, which nature &s;eems to have in|tended
for &s;olitude, &s;hade, and &s;ilence,
are filled with crowds of noi&s;y people,
&s;ucking up the nocturnal rheums of an
agui&s;h climate; and through the&s;e gay
&s;cenes, a few lamps glimmer like &s;o
many farthing candles.</P>
<P>When I &s;ee a number of well $dre&s;&s;ed
people, of both &s;exes, &s;itting on the co|vered
benches, expo&s;ed to the eyes of the
mob; and, which is wor&s;e, to the cold,
raw, night-air, devouring &s;liced beef, and
&s;willing port, and punch, and cyder, I
can't help compa&s;&s;ionating their temeri|ty,
while I de&s;pi&s;e their want of ta&s;te and
decorum; but, when they cour&s;e along
tho&s;e damp and gloomy walks, or crowd
together upon the wet gravel, without
any other cover than the cope of Hea|ven,
li&s;tening to a &s;ong, which one half
of them cannot po&s;&s;ibly hear, how can I
help &s;uppo&s;ing they are actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="189" REF="202">
by a &s;pirit, more ab&s;urd and pernicious
than any thing we meet with in the pre|cincts
of Bedlam? In all probability, the
proprietors of this, and other public gar|dens
of inferior note, in the &s;kirts of the
metropolis, are, in &s;ome &s;hape, connect|ed
with the faculty of phy&s;ic, and the
company of undertakers; for, con&s;ider|ing
that eagerne&s;s in the pur&s;uit of what
is called plea&s;ure, which now predomi|nates
through every rank and denomina|tion
of life, I am per&s;uaded, that more
gouts, rheumati&s;ms, catarrhs, and con|&s;umptions
are caught in the&s;e nocturnal
pa&s;times, <HI>&s;ub dio,</HI> than from all the
ri&s;ques and accidents to which a life of
toil and danger is expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and other ob&s;ervations, which I
have made in this excur&s;ion, will &s;horten
my &s;tay at London, and &s;end me back
with a double reli&s;h to my &s;olitude and
mountains; but I &s;hall return by a diffe|rent
route from that which brought me to
town. I have &s;een &s;ome old friends, who

I talked to her in &s;uch a &s;tile of

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s LAETITIA WILLIS, at Glouce&s;ter.
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>INEXPRESSIBLE was the plea&s;ure
I received from yours of the 25th, which
was la&s;t night put into my hands by Mrs.
Brentwood, the milliner, from Glouce&s;ter
&mdash;I rejoice to hear that my worthy go|verne&s;s
is in good health, and, &s;till more,
that &s;he no longer retains any di&s;plea&s;ure
towards her poor Liddy. I am &s;orry you
have lo&s;t the &s;ociety of the agreeable mi&s;s
Vaughan; but, I hope, you won't have
cau&s;e much longer to regret the depar|ture
of your &s;chool companions, as I
make no doubt but your parents will,
in a little time, bring you into the world,
where you are &s;o well qualified to make a
di&s;tingui&s;hed figure. When that is the
ca&s;e, I flatter my&s;elf you and I &s;hall meet
again, and be happy together; and even
improve the friend&s;hip which we contract|ed
in our tender years&mdash;This at lea&s;t I
can promi&s;e&mdash;It &s;hall not be for the want
<PB N="192" REF="205">
of my utmo&s;t endeavours, if our inti|macy
does not continue for life.</P>
<P>About five days ago we arrived in Lon|don,
after an ea&s;y journey from Bath;
during which, however, we were over|turned,
and met with &s;ome other little
incidents, which had like to have occa|&s;ioned
a mi&s;under&s;tanding betwixt my un|cle
and aunt; but now, thank God, they
are happily reconciled: we live in har|mony
together, and every day make par|ties
to &s;ee the wonders of this va&s;t metro|polis,
which, however, I cannot pretend
to de&s;cribe; for I have not as yet &s;een
one hundredth part of its curio&s;ities, and
I am quite in a maze of admiration.</P>
<P>The cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter
are &s;pread out into an incredible extent.
The &s;treets, &s;quares, rows, lanes, and
alleys, are innumerable. Palaces, pub|lic
buildings, and churches, ri&s;e in every
quarter; and, among the&s;e la&s;t, St. Paul's
appears with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing pre|eminence.
They &s;ay it is not &s;o large as
St. Peter's at Rome; but, for my own
part, I can have no idea of any earthly
temple more grand and magnificent.</P>
<P>But even the&s;e &s;uperb objects are not
&s;o &s;triking as the crowds of people that
&s;warm in the &s;treets. I at fir&s;t imagined,
<PB N="193" REF="206">
that &s;ome great a&s;&s;embly was ju&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed,
and wanted to &s;tand a&s;ide till the
multitude &s;hould pa&s;s; but this human
tide continues to flow, without interrup|tion
or abatement, from morn till night.
Then there is &s;uch an infinity of gay
equipages, coaches, chariots, chai&s;es, and
other carriages, continually rolling and
&s;hifting before your eyes, that one's head
grows giddy looking at them; and the
imagination is quite confounded with
&s;plendour and variety. Nor is the pro|&s;pect
by water le&s;s grand and a&s;toni&s;hing
than that by land: you &s;ee three &s;tu|pendous
bridges, joining the oppo&s;ite
banks of a broad, deep, and rapid
river; &s;o va&s;t, &s;o &s;tately, &s;o elegant, that
they &s;eem to be the work of the giants:
betwixt them, the whole &s;urface of the
Thames is covered with &s;mall ve&s;&s;els,
barges, boats, and wherries, pa&s;&s;ing to
and fro; and below the three bridges,
&s;uch a prodigious fore&s;t of ma&s;ts, for miles
together, that you would think all the
&s;hips in the univer&s;e were here a&s;&s;embled.
All that you read of wealth and grandeur,
in the Arabian Night's Entertainment,
and the Per&s;ian Tales, concerning Bag|dad,
Diarbekir, Dama&s;cus, I&s;pahan, and
Samarkand, is here realized.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="207">
Ranelagh looks like the inchanted pa|lace
of a genie, adorned with the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite performances of painting, carv|ing,
and gilding, enlightened with a
thou&s;and golden lamps, that emulate the
noon-day &s;un; crowded with the great,
the rich, the gay, the happy, and the
fair; glittering with cloth of gold and
&s;ilver, lace, embroidery, and precious
&s;tones. While the&s;e exulting &s;ons and
daughters of felicity tread this round of
plea&s;ure, or regale in different parties,
and &s;eparate lodges, with fine imperial
tea and other delicious refre&s;hments, their
ears are entertained with the mo&s;t ravi&s;h|ing
delights of mu&s;ick, both in&s;trumen|tal
and vocal. There I heard the fa|mous
Tenducci, a thing from Italy&mdash;It
looks for all the world like a man, though
they &s;ay it is not. The voice, to be &s;ure,
is neither man's nor woman's; but it is
more melodious than either; and it war|bled
&s;o divinely, that, while I li&s;tened, I
really thought my&s;elf in paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock, in a charming moon|light
evening, we embarked at Ranelagh
for Vauxhall, in a wherry, &s;o light and
&s;lender, that we looked like &s;o many
fairies &s;ailing in a nut-&s;hell. My uncle,
being apprehen&s;ive of catching cold upon
<PB N="195" REF="208">
the water, went round in the coach, and
my aunt would have accompanied him,
but he would not &s;uffer me to go by wa|ter
if &s;he went by land; and therefore &s;he
favoured us with her company, as &s;he
perceived I had a curio&s;ity to make this
agreeable voyage&mdash;After all, the ve&s;&s;el
was &s;ufficiently loaded; for, be&s;ides the
waterman, there was my brother Jery,
and a friend of his, one Mr. Barton, a
country gentleman, of a good fortune,
who had dined at our hou&s;e&mdash;The plea|&s;ure
of this little excur&s;ion was, how|ever,
damped, by my being &s;adly fright|ed
at our landing; where there was a
terrible confu&s;ion of wherries, and a
crowd of people bawling, and &s;wearing,
and quarrelling: nay, a parcel of ugly-looking
fellows came running into the
water, and laid hold on our boat with
great violence, to pull it a-&s;hore; nor
would they quit their hold till my bro|ther
&s;truck one of them over the head
with his cane. But this flutter was fully
recompen&s;ed by the plea&s;ures of Vaux|hall;
which I no &s;ooner entered, than I
was dazzled and confounded with the va|riety
of beauties that ru&s;hed all at once
upon my eye. Image to your&s;elf, my
dear Letty, a &s;pacious garden, part laid
<PB N="196" REF="209">
out in delightful walks, bounded with
high hedges and trees, and paved with
gravel; part exhibiting a wonderful a&s;|&s;emblage
of the mo&s;t picture&s;que and
&s;triking objects, pavilions, lodges, groves,
grottoes, lawns, temples, and ca&s;cades;
porticoes, colonades, and rotundos; a|dorned
with pillars, &s;tatues, and paint|ing:
the whole illuminated with an infi|nate
number of lamps, di&s;po&s;ed in diffe|rent
figures of &s;uns, &s;tars, and con&s;tella|tions;
the place crowded with the gaye&s;t
company, ranging through tho&s;e bli&s;s|ful
&s;hades, or &s;upping in different lodges
on cold collations, enlivened with mirth,
freedom, and good-humour, and animat|ed
by an excellent band of mu&s;ick. A|mong
the vocal performers I had the
happine&s;s to hear the celebrated Mrs.

&s;hrill, that it made my head ake through
exce&s;s of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In about half an hour after we arriv|ed
we were joined by my uncle, who
did not &s;eem to reli&s;h the place. Peo|ple
of experience and infirmity, my dear
Letty, &s;ee with very different eyes from
tho&s;e that &s;uch as you and I make u&s;e
of&mdash;Our evening's entertainment was in|terrupted
by an unlucky accident. In
<PB N="197" REF="210">
one of the remote&s;t walks we were &s;ur|pri&s;ed
with a &s;udden &s;hower, that &s;et the
whole company a-running, and drove us
in heaps, one upon another, into the ro|tunda;
where my uncle, finding him&s;elf
wet, began to be very peevi&s;h and ur|gent
to be gone. My brother went to
look for the coach, and found it with
much difficulty; but as it could not hold
us all, Mr. Barton &s;tayed behind. It was
&s;ome time before the carriage could be
brought up to the gate, in the confu&s;i|on,
notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t endea|vours
of our new footman, Humphry
Clinker, who lo&s;t his &s;cratch periwig,
and got a broken head in the &s;cuffle.
The moment we were &s;eated, my aunt
pulled off my uncle's &s;hoes, and carefully
wrapped his poor feet in her capuchin;
then &s;he gave him a mouth-full of cor|dial,
which &s;he always keeps in her
pocket, and his clothes were &s;hifted as
&s;oon as we arrived at lodgings; &s;o that,
ble&s;&s;ed be God, he e&s;caped a &s;evere cold,
of which he was in great terror.</P>
<P>As for Mr. Barton, I mu&s;t tell you in
confidence, he was a little particular;
but, perhaps, I mi&s;take his complai&s;ance;
and I wi&s;h I may, for his &s;ake&mdash;You know
the condition of my poor heart; which,
<PB N="198" REF="211">
in &s;pite of hard u&s;age&mdash;And yet I ought
not to complain: nor will I, till farther
information.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Ranelagh and Vauxhall, I have
been at Mrs. Cornelys' a&s;&s;embly, which,
for the rooms, the company, the dre&s;&s;es,
and decorations, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all de&s;cription;
but as I have no great turn for card-play|ing,
I have not yet entered thoroughly
into the &s;pirit of the place: indeed I am
&s;till &s;uch a country hoyden, that I could
hardly find patience to be put in a con|dition
to appear, yet I was not above &s;ix
hours under the hands of the hair-dre&s;&s;er,
who &s;tuffed my head with as much black
wool as would have made a quilted pet|ticoat;
and, after all, it was the &s;malle&s;t
head in the a&s;&s;embly, except my aunt's&mdash;
She, to be &s;ure, was &s;o particular with
her rumpt gown and petticoat, her &s;can|ty
curls, her lappet-head, deep triple
ruffles, and high &s;tays, that every body
looked at her with &s;urpri&s;e: &s;ome whi&s;per|ed,
and &s;ome tittered; and lady Gri&s;kin,
by whom we were introduced, flatly told
her, &s;he was twenty good years behind the
fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Lady Gri&s;kin is a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, to
whom we have the honour to be related.
She keeps a &s;mall rout at her own hou&s;e,
<PB N="199" REF="212">
never exceeding ten or a dozen card-ta|bles,
but the&s;e are frequented by the
be&s;t company in town&mdash;She has been &s;o
obliging as to introduce my aunt and me
to &s;ome of her particular friends of qua|lity,
who treat us with the mo&s;t familiar
good-humour: we have once dined with
her, and &s;he takes the trouble to direct
us in all our motions. I am &s;o happy as
to have gained her good-will to &s;uch a
degree, that &s;he &s;ometimes adju&s;ts my
cap with her own hands; and &s;he has
given me a kind invitation to &s;tay with
her all the winter. This, however, has
been cruelly declined by my uncle, who
&s;eems to be (I know not how) prejudiced
again&s;t the good lady; for, whenever my
aunt happens to &s;peak in her commenda|tion,
I ob&s;erve that he makes wry faces,
though he &s;ays nothing.&mdash;Perhaps, in|deed,
the&s;e grimaces may be the effect of
pain ari&s;ing from the gout and rheuma|ti&s;m,
with which he is &s;adly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed&mdash;
To me, however, he is always good-na|tured
and generous, even beyond my
wi&s;h. Since we came hither, he has made
me a pre&s;ent of a &s;uit of clothes, with
trimmings and laces, which co&s;t more
money than I &s;hall mention; and Jery,
at his de&s;ire, has given me my mother's
<PB N="200" REF="213">
diamond drops, which are ordered to be
&s;et a-new; &s;o that it won't be his fault if
I do not glitter among the &s;tars of the
fourth or fifth magnitude. I wi&s;h my
weak head may not grow giddy in the
mid&s;t of all this gallantry and di&s;&s;ipation;
though, as yet, I can &s;afely declare, I
could gladly give up all the&s;e tumultu|ous
plea&s;ures, for country &s;olitude, and a
happy retreat with tho&s;e we love; among

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>I SEND you this letter, franked by our
old friend Barton; who is as much al|tered
as it was po&s;&s;ible for a man of his
kidney to be&mdash;In&s;tead of the carele&s;s, in|dolent
<PB N="201" REF="214">
&s;loven we knew at Oxford, I found
him a bu&s;y talkative politician; a petit|ma&icirc;tre
in his dre&s;s, and a ceremonious
courtier in his manners. He has not gall
enough in his con&s;titution to be enflamed
with the rancour of party, &s;o as to deal
in &s;currilous invectives; but, &s;ince he
obtained a place, he is become a warm
partizan of the mini&s;try, and &s;ees every
thing through &s;uch an exaggerating me|dium,
as to me, who am happily of no
party, is altogether incomprehen&s;ible&mdash;
Without all doubt, the fumes of faction
not only di&s;turb the faculty of rea&s;on, but
al&s;o pervert the organs of &s;en&s;e; and I
would lay a hundred guineas to ten, that
if Barton on one &s;ide, and the mo&s;t con|&s;cientious
patriot in the oppo&s;ition on the
other, were to draw, upon honour, the
picture of the k&mdash;or m&mdash;, you and
I, who are &s;till uninfected, and unbia&s;&s;ed,
would find both painters equally di&s;tant
from the truth. One thing, however,
mu&s;t be allowed for the honour of Bar|ton,
he never breaks out into illiberal
abu&s;e, far le&s;s endeavours, by infamous
calumnies, to bla&s;t the moral character of
any individual on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince we came hither, he has been
remarkably a&s;&s;iduous in his attention to
<PB N="202" REF="215">
our family; an attention, which, in a man
of his indolence and avocations, I &s;hould
have thought altogether odd, and even
unnatural, had not I perceived that my
&s;i&s;ter Liddy has made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion
upon his heart. I can't &s;ay that I have
any objection to his trying his fortune in
this pur&s;uit: if an opulent e&s;tate and a
great &s;tock of good-nature are &s;ufficient
qualifications in a hu&s;band, to render the
marriage-&s;tate happy for life, &s;he may be
happy with Barton; but, I imagine, there
is &s;omething el&s;e required to engage and
&s;ecure the affection of a woman of &s;en&s;e
and delicacy: &s;omething which nature
has denied our friend&mdash;Liddy &s;eems to be
of the &s;ame opinion. When he addre&s;&s;es
him&s;elf to her in di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he &s;eems to
li&s;ten with reluctance, and indu&s;triou&s;ly
avoids all particular communication; but
in proportion to her coyne&s;s, our aunt is
coming. Mrs. Tabitha goes more than
half way to meet his advances; &s;he mi&s;|takes,
or affects to mi&s;take, the meaning
of his courte&s;y, which is rather formal
and ful&s;ome; &s;he returns his compli|ments
with hyperbolical intere&s;t, &s;he per|&s;ecutes
him with her civilities at table,
&s;he appeals to him for ever in conver&s;a|tion,
&s;he &s;ighs, and flirts, and ogles,
<PB N="203" REF="216">
and by her hideous affectation and imper|tinence,
drives the poor courtier to the
very extremity of his complai&s;ance: in
&s;hort, &s;he &s;eems to have undertaken the
&s;iege of Barton's heart, and carries on her
approaches in &s;uch a de&s;perate manner,
that I don't know whether he will not be
obliged to capitulate. In the mean time,
his aver&s;ion to this inamorata &s;truggling
with his acquired affability, and his na|tural
fear of giving offence, throws him
into a kind of di&s;tre&s;s which is extreme|ly
ridiculous.</P>
<P>Two days ago, he per&s;uaded my un|cle
and me to accompany him to St.
James's, where he undertook to make us
acquainted with the per&s;ons of all the
great men in the kingdom; and, indeed,
there was a great a&s;&s;emblage of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
characters, for it was a high fe&s;|tival
at court. Our conductor performed
his promi&s;e with great punctuality. He
pointed out almo&s;t every individual of
both &s;exes, and generally introduced
them to our notice, with a flouri&s;h of pa|negyrick&mdash;Seeing
the king approach,
&startq;There comes (&s;aid he) the mo&s;t ami|able
&s;overeign that ever &s;wayed the
&s;ceptre of England; the <HI>deliciae hu|mani
generis;</HI> Augu&s;tus, in patronizing
<PB N="204" REF="217">
merit; Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian in genero&s;ity;
Trajan in beneficence; and Marcus
Aurelius, in philo&s;ophy.&endq; &startq;A very
hone&s;t kind-hearted gentleman (added
my uncle); he's too good for the
times. A king of England &s;hould have
a &s;pice of the devil in his compo&s;ition.&endq;
Barton, then turning to the duke of C&mdash;,
proceeded,&mdash;&startq;You know the duke; that
illu&s;trious hero, who trod rebellion un|der
his feet, and &s;ecured us in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of every thing we ought to hold
dear, as Engli&s;hmen and Chri&s;tians.
Mark what an eye, how penetrating,
yet pacific! what dignity in his mein!
what humanity in his a&s;pect&mdash;Even
malice mu&s;t own, that he is one of the
greate&s;t officers in Chri&s;tendom.&endq; &startq;I
think he be (&s;aid Mr. Bramble); but
who are the&s;e young gentlemen that
&s;tand be&s;ide him?&endq; &startq;Tho&s;e! (cried
our friend) tho&s;e are his royal nephews;
the princes of the blood. Sweet young
princes! the &s;acred pledges of the
Prote&s;tant line; &s;o &s;pirited, &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble,
&s;o princely&mdash;&endq; &startq;Yes; very &s;en|&s;ible!
very &s;pirited! (&s;aid my uncle,
interrupting him) but &s;ee the queen!
ha, there's the queen!&mdash;There's the
queen! let me &s;ee&mdash;Let me &s;ee&mdash;
<PB N="205" REF="218">
Where are my gla&s;&s;es? ha! there's
meaning in that eye&mdash;There's &s;enti|ment&mdash;
There's expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;Well, Mr.
Barton, what figure do you call next?&endq;
The next per&s;on he pointed out, was the
favourite <HI>yearl;</HI> who &s;tood &s;olitary by one
of the windows&mdash;&startq;Behold yon northern
&s;tar, (&s;aid he) <HI>&s;horn of his beams</HI>&mdash;&endq;
&startq;What! the Caledonian luminary, that
lately blazed &s;o bright in our hemi&s;|phere!
methinks, at pre&s;ent, it glim|mers
through a fog; like Saturn with|out
his ring, bleak, and dim, and
di&s;tant&mdash;Ha, there's the other great
phoenomenon, the grand pen&s;ionary,
that weather-cock of patrioti&s;m that
veers about in every point of the poli|tical
compa&s;s, and &s;till feels the wind
of popularity in his tail. He too, like
a portentous comet, has ri&s;en again a|bove
the court-horizon; but how long
he will continue to a&s;cend, it is not
ea&s;y to foretel, con&s;idering his great
eccentricity&mdash;Who are tho&s;e two &s;atel|lites
that attend his motions?&endq; When
Barton told him their names, &startq;To their
characters (&s;aid Mr. Bramble) I am no
&s;tranger. One of them, without a drop
of red blood in his veins, has a cold
intoxicating vapour in his head; and
<PB N="206" REF="219">
rancour enough in his heart to inocu|late
and affect a whole nation. The
other is (I hear) intended for a &s;hare in
the ad&mdash;n, and the pen&s;ionary
vouches for his being duly qualified&mdash;
The only in&s;tance I ever heard of his
&s;agacity, was his de&s;erting his former
patron, when he found him declining
in power, and in di&s;grace with the
people. Without principle, talent, or
intelligence, he is ungracious as a
hog, greedy as a vulture, and thievi&s;h
as a jackdaw; but, it mu&s;t be owned,
he is no hypocrite. He pretends to no
virtue, and takes no pains to di&s;gui&s;e
his character&mdash;His mini&s;try will be at|tended
with one advantage, no man
will be di&s;appointed by his breach of
promi&s;e, as no mortal ever tru&s;ted to
his word. I wonder how lord&mdash;
fir&s;t di&s;covered this happy genius, and
for what purpo&s;e lord&mdash;has now
adopted him: but one would think,
that as amber has a power to attract
dirt, and &s;traws, and chaff, a mini&s;ter
is endued with the &s;ame kind of facul|ty,
to <HI>lick up every knave and blockhead
in his way</HI>&mdash;&endq; His elogium was inter|rupted
by the arrival of the old duke of
N&mdash;; who, &s;queezing into the circle
<PB N="207" REF="220">
with a bu&s;y face of importance, thru&s;t
his head into every countenance, as if he
had been in &s;earch of &s;omebody, to whom
he wanted to impart &s;omething of great
con&s;equence&mdash;My uncle, who had been
formerly known to him, bowed as he
pa&s;&s;ed; and the duke, &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;a|luted
&s;o re&s;pectfully by a well-dre&s;&s;ed
per&s;on, was not &s;low in returning the
courte&s;y&mdash;He even came up, and, tak|ing
him cordially by the hand, &startq;My
dear friend, Mr. A&mdash;, (&s;aid he) I am
rejoiced to &s;ee you&mdash;How long have
you been come from abroad?&mdash;How
did you leave our good friends, the
Dutch? The king of Pru&s;&s;ia don't
think of another war, ah?&mdash;He's a
great king! a great conqueror! a very
great conqueror! Your Alexanders
and Hannibals were nothing at all to
him, &s;ir&mdash;Corporals! drummers!
dro&s;s! mere tra&s;h&mdash;Damned tra&s;h,
heh?&mdash;&endq; His grace being by this time
out of breath, my uncle took the oppor|tunity
to tell him he had not been out
of England, that his name was Bram|ble,
and that he had the honour to &s;it
in the la&s;t parliament but one of the late
king, as repre&s;entative for the borough
of Dymkymraig. &startq;Od&s;o! (cried the
<PB N="208" REF="221">
duke) I remember you perfectly well,
my dear Mr. Bramble&mdash;You was al|ways
a good and loyal &s;ubject&mdash;a
&s;taunch friend to admini&s;tration&mdash;I
made your brother an Iri&s;h bi&s;hop&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Pardon me, my lord (&s;aid the '&s;quire)
I once had a brother, but he was a
captain in the army&mdash;&endq; &startq;Ha! (&s;aid
his grace) he was &s;o&mdash;He was, indeed!
But who was the bi&s;hop then? Bi&s;hop
Blackberry&mdash;Sure it was bi&s;hop
Blackberry&mdash;Perhaps &s;ome relation of
yours&mdash;&endq; &startq;Very likely, my lord
(replied my uncle); the Blackberry is
the fruit of the Bramble&mdash;But, I be|lieve,
the bi&s;hop is not a berry of our
bu&s;h&mdash;&endq; &startq;No more he is&mdash;No more
he is, ha, ha, ha! (exclaimed the duke)
there you gave me a &s;cratch, good Mr.
Bramble, ha, ha, ha!&mdash;Well, I &s;hall
be glad to &s;ee you at Lincoln's-inn|fields&mdash;You
know the way&mdash;Times
are altered. Though I have lo&s;t the
power, I retain the inclination&mdash;Your
very humble &s;ervant, good Mr. Black|berry&mdash;&endq;
So &s;aying, he &s;hoved to
another corner of the room. &startq;What a
fine old gentleman! (cried Mr. Bar|ton)
what &s;pirits! what a memory!&mdash;
He never forgets an old friend.&endq; &startq;He
<PB N="209" REF="222">
does me too much honour, (ob&s;erved
our '&s;quire) to rank me among the
number&mdash;Whil&s;t I &s;at in parliament, I
never voted with the mini&s;try but three
times, when my con&s;cience told me
they were in the right: however, if he
&s;till keeps levee, I will carry my
nephew thither, that he may &s;ee, and
learn to avoid the &s;cene; for, I think,
an Engli&s;h gentleman never appears to
&s;uch di&s;advantage, as at the levee of
a mini&s;ter&mdash;Of his grace I &s;hall &s;ay no|thing
at pre&s;ent, but that for thirty
years he was the con&s;tant and common
butt of ridicule and execration. He
was generally laughed at as an ape in
politics, who&s;e office and influence
&s;erved only to render his folly the more
notorious; and the oppo&s;ition cur&s;ed
him, as the indefatigable drudge of a
fir&s;t-mover, who was ju&s;tly &s;tiled and
&s;tigmatized as the father of corruption:
but this ridiculous ape, this venal
drudge, no &s;ooner lo&s;t the places he
was &s;o ill qualified to fill, and unfurl|ed
the banners of faction, than he was
metamorpho&s;ed into a pattern of pub|lic
virtue; the very people who revil|ed
him before, now extolled him to
the &s;kies, as a wi&s;e, experienced &s;tate&s;|man,
<PB N="210" REF="223">
chief pillar of the Prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
and corner &s;tone of Engli&s;h
liberty. I &s;hould be glad to know how
Mr. Barton reconciles the&s;e contradic|tions,
without obliging us to re&s;ign all
title to the privilege of common &s;en&s;e.&endq;
&startq;My dear &s;ir, (an&s;wered Barton) I don't
pretend to ju&s;tify the extravagations of
the multitude; who, I &s;uppo&s;e, were
as wild in their former cen&s;ure, as in
their pre&s;ent prai&s;e: but I &s;hall be very
glad to attend you on Thur&s;day next
to his grace's levee; where, I'm afraid,
we &s;hall not be crowded with com|pany;
for, you know, there's a wide
difference between his pre&s;ent office of
pre&s;ident of the council, and his for|mer
po&s;t of fir&s;t lord commi&s;&s;ioner of
the trea&s;ury.&endq;</P>
<P>This communicative friend having an|nounced
all the remarkable characters of
both &s;exes, that appeared at court, we
re&s;olved to adjourn, and retired. At the
foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, there was a crowd of
laqueys and chairmen, and in the mid&s;t of
them &s;tood Humphry Clinker, exalted
upon a &s;tool, with his hat in one hand,
and a paper in the other, in the act of
holding forth to the people&mdash;Before we
could inquire into the meaning of this ex|hibition,
<PB N="211" REF="224">
he perceived his ma&s;ter, thru&s;t
the paper into his pocket, de&s;cended from
his elevation, bolted through the crowd,
and brought up the carriage to the
gate.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;aid nothing till we were
&s;eated, when, after having looked at me ear|ne&s;tly
for &s;ome time, he bur&s;t out a-laugh|ing,
and a&s;ked if I knew upon what &s;ub|ject
Clinker was holding forth to the mob
&mdash;&startq;If (&s;aid he) the fellow is turned
mountebank, I mu&s;t turn him out of
my &s;ervice, otherwi&s;e he'll make Mer|ry
Andrews of us all&mdash;&endq; I ob&s;erved,
that, in all probability, he had &s;tudied
medicine under his ma&s;ter, who was a
farrier.&mdash;</P>
<P>At dinner, the '&s;quire a&s;ked him, if he
had ever practi&s;ed phy&s;ic? &startq;Yes, an
plea&s;e your honour, (&s;aid he) among
brute bea&s;ts; but I never meddle with
rational creatures.&endq; &startq;I know not
whether you rank in that cla&s;s the au|dience
you was harranguing in the
court at St. James's, but I &s;hould be
glad to know what kind of powders
you was di&s;tributing; and whether
you had a good &s;ale&mdash;&endq; &startq;Sale, &s;ir!
(cried Clinker) I hope I &s;hall never be
ba&s;e enough to &s;ell for gold and &s;ilver,
<PB N="212" REF="225">
what freely comes of God's grace. I
di&s;tributed nothing, an like your ho|nour,
but a word of advice to my fel|lows
in &s;ervitude and &s;in.&endq; &startq;Ad|vice!
concerning what?&endq; &startq;Concern|ing
profane &s;wearing, an plea&s;e your
honour; &s;o horrid and &s;hocking, that
it made my hair &s;tand on end.&endq; &startq;Nay,
if thou can'&s;t cure them of that di&s;ea&s;e,
I &s;hall think thee a wonderful doctor
indeed&mdash;&endq; &startq;Why not cure them,
my good ma&s;ter? the hearts of tho&s;e
poor people are not &s;o &s;tubborn as your
honour &s;eems to think&mdash;Make them
fir&s;t &s;en&s;ible that you have nothing in
view but their good, then they will
li&s;ten with patience, and ea&s;ily be con|vinced
of the &s;in and folly of a practice
that affords neither profit not plea|&s;ure&mdash;&endq;
At this remark, our uncle
changed colour, and looked round the
company, con&s;cious that his <HI>own withers
were not altogether unwrung.</HI> &startq;But, Clin|ker,
(&s;aid he) if you &s;hould have elo|quence
enough to per&s;uade the vulgar,
to re&s;ign tho&s;e tropes and figures of
rhetoric, there will be little or nothing
left to di&s;tingui&s;h their conver&s;ation
from that of their betters.&endq; &startq;But
then your honour knows, their conver|&s;ation
<PB N="213" REF="226">
will be void of offence; and, at
the day of judgment, there will be no
di&s;tinction of per&s;ons.&endq;</P>
<P>Humphry going down &s;tairs to fetch
up a bottle of wine, my uncle congratu|lated
his &s;i&s;ter upon having &s;uch a refor|mer
in the family; when Mrs. Tabitha
declared, he was a &s;ober civilized fellow;
very re&s;pectful, and very indu&s;trious;
and, &s;he believed, a good Chri&s;tian into
the bargain. One would think, Clinker
mu&s;t really have &s;ome very extraordinary
talent, to ingratiate him&s;elf in this man|ner
with a virago of her character, &s;o for|tified
again&s;t him with prejudice and re|&s;entment;
but the truth is, &s;ince the ad|venture
of Salt-hill, Mrs. Tabby &s;eems
to be entirely changed. She has left off
&s;colding the &s;ervants, an exerci&s;e which
was grown habitual, and even &s;eemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to her con&s;titution; and is be|come

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>YES, Doctor, I have &s;een the Briti&s;h
Mu&s;eum; which is a noble collection,
and even &s;tupendous, if we con&s;ider it
was made by a private man, a phy&s;ician,
who was obliged to make his own fortune
at the &s;ame time: but great as the collec|tion
is, it would appear more &s;triking if
it was arranged in one &s;pacious &s;aloon,
in&s;tead of being divided into different a|partments,
which it does not entirely fill&mdash;
I could wi&s;h the &s;eries of medals was con|nected,
and the whole of the animal, ve|getable,
and mineral kingdoms complet|ed,
by adding to each, at the public ex|pence,
tho&s;e articles that are wanting.
It would likewi&s;e be a great improve|ment,
with re&s;pect to the library, if the
deficiencies were made up, by purcha&s;ing
all the books of character that are not to
be found already in the collection&mdash;They
might be cla&s;&s;ed in centuries, according
to the dates of their publication, and ca|talogues
<PB N="216" REF="229">
printed of them and the manu|&s;cripts,
for the information of tho&s;e that
want to con&s;ult, or compile from &s;uch
authorities. I could al&s;o wi&s;h, for the
honour of the nation, that there was a
complete apparatus for a cour&s;e of mathe|matics,
mechanics, and experimental
philo&s;ophy; and a good &s;alary &s;ettled up|on
an able profe&s;&s;or, who &s;hould give re|gular
lectures on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But this is all idle &s;peculation, which
will never be reduced to practice&mdash;Con|&s;idering
the temper of the times, it is a
wonder to &s;ee any in&s;titution what&s;oever
e&s;tabli&s;hed, for the benefit of the public.
The &s;pirit of party is ri&s;en to a kind of
phrenzy, unknown to former ages, or
rather degenerated to a total extinction of
hone&s;ty and candour&mdash;You know I have
ob&s;erved, for &s;ome time, that the public
papers are become the infamous vehicles
of the mo&s;t cruel and perfidious defama|tion:
every rancorous knave&mdash;every
de&s;perate incendiary, that can afford to
&s;pend half a crown or three &s;hillings,
may &s;kulk behind the pre&s;s of a news|monger,
and have a &s;tab at the fir&s;t cha|racter
in the kingdom, without running
the lea&s;t hazard of detection or puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="230">
I have made acquaintance with a Mr.
Barton, whom Jery knew at Oxford; a
good &s;ort of a man, though mo&s;t ridicu|lou&s;ly
warped in his political principles;
but his partiality is the le&s;s offen&s;ive, as it
never appears in the &s;tile of &s;currility and
abu&s;e. He is a member of parliament,
and a retainer to the court; and his whole
conver&s;ation turns upon the virtues and
perfections of the mini&s;ters, who are his
patrons. T'other day, when he was be|daubing
one of tho&s;e worthies, with the
mo&s;t ful&s;ome prai&s;e, I told him I had
&s;een the &s;ame nobleman characteri&s;ed ve|ry
differently, in one of the daily-papers;
indeed, &s;o &s;tigmatized, that if one half
of what was &s;aid of him was true, he
mu&s;t be not only unfit to rule, but even
unfit to live: that tho&s;e impeachments
had been repeated again and again, with
the addition of fre&s;h matter; and that as
he had taken no &s;teps towards his own
vindication, I began to think there was
&s;ome foundation for the charge. &startq;And
pray, &s;ir, (&s;aid Mr. Barton) what &s;teps
would you have him take?&mdash;Suppo&s;e
he &s;hould pro&s;ecute the publi&s;her, who
&s;creens the anonymous accu&s;er, and
bring him to the pillory for a libel;
this is &s;o far from being counted a
<PB N="218" REF="231">
puni&s;hment, <HI>in terrorem,</HI> that it will
probably make his fortune. The mul|titude
immediately take him into their
protection, as a martyr to the cau&s;e of
defamation, which they have always
e&s;pou&s;ed&mdash;They pay his fine, they
contribute to the increa&s;e of his &s;tock,
his &s;hop is crowded with cu&s;tomers,
and the &s;ale of his paper ri&s;es in pro|portion
to the &s;candal it contains. All
this time the pro&s;ecutor is inveighed
again&s;t as a tyrant and oppre&s;&s;or, for
having cho&s;en to proceed by the way
of information, which is deemed a
grievance; but if he lays an action for
damages, he mu&s;t prove the damage,
and I leave you to judge, whether a
gentleman's character may not be
brought into contempt, and all his
views in life bla&s;ted by calumny, with|out
his being able to &s;pecify the par|ticulars
of the damage he has &s;u&s;|tained.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This &s;pirit of defamation is a kind
of here&s;y, that thrives under per&s;ecu|tion.
<HI>The liberty of the pre&s;s</HI> is a term
of great efficacy; and, like that of <HI>the
Prote&s;tant religion,</HI> has often &s;erved the
purpo&s;es of &s;edition&mdash;A mini&s;ter, there|fore,
mu&s;t arm him&s;elf with patience,
<PB N="219" REF="232">
and bear tho&s;e attacks without repin|ing&mdash;Whatever
mi&s;chief they may do
in other re&s;pects, they certainly con|tribute,
in one particular, to the ad|vantage
of government; for tho&s;e de|famatory
articles have multiplied pa|pers
in &s;uch a manner, and augment|ed
their &s;ale to &s;uch a degree, that the
duty upon &s;tamps and adverti&s;ements
has made a very con&s;iderable addition
to the revenue.&endq; Certain it is, a gen|tleman's
honour is a very delicate &s;ubject
to be handled by a jury, compo&s;ed of
men, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed remark|able
either for &s;entiment or impartiality
&mdash;In &s;uch a ca&s;e, indeed, the defendant
is tried, not only by his peers, but al&s;o
by his party; and I really think, that of all
patriots, he is the mo&s;t re&s;olute who ex|po&s;es
him&s;elf to &s;uch detraction, for the
&s;ake of his country&mdash;If, from the igno|rance
or partiality of juries, a gentleman
can have no redre&s;s from law, for being
defamed in a pamphlet or news-paper, I
know but one other method of proceed|ing
again&s;t the publi&s;her, which is at|tended
with &s;ome ri&s;que, but has been
practi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully, more than once, in
my remembrance&mdash;A regiment of hor&s;e
was repre&s;ented, in one of the news-pa|pers,
<PB N="220" REF="233">
as having mi&s;behaved at Dettin|gen;
a captain of that regiment broke
the publi&s;her's bones, telling him, at the
&s;ame time, if he went to law, he &s;hould
certainly have the like &s;alutation from
every officer of the corps. Governor
&mdash;took the &s;ame &s;atisfaction on the
ribs of an author, who traduced him by
name in a periodical paper&mdash;I know a
low fellow of the &s;ame cla&s;s, who, being
turned out of Venice for his impudence
and &s;currility, retired to Lugano, a town
of the Gri&s;ons, (a free people, God wot)
where he found a printing pre&s;s, from
whence he &s;quirted his filth at &s;ome re|&s;pectable
characters in the republic, which
he had been obliged to abandon. Some
of the&s;e, finding him out of the reach of
legal cha&s;ti&s;ement, employed certain u&s;e|ful
in&s;truments, &s;uch as may be found in
all countries, to give him the ba&s;tinado;
which, being repeated more than once,
effectually &s;topt the current of his abu&s;e.</P>
<P>As for the liberty of the pre&s;s, like
every other privilege, it mu&s;t be re&s;train|ed
within certain bounds; for if it is
carried to a breach of law, religion, and
charity, it becomes one of the greate&s;t
evils that ever annoyed the community.
If the lowe&s;t ruffian may &s;tab your good-name
<PB N="221" REF="234">
with impunity in England, will
you be &s;o uncandid as to exclaim again&s;t
Italy for the practice of common a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination?
To what purpo&s;e is our proper|ty
&s;ecured, if our moral character is le$t
de&s;encele&s;s? People thus baited, grow
de&s;perate; and the de&s;pair of being able
to pre&s;erve one's character, untainted by
&s;uch vermin, produces a total neglect of
fame; &s;o that one of the chief incite|ments
to the practice of virtue is effec|tually
de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Mr. Barton's la&s;t con&s;ideration, re&s;pect|ing
the &s;tamp-duty, is equally wi&s;e and
laudable with another maxim which has
been long adopted by our financiers,
namely, to connive at drunkenne&s;s, riot,
and di&s;&s;ipation, becau&s;e they inhance the
receipt of the exci&s;e; not reflecting, that
in providing this temporary convenience,
they are de&s;troying the morals, health,
and indu&s;try of the people&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding
my contempt for tho&s;e who flat|ter
a mini&s;ter, I think there is &s;omething
&s;till more de$$icable in &s;lattering a mob.
When I &s;ee a man of birth, education,
and fortune, put him&s;elf on a level with
the dregs of the people, mingle with low
mechanics, $$ed with them at the &s;ame
board, and drink with them in the &s;ame
<PB N="222" REF="235">
cup, flatter their prejudices, harangue
in prai&s;e of their virtues, expo&s;e them|&s;elves
to the belchings of their beer, the
fumes of their tobacco, the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of
their familiarity, and the impertinence of
their conver&s;ation, I cannot help de&s;pi&s;|ing
him&punc; as a man guilty of the vile&s;t
pro&s;titution, in order to effect a purpo&s;e
equally &s;elfi&s;h and illiberal.</P>
<P>I &s;hould renounce politics the more
willingly, if I could find other topics of
conver&s;ation di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with more mode&s;ty
and candour; but the daemon of party
&s;eems to have u&s;urped every department
of life. Even the world of literature and
ta&s;te is divided into the mo&s;t virulent
factions, which revile, decry, and tra|duce
the works of one another. Ye&s;ter|day,
I went to return an afternoon's vi&s;it
to a gentleman of my acquaintance, at
who&s;e hou&s;e I found one of the authors
of the pre&s;ent age, who has written with
&s;ome &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;As I had read one or two
of his performances, which gave me plea|&s;ure,
I was glad of this opportunity to
know his per&s;on; but his di&s;cour&s;e and
deportment de&s;troyed all the impre&s;&s;ions
which his writings had made in his fa|vour.
He took upon him to decide dog|matically
upon every &s;ubject, without
<PB N="223" REF="236">
deigning to &s;hew the lea&s;t cau&s;e for his
differing from the general opinions of
mankind, as if it had been our duty to
acquie&s;e in the <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> of this new Py|thagoras.
He rejudged the characters of
all the principal authors, who had died
within a century of the pre&s;ent time;
and, in this revi&s;ion, paid no &s;ort of re|gard
to the reputation they had acquired
&mdash;Milton was har&s;h and pro&s;aic; Dry|den,
languid and verbo&s;e; Butler and
Swift, without humour; Congreve, with|out
wit; and Pope de&s;titute of any &s;ort
of poetical merit&mdash;As for his cotempora|ries,
he could not bear to hear one of
them mentioned with any degree of ap|plau&s;e&mdash;They
were all dunces, pedants,
plagiaries, quacks, and impo&s;tors; and
you could not name a &s;ingle performance,
but what was tame, &s;tupid, and in&s;ipid.
It mu&s;t be owned, that this writer had
nothing to charge his con&s;cience with, on
the &s;ide of flattery; for, I under&s;tand, he
was never known to prai&s;e one line that
was written, even by tho&s;e with whom he
lived on terms of good-fellow&s;hip. This
arrogance and pre&s;umption, in depreciat|ing
authors, for who&s;e reputation the
company may be intere&s;ted, is &s;uch an
<PB N="224" REF="237">
in&s;ult upon the under&s;tanding, as I could
not bear without wincing.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired to know his rea&s;ons for de|crying
&s;ome works, which had afforded
me uncommon plea&s;ure; and, as demon|&s;tration
did not &s;eem to be his talent, I
di&s;&s;ented from his opinion with great free|dom.
Having been &s;poiled by the defe|rence
and humility of his hearers, he did
not bear contradiction with much tem|per;
and the di&s;pute might have grown
warm, had it not been interrupted by
the entrance of a rival bard, at who&s;e ap|pearance
he always quits the place&mdash;
They are of different cabals, and have been
at open war the&s;e twenty years&mdash;If the
other was dogmatical, this genius was de|clamatory:
he did not di&s;cour&s;e, but ha|rangue;
and his orations were equally te|dious
and turgid. He too pronounces <HI>ex
cathedra</HI> upon the characters of his co|temporaries;
and though he &s;cruples not
to deal out prai&s;e, even lavi&s;hly, to the
lowe&s;t reptile in Grub &s;treet who will
either flatter him in private, or mount
the public ro&s;trum as his panegyri&s;t, he
damns all the other writers of the age,
with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence and rancour&mdash;
One is a blunderbu&s;s, as being a native
of Ireland; another, a half-&s;tarved lou&s;e
<PB N="225" REF="238">
of literature, from the banks of the
Tweed; a third, an a&s;s, becau&s;e he en|joys
a pen&s;ion from the government; a
fourth, the very angel of dulne&s;s; be|cau&s;e
he &s;ucceeded in a &s;pecies of writ|ing
in which this Ari&s;tarchus had fail|ed;
a fifth, who pre&s;umed to make &s;tric|tures
upon one of his performances, he
holds as a bug in critici&s;m, who&s;e &s;tench
is more offen&s;ive than his &s;ting&mdash;In &s;hort,
except him&s;elf and his myrmidons, there
is not a man of genius or learning in the
three kingdoms. As for the &s;ucce&s;s of
tho&s;e, who have written without the pale
of this confederacy, he imputes it entire|ly
to want of ta&s;te in the public; not
con&s;idering, that to the approbation of
that very ta&s;tele&s;s public, he him&s;elf owes
all the con&s;equence he has in life.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e originals are not fit for conver|&s;ation.
If they would maintain the ad|vantage
they have gained by their writ|ing,
they &s;hould never appear but up|on
paper&mdash;For my part, I am &s;hocked
to find a man have &s;ublime ideas in his
head, and nothing but illiberal &s;enti|ments
in his heart&mdash;The human &s;oul will
be generally found mo&s;t defective in the
article of candour&mdash;I am inclined to think,
no mind was ever wholly exempt from
<PB N="226" REF="239">
envy; which, perhaps, may have been
implanted, as an in&s;tinct e&s;&s;ential to our
nature. I am afraid we &s;ometimes pal|liate
this vice, under the &s;pecious name
of emulation. I have known a per&s;on re|markably
generous, humane, moderate,
and apparently &s;elf-denying, who could
not hear even a friend commended,
without betraying marks of unea&s;ine&s;s; as
if that commendation had implied an
odious compari&s;on to his prejudice, and
every wreath of prai&s;e added to the
other's character, was a garland plucked
from his own temples. This is a ma|lignant
&s;pecies of jealou&s;y, of which I
&s;tand acquitted in my own con&s;cience&mdash;
Whether it is a vice, or an infirmity, I
leave you to inquire.</P>
<P>There is another point, which I would
much rather &s;ee determined; whether
the world was always as contemptible, as
it appears to me at pre&s;ent?&mdash;If the mo|rals
of mankind have not contracted an
extraordinary degree of depravity, with|in
the&s;e thirty years, then mu&s;t I be in|fected
with the common vice of old men,
<HI>difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti;</HI>
or, which is more probable, the impetu|ous
pur&s;uits and avocations of youth have
formerly hindered me from ob&s;erving
<PB N="227" REF="240">
tho&s;e rotten parts of human nature, which
now appear &s;o offen&s;ively to my ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>We have been at court, and 'change,
and every where; and every where we
find food for &s;pleen, and &s;ubject for ri|dicule&mdash;My
new &s;ervant, Humphry Clin|ker,
turns out a great original; and
Tabby is a changed creature&mdash;She has
parted with Chowder; and does nothing
but &s;mile, like Malvolio in the play&mdash;
I'll be hanged if &s;he is not acting a part
which is not natural to her di&s;po&s;ition,
for &s;ome purpo&s;e which I have not yet
di&s;covered.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the characters of man|kind,
my curio&s;ity is quite &s;atisfied: I
have done with the &s;cience of men, and
mu&s;t now endeavour to amu&s;e my&s;elf with

I tho't it was all inchantment; and, be|lieving
my&s;elf bewitched, began for to

Wales fly upon broom-&s;ticks; but here
was flying without any broom-&s;tick, or
thing in the var&s;al world, and firing of
pi&s;tols in the air, and blowing of trum|pets,
and &s;winging, and rolling of wheel|barrows

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>I MENTIONED in my la&s;t, my un|cle's
de&s;ign of going to the duke of
N&mdash;'s levee; which de&s;ign has been
executed accordingly. His grace has
been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to this kind of
homage, that though the place he now
fills does not imply the tenth part of the
influence, which he exerted in his former
office, he has given his friends to under|&s;tand,
that they cannot oblige him in any
thing more, than in contributing to &s;up|port
the &s;hadow of that power, which he
<PB N="234" REF="247">
no longer retains in &s;ub&s;tance; and there|fore
he has &s;till public days, on which
they appear at his levee.</P>
<P>My uncle and I went thither with Mr.
Barton, who, being one of the duke's
adherents, undertook to be our intro|ducer&mdash;
The room was pretty well filled
with people, in a great variety of dre&s;s;
but there was no more than one gown
and ca&s;&s;ock, though I was told his grace
had, while he was mini&s;ter, preferred al|mo&s;t
every individual that now filled the
bench of bi&s;hops in the hou&s;e of lords;
but, in all probability, the gratitude of
the clergy is like their charity, which
&s;huns the light&mdash;Mr. Barton was imme|diately
acco&s;ted by a per&s;on, well &s;tricken
in years, tall, and raw-boned, with a
hook-no&s;e, and an arch leer, that indi|cated,
at lea&s;t, as much cunning as &s;a|gacity.
Our conductor &s;aluted him, by
the name of captain C&mdash;, and after|wards
informed us he was a man of &s;hrewd
parts, whom the government occa&s;ion|ally
employed in &s;ecret &s;ervices&mdash;But I
have had the hi&s;tory of him more at large,
from another quarter&mdash;He had been,
many years ago, concerned in fraudulent
practices, as a merchant, in France; and
being convicted of &s;ome of them, was &s;ent
<PB N="235" REF="248">
to the gallies, from whence he was de|livered
by the intere&s;t of the late duke of
Ormond, to whom he had recommended
him&s;elf in letter, as his name-&s;ake and re|lation&mdash;He
was in the &s;equel, employed
by our mini&s;try as a &s;py; and in the war
of 1740, traver&s;ed all Spain, as well as
France, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a capuchin, at
the extreme hazard of his life, in as much
as the court of Madrid had actually got
&s;cent of him, and given orders to appre|hend
him at St. Seba&s;tian's, from whence
he had fortunately retired but a few
hours before the order arrived. This
and other hair-breadth '&s;capes he pleaded
&s;o effectually as a merit with the Engli&s;h
mini&s;try, that they allowed him a com|fortable
pen&s;ion, which he now enjoys in
his old age&mdash;He has &s;till acce&s;s to all the
mini&s;ters, and is &s;aid to be con&s;ulted by
them on many &s;ubjects, as a man of un|common
under&s;tanding and great expe|rience&mdash;He
is, in fact, a fellow of &s;ome
parts, and invincible a&s;&s;urance; and, in
his di&s;cour&s;e, he a&s;&s;umes &s;uch an air of
&s;elf-&s;ufficiency, as may very well impo&s;e
upon &s;ome of the &s;hallow politicians, who
now labour at the helm of admini&s;tration.
But, if he is not belied, this is not the
only impo&s;ture of which he is guilty&mdash;
<PB N="236" REF="249">
They &s;ay, he is at bottom not only a
Roman-catholic, but really a prie&s;t; and
while he pretends to di&s;clo&s;e to our &s;tate-pilots
all the &s;prings that move the ca|binet
of Ver&s;ailles, he is actually picking
up intelligence for the &s;ervice of the
French mini&s;ter&mdash;Be that as it may,
captain C&mdash;entered into conver&s;ation
with us in the mo&s;t familiar manner, and
treated the duke's character without any
ceremony&mdash;&startq;This wi&s;e-acre (&s;aid he) is
&s;till a-bed; and, I think, the be&s;t thing
he can do, is to &s;leep on till Chri&s;t|mas;
for, when he gets up, he does
nothing but expo&s;e his own folly.&mdash;
Since Granville was turned out, there
has been no mini&s;ter in this nation
worth the meal that whitened his peri|wig&mdash;They
are &s;o ignorant, they &s;carce
know a crab from a cauliflower; and
then they are &s;uch dunces, that there's
no making them comprehend the plain|e&s;t
propo&s;ition&mdash;In the beginning of
the war, this poor half-witted creature
told me, in a great fright, that thirty
thou&s;and French had marched from
Acadie to Cape Breton&mdash;Where did
they find tran&s;ports?&endq; (&s;aid I) &startq;Tran|&s;ports!
(cried he) I tell you, they
marched by land&mdash;&endq; By land to the
<PB N="237" REF="250">
i&s;land of Cape Breton? &startq;What! is
Cape Breton an i&s;land?&endq; Certainly.
&startq;Ha! are you &s;ure of that?&endq; When I
pointed it out in the map, he examined
it earne&s;tly with his &s;pectacles; then,
taking me in his arms, &startq;My dear
C&mdash;! (cried he) you always bring us
good news&mdash;Egad! I'll go directly, and
tell the king that Cape Breton is an
i&s;land&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to entertain us with
more anecdotes of this nature, at the ex|pence
of his grace, when he was inter|rupted
by the arrival of the Algerine am|ba&s;&s;ador;
a venerable Turk&punc; with a long
white beard, attended by his dragoman,
or interpreter, and another officer of his
hou&s;ehold, who had got no &s;tockings to
his legs&mdash;Captain C&mdash;immediately
&s;poke with an air of authority to a &s;er|vant
in waiting, bidding him go and tell
the duke to ri&s;e, as the$e was a great deal
of company come, and, among others,
the amba&s;&s;ador from Algiers&punc; Then,
turning to us, &startq;$his poor Turk. (&s;aid
he) notwith&s;tanding his grey beard, is
a green-horn&mdash;He has been &s;everal
years re&s;ident in London, and &s;till is
ignorant of our political revolutions.
This vi&s;it is intended for the prime mi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="238" REF="251">
of England; but you'll &s;ee how
this wi&s;e duke will receive it as a mark
of attachment to his own per&s;on&mdash;&endq;
Certain it is, the duke &s;eemed eager to
acknowledge the compliment&mdash;A door
opening, he &s;uddenly bolted out, with a
&s;having-cloth under his chin, his face
frothed up to the eyes with &s;oap lather;
and, running up to the amba&s;&s;ador, grin|ned
hideous in his face&mdash;&startq;My dear Ma|homet!
(&s;aid he) God love your long
beard, I hope the dey will make you a
hor&s;e-tail at the next promotion, ha,
ha, ha!&mdash;Have but a moment's pa|tience,
and I'll &s;end to you in a twink|ling&mdash;&endq;
So &s;aying, he retreated into
his den, leaving the Turk in &s;ome confu|&s;ion.
After a &s;hort pau&s;e, however, he
&s;aid &s;omething to his interpreter, the
meaning of which I had great curio&s;ity
to know, as he turned up his eyes while
he &s;poke, expre&s;&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, mixed
with devotion&mdash;We were gratified by
means of the communicative captain
C&mdash;, who conver&s;ed with the drago|man,
as an old acquaintance. Ibrahim,
the amba&s;&s;ador, who had mi&s;taken his
grace for the mini&s;ter's fool, was no
&s;ooner undeceived by the interpreter, than
he exclaimed to this effect&mdash;&startq;Holy
<PB N="239" REF="252">
prophet! I don't wonder that this na|tion
pro&s;pers, &s;eeing it is governed by
the coun&s;el of ideots; a &s;eries of men,
whom all good mu&s;&s;ulmen revere as the
organs of immediate in&s;piration!&endq;
Ibrahim was favoured with a particular
audience of &s;hort duration; after which
the duke conducted him to the door, and
then returned to diffu&s;e his gracious looks
among the crowd of his wor&s;hippers.</P>
<P>As Mr. Barton advanced to pre&s;ent me
to his grace, it was my fortune to attract
his notice, before I was announced&mdash;He
forthwith met me more than half way,
and, &s;eizing me by the hand, &startq;My dear
&s;ir Francis! (cried he) this is &s;o kind&mdash;
I vow to Gad! I am &s;o obliged&mdash;Such
attention to a poor broken mini&s;ter&mdash;
Well&mdash;Pray when does your excellency
&s;et &s;ail?&mdash;For God's &s;ake have a care
of your health, and eat &s;tewed prunes
in the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;Next to your own pre|cious
health, pray, my dear excellency,
take care of the Five Nations&mdash;Our good
friends the Five Nations&mdash;The Toryro|ries,
the Maccolmacks, the Out-o'the-ways,
the Crickets, and the Kick&s;haws
&mdash;Let 'em have plenty of blankets, and
&s;tinkubus, and wampum; and your
excellency won't fail to &s;cour the ket|tle,
<PB N="240" REF="253">
and boil the chain, and bury the
tree, and plant the hatchet&mdash;Ha, ha,
ha!&endq; When he had uttered this rhap|&s;ody,
with his u&s;ual precipitation, Mr.
Barton gave him to under&s;tand, that I
was neither Sir Francis, nor St. Francis,
but &s;imply Mr. Melford, nephew to Mr.
Bramble; who, &s;tepping forward, made
his bow at the &s;ame time. &startq;Od&s;o! no
more it is Sir Francis&mdash;(&s;aid this wi&s;e
&s;tate&s;man) Mr. Melford, I'm glad to
&s;ee you&mdash;I &s;ent you an engineer to for|tify
your dock&mdash;Mr. Bramble&mdash;your
&s;ervant, Mr. Bramble&mdash;How d'ye, good
Mr. Bramble? Your nephew is a pretty
young fellow&mdash;Faith and troth, a very
pretty fellow!&mdash;His father is my old
friend&mdash;How does he hold it? Still
troubled with that damned di&s;order,
ha?&endq; &startq;No, my lord, (replied my un|cle)
all his troubles are over&mdash;He has
been dead the&s;e fifteen years.&endq; &startq;Dead!
how&mdash;Yes, faith! now I remember:
he is dead, &s;ure enough&mdash;Well, and
how&mdash;does the young gentleman &s;tand
for Haverford We&s;t? or&mdash;a&mdash;what
d'ye&mdash;My dear Mr. Milfordhaven, I'll
do you all the &s;ervice in my power&mdash;I
hope I have &s;ome credit left&mdash;&endq; My
uncle then gave him to under&s;tand, that
<PB N="241" REF="254">
I was &s;till a minor; and that we had no
intention to trouble him at pre&s;ent, for
any favour what&s;oever&mdash;&startq;I came hither
with my nephew (added he) to pay our
re&s;pects to your grace; and I may ve$$|ture
to &s;ay, that his views and mine
are at lea&s;t as di&s;intere&s;ted as tho&s;e
of any individual in this a&s;&s;embly.&endq;
&startq;My dear Mr. Brambleberry! you do
me infinite honour&mdash;I &s;hall always re|joice
to &s;ee you and your hopeful
nephew, Mr. Milfordhaven&mdash;My cre|dit,
&s;uch as it is, you may command&mdash;
I wi&s;h we had more friends of your
kidney&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Then, turning to captain C&mdash;, &startq;Ha,
C&mdash;! (&s;aid he) what news, C&mdash;?
How does the world wag? ha!&endq; &startq;The
world wags much after the old fa&s;hion,
my lord (an&s;wered the captain): the
politicians of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter
have begun again to wag their tongues
again&s;t your grace; and your &s;hort|lived
popularity wags like a feather,
which the next puff of antimini&s;terial
calumny will blow away&mdash;&endq; &startq;A pack
of ra&s;cals (cried the duke)&mdash;Tories,
Jacobites, rebels; one half of them
would wag their heels at Tyburn, if
<PB N="242" REF="255">
they had their de&s;erts&mdash;&endq; So &s;aying,
he wheeled about; and, going round the
levee, &s;poke to every individual, with the
mo&s;t courteous familiarity; but he &s;carce
ever opened his mouth without making
&s;ome blunder, in relation to the per&s;on
or bu&s;ine&s;s of the party with whom he
conver&s;ed; &s;o that he really looked like
a comedian, hired to burle&s;que the cha|racter
of a mini&s;ter&mdash;At length, a per&s;on
of a very prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing appearance com|ing
in, his grace ran up, and, hugging
him in his arms, with the appellation of
&startq;My dear Ch&mdash;s!&endq; led him forthwith
into the inner apartment, or <HI>Sanctum
Sactorum</HI> of this political temple. &startq;That
(&s;aid captain C&mdash;) is my friend C&mdash;
T&mdash;, almo&s;t the only man of parts
who has any concern in the pre&s;ent ad|mini&s;tration&mdash;Indeed,
he would have
no concern at all in the matter, if the
mini&s;try did not find it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to make u&s;e of his talents upon
&s;ome particular occa&s;ions&mdash;As for the
common bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, it is
carried on in a con&s;tant routine by the
clerks of the different offices, other|wi&s;e
the wheels of government would
be wholly &s;topt amid&s;t the abrupt &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="243" REF="256">
of mini&s;ters, every one more ig|norant
than his predece&s;&s;or&mdash;I am
thinking what a fine hovel we &s;hould
be in, if all the clerks of the trea&s;ury,
of the &s;ecretaries, the war-office, and
the admiralty, &s;hould take it in their
heads to throw up their places in imi|tation
of the great pen&s;ioner&mdash;But, to
return to C&mdash;T&mdash;; he certainly
knows more than all the mini&s;try and
all the oppo&s;ition, if their heads were
laid together, and talks like an angel
on a va&s;t variety of &s;ubjects&mdash;He would
really be a great man, if he had any
con&s;i&s;tency or &s;tability of character&mdash;
Then, it mu&s;t be owned, he wants
courage, otherwi&s;e he would never al|low
him&s;elf to be cowed by the great
political bully, for who&s;e under&s;tand|ing
he has ju&s;tly a very great con|tempt.
I have &s;een him as much afraid
of that overbearing Hector, as ever
&s;chool-boy was of his pedagogue; and
yet this Hector, I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect, is
no more than a craven at bottom&mdash;Be|&s;ides
this defect, C&mdash;has another,
which he is at too little pains to hide
&mdash;There's no faith to be given to his
a&s;&s;ertions, and no tru&s;t to be put in his
<PB N="244" REF="257">
promi&s;es&mdash;However, to give the devil
his due, he's very good-natured; and
even friendly, when clo&s;e urged in the
way of &s;olicitation&mdash;As for principle,
that's out of the que&s;tion&mdash;In a word,
he is a wit and an orator, extremely
entertaining, and he &s;hines very often
at the expence even of tho&s;e mini&s;ters
to whom he is a retainer&mdash;This is a
mark of great imprudence, by which
he has made them all his enemies,
whatever face they may put upon the
matter; and &s;ooner or later he'll have
cau&s;e to wi&s;h he had been able to keep
his own coun&s;el&mdash;I have &s;everal times
cautioned him on this &s;ubject; but 'tis
all preaching to the de&s;ert&mdash;His vanity
runs away with his di&s;cretion&mdash;&endq; I
could not help thinking the captain him|&s;elf
might have been the better for &s;ome
hints of the &s;ame nature&mdash;His panegyric,
excluding principle and veracity, puts me
in mind of a conte&s;t I once over-heard, in
the way of altercation, betwixt two ap|ple-women
in Spring-garden&mdash;One of
tho&s;e viragos having hinted &s;omething to
the prejudice of the other's moral cha|racter,
her antagoni&s;t, &s;etting her hands
in her &s;ides, replied&mdash;&startq;Speak out, hu&s;&s;y
<PB N="245" REF="258">
&mdash;I &s;corn your malice&mdash;I own I'm both
a whore and a thief; and what more
have you to &s;ay?&mdash;Damn you, what
more have you to &s;ay? bating that,
which all the world knows, I challenge
you to &s;ay black is the white of my
eye&mdash;&endq; We did not wait for Mr. T&mdash;'s
coming forth; but after captain C&mdash;
had characteri&s;ed all the originals in wait|ing,
we adjourned to a coffee-hou&s;e,
where we had buttered muffins and tea
to breakfa&s;t, the &s;aid captain &s;till favour|ing
us with his company&mdash;Nay, my un|cle
was &s;o diverted with his anecdotes,
that he a&s;ked him to dinner, and treated
him with a fine turbot, to which he did
ample ju&s;tice&mdash;That &s;ame evening I &s;pent
at the tavern with &s;ome friends, one of
whom let me into C&mdash;'s character, which
Mr. Bramble no &s;ooner under&s;tood, than
he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern for the con|nexion
he had made, and re&s;olved to di&s;|engage
him&s;elf from it without cere|mony.</P>
<P>We are become members of the Socie|ty
for the Encouragement of the Arts, and
have a&s;&s;i&s;ted at &s;ome of their delibera|tions,
which were conducted with equal
&s;pirit and &s;agacity&mdash;My uncle is extreme|ly
<PB N="246" REF="259">
fond of the in&s;titution, which will
certainly be productive of great advant|ages
to the public, if, from its democra|tical
form, it does not degenerate into ca|bal
and corruption&mdash;You are already ac|quainted
with his aver&s;ion to the influence
of the multitude, which, he affirms, is
incompatible with excellence, and &s;ub|ver&s;ive
of order&mdash;Indeed his dete&s;tation
of the mob has been heightened by fear,
ever &s;ince he fainted in the room at Bath;
and this apprehen&s;ion has prevented him
from going to the Little Theatre in the
Hay-market, and other places of enter|tainment,
to which, however, I have had
the honour to attend the ladies.</P>
<P>It grates old Square-Toes to reflect,
that it is not in his power to enjoy even
the mo&s;t elegant diver&s;ions of the capital,
without the participation of the vulgar;
for they now thru&s;t them&s;elves into all
a&s;&s;emblies, from a ridotto at St. James's,
to a hop at Rotherhithe.</P>
<P>I have lately &s;een our old acquaintance
Dick Ivy, who we imagined had died of
dram-drinking; but he is lately emerg|ed
from the Fleet, by means of a pamph|let
which he wrote and publi&s;hed again&s;t
the government with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. The
<PB N="247" REF="260">
&s;ale of this performance enabled him to
appear in clean linen, and he is now go|ing
about &s;oliciting &s;ub&s;criptions for his
Poems; but his breeches are not yet in
the mo&s;t decent order.</P>
<P>Dick certainly de&s;erves &s;ome counte|nance
for his intrepidity and per&s;eve|rance&mdash;It
is not in the power of di&s;ap|pointment,
nor even of damnation, to drive
him to de&s;pair&mdash;After &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful
e&s;&s;ays in the way of poetry, he com|menced
brandy-merchant, and I believe
his whole &s;tock ran out through his own
bowels; then he con&s;orted with a milk-|woman,
who kept a cellar in Petty
France: but he could not make his
quarters good; he was di&s;lodged and
driven up &s;tairs into the kennel by a cor|poral
in the &s;econd regiment of foot-guards&mdash;He
was afterwards the laureat of
Blackfriars&punc; from whence there was a na|tural
tran&s;ition to the Fleet&mdash;As he had
formerly mi&s;carried in panegyric, he now
turned his thoughts to &s;atire, and really
&s;eems to have &s;ome talent for abu&s;e. If
he can hold out till the meeting of the
parliament, and be prepared for another
charge, in all probability Dick will
<PB N="248" REF="261">
mount the pillory, or obtain a pen&s;ion,
in either of which events his fortune will
be made&mdash;Mean while he has acquired
&s;ome degree of con&s;ideration with the re|&s;pectable
writers of the age; and as I
have &s;ub&s;cribed for his works, he did me
the favour 'tother night to introduce me
to a &s;ociety of tho&s;e geniu&s;es; but I found
them exceedingly formal and re&s;erved&mdash;
They &s;eemed afraid and jealous of one
another, and &s;at in a &s;tate of mutual re|pul&s;ion,
like &s;o many particles of vapour,
each &s;urrounded by its own electrified at|mo&s;phere.
Dick, who has more vivacity
than judgment, tried more than once to
enliven the conver&s;ation; &s;ometimes mak|ing
an effort at wit, &s;ometimes letting off a
pun, and &s;ometimes di&s;charging a conun|drum;
nay, at length he &s;tarted a di&s;|pute
upon the hackneyed compari&s;on
betwixt blank ver&s;e and rhyme, and the
profe&s;&s;ors opened with great clamour;
but, in&s;tead of keeping to the &s;ubject,
they launched out into tedious di&s;&s;erta|tions
on the poetry of the antients; and
one of them, who had been a &s;chool|ma&s;ter,
di&s;played his whole knowledge
of pro&s;ody, gleaned from Di&s;puter and
<PB N="249" REF="262">
Ruddiman. At la&s;t, I ventured to &s;ay,
I did not &s;ee how the &s;ubject in que&s;tion
could be at all elucidated by the practice
of the antients, who certainly had neither
blank ver&s;e nor rhyme in their poems,
which were mea&s;ured by feet, whereas
ours are reckoned by the number of
&s;yllables&mdash;This remark &s;eemed to give
umbrage to the pedant, who forthwith
involved him&s;elf in a cloud of Greek
and Latin quotations, which nobody at|tempted
to di&s;pel&mdash;A confu&s;ed hum of
in&s;ipid ob&s;ervations and comments en|&s;ued;
and, upon the whole, I never pa&s;&s;|ed
a duller evening in my life&mdash;Yet, with|out
all doubt, &s;ome of them were men of
learning, wit, and ingenuity. As they
are afraid of making free with one an|other,
they &s;hould bring each his butt,
or whet-&s;tone, along with him, for the
entertainment of the company&mdash;My un|cle
&s;ays, he never de&s;ires to meet with
more than one wit at a time&mdash;One wit,
like a knuckle of ham in &s;oup, gives a
ze&s;t and flavour to the di&s;h; but more than
one &s;erves only to &s;poil the pottage&mdash;
And now I'm afraid I have given you an
uncon&s;cionable me&s;s, without any flavour
<PB N="250" REF="263">
at all; for which, I &s;uppo&s;e, you will be|&s;tow
your benedictions upon</P>
