<P>ON Thur&s;day la&s;t, after I had begun to prepare the&s;e Papers for the Pre&s;s, my friend Mr. Rice, between whom and Mr. Rutherford a very &s;erious difference had that day been brought to a happy con|clu&s;ion, intreated me, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t terms, at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pend my Publication; as he had yet hopes, by his pre&s;ent influence with Mr. Rutherford, to accommodate our differences. I con&s;ented, and went the next morning to Richmond, where I received the following letter from Mr. Rice, the contents of which induced me to re&s;ume my thoughts of publication; and indeed, rendered it incumbent on me to expedite it as much as po&s;&s;ible; which I hope will be fome apology for the appa|rent ha&s;te and inaccuracy of the following Narrative. The attention due to it mu&s;t, however, depend upon facts. Mr. Rice's letter is as follows; and is publi&s;hed at his own reque&s;t.</P>

<P>"YOU may remember that I acquainted you before you went out of town, that the moment the affair of la&s;t Thur&s;day was over, I thought it a very proper opportunity to avail my&s;elf of the &s;ituation I then &s;tood in, and told Mr. Rutherford the only advantage I would wi&s;h to make of the many advantages I had then given him, would be to ren|der my&s;elf the in&s;trument of bringing about a thorough reconciliation in the Theatre: Mr. Rutherford replied, that nothing in the world would give him greater plea&s;ure; and that he &s;hould be the happie&s;t man living if tho&s;e di&s;putes were once &s;ettled. From the many compli|ments Mr. Rutherford paid me on this occa&s;ion, and the very conciliat|ing di&s;po&s;ition he was then in, I really was weak enough to believe him &s;incere. I &s;aw him the &s;ame evening at the Playhou&s;e, and we agreed to meet the next day at Mr. Harris's in Surry-&s;treet. If you recollect, I begged you not to proceed in your Publication. I went to Mr. Harris's at the time appointed, and to my great &s;urprize found only Mr. Harris, who made an apology for Mr. Rutherford's not being there, but &s;aid that Mr. Rutherford would meet me any where in the evening, if I would leave word where I was to be found. I mentioned the Bedford Coffee-hou&s;e. Mr. Harris's conver&s;ation and mine was rather general, as. I told him that my bu&s;ine&s;s was with Mr. Rutherford; that I thought I had a claim upon that gentleman, and meant to u&s;e it to make all the Patentees friends; and that I &s;hould make a point of Mr. Rutherford's u&s;ing his influence with <HI>him</HI> to bring about a reconciliation of all parties. Though Mr. Harris did not &s;eem &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to a compromi&s;e as Mr. Ruther|ford, yet he did not give me the lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect the <HI>manoeuvre</HI> of this

In the mean time, the Publick Adverti&s;er was brought me as u&s;ual, when, to my very great a&s;toni&s;hment, I &s;aw their Narrative adverti&s;ed. Mr. Rutherford came at the time appointed in his note. It was with great difficulty I could keep my temper with him; and I told him, in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Allen and a Hairdre&s;&s;er, that I did intend to &s;ay a great deal to him, but that the very di&s;ingenuous manner he had dealt with me, had put it out of my power to have any thing to &s;ay to him or his friend Mr. Harris; adding, "Had you told me, or even &s;ent me word ye&s;terday, that my interfering was quite unnece&s;&s;ary, as your Ca&s;e was to be publi&s;hed this morning, I am &s;ure I could not have been in the lea&s;t offended; but, in&s;tead of that, you con&s;ented to confer about an accommodation, and concealed your intention of pub|li&s;hing your Narrative: Such di&s;ingenuous treatment from you I thought I did not de&s;erve. I now renounce you both for ever, and think you a couple of people capable of doing every thing that is bad." He &s;aid, he was very &s;orry for my ill opinion of him; but declared, notwith|&s;tanding what had pa&s;&s;ed, that any thing I had to &s;ay in this di&s;pute, &s;hould have more weight with him than the remon&s;trances or argu|ments of any other per&s;on.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon my Narrative, it may not be improper to acquaint the Publick with the rea&s;ons that have induced me to give them this trouble; <Q>and to &s;hew them that &s;ilence mu&s;t have been interpreted as a tacit acknowledgment of guilt in my&s;elf and Mr. Powell, who could not forbear to reply to the mo&s;t gro&s;s and open ca|lumnies, if we entertained a proper regard for our reputations, and wi&s;hed to be con&s;idered as men who held their good name &startq;as the im|mediate jewel of their &s;ouls.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Contempt of &s;lander is indeed an heroick quality, and con&s;cious inno|cence is the &s;ure&s;t antidote to its poi&s;on. But there are circum&s;tances wherein the world has a kind of right to arraign our conduct; not to mention, that it requires a very uncommon &s;hare of philo&s;ophy not to refute &s;candal and malice, when we have the means of ju&s;tification in our power.</P>
<P>On Saturday, the 23d of January, we were informed that there lay for publick in&s;pection, at Slaughter's Coffee-hou&s;e, in St. Martin's-lane, a manu&s;cript paper, wherein we were charged, in direct terms, with the mo&s;t infamous collu&s;ion in the management of the Theatre; a collu&s;ion intended to promote our own &s;eparate and private emolument, and con&s;e|quently to defraud Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris, the joint &s;harers in the property.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e two gentlemen had for &s;ome preceding weeks betrayed the mo&s;t ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition toward us, and endeavoured to render the management of the Theatre as hazardous as it is trouble&s;ome; yet that they, or their friends, &s;hould think it advi&s;able to appeal to the Publick, by drawing up a partial &s;tate of our differences, &s;eemed almo&s;t incredible. In the evening, however, we repaired to the Coffee-room, and on a peru&s;al of the libellous paper in que&s;tion, we found it to be more replete with fal&s;hood, &s;candal, and malice, than it had even been repre&s;ented to us; nor indeed was it po&s;&s;ible for any per&s;on, not minutely acquainted with the facts, to di&s;cern how much they were di&s;torted in order to give the lea&s;t colour to the charges brought again&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was indor&s;ed, "A narrative of tran&s;actions relative to Covent Garden Theatre." And at &s;ome di&s;tance was written, <HI>in another hand,</HI> "For the u&s;e of the gentlemen of Slaughter's Coffee-hou&s;e;" which words were al&s;o written on the margin of the &s;everal leaves of the manu&s;cript.</NOTE> The paper was conceived in the following terms:</P>
<P><HI>A &s;hort &s;tate of the ca&s;e between</HI> THOMAS HARRIS, JOHN RUTHERFORD, GEORGE COLMAN, <HI>and</HI> WILLIAM POWELL.</P>
<P>"THE patents, &amp;c. of Covent Garden Theatre, being to be &s;old, pur&s;uant to the direction of the late Mr. Rich's will; Thomas Harris and John Ruther|ford formed a de&s;ign of purcha&s;ing them, and entered into a treaty with the exe|cutors of &s;aid Rich; but afterwards thought proper to invite &s;ome one per&s;on con|ver&s;ant in the&s;e matters to &s;hare with them in the purcha&s;e; one who might &s;trengthen the company as a performer, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the management there|of.&mdash;They pitched upon William Powell the player, to whom the plan was com|municated.&mdash;At fir&s;t his only objection was, an article &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the patentees of Drury Lane Theatre; but he afterwards, in his own mind, got over that difficulty, and propo&s;ed a friend of his, George Colman, a dramatic au|thor; and urged the expediency of admitting him into the treaty, by greatly exag|gerating the &s;ervice he would do in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Theatrical Management.&mdash;At length Harris and Rutherford agreed, not only to the admi&s;&s;ion of William Powell, but al&s;o his friend George Colman. Whereon, March 31&s;t, 1767, the&s;e four gentlemen entered into articles of agreement between them&s;elves, for concluding &s;uch purcha&s;e; and Harris and Rutherford were impowered to conclude the treaty they had begun on their own account, and the four parties were to be equal &s;harers.</P>
<P>"April 1&s;t, Harris and Rutherford contracted for the purcha&s;e, and 10,000 l. the property of Harris and Rutherford, was depo&s;ited on that day, the remainder of the 60,000 l. to be paid the 1&s;t July next en&s;uing. And &s;oon after, all four parties met on the &s;ubject of their future articles, when Colman propo&s;ed to have the uncontrouled management, which Powell approved; but Harris and Rutherford, (being exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed) warmly, and reiteratedly, prote&s;ted they never would con&s;ent to any other articles, but &s;uch as would give them a perfect equality of power with Colman. Whereupon, after much deliberation, the four gentlemen, on 14th May la&s;t, &s;igned an agreement, by which Colman was appointed acting manager, with this re&s;triction, that he was from time to time, <HI>and at all times,</HI> to communicate and &s;ubmit his conduct, and the <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> he &s;hould intend to pur&s;ue, unto Harris and Rutherford, who were impowered to put a negative on any &s;uch mea&s;ure which they &s;hould jointly di&s;approve.</P>
<P>"Powell was to give his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance when required.</P>
<P>"May 28th, Powell was engaged as an actor for &s;even years, at 400 l. a year, and a clear benefit; and if any performer, or player, &s;hould be allowed more, then an additional charge was to be allowed Powell, &s;o as to exceed &s;uch <HI>future</HI> player. 2d, None of the parties &s;hould have any concern in any other theatre.</P>
<P>July 1&s;t, The contract with Rich's executors was compleated, and the money then paid; but Colman and Powell were deficient in their proportion of purcha&s;e-money
<PB N="3" REF="7">
9,000l. whereupon the &s;um was borrowed, and Harris and Rutherford were &s;ecurities for Colman and Powell.</P>
<P>"No &s;ooner were they in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the theatre, &amp;c. but Colman began to act in a mo&s;t arbitrary and in&s;olent manner; he &s;carce even deign'd to con&s;ult Har|ris and Rutherford in any one mea&s;ure; he received and rejected dramatic pieces; engaging and refu&s;ing performers, &amp;c. &amp;c. without ever mentioning them; and at the fir&s;t rehear&s;al, in&s;tead of introducing them to the performers, (which were fixed by him) he forbad them the &s;tage, thereby endeavouring to prevent Harris and Rutherford from &s;uperintending his conduct.</P>
<P>"After much expo&s;tulation, Colman a&s;&s;ented to a weekly meeting, when he, Colman, was to propo&s;e &s;uch plays, &amp;c. and all &s;uch other mea&s;ures, as he thought might be proper for the week following. This meeting was ob&s;erved by all parties for a few weeks; yet Harris and Rutherford could not help &s;eeing, that Colman did not, at the meetings, propo&s;e all the mea&s;ures he intended to pur&s;ue; and that when he knew the &s;entiments of Harris and Rutherford, he generally acted in contradiction to them.</P>
<P>"Fearing to throw the whole affair into confu&s;ion, Harris and Rutherford bore this kind of treatment, and repeated in&s;ults, from Colman, without re&s;enting them, as he &s;till kept, in &s;ome degree, the rank of decency, and did not openly di&s;claim their negative power; but on Thur&s;day, the day of October, he, in the highe&s;t terms, and mo&s;t aggravating language, openly di&s;claimed their right of re&s;training him, and &s;olemnly declared, that to them he would never di&s;clo&s;e his future intentions; and that he would be re&s;pon&s;ible to the public, not to them, for the con&s;equences. Though <HI>they knew of no cau&s;e,</HI> yet this appeared to them the language of pa&s;&s;ion or madne&s;s; therefore, he was again, the &s;ucceeding day, a&s;ked, if he would comply with his articles, and propo&s;e his mea&s;ures, &amp;c. Ac|cordingly he again refu&s;ed; and being expo&s;tulated with again and again, he on Saturday night declared, he would have no further communication with either of them; yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, on Sunday November the 1&s;t, he wrote them a letter, (vide copy marked A) wherein he recognizes the articles, recapitulates the &s;ub&s;tance of them, and promi&s;es to adhere to them for the future: but (&s;trange as it mu&s;t appear!) he &s;o &s;oon forgot his promi&s;e, that without having either <HI>heard from,</HI> or &s;een &s;aid Harris and Rutherford, he, on the very &s;ame night, and with|out their knowledge, or giving them the lea&s;t notice thereof, &s;ummoned all the principal performers to a tavern, and there harangued them, and acquainted them, that he was inve&s;ted with the ab&s;olute management of the theatre, and entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed Harris and Rutherford's right of controuling him. This conduct oblig|ed Harris and Rutherford to read publicly on the &s;tage, on Monday morning, the whole articles, when Colman, in appearance, took &s;hame to him&s;elf, and declar|ed, in the pre&s;ence of Woodward, Smith, and Gib&s;on, &amp;c. that he would &s;ub|mit his mea&s;ures to their controlment.</P>
<P>"During the&s;e tran&s;actions, it was impo&s;&s;ible for Harris and Rutherford to be blind to the ridiculous partialities of Colman; yet they were of opinion, the cau&s;es of them were of &s;uch a nature, that as men, they could not take notice of them; but the in&s;tance was &s;o glaring, in ca&s;ting the play of Cymbeline, that, <HI>in duty to the public,</HI> Harris and Rutherford were obliged to take notice of it. What can be more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to men who have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of honour or gene|ro&s;ity, than being obliged to di&s;clo&s;e the foibles and infirmities of others! yet a conci&s;e and true declaration of this &s;ort, Harris and Rutherford find to be the only
<PB N="4" REF="8">
way that can clear them&s;elves and others, from the imputation Colman has no le&s;s artfully than wickedly put upon them. The uncommon effrontery Colman has exhibited in making a &s;uppo&s;ed partiality to a certain actre&s;s, his great plea of complaint, and even carrying his a&s;&s;urance to &s;uch a height, as to &s;ummons the friends of Harris and Rutherford, with others who were &s;trangers to them, and then wickedly depending on alarming and frightening them with fal&s;e accounts of their conduct re&s;pecting the above lady, the <HI>narrators</HI> hope will be deemed a &s;uffi|cient occa&s;ion for their &s;etting that affair in a clear light.&mdash;Colman had conceived a violent pique and re&s;entment again&s;t the above-mentioned actre&s;s, the cau&s;e of which &s;hall not be here related; but whil&s;t others are conjecturing, Colman mu&s;t burn with &s;hame, as that lady's conduct had ever been mo&s;t unexceptionable in the theatre. Harris and Rutherford could not help frequently expo&s;tulating on the injuries he delighted to inflict on her; in particular, although the whole theatre deemed her, as the company then &s;tood, <HI>(Mrs. Yates being not then engaged)</HI> the propere&s;t per&s;on to have the part of Imogen in the play of Cymbeline: yet he, (Colman) at once to gratify his re&s;entment to her, his lu&s;t of acting contrary to the opinion of Harris and Rutherford, and his &s;pirit of gallantry, in&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t heartily, that that character &s;hould be given to a certain <HI>young</HI> actre&s;s; but with much ado he was &s;hamed from his purpo&s;e, and he pledged his honour, that the fir&s;t mentioned lady &s;hould have the character.&mdash;It may not be improper to re|mark here, that after Mrs. Yates was engaged, <HI>it was univer&s;ally acknowledged,</HI> that no per&s;on in our company could &s;tand in competition with her for that cha|racter.&mdash;Yet, after the conce&s;&s;ions that were made by Colman, November the 2d, and the reconciliation that en&s;ued, it was agreed by all parties, that as Colman had ab&s;urdly made that play a matter of di&s;pute, it &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, and not got ready for exhibition, until approved by Harris and Rutherford; but notwith|&s;tanding that, he has &s;ince, viz. on the day of thought proper to perform it in oppo&s;ition to their written di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>"On the day of Colman took upon him, without the knowledge or con&s;ent of Harris and Rutherford, to contract with Mr. and Mrs. Yates as players, viz. Mrs. Yates at 500 l. per annum, and Mr. Yates at 10 l. a week, with benefits.&mdash;Though the merit of the&s;e two performers would at fir&s;t &s;ight induce one to think, that this &s;tep, though irregular, was for the intere&s;t of the proprietors, yet, in fact, it has turned out <HI>very much the rever&s;e;</HI> nay, it had been viewed in that light three or four days before by all the proprietors, who jointly declared their &s;entiments again&s;t &s;uch a &s;tep.&mdash;Colman engaging them in this clande&s;tine manner may be accounted for from the following motives:&mdash;Fir&s;t, <HI>being very avaricious,</HI> and Powell and him&s;elf being in perfect collu&s;ion from fir&s;t to la&s;t, he, by giving 500 l. to Mrs. Yates, made an addition to Powell's &s;alary of 100 l. per annum: and again, by doing an act of &s;o much con&s;equence, without the knowledge of Harris and Rutherford, and even again&s;t their con&s;ent; he there|by meant to prove to the whole theatre, that he could and would act without con&s;ulting or regarding them; and, in con&s;equence, expo&s;e Harris and Rutherford to deri&s;ion. That this was a powerful motive, was plain from his immediate &s;ub&s;equent boa&s;tings&mdash;"That he had made this engagement on his own authority."&mdash;The real lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by this mea&s;ure cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than 1500 l. which may be thus made appear: The &s;alaries of capital performers, that were before en|gaged, and now rendered u&s;ele&s;s, the addition of Powell's &s;alary, the incredible
<PB N="5" REF="9">
expence of dre&s;&s;es for Mrs. Yates;&mdash;add to this, a lo&s;s which has been exceedingly heavy, though it cannot be a&s;certained, incurred by Colman's neglecting his duty in reviewing and getting up all other plays, except tho&s;e in which the two above|mentioned performers, and William Powell, had capital characters; endeavouring by &s;uch mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable means, to give colour and &s;anction to the &s;tep he had taken.</P>
<P>"The following is a proof of the glaring degree to which Colman and Powell car|ried their collu&s;ion. At a meeting, on or about the 20th of November la&s;t, between all the four parties, Colman propo&s;ed taking out of the trea&s;ury a &s;um from 64 to 70l. on account of the in&s;ertion of a few lines in the Rehear&s;al, and his propo&s;ed alterations of King Lear; to all which Powell concurred immediately, and warm|ly; but Harris and Rutherford remon&s;trated, that it would be more proper to take the money after the tragedy was produced. Yet, notwith&s;tanding, Colman did take out of the trea&s;ury that &s;um, between 64 and 70l. &s;ince which Harris and Rutherford have neither &s;een nor heard of the play. At the very &s;ame meeting, Powell, notwith&s;tanding his articles to the contrary, earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted on the equity of his having the benefit ari&s;ing from &s;ome one night, on account of his not going to Bri&s;tol theatre in the en&s;uing &s;ummer; to which propo&s;al Colman immediately and warmly concurred. At length, to avoid di&s;pute, Harris and Rutherford con|&s;ented that Powell &s;hould go to Bri&s;tol theatre, but Colman refu&s;ed; notwith&s;tand|ing he urged the propriety of giving him a benefit, and flew into a great heat and pa&s;&s;ion becau&s;e Harris and Rutherford would not con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>"What aggravates, to Harris and Rutherford, the very extraordinary expences for dre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. is, that Colman has taken upon him, with &s;ome fini&s;ter view or other, to depo&s;it a great part of the wardrobe, amounting to a very large &s;um, in the hou&s;e of Mr. Powell, in&s;tead of the place appointed for that purpo&s;e in the theatre; and Powell, in the mo&s;t in&s;ulting terms, refu&s;es to bring them to the pro|per place, though applied to by letter.</P>
<P>"Through Mr. Colman's ill conduct, in the management of the theatre, in mea&s;ures pur&s;ed without the knowledge, or again&s;t the con&s;ent, of Harris and Rutherford, <HI>they verily believe</HI> a lo&s;s not le&s;s than 3,500 l. has been &s;u&s;tained; which &s;um will not appear extraordinary, to tho&s;e who know the very large receipts and di&s;bur&s;ements of a theatre, and which altogether depend on the management thereof.</P>
<P>"It is not &s;o much the abovementioned <HI>lo&s;&s;es</HI> that alarm Harris and Rutherford, as that they plainly perceive the ultimate views of Colman and Powell to be their total exclu&s;ion, which they purpo&s;e to bring about, by &s;etting them, Harris and Rutherford, at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and keeping them &s;o ignorant of their own af|fairs, that they may not be able to &s;ee through the future operations of Colman and Powell; and which will unque&s;tionably be directed for the purpo&s;e of their private emolument.</P>
<P>"From the foregoing ca&s;e, how very unju&s;tifiable the behaviour of Colman and Powell is, in per&s;i&s;ting (in de&s;pite of honour and hone&s;ty, and the known original intentions of Harris and Rutherford, and their pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ting articles) to <HI>mi&s;|manage</HI> their property, every reader is left to determine."</P>
<P>On Monday, January 25, the Prompter of the Theatre, a very hone&s;t and inte$l$gent man, who thought him&s;elf a party aggrieved by that
<PB N="6" REF="10">
part of the paper which related to a <HI>certain young actre&s;s,</HI> waited on Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford, who both di&s;claimed any knowledge of &s;uch a paper having been expo&s;ed till within two hours before that in|&s;tant; adding, however, <HI>that they could ea&s;ily conjecture the quarter from which it proceeded, and &s;eeming to a&s;cribe the publication of it to the intempe|rate zeal of &s;ome particular friend.</HI> Upon their expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to &s;ee the paper, the Prompter produced a copy of it; which Mr. Rutherford turned over with much apparent eagerne&s;s and curio&s;ity, and joined with Mr. Harris in a reque&s;t that it might be left in their hands. It was &s;o, and the Prompter departed; but not without previou&s;ly declaring, that, &s;ince the Paper did not appear to have their &s;anction, he hoped they would not be offended, if he took every occa&s;ion of te&s;tifying his contempt and dete&s;tation of that part of it, which was relative to a <HI>certain young actre&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>"MR.

<P>The &s;ame evening Mr. Harris told the Prompter, that it was hoped he would not be too violent or acrimonious in his language concerning the written paper left at Slaughter's; for although Mr. Rutherford and him&s;elf utterly di&s;claimed the circulation of it, yet as malevolent per|&s;ons would undoubtedly attribute it to them, &s;uch language from him would be con&s;idered as an indirect affront to them&s;elves.</P>

At this interview another gentleman, whom Mr. Bury &s;uppo&s;ed to be Mr. Rutherford, was pre&s;ent. This application, however, proved as fruitle&s;s as the former. Mr. Harris &s;aid that they could &s;end no written an&s;wer, nor any verbal me&s;&s;age: and upon being a&s;ked what was the in|tention of their adverti&s;ement, again replied, that they could &s;end no written an&s;wer, nor any verbal me&s;&s;age. Mr. Bury then ob&s;erved, that Mr. Powell and Mr. Colman <HI>had publickly declared them&s;elves to have been injured by the paper;</HI> and a&s;ked if tho&s;e gentlemen, on a per&s;onal appli|cation to them, (Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford) might receive the infor|mation promi&s;ed in the adverti&s;ement. Mr. Harris replied, that they could &s;end no other an&s;wer than what he had ju&s;t before given.</P>
<P>Upon enquiry after the manner in which the Paper came to be ex|hibited at Slaughter's Coffee-hou&s;e, the fact &s;tands thus.</P>
<P>On Saturday, January 23, about noon, as Mr. Julliott, of Henrietta|&s;treet, apothecary, was &s;itting in a box at Slaughter's Coffee-hou&s;e, reading the news-papers, two young gentlemen entered the room, and de&s;ired to pa&s;s him. They pa&s;&s;ed him, and &s;at down in the &s;ame box. After &s;ome time they pulled out a book and a written paper, and called for pen and ink. The bar-maid a&s;ked, if they did not want any <HI>paper?</HI> They replied in the negative, and u&s;ed the pen and ink in making in&s;er|tions or era&s;ements, or both, in the manu&s;cript which they had ju&s;t be|fore produced. In about a quarter of an hour they departed; and Mr. Julliott, after having &s;ufficiently amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the news-papers, happened to ca&s;t his eye on the manu&s;cript, which lay on the table. At fir&s;t he thought it might have been by <HI>accident left</HI> there; but &s;eeing it indor&s;ed, "A Narrative of Tran&s;actions relative to Covent-Garden-Theatre," took it for granted, from the title, that it was left there for general in&s;pection, and accordingly made no &s;cruple to examine the con|tents of it; on peru&s;al of which he told the &s;ervant in the bar, that it re|lated to the di&s;putes among the Covent-Garden Managers; and that he &s;uppo&s;ed that the two Gentlemen who had ju&s;t left the room, were no other than Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris.</P>
<P>Mr. Julliott does not recollect that the Paper was al&s;o indor&s;ed, "For the u&s;e of the Gentlemen of Slaughter's Coffee-hou&s;e," at the time that he &s;aw it. Mr. Pre&s;ton, the ma&s;ter of the Coffee-hou&s;e, is confident that neither he, nor any of his people to the be&s;t of his knowledge or be|lief, added tho&s;e words; and a gentleman (who&s;e name will be mentioned if the fact is di&s;puted) who peru&s;ed the paper about two o'clock the &s;ame day, well remembers that it was then &s;o indor&s;ed.</P>
<P>It has been contended that this Paper was nothing more than the heads of a Law-Ca&s;e, left by accident on a Coffee-hou&s;e table. The &s;ub|&s;tance of it may have been, and I believe has been, laid before Coun&s;el;
<PB N="10" REF="14">
but the very form of it, as it now &s;tands, pronounces it to have been drawn up with another view. Be that as it may, it lay for three days toge|ther in the Coffee-room, as common and publick as the Daily Adverti&s;er; &s;o that the characters of the parties vilified were equally injured, whether it was left there by accident or de&s;ign. We have &s;tiled this paper "a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious libel." We repeat tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, confident that every di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reader of the following narrative will a&s;&s;ent to the ju&s;tice and propriety of the terms in which we have &s;poken of the Paper. The charges of collu&s;ion and fraud affect us too deeply to be mentioned without &s;ome emotion. As to the virulence and malignity of the &s;tile, and the words "effrontery," "a&s;&s;urance," "void of honour and hone&s;ty," &amp;c. &amp;c. we take them from whence they come, and con&s;ider them as mere paper and packthread to make up the parcel of &s;candal. The expre&s;&s;ions of contempt thrown on us on account of &s;uppo&s;ed talents, which we &s;hould be proud to po&s;&s;e&s;s, give us no pain; and we look on the terms <HI>William Powell the Player,</HI> and <HI>George Colman a Dramatick Au|thor,</HI> as mere words of cour&s;e, like John Rutherford, and Thomas Harris, <HI>E&s;quires.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;cious of the integrity of my actions, and that the more my con|duct was known to the world, the more fully it would be ju&s;tified, I have in &s;ome peevi&s;h moments, when provoked to the uttermo&s;t, threat|ened to appeal to the Publick; but on cooler reflection was always aver&s;e to &s;uch a proceeding; and it is not without the greate&s;t regret that I am now driven to publi&s;h letters, and lay open conver&s;ation. The reader indeed will immediately perceive that they are not &s;uch as pa&s;s between friend and friend; or, if they were, that I have not been the aggre&s;&s;or in this in&s;tance. My letters have been &s;ubmitted by my profe&s;t adver&s;aries to Coun&s;el, and the mo&s;t ca&s;ual expre&s;&s;ions dropt carele&s;sly in the flow of <HI>table-talk</HI> have been urged again&s;t me as &s;olemn re&s;olutions. The&s;e very letters and conver&s;ations are al&s;o the ba&s;is of the black charges brought again&s;t me; &s;o that I do but meet the Libeller on his own ground; on which, if he u&s;es the arms of Fal&s;hood for the attack, I have certainly a right to have recour&s;e to Truth for my &s;hield.</P>

<HEAD>A TRUE STATE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the latter end of la&s;t March, Mr. Powell de&s;ired to &s;peak with me on particular bu&s;ine&s;s, and acquainted me that a couple of gentlemen had applied to him to become a joint purcha&s;er with them of the patents, &amp;c. of Covent-Garden Theatre; that he could never think of embarking in &s;uch an undertaking with two inexperienced young men, who perhaps might know but little of the world, and cer|tainly could know nothing of the internal management of a Theatre; that he had not &s;ufficient confidence in his own abilities to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf equal to the ta&s;k; but that, if he had my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he did not doubt of &s;ucce&s;s; concluding with a reque&s;t of my permi&s;&s;ion to mention me to the two gentlemen, and at the &s;ame time declaring, that, unle&s;s I were included in the treaty, he &s;hould decline the propo&s;al, fearing it might terminate in his ruin.</P>
<P>Mr. Powell, with my con&s;ent, mentioned my name to the gentlemen. They objected to taking in a fourth; but Mr. Powell declared his opi|nion, that they would reap more profit from a fourth &s;hare with Mr. Colman's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than from a third without him.</P>
<P>A few days after, on another interview between Mr. Powell and the gentlemen, they told him that they had con&s;idered of his la&s;t propo&s;al; in con&s;equence whereof they had made proper enquiries concerning Mr. Colman, and found his acce&s;&s;ion to the partner&s;hip &s;o de&s;irable a circum|&s;tance, that they returned Mr. Powell many thanks for making &s;o happy an improvement of their plan, and de&s;ired to have a meeting on the oc|ca&s;ion with Mr. Colman as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16">
Accordingly, on the thirtieth of March, all the four par|ties met at Mr. Powell's. Mr. Colman being a&s;ked by Me&s;&s;. <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 30. 1767.</NOTE> Rutherford and Harris, whether he had con&s;idered of the af|fair which Mr. Powell had at their de&s;ire communicated to him, replied, that he thought him&s;elf much obliged to Mr. Powell for his good opi|nion, but could not think of availing him&s;elf of &s;uch a partiality, unle&s;s they concurred in Mr. Powell's &s;entiments; and that if they were not of opinion that Mr. Colman's advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance were e&s;&s;ential to the wel|fare of the undertaking, he would by no means think of becoming a party concerned merely from the nomination of Mr. Powell. Their reply to this declaration was conceived in the mo&s;t hand&s;ome terms; and, to con|vince Mr. Colman that the many civil things they &s;aid on this occa&s;ion were not words of cour&s;e, they afterwards recurred to this &s;ubject, and repeatedly a&s;&s;ured him of the great value they &s;et upon his acce&s;&s;ion to their &s;cheme, independent of every other con&s;ideration than their tho|rough per&s;ua&s;ion of the advantage that would re&s;ult from it in the &s;ucce&s;s of the Theatre. Being late, it was agreed, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation on the intended purcha&s;e, that <HI>the four</HI> &s;hould have a &s;econd meeting the very next night, in order to come to a final determination, and to enter into articles of agreement among them&s;elves concerning the purcha&s;e. Ju&s;t before their parting, Mr. Colman, addre&s;&s;ing Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford, ob&s;erved, that managing a Theatre was like &s;tirring a fire, which every man thought he could do better than any body el&s;e. <Q>&startq;Now, gentlemen, &s;aid he, I think I &s;tir a fire better than any man in England.&endq;</Q> <Q>To this they replied, &startq;Do you manage; let Mr. Powell act; all we want is to have good intere&s;t for our money.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The next evening we met again; and, at the de&s;ire of Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris, Mr. Hutchin&s;on, a gentleman whom <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 31.</NOTE> they particularly recommended for his abilities and integrity in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, attended with an in&s;trument prepared for us to &s;ign. By this agreement, Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris were empowered to treat for the purcha&s;e of the Theatre, &amp;c. at any &s;um not exceeding 60,000l. forty thou&s;and to be rai&s;ed by them&s;elves, and twenty by Colman and Powell, whom they were to a&s;&s;i&s;t with a loan of 5000 l. each, to make up their proportions of the purcha&s;e-money. On Mr. Hutchin|&s;on's reading over this in&s;trument, when he came to that part of it wherein it was recited, that the four parties <HI>&s;hould be jointly and equally concerned in the management of the Theatre,</HI> Mr. Colman begged leave to interrupt him, and told him it was a &s;ettled point that he (Mr. Colman) was to be inve&s;ted with the direction of the Theatre; whereupon, to his very great &s;urpri&s;e, Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford declared, that they never had the lea&s;t intention of forming &s;uch an article; that, as they had
<PB N="13" REF="17">
the turn of the &s;cale in the purcha&s;e-money, they could not think of low|ering their con&s;equence in the purcha&s;e, &amp;c. Mr. Colman &s;aid, that he took it for granted (as he mo&s;t certainly did) that this matter had been previou&s;ly under&s;tood on all &s;ides; and that he had plainly declared to Mr. Powell, on his fir&s;t application, that he would never be concerned in the purcha&s;e, unle&s;s he &s;hould be inve&s;ted with the theatrical direction. Mr. Powell allowed the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, but <HI>&s;aid nothing in appro|bation of Mr. Colman's claim of the management;</HI> and Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris, &s;eeming &s;en&s;ible of his &s;uperior utility in this province, but unwilling to acknowledge that &s;uperiority under their hands, the agree|ment was at la&s;t &s;igned by each of the four parties, in the form in which it had been originally prepared.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action pa&s;&s;ed on the thirty-fir&s;t of March, though the manu|&s;cript paper exhibited at Slaughter's, as well as the printed Narrative, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es of fallacy that will appear through the whole, place it much later.</P>
<P>The next morning I &s;et out for Bath, where I remained till the third or fourth of May. In the mean time, Me&s;&s;. Harris <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 1.</NOTE> and Rutherford contracted for the purcha&s;e, depo&s;ited 10,000l. and agreed for the payment of the remainder on the en&s;uing fir&s;t of July.</P>
<P>I have been extremely particular in the above relation, becau&s;e I am re&s;olved not to &s;uppre&s;s or di&s;gui&s;e the mo&s;t minute fact, that may &s;eem in the lea&s;t favourable to Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris. For a like rea|&s;on I &s;hall &s;uppre&s;s all my reflections and re&s;olutions declared to particu|lar friends, till I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing tho&s;e gentlemen again, which was not till &s;ome days after my return to town; the &s;ame me|lancholy occa&s;ion that &s;ummoned me from Bath &s;ooner than I <NOTE PLACE="marg">May, 1767.</NOTE> propo&s;ed, having al&s;o &s;ecluded me from company. In the mean time, Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t impatience for an interview with me, <HI>apart from Mr. Powell.</HI> On the very fir&s;t con|ference, they te&s;tified, in the warme&s;t terms, their earne&s;t de&s;ire that I &s;hould be inve&s;ted with the theatrical direction, complaining at the &s;ame time of the indi&s;cretion of Mr. Powell, to whom they a&s;cribed the noto|riety of our intended purcha&s;e, which was now become the common talk of the town, and our names in&s;erted in every news-paper.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to Mr. Powell to declare, that it afterwards appeared that, from the peculiar circum&s;tances of Mr. Rich's will, his widow thought her&s;elf bound in honour to declare to &s;ome other candidates for the purcha&s;e, that &s;he had given notice to the tru&s;tees of her having con|tracted for the &s;ale. This circum&s;tance, as well as the nece&s;&s;ary appli|cations by each of the parties to their friends for the requi&s;ite &s;um, tended to make the treaty publick. One part of Mr. Powell's conduct on this
<PB N="14" REF="18">
occa&s;ion, though it certainly contributed to betray our operations, is very much to his honour, though the written Narrative, with the &s;ame &s;pirit of candour that animates the whole, endeavours to interpret it to his di&s;advantage, and to tax him with a &s;candalous breach of faith to the Patentees of Drury-Lane Theatre. The truth is, that the very day after Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris had applied to Mr. Powell, he com|municated the matter to Mr. Lacey, who very kindly a&s;&s;ured him of his be&s;t wi&s;hes, and a continuance of the &s;ame friend&s;hip which he had &s;hewn to Mr. Powell on every former occa&s;ion. Mr. Garrick was then at Bath.</P>
<P>In a word, Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford now in&s;i&s;ted on the expediency of inve&s;ting Mr. Colman with the direction of <NOTE PLACE="marg">May, 1767.</NOTE> the Theatre, and were extremely &s;ollicitous to &s;ettle this point before Mr. Powell's &s;ummer-engagements &s;hould call him out of town. To this end it was propo&s;ed, that we &s;hould each of us con&s;ider of that and &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary articles, and throw our thoughts concerning them upon paper. I did &s;o; and Mr. Harris, in a few days, took occa|&s;ion to call upon me one morning <HI>alone.</HI> I then &s;ubmitted to him a pa|per containing a &s;ketch of &s;ome articles, and, among the re&s;t, one re|lative to the management, which was as follows:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;That George Colman &s;hall be inve&s;ted with the theatrical direc|tion, that is to &s;ay, the power of engaging and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing actors, ac|tre&s;&s;es, &s;ingers, dancers, mu&s;icians, &amp;c. &amp;c. of receiving or re|jecting &s;uch new pieces as &s;hall be offered to the Theatre; of ca&s;ting the plays; of appointing what plays, farces, &amp;c. &s;hall be performed; together with the &s;ole conduct of all &s;uch things as are generally un|der&s;tood to be comprehended under the dramatick and theatrical pro|vince: <HI>Provided always that the &s;aid George Colman &s;hall not do any act contrary to the opinion of</HI> ANY TWO <HI>of the other partners in writing ex|pre&s;&s;ed: and that if the four partne$s &s;hall be equally divided in opinion, that the matter in di&s;pute &s;hall be referred to two arbitrators, one for each party; and if the &s;aid two arbitrators cannot agree, that they &s;hall join in appointing one other arbitrator, who&s;e opinion &s;hall be deci&s;ive and final.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>On peru&s;ing the above rough draught of an article, Mr. Harris did me the honour to ob&s;erve, that the footing on which I was willing to re&s;t my management was extremely generous, and agreeable to the candour which I had &s;hewn in my whole tran&s;action with them; but that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould have <HI>more power</HI> than &s;uch an article would give me; that he had the greate&s;t e&s;teem and regard for his friend Mr. Rutherford, whom he thought a very hone&s;t, good-natured man, but that there were no two per&s;ons in the world more likely to differ in

opinion than him&s;elf and Mr. Rutherford; &s;o that if Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Powell &s;hould happen to join in oppo&s;ition to any of my mea&s;ures, an ob&s;truction in the management mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue; that his bro|ther-in-law, Mr. Longman, had told him, that he and Mr. Rutherford <HI>might</HI> differ, but that he and Mr. Colman <HI>never could;</HI> he could wi&s;h, therefore, that I would agree to put Mr. Powell entirely out of the que&s;|tion, and to place the whole <HI>negative power</HI> in him&s;elf and Mr. Ruther|ford, and then (added he) <HI>"You will always be &s;ure of</HI> ONE <HI>of us."</HI></P>
<P>Although this &s;cene pa&s;t entirely between Mr Harris and me, yet the truth of it does not re&s;t on my bare a&s;&s;ertion; for I recapitulated all the&s;e circum&s;tances to Mr. Harris &s;ome weeks ago at the Theatre, in the pre|&s;ence of Me&s;&s;rs. Rutherford, Powell, and Hutchin&s;on. He allowed the facts, but added, that he had been mi&s;taken in me. I returned him the compliment.</P>
<P>I fell into the &s;nare, and &s;aid, that if Mr. Powell could be prevailed on to a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch an article, I had no objection to it. Mr. Rutherford, in this in&s;tance, as in every other, implicitly &s;ubmitted to the opinion of Mr. Harris. Mr. Powell, however, &s;hewed <HI>great repugnance</HI> to giving me the direction. On my expo&s;tulating with him alone on this &s;ubject, and reminding him of his fir&s;t application to me, and my declared re&s;o|lutions at that period, he frankly confe&s;&s;ed that <HI>he had been advi&s;ed to the contrary;</HI> but that, on reflection, he returned to his original intentions, and was content to put his fame and fortune into my hands.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>real</HI> hi&s;tory of the article re&s;pecting the manage|ment, which was accordingly &s;igned by all parties on the 14th <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 14.</NOTE> of May, and is as follows:</P>
<P>"WHEREAS Thomas Harris, John Rutherford, George Colman, and William Powell, by certain articles of agreement, dated the 31&s;t Day of March la&s;t, did agree to purcha&s;e of the Repre&s;entatives of John Rich, e&s;q. decea&s;ed, two patents for exhibiting theatrical performances, and the &s;everal lea&s;es of Covent-garden the|atre, and the rooms, buildings, conveniences, furniture, cloaths, &s;cenes, decora|tions, mu&s;ic, entertainments, and all things belonging to the &s;aid Theatre; and the &s;aid Thomas Harris and John Rutherford were thereby authori&s;ed to treat for, and purcha&s;e the &s;ame, at a &s;um not exceeding 60,000 l. and the purcha&s;e-money was to be advanced by the &s;aid parties equally, and they were to become jointly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and intere&s;ted in, the premi&s;&s;es &s;o to be purcha&s;ed, and were to be jointly and equally concerned in the management of the &s;aid Theatre, and were to execute proper deeds and in&s;truments for that purpo&s;e, when the &s;aid purcha&s;e &s;hould be completed. And whereas the &s;aid Thomas Harris and John Rutherford have ac|cordingly contracted and agreed with the repre&s;entatives of the &s;aid John Rich, for the purcha&s;ing of the &s;aid patents, lea&s;es, premi&s;&s;es, and things, at and for the &s;um of 60,000 l. and &s;uch purcha&s;e is to be completed on the fir&s;t of July next: Now the &s;aid &s;everal parties, having peru&s;ed and fully under&s;tanding the purport and contents of the &s;aid contract, do approve of, and confirm the &s;ame. And hav|ing

al&s;o, in con&s;equence thereof, taken into their con&s;ideration the Management of the &s;aid Theatre, they have, for the better and more ea&s;y conducting of the bu&s;ine&s;s thereof, as well as for their joint and equal benefit and advantage, agreed, and do hereby mutually declare and agree, that, notwith&s;tanding any thing contained in the &s;aid agreement already made between the &s;aid parties, the &s;aid George Colman &s;hall be inve&s;ted with the Direction of the &s;aid Theatre in the particulars following, viz. that he &s;hall have the power of engaging and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing performers of all kinds; of receiving or rejecting &s;uch new pieces as &s;hall be offered to the &s;aid theatre, or the proprietors thereof; of ca&s;ting the plays; of appointing what plays, farces, en|tertainments, and other exhibitions, &s;hall be performed; and of conducting all &s;uch things as are generally under&s;tood to be comprehended in the dramatic and theatri|cal province. And that the &s;aid Thomas Harris and John Rutherford &s;hall be de|&s;ired to attend to the comptrolment of the Accounts and Trea&s;ury, relative to the &s;aid theatre. <HI>Provided always, and in as much as the &s;aid Thomas Harris and John Ru|therford will have lei&s;ure to attend to the affairs of the &s;aid theatre, and the &s;aid William Powell is to be engaged as an Actor or Performer upon the Stage (for which purpo&s;e &s;eparate articles are intended to be entered into between him and the other Parties), in which his time and attention will be chiefly employed and taken up, &s;o that he will not be able to apply him&s;elf in managing the bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre; it is therefore hereby further agreed, that the &s;aid George Colman &s;hall, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, communicate and &s;ubmit his conduct, and the mea&s;ures he &s;hall intend to pur&s;ue, unto them the &s;aid Tho|mas Harris and John Rutherford; and in ca&s;e they &s;hall, at any time, &s;ignify their di&s;ap|probation thereof, in writing, unto the &s;aid George Colman, then and in that ca&s;e the mea|&s;ures, &s;o di&s;approved of, &s;hall not be carried into execution, any thing before contained to the contrary thereof notwith&s;tanding.

<P>It was at the time of the above conference that Mr. Harris fir&s;t men|tioned Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ire that &s;he might be engaged at our Theatre; but at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting that <HI>I would not be alarmed</HI> on this occa&s;ion, as he did not wi&s;h to have her con&s;idered with more partiality than any other Performer, either in regard to the allot|ment of Parts, or proportion of Salary. I very readily acquie&s;ced in re|ceiving her, provided &s;he could, with any propriety, di&s;entangle her&s;elf from her engagements at Drury Lane; and even declared a propen&s;ity to &s;hew her any rea&s;onable partiality, which I did not doubt was all that would be required.</P>
<P>On the 28th of May was &s;igned another Article, chiefly relative to Mr. Powell's engagement as a Performer, of which <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 28.</NOTE> more &s;hall be &s;aid in the &s;equel. By the &s;ame Article it was al&s;o agreed, that none of the parties &s;hould be concerned in any other Theatre; and
<PB N="17" REF="21">
that any of them producing any new Play, Farce, Entertainment, or other exhibition, or any alteration of an old Play, Farce, &amp;c. &s;hould have the common emoluments accruing to Authors from &s;uch productions, exclu&s;ive of the other parties.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of July the contract with Mr. Rich's executors was compleated, and the money then paid; but in order to ef|fect <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1.</NOTE> the purcha&s;e, the &s;um of Fifteen Thou&s;and Pounds had been bor|rowed, viz. <HI>Six</HI> Thou&s;and for Mr. Rutherford, <HI>Five</HI> for Mr. Colman, and <HI>Four</HI> for Mr. Powell; for &s;ecuring which &s;um of Fifteen Thou&s;and Pounds the three fourth &s;hares of Me&s;&s;rs. Rutherford, Harris, and Colman, were mortgaged, Mr. Powell having made over the fir&s;t claim on the whole of his &s;hare to the per&s;on of whom he had borrowed the other Eleven Thou&s;and of his proportion of the purcha&s;e. By this account it will appear, that Me&s;&s;rs. Harris and Rutherford were not called upon to make good their original contract; that Mr. Powell rai&s;ed One Thou&s;and Pounds more than his contract required; that Mr. Colman was not obliged to them, directly or indirectly, for a &s;ingle &s;hilling; that he was a joint &s;ecurity with them for the Four Thou&s;and advanced to Mr. Powell, and that Mr. Colman rai&s;ed, independent of the patent &s;ecurity, One Thou&s;and Pounds more than Mr. Rutherford, who brought but <HI>Nine</HI> Thou&s;and into the common &s;tock to Mr. Colman's <HI>Ten.</HI> It will &s;carcely be con|tended that Mr. Colman could not rai&s;e 5000l. on his &s;hare; at lea&s;t it cannot be urged with a good grace by Me&s;&s;rs. Harris and Rutherford, who often a&s;&s;ured him how much more ea&s;ily the money was rai&s;ed by the u&s;e of his name: not that the&s;e particulars would be worth mention|ing, if it were not to &s;hew that there is not the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tance in this whole tran&s;action, wherein the writer of the libellous Narrative has not attempted to deceive.</P>
<P>The purcha&s;e being completed, Mr. Powell, who came up to town on purpo&s;e to &s;ign the writings, returned to Bri&s;tol; <NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and Me&s;&s;rs. Rutherford and Harris &s;et out on a tour of plea&s;ure to Buxton, Matlock, Harrowgate, &amp;c. leaving all the care of preparing the Hou&s;e and Company for the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on to Mr. Colman. Before their depar|ture Mr. Colman &s;hewed Mr. Harris a paper containing a &s;ketch of the alterations then propo&s;ed in the Company, and lamented the want of his and Mr. Rutherford's and Mr. Powell's a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice in the cour&s;e of his future operations during the &s;ummer; on which occa&s;ion Mr. Har|ris, with much politene&s;s and apparent &s;incerity, replied, that it was of no con&s;equence, &s;ince they &s;hould have nothing to do but to approve what he propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The many cares attending my new &s;ituation are not ea&s;ily imagined; but I was embarked on a &s;ea of troubles, and was <NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE>
<PB N="18" REF="22">
re&s;olved to make way, if po&s;&s;ible, with chearfulne&s;s and re&s;olution. Af|ter a mo&s;t laborious and unwearied attention to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the The|atre for &s;ix or &s;even weeks, having &s;ettled every thing in the be&s;t manner I was able, I went down to Bri&s;tol, and communicated all my proceedings to Mr. Powell, who expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction at the mea&s;ures I had taken. In about three weeks I returned to London, expecting to meet the two other gentlemen returned from the North, and to find them in the &s;ame good humour which they maintained before they &s;et out.</P>
<P>In this, however, I was cruelly deceived. They received me in the colde&s;t manner, and in&s;tead of &s;eeming &s;en&s;ible of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> trouble I had taken, broke out into complaints of their not having been made duly acquainted with all my proceedings. The only material &s;teps I had taken, were the receiving a Comedy of Dr. Gold&s;mith, and making an engagement with Mr. Macklin; neither of which, e&s;pecially the latter, I &s;hould have done merely on my own judgment, had it not been almo&s;t next to impo&s;&s;ible to have obtained their opinion; as their motions were quite uncertain, and I never received a letter from either of them, till a few days before I went to Bri&s;tol. Of the&s;e mea&s;ures, however, they declared their entire approbation; but before we parted, Mr. Ruther|ford took a fre&s;h occa&s;ion to differ with me, and rendered a very trivial concern a matter of great importance, <HI>by peremptorily in&s;i&s;ting</HI> that the ar|rangements which I had made in that in&s;tance &s;hould not be pur&s;ued. What rendered this unexpected oppo&s;ition the more &s;hocking to me, was, that it was introduced by ob&s;ervations rather unfavourable to the re&s;t of my conduct, for which I was weak enough to expect a very different re|turn. Mr. Rutherford continued to <HI>in&s;i&s;t</HI> on my waving the point, which at that time was not only unadvi&s;able, but impracticable. I profe&s;&s;ed, therefore, that I &s;hould mo&s;t &s;teadily adhere to it; and on tho&s;e terms we parted.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to Mr. Harris to declare, that he acted with the utmo&s;t candour on this occa&s;ion. He undertook to be a mediator, and u&s;ed every method to conciliate the mind of each party. At length Mr. Rutherford was prevailed on to wave his oppo&s;ition, by the interpo&s;ition of his friend, and the following letter from me.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>To</HI> J. RUTHERFORD, <HI>E&s;q.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 8, 1767.</NOTE></P>
<P>The charges of my forbidding them the &s;tage on the fir&s;t rehear&s;al, and neglecting to introduce them to the performers, if they did not be|tray a &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition to jealou&s;y and ill humour, would &s;carce de&s;erve notice. All I can &s;ay is, that I never intended to give them the lea&s;t offence, or to be deficient in any due attention to them; nor did they them&s;elves at that time &s;eem to entertain &s;uch &s;u&s;picions: for it was on the &s;tage that Mr. Rutherford and I fir&s;t met after the above little dif|ference: it was on the &s;tage that he took me by the hand, a&s;&s;uring me that he was perfectly &s;atisfied, and how ardently he de&s;ired the continua|tion of a good under&s;tanding between us: to which I was &s;o &s;incerely inclined, that I concealed the whole tran&s;action from Mr. Powell; and the curtain drew up on the 14th of September, with &s;eeming content on all &s;ides, and the mo&s;t entire harmony in the cabinet of the four kings of Brentford.</P>
<P>The above difference, however, proved to be a prologue to the &s;cenes of di&s;putes that were to &s;ucceed. A day or two after <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> our opening the Theatre, I found the two gentlemen there together, and Mr. Harris, to my great &s;urprize, in very ill humour. On enquiring the cau&s;e, he &s;aid that an in&s;ult had been offered to Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham; concerning which he would make no farther enquiry, as he <HI>would not know</HI> from whom it proceeded. That lady having been engaged on the recommendation of Mr. Harris, I verily believe that Mr. Powell, as well as my&s;elf, was inclined to treat her not only with re&s;pect, but even with partiality, as far as it could be con&s;i&s;tent with the general intere&s;t. I ventured therefore to vouch thus much, and de&s;ired to know the pre|&s;ent matter of complaint, which proved to be her having been a&s;&s;igned a dre&s;&s;ing-room up &s;tairs. I told him that this was the fir&s;t word I had ever heard of it: that my attendance on matters merely dramatick and theatrical, was more than &s;ufficient bu&s;ine&s;s for me; and that the care of dre&s;&s;ing-rooms, ward-robe, &amp;c. had been kindly undertaken by Mr. and Mrs. Powell. Upon this he took me apart, and repeated his ex|pre&s;&s;ions of di&s;&s;atisfaction with more warmth than before. My &s;econd an&s;wer was no other than the fir&s;t; whereupon Mr. Harris in &s;ome mea|&s;ure turned the conver&s;ation, by de&s;iring that Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham might have the part of Imogen. I told him that, as the Ca&s;t Book then &s;tood, it was allotted to Mi&s;s Ward. He &s;aid that Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham could play it as well. I did not deny but &s;he might; adding, that all the bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="24">
then a&s;&s;igned to Mi&s;s Ward mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be merely on &s;uppo|&s;ition; for that as I had never &s;een her play, &s;he might perhaps upon trial appear unfit for it; and that I had given her the part of Imogen, merely on account of the youth and innocence of her figure, which I thought very &s;uitable to the character. I added at the &s;ame time, that, as a friend to Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, I would advi&s;e her never to play a line of Tragedy. This Mr. Harris in &s;ome mea&s;ure allowed, but did not &s;eem to think Imogen &s;o much out of her &s;phere as Belvidera, and &s;ome other tragick characters. I mentioned al&s;o, that as Mr. Powell had a capital part in the play, it would be but a rea&s;onable attention to him, to con|&s;ult how far it would be agreeable to him to ca&s;t the play in that manner: but Mr. Harris &s;aw no occa&s;ion for Mr. Powell's concurrence. This was all that pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject; and this was the only time that ever the name of Mi&s;s Ward was mentioned for the part of Imogen; nor was it then agitated on either &s;ide as a matter of contention between <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 16.</NOTE> her and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham. From this circum&s;tance the Publick may de|termine of the confidence that is due to the libellous author of the writ|ten Narrative; wherein, for obvious rea&s;ons, mean as they are ba&s;e, that young actre&s;s is brought forward as the object of di&s;pute. It is to be hoped, however, that the&s;e wicked in&s;inuations, fal&s;e as they are &s;candalous, will not contribute to throw a &s;tain on the character of a young actre&s;s, <HI>who&s;e conduct has</HI> not only <HI>ever been mo&s;t unexceptionable in</HI> THE THEATRE, but every-where el&s;e.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame period that the arrangement of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham's dre&s;&s;ing-room was taken into con&s;ideration by Mr. Harris, his friend Mr. Rutherford took upon him to promi&s;e a &s;eparate dre&s;&s;ing-room for Mrs. Bellamy. Mr. and Mrs. Powell remon&s;trated concerning the great want of room behind the &s;cenes to no purpo&s;e. Mr. Rutherford &s;aid he had pro|mi&s;ed; and if it co&s;t him <HI>500l.</HI> to build new rooms, it mu&s;t be done. In a word, both the ladies were obliged, and both the gentlemen were &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>On Friday, Sept. 18, the Prompter &s;urprized me, by acquaint|ing me that Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham had returned the part of Neri&s;&s;a in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> the Merchant of Venice; and my &s;urprize was redoubled a few hours after, by his putting into my hands the following letter:</P>

Piqued at the &s;tudied in&s;olence of this epi&s;tle, but unwilling to re|&s;ent it on account of the quarter from which it proceeded, I &s;ubmitted the letter that very evening to Mr. Harris, who defended the propriety of it in &s;uch terms as led me to &s;peak my thoughts very freely, both of the letter and its author. This was very highly re&s;ented by Mr. Harris, by who&s;e privity I then took it for granted the letter had been &s;ent; and I have &s;ince &s;een no rea&s;on to alter my opinion.

<P>Here was an open act of ho&s;tility; an act &s;o far from endeavouring to extenuate the in&s;olence of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, that it was plainly calcu|lated to convince me that they were both determined on every occa&s;ion to countenance and &s;upport it. My an&s;wer, &s;ent the &s;ame morning, was as follows:</P>

<P>"WITHOUT dwelling on the very gro&s;s treatment which I have received from your&s;elves and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, I &s;hall beg leave to remind you, that while you have been con&s;piring to check my authority, you have exceeded the limits of your own. The article of agreement betwixt us, which inve&s;ted me with the theatrical management, empowered you jointly to object to my mea&s;ures, but not to pre&s;cribe new ones of your own; and from the director of the theatre, to &s;ink me into &s;omething lower than the prompter. You will find therefore, that in making era&s;ements from the Ca&s;t Book, and &s;igning a li&s;t of parts allotted to Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, you have as little attended to the propriety you profe&s;s, as to the re&s;pect due to</P>

<P>This an&s;wer was, I believe, the fir&s;t circum&s;tance that &s;erved to waken them from the trance of de&s;poti&s;m, into which their con&s;truction of the article relative to the management had thrown them. A <HI>negative</HI> power it left them, but gave them no <HI>po&s;itive</HI> one. They told me indeed at our next meeting, that two negatives made one affirmative. I allowed the truth of that logick; but told them, that <HI>both together,</HI> like the two letters in the word NO, they made but <HI>one</HI> negative. I taxed Mr. Rutherford al&s;o with want of candor on this occa&s;ion, for joining to in&s;ult me without &s;o much as inquiring into the merits of the cau&s;e; re|minding
<PB N="23" REF="27">
him, at the &s;ame time, of the oppo&s;ite conduct of his friend on a former occa&s;ion. Mr. Harris then told me, he found I was an im|practicable man, and de&s;ired, or rather injoined me to put my &s;hare to &s;ale. Mr. Powell, who till then had only lamented our divi&s;ions in &s;ilence, was &s;tartled at this propo&s;al, and frankly confe&s;t that he thought &s;uch proceeding was injurious to our common intere&s;t. I told Mr. Harris that, finding I was become &s;o di&s;agreeable a partner to him&s;elf and Mr. Rutherford, I &s;hould retain my &s;hare, on purpo&s;e to plague them. It was, I think, at this meeting, and on this occa&s;ion, that Mr. Ruther|ford dwelling very much on the words <HI>manly</HI> and <HI>gentleman-like,</HI> I took occa&s;ion to tell him, in a carele&s;s manner, that I had never in my life heard tho&s;e words &s;o often repeated; but that I did not need his in&s;truc|tion how to behave either like a man or a gentleman. His reply to this was very violent, and ended with talking of <HI>going out with him,</HI> accom|panying the&s;e la&s;t words with a &s;tride towards the door. I told him I thought it rather extraordinary, that he was not contented with giving the affront, if any had been given; but that he al&s;o claimed the pri|vilege of re&s;entment: however, that if he &s;uppo&s;ed I was to be terrified, he was mi&s;taken.&mdash;They then recurred to the paper in di&s;pute, and a&s;ked if the li&s;t of parts contained in it &s;hould be con&s;idered as admi&s;&s;ible. I objected to all the tragedy, particularly Leonora in the Revenge; and added, that Mrs. Sullen belonged to Mrs Bulkley, and that Mi&s;s Macklin was the original Widow Belmour. They again a&s;ked, if I was inclined to oblige them. I told them my chief cau&s;e of offence was their having doubted that inclination, and having flown to acts of violence when gentle means would have been more prevalent. They then &s;uddenly changed their tone and manner; Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, &s;orely again&s;t my judgment in many in&s;tances, was allowed the characters in que&s;tion; and we parted once more in tolerable good humour.</P>
<P>Such were the expo&s;tulations of Me&s;&s;rs. Harris and Rutherford, and &s;uch were the injuries which I delighted to inflict on their favou|rite actre&s;s. But it &s;eems, that I <HI>had conceived a violent pique and re&s;ent|ment again&s;t her, the cau&s;e of which &s;hall not be here related.</HI> Dark charges mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be darkly an&s;wered; but whenever the lady, or her advocates, &s;hall plea&s;e to be more explicit, I promi&s;e to <HI>&s;peak plainly</HI> in my an&s;wer, if &s;he, or they, &s;hall urge any thing of &s;ufficient importance to demand one at my hands.</P>
<P>I allow the charge of employing <HI>news-papers to defend gro&s;s partiali|ties</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Me&s;&s;. R. and H.'s Narrative, p. 37.</NOTE>; for I was weak enough to mention Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham's having joined us, with the air of announcing a valuable acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;trength of our company, by &s;pecial paragraphs in the public papers. I mu&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="28">
al&s;o plead guilty to the charge of <HI>forcing unpopular performers on a patient audience</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Me&s;&s;. R. and H.'s Narrative, p. 37.</NOTE>; for on the fir&s;t night of her appearance, to prevent the morti|&s;ication that her vanity mu&s;t &s;uffer from a thin hou&s;e, in direct oppo&s;i|tion to the opinion of Mr. Macklin, I &s;upported her lame performance on the crutches of Love A-la Mode. I al&s;o prefixed the Stratagem, in which &s;he played Mrs. Sullen, to the Oxonian in Town, while its no|velty was &s;ome recommendation to it. I had the more merit in the&s;e &s;acrifices, becau&s;e they were made in direct contradiction to my private opinion. In the la&s;t in&s;tance, two &s;trong objections to the mea&s;ure I pur&s;ued, &s;tared me in the face: fir&s;t, that &s;he played the part mo&s;t wretchedly; and, &s;econdly, that it was apparently injurious to a little piece, e&s;pecially one of &s;o &s;erious a ca&s;t, to be performed after one of the lighte&s;t and plea&s;ante&s;t comedies in our language.</P>
<P>But to return. From the moment after our meeting in con&s;e|quence of their memorable letter of September 19th, Me&s;&s;rs. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> Harris and Rutherford expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction at the conce&s;|&s;ions which I &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to make, and were ince&s;&s;antly urging me to bring forward the play of Cymbeline, a&s;&s;igning as a motive, the ve|ry rea&s;on which they now urge for oppo&s;ing the repetition of it, viz. that <HI>it was frequently exhibited at Drury Lane</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 6.</NOTE>. Mr. Powell al&s;o, being extremely attached to the character of Po&s;thumus, was de&s;irous of &s;how|ing him&s;elf in it, whoever might play Imogen. In this &s;ituation I could not have avoided exhibiting the play, however aver&s;e, without di&s;oblig|ing them all three, if Mr. Dall had not received orders to paint a new &s;cene of Imogen's chamber; a &s;cene which has &s;ince given the public &s;o much &s;atisfaction, but which then nece&s;&s;arily delayed the performance of the piece, into which it was to be introduced. Hence it will appear, that Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, without any competition, had been avowedly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the part from the 19th of September, that is, within a week of opening the Theatre. On the 12th of October Mr. and Mrs. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct.</NOTE> Yates were engaged, the hi&s;tory of which tran&s;action &s;hall be given in its proper place. From that in&s;tant, I confe&s;s, that all my notions of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham's playing the part in que&s;tion vani&s;hed; for I could never &s;uppo&s;e, that Me&s;&s;rs. Rutherford and Harris would be &s;o blind to their own intere&s;ts, or that Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham would entertain &s;uch an overweening opinion of her own abilities, as to think of her entering in|to a direct competition with Mrs. Yates. However, I was &s;oon unde|ceived; for on Thur&s;day the 29th of October, they roundly in&s;i&s;ted on Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham's retaining the character, which I as roundly refu&s;ed; but not without remon&s;trating on the gro&s;s partiality that would appear in &s;uch a procedure; as well as the inju&s;tice to Mrs. Yates, and the af|front
<PB N="25" REF="29">
to the public; for all which my reputation, <HI>and chiefly mine,</HI> would &s;uffer. They treated the&s;e arguments with great contempt; upon which, finding nothing but further altercation likely to en&s;ue, I abrupt|ly left them; but I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare, that I did not then, or at any other time, <HI>openly and avowedly di&s;claim their right to lay me under any re&s;traint;</HI> nor did I <HI>declare, that I would never di&s;clo&s;e to them any of my future intentions.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Me&s;&s;. R. and H. 's Narrative, p. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>They were re&s;olved, however, to carry this important point, if po&s;&s;ible; and finding the <HI>acting manager</HI> inflexible, they not only tampered with Mr. Powell, but applied to Mrs. Yates, with whom they had a very long conference, in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, that very evening, as will ap|pear from the following letter, which they &s;ent about an hour after they took their leave; and from which, together with Mrs. Yates's an&s;wer, it is not difficult to gue&s;s at the nature and &s;ubject of the conference it&s;elf.</P>

<P>This an&s;wer was received by Me&s;&s;rs.

<P>Mr. Powell, quite unhappy to &s;ee our differences running to &s;uch a length, and de&s;irous to do every thing in his power to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1.</NOTE> heal them, prevailed on a very intimate friend of mine, to accompany him the next morning to confer with Me&s;&s;rs.

<P>Mr. Powell, finding their violence impo&s;&s;ible to be mi|tigated, and thinking our property in the greate&s;t danger from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1.</NOTE> their method of proceeding, now, for the fir&s;t time, declared on my &s;ide: and fore&s;eeing the tumult likely to en&s;ue, from the &s;teps which Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris had declared their re&s;olutions of taking the next morning, thought it advi&s;able to prevent that confu&s;ion as far as po&s;&s;ible, by collecting as many of the performers as could be found that day, and laying before them a fair &s;tate of the ca&s;e. On this occa&s;ion I related the &s;tory in the plaine&s;t terms, read the letters which authenti|cated my narrative, and <HI>fairly &s;tated</HI> the article relative to the manage|ment, reciting the <HI>negative power</HI> lodged with Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris, as well as the <HI>po&s;itive</HI> one ve&s;ted in me. <HI>Read</HI> the article, indeed, I could not, as I then had no copy of it. For the truth of the&s;e circum|&s;tances, I appeal to all the parties then pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next morning the tumult, &s;o vehemently threatened on their part, and patiently expected on our own, actually en&s;ued. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> About eleven o'clock Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford came on the &s;tage, and interrupted the rehear&s;al. They a&s;ked me, in an authoritative tone, if I had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Mr. Younger? I an&s;wered, No.&mdash;Will you di&s;mi&s;s him? No.&mdash;Some time after this, Mr. Rutherford &s;aid, <HI>Did not we</HI> ORDER you <HI>to di&s;mi&s;s Younger?&mdash;</HI>ORDER me, <HI>Sir!&mdash;</HI>He immediately recanted the imperious word <HI>order,</HI> and was polite enough to &s;ub&s;titute the gentler term <HI>de&s;ire.</HI> He read the article in an audible voice on the &s;tage to the performers, and afterwards a&s;ked them if they would conti|nue to act under Mr. Colman's management. They an&s;wered, YES.
<PB N="30" REF="34">
Mr. Rutherford, mi&s;under&s;tanding Mr. Smith, and &s;uppo&s;ing that he meant to a&s;&s;ent to <HI>their</HI> direction, &s;aid with great heat, <HI>I am obliged to you, Sir; you are a gentleman.</HI> Mr. Smith, however, being a&s;ked by another performer to <HI>what</HI> he had an&s;wered <HI>yes,</HI> &s;aid, that his YES implied an a&s;&s;ent to act under Mr. Colman. <HI>Why then, gentlemen,</HI> &s;aid Mr. Ruther|ford, <HI>I will tell you one thing for your comfort; the Theatre will be &s;hut up, for we &s;hall apply to the court of chancery for an injunction for that purpo&s;e.</HI> Soon after the&s;e tran&s;actions, Mrs. Mattocks fainted away, and I ran among others into the common Green-Room to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. During my ab&s;ence, a difference aro&s;e between my friend and Mr. Rutherford, in confequence whereof he and Mr. Harris left the &s;tage, to which I returned a few &s;econds before their retiring to the great Green-Room.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than half an hour, Mr. Powell came and told me, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> that Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford were inclined to a reconci|liation, if I would but con&s;ent to the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Younger for five minutes. I replied, that provided his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be <HI>literally</HI> for five minutes, I would a&s;&s;ent to it, &s;ince they thought the form &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ave appearances. I own I did not &s;ee why they were &s;o well inclined to terms of peace, which they &s;o peremptorily refu&s;ed the morning before; but being very deeply affected at the part <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> which my friend had taken in this affair, I was willing to do every thing in my power to promote a thorough reconciliation on all &s;ides. Accordingly I accompanied Mr. Powell into the great Green-Room; and being a&s;ked by Mr. Harris <HI>whether I would carry on the ma|nagement without doing any thing contrary to the article?</HI> I replied, to the be&s;t of my knowledge and belief, in the&s;e words: <HI>I never</HI> DID <HI>any thing contrary to the article: I never</HI> MEANT <HI>to do any thing contrary to our arti|cle. All I de&s;ire is to manage according to the article, and to have an unin|terrupted exerci&s;e of the power which the article gives me.</HI> Me&s;&s;. Wood|ward, Smith, Gib&s;on, &amp;c. were pre&s;ent: to them I appeal for the truth of this relation; and to them I appeal whether <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the printed Narrative, p. 11.</NOTE> <HI>I apparently took &s;hame to my&s;elf</HI> on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, however, pre&s;erved the decorums of re&s;entment to the la&s;t, and thought it nece&s;&s;ary, on the very moment of our reconci|liation, to commit a fre&s;h violation of the article in que&s;tion, by writing the following note to the trea&s;urer of the Theatre:</P>

A reconciliation being thus effected, Mr. Harris de&s;ired, that as the play of Cymbeline had been &s;o much the object of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> conver&s;ation and di&s;pute, it might be laid a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent. Accord|ingly it was &s;o; and the appearance of a good under&s;tanding among us was once more re&s;tored. But it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford pre&s;erved the&s;e appearances; for, in&s;tead of each of them favouring me with their advice in a friendly manner, they were continually &s;ending me letters formally &s;igned by them both. This was &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to their profe&s;&s;ions, that I expo&s;tulated with Mr. Harris on the &s;ubject, and told him, that I was in hopes we were now to have gone on as friends, without recurring, in every little in&s;tance, to the article, and reminding each other of the extent and limits of our re|&s;pective power; but that if I &s;aw him and his friend re&s;olved to drive me, on every occa&s;ion, to the ground of the article, I would &s;tand on that ground, and defend it to the la&s;t; for that I very well knew how much and how little power that article gave me. Mr. Harris replied, that we had all ju&s;t power enough to plague each other; and, to convince me that he might ea&s;ily be induced to exerci&s;e that power on his part, he added, that the breach between us had been &s;o very wide, that it would not readily clo&s;e again, without the mo&s;t &s;incere de&s;ires and en|deavours on all &s;ides. I profe&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t readine&s;s to promote &s;o de&s;irable an end; but the gentlemen were &s;o little inclined to meet me half-way, that they &s;till continued the &s;ame mode of behaviour which had led me to the above-mentioned expo&s;tulation. In &s;hort, I plainly &s;aw that they never would forget or forgive the tran&s;actions of the &s;econd of November.</P>
<P>About the latter end of that month, while things were in this &s;ituation, Mr. Dall had fini&s;hed the &s;cene intended for Cymbe|line. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Novemb.</NOTE> This redoubled Mr. Powell's impatience and anxiety to exhibit the play; and he applied to Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford (particularly the former) in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive terms, to wave their ob|jections to it. Mr. Harris was inexorable; Mr. Rutherford &s;aid, that we ought not to perform it <HI>without a&s;king Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham's leave;</HI> and referred the farther con&s;ideration of it to our next meeting.</P>
<P>One little occurrence, that happened about this time, will perhaps &s;hew the temper and complexion of the&s;e gentlemen, more than a matter of more con&s;equence. The prompter had orders to &s;end them every evening an account of the rehear&s;al &s;ettled for the next morning, and at the end of every week a plan of my arrangement of plays for the week en&s;uing. One of the&s;e notes was as follows:</P>

The next day I met them at the Theatre, and fairly told <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10.</NOTE> them, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to proceed in the ma|nagement, while they &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to take every occa&s;ion to make me unea&s;y; that Cymbeline was in the li&s;t of plays &s;ubmitted to his maje&s;ty at the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on; but to convince them that I did not want to carry any points but &s;uch as were conducive to the ge|neral intere&s;t, which I had always meant to pur&s;ue, I was re&s;olved to refer my conduct to tho&s;e who had embarked their property with us, and to their own friends in particular; that it was a wanton piece of cruelty to be perpetually trying to make my mind mi&s;erable, when my labours rather de&s;erved their thanks; that I had been a voluntary &s;lave in the conduct of their property; but that I was extremely hurt on their &s;eeming inclined to treat me like a &s;ervant in every particular, except that of paying me wages.</P>
<P>They received this expo&s;tulation on my part with more temper and moderation than u&s;ual. They declared that they had repeatedly, and on all occa&s;ions, profe&s;&s;ed how much they thought them&s;elves obliged to me; and no longer in&s;i&s;ted on my repre&s;enting to their Maje&s;ties that we could not obey their Royal Commands re&s;pecting the exhibition of Cymbeline. Mr. Rutherford, a day or two after, lamented the little bickering at this meeting, profe&s;&s;ing the warme&s;t cordiality towards me on his &s;ide, and vouching for the &s;ame &s;entiments on behalf of his friend Mr. Harris.</P>
<P>The rehear&s;als of Cymbeline were then continued without <NOTE PLACE="marg">Decemb.</NOTE> farther interruption or remon&s;trance; and on Monday the twenty-eighth of December the repre&s;entation of the play was honoured with the pre&s;ence of their Maje&s;ties; after who&s;e departure the plays, as u&s;ual, were announced, and, among the re&s;t, Cymbeline <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 28.</NOTE> again for the &s;ucceeding Thur&s;day, which occa&s;ioned the fol|lowing notes:</P>
<P>Monday Evening, 10 o'clock, Dec. 28th.</P>
<P>"MR. HARRIS and Mr. Rutherford pre&s;ent compliments to Mr. Colman.&mdash;Are much concerned that he directed Cymbeline to be given out this evening. Mr. Colman is well acquainted with their &s;entiments on that &s;ubject, and how much it is their de&s;ire that Cymbeline &s;hould for the pre&s;ent be po&s;tponed. They doubt not he will conduct this circum&s;tance accordingly."</P>
<P>"MR. COLMAN pre&s;ents his compliments to Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford, and is equally concerned and &s;urprized at their repugnance to the repetition of Cymbe|line; which is the more unexpected, as he mentioned to Mr. Harris his intention to have given it out for the next night, had it not been for the indi&s;po&s;ition of Mr. Powell. He flatters him&s;elf they mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to acknowledge the de|licacy which has been u&s;ed towards them in this point. As this play had unhappily been the cau&s;e of di&s;&s;en&s;ion, it was laid a&s;ide for a time, and at length re&s;umed and
<PB N="35" REF="39">
performed by the expre&s;s command of their Maje&s;ties; to who&s;e royal orders it would appear an indirect affront, to di&s;continue a performance, &s;o likely to redound to the intere&s;t and credit of the theatre; at the &s;ame time that &s;uch a conduct would be a publick confirmation of the evil reports of di&s;putes among&s;t the managers. From this and many other con&s;iderations which their own good &s;en&s;e will &s;ugge&s;t to them, Mr. Colman flatters him&s;elf, that on cool reflection, they will chearfully concur with him&s;elf and Mr. Powell."</P>
<P>Dec. 29th.</P>
<P>"THE compliments of Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Harris wait on Mr. Colman. It is certain Mr. C. did mention his de&s;ign of giving out Cymbeline to Mr. H. which exceedingly &s;urprized him; but Mr. H. was very happy to hear it was to be deferred, both on account of the hatred he ever bears, and the unwillingne&s;s he ha$ about him always to enter into altercation, and that there would be time to take Mr. R's opinion. The advice of their friends, joined to their coole&s;t reflection, &s;till &s;ugge&s;ts to them the ab&s;olute impropriety of repre&s;enting the play of Cymbe|line again &s;o &s;oon as propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Their united and mo&s;t &s;incere wi&s;hes are, that this little difference may end here, and no more may ever ari&s;e; and that Mr. C. will, in &s;ome degree, pay attention to <HI>their &s;entiments:</HI> &s;eeing <HI>that</HI> will make their happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t in <HI>entirely pur&s;uing</HI> tho&s;e of Mr. C.</P>
<P>Surry &s;treet, Tue&s;day one o'clock.</P>
<P>I was now credibly informed that, during the rehear&s;al of the play, wagers had been laid by &s;ome, who were of their <HI>privy-council,</HI> that Cymbeline would never be performed but <HI>once.</HI> We had been at great expence in the decorations, which were much approved; the play was e&s;teemed a creditable performance; and there was a great demand for places again&s;t any future repre&s;entation of it, not to repeat the duty in|cumbent on us to te&s;tify the utmo&s;t re&s;pect to the Royal Order by which it had been revived at our Theatre. The expences be&s;towed on the play had been incurred with the con&s;ent and approbation of Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford, in whom it was therefore the more unrea&s;onable to preclude our reaping the profits that might re&s;ult from them. It appeared al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible to keep terms with men, who were for ever &s;eeking occa&s;ions of di&s;pute. On the&s;e con&s;iderations I made no reply to the above note, and continued to adverti&s;e the play.</P>

<P><PB N="40" REF="44">
Knowing the unquiet &s;pirits of the writers, I looked upon this letter, as well as that to Mr. Powell, to be nothing more than a fre&s;h <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 2.</NOTE> in&s;ult, that their re&s;entments to me might keep pace with their in&s;tances of &s;pleen to Mr. Powell. I mu&s;t own I never expected to be called on for a ju&s;tification of my character in a tran&s;a$tion of this nature; and I am very well convinced, that the gentlemen them&s;elves never thought of exhibiting &s;o &s;candalous a charge, till after the &s;econd repre|&s;entation of the play of Cymbeline. This, and the other a&s;&s;ertions rela|tive to Mr. Powell's going to Bri&s;tol, as well as the in&s;inuations con|cerning the wardrobe, and Mrs. Yates's engagement, will appear to be the mo&s;t exceptionable parts of Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford's conduct. Pa&s;&s;ion is a human frailty, and therefore in &s;ome degree excu&s;able; but rancour and malice, &s;upported by fal&s;hood, are diabolical.</P>
<P>The affairs of the wardrobe have been already con&s;idered. The matters of King Lear, and Mr. Powell's going to Bri&s;tol in the &s;ummer, were both agitated &s;o long ago as on Thur&s;day the 26th of November, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26.</NOTE> and the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;t was as follows:</P>
<P>I told them that the money ari&s;ing from my night, as author of the Oxonian in Town, lay as yet in the office; but that as I was, by our articles, to be paid for every thing which I did in &s;uch a capacity, I would, if they thought proper, take <HI>the clear receipt</HI> of the hou&s;e that night, as a con&s;ideration for my in&s;ertions in the Rehear&s;al at the opening of the Theatre, and my alteration of King Lear; adding, that the alteration of Lear had given me more trouble than that of Phila&s;ter, for which I had a night at Drury-Lane; but that as it did not ab&s;olutely add a play to our catalogue, and as it was a work I &s;hould never have undertaken had I not been engaged in the direction of a theatre, I &s;hould be very well contented with &s;uch a con&s;ideration for my trouble. They a&s;ked if I had not better refer all tho&s;e matters to the end of the &s;ea&s;on. I replied, with all my heart; that I did not mean to a&s;k it as a favour; but that as I believed I &s;hould do nothing more of that &s;ort this year, and as the money happened to be in the office, tho&s;e circum&s;tances had in|duced me to mention the matter at that time. Mr. Powell declared his opinion, that the demand was a very moderate one, and that he thought I might very rea&s;onably have claimed a night. I &s;aid that, whenever I produced my alteration of the Silent Woman, I &s;hould be undoubtedly en|titled to one for that piece; but in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I &s;hould be very well &s;atisfied with the &s;um then in the office: whereupon it was unani|mou&s;ly agreed, that I &s;hould take out the clear receipt, which amounted to 64 <HI>l.</HI> 5 <HI>s.</HI> more than was due to me as author of the Oxonian in Town. The above letter, in&s;olent as it is, does not deny my having been <HI>paid</HI> by their con&s;ent; but it is particularly happy for me, that Mr. Hutchin&s;on,
<PB N="41" REF="45">
a gentleman who&s;e integrity has heretofore extorted even their approha|tion, was pre&s;ent at this &s;cene, and can vouch for the truth of this re|lation.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the invidious note to the printed Narrative <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their Narrative, p. 13.</NOTE>, This is <HI>a cu&s;to|mary liberty taken from time to time with this play in the repre&s;entation: and, particularly, by the celebrated manager of Drury Lane, who, we are a&s;&s;ured, never charged a &s;ingle farthing to his brother patentee for &s;uch &s;er|vices.</HI> If the celebrated manager of Drury Lane had ever attempted to execute my projected plan of altering King Lear, my labours on this occa&s;ion would undoubtedly have been &s;uper&s;eded; <HI>but that he never charged a &s;ingle farthing to his brother patentee for &s;uch &s;ervices</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On a revi&s;al of this page, and a &s;econd reference to their printed Narrative, I find, that their note in p. 13. concerning <HI>the cu&s;tomary liberty taken with this play in repre&s;entation,</HI> alludes to the play of <HI>The Rehear&s;al;</HI> not to King Lear. In that in&s;tance Mr. Shuter, as well as every former <HI>Bays,</HI> took the &s;ame liberty, and charged nothing extraordinary for &s;uch &s;ervices. But the u&s;ual <HI>extempore</HI> plea&s;antries of the actor in this character, are very different in point of quantity, not to &s;ay quality, from tho&s;e written additions which they are plea&s;ed to call <HI>the in&s;ertion of a few liues</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Me&s;&s;. R. and H.'s Narrative, p. 13.</NOTE> How much of the 64l. 5s. Me&s;&s;. R. and H. are plea&s;ed to charge to this account, I cannot tell; but my agreement gave me an undoubted right to receive a con&s;ideration for them: and, few and trifling as they are plea&s;ed to call the&s;e additions, on whatever occa&s;ion they &s;hall produce the like, I will convince them I have not been over-paid.</NOTE>, both he and his brother patentee know to be fal&s;e; and that ju&s;tly celebrated manager him&s;elf, more than once, propo&s;ed to me to join with him in <HI>a reform of the theatre,</HI> wherein tho&s;e pieces which did not require &s;o much alteration as to entitle the new editor to a benefit-night, were to be rewarded <HI>by a certain &s;um</HI> for each play. My revi&s;al of King Lear falls directly under that de&s;cription; and, I believe, the manager him|&s;elf will allow, that I have had no more than a <HI>quantum meruit</HI> for my trouble; nay, I will &s;ubmit to be tried by a theatrical jury, with that manager, as he ever ought to be, at their head; and I will forfeit double the &s;um, if my foreman does not bring me in <HI>not guilty.</HI> That he has been paid for his &s;ervices is mo&s;t certain, as it is mo&s;t certain; that he has been paid no more than he has very fairly earned. He was plea&s;ed to tell me, that I &s;hould find my trouble, as acting-manager, would very well de&s;erve 500 l. a year; and to add, that he would give my partners 500 l. a year, if they would not &s;uffer me to be acting-manager. The&s;e were his &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ions at that time; but, as Abraham &s;ays in Harlequin's Inva&s;ion, <HI>tho&s;e happy days are over.</HI></P>
<P>The other affair &s;tands thus:</P>
<P>On the 28th of May, when the article relative to Mr. Powell's &s;alary, &amp;c. was &s;igned, when Mr. Hutchin&s;on, who prepared it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 28.</NOTE> fir&s;t read that clau&s;e, wherein it was to be agreed, that <HI>none of the</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="46">
<HI>parties &s;hould, after the fir&s;t of October, act, write, or have any concern in any other theatre,</HI> Mr. Powell ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ign it, alledging the nece&s;&s;ity he &s;hould be under to retain his property at Bri&s;tol, at lea&s;t for &s;ome years, in ju&s;tice both to him&s;elf and his family; who, notwith|&s;tanding the emoluments that might accrue from our intended purcha&s;e, would be extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and pinched in their income, till he had paid off the money, principal as well as intere&s;t, bor|rowed <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 28.</NOTE> on the occa&s;ion. After two or three hours debate, he, with great reluctance, &s;et his hand to the article; and I will venture to &s;ay, that my arguments and warmth on the occa&s;ion induced him to con&s;ent to it. At the &s;ame time, to mark our &s;en&s;e of his compliance in this in|&s;tance, he was promi&s;ed, by Me&s;&s;rs. Harris and Rutherford, as well as my&s;elf, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their printed Narrative, p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>to indemnify him,</HI> in &s;ome mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, <HI>for the lo&s;s he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain by not acting at Bri&s;tol in the &s;ummer,</HI> &s;hould be a matter of our future con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>After the completion of the purcha&s;e, and our opening the theatre, Mr. Powell frequently took occa&s;ion to mention this matter, and de&s;ired to know on what footing this affair was to &s;tand, that he might deter|mine in what manner to conduct him&s;elf, in regard to his connections in Bri&s;tol. Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris, for a long time, found means to evade giving a determinate an&s;wer; but, on the 26th of November, Mr. Powell de&s;iring a categorical an&s;wer, they told him they would give him leave to go to Bri&s;tol; that they had altered their &s;entiments on this head, and conceived the reputation of each patentee to be as di&s;tinct as his per&s;on, and that the actions of one individual would be no derogation to the character of another; that they were even reduced, though with great regret, to <HI>plead poverty</HI> on the occa&s;ion; for, as the money laid down for the purcha&s;e was not all their own, what with the payment of intere&s;t, and the large incomes they had given up by aban|doning trade, their abilities to oblige Mr. Powell did not keep pace with their inclinations; be&s;ides which, it was to be con&s;idered, that both Mr. Powell and my&s;elf derived emoluments from the theatre, in which they had no &s;hare: but however, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their printed Narrative, p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>to &s;how their unwillingne&s;s to deprive him of any pecuniary advantage, they a&s;&s;ented to his going;</HI> and ordered Mr. Hutchin&s;on to draw up a proper form of permi&s;&s;ion, in writing, on the &s;pot, to be immediately &s;igned by Mr. Colman and them&s;elves. To this, however, Mr. Colman would by no means con&s;ent, &s;aying, that he originally oppo&s;ed Mr. Powell's going to Bri&s;tol <HI>propter dignitatem,</HI> thinking it incon&s;i&s;tent with his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; but that if they had &s;urmounted that ob&s;tacle, he had no &s;tronger objections to urge a|gain&s;t it; though he would never &s;uffer it to appear under his hand, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 15.</NOTE>
<PB N="43" REF="47">
that, for the &s;ake of refu&s;ing &s;ome <HI>ra&s;cal counters to his friend,</HI> he would &s;uffer him to bring an imputation on them all. To &s;hew however, that he did not mean to counteract Mr. Powell's intention, or their per|mi&s;&s;ion, he propo&s;ed to add to that clau&s;e in the article relative to the parties not being concerned in any other theatre, the words <HI>within ten miles of London;</HI> by the in&s;ertion whereof, Mr. Powell would be at li|berty to follow his own inclinations, without rendering Mr. Colman re|&s;pon&s;ible for a conduct which he did not approve, and would be glad to find proper means to prevent. As to the &s;eparate emoluments of Mr. Powell and him&s;elf, he reminded Me&s;&s;. Rutherford and Harris, that they were no more than they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pay to other actors and authors; and that, as Mr. Powell and Mr. Colman paid each a fourth of it them|&s;elves, their particular advantages from their labours were le&s;s than tho&s;e of others in the &s;ame &s;ituation; but that, &s;uch as they were, if Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford would <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See printed Narrative, p. 35.</NOTE> <HI>enact tragedies, or write comedies,</HI> they would be entitled to the like. As to Mr. Colman's <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>going &s;o far as to in&s;i&s;t warmly on the rea&s;onablene&s;s and equity of Mr. Powell's demand of a be|nefit</HI> on this occa&s;ion, it is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, for which I appeal to Mr. Hutchin&s;on. Such a demand, I really think, after the tran&s;action of the 28th of May, would have been both rea&s;onable and equitable; but, to the be&s;t of my knowledge and belief, the mode of compen&s;ation was not mentioned, nor any &s;uch demand then made by Mr. Powell.</P>
<P>By this time the reader will be tolerably enabled to judge how far the narratives, printed and manu&s;cript, <HI>drawn up by the</HI> AUTHORITY of Me&s;&s;s.

PLAYED IT THE PRECEDING SEASON AT DRURY LANE. <HI>On Mrs. Yates's joining the company however, and refu&s;ing to give up the part, it was a&s;&s;igned to neither.</HI> The poor flim&s;y fallacy of their whole repre&s;en|tation of this matter mu&s;t be evident to every per&s;on who has read the foregoing pages of this <HI>true</HI> &s;tate of the ca&s;e. Mi&s;s Ward's claim to the character had never been &s;et up with an air of contradiction to their &s;en|timents; was never maintained in competition with Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham; and was wholly withdrawn within eight days after opening the theatre. Mrs. Yates was engaged on the twelfth of October $actually played Jane Shore on the &s;ixteenth; and whether the character of Imogen &s;hould be performed by Mrs. Yates or Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, was notoriou&s;ly the whole &s;ubject-matter of the violent heats and animo&s;ities from the twenty-ninth of October of the &s;econd of November. Yet, &s;ay Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford, in their printed narrative, after having con|cluded their garbled account of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, <HI>The</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 11.</NOTE> <HI>reconciliation which</HI> ENSUED <HI>gave Harris and Rutherford &s;ome rea&s;on to hope that af|fairs would now be carried on in an amicable manner.</HI> THEY WERE VERY SOON HOWEVER SURPRIZED <HI>with Mr. Colman's having taken upon him to engage Mr. and Mrs. Yates:</HI> an a&s;&s;ertion, in re&s;pect to its chronology, which the very authority of the play-bills is &s;ufficient to confute.</P>
<P>Still, however, (&s;ay they) Mr. Colman engaged Mr. and Mrs. Yates; and the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 13.</NOTE> <HI>&s;urpri&s;e of Harris and Rutherford was the greater, as all the four,</HI> IN A CONSULTATION HELD <HI>&s;ome days before, had been unanimou&s;ly of a con|trary opinion.</HI> The only <HI>con&s;ultation</HI> that I recollect on this affair was, that I had one day the honour of all the proprietors under my roof at din|ner; after which the &s;ubject was &s;tarted, I believe by Mr. Powell, who &s;eemed very de&s;irous of forming &s;uch an engagement. Mr. Rutherford al&s;o &s;eemed to lean to his opinion: I was not wholly di&s;inclined to it, provided we could obtain Mrs. Yates without her hu&s;band, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, excellent as he is, as our company &s;tood, we did not &s;o much need: Mr. Harris was wholly aver&s;e to our thinking of either.</P>
<P>It was then generally &s;aid that Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer were not to return to Dublin; and on the Saturday following the latter was pub|lickly announced, after the play at Drury Lane, to perform there on the &s;ucceeding Wedne&s;day. The impatience and anxiety of Mr. Powell could then no longer be &s;ubdued. He pre&s;t me in the mo&s;t earne&s;t man|ner to permit him to enter into a &s;erious negotiation with Mrs. Yates; adding, that he thought I carried my punctilious delicacy towards the managers of Drury Lane much too far; that if Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer had cro&s;&s;ed the water, and Mrs. Yates had &s;till been &s;tanding $ut upon terms, it would perhaps have been illiberal to interfere; but
<PB N="45" REF="49">
that &s;ince the managers of Drury Lane had thought proper to take Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer into their hou&s;e, &s;till leaving an opening for Mr. and Mrs. Yates, he did not think, in ju&s;tice to our&s;elves, that we ought to omit &s;trengthening our company with &s;o popular an actre&s;s as Mrs. Yates. The&s;e arguments had, in my opinion, &s;o much weight, that I told him I &s;hould be glad to know whether Mrs. Yates would join us <HI>alone.</HI> This, on his application to her, &s;he refu&s;ed; whereupon Mr. Powell intreated me, if I had the lea&s;t regard for his peace of mind, or his reputation, to engage <HI>both.</HI> We went <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11.</NOTE> together to Mr. Harris's hou&s;e in Surry Street. Mr. Harris was out of town. We then went to Mr. Rutherford's in Newman Street. Mr. Rutherford al&s;o not being to be found, a note was left, reque&s;ting the favour of &s;eeing him at the theatre, on earne&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, next morning by ten or eleven o'clock.

<P><HI>To</HI> J. RUTHERFORD, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></P>
<P>In the evening I went to the theatre; and, from the whole tenor of Mr. Rutherford's behaviour, which was agreeable to the &s;pirit of his letter, I concluded, I &s;till think not without rea&s;on, that he was very well &s;atisfied with what we had done, thinking it a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 12.</NOTE> mea&s;ure conducive to the intere&s;t and reputation of the theatre. Mr. Harris, however, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled, appeared extremely di&s;&s;a|tisfied, con&s;truing Mr. Powell's letter as a menace, and declaring his <HI>right to think their con&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary to our forming an engagement of &s;o much expence and con&s;equence</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 12.</NOTE>. I acknowledged that right; and a&s;&s;ured him that Mr. Powell's letter was not intended as a menace; that, con&s;ider|ing the tragick &s;tanding-army of Drury Lane, occa&s;ionally reinforced by Mr. Garrick him&s;elf, if we ever meant to u&s;e a bowl or a dagger this &s;ea&s;on, I thought the mea&s;ure was right; but that if, after all, Mr. Rutherford and him&s;elf &s;hould declare them&s;elves to be of a contrary opinion, Mr. Powell and my&s;elf would chearfully defray the expence of that engagement, being con&s;cious that there was an irregularity, in hav|ing formed it without having previou&s;ly obtained their a&s;&s;ent to it. At length Mr. Powell intreated Mr. Harris, if he had any regard for his (Mr. Powell's) fame or happine&s;s, to &s;hew no farther repugnance to the mea&s;ure; whereupon Mr. Harris declared he would never &s;ay any thing farther again&s;t it. How far Mr. Harris has kept his word, or how far Mr. Rutherford's &s;ub&s;equent conduct has been agreeable to
<PB N="47" REF="51">
his behaviour at that period, the reader is left to determine; and their objection to this engagement, on account of the expence of it, may be e&s;timated by their conference with Mrs. Yates, as well as their letter to her, on the 29th of October. Whether this engagement has enabled us to add to the publick entertainment, the Publick will judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But here again occurs another in&s;tance of collu&s;ion; for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Mr. Powell became entitled to the addition of</HI> 100 <HI>l. to his &s;alary: and it</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Note to ibid.</NOTE> <HI>is to be re|marked that Mr. Woodward's engagement was antecedent to Mr. Powell's article; by virtue of which he was entitled to a larger &s;alary than any per|former hereafter</HI> TO BE <HI>engaged.</HI> The reader is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Powell's article with us, as a Performer, was &s;igned, as appears by the date, on the 28th of May, &s;ome weeks before we were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the patents; and I will appeal to Mr. Hutchin&s;on before-mentioned, who drew the article, and who&s;e name appears as a witne&s;s to it, as well as to the <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of all the parties who &s;igned it, whether the whole &s;cope and intention of that article was not to &s;ecure to Mr. Powell the fir&s;t &s;ala|ry in the theatre. In what manner a court of law might con&s;true the words TO BE <HI>engaged;</HI> and how far the ca&s;ual circum&s;tance of Mr. Woodward's being in articles with the preceding patentees, at a higher &s;alary, might render him an exception; I will not pretend to decide: but before Mr. T. Harris ventures another <HI>compari&s;on</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Note to ibid. p. 26.</NOTE> <HI>between Mr. Powell's di&s;ingenuity and his own genero&s;ity,</HI> we would advi&s;e him not to in&s;i&s;t on the above con&s;truction. Mr. Woodward's excellence in his profe&s;&s;ion is very well known: but does he, excellent as he is, de&s;erve a &s;uperior &s;alary to Mr. Powell? And will any reader of common &s;en&s;e conceive it to be the meaning of any of the parties concerned, to rate Mr. Powell lower than Mr. Woodward?&mdash;This, however, is the ground of the black charge of collu&s;ion between Mr. Powell and Mr. Colman, by which &s;ini&s;ter method they were to add 100 l. to Mr. Powell's &s;alary; fifty of which they were of nece&s;&s;ity to pay them&s;elves, and to divide the remaining fifty between them. Add to which, that e&s;timating Mr. Yates's &s;alary at $00 l. which added to that of Mrs. Yates's, amounted to the gro&s;s &s;um of 800 l. Mr. Colman and Mr. Powell, by a mo&s;t re|fined &s;troke of policy, contrived to pay 200 l. each out of their pock|ets, for the &s;ake of receiving five and twenty. Hence appears the great utility of the narratives of Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford, who <HI>thought it incumbent on them, as well in ju&s;tification of them&s;elves, as out of re&s;pect to the Publick, to prevent, as far as lies in their power,</HI> ANY MISREPRESENTA|TION OF FACTS. <NOTE PLACE="marg">&par; See Apology to their printed Narrative.</NOTE></P>

The relation of the&s;e tran&s;actions, which naturally fell under the charges of <HI>collu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>fraud,</HI> carried on between me and Mr. Powell, has nece&s;&s;arily turned the tide of my narrative, which will now run on, as it began, in the regular cour&s;e of time.</P>

<P>"THE cruel nece&s;&s;ity we lay under of holding corre&s;pondence with you is ex|ceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and dangerous, which we are convinced of from the meeting

<P>You have often threatened us to retire from the management. You have often threatened us to appeal to the Publick; nay, you ab&s;olutely have had the effrontery to dare an appeal <HI>to our friends:</HI> the i&s;&s;ue of <HI>that</HI> appeal, we believe, &s;till lives in your memory.

From the above circum&s;tances &s;evere injuries have, in the opinion of us both, already ari&s;en to our fortunes, and (the barrier being now entirely de&s;troyed, which was formed for our &s;afety) we dread the future ones.</P>

<P>We ob&s;erve it to be your con&s;tant method, when we have objected to a play, that you have ordered a weaker one. <HI>You have no right to order a play for repre&s;entation before it has been propo&s;ed to us.</HI> What can be expected from the play of to-night, weak in it&s;elf, and having been already repeated this &s;ea&s;on to bad hou&s;es?

<P>Agreeable and entertaining as it was, we had neither lei&s;ure nor in|clination to maintain &s;o polite a corre&s;pondence.

<P>"UPON peru&s;al of the ca&s;e of Mr. H. and Mr. R. and the articles of agree|ment therein &s;tated, and the letters which have pa&s;&s;ed between them and Mr. C. I am of opinion that Mr. C. and Mr. P. have been guilty of many material and &s;ub|&s;tantial

As al&s;o in em|ploying and taking into the &s;ervice of the Theatre Mr. and Mrs. Yates, (e&s;pe|cially at &s;o large &s;alaries) not only without the con&s;ent of Mr. H. and Mr. R. but even contrary to a re&s;olution wherein he (Mr. C.) him&s;elf joined with Mr. H. and R. a few days before.&mdash;And with re&s;pect to Mr. P. in taking great part of the wa$drobe from the Theatre into the particular po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf or his wife.

Harris and Rutherford, with the &s;ame &s;pirit of openne&s;s and ingenuity that has &s;hone through all their conduct, tran&s;mitted to me a copy of a learned coun&s;el's opinion, without &s;ending me, at the &s;ame time, a copy of the ca&s;e whereon that opinion was given; and how far I wronged tho&s;e gentlemen in <HI>affect|ing to think,</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 31.</NOTE> <HI>that a fair and impartial &s;tate of the ca&s;e had not been laid before the coun&s;el;</HI> tho&s;e who have compared this plain tale with their tales, may ea&s;ily determine. The client who deceives his coun&s;el, ul|timately deceives him&s;elf; but the truth is, that the chief object in view was, to draw from &s;ome eminent coun&s;el &s;uch an opinion, as might &s;erve to bow my mind to truckle to the &s;lavery which they would im|po&s;e upon me; for the reader mu&s;t, by this time, be convinced, that in the &s;hort &s;pace of my theatrical direction, every method of in&s;ult and intimidation has been u&s;ed to drive me to &s;acrifice our property, and the credit and intere&s;t of the theatre, to their partialities, and the caprice and vanity of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham; of which my &s;ubmitting to take the part of Mrs. Sullen, in the Stratagem, from Mrs. Bulkley, in favour of
<PB N="58" REF="62">
Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, is an in&s;tance of which I &s;orely repent, and for which I am &s;till, to u&s;e one of their favourite figures, <HI>burning with &s;hame.</HI> The ca&s;e la$d before their coun&s;el, as plainly appears from the references to it in the opinion, contained the &s;ame charges, &s;upported by the &s;ame evidence, that are urged again&s;t us in their printed and manu&s;cript li|bels. Their Narratives, indeed, and the ca&s;e &s;ubmitted to coun&s;el, are materially, and &s;ub&s;tantially, one and the &s;ame; fir&s;t tran&s;mitted to coun&s;el by a hackney-writer of one &s;ort, and then dre&s;&s;ed up for publick in&s;pection by a hackney-writer of another.</P>
<P>Still, however, it is urged <HI>that the court of Chancery would decree a &s;pecifick performance of the articles.</HI> I do not doubt but it would. But give me leave to a&s;k tho&s;e gentlemen, and even their coun&s;el, what is <HI>a &s;pecifick performance</HI> of the articles? Is it that I am not to carry on the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of the Theatre without previou&s;ly &s;ubmitting <HI>at all times,</HI> every minute particular to their con&s;ideration and controul? Is not the acting manager to appoint, or, from the contingencies of &s;ickne&s;s or other accidents, to alter a play appointed for repre&s;entation, without their previous concern? Is he not to ca&s;t the parts of a &s;ingle play, be|&s;peak a &s;ingle dre&s;s, or occa&s;ionally &s;ub&s;titute Mrs. Bulkley for Mi&s;s Macklin, without &s;ending at eight or nine o'clock in the evening to Mr. Rutherford in Newman-&s;treet, and to Mr. Harris in Surry-&s;treet? If this be <HI>a &s;pecifick performance,</HI> as the above letters con&s;true it to be, it leaves the director le&s;s power than is commonly and nece&s;&s;arily lodged in the Prompter: and I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that the wi&s;dom and equity of the noble&s;t court of judicature in the world will &s;olemnly decree &s;uch <HI>a &s;pe|cifick performance,</HI> as the nature of the ca&s;e renders impo&s;&s;ible to be put in execution.</P>
<P>Granting, however, for argument &s;ake, that the court would even decree <HI>a &s;pecifick performance</HI> of that &s;ort, for which <HI>the narrators</HI> contend, give me leave to a&s;k another que&s;tion: Mu&s;t not <HI>their negative power</HI> be always exerci&s;ed in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in&s;tance? and can they, after having openly or tacitly concurred in a mea&s;ure, capriciou&s;ly retract that concurrence? After having not only approved, but <HI>de&s;ired,</HI> the repre&s;entation of Cym|beline; after having con&s;ented to the expen&s;ive decoration of it; had they a right, not only on the eve of its repre&s;entation, but even after the repre&s;entation of it at the Command of Their Maje&s;ties, to prohibit the repetition of it? If this be, as they a&s;&s;ert, their <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 30.</NOTE> <HI>indubitable right to a ne|gative voice,</HI> by the &s;ame indubitable right they might re&s;train me from opening our doors; and after the lengths to which they have proceeded, I &s;hould not be at all &s;urprized at their attempting to exerci&s;e their <HI>nega|tive power</HI> in that manner.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="63">
But then <HI>the Court would order Me&s;&s;. Colman and Powell to make &s;atisfaction to Harris and Rutherford for their re&s;pective &s;hares of all</HI> DAMAGES <HI>which &s;hould appear to have been &s;u&s;tained by any breach of tho&s;e articles by them re&s;pectively.</HI> Undoubtedly; and it would be plea&s;ant to be called on for <HI>damages</HI> in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance in any court of judicature. It is a cau&s;e worthy to come on before Trappolin. Make out a panel from the pit, and a&s;k any twelve on the jury, what <HI>damages</HI> they think have ari&s;en to Covent-Garden Theatre this &s;ea&s;on from the addition of Mr. and Mrs. Yates to the company? a&s;k the Trea&s;urer of the Theatre, what <HI>da|mages</HI> have ari&s;en from the repre&s;entation of Cymbeline? a&s;k the ward|robe keepers, and other officers of the Theatre, what <HI>damages appear to have been &s;u&s;tained by any b$each of articles by Me&s;&s;. Colman and Powell re|&s;pectively?</HI> If in all the&s;e in&s;tances, nothing but nece&s;&s;ary expences, fairly brought to account, appear on one hand; if great <HI>benefit</HI> to the pro|perty appears to have ari&s;en on the other; alas! poor Powell, what will become of thee? alas! poor Colman, what will become of thee! <HI>Solventur ri&s;u tabulae: Tu mi&s;&s;us abibis.</HI></P>
<P>The words <HI>effrontery</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;uran$e</HI> are favourite terms in the polite vocabulary of Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford. They a&s;&s;ert they <HI>verily be|lieve</HI> they have incurred a lo&s;s of no le&s;s than 3500 <HI>l.</HI> by Colman's <HI>mi&s;|management.</HI> What does the world think of their <HI>mode&s;ty?</HI></P>
<P>To talk of <HI>damages</HI> is a very &s;erious matter. Suppo&s;e, by a capricious di&s;play of their <HI>negative power,</HI> damages &s;hould ari&s;e; would not the other proprietors, would not every performer of the Theatre, if injured by &s;uch conduct, have a right to call judicially upon Me&s;&s;. Harris and Rutherford to make good &s;uch damages?</P>
<P>As to the real intention of the re&s;trictive clau&s;e in the article, and the declared object of it, at the time of its execution, it was merely to re&s;erve a provi&s;ional power of re&s;traint, which they then declared would probably not be exerci&s;ed once in &s;even years, and very po&s;&s;ibly would never be exerci&s;ed at all. Nay, they avow them&s;elves that they <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 3.</NOTE> <HI>enter|tained no doubt of Mr. Colman's capacity or inclination to conduct the theatre to the be&s;t advantage;</HI> &s;o that the negative clau&s;e was added, only le&s;t any <HI>&s;ini&s;ter accident might render their interpo&s;ition nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of their property</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.<HI>&mdash;Nec Deus inter&s;it, ni&s;i dignus vindice nodus&mdash;</HI>&s;eems to have been the meaning of all parties. Has the <HI>dignus vindice nodus</HI> yet oc|curred? And has any SINISTER ACCIDENT <HI>rendered their interpo&s;ition ne|ce&s;&s;ary,</HI> except the repre&s;entation of the character of Imogen by Mrs. Yates, in&s;tead of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham?</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64">
The truth is, and they have confe&s;&s;ed it, that the two <HI>gentlemen managers</HI> meant to avail them&s;elves of the talents of William Powell <HI>the player,</HI> and George Colman <HI>the dramatick author.</HI> To this end they chearfully &s;ub&s;cribed, although not indefinitely, to my abilities for the province of director; and Mr. Powell did not &s;cruple to give up his &s;hare of the <HI>po&s;itive power,</HI> thinking it &s;afely lodged in my hands. Still, however, they had &s;ecured to them&s;elves a <HI>negative power,</HI> which, in&s;tead of re&s;erv|ing till the end of <HI>&s;even years,</HI> the reader has &s;een they not only exerted, but <HI>exceeded,</HI> before the end of <HI>&s;even days.</HI> The force of the re&s;trictive clau&s;e is not que&s;tioned; and it is certain, that if they chu&s;e to counteract their own intere&s;ts for the &s;ake of abridging my authority, they have frequent opportunities to embarra&s;s me in the theatrical management. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 29.</NOTE> <HI>How comes it then,</HI> &s;ay they in triumph, <HI>that Mr. Colman,</HI> A GENTLE|MAN BRED IN THE STUDY OF THE LAW, <HI>&s;hould enter into &s;uch ab&s;urd ar|ticles?</HI> The hi&s;tory of the memorable vi&s;it with which I was honoured by Mr. Harris, on my return from Bath, is a full an&s;wer to their que&s;|tion. There are quirks in morality, as well as quirks in the law; but I did not conceive that I was dealing with a petty-fogger in either.</P>
<P>As to my management of the theatre, of my merit or demerit in that particular, the Publick are the mo&s;t competent judges; but it ill be|comes my fellow-patentees to &s;ugge&s;t matter of reproof on that &s;ubject to the per&s;on who is &s;aid to be their <HI>hi&s;toriographer;</HI> and it ill becomes him to revile me for my <HI>gratuitous</HI> &s;ervices, while he is &s;aid to be him&s;elf a candidate to repre&s;ent us all four as a <HI>&s;tipendiary</HI> manager. Mr. Spat|ter, if it be Mr. Spatter, is "one of tho&s;e wretches who <HI>mi&s;call</HI> them|&s;elves authors; a fellow, who&s;e heart, and tongue, and pen, are equally &s;candalous; who tries to in&s;inuate him&s;elf every where, to make mi&s;|chief if there is none, and to increa&s;e it if he finds any." Mr. Ken|rick, the ingenious author of the Widowed Wife, and of the candid and gentleman-like Review of Dr. John&s;on's Shake&s;peare, has been plea&s;ed to pay me a very particular compliment in the prologue to his mo&s;t excellent dramatick performance; and I will refer it to that gen|tleman, unle&s;s perhaps he may be thought <HI>partial,</HI> whether Mr. Spat|ter, or my&s;elf, is the fitte&s;t per&s;on to be employed in the direction of a theatre. Mr. Spatter perhaps may flatter him&s;elf with the hopes of ex|pelling me from the management, and of &s;eating him&s;elf, by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his friends, in the vacant chair; but Mr. Spatter is mi&s;taken. Let him, if he plea&s;es, make rules for experimental philo&s;ophers in his trade of bra&s;s-rule-maker: let him make rules for authors in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Monthly Reviewer; but never, while Mr. Powell and my&s;elf are concerned in the property, &s;hall he <HI>openly</HI> make rules for the ma|nagement of Covent Garden theatre.</P>

We are told, however, that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Me&s;&s;.

That I have as rea&s;onable a claim to a &s;alary for managing, as Mr. Powell for acting, is mo&s;t certain; and indeed in &s;ome re&s;pects the claim is more rea&s;onable, as the acting-manager incurs, in many in&s;tances, an unavoid|able expence: but that <HI>it was never intended I &s;hould take more trouble than Harris and Rutherford,</HI> is fal&s;e on the very face of the article. After their interpretation of Mr. Powell's article, I am not in the lea&s;t &s;urprized at their candid con&s;truction of the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of mine; and the in|&s;inuation of <HI>&s;ini&s;ter views in my unreque&s;ted officiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is as true as it is generous.
