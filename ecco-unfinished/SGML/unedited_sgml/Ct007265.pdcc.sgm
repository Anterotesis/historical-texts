<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have a&s;&s;um'd the liberty of dedicating the following Poem to the HEIR-APPARENT of the BRITISH Crown, without his knowledge or permi&s;&s;ion. In extenuation of &s;uch freedom, I hope I may be allow'd to plead a long and invariable At|tachment to the ILLUSTRIOUS Hou&s;e of HANOVER.</P>
<P>As I have never been us'd to pace in the trammels of Flattery, I &s;hall not even attempt a Di&s;play of that LIBERAL turn of mind, which cha|racterizes the PRINCE of WALES, le&s;t
<PB N="vi" REF="4">Truth &s;hould have the appearance of Flattery.</P>
<P>After this declaration I mu&s;t be totally &s;ilent on the many accom|pli&s;hments, which adorn the PRINCE and the MAN.</P>
<P>When Heaven &s;hall &s;ummon your ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER to enjoy the reward of his public and private Vir|tues, and the SUBJECT is rai&s;ed to the SOVEREIGN, I &s;incerely wi&s;h that your royal Highne&s;s may, during your WHOLE reign, ju&s;tly acquire the NOBLEST of all earthly titles, that of a PATRIOT-KING.</P>
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
<P>If a Peru&s;al of the following Poem &s;hould luckily afford your ROYAL HIGHNESS the lea&s;t plea&s;ure or enter|tainment, I &s;hall think my&s;elf amply rewarded for the time I have &s;pent in its compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I beg leave to have the honour of &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf,</P>
