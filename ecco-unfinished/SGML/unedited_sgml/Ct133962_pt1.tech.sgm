<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TEN years have elap&s;ed &s;ince I gave to the Public
a volume of Letters under the title of, &startq;<HI>Sketches
on the Natural, Civil, and Political State of Switzer|land.</HI>&endq;
The favourable reception of that work in|duced
me, in 1779, to make a journey through the
country of the Gri&s;ons, a part of Switzerland hitherto
little known. Having, in 1785 and 1787, opportu|nities
of revi&s;iting the &s;ame &s;pots which I had before
de&s;cribed, I was anxious to revi&s;e and augment my
former publication. With this view I compared my
de&s;criptions at the very places, which I attempted to
delineate; attentively peru&s;ed the critici&s;ms of &s;uc|ceeding
travellers; and in many of the principal towns,
I entreated &s;everal per&s;ons, of political or literary emi|nence,
to correct any errors, or to &s;ugge&s;t any improve|ment,
with re&s;pect to tho&s;e particular parts, with
which, from &s;ituation, they were mo&s;t conver&s;ant.</P>
<P>THE materials collected from the&s;e and other
&s;ources, increa&s;ed by my own ob&s;ervations and re|&s;earches,
encourage me to hope, that the pre&s;ent im|proved
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
account of &s;o intere&s;ting a country as Switzerland,
will not be unacceptable to the Public, and will be
con&s;idered as a new work.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to appri&s;e the purcha&s;ers of the
former editions, that it was my intention to have &s;epa|rately
printed the corrections and additions, for their
convenience; but it is pre&s;umed, that a compari&s;on of
the pre&s;ent publication with the former editions, will
&s;ufficiently prove, that the de&s;ign was impracticable.</P>

<P>IN regard to the former publication on Switzerland, the
Author acknowledges his obligations to Colonel Floyd,
for the u&s;e of the accurate journal which he kept during
their joint tour, and to the judicious animadver&s;ions of the
elegant writer to whom the&s;e Letters are addre&s;&s;ed. For
this improved work he holds him&s;elf no le&s;s indebted for
various communications from Thomas Pennant, E&s;q. and
David Pennant, E&s;q.; and to the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dr.
Pulteney, the Rev. Thomas Martyn, Profe&s;&s;or of Botany in
the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and the Rev. Richard Relhan.</P>
<P>As it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of letters, to in|terrupt
the reader by perpetual references to authorities, I
have &s;ubjoined, in an appendix to the &s;econd volume, a
catalogue of the principal works which I have occa&s;ionally
con&s;ulted in the cour&s;e of this publication.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Done&s;chingen, <DATE>July 21, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now at Done&s;chingen, in my way towards Switzer|land;
a country long celebrated for the peculiarities of its
different governments, and for the &s;ingular beauties con|ferred
upon it by nature. If it will not be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon
your patience, I propo&s;e to trouble you with &s;ome account of
my tour. For I am per&s;uaded, that I &s;hall travel with much
greater pro&s;it to my&s;elf; as the reflection that my ob&s;erva|tions
are to be communicated to you, will render me more
attentive and accurate in forming them.</P>
<P>WE quitted Stra&s;burgh ye&s;terday, and cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine to
Kehl, formerly an important fortre&s;s belonging to Stra&s;burgh
when an imperial city. It was al&s;o &s;trongly forti&s;ied by the
French, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in 1648: being coded to
<PB N="2" REF="18">
the Empire at the peace of Ry&s;wic, the Emperor con&s;igned
it to the hou&s;e of Baden, re&s;erving, however, to him&s;elf the
right of a garri&s;on. Since that period, it has been twice at|tacked
by the French: and as during the la&s;t &s;iege, in 1733,
the works were con&s;iderably damaged, the imperial garri&s;on
has been withdrawn. At pre&s;ent, there are only the ruins
of the ancient fortifications; and by way of garri&s;on, a few
invalids belonging to the Margrave of Baden. From thence
we proceeded to Offenburgh, a &s;mall imperial town; and
&s;oon after, entered the beautiful valley of Kin&s;ing: we pa&s;&s;ed
through Gengenbach, another &s;mall imperial town, finely
&s;ituated; and continued our journey by the &s;ide of the &s;mall
river Kin&s;ing; ri&s;ing gradually for &s;everal leagues together,
until we found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of the Black Fore&s;t.
As we a&s;cended, the country became more wild and romantic,
and the river more rapid; on each hand mountains, who&s;e
acclivities were finely cultivated, and who&s;e tops were richly
covered with a continual fore&s;t. Several &s;mall &s;treams of the
cleare&s;t water rolled down the &s;ides of the mountains, in
numberle&s;s ca&s;cades; and uniting, fell into the Kin&s;ing.
The views were &s;o exceedingly diver&s;ified; the villages &s;o
delightfully &s;ituated; and the cottages &s;o extremely pictu|re&s;que,
that we almo&s;t &s;eemed to have anticipated the ro|mantic
beauties of Switzerland.</P>
<P>DONESCHINGEN is the principal re&s;idence of the prince
of Fur&s;tenberg: in the court-yard of his palace, the Danube
takes its ri&s;e. I am this moment returned from vi&s;iting the
&s;pot; the de&s;cription of which may be compri&s;ed in a few
words. Some &s;mall &s;prings bubbling from the ground, form
<PB N="3" REF="19">
a ba&s;on of clear water, of about thirty feet &s;quare: from this
ba&s;on i&s;&s;ues the Danube, which is here only a little brook.
And though the two &s;mall rivers of Bribach and Brege,
uniting below the town, are far more con&s;iderable than this
&s;tream, which flows into them &s;oon after their junction; yet
the latter alone has the honour of being called the Source of
the Danube. After we had gone through the ceremony of
&s;triding acro&s;s the &s;tream, in order to &s;ay, that we had <HI>&s;lepped</HI>
over the Danube, we &s;oon &s;atisfied our curio&s;ity; the object
it&s;elf being in no re&s;pect extraordinary, but deriving its prin|cipal
con&s;ideration from being the &s;ource of &s;o noble a river.
Indeed, it was this circum&s;tance alone that induced us to
enter Switzerland by the way of Suabia.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ARRIVAL IN SWITZERLAND&mdash;SCHAFFHAUSEN&mdash;FALL OF THE RHINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Schaffhau&s;en, <DATE>July 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I FEEL great delight in breathing the air of liberty; every
per&s;on here has apparently the mien of content and &s;atis|faction.
The cleanline&s;s of the hou&s;es, and of the people, is
peculiarly &s;triking; and I can trace in all their manners,
behaviour, and dre&s;s, &s;ome &s;trong outlines, which di&s;tingui&s;h
this happy people from the neighbouring nations. Perhaps
it may be prejudice and unrea&s;onable partiality; but I am the
more plea&s;ed, becau&s;e their fir&s;t appearance reminds me of
my own countrymen, and I could almo&s;t think, for a mo|ment,
that I am in England<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On again entering Schaffhau&s;en, the 18th of July, 1786, I was not &s;o much &s;truck with its neatne&s;s as in 1776. The rea&s;on is obvious. In my former expe|dition I emerged from the wilds of Suabia, on the latter occa&s;ion I had ju&s;t quitted the cultivated parts of Bavaria.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SCHAFFHAUSEN, a tolerably well-built town, &s;ituated upon
the northern &s;hore of the Rhine, is the capital of the canton,
and owes its origin to the interruption of the navigation of
that river by the cataract at Lauffen: huts being at fir&s;t con|&s;tructed
for the convenience of unloading the merchandize
from the boats, it by degrees increa&s;ed to a large town.
Schaffhau&s;en was formerly an imperial city, and governed by
<PB N="5" REF="21">
an ari&s;tocracy: it was mortgaged in 1330, by the Emperor
Louis of Bavaria, to the Dukes of Au&s;tria, and was relea&s;ed
from its dependency by the Emperor Sigi&s;mond, when Fre|derick
Duke of Au&s;tria was put under the ban of the empire.
In 1501, it was admitted a member of the Helvetic confede|racy;
and is the twelfth canton in rank. Of all the cantons,
it is the lea&s;t in &s;ize, being only five leagues in length and
three in breadth: its population is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to
thirty thou&s;and &s;ouls; of which, the capital contains about
&s;ix thou&s;and.</P>
<P>THE whole number of citizens or burge&s;&s;es (in whom the
&s;upreme power ultimately re&s;ides) is about &s;ixteen hundred.
They are divided into twelve tribes: and from the&s;e are
elected eighty-five members, who form the great and little
council. To the&s;e two councils combined, the admini&s;tra|tion
of affairs is committed: the &s;enate, or little council of
twenty-five, being entru&s;ted with the executive power; and
the great council, compri&s;ing the &s;enate, finally deciding all
appeals, and regulating the more important concerns of
government.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the &s;tate are not very con&s;iderable, as will
appear from the &s;alary of the burgoma&s;ter, or chief of the
republic; which barely amounts of &pound;. 150 <HI>per ann.</HI> The re|formation
was introduced in 1529: the clergy are paid by the
&s;tate, but their income is &s;carcely &s;ufficient for their main|tenance;
the be&s;t living being only about &pound;. 100, and the
wor&s;t &pound;. 40 <HI>per ann.</HI> The profe&s;&s;ors of literature al&s;o, who
are taken from the clergy, are paid by government; and a
<PB N="6" REF="22">
&s;chool is &s;upported at the public expence. Sumptuary laws
are in force here, as well as in mo&s;t parts of Switzerland; and
no dancing is allowed, except upon particular occa&s;ions.
The principal article of exportation is wine; of which a large
quantity is made, the country abounding in vineyards: and
as the canton furni&s;hes but little corn, it is procured from
Suabia in exchange for wine. In the town there are a few
manufactures of linen, cotton, and &s;ilk.</P>
<P>IT will perhaps give you &s;ome idea of the &s;ecurity of the
Swi&s;s republics, when I inform you, that Schaffhau&s;en,
although a frontier town, has no garri&s;on; and that the for|tifications
are but weak. The citizens mount guard by turns;
and the people of the canton being divided into regular com|panies
of militia, which are exerci&s;ed yearly, are always pre|pared
to act in defence of their country. This canton has
&s;ome troops in France, Sardinia, and Holland; the only
foreign &s;ervices into which the &s;ubjects of the Prote&s;tant
cantons enli&s;t.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take leave of this town, I mu&s;t not omit men|tioning
the bridge over the Rhine; ju&s;tly admired for the
&s;ingularity of its architecture. The river is extremely rapid,
and had already de&s;troyed &s;everal &s;tone bridges of the
&s;tronge&s;t con&s;truction; when a carpenter of Appenzel
offered to throw a wooden bridge, of a &s;ingle arch, acro&s;s the
river, which is near four hundred feet wide. The magi|&s;trates,
however, required that it &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of two arches,
and that he &s;hould for that purpo&s;e pre&s;erve the middle pier
of the old bridge. Accordingly, the architect was obliged
<PB N="7" REF="23">
to obey; but he has contrived to leave it a matter of doubt,
whether the bridge is &s;upported by the middle pier, and
whether it would not have been equally &s;afe if formed &s;olely
of one arch.</P>
<P>IT is a wooden bridge, of which the &s;ides and top are
covered, and is what the Germans call a <HI>haengewerk,</HI> or hang|ing
bridge; the road, which is almo&s;t level, is not carried,
as u&s;ual, over the top of the arch; but, if I may u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
is let into the middle of it, and there &s;u&s;pended.
The pier is not in a right line with the buttre&s;&s;es; as it
forms with them an obtu&s;e angle pointing down the &s;tream,
being eight feet out of the rectilinear direction. The di&s;tance
of this middle pier from the &s;ide that lies towards the town,
is a hundred and &s;eventy-two feet, and from the oppo&s;ite
bank, a hundred and ninety-three; in all, three hundred and
&s;ixty-four feet; making in appearance two arches of a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
width, and forming a beautiful per&s;pective when
viewed at &s;ome di&s;tance. A man of the &s;lighte&s;t weight feels
it almo&s;t tremble under him; yet waggons heavily laden
pa&s;s over without danger. It has been compared to a tight
rope, which trembles when &s;truck, but &s;till pre&s;erves its firm
and equal ten&s;ion. I went under this bridge, in order to
examine the mechani&s;m; and could not avoid being highly
plea&s;ed with the &s;implicity of the architecture: I was not
capable of determining whether it re&s;ts upon the middle pier,
though many judges agree that it does not.</P>
<P>ON con&s;idering the greatne&s;s of the plan, and the boldne&s;s
of the con&s;truction, it is matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that the
<PB N="8" REF="24">
architect was originally a carpenter, without the lea&s;t tincture
of literature, totally ignorant of mathematics, and not ver&s;ed
in the theory of mechanics. The name of this extraor|dinary
man was Ulric Grubenman, a native of Tuffen, a &s;mall
village in the canton of Appenzel. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon
natural abilities, and a &s;urpri&s;ing turn for the practical
part of mechanics, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great eminence;
and may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t inge|nious
architects of the pre&s;ent century. This bridge was
fini&s;hed in le&s;s than three years, and co&s;t ninety thou&s;and
florins<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">About &pound;. 8000 &s;terling.&mdash;Mr. Andrae, in his Letters upon Switzerland, has given two engravings of this bridge, to which he has added a very accurate de&s;cription of its mechanical con&s;truction, communicated by Mr. Jetzler of Schaffhau&s;en. In this de|&s;cription he repre&s;ents it as con&s;i&s;ting of two arches, and re&s;ting upon the middle pier. Several per&s;ons well &s;killed in architecture, maintained a contrary opinion; and in the former editions I was induced to adopt it, for the following rea&s;ons. The architect him&s;elf con&s;tantly maintained, that the bridge was not &s;upported by the pier; his nephew, who was employed in its con&s;truc|tion, confirmed the &s;ame a&s;&s;ertion; and as, at fir&s;t, it did not even touch the pier, it mu&s;t therefore, at that time, have been con|&s;idered as forming but one arch. I mu&s;t, however, candidly own, that in my &s;ub&s;e|quent vi&s;its to Schaffhau&s;en in 1785 and 1786, I had rea&s;on to change my opinion. At tho&s;e periods the bridge was &s;upported on piles, in order to undergo a thorough repair. Mr. Spengler, a native of the town, and lately returned from Ru&s;&s;ia, where he had pa&s;&s;ed many years in the capacity of an architect, fortunately di&s;covered, that much ill-&s;ea&s;oned wood having been employed in its con&s;truction, many of the timbers were ab&s;olutely decayed; and that one &s;ide had greatly &s;werved from its original direction. This ingenious arti&s;t, after having expa|tiated on the &s;implicity and boldne&s;s of the de&s;ign, informed me, that the bridge un|doubtedly con&s;i&s;ts of two arches: and that although Grubenman, of who&s;e abilities he &s;poke with de&s;erved encomium, affected to place the timbers in &s;uch a manner as to re&s;emble but one arch, and always a&s;&s;erted that it was not &s;upported by the pier; yet that the whole fabric would undoubtedly have fallen if that pier had been taken away. He obligingly &s;hewed me his plan for re|pairing the bridge, and for &s;trengthening it by means of additional timbers, in order to render it able to &s;upport its own weight, when the piles &s;hould be removed.&mdash;Vid. <HI>Briefe aus der Schweiz nach Hannover ge&s;|chrichen.</HI> Zuric, 1776.</NOTE>.</P>

THIS morning we rode about a league, to the Fall of the
Rhine at Lauffen, a &s;mall village in the canton of Zuric. Our
route lay over the hills which form the banks of the river:
the environs are picture&s;que and agreeable; the river beau|tifully
winding through the vale. Upon our arrival at
Lauffen, we di&s;mounted; and advancing to the edge of the
precipice which overhangs the Rhine, we looked down per|pendicularly
upon the cataract, and &s;aw the river tumbling
over the &s;ides of the rock with amazing violence and preci|pitation.
From hence we de&s;cended till we were &s;omewhat
below the upper bed of the river, and &s;tood clo&s;e to the fall;
&s;o that I could almo&s;t have touched it with my hand. A
&s;caffold is erected in the very &s;pray of this tremendous cata|ract,
and upon the mo&s;t &s;ublime point of view:&mdash;the &s;ea of
foam ru&s;hing down&mdash;the continual cloud of &s;pray &s;cattered
to a great di&s;tance, and to a con&s;iderable height&mdash;in &s;hort,
the magnificence of the whole &s;cenery far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my mo&s;t
&s;anguine expectations, and exceeds all de&s;cription. Within
an hundred feet of the &s;caffold, two crags ri&s;e in the middle
of the fall: the neare&s;t is perforated by the continual action
of the river; and the water forces it&s;elf through in an ob|lique
direction, with inexpre&s;&s;ible fury, and an hollow &s;ound.
After having contemplated the awful &s;ublimity of this won|derful
land&s;cape, we de&s;cended; and cro&s;&s;ed the river, which
was extremely agitated.</P>
<P>HITHERTO I had only viewed the cataract obliquely; but
here it opened by degrees, and di&s;played another picture,
which I enjoyed at my lei&s;ure, as I &s;at down upon the oppo|&s;ite
bank. The mo&s;t &s;triking objects were, the ca&s;tle of
<PB N="10" REF="27">
Lauffen, erected upon the very edge of the precipice, and
projecting over the river; near it, a church and &s;ome cot|tages;
a clump of cottages clo&s;e to the fall; in the back
ground, rocks, planted with vines, or tufted with hanging
woods; a beautiful little hamlet upon the &s;ummit, &s;kirted
with trees; the great body of water, that &s;eemed to ru&s;h out
from the bottom of the rocks; the two crags boldly advanc|ing
their heads in the mid&s;t of the fall, and in the very
point of its &s;teepe&s;t de&s;cent, their tops &s;prinkled with &s;hrubs,
and dividing the cataract into three principal branches. The
colour of the Rhine is extremely beautiful, being of a clear
&s;ea-green; and I could not but remark the fine effect of the
tints, when blended with the white foam in its de&s;cent.
There is a plea&s;ing view from an iron foundery clo&s;e to the
river, which is dammed up, in order to prevent its carrying
away the works and neighbouring cottages: by means of
this dam a &s;mall portion of the river is diverted, turns a mill,
and forms a little &s;ilver current, gliding down the bare rock,
and detached from the main cataract. Below the fall the
river widens con&s;iderably into a more ample ba&s;on; at the
fall, the breadth &s;eemed to be about three hundred feet.
In regard to its perpendicular height, travellers differ: tho&s;e
who are given to exaggeration compute it a hundred feet;
but I &s;hould imagine about fifty or &s;ixty feet will be nearer the
truth. I &s;tood for &s;ome upon the brink of the cataract; be|held
with admiration; and li&s;tened in &s;ilence; then cro&s;&s;ed the
river; remounted my hor&s;e; and returned to Schaffhau&s;en.</P>
<P>SOME writers have a&s;&s;erted that the Rhine precipitates it|&s;elf
in one &s;heet of water; and, as I before ob&s;erved, from
<PB N="11" REF="28">
a perpendicular height of a hundred feet. In former ages
this account might be agreeable to fact; as it is probable
that the &s;pace between the banks was once a level rock, and
con&s;iderably higher; and that the river has in&s;en&s;ibly un|dermined
tho&s;e parts, on which it broke with the utmo&s;t
violence: for, within the memory of &s;everal inhabitants of
this town, a large rock has given way, that has greatly alter|ed
the appearance. Indeed I am convinced that the perpen|dicular
height of the fall is dimini&s;hed every year, by the
continual friction of &s;o large and rapid a body of water; and
have no doubt but that the two crags, which now ri&s;e in the
mid&s;t of the river, will in time be undermined and carried
away. The Rhine, for &s;ome way before the fall, even near
the bridge, da&s;hes upon a rocky bottom, and renders navi|gation
impracticable for any kind of ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Con&s;tance, <DATE>July 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY morning we quitted Schaffhau&s;en, and
cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Die&s;&s;enhoffen, a &s;mall town in
Thurgau; a country dependent upon the eight antient can|tons:
from thence to Stein the road lay by the &s;ide of that
river. Stein is an independent town under the protection of
Zuric, but governed by its own laws and magi&s;trates. At
this place we took a boat to carry us to Con&s;tance. A little
above the town of Stein the river widens con&s;iderably, and
forms the inferior lake of Con&s;tance, or the <HI>Zeller See;</HI>
which is divided into two branches; from Stein to Con&s;tance
is about &s;ixteen miles, and from the latter to Zell, its greate&s;t
breadth, about ten.</P>
<P>A FINE breeze &s;oon carried us to the i&s;land of Reichenau,
which belongs to the Bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance: it is about three
miles long, and one broad; contains about &s;ixteen hundred
inhabitants, all Catholics; three pari&s;hes; one village; and
a rich abbey of Benedictines, of which the bi&s;hop is abbot.
The &s;uperior was exceedingly civil, and &s;hewed us all the
relics and curio&s;ities of the convent: among the latter was a
carious tooth of Charles Le Gros. That monarch, who was
<PB N="13" REF="30">
emperor and king of France, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed dominions
as exten&s;ive as tho&s;e of Charlemagne, lived to want the com|mon
nece&s;&s;aries of life, and to depend for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
upon the charity of an archbi&s;hop of Mentz. He was pub|licly
depo&s;ed in 887, at a meeting of the principal French,
German, and Italian barons, whom he him&s;elf had &s;um|moned:
after having langui&s;hed a year, in extreme want
and mi&s;ery, he died at a &s;mall village near Mentz, in Ger|many,
and his remains were conveyed to this convent. The
next remarkable curio&s;ity, was an emerald, as it is called, of
an extraordinary &s;ize, which, according to the annals of the
convent, was a pre&s;ent from Charlemagne. Take its dimen|&s;ions,
and then judge whether it can be an emerald: it has
four unequal &s;ides; the longe&s;t of which is near two feet,
and the broade&s;t about nine inches; it is one inch thick, and
weighs about twenty-nine pounds. The &s;uperior valued it
at &pound;. 4500; but if it is, as I conjecture, nothing more than a
tran&s;parent green <HI>&s;path-fluor,</HI> its value will be reduced to a
few &s;hillings. Upon our return to the inn, where we dined,
we found a pre&s;ent from the &s;uperior, more valuable than
all the relics and curio&s;ities of his convent&mdash;two bottles of
excellent wine, the growth of the i&s;land, which is almo&s;t a
continued vineyard.</P>
<P>IN the evening we arrived at Con&s;tance; the &s;ituation of
which upon the Rhine, between the two lakes, is mo&s;t de|lightful.
I was much affected with the &s;olitary appearance
of a town once &s;o flouri&s;hing in commerce, and &s;o celebrated
in the annals of hi&s;tory. A dead &s;tillne&s;s reigns through|out;
gra&s;s grown in the principal &s;treets; in a word, it wears
<PB N="14" REF="31">
the melancholy a&s;pect of being almo&s;t totally de&s;erted; and
&s;carcely contains three thou&s;and inhabitants. This city has
endured a &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune: it was formerly in alliance
with Zuric and Ba&s;le; and, &s;upported by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
had expelled the bi&s;hop, and embraced the reformation.
But the Prote&s;tant cantons being wor&s;ted in 1351; and the
league of Smalcade, of which Con&s;tance was a member, be|ing
defeated by Charles V. the town was obliged to &s;ubmit
to the emperor, and to re-admit the Catholic religion. From
this period it lo&s;t its independence; and being neglected by
the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, fell by degrees into its pre&s;ent almo&s;t
annihilated &s;tate; exhibiting to &s;ome of the neighbouring
Swi&s;s cantons, an in&s;tructive contra&s;t, which mu&s;t &s;en&s;ibly
endear to them their own invaluable happine&s;s, in the com|merce
and liberties which they enjoy.</P>
<P>WE paid a vi&s;it to the chamber where the council of Con|&s;tance
was held in 1415, and had the honour of &s;itting in the
two chairs, in which &s;at pope John XXIII.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He was depo&s;ed in this council.</NOTE> and the emperor
Sigi&s;mond; if any honour can be derived from a turbulent
eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and a perjured &s;overeign. It was by a &s;entence
of this council, that the celebrated reformer John Hu&s;s (hav|ing
embraced the doctrines of our Wickliffe, and tru&s;ting to
the protection of the emperor, who violated his word) was
burnt as an heretic. The hou&s;e is &s;till &s;hewn where he was
&s;eized, and upon which is fixed his head, carved in &s;tone,
but now almo&s;t defaced; with an in&s;cription under it in
German. Jerome of Prague, his di&s;ciple, had the weakne&s;s
to recant before the &s;ame council, but this weakne&s;s was am|ply
<PB N="15" REF="32">
compen&s;ated by the greatne&s;s of &s;oul with which he again
retracted this recantation, and by the calm and intrepid mag|nanimity
which he di&s;played in his la&s;t moments at the &s;take.
From the top of the cathedral we had a &s;uperb view of the
town, and of the two lakes; with the rugged Alps of Tyrol
and Appenzel, their tops covered with perpetual &s;now.</P>
<P>CONSTANCE may again become a commercial town,
through the permi&s;&s;ion granted by the emperor, to the emi|grants
from Geneva, of &s;ettling and carrying on their trade
and manufactures, with very con&s;iderable privileges. Me&s;&s;rs.
Roman and Meilly, watchmakers of Geneva, were the fir&s;t
per&s;ons, whom the troubles of their native republic drove to
Con&s;tance. They received from the emperor the following
immunities for them&s;elves and countrymen.</P>
<P>THE right of purcha&s;ing or building hou&s;es; free exer|ci&s;e
of religion, entirely independent of the Catholic clergy;
the power of erecting a tribunal for the purpo&s;e of deciding
all affairs relative to their manufactures and commerce; ex|emption
from &s;erving in the militia and quartering &s;oldiers;
from all contributions during the &s;pace of twenty years;
from duties on their tools and uten&s;ils; and the &s;tandard of
the gold and &s;ilver employed in their manufactures to be in|variably
fixed. The&s;e favourable terms, &s;igned on the 30th
of June, 1785, attracted many &s;ettlers to Con&s;tance; and in
my &s;econd vi&s;it to this place, on the 25th of October, 1787,
the new colony of Genevans con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy families,
compri&s;ing three hundred and fifty per&s;ons; among the&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="33">
were fifty-four watchmakers, who had introduced the dif|ferent
branches of manufacture which belong to their trade.
Four hundred watches were already fini&s;hed, and above
fourteen hundred more were preparing. The emperor has
al&s;o granted to Mr. Macaire the convent of Dominicans lately
&s;ecularized, towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a manufacture of printed
linens and cottons. The refectory is appropriated for the
chapel of the new colony.</P>
<P>I DID not omit vi&s;iting a &s;mall dungeon, about eight feet
long, &s;ix broad, and &s;even high, in which John Hu&s;s was
confined, and wherein I ob&s;erved the very &s;tone to which he
had been chained. I entered it however with very different
&s;en&s;ations from tho&s;e which I experienced in 1776, when
this convent was the a&s;ylum of monki&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. It is
now the &s;eat of trade and indu&s;try: and it mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t a
plea&s;ing reflection to a philo&s;ophic mind, that a &s;ucce&s;&s;or of
Sigi&s;mond, who violated his word, &s;hould have con&s;igned to
a reformed e&s;tabli&s;hment that very convent in which the Bo|hemian
divine was impri&s;oned, and from which he was ex|ultingly
led to the &s;take; and that the mo&s;t enlarged princi|ples
of toleration &s;hould be manife&s;ted in the &s;ame place,
where per&s;ecution was inculcated by precept and example.
It is the triumph of rea&s;on and religion over bigotry and in|tolerance.</P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from a plea&s;ant expedition to the &s;mall
i&s;land of Meinau, in a bay of the &s;uperior lake: this i&s;land,
about a mile in circumference, belongs to the knights of the
<PB N="17" REF="34">
Teutonic order. The bailiff &s;hewed us the hou&s;e of the
commander, which is prettily &s;ituated, and has a fine pro&s;pect
of the lake, but contains nothing remarkable but the cellars,
which are well &s;tocked with wine; an article from which the
chief revenue of the commandery ari&s;es. Our good friend
the bailiff was very free in offering it; and we, not to appear
in&s;en&s;ible of his civility, were con&s;trained to ta&s;te &s;everal
different &s;orts, which he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre&s;ented, always prai&s;|ing
the la&s;t as the olde&s;t and mo&s;t exqui&s;ite. The wine was
indeed excellent, the gla&s;&s;es large, and a mo&s;t formidable
row of enormous ca&s;ks &s;till remained unta&s;ted; &s;o that, after
having duly extolled &s;everal &s;pecimens, we found it expe|dient
to decline the farther &s;olicitations of our generous
ho&s;t: for, had we performed the whole ceremony, we mu&s;t
have taken up our abode in the ca&s;tle for the night.</P>
<P><DATE>July 25.</DATE></P>
<P>WE &s;et &s;ail about two hours ago from Con&s;tance. This
&s;uperior lake, or, as it is &s;ometimes called, the <HI>Boden See,</HI> is
about fifteen leagues in length and &s;ix in its greate&s;t breadth:
it is one of the great boundaries that &s;eparate Switzerland
from Germany. The borders on each &s;ide con&s;i&s;t of gently
ri&s;ing hills; on the left hand Suabia, and on the right Thur|gau,
with a variety of &s;cattered towns, villages, and mona&s;|teries:
the form of the lake inclines to an oval, and the
water is of a greeni&s;h hue. I am now writing aboard the
ve&s;&s;el; and have been for &s;ome time in vain attempting to
di&s;tingui&s;h (what &s;ome travellers have a&s;&s;irmed to be di&s;|cernable)
the waters of the Rhine from tho&s;e of the lake;
though indeed I was before almo&s;t convinced of the impo&s;|&s;ibility.
<PB N="18" REF="35">
For the river in its cour&s;e from the &s;uperior lake,
being exactly of the &s;ame beautiful greeni&s;h colour as the
inferior lake into which it flows; it is evident that the one
can never be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other. Probably, upon
its fir&s;t entrance into the &s;uperior lake it is troubled, and
con&s;equently, for &s;ome way, its current may ea&s;ily be traced:
but it purifies by degrees, and becomes an indi&s;tinct part of
the great body of water.</P>
<P>THIS lake, like all the other lakes of Switzerland, is con|&s;iderably
deeper in &s;ummer than in winter; a circum&s;tance
owing to the fir&s;t melting of the &s;now from the neighbour|ing
mountains: it abounds in fi&s;h of various &s;orts. Ye&s;ter|day
evening, in our expedition to Meinau, there was &s;carcely
a breeze &s;tirring, and the lake was as &s;mooth as chry&s;tal; a
bri&s;k gale has now rai&s;ed a fine curl upon the &s;urface; and
the &s;urrounding land&s;cape forms an a&s;&s;emblage of the mo&s;t
beautiful objects. In &s;hort, the &s;everal views which pre&s;ent
them&s;elves are &s;o truly enchanting, as to make me regret
every moment that my eyes are called off from the delight|ful
&s;cenes. You will not wonder, therefore, if I am tempted
to bid you adieu &s;omewhat abruptly.</P>

<P>P. S. The following de&s;cription of the great trout, which
frequents all the Swi&s;s lakes, but more particularly abounds
in the lake of Con&s;tance, was communicated by Thomas
Pennant, E&s;q. This &s;pecies of trout is called in this neigh|bourhood
<HI>Illankin,</HI> and by Linnaeus, <HI>Salmo Lacu&s;tris.</HI> The
<PB N="19" REF="36">
head is conical, and larger in proportion than that of a &s;al|mon.
The dor&s;al fin has twelve rays; pectoral, fourteen;
ventral and anal, twelve each. The under jaw, in full-grown
fi&s;h, ends in a blunt hook. The colour, as low as the lateral
line, of a deep blue, brightening as it approaches the line;
beneath that, of a &s;ilvery white; all the upper part is &s;potted
irregularly with black. This kind grows to the weight of
forty or forty-five pounds.</P>
<P>THESE fi&s;hes quit the deeps of the lake in April, and go
up the Rhine to depo&s;it their &s;pawn. The inhabitants of
the &s;hores form wears acro&s;s the river, in which they take
them in their pa&s;&s;age. They are al&s;o caught in nets. The
fi&s;hery la&s;ts from May to September; the fi&s;hermen avoid
taking any on the return, as they are then very lean and
quite exhau&s;ted. In &s;pring and &s;ummer their fle&s;h is of a
fine red, and very delicate; but after they have &s;pawned, it
turns white and becomes very indifferent. They feed on
fi&s;h, worms, and in&s;ects; and are particularly de&s;tructive to
the graylings. Their great enemy is the Pike, which will
attack an Illankin four times as large as it&s;elf. For a fur|ther
account, the reader may con&s;ult the elegant Icthyolo|gie
by Mr. Block, vol. iii. p. 155, who is the fir&s;t naturali&s;t that
has given &s;atisfactory account of this gigantic &s;pecies</P>

walking &s;ix miles over the mountains of Appenzel.</P>
<P>WE this day quitted St. Gallen, and walked to Appenzel.
The country is &s;ingularly wild and romantic; con&s;i&s;ting of a
continued &s;eries of hills and dales, vallies and mountains, the
tops of which are crowned with mo&s;t luxuriant pa&s;tures. I

for a &s;hort time in this delightful &s;pot, I cannot em|ploy
my&s;elf more to my &s;atisfaction than by continuing my
journal.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="38">
IN my la&s;t letter I took my leave of you upon the lake of
Con&s;tance: we landed at Ro&s;hach, a &s;mall burgh in the do|minions
of the abbot of St. Gallen, agreeably &s;ituated in the
mid&s;t of a bay at the edge of the lake, and at the bottom of
a ri&s;ing hill, richly covered with wood and pa&s;turages. From
Ro&s;hach we went to St. Gallen, the whole territory whereof
does not exceed a mile and a half in circumference; and in|cluding
the town contains near eight thou&s;and inhabitants.
There every thing was alive; all per&s;ons wore the appear|ance
of indu&s;try and activity; exhibiting a &s;triking oppo&s;i|tion
to Con&s;tance, which we had ju&s;t quitted.</P>
<P>THE abbot and town of St. Gallen are both allies of the
Swi&s;s cantons, and each enjoys the privilege of &s;ending de|puties
to the general diet. The abbot of St. Gallen is titular
prince of the German empire, and is cho&s;en by the &s;eventy-two
Benedictines, who compo&s;e this chapter. He formerly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;overeignty of the town; but the inhabitants
&s;hook off his authority, and became independent: and the
various di&s;putes which, &s;ince that period, have ari&s;en be|tween
the two rival parties, have been compromi&s;ed by the
interpo&s;ition of the Swi&s;s cantons. The town is entirely
Prote&s;tant, and its government ari&s;to-democratical: the &s;ub|jects
of the abbot (who&s;e territory is very exten&s;ive) are
mo&s;tly Catholics. It is remarkable, that the abbey in which
the prince re&s;ides, is &s;ituated clo&s;e to the town, and in the
mid&s;t of its territory; as the town is al&s;o entirely &s;urrounded
by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the prince.</P>
<P>ST. GALLEN owes its flouri&s;hing &s;tate to the uncommon
indu&s;try of the inhabitants, and to a very exten&s;ive com|merce,
<PB N="22" REF="39">
ari&s;ing chiefly from its manufactures of linen, mu&s;lin,
and embroidery. In a place &s;o entirely commercial, I was
a&s;toni&s;hed to find the arts and &s;ciences cultivated, and litera|ture
in the highe&s;t e&s;teem. In the library there are thirteen
volumes in folio, containing manu&s;cript letters of the fir&s;t
German and Swi&s;s reformers. Luther ends a letter to Me|lancthon
as follows:
<Q>Pe&s;tis eram vivus, moriens ero mors tua, Papa.</Q>
The&s;e letters would probably throw much light on the hi&s;tory
of the reformation.</P>
<P>THE library belonging to the abbey is very numerous and
well arranged; and, among a number of monki&s;h manu|&s;cripts,
contains &s;everal of the cla&s;&s;ic writers, which engaged
my chief attention. To this library we owe Petronius Ar|biter,
Silius Italicus, Valerius Flaccus, and Quintilian, copies
of which were found in 1413: it was formerly very rich in
curious manu&s;cripts; but &s;everal being borrowed, during
the council of Con&s;tance, by the cardinals and bi&s;hops, were
never returned.</P>
<P>THE tran&s;ition from the abbot of St. Gallen to the canton
of Appenzel will not appear abrupt, as Appenzel once be|longed
to the abbot: the inhabitants, however, being loaded
with exorbitant and oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, revolted in 1400; and
maintained their independence with the de&s;perate courage
of a &s;pirited people, who &s;ight for their liberties. In 1452
they entered into a perpetual alliance with &s;ome of the neigh|bouring
Swi&s;s republics; and in 1513 were admitted into the
<PB N="23" REF="40">
Helvetic confederacy: they hold the la&s;t rank among the
thirteen cantons.</P>
<P>BEFORE the reformation the whole canton was under
one government; but &s;ince that period, part of the inhabi|tants
having embraced the Prote&s;tant religion, and the other
part continuing Catholics, violent di&s;putes were kindled be|tween
them; which, after much conte&s;t, were at length
compromi&s;ed. By an agreement in 1597, the canton was
divided into two portions; <HI>Rhodes Exterior,</HI> and <HI>Rhodes In|terior:</HI>
it was &s;tipulated, that the former &s;hould be appro|priated
to the Prote&s;tants, and the latter to the Catholics.
Accordingly the two parties finally &s;eparated, and formed
two republics; their government, police, and finances, being
totally independent of each other. Each di&s;trict &s;ends a de|puty
to the general diet: the whole canton, however, has
but one vote, and lo&s;es its &s;uffrage if the two parties are not
unanimous. In both divi&s;ions the &s;overeign power is ve&s;ted
in the people at large; every male, who is pa&s;t &s;ixteen, hav|ing
a vote in their general a&s;&s;embly, held yearly for the crea|tion
of their magi&s;trates and the purpo&s;es of legi&s;lation: and
each voter is obliged to appear armed on that particular oc|ca&s;ion.
The Landamman is the fir&s;t magi&s;trate: in each
di&s;trict there are two, who admini&s;ter the office alternately,
and are confirmed yearly. They have each a council, which
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es juri&s;diction in civil and criminal cau&s;es, has the care
of the police, the management of the finances, and the ge|neral
admini&s;tration of affairs. The Landamman regent
pre&s;ides; and the other, during the year in which he is out
of office, is banneret of chief of the militia.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="41">
THE <HI>Rhodes Exterior</HI> is much larger, and more peopled
in proportion, than the <HI>Interior;</HI> and the Prote&s;tants are in
general more commercial and indu&s;trious than the Catho|lics.&mdash;The
Prote&s;tants are &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to thirty-&s;even
thou&s;and; the Catholics to twelve thou&s;and: an extraordi|nary
number in &s;o &s;mall a canton, entirely mountainous, and
of which a great part con&s;i&s;ts of barren and inacce&s;&s;ible rocks.
But the indu&s;try of the inhabitants amply compen&s;ates for
any di&s;advantages of &s;oil: for, the people are frugal and labo|rious;
their property is &s;ecured; and they are exempted
from all burden&s;ome and arbitrary taxes. The&s;e circum|&s;tances,
joined to the right of partaking of the legi&s;lation,
and of electing their magi&s;trates, in&s;pire them with &s;uch ani|mated
&s;entiments of their own importance and independence,
as excite the mo&s;t active and vigorous indu&s;try: and tho&s;e
nece&s;&s;aries, to which this indu&s;try is not &s;ufficient, are abun|dantly
&s;upplied by their neighbours, in exchange for manu|factures
and other articles of dome&s;tic commerce. The chief
part of the habitable country con&s;i&s;ts of rich pa&s;tures; and
of cour&s;e their principal exports are cattle and hides, toge|ther
with chee&s;e and butter. Their manufactures are coar&s;e
callicots and mu&s;lins in great quantities, which are entirely
made in the hou&s;es of the inhabitants. The cotton is &s;pun
with the common wheel. The web is bleached at home;
and afterwards &s;ent to be printed in the neighbourhood of
Neuchatel. The greate&s;t bleachery I &s;aw in the Alps was
near Appenzel, which extended over three or four acres of
ground. Part of the river Sitler is diverted to turn the mill,
which is of the &s;imple&s;t con&s;truction. A large wheel on the
out&s;ide works a long cylinder within; on which are &s;ixed a
<PB N="25" REF="42">
number of cogs to rai&s;e the hammers which beat the webs.
In the &s;ame place are the boilers and other conveniences for
the bu&s;ine&s;s. The only water-mills for &s;pinning cotton which
I &s;aw in Switzerland, were near Neuchatel and Geneva; but
greatly inferior in &s;ize and ingenuity of machinery to tho&s;e
of England. The flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the cotton manufac|tory
has rendered many per&s;ons in the Prote&s;tant di&s;tricts
ea&s;y in their circum&s;tances, and even wealthy; if wealth is
to be e&s;timated from the general &s;tate of the natives, and not
from the comparative view of di&s;tant and greater opulence
in large commercial cities. The villages of Trogen and Un|devil
announce, by their &s;uperior neatne&s;s, the well-being
of their inhabitants.</P>
<P>THIS canton contains no enclo&s;ed towns, but only two or
three open burghs, of which Appenzel is the large&s;t in the
Catholic, Trogen, Undevil, and Heri&s;au, in the Prote&s;tant
di&s;trict, and a few villages: indeed the whole country, ex|cept
among&s;t the barren rocks, is almo&s;t a continued village,
being thickly covered with excellent cottages. Each cottage
has its little territory, or a field or two of fine pa&s;ture ground,
which are frequently &s;kirted with trees. The mountains are
for the mo&s;t part beautifully wooded; and the canton is &s;up|plied
with water in &s;uch abundance, that we could hardly
walk two hundred paces without &s;eeing a &s;pring bubble from
the ground, or a torrent ru&s;h down the &s;ides of a rock.</P>
<P>IN our way to Appenzel, we entered &s;everal hou&s;es,
which are all built of wood; neatne&s;s and convenience being
the principal object of the owners: &s;uch a remarkable clean|line&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="43">
prevailed throughout, as afforded a mo&s;t &s;triking proof
of the general attention which the people pay to that e&s;&s;en|tial
article. A continued chain of the&s;e cultivated moun|tains,
richly clothed with wood, and thickly &s;tudded with
hamlets, which appear to have been placed by the genius of
ta&s;te in the very &s;pots where they would form the mo&s;t
&s;triking effect, exhibit a &s;eries of land&s;capes inexpre&s;&s;ibly
plea&s;ing: it &s;eemed as if they belonged to independent clans;
independent but &s;ocial, uniting for the great purpo&s;es of le|gi&s;lation,
and for the general pre&s;ervation of their liberties.</P>
<P>AMONG the chief part of the inhabitants, the original
&s;implicity of the pa&s;toral life is &s;till pre&s;erved; and I &s;aw &s;e|veral
venerable figures with long beards, that re&s;embled the
pictures of the antient patriarchs. The natives of this can|ton,
in common with the inhabitants of democracies, po&s;&s;e&s;s
a natural frankne&s;s, and peculiar tone of equality, which
ari&s;e from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own independence. They
al&s;o di&s;play a fund of original humour, and are remarkable
for great quickne&s;s of repartee, and rude &s;allies of wit,
which render their conver&s;ation extremely agreeable and in|tere&s;ting.</P>
<P>IN our way to Appenzel we pa&s;&s;ed through Tuffen, the
birth-place of Ulric Grubenman<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See p. 8.</NOTE>: he has been dead &s;ome
years: but his abilities and his &s;kill in practical architecture
are, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, hereditary in his family.
We inquired for one of the &s;ame name, who was either his
<PB N="27" REF="44">
brother or his nephew, whom we found at the alehou&s;e;
his u&s;ual place of re&s;ort when he has no particular employ|ment.
He is a heavy, coar&s;e-looking man, dre&s;&s;ed like a
common pea&s;ant; has a quick and penetrating eye, and a
&s;urpri&s;ing readine&s;s of conver&s;ation. We told him that we
were Engli&s;hmen, who were making the tour of Switzer|land;
and that we could not pa&s;s through Tuffen without
de&s;iring to &s;ee a man who was &s;o much celebrated for his
&s;kill in architecture. He &s;truck his brea&s;t, and replied in
German, &startq;Here you &s;ee but a boor.&endq; Upon our talking
with him about the bridge of Schaffhau&s;en, in the building
of which he was employed, he a&s;&s;ured us, that it does not
re&s;t upon the middle pier, but is in reality a &s;ingle arch.
Near Appenzel we ob&s;erved an old man with venerable
white hair hanging over his &s;houlders, who looked like a
&s;ub&s;tantial farmer: he inquired with a tone of authority,
but with perfect civility, who we were; and upon our a&s;k|ing
the &s;ame que&s;tion re&s;pecting him&s;elf, of our guide, we
were informed, that he was the <HI>Landamman,</HI> or chief of the
republic. Happy people, the nature of who&s;e country, and
the con&s;titution of who&s;e government, both equally oppo&s;e

WALLENSTADT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Salets, <DATE>July 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are this moment arrived at the village of Salets;
where we propo&s;e pa&s;&s;ing the night: while &s;upper
is preparing, I will continue my journal. We could procure
but three hor&s;es at Appenzel, and as one of them was ap|propriated
to the baggage, I preferred walking. After hav|ing
traver&s;ed a league in the canton, over a continued range
of mountains, enriched with beautiful meadows, and dotted
with cottages, I arrived at its boundary; here the &s;cene &s;ud|denly
changed into a wild fore&s;t of pines, without the lea&s;t
appearance of any habitation. The road is &s;carcely more
than three feet broad; and is either paved with large uneven
pieces of rock, or formed with thick &s;takes laid clo&s;ely toge|ther:
but as the ground is in many parts &s;oft, the&s;e &s;takes
in &s;ome places &s;ink deeper, and form a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of uneven
&s;teps. The mountain by which we de&s;cended into the plain,
is very &s;teep; which circum&s;tance, added to the unevenne&s;s
of the &s;takes, makes the a&s;cent and de&s;cent exceedingly dif|ficult
for hor&s;es. Tho&s;e who are plea&s;ed with an uniform
view, may continue in the plain; while others, who delight
in the grand and the &s;ublime, and are &s;truck with the wan|tonne&s;s
of wild, uncultivated nature, will prefer this road to
the &s;moothe&s;t turnpike in Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="46">
I WALKED &s;lowly on, without envying my companions
on hor&s;eback: for I could &s;it down upon an inviting &s;pot,
climb to the edge of a precipice, or trace a torrent by its
&s;ound. I de&s;cended at length into the <HI>Rheinthal,</HI> or Valley
of the Rhine; the mountains of Tyrol, which yielded nei|ther
in height or in craggine&s;s to tho&s;e of Appenzel, ri&s;ing
before me. And here I found a remarkable difference: for
although the a&s;cending and de&s;cending was a work of &s;ome
labour; yet the variety of the &s;cenes had given me &s;pirits,
and I was not &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t fatigue. But in the plain,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;cenery was &s;till beautiful and pictu|re&s;que,
I &s;aw at once the whole way &s;tretching before me,
and had no room for fre&s;h expectations: I was not therefore
di&s;plea&s;ed when I arrived at Oberried, after a walk of about
twelve miles, my coat &s;lung upon my &s;houlder like a peri|patetic
by profe&s;&s;ion. Here we procured a narrow cart; in
which, the roads being rough and &s;tony, you will readily
believe we were not much at our ea&s;e. The evening how|ever
being fine, and the moon exceedingly bright, our jour|ney
was not altogether di&s;agreeable; as it led us through a
delightful country abounding in vines, fruit-trees, flax, and
pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>THE Rheinthal is a bailliage belonging to Appenzel and
the eight antient cantons, which alternately appoint a bailif.
The people are of both religions, but the Prote&s;tants are the
mo&s;t numerous.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Wallen&s;tadr, <DATE>July 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE quitted Salets this morning, in the &s;ame cart in
which we arrived; and it would have afforded matter of
&s;ome &s;peculation, to ob&s;erve how we contrived to arrange
our&s;elves, our &s;ervants, a large Newfoundland dog, and the
baggage, in &s;o narrow a compa&s;s: indeed we were &s;o wedged
in, that, after we had once fixed our&s;elves in our &s;everal
places, it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tir. The day was &s;ultry,
and the &s;un powerful, the road bad, and the cart went barely
at the rate of three miles an hour; but the country &s;till con|tinued
&s;o picture&s;que and mountainous; and our attention
was &s;o entirely engaged with the perpetual variety of objects
pre&s;ented to our view, as to make us forget the inconvenien|cies
of our equipage, and the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the weather.
From Trivabach, a &s;mall village upon the Rhine, we walked
to Sargans, the capital of a bailliage of the &s;ame name, be|longing
to the eight antient cantons.</P>
<P>LET me here remark, that in Switzerland there are two
&s;orts of bailliages: the one con&s;i&s;ting of certain di&s;tricts, into
which all the ari&s;tocratical cantons are divided; and over
the&s;e a particular officer, called a <HI>bailif,</HI> is appointed by go|vernment,
to which he is accountable for his admini&s;tra|tion:
the other &s;ort are the territories that do not make part
of the cantons, but are &s;ubject to two or more of them, who
by turns appoint a bailif. This officer, when not re&s;trained
by the peculiar privilege of certain di&s;tricts, has the care of
the police, juri&s;diction in civil and criminal cau&s;es, with &s;ome
limitations; and enjoys a &s;tated revenue ari&s;ing in different
<PB N="31" REF="48">
places from various duties and taxes. In ca&s;e of exaction or
mal-admini&s;tration, an appeal always lies from the bailif to
the cantons, to which the bailliage belongs: and the place,
the time, and the members who receive the appeal are regu|lated
with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s. With re&s;pect to this of Sar|gans,
and the others belonging to the eight antient cantons
conjointly; at the conclu&s;ion of the general diet held annu|ally
at Frauenfield in Thurgau, the deputies of the&s;e cantons
re&s;olve them&s;elves into a Syndicate, examine the accounts of
the public revenues as delivered by the bailifs of the re&s;pec|tive
di&s;tricts, and receive and judge all appeals; in &s;ome ca&s;es
finally; but in the more important cau&s;es an appeal lies from
this a&s;&s;embly to the &s;uperior tribunal of each canton. The
theory of this in&s;titution, has a plau&s;ible appearance of im|partiality:
but how far the practice accords with the theory,
I cannot pretend to determine. Whether a bailif, who is
guilty of extortion, is ea&s;ily brought to ju&s;tice, or more ea&s;ily
&s;creened? how far the members of the Syndicate are liable
to influence, or open to corruption? how far the expence of
appeals renders them in many ca&s;es impracticable to the
poorer inhabitants? are que&s;tions which cannot be an&s;wered
but by a per&s;on well informed concerning the&s;e courts of
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>WE arrived late at Wallen&s;tadt, a town incorporated into
the bailliage of Sargans, but enjoying &s;everal di&s;tinct privi|leges:
it derives its exi&s;tence from the pa&s;&s;age of the mer|chandi&s;e
tran&s;ported from Germany through the Gri&s;ons to
Italy. This communication occa&s;ions the frequent re&s;ort of
Italian merchants; and that language is under&s;tood by many
<PB N="32" REF="49">
of the inhabitants. Our landlord &s;peaks Italian, and has
been very accurate in his an&s;wers to my que&s;tions relating
to the number of inhabitants, the government of the town,
its dependence upon the bailif, and its privileges. Nor is this
a matter of wonder: for the innkeepers in Switzerland are
mo&s;tly <HI>burghers,</HI> and are frequently members of the &s;ove|reign
council; and, from the very nature of their govern|ments,
the Swi&s;s in general are well informed of their parti|cular
con&s;titutions. I have al&s;o held a long conver&s;ation
with a native of Glarus, who has furni&s;hed me with much
information in relation to that canton: which we purpo&s;e
vi&s;iting to-morrow.</P>

<P>THE lake of Wallen&s;tadt, about twelve miles in length,
and two in breadth, is entirely bounded by high mountains,
except to the ea&s;t and we&s;t. From this &s;ituation, a breeze
generally blows from tho&s;e two quarters, beginning at break
of day, and continuing for &s;ome hours; then changes from
we&s;t to ea&s;t till &s;un-&s;et: this breeze is very convenient for
the tran&s;portation of the merchandi&s;e. Sometimes however
a violent north-wind ru&s;hes down from the mountains, and
renders the navigation dangerous. We were a&s;&s;ured by the
inhabitants, and by the waterman who rowed us from Wal|len&s;tadt
to this place, that the breeze was generally con&s;tant:
but we cannot atte&s;t it from our own experience; as we &s;et
out this morning about eight, and the wind was directly
contrary the whole way, blowing from we&s;t to ea&s;t. The
weather, it is true, was heavy, overca&s;t, and rainy, which
might cau&s;e perhaps this occa&s;ional variation.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="50">
THE &s;cenery of the lake is uncommonly wild and pictu|re&s;que,
and affords a perpetual variety of beautiful and
romantic &s;cenes. On the &s;ide of Glarus, the mountains
which form its borders, are chiefly cultivated; enriched with
wood or fine meadows; and &s;tudded with cottages, churches,
and &s;mall villages; the Alps of Glarus ri&s;ing behind, their
tops covered with &s;now. On the other &s;ide, for the mo&s;t
part, the rocks are grote&s;que, craggy, inacce&s;&s;ible, and per|pendicular:
but here and there a few cultivated necks of
land are formed at the very edge of the lake, and at the
bottom of the&s;e very rocks; exhibiting a beautiful contra&s;t
to the barrenne&s;s above and around them. Numberle&s;s
water-falls, occa&s;ioned by the melting of the &s;nows, fall down
the &s;ides of the mountains from a very con&s;iderable height,
and with an almo&s;t inconceivable variety; &s;ome of them
&s;eeming to glide gently in circular directions; others forming
va&s;t torrents, and ru&s;hing into the lake with noi&s;e and
violence: all of them changing their form and their po&s;ition
as we approached or receded from them. The lake is ex|ceedingly
clear, deep, and cold, and, as we were informed,
is never frozen.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing remarkable in this place; being a &s;mall
village &s;ituated almo&s;t upon the point where the Mat i&s;&s;ues
from the lake of Wallen&s;tadt: that little river is joined by
the Linth, and both united fall, under the name of Limmat,
into the lake of Zuric.</P>

inhabitants. Towards the latter end of the thirteenth
century, the emperor Rodolph I. obtained the exclu&s;ive ad|mini&s;tration
of ju&s;tice; and not long afterwards his &s;on
Albert, having purcha&s;ed the mayoralty, which had gradually
become hereditary, re-united in his per&s;on the whole civil
and judicial authority. Accordingly that prince, and his
immediate de&s;cendants the dukes of Au&s;tria, oppre&s;&s;ed the
people, and ruled over them with an ab&s;olute &s;way. In 1350,
Schweitz, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Zuric, Lucerne, Uri, and Underwalden,
expelled the Au&s;trians from the canton of Glarus, and re|e&s;tabli&s;hed
the democracy. Glarus then entered into a per|petual
alliance with its deliverers, and was received into the
Helvetic confederacy with &s;ome re&s;trictions, which were not
aboli&s;hed until 1450. At that time it was the &s;ixth canton,
but is now the la&s;t in rank of the eight <HI>antient</HI> cantons, as
they are called; being &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e, from the
acce&s;&s;ion of Zug and Berne in 1352, more than a century
clap&s;ed before a new member was admitted. The&s;e <HI>antient</HI>
<PB REF="52">

<PB N="35" REF="53">
cantons have al&s;o &s;everal privileges &s;uperior to the five others;
the latter having &s;ubmitted to &s;ome particular re&s;trictions,
upon their reception into the Helvetic league.</P>
<P>THE people of Glarus enjoyed their liberties unmole&s;ted
till 1388, when the Au&s;trians made an irruption into the
canton, with a force &s;ufficient, as they arrogantly thought,
totally to &s;ubdue it; pillaging the country, and ma&s;&s;acring
the inhabitants. It was then that three hundred and fifty
troops of Glarus, and thirty Switzers, po&s;ted advantageou&s;ly
upon the mountains, re&s;i&s;ted the whole &s;trength of the
Au&s;trian army, to the number of fifteen thou&s;and, at a village
called Naefels. In this &s;ituation the Au&s;trians began the
attack; but were &s;oon compelled to retreat with great pre|cipitation,
by a &s;hower of &s;tones poured upon them from the
heights: in this moment of confu&s;ion, the inhabitants ru&s;hed
down upon the enemy with &s;uch fury, that they broke their
ranks; and, after an immen&s;e &s;laughter, forced the remainder
to retire from the canton. Such &s;urpri&s;ing victories, gained
by a handful of men again&s;t an enemy &s;o much &s;uperior in
number (in&s;tances of which are by no means rare in the
hi&s;tory of Switzerland) render the wonderful combats of
Marathon and Plataea, when the Greeks repul&s;ed the nu|merous
ho&s;ts of the whole Per&s;ian empire, perfectly credible.
The &s;ame love of independence, the &s;ame dread of &s;lavery,
and the &s;ame attachment to their country, animated the re|&s;pective
nations to the &s;ame deeds of heroi&s;m; and in both
in&s;tances victory was followed by the &s;ame glorious con|&s;equences:
for the Swi&s;s, as well as the Greeks, owe the ri&s;e
and pre&s;ervation of their liberties to that magnanimous and
<PB N="36" REF="54">
determined valour, which prefers death to living under the
&s;ervile domination of an arbitrary de&s;pot. The people &s;till
celebrate the anniver&s;ary of this victory, which in&s;ured their
independence: and I &s;aw near the village of Naefels &s;everal
&s;tones, with no other in&s;cription than 1388: an in&s;cription
which no more requires explanation, to an inhabitant of the
canton, than the glorious aera of 1688, to an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ixteenth century, the reformation was introduced
into this canton, but not exclu&s;ively: both religions are
tolerated, and the two &s;ects live together in the greate&s;t
harmony; an union the more remarkable, when we con&s;ider
the fatal quarrels that have been kindled in Switzerland on
account of religious tenets; and that in Appenzel the divi&s;ion
between the two &s;ects is di&s;tinctly marked by their inhabiting
different di&s;tricts, and living under &s;eparate governments.
In &s;everal parts of this canton, the Prote&s;tants and Catholics
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively perform &s;ervice in the &s;ame church; and all the
offices of &s;tate are amicably admini&s;tered by the two parties.
During the pre&s;ent and preceding century, the Prote&s;tants
have increa&s;ed con&s;iderably in number; and their indu&s;try,
in every branch of commerce, is greatly &s;uperior: an evident
proof how much the tenets of the Roman Catholic church
fetter the genius, and depre&s;s the powers of exertion.</P>
<P>THE government is entirely democratical: every per&s;on at
the age of &s;ixteen has a vote in the <HI>Land&s;gemeind,</HI> or general
a&s;&s;embly, which is annually held in an open plain. This
a&s;&s;embly ratifies new laws, lays contributions, enters into
alliances, declares war, and makes peace. The <HI>Landamman</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="55">
is the chief of the republic, and is cho&s;en alternately from
the two &s;ects; with this difference, that the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> remains
three years in office, the <HI>Catholic</HI> only two. The manner of
election is as follows: five candidates cho&s;en by the people
draw lots for the charge. The other great officers of &s;tate,
and the bailiffs, are taken al&s;o by lot from a certain number
of candidates propo&s;ed by the people. The executive power
is ve&s;ted in the council of regency, compo&s;ed of forty-eight
Prote&s;tants, and fifteen Catholics: each &s;ect has its particular
court of ju&s;tice; and it is nece&s;&s;ary, that in all law-&s;uits
between two per&s;ons of different religions, the per&s;on having
the ca&s;ting voice among the five or nine judges, who are to
determine the cau&s;e, &s;hould be of the &s;ame religion as the
defendant.</P>
<P>CATTLE, chee&s;e, and butter, con&s;titute the principal com|merce
of the canton. The cattle are fed in &s;ummer upon
the Alps: and it is computed, that ten thou&s;and head of
large cattle, and four thou&s;and &s;heep, are pa&s;tured during
that &s;ea&s;on upon the mountains belonging to the canton.
The inhabitants al&s;o manufacture linen and mu&s;lins.</P>
<P>AMONG the exports a con&s;iderable article is &s;late; with
which the canton abounds. The principal quarry is in the
valley of Sernft, where large &s;lates are dug up that &s;erve for
tables. The&s;e quarries, as I am informed by Mr. David
Pennant, once furni&s;hed Great Britain with &s;lates for writing,
or accomptants &s;lates; but this trade is entirely lo&s;t. Of late
they have been prepared from the great &s;late quarries in
Caernarvon&s;hire, the property of Lord Penryn; and with
<PB N="38" REF="56">
&s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, as bids fair to extend this article of commerce
over mo&s;t part of Europe.</P>
<P><DATE>July 30th.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned to Glarus, after having made an ex|cur&s;ion
towards the extremity of the canton: it is entirely
enclo&s;ed by the alps, except towards the north; and there is
no other entrance but through this opening, which lies
between the lake of Wallen&s;tadt and the mountains &s;epa|rating
this canton from that of Schweitz. Pa&s;&s;engers indeed
may in &s;ummer traver&s;e the&s;e alps to the Gri&s;ons on one
&s;ide, and to Uri on the other: but the&s;e paths are in winter
ab&s;olutely impracticable. At the entrance above-mentioned,
the canton reaches, from the banks of the Linth to the
farthe&s;t extremity of its alps, about thirty miles; forming a
valley, which becomes narrower as you advance, and is
&s;carcely more than a mu&s;ket-&s;hot in breadth at the burgh of
Glarus. It afterwards opens by degrees; and about a league
from Glarus, is divided by the Freyberg mountains: at the
point of this divi&s;ion the two rivers, Linth and Sernft,
unite.</P>
<P>WE continued through the large&s;t of the&s;e vallies, which,
though very narrow, is exceedingly populous. You have
been at Matlock in Derby&s;hire, and I remember your admi|ration
of its beautiful and romantic &s;ituation: the &s;cenery of
this valley is of the &s;ame ca&s;t, but infinitely more picture&s;que,
more wild, more varied, and more &s;ublime. The Linth is
much broader and more rapid than the Derwent; and the
hillocks of the Peake are mere mole-hills to the alps of
<PB N="39" REF="57">
Glarus. The&s;e &s;tupendous chains of rocks are ab&s;olutely
perpendicular, approach one another &s;o near and are &s;o high,
that the &s;un may be &s;aid to &s;et, even in &s;ummer, at four in
the afternoon. On each &s;ide are numbers of tho&s;e water|falls
we &s;o much admired during our pa&s;&s;age over the lake
of Wallen&s;tadt; one in particular, near the village of Ruti,
foamed down the &s;teep &s;ides of a mountain, from the mid&s;t
of a hanging grove of trees. I was &s;o captivated with the&s;e
enchanting &s;cenes, that I could not help &s;topping every
moment to admire them: and our guide, not conceiving it
po&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e delays could be owing to any other cau&s;e
than the lazine&s;s of the hor&s;e, never failed to &s;trike the poor
bea&s;t; and continually awakened me out of my rapturous
contemplations; and it was &s;ome time before I could make
him comprehend, that I &s;topped by choice, and wi&s;hed to
continue my own pace. After having rode about ten miles,
we quitted our hor&s;es and walked. Near Leugelbach, a con|&s;iderable
rivulet is formed by two &s;treams bur&s;ting from the
ground at the foot of a mountain, which after a few paces
unite, and fall into the Linth: be&s;ide the&s;e two principal
branches, &s;everal &s;maller &s;prings, and numberle&s;s little foun|tains,
gu&s;h from the rock.&mdash;The clearne&s;s of the &s;treams;
their rapidity and murmuring &s;ound; the trees that hang
over the point from whence they i&s;&s;ue; the rude rocks above;
the rich meadows and &s;cattered hamlets&mdash;all together form
an a&s;&s;emblage of the mo&s;t lively and plea&s;ing objects that
ever entered into a beautiful land&s;cape.</P>
<P>I AM informed by David Pennant, E&s;q. that Salmons
force their way annually from the &s;ea as high as this river,
<PB N="40" REF="58">
to depo&s;it their &s;pawn. Their progre&s;s is up the Rhine, and
out of that noble river up the Aar, and through the lake of
Zuric into the Linth; a cour&s;e of many hundred miles.
They are taken in the&s;e di&s;tant parts in September and
October, and about the &s;ize of &s;eventeen or twenty pounds
weight.</P>
<P>WE cro&s;&s;ed the Linth &s;everal times, which ru&s;hes with
all the violence of a torrent; and came at length to an am|phitheatre
of mountains, where the valley ended: on our
right-hand a torrent more con&s;iderable than any we had yet
&s;een, tumbling perpendicularly over a bare rock in a large
body of water; the alps on each &s;ide crowned with inac|ce&s;&s;ible
fore&s;ts, and covered with everla&s;ting &s;now; before
us a pyramidical mountain, bare and craggy; and the glaciers
of Glarus clo&s;ing the view. Here the valley, and the ha|bitable
part of the canton terminate. We then quitted the
plain, and a&s;cending through a wild fore&s;t of beech and pines,
continued more than an hour mounting a very &s;teep and
rugged path, till we came to the Panten-Bruck, a bridge
over the cataract that forms the Linth, which is here called
the Sand-bach: it roars from the glacier down the &s;teep
mountain in one unbroken fall; and, a little way before its
arrival under the bridge, works it&s;elf a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age
through the rock, where it is lo&s;t only to appear again with
increa&s;ed violence. The bridge is a &s;ingle arch of &s;tone,
about &s;eventy feet in length, thrown over a precipice more
than three hundred feet in depth. It &s;erves as a communica|tion
with the upper alps, and is the pa&s;&s;age for the cattle which
are fed there during the &s;ummer months; on the other &s;ide
<PB N="41" REF="59">
&s;ome goats came jumping around us, and &s;eemed to welcome
us to their dreary habitations. The&s;e mountains are covered
with a great variety of rare plants, which made me regret,
that I had not pur&s;ued my botanical &s;tudies. As I leaned
upon the parapet of the bridge, and looked down into the
cha&s;m, my head almo&s;t turned giddy with the height. The
rock, down which the Sand-bach drives, is compo&s;ed of &s;late.
After we had continued &s;ome time admiring the &s;ublime
horror of the &s;cenery, we de&s;cended into the valley, and
made a hearty meal upon &s;ome excellent bread, honey,
butter, and milk, which a neighbouring cottage &s;upplied.
As the canton almo&s;t entirely con&s;i&s;ts of rich meadows, the
milk and butter are delicious; and the honey of the&s;e moun|tainous
countries is mo&s;t exqui&s;ite. Nothing delights me
&s;o much as the in&s;ide of a Swi&s;s cottage: all tho&s;e I have
hitherto vi&s;ited, convey the livelie&s;t image of cleanline&s;s,
ea&s;e, and &s;implicity; and cannot but &s;trongly impre&s;s upon
the ob&s;erver a mo&s;t plea&s;ing conviction of the pea&s;ant's
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IF I had never &s;een the&s;e little democratical &s;tates, I could
have formed no idea of the general equality and indi&s;tinction
that prevails among the inhabitants. All the hou&s;es, like
tho&s;e of Appenzel, are built of wood; large, &s;olid, and com|pact,
with great penthou&s;e roofs that hang very low, and
extend beyond the area of the foundation. This peculiar
&s;tructure is of u&s;e to keep off the &s;now; and, from its
&s;ingularity, accords &s;urpri&s;ingly with the beautiful wild|ne&s;s
of the country. The hou&s;es of the richer inhabitants
<PB N="42" REF="60">
in the principal burghs, are of the &s;ame materials: the only
difference con&s;i&s;ts in their being larger.</P>
<P>IF that &s;ort of government be confe&s;&s;edly the be&s;t, which
con&s;titutes the greate&s;t good of the greate&s;t number in the
community; the&s;e little &s;tates, notwith&s;tanding the natural
defects of a democratical con&s;titution, may ju&s;tly claim a large
&s;hare of our approbation. General liberty, general indepen|dence,
and an exemption from arbitrary taxes, are ble&s;&s;ings
which amply compen&s;ate for a want of tho&s;e refinements
that are introduced by opulence and luxury. But it is only
in the&s;e &s;mall republics, and in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety, that
this kind of general democracy can have place. Although
the machine of government is con&s;iderably clogged by the
variety of wheels required to put it into motion; yet it is
not nece&s;&s;ary that its deci&s;ions &s;hould be &s;udden and expe|ditious:
for, as there is no fear of an inva&s;ion, and as the
people have no conque&s;ts either to make or to defend; their
principal policy con&s;i&s;ts in maintaining their independence,
and in pre&s;erving the public tranquillity. The police is well
regulated throughout Switzerland; and even in the&s;e demo|cratical
&s;tates, liberty does not often degenerate into licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s:
we may except, perhaps, the day of their general
a&s;&s;emblies, when it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent &s;ome degree of
confu&s;ion in a meeting where there is &s;carcely any di&s;tinction
of per&s;ons; and where every pea&s;ant con&s;iders him&s;elf as
equal to the fir&s;t magi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="61">
OUR ho&s;t is an open-hearted, hone&s;t Swi&s;s: he brings his
pint of wine, &s;its down to table with us, and chats without
the lea&s;t ceremony. There is a certain forwardne&s;s of this
kind which is in&s;upportable when it apparently is the effect
of impertinent curio&s;ity, or fawning officiou&s;ne&s;s; but the
pre&s;ent in&s;tance of frank familiarity, ari&s;ing from a mind
con&s;cious of natural equality, and uncon&s;trained by arbitrary
di&s;tinctions, is highly plea&s;ing; as the &s;imple demeanour of
un&s;ophi&s;ticated nature is far preferable to the fal&s;e refine|ments

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ABBEY OF EINSIDLIN&mdash;RAPPERSCHWYL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Ein&s;idlin, <DATE>July 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE could not pa&s;s through this part of the country,
without making a pilgrimage to Ein&s;idlin, and
paying our re&s;pects to this celebrated &s;hrine: an object of
much devotion among the Catholics. Ein&s;idlin, or <HI>Notre
Dame des Hermites,</HI> is a rich and magnificent abbey of Bene|dictines
in the canton of Schweitz, which owes its celebrity to
the miraculous image, as it is called, of the Virgin Mary.
The ridiculous tales they relate of the origin and aggran|dizement
of this abbey, are &s;o many melancholy in&s;tances of
the credulity of the darker ages: that they are &s;till believed
in the pre&s;ent enlightened century, mu&s;t be attributed to
the force of habitual prejudice; and at the &s;ame time proves,
how difficult it is for the human mind to &s;hake off tho&s;e
&s;uper&s;titutious errors, which it has early imbibed under the
name of religion.</P>
<P>IN the ninth century a certain hermit called Meinrad,
was the fir&s;t who retired to this place, where he built a
chapel, and was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by robbers. But &s;hall I tell you,
or (what is more to the purpo&s;e) will you believe me if I tell
you, that this murder was di&s;covered by two crows, who fol|lowed
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to Zuric, where they were &s;eized and exe|cuted?
<PB N="45" REF="63">
Soon after, the dead body of St. Meinrad of cour&s;e
works miracles; and all the world pilgrimi&s;es to his bones.
The &s;anctity of this place being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ome one
(for whether it were St. Benno or St. Eberhard, or what
other &s;aint I cannot preci&s;ely determine) con&s;tructed another
chapel, which he dedicated to the Virgin, and laid the fir&s;t
foundation of the abbey; having bequeathed for that purpo&s;e
his whole fortune: and the pious fund was &s;oon con&s;iderably
augmented by &s;ub&s;equent donations. Shall I tell you al&s;o,
that in 948, Conrad, bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance, as he was going to
con&s;ecrate the chapel, heard a voice from heaven, a&s;&s;uring
him, that God him&s;elf had con&s;ecrated it? Whatever was
its origin, and whoever was its founder; crouds of pilgrims
re&s;ort hither from all quarters to adore the Virgin, and to
pre&s;ent their offerings: and it is computed, that upon the
mo&s;t moderate calculation, their number amounts yearly to
100,000. The circumjacent country was formerly a conti|nued
fore&s;t, which &s;ince the foundation of the abbey has been
gradually converted into rich pa&s;tures and beautiful mea|dows:
and this is a miracle which the Virgin, in a certain
&s;en&s;e, may be truly &s;aid to have performed.</P>
<P><DATE>Augu&s;t 1.</DATE></P>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t been vi&s;iting the abbey, the chapel of the
Virgin, and her immen&s;e trea&s;ures. The church of the
abbey is a large and magnificent building, but exhibits a re|markable
&s;pecimen of fal&s;e ta&s;te, by being loaded with bad
paintings, and &s;uperfluous ornaments. In the aile not far
from the entrance, is a &s;mall and clegant marble chapel of
the Corinthian order: this is the celebrated &s;hrine of the
<PB N="46" REF="64">
Virgin, to which the pilgrims re&s;ort. On the out&s;ide an
angel &s;upports the following in&s;cription:
<Q>Hic e&s;t plena remi&s;&s;io peccatorum omnium a culp&acirc; et poen&acirc;.</Q>
Over the door is a plate of &s;ilver with five holes, into which
I &s;aw &s;everal per&s;ons thru&s;ting their fingers, and praying at
the &s;ame time with great fervour: upon inquiry I found,
that the credulous people believed the&s;e holes to be the marks
of God's fingers. In the in&s;ide of this chapel is the image of
the Virgin, which vies with the Lady of Loretto in <HI>beauty</HI> of
countenance; her face, as well as that of the child &s;he holds
in her arms, being black. She is richly apparelled, and
changes her garment every week; her wardrobe con&s;i&s;ting
of fifty-two different &s;uits.</P>
<P>THE riches of the trea&s;ury are immen&s;e; containing
numberle&s;s offerings of gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones,
arranged in the mo&s;t ridiculous manner; &s;kulls and bones
&s;umptuou&s;ly ornamented; whole &s;keletons of &s;aints in ma&s;|querade,
and of ladies with ruffles, fly-caps, and &s;plendid ap|parel
as if dre&s;&s;ed for a ball. What a wretched in&s;ult upon
poor human nature! I could not help con&s;idering them
with a mixture of pity and indignation, as the offerings of ig|norance
before the &s;hrine of bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition. The
miracles which the Virgin has wrought in this country are
infinite, if we may judge from the numerous figures of ears,
eyes, legs, arms, heads, &amp;c. pre&s;ented by tho&s;e, who fancied
them&s;elves re&s;pectively cured in tho&s;e &s;everal members, by
the power of this wonder-working image.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="65">
I WAS glad however to find, in the mid&s;t of this &s;uper|&s;titious
trumpery, a good library, which contained &s;ome fine
editions of the cla&s;&s;ics.</P>
<P>IN this place there is a con&s;iderable traffic in ro&s;aries,
cro&s;&s;es, and little images; and there are rows of &s;hops, where
nothing is to be purcha&s;ed but the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary appendages of
the Roman Catholic religion: it has all the appearance of a
fair. There is al&s;o a room in the abbey, where the &s;ame
kind of merchandi&s;e is expo&s;ed to &s;ale; and one of the friars
attends to receive your money, and very gravely a&s;&s;ures you,
that the &s;everal articles have touched the &s;acred image.
Among other curio&s;ities of this kind, I purcha&s;ed two rib|bands,
for two-pence each, with the following in&s;cription
upon them: <HI>Ce Ruban entier, e&s;t la longueur; ju&s;qu'au trait
e&s;t l'epai&s;&s;eur, de l'image de Notre Dame des Hermites. Il a
touch&eacute; l'image miraculeu&s;e.</HI> This abbey is very rich, and
has con&s;iderable revenues in the canton of Zuric. The
abbot, who is titular prince of the German empire, is elected
by &s;ixty Benedictines, that form the chapter.</P>
<P>AS I walked to this celebrated convent, I found the whole
way furni&s;hed with &s;talls provided with cakes, whey, and
other refre&s;hments for the numerous pilgrims then on their
road. I &s;aw &s;everal hundreds, in groups of different num|bers.
Some con&s;i&s;ted of a whole pari&s;h, attended by their
&s;piritual pa&s;tor. More than once, I ob&s;erved &s;ome grievous
&s;inner driven from the flock, and walking at a di&s;tance
counting his beads, bare-footed and bare-headed, doing full
penance for his crimes. I al&s;o &s;aw &s;everal bevies of merry
<PB N="48" REF="66">
dam&s;els, who &s;eemed to enjoy the pilgrimage as much as
Wel&s;h la&s;&s;es reli&s;h a wake. They often turned into the
little chapels which lay open on the way, and wantonly
&s;prinkled each other with holy water. This day's journey
reminded me of Chaucer's Tales, in which he exactly

<P>THE evening, ye&s;terday, being fine and cool, I walked
from Ein&s;idlin to this place. After we had a&s;cended about
three miles, a view of the lake of Zuric, and of the adjacent
country, opened upon us at once. The pro&s;pect was ex|ten&s;ive
and beautiful: the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s of the evening, the
calmne&s;s of the lake, and the tints of the &s;etting &s;un, which
glowed around the horizon, very much improved its charms.
When we arrived at the lake, the moon began to ri&s;e; and
throwing its beams acro&s;s the water, formed another &s;cene,
more mild indeed, but not le&s;s affecting. We then cro&s;&s;ed
the bridge of Rapper&s;chwyl, built over the narrowe&s;t part of
the lake: it mea&s;ured near 1700 paces. The town is plea|&s;antly
&s;ituated upon a neck of land or promontory. It for|merly
threw it&s;elf under the protection of Uri, Schweitz,
Underwalden, and Glarus, with a re&s;erve of all its privileges:
but the&s;e cantons &s;hamefully oppre&s;&s;ing the inhabitants, and
<PB N="49" REF="67">
encroaching upon their liberties; Zuric and Berne took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the town in 1712, and re&s;tored its antient immuni|ties.
From that period Rapper&s;chwyl has continued under
the protection of Zuric, Berne, and Glarus; the latter having
pre&s;erved its right by its neutrality. By this treaty the
town having recovered its former prerogatives, the inhabi|tants,
in te&s;timony of their gratitude, placed the following
in&s;cription over the gates: <HI>Amicis Tutoribus floret libertas.</HI></P>
<P>THIS &s;mall republic is governed by a great and little
council, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-eight members. The town con|tains
two hundred burghers, and about a thou&s;and inhabi|tants,
all Catholics. Its territory is about a league in cir|cumference,
and comprehends three pari&s;hes.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY we dined luxuriou&s;ly with the Capuchin
friars at Rapper&s;chwyl, who &s;eldom treat their gue&s;ts
in &s;o &s;umptuous a manner. It was one of their great fea&s;t-days;
and they regaled us with every variety of fi&s;h, with
which the lake and the neighbouring rivers abound. The
convent &s;tands upon the edge of the water, and commands
an agreeable pro&s;pect: the library is by far the plea&s;ante&s;t
apartment, though not the mo&s;t frequented. The cells of
the monks are &s;mall, and yet not inconvenient; but cleanli|ne&s;s
does not &s;eem to con&s;titute any part of their moral or
religious ob&s;ervances. Indeed the very habit of the order
is ill calculated for that purpo&s;e, as they wear no &s;hirt or
&s;tockings, and are clothed in a coar&s;e kind of brown drugget
robe, which trails upon the ground. Strange idea of &s;anctity!
as if dirt could be acceptable to the Deity. I reflected with
particular &s;atisfaction, that I was not born a member of the
Roman Catholic church; as perhaps the commands of a
parent, a &s;udden di&s;appointment, or a momentary &s;it of
enthu&s;ia&s;m, might have &s;ent me to a convent of Capuchins,
and have wedded me to dirt and &s;uper&s;tition for life.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner we took leave of our ho&s;ts, and departed
for Zuric by water: the lake is near ten leagues in length,
<PB N="51" REF="69">
and one in breadth. This body of water is of an oblong
form, and not near &s;o large as that of Con&s;tance; but the
borders are &s;tudded more thickly with villages and towns.
The adjacent country is finely cultivated and well peopled;
and the &s;outhern part of the lake appears bounded with the
high &s;tupendous mountains of Schweitz and Glarus: the
&s;cenery is picture&s;que, lively, and diver&s;ified.</P>
<P>ZURIC was formerly an imperial city, and obtained from
the emperor Frederic II. very con&s;iderable privileges; which
were acknowledged and augmented by &s;everal of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors.
The civil war between the magi&s;trates and the peo|ple,
in 1335, nearly reduced the city to ruins; but the magi|&s;trates
being bani&s;hed, the citizens, in 1337, e&s;tabli&s;hed a new
form of government, which was confirmed by the emperor
Louis of Bavaria. The exiles, after &s;everal fruitle&s;s attempts,
were at length re-admitted; but, engaging in a con&s;piracy
again&s;t the citizens, were di&s;covered and put to death. In
con&s;equence of this tran&s;action, the nobles in the neighbour|hood
took up arms; and Zuric, after having ineffectually ap|plied
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the emperor Charles IV. formed an alli|ance
with Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, and was
admitted a member of their confederacy. This event hap|pened
in the year 1351. The four cantons yielded the pre-emi|nence
to Zuric: a privilege it enjoys at pre&s;ent; being the fir&s;t
canton in rank, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in extent both of
territory and power next to Berne. In the &s;ame year Zuric
was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the four cantons again&s;t Albert duke of
Au&s;tria, who be&s;ieged the town, and was repul&s;ed with great
lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="70">
ZURIC was the fir&s;t town in Switzerland, that &s;eparated
from the church of Rome; being converted by the arguments
of Zuingle. Of all the reformers (the mild and elegant
Melancthon alone excepted) Zuingle &s;eems to merit peculiar
e&s;teem: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to a great degree, that &s;pirit of meek|ne&s;s,
moderation, and charity, which are the characteri&s;tics
of true Chri&s;tianity; and, amid all the di&s;putes between the
Lutherans and the reformed churches, was a con&s;tant advocate
for peace and reconciliation. He appears to have been as
perfectly free, as well from that narrow bigotry which makes
no di&s;tinction between points of the mere&s;t indifference, and
objects of the greate&s;t importance; as from that overbearing
pride, which, while it violently condemns the opinions of
others, a&s;&s;umes to it&s;elf infallibility with re&s;pect to its own.
In a word, it was his per&s;ua&s;ion, that, provided Chri&s;tians
agree in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles; they ought meekly to
bear with any difference upon &s;ubjects le&s;s uncontrovertible,
and which do not nece&s;&s;arily influence morals.</P>
<P>ULRIC Zuingle was born Jan. 1, 1484, at Wildhau&s;en, a
&s;mall village in the Tockenburgh; and, in the twentieth
year of his age, was appointed mini&s;ter of Glarus. Even
before the publication of the &s;ale of indulgences by Leo X.
which was the more immediate cau&s;e of the reformation&punc;
Zuingle had expo&s;ed at Glarus &s;everal &s;uper&s;titions of the
church of Rome; and had gained additional credit, by preach|ing
at Ein&s;idlin again&s;t vows, pilgrimages, and offerings.
After the publication of the &s;ale of indulgences; while Luther
was undermining the fabric of papal authority in Germany,
Zuingle was no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in Switzerland. By his zeal
<PB N="53" REF="71">
and intrepidity, and by the irre&s;i&s;tible force of truth, he
gained &s;o many converts at Zuric (where he had been invited
to preach) that in 1524 the magi&s;trates aboli&s;hed the ma&s;s,
and other Catholic ceremonies, and introduced the reformed
religion. Zuingle had taken &s;uch wi&s;e precautions, and
acted with &s;uch extreme moderation, that the di&s;putes
between the two &s;ects were carried on with more temper
than is u&s;ual in religious controver&s;ies. The change, which
had been &s;ome time in agitation, was finally determined by
a plurality of voices in the &s;overeign council; and the people
readily and cheerfully obeyed the deci&s;ion of their magi&s;trates.
The example of Zuric was &s;oon followed by Berne, Schaff|hau&s;en,
Ba&s;le, with part of Glarus and Appenzel; the other
cantons continuing to adhere to the religion of their an|ce&s;tors.
From this period the two per&s;ua&s;ions have been
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Switzerland; but that harmony, which had
hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the cantons, has been occa&s;ionally
interrupted. In 1531, religious di&s;putes broke out with &s;o
much violence, as to occa&s;ion a civil war; in which the Pro|te&s;tants
were defeated, and Zuingle lo&s;t his life, in the forty-eighth
year of his age, at the battle of Cappel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It has been urged again&s;t Zuingle, as a proof of his per&s;ecuting principles, that he was per&s;onally engaged in this war again&s;t the Catholics. To this it may be an&s;wered, That he had u&s;ed every argument in his power to reconcile the contending parties; that he even openly arraigned the impatient and turbulent zeal of his fellow-citizens; that he acted in obedience to one of the fundamental laws of the republic; and that he accompanied the army by the expre&s;s command of the magi&s;trates.</NOTE>. Since that
period two other religious wars have been kindled; one in
1656, in which the Catholics gained the advantage; and the
other in 1712, when the Prote&s;tants proved victorious. The
peace of Arau, which terminated the&s;e unhappy di&s;putes,
<PB N="54" REF="72">
has, it is to be hoped, finally compo&s;ed all religious animo&s;i|ties.
By that treaty, which may be con&s;idered as a code of
toleration among the Swi&s;s; the treatment of the Prote&s;tants
and Catholics in the common bailliages, is regulated. The
fir&s;t article &s;tipulates, that in all the provinces, which are
&s;ubject to cantons of different religion, there &s;hall be a
perfect equality between the two &s;ects, and that they &s;hall
both enjoy the &s;ame privileges: to which is added an ex|pre&s;s
prohibition to each party, not to u&s;e any terms of
raillery or contempt, in &s;peaking of their re&s;pective modes
of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE canton of Zuric abounds in corn, wine, and excellent
pa&s;ture. The proportion of grain to the other productions
of the earth, will appear from the following calculation.
There are 217,424<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Of 36,000 &s;quare feet each.</NOTE> acres tilled, 14,466 in vines, 94,553 in
meadows, 42,549 in pa&s;turage, and 103,772 in fore&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;ufficient corn is not produced for the interior con|&s;umption,
the deficiency is chiefly &s;upplied from Suabia. In
order to prevent a &s;carcity of this material article, a public
granary is maintained at the expence of government. The
grain is retailed at the common price; but, in &s;ea&s;ons of
&s;carcity, is &s;old con&s;iderably cheaper than it can be purcha&s;ed
at the market. The good effects of this e&s;tabli&s;hment ap|peared
at the dearth in 1771; when, on account of the dear|ne&s;s
of corn, a pound of bread was &s;old for ten pence, the
&s;ame quantity was delivered by government for four pence.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="73">
THE wine made in the canton forms an incon&s;iderable
object of foreign commerce; the greate&s;t part being con|&s;umed
in the country. In 1779 were exported 10,029 ca&s;ks,
each containing 180 bottles; in 1781, 24,568, and in 1782,
11,354.</P>
<P>THE canton contained, in 1784, 174,572 &s;ouls, including
10,500 in the capital. This large population, in proportion
to the &s;ize of the canton, is owing to the trade of Zuric; as
at lea&s;t two thirds of the inhabitants derive their livelihood
by &s;pinning thread and &s;ilk, and making linen for the ma|nufactures
of the town.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign power re&s;ides exclu&s;ively in the burge&s;&s;es
of the town, con&s;i&s;ting of about two thou&s;and. Here I can|not
but remark, that a very narrow &s;pirit of policy reigns
throughout mo&s;t of the &s;tates in Switzerland; as they &s;eldom
confer the burgher&s;hip. This rule, however, in &s;ome of
the republics is le&s;s &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved than in others.
But in Zuric a new citizen has not been admitted during the&s;e
la&s;t hundred and fifty years.</P>
<P>IT is curious to trace the re&s;trictions which have been
gradually laid on granting the burgher&s;hip. On the 26th of
May, 1540, the Sovereign Council i&s;&s;ued a decree, importing,
that who&s;oever was de&s;irous of becoming a citizen, &s;hould
be obliged to produce a certificate of good behaviour, pro|perly
witne&s;&s;ed and &s;igned, and bearing the &s;eal of the ma|gi&s;trates
of the place in which he formerly re&s;ided; and
&s;hould, before he was enrolled among the burghers, pay ten
<PB N="56" REF="74">
florins, near &pound;. 1, if a native of Switzerland, and double that
&s;um if a &s;tranger. An inhabitant of the town or canton was
taxed only at three florins for his admi&s;&s;ion; and all arti&s;ts and
per&s;ons of learning, nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful to the &s;tate, were to
be received gratis. In 1549, it was enacted, that the burgh|er&s;hip
&s;hould be refu&s;ed to all who were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
con&s;iderable riches, or who did not introduce new arts and
trades. This decree was repeatedly confirmed; and, in 1593,
it was added, that a new citizen &s;hould not be entitled to a
&s;hare in the government but on the following conditions. If
an inhabitant of the canton, he mu&s;t have re&s;ided in the
town during ten years; if a native of Switzerland, twenty;
if a foreigner, forty; and that he mu&s;t build or purcha&s;e a
hou&s;e within the walls of Zuric: this la&s;t article was repealed
in 1612. In 1597, the reception of new citizens was delayed
for the fir&s;t time, but only for two years; and in 1610, the
admi&s;&s;ion-money was augmented. In the commencement
of the 17th century, government refu&s;ed to receive into the
Sovereign Council the noble families of Orel, Peffaluzz, and
Muralt; which, in 1555 and 1557, had quitted Italy and
&s;ettled at Zuric: the&s;e families, partly on account of having
embraced the reformed religion, and partly as per&s;ons of ca|pacity
and indu&s;try, had been received into the burgher&s;hip,
but rendered incapable of enjoying a &s;hare in the admini&s;tra|tion
of affairs. This exclu&s;ion, again confirmed in 1592, was
revoked in 1673, in favour only of the family of Muralt,
which exception was obtained by con&s;iderable large&s;&s;es. In
1674, the family of Orel offered to di&s;bur&s;e ten thou&s;and
florins towards the expence of repairing the fortifications, on
condition of being rendered capable of election into the
<PB N="57" REF="75">
Sovereign Council: their petition was then refu&s;ed, but
generou&s;ly granted in 1679, without the &s;malle&s;t equivalent.
Finally, on the 7th of January, 1661, the Council determined
to make no more burghers; which re&s;olution has been in|variably
followed.</P>
<P>THE burghers, be&s;ide the advantage of electing their ma|gi&s;trates,
and of a&s;piring to the admini&s;tration of affairs, enjoy
the &s;ole right of commerce; all &s;trangers, and even &s;ubjects,
being excluded from e&s;tabli&s;hing manufactures in the city,
or in any part of the canton.</P>
<P>THE burghers of Zuric, are divided into thirteen tribes;
one of which is called <HI>Con&s;taffel,</HI> or the tribe of nobles, al|though
at pre&s;ent not ab&s;olutely confined to per&s;ons of that
de&s;cription: it enjoys the privilege of giving eighteen mem|bers
to the Sovereign Council, and &s;ix to the Senate, whereas
each of the other tribes only &s;upply twelve to the former,
and &s;ix to the latter.</P>
<P>THE legi&s;lative authority is ve&s;ted by the burghers, in
the Sovereign Council of two hundred; con&s;i&s;ting, however,
of two hundred and twelve members drawn from the thir|teen
tribes, and compri&s;ing the Senate or Little Council.
This<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Formerly the Senate was &s;eparated into two equal divi&s;ions, which alternately admi|ni&s;tered the office during &s;ix months; and although the&s;e divi&s;ions &s;till continue, yet, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, they have re-united and acted together.</NOTE> Senate, compo&s;ed of fifty members, including the two
burgoma&s;ters, has juri&s;diction in all cau&s;es civil and criminal:
in civil ca&s;es, when the demand is of a certain importance, an
<PB N="58" REF="76">
appeal lies to the Council of two hundred; but in criminal
affairs, their &s;entence is final, and, when once pa&s;&s;ed, there
is no po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining any rever&s;al or mitigation. An
excellent maxim! provided the judges are cautious and cir|cum&s;pect,
and the laws mild: for there is no greater encou|ragement
to the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, than the frequency of
pardons. Such an in&s;titution, however, ought nece&s;&s;arily to
exclude &s;everity of puni&s;hment; and could never be admit|ted
in a &s;tate, where by the letter of the law the &s;ame puni&s;h|ment
is inflicted upon a &s;heep-&s;tealer as upon a parricide.</P>
<P>IT is to be regretted, that in this republic, as in mo&s;t other
&s;tates of Switzerland, there is no preci&s;e code of criminal law.
The Caroline, or code of Charles V. is o&s;ten&s;ibly followed;
but on account of its ob&s;olete u&s;ages and extreme &s;everity,
the &s;entence is ultimately left to the di&s;cretion of the magi|&s;trates.
For notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t perfect integrity, and
upright intentions, yet it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that
party, friend&s;hip, connections, and family, &s;hould not fre|quently
influence the judges and occa&s;ion partial proceedings.
It would perhaps well become the wi&s;dom of this enlightened
and equitable government, to form a penal code, and to a&s;|certain,
with preci&s;ion, the puni&s;hment for each offence.
The example of &s;uch a republic would in time be followed
by the remaining cantons and &s;tates of Switzerland; and
po&s;terity would ble&s;s the name of Zuric for having occa&s;ioned
the introduction of more &s;ettled principles in the criminal
courts of ju&s;tice. Some late deci&s;ions have rendered this
arrangement more obviou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary. Several per&s;ons di&s;|ordered
in their under&s;tandings committed &s;uicide; and,
<PB N="59" REF="77">
although the circum&s;tances of the crime were nearly &s;imilar,
yet the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;entences were pronounced on the&s;e
occa&s;ions: &s;o that the families of tho&s;e, to whom a greater
degree of &s;everity was &s;hewn, were nece&s;&s;arily more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
on account of the mildne&s;s manife&s;ted to the others. Every
judge of delicacy and honour would undoubtedly experience
great &s;atisfaction, to find him&s;elf re&s;trained by preci&s;e laws
from li&s;tening to &s;olicitations from friends and party, and
from being bia&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e feelings, of which it is almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible to be dive&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE power of the Senate, con&s;idered in a collective capa|city,
is very con&s;iderable: it judges finally in all criminal
cau&s;es, has the care of the police, and &s;upplies the principal
magi&s;trates. But, as too great a power of individuals is
dangerous in a republic; the members of this a&s;&s;embly are
liable to be changed: and a revi&s;ion or confirmation is an|nually
made, in &s;ome in&s;tances by the Sovereign Council, in
others by the particular tribes to which the &s;enators belong.
This annual revi&s;ion is a great check to mal-admini&s;tration;
and at the &s;ame time prevents the Senate from gaining &s;o
great an influence, as to be detrimental to the liberties of the
people. A burgher is qualified to vote at twenty; is eligible
into the Sovereign Council at thirty; and into the Senate at
thirty-five. By the&s;e wi&s;e regulations, a man mu&s;t have
formed &s;ome experience in public affairs, before he is capable
of holding an important charge. The revenues of govern|ment,
though not exceeding &pound;. 65,000 <HI>per ann.</HI> are more than
proportionate to the expences; which are regulated with the
&s;tricte&s;t oeconomy. The &s;tate is not only without debts, but
<PB N="60" REF="78">
an annual &s;aving is depo&s;ited in the public trea&s;ury, for a
re&s;ort upon any &s;udden emergency. From this fund go|vernment
&s;upported the whole expence of the war, in 1712,
again&s;t the Catholic cantons, without impo&s;ing any additional
tax.</P>
<P>THE canton of Zuric is divided into di&s;tricts or bailliages,
which are governed by bailifs nominated by the Sovereign
Council. The&s;e bailifs, excepting tho&s;e of Kyburgh and
Groningen, cannot pa&s;s capital &s;entence, or order torture.
They can arre&s;t and interrogate the delinquent, and puni&s;h
&s;mall mi&s;demeanors by whipping, or bani&s;hment from the
bailliage. In capital ca&s;es, they examine, make out the verbal
proce&s;s, and &s;end the felon to Zuric for further trial. On in|quiring
into the &s;tate of criminal juri&s;prudence, I learned
with &s;atisfaction, that the que&s;tion had not been inflicted in
the capital for the&s;e la&s;t nine years, which may be pre&s;umed
to be a prelude to its total abolition; but it is much to be re|gretted,
that whipping, which is a &s;pecies of torture, is not
unfrequently applied, in order to force confe&s;&s;ion, both in
Zuric and in the bailliages; an abu&s;e of ju&s;tice repugnant to
the wi&s;dom of &s;o enlightened a government.</P>
<P>THE city of Zuric &s;tands at the northern extremity of the
lake, and occupies both &s;ides of the rapid and tran&s;parent
Limmat. Its environs are extremely delightful; an amphi|theatre
of hills gradually &s;loping to the borders of the water,
enriched with pa&s;ture and vines; dotted with innumerable
villas, cottages, and hamlets; and backed on the we&s;t by the
Utliberg, a bold and gloomy ridge &s;tretching towards the
<PB N="61" REF="79">
Albis, and that chain of mountains which ri&s;es gradually to
the Alps.</P>
<P>THE town is divided into two parts; the old part, &s;ur|rounded
with the &s;ame antient battlements and towers which
exi&s;ted in the thirteenth century, and the &s;uburbs, which
are &s;trengthened by fortifications in the modern &s;tyle, but
too exten&s;ive. The ditches, in&s;tead of being full of &s;tagnant
water, are mo&s;tly &s;upplied with running &s;treams. The
public walk is plea&s;antly &s;ituated in a lawn, at the junction of
the Limmat and the Sil, an impetuous and turbid torrent,
which de&s;cends from the mountains of Ein&s;idlin: two rows
of lime-trees planted by the &s;ide of the Limmat, and follow|ing
its &s;erpentine direction, afford an agreeable &s;hade in the
heat of &s;ummer. The inhabitants are very indu&s;trious; and
carry on with &s;ucce&s;s &s;everal manufactures: the principal are
tho&s;e of linens and cottons, mu&s;lins, and &s;ilk-handkerchiefs.
The manufacturers do not in general dwell within the walls;
but the materials are mo&s;tly prepared, and the work is com|pleted
in the adjacent di&s;tricts. For this rea&s;on Zuric does
not exhibit the activity and numbers of a great commercial
city. The environs, on the contrary, are &s;o extremely po|pulous,
that perhaps few di&s;tricts in the neighbourhood of a
town, who&s;e population &s;carcely exceeds ten thou&s;and inha|bitants,
contain within &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s &s;o many &s;ouls. The
&s;treets are mo&s;tly narrow; the hou&s;es and public buildings
accord more with plainne&s;s and convenience, than with the
elegance and &s;plendour of a capital.</P>
<P>THE town contained in 1780, 10,559 &s;ouls, in the following
proportions; 2583 male burghers, 3464 female burghers: 860
<PB N="62" REF="80">
foreign clerks, 250 foreigners; 372 male inhabitants, 444 fe|male
inhabitants; 223 men-&s;ervants, 1734 maid-&s;ervants;
and 629 patients in the ho&s;pital. The gradual decrea&s;e of
the population in the town, which ari&s;es from the difficulty
of obtaining the burgher&s;hip, will appear from the following
table.</P>

<P>THE increa&s;e of luxury and opulence will appear from
con&s;idering, that in 1357, the number of men-&s;ervants
amounted to only 84, and of maid-&s;ervants to 263; whereas
in 1780, the former were 223, and the latter 1734; or near a
fifth of the whole population.</P>
<P>THE manners of the inhabitants are in general &s;imple,
and may perhaps in the&s;e times be e&s;teemed antiquated.
Dinner is u&s;ually &s;erved at twelve: in the afternoon the
gentlemen a&s;&s;emble in clubs or &s;mall &s;ocieties, in the town
during winter, and at their re&s;pective villas in &s;ummer.
They frequently &s;moke, and partake of wine, fruit, cakes,
and other refre&s;hments. The women, for the mo&s;t part
employed in their dome&s;tic occupations, or devoted to the
improvement of their children, are not fond of vi&s;iting.
When they go out, they generally a&s;&s;emble in &s;eparate
coteries, to which only a few men, and tho&s;e chiefly the
<PB N="63" REF="81">
neare&s;t relations, are admitted: many of the ladies indeed,
from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their provincial accent, and a diffi|culty
of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in French, &s;eldom make their
appearance when &s;trangers are received. It has more than
once happened to me, that on being &s;hewn into the apart|ment
wherein the ladies were a&s;&s;embled, the ma&s;ter of the
hou&s;e has taken me by the hand, and led me into another
room, where he would have detained me, if I had not re|que&s;ted
to be reconducted to the ladies. This re&s;erve, how|ever,
among the ladies begins greatly to abate, and to give
place to a more &s;ociable intercour&s;e. Such, however, is the
prevalence of national habit, that a few families, which form
a more agreeable mixture of company, are con&s;idered as
differing from the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, and are &s;till known
by the name of the <HI>French Society.</HI></P>
<P>SUMPTUARY laws, as well as tho&s;e again&s;t immorality,
are here well enforced. The former indeed may exi&s;t, and
be carried into execution even among a people much cor|rupted;
for it may be the policy of government to enforce
their ob&s;ervance. But the &s;evere&s;t penalties will not be &s;uf|ficient
to prevent crimes of an immoral tendency, amid&s;t a
general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners: the popular principles can
alone invigorate &s;uch laws, and give to them their full opera|tion.
Secret crimes cannot be prevented; but it is an
evident proof of public virtue, when open breaches of mo|rality
are di&s;countenanced. Among their &s;umptuary laws,
the u&s;e of a carriage in the town is prohibited to all &s;orts of
per&s;ons except &s;trangers: and it is almo&s;t inconceivable that,
in a place &s;o commercial and wealthy, luxury &s;hould &s;o
little prevail.</P>

AT Zuric the original Swi&s;s &s;pirit of independence pre|vails
more than in any of the large towns in this country.
The magi&s;trates, le&s;s influenced by foreign courts, and above
corruption, generally con&s;ult the real advantage of their
canton, and of the Helvetic confederacy. Zuric &s;till pre&s;erves
in the general diet a very con&s;iderable &s;way; which &s;he
derives more from the opinion entertained of her integrity,
than from her power: &s;he is looked up to as one of the
mo&s;t independent and upright of the thirteen cantons.</P>
<P>THE militia of the canton amounted, in 1781, to 25,718
infantry, 1025 artillery, 886 dragoons, and 406 cha&s;&s;eurs; in all
28,235 effective men. There is a military che&s;t at Zuric,
e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1683, and &s;upported by the members of the
great council, who, in&s;tead of giving an expen&s;ive enter|tainment,
are bound on their election or farther promotion
to pay a certain &s;um. From this fund, which has been
con&s;iderably augmented, &pound;. 2000 was taken, in 1770, for the
purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing a magazine of uniforms and arms,
which are either di&s;tributed, or &s;old at a low price to the
poor pea&s;ants who cannot afford to purcha&s;e them at their
full value; each pea&s;ant, according to the military laws of
the canton, being obliged to be provided with arms and an
uniform.</P>
<P>THE ar&s;enal is well &s;upplied with cannon, arms, and am|munition;
and contains a re&s;erve of mu&s;kets for thirty thou|&s;and
men. We &s;aw there, and admired, the two-handed
&s;words and weighty armour of the old Swi&s;s warriors; and
the bow and arrow with which William Tell is &s;aid to have
&s;hot the apple placed on the head of his &s;on. This canton
<PB N="65" REF="83">
has a regiment and &s;ome companies in the &s;ervice of France,
a regiment in that of Holland, and &s;ome companies in the
&s;ervice of the king of Sardinia. The king of France pays
annually for a regiment of fu&s;iliers, con&s;i&s;ting of 1292 men,
&pound;. 20,348. The colonel receives about &pound;. 840 <HI>per ann.</HI> a
captain &pound;. 360: and a common &s;oldier &pound;. 7. The pay of a
regiment of twelve companies, in the Dutch &s;ervice, is
&pound;. 25,377.</P>

<P>IN eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs the Senate is &s;upreme: the canton
is divided into fourteen di&s;tricts, each governed by a
dean, cho&s;en by the &s;ynod, from three candidates propo&s;ed
by the clergy of the dioce&s;e. The &s;ynod, compo&s;ed of the
whole clergy, and &s;everal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors on the part of the Little
Council, meets twice a year. In the la&s;t century it had a
more democratical form, and exerci&s;ed juri&s;diction over its
members: it examined cau&s;es between eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and be|tween
the mini&s;ters and their pari&s;hioners; gave deci&s;ions;
enjoyed the power of impri&s;oning, depo&s;ing, and rein&s;tating
the mini&s;ters; and exerci&s;ed an authority dangerous to the
&s;tate. By degrees their exorbitant prerogatives were an|nulled;
and, in 1700, the clergy of Zuric &s;ucceeded in the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of a more ari&s;tocratical form.</P>
<P>THE principal mini&s;ters and profe&s;&s;ors in the town con|&s;titute,
in conjunction with &s;everal magi&s;trates and other
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors deputed by the civil power, an eccle&s;ia&s;tical and
academical council: to this committee the deans have re|cour&s;e,
in all concerns which &s;eem to exceed their juri&s;dic|tion:
it determines le&s;&s;er affairs, and refers ca&s;es of impor|tance
<PB N="67" REF="85">
to the Senate. The fourteen deans a&s;&s;emble twice a
year in Zuric, and compo&s;e a <HI>pro&s;ynode;</HI> in which they
depute one of their own body to deliver their requi&s;itions,
or <HI>pia de&s;ideria,</HI> fir&s;t to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council, and after|wards
to the General Synod. The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council takes
their reque&s;ts into deliberation, lays them before the Synod,
and if recommended, they are pre&s;ented by the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to
the final deci&s;ion of the Senate.</P>
<P>THE eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices in this canton are extremely
moderate. The be&s;t living may be worth &pound;. 140 <HI>per ann.</HI>
and the wor&s;t about &pound;. 30. The &s;alary of the canonries in
the capital amount to &pound;. 120. But in general, a clergyman
of the town, who has merit, is certain of obtaining a pro|fe&s;&s;or&s;hip,
which adds &pound;. 50 or &pound;. 60 <HI>per ann.</HI> to his other
appointments.</P>
<P>THE charitable e&s;tabli&s;hments at Zuric, are the orphan|hou&s;e,
which is regulated with great attention and care; an
alms-hou&s;e for poor burghers; an ho&s;pital for incurables,
and that for the &s;ick of all nations, which u&s;ually contains
between &s;ix or &s;even hundred patients; and the <HI>Allmo&s;en-Amt,</HI>
or foundation for the poor: this excellent in&s;titution
puts out children as apprentices; and di&s;tributes money,
clothes, and books of devotion to poor per&s;ons, as well in the
town as in different parts of the canton, at the recommen|dation
of the re&s;pective mini&s;ters. In 1697 it di&s;tributed
&pound;. 300; in 1760, &pound;. 5010; in 1770, &pound;. 4796; and in 1778,
&pound;. 5451.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="86">
AMONG the particular in&s;titutions mu&s;t not be omitted the
chirurgical &s;eminary: it is formed by voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions,
and chiefly &s;upported by Dr. Rhan, an eminent phy&s;ician,
who reads lectures gratis, and gives the profits of a publi|cation,
called the <HI>Magazine of Health,</HI> towards maintaining
this &s;eminary, for the in&s;truction of young phy&s;icians and
&s;urgeons, de&s;tined to &s;ettle in the country.</P>
<P>AT Zuric public education is a &s;tate concern, and under
the immediate protection of government. The office of a
profe&s;&s;or gives rank and e&s;timation, and is often held by a
member of the Senate and of the Great Council. The prin|cipal
literary e&s;tabli&s;hments for the in&s;truction of youth are,
the Caroline College for &s;tudents in divinity; <HI>Collegium
Humanitatis,</HI> or the college for polite literature; and the
&s;chool of arts: the fir&s;t has twelve profe&s;&s;ors, the &s;econd
two, and the la&s;t &s;even. The learned languages, divinity,
natural hi&s;tory, mathematics, and in &s;hort every &s;pecies of
polite learning, as well as ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience, is taught at a &s;mall
expence in the&s;e re&s;pective &s;eminaries.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the unremitted attention which, &s;ince
the reformation, government has paid to the education of
youth, many eminent per&s;ons have flouri&s;hed in all branches
of literature; and there is no town in Switzerland, where
letters are more encouraged, or where they have been cul|tivated
with greater &s;ucce&s;s. A learned profe&s;&s;or of Zuric
has, in a very intere&s;ting publication, di&s;played the impor|tant
&s;ervices which erudition and &s;cience have derived from
the labours of his countrymen. In the&s;e biographical
<PB N="69" REF="87">
memoirs appear, among many others, the names of Zuingle
and Bullinger, Conrad Ge&s;ner, Hottinger, Simler, Spon,
Scheutzer, Heydegger, Breitinger, Bodmer, Hertzel, and
Solomon Ge&s;ner.</P>
<P>OF all the luminaries which Zuric, fertile in great ge|niu&s;es,
has ever produced, Conrad Ge&s;ner perhaps occupies
the fir&s;t place. He was born at Zuric in 1516, and died in
1564, in the 48th year of his age. Tho&s;e who are con|ver&s;ant
with the works of this great &s;cholar and naturali&s;t,
cannot repre&s;s their wonder and admiration at the amplitude
of his knowledge in every &s;pecies of erudition, and the
variety of his di&s;coveries in natural hi&s;tory, which was his
peculiar delight. Their wonder and admiration is &s;till further
augmented, when they con&s;ider the gro&s;s ignorance of the
age which he helped to enlighten, and the &s;canty &s;uccours
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to aid him in thus extending the bounds of
knowledge; that he compo&s;ed his works, and made tho&s;e
di&s;coveries which would have done honour to the mo&s;t en|lightened
period, under the complicated evils of poverty,
&s;ickne&s;s, and dome&s;tic unea&s;ine&s;s. A detail of his life and
writings, by an author capable of appreciating his multi|farious
knowledge, would be a ju&s;t tribute to the merits of
this prodigy of learning (<HI>Mon&s;trum Eruditionis</HI>) as he is
emphatically &s;tiled by Boerhaave.</P>
<P>BODMER, born in 1698, was alive in 1776, when I fir&s;t
vi&s;ited Switzerland; but I was at that time ignorant of the
German language, and unacquainted with his great merits in
reforming the ta&s;te of his contemporaries, and familiarizing
<PB N="70" REF="88">
them to the &s;ublime beauties of Homer and Milton. He
died in 1783. I now regret that I did not cultivate the ac|quaintance
of a man, whom the unanimous voice of his con|temporaries
de&s;ervedly &s;tyles the Father of German litera|ture;
who&s;e ju&s;t critici&s;ms and correct judgment animated
the poetical genius of Clop&s;tock, Haller, and Ge&s;ner.</P>
<P>I DID not, however, omit waiting upon Solomon Ge&s;ner,
the celebrated author of the Death of Abel, and of &s;everal
idyls, ju&s;tly e&s;teemed for their delicate and elegant &s;implicity.
They abound with tho&s;e nice touches of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility,
which di&s;cover a mind warmed with the fine&s;t &s;entiments;
and love is repre&s;ented in the cha&s;te&s;t colouring of innocence,
virtue, and benevolence. Nor has he confined his &s;ubjects
merely to the pa&s;&s;ion of love: paternal affection, and filial
reverence; gratitude, humanity, in &s;hort every moral duty
is exhibited and inculcated in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and affecting
manner. He has for &s;ome time renounced poetry in order
to a&s;&s;ume the pencil; and painting is at pre&s;ent his favourite
amu&s;ement. A treati&s;e which he has publi&s;hed on land&s;capes,
di&s;covers the elegance of his ta&s;te, and the ver&s;atility of his
genius; while his compo&s;itions in both kinds prove the
re&s;emblance of the two arts; and that the conceptions of the
poet and of the painter are congenial. His drawings in
black and white are preferable to his paintings; for, although
the ideas in both are equally beautiful or &s;ublime, the co|louring
is inferior to the de&s;ign. He has publi&s;hed a hand|&s;ome
edition of his writings in quarto, in which every part
of the work is carried on by him&s;elf: he prints them at his
own pre&s;s; and is at once both the drawer and engraver of
<PB N="71" REF="89">
plates. It is to be lamented that he has renounced poetry;
for, while ordinary writers &s;pring up in great plenty; authors
of real genius are rare and uncommon. His drawings are
&s;een only by a few: but his writings are di&s;per&s;ed abroad,
tran&s;lated into every language, and will be admired by future
ages, as long as there remains a reli&s;h for true pa&s;toral &s;im|plicity,
or ta&s;te for original compo&s;ition. He is plain in his
manners; open, affable, and obliging in his addre&s;s; and of
&s;ingular mode&s;ty. Ge&s;ner died of an apoplexy, March 2d,
1788.</P>
<P>I CALLED al&s;o on Mr. Lavater, a clergyman of Zuric,
and celebrated phy&s;iognomi&s;t, who has publi&s;hed four
large volumes in quarto on that fanciful &s;ubject. That
particular pa&s;&s;ions have a certain effect upon particular
features, is evident to the mo&s;t common ob&s;erver; and it
may be conceived, that an habitual indulgence of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions
may po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome ca&s;es, impre&s;s a di&s;tingui&s;hing
mark on the countenance: but that a certain ca&s;t of features
con&s;tantly denotes certain pa&s;&s;ions; and that by contem|plating
the countenance, we can infallibly di&s;cover al&s;o the
mental qualities, is an hypothe&s;is liable to &s;o many excep|tions,
as renders it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h a general and
uniform &s;y&s;tem. Neverthele&s;s Mr. Lavater, like a true en|thu&s;ia&s;t,
carries his theory much farther: for he not only
pretends to di&s;cover the characters and pa&s;&s;ions by the
features, by the complexion, by the form of the head, and
by the motion of the arms; but he al&s;o draws &s;ome in|ferences
of the &s;ame kind even from the hand-writing.
Indeed his &s;y&s;tem is founded upon &s;uch univer&s;al principles,
<PB N="72" REF="90">
that he applies the &s;ame rules to all animated nature, extend|ing
them not only to brutes, but even to in&s;ects. That the
temper of a hor&s;e may be di&s;covered by his countenance,
will not perhaps &s;trike you as ab&s;urd: but did you ever hear
before, that any quality could be inferred from the phy&s;iog|nomy
of a bee, an ant, or a cock-chafer? While I give my
opinion thus freely concerning Mr. Lavater's notions, you will
readily perceive that I am not one of tho&s;e who are initiat|ed
into the my&s;teries of his art. Mr. Lavater has not merely
confined him&s;elf to phy&s;iognomy. He has compo&s;ed &s;acred
hymns and national &s;ongs, which are much e&s;teemed for
their &s;implicity. He has al&s;o given to the public numerous
works on &s;acred &s;ubjects. I am concerned to add, that the
ingenious author extends to religion the &s;ame enthu|&s;ia&s;m
which he has employed in his re&s;earches on phy&s;iog|nomy,
and in his poetical compo&s;itions: the warmth of his
imagination hurries him on to adopt whatever is mo&s;t fanci|ful
and extraordinary; to out&s;tep the limits of &s;ober rea&s;on;
to be an advocate for the efficacy of ab&s;olute faith; for
inward illuminations; for &s;upernatural vi&s;ions; and for the
miraculous effects of what is called <HI>animal magneti&s;m</HI> in the
cure of di&s;orders. The in&s;inuating addre&s;s of Mr. Lavater,
the vivacity of his conver&s;ation, the amenity of his manners,
together with the &s;ingularity and animation of his &s;tyle, have
contributed more to diffu&s;e his &s;y&s;tem and principles, than
&s;ound arguments or deep learning, which are not to be
&s;ound in his lively but de&s;ultory compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>AMONG the eminent men of Zuric, mu&s;t not be omitted
Dr. Hirtzel, a learned phy&s;ician, who is de&s;ervedly &s;tiled the
<PB N="73" REF="91">
Swi&s;s Plutarch, and has, among various publications, more
particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the <HI>Socrate Ru&s;tique,</HI>
and by the lives of Sultzer and Heydegger.</P>
<P>LEONHARD Mei&s;ter, profe&s;&s;or of hi&s;tory and morality in
the School of Arts, de&s;erves to be mentioned among the
learned men of Zuric. The ver&s;atility of his talents will be
collected from a bare catalogue of his principal works: which
are written in the German tongue.&mdash;On Fanatici&s;m; the
Hi&s;tory of the German Language and Literature; Lives of
the celebrated men of Zuric; Swi&s;s Biography; the mo&s;t
memorable Events of the Helvetic Hi&s;tory, in Chronolo|gical
Order; In&s;tances of Intolerance and Fanatici&s;m in
Switzerland; Public Law of Switzerland; Hi&s;tory of the
Town and Canton of Zuric; Panegyric on Bodmer; Excur|&s;ions
through various Parts of Switzerland; Character of the
German Poets, in Chronological Order, with their Portraits;
Abridgment of Antient Hi&s;tory, particularly of the Greeks,
with an Introduction on the Fine Arts and Polite Literature.
In all his writings the judicious author has di&s;played great
zeal for the promotion of learning, correctne&s;s of ta&s;te, li|berality
of &s;entiment, and much hi&s;torical and biographical
knowledge. But in his ob&s;ervations on fanatici&s;m and in|tolerance,
he has treated tho&s;e &s;ubjects in a new light: he
has illu&s;trated their dreadful effects on government and civil
&s;ociety by hi&s;torical events, and in a political view; he has
appealed from theory to experience, and exemplified que&s;|tionable
arguments by unan&s;werable facts. In this in&s;tance
he has been no le&s;s &s;ingularly u&s;eful in combating per&s;e|cution,
than in repre&s;&s;ing that &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m that pre|vailed
<PB N="74" REF="92">
among many of his countrymen, and which is diffu&s;ed
by men of lively abilities and popular manners.</P>
<P>THE curio&s;ity of the naturali&s;t will be amply gratified by
a view of the library and cabinet of Mr. John Ge&s;ner, pro|fe&s;&s;or
of phy&s;ics, and canon of the cathedral, who inherits
the zeal for natural hi&s;tory which characteri&s;ed his great an|ce&s;tor
Conrad Ge&s;ner. His proficiency in the &s;tudy of nature,
and particularly his accurate &s;kill in botany, has been
abundantly te&s;tified by the repeated acknowledgments of
Haller, whom he accompanied in his herbori&s;ing excur&s;ions
through the mountains of Switzerland, and who confe&s;&s;es
him&s;elf indebted to Mr. Ge&s;ner for various ob&s;ervations and
important di&s;coveries. Mr. Ge&s;ner's cabinet is extremely
rich in fo&s;&s;ils, and remarkable for the drawings of the prin|cipal
&s;pecimens in his mu&s;eum; and for numerous repre|&s;entations
of in&s;ects admirably painted by Schellenberg.
But one of the mo&s;t curious parts of his collection, is a great
botanical work, which Haller calls <HI>va&s;ti&s;&s;imum et pulcherri|mum
opus;</HI> and which, it is much to be regretted, he has
hitherto withheld from the public. He has exhibited, in
eighty tables, a thou&s;and generical characters of plants, ac|cording
to the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem, together with many of the
&s;pecific characters. The&s;e tables, intended to illu&s;trate a
general hi&s;tory of plants, which, as appears by his own
letters to Haller, the author meditated, were drawn and en|graved
by Gei&s;ler, the &s;ame per&s;on who di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf
by painting the &s;hells of Regenfu&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Coxe's Travels into Poland, &amp;c. Book viii. chap. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="93">
AMIDST the various occupations of Ge&s;ner, botany, to
which he had an early and &s;trong attachment, has engaged a
great &s;hare of his attention; be&s;ides two or three early pro|ductions
in this line, he began, in the year 1759, to publi&s;h
a work which he has extended to eight publications, in the
quarto form. The fir&s;t &s;even parts bear the title of <HI>Phy|tographia
Sacra Generalis;</HI> the remaining that of <HI>Phyto|graphia
Sacra Specialis.</HI> In this work the author treats on
philo&s;ophy, of vegetation in general, and on the circulation
of the &s;ap through the particular parts of plants; on the
Linnaean &s;y&s;tem again&s;t the objections of Al&s;ton; on the u&s;es
of plants as food to man, and gives a detail of upwards of a
hundred edible kinds, with a compendious account of the
&s;pecific properties of each; on the medicinal u&s;es of plants;
on the various oeconomical u&s;es of vegetables, illu&s;trating in
a particular manner, among many others, tho&s;e of the Palm|tree,
Flax, and Aloes. In the latter volumes of this work,
the author treats on other advantages derived to mankind
from the vegetable world. He &s;peaks, for in&s;tance, on the
nature and con&s;tituent parts of turf and peat, and enume|rates
the &s;pecies of bog and fen plants which enter into the
compo&s;ition of each; on the kinds of &s;hrubs proper for
hedges; on timber for building, and particularly &s;uch as
were u&s;ed for tho&s;e purpo&s;es by the ancients. In the fir&s;t
part, which is all that is hitherto publi&s;hed, of what he
names <HI>Phytographia Sacra Specialis,</HI> he has given an account
of tho&s;e authors who have written on the plants of the holy
&s;criptures, and enters upon the hi&s;tory of each.</P>
<P>THE Society of Phy&s;ics owes its origin to Me&s;&s;rs. Hey|degger,
Schultetz, and John Ge&s;ner, who fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled
<PB N="76" REF="94">
in 1745, and admitted others, in order to attend a cour&s;e of
lectures on natural hi&s;tory. This cour&s;e was read by Mr.
John Ge&s;ner, profe&s;&s;or of phy&s;ics, who &s;o greatly excited the
attention, and animated the zeal of his audience, that in a
&s;hort &s;pace of time the members were increa&s;ed to &s;eventy.
The fir&s;t regular meeting was held in 1745, in a private
hou&s;e; and in a few years they de&s;erved and received the
protection of government, which granted the profits of a
lottery towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a fund. There are now about
a hundred and twelve members: each pays on his admittance
eight florins, or about &s;eventeen &s;hillings, and the &s;ame &s;um
annually. Since 1757, a &s;uite of apartments, in a hou&s;e be|longing
to one of the tribes, has been a&s;&s;igned for holding
their a&s;&s;emblies, and for containing their library and ap|paratus.
The &s;ociety is divided into five departments.
1. Phy&s;ics. 2. Mathematics. 3. Natural hi&s;tory. 4. Me|dicine.
5. Application of phy&s;ics to arts and trades. But
the grand and principal object of this &s;ociety, is the encou|ragement
and improvement of practical agriculture. For
this purpo&s;e the members corre&s;pond with the land-holders
in different parts of the canton; vi&s;it various di&s;tricts in ro|tation;
&s;ummon to Zuric &s;ome of the be&s;t informed farmers;
acquaint them&s;elves with the &s;tate of hu&s;bandry; give
them in&s;tructions; offer prizes for improvements in culti|vation;
furni&s;h &s;mall &s;ums of money to the poorer pea&s;ants:
and communicate to the public the re&s;ult of their inquiries
and ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>THE public library at Zuric contains about 25,000 vo|lumes,
and a few curious manu&s;cripts. Among the manu|&s;cripts,
the following principally attracted my attention.
<PB N="77" REF="95">
1. The original manu&s;cript of Quintilian, found in the li|brary
of St. Gallen, and from which the fir&s;t edition of that
great rhetorician was printed. 2. The p&s;alms in the Greek
tongue, written on parchment dyed of a violet colour. The
letters are &s;ilver, excepting the initials, which are in golden
characters, and the marginal references, which are red. It
is &s;imilar to the celebrated <HI>Codex Argenteus</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Travels into Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, &amp;c. Book vii. chap. vi.</NOTE> in the library
of Up&s;ala. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have once formed part of the
<HI>Codex Vaticanus,</HI> pre&s;erved in the Vatican library at Rome:
as both of the&s;e manu&s;cripts are &s;imilar, and the Roman
volume is deficient in the p&s;alms. The learned Breitinger
has publi&s;hed a di&s;&s;ertation on this codex<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Antiqui&s;&s;imo Turicen&s;is Bibliothecae Graeco P&s;almorum Libro Turici. 1748.</NOTE>. 3. Several ma|nu&s;cripts
of Zuingle, which prove the indefatigable indu&s;try
of that celebrated reformer. Among the&s;e I particularly
noticed his Latin Commentary on Gene&s;is and I&s;aiah, and a
copy of St. Paul's Epi&s;tles from the Greek Te&s;tament pub|li&s;hed
by Era&s;mus. At the end is written an in&s;cription in
the Greek tongue, &s;ignifying, &startq;Copied by Ulric Zuingle,
1415.&endq; It was pre&s;ented to the public library by Ann Zuingle,
the la&s;t &s;urvivor of his illu&s;trious racc. 4. Three Latin
letters from Lady Jane Grey to Bullinger, in 1551, 1552, and
1553. The&s;e letters, written with her own hand, breathe a
&s;pirit of the mo&s;t unaffected piety, and prove the extraor|nary
progre&s;s which this unfortunate and accompli&s;hed
prince&s;s, though only in the &s;ixteenth year of her age, had
made in various branches of literature. The Greek and
Hebrew quotations &s;hew that &s;he was well acquainted with
<PB N="78" REF="96">
tho&s;e languages. The&s;e letters, though given in &s;everal
publications, yet are not printed with that accuracy, which
the relics of &s;uch a per&s;onage de&s;erve. This library is rich
in the be&s;t editions of the cla&s;&s;ics; and particularly in the
early impre&s;&s;ions of the 15th century.</P>
<P>THE library of the cathedral belonging to the Caroline
College contains &s;everal manu&s;cripts of the reformers, Bul|linger,
Pelican, Bibliander, and Leon Juda; particularly the
tran&s;lation of the Talmud by Pelican and Bibliander, which
has never been printed; al&s;o &s;ixty volumes of letters from Zuin|gle
and the early reformers, with a complete index. This col|lection,
&s;o intere&s;ting to eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, was formed by
Henry Hottinger<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He was born in 1620; and was drowned in the Limmat, 1667.</NOTE>, the learned author of the Hi&s;tory of the
Reformation, renowned for his exten&s;ive erudition, and par|ticularly
for his profound &s;kill in oriental literature. The
librarian pointed out an antient manu&s;cript of the Latin
Vulgate, called <HI>Codex Carolinus,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a
pre&s;ent from Charlemain; but without foundation, for it is
certainly of much later date, probably of the eleventh cen|tury.
Among the rare books is the Latin Bible, tran&s;lated
by Pelican, Bibliander, and Leon Juda, printed at Zuric
in 1545.</P>
<P>THE lover of literary and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory will not fail
to vi&s;it the Reverend Mr. Simler's ample collection of letters
which pa&s;&s;ed between Zuingle and the other reformers of
Zuric, and their corre&s;pondents in different parts of Europe.
<PB N="79" REF="97">
The learned profe&s;&s;or propo&s;ed to have printed by &s;ub&s;crip|tion,
in two volumes in folio, the letters of the Engli&s;h re|formers,
&s;everal of which Burnet has publi&s;hed in his Hi&s;tory
of the Reformation, but with many errors. Not finding,
however, &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;cribers for &s;o expen&s;ive a publication,
he was obliged to relinqui&s;h his plan, to the regret of all
lovers of biography.</P>
<P>THE library of Mr. de Heydegger, &s;enator of Zuric, de|&s;erves
the notice of the learned traveller. The ingenious
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or inherited from his father only 3000 volumes, which
he has extended to 15,000. His principal aim is directed to
tho&s;e books that were unknown to Maittaire, which might
a&s;&s;i&s;t in correcting his typographical annals, and in forming
an accurate and connected hi&s;tory of printing. In this col|lection
are found many rare and elegant impre&s;&s;ions by the
Aldu&s;es, Juntas, Giolitos, Torzentino, Stephens, Elzivers,
Comino, Ton&s;on, Wet&s;tein, Ba&s;kerville, Bodoni, Barbot, and
Didot. It is particularly rich in the earlie&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, of
which there are no le&s;s than &s;even hundred that were printed
in the fifteenth century. Among many rare books, I noted
down the following: Ciceronis Officia. Fu&s;t et Sheiffer
1465. pet. in folio.&mdash;Jo. Sanuen&s;is Catholicon, folio. Aug.
Vindel. Gunther, Zeiner et Reutlingen, 1469.&mdash;Fir&s;t edition

EXCURSION TO REGENSBERG, AND TO
THE SUMMIT OF THE LAGERBERG.</HEAD>
<P>DURING my fir&s;t tour through Switzerland, I pa&s;&s;ed
too &s;hort a time at Zuric to have an opportunity of
vi&s;iting its delightful environs, which, for the mild beauties
of nature, the numerous population, and the well-being of
the pea&s;antry, is &s;carcely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any &s;pot on the globe.
Having, on &s;ub&s;equent occa&s;ions, re&s;ided longer at Zuric, I
did not omit making &s;everal excur&s;ions into various parts of
the canton; an account of which will form the &s;ubject of
the pre&s;ent letter.</P>
<P>THE weather clearing up after &s;everal continued and
heavy rains, on the 24th of June, 1785, I accompanied Mr.
de Bon&s;tet of Berne, Profe&s;&s;or Mei&s;ter, and &s;ome other gen|tlemen
of Zuric, in a delightful tour round the lake. We
had no need of guides, as the country was well known to my
companions; and we had no incumbrance of baggage.
Having made an early dinner, according to the cu&s;tom of the
place, we departed at mid-day; and walked about three miles,
through vineyards and corn-fields, to Ku&s;&s;nach, a &s;mall vil|lage
<PB N="82" REF="100">
on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake. Here we paid a vi&s;it to a
gentleman, and were &s;erved with tea, &s;lices of bread and
butter, and cherries.</P>
<P>IN 1778, Ku&s;&s;nach was con&s;iderably damaged by the ri&s;e
of a &s;mall torrent, which poured down from the mountains,
carried away twenty-five hou&s;es, and de&s;troyed about &s;ixty
per&s;ons. This torrent, now only a little rill, &s;welled to
&s;uch a degree, as to ri&s;e at lea&s;t thirty feet above its u&s;ual
level: an increa&s;e owing to the &s;udden melting of the &s;now
on the neighbouring heights. Every a&s;&s;i&s;tance was in&s;tantly
afforded to the wretched inhabitants, and a collection of
&pound;. 3000 was rai&s;ed in one Sunday at the different churches of
Zuric: an a&s;toni&s;hing collection for a town which does not
contain 11,000 &s;ouls.</P>
<P>I AM indebted to Profe&s;&s;or Mei&s;ter for the following ob|&s;ervations
on the population, indu&s;try, and productions of
Ku&s;&s;nach, and the neighbouring villages. Ku&s;&s;nach contains
about 1700 &s;ouls, and the neighbouring villages are no le&s;s
peopled: this a&s;toni&s;hing population in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s is
occa&s;ioned by the trade of the capital, which employs &s;o many
hands. The proportion between the produce of the &s;oil and
the profits derived from working for the manufactures, may
be e&s;timated from the following calculation: Five pari&s;hes
and two villages, &s;ituated near the lakes of Zuric and Greiffen,
contain 8498 &s;ouls; and comprehend only 6050 acres<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The acre u&s;ed in this letter contains from 32,600 to 36,000 &s;quare feet.</NOTE> of
arable land, 698 of vines, and 3407 of pa&s;ture, or &s;carcely an
<PB N="83" REF="101">
acre and a quarter for each per&s;on. Their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is
principally &s;upplied by 2016 looms, by means of which they
prepare &s;ilk and cotton for the merchants of Zuric. In the&s;e
parts an acre is &s;old for &pound;. 100 or &pound;. 120; whereas the &s;ame
quantity in the interior part of the canton is worth only &pound;. 20
or &pound;. 30.</P>
<P>IN &s;ixteen pari&s;hes, &s;ituated on the borders of the lake,
the number of inhabitants, in 1784, were 32,581. There
were 271 marriages, 1135 births. The proportion of the
marriages to the births, as 1000 to 4188; of the births to
the deaths, as 1000 to 882; of the births to the living, as
1000 to 18,705; of the deaths to the living, as 2000 to 32,515;
of the males to the females, as 1000 to 1097.</P>
<P>HAVING repo&s;ed our&s;elves about an hour at Ku&s;&s;nach,
we continued our walk through vineyards and corn-fields,
&s;ometimes on the &s;loping banks of the lake, &s;ometimes on a
&s;mall foot-path formed on terraces upon a level with the
water; or along narrow roads that re&s;emble gravel-walks
winding through plea&s;ure-grounds and parks in England.
We enjoyed, during great part of the way, the mo&s;t agreeable
&s;hade from large beech and oak, walnut and other fruit|trees,
that overhang like weeping willows; many of which are
planted almo&s;t horizontally, either &s;tretching from the &s;ides of
the hill, or from the very edge of the water, their boughs
dipping into the lake: the &s;cattered cottages, the numerous
villages, the picture&s;que villas placed on the banks of the
lake, and &s;everal neat churches, added to the beauty of the
ever-changing &s;cenery.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="102">
HAVING walked about three miles further, we &s;topped at
a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e in Meile, who regaled us with our u&s;ual
fare, milk and cherries, but would receive no recompen&s;e.
Here we embarked and cro&s;&s;ed the lake, enjoying a mo&s;t
agreeable view of each border &s;tudded with villas, churches,
and villages, many of which look like large towns, as they
were half concealed by the intervening trees. As we pa&s;&s;ed
near a bold promontory, richly covered with wood, we ob|&s;erved
the &s;un, which was hid under a cloud, gilding the
di&s;tant town of Rapper&s;chwyl, the hills towards Zuric
&s;ilvered by a milder ray, and the gloomy but &s;ublime moun|tains
of Glarus boldy ri&s;ing to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>WE landed at Wedden&s;chweil, which is agreeably &s;ituated
on the we&s;t &s;ide of the lake. It is the capital of a bailliage,
that &s;tretches to the limits of the cantons of Zug and
Schweitz, and was formerly an independent lord&s;hip. In
1287 it was &s;old by Rhodolph of Wedden&s;ch weil to the knights
of Jeru&s;alem; and became a commandery until 1459, when
Zuric purcha&s;ed it from the ma&s;ter of that order for 20,000
florins. The inhabitants having revolted in 1466, and being
compelled to &s;ubmit, were deprived of &s;everal privileges,
and particularly the criminal juri&s;diction, which was trans|ferred
to the &s;enate of Zuric. Notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of
the&s;e immunities, the mildne&s;s of government is &s;ufficiently
manife&s;ted, by the con&s;iderable increa&s;e of the population
within this la&s;t century. The number of &s;ouls, which in
1678 con&s;i&s;ted of only 4867, amounted in 1782 to 8188.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="103">
NEAR Wedden&s;chweil I ob&s;erved a beautiful meadow,
prettily &s;kirted with wood, and fertilized by a lively &s;tream,
which tempted me to quit the road. I had &s;carcely proceeded
fifty paces, before I &s;aw a &s;ilver rill gu&s;hing from the crevice
of a rock &s;prinkled with wood. As we were contemplating
this plea&s;ing land&s;cape, we heard the noi&s;e of falling waters,
and caught a glimp&s;e of a torrent tumbling from an elevated
rock, gli&s;tening through the dark foliage, and richly illumi|nated
by the rays of the &s;un, which was concealed from our
view. Having penetrated by the &s;ide of the torrent, we &s;aw
it bur&s;ting from the height, amid &s;urrounding trees, fall
about &s;ix feet upon a ridge, and then roll fifty feet in mid
air, without touching the &s;ides of the precipice. The effect
was peculiarly &s;triking. Nor could we &s;ufficiently admire
the amphitheatre of rock, the beeches &s;u&s;pended on its top
and &s;ides, the beams of the &s;un darting on the falling waters,
and the noi&s;e of the torrent contra&s;ting with the mild and
tranquil beauties of the lake we had ju&s;t quitted.</P>
<P>OUR walk to Richli&s;wick, where we pa&s;&s;ed the night, was
no le&s;s agreeable than that on the other &s;ide of the lake.
The road ran &s;ometimes through meadows, at a little di&s;tance
from the lake, &s;ometimes clo&s;e to the water, under the &s;hade
of trees planted ca&s;ually by the hand of nature, in the mo&s;t
capricious &s;hapes: we &s;carcely advanced a hundred &s;teps
without pa&s;&s;ing a neat cottage, and meeting with pea&s;ants,
who &s;aluted us as we went along. Every &s;pot of ground is
cultivated in the highe&s;t perfection. At Richli&s;wick, which
like Wedden&s;chweil contains many good hou&s;es of &s;tone,
plai&s;tered and white-wa&s;hed, ornamented with green window|&s;hutters,
and Venetian blinds, we found an inn with com|fortable
<PB N="86" REF="104">
accommodations. This place is the pa&s;&s;age of much
merchandize; and is greatly re&s;orted to by the pilgrims, in
their way to Ein&s;idlin.</P>
<P>EARLY the next morning we embarked, and &s;ailed to the
I&s;le of Ufnau. The weather was uncommonly fine, the lake
was quite &s;till, the reflection of the white hou&s;es quivered
on the &s;urface of the water; and the hollows of the di&s;tant
mountains &s;eemed to be filled with a tran&s;parent vapour,
which induced me to cry out, in the language of poetry,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Plea&s;ant the &s;un,</L>
<L>When fir&s;t on this delightful land he &s;preads</L>
<L>His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</L>
<L>Gli&s;t'ring with dew<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</NOTE>.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>ABOUT a mile from Richli&s;wick is a &s;ingle hou&s;e &s;tanding
on a gentle acclivity, the walls of which divide the canton
of Zuric from that of Schweitz, and at the &s;ame time &s;et
in&s;tant bounds to that indu&s;try and population which had
hitherto attracted our wonder and delight.</P>
<P>IN about two hours we landed at Ufnau, a plea&s;ant i&s;land,
about an Engli&s;h mile in circumference, belonging to the
abbey of Ein&s;idlin. It has only a &s;ingle hou&s;e, inhabited by
a pea&s;ant's family, two barns, a kind of tower or &s;ummer|hou&s;e,
&s;eated on the highe&s;t point, a chapel which is never
u&s;ed, and a church in which ma&s;s is &s;aid only twice in the
year. Within is the tomb of St. Alderic, who built an her|mitage
<PB N="87" REF="105">
on the i&s;land, to which he retired. He died in 1473,
and mu&s;t have been highly revered for his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity;
as a Latin in&s;cription informs us, that &startq;he was fed with
bread from heaven, and walked upon the &s;urface of the
waters.&endq; This i&s;land is &s;ometimes called Hutten's i&s;land,
in memory of that extraordinary per&s;on, who retired and
died in this ob&s;cure &s;pot.</P>
<P>HUTTEN, de&s;cended from an illu&s;trious family, was born
at Seckenberg in Franconia, and receiving an education
&s;uitable to his birth, pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies with that im|petuous
zeal which was the leading mark of his character.
He pa&s;&s;ed a life of almo&s;t unparalleled vici&s;&s;itude; &s;ometimes
in the camp, &s;ignalized for per&s;onal courage; &s;ometimes in
univer&s;ities, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by various pub|lications;
&s;ometimes in courts, received with re&s;pect, or
driven away for in&s;olence; and &s;ometimes wandering over
different parts of Europe in extreme indigence. Having, at
an early period of his life, embraced the opinions of Luther,
he drew both his pen and his &s;word in defence of the new
doctrines; was &s;o intemperate in his ardour, that he was
frequently impri&s;oned; and alarmed even the daring &s;pirit
of Luther by his repeated outrages. Having rendered him|&s;elf
an object of terror to both Lutherans and Catholics, his
overbearing temper in vain &s;ought an a&s;ylum, until he found
it in this &s;eque&s;tered i&s;land. He expired in 1523, in the 36th
year of his age: a man as remarkable for his genius and
learning, as for his turbulence and pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>THE i&s;land is agreeably broken into hill and dale; is ex|tremely
fertile in pa&s;ture; produces hemp, flax, a few vines,
<PB N="88" REF="106">
and a &s;mall tufted wood, which overhangs the edge of the
water. It is the only i&s;land in the lake of Zuric, except an
uninhabited rock, which yields a &s;mall quantity of hay.</P>
<P>HAVING reimbarked, we &s;oon landed at Rapper&s;chwyl,
and continued a&s;cending amid hanging enclo&s;ures of pa&s;ture
and corn, commanding a fine view of the lake, hills, moun|tains,
and alps. Having pa&s;&s;ed the little territory belonging
to Rapper&s;chwyl, we came into the canton of Zuric. On
entering a neat cottage, to inquire the road, we &s;aw a pea&s;ant
teaching about thirty children to read and write. On ex|pre&s;&s;ing
my &s;urprize and &s;atisfaction, I was informed that
each village has a pea&s;ant &s;choolma&s;ter, either entirely or
partly paid by government; and that in this canton there is
&s;carcely a child who is not in&s;tructed in reading and writing.
A little further we entered another cottage, where the mi&s;|tre&s;s
of the hou&s;e offered us milk and cherries, and placed
upon the table nine or ten large &s;ilver &s;poons.</P>
<P>WE continued our walk through an enclo&s;ed, hilly, and
well-wooded country, and arrived about mid-day at Grunen|gen,
a &s;mall burgh, capital of the bailliage. After dinner we
paid a vi&s;it to the bailif, who re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle, which
&s;tands on an elevated rock, overlooking an exten&s;ive pro|&s;pect;
towards the &s;outh wild and romantic, towards the
we&s;t rich and well cultivated, watered by a lively &s;tream
which flows from the lake of Pfe&s;&s;ikon. The bailif po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
con&s;iderable authority. He judges civil and criminal
affairs, in the pre&s;ence of certain jurymen and the under|bailif;
but can pa&s;s &s;entence without their concurrence, as
neither of them enjoys a vote. He can puni&s;h all crimes
<PB N="89" REF="107">
which are not capital; can order whipping, or even the torture
to be inflicted, when the criminal is convicted, and will not
confe&s;s: I was greatly &s;hocked to find that this horrid expe|dient
had been lately practi&s;ed. Even in capital ca&s;es he can
condemn to death, provided he &s;ummons eighty jurymen
from the different di&s;tricts to be pre&s;ent at the trial; but as
this cu&s;tom is attended with much expence, he u&s;ually
remits the culprit to Zuric. In civil proceedings an appeal
lies from his deci&s;ion to the &s;enate of Zuric. If the bailif
abu&s;es his power, the &s;enate readily li&s;tens to the complaints
of the oppre&s;&s;ed inhabitants, and would not fail to puni&s;h
the unju&s;t judge. An in&s;tance of this impartiality occurred
in 1754, when the bailif being proved guilty of extortions,
though he was &s;on-in-law to the burgoma&s;ter, was fined and
bani&s;hed from Switzerland. I learned this fact, on ob&s;erving
a vacant place in the &s;eries of coats of arms belonging to the
&s;everal bailifs, which are painted in the hall of the ca&s;tle;
the arms of the extortioner, which once filled this vacant
place, had been era&s;ed by order of government.</P>
<P>FROM Grunengen we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e through lanes,
fields, and enclo&s;ures, along a mo&s;t delightful country,
abounding in vines, corn, pa&s;ture, and wood. As the &s;etting
&s;un gradually de&s;cended below the horizon, we frequently
looked back upon the di&s;tant alps, who&s;e lower parts were
du&s;ky and gloomy; and who&s;e &s;umits were</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Arrayed with reflected purple and gold,</L>
<L>And colours dipt in heav'n.&endq;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="90" REF="108">
AT the clo&s;e of the evening I arrived at U&s;tar; regretting
that our day's journey was concluded, and not feeling in the
lea&s;t fatigued with a walk of eighteen miles, from Rapper|&s;chwyl
to U&s;tar; &s;o greatly had I been occupied and delighted
with the beauties of this romantic country. U&s;tar is a large
pari&s;h, containing 3000 &s;ouls; the wooden cottages are neat
and commodious, re&s;emble tho&s;e in the canton of Appenzel,
and are di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;ame manner over the hills and
dales.</P>
<P>THE &s;un had &s;carcely ri&s;en before we quitted our beds,
and walked to the ca&s;tle of U&s;tar. It &s;tands boldly on an
elevated rock, planted to its very &s;ummit with vines, and
commands a mo&s;t exten&s;ive view, bounded by the Jura, the
mountains of the Black Fore&s;t, and the chain of alps &s;tretch|ing
from the canton of Appenzel to the confines of the
Vallais. Below and around, the country re&s;embled the mo&s;t
cultivated and enclo&s;ed parts of England; a &s;mall lively &s;tream
winded through an immen&s;e plain; while the lake of Greiffen
appeared like a broad river, wa&s;hing the bottom of the ad|jacent
hills. This ca&s;tle was formerly the re&s;idence of the
counts of U&s;tar, who held it and the di&s;trict as a fief from
the counts of Raven&s;purgh, and was at that time a &s;trong
fortre&s;s. On the extinction of that hou&s;e, in the middle of
the fourteenth century, it was transferred to the family of
de Bon&s;tet; and in 1552 was purcha&s;ed by Zuric, and united
to the bailliage of Greiffen&s;ee. M. de Bon&s;tet, whom I have
mentioned as one of our party, derived great &s;atisfaction in
tracing the antiquity and hi&s;tory of this &s;eat, formerly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by his ance&s;tors, and in ob&s;erving the family arms
<PB N="91" REF="109">
painted upon the gla&s;s windows. This ca&s;tle is now a pri|vate
gentleman's hou&s;e, and belongs to Mr. Teyler of Wed|den&s;chweil.</P>
<P>FROM U&s;tar we cro&s;&s;ed the fields, and arrived at the lake
of Greiffen. We walked for &s;ome way upon the turf, along
its borders, under the pendulous branches of oak, beech, and
elms. This lake is of an oblong &s;hape, about &s;ix miles long,
and a mile broad. On one &s;ide the &s;hores are flat, or gently
ri&s;ing; on the other, hills richly wooded. The dearth of
cottages and inhabitants, in this delightful but &s;olitary &s;pot,
formed a &s;triking contra&s;t with the numerous villages we had
recently quitted; while the &s;outhern extremity of the lake
&s;eemed almo&s;t bounded by that magnificent chain of alps,
which con&s;tantly engaged our attention.</P>
<P>HAVING embarked in a &s;mall boat, we pa&s;&s;ed the village
of Greiffen, plea&s;ingly &s;ituated on a &s;mall promontory embo|&s;omed
in a wood, and landed at the northern extremity of
the lake. Here I bathed, and walked on gently, a&s;cending
through fertile grounds, delightfully planted with oak,
beech, and poplars, and innumerable fruit-trees. At a &s;mall
village we &s;topped at the par&s;onage. You can &s;carcely form
to your&s;elf on adequate idea of the neatne&s;s and &s;implicity
which reign in the&s;e parts. The clergyman's two daughters,
about fifteen or &s;ixteen years of age, politely brought milk
and cherries for our refre&s;hment. They were neatly dre&s;t,
like the pea&s;ant girls, in &s;traw hats, their &s;hift-&s;leeves tied, as
is the cu&s;tom of the country, above their elbows. From this
retreat of innocence and &s;implicity we a&s;cended about a mile,
<PB N="92" REF="110">
then bur&s;t upon a charming view of Zuric, the lake, and en|virons;
and, gently de&s;cending, arrived at Zuric, quite en|chanted
with this &s;hort expedition.</P>
<P>AN expedition to the &s;ummit of the Lagerberg was no
le&s;s agreeable than the former excur&s;ion. I procured a guide
and a hor&s;e; but the weather proving very fine, I gave the
hor&s;e to my &s;ervant, and preferred walking acro&s;s the corn|fields,
meadows, and thickets. The fields were enlivened by
the numerous per&s;ons employed in harve&s;t. In the&s;e parts,
as well as the neighbouring countries, I ob&s;erved with plea|&s;ure,
that the oxen, which are chiefly u&s;ed for draught, are
not yoked to the teams or ploughs, but harne&s;&s;ed like hor&s;es.
This cu&s;tom enables tho&s;e animals to perform their labour
with much more ea&s;e, and with greater effect. It has lately
been introduced into &s;ome parts of England; and all unpreju|diced
farmers allow its &s;uperior advantage, as the yoke is ex|tremely
galling; and four oxen harne&s;&s;ed with collars will do
as much work as &s;ix when yoked by the neck. A few miles
from Zuric, I pa&s;&s;ed through the village of Affholteren, near
the church, which is prettily &s;ituated in the middle of a large
field; &s;kirted the &s;mall lake of Ka&s;ten, at a little di&s;tance
from the picture&s;que ruins of Old-Regen&s;berg; and gently
a&s;cended to New-Regen&s;berg, which &s;tands on an elevation,
at the foot of the Lagerberg.</P>
<P>THE counts of Regen&s;berg were powerful barons during
that period of anarchy and confu&s;ion which di&s;tingui&s;hed
the 12th and 13th centuries. They were involved in con|&s;tant
wars, or rather de&s;ultory &s;kirmi&s;hes, with the town of
<PB N="93" REF="111">
Zuric, until they were finally repul&s;ed by Rhodolph of Hab&s;|burgh,
then captain-general of the troops of Zuric. On the
extinction of the counts of Regen&s;berg, in the 14th century,
their territory devolved to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and in 1409,
became &s;ubject to Zuric.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent burgh is inhabited by about 200 per&s;ons:
who enjoy con&s;iderable privileges. They have their burgo|ma&s;ter,
and a council of &s;ix members, who form the civil
court of ju&s;tice, from who&s;e deci&s;ion an appeal lies directly
to Zuric. The criminal juri&s;diction belongs to the bailif,
who re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle. This building was formerly of
great &s;trength, and frequently defied the attacks of Zuric.
The greate&s;t part of the pre&s;ent edifice was con&s;tructed in
the la&s;t century; the only remains of the antient fortre&s;s
being &s;ome &s;tone walls and a round tower, which commands
a di&s;tant pro&s;pect. A well in the middle of the burgh, hol|lowed
in the rock to the depth of 216 feet, which is now
dry, furni&s;hed formerly water to the garri&s;on, during the
ob&s;tinate &s;ieges it maintained before the invention of gun|powder.
Near this well is a copious fountain, which is &s;up|plied
from a &s;pring that ri&s;es in the Lagerberg. The adja|cent
country is a mo&s;t delightful intermixture of hill and
dale. The rock on which Regen&s;berg is built, and which
terminates in an abrupt precipice, forms the ea&s;tern extre|mity
of that va&s;t chain of mountains known by the general
name of Jura, the branches of which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by
different appellations. The branch that ri&s;es from this point
is called the <HI>Lagerberg,</HI> to the &s;ummit of which I mounted
on hor&s;eback. I pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome way through cultivated
<PB N="94" REF="112">
enclo&s;ures, and afterwards through fore&s;ts of pine, fir, and
beech, until I reached the highe&s;t point, on which &s;tands a
&s;ignal-hou&s;e. From this point, which overlooks the whole
country, I enjoyed one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and uninter|rupted
pro&s;pects, and particularly the fine&s;t di&s;tant view of
the Alps, which I had yet &s;een in Switzerland.</P>
<P>To the north, the eye expatiates freely over the wilds of
the Black Fore&s;t; to the ea&s;t, beyond the confines of Ba|varia;
towards the we&s;t, traces the branches of the Jura ex|tending
in multifarious directions; to the &s;outh, looks down
upon the fertile and enclo&s;ed regions in the canton of Zuric,
on the lake and its populous banks, and admires the va&s;t
expan&s;e of country &s;welling from plains to acclivities, from
acclivities to hills, from hills to mountains, and terminating
in tho&s;e &s;tupendous alps,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Who&s;e heads touch heaven.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>THIS wonderful and &s;ublime pro&s;pect detained me in&s;en|&s;ibly
till the clo&s;e of evening, when I de&s;cended, through
the gloomy fore&s;ts of pine, fir, and beech, that clothe the
&s;ides of the Lagerberg; and, filled with tho&s;e plea&s;ing but
melancholy reflections which the inde&s;cribable beauties of
nature leave upon the mind, I rode &s;lowly on, and did not
arrive at Zuric till the gloom of night had over&s;pread the
horizon.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 11.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WINTERTHUR&mdash;CASTLE OF KYBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>WINTERTHUR &s;tands about twelve miles from
Zuric; a town which, although &s;ituated in the can|ton,
and under the protection of Zuric, yet retains its own
laws, has its own magi&s;trates, and is in a great mea&s;ure inde|pendent.
Winterthur was formerly governed by its own
counts, who were probably a branch of the Kyburgh family,
for both hou&s;es bore the &s;ame coat of arms. In the 14th
century it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Hartman, count of Kyburgh, who
fir&s;t &s;urrounded it with walls; and upon his death it de|volved
to his nephew Rhodolph of Hab&s;burgh. Rhodolph,
afterwards emperor, conferred upon the inhabitants con&s;i|derable
privileges, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in the war in which he
was engaged with Ottocar, king of Bohemia. It continued
&s;ubject to his de&s;cendants until 1424, when the inhabitants
claimed the protection, and obtained the alliance, of Zuric.
In 1467, the archduke Sigi&s;mond having &s;old his rights to
Zuric, that canton &s;ucceeded to his prerogatives. A deputy
from Zuric re&s;ides at Winterthur, but for no other pur|po&s;e
than for collecting the toll, half of which belongs to
Zuric.</P>
<P>THE government of Winterthur is ari&s;tocratical. The
&s;upreme power, in all things not interfering with the claims
of Zuric, re&s;ides in the Great and Little Council. The&s;e two
<PB N="96" REF="114">
tribunals united are final judges in all criminal procedures,
and pa&s;s &s;entence of death without appeal. The Little
Council is inve&s;ted with the general admini&s;tration of af|fairs,
and determines civil cau&s;es in the fir&s;t re&s;ort. From
their deci&s;ion an appeal lies to the Great Council, and in
all proce&s;&s;es between a &s;tranger and a burgher, to the &s;enate
of Zuric.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the town is con&s;idered as independent, and
only under the protection of Zuric, yet that canton claims the
right of re&s;tricting the inhabitants from manufacturing &s;ilk,
and from e&s;tabli&s;hing a printing-pre&s;s, as interfering with the
natives of Zuric. This re&s;triction has occa&s;ioned, and &s;till
continues to excite, ill-will between the two towns, and has
given ri&s;e to much litigation. And though Zuric did not
prohibit the manufactures of &s;ilk, yet by forbidding the pea|&s;ants
of the canton from preparing and &s;pinning the mate|rials,
this order amounted to a virtual prohibition. At pre|&s;ent
a &s;imilar di&s;pute is in agitation concerning the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of a printing-pre&s;s at Winterthur. The right will
&s;carcely be controverted; but as the cau&s;e will be finally
determined by Zuric, it remains a doubt whether that go|vernment
will be &s;ufficiently di&s;intere&s;ted to decide in favour
of Winterthur again&s;t its own burghers. In all other re|&s;pects,
excepting in the&s;e two articles of trade &s;o profitable to
Zuric, the commerce of Winterthur lies under no re&s;traint.
The principal manufactures are mu&s;lins, printed cottons, and
cloth. Some vitriol-works are carried on with con&s;iderable
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="115">
THE town is &s;mall, and its inhabitants amount to about
two thou&s;and; who are for the mo&s;t part remarkably indu&s;|trious.
The &s;chools in this petty &s;tate are well endowed
and regulated. The public library contains a &s;mall collec|tion
of books, and a great number of Roman coins and
medals, chiefly found at Ober-Winterthur; among the mo&s;t
rare I ob&s;erved a Didius Julianus and a Pertinax. Ober-Winterthur,
or Upper Winterthur, at pre&s;ent only a &s;mall
village near the town, in the high road leading to Frauen|field,
is the &s;ite of the antient <HI>Vitodurum,</HI> a Roman &s;tation,
and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable place in this neighbourhood. No
other remains of its former con&s;equence &s;ub&s;i&s;t but the
foundations of antient walls, and the numerous Roman coins
and medals which have been di&s;covered. The Roman road,
which once traver&s;ed the mar&s;hes between Winterthur and
Frauenfield, is no longer vi&s;ible, becau&s;e it forms the founda|tion
of the pre&s;ent high-road.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle of Kyburgh, towering on the &s;ummit of
an eminence which overlooks Winterthur and the adja|cent
di&s;trict, is a picture&s;que object; and remarkable in the
hi&s;tory of this country, during the times of confu&s;ion
which preceded and followed the interregnum of the em|pire.
In the beginning of the 12th century, the counts
of Kyburgh po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the counties of Kyburgh, Lentz|burgh,
and Baden; and their territories were further in|crea&s;ed
by the acce&s;&s;ion of Burgdorf and Thun, which fell to
Ulric<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Some authors a&s;&s;ert that Werner, &s;on of Ulric, was the hu&s;band of Anne. Great confu&s;ion reigned in the early hi&s;tory of the Counts of Kyburgh, until Fue&s;sli cleared it up. See article Kyburgh in Fue&s;sli's Erdbe&s;chreibung.</NOTE> in right of his wife Anne, &s;i&s;ter of Berchtold V. duke
<PB N="98" REF="116">
of Zaeringen, upon the demi&s;e of the latter without i&s;&s;ue male.
The&s;e domains devolved, in 1273, to Rhodolph count of
Hab&s;burgh, on the death of his uncle Hartman the elder, the
la&s;t count of Kyburgh. This inheritance rendered Rhodolph
one of the mo&s;t powerful princes in the&s;e parts; and proba|bly
opened his way to the imperial throne. Before his de|cea&s;e,
the emperor ceded to his &s;on Rhodolph and his heirs
the county of Kyburgh, and his other dominions in Swit|zerland;
and, on the demi&s;e of his &s;on, confirmed this grant
to his grand&s;on John, the &s;ame who a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated his uncle,
the emperor Albert<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 14.</NOTE>, and was called the Parricide.</P>
<P>UPON Albert's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the &s;ons of that emperor
&s;eized and kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Kyburgh and the other hereditary
domains in Switzerland, and tran&s;mitted them to their po&s;te|rity.
In 1414, the emperor Sigi&s;mond put under the ban of
the empire Frederic duke of Au&s;tria, and granted for a &s;um
of money the county of Kyburgh to Zuric. In 1442 it was
re&s;tored to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; but, in 1452, was finally
ceded to Zuric by Sigi&s;mond, archduke of Au&s;tria, in order
to liquidate a debt which he owed to the canton. From
that time it has formed a bailliage in the canton of Zuric; but
the title of Count of Kyburgh has been always retained by
the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and is &s;till a&s;&s;umed by its pre&s;ent illu&s;|trious
de&s;cendant Jo&s;eph the Second.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle of Kyburgh, which &s;tands in a romantic and
wild &s;ituation, has been con&s;tructed at different periods.
Part is antient, and not improbably the &s;ame as exi&s;ted in the
<PB N="99" REF="117">
time of Rhodolph; although I could not di&s;cover a date an|terior
to 1424, the year in which it was granted to Zuric. In
an apartment which was formerly a &s;table, I ob&s;erved the
portraits of all the bailifs who have re&s;ided in the ca&s;tle from
the time of its ce&s;&s;ion to Zuric. The bailif enjoys greater
powers than are u&s;ually delegated by an ari&s;tocratical govern|ment.
In criminal proceedings, he is only required to con|&s;ult
the jury of the di&s;trict, though he is not bound by their
opinion, and can inflict capital puni&s;hment without the
nece&s;&s;ity of referring the &s;entence to be confirmed by Zuric.</P>

<P>FROM Winterthur I pa&s;&s;ed to Frauenfield, a &s;mall town,

&s;carcely a thou&s;and, inhabitants; and only remarkable as

at the memorable revolution of 1308<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 25.</NOTE>. The acce&s;&s;ion
of Zuric, Berne, Lucerne, Zug, and Glarus, gave &s;trength
and &s;olidity to this union, and a century and a half elap&s;ed
before a new member was admitted. At length, in 1501,
Friburgh and Soleure being, after much difficulty, received
into the league; upon that occa&s;ion the eight antient cantons
entered into a covenant, called the <HI>Convention of Stantz,</HI> by
which the articles of union and mutual protection were
finally &s;ettled<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 26.</NOTE>. No change therein has been effected by the

terms which Friburgh and Soleure had accepted. Without
entering into a minute detail, I &s;hall endeavour, in this
<PB N="101" REF="119">
letter, to lay before you a &s;hort view of the Helvetic con|federacy.</P>
<P>THE code of public law, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, between

and upon the treaty of peace concluded in 1712, at Arau, be|tween
the Prote&s;tant and Catholic cantons. It appears from
the&s;e &s;everal treaties, which include or enlarge tho&s;e that
preceded, that the Helvetic union is a perpetual <HI>defen&s;ive</HI>
alliance between the thirteen independent contracting powers,
to protect each other by their united forces again&s;t all foreign
enemies. Accordingly, if any member of the union &s;hould

<P>After having given a de&s;cription of the Helvetic union, he concludes the relation as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;So far are they (the thirteen cantons) from making one body or one common|wealth, that only the three old cantons are directly allied with every one of the other twelve. There is indeed &s;uch a connection e&s;tabli&s;hed between them, that, in ca&s;e any one canton were attacked, all the other twelve would be obliged to march to its &s;uccour; but it would be by virtue of the relation, that two cantons may have a third, and not of any direct alliance &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between every one of them.

<P>The above-cited account of the Hel|vetic union, would better have &s;uited the league of the eight cantons before the con|vention of Stantz; when the confederate &s;tates were not &s;o ab&s;olutely and directly united together as they are at pre&s;ent; and their alliance did not perhaps totally exclude every treaty of the &s;ame kind with other powers. It was only by the articles of that celebrated convention, and the alliance of the eight cantons with Friburgh and Soleure, that the union became ab&s;olutely fixed and general. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that &s;everal Swi&s;s hi&s;torians have given the &s;ame idea of the Helvetic union as that above-mentioned: and that even now, au|thors differ con&s;iderably upon &s;ome impor|tant articles of the league.</P></NOTE> whole confederate body; and in ca&s;e of
<PB N="102" REF="120">
war, the &s;everal forces to be &s;upplied by each canton are
preci&s;ely &s;pecified. It appears, however, from the &s;tipula|tions
to which the five cantons agreed, that they do not, in
every re&s;pect, enjoy equal prerogatives with the eight an|tient
cantons. For, the latter re&s;erved to them&s;elves a right,
if the que&s;tion for declaring war again&s;t any foreign &s;tate
&s;hould be <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> carried in their a&s;&s;embly, to require
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the five other cantons, without a&s;&s;igning the
motive: whereas the &s;ive cantons cannot commence ho&s;tili|ties
without the con&s;ent of the confederates; and if the
enemy &s;hould be willing to enter into a negociation con|cerning
the matter in di&s;pute, it mu&s;t be referred to the arbi|tration
of the eight antient cantons. It is further &s;tipulated,
that if a rupture &s;hould en&s;ue between the eight cantons, the
five are to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality.</P>
<P>THE next e&s;&s;ential object of the league, is to pre&s;erve ge|neral
peace and good order. It is therefore covenanted, that
all public di&s;putes &s;hall be finally &s;ettled between the con|tending
<PB N="103" REF="121">
parties in an amicable manner; and for this purpo&s;e
particular judges and arbiters are appointed, who &s;hall be
empowered to compo&s;e the di&s;&s;en&s;ions that may happen to
ari&s;e. To this is added, a reciprocal guarantee of the forms
of government e&s;tabli&s;hed in the re&s;pective commonwealths:
for, in order to prevent internal factions, and revolts in any
of the allied cantons, it was agreed by the convention of
Stantz, that, in ca&s;e of rebellion, the magi&s;tracy of &s;uch can|ton
&s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the forces of the others. Ac|cordingly,
the hi&s;tory of Switzerland affords many in&s;tances
of protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance reciprocally given between the
confederates, in defence and &s;upport of the re&s;pective go|vernments.</P>
<P>No &s;eparate engagement, which any of the cantons may
conclude, can be valid, if incon&s;i&s;tent with the fundamental
articles of this general union: or in other words, the reci|procal
contract between the members of the league, &s;uper|&s;edes
every other &s;pecies of public obligation. With the&s;e
exceptions, the &s;everal combined &s;tates are independent of
each other: they may form alliances with any power, or
reject the &s;ame, although all the others have acceded to it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The five cantons which agreed not to conclude any treaty without the con&s;ent of the eight, are nece&s;&s;arily excluded from this power, together with tho&s;e particular cantons, which have bound them&s;elves by private treaties not to contract any foreign alliance, without the reciprocal con&s;ent of the others; as for in&s;tance, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, by the alliance at Brun|nen in 1315. But this depends upon par|ticular treaties, and has no relation to the general union. In fact, every canton is re|&s;trained by the general articles of the Hel|vetic union: but, conforming to tho&s;e, no one republic is in any other in&s;tance con|trouled by the re&s;olutions of the majority among the confederate cantons.</NOTE>;

perform every other act of ab&s;olute &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>THE public affairs of the Helvetic body and their allies
are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and determined in the &s;everal diets: and the&s;e
are, 1. General diets; or general a&s;&s;emblies of the thirteen
cantons, and of their allies. 2. Particular diets; as tho&s;e of
the eight antient cantons; tho&s;e of the Prote&s;tant cantons,
with the deputies of the Prote&s;tants of Glarus and Appenzel,
of the towns of St. Gallen, Bienne, and Mulhau&s;en, called the
<HI>evangelical conferences;</HI> tho&s;e of the Roman Catholic cantons,
with the deputies of the Catholics of Glarus and Appenzel,
of the abbot of St. Gallen, and of the republic of the Vallais,
called the <HI>golden alliance:</HI> as al&s;o the diets of particular
cantons, which, be&s;ide being members of the general con|federacy,
have di&s;tinct and &s;eparate treaties with each other.</P>
<P>THE ordinary meetings of the <HI>general</HI> diet are held once
a year, and continue &s;itting one month; the extraordinary
a&s;&s;emblies are &s;ummoned upon particular occa&s;ions. It is
principally convened in order to deliberate upon the be&s;t
mea&s;ures for the &s;ecurity of the Helvetic body. The canton
of Zuric appoints the time and place of meeting; and con|venes
the deputies by a circular letter. The deputy of
Zuric al&s;o pre&s;ides, unle&s;s the diet is held in the territory of
any other canton; in that ca&s;e, the deputy of that canton is
pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>THIS diet formerly met at Baden; but &s;ince the conclu|&s;ion
of the civil war in 1712, between Zuric and Berne on
<PB N="105" REF="123">
one &s;ide, and Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, Underwalden, and
Zug, on the other, (when the five latter renounced the co|regency
of Baden) it has been a&s;&s;embled at Frauenfield in
Thurgau. Each canton &s;ends as many deputies as it thinks
proper.</P>
<P>IT would be de&s;cending into a tedious detail, were I to
enter into the particular connections of the &s;everal allies,
either with the whole Helvetic body, or with &s;ome of the
cantons; and the different nature of the&s;e re&s;pective alliances.
Suffer me only to remark, that the allies may be divided into
<HI>a&s;&s;ociate,</HI> and <HI>confederate</HI> &s;tates: of the former, are the abbot
and town of St. Gallen, Bienne, and Mulhau&s;en; of the latter,
are the Gri&s;ons, the republic of the Vallais, Geneva, Neu|chatel,
and the bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le. The &s;tates thus comprized
under the general denomination of a&s;&s;ociates and confe|derates,
enjoy, by virtue of this union, a total independence
on all foreign dominion; and partake of all the privileges
and immunities granted to the Swi&s;s in other countries.
And notwith&s;tanding &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tates are allied only with
particular cantons; yet if any of them &s;hould be attacked,
tho&s;e cantons with whom they are in treaty would not only
&s;upply them with &s;uccours, but would require the joint
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the remaining cantons: &s;hould therefore any
part of the whole body be invaded, all the other members
would unite in its defence, either as immediate guarantees,
or as auxiliaries of the actual guarantees.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 13.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ROUTE BY WATER FROM ZURIC TO BADEN&mdash;
BRIDGE OF WETTINGEN&mdash;BADEN&mdash;CASTLE
OF HAPSBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>INSTEAD of following the u&s;ual route by land from
Zuric to Ba&s;le, we proceeded the greate&s;t part of the way
by water. We embarked about two in the afternoon on the
Limmat. The navigation of that river has been de&s;cribed
as extremely hazardous, yet it is only dangerous upon the
melting of the &s;now, or after violent rains, when in &s;everal
places the rocks and &s;hoals are covered with water. At other
times there is no danger, provided the watermen are &s;ober
and experienced. Our boat was flat-bottomed and long, and
was rowed, or rather &s;teered by three watermen, who u&s;ed
their oars merely to direct the ve&s;&s;el; the &s;tream being &s;uf|ficiently
rapid to carry us along at the rate of &s;ix, eight, and
&s;ometimes even ten miles in the hour. The water is beau|tifully
tran&s;parent; and its &s;urface was occa&s;ionally rai&s;ed
and agitated with high waves by a wind oppo&s;ite to the cur|rent.
The borders of the Limmat are at fir&s;t &s;omewhat flat,
afterwards gently ri&s;e into hills clothed with pa&s;ture and
wood, or divided into vineyards; are la&s;tly quite perpendicu|lar,
and fringed to the water's edge with hanging trees.
About a mile from Baden, where the Limmat flows with the
greate&s;t rapidity, we &s;hot under the bridge of Wettingen
with &s;uch velocity, that in the moment of admiring its bold
<PB REF="125">
<FIGURE>
<P>$span$</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="107" REF="126">
projection on one &s;ide, I imperceptibly found my&s;elf on the
other. This beautiful piece of mechani&s;m is a wooden bridge,
two hundred and forty feet in length, and &s;u&s;pended above
twenty feet from the &s;urface of the water: it was the la&s;t
work of Grubenman, the &s;elf-taught architect, whom I men|tioned
in a former letter, and is far &s;uperior in elegance to
that of Schaffhau&s;en.</P>
<P>WE landed at Baden, and walked to Hap&s;burgh, Schintz|nach,
Konigsfelden, and Windi&s;h; of which places I &s;hall
give you a &s;hort de&s;cription. Baden derives its name from
the neighbouring warm baths, which are mentioned by the
antients under the appellations of <HI>Aquae</HI> and <HI>Thermae Helve|ticae.</HI>
Baden was a Roman fortre&s;s, erected to curb the <HI>Alle|manni</HI>
or Germans; and was ra&s;ed to the ground, when
the Helvetians, who &s;upported Otho, were routed by Caecina,
general to Vitellius. Being rebuilt, it was taken by the Ger|mans;
fell afterwards under the dominion of the Franks;
was, in the tenth century, incorporated in the German em|pire;
became &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ubject to the dukes of Zaeringen,
to the counts of Kyburgh, and to Rhodolph of Hap&s;burgh.
In 1415, when his de&s;cendant Frederic, duke of Au&s;tria, was
put under the ban of the empire, the canton of Zuric took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town and county; and, having purcha&s;ed
them from the emperor Sigi&s;mond, admitted to a joint &s;hare
in the &s;overeignty, Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, Underwalden,
and Zug, Berne in 1426, and Uri in 1445.</P>
<P>BADEN continued a bailliage of the&s;e eight cantons until the
year 1712, when the civil war breaking out between the Pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="108" REF="127">
and Catholic cantons, it was be&s;ieged and taken by
the troops of Zuric and Berne; and at the peace of Arau
was ceded to tho&s;e two cantons and Glarus, which, on ac|count
of its neutrality, pre&s;erved its right of joint-&s;ove|reignty.
Zuric and Berne did not, however, prove their
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, when, not content with finally &s;ettling
the religious di&s;putes in favour of the Prote&s;tants, they
exacted from the Catholic cantons the ce&s;&s;ion of Baden,
contrary to the convention of Stantz, which forms the
ba&s;is of the Helvetic con&s;titution. The umbrage conceiv|ed
by the Catholic cantons at this &s;tep, was the principal
inducement to conclude a perpetual alliance with France
in 1715, and to throw them&s;elves under the protection of
that power. And this &s;eparate league has not been an|nulled
by the general treaty which Louis XVI. contract|ed
with the thirteen cantons in 1776. Until 1712, the
diet of the thirteen cantons a&s;&s;embled at Baden; but has
been &s;ince transferred to Frauenfield. The three cantons
alternately appoint a bailif, who re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle. The
inhabitants elect their own magi&s;trates, and have their own
judicial courts. In civil proceedings, an appeal lies to the
bailif, and from his deci&s;ion to the &s;yndicate, compo&s;ed of the
deputies of the three cantons, and in the la&s;t re&s;ort to the
three cantons them&s;elves. In penal cau&s;es, the criminal court
condemns, and the bailif enjoys the power of pardoning, or
mitigating the &s;entence. The county or bailliage contains
about 24,000 &s;ouls.</P>
<P>FROM Baden we walked through an agreeable and well|wooded
country for &s;ome way along the &s;ide of the Limmat,
<PB N="109" REF="128">
who&s;e &s;teep banks are covered with vines to the edge of the
water; and in about two hours cro&s;&s;ed the Reu&s;s into the
canton of Berne. Having pa&s;&s;ed through a plain, we arrived
at the baths of Schintznach, a place remarkable for its agree|able
po&s;ition on the banks of the Aar, and its tepid mineral
waters. It is al&s;o well known as being the fir&s;t place where
the Helvetic &s;ociety a&s;&s;embled. This &s;ociety, formed by
&s;ome of the mo&s;t learned men in Switzerland, both of the
Catholic and Reformed religion, fir&s;t helped to extend the
&s;pirit of toleration, and to le&s;&s;en that antipathy which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between the members of the two per&s;ua&s;ions. Its pub|lications
have tended to promote a general zeal for the dif|fu&s;ion
of polite literature. The meeting of this liberal &s;o|ciety
is now transferred to Olten, a &s;mall town in the canton
of Soleure.</P>
<P>NEAR Schintznach &s;tands, on a lofty eminence, the ruins
of the ca&s;tle of Hap&s;burgh, to which we a&s;cended through a
wood of beech, that &s;eemed almo&s;t coeval with the date of
the ca&s;tle. The ruins con&s;i&s;t of an antient tower, con&s;tructed
with ma&s;&s;y &s;tones, in a rude &s;tyle of architecture, and part of
a &s;mall building of much later date. It was erected in the
beginning of the eleventh century, by Werner, bi&s;hop of
Stra&s;burgh, came to his brothers Radebot and Latzelin, and
devolved to their de&s;cendants. Otho, grand&s;on of Radebot,
was probably the fir&s;t per&s;on upon record who &s;tyled him&s;elf
count of Hap&s;burgh, and it continued to be the principal title
by which his po&s;terity was di&s;tingui&s;hed, until it was lo&s;t in a
greater dignity, when Rhodolph of Hap&s;burgh was elevated
to the imperial throne. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors granted the ca&s;tle and
<PB N="110" REF="129">
its dependencies as a fief, to the lords of Wildeck, and after|wards
to the lord of Wolen: in 1415 it was occupied by
Berne, during the conte&s;t between the emperor Sigi&s;mond
and Frederic of Au&s;tria, and given to the family of Sege&s;ern
of Bruneck. In 1469, it was &s;old to the convent of Konig&s;|felden;
on the di&s;&s;olution of that mona&s;tery, at the reforma|tion,
was &s;eculari&s;ed, and &s;eized by government; has gradu|ally
gone to decay; and is now inhabited by a pea&s;ant's fa|mily.</P>
<P>THIS ca&s;tle commands an unbounded view over hills and
dales, plains and fore&s;ts, rivers and lakes, towns and villages,
mountains and alps, emblem of that extent of power to which
the talents of <HI>one man,</HI> who derived his title from this ca&s;tle,
rai&s;ed him&s;elf and his de&s;cendants. You will readily perceive
I allude to Rhodolph of Hap&s;burgh, who, from a &s;imple ba|ron
of Switzerland, became emperor, and founded the Hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria. Rhodolph was born in 1218. After &s;ignalizing
his youth in a con&s;tant &s;cene of warfare and contention, he
was, in 1273, unexpectedly rai&s;ed to the dignity of emperor,
and conferred honour on that exalted &s;tation, no le&s;s by his
political &s;agacity than by his military prowe&s;s. He died
in 1291, after a long and glorious reign, and in the &s;eventy-third
year of his age.</P>
<P>IMPRESSED with the&s;e ideas, as I con&s;idered, on the very
&s;pot, the origin of the Hou&s;e of Hap&s;burgh, and its gradual
progre&s;s towards that height of power which it has &s;ince at|tained
under the more di&s;tingui&s;hed appellation of the Hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria; I could not but compare it to a &s;mall rill in the
<PB N="111" REF="130">
Alps, who&s;e &s;ource is uncertain; which having received
numberle&s;s &s;treams, forms no incon&s;iderable river. Flowing
through Switzerland, &s;till almo&s;t unknown to its neighbours,
it no &s;ooner enters Germany, than it lo&s;es its name by its
junction with the Danube; and, having collected the tribute
of numberle&s;s rivers, rolls, with accumulated and &s;till in|crea&s;ing
waters, through an immen&s;e extent of country, and
falls by a hundred mouths into the Euxine Sea;</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;et pare</L>
<L>Che guerra porta e non tributo al mare<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ta&s;&s;o.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>RHODOLPH, during his re&s;idence in this ca&s;tle, would not
have given credit to a per&s;on endowed with the &s;pirit of pro|phecy,
who &s;hould have informed him, that, in little more
than a century, a few &s;mall republics would drive his de|&s;cendants
from their hereditary dominions in Switzerland;
and erect upon their ruins, and on the ba&s;is of equal liberty,
a formidable confederacy, which would be courted by the
mo&s;t powerful &s;overeigns. Still le&s;s perhaps would he have
believed, that he him&s;elf &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the imperial throne,
and found the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; that his lineal de&s;cendants
&s;hould rule over Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, Au&s;tria,
Spain, Burgundy, the Low Countries, Milan, Naples, and
Sicily, and extend their dominion and influence from the
&s;hores of the Euxine to a New World beyond the Atlantic.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;atisfied our curio&s;ity at the ca&s;tle of Hap&s;|burgh<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is al&s;o a ca&s;tle of Hap&s;burgh, &s;ituated near the lake of Lucerne, which I vi&s;ited in 1779. Some authors have erro|neou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, that this was the ca&s;tle from which the counts derived their titles. But Hergot has refuted this opinion; and un|que&s;tionably proved that honour to be due to the ca&s;tle of Hap&s;burgh, which I have de|&s;cribed in the preceding letter. See Hergot Gen. Dipl. Aug&s;. Domus Hab&s;b.</NOTE>,
that cradle of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which
&s;till confers a title on the pre&s;ent emperor, we de&s;cended into
the plain of Konigsfelden, to a convent of the &s;ame name,
built by Elizabeth, on the &s;pot where her hu&s;band, the em|peror
Albert I. was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. The occa&s;ion of this a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination,
and the circum&s;tances attending it, were as follow.
Albert, as guardian to his nephew John of Hap&s;burgh, had
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary dominions in Switzerland,
and refu&s;ed, under various pretences, to deliver them up to
him. At length, wearied with repeated and fruitle&s;s &s;olici|tations,
John entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the emperor,
with Rhodolph de Warth, Ulric de Palme, Walther de E&s;chen|bach,
and Conrad de Tagerfeld.</P>
<P>THE emperor dined at Baden, in his way to Rheinfelden,
a town in the circle of Suabia, where the empre&s;s his con|&s;ort
had collected a con&s;iderable body of troops, with which
<PB N="113" REF="132">
he propo&s;ed invading the three cantons of Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden, which had revolted again&s;t him. Con|temporary
hi&s;torians, who have recorded the minute&s;t cir|cum&s;tances
in this whole tran&s;action, relate, that Albert was
in high &s;pirits during the repa&s;t; and that, his nephew again
entreating to be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary domi|nions,
the emperor, with an air of banter, placed a garland of
flowers upon his head, adding, at the &s;ame time, &startq;This will
be more &s;uitable to you, for the pre&s;ent, than the cares
of a trouble&s;ome government.&endq; This taunt had &s;uch an
effect upon the young prince, that he bur&s;t into tears, flung
away the flowers, and could not be prevailed upon to &s;it
down to table. After dinner, Albert continued his journey
on hor&s;eback, accompanied by his &s;on Leopold, the con&s;pi|rators,
and his u&s;ual attendants; and came near the town of
Windi&s;h, in the canton of Berne, to the Reu&s;s, over which
river pa&s;&s;engers were u&s;ually ferried upon a raft. The con|&s;pirators
pa&s;&s;ed over fir&s;t, and were followed by Albert: as
he was riding gently on, expecting his &s;on Leopold, and the
remainder of his &s;uite, he was &s;uddenly be&s;et by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.
One of them &s;eizing his hor&s;e's bridle, John of Hap&s;burgh
reproached him for his inju&s;tice in detaining his dominions;
and &s;truck him on the neck with his &s;word: Rhodolph de
Warth wounded him in the &s;ide; and Ulric de Palme clove
his head with a &s;abre. In this condition, they left him expir|ing
upon the ground.</P>
<P>THIS a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was committed the fir&s;t of May 1308,
in the open day, and in the &s;ight of his &s;on Leopold, and the
re&s;t of his court, who had not as yet pa&s;&s;ed the river; and
<PB N="114" REF="133">
who, though witne&s;&s;es to the murder, yet could not a&s;&s;i&s;t
the emperor. The field lies between the Aar and the Reu&s;s,
not far from the junction of tho&s;e two rivers; and the very
&s;pot, where he was ma&s;&s;acred, is marked by a convent, erected
by his wife Elizabeth and his daughter Agnes: the place
was called <HI>Konigsfelden,</HI> or King'sfield; a name it retains to
this day. The remains of the emperor were buried in the
convent of Witterling, from whence they were afterwards
tran&s;ported to Spire, and there interred.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins e&s;caped into the cantons of Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden, expecting to find a &s;ure a&s;ylum in a na|tion,
which Albert was preparing to invade. But the gene|rous
natives, dete&s;ting a crime of &s;o atrocious a nature, al|though
committed upon the per&s;on of their greate&s;t and
mo&s;t formidable enemy, refu&s;ed to protect the murderers.
D'E&s;chenbach concealed him&s;elf in the di&s;gui&s;e of a common
labourer during thirty years, nor was his rank di&s;covered till
he confe&s;&s;ed it upon his death-bed; De Palme, de&s;titute of com|mon
nece&s;&s;aries, died in extreme poverty; De Warth, tied to a
hor&s;e's tail, like a common malefactor, and dragged to the
place of execution, was broken upon the wheel. John of

this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>THE convent or abbey of Konigsfelden comprized, with|in
its exten&s;ive precincts, a nunnery of the order of St. Clare,
and a mona&s;tery of monks of the order of minorites, &s;e|parted
from each other by a wall. It was richly endowed
by Elizabeth, her five &s;ons, and her daughter Agnes queen
of Hungary, who a&s;&s;umed the habit of a nun, and here
pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of her days. At the reformation the
abbey was &s;ecularized, and its lands appropriated by govern|ment:
part of the building became the re&s;idence of the
bailif, part was converted into an ho&s;pital, and part was &s;uf|fered
to fall to ruin. Many of the cells, formerly occupied
by the nuns, &s;till exi&s;t in their original &s;tate; and one, in
particular, is di&s;tingui&s;hed as the habitation in which queen
Agnes lived and died. The chapel &s;till remains entire, but
is no longer u&s;ed for divine &s;ervice. The gla&s;s windows are
beautifully coloured, and painted with various hi&s;tories of the
Old Te&s;tament; with the portraits of Elizabeth and Agnes, of
the emperor Albert, and his &s;ons. On the walls al&s;o are
coar&s;ely repre&s;ented the figures of Leopold duke of Au&s;tria,
and the principal nobles who peri&s;hed at the battle of Sempach.
Elizabeth and Agnes, and &s;everal princes and prince&s;&s;es of the
<PB N="116" REF="135">
Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, were buried in this chapel; but their
bones were a few years ago removed to the abbey of St.
Blai&s;e, in the Black Fore&s;t, where they were depo&s;ited with
great pomp, and magnificent &s;epulchres erected to their
memory.</P>
<P>NEAR Konigsfelden is the &s;mall village of Windi&s;h,
&s;tanding at the conflux of the Aar and the Reu&s;s, and &s;up|po&s;ed
by antiquarians to occupy the &s;ite of <HI>Vindoni&s;&s;a,</HI> a Ro|man
fortre&s;s mentioned by Tacitus. In traver&s;ing the place
I did not ob&s;erve the lea&s;t &s;igns of any antiquities; but vari|ous
lapidary in&s;criptions, mile-&s;tones, &s;epulchral urns, me|dals,
coins, and gems, which have been found in great abun|dance,
&s;ufficiently prove, that it mu&s;t have been the &s;tation
of a large Roman colony. The reader, who is inclined to
reflect on the vici&s;&s;itudes of human po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, will recollect
with plea&s;ure a quotation, which &s;o happily relates to the
pre&s;ent &s;ubject: &startq;Within the antient walls of Vindoni&s;&s;a,
the ca&s;tle of Hap&s;burgh, the abbey of Konigsfeld, and the
town of Bruck, have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ari&s;en. The philo&s;ophic
traveller may compare the monuments of Roman con|que&s;t,
of feudal or Au&s;trian tyranny, of monki&s;h &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
and of indu&s;trious freedom. If he be truly a philo|&s;opher,
he will applaud the merit and happine&s;s of his
own time<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. iii. p. 563.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>EARLY the next morning we embarked on the Aar, which,
though here a trifling &s;tream, yet, being con&s;iderably &s;welled
<PB N="117" REF="136">
by the tribute of waters from the Reu&s;s and the Limmat,
&s;oon becomes a con&s;iderable river. Its banks are agreeably
enlivened with meadows and woods, and &s;potted occa&s;ionally
with villages, ca&s;tles, and ruins, hanging on the water's
edge. Having made a &s;mall turn, it falls by a &s;trait channel
into the Rhine, vying in &s;ize and rapidity with the great
river in which it lo&s;es its name: its waters, which are of a
&s;ilvery hue, are for a long way di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of
the Rhine; which, being tran&s;parent, and of a &s;ea-green co|lour,
&s;eem to di&s;dain the union.</P>
<P>THE banks of the Rhine are far &s;uperior in wildne&s;s
and beauty to tho&s;e of the Aar, in many parts ri&s;ing perpen|dicularly,
yet feathered with wood; in others &s;loping in
gentle declivities, richly bordered with vines, fore&s;t, and pa&s;|tures;
and exhibiting a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of towns and
villages. The rapid &s;tream carried us above eighteen miles
in three hours, and we di&s;embarked at Lauffenburgh, where
the Rhine forms a &s;mall cataract, which though greatly in|ferior
to the fall of the &s;ame river near Schaffhau&s;en, yet
de&s;erves to be vi&s;ited by travellers for the beauties of the
&s;cenery. As I &s;tood upon the crags of the northern &s;hore,
the principal objects were, a high bridge, partly open and
partly covered, &s;upported by three lofty &s;tone piers; on the
&s;outh a row of hou&s;es, with an old ruined ca&s;tle on the &s;um|mit,
boldly overhanging the water; a per&s;pective of woods
and meadows under the arcades of the bridge; and the river
da&s;hing over its craggy bed, in a &s;loping cataract, until it
lo&s;es it&s;elf &s;uddenly among the rocks which clo&s;e the view.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="137">
ABOUT half a mile below this fall we re-embarked, and
found the waters in many parts more agitated than tho&s;e of
the Limmat; particularly near Rheinfelden, where they ru&s;h
with &s;uch increa&s;ing velocity, that they were troubled like
the waves of the &s;ea, and, beating again&s;t the boat, turned it
obliquely by their violence. Here we were hurried along
with &s;uch rapidity, that though I had a pencil in my hand, I
had no time for ob&s;ervation, much le&s;s for de&s;cription; I
could only catch a general glance of the romantic &s;cenery, as
we pa&s;&s;ed under a picture&s;que bridge of &s;everal arches, &s;u&s;|pended
high above the &s;urface of the river, and joined to a
&s;teep rock, on which towered &s;ome maje&s;tic ruins. In many
parts, and for a con&s;iderable way, our ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ed within a
few inches of the &s;helving rocks, and was only prevented
from &s;triking again&s;t them by the dexterity of the pilot.
As we approached Ba&s;le the &s;tream became gradually le&s;s
rapid; and we di&s;embarked highly delighted with our
expedition.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 15.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN OF BASLE&mdash;ERASMUS&mdash;LIBRARY&mdash;HOLBEIN.</HEAD>
<P>I Arrived at Ba&s;le, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, about twelve at noon;
but was much &s;urprized to find, that all the clocks in
the town actually &s;truck one: and, on inquiry, I was in|formed,
that they con&s;tantly go an hour fa&s;ter than the real
time. Different rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned for this &s;ingula|rity:
&s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that it was fir&s;t practi&s;ed during the
council of Ba&s;le, in order to a&s;&s;emble, at an earlier hour, the
cardinals and bi&s;hops, who being very lazy and indolent,
always arrived too late. Others maintain, that a con&s;piracy
being formed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the magi&s;trates at midnight; one
of the burgoma&s;ters, who had notice of the de&s;ign, advanced
the town-clock an hour; by which means the con&s;pirators,
imagining they had mi&s;&s;ed the appointed time, retired;
and that the clocks are &s;till kept in the &s;ame advanced &s;tate,
as a perpetual memorial of this happy deliverance. But
there is a third rea&s;on given for this &s;trange cu&s;tom, which
&s;eems the mo&s;t probable. It is well known that the choirs
of cathedrals are con&s;tructed towards the ea&s;t: that of Ba&s;le
declines &s;omewhat from this direction; and the &s;un-dial,
which is placed upon the out&s;ide of the choir, and by which
the town-clock is always regulated, partakes of this declina|tion;
a circum&s;tance which, according to the celebrated
Bernoulli, occa&s;ions a variation from the true time of above
five-and-forty minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="139">
THE inhabitants of Ba&s;le are &s;till &s;o &s;trongly attached to
this whim&s;ical cu&s;tom, that, although it has been often pro|po&s;ed
in the &s;overeign council to regulate their clocks pro|perly,
yet the motion has been invariably rejected; and the
people would &s;u&s;pect that their liberties were invaded, if
their clocks were to agree with tho&s;e of the re&s;t of Europe.
A few years &s;ince, &s;everal leading men of the town deter|mined
to alter the hand of the &s;un-dial half a minute a day,
until the &s;hadow &s;hould imperceptibly point to the true
hour. This expedient was accordingly practi&s;ed, and the
clock had already lo&s;t near three-quarters of an hour, when
an accident di&s;covered the de&s;ign: the magi&s;trates were ac|cordingly
compelled to place the hand of the &s;un-dial in its
former po&s;ition, and to regulate the hours by it as u&s;ual.
Indeed, long-e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, however indifferent or ri|diculous,
are apt to make &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon
vulgar minds, as to become &s;ometimes dangerous, and always
difficult to be aboli&s;hed; e&s;pecially among a people, like
tho&s;e of this country, who are aver&s;e to any change, even
in the minute&s;t articles. I need not remind you, how long
it was before we could be per&s;uaded in England, to reckon
our years according to the general mode of computation
received by the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>BASLE is beautifully &s;ituated upon the banks of the Rhine,
near the point where that river, which here becomes very
broad, deep and rapid, after flowing for &s;ome way from ea&s;t
to we&s;t, turns &s;uddenly to the north. It con&s;i&s;ts of two towns
joined together by a long bridge; the <HI>large</HI> town lies on the
&s;ide of Switzerland, and the <HI>&s;mall</HI> town on the oppo&s;ite banks
<PB N="121" REF="140">
of the river. It &s;tands very favourably for commerce; an
advantage which the inhabitants have by no means neglected:
for they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a great variety of manufactures,
particularly of ribbands and cottons; and an exten&s;ive trade
is carried on by the principal merchants.</P>
<P>THE cathedral is an elegant gothic building, but &s;trangely
disfigured by a daubing of ro&s;e-coloured paint &s;pread over
the whole edifice. This cathedral contains the a&s;hes of Ger|trude
Anne counte&s;s of Hohenburg, and wife of the emperor
Rhodolph I. She died at Vienna, in 1281, and her body was
conveyed to Ba&s;le. Her two chri&s;tian names gave ri&s;e to
much confu&s;ion, and led many hi&s;torians to conclude that
Gertrude and Anne were two different per&s;onages, and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
wives of that emperor; while others ridiculou&s;ly &s;up|po&s;ed
that both were married to him at the &s;ame time:
nor were the&s;e erroneous opinions confuted, and the contro|ver&s;y
finally &s;ettled, till Hergot, the laborious genealogi&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Hergottii Geneal. Diplom. Dom. Au&s;t. vol. i. p. 125.</NOTE>
of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, proved, from the mo&s;t unque&s;|tionable
authorities of antient diplomes, the identity of this
divided per&s;onage; and that the mi&s;take aro&s;e from her
being uniformly &s;tyled Gertrude before her coronation, and
Anne after the performance of that ceremony. She bore to
her hu&s;band fourteen children; and though the mother of
&s;o large a family, yet &s;uch was her extreme &s;en&s;ibility, that
the grief which &s;he &s;uffered at the departure of her daughter
Clementina to Naples, on her marriage with Charles Martel,
hurried the afflicted parent to her grave.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="141">
IN the &s;ame church are depo&s;ited, under a marble tomb,
the venerable remains of the great Era&s;mus. That di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
writer joined to &s;uperior learning, and a peculiar
elegance of &s;tyle, the keene&s;t wit, which he pointed, not
only again&s;t the vices and ignorance of the monks, but the
general corruptions and di&s;orders of the Roman church. He
was indeed the forerunner of Luther, in his fir&s;t attacks
upon the Catholics, re&s;pecting the &s;ale of indulgences: but
afterwards, when the controver&s;y appeared more &s;erious, and
an open breach with the church of Rome &s;eemed inevitable;
he condemned the proceedings of that bold reformer. He
con&s;idered them, indeed, as altogether unwarrantable; and,
although he had him&s;elf cen&s;ured and expo&s;ed the corrup|tions
that infected the Catholic religion; yet he zealou&s;ly
inculcated &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive obedience to the decrees of what he
called the &startq;univer&s;al church.&endq; Agreeably to the&s;e &s;enti|ments,
he advi&s;ed the Prote&s;tants to endeavour at obtaining,
by mild and patient mea&s;ures, what they might indi&s;creetly
lo&s;e by a warmer and more violent oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>SUCH temperate councils were ill &s;uited to the daring and
impetuous &s;pirit of Luther. Accordingly, while Era&s;mus
was acting the part of a mediator, and endeavouring to mo|derate
and allay the flame on each &s;ide, he drew upon him|&s;elf
the di&s;plea&s;ure of both parties: and, in allu&s;ion to this
tempori&s;ing conduct, one of his adver&s;aries applied to him,
not unaptly, that line in Virgil,</P>
<Q>Terras inter caelumque volabat.</Q>
<P>The impartial truth &s;eems to be, that he was by no means
di&s;po&s;ed to become a martyr in the cau&s;e: the natural
<PB N="123" REF="142">
timidity of his temper, a too great deference to per&s;ons of
&s;uperior rank and power, and perhaps al&s;o the fear of lo&s;ing
his pen&s;ions, probably induced him to take a decided part
again&s;t the reformers, and condemn their &s;eparation from
the church of Rome.</P>
<P>But it would be uncandid to impute his conduct wholly
to &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations: &s;omething may fairly be a&s;cribed to
the powerful impre&s;&s;ions of early prejudices; and &s;ome|thing
to that rooted love of peace and &s;tudious tranquillity,
which &s;eems to have been the governing principle of all
his actions. But, whatever imperfections may be di&s;covered
in &s;ome particular parts of his character, his memory mu&s;t
ever be revered by every friend of genius, learning, and mo|deration.
Liveline&s;s of imagination, depth and variety of
erudition, together with great &s;agacity of judgment, were in
him eminently united. He infu&s;ed a &s;pirit of elegance even
into theological controver&s;ies; and contributed to di&s;en|cumber
literature from that &s;chola&s;tic jargon with which it
was di&s;graced. Era&s;mus reflected much honour upon this
town, by choo&s;ing it as the favourite place of his re&s;idence,
and publi&s;hing from hence the greate&s;t part of his valuable
works. In the public library are pre&s;erved, with great ve|neration,
&s;everal of his letters, and his la&s;t te&s;tament, written
with his own hand; as al&s;o his hanger and &s;eal.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;ity of Ba&s;le was formerly eminent in the
literary hi&s;tory of Europe. Who, in the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in
letters, is unacquainted with the celebrated names of Occo|lampadius,
Amerbach, the three Bauhins, Grynaeus, Bux|torf,
<PB N="124" REF="143">
Wet&s;tein, I&s;elin, the Bernoullis, and Euler? If it has
fallen from its pri&s;tine &s;tate of renown, its decline mu&s;t be
principally imputed to the ca&s;ual method of electing the
profe&s;&s;ors; but it &s;till boa&s;ts &s;everal members who do honour
to their native town by their learning and abilities.</P>
<P>THE public library contains a &s;mall collection of books,
chiefly remarkable for &s;everal rare and valuable editions;
particularly of tho&s;e printed in the fifteenth century. The
mo&s;t curious manu&s;cripts are numerous letters of the fir&s;t
reformers, and of other learned men in the fifteenth, &s;ix|teenth,
and &s;eventeenth centuries; and an account of the
proceedings at the council of Ba&s;le. The minutes of that
council were taken by John of Segovia; and are &s;uppo&s;ed to
be the &s;ame which are pre&s;erved either in the library, or in
the archives of the town: the former is written on paper,
the latter on parchment. A que&s;tion has ari&s;en which of
the&s;e two is the original. Some conclude in favour of that
in the archives, on account of the many fal&s;e readings and
mi&s;takes in the other, which are plainly the faults of a
copyi&s;t. Others give the preference to that in the library,
becau&s;e it is written in different hands, and with different
ink, which &s;eem to imply that it was noted down at various
intervals, according as the acts of the council were pa&s;&s;ed;
whereas that in the archives, being penned on parchment,
in the &s;ame hand, and with the &s;ame ink, was probably
copied from the original minutes; for who, it is urged,
would take minutes on parchment? A third opinion &s;till
more probable, is, that neither of the&s;e are the original. Se|veral
pa&s;&s;ages are wanting in both; which omi&s;&s;ion may
<PB N="125" REF="144">
have proceeded from the tran&s;criber's not being able to read
every part of the original. It is probable al&s;o that John
of Segovia took away the minutes, and depo&s;ited them at
Rome; and that one of the&s;e manu&s;cripts was the copy
tran&s;cribed by order of the council; of the&s;e, the manu|&s;cript
on parchment appears to be the mo&s;t authentic.</P>
<P>IN a &s;uite of rooms belonging to this library, is a cabinet
of petrifactions, collected in the canton of Ba&s;le by the Rev.
Mr. Annoni; &s;ome antient medals and gems; a few anti|quities
found at Aug&s;t; a large number of prints; and &s;ome
fine drawings and paintings, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of originals
by Holbein, who was a native of this town. The&s;e pictures
are, mo&s;t of them, in the highe&s;t pre&s;ervation: the con|noi&s;&s;eur
can here trace all the different manners of Holbein,
and compare the productions of his youth with tho&s;e of his
maturer age. A few are here pre&s;erved, which he painted
before he had reached his &s;ixteenth year; and one ex|tremely
curious, which he drew upon a &s;ign for a writing|ma&s;ter.
The portraits of him&s;elf, his wife, and children, in
the &s;ame group, are much admired for nature and &s;implicity
of expre&s;&s;ion. The mo&s;t valuable of the&s;e paintings is an
altar-piece, in eight compartments, which repre&s;ents the
pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour&punc; a performance, in which this ad|mirable
arti&s;t has carried to the highe&s;t perfection, that &s;in|gular
brilliancy of colouring &s;o peculiar to his be&s;t compo|&s;itions.
I was much &s;truck with a profile of his friend and
patron Era&s;mus, writing his commentary upon St. Matthew:
there is a &s;pirit and animation in the countenance, finely
expre&s;&s;ive of the great author's &s;agacious and penetrating ta|lents.
<PB N="126" REF="145">
Among the works of Holbein, that di&s;cover the live|line&s;s
of his fancy, mu&s;t be mentioned the &s;ketches which he
drew, on pur&s;uing the Eulogium of Folly by Era&s;mus, on
the margin of that work, which he received as a pre&s;ent
from the author. This curious volume is pre&s;erved in the
library; and has been lately publi&s;hed by Mr. Haas, in
French, Latin, and German, with fac-&s;imiles of the original
de&s;igns, engraved on wood.</P>
<P>THE dance of death, in the church-yard of the predi|cants
of the &s;uburbs of St. John, is frequently &s;hewn to
&s;trangers as being of Holbein's pencil. It is painted in oil|colours
upon a wall which enclo&s;es the burial-ground: but,
as it has &s;everal times been retouched, no traces are di&s;co|verable
of that great ma&s;ter's hand. In fact, the Hon. Ho|race
Walpole, and other unque&s;tionable judges, have proved,
that this performance was painted before Holbein was born,
and that he was not employed even in retouching it. It is
probable, however, that, from this antient painting, he took
the fir&s;t hint towards compo&s;ing his famous drawings on the
dance of death. In treating this &s;ubject, he has di&s;played &s;uch
wonderful richne&s;s of imagination, and di&s;covered &s;o much
judgment in the di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o much &s;pirit in the exe|cution
of the figures, that Bubens &s;tudied them with particu|lar
attention, and took drawings from them. The originals of
Holbein's dance of death were purcha&s;ed by Mr. Fleichman of
Stra&s;bourg, at the &s;ale of the famous collection of Crozat, at
Paris; of which Mariette has publi&s;hed a catalogue. They
are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of prince Gallitzin, mini&s;ter from
the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia to the court of Vienna. They con&s;i&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="146">
of forty-four &s;mall drawings: the outlines are &s;ketched with
a pen, and they are &s;lightly &s;haded with Indian ink. I had
frequent opportunities of &s;eeing them, during my con|tinuance
at Vienna; and particularly admired the variety of
attitudes and characters in which death is repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>PRINTS have been taken from &s;ome of the&s;e drawings by
Hollar, which are very &s;carce. Mr. de Mechel, a celebrated
arti&s;t of this place, has already engraved them after the ori|ginal
de&s;igns; a work which cannot fail of being highly ac|ceptable
to the admirers of the fine arts. He has added four
engravings, which are not in the prince's collection, and
which are taken from the prints of Hollar. Mr. de Mechel
ingeniou&s;ly conjectures, from the dre&s;&s;es and characters of
&s;everal of the figures in the dance of death, that the author
&s;ketched them while he was in England. They were, pro|bably,
in the Arundelian collection when Hollar engraved
them. He has fini&s;hed al&s;o a &s;et of prints from the &s;ine
paintings of the Du&s;&s;eldorf gallery, and likewi&s;e engravings
of the famous Hedlinger's medals. This able arti&s;t has a
&s;mall but well-cho&s;en collection of paintings: and his maga|zine
of prints (in which article he carries on a very con&s;ider|able
trade) is perhaps one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t complete
in Europe. I am acquainted with no per&s;on to whom the
curious traveller can addre&s;s him&s;elf with greater advantage
than to Mr. de Mechel, nor from whom he can receive more
u&s;eful information. To a particular knowledge of the phy|&s;ical
beauties of Switzerland, he joins a thorough acquaint|ance
with the different governments, cu&s;toms, and manners
of the &s;everal cantons. As he is intimately connected with
<PB N="128" REF="147">
the principal men of learning in this country, his letters of
recommendation are the mo&s;t de&s;irable, and the mo&s;t bene|ficial,
that can be procured: and he enjoys as much &s;atis|faction
in conferring, as can be received by accepting, his
good offices. He indeed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great fund of good|humour,
an amiable frankne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and a certain
originality of manner, which, together with his other va|luable
qualities, recommend him as a no le&s;s plea&s;ing than

<P>I VISITED al&s;o the &s;mall but plea&s;ing collection of pictures,
mo&s;tly of the Flemi&s;h and Dutch &s;chools, belonging to Mr.
Fac&s;ch, member of the Great Council. In the court-yard
before his hou&s;e is a wooden &s;tatue of Rhodolph I. &s;itting on
a throne, and clothed with the imperial in&s;ignia; under|neath
I ob&s;erved the date of 1273, the aera of that emperor's
coronation; and the rudene&s;s of the &s;culpture renders it pro|bable
that it is an original of that great emperor, who was
be&s;ieging Ba&s;le when he received the unexpected news of
his election. The gates were immediately thrown open;
and he was in&s;tantly admitted as a friend into that town,
which had &s;hut its gates again&s;t him as their enemy. On
this occa&s;ion he re&s;ided a &s;hort time at Ba&s;le, and, as tradi|tion
relates, in this very hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF BASLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE bi&s;hops of Ba&s;le once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;overeignty
over the city and canton; but were gradually de|prived
of their prerogatives; and, in 1501, finally quitted
this town, when the canton joined the Helvetic confederacy.
They at fir&s;t retired to Friburgh in Bri&s;gau, and afterwards,
e&s;tabli&s;hing their re&s;idence at Porentru, entirely lo&s;t the tri|fling
authority and incon&s;iderable prerogatives which re|mained
to them. Upon the introduction of the reforma|tion
in 1525, the con&s;titution was in &s;ome mea&s;ure changed;
and the power of the ari&s;tocracy limited.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem in theory &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to divide the
ari&s;tocratical and democratical commonwealths into &s;o many
different &s;pecies as exi&s;t in Switzerland: for, in this country,
every republic has its peculiar modification; and there is
none more &s;ingular than that of Ba&s;le. To view the general
outlines of the con&s;titution, it has the appearance of an ab|&s;olute
ari&s;tocracy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">An ari&s;tocracy (&s;trictly &s;peaking) means that form of government, which places the &s;upreme power in the nobles, exclu&s;ively of the people; but here I mean by it, the con&s;ining of the &s;overeign au|thority to a certain limited number of per|&s;ons, without con&s;idering whether they are particians or plebeians, nobles or commons: for at Ba&s;le every citizen who is noble, and who chu&s;es to retain his title of nobility, is incapable of being elected a member of the &s;overeign council.</NOTE>; but, upon con&s;idering it in detail, it will
be found to incline towards a democracy. The &s;upreme
<PB N="130" REF="149">
legi&s;lative power re&s;ides in the Great and Little Councils,
con&s;i&s;ting of about three hundred members: and the autho|rity
of the&s;e two councils combined, is without controul.
They enact laws, declare war and peace, contract alliances,
and impo&s;e taxes: they elect the &s;everal magi&s;trates, appoint
their own members, nominate to all employments, and con|fer
the right of burgher&s;hip. The general admini&s;tration of
government is committed by the Great Council to the Se|nate,
or Little Council; that is, to a part of its own body.
This Senate, compo&s;ed of &s;ixty members, together with the
four chiefs of the republic, two burgoma&s;ters, and two great
tribunes, is divided into two bodies, which act by rotation.
The acting divi&s;ion continues in office one year, decides
finally in all criminal cau&s;es, &s;uperintends the police, and ex|erci&s;es
&s;everal other powers &s;ubordinate to the Sovereign
Council. The collective body of citizens a&s;&s;embles only
once a year, when the magi&s;trates publicly take an oath to
maintain the con&s;titution, and pre&s;erve the liberties and im|munities
of the people, inviolate. The reciprocal oath of
obedience to the laws, is admini&s;tred to the citizens in their
re&s;pective tribes.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding the great and boundle&s;s preroga|tives
of the Great Council; yet the meane&s;t citizen is legally
capable of being admitted into that body; and, by the &s;in|gular
method of election, may po&s;&s;ibly be cho&s;en. For, the
vacancies in the councils are &s;upplied from all ranks of citi|zens,
one cla&s;s only excepted, the members of the univer|&s;ity.
The&s;e citizens are divided into eighteen tribes, called
in German <HI>Zuen&s;te;</HI> fifteen of which belong to the larger
<PB N="131" REF="150">
town, and three to the &s;maller: each of the fir&s;t-mentioned
fifteen tribes, returns four members to the Senate; and each
of the whole eighteen, &s;ends twelve to the Great Council.
Formerly the&s;e elections were determined by a plurality of
voices: but, as by the&s;e means the riche&s;t per&s;on was always
certain of being cho&s;en; a <HI>ternaire</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1718;
that is, three candidates were nominated, and from the&s;e the
&s;ucce&s;&s;or was appointed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The fifteen tribes in the great town are called <HI>Zuen&s;te,</HI> and the three in the &s;mall town <HI>Ge&s;ell&s;chaften,</HI> or companies. It may al&s;o be remarked, that the citizens of the &s;mall town enjoy more advantages than tho&s;e of the great town; ina&s;much as the former may be appointed to public employ|ments either in the tribes or in the com|panies; whereas a citizen of the great town cannot be admitted into the companies, unle&s;s he re&s;ides in the &s;mall town.</NOTE> by lot.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH this mode of election in &s;ome mea&s;ure put a
&s;top to corruption; yet it was not &s;ufficient to counteract
entirely the influence of the wealthy: and, as the poorer
citizens could &s;eldom &s;ucceed to the mo&s;t honourable or lu|crative
employments; they procured an act to be pa&s;&s;ed in
1740, changing the <HI>ternaire</HI> into a <HI>&s;enaire:</HI> by which &s;ix
candidates, in&s;tead of three, were put in nomination, and
drew lots for the charge. Six tickets, containing the names
of the re&s;pective candidates, and &s;eparately placed in &s;ilver
eggs, are in&s;erted into one bag; and the &s;ame number of
tickets, five of which are blanks, and one is marked with
the vacant employment, are placed in another. The reign|ing
burgoma&s;ter and the great tribune, appointed to be the
drawers of this <HI>official</HI> lottery, both at the &s;ame in&s;tant take
<PB N="132" REF="151">
a ticket from each bag; and the candidate who&s;e name
comes out at the &s;ame time with the ticket on which the
employment is written, obtains the po&s;t.</P>
<P>IT would be too tedious, and indeed too unintere&s;ting, a
detail, to enter into a minute account of the forms and cir|cum&s;tances
requi&s;ite to be ob&s;erved in &s;electing the &s;everal
candidates. To give, however, &s;ome general idea of this
matter:&mdash;Upon a vacancy in the Great Council, for in&s;tance,
the &s;ix candidates mu&s;t be taken from the citizens of that
tribe, to which the per&s;on who occa&s;ioned the vacancy be|longed;
and mu&s;t be nominated by &s;uch of the members of
the Great and Little Councils, as are of the &s;ame tribe. The
candidates for the &s;enate and for the tribunes or chiefs of
each tribe, called in German <HI>mei&s;ter,</HI> are appointed by the
Great Council. There is but one ca&s;e, in which the <HI>&s;enaire</HI>
is not practi&s;ed: for, upon the death of a burgoma&s;ter, his
colleague, who is the great tribune, &s;ucceeds of cour&s;e. It
&s;hould &s;eem, that many inconveniences mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily flow
from this ab&s;urd method of &s;upplying vacant po&s;ts in the
government; as they are left intirely to the capricious di&s;|po&s;al
of fortune. In fact, it has not unfrequently happened,
that a candidate, who&s;e knowledge and abilities rendered
him capable of being &s;erviceable to the &s;tate, has never ob|tained
the &s;ucce&s;sful ticket; while fortune has be&s;towed it
upon another by no means qualified to fulfil the duties of
the employment. However, notwith&s;tanding the ill effects
re&s;ulting from this ca&s;ual method of election; the manage|ment
of public affairs is in general tolerably well conducted;
<PB N="133" REF="152">
and there are few in&s;tances of civil ju&s;tice being unwi&s;ely
admini&s;tred, or of innocence being &s;acrificed to &s;uperior
wealth or power.</P>
<P>BUT the coun&s;ellors of &s;tate and the &s;everal magi&s;trates, are
not the only per&s;ons cho&s;en by lot; even the profe&s;&s;ors in the
univer&s;ity are elected in the &s;ame manner. The three can|didates
however, (for in this in&s;tance the <HI>ternaire</HI> is &s;till in
u&s;e) mu&s;t be nominated from tho&s;e who have taken the de|gree
of doctor. Hence nothing is more common than for a
candidate to offer him&s;elf for the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of a &s;cience,
which he has never made the peculiar object of his &s;tudies;
if the chair of that particular branch of literature in which
he excels is already occupied: for, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
the re&s;pective unqualifred profe&s;&s;ors change places
with each other. Thus (to mention an in&s;tance from a fa|mily
well known) John Bernoulli, the famous mathematical
profe&s;&s;or in this univer&s;ity, who died in 1748, left three &s;ons,
Nicholas, Daniel, and John, all ju&s;tly celebrated for their
&s;kill in that &s;cience, in which their father and uncle &s;o emi|nently
excelled. Nicholas died at St. Peter&s;burgh, member
of the Imperial Academy of Sciences; and Daniel, having fol|lowed
his brother into Ru&s;&s;ia, returned to Ba&s;le on obtaining
the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of anatomy, which he afterwards had an op|portunity
of happily exchanging for that of natural philo|&s;ophy,
and died in 1782. A &s;imilar circum&s;tance happened
to the third &s;on John: after being &s;everal times appointed
an un&s;ucce&s;sful candidate in the lottery of profe&s;&s;or&s;hips,
chance at length conferred on him the chair of <HI>rhetoric;</HI>
but, upon his father's death, he changed with Mr. Rum|&s;peck,
<PB N="134" REF="153">
to whom fortune, with her u&s;ual judgment, had
a&s;&s;igned the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of mathematics<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The following curious epitaph on a lawyer, interred in the cathedral, com|plains, that the decea&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding his advanced age of 84, which had afford|ed many opportunities of being nominated candidate for various offices of &s;tate, had been continually excluded by fortune.

<P>THE &s;umptuary laws are very &s;trict at Ba&s;le. The u&s;e
of coaches in the town is not indeed prohibited, as at Zuric;
but, what is more &s;ingular, no citizen or inhabitant is allow|ed
to have a &s;ervant behind his carriage. Laws of this kind
may be carried, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to a &s;crupulous and even
ridiculous minutene&s;s; upon the whole, however, they are
excellent regulations, and not only u&s;eful but nece&s;&s;ary in a
&s;mall republic. They have certainly operated with great
advantage in this town: for, although it contains &s;everal fa|milies
who are con&s;iderably rich; yet a happy &s;implicity of
manners is &s;till &s;o predominant, that you would &s;mile, if I
were to particulari&s;e tho&s;e articles which pa&s;s under the op|probrious
denomination of <HI>luxury.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="154">
THE lower rank of citizens are in general &s;o &s;trongly
prejudiced in favour of their own country, as to &s;eem con|vinced
that true felicity is only to be found at Ba&s;le: and
indeed that cla&s;s of people are in no part of the world more
happy. Every per&s;on boa&s;ts that he is free, and is &s;o in rea|lity:
and, as the citizens not only po&s;&s;e&s;s very con&s;iderable
privileges and immunities, but each individual may al&s;o
indulge the hope of being one day cho&s;en into the &s;overeign
council; he enjoys a certain degree of re&s;pect and con&s;idera|tion
extremely flattering to his &s;elf-importance. In fact,
there are &s;everal among the magi&s;trates who exerci&s;e the
meaner trades; and the pre&s;ent trea&s;urer, who&s;e name is
Muench, is a baker: he is indeed a per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed
knowledge and merit; and has been twice appointed one of
the candidates for the office of great tribune; which, if
fortune had favoured him, would have been followed, on
the next vacancy, by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the office of burgo|ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>IN general the burghers &s;ons receive an excellent edu|cation:
they always learn the Latin, and not unfre|quently
the Greek tongue; and it is by no means unu|&s;ual,
even for the lower &s;ort of trade&s;men, to employ
their lei&s;ure hours in the peru&s;al of Horace, Virgil, and
Plutarch.</P>
<P>THE conduct of magi&s;trates is no where more freely, nor
more &s;everely, critici&s;ed than at Ba&s;le. The people may
&s;ometimes, no doubt, extend this privilege beyond its proper
<PB N="136" REF="155">
limits; but they can never be totally re&s;trained from exer|ci&s;ing
it, without &s;triking at the vitals of their liberty: it is
e&s;&s;ential to its exi&s;tence, and no free government can long
&s;urvive its extinction.</P>
<P>BASLE is the large&s;t, and &s;eems formerly to have been
one of the mo&s;t populous, towns in Switzerland: its extent is
capable of containing above a hundred thou&s;and inhabi|tants;
whereas it can &s;carcely number more than fourteen
thou&s;and. Many particular cau&s;es may have concurred to
occa&s;ion this remarkable decrea&s;e of people; but I will men|tion
only one or two rea&s;ons to which it may be a&s;&s;igned.
It is proved, from undoubted calculations, that, in all great
cities, the number of burials exceeds that of births; con&s;e|quently,
unle&s;s this unequal proportion is compen&s;ated by a
con&s;tant acce&s;&s;ion of new inhabitants, in proce&s;s of time
every great town mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become depopulated. Now
the citizens of Ba&s;le are &s;o jealous of the burgher&s;hip, and
pride them&s;elves &s;o much upon the privileges which ac|company
it, that they &s;eldom deign to confer it upon fo|reigners:
a &s;upply therefore to balance that gradual wa&s;te
of people I have mentioned, can never be derived from
an influx of &s;trangers, where they are not permitted to
carry on commerce, or to follow any trade. A few years
ago, &s;ome of the magi&s;trates, &s;en&s;ible of the impolicy at|tending
this unlimited prohibition, procured a law, by
which the freedom of the town and the right of burgh|er&s;hip
was allowed to be conferred upon &s;trangers; but it
was clogged at the &s;ame time with &s;o many re&s;trictions, as
<PB N="137" REF="156">
by no means to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which it was in|tended.
Every principle, indeed, of private intere&s;t and
ambition, concurred to prevent its efficacy: and no won|der;
for, bodies of men are &s;eldom actuated by &s;o gene|rous
a &s;pirit as to &s;acrifice their per&s;onal and immediate
advantages, to the future welfare and pro&s;perity of their
country.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMBAT AT THE HOSPITAL OF ST. JAMES, BETWEEN
THE FORCES OF LOUIS DAUPHIN OF FRANCE, AND
A CORPS OF SWISS TROOPS&mdash;RUINS OF AUGST&mdash;
MULHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>CURIOSITY led me, during my continuance at Ba&s;le,
to vi&s;it the ho&s;pital and burying-ground of St. James,
not far from the town, and near the &s;mall river Birs, cele|brated
for a de&s;perate combat, in 1444, between the Swi&s;s
and the dauphin of France, afterwards Louis the Eleventh:
and never was Swi&s;s valour and intrepidity &s;o &s;ignally di&s;|played,
as by a few battalions of their troops on that me|morable
day.</P>
<P>THIS famous battle was fought in con&s;equence of &s;ome
di&s;putes, which aro&s;e between the canton of Zuric and tho&s;e
of Schweitz and Glarus. Zuric refu&s;ing to abide by the
mediation of the five neutral cantons, who had decided in
favour of Schweitz and Glarus, a civil war en&s;ued: upon
which occa&s;ion, Zuric formed an alliance with the emperor
Frederic the Third. The &s;even antient cantons, in order to
obtain a renunciation of this alliance, which they ju&s;tly con|&s;idered
as an infringement of their league, laid &s;iege to that
town. Frederic, unable to &s;end a &s;ufficient body of troops to
its relief, applied for additional &s;uccours to Charles the
Seventh, king of France; who, as well with a view of di&s;&s;olv|ing
<PB N="139" REF="158">
the council of Ba&s;le, as for the particular purpo&s;e re|quired,
ordered a con&s;iderable army to march, under the com|mand
of his &s;on Louis. Accordingly the dauphin entered
with his forces into Al&s;ace; and, after laying wa&s;te and hara&s;|&s;ing
the adjacent provinces, appeared before Ba&s;le. Upon
this occa&s;ion, a detachment of fifteen hundred Swi&s;s from
the army of the confederates (at that time employed in be|&s;ieging
Farn&s;purg) were ordered to throw them&s;elves into
the town of Ba&s;le, which was but &s;lightly garri&s;oned.</P>
<P>THIS handful of men advanced without interruption to
the plain of Brattelen; where they charged, with &s;uch de|termined
and well-conducted valour, eight thou&s;and of the
enemy's cavalry, that the latter were driven back as far as
Muttenz; at which place the repul&s;ed were joined by another
corps: but, notwith&s;tanding this reinforcement, the Swi&s;s
renewing the a&s;&s;ault with fre&s;h intrepidity, forced them to
repa&s;s the river Birs; where the main body of the army was
chiefly drawn up. Such was the firmne&s;s and &s;olidity of the
Swi&s;s in the&s;e &s;everal rencounters, that, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion
of an old French chronicle, when the cavalry charged
&startq;they could make no more impre&s;&s;ion, than if they had
attacked a rock, or an impenotrable wall.&endq; The Swi&s;s,
encouraged by this wonderful &s;ucce&s;s, and exa&s;perated with
the mo&s;t &s;pirited indignation again&s;t the invaders of their
country, di&s;regarded the remon&s;trances of their officers, and
ra&s;hly attempted to force their pa&s;&s;age over a bridge, which
was guarded by a large body of the enemy: but this effort of
incon&s;iderate valour proving ineffectual, the&s;e gallant &s;ol|diers,
throwing them&s;elves into the river, gained the oppo|&s;ite
<PB N="140" REF="159">
&s;hore, in the face of a battery of cannon that was play|ing
again&s;t them.</P>
<P>WHAT could the de&s;perate courage of &s;o &s;mall a number
avail, again&s;t an army of thirty thou&s;and men advantageou&s;ly
po&s;ted in an open plain? They had no alternative but either
to throw down their arms, or gloriou&s;ly expire. They
bravely preferred the latter: accordingly five hundred took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall i&s;land near the bridge, and, after re&s;o|lutely
defending them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity, were cut
to pieces. A like number forced their way through the
ranks of the enemy, and were making towards Ba&s;le; when
they were oppo&s;ed by a large body of hor&s;e, po&s;ted there to
prevent the inhabitants of the town from &s;allying to the re|lief
of their countrymen. Being now &s;urrounded on all
&s;ides, they threw them&s;elves into the ho&s;pital of St. James;
and, lining the walls of the burying-ground, re&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome
time the united a&s;&s;aults of the whole French army. At
length the ho&s;pital being &s;et on fire, and the cannon having
battered down the walls of the burying-ground, they fought
no longer in hopes of victory; but &s;till re&s;olving to &s;ell their
lives as dear as po&s;&s;ible, they continued to defend them&s;elves
to the la&s;t ga&s;p.</P>
<P>AENEAS SYLVIUS (afterwards pope Pius II.) relates, among
other actions of &s;ingular valour, exerted by this heroic troop,
a particular in&s;tance, which I cannot forbear mentioning.
Four French &s;oldiers a&s;&s;aulted a &s;ingle Swi&s;s, and having killed
and &s;tripped him, proceeded to in&s;ult the corp&s;e: one of
his companions, incen&s;ed at this brutal action, &s;eized a bat|tle-ax,
<PB N="141" REF="160">
ru&s;hed upon the four, &s;lew two of them, and drove
the others to flight; then flinging the dead body of his
friend upon his &s;houlders, carried it to a place of &s;ecurity;
and returning to the attack, fell by the hand of the enemy.
Of the whole number but &s;ixteen e&s;caped from the field of
battle; and the&s;e, agreeably to the old Spartan di&s;cipline,
were branded with infamy, for not having &s;acrificed their
lives in defence of their country. Among tho&s;e who were
de&s;perately wounded, and left upon the field of action, only
thirty-two were found alive. The names of many of the&s;e
glorious combatants were carefully regi&s;tered, and &s;till re|main
upon record.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the number of forces on both
&s;ides in this ever-memorable engagement. As far as we can
judge, by comparing the &s;everal relations of the French and
German hi&s;torians, the army of the dauphin con&s;i&s;ted of at
lea&s;t thirty thou&s;and. Charles and his &s;on Louis, in their
letters to the German princes on this occa&s;ion, a&s;&s;ert, that
three thou&s;and Swi&s;s fell on the field of battle; and perhaps
that account is not much exaggerated. With re&s;pect to the
&s;lain on the &s;ide of the dauphin, the amount is &s;till more
uncertain: his lo&s;s, however, mu&s;t have been very con&s;ide|rable,
for he remained three days upon the field of battle;
and, the better to conceal the number of the killed, he
ordered the dead bodies to be &s;ecretly interred in different
parts of the neighbourhood. Add to this, that he was ef|fectually
prevented from pro&s;ecuting his de&s;igns upon
Switzerland, and compelled to retire wich his &s;hattered army
into Al&s;ace. Louis him&s;elf, indeed, declared, that &s;uch
<PB N="142" REF="161">
another victory would ruin his army; and generou&s;ly con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that he derived from it no other advantage, than to
know and e&s;teem the valour of the Swi&s;s. Accordingly,
this combat may be con&s;idered as forming a remarkable aera
in the hi&s;tory of the Swi&s;s: for, it gave ri&s;e to their treaty
with Charles the Seventh, the fir&s;t alliance which they con|tracted
with France.</P>
<P>THE war, however, between the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and
Zuric on one &s;ide, and the &s;even cantons on the other, con|tinued
until the year 1446, when a peace was concluded by
the mediation and deci&s;ion of certain arbiters: Zuric re|nounced
its connection with the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and the
Helvetic Confederacy was again &s;olemnly renewed and con|firmed
between the eight cantons. Upon this occa&s;ion, two
very important articles in the public law of Switzerland,
were finally &s;ettled: Fir&s;t, that all di&s;putes between any par|ticular
cantons, &s;hould be decided by the mediation of the
neutral cantons; and if either of the two contending parties
&s;hould decline to acquie&s;ce under their judgment, the neu|tral
cantons are empowered to have recour&s;e to arms, in
order to compel the recu&s;ant to abide by their determina|tion:
Secondly, notwith&s;tanding the right which either of
the cantons might have re&s;erved to it&s;elf, of contracting alli|ances
with foreign powers, yet the other confederates are to
judge, whether &s;uch alliance is contradictory to, or incom|patible
with, the articles of the general union; and if it
&s;hould appear to be &s;o, it is declared utterly null and void.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="162">
THE Swi&s;s &s;till talk of this famous action with the
warme&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m. Accordingly, the inhabitants of Ba&s;le
form parties every year, to an inn &s;ituated near the ho&s;pital
and burying-ground of St. James, in order to commemorate,
in a red wine produced from &s;ome vineyards planted on the
field of battle, the heroic deeds of their brave countrymen,
who &s;o gloriou&s;ly &s;acrificed their lives upon the occa&s;ion.
This wine, which they called the &startq;<HI>Blood of the Swi&s;s,</HI>&endq; is
highly prized by the Ba&s;ileans, though it has little to re|commend
it in point of flavour; neverthele&s;s, I am much
mi&s;taken, if that famous line of Horace,
<Q>Non mi&s;&s;ura cutem ni&s;i <HI>plena</HI> cruoris,</Q>
was more applicable to the teazing poet he mentions, than
it is to tho&s;e jovial patriotic parties, at the anniver&s;ary com|potations
of the &startq;<HI>Blood of the Swi&s;s.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>NEAR Ba&s;le are the ruins of <HI>Augu&s;ta Rauricorum,</HI> for|merly
a large town under the dominion of the Romans, now
a &s;mall village in the canton of Ba&s;le, clo&s;e to the Rhine.
Its antient remains are very incon&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ting of a
few columns of marble, &s;till &s;tanding, and &s;ome &s;cattered
fragments of pillars, together with a &s;emicircular range of
walls upon a ri&s;ing ground, the greate&s;t part of which has
fallen, and is almo&s;t entirely overgrown with underwood.
From the pre&s;ent appearance of the&s;e ruins, I &s;hould hardly
have conjectured that they once compo&s;ed part of a theatre,
capable of containing above twelve thou&s;and &s;pectators.
But the celebrated Schaefflin has given, in his <HI>Al&s;atia Illu|&s;trata,</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="163">
a particular de&s;cription of this theatre, and of the
temple, to which the marble columns formerly belonged.
I noticed al&s;o the remains of &s;ome &s;mall aqueducts, which
conveyed water to the town from the di&s;tance of above
twelve miles: but none of the&s;e antient relics are &s;ufficiently
remarkable to merit the trouble of a particular vi&s;it.</P>
<P>THE pea&s;ants, in turning up the ground where the&s;e
ruins are &s;ituated, frequently find medals of the Roman em|perors,
from Augu&s;tus to Con&s;tantine; and are become, by
repeated experience, able to di&s;tingui&s;h, with &s;ome degree of
preci&s;ion, tho&s;e that are rare from the more common coins.
I purcha&s;ed of a labourer two medals, which he had ju&s;t
found; a Trajan and an Albinus: and though the former
was by far the mo&s;t perfect, yet he exacted three times as
much for the latter, becau&s;e he had never &s;een it, he &s;aid,
before.</P>
<P>FROM Ba&s;le I made an excur&s;ion to Mulhau&s;en, a town
in alliance with the Swi&s;s cantons; which, though &s;ituated
at the di&s;tance of &s;everal miles from the frontiers of Switzer|land,
and entirely enclo&s;ed within the dominions of France,
is yet con&s;idered and re&s;pected as a part of the Helvetic Con|federacy;
and entitled to all the privileges enjoyed by that
body.</P>
<P>MULHAUSEN &s;tands in Sundgau, a di&s;trict of Al&s;ace,
about fifteen miles from Ba&s;le; in a fertile plain, at the
bottom of a ridge of hills, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the
Voges. The walls of the town enclo&s;e a circumference of
<PB N="145" REF="164">
not more than two miles, and its whole territory is com|pri&s;ed
within a precinct of eight miles. This little republic
maintained its privileges, which had been granted by the
emperors, during the times of feudal tyranny, by contracting
an alliance, at different intervals, with Ba&s;le, Stra&s;burgh, and
the towns of Al&s;ace and Suabia; and afterwards, in the
middle of the fifteenth century, with Berne, Friburgh, and
Soleure. At length, in 1515, it was received into the Hel|vetic
Confederacy; which league has pre&s;erved its liberty
and independence from the encroachments of the empire,
on one hand, and, on the other, from the attacks of France.
The inhabitants are of the Reformed religion. The town
contains about eight hundred hou&s;es, and &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls,
and there are two thou&s;and &s;ubjects in the villages within
its little territory. Mulhau&s;en owes its pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing
&s;tate, to its manufactures, which con&s;i&s;t principally of
printed linens and cottons. The government is ari&s;to-demo|cratical.
The &s;upreme power re&s;ides in the Great and
Little Councils, con&s;i&s;ting both together of &s;eventy-eight
per&s;ons, and drawn from the burghers, who&s;e number
amounts to &s;even hundred, di&s;tributed into &s;ix tribes.</P>
<P>Mr. Koehlin's commercial &s;chool de&s;erves to be mention|ed.
It is a private in&s;titution for about thirty &s;cholars, who
are in&s;tructed in the German, French, and Latin languages;
in fencing, dancing, and all polite accompli&s;hments; and
more particularly in accounts and book-keeping. The ex|pence,
including an uniform, amounts to &pound;. 50 <HI>per annum.</HI>
The plan is very judicious, and the whole appeared to me to
be well conducted.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH the greate&s;t part of the dominions
&s;ubject to the Bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le, or as he is called by
the Prote&s;tants, the Prince of Porentru, is not compri&s;ed
within the limits of Switzerland; yet as, till lately, he was
in alliance with the Catholic cantons, and as many of his
&s;ubjects, even in tho&s;e di&s;tricts which lie within the German
empire, are comburghers with Berne, and under the pro|tection
of that republic, his territory is u&s;ually included in
all the topographical accounts of Switzerland. It merits al&s;o
the notice of the traveller for its romantic &s;cenes, of the
mineralogi&s;t for the variety of its petrifactions and fo&s;&s;ils,
and of the politician for the peculiarity of its government,
and the numerous and complicated immunities of the
people.</P>
<P>HAVING made various excur&s;ions into this country, I
&s;hall lay before you a general account of its political &s;tate,
and a particular de&s;cription of tho&s;e parts which I had an
opportunity of vi&s;iting.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="166">
THE bi&s;hopric of Ba&s;le may be cla&s;&s;ed under two general
divi&s;ions: the fir&s;t lies to the &s;outh of Pierre Pertuis, and
forms a part of Switzerland; the &s;econd, to the north of the
&s;ame boundary, includes that di&s;trict &s;ituated within the
German empire.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign of this country is cho&s;en by the chapter
of eighteen canons, re&s;ident at Arle&s;heim, and confirmed by
the pope. He is prince of the German empire; and does
homage to the emperor for that part of his territory which
lies in the Circle of the Upper Rhine. He was always con|&s;idered
as an ally of the Swi&s;s, by his union with the Catho|lic
cantons, fir&s;t formed in 1579, and renewed at different
intervals, particularly in 1671 and 1697; and by being in|cluded
in the treaty which tho&s;e cantons contracted with
France in 1715. But as he was not compri&s;ed among the
allies of the Swi&s;s, in the league between the thirteen can|tons
and Louis the Sixteenth, in 1777, he can at pre&s;ent
&s;carcely be e&s;teemed a member of the Helvetic Confederacy.
The fir&s;t particular alliance with France was concluded in
1739, between the bi&s;hop and Louis the Fifteenth; and
was renewed in 1780. By virtue of this treaty the bi&s;hop
has troops in the French &s;ervice; and his &s;ubjects enjoy all
the privileges which are granted to the natives of the thir|teen
cantons. In ca&s;e of a rupture between France and the
Empire, he is bound to remain neuter. But this neutrallity
did not, in 1675, prevent the French troops from being
quartered in his dominions, as forming part of the empire;
and they were only removed at the interce&s;&s;ion of the Ca|tholic
cantons. If a mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;hould ari&s;e between
France and the Emperor, the bi&s;hop's &s;ituation would be ex|tremely
<PB N="148" REF="167">
embarra&s;&s;ing; as his doubtful connection with the
Swi&s;s would &s;carcely pre&s;erve his territory from being in|vaded
by one of tho&s;e two powers.</P>
<P>THE form of government is a limited &s;overeignty: the
bi&s;hop being bound, on all important occa&s;ions, to con&s;ult
his chapter; and his prerogative being confined by the
great immunities enjoyed by his &s;ubjects in general, and
particularly by tho&s;e of the Reformed communion. He no|minates
to all employments, both civil and military, and
appoints the bailifs or governors; penal ju&s;tice is admini|&s;tered
in his name; and he has the power of pardoning cri|minals.
In civil proceedings, he receives an appeal from
the inferior courts; but in his German dominions, when the
cau&s;e exceeds the value of a &s;tipulated &s;um, it may be car|ried
to the chambers of Wetzlar or Vienna. The &s;ubjects of
the bi&s;hop are partly Prote&s;tants and partly Catholics. The
Prote&s;tants, of whom a more particular account will be
given, inhabit the greate&s;t part of the valley of Mun&s;ter,
and the whole di&s;trict to the &s;outh of Pierre Pertuis, and are
about 15,000; the Catholics amount to 35,000.</P>
<P>THE French and German languages being both &s;poken
in the bi&s;hop's dominions, &s;everal places have two names,
that &s;carcely re&s;emble each other; namely, <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and
<HI>Moitier, Dachfeld</HI> and <HI>Tavannes, Delmont</HI> and <HI>Del&s;berg, Cor|randelin</HI>
and <HI>Rennendor&s;, Elay</HI> and <HI>Seehof.</HI></P>
<P>PORENTRU, capital of the bi&s;hop's dominions, and his
principal re&s;idence, is &s;ituated in the bailliage of El&s;gau,
about three miles from the frontiers of France. It is a
<PB N="149" REF="168">
&s;mall but neat town; and its po&s;ition, in an oval plain, &s;ur|rounded
by well-wooded hills, and watered by a &s;erpentine
rivulet, is exceedingly plea&s;ant. The epi&s;copal palace, which
has been lately repaired and augmented, &s;tands on an emi|nence
overlooking the town, and the environs fertile in
corn and pa&s;ture. One of the towers, built of &s;tone, and
&s;aid to be of Roman workman&s;hip, &s;till remains a monu|ment
of its antiquity.</P>
<P>THE high roads, which lead from all quarters to Poren|tru,
and have been formed at a con&s;iderable expence, do
honour to the &s;overeigns of this country. The way to Bel|lelay
and Bienne, is a magnificent cau&s;eway: it traver&s;es a
mountainous di&s;trict; is carried over hanging terraces;
through &startq;twilight groves,&endq; and along continued acclivities
and declivities. I pur&s;ued the latter part by moonlight;
and the reflection of the rays quivering through the thick
foliage was inconceivably beautiful. Bellelay, which I
vi&s;ited in my journey from Bienne to Porentru, is a rich
abbey of Benedictines, about twenty miles from the capital,
in a &s;olitary but not unplea&s;ant &s;ituation, &s;urrounded by
mountains, and &s;heltered by fore&s;ts. This abbey is not
merely confined to religious purpo&s;es; the late abbot,
Nicholas de Luce, having in&s;tituted a military academy for
the young nobility and gentry. For this purpo&s;e he erected
a large building near the abbey, and provided &s;uitable
ma&s;ters and profe&s;&s;ors. When I was at Bellelay, the number
of &s;cholars amounted to forty. They are in&s;tructed in
various branches of polite literature; they wear uniforms;
and are trained to military manoeuvres and exerci&s;es. The
<PB N="150" REF="169">
cheapne&s;s of this &s;chool, and its di&s;tance from the di&s;&s;i|pation
of large towns, renders it of great public utility.
The whole expence of each &s;cholar, for his board, lodging,
in&s;truction, and various le&s;&s;ons, &s;carcely exceeds &pound;. 20 <HI>per
annum.</HI> It is curious to find a military academy e&s;tabli&s;hed
in the mid&s;t of rocks and fore&s;ts, and within the walls of a
convent; and to ob&s;erve Benedictine friars, in&s;tead of wa&s;t|ing
their time in monki&s;h ignorance and &s;uper&s;itition, ren|dering
them&s;elves beneficial to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE chapter, compo&s;ed of eighteen canons, who, upon a
vacancy in the &s;ee, po&s;&s;e&s;s the right of electing the bi&s;hop,
was fixed at Friburgh in Bri&s;gau from the period of the re|formation,
which drove them from Ba&s;le, to 1677, when
Friburgh was occupied by the French troops. In the fol|lowing
year the chapter was transferred to Arle&s;heim,
where it now re&s;ides. The vacant canonries are filled al|ternately
by the pope and chapter.</P>
<P>ON the 14th of Augu&s;t 1786, I made an excur&s;ion, in
company with &s;everal friends, to Arle&s;heim, which is a &s;mall
but agreeably &s;ituated place, almo&s;t four miles from Ba&s;le.
We had the honour of dining with the Baron de Ligertz,
one of the canons. After a repa&s;t, no le&s;s elegant than agree|able,
our ho&s;t politely accompanied us to a garden &s;tyled
The Hermitage, about a quarter of a mile from Arle&s;heim;
which was laid out at the joint expence of the baron and of
Madame d'Andlau, the bailif's lady, with a view to employ
the poor in a time of great &s;carcity, and to provide walks for
the inhabitants of the town. The grounds are very exten|&s;ive;
<PB N="151" REF="170">
and plea&s;ant. The walks are carried along the &s;ides
of the rocks, which are richly wooded, and through a de|lightful
&s;emicircular plain, bounded by fertile hills, and wa|tered
by a &s;mall lake, the borders of which are peculiarly
wild and picture&s;que. Several caverns, hollowed and arched
by the hand of nature, add to the romantic &s;ingularity of the
&s;cenery; while many tran&s;parent &s;treams, conveyed from a
con&s;iderable di&s;tance, fall in &s;mall ca&s;cades, or bubble from
the ground like real &s;prings. A fa&s;tidious ob&s;erver might
perhaps remark of this enchanting &s;pot, that in a few cir|cum&s;tances
nature has been too much &s;acrificed to art; and
that there are &s;ome buildings le&s;s calculated to plea&s;e than to
&s;urpri&s;e. The following elegant in&s;cription for this charm|ing
hermitage was extemporarily compo&s;ed by profe&s;&s;or
Oberlin of Stra&s;burgh, one of our party.</P>

<P>I SHALL clo&s;e this letter with an account of my journey
from Ba&s;le to Bienne, through the vallies of Lauffen, Del|mont,
Mun&s;ter, and St. Imier, a tract of country in the
bi&s;hopric of Ba&s;le, which is not inferior in beauty to the
mo&s;t delightful parts of Switzerland.</P>
<P>WE quitted Ba&s;le early in the morning; and pa&s;&s;ed
through a fertile plain watered by the Birs, and bounded by
<PB N="152" REF="171">
two chains of the Jura; one whereof terminates abruptly,
&s;upporting on its &s;ummit the ca&s;tle of Wertenburgh. As
we continued our route, the plain gradually narrowed; the
mountains approached each other; and we entered the rich
valley of Lauffen, enclo&s;ed between the rocks, &s;prinkled
with groves of oak and beech, exhibiting many romantic
points of view. Lauffen, which gives name to the valley,
has its own magi&s;trates, and inferior courts of ju&s;tice. The
natives are indu&s;trious: tho&s;e who are not employed in agri|culture,
gain a comfortable livelihood from making cloth,
&s;pinning yarn, and knitting wor&s;ted &s;tockings. The inhabi|tants
of the valley talk German, and tho&s;e of Sautier, a &s;mall
neighbouring village, French, which language is &s;poken
through the vallies of Delmont, Mun&s;ter, and St. Imier.
About three leagues from Lauffen we came to a narrow pa&s;s,
entered the valley of Delmont, near Sautier; quitted the
high road, and gently a&s;cended to Delmont, which &s;tands
plea&s;antly on an acclivity, backed by a ridge of rocks em|browned
with firs.</P>
<P>IN this &s;mall town re&s;ide the provo&s;t and canons, who
compo&s;e the chapter formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed at Mun&s;ter;
which was removed here, in 1630, on the introduction of the
Reformed religion in the valley of Mun&s;ter. At the extre|mity
of the town is the epi&s;copal palace, built in 1718, by
Conrad Baron of Reinach, and bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le: it com|mands
a &s;ine view of the adjacent country. The bailif, who
holds his court in this town, has juri&s;diction over the valleys
of Delmont and Mun&s;ter. In criminal proceedings he ar|re&s;ts
and examines; and can inflict &s;mall penalties for tri|fling
mi&s;demeanors; but in all ca&s;es of notoriety, the delin|quent
<PB N="153" REF="172">
is either tried at Porentru, or the bailif's &s;entence mu&s;t
be confirmed or amended in that &s;upreme tribunal. Civil
cau&s;es are fir&s;t adjudged in the provincial courts; from
who&s;e deci&s;ion an appeal lies to the epi&s;copal tribunal at
Porentru; and from thence to the imperial chambers of
Wetzlar or Vienna. Delmont contains eight hundred inha|bitants,
who are all Catholics: they have their own magi&s;|trates
and inferior tribunals.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile from Delmont I &s;topped at Corrandelin, a
&s;mall village in the Catholic di&s;trict of the valley of Mun&s;ter,
in order to examine an iron foundery belonging to the
bi&s;hop. The ore is drawn from the valley of Delmont, near
the villages of Corou, Wick, Recolens, and Sepres; it is
taken from the ground in &s;mall pieces, &s;eldom larger than
the &s;ize of a pea. The director informed me that it is
u&s;ually found in that &s;tate, and very rarely in ma&s;&s;es. The
large&s;t he ever remembered to have &s;een, was ten feet long,
two thick, and two broad. He added, that the mountains in
the neighbourhood abound with ore, which would yield
con&s;iderable quantities of iron, if &s;ufficient charcoal could be
procured for the &s;melting furnaces. As he was but lately
appointed director, he could not give any accurate intelli|gence
concerning the annual quantity of iron &s;melted in
this foundery; but informed me, in general, that the differ|ent
ores yielded altogether two thirds of pure mineral, the
quality whereof was extremely &s;ine, and &s;carcely inferior to
the be&s;t iron exported from Sweden.</P>
<P>CORRANDELIN, together with the villages of Chatillon,
Ro&s;&s;emai&s;on, Vellerat, Courchappois, Corbaon, Mervellier,
<PB N="154" REF="173">
and Elay, though connected as to eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs with
the valley of Delmont, form that part of the valley of Mun|&s;ter,
which is called the <HI>Catholic,</HI> or <HI>Lower</HI> Di&s;trict. It is de|nominated
the <HI>Catholic</HI> Di&s;trict, becau&s;e the inhabitants are
exclu&s;ively of the Romi&s;h church; and <HI>Lower</HI> Di&s;trict, be|cau&s;e
it is &s;ituated <HI>unter den fel&s;en,</HI> or <HI>below</HI> the ridge of
rocks which &s;eparate it from the <HI>Upper,</HI> or <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Di&s;|trict.
But before I proceed further, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to
de&s;cribe the general divi&s;ions of this valley, and the civil and
religious immunities of the natives, that you may be enabled
to comprehend its complicated topography, and its curious
political &s;tate, by which, though &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of
Ba&s;le, it is under the protection of the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>THE valley of Mun&s;ter, or Moitier, extends from the
valley of Delmont to Pierre Pertuis; and is included in that
part of the bi&s;hop's dominions which lie within the Ger|man
empire. But, as the inhabitants have, for above three
hundred years, been in alliance with Berne, and under the
protection of that republic, the valley is con&s;idered by many
authors as forming part of Switzerland. It is divided into
two principal di&s;tricts; the <HI>Catholic</HI> or <HI>Lower</HI> Di&s;trict, which
lies at the extremity of the valley of Delmont, and compri&s;es
the eight villages above-mentioned; the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> or <HI>Upper</HI>
Di&s;trict, which &s;tretches from the chain of rocks near Cor|randelin,
to Pierre Pertuis, its &s;outhern boundary; and con|taining,
1. The Greater Valley, or Valley of Tavannes;
and 2. The Le&s;&s;er Valley, which is &s;ubdivided into Grand-Val,
or the Great-Valley, and the Little Valley, or the Valley
of Sornetan.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="174">
THE inhabitants of both di&s;tricts are comburghers with
the canton of Berne. The fir&s;t treaty of comburgher&s;hip was
contracted in 1484. In that year, Berne and the bi&s;hop of
Ba&s;le re&s;pectively &s;upporting two candidates for the provo&s;t|&s;hip
of Mun&s;ter; the former marched an army into the&s;e
parts, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole valley, and exacted ho|mage
from the inhabitants. The&s;e di&s;putes being compro|mi&s;ed
at the treaty of Corrandelin, Berne re&s;tored the valley
to the bi&s;hop on the following conditions: that the inha|bitants
&s;hould be maintained in all their privileges; con|tinue
as comburghers with Berne, under the protection
of that republic; remain neuter in ca&s;e of a war be|tween
Berne and the bi&s;hop; and follow the &s;tandard of
Berne, when the latter was engaged in ho&s;tilities again&s;t any
other power. This treaty of comburgher&s;hip, renewed at
different intervals, has excited frequent di&s;putes between
Berne and the bi&s;hop, and particularly in 1705 and 1711 oc|ca&s;ioned
an open rupture. The&s;e di&s;putes were finally ad|ju&s;ted
at the pacification of Arau; when the bi&s;hop ratified
the treaty of comburgher&s;hip, confirmed all the rights and
immunities of the inhabitants, and con&s;ented to the media|tion
and interference of Berne.</P>
<P>THE affairs of religion excited for &s;ome time no le&s;s con|te&s;t
between the bi&s;hop and Berne than the treaty of com|burgher&s;hip.
The reformation being adopted, in 1531, by a
con&s;iderable number of the inhabitants in the valley of Mun|&s;ter,
civil commotions en&s;ued; Berne inter&s;ered in behalf of
the Prote&s;tants, and the bi&s;hop protected the antient church
<PB N="156" REF="175">
e&s;tabli&s;hment. It was at length, amicably &s;ettled between
both parties; that the majority of each pari&s;h &s;hould
freely decide, whether the inhabitants &s;hould profe&s;s the
Roman Catholic or the Reformed religion; and that the
chapter of Mun&s;ter &s;hould continue to receive the tythes, on
condition of di&s;charging the &s;alaries of the Prote&s;tant mini&s;|ters.
In con&s;equence of this rational compromi&s;e, the eight
villages, which now form the <HI>Lower</HI> di&s;trict, voted for the
maintenance of the Catholic religion; and the pari&s;hes of
the Upper di&s;trict for the Reformed church. Accordingly
the two per&s;ua&s;ions were re&s;pectively e&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e
two di&s;tricts; the chapter retained its e&s;tates and tythes, but
quitting Mun&s;ter, where the new doctrines were admitted,
retired fir&s;t to Soleure, and afterwards &s;ettled at Delmont:
but, as &s;everal Prote&s;tants and Catholics continued promi&s;|cuou&s;ly
to inhabit the two di&s;tricts, di&s;turbances were occa|&s;ionally
renewed. Nor were the religious differences en|tirely
compo&s;ed till the peace of Arau; which enjoined, that
all the members of the two per&s;ua&s;ions &s;hould be finally &s;e|parated;
that all the inhabitants of the <HI>Upper</HI> di&s;trict, who
then profe&s;&s;ed or &s;hould hereafter profe&s;s the Catholic reli|gion,
&s;hould retire to Elay; and that in the &s;ame manner
the Prote&s;tants in the <HI>Lower</HI> di&s;trict &s;hould remove to the
<HI>Upper</HI> di&s;trict. Since this period, the mo&s;t perfect harmony
has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them.</P>
<P>BY virtue of the alliance with Berne, that republic an|nually
deputes one of its magi&s;trates to this valley, for the
purpo&s;e of inquiring if the civil and religious immunities
<PB REF="176">

<PB N="157" REF="177">
have been pre&s;erved inviolate; and an eccle&s;ia&s;tic: the latter,
called in&s;pector of the churches in the valley of Mun&s;ter, ex|amines
into the &s;tate of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline; and di&s;tri|butes
among the inhabitants of the <HI>Upper</HI> di&s;trict catechi&s;ms
and p&s;alters. Berne al&s;o approves the nomination of the
mini&s;ters to the vacant benefices, &s;ome of whom are ap|pointed
and paid by the bi&s;hop, others by the chapters of
Delmont and Bellelay; as the bi&s;hop or chapters po&s;&s;e&s;s the
tythes in the re&s;pective pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>BUT to return from this digre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Soon after quitting
Corrandelin, I entered the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> di&s;trict, through a pa&s;s
between two rocks, which nearly approach each other, and
ju&s;t leave an opening &s;ufficient for the Birs and the road.
This pa&s;s leads into a narrow glen, about four miles in
length, and in many places almo&s;t re&s;embling a &s;ubterrane|ous
aby&s;s. The road winds by the &s;ide of the impetuous Birs,
and at the bottom of two ranges of rocks: the&s;e rocks are of
white lime&s;tone, of inacce&s;&s;ible height; and though in mo&s;t
places ab&s;olutely perpendicular, yet are agreeably feathered
with trees, and particularly towards their &s;ummits, which
overhang, and &s;carcely admit the light of the &s;un. In the
mid&s;t of this glen is La Roche, the fir&s;t Prote&s;tant village in
the valley of Mun&s;ter; the hou&s;es whereof &s;tand on both &s;ides
of the Birs, where the rocks recede a little, and pre&s;ent a
gentle &s;lope. On i&s;&s;uing from this glen, we entered a fertile
plain encircled by hills, in the mid&s;t of which is &s;ituated the
village of Mun&s;ter or Moitier: it takes that appellation from
the chapter of canons, who upon the reformation, quitted
<PB N="158" REF="178">
this place of their re&s;idence and &s;ettled them&s;elves at
Delmont.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a mile from Mun&s;ter we came into another
glen, near three miles in length: it is called <HI>Chaluet,</HI> of a
&s;imilar nature with that which we traver&s;ed between Cor|randelin
and the plain of Mun&s;ter, but &s;till wilder and more
craggy, deeper and more ob&s;cure. It is al&s;o divided by the
Birs, which ru&s;hes through it with great impetuo&s;ity; and is
&s;o narrow, that the road occupies the whole &s;pace between
the torrent and the mountain, and the wheels of our car|riage
frequently on one &s;ide bru&s;hed the rock, and on the
other ran clo&s;e to the precipice which overhangs the river.
This cau&s;eway, over broken crags and &s;teep precipices, does
honour to the prince who carried it into execution. The
following in&s;cription, which I ob&s;erved near a bridge in the
mid&s;t of this ob&s;cure glen, may perhaps &s;eem exaggerated,
to a per&s;on unacquainted with the natural impediments of
the country; but to me, on the &s;pot, appeared &s;trictly con&s;o|nant
to truth.</P>

ALTHOUGH in various parts of Switzerland I had fre|quently
ob&s;erved the ju&s;tne&s;s of the remark, that in all deep
vallies which inter&s;ect the mountains, the &s;alient angles on
one &s;ide alternately corre&s;pond with the cavities on the
other; and that parallel &s;trata of rock an&s;wer to each other,
in all directions and at all heights; yet I never &s;aw this fact
more &s;trongly exemplified than in the two ridges of lime|&s;tone
that border this glen. They are of a &s;tupendous
height; and the &s;trata horizontal, inclined, or almo&s;t per|pendicular
on one &s;ide, are exactly &s;imilar and of the &s;ame
thickne&s;s on the other: a circum&s;tance, which, joined to the
corre&s;ponding &s;ituation of the angles, &s;eems to prove, that
they were formerly united, and have been either rent a&s;un|der
by &s;ome &s;udden convul&s;ion, or &s;eparated by the gradual
attrition of the waters. At the extremity of the Chaluet we
entered another plain, well cultivated, and agreeably &s;potted
with villages; and arrived towards the clo&s;e of the evening
at Molleray, where we pa&s;&s;ed the night. The people in the&s;e
parts appear happy and contented, and are extremely indu&s;|trious.
The greate&s;t part are employed in agriculture; a
few, encouraged by their neighbours of Locle and Chaux de
Fond, have lately introduced &s;everal trades into the&s;e moun|tains;
and Belleval, a &s;mall neighbouring village, already
contains five watchmakers.</P>
<P>FROM Molleray we continued along a fertile plain by the
&s;ide of the Birs; through &s;everal plea&s;ant and well-looking
villages, of which Tavannes, in German <HI>Dach&s;eld,</HI> is the
large&s;t. In about two miles we arrived at the extremity of
the plain, which is clo&s;ed by a rock, through which opens
<PB N="160" REF="180">
the celebrated pa&s;s called <HI>Pierre Pertuis.</HI> At the bottom of
this rock, the Birs bur&s;ts from the ground in &s;everal copious
&s;prings, and turns two mills within a few paces of its princi|pal
&s;ource.</P>
<P><HI>Pierre Pertuis</HI> is a large arched aperture through a &s;olid
rock, about thirty feet long, forty-five broad, and thirty
high in the lowe&s;t part, which &s;ome aver to have been
formed by nature, others by art. A Roman in&s;cription over
the arch, extremely defaced, has given &s;ufficient employ|ment
to the ingenuity of antiquaries. Having &s;een &s;everal
fac-&s;imiles, greatly differing from each other, I copied it as
exactly as the height would permit.</P>

from this reading, that the rock was pierced by order of Pa|ternus;
but merely that the road was carried through the
rock<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The reader, who wi&s;hes to examine this &s;ubject with attention, is referred to Schaefflin's <HI>Al&s;atia Illu&s;trata,</HI> and to a di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;ubject publi&s;hed by Buxtorf.</NOTE>. Not to detain you, however, with fanciful con|jectures,
I &s;hall only add, that on examining the in&s;cription
with attention, the words which antiquarians have &s;upplied,
to &s;upport their particular &s;y&s;tems, are extremely doubtful;
and that to me, who ob&s;erved the arch without partiality or
prejudice in favour of any hypothe&s;is, it appeared to have
been originally a great cavern, either totally formed by
nature, or if a&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, that only a &s;mall part of its
&s;outhern extremity was opened by the labour of man.</P>
<P>THE &s;outhern extremity of <HI>Pierre Pertuis</HI> leads into the
valley of St. Imier, &s;ometimes called Enguel, which com|pri&s;es
the bi&s;hop's dominions lying in Switzerland. The in|habitants
are Prote&s;tants, and governed by a bailif appointed
by the bi&s;hop. He re&s;ides at Courtelari; but his authority
is exceedingly limited by the various privileges, both civil
and religious, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the natives. Their religious im|munities
confirmed by the bi&s;hop, are guarantied by the
four Reformed cantons. The whole di&s;trict lies within the
Jura mountains; and is fertile in pa&s;ture. The inhabi|tants
are indu&s;trious. On arriving on the extremity of
<PB N="162" REF="183">
mount Jura, a glorious pro&s;pect bur&s;ts upon the view, com|manding
the undulating country fertili&s;ed by the Aar,
backed by the maje&s;tic chain of Alps extending beyond the
frontiers of Savoy. De&s;cending gently into the plain with
this glorious pro&s;pect before us, and which was heightened
by the luminous &s;plendour of the mid-day &s;un, we cro&s;&s;ed
the Sure, and fini&s;hed our delightful expedition at Bienne.
From Pierre Pertuis to Bienne, a &s;uperb cau&s;eway is carried
along a continual de&s;cent for about &s;ix miles; it winds
through thick fore&s;ts, and over-hangs the deep aby&s;s, in
which the Sure, a turbid and impetuous torrent, precipi|tates
its cour&s;e, always roaring, and frequently un&s;een, in its
rocky channel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 19.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN OF BIENNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;mall territory of Bienne, containing &s;carcely &s;ix
thou&s;and inhabitants, lies between the lake and a
chain of the Jura mountains: it is &s;urrounded by the
cantons of Berne and Soleure, the bi&s;hopric of Ba&s;le, and
the principality of Neuchatel. The town is &s;ituated at the
foot of the Jura, and at a little di&s;tance from the lake; which
is here about nine miles in length, and four in breadth:
the borders are plea&s;ing and picture&s;que; and the town
of Nidau forms a very beautiful object upon its ea&s;tern
&s;ide.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le is the &s;overeign of this little &s;tate: his
power, formerly con&s;iderable, is at pre&s;ent exceedingly li|mited.
Indeed the con&s;titution of Bienne is of &s;o very peculiar
a nature, that I know not well by what name it can be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed:
it cannot properly be called either a limited mo|narchy,
or an independent republic; but &s;eems rather to be
a mixed government, partaking &s;omewhat of both. The
bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le receives, upon his promotion to the &s;ee,
the homage of the citizens and militia of this town, with all
the apparent ceremonials of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion;
but at the &s;ame time, he confirms, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner,
all their privileges and franchi&s;es. He is repre&s;ented by a
mayor of his own appointing, who&s;e power and office
<PB N="164" REF="185">
con&s;i&s;t in convoking, and pre&s;iding in, the Little Council,
as the chief court of ju&s;tice; in collecting the &s;uffrages,
and declaring the &s;entence; but without giving any vote
him&s;elf. And, although ju&s;tice is carried on, and executed,
in the name of the bi&s;hop, yet neither that prince nor the
mayor, has the prerogative of pardoning criminals, or of
mitigating the &s;entence. All cau&s;es, civil as well as criminal,
are brought before this council in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; and in
more important proceedings, an appeal lies to the Sovereign
Council: in both ca&s;es, each party choo&s;es a member of
the council to act as his advocate; which office he is obliged
to di&s;charge without &s;ee or recompence.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign's revenue amounts only to about &pound;. 300
a year: but, mean as his civil li&s;t is, it is &s;till more con&s;ider|able
than his power; for he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s the lea&s;t &s;hare
of the admini&s;tration. The legi&s;lative authority re&s;ides in
the Great and Little Councils combined: the former con&s;i&s;ts
of forty members; and the latter, in which the executive
power is ve&s;ted, is compo&s;ed of twenty-four; the members
of each mu&s;t be married men. Both the&s;e councils elect
their re&s;pective members; and &s;o far the con&s;titution is
entirely ari&s;tocratical. The burgoma&s;ter, or chief of the re|gency,
is cho&s;en by the two councils, and pre&s;ides at their
meetings. He continues in office during life; in which,
however, he, as well as the &s;everal magi&s;trates, mu&s;t be
confirmed annually by the two councils. The &s;alaries an|nexed
to the&s;e po&s;ts are exceedingly moderate: and, indeed,
the general expences of government are &s;o very &s;mall, that,
in proportion to them, its revenues may well be con&s;idered
as abundantly ample.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="186">
IT appears, therefore, that this Prote&s;tant republic, not|with&s;tanding
the &s;overeignty of its Catholic bi&s;hop, enjoys in
the fulle&s;t extent the power of impo&s;ing taxes, contracting
alliances, declaring war and peace; and, in &s;hort, of exer|ci&s;ing
every other act of ab&s;olute and independent legi&s;la|tion.
This &s;ingular con&s;titution is guarantied by Berne,
Friburgh, and Soleure, with whom the town is clo&s;ely allied;
in con&s;equence of which, it becomes a member of the Hel|vetic
Confederacy. And, what is &s;omewhat remarkable,
this alliance between tho&s;e cantons and the town of Bienne,
is of a &s;uperior nature to that of the &s;ame cantons with the
bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le: for the town enjoys the right of &s;ending
deputies to every general diet, ordinary and extraordinary;
whereas the bi&s;hop does not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame privilege. The
language of the country is a provincial German; but, as the
territory borders upon the principality of Neuchatel, the in|habitants
&s;peak al&s;o a kind of corrupted French. They are
a very active and indu&s;trious people: &s;everal manufactures
are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the town, which, con&s;idering its &s;ize, car|ries
on a tolerable trade.</P>
<P>I HAVE often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the common
people of Switzerland are far more intelligent than the &s;ame
rank of men in any other country. Accordingly, I invited
la&s;t night my landlord of the Crown inn to &s;up with me;
and found him by no means di&s;po&s;ed to be a &s;ilent gue&s;t.
He gave me a long account of the late ceremony, when the
citizens did homage to their new bi&s;hop. I was plea&s;ed to
hear him expatiate, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of national pride,
<PB N="166" REF="187">
upon the beauty and grandeur of the &s;cene; the magnifi|cence
of the proce&s;&s;ion; the number of &s;pectators, as well
&s;trangers as natives, who were a&s;&s;embled; together with the
entertainments and balls that were given upon that occa&s;ion.
By the lofty terms in which he &s;poke of this proce&s;&s;ion, you
would have imagined, at lea&s;t, that he had been de&s;cribing
the coronation of the emperor of Germany, or the king of
France: and, in truth, to an inhabitant of Bienne, who&s;e go|vernment
is admini&s;tered without the lea&s;t degree of external
pomp, and where luxury has as yet made but little progre&s;s,
the ceremony mu&s;t have appeared a very &s;triking &s;pectacle.
My ho&s;t's narrative recalled to my remembrance the accounts
of tho&s;e antient feudal &s;overeignties, when the great va&s;&s;als
of the crown did homage to their liege lord; and, while in
<HI>terms</HI> they promi&s;ed him unlimited obedience, maintained,
in <HI>fact,</HI> every e&s;&s;ential of independence.</P>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t been amu&s;ing my&s;elf in &s;ome plea&s;ant walks,
that lie by the &s;ide of the lake, which is here prettily &s;kirted
with country hou&s;es. In my way I pa&s;&s;ed over a plain be|tween
the town and the lake, which the Sovereign Council,
by a kind of agrarian law that does honour to the legi&s;lature,
lately allotted, in di&s;tinct portions, to each burgher, for his
own particular u&s;e: it is entirely laid out in little kitchen-gardens.
The general government, indeed, of this minia|ture
&s;tate, is well admini&s;tered. It has lately adopted the
liberal policy of conferring the burgher&s;hip at an ea&s;y rate:
a wi&s;e regulation, which cannot fail of increa&s;ing the popu|lation
of the town, and extending its commerce.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN AND CANTON OF SOLEURE&mdash;DETAIL OF
THE GOVERNMENT&mdash;ANTIENT AND NEW BURGH|ERS&mdash;
ASSEMBLY OF THE ROSENGARTEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE direct road from Ba&s;le to Soleure lies through the
mid&s;t of the Jura mountains, along the romantic vale
of Bal&s;tal, remarkable for its richne&s;s and fertility: and
though the country is in general exceedingly rocky, yet in
many places it is highly cultivated. The road from Bienne
to Soleure traver&s;es a well-cultivated valley, watered by the
Aar, at the foot of a piked ridge, which forms a branch of
mount Jura; its &s;ides, from the bottom to the &s;ummit, are &s;o
embrowned with overhanging fore&s;ts of pine and fir, as to
exhibit only occa&s;ional intervals of naked rock, remains of
torrents, and a few &s;olitary &s;pecks of pa&s;ture, and are &s;o
&s;teep as, within the extent of five leagues, &s;carcely to di&s;play
the appearance of a &s;ingle hou&s;e, or a trace of the &s;lighte&s;t
foot-way. Near Soleure this chain of the Jura, called <HI>Wei&s;|&s;en&s;tein,</HI>
abruptly dimini&s;hes in height, becomes gradually
&s;loping, and is checkered to its very &s;ummit with fields of
corn and pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>SOLEURE is plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon the Aar, which here
expands its banks and opens into a fine and broad river. I
will not exert the privilege of a traveller, and tell you, what
&s;ome extravagant antiquaries do not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that
<PB N="169" REF="190">
Soleure was built by the patriarch Abraham; but you will
have no difficulty, perhaps, in believing what others main|tain,
that it was one of the twelve towns which were de|&s;troyed
upon the emigration of the original inhabitants into
Gaul. It appears al&s;o probable, from a great number of in|&s;criptions,
medals, and other antiquities, which have been
found in the neighbourhood, that it was re-peopled by a Ro|man
colony; and it certainly was a Roman fortification, as its
antient appellation, <HI>Ca&s;trum Salodurene&s;e,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily implies.
Little more of its hi&s;tory is known, during that period of
ignorance and barbari&s;m which &s;ucceeded the downfal of the
Roman empire, than that it was &s;acked and de&s;troyed by
tho&s;e northern nations, who over-ran the greate&s;t part of Eu|rope.
From the time of its re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, until its admi&s;|&s;ion
into the Helvetic Confederacy in 1481, its &s;tate was &s;imi|lar
to that of many other imperial towns, which acquired a
gradual acce&s;&s;ion of territory, and after various &s;truggles
finally &s;ecured to them&s;elves an ab&s;olute independence.</P>
<P>SOLEURE is a &s;mall but extremely neat town, and is &s;ur|rounded
by regular &s;tone fortifications, erected in the begin|ning
of the pre&s;ent century; the&s;e walls enclo&s;e a circumfe|rence
of &s;carcely more than fifty &s;quare acres, and, including
the &s;uburbs, contain about four thou&s;and &s;ouls. Among the
mo&s;t remarkable objects of curio&s;ity in the town is the new
church of St. Urs, which was begun in 1762, and fini&s;hed
in 1772. It is a noble edifice, of whiti&s;h-grey &s;tone, drawn
from the neighbouring quarries, which admits a poli&s;h, and
is a &s;pecies of rude marble. The lower part of the building
is of the Corinthian, the upper of the Compo&s;ite order: the
<PB N="170" REF="191">
fa&ccedil;ade, which con&s;i&s;ts of a portico, &s;urmounted by an ele|gant
tower, pre&s;ents it&s;elf finely at the extremity of the
principal &s;treet. Pizoni was the architect, and the expence
amounted to at lea&s;t &pound;. 80,000; a con&s;iderable &s;um for &s;o
&s;mall a republic, who&s;e revenues &s;carcely &s;urpa&s;s &pound;. 12,000
<HI>per annum.</HI> The interior is &s;imple yet elegant, and deco|rated
with a few modern paintings of incon&s;iderable merit;
of which the mo&s;t e&s;teemed is the La&s;t Supper, by Corvi, a
Roman arti&s;t. A picture by Rubens and his &s;cholars, in the
church of the Cordeliers, and one by Le Sueur, in that of
the Capuchins, de&s;erve perhaps to be noticed by the travel|ler,
who is fond of the fine arts. The town-hou&s;e is not in
it&s;elf worthy of ob&s;ervation, but is mentioned only as being
the place of meeting for the Great Council and Senate.
The public pri&s;on, newly con&s;tructed, is a &s;olid edifice of
&s;tone, and is well adapted to the purpo&s;e of the building; the
pri&s;oners being confined in &s;eparate cells. Although the penal
laws are &s;evere in theory, yet the judicial &s;entences, in cri|minal
affairs, are &s;o remarkably mild, that a pri&s;oner, on his
acquittal, wrote the following in&s;cription on the wall of his
cell: &startq;He who is inclined to rob, and e&s;cape hanging, let
him rob in the canton of Soleure.&endq;</P>
<P>THE public library de&s;erves to be mentioned, not for the
number or rarity of the volumes, but for the literary zeal of
the Abb&eacute; Herman, canon of the cathedral, to whom it owes
its origin. On my fir&s;t vi&s;it to this town, in 1776, there was
no public collection of books; but a few years ago that in|genious
eccle&s;ia&s;tic ama&s;&s;ed about four hundred volumes from
his own and his friends &s;tock, obtained from government
<PB N="171" REF="192">
an apartment in the town-hou&s;e, where he depo&s;ited them,
and reque&s;ted to be appointed librarian, but without a &s;alary.
His petition being granted, he continued to augment his
little collection; and from this &s;mall beginning has increa&s;ed
it already to eleven thou&s;and books, among which are above
a hundred and fifty printed in the fifteenth century. At the
two extremities of the room are in&s;cribed the names of the
benefactors to this library. As yet there is no fund
e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;upport or augmentation of this collec|tion.
The Abb&eacute; has al&s;o begun to form a cabinet of medals;
which, though at pre&s;ent extremely &s;mall, will increa&s;e like
the library. He pointed out to me a very rare medal, that
was di&s;covered in digging the foundation for the new cathe|dral.
It is in bronze, of the middle &s;ize. On one &s;ide is the
head of Septimius Severus, with the following in&s;cription,
<HI>L. Septimius Severus Pius Aug. P. M. Tr. P. xviii. Co&s;. iii.
P. P.</HI> On the rever&s;e, a figure &s;itting, before it a prow of a
&s;hip, and a genius or little boy. Great merit is due to the
Abb&eacute; for having given birth to this collection, at fir&s;t alone
and un&s;upported, and in &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a manner, as his in|come
does not exceed &pound;. 60 <HI>per annum;</HI> and in a town
where literature is not much encouraged. This learned
eccle&s;ia&s;tic is now employed in writing an account of Soleure
at the period of the Reformation; and is collecting ample
materials for a complete hi&s;tory of the canton. With re&s;pect
to natural hi&s;tory, the only cabinet in the town is that
formed by Senator Wallier: it is a &s;mall collection, but well
cho&s;en, and particularly intere&s;ting to the naturali&s;t who
travels into the&s;e parts, becau&s;e the ingenious collector has
<PB REF="193">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="172" REF="194">
chiefly confined him&s;elf to the minerals and petrifactions of
the canton.</P>
<P>THE circumjacent country is exceedingly plea&s;ing and
diver&s;ified, and exhibits &s;everal points of view, which are as
agreeable as wild, and as plea&s;ing as romantic. Among
the&s;e we were particularly &s;truck with the &s;ituation of the
hermitage called des Croix, about half a mile from the town,
near the &s;tone quarry: it is a mo&s;t agreeable rece&s;s at the ex|tremity
of a &s;mall wood, and between two ridges of bare
perpendicular rocks, watered by a lively &s;tream; one extre|mity
is clo&s;ed by a &s;mall wood, and the other opens into
fertile grounds backed by the dark Jura. Among the villas,
in the environs, remarkable for their po&s;ition, may be men|tioned
Ricaberg, built by Mr. de Vigur; it &s;tands at the bot|tom
of a gentle hill, declining towards the winding Aar, and
commands a view of Soleure, half hid by the intervening
trees; and Bleikenberg, belonging to Major de Roll, &s;ituated
amid waving grounds divided into enclo&s;ures, &s;imilar to the
fertile counties of England; the dark Jura ri&s;ing like the
highlands of Scotland; and at a di&s;tance the &s;ublime alps,
which characteri&s;e this romantic country.</P>
<P>THE canton of Soleure, which holds the eleventh rank in
the Helvetic Confederacy, &s;tretches partly through the plain,
and partly along the chains of the Jura, and contains about
50,000 &s;ouls, including the inhabitants of the capital. The
&s;oil is, for the mo&s;t part, exceedingly fertile in corn, and
tho&s;e di&s;tricts which lie within the Jura, abound in excellent
<PB N="173" REF="195">
pa&s;tures. The trade, both of the town and of the canton, is
of little value, although they are very commodiou&s;ly
&s;ituated for an exten&s;ive commerce. It is divided into
eleven di&s;tricts or bailliages, called Interior and Exterior;
the former are governed by bailifs, who are &s;enators, and
remain in the towns: the latter, by bailifs drawn from the
members of the Great Council, who re&s;ide in their bail|liages.</P>
<P>THE following is a li&s;t of the bailliages, with their ave|rage

<P>THE inhabitants of the canton are Catholics, except|ing
tho&s;e in the bailliage of Buckegberg, who profe&s;s
the Reformed religion. In &s;piritual affairs, the Catholics
depend on three bi&s;hops: the greate&s;t part of the capi|tal,
the bailliages of Laeberen and Flamenthal, are in the
dioce&s;e of the bi&s;hop of Lau&s;anne, re&s;ident at Friburg; the
remainder of the capital, the bailliage of Krieg&s;tetten, and
the villages in the bailliage of Olten, in that of the bi&s;hop of
Con&s;tance; while the other bailliages, and the town of Olten,
depend on the bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le. But neither of the&s;e bi&s;hops
<PB N="174" REF="196">
can i&s;&s;ue any ordinance, or even vi&s;it their dioce&s;es, without
the approbation of the Senate. There are two chapters in
this canton; one at Soleure, founded, in 930, by Queen Ber|tha,
widow of Rhodolph II. King of Burgundy, is compo&s;ed
of a provo&s;t, who&s;e &s;alary amounts to &pound;. 360 <HI>per annum;</HI>
and of eleven canons, each of whom enjoys a revenue of
&pound;. 160. The provo&s;t is cho&s;en by the Senate, and the canons
are appointed alternately by the Pope and Senate. The
other chapter, of Schoenenwerth, founded by the antient
counts of Falken&s;tein, con&s;i&s;ts of a provo&s;t and five canons,
nominated by the Senate. The annual &s;alary of the provo&s;t
is &pound;. 125, and of each canon &pound;. 100. There are al&s;o one
abbey of Benedictines, four convents, and three nunneries:
the revenues of the&s;e religious hou&s;es amount to &pound;. 2,250.
The principal charitable in&s;titutions are, an ho&s;pital at
Soleure, and another at Olten, for the reception of burghers,
&s;ubjects, and foreigners; the foundation of Thurigan, for
old per&s;ons of both &s;exes, belonging to the burgher&s;hip; a
foundling ho&s;pital for orphans, and for children of poor
burghers; and the ho&s;pital of St. Catharine, for the in&s;ane
and incurables.</P>
<P>THE only per&s;ons in the canton of Soleure, who profe&s;s
the Reformed religion, are tho&s;e who inhabit the bailliage
of Buckegberg. In eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, the inhabitants,
though &s;ubject to Soleure, are under the protection of Berne.
Formerly this complication of political and religious intere&s;ts
created frequent mi&s;under&s;tandings between the two can|tons,
but matters were amicably and finally adju&s;ted, on the
18th of November 1681, at the treaty of Winingen. The
<PB N="175" REF="197">
inhabitants take the oath of fidelity, every third year, to the
government of Soleure; but if aggrieved in their religious
e&s;tabli&s;hment, can have recour&s;e to Berne. The Senate of
Berne nominates to the vacant benefices, but the prie&s;ts
are under the nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining the confirmation of the
chapter of Soleure. A deputy from Berne pre&s;ents the new
mini&s;ter to his pari&s;hioners; but the bailif is obliged to be
pre&s;ent at this ceremony, as deputy from the republic of
Soleure. Berne enjoys al&s;o &s;upreme juri&s;diction in criminal
affairs. If a criminal is arre&s;ted for any capital offence, he
is tried by the bailif of Buckegberg, and the jury of the
bailliage: and, if condemned to death, he is delivered for
execution to Berne, provided that republic defrays the ex|pence
of the trial. Soleure enjoys all the other rights of
&s;overeignty; &s;uch as the power of levying taxes, appeals in
the la&s;t re&s;ort; and even decides all matrimonial and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
concerns, with this provi&s;o, that the deci&s;ion &s;hall
be regulated according to the articles of the treaty of Wi|ningen.
Among the natives in the canton, &s;everal inhabit|ing
the bailliages of Thier&s;tein and Gildenberg, were &s;erfs,
but, in 1785, their &s;ervitude, &s;o contrary to the principles
of that equal liberty which pervades this country, was
aboli&s;hed, to the honour of the pre&s;ent government.</P>
<P>THE canton furni&s;hes France with two companies for
the Swi&s;s guards, and &s;everal companies in the different
marching regiments, according to the capitulation concluded
between the King of France and the Catholic cantons, and
their co-allies, in 1764, for the term of twenty-five years.
It has al&s;o a regiment in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice; of which the
<PB N="176" REF="198">
colonel and the companies of fu&s;ileers can be filled only by
the <HI>antient</HI> burghers. With re&s;pect to the militia of the
canton, all the &s;ubjects, from the age of fifteen to that of
&s;ixty, are enrolled into &s;ix regiments, forming altogether
about 8000 men, exclu&s;ive of 240 dragoons, and the corps
of artillery, amounting to 600 men. The colonel of each
regiment is always a &s;enator, and the major a member of
the Great Council, who is u&s;ually an officer retired from
foreign &s;ervice; the captains are either members of the
Great Council or <HI>antient</HI> burghers; the fir&s;t lieutenants are
u&s;ually <HI>antient</HI> burghers, while the rank of &s;econd lieute|nants
and en&s;igns is u&s;ually filled by the principal pea&s;ants.</P>
<P>THE militia are a&s;&s;embled and reviewed in May and
September; and in the &s;pring and autumn are exerci&s;ed in
their re&s;pective villages by the under-lieutenants and en|&s;igns.
According to a plan of defence, regulated in 1668,
between the members of the Helvetic Confederacy, the can|ton
of Soleure is bound to furni&s;h 600 for its fir&s;t contin|gency;
for this &s;upply 100 men, together with officers, are
annually &s;elected from each of the &s;ix regiments, who are
to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to march at a moment's
warning. In ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, this contingency may be
doubled or tripled in the &s;ame manner. The burghers are
incorporated in the company of fu&s;ileers, and exerci&s;e them|&s;elves
on Sundays and &s;aints days, after divine &s;ervice, by
&s;hooting at marks: government furni&s;hes powder and ball,
and di&s;tributes prizes to the be&s;t mark&s;men. The re|maining
inhabitants of the capital and environs, who are not
burghers, form a &s;eparate body, commanded by the captain
<PB N="177" REF="199">
of the town: they are al&s;o occa&s;ionally exerci&s;ed, and
mount guard on the day of St. John the Bapti&s;t, when the
<HI>Ro&s;engarten,</HI> or the general meeting of the burghers, is
a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign power re&s;ides in the Great Council, which,
comprizing the Senate or Little Council of thirty-&s;ix, con|&s;i&s;ts
of a hundred and two members, cho&s;en by the Senate,
in equal proportions, from the eleven tribes or companies
into which the <HI>antient</HI> burghers are di&s;tributed: and in all
in&s;tances the new member is taken from the company to
which the la&s;t member belonged.</P>
<P>THE prerogatives of the Great Council are, to enact and
abrogate laws; to explain any ob&s;cure parts of the con&s;titu|tion;
and even make alterations in the form of government,
&s;hould the circum&s;tances require it; to levy taxes; to declare
war and conclude peace; to contract alliances; to receive
appeals in criminal cau&s;es from the burghers of the capital;
and in civil proce&s;&s;es, above the &s;um of 100 Swi&s;s livres, or
&pound;. 6. 3<HI>s.;</HI> to confer the <HI>new</HI> burgher&s;hip; to elect the trea|&s;urer,
or the fourth chief of the republic, from the antient
eleven &s;enators; to nominate to the &s;even exterior bailliages,
and to the four Italian governments of Lugano, Locarno, Men|dri&s;io,
and Valmaggia, when the turn of appointing to tho&s;e
governments belongs to Soleure; to choo&s;e the deputies for
the diet of Frauenfield, and tho&s;e for any extraordinary
meetings of the Helvetic Confederacy; though in both the&s;e
ca&s;es it is the cu&s;tom to appoint a &s;enator, and u&s;ually either
of the four chiefs, the reigning advoyer excepted, who is
<PB N="178" REF="200">
not permitted to be ab&s;ent during the year of his admini|&s;tration.</P>
<P>THERE are generally a few &s;upernumerary members in
the Great Council, which circum&s;tance proceeds from the
method of appointing the bailifs. On the nomination of a
bailif, his &s;eat in the Great Council being e&s;teemed vacant, is
on the next day filled up by a member of the &s;ame company
in which he is in&s;cribed. At the conclu&s;ion of his bailliage
he again takes his &s;eat, pre&s;erving his antient rank, though
con&s;idered as a &s;upernumerary, until one of the &s;ix members
of his tribe makes a vacancy. The qualifications for a re|ception
into the Great Council are, that the candidate &s;hall
be twenty years of age, an <HI>antient</HI> burgher, and member of
the &s;ame tribe in which the vacancy happens: and with re|&s;pect
to the la&s;t-mentioned qualification, it is nece&s;&s;ary that
the candidate, if in&s;cribed in a company different from that
of his father, mu&s;t, according to a decree pa&s;&s;ed in 1764,
have been a member of that company during a full year.</P>
<P>THE Great Council a&s;&s;embles ordinarily once every
month; and extraordinarily, on being convened by the Se|nate.</P>
<P>THE Senate, or Little Council, a con&s;tituent part of the
Great Council, is compo&s;ed of the two advoyers or chiefs of
the republic, who annually alternate; the chancellor or &s;e|cretary
of &s;tate, who has no vote either in the Senate or Great
Council; and thirty-three &s;enators drawn from the remaining
&s;ixty-&s;ix members of the Great Council, in equal proportion
<PB N="179" REF="201">
from the eleven tribes. The appointment and annual con|firmation
of the advoyers and banneret by the a&s;&s;embly of
burghers, as well as the confirmation of the &s;enators and
members of the Great Council, in their &s;everal charges, will
be hereafter de&s;cribed, under the article of <HI>Ro&s;engarten.</HI></P>
<P>THE thirty-three &s;enators who, in conjunction with the
two advoyers and chancellor, form the Senate, are divided into
eleven &s;eniors, and twenty-two juniors. From the eleven
&s;eniors the four principal magi&s;trates are always cho&s;en, the
two advoyers, the banneret, and trea&s;urer. Upon a vacancy
among the eleven, the right of election, though &s;aid to
re&s;ide in the twenty-three juniors, is always exerci&s;ed ac|cording
to &s;eniority: the mo&s;t antient in rank among the
three junior coun&s;ellors, who are of the &s;ame tribe to which
the late member belonged, pre&s;ents him&s;elf of cour&s;e, and is
immediately appointed, or rather confirmed, by the twenty-three
juniors. Upon the death or promotion of one among the
latter, his place is immediately filled up by the two advoyers
and eleven &s;eniors. The Senate is entru&s;ted with the ex|ecutive
power, and with the care of the police; has &s;upreme
and final juri&s;diction in all criminal cau&s;es, tho&s;e only ex|cepted
in which a burgher of the capital is concerned, who
may appeal from their deci&s;ion to the Great Council; and gives
judgment in all civil proce&s;&s;es not exceeding the value of a
hundred Swi&s;s livres. The Senate convokes the Great
Council; examines and dige&s;ts all affairs before they are
laid before that &s;upreme a&s;&s;embly; fills up the vacant places
therein; and in their own body; either directly or indirectly,
<PB N="180" REF="202">
nominates to almo&s;t all the important charges of the re|public;
appoints to the principal eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices; re|ceives
all appeals, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, from the inferior
courts of ju&s;tice; judges all civil cau&s;es in the la&s;t re&s;ort,
who&s;e value does not exceed a certain &s;um; has &s;upreme
and final juri&s;diction over all criminal affairs, excepting tho&s;e
which concern the burghers of the capital. The qualifi|cations
of a &s;enator are, that he &s;hall be twenty-four years of
age, a member of the Great Council, and drawn from the
&s;ame company to which the la&s;t &s;enator belonged. This
body a&s;&s;embles three times in the week, and extraordinarily,
as often as occa&s;ion requires; and it is convoked by the reign|ing
advoyer. The &s;alaries of the &s;enators are as follows;

<P>THE burghers of Soleure are divided into <HI>antient</HI> and
<HI>new;</HI> the former of whom are alone capable of being elected
members of the Great Council, or of enjoying any &s;hare in
the admini&s;tration of affairs. The origin of this di&s;tinction
is to be dated from the year 1681, from the following cau&s;es.
Several foreign families, which &s;ettled at Soleure and obtain|ed
the right of burgher&s;hip, being admitted into the Great
Council, gave umbrage to tho&s;e antient and illu&s;trious fami|lies,
who&s;e ance&s;tors had, by their valour and prudence, laid
the foundation of the republic. In order to prevent the far|ther
participation of honours and emoluments, to which
they conceived them&s;elves &s;olely entitled, the Great Council
i&s;&s;ued an edict, in 1681, that tho&s;e families only, which at
that epoch enjoyed the rights of burgher&s;hip, &s;hould be ex|clu&s;ively
<PB N="182" REF="204">
qualified to hold any office of government; and
that, for the future, no per&s;on &s;hould be admitted to that
right, until the families then exi&s;ting &s;hould be reduced to
twenty-five. It was at the &s;ame time enacted, that the&s;e
families and their de&s;cendants &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
name of <HI>antient</HI> burghers, and that tho&s;e, who from that
period &s;hould be received into the burgher&s;hip, &s;hould be
called <HI>new</HI> burghers. It was al&s;o added, that any burgher
who &s;hould make any propo&s;ition contrary to this law,
&s;hould be bani&s;hed from the canton, and that his goods
&s;hould be confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>BESIDE the exclu&s;ive privilege of being entitled to any
office of government, the <HI>antient</HI> burghers enjoy al&s;o the
right of being &s;olely appointed canons in the chapters of
Soleure and Schoenenworth, and of holding any eccle&s;ia&s;tical
benefice in the gift of the Senate. But as there are at
pre&s;ent a great deficiency of clergymen among the <HI>antient</HI>
burghers, it will probably &s;oon be thought nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;|pen&s;e
with the law on this article, and to permit the <HI>new</HI>
burghers, and every &s;ubject of the canton, to be candidates
for vacant livings. There are about eighty-five families
who po&s;&s;e&s;s the right of <HI>antient</HI> burgher&s;hip, and of the&s;e
about thirty-four of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, &s;upply the mem|bers
of the Great Council, and fill all the various depart|ments
of government.</P>
<P>THE rights of the <HI>new</HI> burghers con&s;i&s;t in nominating

burghers, and as, by the edict of 1681, they mu&s;t retire
from the a&s;&s;embly if there &s;hould be any difficulty or op|po&s;ition;
this right of election may be con&s;idered as little
more than a mere formality. In all other in&s;tances, ex|cepting
in tho&s;e concerns which relate to government, the
<HI>new</HI> burghers enjoy the &s;ame privilege as the <HI>antient</HI> burgh|ers;
&s;uch as freedom of trade and commerce; of being
proprietors of hou&s;es and land in the capital and its di&s;trict.
They are al&s;o entitled to hold &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices as
are in the gift of the chapters and of individuals.</P>
<P>THE burghers, both <HI>antient</HI> and <HI>new,</HI> are di&s;tributed into
eleven tribes or companies, each whereof furni&s;hes three
&s;enators and &s;ix members of the Great Council. Every per|&s;on
may choo&s;e the company into which he in&s;cribes his
name; but having once in&s;cribed him&s;elf, he cannot change
it. For the purpo&s;e of obtaining a place as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible
in the government, a young noble &s;elects that com|pany
in which there is &s;oon likely to be a vacancy; but if
he fixes upon one different from that in which his father
is incorporated, he mu&s;t have been received a member
during a whole year, before he can be a candidate for ad|mi&s;&s;ion
into the Great Council.</P>
<P>THE general a&s;&s;embly of <HI>antient</HI> and <HI>new</HI> burghers,
called <HI>Ro&s;engarten,</HI> which meets on St. John the Bapti&s;t's
day, for the purpo&s;e of electing or confirming the charges
of advoyer, banneret, and <HI>grand &s;autier,</HI> is a ceremony
<PB N="184" REF="206">
which de&s;erves to be de&s;cribed for its &s;ingularity; particu|larly
as it will convey to you &s;ome idea of tho&s;e annual elec|tions,
or rather confirmations, of the principal officers,
which take place in mo&s;t of the&s;e ari&s;tocratical &s;tates. This
a&s;&s;embly is held in the church of the Cordeliers, and is de|nominated
<HI>Ro&s;engarten,</HI> or Garden of Ro&s;es; either becau&s;e
a no&s;egay of flowers, which every burgher carries in his
hand, was formerly compo&s;ed of ro&s;es; or, as others pretend,
becau&s;e this meeting u&s;ed to be convened in the garden of
the Cordeliers, which is &s;aid to have been called the Garden
of Ro&s;es. But, in&s;tead of &s;earching into fanciful etymo|logies,
I &s;hall de&s;cribe what pa&s;&s;es at this annual meeting.</P>
<P>ABOUT &s;ix in the morning, the advoyer out of office, the
&s;enators, members of the Great Council, and the <HI>antient</HI>
and <HI>new</HI> burghers, a&s;&s;emble in their re&s;pective companies.
After the repetition of certain &s;ignals, the reigning advoyer,
accompanied by the chancellor, the &s;ecretary of the finances,
and &s;everal other officers of &s;tate, repair, with drums beating
and trumpets &s;ounding, from the town-hou&s;e to the church
of the Cordeliers; where, after pre&s;enting his offering upon
the altar of the Virgin, he &s;eats him&s;elf on a throne, which
is placed near the altar. Soon afterwards the &s;enators and
remaining members of the Great Council make their appear|ance
at the head of their re&s;pective tribes; and having pre|&s;ented
their offerings, keep the &s;ame rank and &s;tations,
which they maintained on entering the church; the ad|voyer,
out of office excepted, who places him&s;elf near his
colleague on the throne. At the conclu&s;ion of ma&s;s accom|panied
with mu&s;ic, all but the burghers retire, and the
<PB N="185" REF="207">
doors of the church are clo&s;ed. The advoyer, with his &s;cep|ter
in his hand, pronounces an harangue; then delivering
up the &s;cepter and &s;eals, re&s;igns his dignity, and receives the
thanks of the a&s;&s;embly, by the mouth of the attorney-gene|ral,
for his zeal and attention during the year of his govern|ment.
Next follow, in the &s;ame manner, the re&s;ignations of
the banneret and of the attorney-general; the former of
whom is thanked, in the name of the a&s;&s;embly, by the attor|ney-general,
and the latter by the advoyer who has ju&s;t re|&s;igned.</P>
<P>THIS ceremony being fini&s;hed, the two advoyers, ban|nerets,
attorney-general, and antient &s;enators, retire from the
choir to another part of the church; and the chancellor
&s;ummoning the junior &s;enators into the choir, reads over the
name of each antient &s;enator, and of the attorney-general,
and demands, if the junior &s;enators are plea&s;ed to confirm
them in their charges for another year. This approbation
being obtained, the chancellor and junior &s;enators repair to
the a&s;&s;embly in the body of the church, were the chancellor
reads over the names of the &s;enior &s;enators and attorney-general
confirmed by the juniors, and demands the approba|tion
of the whole a&s;&s;embly of burghers. Upon this, the ad|voyer
who has ju&s;t re&s;igned, and all the &s;enators, except the
advoyer out of office and the banneret, come into the
church, and take their re&s;pective oaths. The chancellor
then acquainting the a&s;&s;embly, that they mu&s;t proceed to the
election of the reigning advoyer; the advoyer, who has ju&s;t
re&s;igned, propo&s;es his colleague: the officer of &s;tate, called
<HI>Grand Sautier,</HI> cries out, &startq;Let all tho&s;e who choo&s;e to elect
<PB N="186" REF="208">
the right noble A. B. the reigning advoyer, hold up their
hands under oath;&endq; and immediately informing the ad|voyer
of his election, the latter comes into the church, takes
the oath from the chancellor, and receives the oath from the
<HI>Grand Sautier.</HI> The election of the banneret is made in the
&s;ame manner: the &s;ame per&s;on, who had ju&s;t re&s;igned his
office, being propo&s;ed to the a&s;&s;embly by the reigning ad|voyer,
and accepted, gives his hand to the reigning ad|voyer,
as he never takes the oath but in time of war. The
<HI>grand &s;autier</HI> then retiring, is propo&s;ed and recommended
by the reigning advoyer, and re-entering the church, he al&s;o
takes the oath to government.</P>
<P>AT the end of the&s;e elections, &s;everal decrees of the Great
Council are read, and particularly that which relates to the
right of <HI>antient</HI> burgher&s;hip, and the election of the ad|voyer,
banneret, and <HI>grand &s;autier;</HI> by which it is enacted,
that in ca&s;e any oppo&s;ition &s;hould be made to the regular
order of appointment, the <HI>new</HI> burghers &s;hall retire from
the a&s;&s;embly, and the election be ve&s;ted &s;olely in the <HI>antient</HI>
burghers. The &s;ame magi&s;trates are always re-elected or
confirmed in their &s;everal places: the advoyer out of office
is nominated reigning advoyer; on the death of either of
the advoyers, the banneret is of cour&s;e appointed to the va|cant
office, and is &s;ucceeded by the trea&s;urer, only under|going
the formality of a nomination.</P>
<P>AT the conclu&s;ion of this ceremony, the reigning ad|voyer,
at the head of the Senate, pa&s;&s;es through two lines of
troops under arms to the town-hou&s;e, where the fir&s;t magi&s;|trate
<PB N="187" REF="209">
and the antient &s;enators confirm the junior &s;enators;
after which he returns to his own hou&s;e, accompanied by
the Senate and members of the Great Council, and is com|plimented,
fir&s;t by the banneret, and afterwards by the
chancellor.</P>
<P>FROM the con&s;ideration of this detail we may conclude,
that tho&s;e authors have erred who call the government of
Soleure ari&s;to-democratical, for it is certainly a mo&s;t com|plete
ari&s;tocracy: ina&s;much as the &s;upreme government re|&s;ides
in the Great Council, the members whereof are exclu|&s;ively
taken from the <HI>antient</HI> burghers; as there are only
eighty-one families which enjoy that right, and no more
can be added until they are reduced to twenty-five; as of
the&s;e &s;carcely more than thirty enjoy any &s;hare in the
government; and la&s;tly, as the election and annual con|firmation
of the principal magi&s;trates is confined to the <HI>an|tient</HI>
burghers, if there &s;hould be any oppo&s;ition in the ge|neral
a&s;&s;embly called Ro&s;engarten. The government, how|ever,
under what&s;oever title it may be cla&s;&s;ed, is mild and
equitable; and the people are tranquil and contented.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 21.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TREATIES WITH FRANCE&mdash;REFLECTIONS ON FO|REIGN
SERVICE.</HEAD>
<P>THE French emba&s;&s;ador to the Helvetic body re&s;ides
in Soleure, and di&s;tributes tho&s;e annual pen&s;ions
which the king his ma&s;ter has &s;tipulated by treaty to pay to
the Catholic cantons. Louis the Eleventh was the fir&s;t
French monarch who employed Swi&s;s troops; and granted
&s;ub&s;idies to the &s;tates, which have &s;ince been con&s;iderably
augmented by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The perpetual alliance which
Francis the Fir&s;t concluded with the Swi&s;s cantons, &s;oon
after the battle of Marignano, is con&s;idered as the ba&s;is of
every &s;ub&s;equent treaty between the two contracting powers.
Several of that king's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors derived con&s;iderable advan|tages
from the Swi&s;s infantry in their &s;ervice: they aided
Henry the Fourth in e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf upon the throne of
his ance&s;tors; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted both Louis the Thirteenth and his
&s;on, in the &s;everal wars in which they were engaged. No
troops indeed have ever been more ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed for
their fidelity, valour, and excellent di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>THE general alliance between France and the whole Hel|vetic
union, ratified by Louis the Fourteenth in 1663, was to
remain in force during the joint lives of that monarch, and
his &s;on the dauphin, and for eight years after the death of
either. Towards the end of his reign, when Louis, on ac|count
<PB N="189" REF="211">
of his &s;on's death, propo&s;ed to renew the treaty in his
own and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or's name, the Prote&s;tant cantons refu&s;ed
their con&s;ent: and it was concluded only with the Catholic
cantons, and the republic of the Vallais.</P>
<P>THIS alliance differed from the former treaties in the fol|lowing
very e&s;&s;ential articles: It &s;tipulated that, if the king|dom
of France &s;hould be invaded, the contracting republics
&s;hould permit an additional levy to be rai&s;ed at his maje&s;ty's
expence, not exceeding &s;ixteen thou&s;and men; that if the
Helvetic body, or any particular canton, &s;hould be attacked
by a foreign power, the king engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with as
many forces as &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary: and finally, that
if any di&s;&s;en&s;ions &s;hould ari&s;e between the contracting can|tons,
his maje&s;ty &s;hould, at the reque&s;t of the aggrieved
party, try all gentle methods of effecting a reconciliation;
but if the&s;e &s;hould fail, the king agreed, both in his own
name, and in that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to compel the aggre&s;&s;or
to abide by the treaties concluded between the cantons and
their allies. This la&s;t article, as it &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
to authorize the interference of the king of France with the
politics of Switzerland, appeared dangerous to many of the
Swi&s;s, and incon&s;i&s;tent with that ab&s;olute independence,
which they had hitherto prized above all other advantages.</P>
<P>FRANCE having long in vain attempted to per&s;uade the
Prote&s;tant cantons to accede to the alliance, that a general
treaty with the whole Helvetic body might be renewed, at
length, after much oppo&s;ition and repeated negociations,
&s;ucceeded in effecting the mea&s;ure. This important league
<PB N="190" REF="212">
was concluded at Soleure in May 1777, between the king of
France on one &s;ide, and the thirteen cantons and their allies
on the other, to continue in force during fifty years. By this
treaty it is agreed, that if the kingdom of France &s;hould be
invaded, the cantons and their allies &s;hall furni&s;h an addi|tional
levy of &s;ix thou&s;and men; and if the cantons, or any
of their allies, &s;hould be attacked, the king, if required,
engages to furni&s;h them, at his own expence, with &s;uch &s;uc|cours
as may be deemed nece&s;&s;ary. That article of the treaty
with the Catholic cantons in 1715, which related to the me|diation
of the king, if any di&s;putes &s;hould ari&s;e between the
thirteen cantons, is very properly and wi&s;ely omitted.</P>
<P>BEFORE this alliance, none of the Prote&s;tant &s;tates re|ceived
any pen&s;ions from France: but by the &s;ixteenth arti|cle,
the Prote&s;tants of Glarus and Appenzel, and the town of
Bienne, have agreed to accept <HI>les argents de paix et d'alli|ance,</HI>
as the&s;e &s;ub&s;idies are here called. The acceptance of
pen&s;ions derogates greatly from that &s;pirit of ab&s;olute inde|pendence,
which all the Prote&s;tant cantons and &s;tates of
Switzerland have hitherto affected to profe&s;s; and it would
have reflected much greater honour on the Swi&s;s nation, if
the whole body had imitated Zuric, Berne, Ba&s;le, and Schaff|hau&s;en,
in forming the league upon terms of perfect equa|lity,
and rejecting the proffered pen&s;ions, which give an air
of venality to their treaties with France.</P>
<P>IT has long been a controverted que&s;tion, whether Swit|zerland
gains or lo&s;es by furni&s;hing, according to the tenor
of her alliance with France, Sardinia, Naples, and Holland,
<PB N="191" REF="213">
&s;uch numbers of her natives to &s;erve in foreign armies.
That the fidelity of the&s;e troops is &s;o well recogni&s;ed, as to
be cho&s;en to be the life-guards of &s;everal &s;overeigns, is a cir|cum&s;tance
which undoubtedly redounds much to the ho|nour
of the national character: but, on the other hand, to
traffic with the blood of &s;ubjects, and, for paltry &s;ub&s;idies, to
fight the battle of any king, in any cau&s;e, &s;eems to betray a
mercenary &s;pirit, uncontrouled by con&s;iderations of ju&s;tice
and humanity. It has been urged, that if Switzerland did
not furni&s;h the&s;e &s;upplies to foreign nations, &s;he would be
over-&s;tocked with inhabitants; and that the natives would
be obliged, like the northern hives of old, to emigrate for
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence: for in many parts there is no commerce, and
the mountainous tracts cannot &s;upply &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for
&s;uch a numerous people. In reply to this rea&s;oning, it may
be alledged, that the Swi&s;s do not u&s;e all the re&s;ources in
their power: commerce might be more generally cultivated
and encouraged; as there is no part of Switzerland far re|moved
from the principal rivers and great lakes, mo&s;t of
which have a direct communication with the &s;ea.</P>
<P>BUT, to be convinced that they have not exhau&s;ted all
the advantages to which they might re&s;ort, let them look
back on antient Greece, and the immen&s;e populou&s;ne&s;s in &s;o
confined a country; or, what is more open to their ob&s;erva|tion,
let them con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the United Provin|ces,
and the abundance which tho&s;e indu&s;trious people en|joy
on a tract of land &s;natched from an element perpetually
reclaiming its prior occupancy. But the Swi&s;s need not be
reminded of antient or foreign examples: Geneva and St.
<PB N="192" REF="214">
Gallen are, for their extent, exceedingly populous; and yet
the natural productions of their lands are by no means &s;uf|ficient
to &s;upport all the inhabitants. Appenzel and Vallen|gin
are entirely mountainous; neverthele&s;s both tho&s;e di&s;|tricts
are remarkably well peopled, and derive, by means of
commerce and indu&s;try, all the nece&s;&s;aries of life in great
plenty. Indeed Switzerland is &s;o far from being over-&s;tock|ed
with people, that in mo&s;t of the great towns there is a
manife&s;t deficiency of inhabitants; and in &s;everal parts of
their country, hands are frequently wanting for the common
purpo&s;es of agriculture.</P>
<P>THESE reflections &s;eem to prove the mi&s;taken policy of
Switzerland, in letting out her troops to foreign &s;tates. On
the contrary, many circum&s;tances may be alledged in its fa|vour.
This practice has tended to keep up the military
&s;pirits of the Swi&s;s, even during a &s;tate of profound peace,
which has now continued, with few interruptions, for three
hundred years. The &s;everal cantons not only have in con|&s;tant
re&s;erve, and without the lea&s;t expence, a body of well-di&s;ciplined
forces, which they can recal at a moment's warn|ing;
but it becomes the intere&s;t, for that rea&s;on, of tho&s;e
foreign powers, whom they furni&s;h with men, not to fo|ment
any divi&s;ions among them, which might render the
pre&s;ence of their troops nece&s;&s;ary at home. Add to this,
that the privileges which the Swi&s;s enjoy in France, and the
very advantageous articles, relating to commerce, &s;ecured to
them in all their treaties, &s;eem to &s;trengthen the argument
for continuing their connections of this kind with that king|dom.
This argument, however, would be more conclu&s;ive,
<PB N="193" REF="215">
if tho&s;e privileges were &s;till pre&s;erved in the &s;ame latitude
as was granted by the ninth article of the Perpetual Peace
concluded with Francis I. in 1516, and confirmed by &s;everal
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive treaties. But the ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e. The&s;e
immunities have been gradually and almo&s;t imperceptibly
violated: the Swi&s;s merchants were &s;ubjected to the poll-tax;
and fre&s;h duties, contrary to the tenor of their rights, were
impo&s;ed on their merchandi&s;e. During the admini&s;tration
of the Duke d'Aiguillon, the Swi&s;s complaining of the&s;e in|fractions;
a negociation was begun at Soleure with the
French emba&s;&s;ador, which produced, however, no other
effect than a &s;hort letter from the mini&s;ter, declining, in
the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner, to redre&s;s the grievances, though
founded on the faith of treaties.</P>
<P>ON the late renovation of the Perpetual Peace, in 1777,
it was expected that this matter of di&s;pute would be ami|cably
adju&s;ted; and the Count de Vergennes in&s;inuated, that
&s;uch was the intention of the court of Ver&s;ailles. Many
cantons, and particularly Zuric, were principally induced by
the&s;e motives and the&s;e expectations to accede to the alli|ance;
but not wholly tru&s;ting, however, to the promi&s;es of
the French cabinet, it was in&s;i&s;ted that an article explaining
and confirming the &s;aid privileges &s;hould be in&s;erted in the
new treaty. The mini&s;ter, with his u&s;ual addre&s;s, eluded a
direct mention of the demanded rights; but, in order not
to lo&s;e the confidence of a nation, at a time when he
mo&s;t wi&s;hed to obtain it, the king engaged, by the 18th
article, to <HI>pre&s;erve to the Swi&s;s tho&s;e privileges and advan|tages
to which they had a legitimate right, and which they had
<PB N="194" REF="216">
hitherto enjoyed in France.</HI> And the Swi&s;s agreed to po&s;tpone
<HI>the preci&s;e determination of the nature and extent of the &s;aid
privileges to future conferences, wherein tho&s;e matters &s;hould
be regulated with fidelity and equity.</HI> It mu&s;t appear a&s;toni&s;h|ing
that the Swi&s;s &s;hould be contented with &s;o ambiguous a
declaration; or could be led to believe, that the French court
would pre&s;erve to them their legitimate immunities, in the
moment when that legitimacy was a &s;ubject of contention.
The Helvetic body had &s;oon occa&s;ion to repent of their cre|dulity.
For, in 1781, the king of France i&s;&s;ued an edict irre|vocably
&s;ubjecting the Swi&s;s, who po&s;&s;e&s;s lands in France, to
the poll-tax, and to all the national impo&s;ts: and laid the
&s;ame duties on their merchandi&s;e imported into France, as
are paid by the merchants of other countries, chee&s;e and
linens excepted, which were taxed at a reduced value.</P>
<P>BUT a &s;till &s;everer blow was levelled again&s;t the Swi&s;s in
1786; when, notwith&s;tanding the expre&s;s re&s;ervation granted
in the Perpetual Peace, the importation of linens was pro|hibited
in France. The prohibition of this branch of com|merce,
which furni&s;hed employment to &s;o many hands in
various parts of Switzerland, particularly in the cantons of
Zuric, Glarus, and Appenzel, and was almo&s;t the &s;ole re|&s;ource
of the natives, &s;pread a &s;en&s;ible alarm among them;
but was not productive of any &s;erious con&s;equences. After
the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e and agitation were pa&s;t, the indu&s;try of
the Swi&s;s was not abated; and the linens found their way
into France, either by contraband trade, or by contract with
the French Ea&s;t India Company.</P>

The traveller who enters Switzerland at Schaff|hau&s;en, and quits it at Geneva or Neu|chatel, will perhaps find this itinerary from Zuric to Ba&s;le, Bienne, Soleure, and thence to Berne and Lucerne, more convenient than that from Zuric immediately to Zug and Lucerne; while tho&s;e who quit Switz|erland at Ba&s;le will prefer the latter.</NOTE>, and walked to Albis, a
&s;mall village about three leagues di&s;tant, &s;ituated

who are attracted by the variety and extent of the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>WE fortunately e&s;caped a violent &s;hower of rain, accom|panied
with a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, which had
threatened for &s;ome time, and began immediately upon our
arrival: but we were well hou&s;ed; and our ho&s;t gave us a
good &s;upper and an excellent bottle of Mu&s;cat wine. We
were abroad this morning by five, and had a very agreeable
walk to Zug; the weather, which had of late been very &s;ul|try,
being cooled by the lightning and rain. We pa&s;&s;ed
over the field of battle at Cappel, where Zuingle was &s;lain;
regretting this in&s;tance of di&s;union between the Swi&s;s repub|lics,
<PB N="196" REF="218">
and lamenting the premature death of that great re|former,
who was killed in the 48th year of his age. We
pur&s;ued our journey through a plea&s;ant country, &s;o thickly
planted with fruit-trees, that I could hardly di&s;tingui&s;h any
other &s;ort. Indeed, we had before remarked the prodigious
number of fruit-trees in &s;everal other parts of Switzer|land;
the country being in many places almo&s;t a continued
orchard.</P>
<P>ZUG, the capital of this canton, &s;tands delightfully upon
the edge of a beautiful lake, in a fertile valley, abounding
with corn, pa&s;ture, and wood. This canton formerly be|longed
to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: and continued faithful to
that family, when the other neighbouring &s;tates had form|ed
them&s;elves into independent republics. As it lies between
Zuric and Schweitz, the communication between tho&s;e two
cantons was maintained with difficulty; and by this means
frequent opportunities were afforded to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria
of invading and harra&s;&s;ing the Swi&s;s. Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
the &s;ix allied cantons, in 1351, laid &s;iege to Zug, which
was re&s;olutely defended by the inhabitants; but as Albert
duke of Au&s;tria was in no condition to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, the
town at length &s;urrendered upon the mo&s;t honourable con|ditions.
The genero&s;ity of the conquerors was equal to the
courage and magnanimity of the vanqui&s;hed: for, in con|&s;equence
of this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the canton of Zug was delivered
from the yoke of a foreign ma&s;ter; obtained the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured
liberty and independence; and was admitted into the Helve|tic
Confederacy upon equal terms.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="219">
THE government of this little canton is exceedingly com|plicated;
and the inhabitants of the town have &s;omewhat
more influence, and enjoy a greater &s;hare in the admini&s;tra|tion
of affairs, than tho&s;e of the capital burghs in the five
other democratical cantons. The &s;upreme power re&s;ides in
the inhabitants of the four di&s;tricts of Zug, Bar, Egeri, and
Meutzingen; who a&s;&s;emble yearly to enact laws, and to
choo&s;e their magi&s;trates. The Landamman, reciprocally
elected from each of the four communities, is nominated by
the &s;uffrages of the whole collective di&s;tricts: he continues
three years in office, when taken from Zug, and but two
years when cho&s;en from each of the three other di&s;tricts.
The general admini&s;tration of affairs is entru&s;ted to the
council of regency, compo&s;ed of forty members: of whom
thirteen are &s;upplied by the di&s;trict of Zug, and twenty-&s;even
are &s;elected equally from the three remaining com|munities.
This council, as well as the Landamman, re&s;ides
always in the capital.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN AND CANTON OF LUCERNE&mdash;GENERAL
PFIFFER'S MODEL.</HEAD>
<P>WE took boat at Zug, and being rowed acro&s;s the lake
(which is about three leagues long, and one broad)
were landed at a village in the canton of Schweitz. From
thence we walked to Ku&s;&s;nacht; and in our way pa&s;&s;ed by a
&s;mall chapel &s;acred to William Tell, erected on the &s;pot
where, it is &s;aid, he &s;hot the Au&s;trian governor. At Ku&s;&s;|nacht,
we embarked upon the lake of Lucerne; and were
much &s;truck upon our approach with the fine &s;ituation of
that town, and the noble amphitheatre of mountains, which
border the lake.</P>
<P>LUCERNE, originally &s;ubject to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, was
expo&s;ed to the inroads of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden,
when tho&s;e cantons had &s;ecured their liberty and indepen|dence.
Her commerce to Italy was interrupted; her fairs
unfrequented; and her citizens compelled to be continually
under arms, in order to protect their territory from ince&s;&s;ant
depredations. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the Hou&s;e of Au&s;|tria
imprudently loading the citizens with additional taxes,
as exorbitant as they were unju&s;t, Lucerne made her peace
with the con&s;ederate cantons: and, having &s;oon after expel|led
the Au&s;trian party, entered into a perpetual alliance with
Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, and became a member of
the Helvetic union.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="223">
THE acce&s;&s;ion of Lucerne gave additional credit and
power to the confederacy; and enabled it, in 1386, to re&s;i&s;t
all the efforts of a great and implacable enemy. In that
year, Leopold duke of Au&s;tria invaded the canton with a
numerous army; when the combined troops gained a bloody
victory at Sempach, in which Leopold lo&s;t his life. In the
accounts of this battle, an in&s;tance of private valour is re|corded,
which would have done honour even to a Grecian or
a Roman name; and only requires the pen of a Thucydides
or a Livy to equal in &s;ame the exploits of the mo&s;t admired
heroes of antiquity. The Au&s;trian army, far &s;uperior in
number, was drawn up in firm battalion, accoutred in heavy
armour, and furni&s;hed with long pikes, which they pre&s;ent|ed
before them. The Swi&s;s troops were led to the attack in
the form of a wedge, in order to open their way into the
ranks of the enemy, and to break the &s;olidity of the bat|talion.
The Au&s;trians continued for &s;ome time impenetra|ble;
when Arnold de Winkelried ru&s;hed alone upon the
enemy to certain death; and, &s;eizing as many pikes as he
could gra&s;p, endeavoured to force through the ranks: but
he was killed in the attempt. His patriotic valour was not
exerted in vain: it inflamed the Swi&s;s with new courage,
and taught the only method of penetrating into the bat|talion;
which they at length effected, after the mo&s;t de&s;pe|rate
efforts of invincible re&s;olution.</P>
<P>LEOPOLD him&s;elf might have e&s;caped, when his troops
fir&s;t began to give way; but, with a magnanimity worthy of
a better fate, he determined, after having been a witne&s;s to
the total rout of his army, not to &s;urvive &s;o ignominious a
<PB N="201" REF="224">
day: accordingly he ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the enemy,
and was &s;lain. In the ar&s;enal of this place are &s;till pre&s;erved
his armour, together with a large quantity of cords; with
which, according to tradition, he intended to have bound the
citizens of Lucerne. The keeper of the ar&s;enal di&s;played them
with the &s;ame kind of triumph, as the man, who &s;hews the
Tower of London, points out the chains that were taken on
board of the Spani&s;h armada; which Philip the Second is
&s;aid to have de&s;tined for the principal nobility of England.</P>
<P>THE government of Lucerne is entirely ari&s;tocratical.
or rather oligarchical. The &s;overeign power re&s;ides in the
Council of one hundred, compri&s;ing the Senate or Little
Council. The former is the nominal &s;overeign; but the
whole power actually re&s;ides in the latter, con&s;i&s;ting of
thirty-&s;ix members, who are formed into two divi&s;ions,
which exerci&s;e the office by rotation. The members of
this Senate are neither confirmed by the Sovereign Coun|cil,
nor by the citizens, but are only dependent upon them|&s;elves;
the divi&s;ion which retires at the end of &s;ix months,
confirming that which comes into office. Be&s;ides, the va|cant
places in the Senate are filled by its own body; &s;o that
the power remains in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a few patrician fami|lies:
and, as the &s;on generally &s;ucceeds his father, or the
brother his brother, the &s;enatorial dignity may be con&s;ider|ed,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as hereditary.</P>
<P>THE admini&s;tration of the current affairs, the care of the
police, the management of the finances, and the whole ex|ecutive
power, re&s;ides in the Senate, which &s;its con&s;tantly;
<PB N="202" REF="225">
whereas the Sovereign Council is a&s;&s;embled only upon parti|cular
and important occa&s;ions. The Senate has cognizance
of criminal cau&s;es; but in ca&s;e of capital condemnation, the
Sovereign Council is convoked in order to pronounce the
&s;entence: a practice worthy of imitation! for the condem|nation
of a criminal cannot be too maturely weighed; and
great &s;olemnity u&s;ed in pronouncing the &s;entence, mu&s;t im|pre&s;s
a &s;trong effect upon the minds of the people. In civil
cau&s;es, an appeal lies from the Senate to the Sovereign
Council; but this mu&s;t be a mere formality: as, in fact, it is
an appeal from the &s;enators in one court to the &s;ame &s;enators
in another. Indeed, their influence over the Sovereign
Council mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be ab&s;olute: for they them&s;elves
con&s;titute above a third of that body: choo&s;e their own
members; and confer the principal charges of government.
They nominate al&s;o to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, which are
very con&s;iderable; near two-thirds of the revenues of the
canton belonging to the clergy.</P>
<P>THE chiefs of the republic are two advoyers, who are
cho&s;en from the Senate by the Sovereign Council, and are
confirmed annually. In all elections, the relations of the
candidates, to the third degree, are excluded from voting;
and neither the father and the &s;on, nor two brothers, can be
members of the Senate at the &s;ame time. Excellent in&s;titu|tions,
one &s;hould think, to prevent the too great influence of
family-connections! excellent indeed in theory, but u&s;ele&s;s
in practice: and this circum&s;tance proves, that when the
&s;pirit of the con&s;titution is purely oligarchical, any laws
enacted for the purpo&s;e of counteracting the power of the
<PB N="203" REF="226">
nobles, are mere cyphers. In &s;ome few in&s;tances, how|ever,
the authority of the nobles is controuled: for, in de|claring
war and peace, forming new alliances, or impo&s;|ing
new taxes, the citizens mu&s;t be a&s;&s;embled, and give
their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>LUCERNE being the fir&s;t in rank and power among the Ca|tholic
cantons, is the re&s;idence of the Pope's nuntio; and all
affairs relative to religion are treated in the annual diet
which a&s;&s;embles in this town, compo&s;ed of the deputies of
tho&s;e cantons. The town contains &s;carcely three thou&s;and
inhabitants; has no manufactures of any con&s;equence, and
little commerce: and with re&s;pect to learning, it no where
meets with le&s;s encouragement, and con&s;equently is no
where le&s;s cultivated. What a contra&s;t to Zuric! Yet, under
the&s;e di&s;advantages, a few per&s;ons have made no incon&s;ider|able
progre&s;s in literature. Among the&s;e the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous
is Mr. Baltha&s;ar, member of the Senate: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a
library that is rich in books relative to the hi&s;tory of Swit|zerland,
in which he is extremely conver&s;ant; and the pub|lications
which he has already given to the world, and tho&s;e
which he is now preparing for the pre&s;s, prove that he
knows how to u&s;e them. His works are, for the mo&s;t part,
in the German and Latin tongues; they contain biographical
aneodotes of &s;everal illu&s;trious Swi&s;s; elucidate various im|portant
parts in the general hi&s;tory of Switzerland; but more
particularly relate to the canton of Lucerne. His &s;on, a
member of the Great Council, de&s;erves to be mentioned for
his collection of Engli&s;h books; and the zeal with which he
endeavours to propagate a knowledge of our literature. I
<PB N="204" REF="227">
have al&s;o no le&s;s &s;atisfaction in adding, that, &s;ince my fir&s;t
expedition into the&s;e parts, &s;cience is more cultivated; that
the principles of toleration are better under&s;tood and more
widely diffu&s;ed; and that a literary &s;ociety is e&s;tabli&s;hed for
the promotion of polite learning. The population of the
canton has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed within this century: a
&s;ure proof of a mild and equitable government. The inha|bitants
are, as I am informed, almo&s;t totally engaged in agri|culture.
The &s;outhern parts of the canton are chiefly
mountainous, and furni&s;h for exportation cattle, hides,
chee&s;e, and butter. The northern di&s;trict is fruitful in
corn; the crops of which being more than &s;ufficient for the
con&s;umption of the whole canton, there is a con&s;tant expor|tation
of this article from the weekly market held in the
town, to which the inhabitants of the neighbouring demo|cratical
cantons re&s;ort, in order to purcha&s;e that and other
nece&s;&s;aries in which their own country is deficient. This
commerce, which, together with the pa&s;&s;age of the merchan|di&s;e
for Italy, is the chief &s;upport of the town, might be ex|ceedingly
improved and augmented, con&s;idering its advan|tageous
&s;ituation: for the Reu&s;s i&s;&s;ues from the lake, pa&s;&s;es
through the town: and, having joined the Aar, falls into the
Rhine.</P>
<P>THE cathedral and the Je&s;uits church, are the only pub|lic
buildings worthy of ob&s;ervation; but they are too much
loaded with rich ornaments, and di&s;graced by bad paintings.
In the cathedral is an organ of a &s;ine tone, and of an extra|ordinary
&s;ize: of the latter you may judge by the dimen|&s;ions
of the center pipe; which, as the prie&s;t a&s;&s;ured me, is
<PB N="205" REF="228">
forty feet in length, near three in breadth, and weighs
eleven hundred pounds. The bridges which &s;kirt the town,
round the edge of the lake, are the fa&s;hionable walks of the
place, and remarkable for their length. Being covered at
top, and open at the &s;ides, they afford a con&s;tant view of this
delightful and romantic country. They are decorated with
coar&s;e paintings, repre&s;enting the hi&s;tories of the Old Te&s;ta|ment,
the battles of the Swi&s;s, and the dance of Death.</P>
<P>UPON our arrival at Lucerne, we &s;ent a letter of recom|mendation
to General Pfiffer, a native of this town, and an
officer in the French &s;ervice. He received us immediately,
with his u&s;ual civility, and &s;hewed us his topographical re|pre&s;entation
of the mo&s;t mountainous part of Switzerland,
which well de&s;erves the accurate attention of the curious
traveller. It is a model in relief; and what was fini&s;hed
in 1776, compri&s;ed about &s;ixty &s;quare leagues, in the cantons
of Lucerne, Zug, Berne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden.
The model was twelve feet long, and nine and a half broad.</P>
<P>THE compo&s;ition is principally a ma&s;tic of charcoal, lime,
clay, a little pitch, with a thin coat of wax; and is &s;o hard as
to be trod upon without receiving the lea&s;t damage. The
whole is painted with different colours, repre&s;enting the ob|jects
as they exi&s;t in nature. It is worthy of particular ob|&s;ervation,
that not only the woods of oak, beech, pine, and
other trees, are di&s;tingui&s;hed; but al&s;o that the &s;trata of the
&s;everal rocks are marked; each being &s;haped upon the &s;pot,
and formed with granite, gravel, calcareous &s;tone, or &s;uch
<PB N="206" REF="229">
other natural &s;ub&s;tances as compo&s;e the original mountains.
The plan is indeed &s;o minutely exact, that it compri&s;es not
only all the mountains, lakes, rivers, towns, villages, and
fore&s;ts; but every cottage, every torrent, every bridge,
every road, and even every path is di&s;tinctly and accurately
repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>GENERAL PFIFFER has already been employed in this
work about ten years, with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing patience
and a&s;&s;iduity: he has him&s;elf made the plans upon the &s;pots,
taken the elevations of the mountains, and laid them down
in their &s;everal proportions. In the pro&s;ecution of this la|borious
performance, he has been twice arre&s;ted for a &s;py;
and in the popular cantons has frequently been forced to
work by moon-light, in order to avoid the jealou&s;y of the
pea&s;ants, who think their liberty would be endangered,
&s;hould &s;o exact a plan be taken of their country. As he is
obliged to remain &s;ome time upon the tops of the Alps,
where no provi&s;ion can be procured; he generally carries
with him a few &s;he-goats, who&s;e milk &s;upplies him with
nouri&s;hment. Indeed his per&s;everance in &s;urmounting all
the difficulties, that nece&s;&s;arily have ari&s;en in the cour&s;e of
this undertaking, is almo&s;t inconceivable. When he has
&s;ini&s;hed any particular part, he &s;ends for the pea&s;ants and
<HI>cha&s;&s;eurs</HI> who re&s;ide near the &s;pot, and bids them examine
accurately each mountain; whether it corre&s;ponds, as far as
the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;cale will admit, with its natural ap|pearance:
then, by frequently retouching, he corrects the
deficiencies. He takes his elevations from the level of the
<PB N="207" REF="230">
lake of Lucerne; which, according to Mr. de Sau&s;&s;ure, is
about fourteen hundred and eight feet above the Mediter|ranean.</P>
<P>THIS model, exhibiting the mo&s;t mountainous parts of
Switzerland, conveys a &s;ublime picture of immen&s;e alps
piled one upon another: as if the &s;tory of the Titans were
realized, and they had &s;ucceeded (at lea&s;t in one &s;pot of the
globe) in heaping O&s;&s;a upon Pelion, and Olympus upon O&s;&s;a.
The general informed me, that the tops of the alps which
cro&s;&s;ed Switzerland in the &s;ame line, are nearly of the &s;ame
level; or, in other words, that there are continued chains of
mountains of the &s;ame elevation, ri&s;ing in progre&s;&s;ion to the
highe&s;t range; and from thence as gradually de&s;cending to|wards
Italy.</P>
<P>THE general is exceedingly polite and affable to &s;trangers,
and ever ready to be of any &s;ervice to travellers, in pointing
out the be&s;t roads, and in acquainting them with the places
mo&s;t worthy of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>NEAR Lucerne is Mount Pilate, formerly called Mons <HI>Pi|lcatus,</HI>
from the Latin word <HI>pilea;</HI> its top being generally
covered with a cloud or cap. This word has been corrupted
into <HI>Pilatus;</HI> and from this alteration a thou&s;and ridiculous
&s;tories have been invented; among others, that Pontius Pi|late,
after having condemned our Saviour to death, was
&s;eized with remor&s;e; made an excur&s;ion into Switzerland;
and drowned him&s;elf in a lake, which is at the top of that
<PB N="208" REF="231">
mountain. This corruption of a word, and the ab&s;urd le|gend
fabricated from its alteration, will naturally remind you
of &s;everal fables of &s;imilar ab&s;urdity, which are &s;eriou&s;ly re|lated
by the Greek writers: a circum&s;tance which my very
worthy and learned friend Mr. Bryant, has &s;o amply and
ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, in his <HI>Analy&s;is of antient Mythology.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vi&s;its to Lucerne, ob&s;erved
the progre&s;s of General Pfiffer's model, and in Augu&s;t 1786
&s;een it finally completed, I am enabled to add the following
particulars, partly from my own ob&s;ervation, and partly
communicated by the ingenious arti&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE model is compo&s;ed of a hundred and forty-two
compartments of different &s;izes and forms: they are re&s;pec|tively
numbered; and the whole can be taken to pieces and
united with almo&s;t as much ea&s;e (if we may compare great
things with &s;mall) as the diffected maps, by which children
are in&s;tructed in geography.</P>
<P>THE lake of Lucerne, nearly the center of Switzerland,
forms al&s;o the center of the plan, which lays down part of
the circumjacent cantons of Zuric, Zug, Schweitz, Under|walden,
Lucerne, and Berne, and a &s;mall portion of the
mountains of Glarus. It comprehends a &s;pace of 18 1/2
<PB N="209" REF="232">
leagues<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A league is equal to 2,288 toi&s;es, or 13,728 French feet, or 14,643 Engli&s;h feet.</NOTE> in length, and 11 in breadth; and the dimen&s;ions
of the model being 20 feet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">French feet.</NOTE> and a half in length, and 12 in
breadth; 203 1/2 &s;quare leagues are repre&s;ented on a parallelo|gram
of 246 feet; or about two Engli&s;h miles and 1/4 by a
&s;quare Engli&s;h foot. The highe&s;t point of the model from
the level of the center, is about ten inches; and as the mo&s;t
elevated mountain repre&s;ented therein ri&s;es 1475 toi&s;es, or
9440 feet, above the lake of Lucerne, at a gro&s;s calculation,
the height of an inch in the model is equivalent to about
900 feet. In regard to my&s;elf, though I received con&s;ider|able
&s;atisfaction from the fir&s;t view of this extraordinary
performance, yet I again contemplated it with much more
plea&s;ure, and &s;till greater a&s;toni&s;hment, when I was able to
trace on it many of my various expeditions, and to acknow|ledge
the &s;urpri&s;ing accuracy with which the mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous
works of nature are delineated on &s;o &s;mall a &s;cale, and
with &s;o perfect a re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>THE general began this elaborate work at the age of
fifty, and though now in the &s;eventieth year of his age,
continues his annual expeditions into the alps, with a &s;pirit
and ardour that would fatigue a much younger per&s;on. It
is no le&s;s entertaining than in&s;tructive, to hear him expa|tiate,
with an agreeable vivacity, on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting
objects, which are ob&s;erved on the model. He kindly &s;up|plied
me with the following remarks, which I tran&s;cribe
from my journal. According to a rough calculation, the
<PB N="210" REF="233">
height which &s;now u&s;ually remains during &s;ummer, may be
e&s;timated at 1360 toi&s;es, or 8704 Engli&s;h feet, above the level
of the &s;ea; and on which it never melts, at 1448, or 9264
feet. As a curious in&s;tance of divided property, he pointed
to the promontory called Kieman, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of
the lake of Zug, of which the ground belongs to Lucerne,
the timber to Zug, and the leaves to Schweitz. Among the
phaenomena of nature he mentioned the Rigi, an in&s;ulated
mountain near the lake of Lucerne, twenty-five miles in cir|cumference,
and ri&s;ing to a perpendicular height of more
than four thou&s;and feet above the &s;urface of the lake: it is
entirely compo&s;ed of gravel and pudding-&s;tone, and mu&s;t
have been formed by the waters. The Rigi joins to a &s;mall
ridge of &s;and-&s;tone running towards Schweitz.</P>
<P>MOUNT PILATE offers a mo&s;t &s;ingular curio&s;ity. At the
elevation of five thou&s;and feet, and in the mo&s;t perpendicu|lar
part of the mountain, near the pa&s;ture of Brunlen, is ob|&s;erved,
in the middle of a cavern hollowed in a black rock, a
colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, which appears to be of white &s;tone. It is the
figure of a man in drapery &s;tanding, leaning one elbow on a
pede&s;tal, with one leg cro&s;&s;ed over the other, and &s;o regu|larly
formed, that it cannot be a <HI>lu&s;us naturae.</HI> This &s;tatue
is called Dominic by the pea&s;ants, who frequently acco&s;t it
from the only place in which it can be &s;een, and when their
voices are re-echoed from the cavern, they &s;ay, in the &s;im|plicity
of their hearts, &startq;Dominic has an&s;wered us.&endq; It is
difficult to imagine by whom, or in what manner, this &s;tatue
could be placed in a &s;ituation, which has hitherto proved in|acce&s;&s;ible
to all who have endeavoured to approach it.
<PB N="211" REF="234">
About the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, Huber, a native
of Krientz, a neighbouring village, attempted to de&s;cend
into the cavern by means of ropes let down from the &s;um|mit
of the rock: he &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to gain a near view
of this &s;ingular phaenomenon, and was again drawn up in
&s;afety. On a &s;econd trial, as he was &s;u&s;pended in the air,
and was endeavouring to draw him&s;elf into the cavern by
fixing a grapple to the &s;tatue, the rope broke, and he was
da&s;hed to pieces. Since that dreadful accident no one has
ventured to repeat the experiment from the &s;ame quarter.
Another trial to penetrate to the &s;tatue was made in 1756, by
General Pfiffer and eight per&s;ons, from a &s;mall opening on
the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the mountain, in which the natives col|lect
a white &s;ub&s;tance called <HI>mond-loch,</HI> or cream of the
moon. As this opening is &s;uppo&s;ed to communicate with
the cavern, the general and his companions crept on their
hands and knees, one behind the other, and winding in the
bed of a &s;mall torrent, through &s;everal narrow pa&s;&s;ages, they
at length di&s;covered the light of the &s;un through a remote
cha&s;m; but as the di&s;tance &s;eemed very con&s;iderable, and as
the fall of a &s;ingle &s;tone might have ob&s;tructed their return,
they thought it imprudent to venture any further, and re|treated
without having effected their purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 24.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY OF ENTLIBUCH&mdash;ZOFFINGEN&mdash;LAKE OF
SEMPACH&mdash;ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my fir&s;t expedition to this country, I had no opportu|tunity
of vi&s;iting the interior parts of the canton of
Lucerne, which I afterwards traver&s;ed in 1785 and 1786. On
both tho&s;e occa&s;ions I pa&s;&s;ed from Berne to Lucerne, one
time along the high road leading through Zoffingen, Surzee,
and by the lake of Sempach; at the other, through Lange|nau,
the Emme-thal, and the valley of Entlibuch, a di&s;trict
which, though not u&s;ually frequented by travellers, yet
highly de&s;erves their attention.</P>
<P>IN the 13th century, Entlibuch was &s;ubject to the counts
of Wolhau&s;en, and came by purcha&s;e, in 1299, to the em|peror
Albert. In the following century it was held as a fief
from the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive counts; of
the&s;e the la&s;t, Peter of Torrenberg, having grievou&s;ly op|pre&s;&s;ed
the natives, they revolted, and in 1386 threw them|&s;elves
under the protection of Lucerne. That republic con|tinued
to po&s;&s;e&s;s Entlibuch, as a feudal tenure under the
Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, until 1405; when the archduke Frederic
renounced all the rights of &s;overeignty in favour of Lucerne.
For above a century and an half &s;ub&s;equent to that period,
the inhabitants, inflamed with a &s;pirit of independence, and
<PB N="213" REF="236">
excited by the example of the neighbouring popular can|tons,
frequently ro&s;e in arms, and attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h
a democracy; but without &s;ucce&s;s. Their la&s;t in&s;urrection
broke out in 1653; &s;ince which time they have continued in
a &s;tate of perfect tranquillity, under the wi&s;e admini&s;tration
of Lucerne; and have enjoyed, with contentment, the con|&s;iderable
privileges with which they are endowed.</P>
<P>THE bailliage of Entlibuch extends from the Emme-thal
in the canton of Berne, to the bridge near Werten&s;tein, about
fifteen miles in length, and nine in its greate&s;t breadth; and
contains at lea&s;t 11,000 &s;ouls. It is governed by a bailif,
who is always a &s;enator of Lucerne: he continues in office
two years, and generally re&s;ides in that capital. The inhabi|tants
enjoy con&s;iderable immunities, which they know how
to prize.</P>
<P>THE bailliage is divided into three di&s;tricts; the Upper,
or E&s;chli&s;mat; the Middle, or Shuepfen; the Lower, or
Entlibuch; each whereof has its &s;eparate courts of ju&s;tice,
from which an appeal lies to Lucerne.</P>
<P>THAT part of the bailliage which I traver&s;ed, is a valley,
watered by &s;everal lively rivulets, winding for &s;ome way
between two ridges of well-wooded hills, and abounding in
picture&s;que &s;cenery. Afterwards the country was undu|lating,
and the road, which was narrow and rugged, ran
along continual acclivities and declivities, through well-cultivated
fields of pa&s;ture. I pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal villages,
of which the principal were E&s;chli&s;mat, Shuepfen, and En|tlibuch,
<PB N="214" REF="237">
which takes its name from the rivulet Entle, and
gives it to the whole di&s;trict. The&s;e places are &s;mall; but
the whole country is &s;trewed with cottages, and &s;eems a
continued village. The inhabitants chiefly follow agricul|ture;
they rear large quantities of horned cattle, &s;heep,
goats, and &s;wine; make and export chee&s;es in great abun|dance.
Though u&s;ually richer than the inhabitants in the
other parts of the canton, yet they did not appear &s;o well
clothed, or to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch neat cottages, as their neighbours
in the Emme-thal. The pea&s;ants of Entlibuch are much
e&s;teemed for their independent &s;pirit, vigour, and &s;trength;
remarkable for keenne&s;s and vivacity, for great quickne&s;s in
repartee, for a peculiarity of garb, and for many &s;triking
cu&s;toms which di&s;tingui&s;h them from the natives of the
circumjacent di&s;tricts. Of various u&s;ages, which e&s;caped my
notice during my &s;hort &s;tay among them, I chanced to gain
information of one cu&s;tom, which reminds me of the <HI>Fe&s;cen|nina
Licentia</HI> mentioned by Horace, that prevailed among
the Roman pea&s;ants. Two neighbouring pari&s;hes &s;end a
challenge to each other; and, at the conclu&s;ion of the car|nival,
each di&s;patches a man, <HI>bedizened</HI> with flowers and
&s;hells, called <HI>&s;hrove-monday-emba&s;&s;ador;</HI> who rides to the
neighbouring village, and reads, or rather &s;ings, two &s;atiri|cal
compo&s;itions in ver&s;e: the one, a general &s;atire again&s;t
the pari&s;h, u&s;ually begins by celebrating a period of Swi&s;s
hi&s;tory accommodated to the circum&s;tances of time and
place; then draws a compari&s;on between the two pari&s;hes,
giving the preference to his own, either for the &s;uperior
learning and piety of the prie&s;t, the wi&s;dom and impartiality
of the pre&s;ident, the indu&s;try and &s;pirit of the men, the
<PB N="215" REF="238">
beauty and cha&s;tity of the women, and the education of the
children. The &s;econd compo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;tring of
epigrams in ridicule of particular per&s;ons; in which any
&s;candalous adventures, or ludicrous circum&s;tances, which
have happened &s;ince the la&s;t year, are recorded with much
exaggeration. The poet fini&s;hes his harangue with ex|pre&s;&s;ing
a wi&s;h, that on the next Shrove-monday the inha|bitants
may improve, and not de&s;erve &s;uch a &s;evere re|primand.</P>
<P>ON the conclu&s;ion of this lecture, which creates much
laughter, the <HI>mock emba&s;&s;ador</HI> returns; and the men of the
two pari&s;hes repair, with drums beating and colours flying,
to an open place, called the <HI>Field of Battle,</HI> followed and en|couraged
by the inhabitants of their re&s;pective pari&s;hes.
When the two <HI>armies</HI> are drawn up in order of battle; the
<HI>combatants,</HI> in imitation of the old Swi&s;s cu&s;tom, fall down
upon their knees, offer up a &s;hort prayer, and &s;tart up at
the &s;ound of the trumpet. Having formed them&s;elves into
two columns of &s;everal ranks, they march arm in arm, with
uniform &s;tep and military attitude; both the foremo&s;t lines
meet in front and jo&s;tle again&s;t each other, being &s;upported
and pu&s;hed forwards by the hinder files, frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by the women, until one <HI>phalanx</HI> is broke. The victorious
party is dignified with the name of the <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> and tho&s;e who
gave way are called <HI>Au&s;trians,</HI> in allu&s;ion to the antient ani|mo&s;ity
between tho&s;e two powers. The jurymen of the
di&s;trict are pre&s;ent as umpires, and to prevent any violent
di&s;putes and quarrels. After the rencounter both parties
&s;it down to table, and the day is concluded with fea&s;ting.
<PB N="216" REF="239">
As tho&s;e &s;atirical compo&s;itions occa&s;ionally created much ill-will
between the two neighbouring pari&s;hes, and the ren|counters
were attended with various accidents, the govern|ment
of Lucerne aboli&s;hed the cu&s;tom; but has lately per|mitted
it to be revived, with certain re&s;trictions calculated to
prevent any future mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>THE valley of Entlibuch may be con&s;idered as one of
tho&s;e parts which unite the mild and cultivated, with the
more wild and rugged &s;cenery of Switzerland; its acclivi|ties
gradually a&s;cend and terminate in Mount Pilate, who&s;e
barren top is &s;een towering above the fertile and well-wooded
hills.</P>
<P>ON quitting this valley we cro&s;&s;ed the Emme over a co|vered
bridge, admired the romantic po&s;ition of Werten&s;tein,
a convent of Cordeliers, overhanging the perpendicular
banks of that torrent; and pa&s;&s;ed through a very &s;teep and
rocky country to Malters, a &s;mall village within a league of
the capital. Here being a con&s;iderable fair, I &s;topped and
dined at the <HI>table d' hote,</HI> in company with &s;everal gentlemen
from Lucerne. In walking through the fair, I ob&s;erved
&s;everal booths for the &s;ale of artificial flowers; which were
purcha&s;ed by the country girls. With the&s;e flowers, and
with four bows of ribbands, they ornament their hats, which
they adju&s;t obliquely, with a degree of ru&s;tic coquetry that
is not unbecoming.</P>
<P>ANOTHER di&s;trict of this canton, is that part which I
vi&s;ited in 1786, along the high road leading from Berne to
<PB N="217" REF="240">
Lucerne. I pa&s;&s;ed the night at Zoffingen, a &s;mall town in
the canton of Berne, the inhabitants whereof enjoy greater
immunities than any other place in that whole canton.
They have their own magi&s;trates; and what is peculiar, their
own courts of ju&s;tice, both civil and criminal, which decide
in the la&s;t re&s;ort, without an appeal to Berne. A bailif re|&s;ides
there; but his whole employment con&s;i&s;ts in collecting
the tythes. The town contains about two thou&s;and &s;ouls.</P>
<P>NEAR Zoffingen I entered the canton of Lucerne, and
pa&s;&s;ed through a narrow valley bounded by a chain of hills
remarkable for the richne&s;s and variety of the hanging
woods. As we proceeded the valley expanded; we traver&s;ed
a gently waving country, and de&s;cended to Surzee, a &s;mall
neat town near the lake of Sempach. From thence we
coa&s;ted the we&s;t-&s;ide of that lake, which is a &s;mall but beau|tiful
piece of water, about three miles in length, and one in
breadth. The grounds on each &s;ide &s;lope gently to the edge
of the water, and are prettily checkered with wood. On
the oppo&s;ite banks of the lake, I ob&s;erved the town of Sem|pach,
celebrated for the battle which e&s;tabli&s;hed the liberty
of the Swi&s;s; and which I have already mentioned in the
preceding letter. The anniver&s;ary of that battle, which
happened on the 9th of July, 1386, is &s;till commemorated
with great &s;olemnity, both at Sempach and Lucerne; and
&s;upplies a copious &s;ubject for many poems and ballads in the
numerous collection of national &s;ongs.</P>
<P>ON that anniver&s;ary, a large body of per&s;ons of all ranks
a&s;&s;emble on the &s;pot where the battle was fought; a prie&s;t
<PB N="218" REF="241">
a&s;cends a pulpit erected in the open air, and delivers a
thank&s;giving &s;ermon on the &s;ucce&s;sful efforts of their an|ce&s;tors
on that happy day, which en&s;ured to their country
liberty and independence. On the conclu&s;ion of this &s;er|mon,
another prie&s;t reads a de&s;cription of the battle, and
commemorates the names of tho&s;e brave Swi&s;s who gloriou&s;ly
&s;acrificed their lives in defence of their freedom. Having
exhorted tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent to pray for the &s;ouls of their
countrymen, and of the enemies, who fell in that battle;
they all repair in&s;tantly to a &s;mall chapel, where ma&s;&s;es are
&s;ung for the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed. During this &s;ervice, the
people, falling on their knees, pray for their glorious an|ce&s;tors,
either in the chapel, on who&s;e walls are painted the
deeds of the Swi&s;s who immortalized them&s;elves in this
conflict, or before four &s;tone cro&s;&s;es which di&s;tingui&s;h the
place of combat.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE LAKE OF LUCERNE&mdash;GERISAU&mdash;SCHWEITZ&mdash;ORIGIN
OF THE HELVETIC CONFEDERACY&mdash;WILLIAM
TELL&mdash;ALTDORF.</HEAD>
<P>THE Wald&s;taetter See, or the Lake of the Four Can|tons,
is, from the greatne&s;s and &s;ublimity as well as
variety of &s;cenery, perhaps the fine&s;t body of water in Swit|zerland.
The upper branch, or the lake of Lucerne, is in
the form of a cro&s;s; the &s;ides of which &s;tretch from Ku&s;&s;|nacht
to Dallenwal, a &s;mall village near Stantz. It is bound|ed
towards the town of Lucerne by cultivated hills &s;loping
gradually to the water, contra&s;ted on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide by an
enormous ma&s;s of barren and craggy rocks. Mount Pilate
ri&s;es boldly from the lake, and is perhaps one of the highe&s;t
mountains in Switzerland, if e&s;timated from its ba&s;e, and not
from the level of the &s;ea. According to General Pfiffer, its
elevation above the lake is more than &s;ix thou&s;and feet: ne|verthele&s;s
its height above the Mediterranean is trifling, in
compari&s;on with that of the alps we are going to vi&s;it; nor
indeed does the &s;now continue all the year upon its &s;ummit.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of this branch, the lake contracts into
a narrow creek &s;carcely a mile acro&s;s; &s;oon after, it again
widens, and we entered the &s;econd branch, or the lake of
Schweitz: on the we&s;tern &s;ide the canton of Underwalden,
on the ea&s;tern that of Schweitz. Here the mountains are
<PB N="220" REF="243">
more lofty, and infinitely varied: &s;ome covered to their very
&s;ummits with the mo&s;t lively verdure; others perpendicular
and craggy; here forming va&s;t amphitheatres of wood; there
jutting into the water in bold promontories.</P>
<P>ON the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this branch, is the village of Geri|&s;au,
at the foot of the Rigi: it is the &s;malle&s;t republic in
Europe. Its territory is about a league in breadth, and two
in length; &s;ituated partly on a &s;mall neck of land at the edge
of the lake, and partly lying upon the rapid declivity of the
Rigi. It contains about 1200 inhabitants: they have their
general a&s;&s;embly of burge&s;&s;es, their Landamman, their
council of regency, their courts of ju&s;tice, and their militia.
I was informed, that there is not a &s;ingle hor&s;e in the whole
territory of the republic; as indeed might well be &s;uppo&s;ed:
for the only way of arriving at the town is by water, except|ing
a narrow path down the &s;teep &s;ides of the mountain,
which is almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. Geri&s;au is entirely compo&s;ed of
&s;cattered hou&s;es and cottages of a very neat and picture&s;que
appearance. Each dwelling is provided with a field or &s;mall
garden. The inhabitants are much employed in preparing
&s;ilk for the manufactures of Ba&s;le. This little republic, is
under the protection of the four cantons, Lucerne, Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden: and in ca&s;e of war furni&s;hes its
quota of men. To the ambitious politician, who judges of
governments by extent of dominion and power, &s;uch a dimi|nutive
republic thrown into an ob&s;cure corner, and &s;carcely
known out of its own contracted territory, mu&s;t appear un|worthy
of notice; but the &s;malle&s;t &s;pot of earth on which civil
freedom is cultivated and flouri&s;hes, cannot fail to intere&s;t
<PB N="221" REF="244">
tho&s;e who know the true value of liberty and independence;
and are convinced, that political happine&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in
great opulence and exten&s;ive empire.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of this branch the lake forms a bay;
in the mid&s;t of which lies the village of Brunnen, celebrated
for the treaty, concluded, in 1315, between Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden. Here I landed, and walked through an
agreeable and fertile plain, laid out in meadows, and planted
with fruit-trees, to Schweitz, which &s;tands on the &s;lope of a
hill, at the bottom of two high, &s;harp and rugged rocks,
called the <HI>Schweitzer-Haken.</HI> Its po&s;ition is extremely
agreeable. The church, which is a large magnificent build|ing,
&s;tands in the center of the place: near it the hou&s;es are
contiguous to each other: but in the other part they are
prettily di&s;per&s;ed about the gentle acclivities, in the mid&s;t of
lawns and meadows, and &s;heltered by groves of trees. The
principal object of curio&s;ity in Schweitz, is a complete collec|tion
of the celebrated Hetlinger's medals, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his
nephew. This collection, which he inherited from his un|cle,
is very valuable, the medals being all of the fine&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions,
and &s;everal extremely rare. From the&s;e medals
Mr. de Mechel publi&s;hed his much e&s;teemed engravings, to
which he has prefixed a life of the arti&s;t, who was born in
the canton of Schweitz, on the 28th of March 1691, and died
in 1771, in a very advanced age.</P>
<P>HAVING reimbarked at Brunnen, we &s;oon entered the
third branch, or the lake of Uri; the &s;cenery of which is &s;o
grand and &s;ublime, that its impre&s;&s;ion will never be era&s;ed
<PB N="222" REF="245">
from my mind. Imagine to your&s;elf a deep and narrow
lake about nine miles in length, bordered on both &s;ides with
rocks uncommonly wild and romantic, and, for the mo&s;t part,
perpendicular; with fore&s;ts of beech and pine growing down
their &s;ides to the very edge of the water: the rocks are &s;o
entirely &s;teep and overhanging, that we &s;carcely ob&s;erved
more than four or five &s;pots, where we could have landed.
On the right-hand, upon our fir&s;t entrance, a detached piece
of rock, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore, engaged our at|tention.
This rock is wholly formed by &s;tones of the &s;ize
and &s;hape of bricks, &s;o as to appear quite artificial. The
&s;ame kind of natural ma&s;onry may be ob&s;erved in the lofty
cliffs which impend over this lake, not far from Brunnen.
It ri&s;es to about &s;ixty feet in height; is covered with under|wood
and &s;hrubs; and reminded me of tho&s;e crags that &s;hoot
up in the fall of the Rhine near Schaffhau&s;en: but here the
lake was as &s;mooth as chry&s;tal; and the dead &s;ilence and &s;o|lemn
gloom which reigned in this place, were not le&s;s awful
and affecting than the tremendous roaring of the cataract at
Schaffhau&s;en. Somewhat further, upon the highe&s;t point of
the Seeli&s;berg, we ob&s;erved a &s;mall chapel that &s;eemed inacce&s;|&s;ible;
and below it, the little village of Gruti, near which the
three heroes of Switzerland are &s;aid to have taken reciprocal
oaths of fidelity, when they planned the famous revolution.</P>
<P>ON the oppo&s;ite &s;ide appears the chapel of William Tell,
erected in honour of that hero, upon the very &s;pot where (it
is &s;aid) he leaped from the boat, in which he was conveying
as a pri&s;oner to Ku&s;&s;nacht. It is built upon a rock that pro|jects
into the lake under a hanging wood: a &s;ituation amid
<PB N="223" REF="246">
&s;cenes &s;o &s;trikingly awful, as mu&s;t &s;trongly affect even the
mo&s;t dull and torpid imagination! On the in&s;ide of this
chapel, the &s;everal actions of William Tell are coar&s;ely
painted. While we were viewing them, we ob&s;erved the
countenances of our watermen gli&s;tening with exultation,
and they related to us, with much &s;pirit and &s;en&s;ibility, the
cruelties and tyranny of Ge&s;ler, governor of Uri, and the in|trepid
behaviour of their glorious deliverer. Indeed I have
frequently remarked with plea&s;ure, the national enthu&s;ia&s;m
which &s;o generally prevails in this country; and have great|ly
admired the fire and animation with which the people
di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e famous men among their ance&s;tors, to
whom they are indebted for that happy &s;tate of indepen|dence
which they now enjoy. This laudable &s;pirit is con|tinually
&s;upported and encouraged by the number of &s;tatues,
and other memorials, of the antient Swi&s;s heroes, which are
&s;o common in every town and village throughout Switzer|land.
Among the&s;e, Tell is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, and he
&s;eems to be the peculiar favourite of the common people:
the rea&s;on is obvious; for his &s;tory partakes greatly of the
marvellous.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago a treati&s;e, entitled <HI>Fable Danoi&s;e</HI> was
publi&s;hed at Berne; in which the author calls in que&s;tion
the hi&s;tory of William Tell. Tho' his arguments in general
are by no means conclu&s;ive; yet he mentions two circum|&s;tances
which, if true, are convincing proofs, that much
fiction is interwoven with the whole account: for, the
author a&s;&s;erts that the incident of Tell's &s;hooting the apple
from the head of his &s;on, is not recorded in any of the con|temporary
<PB N="224" REF="247">
hi&s;torians, although they give the minute&s;t ac|counts
of the governor's tyranny; and that the fir&s;t writer
who takes notice of it, is Petermann Etterlin of Lucerne,
who lived in the latter end of the fifteenth century, near
two hundred years after the fact is &s;uppo&s;ed to have hap|pened.
Be&s;ides, a &s;tory of the &s;ame kind is related in the
Dani&s;h annals by Saxo Grammaticus, with &s;carcely any dif|ference
but that of names: Harold king of Denmark &s;up|plies
the place of the governor of Uri; and Tocco that of
William Tell; and this event, which is &s;aid to have hap|pened
in 965, is attended al&s;o with nearly the &s;ame incidents
as tho&s;e recorded in the Swi&s;s accounts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As Saxo Grammaticus is an author but little known, and the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;|tion is exceedingly curious; the reader will find it in&s;erted at the end of this vo|lume. It is but ju&s;tice to add, that &s;ome per&s;ons que&s;tion the authenticity of this pa&s;|&s;age, and &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;purious.</NOTE>. Neverthele&s;s, it
is far from being a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that, becau&s;e the
authenticity of the &s;tory concerning the apple is liable to
&s;ome doubts; <HI>therefore</HI> the whole tradition relating to Tell
is fabulous. Neither is it a proof again&s;t the reality of a
fact, that it is not mentioned by any contemporary hi&s;to|rians.
The general hi&s;tory of William Tell is repeatedly
celebrated in &s;everal old German &s;ongs, &s;o remarkable for
their antient dialect and &s;implicity, as almo&s;t to rai&s;e the
deeds they celebrate above all rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picion: add to
this, the con&s;tant tradition of the country, together with two
chapels erected &s;ome centuries ago, in memory of his ex|ploits.
The three cantons were &s;o much offended with the
author for throwing any doubt upon the exploits of their
antient hero, that they pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the &s;o|vereign
<PB N="225" REF="248">
council of Berne: and the pamphlet was publicly
burnt at Uri. In this in&s;tance their national prejudices (if
they really de&s;erve that name) become, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
meritorious and re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>UPON our landing at Fluellen, I had an opportunity of
ob&s;erving that the cro&s;s-bow is &s;till much u&s;ed in the&s;e parts,
as I &s;aw &s;everal very young boys, each with that in&s;trument
in his hand. Ob&s;erving a butt at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the
place, I gave them to under&s;tand, that tho&s;e who hit the
mark &s;hould receive a penny for their dexterity. Upon this
intimation, three boys took aim &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, two of whom
touched the very center of the butt, and obtained the prize:
but, the third mi&s;&s;ing, I made him &s;hoot till he hit the
mark; which, after two or three trials, he at length per|formed.</P>
<P>FROM Fluellen we walked to Altdorf, the capital burgh
of the canton of Uri, &s;ituated in a narrow vale almo&s;t en|tirely
&s;urrounded by &s;tupendous mountains. It contains &s;e|veral
neat hou&s;es; the tops whereof are covered with large
&s;tones, in order to prevent the roofs being carried away by
tho&s;e violent hurricanes which are frequent in the&s;e moun|tainous
countries.</P>
<P>WHEN the greate&s;t part of Helvetia was &s;ubject to the
empire; the inhabitants of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden,
had long enjoyed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable privileges, particu|larly
the right of being governed by their own magi&s;trates:
the clergy and many of the nobles, indeed, had &s;iefs and
<PB N="226" REF="249">
&s;ubjects in tho&s;e re&s;pective territories; but the bulk of the
people formed &s;everal communities almo&s;t totally indepen|dent.
During the twelfth century, various di&s;putes between
the&s;e three cantons and the emperors, united them more
firmly than ever; and they were accu&s;tomed, every ten
years, to renew formally their alliance. Such was their
&s;ituation at the death of Frederick II. In 1250. From this pe|riod,
or &s;oon afterwards, commences the interregnum in the
empire: during which time of anarchy and confu&s;ion, the
nobles and bi&s;hops endeavouring to extend their power, and
to encroach upon the privileges of the people; Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden, put them&s;elves under the protection of
Rhodolph of Hap&s;burgh, who, in 1273, being cho&s;en em|peror,
terminated the interregnum. Rhodolph received a
&s;mall revenue from the&s;e cantons, and appointed a governor,
who had cognizance in all criminal cau&s;es: the rights,
however, and privileges of the people were expre&s;sly re|&s;erved.</P>
<P>RHODOLPH, &s;ome time after his acce&s;&s;ion to the imperial
throne, li&s;tened to the ambitious &s;chemes of his &s;on Albert,
who was de&s;irous to form Helvetia into a dutchy. For this
purpo&s;e the emperor purcha&s;ed the domains of &s;everal ab|beys,
and other con&s;iderable fiefs in Switzerland, as well in
the canton of Schweitz as in the neighbouring territories.
The three cantons, induced by the great increa&s;e of power,
which the emperor gained by this acqui&s;ition, prudently re|newed
their alliance, and obtained a confirmation of their
privileges: which, upon the death of Rhodolph, was con|firmed
by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Adolphus of Na&s;&s;au. But when Al|bert
<PB N="227" REF="250">
was afterwards elected emperor, he refu&s;ed to ratify
their rights: and, in order totally to &s;ubdue the people,
placed over them two governors, who were guilty of many
flagitious acts of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances Werner de Staffach of
Schweitz, Walther Fur&s;t of Uri, and Arnold de Melchthal of
Underwalden, planned the famous revolution, which took
place January 13, 1308, and re&s;tored liberty to the three can|tons.
Albert, while he was preparing to attack them, was
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his nephew John of Hap&s;burgh<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 14.</NOTE>. In 1315,
Leopold duke of Au&s;tria marched again&s;t the confederate
cantons, at the head of twenty thou&s;and troops, and, endea|vouring
to force his way into Schweitz at the &s;treights of
Morgarten, received a total defeat from thirteen hundred
Swi&s;s, who were po&s;ted upon the mountains. If we may be|lieve
contemporary hi&s;torians, the Swi&s;s lo&s;t but fourteen
men in this memorable engagement, which in&s;ured their
independence. In the &s;ame year, the three cantons con|tracted
a perpetual alliance, which was ratified at Brunnen;
and is the grand foundation of the Helvetic Confederacy.
Such were the feeble beginnings of a league, &s;ince become
&s;o formidable by the acce&s;&s;ion of ten more cantons, and by
the additional &s;trength of its numerous allies: and it is re|markable,
that Switzerland is the only country which, on the
one &s;ide, has con&s;ined the limits of the German empire;
and, on the other, has &s;et bounds to the French monarchy,
which the latter has never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.
<PB N="228" REF="251">
THE name of Schweitzerland, or Switzerland, which
originally comprehended only the three cantons of Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden, was afterwards extended to
all Helvetia. It derived that appellation either from the
canton of Schweitz, as having particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf
in the revolution of 1308, and al&s;o at the battle of Morgar|ten;
or becau&s;e the Au&s;trians called all the inhabitants of
the&s;e mountainous parts, by the general denomination of
Schweitzers.</P>
<P>SWITZERLAND was the rock on which the Hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria
&s;plit, during more than a century. Blinded with re|&s;entment
again&s;t their former &s;ubjects, and anxious to reco|ver
their lo&s;t domains; the &s;everal dukes led in per&s;on con|&s;iderable
armies to &s;ubdue a nation, who&s;e &s;pirit was uncon|querable;
and to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a country, which,
from its &s;ituation, was ea&s;ily defended by a handful of men
again&s;t the mo&s;t numerous troops. Within the period
above-mentioned, they neglected &s;everal opportunities of
aggrandizing them&s;elves in other parts; and, &s;lighting
what was more fea&s;ible, bent their whole efforts to acquire
what in its very nature was unattainable. The con&s;equence
of this mi&s;taken policy, was, a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of de|feats,
attended with a prodigious expence, and the lo&s;s of
their brave&s;t troops: until at length, convinced of their
error, they totally relinqui&s;hed an attempt, in which they had
expended &s;o much fruitle&s;s blood and trea&s;ure. But al|though
&s;everal emperors of that Hou&s;e occa&s;ionally made
alliances with the Swi&s;s cantons; yet it was not till the treaty
of We&s;tphalia in 1648, that their independence was fully
<PB N="229" REF="252">
and finally acknowledged, by Ferdinand III. and the whole
empire.</P>
<P>THE government of Uri and Schweitz is entirely demo|cratical,
and nearly the &s;ame. The &s;upreme power re&s;ides
in the people at large, who are divided into &s;everal com|munities,
from which are cho&s;en the councils of regency.
In the <HI>Lands-gemeind,</HI> or general a&s;&s;embly, the Landamman,
and the principal magi&s;trates, are elected; and every burgh|er,
at the age of fourteen, in the cantons of Uri and Under|walden;
and of fifteen in Schweitz, has a right to vote.
The councils of regency in Uri and Schweitz con&s;i&s;t each of
&s;ixty members, and re&s;ide at the capital burghs. In this
council the executive power is ve&s;ted, and from this body
the principal magi&s;trates are cho&s;en.</P>
<P>THESE two cantons contain, including their &s;ubjects,
about fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls, and in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity could
furni&s;h above twelve thou&s;and militia. All the Catholic
cantons enjoy con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idies from France. Every
burgher, at the age of fourteen, in Uri, receives annually
about &s;ix livres, or five &s;hillings; the Landamman and the
magi&s;trates more in proportion. The canton of Schweitz
being for &s;ome time di&s;contented with France, withdrew its
troops from that &s;ervice: but this year (1776) the matter has
been accommodated; and the king pays annually to every
male child of a burgher four livres, commencing from the
time of his birth.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame kind of &s;oil, and the &s;ame &s;ort of productions,
are common to the two cantons: the whole country being
<PB N="230" REF="253">
rugged and mountainous, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of pa&s;ture, rai&s;es
little corn, and has no vines. We cannot but ob&s;erve with
a&s;toni&s;hment, to what a degree of fertility the natives have
improved a land, naturally barren, and for which they
fought with as much zeal and intrepidity, as if they con|tended
for the riche&s;t plains of Sicily or A&s;ia Minor. In
the&s;e little democratical &s;tates, &s;umptuary laws are not nece&s;|&s;ary;
for, they &s;carcely know, even in idea, what luxury is.
Such indeed is the purity, or (as &s;ome perhaps would call it)
the au&s;terity of morals, which &s;till prevails among the&s;e peo|ple,
as cannot ea&s;ily be imagined by the inhabitants of great
and opulent cities: and I cannot reflect on that affectionate
patrioti&s;m which &s;o &s;trongly attaches them to their country,
without calling to mind that beautiful de&s;cription of the
Swi&s;s pea&s;ant, in Gold&s;mith's Traveller:
<Q><L>&startq;Dear is that &s;hed to which his &s;oul conforms,</L>
<L>And dear that hill which lifts him to the &s;torms:</L>
<L>And as a child, when &s;caring &s;ounds mole&s;t,</L>
<L>Clings clo&s;e and clo&s;er to the mother's brea&s;t;</L>
<L>So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind's roar,</L>
<L>But bind him to his native mountains more.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>EVERY &s;tep we now advance is treading, as it were, upon
&s;acred ground; monuments continually occurring of tho&s;e
memorable battles, by which the Swi&s;s re&s;cued them&s;elves
from oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ecured the enjoyment of their inva|luable
freedom. I am now indeed in the very center of civil
liberty; would I could add of religious too! but the church
of Rome is here exclu&s;ively e&s;tabli&s;hed. It mu&s;t be acknow|ledged,
however, that this intolerant &s;pirit is not wholly con|fined
<PB N="231" REF="254">
to the Catholic cantons; for, in tho&s;e where the Pro|te&s;tants
prevail, Calvini&s;m is alone admitted: and thus a na|tion,
who prides her&s;elf upon her freedom, denies the free
exerci&s;e of religion to every other &s;ect except that which
predominates. Is not this &s;triking at the fir&s;t principle, and
mo&s;t valuable privilege, of genuine liberty?</P>
<P>LONG as my letter already is, I cannot forbear mention|ing
a peculiar cu&s;tom ob&s;erved in &s;ome of the&s;e democratical
&s;tates: every per&s;on who is cho&s;en for a bailliage, or any lu|crative
office, is obliged to pay a certain &s;tipulated &s;um into
the public fund. This practice is attended with one ill con|&s;equence
at lea&s;t; as the &s;ucce&s;sful candidate is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
authori&s;ed to &s;tretch his prerogatives, in order to &s;well
the profits of his charge. Accordingly it is a general re|mark,
that in the common bailliages the bailifs, appointed
by the popular cantons, are more apt to be guilty of exac|tions
than tho&s;e of the ari&s;tocratical republics.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CANTON OF UNDERWALDEN&mdash;SARNE&mdash;SAXELEN&mdash;TOMB
AND CHARACTER OF NICHOLAS DE FLUE&mdash;STANTZ&mdash;ENGELBERG&mdash;PASSAGE
OVER THE SU|REN
ALPS TO ALTDORF.</HEAD>
<P>INSTEAD of proceeding, as in my former tour, from
Lucerne to Altdorf by water, I made an agreeable excur|&s;ion
to Sarne, Saxclen, and Stantz, in the canton of Under|walden,
vi&s;ited the abbey of Engelberg, and traver&s;ed the
Suren Alps to Altdorf.</P>
<P>HAVING di&s;patched my baggage by water to Altdorf, I
walked, in company with Mr. Meyer, member of the Great
Council of Lucerne, through a plea&s;ant plain, lying between
Mount Pilate and an oppo&s;ite ridge of hills, to Winke, a vil|lage
&s;ituated on an inlet of the lake of Lucerne. There I
took boat, and rowing acro&s;s the inlet, di&s;embarked near
Alpnach, in the canton of Underwalden, and continued along
a foot-way, which winds through enclo&s;ures of rich pa&s;ture|land,
brow&s;ed by numerous herds of fine cattle, and prettily
checkered with &s;cattered cottages. Having cro&s;&s;ed a &s;mall
river, I arrived at Sarne, the capital burgh of that divi&s;ion of
the canton called Oberwalden, wherein the <HI>Land-rath,</HI> or
&s;upreme court of judicature, a&s;&s;embles for the purpo&s;e of
deciding civil and criminal proce&s;&s;es. This tribunal is com|po&s;ed
of fifty-eight judges, who are cho&s;en by the people,
<PB N="233" REF="256">
and continue in office for life. In criminal affairs of any
notoriety, each of the&s;e fifty-eight is empowered to bring
into court two individuals; and this whole tribunal, thus
con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred and &s;eventy-four members, a&s;&s;embles
in a large open hall in the town-hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;es final &s;en|tence.</P>
<P>AT Sarne I embarked upon the Aa, and a&s;cending its
&s;tream, entered the lake of Sarne: this piece of water, about
three miles long, and one and a half broad, is plea&s;antly en|clo&s;ed
between the mountains, and its ri&s;ing borders are
richly variegated with pa&s;tures and trees. I landed at Saxe|len,
which &s;tands on its we&s;tern &s;hore; a neat village much
frequented in the&s;e parts, as being the native place of the
celebrated &s;aint and patriot Nicholas de Flue, to who&s;e ho|nour
a church has been lately erected at a con&s;iderable ex|pence.
The interior is ornamented in a plea&s;ing &s;tyle of ar|chitecture.
Ten elegant columns of black marble &s;upport the
roof: they are about twenty-four feet in height, and many
of them are of a &s;ingle piece. They were hewn out of a
quarry in the Melchthal, about nine miles from Saxelen, and
were dragged from thence by the pea&s;ants, who voluntarily
performed this ta&s;k, which they con&s;idered as an act of reli|gious
duty: a laborious enterpri&s;e, to convey &s;uch heavy
burdens down &s;teep precipices and over rugged pathle&s;s rocks,
where they could neither be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by hor&s;es or oxen!</P>
<P>UNDER a gla&s;s-ca&s;e in the mid&s;t of this church, are de|po&s;ited
the bones of this favourite object of national wor&s;hip,
fanta&s;tically ornamented, according to the Roman Catholic
<PB N="234" REF="257">
cu&s;tom, with gold and precious &s;tones. His real burial place
is &s;till to be &s;een in a &s;mall adjoining chapel: it is a &s;imple
grave-&s;tone, on which his figure is coar&s;ely carved in &s;tone,
the work of the age in which he lived. At a &s;mall height
over this ancient monument, is placed another grave-&s;tone,
bearing al&s;o his figure, executed in later times, le&s;s rude, but
&s;till of coar&s;e workman&s;hip. On entering this chapel, I ob|&s;erved
numerous pilgrims of both &s;exes, who were kneeling
before his tomb, and praying with the greate&s;t fervency.
Many, in the ardour of devotion, threw them&s;elves between
the two grave-&s;tones, and &s;tretching them&s;elves upon the
mo&s;t antient figure, repeatedly ki&s;&s;ed and embraced it.</P>
<P>NICHOLAS de Flue, this object of national enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
was born at Saxelen in 1417. De&s;cended from an
antient family, he &s;ignalized him&s;elf in defence of his
country, and particularly during the war which the Swi&s;s
&s;upported again&s;t Sigi&s;mond archduke of Au&s;tria. He was
no le&s;s remarkable for humanity than valour. He remon|&s;trated
to his countrymen preparing to pillage and burn the
convent of St. Margaret near Die&s;&s;enho&s;en. He exclaimed:
&startq;If God grants you the victory over your enemies, u&s;e it
with moderation; and &s;pare tho&s;e edifices which are con|&s;ecrated
to him.&endq; This remon&s;trance was attended with
effect, and the convent was &s;aved from de&s;truction. To the
mo&s;t excellent qualities of the heart and under&s;tanding, to
great political &s;agacity he added the exterior graces of figure,
dignity of character, and the mo&s;t winning affability of
manners. Rai&s;ed by his countrymen to &s;everal high em|ployments
in the &s;tate, he repeatedly declined the office of
<PB N="235" REF="258">
landamman from motives of delicacy, becau&s;e he di&s;approv|ed
the principles of the governing party. At length,
hurried away by his dete&s;tation of evil, and a zeal for
monki&s;h devotion, he quitted his family in the fiftieth year
of his age, and retiring from the world, in a $it of gloomy
&s;uper&s;tition turned hermit. The place of his retreat was at
Ranft, a few miles from Saxelen; there he built an her|mitage
and a &s;mall chapel, and practi&s;ed all the &s;everities
required by that au&s;tere mode of life with the &s;tricte&s;t ob|&s;ervance.</P>
<P>BUT the flame of patrioti&s;m, although &s;mothered in his
brea&s;t by an ill-directed zeal for mi&s;taken duties, was not
extingui&s;hed; and he was the happy in&s;trument in re&s;toring
Switzerland from the impending horrors of civil di&s;cord.
At the conclu&s;ion of the war with Charles the Bold, Fri|burgh
and Soleure contracted an alliance with Zuric, Berne,
and Lucerne. This treaty being con&s;idered by Uri, Schweitz,
Underwalden, Zug, and Glarus, as a breach of the former
union, tho&s;e five cantons refu&s;ed to receive them. After
various di&s;putes and fruitle&s;s conferences, the deputies of
the eight confederate cantons a&s;&s;embled, in 1481, at Stantz,
in order to compromi&s;e the differences.</P>
<P>BOTH &s;ides were &s;o heated with mutual animo&s;ities,
that the deputies were on the point of &s;eparating without
effecting a reconciliation, and a civil war appeared inevita|ble.
In this cri&s;is of affairs, de Flue no &s;ooner heard, in
the depth of his &s;olitude, of tho&s;e public di&s;&s;entions which
threatened a fatal rupture between the confederate cantons,
<PB N="236" REF="259">
than his patrioti&s;m prevailed over his &s;uper&s;tition; and he
quitted his unprofitable hermitage, in order to exert tho&s;e
active and public virtues, the very lowe&s;t of which &s;ingly
outweighs whole years of u&s;ele&s;s and unrequired mortifica|tions.
Accordingly this extraordinary man, having, in the
64th year of his age, travelled during the night, arrived at
Stantz on the very morning in which the deputies were
preparing for their departure. He earne&s;tly conjured them
to remain; and, having prevailed upon them once more to
a&s;&s;emble, he &s;o forcibly repre&s;ented to them the de&s;tructive
con&s;equences which would attend their di&s;union, that they
cho&s;e him arbiter of the di&s;pute. By his &s;ole mediation all
differences between the contending parties were amicably
adju&s;ted; and Friburgh and Soleure were, by his advice, in|&s;tantly
received into the Helvetic Confederacy: &s;uch was the
effect of his per&s;ua&s;ive and conciliatory eloquence! Having
thus happily compo&s;ed the public di&s;&s;en&s;ions, he returned to
his hermitage, where he died, in 1487, in the 70th year of
his age, regretted and e&s;teemed by all Switzerland. Such
a general opinion of his extreme piety prevailed among
his contemporaries, that the bigotry of tho&s;e times a&s;|cribed
to him an exemption from the common wants of
humanity.</P>
<P>IN the regi&s;ter of the church of Saxelen, the following
notice is in&s;cribed for 1485, the year antecedent to his death.
&startq;In 1417, Nicholas de Flue, a &s;aint, was born in the
pari&s;h of Saxelen; who afterwards retired into a de&s;art
called Ran&s;t, where God &s;u&s;tained him during eighteen
years, without eating or drinking for a long time, namely,
<PB N="237" REF="260">
when this was written; and he is now in good e&s;tate, and
of holy life.&endq;</P>
<P>ON his tomb is in&s;cribed the following epitaph: &startq;Ni|cholas
de Flue quitted his wife and children to go into
the de&s;ert; he &s;erved God nineteen years and a half with|out
taking any &s;u&s;tenance. He died 1487.&endq; This frivo|lous
epitaph &s;trongly marks the bigotted &s;pirit of that dark
age in which it was compo&s;ed: the narrow-minded author,
totally overlooking the patriot in the hermit, &s;aw nothing
&s;o truly meritorious in the life of the decea&s;ed, as his having
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;ocial and public energies which dignify
human nature, in order to practi&s;e the deba&s;ing au&s;terities of
a &s;uper&s;titious religioni&s;t.&mdash;He ought to have in&s;cribed,
&startq;To the memory of Nicholas de Flue, who quitted his her|mitage
to appear again in the world; re&s;tored peace and
harmony to the republics of Switzerland, and &s;erved God
by &s;erving his country.&endq;</P>
<P>FROM Saxelen we intended to have vi&s;ited Ranft, de
Flue's hermitage, and from thence to have proceeded down
the Melchthal and over the mountains to Engelberg; but
as the evening was already beginning to clo&s;e, we dur&s;t not
venture along &s;o difficult a pa&s;&s;age, which would have em|ployed
us at lea&s;t five hours; we thought it, therefore, mo&s;t
prudent to continue our route towards Stantz. We fol|lowed
the foot-paths, which wind agreeably, &s;ometimes
through fore&s;ts, &s;ometimes over the fields and meadows; and
pa&s;&s;ed through a fertile but wilder and more romantic part
of the canton, than that which we traver&s;ed in the morning.
<PB N="238" REF="261">
We continued for &s;ome way at the foot of the Stantzberg,
cro&s;&s;ed a &s;mall plain that was formerly a lake, in which
&s;taples for mooring ve&s;&s;els are occa&s;ionally di&s;covered; and,
in about three hours after our departure from Saxelin, ar|rived
at Stantz, in the du&s;k of the evening.</P>
<P>ABOUT three miles from Stantz is a &s;mall wood called
the <HI>Kern-wald,</HI> which we pa&s;&s;ed through in our route from
Saxelen: it would not have been worthy of mention, if it
did not &s;eparate the canton into two divi&s;ions, called<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Above the wood, and Below the wood; <HI>wald</HI> in German &s;ignifying a wood.</NOTE> <HI>Ober|wald</HI>
and <HI>Underwald.</HI> Formerly the whole canton was under
the &s;ame general admini&s;tration; but the inhabitants of the
two di&s;tricts &s;eparating upon &s;ome di&s;pute, have &s;ince
formed two republics, and have each their <HI>lands-gemeind,</HI> or
general a&s;&s;embly, their landamman, and council of regency:
for the management of external affairs, there is a joint|council,
cho&s;en equally by the two divi&s;ions; at the Hel|vetic
Diet they &s;end but one deputy, and regulate their vote
by mutual con&s;ent.</P>
<P>STANTZ is the &s;eat of civil and criminal judicature; and
it is worthy of remark, that every male of the age of thirty
is permitted to give his vote for the acquittance or condem|nation
of a criminal. Stantz, the capital of Underwalden, is
&s;ituated in a beautiful plain of pa&s;ture, about two or three
miles in breadth, at the foot of the Stantzberg, and at a little
di&s;tance from the lake of Lucerne. The town and environs,
which are delightfully &s;prinkled with numerous cottages,
<PB N="239" REF="262">
are, for &s;o &s;mall a place, extremely populous, compri&s;ing,
perhaps, not le&s;s than five thou&s;and &s;ouls. The church is
a tolerably hand&s;ome building, and is decorated in the in&s;ide
with ten black marble pillars of large dimen&s;ions, but not
&s;o beautiful as tho&s;e at Saxelen. The women in the&s;e parts
dre&s;s their heads in a &s;ingular manner, and extremely un|becoming:
they wear black-beaver cocked hats, &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of the men, with black ears to their caps, which almo&s;t
conceal their hair.</P>
<P>THE next morning the abbot of Engelberg, having been
previou&s;ly informed of our intended vi&s;it, politely &s;ent
hor&s;es to Stantz; and we rode through a fertile valley, en|clo&s;ed
between the Stanzberg and a chain of hills, until we
arrived at Graffen-ort, a &s;mall villa belonging to the abbot,
about two leagues from Stantz. Here we began to a&s;cend
along a road winding by the &s;ide of a &s;teep precipice, and
through &startq;<HI>un&s;unned &s;ore&s;ts</HI>&endq; of beech intermingled with
poplar, mountain-a&s;h, Spani&s;h che&s;nuts, and pines, the tor|rent
Aa impetuou&s;ly foaming in a &s;tony channel, and
forming a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cataracts. The wild horrors of the
circumjacent rocks, the ince&s;&s;ant roaring of the waters, and
the &s;olitary gloom of the fore&s;t, reminded me of Gray's
beautiful Ode on the Grande Chartreu&s;e, in which he de|&s;cribes
&s;imilar &s;cenes with a &s;ublimity and truth which every
per&s;on of ta&s;te, who travels through the&s;e magnificent
regions, mu&s;t feel and admire.</P>

<P><PB N="240" REF="263">
ISSUING from the dark fore&s;t, we de&s;cended for a little
way; and unanimou&s;ly broke into an exclamation of &s;ur|pri&s;e
and delight, as we &s;uddenly looked down upon a pictu|re&s;que
plain of an oval &s;hape beautifully wooded, watered by
&s;everal lively &s;treams, enclo&s;ed within a circle of gentle hills,
and terminated by a maje&s;tic amphitheatre of &startq;<HI>cloud-capt
alps:</HI>&endq; toward the extremity of this plain, the abbey, a
large quadrangular building of &s;tone, is &s;ituated, at the foot
of the <HI>Engelberg,</HI> or Mountain of <HI>Angels,</HI> from which the
whole di&s;trict takes its name. On alighting from our hor&s;es,
the abbot politely received and conducted us into a large &s;a|loon,
where &s;oon afterwards dinner was &s;erved with all the
plenty of feudal times, and all the comforts of the pre&s;ent age.
The company at table con&s;i&s;ted of the abbot, five or &s;ix be|nedictines,
our&s;elves, and our &s;ervants, who, according to the
cu&s;tom of the place, &s;at down to the &s;ame ho&s;pitable board
with their ma&s;ters. This intermixture of &s;ociety, the polite|ne&s;s
of the worthy abbot, and the facetious cheerfulne&s;s of
one among the fathers, rendered the repa&s;t as agreeable as it
was uncommon. After dinner we vi&s;ited the library, which
contains about ten thou&s;and volumes; and, among many
rare editions, above two hundred printed in the fifteenth
century. I noticed a much larger collection of modern hi&s;|torical
and mi&s;cellaneous works, than are u&s;ually found
within the walls of a mona&s;tery; which does honour to the
ta&s;te of the abbot, and proves him to be a warm friend to
polite literature.</P>
<P>THE weather being &s;ine and clear, I &s;trayed about the
environs; admiring the &s;cattered hamlets, the beautiful tufts
<PB REF="264">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="241" REF="265">
of wood, and the lively &s;treams which murmur through the
plain: of the&s;e, one called the Melt-bach, which I ob&s;erved
i&s;&s;uing copiou&s;ly from the ground, begins to flow on the
fir&s;t melting of the &s;now in the month of May, and cea&s;es to|wards
the end of September; and the Grie&s;en-bach, that
ri&s;es at the foot of Mount Blake, runs only from mid-day to
the &s;etting &s;un. Several other torrents, that pour down
from the neighbouring glaciers, and numerous &s;prings that
bur&s;t from the ground near the abbey, help to &s;upply the
Aa, which ru&s;hes from Suren alps, and, &s;welled with the&s;e
tributary waters, ha&s;tens to throw it&s;elf into the lake of
Lucerne. The amphitheatre of cloud-capt mountains, is
formed by the Melkleberg, the Arniberg, the Blakeberg, the
Spitze-&s;tock, the Suren alps with their brown peaks boldly
ri&s;ing from the bo&s;om of the &s;now, the Engelberg towering
in naked maje&s;ty, and, the mo&s;t elevated and mo&s;t beautiful
in the whole chain, Mount Titlis, &s;upporting on its top an
immen&s;e glacier.</P>
<P>ABOUT &s;even in the afternoon we &s;at down to &s;upper; in
the mid&s;t of the repa&s;t we were &s;uddenly &s;truck with an
awful thunder-&s;torm, which, though it could not be called
the mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres, or &s;uch as, according to the legends
of the abbey, was performed on the top of the Engelberg,
by a choir of angels, at the con&s;ecration of the convent; yet
produced a mo&s;t &s;ublime effect, when re-echoed by the &s;ur|rounding
mountains.</P>
<P>THE abbot of this convent, cho&s;en by a majority of &s;ix|teen
benedictines, who compo&s;e the chapter, is &s;overeign
<PB N="242" REF="266">
lord over the land of Engelberg, a &s;mall tract of country
about &s;ixty miles in circumference, and under the protection
of Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden. The only ha|bitable
part of this di&s;trict is the &s;mall plain in which the
abbey is &s;ituated, that contains fifteen hundred &s;ouls: the
remaining portion, being entirely mountainous, affords in
&s;ummer a retreat to numerous herds of cattle. The abbot,
to whom we were indebted for &s;o polite a reception, is Leo|digar
Saltzman, a native of Lucerne, who, &s;ince his elevation
to his pre&s;ent dignity, has been a kind and indulgent ma&s;ter:
finding many of his &s;ubjects extremely poor and indolent, he
has excited them to indu&s;try; and, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t them
during the winter months, when agriculture is &s;u&s;pended,
he employs them in winding &s;ilk, which he imports from
Italy. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es very con&s;iderable power, which renders
him nearly ab&s;olute. In all criminal ca&s;es he arre&s;ts and im|pri&s;ons;
appoints the per&s;on who examines; can order, if he
thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, the infliction of torture; and can pardon
or mitigate the &s;entence given by the tribunal of the coun|try,
called <HI>land&s;gericht.</HI> In civil cau&s;es his influence is very
con&s;iderable; he appoints, from twelve candidates &s;elected
by the people, the &s;even judges, who, in conjunction with
the <HI>thalamman</HI> and <HI>&s;tathalter,</HI> form the above-mentioned
<HI>land&s;gericht,</HI> which decides in the fir&s;t re&s;ort: he can al&s;o
di&s;place them if he plea&s;es; and ab&s;olutely nominates all the
judges of the <HI>gei&s;tlichen-gericht,</HI> or eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, which
receives appeals from the deci&s;ions of the former tribunal.
His power is re&s;tricted in the following in&s;tances. If he is
engaged in a law-&s;uit with an individual, the award of the
country tribunal is final; and if with the whole community,
<PB N="243" REF="267">
the que&s;tion is decided by the four cantons of Lucerne, Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden.</P>
<P>HIS revenues amount to about &pound;. 5000; and are derived
partly from tythes of certain e&s;tates in the free bailliages of
Switzerland, from a few feudal rights, but principally from
the exportation of chee&s;es. Be&s;ide tho&s;e which are made on
the pa&s;tures belonging to the abbey, he purcha&s;es others
from the pea&s;ants of his little territory, and di&s;po&s;es of the
whole on his own account. About eighteen hundred cows,
including tho&s;e which are the property of the convent, are
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the natives of Engelberg, and annually &s;upply
cream for about 10,000 chee&s;es, each weighing from 25 to
50 pounds, and &s;elling, on an average, for fifteen florins, or
one pound five &s;hillings per hundred weight: and it may be
calculated that the abbot circulates annually to the value of
&pound;. 4000. This revenue, however, cannot be con&s;idered as
his own private property; for he pays the current expences
of the abbey.</P>
<P>SEVERAL ineffectual expeditions having been made to|wards
attaining the &s;ummit of Mount Titlis, the mo&s;t ele|vated
mountain in the&s;e parts, and perhaps &s;carcely inferior
to the Schreckhorn and Jungfrauhorn; it was for a long
time con&s;idered as inacce&s;&s;ible: but, as tradition reported,
that in the year 1739, three men had a&s;cended it, Mr. Frey|grabend,
a native of Engelberg, and phy&s;ician to the abbot,
a few days after my departure from the convent, &s;ucceeded
in a &s;imilar attempt. The following account of this expe|dition
<PB N="244" REF="268">
is extracted from a German letter, written by Frey|grabend
to a friend at Lucerne.</P>
<P>&startq;EARLY in the morning on the 14th of September,&endq; the
weather being fine and clear, I &s;et out with eleven compani|ons,
among whom were Jerom Dopler and Conrad Stocher,
two friars of the convent. About two in the morning, after
a&s;cending through Ger&s;chne, and Unter and Ober-laub, we
reached, at break of day, the &s;ummit of the Laubergrat. Here
we enjoyed a fine view over the canton of Underwalden, the
lake and canton of Lucerne, the free bailliages of Switzer|land,
and the canton of Zug. Having taken &s;ome refre&s;h|ment,
and repo&s;ed our&s;elves a quarter of an hour, we put
on our crampons, and pur&s;ued our route, eager like the
giants of old, to &s;cale the &s;teep &s;ides of Mount Faulblatten.
We continued for about an hour along the picked ridge of
this mountain, tottering by the &s;ide of tremendous preci|pices,
and twice climbing an a&s;cent almo&s;t perpendicular.
We could not ob&s;erve any trace of the &s;malle&s;t vege|tation.
Having gained the highe&s;t point of the Faulblat|ten,
we arrived at a glacier, which being fortunately co|vered
with fre&s;h &s;now, rendered the ice le&s;s &s;lippery than
u&s;ual.</P>
<P>&startq;HITHERTO our cour&s;e had been attended with &s;ome
danger, but from hence we a&s;cended, and reached, with little
difficulty, the top of the Titlis, called <HI>Nollen.</HI> But here we
were obliged to cro&s;s a deep cha&s;m, and to mount the &s;ides
of the ice, which were as perpendicular as a wall, by form|ing
<PB N="245" REF="269">
&s;teps for our feet with the iron &s;pikes of our poles: be|low
us was a valley of ice about &s;ixteen miles in length, de|&s;cending
rapidly towards Oberha&s;li. It was now about ten
in the morning, and the &s;un was extremely bright. Having
walked a few paces, the pro&s;pect was on all &s;ides open and
unbounded. This &s;ublime, yet dreary &s;cene, though it &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es
all de&s;cription, made an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind which
I &s;hall never forget.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;HERE the painter and poet would find ample and end|le&s;s
employment, if the colours of the former and the con|ceptions
of the latter could re&s;i&s;t the effects of the extreme
cold. The fir&s;t objects which caught our attention, were
the alps of the Vallais, Berne, and Savoy, with their glaciers
and vallies of ice, a maje&s;tic and tremendous &s;cene. Among
numerous mountains which ro&s;e before us, Mont-Blanc,
though at &s;ome di&s;tance, reared its head above the re&s;t; near
us towered the Schreckhorn, Wetterhorn, and Jungfrau|horn,
but le&s;s elevated in appearance than the point on
which we &s;tood. Below us we ob&s;erved a valley of ice about
two miles in breadth, and of &s;uch immen&s;e length, that one
extremity &s;eemed to join Mont-Blanc, and the other to be
clo&s;ed by the Titlis. To the ea&s;t, the Roth&s;tock, the Plan|gen,
and the mountains of Uri, neither &s;o wild nor &s;o ele|vated
as tho&s;e to the &s;outh; and towards the north-we&s;t, the
eye repo&s;ed it&s;elf over the le&s;s dreary and more cultivated
parts of Switzerland, as far as the borders of Al&s;ace and Sua|bia.
Immediately below us we noticed the abbey; and we
heard the &s;ound of &s;everal mortars, which the abbot ordered
to be fired as a &s;ignal that we were al&s;o &s;een: by means of a&endq;
<PB N="246" REF="270">
&s;mall tele&s;cope I ob&s;erved the fire and &s;moke; and five mi|nutes
elap&s;ed before the &s;ound reached us, not in a &s;trait di|rection,
but re-echoed between the &s;urrounding rocks. We
had propo&s;ed to kindle a fire, and to let off &s;ome hand-gre|nades,
but the cold prevented us from &s;triking fire. Not
being able to &s;upport its extremity more than three quar|ters
of an hour, although the &s;un &s;hone very bright, and we
kept our&s;elves in continual motion, we placed a black flag on
the highe&s;t point.</P>
<P>&startq;WE were as fortunate in de&s;cending as in mounting.
We came to the Under-Titlis at half pa&s;t eleven; to the
Laubergrat at one, where we again took &s;ome refre&s;hment;
and having let off our grenades, we reached the abbey at five
in the afternoon. We felt no other inconvenience from this
expedition, than that our faces were &s;welled and our &s;kins
peeled, from the reflection of the &s;un; and that for &s;ome
hours after my return to Engelberg, I lo&s;t my &s;ight and my
hearing, both which however I &s;oon recovered. Undoubt|edly
the Titlis is the highe&s;t mountain in Switzerland, ex|cepting
Mont-Blanc, to which it is not much inferior.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is to be regretted, that this expedition was only a mere
object of curio&s;ity; and that the ingenious phy&s;ician carried
with him neither thermometer nor barometer. His a&s;&s;ertion
that the Titlis is higher than any mountain in Switzerland,
will, for this rea&s;on, and without farther proofs, admit of
much doubt; and its elevation, though very con&s;iderable,
mu&s;t be greatly inferior to that of Mont-Blanc; as will ap|pear
by con&s;idering that the expedition from the plain of
<PB N="247" REF="271">
Engelberg to the top of the Titlis was performed in eight
hours; whereas Dr. Paccard and James Balma employed
fifteen in attaining the &s;ummit of Mont-Blanc; and the place
from which they took their departure, is probably much
higher above the level of the &s;ea than the valley of En|gelberg.</P>
<P><DATE>Augu&s;t 25.</DATE></P>
<P>TRAVELLERS, in going from Engelberg to Altdorf, u&s;ual|ly
return to Stantz or Buochs, embark on the lake of Lu|cerne,
and proceed the re&s;t of the way by water; but as I
had already vi&s;ited tho&s;e places, I preferred following the
route acro&s;s the mountains. The morning being ob&s;cure
and rainy, we were detained till nine o'clock, when the
weather clearing up I &s;et out, in company with Me&s;&s;rs. Bal|thazar
and Meyer, of Lucerne. Pa&s;&s;ing through the plain of
Engelberg, we admired, on our left, a fine waterfall which
precipitates it&s;elf from mount Engel, and in about a league
arrived at a cottage belonging to the abbey, where we found
two pea&s;ants employed in making chee&s;es, and where we re|galed
our&s;elves with &s;ome excellent cream. From this point
we mounted gently by the &s;ide of the Aa, leaving on our
right the high Suren alps, who&s;e pointed tops occa&s;ionally
bur&s;t forth amid the clouds and vapours; about a mile from
the cottage we quitted the abbot's hor&s;es, walked up a gra|dual
a&s;cent, pa&s;&s;ed a &s;uperb cataract of the Aa, and reached a
chapel noted in the&s;e parts for a &s;mall bell, which, according
to tradition, was the gift of a French traveller. Near this
chapel we ob&s;erved a hut, which is in the canton of Uri, and
from thence the a&s;cent was &s;teeper, but not difficult; we
<PB N="248" REF="272">
cro&s;&s;ed many drifts of &s;now, and were incommoded by a
keen wind and frequent &s;howers of &s;leet, hail, and rain.
At length, in about four hours after our departure from the
abbey, we reached a cro&s;s planted on the highe&s;t point;
from which elevation we &s;hould have enjoyed a mo&s;t &s;uperb
view, greatly admired by travellers, on one &s;ide towards Uri
and the chain of the St. Gothard, and on the other towards
Engelberg and the lake of Lucerne, if the weather had not
totally ob&s;cured the pro&s;pect. From this point the Titlis is
much extolled for its beautiful and maje&s;tic appearance.</P>
<P>FROM hence we de&s;cended the Enkeberg into a mo&s;t
barren region, amid a harve&s;t of pointed rocks, and over
numerous drifts of &s;now, and fallen fragments of &s;tone, in|termixed
with &s;mall patches of ru&s;&s;et herbage, which contri|buted
to render the &s;cene &s;till more dreary. Our de&s;cent
along a bare &s;lippery rock of &s;late, or in the beds of torrents,
or over large ma&s;&s;es of ice and &s;now, continued above an
hour and an half, when we ob&s;erved &s;everal huts lying in
a &s;mall plain. From their fir&s;t appearance we concluded that
we &s;hould pre&s;ently reach them, but the precipices were &s;o
&s;teep, the paths &s;o rugged, and the di&s;tance &s;o much greater
than we at fir&s;t imagined, that it employed us above an hour
and an half.</P>
<P>THE little valley, in which the&s;e huts are &s;ituated, is call|ed
<HI>Wald-nacht Alp,</HI> contains a &s;mall quantity of underwood,
and feeds a hundred and thirty-three cows, be&s;ide a few
&s;heep, goats, and hogs. The pea&s;ants employed in tending
the cattle and making chee&s;e, u&s;ually arrive on the 20th of
<PB N="249" REF="273">
June, and remain about a hundred days: the owner of the
hut in which we dried our clothes, makes every day, during
that period, two chee&s;es of twenty-five pounds each, from
the milk of eighteen cows. Having taken &s;ome refre&s;h|ment,
and recovered our fatigue, we continued along the
valley, through &s;ome groves of poplars and firs, and at its
furthe&s;t extremity we came to a &s;ingle cottage &s;eated on an
eminence, the fir&s;t hou&s;e on this &s;ide which is habitable in
winter. A little further we had a pro&s;pect of the town and
environs of Altdorf; the fertile vale of Schackeren, which,
though a very &s;teep a&s;cent, yet from this elevation &s;eemed a
level plain; the lake of Uri, &s;carcely vi&s;ible, which looked
like a &s;mall rivulet; and the di&s;tant mountains reaching be|yond
the St. Gothard. The de&s;cent, through rich fields and
pa&s;tures, was extremely &s;teep and tedious, as the gra&s;s was
rendered &s;lippery by the rain; and we did not arrive at Alt|dorf
till &s;even in the evening, wet and exceedingly fatigued,
but much plea&s;ed with our expedition. This pa&s;&s;age from
Engelberg to Altdorf is e&s;timated at &s;even leagues. A <HI>cha&s;|&s;eur</HI>
may perform it in four hours; a traveller accu&s;tomed to
mountains, in &s;ix; and a per&s;on unu&s;ed to &s;uch fatigue, will
require eight or ten hours.</P>

<P>SWITZERLAND, indeed, is a mo&s;t delightful country,
and merits the particular ob&s;ervation of the traveller,
as well for the diver&s;ity of the &s;everal governments, as for
the wonderful beauties of nature: but the impo&s;itions of

If we fortunately had not taken the latter precaution, we &s;hould have &s;ound no le&s;s difficulty in procuring hor&s;es in 1785, than in 1776; notwith|&s;tanding all the good offices of our landlord at the Black Lion; who, knowing that I was the author of Letters on Switzerland, was extremely andious to wipe away certain a&s;per&s;ions, which, in the beginning of this letter, &s;eem to glance at his native town. The two Mr. Cliffords, whom we met at Engelberg, and who, to our great &s;atisfaction, accompanied us in our tour as far as Geneva, were obliged to pur&s;ue their journey on foot, not being able to procure more than one hor&s;e, which was appropriated to their bag|gage.</NOTE>, are
inevitable taxes for the enjoyment of the&s;e its <HI>delights.</HI>
The&s;e little inconveniences, however, &s;hould be borne with
patience and good humour; nor will I trouble you with any
&s;plenetic complaints of tho&s;e unplea&s;ant circum&s;tances which
mu&s;t occur to all travellers.</P>
<P>ON quitting Altdorf, we pa&s;&s;ed at fir&s;t through a fertile
plain of pa&s;ture, in which the inhabitants were employed in
<PB N="251" REF="275">
mowing the &s;econd crop of hay; and in about nine miles
began a&s;cending. The road winds continually along the
&s;teep &s;ides of the mountains; and the Reu&s;s in many places
entirely fills up the bottom of the valley, which is very
narrow: that river &s;ometimes appeared &s;everal hundred
yards below us; here ru&s;hing a con&s;iderable way through a
fore&s;t of pines; there falling in ca&s;cades, and lo&s;ing it&s;elf in
the valley. We pa&s;&s;ed it &s;everal times, over bridges of a
&s;ingle arch, and beheld it tumbling under our feet in chan|nels
which it had forced through the &s;olid rock; innumera|ble
torrents roaring down the &s;ides of the mountains; which
were &s;ometimes bare, &s;ometimes finely wooded, with here
and there &s;ome fanta&s;tic trees clothing the &s;ides of the pre|cipice,
and half ob&s;curing the river from our view. The
darkne&s;s and &s;olitude of the fore&s;ts; the occa&s;ional liveline&s;s
and variety of the verdure; immen&s;e fragments of rock
blended with enormous ma&s;&s;es of ice; rocks of an a&s;toni&s;h|ing
height piled upon one another, and &s;hutting in the
vale;&mdash;&s;uch are the &s;ublime and magnificent &s;cenes with
which this romantic country abounds. Near Wa&s;en, is the
valley of Meyen; the torrent that da&s;hes through it, and
falls into the Reu&s;s, forms a &s;eries of mo&s;t &s;uperb cataracts,
which the traveller may enjoy by venturing to the edge of
the precipice, and &s;upporting him&s;elf again&s;t an impending
pine, that overlooks the gulf.</P>
<P>WE &s;et out this morning early from Wa&s;en, a &s;mall vil|lage
where we pa&s;&s;ed the night; and continued advancing
for &s;ome way on a rugged a&s;cent, through the &s;ame wild
and beautiful tract of country, which I have ju&s;t attempted
<PB N="252" REF="276">
to de&s;cribe. We could &s;carcely walk a hundred yards
without cro&s;&s;ing &s;everal torrents, that rolled with violence
from the tops of the mountains. This being one of the
great pa&s;&s;ages into Italy, we met many pack-hor&s;es laden
with merchandi&s;e: and as the road in particular parts is
very narrow, it required &s;ome dexterity in the hor&s;es to pa&s;s
one another without jo&s;tling. The&s;e roads, impending over
precipices, cannot fail of in&s;piring terror to tho&s;e travellers,
who are unaccu&s;tomed to them; and more particularly as the
mules and hor&s;es do not keep in the middle of the track,
but continue cro&s;&s;ing from the &s;ide of the mountain towards
the edge of an aby&s;s, then turn a&s;lant abruptly; thus form|ing,
if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, a con&s;tant zig-zag.</P>
<P>THUS far the valley of Schoellenen appeared to be
tolerably well peopled; and we pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal vil|lages
&s;ituated towards the bottom and le&s;s narrow part of the
valley: the &s;ides of the mountains were occa&s;ionally &s;trewed
with cottages; covered with fore&s;ts; or enriched with pa&s;|tures.
Still continuing to a&s;cend, the country beyond Wa&s;en
&s;uddenly changing, became more wild and perfectly de&s;ert:
there were no traces of any trees, except here and there a
&s;tubbed pine; the rocks were bare, craggy, and impending;
not the lea&s;t &s;ign of any habitation; and &s;carcely a blade
of gra&s;s to be &s;een. We then came to a bridge thrown
acro&s;s a deep cha&s;m over the Reu&s;s, which here forms a
con&s;iderable cataract down the &s;hagged &s;ides of the moun|tain,
and over immen&s;e fragments of rock which it has un|determined
in its cour&s;e. This bridge is called <HI>Teu&s;els-bruck,</HI>
or the Devil's bridge. As we &s;tood upon the bridge ad|miring
<PB N="253" REF="277">
the cataract, we were covered with a kind of drizz|ling
rain; the river throwing up the &s;pray to a con&s;iderable
height. The&s;e are &s;ublime &s;cenes of horror, of which tho&s;e
who have not been &s;pectators, can form no competent idea:
they defy the repre&s;entations of painting or poetry<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Many travellers have been di&s;ap|pointed on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> view of the Devil's bridge. It ought therefore to be remarked, that the bridge it&s;elf, though of difficult ex|ecution, is a trifling object, and not &s;o &s;tupendous as many others in Switzerland; and that it is the wild and maje&s;tic &s;cenery that a&s;toni&s;hes and exalts the beholder.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOT far from this de&s;olate land&s;cape, the road led us into
the <HI>Urner-loch,</HI> a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age hollowed through a
rock of granite<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age was hollowed in 1707, by Peter Moretini, a native of Val-Maggia, at the expence of the inhabitants in the valley of Urferen. It is nine feet in breadth, ten in height, and two hundred and twenty in length.</NOTE>, which opened at the oppo&s;ite entrance into
the &s;erene and cultivated valley of Ur&s;eren: the objects that
pre&s;ented them&s;elves were, a village backed by a high
mountain, on the &s;ides of which was a wood of pines; pea|&s;ants
at work in the fields; cattle feeding in the meadows;
and the Reu&s;s, which lately da&s;hed over rude fragments of
rock in a continual cataract, now flowed &s;ilently and &s;mooth|ly;
while the &s;un, which had been hidden from us in the
deep valley, here &s;hone in full &s;plendour. In general there
is a regular gradation from extreme wildne&s;s to high culti|vation;
but here the tran&s;ition was abrupt, and the change
in&s;tantaneous: it was like the lifting up a curtain, and
had all the appearance of enchantment.</P>
<P>IN this valley are four villages, Ur&s;eren, Hopital, Realp,
and Zundorf; forming a &s;mall republic under the protection
<PB N="254" REF="278">
of Uri. The territory of this little commonwealth is about
nine miles in length and two in breadth, and contains about
thirteen hundred &s;ouls. The people elect, in their general
a&s;&s;embly, their <HI>Talamman</HI> or chief, as al&s;o &s;ome other magi&s;|trates:
and there is a permanent council of fifteen members,
who a&s;&s;emble in each of the different di&s;tricts. The inhabi|tants
enjoy great privileges; but are not ab&s;olutely indepen|dent:
for in civil cau&s;es an appeal lies from their courts of
ju&s;tice to Altdorf; and in criminal proceedings, two deputies
from the government of Uri are pre&s;ent at the trial, and de|liver
to the judges of the valley the opinion of the council of
Altdorf.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the con&s;iderable elevation of this
valley, and the coldne&s;s of the air even at this &s;ea&s;on of the
year, it produces excellent pa&s;ture. The only wood therein,
is the &s;mall plantation of pines above the village of Ur&s;eren,
which is pre&s;erved with uncommon care and reverence, and
a &s;mall quantity of under-wood and &s;tubbed willows, that
feather the banks of the Reu&s;s. In the adjacent country
there are &s;everal mines of chry&s;tal; of which a con&s;idera|ble
quantity is exported. The language of the country is a
kind of provincial German, but almo&s;t every per&s;on &s;peaks
Italian.</P>
<P>THE valley of Ur&s;eren is a &s;mall plain &s;urrounded by high
mountains, covered with pa&s;ture to a con&s;iderable height,
who&s;e tops are barren rocks, in many parts capped with
&s;now. Near the middle of this beautiful plain we turned to
the left, and entered the valley of St. Gothard, filled with
<PB N="255" REF="279">
the ruins of broken mountains; the Reu&s;s, a mo&s;t rapid and
vehement torrent, bur&s;ting through it; on each &s;ide, im|men&s;e
&s;hattered blocks of granite, of a beautiful greyi&s;h co|lour
(and of which the &s;ummits of the&s;e alps are compo&s;ed)
confu&s;edly piled together.</P>
<P>THE valley of St. Gothard, though not &s;o wild as that of
Schoellenen, is yet exceedingly dreary. It does not contain a
&s;ingle &s;hed, or produce a &s;ingle tree; and the &s;ides of the
mountains are barely &s;prinkled with &s;hort herbage. The
extremity is clo&s;ed by the &s;till ruder and naked rocks of the
Feudo, &s;upporting in its hollows va&s;t ma&s;&s;es of &s;now, while
the &s;uperb glacier of the Locendro towers above the adjacent
heights. It is about two leagues from Ur&s;eren to this place;
but the road, con&s;idering the ruggedne&s;s of the rocks and
the &s;teepne&s;s of the a&s;cent, is not incommodious: it is from
nine to twelve feet broad; and is almo&s;t as well paved as the
&s;treets of London.</P>
<P>WE are now lodged at a hou&s;e inhabited by two Italian
friars from the convent of Capuchins at Milan, who receive
all &s;trangers that pa&s;s through the&s;e inho&s;pitable regions. One
of the friars is ab&s;ent, &s;o that I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bed|chamber:
it is a &s;nug little room, where any man may &s;leep
very well without being an anchorite; and which, after the
fatigues of our journey, I enjoy with a &s;atisfaction much too
&s;en&s;ible to envy the luxury of a palace. Our ho&s;t has ju&s;t
&s;upplied us with a dinner, con&s;i&s;ting of delicious trout, with
which the neighbouring lake of Locendro abounds, eggs,
<PB N="256" REF="280">
and milk, together with excellent butter and chee&s;e; both
made in this dreary &s;pot.</P>
<P>UPON our arrival we were rejoiced to find a good fire;
the weather being &s;o exceedingly cold, that I, who was only
clad in a thin camlet coat, entered the hou&s;e half frozen. It is
&s;ingular to find, at the di&s;tance of only a day's journey, &s;uch
a difference in the climate: the air is ab&s;olutely in a freezing
&s;tate; and I ju&s;t now pa&s;&s;ed a boy at work, who was blowing
his fingers to warm them. If the cold is &s;o piercing in the
mid&s;t of &s;ummer, how intolerable mu&s;t it prove in Decem|ber?
The &s;now begins to fall the latter end of September;
and the lakes about this &s;pot are frozen during eight months
in the year.</P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from vi&s;iting the &s;ources of the Te&s;ino
and the Reu&s;s; which ri&s;e within a &s;hort di&s;tance of each
other. The Te&s;ino has three principal &s;ources in the chain
of the St. Gothard. The fir&s;t is a &s;pring which ri&s;es towards
the bottom of the Pro&s;a, and is entirely covered with frozen
&s;now, or, when that is melted, with fallen fragments of rock,
through which it trickles in numerous currents, that unite
and help to form a &s;mall lake: from this piece of water it
communicates with two other lakes, and i&s;&s;ues in a more
con&s;iderable torrent. The lake of La Sella, in another part
of the ea&s;tern chain, &s;upplies the &s;econd &s;ource; and the
third is furni&s;hed by the &s;nows of Mount Feudo. The&s;e
three &s;ources uniting with another branch, that flows from
the Furca through the valley of Bedreto, form one great
torrent, which takes its cour&s;e towards the &s;outh, enters the
<PB N="259" REF="281">
lake of Locarno, and traver&s;ing part of the Milane&s;e, falls
into the Po. The &s;ource of the Reu&s;s is the lake of Locen|dro,
an oblong piece of water about three miles in circum|ference,
which is embo&s;omed between the mountains of Pe|tina
and Locendro, and is almo&s;t entirely &s;upplied by the im|men&s;e
glaciers which crown the &s;ummit of the Locendro.
The &s;tream i&s;&s;uing from this lake ru&s;hes down the valley of
St. Gothard, and joining in the vale of Ur&s;eren the two
branches which come from the Furca on one &s;ide, and from
the Gri&s;on mountains on the other, flows towards the north
into the lake of Lucerne, and from thence throws it&s;elf into
the Aar. In allu&s;ion to the oppo&s;ite cour&s;es of the Te&s;ino
and the Reu&s;s, M. de Boufflers &s;aid, that from the top of the
St. Gothard, a man might &s;pit into the ocean and the Medi|terranean.</P>
<P>WITHIN a day's journey is the &s;ource of the Rhine in the
Gri&s;ons; and about the di&s;tance of three leagues, that of the
Rhone in the Furca: which mountain we &s;hall pa&s;s to|morrow.
We are &s;till &s;urrounded by very high, rugged
rocks, and inacce&s;&s;ible glaciers; &s;o that our view is much
confined; and though I walked above a league towards Italy,
in hopes of enjoying an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over that de|lightful
country, yet I could ob&s;erve nothing but rocks, pre|cipices,
and torrents.</P>
<P>I AM at this in&s;tant near<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. de Sau&s;&s;ure, the &s;pot upon which the hou&s;e of the Capuchin $i iars is built, is 1,061 French toi&s;es above the &s;ea.</NOTE> &s;even thou&s;and feet perpendi|cular
above the level of the &s;ea: no incon&s;iderable height,
<PB N="260" REF="282">
mo&s;t certainly. Neverthele&s;s, if I gave credit to tho&s;e, who
a&s;&s;ert, that this mountain is the loftie&s;t point of Europe, I
&s;hould rai&s;e my&s;elf in idea above twice as high: but I have
rea&s;on to think, that this opinion is founded upon fal&s;e cal|culations.
Mikeli, who mea&s;ured the principal mountains
of Switzerland, but who is very inaccurate in his calcula|tions,
con&s;iders the St. Gothard as the highe&s;t; and he e&s;ti|mates
its elevation above the &s;ea as equal to 17,600 feet. But
the truth is, that, &s;o far from being of that height, it is by
no means the highe&s;t ground of Switzerland; and there is
probably not one mountain, either in Europe, A&s;ia, or Afri|ca,
of that altitude. According to General Pfiffer, the &s;um|mit
of the St. Gothard ri&s;es above the &s;ea 9,075 feet: an ele|vation
con&s;iderably le&s;s than that of Aetna and Teneriff; and
&s;till inferior to &s;everal mountains in the great chain of alps,
to which we are bending our cour&s;e.</P>

<P>ON my entrance into the little plain in which the friar's
hou&s;e is &s;ituated, although the air was exceedingly keen, I
did not experience that piercing cold which I felt in 1776:
but the day was fine, and the &s;un &s;hone unclouded. When
we arrived at the hou&s;e, the friar was &s;aying ma&s;s to an au|dience
of about twenty per&s;ons; many of whom de&s;cend
from the neighbouring alps, where they are tending cattle,
to divine &s;ervice on Sundays and fe&s;tivals. At the conclu|&s;ion
of ma&s;s, the friar, who&s;e name is Francis, immediately
recollected, and received me with great &s;atisfaction. He is
<PB N="261" REF="283">
well known to all travellers that pa&s;s this way, having al|ready
inhabited this dreary &s;pot above twenty years. Since
my la&s;t expedition, he has con&s;iderably enlarged his hou&s;e,
and rendered it extremely commodious. It contains at pre|&s;ent,
be&s;ide &s;everal &s;itting-rooms, kitchens, and one apart|ment
for the family, nine &s;mall but neat bedchambers ap|propriated
to travellers. The expence of this addition has
already amounted to &pound;. 300, part of which he collected in
various di&s;tricts of Switzerland; and an equal &s;um is re|quired
to di&s;charge the pre&s;ent debts, and to make the fur|ther
nece&s;&s;ary improvements; which &s;um he intends to pro|cure
by another collection. Friar Francis obligingly accom|panied
me about the environs, and favoured me with the fol|lowing
particulars, in addition to my former account.</P>
<P>THE chain of mountains, which immediately &s;urround
this place, takes the general appellation of St. Gothard; and
its particular parts are called by different names; of which
the principal are, the Salla, Pro&s;a, and Surecha, to the ea&s;t;
the Feudo, the Petina, and the Locendro, to the we&s;t; to the
north, the Ur&s;ino; and to the &s;outh, the ridge of naked and
piked rocks of the Val-Maggia. Of the&s;e the Feudo is the
mo&s;t elevated: its highe&s;t point ri&s;es above 2,000 feet above
the plain in which &s;tands the friar's hou&s;e, and requires three
hours to reach it. There are &s;ix pa&s;tures on the neighbour|ing
heights; on which are fed two hundred cows, a hundred
and fifty goats, and thirty hor&s;es.</P>
<P>ON examining, at mid-day, Reaumur's thermometer,
placed in the &s;hade in a northern a&s;pect, I was much &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to find, that the mercury &s;tood at 6 6/$word$ above freezing
<PB N="262" REF="284">

exceedingly keen, and, if I had judged from my own feel|ings,
I &s;hould have concluded that the air was in a freezing

<OPENER><DATELINE>Mun&s;ter in the Vallais, <DATE>Augu&s;t 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Arrived here late ye&s;terday evening; and &s;o fatigued
that I was incapable of writing: but I am this morning
quite refre&s;hed with a comfortable &s;leep, and in &s;pirits to
continue my journal. I took leave of our ho&s;t of St. Go|thard,
after having wi&s;hed him a plea&s;ant winter in that
dreary &s;ituation; and walked alone, for about two leagues,
down the valley of St. Gothard. I frequently quit my com|pany,
and either go before, or &s;tay behind, that I may enjoy
uninterrupted, and with a &s;ort of melancholy plea&s;ure, the&s;e
&s;ublime exhibitions of Nature in her mo&s;t awful and tre|mendous
forms. I entered the valley of Ur&s;eren at Hopital;
and was again &s;truck with the &s;trong contra&s;t between that
cultivated vale and the de&s;olate country I had ju&s;t quitted.
At the &s;ame time I enjoyed a magnificent view of the high
chain that enclo&s;es the vale of Ur&s;eren; and particularly no|ticed
the towering rocks, which &s;tand in the country of the
Gri&s;ons, one of them &s;upporting on its rugged top a glacier,
from which the Rhine takes its ri&s;e. We pa&s;&s;ed through
the &s;mall village of Zundorf; and &s;topped at Realp, to pro|cure
refre&s;hment, and bait our hor&s;es. From thence we
&s;oon arrived at the extremity of the valley of Ur&s;eren;
where we began a&s;cending a path &s;o narrow, &s;teep, and
rugged, that I could not forbear &s;u&s;pecting we had mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="264" REF="286">
our way, as it &s;eemed almo&s;t impracticable for hor&s;es: upon
their arrival, however, I mounted, being fatigued with my
walk from St. Gothard to Realp. It was a &s;ingle path, up a
&s;teep mountain, where a hor&s;e, with &s;ome dexterity, could
ju&s;t put one leg before the other: and this path &s;ometimes
lay upon the edge of a precipice, very craggy and &s;tony;
where, if the &s;teed had happened to &s;tumble, we mu&s;t both
inevitably have peri&s;hed. But as I knew he had no more
fancy than my&s;elf to roll down the precipice, I flung the
bridle upon his mane, and entru&s;ted my&s;elf to his direction.
Nor had I any rea&s;on to repent of my confidence: for, in
the bad and dangerous parts, he never once tripped; where
it was &s;moother and &s;afer, indeed, he knew he had a licence
to be more carele&s;s.</P>
<P>WE came at length to a torrent, which we pa&s;&s;ed by
means of a plank, after having got our hor&s;es over with
&s;ome difficulty: a little way farther we arrived at another,
deeper and more violent than the former, over which there
was no bridge; nor the lea&s;t appearance of any track on the
other &s;ide; a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any habitation; and
our guide unacquainted with the road. After &s;ome ob&s;erva|tion
we di&s;covered, that the mountain had lately fallen down,
and overwhelmed the path; leaving only a very faint narrow
track on the &s;ide of the precipice: along which my compa|nions
&s;crambled upon their hands and knees. While I was
cro&s;&s;ing the torrent on hor&s;eback, I heard a &s;cream; and
turning round, &s;aw one of our &s;ervants &s;eized with a panic
on the very edge of the precipice, and vehemently exclaim|ing,
that he could neither get backwards or forwards. Ne|verthele&s;s,
<PB N="265" REF="287">
with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he pa&s;&s;ed over; declaring,
at the &s;ame time, that he would take care never to put him|&s;elf
again in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. We now regained a kind of
path, but &s;o extremely &s;teep, that we prudently di&s;mounted,
and &s;uffered the hor&s;es to make their own way. With much
difficulty, and after having cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal large drifts of ice
and &s;now, the torrents at the &s;ame time rumbling under our
feet; we reached, by a very &s;teep a&s;cent, the &s;ummit of the
Furca. A number of rugged and forked rocks, piled one
above another, have occa&s;ioned, it is &s;aid, this chain to be
called the <HI>Furca.</HI> The country immediately around was as
dreary and de&s;olate as the valley of Schoellenen; all vegeta|tion
&s;eemed to have cea&s;ed: lower down, the mountains
were covered with h$rbage and &s;weet-&s;cented flowers; near
us, but higher, on the left, between the Blaueberg and the
Lungnetz, lay a large body of ice, from which i&s;&s;ued a tor|rent
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I was informed by a friar of Realp, who is much u&s;ed to travel in the&s;e parts, that this torrent, which is turbid in &s;um|mer, is, in winter, as tran&s;parent as the cleare&s;t &s;pring; and that when the accumu|lation of the &s;now prevents it from $lowing under the glacier of the Furea, it then forms a lake, runs over the ice, and ru&s;hes to the Vallais with the waters it receives in its cour&s;e.</NOTE>, probably one of the fir&s;t &s;ources of the Rhone. In a
word, the &s;everal maje&s;tic objects that pre&s;ented them&s;elves
to our view, formed a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene.</P>
<P>FROM hence we de&s;cended broken rocks and craggy pre|cipices
for a con&s;iderable way. By this time I was &s;o con&s;i|derably
fatigued, that I was glad to &s;it down, and take &s;ome
refre&s;hment, con&s;i&s;ting of bread, chee&s;e, and hard eggs; the
only provi&s;ion we could procure at Realp. We were &s;eated
by a &s;tream of clear water ripling down the &s;ide of a moun|tain,
<PB N="266" REF="288">
&s;o exceedingly &s;teep, that our humble repa&s;t would
have rolled away, if it had not been well &s;upported. In full
view before us was the glacier of the Furca; an immen&s;e
valley of ice, extending at lea&s;t three miles in length, and
near a mile in breadth between the Gletcherberg and the
Satzberg, rocks more &s;hagged, if po&s;&s;ible, than any of the
neighbouring mountains: it &s;tretches from their feet, fills
up the intervening cha&s;m, and reaches almo&s;t to their &s;um|mits.
The &s;un &s;hining in an oppo&s;ite direction, it gli&s;tened
like chry&s;tal; while the blue tints, reflected on the &s;urface,
appeared inexpre&s;&s;ibly beautiful. The ice &s;eemed to break
in &s;everal parts, as we heard &s;ome loud and deep cracks; the
torrent of the Rhone at the &s;ame time roaring beneath.
That river is chiefly formed by this glacier: the &s;mall tor|rent,
which bur&s;ts from the body of ice between the Blaue|berg
and the Lungnetz, being joined by &s;everal &s;treams,
lo&s;es it&s;elf under the va&s;t arch of ice that forms the bottom
of the glacier; i&s;&s;ues con&s;iderably augmented; and is the
great and principal &s;ource from whence the Rhone takes its
ri&s;e. The range of mountains on which we were &s;itting,
was over&s;pread with underwood and herbage; and &s;ome
cattle were feeding along the heights: a fine contra&s;t to the
&s;terility of the oppo&s;ite chain; which appeared, for &s;ome ex|tent,
nothing but bare rock, except where it was covered
with ice and frozen &s;now.</P>
<P>AFTER we had fini&s;hed our banquet, and repo&s;ed our|&s;elves
for a &s;hort time, contemplating the &s;ingularity of the
&s;cene; we de&s;cended to the bottom of the glacier, where we
admired the Rhone breaking forth with violence from the
<PB N="267" REF="289">
bed of ice, near the huge fragments of a fallen rock. We
followed the cour&s;e of that river, and proceeded down a
mountain &s;o &s;teep, that &s;everal parts of the road winding
along its &s;ides, were frequently parallel to each other. The
&s;cenery of the valley, which we now entered, was of the
&s;ame nature as that of Schoellenen; the Rhone foaming
with amazing rapidity, and falling in a continual cataract at
the foot of irregular and immea&s;urable alps. We travelled
through this valley above two leagues, perpetually a&s;cending
or de&s;cending the rugged &s;ides of rocks; one monent clo&s;e
to the river, and the next &s;ome hundred yards above it. At
fir&s;t the rocks were either bare, or &s;tudded with a few &s;trag|gling
pines; but as we advanced, they became more clothed
with wood and verdure: &s;till, however, we ob&s;erved no
traces of any habitation; and we had now mea&s;ured at lea&s;t
fifteen miles, from our fir&s;t quitting the valley of Ur&s;eren,
without having &s;een a &s;ingle dwelling. I was here &s;o &s;truck
with the beauty of the fore&s;ts through which we pa&s;&s;ed, and
the luxuriance of the pa&s;ture, that I could not avoid expre&s;|&s;ing
my a&s;toni&s;hment on ob&s;erving no appearance of any
habitation in the&s;e delightful &s;pots. I had &s;carcely made the
remark, when four or five cottages, &s;ituated on the other
&s;ide of the Rhone, upon a beautiful declivity, announced our
approach to the Vallais. Not long afterwards, we unexpect|edly
came to an opening which commanded an exten&s;ive
view of that fertile vale, containing &s;everal &s;cattered vil|lages.
In this very &s;pot a pea&s;ant of ta&s;te, has built his
cottage. Here we quitted the bad road; and de&s;cended into
the Vallais.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="290">
WE had propo&s;ed pa&s;&s;ing the night at Oberwald, after
the fatigues of the day: but, upon inquiry, we found it
could &s;upply us with no refre&s;hment. The ma&s;ter of a little
hovel, which was called an inn, pointed to a large chee&s;e,
and told us that was all his provi&s;ion; it was his bread, his
fi&s;h, and his meat. Meeting with no better reception at
Oberge&s;tlen, we continued on to Mun&s;ter, where we did not
arrive till late: here we found an excellent inn for this
country, which afforded good bread, and even &s;ome meat;
but what was far more comfortable to me, a quiet room and
a clean bed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Spital upon the Grim&s;el, <DATE>Augu&s;t 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Vallai&s;ans are remarkably attached to their li|berty.
Upon our quitting Mun&s;ter, this morning,
we joined company with a pea&s;ant, with whom we had a
long conver&s;ation. He demanded our opinion of the coun|try;
and, pointing to the mountains, exclaimed: &startq;Behold
our walls and bulwarks; Con&s;tantinople is not &s;o &s;trong|ly
fortified.&endq; This upper part of the Vallais, I &s;hould
imagine, is not much frequented by travellers, if we may
judge from the curio&s;ity of the people, who all came out to
gaze upon us; and when they di&s;covered that we were Eng|li&s;hmen,
they ob&s;erved us with greater attention. But
what particularly &s;urpri&s;ed us was, that the pea&s;ant above|mentioned
inquired concerning the &s;tate of our war with the
Americans. It &s;eemed indeed &s;omewhat extraordinary, that
a common pea&s;ant of the Vallais, &s;hould know there was
&s;uch a place as Con&s;tantinople; but it was not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;|ing,
that he &s;hould ever have heard of the conte&s;t between
Great Britain and her American colonies.</P>
<P>AFTER returning about a league through the &s;ame fertile
and well-cultivated country which we traver&s;ed ye&s;terday,
we left the plain, and a&s;cended the Grim&s;el: one of tho&s;e
<PB N="270" REF="292">
alps which &s;eparate the Vallais from the canton of Berne.
We employed four hours in climbing a &s;teep and craggy
road to the &s;ummit; and &s;hould have con&s;idered the attempt
as &s;carcely practicable, had we not been encouraged by the
experience of ye&s;terday. We cro&s;&s;ed the &s;everal &s;hades of
vegetation: in the valley, and the lower parts of the moun|tain,
corn and rich meadows; then fore&s;ts of larch and pine;
next, &s;hort gra&s;s, together with &s;everal &s;pecies of herbs, that
afford exqui&s;ite pa&s;ture to the cattle; to the&s;e &s;ucceeded the
various tribes of mo&s;&s;es and lichens; and then bare rock and
&s;now. It would be curious to con&s;truct, or at lea&s;t to ima|gine,
a &s;cale of vegetation, according to the idea of a French
writer; who a&s;&s;erts, that exce&s;&s;ive cold and exce&s;&s;ive heat
are equally pernicious. The tops of the&s;e high mountains
are barren, and produce no plants; and at certain heights
nothing but mo&s;&s;es and lichens will vegetate: the &s;ame oc|curs
in climates where the heat is intolerable; as no other
vegetable productions are ob&s;erved in the burning &s;ands of
Africa. The lichens and mo&s;&s;es then, which &s;upport the
cold better than other plants, would form the fir&s;t degree of
a &s;cale adju&s;ted to determine, how far vegetation accords
with the temperature of the atmo&s;phere. The &s;ame families
of plants, as they bear al&s;o the heat much better than any
other, would occupy the la&s;t degree in the &s;cale above-men|tioned.
Thus, according to this fanciful &s;cale, the two ex|tremes
touch each other &s;urpri&s;ingly.</P>
<P>FROM the top of the Grim&s;el we de&s;cended about two
miles, and arrived at a &s;mall plain or hollow in the mid&s;t of
the mountains; containing one &s;olitary hovel: and from
<PB N="271" REF="293">
this hovel I am now writing to you. Notwith&s;tanding the
wretched appearance it made at fir&s;t &s;ight, we found in this
de&s;ert &s;pot all the accommodations we could wi&s;h for, ex|cept
beds; and the&s;e are the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, after our &s;ound
&s;leep la&s;t night. Not to mention excellent chee&s;e, butter,
and milk (our ordinary fare) we obtain &s;ome good wine, a
&s;mall portion of kid, and a boiled <HI>marmot</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See an account of the Marmot in Vol. iii.</NOTE>, which we have
ju&s;t devoured; although at another time we &s;hould have
revolted at the very idea. The landlord is &s;tationed in this
forlorn region by the canton of Berne, and he re&s;ides in it
about nine months. He u&s;ually arrives here on the fir&s;t of
March, and retires in the beginning of December. His
bu&s;ine&s;s is to receive all travellers; upon condition, however,
that they pay for their accommodations. When he quits the
place, he leaves a certain quantity of chee&s;e, hard bread,
&s;alted provi&s;ion, and fuel, in ca&s;e any unfortunate wanderer
&s;hould happen to come this way, when the winter has &s;et
in; and we ob&s;erved long poles fixed on both &s;ides of the
track, at &s;mall di&s;tances from each other, in order to point
out the path to travellers, who may chance to pa&s;s this
mountain after the &s;now has begun to fall. The road is
&s;eldom open for hor&s;es before the fir&s;t of June. Near the
hou&s;e, upon the top of a &s;mall rock, our ho&s;t has contrived a
kind of little garden, by bringing &s;ome earth from the
neighbouring pa&s;tures: and this &s;mall piece of ground &s;up|plies
him tolerably well with turnips and cabbages; al|though,
on account of the height of the circumjacent moun|tains,
it does not long enjoy the warmth of the &s;un.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="294">
NUMEROUS herds of goats are kept, during the &s;ummer
months, upon the&s;e mountains: they are let out every
morning to feed upon the pa&s;tures; and return every even|ing
before &s;un-&s;et to be milked and hou&s;ed. It was a plea&s;|ing
&s;ight to ob&s;erve them marching homeward in the &s;ame
herd; and following each other down the broken precipices,
and along the rugged &s;ides of the rocks.</P>
<P>THIS hovel, be&s;ide the &s;torehou&s;es for chee&s;es, contains
only a &s;mall kitchen, a bed-chamber appropriated to the fa|mily,
and a room, in which we are now &s;itting. We occupy
nearly one &s;ide; the other is taken up by our &s;ervants, the
landlord and his wife, and half a dozen hone&s;t labourers:
the latter are partaking of their homely &s;upper, with all the
reli&s;h of well-earned hunger; and are enjoying a &s;hort re|&s;pite
from their toil, with that noi&s;y mirth which character|i&s;es
this cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>THE &s;ources of the Aar are in the&s;e mountains. Near
our hovel are three lakes that &s;upply waters to that river,
which rolls down in an impetuous torrent from the neigh|bouring
glaciers. While dinner was preparing, I walked by
the &s;ide of that river &s;earching for cry&s;tals; which are very
common in the&s;e parts: we found pieces of divers colours,
white, black, yellow, and green. The&s;e mountains certainly
abound al&s;o in rich veins of gold, and other metals; a con&s;i|derable
quantity of gold-du&s;t being found in the bed of the
Aar<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It has been &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that no gold-du&s;t is found in the Aar, until it has re|ceived the Reichen-bach.</NOTE>, and in the various torrents. I can conceive nothing
<PB N="273" REF="295">
more fatal to the intere&s;ts of Switzerland, nor more repug|nant
to the liberties of the people, than to have the&s;e mines
of gold or &s;ilver traced and opened. A &s;udden overflow of
riches would effectually change and corrupt their manners:
and it is an inconte&s;table truth, that the real power of a
country, not ambitious of making conque&s;ts, is derived le&s;s
from the wealth than from the indu&s;try of its &s;ubjects; the
happine&s;s of a people, as well as of an individual, con&s;i&s;ting
in being contented. What a chaos of mountains are here
heaped upon one another! a dreary, de&s;olate, but &s;ublime
appearance: it looks like the ruins and wreck of a world.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>On the Grim&s;el, <DATE>Augu&s;t 29, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will recollect that, in 1776<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the preceding Letter.</NOTE>, I de&s;cribed the pa&s;&s;age
of the Furca as extremely difficult, and attended with &s;ome
danger. But that was my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay over the le&s;s frequented
alps. How different are our &s;en&s;ations at different intervals!
To-day, on mea&s;uring the &s;ame ground, though I did not
find the road as <HI>&s;mooth as a bowling-green,</HI> I yet never once
di&s;mounted; but rode with my Letters on Switzerland in my
hand, occa&s;ionally making notes and ob&s;ervations: it mu&s;t,
however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that in many parts, where a faint
path along the crags and impending precipices were &s;carcely
obvious, my &s;ituation was not very favourable for accurate
compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>FROM the top of the Furea, in&s;tead of immediately de|&s;cending
and pur&s;uing the &s;ame road which I followed in
1776, we &s;ent our hor&s;es forwards, and a&s;cended the Galle|berg
<PB N="274" REF="296">
to the upper part of the glacier of the Furca: from
thence we looked down upon the Vallais and the Rhone
flowing through it, as upon a &s;mall field watered by a rill;
above and around, as far as the eye could reach, we ob&s;erved
numberle&s;s pointed alps, and particularly that &s;tupendous
chain called the <HI>Aar-Gletchers,</HI> which compri&s;es, among
many others, the Fin&s;ter-aar-horn, the Wetter-horn, the
Jung-frau-horn, and the Schreck-horn.</P>
<P>THE upper part of this glacier of the Furca, is far more
beautiful than the lower extremity; the &s;now is of a more
virgin white; the pyramids of ice more bold; and the blue
tints more lively and animated. Having enjoyed in different
directions this icy &s;cene, we de&s;cended near the edge of the
glacier, and refre&s;hed our&s;elves with &s;ome water from two
tran&s;parent &s;prings called <HI>Augh&s;tweicht-brunnen,</HI> that bur&s;t
from the &s;ides of the rock, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each
other. We then went down a very &s;teep de&s;cent, till we
joined the track which I pur&s;ued in 1776. I recollected,
with a plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction, the torrent, near which we ate
on that occa&s;ion our humble repa&s;t; and came to the Rhone
about half a mile below the &s;pot where it bur&s;ts in two
&s;treams from the bottom of the glacier. In order to have
a nearer view, we cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treams, which, though
&s;carcely three feet in depth, ru&s;hed with &s;uch violence, as
almo&s;t to overturn the guide, who conveyed me acro&s;s on
his &s;houlders. Having admired the arch of ice, and paid
our ob$i&s;ance to the maje&s;tic habitation of the River-God,
we walked at the foot of the Satzberg, and noticed &s;everal
lively &s;prings i&s;&s;uing from the ground, which the inhabitants
call <HI>cold waters;</HI> and a little further three warm &s;ources, in
<PB N="275" REF="297">
which the mercury in Reaumur's thermometer &s;tood at ten
degrees above freezing point, or 55 of Fahrenheit. The&s;e
&s;ources, uniting with &s;everal cold &s;prings, fall, within a few
paces from their ri&s;e, into the great torrent that flows from
the glacier, and are u&s;ually con&s;idered as the <HI>true</HI> &s;ources
of the Rhone. That honour is appropriated to the&s;e little
rills, becau&s;e, being of an equal temperature in all &s;ea&s;ons of
the year, they do not owe their origin, like the <HI>cold waters,</HI>
to the melted &s;now and ice, and are as abundant in winter as
in &s;ummer. It appears, however, extremely incon&s;i&s;tent, to
dignify the&s;e little &s;treams with the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> title of the
&s;ources of the Rhone; for that river undoubtedly owes its
origin and greatne&s;s to the perpetual and inexhau&s;tible &s;up|plies
from the &s;urrounding glaciers.</P>
<P>WE had now employed above nine hours from the time
of our quitting the valley of Ur&s;eren; and &s;hould have con|tinued
much longer amid the&s;e maje&s;tic &s;cenes, if the de|clining
&s;un had not reminded us of approaching night.
Being &s;till at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any habitation, we
continued our route, and began a&s;cending the Grim&s;el, near
the warm &s;ources of the Rhone. The track, though ex|tremely
&s;teep, and as perpendicular as a man could well
mount, was not dangerous, becau&s;e the rocks were thickly
covered with &s;mall &s;hrubs, herbage, and mo&s;&s;es. After
an hour and a quarter's t$dious a&s;cent, we reached the &s;um|mit
of the Grim&s;el, and de&s;cending a rugged ridge of gra|nite
rocks, we looked down upon a lake, from which i&s;&s;ues
a &s;tream that falls into the Rhone. A little further we
pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;mall rills and dark lakes which &s;upply the
Aar; in le&s;s than an hour we entered the road which leads
<PB N="276" REF="298">
to the Vallais, and came to the place of our de&s;tination, the
&s;ame hovel on the Grim&s;el, where I pa&s;&s;ed the night on my
former expedition. We arrived there about eight in the
evening, after a journey which employed us more than
twelve hours.</P>
<P>No &s;ituation can exceed the &s;olitary horror of the &s;cenery
on the top of the Grim&s;el. Its appearance re&s;embled the in|&s;ide
of a mine, and &s;eemed as if the bowels of the earth had
been violently rent a&s;under; reminding me of that &s;ublime
de&s;cription in the Aeneis, when the in&s;ide of Cacus's cave is
in&s;tantaneou&s;ly laid open by the arm of Hercules.</P>

<P>ON entering the hovel I immediately recognized the &s;ame
landlord, who was &s;tationed here in 1776, to whom, at that
<PB N="277" REF="299">
time, I never expected to have owed a &s;econd reception in &s;o
forlorn a &s;pot. While &s;upper was preparing, a pea&s;ant and
our guide, forgetful of his great fatigue, &s;uddenly &s;tarted up
at the &s;ound of their favourite air, the <HI>Renz des vaches,</HI> play|ed
upon a rebec by a &s;hepherd, and danced &s;everal <HI>alle|mandes,</HI>
perfectly in time, and not without grace; a pictu|re&s;que
group of &s;pectators looking on and applauding.</P>
<P><DATE>Augu&s;t 30.</DATE></P>
<P>THIS morning we made a &s;hort excur&s;ion to the &s;ource of
the Aar, which takes its ri&s;e in the neighbouring glaciers.
In le&s;s than half an hour we entered a &s;mall plain, &s;kirted by
high mountains, and entirely clo&s;ed by a rugged chain of
alps, over which tower the Fin&s;ter-Aar and Lauter-Aar|horns,
and at who&s;e feet &s;tretches a glacier &s;o entirely covered
with earth and &s;tones, as to bear, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, the ap|pearance
of a &s;and-hill. From this glacier i&s;&s;ues a &startq;<HI>torrent
roaring loud</HI>&endq; of troubled waters, which is the &s;ource of
the Lower Aar, and joins, in a few hundred paces, another
&s;tream called the Upper Aar, that falls from the Zinkeberg:
the union of the&s;e two torrents forms the Aar, which ru&s;hes
over a &s;tony bed with great impetuo&s;ity. At pre&s;ent it runs
in a narrow channel; but at the fir&s;t melting of the &s;now in
&s;pring, it overflows the whole &s;pace between the mountains,
and becomes a temporary lake.</P>
<P>OUR guide is a <HI>cha&s;&s;eur,</HI> who frequently ranges over this
va&s;t chain of alps, in pur&s;uit of the chamois, an animal re|markable
for its activity in &s;couring along the craggy rocks,
and in leaping over the precipices. He informed me, that
<PB N="278" REF="300">
this glacier is the extremity of a valley of ice about twelve
miles in length, and from one to four in breadth: it then
divides into two branches; one extends towards the Schreck|horn,
and the other towards the Vallais. He expatiated with
great enthu&s;ia&s;m on the profe&s;&s;ion of a cha&s;&s;eur, though ex|tremely
laborious, and at times dangerous. He u&s;ually kills
from &s;ix to fifteen chamois in a year: with the fle&s;h, which
is very delicate, he helps to &s;upport his family, and di&s;po&s;es
of each &s;kin for a guinea. He u&s;es a rifle-barrelled gun, and
generally &s;hoots them at the di&s;tance of three or four hun|dred
yards.</P>
<P>THE chamois are very timorous, and con&s;equently watch|ful
animals. They u&s;ually go out in herds of twenty or
thirty; and while they are feeding, one of them po&s;ted on
an adjacent height &s;tands <HI>centinel,</HI> and is relieved at &s;hort
intervals by another. The <HI>centinel</HI> looks around with
great &s;olicitude and attention; and on the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of
danger, alarms the herd by a &s;hrill cry; in&s;tantly the whole
troop decamp, one following the other. The chamois feed
on various kinds of herbage, and particularly on the <HI>Lichen
Rangi&s;erinus,</HI> or rein-deer lichen, which is found in &s;uch
great quantities, as in many parts to cover the &s;ummits and
&s;ides of the mountains. In order to procure their favourite
food in winter, they, like the rein-deer, clear away the
&s;now with their fore-feet, frequently thawing it with their
breath, for the purpo&s;e of loo&s;ening it more ea&s;ily. But
when, either from the depth or hardne&s;s of the &s;now, they
cannot penetrate to the lichens, they brow&s;e on the &s;aplings
of pine and &s;ir. In &s;ummer their bodies are of a yellowi&s;h
<PB N="279" REF="301">
brown, and whiti&s;h under the throat; the hair is &s;hort and
&s;mooth: in winter their coat lengthens and grows dark, &s;o
as to re&s;emble that of a bear, and entirely to disfigure them.
Sometimes, but very rarely, they have been found &s;peckled,
or of variegated colours; and lately, a chamois, entirely
white, was &s;hot upon the Engelberg. It was in all other re|&s;pects
&s;imilar to a common chamois; and it is uncertain,
whether it owed its colour to age or accident.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS has cla&s;&s;ed the chamois in the goat genus,
under the name of <HI>rupicapra,</HI> or mountain-goat; his ac|quaintance
with the antelopes having been too &s;lender to en|able
him to form a genus of antelopes, which Pallas fir&s;t
con&s;tructed, and where he has judiciou&s;ly placed this animal.
The example of Pallas has been followed by Pennant and
&s;ucceeding zoologi&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY OF THE AAR&mdash;LAND OF HASLI&mdash;
MEYRINGEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Augu&s;t, 1786.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I FOUND the cold upon the Grim&s;el more piercing than
upon the St. Gothard; and la&s;t night it even deprived
me of my &s;leep. But then circum&s;tances were very diffe|rent
in the two lodgings: for on the St. Gothard I had a
comfortable bed; whereas, la&s;t night, I lay in the hay-loft,
without any covering: I declare, my blood has &s;carcely re|covered
its circulation. Take notice this is the twelfth of
Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>HAVING quitted our wretched abode on the Grim&s;el, we
pa&s;&s;ed along the valley of the Aar, through an uninterrupted
chain of wild, rugged, and uninhabitable alps. The road
along this valley, though much narrower than that from
Altdorf to the St. Gothard, is formed in the &s;ame manner
along the &s;teep acclivities and declivities, &s;ometimes laid
on arches, and &s;ometimes carried over bridges thrown
acro&s;s the tremendous precipices. It is paved with flat
pieces of granite, &s;o &s;mooth and &s;lippery, that the hor&s;es
would have perpetually &s;tumbled, if they had not been
rough-&s;hod. In &s;ome parts this road ran along the bare
and rugged ridges; in others, down &s;teps, either cut in the
rock, or formed by large &s;tones, &s;o that for &s;everal paces
it re&s;embled a &s;tair-ca&s;e. The whole &s;urface of the valley
<PB N="281" REF="303">
was thickly &s;trewed with va&s;t fragments of rock; while
tho&s;e, which &s;till hung on the &s;ides of the mountains, &s;eemed
threatening to overwhelm us; the river, during the whole
way, thundering along in a continual fall. This valley exhi|bits
the &s;ame kind of &s;cenes to which we have been long ac|cu&s;tomed;
except that the Aar ru&s;hes with more impetuous
rage even than the Rhone or the Reu&s;s, and is frequently &s;o
&s;welled with the torrents it receives in its cour&s;e, as to ravage
all the adjacent country: we &s;aw many marks of the&s;e terri|ble
deva&s;tations. We cro&s;&s;ed it in &s;everal places, over &s;tone
bridges of a &s;ingle arch, one of which equalled, in the length
of its &s;pan and drearine&s;s of the land&s;cape, the Devil's Bridge
in the valley of Schoellenen. About three leagues from
Spital, we had a glimp&s;e, through the trees, of the Aar falling
from a con&s;iderable height. In order to gain a nearer view,
we climbed along the &s;ides of a &s;teep rock, well covered with
mo&s;s: I leaned again&s;t a tree that impended over the preci|pice,
and &s;aw the river ru&s;hing from the rock, and &s;preading
into a &s;emicircular expan&s;ion in its de&s;cent. It fell with fury
into a deep and narrow gulf, and then lo&s;t it&s;elf in the mid&s;t
of the fore&s;t. The body of water was very con&s;iderable,
and its perpendicular fall, as far as I could judge by the eye,
at lea&s;t one hundred and fifty feet. The &s;cenery al&s;o was
&s;olemnly maje&s;tic; the grey rocks on each &s;ide ri&s;ing per|pendicularly,
and totally bare, except their tops, which were
fringed with pines. This picture&s;que &s;cene appeared to re|alize
a favourite image of cla&s;&s;ic antiquity: as I viewed the
Aar pouring its flood of waters from a crevice of the rock, I
&s;igured to my&s;elf the Nile or the Tiber bur&s;ting at once from
the urn of a River-God.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="304">
IN our way to Meyringen, we traver&s;ed large fore&s;ts of
beech and pines, the Aar roaring along the valley, and the
road, which was as craggy and rugged as u&s;ual, ince&s;&s;antly
a&s;cending and de&s;cending. We now pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal
&s;mall villages, which afforded a plea&s;ing &s;ight, after the de|&s;olate
country we had &s;o lately quitted; and entered a beau|tiful
little valley of a mo&s;t lively verdure, and delightfully
planted. All was calmne&s;s and repo&s;e: neither rapid river
nor roaring torrent to interrupt the unu&s;ual &s;tillne&s;s and
tranquillity of the &s;cene. This &s;hort interval of &s;ilence, ren|dered
us more &s;en&s;ibly affected with the turbulence of the
Aar and the loud clamour of the cataracts.</P>
<P>FROM this &s;ilent and &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, we de&s;cended to
a larger valley on the banks of the Aar. Perhaps no other
part of Switzerland would yield more delight and occupation
to the land&s;cape-painter than this picture&s;que valley, from
the agreeable and ever-changing colour of the rocks which
bound it, their &s;ummits finely broken into irregular and
fanta&s;tic forms, and from the variety and &s;ize of the frag|ments
di&s;per&s;ed near the banks of the river. Each frag|ment,
each cottage, each &s;hed, each &s;hrub, is a picture;
and the effect is con&s;iderably heightened by the tran&s;parency
of the air, and the grandeur of the back-ground.</P>
<P>WE have now vi&s;ited the &s;ources of three great rivers in
Switzerland, and traced their impetuous progre&s;s through a
tract of country, in which nature has exhibited the grande&s;t
and mo&s;t augu&s;t of her works. But how impo&s;&s;ible have I
found it to lay before you adequate de&s;criptions of the&s;e ma|je&s;tic,
<PB N="283" REF="305">
variegated, and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenes! They mu&s;t all of
them upon de&s;cription nece&s;&s;arily appear much the &s;ame: yet,
in fact, every river and cataract, every rock, mountain, and
precipice, are re&s;pectively di&s;tingui&s;hed by an infinite diver|&s;ity
of modifications, and by all the po&s;&s;ible forms of beauty,
or magnificence; of &s;ublimity, or horror. But the&s;e di&s;cri|minating
variations, though too vi&s;ibly marked to e&s;cape
even the lea&s;t ob&s;erving eye, elude repre&s;entation, and defy
the &s;tronge&s;t powers both of the pen and pencil. In a word,
you mu&s;t not judge of this romantic country, from the faint
&s;ketches I have attempted to delineate: for they can no
more convey an idea of the&s;e wonderful &s;cenes, than if I
were to aim at giving &s;ome notion of the pictures of Claude
or Salvator by informing you, that they are compo&s;ed of
paint and canva&s;s.</P>
<P>MEYRINGEN, a large and neat village, is the capital burgh
of Ha&s;liland, a di&s;trict in the canton of Berne, which enjoys
con&s;iderable privileges. The people are governed by their
own magi&s;trates, and only take oaths of fidelity to the Sove|reign
Council of Berne. All the authority, which the bailifs
in the other parts of this canton enjoy, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a great
mea&s;ure by the Landamman; who re&s;ides at Meyringen.
He is always a native of Ha&s;liland, and is appointed by the
Sovereign Council of Berne, at the recommendation of the
bailif of Interlaken. Mo&s;t of the other magi&s;trates are elect|ed
by the people, who a&s;&s;emble as occa&s;ion requires, and are
convoked by the Landamman.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants are a &s;ine race of people: the men in
general remarkably &s;trong and well made; the women tall
<PB N="284" REF="306">
and hand&s;ome. The women have an elegant manner of wear|ing
their hair, which is commonly of a beautiful brown: it
is parted from the top of the forehead, from thence brought
round and joined to the locks behind, which either hang
down their back in long tre&s;&s;es, are braided with ribband, or
woven round the head in a &s;imple plait. But the other
part of the dre&s;s does not in the lea&s;t corre&s;pond with this
elegance; as their &s;hapes, naturally fine, are &s;poiled by an
ab&s;urd fa&s;hion of wearing their petticoats &s;o high, that they
all appear as if they were far advanced in pregnancy.</P>
<P>MEYRINGEN is &s;ituated near the Aar, in a very romantic
vale; &s;urrounded by meadows of a mo&s;t luxuriant verdure,
and &s;prinkled with cottages, which are occa&s;ionally &s;eparated
from each other by huge intervening &s;tones and deep chan|nels,
the remaining effects of &s;torms and inundations.
Clo&s;e to the village, the Alp-bach, a torrent &s;o called, falls
from mount Hou&s;li, in two perpendicular ca&s;cades, but
with &s;o much violence, and in &s;o large a body of water, as
to cau&s;e frequent inundations: indeed the burgh it&s;elf has
been in danger of being overwhelmed and de&s;troyed by
its repeated ravages; again&s;t which, however, it is now pro|tected,
by a wall of con&s;iderable height and &s;olidity. Near
this torrent another fall of water, called the Dorf-bach,
glides gently down the bare rock; and further on, the
Mille-bach gli&s;tened as it de&s;cended through a hanging grove
of pines, that feather the &s;ides of the mountain.</P>
<P>As I &s;tood on a platform of rock, about fifty feet above
the bottom of the Alp-bach, I looked over the delightful vale
of Ha&s;li, ob&s;erved Mount Sheidec ri&s;ing from the banks of
<PB N="285" REF="307">
the Aar, and bending it&s;elf in one part, as if on purpo&s;e to
di&s;cover three tremendous peaks, ri&s;ing in regular gradation
one above the other; the one a naked conical rock; the
&s;econd tapering and &s;prinkled with &s;now; and the third,
which is the highe&s;t point of the Wetterhorn, of a pyra|midal
form, mantled with gli&s;tening ice.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>By this &s;tatement you will perceive, that, in proportion,
bread is much dearer than the other articles; and the rea&s;on
is obvious: for the&s;e mountainous parts con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t en|tirely
of pa&s;turages, and produce little corn. The pea&s;ants,
inhabiting the mountainous di&s;tricts of Switzerland, live
chiefly upon milk and potatoes, which are here much cul|tivated.
According to the price of provi&s;ions in England,
tho&s;e articles will appear exceedingly rea&s;onable: but then it
<PB N="286" REF="308">
ought at the &s;ame time to be con&s;idered, that money is
very &s;carce in the&s;e parts. Nor indeed is it &s;o much nece&s;|&s;ary
in a country, where there is no luxury; where all the
pea&s;antry are tolerably well provided with every nece&s;&s;ary
of life from their own little domains. I had, to-day, a long
conver&s;ation with one of the lads who accompanied us from
Altdorf, and who takes care of our hor&s;es. He lives upon
the mountains of Uri; and, as the winter la&s;ts near eight
months, during &s;ome part of which time there can be little
communication between the &s;everal cottages, every family
lays in &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for the whole winter. His own
family con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even per&s;ons, and is provided with the
following &s;tores: &s;even chee&s;es, each weighing twenty-five
pounds; a hundred and eight pounds of hard bread, twenty-five
ba&s;kets of potatoes, each weighing about forty-pounds;
&s;even goats, and three cows, one of which is killed. The
cows and hor&s;es are fed with hay, and the goats with the
boughs of firs; which, in a &s;carcity of fodder, are given al&s;o
to the other cattle. During that dreary &s;ea&s;on, the family
are employed in making linen and cloth: and, for this pur|po&s;e,
a &s;mall part of the ground belonging to each cottage,
is generally &s;own with flax. That plant has lately been
much cultivated, and with increa&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, in the moun|tainous
di&s;tricts of Switzerland.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of Appenzel and Glarus, are ge|nerally
of wood; and it was a natural ob&s;ervation of one
of our &s;ervants, in pa&s;&s;ing through a continued chain of
rocks, that, as there was no deficiency of &s;tone, it &s;eemed
extraordinary, wood alone &s;hould be employed for the pur|po&s;es
<PB N="287" REF="309">
of building. But it may be remarked, that the&s;e
wooden hou&s;es are &s;ooner con&s;tructed and ea&s;ily repaired;
and being formed in a compact manner, with &s;mall rooms,
and low ceilings, are &s;ufficiently warm even for &s;o cold a
climate. The chief objection to them ari&s;es from the danger
of fire; which, however, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure obviated by
the method of building their cottages detached from each
other. But this ob&s;ervation does not hold with re&s;pect to
&s;ome of their large&s;t burghs: which mu&s;t con&s;equently be
expo&s;ed to the ravages of this dreadful calamity.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FALL OF THE REICHENBACH&mdash;PASSAGE OF THE
SHEIDEC&mdash;VALLEY AND GLACIERS OF GRINDEL|WALD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Grindelwald, <DATE>Augu&s;t 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE left Meyringen this morning, cro&s;&s;ed the Aar,
and mounted the Sheidic through a beautiful fore&s;t
of beech, poplars, mountain-a&s;h, and pines. About two
miles from Meyringen we di&s;mounted at a &s;mall village, and
pa&s;&s;ed along &s;ome fields in order to view the fall of the
Reichenbach, which is de&s;ervedly celebrated for its variety
and beauty.</P>
<P>THE Reichenbach has its &s;ource at the foot of the Wetter|horn;
and rolls in numerous cataracts down the &s;teep &s;ides
of Mount Sheidec, until it unites with the Aar near Mey|ringen.
The fall of the Reichenbach may be divided into
three principal parts.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, which alone is u&s;ually vi&s;ited by travellers,
precipitates it&s;elf from an overhanging rock, is reduced into
&s;pray and foam, and in that &s;tate falls in a perpendicular co|lumn,
at lea&s;t from an elevation of two hundred feet, into
a natural ba&s;on, from which it overflows, and is &s;oon lo&s;t in
<PB N="289" REF="311">
the aby&s;s beneath. The rock it&s;elf is concave, arched,
totally bare, excepting its &s;ummit, which is feathered with
&s;hrubs; and being of black marble, forms a &s;triking con|tra&s;t
with the pure whitene&s;s of the de&s;cending foam. Part
of the &s;pray rebounds on the rock, and glides gently into
the ba&s;on in many a &s;ilvery current.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd cataract begins from the overflowing of the
ba&s;on; and is mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;een from a large tree
which impends on the &s;ides of the precipice. In this part
the torrent forms a &s;econd perpendicular column of water,
which is half ob&s;cured, as it da&s;hes through a cha&s;m of pro|jecting
rocks.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t point of view for &s;eeing the third cataract is in
a meadow at the bottom of the &s;econd. From that &s;ituation
the whole of Reichenbach &s;eems one immen&s;e water-fall:
the bottom of the fir&s;t, and the top of the &s;econd cataract,
being concealed by the intervening hills. From thence it
rolls nearly in a horizontal direction; is divided into two
&s;treams by a rocky i&s;land beautifully &s;prinkled with trees,
and impetuou&s;ly de&s;cends in two unequal bodies. It then
da&s;hes over broken crags of black marble, through groves of
beech, mountain-a&s;h, and pines, and rich grounds inter|&s;per&s;ed
with hamlets.</P>
<P>ON viewing the various parts of this &s;tupendous fall, I
was as much intere&s;ted and affected, as Ari&s;taeus is repre|&s;ented
by Virgil, when his mother Cyrene points out of him
<PB N="290" REF="312">

<P>WE next a&s;cended by the &s;ide of the Reichenbach, cro&s;&s;ed
that torrent over a bridge; and, having traver&s;ed &s;everal
plains, or rather undulating vallies, beautifully &s;prinkled
with a&s;h, poplar, and other large trees, we continued our
<PB N="291" REF="313">
route at the foot of &s;ome enormous mountains, which are
called by the general name of Wetterhorn<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;everal peaks of this mountain go under different appellations; and are not a&s;certained without much difficulty, the pea&s;ants u&s;ually mi&s;taking and confounding them. One is called the Wetter-horn, an|other the Nager-horn, a third the Engel-horn, and the highe&s;t point takes the deno|mination of Jungfrau-horn, or Virgin's-horn, for the &s;ame rea&s;on as the mountain of that name in the valley of Lauterbruen|n$n, becau&s;e its &s;ummit is inacce&s;&s;ible. Hence &s;everal travellers have mi&s;taken this peak for the real Jungfrau-horn.</P>
<P>I have mentioned th$&s;e circum&s;tances, in order to prevent the confu&s;ion of names puzzling future travellers as they once puz|zled me.</P>
<P>The word <HI>horn</HI> in German, which bears the &s;ame &s;ignification as in the Engli&s;h tongue, is applied to the highe&s;t peaks, as in French <HI>aiguille,</HI> or needle.</P></NOTE>, or <HI>Stormy Peak.</HI>
This enormous group, which forms the Wetterhorn, is pe|culiarly
&s;triking, as well from the naked maje&s;ty and gran|deur
of its rugged peaks, as from its being more in&s;ulated
than the neighbouring mountains, and becau&s;e, in pa&s;&s;ing
from Meyringen to Grindelwald, it pre&s;ents it&s;elf the fir&s;t of
this &s;tupendous chain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To tho&s;e who go from Grindelwald to Meyringen, the Wetterhorn is the la&s;t of this chain. Hence the traveller will not, perhaps, be &s;o much affected with its ma|je&s;ty and grandeur, as if he fir&s;t ob&s;erved it in a&s;cending from Meyringen. I mention this circum&s;tance, becau&s;e all de&s;criptions are <HI>comparative.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER having a&s;cended about three hours from the time
of our quitting Meyringen, we refre&s;hed our&s;elves and our
hor&s;es in a delightful vale &s;trewed with hamlets; a &s;loping
hill, adorned with variegated verdure and wood, on one &s;ide;
on the other, the Ro&s;enlavi and Schwartz-wald glaciers
&s;tretching between impending rocks; and before us the
highe&s;t point of the Wetterhorn lifting its pyramidical
top capped with eternal &s;now. As we were taking our re|pa&s;t,
we were &s;uddenly &s;tartled by a noi&s;e, like the &s;ound of
thunder; occa&s;ioned by a large body of &s;now falling from
the top of the mountain, which, in its precipitate de&s;cent,
<PB N="292" REF="314">
had the appearance of a torrent of water reduced almo&s;t into
&s;pray. The&s;e <HI>avalanches</HI> (as they are called) are &s;ometimes
attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences: for, when they
con&s;i&s;t of enormous ma&s;&s;es, they de&s;troy every thing in their
cour&s;e; and not unfrequently overwhelm even a whole vil|lage.
The be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t their effects being the fo|re&s;ts,
with which the alps abound; there is &s;carcely a village,
if &s;ituated at the foot of a mountain, that is not &s;heltered by
trees; which the inhabitants pre&s;erve with uncommon reve|rence,
as their common protector. Thus, what con&s;titutes
one of the principal beauties in the country, affords al&s;o &s;afe|ty
to the people.</P>
<P>WE continued our cour&s;e at the foot of the Wetterhorn,
which in this part is &s;o extremely perpendicular and tapering
as to appear like half of an immen&s;e pyramid. Here we
conceived it impo&s;&s;ible, that any &s;cenes could be more rude
and maje&s;tic than tho&s;e before us; but on reaching the top
of the Sheidec, we bur&s;t upon a view which &s;o far exceeded
them in wildne&s;s and horror, that we unanimou&s;ly exclaim|ed,
&startq;There is the <HI>Schreckhorn,</HI> or the <HI>Peak of Terror.</HI>&endq; The
de&s;cent from hence to Grindelwald is gentle but tedious:
that village, con&s;i&s;ting of numerous cottages, di&s;per&s;ed
over the plain and upon the ri&s;ing hills, exhibits an agree|able
and picture&s;que &s;cene, heightened at the &s;ame time by
a view of the vallies of ice, which &s;tretch along the &s;teep
&s;ides of the mountains in a regular curve, and are beautiful|ly
&s;kirted with wood.</P>
<P>THE two vallies of ice, which extend into the plain of
Grindelwald, are called the Superior and Inferior Glaciers.
<PB N="293" REF="315">
The former lies between the Wetterhorn and the Metten|berg;
the latter between the Mettenberg and Eger-horn.
The Mettenberg is the ba&s;e of the Schreckhorn; and the
Eger-horn, or <HI>Pointed peak,</HI> borders on the valley of Grindel|wald,
and &s;lopes gradually from barren rock and &s;now to
fertility and cultivation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">For a further account of this chain of alps, which are contiguous to the vallies of Grindelwald and Lauterbruennen, &s;ee Letter on the Chain of Alps ob&s;erved from Be$ne.</NOTE>.</P>

&s;allied forth this morning full of impatience; and arrived at
the bottom of the Inferior glacier, forming a maje&s;tic arch of
ice; from whence i&s;&s;ued a loud torrent of &s;now-water ju&s;t
melted. This glacier is compo&s;ed of numerous pyramids,
which are more elevated towards the plain; being from
about forty to fifty feet high, and gradually &s;hortening, un|til
they terminate in a broad &s;urface broken into deep and
wide cha&s;ms. We mounted a very difficult path at the edge
of the frozen region, occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;ing over the &s;teep and
craggy parts of rock almo&s;t perpendicular, along the very
&s;ides of the precipice: the danger of which makes me &s;hud|der
even now. This glacier is &s;everal miles in length, and is
&s;uppo&s;ed, by many travellers, to join the glacier of the Aar,
which I vi&s;ited in my expedition to the top of the Grim&s;el.
<PB N="294" REF="316">
But the reverend Mr. Wyttenbach of Berne, who has fre|quently
examined its direction from the adjacent heights,
a&s;&s;ured me, that tho&s;e two glaciers are &s;eparated from each
other by a chain of abrupt and perpendicular mountains.</P>
<P>AFTER having employed above two hours in a&s;cending,
we were prevented from continuing our progre&s;s by rugged
rocks, and a ri&s;ing hill of ice; our guide a&s;&s;uring us at the
&s;ame time, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to proceed any farther. Of
this we were by no means convinced; but not having any
conductor who could lead the way, and not daring to explore
the&s;e unknown regions by our&s;elves, we de&s;cended with
heavy hearts; much di&s;appointed, that what we had &s;een,
though certainly a very curious and &s;ublime &s;ight, did not
equal our expectations: and it added to our chagrin, on
being afterwards informed, that though we could &s;carcely
have proceeded further in the direction which we took, yet,
that if we had followed another path, we might have pene|trated
to the Superior glacier, and have reached the ba&s;e of
the Schreckhorn. In that part between the mountains, now
occupied by the Inferior glacier, there was formerly a road
which communicated with the Vallais, but is at pre&s;ent im|pa&s;&s;able;
and a &s;pot was pointed out to us, now covered with
ice, where once &s;tood a &s;mall chapel.</P>
<P>WHAT peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes the glacier of Grindel|wald
from that of the Furca, is, that the latter lies amid bar|ren
and craggy rocks, in a mo&s;t de&s;olate, dreary, and uninha|bited
country; whereas this valley of ice joins to a very fer|tile
plain, and borders upon cultivation: in other re&s;pects the
<PB N="295" REF="317">
Furca was a much more &s;triking object. Not far from this
glacier of Grindelwald, pines, willows, a&s;h, and oaks, grow
and come to perfection: and near the borders of the ice I
gathered &s;trawberries and wild cherries, and ob&s;erved hazel|nuts,
barberries, and mulberry-trees. The valley of Grin|delwald
is extremely fertile; it produces barley, rye, hay,
hemp, and fruit-trees in great abundance, and feeds above
two thou&s;and large cattle.</P>

<P>THE road from Grindelwalden to this place is good,
and we met a cart, which to us is become a remark|able
object, not having &s;een any thing that moves upon
wheels &s;ince we quitted Lucerne. The country is plea&s;ingly
diver&s;ified with hanging woods, immen&s;e rocks, deep preci|pices,
and violent torrents. But I &s;uppo&s;e you are by this

as the readers of Fingal to blue mi&s;ts and hollow winds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>A nearer and more intere&s;ting, but more difficult pa&s;&s;age, conducts over the Scheidee from Grindelwald to Lauterbru|ennen. In my &s;econd expedition into the&s;e parts I propo&s;ed traver&s;ing this pa&s;&s;age, and had actually &s;et off for that purpo&s;e; but a violent &s;hower obliging me to change my re&s;olution, I continued my journey along the &s;ame road as on the former occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It may be proper to apprize the traveller, that there are two Sheidees, the one &s;eparat|ing the vallies of Grindelwald and Meyrin|gen, the other tho&s;e of Grindelwald and Lau|terbruennen.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE valley of Lauterbruennen is embo&s;omed in the
mid&s;t of the alps. The we&s;tern boundary of the valley,
from which the Staubbach falls, would in any other country
be called an enormous mountain: it here appears only a
trifling hill in compari&s;on with the oppo&s;ite chain, of which
the highe&s;t point is the beautiful Jungfrau-horn, that
&s;tretches in a &s;emicircular direction, and overlooking the
adjacent peaks, ri&s;es to a &s;tupendous height.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="319">
WE are now lodged at the hou&s;e of the clergyman of
Lauterbruennen; a little village, or rather collection of cot|tages,
&s;prinkled, like tho&s;e of Grindelwald, about the valley
and acce&s;&s;ible parts of the hills. Near the hou&s;e, is the cele|brated
fall of the Staubbach, which I am ju&s;t returned from
viewing. This torrent rolls perpendicularly from &s;o con&s;i|derable
a height, as to re&s;olve it&s;elf into fine &s;pray; the
greate&s;t part of it falls clear of the overhanging mountain,
during its whole de&s;cent; but the remainder da&s;hes about
half way again&s;t a projection from the rock, and flies off
with great violence. The clergyman mea&s;ured, a &s;hort time
ago, its perpendicular height, and found it nine hundred and
thirty feet. The &s;un &s;hining in an oppo&s;ite direction, a
miniature rainbow was reflected towards the bottom of the
fall: while I &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, the rainbow a&s;&s;umed a
&s;emicircular figure; as I approached, the extreme points
gradually coincided, and formed a complete circle of the
mo&s;t lively and brilliant colours. In order to have a &s;till
finer view, I ventured nearer and nearer; the circle at
the &s;ame time becoming &s;maller and &s;maller; and as I
&s;tood quite under the fall, it &s;uddenly di&s;appeared. When
I looked up to the torrent, in this &s;ituation, it re&s;embled
a cloud of du&s;t: and from this circum&s;tance indeed it takes
its name; Staubbach &s;ignifying, in the German language,
a &s;pring of <HI>du&s;t.</HI> I paid for my curio&s;ity, by being extreme|ly
wet; but then I had the &s;atisfaction, at the &s;ame time,
of &s;eeing a rainbow in miniature: no uncommon phaeno|menon,
as it may be ob&s;erved in any ca&s;cade, upon which
the &s;un &s;hines directly in a certain po&s;ition. In the pre&s;ent
<PB N="298" REF="320">
in&s;tance, however, it was &s;ome con&s;olation to me, that the
object happened to be peculiarly &s;triking.</P>
<P>THE next morning we rode to the extremity of the vale,
in which there are &s;ome noble points of view, and a&s;cended
to the glaciers, which &s;tretch from the feet of the Breit-horn
and Gro&s;&s;-horn. In this delightful valley many &s;treams<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">From which circum&s;tance it receives its name, <HI>Lauterbruennen,</HI> in German, &s;ignify|ing <HI>many &s;prings.</HI></NOTE> of
the cleare&s;t water gu&s;h from the earth like &s;mall rivers, and
numberle&s;s torrents precipitate them&s;elves from the moun|tains.
I noticed two in particular which fall from a greater
height than even the Staubbach, but as their de&s;cent is not
&s;o direct, they are le&s;s extraordinary.</P>
<P>AFTER mounting above three hours, we reached a &s;mall
hut, which in &s;ummer is inhabited by herd&s;men, who make
excellent chee&s;es, and tend numerous herds of cows, goats,
and &s;wine. Here we fea&s;ted upon cold chamois, which our
ho&s;t had provided for us, and concluded our repa&s;t with a
de&s;ert of delicious cream. From thence we a&s;cended &s;till fur|ther,
with con&s;iderable difficulty arrived at the borders of
the glaciers, and were entirely &s;urrounded by rugged and
almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able rocks. We wi&s;hed to proceed; but our
ho&s;t a&s;&s;uring us, that we had but ju&s;t time to return before
night, we &s;at down clo&s;e to the ice, and contemplated, with
rapture and a&s;toni&s;hment, part of the great central chain of
the alps; rocks towering above rocks, and mountains ri&s;ing
above mountains, not more di&s;tingui&s;hed for their &s;tupen|dous
<PB N="299" REF="321">
heights, than for the immen&s;e variety and rudene&s;s of
their forms. One of the peaks, which is called the Gro&s;s-horn,
is of a pyramidal &s;hape, and capped with frozen
&s;now; another, the Breit-horn, is conical, and &s;eems crown|ed
with an enormous ma&s;s of tran&s;parent ice, from which
the reflection of the &s;un-beams were inexpre&s;&s;ibly beau|tiful.
But the mo&s;t elevated and mo&s;t maje&s;tic of the
whole group, is the Jungfrau-horn, or Virgin's-horn,
which takes its name of <HI>virgin,</HI> becau&s;e its &s;ummit is in|acce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE hollows between the mountains are filled with large
vallies of ice, broken into a great variety of &s;hapes; and &s;eve|ral
torrents bur&s;ting from the &s;now, and uniting in their
cour&s;e form the Wei&s;s-Lutchine, a river which rolls rapidly
through the valley of Lauterbruennen, joins the Schwartz-Lutchine,
which flows from Grindelwald, and falls into the
Aar. Many of the mountains are covered to a great height
with verdure, on which the eye repo&s;es with delight amid
the horrors of &s;uch wintry &s;cenes. We ob&s;erved al&s;o, at
con&s;iderable elevations, &s;everal &s;mall villages, the acce&s;s to
which mu&s;t be almo&s;t as difficult as to the glaciers to which
we a&s;cended.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING, however, the magnificence and
variety of this curious &s;cenery, and the uncommon phaeno|menon
of ice and &s;now in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, bordering on
fore&s;ts and cultivation; yet I mu&s;t again repeat, that the
ideas which we had previou&s;ly conceived, from exaggerated
<PB N="300" REF="322">
accounts, concerning the boundle&s;s extent and magnificent
appearance of the glaciers, were not &s;ufficiently an&s;wered.
It is remarkable, that every object in Switzerland has more
than gratified our expectations, except the glaciers; which
mu&s;t, neverthele&s;s, be con&s;idered as forming one of the mo&s;t
intere&s;ting phaenomena in the whole country. This di&s;ap|pointment
&s;eems to have been occa&s;ioned by the turgid
accounts which we had heard and read of the glaciers of
Grindelwald and Lauterbruennen; and we were led to
&s;uppo&s;e, that the glacier of the Furca was much inferior
in magnitude to tho&s;e of Grindelwald and Lauterbruen|nen;
when, in fact, it was in all re&s;pects equal, if not
&s;uperior, to them.</P>

<P>IN 1785, I was con&s;iderably more delighted and a&s;toni&s;h|ed
with the vallies of Grindelwald and Lauterbruennen than
in 1776; becau&s;e my imagination was not, in this as in the
fir&s;t in&s;tance, exalted by exaggerated de&s;criptions, and led to
expect more than could be reached, even by nature her&s;elf,
however prodigal in the&s;e her &s;ublime&s;t works. But the vallies
of ice &s;till appear to me incon&s;iderable objects, when viewed
at &s;ome di&s;tance, and compared with the &s;urrounding moun|tains,
who&s;e &s;ummits and &s;ides are clothed with va&s;t regions
of ice and &s;now. On a nearer approach they become more
intere&s;ting, particularly when they are broken into abrupt
<PB N="301" REF="323">
ridges, and immen&s;e cha&s;ms; and when their aggregate
ma&s;s, and numerous branches, are ob&s;erved from the &s;ur|rounding
heights. Still, however, the traveller may be di&s;|appointed,
who&s;e imagination has been previou&s;ly filled
with turgid de&s;criptions; or who apply to the vallies of ice
that &s;ublimity and magnificence, which are only due to the
alps above and around them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LAKES OF THUN AND BRIENTZ&mdash;PASSAGE OF
MOUNT GEMMI&mdash;BATHS OF LEUK.</HEAD>
<P>THE neare&s;t route from Lauterbruennen to the Baths
of Leuk, leads acro&s;s the mountains to Kander&s;teig.
It is called <HI>le chemin vert,</HI> or the <HI>green way,</HI> becau&s;e the rocks
are, for the mo&s;t part, covered with herbage. It is only
practicable to foot-pa&s;&s;engers; and I was informed by a
Swi&s;s gentleman who pa&s;&s;ed it, though &s;teep and diffic$lt,
that it is not dangerous. Its di&s;tance may be about three
leagues, and, to a per&s;on not wholly unaccu&s;tomed to alpine
pa&s;&s;ages, would require about five or &s;ix hours. A <HI>cha&s;&s;eur</HI>
would perform it in le&s;s than half the time. In my &s;econd
expedition, in 1785, I had propo&s;ed cro&s;&s;ing this way; but
was obliged to decline it, as I could not procure a guide who
was acquainted with the road.</P>
<P>I PURSUED, therefore, the u&s;ual route, which runs from
the entrance of the valley of Lauterbruennen, through a
fertile plain, between the lakes of Thun and Brientz. About
two leagues from Lauterbruennen, I came to the Aar, near
the &s;pot where it i&s;&s;ues from the lake of Brientz, and follow|ed
its cour&s;e until it entered the lake of Thun, &s;o called from
a town of that name, &s;ituated upon its north-we&s;tern extre|mity.
This lake is about four leagues long and one broad;
and, if we may judge from the &s;teepne&s;s of the mountains
<PB REF="325">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="303" REF="326">
with which it is bounded, mu&s;t be very deep: the borders
are richly variegated; and pre&s;ent &s;everal fine points of
view, greatly heightened by many rugged rocks ri&s;ing boldly
from the edge of the water. We coa&s;ted this lake, through
a delightful country, to the &s;mall village of Lei&s;ingen; then
a&s;cended to Ae&s;chi, from whence we looked down upon the
lakes of Thun and Brientz. In all the maps of Switzerland,
which have fallen under my ob&s;ervation, the&s;e two lakes are
repre&s;ented as if they extended almo&s;t in a &s;trait line; where|as
they are &s;ituated nearly at right angles to each other. You
may judge of their true po&s;ition, by the annexed engraving,
communicated to me by the Reverend Mr. Wyttenbach of
Berne.</P>
<P>HAVING de&s;cended from Ae&s;chi, we &s;oon entered the rich
valley of Frutigen, parallel to that of Lauterbruennen, and
enjoyed, for a con&s;iderable way, a pro&s;pect of tho&s;e glaciers
we had vi&s;ited the day before. This valley ends at the &s;mall
town of Frutigen: from thence commences that of Kander,
watered by a river of the &s;ame name, and bounded by mount
Kander. In all the&s;e vallies, the rudene&s;s and height of the
mountains, which almo&s;t enclo&s;e them, contra&s;ted with the
beauty and fruitfulne&s;s of the plains, always fertilized by
&s;ome lively torrent, form a thou&s;and picture&s;que &s;cenes, ever
changing, and impo&s;&s;ible to be de&s;cribed: and they are &s;till
further embelli&s;hed by the number of ruined ca&s;tles perched
upon points &s;eemingly inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE road continued good as far as the village of Kander|&s;teg;
from whence delicate travellers, who do not chu&s;e to
<PB N="304" REF="327">
mount a rugged a&s;cent, either on foot or on hor&s;eback, are
carried in an arm-chair &s;upported by means of poles upon
men's &s;houlders. We proceeded, however, on hor&s;eback,
having before rode up &s;teeper and more difficult paths. Af|ter
having a&s;cended about an hour and a half, we arrived at
the &s;ummit of the Kander, where a wooden cro&s;s marks the
entrance into the Vallais; then traver&s;ed a waving plain of
pa&s;ture, in which we ob&s;erved a few huts and &s;everal herds
of cattle; and at length reached a &s;ingle hou&s;e on the Gem|mi,
where we procured &s;ome refre&s;hment: here we &s;aw
nothing but immen&s;e rocks piled upon one another, with no
appearance of vegetation; and the weather was exceedingly
cold. We then pa&s;&s;ed over a large drift of &s;now, and came
to a lake called the Dauben See, about a league in circumfe|rence,
&s;upplied by a con&s;iderable torrent from a neighbour|ing
glacier. This lake has no vi&s;ible outlet; but doubtle&s;s
finds a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Vallais.</HI></P>
<P>THE chain of mountains, which here &s;eparates the canton
of Berne from the Vallais, is called the Gemmi: from the
point of which, overlooking and almo&s;t over-hanging the
Vallais, we had at once a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over
that fertile country, and the rugged alps of Savoy. The
mountain which we de&s;cended, is in many places almo&s;t per|pendicular;
and yet a hor&s;e-road has been formed in the
hard rock down this very formidable de&s;cent. It was begun
in 1736, and fini&s;hed in 1741, at the joint expence of the Val|lais,
and the canton of Berne: an a&s;toni&s;hing work! which
proves that nothing is impracticable to human indu&s;try.
More than a league has been blown up with gunpowder, and
<PB N="305" REF="328">
a way formed which &s;eems dangerous to tho&s;e, who are un|u&s;ed
to mountainous countries, or who&s;e heads are apt to turn
giddy. It is about nine feet broad, and hangs over the preci|pice:
in &s;ome parts, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, it is a hollow
way, open only at one &s;ide, the rock above projecting over it,
of the &s;ame breadth, and in the &s;ame direction. The effect
is peculiarly &s;ingular: for, as the road winds continually, the
&s;cene al&s;o continually changes; &s;o that one moment we com|manded
an exten&s;ive view, and the next were enclo&s;ed with
barren rock.</P>
<P>THE de&s;cent from the top to the plain, is about two
leagues: when you are arrived at the bottom, and look up,
you cannot ob&s;erve the &s;malle&s;t traces of a road; &s;o that a
&s;tranger would hardly believe it po&s;&s;ible, that a pa&s;&s;age has
been formed down the rock, until convinced by his own ex|perience.
About thirty years ago, the troops of Berne de|&s;cended
this road for the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the canton of Uri
again&s;t the inhabitants of the valley of Levino, who had re|volted;
and, what is almo&s;t incredible, they de&s;cended with
heavy artillery.</P>
<P>THIS place is famous for its hot medicinal &s;prings; and is
much frequented by invalids of various kinds, during this
&s;ea&s;on of the year: the patients either bathe or drink the
waters. As far as I can judge from the accounts which I
have received concerning their warmth, their analy&s;is, the
method of u&s;ing them, and their efficacy in curing the gout,
rheumati&s;m, ob&s;tructions, and cutaneous di&s;orders; they
&s;eem nearly to re&s;emble tho&s;e of Bath. There are &s;everal
<PB N="306" REF="329">
&s;prings, of different warmth and of different qualities: ac|cording
to the mo&s;t accurate experiments made by the Rev.
Mr. Wyttenbach, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermome|ter,
when plunged into the principal &s;ource, &s;tood at 115;
and at 120 in the &s;pring which flows near the bridge over
the Dala.</P>
<P>THE accommodations for the company are very incon|venient:
each per&s;on having for his own u&s;e a &s;mall apart|ment
not more than a few feet &s;quare; in which there
is ju&s;t room for a bed, a table, and two chairs. The
public dining-room is upon rather a larger &s;cale, as is al&s;o
an apartment where the company occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;em|ble.
Formerly the accommodations were tolerably good;
but unfortunately, in 1719, an <HI>avalanche</HI> fell with &s;uch
impetuo&s;ity from a neighbouring glacier, upon the vil|lage,
as to overwhelm the greate&s;t part of the hou&s;es and
the baths, and to de&s;troy a con&s;iderable number of the in|habitants.</P>
<P>THE company, con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons from different quar|ters
of Switzerland, are exceedingly affable and obliging:
in&s;omuch that &s;everal of them have invited us to their re|&s;pective
hou&s;es; and this invitation was made with that
openne&s;s and unaffected frankne&s;s &s;o peculiarly characteri&s;tic
of the Swi&s;s. We dined this morning at eleven; the bell for
&s;upper is now ringing, and it is &s;carce &s;even. The&s;e are
primitive hours: but we have travelling appetites; and,
provided we meet with refre&s;hment, the hour and place are
of little con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="330">
YOU are now probably drinking tea in your with|drawing
room at Bath, from whence you are enjoying that
beautiful pro&s;pect I have &s;o often admired. The &s;ituation of
this &s;pot is more romantic, and the waters perhaps not le&s;s
efficacious: yet this village contains only a few mi&s;erable
hou&s;es, while Bath is one of the fine&s;t towns in Europe. I
had a conver&s;ation to-day upon this topic, with a very in|genious
and well-informed gentleman of the Vallais. I ob|&s;erved
to him, that, con&s;idering the great credit and efficacy
of the&s;e waters, I could not forbear wondering, that the
chiefs of the republic had not con&s;idered the improvement
of the accommodations, an object worthy of their attention;
for, if they were rendered more convenient for the reception
of invalids, it would undoubtedly be the means of drawing a
great number of &s;trangers; and con&s;equently mu&s;t be highly
beneficial to the country. He a&s;&s;ured me, it had more than
once been in contemplation; but that &s;ome per&s;ons of great
credit and authority oppo&s;ed all improvements, upon a
principle &s;imilar to the policy of Lycurgus; conceiving that
a concour&s;e of &s;trangers would only &s;erve to introduce luxury
among the inhabitants, and in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;troy that &s;implicity
of manners, for which the <HI>Vallai&s;ans</HI> are &s;o remarkably di&s;|tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>How far the ignorance of a people contributes to their
true felicity? or how far a &s;implicity of manners may be
corrupted by <HI>national</HI> improvement? are que&s;tions which
have been much agitated; and will never be decided, &s;o long
as it &s;hall be held ju&s;t rea&s;oning to argue from the abu&s;e
again&s;t the u&s;e. But it will readily be allowed, that &s;uper|&s;tition
<PB N="308" REF="331">
is ever the companion of ignorance; and that a peo|ple
who are both ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
be benefited by an intercour&s;e with nations more improved
and enlightened than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WE walked to a &s;pot not far from hence, where a com|munication
has been formed with the village Albenen.
Where the mountain inclines towards a &s;lope, a foot-path
has been cut; but in tho&s;e parts where the rock is directly
perpendicular, ladders are placed; and the pea&s;ants a&s;cend
and de&s;cend with heavy burdens upon their &s;houlders. We
counted &s;even of the&s;e ladders. I mention this circum&s;tance,
not as being an object &s;o remarkable, perhaps, as is repre|&s;ented
by &s;ome travellers; but as it will convey to you an

<HEAD TYPE="sub">REPUBLIC OF THE VALLAIS&mdash;CARDINAL SCHINNER
&mdash;TOWN OF SION&mdash;MARTIGNY&mdash;ST. MAURICE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Sion, <DATE>Augu&s;t 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SION being nearly the point where the German lan|guage
terminates, and where the French begins; the
natives in this part of the Vallais con&s;equently &s;peak both
tongues. We &s;et out this morning at five, and came down
a very &s;teep valley to Leuk, a &s;mall town built upon an emi|nence
near the Rhone: that river is here very rapid; and,
if we may judge by the breadth of the channel, often over|flows
its banks. We cro&s;&s;ed it at this place, and continued
for &s;ome way through a fore&s;t of firs, till we again pa&s;&s;ed the
river to Siders: from thence we coa&s;ted its banks to Sion,
the capital of the Vallais.</P>
<P>THERE is another road leading from the Baths of Leuk
to Siders, which I traver&s;ed in 1785, more &s;teep and incom|modious,
but far more intere&s;ting to the traveller, who
delights in picture&s;que views. It is called the <HI>galleries;</HI> is
cut along the &s;ides of an abrupt and rugged rock, in a zig|zag
direction, and protected by a wooden railling, which
overhangs a dreadful aby&s;s, &s;o deep and ob&s;cure, that the
river Dala, which rolls impetuou&s;ly through it, is neither
&s;een nor heard. The oppo&s;ite chain of mountains is clothed
with dark fore&s;ts, enlivened with pa&s;tures, and inter&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="310" REF="333">
with occa&s;ional villages, which are &s;ituated one above the
other, to a con&s;iderable height, and &s;eem &s;carcely acce&s;&s;ible
but to foot pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>THIS tract of country called the Vallais, &s;tretches from
ea&s;t to we&s;t about a hundred miles; and contains about
100,000 inhabitants, who all profe&s;s the Roman Catholic re|ligion.
It is divided into Upper and Lower Vallais: the for|mer
reaches from the Furca to the Morge, below Sion; and
the latter from that river to St. Gingou, &s;ituated upon the
lake of Geneva.</P>
<P>THE Upper Vallais is &s;overeign of the Lower Vallais; and
compri&s;es &s;even independent <HI>dixains</HI> or commonwealths;
namely, Sion, Goms, Brieg, Vi&s;p, Leuk, Raren, and Siders:
of the&s;e Sion is ari&s;tocratical, and the others democratical.
They are called <HI>Dixains,</HI> becau&s;e the Upper Vallais being
divided into &s;even, and the Lower into three di&s;tricts, each
divi&s;ion is a <HI>dixain,</HI> or <HI>tenth</HI> of the whole.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Sion was formerly ab&s;olute &s;overeign over
the greate&s;t part of the Vallais; but his authority is at pre&s;ent
limited to the following prerogatives. He has the &s;ole
power of pardoning criminals; and &s;igns all the warrants for
execution: the money is coined in his name, and with the
arms of the republic. In his acts he &s;tiles him&s;elf bi&s;hop of
Sion, prince of the German empire, and count and praefect
of the Vallais: in days of high ceremony he dines in pub|lic,
and is waited upon by the fir&s;t noble of the Vallais, who
is hereditary trea&s;urer. He nominates the bailifs or gover|nors
<PB N="311" REF="334">
of the two bailliages of Martigny and Arden; and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
con&s;iderable influence from his patronage of church
preferment. Upon a vacancy in the &s;ee, the canons of the
chapter of Sion pre&s;ent from their own body four candidates,
from whom one is appointed bi&s;hop by the <HI>Land&s;rath,</HI> or
general diet.</P>
<P>THE &s;even dixains form, conjointly with the bi&s;hop, the
republic of the Vallais; and all affairs are tran&s;acted in the
diet, called <HI>Land&s;rath,</HI> which meets twice every year at Sion.
This a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ts of nine voices; the bi&s;hop; the <HI>lands-hauptmann,</HI>
who is cho&s;en or confirmed by the diet every
two years; and the &s;even communities. The bi&s;hop pre|&s;ides,
and the <HI>lands-hauptmann</HI> collects the votes; and all
re&s;olutions are decided by the majority. Each dixain, al|though
it has but one vote, &s;ends as many deputies as it
plea&s;es: they generally con&s;i&s;t of four;&mdash;a judge, a banneret,
a captain, and a lieutenant. The judge and the lieutenant
are appointed every two years; the two others hold their
offices for life. In all civil cau&s;es of a certain importance,
an appeal lies to the diet in the la&s;t re&s;ort, from the inferior
courts of ju&s;tice in the &s;everal dixains. Thus, by the in&s;ti|tution
of this &s;upreme council, the &s;everal communities in
this country are firmly united, and form in conjunction one
body politic, or republic, for the general affairs of the na|tion.
In other ca&s;es, each of the commonwealths is governed
by its own particular laws and cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>BOTH the Upper and Lower Vallais were formerly de|pendent
upon the bi&s;hop of Sion; but the inhabitants of the
<PB N="312" REF="335">
two di&s;tricts united in order to limit his power; and, having
&s;ucceeded in the attempt, they quarrelled among them&s;elves
for the &s;uperiority. A bloody war en&s;ued; which termi|nated,
in 1475, by the total defeat of the Lower Vallai&s;ans.
Since that period, they have continued &s;ubject to the Upper
Vallais; enjoying however &s;ome very con&s;iderable pri|vileges.</P>
<P>THE republic of the Vallais is an ally of the thirteen can|tons;
and has formed a particular league with the &s;even
Catholic cantons, for the defence of their common religion.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hops of Sion had formerly a con&s;iderable in|fluence
over the political affairs of Switzerland; and Matthew
Schinner, the cardinal bi&s;hop, is famous in hi&s;tory for his
great abilities, his daring &s;pirit of intrigue, and his turbulent
and re&s;tle&s;s ambition. He was born at Milbach, in the dix|ain
of Goms; and in 1500 was appointed bi&s;hop of Sion. It
was entirely owing to his repre&s;entations and influence,
that the Swi&s;s troops gave a &s;ingular in&s;tance of infidelity
to their public engagements, by breaking a treaty which
they had ju&s;t contracted with Francis the Fir&s;t. When
that monarch invaded the Milane&s;e, he endeavoured to gain
the Swi&s;s; who having taken the duke of Milan under their
protection, were the only ob&s;tacles to the progre&s;s of his
arms. After much he&s;itation, they were prevailed upon, by
the offer of con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idies, to enter into a treaty: but
the alliance was no &s;ooner concluded, than the cardinal of
Sion per&s;uaded them to break it, and continue the war.
The Swi&s;s hi&s;torians however record, with triumph, the
<PB N="313" REF="336">
patriotic conduct of two officers upon this occa&s;ion; who,
remon&s;trating again&s;t this breach of faith, drew off eight
thou&s;and troops; and returning to Switzerland, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure retrieved the honour of the nation. The re|mainder
of the army, in&s;tigated by the plau&s;ible and artful
eloquence of the cardinal, engaged Francis the Fir&s;t near
Marignano, in one of the mo&s;t furious and ob&s;tinate battles
that was fought during the bloody wars of Italy. Night
alone put a &s;top to the engagement, without &s;eparating the
combatants; both armies were blended upon the field of
battle: and Francis &s;lept upon the carriage of a cannon, at
no great di&s;tance from a battalion of the enemy. At day|break
the Swi&s;s renewed the charge with their u&s;ual cou|rage,
and were received with equal bravery. At length the
intrepidity of the king, and the de&s;perate valour of the
French, ro&s;e &s;uperior to the furious and repeated attacks of
the Swi&s;s; who retreated to Milan, leaving Francis in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the field of battle: an advantage, however, which
he gained by the lo&s;s of his brave&s;t troops.</P>
<P>THE cardinal, actuated by the mo&s;t inveterate enmity to
the French, occa&s;ioned al&s;o, by his &s;ole intrigues, the lo&s;s
of the Milane&s;e to Francis. Lautrec, in the year 1521, com|manded
a body of 12,000 Swi&s;s, who formed the principal
&s;trength of his army. On the other &s;ide, the cardinal had
obtained, by his influence over his countrymen, a &s;ecret
levy of the like number, to join the enemies of France: and
thus, for the fir&s;t time, the Swi&s;s were &s;een combating under
oppo&s;ite banners, and ready to commit ho&s;tilities again&s;t
each other. Upon this occa&s;ion the cantons immediately
<PB N="314" REF="337">
di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers, with peremptory orders for the
Swi&s;s in both armies, to return to their country. The car|dinal
bribed the me&s;&s;engers to conceal the&s;e orders from the
Swi&s;s in the army of the confederates, and to deliver them
only to tho&s;e who were in the French &s;ervice. The latter
obeyed accordingly; and this de&s;ertion weakening the army
of Lautrec, Milan, and the principal towns, &s;urrendered to
the confederates. Soon after this additional in&s;tance of his
intrigues and influence, the cardinal ended his turbulent life
in the conclave, which a&s;&s;embled on the death of Leo the
Tenth, for the election of a new pope.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of this part of the Vallais are much
&s;ubject to <HI>goiters,</HI> or large excre&s;cences of fle&s;h that grow
from the throat, and often increa&s;e to a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize:
but what is more extraordinary, idiocy al&s;o remarkably
abounds among them. I &s;aw many in&s;tances of both kinds
as I pa&s;&s;ed through Sion: &s;ome idiots were ba&s;king in the
&s;un with their tongues out, and their heads hanging down;
exhibiting the mo&s;t affecting &s;pectacle of intellectual imbe|cility
that can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived. The cau&s;es which
produce a frequency of the&s;e phaenomena in this country,
is a curious que&s;tion, which very much excites my in|quiry:
but I &s;hall defer giving my opinion, until I &s;hall
have obtained farther information.</P>
<P>THE weather in this enclo&s;ed vale is &s;o exceedingly hot,
that I am at this in&s;tant, although the evening is far ad|vanced,
quite oppre&s;&s;ed with the extreme &s;ultrine&s;s. This lan|guid
heat is probably one of the cau&s;es, which occa&s;ion the
<PB N="315" REF="338">
inconceivable lazine&s;s and indolence of the inhabitants:
much, however, mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be attributed to the
richne&s;s of the &s;oil; which prevents labour by almo&s;t &s;pon|taneou&s;ly
producing the fruits of the earth. In fact, the
people a&s;&s;i&s;t nature very little: we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal vineyards,
in which the vines were &s;uffered to trail upon the ground;
whereas, if the branches were properly rai&s;ed and &s;upported,
the owner would be well rewarded by the &s;uperior quantity
and quality of their produce.</P>
<P>THE uncleanline&s;s of the common people is di&s;gu&s;ting
beyond expre&s;&s;ion. I have ju&s;t been holding a conver&s;ation
upon this &s;ubject with my landlord; who, though him&s;elf a
notorious example, yet &s;everely cen&s;ured the dirtine&s;s of his
countrymen; and &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ign it as one cau&s;e of <HI>goiters.</HI>
This a&s;&s;ertion induced me to examine the per&s;on of my ho&s;t
with &s;omewhat more attention, in order to di&s;cover how it
&s;tood with him&s;elf in that re&s;pect; and I was rather di&s;ap|pointed
to find, that he proved an exception to his own re|mark.
Let me not, however, be under&s;tood as in&s;inuating
that the inhabitants in general are either goitrous, indolent,
or dirty; like that traveller who a&s;&s;erted, that all the women
of a certain town were crooked, red-haired, and pitted with
the &s;mall-pox, becau&s;e his landlady happened to be &s;o. In|deed,
I look upon national reflections in general, to proceed
from the narrowe&s;t and mo&s;t illiberal turn of mind; and
have always been cautious not to judge of the phy&s;ical, or
moral character of any people from a partial and &s;uperficial
view. But as to the &s;ingular prevalency in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance,
<PB REF="339">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="316" REF="340">
of goiters and idiocy, it is a fact which I can venture
to affirm, both from my own experience, and from various
conver&s;ations I have held with &s;everal men of learning and
ob&s;ervation of this country; and the general dirtine&s;s and in|dolence
of the common people are too notorious to e&s;cape
the ob&s;ervation of the mo&s;t carele&s;s traveller.</P>
<P>SION is &s;ituated near the Rhone, at the foot of three in|&s;ulated
rocks, that ri&s;e immediately from the plain. The
highe&s;t, called Tourbillon, &s;upports the ruins of the old epi&s;|copal
palace, &s;till containing two or three untenanted apart|ments,
in one of which are the portraits of the &s;everal
bi&s;hops. On the &s;econd rock, denominated Valeria, are ob|&s;erved
the remains of the old cathedral, and a few hou&s;es
belonging to the canons. On Mayoria, the third rock, &s;tands
the epi&s;copal palace, an antient edifice of &s;tone, built in 1547.
On &s;eeing the apartments, I was greatly &s;truck with their plain|ne&s;s,
and could not avoid reflecting with plea&s;ure on the &s;impli|city
of manners, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prevail in this country;
when the rooms, inhabited by the &s;overeign, in&s;tead of be&s;peak|ing
the magnificence of a court, are &s;carcely &s;uperior to the
dwelling of a pea&s;ant. Two apartments principally engaged
my attention. The fir&s;t is that in which the Diet a&s;&s;embles:
at the upper end are two armed chairs for the bi&s;hop and the
<HI>lands-hauptmann,</HI> and on each &s;ide a row of &s;maller &s;eats for
the deputies of the &s;even <HI>dixains.</HI> The other apartment is
the hall, in which the bi&s;hop holds his court, like the feudal
lords of antient times: at the further extremity is a rai&s;ed
&s;eat, called a throne, &s;urrounded by a wooden balu&s;trade;
<PB N="317" REF="341">
and, as an incitement to wi&s;dom and impartiality, the figures
of Ju&s;tice, and the &s;tory of Solomon's judgment, are coar&s;ely
painted upon the walls.</P>
<P>SION is an antient town, and was formerly the capital of
the <HI>Seduni,</HI> who inhabited this part of the country in the
time of Julius Cae&s;ar. A few remaining in&s;criptions &s;till
prove its antiquity; and, among others, &s;o obliterated that I
was not able to decypher them, I ob&s;erved one which is more
legible: it is in honour of the emperor Augu&s;tus, during his
eleventh con&s;ul&s;hip. In this in&s;cription the town is called
<HI>Civitas Sedunorum.</HI></P>
<P>AT Sion we parted with our hor&s;es and guides, who had
accompanied us from Altdorf; and procured a piece of luxury,
to which we had been for &s;ome time unaccu&s;tomed; I mean
a coach. But, notwith&s;tanding the concentrated heat of the
climate, and the great &s;ultrine&s;s of the air, I prefer riding or
walking; as by that means I enjoy a more unob&s;tructed view of
the country: and indeed the &s;cenes are &s;o beautiful, and &s;o per|petually
changing, that the attention is every moment engaged
by a variety of new objects that &s;trongly demand admiration.</P>
<P>UPON entering the Lower Vallais, I perceived as much
uncleanline&s;s, but a greater appearance of indu&s;try; and I
am informed, that the natives are not altogether &s;o indolent
as the inhabitants of Sion and its environs. This imputation
of indolence will not hold good with re&s;pect to all the in|habitants
of the Upper Vallais: for in the ea&s;tern part of
that di&s;trict, which we entered after having cro&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="318" REF="342">
Furca, the &s;oil, though far inferior in richne&s;s and fertility,
was much better cultivated; and the people &s;eemed indu&s;|trious.
Some phy&s;ical rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this differ|ence;
for, <HI>there</HI> the weather is not &s;o &s;ultry, the water is
not unwhole&s;ome, and the air is remarkably &s;alutary. Ac|cordingly,
upon our fir&s;t entering the Vallais, we did not ob|&s;erve
any of tho&s;e goitrous per&s;ons or idiots, who &s;truck us
&s;o much in the midland parts.</P>
<P>WE &s;topped at the village of Martigny, which, according
to antiquarians, was the antient <HI>Octodurum.</HI> It is &s;aid, that
near this place may be traced the &s;ite of Sergius Galba's
camp, one of Julius Cae&s;ar's lieutenants, who was &s;ent by
that general to &s;ubdue the <HI>Veragri,</HI> the <HI>Nantuates,</HI> and the
<HI>Seduni;</HI> the antient inhabitants of the&s;e di&s;tricts. It &s;eems
evident indeed from Cae&s;ar's de&s;cription, in the third book
of his Commentaries, that <HI>Octodurum</HI> could not be far from
the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Martigny; which &s;tands in a &s;mall
plain, encircled by high mountains, and divided by the
Dran&s;e, that falls into the Rhone. I cannot however a&s;cer|tain
from my own ob&s;ervation, whether any traces of a Ro|man
encampment &s;till remain; nor could I gain the lea&s;t
information from the inhabitants; &s;o that the conjecture
concerning the &s;ituation of <HI>Octodurum</HI> re&s;ts only upon the
faith of antiquarians, and on the general po&s;ition of the
country.</P>
<P>MARTIGNY is a place much frequented by travellers: it
leads to the valley of Chamouny, to St. Maurice and the lake
of Geneva, and is the pa&s;&s;age of the merchandize, which is
<PB N="319" REF="343">
conveyed over the Great St. Bernard into Italy. Near Mar|tigny
we pa&s;&s;ed under the maje&s;tic ruins of La Bathia, an old
epi&s;copal ca&s;tle, &s;tanding upon the &s;ummit of a craggy rock,
and impending over the impetuous Dran&s;e. The road from
hence to St. Maurice runs under a chain of rocks, the Rhone
flowing at a &s;mall di&s;tance through the middle of a fertile
vale. Having cro&s;&s;ed the Trient, a turbid torrent which
i&s;&s;ues from a narrow and ob&s;cure glen, remarkable for its
rugged and romantic &s;cenery, we arrived at the Pi&s;&s;e-Vache,
a cataract much noticed by travellers. The characteri&s;tic
beauty of this fall is, that it &s;eems to bur&s;t from a cleft in
the middle of the rock, through hanging &s;hrubs that &s;tart
abruptly from the crevices, and forms a perpendicular co|lumn
of water about two hundred feet in height. The
body of water being very ample, and the elevation not &s;o
con&s;iderable as to reduce it entirely into &s;pray, render the ef|fect
very &s;triking. I enjoyed al&s;o the additional plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing the &s;un ri&s;e oppo&s;ite to this water-fall. The regular
expan&s;ion of the rays enlightening the different parts of the
column of water; and the gradual de&s;cent of the rainbow
formed by the &s;pray, were inexpre&s;&s;ibly beautiful. The&s;e
torrents are my delight: but perhaps they recur too often in
my letters to continue to be yours. Formerly travellers pa&s;|&s;ed
clo&s;e to the Pi&s;&s;e-Vache; but a few years ago part of the
rock falling down totally ob&s;tructed the road, which now runs
through the middle of the valley. I now traver&s;ed on foot,
not without &s;ome difficulty, amid the fallen fragments, where,
on a former occa&s;ion, I had pa&s;&s;ed in a carriage.</P>
<P>AT the extremity of the Lower Vallais, the two chains of
mountains that bound this country, approach towards the
<PB N="320" REF="344">
Rhone, which nearly fills the interval between them. In
this &s;pot is &s;ituated the town of St. Maurice, built almo&s;t to|tally
upon the rock, at the foot of &s;ome &s;teep mountains, and
at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the river. Its antient appellation
was <HI>Agaunum:</HI> it takes that of St. Maurice from an abbey,
erected in the beginning of the &s;ixth century, by Sigi&s;mond
king of Burgundy, in honour of a &s;aint, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to
have &s;uffered martyrdom in this place. This &s;aint was the
leader of the famous Theban legion, which is recorded to
have been ma&s;&s;acred by order of the Emperor Maximin, for
not renouncing Chri&s;tianity. This hi&s;tory has given ri&s;e to
much controver&s;y: while &s;ome authors have treated it as a
mere forgery; others have contended for its authenticity,
with as much warmth and zeal, as if the truth of Chri&s;tiani|ty
depended upon the deci&s;ion. Without entering into the
merits of the controver&s;y; I cannot but remark, that the
cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity has &s;uffered more from weak and im|prudent
defenders, than from the &s;harpe&s;t attacks of its mo&s;t
inveterate adver&s;aries. Indeed, the que&s;tion concerning the
number and &s;ufferings of the martyrs, has occa&s;ioned much
idle di&s;putation: for, reduce the popular accounts of both as
low as probability can rea&s;onably carry them, there will &s;till
remain &s;ufficient evidence of the wonderful con&s;tancy and
calm re&s;olution of tho&s;e primitive victims: and whether a
hundred thou&s;and, or only fifty, &s;uffered for the cau&s;e of
Chri&s;tianity, it will equally &s;tand upon the &s;ame firm and
immoveable foundation. Nor is the inquiry more material
concerning the motives that actuated its powerful and cruel
adver&s;aries. It matters not whether Decius ordered the
Chri&s;tians to be ma&s;&s;acred, becau&s;e they had been favoured
<PB N="321" REF="345">
by his predece&s;&s;or Philip, or from his attachment to the Pa|gan
rites; whether Maximin per&s;ecuted them from intere&s;t|ed
motives; Diocle&s;ian as introducing innovations in his go|vernment;
or whether Con&s;tantine protected them from
conviction or policy. For the truth of Chri&s;tianity is in
no re&s;pect affected either by the imprudence of its early
profe&s;&s;ors (if with any they were ju&s;tly chargeable) or
the political rea&s;ons that influenced the conduct of tho&s;e
emperors.</P>
<P>A FEW Roman in&s;criptions, chiefly &s;epulchral, and two
defaced columns, are the only uncontroverted remains of the
antiquity of St. Maurice. It is principally di&s;tingui&s;hed as
being the chief entrance from the canton of Berne into the
Vallais. This entrance is formed by a narrow pa&s;s, &s;o
&s;trongly fortified by nature, that a handful of men might
defend it again&s;t a con&s;iderable army.</P>
<P>THE &s;tone bridge over the Rhone is much admired for its
bold projection: it is of a &s;ingle arch, and the &s;pan is a hun|dred
and thirty feet. Half of this bridge belongs to the Val|lais,
and the remainder to the canton of Berne.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Trient, <DATE>Augu&s;t 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now writing from the village of Trient, on my way
to Mont Blanc and the alps of Savoy. From the moun|tain
of the Furca, its ea&s;tern boundary, two va&s;t ranges of
alps enclo&s;e the Vallais: the &s;outhern chain &s;eparates it from
the Milane&s;e, Piedmont, and part of Savoy; the northern di|vides
it from the canton of Berne. The&s;e two chains, in
their various windings, form &s;everal &s;mall valleys, watered
by numerous torrents that ru&s;h into the Rhone, as it tra|ver&s;es
the whole di&s;trict from the Furca to St. Maurice. A
country thus entirely enclo&s;ed within high alps, and con|&s;i&s;ting
of plains, elevated valleys, and lofty mountains, mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily exhibit a great variety of &s;ituations, climates, and
productions. Accordingly, the Vallais pre&s;ents to the cu|rious
traveller a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pro&s;pects, as beautiful as
they are diver&s;ified. Vineyards; rich pa&s;ture-grounds co|vered
with cattle; corn, flax, fruit-trees, and fore&s;ts, occa|&s;ionally
bordered by naked rocks, the &s;ummits whereof are
crowned with everla&s;ting &s;now. This &s;trong and &s;triking
contra&s;t between the pa&s;toral and the &s;ublime, the cultivated
and the wild, cannot but affect the mind of an ob&s;erver with
the mo&s;t plea&s;ing emotions.</P>
<P>As to the productions of the Vallais; they mu&s;t evident|ly
vary, according to the great diver&s;ity of climates, by
<PB N="323" REF="347">
which this country is &s;o peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed. It &s;upplies
more than &s;ufficient wine and corn for interior con&s;ump|tion:
and indeed a con&s;iderable quantity of both are yearly
exported; the &s;oil in the midland and lower di&s;tricts being
exceedingly rich and fertile. In the plain, where the heat
is collected and confined between the mountains, the harve&s;t
is u&s;ually fini&s;hed in July: whereas, in the more elevated
parts, barely is the only grain that can be cultivated with
any &s;ucce&s;s; and the crop is &s;eldom cut before November.
About Sion, the fig, the melon, and all the other fruits of
Italy, come to perfection: in con&s;equence of this &s;ingular
variety of climates, I ta&s;ted in the &s;ame day, &s;trawberries,
cherries, plums, pears, and grapes; each of them the <HI>na|tural</HI>
growth of the country.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to manufactures; there are none of any
con&s;equence; and indeed the general ignorance of the peo|ple
is no le&s;s remarkable than their indolence; &s;o that they
may be con&s;idered, in regard to knowledge and improve|ments,
as &s;ome centuries behind the Swi&s;s, who are certainly
a very enlightened nation. The pea&s;ants &s;eldom endeavour
to meliorate tho&s;e lands where the &s;oil is originally bad; nor
to draw the mo&s;t advantage from tho&s;e which are uncom|monly
fertile: having few wants, and being &s;atisfied with the
&s;pontaneous gifts of nature, they enjoy her ble&s;&s;ings without
much con&s;idering in what manner to improve them.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take leave of the Vallais, I &s;hall communicate
to you the re&s;ult of my inquiries concerning the cau&s;es,
which contribute to render goitrous per&s;ons and idiots &s;o re|markably
common in the&s;e parts: premi&s;ing, at the &s;ame
<PB N="324" REF="348">
time, that I mu&s;t &s;tand greatly in need of your candour,
when you peru&s;e the following con&s;iderations on a &s;ubject &s;o
extremely complicated; and on which &s;o many different opi|nions
have been advanced by naturali&s;ts and phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>FIRST, with re&s;pect to goiters. The notion that &s;now-water
occa&s;ions the&s;e excre&s;cences, &s;eems totally void of
foundation. For on that &s;uppo&s;ition, why are they common
in the midland and lower parts, and extremely unfrequent
in the higher regions of Switzerland; and particularly what
rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the natives of tho&s;e places that
lie mo&s;t contiguous to the glaciers, and who drink no other
water than what de&s;cends immediately from tho&s;e immen&s;e
re&s;ervoirs of ice and &s;now, are not &s;ubject to this malady?
Why are the inhabitants of tho&s;e countries in which there
is no &s;now, afflicted with it? For, the&s;e guttural tumours are
to be found in the environs of Naples, in the i&s;land of Su|matra,
and at Patna and Purnea, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, where
&s;now is unknown.</P>
<P>BUT as it would be needle&s;s to mention the various opi|nions
on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent confine my&s;elf to
what, from repeated inquiries, from my own particular ob&s;er|vations,
and from po&s;itive facts, appears to be the <HI>primary</HI>
cau&s;e of goiters. The &s;prings that &s;upply drink to the na|tives
are impregnated with a calcareous matter, called in
Switzerland <HI>tuf</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>The Porus of the older authors.</L>

<PB N="325" REF="349">
in Derby&s;hire, &s;o minutely di&s;&s;olved as not in the lea&s;t
to affect the tran&s;parency of the water. Will it be deemed
improbable, that the impalpable particles of this &s;ub&s;tance,
thus di&s;&s;olved, &s;hould introduce them&s;elves into the glands of
the throat, and produce goiters? I ground this opinion on the
following ob&s;ervations and facts.</P>
<P>To &s;peak in general: during my travels through Eu|rope,
I never failed to ob&s;erve that <HI>tuf,</HI> or this calcareous de|po&s;ition,
abounds in all tho&s;e di&s;tricts wherein goiters are
common. I noticed goitrous per&s;ons and much <HI>tuf</HI> in Der|by&s;hire,
in various parts of the Vallais, in the Valteline, at
Lucerne, Friburgh, and Berne, near Aigle and Bex, in &s;eve|ral
places of the Pays de Vaud, near Dre&s;den, in the vallies
of Savoy and Piedmont, near Turin and Milan.</P>
<P>To de&s;cend to particular in&s;tances. The inhabitants of
Friburgh, Berne, and Lucerne, are much &s;ubject to guttural
excre&s;cences. With re&s;pect to Friburgh, I ob&s;erved that one
of the principal &s;prings which &s;upplies the town with water
i&s;&s;ues from a neighbouring &s;tone-quarry, and has formed
large depo&s;itions of <HI>tuf</HI> on the rock from which it bubbles.
The pipes, al&s;o, which convey water to the public fountains
at Berne, are extremely charged with the &s;ame calcareous
&s;ediment; and a gentleman, on who&s;e veracity I can depend,
a&s;&s;ured me, that he is &s;ubject to a &s;mall &s;welling in the
throat, which u&s;ually increa&s;es in winter, when he is
chiefly re&s;ident at Berne, and dimini&s;hes in &s;ummer, on
his removal to other places, where the waters are not loaded
with <HI>tuf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="350">
I WAS, moreover, informed by General Pfiffer, that at Lu|cerne
all the waters, excepting one &s;pring, are impregnated
with <HI>tuf,</HI> and that the natives, who dwell near that &s;pring,
are much le&s;s &s;ubject to goiters than the other inhabitants;
that the &s;ame difference is ob&s;erved among the members of
the &s;ame family, between tho&s;e who drink no water but
what is drawn from that &s;pring, and the others who do not
u&s;e that precaution. The General &s;hewed me al&s;o the tin
ve&s;&s;el, in which water was every morning boiled for his u&s;e,
and which was &s;o &s;peedily and thickly incru&s;tated as to ren|der
it nece&s;&s;ary to have it clean&s;ed twice a week. The water
which yields this depo&s;ition, is as tran&s;parent as chry&s;tal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Although it appears that wherever there are goiters there is tuf-&s;tone; yet the rever&s;e is by no means true, that wherever the waters depo&s;it tuf, there are <HI>always</HI> goiters. For perhaps the natives do not drink of the &s;prings which are loaded with <HI>tuf;</HI> or that &s;ub&s;tance is not &s;ufficient|ly di&s;&s;olved in the waters; ab&s;olute &s;olution being, perhaps, nece&s;&s;ary to produce the&s;e &s;wellings.</NOTE>.
I may add likewi&s;e, that I vi&s;ited many places which border
upon tho&s;e di&s;tricts wherein goiters and <HI>tuf</HI> are frequent, and
which have preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;ituation and climate, yet
who&s;e inhabitants were not goitrous, and where I did not
ob&s;erve any appearance of <HI>tuf.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the &s;tronge&s;t proof, in favour of this opinion, is de|rived
from the following facts. A &s;urgeon, whom I met at
the Baths of Leuk, informed me, that he had not unfre|quently
extracted concretions of <HI>tuf-&s;tone</HI> from &s;everal goi|ters;
and that from one in particular, which &s;uppurated, he
had taken &s;everal flat pieces, each about half an inch long.
He added, that the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance is found in the &s;tomachs
of cows, and in the goitrous tumors to which even the dogs
<PB N="327" REF="351">
of the country are &s;ubject. The &s;ame gentleman a&s;&s;ured me,
that in the cour&s;e of an exten&s;ive practice, he had dimini&s;hed
and cured the goiters of many young per&s;ons by emollient
liquors and external applications; that his principal method,
in order to prevent them in future, con&s;i&s;ted in removing the
patients from the places where the &s;prings are impregnated
with <HI>tuf;</HI> and, if that could not be contrived, by forbidding
the u&s;e of water which was not purified. He confirmed the
report, that infants are occa&s;ionally born with guttural &s;wel|lings;
particularly tho&s;e who&s;e parents are goitrous; and
remarked, that one of his own children had at its birth a goi|ter
as large as an egg, although neither he nor his wife, who
were both foreigners<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the former in&s;tance, goiters may, though perhaps erroneou&s;ly, be e&s;teemed hereditary; but in the latter, where the parents are both foreigners and not goi|trous, can &s;carcely be derived from any other cau&s;e than the aliment of the mo|ther.</NOTE>, were afflicted with that malady. He
had di&s;&s;ipated it by external remedies; and &s;ince that period,
had invariably prohibited his family from ta&s;ting the &s;pring
waters, unle&s;s they were di&s;tilled, or mixed with wine or
vinegar; by which means he was able to pre&s;erve them
from tho&s;e tumours in the throat, that were extremely com|mon
among the natives of the town which he inhabited.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it is by no means my intention to trouble you
with the various opinions which have been advanced on this
&s;ubject; yet it would be unju&s;t to withhold from you that of
M. de Sau&s;&s;ure, who&s;e accurate re&s;earches and profound in|ve&s;tigation
on philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects, de&s;erve to be weighed
with the greate&s;t attention. That able naturali&s;t, in a recent
<PB N="328" REF="352">
publication<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Voyages dans les Alpes, ch. 48. vol. ii. p. 480.</NOTE>, attributes the production of goiters not to the
waters, but principally to the concentrated heat of the cli|mate,
and &s;tagnation of the air. He informs us, that in all
his travels through the Alpine countries, he never ob&s;erved
goiters in any places, which are elevated more than 500 or
600 toi&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">3200 and 3840 Engli&s;h feet.</NOTE> above the level of the &s;ea: he noticed them in
tho&s;e vallies where the heat is concentrated, and the air &s;tag|nates;
and that they u&s;ually cea&s;e wherever the valley termi|nates,
and the country expands into a large plain. With
great deference, however, to his opinion, may I be permitted
to ob&s;erve, that the conclu&s;ion does not ab&s;olutely follow
from the&s;e premi&s;es? For it may be remarked, that in places
elevated more than 500 or 600 toi&s;es above the level of the
&s;ea, the &s;prings are too near their &s;ources, to have di&s;&s;olved a
&s;ufficient quantity of calcareous matter, or &s;o minutely as
may be requi&s;ite for the generation of goiters; and that
when the valley expands into a plain, the waters may depo&s;it
their &s;ediment by mixing with the rivers and lakes, or by
filtrating through the earth and gravel. But although the
two cau&s;es mentioned by M. de Sau&s;&s;ure do not produce,
they may <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> in producing guttural excre&s;cences, by relax|ing
the fibres, and di&s;po&s;ing the glands of the throat to admit
more ea&s;ily the introduction of the impalpable parts which are
di&s;&s;olved in the water. For it is ob&s;ervable, that women and
children, who&s;e frames are more relaxed than tho&s;e of men,
are mo&s;t liable to be afflicted with the&s;e &s;wellings; and that
the natives of tho&s;e di&s;tricts mo&s;t remarkable for the &s;ize and
<PB N="329" REF="353">
number of goiters, are extremely wan and livid, much &s;ub|ject
to intermitting fevers, and other di&s;orders which are
judged to proceed from relaxation. In fine, although the
concentrated heat, and &s;tagnation of the air, may be allowed
to affect the human body to a con&s;iderable degree; yet they
do not of them&s;elves &s;eem &s;ufficient for the effect in que&s;tion,
without the intervention of &s;ome more powerful agent:
and this agent <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be the water; if the facts already
&s;tated, prove con&s;onant to truth and experience.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to obviate an objection
which maintains, that goiters mu&s;t rather originate from
climate and &s;ituation; becau&s;e foreigners e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
country, are <HI>never</HI> afflicted with tho&s;e tumours, while their
children are no le&s;s &s;ubject to them than the natives. But is
it an uncontrovertible fact, that <HI>no</HI> foreigner has ever been
afflicted with this malady? The que&s;tion, I &s;hould pre&s;ume,
can &s;carcely be replied to in the affirmative. And all that
can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, with any degree of certainty, is, that
foreigners are <HI>le&s;s</HI> &s;ubject to the&s;e &s;wellings than their chil|dren
or the natives. In this re&s;pect the an&s;wer is evident.
Per&s;ons who u&s;ually &s;ettle in foreign countries are adults;
and adults are doubtle&s;s much le&s;s liable than children to an
endemial malady, who&s;e operation is gradual, and which
requires much length of time, before its effects are in the
lea&s;t vi&s;ible. And it is remarked, that, among the natives
them&s;elves, tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have e&s;caped this di&s;order
during their infancy, are &s;eldom attacked by it to any con|&s;iderable
degree at a more advanced age.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="354">
IN rea&s;oning upon this, as well as on &s;imilar &s;ubjects,
where a cau&s;e is &s;ought for, capable of producing a certain
effect; it is nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a primary and general
cau&s;e, which <HI>always</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> exi&s;ts, wherever that
effect is produced; and to exclude tho&s;e circum&s;tances,
which do not <HI>always</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> exi&s;t, wherever that
effect is produced. Thus, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance: If &s;now-water
occa&s;ions goiters, wherever there are goiters, there
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;now-water; which is contrary to fact and ex|perience.
If the concentrated heat of the climate, and &s;tag|nation
of the air, are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the formation of goiters,
tho&s;e excre&s;cences could never be formed where the&s;e cau&s;es
are wanting; which is not confirmed by fact and experience.
If waters, impregnated with <HI>tuf,</HI> or with certain calcareous
&s;ub&s;tances, produce goiters; wherever there are goiters, the
natives mu&s;t drink waters &s;o impregnated; and this <HI>&s;eems</HI>
agreeable to fact and experience.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame cau&s;es, which generate goiters, <HI>probably</HI>
operate in the ca&s;e of idiots: for, wherever the goiters pre|vail
to a con&s;iderable degree, idiots al&s;o invariably abound.
As &s;uch is the nice and inexplicable connexion between our
bodies and our minds, that the one almo&s;t invariably &s;ym|pathi&s;es
with the other; it is by no means an ill-grounded
conjecture, that the &s;ame cau&s;es which affect the body
&s;hould al&s;o affect the mind; or, in other words, that the
&s;ame waters, which create ob&s;tructions and goiters, &s;hould
al&s;o occa&s;ion mental imbecility and di&s;arrangement.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="355">
ALTHOUGH the&s;e idiots are frequently the children of
goitrous parents, and have u&s;ually tho&s;e &s;wellings them|&s;elves;
yet they are &s;ometimes the offspring even of healthy
parents, who&s;e other children are properly organized, and
are them&s;elves free from guttural excre&s;cences. I ob&s;erved
&s;everal children, &s;carcely ten years of age, who had very
large goiters. The&s;e tumours, when they increa&s;e to a con|&s;iderable
magnitude, check re&s;piration, and render tho&s;e
who are afflicted with them exceedingly indolent and lan|guid.
Some per&s;ons have, in oppo&s;ition to the opinion which
I have ventured to advance, &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;mall guttural
&s;wellings, which are common in many other parts, and the
large excre&s;cences, which are more particularly ob&s;erved in
the Vallais, in the Valley of Ao&s;t, and in &s;ome other places,
do not proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and are not the &s;ame
di&s;order. But &s;ufficient rea&s;ons have not been a&s;&s;igned for
this opinion. During my expedition through the Vallais and
other parts of Switzerland, I noticed &s;ome of all proportions,
from the &s;ize of a walnut to almo&s;t the bigne&s;s of a peck
loaf. As the &s;ame gradation may be al&s;o ob&s;erved in the
&s;pecies of idiots; by a &s;imilar mode of argument, tho&s;e who
po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome faint dawnings of rea&s;on might be di&s;criminated
from others, who are totally deaf and dumb, and give no
proof of exi&s;tence but the more animal &s;en&s;ations. Whereas
it is probable, that in both in&s;tances, the greater or le&s;&s;er
di&s;arrangement of the body or mind does not indicate a
difference of complaint, but only greater or le&s;&s;er degrees of
the &s;ame complaint.</P>
<P>IT is to be pre&s;umed, that a people accu&s;tomed to the
&s;ight of the&s;e excre&s;cences, will not be &s;hocked at their de|formity;
<PB N="332" REF="356">
but I do not find, as &s;ome writers a&s;&s;ert, that they
con&s;ider them as beauties. To judge from the accounts of
many travellers, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the natives,
without exception, were either idiots or goitrous: whereas,
in fact, the Vallai&s;ans, in general, are a robu&s;t race; and all
that with truth can be affirmed, is, that goitrous per&s;ons,
and idiots, are more abundant in &s;ome di&s;tricts of the Vallais;
than perhaps in any other part of the globe.</P>
<P>IT has been a&s;&s;erted al&s;o, that the people very much
re&s;pect the&s;e idiots, and even con&s;ider them <HI>as ble&s;&s;ings from
Heaven;</HI> which is &s;trongly contradicted by others. Upon
my que&s;tioning &s;ome gentlemen of this country, at the
baths of Leuk, they treated the notion as ab&s;urd and fal&s;e:
but whether they delivered their real &s;entiments, or were
unwilling to confirm what might lower their countrymen in
the opinion of a &s;tranger, will admit perhaps of &s;ome doubt.
For having, &s;ince that time, repeatedly inquired among the
lower ranks, I am convinced, that the common people e&s;teem
them as ble&s;&s;ings. They call them &startq;<HI>Souls of God, without
&s;in:</HI>&endq; and many parents, from &s;uper&s;tition, prefer the&s;e idiot-children
to tho&s;e who&s;e under&s;tandings are perfect; becau&s;e,
as they are incapable of intentional criminality, they con&s;ider
them as certain of happine&s;s in a future &s;tate. Nor is this
opinion entirely without its good effect; as it di&s;po&s;es the
parents to pay greater attention to &s;uch helple&s;s beings.
The&s;e idiots are &s;uffered to marry, as well among them|&s;elves
as with others.</P>

<P>UPON quitting Trient, we traver&s;ed &s;ome narrow val|lies,
through fore&s;ts of pines, by the &s;ide of a &s;mall
but impetuous torrent, which takes its ri&s;e from the glacier
of the &s;ame name. The road, which is very rugged, is car|ried
over the &s;teep crags of a mountain called <HI>La Tete Noire.</HI>
A little way from Trient we entered the duchy of Faucigny,
&s;ubject to the king of Sardinia. Our road was very rough,
till we arrived at the vale of Chamouny; the great moun|tains
and glaciers of Savoy ri&s;ing maje&s;tically before us.</P>
<P>ANOTHER way leads from Trient to Chamouny over the
<HI>Col de Balme.</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed it on a mule the 7th of September
1785; it is exceedingly &s;teep, but not dangerous, for I did
not even find it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mount. The path, which is
in no part bare rock, runs through a thick wood that clothes
the &s;ides of the mountain. We &s;et off from Trient on this
expedition about half pa&s;t four, with the expectation of &s;ee|ing
the &s;un ri&s;e of the &s;ummit of Mont Blanc, but were di&s;|appointed;
for we did not reach the Col de Balme in le&s;s
than two hours, and day had already begun to break. We
enjoyed, however, from the &s;ummit an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect,
which many travellers con&s;ider as the mo&s;t &s;ublime view in
all Switzerland: on one &s;ide it commands the Vallais, the
<PB N="334" REF="359">
alps of St. Bernard, and the di&s;tant mountains of the cantons
of Underwalden and Berne; the other comprehends Mont
Blanc and the circumjacent heights. I ob&s;erved the <HI>Point de

<P>MONT BLANC is particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed from other
mountains, by having its &s;ummit and &s;ides clothed to a con|&s;iderable
depth with a mantle of &s;now, almo&s;t without the
intervention of the lea&s;t rock to break the glare of the <HI>while</HI>
appearance; from whence its name is derived. This cir|cum&s;tance
frequently deceives the eye unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch
objects, and in many &s;ituations renders it le&s;s lofty in appear|ance,
than it is in reality. Although its &s;ummit was elevated
<PB N="335" REF="360">
more than &s;even thou&s;and feet above the &s;pot where I &s;tood,
yet it did not impre&s;s me with that a&s;toni&s;hment which
might be expected from its &s;uperior height and magnitude
above the circumjacent mountains. I was indeed more
&s;truck with the fir&s;t view of the Schreckhorn from the top
of the Scheidec, than of Mont Blanc from the Col de Balme.
The &s;ummit of Mont Blanc being of a roundi&s;h form, and
covered with &s;now, unites beauty with grandeur; whereas
the Schreckhorn being piked, naked, and its &s;hagged &s;ides
only &s;treaked with &s;now, its grand characteri&s;tics are rug|gedne&s;s
and horror; and hence, indeed, it derives its name
of Schreckhorn, or the <HI>Peak of Terror</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The traveller will recollect, that I am here de&s;cribing Mont Blanc, as ob|&s;erved from the Col de Balme, and the vale of Chamouny.

But Mont Blanc
&s;oon re-a&s;&s;umed its real importance, &s;eemed to increa&s;e in
&s;ize and height, and &s;olely attracted our attention, until we
entered the vale of Chamouny.</P>
<P>YOU, who are totally unacquainted with alpine &s;cenes,
may, perhaps, conceive a faint idea of the elevation of this
gigantic mountain, on being informed, that the mantle of
&s;now, which appears to cover its top and &s;ides, exceeds an
altitude of four thou&s;and feet perpendicular, and nine thou|&s;and
feet in a horizontal direction from the <HI>Dome of Gout&eacute;</HI>
to the &s;ummit; and that the height of the &s;now and ice, e&s;ti|mated
from the &s;ource of the Arveron, at the bottom of the
glacier of Montanvert, to the &s;ummit of Mont Blanc, cannot
be le&s;s than twelve thou&s;and perpendicular feet, or near
three times as high as Snowdon, in North Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="361">
FIVE glaciers extend into this vale of Chamouny, and are
&s;eparated from each other by fore&s;ts, corn-fields, and mea|dows;
&s;o that large tracts of ice are blended with cultivation,
and perpetually &s;ucceed each other in the mo&s;t &s;ingular and
&s;triking vici&s;&s;itude. The&s;e glaciers, which lie chiefly in the
hollows of the mountains, and are &s;ome leagues in length,
unite at the foot of <HI>Mont Blanc;</HI> the highe&s;t mountain in
Europe, and probably of the antient world.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the calculations of Mr. de Luc, (by who&s;e
improvement of the barometer, elevations are taken with a
degree of accuracy before unattainable), the height of this
mountain above the level of the &s;ea is 2,391 &frac13; French toi&s;es,
or 15,304 Engli&s;h feet<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In reducing the French toi&s;e, which is equal to &s;ix French feet, to Engli&s;h mea&s;ure, I have con&s;idered the proportion of the Engli&s;h to the French foot as 15 to 16. Its real proportion, according to the accurate calculation of Sir George Schuck|borough, is $word$, or 15 to 16 and a &s;mall fraction: but the error in my calculation being not one toi&s;e in a thou&s;and, in order to prevent confu&s;ion, I have omitted the &s;mall fraction.</NOTE>; or, according to Sir George
Schuckborough, of 15,662 feet; which gives a difference of
only 358 feet. Mr. de Luc having found the altitude of the
<HI>Buet,</HI> from thence took geometrically the elevation of <HI>Mont
Blanc.</HI> The labours of this celebrated naturali&s;t, and his
rules for computing heights by the barometer, are to be
found in his very valuable treati&s;e, &startq;<HI>Sur les Modifications de
l'Atmo&s;ph&egrave;re.</HI>&endq; The&s;e rules are explained, and his tables
reduced to Engli&s;h mea&s;ure, by Dr. Ma&s;kelyne, R. A.; and
&s;till more fully by Dr. Hor&s;ley: both the&s;e treati&s;es are
publi&s;hed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year
1774.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="362">
THE accuracy of the barometrical mea&s;urements made
by Mr. de Luc, was verified by Sir George Schuckborough,
in a number of ingenious experiments towards a&s;certaining
the elevation of &s;everal mountains of Savoy, a &s;hort time be|fore
I arrived at Geneva. He followed Mr. de Luc's method;
computed the heights of &s;everal mountains, reciprocally, by
barometrical and geometrical ob&s;ervations; and perceived
that the former coincided almo&s;t exactly with the latter.
Having found the elevation of the &s;ummit of the <HI>Mole</HI> above
the &s;urface of the lake of Geneva, he took from thence the
geometrical altitude of <HI>Mont Blanc.</HI> During the cour&s;e of
the&s;e experiments, he was enabled to correct &s;ome trifling
errors that had crept into Mr. de Luc's calculations; to im|prove
&s;till further the di&s;coveries of the latter; and has faci|litated
the means of taking elevations, by &s;implifying the
tables and rules nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I AM convinced, from the &s;ituation of <HI>Mont Blanc,</HI> and
from its &s;uperior altitude above the &s;urrounding mountains,
that it exceeds the loftie&s;t point in Switzerland, which,
beyond a doubt, is, next to <HI>Mont Blanc,</HI> the mo&s;t elevated
ground in Europe. That it is higher than any part of A&s;ia
and Africa, is an a&s;&s;ertion which can only be proved by com|paring
the judicious calculations of modern travellers, with
the exaggerated accounts of former writers; and by &s;hewing,
that there is probably no mountain in tho&s;e two quarters of
the globe, the altitude whereof, when accurately taken, &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es
15,000 feet.</P>
<P>PERHAPS in no in&s;tance has the imagination of man
been more given to amplification, than in a&s;certaining the
<PB N="338" REF="363">
heights of the globe. Gruner, in his de&s;cription of the
Swi&s;s glaciers, has mentioned the elevation of &s;ome remark|able
mountains, agreeably to the calculations of &s;everal
famous geographers and travellers, both antient and modern:</P>

If we con&s;ult more modern and rational accounts; it appears,
that the Peak of Teneriff and Aetna have been frequently

is e&s;timated by &s;ome natural philo&s;ophers, to be 3,000 toi&s;es,

Mont Blanc, the Schreckhorn, the Peak of Teneriff,
the mountains of the Moon in Africa, the Taurus, and the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GLACIER OF BOSSON&mdash;MONTANVERT&mdash;EXPEDITION
ACROSS THE VALLEY OF ICE.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUST 23d, we mounted by the &s;ide of the glacier
of Bo&s;&s;on, to <HI>les Murailles de glace,</HI> &s;o called from their
re&s;emblance to walls: they form large ranges of ice of pro|digious
thickne&s;s and &s;olidity, ri&s;ing abruptly from their
ba&s;e, and parallel to each other<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In 1785, the&s;e <HI>murailles de glace</HI> no longer exi&s;ted.</NOTE>. Some of the&s;e ranges ap|peared
to us about a hundred and fifty feet high; but, if
we may believe our guides, they are four hundred feet above
their real ba&s;e. Near them were pyramids and cones of ice
of all forms and &s;izes, &s;hooting to a very con&s;iderable height,
in the mo&s;t beautiful and fanta&s;tic &s;hapes. From this
glacier, which we cro&s;&s;ed without much difficulty, we en|joyed
a fine view of the vale of Chamouny.</P>
<P>THE 24th. We had propo&s;ed &s;allying forth this morning
very early, in order to vi&s;it the valley of ice, in the glacier
of Montanvert, and to penetrate as far as the time would
admit; but the weather proving cloudy, and likely to rain,
we deferred our departure till nine. Having procured three
guides, we a&s;cended on hor&s;eback about three miles: we
<PB N="341" REF="367">
were then obliged to di&s;mount, and &s;crambled up a &s;teep and
rugged path, called &startq;the road of the <HI>cry&s;tal-hunters.</HI>&endq;
From the &s;ummit of the Montanvert we de&s;cended to the
edge of the glacier; and made a refre&s;hing meal upon &s;ome
cold provi&s;ion which we brought with us. A large block
of granite, called &startq;<HI>La pierre des Anglois,</HI>&endq; &s;erved us for a
table; and near us was a hovel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Since my fir&s;t expedition, Mr. Blair, an Engli&s;h gentleman, has built a more com|modious wooden hut, which, from him, is called Blair's Cabin.</NOTE>, where tho&s;e, who make
expeditions towards Mont Blanc, frequently pa&s;s the night.
The &s;cene around us was magnificent and &s;ublime; num|berle&s;s
rocks ri&s;ing boldly above the clouds, &s;ome of who&s;e
tops were bare, others covered with &s;now. Many of the&s;e
peaks gradually dimini&s;hing towards their &s;ummits, end in
&s;harp points, and are called <HI>Needles.</HI> Between the&s;e rocks,
the valley of ice &s;tretches &s;everal leagues in length, and is
nearly a mile broad; extending on one &s;ide towards Mont
Blanc, and, on the other, towards the plain of Chamouny.
The names of the principal needles are, Aiguilles de Midi,
de Dru, de Bouchard, de Moine, de Tacul, de Charmeaux;
and the five glaciers, that &s;tretch towards the plain of Cha|mouny,
and unite at the foot of Mont Blanc, are called
Tacona, Bo&s;&s;ons, Montanvert, Argentiere, and Tour.</P>
<P>AFTER we had &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we pre|pared
for our adventure acro&s;s the ice. We had each of us a
long pole &s;piked with iron; and, in order to &s;ecure us as
much as po&s;&s;ible from &s;lipping, the guides fa&s;tened to our
&s;hoes <HI>crampons,</HI> or &s;mall bars of iron, provided with four
&s;mall &s;pikes. The difficulty of cro&s;&s;ing the&s;e valleys of ice,
<PB N="342" REF="368">
ari&s;es from the immen&s;e cha&s;ms. We rolled down large
&s;tones into &s;everal of them; and the great length of time be|fore
they reached the bottom, gave us &s;ome conception of
their depth: our guides a&s;&s;ured us, that in &s;ome places they
are not le&s;s than five hundred feet deep. I can no otherwi&s;e
convey to you an image of this body of ice, broken into ir|regular
ridges and deep cha&s;ms, than by comparing it to
waves in&s;tantaneou&s;ly frozen in the mid&s;t of a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P>WE began our walk with great &s;lowne&s;s and deliberation,
but gradually gaining courage and confidence as we ad|vanced,
we &s;oon found that we could &s;afely pa&s;s along tho&s;e
places, where the a&s;cent and de&s;cent were not very con&s;ider|able,
much fa&s;ter even than when walking at the rate of our
common pace: in other parts we leaped over the clefts, and &s;lid
down the &s;teeper de&s;cents. In one place, where we de&s;cend|ed
and &s;tepped acro&s;s an opening upon a narrow ridge of ice
&s;carcely three inches broad, we were obliged to tread with
peculiar caution: for on each &s;ide were cha&s;ms of a great
depth. We walked &s;ome paces &s;ideways along this ridge;
&s;tept acro&s;s the cha&s;m into a little hollow, which the guides
contrived on purpo&s;e for our feet; and got up an a&s;cent by
means of &s;mall holes which we made with the &s;pikes of our
poles. This account appears terrible; but at the time we
had not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions of danger, as the guides
were exceedingly careful, and took excellent precautions.
One of our &s;ervants had the courage to follow us without
<HI>crampons,</HI> and with no nails to his &s;hoes; which was cer|tainly
dangerous, on account of the &s;lipperine&s;s of the lea|ther
when wetted.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="369">
WE had now almo&s;t reached the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, when
being &s;topped by a broad cha&s;m, we were obliged to make a
circuit of above a quarter of a mile, in order to get round it.
This will give you &s;ome idea of the difficulty attending ex|cur&s;ions
over &s;ome of the&s;e glaciers: and our guides inform|ed
us, that when they hunt the chamois and the marmots,
the&s;e unavoidable circuits generally carry them &s;ix or &s;even
miles, when the direct di&s;tance is only two miles, if they
could proceed in a &s;trait line. A &s;torm threatening every
moment, we were obliged to ha&s;ten off the glacier as fa&s;t as
po&s;&s;ible: for rain renders the ice exceedingly &s;lippery; and
in ca&s;e of a fog, which generally accompanies a &s;torm in
the&s;e upper regions, our &s;ituation would have been extreme|ly
dangerous. And indeed we had no time to lo&s;e; for we
had &s;carcely quitted the ice before the tempe&s;t began, and
&s;oon became very violent, attended with frequent fla&s;hes of
lightning, and loud peals of thunder, which being re-echoed
within the hollows of the mountains, added greatly to the
awful &s;ublimity of the &s;cene. We crawled for a con&s;ider|able
way upon our hands and feet along a &s;teep and bare
rock, and down one of the mo&s;t difficult and rugged preci|pices
I ever de&s;cended in Switzerland; the thunder at the
&s;ame time roaring over us, and rendering the rock ex|tremely
&s;lippery. After much difficulty, but without the
lea&s;t accident, we gained the valley of Chamouny, and re|turned
to the inn, as wet as if we had been plunged into
water; but perfectly &s;atisfied with our expedition.</P>

<P>IN my &s;econd expedition to the valley of Chamouny,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXCURSION TOWARDS THE SUMMIT OF THE
COUVERCLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my &s;ub&s;equent expedition to the valley of Chamouny,
I had propo&s;ed pu&s;hing my cour&s;e &s;till further towards
the glacier of Talefre, but particularly to the Couvercle, of
which I had read a very curious de&s;cription in Mr. de Sau&s;|&s;ure's
work. But having hurt my foot in a&s;cending the
Montanvert, I was prevented from executing my intended
purpo&s;e. You will, however, have no rea&s;on to regret my
di&s;appointment, on receiving the following account of that
expedition, extracted from notes communicated by a friend.</P>
<P>WE quitted the Priory at &s;ix in the morning, accom|panied
by Michael Paccard and Marie Coutet, two guides of
Chamouny, traver&s;ed the plain, and a&s;cended the Montan|vert
through a wood of pines. We had fine views of the
glacier which gives ri&s;e to the Arveron, and of the vale of
Chamouny, chequered in a mo&s;t &s;ingular manner with alter|nate
rows of arable and pa&s;ture land. After continuing
about an hour, we quitted our mules, proceeded on foot, and
in about an hour and a half reached Blair's Hut, on the top
of the Montanvert, where we re&s;ted for a few minutes. We
then de&s;cended to the glacier, coa&s;ted it by the path of the
chry&s;tal hunters, and in about half an hour came to &s;ome
difficult pa&s;&s;es called <HI>Les Ponts,</HI> or the Bridges, which run
<PB N="347" REF="373">
over a perpendicular rock, at the edge of a frightful preci|pice.
The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, though &s;till difficult, were extremely
dangerous, until, by order of M. de Sau&s;&s;ure, the rock was in
&s;ome parts blown away with gunpowder, and &s;mall holes
formed for the hands and feet. The fir&s;t bridge was about
forty paces in length, and the two other pa&s;&s;es &s;omewhat le&s;s
difficult, of about ten paces each. In about a quarter of an
hour we arrived at a fountain which drops from the roof
and &s;ides of a natural grotto, the in&s;ide whereof is over|grown
with large tufts of the <HI>Ranunculus glacialis.</HI> Having
walked about eight miles &s;ince our departure from Chamou|ny,
we &s;at down in this &s;eque&s;tered grotto, and made our
fir&s;t repa&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM hence we cro&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;now, the remains of a la&s;t
winter's <HI>Avalanche,</HI> and immediately got upon the <HI>Moraine,</HI>
the term given to the &s;tones and earth which the glaciers
di&s;gorge on each &s;ide, after having received them from the
&s;uperimpending mountains: they are very treacherous and
difficult to walk upon. The ice upon which the&s;e &s;tones
re&s;t is harder than that of the re&s;t of the glacier; and the
earth is laid in &s;uch regular and equable heaps, as to give the
appearance of art. As we looked from hence over the valley
of ice, a pa&s;&s;age &s;eemed impracticable; &s;o numerous and
broad were the cha&s;ms which inter&s;ected it in every direc|tion,
many bearing a tremendous appearance, and of an
a&s;toni&s;hing depth: but we &s;oon found that it only required
courage and activity. In&s;tead of <HI>crampons,</HI> we had large
nails in our &s;hoes, which more effectually an&s;wered our pur|po&s;e,
and our &s;piked &s;ticks were particularly &s;erviceable.
<PB N="348" REF="374">
Having de&s;cended upon the glacier, we found the ice &s;often|ed
by a warm wind, which rendered it le&s;s &s;lippery than
u&s;ual. We continued along it about a quarter of an hour,
then regained and walked along the Moraine near half an
hour. We now embarked upon the great valley of ice called
<HI>Glacier des Bois,</HI> I own not without emotion to &s;ee our|&s;elves
upon this extraordinary de&s;ert, broken into frightful
cha&s;ms, through the maze of which we were to pa&s;s. It
was curious to ob&s;erve the numerous little rills produced by
the collection of drops occa&s;ioned by the thawing of the ice
on the upper part of the glacier: the&s;e little rills hollow out
&s;mall channels, and torrent-like precipitate them&s;elves into
the cha&s;ms with a violent noi&s;e; increa&s;ing the body of
waters formed by the melting of the interior &s;urface, and
finding an outlet under the immen&s;e arch of ice in the val|ley
of Chamouny, from which the Arveron ru&s;hes. This
ice-water was agreeable to the palate, and extremely refre&s;h|ing
from its coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE field of ice, which at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eemed impervious
to all but the chamois and marmot, and &s;carcely practicable
even for the daring foot&s;teps of man, is traver&s;ed by flocks
of &s;heep, driven to the &s;canty pa&s;turage which the oppo&s;ite
rocks afford. The &s;hepherds leave them in the&s;e de&s;olate
&s;pots, and vi&s;it them at different intervals. We traced their
track over the ice, and &s;aw a flock returning. One &s;hepherd
preceded as a guide, and another followed the herd. We
had the good fortune to pre&s;erve one &s;heep which had
&s;trayed from the flock.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="375">
As we were continuing our cour&s;e, we were &s;urprized
by a loud noi&s;e; and, looking round, perceived a large frag|ment
of rock which had detached it&s;elf from one of the
highe&s;t needles: it bounded from precipice to precipice with
great rapidity, and, before it reached the bottom, was
pounded almo&s;t entirely into du&s;t. Having proceeded about
an hour, we were a&s;toni&s;hed with a view far more magnifi|cent
than imagination can conceive: hitherto the glaciers
had &s;carcely an&s;wered our expectations, but now they far
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed them. Nature had clad her&s;elf in all her terrors.
Before us was a valley of ice twenty miles in extent, bound|ed
by a circular glacier of pure unbroken &s;now, called Tacu,
which leads directly to the foot of Mont Blanc, and is &s;ur|rounded
by large conical rocks, terminating in &s;harp points
like the towers of an ancient fortification; to the right ro&s;e
a range of magnificent peaks, their intervals filled with gla|ciers;
and far above the re&s;t, the maje&s;tic &s;ummit of Mont
Blanc, his highe&s;t point ob&s;cured with clouds. He appear|ed
of &s;uch immen&s;e magnitude, that at his pre&s;ence the cir|cumjacent
mountains, however gigantic, &s;eemed to &s;hrink
before him, and &startq;<HI>hide their dimini&s;hed heads</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>.&endq; In half an
hour we arrived at the Moraine, which forms a boundary
of the valley, cro&s;&s;ed it, and proceeded upon a body of ice
about three quarters of a mile broad. Here the ice was
more even and free from cha&s;ms than in the great valley.
We then pa&s;&s;ed a &s;econd Moraine, and beyond that another
ma&s;s of ice to a third Moraine: de&s;cending from thence, we
came upon the la&s;t ridge of ice, broader con&s;iderably than
<PB N="350" REF="376">
the two former, and full of large cha&s;ms: it is &s;eparated
from the rock only by a very narrow Moraine. The&s;e Mo|raines
contain great quantities of chry&s;tal.</P>
<P>HERE we turned a little to the right, and a&s;cended the
valley of ice, the &s;cene every moment increa&s;ing in magnifi|cence
and horror. In a &s;hort time we arrived at the foot of
the Couvercle, having walked about &s;ix miles on the ice.
We now found it difficult to quit the ice; and the fir&s;t part
of the de&s;cent was really perilous. One &s;tep was truly
dreadful: a bulging rock entirely &s;mooth, and pre&s;enting a
precipice of very con&s;iderable depth, which was terminated
by an immen&s;e cha&s;m in the ice, &s;eemed to forbid our pro|gre&s;s;
a &s;mall hollow, however, in the middle &s;erved for one
foot, and from thence we bounded over to the firm ground.
One guide went fir&s;t, and held out his hand on the oppo&s;ite
&s;ide, whil&s;t the other helped and directed us where to place
our feet. We continued a&s;cending a path which now &s;eem|ed
without danger, though very narrow and &s;teep, and car|ried
along the ridge of precipices. The &s;cenery around was
indeed &s;o &s;ublime as to bani&s;h all ideas of fatigue and appre|hen&s;ion.
Half an hour more brought us to the &s;ide of a
fountain, where we &s;at down to our dinner. We had now
employed five hours and a half from Chamouny, and not|with&s;tanding
all difficulties and nece&s;&s;ary halts, had walked
fifteen miles, but none of us complained of fatigue.</P>
<P>THE clouds beginning to gather, warned us to ha&s;ten to
the top of the Couvercle. From that &s;tation we had the
view of three &s;tupendous vallies of ice, the glacier of Talefre
<PB N="351" REF="377">
to the left, in front that of l'Echaut, and the Tacu to the
right; all uniting in one great valley of ice called the <HI>Glacier
des Bois,</HI> which &s;tretched under our feet, and was &s;urround|ed
and ornamented by the rugged needles. The dead
&s;ilence, which reigned in this place, was only interrupted by
the bounding of di&s;tant chamois, and the cries of alarm
which the marmots gave to their tribes at our approach.</P>
<P>HAVING refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we proceeded to the top of
the Couvercle, a mo&s;t extraordinary rock, having the ap|pearance
of a large irregular multilateral building placed on
a mountain. The rock is granite, the a&s;cent was laborious,
but perfectly &s;ecure. Towards its foot we found a bottle
containing the names of two Engli&s;hmen who had reached
that place about a fortnight before, and probably flattered
them&s;elves that no &s;tranger would go beyond them. We
wrote our names on the rever&s;e of the paper, and carried the
bottle with us to the &s;ummit of the Couvercle. Three quar|ters
of an hour brought us to the point, and we reached a rock
overhanging a precipice which my eyes dared not mea&s;ure.
In this &s;ituation we were &s;urprized with a thunder-&s;torm,
which added great horror and magnificence to the &s;cene.
We took &s;helter under an impending rock, and li&s;tened to
the roaring of the &s;torm with a mixed &s;en&s;ation of fear and
plea&s;ure. On reflecting in this place that we were to mea|&s;ure
back the &s;ame ground, and to undergo a repetition of
the &s;ame difficulties, we were not exempted from alarm: but
recollecting, that it is the duty of man to encounter &s;ome
dangers, in order to behold &s;uch glorious &s;cenes, we from
that moment bani&s;hed all apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="378">
OUR view from the top of the Couvercle comprehended
the &s;ame &s;ublime &s;cenes we had enjoyed from its ba&s;e, but
con&s;iderably heightened and enlarged; and the &s;tupendous
extent of ice appeared like a rugged expan&s;e of frozen &s;ea,
bounded by the mo&s;t gigantic rocks, and terminated by
Mont Blanc, the Atlas of the globe. Although we were thus
entirely enclo&s;ed between ice and &s;now, and barren crags,
where all vegetation might be &s;uppo&s;ed to cea&s;e; yet our
eyes repo&s;ed on a triangular rock, clothed with gra&s;s and
alpine plants, and &s;tarting up like a fertile i&s;land in the mid&s;t
of a de&s;olate ocean. It is known by the name of the <HI>Garden,</HI>
and exhibits a curious contra&s;t to the &s;urrounding drearine&s;s.
During our expeditions into the Alps, we had frequently
found occa&s;ion to remark the peculiarly deep &s;hade of the
blue colour in the &startq;<HI>pure Empyreal</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>;&endq; and to-day we were
more particulaaly affected with this circum&s;tance. It con|veyed
a mo&s;t &s;ublime idea of the infinity of &s;pace: the higher
we a&s;cended, the more beautiful it &s;eemed; and we were
informed by a per&s;on accu&s;tomed to alpine &s;cenes, that on
con&s;iderable elevations he had frequently ob&s;erved the &s;tars
at noon-day.</P>
<P>OUR de&s;cent from the&s;e icy regions was no le&s;s fortunate
than our a&s;cent; we reached the Priory at &s;even in the after|noon,
without the lea&s;t accident, and wrapt in a&s;toni&s;hment
on the recollection of &s;cenes, which &s;urpa&s;s the imagination,
as much as they defy de&s;cription.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO REACH THE SUMMIT OF
MONT BLANC&mdash;SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION OF
JAMES BALMA AND DR. PACCARD&mdash;OF MON|SIEUR
DE SAUSSURE&mdash;HIS PHYSICAL OBSER|VATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS attempts having been made to reach the
&s;ummit of Mont Blanc, as well by the guides of Cha|mouny,
as by Me&s;&s;ieurs de Sau&s;&s;ure and Bourrit; a chrono|logical
account of the principal expeditions, which have at
length terminated &s;ucce&s;sfully, will not, perhaps, be un|intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t enterprize was formed by Mr. Couteran and
three guides of Chamouny, Michael Paccard, Victor Ti&s;&s;ay,
and Marie Coutet. On the thirteenth of July 1776, the&s;e
adventurers &s;et off from the Priory about eleven in the even|ing.
They pa&s;&s;ed between the glaciers of Bo&s;&s;on and Ta|cona;
and after having employed above fourteen hours in
mounting rugged and dangerous a&s;cents, in cro&s;&s;ing &s;everal
vallies of ice, and large plains of &s;now, they found them|&s;elves
upon the top next to Mont Blanc. At fir&s;t &s;ight, that
mountain appeared &s;carcely a league di&s;tant; but they &s;oon
di&s;covered that the clearne&s;s of the air, the extraordinary
whitene&s;s of the &s;now, and its great height, made it &s;eem
nearer than it was in reality: and they perceived with re|gret,
<PB N="354" REF="380">
that it would require at lea&s;t four hours more to reach
the &s;ummit, even &s;uppo&s;ing it practicable. But as the day
was far advanced, and the vapours towards the &s;ummit of
Mont Blanc began to gather into clouds, they were obliged
to relinqui&s;h their enterprize. As they were returning
in great ha&s;te, one of the party &s;lipped in attempting to leap
over a cha&s;m of ice. He held in his hand a long pole, &s;piked
with iron, which he had &s;truck into the ice; and upon this
he hung dreadfully &s;u&s;pended for a few moments, until he
was relea&s;ed by his companions. The danger he had ju&s;t
e&s;caped, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that he fainted
away, and continued for &s;ome time in that &s;ituation: he was
at length brought to him&s;elf, and, though con&s;iderably
brui&s;ed, &s;ufficiently recovered to be able to continue his
journey. They arrived at Chamouny about eight that
evening, after having employed two-and-twenty hours: as
&s;ome &s;ort of recompence for &s;o much fatigue, they enjoyed
the &s;atisfaction, at lea&s;t, of having approached nearer to
Mont Blanc than any former adventurers.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Sir George Schuckborough, the &s;ummit to
which they arrived is more than 13,000 feet above the Medi|terranean.
The&s;e per&s;ons, however, did not take the nece&s;|&s;ary
precautions for &s;o perilous an enterprize: for the expe|dition
was not only extremely hazardous, but was al&s;o far
too fatiguing and difficult to be accompli&s;hed within twenty-four
hours. They ought to have &s;et out in the morning,
and to have found &s;ome proper place in which they might
pa&s;s the night, they would then have been &s;ufficiently re|fre&s;hed
the next morning to pur&s;ue their expedition; and
<PB N="355" REF="381">
would not have found them&s;elves, after advancing within four
hours of Mont Blanc, unable to proceed, and in danger of being
overtaken by darkne&s;s in &s;o dreary a &s;ituation. The failure
of this expedition &s;eemed for &s;ome time to repre&s;s all future
attempts to attain the top of Mont Blanc, until the indefati|gable
Mr. Bourrit infu&s;ed a new &s;pirit into the inhabitants
of Chamouny. After reiterated though un&s;ucce&s;sful at|tempts,
on the 11th of September 1784, Mr. Bourrit, accom|panied
by &s;ix guides, departed from Biona&s;ay; and was <HI>&s;ca|ling,</HI>
as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, the <HI>rampart</HI> of Mont Blanc,
when he &s;uddenly found him&s;elf &s;o extremely affected by
the inten&s;e cold, that he was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>MARIE COUTET and Francis Guidet, two of the guides
who attended him in this expedition, had preceded their
company, and a&s;cended to the Dome of Gout&egrave;, which is
about 9,400 feet in a &s;trait horizontal direction from the
&s;ummit. Marie Coutet informed me, that they pa&s;&s;ed the Mid|dle
Dome, and walked along the ridge between that dome and
the &s;ummit as far as &s;ome high rocks, which appear from
the vale of Chamouny like &s;mall points ri&s;ing out of the
&s;now; but night approaching, obliged them to return. On
the 4th of September 1785, Marie Coutet and James Lambat
reached a place under a rock at a con&s;iderable elevation,
where they pa&s;&s;ed the night. Setting off before &s;un-ri&s;e,
found them&s;elves about &s;even on the Dome of Gout&egrave;; and
were proceeding towards the &s;ummit, with a fair pro&s;pect of
&s;ucce&s;s, when a violent &s;torm of hail en&s;ued, accompanied
with &s;uch a &s;trong wind, as compelled them to return.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="382">
ON the 13th of September, Me&s;&s;ieurs de Sau&s;&s;ure and
Bourrit, attended by twelve guides well provided with baro|meters,
thermometers, and other in&s;truments, for the pur|po&s;e
of making the nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations, departed from
Biona&s;ay, and arrived at a hut, which they had ordered to be
con&s;tructed at <HI>Pierre Ronde</HI> 7,808 feet above the level of the
&s;ea. Here they pa&s;&s;ed the night, and early the next morn|ing
reached the Dome of Gout&egrave; without the lea&s;t accident,
and without much difficulty; where they were &s;topped by
a fre&s;h fall of &s;now, into which they &s;unk &s;o deep, that all
farther progre&s;s was impracticable. Mr. de Sau&s;&s;ure informs
us, that the mercury in the barometer &s;unk eighteen inches
and a half, and that he reached an elevation of 1,290 toi&s;es,
or 8,256 Engli&s;h feet.</P>
<P>AT length, in July 1786, &s;ix guides of Chamouny having
failed in another attempt, James Balma, one of the party, be|ing
overtaken by darkne&s;s, as he was rambling upon the ice,
mi&s;&s;ed his way, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in a &s;pot above the
Dome of Gout&egrave;, elevated more than 12,000 feet above the
level of the &s;ea. His youth, and the &s;trength of his con&s;ti|tution,
having pre&s;erved him from the effects of the noctur|nal
cold in &s;o &s;evere an atmo&s;phere, at the approach of morn
he reconnoitered the &s;ituation, and ob&s;erved a part which
appeared to him more ea&s;y of acce&s;s than any of the others
that had been hitherto attempted. On his arrival at Cha|mouny
he was &s;eized with a very &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition, the
effect of extreme fatigue, and of the inten&s;e cold. Being at|tended
by Doctor Paccard, a phy&s;ician of the place, James
Balma communicated his ob&s;ervations; and, in gratitude for
<PB N="357" REF="383">
his attendance, offered to conduct him to the &s;ummit of
Mont Blanc.</P>
<P>ON the 7th of Augu&s;t, the&s;e two daring adventurers &s;al|lied
from Chamouny upon this memorable expedition, and
reached before dark the mountain of <HI>La Cote,</HI> which over|hangs
the upper part of the glacier of Bo&s;&s;on. Here they
pa&s;&s;ed the night; and at three in the morning pur&s;ued their
route over the ice, a&s;cended the Dome of Gout&egrave;, pa&s;&s;ed under
the Middle Dome, and at the la&s;t pyramid of rock turned to
the ea&s;t, and continued along the ridge, which is &s;een from
Geneva, and lies on the left of the &s;ummit. Here they fir&s;t
began to experience &s;uch inten&s;e cold, and &s;uch extreme fa|tigue,
that Dr. Paccard was almo&s;t induced to relinqui&s;h the
enterprize: being, however, encouraged by James Balma,
more accu&s;tomed to &s;uch fatiguing and dangerous expedi|tions,
he followed his companion. The wind was &s;o violent
and piercing, that in order to avoid its blowing in their faces,
they were obliged to walk &s;ideways for a con&s;iderable time.
About &s;ix in the afternoon, they at length attained the &s;um|mit
of Mont Blanc; and &s;tood triumphantly on a &s;pot of
ground, which no one had reached before, and at the ele|vation
of 15,662 feet above the &s;ea, which is undoubtedly
the highe&s;t point in the antient globe. They remained on
the &s;ummit no more than half an hour, the cold being &s;o
inten&s;e, that the provi&s;ion was frozen in their pockets, the
ink congealed in their inkhorns; and the mercury in Fah|renheit's
thermometer &s;unk to 18 &frac12; degrees. Doctor Paccard
had ju&s;t time to ob&s;erve the &s;tate of the barometer, which he
has not communicated to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="384">
THEY had employed fifteen hours in a&s;cending; and
though they again reached the mountain of La Cote in five
hours, yet they found great difficulty in de&s;cending, their
&s;ight being debilitated by the reflection from the &s;now.
They arrrived at La Cote about midnight, after twenty
hours unremitted fatigue. Having repo&s;ed them&s;elves two
hours, they again &s;allied forth, and returned to Chamouny
at eight in the morning. Their faces were excoriated, and
their lips exceedingly &s;welled; Dr. Paccard was almo&s;t blind,
and his eyes continued to be affected for a con&s;iderable time.
We cannot expect any accurate experiments from the&s;e two
per&s;ons, to whom the glory of having fir&s;t a&s;cended the
&s;ummit of Mont Blanc is undoubtedly due. But they pre|pared
the way for the ob&s;ervations and di&s;coveries of fu|ture
naturali&s;ts, and particularly of M. de Sau&s;&s;ure, who&s;e
indefatigable zeal did not permit him to re&s;t, until he had
reached the top of Mont Blanc, and made tho&s;e experiments
which cannot fail greatly to elucidate the theory of the
atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>THAT able naturali&s;t &s;et out on this &s;ucce&s;sful expedition,
from the valley of Chamouny, on the 13th of Augu&s;t 1787.
He was accompanied by eighteen guides, who carried a tent,
matra&s;&s;es, all nece&s;&s;ary accommodations, and in&s;truments of
experimental philo&s;ophy. They pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t night on
the top of the mountain of La Cote, in a hut previou&s;ly
con&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e. At four o'clock in the follow|ing
afternoon they reached an elevation of 9,312 feet above
the Priory, or 12,762 above the level of the &s;ea. Here they
encamped, and formed an excavation in the congealed &s;now,
<PB N="359" REF="385">
which they covered with a tent. In this icy habitation,
in&s;tead of &s;uffering from the cold, M. de Sau&s;&s;ure felt &s;uch
a &s;uffocating heat, from the clo&s;ene&s;s of the tent, and the
number of per&s;ons crouded in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, that he
was frequently obliged to go into the open air in order to
breathe.</P>
<P>THE next morning the whole company departed at
&s;even; and found the a&s;cent in &s;ome places &s;o &s;teep, that the
guides who preceded were obliged to hew out &s;teps with a
hatchet. At eleven they reached the &s;ummit of Mont Blanc.
Here they continued three hours and a half, during which
time M. de Sau&s;&s;ure enjoyed, with rapture and a&s;toni&s;hment,
a view the mo&s;t exten&s;ive as well as the mo&s;t rugged and
&s;ublime in nature; and made tho&s;e ob&s;ervations which
will render this expedition no longer a matter of mere cu|rio&s;ity.
Until a complete and ample detail of tho&s;e ob&s;er|vations
&s;hall be communicated to the public, you will per|haps
not be di&s;plea&s;ed with the following particulars &s;elected
from a temporary publication of M. de Sau&s;&s;ure him&s;elf<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A tran&s;lation of this account, by the Rev. Mr. Martyn, profe&s;&s;or of botany in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, printed by Kear&s;ley, forms an Appendix to his Sketch of a Tour through Switzerland, which I would recommend to the traveller.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE did not find the cold &s;o extremely piercing as was
experienced by Dr. Paccard and James Balma. By compa|ring
his experiments on Mont Blanc with tho&s;e made at the
&s;ame time by M. Senebier at Geneva, he was enabled to
make the following ob&s;ervations. Reaumur's thermometer
&s;tood in the &s;hade at 2^3^^1^^0 below freezing point, or 27 of
<PB N="360" REF="386">
Fahrenheit; at Geneva at 22. 6, or 82 of Fahrenheit, which
gives a difference of near 25 degrees of Reaumur, or 45 of
Fahrenheit, between the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere at both
places. De Luc's barometer fell to 16. 0 ^1^^1 ^4^^0 ^4^^0, and as it &s;tood
at Geneva at 27. 2 ^1^^1 ^0^^6 ^8^^0 ^5^^0, it gives a difference of 11. 2, without
regarding the fraction. On e&s;timating the height of Mont
Blanc from barometrical experiments, he found it almo&s;t
exactly corre&s;pond with that given by Sir George Schuck|borough,
or 15,662 Engli&s;h feet above the level of the &s;ea,

<P>BY experiments with the hygrometer, the air on the top
of Mont Blanc contained &s;ix times le&s;s humidity than that
of Geneva; and to this extreme dryne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere,
he imputes the burning thir&s;t which he and his compa|nions
experienced. It requires half an hour to boil water on
the top of Mont Blanc, fifteen or &s;ixteen minutes are &s;uffi|cient
at Geneva, and fourteen or fifteen by the &s;ea-&s;ide. By
experiments on the electrometer, the balls diverged only
three lines; the electricity was po&s;itive. On the &s;ummit he
noticed two butterflies on the wing; ob&s;erved, at the eleva|tion
of 11,392 feet above the &s;ea, the <HI>Silene Acaulis,</HI> or mo&s;s
campion, in flower; and &s;till higher up, on the mo&s;t ele|vated
rocks, the <HI>Lichen Sulphureus</HI> and <HI>Lichen Rupe&s;tris</HI> of
Hoffman. He adds, that the &s;ummits of Mont Blanc and the
adjacent mountains are compo&s;ed of granite; and that, next
to Mont Blanc, the Schreckhorn and Mount Ro&s;a in Pied|mont,
appeared the mo&s;t elevated points. M. de Sau&s;&s;ure,
as well as many of his party, found them&s;elves extremely

affected by the rarefaction of the air; and at two began re|turning.
They de&s;cended a little lower than the place in
which they pa&s;&s;ed the preceding night, arrived the next
morning at the valley of Chamouny without the lea&s;t acci|dent,

faces with crape, their &s;kins were not excoriated, nor their

greater difficulty, ari&s;ing from the enlargement of the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONJECTURES ON THE FORMATION AND STATE OF
THE GLACIERS.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ubject in natural hi&s;tory is more curious than the
origin of the&s;e glaciers, extending into fields of corn
and pa&s;ture, and lying, without being melted, in a &s;ituation,
where the &s;un is &s;ufficient to bring vegetation to maturity:
for it is almo&s;t literally true, that with one hand I could
touch ice, and the other ripe corn. As in my fir&s;t expedition
to the alps my &s;tay was exceedingly &s;hort, I declined en|tering
upon a &s;ubject too important to be &s;uperficially treated,
and only threw together a few ha&s;ty remarks, which oc|curred
to me on the &s;pot. But I find that the&s;e remarks,
however ha&s;ty and &s;uperficial, &s;erved to excite your curio&s;ity;
and have induced you to inquire, &startq;<HI>Which is the mo&s;t ra|tional
&s;y&s;tem concerning the formation of the glaciers? Are
they in a &s;tate of augmentation or diminution; or do they re|main
within the &s;ame limits?</HI>&endq; Although in my &s;ub&s;equent
journeys to the alps I made this &s;ubject a particular object of
re&s;earch; and although I have attentively peru&s;ed the prin|cipal
&s;y&s;tems, which have been laid down concerning the for|mation
of glaciers; yet it is not without great di&s;&s;idence, that
I can pre&s;ume to reply to your very arduous que&s;tions.</P>
<P>THE theory of Gruner, confirmed and amended by that
able naturali&s;t M. de Sau&s;&s;ure, appears the mo&s;t &s;imple and
rational; and I do not know how I can better &s;atisfy your
curio&s;ity, than by forming an extract from his much
<PB N="363" REF="389">
e&s;teemed work<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyages des Alps, v. i. c. 7.</NOTE>, inter&s;per&s;ing it with a few additional re|marks
drawn from my own particular ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>IF a per&s;on could be conveyed to &s;uch an elevation as to
embrace at one view the alps of Switzerland, Savoy, and Dau|phin&eacute;,
he would behold a va&s;t chain of mountains, inter&s;ected
by numerous vallies, and compo&s;ed of many parallel chains,
the highe&s;t occupying the center, and the others gradually
dimini&s;hing in proportion to their di&s;tance from that center.
The mo&s;t elevated, or central chain, would appear bri&s;tled
with pointed rocks, and covered, even in &s;ummer, with ice and
&s;now, in all parts that are not ab&s;olutely perpendicular. On
each &s;ide of this chain he would di&s;cover deep vallies clothed
with verdure, peopled with numerous villages, and watered
by many rivers. In con&s;idering the&s;e objects with greater
attention, he would remark, that the central chain is com|po&s;ed
of elevated peaks and diverging ridges, who&s;e &s;um|mits
are over&s;pread with &s;now; that the declivities of the
peaks and ridges, excepting tho&s;e parts that are extremely
&s;teep, are covered with &s;now and ice; and that the interme|diate
depths and &s;paces between them are filled with immen&s;e
fields of ice, terminating in tho&s;e cultivated vallies which
border the great chain. The branches mo&s;t contiguous to
the central chain would pre&s;ent the &s;ame phenomena, only
in a le&s;&s;er degree. At greater di&s;tances no ice would be ob|&s;erved,
and &s;carcely any &s;now, but upon &s;ome of the mo&s;t ele|vated
&s;ummits; and the mountains dimini&s;hing in height
and ruggedne&s;s, would appear covered with herbage, and
gradually &s;ink into hills and plains.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="390">
IN this general &s;urvey, the glaciers may be divided into
two &s;orts; the fir&s;t occupying the deep vallies &s;ituated in the
bo&s;om of the alps, and termed by the natives <HI>Vall&eacute;es de Glace,</HI>
but which I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of <HI>Lower Glaciers;</HI>
the &s;econd, which clothe the &s;ummits and &s;ides of the moun|tains,
I &s;hall call <HI>Upper Glaciers.</HI></P>
<P>1. THE Lower Glaciers are by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
in extent and depth. Some &s;tretch &s;everal leagues in length;
that of des Bois in particular is more than fifteen miles long,
and above three in its greate&s;t breadth. The Lower Glaciers
do not, as is generally imagined, communicate with each
other; and but few of them are parallel to the central chain:
they mo&s;tly &s;tretch in a tran&s;ver&s;e direction, are bordered at
the higher extremity by inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, and on the other
extend into the cultivated vallies. The thickne&s;s of the ice
varies in different parts. M. de Sau&s;&s;ure found its gene|ral
depth in the glacier des Bois from eighty to a hun|dred
feet; but que&s;tions not the information of tho&s;e who
a&s;&s;ert, that in &s;ome places its thickne&s;s exceeds even &s;ix hun|dred
feet.</P>
<P>THESE immen&s;e fields of ice u&s;ually re&s;t on an inclined
plain: being pu&s;hed forwards by the pre&s;&s;ure of their own
weight, and but weakly &s;upported by the rugged rocks be|neath,
are inter&s;ected by large tran&s;ver&s;e cha&s;ms; and pre|&s;ent
the appearance of walls, pyramids, and various fanta&s;tic
&s;hapes, ob&s;erved at all heights and in all &s;ituations, wherever
the declivity exceeds thirty or forty degrees. But in tho&s;e
parts, where the plain on which they re&s;t is horizontal, or
only gently inclined, the &s;urface of the ice is nearly uni|form;
<PB N="365" REF="391">
the cha&s;ms are but few and narrow, and the traveller
cro&s;&s;es on foot, without much difficulty.</P>
<P>THE &s;urface of the ice is not &s;o &s;lippery as that of frozen
ponds or rivers: it is rough and granulated, and is only dan|gerous
to the pa&s;&s;enger in &s;teep de&s;cents. It is not tran&s;pa|rent,
is extremely porous and full of &s;mall bubbles, which
&s;eldom exceed the &s;ize of a pea, and con&s;equently is not &s;o
compact as common ice: its perfect re&s;emblance to the con|gelation
of &s;now impregnated with water, in its opacity,
roughne&s;s, and in the number and &s;mallne&s;s of the air-bubbles,
led M. de Sau&s;&s;ure to conceive the following &s;imple
and natural theory on the formation of the glaciers. An im|men&s;e
quantity of &s;now is continually accumulating in the
elevated vallies which are enclo&s;ed within the alps, as well
from that which falls from the clouds during nine months
in the year, as from the ma&s;&s;es which are ince&s;&s;antly rolling
from the &s;teep &s;ides of the circumjacent mountains. Part of
this &s;now, which is not di&s;&s;olved during &s;ummer, impreg|nated
with rain and &s;now-water, is frozen during winter,
and forms that opaque and porous ice of which the Lower
Glaciers are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>2. THE Upper Glaciers may be &s;ubdivided into tho&s;e
which cover the &s;ummit, and tho&s;e which extend along the
&s;ides of the alps.</P>
<P>THOSE which cover the &s;ummits of the alps, owe their
origin to the &s;now that falls at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and
which remains nearly in its original &s;tate, being congealed
into a hard &s;ub&s;tance, and not converted into ice. For al|though,
<PB N="366" REF="392">
according to the opinion of &s;ome philo&s;ophers, the
&s;ummit of Mont Blanc, and of other elevated mountains, is,
from the gli&s;tening of the &s;urface, &s;uppo&s;ed to be covered
with pure ice; yet it appears, both from theory and expe|rience,
that it is not ice but &s;now. For, in &s;o elevated and
cold a region, there cannot be melted a quantity of &s;now
&s;ufficient to impregnate with water the whole ma&s;s, which
remains undi&s;&s;olved. Experience al&s;o ju&s;tifies this rea&s;oning.
M. de Sau&s;&s;ure found the top of Mont Blanc only encru&s;ted
with ice, which, though of a firm con&s;i&s;tence, was yet penetra|ble
with a &s;tick; and on the declivities of the &s;ummit he di&s;co|vered,
beneath the &s;urface, a &s;oft &s;now without coherence.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance which clothes the &s;ides of the alps is nei|ther
pure &s;now like that of the &s;ummits, nor ice which
forms the Lower Glaciers, but is an a&s;&s;emblage of both. It
contains le&s;s &s;now than the &s;ummits, becau&s;e the &s;ummer
heat has more power to di&s;&s;olve it, and becau&s;e the liquefied
&s;now de&s;cending from above, the ma&s;s is penetrated with a
larger quantity of water. It contains more &s;now than the
Lower Glaciers, becau&s;e the di&s;&s;olution of the &s;now is com|paratively
le&s;&s;er. Hence the ice is even more porous,
opaque, and le&s;s compact than the ice of the Lower Glaciers;
and is of &s;o doubtful a texture as renders it, in many parts,
difficult to decide, whether it may be called ice or frozen
&s;now. In a word, there is a regular gradation from the &s;now
on the &s;ummits to the ice of the Lower Glaciers, formed by
the intermediate mixture of &s;now and ice, which becomes
more compact and le&s;s porous in proportion as it approaches
the Lower Glaciers, until it unites and a&s;&s;imilates with them.
And it is evident, that the greater or le&s;&s;er degree of den&s;ity
<PB N="367" REF="393">
is derived from the greater or le&s;&s;er quantity of water, with
which the ma&s;s is impregnated.</P>
<P>IN regard to your &s;econd que&s;tion, &startq;<HI>Whether the glaciers
are in a &s;tate of increa&s;e or diminution,</HI>&endq; though I declined
on a former occa&s;ion to enter minutely upon a &s;ubject,
which required much accurate ob&s;ervation and repeated ex|perimental
inve&s;tigation; yet I ventured to make one re|mark,
which &s;eemed to prove the occa&s;ional increa&s;e and dimi|nution
of the glaciers; contrary to the opinion of &s;ome philo|&s;ophers,
who maintain, that they continue always the &s;ame,
and of others, who a&s;&s;ert, that they are con&s;tantly increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>THE borders of the glacier of Montanvert, are mo&s;tly
&s;kirted with trees: towards its ba&s;e a va&s;t arch of ice ri&s;es
near a hundred feet in height; under which the Arveron
ru&s;hes with con&s;iderable force, and in a large body of water.
As we approached the ice, we pa&s;&s;ed through a wood of firs:
tho&s;e trees which &s;tand at a little di&s;tance from the arch are
about eighty feet high, and are undoubtedly of a very great
age. Between the&s;e and the glacier, the trees are of a later
growth; as is evident from their texture and inferior &s;ize.
Others, &s;till &s;maller, have been overturned and enveloped
in the ice: there &s;eems to be a kind of regular gradation in
the age of the&s;e &s;everal trees, from the large&s;t which are
&s;tanding to the &s;malle&s;t that lie pro&s;trate. The&s;e facts ju&s;tly
lead to the following conclu&s;ions:&mdash;that the glacier once ex|tended
as far as the row of tall firs; that, upon its gradual
di&s;&s;olution, a number of trees &s;hot up in the very &s;pots
which it formerly occupied; that, &s;ince that period, the ice
has again advanced; and has overturned the trees of later
<PB N="368" REF="394">
growth, before they had attained con&s;iderable height. To
the&s;e circum&s;tances, the following fact may be added.
Large &s;tones of granite are u&s;ually found at a &s;mall di&s;tance
from the extremities of the glacier. The&s;e &s;tones have cer|tainly
fallen from the mountains upon the ice, have been
carried on in its progre&s;s, and have tumbled into the plain
upon the di&s;&s;olution or &s;inking of the ice which &s;upported
them. The&s;e &s;tones, called by the inhabitants <HI>Moraine,</HI> form
a kind of border towards the foot of the valley of ice, and
have been pu&s;hed forward by the glacier in its advances: they
extend even to the place occupied by the larger pines.</P>
<P>AS &s;everal writers upon Switzerland have, in contradic|tion
to the&s;e facts, endeavoured to prove, that the &s;now and
ice are continually accumulating in the alps, I &s;hall here
throw together a few additional remarks, that may tend to
confirm the contrary opinion.</P>
<P>THE Inferior Glacier of Grindelwald was &s;o con&s;iderably
dimini&s;hed &s;ince my fir&s;t expedition in 1776, that the &s;pot
which its extremity then occupied was, in 1785, removed at
lea&s;t four hundred paces from its former &s;ite. In the val|ley
of Chamouny, the <HI>Murailles de Glace,</HI> which I de&s;cribed
as forming the border of the glacier of Bo&s;&s;on, no longer ex|i&s;ted;
and young trees had &s;hot up in the parts which
were then covered by the glacier of Montanvert.</P>
<P>THE advocates for the increa&s;e of the glaciers, admitting
the&s;e facts, yet deny that any judgment can be formed con|cerning
the &s;tate of the more elevated regions, from what
pa&s;&s;es in the vallies, where the &s;un has power to bring the
<PB N="369" REF="395">
fruits of the earth to maturity. They a&s;&s;ert that it appears,
both from theory and fact, that more &s;now falls, and more ice
is annually formed in the alps than can be annually di&s;&s;olved.
To judge from theory; they argue, that the cold occa&s;ioned
by the ma&s;s of ice already formed ought to augment it &s;till
further; and in regard to experience, it is evident, that within
the memory of the pre&s;ent generation, many mountains
have been covered, many pa&s;tures and habitations invaded,
and many pa&s;&s;ages irrecoverably ob&s;tructed by the ice.</P>
<P>IN con&s;idering the arguments drawn from theory, we
may ob&s;erve, that the cau&s;es which tend to the diminution
of the ice, are no le&s;s powerful than the augmentation of the
cold, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to occa&s;ion its indefinite increa&s;e.
The&s;e cau&s;es are principally; 1. rain and &s;leet in the le&s;s ele|vated
regions; 2. evaporation; 3. de&s;cent of the &s;now and
ice, both precipitous and gradual; 4. heat of the atmo|&s;phere;
5. mean temperature of the earth.</P>
<P>1. THE rain and &s;leet, which fall during &s;ummer upon
the Lower Glaciers, not only thaw the ice, but increa&s;e tho&s;e
rills that collect on the &s;urface, excavate channels, de&s;cend
into the clefts, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in forming them. 2. Evaporation
is a &s;till more powerful cau&s;e; as it acts at all heights, and in
all &s;ea&s;ons. 3. The de&s;cent of the &s;now and ice, as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by precipitous and gradual. The precipitous, or
continual fallings of congealed &s;now, termed by the natives
<HI>avalanches,</HI> are detached either by their own weight, &s;often|ed
from their hold by the heat of the &s;un or the warm air
which blows from the &s;outh, or overthrown by the violent
hurricanes that are extremely common in the upper alps.
<PB N="370" REF="396">
When the&s;e ma&s;&s;es are precipitated into a milder region,
though they may &s;ometimes indeed re&s;i&s;t the influence of
heat, and form valleys of ice, yet they are more u&s;ually di&s;|&s;olved.
The&s;e <HI>avalanches</HI> are mo&s;t common in the Upper
Glaciers; whereas the gradual de&s;cent of the ice is chiefly
confined to the Lower Glaciers, and is a very powerful agent
in le&s;&s;ening the aggregate ma&s;s.</P>
<P>ALL the Lower Glaciers, or vallies of ice, re&s;t on an in|clined
plain, are arched or hollow, and are undermined and
weakened by the torrents, which are con&s;tantly flowing, as
well from the Upper Glaciers, as from their own interior
&s;urface. The natural tendency of a heavy body in &s;uch a
po&s;ition is to de&s;cend; and its progre&s;&s;ive motion is accele|rated
in proportion to its own weight, and the greater incli|nation
of its ba&s;is. This progre&s;&s;ive motion, which acts,
though imperceptibly, yet gradually and uniformly, carries
the ice into tho&s;e cultivated plains and vallies, where the &s;un
ripens the fruits of the field; and where a period is nece&s;|&s;arily
put to its farther increa&s;e. If you require a proof of
this imperceptible de&s;cent, the an&s;wer is obvious. It is to be
collected from the facts which I have already enumerated;
namely, from the trees which are occa&s;ionally overturned by
the ice in its progre&s;s, and by the moraine of &s;tones which is
ob&s;erved at the bottom of the Lower Glaciers. The&s;e &s;tones
being &s;imilar to the mountains of the upper alps, and e&s;&s;en|tially
different from the rocks below, mu&s;t have been con|veyed
by the ice in its de&s;cent from the Upper Glaciers.</P>
<P>4. THE heat of the atmo&s;phere, or the effect of the &s;un's
rays on the outward &s;urface of the glaciers, is too evident to
<PB N="371" REF="397">
require any proof, even to tho&s;e who have never been in the
Alps. Another cau&s;e of a thaw, derived from the heat of the
atmo&s;phere, which will not be &s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e who have
not vi&s;ited the&s;e icy regions, is the warm winds which blow
by night as well as by day in the Upper no le&s;s than in the
Lower Glaciers. The&s;e warm winds are, during &s;ummer,
&s;o common in the&s;e parts, that I never cro&s;&s;ed a glacier with|out
feeling, in &s;ome particular po&s;itions, a warmth &s;imilar to
the air of a hot-bath.</P>
<P>5. BUT as the&s;e two cau&s;es only operate in &s;ummer; and
as the &s;un's rays do not produce &s;ufficient effect in the high|e&s;t
parts, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the mean temperature of
the earth, which &s;eems to be the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful
agent in preventing an indefinite augmentation of ice and
&s;now. This mean temperature, termed by &s;ome philo&s;o|phers
the internal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Some philo&s;ophers impute this con&s;tant thaw, which takes place in the lower &s;ur|face of the glaciers, to an internal &s;ource of heat in the earth; but that opinion has been very ably refuted by &s;everal modern natu|rali&s;ts; the mean temperature of the ground being &s;ound &s;ufficient to account for <HI>all</HI> the phenomena, local circum&s;tances excepted, which have been u&s;ually a&s;&s;igned to an inter|nal heat of the earth.</NOTE> heat of the earth, is always above the
freezing point, as is evident from the heat of the &s;prings
which i&s;&s;ue from the bowels of the earth. In winter, there|fore,
or in tho&s;e high regions of the globe where the cold is
u&s;ually below the freezing point, when any &s;pot of ground is
covered with only a thin coat of &s;now, it may be &s;o far cool|ed,
to a certain depth, by the influence of the external air, as
not to be capable of di&s;&s;olving any part of the &s;urperincum|bent
&s;now. But when the ma&s;s of &s;now is of &s;uch a thick|ne&s;s
<PB N="372" REF="398">
as to protect the &s;urface of the ground from the effects
of the atmo&s;pherical cold, the mean temperature, which is
always above the freezing point, will be &s;ufficient to melt
the contiguous &s;urface of &s;now, and to occa&s;ion a con&s;tant
thaw, which &s;upplies tho&s;e currents of water, that flow, at
all &s;ea&s;ons, from the Upper and Lower Glaciers.</P>
<P>IN regard to the argument derived from experience, it is
&s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that while I admit the facts which
prove the progre&s;s of the ice, it by no means &s;eems to follow
that its &s;um is perpetually increa&s;ing. For the advocates
who &s;upport this opinion, while they &s;crupulou&s;ly enume|rate
the places which have been invaded by the ice, do not
take any notice of tho&s;e parts, no le&s;s numerous, from which
the ice has receded. During my &s;econd expedition into the
Alps, I al&s;o made this point of controver&s;y a particular object
of my re&s;earches; and on inquiring from the <HI>cha&s;&s;eurs,</HI> and
other per&s;ons who frequent the mountains, the greate&s;t part
were of opinion that the collection of ice and &s;now, even in
the elevated regions, was by no means in a continual &s;tate of
augmentation; but that while it gained in &s;ome places it di|mini&s;hed
in others; and that upon an average, the aggregate
quantity was nearly the &s;ame.</P>

<P>I OBSERVED at Michael Paccard's, a guide of Chamouny, a

and &s;tuffed &s;pecimens of a female and a young one. As this

Glarus and in the country of the Gri&s;ons. On the town-hall
at Glarus, there is &s;till a pair of horns of an extraordi|nary
length, belonging to an animal of this &s;pecies, for|merly
killed in the canton. The&s;e horns are probably
the &s;ame which Ray &s;aw in the la&s;t century, when the
natives informed him, that the breed was extinct in that
canton.</P>
<P>THAT this animal was found among the Gri&s;ons, appears
from a letter in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of M. de Salis Seervis, dated
the 14th of October, 1574, in which the Archduke Ferdinand
of Au&s;tria requires from his bailif of Ca&s;tels, in the Pretigau,
two bouquetins alive; adding, that he had received &s;everal
from his predece&s;&s;ors. About forty years after the date of
this letter the animal began to be rare; for a decree in the
year 1612 prohibits the chace of the bouquetin under a fine
of fifty crowns, and that of the chamois from New-year's
day to St. John, under the penalty of ten crowns. Sprecher,
in his <HI>Pallas Rhetica,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1617, relates, that the chace
of the bouquetin was not uncommon in his time, in the val|lies
of Pregalia, Vals, and Upper Engadina. Another law of
1633, confirmed in the following year, inflicts corporal pu|ni&s;hment
on tho&s;e who kill a bouquetin. But the&s;e &s;everi|ties
could not pre&s;erve the breed; and it is probable that
this was the epoch of their de&s;truction, when the fear of
their being extinct prompted government to forbid the
<PB N="375" REF="402">
chace<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Franci&s;cus Niger, in his de&s;cription of the Gri&s;ons, as quoted by Conrad Ge&s;ner, &s;ays, that they &s;pare this animal in hunting, becau&s;e it is the armorial bearing of the country.

pre&s;ent generation, no bouquetins have been found in a wild
&s;tate in the country of the Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>THIS animal is now chiefly found upon that chain which
&s;tretches from Dauphin&eacute; through Savoy to the confines of
Italy, and principally on the alps bordering on Mont Blanc,
which is the mo&s;t elevated part of that chain. Its particular
haunts are the valley of Cormayor to the &s;outh of Mont
Blanc, tho&s;e heights which lie between Mont Blanc and the
frontiers of the Vallais, and the mountains which border the
Val Saverenche; but it is met with more abundantly in the
mountains of the valley of Cogne, which is the frontier of
the valley of Dent in Piedmont; and almo&s;t always frequents
tho&s;e parts that have a &s;outhern a&s;pect.</P>

different languages, are, in Greek, by Homer and Aelian, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">

Ibex;</HI> Linnaeus, <HI>Capra Ibex;</HI> Pennant, the <HI>Ibex;</HI> and
Dr. Girtanner, <HI>Capra Alpina.</HI> I have adopted the name of
Bouquetin, becau&s;e it is the provincial appellation of the ani|mal
in the Alps. The &s;y&s;tematic naturali&s;ts agree in taking
the &s;pecific character of the bouquetin from the beard, and
the horns, which they de&s;cribe as knobbed along the upper
or anterior &s;urface, and reclining towards the back.</P>
<P>THE male bouquetin is larger than the tame goat, but re|&s;embles
it much in the outer form. The head is &s;mall in
proportion to the body, with the muzzle thick, compre&s;&s;ed,
and a little arched. The eyes are large, round, and have
much &s;ire and brilliancy. The horns large, when of a full
&s;ize weighing &s;ometimes 16 or 18 pounds, flatted before and
rounded behind, with one or two longitudinal, and many
tran&s;ver&s;e ridges; which degenerate towards the tip into
knobs; the colour du&s;ky brown. The beard long, tawny,
or du&s;ky. The legs &s;lender, with the hoofs &s;hort, hollow on
the in&s;ide, and on the out&s;ide terminated by a &s;alient border,
like tho&s;e of the chamois. The body &s;hort, thick, and
&s;trong. The tail &s;hort, naked underneath, the re&s;t covered
with long hairs, white at the ba&s;e and &s;ides, black above and
at the end. Space under the tail in &s;ome tawny, in others
white. The coat long, but not pendent, a&s;h coloured, mixed
with &s;ome hoary hairs: a black li&s;t runs along the back; and
<PB N="377" REF="404">
there is a black &s;pot above and below the knees. Its colour,
however, like that of other animals, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily vary ac|cording
to its age and local circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE female has been little noticed among naturali&s;ts.
She is one-third le&s;s than the male, and not &s;o corpulent:
her colour is le&s;s tawny: her horns are very &s;mall and not
above eight inches long. In the&s;e, and in her figure, &s;he re|&s;embles
a goat that has been ca&s;trated whil&s;t young. She
has two teats, like the tame &s;he-goat, and never has any
beard, unle&s;s, perhaps, in an advanced age. The young
ones are of a dirty grey colour, and the li&s;t along the back is
&s;carcely di&s;cernible.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;tuffed &s;pecimen of the male bouquetin of
the alps in Mr. Parkin&s;on's, late Sir A&s;hton Lever's, Mu&s;eum,

<P>THOSE in the &s;econd and third columns certainly belong
to the bouquetin of the alps. Their colour is a du&s;ky
brown. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is very flat before; the &s;econd is
not &s;o flat; neither the longitudinal nor tran&s;ver&s;e ridges
are &s;o very &s;trongly marked: the&s;e are evidently the horns
<PB N="379" REF="406">
of a very old animal. The horns in the fourth column
belong al&s;o to the bouquetin; but probably from &s;ome other
country. Their colour is black; they are much flatter on
the &s;ides, and narrower before than the others; the longitu|dinal
ridge is very &s;trongly marked, and the tran&s;ver&s;e
ridges &s;tronger and more numerous. I cannot ob&s;erve more
than one<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t naturali&s;ts affirm, that the horns are marked with <HI>two</HI> longitudinal ridges; all tho&s;e that have fallen under my ob&s;er|vation have only <HI>one</HI> interior longitudinal ridge, and a faint mark on the exterior edge, which is probably taken for the <HI>&s;econd</HI> lon|gitudinal ridge.</NOTE> longitudinal ridge in any of the horns which I
have examined, the exterior part of the front being univer|&s;ally
rounded off, and the tran&s;ver&s;e ridges run very little
into the &s;ides. The horns in the fifth column belong un|que&s;tionably
to the Aegagrus of Pallas, which is not impro|bably
a variety of the bouquetin. Two fine pairs of the&s;e
horns were given to the Mu&s;eum by the late duke of Nor|thumberland.
They have no anterior flat face, but a &s;harp
ridge, with a few knobs in front, about nine in number, and
very di&s;tant from each other; they are &s;treaked tran&s;ver&s;ely,
more evidently towards the end. Their extremities are
much arched, with the points turning inwards. The colour
is the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the alpine bouquetins.</P>
<P>IT is a common notion of the hunters, adopted by many
naturali&s;ts, that the age of a bouquetin may be e&s;timated by
the number of tran&s;ver&s;e ridges or knobs in the horns. M.
van Berchem, however, a&s;&s;ures me, from his own ob&s;erva|tions,
that this is a vulgar error; and that its age can only
be a&s;certained by the number and form of the teeth, as in
<PB N="380" REF="407">
&s;heep and goats. This mi&s;take has al&s;o occa&s;ioned its term
of life to be &s;uppo&s;ed much longer than it really is. This
animal increa&s;es in bulk to the age of four years; according,
therefore, to the &s;y&s;tem of the Count de Buffon, that the
age is about &s;even times the growth, its life is twenty-eight
or thirty years.</P>
<P>IN a &s;tate of tranquillity, the bouquetin commonly car|ries
the head low; but in running holds it high, and
even bends it a little forward. He mounts a perpendicular
rock of fifteen feet at three leaps, or rather three &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
bounds of five feet each. It does not &s;eem as if he
found any footing on the rock, appearing to touch it merely
to be repelled, like an ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance &s;triking again&s;t a hard
body. He is not &s;uppo&s;ed to take more than three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
leaps in this manner. If he is between two rocks which
are near each other, and wants to reach the top, he leaps
from the &s;ide of one rock to the other alternately, till he has
attained the &s;ummit. He al&s;o traver&s;es the glaciers with
rapidity; but only when pur&s;ued, for otherwi&s;e he avoids
them.</P>
<P>THE bouquetins feed, during the night, in the highe&s;t
woods: but the &s;un no &s;ooner begins to gild the &s;ummits,
than they quit the woody region, and mount, feeding in
their progre&s;s, till they have reached the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
heights. They betake them&s;elves to the &s;ides of the moun|tains
which face the ea&s;t or &s;outh, and lie down in the highe&s;t
places and hotte&s;t expo&s;ures: but when the &s;un has fini&s;hed
more than three-quarters of its cour&s;e, they again begin to
<PB N="381" REF="408">
feed, and to de&s;cend towards the woods; whither they retire
when it is likely to &s;now, and where they always pa&s;s the
winter. The bouquetins a&s;&s;emble in flocks, con&s;i&s;ting at the
mo&s;t of ten, twelve, or fifteen; but more u&s;ually in &s;maller
numbers. The males which are &s;ix years old and upwards,
haunt more elevated places than the females and younger
bouquetins; and as they advance in age are le&s;s fond of
&s;ociety; they become gradually hardened again&s;t the effects
of extreme cold, and frequently live entirely alone.</P>
<P>IN &s;ummer they feed principally on the <HI>genipi</HI> and other
aromatic plants which grow in the high alps; and in
winter they eat the lichens, and brou&s;e on bu&s;hes and the
tender &s;hoots of trees. They prefer tho&s;e &s;pots where the
dwarf birch and alpine willows grow, and where <HI>rhododen|dron,
thalictrum,</HI> and <HI>&s;axifrages,</HI> abound. The bouquetins
having their fore legs &s;omewhat &s;horter than the hind legs,
naturally a&s;cend with greater facility than they de&s;cend;
for this rea&s;on nothing but the &s;evere&s;t weather can engage
them to come down into the lower regions; and even in
winter, if there are a few fine days, they leave the woods
and mount higher.</P>
<P>WINTER is the &s;ea&s;on of love with them, and principally
the month of January. The females go with young five
months, and con&s;equently produce in the la&s;t week of June,
or the fir&s;t of July. At the time of parturition they &s;eparate
from the males, retire to the &s;ide of &s;ome rill, and generally
bring forth only one young, though &s;ome naturali&s;ts affirm
that they occa&s;ionally produce two. The common cry of
<PB N="382" REF="409">
the bouquetin is a &s;hort &s;harp whi&s;tle, not unlike that of the
chamois, but of le&s;s continuance: &s;ometimes it makes a
&s;nort, and when young bleats.</P>
<P>THE &s;ea&s;on for hunting the bouquetin is towards the
end of &s;ummer, and in autumn, during the months of
Augu&s;t and September, when they are u&s;ually in good con|dition.
None but the inhabitants of the mountains engage
in the chace; for it requires not only a head that can bear to
look down from the greate&s;t heights without terror, addre&s;s
and &s;ure-footedne&s;s in the mo&s;t difficult and dangerous
pa&s;&s;es, and to be an excellent mark&s;man, but al&s;o much
&s;trength and vigour to &s;upport hunger, cold, and prodigious
fatigue. The mo&s;t determined hunters of bouquetins live
in the mountains of the Lower Vallais; for in&s;tance, the
natives of Servan, a village in a wild and picture&s;que &s;itua|tion,
four leagues from Valor&s;ine, and two or three from
Martigny, are hunters, and the bouquetins being no longer
found in their mountains, they hunt in tho&s;e of the valley of
Ao&s;t, obtaining a permi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e from the in|habitants.</P>
<P>Two or three hunters u&s;ually a&s;&s;ociate in this perilous oc|cupation:
they are armed with rifle-barrelled guns, and fur|ni&s;hed
with &s;mall bags of provi&s;ions; they pa&s;s the night
among rocks at con&s;iderable heights; they erect a mi&s;erable
hut of turf, where they lie without fire or covering, and on
waking not unfrequently find the entrance blocked up with
&s;now three or four feet in depth. Sometimes, in the pur&s;uit
of a bouquetin, being overtaken by darkne&s;s amid crags and
<PB N="383" REF="410">
precipices, they are obliged to pa&s;s the whole night &s;tanding
embraced, in order to &s;upport each other, and to prevent
them&s;elves from &s;leeping. As the bouquetins a&s;cend into the
higher regions very early in the morning, it is nece&s;&s;ary to
gain the heights before them, otherwi&s;e they &s;cent the hunter
and betake them&s;elves to flight: it would then be in vain to
follow them, for when once they begin to e&s;cape, they never
&s;top till they think them&s;elves entirely out of danger, and
will even &s;ometimes run for ten or twelve leagues.</P>
<P>THE female &s;hows much attachment to her young, and
even defends it again&s;t eagles, wolves, and other enemies:
&s;he takes refuge in &s;ome cavern, and pre&s;enting her head at
the entrance of the hole, thus oppo&s;es the enemy. When
a bouquetin is &s;hot, the hunters let it cool upon the &s;pot,
and then embowel it, putting the blood into one of the
entrails, which is e&s;teemed by the pea&s;ants a &s;overeign re|medy
in pluri&s;ies and &s;ome other di&s;orders. A large bou|quetin
thus embowelled will weigh 180 or 200 pounds. A
female weighs only from 70 to 80 pounds.</P>
<P>SOME naturali&s;ts are of opinion, that the diminution of
the race of bouquetins in the Alps is owing to his &s;ize, the
mon&s;trous length and weight of the horns, which impede
him in his cour&s;e; becau&s;e he is driven into places where
he can &s;carcely procure &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment during great
part of the year, where his &s;ight becomes debilitated, and is
frequently lo&s;t by the &s;trong reflection of the &s;un from the
ice and &s;now. They con&s;ider this animal rather as a native
of the &s;ubalpine regions, which are covered during &s;ummer
<PB N="384" REF="411">
with the fine&s;t herbage, and where the bouquetins and cha|mois
probably pa&s;tured in tranquillity, when only the lower
vallies and plains were inhabited.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, it is maintained by others, that the
bouquetin is endued with &s;trength proportionate to his &s;ize:
and though he is inferior to the chamois in liveline&s;s and
agility, yet he is by no means deficient in activity; that his
horns, though large and weighty, yet from their reclined
po&s;ition do not &s;eem to be any impediment, but rather
render him e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice when he happens to fall, or pur|po&s;ely
throws him&s;elf down precipices to avoid his pur&s;uers.
They add al&s;o, that his natural food is rather lichens than
herbs; that he is particularly fond of the young &s;hoots of
trees and &s;hrubs; and that in all the places where he in|habits,
he is found in the colde&s;t and rude&s;t mountains, and
on the &s;teepe&s;t rocks. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is not
improbable, that his pre&s;ent &s;ituation and manner of life is
an effect of nature rather than nece&s;&s;ity. Be&s;ides, why do
the chamois, who are more hunted than the bouquetin, &s;till
inhabit the le&s;s elevated regions; and why are they not
driven among the glaciers? To account for the pre&s;ent
&s;carcity of the bouquetin, we need only con&s;ider the number
of its enemies, in men, bea&s;ts, and birds of prey. Nor is
there much cau&s;e for apprehen&s;ions, that the race will be
extinct even in the Alps. But allowing that the bouquetin
was no longer found in his native Alps, &s;till we could not
affirm with &s;o much propriety that the race was extinct, as
that it had migrated into a milder climate, and, with a &s;tate
of dome&s;tication and more &s;ucculent food, had acquired &s;ofter
<PB N="385" REF="412">
manners, a form le&s;s rude, &s;maller and &s;moother horns. For
it is even not improbable, that the <HI>hircus ferus</HI> or bouc-e&s;tain
of Belon, the bouquetin of the Alps, the Siberian ibex, and
aegagrus, both &s;o accurately de&s;cribed by Pallas<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Perhaps al&s;o the <HI>capra cauca&s;ica,</HI> de|&s;cribed by Pallas, from the papers of Gul|den&s;taedt, and which he repre&s;ents as differ|ing from the aegagrus, with which it has been confounded by &s;ome naturali&s;ts. See Act. Petr. for 1779.</NOTE>, and the
tame goat in all its different forms, are only varieties of the
&s;ame &s;pecies. Their difference in &s;hape and manners may
be &s;ufficiently accounted for from a change of climate, &s;itua|tion,
and food; they are found to couple freely with each
other; and are a&s;&s;erted to produce an offspring which is
fertile.</P>
<P>THEY all have a beard, which &s;eems to be the great cha|racteri&s;tic
di&s;tinction of this genus. They differ more or le&s;s
from each other in the &s;hape of their horns, &s;ize, and coat,
none of which can be e&s;teemed certain &s;pecific di&s;tinctions.
The greate&s;t difference undoubtedly con&s;i&s;ts in the horns,
none of them, perhaps, except the bouquetin, having a lon|gitudinal
ridge, and &s;ome of them being even without the
tran&s;ver&s;e ridges. But this difference is le&s;s perceptible, in
comparing the bouquetin with the Siberian ibex, the ibex
with the aegagrus, and the aegagrus with the tame goat.
Nor are the horns of the Alpine bouquetin &s;o much weigh|tier,
longer, and larger, than tho&s;e of the Siberian ibex and
aegagrus, as to form a <HI>certain</HI> &s;pecific di&s;tinction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The horns of the bouquetin, as has been before ob&s;erved, are &s;ometimes found to weigh &s;ixteen or eighteen pounds, to be three feet in length, and to have twenty|four tran&s;ver&s;e ridges. A &s;ingle horn of a Siberian ibex weighed, according to Pallas, eight Ru&s;&s;ian pounds, which is one-tenth le&s;s than an Engli&s;h pound, and had &s;ixteen or eighteen tran&s;ver&s;e ridges. The horns of another full grown Siberian ibex mea&s;ured 2 feet 5 inches and 5 lines, along the cur|vature, and 1 foot 2 inches and 1 line, in a rectilinear direction. The horns of an aega|grus mea&s;ured 2 feet 2 inches and 9 lines along the curvature, and 1 foot 4 inches in a linear direction. The horns of a full grown Cau|ca&s;an goat, were 2 feet 4 inches along the curvature, and 1 foot 6 inches in the linear direction. The longitudinal ridge or ridges remain then as the <HI>only</HI> &s;pecific difference between the horns of the alpine bouquetin and tho&s;e of the other &s;pecies. See the mea&s;urements in Pallas Spic. Zool. and in his De&s;cription of the Capra Cauca&s;ica, in Act. Petr. for 1779.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="413">
BUT even were this difference &s;till greater, it could never
be admitted as forming a &s;pecific di&s;tinction. For the horns
not only vary in individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but in the
&s;ame individuals at different ages. If we were to attempt to
arrange animals <HI>&s;olely</HI> by their horns, the di&s;criminations
would be as endle&s;s as uncertain. But if, in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance,
the alpine bouquetin and the other &s;pecies of the
goat genus &s;hould be excepted from this general a&s;&s;ertion,
we have only to add, that M. van Berchem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the
horns of a young one, produced from the union of the bou|quetin
and &s;he-goat, that are exactly &s;imilar to the horns of
the aegagrus, which, as Pallas a&s;&s;erts, re&s;emble tho&s;e of the
tame goat. Climate and nutriment mu&s;t have a great effect
upon the horns of animals. The female of the bouquetin
has horns very like tho&s;e of the tame goat. It is no
wonder, therefore, if a long &s;ervitude, an inactive life,
an exchange from the aromatic plants and pure air of
the mountains to a gro&s;s nutriment and a moi&s;ter atmo|&s;phere,
&s;hould dimini&s;h the horns, alter their &s;hape, &s;ub|due
the longitudinal ridge, and convert the knobs into
wrinkles.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="414">
THE Count de Buffon extends the goat genus &s;till fur|ther,
and comprehends under it even the chamois; conjec|turing,
that the bouquetin is the male in the original race of
goats, and the chamois the female. The French naturali&s;t
having, at the time when he de&s;cribed the bouquetin, never
&s;een it in a full grown &s;tate, was probably induced to enter|tain
this opinion from a faint re&s;emblance between the fe|male
bouquetin and the chamois. But there does not &s;eem
the lea&s;t foundation for this notion, the chamois being an
animal totally di&s;tinct from the goats, never coupling with
them, and judiciou&s;ly cla&s;&s;ed by Pallas and Pennant in the
genus of antelopes. His conjecture, however, that the bou|quetin
is the original &s;ource of all the tame goats &s;eems to
be well founded; and has been adopted by the greate&s;t part
of &s;ucceeding naturali&s;ts. And as, according to the ju&s;t ob|&s;ervations
of Pallas, the aegagrus approaches nearer than
the bouquetin to the tame goat in its form and horns, the
aegagrus may be the link which unites the bouquetin and
the tame goat. May not the aegagrus be con&s;idered as a
race produced from the bouquetin and the &s;he-goat, or the
goat and female bouquetin? Pallas al&s;o conjectures, that
the tame goat may po&s;&s;ibly have been propagated from the
aegagrus and Siberian ibex, which is allowed by mo&s;t natu|rali&s;ts
to be the &s;ame as the bouquetin; and Pennant re|marks,
with no le&s;s &s;agacity, that the tame goats may be de|rived
from both, as we are a&s;&s;ured that the ibex and &s;he-goat
will produce a &s;imilar offspring. It is al&s;o probable, that the
bouquetin is the origin of all the goat genus, becau&s;e it is
the large&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t, and dwells in the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable
regions. For, according to the ob&s;ervation of the &s;ame great
<PB N="388" REF="415">
zoologi&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pallas.</NOTE>, whom we have &s;o often quoted, tho&s;e animals
who are natives of the colde&s;t mountains mu&s;t, on de&s;cend|ing
into the warm plains, be liable to greater changes than
tho&s;e who are formed for milder climates; and this circum|&s;tance
&s;eems &s;ufficient to account for the great variety ob&s;erv|able
in the goat genus.</P>
<P>SOME naturali&s;ts pretend, that the bouquetin cannot be the
original &s;tock from whence the goats have been produced, be|cau&s;e,
as he inhabits only the loftie&s;t &s;ummits and rocks cover|ed
with eternal &s;now, and feeds only on plants peculiar to high
regions, he cannot be dome&s;ticated in a variety of climates.
But this opinion is contradicted by fact and experience.
Stumpf, the hi&s;torian of Switzerland, informs us, that the Val|lai&s;ans
near Sion bred up tame bouquetins with their goats;
and Belon relates, that the Cretans tamed the young bouc|e&s;tains
by giving them to be &s;uckled by the goats. Dr. Pal|las
al&s;o relates, that he has frequently &s;een the Siberian ibex
among the tame goats, and mentions one in particular at
Orenburgh, which was leader of a flock, and father of a nu|merous
offspring more re&s;embling the females than him&s;elf.
He was very different from the tame he-goats, &s;carcely in|ferior
in &s;ize to a bouquetin two years old: in colour and
&s;trength he re&s;embled the wild animal; had thick horns,
knobbed, not keeled above, and a long rough coat, but the
hair no where pendent, except in the beard: the black li&s;t
on the back was almo&s;t obliterated. And la&s;tly, Mr. van
Berchem &s;aw &s;everal tame bouquetins at Aigle. They were
<PB N="389" REF="416">
gentle and familiar; and, without being remarkably lively,
were active and graceful in all their motions. They bred
with different &s;he-goats, and Mr. van Berchem &s;aw the
young ones, which &s;eemed to form a new race.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;hould be well founded, the goat
genus, or race of the bouquetin, is found in a wild &s;tate
along the chain of mountains that traver&s;es the temperate
parts both of Europe and A&s;ia; on the Alps, Pyrenees, and
Carpathian mountains; on the Taurus and Cauca&s;us; on
the mountains of Siberia and Tartary; in Kamtchatka; on
the i&s;lands of the Archipelago; in Hedsjaeas in Arabia; in
India; perhaps in Aegypt and Lybia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

THE FIFTH&mdash;VEVAY&mdash;TOMB
AND CHARACTER OF GENERAL LUDLOW&mdash;CLARENS&mdash;MEILLERIE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING quitted the delightful vale of Chamouny and
its magnificent &s;cenery, we continued our route to|wards
Geneva. As we proceeded, the height of the moun|tains
gradually dimini&s;hed; and the &s;everal vallies, through
which we pa&s;&s;ed, were agreeably diver&s;ified in their figures
and productions. We followed the cour&s;e of the &s;onorous
and violent Arve; and near Salenche we came to a de&s;cent,
where on our right hand we de&s;cried a &s;mall lake, the &s;itu|ation
whereof is extremely picture&s;que; and who&s;e borders,
&s;kirted with wood, are plea&s;ing and diver&s;ified. From hence
we de&s;cended into the plain, which continues almo&s;t per|fectly
level to Geneva. Salenche lies at the bottom of a
broad valley, which here contracts to a narrow pa&s;s. Tra|dition
&s;ays, that this little plain was once a lake; and indeed
its form, and the quality of the &s;oil, &s;eem to ju&s;tify tradition:
great part is laid wa&s;te by the unruly Arve, which frequent|ly
overflows its banks; and the re&s;t is mo&s;tly covered with
fruit-trees.</P>
<P>NOT far from Magland we &s;topped to admire a beautiful
fall of water, called the ca&s;cade of Arpenas, which ru&s;hes,
<PB N="392" REF="419">
like the Staubbach, from an impending rock. When I &s;aw
it, there was a con&s;iderable wind, which drove the torrent,
&s;oon after its leaving the rock, at lea&s;t an hundred yards out
of the perpendicular direction, into an almo&s;t imperceptible
&s;pray: I then beheld it trickling down the &s;ide of the moun|tains
in a thou&s;and little &s;treams, which united at a ridge;
and from thence formed three ca&s;cades. The body of water
was much more con&s;iderable<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It may be nece&s;&s;ary to apprize the traveller, that, in dry &s;ummers, this ca&s;cade is &s;ometimes almo&s;t de&s;titute of water, le&s;t, &s;eeing it under that circum&s;tance, he &s;hould conceive the de&s;cription in the text to be too much exaggerated.</NOTE> than that of the Staubbach;
and the fall appeared to me altogether as high. Between
Magland and Clu&s;e we took a guide to conduct us to the cave
of <HI>la Balme.</HI> Though the a&s;cent was not very long, yet it
was &s;o &s;teep that we were nearly an hour in reaching it; we
then &s;crambled along a precipice, from which we mounted a
ladder; and by the aid of the branches of a nut-tree growing
from the rock, we pulled our&s;elves into a natural cavern
more than a quarter of a mile in length, and forming va|rious
branches that led into lofty vaults and &s;pacious open|ings;
but the &s;ight of which did not an&s;wer the trouble re|quired
to enter it.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;&s;ed the night at Clu&s;e, which is &s;ituated by the
&s;ide of the Arve; and the next morning came down the
banks of that river to Bonneville, the capital of Faucigny: it
&s;tands al&s;o upon the Arve, at the bottom of a chain of rocks,
which from this place dimini&s;h into hills. All this part of
Faucigny, as al&s;o a &s;mall &s;trip of Chablais through which
we pa&s;&s;ed, is a rich plain, that produces wine and corn in
<PB N="393" REF="420">
great plenty; but is neither populous nor well cultivated.
By the little village of Chene we entered into the territory of
Geneva: the &s;udden change from the poverty of the Sa|voyards
to the neatne&s;s and ea&s;e of the Genevans, the popu|lou&s;ne&s;s
of the country, the richne&s;s of its cultivation, and
the number of country-&s;eats &s;cattered about the fields, were
circum&s;tances that affected me with a plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction.
As I propo&s;e vi&s;iting Geneva again, in my way to the &s;outh
of France, I will defer giving any account of that intere&s;ting
town until my return.</P>
<P>WE went from Geneva to Cra&s;&s;i, a &s;mall village in the
Pays de Vaud, where we pa&s;&s;ed a day with an Engli&s;h gen|tleman,
who has taken a hou&s;e for the &s;ummer in that de|lightful
&s;pot. In our way to Cra&s;&s;i we pa&s;&s;ed through Ver|&s;oi,
a little village in the French territories, upon the lake of
Geneva, known by the name of <HI>Choi&s;eul's Folly.</HI> Geneva ha|ving
fallen under the di&s;plea&s;ure of France; that mini&s;ter
endeavouring to take advantage of the troubles in 1768, laid
a plan to ruin the town, and to monopoli&s;e the whole trade
of the lake. Accordingly he fixed upon Ver&s;oi as a &s;itua|tion
the mo&s;t proper, upon which to build a large town.
For this purpo&s;e, he began by &s;inking a pier and making an
harbour: he con&s;tructed al&s;o a frigate; marked out the
&s;treets; &s;ent a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;tone to build the
hou&s;es; ordered a garri&s;on, and erected huts for them, in
which they continued &s;ome time. Neverthele&s;s, when the
harbour was nearly fini&s;hed, and government had expended
about &pound;. 125,000, the &s;cheme was relinqui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="421">
THE road from Geneva to Lau&s;anne runs through the
<HI>Pays de Vaud,</HI> a region of which hi&s;torians and travellers
&s;peak with rapture; particularly of that part which borders
upon the lake of Geneva: and indeed a more delightful
country cannot well be imagined. It is, almo&s;t the whole
way, a gradual a&s;cent from the edge of the lake, richly laid
out in vineyards, corn-fields, and luxuriant meadows; and
checquered with continued hamlets, villages, and towns:
the &s;hores are generally of the cleane&s;t gravel; and the water
is of &s;o fine a tran&s;parency, that you may &s;ee the bottom to a
very con&s;iderable depth. We pa&s;&s;ed through Nyon, which
&s;tands delightfully upon the edge of the lake, and in the
very point where it begins to widen. It was formerly called
<HI>Colonia Eque&s;tris Noiodunum;</HI> and as a proof of its antiquity,
&s;everal Roman in&s;criptions, and other antient remains, have
been frequently di&s;covered in the out-&s;kirts of the town. In
this part the lake forms a beautiful curve, happily alluded
to by Lucan, where he mentions the army of Julius Cae&s;ar
&s;triking their tents, which were po&s;ted on the borders.</P>

<P>ALL the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this country formerly belonging to
the duke of Savoy, were wre&s;ted from him in the war, which
the canton of Berne declared again&s;t him, in 1536, in defence
of Geneva: and in the &s;ame year the reformation was intro|duced.
From that period all the Pays de Vaud, excepting
<PB N="395" REF="422">
the common bailliages of Gran&s;on, Orbe, and a &s;mall portion of
it which was ceded to Friburgh, has been &s;ubject to Berne,
and makes part of that canton.</P>
<P>MORGES, which is &s;ituated at the extremity of a beauti|ful
bay, is the neate&s;t town in the&s;e parts. The environs
are extremely plea&s;ant; the banks of the lake form an am|phitheatre
gently ri&s;ing to the Jura; and Mont Blanc pre|&s;ents
it&s;elf through an immen&s;e opening in the oppo&s;ite
chain of rocks, which &s;eems to have been formed by nature
in order to exhibit a &s;ublime per&s;pective of that beautiful
mountain. Near the town is a lime-tree of a great &s;ize, be|ing
twenty-four feet four inches in circumference, and with
branches of magnificent extent; it has a companion about
three feet le&s;s in girth. Mr. Pennant informs me, that
&startq;this tree is a native of Switzerland, and of many other
parts of the continent; that it was imported into England
before the year 1562; one being de&s;cribed by Dr. William
Turner as growing in a park near Colche&s;ter; that one
thirty-&s;ix feet in circumference grew near the great church
at Berne; it was planted about the year 1410; and its hollow
trunk, &s;till putting forth leaves, was to be &s;een in the year
1702<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A large lime is to be &s;een on the heights above Villars, a &s;eat belonging to Mr. Graffenred of Berne, near Morat. Its girth mea&s;ures at lea&s;t thirty-&s;ix feet in cir|cumference, and its height is not le&s;s than ninety feet. It is very antient, as it was lopped in 1550, for the &s;ake of the bark. The traveller who vi&s;its this tree, will be no le&s;s gratified with an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, commanding the lakes of Morat, Neuchatel, and Bienne, and that &s;tupendous chain of &s;nowy alps which is repre&s;ented on the en|graving in&s;erted in this volume.</NOTE>. The Germans, in old times, were fond of planting
the lime before their churches and in the market-places, on
<PB N="396" REF="423">
account of its grateful &s;hade. This tree is now grown much
out of u&s;e; yet the Romans e&s;teemed it &s;o highly, as to &s;ay
that it was employed for a thou&s;and purpo&s;es, <HI>tiliae ad mille
u&s;us petendae.</HI> A &s;weet juice exudes from the leaves and bark,
from which the Poles extract a honey called by them Lie|piz<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;cogere pre&s;&s;is</L>

in his beautiful de&s;cription of the indu&s;trious Corycian, places
the lime and the pine in the neighbourhood of his hives.&endq;</P>
<P>LAUSANNE contains about &s;even thou&s;and inhabitants:
it is built upon an a&s;cent &s;o &s;teep, that in &s;ome places the
hor&s;es cannot, without great difficulty, draw up a carriage;
and foot-pa&s;&s;engers a&s;cend to the upper part of the town
by &s;teps. But the&s;e inconveniences are amply compen&s;ated
by the &s;ublime&s;t views in nature, commanding the lake
of Geneva, the Pays de Vaud, and the rugged coa&s;t of
Chablais.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame year in which part of the Pays de Vaud was
conquered from the hou&s;e of Savoy, the bi&s;hop of Lau&s;anne,
retiring from the town, the inhabitants put them&s;elves under
the protection and &s;overeignty of the canton of Berne;
which confirmed and augmented their privileges. At
pre&s;ent, Lau&s;anne is governed by its own magi&s;trates; has
its own courts of ju&s;tice; and, what is very &s;ingular, the
citizens, who po&s;&s;e&s;s hou&s;es in the principal &s;treet, enjoy
the privilege of pronouncing &s;entence in criminal cau&s;es.
<PB N="397" REF="424">
The criminal is tried by the civil power: if he is found, and ac|knowledges
him&s;elf guilty, the burghers of this &s;treet a&s;&s;em|ble;
one of the magi&s;trates pleads in defence of the pri&s;oner,
and another again&s;t him; the court of ju&s;tice give their opinion
upon the point of law; and the majority of the citizens, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
hou&s;es in the principal &s;treet, determine the penalty.
If the puni&s;hment is capital, there is, according to the letter
of the law, no pardon, unle&s;s obtained within twenty-four
hours from the &s;overeign council of Berne; although it
generally happens, that eight days are granted for that pur|po&s;e.
When the criminal is &s;eized within the juri&s;diction of
the town; the fact is tried, and the burghers pronounce
&s;entence, in the town-hall: in this ca&s;e there is no appeal.
But, when he is taken within the di&s;trict of the bailif, they
a&s;&s;emble in his hou&s;e; and an appeal lies from their deter|mination
to Berne. I have been the more particular in my
inquiries concerning the mode of this criminal proce&s;s, from
the &s;trong re&s;emblance it bears, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to our trial
by juries. Here is an academy for the &s;tudents of this coun|try:
profe&s;&s;ors in every &s;cience are appointed by govern|ment;
and there is a tolerable library for the u&s;e of the
public.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;everal times had the good fortune to meet
Ti&s;&s;ot, the celebrated phy&s;ician of this place; well known
in the literary world for his excellent writings upon &s;everal
medical &s;ubjects. His conver&s;ation is uncommonly intere&s;t|ing;
as, be&s;ides his &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, he is well ver&s;ed
in every branch of polite literature. His private character is
no le&s;s re&s;pectable than his public; and he is as much
<PB N="398" REF="425">
e&s;teemed for his great humanity as for his &s;uperior know|ledge.</P>
<P>THE church of Lau&s;anne, formerly the cathedral, is a
magnificent gothic building, &s;tanding on the mo&s;t elevated
part of the town. It contains, among many other &s;epulchres,
the tomb of Amadeus the Eighth, duke of Savoy, &s;tyled the
Solomon of his age; but more known by the name of the
anti-pope Felix the Fifth; who exhibited a &s;ingular in&s;tance
in the annals of Europe, of a per&s;onage <HI>twice</HI> abdicating the
pomp of &s;overeignty, and <HI>twice</HI> retiring to a private &s;tation.
Having pa&s;&s;ed his early youth and opening manhood in the
pur&s;uits of ambition, he enlarged his dominions by the ac|qui&s;ition
of the Genevois and Piedmont, and obtained an
increa&s;e of rank by the erection of Savoy into a dutchy. Yet
in the mid&s;t of his greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and when fortune &s;eemed
mo&s;t propitious, the &s;udden death of a beloved wife, and a
narrow e&s;cape from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, in&s;pired him with &s;uch a
di&s;gu&s;t of the world, that he re&s;igned, in 1434, the admini|&s;tration
of his e&s;tates to his elde&s;t &s;on; and, accompanied
with a few lords of his court, retired to a palace at La Ri|paille,
on the borders of the lake of Geneva. In this palace,
which he called an <HI>hermitage,</HI> he enjoyed, with an apparent
indifference to the affairs of the world, a calm and tranquil|lity
that &s;eemed incompatible with his former a&s;piring am|bition;
until he was &s;uddenly called forth to public notice in
a more exalted &s;tation.</P>
<P>THE council of Ba&s;le having depo&s;ed Eugenius the
Fourth, induced, according to &s;ome authors, by the reputa|tion
<PB N="399" REF="426">
which Amadeus had acquired for &s;anctity, influenced,
according to others, by his large&s;&s;es and intrigues, rai&s;ed the
<HI>hermit</HI> of La Ripaille to the papal throne. This event took
place in 1439: the new pontiff quitting his favourite retreat,
accepted the proffered dignity, either with a real or affected
reluctance, and a&s;&s;umed the name of Felix the Fifth. The
aera of his di&s;puted pontificate was marked with turbulence
and anarchy. In order to avoid the &s;torms which agitated
Europe, and to favour the natural indolence of his temper,
he frequently retreated to his beloved hermitage, and direct|ed
the affairs of the church from that &s;eque&s;tered corner.
Con&s;cious at length that his acceptance of the papacy &s;erved
to widen in&s;tead of healing the &s;chi&s;m of the church; find|ing
that he was oppo&s;ed by the mo&s;t powerful princes of
Europe; that, on the death of his rival Eugenius, the car|dinals
of Rome had cho&s;en another pope; and being ill
&s;upported by the remains of the council of Ba&s;le, he termi|nated
the &s;chi&s;m by re&s;igning the papal tiara in favour of
Nicholas the Fifth. In this tran&s;action he proved his ta|lents
for negotiation by obtaining the following conditions:
that he &s;hould enjoy the next rank to the pope; that he
&s;hould be appointed vicar of the Roman &s;ee; and that all
the acts pa&s;&s;ed in his pontificate &s;hould be valid. On his
re&s;ignation he &s;ixed his re&s;idence at La Ripaille, and died
in 1451.</P>
<P>FELIX the Fifth has &s;hared the fate of many equivocal
characters. By &s;ome he is repre&s;ented as a &s;aint, by others
as covering the mo&s;t ambitious de&s;igns under the ma&s;k of
&s;anctity; by the former, his re&s;idence at La Ripaille is
<PB N="400" REF="427">
de&s;cribed as the retreat of religious au&s;terity; by the latter,
as the &s;eat of luxury. In this, as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, both
parties &s;eem to have exceeded the truth. On reviewing the
principal events of his life, we may conclude, that a pa|lace
built by a &s;overeign prince, in which he was accom|panied
by many lords of his court, where he in&s;tituted an
order of knighthood, and where he re&s;ided with the pomp
and dignity of a &s;overeign pontiff, could be no common
<HI>hermitage;</HI> and that he a&s;&s;umed the name, rather than
pa&s;&s;ed the life, of a <HI>hermit;</HI> while the power and rank
which he &s;ecured to him&s;elf, on his re&s;ignation of the papa|cy,
&s;ufficiently demon&s;trate, that he never intended to re|nounce
the world. On the contrary, &s;hould we admit, that
his life at La Ripaille was not embittered by penance and
mortifications; yet as no contemporary authors, even tho&s;e
who were by no means partial to his character, have &s;tigma|ti&s;ed
his retirement, we ought not ha&s;tily to conclude, that it
was the retreat of a mere voluptuary. But in whatever
light his moral qualities may be con&s;idered, no one can
withhold from him the character of an able politician.</P>
<P>IT is not my intention to enter into a general or particu|lar
de&s;cription of the Roman antiquities, which have been
found in Switzerland; if you are curious in re&s;earches of
that &s;ort, I mu&s;t refer you to Bochart, Miller, Spon, and
other antiquarians, who have treated minutely of that &s;ub|ject.
I cannot, however, avoid mentioning two lately|di&s;covered
Roman monuments, which are placed in the
garden of Mr. Levade, near the church at Lau&s;anne. The
fir&s;t is an altar of white marble with red veins, and was
<PB N="401" REF="428">
found, in 1782, by &s;ome workmen in digging the founda|tions
of a hou&s;e in the town of Vevay. It is broken in a
horizontal direction; and what remains is a foot and a half
long and a foot high. The in&s;cription, though not entire,
proves it to be an altar erected by the twentieth legion to the
god Silvanus.</P>
<Q>DEO SILVANO

DIC</Q>
<P>THE &s;econd monument is a Roman mile-&s;tone, which
was di&s;covered in a vineyard near Pauda, a few paces from
the high road. It bears the following in&s;cription:</P>
<Q>Imp.
Caes T. Ae. Avg
Antonino
Pio $ PM. Krib&mdash;
Cos. III. P. P.
Avent: M. P. T.

<P>THIS in&s;cription a&s;certains a fact long unknown to the
Swi&s;s antiquarians. Bochart, among others, expre&s;&s;es his
&s;urpri&s;e, that no in&s;cription, bearing the name Antoninus
Pius, who was &s;o great a benefactor to the antient Helve|tians,
has been as yet found in Switzerland. But this mile|&s;tone,
which was put up in the third con&s;ul&s;hip of that em|peror,
<PB N="402" REF="429">
proves the exi&s;tence of &s;uch an in&s;cription; and is
probably the prelude to the di&s;covery of other monuments
erected in his honour.</P>
<P>THE road from Lau&s;anne to Vevay, runs along the &s;ides
of the mountains, between continued ranges of vineyards.
The indu&s;try of the Swi&s;s is no where more ob&s;ervable than
in the&s;e parts: the mountains in many places, though natu|rally
con&s;i&s;ting of a bare &s;teep rock, are thickly covered
with vines. The mould has been brought from other
grounds, in order to create a &s;oil, and is &s;upported by rows
of &s;tones ranged in &s;trait lines like walls. But this mode of
culture, however advantageous, and even nece&s;&s;ary to the
natives, occa&s;ions a di&s;agreeable uniformity in the face of
the country. The vines al&s;o do not form a plea&s;ing and pic|ture&s;que
appearance, like tho&s;e of the Valteline<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Vol. ii.</NOTE>, which
are carried in beautiful fe&s;toons from tree to tree. The plants
are low, and fa&s;tened to poles about four feet in height; and
the high walls which enclo&s;e them, and border the road,
frequently interrupt the view. This di&s;trict between Lau|&s;anne
and Vevay is called <HI>La Vaux,</HI> and contains the two plea|&s;ant
little towns of Lutry and Cully; and the villages of St.
Saphorin<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the church of St. Saphorin, is an antient Roman mile-&s;tone, found near that village, with the following in&s;cription:

This in&s;cription a&s;certains two circum|&s;tances, which have been frequently called in que&s;tion; namely, that the banks of the lake of Geneva, which border this part of Switzerland, were comprized within a Roman province, even &s;o early as the time of Claudius; and al&s;o, that <HI>Aventi$um</HI> was the chief town of this part of Helvetia: for, the mile-&s;tones always referred to the capital town of the province in which they were placed. From St. Saphorin to <HI>Avenches</HI> is exactly 37,000 paces; which an&s;wer to the 37th mile-&s;tone.</NOTE> and Cor&s;ier: it is entirely hilly, ri&s;ing abruptly
<PB N="403" REF="430">
from the lake. Above the vineyards, are rich meadows, and
a continued fore&s;t.</P>
<P>VEVAY, the antient <HI>Vibi&s;cum,</HI> is the principal town of
the bailliage of that name: it is clean and well built, &s;tands
in a &s;mall plain at the foot of the mountains on the edge of
the water, and is one of the few towns in the canton of
Berne which carry on any trade. The borders of this part of
the lake are much more contra&s;ted, wild, and picture&s;que, than
tho&s;e about Geneva: the mountains of the Vallais and Savoy
boldly project into the water, and form a &s;emicircular chain
that enclo&s;es the lake, except where they are divided by the
Rhone; which flows into it a few leagues from Vevay.</P>
<P>VEVAY is di&s;tingui&s;hed as being the re&s;idence of Edmund
Ludlow, the famous parliamentary general, who&s;e name
&s;tands foremo&s;t among the few per&s;ons, who, in tho&s;e times
of mi&s;rule and confu&s;ion, uniformly acted with con&s;i&s;tency
and dignity. True to his republican principles, he no le&s;s
violently oppo&s;ed the daring u&s;urpation of Cromwell, than
the arbitrary mea&s;ures of Charles the Fir&s;t; and could never
be prevailed upon, either by threats or promi&s;es, to de&s;ert
the cau&s;e, which he con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and
liberty. Being excepted, as one of the king's judges, from
<PB N="404" REF="431">
the act of indemnity pa&s;&s;ed at the re&s;toration of Charles the
Second, he wandered, without any fixed place of re&s;idence,
until he found an a&s;ylum from the ba&s;e attempts of his ene|mies
at Vevay, under the protection of Berne.</P>
<P>AT the important period of the revolution, he returned
to England, anxious to &s;erve his country under our great de|liverer;
and William the Third, who&s;e mind ro&s;e &s;uperior to
the narrow prejudices of party, was no le&s;s de&s;irous to em|ploy
a general of &s;uch approved experience and fidelity.
But the king being addre&s;&s;ed by the Hou&s;e of Commons to
i&s;&s;ue a proclamation for apprehending Ludlow, at the
moment his maje&s;ty was going to employ him; he was ac|cordingly
compelled to quit England at this critical period,
and again &s;ettled at Vevay. We may collect from his ge|neral
character and conduct, that if he had been permitted to
&s;erve his country, he would have &s;ucce&s;sfully employed his
great military talents again&s;t the a&s;&s;ertors of bigotry and
de&s;poti&s;m; and with the &s;ame zeal, which he had di&s;played
in oppo&s;ing an arbitrary government, would have &s;upported
the new admini&s;tration; when the enormous prerogatives of
the crown, again&s;t which he had un&s;heathed his &s;word,
were aboli&s;hed by law; and the freedom of the &s;ubject was
e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ba&s;is of equal liberty under the authority
of a limited monarch. He died in 1693, in the &s;ixty-fourth
year of his age; and was interred in the church of Vevay.
His monument is a plain grave-&s;tone of black marble, con|taining
a Latin in&s;cription, which is printed in Addi&s;on's
Travels. The hou&s;e which he formerly inhabited &s;tands
near the gate leading to the Vallais, and the following motto is
<PB N="405" REF="432">
in&s;cribed over the door, which is &s;till pre&s;erved out of re&s;pect
to his memory. <HI>Omne &s;olum forti patria e&s;t, quia patris.</HI></P>
<P>THE Memoirs of Ludlow are written in a &s;imple and per|&s;picuous
&s;tile; with the fidelity of a man who was actually
engaged in the &s;cenes which he de&s;cribes, and with the &s;pirit
of a general zealous in the cau&s;e which he had e&s;pou&s;ed and
defended. Perhaps his animated detail of the trial and exe|cution
of the Regicides, is &s;carcely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any narrative
in antient or modern hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>NATURE can &s;carcely form a po&s;ition more delightful
than that of Chatillard or Clarens. It &s;tands, not far from
Vevay, above the village of Clarens, on an eminence, who&s;e
gentle declivity &s;lopes gradually towards the lake: it com|mands
a view of that maje&s;tic body of water, its fertile
borders, and the bold rocks and alps of Savoy. The ad|jacent
&s;cenery con&s;i&s;ts of vineyards, fields of corn and
pa&s;ture, and rich groves of oak, a&s;h, and Spani&s;h che&s;nut|trees.
Although the &s;ituation and environs harmonize with
the animated &s;cenery in the Eloi&s;e of Rou&s;&s;eau, yet the ca&s;tle
by no means accords with the de&s;cription in the &s;ame work.
The traveller &s;ees an oblong building with antient towers
and a penthou&s;e roof; in the in&s;ide a large hall that looks
like a pri&s;on; and the whole bears rather the antiquated ap|pearance
of a feudal man&s;ion inhabited by &s;ome turbulent
baron, than the re&s;idence of the elegant and impa&s;&s;ioned
Julie.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to Clarens, on the other &s;hore of the lake, are
the dark gloomy rocks of Meillerie. That village lies in the
<PB N="406" REF="433">
rece&s;s of a &s;mall bay, at the foot of impending mountains,
in &s;ome parts gently &s;loping, and clothed to the water's edge
with dark fore&s;ts; in others naked and perpendicular,
bringing to recollection the fancied rocks of Leucate<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Je n'ai plus qu'un mot &agrave; vous dire, &ocirc; Julie. Vous connoi&s;&s;ez l'antique u&s;age du <HI>rocher de Leucate,</HI> dernier re&s;uge des amans malheureux. Ce lieu-ci lui re&s;&s;em|ble &agrave; bien des &eacute;gards.

The&s;e are the &s;cenes of the Nouvelle Eloi&s;e. Having ob|tained
that novel at a circulating library in Lau&s;anne, I con|tinued,
during the&s;e expeditions, to examine the po&s;ition of
the country, and compare it with the de&s;criptions of
Rou&s;&s;eau. Small objects may be magnified; but no pencil,
however animated, can delineate the wonderful and &s;ublime
works of nature; even the warm colouring of Rou&s;&s;eau has
not equalled the beauty of the &s;ituations. I read with at|tention
the principal parts of that &s;ingular performance;
and having now the &s;cenery before me, I dwelt more par|ticularly
upon that letter, in which St. Preux relates his ex|pedition
to Meillerie; wherein love and de&s;pair are worked
up almo&s;t to madne&s;s. Open that performance, read that
letter, and con&s;ider that part of it, where St. Preux points
out the number of towns and villages, the continued fertility
and high cultivation of the Pays de Vaud, and contra&s;ts it
with the gloomy coa&s;t of Chablais, exhibiting only a few
towns lying on the edge of the water; you will then &s;ee the
happy and &s;uperior effects of liberty under a mild and equi|table
government, like that of Berne.</P>

<P>TRAVELLERS not unu&s;ually make an agreeable
excur&s;ion from Vevay to the &s;alt-works of Bex and
Aigle.</P>
<P>THE road continues along a plain, with hills on one &s;ide,
and the lake on the other. Haller's judicious di&s;tinction
of the elevated part of this country, may from this &s;pot
be well exemplified. The rocky alps are &s;een with their
pyramidal tops &s;hooting into the heavens, and incru&s;ted with
eternal ice and &s;now. Snow likewi&s;e, at various intervals,
covers the &s;teep &s;lopes beneath the a&s;piring peaks; rich
pa&s;turage &s;ucceeds; and the bottoms are verdant with fore&s;ts
of firs. The mountains, &s;uch as the Jura and tho&s;e ri&s;ing
towards Denis and Gruyeres, are fertile in gra&s;s, well wooded,
their tops even, exten&s;ive and arable; and though with little
appearance of rock on the &s;urface, yet internally filled with
a hard yellowi&s;h &s;tone fit for building, but impatient of the
chi&s;&s;el. The <HI>collines,</HI> or little hills, are frequent at the foot
of the mountains, and &s;eparated by little vallies watered by
&s;mall brooks.</P>
<P>THE further I advanced, the nearer the mountains ap|proached
the lake; their nature changed, their height in|crea&s;ed,
and their craggy tops and wooded &s;ides convinced
me, that I was approaching the genuine alps. Above the
woods &s;oared, in a mo&s;t picture&s;que manner, a lofty pyra|midal
<PB N="408" REF="435">
crag called <HI>Le Dent de Jamant.</HI> The woods were
firs mixed with oak. The road lay clo&s;e to the water's edge.
The ca&s;tle of Chillon, or rather the ca&s;tellated hou&s;e, a large
pile with round and &s;quare towers; &s;tands on a rock in the
lake, and is connected to the land by a draw-bridge. The
vaults are very fine; the arched roofs and the pillars which
&s;upport it, are in a neat gothic &s;tile. This ca&s;tle, in 1536,
was wre&s;ted from Charles the Third of Savoy by the canton
of Berne, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Genevans, who furni&s;hed a frigate
(their naval force) to be&s;iege it by water. In a deep dun|geon,
below the level of the lake, the conquerors found
Bonivard, prior of St. Victor, the intrepid antagoni&s;t of the
dukes of Savoy, and the great a&s;&s;ertor of Genevan indepen|dence.
He had been impri&s;oned by the Savoyards during
&s;ix years; and, by con&s;tant walking in his &s;hort limits, had
worn a hollow in the rock. This ca&s;tle was for a &s;hort time
the re&s;idence of a bailif from Berne, until a more convenient
hou&s;e was purcha&s;ed for that officer in Vevay. About half
a league further is Villeneuve, a &s;mall town at the extremity
of the lake. I travelled along the concave &s;ide of this mag|nificent
piece of water from Geneva to Villeneuve fifty-four
miles. It is in the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent; Switzerland forms the
hollow; Savoy the convex part; its greate&s;t breadth is from
St. Sulpice to Grande Rive, where it is twelve miles wide.
Savoy affords a rude an awful boundary of a&s;piring alps,
craggy and covered with the ice of ages. The country from
Geneva to the environs of Lau&s;anne, &s;lopes for a con&s;iderable
way to the margin of the lake, and is enriched with all the
varieties which nature can be&s;tow. The long ridge of
the Jura, fertile in pa&s;turage, and varied with woods, backs
this beautiful tract. Near Lau&s;anne the banks ri&s;e very con|&s;iderably,
<PB REF="436">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="409" REF="437">
and form a mo&s;t charming terrace. A few miles
beyond Lau&s;anne is a rapid de&s;cent. Near Vevay begins
a plain, which is continued far beyond the end of the lake,
but contracting, by the approach of the mountains, towards
the water. The colour of the water is extremely beautiful,
clear, and at a di&s;tance &s;eems of a mo&s;t lovely blue.</P>
<P>NEAR Geneva the coa&s;t abounds in &s;mall pebbles covered
with a brown incru&s;tation. From Geneva as far as Lau|&s;anne
the &s;hores are &s;andy; but from Lau&s;anne to Chillon
appear ledges of rocks hard and calcareous: the extremity
of the lake is a mar&s;h formed by the collected mud of the
Rhone. The depth is various. M. de Luc a&s;&s;erts, that on
&s;ounding it he had found the greate&s;t depth to be a hundred
and &s;ixty fathoms: like all inland lakes enclo&s;ed within high
mountains, it is &s;ubject to &s;udden &s;torms.</P>
<P>I AM uncertain whether any birds frequent the lake
which are not common to the re&s;t of Switzerland. The
tippet grebes<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pennant's Brit. Zool. vol. ii. No. 222.</NOTE> appear here in December and retire in Fe|bruary.
The &s;kins are an elegant article of luxury, and &s;ell
for about twelve or fourteen &s;hillings each. The&s;e birds are
obliged to breed in other places, this lake being almo&s;t
totally de&s;titute of reeds and ru&s;hes, in which they form
their floating ne&s;t. From Villeneuve the road runs through
a beautiful valley, con&s;i&s;ting of the riche&s;t meadow and corn
land, very populous and &s;inely wooded, and expanding to
the breadth of four miles. The alps bound each &s;ide, with
<PB N="410" REF="438">
tops broken into va&s;t crags of various forms. I pa&s;&s;ed near
La Roche, where a director of the &s;alt-works is deputed by
the government of Berne; and which is rendered memo|rable
by the re&s;idence of Haller, who filled that office from
1758 to 1766. During his retirement in this place, that
di&s;tingui&s;hed man prepared for public in&s;pection many of
his numerous publications, and particularly his immortal
work on phy&s;iology.</P>
<P>I LEFT at a little di&s;tance Yvorne, ruined, in 1584, by the
fall of a mountain occa&s;ioned by an earthquake; cro&s;&s;ed the
torrent called La Grande Eau, and halted at Aigle, a good
town, &s;eated at the &s;eet of &s;ome &s;mall round hills prettily
covered with firs. This country was conquered from the
Savoyards by Berne in 1475, and was made a di&s;tinct govern|ment
con&s;i&s;ting of four <HI>Mandemens.</HI> The governor re&s;ides
at Aigle. It formerly had its particular heads, the family of
Torrens; but the la&s;t count formally re&s;igned his preten&s;ions
at Berne in 1553. This government of Aigle reaches to the
Pays de Vaud; and, when under the dominion of the hou&s;e
of Savoy, was compri&s;ed within that di&s;trict; at pre&s;ent it is
cla&s;&s;ed under the German divi&s;ion of that canton, although
French is the language of the natives. Further on the val|ley
is greatly contracted, and &s;o filled with trees as to appear
a great fore&s;t. The laburnum abounds here in a wild &s;tate.
The wood is beautifully veined, of great &s;trength, and much
u&s;ed for wedges aud mu&s;ical in&s;truments. The variety with
&s;hort &s;pikes of flowers has the mo&s;t elegant veins, and is cal|led
the <HI>ebony</HI> of the Alps: Pliny &s;ays its wood is the harde&s;t
next to the ebony. The cornelian cherry is common in the
<PB N="411" REF="439">
hedges, and the fruit is frequently pre&s;erved with &s;ugar. The
<HI>Machaleb</HI> cherry, or <HI>Prunus Machaleb,</HI> is to be found in the&s;e
parts; the wood is red, of fine &s;cent, and in reque&s;t for
handles of knives; it is known among cutlers by the name of
<HI>Bois de St. Lucie.</HI> A plea&s;ant &s;cented water is di&s;tilled from
this tree; and the &s;eeds are u&s;ed to give a fragrancy to &s;oap.
Between Aigle and Bex is a mo&s;t picture&s;que view of the
ca&s;tle of St. Tryphon, on the &s;ummit of a lofty in&s;ulated
rock in the middle of the plain; it is &s;urrounded with wood,
and reali&s;es Milton's de&s;cription of an antient ca&s;tle,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Bo&s;om'd high in tufted trees.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>I am informed it is built of marble, which is no wonder, as a
beautiful black &s;pecies is found very near. St. Tryphon
was a Phrygian, who is &s;aid to have &s;uffered martyrdom at
Nice in 251, at the time of the per&s;ecution under the em|peror
Decius.</P>
<P>BEX is a &s;mall town at the foot of the mountains, five
miles from the &s;alt-works at Bevieux. Between Bex and
Bevieux, I ob&s;erved the larch in great plenty. Painters,
from the time of Pliny to that of Raphael, tru&s;ted their
works to this wood, which the Roman naturali&s;t &s;tiles <HI>im|mortale
lignum.</HI> The wood is reckoned excellent for all works
which are to lie under water; and the borderers on the lake of
Geneva prefer it for building their ve&s;&s;els. In the&s;e parts I
&s;aw mo&s;t beautiful woods of che&s;nut. Haller &s;ays that they
extend &s;ome leagues; he al&s;o informs us, that they are found
in other parts of Switzerland, and even in de&s;ert places in
<PB N="412" REF="440">
&s;ome of the tran&s;alpine parts; accident mu&s;t have brought
them thither, as it appears from Pliny, that the&s;e trees were
fir&s;t introduced into Europe from Sardis.</P>
<P>UPON our arrival at the &s;alt-&s;prings, I put on a work|man's
jacket, and went into the mountain about 3,000 feet
almo&s;t horizontally. The gallery is about &s;ix feet high, and
four broad, and is as nicely hollowed as if it had been cut
with a chi&s;&s;el: it is hewn in a black rock, veined in &s;ome
places with white gyp&s;um. The &s;alt is procured from
&s;ome &s;prings, which are found within a &s;olid rock, perfo|rated
at a great expence: the riche&s;t &s;ource yields twenty-eight
pounds of &s;alt <HI>per cent.</HI> and the poore&s;t but half a
pound in the &s;ame quantity. Near the&s;e &s;prings are &s;e|veral
warm &s;ources, &s;trongly impregnated with &s;ulphur;
&s;ome of which contain a mixture of &s;alt, and will flame
when a lighted candle is put into the pipe through which
they flow. No &s;olid &s;alt, excepting a few &s;mall cubes, has
been yet di&s;covered; but the mountain is replete with
particles. Rocks of white gyp&s;um or alaba&s;ter, mixed with
blui&s;h clay, are common near the &s;prings, in the &s;ame
manner as may be ob&s;erved in the pits of Northwich,
in Che&s;hire.</P>
<P>AFTER travelling in this &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age near
three quarters of a mile, I ob&s;erved a great wheel of thirty-five
feet diameter, which &s;erves to rai&s;e the brine from the
depth of about &s;eventy feet. From this place is a &s;haft three
hundred feet high, which is cut through the mountain to
the &s;urface, for the purpo&s;e of introducing fre&s;h air. I no|ticed
<PB N="413" REF="441">
two re&s;ervoirs hollowed in the &s;olid rock for holding
the brine; one whereof was a hundred and &s;ixty feet &s;quare,
and nine in depth. Since my fir&s;t expedition to the&s;e pits
in 1776, the workmen had pierced the rock twenty-five feet
deeper, and cut a gallery a hundred feet in length. They
had al&s;o began to form a third re&s;ervoir, which is to contain
5,500 cubic feet; and of this nearly half was fini&s;hed. The
brine depo&s;ited in the&s;e re&s;ervoirs is conveyed, by means of
two thou&s;and pipes, about a league to Bevieux, where the &s;alt
is extracted. The brine pits near Aigle contain only from
two to one-half <HI>per cent.;</HI> and yield annually about a third
as much as tho&s;e of Bevieux, or about 5,000 quintals. The
&s;alt is much whiter and heavier than that of Bevieux, and
con&s;equently bears a higher price.</P>
<P>THESE, which are the only &s;alt-works in Switzerland,
&s;carcely yield a neat yearly profit of more than &pound;. 3,000;
and furni&s;h only one-twelfth of the annual con&s;umption in
the canton. The remainder is procured chiefly from France,
which is obliged by treaty to provide the Swi&s;s &s;tates with
this commodity at a moderate price: and indeed &s;o high is
the tax upon &s;alt in that kingdom, that even the French
&s;alt is &s;old two-thirds cheaper in Switzerland, than in many
parts of France<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At Paris, where it is the deare&s;t, a pound of &s;alt is &s;old for about 13 &s;ols, or about &s;ix-pence of our money: in &s;ome other parts of France, for in&s;tance in Franche Comt&eacute;, a pound co&s;ts only 4 or 5 &s;ols; but it is furni&s;hed to the Swi&s;s at the rate of 2 1/2 &s;ols.</NOTE>. The ordinary price of common &s;alt
throughout the canton, is at the rate of three-half-pence
per pound.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY AND LAKE OF JOUX&mdash;ORBE&mdash;ST. BAR|THELEMI&mdash;YVERDUN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Yverdun, <DATE>Sept. 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE chain of mountains called the <HI>Jura,</HI> begins in the
canton of Zuric, extends along the Rhine, into the
canton and bi&s;hopric of Ba&s;le, &s;tretches into the canton of
Soleure and the principality of Neuchatel, branches out to|wards
the Pays de Vaud, &s;eparates that country from
Franche Comt&eacute; and Burgundy, and continues beyond the
frontiers of the Genevois as far as the Rhone. In va|rious
parts of the Pays de Vaud this chain forms many
elevated vallies much vi&s;ited by travellers, among&s;t which,
not the lea&s;t remarkable, is the valley of the lake of Joux,
upon the top of that part of the Jura called Mont Joux;
and which lies in the bailliage of Roman Motier. This
valley contains &s;everal neat and well-peopled villages, and
is beautifully checkered with wood, arable, and pa&s;ture
ground. It is watered by two picture&s;que lakes; the large&s;t
of which is called the lake of Joux. One &s;hore is high rock,
covered with wood; the oppo&s;ite banks form a gentle a&s;cent,
well cultivated and producing grain, backed by an abrupt
ridge adorned with pines, beech, and oak. The &s;maller
lake, called Lac Brenet, is in its &s;hape more oval, and richly
bordered with corn-fields and cottages. The&s;e two lakes
are divided by a narrow neck of land; and over the channel
<PB N="415" REF="443">
or little &s;treight is a wooden bridge of a &s;ingle arch, which
leads to the village of Charbonniers.</P>
<P>NEAR the &s;mall village of Abbaye, a rivulet gu&s;hes from
the bottom of the rock, and lo&s;es it&s;elf in the large&s;t lake. From
the &s;maller lake de&s;cends a &s;tream, which is lo&s;t in a hollow
gulph called <HI>L'Entonnior,</HI> or the Funnel, a name common to
&s;everal others in this place. In this gulph &s;everal mills are
placed, and turned by the force of the current. About two
miles further, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the mountain, the river
Orbe bur&s;ts forth, and is probably produced by the &s;tream here
ingulphed. This little vale is very populous, containing about
three thou&s;and inhabitants, who are remarkably indu&s;trious.
Some make watches, but the greate&s;t part are employed in
poli&s;hing cry&s;tals, granites, and marca&s;ites. In the &s;mall
village of Pont, where we lodged, the greate&s;t part of the in|habitants
bear the &s;urname of Rochat; a name which runs
through the village of Charboniere, with the exception of
only two or three families; and is prevalent likewi&s;e in that
of Abbaye: the whole number of the&s;e Rochats amounts to
above a thou&s;and. I inquired whether, like the Scotti&s;h
clans, they took the appellation from any chief; or whether
they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cendants of the &s;ame family: I
was a&s;&s;ured, that the latter is the fact, and that their ance&s;|tors
came originally from France. The&s;e parts are much in|fe&s;ted
with bears and wolves. In our a&s;cent to this delight|ful
vale, and as we de&s;cended through a variety of hill, val|ley,
wood, and lawn; we had a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect,
comprehending great part of the Pays de Vaud, the lake of
Geneva with its mountainous boundary, and that of Neucha|tel.
<PB N="416" REF="444">
The&s;e two lakes appear, from that high point of view,
to be nearly upon the &s;ame level<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. de Luc, the lake of Neuchatel is 159 French feet above that of Geneva.</NOTE>, with no con&s;iderable &s;well
of the country intervening.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;&s;ed through a beautiful and picture&s;que country
from Romain Motier to Orbe; which, according to anti|quarians,
was the mo&s;t antient town, and once the mo&s;t
powerful, of all Helvetia. It was called <HI>Urba,</HI> and was the
capital of the <HI>Pagus Urbigenus:</HI> no remains however exi&s;t
at pre&s;ent of its antient &s;plendour. Some antique fortifica|tions,
an old ca&s;tle, and a round tower, are works probably
of later and more turbulent times; erected, perhaps, when
this country was divided into a number of feudal &s;overeign|ties.
I am greatly plea&s;ed with the romantic &s;ituation of this
town, the boldne&s;s of the &s;ingle-arched bridge projecting
over the Orbe, the wild &s;cenery on the banks of that river,
its frequent cataracts, and with various picture&s;que views in
the environs.</P>
<P>MR. VENEL, an eminent &s;urgeon of this town, has form|ed,
under the protection of the government of Berne, an
e&s;tabli&s;hment which well de&s;erves the attention of the hu|mane
and curious traveller. It is an infirmary for the re|ception
of tho&s;e objects, who are born with di&s;torted limbs,
or have by accident acquired that misfortune. The children
are lodged and boarded in the hou&s;e, under the care of his
a&s;&s;i&s;tant, who charges him&s;elf with all the detail of hou&s;e|keeping,
<PB N="417" REF="445">
and of in&s;tructing tho&s;e, who&s;e age renders it re|qui&s;ite,
that their education &s;hould not be neglected. Mr.
Venel's &s;kill in improving and &s;implifying tho&s;e machines
nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;e, has been &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted by
various cures.</P>
<P>THOUGH he chiefly confines his attempts to infants and
children, yet he has performed &s;everal cures on adult per|&s;ons.
His mo&s;t efficacious remedy is a machine which he
has invented to embrace the patient's limbs when in bed,
and which is &s;o contrived as to act without di&s;turbing their
re&s;t. Ingenious as his method is, yet he acknowledges, that
much of his &s;ucce&s;s depends on the mild treatment of the
patients, and on having them continually under his in&s;pec|tion.
I was convinced indeed of the mildne&s;s of his treat|ment,
by ob&s;erving &s;everal of the&s;e children, from four to
ten years of age, crawling about the ground, and diverting
them&s;elves with great cheerfulne&s;s, although ca&s;ed up in
their machinery. It may not perhaps be unworthy of re|mark,
that Mr. Venel, on the admi&s;&s;ion of a mi&s;erable object,
takes in plai&s;ter of Paris the mold of the di&s;torted limbs, in
order to demon&s;trate the change that takes place. Such an
e&s;tabli&s;hment redounds highly to the honour of Mr. Venel,
and the government who protects it, and is worthy of imi|tation
in all countries.</P>
<P>ORBE, which is governed by its own magi&s;trates, is com|pri&s;ed
within the bailliage of Echalens, belonging to Berne
and Friburgh: the&s;e two cantons alternately &s;end a bailif,
who re&s;ides at Echalens, and remains in office during five
<PB N="418" REF="446">
years. When Berne appoints the bailif, an appeal lies from
his deci&s;ions to the &s;overeign council of Friburgh; and to
the government of Berne, when he is nominated by Fri|burgh.
By the&s;e means a great check is laid upon the ex|actions
of the bailif: and I am informed, that ju&s;tice is no
where more equally admini&s;tered than in the&s;e common
bailliages of the two cantons.</P>
<P>PERHAPS one of the mo&s;t beautiful and fine&s;t po&s;itions in
Switzerland is the ca&s;tle of St. Barthelemi, the &s;eat of Count
d'Affry, colonel of the Swi&s;s guards; and now inhabited by
his &s;on, count Louis d'Affry, to whom I was indebted for a
mo&s;t kind and friendly reception. This antient family-&s;eat
&s;tands on an eminence in the bailliage of Echalens, about
three miles from Orbe, near the high road which leads from
Lau&s;anne to Yverdun. The &s;ides of the eminence are fea|thered
with wood; and below are rich fields and meadows
of the fine&s;t verdure, watered by two lively torrents which
unite and form the Falun. Upon the high road, the count
has reared an obeli&s;k, on which he has in&s;cribed, in the
true &s;pirit of toleration and forbearance, the following words,
&startq;<HI>Prai&s;e God, all ye nations,</HI>&endq; in the Engli&s;h, Latin, French,
and German languages.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle commands a pro&s;pect of a mo&s;t fertile and
well-wooded country, gently broken into hill and dale; on
one &s;ide appears a di&s;tant view of the Jura and the hills of
Burgundy and Franche Comt&eacute;; and, on the other, the
horizon is bounded by the rugged alps in the canton of
Berne and in the Vallais, by Mount Velain, the highe&s;t point
<PB N="419" REF="447">
of St. Bernard and Mont Blanc, who&s;e &s;uperior elevation
above the &s;urrounding heights is &s;uch, that its &s;ummit reflects
the rays of the ri&s;ing &s;un &s;everal minutes &s;ooner, and retains
tho&s;e of the &s;etting &s;un &s;everal minutes later than any of the
circumjacent mountains.</P>
<P>FROM St. Barthelemi we de&s;cended into the plain, which
&s;tretches to the lake of Yverdun. This plain was formerly
covered as far as Entreroches (three leagues from its pre&s;ent
po&s;ition) and probably further, by that lake: it is now, for
a con&s;iderable part, a great &s;wamp. Within a quarter of a
mile of the town, are warm baths which are &s;trongly &s;ulphu|reous,
and much frequented during the &s;ummer months.
Yverdun is large, airy, and well-built with &s;tone, like the
towns in the Pays de Vaud; it &s;tands near the lake, in a &s;mall
i&s;land formed by the two branches of the river Thiele. Be|tween
the town and the lake there is a plea&s;ant lawn extend|ing
to the water, and planted with avenues of lime-trees.
Yverdun carries on &s;carcely any trade, and its principal &s;up|port
ari&s;es from the pa&s;&s;age of the merchandi&s;e between Pied|mont
and Germany. This town is celebrated for its print|ing-pre&s;s,
e&s;tabli&s;hed in the beginning of the pre&s;ent cen|tury;
but entirely neglected until, &s;ome years ago, it was
renewed by <HI>Felice,</HI> a Neapolitan of learning and abilities.</P>
<P>THE lake of Yverdun, or of Neuchatel, &s;tretches from
&s;outh to north about twenty miles in length, and in &s;ome
places about five in breadth. Its &s;hores near Yverdun are
covered with country-hou&s;es. It is &s;omewhat extraordinary,
that the dull and ta&s;tele&s;s uniformity of the French gardens
<PB N="420" REF="448">
&s;hould have been adopted by the Swi&s;s, who&s;e country
abounds with noble and picture&s;que &s;ituations, and where
nature wantons in the mo&s;t luxuriant varieyt. I have fre|quently
ob&s;erved, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t romantic &s;cenes, a
maje&s;tic fore&s;t &s;liced into regular alleys; and at the very
borders of the fine&s;t lakes, artificial pools of water edged
with &s;un-burnt parterres. Should any per&s;on, in this, accu&s;e
me of national prejudice, let me exclaim with Voltaire, who
certainly cannot be convicted of partiality to the Engli&s;h:</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GRANSON&mdash;NEUCHATEL&mdash;MR. PURY'S BENE|FACTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;kirted the we&s;t &s;ide of the lake of Neuchatel
through Gran&s;on, the principal town of a bailliage
of that name, belonging to Berne and Friburgh, and re|markable
for the battle in which Charles the Bold, duke of
Burgundy, was defeated by the Swi&s;s in 1476. We entered
the principality of Neuchatel about &s;ix miles from that
town, and pa&s;&s;ed through St. Aubin, Boudri, Colombier,
lying plea&s;antly upon the borders of the water. The road
runs along the &s;ide of the Jura, through a country that re|&s;embled,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the di&s;trict of La Vaux, between
Lau&s;anne and Vevay: the &s;ides of the Jura are almo&s;t the
whole way covered with vines, &s;upported in many parts by
low &s;tone-walls. The borders of this lake are more uniform
than tho&s;e of the lake of Geneva; and do not ri&s;e into &s;uch
high, irregular, and grote&s;que alps as the coa&s;t of Chablais.
Towards Gran&s;on and St. Aubin, the country is more diver|&s;ified
with meadows and corn-fields; nearer to Neuchatel,
the &s;ummits of the mountains are clothed with fore&s;t, and
the midland and lower parts entirely planted with vines. Be|tween
the lake and the Jura &s;everal rivers bur&s;t from the
rock in con&s;iderable &s;treams; and, after turning &s;everal
mills, fall into the lake at a little di&s;tance from their &s;ource.
The large&s;t is that of La S$rriere, near a &s;mall village of the
<PB N="422" REF="450">
&s;ame name, which we cro&s;&s;ed in our way to Colombier, where
we dined with a family who&s;e acquaintance we had formed at
the baths of Leuk. We pa&s;&s;ed a very agreeable day with
the&s;e amiable per&s;ons; by whom we were received with
that frankne&s;s and unaffected ea&s;e which characteri&s;es true
politene&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner &s;ome mu&s;icians of the country performed
the <HI>Renz des vaches:</HI> that famous air which was forbidden
to be played among the Swi&s;s troops in the French &s;ervice;
as it awakened in the &s;oldiers &s;uch a longing recollection of
their native country, that it often produced in them a &s;ettled
melancholy, and occa&s;ioned frequent de&s;ertion. The French
call this &s;pecies of patriotic regret, <HI>la maladie du pays.</HI> There
is nothing peculiarly &s;triking in the tune; but, as it is com|po&s;ed
of the mo&s;t &s;imple notes, the powerful effect of its me|lody
upon the Swi&s;s &s;oldiers, in a foreign land, is the le&s;s
&s;urpri&s;ing. Nothing indeed revives &s;o lively a remembrance
of former &s;cenes, as a piece of favourite mu&s;ic which we
were accu&s;tomed to hear amid our earlie&s;t and deare&s;t connec|tions:
upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, a long train of a&s;&s;ociated ideas
will nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e in the mind, and, if not totally &s;elfi&s;h, melt
it into tenderne&s;s. To u&s;e the language of poetry,</P>
<Q><L>There is in &s;ouls a &s;ympathy with &s;ounds.</L>

<P><PB N="423" REF="451">
IT is ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who inhabit mountainous
countries are mo&s;t &s;ubject to this <HI>maladie du pays,</HI> becau&s;e
their habits of life are e&s;&s;entially different from the cu&s;toms
and manners of other people. Accordingly, the Scotch high-|landers,
and the Bi&s;cayans, as well as the Swi&s;s, when ab&s;ent
from their country, are peculiarly apt to be affected with
every circum&s;tance that recalls it to their minds.</P>
<P>THE town of Neuchatel is &s;mall, and contains about 3,000
&s;ouls. It lies partly upon the little plain between the lake
and the Jura, and partly upon the declivity of that moun|tain:
in con&s;equence of which &s;ituation, &s;ome of its &s;treets
are very &s;teep. At the commencement of the pre&s;ent cen|tury,
commerce was almo&s;t wholly unknown in this town;
as the ridiculous pride of its being deemed degrading, gene|rally
prevailed among the inhabitants. The &s;en&s;ele&s;s preju|dice
is now, however, nearly extingui&s;hed. The chief article
of exportation is wine, produced from the neighbouring
vineyards, and much e&s;teemed. Manufactures al&s;o of print|ed
linens and cottons have been e&s;tabli&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s: and
within the&s;e few years, &s;everal merchants have rai&s;ed large
fortunes.</P>

<OPENER><DATE>Oct. 3, 1786.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE mildne&s;s of the government, and the general well|being
of the inhabitants, are vi&s;ibly demon&s;trated from the
increa&s;e of population among the natives, and the prodigious
<PB N="424" REF="452">
influx of &s;ettlers. The number of &s;ouls in the principality
of Neuchatel and Vallengin being, in 1752, only 28,017 &s;ub|jects,
and 4,318 aliens, amounted, in 1784, to 31,576 &s;ubjects,
and 9,704 aliens, which gives an increa&s;e of near a fourth
part within the &s;pace of thirty-two years. The facility of
acquiring the burgher&s;hip of Neuchatel, has al&s;o prevented
any decrea&s;e of its inhabitants. Thus the magi&s;trates, be|tween
the years 1760 and 1770, admitted forty-one burgh|ers;
from 1770 to 1780, forty-&s;ix; from 1780 to 1785, fifty|one;
in all, a hundred and thirty-eight. Many of the&s;e &s;et|tlers
had children before they purcha&s;ed the burgher&s;hip;
and thirty-eight were foreigners, either German, French, or
Swi&s;s. Several public works and buildings have been lately
executed at Neuchatel, at an expence far exceeding the re|venues,
or even wants of this little &s;tate. Among&s;t others I
&s;hall mention a &s;uperb cau&s;eway leading towards the valley
of St. Imier, an alms-hou&s;e and a town-hou&s;e, which is
built of &s;uch &s;olid materials, as if it was intended to &s;urvive
to the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity, and to rival the duration of the
much-famed Roman capitol<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Capitoli</HI> IMMOBILE <HI>&s;axum.</HI> Virgil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE per&s;on, to whom the burghers of Neuchatel princi|pally
owe the embelli&s;hment of their town, is Mr. David
Pury, late banker of the court at Li&s;bon. He was a citizen
of Neuchatel, and was born in 1709: his father was mayor
of Lignieres, afterwards colonel and ju&s;tice of peace in South-Carolina,
and founder of Puri&s;burgh. Having received his
education in his native town, he quitted it, as &s;ome &s;ay, in
<PB N="425" REF="453">
great poverty, and repaired to Geneva, where he pa&s;&s;ed his
apprentice&s;hip, but in what hou&s;e, or in what trade, the
per&s;on, who obligingly furni&s;hed me with the&s;e anecdotes,
does not mention. From Geneva he went to London, and
acted as one of the clerks to an eminent jeweller, where he
acquired a great &s;kill for e&s;timating at &s;ight the value of
diamonds. After a long re&s;idence in England, he e&s;tabli&s;hed
him&s;elf in Li&s;bon, and carried on a very exten&s;ive com|merce,
particularly in brazil-wood and precious &s;tones.
Being appointed court-banker, he rapidly increa&s;ed his for|tune.
This generous man, however, did not, with a par&s;i|mony
not unu&s;ual in per&s;ons who have enriched them&s;elves
by commerce, con&s;ign his money to his co&s;&s;ers, or &s;paringly
di&s;tribute his large&s;&s;es; on the contrary, while living, he
remitted large &s;ums of money to his native town; and being
unmarried, and having none but di&s;tant relations, left his
country his heir. The following is a li&s;t of the &s;ums which
he gave away, either in charitable donations, or for the im|provement
of Neuchatel.</P>
<P>FROM the year 1771 to 1786, &pound;. 100 annually for the poor
of Neuchatel, and the &s;ame &s;um for tho&s;e of Vallengin,
which, for fifteen years, amounts to &pound;. 3,000. Different
&s;ums at various periods, and for divers u&s;es, to January
1785, amount to &pound;. 15,900. To this mu&s;t be added the pur|cha&s;e
of near 7,000 tickets in the lottery towards rai&s;ing a
fund for building and endowing an ho&s;pital; which tickets
he al&s;o pre&s;ented to the &s;aid ho&s;pital. He died on the 31&s;t of
May 1785; and the remains of his fortune, bequeathed to
his country, after the payment of a few legacies, does not
<PB N="426" REF="454">
fall &s;hort of &pound;. 160,000, which, together with the contribu|tions
in his life-time, render his benefactions equal to al|mo&s;t
&pound;. 200,000. His grateful country obtained from the
king of Pru&s;&s;ia the title of baron in his favour; a title
which, through his &s;ingular mode&s;ty, he neither bore nor
u&s;ed in the &s;ignature of his letters. The citizens of Neu|chatel
have al&s;o placed the portrait of this generous bene|factor
in one of the apartments in which government a&s;|&s;emble;
and have ordered a marble bu&s;t to be executed for
the new town-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THE large legacy which Pury has bequeathed to the
town, being more than &s;ufficient to complete the buildings
and public works, it would well become the wi&s;dom of
government to employ part of the remainder, rather in u&s;e|ful
undertakings, than in the con&s;truction of new edifices,
which are not wanted. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e works, which
regard the health and convenience of the town, it may be
&s;ufficient to hint, that the public walks, which are not much
neglected, might be improved; the &s;treets, which are ex|tremely
dirty, be clean&s;ed; and the torrent, which traver&s;es
the town, and threatens it with frequent inundations, may
be turned. But particularly an ample field is open for the
protection and encouragement of literature; for even in the
e&s;&s;ential article of education this place is &s;o deficient, that
it can &s;carcely be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ingle &s;eminary; con&s;e|quently
the inhabitants, though endowed with lively parts
and good capacities, are much le&s;s informed than tho&s;e of
the other Prote&s;tant towns in Switzerland. A new &s;pirit may
be given to the &s;tudy of the arts and &s;ciences; and the &s;emi|nary
<PB N="427" REF="455">
may be rendered of great public utility by appointing
two or three profe&s;&s;ors for the in&s;truction of youth<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It gives me plea&s;ure to add, that the members of the government of Neuchatel &s;eem worthy of the tru&s;t which has been committed to them. They have clean&s;ed the town, improved and beautified the pub|lic walks; augmented the &s;alaries of the clergy and profe&s;&s;ors, and have in&s;tituted a &s;eminary for the education of youth.</NOTE> Thus
future generations, enlightened by means of this bene|faction,
will repeat with &s;atisfaction the name of Pury;
joining in their grateful commemorations tho&s;e magi&s;trates,
who fir&s;t opened the &s;ources of &s;cience and literature, and
taught them to flow for the improvement of a di&s;tant
po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXPEDITION TO LO$LE AND CHAUX DE FOND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Neuchatel, <DATE>Sept. 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM charmed with an expedition to the &s;ummit of the
Jura; and will give you a &s;hort account of it, while the
impre&s;&s;ion remains warm upon my mind.</P>
<P>THE principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin, &s;tretches
from the lake to the limits of Franche Comt&eacute;; containing
in length, from north to &s;outh, about twelve leagues, and
about &s;ix in its greate&s;t breadth. The di&s;trict of Neuchatel
occupies all the plain, together with the lower parts of the
mountains: while Vallengin is totally enclo&s;ed within the
Jura. Parallel chains of the Jura run from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and
form, in the mo&s;t elevated parts, &s;everal valleys. The lower
grounds of this chain are arable lands and vineyards: the
higher con&s;i&s;t of large tracts of fore&s;t, which in many parts
have been cleared, and converted into con&s;iderable pa&s;|tures,
intermixed with fields of barley and oats. But the
&s;ingular genius and indu&s;try of the numerous inhabitants,
particularly demands the attention of every curious traveller.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Vallengin,</HI> the capital of the di&s;trict
of that name; a &s;mall open burgh, with a modern ca&s;tle
built on &s;ome antient ruins. We then cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Val de Ruz,</HI>
which contains above twenty villages, &s;ituated at the foot of
<PB N="429" REF="457">
the mountains which border the valley: the inhabitants in
general are employed in agriculture, &s;ome few excepted,
who follow occa&s;ionally the mechanical arts. We arrived
about mid-day at La Chaux de Fond, a large hand&s;ome vil|lage
lying in a broad valley which reaches the Franche
Comt&eacute;: from thence we proceeded to Locle, through a con|tinued
range of plea&s;ing cottages, which &s;kirt both &s;ides
of the road; and are &s;cattered likewi&s;e over the country.
As the&s;e two little towns or villages carry on the &s;ame com|merce;
I &s;hall comprehend them both under one common
de&s;cription.</P>
<P>LA Chaux de Fond and Locle, together with the di&s;tricts
belonging to them, may contain about &s;ix thou&s;and inha|bitants,
remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed for their genius, indu&s;try,
and &s;kill in the mechanical arts. They carry on an exten|&s;ive
traffic in lace, &s;tockings, cutlery, and other merchandi&s;e
of their own manufacture: but watch-making, and every
branch of clock-work, are the articles in which they parti|cularly
excel. They not only make every in&s;trument em|ployed
in tho&s;e arts, but have invented &s;everal: and all &s;orts
of workmen nece&s;&s;ary for the completion of that branch of
bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as painters, enamellers, engravers, and gild|ers,
are found in the&s;e villages; where, upon an average,
about forty thou&s;and watches are yearly made. The genius
and indu&s;try, indeed, ob&s;ervable upon the&s;e mountains, ex|hibit
a &s;cene uncommonly plea&s;ing. As every individual is
&s;ure, not only of obtaining a comfortable maintenance for
him&s;elf, but al&s;o of &s;oon placing his children in a way of pro|curing
their own livelihood; the people marry very early.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="458">
NOT many years ago, the greate&s;t part of the&s;e valleys
was almo&s;t one continued fore&s;t; but the wonder-working
powers of indu&s;try have happily changed the &s;cene into flou|ri&s;hing
villages and fertile pa&s;tures. The increa&s;e of popula|tion
will appear from the following fact: Formerly the pro|duce
of the country was more than &s;ufficient for the con&s;ump|tion
of the inhabitants; at pre&s;ent, although con&s;iderably
more cultivated, it &s;carcely furni&s;hes an eighth part of the
provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for interior con&s;umption: the remainder
is drawn from Franche Comt&eacute;. And no wonder; for be&s;ide
the natural effect of their frequent and early marriages;
every &s;tranger who brings a certificate of his good behaviour,
is at liberty to &s;ettle, and to follow any trade without the
lea&s;t re&s;triction. Here, no apprentice&s;hip is nece&s;&s;ary;
nothing is contraband; and indu&s;try exerts her&s;elf untaxed.</P>
<P>BESIDE tho&s;e particular arts I have already mentioned,
&s;everal inhabitants of Locle and La Chaux de Fond are well
&s;killed in other branches of mechanical &s;cience, and have
invented u&s;eful mathematical and a&s;tronomical in&s;truments.
Among tho&s;e who have eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves
in this way, is the famous Jaquet Droz, who is now at Paris;
and who&s;e &s;on exhibited in England &s;everal automatical
figures of a very &s;ingular and &s;urpri&s;ing con&s;truction: one
played upon the harp&s;ichord; another drew land&s;capes;
and, what is &s;till more extraordinary, a third copied any
word pre&s;ented to it, or wrote down whatever was dictated
by any of the company. The&s;e are certainly wonderful in|ventions,
and &s;eem to exalt the powers of mechani&s;m; but
&s;till they are mere toys, and an unworthy wa&s;te of great
<PB N="431" REF="459">
genius: it is Swift making riddles. How much more lauda|bly,
and with equal &s;ucce&s;s, might the &s;ame talents and ap|plication
have been exerted in improving, or adding to,
tho&s;e in&s;truments and apparatus, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the
a&s;tronomer and natural philo&s;opher!</P>
<P>THE origin of watch-making in the&s;e parts, as related
by Mr. O&s;terwald, the hi&s;toriographer of the&s;e mountains, is
extremely curious; and the truth of his account was con|firmed
to me by &s;everal arti&s;ts both of Locle and La Chaux
de Fond. In 1679, one of the inhabitants brought from
London a watch; which being out of order, he entru&s;ted
it to Daniel John Richard, of La Sagne. Richard, after exa|mining
the mechani&s;m with great attention, determined to
attempt making a watch from the model before him: but
to this end he was de&s;titute of every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the
powers of his own native genius. Accordingly he employed
a whole year in inventing and fini&s;hing the &s;everal in&s;tru|ments
previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;e; and in &s;ix
months from that period (by the &s;ole force of his own pe|netrating
and per&s;evering talents) he produced a complete
watch. But his ambition and indu&s;try did not &s;top here:
be&s;ide applying him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully to the invention of
&s;everal new in&s;truments u&s;eful for the perfection of his
work, he took a journey to Geneva, where he gained con|&s;iderable
information in the art. He continued for &s;ome
time the only watchmaker in the&s;e parts; but bu&s;ine&s;s in|crea&s;ing,
he in&s;tructed &s;everal a&s;&s;ociates; by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance
he was enabled to &s;upply from his &s;ingle &s;hop all the de|mands
of the neighbouring country. Towards the beginning
<PB N="432" REF="460">
of the pre&s;ent century he removed to Locle, where he died
in 1741, leaving five &s;ons, who followed their father's occu|pation.
The knowledge and practice of the art gradually
&s;pread it&s;elf, is now become almo&s;t the univer&s;al bu&s;ine&s;s of
the inhabitants, and may be deemed the principal cau&s;e of
the population ob&s;ervable in the&s;e mountains.</P>
<P>THE inventive genius of this mechanical people is not
merely ob&s;ervable in the above-mentioned articles, but di&s;|covers
it&s;elf upon all occa&s;ions where it can be applied to the
purpo&s;es of their convenience and accommodations. To
give an in&s;tance: the rocks in mo&s;t parts of the alps being
exceedingly hard and &s;olid, the waters u&s;ually make their
way along their &s;ides, and ru&s;h down in perpetual torrents:
but the &s;trata which compo&s;e the Jura being le&s;s firm and
compact; the rains and melted &s;now penetrating into the
crevices, form &s;ubterraneous channels, and i&s;&s;ue in rivulets
at the bottom of the mountains. Now the pea&s;ants, in order
to avail them&s;elves of this peculiarity, have, in the mid&s;t of
the&s;e &s;ubterraneous channels, and with much labour, erected
mills, which are turned by the de&s;cending torrents. For this
purpo&s;e the builders have con&s;tructed wheels in places
where it &s;eemed &s;carcely practicable: have invented new
modes of &s;caffolding, and a great variety of other ingenious
contrivances in order to facilitate their work. The natives
of the&s;e di&s;tricts are exceedingly courteous to &s;trangers who
vi&s;it their country. They are in general very well informed
in &s;everal branches of knowledge; and, as they u&s;ually em|ploy
their lei&s;ure hours in reading, many of the villages con|tain
circulating libraries. The hou&s;es are plai&s;tered and
<PB N="433" REF="461">
white-wa&s;hed; though &s;mall, are commodious and well-built;
and furni&s;hed with a degree of neatne&s;s, and even ele|gance,
peculiarly &s;triking in the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered mountains.
Such perfect ea&s;e and plenty reigns throughout the&s;e moun|tains,
that I &s;carcely &s;aw one object of poverty: the natu|ral
effects of indu&s;try under a mild and equitable govern|ment.
It is of the&s;e vallies, and of their inhabitants, that
Rou&s;&s;eau gives &s;o enchanting a de&s;cription in his letter to
D'Alembert.</P>
<P>THE rock which forms the ba&s;e of the Jura, is mo&s;tly
compo&s;ed of calcareous &s;tone; and perhaps there is no &s;pot in
Europe where are found &s;o large a quantity of petrified &s;hells
and marine plants in &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace. Near Locle I ob&s;erved
a ridge of hills, that &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t entirely of <HI>pierres
arbori&s;&eacute;es,</HI> or &s;tones bearing the impre&s;&s;ion of plants. In
returning, we had a mo&s;t &s;ublime pro&s;pect of the lakes
of Neuchatel, Bienne, and Morat, with the high and rug|ged
chain of alps &s;tretching from the cantons of Berne
and Friburgh, as far as the Vallais, and the mountains
of Chablais.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 47.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF NEUCHATEL.</HEAD>
<P>ON the death of the duche&s;s of Nemours, in 1707, the
&s;overeignty of Neuchatel and Vallengin became va|cant;
and being claimed by Frederic the Fir&s;t, king of
Pru&s;&s;ia, as heir to the prince of Orange, his right was ac|knowledged
by the &s;tates of the country. Upon his death it
de&s;cended to his &s;on Frederic William, who tran&s;mitted it
with his other dominions to Frederic the Second.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution of Neuchatel is a limited monarchy.
The machine of this government is indeed actuated by &s;uch
nice &s;prings, and its wheels are &s;o exceedingly complicated,
that it is very difficult for a &s;tranger to di&s;tingui&s;h, with
any degree of accuracy, the prerogatives of the &s;overeign,
and the franchi&s;es of the people: particularly as &s;ome, even
of their mo&s;t important privileges, depend upon mutual
acquie&s;cence and immemorial cu&s;tom, and not upon written
laws. I &s;hall endeavour, however, to trace the principal fea|tures
of this government; the re&s;ult of my be&s;t inquiries
during my continuance at Neuchatel.</P>
<P>UPON the acce&s;&s;ion of Frederic the Fir&s;t a charter of
privileges, under the name of general articles, which in a
great mea&s;ure e&s;tabli&s;hed the prerogatives of the prince, and
the liberties of the &s;ubject, was &s;igned and ratified by the
<PB N="435" REF="463">
king. Be&s;ide the&s;e general articles, which his pre&s;ent ma|je&s;ty
upon his acce&s;&s;ion promi&s;ed to pre&s;erve inviolate;
others were added at the pacification of 1768, which fini&s;hed
the di&s;pute between the &s;overeign and &s;ubject. By this pa|cification,
the king not only renewed his a&s;&s;ent to the <HI>general</HI>
articles; but al&s;o explained them, wherever their tenor had
been mi&s;taken; and expre&s;sly confirmed &s;everal other privi|leges
in favour of the people, which had hitherto been equi|vocal,
or not duly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t important of the&s;e general articles are: 1. The
&s;overeign promi&s;es to maintain the Reformed religion as by law
e&s;tabli&s;hed; and to tolerate no other &s;ect, except within the di&s;|tricts
of Landeron and Cre&s;&s;ier, where the catholic religion is
dominant. 2. No per&s;on but a native of the country is capa|ble
of holding any civil or military charge, excepting that of
governor, who may be a foreigner; and the &s;ame incapacity is
extended even to natives, who are in the &s;ervice of a foreign
prince. 3. All the &s;ubjects have a right to enter into the &s;ervice
of a foreign power; provided that power is not in actual war
again&s;t the prince, as &s;overeign of Neuchatel; and if the &s;o|vereign
&s;hould be engaged in ho&s;tilities, which do not concern
Neuchatel, that &s;tate may continue neuter, except the Hel|vetic
body &s;hould be involved in the conte&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The latter clau&s;e of this article is not &s;o clearly worded as it might have been; from a delicacy, I &s;uppo&s;e, of not expre&s;s|ly &s;tipulating, that the &s;tate of Neuchatel and Vallengin may oppo&s;e their &s;overeign by arms, in ca&s;e the Swi&s;s &s;hould be engaged in any war again&s;t him. It is evident, how|ever, that they con&s;ider their connection with the Helvetic body, as of &s;uperior ob|ligation to that with their prince, as &s;ove|reign of Neuchatel and Vallengin.</P>
<P>The remarkable clau&s;e in que&s;tion is as follows:
Et qu'en outre et conform&eacute;ment &agrave; des ar|ticles expr&eacute;s et formels des franchi&s;es tant de la bourgeoi&s;ie de Neufch&acirc;tel que de celle de Vallengin, cet Etat ne pui&s;&s;e &eacute;tre engag&eacute; dans aucune guerre, ni les &s;ujets d'icclui oblig&eacute;s d'y marcher, que ce ne &s;oit pour la propre guerre du Prince, c'e&s;t &agrave; dire, pour la defence de l'Etat, et pour les guerres que le Prince pour|roit avoir en tant que &s;ouverain de Neufchatel et non autrement: en &s;orte que s'il avoit guer|re pour rai&s;on de quelque autre Etat, terres et &s;eigneuries, l'Etat de Neufchatel ne &s;oit point oblig&eacute; d'y entrer; mais en ce cas devra demeu|rer dans la neutralit&eacute;, &agrave; moins que tout le corps Helvetique en g&eacute;neral n'y prit part et in|t&eacute;r&eacute;t.</P></NOTE>. 4. Ju&s;tice
<PB N="436" REF="464">
&s;hall be equitably admini&s;tered: and, for this purpo&s;e, the
three e&s;tates of Neuchatel and Vallengin &s;hall be annually
a&s;&s;embled. 5. The magi&s;trates and officers of ju&s;tice, in|&s;tead
of holding their employments during plea&s;ure, &s;hall
enjoy them during their good behaviour. And, by the late
pacification it was further agreed, that the prince is not
him&s;elf the judge of their good behaviour; but that in order
to be deprived of their places, they mu&s;t be fully convicted
of malver&s;ation in office, by certain judges at Neuchatel ap|pointed
for that purpo&s;e. 6. The &s;overeign &s;hall take the
accu&s;tomed oath upon his acce&s;&s;ion; and promi&s;e to main|tain
all the rights, liberties, franchi&s;es, and cu&s;toms, written
or unwritten.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights of
the &s;ubject, depends upon immemorial u&s;age; for, that
&startq;the &s;overeign &s;hall be con&s;idered as re&s;ident only at Neu|chatel,&endq;
is in the number of their unwritten immunities.
Now this privilege, in conjunction with the third article ju&s;t
cited, forms the ba&s;is of their civil liberty. By the former,
the prince, when ab&s;ent, can only addre&s;s his &s;ubjects
through his governor and the council of &s;tate; and no &s;ub|ject
can be tried out of the country, or otherwi&s;e than by
<PB N="437" REF="465">
judges appointed by the con&s;titution; by the latter, &s;hould
the king of Pru&s;&s;ia be at war with all Germany; the people
of Neuchatel and Vallengin are by no means obliged to arm
in his defence; but individuals may even &s;erve again&s;t him,
&s;o long as the powers whom they &s;erve, are not engaged in
ho&s;tilities again&s;t their country<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When Henry duke of Longueville, and &s;overeign of Neuchatel, was, in 1650, &s;ent to the ca&s;tle of Vincennes, Felix de Mareval, captain of the Swi&s;s guards, kept guard in his turn, though he was citizen of Neuchatel, at the door of the pri&s;on, in which <HI>his &s;overeign</HI> was confined.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDE the&s;e general articles, that comprehend the privi|leges
of the people at large; there are others which the &s;ove|reign
is equally bound to maintain, relating to the town of
Neuchatel and the di&s;trict of Vallengin, in particular. The
prince confers nobility, nominates to the principal offices of
&s;tate, both civil and military, and appoints the chatelains and
mayors, who pre&s;ide in the courts of ju&s;tice. His revenues,
which are very moderate, and &s;carcely amount to &pound;. 5,000 a
year, ari&s;e from certain deme&s;nes; from a &s;mall land-tax;
from the tythes of wine and corn; and from the tenth of the
value on the &s;ale of immoveables. With regard to com|merce,
no &s;ubject pays any duties either of importation or
exportation, except for foreign wines imported into the town
of Neuchatel.</P>
<P>DURING the ab&s;ence of the prince, he is repre&s;ented by a
governor of his own appointing; who enjoys con&s;iderable
honours, but is extremely limited in his authority. He con|vokes
the three e&s;tates, pre&s;ides in that a&s;&s;embly, and has the

the re&s;pective mayors in the principality of Neuchatel, ac|cording
to a regulated order; the third is compo&s;ed of four
coun&s;ellors of the town of Neuchatel. The judges in the
fir&s;t and &s;econd divi&s;ion hold their places for life; tho&s;e in
the third and appointed annually. This body ordinarily a&s;|&s;embles
every year in the month of May; but is convoked
extraordinarily upon particular occa&s;ions: the town of Neu|chatel
is always the place of meeting. The&s;e three e&s;tates
are not the repre&s;entatives of the people; nor do they po&s;|&s;e&s;s
the legi&s;lative authority. They are, properly &s;peaking,
the &s;upreme court of judicature, which receives all appeals,
and decides finally all cau&s;es, even tho&s;e relating to the &s;o|vereignty
of the country: a power which they exerci&s;ed in
<PB N="439" REF="467">
the year 1707, upon the extinction of the direct line in the
per&s;on of the duche&s;s of Nemours.</P>
<P>IT may be here not unworthy of remark, that the three
e&s;tates decided the famous cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in 1707,
as a proce&s;s between the &s;everal claimants of the &s;overeignty.
But if (in failure of claimants) a new &s;overeign was to be
cho&s;en, or a new form of government to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; this
would no longer be con&s;idered as amenable to a court of ju|dicature:
the que&s;tion would then come before the people
a&s;&s;embled by means of their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>THE council of &s;tate is inve&s;ted with the ordinary admi|ni&s;tration
of government, &s;uperintends the general police,
and is entru&s;ted with the execution of the laws. The mem|bers
nominated by the &s;overeign are not limited to any par|ticular
number. The prince exerci&s;es his authority by
means of this council, in which he is always con&s;idered as
per&s;onally pre&s;iding: and the power of the pre&s;ident is only
to convoke the a&s;&s;embly, to propo&s;e the &s;ubject of their con|&s;ideration,
to collect the votes, and to decide when the voices
are equal. The ordinances of this council are previou&s;ly
communicated to the <HI>mini&s;traux</HI> of Neuchatel, who are to
certify, that they contain nothing contrary to law.</P>
<P>THE town of Neuchatel enjoys very con&s;iderable privi|leges:
it has the care of the police within its own di&s;trict,
and is governed by its own magi&s;tracy, con&s;i&s;ting of a Great
and Little Council. I will not trouble you with a detail of
the &s;everal departments; but I cannot omit mentioning the
<PB N="440" REF="468">
<HI>mini&s;traux;</HI> becau&s;e the members of that body form the
third e&s;tate on every act of legi&s;lation. The <HI>mini&s;traux</HI> are a
kind of committee from the council of the town, and are en|tru&s;ted
with the admini&s;tration of the police. They con&s;i&s;t
of the two pre&s;idents of that council, four ma&s;ter-burghers
drawn from the Little Council, and the <HI>banneret</HI> or guar|dian
of the people's liberties. The &s;ix former are changed
every two years; the banneret is cho&s;en by the general
a&s;&s;embly of the citizens, and continues in office during
&s;ix years.</P>
<P>THE legi&s;lative authority is divided in &s;o complicated a
manner, that it would be no ea&s;y ta&s;k to determine preci&s;ely
where it ab&s;olutely re&s;ides: perhaps the following account
of the per&s;ons concerned, and of the forms ob&s;erved, in en|acting
and promulgating laws, may &s;omewhat a&s;&s;i&s;t in clear|ing
the difficulty.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the cau&s;es are decided by the three e&s;tates a&s;|&s;embled
in the month of May; the four judges, who form
the third e&s;tate, retire; and their place is &s;upplied by the
four <HI>mini&s;traux.</HI> The attorney-general then de&s;ires the
members of the three e&s;tates to take into con&s;ideration, whe|ther
it be nece&s;&s;ary to frame any new laws. When a new
ordinance is propo&s;ed; a declaration is drawn up, and deli|vered
to the council of &s;tate for their deliberation, whether
it is contrary to the prerogatives of the prince, or to the
rights of the &s;ubject: from thence it is communicated to the
council of the town, in order to be examined, whether it in|&s;ringes
the privileges of the citizens. If adopted by the
<PB N="441" REF="469">
council of &s;tate, and the council of the town, it is propo&s;ed
to the prince for his approbation or rejection: in the former
ca&s;e, it is again publicly read before the three e&s;tates; and
the governor, or pre&s;ident, declares the approbation of the &s;o|vereign.
It is then promulgated, or, as the expre&s;&s;ion is,
pa&s;&s;ed into a law by the three e&s;tates. Since the acce&s;&s;ion of
the hou&s;e of Brandenburgh, the people of Vallengin are al|ways
con&s;ulted upon the framing of a new law. For this
purpo&s;e the three ma&s;ter-burghers of Vallengin examine,
whether it contains any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the fran|chi&s;es
of that di&s;trict; in which ca&s;e they have the power
of remon&s;trating to the governor in council. From this de|tail
it &s;hould &s;eem, that the legi&s;lative authority re&s;ides con|junctively
in the prince, the council of &s;tate, and the town;
that the people of Vallengin have a kind of negative voice;
and that the three e&s;tates propo&s;e and promulgate the laws.</P>
<P>EVERY year, at the conclu&s;ion of the a&s;&s;embly of the
three e&s;tates of Neuchatel, tho&s;e of Vallengin, as con&s;tituting
the &s;upreme court of judicature for that country, meet at
Vallengin, and decide finally all appeals from the inferior
courts of ju&s;tice. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e three e&s;tates is formed by
the &s;ame four noble and &s;enior coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, who &s;it in
the fir&s;t of the three e&s;tates of Neuchatel; the <HI>&s;econd</HI> by four
mayors of the county of Vallengin; and the <HI>third</HI> by four
members of the court of ju&s;tice of Vallengin, nominated by
the mayor of Vallengin. The governor, or, in his ab&s;ence,
the &s;enior coun&s;ellor, pre&s;ides, as in tho&s;e of Neuchatel.
The three e&s;tates of Vallengin have no interference in any
act of legi&s;lation: the laws which have been framed or
<PB N="442" REF="470">
amended at Neuchatel, in the manner above-mentioned,
being &s;imply remitted to them by the &s;olicitor-general, and
publicly read before them. The people of Vallengin a&s;&s;em|ble
every three years in an open plain, in order to elect their
three <HI>ma&s;ter-burghers,</HI> who are re&s;pectively cho&s;en from the
inhabitants of the burgh of Vallengin, of the Val de Ruz,
and of the mountains. The function of the&s;e ma&s;ter-burgh|ers
is to watch over the general intere&s;ts of the people:
they are al&s;o in &s;ome ca&s;es deputed to Neuchatel by the peo|ple,
whenever they are &s;ummoned by the governor and
council of &s;tate, in relation to any affair which particularly
concerns their county.</P>
<P>THE principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin is divided
into a certain number of di&s;tricts, each of which has its cri|minal
court of ju&s;tice. The great circum&s;pection ob&s;erved
in the judicial proceedings, may &s;ometimes favour the e&s;cape
of the criminal: but the few in&s;tances of atrocious crimes,
prove that this humane caution is no encouragement to
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; and is a &s;trong pre&s;umption of the general
good morals which prevail among the people. In a word,
per&s;onal liberty is almo&s;t as tenderly and as &s;ecurely pro|tected
by the laws of this country, as by tho&s;e of our own
invaluable con&s;titution. When the criminal is arre&s;ted, he
is immediately brought to trial: after which, the &s;entence is
read to him in pri&s;on. The next morning he again appears
before the judges, a&s;&s;embled in the <HI>open air;</HI> the former
proceedings on the trial are read, and the judges once more
deliver their opinion. In capital &s;entences, the governor is
in&s;tantly acquainted with the circum&s;tances of the crime;
<PB N="443" REF="471">
and if he does not remit or &s;often the puni&s;hment, the &s;en|tence
is immediately executed. I am concerned to add, that
<HI>torture</HI> (though &s;eldom u&s;ed) is not ab&s;olutely aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>SUCH are the general outlines of this remarkable con&s;ti|tution,
by which the liberties of the people are as well, and
perhaps better, &s;ecured than even in the democratical can|tons;
for, although the mo&s;t de&s;potic prince in Germany is
&s;overeign, his power is exceedingly limited. Among the
&s;triking circum&s;tances which characteri&s;e this government,
mu&s;t be mentioned the very liberal encouragement given to
&s;trangers, who &s;ettle in the country. They enjoy every
po&s;&s;ible privilege of trade and commerce; and in no &s;tate
are fewer e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinctions made between &s;trangers and
natives. I have already ob&s;erved to you, the good effects of
this enlarged policy on the population of Neuchatel and
Vallengin: whereas a narrower and more contracted prin|ciple
in &s;ome of the neighbouring Swi&s;s cantons, has oc|ca&s;ioned,
and continues to occa&s;ion, a very manife&s;t decrea&s;e
of inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ROUTE FROM PONTARLIER TO NEUCHATEL&mdash;VAL|LEY
OF TRAVERS&mdash;ANECDOTES OF ROUSSEAU&mdash;ISLE
OF ST. PETER, IN THE LAKE OF BIENNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Neuchatel, <DATE>October 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW write to you a &s;econd time from Neuchatel, at the
interval of nine years &s;ince the date of my former letters.
On the preceding occa&s;ion I went from Gran&s;on to Neu|chatel;
to-day I came from Pontarlier, a &s;mall town in Bur|gundy,
which is the u&s;ual route of tho&s;e who enter Switzer|land
on this &s;ide.</P>
<P>FROM Pontarlier I a&s;cended gently by the &s;ide of the
Dou, here a &s;mall rivulet bubbling in the vale, quitted that
&s;tream, and pa&s;&s;ed under a bold rock, on which &s;tands the
ca&s;tle of Joux forming a picture&s;que land&s;cape. This ca&s;tle
has a garri&s;on of invalids, and commands the narrow valley
leading into Burgundy. Near it the road is divided into two
branches; one leads directly to Joigne, and the other to Neu|chatel.
In about two hours we ob&s;erved a &s;tone, which
&s;eparates France from the county of Neuchatel. Soon after|wards
we mounted an eminence, looked down upon the
beautiful valley of Travers; de&s;cended to a narrow pa&s;s,
which is guarded by a chain fa&s;tened to the rock, bearing
the date of 1722. Hi&s;tory, however, makes mention of this
pa&s;s, and of a &s;imilar chain, at a much earlier period; parti|cularly
<PB N="445" REF="473">
in 1476, when Charles the Bold, having ineffectually
attempted to force the pa&s;s, marched with his army to
Joigne, and be&s;ieged Gran&s;on, where he was defeated. Hav|ing
de&s;cended to St. Sulpice, I vi&s;ited the &s;ource of the Reus,
which i&s;&s;ues at the foot of a rock in five copious &s;prings,
that form a large body of water, and turn &s;everal mills. I
was accompanied to this picture&s;que &s;pot by an inhabitant
of Fleurier, a neighbouring village: &s;peaking of the in|crea&s;e
of indu&s;try in the&s;e parts, he informed me, that about
thirty years ago Fleurier contained only three watch|makers,
whereas at pre&s;ent above a hundred were &s;ettled
in that place. He added, that notwith&s;tanding the con|&s;tant
influx of &s;trangers, hands were &s;till wanting for
the numerous trades, which are carried on with great &s;uc|ce&s;s
in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>I CONTINUED along the high road leading to Neuchatel
through the beautiful and romantic valley of Travers,
watered by the Reus, abounding in the mo&s;t fertile pa&s;tures,
bordered by hills gently ri&s;ing from the banks of the river,
and beautifully &s;prinkled with wood. I travelled through
many neat villages, particularly Bouvere&s;&s;e, Couvet, Travers
which gives its name to the whole valley; and Noirague,
where I quitted the valley, and entered a narrow pa&s;s called
<HI>Clu&s;ette.</HI> From hence the road traver&s;es an abrupt and
woody country along the &s;ides of precipices, the Reus rolling
beneath in a deep channel. At the &s;mall village of Brot,
a plea&s;ing view of the lake of Neuchatel and the adjacent
country opened gradually, as I de&s;cended, and joined the
road leading from Gran&s;on to Neuchatel.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="474">
I DID not quit the valley of Travers without paying a
vi&s;it to Moitier Travers, rendered memorable by the re&s;i|dence
of Rou&s;&s;eau, who being, in 1762, driven fir&s;t from
Geneva, afterwards from Yverdun by the government of
Berne, found a refuge from civil and theological per&s;ecution
in this &s;ecluded valley, under the protection of Lord Keith,
governor of Neuchatel. The dwelling-hou&s;e of this &s;ingular
man, is a &s;mall wooden building at the further extremity of
the village, near the road which leads to Fleurier, and is now
occupied by Mr. Martinet, mayor of the valley, a &s;en&s;ible old
gentleman, who lived in habits of great intimacy with the
philo&s;opher of Geneva. The room chiefly occupied by
Rou&s;&s;eau, is a &s;mall bed-chamber, which, out of re&s;pect to
his memory, is left in the &s;ame &s;tate as when he lived there.
In a corner near the window, he had made a kind of rece&s;s
formed by two book-ca&s;es, and a &s;imple deal plank which
reached from one book-ca&s;e to the other, and on which he
was accu&s;tomed to write. Rou&s;&s;eau admitted company into
this room; but into the rece&s;s he &s;uffered no one to enter,
from a &s;u&s;picion, that they would overlook his papers when
he was writing. He u&s;ed al&s;o to frequent a &s;mall open
gallery in the front of the hou&s;e, the extremities whereof he
had enclo&s;ed with planks, in which were peep-holes for the
purpo&s;e of reconnoitring tho&s;e per&s;ons who came to vi&s;it
him, that he might give his orders whether they &s;hould be
admitted or refu&s;ed. Here he walked and read.</P>
<P>DURING his re&s;idence at Moitier, from 1762 to 1765, by
frequently &s;auntering into the fields and neighbouring
mountains, he acquired a ta&s;te for the &s;tudy of botany,
<PB N="447" REF="475">
which he never intermitted, and which he always &s;tyled his
peculiar delight. During this period of his life, he i&s;&s;ued
from this &s;ecluded corner his <HI>Lettre &agrave; l'Archev&ecirc;que de Paris,</HI>
his <HI>Lettres Ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> and &s;ome other works;
in which he di&s;plays tho&s;e wonderful powers of invention
and de&s;cription, that fa&s;cinating yet declamatory eloquence,
that glow and animation of &s;tyle, that fondne&s;s for para|doxes,
that reverence for the &s;criptures and yet tho&s;e per|ver&s;e
doubts of their authenticity, tho&s;e liberal yet levelling
principles of government, that keenne&s;s of irony, and that
motley mixture of &s;ophi&s;try and argument, which checker
and characteri&s;e all his writings.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU, on his arrival at Moitier, appeared in a com|mon
dre&s;s, but &s;oon afterwards a&s;&s;umed an Armenian habit;
either, as he him&s;elf alledged, becau&s;e that mode of clothing
was adapted to the di&s;order with which he was afflicted; or
from that affectation of &s;ingularity, which &s;eems to have
marked his character, in every period of his life. Through
Lord Keith's interce&s;&s;ion, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia offered to
Rou&s;&s;eau a pen&s;ion of &pound;. 100 per annum, which he declined,
from his aver&s;ion to the lea&s;t &s;hadow of dependence; pre|ferring
to copy mu&s;ic for his livelihood, rather than to ac|cept
an obligation even from &s;o great a &s;overeign; and he
u&s;ed to boa&s;t, that he could daily earn a guinea by that oc|cupation.
He took his repa&s;t u&s;ually alone; though he
would &s;ometimes, but very rarely, accept an invitation from
M. Martinet to dinner or &s;upper; and particularly when
Lord Keith pa&s;&s;ed a week at Moitier Travers for the purpo&s;e
of vi&s;iting him. On the&s;e occa&s;ions he was remarkably
<PB N="448" REF="476">
agreeable and lively; being naturally of a &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition,
he conver&s;ed with great &s;pirit and animation, and yet with as
much correctne&s;s, as if he was dictating for the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU &s;eems to have tru&s;ted entirely to his own judg|ment;
being &s;o impatient of contradiction, that he would
never li&s;ten to the admonition of his friends, and &s;eldom
a&s;ked advice with an intention of adopting it. Having
fini&s;hed his celebrated Letter to the Archbi&s;hop of Paris, he
read it to a per&s;on, from whom I received the anecdote, and
demanded his advice relative to its publication. The per&s;on,
though &s;truck with the fire and &s;pirit of the raillery, yet
could not avoid repre&s;enting to him, that his letter, however
forcibly written, would never make a convert of the Arch|bi&s;hop;
that he would only be entangled in endle&s;s contro|ver&s;ies,
and draw upon him&s;elf much obloquy and ill-will.
&startq;Your advice, returned Rou&s;&s;eau calmly, is a little too late;
it is already publi&s;hed:&endq; and immediately pre&s;ented to him
a printed copy of the letter, which he had ju&s;t read to him
in manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>HE derived from nature an extreme &s;en&s;ibility which
bordered upon weakne&s;s; he &s;eems to have wanted one
proof of a great mind, that of receiving an obligation, and
to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch pride and &s;orene&s;s of temper as ren|dered
it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;erve him; for he frequently con&s;trued
a benefit into an injury. His extreme &s;en&s;ibility was irritated
and augmented by a trouble&s;ome and painful di&s;order, which
preyed upon his con&s;titution, and at times rendered him
unfit for &s;ociety. And to this complaint, in conjunction with
<PB N="449" REF="477">
that mercile&s;s per&s;ecution which he repeatedly endured,
&s;hould be attributed in a great mea&s;ure the reclu&s;ene&s;s of his
life, and that &s;u&s;picious mi&s;tru&s;t which occa&s;ionally bordered
upon madne&s;s.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU had now continued three years at Moitier,
greatly delighted with his &s;ituation, when an unexpected
event induced him to quit a retreat, in which he wi&s;hed to
pa&s;s the remainder of his days. This event has been va|riou&s;ly
related. Some authors a&s;&s;ert, that the populace, in|cited
by the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, in con&s;equence of the
&s;ceptici&s;m di&s;played in his <HI>Lettres Ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> a&s;|&s;embled
in crouds, broke the windows of his hou&s;e, forced
open the door, and entering his bed-chamber, treated him
with &s;uch violence that he e&s;caped with difficulty; and, not
to become a martyr to his opinions, quitted the country.
Others on the contrary maintain, that neither the mini&s;ter
nor the natives were exa&s;perated again&s;t him; that his
hou&s;ekeeper, the &s;ame per&s;on whom he afterwards married,
di&s;gu&s;ted with the inhabitants, broke the windows, and per|&s;uading
her ma&s;ter, that he was in danger of being a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated,
&s;o worked upon his apprehen&s;ions, that he quitted
Moitier the next morning; and as a proof of this a&s;&s;ertion,
they affirm, that one of the &s;tones found in the apart|ment
was too large to have pa&s;&s;ed through the broken
panes of gla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE truth, however, &s;eems to be, that his pride and
&s;u&s;picious temper had rendered him obnoxious to many of
the inhabitants; that the &s;ceptici&s;m and in&s;idelity of his reli|gious
<PB N="450" REF="478">
opinions, in his <HI>Lettres Ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> had
rai&s;ed a party again&s;t him; that &s;ome of the people would
occa&s;ionally in&s;ult him; that the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h &s;um|moned
him before the con&s;i&s;tory; that he declined appear|ing;
that the council of &s;tate at Neuchatel had propo&s;ed con|demning
the above-mentioned publication, and had even ap|plied
to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia for that purpo&s;e. Frederic, in
an an&s;wer, which does honour to his head and his heart,
while he permitted them to u&s;e any precautions which might
tend to prevent the &s;preading of &s;ceptical opinions, yet wi&s;ely
forbade all per&s;ecution, and en&s;ured to Rou&s;&s;eau a &s;ecure re|treat
at Moitier under his immediate protection. Before this
an&s;wer was returned, &s;ome of the populace, intoxicated with
liquor, threw &s;tones again&s;t Rou&s;&s;eau's windows with &s;uch
violence as to penetrate into the kitchen, and to tear off the
plai&s;ter from the walls; but it is certain that none of the&s;e
&s;tones did, or could, enter his bed-chamber, as that apart|ment
was &s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the hou&s;e. This
violence, however, exaggerated by the real or pretended
terrors of his hou&s;ekeeper, was &s;ufficient to alarm Rou&s;&s;eau;
on the next morning he retired from Moitier, and took re|fuge
in the i&s;land of St. Peter.</P>
<P>THE i&s;land of St. Peter, &s;ometimes called the i&s;land of La
Motte, and &s;ometimes Rou&s;&s;eau's i&s;land, lies towards the
&s;outhern extremity of the lake of Bienne. To this delight|ful
&s;pot I made an agreeable excur&s;ion on the fourth of
October 1786, in company with the Rev. M. de Meuron, of
Neuchatel, and three Engli&s;h gentlemen. We quitted Neu|chatel
in the morning; pa&s;&s;ed through St. Blai&s;e and the di&s;|trict
<PB N="451" REF="479">
of Landeron, and embarked at Neuville, a &s;mall town,
which, like Bienne, acknowledges the bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le for its
liege lord, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch rights and immunities as render
it an independent republic. It contains about twelve hun|dred
inhabitants. The fine weather, and the clearne&s;s of
the air, enabled us to enjoy the mild beauties of the view as
we &s;ailed to the i&s;land. To the &s;outh-we&s;t we di&s;cerned
Neuville and its antient ca&s;tle, and to the &s;outh-ea&s;t we
admired the Julimont, and in&s;ulated hill adorned with woods
of oak, the &s;ummit of which is frequently vi&s;ited by travel|lers
for the beauty of the pro&s;pect; and its name has been
derived by fanciful antiquaries from Julius Cae&s;ar. At the
extremity of a rocky and woody promontory, which &s;tretches
from the foot of the Julimont into the lake, &s;tands the ca&s;tle
of Cerlier, and beyond, at &s;ome di&s;tance, the fertile plains
watered by the Thiele. We landed on the &s;outh-&s;ide of St.
Peter's i&s;land, and walked through an agreeable meadow
&s;kirted with vineyards to a large farm-hou&s;e, which was
formerly a convent<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It was &s;eculari&s;ed at the reformation.</NOTE>, and is now inhabited by the &s;teward
of the general ho&s;pital at Berne, to which the i&s;land
belongs.</P>
<P>THE i&s;land is about two miles in circumference, and
richly wooded with various &s;hrubs and trees, particularly
with large oaks, beech, and Spani&s;h che&s;nuts. Its &s;urface
is gently undulating; the &s;outhern &s;hore, covered with
herbage, forms a gradual &s;lope to the lake; the remaining
borders are &s;leep and rocky: in a few places their &s;ummits
<PB N="452" REF="480">
are thinly fringed with &s;hrubs; in others their perpen|dicular
&s;ides are clothed to the water's edge with hanging
woods. The views from the different parts of the i&s;land are
beautiful and diver&s;ified; that to the north is the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive
and plea&s;ing. It commands the lake of Bienne,
which is of an oval form: its cultivated borders &s;potted
with villages and ca&s;tles, with the towns of Nidau and
Bienne &s;tanding on the farther extremity. Agreeable
walks are carried through the woods, and terminate at a
circular pavillion placed in the center of the i&s;land. During
vintage particularly, and on Sunday, which is the u&s;ual day
of fe&s;tivity, the i&s;land is filled with parties who take refre&s;h|ments
at the farm-hou&s;e, &s;tray about the woods, or dance in
the circular building, and animate the&s;e romantic but &s;o|litary
&s;cenes.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU occupied an apartment in the farm-hou&s;e,
the only dwelling in the i&s;land. He lived with the &s;teward
and his family, who are the pre&s;ent inhabitants. The
woman informed me, that he paid for his board and lodging
forty &s;hillings a month, that he u&s;ually ro&s;e at &s;ix, dined
with the family at twelve, and after a &s;light &s;upper retired
to re&s;t at nine. She added, that he was extremely cheerful
and agreeable; conver&s;ed with the family with the greate&s;t
ea&s;e and complacency, and conformed to their hours and
manner of living; that he amu&s;ed him&s;elf entirely in wan|dering
about the woods, and &s;earching for plants, which he
u&s;ed to explain to them with &s;ingular &s;atisfaction. Rou&s;&s;eau
mentions his re&s;idence in this delightful i&s;land with the
highe&s;t terms of rapture, and his u&s;ual pronene&s;s to exagge|ration.
<PB N="453" REF="481">
&startq;I was permitted to remain only two months in
this delightful i&s;land; but I could have pa&s;&s;ed there two
years, two centuries, all eternity, without &s;uffering a
moment's <HI>ennui,</HI> although my whole &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ted of the
&s;teward and family, good but plain people. I e&s;teem the&s;e
two months the mo&s;t happy period of my life; and &s;o
happy, that I could have pa&s;&s;ed my whole exi&s;tence with|out
even a momentary wi&s;h for another &s;ituation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Promenade V.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IF we examine in what this <HI>extreme</HI> happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted;
he him&s;elf informs us, that his principal occupation was in
<HI>doing nothing.</HI> He did not even unpack his books, and
could &s;carcely prevail on him&s;elf to read, much le&s;s to
an&s;wer any letters. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;teward and his &s;ervants
at work in the vineyards and fields; &s;auntered about the
woods, and gave him&s;elf up entirely to botany. He pro|po&s;ed
to write a <HI>Flora Petrin&s;ularus,</HI> or a de&s;cription of
the plants in the i&s;land; adding on this head, that as a
German had publi&s;hed a book on the kernel of a lemon, in
the &s;ame manner he would compo&s;e a treati&s;e on each
&s;pecies of gra&s;s, mo&s;s, and lichen; and that he would not
leave the mo&s;t minute particle of vegetation unde&s;cribed.
He made occa&s;ional excur&s;ions on the lake, &s;ometimes
coa&s;ting the &s;hady banks of the i&s;land; at other times &s;uffer|ing
the bark to float without direction into the middle of
the lake: then, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ions, &startq;he would lie
down in the boat, look up to the heavens, and continue in
that po&s;ture for &s;everal hours, enjoying a thou&s;and uncon|nected
<PB N="454" REF="482">
and confu&s;ed, but delicious reveries.&endq; He frequently
rowed to a &s;mall &s;andy i&s;land, which he de&s;cribes as a mo&s;t
beautiful &s;pot. It was one of his great amu&s;ements to peo|ple
this little i&s;land with rabbits; and as he was conveying,
with <HI>great pomp,</HI> the &s;teward's family to be pre&s;ent at the
foundation of this little colony, he de&s;cribes him&s;elf as
<HI>equally elated with the pilot of the Argonautic expedition.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e &s;imple avocations and <HI>every day</HI> occurrences,
which Rou&s;&s;eau relates with that enthu&s;ia&s;m and tho&s;e &s;en|timents
peculiar to him&s;elf, he draws the following &s;ublime
morality. &startq;I have remarked, during the vici&s;&s;itudes of a
long life, that the mo&s;t delightful enjoyments and mo&s;t
rapturous plea&s;ures, are not, upon recollection, tho&s;e with
which I am mo&s;t affected. Such fleeting moments of pa&s;|&s;ion
and delirium, however rapturous, are, from their very
nature, but thinly &s;cattered in the path of life. They are
too rare and rapid to con&s;titute a fixed &s;tate; and the hap|pine&s;s
which my heart regrets, is not compo&s;ed of fugitive
in&s;tants, but con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;imple and permanent &s;tate, with|out
rapture, the duration of which increa&s;es the charm, till
it finds &s;upreme felicity.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS &s;tate he de&s;cribes him&s;elf as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing during his
&s;hort continuance in the i&s;land of Bienne; a longer re&s;idence
would probably have di&s;&s;olved the charm, which was rai&s;ed
by his own heated imagination. That re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of tem|per,
which is u&s;ually the attendant of great genius, and
which was his in&s;eparable companion, would have probably
returned, and embittered the delightful calm which he de|&s;cribes
<PB N="455" REF="483">
with &s;uch rapture and ex&s;tacy. But he had not time
to become di&s;gu&s;ted with his &s;ituation: for the &s;ame into|lerant
&s;pirit which had hitherto pur&s;ued him, followed him
even to this &s;eque&s;tered i&s;land; and he had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed two
months, before he received an order from the government
of Berne to depart from their territories. Rou&s;&s;eau was &s;o
&s;hocked at this unexpected command, that he petitioned to
be impri&s;oned for life, only reque&s;ting the u&s;e of a few
books, and that he might be occa&s;ionally permitted to walk
in the open air. Soon after this extraordinary reque&s;t, which
&s;hews the extreme agitation of his mind, and which cannot
but intere&s;t every man of feeling, he reluctantly quitted the
i&s;land. It does not fall within the compa&s;s of a letter to dwell
upon this &s;ingular man through the &s;ub&s;equent events of
his life, or even accompany him to England, where, notwith|&s;tanding
the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed reception, the &s;ame perver&s;e|ne&s;s
of di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;ame exce&s;&s;ive delicacy ren|dered
him no le&s;s unhappy, than when he was under the
pre&s;&s;ure of real calamities, and expo&s;ed to reiterated per|&s;ecutions.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ENVIRONS OF MORAT&mdash;MOUNT VUILLY.</HEAD>
<P>IN our way to Morat and Avenches we cro&s;&s;ed the river
Thiele, which i&s;&s;ues from the lake of Neuchatel, di&s;|charges
it&s;elf into that of Bienne, and &s;eparates the prin|cipality
of Neuchatel from the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>MORAT is a bailliage belonging to Berne and Friburgh:
the reformation was introduced in 1530, by the majority of
voices, in pre&s;ence of deputies from Berne and Friburgh.
The free &s;pirit of the Swi&s;s governments is in no in|&s;tance
more remarkably apparent, than by the mode which
they ob&s;erved in embracing, or rejecting, the reformation;
as, in many other towns be&s;ide Morat, the que&s;tion was put
to the vote; and the minority generally &s;ubmitted, with
perfect acquie&s;cence, to the deci&s;ion of the greater number.
Morat &s;tands plea&s;antly upon the edge of a &s;mall lake, about
&s;ix miles long, and two broad; in the mid&s;t of a well-culti|vated
country. The lakes of Morat and Neuchatel are
parallel to each other, and &s;eparated only by a ridge of
hills: the former is the mo&s;t elevated; for, it di&s;charges it&s;elf
by means of the river Broye, into the latter. According to
Mr. de Luc, the lake of Morat is fifteen French feet above
the level of that of Neuchatel. Both the&s;e lakes, as well as
that of Bienne, formerly extended much farther than their
<PB N="457" REF="485">
pre&s;ent limits: and, from the po&s;ition of the country, ap|pear
to have been once united.</P>
<P>MR. PENNANT informs me, that &startq;the va&s;t fi&s;h called
the <HI>&s;ilurus glanis,</HI> or the <HI>&s;aluth,</HI> which frequents the lakes
of Morat and Neuchatel, has not been caught here in the
memory of man. It is well de&s;cribed, and finely engraven,
in Doctor Bloch's Hi&s;tory of Fi&s;hes, vol. i. 194. tab. 34.
In the time of Ge&s;ner two were taken, one of which was
eight feet long; but they are &s;ometimes &s;o large as to
weigh &s;ix hundred pounds. It is an eel-&s;haped fi&s;h, very
&s;mooth, round and thick, and has a great head. The mouth
is furni&s;hed with four &s;hort, and two very long, whi&s;kers.
It is very inactive and &s;low in its motions, and loves the
deep and muddy parts of the lakes. They are found in
many of the great fre&s;h waters of Europe, and abundantly
in the Volga.&endq;</P>
<P>ON my &s;ub&s;equent expeditions into the&s;e parts, I exa|mined
with greater attention the environs of Morat, during
&s;everal days, which I pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t agreeably at Coujouvaux,
a &s;eat belonging to the count of Die&s;bach, and at Grens with
M. de Garville, a French gentleman, who is &s;o much at|tached
to the beauties of this delightful country, that he
has built a villa in a plea&s;ing &s;ituation near the banks of
the lake of Morat, where he comes every year from Paris to
pa&s;s the &s;ummer. By the&s;e families I was received without
any other introduction, than as being the author of the Letters
on Switzerland, and with that frankne&s;s and cordiality &s;o
<PB N="458" REF="486">
flattering to a &s;tranger. I found the environs of Morat,
though not &s;o wild and romantic as many other parts of
Switzerland, yet extremely de&s;irable for a con&s;tant re&s;i|dence.</P>
<P>I MADE &s;everal excur&s;ions acro&s;s the lake, to an in&s;ulated
ridge between the lakes of Neuchatel and Morat, and en|joyed
many delightful points of view. Of the&s;e various
pro&s;pects, the mo&s;t remarkable is from the &s;ummit of Mount
Vuilly, where I &s;eated my&s;elf on the edge of an abrupt pre|cipice.
From thence I looked down upon the lakes of
Bienne, Morat, and Neuchatel; ob&s;erved the Broye entering
the lake of Morat, i&s;&s;uing from thence and winding through
a mar&s;hy plain into the lake of Neuchatel; the Thiele flow|ing
from thence, and ha&s;tening to fall into the lake of
Bienne; the fertile and variegated countries encircling tho&s;e
bodies of water; and the grounds ri&s;ing in regular gradations
from plains to alps. But what renders this charming &s;pot
more particularly &s;triking is, that it is perhaps the only
central point from which the eye can at once comprehend
the va&s;t amphitheatre formed, on one &s;ide, by the Jura
&s;tretching from the environs of Geneva as far as Ba&s;le,
and, on the other, by that &s;tupendous chain of &s;nowy alps,
which extends from the frontiers of Italy to the confines
of Germany, and is lo&s;t at each extremity in the im|men&s;e
horizon.</P>
<P>IMPRESSED with this &s;ublime view, I ca&s;t my eyes down|wards
over that dead and exten&s;ive mora&s;s through which
<PB N="459" REF="487">
the Broye &s;erpentines; and cried out in the language of
poetry, which knows how to animate the dulle&s;t objects:</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BATTLE OF MORAT&mdash;WAR BETWEEN THE SWISS
AND CHARLES THE BOLD, DUKE OF BURGUNDY&mdash;ITS
CONSEQUENCES.</HEAD>
<P>MORAT is celebrated for the ob&s;tinate &s;iege it &s;u&s;tain|ed
again&s;t Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy,
which was followed by the battle of Morat, fought on the
22d of June 1476. In this famous engagement the duke was
routed, and his whole army almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed, by the
confederate troops of Switzerland. Not far from the town,
and adjoining to the high road, a monument of this victory
&s;till remains: it is a &s;quare building, filled with the bones of
the Burgundian &s;oldiers, who were &s;lain at the &s;iege and in
the battle. To judge from the quantity of the&s;e bones, the
number of the &s;laughtered mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable.
Among &s;everal in&s;criptions in the Latin and German lan|guages,
relative to that memorable victory, I tran&s;cribed the
following on account of its conci&s;ene&s;s:
<Q>Deo Opt: Max:

Burgundiae Ducis Exercitus
Muratum ob&s;idens ab Helvetiis
Cae&s;us hoc &s;ui Monumentum reliquit.
Ann: 1476.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="489">
THIS war, which Charles the Bold carried on again&s;t the
Swi&s;s with a temerity peculiar to him&s;elf, forms a remark|able
aera in the hi&s;tory of this country; and was attended
with &s;ome very extraordinary circum&s;tances. From the
time of the famous revolution in 1308, which gave ri&s;e to the
Helvetic confederacy, to the end of the following century,
the Swi&s;s republics deprived the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria of all its
territories &s;ituated in Switzerland; and continued in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
notwith&s;tanding the various attempts of the different
dukes to recover their lo&s;t domains. But of all the princes
of that Hou&s;e, Sigi&s;mond the &s;imple, archduke of Au&s;tria of
the branch of Tyrol, was more particularly engaged in ho&s;ti|lities
with the Swi&s;s cantons, and their allies: for, his here|ditary
dominions in Suabia and Al&s;ace bordering upon Swit|zerland,
induced him to enter more frequently into the&s;e
di&s;putes, than the other branch, which was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the imperial throne.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the&s;e ho&s;tilities, Sigi&s;mond was compelled
to cede a con&s;iderable part of his territories to the Swi&s;s re|publics;
particularly the rich country of Thurgau to the
&s;even cantons, which at that period compo&s;ed the Helvetic
league<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Berne obtained the co-regency of Thurgau at the peace of Arau, 1712.</NOTE>. Inflamed by the&s;e repeated lo&s;&s;es, and the humi|liating
conditions of peace he was con&s;trained to accept in
1468, he endeavoured to engage &s;ome of the neighbouring
powers in a confederacy again&s;t the Swi&s;s cantons. Having
fir&s;t ineffectually applied to Louis the Eleventh king of
<PB N="462" REF="490">
France, he at length addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Charles the Bold,
duke of Burgundy.</P>
<P>CHARLES having &s;ucceeded to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Franche
Comt&eacute;, Burgundy, Artois, and Flanders, together with the
greate&s;t part of the United Provinces; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as ample re|venues,
and as exten&s;ive territories, as the mo&s;t potent &s;ove|reign
of his time. Magnificent, impetuous, and enterpri&s;ing,
he neglected no opportunity of aggrandi&s;ing his power, and
&s;et no bounds to the projects of his re&s;tle&s;s ambition. He
had formed the plan of erecting Burgundy into a monarchy;
and had already in imagination appropriated to him&s;elf Lor|raine
and part of Switzerland; which he propo&s;ed to annex
by conque&s;t to his hereditary dominions.</P>
<P>A PRINCE of &s;uch a character being naturally well di&s;|po&s;ed
to li&s;ten to any overtures, or to undertake any war,
that might advance his ambitious &s;chemes, received with
eagerne&s;s the propo&s;itions of Sigi&s;mond; he flattered that
credulous prince with the hopes of receiving in marriage his
daughter Mary, heire&s;s of his exten&s;ive dominions; and pre|vailed
upon him, by the loan of eighty thou&s;and florins, to
&s;urrender Sundgau, Al&s;ace, Bri&s;gau, and the four Fore&s;t|towns;
promi&s;ing, upon the repayment of that &s;um, to re|&s;tore
the provinces. By this alliance, Sigi&s;mond acquired a
&s;um of money to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his preparations again&s;t the
Swi&s;s; protected, as he thought, his hereditary dominions
from their enterpri&s;es; and &s;ecured a powerful ally again&s;t
the antient enemies of his family. The rever&s;e, however,
<PB N="463" REF="491">
proved to be the event: for, by a &s;trange fatality, this
league, which was intended to cement the union of the two
princes, &s;erved only to divide them; and occa&s;ioned the fir&s;t
perpetual alliance between the Swi&s;s cantons and a prince
of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>CHARLES, upon the conclu&s;ion of this treaty, informed
the cantons, that he had taken Sigi&s;mond under his pro|tection,
and would defend him to the utmo&s;t of his power.
Meanwhile, the bailifs, whom he placed over his newly
acquired territories in Al&s;ace, oppre&s;&s;ed the people; laid em|bargoes
upon the commerce of Mulhau&s;en, a confederate
of the cantons; and withheld the rents of the e&s;tates be|longing
to the Swi&s;s in Sundgau and Al&s;ace. The&s;e griev|ances
being laid before Charles in an emba&s;&s;y, which Berne
di&s;patched to his court in the name of the confederate can|tons,
the duke received it with haughtine&s;s; and after com|pelling
the deputies to kneel while they delivered their re|mon&s;trance,
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them without an an&s;wer. This di&s;|dainful
and ignominious treatment was ill brooked by a free
people, unaccu&s;tomed to crouch before the in&s;olence of
power; and the warmth of their ju&s;t indignation was &s;till
more inflamed by the artful policy of Louis the Eleventh,
who, jealous of the duke of Burgundy's power, entered into
a defen&s;ive alliance with the Swi&s;s republics, in order to
counteract the de&s;igns of that ambitious prince.</P>
<P>BUT Louis &s;till further &s;trengthened the Swi&s;s, by effect|ing
a reconciliation between them and Sigi&s;mond. The latter
had no &s;ooner &s;urrendered to Charles Sundgau, Al&s;ace, and
<PB N="464" REF="492">
the other dominions, than he became &s;en&s;ible of his error.
The duke of Burgundy not only oppre&s;&s;ed his new &s;ubjects,
but &s;eemed determined, even &s;hould the eighty thou&s;and
florins be repaid, to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e conditional terri|tories,
and did not appear inclined to fulfil the promi&s;e of
be&s;towing his daughter upon the archduke. From the&s;e
con&s;iderations, Sigi&s;mond, induced through the mediation
of Louis, to throw him&s;elf under the protection of the Swi&s;s,
concluded the famous treaty, which was confirmed at Lu|cerne
in 1474, and is called the <HI>hereditary union;</HI> an appel|lation
appropriated to the treaties between the Swi&s;s and the
Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Sigi&s;mond renounced all right to the
provinces which the Swi&s;s had conquered from the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria: the two contracting parties formed a defen&s;ive
alliance; and engaged to guarantee reciprocally each other's
territories. Thus the Swi&s;s, after having deprived Sigi&s;mond
of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in their country, engaged to &s;upport
his title to tho&s;e very provinces, which he had mortgaged
in order to &s;trengthen his arms again&s;t them&s;elves; and
Sigi&s;mond accepted a guarantee from the mo&s;t inveterate
enemies of his family. This treaty, which entirely changed
the policy of the Swi&s;s republics, was &s;olely contrived by
the artful intrigues of Louis the Eleventh: the jealou&s;y of
that de&s;igning monarch turned into another channel the
va&s;t preparations of the duke of Burgundy; preparations
which would probably have been attended with more &s;uc|ce&s;s,
had they been directed again&s;t France.</P>
<P>CHARLES too late perceiving the imprudence of his con|duct
towards the Swi&s;s republics, in vain exerted all his
<PB N="465" REF="493">
efforts to engage them in a neutrality. They rejected his pro|po&s;als
of reconciliation with firmne&s;s, prepared, with their
u&s;ual vigour, for a war, which now appeared inevitable, and
even advanced the eighty thou&s;and florins to Sigi&s;mond,
who demanded the re&s;titution of his lands, which the duke
of Burgundy evaded under various pretexts. Charles
having concluded a &s;eparate peace with Louis, turned his
whole force again&s;t the Swi&s;s, entered their country with an
army of &s;ixty-thou&s;and men; and, laying &s;iege to Gran&s;on,
carried it by a&s;&s;ault. But his &s;ucce&s;s ended there: for, at
the &s;ub&s;equent battles of Gran&s;on and Morat, he was totally
defeated, and his attempts upon Switzerland entirely fru&s;|trated
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Charles entered Switzerland confi|dent of &s;ubduing that country. The effect which this unexpected and humiliating di&s;|appointment had upon his &s;pirits and con|&s;titution, is related by Philip de Comines, with his u&s;ual minutene&s;s, in his Memoirs addre&s;&s;ed to Angelo Cattho, archbi&s;hop of Vienne in Dauphin&eacute;. His account is curious, and will give &s;ome idea of the violent and impetuous character of Charles:</P>
<P>&startq;His concern and di&s;traction for his fir&s;t de&s;eat at Gran&s;on was &s;o great, and made &s;uch deep impre&s;&s;ion on his &s;pirits, that it threw him into a violent and dan|gerous fit of &s;ickne&s;s: for, whereas before, his choler, and natural heat was &s;o great, that he drank no wine, only in the morn|ing he took a little ti&s;ane, &s;weetened with con&s;erve of ro&s;es, to refre&s;h him&s;elf: this &s;udden melancholy had &s;o altered his con|&s;titution, he was now forced to drink the &s;tronge&s;t wine that could be got, without any water. And, in order to draw the blood from his heart, &s;ome burning tow was put into the cupping gla&s;&s;es, and applied to his &s;ide. But this, my lord of Vienne, you know better than I; for, your lord&s;hip attended on him during the whole cour&s;e of his illne&s;s, and &s;pared no pains that might contribute to his reco|very: and it was by your per&s;ua&s;ion that the duke was prevailed upon to cut his beard, which was of a prodigious length. In my opinion his under&s;tanding was never &s;o perfect, nor his &s;en&s;es &s;o &s;edate and compo&s;ed, after this &s;it of &s;ickne&s;s, as before.&endq;</P>

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&startq;And what,&endq; &s;ays Comines, &startq;was the occa&s;ion of this war? It was begun on account of a waggon of &s;heep-&s;kins, which the lord of Romont took from a Swi&s;s, who was pa&s;&s;ing through his ter|ritories. If God had not abandoned the duke, it is not probable, that he would have put him&s;elf into &s;o much danger for &s;o trifling a circum&s;tance; con&s;idering the offers that were made to him; again&s;t what &s;ort of people he was engaged; and from whence neither profit nor glory could accrue to him. For, the Swi&s;s were not in &s;uch repute, as they are in at pre&s;ent, and nothing could be poorer: in&s;omuch that one of their amba&s;&s;adors, as he was endeavouring to prevent the duke from engaging in that war, remon&s;trated; that he could gain nothing by attacking them: for their country was &s;o barren, that the &s;purs of his troops and the bits of their hor&s;es were worth more, than could be furni&s;hed by all the Swi&s;s territories, in ca&s;e they were conquered.&endq;</NOTE>. In fact, the principal and almo&s;t &s;ole benefit
accrued to Louis the Eleventh; as, by the death of Charles,
he not only was relea&s;ed from a dangerous and enterpri&s;ing
rival, but al&s;o annexed the rich provinces of Burgundy and
Artois to the crown of France. But, although the immediate
advantages which the Swi&s;s derived from the death of
Charles, were unimportant; yet the con&s;equences operated
very con&s;iderably on their future politics. Mary of Bur|gundy,
the only &s;urviving child and heire&s;s of Charles, mar|ried
<PB N="467" REF="495">
the archduke Maximilian, elde&s;t &s;on of the emperor
Frederic the Third, and afterwards emperor him&s;elf. By
this marriage, the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Netherlands; and having frequent di&s;putes with France,
the alliance of the Swi&s;s was &s;trenuou&s;ly courted by both
parties. Thus this country, being &s;ecured from all inva&s;ions,
acceded as occa&s;ion offered to the two rival powers; and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
each party by turns, as the intrigues, or rather as the
&s;ub&s;idies, of the one or the other prevailed.</P>
<P>THESE intrigues gave ri&s;e to different alliances, contracted
with the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, the kings of France, the pope,
and the dukes of Savoy and Milan.&mdash;But, not to enter more
minutely into their hi&s;tory, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve in general,
that hitherto the Swi&s;s had acted with great di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s
in all their treaties, and had never taken the field but either
with a view to &s;ecure their liberties, or to drive their enemies
from Switzerland. It was about the period of the Burgun|dian
war, that the &s;ub&s;idies which they obtained from Louis
the Eleventh, taught them the di&s;graceful arts of mercenary
politics; as the rich plunder which they took from the duke
of Burgundy gave, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the fir&s;t taint to their
original &s;implicity of manners; till at length, <HI>Swi&s;s vena|lity</HI>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANTIQUITIES OF AVENCHES.</HEAD>
<P>FEW antient towns have occa&s;ioned more controver&s;y
among antiquarians, or given ri&s;e to &s;uch a variety
of conjectures concerning its origin and importance, as
Avenches, the principal burgh of a bailliage in the Pays de
Vaud. Some contend that it was the capital of all Helvetia;
becau&s;e Tacitus calls it <HI>Aventicum gentis caput:</HI> while others
have endeavoured to prove, that by this expre&s;&s;ion the hi&s;|torian
intended only to denote the capital town of its particu|lar
di&s;trict. Agreebly to &s;ome accounts, the city was built,
and a Roman colony founded, by Ve&s;pa&s;ian: with more
probability, according to others, it was only repaired and
beautified by that emperor, after it had been laid wa&s;te, and
almo&s;t ruined, by Vitellius.</P>
<P>WITHOUT entering into dry and unintere&s;ting di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions,
I &s;hall &s;imply relate, that it was formerly a very con&s;i|derable
town, and under the dominion of the Romans; as
appears not only from &s;everal mile&s;tones, found in many
parts of the Pays de Vaud, mo&s;t of which are numbered
from <HI>Aventicum,</HI> as the principal place of reference; but
more particularly from the pre&s;ent ruins. I &s;hall &s;lightly
mention a few of the&s;e ruins, merely to &s;hew you, that the
inhabitants do not boa&s;t of their antiquity without &s;ufficient
evidence. We traced the &s;ite of the antient walls, which ap|pear
<PB N="469" REF="497">
to have enclo&s;ed a &s;pace near five miles in circum|ference.
The pre&s;ent town occupies but a very incon&s;ider|able
part of this ground; the remainder is covered with
corn-fields and meadows. One of the antient towers &s;till
exi&s;ts: it is a &s;emicircular building, with the convex &s;ide
turned towards the town.</P>
<P>WE next examined a coar&s;e mo&s;aic pavement, di&s;covered
&s;ome years ago in ploughing a field. Being now enclo&s;ed
by a barn, which is let to &s;ome pea&s;ants, the ignorant occu|piers
are taking the mo&s;t effectual method to de&s;troy it, by
employing it as a drying-hou&s;e for tobacco, and by &s;uffering
&s;trangers to take away &s;pecimens. Even the government of
Berne was &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of its value, that they permitted the
count of Caylus to remove a pannel, containing the figures
of two Bacchanalians. This mo&s;aic was the floor of an an|tient
bath, and is about &s;ixty feet in length and forty in
breadth: the general form is perfect; and although &s;everal
parts are broken and lo&s;t, yet from the pre&s;ent remains the
configuration of the whole may be ea&s;ily traced.</P>
<P>THE pavement con&s;i&s;ts of three compartments: tho&s;e at
each extremity are regularly divided into fifteen octagons,
eight &s;mall &s;quares, and &s;ixteen &s;mall triangles. Five of
the&s;e octagons in each compartment, repre&s;ented human
figures in various attitudes, but chiefly Bacchanalian men
and women: the remaining octagons were compo&s;ed of
three different patterns. The vacant parts between the octa|gons
are &s;illed with the &s;mall &s;quares; and towards the out|ward
border, with the &s;mall triangles. The middle compart|ment
is divided into oblong pannels; in the large&s;t of which
<PB N="470" REF="498">
is an octagon bath of white marble, of abotu &s;ix feet in
diameter, and a foot and a half deep: the &s;ides of the
bath are ornamented with dolphins. Of the&s;e three com|partments,
one is almo&s;t perfect; the others are very much
defaced. Each of the pannels is encircled with &s;everal bor|ders
prettily diver&s;ified; and a general border enclo&s;es the
whole. Schmidt, in his <HI>Recueil d'Antiquit&eacute;s de la Sui&s;&s;e,</HI> in|geniou&s;ly
conjectures, from a <HI>glory</HI> which &s;urrounds a head
of Bacchus in this mo&s;aic, that it was wrought during &s;ome
part of the intervening age between Ve&s;pa&s;ian and Marcus
Aurelius; becau&s;e that mark of divinity is not u&s;ual upon
any monuments of Roman antiquity prior to that period.
He adds, that the &s;ame kind of <HI>glory</HI> is ob&s;erved upon the
head of Trajan in an antient painting at Rome; upon that of
Antoninus Pius on a medal; and on the arch of Con&s;tan|tine<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The arch of Con&s;tantine at Rome being partly formed from the Forum of Trajan, the architect improperly transferred the figures. This circum&s;tance accounts for the <HI>glory</HI> ob&s;erved round the head of Trajan, on the arch of Con&s;tantine, which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to have repre&s;ented the head of Con&s;tantine.</NOTE>. He &s;trengthens this conjecture, by further remark|ing,
that the head-dre&s;s of a Bacchanalian woman repre&s;ented
in this mo&s;aic, re&s;embles the head-dre&s;s on the medals of
the empre&s;&s;es Plotina and Sabina<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The curious reader will find in the <HI>Recueil,</HI> cited in the text, a very accurate de|&s;cription and engraving of this mo&s;aic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM thence we were conducted to the ruins of an an|tient
amphitheatre, within the walls of the bailif's garden.
The general form and &s;ize of this building are tolerably
perfect, as al&s;o parts of the brick-walls which enclo&s;ed it. The
diameter of the arena was, as well as we could judge by pa|cing
<PB N="471" REF="499">
it, about eighty yards; which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have
been an uncertain e&s;timate: as a former bailif brought in a
con&s;iderable quantity of earth, in order to plant fruit-trees;
conceiving, I &s;uppo&s;e, that good fruit was of more value,
than to be able to determine the preci&s;e extent of an antient
amphitheatre. Under a tower, partly built of Roman mate|rials,
is a cell in which the animals were probably let loo&s;e
upon the arena. On the out&s;ide are &s;till to be &s;een the re|mains
of five dens: and the walls are adorned with &s;everal
pieces of rude &s;culpture con&s;iderably defaced.</P>
<P>NOT far from the&s;e ruins &s;tands a large column of white
marble, about fifty feet in height, compo&s;ed of large ma&s;&s;es,
nicely joined together without cement; and near it lies a
con&s;iderable fragment of defaced &s;culpture, which &s;eems to
have once formed part of the portal belonging to a magnifi|cent
temple. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from this column, in the
high road, we ob&s;erved a covnice of white marble, &s;culptured
with urns and griffins. As we walked through the town,
we remarked &s;everal other ma&s;&s;es of cornice, ornamented
with &s;ea-hor&s;es and urns; and &s;ome marble columns of
beautiful proportions.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile from Avenches, near the village of Coppet,
on the other &s;ide of a little &s;tream, which &s;eparates the
canton of Friburgh from that of Berne, are the remains of
a &s;mall aqueduct. They were di&s;covered about fifteen
years ago, by the accidental falling of a &s;and-hill which co|vered
the aqueduct. The out&s;ide is formed of &s;tones and
mortar, and the in&s;ide of red Roman cement; the vault of
<PB N="472" REF="500">
the arch may be about two feet and a half high, and one
and a half broad. This aqueduct has been traced to the
ea&s;t-&s;ide of the town, and al&s;o to near the marble column
before-mentioned. We were al&s;o informed that it extends
to the tower of Gau&s;a, between Vevay and Lau&s;anne: and
that, between Villar&s;el and Marnau, about four leagues from
Coppet, an arch of nearly the &s;ame dimen&s;ions is excavated
in the &s;olid rock. But whether the&s;e &s;everal parts actually
communicated with each other, or indeed whether they
really exi&s;t, are facts which, (having only viewed tho&s;e re|mains
that are vi&s;ible near this town) I mu&s;t be contented
to re&s;t on the credit of my informers.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I vi&s;ited the ruins of Avenches in October 1786, I
had much &s;atisfaction in finding, that the bailif, Mr. Tchar|ner,
paid great attention to the&s;e remains, and particularly
to the mo&s;aic. I could not avoid remarking to the bailif,
who politely favoured us with his company; that every lover
of antiquity mu&s;t regret, his predece&s;&s;ors had not &s;hewn the
&s;ame ta&s;te; as the ruins of Avenches would have been a
greater object of curio&s;ity. Several excavations had been
lately made, at fir&s;t by Lord Northampton, who has a hou&s;e
in the neighbourhood, and continued at the expence of
Berne. A coar&s;e mo&s;aic pavement, a few fragments of walls
rudely painted, and &s;ome trifling remains of antient baths,
are the only ve&s;tiges of antiquity hitherto di&s;covered.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TOWN AND CANTON OF FRIBURGH&mdash;POPULATION
&mdash;GOVERNMENT&mdash;SECRET CHAMBER.</HEAD>
<P>FRIBURGH was built in 1179, by Berchtold the
Fourth, duke of Zaeringen, who endowed it with con&s;i|derable
privileges. Upon the extinction of the male line of
the hou&s;e of Zaeringen, in 1218<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The hou&s;e of Zaeringen was de&s;cend|ed from the antient counts of Al&s;ace, by Berchtold count of Bri&s;gau. His grand&s;on, Berchtold the Second, built the ca&s;tle of Zaeringen, &s;ituated near a village of the &s;ame name, not far from the pre&s;ent town o$ Fri|burgh, capital of the Bri&s;gau. Upon the demi&s;e of Berchtold the Fifth, the la&s;t duke, without male i&s;&s;ue, his territories were di|vided between his collateral heirs, the dukes of Teck, and his two &s;i&s;ters Agnes and Anne. Agnes married Egeno, count of Urach; by which marriage he obtained po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Friburgh in the Bri&s;gau: his po&s;te|rity were called counts of Friburgh. Anne married Ulric, count of Kyburgh; their daughter Hedwige, was wi&s;e of Albert count of Hab&s;burgh, and mother of the emperor Rhodolph the Fir&s;t.</NOTE>, Ulric of Kyburgh obtained
the &s;overeignty, in right of his wife Anne, &s;i&s;ter of the la&s;t
duke of Berchtold the Fifth. It came by marriage into the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Eberhard count of Hab&s;burgh-Lauffenburgh;
who &s;old it to his cou&s;in Rhodolph of Hab&s;burgh, afterwards
emperor. During this period, a continual rival&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
between Berne and Friburgh, they were frequently engaged
in mutual ho&s;tilities: at length all differences were compo&s;ed;
and the two cities, in 1403, entered into a perpetual alliance.</P>
<P>FRIBURGH continued under the dominion of the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, and was concerned in all the quarrels in which that
<PB N="474" REF="502">
family was engaged with the Swi&s;s republics, until the mid|dle
of the fifteenth century; when, by a &s;ingular revolution,
it renounced all allegiance to the archduke Albert, and put
it&s;elf under the protection of the duke of Savoy. From this
aera it occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted the cantons again&s;t the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria; and in the war between the Swi&s;s and Charles the
Bold, its troops had a &s;hare in the victories of Gran&s;on and
Morat. Soon after the battle of Morat, it became a free and
independent republic; and, in 1481, was admitted a member
of the Helvetic confederacy.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the town, though not one of the mo&s;t
beautiful, is certainly one of the mo&s;t picture&s;que and wild
in Switzerland. It &s;tands partly in a &s;mall plain, partly on
bold acclivities, on a ridge of rugged rocks, half encircled
by the river Sane; and is &s;o entirely concealed by the cir|cumjacent
hills, that the traveller &s;carcely catches the &s;malle&s;t
glimp&s;e, until he bur&s;ts upon a view of the whole town from
the overhanging eminence. The fortifications, which con|&s;i&s;t
of high &s;tone walls and towers, enclo&s;e a circumference
of about four miles; within which &s;pace the eye compre|hends
a &s;ingular mixture of hou&s;es, rocks, thickets, and
meadows, varying in&s;tantly from wild to agreeable, from the
bu&s;tle of a town to the &s;olitude of the deepe&s;t retirement.
The Sane winds in &s;uch a &s;erpentine manner as to form in
its cour&s;e, within the &s;pace of two miles, five obtu&s;e angles,
between which the intervening parts of the current are pa|rallel
to each other.</P>
<P>ON all &s;ides the de&s;cent to the town is extremely &s;teep:
in one place the &s;treets even pa&s;s over the roofs of the hou&s;es.
<PB N="475" REF="503">
Many of the edifices are rai&s;ed in regular gradation like the
&s;eats of an amphitheatre: many overhang the edge of a pre|cipice
in &s;uch a manner, that on looking down, a weak head
would be apt to turn giddy; and an unfortunate lover, re|pul&s;ed
in his &s;uit, might in&s;tantly put an end to his pains,
by taking a leap from the parlour window, without the
trouble of a journey to Leucate, or to the rocks of Meillerie.
But the mo&s;t extraordinary point of view is from the Pont|neuf.
To the north-we&s;t, part of the town &s;tands boldly on
the &s;ides and the piked back of an abrupt ridge; and from ea&s;t
to we&s;t a &s;emicircle of high perpendicular rocks is &s;een, who&s;e
ba&s;e is wa&s;hed and undermined by the winding Sane, and
who&s;e tops and &s;ides are thinly &s;cattered with &s;hrubs and
underwood. On the highe&s;t point of the rocks, and on the
very edge of the precipice, appears, half-hanging in the air,
the gate of the town called Bourgillon: a &s;tranger &s;tanding
on the bridge would compare it to Laputa, or the Flying
I&s;land in Gulliver's Travels, and would not conceive it to be
acce&s;&s;ible but by means of a cord and pulleys. In the mid&s;t
of the river I ob&s;erved a large fragment of &s;tone, which a
few years ago fell from the rocky heights, was carried under
one of the arches, and in conjunction with other frag|ments
&s;topping the current, rai&s;ed it more than ten feet
above its u&s;ual level, threatening the lower parts of the town
with a &s;udden inundation.</P>
<P>A TRAVELLER fond of wild and romantic &s;cenery will
not fail to vi&s;it the Moulin de la Motte, and the valley of
Goteron. The Moulin de la Motte is a miller's dwelling,
hollowed in the mid&s;t of an impending rock; near it i&s;&s;ues
<PB N="476" REF="504">
a &s;mall torrent, which turning the mill, falls within a few
paces into the Sane. This &s;ingular dwelling &s;eems &s;o far
removed from &startq;<HI>the bu&s;y hum of men,</HI>&endq; as to be rather
&s;ituated in a remote &s;olitude, than within the walls of
a fortified town. Near it there is an a&s;cent of four hun|dred
&s;teps to the Place des Fontaines, in the upper part
of the town.</P>
<P>THE valley of Goteron, which lies on the north-we&s;t of
the town near the bridge leading to Berne, takes its name
from the Goteron, a &s;mall rivulet that runs through it, and
turns &s;everal mills. This valley, extremely narrow and
above two miles in length, is bounded on each &s;ide by high
and overhanging rocks of &s;and-&s;tone. M. Vernet, the cele|brated
land&s;cape painter, is &s;aid to have &s;tudied the&s;e rocks
with great attention; and frequently to have declared, that,
excepting tho&s;e of Tivoli, he never &s;aw any rocks who&s;e va|rying
tints had a more plea&s;ing and harmonious effect. The
valley contains &s;everal mills; an iron foundery, where the
ore brought from Franche Comt&eacute; is forged; and a manu|facture
of printed linen and cotton, lately e&s;tabli&s;hed by
&s;ome merchants of Neuchatel, under the protection and en|couragement
of government.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;es of Friburgh, con&s;tructed with a grey &s;and|&s;tone
drawn from a neighbouring quarry, are neat and well|built;
but the whole town has a dull and inanimate appear|ance.
Among the few objects worthy of particular notice in
the town, are, the cathedral, an elegant Gothic edifice,
erected in the latter end of the 14th century, and remarkable
<PB N="477" REF="505">
for the height and &s;olidity of the tower; the town-hou&s;e, an
antient building, which formerly compo&s;ed part of the palace
belonging to the dukes of Zaeringen; and al&s;o a lime-tree,
in the middle of the principal &s;quare. Tradition reports,
that this tree was in&s;tantly planted by one of the &s;oldiers, the
22d of June 1477, on his return from the battle of Morat:
an emblem of Swi&s;s liberty, which took deep root on the
memorable defeat of Charles the Bold; and thus remaining
firm again&s;t the conflicts of time, has continued to &s;pread and
flouri&s;h, to the admiration and example of future ages.
The &s;ociety of Friburgh is extremely agreeable; the gentry
are frank and ho&s;pitable, and blend French politene&s;s with
great &s;implicity of manners. Dinner is u&s;ually &s;erved at
twelve; and &s;upper &s;eldom later than eight. I never ex|perienced
a more cordial reception in any town of Swit|zerland.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Lau&s;anne, called here the bi&s;hop of Fri|burgh,
re&s;ides in this city. He is appointed by the pope,
u&s;ually at the recommendation of the French court; and his
revenues, including a &s;mall pen&s;ion from France, and from
the abbey of Hauterive, of which he was abbot, amount to
about &pound;. 400 <HI>per ann.</HI> His dioce&s;e extends over the whole
canton, and part of that of Soleure. In all his acts and deeds
he &s;igns him&s;elf Bi&s;hop and Count of Lau&s;anne, and Prince
of the German empire. The pre&s;ent bi&s;hop, Bernhard of
Lenzburgh, is a man of letters, and an honour to his profe&s;|&s;ion:
he is employed in preparing for the public a biogra|phy
of the illu&s;trious and learned men born in the canton of
<PB N="478" REF="506">
Friburgh, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, either in the
civil, military, or literary line.</P>

<P>THE &s;overeign power re&s;ides in the Great Council of Two
Hundred; comprizing the two Advoyers, the Chancellor, the
Grand Sautier, the Senate, or Little Council of Twenty-four,
the Sixty, from which body are cho&s;en the bannerets and
principal magi&s;trates, and the remaining hundred and twelve
members, who are &s;imply denominated Burghers.</P>
<P>THE only per&s;ons capable of being elected members of
this &s;overeign council, and of cour&s;e enjoying any &s;hare in
the government, are the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burghers, or a certain num|ber
of families divided into four <HI>bannieres,</HI> or tribes of the
town: they are called <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burghers, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h
them from the other citizens, partly inhabiting the town,
and partly the twenty-four pari&s;hes in the environs. The
latter enjoy the right of appointing the advoyers, from cer|tain
candidates propo&s;ed by the &s;ixty, and of annually con|firming
<PB N="479" REF="507">
the &s;aid magi&s;trates. Hence many authors have
called this government ari&s;to-democratical, but erroneou&s;ly:
for, as the power of the people is confined to the act of
choo&s;ing and confirming the two advoyers; and as the &s;u|preme
authority ab&s;olutely re&s;ides in the council of two
hundred, nece&s;&s;arily &s;upplied by a limited number of patri|cian
families, the government is, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, a
mere ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of troubling you with an unintere&s;ting detail
of tho&s;e points in which the government of Friburgh re|&s;embles
that of the other ari&s;tocratical cantons, I &s;hall confine
my&s;elf to tho&s;e peculiar circum&s;tances by which it is di&s;cri|minated
from them. This difference may be principally &s;aid
to con&s;i&s;t in three articles: 1. The <HI>blind ballot,</HI> or mode by
which &s;everal important offices are &s;upplied, and particularly
by which the members of the &s;enate and the &s;ixty are
cho&s;en. This mode of election was in&s;tituted in order to
prevent venality; and is too &s;ingular not to be di&s;tinctly ex|plained.
The names of the candidates are placed privately
in a box, containing as many partitions as there are per&s;ons
who &s;olicit the charge. Into each of the&s;e partitions the
electors throw in their &s;uffrages as chance directs, without
knowing to whom they may happen to give their votes;
and the candidate who has the mo&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;ual ballots is
elected. 2. The clau&s;e which di&s;ables certain noble families
from bearing the o$$ice of banneret, or from being cho&s;en
members of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber.</HI> The&s;e families are &s;ixteen
in number: &s;ome were acknowledged noble, even as early
as the foundation of the republic; others &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ob|tained
<PB N="480" REF="508">
titles of counts and barons from the foreign princes
to whom they were attached, and in who&s;e armies they
had &s;erved. 3. But the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance
which di&s;criminates the con&s;titution of Friburgh from that
of the other ari&s;tocratical cantons, is a committee di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the name of the <HI>Secret Chamber,</HI> which, though
not any public or re&s;pon&s;ible part of admini&s;tration, is yet
the concealed &s;pring that puts the wheels of government
in motion. As the prerogatives and operation of this <HI>&s;e|cret
chamber</HI> are in general but little known, and &s;till le&s;s
under&s;tood; I flatter my&s;elf that it will not be uninte|re&s;ting
to lay before you a conci&s;e account of its origin
and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;ecret chamber,</HI> forming a part of the council of
&s;ixty, is compo&s;ed of the four bannerets, who are recipro|cally
cho&s;en by the council of two hundred from the four
tribes; and of twenty-four members, who are appointed by
a majority of their own body: the former remain in office
four years; the latter continue for life. The <HI>&s;ecret chamber</HI>
a&s;&s;embles ordinarily four times in the year, or oftener if oc|ca&s;ion
requires: and is convoked by a banneret. The two
principal meetings of this body are between the Sunday be|fore
St. John's day and the twenty-fourth of June; and
u&s;ually on the anniver&s;ary of the battle of Morat, for the
purpo&s;e of appointing the vacant places in the council of
two hundred; and on Tue&s;day in Whit&s;un-week, when they
&s;upply the vacancies in their own body. Its origin is thus
traced in the records of the republic. From 1347 to 1387,
the three bannerets nominated twenty per&s;ons from each of
<PB N="481" REF="509">
the three tribes into which it was then divided; and the&s;e
&s;ixty a&s;&s;embled on the Sunday before St. John's day, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
the Little Council and elect the trea&s;urer; from hence
is derived the origin of the &s;ixty, and of the a&s;&s;embly which
meets on the Sunday now called <HI>Secret Sunday.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of
the whole council of two hundred, excepting the advoyers
and &s;enate, and is pre&s;ided by the chancellor, the four ban|nerets,
and the members of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber,</HI> who take the
places of the &s;enators. This a&s;&s;embly reviews, confirms, or
cen&s;ures, if nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;enators, the bannerets, and the
&s;ixty; the members of each tribe retire, while their conduct
is examined and reviewed by the remainder. The &s;ame a&s;|&s;embly
fills up al&s;o the vacant places in the &s;enate, and in the
&s;ixty, by blind ballot.</P>
<P>IN 1387, the nomination of the &s;ixty was transferred from
the bannerets to the a&s;&s;embly which met on the <HI>Secret Sun|day:</HI>
and that a&s;&s;embly was al&s;o empowered to appoint the
Little Council, the trea&s;urer, the &s;ixty, and the remaining
members of the two hundred. By a charter of the &s;ame
year, four coadjutors, drawn from the &s;ixty, were given to
each banneret: and it appears that the&s;e coadjutors were
cho&s;en, in the &s;ame manner as the bannerets, &s;eparately by
each tribe: and this may probably be con&s;idered as the ori|gin
of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber.</HI> A charter of the year 1392, con|firms
the <HI>Secret Sunday</HI> in the right of nominating the &s;ixty,
and confers on the bannerets that of choo&s;ing the <HI>prud|hommes,</HI>
who accompanied them when they convoked the
people on St. John's day; and it is probable that the ban|nerets
al&s;o appointed their coadjutors. This nomination
<PB N="482" REF="510">
took place, as at pre&s;ent, on the Tue&s;day in Whit&s;un-week.
The town being at that period only divided into three tribes,
the coadjutors were limited to twelve; and when a fourth
tribe was added, their number was augmented to &s;ixteen. A
charter dated 1404 confirms, in many in&s;tances, the&s;e arrange|ments;
but does not grant to the <HI>Secret Sunday</HI> the nomi|nation
of the two hundred: a right at that time enjoyed by
the bannerets, who &s;hared it with their coadjutors, or the
<HI>&s;ecrets;</HI> and thus is probably derived the power of appoint|ing
the members of the two hundred, &s;ince con&s;tantly exer|ci&s;ed
by the bannerets and <HI>&s;ecrets.</HI> The &s;ame charter orders
the bannerets to a&s;&s;emble on Whit-Tue&s;day, in conjunction
with the &s;ixty of the preceding year, for the purpo&s;e of
choo&s;ing four members of the &s;ixty from each tribe, who
&s;hould accompany the bannerets when they convoked the
a&s;&s;embly of burghers and inhabitants on St. John's day;
and two additional members for convening the a&s;&s;embly
of <HI>Secret Sunday.</HI> Here then are &s;ix per&s;ons from each
tribe employed in the&s;e convocations, or in all twenty-|four
per&s;ons, the number of members who now form
the <HI>&s;ecret chamber.</HI> The &s;ame charter al&s;o enjoins the
bannerets and <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> to collect the votes in all elections
and deliberations; an office which they continue to exer|ci&s;e
to this day.</P>
<P>AS early as the beginning of the 15th century, the ban|nerets
and <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> a&s;&s;embled at Chri&s;tmas and Ea&s;ter, for the
purpo&s;e of preparing and dige&s;ting &s;uch motions as were to
be laid before the Council of two hundred, which adopted,
modified, or rejected them. As the bannerets probably con|tinued
<PB N="483" REF="511">
to employ the &s;ame coadjutors in convoking the a&s;|&s;emblies
on St. John's day, and on <HI>Secret Sunday,</HI> the <HI>&s;ecret
chamber,</HI> compo&s;ed of the&s;e twenty-four coadjutors, at length
became a permanent body, and enjoys the following prero|gatives.
1. It convokes, in conjunction with the bannerets,
the people on St. John's day, and the a&s;&s;embly which meets
on <HI>Secret Sunday.</HI> 2. It prepares and draws up all the laws
and ordinances; enjoys the &s;ole power of propo&s;ing in the
Great Council; and, by means of the bannerets, of putting a
negative on any motion, by affirming it to be contrary to the
con&s;titution, without the nece&s;&s;ity of proving that it is &s;o.
3. It collects the votes in the election or confirmation of the
advoyer, at the meeting of the people on St. John's day, and
in the deliberations of the Great Council. 4. It fills up all
the vacancies in that Council; 5. Su&s;pends, depo&s;es, con|firms,
and cen&s;ures its members; 6. Confirms, or &s;u&s;pends
and depo&s;es its own members; makes regulations for the in|terior
admini&s;tration of its own body; appoints the manner
of electing its own members, and filling up the vacancies in
the Great Council; 7. Fixes on the time for tho&s;e elections,
and the &s;um of money which each member is permitted to
receive from tho&s;e who are elected. 8. It can exclude all
candidates from being cho&s;en members of the &s;enate, of
the &s;ixty, from the office of bailifs, and other important
charges; either by refu&s;al to pre&s;ent, or by rejecting them
as incapable. All the&s;e prerogatives, founded on authen|tic
documents, or immemorial u&s;age, were confirmed by
the Council of two hundred, in 1606, 1623, and particu|larly
in 1716.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="512">
ALL affairs of government, and all debates in the national
a&s;&s;emblies, are carried on in the German language; and as
the French tongue is &s;poken in the greate&s;t part of the can|ton,
and particularly by the gentry, there are many mem|bers
of the Great Council, who do not under&s;tand the de|bates.
Such was the general form of government when I
fir&s;t vi&s;ited Friburgh in 1776; &s;ince that period it has under|gone
&s;ome very important alterations, the &s;ub&s;tance of which
I &s;hall communicate to you in the following letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 53.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ORIGIN AND SUPPRESSION OF THE LATE TROU|BLES
IN THE CANTON OF FRIBURGH&mdash;CHANGES
IN THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE exclu&s;ive right of &s;haring in the admini&s;tration
of affairs, enjoyed by a certain number of families, in
the ari&s;tocratical cantons, hath, in conjunction with other
concurrent circum&s;tances, occa&s;ioned revolts in tho&s;e of Zu|ric,
Berne, and Lucerne, which have been quelled by the
interpo&s;ition of the other Helvetic powers, and prevented
from again breaking out, by judicious regulations. Fri|burgh
having exhibited a recent example of the &s;ame kind;
I have endeavoured to trace the origin and progre&s;s of tho&s;e
inte&s;tine commotions, which have been followed by a con&s;i|derable
alteration in the form of government. Accordingly,
I now lay before you the re&s;ult of my inquiries, impartially
drawn from repeated conver&s;ations with per&s;ons of both par|ties;
from an attentive peru&s;al of &s;everal publications written
during the cour&s;e of the troubles; and from &s;ome curious
manu&s;cripts, which it was my good fortune to obtain.</P>
<P>IN the latter end of April 1781, an in&s;urrection &s;uddenly
broke out in the bailliage of Gruyeres, a di&s;trict in the &s;outh|ern
part of the canton; the inhabitants whereof are ex|tremely
jealous of their liberties, and zealou&s;ly attached to
all the cu&s;toms tran&s;mitted from their ance&s;tors. Irritated
<PB N="486" REF="514">
by a few impolitic acts of government, by the petty vexa|tions
of the bailifs; by the &s;ecularization of Val Sainte, a
convent of Chartreux; by the abolition of &s;everal fa&s;ts and
fe&s;tivals; and excited by the artifices of Chenaux and Ca&s;tel|laz,
two de&s;igning leaders, they ro&s;e in open rebellion.</P>
<P>PETER NICHOLAS CHENAUX, the chief of the &s;edition,
was a native of la Tour de Treme, in the bailliage of Gruy|eres.
This man was greatly embarra&s;&s;ed in his circum|&s;tances,
and highly exa&s;perated again&s;t government, having
been arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned in 1771, for his di&s;obedient and
turbulent conduct. He was in the thirty-eighth year of his
age, of a good figure and expre&s;&s;ive countenance; and, being
a man of rude but popular eloquence, and of an overbearing
&s;pirit, had obtained a con&s;iderable influence over the artle&s;s
inhabitants. His abettor, John Nicholas Andrew Ca&s;tellaz,
was a burgher of Friburgh and advocate of Gruyeres:
ver&s;ed in all the chicanery of the law, conver&s;ant in the hi&s;|tory
and antient records of his country, and well acquainted
with the privileges of the people, he was the fir&s;t to expo&s;e
the &s;lighte&s;t oppre&s;&s;ions of the bailif, and to remark where|ever
government &s;eemed to infringe their immunities, or
i&s;&s;ued edicts contrary to long-e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;ages. Having a
loud voice, and vehement elocution, he was formed for po|pular
a&s;&s;emblies. He was the per&s;on by whom Chenaux
was principally directed in all difficult emergencies; he drew
up the principal remon&s;trances which, exaggerating every
de$ect in the con&s;titution, tended to render government
odious, and to &s;pread di&s;contents among the people.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="515">
THESE two leaders having, in conjunction with other ac|complices,
availed them&s;elves of the public di&s;&s;atisfaction,
and engaged a con&s;iderable number of adherents; held, in
the month of April 1781, regular meetings at Bulle. On
the 24th, in particular, they in&s;inuated before a large a&s;&s;em|bly,
that government had formed a de&s;ign of impo&s;ing addi|tional
taxes of a grievous nature, particularly on horned cat|tle
and hor&s;es; and even of with-holding the annual pre&s;ent
of &s;alt, which they &s;hared with the burghers of Friburgh.
They repre&s;ented, that the &s;ecularization of Val Sainte, and
the abolition of certain fe&s;tivals, implied a &s;ettled determina|tion
to overturn the religion of their ance&s;tors: that the go|verning
party had many enemies; that the de&s;poti&s;m of the
&s;ecret chamber was held in univer&s;al abhorrence; that the
nobles were di&s;contented, on account of their exclu&s;ion from
the principal charges of the commonwealth; that the
burghers and inhabitants of the twenty-four pari&s;hes were
jealous of the exorbitant rights po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ecret
burghers, to whom was exclu&s;ively confined the entrance
into the Great Council, and of cour&s;e into the admini&s;tration
of affairs, and the lucrative offices of government. They
added, that the time was now arrived, when they might ven|ture,
with impunity, to petition for a redre&s;s of grievances;
a &s;trong party in the capital was ready, on the fir&s;t moment
of their appearance, to join them; and multitudes would re|pair
from all quarters to the &s;tandard of liberty.</P>
<P>HAVING, by the&s;e and &s;imilar in&s;inuations, increa&s;ed the
number of their adherents, it was finally concluded, that, on
the 3d of May, they &s;hould &s;ecretly repair to the capital, and,
<PB N="488" REF="516">
a&s;&s;embling in the market-place, &s;hould force the ar&s;enal;
that, having provided them&s;elves with arms, they &s;hould &s;e|cure
the garri&s;on, and con&s;train the Great Council to re|dre&s;s
their grievances, and make tho&s;e changes in the con|&s;titution,
which could alone &s;ecure to the people a mild and
ju&s;t admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the general ferment which pre|vailed
among the people in the bailliage of Gruyeres, and the
number of per&s;ons concerned in this con&s;piracy; govern|ment
received no notice of the plot, before the 29th or 30th
of April. On the fir&s;t certain news of the intended in&s;urrec|tion,
the council of war, who immediately a&s;&s;embled on the
occa&s;ion, di&s;patched &s;ome troops to arre&s;t Chenaux; but he,
having received information from one of his accomplices
who happened to be at that time in the capital, e&s;caped to la
Tour de Treme; and, being joined by the mo&s;t de&s;perate of
his adherents, determined to take arms without delay. Hav|ing,
by means of his emi&s;&s;aries, excited the &s;pirit of rebel|lion
among the people, who were informed, that Chenaux
had narrowly e&s;caped an arre&s;t for his patriotic attempts to
&s;ecure their immunities; he ventured to repair to Gruyeres,
where Ca&s;tellaz had already collected a con&s;iderable party.
This advocate, having a&s;&s;embled a large body during the
night, expatiated, with much force and eloquence, on the
&s;everal grievances, u&s;ing various arguments in favour of an
immediate revolt, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which were urged on the
24th of April. He inflamed the populace to &s;uch a degree,
that they flew to arms at five in the morning, and impri&s;on|ing
the bailif, erected the &s;tandard of rebellion. The alarm
<PB N="489" REF="517">
being now given, Chenaux advanced to Po&s;ieux, which was
fixed upon for the place of general rendezvous; from
whence he addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the magi&s;trates of Fri|burgh,
di&s;claiming all de&s;ign of having recour&s;e to vio|lence,
and requiring only, that the petitions and remon|&s;trances
of the people &s;hould be taken into con&s;idera|tion.
On the next morning he conducted about &s;ixty of
his partizans to a height overlooking Friburgh, with an in|tention
of &s;urpri&s;ing the city; but finding the gates &s;hut, the
fortifications guarded, and not being joined, as he expected,
by the inhabitants of the twenty-four pari&s;hes, he retired
fir&s;t to Po&s;ieux, and afterwards to Avry, where he expected
a reinforcement, which Ca&s;tellaz and his emi&s;&s;aries were col|lecting
in various parts of the canton.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e &s;editious proceedings, the magi&s;trates of
Friburgh were active in making preparations for the &s;ecurity
of the town. The council of war &s;at during the whole night;
a night of extreme terror and anxiety to many of the inhabi|tants.
The account of the bailif's arre&s;t, of Chenaux's e&s;cape,
and that he was &s;tationed at Po&s;ieux, within two leagues of the
capital, with a corps of rebels who&s;e number rumour exag|gerated,
was no &s;ooner divulged, than a general panic pre|vailed.
The garri&s;on &s;carcely con&s;i&s;ted of more than fifty
&s;oldiers, and tho&s;e chiefly invalids; the fortifications were
weak and exten&s;ive; not more than two hundred burghers
could be mu&s;tered to defend the ramparts; and the in&s;ur|gents
were &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;trong party even within the
walls. If in this moment of di&s;order, aided by the darkne&s;s
of the night, Chenaux could have attacked the town with a
<PB N="490" REF="518">
&s;ufficient force, he might have carried it by a&s;&s;ault. But the
fir&s;t emotions of terror had no &s;ooner &s;ub&s;ided, than the be|&s;ieged
a&s;&s;umed a &s;pirit and vigour adequate to the alarming
&s;ituation of affairs. They all ran to arms; the nobles, burgh|ers,
and even &s;trangers, crouded to the ramparts, and pre|pared
for a vigorous defence. Their confidence was rai&s;ed
by the arrival of &s;ome militia from Morat, who entered the
gates at nine in the morning, and by the expectation of more
effectual &s;uccours from the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>ON the preceding evening a me&s;&s;enger had been di&s;|patched
to Berne, reque&s;ting immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He ar|rived
in that city &s;oon after midnight: the advoyer d'Erlach,
in the 85th year of his age, in&s;tantly &s;ummoned the Sove|reign
Council. &startq;Gentlemen,&endq; exclaimed the venerable
magi&s;trate, &startq;on other occa&s;ions you have a year to delibe|rate;
you mu&s;t now in&s;tantly act: Friburgh is be&s;ieged by
an army of rebels; let tho&s;e who approve &s;ending troops
to her relief, hold up their hands.&endq; The members unani|mou&s;ly
a&s;&s;enting, the a&s;&s;embly broke up; and twelve
hundred troops were commanded to march without a mo|ment's
delay. Before the clo&s;e of the evening Major Rihi|mer
entered Friburgh at the head of two hundred &s;oldiers,
who pa&s;&s;ed unmole&s;ted through flying parties of the in&s;ur|gents;
at midnight a hundred and fifty dragoons arrived,
and on the next morning eight hundred infantry completed
the reinforcement.</P>
<P>THE arrival of the&s;e troops in&s;pired the magi&s;trates of
Friburgh with perfect confidence and &s;ecurity, and &s;aved
<PB N="491" REF="519">
the town from the mo&s;t imminent danger. Neverthele&s;s the
emi&s;&s;aries of Chenaux and Ca&s;tellaz, ranging about the
country, &s;ounded the church bells in the various towns and
pari&s;hes, exclaiming that their religion and liberties were
threatened with immediate annihilation. The rebel forces
were continually augmenting; they began to be joined by
many inhabitants in the environs of the town; and the
lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;s would have increa&s;ed their number. Chenaux
had &s;everal emi&s;&s;aries within the city, and before mid-day
appeared before Friburgh at the head of above two thou|&s;and
men; eight hundred of whom were provided with
mu&s;kets, the remainder with only clubs, or the fir&s;t wea|pons
which chance pre&s;ented. Having occupied the
heights, he found his followers wavering and irre&s;olute, and
&s;truck with a general panic on receiving the news, that a
large body of troops from Berne had reinforced the garri&s;on.
He po&s;ted his followers however in an advantageous &s;itua|tion,
waiting with con&s;iderable anxiety till his forces &s;hould
be increa&s;ed, and an opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf of
commencing ho&s;tilities, or of obtaining a general amne&s;ty for
him&s;elf and his adherents.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation of affairs, Major Rihimer led a detach|ment
of a hundred and eighty dragoons from one of the
gates; while lieutenant Froideville, at the head of &s;eventy
foot and twenty dragoons, &s;allied from another. The Ma|jor,
driving the be&s;iegers from a height which commanded
the town, continued his march with an intent of attacking
them in front; and at the di&s;tance of about a cannon-&s;hot,
reconnoitred eight hundred of the enemy drawn up in order

of battle, but without artillery. The in&s;urgents no &s;ooner
ob&s;erved the cannon planted again&s;t them, and perceived
that the commander was an officer of Berne, than they di&s;|patched
repeated me&s;&s;engers to a&s;&s;ure him that they had no
ho&s;tile intentions; that they were only collected to petition
for a redre&s;s of grievances; and entreated him to &s;pare the
effu&s;ion of blood. Having received an an&s;wer, that he would
undertake to intercede in their behalf, if they would in|&s;tantly
lay down their arms, and deliver up Chenaux; they
agreed to the fir&s;t point, but refu&s;ed the &s;econd. The major
continued to enforce his demand, and gained time, until
lieutenant Froideville appeared unexpectedly in their rear.
The two commanders repeating their promi&s;es, that their
ju&s;t remon&s;trances &s;hould not be neglected, the whole troop
&s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners. Four of the principal
ringleaders being &s;ecured, the remainder, having delivered
in their names and places of abode, were permitted to retire
without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>CHENAUX, either finding it impo&s;&s;ible to excite his fol|lowers
to &s;u&s;tain the attack, or being deficient in per&s;onal
courage, was among the fir&s;t who betook them&s;elves to
flight. Wandering from village to village, he was, about
midnight, ob&s;erved near Po&s;ieux by Henry Ro&s;&s;ier, one of his
principal accomplices. Ro&s;&s;ier, willing to &s;ave his own life
by betraying his leader, &s;eized him by the collar, reproached
him for having &s;educed the people into rebellion, and for his
cowardice in for&s;aking them; and then, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Chavaillat and Python, two other in&s;urgents, took from
him a double-barrelled pi&s;tol, and was conducting him to
<PB N="493" REF="521">
Friburgh. Chenaux, however, &s;uddenly di&s;engaging him|&s;elf,
drew out a knife, and, wounding Ro&s;&s;ier in &s;everal
places, endeavoured to e&s;cape towards Po&s;ieux. But Cha|vaillat
pur&s;uing him, and Ro&s;&s;ier &s;natching a mu&s;ket from
one of his followers, &s;oon overtook him, and &s;ummoned him
to &s;urrender under pain of in&s;tant death. Chenaux, finding
no hopes of e&s;caping, and deriving courage from de&s;pair, at|tacked
Ro&s;&s;ier with &s;uch incon&s;iderate fury, that he received
the a&s;&s;ailant's bayonet in his brea&s;t, and expired on the &s;pot.
The death of the leader, the voluntary &s;urrender of his prin|cipal
a&s;&s;ociates, and the flight of Ca&s;tellaz, put an end to
this ill-concerted enterpri&s;e. Six hundred in&s;urgents, the
only remains of the rebels, were on the next morning
ob&s;erved hovering about the capital; but learning the fate
of their leader, and the &s;urrender of the other troops, and
being attacked by a corps of grenadiers, they di&s;per&s;ed
without re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT although the in&s;urrection was thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and
all parties had concurred in cha&s;ti&s;ing rebellion; yet the &s;pi|rit
of di&s;content had &s;pread it&s;elf with too great violence and
rapidity among all ranks of men, not to convince the rulers
of the &s;tate, that the &s;eeds of the revolt lay deeper than ap|pearances
&s;eemed to &s;ugge&s;t. For it was obvious, that the
petty vexations of bailifs, the abolition of unnece&s;&s;ary fa&s;ts and
fe&s;tivals, and the &s;eeming violation of a few trifling immuni|ties,
however exaggerated by the artifices of the mo&s;t de&s;ign|ing
leaders, could never have been &s;ufficiently powerful to
excite the people of Gruyeres to the de&s;perate extremity of
taking arms again&s;t their lawful &s;overeigns; had not go|vernment
<PB N="494" REF="522">
been extremely unpopular; if &s;everal grievances
of an oppre&s;&s;ive nature had not required to be redre&s;&s;ed;
&s;everal odious re&s;trictions to be removed; and &s;everal defects
in the con&s;titution to be remedied. Influenced by the&s;e
con&s;iderations, government, in a manife&s;to i&s;&s;ued on the
11th of May, after granting a general amne&s;ty to all the in|&s;urgents,
excepting a few of the ringleaders, found it nece&s;|&s;ary
to invite the &s;ubjects of all ranks and denominations to
pre&s;ent remon&s;trances, to make repre&s;entations, and to peti|tion
again&s;t grievances. About the &s;ame time the three
cantons of Berne, Lucerne, and Soleure di&s;patched deputies
to Friburgh, offering their mediation towards compo&s;ing the
di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the republic.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this manife&s;to, many petitions and re|mon&s;trances
were pre&s;ented to the great council, either
claiming the renewal of ob&s;olete rights, the removal of cer|tain
re&s;trictions, or the abolition of various taxes; demand|ing
redre&s;s of grievances, and an amendment of the con&s;titu|tion;
or complaining of an infringement of popular fran|chi&s;es.
As it would be needle&s;s to mention all the complaints
and plans of amendment which were dictated by the &s;pirit of
party and the frenzy of innovation, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to
three principal points of di&s;pute, which occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t
violent altercations; and which would never have been com|promi&s;ed,
unle&s;s the three mediating cantons had powerfully
and effectually interfered: 1. The di&s;qualification of the no|bility
from the office of bannerets and <HI>&s;ecrets;</HI> 2. The exorbi|tant
prerogatives and influence of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber;</HI> and
3 The exclu&s;ive privileges of the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burghers.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="523">
1. WITH re&s;pect to the fir&s;t point in agitation, it may be
remarked, that the exclu&s;ion of the noble families from the
charge of bannerets and of <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> appeared &s;ufficiently rea|&s;onable,
as long as the government was democratical, and
the bannerets were, according to the antient charters, cho|&s;en
from the people; and of cour&s;e when neither they, nor
their coadjutors, the <HI>&s;ecrets,</HI> could be taken from the no|bility.
But when the government was changed from a de|mocracy
to an ari&s;tocracy, and the municipal admini&s;tration
no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and particularly when the troubles
excited by the bannerets, in 1553, obliged the Council of
two hundred to transfer from the people to them&s;elves the
right of appointing tho&s;e magi&s;trates; the di&s;qualification of
the nobility, which was founded on democratical jealou&s;y,
ought to have no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. Their remon&s;trances
were therefore ju&s;t, and would have been &s;till more rea&s;on|able,
if the troubles of the republic had not rendered them
dangerous.</P>
<P>2. As to the &s;econd point in que&s;tion: the exten&s;ive
power and extraordinary influence of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber,</HI>
could not fail to create jealou&s;ies and di&s;contents among all
ranks of men. For, on con&s;idering the detail of their prero|gatives,
as laid down in the preceding letter, it mu&s;t appear,
that although the members of that committee enjoyed no
po&s;itive authority in enacting or annulling laws; yet by
being the depo&s;itaries of the con&s;titution, and the ultimate
framers of all decrees; by having the &s;ole right of propo&s;ing,
and a negative on all the re&s;olutions of the great council, no
motion could pa&s;s without their concurrence. It is al&s;o no
<PB N="496" REF="524">
le&s;s obvious, that the power of making regulations for the
interior admini&s;tration of their own affairs, my&s;teriou&s;ly con|cealed
from the knowledge of the Sovereign Council, might
give ri&s;e to dangerous abu&s;es; that the members of the
chamber eventually enjoyed, by the power of excluding
from all charges, that of nomination; that by appointing to
the vacancies in their own body it was to be feared, what in
effect happened, that an admi&s;&s;ion into the <HI>&s;ecret chamber</HI>
would be chiefly confined to a few families; that, as they
filled up all the elections in the Council of two hundred,
the&s;e elections would depend entirely upon a few per&s;ons
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t credit; and thus the government
would gradually but nece&s;&s;arily tend to a narrower oli|garchy.</P>
<P>3. THE third point in debate, namely, the exclu&s;ive pri|vileges
of the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burghers, opened a much larger and
more dangerous field of contention. The demand of the
other burghers, that, according to the antient form of govern|ment,
the right of being elected into the Great Council, and
con&s;equently a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of affairs, in&s;tead
of being exclu&s;ively confined to the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burghers, &s;hould
be al&s;o extended to them; &s;eemed to militate again&s;t the
fundamental laws of the republic, and to involve a total
change in the very e&s;&s;ence of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE remaining part of the year was employed in agitat|ing
the&s;e points of di&s;pute; which gave ri&s;e to many po|litical
and hi&s;torical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and occa&s;ioned &s;everal
curious re&s;earches into the origin of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber,</HI> and
<PB N="497" REF="525">
the ri&s;e of the di&s;tinction between the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> and other
burghers. For the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining the&s;e que&s;tions,
the popular party demanded acce&s;s to the archives; but
met with delays and refu&s;als on the part of government,
which con&s;idered &s;uch an inquiry as of dangerous ten|dency,
and calculated to introduce factious innovations in
the &s;tate.</P>
<P>EXASPERATED by repeated refu&s;als, the populace began
to &s;hew &s;igns of di&s;content, and to a&s;&s;emble in great crowds
at the place where Chenaux was put to death: they marched
in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, bearing cro&s;&s;es and colours, and
chaunting hymns and <HI>requiems</HI> in honour of this <HI>martyr</HI> (as
they called him) to the religion and liberties of his country.
The&s;e tumultuous meetings would probably have ended in
another in&s;urrection, if the bi&s;hop of Lau&s;anne had not for|bidden
them, under pain of excommunication. Towards
the conclu&s;ion of the year, the deputies from Berne,
Lucerne, and Soleure, arrived at Friburgh, for the purpo&s;e
of compo&s;ing the differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the capital. The&s;e
deputies, in order to conciliate the burghers, who were no
le&s;s violent in favour of the nobles than in extending their
own immunities, prevailed upon admini&s;tration to repeal the
di&s;abling clau&s;e. With re&s;pect, however, to the other &s;ub|jects
of controver&s;y; as they conceived it dangerous to entru&s;t
the leaders of a heated populace with the records of govern|ment,
which might be attended with projects of endle&s;s in|novation;
they propo&s;ed, that the Great Council &s;hould
order a committee to draw up a declaration &s;etting forth the
privileges and franchi&s;es of the burghers; and that for the
<PB N="498" REF="526">
future this declaration &s;hould be con&s;idered as a fundamen|tal
code. But although the&s;e e&s;&s;ential points were obtained,
yet &s;o many &s;ubjects of altercation &s;till remained, that for
&s;ome time all further plans towards finally compo&s;ing the
differences were fruitle&s;s. The deputies repaired to Morat,
where they were employed, from the 25th of April 1782 to
the 25th of July, in hearing appeals, revi&s;ing and con&s;ider|ing
the arguments on both &s;ides, and con&s;ulting on the
be&s;t methods to conciliate the two parties.</P>
<P>So greatly however were the burghers di&s;&s;atisfied with
the chiefs of the ari&s;tocracy, that they formed a re&s;olution to
refu&s;e taking the annual oath of allegiance to the Great
Council; nor were they without great difficulty prevailed
upon, by the three deputies in per&s;on (who repaired to
Friburgh for that purpo&s;e) to perform the u&s;ual homage.
Di&s;plea&s;ed, neverthele&s;s, with the deputies them&s;elves, and
con&s;idering them as too partial to admini&s;tration, they deli|vered
a memorial; in which, after repre&s;enting their griev|ances,
they threatened to appeal to the general diet of the
thirteen cantons a&s;&s;embled at Frauenfield.</P>
<P>A MEASURE of &s;o alarming a nature, and tending to pro|duce
a very material change in the principles of the Helve|tic
Union, was reprobated in the &s;tronge&s;t manner by the
members of that confederacy. For it was urged (and with
great rea&s;on) that by introducing an innovation of &s;uch
public notoriety, the di&s;putes between the re&s;pective govern|ments
and their &s;ubjects would be liable to become more nu|merous
and dangerous; and that in the end each canton
<PB N="499" REF="527">
would fall under the guardian&s;hip of the remainder. On
the other hand, what rendered the pre&s;ent cri&s;is of affairs
&s;till more alarming was, that the court of France, con&s;ulted
by &s;everal leading members in admini&s;tration, had offered
her good offices towards compo&s;ing the di&s;&s;entions. And
although the three cantons had, with con&s;i&s;tent dignity, de|clared
again&s;t the intervention of any foreign power, and
that Friburgh on accepting &s;uch a mediation, &s;hould be ex|cluded
from the Helvetic confederacy; yet it was to be ap|prehended,
that on an increa&s;e of the troubles, the French
would find &s;ome pretext to interfere in the affairs of Fri|burgh,
as they were actually engaged in tho&s;e of Geneva:
and &startq;woe upon that republic,&endq; &s;aid the a&s;&s;ertors of Swi&s;s
independence, &startq;in who&s;e internal politics foreign powers
interpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>INFLUENCED by the&s;e con&s;iderations, the three mediating
cantons, anxious to bring matters to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion,
prevailed upon the ruling party to con&s;ent to &s;everal altera|tions
in the con&s;titution. At length, after various delays,
di&s;putes, and conferences, the deputies publi&s;hed, on the
19th of June, a manife&s;to, declaring, that on an impartial
and diligent review of the various memorials and manife&s;tos
on both &s;ides, the a&s;&s;ertions of the burghers were groundle&s;s,
and their demands uncon&s;titutional; that the pre&s;ent form
of government had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted above two hundred years; and
that the &s;upreme authority re&s;ided in the members of the
Great Council. To this declaration they added, that the
three cantons would defend and protect the exi&s;ting form
of government, and would never permit an appeal relating
<PB N="500" REF="528">
to the amendment or alteration of the con&s;titution, to any
other power than the &s;upreme council of the republic, <HI>that</HI>
tribunal being alone competent to &s;uch que&s;tions. At the
&s;ame time they recommended to the government a repeal
of the di&s;abling clau&s;e, which excluded the nobility from
the office of banneret or <HI>&s;ecret;</HI> to admit &s;ome new fa|milies
into the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burgher&s;hip; to hear and redre&s;s any
remaining grievances; and to correct any defects in the
con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THIS declaration, being accepted by government, was
read, on the 28th of July, to the burghers a&s;&s;embled in their
re&s;pective tribes; but &s;everal among them prote&s;ting formally
again&s;t it, the three principal ringleaders of this oppo&s;ition
were bani&s;hed, their prote&s;ts di&s;regarded, and tranquillity was
re&s;tored to the republic. Soon after this final pacification, the
Great Council pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal acts for the redre&s;s of griev|ances,
removed &s;ome burdens and u&s;ages which had been
the object of general complaint, and amended the con&s;titu|tion
in the following points. 1. A perfect equality is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
between the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burghers; the antient nobles are
no longer di&s;qualified from holding the office of bannerets or
<HI>&s;ecrets,</HI> but do not enjoy any precedence in con&s;equence of
their titles, which in all acts and deeds within the canton of
Friburgh are omitted. In return, all the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burghers are,
without di&s;tinction of per&s;ons, e&s;teemed equally noble. 2. Six|teen
new families have been admitted into the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> burgh|er&s;hip,
which addition nearly completes the number of a
hundred families; and it is further enacted, that on the ex|tinction
of any three families, an equal number of families
<PB N="501" REF="529">
&s;hall be elected without delay. 3. The vacancies in the
&s;ixty, in&s;tead of being indi&s;criminately &s;upplied from the
members of the two hundred at large, are now filled up ac|cording
to &s;eniority. 4. But the great and principal altera|tion
in the form of government, re&s;pects the new con&s;titu|tion
of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber;</HI> which is changed in the follow|ing
important points.</P>
<P>1. THE members of that committee, in&s;tead of being no|minated
by a majority of voices in their own body, are now
taken from the &s;ixty, and cho&s;en by <HI>blind ballot.</HI> The candi|dates
are no longer under the nece&s;&s;ity of being pre&s;ented by
a member of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber;</HI> but, on addre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves
to their banneret, the latter is obliged to deliver in
their names to the <HI>&s;ecret chamber.</HI> As each vacancy is &s;up|plied
from the particular tribe in which it happens, this alter|ation
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily reduce the candidates to three or four:
in order, al&s;o, to prevent cabal or corruption, if there &s;hall be
only one candidate, he is not nece&s;&s;arily elected; but it mu&s;t
be decided by lot, whether he &s;hall be cho&s;en or rejected;
and if there &s;hould be a majority of ballots for the negative,
he mu&s;t wait till the &s;ub&s;equent year, before he can have
another chance of being appointed. Each member, on his
election, &s;hall pay no more than &pound;. 1. 10<HI>s.</HI> to each banneret
and <HI>&s;ecret;</HI> and the money &s;hall be delivered to the &s;ecretary,
and by him be equally di&s;tributed. 2. Neither father and
&s;on, nor two brothers, nor more than two per&s;ons bearing the
&s;ame name, &s;hall be admitted at the &s;ame time into the <HI>&s;ecret
chamber.</HI> 3. The members &s;till retain the right of &s;illing
up all the vacancies, in the Council of two hundred, with
<PB N="502" REF="530">
the u&s;ual provi&s;ions, that the candidates &s;hall be twenty
years of age; and that the promotion &s;hall take place every
two years. It is further decreed, that, on oath, under pain
of deprivation, no more, than 1200 crowns<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Of 25 bach each, the whole &s;um &pound;. 171. 13<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI></NOTE> &s;hall be received
for the nomination; and that the &s;aid &s;um, in&s;tead of being
&s;olely appropriated to the per&s;on who is to appoint, &s;hall now
be delivered to the &s;ecretary, to be by him equally di&s;|tributed
among the four bannerets, when either of them
&s;hall elect, or among the members of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber,</HI>
belonging to the tribe in which there is a vacancy, when the
turn devolves upon either of them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Each banneret to nominate the fir&s;t vacancy in his own tribe, and then each <HI>&s;ecret</HI> by rotation, according to &s;eniority, in his particular tribe.</NOTE>. It is moreover added,
that if the per&s;on pre&s;ented by a banneret, or a <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> &s;hall
be rejected by two-thirds of the chamber, another may be
pre&s;ented; but if the &s;econd is rejected, the right of pre|&s;entation
&s;hall be transferred to the banneret, or <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> next
in rank of the &s;ame tribe. It is al&s;o &s;tipulated on oath, that
all promi&s;es of exchanging pre&s;entations, or &s;imilar engage|ments,
&s;hall not be valid for the future; tho&s;e only except|ed,
which are now ab&s;olutely &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and which concern
either a &s;on of the contracting party, or a per&s;on who&s;e name
is &s;pecified. 4. The power of excluding per&s;ons from the prin|cipal
charges of government, is &s;till re&s;erved to them; but they
are exhorted to u&s;e it with great precaution and care. 5. The
interpo&s;ition of a negative, exerci&s;ed by a &s;ingle banneret, is
no longer &s;ufficient to reject a motion in the Great Council.
The oppo&s;ition, in order to render it valid, mu&s;t now be
&s;ounded on a preci&s;e law, and unanimou&s;ly approved by the
<PB N="503" REF="531">
four bannerets; but if one &s;hall di&s;&s;ent, it is then referred to
the Council of two hundred, which &s;hall decide, by a majo|rity
of two-thirds, whether the negative &s;hall be confirmed
or rejected. 6. The power of propo&s;ing, formerly ve&s;ted
only in the <HI>&s;ecret chamber,</HI> is now extended to the members
of the Little Council and the &s;ixty; and the mode of deli|berating
on &s;uch propo&s;itions and motions, is attended with
forms more or le&s;s complicated, as the object is more or le&s;s
important. In all in&s;tances the laws are prepared and finally
drawn up by the &s;ecret chamber. 7. The <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> &s;hall take
an oath before the bannerets as delegates of the Great Coun|cil,
to obey all the ordinances of that a&s;&s;embly, and to ob|&s;erve
the pre&s;ent articles, without retrenching or adding to
them. And it is further ordered, that no alterations &s;hall be
made in the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the <HI>&s;ecret chamber,</HI> unle&s;s
approved by three-fourths of their own body, and by two|thirds
of the Great Council.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 54.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CHEESE OF GRUYERES&mdash;HERMITAGE NEAR
FRIBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>THE canton of Friburgh contains a &s;mall portion of
arable land, but abounds in pa&s;tures; and, accord|ingly,
its principal articles of exportation con&s;i&s;t in horned
cattle, chee&s;e, butter, and hides.</P>
<P>THE chee&s;e, well known under the name of Gruyeres,
which is exported in &s;uch large quantities, is made in a
chain of mountains about ten leagues in length and four in
breadth, extending from the bailliage of Schwartzenburgh
to the di&s;tricts of Vevay and Aigle in the canton of Berne.
All the chee&s;es, though made in the &s;ame manner, are not of
the &s;ame quality; a difference probably ari&s;ing from the di|ver&s;ity
of the &s;oil, the &s;ame plants not groiwng at all heights;
and the lower pa&s;tures, called <HI>gites,</HI> not being in &s;uch high
e&s;timation for their goodne&s;s as tho&s;e in the mo&s;t ele|vated
&s;ituations.</P>
<P>THE whole di&s;trict is divided into greater or le&s;&s;er farms,
which the proprietors let out in lea&s;es of three or &s;ix years,
at the annual rate of 16 <HI>s.</HI> to &pound;. 1. 10 <HI>s.</HI> during five months
for each cow, according to the nature or elevation of the
ground: the lower pa&s;tures, though not of the be&s;t quality,
are the deare&s;t, becau&s;e being &s;ooner free from the &s;now,
<PB N="505" REF="533">
and later covered with it, they afford food to the cattle for a
longer time. Each farmer, having rented a mountain, hires
from the different pea&s;ants in the canton from forty to &s;ixty

at the rate of &pound;. 1. 6 <HI>s.</HI> to &pound;. 1. 13 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI> per head; and each
cow upon an average yields from twenty to twenty-four
quarts of milk per day, and &s;upplies two hundred pounds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Each pound contains &s;eventeen ounces and a fraction.</NOTE>
of chee&s;e during the five months. On the eighteenth of
October the farmer re&s;tores the cows to the different proprie|tors.
The cattle are then pa&s;tured in the meadows which
have been twice mowed, until the 10th or 11th of November,
when, on account of the &s;now, they are u&s;ually removed to
the &s;tables, and fed during winter on hay and after-gra&s;s.</P>
<P>As the mountains in the canton of Friburgh afford pa&s;|ture
for at lea&s;t 15,000 cows, it may be e&s;timated that they
annually &s;upply about 30,000 hundred weight of chee&s;e fit
for exportation; be&s;ide 2,000 or 3,000 after their return from
the mountains, exclu&s;ive of a thinner &s;ort, which is made in
various parts of the canton. The chee&s;es fit for exportation
weigh from forty to &s;ixty pounds each, and are &s;old from
&pound;. 1. 17 <HI>s.</HI> to &pound;. 2 per hundred weight. Be&s;ide the cows which
are pa&s;tured during &s;ummer in the mountains, the canton
contains about 12,000 belonging to the &s;everal landholders,
which &s;upply their families with milk. The buildings ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for making the chee&s;es con&s;i&s;t of a <HI>chalet</HI> or cottage,
which contains a room with a furnace for the purpo&s;e of
boiling the milk, a cellar where the milk is pre&s;erved, and a
<PB N="506" REF="534">
&s;table for &s;ixty or &s;eventy cows; near it is a kind of dairy-room,
kept in an equal degree of temperature, where the
chee&s;es are every day turned and &s;alted. The thickne&s;s of
the vat, in which each chee&s;e is pre&s;&s;ed, is about four
inches. The ca&s;ks for exportation contain ten chee&s;es, ex|cepting
tho&s;e de&s;tined for Italy, which hold only three, in
order to be conveyed by mules acro&s;s the Great St. Bernard.
The chee&s;es well packed up bear the tran&s;port into the mo&s;t
di&s;tant countries; they ought to be kept in a damp place,
and frequently wa&s;hed with white wine, for the purpo&s;e of
pre&s;erving them from in&s;ects. When the cows return from
the mountains, a &s;pecies of cream-chee&s;e is made in autumn,
and even in winter; it is much e&s;teemed, and is dearer than
that of Gruyeres.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of the &s;alt u&s;ed on the&s;e occa&s;ions is
drawn from Franche Comt&eacute;, a &s;mall quantity from Lorraine
and Bavaria, but its quality is much inferior. The con&s;ump|tion
of the whole canton, for all purpo&s;es, is at lea&s;t 20,000
hundred weight, of which 15,000 is drawn from Franche
Comt&eacute;. A great number of mares, foals, and horned cattle,
are annually rai&s;ed in the canton: the oxen of three or four
years old are &s;old in the canton of Berne, in the country of
Neuchatel, and in Franche Comt&eacute;. Upon an average it may
be e&s;timated that the canton of Friburgh &s;upplies pa&s;ture
for 37,000 cows and oxen.</P>
<P>IN our route to Berne, we made a &s;mall circuit to the vil|lage
of Neuneck, in order to &s;ee an hermitage, that lies
about a league from Friburgh; and which has been highly
<PB N="507" REF="535">
extolled by travellers on account of its &s;ingularity. It is
formed in the &s;olid rock; and the chief curio&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in
its having been the work of two men: as &s;uch, it is an a&s;to|ni&s;hing
performance, but, in any other re&s;pect, is &s;carcely
worth vi&s;iting. In the la&s;t century a hermit &s;cooped out a
hollow place in this rock, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to lie at his full
length: but his &s;ucce&s;&s;or de&s;iring a more commodious
man&s;ion, hewed, in the heart of the mountain, a chapel, &s;e|veral
apartments, and &s;tair-ca&s;es. The length of the whole
is above four hundred feet. One room is ninety feet long,
and twenty broad; the &s;teeple of the chapel, if it may be
&s;o called, is eighty feet high, and the chimney of the
kitchen ninety. The hermit who perforated this habitation
in the rock, was near thirty years engaged in the work.
What a wa&s;te of time and in&s;tu&s;try! But &s;uch is the folly of
&s;eque&s;tered &s;uper&s;tition, that, for want of more rational oc|cupations,
it frequently has recour&s;e to laborious trifles.
The &s;ituation of this hermitage is beautiful: the rock in
which it is cut, hangs over the river Sane, which meander|ing
between two chains of hills covered with wood, fills all
the valley beneath. The pre&s;ent hermit is a German; and
with him lives an old &s;oldier.</P>
<P>FROM this hermitage to Neuneck (at which place the
canton of Berne commences) the country is rich, and &s;inely
wooded; on our right we had a di&s;tant but &s;ublime view of
the mo&s;t rugged rocks, the &s;nowy alps ri&s;ing above them
and clo&s;ing the pro&s;pect. The &s;un was now declining: the
various tints of the evening&mdash;the purple gleam upon the
naked rocks&mdash;and the rays of the &s;etting-&s;un upon the gla|ciers,
<PB N="508" REF="536">
which &s;eemed to glow almo&s;t into tran&s;parency&mdash;ca&s;t
&s;uch a beautiful radiance over this magnificent &s;cene, as
even the luminous pencil of Apelles him&s;elf, who is &s;aid to
have painted <HI>&startq;quae pingi non po&s;&s;unt, fulgura &amp; fulgetra</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Plin. H. N. lib. 35. c. 10.</NOTE>,&endq;
would in vain have attempted to imitate.</P>
