<HEAD>Its SITUATION. EXTENT. DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>SCOTLAND, or North-Britain, lying be|tween the fifty-fourth and fifty-ninth degrees of North latitude, extends about two hun|dred and &s;eventy-eight miles in length, the breadth amounting in &s;ome places to near one hundred; containing an area of twenty-&s;even thou&s;and, &s;even hundred, ninety-four miles. To the &s;outh it borders upon England: on the north, ea&s;t, and we&s;t, it is wa&s;hed by the Deucaledonian, German, and Iri&s;h &s;eas. The fir&s;t and great divi|&s;ion of this country is that of di&s;tingui&s;hing be|tween the Lowlands and the Highlands, which were originally inhabited by two nations that widely differed from each other in language, garb, man|ners, cu&s;toms, and di&s;po&s;ition. The&s;e differences &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t; though the families of both are now intimately blended together, by means of tho&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="40">
alliances and marriages that in the cour&s;e of many hundred years mu&s;t have happened among peo|ple connected by mutual intere&s;t, and living un|der the &s;ame laws and government. Notwith|&s;tanding this communication, a national and ran|corous prejudice &s;till prevails between the High|landers and people of the Lowlands. The High|lands engro&s;s more than one half of Scotland; extending from Dumbarton&s;hire to the mo&s;t nor|thern part of the i&s;land, a &s;pace of two hundred miles in length, and in breadth from fifty to an hundred. This tract, however, includes &s;everal exten&s;ive di&s;tricts of low, fruitful ground, inha|bited by people who are in all re&s;pects different from the mountaineers. Nothing can be more &s;avage and horrendous to the eye of a &s;tranger, than the appearance of the Highlands, compo&s;ed of blue rocks and du&s;ky mountains, heaped upon one another even above the clouds, their inter|&s;tices rendered impa&s;&s;able by bogs, their &s;ides em|browned with heath, and their &s;ummits covered with &s;now, which lies all the year unthawed, pouring from their jagged &s;ides a thou&s;and tor|rents and roaring cataracts that fall into gloomy vales or glens below, &s;ome of them &s;o narrow, deep, and di&s;mal, as to be altogether impenetrable by the rays of the &s;un: yet even the&s;e mountains are in &s;ome places &s;loped into agreeable green hills fit for pa&s;ture, and &s;kirted or inter&s;per&s;ed with plea&s;ant traths or vallies capable of cultiva|tion. The mountaineers may &s;urely boa&s;t of their being unadulterated by any foreign mixture; whereas their neighbours are a &s;trange medley or Britons, Saxons, Danes, Norwegians, French, Engli&s;h, and Highlanders. It may be unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the Lowlanders of Scotland &s;peak an antient dialect of the Engli&s;h language, inter|larded with many terms and idioms which they
<PB N="3" REF="50">
borrowed immediately from France, in a long cour&s;e of corre&s;pondence with that kingdom: they likewi&s;e copy their &s;outhern neighbours in their hou&s;es, equipage, habit, indu&s;try, and appli|cation to commerce; while the Highlanders, for the mo&s;t part, retain their original ferocity, &s;loth, and martial di&s;dain of all lucrative employ|ments. Such are the differences that naturally appear between the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es: but the regu|lations of &s;ociety know no di&s;tinction. They are all comprehended under the name of Scots, go|verned by the &s;ame laws, and tried by the &s;ame judges; and whatever may be their di&s;&s;en&s;ions at home, they always, when abroad, acknowledge, and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another as friends and countrymen. Some authors have divided Scotland into that part which lies to the &s;outhward of the Frith, and that which lies to the northward: but the true divi&s;ion is like that of England into &s;hires, counties, &s;tewartries or bailiwicks, of which there are above forty within the kingdom of Scotland.</P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>The face of this country exhibits a very moun|tainous appearance, e&s;pecially to the we&s;t and northward: but, at the &s;ame time, it di&s;plays many large and long tracts of plain ground fit for all the purpo&s;es of agriculture. It is divided from ea&s;t to we&s;t by a chain of huge mountains, known by the name of Grants-Bain, or the Grampian Hills. There is another chain called the Pentland Hills, which run through Lothian, and join the mountains of Tweedale: a third, called Lammer Muir, ri&s;ing near the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, runs we&s;tward through the Mer&s;e: but be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a va&s;t number of detached hills and mountains re|markable for their &s;tupendous height and declivity.

There is no country in the world better &s;upplied than Scotland with rivers, lakes, rivulets, and fountains. Over and above the principal rivers of Tweed, Forth, Clyde, Tay, and Spey, there is an infinity of &s;maller &s;treams that contribute to the beauty, convenience, and advantage of the kingdom. Tweed takes its ri&s;e from the borders of Annandale; &s;erves as a boundary between Scot|land and England; and, after a long, &s;erpentine, cour&s;e, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea at Berwick. Forth, the large&s;t river in Scotland, ri&s;es in Mon|teith near Callendar, pa&s;&s;es by Stirling, and after a cour&s;e of five and twenty leagues, runs into thearm of the &s;ea called the Frith of Forth, which divides the coa&s;t of Lothian from Fife. Clyde takes its ri&s;e from Errick Hill, in the &s;hire of Lanerk, traver&s;es the &s;hire of Clyde&s;dale, to which it gives a name, wa&s;hes the city of Gla&s;gow, widens in its a&s;&s;age to the ca&s;tle of Dumbarton, and forms the Firth of Clyde adjoining to the Iri&s;h &s;ea. Tay, another large river, derives its &s;ource from Loch-Tay in Braidalbin, and after a &s;outh-ea&s;t cour&s;e, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea below Dundee. Spay, or Spey, i&s;&s;ues from a lake of the &s;ame name in Badenoch, and running a north-ea&s;terly cour&s;e, falls into the German ocean, near Aberdour. Some of the fre&s;h-water lakes are beautiful pieces of water incredibly deep, and &s;urprizingly ex|tended. There are &s;everal large fore&s;ts of fir in Scotland, and a great number of woods, which, however, produce very little timber of any con|&s;equence; but the country in general is bare of trees, and in many places neither tree, &s;hrub, nor any kind of plantation is to be &s;een. The ca&s;e has been otherwi&s;e of old; for huge trunks of trees are often dug from under-ground in almo&s;t every part of the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>AIR. CLIMATE. SOIL. WATER.</HEAD>
<P>In the North of Scotland, the day at Mid|&s;ummer is lengthened out to eighteen hours and five minutes; &s;o that the &s;horte&s;t night does not exceed five hours and forty-five minutes: the night and day, in winter, is long and &s;hort in the &s;ame proportion. The air of this kingdom is ge|nerally moi&s;t and temperate, except upon the tops of high mountains covered with eternal &s;now, where it is cold, keen, and piercing. In other parts it is tempered by warm vapours from the &s;ea, which environs it on three &s;ides, and runs far up into the land by friths, inlets, and indentations. This neighbourhood of the &s;ea, and the frequency of hills and mountains, produce a con&s;tant undu|lation in the air, and many hard gales, that purify the climate, which is for the mo&s;t part agreeable and healthy. Scotland affords a great variety of &s;oil in different parts of the country, which, being hilly, is in general be&s;t adapted to pa&s;turage: not, but that the Lowlands are as fertile, and if pro|perly inclo&s;ed and manured, would yield as good crops of wheat, as any grounds in the i&s;land of Great-Britain. The water in Scotland is remark|ably pure, light, and agreeable to the &s;tomach: but, over and above that which is u&s;ed for the ordinary purpo&s;es of life, here are many medi|cinal &s;prings of great note and wonderful efficacy, which &s;hall be de&s;cribed in the account of parti|cular places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: MINERAL, VEGETABLE, ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>Scotland abounds with quarries of free-&s;tone ea&s;ily worked, which enable the people to build
<PB N="6" REF="80">
elegant hou&s;es, both in town and country, at a &s;mall expence, e&s;pecially as they have plenty of lime &s;tone, and labour very cheap. The ea&s;t, we&s;t, and northern parts of the country produce excellent coal; and where this is wanting, the natives burn turf and peat for fuel: but there are &s;ome places where the poor people can find no other firing than cow-dung, which they care|fully dry and depo&s;it for this purpo&s;e; nay, for want of this convenience and comfort, they are often obliged in the winter to &s;it and &s;pin by the light of lamps in their cow-hou&s;es, which are kept warm by the breath and per&s;piration of their cattle. Chry&s;tals, variegated pebbles, and pre|cious &s;tones, are found in many parts of Scotland; talc, flint, and &s;ea-&s;hells, fuller's earth, potter's clay, and metals in great plenty. The country produces iron and copper ore, a prodigious quan|tity of lead mixed with a large proportion of &s;ilver; and in &s;ome places little bits of &s;olid gold are gathered in brooks immediately after torrents.</P>
<P>The Lowlands of Scotland, when duly culti|vated, yield rich harve&s;ts of wheat; and indeed it mu&s;t be owned that many parts of this king|dom rival the be&s;t &s;pots of England in agri|culture: but the&s;e improvements have not yet advanced into the we&s;tern and northern extremi|ties of the i&s;land, where we &s;ee nothing but &s;canty harve&s;ts of oats, rye, and barley. The Highlands are &s;o defective even in the&s;e, that they are fain to import &s;upplies of oatmeal from Ireland and Liverpool. This &s;carcity, however, we mu&s;t not impute to the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil, &s;o much as to the &s;loth and poverty of the tenants, oppre&s;&s;ed by rapacious landlords, who refu&s;e to grant &s;uch lea&s;es as would encourage the hu&s;band-man to improve his farm, and make him&s;elf bet|ter acquainted with the &s;cience of agriculture.
<PB N="7" REF="90">
This is perfectly well under&s;tood in the Lothians, where we &s;ee &s;ub&s;tantial inclo&s;ures, plantations, meadows for hay and pa&s;ture, wide extended fields of wheat, the fruits of &s;kill and indu&s;try, and meet with farmers who rent lands to the amount of four or five hundred pounds a year. Of plants, this country produces an immen&s;e variety, grow|ing wild in wood and vale, on rock and mountain, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e that are rai&s;ed by the hands of the hu&s;bandman and gardener, for food, phy&s;ic, ornament, and commerce. Their farm-grounds are well &s;tocked with wheat, rye, barley, oats, hemp, and flax: their gardens produce great plenty of kitchen-roots, &s;allads, and greens, among which la&s;t, we reckon the colewort, known by the name of Scotch-kail: their orchards bear a variety of apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, &s;trawberries, goo&s;eberries, ra&s;pberries, and currants: here al&s;o apricots, nectarines, peaches, and &s;ometimes grapes, are brought to maturity. In a word, there is no|thing, whether &s;hrub, fruit, or flower, that grows in any part of South-Britain, which may not, with a little pains, be brought to the &s;ame per|fection in the middle of Scotland. Among the trees and &s;hrubs which are the national growth of this country, we may reckon the oak, the fir, the birch, the poplar, the alder, willow, elder, hazle, mountain a&s;h, crab-tree, and juniper, which la&s;t abounds to &s;uch a degree in &s;ome parts of the Highlands, that in the &s;pace of a few miles, many tons of the berries might be yearly gathered: be|&s;ides the&s;e, we find the hawthorn, the &s;loe, the dog|ro&s;e, furze, broom, fern, and whole tracts of land and mountains covered with &s;trong heath. This affords &s;helter for the myrtillis, the fruit of which, called bilberries, is here found in great abundance, as well as the brambleberry, cranberry, and wild &s;trawberry. The a&s;h, the elm; the &s;ycamore,
<PB N="8" REF="100">
lime and walnut-tree, are chiefly planted about the hou&s;es of gentlemen; but even the inclo&s;ures of quick&s;et appear naked for want of &s;uch hedge|rows as adorn the country of England. Indeed, great part of this kingdom lies naked and expo&s;ed like a common; and other parts have no other enclo&s;ure than a paultry wall huddled up of loo&s;e &s;tones, which yields a bleak and mean pro&s;pect, and &s;erves no other purpo&s;e than that of keeping out the cattle. All the &s;ea coa&s;t is covered with alga marina, dul&s;e, and other marine plants, which we have mentioned in our de&s;cription of the We&s;tern I&s;les.</P>
<P>There we have particularized, too, all the animals which are found on the continent or main land of Scotland. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the Highlands are well &s;tocked with red deer, and the &s;maller &s;pecies called the roe|buck, as well as with hares, rabbits, foxes, wild cats, and badgers: that they abound with all &s;orts of game, and in particular with the grow&s;e and heathcock, which la&s;t is not &s;o frequent in other parts of the country. The two mo&s;t remarkable birds in the Highlands are the capperkaily, and the tarmacan: the fir&s;t is nearly as large as a turkey, frequents the mo&s;t high and remote hills, is &s;eldom &s;een, and counted a great rarity for the table. The tarmacan is a kind of phea&s;ant, about the &s;ize of the grow&s;e, which is here called moor-fowl, but of a lighter colour. It feeds upon the tender tops of the fir branches, from which the fle&s;h contracts a kind of turpentine flavour, ex|tremely agreeable both to the palate and &s;tomach: this bird is very &s;hy, and reckoned a great deli|cacy. The black-cock, or heath-cock, in &s;ize and plumage re&s;embles a phea&s;ant, but his colour is black and &s;hining: his mate, however, much more nearly re&s;embles a hen phea&s;ant, both in
<PB N="9" REF="110">
&s;hape and hue. The rivers and lakes pour forth a profu&s;ion of &s;almon, trout, jack, and eels: the &s;ea-coa&s;t &s;warms with all the productions of the ocean. The hills and mountains are covered with &s;heep and black cattle for exportation, as well as dome&s;tic u&s;e. The&s;e are of &s;mall &s;ize, as are al&s;o the hor&s;es bred in the Highlands; but the Low|landers u&s;e the large breed, which came originally from England.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE, their CHARACTER and PECULIARITIES.</HEAD>
<P>What we have &s;aid of the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the i&s;landers, may be applied to tho&s;e who in|habit the Highlands of Scotland. They are, in general, brave, pa&s;&s;ionate, and vindictive. The Lowlanders accu&s;e them of in&s;incerity, cruelty, and rapine: the Engli&s;h writers repre&s;ent them as in&s;ufferably proud, ridiculou&s;ly vain, and into|lerably na&s;ty. If the truth mu&s;t be owned, clean|line&s;s is a virtue very rarely found in this part of the world. Per&s;ons of education, fortune, and &s;entiment, ought to be exempted from this na|tional reproach. In the Low-country, the nobi|lity and gentry are &s;aid to be infected with the pride and in&s;olence of their Highland brethren: but, we apprehend, their character will be found nearly congenial with tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank and fortune in England and other countries. Perhaps they may be particular in cheri&s;hing a family|pride, inherited and &s;oothed from generation to generation, through a long &s;eries of progenitors. This pride, however, &s;eldom interferes with their avarice, when they are tempted with po&s;t or pen|&s;ion: the&s;e they are &s;aid to &s;ollicit with unwearied importunity, and to hold on the mo&s;t abject terms. The e&s;tates of the Scotti&s;h gentlemen being generally &s;mall and indivi&s;ible, the younger
<PB N="10" REF="120">
brothers commence adventurers, quit their own country, and pu&s;h their fortunes in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, which, both by land and &s;ea, abounds with Scotch officers: nay, they do not confine them&s;elves to Great-Britain, but travel over the face of the earth in the different capacities of &s;ol|diers, &s;ailors, merchants,, &s;cholars, phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, and apothecaries. They &s;warm in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, as well as upon the coa&s;t of Guiney. There is hardly a town in Europe, or even in A&s;ia, where we do not find &s;ome Scot&s;|man reputably &s;ettled. Hence aro&s;e the Engli&s;h proverb, that in every corner of the earth, one may find a Scot, a rat, and a Newca&s;tle grind|&s;tone. All the Scots are tinctured with learning, which, however &s;uperficial it may be, will always &s;hine in &s;ome places and in certain companies; and they know full well how to turn this commo|dity to the be&s;t advantage. They are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ober, indu&s;trious, circum&s;pect, &s;hrewd, and in&s;inuating, well aware of their intere&s;t, which in foreign countries they pro&s;ecute with per&s;everance and &s;ucce&s;s, even among people by whom they are envied and di&s;countenanced. Their enemies impute their pro&s;perity to their low cunning and &s;ervile adulation: but perhaps the&s;e reproaches flow from national prejudice, which knows not how to make proper di&s;tinctions. There is no creature upon earth le&s;s capable of flattery and di&s;&s;imulation, or more fiery and precipitate, than a Scot who piques him&s;elf upon his family: he is jealous in point of honour, even to a degree of being often offen&s;ive; but a man of the lower cla&s;s, who has been taught from his infancy to bridle his pa&s;&s;ions, to behave &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively to his &s;uperiors, and live within the bounds of the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, will, through the whole cour&s;e of his life, retain the colour of his education.
<PB N="11" REF="130">
He will not &s;wear, drink, and &s;wagger-like the common people of England: he will not &s;et his betters at defiance, nor commit any breach of law or decorum, which may in the &s;equel affect his per&s;on or his intere&s;t. On the contrary, he will &s;ave his money and his con&s;titution: he will pay due deference to tho&s;e whom fortune hath placed in a &s;uperior &s;phere: even when he thinks him&s;elf injured, he will rather devour his re&s;ent|ment, than gratify it at the hazard of lo&s;ing a friend or employer. Truth will own, that there are no better &s;oldiers, &s;eamen, traders, and trade&s;|men, than tho&s;e whom Scotland has produced; and that with re&s;pect to learning and genius, this people is not behind any other nation in Europe. After all, we cannot deny that the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline which prevails among the people of Scotland, and is maintained even to a degree of oppre&s;&s;ion, under pretence of diffu&s;ing &s;uperior &s;anctity, may di&s;po&s;e them to hypocri&s;y, and of con&s;equence to fraud. The commonalty of Scot|land are mo&s;tly raw-boned, hard-featured, lean, lank, and mu&s;cular. In &s;ize they are rather &s;maller than their neighbours of South-Britain: they have generally long vi&s;ages, with high-cheek bones, and hair of a &s;andy, red colour. They po&s;&s;e&s;s an aequanimity above mo&s;t other nations, and enjoy good health, which is the immediate effect of a &s;alubrious air and temperate diet. They are clothed after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, with this differ|ence, that the pea&s;ants, in&s;tead of hats, wear flat blue caps, which they call bonnets; be&s;ides, their apparel is neither &s;o good nor &s;o clean as that worn by the people of the &s;ame rank on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Tweed. They dwell in wretched cot|tages built of loo&s;e &s;tones, without lime or mor|tar, and thatched with &s;traw: they feed on oat|meal, milk, chee&s;e, &s;owens, which is a kind of
<PB N="12" REF="140">
&s;lummery made of oatmeal, and a &s;ort of &s;oup|meagre compo&s;ed of greens, roots, oatmeal, and butter. Some of them do not ta&s;te butcher's meat three times in the year: every family, how|ever, in tolerable circum&s;tances, kills a cow at Martinma&s;s, and keeps the meat in pickle, to be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally in barley-broth, or eaten boiled with greens. The Scots value them&s;elves upon being as original in their cookery as in their mu|&s;ick: for their di&s;hes are widely different from tho&s;e of any other country. Of the&s;e, the prin|cipal are the hoggice, the hodge-podge, the &s;heep's-head &s;inged, the fi&s;h in &s;auce, the chicken broth, and minced collops. The hoggice is a hint taken from Apicius, a kind of hachis made of the lights, liver, and &s;uet of a hog, &s;ea&s;oned, &s;auced, and boiled in the animal's &s;tomach, &s;o that when it appears upon the table, it looks like a bagpipe blown up with wind. The Scots have an aver&s;ion to hog-fle&s;h, and therefore &s;ub&s;titute the lights and liver of a &s;heep, though they &s;till re|tain the name of haggice: this, when well com|pounded, is counted a &s;avoury di&s;h, but rather too &s;trong for any ordinary dige&s;tion. Hodge|podge is a &s;uccedaneum for the Spani&s;h olla|podrida, and may be termed a rich &s;oup, com|po&s;ed of beef, mutton, fowl, &s;tewed with rice or barley, green pea&s;e, lettuce, turnips, carrots and onions. In &s;uch a pottage they very often boil a &s;heep's head and feet, with the &s;kin &s;inged &s;mooth with a red-hot iron: this operation gives it a very high flavour, which, though it would turn the &s;tomach of an Engli&s;hman, has been admired by &s;ome foreigners accu&s;tomed to the fumet. Fi&s;h in &s;auce, is a kind of &s;oup made with haddocks, or other fi&s;h, the heads being &s;tuffed with forced-meat. Chicken broth is a very &s;imple preparation, en|riched with eggs in &s;uch a manner, as to give it
<PB N="13" REF="150">
the air of a &s;poiled frica&s;ee: notwith&s;tanding this appearance, it is very delicate and nouri&s;hing. Minced collops are made of the rump of beef and &s;uet, cut very &s;mall, &s;ea&s;oned with pepper, &s;pice, and vinegar, par-boiled, and kept clo&s;e in a jar, to be fried occa&s;ionally for the table. In fa&s;hion|able hou&s;es, the&s;e di&s;hes are now produced rather as curio&s;ities than cates, the French cookery pre|vailing univer&s;ally among the great: but the peo|ple of middle rank &s;till retain their old dainties, though they are &s;aid to dre&s;s them in a very dirty, &s;lovenly manner. The oatmeal, which the com|mon people con&s;ume in bread, is ground in wa|ter-mills, except in the Highlands, where the&s;e conveniencies are very &s;carce: there, as well as in the i&s;lands, the good women grind their corn in what they call a querne, con&s;i&s;ting of two round &s;mooth &s;tones; one hollowed, and fixed for the reception of the other, which being turned round upon a wooden peg that &s;tands up from the infe|rior &s;tone, and goes through a hole in the &s;upe|rior, brays the corn into a coar&s;e powder: the meal being winnowed and &s;ifted, is converted into dough, and formed into broad, thin, triangular cakes, which are fir&s;t baked over the fire on a thin plate of ca&s;t iron, which the Scots term a girdle, and afterwards toa&s;ted, until they become cri&s;p and fit for eating. This is the only bread u&s;ed by the commonalty of Scotland, except in the principal towns, where they eat very good wheaten loaves. The Scotch mechanicks are counted neat workmen; and this country has pro|duced many &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of natural genius among the &s;hepherds and pea&s;antry. The&s;e peo|ple are addicted to rhiming; and &s;o fond of mu|&s;ick, that one can hardly meet with an individual who cannot play upon &s;ome in&s;trument; but their voices are generally har&s;h or hu&s;ky. They value
<PB N="14" REF="160">
them&s;elves much on their tunes, which are cele|brated all over Europe for their melody, &s;implicity, and tenderne&s;s. Other nations alledge, that they owe all tho&s;e pieces to the famous David Riccio, who was murdered in the apartment of the unfor|tunate queen Mary; but the antiquaries of Scot|land undertake to prove, that their be&s;t tunes are of a much older &s;tanding: certain it is, they are wonderfully &s;weet, expre&s;&s;ive, and affecting. The gentlemen of Scotland are &s;tigmatized for hard drinkers; and the kingdom con&s;umes annually a great quantity of French claret, which is &s;old at a very rea&s;onable rate. The zealous patriots of the country have renounced this liquor; and, in order to encourage the Briti&s;h plantations, commit all their debauches with rum punch; a compo|&s;ition of water, lemon-juice, &s;ugar, and the &s;pirit called rum, di&s;tilled from the refu&s;e of the &s;ugar|canes and mola&s;&s;es. The hou&s;ekeepers and publi|cans brew excellent beer and ale in many parts of Scotland: but the common people, who cannot afford &s;uch beverage, make merry on whi&s;ky and two-penny, which la&s;t is a &s;ort of &s;mall ale &s;old for one penny the quart. Cheared by this liquor, and animated with a Scotch jigg from a fiddle or bagpipe, the country lads and la&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;embling at a wedding, fair, or market, dance all day with great activity and glee, being to all appearance much more happy than tho&s;e who contemplate their poverty with contempt. The better &s;ort of people are extremely fond of country-dances, which they perform with uncommon vivacity. The other diver&s;ions prevalent in the Lowlands are tennis, fives, goff <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goff is a game at ball, played on an open common, like cricket; but the ball is much harder, and in&s;tead of bats, they u&s;e clubs faced with horn.

The weddings of the common people in Scotland are celebrated with the firing of guns and pi&s;tols, while the new|married couple return from church: then they fea&s;t at dinner with the gue&s;ts. All the company ri&s;e up to dance in &s;eparate bands, to the &s;ound of fiddles and bagpipes, in hou&s;es, barns, and even on the gra&s;s, to the number of &s;ome hun|dreds. The evening is generally concluded with drinking and debauchery. The practice is not much different at funerals: the corp&s;e is carried on a bier, by the neare&s;t relations, to the grave, where it is depo&s;ited, without any other ceremony than that of hat-lifting, when du&s;t is committed to du&s;t: the company return to the hou&s;e of the defunct, and drown their &s;orrow in a deluge of drinking. Among people of fa&s;hion, before the corp&s;e is taken up, the company are &s;erved round with a gla&s;s of wine, &s;weet cakes, and with almonds and rai&s;ins, with which every gue&s;t generally fills his pocket. To accompany the funerals of poor per&s;ons, their neighbours are &s;ummoned by a di&s;|mal pa&s;&s;ing bell, rung by the beadle, who halts in certain places of the &s;treet, and in &s;olemn phra&s;e and melancholy tone, announces the name and profe&s;&s;ion of the defunct, with the time fixed for his burial. Tho&s;e of a higher rank are in|vited by printed letters, &s;igned by the next of kin to the decea&s;ed. At Highland funerals, the company, both before and after the interment, are cheared with the mu&s;ick of the bagpipe, which is garni&s;hed with long &s;tripes of black crape, and

<HEAD>RELIGION. LAWS. GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The prevailing religion in Scotland is Calvini&s;m, or that of the Kirk, imported thither by the re|former, John Knox, from Geneva. This di&s;|cipline, after a long &s;truggle with epi&s;copacy, was at length &s;ettled as the national church; though there is &s;till a great number of all ranks who adhere to the religion of England, and a few &s;till retain the Roman catholic faith. The kirk is governed by the general a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of the dergy, intermingled with a certain number of laymen, called ruling elders, deputed from each pre&s;bytery: the&s;e are annually convened at Edin|burgh by the King's commi&s;&s;ion, ve&s;ted in &s;ome Scotti&s;h nobleman, who pre&s;ides in the a&s;&s;embly, and appears with great &s;plendour, as the repre|&s;entative of his &s;overeign, being &s;upplied by the crown with a gratuity, which very well enables him to maintain this magnificence. The a&s;&s;embly e&s;tabli&s;hes regulations in the church, and reforms abu&s;es, depo&s;ing tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics who have di&s;|graced the prie&s;thood by their loo&s;e morals and irregularities, and affirming or rever&s;ing the &s;en|tences pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ynods and pre&s;byteries, which are &s;ubordinate courts of church judicature. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that the&s;e judicatories have no power over the laity, as they have in other countries: all the authority they can exert, is to publi&s;h the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t fornicators or adulterers, provided they refu&s;e to do public penance: <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">A convicted fornicator is required to &s;tand upon the black &s;tool of repentance, three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Sundays, and be &s;olemnly rebuked by the mini&s;ter in the face of the congregation. Adulterers are obliged to &s;tand in a white &s;heet, or &s;ack-cloth, at the church door: but in the great towns, this penance is com|muted for a &s;um of money payed to the Kirk-trea&s;urer. The di&s;grace of doing public penance is &s;o dreaded by the common people, that in order to avoid the black-&s;tool, the fruit of an illicit amour is not unfrequently murdered in the birth by the de&s;perate mother, and &s;he afterwards ends her life with infamy upon the gallows.</NOTE> but this &s;entence
<PB N="17" REF="190">
is not attended with outlawry, or any other con|&s;equence than the di&s;grace which it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily leave on the character of the per&s;on &s;o cen|&s;ured. Though there is no benefice in Scotland that exceeds one hundred and fifty pounds a year, the &s;malle&s;t is &s;ufficient to maintain the incumbent in a decent manner; and there is a provi&s;ion made by law for the widows of poor clergymen. The clergy of Scotland, in order to pre&s;erve their in|fluence among the people, have affected an un|common au&s;terity in their manners and way of living, and even impo&s;ed it, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the laity of their communion, who may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by their mortified looks, their canting conver&s;ation, and their profe&s;&s;ed aver&s;ion to the amu&s;ements and vanities of life: we &s;peak of tho&s;e who are really religioni&s;ts. This univer|&s;al affectation of &s;anctity, is attended with &s;ome good con&s;equences to &s;ociety. It re&s;trains the pa&s;&s;ions within the limits of decorum, and pre|vents tho&s;e riots, indecencies, and avowed con|tempt of religion, which prevail &s;o openly in England, to the di&s;grace of all order and police. There are no people under the &s;un more decent and orderly than the Scots in their own country. At the Revolution, a great number of ignorant fanatics were admitted to ordination in the church of Scotland; and the&s;e acquired wonderful influ|ence with the vulgar, by long prayers and extem|pore &s;ermons, delivered through the no&s;e with the &s;anctified twang, which had an air of in&s;piration.
<PB N="18" REF="200">
Nothing could be more impertinent, tire&s;ome, and ab&s;urd than tho&s;e effu&s;ions, which, among per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and education, &s;oon brought the prie&s;thood into ridicule and contempt. This old remnant of fanatics is now almo&s;t worn out, and generally &s;ucceeded by a &s;et of mini&s;ters, who, by their learning, ta&s;te, and liberal &s;entiments, would do honour to any religion: neverthele&s;s, there is a &s;ort of &s;chi&s;m in the kirk, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome of the old leaven of fanatici&s;m. Divers pa&s;tors have revolted again&s;t temporal &s;upremacy and lay-patronage: they have &s;et up a new light, in oppo&s;ition to the light of rea&s;on, and faith again&s;t good works, which they treat as an abo|mination. In a word, they have plunged head|long into all the extravagancies of puritanical en|thu&s;ia&s;m; and though removed from their livings, as &s;chi&s;matics, by the power of the general a&s;&s;em|bly, they have been followed by the greater part of their flocks, who obey them implicitly, pro|vide amply for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and build meet|ing-hou&s;es for the celebration of their wor&s;hip. At pre&s;ent there are in Scotland thirteen provin|cial &s;ynods, that meet twice a year, and about &s;ixty-eight pre&s;byteries, con&s;i&s;ting each of a num|ber of mini&s;ters, from twelve to twenty: the lowe&s;t church judicature is the kirk &s;e&s;&s;ion of every pari&s;h, compo&s;ed of the mini&s;ter and cer|tain elders, cho&s;en from the mo&s;t reputable of his pari&s;hioners. A &s;ociety was incorporated by pa|tent, in the reign of queen Anne, for erecting &s;chools in North-Britain and the We&s;tern I&s;les. This was afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parlia|ment, and a fund appropriated for carrying the de&s;ign into execution: to this fund his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty adds a thou&s;and pounds per annum.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="210">
throughout every part of the country, in which children are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and even the cla&s;&s;ics, at a very &s;mall expence. The Scots in general are &s;uper&s;titious: they tru&s;t in charms and incantations: they believe every old hou&s;e is haunted by gho&s;ts and &s;pirits: they imagine they &s;ee apparitions, and hear &s;upernatural &s;ounds; and univer&s;ally adopt the notion of witch|craft: a poor, old, lone woman, who lives in a &s;olitary hut, and appears with wrinkled face, hol|low eyes, and a red petticoat, ever incurs the &s;u|&s;picion of &s;orcery; and even in our own times, &s;everal mi&s;erable wretches have been legally con|demned, and &s;uffered death for witchcraft, who had no other guilt than poverty and de&s;pair. The&s;e cruel and ab&s;urd laws, however, have been happily repealed by the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature. The education of tho&s;e de&s;igned for the learned pro|fe&s;&s;ions, is perfected at the four univer&s;ities of Edinburgh, Gla&s;gow, Aberdeen, and St. Andrews, which are &s;eminaries tolerably endowed, and well &s;upplied with excellent profe&s;&s;ors. Ju&s;tice is like|wi&s;e admini&s;tered in towns, according to the mu|nicipal laws, by the magi&s;trates of the corpora|tion. Every royal borough con&s;i&s;ts of a provo&s;t or mayor, two bailiffs, a trea&s;urer, and dean of guild, which la&s;t regulates all affairs of commerce. The magi&s;trates are cho&s;en annually by the town, or common-council; and every company, at the &s;ame time, chu&s;es a deacon to decide petty di&s;|putes that may happen among them&s;elves. Capi|tal crimes in Scotland are puni&s;hed by hanging, except high-trea&s;on in noblemen, who are gene|rally indulged with decapitation. For this pur|po&s;e, the Scots have contrived a machine, called the Maiden, which is a &s;harp plate of iron, that de&s;cends through a groove in a frame upon the neck of the malefactor, with &s;uch force and velo|city,
<PB N="20" REF="220">
that the head is in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;evered from the body. A criminal condemned to be hanged walks in his &s;hroud, with a halter about his neck, accompanied by two mini&s;ters, the town magi|&s;trates, and a va&s;t crowd, to the gallows, which he and the executioner a&s;cend by a double ladder. There they &s;tand, until the &s;ervice of p&s;alm|&s;inging and praying is performed by the mini&s;ters on a &s;caffold below: then the malefactor addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in a &s;peech to the &s;pectators; the execu|tioner adju&s;ts the halter to the end of the gibbet, ties a handkerchief about the victim's face, and pu&s;hing him off the ladder, he is immediately &s;trangled by the weight of his own body.</P>
<P>The Scots are governed by their own laws, de|duced partly from the feudal &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, and partly built on the civil law, and the law of nature and nations. The courts of judi|cature are the&s;e: the college of ju&s;tice, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen judges, called lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, who &s;it twice a year to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice according to equity, and determine cau&s;es appealed to them from inferior tribunals; yet even from this, there lies an appeal to the Briti&s;h parliament. The ju&s;tice court for cau&s;es, criminal and civil, con|&s;i&s;ts of a ju&s;tice-general, ju&s;tice-clerk, and five other judges, who are lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a jury or pannel of fifteen, try and decide all cau&s;es by a majority of the pannel, and hold a&s;&s;izes yearly in all parts of the kingdom. The court of exchequer, regulated by act of par|liament, after the model of that in England. The &s;heriff's county-court, in which he or his deputy pre&s;ides, and admini&s;ters ju&s;tice in all ca&s;es, civil and criminal. The&s;e &s;heriffs were formerly here|ditary; but the Briti&s;h parliament, having com|pounded with them for &s;ums of money, lately aboli&s;hed tho&s;e juri&s;dictions, which were produc|tive
<PB N="21" REF="230">
of much oppre&s;&s;ion and undue influence; and now the &s;heriffs are appointed by the crown. The commi&s;&s;ary-court, compo&s;ed of four judges, who &s;it at Edinburgh, and determine all di&s;putes about marriages, wills, and tythes, and all ca&s;es of &s;can|dal. Be&s;ides the&s;e tribunals, Scotland is provided with ju&s;tices of the peace, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame power which is ve&s;ted in tho&s;e of England. There is likewi&s;e a court of admiralty, which not only takes cognizance of wrecks, and all matters re|lating to the &s;ea; but likewi&s;e grants writs of ar|re&s;t, called <HI>intentione fugae,</HI> again&s;t &s;uch debtors or delinquents as are &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to leave the kingdom. There are three &s;orts of burghs or burroughs, namely, burghs royal, burghs of re|gality, and burghs of barony. The royal bur|roughs form one body and general court, called, the convention of burroughs, held annually at Edinburgh, to make regulations, and take cogni|zance of all matters relating to the trade and inte|re&s;t of the community. Regalities are feus granted by the king to particular &s;ubjects or corporations, with very exten&s;ive authority and juri&s;diction in ca&s;es criminal, as well as civil. Burghs of barony, holding of the crown, enjoy a court of juri&s;dic|tion, wherein &s;mall cau&s;es are tried; but the royal burroughs only have the privilege of &s;end|ing members to parliament. The con&s;titution of Scotland has varied, at different times, according as the power of the king, the nobles, or the com|mons happened to prevail; at la&s;t, however, it &s;ettled in a limited monarchy. The Scots enjoyed their own parliament, con&s;i&s;ting of king, lords, and commons, though differently modelled from that of England; but the two nations being incor|porated by the act of union, the Scotti&s;h parlia|ment cea&s;ed of cour&s;e, and the kingdom is now repre&s;ented by &s;ixteen peers, and forty-five com|moners,
<PB N="22" REF="240">
who &s;it and vote in the Briti&s;h parliament. The&s;e peers are elected every parliament from the whole body of the Scotch nobility; and the com|mons are cho&s;en by the &s;hires and certain burroughs cla&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. The land-tax of Scot|land is &s;ettled at a certain &s;um, by an article of the treaty of union; but the cu&s;toms, and other branches of the revenue, are on the &s;ame footing here as in England. The great offices of the crown are &s;till maintained and be&s;towed upon the noblemen of North-Britain The order of knighthood peculiar to Scotland is called that of the Thi&s;tle, con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;overeign and twelve knights. They wear a green ribbon over their &s;houlder, and on their brea&s;t an embroidered &s;tar, repre&s;enting St. Andrew irradiated, with the in|&s;cription, <HI>nemo me impune lace&s;&s;it.</HI> This order is &s;aid to have been originally in&s;tituted by king Achaius in the eighth century. It was revived by James V. a prince of great ta&s;te and magnificence, but dropped about the time of the Reformation, and was again re&s;tored to its former lu&s;tre by queen Anne. The armorial bearing of Scotland is &s;ol, a lion rampant gules, within a double tre&s;&s;ure flowered and counterflowered; the cre&s;t, a lion crowned imperial.</P>

<HEAD>STRENGTH, MANUFACTURE, and COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ecurity of Scotland, as well as of the whole i&s;land, depends chiefly on the naval power and &s;tanding army of Great-Britain. In order to pre&s;erve the tranquillity of North-Britain, which has been very much &s;ubject to commotions within, and inva&s;ions from without, there is always a con|&s;iderable body of troops quartered in this country: here are &s;everal old ca&s;tles garri&s;oned with invalids; and &s;ome modern fortifications in the Highlands,
<PB N="23" REF="250">
which are always kept in repair, and well guarded both with men and artillery. The remarkable edi|fices and monuments of antiquity belonging to this kingdom, &s;hall be &s;pecified in our accounts of particular places.</P>
<P>A remarkable &s;pirit of indu&s;try has of late years appeared very vi&s;ibly in many parts of Scot|land. We have already ob&s;erved how much agri|culture hath been improved in the Lothians, and on all the ea&s;tern coa&s;t: nor have the Scots been more remi&s;s in the article of manufacture. That of their linen, which the government encourages with a bounty and premiums, hath encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that, exclu&s;ive of home con&s;ump|tion, they export to England and the Briti&s;h plan|tations, in linens, cambricks, checks, O&s;nabrugs, inkle, and other articles of the &s;ame branch, to the amount of four hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling yearly. Though their wool be generally coar&s;e, yet it &s;erves very well for cloathing to the common people; and when mixed with a propor|tion of Engli&s;h wool, or that produced by &s;heep of the Engli&s;h breed, may be &s;pun, woven, and dre&s;&s;ed into excellent broad-cloth, of which there are &s;ome con&s;iderable manufactories in different parts of Scotland. Of their wool, they likewi&s;e make caps, &s;tockings, and mittins for exportation. The mountains of Scotland produce a great quantity of lead and &s;ilver, by which the community is en|riched, and a va&s;t number of hands employed; but the fi&s;hery may be &s;aid to be the inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure of this country. We have already en|larged upon this &s;ubject, in our de&s;cription of the i&s;les, though it cannot be too much recommended to the attention of the&s;e people: we &s;hall only ob|&s;erve at pre&s;ent, that the improvement of the fi&s;hery is the more practicable, as plenty of &s;alt may be had for curing them on every part of the
<PB N="24" REF="260">
coa&s;t. Salt-pans are already erected in many dif|ferent places, and the &s;ea-water is boiled with all the &s;ucce&s;s that could be expected; nor would it be difficult, we apprehend, to make bay-&s;alt, by overflowing low grounds on the &s;ea-&s;ide. The cod, ling, and herring-fi&s;hery is already carried on to a con&s;iderable extent; and the cured fi&s;h ex|ported to Spain, Portugal, and the plantations, where they are preferred to the produce of New|foundland. They moreover equip an annual fleet of &s;hips for the whale-fi&s;hery, on the coa&s;t of Spitzbergen; and have, on the whole, made pro&s;|perous voyages: indeed, they could hardly prove otherwi&s;e, as the government allows a bounty of forty &s;hillings for every ton of &s;hipping thus em|ployed. Another con&s;iderable branch of traffic is the &s;ale of black cattle, which the Scots drive up annually to England, in thou&s;ands. The&s;e, be|ing fattened in the rich pa&s;tures of South-Britain, are &s;laughtered for the market, and the beef is counted delicious. The Scots carry on a profitable foreign trade to the Briti&s;h plantations, where they exchange their own manufactures for &s;ugar, rum, and tobacco, as well as to other countries on the continent, where they di&s;po&s;e of their fi&s;h, tallow, hides, and woollen manufacture. In a word, this kingdom, though branded with the reproach of poverty and barrenne&s;s, might prove an inex|hau&s;tible &s;ource of wealth to the natives. It is almo&s;t &s;urrounded with an open ocean, provided with a great number of excellent harbours, occu|pied by a race of hardy people, rich in many na|tural advantages, and every way adapted for com|merce. The inhabitants &s;eem at length acquainted with their own intere&s;t: they under&s;tand the na|ture of commerce: they &s;ee the happy effects of indu&s;try: they take example by their &s;outhern neighbours and fellow &s;ubjects, and pur&s;ue their

<P>Scotland is divided into thirty-three &s;hires, namely, Edinburgh, Haddington, Berwick, Rox|borough, Selkirk, Peebles, Lanerk, Dumfries, Wigtown, Aire, Dumbarton, Bute, Caithne&s;s, Renfrew, Stirling, Linlithgow, Perth, Kincardin, Aberdeen, Inverne&s;s, Nairn, Cromartie, Argyle, Fife, Forfar, Bamff, Kircudbright, Sutherland, Clackmanan, Kinro&s;s, Ro&s;s, Elgin, Orkney. The&s;e we &s;hall &s;eparately de&s;cribe, proceeding in our u&s;ual cour&s;e, from the north to the &s;outhward of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Caithne&s;s, otherwi&s;e called the &s;hire of Weick, is the mo&s;t northern county of all Scotland; bounded on the ea&s;t by the ocean, by Strathnaver and Sutherland on the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t: from the&s;e it is divided by the mountain Orde, and a continued ridge of hills as far as Knockfin, then by the whole cour&s;e of the river Hallowdale. On the north it is wa&s;hed by the Pentland, or Put|land Firth, which flows between this county and the Orkneys. It extends five and thirty miles from north to &s;outh, and about twenty from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The coa&s;t is rocky, and remarkable for a number of bays and promontories. Of the&s;e, the principal are Sand-&s;ide-Head to the we&s;t, pointing to the opening of Pentland Frith; Orcas, now Holborn-Head, and Dunnot-Head, both fronting northward to the Frith. Dunnot-Head is a penin&s;ula about a mile broad, and &s;even in compa&s;s; affording &s;everal lakes, good pa&s;ture, excellent mill-&s;tones, and a lead-mine. Scribi&s;ter|bay, on the north-we&s;t, is a good harbour, where &s;hips may ride &s;ecurely. Rice bay, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, extends three miles in breadth, but is of dangerous acce&s;s, on account of &s;ome &s;unk rocks at the entrance. At the bottom of this bay ap|pear
<PB N="26" REF="280">
the ruins of two &s;trong ca&s;tles, the &s;eat of the earl of Caithne&s;s, called Ca&s;tle Sinclair, and Gernego, joined to each other by a draw-bridge. Duncan's bay, otherwi&s;e called Dun&s;by head, the north-ea&s;t point of Caithne&s;s, and the extreme&s;t promontory in Britain. At this place, the breadth of the Frith does not exceed twelve miles, and in the neighbourhood is the ordinary ferry to the Ork|neys. Here is likewi&s;e Clythene&s;s pointing ea&s;t, and No&s;head pointing north-ea&s;t. The &s;ea in this place is very impetuous, being in continual agita|tion from violent counter-tides, currents, and vor|tices. The only i&s;land belonging to this county is that of Stroma, in the Pentland Frith, at the di&s;tance of two miles from the main land, extend|ing about a mile in length, and producing good corn. The navigation is here rendered very diffi|cult by conflicting tides and currents, which at both ends of the i&s;land produce a great agitation in the &s;ea. At the &s;outh end, the waves dance &s;o impetuou&s;ly, that the &s;ailors term them the <HI>merry men of May,</HI> alluding to the hou&s;e of one Mr. May, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of Caithne&s;s, which &s;erved them as a land-mark, in the dangerous pa&s;&s;age between the i&s;land and the continent. The property of this i&s;land was once di&s;puted between the earls of Orkney and Caithne&s;s; but adjudged to the latter, in con&s;equence of an experiment, by which it appeared, that venomous creatures will live in Stroma, whereas they die immediately if tran&s;ported to the Orkneys. The country of Caithne&s;s, though chiefly mountainous, flattens towards the &s;ea coa&s;t, where the ground is arable, and produces good harve&s;ts of oats and barley, &s;ufficient for the natives, and yielding a &s;uper|plus for exportation; but the &s;oil being generally a moi&s;t clay, and the climate cold, the harve&s;t is late, and the corn counted inferior in quality to
<PB N="27" REF="290">
that which is rai&s;ed in the neighbouring counties. Indeed, the country is better adapted for pa&s;ture, and as &s;uch, is turned to the be&s;t advantage. Caithne&s;s is well watered with &s;mall rivers, brooks, lakes, and fountains, and affords a few woods of birch, but is in general bare of trees; and even tho&s;e the inhabitants plant, are &s;tunted in their growth. Lead is found at Dennet, copper at Old-Urk, and iron ore at &s;everal places; but the&s;e ad|vantages are not improved. The air of Caithne&s;s is temperate, though in the latitude of fifty-eight, where the longe&s;t day in &s;ummer is computed at eighteen hours; and when the &s;un &s;ets, he makes &s;o &s;mall an arch of a circle below the horizon, that the people enjoy a twilight until he ri&s;es again. The fuel u&s;ed by the inhabitants of Caith|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of peat and turf, which the ground yields in great plenty. The fore&s;t of Moravins and Berridale afford abundance of red deer and roe-bucks: the country is well &s;tored with hares, rabbits, grow&s;e, heathcocks, plover, and all &s;orts of game, comprehending a bird called &s;nowfleet, about the &s;ize of a &s;parrow, exceedingly fat and delicious, that comes hither in large flights about the middle of February, and takes its departure in April. The hills are covered with &s;heep and black cattle; &s;o numerous, that a fat cow has been &s;old at market for four &s;hillings &s;terling. The rocks along the coa&s;t are frequented by ea|gles, hawks, and all manner of &s;ea-fowl, who&s;e eggs and young are taken in va&s;t quantities by the natives. The rivers and lakes abound with trout, &s;almon, and eels; and the &s;ea affords a very ad|vantageous fi&s;hery. Divers obeli&s;ks and antient monuments appear in this di&s;trict, and &s;everal Romi&s;h chapels are &s;till &s;tanding. Caithne&s;s is well peopled with a race of hardy inhabitants, who employ them&s;elves chiefly in fi&s;hing, and
<PB N="28" REF="300">
breeding &s;heep and black cattle: they are even remarkably indu&s;trious; for between Weick and Dumbith, one continued tract of rugged rocks, extending twelve miles, they have forced &s;everal little harbours for their fi&s;hing boats, and cut ar|tificial &s;teps from the beach to the top of the rocks, where they have erected hou&s;es, in which they cure and dry the fi&s;h for market. The &s;hire of Caithne&s;s gives the title of an earl to a branch of the family of Sinclair. It contains a pre&s;bytery of twelve pari&s;hes, a variety of little towns and villages, and a con&s;iderable number of &s;eats be|longing to gentlemen, though the&s;e are far from being elegant or commodious. The two principal towns are Weick, or Weich, and Thur&s;o: Weick is a royal burrough and market town, in which the head courts are kept: it &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hire, at the mouth of Murray Frith, and has a tide-harbour for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els; but this is little frequented. Thur&s;o, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;hire, though but a barony burrough, is more populous, and better built, than Weich, and boa&s;ts of the be&s;t church in the country. The neighbourhood of Holburn-head forms a good and &s;afe harbour for &s;hipping. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town, runs the water of Thur&s;o, a &s;mall river, &s;o incredibly &s;tocked with &s;almon, which live there all the year, that &s;everal hor&s;e|loads are taken at a time, either by nets or ba&s;kets, which the natives call creels, &s;o contrived with barred doors, as to admit the fi&s;h, and then con|fine them: above three hundred good &s;almons have been taken at one draught of the net, by the fi&s;hermen of Thur&s;o.</P>

<HEAD>SUTHERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Sutherland, including Strathnavern, borders on Caithne&s;s to the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t, is bounded
<PB N="29" REF="310">
by the ocean on the north, the country of A&s;&s;ynt on the we&s;t, Ro&s;&s;e on the &s;outh, and by the Ger|man &s;ea on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t. It &s;tretches about four&s;core miles in length, and forty in breadth; is generally hilly, though in many parts arable; well watered with &s;mall rivers and &s;treams replete with fi&s;h, and exhibiting about &s;ixty lakes, the habitation of various fi&s;h, &s;wans, ducks, gee&s;e, and other wild-fowl. The large&s;t of the&s;e is Loch&s;yn, extending fourteen miles in length: &s;ome of them are inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;mall verdant i&s;lands, which in &s;ummer yield a very agreeable pro&s;pect. On the coa&s;t are many com|modious harbours, and all the bays &s;warm with fi&s;h; nay, the &s;ea in this place produces &s;ome va|luable pearls. Sutherland affords iron, &s;tone, free-&s;tone, lime-&s;tone, and &s;late, in abundance. Here are al&s;o quarries of marble, and mines of coal, though the people u&s;e turf and peat for fuel. Lead-ore, impregnated with &s;ilver, and even &s;ome gold, hath been found in this province, together with chry&s;tals and pebbles.</P>
<P>The air is &s;o temperate, and the &s;oil &s;o good, that &s;affron has here been brought to perfection. Many parts of the country are remarkably fruit|ful in corn, and the pa&s;turage is excellent every where. Be&s;ides three great fore&s;ts, there are many &s;maller woods in Sutherland, abounding with deer, and other game. On the hills are fed numerous flocks of &s;heep and black cattle; &s;mall, yet &s;weet and juicy. There is one bird peculiar to this &s;hire, called knag, which re&s;embles a parrot, and digs its ne&s;t with its beak, in the trunks of oaks. The northern part, called Strathnaver, and &s;epa|rated from the re&s;t by a ridge of mountains, is bounded on the north and we&s;t by the Deucalido|nian and Vergivian oceans, on the ea&s;t by Caith|ne&s;s, and on the &s;outh by A&s;&s;ynt. The length of
<PB N="30" REF="320">
it, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, amounts to four and thirty miles; but the breadth from north to &s;outh, does not exceed twelve in &s;ome places. It is very hilly; and the mountains are &s;o high, that the &s;now re|mains on the tops of them till Mid&s;ummer. It is watered by the river Navern, from whence it de|rives its name: as this di&s;trict gives a title to the elde&s;t &s;on of the earl of Sutherland. Here are &s;everal woods, frequented by deer, and other game, which the people take great delight in hunting. Iron-mines have been worked in &s;ome places, but to no great advantage. Strathnavern has many fre&s;h-water lakes or lochs; the chief of which are Loch Navern, and Loch Lyel: there are &s;everal i&s;lands on the northern coa&s;t; and in various parts of the country we &s;ee monuments of victories obtained over the Danes, or other foreign invaders. Sutherland boa&s;ts of &s;ome towns, and a great many villages. The people are numerous, hardy, bold, and enterprizing; courteous to &s;trangers; chearful, open, frugal, and indu&s;trious. They, as well as their neighbours of Caithne&s;s, &s;peak the language, and wear the garb, u&s;ed in the Lowlands of Scotland. They carry on a con|&s;iderable &s;almon fi&s;hery. They drive a traffick with their black cattle, &s;heep, and hor&s;es, at the neighbouring fairs; but export their corn, barley, &s;alt, coal, &s;almon, &s;alted beef, butter, chee&s;e, wool-&s;kins, hides, and tallow. Here are provi|&s;ions of all &s;orts in plenty; and &s;o cheap through all this country, that a gentleman may keep hou&s;e, and live much more &s;umptuou&s;ly, for two hundred pounds a year in the North of Scotland, than he can live for three times the money in the South of England.</P>
<P>The chief town of Sutherland is the royal burrough of Dornoch, formerly the &s;ee of a bi|&s;hop, and now the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, con&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="31" REF="330">
of nine pari&s;hes. In the cathedral, or great church, we &s;ee the burying-place of the earls of Sutherland. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town ap|pears a monument, called Thane's-cro&s;s: there is likewi&s;e in the neighbourhood of Eubo, a &s;tone cro&s;s, antiently erected over the body of a Dani&s;h king, who was here defeated, &s;lain, and interred. Dornoch has four fairs in the year, well frequented by trading people. There are other towns of in|ferior order, &s;uch as God&s;pey and Brora; the la&s;t &s;ituated at the mouth of a river of the &s;ame name, which is likewi&s;e be&s;towed upon a &s;mall adjacent i&s;land, in which the earl of Sutherland has a hunt|ing-&s;eat, where he &s;ometimes re&s;ides for the diver|&s;ion of deer-hunting. In this neighbourhood are coal-pits, and &s;alt-pans, which afford plenty of the&s;e two commodities for exportation. But the earl's principal &s;eat is Dunrobin, about &s;ix miles from Dornoch, a noble ca&s;tle, &s;aid to be built in the twelfth century, by Robert, Earl of Suther|land: it &s;tands by the &s;ea-&s;ide, commanding an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, and is beautified with parks, plantations, and elegant gardens.</P>

<P>The &s;hire of Ro&s;s (including Tayne and Cro|martie) &s;tretches four&s;core miles in length, and &s;eventy-eight in breadth: is bounded on the we&s;t by the we&s;tern &s;ea, and part of the i&s;le of Skie; by Inverne&s;s on the &s;outh; Strathnavern and Su|therland on the north and north-ea&s;t; and by Cromartie and Murray-Frith on the ea&s;t. Tayne includes the greater part of Ro&s;s, with the i&s;les of Skie, Lewis, and Harries. Cromartie lies on the other &s;ide of Murray-Frith, to the northward of Inverne&s;s, extending but twelve miles in length; bounded on the &s;outh and ea&s;t by part of Ro&s;s,
<PB N="32" REF="340">
and the Frith of Murray, and by the Frith of Cromartie on the north. The &s;hire of Ro&s;s takes up the whole breadth of the i&s;land; and being much indented with bays and inlets from both &s;eas, appears of a very irregular form. The&s;e bays afford &s;afe harbour for &s;hipping, e&s;pecially that of Cromartie, which is capacious enough to contain all the fleets of Europe, being land-locked on every &s;ide, and in all re&s;pects one of the be&s;t harbours in the known world. The Frith of Tayne, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hire, runs up five|and-twenty miles from the &s;ea, as far as the Cape Tarbat, dividing Ro&s;s from Sutherland, being about &s;even miles broad at the mouth; but, on account of quick-&s;ands, un&s;afe for navigation. The country of Ro&s;s is incumbered with huge mountains, on which the &s;now lies for the greate&s;t part of the year; the&s;e, however, yield good pa&s;ture: but, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, next the German ocean, the country admits of agriculture, and produces good crops of corn. The vallies are fertilized by &s;everal rivers, among which we reckon the Okel, the Charron, and the Braan, be&s;ides a good number of fre&s;h-water lakes, which indeed are found in every part of this country. The vallies, or &s;traths, are generally covered with wood; and near Alfarag, there are fore&s;ts of fir, fifteen or twenty miles in length, well &s;tocked with deer, and game of all &s;orts. Great numbers of black cattle, hor&s;es, &s;heep, and goats, are fed upon the mountains: the &s;ea, rivers, and lakes, teem with fi&s;h and fowl. The lochs on the we&s;t|ern coa&s;t abound with herrings in the &s;ea&s;on, particularly Loch Eu, about nine miles long, and three in breadth: one part of this is formed by a bay, or inlet of the &s;ea; and the other is a lake of fre&s;h water. The &s;ides of it are covered with wood, where formerly abundance of iron was
<PB N="33" REF="350">
&s;melted. Though the middle part of Ro&s;s, called Ardro&s;s, is mountainous, and &s;carce inhabited, the north-ea&s;t parts on the rivers Okel, Charron, and Frith of Tayne, are fruitful, and abound with villages. Coygach and A&s;sgut, two northerly di&s;tricts, are bare and hilly; yet they abound with deer and black cattle; and we &s;ee &s;everal good hou&s;es towards the coa&s;t, where there are al&s;o pro|montories, and huge rocks of marble. Ardmea|nach, part of the penin&s;ula betwixt the bays of Cromartie and Murray, is a barony, which of old be&s;towed a title on the king of Scotland's &s;econd &s;on. The di&s;trict of Glen-elchig, on the &s;outh-we&s;t, was the paternal e&s;tate of the earl of Seaforth, chief of the clan Mackenzie: but the la&s;t earl of that name, having ri&s;en in rebellion, was in the year 1719 defeated at Glen&s;hiel, in this very quar|ter, together with a &s;mall body of Spaniards, by whom he had been joined. His auxiliaries were taken; and though he him&s;elf, with &s;ome of his friends, e&s;caped to the continent, his e&s;tate and honours were forfeited. At the &s;ame time, the king's troops, who obtained this victory, di&s;mantled the ca&s;tle of Ylen-donnen, &s;ituated on an i&s;land, in a bay that fronts the i&s;le of Skie: it belonged to the crown; but the office of hereditary gover|nor was ve&s;ted in the earl of Seaforth, and here he had erected his magazine. Ro&s;s is chiefly peo|pled by the Mackenzies and Fra&s;ers, two warlike clans, who &s;peak Er&s;e, and live in the Highland fa&s;hion. There are fi&s;heries carried on along the coa&s;t; but their chief traffick is with &s;heep, and black cattle.</P>
<P>The chief towns of Ro&s;s, are Channerie, Ding|well, Tayne, and Fortro&s;e. Channerie, or Cha|nonrie, &s;o denominated from a college of canons regular &s;ettled formerly in this place, was a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, part of the cathedral and the epi&s;copal palace
<PB N="34" REF="360">
&s;till remaining; at pre&s;ent, it is an incon&s;iderable market town, &s;ituated on the penin&s;ula between the bays of Cromartie and Murray, with a ferry over the la&s;t of the&s;e friths. It is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, compo&s;ed of &s;even pari&s;hes; and is re|markable for nothing but a &s;tately hou&s;e belong|ing to the late earl of Seaforth Dingwell, built at the bottom of Cromartie Frith, is a market-town, and a royal burrough, and the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, including thirteen pari&s;hes. Tayne is al&s;o a royal burrough, a market-town, and &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant and fruitful coun|try, tolerably well inhabited, and enjoying a con|&s;iderable trade, by communication with the We&s;tern i&s;lands, and the herring-fi&s;hery. Before the Re|formation, here was a church dedicated to St. Do|this, to which the people went in pilgrimage. Fortro&s;e is another royal burrough, with a ca&s;tle belonging to the late earl of Seaforth; and now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, together with the greate&s;t part of his fortune, by his &s;on, the lord Fortro&s;e.</P>

<P>The &s;hire of Inverne&s;s, including part of Mur|ray land, together with the countries of Badenoch and Lochaber, adjoins to Ro&s;s and Cromartie on the north; to Murray land on the ea&s;t; to Lorn, Braidalbin, and Athol, on the &s;outh; and on the we&s;t, is wa&s;hed by the We&s;tern ocean. It extends three&s;core miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and five-and-fifty, where broade&s;t, from north to &s;outh. It is, on the whole, a barren country, though it yields plenty of iron ore, produces large woods of fir and oak, plenty of pa&s;turage, and &s;ome corn. Here is plenty of deer, hares, partridges, grow&s;e, and all &s;orts of game, whether fowls or quadru|peds. The hills and mountains produce great
<PB N="35" REF="370">
flocks of black cattle: the rivers and lakes, of which there is a great number in this country, af|ford abundance of &s;almon, eels, and trout; and for &s;ea-fi&s;h, there is hardly a di&s;trict in Scotland &s;o well provided as Inverne&s;s&s;hire.</P>
<P>Badenoch, Lochaber, and Mar, include the whole breadth of Scotland from &s;ea to &s;ea. Bade|noch, or the mo&s;t northerly part, extends about thirty-three miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and &s;even-and-twenty from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, where broade&s;t. This di&s;trict is barren, hilly, but abounding with deer, and diver&s;ion for the &s;port&s;|man. Lochaber is bounded on the north by Ba|denoch; by Athol on the ea&s;t; by Lorn and Braid|albin on the &s;outh, and by a mountainous ridge on the we&s;t, towards the &s;ea-&s;hore. It derives its name from the Lake, or Loch-Aber; extends about twenty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and thirty from north to &s;outh. The country is barren, bleak, mountainous, and rugged. In one of the mo&s;t barren parts of this country, near the mouth of the river Aber, in the center between the We&s;t and North Highlands, &s;tands Fort-William, with the town of Maryburgh, built upon a navigable arm of the &s;ea, not far from the foot of a very high mountain, called Benevis. The town, de&s;igned as a &s;utlery for the garri&s;on, was erected into a bur|rough; and the fort it&s;elf was de&s;igned as a check upon the clan Cameron, who had been guilty of depredations, and other irregularities. It is inha|bited mo&s;tly by the Macdonalds, Camerons, and Mackinto&s;hes, who are not the mo&s;t civilized peo|ple in Scotland, though their chiefs are generally per&s;ons of education, honour, and ho&s;pitality. Macdonald of Glengary, de&s;cended in a &s;traight line from Donald of the I&s;les, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;eat or ca&s;tle in this di&s;trict, which was burned to the ground, and de&s;troyed in the year 1715, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="36" REF="380">
of his declaring for the pretender. The elegant hou&s;e and gardens belonging to Cameron of Lochiel underwent the &s;ame fate, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, after the extinction of the rebellion in the year 1746. The cadets of the&s;e families, which have formed a kind of inferior gentry, are lazy, indigent, and uncleanly; proud, ferocious, and vindictive. The common people, though cele|brated for their bravery, fidelity, and attachment to their chiefs, are counted very &s;avage, and much addicted to rapine. They &s;peak the Er&s;e language, and conform to the cu&s;toms we have de&s;cribed as peculiar to the Highlanders. They pay very little attention to any &s;ort of commerce, but that which con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ale of their black cattle, and lead a &s;ort of vagrant life among the hills; hunting, fowling, and fi&s;hing, as the &s;ea&s;ons permit, and as their occa&s;ions require. They delight in arms, which they learn to handle from their infancy, &s;ubmit patiently to di&s;cipline in the character of &s;oldiers, and never fail to &s;ignalize them&s;elves in the field by their &s;obriety, as well as their valour. While they remain in their own country, nothing can be more penurious, mean, fordid, and uncom|fortable, than the way of life to which the&s;e poor people are inured, whether we con&s;ider their dre&s;s, diet, or lodging. In point of provi&s;ion, they are &s;o improvident, or ill &s;upplied, that, before the winter is over, whole families are in danger of &s;tarving. In this emergency, they bleed their mi|&s;erable cattle, already reduced to &s;kin and bone, and eat the blood boiled with oatmeal. This eva|cuation, added to their former weakne&s;s, enfeebles the cows to &s;uch a degree, that when they lie down, they cannot ri&s;e again without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The chief town from which the &s;hire derives its name is Inverne&s;s, a royal burrough, &s;ituated at the bot|tom of the Frith of Murray, by the mouth of the
<PB N="37" REF="390">
river Ne&s;s, which, flowing from Lochne&s;s, here di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the &s;ea. The town &s;tands on the &s;outh-&s;ide of this river, over which the na|tives have thrown a bridge of &s;even arches. Inver|ne&s;s is the &s;eat of a &s;heriff's judicature, as well as of a pre&s;bytery, containing thirteen pari&s;hes; and may be ju&s;tly denominated the key to the North Highlands. Here is a commodious harbour for &s;mall &s;hips open to the Frith; in con&s;equence of which, the place enjoys &s;ome &s;hare of commerce, though not very con&s;iderable. The town, which is con&s;idered as the capital of the Highlands, con|&s;i&s;ts of four &s;treets, three of the&s;e center at the cro&s;s, which is a &s;tone pillar erected on a pede&s;tal, with circular &s;teps. Here the people meet at fair and market, to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s. The hou&s;es are built of rough, irregular &s;tones, the inter&s;tices be|ing filled with rubble, and the walls afterwards harled or plai&s;tered with mortar. The ground|floor is generally de&s;tined for a &s;hop, or warehou&s;e; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a&s;cends to the upper &s;tory, either by a &s;tone &s;tair built from the &s;treet; or, if the hou&s;e be more than one &s;tory high, by a round winding &s;tair-ca&s;e within the walls, which the Scots call a turnpike. This &s;trange way of building ob|tains in all the towns of North-Britain. Inverne&s;s is pretty large and regular, provided with two churches; in one of which, divine &s;ervice is per|formed in the Highland tongue, for the benefit of tho&s;e who do not under&s;tand Engli&s;h. On a ri&s;ing ground, adjoining to the &s;outh-&s;ide of the town, is an old ca&s;tle, of which the duke of Gordon was hereditary keeper. It was formerly a royal palace, though very &s;mall and inconvenient; but is now converted into part of Fort George, a citadel built in the year 1726, to &s;erve as barracks for &s;ix com|panies of &s;oldiers. The people of Inverne&s;s are &s;aid to have learned Engli&s;h from the garri&s;ons,
<PB N="38" REF="400">
which have been here quartered &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ince the time of Oliver Cromwell, to the pre&s;ent reign. They likewi&s;e pique them&s;elves on their politene&s;s, and look upon their town as a model for neatne&s;s and conveniency. Certain it is, &s;ome of Crom|well's &s;oldiers &s;ettled in this country, and improved &s;ome parts of its neighbourhood, by their indu&s;try and &s;kill in agriculture: nor can it be denied, that the pre&s;ent inhabitants of Inverne&s;s &s;peak the Eng|li&s;h language with more propriety than is ob&s;erved in any other part of North-Britain: but the Er&s;e being vernacular to them, it is not in their power to lay a&s;ide their original accent; and they pro|nounce their words with &s;uch a Highland cadence, or tone, as is even more di&s;agreeable to an Engli&s;h ear than the Low-country dialect. If we may be|lieve travellers, they have &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the neatne&s;s of their town, and the convenience of their hou&s;es. The &s;treets are always covered with dirt; the hou&s;es are ill-contrived, cold, and half fini&s;hed; their furniture is mean, and their habita|tions are intolerably na&s;ty. Doubtle&s;s, there are &s;ome exceptions; but &s;uch is the general character of the people. The attire of the common people is wretched, and &s;ome of their cu&s;toms ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd. There is nothing more common than to &s;ee a tall, raw-boned fi&s;herman, in the &s;ea, mounted on the back of a female, who carries him to and from his boat, with her petticoats tucked up to a very indecent height. This &s;pectacle is not more &s;urprizing to a &s;tranger, than that of half a dozen wenches, &s;tanding in as many tubs, and trampling linnen, with their legs and thighs entirely bare. Such is their manner of wa&s;hing linnen; and the maid-&s;ervants here, as in all other parts of Scot|land, frequently &s;tipulate upon their being hired, that they &s;hall be permitted to wa&s;h in this manner, at the water-&s;ide. It is a &s;ort of fe&s;tival; during

<P>To the north-ea&s;t of Inverne&s;s, we &s;ee the ruins of a fort, built by Oliver Cromwell, on the river Ne&s;s, near its i&s;&s;ue into the Murray Frith: but the greate&s;t curio&s;ity in this neighbourhood is the fre&s;h-water Loch-ne&s;s, above twenty miles long, and two broad, &s;urrounded in many parts by dread|ful precipices; from whence de&s;cend many &s;treams and torrents, above three hundred yards in depth, with a &s;mall i&s;land at the hither end, formed by two branches of the river, and planted with a va|riety of trees. The water of this lake, and the river, never freezes, even in the mo&s;t &s;evere winter &s;ea&s;on; a phaenomenon &s;aid to be owing to veins of &s;ulphur at the bottom: this, however, is not perceivable by the ta&s;te, or any other of the &s;en&s;es. There is a communication between the head of Loch-ne&s;s and the &s;mall lake Loch Oick, about four miles in length. Loch-lochy extends about nine miles in length, communicating with Loch|aber and the We&s;tern Sea; &s;o that there is no more than a neck of land, about fourteen miles in breadth, between them; through which, if a ca|nal were cut, a conveyance by water would be opened from one &s;ide of the i&s;land to the other, and the North-Highlands entirely divided from the

re&s;t of Scotland. On the neighbouring heaths, there are &s;ome cairns and circles of &s;tones &s;tanding erect, like tho&s;e we have el&s;ewhere de&s;cribed. At the di&s;tance of two miles from Inverne&s;s &s;tands the hou&s;e of Culloden, belonging to Mr. Forbes, who&s;e father was lord pre&s;ident of the &s;e&s;&s;ion at Edinburgh, a gentleman of uncommon talents and unblemi&s;hed integrity. This edifice is built of &s;tone, &s;trong, large, and commodious, pro|vided with a noble avenue, good gardens, and parks &s;haded with beautiful plantations. But what has rendered it mo&s;t remarkable was the battle of Culloden, fought upon the adjacent moor in the year 1746, when his royal highne&s;s the duke of Cumberland obtained a complete victory over the Highlanders, commanded by prince Charles Stuart, pretender to the throne of Great-Britain. The other hou&s;es of note in this county are, Ruthen, belonging to the duke of Gordon; Ca&s;tle&s;tewart, to the earl of Moray; Ca&s;tledownie, to the late lord Lovat; and Slate, to Sir Alexander Macdo|nald.</P>
<P>Near the &s;outh end of Lochne&s;s, at Killechumen, the late field-mar&s;hal Wade built a regular fortifi|cation, called Fort-Augu&s;tus, in which there is always a garri&s;on of regular troops to overawe the Highlanders, prevent in&s;urrections, and protect the military roads, which, with incredible pains and per&s;everance, he carried over mountains, mo&s;&s;es, and mora&s;&s;es; &s;o that there is now a beautiful high|way into tho&s;e parts of the Highlands, which were formerly deemed inacce&s;&s;ible. One of the&s;e roads begins at Creif, about fourteen miles from Stirling; pa&s;&s;es through Glenalmond to Aberfaldy, where it cro&s;&s;es the river Tay on a bridge of free-&s;tone, con&s;i&s;ting of five &s;pacious arches, and proceeds to Dalnachardoch: the other road, beginning at Dunkeld, is continued by the Blair of Athol to
<PB N="41" REF="430">
the &s;ame Dalnachardoch, where both joining in one highway, advances to Dalwhinny: there it is again divided into two branches, one of which &s;tretches to the north-we&s;t, through Garva moor, and over the Corieroch mountain, as far as Fort-Augu&s;tus: the other directs its cour&s;e due north to the barracks at Ruthven in Badenoch, and thence by Glengary to Inverne&s;s: from hence it proceeds &s;outh-we&s;terly acro&s;s the i&s;land to Fort-Augu&s;tus, and ends at Fort-William in Lochaber. The&s;e excellent roads, which are &s;ixteen feet broad at the narrowe&s;t part, include forty bridges thrown over rivers, rivulets, and torrents. Some of the&s;e con&s;i&s;t of &s;ingle arches, forty or fifty feet in diameter: &s;ome are compo&s;ed of two arches, one of three, and one of five: they are chiefly founded upon rocks; but this la&s;t, over the Tay, is built of A&s;tler &s;tone, three hundred and &s;eventy feet in length; the middle arch is &s;ixty feet in diameter, and bears an elegant Latin in|&s;cription, to the honour of general Wade, under who&s;e au&s;pices the&s;e roads were made and fini&s;hed by the &s;oldiers, who received extraordinary pay, while they were thus employed. There is a new military road of the &s;ame kind, which begins in the neighbourhood of Dumbarton, and penetrates to Inverary, the county-town of Argyle.</P>

<HEAD>NAIRN.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Nairn, comprehending the we&s;t part of Murray, is bounded on the north by Mur|ray Frith; on the we&s;t and &s;outh by Inverne&s;s, and on the ea&s;t by Elgin. The length of it amounts to twenty miles, and the breadth to fourteen. The air is temperate and &s;alubrious, and the winters are remarkably mild. The face of the country is rough and mountainous; yet there are &s;ome fruit|ful &s;traths, or vallies, which produce good crops
<PB N="42" REF="440">
of oats and barley; but, in general, the country is much better adapted for pa&s;turage. Here are al&s;o large woods of fir, and other trees, that afford &s;helter to the game, of which there is great plenty. A &s;trath is a long, narrow valley, with a river run|ning through the bottom. Of the&s;e, the mo&s;t re|markable in this county, are Strath-nairn, on the river of that name, in the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the &s;hire; and on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide, Strath-erin, on both &s;ides of Findhorne river. Nairn is well wa|tered with &s;treams, rivulets, and lakes, abounding with fi&s;h. In the &s;outhern part, there is a &s;mall lake, called Moy, &s;urrounding an i&s;land, on which there is a ca&s;tle belonging to the laird of Mackin|to&s;h: but the greater part of the &s;hire is peopled by the Frazers, a warlike, Highland clan, who&s;e chief, the lord Lovat, lo&s;t his life on a &s;caffold, for having been concerned in the late rebellion. Here is a great number of villages, but no towns of note, except Nairn, &s;ituated at the mouth of the river, which bears the &s;ame name, a royal burrough, which gave a title of lord to an antient family, forfeited in the rebellion of 1715. The harbour, which opened in the Murray-Frith, is now choaked up with &s;and; and the commerce of the town is too incon&s;iderable to de&s;erve notice. The people in general &s;ub&s;i&s;t by feeding &s;heep and black cattle. About four miles from Nairn &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Calder, on the river of that name, belonging to a branch of the family of Campbell. In this neigh|bourhood we find a quarry of free-&s;tone, and many &s;igns of copper. About &s;ix miles to the north|we&s;t of Nairn, a new fort hath been lately built, by order of the government, at a place called Arde&s;eer, a &s;mall i&s;thmus upon the Murray-Frith, which it is intended to command.</P>

<HEAD>ELGIN.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Elgin is bounded on the ea&s;t by the river Spey; on the we&s;t by Nairn, and part of Lochaber; on the &s;outh by Aberdeen&s;hire and Ba|denoch, and on the north by Inverne&s;s&s;hire, from which it is parted by the Frith, and the river Ne&s;s. It &s;tretches four-and-twenty miles in length, and about twenty in breadth, including part of Mur|ray-land, which is portioned out in the three dif|ferent counties of Inverne&s;s, Nairn, and Elgin. Murray-land, in point of climate and &s;oil, is pre|ferred to any other part in the north of Scotland. The air is mild, temperate, and &s;alubrious: the weather, in fairne&s;s and &s;erenity, is a perfect con|tra&s;t to that of the we&s;t-&s;ide of the i&s;land, remark|able for continual rains and frequent &s;torms; and the &s;oil, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;and, mixed with clay, when duly cultivated, produces all manner of green herbs and fruits in perfection. Murray gives the title of earl to a branch of the Stuart family. Elgin&s;hire, to the &s;outhward, is moun|tainous, affording only pa&s;ture for cattle: but the low-country yields plenty of corn, and the harve&s;t is remarkably early; and &s;ome large tracts are co|vered with va&s;t woods of oak and fir, &s;ome of them ten miles in length. In a word, this county abounds with corn, game of all &s;orts; beef, mutton, poul|try; a variety of fi&s;h, excellent ale, and aqua-vitae once di&s;tilled. The people are civilized, open, ho&s;pitable; &s;peak the language, and wear the garb of the Lowlanders; though here is al&s;o a mixture of clans, who &s;peak Er&s;e, and ob&s;erve the cu&s;toms of the Highlanders. The principal rivers that water Elgin&s;hire are the Spey, the Nairn, the Findern, and the Lo&s;&s;ie. The Spey is broad and rapid: it ri&s;es in Badenoch, and after a &s;erpentine
<PB N="44" REF="460">
cour&s;e of &s;eventy-&s;ix miles, pa&s;&s;es by Rothes ca&s;tle, and falls into the German &s;ea at Garmack, afford|ing an excellent &s;almon-fi&s;hery. The river Nairn takes its ri&s;e in the mountains that &s;eparate Strath|ern from Glentarf; divides the valley to which it gives the name of Strathnairn; and, as we have al|ready ob&s;erved, di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Murray Frith. The Findern is a continuation of the He|rin, which ri&s;es in Badenoch. It gives the name of Stratherin to the valley through which it runs; then a&s;&s;uming the name of Findern, pa&s;&s;es by Turnaway, the town of Forre&s;s, and the abbey of Kinlo&s;s, and likewi&s;e di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Frith of Murray. The Lo&s;&s;ie is a &s;hort river, ri|&s;ing a few miles above Elgin, and falling into the &s;ea a few miles below that burrough. It produces &s;uch abundance of fi&s;h, that in the &s;pace of one mile, by the village of Germach, and during the few months of &s;ummer, four&s;core or an hundred la&s;ts of &s;almon are annually taken, and cured for exportation, be&s;ides a great quantity con&s;umed at home, which are killed with &s;pears, or caught in ba&s;kets, above the town.</P>
<P>The capital of this &s;heriffdom is Elgin, a royal burrough, &s;ituated in a fertile plain, on the &s;outh|&s;ide of the river Lo&s;&s;ie, over which there is a &s;tone bridge. From this town, the family of Bruce in England derive the title of earl. It was formerly the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who re&s;ided at the ca&s;tle of Spynie, about a mile from town, a noble &s;eat, beautified with woods and fine gardens, near a lake that harbours all &s;orts of wild-fowl, and &s;wans in particular. The cathedral appears, from the ruins, to have been a magnificent edifice, inferior to none in the kingdom for extent or workman&s;hip. Elgin, being the county-town, is likewi&s;e the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen pari&s;hes. The town is tolerably neat, and the market well &s;up|plied.
<PB N="45" REF="470">
A good number of the Highland gentry re&s;ide here during the winter, and form an agreeable a&s;&s;embly; and the adjacent country, which is rich and plea&s;ant, exhibits a great number of &s;eats be|longing to gentlemen of ample fortunes. At Kin|lo&s;s, in the neighbourhood of Elgin, from which the earl of Elgin derives the title of baron, we &s;ee the ruins of an antient abbey, where the body of king Duff, who had been murdered, was dug up by accident, and di&s;covered many hundred years after it had been interred. At the di&s;tance of nine miles from Elgin, &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Rothes, on a &s;mall river that falls into the Spey, giving the title of earl to the noble family of Le&s;lie.</P>
<P>Forre&s;s, a market-town, and royal burrough, is &s;ituated on the we&s;t-&s;ide of the &s;hire, on the &s;ide of a &s;mall river, that runs into the Findern. It is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, containing ten pari&s;hes, and was formerly the county-town. Here are the ruins of an old ca&s;tle, which heretofore belonged to the kings of Scotland; and in the neighbourhood, we &s;ee a very curious tall &s;tone-pillar, or obeli&s;k, three-and-twenty feet high above-ground, adorned with a great variety of figures, engraved in a kind of bas-relief, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be a monument of a victory obtained by Malcolm Mackenneth, the Scotti&s;h monarch, over Sueno, king of Denmark. This, however, is no more than a conjecture, founded on the tradition of the country: for no &s;uch victory over the Danes was ever obtained at, or near this place. About eight miles from Elgin is the &s;mall town of Aberlour, &s;tanding near the Spey, being the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, compo&s;ed of &s;even pari&s;hes.</P>

<P>Argyle&s;hire, or Argathilia, which, together with Perth&s;hire and the We&s;tern I&s;lands, is &s;aid to have con&s;tituted the antient kingdom of the Scots, while the re&s;t of Caledonia was &s;ubject to the Picts and Romans, comprehends Kintyre, Knap|dale, A&s;kodni&s;h, Cowal, Lorn, and &s;ome of the Hebrides. It is bounded on the &s;outh by the Iri&s;h &s;ea, and the Frith of Clyde; on the ea&s;t by Perth&s;hire; on the north-ea&s;t by Lochaber; and on the north-we&s;t by &s;everal i&s;lands. The extent of it from &s;outh to north, between the Mull of Kintyre and Lochaber, amounts to ninety miles; and the breadth, in &s;ome places, including the i&s;les, to &s;eventy. This country, like all other parts of the Highlands, affords a very wild and horrid pro&s;pect of hills, rocks, and huge moun|tains, piled upon each other in a &s;tupendous and dreadful di&s;order; bare, bleak, and barren to the view, or at be&s;t, covered with &s;hagged heath, which appears black and di&s;mal to the eye, except in the &s;ummer, when it is variegated with an a|greeable bloom of a purple colour. The coa&s;t of Argyle is rocky, yet indented with bays and in|lets, that afford good harbours for &s;hipping. The country is well watered by rivers, brooks, and lakes, abounding with fi&s;h; the vales and flat parts of it are cultivated for corn; the mountains feed an innumerable quantity of black cattle, which run wild among the hills in winter as well as &s;ummer; the heath and woods, of which there is a con&s;iderable number, afford &s;helter to deer, roebucks, and all &s;orts of game in great plenty: the circumambient &s;ea, with its locks, bays, and harbours, pours forth myriads of fi&s;h; but the innate wealth of the country is dug from the
<PB N="47" REF="490">
bowels of the mountains, in iron, copper, lead, and other metals and minerals.</P>
<P>Argyle is the &s;eat of a provincial &s;ynod, con|&s;i&s;ting of five pre&s;byteries and forty-nine pari&s;hes; and gives the titles of duke and earl to the noble family of Campbell, the mo&s;t powerful of all the Scotti&s;h nobility. The duke of Argyle is, by he|reditary right, great ma&s;ter of the king's hou&s;e|hold in Scotland, admiral of the We&s;tern I&s;les, general of Denoon ca&s;tle, and, before the juri&s;|dictions were aboli&s;hed, enjoyed other hereditary offices, which rendered him too powerful as the &s;ubject of a limited monarchy. He &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many royalties; his va&s;&s;als, even of the name of Campbell, are &s;o numerous, and his influence ex|tends &s;o far, that he could, on occa&s;ion, bring three or four thou&s;and fighting men into the field. Agyle&s;hire is in general peopled by this clan, and affords a great number of ca&s;tles and &s;eats be|longing to gentlemen who hold of the duke, and boa&s;t them&s;elves de&s;cended from his family.</P>
<P>Kintyre, or Cantierre, &s;ignifying the Head-Land, and con&s;tituting the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of this &s;hire, is a penin&s;ula, &s;tretching thirty &s;even miles from north to &s;outh, and &s;even miles in breadth. It is mo&s;tly plain, arable, and populous, inhabited indi&s;criminately by Highlanders and Lowlanders; the latter being invited to &s;ettle in this place by the Argyle family, that the lands might the better be cultivated. It gives the title of marquis to the duke, and is by Lochfyn di|vided from Argyle-proper. This loch is an inlet from the &s;ea, about &s;ixty miles in length and four in breadth, affording heretofore an excellent her|ring-fi&s;hery. Here are many paultry villages; but the only town of any con&s;ideration is Camp|bell Town, &s;tanding on the lough of Kilkerran, a royal burrough, with a weekly market, and the
<PB N="48" REF="500">
&s;eat of the pre&s;bytery, con&s;i&s;ting of ten pari&s;hes. It is provided with a &s;afe and commodious har|bour, &s;ecured by an i&s;land at the mouth of the bay, and is, in all re&s;pects, admirably &s;ituated for commerce. Neverthele&s;s, there is very little trade carried on in the place, which is ill built, thin|ly inhabited, and exhibits all the marks of po|verty and indigence.</P>
<P>Knapdale, or the &s;econd divi&s;ion of Argyle&s;hire, is parted from Cowal on the ea&s;t, by Lochfyn, borders with Kintyre on the &s;outh, with Lorne on the north, by Braidalbin on the north-ea&s;t, and on the we&s;t, by the Hebrides. Its length, from north to &s;outh, does not exceed twenty miles, and the breadth in &s;ome places may amount to thirteen. It is joined to Kintyre by a neck of land, not above a mile broad, over which the country people often drew their &s;mall boats, to &s;ave the trouble of &s;ailing round Kintyre. This part of Knapdale abounds with lakes; &s;ome of them containing little i&s;lands, on which there are ca&s;tles belonging to differont proprietors. The ground is more adapted for pa&s;turage than grain; but that on the &s;ide of Lochaw is fruitful in both. The di&s;tance by &s;ea from the Mull, or extreme point of Kintyre, to the Fair Foreland of Colerain, on the north coa&s;t of Ireland, does not exceed &s;ixteen miles. The chief town of Knap|dale is Inverary, on the water, or river Eira, which here falls into Lochfyn. This royal bur|rough is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve pari&s;hes, and gives the title of baron to the duke of Argyle. The town is ill built, &s;mall, poor, and incon&s;iderable; but in the neighbour|hood &s;tands upon the &s;ide of the loch, a &s;trong and &s;pacious ca&s;tle, built in the Gothick manner, by the pre&s;ent duke of Argyle, commanding a delightful pro&s;pect on the lake, provided with ele|gant
<PB N="49" REF="510">
gardens, and &s;urrounded with woods, parks, and plantations, which belonged to the old ca&s;tle, which was formerly the re&s;idence of the family. Here his grace keeps open hou&s;e, while he him|&s;elf is pre&s;ent; and in the town of Inverary, he has built an inn, in the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, for the accommodation of travellers. Kilmore is another little paultry town, at the di&s;tance of five miles from Inverary, built upon a &s;mall river, that like|wi&s;e falls into Lochfyn, and the &s;eat of a pre&s;|bytery, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve pari&s;hes. Both pla|ces are admirably &s;ituated for commerce, which, as the duke is perfectly well acquainted with all its branches, will, it is to be hoped, flouri&s;h un|der his au&s;pices.</P>
<P>The third divi&s;ion of Argyle&s;hire is Lorne, which gives the title of marquis to the duke of Argyle. It extends above thirty miles in length from north to &s;outh; and about nine at its utmo&s;t breadth, bounded on the ea&s;t by Braidalbin; on the we&s;t by the i&s;lands; on the north by Loch|aber; and is divided from Knapdale on the &s;outh, by Loch Ettif, on the banks of which &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Bergomarn, wherein the courts of ju&s;|tice were anciently held. This di&s;trict, abounding with lakes, is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fertile part of Argyle&s;hire, producing plenty of oats and barley. It once belonged to the antient family of Mac Dougal, &s;till re&s;iding on the &s;pot; but devolved to the lords of Argyle, in con&s;equence of a mar|riage with the heire&s;s, at that time a branch of the Stuart family. The only place of note in this di&s;trict is the ca&s;tle of Dun&s;taffnage, or St. Ste|phen's Mountain, which formerly belonged to the kings of Scotland, &s;ome of whom are here interred: at pre&s;ent it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the duke of Argyle, and governed by an hereditary cap|tain.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="520">
The fourth divi&s;ion is Argyle, properly &s;o call|ed, bounded by Knapdale and Cowal on the &s;outh; Lochaber on the north; Lennox and the Gram|pian hills on the ea&s;t; and Lorne on the we&s;t. It lies between Lochfyn and Lochow; which la&s;t is a fre&s;h water lake, about a mile broad, but ex|tending four and twenty in length, including twelve i&s;lands, on two of which there are the ca&s;tles of Enconel and Glenurquhart. This lake, which gives the title of vi&s;count to the duke of Argyle, i&s;&s;ues in the river Aw, which, after a cour&s;e of &s;ix or &s;even miles, enters Loch Ettiff, and this falls into the We&s;t Sea, oppo&s;ite to the i&s;le of Mull: all the&s;e abound with excellent trout and &s;al|mon.</P>
<P>Cowal, a &s;ubdivi&s;ion of Argyle&s;hire, lies be|tween Lochfyn and the Frith of Clyde, having the i&s;le of Bute to the &s;outhward, and on the north Argyle Proper, with the Grampian moun|tains. Here are plenty of lakes and &s;treams, a few woods, many mountains, and abundance of heath. Cowal produces &s;ome corn, a good num|ber of cattle, a great deal of game, and a variety of fi&s;h, both from the &s;ea and rivers. Here is no other town but the wretched village of Dunoon, inhabited by a few fi&s;hermen, formerly the re&s;i|dence of the bi&s;hop of Argyle; but now the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, including eight pari&s;hes. What we have &s;aid of the genius, di&s;po&s;ition, language, habit, and cu&s;toms of the Highlanders in general, may be applied to tho&s;e of Argyle in particular. In point of religion, they are mo&s;tly pre&s;byterians; with re&s;pect to trade and manufacture, they excel their brethren of the mountains. Some fi&s;heries are car|ried on with &s;pirit along the coa&s;t, and a few pri|vate adventurers have e&s;tabli&s;hed a kind of linen manufacture, which affords comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence to a good number of both &s;exes: yet even

here, trade and indu&s;try are &s;till in their infancy, and if not very tenderly nur&s;ed, will never attain to any degree of maturity.</P>

<HEAD>PERTHSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Perth, including Menteith, Brai|dalbin, Athol, Stratherne, part of Gowree, and Perth Proper, is one of the large&s;t, riche&s;t, and faire&s;t counties in North-Britain; bounded by Ba|denoch and Lochaber on the north and north|we&s;t; by Marr on the north-ea&s;t; by Argyle and Lennox on the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t; having Clackmannan&s;hire, part of Stirling&s;hire, and the Forth to the &s;outh; the &s;hires of Kinro&s;s and Fife to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and Angus to the ea&s;t. It ex|tends above &s;eventy miles in length, and near &s;ixty at its greate&s;t breadth, exhibiting a variety of High|lands and Lowlands; mountains, hills, dales, and &s;traths, diver&s;ified with pa&s;ture-grounds, corn|fields and meadows, rivers, lakes, fore&s;ts, woods, plantations, inclo&s;ures, towns, villages, and a great number of elegant &s;eats, beautifully &s;ituated, be|longing to noblemen and gentlemen. The chief rivers of Perth&s;hire are the Tay, the Keith, and the Ierne, be&s;ides a great number of &s;ubordinate &s;treams.

for its &s;almon fi&s;hery, and its &s;teep cataract, near the Blair of Drummond, the noi&s;e of which is &s;o loud as to deafen tho&s;e who approach it. The river Ierne ri&s;es from Loch-ierne, a lake &s;even miles long, in the mountainous country of Strath|erne: this river, after a cour&s;e of four and thirty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, during which it receives many &s;treams and rivulets, falls into the Tay, at Abernethy.</P>
<P>Free-&s;tone, lead, iron and copper ores, with &s;ome lapis calaminaris, are found in different places of Perth&s;hire. The &s;oil, being generally rich and well manured, produces excellent wheat, and all kinds of grain. The hilly country abounds with pa&s;ture for the black cattle, hor&s;es, &s;heep, goats, and deer. The heaths, woods, and fore&s;ts, are &s;tored with variety of game; the rivers teem with &s;almon and trout; the gardens and orchards are &s;tored with all kinds of herbs, roots, apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, and almo&s;t every &s;pecies of fruit found in South Britain. The hou&s;es and attire, even of the commonalty, are neat and decent; and every pea|&s;ant can produce a good quantity of linen, and great &s;tore of blankets, made in his own family. Indeed, this is the ca&s;e through all the Lowlands of Scotland. Flax is reared by every hu&s;band|man, and, being dre&s;&s;ed at home, is &s;pun by the females of his family into thread for linen; this is woven by country weavers, of whom there is a great number through all the Low Country, and afterwards bleached or whitened by the good wife and her &s;ervants; &s;o that the whole is made fit for u&s;e at a very &s;mall expence. They likewi&s;e wa&s;h, card, &s;pin, and weave their wool into tartan for plaids, ker&s;ies, and coar&s;e ru&s;&s;et cloth, for com|mon wearing, be&s;ides great part of it, which is knit into caps, &s;tockings, and mitts. Plaids, made of the fine&s;t wor&s;ted, are worn either plain
<PB N="53" REF="550">
or variegated, as veils, by women of the lower, and even of the middling rank: nay, &s;ome years ago, ladies of fa&s;hion wore &s;ilken plaids with an undre&s;s: this is a loo&s;e piece of drapery, gathered about the head, &s;houlders, and wai&s;t, on which it is cro&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to leave the hands at liberty, and produces a very good effect to the eye of the &s;pectator. In the country towns of Perth, and other counties in Scotland, one may, in a &s;um|mer's evening, &s;ee the females, old and young, &s;itting at their doors, working at their &s;pinning|wheels, knitting &s;tockings, and making lace on cu&s;hions with bobbins; a little piddling manu|facture imported of old from France, where it &s;till prevails. The Lowlanders of Perth&s;hire are civilized, ho&s;pitable, and indu&s;trious: the com|merce of the country con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in corn, lin|nen, and black cattle: there are, moreover, &s;ome merchants who trade to foreign countries. We &s;hall now de&s;cribe Perth&s;hire in its different divi|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Menteith, bounded on the north by Braidalbin and Stratherne; on the &s;outh by Stirling&s;hire and Lennox; on the ea&s;t by Fife; and on the we&s;t by another part of Lennox, extends forty-four miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and twenty-eight in breadth. It derives its name from the river Teith, or Taich, &s;tretches as far as the mountains on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Lochlomond, and gave the title of earl to a branch of the family of Graham. The country is hilly, and neither very populous nor fertile; nor is there any place of note in the whole divi&s;ion, except Dumblaine, &s;tanding on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river Allan, a &s;mall, neat town, agreeably &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant valley, &s;urrounded with hills, which form a natural amphitheatre. It was here|tofore a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, erected by king David I. The ruins of the epi&s;copal palace, of a hou&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="560">
built for canons regular, and of a magnificent ca|thedral, are &s;till to be &s;een. The duke of Leeds, in England, derives the title of vi&s;count from Dumblaine; but the place is much more famous for the battle fought in this neighbourhood, in the year 1715, between the duke of Argyle, who commanded the king's army, and the Highland clans under the earl of Mar, who had &s;et up the pretender's &s;tandard. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from Dumblaine, there is a fine &s;eat, which belonged to lord Drummond, vi&s;count of Strathallan.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Braidalbin, &s;tretching two and-thirty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and thirteen, where broade&s;t, from north to &s;outh, is a mountainous country, lying among the Grampian hills, &s;up|po&s;ed to be the country antiently known by the name of Albanii; whence the Highlanders, to this day, call them&s;elves Albinich. It is roughened with mountains and moors; bounded on the we&s;t, by Lochaber, Lorn, and Knapdale; on the north and ea&s;t, by part of Lochaber, and part of Athol; and on the &s;outh, by Stratherne and Menteith. It produces plenty of game, and black cattle; is inhabited by Highlanders, &s;aid to be the mo&s;t fe|rocious in all Scotland; and gives the title of earl to a branch of the Campbell family, which is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a noble and magnificent &s;eat in this divi|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Athol, the mo&s;t northern di&s;trict, borders on the north, with Badenoch; on the we&s;t, with Lochaber; on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t, with Mar and Gowrie; on the &s;outh, with Stratherne and Perth Proper; and on the &s;outh-we&s;t, with Braid|albin. The length of it amounts to forty-three miles, and the breadth to thirty. The country exhibits a very rough appearance of mountains, hills, and fore&s;t, part of the antient Caledonian fore&s;t: yet the&s;e are inter&s;per&s;ed with fruitful
<PB N="55" REF="570">
vallies. Here are &s;everal villages, but no towns of any con&s;ideration; the people are compo&s;ed of Highlanders and Lowlanders, though the latter bear the greate&s;t proportion. The mo&s;t noted place of Athol is Blair ca&s;tle, &s;eated on the river Tilt, near its influx into the Gurry, a plea&s;ant limpid &s;tream that falls into the Tay. This ca&s;tle belongs to the duke of Athol, who derives his title from this di&s;trict, and lives here with great magnificence, the hou&s;e being a &s;tately edifice, &s;urrounded with fine gardens, parks, and planta|tions, affording &s;helter to deer, and all &s;orts of game. In the &s;ame neighbourhood, we &s;ee the pa&s;s of Gillicranky, rendered memorable by the battle here fought in the beginning of king Wil|liam's reign, between that monarch's general Mackay, and the Highlanders adhering to king James. The&s;e la&s;t obtained the victory, though their beloved commander, the vi&s;count of Dun|dee, lo&s;t his life in the engagement.</P>
<P>The &s;tewartry of Stratherne, bounded on the &s;outh by Menteith, and part of Fife; by part of Menteith on the we&s;t; by Perth Proper on the ea&s;t; and on the north, by Athol and Braidalbin, extends about forty miles in length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and half as much in breadth, deriving its name from the river Erne, which, as we have already ob&s;erved, takes its ri&s;e from a lake of the &s;ame name, and, after a winding cour&s;e of thirty-five miles, falls into the Tay. Stratherne, pro|perly &s;o called, is a fertile valley, four miles broad on both &s;ides of this river, finely diver&s;ified with &s;eats and plantations. The chief of the&s;e are Tullibardin and Dupplin ca&s;tle. The fir&s;t be|longs to the duke of Athol, who thence derives the title of marquis: the other is the family &s;eat of the earl of Kinnoul, to whom it gives the title of vi&s;count. This is an elegant hou&s;e, adorned
<PB N="56" REF="580">
with a variety of fine paintings, and having the advantage of a noble park, well planted with fo|re&s;t-trees. In the neighbourhood, a &s;ignal vic|tory was obtained over the Scots, by a body of Engli&s;h auxiliaries, under the command of Ed|ward Baliol, competitor with David Bruce, for the Scotti&s;h throne. Stratherne is an agreeable country, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Ierne mentioned by the Roman writers. It abounds with corn and cattle; woods, peat, and turf for fuel: the Ochil hills, that run along the &s;outhern parts, are rich in minerals, particularly copper and lapis calami|naris; and there is plenty of lead in Glenlyon. At the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner of this di&s;trict, by the conflux of the Erne and Tay, &s;tands the town of Abernethy, heretofore the capital of the Picti&s;h kingdom; but at pre&s;ent a paultry village, exhi|biting no &s;igns of its antient magnificence, con|&s;iderable for nothing but in being the &s;eat of a &s;mall pre&s;bytery, con&s;i&s;ting of five pari&s;hes. The only relique of antiquity to be &s;een in the place is a hollow pillar, or cylinder, &s;eventy-five feet high, and about forty-eight feet in external circum|ference at the ba&s;e, built of hewn &s;tone, open at top, and without any in&s;cription. Abernethy gives the titles of marquis and earl to the duke of Dou|glas, and &s;ome individuals of the family are here interred. In the neighbourhood of this town, on the public road, there was a famous &s;tone monu|ment, called Macduff's cro&s;s, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a barbarous, unintelligible in&s;cription, and &s;aid to have been a &s;anctuary for any per&s;on guilty of man&s;laugh|ter, provided he could prove him&s;elf within the ninth degree of con&s;anguinity to the de&s;cendants of Macduff, thane of Fife, by whom the tyrant Macbeth was dethroned. Of this pillar, how|ever, nothing is now left but the pede&s;tal. At Ardoch and Innerpeffery, we &s;ee the remains of
<PB N="57" REF="590">
two Roman ca&s;tella: the fort of Ardoch is the mo&s;t intire, and be&s;t pre&s;erved piece of Roman anti|quity it &s;tands on the water of Kneck, in Strath|allan: the &s;outh &s;ide is fortified with five rows of ditches, and &s;ix ramparts: three of the four gates are &s;till di&s;tinct and plain, as is the praetorium, the &s;pot on which the general's tent was pitched. On the other &s;ide of a little bridge is a &s;mall barrow, tumulus, or burying-place, in which &s;e|veral Roman urns and medals were found. On the other &s;ide of the river, called the Keir, we perceive a great many circumvallations and ram|parts of &s;tone, or earth, and regular terraces de|&s;cending on the declivity of what is called Grin|ning-Hill. To the northward of fort Ardoch, are the ve&s;tiges of a large ditch upon the moor, con|tinued above two miles; and on the neighbour|ing hills are two great cairns, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Cairnwochel and Cairnlee, the for|mer being the large&s;t of the kind in all Britain. Beyond the&s;e, there is another &s;mall ca&s;tellum, call|ed Cemp's ca&s;tle. The great Roman military way from Stirling and Dumblaine pa&s;&s;es by this hill, in its progre&s;s to Innerpeffery; in the neighbour|hood of which, at the &s;mall village of Strathgeth, there is another Roman ca&s;tellum, with &s;ome part of the ditch and ramparts &s;till vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Car&s;e of Gowrie lying on the north &s;ide of the Tay, extending fourteen miles in length from Dundee to Perth, and from two to four in breadth, is a rich, plain country, cultivated like a garden, and producing as good harve&s;ts of wheat, as are to be &s;een in any part of Great-Britain. It is in|ter&s;per&s;ed with the &s;eats of gentlemen, and abounds with almo&s;t all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. But, from its low, damp &s;ituation, the people are &s;ubject to agues, and the commonalty in great want of firing. In this di&s;trict, not far from the
<PB N="58" REF="600">
Tay, &s;tands the hou&s;e of Errol, which formerly belonged to the earls of that name, the chiefs of the antient family of Hay, hereditary con&s;tables of Scotland.</P>
<P>Perth Proper, &s;tretching twenty miles in length, and, at &s;ome places, fifteen in breadth, is bounded on the north-ea&s;t, by the Car&s;e of Gow|rie; on the ea&s;t, by Angus; on the we&s;t, by Stratherne; on the north, by Athol; and on the &s;outh, by the Frith of Tay. This is likewi&s;e a fruitful country, populous, and well cultivated, abounding with gentlemen who po&s;&s;e&s;s opulent e&s;tates; with farmers who under&s;tand agriculture; and with manufacturers who turn their indu&s;try to great account. North-ea&s;tward from Perth to Brechin, lies the vale of Strathmore, one of the mo&s;t fertile di&s;tricts in Scotland, which gives the title of earl to the noble family of Lyon. Glamis, the &s;eat of this nobleman, &s;tanding on the north|&s;ide of the Tay, is a noble palace, by far the large&s;t in Scotland, adorned with lofty turrets and &s;pires, which, being &s;een through the long vi&s;tas of the park, exhibit an ever-varying pro&s;pect, like that of a great city. The apartments are large, magnificent, and &s;o numerous, that in the year 1715, four&s;core and eight beds were made in it, for the pretender and his retinue.</P>
<P>Perth, the capital of the province, is an agree|able, populous town, &s;ituated twenty miles within land, on the &s;outh bank of the river Tay. It was otherwi&s;e called St. John&s;ton's, from a church de|dicated to St. John, as the patron of the place. It is a royal burrough, &s;econd in dignity to the metropolis, the feat of a large pre&s;bytery, and gave the title of earl to the family of Drummond, which is now forfeited. Perth, in the reign of Edward I. of England, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the En|gli&s;h, who &s;ecured it with fortifications: but, af|ter

an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, they were expelled by Robert Bruce. In the year 1715, the rebels made it a place of arms, and retired to it, after the battle of Dumblaine; but they were in a little time di&s;lodged by the duke of Argyle, and re|treated northwards with the pretender. The town is populous and hand&s;ome, the &s;treets are well paved, and tolerably clean at all times, and the hou&s;es, though not &s;tately, make a very decent appearance. Here is a large church, an old pa|lace that belonged to the earls of Gowrie, but now devolved to the crown; a &s;tately town-hou&s;e, &s;everal other public edifices, and hou&s;es belonging to gentlemen. A mona&s;tery of Carthu&s;ians was here e&s;tabli&s;hed by king James I. of Scotland, who lo&s;t his life on the very &s;pot, by the treachery of Athol, and his accomplices. The town was antiently provided with a &s;tone bridge over the river, which an inundation &s;wept away. Perth was formerly one of the riche&s;t places in Scot|land. At pre&s;ent, it is chiefly maintained by the linnen manufacture, and by a tolerable &s;hare of trade to the Baltic and Norway: for, though it &s;tands at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, the tide flows above the town, and brings up ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burthen. Dunkeld, &s;tanding on the north &s;ide of the Tay, at the foot of the Gram|pian hills, and &s;urrounded with plea&s;ant woods, is the chief market-town of the Highlands, and the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery. The place is beautified with &s;everal neat buildings, erected by the duke of Athol. It is a noted pa&s;s towards the High|lands, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been formerly the chief town of Caledonia. Its cathedral was dedi|cated to St. Columba, and the chapter of preben|daries con&s;i&s;ted of black monks, known by the name of Culdees. In the year 1716, Dunkeld was made a place of arms by the Highlanders, who declared for the pretender.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="620">
Scone, or Scaan, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the center of the kingdom, is a royal palace, &s;tanding on the north bank of the Tay, famous, in former ages, for the adjoining abbey, founded for the monks of the order of St. Augu&s;tine. Here the kings of Scotland were crowned in the fatal chair, &s;aid to be brought by Fergus from Ireland, including in its bottom a rough marble &s;tone, formerly in|&s;cribed with this di&s;tich:</P>
<Q><L>Ne fallat fatum Scoti, quocunque locatum,</L>
<L>Invenient lapidem, regnare tinentur ibidem.</L></Q>
<P>The chair was removed from hence by Edward I. of England, and depo&s;ited in We&s;tmin&s;ter|abbey, where it &s;till remains. Scone gives the title of baron to the vi&s;count Stormont, a branch of the family of Murray. He is al&s;o hereditary keeper of this palace, which is large, &s;pacious, and magnificent, though built in the antient man|ner: &s;ome of the pannels are adorned with paint|ings, performed above two hundred years ago; and here is a bed of fine needle-work, &s;ewed by the hands of Mary, queen of Scots. The hou&s;e was provided with elegant gardens, a chapel, and offices: but the whole is now fallen into decay. It was in the chapel that king Charles II. took the covenant, when the Scots invited him to this king|dom. Here the pretender re&s;ided three weeks, in all the &s;tate of a monarch; while his general, the earl of Mar, lay with his forces at Perth.</P>
<P>Culro&s;s is a royal burrough, &s;tanding on the &s;ide of the river Forth, and formerly included in Fife&s;hire. The inhabitants of this place carry on a con&s;iderable traffick with coals, &s;alt, and a manufacture of girdles, which are round, thin, iron plates, on which the Scots bake their bread, made of oatmeal. In the neighbourhood of the

<P>The &s;hire of Bamff, comprehending part of Buchan, with the countries of Strathdovern, Boyn, Enzie, Strathaven, and Balvenie, extends thirty-two miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and thirteen in breadth from north to &s;outh. On the &s;outh, it is &s;eparated from part of Buchan by the river Ugie; on the ea&s;t, it is watered by the Dovern and the German ocean; on the we&s;t, it is bounded by the Spey, and the country of Murray; on the &s;outh|we&s;t, it borders on Badenoch, and the Braes of Mar; and on the north, it is confined by the Murray Frith. The face of the country is agree|ably diver&s;ified with hill and dale, not without woods, well watered with rivers, and exhibiting many &s;eats and plantations. The air is pure and keen, the climate healthy, and the &s;oil fertile, producing plentiful crops of corn. The country of Buchan, extending northwards from the river Ugie to the &s;ea, and we&s;tward as far as Dovern, comprehending a tract of twenty miles in length, and nine in breadth, is more free from hills and mountains than any other country of the &s;ame ex|tent in the kingdom of Scotland. It is inhabited chiefly by Lowlanders, and gives the title of earl to the chief of the family of Er&s;kine. The coun|try of Bamff abounds with the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life. The pa&s;ture-grounds yield &s;heep, cattle, and hor&s;es: the arable lands pro|duce plenty of corn; while the rivers and &s;ea &s;up|ply great quantities of fi&s;h. Various minerals have been found in different parts of the &s;hire;

and a piece of amber, as large as a hor&s;e, was once ca&s;t a&s;hore on the beach. In the moun|tainous di&s;trict of Balvenie, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the &s;hire, watered by the Spey, there is a no|ted rock, which produces hones and whet-&s;tones, &s;ufficient to &s;upply the whole i&s;land. Here are al&s;o veins of allom-&s;tone, and &s;prings of allom|water. Strathalan, another di&s;trict to the north|ea&s;t of Balvenie, abounds with &s;uch plenty of lime-&s;tone, that the inhabitants u&s;e it as common &s;tone in building their hou&s;es; and moreover burn a great quantity of it into lime, which they &s;ell to good advantage in the village of Keith, on the river Dovern. Along this whole coa&s;t, there are antient Dani&s;h monuments, &s;uch as cairns, tumuli, and huge &s;tones &s;tanding erect. In Strathaven, a hilly country, lying along the lim|pid river Avin, which falls into the Spey, we meet with Gordon ca&s;tle, belonging to the duke of Gordon, the mo&s;t princely edifice in the north of Scotland, con&s;i&s;ting of noble apartments, magnificently furni&s;hed, and environed with fine gardens and parks, well &s;tored with fallow deer.

Inverugy, and Keith. Bamff, &s;ituated on the coa&s;t of the Murray Frith, is a royal burrough, of very little con&s;ideration. It was of old &s;ecured by a ca&s;tle, which is now in ruins: this is like|wi&s;e the ca&s;e with the abbey of Deer, in the neigh|bourhood, which belonged to the Ci&s;tercian monks, and was founded by William Cumin, earl of Bu|chan. The inhabitants are mo&s;tly hu&s;bandmen; and here is no other commerce, than that which ari&s;es from corn, and the &s;almon-fi&s;hery. The greater part of the adjacent country is occupied by the Ogilvies, a numerous and valiant tribe, headed by the earls of Airly and Findlater, who have elegant &s;eats in this country. Cullen, an antient royal burrough, &s;ituated al&s;o on the Mur|ray Frith, is capital of the little di&s;trict of Boyne, a tract fruitful towards the coa&s;t; but in other parts mountainous, and abounding with quarries of &s;potted marble. Deer-town, on the river Ugie, is remarkable for nothing but being the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery. Turreff, &s;eated on a &s;tream that falls into the Dovern, is a market-town, and &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, &s;tanding in an agreeable &s;porting country, inter&s;per&s;ed with the hou&s;es of gentlemen. Fra&s;erburg, reckoned the chief town of Buchan, is a &s;ea-port on the Murray Frith, having a large commodious harbour, &s;ecured by a pier and bulwark of free-&s;tone, lately built at the expence of Fra&s;er, lord Saltoun, who lives in the neighbourhood. Inverugy is a &s;mall incon&s;i|derable town, &s;tanding near the mouth of the ri|ver Ugie, commanded by a ca&s;tle: on the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide of the river, there is another, called Craig's Tower, which formerly belonged to the earl-mar&s;hal, who was lord of almo&s;t all the neigh|bouring manors; but forfeited his e&s;tate and ho|nours by engaging in the rebellion of the year 1715.</P>

It extends near fifty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about thirty-&s;ix from north to &s;outh. The air is keen and &s;alubrious, the climate being temperate both in winter and &s;ummer. The face of the country is diver&s;ified with hill and dale, well watered with rivers, and well furni&s;hed with woods.

The capital of this county is Aberdeen, &s;itu|ated in the country of Mar, about four&s;core miles north of Edinburgh. It &s;tands upon the rivers Dee and Don, and is in effect divided into two di&s;|tinct towns. Old Aberdeen, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, built at the mouth of the Don, was formerly the &s;eat of a bi&s;hop, having a &s;tately cathedral dedicated to St. Machar, the greater part of which was built by bi&s;hop Elphing&s;tone in the year 1500; and here is a noble monument erected to his memory. The church is built of hewn &s;tone, with a lofty &s;teeple or turret, ending in an imperial crown, with a round globe of &s;tone and two gilded cro&s;&s;es. Hard by the church is a library, furni&s;hed with a valuable collection of books: but old Aberdeen is chiefly remarkable for the college founded by king James IV. con&s;i&s;ting of a principal, &s;ub-principal, regents, or profe&s;&s;ors, of divinity, civil law, phy&s;ic, phi|lo&s;ophy, and the languages. To the&s;e endowments Charles I. added eight bur&s;ers out of the revenues, of vacant bi&s;hopricks; king Charles II. be&s;towed upon it the benefices of vacant churches in &s;everal dioce&s;es for &s;even years: from the&s;e benefactions it derived the name of the Caroline Univer&s;ity. It was erected into an univer&s;ity by a bull of pope Alexander VI. to king James IV. and bi&s;hop El|phing&s;tone, with as ample privileges as tho&s;e grant|ed to Paris and Bononia. The town is &s;mall, in|differently built, and incon&s;iderable, though very antient. About a mile from hence, at the mouth of the river Dee, is New Aberdeen, the county town, a neat, populous, and flouri&s;hing city, adorned with churches, ho&s;pitals, a fine wharf, a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and many &s;tately edifices built of hewn &s;tone. The &s;treets are large and well paved, the private hou&s;es lofty, and well fini&s;hed, provided with gardens and orchards, which appear intermingled with the buildings, and at a di&s;tance give it the air of a city
<PB N="66" REF="680">
built in a wood. The chief of the public edifices is the college, originally a Franci&s;can mona&s;tery, founded by George Keith, earl-marechal, in the year 1593, and from him called the <HI>academia mare&s;|challana:</HI> it is compo&s;ed of a principal, four pro|fe&s;&s;ors of philo&s;ophy, one for divinity, and one for mathematics; and, together with the old college, forms the univer&s;ity of Aberdeen. Be&s;ides this college, there is a grammar &s;chool, founded by Dr. Dune, con&s;i&s;ting of a ma&s;ter and three u&s;hers. Aberdeen is likewi&s;e provided with a &s;chool for mu&s;ic, and a library, erected at the charge of the city, well &s;upplied with books, and furni&s;hed with mathematical in&s;truments. Among the public buildings, we reckon a bridge over the Dee, about a mile from the city, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even arches, and built of free &s;tone, at the expence of bi&s;hop Gavin Dunbar: a bridge over the Don, con&s;i&s;ting of one very lofty Gothic arch: the cathedral dedi|cated to St. Nicholas; an alms-hou&s;e, and three ho&s;pitals. Aberdeen &s;tands on the beach of the German ocean, covering three hills of an ea&s;y a&s;cent, and containing about eighteen thou&s;and inhabitants. It be&s;tows the title of earl upon an antient branch of the family of Gordon, and is, for beauty, wealth, commerce, and extent, the third city of Scotland. The people are civil, polite, and well educated, generally of the epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion; &s;o that here are &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es and chapels provided with organs, in which the Engli&s;h liturgy is read.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to commerce, they are very well &s;ituated, having a good anchoring-place for &s;hips in the bay: but the entrance into their tide-haven is very difficult, the channel being narrow, and the bar often &s;hifting. The quantity of &s;almon taken in the Dee and the Don is altogether a&s;toni&s;hing: the be&s;t kinds of &s;ea-fi&s;h are caught in great abun|dance;
<PB N="67" REF="690">
in particular, herrings, which they pickle for exportation. They rai&s;e hogs, and &s;alt them for the &s;ame purpo&s;e: they carry on &s;everal manufactures of linen and woollen, including that of wor&s;ted &s;tockings, &s;ome of which are knit upon needles of incredible finene&s;s, in&s;omuch that one pair has been &s;old for thirty &s;hillings. They export their herrings, or woollen commodities, or both, to Dant|zick, Koning&s;berg, Riga, Nerva, Stockholm, Ham|burgh, Norway, all parts of the Baltic, as well as to France and Holland. They &s;end their &s;almon, linen, and pork, to London; and a great quan|tity of this la&s;t, barrelled up, they &s;ell to the Dutch, as provi&s;ion for their &s;hips bound to the Ea&s;t In|dies. In a word, Aberdeen is one of the mo&s;t thriving and agreeable places in Great Britain. The conver&s;ation of the inhabitants is &s;en&s;ible and plea&s;ing: they enjoy mo&s;t of the polite diver&s;ions that are &s;o much coveted in other cities: their mar|kets are regularly and plentifully &s;upplied with ex|cellent fi&s;h, fowl, and butcher's meat; and every article of expence is &s;o rea&s;onable, that a man may live better in all re&s;pects at Aberdeen for three hundred pounds a year, than in London for double that income.</P>
<P>The other towns of Aberdeen&s;hire are Kintore, In|verurie, Peterhead, Garioch, Kildrummy, Strath|bogie, Alford, and Ellin. Kintore is a royal borough, &s;ituate upon the Don, which gives the title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Keith: in other re&s;pects, it is incon&s;iderable. Inverurie, &s;tanding at the conflux of the rivers Ourie and Don, is a royal borough, in the neighbourhood of which king Robert de Brus obtained a &s;ignal victory over Cum|min, the parti&s;an of Edward I. king of England: it is likewi&s;e remarkable for a &s;kirmi&s;h between the laird of Macleod's men and a party of the rebels under lord Lewis Gordon, in the year 1745, when
<PB N="68" REF="700">
the former were di&s;comfited. Peterhead, upon the promontory of Bucchanne&s;s, is a market-town and &s;ea-port of con&s;iderable commerce, where the Pretender landed in the year 1715. It lies within a &s;mall i&s;land called Calk-inch, and has two little piers to receive &s;mall ve&s;&s;els at high water: but, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town, there is a bay or road capable of containing an hundred &s;ail of &s;hips in eight or nine fathoms of water, well &s;ecured from the north-we&s;t, we&s;t, and ea&s;terly winds. Garioch, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and chief town of the di|&s;trict &s;o called, is a &s;mall incon&s;iderable place, &s;itu|ated in a valley, watered by &s;treams, and &s;ur|rounded with verdant hills, one of which, known by the name of Mount Bennachy, ri&s;es in &s;even tops &s;o high that it is di&s;cerned a good way at &s;ea, though it &s;tands at the di&s;tance of fourteen miles from the coa&s;t. Kildrummy is an old mar|ket-town on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Don, where for|merly the earls of Mar re&s;ided, and where the la&s;t nobleman of that name &s;et up the Pretender's &s;tandard in the year 1715. Strathbogie, or Strath|bolgy, giving name to the di&s;trict &s;o called, &s;tands upon the river Dovern, over which there is a bridge near its conflux with the Bogie, is a market town, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by the linen manufacture. The di&s;trict or divi|&s;ion of Strathbogie, which king James VI. created into a lord&s;hip in favour of the Gordon family, is chiefly inhabited by the va&s;&s;als of the duke, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a noble &s;eat or ca&s;tle in this quarter. It is fruitful in corn and pa&s;ture, &s;o as to furni&s;h &s;heep, hor&s;es, and black cattle for exportation; and remarkable for fine linen yarn, &s;pun by the good wives, and &s;old to the merchant manufacturer. The &s;oil of Strathbogie is &s;o rich, and the climate &s;o mild, that the harve&s;t here is more early than in the ea&s;t parts of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex. Alford, on

the &s;outh &s;ide of the Don, and Ellen, on the river Ythan, where a pre&s;bytery likewi&s;e convenes, are paultry towns of little or no importance: but the adjacent country is rich, fertile, and agreeable. In Aberdeen&s;hire, we meet with many monuments of antiquity, &s;uch as round Dani&s;h forts, &s;ingle obe|li&s;ks, tumuli, and cairns.</P>

<HEAD>KINCARDINSHIRE, or MEARNS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, &s;tretching twenty-&s;even miles in length, and twenty in breadth, is bounded on the ea&s;t by the German ocean; on the &s;outh by the river of North E&s;k; on the we&s;t, by Angus; and on the north by the river Dee, and Aberdeen&s;hire. The country is pretty plain and level, fruitful in corn and pa&s;turage, producing an infinite number of fir trees, be&s;ides a great number of agreeable plantations; and along the &s;ea-coa&s;ts there are ma|ny convenient creeks and harbours.</P>
<P>Stonehive, the &s;eat of the county courts, is a &s;mall town with a good haven, improved by the late earl|marechal, and enjoys a good &s;almon fi&s;hery. Kin|cardin, another con&s;iderable place, &s;tands on the river Dee, and gives the title of earl to a branch of the family of Bruce. Cowy is an antient borough, greatly decayed, and remarkable for nothing but the ruins of a ca&s;tle, &s;aid to have been built by king Malcolm Kenmore. Fourdon, or Mearns, is a &s;mall town, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and before the reformation, famous for the reliques of St. Palladius, who was &s;ent over to Scotland in the fifth century by pope Cele&s;tine, to enlighten the Scots, and confute the Pelagians. Fourdon is likewi&s;e noted as the birth-place of Fordun, author of the Scoti Chronicon, the olde&s;t hi&s;tory of Scot|land now extant. In the neighbourhood of this town, is Paldy Kirk, deriving its name from St.

Palladius; but remarkable for nothing el&s;e except an annual fair, at which great quantities of coar&s;e cloth are bought up and exported to the Nether|lands.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t memorable place in Kincardin&s;hire, is the ca&s;tle of Dunotyr, formerly the family-&s;eat of the earls-marechal of Stotland. It &s;tands almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible on a &s;teep rock, wa&s;hed on three &s;ides by the &s;ea, and joined to the land by a narrow i&s;thmus. It is fortified with &s;trong walls and towers, and the old buildings were &s;even &s;tories high: the new buildings are large and elegant, provided with a good library. Within the clo&s;e there is a large ci&s;tern thirty cubits in circumference; and in the neighbourhood there is a dropping cave, the water of which petrifies and hangs from the roof like icicles. The people of this country are Lowlanders, civil, ho&s;pitable, and indu&s;trious.</P>

<HEAD>FORFARSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Forfar, including Angus, Glenila, Glene&s;k, and Glenpra&s;&s;in, extends twenty-nine miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and &s;ixteen where broade&s;t, though in &s;ome places the breadth does not exceed five miles. On the north it is divided from the Brae of Mar, by a ridge of the Binchinnen mountains; it is bounded on the &s;outh by the frith of Tay, and the Briti&s;h ocean; on the ea&s;t by Mearns; and on the we&s;t by Perth&s;hire. Part of the Grampian Mountains runs through this country, which is a|greeably diver&s;ified with hill and dale. It produces lead and iron in abundance, together with quarries of free&s;tone and &s;late, with which the inhabitants drive a con&s;iderable traffic. The county is well watered with lakes, rivers, rivulets, and fountains, &s;haded with large fore&s;ts, roughened with brown mountains, and waved with green hills inter&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="71" REF="730">
with fields and meadows, and adorned with fine &s;eats and plantations. Their heaths and woods abound with hart, hind, roebuck, and moor game; their &s;treams are &s;tocked with trout and &s;almon. Their hills are covered with flocks of &s;heep, and their fields afford plentiful harve&s;ts of wheat and all &s;orts of grain. The mountains to the we&s;t and north are inhabited by Highlanders; but the Low|landers po&s;&s;e&s;s the towns and champaign country, and are remarkable for their politene&s;s and ho&s;pi|tality, though this la&s;t virtue often degenerates into downright debauchery; in&s;omuch that the gentle|men value them&s;elves upon their prowe&s;s in drink|ing. The common people are &s;ober, numerous, and addicted to traffic. Forfar&s;hire exhibits many monuments of antiquity. At the village of Miggle, in the neighbourhood of Coupar, there are &s;everal &s;tones erected in the church-yard, embelli&s;hed with the figures of different animals and other ornaments. In the church-yard of Glamis, we &s;ee an old obeli&s;k or intire &s;tone &s;ixteen feet high, &s;et up over the grave of king Malcolm II. who was murdered by the connivance of his own dome&s;tics. This &s;tone is engraved with a number of figures alluding to the regicide; and at a little di&s;tance, within the park of Glamis, there is another &s;tone marked with hieroglyphical &s;ymbols, which &s;eem to ex|pre&s;s the perpetration of the &s;ame murder. At the village of Co&s;&s;ens, in the &s;ame neighbourhood, a very curious obeli&s;k appears lying in the fields. It is known by the name of St. Orland's &s;tone, and exhibits a great variety of figures in bas relief. There is another &s;mall &s;tone in&s;cribed with figures at Balutheren, in the neighbourhood of Dundee. At the di&s;tance of a mile to the &s;outhward of Glamis, &s;tands Denoon ca&s;tle, upon an eminence, environed with &s;teep rocks almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, hav|ing on the north two or three rows of terraces. It is
<PB N="72" REF="740">
built in a &s;emicircular form, encompa&s;&s;ed with a &s;tupendous wall of &s;tone and earth, &s;even and twenty feet high, and thirty feet in thickne&s;s. It has two entries, one to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and another to the north. The whole circumference of the wall a|mounts to three hundred and thirty-five yards; and within this area, the ruins of antient buildings are &s;till vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The county-town Forfar be&s;tows its name upon the &s;hire, and gave the title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Douglas, which title was ex|tingui&s;hed at the death of the la&s;t earl, a gallant youth, who lo&s;t his life in the battle of Dumblaine. The town, though incon&s;iderable, is a royal bo|rough, and &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery. The Scotti&s;h par|liament frequently &s;at in this place, which was al&s;o honoured with a royal palace, of which &s;carce any ruins now remain. The mo&s;t flouri&s;hing town of this county is Dundee, antiently called Alutum and Taodunum, the birth-place of the hi&s;torian Hector Boethius. It is &s;ituated at the foot of a hill, on the north &s;ide of the Tay, not far from this river's influx into the ocean. Dundee is a royal borough, and &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, hand&s;omely built, and inferior to few towns in Scotland, in &s;trength, &s;ituation, and commerce. Dundee an|tiently gave the title of earl and dignity of con|&s;table to the family of Scrimgeour, the head of which was hereditary &s;tandard-bearer to the kings of Scotland, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a noble &s;eat at Diddup, in the neighbourhood. The title of vi&s;count Dun|dee was afterwards be&s;towed upon Graham of Clavers, a valiant partizan of James II. in oppo|&s;ition to king William. He headed a body of the clans, who obtained a victory over William's troops at Gillicranky; but the vi&s;count lo&s;t his life in the engagement. The con&s;tabulary of Dundee was afterwards be&s;towed upon the duke of Douglas,
<PB N="73" REF="750">
who, as marquis and earl of Angus, enjoys great &s;uperiorities in this county. During the civil wars Dundee made a good defence again&s;t the earl of Montro&s;e; but it was afterwards taken by general Monk, who ma&s;&s;acred all the garri&s;on, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of an immen&s;e booty. The gen|tlemen of the neighbourhood had &s;ent thither their be&s;t effects for &s;ecurity; and &s;ixty &s;ail of &s;hips were found in the harbour. In the year 1715, the place was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the rebels, and here the chevalier de St. George for &s;ome days re&s;ided. The town is two miles in compa&s;s; and the hou&s;es, generally built of &s;tone, are neat and convenient. Here is an open &s;pacious market-place, from whence the town &s;preads in four large &s;treets, well paved and regular. The great church is a high &s;quare build|ing, larger than that of St. Giles at Edinburgh, with a noble town-hou&s;e, more &s;pacious than that of the Brill in Holland. Dundee is likewi&s;e adorned with &s;everal other fine edifices, private as well as public. The harbour, lying two or three leagues within the mouth of the Tay, is large enough to contain an hundred &s;ail of &s;hips; but the&s;e not of any con&s;iderable bur|then. The harbour is connected with the town by an agreeable paved walk, &s;haded with rows of trees. This &s;erves as an exchange for the merchants and &s;hip-ma&s;ters; and on one &s;ide there are large &s;tore|hou&s;es for goods, and granaries for corn. The town is large and populous. The inhabitants are gay and wealthy. They carry on a con&s;iderable inland traffic in corn and linen, and enjoy a tolera|ble &s;hare of foreign trade. They export to Lon|don and Am&s;terdam large quantities of corn brought from the car&s;e of Goury, and the vale of Strathmore.</P>
<P>The &s;econd town of Forfar, in point of importance, is Montro&s;e or Monro&s;s, antiently called Celuria and Mons Ro&s;arum, &s;tanding at the corner of a
<PB N="74" REF="760">
&s;mall bay fronting the German ocean, betwixt the rivers North E&s;k and South E&s;k. The town, con&s;i&s;ting of one long hand&s;ome &s;treet, lying pa|rallel with the &s;hore, is neatly built and well &s;itu|ated for commerce, having a good harbour for &s;hips of con&s;iderable burthen. The inhabitants are opulent from the effects of indu&s;try: they are particularly addicted to commerce, which they have extended to &s;uch a degree, that Montro&s;e, for fo|reign trade, is now one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing towns in Scotland. This place gives the title of duke, marquis, and earl, to the noble family of Graham, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for its valour and integrity; and here it was that the Pretender took &s;hipping for France in the year 1716, when he found him&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed by the duke of Argyle, at the head of his maje&s;ty's forces.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame coa&s;t, by the river Brothock, &s;tands the town of Aberbrothock or Arbroth, a royal borough and &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, &s;ituated near the promontory called Redhead, and having a con|venient harbour for commerce. Here was once a very rich and &s;tately mona&s;tery founded by Wil|liam I. of Scotland, in honour of his friend and intimate acquaintance the celebrated Thomas Becket, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. The founder lies buried in the church, under a magnificent mo|nument, which he him&s;elf cau&s;ed to be erected for that purpo&s;e. On account of this mona&s;tery king John of England, at his reque&s;t, granted to the inhabitants of Aberbrothock, the &s;ame privileges through all England except London, that were enjoyed by his own &s;ubjects. The patent for this extraordinary indulgence is &s;till pre&s;erved among the records of the town.</P>
<P>Brechin is a &s;mall town, &s;ituated on the river South E&s;k, over which the inhabitants have built a &s;tately bridge of two arches. It is a royal
<PB N="75" REF="770">
borough, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and affords a good market for &s;almon and cattle. Brechin is memorable for a great battle fought in its neigh|bourhood in the beginning of the eleventh century, between the Scots and Danes. The&s;e la&s;t were de|feated chiefly by the prowe&s;s of Keith, who, with his own hand, &s;hew the Dani&s;h general. He was immediately after the battle ennobled, and created hereditary earl-marechal of Scotland, a dignity enjoyed by his po&s;terity, until it was forfeited in the year 1716, by the earl's engaging in the cau&s;e of the Pretender. Brechin was once a bi&s;hop's &s;ee: the ruins of the epi&s;copal palace, and the hou&s;es in which the canons lived, are &s;till vi&s;ible. The place was antiently &s;ecured by a ca&s;tle on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town, which was gallantly defended by Sir Thomas Maule, again&s;t Edward the fir&s;t of Eng|land: but now there is an elegant hou&s;e on the &s;pot, belonging to the Earl of Panmure, head of the &s;ame family. About four miles to the &s;outhward of Brechin, at a place called Aberlemny, we find four or five antient obeli&s;ks, one of which is engraved with figures, &s;uppo&s;ed to be monuments of a great victory gained at the village of Loncarty, by the Scots over the Danes; a victory entirely owing to the va|lour of an hu&s;bandman and his two &s;ons, of the &s;ur|name of Hay, who were ennobled for their prowe&s;s by king Kenneth III. From the&s;e de&s;cended the earls of Errol, hereditary high-con&s;tables of Scotland.</P>

<HEAD>CLACKMANNAN.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;mall &s;hire of Clackmannan, not exceeding eight miles in length, and five in breadth, is limited on the north by the Ochil Hills; on the &s;outh by the Frith of Forth; on the ea&s;t by Perth&s;hire; and on the we&s;t by Sterling&s;hire. The country is plain and fertile towards the Frith, producing corn and pa&s;ture in abundance. It likewi&s;e yields a great
<PB N="76" REF="780">
quantity of excellent coal, which is exported to England, France, and Holland. It is watered by the rivers Frith and Devan, and joins the &s;hire of Kinro&s;s in &s;ending a member alternately to parli|ament. Clackmannan, the county town, is a &s;mall borough, &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing-ground, about eight and twenty miles from Edinburgh. The ca&s;tle is a &s;tately edifice, belonging to Bruce of Clackmannan, who was hereditary &s;heriff of the county before the juri&s;dictions were aboli&s;hed. But the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing place of this &s;hire is the vil|lage of Aloa or Aloway, &s;ituated on the Forth, where this river falls into the Frith, a &s;ea-port of con&s;iderable trade, which owns a good number of &s;hips, and pro&s;ecutes divers profitable manufactures. The inhabitants weave excellent &s;ail-cloth; make ropes; and have erected &s;aw-mills for cutting and &s;plitting timber, which, together with hemp, tar, and other naval &s;tores, they import from Norway, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Livonia. Here the merchants of Gla&s;|gow had &s;ettled a factory, and erected warehou&s;es for tobacco, &s;ugar, and other American commodi|ties, for the conveniency of re-exporting them to Holland, Hamburgh, and the Baltic; as well as for &s;towing &s;uch merchandize as they imported from the&s;e countries. This &s;cheme however was found to be a pretext, under which the mo&s;t &s;can|dalous frauds were committed, relating to the drawback on tobacco, and other &s;muggling prac|tices. The Forth at Aloa is as broad as the Thames at London bridge; and ri&s;es &s;o high with every tide of flood, that &s;hips can lie with their &s;ides to the wharf, which is at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town, and be loaded and unloaded with|out the lea&s;t difficulty. Along the &s;hore there are &s;alt-pans for boiling &s;alt, which is exported in great quantities by &s;hips from Bremen, Hamburgh, Nor|way, and other parts of the Ea&s;t Country. The
<PB N="77" REF="790">
town of Aloa con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;pacious &s;treet, well paved, and &s;haded with rows of lime trees. The place is large and populous; the hou&s;es are neat, and the inhabitants wealthy. Hard by the town &s;tands Alloway ca&s;tle, which belonged to the earl of Mar, &s;urrounded with beautiful gardens, woods, and plantations, one of the mo&s;t magnificent &s;eats in Great Britain; whether we con&s;ider the edifice it&s;elf, the nature of its &s;ituation, or the beautiful parterres adorned with &s;tatues and va&s;es, the ave|nues, ponds, and pieces of water, the walks, ter|races, lawns, and vi&s;tas by which it is encompa&s;&s;ed. One of the&s;e views terminates in the ca&s;tle of Stir|ling, which, though no more than four miles di&s;tant by land, is about four and twenty by water, tracing the Forth in its beautiful meanders. This &s;uperb ca&s;tle was forfeited to the government, in con&s;e|quence of the la&s;t earl's embarking in the rebellion of the year 1715.</P>

<HEAD>FIFESHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Fife, antiently called Ro&s;s, in|cluding the &s;hire of Kinro&s;s, is a penin&s;ula, lying between the Frith of Forth and the Tay, above forty miles in length and &s;eventeen in breadth, bounded on the north by the Frith of Tay; on the &s;outh by the Frith of Forth, which divides it from the Lothians; on the we&s;t by the Ochil Hills, and part of Perth&s;hire; and on the ea&s;t by the German ocean. The face of this country is diver&s;ified with hill and dale: towards the we&s;t it is mountainous; the middle is mo&s;t proper for pa&s;ture: but, the northern and &s;outhern parts are plain and fertile, producing excellent corn, full of towns, and indent|ed with good bays and harbours. The face of the country is enriched with plantations and woods, affording harbour to deer and all &s;orts of game:
<PB N="78" REF="800">
the hills are covered with &s;heep, who&s;e wool is in great e&s;timation; and the pa&s;tures feed plenty of black cattle. Fife produces quarries of excellent free&s;tone, coal mines, and lead ore in great plenty, together with variegated chry&s;tals. It is well wa|tered by many lakes, rivers, and &s;treams, the chief of which are the Leven and the Eden, abound|ing with &s;almon; and the &s;ea that wa&s;hes the coa&s;t affords great abundance of fi&s;h. Fife is the mo&s;t populous province in Scotland, and exhibits a greater number of fine &s;eats belonging to gentlemen and noblemen, than are found in any other &s;hire of the kingdom. The gentry are generous, ho&s;pi|table, and polite, though too much addicted to drinking: the common people are brave and in|du&s;trious; but from the nature of their &s;ituation, their indu&s;try is apt to take a wrong turn, and ex|ert it&s;elf in a &s;muggling commerce. The whole coa&s;t is almo&s;t covered with fi&s;hing towns, which breed a great number of hardy &s;eamen; and, be|ing royal boroughs, &s;end a great many mem|bers to parliament. Among the towns of Fife, we reckon Coupar, Dumfermlin, Falkland, Balmeri|noch, Inverkythen, Aberdour, Brunti&s;land, King|horn, Kircaldy, Dy&s;art, Kinro&s;s, Ely, St. Monans, Pittenweem, We&s;t and Ea&s;t An&s;truther, Crail, and St. Andrews.</P>
<P>Coupar of Fife, the county-town, &s;ituated on the river Eden, is a royal borough, tolerably hand|&s;ome, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and well inhabited, though almo&s;t quite de&s;titute of trade and manu|facture. Dumfermlin, &s;ituated at the we&s;tern end of the &s;hire, is a &s;mall, neat, royal borough, much decayed in trade, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting chiefly by a manu|facture of linen and diaper: it is agreeably &s;eated on the river Eden, over which there is a bridge at this town, is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and famous for being a place of re&s;idence and burial to many

Scotti&s;h kings. Here are the ruins of a royal ca&s;tle, and a mona&s;tery; the fir&s;t built upon an ad|jacent hill by king Malcolm Kenmore, the other founded by David I. for Benedictine monks, and fini&s;hed by one of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Part of it &s;till &s;erves for a church, and is &s;aid to be as large and long as the cathedral at Carli&s;le. At the end of this mona&s;tery is a &s;mall caemitery, where we &s;ee the tomb-&s;tones of king Malcolm and his &s;on Ed|ward, who were treacherou&s;ly &s;lain at the &s;iege of Alnwick, as well as that of his queen St. Mar|garet, &s;i&s;ter to Edgar Atheling, the true Saxon heir of the Engli&s;h throne. The&s;e tombs are no other than &s;imple grave-&s;tones of coar&s;e marble, plain, unpoli&s;hed, and unin&s;cribed. King James VI. re&s;ided at Dumfermlin, where his children prince Henry, Charles, and Elizabeth, were born. It once gave the title of earl to a branch of the family of Seaton, which is now extinct; and the marquis of Tweedale retains the title of hereditary hou&s;ekeeper or chamberlain of the royal palace at Dumfermlin, though it is now in ruins. Falkland, &s;ituated near the center of the &s;hire, is a neat little town, with an hand&s;ome well paved market-place. It &s;tands on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the Lomond Hill, a moun|tain of a va&s;t height, producing fine pa&s;turage, and yielding a very noble and exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the adjacent country. Falkland is a borough cor|porate, of which the king is always provo&s;t, and the bailiffs are cho&s;en from the town council. Hard by the town appear the ruins of a palace built by king James V. which, in magnificence and beauty of architecture, exceeded any other edifice in Great Britain. It was built in the form of a &s;quare, two &s;tories high, &s;urrounded with rows of marble pil|lars of the Corinthian order, with a &s;tatue on the top of every column, and adorned with &s;culpture in bas relief, repre&s;enting the emperors and em|pre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="80" REF="820">
between every window. At the entrance &s;tood two &s;tately towers and a chapel on the right hand, likewi&s;e adorned with &s;tatues as large as the life. This palace was furni&s;hed with exten&s;ive gardens, and a noble park eight miles in circum|ference, planted with oak, and well &s;tocked with deer. Two parts of the quadrangle were wantonly burned down by the ruffian &s;oldiers of Cromwell, and the trees felled for timber, to build a citadel and barracks at Perth: the park was al&s;o ploughed up, and is now let upon lea&s;e, together with the gardens, by the duke of Athol, hereditary keeper of the palace, who draws a con&s;iderable income from the&s;e lands and the neighbouring &s;tewartry. King James VI. re&s;ided at Falkland when he re|ceived the tidings of queen Elizabeth's decea&s;e from the mouth of her kin&s;man Mr. Carey, whom James forthwith created lord vi&s;count Falkland, a title &s;till enjoyed by his po&s;terity. Balmerinoch, an incon&s;iderable place on the Frith of Tay, is re|markable for nothing but the ruins of a famous mona&s;tery founded by Ermengrid, wife to William, king of Scotland. It likewi&s;e gave the title of baron to a branch of the family of Elphing&s;tone, which was forfeited in the year 1746, by Arthur, lord Balmerinoch, who then &s;uffered decapitation on Tower-hill, for having trea&s;onably joined the &s;on of the Pretender. Innerkythen, a royal bo|rough at the bottom of the Frith, has the advan|tage of a good road for &s;hipping, and formerly enjoyed a tolerable &s;hare of trade; but is now fallen to decay. Aberdour is a market-town on the Frith, of very little trade or con&s;equence. It gives a title to Douglas, earl of Moreton, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es an agreeable &s;eat in this neighbourhood, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to Edinburgh. Brunti&s;land or Burnt|i&s;land, &s;tanding on the &s;ame Frith, over again&s;t Leith, is a paultry market-town with an excellent
<PB N="81" REF="830">
harbour, capacious, land-locked, and &s;ecure from every wind that blows. From the ruins of a ca&s;tle, a &s;tately church, and the remains of &s;ome other edifices, this &s;eems to have been formerly a place of con&s;equence: at pre&s;ent the inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t by &s;trangers that cro&s;s the Frith from hence in the pa&s;&s;age-boats, or lie wind-bound in the har|bour; and by a &s;mall manufacture of green linen. Kinghorn, on the &s;ame coa&s;t, is a royal borough, tolerably well built, but exhibiting evident &s;ymp|toms of decay; and indeed this is the ca&s;e with all the &s;ea-port towns of Fife. Here is a thread manufacture of &s;tockings, knit by the women; as for the men, they are chiefly mariners employed in coa&s;ting &s;hips, in the fi&s;hery, or the pa&s;&s;age-boats from hence to Leith, from which the town of King|horn derives con&s;iderable advantage. The place gives a &s;econd title to the earl of Strathmore. Kirk|aldy, &s;tanding on the &s;ame beach, two miles farther to the north-ea&s;t, is likewi&s;e a royal borough, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and gives the title of baron to the earl of Melvil. The town is populous, well built, extends a mile in length from we&s;t to ea&s;t, con&s;i&s;ts of two pari&s;hes, and enjoys a tolerable &s;hare of trade, by exporting its own produce and manu|factures of corn, coal, linen, and &s;alt. On the &s;ame &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of two miles from Kirkaldy, we arrive at Dy&s;art, another royal borough, for|merly large and populous, and well built, with a commodious harbour and &s;ituation well adapted for commerce: but the trade is now decayed, the number of inhabitants dimini&s;hed, the hou&s;es are ruinous, and every thing bears the appearance of poverty. The people &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the &s;alt-pans and coal-pits in the neighbourhood, and a few makers of hardware and nail-makers &s;ettled in the town. The late lord Sinclair re&s;ided at Dy&s;art, which gives the title of earl to the Engli&s;h family of Ptole|mache,

by means of a marriage with the heire&s;s of Dy&s;art, the patent granted by Charles I. extending to heirs male and female. Kinro&s;s, giving name to a &s;hire or county included in Fife, is a &s;mall in|land town, &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide of Lochlevin, a fre&s;h water lake about ten miles in compa&s;s, a|bounding with pike, trout, perch, and water fowl; containing two i&s;lands, on one of which appear the ruins of a priory heretofore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Culdees: the other is famous for the ca&s;tle in which Mary, queen of Scots, was impri&s;oned by her rebellious nobles. She e&s;caped from hence by means of the governor's &s;on, joined the Hamiltons and &s;ome other noblemen, who pre&s;erved their loyalty, gave battle to her ba&s;tard brother Murray, at Lang&s;ide, where her forces being routed, &s;he unhappily fled to England. Ely, a &s;mall town upon the coa&s;t, inhabited by fi&s;hermen and mariners, &s;tands on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Leven, and has the advantage of a good harbour, &s;ecured by a fine mole of free|&s;tone, built in the la&s;t century at the expence of William Scot, baron of Ardro&s;s, with &s;o much art and &s;olidity that it might vie with the works of the antient Romans. Here is a little traffic with &s;alt and coal. St. Monans, Pittenweem, the An|&s;truthers, and Crail, are very poor decayed bo|roughs, &s;tanding on the &s;ame coa&s;t; but unworthy of any further notice.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t celebrated place in Fife is the city of St. Andrews, otherwi&s;e called Andreanopolis, Fanum Sancti Andreae, and Mons Sancti Reguli. Hither the bones of St. Andrew are &s;aid to have been brought from Patras, a town of Peloponne&s;us, in the fourth century, by Regulus, a Grecian monk, renowned for his piety and learning. St. Andrews was al&s;o the principal &s;eat of the Culdees, who directed all &s;acred in&s;titutions from the fir&s;t con|ver&s;ion of the Picts to Chri&s;tianity Here it was
<PB N="83" REF="850">
that king Alexander I. founded a priory for the monks of the order of St. Augu&s;tine; and hither Kenneth III. tran&s;lated the epi&s;copal &s;ee from Aber|nethy in the ninth century; &s;o that St. Andrews became the metropolis of the kingdom, the &s;eat of its olde&s;t univer&s;ity, and the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, primate of all Scotland. The city is agreably &s;i|tuated on the &s;ea-&s;ide, near a bay that derives its name from the place, &s;urrounded by fields of wheat, barley, and downs intermingled, in &s;uch a favour|able climate that Cardan, the famous phy&s;ician and philo&s;opher, who came hither from Italy to pre|&s;cribe for archbi&s;hop Hamilton, declared it was the mo&s;t healthful place in which he had ever re&s;ided. The harbour is formed by a long pier extending into the &s;ea, which is now greatly decayed; &s;o that the anchoring-place is little better than an open road, where &s;hips of any burthen cannot ride in &s;afety. This is the le&s;s to be regretted, as the trade and navigation of the place is quite extingui&s;hed. St. Andrews was formerly a beautiful city, about two miles in circumference, &s;urrounded with ex|cellent walls, part of which &s;till remain, con&s;i&s;ting of elegant hou&s;es built with hewn &s;tone, adorned with magnificent churches, colleges, mona&s;teries, and other public edifices, and inhabited by the mo&s;t gay, learned, and polite people in Scotland. At pre&s;ent, all its magnificence and &s;plendor are faded; the be&s;t hou&s;es are for&s;aken and ruinous; and the number of the inhabitants greatly dimini&s;hed. They now compute about one thou&s;and inhabited hou&s;es, and four times that number of &s;ouls in the city of St. Andrews, the very ruins of which &s;trike the beholder with awe and veneration. The antient cathedral was counted the large&s;t in Chri&s;tendom, and one of the mo&s;t magnificent Gothic &s;tructures in the world. Hard by the ruins of this cathe|dral, appear the walls of the chapel dedicated to

St. Regulus or Rule, counted one of the mo&s;t an|tient monuments of Chri&s;tianity in Great Britain, together with its &s;quare tower above one hundred feet high, built of &s;uch durable &s;tone, that for many centuries it hath with&s;tood the injuries of time, and &s;till appears intire. Here are two other churches or chapels dedicated to St. Leonard, and St. Salvator; be&s;ides Trinity church, a &s;tately old fabric, of free&s;tone, in good repair, remarkable for the magnificent monument of archbi&s;hop Sharp, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by fanaticks in the la&s;t cen|tury. Over and above the&s;e, St. Andrews contained three religious hou&s;es or priories of Franci&s;can, Do|minican, and Augu&s;tine friars. In a word, this city was famous for &s;anctity, and before the reformation crowded with religious, who came hither to vi&s;it the relics of St. Andrew. It was not only the &s;eat of religion in this country, but the fountain of learning, and &s;till boa&s;ts of the olde&s;t univer&s;ity in Scotland. This was founded by bi&s;hop Henry Wardlaw, in the year 1412, when he endowed it with ample privileges. It con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of three colleges, namely tho&s;e of St. Salvator, St. Leonard, and St. Mary. The fir&s;t was built by bi&s;hop James Kennedy, grand&s;on to king Robert III. about the middle of the fifteenth century. This munificent prelate at the &s;ame time &s;upplied his college with a church and lofty &s;pire of hewn &s;tone; and here is &s;till to be &s;een his monument of curious workman&s;hip. He &s;pared no expence in this foundation, which he endowed with revenues &s;ufficient to maintain four profe&s;&s;ors of philo&s;ophy, a doctor, a batchelor, and licentiate of divinity, to|gether with eight poor &s;cholars. This college owns three &s;ilver maces as old as the foundation, one of them weighing &s;eventeen pounds, is gilt, and curiou&s;ly cha&s;ed. The&s;e three, together with &s;ix other maces, were, in the reign of Charles II.
<PB N="85" REF="870">
found concealed within the tomb of bi&s;hop Kennedy, where in all probability they had been hid at the reformation, in order to pre&s;erve them from the Gothic rage of the reformers, who de&s;troyed or defaced every thing upon which any kind of ima|gery was repre&s;ented. This fabric was repaired and augmented by Dr. Skene, principal of the col|lege, who likewi&s;e founded a library, which &s;oon increa&s;ed by donations; and the earl of Ca&s;&s;ils e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a fund for the maintenance of a profe&s;&s;or of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>St. Leonard's college was founded before the reformation, by James Hepburn, prior of St. An|drews, and afterwards endowed by the earl of Lennox. It con&s;i&s;ts of a principal and four pro|fe&s;&s;ors of philo&s;ophy, and eight poor &s;cholars main|tained on the foundation; and Sir John Scot, of Scots Tarvet, not only e&s;tabli&s;hed a good &s;alary for a profe&s;&s;or of philo&s;ophy, but likewi&s;e made con&s;iderable additions to the library. This was afterwards augmented by a great collection of books bequeathed to it by Sir John Wedderburn, doctor of phy&s;ic; and at pre&s;ent it contains the manu&s;cript of Fordun's Scoti Chronicon. There is commonly a greater number of &s;tudents in this than in the other colleges of St. Andrews; and every year they &s;hoot with bows for the prize of a &s;ilver arrow.</P>
<P>St. Mary's, or New College, was founded by the famous cardinal archbi&s;hop James Beaton, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in the ca&s;tle by Norman Le&s;ly. It con|&s;i&s;ts of two profe&s;&s;ors, doctors in divinity, and a profe&s;&s;or of mathematics. Here the &s;tudents of the other colleges, having pa&s;&s;ed through a cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy, may be admitted to fini&s;h their edu|cation. Mr. Gregory, the mathematical profe&s;&s;or, erected an ob&s;ervatory in the college garden, and furni&s;hed it with proper in&s;truments, by means
<PB N="86" REF="880">
of a public contribution. In one of the apartments of this college, which is the mo&s;t elegant of the three, king Charles I. held a parliament. The rector of the univer&s;ity is cho&s;en annually, and, ac|cording to the &s;tatutes, mu&s;t be one of the three principals. The &s;tudents of all the colleges are di&s;tingui&s;hed by wearing red gowns, and were for|merly very numerous. But the univer&s;ity, as well as the town, has fallen to decay. Before the re|volution the archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews was always chancellor of the univer&s;ity: but when pre&s;bytery was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the faculty obtained a cong&eacute; d'elire from king William, to choo&s;e the duke of Athol: at his decea&s;e they elected the duke of Chandos, who pre&s;ented them with one thou&s;and pounds to be laid out at intere&s;t for the maintenance of a profe&s;&s;or of medicine. St. Andrews was hereto|fore &s;ecured by a &s;trong ca&s;tle, the ruins of which are &s;till vi&s;ible among the rocks on the &s;ea-&s;ide to the northward of the city. Here are al&s;o the re|mains of a &s;trong citadel built by Oliver Cromwell.</P>

<HEAD>ISLE of MAY.</HEAD>
<P>The i&s;land of May, about a mile and a half in circumference, lies &s;even miles from the coa&s;t of Fife, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the rock of Ba&s;s. It for|merly belonged to the priory of Pittenweem, and was dedicated to St. Adrian, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been martyred in this place by the Danes; and hither, in times of popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, barren women u&s;ed to come and wor&s;hip at his &s;hrine, in hopes of being cured of their &s;terility. Here is a tower and light hou&s;e built by Mr. Cunningham of Barns, to whom king Charles I. granted the i&s;land in fee, with power to exact two pence per ton from every &s;hip that pa&s;&s;es, for the maintenance of the light-hou&s;e. In the middle of it there is a fre&s;h water &s;pring, and a &s;mall lake. The &s;oil produces pa&s;turage for an
<PB N="87" REF="890">
hundred &s;heep and twenty black cattle. On the we&s;t &s;ide, the &s;teep rocks render it inacce&s;&s;ible; but to the ea&s;t there are four landing-places and good riding. It was here that the French &s;quadron, having the chevalier de St. George on board, an|chored in the year 1708, when the vigilance of Sir George Byng obliged him to relinqui&s;h his de|&s;ign, and bear away for Dunkirk. The &s;hores all round the i&s;land abound with fi&s;h, and the cliffs with water fowl, &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed among the rocks of the Hebrides. Before we fini&s;h the article of Fife, it will not be improper to take no|tice of &s;ome fine &s;eats belonging to per&s;ons of fa|&s;hion and fortune who re&s;ide in this province. The earl of Rothes, who was hereditary &s;heriff, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a fine palace at Le&s;ley, in the neighbourhood of Coupar, &s;ituated on the river Leven. This mag|nificent &s;eat, more re&s;embling a royal palace than the hou&s;e of a nobleman, was built according to the plan of Sir William Bruce, the Jones of Scot|land, in the reign of the &s;econd Charles. Here it was that James II. while duke of York, re&s;ided, when his brother obliged him to retire from Eng|land. The apartments are &s;plendid and lofty, adorn|ed with elegant furniture, and a great number of valuable paintings. The gardens at the ea&s;t end of the hou&s;e are well laid out, and kept in good order; and towards the &s;outh there is a park &s;ix miles in circuit, &s;urrounded with a &s;tone wall, furni&s;hed with deer, and diver&s;ified with clumps of fir, thro' which many beautiful vi&s;tas are opened <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This elegant &s;eat was entirely con&s;umed by fire in the year 1755.</NOTE>. The earl of Moray re&s;ides at Dinniber&s;el, a noble &s;eat in the neighbourhood of Aberdour, with exten&s;ive gar|dens, and terrace walks &s;tretching down to the &s;ea|&s;ide. Wemys ca&s;tle, belonging to the earl of Wemys, &s;tands at the mouth of the Forth, on the top of a

high cliff that commands a very exten&s;ive pro&s;|pect both by land and &s;ea. The building is of free&s;tone, and extends two hundred feet in front, having a terrace on the top of a rock, like that at Wind&s;or. The hou&s;e is furni&s;hed in a magnifi|cent ta&s;te, and &s;urrounded with large gardens, parks, and plantations. The earl of Leven's hou&s;e, at Melvil, is a large &s;tately quadrangle, with a noble avenue and large fir plantation. At the we&s;t end of Lochleven &s;tands the hou&s;e of Kinro&s;s, belonging to Sir John Hope Bruce, which is the mo&s;t beautiful and regular piece of architecture in all Scotland, planned by Sir William Bruce, &s;ur|veyor general of the works in that kingdom, and architect of the palace of Holy-rood-hou&s;e at Edinburgh. The hou&s;e of Kinro&s;s is built of fine white free&s;tone, adorned with columns of the Corinthian order, and crowned with a noble lan|thorn at top: the offices under ground are vaulted, and the apartments above elegantly di&s;po&s;ed.

<HEAD>STIRLINGSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Stirling or Striveling, extending twenty miles in length and twelve in breadth, is bounded on the we&s;t by part of Lennox and Clyd&s;|dale; on the ea&s;t by Clackmannan&s;hire and the river Forth; on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t by Lothian; and on the north by Monteith. The face of the country is open and agreeable, diver&s;ified in hill and dale, &s;haded with woods and plantations; well watered with &s;treams and rivers, the chief of which is the Forth or Bodotria, ri&s;ing in the neighbour|hood of an high mountain called Ben-Lomond, and running ea&s;tward into the Frith of Edin|burgh.
<PB N="89" REF="910">
The &s;outhern part is hilly, affording plenty of game and pa&s;turage for &s;heep, hor&s;es, and black cattle. The ea&s;tern part is fertile, produ|cing plentiful harve&s;ts of corn, and great abun|dance of coal. Lead ore is found in different parts of the &s;hire, which is full of agreeable &s;eats be|longing to the noblility and gentry; and the lakes and rivers teem with pike, trout, and &s;almon.</P>
<P>The people are chiefly Lowlanders, and pre&s;|byterians; and live by farming, fi&s;hing, or the weaving manufacture. Stirling, the capital of the county, which derives its name from <HI>Ster,</HI> a Saxon word, &s;ignifying hill, and <HI>lin,</HI> water, was antiently called Binobara, of the &s;ame &s;ignification in the Scotti&s;h language. The town, which is large and populous, &s;tands about thirty miles from Edin|burgh, on the de&s;cent of a hill, the top of which is crowned with a &s;tately old ca&s;tle, of which the earls of Mar were formerly hereditary ca&s;tellans, kept in repair and garri&s;oned by the government. The town is inclo&s;ed with a wall, except towards the north, where the part of a fo&s;&s;e is &s;upplied by the river Forth, over which the inhabitants have built a &s;tone bridge, con&s;i&s;ting of four &s;tately arches, and &s;ecured with an iron gate. As Stirling is counted an important pa&s;s into the Highlands, the ca&s;tle, which is naturally &s;trong, has been &s;treng|thened with new batteries and ramparts, and well &s;upplied with artillery. In the late rebellion it was defended by general Blakeney, at the head of a &s;mall garri&s;on, again&s;t the rebel army, which un|dertook the &s;iege of it; but relinqui&s;hed their de|&s;ign at the approach of the king's forces. The royal apartments within the ca&s;tle, built by king James V. are &s;pacious and magnificent, adorned with carved work and figures in &s;tucco upon the ceiling; and, in a word, inferior to none in Eu|rope. To the&s;e belong a noble hall, roofed
<PB N="90" REF="920">
with Iri&s;h oak, like that of We&s;tmin&s;ter, in which amba&s;&s;adors had their audience, and the parliament was often a&s;&s;embled. The citadel was formerly provided with a church for the garri&s;on and king's retinue, as well as with a private chapel in the palace for the royal family. Above the king's apartments there are elegant lodgings for the go|vernor; and without the walls there is a large park belonging to the ca&s;tle. The town is nobly &s;ituated, well built, upon the declivity of a hill, which commands a pro&s;pect of the charming wind|ings of the Forth, as well as of Edinburgh ca&s;tle, the town of Alloway, a great number of fine &s;eats, and di&s;tant views of other counties. The principal &s;treet is large and hand&s;ome; the market-place is &s;pacious; and the town hou&s;e a &s;tately building: in the upper part, to the ea&s;tward, appears the great church, a lofty edifice, with a very high tower. The earl of Mar's palace on the top of the hill over-again&s;t the town hou&s;e, and a fine &s;eat near the ca&s;tle, belonging to the duke of Argyle, contribute greatly to the beauty of the place. Stirling is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery; has a weekly market well &s;upplied; is admirably &s;ituated for trade in the centre of Scotland, on a navigable river; af|fords divers manufactories of linens and &s;halloons; and gives the title of earl to the family of Alex|ander. Sir William Alexander prevailed upon king James I. of England to in&s;titute the order of the knights of Nova Scotia, and he was afterwards en|nobled; and in the &s;equel, king Charles I. ad|vanced him to the dignity of earl of Stirling. This family fell into decay, and their &s;eat was purcha&s;ed by the grandfather of the pre&s;ent duke of Argyle.

and under an hawthorn tree hard by the&s;e ruins, lies the body of king James III. who was defeated in this neighbourhood by his own nobility, and &s;lain in his flight from the battle, which was fought at Bannockburn. This place is al&s;o fa|mous for the overthrow of the Engli&s;h army com|manded by Edward II. amounting to one hundred thou&s;and fighting men. They were here encountered by Robert de Brus with le&s;s than one third of that number, and &s;u&s;tained the greate&s;t defeat that ever happened to the Engli&s;h &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the monarchy. The earl of Warrenne, before this period, had been defeated by Wallace, in attempt|ing to pa&s;s the river with his army, by a wooden bridge in the neighbourhood of Stirling. Falkirk, &s;ituated at the di&s;tance of eight miles from Stir|ling, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Frith, is a &s;mall neat market-town of great antiquity, built upon the Roman wall of Antoninus, which extended &s;ix and thirty miles acro&s;s this i&s;thmus, from the Frith of Forth to the river Clyde, in the neighbour|hood of Dumbarton. Falkirk, which had been famous for a great victory obtained by the Engli&s;h over Wallace and two other Scotti&s;h generals, was rendered &s;till more remarkable in the year 1745, by the defeat of the king's troops, who were here routed by the young pretender, at the head of his Highland army. Exten&s;ive ruins are perceived in the neighbourhood of this town, &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome antiquarians to have been the capital of the Picti&s;h government; but others, with more rea&s;on, believe them to be the remains of &s;ome &s;tations belonging to the famous Roman work which is &s;till vi&s;ible within three miles of Falkirk, and ap|pears to have con&s;i&s;ted of two ramparts, two ditches, and a cau&s;eway, provided at proper di&s;tances with &s;tations or forts that were garri&s;oned, &s;quare watch towers, and exploratory turrets; and running from

Kirkpatrick in Dumbarton&s;hire, to the hou&s;e of Carrin, on the River Forth, about two miles to the we&s;tward of Abercorn. On the north &s;ide of the river Carron are two round artificial mounts, called Duni Pacis, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been rai&s;ed as monuments of a peace concluded between the Romans and the Caledonions; but more likely to be exploratory mounts, &s;uch as are found at other places in the cour&s;e of Antoninus's wall, vul|garly called Graeme's Dyke. At the di&s;tance of two miles and an half more ea&s;terly, near the end of the i&s;thmus, appeared the famous Sacellum, known by the name of Arthur's Oven, and called by Buchannan <HI>Templum Termini,</HI> the mo&s;t intire and curious monument of Roman antiquity that re|mained in Great Britain. It was built of hewn free&s;tone, without lime or mortar, the wall being about three feet in thickne&s;s, of a round cylindrical form, and open at top, two and twenty feet high, twenty-eight feet in external diameter, norrowing upwards to the aperture, the diameter of which amounted to eleven feet &s;ix inches. This building &s;tood on the declivity of a ri&s;ing-ground, &s;up|ported by a ba&s;ement of &s;tones projecting from below, as a foundation to the edifice, which was provided with an arched door, a window, and a double cornice. Various have been the conjectures concerning the u&s;e of this building, which mo&s;t hi&s;torians and antiquarians &s;uppo&s;e to have been a temple or place of wor&s;hip, though they have widely differed in their opinion about the deity to which it was dedicated. The author of the Itine|rarium Septentrionale, has a&s;&s;igned&s;ome rea&s;ons for believing it to have been a &s;acellum or chapel con|tiguous to the camp of Agricola, in which the vexilla or en&s;igns of the legions were depo&s;ited.

Along the tract of the Roman military way, we find the remains of &s;everal forts or ca&s;tella, and a great many &s;tones with Roman in&s;criptions, dug out of the great val|lum, are &s;till pre&s;erved in the college of Gla&s;gow, and in the cabinets of the curious.

<HEAD>DUMBARTONSHIRE, or LENNOX.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Dumbarton, &s;tretching four and twenty miles in length and twenty in breadth, is bounded on the &s;outh with the river and frith of Clyde; on the we&s;t by Lochlong and Argyle&s;hire; on the north by the Grampian Hills; and on the ea&s;t by Monteith and Stirling&s;hire. Great part of this county con&s;i&s;ts of hills and heath, fit for no|thing but pa&s;turage and &s;port; even in the lower lands the &s;oil is not extremely fertile: yet the face of the country is agreeably diver&s;ified with hill, dale, mountain, heath, &s;treams, lakes, woods, and fields of corn: the &s;hire is likewi&s;e beautified with a great number of agreeable &s;eats and plantations, belong|ing to gentlemen of fortune. Part of this county is wa&s;hed by the river Clyde in its cour&s;e to the &s;ea: even at the ca&s;tle of Dumbarton, the breadth of it amounts to two miles at high water, and it continues extending in width and depth until it joins the ocean. From the mouth of the Clyde, the two bays of Lochlong and Lochfyn, make large indentations in the &s;hire of Dumbarton. The only river of any con&s;ideration that runs through this county, is the Leven, the Lelanonius of Ptolomy, otherwi&s;e called Levinia, the Latin name for Len|nox, an appellation by which Dumbarton&s;hire is often di&s;tingui&s;hed. The river Leven is a pure tran&s;parent pa&s;toral &s;tream, that warbles o'er a bed of pebbles, through a delightful vale adorned with farms, &s;eats, woods, and plantations. It derives its origin from the great lake called Lochlomond, of which indeed it is the overflowing, and, after a delightful meandring cour&s;e of five or &s;ix miles, di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Clyde at the ca&s;tle of Dumbarton. But the greate&s;t curio&s;ity of this county is Lochlomond it&s;elf, a va&s;t body of fre&s;h water,
<PB N="95" REF="970">
&s;upplied by &s;ubterraneous &s;prings and rivulets, &s;ur|rounded with huge mountains, extending five and twenty miles in length, and in &s;ome places five miles in breadth, incredibly deep in every part, inter&s;per&s;ed with four and twenty verdant i&s;les, &s;ome of which are &s;tocked with red deer, and in|habited. Nothing can be more wildly romantic than this part of the country during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake: the high road runs in &s;ome places through natural woods, overhung on one hand by &s;teep mountains, covered with flowery heath; and on the other opening in long vi&s;tas upon the lake, terminated by green i&s;lands that &s;eem to float upon the water. Among the rivers of this &s;hire we &s;hall likewi&s;e mention the water of Blane, which, though it&s;elf an incon|&s;iderable &s;tream, hath been rendered famous by the birth of George Buchannan, the celebrated Latin poet and hi&s;torian. He was born on the north &s;ide of the lake, not far from the place called Bu|channan, where we may behold an elegant &s;eat be|longing to the duke of Montro&s;e, head of the noble family of Graham, &s;o often di&s;tingui&s;hed by its loyalty, integrity, and valour. The &s;ame part of the country gave birth to the great mathematician and naturali&s;t, Napier lord Merchi&s;ton, inventor of the logarithms. The title of Lennox, with the property of great part of the &s;hire, was heretofore ve&s;ted in a branch of the royal family of Stuart, with which it was reunited in the per&s;on of king James VI. who&s;e father, Henry lord Darnley, was &s;on to the duke of Lennox. This prince confer|red the title upon his kin&s;man E&s;me Stuart, &s;on of John lord D'aubigney in France: but, his race failing at the death of Charles, duke of Lednox and Richmond, and the e&s;tate devolving to the crown, king Charles II. conferred both titles on his own natural &s;on, by the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth;

and they are &s;till enjoyed by his po&s;terity. The people of Dumbarton&s;hire are chiefly Lowlanders, though in &s;ome parts of it divine &s;ervice is per|formed in the Er&s;e language. The mo&s;t numerous clans in this di&s;trict, are the Macfarlans, the Col|quhouns, and the Buchannans. They generally profe&s;s the prote&s;tant faith, according to the pre&s;|byterian di&s;cipline; yet &s;ome of the gentlemen fol|low the Engli&s;h ritual. The commonalty are for the mo&s;t part &s;ober, hone&s;t, and indu&s;trious; and though they live poorly, are tall, vigorous, and healthy. Near the mounts called Duni Pacis, &s;tands the burgh of Kyl&s;yth, famous for a great victory obtained in this neighbourhood, over the pre&s;by|terians, by James, the great marquis of Montro&s;e. Kyl&s;yth gave the title of vicount to a branch of the family of Leving&s;tone; but the title is now for|feited by attainder. Callender ca&s;tle, in the ea&s;tern part of Stirling&s;hire, belonged to the chief of the &s;ame family, Leving&s;tone, earl of Linlithgow and Callendar. At the village of Cumbernauld, &s;tands the &s;eat which belonged to Fleming, late earl of Wigtoun; and in the neighbourhood is the hou&s;e of Elphing&s;ton, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the baron of that name.</P>
<P>Dumbarton, the county-town, which be&s;tows its name upon the &s;hire, is a &s;mall incon&s;iderable royal burrough, &s;ituated near the conflux of the Clyde and Leven; and at pre&s;ent remarkable for nothing but its ca&s;tle, which has been de&s;cribed by the pens of Buchannan and Cambden. It is a &s;teep rock, ri&s;ing up in two points, and every where in|acce&s;&s;ible except by a very narrow pa&s;&s;age or entry, fortified with a &s;trong wall and rampart. Within this wall is the guard-hou&s;e, with lodgings for the officers; and from hence a long flight of &s;tone &s;teps a&s;cends to the upper part of the ca&s;tle, where there are &s;everal batteries mounted with cannon,
<PB N="97" REF="990">
the wall being continued almo&s;t round the rock. In the middle of this upper part where the rock divides, there are commodious barracks, with a deep well, in which there is always plenty of water. Here likewi&s;e are the remains of a gateway, and pro|digious high wall, at the top of which there was a wooden bridge of communication from one rock to another. This gateway was &s;ometimes blocked up during the inte&s;tine commotions of Scotland, &s;o that garri&s;ons of different factions po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed diffe|rent parts of the ca&s;tle, and each had a gate to|wards the water. The ca&s;tle &s;tands in the angle formed by the Clyde and Leven at their conflux, &s;o that it is wholly &s;urrounded with water, except a narrow i&s;thmus, which with every &s;pring tide is overflowed: nor is there any hill or eminence with|in a long mile of this fortre&s;s. It commands the navigation of the Clyde, and being deemed the key of the We&s;tern Highlands, is kept in &s;ome repair, and garri&s;oned with invalids, under the command of a governor and &s;ome &s;ubaltern officers. The government of it, worth 365 l. a year, is at pre&s;ent ve&s;ted in the honourable colonel Archibald Mont|gomery, brother to the earl of Eglintoun The little town of Dumbarton, which &s;tands in the neighbour|hood of the ca&s;tle, on the banks of the Leven, was of old a flouri&s;hing city, capital of the Cumbrian king|dom of the Britons, and for a con&s;iderable length of time under the immediate protection of the Roman &s;tationary camp, maintained to defend the wall of Antoninus or Graeme's Dyke, which ends or be|gins at Kirkpatrick, within three miles of Dum|barton. The antient inhabitants called that place Alcluith, from the ca&s;tle &s;tanding on the bank of the Cluith or Clyde: but the Scots and Picts gave it the name of Dunbrittan, or ca&s;tle of the Britons, from which it was corrupted into Dumbarton. In the eighth century it was reduced by the Sax|ons under Egbert, king of Northumberland, a&s;&s;i&s;ted

by the Picti&s;h king Onu&s;t; it afterwards fell into the hands of the Scots, and for &s;ome time carried on a con&s;iderable traffic: but great part of it was de&s;troyed by an inundation, and it met with va|rious other di&s;a&s;ters; in con&s;equence of which it is dwindled into a little incon&s;iderable borough, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by the garri&s;on, the gram|mar &s;chool, which has been always in &s;ome reputa|tion, a &s;mall fi&s;hery, and &s;ome piddling efforts in the way of trade and manufacture.

<P>The &s;hire of Renfrew, or Reinfraw, &s;tiled the Barony by way of eminence, becau&s;e it was the an|tient inheritance of the Stuarts, is a &s;mall county, extending about twenty miles from north to &s;outh, and thirteen from ea&s;t to we&s;t, parted from Dum|barton&s;hire by the river Clyde on the we&s;t; bor|dering on the ea&s;t with Lanerk&s;hire; and on the north with Cunningham. The face of the coun|try is varied with hill and vale, wood and &s;tream; crowded with populous villages, and adorned with the &s;eats of gentlemen. The &s;oil is in general fertile, producing rye, barley, oats, pea&s;e, beans, flax, and &s;ome wheat; it likewi&s;e yields plenty of coal and turf for fuel; and affords abundance of pa&s;turage for &s;heep and cattle. The inhabitants are Lowlanders, and pre&s;byterians, wealthy and indu&s;trious, addicted to traffic, and particularly ex|pert in the linen manufacture. Their genius is &s;timulated to commerce, by the example of their neighbours of Gla&s;gow, as well as the convenience of the river and frith of Clyde, along the cour&s;e of which they are &s;ituated. Renfrew, the county
<PB N="99" REF="1010">
town, &s;tanding on the &s;mall river Cathcart, which flows into the Clyde at the di&s;tance of five miles from Gla&s;gow, is a &s;mall but antient royal borough, the &s;eat of the &s;heriff's court and of a pre&s;bytery. The town is neatly built, and the inhabitants enjoy a tolerable &s;hare of commerce. But it yields greatly in point of importance to the village of Pai&s;ley, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, four times as large as Ren|frew, and flouri&s;hing by means of the linen ma|nufacture. It &s;tands about three miles from Ren|frew, on the little river of Cart, over which the in|habitants have built a &s;tone bridge; and is famous for its abbey, founded in the twelfth century by Alexander II. high &s;teward of Scotland. It was in&s;tituted for monks of the order of Cluny, who for many ages continued a chronicon of the nation, known by the name of the black book of Pai&s;ley, which agreed in every material fact with the Scoti-Chronicon of Fordun, and is by &s;ome people &s;up|po&s;ed to be the &s;ame performance. At the refor|mation, the abbey, with all its dependencies, was given to the family of Hamilton, who converted it into a lodging hou&s;e; and it afterwards became the property of the earl of Dundonald, who&s;e male i&s;&s;ue failing, the title has devolved to another branch of the family of Cochran. Pai&s;ley gives the title of baron to the earls of Abercorn, the fir&s;t of whom was a younger &s;on of the due de Chatel|heraut. It &s;tands upon the de&s;cent of a ri&s;ing ground that &s;lopes from the praetorium of a Roman camp, fortified with fo&s;&s;es and ramparts, which &s;eem to have encompa&s;&s;ed all the ground on which the town is now built. The area of the praetorium, when walked upon, emits a hollow &s;ound, ari&s;ing probably from &s;ubterranean vaults. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from hence we &s;ee two &s;mall tumuli, &s;up|po&s;ed to have been &s;tations for the advanced guards of the camp. In the neighbourhood of Pai&s;ley,

there is a remarkable &s;pring which ebbs and flows with the tide, though it is &s;ituated much higher than the &s;urface of the river. On the &s;ide of the Frith, about ten miles below Renfrew, the mer|chants of Gla&s;gow have built a neat little &s;ea-port town, called Port Gla&s;gow, with a commodious har|bour for the reception of large &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els that cannot &s;ail up the river. Two miles nearer the &s;ea, &s;tands Greenock, a thriving well-built hand|&s;ome town, having a &s;ecure harbour formed by three noble &s;tone piers or quays, extending a con|&s;iderable way into the &s;ea, and connected along &s;hore by a large elegant wharf, on which the mer|chants have built a range of neat warehou&s;es for merchandize. Greenock lies &s;o near the ocean, and its harbour is &s;o acce&s;&s;ible and &s;ecure, that the greater part of the Gla&s;gow &s;hipping deliver their cargoes, and are loaded again at this town; &s;o that the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s is transferred hither from Gla&s;gow. The place is adorned with an elegant cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and commanded by a fine &s;eat built on the top of an eminence, that &s;eems to overhang the town. This noble hou&s;e, with large parks and plantations, belonged to Sir John Shaw, at who&s;e death it de|volved to his grand&s;on, lord Cathcart. Almo&s;t adjoining to Greenock, we pa&s;s through the village of Crawfurd's Dyke; and on the we&s;t &s;ide, near the mouth of the Frith, and at the entrance of a fair bay, &s;tands Gourock, a &s;mall fi&s;hing town, having the advantage of a tolerable road and har|bour. The &s;ides of the Frith and river of Clyde are beautified with &s;everal hand&s;ome villas; of the&s;e the mo&s;t remarkable is Findla&s;tone, belonging to the noble family of Cunningham, earl of Glencairne.

<HEAD>LANERKSHIRE, or CLUYDSDALE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Lanerk, otherwi&s;e called Cluyd&s;dale, from the river Clyde, by which it is watered, &s;tretches forty miles in length from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t, and four and twenty at its utmo&s;t breadth. It is bounded on the &s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh by Anandale and Dum|fries&s;hire; on the north-we&s;t and north by Renfrew|&s;hire and Lennox; on the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t by Linlithgow&s;hire and Sterling&s;hire; and on the &s;outh-ea&s;t by part of Mid-Lothian. It is divided into two di&s;tricts, called the upper and nether ward; the fir&s;t, which is roughened with hills and barren heaths, may be denominated the &s;hire of Lanerk; the other be di&s;tingui&s;hed as the barony of Gla&s;gow. The Clyde derives its &s;ource in the upper ward from Errick Hill, which likewi&s;e gives ri&s;e to the Tweed and the Annan; and the&s;e three rivers pur&s;ue different cour&s;es. The Clyde falls into the Deucaledonian &s;ea; the Annan di&s;charges it&s;elf into Solway Frith; and the Tweed runs into the German ocean. The country of Cluyd&s;dale, though in &s;ome places barren, mountainous, and embrowned with heath, is in general plea&s;ant and fertile, exhibiting intermingled land&s;kips of wood and water, hill and valley. Even the naked moun|tains are rich in minerals, producing abundance of lead ore, impregnated with a large proportion of
<PB N="102" REF="1040">
&s;ilver. Such are the mines belonging to the duke of Queen&s;berry, and the earl of Hopton, at the lead hills wa&s;hed by the rivulet of Wanlock, which employ &s;ome thou&s;ands of hands, and en|rich the proprietors. On the &s;ides of the Wanlock, among the &s;and and &s;oil &s;wept down from the mountains by torrents, the labourers find often &s;mall pieces of pure virgin gold; certain &s;igns that there mu&s;t be a gold mine in that neighbourhood. Little bits and particles of the &s;ame precious metal have been found in Crawford Moor, together with large pieces of lapis lazuli. In the reign of James VI. Cornelius, a German alchymi&s;t, found a gold mine at Crawford John in this county, from whence, in thirty days, he &s;ent half a &s;tone weight of pure metal to the mint at Edinburgh. Cluyd&s;dale is for the mo&s;t part a corn country, abounding with oats, barley, rye, and producing a con&s;iderable quantity of wheat; while the hilly parts afford ex|cellent pa&s;turage and plenty of game. It yields al&s;o great &s;tore of free&s;tone, lime&s;tone, excellent coal, together with peat and turf for fuel. It is adorned with a great number of agreeable &s;eats; nor is it deficient in Roman antiquities: for it is penetrated from one end to the other by a Roman cau&s;eway or military way called Watling-&s;treet, running from Gruk&s;tone to the borders of Ren|frew. Cluyd&s;dale and Lanerk give the titles of marquis and earl to the duke of Hamilton, who&s;e fortune and influence lie chiefly in this province, which is noted for the number of its gentlemen landholders. Cluyd&s;dale is very populous, inha|bited by Lowlanders, who profe&s;s the pre&s;byterian religion, in which they have &s;ignalized their zeal even to a degree of fanatici&s;m. The &s;hire being an inland country, the common people chiefly em|ploy them&s;elves in farming, breeding &s;heep and cattle, and in the linen manufacture. Lanerk, the

At the di&s;tance of ten miles from Lanerk &s;tand the ca&s;tle and burgh of Crawfurd Town, remark|able for nothing but giving the title of earl to the noble family of Lind&s;ay: a title, which by the death of the late earl, has now devolved to the vi&s;count of Garnock, &s;prung from the &s;ame hou&s;e, though his &s;urname is changed from Lind&s;ey to Crawford, in con&s;equence of a marriage. But the chief place of Lanerk&s;hire, and indeed the great emporium of the we&s;t of Scotland, is the large, elegant, and flouri&s;hing city of Gla&s;gow, containing near thirty thou&s;and inhabitants. It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated, about thirty miles from Edinburgh, on the de&s;cent of a gentle eminence, and the adjacent plain, ex|tending to the banks of the river Clyde, over which there is a &s;tately &s;tone bridge of &s;even arches. The greater part of this fine city is laid out in a regular plan, the &s;treets cro&s;&s;ing each other at right angles. The hou&s;es are in general lofty, built of hewn &s;tone, and near the cro&s;s, or market-place, &s;upported upon arched pillars, which form a commodious pi|azza before the &s;hops, and give an air of noblene&s;s to the buildings. The &s;treets are well paved,

clean, &s;traight, and &s;pacious: in a word, Gla&s;gow is the mo&s;t beautiful town of Great Britain, adorn|ed with a great number of public edifices, &s;uch as the cathedral and five or &s;ix other elegant churches, the tolbooth, town hall, and &s;everal ho&s;pitals, who&s;e lofty turrets and &s;pires yield a magnificent pro&s;pect at a di&s;tance. In the highe&s;t part of the city &s;tands the cathedral, a va&s;t pile of Gothic building, dedicated to St. Mungo or Kentigern, who was bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow in the &s;ixth century, and here lies buried between four pillars. Nothing can be more &s;tupendous than the architecture of this cathedral, ornamented with two &s;pires, one of which ri&s;ing from a &s;quare tower in the middle of the cro&s;s, is &s;urpri&s;ingly high and beautiful. In the other, there is a bell of va&s;t dimen&s;ions, which when tolled, &s;hakes the whole fabrick. This pile of building is now divided into three &s;eparate churches, where divine &s;ervice is performed every Sunday. Hard by the cathedral we &s;ee the ruins of a ca&s;tle, which was the archiepi&s;copal palace, when Gla&s;gow was the &s;ee of a metropolitan: it is now the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery and provincial &s;ynod. The churches are all &s;tately buildings, and &s;ome of them are built on the be&s;t models of architec|ture: but one of the greate&s;t ornaments of Gla&s;|gow is the univer&s;ity, con&s;i&s;ting of one college, founded in the year 1453, by king James II. of Scotland, in con&s;equence of a bull from pope Nicholas V. ve&s;ted with all the privileges and honours which had been granted by the apo&s;toli|cal &s;ee to that of Bononia. The edifice, con&s;i&s;ting of an outward and inner &s;quare, with a lofty tower and front of hewn &s;tone towards the city, was built in the year 1454, at the expence of William Turnbull, bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, and is a noble monu|ment of that prelate's munificence. At the ori|ginal in&s;titution it was compo&s;ed of a rector, a dean of faculty, a principal, or warden, to teach
<PB N="105" REF="1080">
theology, and three profe&s;&s;ors of philo&s;ophy: in the &s;equel there was an e&s;tabli&s;hment for &s;ome cler|gymen to give lectures on the civil and canon law. In the reign of James VI. the in&s;titution was chan|ged, the foundation improved by a new charter and grants, which were afterwards confirmed by that king's &s;on and grand&s;on. Divers arch|bi&s;hops, noblemen, gentlemen, and private eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, have been benefactors to this univer&s;ity, which is well provided with able profe&s;&s;ors in the different branches of theology, mathematics, phi|lo&s;ophy, and the languages. Every branch is taught by its own &s;eparate regent or profe&s;&s;or, who, not contented with giving general lectures, attends a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to the bu&s;ine&s;s of his cla&s;s, where he explains, &s;ets ta&s;ks, and examines his pupils like any other &s;chool-ma&s;ter: be&s;ides, the individuals of every cla&s;s undergo a public examination an|nually, in pre&s;ence of all the regents; and provided they be found duly qualified, are admitted to the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, after a certain &s;tanding. Here are likewi&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of the civil law, church hi&s;tory, Hebrew, medicine, anatomy, and botany; &s;o that, upon the whole, the college of Gla&s;gow may be deemed the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing univer&s;ity in Scotland. Be&s;ides the divinity hall, the old li|brary, and the common hall, which are large and &s;pacious, the inner quadrangle contains a great number of commodious apartments for the &s;tudents. The faculty has lately built an hand&s;ome library, which is pretty well filled with books and manu|&s;cripts; and here are depo&s;ited many &s;tones with Roman in&s;criptions, brought from the wall of An|toninus. The regents for the mo&s;t part live in an elegant row of hou&s;es, a little detached from the college; and behind there is a plea&s;ant garden laid out in walks for the benefit of all the members of the univer&s;ity. Adjoining to this, there is a bo|tanical
<PB N="106" REF="1090">
garden well &s;upplied with &s;imples, cla&s;&s;ed alphabetically in their different tribes. The pro|fe&s;&s;ors, while in the exerci&s;e of their functions, wear black gowns with open &s;leeves, and the &s;tudents are all di&s;tingui&s;hed by red or &s;carlet gowns, with|out which they are not allowed to appear in publick. Many ancient profe&s;&s;ors have taught, and a great number of learned men have been produced in this univer&s;ity; the rector&s;hip of which being annually elective, is always ve&s;ted in &s;ome nobleman or per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed fortune. The tolbooth, or public jail of Gla&s;gow, is a venerable Gothic building, provided with chimes that play certain tunes at &s;tated periods, by means of a barrel; and are be&s;ides played upon a whole hour every day, by a per&s;on hired for that purpo&s;e, the bells being furni&s;hed with keys like tho&s;e of an harp&s;ichord. Adjoining to the tolbooth, the citizens have built a magnificent town hall; and on the &s;treet before it, &s;tands an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of king William III. They have likewi&s;e taken in a piece of ground called the Green, that &s;kirts the river, and planted it with trees for a publick walk to the inhabitants. The harbour is no more than a &s;imple wharf or quay for the convenience of &s;mall craft, as no ve&s;|&s;el of any burthen can come &s;o far up the river. At a &s;mall di&s;tance above the harbour, &s;tands the town workhou&s;e, with an infirmary, built with elegant &s;implicity. The in&s;titution is founded upon an excellent plan, conducted with great &s;a|gacity, and proves &s;uch an effectual provi&s;ion for the poor, that there is not a beggar to be &s;een within the precincts of Gla&s;gow. The people of this city are remarkable for their indu&s;try, their commercial &s;pirit, their punctual ob&s;ervance of the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline, and their &s;teady attachment to the reigning family, which they have more than once &s;ignalized in a very extraordinary man|ner:
<PB N="107" REF="1100">
yet here too, there are &s;ome epi&s;copalians, who have erected a neat meeting hou&s;e, in which the Engli&s;h &s;ervice is performed. The merchants of Gla&s;gow are wealthy and adventurous. They have e&s;tabli&s;hed a great number of manufactures in different branches of traffic, which produce great quantities of linen, checks, &s;tockings, inkle, and almo&s;t every commodity which formerly they fetched from Manche&s;ter and other parts of Eng|land. They have built mills for &s;plitting iron, and forges for making nails. They refine &s;ugar, and di&s;til &s;pirit from the dregs, or mola&s;&s;es; and pro|&s;ecute tobacco through all the operations to which that plant is &s;ubject after its importation. They &s;end annually a con&s;iderable number of &s;hips to Virginia and the &s;ugar i&s;lands, where their agents keep &s;tores &s;upplied with their own manufactures. They equip yearly &s;ome ve&s;&s;els for the whale fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t of Greenland, and extend their commerce to the Baltic, and all the Ea&s;t country. Their commerce increa&s;es every day, and flouri&s;hes the more by the favour of their &s;ituation &s;o near the &s;ea, that their &s;hips are immediately di&s;entan|gled of the land, and fairly entered in the Atlantic ocean. In con&s;equence of this advantage, their voyages are le&s;s indangered in time of war, and much more &s;hort than tho&s;e undertaken from Lon|don and other places in the Briti&s;h channel, through which the navigation is tedious and hazardous, both from the winds and the enemy. Their &s;hips are cleared and delivered at Greenock and Port Gla&s;gow, near the mouth of the Frith, and the cargoes &s;ent up the river in lighters to Gla&s;gow.</P>
<P>The &s;hallowne&s;s of the Clyde from Dumbarton ca&s;tle upwards, has been found &s;uch an ob&s;truction to trade, that they have re&s;olved to deepen the channel by contracting the banks, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing locks in certain places: a laudable re|&s;olution,
<PB N="108" REF="1110">
which we hope will be executed with &s;pirit and dexterity.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the river, about two miles above Gla&s;gow, &s;tands the town of Rutherglen, a royal borough, ill built, dirty, &s;mall, and in|con&s;iderable. Hamilton, &s;ituated about eight miles higher up the river, is a large plea&s;ant vil|lage, well built and populous, deriving its name from the duke of Hamilton, who&s;e palace &s;tands at one end of the town. It is a modern build|ing of hewn &s;tone, con&s;i&s;ting of a corps du logis, and two wings, &s;uitable in grandeur and magni|ficence to the dignity of the owner, who is the fir&s;t duke of Scotland. The apartments are &s;pa|cious and lofty, adorned with elegant furniture, and many excellent pieces of painting. The park is walled round, &s;even miles in compa&s;s, &s;tocked with fallow deer, well planted with oaks, firs, and other trees, and watered by the plea&s;ant river Aven, which runs through this inclo&s;ure, and falls into the Clyde. On the &s;ide of this &s;tream, over|hung with woods, &s;tands the &s;ummer hou&s;e of Barncluith, on the top of an eminence, from which to the river appear &s;even hanging terrace walks, one over another. In a word, whether we con&s;ider the palace, the offices, the gardens, or the park, every thing is noble and princely. At the di&s;tance of two miles from Hamilton, we &s;ee the ruins of Bothwell ca&s;tle, &s;tanding on the banks of the Clyde; and in the neighbourhood, the bridge of that name, rendered famous for the defeat of the fanaticks, who were routed in this place by the duke of Monmouth, in the reign of the &s;econd Charles. They had taken up arms in con&s;equence of &s;ome re&s;trictions which they inter|preted into religious oppre&s;&s;ion; but being de&s;ti|tute of leaders, and unacquainted with di&s;cipline, they fled at the fir&s;t on&s;et. Hard by the ca&s;tle of
<PB N="109" REF="1120">
Bothwell &s;tands the hou&s;e of Forfar, in which the late earl of that name re&s;ided; and in the neigh|bouring church there are &s;ome &s;tately tombs be|longing to the Douglas family. At the death of the late earl, who was &s;lain in the battle of Dum|blane, this hou&s;e and e&s;tate reverted to the duke of Douglas, from who&s;e family he had de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, and the other hou&s;es we have men|tioned, there is in Clyde&s;dale a great number of &s;eats and ca&s;tles, &s;uch as that of Ca&s;tle Crawford, belonging to the earl of Selkirk; Bog-hall, where the late earl of Wigtoun &s;ometimes re&s;ided; We&s;ter-hall and Carmichael, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the earl of Hyndford; and Blantyre, from whence the nobleman of that name derives his title.</P>

<HEAD>LINLITHGOWSHIRE, or WEST LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;mall county, not exceeding fourteen miles in length, and thirteen in breadth, is bounded on the north by part of Sterling&s;hire and the river Forth; by part of Cluyd&s;dale on the we&s;t; and on the &s;outh and we&s;t by Mid-Lothian, from which it is divided by the rivers Breich and Almond. The country is plea&s;ant and fertile, abounding with corn and pa&s;turage. Here is found plenty of coal, lime|&s;tone, and lead ore; nay, in the reign of James VI. it produced a rich mine of &s;ilver. The chief town, Linlithgow, from which it borrows the name, is a royal borough and &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, &s;tanding on the &s;ide of a &s;mall lake, about eighteen miles from Edinburgh: it con&s;i&s;ts of one open &s;treet, from whence lanes are detached on both &s;ides; the hou&s;es are built of &s;tone, tolerably neat and commodious; and the place is adorned with &s;ome &s;tately public edifices. On the &s;ide of the lake &s;tands a royal palace, magnificently built of hewn &s;tone, begun by king James V. and perfected by his
<PB N="110" REF="1130">
grand&s;on. Within the inner court, which is larger than that of Hamilton, there is an artificial foun|tain, adorned with &s;tatues and water-works; and at each corner of the &s;quare a tower, with a range of fine apartments. Hard by the palace is the church of St. Michael, a noble &s;tructure, with a very high &s;teeple. The inhabitants carry on a great manu|facture of linen, and bleach it with the water of this lake, which is noted for its whitening qua|lity: they likewi&s;e enjoy a tolerable &s;hare of trade by means of a good harbour on the Forth, where they have built a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and magazines or warehou&s;es for the u&s;e of the merchants. Hard by this harbour &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Blackne&s;s, be|longing to the crown, formerly u&s;ed as a &s;tate pri&s;on, but now quite ruinous. The chiefs of the Leving&s;tone family were earls of Linlithgow and Calendar, hereditary keepers of the palace in this town, and hereditary con&s;tables of Blackne&s;s ca&s;tle. The la&s;t of the&s;e noblemen forfeited his e&s;tate, and honours, by engaging in the rebellion of the year 1716.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of two miles from Linlithgow &s;tands Burrough&s;tonne&s;s, on the &s;ame coa&s;t, a burgh of regality, con&s;i&s;ting of one &s;treet, built along the &s;hore. The people of this town export con&s;iderable quantities of coal and &s;alt, and main|tain &s;ome trade with France and Holland. This town holds of the duke of Hamilton, who&s;e ad|joining hou&s;e of Kenneil is a fine &s;eat, agreeably embelli&s;hed with wood and water. Abercorn, within four miles of Linlithgow, &s;ituated near the Frith, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Kebercurning of Bede, in who&s;e time here was a famous mona&s;tery. The family of Douglas once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a ca&s;tle at Aber|corn, which now belongs to the earl of Hopton, though it gives a title to the Iri&s;h branch of the Hamiltons. On this &s;pot the earl of Hopton has

<P>Torfichen, two miles from Linlithgow, is a &s;mall burgh of regality, where the knights of Malta formerly re&s;ided: it now gives the title of baron to the chief of the Sandilands. Three miles from Blackne&s;s is the Queen's Ferry, a &s;mall royal bo|rough, at the point of St. Margaret's Bay, deriving its name from this lady, queen of Scotland, who from hence u&s;ed to cro&s;s the Forth into Fife. It &s;till continues to be the common ferry from Lo|thian to that county, the Forth being here about two miles in breadth. In the middle there is a &s;mall rocky i&s;land called Inchgarvie, with the ruins of a ca&s;tle once mounted with artillery, which commanded the channel of both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Linlithgow&s;hire abounds with great hou&s;es, a|mong which we number Cragie Hall, belonging to the marquis of Annandale; Kirkhill, the &s;eat of the earl of Buchan; Newli&s;ton, where the late field|mar&s;hal earl of Stair re&s;ided; Carridden, apper|taining to the earl of Dalhou&s;ie; and Barnbougle, the re&s;idence of the earl of Ro&s;eberry.

<HEAD>EDINBURGHSHIRE, or WEST LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Edinburgh &s;tretching one and twenty miles in length, and of a different breadth at different places, from five to &s;ixteen miles, is bounded on the ea&s;t by Ea&s;t Lothian; on the we&s;t by the &s;hire of Linlithgow; on the &s;outh by Tweedale; and on the north by part of We&s;t Lo|thian and the Frith of Forth. The a&s;pect of the country is in general level and plea&s;ant, inter&s;per&s;ed with a few hills, that help to exhibit agreeable pro&s;|pects. It is well watered with rivers, and &s;haded
<PB N="112" REF="1160">
with woods. It produces plenty of coal, lime&s;tone, a &s;oft black marble, and &s;ome copper ore. The &s;oil, of it&s;elf fertile, is finely cultivated, and yields as plentiful harve&s;ts of excellent wheat, as are found in any part of Great Britain. The whole &s;hire is inter&s;per&s;ed with noble hou&s;es and plan|tations belonging to noblemen and gentlemen of fortune. The farmers are ma&s;ter of the &s;cience of agriculture, and wealthy in con&s;equence of their &s;kill, &s;ome of them paying five hundred pounds of yearly rent. The country is well inhabited, and pre&s;ents us with a good number of towns and populous villages. Along the &s;ea coa&s;t the common people &s;ub&s;i&s;t by fi&s;hing, and traffic in coals and &s;alt, and &s;ome few carry on a &s;muggling commerce. Tho&s;e in the inland are employed in farming, and &s;ome branches of the weaving ma|nufacture. The &s;heriffalty of this &s;hire is in the gift of the crown; and Edinburgh is a county in it&s;elf. This antient city, in Latin Edinum, the metropolis of Scotland, and heretofore the royal &s;eats of its kings and parliaments, &s;tands upon the declivity of an eminence, above a mile from the &s;ea coa&s;t, four hundred miles north of London, and together with its ca&s;tle forms a very noble appearance. The ca&s;tle &s;tands at the upper end, upon a &s;teep &s;olid rock that commands the city and the adjoining plains. It is as well for|tified with modern works as the nature of its &s;ituation would permit; well furni&s;hed with artil|lery and ammunition, and &s;upplied with a gar|ri&s;on of regular forces, detached from the regiment that is quartered in the &s;uburbs. This ca&s;tle has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Ca&s;trum alatum,</HI> but this name is of very ob&s;cure derivation; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e it derived the epithet <HI>alatum</HI> or winged, from two high rocks which &s;tand at a &s;mall di|&s;tance like wings, one on each &s;ide; that on the
<PB N="113" REF="1170">
right being called Sali&s;bury Craggs, the other Caltoun Craggs. In all probability the ca&s;tle was founded in the ninth century by Edwin, king of Northumberland, who&s;e dominions extended to the Frith of Forth; and having built this fortre&s;s, to defend his frontiers from the incur&s;ions of the Scots and Britons, it naturally took the name of Edwin's-burgh, or Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Within the precincts of the ca&s;tle there is a royal palace, with &s;ome noble apartments, in one of which king James VI. was born. Here the deputy governor re&s;ides; here the national magazine of arms and ammunition is kept; and here the re|galia with &s;ome old records are depo&s;ited. The place is provided with a chapel for the u&s;e of the garri&s;on; and furni&s;hed with two wells cut out of the &s;olid rock. The &s;ituation of this citadel is al|together imperial, commanding an exten&s;ive pro&s;|pect towards the mouth of the Frith; is &s;een at a great di&s;tance, and &s;aluted by every &s;hip of war that anchors in the road of Leith. Notwith&s;tand|ing its natural and artificial &s;trength, it has been reduced &s;everal times, and could not hold out three days again&s;t the modern art of be&s;ieging. In the year 1745, it was blocked up by the adherents of the young Pretender; but as he had no artillery nor engineers, and the deputy-governor fired upon the town, which lies immediately under the guns, he rai&s;ed the blockade at the reque&s;t of the inha|bitants. From the ca&s;tle gate and draw-bridge, a broad bank or terrace extends a few hundred paces to the beginning of the high &s;treet; this is called the Ca&s;tle Hill, u&s;ed as a public walk, on which the company take the air in &s;ummer, and enjoy a noble pro&s;pect on both &s;ides of the Frith. The High Street of Edinburgh, counted the mo&s;t &s;pa|cious in Europe, &s;tretches with an ea&s;y de&s;cent from the hither end of the Ca&s;tle Hill, a long mile in a direct line to the abbey or palace of Holy-rood-Hou&s;e,
<PB N="114" REF="1180">
which terminates this noble avenue: one half of this, however, belongs to the &s;uburbs called the Canon-gate, from a &s;ociety of canons regular, who founded the abbey. The High Street of Edinburgh, properly &s;o called, extends no farther than the Netherbow port, one of the city gates, which is grandly ornamented, and crowned with towers and &s;pires, that exhibit a magnificent ap|pearance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gate is now removed, &s;o that the &s;treet extends with|out interuption from the Ca&s;tle|hill to the abbey.</NOTE>. This is the extent of the city to the ea&s;tward; and from hence the town wall runs &s;outh and north in a &s;traight line. To the &s;outh|ward of the High Street, and parallel with it, runs another more narrow called Cowgate, &s;o denomi|nated from the cattle driven through it to the Gra&s;s-market, a broad open &s;treet at the we&s;tern extremity of the town, immediately under part of the ca&s;tle, which ri&s;es over it in a &s;teep precipice. To the &s;outh &s;ide of the Cowgate, the city &s;preads upwards on another gentle ri&s;ing, and is every where &s;urrounded by a wall, except on the north, where a &s;mall lake called the North Loch &s;erves in&s;tead of a fo&s;&s;e. The wall is furni&s;hed with &s;even gates, on the out&s;ide of which there are large &s;uburbs; &s;o that Edinburgh is an exten&s;ive city, about four miles in compa&s;s, and &s;urely, con|&s;idering its &s;cite, the mo&s;t populous in Europe; for the number of inhabitants amounts to fifty thou&s;and. The Gra&s;s-market is connected with the High Street by a long, narrow winding lane, called the We&s;t Bow, &s;o &s;teep that no carts or wag|gons can a&s;cend it; and the main &s;treet &s;ends off on each &s;ide narrow lanes called wynds, to the Cow|gate, and towards the North Loch, which is a &s;tinking pool, choaked up with all the filth which comes from this &s;ide of the metropolis. The High Street of Edinburgh is in all re&s;pects noble and magnificent, whether we con&s;ider the hou&s;es
<PB N="115" REF="1190">
on each &s;ide built of a&s;hler work, to the heighth of five and &s;ix &s;tories; or the &s;treet it&s;elf extending to a great width, finely paved with &s;mooth &s;quare &s;tones, ri&s;ing in the middle, and &s;loping on each &s;ide to a kennel of hewn free&s;tone, that conveys the rain water by which the cau&s;eway is occa&s;ion|ally wa&s;hed. At proper di&s;tances there are elegant conduits continually flowing with delicious water, &s;upplied from a re&s;ervoir on the Ca&s;tle-hill, which is filled by &s;ubterraneous leaden pipes brought from fountains at the di&s;tance of a mile to the &s;outhward of the city. The people of Edinburgh were &s;o hampered for want of room, by the na|ture of their &s;ituation, that they have been obliged to rai&s;e the hou&s;es to a &s;urprizing heighth: in one particular part where they are built on the &s;lope of a &s;teep hill from the Canongate to the Parlia|ment Clo&s;e, &s;ome of them ri&s;e twelve &s;tories from the foundation. Every floor or &s;tory of this city is a &s;eparate tenement, like tho&s;e of the inns of court in London, and the acce&s;s to them is by a common &s;tairca&s;e, which, if winding, is here called a turnpike. The great height of the hou&s;es is attended with numberle&s;s inconveniencies, and in ca&s;es of fire, renders the &s;ituation of the inhabitants very dreadful. The nature of the &s;tair-ca&s;es, common to many different families, and free to the feet and filth of all comers; the difficulty and expence of carrying a &s;ufficient quantity of water &s;o high upon the backs of porters; and the want of nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;es, contribute to fix the imputa|tion of na&s;tine&s;s on this otherwi&s;e magnificent city. The &s;tairs are dirty, dark, and dangerous: all the apartments, even of the be&s;t hou&s;es, though nicely rubbed, and elegantly furni&s;hed, yet retain &s;ome &s;mell of the convenience with which every lodging chamber mu&s;t be provided: but the mo&s;t di&s;a|greeable con&s;equence of this expedient is, the
<PB N="116" REF="1200">
nocturnal di&s;charge of tho&s;e nau&s;eous re&s;ervoirs. At ten of the clock every window is opened, and &s;uch a general deluge of the&s;e materials poured forth, that the whole air is impregnated with a mo&s;t un&s;ufferable odour, and the foot pa&s;&s;enger in the mo&s;t imminent danger of being over-whelmed with the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial part of the an|noyance.</P>
<P>In former times, the di&s;per&s;ers of the&s;e benefits taught, in all probability, by their polite allies, the French, were accu&s;tomed to give warning, by calling aloud <HI>gardez l'eau;</HI> but now all that ce|remony is laid a&s;ide, and woe will be upon the head of that man, who pre&s;umes to walk down the wynd at or about the hour of evacuation, with|out crying <HI>hold your hand</HI> ince&s;&s;antly, until he finds him&s;elf fairly hou&s;ed. This ordure is cleared away very early in the morning by &s;cavengers ap|pointed for that purpo&s;e, except on Sundays, when tho&s;e con&s;cientious clean&s;ers, out of mere piety, re&s;t from their labour, leaving the &s;treets in a very nau&s;eous condition. The truth is, however &s;trangers may be di&s;gu&s;ted with the&s;e filthy cu&s;|toms, the natives of Edinburgh are, by u&s;e, be|come in&s;en&s;ible to the annoyance; and when they perceive new comers giving marks of loathing and abhorrence, generally impute them to fal&s;e deli|cacy and affectation. Their neighbours of Eng|land, it mu&s;t be owned, have &s;ome rea&s;on to twit them in the teeth with the&s;e and other un&s;avoury practices.</P>
<P>The city of Edinburgh is adorned with &s;tately churches, &s;pires, and public edifices. The cathe|dral, dedicated to St. Giles, is a noble Gothic build|ing, now divided into four different churches or kirks, belonging to different pari&s;hes. The &s;pire is a very lofty tower, with a large open cupola of curious workman&s;hip, repre&s;enting an imperial
<PB N="117" REF="1210">
crown, and furni&s;hed with a &s;et of well toned bells, on which all manner of tunes are played every day except Sundays, between the hours of eleven and twelve, as an entertainment to the merchants and men of bu&s;ine&s;s, who are then a&s;&s;embled at the cro&s;s or market-place, to tran&s;act their affairs. In a chapel, on the &s;outh-we&s;t part of this church, the general a&s;&s;embly of the kirk hold their &s;e&s;&s;ions. Be&s;ides the cathedral, there are &s;ix other &s;tately churches in the city and &s;uburbs of Edinburgh; two elegant chapels, now converted into halls; and above twelve meeting-hou&s;es for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who adhere to the church of England. The mint of Edinburgh, now in di&s;u&s;e, forms a large court, provided with neat and convenient buildings for the over&s;eers and workmen. Here are other courts, &s;uch as James's Court, Milne Square, and the Par|liament Clo&s;e, which la&s;t is a noble quadrangle in the heart of the city, adorned with a fine eque&s;|trian &s;tatue of king Charles II. At one &s;ide of this &s;quare is the parliament hou&s;e, from whence it derives its name, a large &s;tructure of free&s;tone, built by Charles I. In the room where the par|liament formerly a&s;&s;embled, cau&s;es are now tried and determined by the lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion: in diffe|rent parts of the &s;ame building, the ju&s;ticiary or criminal court, the &s;heriff, and commi&s;&s;ary courts, are held: near the north end is the town-council, hou&s;e, or guild-hall: underneath is the po&s;t-office, the regi&s;ter office for all deeds and &s;ecurities; and adjoining to it, the library of the advocates or bar|ri&s;ters at law, a noble collection of books, manu|&s;cripts, medals, and coins, with &s;ome Roman and other antiquities. In the Parliament Clo&s;e there is likewi&s;e a &s;pacious apartment for the convention of the royal boroughs. The Tolbooth, or common pri&s;on for debtors and criminals, &s;tands near the we&s;t end of the great church, and here a guard
<PB N="118" REF="1220">
of regular troops was always kept while the &s;o|vereign re&s;ided in the palace of Holyrood-Hou&s;e: at pre&s;ent the peace of the city is pre&s;erved by a guard con&s;i&s;ting of two companies of &s;oldiers, uni|formly cloathed and maintained by the community, and commanded by a captain, under the direction of the magi&s;trates. Edinburgh is provided with two banks that i&s;&s;ue notes for twenty &s;hillings, cur|rent all over the kingdom. The market-cro&s;s, where all proclamations and public acts were read and publi&s;hed by &s;ound of trumpet, was a curious piece of architecture, but lately demoli&s;hed, in order to di&s;incumber the &s;treet: on the north &s;ide, oppo&s;ite to the Parliament Clo&s;e, the citizens have begun to build a new exchange for the merchants on a very elegant plan; and they have projected many other improvements, which we hope they will one day be able to execute. Among the ho&s;|pitals of Edinburgh, the mo&s;t remarkable is Her|riot's work, a magnificent &s;tructure, &s;ituated on an eminence at one &s;ide of the Gra&s;s-market, op|po&s;ite to the ca&s;tle: it was founded by George Herriot, gold&s;mith to king James VI. who left &s;even thou&s;and pounds &s;terling for the maintenance and education of poor children belonging to the merchants and trade&s;men of this city. It was built upon the plan of Inigo Jones, con&s;i&s;ting of an exact &s;quare, with piazzas all round; built of free&s;tone, embelli&s;hed with carved work, and a|dorned with towers and turrets. A &s;tatue of the founder, as big as the life, &s;tands in a niche over the in&s;ide of the gate. The entry is by an ea&s;y a&s;cent, through three &s;pacious courts; the apart|ments for the officers and &s;cholars are neat and commodious; the gardens are large, well di&s;|po&s;ed in delightful walks and grottos: in a word, this ho&s;pital has all the air of a royal palace. The magi&s;trates of the city are the perpetual guardians
<PB N="119" REF="1230">
of this noble charity, by which one hundred and thirty boys are cloathed, fed, educated, and put out as apprentices at a proper age. Edinburgh con|tains divers other ho&s;pitals, a workhou&s;e like that of Gla&s;gow, a noble infirmary, including cells for lunatics, built and &s;upported by voluntary con|tribution, and a bridewell, or hou&s;e of correction, for pro&s;titutes. In Fountain-clo&s;e, near the Nether|bow, is the college of Phy&s;icians, incorporated by patent under the great &s;eal of Charles II. giving them ample juri&s;diction, and certain privileges with|in the city. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the Cow-gate is the high &s;chool for Latin, &s;upplied with a ma&s;ter and four u&s;hers; and in the neighbourhood, the &s;urgeons hall, adorned with &s;ome good portraits and preparations in anatomy. On the north &s;ide of the town is a phy&s;ic garden, exhibiting above three thou&s;and plants, regularly cla&s;&s;ed for the u&s;e of the &s;tudents in botany. On a ri&s;ing ground, to the &s;outhward of the Cow-gate, &s;tands the college or univer&s;ity, founded by king James VI. in com|pliance with a petition from the city. The dig|nity of chancellor or vice-chancellor is ve&s;ted in the provo&s;t, the other magi&s;trates, and town council for the time being: the in&s;titution is well &s;upported by very able profe&s;&s;ors in divinity, philo&s;ophy, philology, and e&s;pecially in medicine, which is here taught in all its branches by men eminent for their learning and ability. It is accordingly crowded with &s;tudents from all parts of the i&s;land, and may be ju&s;tly deemed the be&s;t medical &s;emi|nary in Europe. The buildings of the college are tolerably neat and commodious. The profe&s;&s;ors are accommodated with good hou&s;es and gardens: the &s;cholars meet in their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es at &s;tated hours; but they do not lodge in the college; nor are they di&s;tingui&s;hed by wearing gowns, like tho&s;e of the other Scotch univer&s;ities. This college
<PB N="120" REF="1240">
is endowed with all the privileges granted to any other univer&s;ity: it confers the degrees of ma&s;ter of arts and doctor; and is provided with a very good library, under which there is a royal printing hou&s;e. Towards the &s;outh end there is a noble mu&s;aeum collected by Sir Andrew Balfour, M. D. who was tutor to the famous earl of Roche&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of the town there is a piece of ground called the Meadow, agreeably laid out in walks for the recreation of the citizens: from the out&s;ide of the Nether-bow Port, a narrow &s;treet called Leith Wynd, &s;tretches along the city wall &s;outherly; and from the end of this, a noble walk is continued to Leith, which is the &s;ea-port of Edin|burgh. At the extremity of the &s;uburbs called the Canon-gate, &s;tands upon the ground formerly occupied by an abbey the royal palace of Holy|rood-hou&s;e, begun by James V. and fini&s;hed by Charles II. according to a plan of Sir William Bruce, that king's architect for Scotland. It con|&s;i&s;ts of an outward court, having a maje&s;tic en|trance, adorned with &s;tone pillars, and a balu&s;traded cupola above, in form of a crown; within there is a magnificent quadrangle finely paved, with an arcade all around. The rooms of &s;tate are large, lofty, elegantly furni&s;hed, and every way &s;uitable to a royal palace. There are be&s;ides, noble apart|ments for the great officers of &s;tate, particularly for the duke of Hamilton, hereditary keeper of the palace. In one gallery we &s;ee the portraits of the Scotti&s;h kings from the fir&s;t Fergus, who is &s;aid to have reigned three hundred and twenty years before Chri&s;t, to William III. prince of Orange: but they are, for the mo&s;t part, paultry pieces, drawn from the imagination of the painter; and indeed one may perceive that the majority have been paint|ed by one hand. Behind the palace &s;tands the cha|pel, which is no other than the conventual church
<PB N="121" REF="1250">
that belonged to the old abbey, with a very lofty roof, and two rows of &s;tone galleries, &s;upported by very curious pillars. James VI. and his &s;on Charles were crowned in the chapel. Here it was that king James VII. created a magnificent throne for the &s;overeign, and twelve &s;talls for the knights companions of the order of the thi&s;tle, curiou&s;ly carved and adorned by the be&s;t workmen in Europe; the floor was beautifully paved with marble, and a fine organ was &s;et up: but all the&s;e ornaments were de&s;troyed by the blind fanatici&s;m of the po|pulace at the revolution, &s;ince which period the chapel has been falling gradually to decay. The people, in their Gothic rage, not only tore up the pavement, but even penetrated into a vault built up, in which were found the bodies of king James V. his fir&s;t queen Magdalene of Valois, and lord Darnley, hu&s;band of queen Mary. The&s;e were embalmed, and are &s;till &s;hewn to &s;trangers. The royal garden, at the northern end of the outward court, has been long ago converted into a botanical nur&s;ery, where the different plants are arranged ac|cording to their tribes; and on the &s;outhern &s;ide, there is a large garden elegantly di&s;po&s;ed in walks, parterres, and inclo&s;ures, which, in all likelihood, likewi&s;e belonged to the palace.</P>
<P>The adjoining park, about four miles in cir|cuit, is now a bare piece of ground, without tree or &s;hrub, bounded on one &s;ide by a &s;teep hill, known by the name of Arthur's Seat; and about half way up this hill are the ruins of a chapel, de|dicated to St. Anthony.</P>
<P>The city of Edinburgh is governed by a lord provo&s;t, four bailiffs, a dean of guild, and a trea|&s;urer, annually cho&s;en from the common council. Every company or incorporated trade choo&s;es its own deacon, and here are fourteen, namely, &s;ur|geons, gold&s;miths, &s;kinners, furriers, hammer-men,
<PB N="122" REF="1260">
wrights or carpenters, ma&s;ons, taylors, bakers, butchers, cordwainers, weavers, fullers, and bonnet|makers. The train bands con&s;i&s;t of &s;ixteen com|panies, be&s;ides the town guard, which is a &s;tanding militia. When any public work begins to decay, or a &s;um of money is required to defray any ex|traordinary expence for the benefit of the com|munity in the cities and boroughs of this kingdom, they by their repre&s;entatives apply to the Briti&s;h parliament for a tax of two pennies Scots to be laid for a certain period, upon every Scots pint of ale &s;old within the precincts of the petitioning bo|rough. This ea&s;y impo&s;ition, which is &s;carce felt by the inhabitants, enables them to di&s;charge old debts, repair decayed fabricks, maintain and im|prove harbours, and execute many works of public utility. By this temporary tax e&s;tabli&s;hed at Edin|burgh, and the di&s;continuance of what was called the petty port cu&s;toms, the water was brought in leaden pipes to the re&s;ervoir we have already men|tioned, the conduits were rebuilt, the harbour of Leith was enlarged, the channel deepened, and the quay lengthened &s;everal hundred feet; two new churches were rai&s;ed, and the roads leading to the city &s;ecured with an excellent pavement; a work|hou&s;e was built for the poor, and endowed with three hundred pounds &s;terling per annum; the city walls were repaired, and &s;tipends &s;ettled on a profe&s;&s;or of law and two mini&s;ters appointed for the new churches. The markets of Edinburgh are well &s;upplied with all kinds of butcher's meat, fi&s;h, poultry, game, greens, and fruit, at rea&s;onable rates, and every &s;pecies is &s;old in its own di&s;tinct markets. The bread is remarkably fine; the but|ter and chee&s;e inferior to that which is made in England. Here is plenty of &s;mall claret, and Portugue&s;e wines neat as imported. There is good entertainment in the taverns, though the
<PB N="123" REF="1270">
cooks are not over cleanly, and abundance of fine table linen. Private lodgings are here rea&s;onable and commodious; but the inns of Edinburgh are dirty and uncomfortable. The people of this me|tropolis are &s;en&s;ible, &s;prightly, and much more polite to &s;trangers than to each other when they happen to differ in point of religion or politicks: in that ca&s;e, they are rancorous and implacable. When we mention the people, however, we ought to make a di&s;tinction between the natives and the &s;ojourners. The fir&s;t are, like the burghers of every opulent city, a better kind of vulgar, con&s;i&s;ting of merchants and trade&s;men, the majority of whom are religioni&s;ts of the pre&s;byterian leaven, &s;our and cen&s;orious: the others are a medley of all ingre|dients, compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who come hither for education, for plea&s;ure, and to give attendance on the courts of ju&s;tice. Heretofore the nobility crowded to Edinburgh during the winter, from all parts of the kingdom. The magnificent hou&s;es of many noblemen are &s;till remaining in the Canon|gate; but they are almo&s;t quite abandoned by their owners, who now &s;pend their winters in London, &s;olliciting the court for favours, which rob them of their independence. Neverthele&s;s, a great number of the Scotti&s;h gentry re&s;ide with their families in Edinburgh during the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on of the year, when they rival their &s;outhern neigh|bours in gaiety of dre&s;s, and variety of diver&s;ions. Here are a&s;&s;emblies for dancing and card-playing, plays every night, and concerts once a fortnight. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the ladies make a very &s;plendid appearance, both in dre&s;s and in per&s;onal beauty: the &s;treets are crowded with their equipages; and Edinburgh &s;till maintains the external marks of a rich metropolis. The inhabitants in a great mea|&s;ure &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the money expended by the&s;e vi|&s;itants, and by the commodities of all kinds which
<PB N="124" REF="1280">
they collect in their &s;hops and warehou&s;es, and di&s;tribute through all parts of the kingdom. Here are likewi&s;e merchants and manufacturers, who embark in foreign commerce, and are concerned in the trading &s;hips that &s;ail from Leith to all parts of Europe.</P>
<P>Leith, which may be &s;tiled the warehou&s;e as well as the port of Edinburgh, is a flouri&s;hing town, &s;tanding on the &s;ide of the Frith, at the di&s;tance of a long mile from the metropolis, and &s;ubject to its juri&s;diction, though governed by its own bailiff. It derives its name from a &s;mall river called the water of Leith, which divides the town into two parts; but the&s;e are connected again by an hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge. The hou&s;es are very high, and being of a&s;hler work, make an hand&s;ome appearance; and all along the quay there are com|modious warehou&s;es and cellars, in which peri&s;h|able commodities are depo&s;ited. The harbour is formed by a long pier or quay of hewn &s;tone, carried out far into the &s;ea, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and on the we&s;t, by &s;trong ranges of piles, breakwaters, or counterpiers, which are kept in repair at a con|&s;iderable expence. By this contrivance the har|bour is kept free, open, and acce&s;&s;ible, although the &s;hore be flat, and the &s;well con&s;iderable. Above one hundred &s;hips are &s;ometimes &s;een at once in the harbour of Leith. The town it&s;elf is populous; the inhabitants are indu&s;trious: here is the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, where goods for exportation and importa|tion are entered: but the commi&s;&s;ioners keep their office at Edinburgh, where the merchants general|ly re&s;ide. There is a gla&s;s-hou&s;e, a &s;ugar-hou&s;e, a &s;aw-mill, and divers other works at Leith; and, in a word, the whole place wears the a&s;pect of bu|&s;ine&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s. Hither come the large ferry|boats with pa&s;&s;engers from Kinghorn, on the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide of the Frith, which is here &s;even miles
<PB N="125" REF="1290">
over; and hither re&s;ort the citizens of Edinburgh on parties of plea&s;ure, chiefly with a view to re|gale them&s;elves with the &s;ea air and fre&s;h oy&s;ters, which are caught near this place in great plenty. At North Leith, that &s;tands on the other &s;ide of the harbour, there are docks, in which large &s;hips have been built and repaired; and here we &s;ee the ruins of a citadel, built by Oliver Cromwell, when he was ma&s;ter of this country. Between Leith and Kinghorn, about the middle of the Frith, lies the &s;mall i&s;land Inch Keith, frequented by water fowl. We&s;hall &s;ay nothing further of this &s;ea-port of Edinburgh, but that here are hor&s;e-races every year for the king's plate; and on the&s;e occa&s;ions Edinburgh is crowded with the be&s;t company in Scotland. About four miles to the ea&s;tward of Leith, and on the &s;ame coa&s;t, we enter Mu&s;&s;elburgh, an antient burgh of regality, and market-town, &s;ituated near the mouth of the river E&s;k, with a tolerable harbour. This place, which is but thinly inhabited, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by a manufacture of coar&s;e woollen &s;tuffs, and by its corn market. A little to the we&s;tward, and almo&s;t contiguous, is the &s;mall town of Fi&s;her-row, inhabited by fi&s;hermen, who, together with &s;hell fi&s;h in abundance, catch great numbers of cod, haddock, and whiting. There are be&s;ides, the villages of Newbiggin and Good&s;pead, all &s;o clo&s;e together, that all the four &s;eem to be one continued town; the two la&s;t belonging to the pari&s;h of In|vere&s;k, an agreeable village, &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground that fronts the Frith, and commands a no|ble pro&s;pect on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Fife. There are many elegant hou&s;es at Invere&s;k, the air of which is e&s;teemed &s;o healthy, that this village is called the Montpelier of Scotland. At one end of Mu&s;&s;elburgh &s;tands Pinkey, a noble &s;eat near the &s;ea, belonging to the marquis of Tweedale. This
<PB N="126" REF="1300">
palace, which formerly belonged to Seton, earl of Dumfermline, &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing ground, front|ing the Frith, of which it commands a noble pro&s;|pect, and is one of the mo&s;t magnificent &s;eats in Great Britain; whether we con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of the edifice, the grandeur of the apartments, the richne&s;s of the furniture; the number and excel|lence of the paintings; the beauty of the gardens, the plantation, and extent of the park, or the de|lightful &s;ituation. Hard by is the field of battle, where the Scots were defeated by the duke of Somer&s;et, regent of England, in the minority of his nephew, the &s;ixth Edward. Two miles further ea&s;tward on this coa&s;t, is Pre&s;ton town, and Pre&s;ton pans, where a great quantity of &s;alt is made by boiling the &s;ea water. This village, incon&s;iderable in it&s;elf, was rendered famous in the year 1745, by the defeat of the king's troops under Sir John Cope, who was here routed by the Highlanders, who declared for the young Pretender. At the di&s;tance of five miles ea&s;t of Edinburgh, the town of Dalkeith is &s;ituated at the conflux of the two rivers E&s;k, a large, populous, and flouri&s;hing vil|lage, that gives the title of earl to the family of Scot, duke of Buccleugh, and is the &s;eat of a &s;mall pre&s;bytery: but the place is more remarkable for the magnificent palace here built by the late dutche&s;s, on the very &s;cite of the old ca&s;tle. It &s;tands upon an eminence, on the bank of the river North E&s;k; is built of free&s;tone, after the model of the palace at Loo, belonging to the prince of Orange, in Guelderland. The front is adorned with columns of the Corinthian order: the grand &s;tair-cai&s;e is &s;up|ported by pillars of marble. The apartments are &s;pacious and princely, magnificently furni&s;hed, and adorned with fine paintings. The offices are &s;uit|able to the dignity of the palace, which overlooks a large park, well planted with trees, and beauti|fied
<PB N="127" REF="1310">
with a canal and water-works. In a word, the palace of Dalkeith is the large&s;t and noble&s;t mo|dern hou&s;e in all Scotland. In this neighbourhood we &s;ee the hou&s;e of Newbottle, a fine old &s;eat, be|longing to the marquis of Lothian, enriched with a noble collection of pictures and &s;tatues, and &s;ur|rounded by a very agreeable plantation, through which many plea&s;ant walks and vi&s;tas are opened. About four miles from Edinburgh is Ro&s;lin, noted for a &s;tately Gothic chapel, counted one of the mo&s;t curious pieces of workman&s;hip in Europe, founded in the year 1440, by William St. Clair, prince of Orkney, and duke of Holdenburg. It was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a provo&s;t and &s;even canons regular, whom the lands of Ro&s;lin endowed with con&s;idera|ble revenues. Ro&s;lin is likewi&s;e famous for a vic|tory which the Scots, under Cummin and Fra&s;er, obtained in this place, about the year 1303, over Seagrave, the Engli&s;h general. The Scotti&s;h hi&s;|torians affirm, that the Engli&s;h army being divided into three bodies of ten thou&s;and each, the Scots, not exceeding eight thou&s;and, defeated each &s;epa|rate divi&s;ion in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive encounters: but the Engli&s;h writers repre&s;ent this affair as an incon&s;i|derable check, occa&s;ioned by an ambu&s;cade, in which the van guard of their army fell and was defeated. Mid-Lothian, is adorned with a great number of elegant hou&s;es, belonging to the gentry, which we cannot pretend to particularize; among others, the hou&s;es of the earls of Morton and Lau|derdale, about &s;ix miles to the we&s;tward of Edin|burgh, two elegant edifices, &s;urrounded with parks agreeably planted with a variety of trees; and at a little di&s;tance the hou&s;e of New Linton, a de|lightful &s;eat, where the late earl of Stair re&s;ided during his honourable rece&s;s from courts and cor|ruption: nor is it deficient in Roman antiquities. At Cramond, upon the Frith, four miles to the
<PB N="128" REF="1320">
we&s;tward of Edinburgh, we &s;ee the remains of a great Roman &s;tation, in the e&s;tate of Sir John Ingli&s;h. Here &s;everal Roman altars have been found, and &s;tones having in&s;criptions dug up, to|gether with a great quantity of Roman coins, bra&s;s, &s;ilver, and gold. Great part of the&s;e, and many other curious pieces of antiquity, were col|lected by the late Sir John Clark, of Penny-cuik, one of the barons of the exchequer, a gentleman of con&s;iderable fortune, eminent for his ta&s;te and learning, who&s;e country hou&s;e at Mavis Bank, in this county, is one of the mo&s;t agreeable villas in all Scotland.</P>

<HEAD>The Shire of HADDINGTON, or EAST-LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire or con&s;tabulary of Haddington, wa&s;hed on the north and ea&s;t by the Frith of Forth; hem|med in on the &s;outh by the hills of Lammermuir; and on the we&s;t adjoining to the &s;hire of Edinburgh; &s;tretches about twenty miles in length, and twelve in breadth; and is one of the mo&s;t fruitful coun|ties in Scotland; producing great quantities of ex|cellent wheat and all &s;orts of grain, well watered with &s;treams, plentifully &s;upplied with fi&s;h, fowl, fuel, and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life; abounding with towns, villages, and farms, and inter&s;per&s;ed with a great number of agreeable hou&s;es belonging to per|&s;ons of rank and fortune. With re&s;pect to cul|tivation, populou&s;ne&s;s, and fertility, this &s;hire may vie with any tract of land in the i&s;land of Great-Britain. Over and above the farming, which turns out to great account, the people towards the &s;ea|coa&s;t employ them&s;elves in the fi&s;hery, &s;alt making, and in foreign trade; and &s;ome of the more inland inhabitants engage in the linen and woollen manu|factures. Lime&s;tone and coal are found in mo&s;t parts of the country; and great numbers of &s;heep

are fed on the hills of Lammermuir. The county town, Hadenn or Haddington, which gives the title of earl to a branch of the Hamilton family, is a royal burrough, &s;ituated on the &s;mall river Tine, over which there is a hand&s;ome bridge of three arches. The town is large and well built, has a good corn market, and is the &s;eat of a large pre&s;bytery. Here are the remains of an old nun|nery, founded by Henry, &s;on to St. David, king of Scotland. At pre&s;ent the town of Haddington bears marks of decay. Many hou&s;es are ruinous, and there is little appearance of bu&s;ine&s;s in the place, though a company of adventurers have here e&s;tabli&s;hed a large manufacture of broad cloth, little inferior to the be&s;t of England. In this neighbourhood there are many fine &s;eats, among which is Ye&s;ter Hou&s;e, belonging to the marquis of Tweedale; and not far di&s;tant is Tinningham, the agreeable &s;eat of the earl of Haddington.</P>
<P>There are many other fine &s;eats in this county, &s;uch as Seton Hou&s;e, formerly belonging to the earl of Wintoun, who was forfeited in the rebel|lion of 1715, a noble palace now in ruins; the hou&s;es of lord Elibank, lord Bellhaven, lord Stor|mount, Fletcher of Saltoun, Ni&s;bet of Dirleton, Cockburn of Orm&s;toun, and many more, which the nature of our plan will not allow us to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of four miles, upon the &s;ea coa&s;t, is &s;ituated North Berwick, a &s;mall royal burrough, which by means of its harbour, enjoys &s;ome &s;hare of commerce. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore, ri&s;es the i&s;land or rock called the Ba&s;s, about a mile in circumference, &s;teep and in|acce&s;&s;ible on all &s;ides except to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and even there, it is with great difficulty that a &s;ingle man can climb up with the help of a rope or lad|der. It is &s;upplied with water by a &s;pring at the top, and, belonging to the crown, was formerly
<PB N="130" REF="1340">
kept as a garri&s;on. A party of king James's ad|herents &s;urprized it at the Revolution, and it was the la&s;t place in the three kingdoms that &s;urrendered to the new government, which ordered the forti|fications to be &s;lighted. In the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on this remarkable rock, which ri&s;es to a great height above the &s;urface of the water, in form of a cone, is quite covered with &s;ea fowl, which come hither to breed. The chief of tho&s;e are the &s;olan gee&s;e, which arrive in June, and retire in September. The people in this neighbourhood catch the young in great numbers: they &s;ell the meat for dainties, and turn the feathers to good account. The Ba&s;s contains a &s;mall warren for rabbits, and affords pa&s;ture for a few &s;heep. It is upon the whole a great curio&s;ity; and the force of the tides has worn a hole almo&s;t quite through the rock. Hard by North Berwick, is the &s;eat of Sir Hugh Dal|rymple.</P>
<P>Dunbar is an antient royal burrough, &s;ituated near the mouth of the Frith, the &s;eat of a pre&s;by|tery, famous for the defeat of the Scotti&s;h army by Oliver Cromwell, as well as for its antient ca&s;tle, which &s;u&s;tained many a &s;iege from the Engli&s;h, and was at la&s;t demoli&s;hed in the minority of king James VI. Dunbar is a neat little town, with a good market, and a &s;ecure harbour, which the in|habitants have built with great labour and expence. A great quantity of herrings is caught annually at this place, though they are not &s;o good as tho&s;e caught on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland. Here are &s;ome eminent merchants, who fit out &s;hips, and carry on a con&s;iderable &s;hare of commerce, which when properly extended, will render this place a flouri&s;hing &s;ea-port.</P>

<HEAD>BERWICKSHIRE, or the MERS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, deriving its name from the town of Berwick, which was the head of the &s;hire before it fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, and obtained the appellation of Mers or March, becau&s;e it was one of the borders towards England, is wa&s;hed on the &s;outh and ea&s;t by the river Tweed and the German Ocean, bounded on the we&s;t by Tweedale, and on the north by Lothian. It extends four and twenty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and the breadth amounts to &s;ixteen. The face of the country is rough and irregular, exhibiting hills, moors, and mo&s;&s;es, with intermediate vallies, which are plea|&s;ant and fruitful. It is watered by many &s;treams, and particularly by the famous Tweed, which ri|&s;ing from the &s;ame hills that give birth to the Clyde and Annan, runs with a rapid cour&s;e through Tweedale Fore&s;t, and Teviotdale, and after a cour&s;e of fifty miles, di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the German ocean. Notwith&s;tanding the length of its cour&s;e, it is not navigable above Berwick, where there is a noble bridge over it, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen arches: there was another at Melro&s;s, where nothing but the piers now remain. A third, of five arches, is maintained at Peebles; and a fourth has lately been built at Kel&s;o. The &s;hire of Berwick is ge|nerally di&s;tingui&s;hed into the three divi&s;ions of Mers, Lammermuir, and Lauderdale. The Mers is low, plea&s;ant, and tolerably fruitful in corn. Lammermuir is a hilly country, abounding with game, and yielding good pa&s;ture for &s;heep and black cattle. Lauderdale is a tract of land lying on each &s;ide of the river Lauder, agreeably varied with hill, dale, and fore&s;t, producing good &s;tore of corn and pa&s;turage, and giving the title of earl to the family of Maitland: but the mo&s;t fruitful and populous parts of Berwick&s;hire, are tho&s;e that
<PB N="132" REF="1360">
lie along the Tweed, and on both &s;ides of the le&s;&s;er rivers White Water, Black Water, and Eye. The &s;eats of noblemen and gentlemen abound in this county. The regality of Thul&s;tan belonged to the earl of Lauderdale: the fore&s;t of Dye is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duke of Douglas: the earl of Home re&s;ides at the Herfell, near Cold&s;tream: the earl of Marchmont has a fine &s;eat near Duns: and this county of Mers, or March, gives the title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Douglas, immediately de&s;cended from the hou&s;e of Queen&s;|berry. Berwick was the chief town of this county, until it fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, and was annexed to their monarchy in the reign of king Edward IV. At pre&s;ent the principal town is Duns, a pretty large populous burgh of barony, &s;tanding on a ri&s;ing ground in the center of the &s;hire, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, and formerly of the courts of ju&s;tice, removed hither when the Engli&s;h reduced Berwick. It has a fair ca&s;tle, an excellent market for corn and cattle, and is famous as the birth|place of the famous Duns Scotus.</P>
<P>Aymouth, Eymouth, or Haymouth, is a good fi&s;hing town, the only &s;ea-port of the &s;hire, at the mouth of the river Eye, from whence it derives the name: it has a weekly market, and &s;ome trade, and is remarkable for having given the fir&s;t title of nobility to the great John, duke of Marlborough, who was by Charles II. created baron of Eymouth, when he attended the duke of York in Scotland.</P>
<P>Cold&s;tream is a &s;mall market-town, &s;ituated on the Tweed, in the neighbourhood of a mona&s;tery, which has been long demoli&s;hed. It was here that general Monk rai&s;ed the two battalions, which are now known by the name of the Cold&s;tream regiment of foot guards. Greenlaw, at the di&s;tance of four miles from Duns, is a burgh of regality, be|longing to the earl of Marchmont, who re&s;ides in this
<PB N="133" REF="1370">
part of the country. Eyton, or Acton, is a plea&s;ant village belonging to the earl of Home, built upon the river Eye, over which there is a bridge of &s;tone. Coldingham, &s;tanding near the coa&s;t, is now an incon&s;iderable place, though famous for an antient abbey, built in the beginning of the twelfth cen|tury, by Edgar, king of Scotland. This abbey was renowned in con&s;equence of the cha&s;tity of its nuns, who, at the Dani&s;h inva&s;ion, by the advice and example of their abbe&s;s, defaced them&s;elves by cutting off their lips and no&s;es, that their beauty might not &s;ubject them to brutal violation. The good lady, who&s;e name was Ebba, has been cano|nized for this act of virtuous &s;elf-denial; and a neighbouring promontory is called St. Ebb's head, in memorial of this tran&s;action. Chur&s;ide is a paultry town, four miles from Eyton, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery. Er&s;ilton, &s;ituated on the river Lauder, is likewi&s;e the &s;eat of a &s;mall pre&s;bytery, famous for the birth of Thomas Lermont, commonly called Thomas the Rhymer, who&s;e prophecies are as much in reque&s;t among the Scots, as tho&s;e of Merlin or Nixon are in e&s;teem with the commonalty in Eng|land. He was born in the thirteenth century, and is &s;aid to have progno&s;ticated the union of the two kingdoms. Lauder is an antient royal burrough, &s;ituated on the river from whence it takes the name, the capital of Lauderdale, and &s;eat of the commi&s;&s;aries. On the bridge of Lauder, &s;ome of the Scotti&s;h nobles, headed by the earl of Angus, &s;eized two or three minions of king James III. who were very unpopular, and hanged them without ce|remony. The earl of Lauderdale has an agreable &s;eat on the banks of this river. At the town of Pre&s;ton there is a large hou&s;e belonging to the duke of Douglas. The village of Gordon in this county gave the title of baron and &s;urname to the head of that numerous and powerful clan di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="134" REF="1380">
by this appellation. About fourteen miles to the we&s;tward of Berwick, &s;tands Cockburn's path, or Copper's path, a &s;mall fi&s;hing town on the coa&s;t, lying between two &s;trong pa&s;&s;es, which by a few re&s;olute men might be defended again&s;t a large army.</P>

<HEAD>AIRESHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Aire is bounded on the north by Renfrew; on the &s;outh by Galloway; on the ea&s;t and we&s;t by Clyd&s;dale and the Frith of Clyde. It extends &s;ixty-four miles in length from north to &s;outh; thirty-&s;ix miles in breadth, and is divided into the three great bailliages of Kyle, Carrick, and Cunningham. The country is generally level, plea&s;ant, and fertile, well watered with &s;treams and rivers, plentifully &s;upplied with fi&s;h; yielding abundance of free&s;tone, lime&s;tone, coal, and peat for fuel; producing large harve&s;ts of corn, a great number of &s;heep, hor&s;es, and black cattle; &s;haded and adorned with woods and plantations, belong|ing to the &s;eats of noblemen and gentlemen, of which there is a great number in this county. The people are rigid pre&s;byterians, numerous, indu&s;tri|ous, and wealthy, exerci&s;ing them&s;elves in the va|rious employments of farming, fi&s;hing, wool|combing, and the linen manufacture.</P>
<P>Carrick, or Carrict, the &s;outhern divi&s;ion, bor|dering on Galloway, &s;tretches thirty-two miles in length, is a hilly country, fit for pa&s;ture, of which the earls of Ca&s;&s;ils were hereditary bailiffs. The chief rivers of this tract are the Stencher and Gir|ven, both abounding with &s;almon: here are al&s;o divers lakes and fore&s;ts; and the people on the coa&s;t are employed in the herring fi&s;hery, though they have no harbour of any con&s;equence. The only towns of this di&s;trict, are Bargeny and May|bole, two incon&s;iderable villages; yet the fir&s;t gives
<PB N="135" REF="1390">
the title of baron to a branch of the Hamilton fa|mily. The divi&s;ion of Kyle, properly called the &s;hire of Aire, is &s;eparated from Carrick by the river Dun, over which there is a bridge of one arch, wider than that of the Rialto of Venice, and from Cunningham by the river Irwin. It is a rich and populous country, extending thirty-four miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and twenty-&s;ix from north to &s;outh, divided into two &s;tewartries by the river Aire, which, after a winding cour&s;e from ea&s;t to we&s;t, falls into the &s;ea below the town that borrows its name. The Scotti&s;h writers derive the name of Koyle from a Briti&s;h king called Koilus, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been defeated and &s;lain in this country by Fergus, king of Scotland. This tradition &s;eems to be in &s;ome &s;ort confirmed by divers circum&s;tances. The &s;pot on which the battle is &s;aid to have been fought, re|tains the name of Coil-field: a neighbouring church is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Coil-toun|kirk: an adjacent river is called Coil-water; and a lake near which the Scots incamped, is denomi|nated Loch-fergus. In Coil-field, the natives dug up a kind of trumpet re&s;embling the lituus or clarion of the Romans. The county town is Aire, an antient royal burrough commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for trade, at the mouth of the river, which abounds with &s;almon. The place is compo&s;ed of the old and new towns joined together by a bridge of four arches; is large, open, and pretty well inhabited; has a good harbour, and &s;ome &s;hare of commerce; but exhibits evident &s;ymptoms of decay: it is never|thele&s;s counted the chief market town in this part of Scotland; is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, adorned with a &s;tately church, and other hand&s;ome public edifices. At a little di&s;tance from the town there is a lazar-hou&s;e near the &s;hore, founded for the maintenance of lepers, by king Robert de Brus, who was him&s;elf afflicted with this di&s;temper. Aire
<PB N="136" REF="1400">
is remarkable for the cruel ma&s;&s;acre of many no|blemen and gentlemen in Scotland, whom the Engli&s;h governor for Edward I. had a&s;&s;embled on pretence of holding a court of ju&s;tice. They were &s;eized one by one as they entered the place called the king's barn, and hanged without trial or delay. This barbarous execution being fini&s;hed, the Engli&s;h officers gave a loo&s;e to mirth and intemperance: but in the night they were &s;urprized by a party of Scots under the celebrated William Wallace, a na|tive of this country, who having &s;urrounded the barns, &s;et fire to them, and all the Engli&s;h were burned to a&s;hes. In this divi&s;ion &s;tands Ochiltree ca&s;tle, a &s;eat of the Stuarts, de&s;cended from the blood-royal: the hou&s;e of Stair, giving the title of earl to the family of Dalrymple: the me&s;&s;uage Dundonald, giving an earl's title to the family of Cochran; and the &s;eat of the earl of Crawfurd, vi&s;count of Garnock; and the hou&s;e of the earl of Gla&s;gow. The third divi&s;ion, Cunningham, a Dani&s;h word, &s;ignifying the king's re&s;idence, giving a &s;urname to the antient and noble family of Glen|cairn, is an agreeable level country, bordering on the &s;outh with Kyle; wa&s;hed on the north and we&s;t by the Fryth of Clyde, and bounded on the ea&s;t by Renfrew and part of Clyd&s;dale. It extends near thirty miles from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, but not above twelve in breadth; and is parted from Kyle by the water of Irwine. The chief town is a bur|rough of this name, &s;tanding at the mouth of the river, pretty large and populous, having an in|different harbour for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, by means of which the inhabitants drive a con&s;iderable coal trade with Dublin. There is an hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge over the river; and here we &s;ee the remains of a citadel built by Oliver Cromwell. Irwine gives the title of vi&s;count to the Engli&s;h family of In|gram. In the neighbourhood of this town &s;tands
<PB N="137" REF="1410">
Eglinton, the &s;eat of the antient and noble family of Montgomery, which hence derives the title of earl. Of this family was Gabriel de Lorges, count de Montgomery, captain of the Scotch gardes du corps in France, who killed king Henry II. of that kingdom, in a tournament, with a &s;plinter of his &s;pear, which entered his maje&s;ty's eye, and penetra|ted into the brain. Poununy ca&s;tle, in this &s;hire, was built with the ran&s;om-money payed by Henry Piercy, &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur, whom Sir James Mont|gomery took with his own hands in the battle of Otterburn. At Larges, on the &s;ea coa&s;t, in the &s;hire of Air, Alexander III. king of Scotland, obtained a complete victory over Acho, king of Norway, who invaded this part of the country, with an army of twenty thou&s;and men. In this battle an Iri&s;h gentleman di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by &s;uch extraordinary acts of valour, that king Alex|ander be&s;towed upon him the lands of Kentail, where he &s;ettled; and from him is de&s;cended the numerous and valiant clan of the Mackenzies. On the north-ea&s;t border of the &s;hire, about &s;even miles from Irwine, &s;tands the populous and flou|ri&s;hing town of Kilmarnock, famous for its manu|facture of broad cloth and hardware, which gave the title of earl to the noble family of Boyd re|&s;iding in this neighbourhood: this title was for|feited by the late earl, who, by engaging in the re|bellion of 1745, was deprived of his honours, and lo&s;t his life on the &s;caffold. His &s;on, however, who &s;erved in the king's army, has &s;ince that period &s;ucceeded to the earldom of Errol, a title much more antient and honourable. Near the &s;ource of the river Irwine, at the di&s;tance of nine miles from Kilmarnock, &s;tands the hou&s;e of Lon|don, an elegant &s;eat belonging to the earl of that name, de&s;cended from the family of Argyle, who&s;e &s;urname he retains.</P>

<HEAD>The Shire of PEEBLES, or TWEEDALE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hire of Peebles, called Tweedale, from the river Tweed, that runs through the whole length of the county, &s;tretches about five and twenty miles in length, and at &s;ome places eighteen in breadth; bounded on the ea&s;t by Ettrick Fore&s;t; on the &s;outh by Annandale; on the we&s;t by Clyde&s;dale; and on the north by Mid Lothian. Tweedale is a hilly country, well watered with the Tweed, the Yarrow, and a great number of &s;maller &s;treams that fertilize the valleys, which produce good harve&s;ts of oats and barley, with &s;ome pro|portion of wheat. All the rivers of any con&s;e|quence abound with trout and &s;almon. The lake called We&s;t-Water-Loch, &s;warms with a prodigious number of eels. In the month of Augu&s;t, when the we&s;t wind blows, they tumble into the river Yarrow in &s;uch &s;hoals, that the people who wade in to catch them run the ri&s;que of being over|turned. There is another lake on the borders of Annandale, called Lochgennen, which forms a ca|taract over a precipice two hundred and fifty paces high: here the water falls with &s;uch a momentum as to kill the fi&s;h underneath. About the middle of this county is the hill or mountain of Braidalb, from the top of which the &s;ea may be &s;een on each &s;ide of the i&s;land. Tweedale abounds with lime|&s;tone and free&s;tone. The hills are generally as green as the downs in Su&s;&s;ex, and feed innume|rable flocks of &s;heep, that yield great quantities of excellent wool. The country is well &s;haded with woods and plantations, abounds with all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, and is adorned with many fine &s;eats and populous villages. The earls of March were hereditary &s;heriffs of Tweedale, which be|&s;tows the title of marquis on a branch of the an|tient
<PB N="139" REF="1430">
hou&s;e of Hay, earls of Errol and hereditary high con&s;tables of Scotland. The family of Tweedale is, by the female &s;ide, de&s;cended from the famous Simon de Fra&s;er, proprietor of great part of this country, who had a great &s;hare in ob|taining the triple victory at Ro&s;lin. The chief, and indeed the only town of con&s;equence in Tweedale, is Peebles, a &s;mall incon&s;iderable royal burrough and &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, plea&s;antly &s;i|tuated on the banks of the Tweed, over which there is at this place a &s;tately &s;tone bridge of five arches. In the neighbourhood of Peebles, near the village of Romana, on the river Lene, we &s;ee the ve&s;tiges of two Roman ca&s;tella, or &s;tationary forts, like that we have de&s;cribed at Ardoch; and a great many terraces on the neighbouring hills, which perhaps have &s;erved as itinerary encamp|ments. In the &s;hire of Tweedale there are many antient and honourable families of the gentry. Among the&s;e Douglas of Cavers, who was heredi|tary &s;heriff of the county, &s;till pre&s;erves the &s;tan|dard and the iron mace of the gallant lord Douglas, who fell in the battle of Otterburn, ju&s;t as his troops had defeated and taken Henry Piercy, &s;ur|named Hot&s;pur. In the church-yard of Drumal|zier, belonging to an antient branch of the Hay family, the famous Merlin is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie buried. There was an old traditional prophecy that the two kingdoms &s;hould be united, when the waters of the Tweed and the Pan&s;el &s;hould meet at his grave. Accordingly, the country people ob&s;erve that this meeting happened in con&s;equence of an inundation, at the acce&s;&s;ion of James VI. to the crown of Eng|land.</P>

<HEAD>ROXBURGHSHIRE, or TEVIOTDALE.</HEAD>
<P>This county, deriving its name from the town of Roxburgh, which is now de&s;troyed, and the river
<PB N="140" REF="1440">
Teviot, that runs through the &s;hire into the Tweed, is divided into the three di&s;tricts of Teviotdale, Liddi&s;dale, and E&s;kdale, or Eu&s;dale, &s;o called from their re&s;pective rivers, Teviot, Liddal, and E&s;k. It is bounded on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t by Northumberland and Cumberland; on the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t by Annandale; on the we&s;t by Tweedale; on the north by the Mer&s;e and Lau|derdale; extending about thirty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about fifteen in breadth from the border of England to the blue Cairn in Lauder-moor. The &s;hire exhibits a rough irregular appearance of hills, mo&s;&s;es, and mountains, inter&s;per&s;ed however with narrow vallies, and watered with delightful &s;treams. Though the face of the country is bare of woods, the valleys yield plenty of corn, and the hills abound with pa&s;ture for &s;heep and black cattle. The principal mountains of this country are known by the name of Cockraw, from whence a range of very high hills runs we&s;tward, dividing Scotland from England. On the confines of this &s;hire, are the debateable lands, the property of which was formerly di&s;puted by the Scotch and Engli&s;h bor|derers, but adjudged to the Scots at the union of the crowns. Roxburgh&s;hire yields plenty of lime and free&s;tone, which, in former times, was freely u&s;ed by the inhabitants in building ca&s;tles to defend them from the inva&s;ions of their Engli&s;h neigh|bours. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed families in this county are the Scots and Kers, who rai&s;ed them|&s;elves to wealth and honours by their bravery and &s;ucce&s;s in a &s;ort of predatory war with their ene|mies of South Britain. The &s;hire is very popu|lous; the people are &s;tout and valiant: they were formerly inured to military di&s;cipline and all the dangers of war, by living on dry marches conti|guous to tho&s;e of England; being &s;o numerous and alert, that this, and the neighbouring &s;hire of Ber|wick, could in twenty-four hours produce ten

thou&s;and men on hor&s;eback, well armed and accou|tered. In the &s;hire of Roxburgh, we &s;till meet with a great number of old ca&s;tles and &s;eats be|longing to private gentlemen, who&s;e ance&s;tors &s;ig|nalized them&s;elves in this manner; and we find the remains of old encampments, and a Roman military way, vulgarly called the cau&s;eway, run|ning from Haunum to the Tweed. The principal town called Roxburgh, giving the title of duke to the chief of the Kers, was antiently a royal bur|rough, containing divers pari&s;hes, large and flou|ri&s;hing, defended by a &s;trong citadel, which was often alternately reduced by the Engli&s;h and Scotch adventurers. It was in be&s;ieging this ca&s;tle, that king James II. of Scotland, lo&s;t his life by the bur&s;ting of a cannon. In con&s;equence of the al|mo&s;t continual wars between the two nations, this fortre&s;s was razed, the town ruined, and its royalty tran&s;lated to Judburgh, which is now a royal bur|rough &s;ituated near the confluence of the Tefy and Jed. It gives the title of lord to the elde&s;t &s;on of the marquis of Lothian; is the &s;eat of the &s;heriff's court and pre&s;bytery, a large well-built populous town, with an hand&s;ome church and town-hall, and a good market for corn and cattle. Kel&s;o, a burgh of barony, and likewi&s;e the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, is a large populous town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the bank of the Tweed, and con&s;e|quently a great thoroughfare to and from England. The hou&s;es and &s;treets are large and commodious; a very good market is held weekly in a &s;pacious &s;quare: the pari&s;h church is what remains of an antient abbey of the Ci&s;tercian monks founded by king David I. of Scotland. Here is a hou&s;e be|longing to the duke of Roxburgh, lord paramount of the town: he has likewi&s;e a noble &s;eat called Fleurs, with the gardens near the influx of the Teviot into the Tweed, about a mile from the ruins of the antient ca&s;tle of Roxburgh: here are

At Kel&s;o there is a new bridge of &s;tone built over the Tweed, which, at this place, does not divide Scotland from England; for the Scots po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome miles of territory, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river. Hawich is a &s;mall market-town on the Teviot, the royalty of which belongs to the duke of Buccleugh. Melro&s;s, or Mailros, a &s;mall burgh of barony belonging to the earl of Haddington, is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles from Kel&s;o, &s;tanding on the banks of the Tweed, hard by the famous abbey of that name, founded in the twelfth century, for Bernardine or Ci&s;tercian monks, &s;o denominated from the mona&s;tery of Ci&s;teaux in Burgundy, of which St. Bernard was a brother. The chronicle of Mailros was kept and continued by the monks of this abbey; and the in|con&s;i&s;tencies with which it abounds are attributed to the ignorance and partiality of the writers, as the abbey happened to be in the hands of the Scots or Saxons: the magnificence of the foundation &s;till appears in the ruins. The window over the great gate of the abbey is larger than that of York|min&s;ter; and round the top are the &s;tatues of Chri&s;t and the twelve apo&s;tles: the choir of the Church, which is &s;till vi&s;ible, amounts to one hun|dred and forty feet in length; and by the thickne&s;s of the foundations, there mu&s;t have been a large and &s;trong tower or &s;teeple in the centre of the church: we &s;ee likewi&s;e &s;everal fragments of the hou&s;e, the court, and offices.

<P>The &s;hire of Selkirk, otherwi&s;e called the &s;he|riffdom of Ettrick Fore&s;t, extends about twenty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and the breadth does not exceed twelve: it borders on the north with part of Tweedale and Mid-Lothian; on the &s;outh and ea&s;t, with Teviotdale; and on the we&s;t, with part of Annandale. It is a hilly country, yielding pa&s;ture for innumerable flocks of &s;heep and black cattle; and the intermediate valleys bear good harve&s;ts of hay and corn. It was formerly covered with woods, in which there were great numbers of red and fal|low deer; and hence derived the appellation of a fore&s;t; but now the woods are in a great mea|&s;ure de&s;troyed. It is well watered by many de|lightful &s;treams, of which the principal are the rivers Ettrick, Yarrow, and Gallowater. In one of the&s;e &s;treams called Glaugeber water, pieces of pure gold have been found in the &s;hape of birds eyes and eggs. Here are many agreeable &s;eats be|longing to the families of Scot, Ker, Pringle, and Murray. The people, in general, are vigorous, healthy, &s;ober, and indu&s;trious. The chief town is Selkirk, a &s;mall royal burrough, &s;ituated on the bank of the river Ettrick, about thirty miles from Edinburgh. It gives a name to the county, and the title of earl to a branch of the hou&s;e of Ha|milton; is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery; the place where the &s;heriff holds his court; has a weekly market; &s;ome annual fairs; but &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by its manufacture of &s;hoes and boots.

<P>The &s;hire of Dumfries, comprehending Annan|dale, Wachopdale, and Niddi&s;dale, is a large county, extending fifty miles in length from we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, and four and thiry in breadth; bounded on the we&s;t, with Galloway and Kyle; on the ea&s;t, by Solway Frith, and the marches of Scotland and England; on the north, by part of Clyde&s;dale, Tweedale, and Teviotdale; and on the &s;outh, by the Iri&s;h &s;ea. The country is rough and mountain|ous, not &s;o well adapted for corn, as for pa&s;ture, on which innumerable flocks of &s;heep and herds of cattle are bred and fed for exportation to Eng|land. The face of the country is bare and brown, almo&s;t de&s;titute of wood, and very deficient in fuel; yet, the vallies being watered and fertilized with abundance of &s;treams, produce good corn. The &s;hire is adorned with a great many &s;eats and plantations, thriving towns, and populous vil|lages. The people are healthy, &s;trong, and indu&s;|trious. Annandale, the fir&s;t divi&s;ion, &s;o called from the river Annan, by which it is watered, is a &s;tew|artry in the ea&s;tern part of the &s;hire, which gives the title of marquis to the chief of the family of John&s;ton, a name di&s;tingui&s;hed for warlike ex|ploits during the petty wars that almo&s;t continually raged between the borders of Scotland and Eng|land before the union of the crowns. The river Annan in its windings through this di&s;trict, which exhibits fine romantic &s;cenes of pa&s;toral beauty and fertility, receives the tribute of divers inferior &s;treams, and, after a cour&s;e of &s;even and twenty miles, falls into the Frith of Solway. The chief town, Annan, &s;tands near the mouth of the river, an antient royal burrough and &s;ea-port, which once enjoyed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of commerce; but was ruined by the incur&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, in

Lochmaben is another antient burrough on the &s;outh &s;ide of the &s;ame river, a paultry town, the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, re|markable for nothing but its ca&s;tle, now in ruins; and its lake or loch abounding with fi&s;h, and par|ticularly affording a &s;pecies peculiar to it&s;elf. This ca&s;tle belonged of old to the family of Bruce. Moffat is a neat little town; about &s;even and thirty miles from Edinburgh, famous for its medicinal wells impregnated with &s;alt and &s;ulphur; to which a great concour&s;e of company re&s;orts in the &s;um|mer &s;ea&s;on from all parts of the kingdom. The water purges like that of Scarborough, and is found efficacious in cholic and nephritic pains, and in re|moving all ob&s;tructions of the vi&s;cera. Revell and Middlebie near the Engli&s;h border, are two incon|&s;iderable places: at the fir&s;t, the inhabitants boil a bitteri&s;h &s;alt, out of the &s;ea &s;and; and the other is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery. Wauchopdale is a valley &s;o called, becau&s;e watered by the river Wauchop. Niddi&s;dale or Nithi&s;dale, lying to the we&s;tward of Annandale, is a large mountainous tract deriving its name from the river Nid, which i&s;&s;ues from a lake called Loch-cure, runs by the towns of San|quhar, Morton, and Drumlanrig, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Solway Frith. This country was formerly &s;haded with noble fore&s;ts, which are now almo&s;t de&s;troyed; &s;o that at pre&s;ent nothing can be more naked, wild, and &s;avage: yet the bowels of the earth are &s;aid to yield lead, &s;ilver, and gold; the mountains are covered with &s;heep and black cattle; and here are &s;till &s;ome con&s;iderable woods, &s;uch as that of Holy Wood, three miles from Dum|fries, noted for an hand&s;ome church built out of the ruins of an antient abbey; and al&s;o for being the birth-place of the famous a&s;trologer hence called <HI>Joannes de Sa$ro Bo&s;co.</HI></P>

The chief town, Dumfries, which may be &s;tiled the capital of the &s;outh-we&s;t part of Scotland, is a large flouri&s;hing royal burrough, &s;ituated at the mouth of the Nid, at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty-four miles from Edinburgh. The hou&s;es are well built and commodious, the &s;treets are open and &s;pacious; the town is adorned with an old ca&s;tle in tolerable repair, four gates, a &s;tately church, an exchange for the merchants, a tolbooth, a large market-place with a curious cro&s;s, and a noble bridge of free|&s;tone over the river, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen large arches, with a gate in the middle, as a boundary between the &s;hire of Dumfries, and the &s;tewartry of Galloway. Dumfries gives the title of earl to the chief of the family of Crichton; is the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery and provincial &s;ynod; and carries on a very con&s;iderable &s;hare of commerce with the Briti&s;h plantations, and divers parts of Europe. The tide flows up the river about &s;ix miles, &s;o as to bring &s;mall ve&s;&s;els up to the quay; but four miles lower, there is depth of water and &s;afe an|chorage for &s;hips of large burthen. The markets at Dumfries are well &s;upplied with fi&s;h, fowl, and butcher's meat, at rea&s;onable rates. The merchants are opulent, civil, and polite; the people, in general, indu&s;trious, wealthy, rigidly devoted to the pre&s;|byterian religion, and &s;taunch friends to the prote&s;|tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in favour of which they &s;ignalized their &s;pirit and zeal, during the rebellion of the year 1715, when they fortified the place at their own expence, re&s;olving to hold out again&s;t the earl of Nith&s;dale and other lords that declared for the Pretender. The adjacent country is beautified with many agreeable &s;eats, one of which, called Bridge End, on the other &s;ide of the river, oppo&s;ite to Dumfries, was a regality belonging to the family of Maxwell, earls of Nith&s;dale, which the la&s;t earl forfeited by rebellion.

The Cluden abounds with &s;almon, is remarkable for many high cata|racts, and di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the river Nid, or Nith. At the di&s;tance of five miles from Dum|fries, is Lochyre, a lake ten miles in length, and three in breadth, from whence i&s;&s;ues a river of the &s;ame name; forming in its cour&s;e a &s;mall i&s;land, on which there formerly &s;tood a fortre&s;s that was deemed impregnable. Glencairn, from whence the antient family of Cunningham derives the title of earl, is a &s;mall market-town within eleven miles of Dumfries. Drumlanrig is another market|town, at the di&s;tance of thirteen miles from Dum|fries, giving the title of earl to the duke of Queen&s;|bury, who, at this place, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a noble palace built of free&s;tone in form of a &s;quare, beautified with eight and twenty turrets, containing princely apartments magnificently furni&s;hed, adorned with grand avenues, exten&s;ive gardens, terrace-walks, water-works, grottos, an oak plantation &s;ix miles in length, and an elegant &s;tone bridge over the ri|ver Nith, on the banks of which it is &s;ituated. This palace has the more &s;urprizing effect, as it &s;tands in one of the wilde&s;t parts of Scotland.

Galloway is a hilly country, pretty well watered with lakes, &s;treams, and rivers; provided with divers commodious creeks and harbours on the coa&s;t; but bare of wood, and de&s;titute of fuel. It was once an independent principality governed by its own princes; and now gives the title of earl to a branch of the Stewart fa|mily. The people are tall, brawny, and robu&s;t, formerly famous for their military genius, and in all probability de&s;cended from the race of the an|tient Britons: at pre&s;ent, they are &s;ober, &s;imple, and religious, adhering to the mo&s;t rigid &s;ect of

The capital of the &s;hire is Wigtoun, which be&s;tows the title of earl upon the chief of the Flemings. It is a royal burrough, where the &s;he|riff holds his court, and the &s;eat of a pre&s;bytery, &s;ituated near the mouth of a river, in the bay of the &s;ame name, eleven miles in breadth, at the di&s;|tance of eighty-eight miles from Edinburgh. It has the advantage of a tolerable harbour, and is well &s;ituated for trade; but this is entirely neg|lected, and the town is very poor, and thinly inha|bited. At the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles from Wig|toun, &s;tands the little town of Whitherne, &s;up|po&s;ed to be the Candidaca&s;a of Bede, the epi&s;copal &s;ee of Galloway, founded by St. Ninian, who was a Briton, here he built a church dedicated to St. Martin, of an uncommon &s;tructure. Whitherne is a royal burrough and market-town, formerly famous for a noble priory. Stranraer, &s;tanding it the bottom of Lochrian, is a royal burrough and market-town, and the &s;eat of a pre&s;by|tery, with a tolerable harbour for &s;hipping; but withal a mi&s;erable place, poor, dirty, and $hin of inhabitants.

<P>England, except in a few places, exhibits to the view an inchanting variety of gently &s;welling hills, level plains, corn fields, meadow grounds, wood and water, intermingled in the mo&s;t agreeable man|ner. The champain country is parcelled out into beauteous inclo&s;ures, &s;urrounded with quick-&s;et hedges, intermixed with &s;tately oaks and elms. The farm hou&s;es, &s;cattered about in great numbers all over the face of the kingdom, appear large, neat, and convenient, in the mid&s;t of their offices or out-hou&s;es.

Cot&s;wold in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire; the Wreken in Shrop|&s;hire; with tho&s;e of Penlimmon, and Snowdon, in Wales. There are above three&s;core fore&s;ts in Eng|land; of which the chief are tho&s;e of Wind&s;or, Ep|ping, the New Fore&s;t, the fore&s;ts of Dean and of Sherwood: but, indeed, the whole kingdom looks like a fore&s;t, &s;o much is it &s;haded with trees and plantations. There are few lakes in England, con|&s;idering its extent: the large&s;t are Soham-mere, Wittle&s;ea-mere, and Ram&s;ey-mere, in the i&s;le of Ely, in Cambridge&s;hire, the fens of which, being overflowed in a rainy &s;ea&s;on, form one va&s;t lake forty miles in circumference. There is likewi&s;e Winander-mere in We&s;tmoreland; and we find &s;ome &s;mall lakes, called Derwent-waters, in Lan|ca&s;hire. England is copiou&s;ly watered with many noble rivers, which not only fertilize the ground, but likewi&s;e conduce, in a great mea&s;ure, to the improvement and pro&s;perity of commerce. The chief are the Thames, the Medway, the Severne, the Trent, the Tyne, the Tees, the Eden, the Lower Avon, the Ribble, and the Mer&s;ey. The Thames is compo&s;ed of the Thame and the I&s;is, which la&s;t is the more con&s;iderable of the two. It ri&s;es on the confines of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, receives the Churne, and runs north-ea&s;t to Lechlade, in Wilt&s;hire, where it unites with the Colne, and be|comes navigable; thence continuing its cour&s;e north-ea&s;terly, it is &s;welled by the Windru&s;h, en|ters Oxford, where it receives the Charwel; then turning &s;outh to Abingdon, proceeds to Dorche&s;ter, where it is joined by the Thame.

The Medway ri&s;es near Tunbridge, pa&s;&s;es by Maid&s;tone, runs by Roche&s;ter, where it becomes navigable, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the mouth of the Thames, by Sheerne&s;s: a river chiefly remark|able for the dock at Chatham, where &s;hips of the fir&s;t rate are built and repaired for the u&s;e of the Engli&s;h navy. The Severne, which in point of im|portance, is e&s;teemed the &s;econd river of England, derives its origin from Plenlimmon-hill in Wales; becomes navigable at Welch-Pool; runs ea&s;t to Shrew&s;bury; then turning &s;outh, vi&s;its Bridgnorth, Worce&s;ter, and Tewke&s;bury, where it receives the Upper Avon: after having pa&s;&s;ed Glouce&s;ter, it takes a &s;outh-we&s;t direction; is near its mouth in|crea&s;ed by the Wye and U&s;tre, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Bri&s;tol Channel, near King-road. The Severne runs with a rapid &s;tream, and often over|flows the adjacent country. The Trent ri&s;es in the moor-lands of Stafford&s;hire; runs &s;outh-ea&s;t by Newca&s;tle-under-Line; takes a north-ea&s;terly cour&s;e on the borders of Derby&s;hire; vi&s;its Not|tingham, watering that county as far as Lincoln|&s;hire: being joined by the Ou&s;e, and &s;everal other rivers near its mouth, it obtains the name of the Humber, and falls into the &s;ea near Hull. The Tyne, taking its ri&s;e on the borders of Cumberland, runs ea&s;terly through the whole length of Northumberland, and pa&s;&s;ing through Newca&s;tle, falls into the German &s;ea at Tin|mouth. The Tees, ri&s;ing on the confines of We&s;t|moreland, follows al&s;o an ea&s;terly cour&s;e, dividing

York&s;hire from Durham, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the German &s;ea below Stockton. The Eden runs northerly through We&s;tmoreland and Cum|berland, and pa&s;&s;ing by Carli&s;le, runs into the Solway Firth, in the neighbourhood of that city. The Lower Avon runs through Wilt&s;hire to Bath, and dividing Somer&s;et&s;hire from Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, proceeds to Bri&s;tol, and falls into the mouth of the Severne, below that city. The Ribble waters Lanca&s;hire, running a we&s;terly cour&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ing by Pre&s;ton, falls into the Iri&s;h &s;ea. The Mer&s;ey follows a north-ea&s;terly cour&s;e through Che&s;hire, dividing that county from Lanca&s;hire, and pa&s;&s;ing by Liverpool, falls into the Iri&s;h channel. Be&s;ides the&s;e rivers, we ought to men|tion the Dee, which ri&s;ing in Wales, divides Flint|&s;hire from Che&s;hire, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the channel below the city of Che&s;ter.</P>
<P>England, in mo&s;t parts, is well &s;upplied with water by &s;ubterraneous &s;prings and fountains, though very few are free of &s;ome mineral impregnation; and in many places there are medicinal wells of great efficacy in various di&s;orders incident to the human frame. The mo&s;t celebrated of the&s;e foun|tains are the hot baths of Bath and Bri&s;tol, in So|mer&s;et&s;hire, and of Buxton in Derby&s;hire; the mi|neral waters of Tunbridge, Ep&s;om, Dulwich, Acton, Harrigate, and Scarborough.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The atmo&s;phere in England is generally loaded with vapours, occa&s;ioned partly by the neighbour|hood of the va&s;t Atlantic ocean, &s;upplying it with continual exhalations wafted thither by we&s;terly winds, which blow the greate&s;t part of the year, and partly by the per&s;piration of trees and plants, with which the face of the country is covered. The
<PB N="156" REF="1600">
warmth of the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on brooding over this moi&s;ture, would produce dangerous putrid fevers, were not the air almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly ventilated by &s;udden gu&s;ts of wind or &s;torms, that blow all round the coa&s;t. The climate is more unplea&s;ant than unhealthy: the winters are cold, raw, and wet; con&s;equently much more di&s;agreeable than the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on in more northern climes, where the rivers are locked up with ice, and the inhabitants enjoy a long cour&s;e of &s;erene and &s;alutary weather. Not but that England is vi&s;ited with fro&s;t and &s;now in the winter; but the&s;e are generally of &s;hort con|tinuance: indeed the weather is &s;o variable, that it is become proverbial, and in a great degree, no doubt, affects the health, &s;pirits, and di&s;po&s;itions of the people, who are remarkably fickle and ca|pricious. The &s;pring begins in April, or rather in February; and in May, the whole country is co|vered with blo&s;&s;oms: neverthele&s;s, the winter wea|ther continues to prevail with great &s;everity, and while a man's eyes are fea&s;ted with all the pomp of vernal bloom, his nerves are chilled by the coldne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere. It is in this &s;ea&s;on that the ea&s;terly wind begins to blow with the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able effect upon vegetables, as well as upon the human body, bla&s;ting the promi&s;e of the year, and afflicting the valetudinarian with melancholy, rheums, and aches. The &s;ummer, as we have already ob&s;erved, is generally hot and moi&s;t; the autumn &s;erene, moderate, and agreeable. But the only criterion of Engli&s;h weather, is its mutability. The winter is &s;ometimes warm, and the &s;ummer cold; the &s;pring dry, and the autumn wet; nay, all the gradations of heat and cold are often felt in the compa&s;s of one day. The&s;e &s;udden tran&s;itions mu&s;t di&s;order and ob&s;truct the per&s;piration. The matter, which ought to have been thrown off by this out-let, being detained in the circulation, will

<HEAD>SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, MINERAL, VEGETABLE, and ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;oil of England is generally a rich clay, though in many places it con&s;i&s;ts of gravel and &s;and; and there is a variety of moulds and marles in dif|ferent parts of the country. Among the mine|rals of England the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is the tin of Cornwall, which is found in immen&s;e quantities, and has been famous &s;ince the Phoenicians traded to Great Britain. Wales, and divers other parts of the kingdom, yield abundance of lead, copper, and iron. The lead is impregnated with &s;ilver; and &s;ome gold has been found in Cornwall. Quar|ries of excellent free&s;tone are worked in Derby&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, and Devon&s;hire; and there is a kind of marble found in the neighbourhood of Ply|mouth. Immen&s;e quantities of coal are dug out of the pits of Northumberland, Cumberland, We&s;t|moreland, and the bi&s;hoprick of Durham: in Northumberland and Che&s;hire there is plenty of allum and &s;altpits; and the kingdom abounds with fullers earth, which is of great u&s;e in the cloth manufacture. In plenty of corn England excels all the countries of Europe. The arable lands pro|duce above five and thirty millions of bu&s;hels of wheat annually, great part of which is exported. The &s;ame quantity of barley is rai&s;ed in this king|dom, and made into malt, partly for beer and ale, and partly for the di&s;tilling of Engli&s;h &s;pirit and geneva. The poorer ground likewi&s;e yields abundance of rye, oats, pea&s;e, beans, and vetches; or in the
<PB N="158" REF="1620">
common fields the ground is &s;own alternately with wheat and hor&s;e corn, and on the third year lies fallow: but land that is well manured will produce a good crop every year. In many parts of England, the value of the land has, in a &s;mall time, been trebled, by inclo&s;ing and &s;owing it with clover, cinquefoil, trefoil, &s;aint-foin, and lucern, for hay and pa&s;ture. The kitchen gardens abound with all &s;orts of greens, roots, and &s;allads, in perfection; &s;uch as artichokes, a&s;paragus, cauli-flowers, cab|bage, coleworts, brockery, pea&s;e, beans, kidney|beans, &s;pinage, beets, lettuce, cellary, endive, turnips, carrots, potatoes, mu&s;hrooms, leeks, onions, and chalots. There are exten&s;ive fields of excel|lent &s;affron in E&s;&s;ex and Cambridge&s;hire; the woad for dying, is rai&s;ed in Bucks and Bedford&s;hire. The orchards of England, particularly tho&s;e of Hereford&s;hire, Devon&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and Kent, produce incredible quantities of apples, pears, and cherries; and every garden is &s;tored with a variety of delicate fruits, apricots, nectarines, peaches, and grapes, though it mu&s;t be owned the&s;e do not arrive at perfection in wet &s;ea&s;ons, nor do they ever acquire that exqui&s;ite flavour by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed in more &s;outhern climates. Among the fruits of England, we may likewi&s;e enumerate excellent plumbs of various genera, ra&s;berries, &s;trawberries, goo&s;eberries, and corinths. By dint of hot-beds and fire-walls, the gardeners of this country, who are the mo&s;t expert in the whole world, can rai&s;e any exotic plant, and pro|duce the mo&s;t delicate fruits that grow within the tropicks. There are few gentlemen in England, who&s;e gardens do not, in &s;ummer, exhibit the pine apple in maturity. The plants that grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in different parts of England, we &s;hall not pretend to particularize. Suffice it to &s;ay, where there is &s;uch a variety of hill and dale, &s;un

and &s;hade, &s;oil and weather, with a climate re|markably favourable to vegetation, there mu&s;t be a great collection and diver&s;ity of &s;uch herbs, &s;hrubs, and trees, as are found naturally growing in the &s;ame degree of latitude on the continent of Europe. Among the vegetable productions, how|ever, we mu&s;t not forget great quantities of flax and hemp, that are rai&s;ed in &s;ome parts of Eng|land; and the con&s;iderable plantations of hops that adorn Kent, E&s;&s;ex, Surry, and Hamp&s;hire. The chief fore&s;t trees in this kingdom are oak, a&s;h, elm, and beech: but it produces be&s;ides great plenty of walnut tree, poplar, maple, &s;ycamore, horn-beam, hazle, willow, &s;allow, elder, birch, and many other &s;pecies of wood, which are not counted timber. As for Engli&s;h oak, it is famous for yielding the be&s;t plank for &s;hipping, both in con|&s;i&s;tence, pliability, and duration.</P>
<P>The animals of England may be cla&s;&s;ed into quadrupeds, birds, fi&s;hes, reptiles, and in&s;ects. The four-footed animals which this kingdom af|fords in common with other countries, are dogs, foxes, &s;quirrels, ferrets, weazles, lizzards, newts, otters, badgers, hedgehogs, polecats, rats, mice, moles, black cattle, &s;heep, hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, and a few mules. The Engli&s;h oxen are large and fat, and the beef has a delicious flavour; yet in this parti|cular, the &s;mall breed of Wales and Scotland are preferred by epicures. The Engli&s;h &s;heep are ge|nerally large, and not &s;o valuable for their fle&s;h, as for their fleeces, which con&s;titute the original &s;taple commodity of England. Above twelve mil|lions of fleeces are annually &s;horn and manufactured in this kingdom: there is a &s;maller breed of &s;heep fed upon the downs, for mutton; and this is mo&s;t prized in all the markets, as being more firm, &s;weet, and juicy, than that which is fattened in the rank pa&s;tures of E&s;&s;ex and Lanca&s;hire.
<PB N="160" REF="1640">
England breeds beautiful hor&s;es for the &s;addle and the chace, finely proportioned, full of mettle; yet gentle, tractable, docile, and &s;o fleet, that they will run above twenty miles in an hour. There is likewi&s;e a &s;tronger breed of draught hor&s;es, admi|rably adapted for coach, carriage, waggon, or war. On the&s;e the cavalry are mounted, and they prove the be&s;t charging hor&s;es in the world, for &s;trength, weight, and &s;pirit. Among the animals peculiar to England, we ought to mention the ma&s;tifs and bull-dogs, which, in point of &s;trength and courage, exceed all animals of that &s;pecies to be found in any other part of the world. There is no creature &s;o huge and formidable that the&s;e dogs will not attack &s;ingly, whether bulls, bears, lions, or tigers, and, generally &s;peaking, they are victorious: but this &s;urpri&s;ing &s;pirit degenerates, when the&s;e dogs are tran&s;ported to any other country. This is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with the game cocks of England, remark|able for their ferocity and courage. Be&s;ides all &s;orts of poultry in perfection, turkies, peacocks, gee&s;e, &s;wans, ducks, and tame pigeons, England affords plenty of wild fowl, &s;uch as bu&s;tards, wild gee&s;e, wild ducks, teal, wigeon, plover, phea&s;ants, partridge, wood-cocks in the &s;ea&s;on, grow&s;e, quail, landraile, &s;nipe, wood-pigeons, hawks of different kinds, kites, owls, herons, crows, rooks, ravens, magpies, jack-daws, and jays, blackbirds, thru&s;hes, nightingales, goldfinches, linnets, larks, and a great variety of &s;mall birds, common to other countries.</P>
<P>The rivers and ponds of England abound with &s;almon, trout, eels, pike, perch, &s;melts, carp, tench, barbles, gudgeons, roach, dace, mullet, bream, plaice, flounders, and craw-fi&s;h, be&s;ides a delicate lake fi&s;h called char, which is found in &s;ome fre&s;h water lakes of Wales and Cumberland.

mackarel, hadock, whiting, herrings, pilchards, &s;kaite, &s;oles, and many other fi&s;h of divers denomi|nations; over and above plenty of &s;hell-fi&s;h, &s;uch as oy&s;ters, lob&s;ters, crabs, and &s;hrimps. The coa&s;t of England is &s;eldom vi&s;ited by whales; but there are great numbers of porpu&s;&s;es tumbling about in the channel, and many &s;eals upon the rocks, at the extremity of the i&s;land. The reptiles of this coun|try, are adders, vipers, &s;nakes, and worms: the in&s;ects &s;uch as are found in other parts of Europe, humble bees, wa&s;ps, ants, gnats, and flies in great variety.</P>

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION, GOVERNMENT, LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The Engli&s;h con&s;titution is a limited monarchy, and, with all its defects, may be con&s;idered as the be&s;t that ever was reduced to practice in any part of the world, whether we con&s;ider the dignity of the crown, or the happine&s;s of the community. The legi&s;lative power is ve&s;ted in the king, lords, and commons a&s;&s;embled in parliament, and no law can be made without the concurrence of all three. The hou&s;e of lords is compo&s;ed of all the peers of the realm, &s;piritual and temporal: the commons, including the Scotch members, amount in number to five hundred and fifty-eight. They are cho&s;en every new parliament by the counties and boroughs, and, in their collective body, are &s;uppo&s;ed to repre|&s;ent the people of England. A new parliament is cho&s;en once in &s;even years, in con&s;equence of writs i&s;&s;ued by the crown: the king likewi&s;e has power to prorogue and di&s;&s;olve this a&s;&s;embly at his plea|&s;ure; as well as to refu&s;e a&s;&s;ent to any bill, without giving any rea&s;on for the refu&s;al. He enjoys a re|venue called the civil li&s;t, amounting to eight hun|dred thou&s;and pounds a year, for the maintenance of his hou&s;hold, the payment of foreign mini&s;ters,
<PB N="162" REF="1680">
and any other purpo&s;es in which he may think pro|per to employ it: he is ve&s;ted with the power of creating peers, appointing all the great officers of &s;tate, judges, and commi&s;&s;ioners, and of be&s;towing all the lucrative employments of the common|wealth, civil as well as military. He contracts al|liances, declares war, levies troops, augments the navy, builds fortifications, concludes peace; and, in a word, conducts the whole admini&s;tration of the government by his own power and authority; though the two hou&s;es of parliament in&s;i&s;t upon the privilege of enquiring occa&s;ionally into every branch of the admini&s;tration. The peers, though originally created by the crown, enjoy their honours by here|ditary de&s;cent; and when guilty of trea&s;on, or any other capital crime, they are tried by the whole hou&s;e of peers, being &s;ubject to no other juri&s;dic|tion. The hou&s;e of peers can apprehend, and com|mit any man, except a member of the lower hou&s;e, for breach of privilege, or reflections again&s;t their judicature: the commitment is very chargeable to the per&s;on &s;o offending; but at the ri&s;ing of the par|liament, he is relea&s;ed of cour&s;e. The hou&s;e of lords is the la&s;t re&s;ort in all civil cau&s;es of appeal from inferior courts of judicature. They can try a member of the lower hou&s;e, on an impeachment by the commons; but no pro&s;ecution can be com|menced again&s;t a commoner, in the hou&s;e of lords. They can bring into the upper hou&s;e any bill for making a new law, except it relates to the revenues or public taxes. The&s;e, called Money Bills, cannot be fir&s;t introduced into the hou&s;e of peers; nor can the lords alter them when they are &s;ent up by the commons, though they may reject them entirely. No peer is &s;ubject to per&s;onal arre&s;t in actions of debt, and every lord in his private capacity may bring an action of <HI>&s;candalum magnatum</HI> in the court
<PB N="163" REF="1690">
of King's Bench, again&s;t any per&s;on that &s;hall de|fame his character.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of commons con&s;i&s;ts of five hundred and fifty-eight members: of the&s;e, eighty knights repre&s;ent the forty counties of England; twelve &s;tand for the counties of Wales, and thirty for the &s;hires of Scotland. The citizens of England are repre&s;ented by fifty citizens; the boroughs, by three hundred and thirty-nine burge&s;&s;es; the two univer&s;i|ties, by four members; and the eight cinque ports, by &s;ixteen barons. Wales returns twelve burge&s;&s;es, and Scotland fifteen. The commons of England rate all the &s;upplies of the year according to the exi|gencies of government; and this is a province on which they will not allow the hou&s;e of peers to en|croach. They amend differences in the law, and defects in government, by new &s;tatutes: they im|po&s;e taxes, grant &s;ub&s;idies, and limit the number of land forces, &s;hips, and &s;eamen, for the &s;ervice of the year: they take the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for the improvement and regulation of commerce, the en|couragement of manufacture, and the benefit of the community. They commit delinquents who have given offence to the hou&s;e, whether they are, or are not members; but the&s;e are relea&s;ed of cour&s;e at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. They &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ume the power of enquiring into the conduct of mini&s;ters and per&s;ons who have acted in a public capacity. They call for papers and records, bring in bills of attainder, and impeach even peers at the bar of the upper hou&s;e. They enjoy many other powers and privileges, which we cannot pretend to enumerate. They &s;peak freely and boldly on all &s;ubjects, without any other controul, than that of their &s;peaker, whom they elect into the chair at the beginning of every parliament, and pre&s;ent to the king for his approbation. For this honourable of|fice, they always chu&s;e a gentleman of character,
<PB N="164" REF="1700">
well acquainted with the forms and bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, who can direct them in their proceedings and, in the cour&s;e of their debates, re&s;trict them by his authority within the bounds of decorum. He appears in black robes, &s;its in an elevated chair a the upper end of the hou&s;e with his hat on, and the mace before him; walks at the head of the com|mons from their hou&s;e or chamber to the hou&s;e of peers, in order to attend his maje&s;ty, when he goes thither to pa&s;s the bills; and harangues the &s;ove reign in the name of the commons of England In a word, the hou&s;e of commons takes cognizance of every thing in which the oeconomy and intere&s;t of the public are concerned; and perhaps would be more than a match for the other two branches of the legi&s;lature, were not the king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch advantages, as, if properly managed, will always weaken and overcome the oppo&s;ition of the com|mons. The liberty and privileges of an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, are founded on the Magna Charta, o$ great charter, extorted by the barons from king John, and afterwards confirmed by his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or Henry III. and &s;ome additional indulgen|cies have been obtained of weak princes, by the &s;pirit of the commons. One of the mo&s;t valuable rights of an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, is that of his being tried by a jury of his peers or equals, who &s;it in court during the trial, and bring in their verdict <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty,</HI> according to the nature of the evidence, without acquie&s;cing in the opinion of the judge, when it happens to be contradictory to their own. Another privilege of equal importance, i$ that of the writ <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> by means of which every per&s;on that is impri&s;oned, can demand the cau&s;e of his commitment, immediate trial, or in|&s;tant relea&s;e. The people of England cannot b$ taxed in any &s;hape, or under any denomination without their own con&s;ent, that is, without the
<PB N="165" REF="1710">
concurrence of the majority of their repre&s;entatives in parliament. No &s;oldiers can be quartered in any private hou&s;e, without the owner's con&s;ent; and every individual can di&s;po&s;e of his own effects ac|cording his own plea&s;ure, either by will, deed, or conveyance. The con&s;titution of England, though &s;aid to be as perfect as human wi&s;dom could &s;ugge&s;t, and human frailty permit, yet, neverthele&s;s, contains in it&s;elf the &s;eeds of its own di&s;&s;olution. While individuals are corruptible, and the means of cor|ruption &s;o copiou&s;ly abound, it will always be in the power of an artful and ambitious prince to &s;ap the foundations of Engli&s;h liberty. By means of the places and pen&s;ions in his gift, he will be able to procure a majority in parliament, devoted to his will. He has it in his power to model the army to his wi&s;hes. The parliament can protract its own date, con&s;equently perpetuate it&s;elf. The com|mons can gradually increa&s;e the number of land forces, until the nation is &s;addled with a &s;tanding army devoted to the crown, &s;ufficient to trample upon the con&s;titution, and di&s;po&s;ed to obey the mo&s;t arbitrary commands of their &s;overeign. Then will the parliament become the &s;laves of the army they have reared. This was actually the ca&s;e in the u&s;urpation of Cromwell; and had his &s;ucce&s;&s;or inherited his talents and ambition, in all probability the tyranny would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed on a &s;olid foundation, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantages he laboured under, as a private man and an up&s;tart, who rai&s;ed him&s;elf over the heads of many compe|titors, &s;uperior to him&s;elf in preten&s;ion and influence: di&s;advantages which could never attend the arbi|trary de&s;igns of a &s;overeign, rai&s;ed by birth above all competition, and already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of royal au|thority. Thus one branch of the legi&s;lature will always be able to influence the other two; and the crown being ve&s;ted with the executive power, the
<PB N="166" REF="1720">
command of the forces by &s;ea and land, the prero|gative of making treaties and alliances, of creating peers and bi&s;hops, to &s;ecure a majority in the upper hou&s;e, and being reinforced by a venal hou&s;e of commons, may ea&s;ily acquire and e&s;tabli&s;h an ab|&s;olute dominion. Such a &s;cheme, however, mu&s;t be executed by gradual innovation, &s;tealing, as it were, imperceptibly on the con&s;titution. An open and bold violation would alarm and arou&s;e the &s;pirit of the people, who are equally jealous, and well informed of their own privileges, in vindication of which they might throw them&s;elves into the arms of a patron, who&s;e emi&s;&s;aries are ever active, and who numbers friends in every corner of the king|dom. The interior government of England is the peculiar province of the parliament, &s;o far as laws and regulations are concerned. The laws them&s;elves con&s;titute an immen&s;e body, or col|lection, begun by Ina, one of the kings of the Saxon heptarchy, &s;ince who&s;e reign they have been occa&s;ionally altered, amended, enlarged, and mul|tiplied, in &s;uch a manner, that they are become a grievance to the &s;ubject, and indeed a reproach to the nation. Every thing is &s;o incumbered with form, involved in doubt, and over-&s;hadowed with ob&s;curity, that a man can take no &s;tep relating to his own property or effects, without the advice of lawyers, the number of whom, including attornies, &s;ollicitors, and clerks, is &s;aid to exceed thirty thou|&s;and within the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. At pre&s;ent the Engli&s;h laws are compounded of the civil law, the common law, or Saxon law, the for|re&s;t law, the &s;tatute law, manour law, mar&s;hal law, and franchi&s;es, or peculiar laws founded upon royal grants and charters, confirmed by acts of parliament.</P>
<P>The judges of England, appointed by the king, are twelve in number, di&s;po&s;ed in different courts of
<PB N="167" REF="1730">
judicature, and divided into certain circuits, for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice through all parts of the realm. The tribunals held at We&s;tmin&s;ter are the courts of King's-Bench, Common-Pleas, Chan|cery, Exchequer, and the dutchy chamber of Lan|ca&s;ter. The highe&s;t court of common law in England is the King's-Bench, &s;o called, becau&s;e of old the king pre&s;ided here in per&s;on. At pre|&s;ent, his power is ve&s;ted in the lord chief ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench, &s;tiled by preheminence the lord chief ju&s;tice of England, created by a &s;hort writ from the &s;overeign; and he is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by three inferior judges, con&s;i&s;ted by letters patent. This tribunal takes cognizance of every thing that con|cerns the lo&s;s of life or member of any &s;ubject; of trea&s;ons, felonies, breaches of the peace, oppre&s;&s;ion, and mi&s;government; and it hath power to revi&s;e and rectify errors and mi&s;takes, in the &s;entences and proceedings of all the judges and ju&s;tices of England: in a word, to &s;uperintend all pleas, ex|cept tho&s;e in the Exchequer. The juri&s;diction of the court extends over all the kingdom: for the law pre&s;umes, that the &s;overeign is always per&s;on|ally pre&s;ent. The court of Common-Pleas, held by another lord chief ju&s;tice, and three a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, created by letters patent, tries all civil cau&s;es, real, per&s;onal, and mixed, between &s;ubject and &s;ubject. The court of Chancery was in&s;tituted as a court of equity, to mitigate the rigour of the common law: but, in fact, there is a double judicature included in this tribunal; for the court of Chancery proceeds either according to the laws of the land, in the Latin lan|guage, granting writs of grace, mandatory and remedial; or by Engli&s;h bill, according to equity and con&s;cience. This court i&s;&s;ues writs of &s;um|mons for parliament, charters, protections, &s;afe|conducts, and patents for &s;heriffs; and in Chancery are &s;ealed and inrolled all letters patent, treaties

with foreign princes; all deeds touching the pur|cha&s;e of lands or e&s;tates, extents upon &s;tatutes, re|cognizances for payment of money, and &s;ecuring contracts, commi&s;&s;ions of appeal, and of oyer and terminer. The &s;upreme judge is the lord chancel|lor, keeper of the great-&s;eal, &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of lords, moderator of the common law; in a word, the fir&s;t civil officer in the kingdom. He is pro|vided with twelve a&s;&s;i&s;tants, called ma&s;ters in Chancery, the chief of whom, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, is an officer of great dignity, who hears cau&s;es in the ab&s;ence of the chancellor, is keeper of the rolls, and has &s;everal profitable places in his gift. All the judges of England are di&s;tingui&s;hed by particular robes, and appear in their &s;everal characters with great pomp and dignity. The court of Exchequer, &s;o called, either from a chequered cloth that covered the table, or, which is more probable, from the French word <HI>&eacute;chiquier,</HI> &s;ignifying a che&s;s-board, becau&s;e ac|comptants formerly made u&s;e of &s;uch in their cal|culations, is an antient court of records, in which all cau&s;es touching the revenue and rights of the crown, are heard and determined. The judges of this tribunal are the lord chief baron, and three other barons; and here likewi&s;e &s;its a pui&s;ne baron, who admini&s;ters the oath to all high-&s;heriffs, under-&s;heriffs, bailiffs, auditors, receivers, collectors, comp|trollers, &s;urveyors, and &s;earchers, of all the cu&s;toms in England. The Exchequer includes two courts, one of law, another of equity. All judicial pro|ceedings, according to law, are tran&s;acted before the barons; but the court of equity is held in the Exchequer chamber, before the trea&s;urer, chan|cellor, and barons. The inferior officers belong|ing to the court of Exchequer, are the king's re|membrancer, the trea&s;urer's remembrancer, clerk of the pipe, comptroller of the pipe, clerk of the
<PB N="169" REF="1750">
pleas, foreign oppo&s;er, clerk of the e&s;treats, au|ditors of the impre&s;t, auditors of the revenue, re|membrancer of the fir&s;t fruits, auditor of the fir&s;t fruits, receiver of the revenue of the fir&s;t fruits, deputy chamberlains, clerk of the parcels, clerks of the nails, the mar&s;hal, the chief u&s;her of the Ex|chequer, four under-u&s;hers, and &s;ix me&s;&s;engers. In the Lower Exchequer, where the king's revenue is received and di&s;bur&s;ed, the principal officer is the lord trea&s;urer; but this office is now generally put in commi&s;&s;ion. Next whom is the chancellor of the Exchequer, an officer of great authority, who &s;its above the barons, has an under-trea&s;urer, and many places in his gift. In the cu&s;tody of the two chamberlains of the Exchequer are many antient records and treaties, the &s;tandards of money, weights, and mea&s;ures, the black book of the Exchequer, and the famous Doom&s;day book, compiled by order of William the Conqueror, in which all the lands of England, except the Bi&s;hoprick of Durham, and the three northern counties, are de&s;cribed, with an exact account of all the cities, towns, and villages of England, the number of families, men, &s;oldiers, and hu&s;band|men, bond&s;men, &s;ervants, and cattle; the quan|tity of money, rent, meadow, pa&s;ture, wood, til|lage, common, mar&s;h, and heath, that every in|dividual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. All differences and di&s;putes concerning taxes or impo&s;itions are determined by this regi&s;ter, which is kept under three locks and keys, not to be opened except upon payment of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence, and not to be tran|&s;cribed under fourpence for every line. The au|ditor of the receipts of the Exchequer files the bills of the tellers, by which they charge them&s;elves with all money received, draws all orders to be &s;igned by the lord high trea&s;urer, for i&s;&s;uing money by virtue of privy &s;eals, makes debentures to the
<PB N="170" REF="1760">
&s;everal per&s;ons who enjoy fees, annuities, or pen|&s;ions, by letters patent from the king, out of the Exchequer, and directs them for payment to the tellers. He knows every day the &s;tate of the ac|count of each teller, and weekly certifies the whole to the lord high trea&s;urer, or lords commi&s;&s;ioners. He at Michaelmas and Lady-day delivers to the lord trea&s;urer, and the chancellor of the Exche|quer, a declaration, containing a methodical ab|&s;tract of all accounts and payments made in the preceding half-year: he keeps the &s;everal regi&s;ters appointed for paying all per&s;ons in cour&s;e, upon &s;everal branches of the king's revenue: he is <HI>&s;crip|tor talliorum,</HI> provided with five clerks to manage the whole e&s;tate of monies received, di&s;bur&s;ed, and remaining. He that pays or lends money to the king receives for his acquittance or acknowledge|ment, a tally, or piece of &s;tick, in&s;cribed on both &s;ides with the acquittance, expre&s;&s;ing the u&s;e for which the money is received: this tally being cloven a&s;under by the deputy chamberlains, one half, called the &s;tock, is delivered to the per&s;on that pays the money; and the other part, called the counter-&s;tock, or counter-foil, they keep, and afterwards tran&s;mit to the other deputies, to be pre|&s;erved, till demanded, in order to be joined with the &s;tock: this being done, they &s;end it by an offi|cer of their own to the Pipe, to be applied to the di&s;charge of the accountant. This antient way of &s;triking tallies hath been found, by long experience, the be&s;t method that ever was invented for preventing fraud and forgery: for it is morally impo&s;&s;ible &s;o to counterfeit a tally, but, that upon rejoining it with the counterfoil, the fraud will ob|viou&s;ly appear by examining and comparing the notches, cleaving, length, breadth, natural growth, or &s;hape of the two pieces. The four tellers re|ceive all money due to the king, and for each &s;um
<PB N="171" REF="1770">
received, throw down a bill through a pipe, into the tally court, where it is received by the auditor's clerk, who there attends to write the words of the bill upon a tally, and delivers it to be entered by the clerk of the Pells: then the tally is cloven by the two deputy chamberlains; and while the &s;enior reads one part, the other is examined by the junior. The clerk of the Pells enters the teller's bill on a parchment &s;kin, whence the office derives its name, as well as all receipts and payments for the king, for what cau&s;e, or by whom&s;oever. He hath four clerks, and is in the nature of a comptroller. The tally cutter attends in the Tally-court, with the de|puties of the two chamberlains.</P>
<P>The court of the dutchy chamber of Lanca&s;ter con&s;i&s;ts of the chancellor of the dutchy as chief judge, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the attorney of the dutchy, and divers other officers. He takes cognizance of all cau&s;es that concern the revenue of that dutchy, which is now annexed to the crown. All the&s;e courts of judicature &s;it in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and are opened at the four terms of Ea&s;ter, Trinity. Michaelmas, and Hillary. The pleading lawyers, denominated coun&s;el, are educated at the inns of court, which are &s;eminaries for &s;tudents in the law; and after a man has been entered as member of any &s;uch &s;ociety, he is called to the bar, where he always appears in a black gown, until he at|tains to the degree of &s;erjeant at law, and then he is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a coif and particular kind of robe. The twelve judges not only admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in the courts of the metropolis, but likewi&s;e hold a&s;&s;izes all over the kingdom, twice a-year, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. England is divided into &s;ix cir|cuits, for each two judges are allotted. Wales is comprehended in two circuits, for which the like number of judges is a&s;&s;igned.

<P>Be&s;ides the civil government of England in ge|neral, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the particular government of counties, hundreds, cities, boroughs, and villages. In order to pre&s;erve the tranquillity of the country, the king, in every county, appoints by commi&s;&s;ion, under the great &s;eal, certain ju&s;tices of the peace, and one of the principal ju&s;tices is created <HI>cu&s;tos rotulorum,</HI> &s;o denominated becau&s;e he is keeper of the rolls or records of the &s;e&s;&s;ions. Such of the ju&s;tices as are deemed mo&s;t worthy of the king's confidence, are called ju&s;tices of the <HI>quorum,</HI> from their being expre&s;sly mentioned in the com|mi&s;&s;ion, as per&s;ons, one of whom, <HI>quorum unum,</HI> mu&s;t be pre&s;ent when any matter of importance is tran&s;acted. The office of the ju&s;tices of the peace is to examine and commit to pri&s;on, all thieves, murderers, vagrants, rioters, and other delinquents, who occa&s;ion a breach of the peace, or di&s;turb the quiet of the community. They impri&s;on all &s;uch as cannot be bailed by &s;ureties, and produce them in due time to trial. They are likewi&s;e impowered to act in a judicial capacity, and to put certain laws and &s;tatutes in execution, namely, tho&s;e relating to the poor, the repairs of the highways, the puni&s;h|ment of vagrants, and di&s;orderly per&s;ons. The ju&s;tices of the &s;everal counties meet every three months at certain places, appointed by the <HI>cu&s;tos ro|tulorum,</HI> to hold there quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions. There the grand inque&s;t, or jury of the county, is &s;ummoned to appear, that they may upon oath make inquiry of all delinquents; and tho&s;e that appear to be guilty are by the ju&s;tices committed to pri&s;on, to be tried at the next a&s;&s;izes, before the judges of the circuit.</P>
<P>For the execution of the laws, the king annually nominates a &s;heriff for every county of England,
<PB N="173" REF="1790">
except We&s;tmoreland and Durham. His office is to execute the king's mandates, and all writs di|rected to him out of the king's courts; to impan|nel juries; to bring cau&s;es and criminals to trial, and &s;ee the &s;entences executed; to attend and guard the itinerant judges; to collect all public cu&s;toms of the county, all fines, di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and amerciaments to be brought into the Exchequer; to return knights for parliament, &s;uppre&s;s riots, execute writs, &s;ecure pri&s;oners, di&s;train for debts, &s;uperintend the execution of malefactors. The &s;heriff executes all proce&s;&s;es and precepts of the courts of law, and makes the returns of all &s;uch. He holds the coun|ty court, in which he hears and determines civil cau&s;es of the county under forty &s;hillings. In a word, he is the chief con&s;ervator of the peace in the whole county; and, for the better performance of the different functions, is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by an under &s;heriff, divers clerks, &s;tewards of courts, bailiffs of hun|dreds, con&s;tables, goalers, &s;erjeants or beadles. The &s;heriff is always a man of fortune, &s;ufficient to &s;up|port the dignity of his office, particularly to main|tain a gallant train of &s;ervants in rich liveries, all mounted on hor&s;eback, for the reception of the judges. Every county is, moreover, provided with a certain number of high con&s;tables, <HI>cu&s;todes pacis,</HI> who&s;e office is to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the con&s;ervation of the peace; to di&s;per&s;e warrants and orders of the ju&s;tices to each petty con&s;table. There are al&s;o two coro|ners cho&s;en by the freeholders of the county, by virtue of a writ from Chancery, to inquire, by a jury of neighbours, into the violent death of every &s;ubject, and to enter the cau&s;e and manner of &s;uch death upon record. Finally, there is in every coun|ty a clerk of the market, who&s;e office is to keep a &s;tandard of all weights and mea&s;ures, exactly a|greeing with the king's &s;tandard kept in the Ex|chequer: to prevent any other from being u&s;ed in
<PB N="174" REF="1800">
the county, to &s;eal all weights and mea&s;ures made exactly by this &s;tandard in his cu&s;tody, and to burn &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The civil government varies a little in the cities, boroughs, and villages of England, according to the nature of their charters granted by different princes. Every city, being an epitome of the mo|narchical government, is ruled by a mayor, alder|men, and common council, analogous to the king, lords, and commons. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, who is the king's lieutenant, is annually cho&s;en from a|mong the aldermen; and the common council in|cludes individuals of all profe&s;&s;ions or employments followed in the place. Every city enjoys a juri&s;|diction within it&s;elf, to judge in all matters civil and criminal: but all civil cau&s;es may be removed to the higher courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter; nor does the magi&s;tracy take any cognizance of capital offences: they are impowered, however, to make bye-laws for the government of the city; and the chief ma|gi&s;trate, whether mayor, alderman, or portreve, enjoys the power of a ju&s;tice of the peace within his own liberty, during the year of his office. Boroughs are properly tho&s;e towns that &s;end burge&s;&s;es to par|liament, and are governed, &s;ome by a mayor, others by bailiffs, and a few by an alderman or portreve. In villages, the lord of the manour is generally ve&s;ted with a power, to hold a court ba|rony every three weeks, for the better government of the inhabitants: but they are more immediately under the check of ju&s;tices of the peace, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by petty con&s;tables, who are &s;ub&s;ervient to their ju|ri&s;diction. In every pari&s;h there is a petty con&s;ta|ble annually cho&s;en, to keep the peace in ca&s;e of broils or quarrels; to &s;earch any hou&s;e for crimi|nals; to rai&s;e the hue and cry after robbers or murderers; to &s;eize all &s;uch, and detain them in the &s;tocks, cage, or other pri&s;on, until they can con|veniently
<PB N="175" REF="1810">
bring them before &s;ome ju&s;tice of the peace.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hments inflicted on civil criminals in England, are different from tho&s;e adjudged in other countries. High trea&s;on, petit trea&s;on, rape, bug|gery, murder, and felony, are capital crimes by the laws of this country. A traitor is hanged up, cut down immediately, opened alive, and embowelled; then he is quartered, and his head and members are expo&s;ed in eminent places. This puni&s;hment, which is a di&s;grace to humanity, was executed lite|rally, with every circum&s;tance of barbarity, upon the convicted rebels in the year 1746. But in no|blemen, this &s;entence is, by the indulgence of the crown, always changed into decapitation; and the criminal in that ca&s;e is beheaded with an ax on a public &s;caffold. A traitor is not quit for his own life; but his conviction is attended with the ruin of his family. He forfeits all his lands and goods: his wife lo&s;es her dowry: his children are deprived of their nobility, and right of inheritance. Coiners, though adjudged guilty of high trea&s;on, are only hanged and drawn. Petit trea&s;on, comprehending the murder of a ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s by a &s;ervant, of a hu&s;band by his wife, of a bi&s;hop by a clergy|man, who owes him obedience, is puni&s;hed by drawing the criminal to the gallows on a hurdle, and hanging him by the neck until he be dead, ex|cept in the ca&s;e of a female, who for high trea&s;on as well as petit trea&s;on, is &s;entenced to be drawn and burned alive. All other capital crimes are puni&s;hed by hanging; and in ca&s;es of murder, the body of the criminal is adjudged to the &s;urgeons, to be by them di&s;&s;ected in public. If a per&s;on in|dicted of a capital crime, refu&s;es to an&s;wer, and put him&s;elf upon a legal trial, he is deemed liable to incur the puni&s;hment called <HI>peine forte et dure,</HI> inflicted in this manner. Being &s;ent back to the
<PB N="176" REF="1820">
pri&s;on from whence he came, he is laid upon his back naked on the bare floor of a dark room, and his arms and legs racked with cords drawn through iron rings, fa&s;tened at the four corners of the apart|ment; then an immen&s;e weight of iron and &s;tone is laid upon his body. Next day, he receives three mor&s;els of barley bread, without drink; and on the morning of the third day, he is pre&s;ented with foul water, fetched from the neare&s;t kennel, with|out bread; the &s;ame diet is repeated &s;o long as he lives. There are in&s;tances of criminals who have had re&s;olution enough to endure the&s;e horrible tor|tures, that their e&s;tates might not be forfeited to the king, but de&s;cend to their own children. This &s;avage law continues &s;till in force, but is now &s;eldom executed: the criminal is now at once loaded with additional weight until he expires. In ca&s;e of high trea&s;on, however, the criminal, even though he refu&s;es to plead, may be convicted, and his e&s;tate confi&s;cated. In atrocious ca&s;es of murder and rob|bery, the criminal's body is, after execution, hung in chains upon a gibbet, by the road &s;ide, where it continues to rot, to the great annoyance of travel|lers, and the prejudice of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s hou&s;es and lands in the neighbourhood, which no tenant will occupy on this account. In &s;ome kinds of fe|lony, the criminal e&s;capes with his life by being intitled to the benefit of his clergy; a privilege fir&s;t granted to eccle&s;ia&s;tics, afterwards extended to tho&s;e of the laity who could read and write; and, finally, indulged to all &s;ubjects, whatever, in all &s;uch ca&s;es of felony, as are not expre&s;sly excepted by acts of parliament: but even where the benefit of clergy is allowed, the criminal is marked in court with a red hot iron, on different parts of his body, according to the nature of his crime. A per&s;on convicted of perjury, by bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s upon oath in a court of record, is &s;et in the pillory, and branded
<PB N="177" REF="1830">
in the forehead: the trees growing upon his ground are rooted up, and his goods are confi&s;cated. Forge|ry is puni&s;hed with death. By concealing trea&s;on, which is called mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, a man for|feits the profits of his lands and goods during life, and is condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment. He that &s;trikes another within the king's court, &s;o as to draw blood, is doomed to lo&s;e his right-hand, which is cut off in a &s;ad and &s;olemn manner, ac|cording to the direction of the law. The &s;erjeant of the king's yard brings to the place of execu|tion a &s;quare block, a beetle, a &s;taple and cords to fa&s;ten the criminal's hand: the yeoman of the &s;cul|lery provides a great fire of coals to heat the &s;ear|ing irons, which are brought by the chief farrier: the groom of the &s;awcery finds vinegar and cold water: the yeoman of the cellar and pantry, mu&s;t be pre&s;ent to admini&s;ter a cup of red wine and a manchet to the criminal: the &s;erjeant of the ewry brings linen for a bandage: the yeomen of the poultry comes with a cock to be applied to the &s;tump: the yeoman of the chandlery provides cere|cloths: the ma&s;ter-cook finds a &s;harp dre&s;&s;er-knife, which, at the place of execution, is held upright by the &s;erjeant of the larder, until the operation is performed by an officer appointed for that pur|po&s;e. The criminal, after having undergone this execution, may be impri&s;oned during life, or fined and ran&s;omed at the king's plea&s;ure. No &s;uch pu|ni&s;hment, however, has been for many years inflict|ed. A man, by &s;triking another in We&s;tmin&s;ter|hall while the courts of ju&s;tice are &s;itting, incurs impri&s;onment for life, and forfeiture of all his e&s;tate. Petty larceny, or &s;mall theft, under a cer|tain value, is puni&s;hed with &s;courging: a &s;uicide, unle&s;s found lunatick by the coroner's inque&s;t, is held <HI>felo de &s;e,</HI> interred by the highway without chri&s;tian burial, a &s;take is driven through his body,
<PB N="178" REF="1840">
and his goods are forfeited. Drunkards, vagabonds, profane &s;wearers, loo&s;e and di&s;orderly per&s;ons, are puni&s;hed by being &s;et in the &s;tocks, as well as by pecuniary mulcts: &s;colding women are ducked in a chair called the <HI>ducking &s;tool,</HI> contrived for that purpo&s;e: other mi&s;demeanors are puni&s;hed by fine or impri&s;onment, or both.</P>

<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed hierarchy of England is a pro|te&s;tant epi&s;copal church; but liberty of con|&s;cience being allowed, a great variety of &s;ects hath &s;prung up &s;ince the reformation, and all &s;orts of religion are either connived at or tolerated: indeed, the church of England is the mo&s;t mild and moderate eccle&s;ia&s;tical in&s;titution, which hath ever appeared in any part of chri&s;tendom. The king of England is acknowledged as &s;upreme head of the Anglicane church, governed by two archbi&s;hops and twenty-four &s;uffragans, each of the&s;e enjoying the title of lord, on account of the barony annexed to his lord&s;hip, and having precedence immedi|ately after vi&s;counts, in parliament as well as in other a&s;&s;emblies. The two archiepi&s;copal &s;ees, are tho&s;e of Canterbury and York, to which all the other dioce&s;es of England and Wales are &s;ubject. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury is &s;tiled the pri|mate of all England, is the fir&s;t peer of the king|dom; precedes all dukes and great officers of the crown, next the royal family; performs the cere|mony of the coronation; is denominated in the king's writs, <HI>Dei gratia archiepi&s;copus Cantuarien&s;is,</HI> and &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>divina providentia,</HI> whereas other prelates write <HI>divinu permi&s;&s;ione.</HI> He is acco&s;ted both in &s;peech and writing, with the title of <HI>your grace,</HI> or, <HI>mo&s;t reverend father in God.</HI> Within his own province, he hath by common law, the power
<PB N="179" REF="1850">
of probate of all te&s;taments, and that of granting letters of admini&s;tration of the goods and chattels of all &s;uch as die inte&s;tate, either within or with|out his province. He is impowered to grant li|cences and di&s;pen&s;ations in all ca&s;es heretofore &s;ued for at the court of Rome, that are not repugnant to the law of God, or the king's prerogative. He can con&s;ecrate a bi&s;hop, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two other prelates, call provincial &s;ynods according to the king's arret, and pre&s;ide at tho&s;e &s;ynods or con|vocations, vi&s;it the whole province, appoint a guar|dian of the &s;piritualities during the vacancy of any bi&s;hopric within his province, whereby all the epi&s;|copal rights of that dioce&s;e belong to him, as do all eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;dictions. He is ve&s;ted with the power of holding divers courts of judicature for deciding differences in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; he may retain and qualify eight chaplains; and enjoys many other prerogatives and privileges as metropo|litan of all England. The dioce&s;es contained in the province of Canterbury, are tho&s;e of London, Winche&s;ter, Ely, Lincoln, Roche&s;ter, Litchfield and Coventry, Hereford, Worce&s;ter, Bath and Wells, Sali&s;bury, Exeter, Chiche&s;ter, Norwich, Glouce&s;ter, Oxford, Peterborough, Bri&s;tol; and in Wales, the bi&s;hoprics of St. David's, Landaff, St. A&s;aph, and Bangor. The archbi&s;hop of York is &s;tiled primate of England, and metropolitan; hath place and precedence of all dukes next to the royal family, and all great officers of &s;tate except to the lord chancellor; is addre&s;&s;ed with the title of <HI>your grace,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t reverend father in God;</HI> hath the privilege to crown the queen con&s;ort, and is her perpetual chaplain: he al&s;o can qualify eight chaplains, and enjoys many prerogatives and privi|leges within his own province, which comprehends the bi&s;hoprics of Durham, Carli&s;le, and Che&s;ter, be&s;ides that of Soder and Man, which is a kind of a
<PB N="180" REF="1860">
detached dioce&s;e. All the bi&s;hops of England are peers and barons. They are feudal barons in con|&s;equence of the lands and baronies annexed to their bi&s;hoprics: they are barons by writ, as being &s;um|moned by the king's writ to parliament; and they are created barons by patent, exhibited to the arch|bi&s;hop at their con&s;ecration. They have the pre|cedence of all temporal barons under vi&s;counts, and enjoy many extraordinary privileges preferable to tho&s;e of lay noblemen. A bi&s;hop, by his epi&s;co|pal order, may ordain prie&s;ts and deacons; dedi|cate churches and burying-places; admini&s;ter the rites and ceremonies of confirmation; and the power of ordination is in&s;eparable from his office. The juri&s;diction of a bi&s;hop is either ordinary or de|legated: as a bi&s;hop, he has a power to licence phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, and &s;chool-ma&s;ters; to unite and con&s;olidate &s;mall pari&s;hes, yet this power is en|joyed at pre&s;ent by no prelate in England, except the bi&s;hop of Norwich, and that only within a cer|tain di&s;tance; to a&s;&s;i&s;t the civil magi&s;trate in the execution of &s;ome &s;tatutes concerning eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, to compel the payment of tenths and &s;ub|&s;idies, which formerly belonged to the crown, but are now given for the augmentation of &s;maller be|nefices. He is impowered to in&s;i&s;t upon the pro|bate of wills; to grant admini&s;tration to the heirs of tho&s;e who die inte&s;tate; to give orders for col|lecting and pre&s;erving peri&s;hable goods, when no per&s;on is willing to admini&s;ter; to exact an account of admini&s;trations; to collate benefices; to grant in&s;titutions to benefices upon pre&s;entations of other patrons; to command induction to be given; to order the profits of vacant benefices to be collected and pre&s;erved for the u&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; to de|fend the franchi&s;es and liberties of the church; to vi&s;it their particular dioce&s;es once in three years, and make inquiry into the morals and doc|trines
<PB N="181" REF="1870">
of the clergy as well as laity. In every ca|thedral church there is a dean and chapter, the fir&s;t being an officer next in dignity to the bi&s;hop, in|&s;talled by virtue of the king's letters patent; the other con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of prebenda|ries as canons. The dean, and &s;ome of the pre|bendaries, are occa&s;ionally &s;ummoned by the bi&s;hop, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in ordinations, deprivations, condem|nations of heretics, and in denouncing the &s;entence of excommunication. Next to the deans are the arch-deacons, of whom there are &s;ixty in the king|dom of England. Their office is, in obedience to the bi&s;hop's mandate, to induct clerks into their benefices, or, in other words, to give him po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions; to vi&s;it the dioce&s;e two years in three, to know the condition of the churches with re&s;pect to nece&s;&s;ary reparations and moveables; to reform ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical abu&s;es, and make a repre&s;entation of all matters of con&s;equence to the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e. There were formerly rural deans, to &s;uperintend the conduct of pari&s;h prie&s;ts; but now they are not u&s;ed. Pari&s;h prie&s;ts are called rectors, unle&s;s the great tythes are impropriated; and, in that ca&s;e, they are denominated vicars. Their office is to take care of the &s;ouls of their pari&s;hioners, to in&s;truct the ignorant, reform the wicked, recon|cile differences, perform divine &s;ervice, admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, preach, teach, marry, baptize, re|turn public thanks after child-bearing, vi&s;it the &s;ick, bury the dead, and keep a regi&s;ter of all chri&s;ten|ings, marriages, and burials, that happen within the pari&s;h. Deacons are impowered to baptize, read prayers in the church, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the prie&s;t at the Lord's &s;upper, by giving the cup only. Curates are per&s;ons in holy orders, employed for a certain &s;tipend, to a&s;&s;i&s;t rectors and vicars in their different functions. In every pari&s;h there are church-war|dens, elected annually by the prie&s;t and the pari&s;hi|oners,
<PB N="182" REF="1880">
to keep the church in good repair, and pro|perly adorned, and &s;ee that nothing be wanting to divine &s;ervice; to take care that the church-yard be properly enclo&s;ed, to &s;uperintend the wants of the inhabitants, pre&s;ent &s;candalous livers to the ordi|nary, collect the charity of the pari&s;hioners, and ex|ecute the orders of the bi&s;hop. The lowe&s;t retainer to the church is the &s;acri&s;tan, commonly called the &s;exton or clerk, cho&s;en by the par&s;on and pari&s;h, qualified to read, write, and &s;ing p&s;alms, and &s;ub|&s;ervient to the prie&s;t, curate, and church-wardens.</P>
<P>The great a&s;&s;embly of the clergy is a na|tional &s;ynod or convocation, &s;ummoned to meet at a place a&s;&s;igned by the king's writ, directed to the archbi&s;hop of each province. In con&s;equence of this addre&s;s, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury directs his mandate to the bi&s;hop of London, as his pro|vincial, willing him to cite all the bi&s;hops, deans, archdeacons, and all the clergy of his province, to a&s;&s;emble at a certain time and place, and directing that one proctor may be &s;ent for each cathedral and collegiate church, and two for the body of the inferior clergy of each dioce&s;e. The convocation is divided into two hou&s;es: the higher hou&s;e in the province of Canterbury con&s;i&s;ting of two and twenty prelates, of which the archbi&s;hop is pre&s;i|dent; and the lower hou&s;e being compo&s;ed of all the deans, archdeacons, and proctors, to the num|ber of one hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix, including twenty-two deans, twenty-four prebendaries, fifty-four archdeacons, and forty-four clerks, repre&s;enting the dioce&s;an clergy. The convocation was a&s;&s;embled at the beginning of every parliament, and continu|ed &s;itting during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the parliament. It was u&s;ually convoked in St. Paul's church, from whence the archbi&s;hop adjourned them to We&s;t|min&s;ter; the bi&s;hops, under their metropolitan, a&s;|&s;embling in Henry VII's chapel, while the lower
<PB N="183" REF="1890">
hou&s;e, under a prolocutor of their own choo&s;ing, met in the Jeru&s;alem chamber. The bu&s;ine&s;s of this a&s;&s;embly was to deliberate and con&s;ult about the concerns of the church, and &s;uperintend her legi&s;lative power. In a word, it was deemed a part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; but is now &s;et a&s;ide, for the convocation has not been allowed to &s;it and do bu&s;ine&s;s, except at one time, &s;ince the reign of queen Anne. The archbi&s;hop of York may hold a convocation of his province in the &s;ame manner, and, by means of a regular corre&s;pondence with the other, debate and determine the &s;ame matters that are canva&s;&s;ed and concluded in this &s;ynod of Can|terbury; not that the province of York is at all re|&s;tricted by the tran&s;actions and determinations of the &s;outhern convocation.</P>
<P>The church of England is likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of civil juri&s;diction, exerted in different tribunals; and in the&s;e all trials are conducted according to the civil and canon law, the judges having neither a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors nor jury, but pronouncing &s;entence by virtue of his own under&s;tanding and prerogative. The court of Delegates, though it takes cogni|zance of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, can hardly be num|bered among the juri&s;dictions of the church, as it is the re&s;ource of tho&s;e who appeal from the de|crees or &s;entences given in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, by the archbi&s;hop, or any of his officials. The judges are here delegated, and &s;it by virtue of the king's commi&s;&s;ion, under the great &s;eal, to hear &s;uch ap|peals to his maje&s;ty as &s;upreme head of the church. Each archbi&s;hop hath a vicar-general, and every bi&s;hop appoints a chancellor, by whom all epi&s;copal power and juri&s;diction are executed. The&s;e vicars-general and chancellors are created by letters-pa|tent, under the &s;eals of the re&s;pective metropolitans and bi&s;hops, and confirmed by the dean and chap|ter of three &s;everal cathedrals. To every chapter,
<PB N="184" REF="1900">
a particular juri&s;diction and eccle&s;ia&s;tical court be|long. In the&s;e, the judge, who is u&s;ually a doctor of the civil law, tries before the vicars-general and chancellors, all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es within their re|&s;pective dioce&s;es, except the bi&s;hop, or ordinary, &s;hould grant letters of reque&s;t to the party, that he may &s;ue in the court of Arches, which is the highe&s;t court of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. The court of Arches derives its name from the arched church and tower of St. Mary le Bow, in London, where it was u&s;ually held. The judge, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of dean of the arches, &s;its without any a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors, and determines cau&s;es without a jury. He takes cognizance of appeals, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, within the province of Canterbury; and all proce&s;s is returnable before him, in the common-hall of Doctors Commons. The pleaders and &s;ollicitors of this court are known by the appellation of ad|vocates and proctors; the fir&s;t being doctors of the civil law, and, by the &s;tatutes of the court, the pleadings and petitions ought to be in the Latin tongue. The court of Audience is held, when the archbi&s;hop evocates a cau&s;e to his own hearing, in|terfering in any difference between parties, con|cerning elections and con&s;ecrations of bi&s;hops, ad|mi&s;&s;ion and in&s;titution into benefices, and di&s;pen|&s;ing with bans of matrimony. The court of Pre|rogative, which likewi&s;e &s;its in the common-hall of Doctors Commons, is al&s;o held in the name of the archbi&s;hop, <HI>jure prerogativae &s;uae,</HI> and takes cogni|zance of e&s;tates fallen by will, or by inte&s;tates. The judge is attended by the regi&s;ter and his deputy, who record all the decrees of the court, and all ori|ginal wills of per&s;ons having <HI>bona nota bilia.</HI> In the Prerogative-office, a man, for one &s;hilling, may peru&s;e every &s;uch will that has been regi&s;tered &s;ince the in&s;urrection of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, by whom many records were burned and de&s;troyed

in the reign of king Richard II. Certain pari&s;hes, in &s;everal dioce&s;es, are exempt from the juri&s;diction of their re&s;pective bi&s;hops, and ruled by a court of Peculiars, belonging to the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury. Be&s;ides the&s;e tribunals, con&s;tituted for the u&s;e of the whole province, every bi&s;hop holds his court in the cathedral of his own dioce&s;e, where his chancellor &s;its as judge, and decides by the canon and civil law. The dean and chapter al&s;o hold a court, in which cognizance is taken of cau&s;es hap|pening in places belonging to the cathedral; and the archdeacon hath a court and juri&s;diction, in which &s;mall differences are determined. Finally, there are certain peculiar juri&s;dictions belonging to &s;ome pari&s;hes, the inhabitants of which are ex|empt, &s;ometimes from the bi&s;hop's, and &s;ome|times from the archdeacon's juri&s;diction; but &s;ub|jected to their re&s;pective prebendaries. The pun|i&s;hments inflicted by eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts are various, according to the nature of the offence, including &s;eclu&s;ion from the &s;acrament, public penance, which is generally commuted for a &s;um of money, denial of chri&s;tian burial, and the &s;entence of ex|communication, by which a man is di&s;abled from being plaintiff in a proce&s;s, and in a great mea&s;ure deprived of the protection of the law. The puni&s;h|ments peculiar to the delinquents among the clergy are the&s;e, <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;io ab officio,</HI> when a mini&s;ter is, for a certain time, declared unfit to perform the func|tions of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic; <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;io a beneficio,</HI> when, for a certain time, he is deprived of the profits of his benefice; <HI>deprivatio a beneficio,</HI> when, for a greater crime, he is deprived of his benefice for ever; and, la&s;tly, <HI>deprivatio ab officio,</HI> when, for &s;ome capital crime, he is &s;olemnly degraded by the bi&s;hop, who, with his own hands, &s;trips him of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical ve&s;tments, and the en&s;igns of his order, and delivers him to the civil magi&s;trate, to be puni&s;hed as a layman, according to the nature of his offence.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="1920">
The clergy of England enjoy certain privileges with which the laity are not indulged. An eccle|&s;ia&s;tic pays no toll for his goods in fair or market; he is exempted from per&s;onal functions or &s;ervices of the commonwealth, &s;uch as tho&s;e of &s;heriff, con&s;table, over&s;eer of the poor, and other pari&s;h offices; his goods are likewi&s;e di&s;charged from tolls and cu&s;toms, unle&s;s he deals in traffick: he is not to be di&s;turbed or mole&s;ted in the execution of his function; he is not to be fined or amerced according to his &s;piritual, but according to his tem|poral means: he is not obliged to &s;erve in war, nor in the leet, nor bound to follow the hue and cry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hue and cry, de|rived from the French words <HI>huer</HI> and <HI>crier,</HI> is the pur&s;uit of a murderer or felon, con|ducted by the con&s;table of the hundred, upon due infor|mation made to this officer, who calls upon the pari&s;h for aid; and if the criminal is not found in his di&s;trict, gives warning to the con&s;table of the next pari&s;h: in this manner &s;earch is made from hundred to hundred, beginning at the place where the crime was committed, and continuing to the &s;ea-&s;ide, in the line which the criminal followed, unle&s;s the felon be taken be|fore they proceed &s;o far.</NOTE>; nor be burned in the hand, though convicted of a crime, for which he is allowed benefit of his clergy: and the privilege of clergy, which no layman has above once, he enjoys from time to time <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> If a hundred be &s;ued for a robbery, and is taxed to make good the damage, the mini&s;ter pays no part of the contribution; nor is he a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for watching, or warding, or mending the highways.</P>
<P>The revenues of the church are not near &s;o con|&s;iderable as they were before the reformation; &s;ome of the bi&s;hopricks, however, are very wealthy, and all of them &s;ufficient to maintain the dignity of the &s;everal incumbents. The annual revenues in &s;everal dioce&s;es exceeds five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The Engli&s;h bi&s;hops are remarkable for their learn|ing, piety, and charity; but they do not affect the
<PB N="187" REF="1930">
&s;plendour and ho&s;pitality by which their prede|ce&s;&s;ors, in the prelacy, were di&s;tingui&s;hed. The benefices of England are altogether in&s;ufficient for the maintenance of the clergy; nearly one third of the be&s;t livings in the kingdom, having been an|tiently appropriated to mona&s;teries by the pope's grant, were converted into lay fees, when tho&s;e mona&s;teries were di&s;&s;olved by Henry VIII. Be&s;ides, there are many large e&s;tates, wholly exempted from the payment of tythes, either as lands which for|merly belonged to mona&s;teries, or through corrupt compo&s;itions, contracts, and cu&s;toms. Moreover, one eccle&s;ia&s;tic is capable of holding two livings, be&s;ides a deanery or prebend; &s;o that a few, who have intere&s;t, engro&s;s all the be&s;t benefices, and the re&s;t of the clergy are but poorly accommodated. The mini&s;ters of England are generally &s;en&s;ible, moderate, and exemplary in their deportment. Their &s;ermons are well compo&s;ed, and di&s;tinctly de|livered, yet without that emphatic manner, and tho&s;e &s;trokes of popular oratory, which intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions of the audience. They pique them|&s;elves upon the &s;ound rea&s;oning, the elegance of &s;tile, and the correctne&s;s of compo&s;ition, rather than the pathos of their di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>The clergy of the church of England have been very in&s;trumental in forming divers religious &s;o|cieties for the reformation of manners, for propa|gating the go&s;pel in foreign parts, and for promot|ing chri&s;tian knowledge. The endeavours of the&s;e &s;ocieties have been crowned with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, by the voluntary contributions of well-di&s;po&s;ed people, that many mi&s;&s;ions are e&s;tabli&s;hed in different parts of the world, for making converts to the pro|te&s;tant communion; many thou&s;ands of bibles, and other religious books, pamphlets, and &s;ermons, have been di&s;tributed for the propagation of chri&s;ti|anity, and the reformation of manners: and a
<PB N="188" REF="1940">
great number of charity &s;chools have been erected in different parts of the kingdom. The number of the&s;e at pre&s;ent mu&s;t exceed fifteen hundred, in which above forty thou&s;and children of both &s;exes are taught to read, write, and repeat the catechi&s;m. The fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e &s;chools at London was owing to the unwearied diligence of the &s;ociety, in &s;olliciting &s;ub&s;criptions, and voluntary contribu|tions, to the plans which they formed, and the di|rections which they publi&s;hed. The charitable people of the country followed the example of the metropolis; &s;o that &s;chools were &s;oon opened in all parts of the i&s;land. The &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign parts, and that for promoting chri&s;tian knowledge, were united in one corpora|tion by a royal charter of king William III. It con&s;i&s;ts of above four hundred per&s;ons, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of the &s;itting and corre&s;ponding mem|bers. The former meet every week at St. Paul's chapter-hou&s;e in London, and contribute annually to the expence of the undertaking: the corre&s;pond|ing members are not obliged to contribute; but when they come to the metropolis, they have a right to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the weekly meetings of this &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e public a&s;&s;ociations, we may like|wi&s;e number that of the &s;ons of the clergy, incor|porated by king Charles II. for the relief of poor widows and children of eccle&s;ia&s;tics; and the corpo|ration for an augmentation to poor livings, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by queen Anne, who, with unparralleled ge|nero&s;ity, granted the whole revenue of fir&s;t fruits and tenths towards this charitable in&s;titution.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the Roman catholics, which are pretty numerous in England, divers penal laws have been enacted, in con&s;equence of frequent attempts which individuals of that communion have made to &s;ub|vert the con&s;titution: but the&s;e laws are &s;eldom or never executed; and the papi&s;ts of this kingdom

enjoy greater liberty of con&s;cience than is allowed to prote&s;tants in any catholic &s;tate of Europe, where no &s;uch practices can be laid to their charge.</P>
<P>England, &s;ince the reformation, has been famous for religious &s;ects, that enjoy their fanatici&s;m with|out mole&s;tation; of the&s;e the chief are the pre&s;by|terians, independents, anabapti&s;ts, and quakers. The independents and anabapti&s;ts differ not much, in point of doctrine and di&s;cipline, from the pre&s;byterians, whom we have already de&s;cribed in the account of Scotland; except in the article of infant bapti&s;m, which is rejected by the anabap|ti&s;ts, who bapti&s;e adults only, and thereby dipping the whole body; whence they derive the name of anabapti&s;ts. The quakers are, perhaps, the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;ect that ever any religion produced. They di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church in &s;ome of the fundamental doctrines of chri&s;tianity; and, in their outward deportment, &s;tudy to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the re&s;t of mankind. They re|ject the &s;acraments of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;up|per, the ordination of mini&s;ters, and, indeed, all the rites and ceremonies of the church. They do not acknowledge the my&s;teries of the trinity, incar|nation, and hypo&s;tatical union: they doubt about the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t in the body, with which he appeared to St. Thomas: they deny the re&s;urrec|tion of the fle&s;h: and pretend to be conducted in all things by the &s;pirit, a &s;ort of inward light or illu|mination. About the year 1624, when the king-dom was over&s;pread with fanatici&s;m in all its wild|ne&s;s and extravagance, this &s;ect was founded by one George Fox, a native of Lanca&s;hire, whom his fa|ther had bound apprentice to a &s;hoe-maker. This ignorant fellow feeling a greater propen&s;ity to &s;piritual contemplations, than to the employment in which he was engaged, de&s;erted his ma&s;ter, and
<PB N="190" REF="1960">
&s;trolled about the country in a leathern doublet, with his bible in his pocket. He broke off all communication with his friends and family, and pa&s;&s;ed whole days in hollow trees, indulging the wilde&s;t reveries of ignorant enthu&s;ia&s;m. Having &s;ettled within him&s;elf his plan of reformation, he began to make pro&s;elytes, and was very &s;ucce&s;sful in his endeavours. He, and his di&s;ciples, not only rejected all rites of religion; but carefully avoided the common forms of civility, as the inventions of carnal vanity and &s;elf-conceit. They refu&s;ed to be|&s;tow any titles of di&s;tinction, or to acco&s;t any per|&s;on by any other &s;alutation than that of <HI>friend.</HI> They would neither bend their bodies, move their hats, nor expre&s;s the lea&s;t &s;igns of reverence and re&s;pect. They reduced their language to the &s;im|plicity of <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee, yea</HI> and <HI>nay,</HI> terms which they u&s;ed to all per&s;ons without di&s;tinction of rank or character. They laid a&s;ide every &s;uperfluity and ornament in dre&s;s, &s;uch as plaits to the coat, but|tons to the &s;leeve or hat, lace, ruffles, and em|broidery. Such violence of enthu&s;ia&s;m, founded on the opinion of a directing &s;pirit within them, could not fail to produce &s;trange effects upon the nerves of the body. Their bodies were agitated by convul&s;ions, di&s;tortions, and tremblings of the limbs; and hence they derived the name of quakers. They con&s;idered the&s;e agitations as the motion of the holy &s;pirit, and uttered extempora|neous effu&s;ions, twanged through the no&s;e, as the oracles of in&s;piration. They would admit no prie&s;t into their &s;ociety, believing that each individual was already &s;tamped with a much &s;uperior character, by means of divine illumination. At their meet|ings, every per&s;on who felt the inward motion was qualified to preach and to teach: even women were con&s;idered as proper vehicles to convey the dictates of the holy &s;pirit: &s;ometimes many per&s;ons were
<PB N="191" REF="1970">
moved to &s;peak at once: &s;ometimes the whole congregation was &s;ilent. They refined likewi&s;e in their morals. They preached up univer&s;al peace and forbearance, and con&s;equently inveighed again&s;t war and the arm of fle&s;h. A quaker being a&s;ked for his cloak, gave his coat al&s;o; when &s;mote upon the cheek, he held up the other: no con&s;ideration would induce him to &s;wear, even to the truth, in any court of judicature: nor if he dealt in merchan|dize, would he demand for his wares more than the preci&s;e &s;um which he was re&s;olved to have. The zeal of the quakers was often too hard for their di&s;cretion, and they played a thou&s;and extra|vagant pranks that &s;avoured more of lunacy than of religion. They broke into churches, and di&s;|turbed the public wor&s;hip, by railing at the mi|ni&s;ter, and reproaching the congregation. The &s;pirit moved them to revile all per&s;ons that did not adopt their doctrines and principles. They held forth in churches, &s;treets, and courts of judicature, undervaluing wor&s;hip, bu&s;ine&s;s, and proceedings at law: they uttered bla&s;phemies, and &s;educed zealots from the army. A female quaker went &s;tark naked into a church where Oliver Cromwell a&s;&s;i&s;ted at divine &s;ervice, and &s;aid &s;he was moved by the &s;pirit to appear as <HI>a &s;ign</HI> to the people. A great number of them fancied the revolution of all things was begun, and threw away their cloaths, with the re&s;t of their &s;uperfluities. Such irregula|rities could not fail to attract the notice of the civil power. They were &s;ometimes confined to mad|hou&s;es; &s;ometimes &s;ent to pri&s;on; many were &s;courged in public, and a few &s;et in the pillory. All the&s;e &s;everities they bore with &s;uch patience, that they were believed to be &s;upported by &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance. James Naylor fancied him&s;elf Chri&s;t, the Saviour of the world, and pretended to work miracles. He attempted to rai&s;e a per&s;on from
<PB N="192" REF="1980">
the dead: he entered Bri&s;tol mounted on a hor&s;e, while his di&s;ciples &s;pread their garments before him, crying Ho&s;anna to the highe&s;t! holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of &s;abaoth: when apprehended as a bla&s;phemer and impo&s;tor, and brought before the civil magi&s;trate, he would make no other an&s;wer to the que&s;tions that were put to him, but "thou ha&s;t &s;aid it." The behaviour of this frantic en|thu&s;ia&s;t attracted the attention of the parliament, which, after ten days &s;pent in debates and enquiries about him, condemned him to be &s;et in the pillory, to be &s;courged, burned in the face, and have his tongue bored through with a red hot iron. All the&s;e &s;everities he bore with patience, and even a kind of triumph: but when he was committed to the hou&s;e of correction, debarred all communica|tion with his di&s;ciples, kept to hard labour, and fed with bread and water, his illu&s;ions di&s;&s;ipated: he found him&s;elf no more than an ordinary man, and, being &s;et at liberty, retired quietly to his former occupation. The quakers of England have formed them&s;elves into a body, governed by cer|tain regulations, and are, perhaps, more united than any other &s;ociety, whether civil or religious, in all chri&s;tendom. They hold &s;tated a&s;&s;emblies monthly and quarterly in London, and other great towns, where they likewi&s;e have meetings for their wor&s;hip. All the different branches of this &s;ociety in Great Britain, Ireland, and the plantations, cor|re&s;pond together by regular communications: they encourage and &s;upport one another in refu&s;ing the payment of tythes, which they account an abomi|nation: they even cen&s;ure and excommunicate the back-&s;liding brethren, and keep exact regi&s;ters of all their tran&s;actions. This &s;ect has not been em|braced by any per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, except Wil|liam Penn, who &s;ettled the province of Pen&s;ylva|nia, and founded the flouri&s;hing city of Phila|delphia,

<HEAD>Of the KING.</HEAD>
<P>The monarch of England is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the titles of George, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king, defender of the faith. He &s;tiles him&s;elf king of France from an antient claim which his predece&s;&s;ors had to that kingdom, of which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es nothing at pre&s;ent but three or four incon&s;iderable i&s;lands on the coa&s;t of Normandy. The title, defender of the faith was an antient appellation given to the kings of England; but more particularly confirmed by Leo X. to Henry VIII. in con&s;equence of a book written by this prince again&s;t Luther, in defence of the &s;even &s;acraments. The title was afterwards continued by act of parliament. The king of England is &s;upreme head of the church, and chief magi&s;trate of the kingdom. He has the &s;upreme right of patronage, paramount over all the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical benefices in England: he is the &s;upreme civil judge, and the fountain from which all ju&s;tice is derived. His per&s;on is accounted &s;o &s;acred, that the laws of England have fixed the penalty of high
<PB N="194" REF="2010">
trea&s;on even upon tho&s;e who imagine or intend only the death of their &s;overeign; though, in all other capital ca&s;es, an Engli&s;hman cannot be puni&s;hed with death, unle&s;s an act follows the intention. Nay, an ideot or lunatic, whom as a per&s;on <HI>non compos mentis,</HI> the law holds incapable of commit|ting felony, or any other &s;pecies of trea&s;on, is puni&s;hed with death as a traitor, if he either kills, or attempts to kill the king of England. The &s;ame penalty is inflicted upon tho&s;e who kill certain offi|cers of the crown, or any of the king's judges ex|ecuting their office, as well as upon tho&s;e who coun|terfeit the king's &s;eal or his monies, becau&s;e by all the&s;e his per&s;on is repre&s;ented. The king of Eng|land promi&s;es on oath, at his coronation, to pre|&s;erve the rights and privileges of the church and clergy, the royal prerogatives belonging to the crown, the laws and cu&s;toms of the realm; to do ju&s;tice, love mercy, maintain peace and unity. The chief articles of prerogative enjoyed by the kings of England, we have enumerated in our ac|count of the parliament: but, there are many others of le&s;s con&s;equence, which the confined nature of our plan will not allow us to particularize. It may &s;uffice to &s;ay, that in point of dignity, pomp, and revenue, he rivals the greate&s;t monarchs in Chri&s;ten|dom; and though he is re&s;tricted by the laws of the kingdom, and the privileges of the &s;ubject, from exerci&s;ing any open acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, he is &s;upplied with all the power and means which a good prince could wi&s;h to enjoy, for making him|&s;elf great, and his people happy. His civil li&s;t, or private revenue, amounts to 800000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;terling year|ly: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many ca&s;tles, palaces, parks, and fore&s;ts, for re&s;idence and diver&s;ion: he is per&s;onally treated with the utmo&s;t reverence and re&s;pect by his &s;ubjects, who kneel when they pre&s;ent their ad|dre&s;&s;es to him: at all times he is &s;erved upon the
<PB N="195" REF="2020">
knee, and all per&s;ons, whatever, &s;tand waiting with heads uncovered in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The royal &s;tate of his Britannic maje&s;ty is &s;up|ported by a great number of extraordinary ceremo|nies and appointments. Over and above the oeco|nomy of his hou&s;hold, which is in all re&s;pects &s;uit|able to the grandeur of a great monarch, the pro|vi&s;ion made for the immediate defence of his per|&s;on is equally magnificent and effectual. The palace and its precincts are defended by detachments from a body of foot guards, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even battalions quartered in the neighbourhood, who take their turns in this honourable department of duty. They are fine &s;hewy troops, always fre&s;h in their cloathing, neat and clean in every article of dre&s;s, arms, and accoutrements; and every regiment is provided with an excellent band of mu&s;ick, which plays every morning when the guard is relieved at the palace. The hor&s;e-guards, otherwi&s;e known by the name of the life-guards, con&s;i&s;t of &s;even hundred and twenty-four hor&s;emen, divided into two troops, and each of the&s;e &s;ubdivided into four &s;quadrons. They are well mounted and accoutred, and cloathed in &s;carlet, adorned with gold lace. Two &s;quadrons with trumpets mount guard one day in &s;ix, and are relieved in their turns. They attend the king in detachments where&s;oever he goes, and parties are detached from the guard to give their attendance on the prince of Wales. When his maje&s;ty walks on foot, one of the cap|tains attends next to his per&s;on, carrying in his hand an ebony &s;taff or truncheon, headed with gold, and engraved with his maje&s;ty's cypher and crown. An|other commi&s;&s;ioned officer follows the captain, that he may relieve him occa&s;ionally, with an ebony &s;taff, having a &s;ilver head; and two inferior bri|gadiers likewi&s;e attend with ebony &s;taves, at a greater di&s;tance. There are al&s;o two troops of gre|nadier
<PB N="196" REF="2030">
hor&s;e-guards, who have their own di&s;tinct officers, and are cloathed in a different manner from the life-guards, with which, however, they mount guard by divi&s;ions. They perform duty on foot, in attending the king when he walks abroad, and always march with great detachments.</P>
<P>Over and above the&s;e external guards of hor&s;e and foot, there is a military government maintain|ed within the king's hou&s;e, above as well as below. There is a band of forty gentlemen pen&s;ioners, one half of whom are always upon duty in the pre&s;ence chamber, where they receive the king when he comes forth from his privy-lodgings. They at|tend his per&s;on to and from the chapel royal, as well as at all great &s;olemnities, coronations, St. George's fea&s;t, when he goes to parliament, and when he gives public audience to amba&s;&s;adors. They are richly cloathed in &s;carlet trimmed with broad gold lace, are commanded by a captain, who is generally a nobleman of the fir&s;t rank, un|der whom there is a lieutenant and &s;tandard-bearer. This pen&s;ion was originally intended for a mainte|nance to decayed gentlemen; but now it is &s;old like any other &s;ine-cure to the be&s;t bidder. Their arms were gilt pole-axes, except in time of war, when they appeared on hor&s;eback, armed like cui|ra&s;&s;iers, with &s;words and pi&s;tols. At pre&s;ent, they wear &s;words only.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the pen&s;ioners, there is another guard of one hundred yeomen, who attend in the fir&s;t room above &s;tairs, called the guard-chamber. They are cho&s;en for their large and portly &s;tature, cloathed in long &s;carlet coats, richly guarded with black velvet, and adorned with badges of embroidery, both before and behind. In&s;tead of hats, they wear broad crowned caps of black velvet, decked with ribbons of the king's colour. Their arms are long parti&s;ans and &s;words: they are commanded by
<PB N="197" REF="2040">
exempts. They have an allowance of wages and diet; and their duty is to attend the king's per&s;on at home and abroad, thirty-&s;ix waiting by day, and eighteen watching by night. The&s;e places can hardly be called military, as they are generally &s;old to per&s;ons who never carried arms in the &s;ervice; &s;o that they are kept, not &s;o much for u&s;e, as for &s;tate and pageantry.</P>
<P>The royal atchievement, borne by the reigning family, is thus mar&s;halled, quarterly, in the fir&s;t grand quarter Mars, three lions pa&s;&s;ant-guardant in pale, Sol, the imperial en&s;igns of England: the&s;e are impaled with the royal arms of Scotland, con&s;i&s;ting of Sol, a lion rampant within a double tre&s;&s;ure flowered and counterflowered, with fleurs delis, Mars. The &s;econd quarter contains the arms of France, namely, Jupiter, three fleurs de lis, Sol. The third, for Ireland, exhibits Jupiter, an harp, Sol, &s;tringed, Luna. In the fourth grand quarter is repre&s;ented his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's own coat of arms, being Mars, two lions pa&s;&s;ant-guar|dant, Sol, for Brun&s;wick, impaled with Lunen|burgh, giving Sol, &s;eme&eacute; of hearts, proper, a lion rampant, Jupiter, having for antient Saxony, Mars, an hor&s;e current, Luna, grafted in ba&s;e; and in a &s;hield &s;urtout, Mars, the diadem, or, a crown of Charlemagne; the whole &s;urrounded with a garter, as &s;overeign of that order. Above the helmet, as the emblem of &s;overeign juri&s;diction, is an imperial crown; the cre&s;t, a lion pa&s;&s;ant-guardant crowned with the like: the &s;upporters, a lion rampant-guardant, Sol, crowned as the former; and an unicorn, Luna, gorged with a crown, and chained. The royal motto is, <HI>Dieu et mon droit,</HI> implying that the king of England holds his crown of God only. The table of the compartment is adorned with the ro&s;e and thi&s;tle intermingled, as the emblem of the union of England and Scotland.</P>

The elde&s;t &s;on of the king of England is born duke of Cornwall, and afterwards created prince of Wales, with letters-patent, by which the &s;aid principality is granted to him and his heirs, kings of England. He bears the king's arms, with the addition of a label of three points, charged with nine torteaux; his device being a coronet beautified with three o&s;trich feathers, in&s;cribed <HI>Ich dien,</HI> &s;igni|fying in the German language, I &s;erve: this de|vice was borne at the battle of Cre&s;ci by John, the blind king of Bohemia, who &s;erved as a volunteer in the French army, and was &s;lain fighting hand to hand with Edward the Black Prince. The prince of Wales enjoys certain privileges that no other &s;ub|ject can claim. The per&s;on who imagines his death, or violates his wife, is deemed guilty of high trea&s;on. The prince is pre&s;umed to be of age as &s;oon as born, and may, on the day of his birth, &s;ue for the livery of the dukedom of Cornwall; and he may qualify any number of chaplains. What he receives annually from the dutchy of Cornwall, does not exceed fourteen thou&s;and pounds: but the revenue of the late prince of Wales, as e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by act of parliament, amounted to one hundred thou&s;and pounds, clear of all deductions. The younger &s;ons of the king are not born, but created dukes or earls; yet they are by birth coun&s;ellors of &s;tate: and all the children of the king are ad|dre&s;&s;ed with the title of royal highne&s;s. The daughters are &s;tiled prince&s;&s;es, and it is deemed high trea&s;on to violate the elde&s;t unmarried.</P>

<HEAD>GREAT OFFICERS of the CROWN.</HEAD>
<P>Next to the king and princes of the blood, we &s;hall de&s;cribe the great officers of the crown, of whom there are nine ranks, the high-&s;teward, lord high chancellor, lord trea&s;urer, lord pre&s;ident, lord
<PB N="199" REF="2060">
privy-&s;eal, lord chamberlain, con&s;table, earl mar|&s;hal, and lord high admiral. Antiently the highe&s;t office in England, under the king, was that of lord high-&s;teward, &s;o called from the Saxon words <HI>&s;tede</HI> and <HI>ward locum tenens,</HI> properly &s;peaking, a viceroy. The law &s;tiled him, <HI>Magnus Angliae Se|ne&s;challus,</HI> and his power was &s;o exorbitant, that it is not now tru&s;ted in the hands of any &s;ubject. A &s;teward, however, is created occa&s;ionally, <HI>pro hac vice,</HI> to officiate at a coronation, and pre&s;ide at the trial of peers for trea&s;on or felony. During his &s;teward&s;hip, he bears in his hand a white &s;taff, which, when the trial is determined, he breaks, and &s;o his office ends. The office of the lord chancellor we have already de&s;cribed in our account of the courts of judicature; the name <HI>cancellarius</HI> is derived from one part of his office, that is the power he has to cancel what he thinks ami&s;s, in any patent, commi&s;&s;ion, or warrant, &s;ent from the king to be &s;ealed with the great &s;eal. The words to be cancelled, he expunges by drawing cro&s;s lines over them, like lattices, called in Latin, <HI>can|celli;</HI> or el&s;e he acquired this appellation by &s;itting antiently <HI>intra cancellos,</HI> within &s;uch a partition as now &s;eparates the church from the chancel. The &s;alary of this great po&s;t amounts to above &s;even thou&s;and pounds a year; but of late, it has been cu&s;tomary for per&s;ons who accept the office, to re|ceive a large &s;um from the crown when fir&s;t appoint|ed, together with the &s;ettlement of a yearly pen|&s;ion of four or five thou&s;and pounds, to commence when they are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this high &s;tation. The lord chancellor and the lord keeper are the &s;ame in authority, power, and precedence: yet there is a difference between them in the creation. The keeper is created by the king's delivering the great &s;eal into his hands, and his taking the oath; but the lord chancellor hath a patent be&s;ides. A
<PB N="200" REF="2070">
lord keeper is created only during the vacation of the chancellor&s;hip, to perform the functions of this office. The lord trea&s;urer was ve&s;ted with his of|fice by receiving a white &s;taff from the king, and held it <HI>durante bene placito regis;</HI> but &s;ince the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent royal family, the office hath been put in commi&s;&s;ion, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the revenue managed by commi&s;&s;ioners, called lords of the trea&s;ury. The fourth great officer of &s;tate is the lord pre&s;ident of the king's privy council, created by letters-patent under the great &s;eal, during his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure. He attends upon the king, to propo&s;e matters at the council table; and to re|port the tran&s;actions of the council to his maje&s;ty. Next to the pre&s;ident is the lord privy-&s;eal, a privy coun&s;ellor, <HI>ex officio,</HI> through who&s;e hands all charters, grants, and pardons &s;igned by the king, are pa&s;&s;ed before they are confirmed by the great &s;eal of England; he likewi&s;e &s;eals warrants for pen|&s;ions, and the payment of money in other matters, which do not require the confirmation of the great &s;eal. His &s;alary does not exceed fifteen hundred pounds a-year: but, in dignity, he is ranked among the chief per&s;onages of the realm. The lord chamber|lain of England is an officer of great power, and enjoys a great number of perqui&s;ites. He takes care to provide all things in the hou&s;e of lords in time of parliament; and to him belongs the go|vernment of the whole palace. He i&s;&s;ues warrants for preparing and furni&s;hing We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall for coronations and trials of peers; and the gentleman u&s;her of the black rod, with his deputies, are under the chamberlain's command. Upon all &s;olemn oc|ca&s;ions, the keys of We&s;tmin&s;ter hall, the court of Wards, and court of Reque&s;ts, are delivered to this officer. He is intitled to livery and lodging in the king's court, to certain fees from the pre|lates, when they do homage or fealty to the king,
<PB N="201" REF="2080">
as well as from all the peers of the realm, at their creation. At the ceremony of a coronation he re|ceives forty ells of crim&s;on velvet for his own robes, and after he hath apparelled the king for this oc|ca&s;ion, he takes for his fees, the bed and furni|ture of the bed chamber, together with all his maje&s;ty's night-apparel. He carries at the cere|mony the coat, gloves, and linnen, the &s;word and &s;cabbard, the gold to be offered by the king, with the robe royal and crown: he attires his maje&s;ty in the royal robes, and &s;erves him that day, be|fore and after dinner, with water, taking the ba&s;on and towel for his fees. The lord chamber|lain &s;uperintends all the officers of the king's hou&s;hold, above &s;tairs, except the precinct of the king's bed-chamber; as al&s;o all the officers of the wardrobe at all his maje&s;ty's hou&s;es, the &s;erjeants at arms, phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, apothecaries, and chaplains: all, or mo&s;t of the&s;e places, and many others, are in his gift, and he enjoys a &s;alary of twelve hundred pounds. The office of lord high con&s;table of England has been thought too powerful for any &s;ubject; and therefore dropped, except upon certain occa&s;ions, when a lord high con&s;table is created <HI>pro illa vice.</HI> He a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the coronation, pre&s;ided at all &s;olemn trials by combat, which are now di&s;u&s;ed, &s;hared the power and juri&s;diction of the earl-mar&s;hal, of whom he took place. The po&s;t of earl-mar&s;hal is a military office, like that of the con&s;table, and has been long hereditary in the hou&s;e of Norfolk. He took cognizance of all matters of war and arms, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the kings at arms and heralds, who &s;it in their proper habits, in the college of Heralds, which is called a court of chivalry. He mar&s;hals the cere|mony at the proclamation and coronation of kings, their marriages, funerals, interviews, and fe&s;ti|vals, &amp;c. He held the court of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, to
<PB N="202" REF="2090">
take cognizance of all offences committed within the verge of his maje&s;ty's palace: but now it is kept in the name of the lord &s;teward of the king's hou&s;hold; and his power, in other re&s;pects, is al|mo&s;t abrogated. The la&s;t great officer of the crown of England is the lord-high-admiral, com|mander in chief of the Briti&s;h navy, to whom was committed the whole government of the marine, ve&s;ted with a power to appoint &s;ea-officers, as well as commi&s;&s;ioners or judges for exerci&s;ing ju&s;tice in the court of admiralty: the office is now put into commi&s;&s;ion, and the commi&s;&s;ioners are &s;tiled lords of the admiralty. They take cognizance of every thing relating to the &s;ea, and to them is &s;ub&s;ervient the navy-board, victualling-office, and all the commi&s;&s;ioners of the dock-yards in England.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the great officers of &s;tate, are tho&s;e appointed for the civil government of the king's court. The chief of the&s;e is lord &s;teward of the king's hou&s;hold, who carries a white &s;taff in the king's pre&s;ence; attends his maje&s;ty's per&s;on; at the beginning of parliament admini&s;ters the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy to all the members of the hou&s;e of commons; adju&s;ts the parliamentary expences; and is ve&s;ted with authority over all the officers and &s;ervants of the king's hou&s;e, except tho&s;e belonging to the chapel, bedchamber, and &s;table. The next is the lord chamberlain, who&s;e office both in the &s;tate and in the hou&s;hold we have already explained. The third great officer of the king's court, is the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, antiently known by the name of <HI>comes &s;tabuli,</HI> or con&s;table. He &s;uperintends the king's &s;table and &s;tuds; takes charge of all the revenues and lands appropriated for the maintenance of the king's hor&s;es; exerci&s;es authority over all equerries and pages, footmen, grooms, farriers, and all &s;ervants and trade&s;men belonging to the king's &s;tables; at any &s;olemn ca|valcade,
<PB N="203" REF="2100">
he rides behind the king, leading a led hor&s;e of &s;tate, and generally accompanies his ma|je&s;ty in the coach of &s;tate, when he goes to the up|per hou&s;e of parliament. All the &s;ervants of his maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold are &s;ubordinate to the&s;e three principal officers.</P>
<P>The civil government of England is regulated, and every new mea&s;ure of the admini&s;tration, pro|po&s;ed and planned in the privy-council, con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e noblemen and others, whom the king plea&s;es to choo&s;e for their rank and fortune, wi&s;|dom, knowledge, and integrity, in order to con|&s;ult and deliberate with them, upon all affairs of con&s;equence relating to the government: they like|wi&s;e &s;it as a court of judicature, to determine ap|peals from Ireland and the plantations. They con|tinue in this honourable office during the king's plea&s;ure: when &s;ummoned, they attend his ma|je&s;ty at council-board, and &s;it in their order bare-headed, when the king pre&s;ides. At all debates, the lowe&s;t delivers his opinion fir&s;t; and the &s;ove|reign at la&s;t, by declaring his judgment, determines the matter of debate. A privy-coun&s;ellor, though a gentleman only, takes precedence of all knights and younger &s;ons of barons, and his per&s;on is held &s;a|cred. He takes an oath to advi&s;e the king truly, ju&s;tly, and evenly, to the be&s;t of his power and di&s;|cretion, and to keep &s;ecret his maje&s;ty's coun&s;el.</P>
<P>A council is &s;eldom or never held, except when one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate is pre&s;ent. The&s;e two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a third &s;ecretary lately appointed for the affairs of the colonies.</NOTE> officers, &s;tiled principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, are in effect the prime mini&s;ters of England. They pre&s;ent petitions and reque&s;ts to the crown, and make di&s;patches according to his maje&s;ty's an&s;wers and directions. They manage a corre&s;|pondence with all parts of the Briti&s;h dominions,
<PB N="204" REF="2110">
in order to carry on the admini&s;tration of the inte|rior government. They di&s;patch in&s;tructions to amba&s;&s;adors re&s;ident in foreign countries, as well as to generals employed in expeditions abroad; and all the returns of negociations and intelligence are made to the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, one of whom is ge|nerally the per&s;on cho&s;en by the king to manage and direct the machine of government. With re|&s;pect to the bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted, each has his own &s;eparate office and department: with re&s;pect to their appointments, each &s;ecretary enjoys a &s;alary of two thou&s;and pounds, together with board wages, and lodgings in the king's palace, for the accommodation of him and his attendants.</P>
<P>Every regulation, with re&s;pect to the army, is managed by the &s;ecretary at war, who is an officer of great tru&s;t, enjoys con&s;iderable appointments, and keeps his office at Whitehall. Independent of this, however, are the board of ordnance, and the office of payma&s;ter-general, who receives and i&s;&s;ues money for the payment of the &s;orces.</P>
<P>All commercial matters, together with matters relating to the improvement of the colonies, are examined and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at the board of trade, con|&s;i&s;ting of lords commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and planta|tions, appointed by the king. There are, be&s;ides, a variety of inferior boards, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the ma|nagement of the revenue and other articles of na|tional oeconomy, of which we cannot pretend to give a minute detail: &s;uch are the po&s;t-office, ex|ci&s;e, cu&s;toms, and &s;tamp-offices.</P>

<P>The nobility of England are numerous and wealthy; and enjoy many honourable privileges: but they po&s;&s;e&s;s no power which could be incom|patible with the rights and liberties of their fellow|&s;ubjects. The majority of them live with great
<PB N="205" REF="2120">
magnificence, e&s;pecially at their country-&s;eats, which are indeed elegant palaces, adorned with fine gardens, ponds, parks, and plantations. No country in Chri&s;tendom can produce &s;uch a number of noblemen living in all the pomp of affluence, and all the joy of independence, &s;ecured by the law from the arm of arbitrary power, and, in their turn, di&s;abled by the law from exerci&s;ing the rod of oppre&s;&s;ion. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the dif|ferent titles of duke, marquis, earl, vi&s;count, and baron; and, according to the&s;e degrees, take prece|dency of one another: but they are all equally peers of England, created by patent, and as barons &s;it in the hou&s;e of lords, which is the &s;upreme court of judicature in the kingdom. Some of the pri|vileges of the peers it may not be ami&s;s to &s;pecify. A peer is the king's hereditary coun&s;ellor; his per|&s;on is &s;acred from arre&s;t, except in ca&s;e of trea&s;on, felony, breach of the peace, condemnation in par|liament, or contempt of the king. In the&s;e ca&s;es he cannot be tried but by a jury of peers: he cannot be impanneled on any jury of inque&s;t: he cannot be bound to his good behaviour, nor obliged to &s;wear in a court of ju&s;tice; but only to declare up|on his honour. In ca&s;e of lawful ab&s;ence, he can con&s;titute a proxy to vote for him in parlia|ment; a privilege which no commoner enjoys. He is exempted from all attendance at &s;heriff's turns and leets, where other &s;ubjects are obliged to take the oath of allegiance; as al&s;o from joining the <HI>po&s;&s;e comitatus,</HI> when it is rai&s;ed by the &s;heriff to &s;up|pre&s;s routs and riots. He cannot be outlawed in any civil action, nor pre&s;&s;ed to death as a commoner, when mute upon his trial; and when condemned to die, he is indulged with the honour of decapi|tation. The hou&s;e of a peer, in ca&s;e of a &s;earch for prohibited books, cannot be entered by the of|ficers of ju&s;tice, without a warrant under the king's
<PB N="206" REF="2130">
own hand, &s;igned by &s;ix members of the privy|council, four of whom mu&s;t be peers of the realm. A peer cannot be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed towards a &s;tanding mi|litia, but by &s;ix more of his own quality. He has the privilege of qualifying a certain number of chaplains, who, after a di&s;pen&s;ation from the arch|bi&s;hop, ratified under the great &s;eal of England, may hold plurality of benefices within &s;uch a di&s;|tance, with cure of &s;ouls: finally, his character is peculiarly guarded from &s;lander and abu&s;e, by a &s;tatute called <HI>&s;candalum magnatum.</HI> The &s;ons of nobility enjoy certain titles by curte&s;y, according to the rank of their fathers; but the law ranks them among the commons of England. Thus the elde&s;t &s;on of a duke is denominated marquis or earl, and the younger &s;ons are &s;aluted by the ap|pellation of my lord. The fir&s;t &s;on of a marquis or earl is denominated lord of &s;ome barony be|longing to his father; and his brothers are like|wi&s;e addre&s;&s;ed by the title of lord <HI>John,</HI> or lord <HI>William:</HI> the &s;i&s;ters enjoy the honourable title of <HI>lady</HI> in the &s;ame manner. But this courte&s;y is not extended to the younger children of vi&s;counts and baronets.</P>

<HEAD>KNIGHTS, ESQUIRES, and YEOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>The next cla&s;s or order of per&s;ons, after the ba|rons, are the baronets of England, &s;o called as an inferior kind of barons, in Latin <HI>baronuli, barun|culi,</HI> and <HI>baronetti,</HI> con&s;tituted in the room of the old vava&s;ours, to hold a middle place between the parliamentary barons and the different orders of knights. They were created by James I. who be|&s;towed this hereditary honour as an encouragement to tho&s;e of his &s;ubjects who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the reduction of the province of Ul&s;ter in Ireland. No per&s;on could be admitted into this order, unle&s;s he was a
<PB N="207" REF="2140">
gentleman by blood, of unblemi&s;hed morals, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a yearly revenue of one thou&s;and pounds in lands, and the expre&s;s condition of his admi&s;&s;ion was, that he &s;hould maintain thirty &s;oldiers for three years, on the military e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ire|land. As an armorial badge of di&s;tinction, he wears in a canton of his e&s;cutcheon, a bloody hand, as the arms of Ul&s;ter. The number of baronets was at fir&s;t re&s;tricted to two hundred; but now it is inlarged without limitation. The title of baronet is conferred by patent under the great &s;eal, and de|&s;cends to heirs male: like other knights, he is di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the appellative <HI>Sir</HI> prefixed to his chri&s;tian name, in &s;peaking and writing. He takes precedence of all other knights, except tho&s;e of the Garter, and bannerets created in the field of battle. He is intitled to an honourable place in the king's army, near the royal &s;tandard; and his elde&s;t &s;on, by virtue of a peculiar privilege, when of age, has a right to the honour of knighthood whenever it &s;hall be demanded. The wives of ba|ronets are ladies, and take place before the wives of all knights what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of baronets, there are three orders of knighthood in Great Britain, namely, tho&s;e of the <HI>Gar er,</HI> the <HI>Thi&s;tle,</HI> and the <HI>Bath.</HI> The order of St. George, or the Garter, is one of the mo&s;t antient and honourable in&s;titutions of lay knights, now ex|tant. It was founded by king Edward III. that warlike monarch, who held the kings of France and Scotland pri&s;oners at one time in England. The order of the Garter is a college or corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;overeign and twenty-five com|panions, called knights of the Garter; of a dean, canons, petit canons, vergers, and other inferior officers, and of twenty-&s;ix poor knights, who re|ceive their maintenance from the college as a re|ward for military &s;ervice, and in con&s;ideration of
<PB N="208" REF="2150">
the prayers they put up for the &s;overeign and the twenty-five companions. The intention of this charity, however, is now perverted; and this al|lowance be&s;towed upon &s;uperannuated butlers and &s;erving-men. There are other officers belonging to the order of the Garter, which is dedicated to St. George, the tutelar &s;aint and patron of England; &s;uch as that of prelate of the Garter, annexed to the bi&s;hopric of Winche&s;ter; the chancellor&s;hip, ve&s;ted in the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury; and the regi&s;try, be|longing to the dean of Wind&s;or. There is a prin|cipal king at arms called Garter, who&s;e province it is to mar&s;hal the &s;olemnities at fea&s;ts and in&s;talla|tions: finally, the u&s;her of the black rod, is like|wi&s;e u&s;her of the Garter. The &s;eat of the order is in the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, con&s;i&s;ting of the chapter|hou&s;e, the hall, and chapel of St. George. A knight of this order is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a blue gar|ter with a gold buckle, worn on the left leg, and in&s;cribed <HI>honi &s;oil qui mal y pen&s;e;</HI> &s;ignifying, <HI>&s;hame to him who puts a bad con&s;truction on this order;</HI> by an embroidered &s;ilver &s;tar on the left brea&s;t; and the picture of St. George, enamelled upon gold, and be&s;et with diamonds, hanging at the end of a broad blue ribbon, that cro&s;&s;es the body from the left &s;houlder. The greate&s;t monarchs of Chri&s;ten|dom have been members of this in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The order of the Bath was fir&s;t in&s;tituted by king Henry IV. and took their denomination from bath|ing on the eve of their admi&s;&s;ion. The order, which had grown ob&s;olete, was revived by king George the Fir&s;t, in the year 1725, when eighteen noblemen and as many commoners were in&s;talled knights of the Bath with great ceremony at We&s;t|min&s;ter. Their number is limited to forty-&s;ix; and they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;tar on the brea&s;t, and a broad red ribbon worn like a belt over the &s;houlder.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="2160">
The order of the Thi&s;tle we have already de|&s;cribed as a Scotti&s;h in&s;titution. Knights bannerets, or <HI>equites vexilliferi,</HI> never made but in the field of battle: there are none in England. Knights ba|chelors, or <HI>equites aurati,</HI> &s;o called from their gilt &s;purs, were antiently gentlemen who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their valour, and the honour was in very high e&s;teem; but the original in&s;titution be|ing perverted, it is now conferred indi&s;criminately upon gown&s;men, burghers, and phy&s;icians, by the king's lightly touching them on the right &s;houlder with a drawn &s;word: accordingly, the title has lo&s;t much of its former dignity.</P>
<P>All the gentlemen of England, not di&s;tingui&s;hed by nobility or knighthood, are comprehended un|der the general denomination of e&s;quires, or <HI>armi|geri,</HI> the title formerly given to tho&s;e among the gentry who acted as armour-bearers in war, to the prince and prime nobility. Though the right of this title is limited to per&s;ons of a certain rank, &s;uch as the &s;ons of barons, and gentlemen who&s;e ance&s;|tors have been always free and borne a coat of arms; mayors of towns, coun&s;ellors at law, bachelors of divinity, law, or phy&s;ic; yet it is indi&s;criminately given to all tho&s;e who maintain the appearance of gentlemen.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t order of plebeians are the freeholders, called yeomen, from the Saxon word <HI>gemani,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>common.</HI> The&s;e are the hu&s;bandmen and farmers, who hold lands and tenements inheritable by a perpetual right to them and their heirs for ever. They are numerous and wealthy, and when their &s;ub&s;tance increa&s;es to a certain proportion, they may whenever they plea&s;e a&s;cend into the rank of gentlemen. Be&s;ides the&s;e freeholders, there is a great number of copyholders, who po&s;&s;e&s;s lands within certain manours, by copy of court-roll be|longing to the&s;e manours. They enjoy <HI>jus perpe|tuum</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="2170">
and <HI>utile dominium,</HI> though not <HI>allodium</HI> and <HI>directum dominium;</HI> indeed, this la&s;t is ve&s;ted in no per&s;on but the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The next cla&s;s of the people are merchants and traders, greatly and de&s;ervedly re&s;pected in Eng|land, on account of their riches as well as their profe&s;&s;ion, which contributes &s;o much to the wealth and power of the nation. The bu&s;ine&s;s of a mer|chant is accounted &s;o honourable in England, that the younger &s;ons of the be&s;t families engage in commerce. Inferior to this degree is that of the trade&s;men, including &s;hopkeepers and handicraft&s;|man; and the lowe&s;t members of the community, are the hired &s;ervants and day-labourers, who &s;ub|&s;i&s;t by the daily wages they receive from their em|ployers.</P>

<HEAD>CUSTOMS re&s;pecting the WOMEN and CHILDREN in ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>A woman in England, as &s;oon as married, is with all her moveables, at the will and di&s;po&s;ition of her hu&s;band; nor can &s;he alienate any thing without his con&s;ent: her nece&s;&s;ary apparel is not her own property; and if &s;he has any tenure, &s;he holds it in <HI>capite,</HI> that is, of and by her hu&s;band, who is deemed the head or <HI>caput mulieris;</HI> nay, at the death of the hu&s;band, all the per&s;onal chattels &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;ed at marriage, de&s;cend to his executor or admini&s;trator. She can make no contract without her hu&s;band's con&s;ent, nor reply without him, in matters of law. On the other hand, he mu&s;t pay the debts which &s;he has contracted; and if &s;he &s;hould injure any per&s;on by her tongue or tre&s;pa&s;s, he will be obliged to make &s;atisfaction. The wife enjoys many other privileges, which are not granted to them in other countries. She cannot be arre&s;ted for debt during the life of her hu&s;band. If &s;he is
<PB N="211" REF="2180">
delivered of a child, though her hu&s;band has been ab&s;ent from her &s;everal years; yet if he re&s;ided <HI>in|ter quatuor maria,</HI> that is, within the i&s;land of Great Britain, he is obliged to father the child, which will &s;ucceed to his e&s;tate as if lawfully be|gotten. If &s;he brings forth a child begotten before marriage, by a former hu&s;band, or any other per|&s;on, this child being born after the la&s;t marriage, becomes the heir at law to the hu&s;band, though he is not the natural father. The wife, having no jointure &s;ettled upon her before marriage, may, at her hu&s;band's death, challenge the third part of his yearly rents in land, for her life. Women are en|nobled by de&s;cent as well as by creation. They are, in the eye of the law, peers of the realm, tried as &s;uch by their peers, and though they do not &s;it in parliament, enjoy all the privileges attached to the male nobility. Noble women married to plebeians, retain their nobility; and all women married to peers, are ennobled by their marriage: but the wife's dignity cannot, like her goods and chattels, be conveyed to the hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The authority of fathers is &s;o ab&s;olute in Eng|land, that they may give away their unentailed e&s;|tates from their own children, or bequeath their fortunes to any one child, in preference to all the re&s;t. A youth of fourteen may choo&s;e his guardian, and con&s;ent to marriage; at twenty-one he is at age to make any contract, deed, or will, and to &s;it in parliament. A girl at twelve is capable of giv|ing her con&s;ent to matrimony, and that con&s;ent &s;hall be binding: at the age of twenty-one, &s;he may contract or alienate her lands by will or other|wi&s;e. The elde&s;t &s;on commonly inherits the landed e&s;tate, and the younger children are portioned from the goods and chattels; but in Kent and &s;ome other places, the lands are by the cu&s;tom of Gavel Kind, equally divided among all the &s;ons. In
<PB N="212" REF="2190">
&s;ome manours, the younge&s;t &s;on inherits all the lands by a cu&s;tom called Burrough Engli&s;h. If there are no &s;ons, the e&s;tate is equally divided among the daughters; yet, in certain manours, &s;uch as that of Bray, in Berk&s;hire, the elde&s;t daughter &s;ucceeds, like the elde&s;t &s;on, to the whole inheritance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE, their PERSONS, ATTIRE, DISPOSITION, and MANNERS.</HEAD>
<P>The people of England are generally well &s;ized, well &s;haped, with good features regularly di&s;po&s;ed, fair, &s;mooth &s;kins, and florid complexions. Their eyes and hair commonly vary from a jet black, to a light che&s;nut colour; light eyes and hair &s;eldom occur, except among the Iri&s;h and Scots who &s;ettle in England, and their de&s;cendants. The defect that mo&s;t commonly appears in the per&s;ons of the Engli&s;h is the decayed &s;tate of their teeth, corrupted by the &s;curvy, which is endemial in this country. In other re&s;pects, the men are the mo&s;t comely, and the women the mo&s;t beautiful, that any kingdom of Europe can produce. The attire worn by fa&s;hionable people of both &s;exes is copied, like all other articles of luxury, from the French. The gentlemen appear in flowered and plain velvets, embroidery, and orrice: the ladies are arrayed in the mo&s;t co&s;tly brocades, &s;attin, and &s;ilks, adorned with the fine&s;t laces, and glittering with a profu&s;ion of diamonds. The clergyman is di&s;tingui&s;hed by his gown and ca&s;&s;ock, or a frock of dark grey cloth with plain linnen. The phy&s;ician may be known by his formal air, his large tye-periwig, and &s;word cro&s;&s;ing his po&s;teriors almo&s;t at right angles. The &s;port&s;man affects the riding dre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of a light frock with metal buttons, a laced hat and &s;hort bob wig, &s;hort jockey boots and buck&s;kin
<PB N="213" REF="2200">
breeches. The man of bu&s;ine&s;s commonly wears a plain &s;uit of &s;uperfine cloth with excellent linnen: the quaker is always over&s;hadowed with a broad brimmed beaver uncocked, which he will not move upon any ceremony or occa&s;ion what&s;oever. The trade&s;men, farmers, and labourers, are decently apparrelled. In a word, the people of England, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, are remarkably neat in their attire, and even the beggars are better clad, than the mendicants of any other country; nay, it mu&s;t be owned that in point of cleanline&s;s, the Engli&s;h excel all the nations in Europe.</P>
<P>The manners of the Engli&s;h people vary in the different cla&s;&s;es of which they are compo&s;ed, ac|cording to the difference of education and inter|cour&s;e. Per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, after having &s;tudied at the univer&s;ity, commonly travel for improve|ment. They are magnificent in their dre&s;s, equi|page, dwelling, and manner of living; generally polite, ho&s;pitable, good-natured, and charitable; but not very remarkable for their liberality to the profe&s;&s;ors of the poli&s;hed arts, even to tho&s;e who have exhibited proofs of excellence and ingenuity. On the rever&s;e of their character, we likewi&s;e ob|&s;erve a di&s;po&s;ition to gaming, riot, and exce&s;&s;ive in&s;olence of pride, and a &s;trong propen&s;ity to con|temptuous ridicule, diffu&s;ed through the whole na|tion, from the highe&s;t peer to the lowe&s;t chimney|&s;weeper. Perhaps this is the genuine characteri&s;tic of the Engli&s;h people: for it &s;trikes every fo|reigner at his fir&s;t arrival in England, and appears remarkably con&s;picuous in the writings of the Eng|li&s;h authors. This contempt &s;eems to ari&s;e from a compari&s;on of their own affluence with the poverty of their neighbours; and were we allowed to fix the natural criterion of the Engli&s;h character, we &s;hould call it <HI>bluntne&s;s:</HI> a di&s;po&s;ition, which when in&s;pired by &s;entiment and education, produces an
<PB N="214" REF="2210">
a&s;toni&s;hing contempt of danger, and an admirable &s;pirit of independence. Among the people of the middle rank, it makes its appearance in a di&s;a|greeable indifference, or more di&s;agreeable free|doms, and, with the vulgar, it often degenerates into meer brutality. An Engli&s;hman, unrefined by travel and communication, numbers among his privileges the right of &s;peaking his &s;entiments on all occa&s;ions without re&s;erve, even when incon|&s;i&s;tent with the univer&s;al rules of good breeding and humanity: hence tho&s;e &s;hocking reflections and reproaches, national and per&s;onal, which have often been productive of quarrels and homicide. An Engli&s;hman, however, is not naturally cruel, but rather mild and compa&s;&s;ionate, and though extremely ira&s;cible, ea&s;ily appea&s;ed by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He is neither tenacious of re&s;entment, nor ad|dicted to revenge; but compromi&s;es differences, and forgets injuries, ea&s;ier and &s;ooner than the natives of &s;ome other countries could well ima|gine. The rich open their pur&s;es freely to objects in di&s;tre&s;s, in&s;omuch that no people in the world (the proportion of their numbers being con&s;idered) contribute half as much as is collected in Eng|land for the relief of the poor; indeed, no other nation is &s;o able to exert its charity; nor has any other people occa&s;ion to exert it &s;o much: for the &s;ums thus collected, are &s;quandered away without oeconomy, or proper regulation: &s;o that the in|tention of the donors is defeated, and every corner of England &s;warms with vagabonds and beggars, although three millions &s;terling are &s;aid to be given annually for the maintenance of the poor. The Engli&s;h are naturally hone&s;t and un&s;u&s;pecting, con&s;equently liable to impo&s;ition. This general confidence in mankind, added to a redundancy of wealth, and a mercantile di&s;po&s;ition, renders them very liberal of their pur&s;es and their credit, to
<PB N="215" REF="2220">
tho&s;e who can amu&s;e them with plau&s;ible &s;chemes of turning their money to good account. The Engli&s;h merchants are, beyond all others, famous for their honourable dealings, as well as for their knowledge of trade and their exten&s;ive commerce. The people, in general, are ma&s;ters of the diffe|rent profe&s;&s;ions they exerci&s;e; their workman&s;hip is neatly and elegantly fini&s;hed, far above any thing of the &s;ame &s;ort in other countries; and though they are not very remarkable for their di&s;|coveries in the arts of handicraft&s;men, they never fail to make improvements on the inventions of their neighbours. The Engli&s;h are clear of ap|prehen&s;ion, capable of inten&s;e application, and can pur&s;ue one point with per&s;everance, undi&s;turbed by a variety or competition of ideas. Their con|ver&s;ation is extremely irregular, though u&s;ually &s;en&s;ible; &s;ometimes dull and phlegmatic; &s;ome|times &s;olid, ingenious, and argumentative; &s;ome|times &s;prightly, replete with wit and humour. Such variation will always be found in a people like the Engli&s;h, endued with &s;en&s;ibility, who&s;e &s;pirits are affected by the &s;udden changes of an ir|regular climate: for the &s;ame rea&s;on, they will be as variable in their tempers, whim&s;ical, capricious, and incon&s;tant. The Engli&s;h have been always equally famed for courage and ingenuity. Their &s;oldiers are fearle&s;s in the day of battle, and have obtained a great number of &s;ignal victories, over the mo&s;t powerful and warlike nations on the con|tinent; and their &s;ailors are confe&s;&s;edly &s;uperior to all the mariners upon earth, in activity, &s;kill, and intrepidity. The whim&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e i&s;landers appears in very &s;trange &s;ingulari|ties; all of which, however, &s;eem to countenance and encourage an univer&s;al levelling principle in favour of indu&s;try and commerce. A nobleman of the fir&s;t quality and fortune may be &s;een in the
<PB N="216" REF="2230">
character and garb of a coachman, mounted upon the box, and driving his own carriage; nay, &s;ome of them have been known to drive the com|mon &s;tage vehicle, that conveys pa&s;&s;engers from one place to another. The lord mayor of Lon|don has been mi&s;taken for one of his own porters; and nothing is more common than to &s;ee a man worth fifty thou&s;and pounds, dining for a &s;hilling in a common cook's &s;hop. There is a great num|ber of originals, who&s;e &s;ingularities break out in every occurrence of life; in their dre&s;s and addre&s;s, their way of living, their clubs, &s;ocieties, court&s;hips, marriages, wills, legacies, funerals, letters, writings, and adverti&s;ements. A nobleman thinks it no di&s;|paragement to match with the lowe&s;t of the people, nor does the public revolt at the alliance, provided it be cemented with a large &s;um of money: per&s;ons of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion have been known to marry Jews for wealth, and pro&s;titutes for affection, without in|curring the lea&s;t cen&s;ure or di&s;grace; and indeed every man is re&s;pected in proportion to the riches he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth, without the lea&s;t re&s;pect or retro&s;pect to birth or &s;tation. It is not at all unu&s;ual to &s;ee the hu&s;band, in his apron and &s;leeves, &s;elling half a pound of dried figs below, while his wife keeps rout above, with all the &s;tate of a counte&s;s. An Engli&s;hman, in bu&s;ine&s;s, is le&s;s liable than any other to be affected by a change of fortune. The &s;hopkeeper, even after he has accumulated an opulent fortune, proceeds in his calling, and con|tinues to wor&s;hip his poore&s;t cu&s;tomer with the mo&s;t ob&s;equious addre&s;s. On the other hand, the merchant, who had lived in affluence, when ruined by lo&s;&s;es in trade, and &s;tripped of his all by a &s;tatute of bankruptcy, humbles his mind to his circum&s;tances, begins the world anew with re|doubled ardour, and now bows, in his turn, to tho&s;e of whom he exacted obei&s;ance before.</P>

<HEAD>AMUSEMENTS and DIVERSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The diver&s;ions and pa&s;times of the Engli&s;h peo|ple may be divided into tho&s;e of the town, and tho&s;e of the country; and again &s;ubdivided into &s;uch as are peculiar to the higher ranks of life, &s;uch as are practi&s;ed by the lower cla&s;s of people, and &s;uch as are common to both. The diver&s;ions of the town are operas, ridottos, ma&s;querades, concerts of mu&s;ic, and card a&s;&s;emblies, for per&s;ons of fa&s;hion. The pa&s;times of the country, peculiar to the &s;ame degree, are hor&s;e-races, &s;tag, fox, and hare hunting. A modern hor&s;e-race is the rendez|vous of common &s;harpers, who, in de&s;pite of in|famy, have found means to mingle with the qua|lity, and fleece them openly, by dint of con&s;pira|cies and fraudulent wagers. A &s;pirit of gaming runs riot with &s;uch violence at a hor&s;e-race, that one would imagine all the &s;pectators were actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Hunting is the &s;port of country gen|tlemen; and tho&s;e whom the world di&s;tingui&s;h by the appellation of fox-hunters can attend to no other avocation. They &s;eem to be infatuated with the diver&s;ion. Their whole lives are &s;pent in fol|lowing the hounds, riding, leaping, and hollow|ing, as if they were mad, and after the chace, in carou&s;ing and riot; &s;o that they are become as &s;avage as the bea&s;ts they pur&s;ue. The common people have likewi&s;e their town and country pa&s;times, which they enjoy with great eagerne&s;s. Among the&s;e we number cock-fighting, cudgel|ing, wre&s;tling, duck-hunting, bowls, &s;kittles, or nine-pins, archery, pri&s;on-bars, cricket, &s;hovel|board, quoits, divers games of chance, and &s;pec|tacles of various kinds, &s;uch as tumbling, bal|lancing, vaulting, feats of legerdemain, bear and bull baiting, a&s;s races, collections of wild

bea&s;ts, mu&s;ic, dancing, drolls, puppet-&s;hews, and ringing bells, a Gothic diver&s;ion, which cannot be enjoyed without di&s;turbing &s;everal pari&s;hes. But the mo&s;t remarkable articles of vulgar entertain|ment; which are now prohibited by the legi&s;lature, were boxing and prize fighting, two diver&s;ions which; among other nations, intailed the reproach of barbarity upon the Engli&s;h people. Nothing was more common than to &s;ee the prize-fighters wound each other with &s;words, until one was maimed, and the plea&s;ure of the audience ro&s;e in proportion to the quantity of blood that flowed upon the &s;tage. With re&s;pect to boxing, the &s;pectators never expre&s;&s;ed that &s;atisfaction &s;o warm|ly, as when they &s;aw one of the parties left &s;peech|le&s;s, in&s;en&s;ible, covered with gore, and &s;o disfi|gured, that a human feature could not be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in his countenance. This entertainment, though properly a vulgar pa&s;time, was often honoured with the pre&s;ence of per&s;ons in the fir&s;t rank of life: but, as it was always the re&s;ort of thieves and pick-pockets, the parliament &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed it, together with &s;ome other places of re|creation, which engro&s;&s;ed the time, and debauch|ed the morals of the common people. There are other amu&s;ements both of town and country pur|&s;ued in common by people of all ranks, &s;uch as &s;tage plays, mu&s;ick meetings, tennis, fives, bil|liards, cards, riding, &s;ailing, rowing, &s;wimming, angling, fowling, and cour&s;ing. But the mo&s;t con&s;tant and &s;olid enjoyment upon which the Eng|li&s;h value them&s;elves in a peculiar manner, is good cheer in their clubs and fe&s;tal meetings, where they eat great quantities of fle&s;h-meat, drink large|ly of fermented liquors, and &s;moak plentifully of tobacco.</P>

<HEAD>HABITATIONS, and Manner of LIVING.</HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;es, belonging to per&s;ons of fa&s;hion and fortune, are built of &s;tone, large, magnificent, and well provided with offices. The apartments are &s;pacious, adorned with carvings and paintings, and the furniture rich and &s;plendid. The mid|dling &s;ort of people live in brick hou&s;es, roomy, convenient, well fini&s;hed, and neatly furni&s;hed; every hou&s;e-keeper occupying an entire tenement, detached from his neighbours, and having all ne|ce&s;&s;ary conveniencies within him&s;elf. The habi|tations of the lower cla&s;s are built of the &s;ame ma|terials, though not &s;o large and well fini&s;hed; and, perhaps, &s;everal families are crowded into one hou&s;e. The hou&s;e-keeping of fa&s;hionable people is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a great number of &s;ervants, gay liveries, and equipages, a va&s;t quantity of plate, a &s;umptuous table covered with a profu&s;ion of di&s;hes and dainties, and a great variety of the be&s;t fla|voured wines that France can afford. Tho&s;e who maintain the middle rank, including many indi|viduals of opulent fortunes, differ very little in their hou&s;e-keeping from common trade&s;men, ex|cept perhaps in a greater &s;hew of plate, and in a more genteel appearance of &s;ervants. A man who&s;e yearly income may amount to five hundred pounds, and a merchant worth forty or fifty thou|&s;and in effects, u&s;ually dines with his family on a joint of meat and a pudding, and drinks a few gla&s;&s;es of wine after his meal. All the people of England, except tho&s;e that live by con&s;tant la|bour, breakfa&s;t upon tea and bread and butter. Tea-drinking is generally repeated in the after|noon; an article of luxury which hath de&s;cended even to cook-maids and wa&s;her-women: indeed, all dome&s;tic &s;ervants in England eat the very
<PB N="220" REF="2270">
&s;ame food, and drink the &s;ame liquor, that nou|ri&s;hes their ma&s;ters. In all cities, towns, and cor|porations, the men commonly &s;pend their even|ing at the tavern or public hou&s;e. The butcher's meat, throughout England, con&s;i&s;ting of beef, veal, mutton, lamb, pork, and pig, is good in its kind, and generally more e&s;teemed for its fat than its flavour. The ordinary cookery is con|fined to &s;imple roa&s;ting, boiling, broiling, and frying; and the&s;e culinary operations are half per|formed: for an Engli&s;hman would rather eat his meat raw, than run any ri&s;k of lo&s;ing the juices by evaporation. Though the rivers and &s;eas abound with fi&s;h, it is &s;eldom u&s;ed by the com|monalty, in compari&s;on of fle&s;h meat, which is the univer&s;al food of all ranks. Even the lowe&s;t labourer thinks he has dined ill, unle&s;s he hath eaten a &s;lice of delicious beef or mutton. With their fle&s;h-meat the Engli&s;h eat plenty of greens, &s;teeped in melted butter, which is their general &s;auce to all the common eatables, whether vege|table or animal. Their butter, it mu&s;t be owned, is delicate, their chee&s;e rich and palatable, their bread light, white, &s;weet, and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, except in the metropolis, where the flour is adul|terated by knavi&s;h bakers. Of liquors there is a great variety in England, imported from abroad, as well as manufactured in the country. The beer and ale home brewed, is generally plea&s;ing to the eye, delightful to the palate, and, if not drank to exce&s;s, agreeable to the con&s;titution. The duty on French wines is &s;o high, that per&s;ons of fortune only can afford to drink them; nor are they much reli&s;hed by the generality of the Engli&s;h people. To the product of France they prefer the wines of Spain and Portugal, which have the &s;tronger body, though they are endued with le&s;s flavour. Even the&s;e are &s;o &s;ophi&s;ticated by the vintners and pub|licans,
<PB N="221" REF="2280">
that there is little or no genuine wine &s;old by retail in the kingdom. The liquor generally drank by the middle cla&s;s of people is called punch, a compo&s;ition of water, lemon, or orange juice, &s;ugar, and the &s;pirit called rum, di&s;tilled from the refu&s;e of the &s;ugar canes in the Briti&s;h plantations: but this is al&s;o &s;hamefully adulterated with a mix|ture of Engli&s;h &s;pirit drawn from corn. Punch is likewi&s;e made with brandy from France, and ar|rack from the Ea&s;t Indies. Over and above the ale and beer made in England, the country pro|duces great quantities of excellent cyder and perry, extracted from apples and pears; mum, mead, and wine, made from rai&s;ins. Hard-working people delight in a kind of &s;trong beer called por|ter, brown, clear, bitter, and whole&s;ome; and the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t profligate cla&s;s of the vulgar, intoxicate them&s;elves with the fiery &s;pirit of ge|nevre. There are be&s;ides a great many different cordials made with brandy or Engli&s;h &s;pirit, di&s;til|led from a variety of ingredients. The practice of drinking is &s;o univer&s;al in England, that an incre|dible &s;um is yearly rai&s;ed by the exci&s;e upon li|quors con&s;umed throughout the kingdom. If one may be allowed to judge from the number of clubs, fraternities, and a&s;&s;ociations, that exi&s;t in this kingdom, the Engli&s;h are the mo&s;t &s;ociable peo|ple on the face of the earth. There is hardly a town, &s;treet, village, or neighbourhood, in South Britain, without a club or &s;ociety, regulated by its own peculiar laws, and con&s;i&s;ting of a pre&s;ident and members, who meet at &s;tated times, either for the purpo&s;es of good fellow&s;hip, or el&s;e to con|cert mea&s;ures for their mutual &s;ecurity and ad|vantage; at the&s;e conventions, they talk freely on all &s;ubjects, and not only acquire a &s;mattering of politicks and philo&s;ophy, but al&s;o learn to &s;peak in public without ba&s;hfulne&s;s or he&s;itation.

<P>Di&s;tempers ari&s;ing from intemperance are ri&s;e in England, e&s;pecially in the great towns; fevers of all kinds, continual, remitting, and intermitting, inflammation, malignant, and eruptive; pleuri|&s;ies, perepneumonies; coughs, catarrhs, diarrhoeas, dy&s;enteries, and con&s;umptions; gout, gravel, drop&s;y, jaundice, and the lues venerea. But the endemial di&s;ea&s;es of this climate, are the &s;curvy, the hypochondriacy, madne&s;s; and among the fair &s;ex, hy&s;terics, and the fluor albus. All the&s;e &s;eem to proceed either from a di&s;ordered per&s;pira|tion, occa&s;ioned by the mutability of the climate, and a relaxed habit, owing partly to the nature of the air, which is moi&s;t and frowzy, partly to a &s;edentary life, and partly to the immoderate prac|tice of tea-drinking: not but that the &s;curvy, and the other di&s;tempers we have mentioned, as inci|dent to the people of this country, may owe their origin, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to gro&s;s animal food and indige&s;tion; and &s;ometimes, they are tran&s;mitted by hereditary de&s;cent.

<HEAD>STATE of LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The Engli&s;h univer&s;ities of Oxford and Cam|bridge are &s;eminaries renowned all over Europe, for the learning and piety of their con&s;tituents, and the great men they have produced in the world of genius and literature, in&s;omuch, that a degree conferred by either is, in foreign countries, count|ed more honourable than the &s;ame degree obtained in any univer&s;ity of Chri&s;tendom. The liberal foundations of the re&s;pective colleges that compo&s;e the&s;e &s;eminaries, have encouraged men of extraor|dinary merit to embrace the academical life: the excellency of the in&s;titution, the wi&s;e regulations, the energy of the laws, and the vigour with which they are put in execution, within the precincts of the&s;e univer&s;ities, have had &s;uch happy effects, that the utmo&s;t decorum is pre&s;erved in every college; and while the &s;tudent's mind is improved with know|ledge, his morals are, as far as human wi&s;dom will admit, carefully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly guarded and pre&s;erved from &s;nares and corruptions.</P>
<P>Learning of all kinds is more generally diffu&s;ed in Great Britain, than in any other country we know. The clergy are famous for their profound knowledge in theological points and divinity; witne&s;s the labours of Clarke, Barrow, and Atter|bury. The lawyers are remarkably &s;killed in all the branches of their profe&s;&s;ion, and plead with equal eloquence and preci&s;ion. Elocution &s;eems a natural talent among the Engli&s;h of all ranks, who, from the bi&s;hop to the cobler, accu&s;tom them&s;elves to harrangue in public. At a meeting of journey|men taylors, one may be entertained with tropes, figures, and all the flowers of rhetorick. With re|&s;pect to a&s;&s;emblies of a higher nature, &s;ome of them are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;trokes of

oratory; and many &s;peeches are made in both hou&s;es of parliament, which would not have di&s;|graced a Roman &s;enate, at the zenith of their elo|quence and patrioti&s;m. Medical knowledge flouri&s;hes in England, as much as in any other part of Europe. Sydenham, Friend, and Mead, will be always numbered among the be&s;t writers in phy&s;ic. The phy&s;icians, exclu&s;ive of their own province, are well tinctured with other arts and &s;ciences, in con&s;equence of an exten&s;ive and liberal academical education. Many of this cla&s;s have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the world of ta&s;te and polite literature. They are generally well bred, though formal in appearance, compa&s;&s;ionate, ge|nerous, and humane. Being ea&s;y in circum&s;tances, they live like men of fa&s;hion, are always con&s;idered as gentlemen, and every where re&s;pected on account of their profe&s;&s;ion. The other branches of medi|cine are likewi&s;e cultivated in the mo&s;t reputable manner. The profe&s;&s;ors of &s;urgery and pharmacy acquire plentiful fortunes, maintain equipages and villas, keep a re&s;pectable place in the ranks of life, and are admitted into the be&s;t company. Meta|phy&s;icks and natural philo&s;ophy are &s;tudied even by the vulgar in England. The names of Newton, Locke, and Hally, will always be remembered with admiration and e&s;teem. Many &s;ceptical per|formances, equally bold and ingenious, have made their appearance in the Engli&s;h language; and much learning and argument have been exhau&s;ted in controver&s;ies, between dei&s;tical and orthodox writers. Foreigners have ob&s;erved, that England was defective of hi&s;torians: but the cau&s;e of that reproach is now removed. The ta&s;k of collecting, collating, and arranging old papers and records, is but ill &s;uited to the impatience of the Engli&s;h di&s;|po&s;ition: but, this labour being in a great mea&s;ure &s;urmounted by tho&s;e who had no other merit than

indu&s;try, divers Engli&s;h authors have lately exhi|bited elegant &s;pecimens of hi&s;torical talents. Ma|thematics have made a greater progre&s;s, and me|chanical knowledge has been more u&s;efully reduced to practice, in this, than in any other nation; wit|ne&s;s the curious clocks, watches, carriages, mills, machines and engines of various kinds, with which the kingdom abounds. It would be need|le&s;s to enumerate all the authors of eminence, who have done honour to this country by their writings and di&s;coveries, in every branch of human literature. It may become nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that this general di&s;&s;emination of knowledge through all de|grees of people, is owing to a variety of concur|ring cau&s;es, namely, the freedom of the govern|ment, that permits the people to &s;peak their &s;enti|ments on all &s;ubjects without re&s;erve; the liberty of the pre&s;s, which allows every author to com|municate his lucubrations to the public, without their being &s;ubjected to the in&s;pection and ca&s;tiga|tion of a licencer; the &s;ects and factions, that in the cour&s;e of their mutual animo&s;ity and oppo&s;ition, &s;ti|mulate them to inquire, unfold and di&s;cu&s;s all the in|tricacies and doubts of politics and religion; the public lectures delivered on a variety of &s;ubjects, and open to all comers for a moderate con&s;ideration, in the metropolis, as well as in other cities and towns of Great Britain; the incredible &s;eries of books, pam|phlets, Reviews, Magazines, and news-papers, daily publi&s;hed; the circulating libraries, that furni&s;h the reader with books at &s;o much a quarter; the &s;ocieties for the propagation of knowledge, and the encouragement of the arts, which have been erect|ed in London, and different parts of the kingdom; the theatrical entertainments in the capital; the infinite number of coffee-hou&s;es, clubs, and meet|ings in taverns and public hou&s;es, which engro&s;s great part of the time that the Engli&s;h people can

<HEAD>LIBERAL ARTS. POETRY, MUSIC, PAINTING, SCULPTURE, and ARCHITECTURE.</HEAD>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;oil, the liberal arts cannot fail to ri&s;e with &s;ome degree of beauty and vigour: for genius, though neglected by the great, is cheri&s;hed by the people. In other countries, it finds encouragement and protection from the bounty of kings, and gene|ro&s;ity of particular patrons. In England it enjoys no protection but from the laws, and no patronage but from the public. The Engli&s;h poets have met with uncommon applau&s;e from per&s;ons of ta&s;te in all countries, and their works have been tran&s;|lated into different languages. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that they have generally more genius than ta&s;te, more &s;pirit than art, more &s;trength than beauty; and that &s;ome of their mo&s;t admired pieces are replete with impurity, ab&s;urdity, and extra|vagance. Spencer, who flouri&s;hed in the &s;ixteenth century, is &s;till admired for his numbers, imagi|nation, and de&s;cription, manife&s;ted in his allegori|cal poem, intituled, The Fairie Queen, written in the mea&s;ure called &s;tanza, which, together with the nature of the plan, he borrowed from the Orlando Purio&s;o of the Italian poet Ario&s;to. The Paradi&s;e

Lo&s;t of Milton, though defective in its plan, tho' &s;tiffened with foreign idioms, technical terms, and uncouth expre&s;&s;ions, and in &s;ome places flattened with tame dialogue, exhibits &s;uch a &s;tupendous force of genius, as amazes, confounds, and tran&s;|ports the reader; in&s;omuch that it is univer&s;ally ranked with the fir&s;t epic poems of antiquity. Dryden takes the lead in lyric poetry: Butler &s;tands almo&s;t alone in the province of humorous and witty doggrel: the &s;atire and epi&s;tles of Pope as yet are unequalled: the Sea&s;ons of Thom&s;on are replete with philo&s;ophy and poetical de&s;cription; and we may be allowed to mention, The Art of pre&s;erving Health, as an excellent didactic poem. Scarce a month pa&s;&s;es in London, without giving birth to &s;ome poetical performance, which would be ju&s;tly applauded and admired in any other civilized coun|try where the&s;e e&s;&s;ays are not &s;o common: but in England, at pre&s;ent, very little attention is paid to any &s;ort of modern poetry but that which belongs to the drama. Divers new tragedies have met with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s; and fre&s;h pieces of this kind are every year produced; but very few comedies have lately appeared: a circum&s;tance the more re|markable, as the nation abounds with original characters, and the people are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to ridi|cule. The humour of modern writers &s;eldom di&s;|plays it&s;elf, except in ballads, &s;atires, farce, or a kind of romance, which is peculiar to this country, re|pre&s;enting the characters of common life as they are &s;uppo&s;ed to occur in the adventures of &s;ome particular per&s;on; a &s;pecies of writing, which, if well executed, is equally in&s;tructive and entertain|ing. With re&s;pect to dramatic pieces, the Eng|li&s;h people &s;eem to be &s;atisfied with the &s;tock be|queathed to them by the authors of the la&s;t century, whom they admire with a kind of infatuated vene|ration. Their mo&s;t approved performances are
<PB N="228" REF="2350">
unequal, irregular, and in many places ab&s;urd; yet even the&s;e ab&s;urdities are hallowed by the voice of the public; and a &s;en&s;ible foreigner, who has heard of the genius, ta&s;te, and erudition &s;o con&s;picuous in the i&s;land, will, no doubt, be &s;urpri&s;ed when we affirm, that there is hardly one regular tragedy or comedy of any reputation exhibited on the Eng|li&s;h &s;tage. Their favourite writers have made amends for the want of regularity, by the amazing force of their genius, their fire, character, pa&s;&s;ion, poetry, incident, wit, and humour; in which par|ticulars they &s;tand unrivalled by the dramatic au|thors of any other country. Shake&s;pear and Ot|way maintain the fir&s;t places in tragedy; while John&s;on, Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanburgh, are e&s;teemed the be&s;t of their comic writers. The Engli&s;h &s;tage is as elegant and well conducted as any theatre in Europe, whether we con&s;ider the mu&s;ick, the actors, or the decorations. There is a complete band at each theatre, con&s;i&s;ting of able performers. The actors are in general decent, &s;en|&s;ible, and ma&s;ters of the different parts they repre|&s;ent. Some of both &s;exes are excellent, both in tragedy and comedy: one or two are admired as prodigies in the art of acting. Many motives con|cur to &s;timulate their endeavours. Their &s;alaries are very large; and, far from being &s;tigmatized with the mark of reprobation, as in other countries, they are e&s;teemed by the public, and care&s;&s;ed by the be&s;t company, provided they pre&s;erve their morals un|tainted. The income of a favourite player com|monly exceeds one thou&s;and pounds yearly. They keep their equipages and a&s;&s;emblies, appear in rich attire, and live in ea&s;e and affluence. The enter|tainment of the Engli&s;h theatre con&s;i&s;ts of a pre|lude of mu&s;ic, a play, whether tragedy or comedy, with mu&s;ic and dancing between the acts, and is concluded with a petite piece, either farce or pan|tomime;

<P>The people of England are extremely fond of mu&s;ic: they are generally ble&s;&s;ed with di&s;tingui&s;h|ing ears and agreeable voices; and delight in learning to play upon the German flute, the vio|lin, and the harp&s;ichord, which la&s;t in&s;trument, together with the &s;pinette, guitarre, and pandola, are peculiar to the ladies. There is not a club in the kingdom, without one member or more, capable of entertaining the company with a &s;ong; and every corner of the &s;treets and allies, is occupied by a ragged &s;yren, chanting ballads of Robin Hood and black-eyed Su&s;an. Notwith&s;tanding this ge|neral turn for mu&s;ic there is no &s;tile in this art which can be properly deemed Engli&s;h. True it is, the na|tion has produced &s;everal men of genius, renowned for their mu&s;ical compo&s;itions; but the&s;e were all formed upon the Italian ta&s;te. This is the ca&s;e with many ingenious arti&s;ts now living, who &s;tudy and imitate the &s;tile of Italian ma&s;ters. The Engli&s;h qua|lity &s;ub&s;cribe for the maintenance of an Italian opera, and by extravagant appointments allure the be&s;t voices and mu&s;icians in Europe. This enter|tainment, &s;et apart for fa&s;hionable people, is very perfect in its kind; and here the mo&s;t celebrated operas are performed with incredible excellence of execution, as well as with great magnificence of dre&s;s and decoration, inter&s;per&s;ed with high dancing by the fir&s;t performers in Europe. Be|&s;ides the opera, there is a &s;urpri&s;ing number of public and private concerts maintained in the me|tropolis, as well as in other cities and towns of Great Britain.</P>

<HEAD>SOCIETIES for PROPAGATING KNOWLEDGE.</HEAD>
<P>One of the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t honourable in&s;titutions of this kind, is the Royal Society, con&s;i&s;ting of a pre&s;ident, council, and fellows, incorporated by letters-patent of king Charles II. and ve&s;ted with divers privileges and immunities, for the purpo&s;e of cultivating and improving natural knowledge. The pre&s;ident, trea&s;urer, and &s;ecretaries, are cho&s;en, and the council is renewed every year: they are governed by a body of &s;tatutes; and they hold weekly meetings to make experiments, di&s;cour&s;e on different &s;ubjects of natural philo&s;ophy, read papers, receive letters, and an&s;wer corre&s;|pondents. In a word, it is a mo&s;t excellent in&s;ti|tution, rendered famous by many illu&s;trious mem|bers, who&s;e labours have reflected light upon the whole circle of natural philo&s;ophy, and great ho|nour on the nations which gave them birth. Emi|nent naturali&s;ts, mathematicians, a&s;tronomers, and mechanics, as well as the lovers of learning of all ranks, in many different countries, have been proud to &s;ee them&s;elves enrolled as members of the Royal Society; and every country in Europe has been enriched with knowledge gleaned from their tran&s;actions, which are yearly publi&s;hed for the benefit of mankind. An in&s;titution of this kind, which comprehends the whole circle of li|terature, and embraces the arti&s;ts and learned of all countries, without di&s;tinction of religion or politicks, cannot fail to produce many di&s;coveries

<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The trade of Great Britain is immen&s;e, extended over the face of the whole earth, and the profits of it are &s;o great, as to enable the nation to make in|credible efforts of power and influence. It mu&s;t be owned that no other part of the world is &s;o well adapted to trade, whether we con&s;ider its &s;ituation or con&s;titution; and the inhabitants are better than any other people on earth, qualified to avail them|&s;elves of the&s;e advantages. The Engli&s;h merchants traffic largely with Ru&s;&s;ia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Hamburgh, Bremen, both &s;ides of the Baltic, all the northern parts of Germany, Holland, Flanders, Portugal, Sicily, Italy, the Levant, the coa&s;t of Africa, the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies. The trade to Spain was formerly very con&s;iderable, though now impaired; and although an open com|merce with France is di&s;couraged by &s;evere im|po&s;ts, that kingdom receives con&s;iderable &s;ums yearly, from the Briti&s;h dominions, in exchange for its wines, brandy, and the laces, &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, and other commodities which are &s;muggled into Eng|land, Scotland, and Ireland. The commodities exported from England are comprehended in the different articles of corn, cattle, &s;hip provi&s;ion, of
<PB N="234" REF="2410">
butter, chee&s;e, beef, pork, and bi&s;cuit, iron, lead, tin, copper, manufactured and unmanufactured, leather, copperas, allum, pit-coal, &s;affron, hops, flax, hats, &s;hoes, herrings, pilchards, cod, &s;almon, oy&s;ters, liquorice, watches, ribbons, toys; and all the different manufactures of wool, &s;uch as broad cloths, bays, ker&s;ies, ru&s;hes, &s;erges, &s;ays, frizes, &s;tuffs, flannels, rugs, caps, and &s;tockings. The products of wool are the principal articles of the Engli&s;h traffic, the exports of them exceeding two millions yearly. The fi&s;hery is very con&s;iderable, and, if properly cultivated, would equal if not excel any other branch of commerce. It con&s;i&s;ts of pickled herrings, cod, ling, and tu&s;k, from Shetland, and the Scotti&s;h coa&s;t; red herrings from Yarmouth; and pilchards from the we&s;tern coa&s;t of England: be&s;ides, a con&s;iderable number of &s;hips are annually employed in the whale fi&s;hery of Spitzbergen, thereto encouraged by a con&s;ider|able bounty from the government. Prodigious quantities of hard-ware and hou&s;hold uten&s;ils from England are annually exported to other countries, &s;uch as cannons, mortars, bombs, guns, pi&s;tols, and &s;words, locks, &s;pades, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, razors, and other edge-tools, coppers, kettles, &s;auce-pans, pewter, and other hou&s;hold uten&s;ils of bra&s;s and iron: the&s;e are unequalled in workman|&s;hip by the handicraft&s;men of other kingdoms; and the Engli&s;h clocks and watches are famous in every civilized part of the globe. The &s;ea-coal, tin, lead, and allum, &s;old to foreign nations, produce above half a million annually at a medium. But the trade carried on with every nation, is not ad|vantageous to England. A con&s;iderable &s;um of money is paid in ballance to Ru&s;&s;ia, Denmark, and Sweden, for naval &s;tores, furs, timber, iron, and &s;teel. The money, however, will we hope be
<PB N="235" REF="2420">
&s;aved in a little time to the nation, as all the&s;e ar|ticles may be furni&s;hed by the Briti&s;h colonies in America. The trade with Germany is of little con&s;equence; and that of Holland, France, and Flanders, prejudicial to the Engli&s;h nation, if we except the tobacco, which is furni&s;hed by contract with the farmers of that commodity in France. The French merchants have, in a great mea&s;ure, ruined the Engli&s;h commerce with Spain and the Levant, by under&s;elling them in the mar|kets of tho&s;e countries. The trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies is monopolized by a company, who enrich them&s;elves at the expence of the nation. The articles imported from India are chiefly &s;uperflui|ties, and if they were not, the profits ari&s;ing from the trade would not indemnify the kingdom for the expence of fleets and armies maintained by the public for the defence of the &s;ettlements be|longing to this monopoly: but, if the truth mu&s;t be owned, the company is an engine of &s;tate, &s;upported for the purpo&s;es of government. How far it is practicable to render this commerce more advantageous to the nation, by &s;haring with the Dutch the &s;pice-trade, and the traffic with Japan, is a que&s;tion that may one day de&s;erve the attention of the legi&s;lature. At pre&s;ent, the Ea&s;t-India company exports broad cloths, and other articles of the woollen manufacture, all &s;orts of hard ware, lead, and bullion. Their imports con&s;i&s;ts of gold, diamonds, raw &s;ilk, drugs, tea, pepper, arrack, porcelaine ware, &s;alt-petre for home con&s;umption; and of wrought &s;ilks, mu&s;lins, callicoes, cottons, and all the woven manufactures of India, for exportation to foreign countries. The trade with the Portugueze is very beneficial to England; for they u&s;e a much greater quantity of the produce of Great Britain than their wines and their fruit will refund; and all the overplus is payed in gold.
<PB N="236" REF="2430">
The French, however, begin to rival the Engli&s;h in the markets of Portugal, which they &s;upply with cloths at much ea&s;ier rates than tho&s;e de|manded by the merchants of Great Britain. They have plenty of materials, and their labour is cheap. The trade with Spain was formerly very exten&s;ive and advantageous, and &s;till employs a con&s;iderable number of &s;hips; but this branch of commerce is greatly decayed. The Spaniards have &s;et up woollen manufactures at home; they are &s;upplied with many nece&s;&s;aries by France; and, &s;ince the commencement of the late war, they have turned their neutrality to the be&s;t advantage, by carrying on an active trade in their own bottoms.</P>
<P>The commerce of the Engli&s;h to the coa&s;t of Guinea is of great importance to the nation. They &s;upply the negroes with cloths, cottons, checques, printed linnens, &s;pirits, all &s;orts of ne|ce&s;&s;aries, arms, and ammunition, the manufacture of Great Britain; in return for which, they receive &s;laves for the plantations, elephants teeth, gums, and gold du&s;t. The traffic for &s;laves, however, is barbarous, inhuman, and a reproach to a free country. It is not to be doubted that the trade to Africa might be extended and improved to much greater advantage, without this &s;candalous commerce in human fle&s;h; and it might be ea&s;ily proved, that the plantations in America could be &s;ufficiently laboured by hired &s;ervants. For the protection and convenience of the trade to Guinea, the African company has erected &s;everal ca&s;tles on different parts of the coa&s;t; the govern|ment allows an annual &s;um for the maintenance of the&s;e &s;orts; and the commerce is open to every adventurer. The Levant trade, including that of the Turkey company, and the traffic carried on in the different ports of Italy and the Archipe|lago, though not &s;o con&s;iderable as heretofore, is
<PB N="237" REF="2440">
yet pro&s;ecuted with advantage to the nation. The Engli&s;h commodities &s;ent to the&s;e countries, con|&s;i&s;t of woollen cloths of all kinds, hard-ware, iron uten&s;ils, clocks, watches, block tin, iron tinned, lead, fi&s;h, verdigrea&s;e, &s;pices, cochineal, and logwood. In return for the&s;e, England re|ceives raw &s;ilk, goats and camels hair, mohair, yarn, drugs, wine, oil, Cypre&s;s-wood, fu&s;tic, ebony, rai&s;ins, currants, figs, pomegranates, ver|micelli, honey, wax, &s;oap, orange-flower water, &s;weet-meats, chee&s;e, velvets, cottons, and paper. But the greate&s;t object of Engli&s;h commerce, is the intercour&s;e between it and its own colonies in America. The&s;e flouri&s;hing plantations con&s;ume an infinite quantity of the Briti&s;h manufactures, for which the coloni&s;ts pay with the produce of their own lands and indu&s;try, in the different arti|cles of &s;ugar, rum, tobacco, fi&s;h, timber, naval &s;tores, lumber, iron, furs, rice, drugs, indigo, and raw &s;ilk. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cape Breton has enabled the Engli&s;h to engro&s;s the whole fi&s;hing trade of North America, which, if duly pro&s;ecuted, will make a yearly return to Great Britain of two millions &s;terling; employ a va&s;t number of fami|lies; &s;erve as a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen; and greatly extend the navigation of Old England. The con|que&s;t of Canada not only &s;ecures the frontiers of the Briti&s;h colonies from the attempts of an am|bitious lawle&s;s neighbour; but delivers them from all competition in commerce, and opens an im|men&s;e field for the fur-trade, among the remote Indians of that va&s;t and hitherto unknown country.</P>
<P>The importance of the&s;e colonies may be gue&s;&s;ed from the following &s;pecimens. Seventy-five thou|&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar were annually imported from the i&s;lands belonging to England, before the acqui&s;ition of the Grenades and neutral i&s;lands, which in time will make a con&s;iderable addition. Ca|rolina
<PB N="238" REF="2450">
exports yearly of its own produce, &s;eventy thou&s;and barrels of rice, each weighing four hun|dred pounds, five thou&s;and barrels of pitch and tar, two thou&s;and barrels of indigo, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable quantity of raw &s;ilk. Virginia and Maryland afford annually &s;eventy thou&s;and hog|&s;heads of tobacco, two thirds of which are re-ex|ported from Great Britain, to Germany, France, and Holland.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature, con&s;cious of the amazing ad|vantages accruing to the nation from a well-con|certed commerce, vigorou&s;ly executed, has from time to time cheri&s;hed it with the utmo&s;t attention. It hath in&s;tituted wi&s;e laws and regulations for the conduct and improvement of different manufac|tures, as well as of foreign trade: it hath granted particular protection and encouragement to infant arts and new branches of traffic, by conferring peculiar privileges and immunities, and be&s;towing bounties upon tho&s;e by whom they have been di&s;|covered and exerci&s;ed. It was with this laudable view, that exclu&s;ive charters were granted to cer|tain companies, who undertook, at a great expence, to open and maintain &s;ome important channels of trade. Thus the Ea&s;t-India company was fir&s;t in|corporated in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and in a particular manner countenanced and favoured by all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns of Great Britain, till the reign of king William, when the parlia|ment finding that they did not trade to a &s;ufficient extent, or an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of their fir&s;t in&s;ti|tution, li&s;tened to the petition of another body of merchants, who were incorporated under the name of the New Ea&s;t-India company, and ve&s;ted with all the immunities enjoyed by the old company, which by the &s;ame act was indulged with leave to continue the trade for three years longer. The fund of the new company was &s;o con&s;iderably
<PB N="239" REF="2460">
&s;welled by &s;ub&s;criptions, that in le&s;s than two years they equipped forty &s;ail of large &s;hips for this com|merce, and &s;ent a million &s;terling in &s;pecie annu|ally to the Ea&s;t-Indies. In the year 1702, the two companies, at their mutual reque&s;t, were united in a new charter granted by queen Anne. This being ex|pired, another was granted, and finally prolonged by the late king, till the year 1780, when the company's exclu&s;ive right of trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies will cea&s;e and determine, provided they &s;hall have three years notice, and receive payment of the capital &s;tock borrowed by the government, and the annuities. There is very little rea&s;on, however, to &s;uppo&s;e that either the government will be in a condition or inclined to repay the&s;e &s;ums, which amount to above four millions &s;terling. Tho&s;e who may be intru&s;ted with the management of af|fairs, will always know how much this company depends upon the government, and how far this dependence may be turned to advantage; and the company are too &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t profits ari&s;ing from the trade, to forfeit them unnece&s;&s;arily, when a renewal of their charter may be obtained for a con&s;ideration which they can &s;o well afford to offer. This is the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing of all the trading com|panies in England; and, indeed, one of the mo&s;t wealthy and powerful in Europe, as appears by the number of &s;hips they con&s;tantly employ, and the con&s;iderable &s;ettlements, magazines, and &s;tore|hou&s;es which they maintain at home and abroad. All per&s;ons without exception, whether foreigners or natives, men or women, are admitted as mem|bers into this company. Every individual who pur|cha&s;es five hundred pounds worth of the company's &s;tock, is intitled to a vote in the general courts; and every per&s;on laying out two thou&s;and pounds in this &s;tock, is qualified to be cho&s;en a director. The number of the&s;e does not exceed four and
<PB N="240" REF="2470">
twenty, including the chairman and deputy-chair|man, each enjoying a yearly &s;alary. The whole $$e elected annually. They &s;it at lea&s;t once a-week, and are &s;ummoned occa&s;ionally. From the body of the directors divers committees are cho&s;en to in|&s;pect the different branches of the company's bu&s;i|ne&s;s; &s;uch as the committees of corre&s;pondence, of buying, of the trea&s;ury, of warehou&s;es, of &s;hip|ping, of accounts, of the hou&s;e, and of private trade.</P>
<P>The next monopoly that claims our attention, is the South-&s;ea company, if that may be called a monopoly which carries on no &s;ort of traffic but &s;tock-jobbing. This company originally con&s;i&s;t|ed of the public creditors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of navy-bills, tickets, and debentures, undi&s;charged. By an act of parliament in the reign of queen Anne, they were formed into a joint &s;tock company, and cor|poration, ve&s;ted with an exclu&s;ive right to open and carry on a trade to South-America, from the river Oroonoko to Cape-Horn, on the Terra del Fuego, and through the South-&s;ea, to the mo&s;t northern part of America. The queen afterwards transferred to them the benefit of the A&s;&s;iento con|tract with Spain, by which they engaged to &s;up|ply the Spaniards with &s;laves for their mines and plantations in America; and enjoyed the privilege of &s;ending a large &s;hip annually, laden with Euro|pean commodities, to the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies. They were al&s;o bound by their charter to promote the Briti&s;h fi&s;hery, and actually &s;ent a few &s;hips to Greenland, without either oeconomy or &s;ucce&s;s. They, for &s;ome time indeed, furni&s;hed the Spa|niards with negroes, and &s;ent the annual &s;hip, which was productive of great mi&s;chief to the trade of England: but they never dreamed of putting in execution the principal part of the de&s;ign, which was a commerce to South America;
<PB N="241" REF="2480">
a commerce which could not have been maintained without producing an open rupture between Eng|land and Spain, and giving umbrage to all the trading powers of Europe. The debt due by the public to the navy and army, converted into the capital &s;tock of this company, amounted to above nine millions &s;terling; and the parliament impo&s;ed certain duties for paying an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. for this capital, which by an act in the reign of George I. was increa&s;ed to ten millions; and then they agreed to accept an intere&s;t of five per cent. from the government. In the &s;equel, &s;uch an ad|ditional number of public debts were &s;ub&s;cribed into their &s;tocks, that their capital increa&s;ed to three and thirty millions and upwards, for which they agreed to take of the government an intere&s;t of five per cent. until Mid&s;ummer of the year 1727, and from that date to be contented with four per cent. By this reduction of intere&s;t, the nation &s;aved an overplus, which obtained the name of the Sinking-fund; a &s;aving, which had it been properly managed, and hone&s;tly applied, would in little more than forty years have di&s;charged the whole debt of the nation, without the nece&s;&s;ity of laying new burthens upon the &s;ubject. In con&s;e|quence of this la&s;t contract with the government, the company was enabled by an act of parliament to take in money &s;ub&s;criptions, and ve&s;ted with other privileges, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e great advantages. It is not our province to explain the South-&s;ea &s;cheme, projected by Sir John Blunt, one of the directors; or to relate the artifices that were u&s;ed to inflame the avarice of the public, the frantic eagerne&s;s of the people after &s;ub&s;crip|tions, the protentous ri&s;e of the &s;tock, the &s;udden bur&s;ting of the delu&s;ive bubble, the ferment of the nation, the interpo&s;ition of parliament, the puni&s;h|ment inflicted on the directors and accomplices
<PB N="242" REF="2490">
in that iniquitous tran&s;action, and the re&s;toration of public credit, whereby the South-&s;ea company has been enabled to execute its contract with the government. Suffice it to &s;ay, that by a treaty &s;igned at Madrid, in the year 1750, between their Britannie and Catholic maje&s;ties, the South-&s;ea company gives up all claim to the A&s;&s;iento contract, and annual &s;hip, which had long been interrupted by wars and di&s;putes between the two crowns; and in lieu of all claims on Spain, of this, or any other nature, accepts the &s;um of one hundred hou&s;and pounds &s;terling, to be paid either in Madrid or London, within the term of three months, to be reckoned from the day on which the treaty was &s;igned. At pre&s;ent, the company &s;eems to have forgot the original de&s;ign of their in&s;titution. The proprietors content them&s;elves with the revenues ari&s;ing from the funds &s;ettled upon them by act of parliament; and &s;ome of the mo&s;t wealthy among them find means to increa&s;e their fortunes con&s;iderably by the practice of &s;tock|jobbing.</P>
<P>The Turkey company was by letters-patent of king James I. erected into a body-corpo|rate, by the name of the governor and company of merchants of England, trading to the Levant|&s;eas; but notwith&s;tanding the privileges granted to this a&s;&s;ociation, it never was intended as a mo|nopoly: for all &s;ubjects of England, being mer|chants, had a right, upon paying a &s;light fine, to be admitted into the company, and enjoy the be|nefit of the trade. The company, however, hav|ing the power of making bye-laws for the good rule and government of the members of this fel|low&s;hip, laid many re&s;trictions, to the hindrance of commerce, and, in particular, a penalty of twenty per cent, upon all the merchandize &s;ent to Turkey, at any other times, or in any other &s;hips, than
<PB N="243" REF="2500">
tho&s;e appointed by the company; &s;o that in time it became a mere monopoly. It maintains the king's amba&s;&s;ador at Con&s;tantinople, as well as con&s;uls and factors at all the trading towns in Turkey; and hath at different times obtained va|luable privileges, by capitulations, with the Ot|toman emperor: but the trade hath continued to decrea&s;e for many years. The company imputed this decay to the &s;ucce&s;s of the woollen manufac|ture in France, which produces cloths made of Spani&s;h wool, though not &s;o &s;ub&s;tantial as tho&s;e of England, yet more &s;oft, light, better dyed, and cheaper, con&s;equently more &s;aleable in the Turki&s;h markets. On the other hand, the Engli&s;h manu|facturers affirm, that they could produce cloths of the &s;ame texture, colours, and cheapne&s;s, pro|vided they were allowed to export them in their own bottoms, at their own times, and from every port without di&s;tinction: but that they were &s;o hampered by the regulations and bye-laws of the company, and &s;ubjected to &s;uch extraordinary ex|pence in carriage to London, package, brokerage, and ware-hou&s;e room, be&s;ides the charge of dying them in the capital, where labour and materials are &s;o dear, that it could not be expected they &s;hould be able to &s;ell them cheap at a foreign mar|ket. The legi&s;lature taking the&s;e things into con|&s;ideration, by a law enacted in the year 1754, laid the Turkey and Levant trade open to every &s;epa|rate adventurer, who &s;hould pay a &s;mall fine to the company for admi&s;&s;ion, and take an oath to be obedient and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the company's governor, deputy-governor, and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, in all lawful mat|ters. Whether this indulgence will have the de|&s;ired effect in retrieving this commerce to the na|tion, time will &s;oon di&s;cover.

The Ru&s;&s;ian company, fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter in the reign of Philip and Mary, was after|wards confirmed by queen Elizabeth, with exclu|&s;ive privileges, which are now, in many re&s;pects, ob&s;olete. It re&s;erves, however, &s;uch authority, as excludes all foreigners, except Ru&s;&s;ians, from a participation in this commerce. But the trade is open to every natural-born prote&s;tant &s;ubject of Great Britain, upon his paying five pounds for ad|mi&s;&s;ion as a freeman of the company. This being obtained, he may equip &s;hips, and &s;ettle a hou&s;e in Ru&s;&s;ia on his own private account, &s;ubject to a &s;mall tax, which the company levies on extraordi|nary occa&s;ions, for the relief of poor &s;eamen, and the widows of decea&s;ed mariners.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h factory &s;ettled at Hamburgh, incor|porated into a company, con&s;i&s;ting of a governor, deputy-governor, and thirty members, once en|joyed an exclu&s;ive privilege of importing cloth into that city; but now this privilege is extended to all the inhabitants. The factory, however, is greatly re&s;pected by the Hamburghers: all di&s;putes among them&s;elves are decided by a majority of voices: they likewi&s;e judge in differences between them and the inhabitants of the city; but in tho&s;e ca&s;es they act in concert, with a deputation of two &s;e|nators.</P>
<P>The royal African company was likewi&s;e an in|corporated monopoly, erected in the reign of Charles II. ve&s;ted with an exclu&s;ive right to trade on the coa&s;t of Guinea, where they built and main|tained a number of forts and &s;ettlements. In the year 1697, the parliament laid the trade to Africa open to all &s;ubjects of England, impo&s;ing a duty of ten per cent. ad valorem, on all merchandize exported to that coa&s;t, for the term of thirteen years, to be paid to the company, in con&s;ideration of their maintaining &s;uch a number of forts and
<PB N="245" REF="2520">
ca&s;tles. At the expiration of this term, all the &s;ub|jects of England were at liberty to trade without oppo&s;ition; and the company grew tired of the expence they yearly incurred by &s;upporting the ca&s;tles. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;ums of money which they received from parliament for a &s;eries of years, to enable them to maintain the&s;e forts, they allow|ed them to fall into decay, and their officers, in|&s;tead of protecting, in&s;ulted and oppre&s;&s;ed the &s;e|parate trader: at the &s;ame time it appeared, that the directors had enriched them&s;elves, while the &s;tock was bankrupt. On the&s;e, and other con&s;i|derations, the parliament in the year 1751, grant|ed a &s;um of money for making compen&s;ation to the old company for their charter, lands, forts, ca&s;tles, &s;laves, military &s;tores, and all their other effects, and ve&s;ted them in a new company of mer|chants trading to Africa. All the government and regulations of this commerce are planned by a com|mittee, which con&s;tantly &s;its at London under the in&s;pection of the board of trade. All Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects may now traffic to the coa&s;t of Guinea, with|out re&s;triction; and the parliament allows ten thou|&s;and pounds per annum for the &s;upport of the ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t profitable branches of the Eng|li&s;h commerce, is that carried on by the Hud&s;on's Bay company, erected in the reign of Charles II. with an exclu&s;ive privilege of trading in that part of North America bordering on Hud&s;on's Bay, where they have erected divers forts and &s;ettlements on the &s;ides of navigable rivers. There they trade with the wild Indians, exchanging gun powder, &s;hot, cloth, hatchets, kettles, tobacco, and Eng|li&s;h &s;pirits, for the furs of beavers, martens, moo&s;e|deer, and foxes. This trade might be extended &s;o as to employ a con&s;iderable number of &s;hips yearly, con&s;ume a great quantity of Engli&s;h manufactures,
<PB N="246" REF="2530">
and make valuable returns: but the company do not equip above four &s;hips annually for this traffic, con|tenting them&s;elves with the immen&s;e profits they draw from the&s;e cargoes, which are &s;aid to fetch above two thou&s;and per cent. The legi&s;lature hath more than once expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to extend this com|merce; but the company have as often found means to &s;tifle all parliamentary inquiry, which is now, indeed, the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, as the conque&s;t of Ca|nada will diffu&s;e the fur trade through a great many different channels.</P>
<P>Of late years, the legi&s;lature of England has been more than u&s;ually attentive to the commercial in|tere&s;ts of Great Britain. It permitted pig and bar iron to be imported from the Briti&s;h colonies in North-America, and encouraged the growth of &s;ilk in the Briti&s;h plantations; it granted a large bounty of forty &s;hillings per ton on every &s;hip that &s;hould be fitted out for the whale fi&s;hing; delivered the trade to the coa&s;t of Africa from all ob&s;truc|tions and oppre&s;&s;ions; and gave ri&s;e to the &s;ociety of the free Briti&s;h fi&s;hery, which, had it been pro|perly conducted, would have proved an inexhau&s;ti|ble &s;ource of wealth, and a perpetual nur&s;ery of &s;eamen to the nation. In the mean time it is to be lamented, that an in&s;titution &s;o well calculated for the emolument of the public, has not yet been at|tended with the happy con&s;equences that might be expected. The mi&s;carriage is probably owing to a defect in the oeconomy of the directors, un&s;kil|fulne&s;s in tho&s;e who take and cure the fi&s;h, which without all doubt are inferior to the very &s;ame &s;pecies pickled by the Dutch adventurers; and la&s;tly, to a want of a proper national &s;pirit, to for|ward and encourage the undertaking. To the&s;e concurring cau&s;es, we may add the nece&s;&s;ities of the late war, in con&s;equence of which, great numbers of fi&s;hermen and labourers have been pre&s;&s;ed into
<PB N="247" REF="2540">
the &s;ervice of the public. This branch of com|merce, which has been &s;tiled the Briti&s;h gold mine, and is now almo&s;t engro&s;&s;ed by the &s;ubjects of the United Provinces, we have more fully de&s;cribed in our account of Shetland.</P>
<P>The whole commerce of Great-Britain and her dominions employs above eight thou&s;and &s;ail of &s;hips; and half the trade of Britain centers in the port of London. There are above eight hundred large &s;hips equipped for the coal trade only; and tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els employed in coa&s;ting, are computed at two thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of trade and adventure appears in every &s;hape among the Engli&s;h people, and many different expedients are contrived for the exten&s;ion and &s;ecurity of commerce. Perhaps the mo&s;t effec|tual of the&s;e is the practice of in&s;uring, by which every merchant can for a premium of &s;o much per cent. &s;ecure his adventure, or any part of it, from the ri&s;que of &s;eas and enemies. This of it&s;elf is be|come a traffic among the traders, who, for a certain pecuniary con&s;ideration paid in hand, underwrite, or in&s;ure the merchandize of one another, on cer|tain terms &s;pecified in a &s;et form on &s;tamped paper, which is called the policy of a&s;&s;urance. When a merchant is di&s;po&s;ed to en&s;ure the whole, or any part of a cargo, he employs a broker, who, in a printed policy of in&s;urance, &s;pecifies the name of the &s;hip in which the cargo is embarked, the voyage upon which &s;he is bound, the value of the mer|chandize, and the conditions of in&s;urance. This he pre&s;ents to different merchants who are willing to underwrite, and they &s;ub&s;cribe their names for different &s;ums, as they think proper, until the whole value is &s;ub&s;cribed, receiving in the mean time the premium, each in proportion to the &s;um he has under-written: if the &s;hip is ca&s;t away, or taken by the enemy, &s;o that the cargo is lo&s;t, the
<PB N="248" REF="2550">
proprietor has recour&s;e upon the in&s;urers, who are obliged to indemnify him, by paying the different &s;ums to which they &s;ub&s;cribed. The policies of tho&s;e private under-writers are duly entered and regi&s;tered in private offices of in&s;urance, as te&s;timo|nies of under vouchers for the tran&s;action. Be&s;ides the&s;e private offices, there are in the city of Lon|don two corporations for this purpo&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parliament, one intituled, The Royal Ex|change A&s;&s;urance, and the other, The London A&s;&s;urance. They obtained the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature in the year 1720, in con&s;ideration of their paying &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds to the mini&s;try, towards di&s;charging the arrears of the civil li&s;t. They are impowered to choo&s;e governors, buy lands, borrow money, and have each an ex|clu&s;ive privilege again&s;t all other in&s;uring &s;ocieties for &s;hipping and merchandize; but this does not interfere with any private man's right of in&s;uring. London is moreover provided with other offices, for a&s;&s;uring hou&s;es and effects from fire, and &s;ums of money upon lives. In a word, there are per|&s;ons in England who will in&s;ure property from all accidents what&s;oever: they will in&s;ure imaginary value upon any &s;ort of contingency, and even ex|tend their a&s;&s;urance to the &s;hips of the enemy; a practice which has been defended as a national ad|vantage, by very &s;pecious arguments.</P>
<P>Among other circum&s;tances that facilitate com|merce in England, we mu&s;t not forget the national bank, and the traffick of private bankers, who abound in the metropolis of Great Britain. The bank of England, in&s;tituted by a parliamentary &s;anc|tion in the reign of king William III. is founded on a transferable fund, and deals by paper circula|tion on the credit of a large capital. The pretext for erecting a national bank, in imitation of other trading countries, was to extend and facilitate com|merce
<PB N="249" REF="2560">
by augmenting the circulation. It was ex|tolled as an expedient that would lower intere&s;t, rai&s;e the value of land, revive and e&s;tabli&s;h public credit, facilitate the annual &s;upplies, and &s;trengthen the hands of the government. Certain it is, a na|tional bank is attended with &s;ome advantages to trade, becau&s;e by i&s;&s;uing notes or bills to the amount of their capital, that &s;um is doubled in circulation, and diffu&s;ed through the kingdom for the conve|nience of traders. Indeed, in trading countries, where there is a &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver, &s;uch an in&s;titution becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; though, in England, it has not been altogether unattended with inconveniences. Whatever benefits may ac|crue from it to trade in general, it mu&s;t be owned, that its ri&s;e was owing to the wants of the govern|ment, which borrowed its whole capital; that it will probably be always &s;ub&s;ervient to government views, even when they may be incon&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution of the country; that it may tempt in|dividuals to withdraw their money from trade, and employ it in &s;tock-jobbing, con&s;equently produce a &s;warm of brokers and jobbers, to prey upon their fellow-creatures, and encourage fraud and gaming, &s;o as to corrupt the morals of the nation. Be&s;ides, in ca&s;e of rebellion, to which this kingdom is in a peculiar manner expo&s;ed, and in times of public danger, paper circulation having no intrin&s;ic value, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink, if not &s;upported by very ex|traordinary means: then the public credit will fail, and the whole nation be involved in bankruptcy and confu&s;ion. At pre&s;ent, however, the bank of England is the mo&s;t re&s;pectable money-corporation in Europe. It flouri&s;hes in wealth and credit, and its notes not only circulate through all parts of the Briti&s;h dominions, but are e&s;teemed as good as bullion in Holland, Hamburgh, and many other &s;tates on the continent. The private bankers are
<PB N="250" REF="2570">
beneficial to trade, by keeping large quantities of ca&s;h for an&s;wering draughts upon &s;ight, part of which they lend occa&s;ionally to merchants, upon proper &s;ecurity, thus enabling them to be punctual in their payments, even when they are di&s;appointed in returns of money. Nothing evinces the wealth and commercial genius of this nation &s;o much as the ea&s;e and di&s;patch with which payments of pro|digious &s;ums, and contracts of great importance, are made and tran&s;acted in the city of London.</P>

<HEAD>DUTIES, TAXES, PUBLIC DEBTS, FUNDS, MONEY.</HEAD>
<P>Although the Engli&s;h legi&s;lature hath cheri&s;hed the national trade with one hand, it hath likewi&s;e burthened it gradually with the other, to &s;uch a degree, that no other nation on the face of the earth was ever loaded with &s;uch taxes and impo|&s;itions; and no people could po&s;&s;ibly bear &s;uch impo&s;itions, unle&s;s they were enabled to bear them by a peculiar genius for pro&s;ecuting commerce, and &s;uch a torrent of trade as almo&s;t exceeds belief. The immen&s;ity of the traffic may be judged from the yearly revenues of Great Britain, exclu&s;ive of the civil li&s;t, amounting to eight hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant, and we may &s;ay, the perpetual impo&s;itions e&s;tabli&s;hed for the public revenue, are the land-tax, the cu&s;toms or duties upon merchan|dize, the exci&s;e, the &s;tamp-duties, and the taxes upon windows, carriages, hawkers, and pedlars. The &s;um total, rai&s;ed by the&s;e impo&s;itions, amounts to very near ten millions per annum: what the exigencies of &s;tate require over and above this exaction, is borrowed on the public credit, add|ed to the public debts, and &s;ome new tax is laid
<PB N="251" REF="2580">
and mortgaged as a &s;ecurity for payment of the intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It will appear &s;trange to foreigners, that a nation &s;o opulent as Great Britain, &s;o divided and de|tached from other countries, &s;o &s;ecured by its in|&s;ular &s;ituation, and &s;o little &s;ubject to the expence of great armies and numerous fortifications, &s;hould, neverthele&s;s, be obliged to contract debts yearly, in order to defray the public expence: this circum|&s;tance will appear &s;till more &s;trange, when they con&s;ider the heavy impo&s;itions with which the peo|ple are incumbered, and the va&s;t &s;ums which the&s;e impo&s;itions annually produce: but their a&s;toni&s;h|ment will cea&s;e, when they reflect upon the diffe|rent connexions by which this i&s;land has been the&s;e fifty years chained to the continent; the wretched policy of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive admini&s;trations, which have e&s;pou&s;ed and adopted almo&s;t every continental quar|rel, and with enormous &s;ub&s;idies hired foreign princes to fight their own battles; and, finally, the &s;y&s;tem of corruption that certain mini&s;ters had e&s;tabli&s;hed, in con&s;equence of which they fleeced the people with one hand, that they might bribe their repre&s;entatives with the other. The&s;e mea|&s;ures, pro&s;ecuted for a &s;eries of years, have multi|plied the occa&s;ions of the government, and laid it under the nece&s;&s;ity, from time to time, to con|tract debts on the public credit, that is, to borrow &s;ums on the faith of the parliament. The&s;e debts amount already to the incredible &s;um of one hun|dred and thirty millions &s;terling.</P>
<P>Great part of this debt is owing to the three great companies of the Ea&s;t Indies, Bank, and South-&s;ea, incorporated in their capitals, made transferable, by act of parliament; and the intere&s;t is regularly paid from the produce of the funds granted and appropriated for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e
<PB N="252" REF="2590">
debts are called the &s;tocks, becau&s;e converted into the &s;tock of the re&s;pective companies; and the name of funds is given to the taxes mortgaged and a&s;&s;igned for the payment of this intere&s;t. Any in|dividual, whether native or foreigner, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of money which he cannot employ to better advan|tage, may lay it out in the purcha&s;e of &s;tock, with the bank, or either of the other companies, &s;o as to enjoy a certain intere&s;t; and when he has occa|&s;ion to u&s;e the money in another way, he may &s;ell his &s;tock at the market-price. The property of the &s;tocks is divided into &s;uch an infinite number of hands, and the occa&s;ions for ready money are &s;o frequent, that there is a con&s;tant circulation of &s;tock, con&s;equently a daily market for buying and &s;elling. The transfer of &s;tock is made with &s;ur|pri&s;ing ea&s;e and expedition by &s;worn brokers, em|ployed for that purpo&s;e; and the price is nece&s;|&s;arily fluctuating, according to the change and vi|ci&s;&s;itude of tho&s;e affairs in which the &s;tate is &s;up|po&s;ed to have any, even the &s;malle&s;t concern. The rumour of an expedition intended again&s;t any part of the Briti&s;h dominions, or the report of an arma|ment abroad, though the de&s;tination of it is not known, will immediately &s;ink the price of &s;tock in Exchange-alley, where this traffic is generally carried on; and, on the other hand, it is often rai&s;ed by a petty advantage gained in the field by &s;ome di&s;tant ally of Great Britain. The &s;tocks will, undoubtedly, always be influenced by every thing that affects the fears, hopes, and pa&s;&s;ions of the proprietors, &s;o far as they re&s;pect the &s;ituation of public concerns. Public credit depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tability of the e&s;tabli&s;hed government: every incident that proves unfavourable to the government will, therefore, have more or le&s;s effect upon public credit, which
<PB N="253" REF="2600">
is the foundation of the &s;tocks, and the &s;ecurity of the proprietors: in that ca&s;e, timorous people will endeavour to make &s;ure of their own private for|tunes, by &s;elling their &s;tock; and rather than run any ri&s;que of lo&s;ing the whole, they will offer and &s;ell it at an under price: when the demand is &s;mall, and the commodity abounds, the market mu&s;t fall of cour&s;e. After the price of &s;tocks has been thus reduced, when the public is regaled with happy tidings of a battle gained, or a conque&s;t made, or an advantageous alliance concluded by Great Bri|tain, or her allies, the government &s;eems again founded on a rock, the public credit flouri&s;hes: tho&s;e who &s;old out their &s;tock from apprehen&s;ion, now ha&s;ten to the alley in order to make new pur|cha&s;es: the demand is great, and the price of &s;tock ri&s;es in proportion. Thus it mu&s;t continue to &s;hift ince&s;&s;antly with the humours and pa&s;&s;ions of man|kind; and there is always a &s;et of crafty knaves upon the watch, to turn the&s;e to their own advan|tage. Some there are who hire emi&s;&s;aries to &s;pread fal&s;e reports, that may influence the public credit either way, according as they are di&s;po&s;ed to buy or to &s;ell. When they want to &s;ell, the market is previou&s;ly rai&s;ed by good news, and an eager de|mand in the alley: on the other hand, when their intention is to buy, they can before-hand depreciate the &s;tock by means of evil tidings, and woful faces, offering to transfer; then they purcha&s;e at an un|der price. Some who deal deeply in this traffic, are at a con&s;iderable expence in procuring intelligence, that they may have the &s;tart of their brethren. In the year 1715, when an army of rebels had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Pre&s;ton, in Lanca&s;hire, and a body of forces was detached to di&s;lodge them, a certain per|&s;on, well known in the world of adventure, pro|vided relays of hor&s;es, and a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger to
<PB N="254" REF="2610">
bring him the mo&s;t early notice of the battle; and he was accordingly the fir&s;t per&s;on in London who knew of the victory which the king's forces had obtained. The price of &s;tocks had continued to &s;ink from the fir&s;t breaking out of the rebellion, and was at this period very low. The gentleman having a great &s;um of ready money at his com|mand, no &s;ooner received the intelligence, than he laid it out in the purcha&s;e of &s;tock, and the price ri&s;ing immediately when the news of the victory ar|rived in the u&s;ual way, he became a very con&s;i|derable gainer. The practice of transferring &s;tock gave ri&s;e to the infamous traffic of &s;tock-jobbing, which comprehended fictitious contracts, wagers, and the conveyance of imaginary property: but the&s;e iniquitous proceedings are now prohibited by law, under &s;evere penalties.</P>
<P>The trade and manufactures of Great Britain are &s;o various and exten&s;ive, that, exclu&s;ive of paper circulation, they cannot be carried on without a very great quantity of current coin, in gold, &s;ilver, and copper. What the total amount of the circulating ca&s;h in England may be, is not ea&s;ily a&s;certained: &s;ome have computed it at &s;ixteen millions &s;terling; but as great part of what has been coined is melted down, worn out, exported, lo&s;t, or hoarded up, and, as in the cour&s;e of circulation, the ca&s;h changes hands with &s;uch rapidity, we know not the princi|ples on which this calculation is founded.</P>
<P>The gold coin of England con&s;i&s;ts of guineas, half-guineas, and quarter-guineas, tho' the people reckon by pounds, which at pre&s;ent is an imaginary denomi|nation; the pound is equal to twenty &s;hillings, and the guinea amounts to one and twenty: but be|&s;ides the Engli&s;h pieces, the gold coin of Portugal, called Joannes and moidore, are taken in tale by all the dealers of England. Crowns, half-crowns,
<PB N="255" REF="2620">
&s;hillings, and &s;ixpences, compo&s;e the &s;ilver coin that circulates through Great Britain and Ireland: and for the convenience of retail, there is an im|men&s;e quantity of halfpence and farthings. It may be &s;uperfluous to ob&s;erve, that one crown con&s;i&s;ts of five &s;hillings; that one &s;hilling is compo&s;ed of twelve pence; and that four farthings con&s;titute one penny: no per&s;on, however, is obliged to re|ceive copper money in payment of any money that exceeds one &s;hilling. The pound, or twelve ounces Troy weight of gold, is divided at the mint into four and forty guineas and an half: one ounce of gold is worth fourteen ounces and one third of an ounce, in &s;ilver; &s;o that the proportion of gold to &s;ilver, in England, is as one to fourteen and one third. Over and above the coins we have men|tioned, there are &s;ome five guinea and two guinea pieces of gold; as well as groats, three penny, two penny, and penny pieces in &s;ilver; but the&s;e are rather kept as medals, than u&s;ed in circulation.</P>

<HEAD>COMPUTATION, WEIGHTS, and MEASURES.</HEAD>
<P>When the Engli&s;h nation &s;hook off the pope's &s;u|premacy, they rejected the Gregorian kalendar, as a part of popery, and had recour&s;e to the Julian ac|count, called <HI>the old &s;tile,</HI> which they ob&s;erved from that period till the year 1751, when it was abro|gated by act of parliament, in favour of the Gre|gorian, which is now adopted in all their months, terms, and fixed fe&s;tivals. The Engli&s;h traders in numbering cod fi&s;h, ling, and haberdine, reckon one hundred and twenty-four to the hundred; and of herrings one hundred and twenty; twelve hun|dred are given to the thou&s;and, which con&s;titute a barrel; and twelve barrels make one la&s;t. In count|ing furs, they reckon by the timber, which con|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="256" REF="2630">
of forty &s;kins: but of other &s;kins five &s;core only are allowed to the hundred. Twenty-four &s;heets of paper make a quire; twenty quire con&s;ti|tute a ream; and ten ream compo&s;e a bale. Twelve &s;kins of parchment make a dozen, and five dozen a roll. Ten hides are a dicker; and twenty dick|ers make a la&s;t; but there are ten pair of gloves in one dicker.</P>
<P>Of weights there are two &s;orts u&s;ed in England; namely Troy weight, and Averdupois: to reckon by the fir&s;t, twenty-four grains of wheat make one penny-weight &s;terling; twenty penny-weights make one ounce; and twelve ounces con&s;titute a pound. By this they weigh bread, corn, gold, &s;ilver, jewels, and liquors. But all other articles, &s;uch as mercery and grocery ware, metals, wood, and tallow, are computed by averdupois, in which &s;ixteen drachms make an ounce; &s;ixteen ounces a pound; twenty|eight pounds a quarter; four quarters a hundred; and twenty hundred a ton.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mea&s;ures con&s;i&s;t of the inch, foot, yard, fathom, perch or pole, furlong, and mile. An inch is equal to three barley corns; twelve inches make one foot; three feet are equal to one yard; two yards make one fathom; &s;ixteen feet and an half con&s;titute one perch, pole, or rood; forty poles make a furlong; and eight furlongs make an Engli&s;h mile, amounting to &s;eventeen hundred and &s;ixty yards, according to act of par|liament. An Engli&s;h acre con&s;i&s;ts of forty perches in length, and four in breadth; and an hundred acres are accounted a hide of land.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o receptive mea&s;ures both for li|quids and &s;olids. The &s;malle&s;t mea&s;ure for liquids, is called a pint; two pints make a quart; two quarts make a pottle; two pottles make a gallon; eight gallons a firkin; two firkins a kilderkin; two kilderkins a barrel; and twelve barrels a la&s;t

The wine mea&s;ures are &s;maller than tho&s;e of ale and beer, nearly in the proportion of four to five; four gallons of beer mea&s;ure are almo&s;t equal to five gallons of wine. A runlet of wine holds eighteen gallons; and half a hog&s;head contains thirty-one gallons and an half: forty-two gallons go to the tierce; &s;ixty-three to the hog&s;head; eighty-four to the puncheon; one hundred and twenty-&s;ix to the pipe; and two hun|dred and fifty-two to the tun.</P>

<P>The Briti&s;h dominions comprehend Great Bri|tain and Ireland, with the i&s;lands of Shetland, Ork|ney, Hebrides, Man, Scilly, and the le&s;&s;er i&s;les that appear around the coa&s;t; the i&s;lands of Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, and Alderney, on the coa&s;t of Normandy; the i&s;land of St. John's on Newfoundland, the whole tract of North America, from Ca&s;co bay, to the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, with the late con|que&s;t of Cape Breton and Canada; the &s;ugar i&s;lands of Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antigua, St. Chri&s;tophers,
<PB N="258" REF="2650">
Nevis, Dominica, St. Vincent's, Tobago, and the Grenades. To the&s;e we may add the fort of Gibraltar, by which the Engli&s;h, in a great mea&s;ure, command the Straights mouth, or pa&s;&s;age into the Mediterranean; and the i&s;land of Minorca. But we do not reckon among the Briti&s;h dominions, tho&s;e forts and factories which the merchants of Eng|land have e&s;tabli&s;hed on the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia and Africa.</P>
<P>The number of people contained in Great Bri|tain and Ireland, may amount to about eight mil|lions, allowing &s;ix for England, one for Scotland, and one for Ireland: at that rate there ought to be con&s;iderably above a million of men able to carry arms; and to the&s;e, if we add the forces that may be rai&s;ed occa&s;ionally in North America, the king of England will appear a very formidable po|tentate.</P>
<P>The land-forces of Great Britain, maintained in time of peace, do not u&s;ually exceed forty thou&s;and in number, computing eighteen thou&s;and in Eng|land and Scotland, twelve thou&s;and on the Iri&s;h e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and the remainder in garri&s;ons abroad, at Gibraltar, Nova-Scotia, New-York, Jamaica, and Antigua. In the late war, however, the na|tion maintained above one hundred thou&s;and &s;ol|diers, exclu&s;ive of marines, and an army of fifty thou&s;and Germans on the continent. The Briti&s;h infantry have always di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by a &s;pecies of courage and intrepidity peculiar to them&s;elves; and the cavalry is beyond all doubt the be&s;t in Europe, whether we re&s;pect the beauty, &s;ize, &s;pirit, and docility of the hor&s;es, or the &s;trength, appearance, and gallantry of the dragoons. In a word, the Briti&s;h troops, both hor&s;e and foot, are compo&s;ed of tall, &s;trong, mu&s;cular, hand&s;ome men, in red uniform with various facings, well
<PB N="259" REF="2660">
clothed, armed, and accoutred, inferior to none in exerci&s;e and di&s;cipline, and &s;uperior to all others in martial and military appearance.</P>
<P>The navy of England is at all times &s;uperior to any other maritime power, in number of &s;hips, weight of metal, and expert mariners; of whom twelve or fourteen thou&s;and are retained in the &s;er|vice even in time of public tranquility. But the efforts of Great Britain by &s;ea on extraordinary oc|ca&s;ions, are inconceivable. In the la&s;t war, there were near four hundred &s;hips in the navy of Eng|land; above one half of the&s;e were &s;hips of the line, carrying each, from one hundred to fifty great guns, completely equipped with men, &s;tores, and artillery; and admirably built and rigged for war or expedition. The number of &s;eamen &s;erv|ing on board of the royal navy, could not be le&s;s than four&s;core thou&s;and. Finally, the nation is &s;till farther &s;ecured by a militia rai&s;ed in each county, in con&s;equence of a late act of parliament. The whole number amounts to twenty-two thou&s;and, well di&s;ciplined; and there is no doubt but they may be of eminent &s;ervice in defending their coun|try, &s;hould it ever be in danger from the attempts of foreign enemies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The militia of England, according to the old e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, might amount to two hundred thou&s;and, hor&s;e and foot. The king cho&s;e lord lieutenants of counties, and ve&s;ted them with power to arm, array, and command the militia within their different di&s;tricts, to give commi&s;&s;ions to inferior officers, and to charge the individuals of the county for this &s;ervice, ac|cording to their abilities, in furni&s;hing hor&s;emen and foot|&s;oldiers. In a word, the lieutenant and his deputy ap|proved by the king, had power to exerci&s;e great op|pre&s;&s;ion over their fellow-&s;ub|jects. They could levy every war, one fourth of each man's proportion in the general land-tax; and oblige every man &s;o charged, to allow a month's pay to every &s;oldier, in ca&s;e of marching again&s;t the enemy; but this was re|paid by his maje&s;ty. The power of commanding and directing the militia, ve&s;ted in the king, was thought a dangerous branch of preroga|tive: indeed, they were very &s;eldom mu&s;tered, but grown ob&s;olete and u&s;ele&s;s, until the legi&s;lature new-modelled them by a late act of parliament.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Great Britain, &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and guarded by &s;uch a numerous and powerful navy, has little occa&s;ion for fortifications to defend its &s;ea-ports and
<PB N="260" REF="2670">
frontiers. Neverthele&s;s, the government hath thought proper to maintain &s;ome old ca&s;tles both in South and North Britain, as places of arms, with &s;mall garri&s;ons of invalids, who may help to pre|&s;erve the internal peace of the nation: it hath erected a chain of &s;mall forts acro&s;s the i&s;thmus of Inverne&s;s, in Scotland, to re&s;train and overawe the Highlanders that may be in the intere&s;t of the pretender: it maintains the works of Berwick, which is &s;trongly fortified, and &s;ecured with a large garri|&s;on of regular troops: it hath built the forts of Tilbury and Sheerne&s;s, to defend the mouths of the river Thames and Medway, be&s;ides &s;ome block|hou&s;es in different parts of the coa&s;t; and it hath fortified the important harbours of Port&s;mouth and Plymouth, &s;o as to &s;ecure them from any at|tempts of the enemy. After all, England mu&s;t place its chief dependence upon its navy, not only for the protection of her commerce, but al&s;o for the &s;ecurity of her coa&s;t: for, if her &s;quadrons are pro|perly divided and &s;tationed at different parts of the i&s;land, and provided with light &s;loops and frigates for intelligence and &s;udden excur&s;ions, they will al|ways be able to baffie every projected inva&s;ion. Una&s;&s;i&s;ted by a fleet, the army, though trebled, would be found in&s;ufficient to defend an open coa&s;t &s;even hundred miles in extent, from the de&s;igns of an artful and enterprizing enemy.</P>

<HEAD>DIVISION of ENGLAND and WALES.</HEAD>
<P>Having given a &s;ummary account of England in general, we &s;hall now proceed to a detail of par|ticular counties. England is divided into the &s;ix following circuits; namely, the home circuit, the Norfolk circuit, the Oxford circuit, the midland circuit, the we&s;tern circuit, and the northern cir|cuit. Each of the&s;e comprehends a certain num|ber of counties. The home circuit includes E&s;&s;ex, Hertford, Kent, Surry, and Su&s;&s;ex. In the Nor|folk circuit, we reckon Bucks, Bedford&s;hire, Hun|tingdon&s;hire, Cambridge&s;hire, Suffolk, and Nor|folk. The Oxford circuit comprehends Oxon, Berks, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Mon|mouth&s;hire, Hereford&s;hire, Salop, and Stafford|&s;hire. In the midland circuit, we find Warwick|&s;hire, Leice&s;ter&s;hire, Derby&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, Lincoln&s;hire, Rutland&s;hire, and Northampton|&s;hire. The we&s;tern circuit embraces Hants, Wilts, Dor&s;et&s;hire, Somer&s;et&s;hire, Devon&s;hire, and Corn|wall. The northern circuit comprehends York|&s;hire, the bi&s;hopric of Durham, Northumberland, Lanca&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland, and Cumberland. Nei|ther Middle&s;ex nor Che&s;hire is included in any circuit, the fir&s;t being the &s;eat of the &s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice, and the other, a county palatine.</P>
<P>The principality of Wales is divided into four circuits, called the north-ea&s;t circuit, the north-we&s;t circuit, the &s;outh-ea&s;t circuit, and the &s;outh-we&s;t circuit. In the north-ea&s;t, are contained the coun|ties of Flint, Denbigh, and Montgomery: in the north-we&s;t, tho&s;e of Angle&s;ea, Carnarvon, and Merioneth: in the &s;outh-ea&s;t, are the counties of Radnor, Brecon, and Glamorgan: in the &s;outh|we&s;t, are Pembroke&s;hire, Cardigan&s;hire, and Caer|marthen.

<HEAD>NORTHUMBERLAND; its BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and APPEARANCE.</HEAD>
<P>Northumberland, which was formerly the name of a whole kingdom, is now be&s;towed on the mo&s;t northern county of England, bounded on the north and we&s;t by the river Tweed, which divides it from Scotland, the Cheviot hills, and part of Cumberland; wa&s;hed on the ea&s;t by the German ocean, and &s;eparated from Durham on the &s;outh by the rivers Tyne and Derwent. This county, which gives the title of duke to a nobleman who married the daughter of Algernoon, duke of So|mer&s;et, who&s;e mother was heire&s;s of the Piercy fa|mily, extends about fifty miles in length from north to &s;outh, and above forty from ea&s;t to we&s;t; and is remarkably populous, containing eleven market-towns, two hundred and eighty villages, and forty-&s;ix pari&s;hes. The face of the country, e&s;|pecially towards the we&s;t, is roughened with huge mountains, the mo&s;t remarkable of which, are the Cheviot hills, and the high ridge called Ride&s;dale; but the lands are level towards the &s;ea-&s;ide, and the borders of Durham.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="263" REF="2700">
<HEAD>CLIMATE, AIR, SOIL, WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>The climate, like that of every other mountain|bus country in the neighbourhood of the &s;ea, is moi&s;t and di&s;agreeable: the air, however, is pure and healthy, as being well ventilated by breezes and &s;trong gales of wind; and in winter mitigated by the warm vapours from the two &s;eas, the Iri&s;h and the German ocean, between which it is &s;ituated. The &s;oil varies in different parts of the county. Among the hills it is barren, though it affords good pa&s;ture for &s;heep, which cover tho&s;e moun|tains. The low country, when properly cultivated, produces plenty of wheat and all &s;orts of grain; and great part of it is laid out in meadow-lands and rich inclo&s;ures. Northumberland is well wa|tered with many rivers, rivulets, and fountains: its greate&s;t rivers are the Tweed and the Tyne. The former we have de&s;cribed in our account of Scotland. The Tyne is compo&s;ed of two &s;treams, called &s;outh and north Tyne: the fir&s;t ri&s;es on the verge of Cumberland, near Al&s;ton-moor, enters Northumberland, running north to Haltwe&s;el, then bends ea&s;terly, and receiving the two &s;mall rivers ea&s;t and we&s;t Alon, unites above Hexham with the other branch, taking its ri&s;e at a mountain called Fane-head in the we&s;tern part of the county, thence called Tine dale; is &s;welled in its cour&s;e by the little river Shele; joins the Read near Billing|ham; and running in a direct line to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, is united with the &s;outhern Tyne, forming a large river that wa&s;hes Newca&s;tle, and falls into the Ger|man ocean near Tinmouth.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MINERALS, VEGETABLES, ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>In all probability, the mountains of Northum|berland contain lead ore and other mineralized me|tals
<PB N="264" REF="2710">
in their bowels, as they in all re&s;pects re&s;emble tho&s;e parts of Wales and Scotland, where lead mines have been found and pro&s;ecuted. Perhaps the inhabitants are diverted from inquiries of this nature, by the certain profits and con&s;tant employ|ment they enjoy in working the coal pits with which this country abounds. The city of London, and the greate&s;t part of England, are &s;upplied with fuel from the&s;e &s;tores of Northumberland, which are inexhau&s;tible, enrich the proprietors, and em|ploy an incredible number of hands and &s;hipping.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to vegetables, Northumberland produces the &s;ame &s;pecies and genera of plants that are found in other countries of the &s;ame latitude, diver&s;ified with mountains and vallies wa&s;hed by the &s;ea. On the highe&s;t of the Cheviot hills, there is plenty of the <HI>chamaepericlymenon,</HI> or dwarf honey|&s;uckle; and on the &s;hore, we find the <HI>e&s;trium mari|num</HI> or &s;ea buglo&s;s, and the <HI>eryngium vulgare,</HI> com|monly called friers goo&s;e. There are no natural woods of any con&s;equence in this county; but many plantations belonging to the &s;eats of noble|men and gentlemen, of which here is a great num|ber. As for pot-herbs, roots, &s;alladine, and every article of the kitchen-garden and orchard, they are here rai&s;ed in great plenty by the u&s;ual means of cultivation; as are al&s;o the fruits of more delicate flavour, &s;uch as the apricot, peach, and nectarine. The &s;pontaneous fruits it produces in common with other parts of Great Britain, are the crab-apple, the &s;loe or bullace, the hazle-nut, the acorn, hips, haws, with the berries of the bramble, the juniper, wood-&s;trawberries, cranberries, and bilberries.</P>
<P>Northumberland rai&s;es a good number of excel|lent hor&s;es and black cattle, and affords pa&s;ture for infinite flocks of &s;heep; both the cattle and &s;heep are of a large breed, but the wool is coar&s;er than that which the more &s;outhern counties produce.
<PB N="265" REF="2720">
The hills and mountains abound with a variety of game, &s;uch as red deer, foxes, hares, rabbits, heathcock, grow&s;e, partridge, quail, plover, teal, and woodcock: indeed, this is counted one of the be&s;t &s;porting countries in Great Britain. The &s;ea and rivers are well &s;tocked with fi&s;h, e&s;pecially the Tweed, in which an infinite number of &s;almon is caught and carried to Tinmouth, where being pickled, they are conveyed by &s;ea to London, and &s;old under the name of Newca&s;tle &s;almon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>The Northumbrians were antiently &s;tigmatized as a &s;avage, barbarous people, addicted to cruelty, and inured to rapine. The truth is, before the union of the two crowns of England and Scotland, the borderers on each &s;ide were extremely licentious and ungovernable, trained up to war from their infancy, and habituated to plunder by the mutual incur&s;ions made into each kingdom; incur&s;ions which neither truce nor treaty could totally prevent. People of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, who propo&s;ed to earn their livelihood by agriculture, would not on any terms remain in a country expo&s;ed to the fir&s;t violence of a bold and de&s;perate enemy: therefore the lands lay uncultivated, and in a great mea&s;ure de&s;erted by every body but lawle&s;s adventurers, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by theft and rapine. There was a tract fifty miles in length and &s;ix in breadth, be|tween Berwick and Carli&s;le, known by the name of the Debateable Land, to which both nations laid claim, though it belonged to neither; and this was occupied by a &s;et of banditti who plundered on each &s;ide, and what they &s;tole in one kingdom, they &s;old openly in the other; nay, they were &s;o dexterous in their occupation, that by means of hot bread applied to the horns of the cattle which they
<PB N="266" REF="2730">
&s;tole, they twi&s;ted them in &s;uch a manner, that when the right owners &s;aw them in the market, they did not know their own property. Wardens were appointed to guard the marches or borders in each kingdom; and the&s;e offices were always conferred on noblemen of the fir&s;t character for influence, valour, and integrity. The Engli&s;h border was divided into three marches, called the ea&s;t, we&s;t, and middle marches; the gentlemen of the coun|try were con&s;tituted deputy-wardens, who held march courts, regulated the watches, di&s;ciplined the militia, and took mea&s;ures for a&s;&s;embling them in arms at the fir&s;t alarm: but in time of peace be|tween the two nations, they were chiefly employed in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the in&s;olence and rapine of the bor|derers. Since the union of the crowns, however, Northumberland is totally changed, both with re&s;|pect to the improvement of the lands, and the re|formation of the inhabitants. The grounds, being now &s;ecure from incur&s;ion and in&s;ult, are &s;ettled by creditable farmers, and cultivated like other parts of the kingdom. As ho&s;tilities have long cea&s;ed, the people have forgot the u&s;e of arms, and exer|ci&s;ed them&s;elves in the more eligible avocations of peace; in breeding &s;heep and cattle, manuring the grounds, working at the coal-pits, and in different branches of commerce and manufacture. In their per&s;ons they are generally tall, &s;trong, bold, hardy, and fre&s;h-coloured, and though le&s;s unpoli&s;hed than their ance&s;tors, not quite &s;o civilized as their &s;outhern neighbours. The commonalty are well fed, lodged, and cloathed; and all of them remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed, by a kind of Shibboleth or whurle, being a particular way of pronouncing the letter R, as if they hawked it up from the windpipe, like the cawing of rooks. In other re&s;pects, the language they &s;peak, is an uncouth mixture of the Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h dialects. There is
<PB N="267" REF="2740">
no material di&s;tinction between the fa&s;hionable peo|ple of Northumberland, and tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank in other parts of the kingdom: the &s;ame form of education will produce the &s;ame effects in all countries. The gentlemen of Northumberland, however, are remarkable for their courage, ho&s;pi|tality, and hard drinking.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>A great number of Roman monuments have been found in this county; but the mo&s;t remarka|ble curio&s;ity of that kind con&s;i&s;ts in the remains of Hadrian's vallum, and the wall of Severus, running parallel to each other from the Solway Frith beyond Burgh on the Sands near Carli&s;le, to the neighbourhood of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, an extent of &s;ixty-eight Engli&s;h miles. Hadrian's val|lum is a rampart of earth with a large ditch to the northward, and another agger or rampart to the &s;outhward, which &s;eems to have &s;erved as a mili|tary way. The wall of Severus was built of &s;tone, twelve feet high and eight in thickne&s;s, of &s;uch ma|terials and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as to render it as &s;olid as a rock: it was &s;trengthened by a deep ditch to the northward, by turrets and ca&s;tella at certain di&s;|tances, and was accommodated with a paved mili|tary way on the &s;outh-&s;ide, though not always pa|rallel to the range of the wall, being in breadth about &s;eventeen feet. Hadrian fir&s;t rai&s;ed his val|lum, and Severus afterwards built the wall with tho&s;e ca&s;tella, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e of defend|ing the Roman province from the incur&s;ions of the Scots and Picts; and that the wall was built by the legionary &s;oldiers appears from a great num|ber of in&s;criptions upon &s;tones, found through the whole length of the <HI>pretentura:</HI> Hadrian's vallum reached no farther than Newca&s;tle; but the wall of
<PB N="268" REF="2750">
Severus is carried through that town, and ends at a &s;tationary fort near Couzen's-hou&s;e, about three miles to the ea&s;tward, where the ruins of a Roman &s;tation and town are &s;till di&s;cernible. Large portions of the wall are &s;till &s;tanding in different parts of Northumberland and Cumberland, as well as the foundations of &s;everal ca&s;tella, which appear to have been &s;ixty-&s;ix feet &s;quare, built on the &s;outh|&s;ide, adjoining to the wall, at the di&s;tance of about a mile from each other.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The mo&s;t noted towns in Northumberland, are Newca&s;tle, Morpeth, Alnwick, Berwick, Hexham, and North Shields.</P>
<P>Newca&s;tle, the capital, is a large, populous, and flouri&s;hing town, &s;ituated on the north bank of the river Tyne, about three hundred miles to the northward of London. It is connected by means of a &s;tately &s;tone bridge of &s;even arches, with the &s;uburbs of Gate&s;head, which, being on the &s;outhern &s;ide of the river, is part of the bi&s;hopric of Dur|ham. Near the &s;pot where the town now &s;tands, there was of old a fort called Monca&s;ter; and Ro|bert, &s;on of William the Conqueror, having built another to overawe the Scots, be&s;towed upon it the name of Newca&s;tle, in contradi&s;tinction to the old fortre&s;s. Divers mona&s;teries and ho&s;pitals being rai&s;ed around it, the place, in a little time, &s;welled into a town; and the walls of it were begun in the reign of Edward I. by a rich burgher, who had been taken by the Scots, and paid a large ran&s;om for his liberty. It is at pre&s;ent &s;urrounded by a &s;trong wall, in which there are &s;even gates and as many turrets, with &s;ome ca&s;e-mates &s;aid to be bomb-proof. It was created a burrough by king Richard II. who granted permi&s;&s;ion to carry a &s;word

before the mayor; and king Henry VI. erected it into a town and county incorporate, independent of Northumberland. The magi&s;tracy con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, nineteen aldermen, a &s;heriff, a recorder, a town-clerk, a clerk of the chambers, two coroners, eight chamberlains, a &s;word-bearer, with a cap of maintenance, a water-bailiff with a great mace, and &s;even &s;erjeants at mace. Newca&s;tle has been ex|po&s;ed to frequent incur&s;ions and &s;ieges of the Scots, before the union of the two crowns; and in the great rebellion, the army of that kingdom, under the command of Le&s;lie, took it by &s;torm: but it has long ago retrieved all its lo&s;&s;es, and become the great emporium of the north of England for coal and other merchandize. The town is built upon the declivity of a hill, which renders the &s;treets &s;teep and incommodious. The hou&s;es are crowded together &s;o as to exhibit but a di&s;agreeable appearance: yet one or two of the &s;treets are large, &s;pacious, and well paved. The town is overlooked by the old ruinous ca&s;tle: the exchange and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e are magni|ficent buildings, but too clo&s;e to the river; along the bank of which, there is a fine key or wharf faced with free&s;tone, to which &s;hips of ordinary burthen can lay their broad&s;ides, to be loaded or unloaded. But the coal-&s;hips are loaded at or near Shields, &s;even miles farther down the river; their lading being conveyed thither in lighters, which they call keels. The number of the keelmen who work in the&s;e lighters, exceeds &s;ix thou&s;and, who live in a &s;uburb called Sandgate. They have, by a contribution among them&s;elves, built a noble ho&s;|pital for &s;uch of their poor brethren as are di&s;abled by accident, or &s;uperannuated and pa&s;t their labour. The principal church of Newca&s;tle, called St. Ni|cholas, is a &s;tately old fabric, built by David, king of Scotland, with a fine &s;teeple of rare archi|tecture: here are, be&s;ides, &s;ix churches or chapels.
<PB N="270" REF="2780">
We may number among the public edifices, an ele|gant man&s;ion-hou&s;e for the mayor, a noble hall for the &s;urgeons, with a mu&s;eum, a &s;tately infirmary on the model of that at Edinburgh, a library belong|ing to the corporation, a large pri&s;on called New|gate, &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es and charity-&s;chools well endowed. The number of inhabitants amounts to above forty thou&s;and; and many of them are wealthy and live with &s;plendour. They are gene|rally bold, rough, and indu&s;trious, enriching them|&s;elves with the coal trade, and other branches of commerce and manufacture, &s;uch as &s;hip-building, gla&s;s-making, &s;alt-works, and hard-ware, or wrought iron. The place is particularly famous for grind|&s;tones, which are exported to all the countries in Europe. The fa&s;hionable people live in the upper part of the town, at a di&s;tance from the river, where they po&s;&s;e&s;s elegant hou&s;es and gardens, and enjoy them&s;elves at comedies, a&s;&s;emblies, and other po|lite diver&s;ions. The hou&s;es are chiefly built of &s;tone, &s;ome are of brick, and a very few of timber. The revenue of the town, amounting to eight thou&s;and pounds a year, is con&s;iderably larger than that of any other corporation burrough in England; and from this, the mayor is indulged with an annual allowance of &s;ix hundred pounds, be&s;ides the maintenance of a coach, barge, and man&s;ion-hou&s;e.</P>

South Shields is in the bi&s;hopric of Durham, and &s;hall be mentioned in that article. North Shields is the more populous and con&s;iderable, be|ing chiefly inhabited by mariners and &s;hip-ma&s;ters: the &s;treets which lie along the &s;hore are dark, na&s;ty, and narrow, and the hou&s;es make a very mean ap|pearance; yet &s;ome of the inhabitants are wealthy,

and a good number of ve&s;&s;els belong to this vil|lage. Here the river forms a &s;mall bay, which af|fords a very &s;afe anchorage; and in this place four hundred &s;ail of laden &s;hips are &s;ometimes &s;een lying together in three rows, waiting for a fair wind. The harbour and mouth of the Tyne are defend|ed by Tinmouth ca&s;tle, a large fortre&s;s well &s;up|plied with artillery, &s;ituated on a high rock, which, towards the &s;ea on the ea&s;t and north, is counted inacce&s;&s;ible. At the harbour's mouth there is a bar of &s;and, where the river is not more than &s;e|ven feet deep at low water; and on the out&s;ide are the dangerous rocks called the Black Middins: but the&s;e are ea&s;ily avoided by means of light-hou&s;es &s;et up and maintained by Trinity-hou&s;e in New|ca&s;tle. Hard by the&s;e is another ca&s;tle called Clif|ford's fort, which intirely commands the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>Morpeth is a neat little market-town, &s;tanding on the &s;mall river Wentzbeck, about fifteen miles to the northward of Newca&s;tle. It is a burrough by pre&s;cription, belonging to the earl of Carli&s;le, who derives from it the title of vi&s;count: four per&s;ons, being annually cho&s;en by the free bur|ge&s;&s;es, are pre&s;ented to his lord&s;hip's &s;teward, who nominates two of them to be bailiffs, and the&s;e with &s;even aldermen, con&s;titute the magi&s;tracy. Morpeth, lying on a much frequented po&s;t road, is well &s;upplied with inns for the accommodation of travellers. There is a bridge over the river, and an old ca&s;tle in ruins. Here is great plenty of provi&s;ions extremely cheap; and their market for live cattle on Wedne&s;days is, next to that of Smithfield in London, the greate&s;t in all England. Great quantities of corn, provi&s;ions, and cattle, are likewi&s;e &s;old in the Saturdays markets. Va|riety of fi&s;h is brought hither from the &s;ea, of
<PB N="272" REF="2800">
which the town commands a good pro&s;pect: the burrough &s;ends two members to parliament.</P>
<P>Nineteen miles to the northward of Morpeth, we enter Alnwick, a little walled town, &s;eated near the river Alne, neat and cleanly, but chiefly remarkable for the ca&s;tle, which formerly belonged to the family of Percy, and is &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the duke of Northumberland, who has lately ordered it to be repaired and beautified. It was once the mo&s;t noble ca&s;tle in the North of England, and &s;till retains evident marks of its former magnifi|cence. At the &s;iege of this place, Malcolm III. king of Scotland, and his &s;on Edward, lo&s;t their lives by treachery; and in the neighbourhood of Alnwick, king William II. of Scotland was &s;ur|prized and taken in a meadow by &s;ome Engli&s;h ba|rons, who had di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves in the garb and en&s;igns of his people for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To the north-we&s;t of Alnwick ri&s;es that fa|mous ridge of mountains called the Cheviot hills, which &s;eparate Northumberland from Scotland; and are no le&s;s famous for their great height than for the battle celebrated by the ballad of Chevy|cha&s;e. This engagement, more remarkable for the valour and quality than for the number of the combatants, was fought between Percy, known by the epithet of Hot&s;pur, &s;on to the earl of Nor|thumberland, and the Scotti&s;h earl of Douglas, at a place called Otterburn, on the river Rede, near the town of Elle&s;don, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Cheviot hills. Here the&s;e two young warriors and rivals in glory encountered in the reign of Richard II. king of England. Douglas lo&s;t his life in the action; neverthele&s;s, Percy was routed and carried pri&s;oner into Scotland. One of the Che|viot hills, having a level plain on the top, with a pond of water, is &s;o high as to be &s;een at the di&s;|tance of &s;ixty miles in the ea&s;t-riding of York&s;hire.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="2810">
About &s;even miles from Cheviot, is the village of Floddon or Flodden, &s;eated on the river Till, memorable for a bloody battle fought between the Engli&s;h and Scots, in which James IV. of Scot|land was &s;lain with all his prime nobility. This victory, obtained by the earl of Surry, was the more remarkable as king Henry VII. was then abroad with the flower of the Engli&s;h &s;oldiery, engaged in the &s;iege of Tournay.</P>
<P>Berwick is a large fortified town, &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the river Tweed, formerly be|longing to Scotland, capital of the &s;hire, which &s;till retains its name, and one of the four principal towns in which the royal burroughs of Scotland held their conventions. Before the union of the two crowns, it was a perpetual bone of contention between the kingdoms of England and Scotland, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed alternately by both nations; though its &s;trength and beauty are in a great mea&s;ure ow|ing to its Engli&s;h ma&s;ters. Queen Elizabeth, who knew the importance of this frontier, con|tracted it within due compa&s;s, built a noble bridge over the river, connecting it with the county of Northumberland, &s;urrounded it with a &s;tone wall of a&s;hler work, a &s;teep ditch, counter&s;carp, and ba&s;tions, and furni&s;hed it with a numerous artillery. It was &s;trengthened by a ca&s;tle or citadel, which is now in ruins; and the government of it was al|ways conferred on &s;ome nobleman of known cou|rage and integrity, who was at the &s;ame time war|den of the ea&s;tern marches. It was incorporated as a burrough by king James I. and its charter confirmed by act of parliament. At pre&s;ent, it is a large, well-built, populous town, erected into a county, though comprehended in Northumber|land; and in all proclamations expre&s;sly men|tioned as a &s;eparate dominion. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, four bailiffs, and a common
<PB N="274" REF="2820">
council of burge&s;&s;es, and &s;ends two repre&s;entatives to parliament. The &s;treets and hou&s;es are &s;pa|cious and elegant: the place is beautified by a &s;tately church, an exchange, town-hou&s;e, and the noble bridge above-mentioned. At the north|we&s;t end there are hand&s;ome &s;uburbs called the ca&s;tle-gate; and on the &s;outhern end of the bridge is a neat village called Tweedmouth, provided with a church and good inns for travellers. Ber|wick is wholly inhabited by a mixture of Engli&s;h and Scots, who &s;peak a dialect partaking of the languages of both nations, though the Engli&s;h are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Northumberland whurle. Here is an excellent market for corn, fi&s;h, and all &s;orts of provi&s;ion, which are &s;old at very rea&s;onable rates. The people are remarkably in|du&s;trious, employing them&s;elves in the &s;almon fi&s;hery, which is a very advantageous article; and in a manufacture of fine &s;tockings. The greate&s;t defect in this place is the want of a good harbour: for though the tide flows four miles above the town, there is a dangerous bar at the mouth of the har|bour; and the &s;hore without, being bold, &s;teep, and rocky, there is no &s;afe riding in the offing. Berwick gave the title of duke to the natural &s;on of James II. who was attainted by parliament af|ter the revolution, and died a marechal of France, where he had acquired a great character by his mi|litary capacity and &s;ucce&s;s. This town, as a forti|fied pa&s;s, is always garri&s;oned with a regiment of &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Along the &s;hore as far &s;outh as Morpeth, there are &s;everal i&s;lands and rocks that de&s;erve to be mentioned. Of the&s;e, the mo&s;t remarkable is Holy I&s;land, about eight miles from Berwick, &s;o called from the reputed &s;anctity of the monks who here po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a convent. This is the antient Lin|disfarne, the &s;ee of a bi&s;hopric, which was
<PB N="275" REF="2830">
afterwards transferred to Durham. It is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea at high-water; but at the time of ebb, there is a pa&s;&s;age over the &s;and from it to the con|tinent. This i&s;land produces &s;ome corn and rab|bits, and there is plenty of fi&s;h upon the coa&s;t. Here is a neat little town commanded by a &s;mall fort, built upon a ri&s;ing ground to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, with a commodious haven, which is the only &s;afe port between the mouth of the Humber and the Frith of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Seven miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of this harbour, lie the Fearn i&s;lands, which are no other than a clu&s;ter of rocks in the &s;ea, frequented by va&s;t num|bers of &s;ea-fowl: yet here are &s;till to be &s;een the ruins of an old mona&s;tery, a tower, and a light|hou&s;e, maintained for the direction of mariners.</P>
<P>Coquet i&s;land appears &s;eventeen miles farther to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, at the mouth of the river Coquet, from whence the i&s;le derives its name. It was an|tiently famous for a ca&s;tle and a mona&s;tery, which are now in ruins: at pre&s;ent it boa&s;ts of no other buildings than the huts of fi&s;hermen and colliers, who re&s;ort to the i&s;land to dig &s;ea-coal, and catch fi&s;h, of which here is great plenty, with infinite numbers of &s;ea-fowl.</P>
<P>Hexham or Hagut&s;tad, the capital of a di&s;trict called Hexham&s;hire, &s;tanding on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Tyne, about fifteen miles from Newca&s;tle, is a hand&s;ome town and corporation, governed by a bailiff annually elected into that office. It was an|tiently large, wealthy, and magnificent, formed into an epi&s;copal &s;ee in the time of the Saxon hep|tarchy, by Etheldrida, wife to Egfrid, king of Northumberland, in favour of Wilfrid, who had been archbi&s;hop of York: but this dioce&s;e was &s;oon united to that of Lindisfarne. The &s;ame la|dy built at Hexham a &s;tately mona&s;tery, which is &s;aid to have exceeded all the convents on this

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Northumberland abounds with curious monu|ments of Roman, Briti&s;h, and Saxon antiquity, con&s;i&s;ting of the fragments of the vallum and wall, camps and ca&s;tella, altars, urns, coins, and ca&s;tles. At Corbridge, near Hexham, &s;ome gigantic bones were dug up towards the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century; and others of the &s;ame nature at Ailmouth, found &s;o deep in the earth, that they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain there &s;ince the general deluge. In the neigh|bourhood of Warkworth, on the bank of the ri|ver Coquet, is an old hermitage cut out of the &s;o|lid rock, con&s;i&s;ting of a chamber and kitchen, with a chapel and altar. At the village of Fenham near Newca&s;tle, &s;ome coal-pits have been &s;et on fire, and for &s;everal years continued to burn: the flames were vi&s;ible at night, and in the day, the tract of the conflagration was marked by brim&s;tone lying upon the &s;urface of the earth. At Dun&s;tabury ca&s;tle, that &s;tands on the &s;hore between the Fearn and Coquet i&s;lands, the rocks produce a fine &s;par like that of St. Vincent's rock near Bri&s;tol. In Chillingham ca&s;tle, on the river Till, there is a chimney-piece of marble, in the heart of which was found a live toad, when the &s;tone was &s;awed a&s;under.</P>

<HEAD>CUMBERLAND. Its BOUNDARIES and EXTENT, MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Cumberland, or <HI>Cumbria,</HI> &s;o denominated from the Britons, or <HI>Cumri,</HI> who inhabited it, was former|ly the name of a kingdom, which extended from the vallum of Adrian to the city of Dunbritton, now Dumbarton, on the Frith of Clyde, in that part of the i&s;land which was afterwards called Scot|land. At pre&s;ent Cumberland is a county of Eng|land, which gives the title of duke to his royal highne&s;s prince Henry-Frederic, third brother of the reigning king. It is bounded on the north and north-we&s;t by Scotland; on the &s;outh and &s;outh|ea&s;t by part of Lanca&s;hire and We&s;tmoreland; it borders on the ea&s;t with Northumberland and Durham; and on the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t is wa&s;hed by the Iri&s;h &s;ea. The length from north to &s;outh may amount to five and fifty miles; but the breadth does not exceed forty. It is divided into five wards, comprehending one city, fourteen market towns, forty-eight pari&s;h churches, be&s;ides chapels, fourteen thou&s;and eight hundred hou&s;es, and four&s;core thou&s;and inhabitants. The face of
<PB N="278" REF="2860">
the country is diver&s;ified with hill and dale, and, in &s;ome parts of Cumberland, there are very high mountains; &s;uch as Skiddaw, not far from Coker|mouth, counted the highe&s;t hill in England; Wry|no&s;e, near Hawk&s;head, in the northern part of the county, on the top of which we find three &s;hire|&s;tones, &s;o called becau&s;e, though within a foot of each other, they &s;tand in the three counties of Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and Lanca&s;hire; Lan|vellin and Ca&s;tenand, which vie in height with the Skiddaw; Hardknot, on the borders of We&s;t|moreland, from the foot of which the river E&s;ke takes its origin; the mountains of Copland, in the &s;outhern part of the county; the large tract on the ea&s;t &s;ide, known by the denomination of Cro&s;s-Fells, on account of the cro&s;&s;es erected upon them at the fir&s;t planting of Chri&s;tianity in the&s;e parts; the fells of Derwent, and many others, which we need not particularize.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a great number of private plantations, there are divers old fore&s;ts in the county of Cum|berland; &s;uch as Ward fore&s;t near Wigton, Ingle|wood fore&s;t on the banks of the river Peterrel, and the fore&s;t of Copland.</P>
<P>Cumberland is well watered with rivers, meres or lakes, and fountains; but none of its &s;treams are navigable. The mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e are the Derwent, the Eden, the Elne, the E&s;ke, the Leven, the Irthing, and the Peterrel. The Der|went ri&s;es in the vale of Boradale, in the &s;outhern part of the county, among the Derwent fells, and forming a &s;pacious lake, in which there are three &s;mall i&s;lands, pur&s;ues a northern cour&s;e towards the middle of the county, then takes a we&s;tern di|rection, pa&s;&s;es by Cockermouth, and falls into the Iri&s;h &s;ea near Workington, being famous for its fi&s;hery of &s;almon. The Eden, or Ituna of Ptole|mey, is the outlet of the lake called Telle&s;water,
<PB N="279" REF="2870">
on the borders of We&s;tmoreland, famous for pro|ducing the delicious little fi&s;h called char, of the trout &s;pecies: after a northerly cour&s;e of thirty miles, it deviates to the we&s;tward, and, pa&s;&s;ing by Carli&s;le, falls into the frith of Solway, a large in|let of the &s;ea, dividing this part of England from Scotland. The Elne ri&s;es near Jerby, and falls into the &s;ea at Birkby, about four miles to the northward of Workington. The E&s;ke ri&s;es in E&s;kdale, in Scotland, and entering Cumberland, di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the bottom of the Solway frith, which near the &s;ame place likewi&s;e receives the Leven, that ri&s;es in the mountains of Bew, at the northern extremity of the county. The Irthing, following a parallel cour&s;e, is joined by the Cam|bek near Brumpton, and falls into the Eden, at a place called Warwick. The Eden is afterwards &s;welled by the river Peterrel, which runs in a northern direction from Penrith to Weather&s;all.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, MINERAL, VEGETA|BLE, and ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Cumberland is keen and piercing up|on the mountains towards the north, and the cli|mate is moi&s;t as in all other hilly countries, which, at the &s;ame time, abound with wood and water. The &s;oil varies with the face of the country, being barren on the moors and mountains, and fertile in the vallies and level ground bordering upon the &s;ea: in general, the ea&s;tern parts of the &s;hire are barren and de&s;olate; yet even the lea&s;t fertile parts are rich in metals and minerals. The mountains of Copland abound with copper: veins of the &s;ame metal, with a mixture of gold and &s;ilver, were found in the reign of queen Elizabeth among the fells of Derwent; and royal mines were formerly wrought at Ke&s;wick. This county produces great
<PB N="280" REF="2880">
quantities of coal, &s;ome lead, abundance of the mineral earth called black-lead, &s;everal mines of lapis calaminaris, and an incon&s;iderable pearl fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t near Ravengla&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the vegetable productions of this province, here is plenty of grain, wheat, rye, oats, barley, pea&s;e, and beans, with all &s;orts of herbs and roots for the kitchen. The mo&s;t re|markable plants that grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in Cum|berland are the&s;e, the <HI>eruca monen&s;is, laciniata lutea,</HI> the <HI>echium marinum,</HI> the <HI>gladiolus lacu&s;tris dortmanni,</HI> the <HI>orobus &s;ylvaticus,</HI> the <HI>myrtillus grandis,</HI> the <HI>cannibis &s;puria, flore magno albo perelegante,</HI> the <HI>he&s;peris pannonica inodora,</HI> the <HI>orchis palmata pa|lu&s;tris,</HI> the <HI>cyno&s;orchis militaris purpurea ordorata,</HI> the <HI>thla&s;pi minus ceu&s;ij,</HI> the <HI>trogopogon purpureum,</HI> the <HI>virga aurea latifolia &s;errata,</HI> and the <HI>equi&s;etum nudum variegatum minus.</HI></P>
<P>As for the animals, what has been &s;aid of North|umberland may be here repeated. The mountains feed va&s;t numbers of &s;heep; abundance of hor&s;es and black cattle are bred in the pa&s;tures. The farmer's yard is &s;tocked with poultry of all &s;orts, and pidgeons; the hills and lakes afford a great variety of game, &s;uch as foxes, hares, rabbits, black, and moor game, partridge, quail, wood-cocks, &s;nipes, plover, field-fares, teal, widgeon, and wild|ducks. Among the birds of prey, we may reckon a few eagles, hawks, kites, and herons. The rivers, lakes, and &s;treams, afford plenty of &s;almon, trout, char, eels, and flounders; and the &s;ea pours forth a profu&s;ion of excellent fi&s;h: but this ble&s;&s;ing and gift of Providence is in a great mea&s;ure neglect|ed by the inhabitants of Cumberland, who are &s;o &s;atisfied with the productions of the land, that they give very little attention to the fi&s;hery. Agricul|ture is here very well under&s;tood, though the coun|try
<PB N="281" REF="2890">
does not abound with inclo&s;ures. The gentle|men are numerous, opulent, and ho&s;pitable; the yeomen wealthy, and u&s;ed to good living; the common people are hardy, &s;trong, and indu&s;trious, well cloathed, well fed, and lodged in warm com|fortable hou&s;es. Their chief employments are tho&s;e of agriculture, hor&s;e breeding, &s;heep feeding, mining, and the colliery; and there are &s;ome good mariners in the &s;ea-ports of the county. Among a great number of elegant &s;eats in Cumberland, we &s;hall only take notice of Drumburgh-ca&s;tle, on the Solway frith, belonging to the duke of Nor|folk; the earl of Egremont's ca&s;tle at Cokermouth; the earl of Carli&s;le's at Naworth, ten miles from Carli&s;le; that of the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, at Kirko&s;wald, thirteen miles from Carli&s;le; and Dacre's ca&s;tle, belonging to the &s;ame nobleman, about four miles from Penrith. All the&s;e are venerable buildings, rai&s;ed as places of &s;trength, before the union of the Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h crowns; at pre&s;ent little re|garded for aught but their antiquity and romantic &s;ituation.</P>

<P>We have already mentioned in our account of Northumberland, the remains of the Roman wall that ran from &s;ea to &s;ea, beginning at Boulne&s;s, at the mouth of the river Eden, in this county, and ending at Cou&s;in's hou&s;e, about three miles to the ea&s;tward of Newca&s;tle. Con&s;idering the ca&s;tella and &s;tationary camps, which the Romans were obliged to maintain in this neighbourhood for the defence of the barrier, there mu&s;t be a great num|ber of antient monuments in Cumberland; accord|ingly, there is &s;carce a family of any note in the county, that does not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome altar or &s;tone with a Latin in&s;cription.</P>

<P>Carli&s;le, in Latin Carleolum, is a &s;mall, but thriving city, in the north of England, &s;ituated about three hundred miles from London, in the fore&s;t of Ingle&s;wood, at the di&s;tance of &s;even miles from the border of Scotland. It was &s;ecured with a citadel or ca&s;tle, and fortified with walls and turrets as a barrier again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Scots, who were always trouble&s;ome neigh|bours to England. Carli&s;le is delightfully &s;ituated between the conflux of three fine rivers, namely the Eden, the Peterrel, and the Lunda; and was of old one of the Roman &s;tations. Though it &s;uffered greatly at different periods during the wars that raged almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly between the two kingdoms, the monarchs of England, &s;ince the reign of William Rufus, paid particular atten|tion to this frontier, and always kept the fortifi|cations in repair, until &s;uch precautions were ren|dered unnece&s;&s;ary by the union. The walls, how|ever, are &s;till &s;tanding, and the ca&s;tle is garri&s;oned by invalids. The hou&s;es are commodious and well built, the inhabitants wealthy, and trade chiefly in fu&s;tians, of which there is a con&s;iderable manufacture in the place. The number of the people does not exceed two thou&s;and: they are governed by a mayor, two &s;heriffs or bailiffs, twelve aldermen, twice that number of common-council-men, or capital burge&s;&s;es, a recorder and chamberlain, with a &s;word-bearer and mace-bearer.

The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of a dean, four canons, eight minor canons, a deacon, a &s;ubdeacon, four lay-clerks, &s;ix choiri&s;ters, and as many alm&s;men. To the u&s;e of this chapter, the tythes of the whole city are ap|propriated, and both churches being curacies, are &s;upplied by two of the minor canons, nominated by the dean and majority. People in digging within the city, as well as in ploughing up the adjacent fields, have found antient pavements, foundations of hou&s;es, arches, and doors, coins, urns, and other antiquities. At the village of Netherby, on the &s;ide of the E&s;k, not far from Carli&s;le, there is a great appearance of ruins, which appear to have been &s;ome con&s;iderable city, probably the old Oe&s;eca of the Romans. A great many antient in&s;criptions have been found in this place, and the neighbourhood. During the rebellion in the year 1745, a party of During the rebellion in the year 1745, a party of the rebels were left in Carli&s;le, when the young pretender retreated to Scotland; and the town be|ing inve&s;ted by his late royal highne&s;s the duke of Cumberland, they &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion, after having made &s;ome &s;hew of defence. At Row|cliff, near the &s;ea-&s;hore, is an old ca&s;tle, formerly belonging to the lords Dacres. At Sollommo&s;s, a little farther to the northward of the Oe&s;turia or Frith, the Scots were routed by the Engli&s;h in the year 1542. At a little di&s;tance from hence, the E&s;k receives the &s;mall river Kirk&s;op, which is the
<PB N="284" REF="2930">
boundary between England and Scotland. Near to Bew ca&s;tle, which &s;tands upon the Leven, there is in a church-yard a cro&s;s of one intire &s;tone about five yards high, with a Dani&s;h in&s;cription, by which it appears to be a &s;epulchral monument. In the tract of the Roman wall, on the &s;outh-&s;ide of the Oe&s;tuary, is the &s;mall town of Burgh on the Sands, famous for the death of king Edward I. who ex|pired in this place, on his march at the head of a great army, with which he intended to extirpate the Scotti&s;h nation: finding his end approaching, he gave directions that his &s;on &s;hould proceed with the expedition, and carry his corp&s;e along with him in|to Scotland as a &s;ure pledge of victory. The &s;pot on which this great prince fetched his la&s;t breath is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a large &s;quare pillar eight and twenty feet high, with Latin in&s;criptions on the dif|ferent &s;ides, &s;pecifying the death of Edward; and that this monument was erected to his memory in the year 1685, by Henry Howard, duke of Nor|folk, earl mar&s;hal of England, and earl of Arun|del.</P>
<P>Cockermouth is a populous market-town, at the di&s;tance of twenty miles to the &s;outhward of Car|li&s;le, &s;ituated at the conflux of the rivers Derwent and Coker, between two hills, on one of which &s;tands the church, and on the other, an old ea&s;tle of great &s;trength belonging to the duke of Northum|berland. The town is well built, the hou&s;es being of &s;tone covered with &s;late; and through the middle of it runs the Coker, over which there are two hand|&s;ome &s;tone bridges. The chief magi&s;trate of this burrough is a bailiff, annually cho&s;en by &s;ixteen burghers at the court held by the duke of Northum|berland. It &s;ends members to parliament, though it is not a corporation, and enjoys a con&s;iderable trade by means of a commodious harbour. In the neighbourhood of Cockermouth we &s;ee the ruins
<PB N="285" REF="2940">
of Pap-ca&s;tle, which appears, by &s;everal monu|ments, to be of Roman antiquity. Here was found a large open ve&s;&s;el of green &s;tone, exhibiting &s;eve|ral little images carved upon the margins, and a Dani&s;h in&s;cription, by which we learn that it was a font for bapti&s;m. It is &s;till u&s;ed for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e in the neighbouring church of Bridkirk.</P>
<P>Ravengla&s;s is a &s;mall neat market-town, &s;ituated at the conflux of the rivers E&s;ke and Mute, where they fall into the &s;ea, near the &s;outhern extremity of the county: but this river E&s;ke, which ri&s;es from the mountain called Hardknot-hill, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed in the reader's memory from the ri|ver of the &s;ame name that di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Solway Frith, at the oppo&s;ite end of the county. Two thirds of Ravengla&s;s is &s;urrounded by the E&s;ke and the Mute, which form a tolerable harbour commodious for trade, and the fi&s;hery, which is here very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Egremont is a &s;mall town &s;eated on the river Broadwater, over which there are two bridges. It &s;tands at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea, about nine miles to the ea&s;tward of Ravengla&s;s, and enjoys the convenience of a &s;mall harbour for boats. It was formerly famous for a ca&s;tle of the &s;ame name belonging to the family of Percy; and at pre&s;ent gives the title of earl to that of Wyndham, in con|&s;equence of his lord&s;hip's being de&s;cended from the la&s;t heire&s;s of that honourable hou&s;e, who e&s;pou&s;ed Charles, duke of Somer&s;et.</P>
<P>Whitehaven lying on the &s;ame coa&s;t, a little far|ther to the northward, is a large, populous, flou|ri&s;hing market-town, receiving its name from a white rock &s;tanding on the we&s;t-&s;ide, and the haven, which is &s;afe and convenient. This harbour has been greatly improved, and the town beautified and enlarged by the family of Sir James Lowther, who, from this port exports annually to Ireland

and the I&s;le of Man, as much coal from his own e&s;tate, as brings him in a revenue of twenty thou|&s;and pounds. Whitehaven is the mo&s;t eminent port in England for the coal trade, next to Newca&s;tle; and the increa&s;e of &s;hipping is &s;o great, that after a tract of contrary winds, it is not unu&s;ual to &s;ee two hundred &s;hips &s;et &s;ail at once from the harbour. The inhabitants likewi&s;e deal in &s;alt, &s;ugars, to|bacco, and other branches of commerce. It anci|ently belonged to St. Bees, a little village on the &s;ea &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of two miles to the &s;outhward, which is &s;aid to have derived its name from an Iri&s;h female &s;aint called St. Bega, who per|formed &s;ome miracles, and founded a nunnery on the &s;pot. Certain it is, there was a Benedictine priory founded by William de Mi&s;chines, brother of Ranulph, fir&s;t earl of Cumberland. At pre&s;ent, it is remarkable for nothing but a grammar-&s;chool with a library, founded by Edmund Grindal, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was a native of the place, and &s;ince improved by the munificence of di|vers benefactors of the clergy as well as laity. Here is good anchoring ground and &s;afe riding for ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of Whitehaven, nearly at the &s;ame di&s;tance, there is a convenient harbour by the village of More&s;by; and here, as well as in every other landing-place along this part of the &s;hore, we find ruins of antient fortifications, rai&s;ed by the Romans to defend the coa&s;t from the naval arma|ments of the Scots and Iri&s;h. In and about this village, the inhabitants have di&s;covered many an|tient foundations, vaults, and caverns; and dug up &s;everal &s;tones with Latin in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Ke&s;wick is a &s;mall market-town, &s;eated on the &s;ide of a lake in a fertile plain, about eight miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Cockermouth, near the mountain of Skiddaw. It was formerly famous for its royal

<P>Jerby, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Arbeia of the antients, is a market-town on the river Elen, noted for little el&s;e than its antiquity.</P>
<P>Ellenborough, &s;tanding at the mouth of the &s;ame river, is now a paltry village; but in this neigh|bourhood, &s;eated upon a ri&s;ing ground, &s;tands the Roman town of Olenaen, where the fir&s;t Herculean wing kept garri&s;on in the reign of Theodo&s;ius the Younger. In this place, many curious antiquities have been di&s;covered, &s;uch as altars, monuments, &s;tatues, and images. Curio&s;ities of the &s;ame kind have been found in the highway at Wigton, a &s;mall market-town a little farther north, in the fore&s;t of Allerdale; a tract of country which formerly be|longed to Henry, earl of Carli&s;le, &s;on of David, king of Scotland, a pious and magnificent prince, who here founded the abbey of Ulm or Holm-Cul|trame. This mona&s;tery &s;tood at the bottom of a bay, and the famous mathematician Michael Scot was one of the monks who here re&s;ided. At the di&s;tance of a few miles to the ea&s;tward of Holm-Cultrame, we find the ruins of an antient city, vul|garly called Old Carli&s;le; in all probability, the re|mains of the Roman &s;tation which Antoninus di&s;|tingui&s;hes by the name of <HI>Ca&s;tra Exploratorum;</HI> as it an&s;wers to the di&s;tance he a&s;&s;igns from thence

<P>Penrith, which in the old Briti&s;h language &s;igni|fies a red head or red hill, the ground in this neigh|bourhood, and the &s;tone being of a reddi&s;h hue, is a large well built market-town, &s;eated on a hill called Penrith-fell, on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of the county, upon the banks of the river Eden, not far from its &s;ource. It was formerly defended by a ca&s;tle, which is now in ruins. The place is adorned with a large commodious market-hou&s;e, exhibiting the figures of bears climbing up ragged &s;taffs, the device of the antient earls of Warwick; and here is a &s;tately church, on the north-&s;ide of which appear two pyramidal pillars, about four yards high, and five yards a&s;under, believed by the vulgar to be the &s;epulchral monument of one Sir Owen Cae&s;arius, a gigantic warrior of old, who is &s;aid to have killed a number of wild boars that infe&s;ted the country, and harboured in the fore&s;t of Englewood. Pen|rith is populous and wealthy, reckoned the &s;econd town of the county for trade and opulence, parti|cularly noted for tanners. It has a good corn market every week, and another much more con&s;i|derable for cattle, held once a fortnight, from Whit&s;unday to the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t. In the neigh|bourhood of the town appear the ruins of an an|cient city, which, though vulgarly denominated old Penrith, is &s;uppo&s;ed by the learned to be the Roman <HI>Petrianae,</HI> becau&s;e it appears by an old in|&s;cription found in the place, that the <HI>ala petriana</HI> was here quartered on the banks of the Eden. Near Penrith there is a grotto con&s;i&s;ting of two rooms hewn out of a rock, to which the acce&s;s is very dif|ficult. In all probability, this was a place of &s;trength and &s;ecurity in former times: for it was
<PB N="289" REF="2980">
provided with iron gates, which remained &s;tanding not many years ago. On the &s;ame river Eden, a little farther to the northward, we &s;ee a Dani&s;h mo|nument of &s;eventy-&s;even &s;tones, each ten feet high, &s;tanding in form of a circle, and one before the entrance, fifteen feet in height; within the circle are two heaps of &s;tones, or tumuli, &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome authors to be places of burial, and by others, to be rude heaps, gathered off the ploughed lands, and thrown together in this place, as in a wa&s;te corner of the field. The common people di&s;tin|gui&s;h the circle by the appellation of Long Meg and her daughters.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame river Eden, more northerly, &s;tands the &s;mall town of Kirk O&s;wald, &s;o called, becau&s;e it was dedicated to St. O&s;wald, remarkable for no|thing but an old ca&s;tle, which is now in ruins. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame river, are the ca&s;tles of Ar|manthwaite, belonging to the Skeltons; Corby, to the Salkelds, who are likewi&s;e owners of War|wick, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Viro&s;idum of the Romans, where there is a bridge thrown over the river; Lin|&s;tock, appertaining to the bi&s;hopric of Carli&s;le; and Wetheral, a little town, where was formerly a &s;mall mona&s;tery, in the neighbourhood of which we find &s;everal hermitages cut out of a rock. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, we may reckon the ca&s;tle of Gray&s;tock, hard by Penrith, the property of the duke of Nor|folk; and Ro&s;e-ca&s;tle, a beautiful &s;eat belonging to the bi&s;hops of Carli&s;le, upon the edge of Ward fore&s;t, wa&s;hed by the &s;mall river Canda.</P>
<P>Brampton is a &s;mall market-town, hard by the wall of Severus, near the northern extremity of Cumberland, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Brematuracum of the Romans, where the fir&s;t cohort of the Tungri, from Germany, was quartered.

<P>We&s;tmoreland is a &s;mall inland county, bound|ed on the ea&s;t by part of York&s;hire, and the bi&s;hop|ric of Durham; on the &s;outh by Lanca&s;hire; and on the we&s;t and north by Cumberland. It extends thirty miles in length, and four and twenty in breadth, comprehending thirty-two pari&s;hes, eight market-towns, a con&s;iderable number of villages, about &s;even thou&s;and hou&s;es, and about five and thirty thou&s;and inhabitants. It is divided into the two great baronies of We&s;tmoreland and Kendal; the former belonging to the dioce&s;e of Carli&s;le, and the latter to the bi&s;hopric of Che&s;ter. It was of old inhabited by the Brigantes; it afterwards con|&s;tituted part of the Northumbrian kingdom; and now gives title of earl to the noble family of Fane.</P>

<P>We&s;tmoreland is one of the mo&s;t mountainous countries in England, particularly the barony of Kendal, which abounds in hills and fells, moors and rocks, be&s;ides the great ridge of mountains
<PB N="291" REF="3000">
that &s;eparate this province from York&s;hire. Among the mountains of this county, one of the mo&s;t re|markable is called I&s;anparles, extremely high and difficult of acce&s;s, famous for being, as it were, &s;cooped into divers caverns and labyrinths, which &s;eem to have been formed as retreats in times of trouble and calamity. The county produces plenty of wood, both on the mountains and plains, e&s;pe|cially on the ridges of the river Lone and the Winander-mere; and in the fore&s;ts of Whinfield, on the penin&s;ula between the rivers Eimot and Eden; in that of Martindale, extending the whole length of Ulles water; as well as in tho&s;e of Thornth|waite, Maller&s;land, Melborn, and Meldon, be|&s;ides a great number of parks and plantations.</P>
<P>The large&s;t lake in England is the Winander|mere of this county, lying among the mountains on the borders of Cumberland, &s;tretching ten miles in length, of a very con&s;iderable depth, having a rocky bottom, &s;tudded with &s;everal ver|dant i&s;les or holmes, and abounding with the deli|cate fi&s;h called char, which, being potted and pre|&s;erved, is &s;ent in pre&s;ents from hence to all parts of England. It is &s;welled by the &s;mall rivers Ruthey and Brathey, which fall into it, and by its commu|nication with a chain of &s;mall lakes called Gre&s;mere. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable rivers of this county are the Eden, the Can, the Lone, and the Loder. The Eden, or Ituna, we have already de&s;cribed in our account of Cumberland, between which and We&s;t|moreland it runs, forming part of the boundary. The Can, Ken, or Kent, deriving its origin from the &s;mall lake called Kent-mere, in the neighbour|hood of Amble&s;ide, is, by the addition of two large brooks, &s;welled into a con&s;iderable &s;tream before it arrives at Kendal; after a brawling and rugged cour&s;e among rocks, it falls into the &s;ea on the bor|ders of Lanca&s;hire. It abounds with fi&s;h, and
<PB N="292" REF="3010">
is remarkable for two cataracts at Levens and Betham. The Lone, or Lune, ri&s;es near Maller&s;|land fore&s;t, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the county, giving name to the tract called Lon&s;dale. Being &s;welled by &s;everal rivulets, and the two &s;mall rivers Birk|beck and Burrow, it becomes a con&s;iderable &s;tream near Howgill, runs in a &s;outhern direction parallel to the borders of York&s;hire, waters Kirkby Lon&s;|dale, enters Lanca&s;hire, and joining the river Kend|born, falls into the &s;ea at Overton. The Loder, or Lowther, is a pure tran&s;parent &s;tream, taking its ri&s;e from the Broad-water, near I hornth waite|hall, in the north-we&s;t part of the county, and falling into the river Eimot at Penrith. This river hath given the name to the antient family of Lowther.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, WATER, PRODUCTIONS, MINERALS, VEGETABLES, ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The air of We&s;tmoreland is keen and &s;alubrious; but the climate is moi&s;t, con&s;equently not very agreeable. With re&s;pect to fertility, the barony of Kendal is mountainous, therefore not &s;o fit for tillage as for pa&s;ture: but the other part, properly called We&s;tmoreland, is an open champaign coun|try, which, if well cultivated, would be fruitful in both. Be&s;ides the water of the common fountains and rivers, which is pure, agreeable, and fit for all the u&s;ual purpo&s;es, this county affords &s;ome &s;prings of peculiar qualities. In Betham-park there is the Dropping-well, in which mo&s;s, wood, and leaves are petrified. On the north &s;ide of Jeffrey|mount there is a &s;mall &s;pring called Goud&s;ike, which continually throws up &s;mall &s;pangles that glitter like &s;ilver. In the neighbourhood of Burrow, up|on Stanemore, the inhabitants have di&s;covered a chalybeate fountain.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="3020">
In all probability, the mountains of We&s;tmore|land are well &s;tored with minerals, though no mines are worked in this county: yet here is plenty of coal for fuel. The county produces con&s;idera|ble crops of corn and hay, together with many plants not commonly found in the neighbouring provinces: among the&s;e we reckon <HI>Adianthum per|pu&s;illum foliis bifidis, allium montanum flore purpureo, bi&s;toria minima, cera&s;us avium, cera&s;us minimus &s;yl|ve&s;tris fructu cordiformi, chamaecy&s;tus folio pelo&s;ellae, gentian lla verna &s;eu precox, geranium flore varie|gato, geranium montanum,</HI> different genera of the <HI>filex.

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>We&s;tmoreland exhibits &s;ome monuments of Ro|man, as well as of Briti&s;h antiquity.

Brough under Stanemore, imagined to be the antient Verterae, is &s;ituated on a Roman highway. At Whelp-ca&s;tle, near Kirkby Thore, appear the ruins of an old town, thought to be Gal|latum, where we &s;ee con&s;iderable remains of anti|quity. Hard by Kirkby Thore begins the old cau&s;eway, called the Maiden way, which runs
<PB N="294" REF="3030">
about twenty miles from hence to Caer-vorran, in the neighbourhood of the great wall. Near the conflux of the Lowther and Eimot, there is a cir|cular mound, known by the appellation of <HI>Arthur's round table,</HI> &s;ecured on the in&s;ide by a trench, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a kind of li&s;ts, or amphithe|atre, for tournament or wre&s;tling. Hard by this monument, there is a heap of rude &s;tones piled up in form of a hor&s;e&s;hoe, called Mayburgh, where a peace is &s;aid to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the tenth century, between Athel&s;tan, king of Northum|berland, Con&s;tantine, king of Scotland, and divers other princes. Near Whelp-ca&s;tle we &s;ee the re|mains of ditches, ramparts, and mounds of earth, among which &s;everal &s;tones have been found with Roman in&s;criptions. There are be&s;ides divers re|mains of Saxon and Dani&s;h monuments. In the northern part of the county we &s;ee a pillar erected, with an in&s;cription by Anne, counte&s;s dowager of Pembroke, in memory of her parting at this place from her mother the counte&s;s dowager of Cumber|land, in the year 1616.</P>

<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>We&s;tmoreland is too mountainous to be full of people: neverthele&s;s, the level country is well in|habited by a &s;tout, rugged, hardy race, who are either employed in breeding and feeding &s;heep and cattle, in coal-digging, or in the woollen manufac|ture of cloths and &s;tockings. The farmers are either poorer, or le&s;s &s;kilful in agriculture here, than in any other county of England: for there are very few inclo&s;ures, except tho&s;e belonging to noblemen and gentlemen of fortune, and tho&s;e we &s;ee are made with loo&s;e &s;tones, without lime or mortar. This nakedne&s;s of the country, however, gives the better effect to the &s;eats of the gentry, of which
<PB N="295" REF="3040">
there is a con&s;iderable number in this di&s;trict, ele|gant and delightful. Among the&s;e we reckon Pendragon-ca&s;tle, about twelve miles from Apple|by, belonging to the earl of Thanet, hereditary &s;heriff of the county: Beltham-ca&s;tle, at the di&s;tance of &s;even miles from Kendal, a &s;eat of the earl of Derby; and Lowther hall, near Ulles water, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the lord vi&s;count Lon&s;dale.

<HEAD>TOWNS and PLACES.</HEAD>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable places in We&s;tmoreland are Appleby, Shap, Kirkby Stephen, Orton, Am|ble&s;ide, Kendal, Kirkby Lon&s;dale, Burton, and Milthorpe. Appleby, the Aballaba of the Ro|mans, is now an incon&s;iderable market-town, built in a Roman military road &s;till vi&s;ible, &s;ituated in an agreeable plain, on the banks of the river Eden. It was even after the conque&s;t a place of con&s;iderable note, favoured by the kings of Eng|land with immunities equal to tho&s;e of the city of York: at pre&s;ent, however, nothing of its antient &s;plendour remains, nor is it important for any thing but the a&s;&s;izes, which are held in the town-hall, and a con&s;iderable weekly market for corn. The hou&s;es are generally mean, and the place is thinly inha|bited; but it &s;till boa&s;ts of one &s;pacious &s;treet run|ning from north to &s;outh, with an ea&s;y a&s;cent, at the top of which &s;tands the ca&s;tle belonging to the earl of Thanet, almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the river. At the lower end of the town appears the only re|maining church, and hard by is a &s;chool hou&s;e, built by Robert Langton, and &s;ince endowed by Dr. Thomas Smith, bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, and other

<P>Amble&s;ide is al&s;o a market-town, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the county, near Winander-mere, &s;upported by the cloth manufacture, and well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions.

<P>Kendal, Candale, deriving its name from the river Can, on the banks of which it is &s;ituated, and over which the inhabitants have thrown three bridges, is a large trading town towards the &s;outh edge of the county, ruled by a mayor, twelve al|dermen, and twenty-four burge&s;&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting of two large &s;treets cro&s;&s;ing each other. Here are &s;everal trading companies, namely, mercers, &s;heer|men, cordwainers, tanners, glovers, taylors, and pewterers; and each of the&s;e has a hall, where they a&s;&s;emble. The church is large and &s;pacious; but the inhabitants are &s;o numerous, that it is found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to have twelve chapels be&s;ides. Near the church is a free &s;chool, well endowed. At a little di&s;tance from one of the bridges, which is of wood, we &s;ee the ruins of an old ca&s;tle, the birth place of Katharine Par, the la&s;t wife of king Henry VIII. At Kendal a great weekly market is held on Saturdays. The people are wealthy and indu&s;trious, employing them&s;elves in different branches of the woollen ma|nufacture, which was here e&s;tabli&s;hed by certain Flemings as far back as the reign of Edward III. who encouraged them to &s;ettle here, as well as at Colche&s;ter in E&s;&s;ex.

<HEAD>LANCASHIRE. Its SITUATION and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>The county palatine of Lanca&s;ter is a large ma|ritime province, wa&s;hed by the Iri&s;h &s;ea on the we&s;t, bordering on the north with part of Cumber|land and We&s;tmoreland, bounded on the ea&s;t by the We&s;t Riding of York&s;hire, and on the we&s;t by Che&s;hire, extending forty-five miles in length from north to &s;outh, and thirty-two miles in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t; comprehending &s;ix hundreds, &s;ixty pari&s;hes, twenty-&s;even market towns, and about two hundred and forty thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, RIVERS, LAKES, FOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The ea&s;tern parts of the province are rocky, and in the northern di&s;tricts we &s;ee many &s;ingle moun|tains remarkably high, &s;uch as Ingleborough-hill,
<PB N="299" REF="3080">
Cloughbo-hill, Pendle-hill, and Longridge-hill. Nor is there any want of wood in this county, either for timber or fuel; witne&s;s Wier&s;dale fore&s;t and Bowland fore&s;t, to the northward, and Simon's wood in the &s;outhern part of Lanca&s;hire.</P>
<P>This county is well watered with rivers and lakes. Among the former we number the Mer&s;ey, the Ribble, the Wire, the Lon, the Ken, and the Irke. The Mer&s;ey &s;prings among the mountains of Derby|&s;hire, is &s;welled by &s;everal &s;treams, winds along the borders of Lanca&s;hire, which it divides from Che&s;hire, and runs into the &s;ea at Liverpool. The Ribble, ri&s;ing in York&s;hire, enters this county at Clithero, wa&s;hes the town of Pre&s;ton, and having received the &s;maller &s;treams of the Hadder, the Whalley, the Darwent, and the Lea, di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Iri&s;h &s;ea at Lethum. The Wire is a continuation of the Calder, which derives its &s;ource from the fore&s;t of Wier&s;dale, in the northern part of the county, and being augmented by divers &s;maller &s;treams, runs into the &s;ea at Cokerham. The Lon, and the Ken or Can, we have already de|&s;cribed in our account of We&s;tmoreland. The Irke is an incon&s;iderable rivulet, that forms the beginning of the Irwel and Mer&s;ey, which are its continuations; and is noted for producing the fatte&s;t eels in England.</P>
<P>Among the lakes or meres of Lanca&s;hire, we reckon the Winander-mere, already mentioned in the article of We&s;tmoreland, the Kening&s;ton-mere, which though neither &s;o large nor &s;o well &s;tored with fi&s;h, yet affords plenty of excellent char, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a kind of Alpine trout. There was on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Ribble another lake called Marton, &s;everal miles in circumference, which is now drain|ed, and converted into pa&s;ture ground. In this operation, the workmen found a great quantity of fi&s;h, together with eight canoes, re&s;embling tho&s;e

of America, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been u&s;ed by the antient Briti&s;h fi&s;hermen. Be&s;ides the&s;e meres or lakes, this county abounds with mora&s;&s;es and mo&s;&s;es, from which the inhabitants dig excellent peat or turf for fuel, as well as marle for manuring the ground, and trunks of old fir trees, &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain there &s;ince the general deluge. Some of the&s;e are &s;o impregnated with turpentine, that when divided into &s;plinters, they burn like candles, and are u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e by the common people. There is a great variety of mineral waters in this county, &s;ome periodical &s;prings, and one in&s;tance of a violent eruption of water at Kirk by in Fourne&s;s. The mo&s;t remarkable chalybeate &s;paws are tho&s;e of Latham Wigan, Stockport, Burnley, Bolton, Plumpton, Middleton, Strangeways, Lanca&s;ter, Larbrick, and Chorly. At Ancliff, in the neighbourhood of Wigan, is a fountain called the Burning Well, from whence a bituminous vapour exhales, which being &s;et on fire by a candle burns like brandy, &s;o as to produce a degree of heat that will boil eggs to a hard con&s;i&s;tence, while the water it&s;elf retains its origi|nal coldne&s;s. There is at Barton a fountain of &s;alt|water, &s;o &s;trongly impregnated with the mineral, as to yield &s;ix times as much as can be extracted from the &s;ame quantity of &s;ea water. At Rogham, in Fourne&s;s, there is a purging &s;aline fountain; and in the neighbourhood of Ra&s;&s;al, where the ground is frequently overflowed by the &s;ea, a &s;tream de|&s;cends from Hagbur-hills, which, in the &s;pace of &s;even years, is &s;aid to convert the marle into a hard free&s;tone fit for building.</P>

<P>The air of Lanca&s;hire is pure, healthy, and agreeable, except among the fens and on the &s;ea|&s;hore,
<PB N="301" REF="3100">
where the atmo&s;phere is loaded with putrid exhalations producing malignant and intermitting fevers, &s;curvy, rheumati&s;m, drop&s;y, and con&s;ump|tion. The &s;oil is various in different parts of the county, poor and rocky on the hills, fat and fer|tile in the valleys, and champaign country. The colour of the peat is white, grey, or black, ac|cording to the nature of the compo&s;ition and the degree of putrefaction which the ingredients have undergone. There is a bituminous earth about Orm&s;kirk, that &s;mells like the oil of amber, and indeed yields an oil of the &s;ame nature, both in its &s;cent and medicinal effects, which moreover re|duces raw fle&s;h to the con&s;i&s;tence of mummy: this earth burns like a torch, and is u&s;ed as &s;uch by the country people. The metals and minerals of this county con&s;i&s;t of lead, iron, copper, antimony, black lead, lapis calaminaris, &s;par, green vitriol, allum, &s;ulphur, pyrites, free&s;tone, coal, and can|nel, which is of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but burns much clearer, is capable of receiving a fine poli&s;h, and often formed into &s;nuff-boxes, cups, and candle|&s;ticks.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to vegetables, Lanca&s;hire does not fall &s;hort of any Engli&s;h county which we have de&s;cribed. The level country produces plenty of wheat and barley; and the &s;kirts of the hills yield good harve&s;ts of excellent oats: very good hemp is rai&s;ed in divers parts of the province; and the pa&s;ture which grows in the vallies, is &s;o peculiarly rich, that the cattle which feed upon it are much larger and fatter than in any other part of England.</P>
<P>Among the remarkable vegetables of this coun|ty, we reckon the <HI>chamaemorus,</HI> a kind of dwarf mulberry that grows on the top of Pendle-hill; the <HI>a&s;phodelus Lanca&s;triae verus,</HI> with the flower of which the women u&s;ed to colour their hair; the <HI>bi|folium minimum</HI> found among the heath on different

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Lanca&s;hire was erected into a county-palatine by Edward III. who conferred it as an appenage on his &s;on John of Ghaunt, thence called duke of Lan|ca&s;ter: but the dutchy contained lands that are not in Lanca&s;hire, and among other deme&s;nes, the pa|lace of the Savoy, and all that di&s;trict in London,
<PB N="303" REF="3120">
which indeed belong to it at this day. The reve|nues of this dutchy are admini&s;tered by a court which &s;its at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and a chancery court at Pre&s;ton, which has a &s;eal di&s;tinct from that of the county-palatine. The title of Lanca&s;ter di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the po&s;terity of John of Ghaunt from tho&s;e of his brother, who &s;ucceeded to the dutchy of York, in their long and bloody conte&s;t for the crown of England.</P>

<P>Lanca&s;ter, the county-town, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Longovicum of the antients, is &s;ituated on the &s;outh bank of the Lon, near its mouth, and is provided with a &s;tately bridge over this river, con&s;i&s;ting of five arches. It has likewi&s;e a ca&s;tle, where the a&s;|&s;izes are held; and part of it is converted into a pri|&s;on. The town is governed by a mayor, recorder, &s;even aldermen, two bailiffs, four and twenty burge&s;&s;es, and a town-clerk. The burge&s;&s;es were favoured by king John with all the privileges he had before granted to tho&s;e of Bri&s;tol; and Ed|ward III. gave them the power to hold the &s;e&s;&s;ions of the county. They have a market every Wed|ne&s;day and Saturday, and three annual fairs, April 20, June 24, and September 29. Every &s;econd Wedne&s;day throughout the year, is a market for cattle. As the harbour admits of pretty large ve&s;|&s;els, there is a con&s;iderable commerce carried on from thence to our colonies in America: they ex|port hardware and woollen manufactures; and make returns of &s;ugar and rum. This traffic em|ploys

<P>Pre&s;ton is &s;ituated upon the Ribble, which plen|tifully &s;upplies it with fi&s;h, and over which there is an ample &s;tone bridge. This town is governed by a mayor, recorder, eight aldermen, four under aldermen, &s;eventeen common-council men, and a town-clerk. It is &s;ituated on an agreeable emi|nence, large, airy, well-built, and exten&s;ive; has three markets in the week, and five annual fairs. The officers belonging to the chancery of the coun|ty palatine of Lanca&s;ter re&s;ide in this town, and a good deal of other company, who give the place an air of gaiety. There are hor&s;e-races in the neighbourhood; and the town is remarkable for having every years a jubilee, to which great numbers of people re&s;ort from different parts of the kingdom. The town was incorporated by Henry II. and its privileges were confirmed by &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchs. It has a charity-&s;chool well endowed. The place is famous for the defeat of duke Hamilton in the year 1648, when he marched hither with an army of Scots to deliver king Charles I. from his impri&s;onment. Here al|&s;o the rebels were attacked and &s;urrendered to the king's troops in the year 1715, on the very day that the duke of Argyle fought the battle of Dum|blaine in Scotland. On the whole, tho' Pre&s;ton is not remarkable for commerce, it is an agreeable retreat, abounding with excellent provi&s;ions and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, which may be had on very ea&s;y terms, every article of hou&s;e-keeping being much cheaper here than in many other parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Newton is an ancient borough governed by a &s;teward, bailiff, and burge&s;&s;es. It has no market, but four annual fairs; and its two members of par|liament are returned by the &s;teward of the lord of

<P>Wigan, or Wiggin, is a hand&s;ome town &s;tand|ing near the &s;ource of the rivulet Dugle&s;s: it was erected into a corporation by king Henry I. go|verned by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, and two bailiffs; has two markets in the week, and three annual fairs.

The place is populous, and drives a con&s;iderable trade in the manufacture of coverlets, blankets, rugs, as well as pit-coal and iron-work.</P>
<P>Clithero is an ancient borough by pre&s;cription, governed by two bailiffs: it &s;tands at the bottom of Penrith-hill, not far from the ri&s;e of the Rib|ble; has a market every Saturday, and three an|nual fairs. There are hor&s;e-races frequent on the adjacent moor; but, on the whole, the place is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Liverpool, Litherpool, or Lirpool, is a flou|ri&s;hing &s;ea-port, &s;ituated at the mouth of the river Mer&s;ee, which abounds with &s;almon, cod-fi&s;h, turbot, plaice, &s;melts, and flounders, and at high water is above two miles over. The town, which was incorporated by king John, is governed by a mayor, recorder, aldermen without limitation, forty common-council men, and burge&s;&s;es, the number of whom exceeds fifteen hundred. The freemen of Liverpool have the &s;ame privileges at Bri&s;tol, in England, and at Waterford and Wex|ford, in Ireland. Here are markets on Wedne&s;|day and Saturday, and every &s;econd Wedne&s;day there is a market for all kinds of cattle. Their annual fairs are on the twenty-fifth of June, the twenty-&s;econd of July, and eleventh of Novem|ber.

The town, within the&s;e fifty years, has been very con&s;iderably enlarged with a number of &s;pa|cious &s;treets built of noble brick hou&s;es. Here are three large churches and &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es for di&s;&s;enters; an elegant town-hou&s;e and ex|change under it; a noble wet dock or ba&s;on with iron flood-gates, made at a great expence, and ca|pable of containing eighty or an hundred &s;ail of &s;hips: adjoining to it is a large commodious cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e; and the entrance to the dock is &s;e|cured by two &s;tone piers carried out into the open harbour. Liverpool is a city of merchants and manufacturers, who trade to all parts of the world except the Ea&s;t-Indies, particularly to America and the coa&s;t of Guinea. It has likewi&s;e a con&s;i|derable inland trade by means of the river Mer&s;ee, which is navigable almo&s;t up to Warrington. The Liverpool traders deal in all kinds of com|modities, and their commerce already rivals if not exceeds that of Bri&s;tol; of con&s;equence the town mu&s;t be extremely populous. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the harbour, there is an old ca&s;tle built by king John, and on the we&s;t a tower by the river Mer|&s;ee: there are al&s;o &s;ome occa&s;ional batteries erected for the defence of the &s;hipping; but the town is altogether open and unfortified. Here are &s;everal alms-hou&s;es for the widows of &s;ailors and others, a well regulated work-hou&s;e for employing the poor, and a noble charity &s;chool, where fifty boys and twelve girls are taught and maintained by vo|luntary contributions. Liverpool lies in a central &s;ituation, between the coa&s;t of Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and the i&s;le of Man, be&s;ides its &s;tand|ing remarkably commodious for an inland trade with Che&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire, and other parts in the north of England. Be&s;ides the Mer&s;ee there is the South channel or river Weaver, which is navigable, and chiefly u&s;ed for the inland con|veyance

of Che&s;hire chee&s;e, and rock &s;alt, a mi|neral which is dug in this county as well as in Che&s;hire, and &s;ent all over England. This being di&s;&s;olved in &s;ea-water and boiled up, produces a very &s;trong &s;alt, which may be u&s;ed in curing her|rings.</P>
<P>Warrington &s;ituated on the Mer&s;ee, over which there is here a noble &s;tone bridge, is an old town, large, rich, and populous, with a con&s;iderable market every Wedne&s;day, in con&s;equence of a grant from king Edward I. It gives the title of earl to the family of Booth; and has two annual fairs. The river abounds with lampreys, eels, &s;oles, lob&s;ters, oy&s;ters, &s;hrimps, prawns, cockles, and mu&s;cles in &s;uch plenty, that they are u&s;ed in manuring the ground. It likewi&s;e affords mullets, greenbacks, and &s;turgeon. The town is famous for its malt and beer; and has a particular market every week for linnen and huckaback, which is made in great quantity in this neighbourhood. Here is a charity &s;chool for twenty-four boys, who are taught and cloathed out of an e&s;tate given for this purpo&s;e, by Peter Leigh, of Lyme, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
<P>Warrington, lying on the high road to Carli&s;le and Scotland, has been always deemed an impor|tant po&s;t, and &s;ecured accordingly by the king's troops, during rebellions and incur&s;ions in the North.</P>
<P>Manche&s;ter, though no more than a village, go|verned by a con&s;table or head borough, is neverthe|le&s;s one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing places in Eng|land, large, opulent, well built, and &s;o populous, that the number of its inhabitants are &s;aid to ex|ceed fifty thou&s;and.

It has a market every Sa|turday, and three annual fairs, on Whit-Monday,

on September 20, and November 6. It be&s;tows the title of duke on a branch of the hou&s;e of Montague. It &s;tands upon a hill, has noble quar|ries in the neighbourhood, where is likewi&s;e Ker|&s;al-moor, noted for hor&s;e-races.</P>
<P>Manche&s;ter is adorned with hand&s;ome &s;treets, a venerable old collegiate church &s;upported by three rows of pillars, remarkable for its choir, carved work, and curious clock; an hand&s;ome new church built by &s;ub&s;cription; and a &s;tone bridge over the Irwell, the arches of which are extreme|ly high on account of the nature of the river, which, de&s;cending from the mountainous part of the country, &s;ometimes ri&s;es four or five yards in one night. It has likewi&s;e a &s;pacious market-place, and an elegant exchange. The three mo&s;t re|markable foundations at Manche&s;ter, are the col|lege, ho&s;pital, and public &s;chool. The college was founded in the year 1422, by the lord Dela|ware: it was di&s;&s;olved by Edward VI. partly re|&s;tored by Mary, and founded anew by queen Elizabeth; it con&s;i&s;ts of one warden, four fel|lows, two chaplains, four &s;inging men, and four choiri&s;ters. Having &s;uffered in its revenues by the mal practices of its warden, it was finally re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by Charles I. and by an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the late reign, the king is impowered to be vi&s;itor of this collegiate church, as often as the warden or it happens to be bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital was founded by Humphry Chul|ham, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and incorporated by king Charles II. for the maintenance of forty poor boys; but it is now greatly enlarged, and provided with a good library. The public &s;chool was founded in the year 1$10, by Dr. Oldham, bi&s;hop of Exeter; but the foundation has been con&s;iderably enlarged by the oeconomy of the feoffees of the &s;chool: the &s;alaries of the ma&s;ters have been augmented,

<P>Manche&s;ter, however, owes all its wealth to the manufactures of fu&s;tian, linnen, checques, tick|ing, and inkle, which the inhabitants have car|ried on above a century, with remarkable &s;pirit, ingenuity, and &s;ucce&s;s.

At a country village called Overburrow, there is a tradition that here &s;tood, between the Lac and the Lon, a great city which was be&s;ieged, reduced by famine, and de&s;troyed; but no-body knows by whom, or at what period. The tradition, however, &s;eems to be confirmed by the finding of many Latin in&s;criptions, te&s;&s;e|lated pavements, and Roman coins in this neigh|bourhood.

<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, SOIL, PRODUCT.</HEAD>
<P>The face of this country is agreeably varied by hill and dale, wood and water; and except in the we&s;tern part, where there is a great number of naked hills, it generally exhibits the appearance of extraordinary cultivation and fertility. Viewed from the top of Gate&s;head Fell, it looks like one va&s;t, beautiful garden, inter&s;per&s;ed with groves, lawns, meadows, and corn-fields. The &s;oil in the hilly parts mu&s;t of cour&s;e be barren; but the plains are remarkably fruitful. It produces corn and cattle in great abundance and perfection. The mountains yield iron, vitriol, and a con&s;iderable quantity of lead; and almo&s;t every part of the bi&s;hopric affords plenty of coal, which employs a great number of hands and ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;titutes a nur&s;ery of excellent &s;eamen.</P>

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Durham is a county palatine, governed by the bi&s;hop, who had formerly great prerogatives. He
<PB N="316" REF="3270">
had power to create barons, appoint judges, con|voke parliaments, rai&s;e taxes, and coin money. The courts of ju&s;tice were kept in his name; and he granted pardons for tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, alienations, rapes, murders, and felonies of every denomina|tion. He erected corporations, granted markets and fairs, created officers by patent, was lord ad|miral of the &s;eas and waters within the county palatine: great part of the lands were held of the &s;ee <HI>in capite.</HI> In a word, he exerci&s;ed all the power and juri&s;diction of a &s;overeign prince. How, and at what period the&s;e prerogatives were obtained, it is not ea&s;y to determine. Malme&s;bury &s;ays the lands were granted by king Alfred, who likewi&s;e made the church a &s;anctuary for criminals; but his authority is not infallible. This &s;ee was an|tiently called the patrimony of St. Cuthbert, who had been bi&s;hop of Landisfarne or Holy I&s;land, near Berwick. His bones being transferred to Durham, were long e&s;teemed as precious relicks; and the people of the county con&s;idered them|&s;elves as Halwerk men, exempted from all other but holy work, that is, the defence of St. Cuth|bert's body. Certain it is, they pretended to hold their lands by this tenure, and refu&s;ed to &s;erve out of the county, either for the king or bi&s;hop. Be that as it may, king Edward I. broke through the&s;e privileges, and curtailed the prerogatives of the bi&s;hops, which were &s;till further abridged by Henry VIII. Neverthele&s;s, the bi&s;hop is &s;till earl of Sadberg, a place in this county, which he holds by barony. He is &s;heriff paramount, and appoints his own deputy, who makes up his audit to him, in&s;tead of accounting to the exchequer. He has all the forfeitures upon outlawries; and he and his temporal chancellor act as ju&s;tices of the peace for the county palatine, which compre|hends Creke, in York&s;hire, Bedlington, Northam,
<PB N="317" REF="3280">
and Holy I&s;land, in Northumberland, the inha|bitants of the&s;e places having benefit of the courts at Durham. The judges of a&s;&s;ize and all the of|ficers of the court, have &s;till their ancient &s;alaries from the bi&s;hop; and he con&s;titutes the &s;tanding officers by his letters patent. He has the power of pre&s;iding in per&s;on in any of the courts of judica|ture. Even when judgment of blood is given, this prelate may &s;it in court in his purple robes, tho' the canons forbid any clergyman to be pre&s;ent in &s;uch ca&s;es: hence the old &s;aying, <HI>&s;olum, Dunelmen&s;e &s;tola jus dicet et en&s;e.</HI> It was not till the reign of Charles II. that the Bi&s;hopric &s;ent repre&s;entatives to parliament. At pre&s;ent it &s;ends only four; two knights for the &s;hire, and two burge&s;&s;es for the city of Durham.</P>
<P>Durham, the capital, &s;ituated upon a hill al|mo&s;t &s;urrounded by the river Were, is con&s;idera|ble for its extent and the number of its inhabi|tants, as well as for being the &s;ee and &s;eat of the bi&s;hop, who is lord paramount. It &s;tands about two hundred and eighty miles north from London, being remarkable for the &s;alubrity of its air, and the abundance and cheapne&s;s of its provi&s;ions. The&s;e circum&s;tances have induced a great deal of good company to take up their re&s;idence at Dur|ham, which is &s;till further animated by the pre|&s;ence and court of the bi&s;hop and his clergy. The town is &s;aid to have been built about &s;eventy years before the Norman conque&s;t, on occa&s;ion of bring|ing hither the body of St. Cuthbert. It was fir&s;t incorporated by Richard I. but queen Elizabeth extended its privileges. At length, in the year 1684, it obtained a charter, in con&s;equence of which, it is now governed by a mayor, twelve al|dermen, twelve common-council men, with a re|corder, and inferior officers. The&s;e can hold a court-leet and court-baron within the city, but under the &s;tyle of the bi&s;hop, who as count pala|tine
<PB N="318" REF="3290">
appoints a judge, &s;teward, &s;heriffs, and other inferior magi&s;trates. The mayor and aldermen al&s;o keep a <HI>pie pouldres</HI> court at their fairs, and pay a yearly toll to the bi&s;hop. They have a weekly market on Saturday, and three annual fairs. Dur|ham is about a mile in length and as much in breadth, re&s;embling the figure of a crab, the mar|ket-place exhibiting the body, and the claws be|ing repre&s;ented by the &s;treets, which bend accord|ing to the cour&s;e of the river that almo&s;t &s;urrounds one part of the city. They are, moreover, dark and narrow, and &s;ome of them lying on the accli|vity of a &s;teep hill, are very difficult and dange|rous to wheel carriages. There are two con&s;idera|ble &s;uburbs; one by Elvet bridge, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;mall &s;treets; and another called Framgate, leading to Newca&s;tle. The hou&s;es are in general &s;trong built, but neither light nor elegant. The mo&s;t remarkable edifices are the cathedral with &s;ix other churches, three &s;tanding in the city, and as many in the &s;uburbs; the college; the ca&s;tle, or bi&s;hop's palace; the toll-booth near St. Nicholas's church; the cro&s;s and conduit in the market|place; with two bridges over the Elvet. The cathedral was begun by bi&s;hop Carilepho in the eleventh century. It is a large, magnificent, Go|thic &s;tructure, four hundred and eleven feet long, and four&s;core in breadth, having a cro&s;s i&s;le in the middle one hundred and &s;eventy feet in length, and two &s;maller ailes at each end. On the &s;outh &s;ide is a fine cloy&s;ter; on the ea&s;t, the old library, the chapter-hou&s;e, and part of the deanery; on the we&s;t, the dormitory, under which is the trea|&s;ury and a chantry; and on the we&s;t &s;ide is the new library, an elegant building begun by dean Sudbury about &s;eventy years ago, on the &s;pot where &s;tood the old refectory of the convent. The middle tower of the cathedral is two hundred and twelve feet high. The whole building is
<PB N="319" REF="3300">
arched and &s;upported by huge pillars. Several of the windows are curiou&s;ly painted; and there is a hand&s;ome &s;creen at the entrance into the choir. Sixteen bi&s;hops are interred in the chapter-hou&s;e, which is &s;eventy-five feet long, and thirty-three broad, arched over-head, with a magnificent &s;eat at the upper end for the in&s;talment of the bi&s;hops. The con&s;i&s;tory is kept in the chapel or we&s;t aile called Galilee, which was built by bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, and had formerly &s;ixteen altars for women, as they were not allowed to advance farther than the line of marble by the &s;ide of the font; here like|wi&s;e are depo&s;ited the bones of the venerable Bede, who&s;e elogium is written on an old parch|ment &s;croll that hangs over his tomb. The long cro&s;s aile, at the extremity of the church, was for|merly di&s;tingui&s;hed by nine altars, four to the north, and four to the &s;outh, and the mo&s;t magni|ficent in the middle dedicated to the patron St. Cuthbert, who&s;e rich &s;hrine was in this quarter, formerly much frequented by pilgrims. The church is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome old records relating to the affairs of Scotland, the kings of which were great benefactors to this cathedral. The orna|ments here u&s;ed for admini&s;tering the divine offi|ces, are &s;aid to be richer than tho&s;e of any other cathedral in England. Before the reformation, it was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>eccle&s;ia &s;anctae Mariae et &s;ancti Cuthberti;</HI> but it obtained the ap|pellation of <HI>eccle&s;ia cathedralis chri&s;ti et beatae Mariae,</HI> in the reign of Henry VIII. who endowed the deanery with twelve prebendaries, twelve minor canons, a deacon, &s;ub-deacon, &s;ixteen lay &s;ing|ing men, a &s;chool-ma&s;ter and u&s;her, a ma&s;ter of the choir, a divinity reader, eight alms-men, eighteen &s;cholars, ten choiri&s;ters, two vergers, two porters, two cooks, two butlers, and two &s;acri&s;tans. On the &s;outh-&s;ide of the cathedral, is the college, a &s;pacious court formed by the hou&s;es of the pre|bendaries,
<PB N="320" REF="3310">
who are richly endowed and extremely well lodged. Above the college-gate, at the ea&s;t-end, is the exchequer; and at the we&s;t, a large hall for entertaining &s;trangers, with the granary and other offices of the convent. The college-&s;chool, with the ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, &s;tands on the north &s;ide of the cathedral. Between the church-yard and ca&s;tle, is an open area called the Palace-green, at the we&s;t-end of which &s;tands the &s;hire-hall, where the a&s;&s;izes and &s;e&s;&s;ions are held for the county. Hard by is the library built by bi&s;hop Co&s;in, to|gether with the exchequer rai&s;ed by bi&s;hop Nevil, in which are kept the offices bolonging to the county-palatine-court. There is an ho&s;pital on the ea&s;t, endowed by bi&s;hop Co&s;in, and at each end of it are two &s;chools founded by bi&s;hop Langley. On the north, is the ca&s;tle built by William the Conqueror, and afterwards converted into the bi&s;hop's palace, the outward gate of which is, at pre&s;ent, the county-gaol.</P>
<P>The city con&s;i&s;ts of three manors; the bi&s;hop's manor containing the city liberties and the bailey, held of him by the &s;ervice of ca&s;tle-guard; the manor of the dean and chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of the Elvet's cro&s;s gate, South-gate &s;treet; and the manor of Gilligate, formerly belonging to the di&s;|&s;olved ho&s;pital of Kepyar in this neighbourhood, but granted by Edward VI. to John Cockburn, lord of Orm&s;toun, and late in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of John Tempe&s;t, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>. The bi&s;hopric of Durham is one of the be&s;t in England, not only on account of its ample revenues and prerogatives, but be|cau&s;e living is remarkably cheap in this county, and the bi&s;hop has a great number of rich bene|fices in his gift.</P>

<P>Marwood is a &s;mall town on the &s;ame river, with a weekly market, and a good &s;hare of the &s;tocking manufacture.</P>
<P>Darlington is an agreeable town, well peopled, &s;ituated on the &s;mall river Skern, over which there is a &s;tone-bridge. It has a weekly market, and an annual fair; carries on a very con&s;iderable manu|facture of huckaback, and linnen; and is a great thoroughfare between London and Newca&s;tle. It has a hand&s;ome church, and a &s;pacious market place; but as the &s;treets are not paved, they are very dirty in the winter. At Oxenhall, a hamlet in this neighbourhood, are three pits, called Hell|kettles, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of an earth|quake, to be very deep, and to communicate with the river Tees, which receives the Skern not far from this place: but, in all probability, they are no other than coal-pits filled with &s;ubterraneous wa|ter. The Skern is famous for its pikes, as well as for the quality of its water, which is counted excellent for bleaching linnen.</P>
<P>Sadberg is a village between Darlington and Stockton, remarkable for nothing but giving the
<PB N="322" REF="3330">
title of earl to the bi&s;hop of Durham. When, or how, or wherefore, this title was conferred, it is not ea&s;y to explain.</P>
<P>Stockton is a corporation town governed by a mayor and aldermen. It &s;tands upon the Tees, about two leagues from the mouth of that river, which abounds with &s;almon, and is navigable to this place. The town is well built and agreeable, with a good weekly market, and an annual fair that la&s;ts four days. Provi&s;ions are in &s;uch plenty, and living &s;o cheap in Stockton, that many fa|milies of &s;mall fortunes have here fixed their ha|bitation. The place is famous for its ale, and be|gins to be both populous and rich; for the inha|bitants drive a con&s;iderable trade with London for lead, butter, and bacon. It holds of the bi&s;hop as lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Hartlepool is a &s;mall town, but a very ancient corporation, governed by a mayor and his bre|thren. It &s;tands on a promontory almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded by the &s;ea, about &s;ix miles above the mouth of the Tees, having a very commodious and &s;afe harbour, to which the colliers, in their voyages between London and Newca&s;tle, have often recour&s;e in tempe&s;tuous weather. Hartle|pool has a weekly market, which was formerly con&s;iderable, but it is now much dimini&s;hed; and the inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by fi&s;hing, and the money &s;pent by the ve&s;&s;els that u&s;e the harbour.</P>
<P>Sunderland is a populous borough and &s;ea-port, &s;ituated on the &s;outh bank of the river Were, and almo&s;t &s;urrounded at high water. The town is well built, and adorned by an elegant church. But the harbour being barred up, admits not ve&s;&s;els of any burthen. Neverthele&s;s, a great quantity of coal is here &s;hipped for London. The &s;hips, however, are obliged to be in the open road, which is very dangerous riding: but this
<PB N="323" REF="3340">
danger contributes towards forming a very hardy and expert race of &s;eamen, for which the place is famous. It gives the title of earl to the family of Spencer, who are likewi&s;e dukes of Marl|borough.</P>
<P>South-Shields is a village &s;ituated on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river Tyne, at its mouth, oppo&s;ite to North-Shields, which we have mentioned in our de&s;cription of Northumberland. Here a good number of &s;hip-ma&s;ters, &s;eamen, and others, belonging to the coal trade, re&s;ide with their fa|milies. The place is al&s;o noted for its &s;alt works, con&s;i&s;ting of above two hundred pans for boiling the &s;ea water, which are &s;aid to con&s;ume annually one hundred thou&s;and chaldron of coals; a branch of manufacture which mu&s;t employ a great num|ber of hands. There are &s;everal gla&s;s-hou&s;es in this neighbourhood, the workmen of which are &s;aid to be of foreign extraction, and to &s;peak a language peculiar to them&s;elves. According to tradition, their ance&s;tors were Normans, removed hither from Sturbridge, in the reign of Edward VI. This is a fact that might be ea&s;ily a&s;certained by any one, who compares their language with that which was formerly &s;poken in Normandy.</P>
<P>Jarrow, formerly Gervey, the birth-place of the venerable Bede, is a very incon&s;iderable vil|lage on the &s;ame river, a little above South-Shields. Here was a Benedictine mona&s;tery found|ed in the reign of Egfrid, as appears by an in|&s;cription on the wall. Bede was a monk of this convent, and here died in the year 734; but his body was afterwards removed to Durham. In con&s;equence of his great reputation, the mona&s;|tery flouri&s;hed, being very rich and exten&s;ive, when it was de&s;troyed by the Danes. In the &s;e|quel the monks were transferred to Durham; and this was al&s;o the fate of tho&s;e belonging to
<PB N="324" REF="3350">
the friery of Monk&s;weremouth, &s;ituated near Sun|derland, from whence the monks were tran&s;lated in the year 10$3, in order to attend the body of St. Cuthbert, when bi&s;hop Carilepho removed it from Lindisfarne to Durham.</P>
<P>Gate-&s;ide, or rather Goat's-head, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Gabro&s;entum of the Romans, is no other than a &s;uburb to Newca&s;tle, with which it is con|nected by the bridge over the Tyne. It con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;treet, built on the declivity of a hill, which is &s;o &s;teep as to be very trouble&s;ome to wheel-carriages. Here was formerly a mona&s;tery dedicated to St. Edmund.</P>
<P>Auckland Bi&s;hops, commonly called Bi&s;hop's Auckland, is a market-town agreeably &s;ituated on an eminence, near the conflux of the Were, with the rivulet Gaunle&s;s. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from a fore&s;t of oaks belonging to a palace, or ca&s;tle, which the bi&s;hop has in this di&s;trict. The air of this town is counted very &s;alutary. The hou&s;es are generally well built. The church, which was formerly collegiate, is a venerable building; and there is a ma&s;&s;y &s;tone bridge over the Were, which was built at the expence of bi&s;hop Skerlaw. The ca&s;tle was built, or im|proved, in the reign of Edward I. by bi&s;hop Beck, who enlarged and beautified the great hall, and added a chapel for a dean and &s;ix prebendaries, who were lodged in the quadrangle, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the ca&s;tle. The gate of the college, and other adjoining buildings, were added by bi&s;hop Booth, in the reign of Henry VI. &s;o that it be|came a magnificent palace. But in the civil war it was demoli&s;hed by Sir Arthur Ha&s;lerig, one of the parliament's generals, who built a new hou&s;e with the materials. This, however, was pulled down in its turn by bi&s;hop Co&s;ins, who added a large apartment to what remained of the old
<PB N="325" REF="3360">
palace, and erected a new chapel, in which he lies interred.</P>
<P>Stanhope, in Were&s;dale, is a &s;mall market|town, with a large park, famous for being the &s;pot where the Scotti&s;h army encamped in the reign of Edward III. who&s;e quarters were beat up in the night by lord Douglas, who penetrated even to the royal tent, and had well nigh made the king his pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Sedgefield is a very &s;mall market-town, &s;ituated near the river Skerne, between Durham and Stock|ton. It has an annual fair, and an alms-hou&s;e; but is a place of little con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>ROMAN ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Fragments of a Roman highway are &s;een in different parts of this county; particularly in the neighbourhood of Bernard's ca&s;tle, Stainton, Strith|lam, Che&s;ter-le-&s;treet, and Benche&s;ter. Several Roman coins have been found at Che&s;ter-le-&s;treet. An altar, with an in&s;cription, was dug up at Percebridge; and adjoining to the bridge is the area of an old Roman fortification. Hard by &s;e|veral coins and urns have been di&s;covered, toge|ther with a &s;tone coffin, containing a human &s;ke|leton. At Binche&s;ter, a &s;mall village of two or three hou&s;es &s;ituated on the top of a hill, are the remains of the ancient city Binovium, or Vino|vium, con&s;i&s;ting of ruined walls, and heaps of rubbi&s;h, among which &s;everal urns and altars, with in&s;criptions, have been found, and many coins, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Binche&s;ter pennies. Near the river Were, oppo|&s;ite to the &s;mall town of Lumley, &s;tands Che&s;ter-le-&s;treet, an incon&s;iderable town, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Conderium of Antoninus: the bi&s;hops of Lindi&s;|farne fled hither from the cruelty of the Danes,
<PB N="326" REF="3370">
with the body of St. Cuthbert, and here they re|mained one hundred and thirteen years, until it was tran&s;lated to Durham. Many Roman coins have been found at this place, as well as at the village of Lanche&s;ter, thought by &s;ome to be the old Longovicum, where a great number of altars and &s;epulchre-&s;tones, with in&s;criptions, have been di&s;covered. The &s;ame kind of antiquities, &s;uch as medals, altars, and &s;tones, have been dug up at Whitburn, near Sunderland; and at the &s;mall village of Ebche&s;ter, upon the Derwent, where are the ruins of a Roman &s;tation, with large &s;uburbs. Finally, on the &s;outh bank of the river Tyne, there was found a curious altar, de&s;cribed by doctor Li&s;ter, with an imperfect in&s;cription, by which, however, it appears to have been de|dicated to Antoninus Caracalla.</P>
<P>Gate&s;head is &s;uppo&s;ed by Cambden to be the Gabro&s;entum of the ancients, a frontier garri&s;on defended by the &s;econd cohort of the Thracians, in the times of the later emperors. It was here that Walther, bi&s;hop of Durham and governor of Northumberland under William the Conque|ror, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the populace, whom his tyranny had driven to de&s;pair.</P>

<HEAD>YORKSHIRE, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>This county, the large&s;t in England, is bound|ed on the &s;outh by Derby&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, and Lincoln&s;hire; on the north by Durham and We&s;tmoreland; on the ea&s;t by the German ocean; and on the we&s;t by Lanca&s;hire, and a part of Che&s;hire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It is upwards of eighty miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, near as much in breadth, and about three hundred and &s;ixty in circumference, con|taining, in the whole, twenty-&s;ix hundreds or wapentakes, forty-nine market-towns, five hun|dred and &s;ixty-three pari&s;hes, two hundred and forty-two vicarages, with many chapels of ea&s;e, and two thou&s;and three hundred and thirty villages. Its area is computed by &s;ome at four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty-four &s;quare miles, by others at three millions &s;even hundred and &s;eventy thou|&s;and acres, and its inhabitants at five hundred and thirty thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>It is divided into three parts, or ridings, viz. the We&s;t, Ea&s;t, and North; &s;o denominated from their &s;ituation, in re&s;pect of the city of York. Each of the&s;e is as large, if not larger, than any ordinary county. There are other divi&s;ions, as Richmond&s;hire, Allerton&s;hire, Howden&s;hire, Hal|lan&s;hire, Craven, Cleveland, Mar&s;hland, Holder|ne&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>As the &s;oil and face of the country vary greatly, &s;o does the air. In the hilly parts the air is good,
<PB N="328" REF="3390">
but the &s;oil very indifferent; of the lower, &s;ome are mar&s;hy, others drier, and the &s;oil of both rich; but the air of the former is more foggy and unhealthy than that of the latter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>The manufactures of this county are cutlery and hard-wares; particularly knives, bits, and &s;purs; but the principal are &s;tockings and woollen cloth, with which it &s;upplies in a great mea&s;ure Germany, and the North. As to the produce, it abounds in corn, cattle, hor&s;es, lead and iron, coal, wood, lime, liquorice, alum, jet, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It lies wholly in the northern circuit, and much the greater part of it in the dioce&s;e of York, that only, which is called Richmond&s;hire, belonging to the dioce&s;e of Che&s;ter. The members it &s;ends to parliament are thirty, of which two are for the &s;hire, and twenty-eight for the towns.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the WEST-RIDING.</HEAD>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular de&s;cription of the &s;everal ridings, beginning with the We&s;t.</P>
<P>This, which is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t populous and fruitful of the three, is bounded on the ea&s;t by the ea&s;t-riding, from which it is &s;eparated by the Ou&s;e; on the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t by part of Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire; on the &s;outh and &s;outh|ea&s;t by Lincoln&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, and Der|by&s;hire; and on the north by the north-riding. It is well watered with brooks and rivers, the chief of which are the Ou&s;e, the Don, the Cal|der, the Are, the Ribble, and the Wherfe. All the&s;e abound with fi&s;h. The Ou&s;e is the large&s;t; for it receives all the re&s;t, except the Ribble, and is navigable from York to the Humber. There
<PB REF="3400">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of the City of York</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="329" REF="3410">
are &s;everal hills in this riding, &s;ome of which are very high, as the Pendle, Pennegent, and Ingleborough. For fuel there is pit coal, wood, and turf; but the la&s;t is dug only in the boggy part of Mar&s;hland, and u&s;ed chiefly in the neigh|bouring villages. The air, in general, is good, e&s;pecially in the dry, hilly parts; but the &s;oil there is inferior to that of the lower parts, e&s;pe|cially about the river Ou&s;e, and the Mar&s;hland, where it is very rich, yielding wheat, barley, oats, and luxuriant pa&s;turage. This riding abounds in firs, yews, and che&s;nuts; in quarries of lime, and other &s;tone; in iron, jet, and liquorice; in black cattle, fine hor&s;es, &s;heep, and goats. A &s;tone of a blui&s;h colour is dug in it, which, after being calcined, is converted into alum, by various per|colations and boilings.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now give an account of the chief towns in this riding, beginning with the parlia|mentary, after we have de&s;cribed the city of York, though it does not belong to this more than to the other ridings, being a county of it&s;elf.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the CITY of YORK.</HEAD>
<P>This city, in Latin <HI>Eboracum,</HI> is &s;o ancient, that the origin of it is uncertain. In the time of the Romans a legion was &s;tationed here, it being then the capital of the Brigantes, and here died the emperor Severus, and Flavius Valerius Con|&s;tantius Chlorus, father of Con&s;tantine the Great. There was then al&s;o a temple of Bellona here, and no le&s;s than three military ways went from hence. In the time of the Saxons it was erected into an archbi&s;hopric by pope Honorius, to which are now &s;ubject, the bi&s;hoprics of Che&s;ter, Durham, Car|li&s;le, and the I&s;le of Man; though anciently twelve bi&s;hoprics in England, and all Scotland,
<PB N="330" REF="3420">
were. A horn is &s;till kept in the min&s;ter, by which Ulphius, one of the Saxon princes, be&s;towed all his lands and revenues upon the church.</P>
<P>This city &s;uffered very much during the ravages of the Danes; but, after the conque&s;t, it began to flouri&s;h again. The cathedral, which co&s;t a long time and a great deal of money in building, is a mo&s;t &s;tately Gothic pile. Its chapter-hou&s;e is particularly admired for its painted gla&s;s, its fine marble &s;talls, its pillars of alaba&s;ter, and curious contrivance. In it is the following line in gold letters:</P>
<Q>Ut Ro&s;a, flos florum, &s;ic e&s;t Domus i&s;ta Domorum.</Q>
<P>The choir is remarkable for its fine carvings, par|ticularly the &s;tatues of all the Engli&s;h monarchs; and the windows are exqui&s;itely painted with the hi&s;tory of the Bible. The lanthorn &s;teeple is &s;eventy foot &s;quare, and one hundred and eighty-eight high, and the windows are forty-five. At the &s;outh end is a circular light, called the marigold window from the colour of its gla&s;s; and at the north end is a very large one, who&s;e painting repre&s;ents em|broidery. Here, in the reign of Richard I. was a barbarous ma&s;&s;acre of the Jews; and Henry III. had, in this place, an interview with Alexander, king of Scots. Several parliaments were held here in the reigns of Edward I. and II. A tribunal, not unlike the parliaments of France, was e&s;tabli&s;hed at York, by Henry VIII. to de|cide all cau&s;es in the&s;e northern parts, according to the rules of equity.</P>
<P>This city, as hath been already ob&s;erved, is a county of it&s;elf; and its juri&s;diction extends over thirty-&s;ix villages and hamlets in the neighbour|hood. It is generally reckoned the &s;econd city in
<PB N="331" REF="3430">
England; but though it &s;tands upon more ground, it is inferior in trade, wealth, and number of people, to Bri&s;tol. It is &s;ituate in a fine plain, in the middle of the &s;hire, on both &s;ides the Ou&s;e, walled, and divided into four wards, containing twenty-eight pari&s;hes. It enjoys large privileges and immunities, conferred upon it by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings from Henry II and its chief magi&s;trate has the title of lord-mayor, which is an honour peculiar to it and London. Richard II. made it a county of it&s;elf. The con&s;ervancy of mo&s;t of the rivers of the county, within certain limits, be|longs to the lord-mayor and aldermen. The middle arch of the bridge here over the Ou&s;e, is thought to equal the Rialto at Venice, in archi|tecture, height, and breadth, the diameter being eighty-one foot, and the height fifty-one. Though this city is &s;ixty miles di&s;tant from the &s;ea, yet &s;hips of &s;eventy tons burthen come up the river to it. The town hou&s;e, or Guildhall, &s;tands upon the bridge, and is &s;uperior in all re&s;pects to that of London. In the popi&s;h times there were nine abbeys here, and a va&s;t number of churches; but of the latter there are only &s;eventeen now. The &s;teeple of that of Allhallows, is reckoned the fine&s;t in England. The archbi&s;hop has a fine pa|lace; and the a&s;&s;embly-room, de&s;igned by the earl of Burlington, is very noble. Here are plays, a&s;&s;emblies, concerts, and the like enter|tainments, at &s;ome hou&s;e or other, almo&s;t every night in the week. In the old ca&s;tle, built ori|ginally by William the Conqueror, and repaired in 1701, the a&s;&s;izes are kept. It &s;erves al&s;o for the county gaol, which is the neate&s;t and plea|&s;ante&s;t in England, with an area larger than that of the King's-bench, and has a hand&s;ome chapel in it, with a good allowance for a preacher. This
<PB N="332" REF="3440">
city has long given the title of duke to &s;ome branch of the royal family, and lately to his royal highne&s;s Edward, next brother to his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty George III. who was carried off by a violent fever at Monaco in Italy, in the flower of his age, to the great grief of the nation, and the royal family.</P>
<P>The plenty and cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions induces many per&s;ons of &s;mall fortune, or that would live frugally, to take up their abode here; and the venerable remains of Roman antiquities, and tho&s;e of a later date, as abbeys, churches, and ca&s;tles, procure this city a vi&s;it from every curious traveller. Many Roman altars, urns, coins, in|&s;criptions, &amp;c. have been found; and Saxon coins are &s;till extant, that have been &s;truck here. The members for this city have precedence of all others, except tho&s;e of London, in the hou&s;e of commons. An infirmary, after the manner of tho&s;e of Bath, Bri&s;tol, &amp;c hath been erected in it; and a cotton manufacture e&s;tabli&s;hed, and brought to great perfection. Be&s;ides four weekly markets, it has a great many fairs; one, in particular, every other Thur&s;day, for cattle and &s;heep.</P>
<P>The parliamentary boroughs in this riding, are Knare&s;borough, Rippon, Boroughbridge, and Pon|tefract, of which in order.</P>
<P>Knare&s;borough. This town is almo&s;t encom|pa&s;&s;ed by the river Nid, and is &s;aid to take its name from a ca&s;tle which it had formerly upon a craggy rock. It is a pretty large town, and a borough by pre&s;cription, governed by a bailiff. It &s;tands hard by the fore&s;t, that takes its name from the town; in which are &s;everal medicinal &s;prings, very near one another, and yet of very different qualities. One is a chalybeate water, and
<PB N="333" REF="3450">
is called the Sweet-Spaw, or Vitrioline-Well; another has the name of the Stinking-Spaw, or Sul|phur-Well, of Harrigate; becau&s;e it is &s;trongly im|pregnated with that mineral, and has a foetid &s;mell; the third is &s;tiled St. Mungo's, from a Scotti&s;h &s;aint of that name, much honoured in the&s;e parts. The two la&s;t are generally u&s;ed for bathing in. From a &s;pungy porous rock in the town drops a water, called from thence the Dropping-Well, of &s;o petrifying a nature, that it has formed a &s;olid rock all the way, till it runs into the Nid. The neighbouring fields are noted for liquorice, and for a &s;oft yellow marle, that is a valuable ma|nure. So much were the baths here frequented before the Scarborough-&s;paw came in vogue, that, it is &s;aid, a cold-bath was rented at two hundred pounds a year. The manor of this town belongs to the duchy of Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>Rippon, a large, well-built, plea&s;ant town, by the river Ure, over which there are two &s;tately &s;tone-bridges. It is &s;aid to owe its ri&s;e to a mona&s;tery founded by Wilfrid, archbi&s;hop of York; but Bede tells us, that the Scots had one here before. This mona&s;tery, which was very famous, and had the privilege of &s;anctuary con|ferred upon it by king Athel&s;tan, became after|wards a college for a dean and &s;ecular canons; and at this day retains its collegiate privileges, having a dean and chapter: but though the former has no &s;eat in the convocation of the pro|vince of York, the latter &s;ends a proctor. This town had formerly a great woollen manufacture, which it hath now lo&s;t; but is &s;till a &s;taple for wool, for which there is a weekly market. In 1322, a &s;ynod was held here. On one &s;ide of the church is a college for &s;inging men, and on the other a mount, called Hil&s;haw, ca&s;t up, as it
<PB N="334" REF="3460">
is &s;aid, by the Danes. King James I. granted the town a charter, to be governed by a mayor, twelve alderman, and twenty-four a&s;&s;i&s;tants. Here are &s;everal great hor&s;e fairs, and the be&s;t &s;purs in England made with rowels which will &s;trike through a &s;hilling, and break &s;ooner than bend. At its fairs are al&s;o &s;old cattle of all kinds, and a great deal of tanned leather. In the popi&s;h times the church was famous for Wil|fred's needle, a pious fraud, by which the canons got money. There was a narrow pa&s;&s;age, that led to a vaulted room under ground. Through this pa&s;&s;age the holy men gave out no woman could pa&s;s, though ever &s;o &s;lender, if uncha&s;te; but, if otherwi&s;e, &s;he might with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, though ever &s;o big. Yet, it is likely, no woman ever pa&s;&s;ed it, cha&s;te or uncha&s;te, that could not pay; and that tho&s;e who did, always found the walls extremely polite and obliging. In 1695, a con&s;iderable number of Saxon coins were found here; and in the reign of Charles I. a treaty was concluded betwixt that king and the Scots, after the &s;econd rupture. The church, which is both parochial and colle|giate, is a very venerable Gothic pile, and the market-place is reckoned the fine&s;t in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Boroughbridge. This is a con&s;iderable town, It takes its name from a &s;tone bridge over the Ure, who&s;e arches are very lofty. The chief &s;upport of it is hardware, which it vends to a con&s;iderable amount. We are told, that a &s;oldier, in the wars betwixt Edward II. and the barons, killed Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, as he pa&s;&s;ed over the bridge, by thru&s;ting a &s;pear or pike into his body, through a hole, below the bridge.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="3470">
Pontefract, or Pomfret, a neat town, on the banks of the Are. It is &s;aid to take its name from a broken bridge, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been laid anciently over that mar&s;hy &s;pot called the Wa&s;h. Here are the ruins of a noble old ca&s;tle, where Richard II. was barbarou&s;ly murdered, and two of Edward V's uncles. The collegiate chapel of St. Clement, which had a dean, three prebendaries, &amp;c. is &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hable in it. This town has a good market, and fairs for hor&s;es, &s;heep, and other cattle. It is a corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder, aldermen, and burge&s;&s;es, and gives title of earl to the family of Fermor. In the reign of queen Elizabeth two hundred pounds were left by George Talbot, earl of Shrew&s;bury, to be lent for ever, at five pounds a time, on proper &s;ecurity, for three years, to the poor artificers of the town; and Thomas Wentworth, e&s;quire, an|ce&s;tor to the marquis of Rockingham, left two hundred pounds to the charity-&s;chool. A branch of the great Roman military way, called Ermin|&s;treet, which pa&s;&s;ed from Lincoln to York, may be traced betwixt this town and Donca&s;ter. The adjacent country yields plenty of lime&s;tone, toge|ther with liquorice, and &s;kirrets.</P>
<P>The other places of any note in this riding are:</P>
<P>Sheffield, which is a large thriving town on the borders of Derby&s;hire, and by the river Don, over which it it has a fine &s;tone-bridge. It has been long noted for cutlers and &s;miths wares, e&s;pecially files and knives; and the fir&s;t mills for grind&s;tones were &s;et up here. It is advantage|ou&s;ly &s;ituated for the hardware bu&s;ine&s;s, in the neighbourhood of the iron mines. The ma&s;ter cutlers, who are incorporated by the name of the cutlers of Hallam&s;hire, of which the town is the
<PB N="336" REF="3480">
capital, are &s;aid to be about &s;ix hundred, and to employ about forty thou&s;and per&s;ons in the iron manufactures. Here is a great market for corn and other commodities. Be&s;ides the pari&s;h church, there are three chapels, to &s;erve which there is a vicar, and three a&s;&s;i&s;tants, with liberal allowances. A grammar-&s;chool was founded here by king James I. A certain number of burge&s;&s;es manage the revenue of it, and nominate the ma&s;ter and u&s;her, as others do that allotted for the maintenance of the vicar's a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and no|minate them. Mr. Evelin mentions a tree felled in the park here &s;o large, that two men on hor&s;e|back could not &s;ee the crown of one another's hats over it, as it lay on the ground. Mary, queen of Scots, who had taken refuge in England, after the battle of Lang&s;ide, expecting pro|tection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was, in violation of all the laws of ho&s;pitality, of the re&s;pect due to a crown|ed head, of ju&s;tice and humanity, kept pri&s;oner here &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years; and, to clo&s;e the black &s;cene, at la&s;t beheaded. An earl of Shrew&s;|bury, of the name of Talbot, erected and en|dowed an ho&s;pital here; and another gave two hun|dred pounds for ever to the poor. In the neigh|bourhood are &s;ome mines of alum.</P>
<P>Rotheram. This town takes its name from the Rother, near the conflux of which with the Don it &s;tands. Rotheram, archbi&s;hop of York, who was a native of the town, and took his name from it, founded a college on the bridge, that is over the Don here.</P>
<P>Donca&s;ter, a large populous town, upon the Don or Dan, from which and a ca&s;tle now in ruins, it takes its name. The Britons called it Caerdaun, and the Romans Danum. It is a cor|poration, governed by a mayor, recorder, alder|men, and common-council; has a good market
<PB N="337" REF="3490">
for corn, cattle, &amp;c. &s;everal fairs, and good inns, being a great thoroughfare, upon the high road, from London to Scotland, and the North of England. Here are two &s;trong, lofty, &s;tone|bridges over the Don; and a manufacture of knit wai&s;tcoats, petticoats, gloves, and &s;tockings. The revenues of the town are con&s;iderable, and it has a hand&s;ome church and ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Wakefield is a large, well built, thriving town, &s;tanding in a fruitful &s;oil, and cheap country, where there is no want of good cheer and good company. Here, in 1459, Richard duke of York was &s;lain, in a battle betwixt him and Henry VI. in memory of which his &s;on Edward IV. after|wards founded a chapel, upon the &s;tone-bridge over the Calder. In the market-place is a very curious cro&s;s, with a dome, and a room in which they tran&s;act their public bu&s;ine&s;s. The woollen manufacture is very con&s;iderable in this town, and its neighbourhood, and there is a weekly market for it here on Friday. Great quantities of coals are &s;ent down the Calder, which was made navigable hither in 1698, and as far as Halifax in 1740, to the Ou&s;e, and the towns upon its banks, and tho&s;e of the Humber, particularly to York. Wakefield is &s;o populous, that it is &s;aid even to vie with York it&s;elf, in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Tickhill, or Tickhall, is &s;aid to take its name from a mount or hill near it, on which was formerly a ca&s;tle. It has a hand&s;ome church, and gives name to an exten&s;ive &s;eigniory, on which many manors are dependent.</P>
<P>Barne&s;ley, commonly called Black Barne&s;ley, probably from its forges; for it is noted for its manufacture of wire and hardware. It is a well-built town.</P>
<P>Beautre is a con&s;iderable town upon the Idle, on the borders of Nottingham&s;hire. It is well
<PB N="338" REF="3500">
furni&s;hed with inns, being a great thoroughfare, upon the high road to Scotland; and from hence are exported lead, mill&s;tones, grind&s;tones, iron|wares, &amp;c. to Stockwith, Burton, Hull, and many other places; and from thence beyond &s;ea.</P>
<P>Huthersfield &s;tands on the Calder, and is one of the five towns in this county, that is mo&s;t noted for the cloathing trade.</P>
<P>Snath, or Snaithe, a &s;mall town, which, how|ever, has a pretty good trade, the Aire, on which it &s;tands, being navigable to it by boats. It is one hundred and &s;eventy-five miles from London.</P>
<P>Halifax &s;tands upon the Calder, and is very eminent for the cloathing trade. The pari&s;h is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t populous, if not the mo&s;t exten&s;ive in England; for it is above thirty miles in circumference, and be&s;ides the mother-church at Halifax and &s;ixteen meeting-hou&s;es, has twelve chapels, two of which are parochial. What is a little &s;ingular, all the meeting-hou&s;es here, except the quakers, have bells and burying grounds. The woollens principally manufactured here, are ker&s;eys and &s;halloons. Of the former it is affirmed, that one dealer hath &s;ent by commi&s;&s;ion &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds worth in a year to Hol|land and Hamburgh; and of the latter, it is &s;aid, one hundred thou&s;and pieces are made in this pari&s;h yearly. The inhabitants here, and in the neighbouring towns, are &s;o entirely employed in the&s;e manufactures, that agriculture is but little minded. Mo&s;t of their provi&s;ions of all &s;orts are brought from the North and Ea&s;t-Ridings, and from Lanca&s;hire, Che&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, and Warwick&s;hire. The markets are very much crowded for the buying and &s;elling provi&s;ions and manufactures. The cloths, at the fir&s;t erecting of the woollen manufactures in the&s;e parts, hav|ing been frequently &s;tolen off the tenters in the

hight, a law was made, by which the magi&s;trates of Halifax were empowered to pa&s;s &s;entence on, and execute all offenders, if they were taken in the fact, or owned it; or if the &s;tolen cloth was found upon them, provided al&s;o the crime was committed and the criminal apprehended within the liberties of the fore&s;t of Hardwick. Tho&s;e found guilty were executed in the following manner: an axe was drawn by a pulley to the top of a wooden engine, and fa&s;tened by a pin, which being pulled out, the axe fell down in an in&s;tant, and did its work. If they had &s;tole an ox, hor&s;e, or any other bea&s;t, it was led with them to the &s;caffold, and there fa&s;tened by a cord to the pin, that held up the axe; and when the &s;ignal was given by the jurors, who were the fir&s;t burghers within the &s;everal towns of the fore&s;ts the bea&s;t was driven away, and the pin plucked out, upon which the axe fell and did its office. This &s;evere and &s;ummary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, as thought, gave occa&s;ion to a litany, which is &s;till much more frequent in the mouths of the beg|gars and vagrants of the&s;e parts, than is the com|mon prayer, viz.</P>
<Q>&startq;From Hell, Hull, and Halifax, good Lord deliver us:&endq;</Q>
<P>though neither the engine, nor manner of pro|ceeding again&s;t them, are now in u&s;e.</P>
<P>Leeds, which &s;tands on the north-&s;ide of the fiver Aire, over which it has a &s;tately &s;tone bridge, hath long been famous for the woollen manufac|ture, and is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing towns in the county. On a market-day one may &s;ee a long &s;treet full of &s;tandings, and the&s;e with cloth for &s;ale. Of this cloth large quantities are &s;hipped off, at Hull, for Holland, Hamburgh, and the North; whence they are di&s;per&s;ed through

the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, &amp;c. John Harri&s;on, e&s;quire, a native of this town, was a great benefactor to it, by building and endowing a church, ho&s;pital, and free-&s;chool. The corpo|ration con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four a&s;&s;i&s;tants. On the market-days, when the market-bell rings, which is at &s;even in the morning in winter, and &s;ix in &s;ummer, the clothiers bring out their cloth from the inns; and when the bell cea&s;es, the chapmen come into the market, match their patterns, and in an hour's time, per|haps, bargain for twenty-thou&s;and pounds worth. The bell rings again at half an hour pa&s;t eight, upon which the clothiers give place to the linnen|drapers, hardware-men, &s;hoemakers, fruiterers, &amp;c. There have been five hundred loads of apples be|longing to the la&s;t of the&s;e here upon a market-day. At the &s;ame time there is an equal plenty and variety of fi&s;h and butchers meat expo&s;ed to &s;ale. Great quantities al&s;o of white cloth are &s;old in a magnificent hall, where notice is given by a bell when the &s;ale begins. Not only woollen goods, but coals and other commodities, are conveyed from hence by the Aire to Wakefield, York, and Hull. In a hou&s;e here, call Red-hall, there is an apartment in which king Charles I. lodged, and which, on that account, &s;till bears the name of the King's-chamber. There was a ca&s;tle here anciently, and now there is a &s;tately town-hall and parochial church, called St. Peter's. On the roof of it the delivering of the law by Mo&s;es is finely painted in fre&s;co. Here are al&s;o two charity-&s;chools, a work-hou&s;e, &s;everal alms hou&s;es and meeting-hou&s;es, one of which, belonging to the Pre&s;byterians, is a very hand&s;ome building. This town gives the title of duke to the family of O&s;born, and has &s;everal me|dicinal &s;prings about it.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="3530">
Sherborn is a pretty large populous town. The bi&s;hops of York, who were lords of the town, had anciently a palace in this place; and here, in 1645, a battle was fought betwixt king Charles I. and the parliament. There is an ho&s;pital, or &s;chool, for poor orphans, the expence of which, and four poor &s;cholars at St. John's-college, Cam|bridge, amounts to two hundred and fifty pounds a year. The town &s;tands near the conflux of the Wherfe, and Ou&s;e, where it has a harbour. It is noted for cherries, for the remains of a Roman highway, and for a &s;ort of &s;tone, which is very &s;ort in the quarry, but grows hard when expo&s;ed to the wind and weather.</P>
<P>Bradforth, or Bradford. This town is of note for its woollen manufacture, and for giving birth to doctor John Sharp, archbi&s;hop of York in the reign of William III.</P>
<P>Selby, though a &s;mall town, has a good trade, the river Ou&s;e, on which it &s;tands, being navigable to it by large ve&s;&s;els. Here is &s;aid to have been a mitted abbey, built by William the Conqueror, who&s;e &s;on Henry I. was born in the place.</P>
<P>At Aberforth, or Aberford, is &s;till to be &s;een the foundation of an old ca&s;tle, called by the inhabitants Ca&s;tle-Cary, and part of a Ro|man highway, as entire as when fir&s;t made, though that was about &s;ixteen hundred years ago. Here is al&s;o a manufacture of pins.</P>
<P>Tadca&s;ter. Here was formerly a ca&s;tle, out of the ruins of which a hand&s;ome bridge was built over the Wherfe, near which the town &s;tands. Many coins of Roman emperors al&s;o have been found in the neighbourhood. Excellent lime&s;tones are dug up near the town, and conveyed to York, and all the country round, for building, and other

purpo&s;es. Here is a free-&s;chool founded by Dr. Ogle|thorpe, bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and endowed with forty pounds a year; and al&s;o an almshou&s;e for twelve poor people, who have each a &s;hilling a week.</P>
<P>Skipton. This towns &s;tand near the Aire, in the middle of that part of the county called Craven. It is a pretty, well-built, healthy town, and had anciently a beautiful &s;trong ca&s;tle. In the church is the monument of George Clifford, earl of Cumberland, who made nine voyages, mo&s;t of them to the We&s;t-Indies, in the reign of queen Elizabeth. Here is a plentiful market, a hand&s;ome church, a grammar-&s;chool, and a P&s;alm|ody &s;chool, in which the town-boys are taught both to read and &s;ing p&s;alms by the pari&s;h clerk, who has a &s;alary for it.</P>

Aldborough, near Boroughbridge, is held to be the ancient <HI>I&s;urium.</HI> Many Roman an|tiquities have been found here. The remains of two Roman fortifications are yet to be &s;een, the one at Temple borough, near the Don and Rothe|ram; and the other between Rotheram and Sheffield. On the north-&s;ide of the &s;ame river is a large bank, continued for &s;everal miles, which in different places is called Wine's-bank, Dane's-bank, Devil's-bank, Kemp-bank, and Temple-bank. At Conne&s;borow, near the Don, on the declivity of a hill, are to be &s;een the remains of a very ancient ca&s;tle, to which Hengi&s;t retired to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t the Britons; and in the church-yard is a &s;tone of blue marble, with &s;e|veral antique figures on it. In the year 1697, be|tween Wakefield-Outwood, and Thorp on the hill, were found certain moulds, invented for counterfeiting the Roman coins. At Cookridge, between Ilkeley and Adle, Roman coins have been found; and in 1702, the foot&s;teps of a Ro|man town were di&s;covered on the moor, not far from Adle-mill; near to which is al&s;o a Roman camp, pretty entire. At Adde, five miles from Otley, are the remains of a Roman town, and camp. In Clifton lord&s;hip near Halifax, gal|lons of copper coins have been found. Near Bo|roughbridge are three huge &s;tones &s;et on end, in

form of pyramids, which the common people &s;up|po&s;e to have been pitched by the devil, and there|fore call them the devil's bolts, or arrows; but the learned look upon them as monuments of &s;ome victory, or Briti&s;h deities. At Gigle&s;wick, near the Ribble, is a &s;pring, which though thirty miles from the &s;ea, ebbs and flows thrice in an hour. Near Sandbeck is a yew-tree of a &s;hining colour, and of &s;o &s;ingular a form, that it is e&s;teem|ed a great curio&s;ity. The church at Laughton, near Rotheram, &s;tands on &s;o high a hill, and has a &s;teeple &s;o lofty, that it is &s;een fifty or &s;ixty miles off by the naked eye. At Kirkley, near Hali|fax, is the funeral monument of the famous Ro|binhood, with an in&s;cription. At Ferrybridge a battle was fought, in 1461, between the Yorki&s;ts and I anca&s;trians; and at the village of Brotherton near it, Margaret, wife to Edward I. was delivered of a &s;on, called from thence Thomas of Brother|ton, &s;he having been taken in labour while &s;he was hunting near it. The inhabitants of this village are chiefly employed in making lime of &s;tones brought from Tadca&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>The EAST RIDING, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>It is bounded on the &s;outh by the Humber; on the north and we&s;t by the Derwent, and the Ou&s;e; and on the ea&s;t, by the German ocean.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL, AIR, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The whole of this riding, which is the lea&s;t of the three, is very fruitful, except that called the Would, towards the middle, which, indeed, is but thinly inhabited, and produces but little corn, yet feeds great numbers of black cattle, &s;heep, and hor&s;es. The wool of the&s;e &s;heep is
<PB N="345" REF="3570">
very fine. The hills and downs, of which the Woulds con&s;i&s;t, yield al&s;o chalk, coal, free&s;tone, flints, fire&s;tones, &amp;c. The a&s;troites or &s;tar-&s;tones al&s;o are found about them. As to the air, the reader need not be told, that it is much purer and clearer upon the dry downs, than in the lower grounds, e&s;pecially along the Humber, and the &s;ea coa&s;t. This riding is well watered with brooks and rivers, the chief of which are the above|mentioned Humber, Derwent, Towlney, or Fowl|ne&s;s, Shellfleet, and Hull. The Humber is the receptacle of many other rivers, and is rather an arm of the &s;ea, than a river. Both the flood and ebb of this Ae&s;tuary is attended with a terrible roaring noi&s;e; and the navigation of it, e&s;pecially during the ebb, is dangerous to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with it.</P>
<P>The waters called Vip&s;ies, and, in the Woulds, Gip&s;es, are &s;uch as, after great gluts of rain, and la&s;ting wet weather, break out in different places of the Downs, &s;pouting up to a great height. The common people look upon them as the cer|tain forerunners of famine; and it mu&s;t be owned that wet &s;prings and &s;ummers generally occa&s;ion a &s;carcity of corn and other provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>That called the Manwater, between Bridling|ton and Horn&s;ey, is about a mile and a half long, and half a mile broad, pretty deep and always fre&s;h. It abounds with perch, pikes, and eels. Near Beverley is a &s;pring &s;aid to be good again&s;t the king's evil, cutaneous erup|tions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Though this riding is not de&s;titute of turf and wood, its principal fuel is pit-coal, with which it abounds.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the towns we &s;hall begin with the parliamentary boroughs, which are Beverly, King|&s;ton upon Hull, and Headdon.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="3580">
The fir&s;t is &s;aid to have been called antiently Beverlac, from the beavers, with which the Hull that runs by it then abounded. Here John de Beverly, archbi&s;hop of York, built a mona&s;tery, into which, turning monk, he retired about the year 721. Out of re&s;pect to him the kings of tho&s;e times are &s;aid to have granted &s;everal pri|veleges and immunities to the town, particularly that of a &s;anctuary, and exemption from tolls and cu&s;tom all over England. By a charter from queen Elizabeth, the town is governed by a mayor, a recorder, aldermen, &amp;c. In 1664, upon opening a grave in this place, a plate of lead was found with an in&s;cription, de|noting that in 1197 the bones of St. John de Beverly were interred there. The min&s;ter, or church, &s;o called, is very antient, large, and magnificent. In it are &s;everal monuments of the Perceys, earls of Northumberland; and in the windows of a little chapel, are the pictures of &s;ome of that family. The choir is paved with marble of different colours, and has a &s;eat in it called the Freed&s;tool, i. e. the Chair of Sanctuary. It is &s;aid to have been brought from Dunbar in Scotland, and was placed in the church for criminals. In this church are al&s;o the pictures of St. John, and king Athel&s;tan, and the tomb of two virgin &s;i&s;ters, who gave the town a field, into which any freeman may put three milch cows from Lady Day to Michaelmas. As a perpetual fund for keeping this church in repair, Sir Michael Wharton left by will four thou&s;and pounds. The liberties of the town are of great extant, and there is a court called the Provo&s;t-court for trying all civil cau&s;es ari&s;ing therein. Be&s;ides the min&s;ter, here is another beautiful church, with a workhou&s;e, &s;everal alms-hou&s;es, and a free-&s;chool endowed with two fellow&s;hips, &s;ix &s;cholar&s;hips,

and three exhibitions, in St. John's College, Cam|bridge. The town is &s;ituated in a fine &s;porting country, is above a mile in length, and has good company and a&s;&s;emblies. The &s;e&s;&s;ions for the riding are held here in a fine Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e; and here, which is an advantage that no county in England can boa&s;t of, be&s;ides York&s;hire and Mid|dle&s;ex, is an office for regi&s;tering all deeds af|fecting any lands, &amp;c. in the riding. Here are manufactures of oat-meal, malt, tanned leather, and bone-lace; and two weekly markets for corn, cattle, fi&s;h, fowl, and other provi&s;ions. The mar|ket-place is very large, and adorned with a beau|tiful cro&s;s. Its chief fair begins nine days before the a&s;cen&s;ion, in which the Londoners furni&s;h the country trade&s;men with wares by whole&s;ale. There are four commons belonging to the town, con|taining about a thou&s;and acres, into which every burge&s;s may put twelve cows, or other cattle. The Hull is about &s;ix furlongs from the town; but there is a cut or canal, called Beverly-Beck, by which &s;hips of good burden may get up to it.</P>
<P>King&s;ton upon Hull, commonly called Hull, from the &s;ituation on that river, had the name of King&s;ton from its founder Edward I. who made a harbour for it, and granted it &s;everal privileges. It &s;tands near the mouth of the Humber, where the Hull falls into it; was early fortified with walls on the land-&s;ide, and fir&s;t grew rich by its trade in Iceland-fi&s;h dried, and called &s;tock-fi&s;h, becau&s;e it was carried on by a joint-&s;tock. In the reign of Henry VI. it was made a county of it&s;elf, and in that of Henry VIII. erected into an honour. The mayor has two &s;words, one given by Richard II. and the other by Henry VIII. but only one of them is born be|fore him at a time. He has al&s;o a cap of mainte|nance, and an oar of lignum vitae, as a badge of

his admiralty-juri&s;diction within the limits of the Humber. The town is &s;aid by &s;ome to have been incorporated by Edward III. Here was an|tiently a &s;trong citadel. At pre&s;ent there are two churches, &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es, an exchange, a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, free-&s;chool, merchants-hall, &s;eve|ral ho&s;pitals, one of them is called Trinity-hou&s;e, in which many di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen and their widows are maintained. This hou&s;e is governed by twelve elder brothers, &s;ix a&s;&s;i&s;tants, two wardens, and two &s;tewards, who have a power to determine in &s;ea|affairs between the ma&s;ters and &s;ailors. There is al&s;o a large workhou&s;e for employing the poor. The town is large, clo&s;e built, populous, and one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the kingdom for trade, the cu&s;toms amounting to about 40,000 l. a year. Hull carries on a prodigious inland trade by the Humber, and many rivers that fall into it, by which it &s;upplies a great part of England with fo|reign goods, and brings back their commodities and manufactures for its own u&s;e, or for exporta|tion: in particular, va&s;t quantities of chee&s;e, lead, iron ware, corn, butter, and woollen manufactures are exported from hence; and the returns in iron, copper, hemp, flax, canvas, Ru&s;&s;ia linnen and yarn, wine, oil, and fruit, are very great. For the exportation of corn, no port in England comes up to it except that of London, with which and Holland the greate&s;t branches of its trade are carried on. No merchants have a better charac|ter or more credit than tho&s;e of Hull, which gives the title of duke to the noble family of Pierpoint.</P>
<P>Headon, Heddon, or Heydon, the third par|liamentary borough, is an antient but plea&s;ant well-built town, &s;tanding near the Humber, and formerly more con&s;iderable than it is at pre|&s;ent. Its decline has been owing partly to the neighbourhood of Hull, and partly to the lo&s;s of

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this riding is &s;aid to be purer, &s;harper, and more whole&s;ome, than that of the other two; but, as is generally the ca&s;e, the &s;oil of the greater part of it is wor&s;e: for tho&s;e tracts called Blackamoor and Richmond&s;hire, are very mountainous, wild, and barren; they yield, however, in &s;ome parts &s;tore of wood, lead, pit|coal, and other minerals, as marble, jet, cop|peras, and allum, and feed abundance of goats, deer, &s;tags, and &s;heep. The vallies, and the
<PB N="351" REF="3640">
bottoms of the hills, yield al&s;o gra&s;s and corn. The two vallies in this riding, called Swal&s;dale and Wene&s;dale, are very plea&s;ant and fertile, e&s;pecially the latter, which feeds va&s;t herds of cattle.</P>
<P>The rivers of this riding, which, be&s;ides the Derwent, parts it from the ea&s;t riding, are the Tees, Swale and Ure, abounding with &s;almon and fi&s;h; as the &s;ea coa&s;t does with turbots and her|rings in their &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The farmers upon the coa&s;t manure their land with &s;ee weed, of which they al&s;o make a great deal of what is called kelp; and is u&s;ed in the allum works, e&s;pecially about Whitby.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the famous Scarborough &s;pa, there are &s;everal other mineral waters in this riding, par|ticularly at Oun&s;berry Hill.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to the towns, beginning with the parliamentary ones, which are tho&s;e of Scarborough, Malton, Thir&s;k, and North-Al|lerton.</P>
<P>Scarborough has its name from its &s;ituation on a &s;teep rock, and is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the &s;ea. It is a pretty hand&s;ome town, though antient, has a good harbour, and not a few &s;hips, which are chiefly employed in carrying coals from Newca&s;tle to London. On the north ea&s;t is a high &s;teep rock, with a plain on the top of nineteen acres of good meadow, and a &s;pring, where antiently was a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, built by Henry II. The harbour here on account of its &s;i|tuation, and likelihood of being &s;erviceable to &s;hips in &s;tormy weather, being a public concern, has been much enlarged and improved by virtue of an act of parliament, and a duty laid upon coals from Newca&s;tle and Sunderland, for keeping it in repair. This town has a large &s;hare in the fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t, where not only herrings in
<PB N="352" REF="3650">
great numbers; but al&s;o cod, ling, haddocks, whitings, hake, mackarels, turbots, and &s;e|veral other kinds of fi&s;h, are caught. But what greatly contributes to the flouri&s;hing condition of this town, are the chalybeate waters in its neigh|bourhood, which are much frequented in &s;ummer. They are purgative and diuretic, and much of the &s;ame nature as tho&s;e of Pyrmont in Germany. There are very good accommodations for tho&s;e that drink them, and no want of amu&s;ements. Be&s;ides, as there is an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, and the &s;ituation of the town is very ro|mantic, walking and riding are very delightful in fine weather. There is an ho&s;pital here for poor &s;eamen, and their widows. It gives the title of earl to the family of Lumley, and is a corpora|tion, governed by two bailiffs, a recorder, and common-council.</P>
<P>Malton, a populous borough, though no cor|poration. It &s;tands in a fruitful vale, called Rhy|dale, on the Derwent, over which it has a good &s;tone bridge. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle, &s;ome remains of which are &s;till vi&s;ible, and al&s;o a mo|na&s;tery. As it &s;tands on the road from Scar|borough to York, it is a great thoroughfare, and has good inns. The river Derwent, which is navigable to it, divides it into two parts, called Old and New Malton. Be&s;ides two fairs, it has two weekly markets, of which, that on Sa|turday is the be&s;t in the county, for hor&s;es, black cattle, tools for hu&s;bandry, and other commo|dities. The right hon. the earl of Scarborough is lord of the manor. The town is governed by a bailiff.</P>
<P>Thru&s;ke, or Thir&s;ke, had antiently a very &s;trong ca&s;tle. It is a corporation, governed by a bailiff, and burgage-holders. The bailiff is cho&s;en by the burge&s;&s;es, and &s;worn in by the

<P>North Allerton, or Alverton, an antient town &s;ituated in a champaign fruitful country, on the river Wi&s;ke. It &s;tands on the great northern road, and has a good market, for hor&s;es, corn, and cattle. At its fairs, incredible numbers of oxen are bought up, and carried as far as the fens of Lincoln&s;hire, and the I&s;le of Fly to be fat|tened. In the fourth year of king Stephen, Da|vid, king of Scots, was defeated here at the battle of the Standard.

<P>Richmond: this town gives name to that part of the county called Richmond&s;hire, and is its capital; including the &s;uburbs without the walls, it is pretty large. It had antiently a &s;trong ca&s;tle built by Alan its fir&s;t earl, from whom it al&s;o had its name, which &s;ignifies a rich mount. It &s;tands on the Swale, over which it has a good &s;tone bridge, and is a hand&s;ome town, well in|habited, built, and paved. Its privileges and im|munities are con&s;iderable, and &s;o is its trade in &s;tockings, and woollen caps. It is a corporation governed by a mayor, who is cho&s;en by the ma|jority of thirteen companies of trading freemen, a recorder, twelve aldermen, twenty-four com|mon council-men, and their officers; and it gives the title of duke to a de&s;cendant of the noble lord Charles Lenox, a natural &s;on of king Charles II. Its fairs are numerous, be&s;ides its weekly market.</P>
<P>Whitby, i. e. the White Town, &s;tands on the river E&s;k, where it falls into the &s;ea. It is a well built town, and has a commodious harbour, and a great number of &s;hips, be&s;ides tho&s;e that are

built for the coal trade. A good deal of corn and butter are &s;ent from hence to London, and &s;ometimes to Holland. A council is &s;aid to have been held here, Anno 663, for &s;ettling the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter, &s;ome contending for the Roman celebration, and others for that of the Britons. Here al&s;o &s;ome curious Roman coins have been dup up.</P>
<P>To the we&s;t of this town, lies that tract, called Cleveland, from the &s;teep cliffs in it, which gives the title of duke to a de&s;cendant of a natural &s;on of Charles II. by the duche&s;s of Cleveland.</P>
<P>Gi&s;borough, a hand&s;ome town, plea&s;antly &s;i|tuated about four miles from the mouth of the Tees, where it has a harbour. Here was formerly a noble abbey, founded about the year 1119, by Robert de Bruce, a Norman, who was lord of the town, and ance&s;tor to the renowned Robert de Bruce, king of Scotland. The air is &s;aid to be very healthy, and the &s;oil fruitful. The hills about this town and Whitby abound with veins of iron, allum-earth of &s;everal colours, ochre, and murrey. On the &s;ea coa&s;ts are &s;tones that look like bra&s;s, and droves of &s;eals are often &s;een ba&s;king in the &s;un, and &s;leeping on the rocks, when one of them always &s;tands centinel, and upon the approach of danger, gives the alarm, by plunging her&s;elf into the &s;ea. On this coa&s;t al&s;o is a village, a bay, and three little hills, which take their names from the famous out-law, Robin Hood, whom John Major, a Scotchman, &s;tyles the mo&s;t kind and obliging robber, and the prince of his profe&s;&s;ion. The little hills are called his butts, and are about a quarter of a mile a&s;under.</P>

The Roman cau&s;ey, called Leeming Lane, for twenty miles together, pa&s;&s;es through it. As the neighbouring country is noted for breeding fine hor&s;es, it is full of dealers in them, commonly called jockeys.</P>
<P>Midlam, or Middleham, &s;tands on the river Ure. It has a good manufacture of cloth, and formerly had a &s;trong ca&s;tle, in which Edward, prince of Wales, only &s;on of king Richard the Third, was born.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Its length is between thirty and forty miles, its breadth about thirty, and its circumference about one hundred and thirty-four. It is an inland county, of an almo&s;t circular form, and contains eight hundred and ninety thou&s;and acres, one hundred and thirty-nine thou&s;and inhabitants, and fifteen hundreds, in which are one hun|dred and &s;eventy pari&s;hes, and fifteen market|towns. It makes a part of three bi&s;hoptics, viz. Hereford&s;hire, Coventry and Litchfield, and St. A&s;aph. Some part of it lies on the north, and &s;ome on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Severn. Be&s;ides the Severn, it is al&s;o watered by the Ti&s;idiane, or Fafidiane, as it is called in Welch, which flows from the mountains of Radnor&s;hire, and by the Tern, which has its ri&s;e and name from one of tho&s;e pools, called tearnes, in Stafford&s;hire. All the&s;e abound with fi&s;h, e&s;pecially trouts, pikes, lampreys, graylings, carp, and eels.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, e&s;pecially upon the hills, with which the county abounds, is very whole&s;ome. There is as great a diver&s;ity of &s;oil, as in mo&s;t other counties. On the hills, where it is poor, is very good pa&s;ture for &s;heep; and in the low grounds, where it is very rich, along the Se|vern in particular, there is plenty of gra&s;s for hay and black cattle, with all &s;orts of corn. No county is better provided with fuel than this, having in it many inexhau&s;tible pits of coal; and al&s;o mines of lead and iron. Over mo&s;t of the coal-pits in
<PB N="359" REF="3720">
this county lies a &s;tratum, or layer of blacki&s;h, porous rock, of which, by grinding and boiling, they make pitch and tar, which are rather better than the common &s;ort, for caulking &s;hips, as they do not crack, but always continue clo&s;e and &s;mooth. Quarries of lime-&s;tone, and iron-&s;tone, are com|mon enough in the county; and the &s;oil in many places is a reddi&s;h clay.</P>
<P>As it lies upon the borders of Wales, it was anciently full of ca&s;tles and walled towns. On the &s;ide next that country there was an almo&s;t continued line of ca&s;tles, to guard the county again&s;t the inroads and depredations of the Welch. The borders here, as tho&s;e between England and Scotland, were called Marches, and there were certain noblemen, entitled <HI>barones marchiae, mar|chiones de marchia Walliae,</HI> lords marchers, or mar|qui&s;&s;es of the marches of Wales, who were ve&s;ted with a &s;ort of palatine juri&s;diction, held courts of ju&s;tice to determine controver&s;ies, and enjoyed many privileges and immunities, the better to enable and encourage them to protect the county again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Welch, and to main|tain order among&s;t the borderers; but they often abu&s;ed their power, and were the greate&s;t of ty|rants.</P>
<P>As to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government of the county, the far greater part, namely, all that be|longs to the bi&s;hoprics of Hereford, and of Litch|field and Coventry, is under the juri&s;diction and vi&s;itation of the archdeacon of Shrew&s;bury, or Salop, and is divided into &s;everal deaneries.</P>
<P>The Oxford circuit includes in it this county, which &s;ends twelve members to parliament, viz. two for the &s;hire, and two for each of the follow|ing towns, Shrew&s;bury, Ludlow, Wenlock, and Bi&s;hop's-Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="3730">
Shrew&s;bury. This town, the metropolis of the county, grew up out of the ruins of Uriconium, anciently a city, now a village, called Wroxeter, about four miles from it. The Saxons called it Scrobbes-Berig, from the &s;hrubs that grew about it, and from thence the pre&s;ent name of Shrew&s;|bury is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been formed. It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon a hill near the Severn, over which there are two hand&s;ome bridges. It was a place of good note in the Saxon times; after which it was granted by William the Con|queror, together with the title of earl and mo&s;t of the county, to Roger de Montgomery, who built a ca&s;tle upon the north-&s;ide of it, where the Severn, that encompa&s;&s;es it on all &s;ides, leaves an opening. His &s;on Robert built al&s;o a wall acro&s;s this neck of land, when he revolted from Henry I. We learn from doom&s;day-book, that at that time when a widow of this town married, &s;he paid twenty &s;hillings to the king, and a virgin ten. The above-mentioned Roger founded al&s;o and endowed here a Benedictine mona&s;tery, and a col|legiate church. When old age came upon him, he quirted the world, and &s;pent the re&s;t of his days as a monk in the abbey, and, when he died, was interred in its church. From the hi&s;tory of this church and mona&s;tery, it appears, that eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefices about that time were hereditary. The abbey became &s;o rich afterwards, that the abbot was mitred, and &s;at in parliament. Be&s;ides this abbey, in after-times there were three others, viz. a Franci&s;can, Dominican, and Augu&s;tin, and likewi&s;e two collegiate churches; one de|dicated to Saint Chad, and the other to Saint Mary. In the conte&s;t between the empre&s;s Maud and Stephen, this town and its governor William Fitz-Allan, &s;ided with the empre&s;s. In Henry the Third's time, a part of it was burnt down by
<PB N="361" REF="3740">
the Welch; and in Richard the Second's reign, a parliament was held in it. At a place called Battlefield, near this town, Henry Piercy the younger, &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur, was killed in an en|gagement with Henry IV. again&s;t whom he had rebelled. The king afterwards built a chapel upon the &s;pot, and &s;ettled two ma&s;s-prie&s;ts, to pray for the &s;ouls of the &s;lain. Two of Edward the Fourth's &s;ons were born here, namely Richard, &s;tiled duke of York, whom Perkin Warbeck af|terwards per&s;onated, and who was murdered in the Tower; and George Plantagenet, who died before his brothers. Here fir&s;t broke out the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s, which carried off great numbers &s;o &s;uddenly, that tho&s;e, who were &s;eized with it, either died or recovered in the &s;pace of twenty|four hours. In the beginning of the civil wars, king Charles I. came hither, and formed an army, with which he marched towards London; but was met by the parliament's forces at Edgehill. He continued here from the twentieth of Septem|ber, to the twelfth of October; during which time he was joined by prince Rupert, and many of the gentry and nobility of the&s;e parts. This town anciently gave title of earl to the Montgo|merys, and afterwards to the Talbots, by whom it is &s;till retained. Here is a free grammar-&s;chool, with three ma&s;ters, and &s;everal u&s;hers, well en|dowed by Edward VI. and queen Elizabeth, and not inferior to many colleges in the univer&s;ities. It has a good library and chapel, and there are &s;everal &s;cholar&s;hips appropriated to it in the uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge. Here are al&s;o &s;everal ho&s;|pitals, alms-hou&s;es, and charity-&s;chools. This town is one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in England, having two great weekly markets for corn, cat|tle, and provi&s;ions, and another for Welch cot|tons and flannels; of which great quantities are
<PB N="362" REF="3750">
&s;old. A great trade is carried on with the Welch, who bring their commodities hither, as to the common mart of both nations. The town is large and well built, and the &s;ituation extreme|ly plea&s;ant. There is a very beautiful walk called the Quarry, between the town walls and the Se|vern, delightfully &s;haded with rows of lime-trees, &s;o that it is not inferior to the Mall in St. James's park. The town is al&s;o noted for its gallantry and politene&s;s, being full of gentry, and for whom there are always balls and a&s;&s;emblies once a week all the year round. Here is a fine hou&s;e and gardens, which belonged to the earl of Bradford; and in the neighbourhood at Wroxeter, the Roman highway, called Watling|&s;treet, may be &s;een for &s;everal miles, where Ro|man coins are frequently found. In Shrew&s;bury are twelve incorporated trading companies; and the corporation has a power to try even capital cau&s;es of it&s;elf, except high trea&s;on. Thigh|bones of dead men have been found here a yard long, and teeth three inches round, and three long.</P>
<P>Bruges, Bridgenorth, or Brugmorfe, &s;tanding on the river Severn, with a fine &s;tone-bridge of &s;even arches over it, upon the building of &s;ome other bridge to the &s;outh of it, took the name of Bridgenorth, having been called before only Bridge. It had anciently a ca&s;tle and walls, which are now in ruins. It &s;tands plea&s;antly as well as commodiou&s;ly for trade, on both &s;ides the Severn, and is divided into the upper and lower towns; the former &s;tanding on a hill, from whence there is a charming pro&s;pect. The town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of three &s;treets, and has a great trade carried on both by land and water. Here is a great manufacture of &s;tockings; and fairs, re&s;orted to from all parts of the kingdom, for hor&s;es, black cattle, &s;heep,
<PB N="363" REF="3760">
butter, chee&s;e, bacon, linnen cloth, hops, and many other commodities. There were &s;everal reli|gious hou&s;es formerly in this place; and now there are two churches, and a free-&s;chool for the &s;ons of the burge&s;&s;es, which has eighteen &s;cholar&s;hips in the univer&s;ity of Oxford. The town is well &s;up|plied with water by leaden pipes, and is a corpo|ration, con&s;i&s;ting of two bailiffs, and other infe|rior officers.</P>
<P>Ludlow &s;tands at the conflux of the Teme and Corve, and had formerly a &s;trong ca&s;tle, inclo&s;ed by a wall a mile in compa&s;s. The pre&s;ident of the council of the marches, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Henry VIII. generally kept his courts in it, by which the town was much benefited, the&s;e courts not having been aboli&s;hed 'till the fir&s;t of William and Mary. Its neighbourhood to Wales makes it a great tho|roughfare, and engages many of the Welch to &s;end their children of both &s;exes to it for educa|tion. It was incorporated by Edward IV. and among other privileges, has that of trying and executing criminals within it&s;elf. It is one of the neate&s;t towns in England, with walls, and &s;even gates. From the ca&s;tle on the top of the hill, on which the town &s;tands, is a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;|pect. In an apartment of the outer-gatehou&s;e of the palace, Samuel Butler is &s;aid to have written the fir&s;t part of Hudibras. Here Arthur, elder brother to Henry VIII. died, and was buried in the choir of the church. Without the town on the north-&s;ide &s;tood anciently a rich priory; of which there are hardly any remains. The river Teme here has a good bridge over it, and dams or wears acro&s;s it. In the church are &s;ome old monuments of the lords pre&s;ident, &amp;c. The neighbouring country is exceeding plea&s;ant, e&s;pe|cially that part called Corve's-Dale, or the valley along the Corve.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="3770">
Great Wenlock is a corporation town, con&s;i&s;ting of a bailiff, recorder, and two other ju&s;tices of the peace. Here was anciently a nunnery; but now it is noted only for tobacco-pipe clay, and lime&s;tone.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop's-Ca&s;tle. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a bailiff, recorder, and fifteen aldermen, out of whom the bailiff is annually cho&s;en. It belonged formerly to the bi&s;hop of Hereford, whence it had its name; but queen Elizabeth gave it to Sir Chri&s;topher Hatton. It has many privileges, and its fairs are much frequented by the Welch, as well as its market, which is noted for black cattle and other commodities.</P>
<P>Other places that merit any notice be&s;ides the parliamentary boroughs, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>Witchurch, though large and populous, has lit|tle trade, &s;tands on the borders of Che&s;hire. When Charles I. came to Shrew&s;bury, it is &s;aid to have rai&s;ed a complete regiment for his &s;ervice. A|mong other monuments of the Talbots, there was in Cambden's time one of Sir John Talbot, the fir&s;t earl of Shrew&s;bury of that name, &s;o renowned for his valour in France, that he got the name of the Engli&s;h Achilles.</P>
<P>O&s;we&s;try, or O&s;walde&s;try, took its name from O&s;wald, king of the Northumbrians, who at this place was defeated and &s;lain by Penda, king of the Mercians. Here is a great market for Welch flannels and friezes. The church is dedicated to St. O&s;wald, and the town governed by two bailiffs and burge&s;&s;es. St. Andrew's fair la&s;ts four days. The town is enclo&s;ed with a wall and ditch, and has a &s;mall ca&s;tle. There is a grammar|&s;chool, and a charity-&s;chool both for boys and girls. In the latter, to excite emulation, prizes are often propo&s;ed to &s;uch as acquit them&s;elves be&s;t in the different branches of their education; as
<PB N="365" REF="3780">
for the girls, a &s;mock to the be&s;t &s;pinner, a pair of &s;tockings to the be&s;t knitter, a head-dre&s;s to the be&s;t &s;emp&s;tre&s;s; and for both boys and girls, a bible to the be&s;t reader, a copy or cypher-book to the be&s;t writer or cypherer.</P>
<P>Wem is a con&s;iderable town at the head of the river Rodan. In the year 1676, great part of it was con&s;umed by fire. It formerly gave the title of baron to the families of Butler and Ferrers, and afterwards to the never to be for|gotten Jefferies, whom that weak bigotted prince James II. advanced to the dignities of lord chancellor, and baron of Wem. The dete&s;ted memory of this inhuman judge can reflect no ho|nour upon this town; but that of Mr. Wycher|ley, who was a native of it, and &s;o celebrated a dramatic poet, undoubtedly mu&s;t. Another emi|nent per&s;on, who was a native of it, was Sir Tho|mas Adams, lord-mayor of London in 1645, and liberally endowed a free-&s;chool for the children of the town.</P>
<P>Newport. Here al&s;o a &s;chool was founded by a gentleman of the &s;ame name, and a native of the &s;ame town, who had made his fortune in Lon|don. He laid out &s;even thou&s;and pounds upon a &s;chool-hou&s;e, a hou&s;e for the ma&s;ter and u&s;her, a garden of an acre to each hou&s;e, two acres for the boys to play in, &s;ixty pounds a year to the ma&s;ter, now &s;aid to be rai&s;ed to an hundred pounds, and thirty pounds to the u&s;her. The place of ma&s;ter of the &s;chool is in the gift of the haberda&s;hers com|pany of London. The &s;ame gentleman built al&s;o an alms-hou&s;e, and gave five hundred pounds towards building the town-hou&s;e. The town is pretty large, and &s;tands on the borders of Staf|ford&s;hire.</P>
<P>Cherburg. This place &s;tands near the Severn, and gives title of baron to the de&s;cendant of

Sir Edward Herbert, &s;o created by Charles I. It had formerly a ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Rowton is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Rutunium of Antoninus. It is &s;ituated upon the we&s;tern bor|ders of the &s;hire, near the Severn.</P>
<P>Caer-Caradack. This is a &s;teep hill at the conflux of the Teme and Clun, on which is a large camp, &s;uppo&s;ed to be that from whence the brave Caractacus, after an ob&s;tinate and gallant re&s;i&s;tance, was driven by O&s;torius and the Roman legions, and for the taking of which a triumph was decreed to O&s;torius. In the neighbourhood are two camps, one of which appears to be Roman, and the other Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>Clee-hill, ten miles from Bridgenorth. On this hill are the remains of an ancient camp. It is noted al&s;o for producing the be&s;t pit-coal, and for &s;ome veins of iron.</P>
<P>Pitchford is near Wenlock, and had its name from a &s;pring, on the &s;urface of which is found a liquid bitumen, which is &s;kimmed off, and u&s;ed as pitch. Whether it be good again&s;t the falling-&s;ickne&s;s, and for healing wounds, as &s;ome pre|tend, is what we cannot take upon us to affirm.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbury, near Bridgenorth, is thought to be the Bramonium, or Bravonium, of Antoni|nus.</P>
<P>Acton-Burnel, near Wenlock. Here, in the reign of Edward I. was held a parliament, when the lords &s;at in the ca&s;tle, and the commons in a barn, which is &s;aid to be &s;till &s;tanding, and then belonged to the abbot of the mona&s;tery of St. Pe|ter and St. Paul, in Shrew&s;bury, now to&mdash;Prince, e&s;quire. The Burnels were anciently lords of this place, whence it was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the addition of their &s;urname.</P>
<P>Wrekin-hill is remarkably high, and &s;tands within a mile of Wroxeter, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="367" REF="3800">
be the ancient Uriconium. The remains of Roman buildings and fortifications, now called the Old Works of Wroxeter, are &s;till to be &s;een. It &s;tands on the Severn, near its junction with the Tern, and appears to have been about three miles in com|pa&s;s, &s;urrounded with a &s;trong wall and ditch, &s;ome part of which is &s;till very deep. Its pre&s;ent name is probably a contraction of Wrekincea&s;ter.</P>
<P>Bro&s;ely, near Wenlock. Here is a well, the water of which being lighted burns like the &s;pirit of wine, or brandy, and boils any thing that is &s;et over it much &s;ooner than an ordinary fire. If green boughs, or any thing el&s;e that is combu&s;|tible, are laid over it, they are pre&s;ently con|&s;umed to a&s;hes. Yet it is &s;urprizing that the wa|ter, as &s;oon as the fire is put out, feels extremely cold; and that a piece of fle&s;h broiled in the flame, has not the lea&s;t ta&s;te of &s;ulphur.</P>
<P>White Ladies, in the pari&s;h of Tonge. Here was anciently a famous nunnery, and in the neighbourhood is the grove of Bo&s;cobel, and in that the royal oak, in which king Charles II. hid him&s;elf for &s;everal days after the battle of Worce&s;ter. It is now &s;urrounded with a brick|wall; but has been almo&s;t all cut away by tho&s;e, whom curio&s;ity brought to &s;ee it. It is &s;aid, that after the re&s;toration the king paid it a vi&s;it, and gathered &s;ome of its acorns, which he carried to London, planted in the park, or gardens, and u&s;ed to water him&s;elf. While he &s;at in the oak, &s;ome of the parliament &s;oldiers pa&s;&s;ed through the grove, clo&s;e under the tree, in que&s;t of him.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>The length is reckoned at forty miles, the breadth at twenty-&s;ix, and the circumference at one hundred and forty-one. It contains five hun|dreds, one hundred and fifty pari&s;hes, eight hun|dred and ten thou&s;and acres, one city, and eighteen market-towns.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The air, except in tho&s;e parts that are called the Moorlands and Woodlands, and about the mines, is good, e&s;pecially upon the hills, where it is accounted very fine: but the &s;oil in the northern mountainous part is not &s;o fertile. In the middle, where it is watered by the Trent, the third river in England, it is both fruitful and plea&s;ant, being a mixture of arable and meadow grounds. In the &s;outh, it abounds not only with corn, but with mines of iron, and with pits of coal.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS and MERES.</HEAD>
<P>The other rivers of this county, be&s;ides the Trent, which runs almo&s;t through the middle of it, and abounds with &s;almon, are the Dove and Tame, both which are well &s;tored with fi&s;h. In
<PB N="370" REF="3830">
this county are al&s;o a great many lakes, or meres and pools, as they are called; which having &s;treams either running into them or from them, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be of any great prejudice to the air, and yield plenty of fi&s;h.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MEDICINAL WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>In divers parts of the county are medicinal wa|ters, impregnated with different &s;orts of minerals, and con&s;equently of different qualities and vir|tues; as tho&s;e at Hynts and Bresford-hou&s;e, which are mixed with bitumen; tho&s;e at Inge&s;tre, Cod|&s;al-wood, and Willough-bridge park, which are &s;ulphureous. Of the &s;aline kind, are the Brine|pits at Chertley, Ep&s;on, Pen&s;net clo&s;e, of which very good &s;alt is made. There is a well at New|ca&s;tle under Line, that is &s;aid to cure the king's|evil; another called Elder-well near Blemhill, &s;aid to be good for &s;ore eyes; and a third called the Spa, near Wolverhampton.</P>
<P>Great flocks of &s;heep are bred in this county, e&s;pecially in the moor-lands, or mountains of the northern part of it; but the wool is &s;aid to be &s;omewhat coar&s;er than that of many other counties. Of this wool, however, they make a variety of manufactures, particularly felts. In the low|grounds along the rivers are rich pa&s;tures for black cattle; and va&s;t quantities of butter and chee&s;e are made there. In the middle and &s;outhern parts not only grain of all kinds, but a great deal of hemp and flax are rai&s;ed. This county produces al&s;o lead, copper, iron, marble, alaba&s;ter, mill|&s;tones, lime&s;tones, coal, &s;alt, marles of &s;everal &s;orts and colours, brick-earth, fullers earth, pot|ters-clay; particularly a &s;ort u&s;ed in the gla&s;s ma|nufacture at Amblecot, and &s;old at &s;even-pence a bu&s;hel; tobacco-pipe clay; a &s;ort of reddi&s;h earth

<P>For fuel the county is well &s;upplied with turf, peat, and coal of &s;everal &s;orts, as cannel-coal, peacock-coal, and pit-coal. The cannel-coal burns as bright as the drie&s;t wood, and is &s;u&s;cep|tible of a fine poli&s;h. The peacock-coal is &s;o called, becau&s;e, when turned to the light, it di&s;|plays all the colours of the peacock's tail, but it is fitter for the forge than the kitchen. Of the pit-coal there is an inexhau&s;tible &s;tore: it burns into white a&s;hes, and leaves no &s;uch cinder as that of the Newca&s;tle coal. It is not u&s;ed for malt|ing, till it is charred, and in that &s;tate it makes admirable winter fuel for a chamber.</P>
<P>This county is in the dioce&s;e of Litchfield and Coventry, and the Oxford circuit. It &s;ends eight members to parliament; namely, two for the county, two for the city of Litchfield, two for Stafford, and two for Newca&s;tle under Line.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Litchfield &s;tands low, about three miles from the Trent. Its ancient name is &s;aid to have been Licidfield, &s;ignifying a field of carca&s;&s;es, from a great number of Chri&s;tians having, as it is pre|tended, &s;uffered martyrdom here in the per&s;ecu|tion under Diocle&s;ian. Though the bi&s;hop has his &s;ee here, yet he is denominated of Litchfield and Coventry. It is divided into two parts by a rivulet and a kind of &s;hallow lake, over which are two cau&s;eways, with &s;luices. It is a long &s;trag|gling place; but has &s;ome very hand&s;ome hou&s;es,
<PB N="372" REF="3850">
and well paved, clean &s;treets. That part on the &s;outh &s;ide of the rivulet is called the city, and the other the clo&s;e, becau&s;e it is enclo&s;ed with a wall, and a deep dry ditch. The city is much the large&s;t, and contains &s;everal public &s;tructures; among others, an ho&s;pital, a gaol for felons and debtors apprehended within its liberties, which are ten or twelve miles in compa&s;s, and, with the city, make a di&s;tinct county. Here is al&s;o a free-&s;chool; there are three churches, and formerly there was a ca&s;tle, of which there is nothing now remaining. Within the clo&s;e &s;tands the cathedral, a very magnificent &s;tructure. Its front, or por|tico, is hardly to be paralleled in England; and it has three &s;pires, exceeding lofty. The choir is paved with alaba&s;ter, and cannel-coal. Here al&s;o &s;tand the palaces of the dean and bi&s;hop, and the hou&s;es of the prebendaries, which are very hand&s;ome. The town is a great thorough|fare to the north-we&s;t counties, and is governed by two bailiffs, twenty-four burge&s;&s;es, a recor|der, a &s;heriff, a &s;teward, and other officers. Of the ancient bi&s;hops of this &s;ee, the mo&s;t eminent was St. Chad, who was canonized for his &s;anctity, and, as Bede writeth, was wont to read and pray in private, as often as he had lei&s;ure from preach|ing the word of God. The city gives title of earl to the family of Lee, &s;o created by Charles II. in 1674.</P>
<P>Stafford &s;tands on the river Sow, over which it has a &s;tone-bridge. It is well built and paved, and had formerly a ca&s;tle and walls. Here both the a&s;&s;izes and quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions are held, by virtue of a &s;tatute of queen Elizabeth. The town gives title of earl to a popi&s;h branch of the family of Howard, and &s;till retains the cu&s;tom, called Bo|rough-Engli&s;h. Here are two hand&s;ome churches, a free-&s;chool, a &s;pacious market-place, and a
<PB N="373" REF="3860">
flouri&s;hing cloth manufacture. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, ten aldermen, twenty common-council-men, a town-clerk, and two &s;erjeants at mace. The barony of this town is thought to have been once the large&s;t in England, containing eighty villages and &s;ixty knights fees.</P>
<P>Newca&s;tle under Lime, or Line. This town &s;tands on a branch of the Trent, and the ca&s;tle was called new, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another older, at Che&s;terton under Lime. It has a ma|nufacture of hats and cloth, and &s;everal great fairs for all &s;orts of cattle, and wool. The cor|poration con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, two ju&s;tices, two bailiffs, and twenty-four capital burge&s;&s;es, and has the privilege to determine actions under forty pounds value. The town is well &s;upplied with fuel; for there are pits of coal on all &s;ides of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the parliamentary towns. The other places worth mentioning are the&s;e.</P>
<P>Wolverhampton. The name of this town was originally Wulfrune's Hampton, the fir&s;t part of which it had from Wulfruna, &s;i&s;ter to king Edgar, who founded a priory here at her reque&s;t. This place, by its high &s;ituation, enjoys a pure air, though in the neighbourhood of coal-mines; but &s;uffers &s;ome inconvenience from the want of a &s;ufficient &s;upply of water, having only four weak &s;prings, of different qualities as it would &s;eem from the different u&s;es to which they are ap|plied, as is evident from their names, which are Pudding-Well, Wa&s;hing-Well, Meat-Well, and Hor&s;e-Well. The name of the fir&s;t may need &s;ome explanation. By pudding here is meant tripe, a &s;ignification different enough from what it has in &s;ome other parts of the kingdom. From the&s;e wells the water is brought in leathern budgets on hor&s;e-back. The town is populous,
<PB N="374" REF="3870">
well-built, and well paved, has a collegiate church annexed to the dean and chapter of Wind&s;or, &s;e|veral charity &s;chools, a weekly market, and a fair. But the chief &s;upport of the place are the lock|&s;miths, reckoned the mo&s;t ingenious in Eng|land.

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Che&s;terfield wall near Litchfield, was, mo&s;t probably, the <HI>Etocetum</HI> of Antoninus; for here the place exhibits the remains of &s;ome antient town, and the di&s;tances mentioned in the Iti|nerary agree be&s;t with it. At Checkley, in the church-yard, are three &s;tones, erected &s;pire|wi&s;e, on two of which are images. The tradition of the place is that there was an engagement in a neighbouring field, called Naked-field, in which three bi&s;hops were &s;lain, who&s;e monuments the&s;e &s;tones are. At Wrotte&s;ley, near Wolverhampton, are the ruins of &s;ome old city; and at Kinfare, in the neighbourhood, are tho&s;e of a fortifica|tion. At Dudley Ca&s;tle, near Wolverhampton, in the hall is a table, made of a &s;ingle oak plank, which mea&s;ures &s;eventeen yards in length, and a yard in breadth. It was at fir&s;t &s;even yards nine inches more; but the&s;e were cut off, to &s;uit it to the hall. This tree was of an enormous &s;ize, and grew in the New Park of Dudley. The ca&s;|tle is &s;aid to be as old as the year 700. It is cut out of a rock upon the top of a hill, whence there is a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. At Abbot's or Apewood Ca&s;tle, near Sea&s;don on the edge of Shrop&s;hire, is an antient fortification, &s;up|po&s;ed to be Briti&s;h. Upon A&s;wood-heath, in the

<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>Both the air and &s;oil of this county in general are good. In the low grounds e&s;pecially, the &s;oil is rich, and produces plenty of corn and gra&s;s. Towards Stafford&s;hire and Derby&s;hire, it is &s;omewhat hilly, but not unfruitful. All over the county are &s;pots of ground called mo&s;&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting of a black, fat, unctuous kind of earth, which they cut into oblong &s;quares, called peats, and dry in the &s;un for fuel. In the&s;e mo&s;&s;es are often found trunks of firs, &s;ometimes &s;everal feet under ground, which the country people u&s;e both for fuel and candles. In this county are al&s;o many meres or lakes, and pools, all well &s;tored with fi&s;h, be&s;ides the rivers Mer&s;ee, Weaver, and Dee, which la&s;t falls into a creek of the Iri&s;h &s;ea at Che&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="3920">
This county is al&s;o well wooded, having, be|&s;ides what grows in other places, the fore&s;ts of Delamere and Macclesfield, which are very large: but what it is principally noted for, is chee&s;e; though much of what is &s;old under that name in London and other places comes from Wales. The true Che&s;hire chee&s;e is generally much e&s;teemed, though many prefer that of Gloce&s;ter to it, and that of Cheddar in Somer&s;et&s;hire to both.</P>
<P>A great deal of &s;alt is made in this county, con|cerning which we &s;hall be more particular, when we come to the places where it is made.</P>
<P>William the Conqueror erected this county into a Palatinate, or county palatine, in favour of Hugh Lupus, his nephew, to whom he granted the &s;ame &s;overeignty and juri&s;diction in it, as he had him&s;elf in the re&s;t of the kingdom; for he gave it him, as the charter expre&s;&s;es it, to hold to him and his heirs, as freely by the &s;word as the king held the crown of England. By virtue of this grant, Che&s;ter enjoyed all &s;overeign juri&s;dic|tion within its own precincts; and that in &s;o high a degree, that the earls held parliaments, con&s;i&s;t|ing of their barons and tenants, and were not bound by the Engli&s;h acts of parliament; but this exorbitant power of the palatinates was at la&s;t reduced by Henry VIII. however all ca&s;es and crimes, except tho&s;e of error, foreign plea, foreign voucher and high trea&s;on, are &s;till heard and determined within the &s;hire.</P>
<P>The earls were antiently &s;uperiors of the whole county, and all the landholders were mediately or immediately their va&s;&s;als, and under the like &s;overeign allegiance and fealty to them, as they were to the kings of England; but the earldom was united to the crown by Edward III. &s;ince which time, the elde&s;t &s;ons of the kings of

England have always been earls of Che&s;ter, as well as princes of Wales.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Che&s;ter, commonly called We&s;t-Che&s;ter, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from many other Che&s;ters in the kingdom, is a very antient city, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been founded by the Romans. It plainly appears to have been a Roman &s;tation by the many in&s;criptions, altars, coins, pavements of chequer work, vaults, and the foundations of va&s;t buildings, that have been and &s;till are di&s;|covered in and about the town. This was among the la&s;t places that the Romans quitted; and here the Britons maintained their liberty long after the Saxons had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t of the i&s;land; for it did not become &s;ubject to the Saxons, till about a hundred and fifty years after their fir&s;t landing in England; nor was it long held by them then, but was &s;oon retaken by the Britons, who remained ma&s;ters of it, till they were finally di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it by Egbert, the fir&s;t Saxon monarch, in the year 826. Here Edgar, in the 13th year of his reign, is &s;aid to have received the homage of the petty princes of Wales, of Man, and Cumberland, and al&s;o of the king of Scotland for the dominions he held of him in England. We are told that he made the&s;e princes row him up and down the Dee, and it is not unlikely, as they were not then in a condition to di&s;pute his com|mands, being at a di&s;tance from home, and en|tirely in his power. King Edward III. made the Black Prince earl of Che&s;ter by patent, and ever
<PB N="381" REF="3940">
&s;ince the kings &s;ons have been created earls of Che&s;ter, at the &s;ame time that they are created princes of Wales. Richard the Second made it a principality, annexing to it large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which had come to the crown by the attainder of the earl of Arundel; but hither he him&s;elf was afterwards brought pri&s;oner from Flint Ca&s;tle, where he had re&s;igned his crown, and then con|veyed to London. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or Henry IV. cau&s;ed the act by which it and the county were erected into a principality to be repealed; but they &s;till continued an earldom and a county palatine. King Henry VIII. made this city the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and both it and the county was at the &s;ame time impowered, by act of parliament, to elect members to repre&s;ent them in that a&s;&s;embly. In the civil wars the city took part with the king, and was be&s;ieged by the parliament's forces, and in 1695, a mint was e&s;tabli&s;hed in it for coining money.</P>
<P>As to its pre&s;ent &s;tate, it is a large, well built, wealthy city, and carries on a con&s;iderable trade. The hou&s;es are mo&s;tly of timber, with galleries, piazzas, and covered walls before them, by which not only the &s;hops, but tho&s;e who are walking about the town, are &s;o hid that one would ima|gine, there were &s;carce any inhabitants in it, though it is full of people. But though by this contrivance, &s;uch as walk the &s;treets, are &s;creened from rain, &amp;c. yet the &s;hops are there|by rendered dark and inconvenient. Notwith|&s;tanding this di&s;advantage, it is a very hand&s;ome city, for the &s;treets are generally &s;trait and large, and cro&s;s one another at right-angles. The ca&s;tle is &s;trong, and has a con&s;tant garri&s;on, and on the walls that &s;urround the city is a plea|&s;ant walk, commanding a pro&s;pect of Flint&s;hire and the mountains of Wales. Here is a noble
<PB N="382" REF="3950">
bridge of a dozen of arches over the Dee, which is the large&s;t river on the we&s;t &s;ide of Britain, except the Severn and Clyde; but as it ri&s;es in the mountains of Wales, is liable to &s;udden and danger|ous inundations, by which the town has &s;ometimes &s;uffered greatly. The cathedral is a very venerable pile, &s;aid to have been founded by Edgar the Saxon king, and to have been fini&s;hed and endowed by Hugh Lupus, nephew to the Conqueror. But though it continued for &s;ome time after that to be the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, yet it afterwards lo&s;t that dignity, and did not recover it till the reign of Henry VIII. when it had again a bi&s;hop of its own, and a dioce&s;e containing this county, to|gether with Lanca&s;hire, Richmond, &amp;c. It was now &s;ubjected to the archbi&s;hop of York, though at fir&s;t it had been in the province of Canter|bury. As the river here was &s;o choaked up with a &s;and-bank, that only &s;mall ve&s;&s;els could come up to the town, and the larger were forced to unload &s;ix miles below, a canal ten miles in length, in pur&s;uance of two acts of parliament, was cut at a va&s;t expence, through which large &s;hips now come up to the town. This city, by the great annual fairs held in it, and by its &s;ituation in the neighbourhood of the Severn, Wales, and Ireland, enjoys a very con&s;iderable trade. It is not a little benefited by the great re&s;ort of pa&s;&s;engers going to Ireland, or coming from it. Of the immen&s;e quantities of chee&s;e made in the county, and for which it is &s;o famous, much the greater part is &s;old here, and exported from hence to Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Bri&s;tol, and London, which, together with that which goes by land, is computed at about thirty thou|&s;and tons a year.</P>

held twice a year for criminal cau&s;es; but all civil cau&s;es relating to the county, are determined in the palatine courts, held by a chamberlain, a &s;pecial judge, or chief ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, two barons of the exchequer, three &s;erjeants at law, an attorney, e&s;cheator, &amp;c. In the ca&s;tle are al&s;o the office for the records, the prothonotary's office, and a pri&s;on for the county. The city is of a &s;quare form, about two miles in compa&s;s, and has four gates. There are a&s;&s;emblies in it every week. Its mo&s;t con&s;iderable manufacture is that of tobacco-pipes. The city is well &s;upplied with water from the river by means of mills. The fee-farm rents here belong to the princes of Wales, as earls of Che&s;ter. The inhabitants of the county at the change of every earl pay, or at lea&s;t u&s;ed formerly to pay, three thou&s;and marks, and tho&s;e of Flint, which was a part of the palatinate, two thou&s;and. The juri&s;diction of the chamberlain is the &s;ame in Che&s;hire, as that of the lord chancellor in the re&s;t of the king|dom. The officers belonging to the garri&s;on here are a governor of the city and ca&s;tle, a lieutenant governor, a ma&s;ter-gunner, &s;tore-keeper, and furbi&s;her of &s;mall arms, &amp;c. Here is a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, with a collector and other &s;ubordinate officers.</P>
<P>Malpas was antienly a ca&s;tle, which is now in ruins. The town &s;tands on a high hill near the Dee, and has a &s;tately church, in which are the monuments of the Cholmondeley family, a grammar-&s;chool, an ho&s;pital, and a good mar|ket. Its Latin name having been <HI>Mala platea,</HI> i. e. Ill &s;treet, the Normans called it Malpas, which &s;ignifies the &s;ame thing.</P>

<P>Torperley is a great thoroughfare on the Che&s;ter road, and the place where the &s;heriffs turns are u&s;ually kept.</P>
<P>Nantwich, or Namptwich, is a large well built flouri&s;hing town. Though it hath been twice de&s;troyed by fire, it hath &s;o well recovered it&s;elf, that not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of tho&s;e calamities appears. Its flouri&s;hing &s;tate is owing to its being a great thoroughfare to Ireland, to its weekly market for corn and cattle its fair, but chiefly to its &s;alt works, and extraordinary fine chee&s;e, which greatly exceeds that of the re&s;t of the county. The &s;alt &s;prings generally lie all along the river Weaver, and are from three to &s;even yards deep, and about thirty miles from the &s;ea. The water is &s;o cold at the bottom of the pits, that tho&s;e who clean&s;e them, cannot &s;tay above half an hour, nor even &s;o long without drinking &s;trong waters. The brine of the &s;everal pits is not equally rich in &s;alt. Of that in the town&s;hip of Nantwich, &s;ix pounds will make one pound of &s;alt. But it is ob&s;erved by the briners, that the &s;ame quantity of brine will make more &s;alt in a dry year, than in a wet &s;ea&s;on. For fuel they u&s;e Stafford&s;hire pit coal. In making the &s;alt, a certain quantity of cows, calves, or &s;heeps blood is mixed with the brine in the pan, and after it hath been boiled down to half the quantity, and &s;cummed, a certain quantity of whites of eggs is mixed with it, and after that a proportion of the &s;tronge&s;t ale. The brine is afterwards boiled gently till it gathers into corns, and a kind of &s;cum, like a thin ice comes on it. They never cover their pans at all during the whole time of boiling. The pans are in hou&s;es like barns, and the brine is conveyed
<PB N="385" REF="3980">
to them in wooden troughs or gutters. The fine&s;t &s;alt is that which is made up into loaves. Grey &s;alt is only u&s;ed by the poorer &s;ort of peo|ple to &s;alt their bacon, coar&s;e chee&s;e, &amp;c. Catts are lumps of the wor&s;t &s;ort of &s;alt mixed with a&s;hes and cummin &s;eeds, and baked in ovens for pigeon hou&s;es. The&s;e &s;alt-&s;prings are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been known to the Romans, and an im|po&s;t to have been laid by them upon the &s;alt.</P>
<P>Northwich &s;tands near the middle of the county, and &s;eems to be very antient. Here is not only a deep and plentiful brine-pit, with a great many mines of rock &s;alt, in which a number of men are continually at work with pickaxes, and dig it away in huge lumps, which are &s;ent to the &s;ea-ports, and there di&s;&s;olved, and purified for u&s;e. When one is let down a hundred and fifty feet into the mines, he is &s;trangely &s;truck with the appearance of them. They look &s;omething like a va&s;t cathedral of chry&s;tal, &s;upported by huge pillars, and glitter|ing all over with a variety of colours, from the light of the candles. There is a grammar-&s;chool in the town, and a fine church, with a &s;emi|circular choir.</P>
<P>Middlewich: here al&s;o are brine-pits, where a great deal of &s;alt is made. The brine of one pit is &s;o rich, that it yields a fourth part in &s;alt. This &s;alt is exceeding good, and the bacon and beef cured with it, e&s;pecially the hung beef, is ex|tremely palatable. The town con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal &s;treets and lanes, and has a &s;tately church, in which the Venables have a burying-place. It &s;tands near the junction of the Creke and Dan, and is a borough governed by burge&s;&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>DERBYSHIRE, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the ea&s;t by Not|tingham&s;hire, and a part of Leice&s;ter&s;hire, which la&s;t bounds it al&s;o on the &s;outh; on the we&s;t by Stafford&s;hire, and part of Che&s;hire; and on the north by York&s;hire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It is near forty miles in length from &s;outh to north, about thirty in breadth on the north-&s;ide, but on the &s;outh no more than &s;ix, and in cir|cumference about a hundred and thirty, contain|ing about &s;ix hundred and eighty thou&s;and acres, one hundred and &s;ix pari&s;hes, fifty-three vicarages, &s;ix hundreds, five hundred villages, eleven mar|ket towns, about twenty-one thou&s;and two hun|dred hou&s;es, and one hundred and twenty-&s;even thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, e&s;pecially on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, is plea&s;ant and healthful; but on the we&s;t &s;ide about the beak, it is &s;harper, and more &s;ubject to wind and rain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>In different parts of the county the &s;oil is very different. In the ea&s;t and &s;outh parts it is very fruitful in all kinds of grain, e&s;pecially barley, and is therefore well inhabited, e&s;pecially by malt&s;ters, who carry on a good trade both in malt and ale;
<PB N="389" REF="4020">
but in the we&s;t part beyond the Derwent, it is barren and mountainous, producing nothing but a little oats. However, as there is plenty of gra&s;s in the vales, and &s;ome on the hills, large flocks of &s;heep and other cattle are fed on them. This part of the county is called the Peak, from a Saxon word &s;ignifying an eminence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief mountains are tho&s;e of the Peak, very high, bleak, and barren, but profitable to the inhabitants, yielding great quantities of the be&s;t lead, antimony, mill-&s;tones, &s;cythe|&s;tones, and grind-&s;tones, marble, alaba&s;ter, a coar&s;e &s;ort of chry&s;tal, azure, &s;par, green, and white vitriol, allom, iron, and pit-coal. Such quantities of wood are con&s;umed at the lead and iron mines, and coal delfs, that very little is left.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS and LAKES.</HEAD>
<P>The chief rivers are the Dove and Derwent. The Dove is &s;o called from the colour of its waters, which bear a re&s;emblance to the bird of that name. It ri&s;es in the Peak, and divides this county from Stafford&s;hire, till it falls into the Trent five miles north of Burton. It pro|duces excellent trouts and graylings, and fer|tilizes the land &s;o much, when it overflows its banks, that its waters are thought to be impreg|nated with lime &s;tone. It will &s;ometimes &s;well &s;o much in twelve hours, as to carry away &s;heep and other cattle, and return as &s;uddenly to its old channel.</P>
<P>The Derwent ri&s;es al&s;o in the Peak, and takes its cour&s;e acro&s;s the county from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, till it falls into the Trent eight miles
<PB N="390" REF="4030">
below Derby. Its waters look black from the &s;oil through which it runs.</P>
<P>Upon a naked moor or plain, thirteen miles in length, north of Chat&s;worth, is a large pond, which covers near thirty acres, receiving as in a ci&s;tern all the waters that de&s;cend from the &s;ur|rounding hills, and by pipes &s;upplying all the ponds, canals, ca&s;cades, and water-works in the gardens of that palace.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES, NATURAL and ARTIFICIAL.</HEAD>
<P>Of the&s;e the chief are the wonders of the Peak, as they are called, which are commonly reckoned &s;even. The fir&s;t is the noble palace of the duke of Devon&s;hire, called Chat&s;worth. It was built by the fir&s;t duke of Devon, and can hardly be matched for beauty and magnificence: but the chapel and hall are particularly remarkable, being adorned with the fine&s;t paintings by Signior Verrio. In the chapel is a repre&s;entation of the re&s;urrection, and in the hall a picture of Cae&s;ar &s;tabbed in the &s;enate. The duke's clo&s;et, at the upper end of a noble range of chambers finely inlaid, is curiou&s;ly embelli&s;hed with Indian paint and figures of birds drawn by native Indians. The gardens are very noble, and admirably adorned with &s;tatues and water works. Among the &s;tatues and fi|gures are &s;everal Gladiators in very lively atti|tudes; Neptune with his nymphs, &s;porting as it were in the waters, which fall from a cock, in &s;everal columns, upon &s;ea-weeds; &s;ea-hor&s;es rolling in a pond; a willow of copper, every leaf of which upon the turning of a cock drops water as if it rained; two &s;ea nymphs at the top of a ca&s;cade, in a grove of cypre&s;s, with jars under their arms, from which water falls with a noi&s;e like that of a cataract; an artificial ro&s;e in a pond, through which, upon the turn of a cock,
<PB N="391" REF="4040">
the water a&s;cends, and exhibits the figure of that flower in the air; in another pond Mercury point|ing at the gods, and throwing up water. In &s;hort, they are adorned in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite man|ner imaginable, both by nature and art. Here Mary, queen of Scots, pa&s;&s;ed &s;eventeen years when a pri&s;oner in England, and there is an apartment that &s;till bears her name. Mar&s;hal Tallard too &s;pent a few days here, and was &s;o charmed with the place, and the politene&s;s of its owner, that he &s;aid at his departure, "that when he returned to France, and reckoned up the days of his captivity in England, he would leave out tho&s;e he pa&s;&s;ed at Chat&s;worth."</P>
<P>To render this place &s;till more romantic, there is an exceeding high mountain on the ea&s;t &s;ide covered with tall trees, ri&s;ing above one another to the top, on which they dig mill-&s;tones; and be|fore the we&s;t front runs the Derwent, which, when not &s;welled with rains, or the melting of the &s;now on the neighbouring mountains, glides peaceably along; but when rouzed, it makes a roaring noi&s;e like that of the &s;ea in &s;tormy weather breaking upon the rocks. There is a &s;tately bridge over the river, and in an i&s;land near it a building re&s;embling a ca&s;tle. In the front of the palace towards the gardens, and under the cornice of the frieze, is the family motto, <HI>Cavendo tutus,</HI> which, though con&s;i&s;ting of but twelve letters, extends the whole length of the front. The windows of the Attic &s;tory are &s;e|venteen feet high, of poli&s;hed looking-gla&s;s, and the wood-work double gilt. Beyond the gardens lies the park, taking in &s;ome hills, which are overlooked by other hills behind them. A &s;tranger coming from the north is equally charmed and amazed to behold &s;uch a delightful valley and noble palace, amid&s;t &s;uch wild rocks and moun|tains,
<PB N="392" REF="4050">
and after pa&s;&s;ing through a moor naked and dreary, and of great extent.</P>
<P>The &s;econd wonder is the mountain called Mam-tor, or Mother-tower. It &s;tands on the north &s;ide of the road from Buxton to Ca&s;tleton. There are &s;everal lead-mines at the bottom of it.</P>
<P>Elden-hole makes the third wonder or curio&s;ity of the Peak. It is a dreadful cha&s;m in the &s;ide of a mountain, of an unfathomable depth; &s;o that a line and plummet of near nine hundred yards, has been let down without reaching the bottom. In the reign of queen Elizabeth a poor man having been let down two hundred yards and drawn up again, was found to have lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and died &s;oon after of a phrenzy. The water, which is continually trickling from its top, is pre|&s;ently congealed into icicles; and when a &s;tone is thrown into it, it rebounds from &s;ide to &s;ide for a long time, making a noi&s;e like thunder, until the &s;ound is at length entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Buxton-Wells con&s;titute the fourth curio&s;ity. The country where they lie is healthy and plea|&s;ant: there are nine of them. They ri&s;e near the head of the river Wye, at the village of Buxton. The water is hot, &s;ulphureous, and &s;aline, yet very palatable when drank. They create a good appetite, and remove ob&s;tructions, but are not purgative. They are of a mode|rate heat, and being recommended both inter|nally and externally in rheumatic, &s;corbutic, and nervous complaints are much re&s;orted to in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. They are inclo&s;ed with a fair &s;tone building, erected by George, earl of Shrew&s;|bury. There are convenient lodgings in the vil|lage for per&s;ons of all ranks. The duke of De|von&s;hire, who is lord of the place, has built a large hou&s;e for the reception of &s;trangers; and the bath-room, being arched over, is very con|venient
<PB N="393" REF="4060">
and plea&s;ant. It will admit twenty people at a time to walk and &s;wim in it. The water is blood warm, and may be rai&s;ed to any height at plea&s;ure. It appears they were known to the Ro|mans; for they have been mentioned by &s;ome Roman authors, and &s;ome remains of a Roman cau&s;eway and wall are &s;till vi&s;ible. It is worth ob|&s;erving, that there is a cold &s;pring within five feet of one of the hot wells.</P>
<P>Weeding-Well, or Tides, make the fifth won|der. It is a &s;pring near the town of Tidde&s;wall, that ebbs and flows irregularly; which phaenome|non is &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to the different pre&s;|&s;ure of the air upon the &s;ubterraneous waters.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth wonder is Pool's-Hole, a cave at the foot of a high hill, called Coitmo&s;s, &s;o nar|row at the entrance, that one is obliged to creep on all fours; but it &s;oon opens to a con&s;ider|able height, extending to above a quarter of a mile, with a roof &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of an ancient cathedral. By the petrifying water continually dropping in &s;everal parts of the cave, are formed a variety of curious figures and repre|&s;entations of the works both of nature and art. There is a column here clear as alaba&s;ter, which is called the queen of Scots pillar; becau&s;e &s;he is &s;aid to have proceeded &s;o far, when &s;he vi&s;ited this place. If a pi&s;tol is fired by this pillar, it will make a report as loud as that of a cannon Near the extremity there is a hollow in the roof, called the Needle's-Eye, in which if a candle is placed, it will repre&s;ent a &s;tar in the firmament. At a little di&s;tance from this cave is a &s;mall clear &s;tream made up of hot and cold water, &s;o near each other, that the finger and thumb of the &s;ame hand may be put, the one into the hot, and the other into the cold.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="4070">
The &s;eventh wonder is what they call the Devil's A&mdash;&s;e, or Peak's A&mdash;&s;e, which is a huge cavern at the bottom of a hill near Ca&s;tleton, with &s;eve|ral &s;treams of water in it. In &s;everal places the vault makes a fine appearance, being chequered with &s;tones of various colours. There are poor people that have huts in a vault hard by, who are always ready to bring candles to &s;hew &s;trangers the place.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other things about the Peak worth mentioning be&s;ides the&s;e.</P>
<P>Near a village called Byrchover, there are two tottering &s;tones upon a rock, of which one is very large; and yet is &s;o equally poi&s;ed upon the point on which it re&s;ts, that it may be moved with a finger.</P>
<P>In &s;inking a lead groove near Bradwall, a mon|&s;trous tooth was found, which though not en|tire, mea&s;ured thirteen inches and a half in com|pa&s;s, and weighed near four pounds; and a &s;kull, that held &s;even pecks of corn. Some think the&s;e bones belonged to human bodies, others to tho&s;e of brute animals; while a third &s;et, among whom is Dr. Leigh, think they are only the &s;portings of nature, like tho&s;e found in Pool's-hole, and the mines of this country.</P>
<P>At the bottom of &s;everal mountains are open|ings, called by the country people &s;wallows; be|cau&s;e, though &s;everal &s;treams enter into them, no vent appears; but both the&s;e, and tho&s;e in the Devil's A&mdash;&s;e, are &s;uppo&s;ed to form the water that i&s;&s;ue from the mountains near Ca&s;tleton.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e of Buxton, there are medicinal waters at &s;everal other places in the county, as at Stanley and Quarendon, near Derby, which are chalybeate; at Kedla&s;ton, which are &s;aid to be good for the lepro&s;y, and old ulcers; at Matlock, a village upon the Derwent, which are milk-warm,
<PB N="395" REF="4080">
and very plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome to bathe in; but the road to it is very bad and dangerous, and the accommodation but indifferent. As there is plenty of &s;tones hereabouts, the fields are all en|clo&s;ed, not with trees and hedges, but &s;tone-walls. Here are &s;melting-mills for the lead-ore, which, by the help of moulds, is fa&s;hioned into pigs. Over again&s;t Matlock there is a dreadful pile of rocks, called the Torr.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The county town is Derby, which gives name to the &s;hire. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o called from having been a park or &s;helter for deer; and what makes this &s;uppo&s;ition probable, is, that the arms of the town con&s;i&s;t of a buck couchant in a park. It is a neat town, full of people, and &s;ends two members to parliament. It is watered by two rivers, or rather a river and a brook; and yet the latter hath nine bridges over it, and the former only one. It is ancient, having been a royal borough in the time of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. It appears to have had a ca&s;tle formerly, but of that no ve&s;|tiges now remain. In digging for foundations human bones of a mon&s;trous &s;ize have been found. It is divided into five pari&s;hes, each having its church, of which the mo&s;t remarkable is that of All-Saints, built about the reign of queen Mary. One half of the expence was de|frayed by the batchelors and maidens of the town. There are &s;everal noble monuments in it, e&s;pe|cially of the Cavendi&s;h family, of which the mo&s;t remarkable is that for the counte&s;s, who built the fir&s;t palace at Chat&s;worth, and founded an ho&s;pital here for four poor men, and as many women. One Richard Cra&s;haw, who was a poor nailer's &s;on, and died in 1631, has a monument here. He
<PB N="396" REF="4090">
went from hence in a leathern doublet to Lon|don, where he became rich, and left four thou&s;and pounds to charities.</P>
<P>The trade of the place con&s;i&s;ts in wool, buying and &s;elling corn, making malt, and ale, of which con&s;iderable quantities are &s;ent to London. By a charter from Charles I. the government of the town is ve&s;ted in a mayor, high-&s;teward, nine al|dermen, a recorder, town-clerk, fourteen bre|thren, and fourteen common-council men; and here the a&s;&s;izes and &s;e&s;&s;ions are u&s;ually kept. It hath given title of earl to many noble families, but at pre&s;ent to that of Stanley. Among the privileges granted to the citizens by different kings, is that of paying no toll except in Win|che&s;ter, and &s;ome few other places; of having a coroner; of not being liable to be impleaded out of their borough; of having a power to exclude all Jews from &s;elling in the town. There were anciently three mona&s;teries in it, be&s;ides &s;everal in the neighbourhood. The fee-farm rent of the town and manor, which before belonged to the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter, was granted by Henry VIII. to the dean and chapter of Burton on Trent. It has three weekly markets, Wedne&s;day, Friday, and Saturday, be&s;ides &s;everal fairs.</P>
<P>Here is that curious machine for thrown &s;ilk, the model of which Sir Thomas Lombe, at the hazard of his life, brought from Italy. Before that period, the Engli&s;h merchants u&s;ed to purcha&s;e thrown &s;ilks of the Italians for ready money. By the help of this wonderful ma|chine, one hand-mill will twi&s;t as much &s;ilk, as fifty people could do without it. It works &s;eventy-three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty &s;ix yards of &s;ilk thread every time the water wheel goes round, which is thrice in a minute. The hou&s;e, in which it is contained, is five or &s;ix
<PB N="397" REF="4100">
&s;tories high, and half a quarter of a mile in length. When Sir Thomas's patent expired in 1732, the parliament was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the value and importance of it, that they granted him a further recompence of fourteen thou&s;and pounds, for the hazard and expence he had incurred in intro|ducing and erecting it, upon condition he &s;hould allow an exact model of it to be taken; which model is depo&s;ited in the Tower of London, in order to prevent an art &s;o curious and import|ant from being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable town is Work&s;worth, the greate&s;t market for lead in England, the furnaces for &s;melting it being here, and at Creich, a vil|lage on the other &s;ide the Derwent. The Miners, or Peak rills, as they are called, are a rude boori&s;h &s;ort of people, but very bold and dexterous in working under ground; &s;o that they are often employed in &s;apping at &s;ieges. Controver&s;ies among them are determined by a court, called Barmoot. The produce of the mines in this hun|dred is very con&s;iderable. The king claims the thirteenth penny; but in lieu thereof, they give a thou&s;and pounds a year. It has a hand&s;ome church, a free-&s;ch&oacute;ol, and alms-hou&s;e. The tythe of Work&s;worth yields &s;ometimes a thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Its market is on Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>A&s;kborn &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Dove, in a rich &s;oil; but has little trade, except in chee&s;e.</P>
<P>Che&s;terfield is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable town in Scar&s;dale, a fruitful valley, &s;o called from being &s;urrounded with rugged rocks, which in the Saxon are &s;tyled Scarrs. It is a hand&s;ome populous town, governed by a mayor and aldermen, and gives the title of earl to a branch of the noble fa|mily of Stanhope. It was made a free borough by king John, and near it the barons were de|feated by Henry III. It had formerly a mona&s;tery,
<PB N="398" REF="4110">
and has now a hand&s;ome church, a free-&s;chool, and carries on a great trade in lead, leather, &s;tock|ings, bedding, blankets, &amp;c. with all the neigh|bouring counties, and with London, Liverpool, Manche&s;ter, and other towns.</P>
<P>Bakewell is a good town &s;tanding on the north|we&s;t &s;ide of the Peak, near where the Wye falls into the Derwent. It makes but one pari&s;h, but has &s;even chapels; and being a peculiar, is ex|empt from epi&s;copal juri&s;diction. From &s;ome altars of rough &s;tone found in the neighbour|hood, it appears to have been a Roman &s;tation. Its market is on Monday.</P>
<P>Alfreton, a contraction, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, of Al|fred's town, &s;tands al&s;o on Scar&s;dale. The only thing it is noted for is its ale, which is &s;trong, and has a fine flavour.</P>
<P>At no great di&s;tance from Alfreton &s;tands Bal|&s;over, a large town and ca&s;tle, upon a ri&s;ing ground. Its only manufacture is fine tobacco-pipes.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal towns in Derby&s;hire. The whole county &s;ends but four members to parliament, two for Derby, and two for the &s;hire; and is in the dioce&s;e of Litchfield and Coventry.</P>

<HEAD>NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the ea&s;t by Lin|coln&s;hire, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh by Leice&s;|ter&s;hire, on the we&s;t by Derby&s;hire, and on the north and north-we&s;t by York&s;hire. It extends in length forty-three miles, twenty-four in breadth, and one hundred and ten miles in compa&s;s; contain|ing five hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and acres, eight hundreds, nine market-towns, one hundred and &s;ixty-eight pari&s;hes, four hundred and fifty vil|lages, about &s;eventeen thou&s;and five hundred and ninety-four hou&s;es, and ninety five thou&s;and inha|bitants. No county in England enjoys a plea|&s;anter and healthier air. As for the &s;oil it differs widely in different parts of the county. Towards the we&s;t, where lies the fore&s;t of Sherwood, it is &s;andy, and therefore that part of the county is called by the inhabitants, the Sand; but the &s;outh and ea&s;t parts, watered by the Trent and the rivulets that fall into it, are clayey, and for that rea&s;on are called by the inhabitants, the Clay. The latter is fruitful both in corn and pa&s;ture; but the former produces little be|&s;ides wood, coal, and &s;ome lead. The county has a variety of commodities and manufac|tures, as wool, leather, tallow, butter, chee&s;e,
<PB N="401" REF="4140">
coal, marle, cattle, malt, liquorice, &s;tockings, gla&s;s, earthen-wares, and &s;trong ale. The prin|cipal rivers are the Trent and Idle. The Trent, who&s;e name is &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived either from the French or Latin word &s;ignifying thirty, either becau&s;e it receives thirty &s;maller rivers, or has thirty different &s;orts of fi&s;h in it, is inferior to no rivers in England, but the Severn, Thames, and Humber. It enters the county on the &s;outh-we&s;t, and pa&s;&s;es through it to the north-ea&s;t, where it enters Lincoln&s;hire, and after a long cour&s;e falls at la&s;t into the Humber. The Idle ri&s;es in Sher|wood-fore&s;t, and after traver&s;ing the northern part of the county, falls into the Trent upon the bor|ders of York&s;hire and Lincoln&s;hire.</P>
<P>The &s;pacious fore&s;t of Sherwood lies in the we&s;t part of the county, and indeed takes up the greate&s;t part of it. It was formerly &s;o thick, that it was hardly pa&s;&s;able; but now it is much thinner. It feeds an infinite number of deer and &s;tags; and has &s;ome towns in it, of which Mansfield is the chief. It abounds in coal, and a road lies through it for thirty miles together. Since the reign of king Edward I. the nobility and gentry have had grants of it. It is governed by a great number of officers under the earl of Che&s;terfield, chief fore&s;ter, who&s;e ance&s;tor, Sir John Stanhope, had a grant of it, with liberty to de&s;troy and kill at plea&s;ure, re&s;erving only an hundred deer in the whole walk.</P>
<P>The principal towns of the county are the&s;e:</P>
<P>Nottingham, which gives name to the county, is a hand&s;ome town, and a county of it&s;elf by charter. The name is derived from the Saxon word <HI>Snottengham,</HI> which &s;ignifies caves, from the caves and apartments anciently dug in the rocks on which the town &s;tands. The&s;e, being &s;oft, ea&s;ily yield to the &s;pade and pick-axe, whence the
<PB N="402" REF="4150">
town&s;men have excellent cellars for the va&s;t quan|tities of malt liquors made here, and &s;ent, as well as their malt, to mo&s;t parts of England. The &s;i|tuation of the town is very plea&s;ant, having mea|dows on one hand, and hills of a gentle, ea&s;y a&s;cent, on the other. It is well &s;upplied with fuel, both wood and coal, from the fore&s;t, and with fi&s;h by the Trent, which runs about a mile to the &s;outh of it, and has been made navigable for barges: &s;o that they receive by it not only great quantities of chee&s;e from Warwick&s;hire and Stafford&s;hire; but all their heavy goods from the Humber, and even from Hull. It is of great antiquity, and had an|ciently a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, where is now a fine &s;eat belonging to the duke of Newca&s;tle. It is noted for its hor&s;e-races on a fine cour&s;e on the north &s;ide of the town. The corporation is go|verned by a mayor, recorder, &s;ix aldermen, two coroners, two &s;heriffs, two chamberlains, and twenty-four common-council men, eighteen of the &s;enior council, and &s;ix of the junior, a bell|bearer, and two pindars, one for the fields, and the other for the meadows. The town being within the juri&s;diction of the fore&s;t, the former of the&s;e pindars is town-woodward, and attends the fore&s;t courts. It has three neat churches, the chief of which is St. Mary's, and an alms-hou&s;e endowed with one hundred pounds a year for twelve poor people; with a noble town-hou&s;e, &s;ur|rounded with piazzas. A con&s;iderable trade is carried on in gla&s;s and earthen-wares, and frame|&s;tockings, be&s;ides the malt, and malt-liquors, mentioned above. Mar&s;hal Tallard, when a pri|&s;oner in England, was confined to this town and county. In the duke of Newca&s;tle's park there is a ledge of rocks hewn into a church, hou&s;es, chambers, dove-hou&s;es, &amp;c. The altar of the
<PB N="403" REF="4160">
church is natural rock, and between that and the ca&s;tle there is an hermitage of the like workman|&s;hip. Upon the &s;ide of a hill there is a very ex|traordinary &s;ort of a hou&s;e, where you enter at the garret, and a&s;cend to the cellar, which is at the top of the hou&s;e. Here is a noted ho&s;pital founded by John Plumtree, e&s;quire, in the reign of Richard II. for thirteen poor old widows; and four hand&s;ome bridges over the Trent and Lind. To keep the&s;e in repair, and other u&s;es, the cor|poration has good e&s;tates. This town and Win|chel&s;ea both give title of earl to the noble fa|mily of Finch. Here David, king of Scots, when a pri&s;oner in England, re&s;ided, and under|ground is a vault, called Mortimer's hole, becau&s;e Roger Mortimer, earl of March, is &s;aid to have ab&s;conded in it, when he was taken and hanged by order of Edward III. If any would know the ancient religious foundation here, let him con&s;ult Dr. Thoroton. It has a market on Wedne&s;day, Friday, and Saturday, be&s;ides &s;everal fairs.</P>
<P>Another neat well-built town is Newark upon Trent, &s;o called from a ca&s;tle built here by the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, in the reign of king Stephen. It is a great thoroughfare on the north road, and &s;tands on an i&s;land formed by the Trent, over which there are hand&s;ome bridges. Here king John died on his way to Lincoln; and the ca&s;tle made an ob&s;tinate defence, fir&s;t for king John, and afterwards for king Charles I. but was demo|li&s;hed, after it had been &s;urrendered to the Scots by the king's command, when he put him&s;elf into their hands. Some antiquities have been found about it, particularly four urns, and a hou&s;hold god of bra&s;s. The church has a lofty &s;pire, and is reckoned one of the fine&s;t in England; and the market-place is &s;o &s;pacious, that ten thou&s;and
<PB N="404" REF="4170">
men were drawn up in it by lord Bella&s;is, when he defended the town again&s;t the Scots in the civil wars. It is a corporation governed by a mayor and twelve aldermen, &s;ends two members to parlia|ment, gives the title of vi&s;count to the duke of King&s;ton, and carries on a good trade in corn, cattle, and wool.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t Redford is an ancient borough &s;urround|ed with plantations of hops. It is a corporation governed by two bailiffs, a &s;teward, who are to be ju&s;tices of the peace, and of the quorum within the borough, twelve aldermen, two chamberlains, a town-clerk, and two &s;erjeants at mace; and it enjoys many privileges granted by &s;everal kings, with power to alter their common &s;eal at plea&s;ure. It has a hand&s;ome church, vi&s;ited every year by the archbi&s;hop of York, or the archdeacon of Nottingham, a free grammar-&s;chool, the be&s;t &s;hambles in the county, and carries on a pretty good trade in hops, malt, and barley.</P>
<P>We&s;t Redford, &s;o called becau&s;e it &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Idle, oppo&s;ite to the other, to which it is joined by a bridge, has nothing re|markable in it, be&s;ides Trinity-ho&s;pital, founded in the year 1666, by John Dorrel. It is governed by a ma&s;ter, who is always to be the &s;ubdean of Lincoln, and ten brethren, who can let lea&s;es for twenty-one years. The ma&s;ter has fifteen pounds a year, and each of the brethren ten pounds, be|&s;ides ten pounds for a load of coals every year, and &s;ix yards of cloth for a gown every other year. There is al&s;o an allowance of ten pounds for the maintenance of a &s;cholar in Exeter college in Ox|ford, where the founder was a &s;tudent, and others for under officers; in particular, for one of the brethren to read prayers.</P>
<P>Mansfield is a large town in Sherwood fore&s;t.
<PB N="405" REF="4180">
Its market is well &s;upplied with corn and cattle, and it drives a con&s;iderable trade in malt. Our kings u&s;ed formerly to vi&s;it this place often, on account of hunting, which might give ri&s;e to the &s;ong and &s;tory of the Miller of Mansfield; and it appears from an old inqui&s;ition, that the manor of Cukeney in this county was held by &s;erjeanty for &s;hoeing the king's hor&s;es when he came to Mansfield. Several odd cu&s;toms are mentioned in an old parchment of the manor of Mansfield|fore&s;t; as fir&s;t, That the tenants be all free of blood, and may marry them&s;elves according to their wills, whether men or women. Secondly, That the heirs be of full age as &s;oon as they are born. Third|ly, That lands be divi&s;ible among &s;ons, and if there be no &s;ons among daughters; and the like. An e&s;tate, called Wolf-hunt-land, was formerly held here by the &s;ervice of winding an horn, and frightening away the wolves in the fore&s;t of Sher|wood. The town either took its name from, or gave it to Mansfield in Germany, the fir&s;t count of which it is &s;aid was born here. It gives the title of baron to the right honourable William Murray, lord chief-ju&s;tice of England.</P>
<P>Tuxford, &s;ituated between Newark and Baw|tree, in that part of the county called the South-Clay, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another called the North-Clay. It has a free-&s;chool, built by Charles Read, e&s;quire, and endowed with fifty pou ds a year for a ma&s;ter and u&s;her, twenty pounds for boarding and teaching four mini&s;ters &s;ons, or tho&s;e of decayed gentlemen, and twenty pounds for teaching the town boys. The mayor and al|dermen of Newark and &s;ix neighbouring gentle|men, are the tru&s;tees for it.</P>
<P>Work&s;op, a &s;mall town noted for plenty of li|quorice and malt. The ruins of a mona&s;tery

founded here in the reign of Henry I. are &s;till to be &s;een at the ea&s;t end of the town.</P>
<P>Southwell. Here is a very ancient collegiate church, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been founded, anno 636, by Paulinus, archbi&s;hop of York. It was &s;ur|rendered at the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries to Henry VIII. but, as appears by an in&s;cription in the church, refounded at the in&s;tance of the arch|bi&s;hop of York. The chapter has a peculiar ju|ri&s;diction over twenty-eight pari&s;hes, to mo&s;t of which it has the right of pre&s;entation, be&s;ides others in Lincoln&s;hire and York&s;hire. It has al&s;o a civil juri&s;diction, to which about twenty towns are &s;ubject, for which the cu&s;tos rotu|lorum and ju&s;tices are nominated by the arch|bi&s;hop of York. The church is a plain Gothic building without any painted gla&s;s or other orna|ment, and is reputed the mother-church of the town and county of Nottingham. The arch|bi&s;hops of York had formerly a large palace here, with three parks adjoining well &s;tored with deer; but it hath been long in ruins, and the e&s;tate de|mi&s;ed in lea&s;e. They are, however, &s;till lords of the manor, and enjoy great privileges here. Ad|joining to the church is a free-&s;chool, where the choiri&s;ters and town boys are taught gratis. The ma&s;ter is cho&s;e by the chapter, but mu&s;t be ap|proved by the archbi&s;hop of York. There are two fellow&s;hips and two &s;cholar&s;hips in St. John's college in Cambridge, to be pre&s;ented, by the will of the founder, to &s;uch as have been choiri&s;ters of the church at Southwell. From this town the family of the Southwells took their name, and were anciently &s;eated here. On the &s;outh &s;ide of this county &s;tands Go|tham, that is Goats-home, from the goats, it is likely, that were anciently kept there, a place noted for the pretended &s;tupidity of its inhabi|tants;

<HEAD>SOIL and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>It is a champaign country in general, and abun|dantly fertile in corn and gra&s;s, being watered by &s;everal rivers, as the Soure, or Sare, which pa&s;&s;es through the middle of it, and abounds in excel|lent &s;almon and other fi&s;h, the Wreke, Trent, Eye, Sen&s;e, Auker, and Aven. The&s;e rivers be|ing mo&s;tly navigable, greatly facilitate the trade of the county. In &s;ome parts there is a great &s;carcity of fuel, both wood and coal; but in the more hilly parts there is plenty of both, together with great flocks of &s;heep. Be&s;ides wheat, bar|ley, oats, and pea&s;e, it produces the be&s;t beans in England. They grow &s;o tall and luxuriant in &s;ome places, particularly about Barton in the Beans, that they look towards the harve&s;t time like a fore&s;t; and the inhabitants eat them not only when they are green, as in other places, but all the year round, for which rea&s;on their neigh|bours nickname them bean-bellies, and will tell you, that if you &s;hake a Leice&s;ter&s;hire man by the collar, the beans will rattle in his belly. They have plenty of very good wool, of which they
<PB N="410" REF="4230">
not only make great quantities of &s;tockings, but &s;end a great quantity unmanufactured into other parts of England. They make great profit of their corn and pul&s;e, and likewi&s;e breed great num|bers of coach and dray hor&s;es, mo&s;t of the gen|tlemen being gra&s;iers; and it is not uncommon to rent gra&s;s farms from five hundred to two thou|&s;and pounds a year. It is in the midland circuit and dioce&s;e of Lincoln, and &s;ends four members to parliament, two for Leice&s;ter, and two for the county.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The principal is Leice&s;ter, that is a city upon the Leire, now called Soare. From its &s;ituation on the Fo&s;&s;e-way, and the many coins and anti|quities di&s;covered here, it &s;eems probable, that it was a place of &s;ome note in the time of the Romans. In the time of the Saxons, it was a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and afterwards &s;o repaired and for|tified by Edelfleda, that it became, according to Matthew Paris, a mo&s;t wealthy place, having thirty-two pari&s;h churches: but in Henry the Second's reign it was in a manner quite ruined, for joining in rebellion again&s;t him with Robert earl of Leice&s;ter. In the reign of Edward III. however, it began to recover, by the favour of his &s;on Henry Plantagenet, duke and earl of Lan|ca&s;ter, who founded and endowed a collegiate church and ho&s;pital here. It is a borough and corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder, &s;teward, bailiff, twenty-four aldermen, forty-eight common-council men, a &s;olicitor, a town-clerk, and two chamberlains. It had its fir&s;t charter from king John. The freemen are exempt from paying toll in all the fairs and markets of England. It has three ho&s;pitals, that mentioned above built by Henry Plantagenet, duke of Lanca&s;ter, and
<PB N="411" REF="4240">
capable of &s;upporting an hundred aged people decently; another erected and endowed in the reign of Henry VIII. for twelve poor lazars, and another for &s;ix widows. The ca&s;tle was a prodigious large building, where the duke of Lanca&s;ter kept his court. The hall and kitchen &s;till remain entire, of which the former is very &s;pacious and lofty, and in the tower over one of the gateways is kept the magazine for the county militia. There was a famous mona&s;|tery here antiently called, from its &s;ituation in the meadows, St. Mary de Pratis or Prez. In the&s;e meadows is now the cour&s;e for the hor&s;e race. It is &s;aid that Richard III. who was killed at the battle of Bo&s;worth, lies interred in St. Margaret's church. We cannot omit here a me|morable epitaph in St. Martin's church, import|ing that one Heyric, who died in 1489, aged &s;eventy-&s;ix, lived in one hou&s;e with Mary his wife fifty-two years; and in all that time never buried man, woman, or child, though &s;ome|times twenty in family. Mary, at her death, in December 1711, could number a hundred and forty-three per&s;ons de&s;cended from her. The chief bu&s;ine&s;s of Leice&s;ter is the &s;tocking trade, which hath produced, in general, to the amount of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds a year. In a parlia|ment held here in the reign of Henry V. the fir&s;t law for the burning of heretics was made, levelled again&s;t the followers of Wickliff, who was rector of Lutterworth in this county, and where his pulpit is &s;aid &s;till to remain. The town &s;uffered greatly in the civil wars, by two &s;ieges upon the back of one another. It has given the title of earl to &s;everal noble families, and la&s;t to Thomas Coke, lord Lovel, created earl of Leice&s;ter in 1744. It has a market every Sa|turday.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="4250">
Bo&s;worth is famous for the battle fought in a place called Red-more Plain, three miles from the town, which put an end to the conte&s;t between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter. Pieces of armour of different kinds are frequently found there; and there is an artifical mount from which Henry VII. is &s;aid to have made a &s;peech to his army before the battle. To di&s;tingui&s;h it from another Bo&s;worth in the county, it is called Market-Bo&s;|worth.</P>
<P>Harborough &s;tands on the river Welland, on the high road from London to Derby. The town has no lands belonging to it; whence came the proverb that a goo&s;e will eat up all the gra&s;s growing in Harborough; and it is u&s;ual to threaten to throw children into Harborough field. It gives the title of earl to Philip lord Sherrard.</P>
<P>A&s;hby de la Zouch, &s;o called from the Zouches, who were formerly lords of it, &s;tands plea&s;antly between two parks on the &s;kirts of Derby|&s;hire. Its fairs are noted for hor&s;es of a large breed. The town had once a ca&s;tle, now de|moli&s;hed. In the civil wars it had a garri&s;on for the king, called the maiden garri&s;on, becau&s;e it was never attacked by the parliament's forces. In the church, which is large and hand&s;ome, the Ha&s;tings, earls of Huntington, have &s;everal fine monuments, and in their gift is the free-&s;chool, which has a liberal &s;tipend, be&s;ides other cha|ritable funds. The place is noted for its good ale, and for the politene&s;s of its inhabitants. James I. and his court pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days with the then earl, in his ca&s;tle here, when dinner was &s;erved up every day by thirty poor knights, with gold chains and velvet gowns.</P>
<P>Lutterworth: here the famous Wickliff, who paved the way for the reformation, was rector. The pulpit, out of re&s;pect to the memory of that

<P>Melton Mowbray, &s;o called from its antient lords of the name of Mowbray, is a hand&s;ome town, and has a market, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable for cattle of any in that part of England. Here are two fine bridges over the Eye, by which the town is almo&s;t &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>Burton-Lazers: in this town was the chief ho&s;|pital for lepers in England, to which all the re&s;t were &s;ubject, as it was to that at Jeru&s;alem.

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The chief antiquity is the Roman military highway, called Watling Street, which &s;hews it|&s;elf here very plainly, and runs northward, almo&s;t in a direct line, along the we&s;t &s;ide of the county. It is &s;aid to have begun at Dover, and to have pa&s;&s;ed through the mid&s;t of Kent by London; thence by St. Albans, Dun&s;table, Stratford, Tou|ce&s;ter, Littleborne, St. Gilbert's Hill, near Shrew&s;|bury; thence by Stratton, and &s;o through the
<PB N="414" REF="4270">
middle of Wales to Cardigan. Near Lutterworth is a water &s;o cold, that in a little time it converts &s;traws and &s;ticks into &s;tone. The Bennones in the Itinerary of Antoninus are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been about Cleybrook, both becau&s;e the two prin|cipal antient ways cro&s;&s;ed there, and becau&s;e antient coins and foundations of buildings have been di&s;covered on this &s;pot. The name of Bens|ford-bridge, not far off, is al&s;o thought to be derived from thence. Lindley lord&s;hip is remarkable for this, that therein was never &s;een adder, &s;nake, or lizard; though in all the neighbouring places they have been commonly found. At Higham a great deal of &s;ilver coin of Henry the Third, &s;ome gold rings, &s;ome links of gold chains, and &s;ome &s;ilver coins of Trajan, have been found. Many antiquities have been di&s;covered at Leice&s;ter; as fir&s;t, an antient temple &s;uppo&s;ed to be dedicated to Janus, near which, in a place called Holy Bones, great &s;tore of bones have been dug up, which are thought to have been the bones of the victims. 2. A cellar near the elm trees, not far from All Saints church, with &s;everal curious figures on it in a &s;ort of Mo&s;aic. 3. Great medals and coins, both in &s;ilver and copper, of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Domitian, Trajan, Antoninus, and others. 4. An apartment under ground, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been u&s;ed as a hot-bath. At Segs-hill or Sex-hill, a &s;mall round hill, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a Roman tumulus. Seven miles from Leice&s;ter &s;ix pari&s;hes meet, and &s;et the marks of their pari&s;h bounds. At Ratcliff is an uncommon tumulus, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;epulchral monument of &s;ome Dani&s;h king. Barrow-hill and Erdburrow, thought to be the antient Vernomitum.</P>

<P>The air is healthy and plea&s;ant, and the &s;oil very fruitful both in corn and pa&s;ture; for though

there is but one &s;tream, that may be called a river, viz. the Gua&s;h or Wa&s;h, which runs acro&s;s it from ea&s;t to we&s;t, yet there are many brooks that &s;upply the county both with fi&s;h and water, be|&s;ides the Welland, which bounds it to the &s;outh. The &s;oil, being of a reddi&s;h colour, is &s;uppo&s;ed to give name to the county. It produces plenty of wood, and feeds large herds of cattle and flocks of &s;heep.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable town of the county is Okeham, in the middle of that delicious vale called Catmo&s;e, probably from <HI>coet maes,</HI> which in the Briti&s;h &s;ignifies, a woody field or ground. The town, no doubt, took its name from the oaks that grew there. Near the church are &s;till to be &s;een the ruins of a ca&s;tle, upon the gate of which are nailed a great many hor&s;e&s;hoes; for every baron of the realm, the fir&s;t time he comes through the town, is obliged to give a hor&s;e-&s;hoe to be nailed upon the ca&s;tle gate, and if he re|fu&s;es, the bailiff of the manor may &s;top his hor&s;es, and take one from them. But it is commonly redeemed with a little money, and in proportion to the gift, a &s;hoe is made larger or &s;maller with the donor's name and titles on it, and nailed to the gate. Here is a free-&s;chool built and endowed in the reign of Charles II. by Mr. Robert John|&s;on, par&s;on of North-Luffenham, in this county, and a ho&s;pital for the maintenance of two chap|lains, and twelve poor men, in the reign of Richard II. by Mr. William Dalby, of Exton, which is &s;till in being. Here in 1619 was born a dwarf, who when a year old was &s;carce eighteen inches. Being then in the duke of Bucking|ham's family, on a progre&s;s the court made into tho&s;e parts, he was &s;erved up in a cold pye, and
<PB N="417" REF="4300">
thence called the pygmy of the pa&s;ty. After|wards he grew up to three feet nine inches, and in the civil wars was a captain of hor&s;e; but going with the queen to France, and killing in a duel on hor&s;eback the brother of lord Crofts, he was expelled the court. Upon this he went to &s;ea, and was taken by a Turki&s;h pyrate: after many years &s;lavery, being redeemed, he re|turned to England, and lived &s;everal years upon pen&s;ions from the duke of Buckingham and other noblemen, till in 1678, he was taken up for the popi&s;h plot, and confined in the Gatehou&s;e; but was at la&s;t di&s;charged, and died in 1682. The earl of Winchel&s;ea is patron of the church, and lord of the ca&s;tle and manor. Here is a market every Saturday, and its fairs are in April and September.</P>
<P>Uppingham is &s;o called from its &s;ituation on a ri&s;ing ground. It is a hand&s;ome town, and has a good market for corn and cattle, together with a free-&s;chool and ho&s;pital, founded by the par&s;on of North Luffenham. The bi&s;hop of London is patron of the church, which is a rectory; and the &s;tandard of weights and mea&s;ures for the county, by &s;tatute of Henry VII. is kept here.</P>
<P>Lydington: here, about 1602, Thomas lord Burleigh founded an ho&s;pital or alms-hou&s;e for a warden, twelve poor men, and two poor women; and a little after a &s;mall one was founded at Morcot in the &s;ame hundred.</P>

<P>There are a great many fine &s;eats in this &s;mall county, the chief of which are the earl of Gain&s;|borough's at Exton; and the earl of Winchel|&s;ea's at Burley on the Hill, near Okeham. The &s;ituation of the latter is admirable, commanding an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over the Vale of Catmo&s;e. It belonged formerly to lord Harrington, and afterwards to Villiers, duke of Buckingham, who made a fine &s;eat of it; but that was burnt down in the civil wars. The pre&s;ent hou&s;e, which is a very noble edifice, was built by the late earl of Nottingham. It is adorned with a fine park, five or &s;ix miles in circumference, full of woods, game and deer, with delicious gardens, exqui&s;ite paintings, a &s;plendid library, &amp;c. &s;o that there are few &s;eats in England &s;uperior to it.</P>

<HEAD>RIVERS and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>There are many large rivers in the county, as the Nen, Welland, Gna&s;h, Witham, Bane, Trent, Dun, and Ankam, all abounding with fi&s;h. In the Fens are very rich pa&s;tures, &s;o that their cat|tle are the large&s;t in England, unle&s;s, perhaps, we &s;hould except tho&s;e of Somer&s;et&s;hire; and at certain &s;ea&s;ons the numbers of fowl are amaz|ing,

e&s;pecially of ducks; &s;o that Cambden &s;ays, they could, in his time, about Crowl catch a thou|&s;and at once in Augu&s;t with a &s;ingle net; and they called the pools, where they catched them, their corn fields, no corn then growing within five miles of the place. That of the&s;e fowls there were &s;ome &s;orts not only very rare, but extremely delicate, as the puittes, knotts, and goodwitts; &s;o that the nice&s;t palates and riche&s;t pur&s;es greatly coveted them. The knotts are &s;aid to be &s;o called, from their having been fir&s;t brought from Denmark, for the u&s;e of king Canute. The dotterel is &s;o called becau&s;e it is a very &s;imple bird, and mimicks all the motions of the fowler, till it is ea&s;ily caught by candle-light. They have all the common fruits, and &s;ome of them in greater perfection, than in other parts of England. Their hares and their hounds are &s;aid to be exceeding &s;wift. The Fens &s;eem to have been overun with wood anciently, for trunks of trees are &s;till found in them. The churches in Lincoln&s;hire are &s;aid to be very fine, but the hou&s;es indifferent. There is a homely proverb, which &s;ays, that its hogs &s;h&mdash;t &s;oap, and its cows fire, becau&s;e the poor people wa&s;h their clothes with hogs dung, and, from the &s;carcity of other fuel, burn dried cow-dung. It is intirely in the dioce&s;e of Lincoln, and &s;ends twelve members to parlia|ment, viz. two knights for the &s;hire, two citizens for Lincoln, two burge&s;&s;es for Bo&s;ton, two for Great Grim&s;by, two for Stamford, and two for Grantham.</P>

<HEAD>HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P>It &s;o much re&s;embles the province of that name upon the continent, in mo&s;t re&s;pects, being low and mar&s;hy with the &s;ea on one &s;ide, and canals
<PB N="421" REF="4340">
running through it, that it mu&s;t either have had its name from thence, or at lea&s;t on the &s;ame ac|count. On the ea&s;t it has what the ancient geo|graphers called <HI>Ae&s;tuarium Metaris,</HI> now the Wa&s;hes, which are overflowed at high-water, and part of Cambridge&s;hire on the &s;outh. It is di|vided into higher and lower; the latter is full of bogs and mar&s;hes, and has huge banks to defend it again&s;t the &s;ea and the land floods. The whole divi&s;ion &s;eems to have been gained from the &s;ea. The ground is &s;o &s;oft that hor&s;es are worked un|&s;hod, and it produces plenty of gra&s;s, but little corn. Though there are no &s;tones to be found in or upon the ground, yet the churches are all of &s;tone. They have no fre&s;h water but from the clouds, which is pre&s;erved in pits; but if the&s;e are deep, it &s;oon turns bracki&s;h, and, if they are &s;hallow, they &s;oon become dry.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Bo&s;ton, i. e. Botolph's Town, from a Saxon &s;aint of that name, who is &s;aid to have been the founder of a mona&s;tery here. It &s;tands on the river Witham, which has artificial banks, a wooden bridge, and is navigable to Lincoln. Though in the reign of Ed|ward the Fir&s;t it was plundered, and a great part of it burnt by a band of robbers, it afterwards re|covered, became a &s;taple for wool, and traded with the Han&s;e towns. It has a commodious harbour, and a large beautiful church, the tower of which, being two hundred and eighty two feet in height, &s;erves as a land-mark to &s;eamen, and is &s;een forty miles round. It has three hundred and &s;ixty-five &s;teps, fifty-two windows, and twelve pillars, an&s;wer|able to the days, weeks, and months of the year, and is reckoned the large&s;t in the univer&s;e without cro&s;s-ailes. It is governed by a mayor, who is clerk of the market, and admiral over all the
<PB N="422" REF="4350">
&s;ea-coa&s;ts hereabouts, by grant from queen Eli|zabeth, a recorder, deputy-recorder, twelve al|dermen, a town clerk, eighteen common-coun|cil men, a judge and mar&s;hal of the admiralty, a coroner, two &s;erjeants at mace, &amp;c. Here, be&s;ides St. Botolph's mona&s;tery, were four friaries and three colleges, the revenues of which were given by Henry VIII. to the town. There is a pond in the great common called the We&s;t Fen, whence by pipes, and a water hou&s;e and mill, erected in queen Ann's reign, by act of parlia|ment, the town is &s;upplied with water. The pa&s;|tures about the town are very rich, and feed va&s;t numbers of large &s;heep and oxen. Here the famous Knox, author of the Acts and Monuments, was born. The town gives title of vi&s;count to the earl of Grantham, its markets are on Wed|ne&s;days and Saturdays, and has an annual fair called a mart, which la&s;ts nine days.</P>
<P>Crowland, or Croyland, is a noted town among the fenners, and the name is &s;aid to &s;ignify raw or muddy land. It had antiently a famous mo|na&s;tery founded by Athelbald, king of Mercia, to the honour of God, and the memory of Guthlac, who had been an hermit in the neighbourhood, and a great exorci&s;t. Here is a curious bridge, &s;carce to be equalled in Britain, if in Europe, built in a triangular form, at the conflux of the Nyne and Welland, to an&s;wer the three &s;treets, of which the town con&s;i&s;ts, and which are built on piles driven into the ground. Each &s;treet is &s;eparated from the other by water-cour&s;es, planted with willows. Guthlac lies buried in a little &s;tone cottage, called Anchor-Church-Hou&s;e, near the abbey. The inhabitants make great profit of their decoys, in which they catch an infinite num|ber of ducks. Formerly there were a great many pools about the town, for liberty of fi&s;hing in
<PB N="423" REF="4360">
which, they paid three hundred pounds, fir&s;t to the abbot, and afterwards to the crown; but mo&s;t of the&s;e, by means of drains and &s;luices, are now turned into corn fields. The boggy &s;oil about the town gave ri&s;e to this witty proverb, "That all the carts that came to Croyland were &s;hod with &s;ilver." The people, at lea&s;t antiently, went in little boats called &s;herries to milk their cows, which were kept at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town.</P>
<P>Spalding is a good town, con&s;idering its &s;itua|tion among lakes, canals, and rivers. It has a bridge over the Welland, and a harbour, to which ve&s;&s;els of fifty or &s;ixty tons come up. It had formerly a mona&s;tery, the ruins of which are &s;till vi&s;ible; and has now a free grammar &s;chool for the inhabitants &s;ons. From hence as far as Deep|ing, which is ten miles off, Egelrick, abbot of Crowland, made a firm cau&s;ey, through the mid&s;t of a va&s;t fore&s;t and deep mar&s;hes of wood and gravel, which was called, from his name, Elrich road; but of this nothing now remains.</P>
<P>Kirkton, &s;o called from its &s;tately church, in form of a cathedral, gives name to a hundred.</P>
<P>Dunnington is remarkable only for the large quantities of hemp and hemp-&s;eed bought here. It has a harbour for barges.</P>
<P>Tydd, a &s;mall village, but famous for having been once the rectory of Nicholas Break&s;pear, who planted Chri&s;tianity in Norway, was after|wards made a cardinal, and in 1154, pope, under the name of Adrian IV.</P>
<P>Sutton St. Mary's, remarkable only for having been the birth-place of the famous Dr. Bu&s;by, ma&s;ter of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool.</P>

<P>The &s;econd divi&s;ion is called Ke&s;tevan; by Ethelward, an ancient author, Ceo&s;tefne-wood, becau&s;e there was formerly a great fore&s;t where are now the large fens called Deeping-Fens, &amp;c. and at this day trunks of trees are often dug up; but it was disfore&s;ted for ever by Henry III. This divi&s;ion is larger than Holland, and much more populous, as it is equally fruitful, and en|joys a better air. It is bounded on the &s;outh-ea&s;t by Holland, and on the north by Lind&s;ey, from which it is &s;eparated by the river Witham and the Fo&s;&s;e-dyke.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Two of the towns that &s;end members to par|liament &s;tand in this divi&s;ion, viz. Stamford and Grantham.</P>
<P>Stanford, or Stamford, is &s;o called, becau&s;e it is built of &s;tone. It is the neate&s;t and be&s;t-built town of the county, and finely &s;ituated for plea&s;ure and convenience upon the river Welland, which is na|vigable to it for barges. Here king Edward the El|der built on the &s;outh-bank of the river, over again&s;t the town, a &s;trong ca&s;tle, called now Stanford-ba|ron; but the ca&s;tle, which Stephen fortified in the civil war again&s;t Henry of Anjou, &s;tood in the town. Stowe tells us, there was a mint in Stanford-baron, in the time of king Athel&s;tan, in 930. In the reign of Edward III. if not before, there was an univer&s;ity here; and there are &s;till the remains of two colleges, the one called Black-Hall, and the other Brazen-No&s;e, from a great brazen no&s;e with a ring through it upon the gate, like that at Ox|ford. Here it was that the barons met to levy
<PB N="425" REF="4380">
war upon king John, in who&s;e reign William, earl of Warren, lord of the town, having been much diverted with two bulls, who fighting for a cow in the ca&s;tle meadow and bellowing, brought all the butchers dogs of the place about them, which pur&s;ued and baited one of them quite through the town, gave the whole meadow for a common to the butchers, on condition they &s;hould provide a bull to be baited in like manner every year, &s;ix weeks before Chri&s;tmas; whence came the proverb, "As mad as the baited bull of Stanford." Within this manor the cu&s;tom called Burrough-Engli&s;h takes place, which is, that the younger &s;ons inherit what lands and tenements their fathers die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Here is a free &s;chool, and two ho&s;pitals, one of which was founded by William Cecil, baron of Burleigh, who lies buried in a &s;plendid tomb in St. Martin's pari&s;h church; and in the church adjoining to the bridge is a noble monument of white marble of the late earl and counte&s;s of Exeter, done at Rome, when they were there at the la&s;t jubilee. The town &s;uffered much in the civil wars betwixt the hou&s;es of Lanca&s;ter and York; but is now large, rich, and populous, governed by a mayor, recorder, aldermen, and common council. Here are two noted inns, the George and the Bull, of which the former is the large&s;t, and the other one of the fine&s;t, in England. Of the eighty charity-children kept by this town, &s;ome are wholly maintained and cloathed, and others furni&s;hed with wheels, reels, fire, and candle: they are &s;aid to earn four hundred pounds a year by their labour. The trade of Stamford is chiefly in malt, &s;ea-coal, and free|&s;tone. The inhabitants pretend to a great many privileges, as that they cannot be impannelled on juries out of town; that they are not &s;ubject to the &s;heriffs, or lord lieutenants, but that the militia of
<PB N="426" REF="4390">
the town is to be commanded by their own officers; that the mayor is the king's lieutenant, to who&s;e command alone he is &s;ubject, being the &s;econd man in the kingdom within the liberties of the town; that they have the return of all writs, &amp;c. The barons Grey, of Groby, take the title of earls from this place.</P>
<P>Grantham is an ancient town and corporation, governed by an alderman and twelve ju&s;tices of the peace, a recorder, a coroner, an e&s;cheator, twelve &s;econd-twelve men, who are of the com|mon council, and twelve con&s;tables to attend the court. Lying on the north road, it is full of inns, populous, well built, and flouri&s;hing. It has a large church with a &s;pire two hundred and eighty feet high, which, by a deception of the &s;ight, &s;eems to &s;tand awry; and a good free-&s;chool built and endowed by Richard Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, a native of the town. It was here the great Sir I&s;aac Newton received his fir&s;t edu|cation. It &s;eems to have had a ca&s;tle anciently, and the ruins of many religious hou&s;es are &s;till to be &s;een. Here is a cour&s;e for hor&s;e-races. It gives the title of earl to the family of Robin&s;on.</P>
<P>Sleaford is the only town of any note in this divi&s;ion be&s;ides tho&s;e already mentioned. To di&s;|tingui&s;h it from Old Sleaford in its neighbour|hood, it is called New Sleaford. The ruins of a ca&s;tle built by Alexander, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, are &s;till to be &s;een; and it has a free-&s;chool and an ho&s;pital, both founded and endowed in 1603, by Robert Car, e&s;quire.</P>
<P>In this divi&s;ion is Simpringham, famous here|tofore for the religious order of Gilbertines, in|&s;tituted by one Gilbert, lord of the place. He, by authority of pope Eugenius the Third, anno 1148, (contrary to the con&s;titutions of Ju&s;tinian, which forbad all double mona&s;teries, that is, of
<PB N="427" REF="4400">
men and women promi&s;cuou&s;ly) did introduce an order of men and women; which increa&s;ed to that degree, that he him&s;elf founded thirteen con|vents of this order, and lived to &s;ee in them &s;even hundred Gilbertine friars, and eleven hundred &s;i&s;ters: but their cha&s;tity was not to be boa&s;ted of, if we may believe Nigellus, a &s;atyri&s;t of that age.</P>
<P>Blankeny belonged once to the barons of Dein|courts, an ancient family, of which Edmund was &s;o very earne&s;t to pre&s;erve the memory of his name, that having no i&s;&s;ue male, he petitioned king Edward II. for liberty to make over his ma|nors and arms to whom&s;oever he plea&s;ed; for he imagined that both his name and arms would go to the grave with him, and he was very &s;ollicitous to have them &s;urvive, and be remembered. Ac|cordingly the king complied, and he had letters patent for that end: yet this &s;urname, &s;ays Camb|den, is, for aught I can find, quite extinct, and would have been forgotten for ever, if the me|mory of it had not been pre&s;erved in books.</P>

This is a noble &s;eat of the duke of Rutland, &s;o called from its plea&s;ant pro&s;pect; for it &s;tands on the brow of a hill, and beneath it lies a delicious vale, called from it the Vale of Belvoir. About the ca&s;tle are found the &s;tones called a&s;troites, which re&s;emble little &s;tars, mixed one with another, having five rays in every corner, and in the middle of every ray a hollow. It is &s;aid, that if this &s;tone is put in vinegar, it will move out of its place, and whirl round.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>At Stamford may be &s;een the Roman highway running northward; and here, as &s;ome imagine, &s;tood Gau&s;ennae, from which, they &s;uppo&s;e, this divi&s;ion of the county was called Ke&s;tevan, as Lind&s;ey from Lindum; but others place it at Brigca&s;terton, a mile farther off. Care&s;dyke, or Caerdyke, which was a broad, deep, artificial na|vigable canal, extending formerly from the river Nen, a little below Peterborough, to the river Witham, about three miles below Lincoln, being almo&s;t forty miles, is thought by &s;ome to have been a Roman work. At Paunton, the Roman <HI>ad Pontem,</HI> on account of the bridge that was over the river there, chequered Roman pavements are often dug up. About Anca&s;ter, the ancient Croco|calana, are to be &s;een the ve&s;tiges of &s;everal Ro|man camps, and the military way, where coins are often found. This place and Ke&s;tevan give the title of duke to the family of Bertie. Near this &s;pot, &s;ome imagine the Margidunum of An|toninus &s;tood, while others place it at Market-Overton in Rutland&s;hire. Near the little vil|lage Herlaxton, near Grantham, in Edward the Sixth's time, a brazen ve&s;&s;el was ploughed up, wherein was found an old fa&s;hioned gold helmet, &s;tudded with jewels, which was pre&s;ented to Ca|tharine of Spain, queen to Henry VIII.</P>

It had its name from Lincoln, the capital of the county, which &s;tands in it, and by the Romans called <HI>Lindum,</HI> by the Britons <HI>Lyndcoit,</HI> by the Saxons <HI>Lindo-collyne,</HI> probably from its &s;ituation on a hill, and the lakes or woods that were an|ciently thereabouts; but the Normans called it <HI>Nichol.</HI> It gives title of earl and marquis to the duke of Anca&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The city of Lincoln &s;tands on the &s;ide of a hill, at the bottom of which runs the river Witham. The old <HI>Lindum</HI> of the Britons, which &s;tood on the top of the hill, as appears from the ve&s;tiges of a rampart, and deep ditches &s;till remaining, was taken and demoli&s;hed by the Saxons, who built a town upon the &s;outh &s;ide of the hill down to the river &s;ide, which was &s;everal times taken by the Danes, and as often retaken by the Saxons. In Edward the Confe&s;&s;or's time, it appears, from Doom&s;day-book, to have been a very con&s;iderable place; and in the time of the Normans, Malm&s;|bury &s;ays, it was one of the mo&s;t populous cities in England. William I. built a ca&s;tle upon the &s;ummit of the hill above the town. The dioce&s;e, though the bi&s;hopric of Ely was taken out of it by Henry II. and tho&s;e of Peterborough and Ox|ford by Henry VIII. is &s;till va&s;tly large, contain|ing the counties of Leice&s;ter, Huntingdon, Bedford, and part of Bucks, making one thou&s;and
<PB N="430" REF="4430">
two hundred and fifty-five pari&s;hes. Though the other churches are mean, the cathedral, or min|&s;ter, is a mo&s;t magnificent piece of Gothic archi|tecture. Here is a prodigious large bell, called Tom of Lincoln, which is near five ton in weight, and twenty-three feet in compa&s;s. The hill on which the church &s;tands is &s;o high, and the church it&s;elf &s;o lofty, that it may be &s;een fifty miles to the north, and thirty to the &s;outh. Be&s;ides other tombs, it contains one of bra&s;s, in which are the entrails of queen Eleanor, wife to Edward I. It is &s;aid there were anciently fifty-two churches which are now reduced to thirteen. Such is the magnificence and elevation of the cathedral, that the monks thought the &s;ight of it mu&s;t be very mortifying to the devil; whence it came to be &s;aid of one who was di&s;plea&s;ed, "that he looked like the devil over Lincoln." There have been &s;everal famous bi&s;hops of this place, be&s;ides Reme|gius, who removed the &s;ee hither from Dorche&s;|ter in Oxford&s;hire, purcha&s;ed the ground where the church &s;tands, built and endowed it; as, for in&s;tance, Robert Bloet, on whom William Rufus laid a fine of fifty thou&s;and pounds, alledging that his title to the city of Lincoln was not good; Alexander, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for his genero&s;ity and magnificence, and to whom the min&s;ter is chiefly indebted for its grandeur; for, &s;ays William of Malm&s;bury, "be|ing looked on as a prodigy for the &s;mallne&s;s of his body, he &s;trove to excel in mind, and make the greater figure;" Hugo Burgundus, who being canonized, had his corp&s;e carried to the grave on the &s;houlders of king John and his nobles, out of re&s;pect, as Howden &s;ays, to God and the &s;ainted prelate; and, to mention no more, Robert Grote&s;t, i. e. Greathead, who is &s;aid to have been, "an awful reprover of the pope, a monitor to the king, a lover of truth, a corrector of pre|lates,
<PB N="431" REF="4440">
a director of prie&s;ts, an in&s;tructor of the clergy, a preacher to the people, a diligent &s;earcher of &s;cripture, and a mallet to the Ro|mani&s;ts, &amp;c." The declivity on which the city is built being &s;o &s;teep, the communication betwixt the upper and lower town is very trouble&s;ome, and coaches and hor&s;es are obliged to make a com|pa&s;s. The little river Witham runs through the town, and on the we&s;t &s;ide forms a large pool, called from the number of &s;wans upon it, Swan|pool, which has a communication with the Trent by a canal, called the Fo&s;s-dyke. In the upper town many gentlemen, be&s;ides the prebendaries and others of the clergy, have hand&s;ome hou&s;es of modern architecture. There are four charity|&s;chools, in each of which thirty poor children are taught by clergymen's widows. It is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, who are ju&s;tices of the peace, two &s;heriffs, a recorder, four chamberlains, a &s;word-bearer, four coroners, and above forty com|mon-council, and has a vi&s;contial juri&s;diction twenty miles round, a privilege which no other city in England can boa&s;t of. The country round is very fertile and plea&s;ant, and the tract called Lincoln-heath extends above fifty miles. On the down, towards Bo&s;ton, are &s;ometimes &s;een tho&s;e rare birds called bu&s;tards. Here are frequent hor&s;e races, markets on Tue&s;day and Friday, fairs fir&s;t Tue&s;day in April, June twenty-four, fir&s;t Friday in September, and November &s;eventeen. It has given the title of earl to the family of Clin|ton, ever &s;ince the reign of queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Other towns and places any ways remarkable in this divi&s;ion are,</P>
<P>Great Grim&s;by, a parliamentary borough, and the &s;econd, if not the fir&s;t, corporation in the king|dom. It &s;tands half a mile from the Humber, and was a place of great trade before its harbour was choaked up. What trade it has now is in

It had formerly two mona&s;teries, a nunnery, and ca&s;tle; and is governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, twelve aldermen, of whom the mayor is one, twelve common council-men, two bailiffs, two coroners, a town-clerk, and three &s;erjeants at mace.</P>
<P>Gain&s;borough, one of the be&s;t towns in the county, &s;tanding on the Trent, by which &s;hips come up to the town with the tide, though it is forty miles from the Humber.

<P>Wainfleet, a neat town, and noted for giving birth and &s;urname to William Wainfleet, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who founded a free-&s;chool in the town, Magdalen-college in Oxford, and was a great patron of learning. His father hath a fair monument of alaba&s;ter &s;till remaining in the church.</P>
<P>Louth, a corporation and market-town of good re&s;ort, which takes its name from Lud, a rivulet that runs by Cockerington. It has a free-&s;chool founded by Edward VI. and a &s;tately church, the &s;teeple of which is one of the highe&s;t in England.</P>
<P>Horn-Ca&s;tle, a large town on the river Bane. This plainly appears to have been a Roman &s;ta|tion, both from the ca&s;tle, which is Roman work, and was immen&s;ely large, taking up twenty acres, as appears from what remains of it, and al&s;o from the Roman coins found here.</P>
<P>Axholm, or Axelholm, is an i&s;land formed by the Trent, Dun, and Idle, in length ten miles, but not half &s;o broad. The lower part near

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>In Lincoln are the remains of many religious hou&s;es and mona&s;teries, with which the city abound|ed. The Roman gate, called Newport-gate, is &s;till entire, and a very noble piece of antiquity it is. By this gate is another Roman work, called the Mint|wall, con&s;i&s;ting of alternate layers of brick and &s;tone, &s;ixteen feet high, and above forty long. Be&s;ides this, there are other fragments of the wall in many parts of the city. Over-again&s;t the ca&s;tle, to the we&s;t, is an entrenchment made by king Stephen. John of Gaunt, duke of Lanca&s;|ter, lived here like a king, and had a mint; and here his arms are &s;till to be &s;een carved in &s;tone. Sepulchral monuments of the Normans are often found in this city.</P>
<P>The High-Dyke, called by the country peo|ple, the High-Street, being ca&s;t up to a great height, and about &s;even yards broad, pa&s;&s;es from Stamford to Lincoln; thence northward to a village called the Spittle in the Street; thence
<PB N="437" REF="4500">
to Hiber&s;tow; then through Scawby-wood, by Broughton; then through Appleby-lane. At all the&s;e places are the remains of Roman buildings and coins; and at Broughton is a petrifying &s;pring, with petrified &s;hells, of which &s;ome have fi&s;h in them. The way then pa&s;&s;es on to the Humber, at no great di&s;tance from Roxby and Winterton, Alkborough and Wintringham, where, and at Winterton-cliff, the remains of Roman build|ings, pavements, and camps are to be &s;een.</P>

According to Templeman it extends in length fifty &s;even miles, in breadth thirty-five, and one hundred and forty in circumference.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air differs in different parts of the county, according to the &s;oil, which in &s;ome parts is mar&s;hy, e&s;pecially on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and there the air is foggy and unwhole&s;ome: in others it is clayey and chalky, poor, lean, and &s;andy, and there the air is good. The county is almo&s;t all champaign, except in &s;ome places, where ri&s;e gentle hills. The mar&s;hlands yield rich pa&s;ture for cattle, the clay-grounds peas, rye, and bar|ley, and the &s;andy-heaths feed va&s;t flocks of large &s;heep, of which &s;ome villages are &s;aid to keep four or five thou&s;and. The&s;e heaths abound al&s;o in rabbits of a &s;ilver grey colour. When a &s;tranger on his coming into the low fenny country is &s;eized with an ague, they &s;ay he is arre&s;ted by the bailiff of Mar&s;hland. Wal&s;ingham is noted for producing the be&s;t &s;affron. Great quantities of mackarel and herrings are caught upon the coa&s;ts of this county, the former in the &s;pring, and the latter in September; e&s;pecially at Yarmouth, where they are cured in a particular manner, and to great perfection. Wood and honey are al&s;o very plen|tiful in this &s;hire; and on the coa&s;ts jet and ambergrea&s;e are &s;ometimes found. The inhabi|tants are generally &s;trong and active, &s;agacious and acute. That they are &s;o robu&s;t, is the more to be wondered at, becau&s;e the common people

<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The county is well watered, and &s;upplied with fi&s;h by the rivers Yare, Thyrn, Waveney, the Greater and Le&s;&s;er Ou&s;e, and the Bure, be&s;ides rivulets. The Bure abounds in excellent perch, and the Yare has a fi&s;h peculiar to it, called the ruffe. The latter ri&s;es about the middle of the county, and after being joined by the Waveney and Bure, falls into the &s;ea at Yarmouth. At the equinoxes, e&s;pecially the autumnal, the Ou&s;e is &s;ubject to great inundations, being forced back by the &s;ea that enters it with great fury.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Norwich, a city, and the capital of the county, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had its name, which &s;ignifies
<PB N="441" REF="4540">
a ca&s;tle to the north, from its &s;ituation in re|&s;pect of Ca&s;tor, the antient Venta Icenorum, three or four miles to the &s;outh of it, out of who&s;e ruins it &s;eems to have ri&s;en. In its in|fancy, in the reign of Etheldred, it was plun|dered and burnt by Sueno the Dane, when he in|vaded England with a great army. Afterwards it recovered; and in the reign of Edward the Con|fe&s;&s;or was a con&s;iderable place, having one thou|&s;and three hundred and twenty burghers. But it &s;uffered again much in the reign of William I. by being the &s;eat of a civil war, which Ralph, earl of the Ea&s;t Angles, rai&s;ed again&s;t that king. So much was it impaired by the &s;iege it then un|derwent, that there were &s;carce five hundred and &s;ixty burghers left in it, as appears from Doom&s;day|book. From that time forward it began by little and little to recover, e&s;pecially after bi&s;hop Her|bert tran&s;lated the epi&s;copal &s;ee hither from Thet|ford in the reign of William Rufus, anno 1096, and built a beautiful cathedral, of which he him&s;elf laid the fir&s;t &s;tone, with this in&s;cription, <HI>Dominus Herbertus po&s;uit primum lapidem, in Nomine Patris, Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti,</HI> Amen. i. e. Lord (bi&s;hop) Herbert laid the fir&s;t &s;tone, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, and by a licence from pope Pa&s;chal, declared it the mother-church of Norfolk and Suffolk. After this, as Malm&s;|bury has it, it became a town famous for merchan|dize and the number of inhabitants. Yet it was mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed in the reign of Henry II. by Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk, who was an ad|herent of Henry's &s;on, called the junior king. In the time of Edward I. it was walled round by the citizens, who had pre&s;ented a petition to par|liament for liberty to do it. Henry IV. allowed them, in&s;tead of bailiffs, which they had before, to elect a mayor yearly, and made the city a
<PB N="442" REF="4550">
county of it&s;elf. In the year 1348, near fifty-eight per&s;ons were carried off by the plague, and in 1507 the city was almo&s;t con&s;umed by fire. For the flouri&s;hing &s;tate to which the city is now ar|rived, they are much indebted to the Flemings, who fled hither from the tyranny of the duke of Alva and the inqui&s;ition, and taught them the manufacture of tho&s;e &s;triped and flowered dama&s;ks, camblets, druggets, black and white crape, for which the place is now &s;o noted, and which have been computed to yield &s;ometimes a hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds a year. In the year 1583, the citizens, by the help of an engine, conveyed water through pipes to the highe&s;t parts of the city, which is plea&s;antly &s;eated along the &s;ide of a hill, extending a mile and a half in length from &s;outh to north; but the breadth is much le&s;s, and it contracts it&s;elf by degrees towards the &s;outh. It is now one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in Britain for wealth, populou&s;ne&s;s, neat buildings, beautiful churches, of which it had once fifty, but now about thirty, and the in|du&s;try and civility of the inhabitants. The ca|thedral is a very venerable &s;tructure, with a cu|rious roof, adorned with the hi&s;tory of the Bible in little images, carved to the life, and a lofty &s;teeple a hundred and five yards high. The wall of flint &s;tone, beautified with forty towers, and twelve gates, fini&s;hed in 1309, is now much decayed. The city, though there is a great deal of wa&s;te ground within the walls, was computed, upwards of thirty years ago, to contain eight thou&s;and hou&s;es, and fifty thou&s;and inhabitants. Be&s;ides the cathedral already mentioned, the mo&s;t remarkable buildings are, the duke of Norfolk's hou&s;e, one of the large&s;t in England; the ca&s;tle, which is now the county gaol, and &s;tands in the heart of the city, with a deep moat round it,
<PB N="443" REF="4560">
over which is a bridge of one very large arch; the Town-hall; the Guild-hall, formerly the church belonging to the mona&s;tery of Black-Friars; the hou&s;e of correction; the &s;hire-hou&s;e, where the a&s;&s;izes are held; a lofty market cro&s;s, built after the manner of a piazza; the bi&s;hop's palace; the king's &s;chool, founded by Edward VI. the boys to be nominated by the mayor for the time being, with the con&s;ent of the majority of aldermen. There having been formerly many thatched hou&s;es, an order was made, that all that &s;hould hereafter be built, &s;hould be covered with tiles. The city is inter&s;per&s;ed with gardens, orch|ards and trees, which make it both plea&s;ant and healthful. It has four ho&s;pitals, in which a great number of old men and women, boys and girls, are maintained, and a dozen charity &s;chools. Here are two churches for the Dutch and French Flem|ings, who have particular privileges, and are very numerous. Some of the churches are thatched, and all of them cru&s;ted with flint &s;tone curiou&s;ly cut, which is the more wonderful, as Norwich &s;tands in a clay country, and has no flint within twenty miles of it. It is now governed by a mayor, recorder, &s;teward, two &s;heriffs, twenty|four aldermen, &s;ixty common-council, with a town-clerk, &s;word-bearer, and other inferior offi|cers. The mayor is cho&s;en on May-day by the freemen, and &s;worn in on the Tue&s;day before Mid&s;ummer-eve. The &s;heriffs are al&s;o cho&s;en annually, on the fir&s;t Tue&s;day in Augu&s;t, one by the freemen, the other by the aldermen, and &s;worn in on Michaelmas day. The freemen of the &s;everal wards chu&s;e each their alderman. The common council is cho&s;en in Midlent. The mayor is a ju&s;tice of the peace and quorum, during his year (as are al&s;o the recorder and &s;teward) within the city and liberties, and after his mayoralty, he
<PB N="444" REF="4570">
is a ju&s;tice during life. The trade and manu|factures of the city are very con&s;iderable. At Yarmouth they export large quantities of their manufactures, mo&s;t of which are &s;ent to London, and import a great deal of wine, coal, fi&s;h, oil, &amp;c. All the city and country round are employed in the wor&s;ted manufacture, brought hither, as already ob&s;erved, by the Flemings, in which they not only con&s;ume the wool of their own county, in &s;pinning, weaving, &amp;c. but u&s;e many thou&s;and packs of yarn, which they receive from other parts of England, as far as York&s;hire and We&s;t|morland. There are eight wardens of the weavers cho&s;en annually, and &s;worn to take care that there be no frauds committed in &s;pin|ning, weaving, or dying the &s;tuffs. It is com|puted that there are not le&s;s than a hundred and twenty thou&s;and people employed in and about the city in the &s;ilk and woollen manufactures. Their markets are thought to be the greate&s;t in England, and furni&s;hed with a &s;urprizing plenty and variety of goods and provi&s;ions. At a &s;mall village to the north of the city called St. Faith's, not le&s;s than forty thou&s;and head of Scotch cattle are &s;aid to be yearly bought up by the Norfolk graziers, and fattened in their meadows and mar&s;hes. Its markets are on Wedne&s;day, Friday, and Sa|turday. It has a great number of fairs, and gives title of earl to the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>Great Yarmouth, &s;o called from its &s;tanding at the mouth of the Yare, &s;eems to have ri&s;en from the ruins of Gariononum. Here Cerdic the va|liant Saxon landed, whence the place at this day is called Cerdic Sand, or Cerdic Shore. Not long after, the Saxons, in&s;tead of Gariononum, built a town in the moi&s;t watery field on the we&s;t-&s;ide of the river; but afterwards, that proving un|whol&s;ome, on the ea&s;t-&s;ide, on Cerdic Sand, and called it Yarmouth, where, in the time of Ed|ward
<PB N="445" REF="4580">
the Confe&s;&s;or, were &s;eventy burghers. In the year 1340, the citizens walled it round, and &s;oon grew &s;o rich and powerful, that they had often &s;ea-fights with their neighbours of Leo&s;toff, and the Cinque Ports, on account of their being ex|cluded the number, and deprived of their pri|vileges; but afterwards they &s;uffered much by a plague, which in one year carried off &s;even thou|&s;and &s;ouls. The town applied it&s;elf afterwards to the herring fi&s;hery, and by degrees became &s;o con&s;iderable, that now it is one of the wealthie&s;t, large&s;t, and mo&s;t populous towns in England. The roads, as they are &s;o called, to the ea&s;t of the town, are almo&s;t con&s;tantly crowded with colliers, and other &s;hips, bound either to the &s;outh or north. It is &s;aid that here and at the little town of Leo&s;toff, not le&s;s than thirty or forty thou&s;and la&s;ts, containing betwixt thirty and forty millions of red herrings, are taken and cured in a year. The &s;ea&s;on for catching the&s;e herrings is about Michaelmas, when there is a fair, at which immen&s;e quantities of them are bought and &s;old, to be con&s;umed at home, or exported to Italy, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. Be&s;ides this trade, they export prodigious quantities of coal, and woollen goods, which employs a con&s;iderable number of hands. There is almo&s;t as great a fi&s;hing for mackarel in the &s;pring, as for herrings in September. They import va&s;t quantities of cod from the North Seas, and all manner of naval &s;tores from Norway and the Baltic, which are mo&s;tly con|&s;umed in their own port, where a great num|ber of &s;hips are built every year. Upwards of fifty years ago, more than eleven hundred &s;ail belonged to this town. It can &s;end goods to Nor|wich, and almo&s;t all over the county, and even to Suffolk, by water. Some commi&s;&s;aries from the Cinque Ports, in con&s;equence of an old cu&s;tom,
<PB N="446" REF="4590">
during the herring fair, hold a court together with the magi&s;trates of the town, to determine all controver&s;ies, and keep the peace. The mer|chants and traders are accounted very fair dealers, and the &s;eamen the able&s;t and mo&s;t expert of any in England. It is the mo&s;t regular built town in the kingdom, the &s;treets running parallel with one another, from north to &s;outh. It is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the river, the harbour, and the &s;ea, and has be&s;ides a wall. Its market-place is the fine&s;t, and perhaps be&s;t furni&s;hed of any in England, and there is not a nobler or more &s;pacious key in Europe, if we except that of Seville in Spain. It has two pari&s;h churches: the &s;teeple of St. Nicholas is &s;o high that it &s;erves for a &s;ea-mark. Over the river is a draw|bridge. It co&s;ts the inhabitants two or three thou&s;and pounds a year to keep the harbour clear of mud and &s;and. The town-hou&s;e and cu&s;tom|hou&s;e are al&s;o fine buildings. There are two charity &s;chools, in one of which the boys are taught, be&s;ides reading and writing, to make nets: there is al&s;o a fine ho&s;pital. The har|bour is defended by a platform with guns upon a little &s;lip of land at the entrance of it. In the neighbourhood of this town are banks of &s;and, which are &s;hifted by the winds, and on which &s;hips are often ca&s;t away. The coa&s;t is ex|tremely dangerous and fatal to &s;eamen; and &s;o many &s;hips have been wrecked upon it, notwith|&s;tanding the many light-hou&s;es that are kept flaming all night, and the beacons and &s;ea marks all along from hence to Cromer, that all the &s;heds, outhou&s;es, pales, &amp;c. are made of wrecks, be&s;ides great piles of them laid up for the purpo&s;es of building. The danger is if a &s;hip coming from the north is taken with a hard gale of wind at &s;outh-ea&s;t, or any point between north-ea&s;t and
<PB N="447" REF="4600">
&s;outh-ea&s;t, and cannot weather Winterton Ne&s;s, they are then kept within the great bay of Cro|mer, lying between Winterton and the Spurn|head in York&s;hire, called by the &s;eamen the devil's throat, and unle&s;s they can ride it out, or get to Lynn or Bo&s;ton, at the bottom of the bay, which is a de&s;perate pu&s;h, they mu&s;t certainly be ca&s;t away, either upon the rocks about Cromer, or the flat &s;hore between Cromer and Wells. In like manner &s;hips bound to the north, if they are caught by a north-ea&s;t wind, and embayed, are in the utmo&s;t danger of peri&s;hing. In the year 1696, two hundred &s;ail of colliers, and other &s;hips, not being able to weather Winterton Ne&s;s, and running away for Lynn deeps, mi&s;&s;ed their way in the dark, and peri&s;hed with all on board, to the number of about a thou&s;and per&s;ons. By virtue of a charter from Henry III. the town is governed by two bailiffs and a recorder, who are ju&s;tices of the peace, aldermen, and common-council. By a charter of Henry III. the town is obliged to &s;end an hundred herrings, baked in twenty-four pa&s;ties, every year to the &s;heriff of Norwich, by whom they are to be de|livered to the lord of the manor of Ea&s;t Carleton in this county, and by him conveyed to the king. It has a market on Wedne&s;days and Saturdays, and be&s;ides others has a fi&s;hing fair, that con|tinues all the month of October.</P>
<P>Lynn, or Lynn Regis, is an ancient town at the mouth of the Ou&s;e. It was formerly called Bi&s;hops Lynn; becau&s;e, till Henry the Eighth's time, it belonged to the bi&s;hops of Norwich; but coming then into the king's hands, it took the name of Lynn Regis, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Old Lynn. The origin of the name Lynn is uncertain. It is a large well-built town, and was formerly very &s;trong, as appears by the remains of the old for|tifications.
<PB N="448" REF="4610">
It has a good harbour, though of difficult acce&s;s, by rea&s;on of the flats and &s;hoals that lie in the way: but the &s;hoals have all buoys, and there are many good pilots. For the defence of the town and harbour, there is a platform at the north end, mounting twelve guns. The river here is very broad, and the tide ri&s;es twenty foot perpendicular. It has two churches, the &s;pires of which were blown down in 1741; but they have been &s;ince rebuilt, towards which, and other damages, his late maje&s;ty gave a thou&s;and and the earl of Orford five hundred pounds. It has al&s;o a chapel of ea&s;e, a pre&s;byterian and quakers meeting-hou&s;e, a workhou&s;e, &s;everal ho&s;pitals and alms-hou&s;es, a free-&s;chool, a good cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, quay, and warehou&s;es, be&s;ides a &s;tately town-hou&s;e, called Trinity-hall, and an hand&s;ome exchange, the latter of which was built at the expence of Sir John Turner. St. Nicho|las-chapel is a very ancient and a very noble fa|bric, and the Gray-friars &s;teeple a noted &s;ea|mark. At St. Nicholas's-chapel is a library erected by &s;ub&s;cription, and there is another at St. Margaret's. The market-place is very &s;paci|ous, and the market-hou&s;e is a hand&s;ome build|ing, &s;eventy feet high, and decorated with &s;tatues and other embelli&s;hments. The trade of the town is very con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in coals and wine, with which they &s;upply &s;everal of the neigh|bouring counties, by means of the river Ou&s;e, and bring back va&s;t quantities of corn for expor|tation. Their corre&s;pondence and trade to Hol|land, Norway, the Baltic, Spain, and Portugal, is &s;aid to be very great. As to the government of the town, it had a provo&s;t and great privileges granted it by king John, for taking part with him again&s;t the barons, from whom it had al&s;o a large &s;ilver cup with a cover, of about eighty
<PB N="449" REF="4620">
ounces doubly gilt and enamelled, together with four large &s;ilver maces, which are borne before the mayor. But the &s;word, which is al&s;o borne before the mayor, is &s;aid to have been received from Henry VIII. It has had no fewer than fif|teen royal charters, and is at pre&s;ent governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, under-&s;teward, re|corder, twelve aldermen, and eighteen common|council-men. It gives title of baron to lord vi&s;|count Town&s;hend.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to Lynn lies Mar&s;hland, a low mar&s;hy tract, almo&s;t &s;urrounded with rivers, and an arm of the &s;ea, and full of drains and ditches. It contains about thirty thou&s;and acres, in a part of which called Tilney Smeath, the &s;oil being very rich, and fitter for gra&s;s than corn, are fed upwards of thirty thou&s;and &s;heep, be&s;ides black cattle. It is now fenced by a &s;trong wall again&s;t the inun|dations to which it was formerly fequently ex|po&s;ed, both from the &s;ea and rivers, and yields plenty of corn as well as gra&s;s. In this neigh|bourhood is Walpole, from which the ance&s;tors of the Walpole family took their name. It &s;ig|nifies, according to Dr. Gib&s;on, a pool near the wall or rampire.</P>
<P>Thetford, &s;ituated at the conflux of the Thet, and the le&s;&s;er Ou&s;e, in a low ground, was an|tiently called Sitomagus, i. e. according to Camb|den, a city upon the Sit, the old name of the Thet, and was formerly famous for being a &s;eat of the kings of the Ea&s;t Angles. In 1004 it was burnt by Sueno the Dane, and &s;ix years after plundered by the Danes. But it recovered, upon the epi&s;|copal &s;ee being removed hither from Elmham, by Arfa&s;tus, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;or William &s;pared nei|ther pains nor co&s;t in beautifying it; &s;o that, under Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, it had nine hundred
<PB N="450" REF="4630">
and forty-&s;even burge&s;&s;es. It was very con&s;ider|able in William the Conqueror's time, and its chief magi&s;trate was &s;tiled con&s;ul; but it fell to decay, after the &s;ee was tran&s;lated to Norwich by Herbert, &s;urnamed Lo&s;enga. It had antiently three mona&s;teries, particularly one of the Cluniacks, and near the town is a huge mount, ca&s;t up to a great height, antiently fortified with walls and a double rampart. Near this town, as we are told, a bloody battle was fought by the holy king Ed|mund with the Danes. In the reign of James I. an ho&s;pital, grammar-&s;chool, and maintenance of a preacher for ever, was founded here by Sir Ri|chard Fulmar&s;ton, knight; and, in the time of Charles II. Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, was a great benefactor to this place. It is a pretty large town, with three churches, though but thinly peopled. By a charter from queen Elizabeth, it is governed by a mayor, recorder, ten aldermen, twenty common-council, a town-clerk, &s;word|bearer, and mace-bearer. Here the Lent a&s;&s;izes are u&s;ually held; and its chief manufacture is woollen cloth.</P>

<P>The air of this county is allowed to be as plea|&s;ant, &s;weet, and whole&s;ome, as that of any other in England, there being nothing either in the &s;oil or &s;ituation to render it otherwi&s;e. The &s;oil throughout is excellent, and inferior to none, either for grain, fruit, or pa&s;ture, &s;upplying the inhabitants plentifully with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life: but that by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from mo&s;t others, is its fruit, e&s;pecially apples, of which it produces &s;uch quantities, that the cyder made of them is not only &s;ufficient for their own con&s;umption, tho' it is their ordinary drink, but al&s;o in a great mea&s;ure for that of London and other parts. That in particular which is made from the apple called red&s;treak, is much admired, and has a body almo&s;t equal to that of white wine. Lem&s;ter, in this county, is noted for the finene&s;s both of its wool and bread.

It is very plea&s;antly &s;ituated among mea|dows and corn-fields, and is almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed with rivers. It &s;eems to have owed its ri&s;e, or at lea&s;t its increa&s;e, to the building and dedicating a church there to Ethelbert, king of the Ea&s;t An|gles, who was murdered in the neighbourhood, and afterwards taken into the catalogue of martyrs: &s;oon after it became a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and in con&s;e|quence of that a con&s;iderable place. In 1055 it was &s;acked, the cathedral de&s;troyed, and its bi&s;hop Leofgar carried away captive, by Gryffin, prince of South Wales, and Algar, an Engli&s;hman, who had rebelled again&s;t Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. Ha|rold fortified it with a broad and high rampart; and it appears by Doom&s;day-book, that there were no more than three hundred men within and with|out the wall. A very large and &s;trong ca&s;tle was built by the Normans along the Wye, and the city walled round. The pre&s;ent &s;tately cathedral was founded in the reign of Henry I. by bi&s;hop Reinelm, but enlarged and beautified by his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors. It &s;uffered much in the barons wars; and was often taken and retaken in the war between king Charles I. and the parliament. This city is pretty large, and had once &s;ix churches; but two were de&s;troyed in the civil wars. It is not very populous, nor well built, many of the hou&s;es be|ing old. Its manufactures are gloves and other leathern goods; and its corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, &s;ix aldermen, a high &s;teward, deputy &s;teward, and town-clerk, who have a &s;word-bearer, and four &s;erjeants at mace. Each of the compa|nies enjoys di&s;tinct laws and privileges by their charter, and each has its hall. The clergy belong|ing to the cathedral are, be&s;ides the bi&s;hop, a chan|cellor,

&s;ixteen canons, twenty-&s;even prebendaries, a chanter, a trea&s;urer, twelve vicars choral, with deacons, and choiri&s;ters. The city gave long the title of earl to the noble family of the Bohuns; then of duke to Henry of Lanca&s;ter, afterwards Henry IV. king of England; after him, of earl to Stafford, earl of Buckingham; then of vi&s;count to D'Evereux, earl of E&s;&s;ex, which a collateral branch of his family &s;till enjoys, and is thereby the premier vi&s;count of England.</P>
<P>Leomin&s;ter, or Lem&s;ter, is &s;o called, as it is thought by &s;ome, from the Briti&s;h <HI>Lhan-Lieni,</HI> &s;ignifying a church of nuns; for here Merewalch, a Mercian king, founded a church for nuns. Others derive it from linum, flax, which grows here re|markably good. On a hill &s;ide, near the town, the afore&s;aid Merwald, or Merewalch, is &s;aid to have had a ca&s;tle or palace: but, as we ob&s;erved before, Leomin&s;ter is now mo&s;t noted for its wool and bread. It is a large populous borough, and a great thoroughfare. Its trade in hats, wool, leather, and wheat, is very con&s;iderable, and its fairs are noted for hor&s;es and black cattle. Lem|&s;ter ore was the name given to its wool once, &s;o much wealth did it bring the town. It has now a &s;tately church, and had formerly a priory. Over the Lug there are &s;everal bridges.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>This being an inland county, well cultivated, and free from lakes, mar&s;hes, or &s;tagnant waters, the air is very &s;weet and whole&s;ome all over it. The &s;oil in general is very rich, producing corn, fruit, e&s;pecially pears, of which they make a great deal of perry, hops, and pa&s;ture. The hills are covered with &s;heep, and the meadows with cattle. Hence they have wool, cloth, &s;tuffs, butter, and chee&s;e in abundance. They are al&s;o well &s;upplied with fuel, either wood or coal, and &s;alt from their brine pits and &s;alt &s;prings. Of the la&s;t they have not only enough for them&s;elves, but export large quantities by the Severn, which noble river, to the great convenience and emolument of the in|habitants, runs from north to &s;outh thro' the very middle of the county, enriching the &s;oil, and yielding it plenty of fi&s;h, and an ea&s;y expedi|tious conveyance of goods to and from it.

other &s;ide of the Severn. It was made an epi&s;co|pal &s;ee about the year 680 by Sexulphus, bi&s;hop of the Mercians; but the pre&s;ent cathedral was begun by Wul&s;ton, in the year 1084. The town hath been &s;everal times burnt down: fir&s;t, in 1041, by Hardicanute, who al&s;o ma&s;&s;acred the citizens; &s;econdly, not long after William Rufus's time; and a third time, when king Stephen be&s;ieged and took it. Here, in later times, was fought that battle, in which Charles II. with his Scotch army, was defeated by Cromwell. In a garden; near the &s;outh gate of the city, where the action was hotte&s;t, the bones of the &s;lain are often dug up. It had formerly &s;trong walls, and a ca&s;tle; but the&s;e have been demoli&s;hed long ago. It is now a large city, the &s;treets broad and well paved; and &s;ome of them very regular and well built, par|ticularly Foregate-&s;treet; &s;o that, in general, it is a very agreeable place. The cathedral is a &s;tately edifice, and among other monuments in it, are tho&s;e of king John, of Arthur, elder brother to Henry VIII. and of the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, who gave occa&s;ion to the in&s;titution of the order of the Garter. There are &s;even or eight ho&s;pitals in and about the city, of which that built and en|dowed by Robert Berkley, of Spetchley, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> is a very noble one. There is a &s;chool founded by Henry VIII. three other &s;chools, and &s;ix charity &s;chools. The Guildhall, and the workhou&s;e, are &s;tately &s;tructures. The churches, St. Nicholas and All-Saints, have been lately rebuilt, and are very hand&s;ome edifices. The city carries on a great trade, for which it is chiefly indebted to its &s;ituation up|on the Severn. A prodigious number of people are employed in and about it, in the manufacture of broad cloth and gloves. The Welch inhabit a part of it, and &s;peak their own language. Its
<PB N="463" REF="4760">
market is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, corn, and cattle, and its key is much frequented by &s;hips. By a charter from James I. it is governed by a mayor, &s;ix aldermen, who are ju&s;tices of the peace, and cho&s;en out of twenty-four capital citizens, a &s;heriff, the city being a county of it&s;elf, a com|mon council, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-eight other citi|zens, out of which two chamberlains are yearly cho&s;en, a recorder, town clerk, two coroners, a &s;word-bearer, thirteen con&s;tables, and four &s;er|jeants at mace. Of the bi&s;hops of this &s;ee, there have been, it is &s;aid, one pope, four &s;aints, &s;even lord high-chancellors, eleven archbi&s;hops, two lord trea&s;urers, one chancellor to the queen, one lord pre&s;ident of Wales, and one vice-pre&s;ident.

<P>Droitwich, upon the river Salwarp, is remarka|ble for its &s;alt &s;prings and brine pits, though it is at a great di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and has a river of fre&s;h water running by it. Of the water of the&s;e &s;prings is made the pure&s;t and white&s;t kind of &s;alt in little hou&s;es built about them. The quan|tity may be judged of by the taxes paid from thence to the crown, amounting to above fifty thou|&s;and pounds a year, at the rate of three &s;hillings and &s;ix pence a bu&s;hel. They formerly made u&s;e of wood in the&s;e &s;alt-works; but that not being equal to &s;o great and con&s;tant a con&s;umption, they now burn coal, and not wood, in their boiling-hou&s;es. That they were known and u&s;ed before the Con|que&s;t appears from Doom&s;day-book, in which is the following pa&s;&s;age: "In which there be eight fats of &s;alt belonging to the king and the earl, which, in every week of wealling, yield on the Friday &s;ixteen bullings."

The proprietors of the &s;alt pits are a corporation, and none can be a burge&s;s of Droitwich, or vote for members of parliament, unle&s;s he has &s;ome pro|perty in the &s;prings.

At the reque&s;t of prince Henry, James the Fir&s;t granted them a new charter, by which the corpo|ration con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, &s;even aldermen, twelve ca|pital burge&s;&s;es, a recorder, and chamberlain, who are all of the common-council, be&s;ides twenty-four other burge&s;&s;es, called a&s;&s;i&s;tants, with juri&s;diction over the neighbouring pari&s;h of Bengworth, and other privileges, particularly a power to try and exe|cute felons within the borough. Here was formerly a ca&s;tle; and now there are two pari&s;h churches, a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge over the Avon, with a har|bour for barges, a grammar &s;chool, and two charity-&s;chools, for maintaining of which, Mr. Deacle, a woollen-draper in London, left three thou&s;and pounds. From this town, that rich va|ley which runs along the banks of the Avon, to Stratford, takes its name.

<HEAD>WARWICKSHIRE. BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Warwick&s;hire is bounded on the ea&s;t by North|ampton&s;hire, Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and the military way called Watling-&s;treet; on the &s;outh by Ox|ford&s;hire and Glouce&s;ter&s;hire; on the we&s;t, for the greate&s;t part, by Worce&s;ter&s;hire; and on the north-we&s;t by Stafford&s;hire. From north to &s;outh it is near forty miles in length, about thirty in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about one hundred and thirty in circumference; in which &s;pace it con|tains &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and acres, five hundreds, one hundred and fifty-eight pari&s;hes, &s;eventeen market towns, and one hundred and fifty-five thou&s;and inhabitants. It is partly in the dioce&s;e of Worce&s;ter, and partly in that of Litch|field and Coventry, and &s;ends eight members to parliament, two for the county, and two for each of the following towns, Coventry, Warwick, and Tamworth. The la&s;t, tho' a part of it is in Staf|ford&s;hire, we &s;hall de&s;cribe in this.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>This county being divided into two parts, called the Felden and Woodland, the latter was former|ly over-run with wood, and con&s;equently un|healthy; but the wood having been &s;ince almo&s;t all cut down for the iron works in the neighbour|ing counties, both parts are now equally healthy. In former times the Felden was mo&s;tly corn land, with very little pa&s;ture; but now the ca&s;e is much altered, for the greater part of the Woodland now
<PB N="469" REF="4820">
produces corn, and the Felden pa&s;ture. The air of both is exceeding good, and the &s;oil rich; that of the Woodland having been greatly im|proved by marle and other manure. As it is, more|over, an inland county, and at a great di&s;tance from the &s;ea, well cultivated, and well watered by a great many brooks and rivers, the air can|not po&s;&s;ibly be bad. The commodities and pro|duce of the county are chiefly corn, malt, wood, wool, iron, coal, and excellent chee&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Its chief rivers are the Avon and the Tame, into both of which a great many le&s;&s;er &s;treams fal|ling, &s;erve at the &s;ame time to embelli&s;h the coun|ty, and fertilize the &s;oil. Into the Avon, on the &s;outh &s;ide, fall the Leam, the Jeken, and the Stour; and on the north, the Swift, the Sher|burn, the Holbroke, the Arrow, and Aln. Se|veral &s;maller currents al&s;o lo&s;e them&s;elves in the Tame, of which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are the Anker and the Blythe. Be&s;ides rivers, this county has &s;alt &s;prings and mineral waters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>In our de&s;cription of the towns we &s;hall begin with Coventry, as it is a city, and, together with Litchfield, the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, denominated of Litchfield and Coventry.</P>
<P>Coventry is an antient place, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from a convent, formerly &s;itu|ated here. Hither Robert de Lim&s;ey, bi&s;hop of Litchfield and Che&s;ter, removed his &s;ee, tempted, as it is &s;aid, by the wealth of the convent: how|ever, the &s;ee returned, in a &s;hort time, to Litch|field
<PB N="470" REF="4830">
again, with this condition however, that the bi&s;hop &s;hould be &s;tiled of Litchfield and Coventry. Leofric, earl of Mercia, who rebuilt the religious hou&s;e after it had been de&s;troyed by the Danes, and was lord of the place about the year 1040, is &s;aid, upon &s;ome provocation from the citizens, to have loaded them with heavy taxes. Being impor|tuned by his lady Godiva to remit them, he con|&s;ented, upon condition that &s;he would ride naked thro' the town, which he little imagined &s;he would ever con&s;ent to: but he found him&s;elf mi&s;taken, for &s;he accepted the offer, and rode thro' the town, with her long hair &s;cattered all over her body, having fir&s;t enjoined the citizens not to venture, upon pain of death, to look out while &s;he pa&s;&s;ed. It is &s;aid, however, that a certain taylor could not help peeping, and to this day there is an effigy of him at the window whence he looked. To commemorate this extraordinary tran&s;action, and out of re&s;pect to the memory of their patrone&s;s, the citizens make a proce&s;&s;ion every year with the figure of a naked woman on hor&s;eback. After Leofric's death, the earls of Che&s;ter became lords of the city, and granted it many privileges. At length it was annexed to the earldom of Cornwall, and growing con&s;idera|ble, had divers immunities and privileges conferred upon it by &s;everal kings, particularly that of a mayor and two bailiffs by Edward III. and Henry VI. made it, in conjunction with &s;ome other towns and villages, a di&s;tinct county, independent of the county of Warwick; but afterwards Edward IV. for their di&s;loyalty, deprived them of their liberties, which were not re&s;tored, until they had paid a fine of five hundred marks. By a charter from James I. an alderman is allotted to each ward, with the powers of ju&s;tices of the peace
<PB N="471" REF="4840">
within the city and its liberties. The walls were ordered to be demoli&s;hed at the re&s;toration, and now nothing remains of them but the gates, which are very lofty. It is noted for two parlia|ments held in it, the one called the parliament of Dunces, and the other of Devils; the former in the reign of Henry IV. and the other in that of Henry VI. It was on account of the exclu&s;ion of the lawyers that the former was denominated of the Dunces; and the attainders of the duke of York, and the earls of Sali&s;bury, Warwick, and March, procured the other the epithet of Devils. By a legacy of Sir William Hollis, lord mayor of London, in the reign of Henry VIII. a &s;tately cro&s;s was erected in the market-place, and adorn|ed with the &s;tatues of mo&s;t of the kings of Eng|land. The churches of St. Michael and Trinity are magnificent antient &s;tructures: the former, in particular, has a very lofty &s;pire, all of &s;tone, and &s;aid to have been twenty years and more in build|ing. The town-hou&s;e is much admired for its painted windows, repre&s;enting &s;everal kings, and others, that have been benefectors to the city. It has be&s;ides the magi&s;trates already mentioned, a recorder, &s;teward, coroner, two chamberlains, and two wardens. The chief manufactures of the city are tammies and ribbands. It reaped great benefit formerly from being the only market town of the county. It has a free &s;chool, with a library, and an ho&s;pital well endowed. The titles of vi&s;|count Deerhur&s;t, and earl of Coventry, were con|ferred by king William III. on Thomas, lord Co|ventry, of Alle&s;borough, in who&s;e family they &s;till continue.</P>
<P>Warwick. From this town the county derives its name; it is very antient, and &s;uppo&s;ed by
<PB N="472" REF="4850">
Cambden to be the place called by the Romans Prae&s;idium, where the Dalmatian hor&s;e were po&s;ted It &s;tands on a rock of free-&s;tone, of which all the public edifices in the town are built. At the Norman inva&s;ion it was a con&s;iderable place; and had many burge&s;&s;es, of whom twelve were obliged by their tenure to accompany the king in his wars. The ca&s;tle was antiently very &s;trong, both by nature and art, and is now a mo&s;t noble and delightful dwelling; the rock on which it &s;tands being forty feet above the river, but, on the north &s;ide, level with the town. In Septem|ber 1694, the city &s;uffered much by a fire, occa|&s;ioned by a &s;park blown from a &s;tick, as it was carrying cro&s;s a lane; but by an act of parliament for rebuilding it, and the liberal contributions of the nation, it hath ri&s;en again out of its a&s;hes more magnificent than it was before. It is &s;upplied with water brought in pipes from &s;prings half a mile from the town, be&s;ides what it derives from the wells within it made in the rock; and it is ea&s;ily kept clean, by being &s;ituated upon a declivity. Four &s;treets, from the four cardinal points of the compa&s;s, meet in the centre of the town. The country all around is very beautiful, of which, from a terrace in the ca&s;tle, now the &s;eat of earl Brook and Warwick, there is a very noble pro&s;pect. The principal public buildings are St. Mary's, a very &s;tately edifice, an ho&s;pital, a town-hou&s;e of free-&s;tone, three charity &s;chools, and a noble bridge over the Avon. It has had &s;everal charters; but is governed at pre&s;ent by a mayor, twelve brethren, twenty-four burge&s;&s;es, &amp;c. It is a very hand&s;ome populous town, and gives title of earl to the family of the Grevilles.</P>
<P>Tamworth, as we ob&s;erved before, is part in
<PB N="473" REF="4860">
this county, and part in Stafford&s;hire, being di|vided by the river Tame. It was antiently the &s;eat of the Mercian kings, and was afterwards de|&s;troyed by the Danes, but rebuilt by queen Ethel|fleda. It had antiently a ca&s;tle, now the &s;eat of earl Ferrers. It is noted for its ale, and has a manufacture of narrow cloth, be&s;ides &s;ome others. There is a church on the Stafford&s;hire &s;ide of the river, which is a large building, and a free &s;chool founded by queen Elizabeth. Mr. Guy, the fa|mous book&s;eller, among his other charities, left one to this town. It is governed by a bailiff, a high-&s;teward, an under-&s;teward, recorder, and other officers.</P>
<P>Birmingham, noted for its hard wares, is a large populous town, and &s;tands partly on the &s;ide of a hill, and partly at the bottom. The manufacture of hard wares is the only bu&s;ine&s;s of the place, and employs a great number of hands. The&s;e wares they have brought to &s;uch perfection, by their application and ingenuity, that they are in great reque&s;t both at home and abroad. In con&s;equence of the&s;e manufactures, the town is in a very flouri&s;hing condition, and both its public and private buildings increa&s;e very fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Aulce&s;ter is a very antient town. A great many Roman coins have been found here; particularly, not many years &s;ince, in digging the foundation of a cellar, an urn full of gold and &s;ilver Roman coins was di&s;covered, which was claimed by earl Brook, as lord of the manor. On this account, and from the Roman way, called Ickenild-&s;treet, pa&s;&s;ing thro' it, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a Ro|man &s;tation. After the conque&s;t, there was a royal man&s;ion here, in which &s;ome of our kings have re&s;ided.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="4870">
Stratford is a hand&s;ome town and corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder, high-&s;teward, and twelve aldermen, of whom two are ju&s;tices, and twelve capital burge&s;&s;es. Here is a fine bridge over the Avon, built by Hugh Clopton, &s;ome|time lord mayor of London, and a grammar &s;chool and alms-hou&s;e endowed by Edward VI. with lands formerly belonging to the fraternity of the holy cro&s;s. In the north i&s;le of Trinity church, all that was mortal of that great dramatic poet, Shake&s;peare, was interred, in the year 1564. By the river Avon, the city of Bri&s;tol carries on a very lucrative trade with this town and county, bringing great quantities of goods of &s;everal &s;orts into it, and carrying back a va&s;t deal of corn and chee&s;e.</P>
<P>Kyneton has a noted market for black cattle; and here king John is &s;aid to have kept his court &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Edge Hill is famous for the battle fought there between king Charles I. and the parliament, Sep|tember 9, 1642. Near it is a valley called the vale of Red-hor&s;e, from the colour of the &s;oil, and the figure of a hor&s;e cut out of the &s;ide of the hill by the country people, which &s;ome freeholders in the neighbourhood are obliged, by their tenure, to keep up.</P>
<P>Nuneaton is a pretty good town. It was at fir&s;t called Eaton, that is, a town upon a river, for it &s;tands upon the river Anker, and afterwards Nuneaton, from a nunnery founded in it by Robert Bo&s;&s;u, earl of Leice&s;ter. There is a free &s;chool in it, and a manufacture of woollen cloth.</P>
<P>Atherton on the Stour is a con&s;iderable town, and had formerly a mona&s;tery, but now is be&s;t
<PB N="475" REF="4880">
known by its fair, which is the greate&s;t in Eng|land for cheefe.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>At Shugbury the &s;tones called a&s;troites are found.</P>
<P>Wormleighton is noted for the richne&s;s of its &s;heep-pa&s;tures. In the reign of James I. it gave title of baron to the Spencers, afterwards earls of Sunderland.</P>
<P>Leamington has it name from the little river Leame that runs by it. Here is a &s;alt &s;pring, which is u&s;ed by the poor for &s;ea&s;oning their bread.</P>
<P>At Newenham Regis, near the river Swift, are three &s;prings, which have the ta&s;te and colour of milk. They are reckoned good for the &s;tone, be|ing exceeding diuretic, and for clo&s;ing and heal|ing green wounds.</P>
<P>Guy's-cliff, near Warwick, is the place where, as fame tells us, Guy of Warwick, the celebrated hero, after he had fini&s;hed his martial atchievements, lead a hermit's life, and was at la&s;t buried: but others, with more probability, think that it took its name from Guy de Beauchamp, who lived much later.</P>
<P>Barford, near Warwick. Here one Samuel Fairfax, born in 1647, is &s;aid to have lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e with his father and mother, grand|father and grandmother, great grandfather and great grandmother; and none of the three generations of either &s;ex had been twice mar|ried.</P>
<P>Kenelworth was antiently a very &s;trong, large, and beautiful ca&s;tle, in the centre of the county. Balls
<PB N="476" REF="4890">
of &s;tone are often found here, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been thrown from &s;lings in the barons wars; and here Edward II. was kept &s;ome time a pri&s;oner. Queen Elizabeth gave it to Robert Dudley, earl of Leice&s;ter, who laid out &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds in embelli&s;hing it, and entertained the queen, and her whole court, &s;eventeen days in it.</P>
<P>Upon Watling-&s;treet, not far from Nuneaton, is Mance&s;ter, &s;uppo&s;ed by Cambden to be the Mandue&s;&s;edum of Antoninus.</P>
<P>At Dove bridge, near Rugby, there was an|tiently a Roman &s;tation.</P>
