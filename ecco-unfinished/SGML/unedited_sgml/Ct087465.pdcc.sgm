<HEAD>TO THE Very EXCELLENT and REVEREND Me&s;&s;. G. W. J. W. W. R. and M. M.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are no per&s;ons in <HI>Bri|tain</HI> &s;o worthy of a dedica|tion of a work of this kind as your|&s;elves. Some of you have preached for many years to the members of the congregation that the&s;e &s;ermons are de&s;igned for;&mdash;and all of you, as far as your influence can reach, wi&s;h well to a&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If I have offended your excellen|cies by encroaching upon your em|ployment, it is fit I &s;hould beg your pardon, or make &s;ome apology.&mdash;
<PB N="ii" REF="6">But as I once heard one of your|&s;elves &s;ay, in a &s;ermon, that there were plenty of work for you, and many more in that way, I hope you will not be offended at receiv|ing a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from one who means well to your congregations.&mdash; Hoping you will recommend the&s;e &s;ermons to your numerous acquain|tances and friends.</P>

<PB REF="7">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is u&s;ual for preachers when they pub|li&s;h &s;ermons to a&s;&s;ign rea&s;ons why they do &s;o.&mdash;The de&s;ire of friends,&mdash;and the re|que&s;t of better judges, are often given for rea&s;ons of publication. The author of the&s;e &s;ermons does not pretend to any of the&s;e rea|&s;ons; yet he conceives he has &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons for printing his &s;ermons.&mdash;The audience to whom he intends to be u&s;eful, is far too large for any human voice to extend to them all;&mdash;and as he could not &s;peak to them all, &s;o as to <HI>make them hear,</HI> he made choice of this method to communicate his Thoughts.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on is di&s;po&s;ed to preach a &s;er|mon or two for the edification of any of God's creatures, he is under great difficulties to find a proper &s;ubject to di&s;cour&s;e upon. Almo&s;t e|very character has been de&s;cribed in &s;ome &s;er|mon or lecture.&mdash;And there is not a power of the mind, nor a member of the body, but has been preached and lectured thread-bare. &mdash;There are new &s;ermons to young men, and
<PB N="iv" REF="8">&s;ermons to young Women, lectures on heads, and lectures on hearts. Almo&s;t every &s;ubject is exhau&s;ted and &s;ermonized to death.</P>
<P>The author does not remember to have &s;een any &s;ermons upon the &s;ubject he has made choice of, nor heard any preached pro|fe&s;&s;edly to his audience. The Reverend Me&s;&s;. <HI>G. W. J. W. W. R.</HI> and <HI>M. M.</HI> will perhaps be offended at the author, for interfering in their employment, and preaching to their congregations&mdash;But this much the author may &s;ay for him&s;elf, that he has not preached after their manner;&mdash;and to make them &s;ome &s;atis|faction, has given them the honour of a dedi|cation.</P>
<P>Every preacher has a right to preach as he plea&s;eth to &s;uch as are di&s;po&s;ed to hear him, and in what manner he has a mind for the ends of edification: and if he cannot be &s;o happy as to plea&s;e his audience, he &s;hould take care not to di&s;plea&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sermons to a&s;&s;es may appear &s;trange to &s;uch as have lately read &s;ermons to young women.
<PB N="v" REF="9">&mdash;But they ought to con&s;ider, that &s;omething is even due to a&s;&s;es. We read of the a&s;s-kind preaching to mankind,&mdash;and why may not men preach to a&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>Some grave per&s;ons in black will perhaps &s;ay this is an in&s;ult upon mankind, and a reflection upon gentlemen in holy orders.&mdash;The author can only &s;ay he has followed the example of the Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> who preached to a&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the preachers will cen&s;ure the&s;e &s;ermons, for want|ing &s;ome things that ought to be in them;&mdash;and likely for not wanting &s;ome things they con|tain.&mdash;But as there is no perfection in this life, the reader mu&s;t take them as they are. There &s;hould have been two volumes of them, for the &s;ake of form, as this has become the cu&s;|tomary way of publi&s;hing.&mdash;But it was thought convenient to po&s;tpone one till &s;uch time as it &s;hould appear how the fir&s;t was received. The&s;e &s;ermons &s;hould have been dedicated to the A&mdash; b&mdash;s, B&mdash;s, and their C&mdash;y, in hopes that they would have recommended them to public no|tice;&mdash;but the author was afraid of offend|ing
<PB N="vi" REF="10">their mode&s;ty with the flattery of a dedi|cation, and for that rea&s;on altered his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The author has deferred &s;etting his name to the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es till the twentieth edition, when he may perhaps find D. D. to fix to them, like other authors.</P>
<P>If the clergy or others think it improper to preach to a&s;&s;es, the author may perhaps publi&s;h &s;ermons to Doctors in Divinity, where he &s;hall have more regard to method, and the rules of compo&s;ing &s;ermons. Every preacher ought to con&s;ider the qualifications of his au|dience, and preach accordingly. Tho' there may be &s;ome things that may &s;eem a little lu|dicrous in the&s;e &s;ermons,&mdash;the reader will find al&s;o &s;ome &s;erious things de&s;erving his notice. Thus much the preacher can &s;ay for him&s;elf, that he was very well plea&s;ed when he preached them, and had not the lea&s;t ill will at any of the human race.&mdash;This is at lea&s;t a negative qualification which &s;ome preachers are not en|dowed with. Endowed with &s;aid I, they can|not be endowed with what is negative. Call it any thing you plea&s;e, for I have done.</P>

<P>I&s;&s;achar is a &s;trong A&s;s, couching down between two Burdens.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Language of the Old Te&s;|tament is peculiarly &s;uited for drawing characters in few words. It is u&s;ual in the Hebrew lan|guage, to draw the image of a multi|tude in a &s;ingle character. We find it very u&s;ual by the figure of a bea&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="12">to point out the image of a people;&mdash; and there is always &s;ome re&s;emblance between the &s;ign and the thing &s;igni|fied. It is needle&s;s to go far for ex|amples, &mdash;there is one in the text,&mdash; <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> is a &s;trong a&s;s, &amp;c. Truly he had much need of &s;trength, for he has two burdens.</P>
<P>The tribe of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> were an in|active, &s;lothful, and &s;luggi&s;h people:&mdash; they loved re&s;t more than liberty, and cho&s;e to be &s;laves, rather than exert them&s;elves, and a&s;&s;ert their privileges. There was a rea&s;on for it,&mdash;he &s;aw that the land was good, and re&s;t plea|&s;ant for him;&mdash;agreeable to his &s;loth|ful and &s;luggi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition. Self-intere&s;t prevailed more with him than public welfare and national happine&s;s. There are many &s;uch a&s;&s;es as <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> that prefer pre&s;ent ea&s;e and advantage to
<PB N="3" REF="13">public liberty and national freedom. Our text is a prophecy in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e, which is u&s;ual in Hebrew writings. Ja|cob in his la&s;t words foretels the cha|cacter of the tribe of <HI>I&s;&s;achar.</HI> I need not tell my readers any more concern|ing the object of this prediction, than that it re&s;pected a whole tribe of the children of I&s;rael. It was too well ve|rified in their after behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob,</HI> I think, is the fir&s;t mentioned in &s;cripture that preached to a&s;&s;es, but many have been thus employed &s;ince his time. This is a &s;hameful mono&s;yl|lable, when applied to rea&s;onable crea|tures.&mdash;Men endowed with rea&s;on and under&s;tanding to degenerate &s;o ba&s;ely. What a falling off is here? <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> was a pretty numerous tribe, fifty-four thou&s;and and four hundred;&mdash;far too many to be &s;o mean &s;pirited. They
<PB N="4" REF="14">wanted not &s;trength, but &s;pirit: many good gifts are ill be&s;towed. Strength without activity but deba&s;es human na|ture. A nation of &s;laves is a kingdom of a&s;&s;es. It is di&s;honourable re&s;t and di&s;graceful plea&s;ure that is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the ruin of common weal. Re&s;t is good, but liberty is better. What. was I &s;aying?&mdash;Re&s;t without liberty is bondage and &s;lavery.</P>
<P>What can the&s;e burdens mean that <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> couched down &s;o decently un|der? They were perhaps civil and re|ligious &s;lavery. Strange! that &s;uch a number of rational creatures &s;hould &s;o tamely bear &s;uch two in&s;upportable bur|dens.&mdash;I had almo&s;t forgot that they were a&s;&s;es:&mdash;no people of any &s;pirit could endure &s;uch grievous bondage without complaining. But who need wonder at <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI>'s mean &s;pirited con|dition?
<PB N="5" REF="15">All Europe,&mdash;yea the greate&s;t part of the world have couched down between the&s;e two burdens of civil and religious oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Jews in the days of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were become a &s;ort of tame a&s;&s;es;&mdash;they couched down till the Prie&s;ts laid on their burden on the one &s;ide, and the Romans laid on their's on the other. This is at be&s;t a &s;lovenly character: I wi&s;h it were gone out of the world. In &s;cripture an a&s;s is contra&s;ted with a hor&s;e, which is a generous animal;&mdash; It is tractable, but not abject. Obedi|ence to ju&s;t laws, and &s;ubjection to &s;la|very are two very different things: the fir&s;t characteri&s;es a people wi&s;e and good, the latter ba&s;e, mean &s;pirited and &s;er|vile.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="16">
<P>It is under&s;tanding that makes men good &s;ubjects, but ignorance makes them &s;laves. If men through ignorance de|generate to a&s;&s;es, they will always find &s;ome ready to &s;ix a burden upon them. Perhaps I &s;hall give offence by repeat|ing this di&s;agreeable epithet: I &s;hall lay it a&s;ide, and in&s;tead of the &s;ign pur|&s;ue the thing &s;ignified.</P>
<P>The original word &s;ignifies an a&s;s of bone, which denotes &s;trength, but im|plies leanne&s;s. Truly all &s;laves are ge|nerally &s;peaking lean;&mdash;all who have not the enjoyment of liberty are poor, both in a political and moral &s;en&s;e. There is not a word of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI>'s mo|tion in the text: he &s;eems to have been &s;trong, but not &s;wift; &mdash; like all people under &s;lavery, not &s;it for bu&s;i|ne&s;s. He loved re&s;t and ea&s;e, and could
<PB N="7" REF="17">not be rich. It is the hand of the diligent, not the &s;trong, that maketh rich.&mdash;There is never a bri&s;k trade but among a free people; for altho' &s;laves may be able to work for riches, yet they know not how to u&s;e them. Wealth does not con&s;i&s;t in Specie, but a right circulation: &s;laves are indiffe|rent how it is. They have not a true &s;en&s;e of property, nor ju&s;t notions of right, and therefore want the &s;prings of action, which only can keep rea&s;ona|ble creatures in true motion.</P>
<P>It is wonderful what cu&s;tom will do. It is called a &s;econd nature, and ju&s;tly: through long u&s;e and habit men will &s;toop to take on their own burdens. <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> &s;tooped down,&mdash; well did he de&s;erve a heavy burden for his mean|ne&s;s of &s;pirit. It is &s;oon enough to &s;ubmit to bondage when we cannot help
<PB N="8" REF="18">it. Slavery is a ju&s;t reward to &s;uch as voluntarily give up their natural rights and privileges: &s;uch as do not value freedom and liberty de&s;erve to be &s;laves. It is finding fault with the conduct of the Almighty to give up his prero|gative to his creatures.&mdash;Such as volun|tarily give up their rights and privi|leges given them by their maker, and &s;ubmit to any human yoke, are next to athei&s;ts. Men are not at liberty to give up their tru&s;t till providence re|quire it. Our fir&s;t parents ruined them|&s;elves by &s;ubmitting to a new ma&s;ter. When men are conquered, and forced to &s;ubmit, it is no crime, but a call of providence; but when for private in|tere&s;t they give up the public wel|fare, they &s;hew them&s;elves unworthy of the protection of heaven, by reject|ing its government.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="19">
<P>Time was when there were many of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI>'s character in the&s;e our native lands.&mdash;But thanks to heaven that ge|neration is well nigh dead. About a century ago va&s;t numbers of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects were couching down between two burdens of civil and religious op|pre&s;&s;ion. The far greate&s;t part of the inhabitants of Britain were loaden, and pre&s;t down with the&s;e two heavy bur|dens.</P>
<P>It is amazing to think how creatures of the &s;ame frame and con&s;titution, en|dowed with the &s;ame powers and capa|cities, &s;hould become &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively the &s;laves of others. We are all naturally free, our &s;phere in &s;ociety may require &s;ubordination of individuals, but cannot oblige men to part with their natural rights; obedience mu&s;t be an act of
<PB N="10" REF="20">the will. In a land of &s;lavery, where Princes are arbitrary, and Kings have ab&s;olute power, there is but one public will in a whole nation, &mdash; at lea&s;t it is a mere chance if many agree with the legi&s;lator. The prince is mightily de|ceived if he thinks the &s;ubjects obey him, for there is no true obedience, but what proceeds from the heart. <HI>I&s;|&s;achar</HI>'s burden is hinted at in the fol|following ver&s;e; <HI>He became a &s;ervant to tribute.</HI> He was made a &s;ubject to civil oppre&s;&s;ion. It did not happen all at once. The mind will remon&s;trate again&s;t bondage till the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ooth her a&s;leep; it is a work of time to make men perfect &s;laves, and it is or|dinarily &s;ome leading pa&s;&s;ion, or two, that make them &s;o. Love of ea&s;e and love of plea&s;ure have brought many thou&s;ands into &s;lavery.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="21">
<P>When all the pa&s;&s;ions are engaged in pur&s;uing their various and proper ob|jects, according as nature directs and requires, it will be a miracle if men do not jo&s;tle them&s;elves clear of their bur|dens. Nations that do not look far|ther than their own boundaries, and their original di&s;trict, will in time turn &s;laves.&mdash;And &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould go abroad, to pur&s;ue trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s it be with a de&s;ign to bring &s;ome|thing home, they will remain the &s;ame people. There have been many that have made emigrations yet have carried &s;lavery along with them. Tho&s;e who look abroad for trade, to bring home riches to their native country, will mo&s;t likely pur&s;ue the ends of the true liberty.&mdash; They go not to other countries to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands, but to bring home their riches by fair trade and bu|&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="12" REF="22">Such as have a &s;en&s;e of &s;ome property in their own country will &s;eek the welfare of it at home or abroad;&mdash; and when they by diligence and indu&s;|try make their fortunes, they will en|deavour to bring it home to add to the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e two burdens, civil and reli|gious oppre&s;&s;ion, hold all nations in bondage where they prevail;&mdash;the&s;e are laid on by the power of Princes, and the power of Prie&s;ts. In &s;ome nations the Prince and the Clergy act in con|cert to fix the burden upon the peo|ple: &s;lavery there &s;eems one connected load of bondage. <HI>Mahumedi&s;m</HI> &s;eems a burden of this &s;ort. Religion among the <HI>Mahumedans</HI> is an engine of &s;tate policy.&mdash;However, this burden &s;eems to be compounded of two parts; idolatry, and civil oppre&s;&s;ion: no man can &s;ay he has
<PB N="13" REF="23">any property. In Popi&s;h countries the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame; there is only this difference, the Magi&s;trate lays on the one burden, and the Prie&s;ts lay on the other, and they may properly be &s;aid to be two, becau&s;e they re|&s;pect two different policies;&mdash;the Ma|gi&s;trate has al&s;o a burden laid upon him by the Prie&s;ts by church authority.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the King &s;hould not be <HI>&s;o tractable as they would require,</HI> they were wont to have a method to <HI>make</HI> him bear his burden patiently. They u&s;ed him as <HI>Balaam</HI> did his a&s;s; bela|boured him with church cen&s;ures, and threatened him with deprivation. But of later times Princes have become &s;o ob&s;tinate, that they have brui&s;ed the Pope's foot again&s;t the wall, and al|mo&s;t kicked him off; for he had al|ways the a&s;&s;urance when he laid on a
<PB N="14" REF="24">burden to get upon the top of it.&mdash; Soon may all the Kings of Europe &s;ee their own intere&s;t, and totally reject his authority. The common people are notwith&s;tanding &s;till oppre&s;&s;ed with two burdens. The Prince lays upon them a burden of taxes at his plea&s;ure, and the <HI>Clergy</HI> fix another to make it bal|lance fairly.&mdash;And they are &s;o much of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI>'s character, that they volunta|rily &s;toop and take on their burdens.</P>
<P>In the burden of civil oppre&s;&s;ion is contained &s;o much as the Prince hath need of for all the purpo&s;es of his pride and ambition:&mdash;and if it be the &s;ame in all countries where arbitrary government prevails, this burden will comprehend <HI>item</HI> for all things that a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth. This was once the burden of Britain, during the unhappy reign of the Stuarts: it contained in it
<PB N="15" REF="25">&s;everal articles, &s;uch as tonnage and poundage, licence to dre&s;s meat, patent for &s;oap, cards and dice, and pins, &amp;c. This burden was fixed upon the &s;ub|jects by the royal prerogative: it was encrea&s;ed and alleviated according to his <HI>maje&s;ty's gracious plea&s;ure.</HI> This was a very grievous burden, for it extended to all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. A chri&s;|tian could not call his head his own, without paying for it, nor dur&s;t any &s;ubject &s;uffer the &s;moke of his chimney to a&s;cend towards heaven, without pay|ing a modus to the King for that pri|vilege. The King of Britain was then the <HI>prince of the power of the air,</HI> as well as King of Britain and Ireland.

There have been many great alterations &s;ince the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>England</HI> was granted, and yet it is al|lowed to be the foundation of our civil privileges, and continues unaltered.&mdash; And if it be true, what I have often heard, the con&s;titution would be de|&s;troyed if <HI>this</HI> was taken away.

<P>WELL may they pre&s;s him down, and &s;it hard upon his &s;houlders, till he learn his own intere&s;t, and throw them off. I wi&s;h, <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> thy chil|dren had all died in the fir&s;t gene|ration;
<PB N="44" REF="53">but thou ha&s;t yet a numerous offspring in the world: many are the bea&s;ts of burden even in chri&s;tian na|tions. Thy &s;ons, <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> are in the <HI>church,</HI> and in the <HI>&s;tate:</HI> from the minions of <HI>prime mini&s;ters,</HI> down to the lowe&s;t journeyman of the <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>clergy,</HI> thy <HI>offspring</HI> are &s;cattered abroad.

There is &s;carce an office in the <HI>church,</HI> or under the <HI>crown,</HI> but &s;ome of thy <HI>progeny</HI> are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof in all countries. <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>convocation,</HI> the <HI>church</HI> and the <HI>the|atre,</HI> are crouded with thy de&s;cendants: from the <HI>cathedral,</HI> down to the &s;malle&s;t <HI>diffenting congregation,</HI> &s;ome of thy &s;ons are in place.

<P>There are many burdens fixed upon us by the &s;tupidity of former genera|tions, that even the&s;e who would, cannot &s;o ea&s;ily get clear of them, in our times. Heaven grant help to &s;uch as are forced to any piece of &s;lavery again&s;t their in|clination, and &s;peedily give them deliver|ance. We live under a government where grievances will be con&s;idered, if <HI>faith|fully repre&s;ented,</HI> and it is &s;urely our own fault if we bear burdens. The burden is often <HI>heavy,</HI> and the cry <HI>loud,</HI> but proper means of redre&s;s are &s;eldom pur&s;ued. It is to be feared we are not yet prepared for deliverance, for we do not apply for it earne&s;tly,
<PB N="46" REF="55">nor make u&s;e of <HI>proper means:</HI> we groan like <HI>a&s;&s;es,</HI> but do not be&s;tir our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome grievous bur|dens that &s;everal of this free nation bear, which are very unrea&s;onable, and con&s;ider a method to have them re|moved.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a burden of <HI>taxes</HI> upon the poor, which they are not able to bear. It needs no proof, for it is &s;uf|ficiently felt, that many of the nece&s;|&s;aries of life pay very heavy duties. It may be, for any thing I know, nece&s;&s;ary for the paying of <HI>public ex|pences,</HI> that the &s;ubjects are &s;o bur|dened; but there ought certainly &s;ome regard to be had to the &s;trength of the <HI>bea&s;ts of burden.</HI> All <HI>a&s;&s;es</HI> are not equally &s;trong.&mdash;They &s;hould be bur|dened
<PB N="47" REF="56">according to their &s;trength and abilities. Meat, drink, and clothing &s;hould be made as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible; things without which we cannot live, ought to be gently taxed. The poor cannot well live with le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary food than the rich, neither can they go na|ked. There mu&s;t be &s;ome rea&s;ons why they do not enjoy the nece&s;&s;aries of life according to their needs. The very &s;hoes of their feet are taxed. They enjoy no light but what pays duty to the government. I may be mi&s;taken, for perhaps they pay for their <HI>windows</HI> and <HI>candles,</HI> but not for the light of them.&mdash;But the window, the candle, and the light are &s;o nearly related, that in many ca&s;es we cannot well &s;eparate them. But whatever may be the <HI>theory</HI> of the&s;e things, there are none but feel them in <HI>practice.</HI> There are &s;everal things which might
<PB N="48" REF="57">bear duty better than the&s;e by which the poor live. Let all the &s;uperfluities of life pay&mdash;but why oppre&s;s the poor? Even <HI>a&s;&s;es</HI> de&s;erve pity&mdash;<HI>a merciful man is merciful towards his bea&s;t.</HI> There is no rea&s;oning again&s;t power, where there is no laws to re&s;train it; but as we have laws &s;ecuring our privileges, why &s;hould any &s;ubjects be oppre&s;&s;ed? We may certainly complain with &s;afety, even &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould not immedi|ately receive redre&s;s. One would rea|dily &s;uppo&s;e that there &s;hould be &s;ome proportion between the burdens laid upon the poor, and the dearne&s;s of the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions, and the quan|tity of current &s;pecie:&mdash;one of the&s;e &s;hould certainly take place, either to have <HI>taxes le&s;&s;ened, provi&s;ions cheaper,</HI> or money more plenty. As to the <HI>theory</HI> of the&s;e matters, or how they may be balanced in the <HI>oeconomy of a
<PB N="49" REF="58">prime mini&s;ter,</HI> that is not my province to &s;ay; but I think every &s;ubject may &s;ay when he is <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> he is not <HI>free.</HI> Even when men are doing their ut|mo&s;t endeavours to &s;erve their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> it is hard they &s;hould not be able to live, when the quantity of provi&s;ions in the kingdom are far from being &s;carce. When demands are made upon the lower part of mankind for the ordinary rate of duty impo&s;ed up|on them by the <HI>government,</HI> they are obliged to pay, or be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but cannot either rai&s;e their wages, or lower the prices of provi&s;ions. If they complain, they are not heard; if they re&s;i&s;t, they are belaboured like <HI>a&s;&s;es;</HI> or if through <HI>hunger</HI> and <HI>want</HI> they &s;hould be compelled to ri&s;e up to re|lieve them&s;elves, then they mu&s;t wait the i&s;&s;ue of a trial in &s;ome <HI>court of ju&s;tice,</HI> where the con&s;equences are very
<PB N="50" REF="59">vi&s;ibly repre&s;ented in <HI>&s;ome late ca&s;es.</HI>&mdash; Merciful Lord, would any people ri&s;e in mobs to di&s;turb a peaceable nation if they could help it, who have been &s;o ready in time of war to venture their lives for its &s;afety! Nay, it is <HI>pinching hunger</HI> that is the cau&s;e of it. Some few there may be that may join in riots without a cau&s;e; but the &s;ubjects of <HI>Britain</HI> love their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> too dearly to di&s;turb their peace. Rea|&s;onable duty all good &s;ubjects will be di&s;po&s;ed to pay; but when the weight lies upon the poor, where is the <HI>rea|&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of the <HI>tax?</HI> It is no re|flection upon the King that the <HI>poor</HI> are oppre&s;&s;ed, for he does not make the laws: the &s;ubjects oppre&s;s one ano|ther.&mdash;They are like the <HI>fi&s;hes of the &s;ea,</HI> the <HI>great</HI> devour the <HI>&s;mall;</HI>&mdash;only with this difference, that we are <HI>de|voured by law.</HI></P>
<PB N="51" REF="60">
<P>I have not mentioned the names and number of that <HI>burden</HI> of <HI>taxes</HI> with which we are oppre&s;&s;ed, for they are well known. The very paper I am writing upon has not e&s;caped the <HI>ex|ci&s;e.</HI> This may perhaps be rea&s;onable; for men may live without writing, but cannot without food and raiment. In &s;everal re&s;pects the poorer &s;ort of the &s;ubjects are <HI>not free;</HI> they are obliged to <HI>couch down</HI> between <HI>two burdens:</HI> one of <HI>taxes,</HI> and another of <HI>artificial &s;carcity of provi&s;ions.</HI> We have this li|berty above tho&s;e nations where ar|bitrary power prevails, we may utter our complaints, without danger, pro|viding we make no ra&s;h attempts to ca&s;e our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But for all this <HI>burden</HI> of <HI>taxes</HI> there is &s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on; <HI>government mu&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="61">be &s;upported, the debt of the nation mu&s;t be paid off, pen&s;ioners mu&s;t be maintain|ed,</HI> and <HI>clerks dues mu&s;t be di&s;charged.</HI> All the&s;e things the <HI>valet de chambre</HI> of a <HI>mini&s;ter of &s;tate</HI> know better than I can pretend to.&mdash;But there is,</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>burden</HI> which &s;everal of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects are made to <HI>couch down</HI> under, for which I can &s;ee no rea&s;on at all.&mdash;To pay for <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>wine</HI> they never <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> to entertain peo|ple they have no concern with. This they &s;ay we are <HI>obliged</HI> to do by <HI>law,</HI> at lea&s;t they threaten us with it, if we refu&s;e to pay. If it be <HI>law,</HI> it is not <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to make per&s;ons pay for other people's <HI>provi&s;ions,</HI> when they are abundantly able to do it them&s;elves. But why pay for the <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>wine</HI> made u&s;e of at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and not al&s;o for every other month of the year? This
<PB N="53" REF="62">is perhaps for the whole.&mdash;It is far too much for tho&s;e who do not make u&s;e of it.&mdash;But they may if they will; but why may they not if they will? Is there any <HI>compul&s;ion</HI> in matters of religion, in a land of liberty?&mdash;But they are not <HI>compelled</HI> to <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink,</HI> but <HI>to pay.</HI> And where is the rea&s;on for that? If it was charity it would be due, but where is the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the demand? I am afraid it &s;a|vours of a <HI>law</HI> that was excogitated at <HI>Rome</HI> many hundred years ago. It is rea&s;onable that every <HI>communicant pay;</HI> but why <HI>impo&s;e</HI> upon <HI>Di&s;&s;enters?</HI>&mdash; E&s;pecially &s;uch as have no freehold. Mu&s;t every hou&s;holder pay for what he never has any benefit by? This is &s;urely &s;uch a <HI>burden</HI> as the <HI>&s;cribes</HI> and <HI>phari&s;ees</HI> laid in old times upon the common people.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="63">
<P>What law of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> is this founded upon? It &s;hould be founded &s;ome where in the New Te&s;|tament, for it relates to religion.

This is u&s;ing men like <HI>a&s;&s;es</HI> with a witne&s;s. They ill de&s;erve communion with their Saviour, that are not willing to bear the expence of the outward elements of that communion. Say that it is <HI>charity,</HI> or <HI>prove</HI> that it is <HI>&s;crip|tural,</HI> and all good chri&s;tians will pay it for <HI>con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> It is but rea|&s;onable they have &s;ome &s;atisfaction for their money. Any people that were not pa&s;t &s;hame, would blu&s;h to demand a

<P>Self-denial is an effential part of our Saviour's religion; <HI>let a man deny him|&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s and follow me;</HI> which was once under&s;tood to mean, that believers were not to be con|formed to the world, nor to &s;eek great things for <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> But it has been found &s;ince to &s;ignify the <HI>contracy;</HI> that it is the highe&s;t degree of &s;elf|denial to enjoy a living of <HI>&s;everal thou|&s;ands a year,</HI> and do no <HI>mi&s;chief</HI> with it; that there is more mortification in rich well <HI>furni&s;hed tables,</HI> when a man is able to afford them, than in <HI>modera|tion, temperance,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;tinence;</HI> that it is a better evidence of a true chri&s;tian to behave well in the mid&s;t of <HI>riches</HI> than in <HI>poverty.</HI>&mdash;It will be owned that

<P>We can find authentic accounts of two parties near <HI>Dunbar,</HI> in the time of the <HI>u&s;urpation,</HI> ready to &s;hed one another's blood <HI>in the name of the Lord,</HI> &mdash;and both confidently a&s;&s;ured of &s;uc|ce&s;s, by their <HI>prophets</HI> that con&s;ulted their <HI>oracles.</HI> Could it be the God of heaven that <HI>the&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> con&s;ulted, and from whom they affirmed they had received a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s? If &s;o, they mu&s;t either have mi&s;taken his meaning, or he deceived &s;ome of them. I am afraid the prophets were like <HI>Ba|laam</HI>

<P>There &s;eems to be one rea&s;on why wicked men in the time of difficulty &s;eek the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome <HI>invi&s;ible Deity:</HI>&mdash;they chu&s;e not to have it thought that they depend upon any <HI>vi&s;ible agent.</HI> All men in the time of pro&s;perity affect a &s;ort of <HI>independence,</HI> and would be <HI>Deities if they could.</HI> When di&s;tre&s;s comes upon them, they are &s;timulated by pride, not to acknow|ledge their dependance upon &s;uch as they have accounted their inferiors:&mdash; they betake them&s;elves therefore to &s;ome <HI>invi&s;ible Divinity,</HI> which their con|&s;ciences tell them <HI>&s;ome-where exi&s;teth,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="133">but which they have neglected to ac|knowledge till di&s;tre&s;s urged them to it.

<P>Thus wicked men change <HI>athei&s;m</HI> for <HI>hypocri&s;y:</HI>&mdash;for when they find them&s;elves under &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity to ac|knowledge a <HI>Deity,</HI> they at the &s;ame time incline to monopolize his favour, and pretend they are <HI>his greate&s;t in|timates:</HI>&mdash;when at the &s;ame time they rather make u&s;e of the&s;e pretences to &s;erve their own ends and purpo&s;es,
<PB N="126" REF="134">than &s;incerely behave as the <HI>friends of God.</HI></P>
<P>When men are obliged to renounce any degree of their own <HI>independence,</HI> they would willingly do it with as much regard to their <HI>notions of dignity</HI> as they could,&mdash;and it is for this rea&s;on when they are di&s;po&s;ed to depend upon the <HI>Almighty,</HI> that they always incline to make the world believe that <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>them are very familiar:</HI>&mdash;that though they dare not con&s;ider them&s;elves his &s;uperior, yet they would willingly be <HI>as near equal to him</HI> as they po&s;&s;ibly could. Hence it is, that fal&s;e <HI>prophets</HI> and <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> of all &s;orts have always given out what influence they had with their <HI>Divinities,</HI> that one would almo&s;t con|clude, that they dur&s;t not do any thing without <HI>their good leave,</HI> nor refu&s;e any
<PB N="127" REF="135">thing <HI>they had a mind to ask.</HI> Such an opinion as this <HI>Balak</HI> &s;eems to have had of the <HI>fal&s;e prophet Balaam:</HI>&mdash; for, &s;ays he, <HI>whom thou ble&s;&s;e&s;t is ble&s;|&s;ed; and whom thou cur&s;e&s;t is cur&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>prophet</HI> affected <HI>Divinity</HI> as as long as he could,&mdash;till the <HI>Al|mighty</HI> made him under&s;tand that his divinations were under his controul, and then he was obliged to confe&s;s that he <HI>could do nothing beyond the command|ment of the Lord.</HI> Mankind in general make as great a &s;ecret of their <HI>depen|dance</HI> upon God as they po&s;&s;ibly can, and in the capital points of their <HI>de|pendance,</HI> pretend that none knows it <HI>but God and them&s;elves.</HI> This &s;eems to be the rea&s;on why &s;ome <HI>devout people</HI> do not con&s;ider intercour&s;e with God <HI>as a common privilege,</HI> but peculiar to

It &s;eems to be more the di&s;|po&s;ition of mankind to be <HI>Divinities,</HI> than to &s;eek after intercour&s;e with God.

<P>It will be found, upon &s;trict enquiry into the human heart, that the &s;ame ambition that excited our <HI>fir&s;t parents</HI> to &s;eek to be as Gods, makes all <HI>their po&s;terity,</HI> while they are not governed by the influence of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> to af|fect the &s;ame thing. When the mind is once perverted, no man will &s;eek to be virtuous <HI>of his own accord:</HI>&mdash;and unle&s;s he be per&s;uaded by <HI>arguments</HI> that are more powerful than his pre|judices, he will continue in the &s;ame condition into which he was &s;educed.</P>
<P>I was ob&s;erving, that the human mind is &s;ome way or other formed for <HI>re|ligion.</HI>&mdash;This is evident upon occa&s;ions; which &s;hews, that whatever perver&s;ity

<P>There is nothing more unnatural than <HI>athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>infidelity:</HI> for both <HI>the works and word of God</HI> do teach us, that <HI>dependance</HI> upon the <HI>Almighty is the language of nature.</HI> Till the mind be rightly informed, &s;he is in|capable of forming <HI>right moral prin|ciples,</HI> and without the benefit of re|velation will either fall into <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI> or <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> if not into <HI>infidelity:</HI>&mdash; but this is a perver&s;ion of nature, and not the original de&s;ign of the mind. When men &s;o far depart from the fir&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="139">principles of nature as to affect <HI>inde|pendency,</HI> the rea&s;on is, they are <HI>cor|rupted and perverted. Danger</HI> or <HI>af|fliction</HI> will produce feelings which will &s;tagger men's notions of <HI>&s;elf-dependance,</HI> but unle&s;s they are &s;et right by <HI>di|vine revelation,</HI> they will land in <HI>&s;u|per&s;tition</HI> and <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> The rea&s;on why the heathens fell &s;o gro&s;sly into <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> was, they wanted a guide to reform their minds from that per|ver&s;ity of temper that all men are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, till <HI>revelation</HI> di&s;cover to them the errors of their hearts.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that men are at|tempting to &s;educe others, and endea|vouring to &s;upport &s;uper&s;tition, they are often in&s;en&s;ibly <HI>them&s;elves infected with the &s;ame di&s;temper.&mdash;Balak,</HI> who no doubt attempted to impo&s;e upon the people of <HI>Moah</HI> the fooli&s;h <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI>
