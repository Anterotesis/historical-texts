<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO THE
DISSENTERS.</HEAD>
<P>NO Man of Wi&s;dom among you will &s;ay you are
above Advice; and Charity bids us hope you
are not pa&s;t it.</P>
<P>If you reject the Coun&s;el of tho&s;e that de&s;ign
your Good, your Friends will have the Misfortune to fail
in their good De&s;ign of Serving you: But the Di&s;a&s;ter
of not being Serv'd will be your own.</P>
<P>Whoever has the general Good of <HI>Britain</HI> at Heart,
will be concern'd when they &s;ee any part of its Inhabitants
taking Mea&s;ures to de&s;troy the Publick Peace; and who|ever
is concern'd for the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and is a Friend to
their Intere&s;t, will be very &s;orry to &s;ee them under any
In&s;atuations, and would be very glad to contribute, by all
Means po&s;&s;ible, to awaken them to their own Safety, be|fore
they have made their Mi&s;chiefs irretrievable by their
own inexcu&s;able Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> in former Reigns, were repre&s;ented to
us as Enemies to the Church, of Factious and Seditious
Principles, dangerous to Government and to Monarchy,
and Enemies to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and had much Trouble given them
on tho&s;e Accounts: When it was thus with them, they ne|ver
fail'd to prote&s;t their Innocence, their Loyalty to the
Government, their Zeal for the Pre&s;ervation of the Per|&s;on
of the King, and declar'd they de&s;ired nothing but the
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Liberty of their Con&s;ciences, and of Wor&s;hipping God
after their own Manner; and that this being granted them,
they would be fully &s;atisfied, and te&s;tify by their Beha|viour,
that all they de&s;ired of the Government was (u&s;ing
their own Words) <HI>To live peaceably and quietly under it,
in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI> They cannot rea&s;onably ex|pect
the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions of theirs, which had &s;o much In|fluence
on their new Privileges, can now be forgotten:
And it highly concerns them to behave &s;o under the Li|berty
they have obtained, as that the <HI>Church of</HI> England
&s;hould have no Rea&s;on to reproach them with the Immo|rality
of tho&s;e Prote&s;tations, or to believe that they were
not &s;incere.</P>
<P>Moderate Men, who are inclined to Peace, gave ea&s;ie
Credit to the&s;e Prote&s;tations, and were thereby moved to
acquie&s;ce at that time in the Government's giving Liberty
of Wor&s;hip to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> hoping by that means to
have the Sincerity of tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions te&s;tified by a quiet
and peaceable Behaviour: And the whole Body of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> at the time of the Revolution, wil|lingly
join'd in taking off the Edge of Penal Laws, &s;o far
as it concern'd the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> exempting them by Act of
Parliament from the Re&s;traints and Penalties which they
were &s;ubject to on account of their Religious Wor&s;hip,
and allowing them by legal Authority that Liberty of Wor|&s;hip
and Freedom of Meeting and A&s;&s;embling for the Ser|vice
of God, which they had &s;o often publickly affirmed
to be the Sum of their De&s;ires.</P>
<P>It was expected by all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> that as on the one hand they (the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>)
had received frequent and repeated A&s;&s;urances from the
Throne, of the Satisfaction their Soveraign took in having
laid &s;uch great Obligations upon them to be Faithful,
Loyal, and Zealous for the Publick Good; &s;o, on the o|ther
hand, they would expre&s;s upon all Occa&s;ions the Sen&s;e
they had upon them of the Obligation, and would con|vince
not their Sovereign only, but the Church of <HI>England</HI>
al&s;o, that the Liberty &s;o readily and from &s;uch good
Principles granted to <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> was not mi&s;placed or gi|ven
<PB N="5" REF="5">
to a People who did not know how to u&s;e it; that
they would now make good what they had always chal|lenged
to be their Character, and what they had profe&s;|&s;ed
to be their utmo&s;t De&s;ire, (viz.) <HI>To live peaceable and
quiet Lives, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To encourage them to do this, it has been the con&s;tant
Study of her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, ever &s;ince her Acce&s;&s;ion to
the Throne, to remove all the Cau&s;es of Jealou&s;y and Un|ea&s;ine&s;s
from the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as to their &s;aid Tolerations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and even to check the real De&s;igns of any who at|tempted
to put Re&s;traints upon them. And although Oc|ca&s;ional
Conformity was become too much the Practice of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> (an unju&s;tifiable thing even in the Judgment
of the mo&s;t Con&s;cientious among them&s;elves) and in pro|ce&s;s
of time grew up to &s;uch a height as to enervate the
Laws, became Scandalous to Religion, and Matter of Jea|lou&s;y
and Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Church; yet her Maje&s;ty on
&s;everal Occa&s;ions di&s;couraged the Attempts made to &s;up|pre&s;s
it, profe&s;s'd frequently from the Throne her Re&s;olu|tion
to pre&s;erve the afore&s;aid Toleration and Exemption
inviolable, and, as far as in Her lay, prevented the pa&s;|&s;ing
a Law, even again&s;t the Occa&s;ional Conformity, till
the united Voice of Her People, and even of tho&s;e whom
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> them&s;elves owned for their particular Pro|tectors,
claim'd it of Her Maje&s;ty in a Parliamentary way,
as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Publick Safety, and as a Thing
&s;o E&s;&s;ential to the National Good, as that there was not a
Voice in either Hou&s;e again&s;t it.</P>
<P>After this, it mu&s;t be very &s;urprizing if we &s;hould find
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> either fail in the Performance of tho&s;e En|gagements,
or of their Duty and Gratitude to their Sove|reign,
who has in &s;o &s;ingular a manner granted them her
Favour and Protection: It mu&s;t turn upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
extremely to their Di&s;advantage, if it &s;hall be found
that notwith&s;tanding their afore&s;aid frequent Prote&s;tations
of their Innocence, and of their being free from the afore|&s;aid
Charge of being Factious and Seditious, either by
Principle or Inclination, they now actually appear &s;iding
and joyning with an Enraged Di&s;affected Party and Fa|ction,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
who having evil and unwarrantable De&s;igns in
view, have endeavoured to en&s;nare and draw in the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
to take part with them in the mo&s;t unju&s;t
and undutiful Behaviour to their Sovereign, and to
oppo&s;e the mo&s;t ju&s;t and unexceptionable Mea&s;ures of Her
Government, on pretence of Civil Grievances, which
have no other Foundation than in the Di&s;contents of cer|tain
State&s;men, whom Her Maje&s;ty, according to Her un|di&s;puted
Right and legal Authority, has thought fit to
di&s;mi&s;s from their Employments: And, which would be
&s;till more wonderful, to &s;ee them joyn in the mo&s;t pro|voking
In&s;ults, and the mo&s;t undutiful Treatment of Her
Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, as well as of her Government, and this
with &s;uch naked and unguarded Conduct, as if they co|veted
to have it known, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> ca&s;ting off all
Duty and Re&s;pect to Her Maje&s;ty, had openly profe&s;&s;ed
a Di&s;affection to the Per&s;on and Government of their
Prince, who, on the other Hand, by all po&s;&s;ible Clemen|cy
and Beneficence had, as is above noted, endeavoured
in the highe&s;t manner to engage and oblige them.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Things are ju&s;tly laid to the Charge of the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters,</HI>
and &s;hould be proved upon them, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
lay them open to very ju&s;t Reflections. And albeit
this Letter, which is de&s;igned meekly to Admoni&s;h and
Per&s;uade them, &s;hall not accu&s;e them of the Facts; never|thele&s;s
it mu&s;t in a friendly manner acquaint them that
the&s;e Things are laid to their Charge, with &s;everal Ag|gravations,
which are not repeated here, becau&s;e the De|&s;ign
is not to burthen them with a Recapitulation of
Crimes, but rather to lead them faithfully by the Hand
to &s;uch Mea&s;ures as may conduce to their own Safety,
Honour and Peace.</P>
<P>Yet we mu&s;t not omit to let them under&s;tand, that
there is one Aggravation of their Conduct in&s;i&s;ted on by
tho&s;e who now blame them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they &s;eem to be
concern'd lea&s;t we &s;hould &s;ay they are drawn in, and un|warily
en&s;nared in their Engagements with the <HI>Faction</HI>
or Party beforementioned; but that, on the contrary,
they have made their Conjunction with them in an ex|traordinary
<PB N="7" REF="7">
manner, particularly in that they &s;ubmitted
quietly to be made a Sacrifice in their Religious Concerns
by that &s;ame Party, whom we alledge they &s;o affectio|nately
e&s;pou&s;e, rather than lo&s;e the Oportunity which
they were made to believe would thereby be put into their
Hands, to overthrow the Per&s;ons into who&s;e Hands Her
Maje&s;ty had thought fit to entru&s;t the Admini&s;tration of
the Publick Affairs: And that notwith&s;tanding they
have been actually &s;o Sacrificed by the &s;aid Party, yet
&s;uch has been the eager de&s;ire of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to pro|mote
and to &s;upport the &s;aid Oppo&s;ition to Her Maje&s;ty,
that they &s;till continue to embrace and embark with the
very Per&s;ons who &s;o Sacrificed them and their Intere&s;t as
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> Te&s;tifying thereby, that they were more zea|lous
for carrying on a Faction in the Civil Government,
than for enjoying or pre&s;erving their Religious Liberties,
which, as is &s;aid before, they had appeared &s;o much con|cern'd
about in former Times.</P>
<P>The&s;e Occa&s;ions pre&s;enting, and a Charge of &s;uch a
Nature lying again&s;t the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
it is offered in a friendly manner to advi&s;e and expo&s;tulate
with them; with re&s;pect to their pre&s;ent Conduct, and
their future Intere&s;t, that they may be prevailed with to
con&s;ider, <HI>before it be too late,</HI> what is the true State of
their Ca&s;e; and not precipitate them&s;elves and their In|nocent
Po&s;terity into that Ruin, which, if they do not
immediately alter their Behaviour, mu&s;t be inevitable to
Both.</P>
<P>Yet ere we proceed to this Expo&s;tulation, and in order
to clear the way from ju&s;t Exceptions, it is needful to ex|plain
the meaning of the words FACTION and PARTY,
as they are made u&s;e of in this <HI>Letter.</HI> The Divi&s;ion of
the People into <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> has been too long, and the
Party the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have been known to adhere to, is too
Publick to have any Charge lie again&s;t them now for be|ing
<HI>Whigs:</HI> Nor &s;hall this <HI>Letter</HI> go about to per&s;uade
them to be otherwi&s;e. <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> are not the Species
of the pre&s;ent Parties; but the Divi&s;ion lies between the
New Mini&s;try and the Old, and their re&s;pective Depen|dencies:
<PB N="8" REF="8">
And we find, that as there are many <HI>Tories</HI>
who are again&s;t the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try in &s;everal Things, as
Intere&s;ts and Pro&s;pects guide them; &s;o, many of tho&s;e
who have always di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as <HI>Whigs,</HI> and
continue to be &s;o; n$y, many <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and who &s;till
remain &s;o in their Principles, many who have always
profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves <HI>Whigs,</HI> as to Government, the
Revolution, the Succe&s;&s;ion, Liberty and Property,
and the like Things, the Heads of former Di&s;putes, are
entirely in the Intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try. For this
rea&s;on, the Oppo&s;ers of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration are
not treated as <HI>Whigs,</HI> or <HI>Tories,</HI> being compo&s;ed of Both;
but are &s;tiled throughout this <HI>Letter</HI> a FACTION, and
mo&s;t ju&s;tly &s;o, becau&s;e they apparently act contrary to the
Duty, Faith and Allegiance of Subjects, in oppo&s;ition to
the peaceable, ju&s;t and gentle Government of their So|vereign
Prince. As &s;uch then, let an impartial View be
taken of the State of Things.</P>
<P>It cannot rea&s;onably be expected that the Heat and Fury
of the Parties now contending can continue long, as it now
&s;tands. Let any rea&s;onable Per&s;on ca&s;t his Eye upon
Publick Affairs, and it will immediately occur to him,
that no Government can be &s;uppo&s;ed long to bear being
In&s;ulted and Treated as we &s;ee now practi&s;ed by the &s;aid
FACTION, in defiance of legal Authority, in contempt
of the Maje&s;ty of the Throne, and of the Ju&s;tice of the
Executive Power. For any one to tell the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
that the QUEEN, or the Government do not &s;ee, or
&s;eeing do not re&s;ent &s;uch Behaviour, would be to com|pliment
them at the expence of Her Maje&s;ty's Under|&s;tanding,
or to flatter them at the expence of their own.
It cannot then be imagined that the Government will al|ways
&s;it &s;till and &s;uffer the Indignities, the Reproaches,
and the &s;candalous Treatment which it now bears with.
The Clemency of the QUEEN, and the Forbearance
and Moderation of a Mini&s;try, are a Ble&s;&s;ing to a Nation,
when practi&s;ed in their due Mea&s;ure, but become Cri|minal
to them&s;elves, and Injurious to the Publick Safety,
when they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;o In&s;ulted, as to bring
Authority it &s;elf into Contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
The publick Embara&s;&s;ments of the War, out of which
the <HI>Faction</HI> fir&s;t hoped the Mini&s;try could never extricate
them&s;elves, and then Reproached them for having done
it, notwith&s;tanding the popular Clamour and Oppo&s;ition
made to hinder it, may have cau&s;ed the &s;aid Mini&s;try to
bear with all the le&s;&s;er Inconveniencies of our Home-Di&s;|orders:
But is it not manife&s;t that this Forbearance has
&s;o far been mi&s;improv'd at Home, as to bring things to
this <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> that now the Government mu&s;t think of Mea|&s;ures
to cru&s;h and &s;uppre&s;s Tumult and Faction; or re|&s;olve
quietly and cowardly to &s;ink under it, and fall a Sa|crifice
to a mercile&s;s, enraged Party?</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;mooth Words made
u&s;e of by their new Friends to per&s;wade them, or the Me|naces
they u&s;e again&s;t the QUEEN and Her Mini&s;ters,
cannot be &s;o weak to think that Her Maje&s;ty, and the Mi|ni&s;try
under Her, after having with a &s;urprizing Succe&s;s
gone through the fir&s;t Difficulties of this Matter, and ha|ving
brought the Publick Affairs &s;o near a happy Settle|ment,
can want Power, or are at a Lo&s;s for the proper
Mea&s;ures to &s;ubdue the Remains of a Di&s;contented Party;
a Party, who by the effectual Di&s;appointment of all their
Mea&s;ures, are dwindled and &s;unk into a di&s;concerted Rab|ble,
a meer confu&s;ed, di&s;united and di&s;per&s;ed Mob; who&s;e
Rage now is vented in reviling of Per&s;ons, and in a Fury
that merits Correction, but is not capable of giving any ju&s;t
Apprehen&s;ion to tho&s;e it is pointed again&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> cannot be &s;o weak to think that they are
able to &s;upport this <HI>Faction,</HI> and by joining with them to
do any thing but partake of their Puni&s;hment. Are the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> &s;trong enough to &s;upport a Faction again&s;t their
Sovereign! It would be the greate&s;t Injury in the World to
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> for any Man to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a Thing of them:
Becau&s;e it would of con&s;equence arm the Government a|gain&s;t
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in general, and make it nece&s;&s;ary to
fall upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> as a Body, in order thereby, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI>
to &s;atisfy the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> that the Party they are join'd with,
cannot be able to an&s;wer their Expectation, <HI>and then</HI> to
&s;atisfy the Party that the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> is not
<PB N="10" REF="10">
able to &s;upport them. If then the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> cannot pro|mi&s;e
to &s;upport this Party, why &s;hould they de&s;ire to fall
with them? Why &s;hould the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> hazard the Privi|leges,
Liberty and Safety, which they now enjoy under a
mild and ju&s;t Admini&s;tration, and run into an Adventure,
in which, if they mi&s;carry, they alone will be Lo&s;ers.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t the Hazard is not equal: The <HI>Faction</HI> are
but where they were, if their Attempts fail. Their Argu|ments
are of kin to tho&s;e of the Lepers of <HI>Samaria:</HI> As they
now are, they are Undone, outed of Places, of Employ|ments,
Di&s;graced and Di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. If they &s;ucceed in the
Attacks they make upon the Mini&s;try, they flatter them|&s;elves,
<HI>though vainly too,</HI> they may come in again: If they
mi&s;carry, they are but Undone, and can fall no lower; and
it is time enough to be quiet, when all Efforts to recover are
tried, and prove in vain.</P>
<P>But it is not thus with the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters:</HI> They enjoy
much, po&s;&s;e&s;s great Privileges, which may depend much
upon the Favour and Clemency of the Government they
live under, and which they ought not to run the Hazard of
forfeiting; nay, it would be Madne&s;s in them to run the
Hazard of forfeiting them. It is evident, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
can expect no greater Privileges or Advantages than
they now enjoy, what Party &s;oever Reigns. What have
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to do with Parties in the Government? It is
as clear as the Light, which Party &s;oever &s;ucceeds, they
can never be better in their Religious Concerns than they
are. Their Ca&s;e is the Rever&s;e of the other: The <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
are well, and had been better but for the Occa&s;io|nal
Bill, which this very Party brought upon them. If
they are quiet and &s;it &s;till, they are &s;afe, and are &s;ure to
keep what they have; if they join with tho&s;e People, they
have only this Circum&s;tance before them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That if
they &s;ucceed, they cannot be better; and if they fail, they
my be undone.</P>
<P>It is then a mo&s;t my&s;terious Folly in the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to pu&s;h
them&s;elves into this Broil. The Faction know the Force of
this Argument; and to evade it, would fain draw the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
in to &s;uppo&s;e their Civil Rights are in Danger, and to
<PB N="11" REF="11">
bring them, by a certain Thing which they mi&s;takingly
call a <HI>Publick Spirit,</HI> to hazard their Religious Liberty for
the &s;ecuring their Civil Liberty. This is a Here&s;y in Po|liticks
not heard of before, and is the Rever&s;e of all Chri|&s;tian
Duty. It has been often practi&s;ed by Chri&s;tians, and
is de&s;ervedly applauded by good Men, that all Civil Li|berties,
Properties and Privileges &s;hould be hazarded, nay
lo&s;t and relinqui&s;h'd, to pre&s;erve Religious Liberties; but
the other Part was never, as I read of, allowed by any
Chri&s;tians in the World, till the modern Chri&s;tianity of
the pre&s;ent Parties among us have recommended it.</P>
<P>The next Eva&s;ion made u&s;e of, to draw in the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
to take part in the pre&s;ent Quarrel of a Faction as a|bove,
is, That our Con&s;titution being in Danger, they
&s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, and &s;tand in a double Ca|pacity
of Intere&s;t, (<HI>viz.</HI>) as <HI>Britons</HI> on one hand, and as
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>This is &s;uch an Eva&s;ion as is u&s;ual with the Authors of
Tumult and Sedition, and is &s;omething of kin to that for|mer
Di&s;tinction of Fighting again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of the King,
but not again&s;t the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>King;</HI> and as to the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters,</HI>
is &s;omething like that Di&s;tinction which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
are &s;aid to have made in <HI>Japan,</HI> between <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and
<HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>Before the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> can di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves thus,
they mu&s;t
a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Rea&s;on, as <HI>Britons,</HI> why they &s;hould
oppo&s;e their Sovereign; not as <HI>Di&s;&s;enters:</HI> They mu&s;t
charge Her Admini&s;tration with &s;ome Illegal arbitrary
thing, and then tell us why they appear as a Body of <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
in a Ca&s;e which, if it were true, they ought to ap|pear
as <HI>Britons</HI> meerly, and in Conjunction with the Church
only, and in Defence of the Con&s;titution; not as <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
with a Party again&s;t a Government under whom the Con|&s;titution
remains entire and unbroken, and again&s;t whom
they cannot alledge the lea&s;t Breach of the Laws of Go|vernment.</P>
<P>We have not yet &s;een wherein they &s;o much as pretend
to charge the Government or the Mini&s;try with the Breach
of the Con&s;titution, with di&s;pen&s;ing Power, arbitrary Go|vernment,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
or &s;u&s;pending the Execution of the Law, except
only in delaying to puni&s;h the mo&s;t in&s;olent Treatment
that ever any Government &s;uffered in this Nation, till the
Guilty pre&s;ume upon that criminal Clemency, and haugh|tily
&s;ugge&s;t it to be the Effect of Fear.</P>
<P>We have not yet &s;een them Impeach their Prince of Ty|ranny
or arbitrary Government, or of any Breach of Her Royal Duty;
and we may adventure to &s;ay they cannot,
except the Sin of too much Mercy, which they may find a
time to repent the Abu&s;e of; and to know that though it
has gone far, yet it will have an End, and may be pro|voked
beyond the Power of longer Forbearing.</P>
<P>We have not &s;een them charge the Mini&s;try with Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing
the Bounds of their Duty, or of the Laws, except
in Generals, which is unju&s;t and unfair. Why do they not
tell the People what the Crimes are which the Admini|&s;tration
is charged with, and what the Puni&s;hments which
the Laws have made their due? What can they impeach
the Mini&s;try of? Where is the Trea&s;ure wa&s;ted, the Ta$|es
mi&s;applied, the Funds interrupted, the Families en|riched
out of the publick Spoils? Is it po&s;&s;ible that all this
Violence can be &s;hewn again&s;t the Mini&s;try, and no Im|peachment
drawn up! No Rapine, no Trea&s;on, no Mi&s;u&s;e
of Power laid to their Charge! All the Crime we yet hear
of, is, That they are Mini&s;ters of State, and that others,
who de&s;ire to be in their Places, are not &s;o: To re-obtain
which, they would rai&s;e all the Confu&s;ions in their Coun|try
that were po&s;&s;ible, and divide us into Factions and Par|ties,
as if the Safety of the Nation depended not upon the
Admini&s;tration it &s;elf, but the Persons who are employed
in it. And what have the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to do in this? Of
what e&s;&s;ential moment is it to them whom the Queen em|ploys
in the Admini&s;tration, &s;o the Per&s;ons employed guide
the State by legal Methods according to the Con&s;titution?
Is this of Concern enough to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> that they
&s;hould embroil them&s;elves with the Government about it,
and hazard all their Religious Advantages, which now
they enjoy, in the private Quarrel of a Faction? Unac|countable
Folly! What will they &s;ay to their Children af|ter
<PB N="13" REF="13">
them, if it &s;hould appear that on &s;uch Accounts as
the&s;e, and with &s;uch Views, and to carry on &s;uch De&s;igns,
they lo&s;e the Religious Liberty they enjoyed, and oblig'd
the Government to abridge and cut them &s;hort for the
mere nece&s;&s;ary Pre&s;ervation of the Publick Peace?</P>
<P>How will this for ever open the Mouths of the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
Enemies again&s;t them, and cau&s;e them to &s;ay, That
all that had been formerly &s;aid of them was True, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
of their being a turbulent unpeaceable People, Enemies to
Government, re&s;tle&s;s under Re&s;traint, that &s;ought not &s;o
much the Liberty of their Religion as a Liberty from all
Government; that, if they were tolerated in the Exerci&s;e
of their Wor&s;hip, would &s;till remain Di&s;&s;atisfied, Factious
and Unea&s;y; be ever di&s;turbing the Repo&s;e of the State,
and on all Occa&s;ions join with tho&s;e that &s;hould di&s;turb it.
What can the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have to &s;ay, to vindicate them|&s;elves
from that Calumny, unle&s;s they con&s;ider it in time,
and alter their pre&s;ent Conduct?</P>
<P>Formerly, as is &s;aid, they alledged that all was fal&s;e
which was &s;aid again&s;t them of this kind; that they de&s;i|red
only Liberty of Religion, were harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive
People, faithful to the Government, and chearfully Obe|dient
to the Laws, &s;eeking only the Ea&s;e of ther Con&s;ciences
in Matters purely Religious; that in the Affair of the Re|volution,
they only join'd with the Church in re&s;i&s;ting
Arbitrary Government, and endeavouring to maintain the
Laws and Con&s;titution, the natural Rights of Engli&s;hmen,
and the like; and there being no immediate Charge again&s;t
them to the contrary, many People gave Credit to them
in this matter: But now when the Laws are uninvaded,
the Con&s;titution entire and unbroken, no Encroachments
made on Liberty no Violence on Property, no Oppre&s;&s;ion,
no Inju&s;tice offered them, their Religious Liberties granted
them to their full Satisfaction, nay their Schools and Semi|naries
allow'd them, though by Law they may and ought
to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; for them to bandy again&s;t the Govern|ment
now! for them to abett a re&s;tle&s;s Faction, and fall in
with a Sett of Malecontents to embroil and enflame the
People now! for them to in&s;ult the Queen and the Mini|&s;try
<PB N="14" REF="14">
now! What can be &s;aid for this, but that it is the
mere E&s;&s;ence and Spirit of Sedition? And what can be the
Con&s;equence, but that it will oblige the Government to
teach them their own Intere&s;t by Methods more mortify|ing
than they otherwi&s;e intended to do, and to take from
them the Power of doing the Mi&s;chief they &s;eem to have
Will to bring to pa&s;s?</P>
<P>That the Government have Power to do this, and that
too many Ways are left to humble the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> it would
be lo&s;t time to contend about; they cannot be &s;o ignorant
as not to know it.</P>
<P>But before I come to mention that Part, it will be need|ful
to examine a little the farther Views and Pro&s;pects,
upon which the Party we &s;peak of have drawn the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
to act with them in the&s;e Tumults and Di&s;orders, and
what it is that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> can rationally propo&s;e to them|&s;elves
in the greate&s;t Succe&s;s of the Faction they are &s;iding
with. For it cannot be imagined of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> but
that, like all rea&s;onable Creatures, they propo&s;e &s;ome End
to them&s;elves in every Action before they engage in it,
much more in Actions of &s;uch Con&s;equence as taking Sides
in the <HI>Brouilleries</HI> of the State: They mu&s;t then have &s;ome
rational Views to ju&s;tify their Actions to them&s;elves, or at
lea&s;t &s;ome pretences of rational Views. Let us enquire, as
far as we have Light into them, what they are.</P>
<P>The main Pretence with which the Party have for a
long time alarm'd the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> is, the Danger of the
<HI>Pretender,</HI> and the Intere&s;t they have in the Prote&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;or. How this can have obtained &s;o far upon Men of
a peaceable Di&s;po&s;ition, as Charity bids us &s;uppo&s;e the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to be, is my&s;teriou&s;ly &s;trange, the utmo&s;t Rea|&s;on
that has yet been given for that Jealou&s;y, having been
founded on mere Sugge&s;tion, malicious Cavils, and the
bold Allegations of partial and prejudiced Men, without
any real Ground or &s;ufficient Evidence of Fact again&s;t any
one Per&s;on in the Admini&s;tration. Not one Step has been
taken, either by the Queen or Her Mini&s;ters of State, to|wards
weakning the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, or encouraging
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> unle&s;s renewing Laws to enforce the Ab|juring
<PB N="15" REF="15">
the <HI>Pretender</HI> by Name, obliging the <HI>French</HI> King
to Renounce him, and to engage on the Faith and Honour
of a King, for Him&s;elf and his Po&s;terity, never to aid, a&s;|&s;i&s;t,
or encourage him to attempt us, and in the mean time
to expel him from his Court, and from his Dominions, and
to acknowledge the Title of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> I &s;ay, unle&s;s
the&s;e are to be e&s;teemed as Grounds of Su&s;picion and
Encroachments of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>It might be enquired here, Why is the <HI>Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion</HI>
endeavoured to be made the immediate Strife? The
QUEEN (God be prai&s;ed) notwith&s;tanding a Thou&s;and
&s;candalous Reports, is in a good State of Health, and gives
no room to make any thing of the Succe&s;&s;ion our immediate
Concern, except its future Certainty, and as to the future
Security and Certainty of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, what
more can be done? The Laws have E&s;tabli&s;hed it, the
QUEEN has declared for it, the Mini&s;try have not done
the lea&s;t thing in prejudice of it; the mentioning it then
can be with no View but to keep the People alarm'd and
unea&s;ie; &s;eeing nothing can be de&s;ired, even by the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Hanover</HI> them&s;elves, to make their Succe&s;&s;ion &s;afe, more
than is already done in a Legal and Parliamentary way.</P>
<P>But the&s;e People injure the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and the
Succe&s;&s;ion it &s;elf, in their Conduct, by Threats of what
&s;hall be done to Per&s;ons and Parties, when the <HI>Hanover</HI>
Succe&s;&s;ion takes place: It were to be wi&s;hed tho&s;e who
are true Friends to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, would be
more wary in what they &s;ay and do of this kind, lea&s;t they
Ignorantly a&s;&s;i&s;t a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t by tho&s;e very Steps
which they think contribute to the E&s;tabli&s;hing the Line
of <HI>Hanover.</HI> Were the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI>
to &s;ee how they are, on the mo&s;t frivolous Occa&s;ions,
thrown in the Faces of the mo&s;t Loyal Subjects the QUEEN
has; how the afore&s;aid <HI>Faction</HI> Bullies the People with
<HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion; and threatens the Mini&s;try and all
their Friends with the Re&s;entment of the Succe&s;&s;or: They
would &s;hew their Di&s;plea&s;ure at it, and tell them plainly
that this is weakning, not &s;trengthening, their Intere&s;t, by
making them Terrible to the Nation they are to Govern;
<PB N="16" REF="16">
filling the Minds of the People with the Apprehen|&s;ions
of what Treatment they &s;hall meet with from
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> which tends to arm their Minds
with Fear of, and con&s;equently an Aver&s;ion to the Per|&s;on
of the Succe&s;&s;or, and, by the &s;ame Rule, to the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
it &s;elf. Do the&s;e People think that the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Hanover</HI> &s;o ill under&s;tand the Policy of Government, as
to come over hither prepared to Revenge the Quarrel of a
<HI>Faction?</HI> To e&s;pou&s;e Parties, and to enter into the Re|&s;entments
of a few enraged Men again&s;t the re&s;t of the
Nation, who are to be equally their Subjects, and who
will have an equal Claim to their Favour and Protection?</P>
<P>What Inconceivable Injury do the&s;e People do to the
<HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or!</HI> To endeavour to make him a
Terror to any of tho&s;e who are to be his Subjects! To
threaten us beforehand with the Re&s;entment of that Pow|er,
which it is expected we &s;hould all concur to bring in,
and give up the Government to! It al&s;o merits &s;ome
Enquiry to know who they are, which this Re&s;entment
is threatned again&s;t.</P>
<P>Are they not tho&s;e whom the QUEEN Admini&s;ters
Her&punc; Government by? Whom Her Maje&s;ty declares
worthy of Her Favour, and fit to place the Royal Au|thority
with? Would the&s;e Men per&s;uade us then, that
the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or</HI> &s;hall &s;o requite the QUEEN for
all that Concern &s;hew'd by Her Maje&s;ty to e&s;tabli&s;h the
Crown in their Family, by the Treaty of Union, and
many other ways, as to fall immediately upon the very
Per&s;ons who a&s;&s;i&s;ted Her Maje&s;ty in pre&s;erving the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the Crown to them entire? Is not this an irre|parable
Injury to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or?</HI> An Inju&s;tice
he cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of and re&s;ent? Is it not the
only way to weaken, and finally to ruine the Succe&s;&s;ion
it &s;elf; and, as above, to make the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or</HI>
the <HI>Terror,</HI> not the <HI>De&s;ire of Great Britain?</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> would do well to con|&s;ider
what they in particular have to expect from the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;or.</HI> Can they expect more than they have?
Will the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or</HI> favour them more, and do
<PB N="17" REF="17">
more for them than the QUEEN has done? Of what
&s;ort can that Favour be? Can they hope he will take
off the <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill</HI> lately brought on by their own
Treacherous Friends? Or will he attempt to remove
the TEST, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly admit them into Places,
<HI>&amp;c?</HI> If this were really their Expectation, yet it would
&s;avour of more Hone&s;ty than Di&s;cretion to &s;ay &s;o: For
it would be an irreparable Injury to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;or</HI>
to make that Expectation be received by the People;
it would be &s;uch a Handle to the <HI>Pretender</HI> to take hold
of, as nothing could be equal to it, and would alarm the
Church of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as
being dangerous to their Safety, and to the very Con&s;ti|tution
of the Church. And thus you would Injure the
Succe&s;&s;ion which you appear &s;o zealou&s;ly to e&s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>What then can it be which &s;hould embark the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
in the pre&s;ent Quarrel of Parties? In which, if they
knew or could di&s;cern their own Intere&s;t, they would at
lea&s;t be Neuters; knowing that they mu&s;t be Lo&s;ers by
taking part in the Strife, which Side &s;oever prevails;
and that they are never courted, but with a De&s;ign to be
u&s;ed like <HI>David</HI>'s Heifers, fir&s;t to draw the Cart, and
then to be burnt with the Wood of it. If then they had
a Sen&s;e not of their Obligation to their Sovereign only,
but of their own Civil and Religious Intere&s;ts, they
would from the Beginning have appeared again&s;t the&s;e
things, by which they would have prevented the
Danger of having the Government oppre&s;&s;ed by a
<HI>Faction,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Mini&s;try taking
Mea&s;ures, and u&s;ing Hands which they had no De|&s;ire
or De&s;ign to have taken or u&s;ed; from which
Mea&s;ures they never yet could &s;ee a &s;afe Door of Re|treat,
nor ever can, till the Edge of <HI>Faction</HI> and <HI>Se|dition</HI>
is more effectually taken off, and the Rage of
<HI>Parties</HI> abated.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>Di&s;&s;entenrs</HI> then ask them&s;elves what particular
Views are propo&s;ed to them at this time, for which they,
<HI>as Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> ought to meddle or embark them&s;elves with
any Party? What have the <HI>Di&s;&s;entenrs</HI> to do, <HI>as Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="18">
in the Broils about who is or is not employed in the State?
Is it not Intere&s;t of Per&s;ons, and Intere&s;t of Parties in the
publick Management that is the Quarrel? What is the
Que&s;tion to them? And moreover &s;eeing which Side &s;oe|ver
prevails, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are &s;ure to have no &s;hare in the
Management; Why &s;hould they have a &s;hare in the Hazard?</P>
<P>In embarking with the&s;e Men, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> can have
no hope but in the Succe&s;s of tho&s;e they embark with: If
that Succe&s;s comes, they are under foot &s;till, nay, <HI>the Fa|ction</HI>
dare not &s;ay they will relieve the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> if they
&s;hould obtain the Victory; they dare not promi&s;e the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
the lea&s;t Favour, or to redre&s;s the lea&s;t of their
Grievances. To &s;ay that they but intend it, would be
to tell the Church-Party that they will le&s;&s;en the Security
made by the Law for its Pre&s;ervation; and let in the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
to &s;uch a &s;hare of Power as would be dangerous to
the Church: Nay, on the contrary, does not a Noble
Lord in a late Pamphlet, &s;aid to be of his Writing, pub|lickly
recommend the pre&s;ent Di&s;contented Party as the
Church's true and only Friends, <HI>becau&s;e they have at</HI>
THIS TIME <HI>&s;et their foot upon the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>and
for ever made them &s;afe from giving the Church any Un|ea&s;ine&s;s?</HI>
Can they then who recommend them&s;elves by
your Oppre&s;&s;ion, give you hope of Recovery by their Suc|ce&s;s?
As they have now occa&s;ionally u&s;ed you, they are
Traitors to the Confidence you have placed in them; and
if they &s;hould re&s;tore you, they mu&s;t be as Treacherous to
the Church, whom they court, and to whom they at this
time plead the Merit of your De&s;truction.</P>
<P>So that neither the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, nor the Succe&s;s
or Re&s;toration of the Party you e&s;pou&s;e, can ever retrieve
your Ca&s;e. On the other Hand, if the <HI>Faction</HI> mi&s;carries,
as the Nation hopes, and hone&s;t Men pray, you have no|thing
to hope for, <HI>as Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> but what mu&s;t be founded
on the Mercy and Clemency of Her Maje&s;ty, after the
greate&s;t Prevarications you are able to be guilty of;
who tho' not inclin'd to Severity, may &s;ee Cau&s;e in
your Conduct to prevent your offering the like again,
and may teach you your Duty at the expence of that
<PB N="19" REF="19">
Liberty, which you will then mo&s;t ju&s;tly forfeit to the
Government.</P>
<P>The Sum therefore of this Part of the Advice to the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> is, That they would be &s;o Wi&s;e, and &s;o be|have
them&s;elves, as not to make it nece&s;&s;ary to the Go|vernment
to re&s;ent their Conduct, and to oblige the Ex|ecutive
Power, when they correct a Seditious Party, as
they mu&s;t quickly do, to lend the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> a La&s;h to
let them know their Duty, and make them ta&s;te what
they might ju&s;tly expect a greater &s;hare of.</P>
<P>Why al&s;o &s;hould the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> who are a great tho'
not a powerful Body in the Nation, &s;uffer them&s;elves to
be made Tools of a Party? Are they not &s;ure to be laid
by, and ca&s;t away by that very Party that u&s;e them, a&s;|&s;oon
as the Dirty Work they are employ'd in, is over;
and &s;ure to be worn out and ruin'd, if that Dirty Work
&s;hould not &s;ucceed? When will the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> learn to
be Wi&s;e to their own Peace, and not meddle with Con|tention,
which does not belong to them, which <HI>Solomon</HI>
&s;ays, <HI>is like one that takes a Wolf by the Ears?</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem, that in the&s;e things, the Intere&s;t of the

their Animo&s;ity to the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration? Why en|ter
into the Re&s;entments of a few Men, who have given
&s;o many Te&s;timonies that the want of Power to aggran|dize
them&s;elves is their only Di&s;&s;atisfaction?</P>
<P>Why &s;hould the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> covet to be ill with their
Sovereign; and why &s;ignalize their Oppo&s;ition to their

<P>Why &s;hould the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> oblige the Government to
take the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion to lay their Hands upon them,
and to &s;ingle them out as a People whom it is nece&s;&s;ary

the contrary their Safety con&s;i&s;ts in the Ruin and Over|throw
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters?</HI> And what Nece&s;&s;ity are the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in, of coming into &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, e&s;pe|cially
where the Victory is &s;o doubtful, and the Mi&s;chief
in ca&s;e of a Mi&s;carriage &s;o certain?</P>
<P>It is worthy the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> Ob&s;ervation, That how|ever
they may have been oppre&s;&s;ed for private Ends not
&s;o much concerning them&s;elves, and often perhaps with
no immediate De&s;ign to de&s;troy them; yet they have ne|ver
been courted by any Party, but with a clear and o|pen
De&s;ign to ruin and &s;uppre&s;s them. And not to go
too far back in Hi&s;tory to prove this, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> ha|ving
had the Fate not to be much courted at any time,
the fir&s;t In&s;tance we meet with of this, is recent in Me|mory;
<HI>viz.</HI> in the Time of the late King <HI>James</HI> II. His
Care&s;&s;ing the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> had in it the&s;e two remarkable
Circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, that it was known he did not begin
it, till he had fir&s;t tried all po&s;&s;ible Methods with the
Church, and twice offered to make a Sacrifice of all the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in the Kingdom to them, if they would have
come into his Mea&s;ures; when failing in his De&s;ign on
that &s;ide, and finding them &s;teady to the Con&s;titution,
he faced about to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and offered them a like
Sacrifice of the Church; hoping by gratifying their
Revenge to gain their Help in his De&s;ign of ma&s;tering
the Laws, breaking in upon the Con&s;titution, ruining the
Church and thereby the Prote&s;tant Religion, and at la&s;t
(mighty Favour!) the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> them&s;elves. Then it
was that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were awakened by an excellent
Tract under the &s;ame Title of this, (<HI>viz.) A Letter to
a Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> written by a <HI>Noble</HI> Author who was an emi|nent
Tory, though a Friend to the Con&s;titution and to
the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, (for &s;uch are con&s;i&s;tent) <HI>viz.</HI> the
late Marquis of <HI>Hallifax.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22">
How far the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were drawn into that Snare,
I would have cho&s;en to &s;ee buried in the Merit of their
After-Conduct in the Revolution, where it not that I &s;ee
them now drawn into the like Evil with &s;o much more
Art, but with a View equally fatal to them&s;elves; a Plot
again&s;t the very E&s;&s;ence of their Liberty as <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
and the more likely to &s;ucceed, becau&s;e they are brought
to that Condition as to &s;ee and know, that they are de|&s;ign'd
to be an Oblation or Peace-offering for their Party
to the Tories or High Church, whenever a Treaty of
Reconciliation &s;hall commence; and yet that they are
contented to be &s;o, and to e&s;pou&s;e <HI>the Faction</HI> at that
Price.</P>
<P>To what a &s;trange Infatuation are the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> brought!
who, although under the mild and merciful Admini&s;tra|tion
of the pre&s;ent Queen they enjoy more Liberty than
the Laws direct, and are protected from many In&s;ults
which they would be expo&s;ed to, if Her Maje&s;ty thought
fit to let them know their true Circum&s;tances; yet are
willing to appear with a Party who have made the Op|pre&s;&s;ion
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> the expre&s;s Condition of their
being re&s;tored! Was ever any Infatuation like this! What
can be &s;aid in Abatement for &s;uch Conduct, but mu&s;t re|flect
upon the very Under&s;tandings of the People we
&s;peak of, except we &s;hould, to compliment the Sen&s;es of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> give up their Morals, and declare them
bent upon Rebellion and the Ruin of their Country;
Things, which it is very difficult to bring our Charity
to &s;u&s;pect them of,</P>
<P>It &s;eems the Party who have carried the Delu&s;ions of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to &s;uch a Length, have done it by po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
them with a degree of Contempt, fir&s;t of the
Queen's Per&s;on, and then of Her Power. It is not hard
to impo&s;e upon the Judgment of a People in &s;mall Mat|ters,
when they have d$ne it in greater: When a Breach
is made upon our Duty and Affection to our Prince, it
follows that we contemn what we hate, and that we are
ea&s;y to be brought off from our Fear of that Power,
which we are prevail'd upon not to love.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
It is very &s;trange that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> &s;hould be pre|vail'd
upon in either of the&s;e, and perhaps the Fact may
be denied in their Behalf. It were &s;incerely to be
wi&s;h'd that it were not true: And &s;o tenderly &s;hall the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> be handled in that ca&s;e in this <HI>Letter,</HI> that I
&s;hall choo&s;e rather to &s;ay, it has been attempted, and
they have been pre&s;&s;ed and per&s;waded to contemn the
Re&s;entments of the Government, than that they have
been prevail'd upon actually to do &s;o.</P>
<P>But it may be as proper to u&s;e &s;ome Arguments with
them to &s;hew the Weakne&s;s of this Delu&s;ion, be the Mat|ter
of Fact one way or other, (<HI>viz.</HI>) whether they have
been prevail'd upon, or have only been per&s;waded and
attempted: In the one Ca&s;e it is needful to prevent
their Mi&s;takes; in the other to open their Eyes, and a&s;&s;i&s;t
them to retrieve it before it be to late to look back.</P>
<P>Let them reflect then, In what can their Contempt of
the pre&s;ent Power &s;erve their Intere&s;t? and upon what
can it depend?</P>
<P>The Life of Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty is the chief thing
that I have ob&s;erved the Party made u&s;e of, to habitu|ate
this Contempt among the People. I have that Cha|rity
for the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as to believe, however they may
have heard this Argument made u&s;e of, though &s;ome
of them may have been weak enough to re&s;train their
open Di&s;like of it; yet their &s;ecret Thoughts have
re&s;ented it with a ju&s;t Horror. It is not in the Con|&s;titution
of a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> as &s;uch, to entertain Thoughts
&s;o Unchri&s;tian, &s;o Unnatural; and whatever the Delu&s;i|on
may have been, no Prote&s;tant <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> can calmly
and &s;edately &s;ay, that he wi&s;hes the Death of Her pre|&s;ent
Maje&s;ty, but his Con&s;cience mu&s;t admit &s;ome Hor|ror,
and reproach him in a manner that cannot be quietly
born.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, albeit &s;ome have been drawn in to
drink that Unchri&s;tian, Bloody, and Trea&s;onable Health,
which now with an unheard of Impudence is made the
Te&s;t of the pre&s;ent Faction, (viz.) <HI>To &s;end the Hou&s;e
of</HI> Hanover <HI>&s;peedily to the Throne;</HI> neverthele&s;s, I do
<PB N="24" REF="24">
not charge it upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> as a Body, but I heartily
wi&s;h every <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> would, for their own &s;akes, and for
the Credit of Religion which they profe&s;s, or el&s;e cannot
be rightly called <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> I &s;ay, that they would make
it a particular Mark of a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> to declare their Ab|horrence
of a Thing every way &s;o Criminal, &s;eeing it is
no le&s;s than Cur&s;ing the Q&mdash;n, and drinking her Con|fu&s;ion
as a Q&mdash;n, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That &s;he would either &s;pee|dily
Dye, or &s;peedily be Depo&s;ed.</P>
<P>As the Ca&s;e now &s;tands, He cannot wi&s;h well to this
I&s;land, who does not wi&s;h the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, as
now e&s;tabli&s;hed by Parliament, may in God's due time
take place, that the next Heir of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI>
being Prote&s;tant may quietly and peaceably &s;ucceed: But
he is a Traitor to his Country, a Murderer of the
Q&mdash;n, an Enemy to the Publick Peace, and an un|grateful
Subject to an obliging merciful Prince, that can
wi&s;h even that Suce&s;&s;ion &s;hould take place, till the cour&s;e
of God's Providence has remov'd Her Maje&s;ty by the
Hand of Nature.</P>
<P>But not to mention that Time which every true Sub|ject
thinks of with Regret, and de&s;ires to place as re|mote
as po&s;&s;ible, What is the Argument for which this
horrid Spirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es us? Is it more or le&s;s than this,
That they wi&s;h the Queen were dead, only the Mini|&s;try
might be chang'd? Is not this Sedition in the Ab|stract?
Is not wi&s;hing the Q&mdash;n dead, murdering the
Q&mdash;n? Is not wi&s;hing Her Maje&s;ty Depo&s;ed, an in|tentional
Rebellion, and a Depo&s;ing the Q&mdash;n? Sup|po&s;e
this Helli&s;h Thought gratified! Heaven guard
Her Maje&s;ty from the very Sugge&s;tion! It is a kind
of Trea&s;on but to &s;uppo&s;e it! But what would this a|vail
the Party? Are they a&s;&s;ured this would an&s;wer
that part of the De&s;ign, and bring us to a Change of
Hands in the Admini&s;tration? The&s;e Men are not a|ware
of the Con&s;equence of that Sugge&s;tion! Can you
&s;erve the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI> more, than by pro|moting
a general Opinion, that when the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|over</HI>
comes in, the Succe&s;&s;or will immediately re&s;tore
<PB N="25" REF="25">
the Whigs, and turn out the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try? For
my part, I dare not entertain the Thought, for the Hor|ror
of its Con&s;equences; for either way, for ought I
&s;ee, we are to be ruin'd.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould &s;ay, the Succe&s;&s;or will employ the pre|&s;ent
Mini&s;try, we arm all the afore&s;aid Faction again&s;t
the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion: For, if they would be glad
the Q&mdash;n were dead, rather than the Old Mini&s;try
&s;hould not come in (the Truth of which they have Fol|ly
enough not to deny) with much more Charity may
we &s;uppo&s;e, they had rather the <HI>Hanover</HI> Hou&s;e &s;hould
not Succeed than that the Old Mini&s;try &s;hould not come
in; and con&s;equently they would even join the <HI>Pre|tender</HI>
to bring in the Old Mini&s;try, if there were no
other way. Nor are they for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion
it &s;elf, but on a Pre&s;umption, that when they come to
Succeed, they &s;hall immediately change Hands, and take
them into the Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if we &s;ay the Succe&s;&s;or &s;hall de|po&s;e
the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, and overthrow the
<HI>High-Church</HI> Intere&s;t, then we make nece&s;&s;ary the <HI>High-Church</HI>'s
being Enemies to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of
<HI>Hanover,</HI> and ju&s;tifie them in being &s;o from your own
Practice. It is not &s;o long &s;ince the pre&s;ent Di&s;conten|ted
People for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, (viz.) <HI>Their being out
of Place,</HI> were equally Di&s;contented at the late Mini&s;try
and made no &s;cruple to Confederate with the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s
Party here, again&s;t the very Per&s;on of the late Lord
Trea&s;urer <HI>G&mdash;n,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI>
The Truth of which needs not to be quoted from Prin|ted
Relations, &s;eeing there are Living Witne&s;&s;es &s;ufficient
to put it pa&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of being Contradicted. And
nothing brought them off from that Confederacy, but the
taking them into the Admini&s;tration, after which all the
Complaints of that Admini&s;tration cea&s;ed, they became
Advocates of the very Mi&s;management they had accu&s;ed
the Mini&s;try of, and never concerned them&s;elves to re|ctify
one of tho&s;e Things, which they had called Abu&s;es
before.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26">
Thus it is a Dilemma they cannot remove, and can
give no rational An&s;wer to, whether the Succe&s;&s;or &s;hall
change the Mini&s;try, when he comes to the Crown, or
no? <HI>If he &s;hould not,</HI> as there is very good Ground to
believe from the Prudence, Wi&s;dom and Judgment of
the Per&s;on we expect to Succeed, what &s;trange Exce&s;&s;es
and ungrounded Follies do the&s;e Men run into, who car|ry
their Heats to &s;uch a height, with a View which they
have no &s;ufficient Ground to expect &s;hall be an&s;wer'd;
although the Trea&s;onable Horrid Sugge&s;tion of the De|mi&s;e
of the Pre&s;ent QUEEN were now to happen.</P>
<P>But not to enter into the Follies of the <HI>Malecontents,</HI>
which is not the De&s;ign of this <HI>Letter,</HI> any farther than
it appears the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are engaged in them. It is the
Wi&s;h of every moderate Chri&s;tian, who aims at the pub|lick
Quiet, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> would take &s;ome Lei&s;ure
&s;eriou&s;ly to examine their own Circum&s;tances, upon what
Foundation their Liberty &s;tands, whom they forfeit for,
as well as for them&s;eves, if they provoke tho&s;e too far
who cannot want Power to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice upon
them: And above all, <HI>for what it is</HI> that they lay their
Religious Intere&s;t at Stake. Prudence requires all Wi&s;e
Men to weigh their Actions in the Ballance of Rea&s;on,
and to judge, whether there is any due Proportion be|tween
the Hazard run and the End propo&s;ed. It &s;eems
to be one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Parts of the Mi&s;eries of a
future State, that the Spirits of the Wretched &s;hall be
capable to reflect upon, and reproach them&s;elves with
the &s;ordid Trifles, for which they forfeited Eternal Hap|pine&s;s.
How mean a Thing will the e&s;pou&s;ing a Party-Broil
appear in the Eyes of your Children, when they
&s;hall compare it with the lo&s;s of an E&s;tabli&s;hed Liberty of
Con&s;cience, and &s;hall reflect that their Fathers forfeited
to the Publick Ju&s;tice the Religious Liberties they en|joy'd,
by their e&s;pou&s;ing <HI>Faction,</HI> and joyning in with a
Party again&s;t the ju&s;t Admini&s;tration of their beneficent
Sovereign; having at the &s;ame time not the lea&s;t Challenge
again&s;t the &s;aid Admini&s;tation, not one Law broken, not one
Privilege invaded, not one Act of arbitrary Power exer|ted,
<PB N="27" REF="27">
no Oppre&s;&s;ion, no Inju&s;tice, no Tyranny to com|plain
of?</P>
<P>In the next place, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are exhorted to con|&s;ider
on what Terms they &s;tand with the pre&s;ent Go|vernment.
It is true, that Her Maje&s;ty has on all Oc|ca&s;ions
graciou&s;ly been plea&s;ed to promi&s;e them Her
Royal Protection, and to pre&s;erve the Toleration inviola|bly:
But do they &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Promi&s;es do not imply
the Condition of their Dutiful and Peaceable Conduct
and Behaviour? Or do they &s;ugge&s;t that Her Maje&s;ty
is thereby bound in Honour to perform Her Promi&s;es in
the Letter of them; that they at the &s;ame time are left
at Liberty to offer the greate&s;t Affronts to Her Per&s;on
and admini&s;tration, upon the Pre&s;umption that their
Misbehaviour can no way affect her Maje&s;ty's Engage|ments,
which are not at all reciprocal in their Obliga|tions?</P>
<P>This has indeed been the very Practice of the Party
now embroiling this Nation; who, in the Ca&s;e of the
War, u&s;e the QUEEN ju&s;t after this manner, tho' it
mu&s;t be acknowledged it is very Di&s;ingenuous. Her
Maje&s;ty, upon the Change of the late Mini&s;try, not
&s;uppo&s;ing that Changing Hands only mu&s;t immediately
oblige Her to Change all Her Mea&s;ures, went on in the
very &s;ame Steps of Government as before, and for the
carrying on the War in Conjunction with Her Allies;
and frequent A&s;&s;urances were given from the Throne, that
it was both Her Maje&s;ty's Opinion and Re&s;olution to pu&s;h
<HI>France</HI> on by a vigorous War, to give a &s;afe and honour|able
Peace to <HI>Europe,</HI> to re&s;tore the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy,
and &s;atisfie all the Allies,</P>
<P>Immediately the Party thinking they had the Q&mdash;n
fa&s;t by the Letter of the&s;e Promi&s;es, fall to work to rai&s;e
Factions and Di&s;contents at home, to ruine Credit, to
di&s;able the Mini&s;try, and to make it impo&s;&s;ible for the
QUEEN to &s;upport that War, She had promi&s;ed to carry
on: As if that Promi&s;e was not made on a Suppo&s;ition of
the Dutiful A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Concurrence of Her People;
and as if Her Maje&s;ty was &s;o tied up, that when She
<PB N="28" REF="28">
&s;hould find a De&s;ign on foot to make that very War the
Ruine of Her Mea&s;ures; &s;hould find Her Mini&s;try op|pre&s;&s;ed
by a <HI>Faction,</HI> in hopes of plunging Her Affairs
into inextricable Difficulties; a Party rai&s;ed as well a|broad
as at home again&s;t Her Admini&s;tration; and tho&s;e
Men who were at the Head of Her Armies appearing open|ly
at the Head of tho&s;e Parties; and not to act counter to
Her Mea&s;ures only; but to threaten openly to oblige Her
to a <HI>Revolution</HI> in Her Hou&s;hold: I &s;ay, as if upon
Di&s;covery of &s;uch De&s;igns carrying on, to make the War
impracticable, but at the hazard of the Peace at Home,
Her Maje&s;ty was not at liberty to change tho&s;e Re&s;oluti|ons,
and regard the Safety of Her own Government, and
the Protection of Her faithful Servants from the Attacks
of an enraged Party!</P>
<P>In like manner it &s;eems rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that not|with&s;tanding
Her Maje&s;ty's gracious Promi&s;es to the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
of Protection, and maintaining inviolably their
Toleration, yet that this was always to be under&s;tood &s;o
far Conditionally, that they behaved them&s;elves Duti|fully
to Her Per&s;on, Peaceably to the Government, and
kept them&s;elves from embroiling the State; In the contra|ry
to which it mu&s;t be allowed to be very Ju&s;t, if Her
Maje&s;ty &s;hould upon &s;uch Occa&s;ion recommend it to Her
Parliament. That whereas Her Maje&s;ty had upon all Oc|ca&s;ions
indulged the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> not only in the Tolera|tion
and Exemption granted them by Law, but in &s;eve|ral
other Liberties which She might ju&s;tly have re&s;trained
them in; And whereas in might rea&s;onably have been ex|pected,
that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> would in return for &s;uch Fo|vours
have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their Dutiful and
Affectionate Behaviour to her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Go|vernment:
But that Her Maje&s;ty finding on the con|trary
that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in general are fallen in with a|betting
and &s;upporting the Factions and Di&s;contents of a
Party, who with an undutiful Behaviour endeavour to
di&s;turb the Peace of Her Maje&s;ty's Reign, and the ju&s;t
Mea&s;ures of Her Admini&s;tration; And that they are not
by any peaceable gentle Methods to be reclaim'd from
<PB N="29" REF="29">
the &s;aid Practice: And that the &s;aid <HI>Factions</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI>
are greatly encouraged and fomented by the &s;aid Conjun|ction
and Concurrence of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> with them:
That therefore Her Maje&s;ty thinks them unworthy any
further Protection; and recommends it to Her People to
think of &s;ome Methods to reduce them to a greater Sen&s;e
of their Duty, from which too much Liberty or the abu&s;e
of that Liberty has encouraged them to decline.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> would timely con|&s;ider
what would be the Con&s;equence, if Her Maje&s;ty
&s;hould be provoked by their pre&s;ent Conduct to proceed
in &s;uch a manner: And whether it would be difficult to
move any Dutiful <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> &s;o far to enter into
Her Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t Re&s;entments, as to take &s;uch Mea&s;ures
to humble the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> as Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould think
&s;ufficient, and as would effectually take from them all
the Power they think they now have to animate and en|courage

<P>This is the friendly Advice de&s;igned by this <HI>Letter.</HI>
The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are not &s;o Ignorant as not to know
what is their proper Duty in &s;o nice a Juncture; and
that between Two Intere&s;ts &s;o full of Animo&s;ity, as it

Protection they enjoy'd, till &s;omething el&s;e than mere

and of &s;ome Injuries which the Law might have
ju&s;tified them by &s;eeking Redre&s;s again&s;t. But while
this is their Ca&s;e, and they have no &s;uch Complaint to
make, they are wholly inexcu&s;able in their pre&s;ent Con|duct:
And this is earne&s;tly Recommended to them to

But all the&s;e Retorts &s;hall be thrown a&s;ide in a few
Words. This <HI>Letter</HI> does not charge the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> or &s;o
much as enquire, how far they are concerned or are not
concerned in the undutiful Conduct of tho&s;e who are &s;po|ken
of. The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> may ask them&s;elves the Que&s;tion,
what they are Guilty of, and &s;ave tho&s;e who wi&s;h them
well the unplea&s;ant Office of Di&s;criminating: Neither does
this <HI>Letter</HI> offer to divide them from, or engage them to
any Side or Party; and for that Rea&s;on was not publi&s;hed
(tho' long ago written) till all their Joining and Voting on
one Side or other, was fini&s;hed and over. The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
know be&s;t whether there are any of the People here &s;poken
of, among them or no.</P>
<P>They are here only calmly advi&s;ed not to embroil them|&s;elves
with their Sovereign and with her Admini&s;tration,
for no Cau&s;e, and for they know not who. While the
Laws and tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential Branches of Government, Liber|ty,
Property and Religion, are whole and untouched:
What can be of Moment &s;ufficient for the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
to appear again&s;t the Government, if the Laws are not
broken?</P>
<P>If it be not true, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have too much
joined with abetted, countenanced and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Faction</HI>
afore&s;aid in the&s;e Things, it is by &s;o much their Advantage
and this Advice may be thought &s;o far Needle&s;s: but if
they lay their Hands on their Hearts, they may &s;ee more
Cau&s;e for this Advice than they are willing to own.</P>
<P>Again, It may be offered in excu&s;e of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> that
although perhaps &s;ome hot Men among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> may
have been too forward, and may have &s;hewn &s;ome Indi&s;cre|tion,
<PB N="31" REF="31">
yet that the whole Body of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> ought not
to &s;uffer Blame on their Account.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The Advice is to the <HI>Guilty</HI> only, and it is
friendly and brief: That they would &s;top in time, and &s;ee
that they involve not the <HI>Innocent</HI> in the Ruin due to their
Folly; and to the <HI>Innocent</HI> the Advice is equally whol&s;ome,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> To di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, by &s;uch Methods as
they &s;hall &s;ee rea&s;onable, from tho&s;e who are <HI>Guilty;</HI> that
it may be known there are &s;ome among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
who do not approve their Indi&s;cretion, and that the Go|vernment
may be moved not to re&s;ent it upon the whole
Body.</P>
