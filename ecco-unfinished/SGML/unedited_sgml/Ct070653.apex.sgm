<P>THE End of Satyr is Reformation: And the Author, tho he doubts the Work of Conver&s;&punc; is at a general Stop, has put his Hand to the Plow.&mdash;I expect a Storm of Ill Langu$ from the Fury of the Town, and e&s;pecially from tho&s;e whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Talent it is to Ra And without being taken for a Conjurer, I may venture to foretell, That I &s;hall be Cavil'd at a b$ <HI>Mean Stile, Rough Ver&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Incorrect Language;</HI> Things I might indeed have taken more Care But the Book is Printed; and tho I &s;ee &s;ome Faults, 'tis too late to mend them. And this is all I thi needful to &s;ay to them.&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly &s;omeby may take me for a <HI>Dutchman;</HI> in which they they a mi&s;taken: But I am one that would be glad to &s;ee <HI>Engl &s;hmen</HI> behave them&s;elves better to Strange &amp; to Governors al&s;o; that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries, for belonging to <HI>a Nati that wants Manners.</HI>&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Strangers u&s;e us better abroard; and we can give $ rea&s;on but our Ill Nature for the contrary here.&mdash;Methinks an <HI>Engli&s;hman&punc;</HI> who is &s;o proud of b ing call'd <HI>A Goodfellox,</HI> &s;hou'd be civil: And it cannot be denied but we are in many Ca&s;es, and pa ticularly to Strangers, the Churli&s;he&s;t People alive.&mdash;As to Vices, who can di&s;pute our Intemperan$ whil&s;t an <HI>Hone&s;t Drunken Fellow</HI> is a Character in a man's Prai&s;e? All our Reformations are Banter and will be &s;o, till our Magi&s;trates and Gentry Reform them&s;elves by way of Example; then, and n$ till then, they may be expected to puni&s;h others without Blu&s;hing.&mdash;As to our <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> I d &s;ire to be under&s;tood of that particular People, who pretending to be Prote&s;tants, have all alo$ endeavour'd to reduce the Liberties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of <HI>King James</HI> a$ his Popi&s;h Powers: Together with &s;uch who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the pre&s;ent Govern+ment, and yet abu&s;e and affront the King who procur'd it, and openly profe&s;s their Unea&s;ine&s;s und$ him: The&s;e, by what&s;oever Names or Titles they are dignified or di&s;tingui&s;h'd, are the People aim$ at: Nor do I di&s;own, but that it is &s;o much the Temper of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to abu&s;e his E$nefacto that I could be glad to &s;ee it rectified.&mdash;They who think I have been guilty of any Error, in expo&s;in the Crimes of my own Countrymen to them&s;elves, may among many hone&s;t $n&s;tances of the li$ nature, find the &s;ame thing in Mr. <HI>Cowly,</HI> in his Imitation of the &s;econd Olympick Ode of <HI>Pindar His Words are the&s;e;</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SPeak, <HI>Satyr;</HI> for there's none can tell like thee,</L>
<L>Whether 'tis Folly, Pride, or Knavery,</L>
<L>That makes this di&s;contented Land appear</L>
<L>Le&s;s happy now in Times of Peace, than War:</L>
<L>Why Civil Feuds di&s;turb the Nation more</L>
<L>Than all our Bloody Wars have done before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fools out of Favour grudge at Knaves in Place,</L>
<L>And men are always hone&s;t in Di&s;grace:</L>
<L>The Court-Preferments make men Knaves in cour&s;e:</L>
<L>But they which wou'd be in them wou'd be wor&s;e.</L>
<L>'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine,</L>
<L>Wou`d Foreigners their Perqui&s;ities re&s;ign:</L>
<L>The Grand Contention's plainly to be &s;een,</L>
<L>To get &s;ome men put out, and &s;ome put in.</L>
<L>For this our S&mdash;rs make long Harangues,</L>
<L>And florid M&mdash;rs whet their poli&s;h'd Tongues.</L>
<L>State&s;men are always &s;ick of one Di&s;ea&s;e;</L>
<L>And a good Pen&s;ion gives them pre&s;ent Ea&s;e.</L>
<L>That's the Specifick makes them all content</L>
<L>With any King, and any Government.</L>
<L>Good Patriots at Court-Abu&s;es rail,</L>
<L>And all the Nation's Grievances bewail:</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Sov'reign Bal&s;am</HI>'s once apply'd,</L>

<L>How by their Aid we fir&s;t di&s;&s;olv`d our Fears,</L>

<L>`Tis worth ob&s;erving, that we ne`re complain`d</L>

<L>Wi&s;e men affirm it is <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> way,</L>
<L>Never to Grumble till they come to Pay;</L>
<L>And then they always think their Temper's &s;uch,</L>
<L>The Work too little, and the Pay too much.</L>
<L>As frighted Patients, when then they want a Cure</L>
<L>Bid any Price, and any Pain endure:</L>
<L>But when the Doctor`s Remedies appear,</L>
<L>The Cure`s too Ea&s;y, and the Price too Dear.</L>
<L>Great <HI>Portland</HI> ne're was banter`d, when he &s;trove</L>
<L>For Us his Ma&s;ter`s kinde&s;t Thoughts to move.</L>
<L>We ne`re lampoon`d his Conduct, when employ`d</L>
<L>King <HI>Jame$</HI>`s Secret Council to divide:</L>
<L>Then we carele&s;s`d him as the only Man,</L>
<L>Which could the Doubtful Oracle explain:</L>
<L>The only <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> able to repell</L>
<L>The Dark De&s;igns of our <HI>A$$itop$el,</HI></L>
<L>Compar`d his Ma&s;ter`s Courage to his Sen&s;e;</L>
<L>The Able&s;t State&s;man, and the Brave&s;t Prince.</L>

<L>Nor was he valued more than he de&s;erv`d;</L>
<L>Freely he ventur`d, faithfully he &s;erv`d,</L>
<L>In all King <HI>William</HI>`s Dangers he has &s;har`d;</L>
<L>In <HI>England</HI>`s Quarrels always he appear`d:</L>
<L>The <HI>Revolution</HI> fir&s;t, and then the <HI>Boyne;</HI></L>
<L>In Both his Coun&s;els and hir Conduct &s;hine,</L>
<L>His Martial Valour <HI>Flanders</HI> will confe&s;s:</L>

<L>Ten Years in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service he appear`d,</L>

<L>But `tis not <HI>England</HI>`s Cu&s;tom to Reward.</L>
<L>The Wars are over, <HI>England</HI> needs him not:</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Sconbergh,</HI> the Able&s;t Soldier of his Age,</L>
<L>With <HI>Great Na&s;&s;au</HI> did in our Cau&s;e engage:</L>

<L>The Greate&s;t Captain, and the Greate&s;t Prince.</L>
<L>With what applau&s;e his Stories did we tell?</L>
<L>Stories which <HI>Europe</HI>`s Volumes largely &s;well.</L>
<L>We counted him an Army in our Aid:</L>
<L>Where he commanded, no man was afraid.</L>
<L>His Actions with a con&s;tant Conque&s;t &s;hine,</L>
<L>From <HI>Villa-Vitio&s;&s;a</HI> to the <HI>Rhine.</HI></L>
<L><HI>France, Flanders, Germany,</HI> his Fame confe&s;s:</L>
<L>And all the World was fond of him, but Us.</L>
<L>Our turn fir&s;t &s;erv`d, we grudg`d him the comma$</L>
<L>Witne&s;s the Grateful Temper of the Land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We blame the K&mdash;that he relies too much</L>
<L>On Strangers, <HI>Germans, Hugonots,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI></L>
<L>And &s;eldom does his great Affairs of State,</L>
<L>To <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coun&s;ellors communicate.</L>
<L>The Fact might very well be an&s;wer`d thus,</L>
<L>He has &s;o often been betray`d by us,</L>
<L>He mu&s;t have been a Madman to rely</L>
<L>On <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> G&mdash;ns Fidelity.</L>
<L>For laying other Arguments a&s;ide,</L>
<L>This Thought might mortify our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prid$</L>
<L>That Foreigners have faithfully obey`d him,</L>
<L>And none but <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> have e`er betray`d $word$</L>
<L>They have our Ships &amp; Merchants bought &amp; $word$</L>

<L>And Injur`d <HI>Tarlmar&s;h</HI> next at <HI>Carmaret.</HI></L>
<L>The King him&s;elf is &s;helter`d from their Snare</L>

<L>Experience tells us `tis the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> way</L>
