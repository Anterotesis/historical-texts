<P>Upon the SECOND Article,&mdash; <Q>Suf|fering &startq;the offices of the hou&s;e called Stanhope's Tower to continue unde|moli&s;hed, which gave the Enemy the great advantage of immediately ta|king po&s;t there, to the no &s;mall detri|ment and annoyance of his Maje&s;ty's &endq;troops,&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>Upon the SIXTH Article,&mdash; <Q>Suf|fering &startq;the Enemy to carry on a Sap, and erect their batteries behind &s;ome weak &s;tone walls; although it was obvious, that a proper and vigorous exertion of artillery would either have prevented, or at lea&s;t greatly retarded, &endq;their approaches and con&s;truction,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>

<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="5">manding Officer of Artillery, who can upon the &s;malle&s;t notice com|municate with the Governor, who &endq;is ever watchful,</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;which Order tended greatly to invite and facilitate the Enemy's approach, and numerous opportunities of ob|&s;tructing their movements were there|by &endq;lo&s;t,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. Gen. Murray is GUILTY; &mdash; although it does not appear to the Cou$t, that the Order was i&s;|&s;ued with any intention of invi|ting the Enemy's approach;</P>
<P>And the Court do adjudge, That, in re&s;pect of his mi&s;conduct in this in&s;tance, he be reprimanded in &s;uch manner as his Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit to direct, for having given out an Order, which was de|trimental to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and excluded the Lieutenant-Go|vernor from an authority with which a junior Officer was in|ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>Upon the NINTH Article,&mdash; <Q>Or|dering &startq;&s;everal &s;hips, and their con|tents, to a great amount, to be &s;unk; among others, the Minorca, a new frigate, which might have e&s;caped in &s;afety with only thirty five hands, and the General Murray privateer, with twenty hands; which ve&s;&s;els might have been u&s;efully employed &endq;for the King's &s;ervice,</Q>&mdash;</P>

<P>That Lieut. Gen. Murray is NOT GUILTY, and do therefore acquit him;</P>
<P>And the Court think it incumbent upon them, to remark, that this Article of Charge contains a par|tial quotation from the order in que&s;tion, the whole whereof, al|though injudiciou&s;ly worded in the part alluded to, collectively taken, bears a very different con|&s;truction.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,&mdash; <Q>Aban|doning, &startq;and blowing up, all the places of arms, and communications of the Inner Covered Way, the night after he had given out, in public orders, that in ca&s;e of alarm, he &s;hould be &s;ound in the part of the

<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>

<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Fir&s;t Part</HI> of the FIFTH Article,&mdash; <Q>De&s;iring (with a view to &startq;magnify the &s;ickne&s;s of the garri&s;on, which it is admitted was &s;ickly, and thereby to ju&s;tify his &s;urrender) that the re&s;pective Commanding Officers would march out their corps as weak &endq;as po&s;&s;ible,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the SAME Article,&mdash; <Q>Suppre&s;&s;ing, in his report &startq;to the Secretary of State, the men|tion of the Marine Corps, which alone con&s;i&s;ted of four hundred and thirty fit for duty, with one hundred and twenty-five Artillery-men, be|&s;ides Greeks, Algerines, and Cor|&s;icans, &endq;</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>C&mdash;<HI>As to the In&s;tance of Bad Con|duct after the Siege,</HI>&mdash;viz.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Suffering the Spani&s;h General to turn him out of the Fortre&s;s, before the Articles of Capitulation were &s;igned; and not taking any ho&s;tages &endq;for the &s;ecurity of his Garri&s;on,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>

<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the matters com|prehended under the general head or de&s;cription of</P>
<P>E &mdash; <HI>Rapacity and Extortion, particulari&s;ed in the following In|&s;tances,</HI></P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, upon the FIRST Article,&mdash; <Q>Obliging the &startq;Troops and Inhabitants to receive in payment a Guinea as Four and Twenty Shillings; at which rate the
<PB N="8" REF="10">Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds &s;ent by Go|vernment for Contingencies were i&s;|&s;ued, to the great di&s;content and detriment of the Troops and Inha|bitants,&endq;</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,&mdash; <Q>Ex|acting &startq;a large Sum, by an arbitrary Impo&s;ition on all Auctions, to the great lo&s;s of the parties concerned in them; and notwith&s;tanding he agreed to take a fixed Allowance from Government, in lieu of all &endq;Perqui&s;ites,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. Gen. Murray is GUILTY&mdash;and do adjudge, that he be repri|manded in &s;uch manner, as His Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit to direct, for having taken a perqui&s;ite im|properly, and contrary to the apparent intention of Govern|ment, when a fixed allowance was made for &s;atisfying all contin|gencies:</P>
<P>And the Court, ina&s;much as it has been &s;ugge&s;ted by Lieut. General Murray, in the cour&s;e of his de|fence to this Article of Charge, that his receiving, as a perqui&s;ite, a moiety of the &s;ee of one and half <HI>per cent.</HI> paid to the Auctioneer upon the &s;ale of prize goods, is conformable to the practice which obtains at Gibraltar, think them|&s;elves indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to ob|&s;erve, that there has not been laid before them any evidence, nor do they &s;ee any ground whatever to &s;uppo&s;e, that any &s;uch perqui&s;ite is taken, or claimed, by the Go|vernor of Gibraltar.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the matters com|prehended under the general head or de&s;cription of</P>
<P>F&mdash;<HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion and Cruelty, par|ticulari&s;ed in the following In|&s;tances,</HI></P>
<P>FIRST, The Court are of opinion upon the FIRST Article,&mdash; <Q>Wantonly &startq;incen&s;ing the minds of the principal Gentry of the I&s;land again&s;t His Maje&s;ty's Government, by mo&s;t vio|lently di&s;arming and di&s;gracing them, becau&s;e a De&s;erter had not been di&s;|covered, &endq;and given up,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>That Lieut. Gen. Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,&mdash; <Q>Per|&s;onally &startq;beating &s;everal Spani&s;h Pri|&s;oners, who were &s;tanding at the door of their pri&s;on, breathing a purer air,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the THIRD and la&s;t Article,&mdash; <Q>&startq;Impri&s;oning a man of good character, named Goya, for many weeks, with|out &s;ufficient cau&s;e, and without bringing him to any trial, or exami|nation; under which confinement &endq;Goya de&s;troyed him&s;elf,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears to the Court, from the evidence,
<PB N="9" REF="11">That Lieut. General Murray did conduct him&s;elf with great zeal, courage, and firmne&s;s, in the de|fence of Fort St. Philip,&mdash;That the place was not half garri&s;oned,&mdash;had not any pro&s;pect of relief,&mdash;and was not given up, till it was become, from the enfeebled &s;tate of the Garri&s;on, no longer tenable;</P>
<P>And that &s;everal of the Articles of Charge, which have been preferred again&s;t Lieut. Gen. Murray, are frivolous and ill-founded.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the matter of Per|&s;onal Complaint exhibited by Sir William Draper, who repre&s;ents, That he has been per&s;onally ag|grieved and wronged by Lieut. Gen. Murray, in four &s;everal in|&s;tances,&mdash;</P>
<P>As to the FIRST Article of Com|plaint,&mdash; <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray &startq;i&s;&s;ued an order on the 15th day of October la&s;t, tending to di&s;honour and di&s;grace him, and to prevent him from doing his duty as Lieute|nant &endq;Governor,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Sir William Draper is founded in this Article of Complaint, as it does appear to them, that the order to which the Complaint refers, did tend to di&s;honour and di&s;grace him.</P>
<P>As to the SECOND Article of Com|plaint,&mdash; <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray &startq;fal&s;ely charged him with an attempt to take the command from him, the &endq;Governor in Chief,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, that Sir William Draper has not &s;u&s;tained the grievance which this Article &s;uppo&s;es, as the words contained in Gen. Murray's letter of the 16th of January, 1782, which has been adduced as evidence of the fact, do not, in their judgement, im|port a charge of any actual attempt made to take the command from him; but, in uni&s;on with the re&s;t of the letter, expre&s;s &s;trongly Lieut. Gen. Murray's &s;en&s;e of Sir William Draper's conduct, which appeared to him calculated to enervate his authority and com|mand.</P>
<P>As to the THIRD Article of Com|plaint,&mdash; <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray &startq;&s;uper&s;eded him in his command, as Lieutenant Governor, without ju&s;t &endq;cau&s;e,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Sir William Draper was not aggrieved or wronged in this in&s;tance, the &s;uper&s;e&s;&s;ion being no more than Sir William Draper appears to have expected, in ca&s;e Lieut. Gen. Murray did not think it proper to a&s;&s;emble a Council of War, nor than his letter to Lieut. Gen. Murray warranted and called for.</P>
<P>As to the FOURTH Article of Com|plaint,&mdash; <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray &startq;gave out, that the &s;aid Lieutenant Governor had advi&s;ed him to &s;urren|der &endq;the place &s;ooner than he did,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Sir William Draper is not founded in this Article of Complaint, the fact of Lieut. Gen. Murray having at any time expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to that effect not being &s;upported by evidence.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<P>The Court, before they quit this &s;ub|ject, conceive it to be a duty ab&s;o|lutely incumbent upon them, to point out &s;ome very offen&s;ive words, which have appeared before them in evidence, contained in a letter from Sir William Draper to Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.&mdash;"Your in&s;i|nuation that I am attempting to take the command from you, is <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>infamous;</HI>" and al&s;o an expre&s;&s;ion contained in an an&s;wer to the &s;aid letter, from Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.&mdash;"As to the per|&s;onal abu&s;e, I &s;hall do ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, you may be a&s;&s;ured, when the proper time arrives:"&mdash;and humbly to &s;ubmit the &s;ame to his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ideration, that his Maje&s;ty may, if in his wi&s;dom he &s;hall think fit, interpo&s;e his royal authority and injunction, to pre|vent the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences between the parties.</P>
<P>ON the 30th of January, the Court-Martial being re-convened, pur&s;uant to an Order from His Maje&s;ty, Lieut. Gen. Murray and Sir William Draper were called into Court; when the Judge-Advocate General read to them the foregoing determination of the Court-Martial, upon the &s;everal matters of charge and complaint which had been referred, by His Maje&s;ty's Warrant, for their deci&s;ion; together with His Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure thereon, as follows; namely,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;THAT the King had declared his Royal Approbation of the opinion of the Court-Martial, upon every point; but that, in con&s;ideration as well of the zeal, courage, and firmne&s;s, with which Lieut. Gen. Murray appears to the Court to have conducted him&s;elf, in the de&s;ence of Fort St. Philip, as of his former long and approved &s;ervices, His Maje&s;ty had been gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e with any other reprimand, in re&s;pect of the mi&s;conduct whereof he has in two in&s;tances been found guilty, than that &endq;which the Sentence of the Court-Martial in it&s;elf virtually conveys:</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;And that His Maje&s;ty had, at the &s;ame time, expre&s;&s;ed much concern, that an Officer of Sir William Draper's rank, and di&s;tingui&s;hed character, &s;hould &s;uffer his judgement to be &s;o far perverted, by any &s;en&s;e of per|&s;onal grievance, as to view the general conduct of his &s;uperior Officer in an unfavourable light; and, in con&s;equence, to exhibit &s;everal charges, which the Court-Martial, after a diligent inve&s;tigation, have deemed to &endq;be frivolous, or ill-founded.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;Giving out an Order, dated October the 15th, <HI>1781,</HI> to the following Effect: That no Gun, or any Piece of Ordnance, hereafter to be fired in Day-Light, without Orders from the Commanding Officer of the Artillery, who can upon the &s;malle&s;t &endq;Notice communicate with the Governor, who is ever watchful</Q>&mdash;</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I BEG leave to ob&s;erve to the Court, that this Order is not perfectly &s;tated&mdash;it is mutilated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Draper may &s;tate the order in his charge as he plea&s;es; and he is to make it out as he can: but when it is produced in evidence, the whole order mu&s;t be read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>May I take my oath to this bu&s;ine&s;s my&s;elf? Is it u&s;ual, as I am the pro&s;ecutor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is not illegal; Sir William Draper certainly is competent to give his evidence: I am glad he tenders him&s;elf &s;o openly at the out&s;et, before he has called in the evidence to it.&mdash;If any member has a doubt about it, he has only to ri&s;e, and have the Court cleared, while we con&s;ider of it.&mdash;Does Gen. Murray take any ob|jection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is in the brea&s;t of the Court, certainly, to do as they plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you have any objections, Gen. Murray, you will plea&s;e to &s;tate them; the Court will then have the room cleared, and take the matter into con&s;ideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is unu&s;ual: the charge is again&s;t me for i&s;&s;uing that order: I &s;hall not deny the order if it is produced entire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As I &s;aid before, if you have any objections, you will &s;tate them; and the Court will immediately take tho&s;e objections into con&s;ideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is unu&s;ual&mdash;I ne|ver heard of the practice before.&mdash;I wi&s;h to be tried, as other men have been tried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If the order is read, and Gen. Murray will admit it, it will &s;ave Sir William Draper the trouble of giving evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Sir William Draper does not mean to prove the order by his evidence, but what is alledged concerning the order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think, that Sir William Draper, who is my accu&s;er (and not a very mild one) ought not to give evidence as to the con&s;equences of the order. The order is clear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Draper tenders an information to the Crown; which the Crown, upon advi&s;ing with its proper officers, is of opinion, ought to be &s;ent to trial by a Court-Martial.&mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="14">Does it &s;trike any per&s;on, that the per|&s;on giving the information, is precluded from giving evidence?&mdash;How far it may be &s;u&s;picious, how far it may be de&s;irable, are all circum&s;tances for the Court to con&s;ider. The que&s;tion is now, Whether he is a competent witne&s;s? I rather wi&s;h to &s;peak my &s;entiments upon it in public.&mdash;If you choo&s;e to have the court cleared, it is my duty to attend you; and you &s;ometimes do me the honour to call for my opinion, and then it is my duty to give it; but it does not &s;trike me at pre&s;ent, that the &s;ituation of Sir William Draper, as the accu&s;er, can effect his competency, as a witne&s;s. If we apply it to the ordi|nary courts of law, &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e that frequently occurs:&mdash;Does not the per&s;on who is robbed, who tenders the information, and who conducts the pro&s;ecution, always give evidence?&mdash;If there appears, from the whole of the ca&s;e, any thing like rancour, ulti|mately the Court will give le&s;s credit, to be &s;ure, to a witne&s;s under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, than if he were not un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances: but we are only now &s;peaking to the competency; and I &s;ubmit my opinion to the Court, that Sir William Draper is competent to give evidence.</P>

<STAGE><HI>(The order read from the orderly book.)</HI></STAGE>
<P><Q>&startq;No officer, for the future, on guard, is to quit his po&s;t, on any ac|count whatever; neither, here|after, in day-light, is a gun, or any piece of ordnance, to be fired, without orders from the commanding officer of artillery, who can, on the &s;lighte&s;t no|tice, communicate with the Governor, who is ever watch|ful. The pu&s;illanimity of the Enemy is &s;ufficiently con&s;pi|cuous to the mo&s;t undi&s;cerning per&s;on in this garri&s;on; the me|thod which can be devi&s;ed to make them brave, is by accu&s;|toming them to an ineffectual &endq;fire from us.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you ever ob&s;erved opportunities of annoying the Enemy, and checking their progre&s;s, lo&s;t, by the order that has been ju&s;t read?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have &s;een opportuni|ties, where the Enemy might have been annoyed, if the Artillery Officers had had the liberty of firing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beg you will men|tion any in&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To the be&s;t of my recollection, one in&s;tance I do remember. There was a <HI>&s;ortie</HI> made to de&s;troy a &s;trong &s;entry-box, which was pretty near to the Quay-guard, the place where we u&s;ually kept a guard before the &s;iege. I was on the top of the Ca&s;tle, with my per&s;pective gla&s;s, in order to &s;ee the movements of the <HI>&s;ortie;</HI> I ob&s;erved the Enemy come down in numbers be|hind the walls that were between the Quay-guard and George Town; I counted one hundred and &s;ixty Grena|diers behind one wall, be&s;ides many that had taken po&s;t behind other walls: I remarked to &s;ome that were about me, that it was a &s;hame the Artillery did not fire, becau&s;e the Enemy were near enought to be annoyed by them;
<PB N="13" REF="15">and, to the be&s;t of my recollection, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Capt. Fead, of the Artillery. I don't &s;wear it was Capt. Fead; but, to the be&s;t of my recollec|tion, it was him. I &s;hewed him the Enemy; I gave him my gla&s;s, and he counted pretty nearly the &s;ame number I had done: I told him, it was a &s;hame the cannon did not fire, and &s;ome of the mortars, becau&s;e I was very &s;ure, if they did, the Enemy mu&s;t be much annoyed by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know the day of the month?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: I think it was in Augu&s;t that the <HI>&s;ortie</HI> was &s;ent out upon that occa&s;ion: the orderly book will &s;hew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the rea&s;on given you for not firing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Capt. Fead, or the Gentleman I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to, &s;aid he could not fire without an order; and he &s;aid he would go immediately to Major Wal|ton, to receive his orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did the Artillery fire in con&s;equence of any orders upon this occa&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To the be&s;t of my recollection they did; but it was then too late, becau&s;e the Enemy, we had &s;een, were then moving off: they did not fire at the time; they might have taken an advantage of the Enemy; but, to the be&s;t of my recollection, a few did fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ob&s;erve any other opportunity lo&s;t, in con&s;equence of the order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you, by this order, judge that you your&s;elf was incapacitated to give orders to fire, without Major Walton's leave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The words of the order it|&s;elf, I &s;hould think, would explain this que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think I had any au|thority to order the Artillery to fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you judge that I my&s;elf was incapacitated by that order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is all matter of opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to a&s;k this que&s;tion, from what I &s;aw in the news-papers this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It has been proved, over and over again, in evidence, that the Ar|tillery &s;hould not fire without a com|mand from Major Walton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The que&s;tion is, Whether he thinks I am comprehended in that order, as Lieut. General and Lieut. Governor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The next in command is as much &s;o as the younge&s;t officer. It goes to include every per&s;on, to be &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever ob&s;erve any marks of in&s;anity, or in&s;ufficiency, in me, &s;o as to think me incapable of giving orders?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I never did, but though the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you a&s;certain at what di&s;tance from the works of the garri&s;on the wall was that you &s;aw tho&s;e Grenadiers behind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot a&s;certain the real di|&s;tance; I &s;hould judge, from the eye, the wall was about eleven hundred, or twelve hundred yards, that they were behind, from the top of the Ca&s;tle where I was; they might be a good deal nearer &s;ome of the outworks. The wall they were drawn up behind, was nearer a good deal than George Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mention to the Court what other works the&s;e Grenadiers, that
<PB N="14" REF="16">were po&s;ted behind the wall, could be &s;een from.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould imagine, from all the works on the north and north-we&s;t &s;ides of the garri&s;on: I think they might plainly be &s;een from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether or not the Artillery, that fired upon tho&s;e troops, did not fire immediately after the <HI>&s;ortie</HI> came in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There was &s;ome little firing; I think it was after the <HI>&s;ortie</HI> returned into the garri&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it &s;oon after?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot a&s;certain: I think the <HI>&s;ortie</HI> had returned into the garri&s;on; I think it was much about, or ju&s;t at the time the <HI>&s;ortie</HI> returned into the gar|ri&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;aid other op|portunities had been lo&s;t; I de&s;ire you will mention tho&s;e opportunities to the Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot particulari&s;e the oppor|tunities; but I have &s;een many in|&s;tances where parties of the Enemy have pa&s;&s;ed from one po&s;t to another, that I thought might have been an|noyed by the Artillery, if the Artillery had been made u&s;e of again&s;t them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whereabouts, and at what di&s;tance from the forts, did you &s;ee tho&s;e parties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't pretend to judge the di|&s;tance; but I have &s;een them moving towards Col. Mackellar's; I have &s;een them moving towards Stanhope's Tower; and I have frequently &s;een par|ties in arms pa&s;&s;ing towards Turk's-Mount.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did the&s;e parties re|main any con&s;iderable time in our &s;ight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes they were hid by their own works: then they would ap|pear in openings as they were marching along: &s;ometimes I have had a view of them for three, four, or five mi|nutes; I have &s;een them pa&s;&s;ing where no works have been thrown up&mdash; through the fields.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Q.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ing through the fields, within the di&s;tance of being an|noyed by the Garri&s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think they might, both by &s;hells, and by artillery too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you could a&s;|certain the di&s;tance the&s;e men were from us, which you &s;aw in the fields?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e men I &s;aw in the fields, pa&s;&s;ing from one work to the other, might be at the di&s;tance of fourteen or fifteen hundred yards; I mean, from the top of the Ca&s;tle: I have &s;een them in &s;everal places, &s;ome places nearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand that the Colonel thinks, at fourteen or fifteen hundred yards men pa&s;&s;ing in file might be annoyed by the Artillery?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is the purport of his evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beg to a&s;k, what is the di&s;tance of the &s;pace between the top of the Ca&s;tle and the outworks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ituations of the outworks were at different di&s;tances: the re|doubts of the outward line, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the farthe&s;t of them to be about four hundred yards or more; but I cannot attempt to a&s;certain any certain di&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From whence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From the top of the Ca&s;tle the Marlborough was a great deal father; I cannot pretend to a&s;certain the di|&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you think they could have been &s;een from the Marlborough?</P>
</SP>

<P>At what di&s;tance were they from Fort Marlborough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot pretend to form any idea: there was a cove run up to the right &s;ide of the Marlborough, and then a gully between where the men were and the Marlborough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot a&s;certain the di&s;tance from Fort Marlborough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, becau&s;e there was a gully between the Fort, and the fields they were marching over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is a barranca.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h to know how often you was at the Marlborough du|ring the blockade, and at what time of the day?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As I had no duty there, I was not in the Marlborough, I believe, during the blockade, above twice. I believe I might be twice; I am not po&s;itive whether it was during the blockade.

<P>I cannot pretend to &s;ay the di|&s;tance of the road from the Marlbo|rough.</P>

<P>Were they upon that road?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They were not in the road. Where I &s;aw them, was behind a wall which they had thrown up, leading to|wards Turk's-Mount. An angle of that wall came oppo&s;ite to the &s;alient angle of the Marlborough, which I judge to be about the di&s;tance of three hundred yards, or between two and three hundred yards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I mean through the embra&s;ures. I think, to the be&s;t of my recollection, there was a gra&s;shopper in the &s;alient angle, which could have commanded it; but I am not &s;ure whether it was a gra&s;shopper or wall-piece that was in the &s;alient angle.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not. I &s;aw an order from Major Walton to the Artillery, not to fire; but I could not obey that order; I did not look upon it as di|rected to me. I had a di&s;cretionary power from Gen. Murray to fire as I &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Every one of that Fort was un|der my command; and doubtle&s;s were to obey my orders. No order from Major Walton could affect me. There was an order from Major Walton to the Artillery not to fire.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Lieut. Gen. <HI>MURRAY</HI> delivered into Court the following Paper; which was read by the <HI>JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE order of the 15th of Octo|ber is not fairly tran&s;cribed by my Accu&s;er, as has been &s;hewn to the Court; and I mu&s;t again beg the whole order may be produced, and read.</P>
<P>The young Officers of the garri&s;on began to be tired of their inactive con|finement: they wi&s;hed to fire the can|non at &s;ingle men, or imaginary objects; &s;ome went &s;o far as to fire at Bugats, or figures dre&s;&s;ed like men, which the Enemy had exhibited in ridicule of our ineffectual firing. To indulge the young Officers in this propen&s;ity, I or|dered wall-pieces to be fixed on the &s;alient angle of the outworks, which I permitted them to u&s;e at di&s;cre|tion for &s;ome time; but finding all animadver&s;ions ineffectual, I i&s;&s;ued the order in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Had it not been for this order, great part of our ammunition would have been u&s;ele&s;sly expended, before the Enemy began their batteries (and even with this precaution, it has evidently appeared that we &s;hould have been de|ficient in powder, had not an unfore&s;een &s;ickne&s;s &s;hortened the time of our de|fence): be&s;ides, as I have ob&s;erved in my an&s;wer to the Sixth Charge, the embra&s;ures and merlons of the batteries would have been de&s;troyed by our own idle firing. The order, however, did not extend to firing in the night, when the operations of the Enemy were chiefly carried on, nor to the detached work of the Marlborough; and I be&s;ides ex|plained the intent of it, and gave a rea&s;onable latitude to tho&s;e officers who were not within its &s;pirit.</P>
<P>As to Capt. Parry, he was among tho&s;e who were mo&s;t wanton, and lea&s;t controulable in the direction of his fire. It was upon a complaint from Major Walton that he was tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing again&s;t my orders in this re&s;pect, that I threa|tened to bring him to a General Court-Martial: but as to treating him in the
<PB N="21" REF="23">indignant manner he has repre&s;ented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">Capt. Parry &s;wore, that Gen. Murray rai&s;ed his cane over him in a menacing manner, at the time he threatened to bring him to a Court-Martial;&mdash;Lieut. Douglas, who was pre&s;ent at the time, &s;wore, that no &s;uch circum&s;tance happened.</NOTE>, I deny it, as has been proved by Lieut. Douglas, who was pre&s;ent. Capt. Parry has given evidence, that at the Bourgeois battery, oppo&s;ite the Queen's, there was a di&s;continuance of firing for &s;ome few days; although it has been proved that this battery was not begun until the night between the 9th and 10th of December, and Capt. Parry acknow|ledges he went to the Ho&s;pital on the 5th of December, and I &s;hall likewi&s;e &s;hew that he did not return from thence until the 8th of January following. Another part of this gentleman's evi|dence is, the &s;aying he fired upon carriages in the road from the Guard-hou&s;e to Stanhope's Tower, when I &s;hall &s;hew it was &s;hut up by the traver&s;es; be&s;ides the improbability of the enemy's u&s;ing a road entirely expo&s;ed to our fire, when they had another, in the rear of their batteries, more convenient, and properly protected. Col. Acklom's evidence goes to prove our not firing, on the day of the <HI>&s;ortie,</HI> at men not interrupting our operations whom I wi&s;hed to invite nearer. I hope the Court will be &s;ufficiently convinced of the propriety of my conduct in re&s;er|ving our fire on that occa&s;ion; and I &s;hall &s;hew that only two or three guns could bear on that place mentioned by the Colonel, where the Enemy was a&s;|&s;embled. And here it is remarkable, that when Col. Acklom is called upon to &s;ummon all his reflection, and par|ticulari&s;e any other in&s;tances when and where he &s;aw the omi&s;&s;ion of firing that might otherwi&s;e annoy the Enemy, he mentions a time when he cro&s;&s;ed the water and vi&s;ited the Marlborough, from whence many of the Enemy were &s;een who might have been de&s;troyed; but the next Evidence who appears (Major Elford) the officer who commanded at the Marlborough, tells the Court without he&s;itation, that he never was re&s;trained from killing his Enemies by this order, and that he fired at all times when he thought proper.</P>

<P>The battery I allude to, was that in front of the Queen's redoubt. Do you know when the ma&s;king wall to that battery was begun?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect whether there was, or not, a heavy fire kept up, upon that wall, as &s;oon as it appeared?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I was ordered, by the Command|ing Officer of Artillery, to fire upon it, with an eight-inch howitzer, for part of two days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect whether there was any fire upon it from the other batteries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One of the two days, in parti|cular, I recollect there was a very heavy fire kept up upon it, from the We&s;t Counter-Guard: the howitzer was in the line of fire from the We&s;t Counter-Guard; which makes me remember it very particularly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect what the effect of that very heavy fire was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can only an&s;wer for the effect of the howitzer; many of the &s;hells from the howitzer &s;unk &s;o deep in the battery, that I did not perceive any ef|fect from them; they appeared to me, at that di&s;tance, to be &s;and-bags.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect what month this firing was in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I imagine, &s;ome time in Decem|ber; I cannot &s;ay po&s;itively.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How many &s;hells did you fire from your howitzer in twenty-four hours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Major Walton ordered me there; I was only there partially, part of either day being &s;ent by the Commanding Officer upon different duty. During the time I was at the howitzer, there were forty or fifty &s;hells fired: there were, I believe, betwixt twenty and thirty &s;hells fired from it in two hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How does this apply to the charge relative to the order of the 15th of October?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Another Member of the Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know the order of the 15th of October continued in force a great while.&mdash;How long was you there at a time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Betwixt two and three hours of a day: I believe I might be there about &s;ix hours in the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did many, or any of the&s;e &s;hells take effect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aid before, &s;everal did go into that battery; but that they &s;unk &s;o deep in the &s;and-bags, that I could not per|ceive any breaches from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were there any other pieces of ordnance on that battery where the howitzer was?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Was, or not, that howitzer brought on purpo&s;e to the <HI>caponire,</HI> to increa&s;e our fire upon that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I carried it up my&s;elf, and po&s;ted it there for that purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did Major Walton continue the fire from that howitzer after you had left it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay, becau&s;e I was &s;ent to other parts of the garri&s;on.&mdash;I left Major Walton at the howitzer when I went from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beg leave to ob&s;erve to the Court, that this evidence is not foreign to the purpo&s;e.&mdash;This order was in force till after the po&s;ition of the Enemy's batteries was known; then there was a fre&s;h order given out, to fire upon tho&s;e batteries, with all po&s;&s;i|ble vigour: the time Mr. Shand has been examined to, was preceding that order.&mdash;I produce this evidence to &s;hew that we were attentive to fire upon ob|jects that were proper to fire at.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There were traver&s;es con&s;tructed acro&s;s the road, a little beyond the Old Ball Court; which prevented any car|riages from pa&s;&s;ing towards the gar|ri&s;on.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Of cour&s;e: if they would pre|vent carriages pa&s;&s;ing towards the Gla|cis, they would towards Stanhope's Tower; for they were on the &s;ame road.</P>

<P>Capt. Don has not &s;aid that: he &s;aid that he did not know when they were erected; but he conjectured they erected them at the time when they formed their line of communi|cation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: they ought fir&s;t to have done it, becau&s;e it would have prevent|ed a <HI>&s;ortie,</HI> from the garri&s;on, upon the road.</P>

<P>Was you ever concerned in any &s;iege before this?</P>
</SP>
<PB N="24" REF="26">
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: the rea&s;on why I &s;aid that was, becau&s;e all the books I have read and &s;tudied, upon the &s;ubject of attack and defence, all of them point out that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In what part of the road was this Ball Court that has been mentioned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Between the hollows: it was about one hundred and fifty yards from where the <HI>arroval</HI> of St. Philip's fromerly &s;tood: I can point the place out upon the plan.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did they &s;tand upon the cre&s;t of the hill, or in the hollows?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the hollows: there was a a pa&s;&s;age, but &s;o &s;mall that I could not turn my hor&s;e in it&mdash;it was with &s;ome difficulty I got through it&mdash;the two traver&s;es were, in fact, a continuation of the line, only leaving a &s;pace for men on foot, or for one hor&s;e, to pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gen. Murray, do you pro|duce this evidence to invalidate the evidence of another witne&s;s, or other|wi&s;e?&mdash;It does not go to the charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I mean to prove, that there could be no carriages upon the road which Capt. Parry de&s;cribed, and which he &s;aid he had fired at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is ju&s;t the rea&s;on of my a&s;king the que&s;tion, becau&s;e that goes to invalidate Capt. Parry's evi|dence: but it does not apply to the charge now under the con&s;ideration of the Court; for the charge is, giving out the order of the 15th of October.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Capt. Parry &s;aid in his evidence, that he was re&s;tricted from firing on carriages upon the road. In an&s;wer to that, I conceive it is now a proper time to &s;hew the Court the impo&s;&s;ibility of carriages being on that road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If it is to contradict Capt. Parry's evidence, then Capt. Parry's evidence &s;hould be read, and be parti|cularly attended to by the Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe Capt. Parry &s;poke what he did not think; but I believe he mi&s;took the place from whence the &s;ound came. Sounds are in the night very deceitful: he might imagine tho&s;e &s;ounds to proceed from the Old Stanhope's Tower Road; therefore all I mean by calling this Evidence, is to &s;hew that Capt. Parry was mi&s;taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then we ought to have reference to Capt. Parry's evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The evidence lies before the Court. The Court are cer|tainly the be&s;t judges of that; but it is natural for me to vindicate my&s;elf, and to give the Court a rea&s;on why I would not &s;uffer an Officer to fire at &s;ounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Captain Parry's main exa|mination was upon the Sixth Article.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think the Sixth and Eighth Articles are &s;o interwoven, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate them: but I beg not to take up a minute's time of the Court about it; I &s;hall be &s;atisfied that you may do as you plea&s;e. I can make no di&s;tinction my&s;elf be|tween the Sixth Article and the Eighth: they are both to the &s;ubject of firing, though they are &s;eparated into di&s;tinct charges. I had &s;couts out every night; and by them I was informed, that the carriages were not upon that road, but behind it, in the barrancas; and at the times the &s;couts were out, it became nece&s;&s;ary to order them not to fire that way. If I am to account for every &s;hot, I am ready to do &s;o, as far as it lies in my power. I beg the Court will excu&s;e me for taking up &s;o much of their time; but I am trying for my reputation, and it is very natural for me to be anxious to take care of it: I have &s;tudied every thing in my power to make the Trial &s;hort.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>THIS and the next Article I withdraw, becau&s;e they &s;tand as part of a charge again&s;t Gen. Murray in a civil capacity: as there is a complaint lodged in a civil Court, I drop it as a military charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir George Howard, as the&s;e two charges affect my honour as a Military Man, and as a Gentleman, I think, in as great a degree as any other that has been exhibited again&s;t me, I do beg it may be inve&s;tigated by this Court, and that their opinion may be given upon it: I &s;hall think my&s;elf much in|jured, indeed, if it is not.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All I have to &s;ay, is, I look upon it as a civil matter, and therefore drop the two charges entirely. The Court will put what interpretation they plea&s;e upon it.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Court has taken the&s;e matters under con&s;ideration, and they have &s;tated two que&s;tions, which they have directed me to propo&s;e to the parties for their information. The fir&s;t is, Is any &s;uit already commenced in any of his Maje&s;ty's ordinary Courts of Judica|ture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do I, relative to tho&s;e two points.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tood Sir William Draper to &s;ay there had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A complaint had been lodged before the Privy Council: that Gentleman, Mr. Sayer, I believe, knows it, and can give an account of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It will &s;till be nece&s;|&s;ary, perhaps, for the Court to be re|&s;olved, whether a pro&s;ecution is going on of any kind; but the other que&s;tion is, If any &s;uit is depending in any of his Maje&s;ty's ordinary Courts of Judicature, the Court wi&s;h to be informed, whether it be a civil action at the &s;uit of the party for damages, or in the nature of a criminal pro&s;ecution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I my&s;elf only know that there was a complaint lodged to his Maje&s;ty's Privy Council while I was in the i&s;land of Minorca; that I know very well, becau&s;e I have here copies of the complaints.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot the Court be &s;atisfied, by &s;ome means, whether there is any proce&s;s going forwards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know. I know that the&s;e were complaints from the inhabitants of the i&s;land, and that Mr. Sayer was concerned for Gen. Murray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There certainly were complaints lodged before the Privy
<PB N="28" REF="30">Council prior to the i&s;land being taken.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Court de&s;ire an an&s;wer to the two que&s;tions the Judge-Advocate has mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know of nothing more than I have mentioned, that there was a complaint to the Privy Council, from the inhabitants of the i&s;land of Minorca, to the&s;e two very articles; and it was for that very rea&s;on I wi&s;hed to drop them.</P>

<P>Both parties, I think, &s;aid they did not know.</P>

<P>I do not know that there is any thing now.</P>

<P>You hear, Gen. Murray, Sir William Draper has &s;aid he does not know there is any thing now; we &s;hall be obliged to you to favour us with a preci&s;e an&s;wer to this que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At this moment I do not believe that there is any pro&s;ecution again&s;t me for tho&s;e two articles of complaint to the Privy Council; becau&s;e, the i&s;land being taken, I imagine the proce&s;s is dropped; and therefore, if I have not an opportunity now of vin|dicating my&s;elf from tho&s;e two accu&s;a|tions, I &s;hall have none whatever of do|ing it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Court has taken this matter under con&s;ideration, and I have received their direction to inform both parties, that, although the matter alledged by the&s;e two articles of charge may be within the cognizance of his Maje&s;ty's ordinary Courts of Judicature, yet, as it does not appear that there is any proce&s;s in any of his Maje&s;ty's or|dinary Courts of Judicature, and as they tend to affect the character of Gen. Murray, they have for the&s;e rea&s;ons, and more e&s;pecially as the Defendant has reque&s;ted that the Court will take cognizance thereof, determined to pro|ceed in the inve&s;tigation of both the ar|ticles of charge.</P>

<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lieut. Gen. <HI>MURRAY</HI> delivered into Court the following Paper, which was read by the <HI>JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT had been u&s;ual in Minorca, for the Officers of the Court of Admi|ralty to &s;ell the prizes condemned in that Court, for which they charged three and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> and other high fees, for holding the money, &amp;c. with|out keeping any regular accounts, where all per&s;ons concerned might have re|cour&s;e, to know the nature, value, and amount of the goods &s;old, and e&s;tabli&s;h their claims on the proceeds accord|ingly.</P>
<P>The Proprietors, and others con|cerned in Privateers, repre&s;ented to me the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing a Public Auctioneer for this purpo&s;e, on the &s;ame footing with the one e&s;tabli&s;hed at Gibraltar, who could give &s;ufficient &s;ecurity, as the Officers at the Admi|ralty Court at Mahon were repre&s;ented by them to be indigent men, and not fit to be tru&s;ted with large &s;ums of money, without &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>It therefore became my duty, as Vice-Admiral, to examine into this matter. I fir&s;t wrote to Gibraltar for information, and regulated the &s;ales and public auctions accordingly, as appears by the proclamations; by which the captors &s;aved two <HI>per cent.</HI> and it has been proved, by one of the Agents, Mr. Arthur Gibbons, who was di&s;&s;atis|fied with the regulation, becau&s;e it ex|po&s;ed his tran&s;actions, that the parties actually &s;aved one <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>In this I imitated the Governor of Gibraltar, who is on the &s;ame footing with the Governor of Minorca, with regard to having a fixed &s;alary, which is to be con&s;idered as the perqui&s;ite of the Vice-Admiral, and not the Gover|nor; and, when the Court looks at my commi&s;&s;ion as Vice-Admiral, and con&s;iders the trouble I had in that de|partment, I am &s;ure they will not think a perqui&s;ite incident to war, and a &s;e|parate office, affecting tran&s;ient people, as any breach of my agreement with Government; e&s;pecially as I had the example of Gibraltar to vindicate my conduct; and when, by &s;uch regula|tion, a very con&s;iderable &s;aving was made to the Captors, and others con|cerned. My Accu&s;er has always called this a duty; but I hope the Court will regard it as a moderate com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Agents and Captors were evi|dently better, in all re&s;pects, under my regulation, and neutral di&s;puted property was &s;ecured and &s;orth-com|ing.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay my Accu&s;er will do me the ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that I very early acquainted him of this perqui&s;ite, and told him I looked upon it as a right to my &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the command; and therefore, if I had had the inclination to give up that right, I did not think I could do it, in ju&s;tice to him. Mr. Bayne, the Auctioneer, will declare he was ordered to lay before Sir William Draper his accounts, that he, Sir Wil|liam, might be thoroughly ma&s;ter of
<PB N="33" REF="35">what he had a right to, if my &s;olici|tations to quit the command had been a&s;&s;ented to: this &s;hews there was no my&s;tery in the affair. The Court, af|ter what I have candidly &s;aid and avowed, are to judge whether the half of the Auctioneer's fees was not a fair and o&s;ten&s;ible perqui&s;ite of the Vice-Admiral of Min$rea and Gibraltar: if I had not thought it &s;uch, I certainly would not have claimed it. I do not think it proper, at pre&s;ent, to &s;ay how I di&s;po&s;ed of it: it is &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;ure the Court, I did not put it into my own pocket.</P>

<P>"<HI>An&s;wers to Mr. Secretary</HI> JOHNSON<HI>'S Queries.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Query</HI> I. WHAT is paid for the Warrant i&s;&s;ued by the Governor to the Admiralty Court; and to whom do the fees belong?</P>
<P>"<HI>An&s;wer.</HI> A Doubloon of fifteen Mex|ico Cobs, paid to the Governor's Secre|tary, at His Excellency's di&s;po&s;al&mdash;the &s;ame fee which we under&s;tand was paid la&s;t war for a like warrant.</P>
<P>"<HI>Query</HI> II. What are the fees of the Court, for i&s;&s;uing the commi&s;&s;ion, condemnation, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.?</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The fees on i&s;&s;uing com|mi&s;&s;ions, it is pre&s;umed, ought, at lea&s;t, to be as much as is paid in Eng|land, which is &s;aid, by &s;ome of tho&s;e who have obtained Letters of Marque there, to co&s;t about Fifteen or Sixteen Guineas. What has been paid at this Office, on this occa&s;ion, is three Qua|druples, be&s;ides what has been paid at the Secretary's Office.</P>
<P>"The Officers of the Vice-Admiralty Courts having no &s;alaries whatever, they are not circum&s;cribed to the fees, on bu&s;ine&s;s that occurs, or may occur; but it is in mo&s;t ca&s;es left to cu&s;tom, and the di&s;cretion of the Officers, to charge for their trouble, according to the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s: and the u&s;age here is, rather to be very mode|rate than otherwi&s;e; but the Court has never been furni&s;hed with a table of fees; neither is it probable they will, unle&s;s the Officers were allowed &s;alaries.</P>
<P>"The fees on condemnation fo prizes is by Act of Parliament limited to Ten Pounds on a ve&s;&s;el under one hundred tons, and Fifteen Pounds on one of one hundred tons, or upwards. Yet it is not rightly known here, how tho&s;e fees, nor tho&s;e on i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;ions, ought to be divided among the Officers of the Court, <HI>viz.</HI> The Judge, Regi&s;trar, and Mar&s;hal. There are, it is true, addi|tional charges in Prize Cau&s;es, for Proc|tors, Tran&s;lators, and Interpreters' fees, which the Court hath no intere&s;t in, and which vary, more or le&s;s, according to the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s. There are al&s;o other fees, on entering claims, &s;e|curities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> particularly with regard to Neutral Ve&s;&s;els; but we are &s;o far unable to give a table of fees for others, that we have found it nece&s;&s;ary to write to our Friends in England, to procure us &s;ome information, with re&s;pect to their bills of co&s;ts there, for our own Government.</P>
<P>"An&s;wered by the Regi&s;trar of the Admiralty-Court.</P>

Prior to this regulation, the Governor's &s;alary aro&s;e from the perqui&s;ites of this Arroval, which were very extraordinary: I complained of it, and would not take them, becau&s;e I thought they were al|ways the cau&s;e of feuds between the Governor and the people, and produced much di&s;order among the Troops; for the more wine they drank, the greater was the Governor's profit; therefore I obtained this e&s;tabli&s;hment, in lieu of tho&s;e perqui&s;ites from the Arroval, and in lieu of them alone.</P>
<P>I took this auction-fee, thinking I had a right to it as Vice-Admiral; and, as I &s;hall an&s;wer to God at the la&s;t day, I did not pocket it, but gave it away, among other things.

<P>The day preceding the order complained of, having ob|&s;erved a large three-ma&s;ted ve&s;&s;el of the Enemy brought down to a Cove near George Town, I ordered the Com|manding Officer of Artillery, who commanded in the Queen's Redoubt, to apply for &s;ome &s;hells in order to try to &s;ink her; they were brought, and applied accordingly: the ve&s;&s;el was &s;unk in con&s;equence; about fourteen &s;hells &s;ent her to the bottom, with all her contents. It was known &s;oon af|terwards that &s;he had twenty-four pieces of cannon on board, be&s;ides many other implements of war. Upon my return to the Ca&s;tle from that &s;ervice, I met Gen. Murray upon the Horn-work, he &s;aid he believed the ve&s;&s;el was &s;unk; I an&s;wered, I hope &s;o. The next day the order of the 15th was i&s;&s;ued. By that order I was deprived of a di&s;cre|tionary power to fire a gun, unle&s;s by leave obtained from the Commanding Officer of the Artillery; although this very order was afterwards privately re|voked in favour of two Captains, who were acting immediately in my depart|ment; which made me conceive the af|front to me more pointed and per&s;onal to me; I complained to the Adjutant Gene|ral, Capt. Don, of the injury done me, and told him I mu&s;t certainly bring the affair before a General Court Martial. Capt. Don informed Gen. Murray of this; but Gen. Murray would not re|voke the order, and the General told me &s;o by letter. I beg Capt. Donne may be called.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that that order was pointed particularly to Sir William Draper; it was a general order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It comprehended me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and &s;o it did the whole Garri&s;on.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I had not, a very few days before, given you my earne&s;t advice as to a po&s;ition the Ge|neral wi&s;hed to have taken on Turk's-Mount &s;ide?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Draper did. On the 9th or 10th of October, Gen. Murray and my&s;elf reconnoitred the ground between the mouth of St. Stephen's Cove and Turk's Mount. At that time, Gen. Murray was of opinion that the Ene|my's battery, which they were con|&s;tructing beyond Turk's Mount, might be annoyed by &s;tone mortars, made in the rocks near the mouth of St. Ste|phen's Cove; in con&s;equence of which, he intended next morning to &s;end a party of Miners to make the&s;e mortars, and a detachment to cover the working party; the po&s;ition that this detach|ment was to take, he pointed out to me. On the evening of the &s;ame day, General Murray de&s;ired me to wait up|on Sir William Draper, and to com|municate to him his intention relative to this bu&s;ine&s;s, and to reque&s;t that he would &s;uperintend the execution of it. Sir William Draper then told me, that he doubted very much of the utility of the mortars in que&s;tion, and that he thought the enterpri&s;e dangerous with re&s;pect to the covering party; but that the next morning, before day-break, he (Sir William) would examine the ground, which he did, and was &s;till of the &s;ame opinion which he enter|tained the preceding evening; all which was communicated to the Governor, and the whole of that enterpri&s;e dropp'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I did not give you my be&s;t advice with regard to the enterpri&s;e at Cape Mola?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t beg Sir William Draper to &s;pecify &s;ome time or place; for I don't immediately recollect it.</P>

<P>When I &s;poke to you on the Horn-work, the evening preceding the attack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>On the evening of the 10th of October, General Murray and Sir Wil|liam Draper were together on the Cur|tain, between the two Horn-works; they continued in conver&s;ation for &s;ome time, and frequently pointed at Cape Mola: (I don't know what the con|ver&s;ation was:) after which they parted, and I think Sir William Draper turned to me, (but in this I am not po&s;itive)
<PB N="41" REF="43">and &s;aid that the way to cut off the Enemy's parties.....</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you po&s;itive that Sir William Draper &s;aid that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot an&s;wer that po&s;itively; I remember he turn'd about to me, and he &s;aid &s;omething about the Enemy's parties and Cape Mola: but what it was I cannot recall to my recollection; for it was a thing of a moment; and, I am &s;ure, not of the lea&s;t con&s;equence at the time; for it has made no im|pre&s;&s;ion on my memory: and if he had &s;aid any thing material, I cer|tainly &s;hould have recollected it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I only wi&s;hed to a&s;k that, to convince every body I had done to the utmo&s;t of my power upon every occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Don.</HI></SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether a general order does not comprehend all indi|viduals?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It certainly does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;aid you look'd upon that order, of the 15th of October, to be a general order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know any thing that gave occa&s;ion to that order of the 15th?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do. The Governor had fre|quently perceived that the young Of|ficers of Artillery had fired at &s;mall par|ties of the Enemy in relieving their po&s;ts and &s;entries, at the di&s;tance from nine hundred to a thou&s;and yards from the Garri&s;on, and likewi&s;e at &s;mall, lit|tle brea&s;t-works, partially rai&s;ed to co|ver the &s;entries, and even at a few men without arms: he &s;aid he judged this firing to be ineffectual, and that it only tended to accu&s;tom the Enemy's troops to fire, and give them courage. The General &s;aid, at that time, that the Ene|my's army he con&s;idered as raw and un|di&s;ciplined, and therefore that it was not our bu&s;ine&s;s to make them brave by firing at them at a di&s;tance. The Ge|neral mentioned &s;everal other circum|&s;tances, which I do not recollect. The General talked much upon this &s;ubject, and frequently in my hearing repri|manded the Artillery Officers upon that &s;ubject. Upon this he founded the order, but I was not pre&s;ent when the order was i&s;&s;ued. One of his motives was with re&s;pect to the ammunition; he &s;aid it was wantonly or u&s;ele&s;sly ex|pended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether the Ene|my's troops work mo&s;t under fire, or when there is no fire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly they work mo&s;t when there is no fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I had made any wanton u&s;e of my command, in firing wantonly or injudiciou&s;ly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay that I ever ob&s;erved it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever ob|&s;erve any marks of in&s;anity in me? I have a rea&s;on for a&s;king that que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Sir William Draper means, have I, &s;ince I have had the ho|nour to be acquainted with him, &s;een any marks of madne&s;s about him: As to incon&s;i&s;tency of conduct&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He did not; he &s;topped me be|fore I had fini&s;hed it, as appears by what you have already read.</P>
</SP>

<P>I de&s;ire Capt. Don may repeat to the Court every word which Sir William Draper &s;aid upon that occa&s;ion, which he de&s;ired him to communicate to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The minute we have was taken down at the time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Don.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When I returned with the me&s;&s;age, the General wrote a letter to Sir William Draper, and inclo&s;ed that minute in it. I wrote down Sir William Draper's me&s;&s;age before I &s;aw the General; and I then delivered it to Gen. Murray, and &s;aid, There is an an&s;wer from Sir William. The General immediately called for a pen and ink, and &s;aid he would write to Sir William on the &s;ubject; and he wrote either that night or next morning to Sir Wil|liam, and &s;ent that paper inclo&s;ed in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The General wi&s;hes you would inform the Court of any thing that pa&s;&s;ed, be&s;ides what you have written down upon that paper.</P>

<P>You are de&s;ired by Gen. Murray to repeat to the Court every word Sir William &s;aid to you at that time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Draper reprobated Gen. Murray's conduct in very har&s;h terms during that conver&s;ation. I thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to communicate that conver&s;ation to Gen. Murray, or any per&s;on; which I never have done. I thought it would have created an opener breach than there then was be|tween the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, and that it was my duty to conceal it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This order was upon the 15th of October; and this is an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s; this is upon the 11th of November. Suppo&s;ing the order im|proper, it could not ari&s;e from any thing &s;ub&s;equent to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I certainly would have revoked the order, when I found it di&s;plea&s;ing to Sir William, had it not been for the har&s;h terms in which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But the Witne&s;s &s;ays, he never communicated that.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When Gen. Murray had read the opinion of the Council of War, he expre&s;&s;ed a very anxious de&s;ire to know what Sir William Draper's opi|nion would be of their ideas. I told him, that, from the critical &s;ituation of things that day, I thought that Sir William Draper would not rea&s;onably object to them. Gen. Murray replied, "Did he ever tell you &s;o?" I &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Sir, &s;ince you are &s;o anxious upon this &s;ubject, I will venture to tell you, in confidence, Sir William has &endq;&s;aid &s;omething like this.</Q> The Ge|neral &s;till &s;eeming anxious to be fur|ther informed, I got up and &s;hut the door, and &s;aid to him, <Q>Sir, as I think &startq;this is a matter of great importance to the King's &s;ervice, to your ho|nour, and that of the garri&s;on, you &s;hould have every information in my power to give you: I will therefore go further, and, confiding in you as a man of honour, who will not be|tray me, I take upon me to &s;how you &s;ome loo&s;e &s;entiments of Sir William Draper's upon this &s;ubject, upon pa|per, &endq;which I have in my pocket.</Q>&mdash;Upon Gen.

<P>The contents of that paper is no &s;ecret now, becau&s;e it was known to every body &s;oon after I returned the paper to Sir William Draper. I took no copy of it; therefore I can't repeat it.</P>
</SP>

<P>Did not the paper ad|vi&s;e, to propo&s;e to the Duc de Crillon a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms for a limited time, and to capitulate upon honourable terms, in ca&s;e no &s;uccours arrived du|ring that limited term?</P>

<P>The paper advi&s;ed nothing; it contained &s;ome ideas relative to that &s;ubject, upon &s;ome certain &s;uppo&s;itions. One day, when I entered Sir William Draper's room, he had &s;everal papers on his table relative to the &s;iege, pro|po&s;ing different &s;orts of methods that would conduce to the King's &s;ervice, con&s;idering the &s;ituation Great-Britain was in at that period: one of them, I think, was, whether it would not be more conducive to the intere&s;ts of England to ri&s;k an a&s;&s;ault, and of the being pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion; as an a&s;&s;ault was an event which at that par|ticular period might be rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;ed to happen &s;oon.

He a&s;ked me <Q>to let him &startq;&endq;&s;ee the paper again,</Q> and &s;eemed very anxious that I &s;hould deliver it up to him. I told him <Q>I was afraid I &startq;had already done too much, and could not give that paper up with|out Sir William Draper's con&s;ent; that I was per&s;uaded Sir William Draper had no ideas that he would be afraid or a&s;hamed to avow, and that he might &s;end to him for that paper or another; and that I believed &endq;Sir William would give it him.</Q> I told Sir William Draper what I had done; who &s;aid to me, <Q>Colonel, &startq;though you meant well in what you have done, yet you will find Gen. &endq;Murray will make a bad u&s;e of it.</Q> He took the paper from me, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;You &s;hall not have it; I will not &endq;tru&s;t him.</Q></P>

<P>I &s;aid, <Q>I was pretty &s;ure that &startq;Sir William Draper would give the &endq;paper, if he was a&s;ked for it:</Q> but I am almo&s;t certain that no &s;uch con|dition was annexed, of Gen. Murray's con&s;enting to the Council of War; and my rea&s;on for being pretty &s;ure it was &s;o, is, that before this period the opinion of the Council of War had been objected to, and the affair was decided.</P>

<P>Certainly: it was the opinion of that Council for him to put them in execution whenever he thought proper; but he had decidedly rejected them before.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lieut. Gen. <HI>MURRAY</HI> delivered into Court the following Paper; which was read by the <HI>JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Court has already heard my rea&s;ons for i&s;&s;uing my order of the 15th of October. I certainly did not mean to aggrieve Sir William Draper by that order. If he conceived it in that light, it was his duty to have &s;tated it to me in a re&s;pectful manner; and I &s;hould certainly have altered it &s;o, as to have given &s;atisfaction to him. On the contrary, I never heard that this order had given the lea&s;t offence to the Lieu|tenant Governor, until the 11th of No|vember, when I &s;ent a me&s;&s;age by Capt. Don, which has been &s;tated in evidence. The contempt with which that me&s;&s;age was received, and the irregular behaviour of Sir William Draper upon the occa|&s;ion, made me write the letter of the 12th of November, which has been produced, together with Sir William's an&s;wer. After this behaviour, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me, without dimini&s;hing my authority, to retract or alter the or|der in que&s;tion, which was &s;trictly mi|litary. I &s;hall, by my corre&s;pondence, prove that it was at all times my inclina|tion to &s;atisfy even the jealou&s;ies of Sir William Draper; and that my in&s;truc|tions were to the Officers of my family to keep us well together, by every at|tention to him. It appears, by &s;ub|&s;equent letters which pa&s;&s;ed between us, that the ideas of Sir William Draper and my&s;elf, concerning our re&s;pective authorities, are very different indeed. Which of us is right, the Court mu&s;t determine, and they will from thence judge where the probable cau&s;e of dif|ference lay. It was impo&s;&s;ible for the Lieutenant Governor to entertain any re&s;pect for me as a man, from the charges he has exhibited again&s;t me. If he &s;aw them in the &s;ame light when the tran&s;|actions were fre&s;h in his memory, as he has &s;ince repre&s;ented them to his Ma|je&s;ty, I apprehend that tho&s;e unju&s;t &s;u&s;|picions, which I have &s;everally di&s;proved, may have &s;o wrought on the mind of Sir William Draper, as to induce him to forget the relative &s;ituation between us, and &s;ink, in his contempt for me, the re&s;pect he owed to his Governor.</P>
<P>At all times, but more e&s;pecially in a Town be&s;ieged, the command of a Go|vernor in a military fortre&s;s is ab&s;olute; and the inferior Officers are not only bound to obey his orders punctually; but they are to do &s;o with chearfulne&s;s, and without &s;hewing di&s;content them|&s;elves, or generating di&s;content in others. On the other hand, a Governor is cer|tainly accountable for the due exerci&s;e of his authority. I declare to this Court, as a man of honour, that if Sir William Draper had accu&s;ed me of murder, I &s;hould not have been more &s;urpri&s;ed than at the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by him and Col. Pringle for i&s;&s;uing that order, name|ly, the &s;kill or good luck of Sir Wil|liam Draper in &s;inking a ve&s;&s;el, by a &s;hell, the day before the order was i&s;|&s;ued. I do declare I never heard of it 'till it appeared in Court; and I am ut|terly at a lo&s;s to conceive how &s;uch an opinion could po&s;&s;ibly be formed, or any &s;uch report prevail in the Garri&s;on, where the truth of any circum&s;tance of that kind was &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;covered; when it was proved by Major Walton, that the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion was &s;unk by &s;hells in con&s;equence of his order.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>DEFENCE to the remaining ARTICLES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Lieut. Gen.</HI> MURRAY <HI>delivered into Court the following Paper, which was read by the</HI> JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</P>
<P>THESE three Articles I mu&s;t con&s;ider together, as the evidence to be pro|duced upon each refers to the whole; and they are by that, and all the other circum&s;tances attending them, compli|cated with each other.</P>
<P>I do not conceive on what circum&s;tance Sir William Draper founds this fir&s;t part of the&s;e Articles, namely, <Q>that of &startq;charging him (Sir William Draper) with an attempt to take the command &endq;from the Governor.</Q></P>
<P>In my letter to Sir William Draper, of the 16th of January, where I was rea|&s;oning upon a &s;pecies of prote&s;t he had &s;ent to me, in his fir&s;t letter of the &s;ame date, again&s;t certain di&s;po&s;itions, which I had thought fit and nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;ituation; (after &s;tating my rea&s;oning in an&s;wer to Sir William Draper on the &s;ubject) <Q>I &s;ay every attempt to take &startq;the command from me will be inef|fectual.&endq;</Q> By this &s;entence, it is evi|dent I do not charge Sir William with an actual; direct attempt to take the com|mand from me: but I fairly in&s;inuate, that I think there appears a tendency to abridge my authority; and I therefore declare, by a proper warning, that all &s;uch attempts will prove vain, and have no effect. And the &s;ub&s;equent letter of Sir William Draper to me, dated al&s;o the 16th of January, will &s;ufficiently &s;hew that, with regard to the &s;aid ten|dency
<PB N="53" REF="55">and di&s;po&s;ition, I did not judge ami&s;s; for I humbly apprehend this &s;econd letter is a real attempt to a|bridge my authority. But of all tho&s;e matters, the evidence being in wri|ting, the Court mu&s;t judge from the corre&s;pondence between the Accu&s;er and the Governor. As to &s;uper&s;eding the Lieutenant-Governor without &s;uf|ficient cau&s;e; this, likewi&s;e, the Court will be enabled to judge of by the be&s;t evidence po&s;&s;ible, that of our letters at the time.&mdash;The truth is, Sir William Draper &s;uper&s;eded him&s;elf, by a con|duct not only unmilitary, but fretful and capricious.&mdash;The extreme conceit of his own talents made him believe they placed him above the King's com|mi&s;&s;ion; and, though I am ready to admit he has very con&s;iderable parts, yet I as freely confe&s;s they never &s;truck me as &s;ufficient to admit any &s;uperio|rity on a military &s;ubject, even if we had been placed as equals, and much le&s;s &s;o where the re&s;pon&s;ibility lay with me as Governor,&mdash;being confirmed in a belief that I was at all times fully ju&s;tified in the di&s;charge of my duty, if I acted to the utmo&s;t of my own ability and judgement, without being forced to a&s;k the advice of other Offi|cers, unle&s;s I &s;hould fee it proper &s;o to do; and that every attempt to oblige me to call a Council of War was con|trary to good di&s;cipline.&mdash;I do not deny, that Councils of War are of|ten proper and advantageous; but they can only be &s;o when they are a&s;|&s;embled at the &s;pontaneous de&s;ire of the Commander in Chief.&mdash;The con|trary doctrine is maintained by Sir William Draper:&mdash;And this is a point of difference between us, on which the Court will determine.</P>
<P>The la&s;t charge is artfully put. I can neither admit nor deny the fact as it is &s;tated: I cannot allow that ever I &s;aid, that Sir William Draper advi&s;ed me to &s;urrender the place &s;ooner than I did; but I aver and affirm this, that Sir William Draper, then Lieutenant-Governor of Minorca, re&s;iding in the Fortre&s;s of St. Philip's, then be&s;ieged by an Army under the Duc de Crillon, of which Fortre&s;s James Murray was Governor, did deliver a paper to Col. Pringle, then an Officer in the Gar|ri&s;on, dated the 14th of January, 1782, purporting to be the opinion of the &s;aid Sir William Draper, That, con&s;i|dering the weak &s;tate of the Garri&s;on, and the great force of the Enemy, it were better to &s;end and propo&s;e a Ce&s;&s;ation of Ho&s;tilities to the Duc de Crillon, and to make conditional terms of &s;urrender at a certain time, if no relief &s;hould ar|rive before the period agreed upon; the contents of which &s;aid paper were circulated in the Garri&s;on, and &s;tated as the advice of Sir William Draper to a Council of War a&s;&s;embled the 18th day of January by my order, and was the occa&s;ion of inducing &s;ome of the Officers who compo&s;ed the &s;aid Coun|cil of War to &s;ign another paper, gi|ving the &s;aid advice to me of propo|&s;ing a Ce&s;&s;ation of Ho&s;tilities, and a conditional &s;urrender to the Duc de Crillon.&mdash;This is all I ever a&s;&s;erted on the &s;ubject, and the&s;e facts I am ready to prove. The fair, ju&s;t, and obvious inference to be drawn from them, I maintain, is, that Sir William Draper, Knight of the Bath, Lieutenant-Ge|neral of his Maje&s;ty's Forces, and Lieu|tenant-Governor of Minorca, was for agreeing on Terms of Capitulation &s;ooner than I did; which mu&s;t have produced the final &s;urrender of the Fort before the period when I &s;ubmitted,
<PB N="54" REF="56">even under the &s;ickne&s;s which after|wards prevailed among the Troops: and neverthele&s;s this &s;ub&s;equent &s;urren|der by me, under tho&s;e unfore&s;een ca|lamities, and &s;anctified by the unani|mous opinion of all the principal Offi|cers, is &s;tated as a heavy charge of cri|minal accu&s;ation by the very man who fir&s;t &s;tarted and afterwards propagated the opinion among the principal Offi|cers under my command, that we ought to have a&s;ked for a Ce&s;&s;ation of Ho&s;ti|lities, and conditional Terms of Capi|tulation, from the Duc de Crillon, twenty days before we &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that Sir William Draper, on propo&s;ing the conditional article re&s;pecting the relief, would have a&s;ked for a longer period than pa&s;&s;ed between the propo&s;al and my &s;urren|der; but the hi&s;tory of Forts and Towns when be&s;ieged and beginning to parley, and the &s;ituation of our Garri&s;on and that of the Enemy, will enable the Court to judge whether it is po&s;&s;ible to believe, from the nature of the ca&s;e, we could have obtained above ten days. I declare that the ut|mo&s;t time I ever heard mentioned, at the moment the advice was given to me, when I cen&s;ured the opinion in my letter to the Officers of the Coun|cil of War, was fourteen days.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way of defending a Gar|ri&s;on is never to think, much le&s;s to talk, of &s;urrendering it, until circum|&s;tances make it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of a con|trary conduct is of the wor&s;t con&s;e|&s;equences: and upon this point the Court will judge between me and the advice I received from the Council of War promoted by Col. Pringle upon the opinion of Sir William Draper, whether my conduct, or following their opinion, would have been mo&s;t beco|ming the character of an old Soldier, and the honour of his Maje&s;ty's arms.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell exactly what day it was, but it was before the 17th. I heard it was Sir William Draper's idea, That, con&s;idering the &s;ituation the place and the garri&s;on were in at that time, it might be advi&s;eable to propo&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, for a certain time, to the Duc de Crillon; and that, if no relief came to the garri&s;on during that time, the place was to be &s;urrendered upon the mo&s;t honourable terms.</P>

<P>Did you gather, from the conver&s;ation, what the contents of the paper were?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Partly I did: it appeared to me, that the paper contained Sir Wil|liam Draper's ideas of the &s;ituation of the fortre&s;s, and the &s;tate of the garri|&s;on; and, from the reduced &s;tate of both, that he, Sir William Draper, was of opinion, that the Governor &s;hould immediately propo&s;e to the Duc de Crillon a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for a fixed period, at the expiration of which the garri&s;on &s;hould capitulate upon the be&s;t terms that we could get.</P>

<P>Do you know whether Col. Pringle did wait upon Sir William Draper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he did; becau&s;e he returned that forenoon to Gen. Murray. He went into Gen. Murray's private apartment. After Col. Pringle was gone, Gen. Murray &s;aid to me, "Col. Pringle has waited upon Sir William Draper, to reque&s;t the paper may be put into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion:" and he &s;aid the an&s;wer was, "Sir William Draper had no objection to put the paper into Gen.

<P>If the que&s;tion is unexceptionable, I don't know that there is any harm in informing a Wit|ne&s;s, that he is to be examined to this or that point; but if the que&s;tion be a

<P>Were the que&s;tions which have been propo&s;ed to you, previou&s;ly concerted between you and Gen. Murray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly Gen. Murray ac|quainted me that he would examine me to tho&s;e points; and I &s;aw the que&s;tions previous to coming into Court. I under&s;tood it was legal, for the opinion of the lawyers had been a&s;ked upon that &s;ubject; they &s;aid it was, but by no means that we &s;hould tell Gen. Murray what our an&s;wers would be: and therefore, without he&s;itation, I read the que&s;tions over and over again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But were the que&s;tions con|certed between you and Gen. Murray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: Gen. Murray a&s;ked me if tho&s;e que&s;tions were proper to the point; and they were framed to the point in que&s;tion by Gen. Murray and me. I had minutes of the whole tran&s;action taken down at the moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There was an affi|davit made by Capt. Don before the Judge-Advocate, in the Fort, relative to this bu&s;ine&s;s: I a&s;ked a Coun&s;el if that affidavit could be received in evi|dence, in this Court: he &s;aid, No, but we mu&s;t frame the que&s;tions &s;o as to bring before the Court the &s;ub&s;tance of that affidavit. The que&s;tions were framed accordingly; and I have here the affidavit, if the Court wi&s;h to &s;ee it. I &s;aw my reputation was at &s;take, and I therefore took the&s;e precautions to authenticate the fact, in ca&s;e either of us died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I thought Gen. Murray told us in this bu&s;ine&s;s he had no profe&s;&s;ional aid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have no profe&s;&s;ional aid in this bu&s;ine&s;s: I a&s;ked Mr. Er|&s;kine that &s;imple que&s;tion; and as to any aid in my defence, my &s;tyle is pretty well known in the world, they may judge whether it is mine or not: I did not a&s;k any of Sir William Dra|per's Witne&s;&s;es if they had &s;een any of the que&s;tions they were to an&s;wer.&mdash; Witne&s;&s;es &s;hould, in my opinion, know what que&s;tions will be propo&s;ed, before they come into Court; otherwi&s;e I have &s;een in&s;tances where they are over-awed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>I had it in my hand.&mdash;Such a paper as that, I, as Governor, had a right to keep; and if I had done my duty, I &s;hould have put you in arre&s;t: I a&s;k pardon of my King and Country for not doing it, which was the greate&s;t crime I committed.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>From Gen.</HI> Murray <HI>to Sir</HI> William Draper, <HI>Sept.</HI> 25, 1781.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the Enemy's proceedings hitherto, it may be imagined they do not mean to attack the place by regular approaches; in|deed, as they may de&s;troy our defences without any great ri&s;que to them&s;elves, and that there is not the lea&s;t appearance of any attempt to avail them&s;elves of the advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;s to erect batteries for that purpo&s;e, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed their intention is to a&s;&s;ault and take the place by &s;urpri&s;e; of cour&s;e, our fir&s;t at|tention &s;hould be to provide again&s;t &s;uch an in&s;ult. The vicinity of the Governor's Bar|ranca, and the little protection from the works we can give to the Glacis and Outward Covered Way betwixt the S. W. Lunette and the Caro|lina, mu&s;t encourage an attack from that quar|ter; I mean, from the Governor's Barranca. <HI>Query,</HI> What can now be contrived, in addition to what is already done, to &s;ecure us there? Would a Gra&s;shopper or two placed on the We&s;t face of the Outward Covered Way, to fire upon the column of attack, which naturally would march upon the produced capital of the Carolina, a&s;&s;i&s;t? Would another be u&s;eful, in annoying this attack, if placed in the S. W. face of the Outward Covered Way of the Ca|rolina? And, for a further protection to the Carolina, would another be well po&s;ted in the S. W. face of the Outward Covered Way of the We&s;t Lunette? Will one in the N. W. face of the Outward Covered Way of the We&s;t Lunette, to fire on the capital of the Kane, be of utility?</P>
<P>As the Enemy, if they intend to carry the place by a general a&s;&s;ault, will nece&s;&s;arily pu&s;h at our vitals, they will vigorou&s;ly attack the Inner Covered Way at the &s;ame in&s;tant they attack the Outward one and the Lunettes. Our inferior numbers invite them to embrace this idea. May not the Inner Covered Way be &s;trengthened by the remaining Gra&s;shoppers? I mean, tho&s;e not po&s;ted in the Lunettes; for certainly the&s;e cannot be placed to greater ad|vantage than where they are. I judge it would be more difficult to pu&s;h into the body of the place, covered by the Kane, Queen, and An|&s;truther, than by the attack upon the Engli&s;h line; but I think a pu&s;h made betwixt the We&s;t Lunette and the Kane &s;hould be provided again&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible; the arch-way under the new work &s;hould be blocked up without delay. Will it be proper to erect a brea&s;t-work of bar|rels, filled with earth, high enough to protect the men employed in managing the Gra&s;shop|pers in the circular Barbet battery, in the rear of the Kane; or will a Barbet gun there an&s;wer the purpo&s;e as well?</P>
<P>The Sea Line is defended only by the flank|ing guns on that line; the guard, &amp;c. at the new place of arms, which, with the piquet, will con&s;i&s;t of only eighty-two mu&s;queteers, ten of which are &s;entries, who, in ca&s;e of a general alarm, mu&s;t &s;tick to their po&s;ts, can afford no protection to that line, but the fire from the place of arms. Can any thing be thought of for the better &s;ecurity of that line? If any guards of mu&s;queteers are judged nece&s;|&s;ary, they mu&s;t be compo&s;ed of the &s;eamen taken from the batteries in the Ca&s;tle, the Country-wards, and Ravelines; which batteries cannot be allowed to act, in the &s;uppo&s;ition of a night-attack upon the outward line. Charles-Fort, in the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, although a Becoyeu, will be of great utility, when the block-hou&s;e to be made at the corn-&s;tore on the Cumberland is fini&s;hed, which I wi&s;h to be done as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, together with the block-hou&s;e and pal|li&s;ading at the top of the Burying-ground: we are as &s;ecure there as our number will allow us to be; at lea&s;t, I can think of nothing we can do, at this time, to make us more &s;o; nor can I &s;ugge&s;t any further &s;ecurity for the Sea Line, towards St. Stephen's Cove, betwixt Charles-Fort
<PB N="57" REF="63">and the South Lunette; which South Lu|nette mu&s;t take e&s;pecial and ob&s;tinate care of it&s;elf, in the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e: luckily the under|ground communications from it to the body of the place are well mined, and may be ea&s;ily defended.</P>
<P>There are thirteen &s;ix-pounder carronades, and three of eighteen pounds. <HI>Query,</HI> May not they be properly employed in &s;trengthening the Sea Line, or the Inner Covered Way, or &s;ome of them placed &s;o as to act in the &s;alient angles of the Redoubts and Counter-guards? N. B. If it is judged expedient to place any of the Gra&s;shoppers in the Outward Covered Way, they may, in ca&s;e of an alarm, be manned by the &s;entries in the Outward Covered Way, and a detachment of Artillery from the Lunettes, or rather as many of that corps as may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them, to be po&s;ted in the Lunettes every night, that there may be no diminution from the &s;trength of the guns in the Lunette.</P>
<P><HI>Query,</HI> If the two Gra&s;shoppers propo&s;ed to be placed &s;o as to play upon the produced capitals of the S. W. and Caroline Lunettes, were put in the Old Covered Way, betwixt the&s;e two Lunettes, would &s;uch a po&s;ition an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>Capt. Law&s;on, with a reinforcement to the Monarca's crew, will take the Guards in the Ca&s;tle and &s;ubterranean communications from the main ditch; he &s;ays, he can be an&s;werable for them: indeed, I think he may; as &s;eamen are accu&s;tomed to the idea of being put to clo&s;e quarters, and of defending them.</P>
<P>It would be very proper, if every Officer in the garri&s;on was in&s;tructed what he is to do in every contingent event. Tho&s;e appointed for &s;hutting the doors, and putting out the lamp, in the communications, &s;hould be named, and &s;hould every night lie on their po&s;ts, with the men appointed for that parti|cular duty; who, no doubt, will be tru&s;ty in|valids, equal to perform it. If prudence would admit to exerci&s;e the regiments in taking up their po&s;ts, and altering their po&s;ition as cir|cum&s;tances might happen, it would be right to do it; but the de&s;ertions which have happened, and the pro&s;pect of more, forbid that idea, le&s;t the Enemy &s;hould know our re&s;ources.</P>
<P>Capt. Mayne, I am confident, may be relied on; his part in the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;cene is an active and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential one: indeed, our pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation requires all the vigilance, patience, and fortitude, of every one of us. Two traver&s;es are propo&s;ed by Col. Brew&s;e, to be (as I &s;up|po&s;e) defended by mu&s;quetry; but, alas! we have not mu&s;queteers to defend more e&s;&s;ential objects.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have been plea&s;ed to give me your paper to con&s;ider upon, I take this liberty to acquaint you, that I do not think it nece&s;|&s;ary to place any more Gra&s;shoppers in the Out|ward Covered Way, judging that the number in the &s;everal Lunettes is fully &s;ufficient to de|fend the Glacis, and the Covered Ways re&s;pec|tively flanked by them. I am of your opinion, that the remainder may be very properly di&s;|po&s;ed of in the Inner Covered Way, and &s;o placed as to play in the Enemy's columns, &s;hould a de&s;perate attempt be made to ru&s;h in between the &s;everal Lunettes, and to force our places of arms. The artillery of the inner works &s;eems to me of very little &s;ervice in <HI>night</HI> attacks, e&s;pecially if the Enemy can join our troops &s;tationed in the Inner Covered Way and places of arms; therefore the Gra&s;shoppers in the Inner Covered Way may be the pre&s;erva|tion of the place, by their repeated di&s;charges on the advancing Grenadiers.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that a very u&s;eful &s;tockade may be planted between the S. W. Lunette and Caroline; as the di&s;tance between their ditches is little more than fifty yards: the old tough &s;hip-timber is more difficult to cut through than the palli&s;ades, and I believe there is a very &s;ufficient quantity for the above-mentioned pur|po&s;e. Your ob&s;ervations on the parts by which an Enemy might penetrate, &s;eem perfectly ju&s;t; but I think the Enemy's pu&s;h between the Kane and We&s;t Lunette ably and greatly provided again&s;t by the new work. As an additional &s;e|curity, three Gra&s;shoppers may be placed in the Inner Covered Way, and in the right face of the We&s;t Counter-guard; and, as the Inner Covered Way on the &s;ide is &s;o much higher than the Outward, it will command and &s;cour all the Glacis on the left face of the Kane; and the Gra&s;shopper and three guns in the new work will effectually rake the Glacis and Co|vered Way on the right face of the We&s;t Lu|nette. I am of opinion, likewi&s;e, that the carronades may be brought into good u&s;e, for an additional Defence of the Sea Line. I think your ideas and projects, for the defence of the &s;ubterreins, perfectly ju&s;t; and will do all in my power to carry them into execution.</P>

<P>LIEUT. GEN. Murray pre&s;ents his re&s;pects to Sir William Draper; he means, by the Out-line, all the defences beyond the In|ner Covered Way, viz. Lunettes, Mines, Fou|ga&s;&s;es, Stone Mortars, &amp;c. Sir William's de|finition of the Out-works comprehends the whole of this Fortification, which con&s;i&s;ts only of Out-works, inner and outward, with regard to the old Ca&s;tle; of cour&s;e, Sir William mu&s;t have imagined Gen. Murray had dive&s;ted him|&s;elf of the command of the place, from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in him&s;elf, which is by no means the ca&s;e. He certainly did, when he left the Fort la&s;t &s;ummer, beg of Sir William Draper to put the place in the be&s;t &s;tate of defence he could, and to endeavour to execute what had been projected betwixt Sir William and him&s;elf. Lieut. Gen. Murray will for ever think him|&s;elf obliged to Sir William for his exertions; he would be happy now to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with his advice, as would likewi&s;e the Chief Engineer; but 'tis uncommon for a Governor to have works carrying on, when he is pre&s;ent upon the &s;pot, without his knowledge. Lieut. Gen. Murray would have been much obliged to Sir William Draper, if he had explained to him the utility of the traver&s;e in que&s;tion; which, at this moment, neither he nor the Chief En|gineer can &s;ee: but they &s;ee it would impede a gun, which was placed in the new work, for the defence of that branch of the Covered Way, and of cour&s;e a great protection to the guard in the place of arms, which Sir William &s;o ably projected for the defence of the &s;tairs lead|ing from thence to the ditch of the N. W. O. Ravelin. They think the carronade to be fixed in the palli&s;ades of the Covered Way, where the traver&s;e was to have been made, will be a better protection to the frieze of the new work, than the few men which might have been po&s;ted there for the purpo&s;e with their mu&s;quets.</P>

<P>SIR William Draper pre&s;ents his be&s;t re&s;pects to his Excellency; and, in an&s;wer to his que&s;tion, takes the liberty to inform him, that he judges fifty for the South Lunette, &s;ixty for the S.

At the South Lunette is unconnected with the others, he thinks a Captain and fifty nece&s;&s;ary there. As the &s;ubterraneans of the South-We&s;t, and We&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure protect tho&s;e of the Carolina, he gives more to them than to that work. The circum&s;tances of the defence mu&s;t depend &s;o much upon the nature of the Ene|my's attack, that it is very difficult to be pre|ci&s;e upon the &s;ubject: if the formality of a &s;iege takes place, and a breach be made in any of the Lunettes, he pre&s;umes, that if a deter|mination is made to defend it, the number mu&s;t vary accordingly. Again&s;t a <HI>coup de main</HI> only, he is not for ri&s;king more than he has mentioned on the out-line, &amp;c. He judges a Captain nece&s;&s;ary for the South-We&s;t, and al&s;o the We&s;t; and an old Lieutenant for the Carolina: the other Officers in the u&s;ual proportion; and one Field-Officer to the three Lunettes which are connected together. He thinks the Pantoon intrenchment and the Ho&s;pital Line can only be defended from the works which re&s;pectively command them.</P>

<P>COL. PRINGLE thinks the Garri|&s;on of the Marlborough needful to enable us to defend the other works; of cour&s;e, that the Marlborough &s;hould be blown up. For my own part, I &s;ee a number of &s;trong objections to this mode of reinforcement: it is true, we are very defective in fuzileers; but, as &s;oon as our cannon are intirely &s;ilenced, we &s;hall be reinforced, in our defences with &s;mall arms, with the Marine Corps, who, at lea&s;t, may take all the labour, and leave every &s;oldier to do the duty with arms. I never was ob&s;tinate, and therefore wi&s;h, if agreeable to you, to &s;ub|mit Col. Pringle's propo&s;ition relative to the Marlborough to your con&s;ideration and opi|nion; and, if you think proper to con&s;ult with Gen. De Sydow, Col. De Lin&s;ing, Col. Ack|lom, and Col. Brew&s;e, upon it, I can have no objection. In the mean time, I think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to remark, that we are not yet arrived to the proper &s;tage of the &s;iege to abandon the Marlborough intirely. If it &s;hall be thought expedient to blow it up before we have di&s;puted the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it with the Enemy, a &s;maller Garri&s;on than the pre&s;ent may &s;uffice; if you think &s;o, I &s;hall chearfully dimini&s;h it, to re|inforce us on this &s;ide. If my ideas of the E|nemy's intentions are well founded, I judge the Marlborough may be of great importance to us. My ideas are founded upon the intelli|gence I have had, that the Duc de Crillon, from the apprehen&s;ions of his army, does not mean to &s;torm this place, until by his miners he can render our defences below ground as feeble as he, with eighty-&s;ix pieces of cannon, and thirty-&s;ix mortars, can our defences above. The &s;ap they are now pu&s;hing from the Water-Tower points out &s;omething like this.&mdash;It may be done with a view only of approaching us on that quarter, to &s;et their miners to work: they are already too near from the Great Barranca and the Gallows. The Marlborough will give more annoyance on that &s;ide than the Argyll, Queen, and An&s;truther, in the &s;tate they &s;oon mu&s;t be reduced to, can give from the Water-Tower. I candidly, Sir, give you my no|tions, and will with confidence &s;ubmit them to you, and the Officers I have mentioned, if
<PB N="60" REF="66">you judge it proper to a&s;&s;emble them; but, if you do not think &s;uch a parade nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall be very happy to have your own opi|nion only, which I do a&s;&s;ure you ever had, and ever will have, a very deci&s;ive weight with me.</P>

The Enemy's grand attack is &s;o forcibly de|clared on the Queen, the N. W.

It is al&s;o my opinion that the Enemy will not wait for the fatal effects of our great mines without the Queen and Kane; nor do I believe they will erect any Batteries on the crate of the Glacis of either work.

<P>I THINK that the Covered Way immediately on the right of the place of arms, before the North Horn-work, is a better po&s;t than the place of arms it&s;elf; as there is room to act in; and the little po&s;t, where the two guns are placed, is a mo&s;t excellent po&s;ition to &s;upport it on the right. The guns in the lower part of the North Horn-work, which &s;cours the Covered Way on the right of the N. W. Outward Raveline, are &s;till &s;erviceable, and ought to be manned, and u&s;ed. The fir&s;t po&s;t to be maintained, in my opinion, is the little place of arms in the rear of the Kane; whe|ther the attack is made between the Kane and the We&s;t Lunette, or the Kane and the Queen's Redoubt, and Officer and twenty men &s;hould maintain that po&s;t; and the two Gra&s;shoppers, the one in the traver&s;e, and the other in the work it&s;elf, &s;hould be manned and u&s;ed. There are &s;everal guns on the right face of the N. W. Outward Raveline in good condition for firing; the guns on the right flank of the Kane are perfectly good. Should the Enemy attempt to penetrate through the Kane and the Queen's, almo&s;t all the guns on the left of the works (that is) from the left face of the We&s;t to Charles Fort, have &s;uffered very little, and, I am of opinion, &s;hould be fully prepared. If the Enemy attacks us &s;eriou&s;ly on this or any other night, his own fire of guns and mortars mu&s;t cea&s;e, when &s;everal of our guns, although too feeble to re&s;i&s;t his Batteries, may be u&s;ed with grape to de&s;troy his Troops when ap|proaching to, or when in our Covered Way, or even places of arms: therefore I am by no means for placing the &s;eamen in the &s;ubter|reins; I think they will do us more &s;ervice in being &s;tationed in the places I have mentioned, to u&s;e the great guns, under their proper Offi|cers, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ours. I have no doubt but the Electoral Troops, aided by &s;uch able and brave Officers, will do their utmo&s;t for his Maje&s;ty's and their own glory:&mdash;they have &s;tudied their parts of the intended attack upon us. I do not pre&s;ume to alter any thing but the little I have mentioned.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think, as you do, that every gun that can be fired mu&s;t do its duty in ca&s;e of an a&s;&s;ault. They are all loaded with grape, and have the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply of ammunition for &s;uch an event. Fire-balls, of both dimen&s;ions, are lodged in the advanced works. I wi&s;h to have guns left us to re&s;i&s;t an attack. Surely no man can imagine our guns that act (all which I know perfectly well) are to be idle on &s;uch an occa&s;ion: they will be all &s;toutly manned, and well &s;upplied, without the aid of the Sea Cap|tains, appointed to the &s;ubterraneans.</P>
<P>I think, with regard to the Hanoverian di&s;|po&s;ition, that it is a very &s;oldier-like one: it &s;hould not be altered, as they like it. Had I made it, there would have been more men in the Inner Covered Way, to retreat to the po&s;ts mentioned in their di&s;po&s;ition, where I would have po&s;ted cool Officers and men to cover their retreat, as we have done in the Briti&s;h line. I do not think, that even the Inward Covered Way is to be, or can be, with our number, ob&s;tinately defended: the places of arms mu&s;t.

<P>I A&s;&s;ure you there never was an idea of taking a man from Charles Fort, Capt. Blakeney excepted. He, Capt. Harman and Crawford, with Capt. Hewi&s;on, were judged &s;teady men to take the charge of the commu|nication from the main ditch, and the nece&s;&s;ary number of &s;eamen, which could be &s;pared from the interior &s;ilenced guns: but as it is with dif|ficulty to get men enough for the guns we can &s;till u&s;e on the defen&s;ive, I have left the &s;ailors for the guns, but po&s;ted the Captains Harman, Hewi&s;on, and Crawford, in the communica|tion. I wi&s;h I could give them &s;eamen, and the poor battalions, to be as &s;trong as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I am afraid the Prince of Wales's Battery is no longer tenable. De&s;troyed as it is, an im|mediate and too &s;afe an atrack may be appre|hended. If the troops po&s;ted there are attack|ed, and obliged to retreat, the Enemy may fol|low them pell-mell: the con&s;equences would be unplea&s;ant; indeed they might be no le&s;s than cutting off the communication with the Lunettes Will it not, therefore, be advi&s;e|able to withdraw from thence, and take po&s;t in the N. W. outward raveline, and We&s;t counter|guard? The&s;e places are repairable by cantoon-bunkets, and &s;and-bags, to heighten the para|pets where mo&s;t hurt. If this plan takes place, the communication to the bottom of the &s;tair|ca&s;e mu&s;t then be blocked up &s;ecurely. I &s;hall be very happy, Sir, to have your opinion of this matter. Boxes of grenades may be placed in the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and fired from a train below. I wi&s;h we may not &s;oon be reduced to do this, or &s;omething like it, with all our &s;tairs. It is to be lamented they were not all made bomb|proof: but who could have imagined that 178 pieces of cannon, and forty-&s;even mortars, of the large&s;t calibre, would have been brought to pulveri&s;e this wretched hole, defended by 1400 invalids, and 600 &s;eamen and others? The Duc de Crillon, I think, may roar and pound with his artillery; he mu&s;t u&s;e other in&s;truments to reduce us to extremity. He is as &s;uperior to us in miners, as in weighty metal: I judge, for that rea&s;on, he will, when the weather per|mits, endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf at Charles Fort and the Marlborough, and attach his miners on this &s;ide St. Stephen's Cove. This mode will be tedious, it is true; it is &s;uch a one that neither you nor I would probably have adopted, had we been in his &s;ituation; but he has raw troops, is not an oeconomi&s;t in ammu|nition, and perhaps has orders not to ri&s;que a general a&s;&s;ault. I candidly give you my notions of our &s;ituation, and am very confident, for the good of the &s;ervice of our Ma&s;ter, and the ho|nour
<PB N="62" REF="68">of the arms of our country, you will fa|vour me with yours, which I once more a&s;&s;ure you has great weight with me.</P>
<P>Col. Brew&s;e told me ye&s;terday, you wi&s;hed to have the mines on the Glacis loaded: they were once &s;o, but drawn again at the de&s;ire of Col. Brew&s;e, who declared, if the&s;e mines were loaded, we were deprived from countermining the Enemy. If their plan was to attack us under ground, he &s;aid our mines could never be looked upon in any other light than Galleries de Coute; as they were too advanced from the crate of the Covered Way to over&s;et the Ene|my's batteries erected there. This is now out of the que&s;tion; and I mo&s;t chearfully con&s;ent to their being loaded, and fired when you think proper. I think, however, as I am told you do, that this will be an operation of <HI>&eacute;clat,</HI> ra|ther than of utility. I have &s;et on this day the miners to charge the mines in the &s;ubterranean communications. I dare &s;ay you will think it high time to pu&s;h that nece&s;&s;ary work: a few days will fini&s;h it: but if you are impatient to have the mines in the Outward Covered Way loaded, the company may be divided, and em|ployed in both.</P>

<P>I Have had the honour of your letter; in an&s;wer to which, I take the liberty to in|form you that I was ever, and am now, of an opinion that a Coupare &s;hould be made acro&s;s the place of arms, called the Prince of Wales's Battery, to defend the approach to the draw|bridge on the one fide, and the communication from below on the other. There are large bar|rels in the N. N. W. Outward Raveline: the&s;e, at pre&s;ent, are all taken up to cover the mor|tars in that work; but I think many of them may be &s;pared, and with their contents form &s;ome defence for the place of arms. If nothing of this &s;ort can be effected, the po&s;t is undoubt|edly weak, for want of a ditch before it; which I have often lamented the want of, fore&s;eeing the inconveniency; as al&s;o knowing that it would do little as a battery, and be totally ex|po&s;ed to a mo&s;t heavy fire, which would de&s;troy all the pali&s;ades before it, as they were &s;o un|luckily placed. However, as things now are, we mu&s;t look forward. If no defence is made in the &s;pot, the Covered Way on the right and left of it mu&s;t be abandoned likewi&s;e, becau&s;e it depended on the place of arms for its <HI>flank fire,</HI> and a retreat, if its defenders were re|pul&s;ed: &s;o that the whole front between the We&s;t Counter-guard, and N. W. Outward Ra|veline, is laid bare of &s;upport but from the&s;e works only. I mu&s;t own I think it is &s;acri|ficing too much at once. All the Fouga&s;&s;es near it may certainly be loaded in the night, which will give it additional &s;ecurity. If it be thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to abandon it, the &s;tair-ca&s;e mu&s;t undoubtedly be taken away; but I mu&s;t own, I am no friend to the boxes of grenades placed at the bottom, as an unfor|tunate &s;hell may do much mi&s;chief by their aid.</P>

<P>I Find, by your di&s;po&s;ition, that the Inner Covered Way, and the places of arms which &s;hould be its protection, are to be given up, and the troops de&s;tined for its defence withdrawn. The re&s;olution is very &s;erious, and de&s;erves attention; and, in my humble opinion, <HI>recon&s;ideration;</HI> becau&s;e, Sir, if the Inner Covered Way is given up, what fire is there to check the Enemy when advancing be|tween the Lunettes, when they are attacked by their Gorges? The&s;e Lunettes mu&s;t owe their pre&s;ervation, if they are attacked, to the an|noyance and lo&s;s the Enemy mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain from the fire poured in from our Inner Covered Way. The mi&s;erable fire of ten or twelve men, &s;ta|tioned in the Gorges of the out-works, is of <HI>little moment;</HI> therefore, if the fire of the inner line is removed, all is lo&s;t. I &s;hould never, Sir, have thought my&s;elf equal to the defence of the outline, unle&s;s I had flattered my&s;elf with a certainty of &s;upport from the inner: that &s;up|port being withdrawn, I confe&s;s my&s;elf une|qual to the ta&s;k, and by no means re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>

<P>GEN. De Sydow, the Colonels, Lieute|nant-Colonels, the Chief and Second Engineers, and the Commanding Of|ficer of Artillery (Lieutenant-Colonel Walton), are intreated by the Governor to con&s;ider what follows, and to give their opinions at large, in writing, upon every con&s;ideration Our &s;ituation is critical and nice, and the Governor wi&s;hes to take the advice of the principal Of|ficers in the Garri&s;on, which he is certain will be given candidly, and for the ho|nour of his Maje&s;ty's arms.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed a maxim, without ex|ception, That the longer a Garri&s;on holds out, the more honour is due to that Garri&s;on; it mu&s;t of cour&s;e follow, that nothing &s;hould be ri&s;qued by a &s;mall Garri&s;on, well provided with every thing which contributes to &s;horten the &s;iege. Large Garri&s;ons may wi&s;h to in|vite the Be&s;iegers to enterpri&s;es, in the ex|ecution of which they mu&s;t lo&s;e many more men than the be&s;ieged: indeed, overgrown Garri&s;ons, perhaps, &s;hould ob&s;tinately defend the Covered Way; although there is no in|&s;tance I know of where the Be&s;iegers failed in the attack of the Covered Way. On the other hand, it is certain the a&s;&s;ailants gene|rally lo&s;e three times the number in the ob|&s;tinate defence of a Covered Way.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion at pre&s;ent is, Whether our &s;trength will admit of the ob&s;tinate defence of our Inward Covered Way, the retreat from which being by narrow &s;tairs, and not many of them, and there being no men left in the Garri&s;on to defend the Ditches and man the Ravelines, to protect and give time to recover the confu&s;ion of a night retreat of beaten troops, followed pell-mell into the vi|tals of the place, is to be ri&s;qued? In the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, in my poor opinion, the con|&s;equence mu&s;t be equally as di&s;graceful as fatal. The enemy are well acquainted with the pa&s;&s;ages from the Lunettes into the Ditches. At the very time they pur&s;ue the part of our baffled, feeble Garri&s;on, which retreat from the Covered Way, they &s;eize upon the defences we have made to cover the retreat of the troops from the Lunettes: this they will do with ea&s;e. So the defences for the pre|&s;ervation of the retreat from the Lunettes mu&s;t, without the lo&s;s of a man, become theirs, and the troops in the Lunettes &s;urren|der pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>If the Inner Covered Way is defended partially by a &s;ufficient number of men, to at|tempt the defence of the <HI>Places d' Armes</HI> there, men for that purpo&s;e may be found, and the &s;ecurity of their retreat may be coolly &s;ecured by the men po&s;ted in the Ditches. But how precarious are our &s;tairs from the <HI>Places d' Armes!</HI> one round of the enemy's mortars may, in half an hour, de&s;troy them all but one, viz. that in the rear of the Kane.</P>
<P>The Governor has made a di&s;po&s;ition of the troops, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be judged expe|dient to defend the Inner Covered Way par|tially; it is laid before the above Officers for their con&s;ideration, and advice to improve it. It has been &s;aid, that there is little dependence in the defence of a Ditch from the flanking fire of four or eight Mu&s;quetoons; but when it is con&s;idered that the Enemy mu&s;t, man by man, come by ladders only into the Ditch, our Grenadoes above will not be idle. Add to that, twenty men to charge them with their bayonets when attempting to form, the&s;e men will certainly &s;ucceed, and over&s;et the ladders. The men employed in this part of the defence need run no ri&s;que from our grenadoes above: a &s;ignal below, either by fife or drum, may be &s;ettled to warn the troops above to cea&s;e or renew the throwing their grenades. It is to be con&s;idered, the de&s;cent into a Ditch, in the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, is very different from that into a work attacked and filled almo&s;t up with the Breach made in the Scarp. In this ca&s;e, the Enemy have every material nece&s;&s;ary at hand, from the immediate vicinity of their approach, to fill up the Ditch: in the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed one, they mu&s;t be brought from a great di|&s;tance by unarmed men, who probably will drop them, and throw the ladders likewi&s;e, as even our troops did at the attack of St. Lazar.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are of opinion that the Inner Covered Way is to be defended ob&s;tinately, will con&s;ider our numbers, which indeed is not equal to manning or lining it; for there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in that ca&s;e to rein|force our guard con&s;iderably within, for the protection of our magazines, and other pur|po&s;es. The worn-out feeble &s;tate of the Gar|ri&s;on is a circum&s;tance to be weighed, when it is expected men are to make a vigorous re|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="65" REF="71">in the defence of a wretched Covered Way at fir&s;t, but particularly &s;o now, from the Palli&s;ades being de&s;troyed, upon which the fate of the Garri&s;on mu&s;t in&s;tantly de|pend. It may likewi&s;e be con&s;idered, that in this di&s;po&s;ition of ri&s;quing all in the defence of the Inward Covered Way in que&s;tion, we may, with ju&s;tice, be accu&s;ed of wanting that patience and firmne&s;s, which, by prolonging the &s;iege, we &s;hall have opportunities of ex|hibiting. Courage is common almo&s;t to all men; patience, fortitude, and &s;teadine&s;s, di&s;|tingui&s;h the good &s;oldier, and, I humbly judge, is the only mode we have to get honour and a good capitulation, when we are reduced to the utmo&s;t extremities.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions, therefore, are three.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. Are we to ri&s;que the fate of the place upon the ob&s;tinate defence, in as powerful a manner as we can, of the Inward Covered Way?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Are we to make a di&s;po&s;ition, leaving only part in the Covered Way, &s;uch only as are nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the <HI>Places d' Armes</HI> for &s;ome time, who may do execu|tion again&s;t the a&s;&s;aulting enemy, and coolly retreat without lo&s;s?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. Are we to reinforce the Covered Way by more men than tho&s;e propo&s;ed for the Places of Arms? If we are, what number is propo&s;ed by the Officers who &s;hall be of that opinion?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Governor thinks it right, on this oc|ca&s;ion, to declare that his opinion is in favour of the &s;econd que&s;tion, as long as the &s;tairs and places of arms remain entire. When they are de&s;troyed by the thundering artillery of the Enemy, which may rea&s;onably be ex|pected hourly, we have no alternative: the Covered Way in que&s;tion mu&s;t then be en|tirely abandoned, except the Place of Arms at the &s;alient angle of the North We&s;t Out|ward Raveline: this &s;hould be guarded for a <HI>Sortie;</HI> it may be mined, &s;o as to be blown up at any time, if we are obliged to abandon it.</P>
<P>The Governor wi&s;hes not only to have the advice and opinion of the Officers, of what has been mentioned above, but of every thing which may occur to them which they judge may be nece&s;&s;ary, and may have e&s;caped the attention of the Governor.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, That the &s;tate of the Garri&s;on is &s;uch, that we apprehend it could make but a feeble re&s;i&s;tance in manning the whole of the Interior Covered Way.</P>
<P>Secondly, That we are of opinion a partial defence of the Inner Covered Way will not afford &s;ufficient protection to the advanced works, nor prevent the Enemy from getting into the adjacent Ditch.</P>
<P>And therefore we think, that without a &s;ufficient protection from the Inner Covered Way, the advanced works cannot long re&s;i&s;t a &s;erious attack; nor do we think, that the fire from the Inner Works, ruined as they are, would much impede or annoy an Enemy.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We are of opinion, that when the advanced works are forced, or the Enemy gets into the adjacent Ditch, by leaving the&s;e advanced works behind them unattacked, the retreat of the men in tho&s;e works mu&s;t be cut off, and the Fort probably &s;oon obliged to &s;urrender on terms di&s;advantageous to the Garri&s;on.</P>

<P>We beg leave to repre&s;ent to your Excel|lency, that from the foregoing con&s;iderations, and the ruinous &s;tate the whole, and parti|cularly the advanced works, are reduced to, from the uncommon cannonade and bombard|ment which has ince&s;&s;antly been kept up again&s;t them, and the inability of the Gar|ri&s;on to protect them from the Inner Covered Way, they are not in a condition to re&s;i&s;t an a&s;&s;ault, and of cour&s;e no defence to the Fort, which mu&s;t probably yield to the Enemy, on their own terms, &s;oon after tho&s;e works are taken or cut off, if no relief arrives from Great Britain before &s;uch an event happens.</P>
<P>It is therefore humbly propo&s;ed, in order to get the mo&s;t honourable terms for the Gar|ri&s;on, and the mo&s;t advantageous to the Crown, and the mo&s;t probable method of pro|longing the &s;iege, to give time for &s;uch relief to arrive, if it is the intention of England to &s;end any.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="72">
<P>That a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms be propo&s;ed to the Duc de Crillon, for a certain number of days to be named; and if before the expira|tion of that time, not any effectual relief ar|rives, the Fort to be given up (on the mo&s;t honourable and mo&s;t advantageous terms) to the &s;uperior force of the Enemy.</P>

<P>WITH great attention I have con|&s;idered your paper, in an&s;wer to what I had the honour to propo&s;e, and lay before you this day. Your an&s;wer takes in a latitude I never meant to give you, that of the prudential rea&s;ons for entering into terms of capitulation with the a&s;&s;ailants. The &s;tage of the &s;iege can by no means, in my opinion, admit of that: our only con&s;ideration at pre&s;ent is how to prolong our defence; it was upon that point, and that point alone, I con&s;ulted you. The idea of capitulating to me &s;eems a very di&s;tant one; indeed it is mortifying that the expe|rience I have had in the &s;ervice has &s;o little weight: the reputation I have acquired in it will not admit of my con&s;ent to propo&s;e any terms to the En$my for the &s;urrender of the place till we are drove to the la&s;t extremity; I have promi&s;ed &s;o to his Maje&s;ty; I told his Mini&s;ters we looked upon our&s;elves as a for|lorn hope, who would glory in doing our ut|mo&s;t for the honour of our Ma&s;ter's arms. To think at this period of any reinforcement from England, mu&s;t be chimerical; all we have to be &s;olicitous for is our own glory: this is a con&s;ideration, in my poor opinion, infinitely beyond the political ones relative to the con&s;ervation of the &s;eamen, the utility of the troops in future &s;ervice, and the ri&s;que we run of being forced to &s;urrender at di&s;|cretion. I will pawn my military reputation that we &s;hall never be reduced to that nece&s;|&s;ity. Believe me, I mean to be prudent, but intrepid. Some confidence I expected would have been put in me; but as it is the opinion of the principal Officers of the Garri&s;on (for without their concurrence I can expect little from the troops), I can only demand this obedience in the execution of my ideas, which in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner I do. If it is not to be granted, I am no longer the Governor; I re&s;ign the command to the Lieutenant Go|vernor, who is a better Officer, I &s;incerely believe, than I am; I am &s;ure he is a better politician: &s;o there may be no demur or up|roar on the &s;ubject.</P>

</LIST>
<P>THE above Members being a&s;&s;embled, the Governor addre&s;&s;ed them as follows:</P>
<P>THE Governor has the utmo&s;t confidence in the Officers a&s;&s;embled; he thanks them for their la&s;t opinion, but is &s;orry he cannot acquie&s;ce with them in it.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="73">
<P>He judges, that in our &s;ituation, the place &s;hould be defended to the la&s;t extremity, we being here as a forlorn hope, left to give &s;pe|cimens to the world of the bravery of the King's troops, both Briti&s;h and Hanoverian; and that idea mu&s;t be pur&s;ued, as long as pru|dence will admit; and the Governor is deter|mined to endeavour to put it in force.</P>
<P>He has called the Officers pre&s;ent together, to give their aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by their ad|vice, to &s;upport his determined efforts in the execution of that idea.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of which, he thinks it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to lay before them the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, that by affidavits, and the mo&s;t accurate examinations which he has been able to make, (which affidavits and examinations are laid before the Council, and hereunto an|nexed) it appears certain that the Enemy are now undermining the Marlborough.</P>
<P>The Governor thinks, if that is clear to the Council, that the Marlborough, with every thing that can be u&s;eful for the defence of the Garri&s;on, &s;hould be retired, and the Marlborough abandoned and blown up, and that without lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P>Humanity dictates this; the reinforcement that would be de&s;troyed, in ca&s;e the Enemy blows up the Marlborough, is nece&s;&s;ary for our future defence.</P>
<P>By the information of a de&s;erter, an at|tack upon Charles Fort &s;eems determined; to the Governor it appears probable. The re|inforcement of the Garri&s;on of the Marl|borough, and others which are de&s;tined, will, it is pre&s;umed, render the attempts of the Ene|my there abortive.</P>
<P>La&s;t night a Serjeant, and four of the Cor|&s;icans, de&s;erted to the Enemy from Fort Marlborough; and this day, by the united information of &s;everal &s;entries, the troops from Cape Mola, and the French Camp, to the amount of 2000 men (as well as they could gue&s;s) marched from their po&s;ts and encampments towards Mahon. From thence the Governor judges the Enemy mean an a&s;|&s;ault; and he thinks the &s;ignal for the a&s;&s;ault may be the blowing up the Marlborough by the Enemy; and that is his rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to re|tire the troops from the Marlborough this night, and blowing it up as &s;oon as it is expedient.</P>
<P>He has no doubt but that, in an univer&s;al a&s;&s;ault, the Queen will be one of their prin|cipal objects, being reduced (in his opinion) to &s;uch a degree, that it is rendered above ground indefen&s;ible.</P>
<P>The General may be mi&s;taken with re&s;pect to the &s;ituation of the Queen; and therefore the Chief Engineer, in his &s;eat, is de&s;ired to give his opinion of the &s;tate of that work.</P>
<P>The Chief Engineer's opinion, relative to the Queen, is, that the defence from the ramparts of the work is at an end; and that he does not find, from the number of men which he believes the Garri&s;on can afford, as working parties, and from the materials of which we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that it can be re|&s;tored to any rea&s;onable degree of defence:</P>
<P>That he thinks, that although the fire from the Creneaux in the counter&s;carp of the Ditch is &s;till entire, yet he thinks that fire is in&s;ufficient to the repelling a vigorous a&s;|&s;ault:</P>
<P>That from what the Chief Engineer has &s;aid, the Governor is of opinion, that in ca&s;e of an a&s;&s;ault, the Queen, as well as Fort Charles, will be the principal objects of the Enemy:&mdash;That therefore he judges, for the honour of our arms, in the &s;tate in which the Queen is repre&s;ented to be by the Chief Engineer, that it &s;hould be defended partially, that is to &s;ay, by chicane; &s;o that the Enemy may be drawn artfully into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and that at a proper period abandoned and blown up, the mines under it being loaded for that purpo&s;e:</P>
<P>That the u&s;ual daily guard for the Queen is &s;ufficient to effectuate this; and that the night reinforcement for the Queen &s;hould retire from thence to Fort Charles, where the a&s;&s;ault &s;hould be repul&s;ed by every effort we can make:</P>
<P>That if the Enemy makes an univer&s;al a&s;|&s;ault upon all the Outworks, before they are reduced to the &s;ituation of the Queen, it is the Governor's opinion they &s;hould be di&s;|puted ob&s;tinately:</P>
<P>That when they are reduced to that &s;i|tuation, he thinks the &s;ame mea&s;ure &s;hould be pur&s;ued with regard to them, as he has propo&s;ed relative to the Queen:</P>
<P>That with regard to a general a&s;&s;ault on the body of the place, from the di&s;po&s;itions made, and the number of the troops in it, he is under no apprehen&s;ion: on the contrary, for the honour of the Garri&s;on, he wi&s;hes it may be attempted.</P>
<P>Thus the Governor has given every infor|mation, he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, to the Council; and, as a proof of his perfect confidence of their zealous efforts for the honour of the troops, he relies on their advice with re&s;pect to what is to be done. To that re&s;pect he will comply with it, from the confidence he has in them, &s;till determined to re&s;i&s;t to the la&s;t moment.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="74">
<P>Our honour requires it, and it is with that view he de&s;ires the advice of his Officers.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, the Governor propo&s;ed the following que&s;tions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Que&s;tion I. Whether is the Marlborough to be abandoned immediately, and blown up, or not, this night; and the garri&s;on of it &s;ent to reinforce Charles Fort?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Que&s;tion II. Whether is the Queen's Re|doubt only to be defended partially, (that is to &s;ay by chicane) with a guard con&s;i&s;t|ing of one Captain, one Subaltern, and twenty-five Men; and when the Enemy are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, blown up; and the pre|&s;ent night reinforcement of that work &s;ent to Charles Fort every night? The General thinks this can be done without the know|ledge of the Garri&s;on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Que&s;tion III. Does the Council approve of what is propo&s;ed relative to the defence of the Lunettes, which are &s;till capable of de|fence above ground; and when reduced to the &s;tate of the Queen, that they &s;hould be partially defended as that work? Or does the Council judge it expedient that the Lu|nettes &s;hould, even in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, be only partially defended?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>ANSWERS <HI>to the</HI> FIRST QUESTION.</P>
<P>Capt. Town&s;end an&s;wers in the affirmative, as expre&s;&s;ed in the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Town&s;end.</HI></P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gauntlet an&s;wers in the affir|mative.</P>
<P><HI>W. Gauntlet,</HI> Lieut. Col.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gruben an&s;wers in the affir|mative.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. De Hagar an&s;wers in the af|firmative.</P>
<P><HI>J. C. De Hagar.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of opinion, that the Marl|borough &s;hould be abandoned and blown up, as the garri&s;on of it is nece&s;&s;ary for the de|fence of Fort St. Philip's.</P>
<P><HI>J. Acklom,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Brew&s;e is of opinion, that the &s;ame attention that has been employed about the Lunettes, on this &s;ide St. Stephen's Cove, does not appear to him to have taken place at the Marlborough; and that he thinks that the major part of the troops &s;hould be with|drawn, but that a &s;ufficient number of men &s;hould be left in it to blow it up, in ca&s;e of an a&s;&s;ault, or of the Enemy's blowing a mine of theirs: but that he thinks that the ab&s;olute evacuation of the Marlborough, and the imme|diate blowing of it up by the mines we have prepared for that purpo&s;e, would be con&s;idered by the Enemy as an undoubted prelude to the &s;urrendering the whole Garri&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>J. Brew&s;e,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle is of opinion, that the Marl|borough &s;hould not be blown up this night, but evacuated immediately of its &s;tores, &amp;c. as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch an event, when that may be thought nece&s;&s;ary, from further intelligence, or for &s;trengthening the garri&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>H. Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>Col. De Lin&s;ing leaves it to the deci&s;ion of the Governor and Chief Engineer, as he is unacquainted with the defence of fortifica|tions.</P>
<P><HI>J. W. Lin&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>General De Sydow al&s;o leave it to the de|ci&s;ion of the Governor and Chief Engineer, being unacquainted with the defence of for|tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>H. B. De Sydow,</HI> General Major.</P>
<P>QUESTION <HI>by the Governor to Col.</HI> BREWSE.</P>
<P>Whether or not Col Brew&s;e does not think that drawing off part of the Garri&s;on of the Marlborough, an effectual di&s;covery will be made, by the fir&s;t de&s;erter from us to the Ene|my, of our having abandoned the defence of it?</P>
<P>ANSWER <HI>by Col.</HI> BREWSE.</P>
<P>Col. Brew&s;e does not think it fair to require &s;uch an&s;wers from him, as may tend to &s;hake the opinion he has already given.</P>
<P>THE Governor did not mean any thing un|fair by the que&s;tion he put to Col. Brew&s;e: he is &s;orry he is hurt by it: he only meant, in ca&s;e he &s;hall adopt Col. Brew&s;e's idea, to have his advice how to execute it.</P>
<P>ANSWER <HI>to the</HI> SECOND QUESTION.</P>
<P>Capt. Town&s;end's opinion is in the affir|mative.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Town&s;end.</HI></P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gauntlet's opinion is in the af|firmative.</P>
<P><HI>W. Gauntlet,</HI> Lieut. Col.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gruben is of opinion, that the guard &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of thirty-three men, and the remainder of the night reinforcement be &s;ent to Charles Fort: in other re&s;pects, he an&s;wers in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. De Hagar cannot give his opi|nion, with re&s;pect to the mode of defence of the Queen's Redoubt, not having vi&s;ited that
<PB N="69" REF="75">po&s;t &s;ince the Enemy opened their batteries, being at Charles Fort, and entirely occupied with the defence of that work.</P>
<P><HI>H. De Hagar.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of opinion, that from the ruinous &s;tate of the Queen, that only a partial defence &s;hould be made there by the guard; and that as &s;oon as the Enemy got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, it &s;hould be blown up, and the night reinforcement to retire into the inner works, where the Governor may think it the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for their defence.</P>
<P><HI>J. Acklom,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Brew&s;e is of opinion in the affirmative of the very words of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>J. Brew&s;e,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle is of opinion, that there does not appear to him any objection to the mode propo&s;ed, relative to the defence of the Queen.</P>
<P><HI>H. Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>Col. De Lin&s;ing an&s;wers the &s;ame as the fir&s;t que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>J. W. Lin&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Gen. De Sydow an&s;wers the &s;ame as the fir&s;t que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>H. B. De Sydow,</HI> Major General.</P>
<P>ANSWERS <HI>to the</HI> THIRD QUESTION.</P>
<P>Capt. Town&s;end is of opinion, that only a partial defence &s;hould be made of the Lu|nettes.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Town&s;end,</HI> Captain.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gauntlett is of opinion, that only a partial defence &s;hould be made of the Lunettes.</P>
<P><HI>W. Gauntlett,</HI> Lieutenant-Colonel.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gruben is of opinion, that even in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Lunettes, a partial defence &s;hould only be made.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. De Hagar an&s;wers the &s;ame to this que&s;tion as he did to the &s;econd.</P>
<P><HI>H. De Hagar.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of opinion, that as the Lu|nettes cannot be &s;upported by any troops from the Inner Covert Way, a partial defence of them &s;hould only be made.</P>
<P><HI>J. Acklom,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Brew&s;e is of opinion with Col. Ack|lom.</P>
<P><HI>J. Brew&s;e,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle, as he has the honour to com|mand the Briti&s;h Lunettes, he cannot pre&s;ume to advi&s;e the mode of their defence: but &s;uch as his Excellency the Governor will be plea&s;ed to order, he will execute to the utmo&s;t of his power.</P>
<P><HI>H. Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Lin&s;ing an&s;wers the &s;ame as to the other que&s;tions.</P>
<P><HI>J. W. Lin&s;ing,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Gen. De Sydow an&s;wers the &s;ame as to the other que&s;tions.</P>
<P><HI>H. B. De Sydow,</HI> Major General.</P>
<P>The Governor, de&s;ires if the Members of the Council have any thing to propo&s;e for the defence of the place in general, that they will &s;end it in writing.</P>

<P>AS Col. Brew&s;e expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts, whether the Enemy's approach by mining was &s;ufficiently a&s;certained by the evidences, which were produced to the Council;</P>
<P>And that even it appeared, by the&s;e evidences, that a delay of a day or two could not prevent the &s;afe retreat of the troops from the Marl|borough, the Governor thought it expedient to po&s;tpone the evacuation of the Marlborough that evening, and wait till the next night, that a &s;atisfactory examination might be made by the proper Officers; which was accordingly done by Col. Brew&s;e's direction.</P>
<P>The report (of the&s;e Officers hereunto an|nexed) is produced and read to the Council. The Governor is induced to think from thence, and e&s;pecially from their having altered their mode of attack, by erecting batteries to batter in breach, that the Enemy found in&s;urmount|able difficulties in attempting to undermine and blow up the work.</P>
<P>He therefore thinks it will be be&s;t not to abandon it, until a practicable breach is made by the Enemy's cannon, which he hopes will be work of time, as the cannon we are able to bring to bear again&s;t the battery newly erected again&s;t the Marlborough, have already, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;ilenced it, and are likely to maintain their &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hes, in this change of affairs relative to the Marlborough, to know the &s;entiments of the Council; and whether it will not be be&s;t to wait the event of the breach in the Marlborough being made practicable, and then for the Gar|ri&s;on
<PB N="70" REF="76">to retire and blow up the Gorge, as was determined, in ca&s;e of the certainty of the Ene|my's having &s;ucceeded in their attempt to un|dermine it.</P>

<P>THE Council being a&s;&s;embled, his Excel|lency the Governor addre&s;&s;ed them as fol|lows:</P>
<P>Brother Officers,</P>
<P>THE candour and openne&s;s, with which I have conducted my&s;elf with regard to you, makes it impo&s;&s;ible for you to reproach me, or for me to reproach my&s;elf in any re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>Sixteen days ago, when you thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms from the Duc de Crillon for a time, till &s;uccours might arrive from Britain, my experience dictated to me that that time was in our own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for, &s;ure I am, had we men, we have nothing to apprehend from any attempts of the Enemy.</P>
<P>In the idea of an a&s;&s;ault, he is a bold but ig|norant Officer, who will (in my poor opinion) venture to a&s;&s;ert we were expo&s;ed to &s;uch an at|tempt &s;ixteen days ago, when the ravages of the &s;curvy had not taken place. Now, the de&s;ertion of one man may alter the ca&s;e; for this day we have only 741 men able to carry arms of the four regiments, 389 &s;ailors, and 95 of the Royal Artillery now doing duty; of which number, viz. 1225 men, rank and file, 600 and odd are reported by the Faculty to be &s;cor|butic, and liable daily to be u&s;ele&s;s and unfit for any duty whatever. The reports of the Fa|culty lie before you, (are hereunto annexed) and they attend to be examined.</P>
<P>It now remains for me only to apologize for not concurring in your fir&s;t opinion, of imme|diately treating with the Duke of Crillon, agreeable to your fir&s;t opinion, given to me un|a&s;ked.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, to that purpo&s;e I am to ob&s;erve to you, that although I expected no &s;uccours from England, I thought we had the means of making a glorious defence for our numbers. That the a&s;king a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms was a poor artifice, ea&s;ily &s;een through by the mo&s;t ignorant Enemy, and if granted, was only a matter of parade calculated to amu&s;e the &s;hallow military politicians of St. James's Cof|fee-hou&s;e. The loading and blowing up our mines, as has been propo&s;ed, &s;erved no other purpo&s;e. I abhor o&s;tentation, as much as I de|te&s;t regulating my actions with the view only of plea&s;ing the Engli&s;h populace. Thanks to God, I am above &s;uch low artifices.</P>
<P>It has been averred by Officers of rank in the Garri&s;on, that &s;o deplorable was our &s;itua|tion a fortnight ago, that at two o'clock in the afternoon, it was practicable for the Enemy to march from their parallel, at nine hundred yards di&s;tance, and take by a&s;&s;ault the Queen.&mdash;Charles the Twelfth of Sweden would not have made &s;uch an attempt. The man who will &s;ay it is even now practicable, I &s;hall &s;u&s;pect his &s;incerity, or de&s;pi&s;e his ignorance.</P>
<P>It has been propagated that the Enemy were undermining us; the contrary has been proved. In &s;hort, the &s;tories and ideas I have mention|ed, tending to di&s;courage the &s;oldiers, and to alarm the young Officers of the Garri&s;on, have had no effect.</P>
<P>That the Officers, almo&s;t to a man, are de|termined to obey their Commander, and de|pend upon his prudence and experience for the guardian&s;hip of their honour, and that of his Maje&s;ty's arms, I have had a&s;&s;urances from the mouths of mo&s;t of them.</P>
<P>That the &s;oldiers are animated with the &s;ame &s;entiments, is evident to every man: rather than yield and &s;uccomb under their pre&s;ent ma|lady,
<PB N="71" REF="77">they con&s;ent to be lifted up to go &s;entry; and having performed that office, are found dead in their beds when called upon to take it again in their turns.</P>
<P>All this calamity, Brother Officers, has ru&s;h|ed upon us &s;ince the 18th of January. You then thought it proper and nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for a time, and at the ex|piration of that time to capitulate.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion now is, whether or not we &s;hould not capitulate directly? The parade of a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, &amp;c. appears to me idle in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. An immediate remedy for the relief of our mo&s;t brave di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers is what we &s;hould try to obtain. The Duke of Crillon will not con&s;ent to recover men who may act again&s;t him; but he mu&s;t con&s;ent to &s;upply our ho&s;pitals with the only means of re|covery, if we capitulate directly.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, therefore, I now put to you, which is the la&s;t I probably &s;hall have the ho|nour to propo&s;e to you, is, are we to capi|tulate immediately, or are we to abide by your fir&s;t propo&s;ition, of demanding a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, at the expiration of which we mu&s;t ca|pitulate?</P>
<P>If we capitulate immediately, I have the ho|nour to lay before you the terms (hereunto an|nexed) which occur to me nece&s;&s;ary to propo&s;e, and the mode of propo&s;ing them.</P>
<P>If any of you can &s;ugge&s;t better terms, or a better mode, I &s;hall be happy to adopt your ideas.</P>
<P>THE Members being called upon to give their opinions to the above que&s;tions, an&s;wered as follows:</P>
<P>Capt. Town&s;end an&s;wered, that the former opinion, given January the 18th, was to de|mand a certain number of days to be fixed on, in order to get time in favour of a relief: yet (as appears) by the declaration of the Phy&s;ician, and Surgeon General of the I&s;land, the cir|cum&s;tances in which the Garri&s;on was at that time, and is at pre&s;ent, entirely annihilates that idea. On which account, I humbly conceive the former opinion ought to be laid a&s;ide, and an immediate capitulation &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>Lieut Col. Gauntlet is of the &s;ame opinion as Capt. Town&s;end.</P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of the &s;ame opinion with the former.</P>
<P>Col. Brew&s;e is of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle is of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>Col. De Lin&s;ing is of opinion, from the de|claration of the Phy&s;icians, and the impracti|cability of the men doing the duty of the Gar|ri&s;on, and to pre&s;erve the few men who re|main, that an immediate capitulation &s;hould be made.</P>
<P>Gen. De Sydow is of the &s;ame opinion with Col. Lind&s;ing.</P>

<P>FROM the extraordinary increa&s;e of the &s;ick in the Garri&s;on, and the little progre&s;s we make in reducing this evil, we judge it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, on account of the public &s;ervice, as well as our own credit, to inform your Excel|lency, that the prevailing di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;curvy, among&s;t the troops, is got to &s;uch an alarming height, as &s;eems to us to admit of no remedy in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Every means has been tried to palliate this formidable malady; but the daily, and we may &s;ay hourly, falling down of the men, baffles all our endeavours.</P>
<P>The different Returns of the Sick will &s;hew your Excellency the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. We are &s;orry to add, that it does not appear to us, that any one now in the ho&s;pital will be able to do the &s;malle&s;t duty under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, where no vegetable food is to be had, nor free air.</P>

<P>THE &s;everal Members being re-a&s;&s;embled, pur&s;uant to an Order from his Maje&s;ty,</P>
<P>THE Judge-Advocate General acquainted the Court, That he had it in command to expre&s;s to them his Maje&s;ty's entire appro|bation of their having pointed out tho&s;e offen|&s;ive and intemperate expre&s;&s;ions, which had appeared before them in evidence, obviou&s;ly tending to the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences be|tween Lieut. Gen. Murray and Sir William Draper; for the preventing whereof, his Ma|je&s;ty is plea&s;ed to refer it to the Court-Martial, after weighing every circum&s;tance, to propo&s;e &s;ome mode of accommodating the di&s;pute, by &s;uch explanation, acknowledgement, and con|ce&s;&s;ion, on either part, as the occa&s;ion may &s;eem to require; and which may, in the opinion of the Court, con&s;i&s;t with the honour of the par|ties, and their character as Officers: And that it is his Maje&s;ty's farther plea&s;ure, that, con|vening the parties before them, they do exert their earne&s;t endeavours to induce a reciprocal acquie&s;cence in &s;uch honourable terms of ac|commodation; and to obtain from each a &s;o|lemn engagement, that the difference &s;hall there terminate, and have no further con&s;e|quences: To which end, the Court have his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e his royal name, au|thority, and injunction; as al&s;o, if they &s;hall &s;ee occa&s;ion, to impo&s;e a &s;trict Arre&s;t upon both the parties, until a Report &s;hall be made of the matter to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Court, in obedience to his Maje&s;ty's commands, took the &s;ubject into their mo&s;t &s;e|rious con&s;ideration; and, upon mature delibe|ration, &s;ettled &s;uch Acknowledgement and Apo|logy to be made on the part of Sir William Draper to Lieut. Gen. Murray, and al&s;o &s;uch An&s;wer thereto to be expre&s;&s;ed by Lieut. Gen. Murray towards Sir William Draper, as in their judgment the occa&s;ion merited, and as might be mutually given and accepted con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of both.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="79">
<P>Lieut. Gen. Murray and Sir William Draper being then called in, the Judge-Advocate Ge|neral notified to them the Determination of the Court-Martial upon the &s;everal matters of charge and complaint which had been referred by his Maje&s;ty's warrant for their deci&s;ion, to|gether with his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure thereon, as follows: namely;</P>
<P>THAT the King had declared his royal appro|bation of the opinion of the Court-Martial, upon every point; but that, in con&s;idera|tion as well of the zeal, courage, and firmne&s;s, with which Lieut. Gen. Murray appears to the Court to have conducted him&s;elf in the defence of Fort St. Philip's, as of his former long and approved &s;ervices, his Maje&s;ty had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e with any other reprimand, in re|&s;pect of the mi&s;conduct whereof he has in two in&s;tances been found guilty, than that which the &s;entence of the Court-Martial in it&s;elf virtually conveys;</P>
<P>And that his Maje&s;ty had, at the &s;ame time, expre&s;&s;ed much concern, that an Officer of Sir William Draper's rank and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed character &s;hould &s;uffer his judge|ment to be &s;o far perverted by any &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal grievance, as to view the general conduct of his Superior Officer in an un|favourable light, and in con&s;equence to exhibit &s;everal charges, which the Court-Martial, after a diligent inve&s;tigation, have deemed to be frivolous or ill-founded.</P>
<P>The Judge-Advocate General then informed the parties, That the Court-Martial had judged it their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to make a repre&s;enta|tion to his Maje&s;ty of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions con|tained in a letter from Sir William Draper, of the 16th of January, 1782, and of Lieut. Gen. Murray's an&s;wer thereto, of the &s;ame date, as having an obvious tendency to produce the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences <HI>[reciting the &s;aid repre&s;enta|tion from the Minutes of the Court];</HI> and that his Maje&s;ty had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to refer it to the Court-Martial, to &s;ettle &s;ome proper mode of terminating the matters in difference, in a manner which might be con&s;i&s;tent with the honour and character of both; and, for effectu|ating the &s;ame, had given the Court full per|mi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e his royal name, authority, and injunction: In con&s;equence whereof, the Court had entered into a particular con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject; the re&s;ult whereof would be &s;tated, with more propriety and weight, by the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident then addre&s;&s;ed the parties to the following effect:</P>
<P>THE Court having thought them&s;elves in|di&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to take notice, in their Report to his Maje&s;ty, of &s;ome very of|fen&s;ive words which came before them in full evidence in open Court, contained in a letter from Sir William Draper to Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.&mdash;<Q>Your in&s;inuation, &startq;that I am attempting to take the com|mand &endq;from you, is <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>infamous;</HI></Q> and al&s;o of an expre&s;&s;ion in an an&s;wer to the &s;aid letter from Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.&mdash;<HI><Q>As to per&s;onal abu&s;e, I &s;hall do my|&s;elf &startq;ju&s;tice, you may be a&s;&s;ured, when the &endq;proper time arrives:</Q></HI> And his Maje&s;ty having been plea&s;ed to re-convene this Court, for the purpo&s;e of terminating this proceeding in a manner con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of both parties;</P>
<P>I am de&s;ired, by the Court, to acquaint you, Sir William Draper, That they do not think tho&s;e very offen&s;ive words, "fal&s;e "and infamous," u&s;ed by you, as above recited, to Lieut. Gen. Murray, your Commander in Chief, and in time of ac|tual &s;ervice, can be ju&s;tified from any cir|cum&s;tance which previou&s;ly happened; and therefore think it incumbent upon them to declare their opinion, that you ought to make a &s;atisfactory acknowledgement to Lieut. Gen. Murray for the &s;ame, in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;This Court-Martial having, upon mature con&s;ideration, expre&s;&s;ed their opinion, that Lieut. Gen. Murray's letter to me, of the 16th of January, 1782, which drew from me the intemperate words in que&s;tion, viz. "Your in&s;inuation, that I am attempting to take the command from you, is fal&s;e and infamous," did not import the charge of any actual at|tempt $o take the command from him, which, hurt as I then felt my&s;elf, I had conceived, I do not he&s;itate to acknow|ledge, that tho&s;e words were very impro|per and unju&s;tifiable, and to declare my concern for having u&s;ed them; and I do, in deference to the &s;en&s;e of the Court-Martial, de&s;ire, that Lieut. Gen. Murray will accept this declaration as an apology &endq;for the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>And the Court are of opinion, That you, Lieut. Gen. Murray, ought to be com|pletely &s;atisfied with the &s;aid declaration, and expre&s;s that &s;atisfaction in the follow|ing words, viz.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I do accept this acknowledgment as a &s;uf|ficient and full apology for the words u&s;ed by Sir William Draper in his letter to me; and I do, on my part, expre&s;s my concern, that I &s;hould have made u&s;e of any words which could have &s;o much &endq;hurt the feelings of Sir William Draper.</Q></P>
<PB N="74" REF="80">
<P>And the Court expects to receive from both parties the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances, that this affair &s;hall have no further con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>Sir William Draper, upon hearing the terms propo&s;ed, declared his willingne&s;s to regulate his conduct by the judgement of the Court, profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf content to make the acknow|ledgement and apology, which the Court had pre&s;cribed as proper and con&s;i&s;tent with his ho|nour, and ready on his part to comply with their injunction in its full extent.</P>
<P>Lieut. Gen. Murray declared him&s;elf ready to abide by the injunction of the Court, with re&s;pect to the matter not having any further con&s;equences, and to pledge his honour in that behalf, <HI>&s;o long as he continued a &s;oldier;</HI> at the &s;ame time remon&s;trating again&s;t, and objecting to, that part of the declaration expected from him, which is expre&s;&s;ive of concern that he &s;hould have made u&s;e of any words which could have hurt Sir William Draper's feelings: And, upon an explanation being de&s;ired from him as to his complying with the injunction of the Court, <HI>&s;o long as he remained a &s;oldier,</HI> he plainly intimated, he &s;hould not hold him&s;elf bound to &s;uch compliance beyond that period, and that he tru&s;ted he &s;hould not be compelled to &s;erve during life.</P>
<P>The Court, after having offered &s;ome con|ciliatory arguments and explanation, recom|mended it to the parties to withdraw for a time, and to Lieut. Gen. Murray in particular to con&s;ult &s;ome of his friends upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;pace of time elap&s;ed, Lieut. Gen. Murray returning, declared, that he &s;till re|tained the &s;ame &s;entiments, and, that he might not be mi&s;under&s;tood, had committed the &s;ame to writing, which he read, to the following effect:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;In all private converns, I conceive I am ma&s;ter of my own actions; and I choo&s;e to keep my honour under my own pre&s;ervation: in every military point, I am under the or|ders of the King, who&s;e commands are &s;acred. If Sir William Draper has been guilty of any military offence, the department to which it belongs will do ju&s;tice to their country&mdash;As to what re&s;pects me privately, I &s;eek for &endq;no interference.</Q></P>
<P>The Court, after having required and re|ceived from Sir William Draper a pledge of his honour, that no adver&s;e mea&s;ure &s;hould origi|nate from him in con&s;equence of this unhappy difference, judged it nece&s;&s;ary to remand Lieut. Gen. Murray &s;ubject to his Arre&s;t, until a Re|port of the whole proceeding &s;hall have been made to his Maje&s;ty, and his royal plea&s;ure &s;hall be &s;ignified thereon.</P>

<P>I HAVE this day had the honour of laying before the King your Letter to me of the 1&s;t in&s;tant, and &s;hould have thought my|&s;elf deficient in duty to his Maje&s;ty if I had omitted to &s;tate the Letter which I had pre|&s;umed, without receiving his &s;pecial command-to write to you in an&s;wer.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, intirely approving the proce|dure of the Court-Martial, and the mode pre|&s;cribed by them for terminating the difference between you and Sir William Draper, had en|tertained hopes that a deference to their opi|nion, inforced by an expre&s;s authority from his Maje&s;ty, would, upon calm reflection, have induced you to &s;ubmit to their injunction,&mdash;as his gracious interpo&s;ition had not for its object the pa&s;&s;ing over unnoticed the very intemperate words produced in evidence, but only the &s;ub|&s;tituting an honourable conce&s;&s;ion, or &s;ome other proper mode of reparation for offence gi|ven, in place of the violent and exceptionable mea&s;ure which was manife&s;tly in the contem|plation of the parties,&mdash;and as the re&s;pective apologies which have been injoined by the Court appear to be &s;trictly becoming, and due on each part, as well as requi&s;ite in point of example.</P>
<P>As the Court is not at pre&s;ent &s;itting to re|ceive it, his Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to accept your &s;olemn and explicit a&s;&s;urance, as pledged by your letter to me, that the matters in difference between you and Sir William Draper &s;hall not have any adver&s;e con&s;equences originating from you, and has comm$nded me to &s;ignify to you an enlargement of the <HI>clo&s;e arre&s;t</HI> lately im|po&s;ed, the immediate occa&s;ion whereof is by that engagement removed; but his Maje&s;ty has at the &s;ame time ordered me to inquire of you for his Maje&s;ty's information,&mdash;before you are wholly relea&s;ed from your former arre&s;t, or his Royal plea&s;ure be &s;ignified for di&s;&s;olving the Court-Martial,&mdash;whether you &s;till per&s;i&s;t in declining to accept and comply with the terms of apology propo&s;ed to you from the Court.</P>

<P>The Memorial of Lieut. Gen. James Murray Mo&s;t humbly &s;heweth,</P>
<P>THAT your Memoriali&s;t finds him&s;elf truly mi&s;erable that he cannot prevail upon him&s;elf to expre&s;s, in the words pre&s;cribed to him by the Court-Martial, the Reply to Sir William Draper's Apology to him:</P>
<P>That, being con&s;cious he never did &s;ay or write a word which was meant to hurt the feel|ings of Sir William Draper, to declare to the world that he did, would be loading him&s;elf with the blame of having originated the un|happy difference between Sir William Draper and him, which was &s;o unbecoming, and might have been &s;o hurtful to your Maje&s;ty's &s;er|vice:</P>
<P>That, though he has upon all occa&s;ions de|clared that he is mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to your Ma|je&s;ty's plea&s;ure, &s;till he is in humble expecta|tion your Maje&s;ty will not lay your commands upon him to &s;ay what he does not think, and what would make him unhappy while he has an exi&s;tence:</P>
<P>That, if it is &s;till nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould make &s;ome Declaration before the Court-Mar|tial, he will mo&s;t chearfully make the follow|ing one, viz. "I do, in deference to the &s;en&s;e of the Court-Martial, accept this acknow|ledgement as a &s;ufficient and full Apology for the words u&s;ed by Sir William Draper in his Letter to me; and I think it very unfortunate if any words of mine &s;hould have &s;o much hurt the feelings of Sir William Draper, whom I ne|ver did mean to offend while he was under my command at Minorca, as I have often declared both in public and private."</P>

<P><HI>Copy of an Apology made by Lieut. Gen. Sir</HI> Wil|liam Draper <HI>to Lieut. Gen.</HI> Murray.</P>
<P>THIS Court-Martial having, upon mature con&s;ideration, expre&s;&s;ed their opinion, that Lieut. Gen. Murray's Letter to me of the 16th January, 1782, which drew from me the intemperate words in que&s;tion, viz. "Your &startq;in&s;inuation that I am attempting to take the &endq;command from you is fal&s;e and infamous," did not import the charge of any actual attempt to take the command from him, which, hurt as then felt my&s;elf, I had conceived; I do not he&s;itate to acknowledge, that tho&s;e words were very improper and unju&s;tifiable, and to declare my concern for having u&s;ed them; and I do, in deference to the &s;en&s;e of the Court-Martial, de&s;ire that Lieut. Gen. Murray will accept this Declaration as an Apology for the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Copy of a Reply made by Lieut. Gen.</HI> Murray <HI>to Lient. Gen. Sir</HI> William Draper.</P>
<P>I DO, in deference to the Court-Martial, accept this Acknowledgement as a &s;ufficient and full Apology for the words u&s;ed by Sir William Draper in his Letter to me; and I think it very unfortunate if any words of mine &s;hould have &s;o much hurt the feelings of Sir William Draper, whom I never did mean to offend while he was under my command at Minorca, as I have often declared both in public and private.</P>
<P><HI>Copy of the Re&s;olution of the Court-Martial upon the above Reply.</HI></P>
<P>UPON full con&s;ideration, the Court retain their opinion that the Reply which they, at their la&s;t Meeting, enjoined to be made by Lieut. Gen. Murray to Lieut. Gen. Sir Wil|liam Draper, was ju&s;t and proper; and they have the &s;atisfaction of knowing that it has been honoured with his Maje&s;ty's entire ap|probation; but, being willing to comply with Lieut. Gen. Murray's earne&s;t wi&s;hes, as far as may be con&s;i&s;tent with that opinion, and e&s;|teeming the Reply now offered in his own words to be of the &s;ame import, with this dif|ference only, that it expre&s;&s;es a more direct di&s;avowal of any intention to offend Lieut. Gen. Sir William Draper, than the Court had thought fit to enjoin, the Court does, agree|ably to his Maje&s;ty's gracious permi&s;&s;ion, adopt the &s;ame, in&s;tead of the Reply which they had before pre&s;cribed, and declare that it ought to be accepted by Lieut. Gen. Sir William Dra|per, as equally &s;atisfactory.</P>

<HEAD>General MURRAY's Defence.</HEAD>
<P>Sir GEORGE HOWARD, and the other General Officers a&s;&s;embled on this Court-Martial.</P>
<P>I AM brought a pri&s;oner before you, after forty-three years &s;ervice in various &s;tations, under all the different climates where his maje&s;ty's arms have been employed in the exten&s;ive ope|rations, which will fill the page of hi&s;tory: during that period, without ever having been the author or the object of any military di&s;ho|nour, nor the pro&s;ecutor of any officer to a public trial, much le&s;s a pri&s;oner my&s;elf at the bar of ju&s;tice; &s;o that I freely acknowledge this to be the part of duty incident to my profe&s;&s;ion with which I am the lea&s;t acquainted, as the court mu&s;t have often perceived during the ex|amination into the charges exhibited again&s;t me; yet, con&s;cious as I was of my weakne&s;s in this re&s;pect, I felt &s;uch a &s;trength in the in|tegrity of my own intentions, and &s;uch a con|fidence in the di&s;cernment and ju&s;tice of bro|ther officers, who are to judge of my conduct, has made me di&s;claim calling any profe&s;&s;ional advocate to my aid, how much &s;oever the complicated accu&s;ations, with which I have been loaded, and my own poor abilities might have claimed that indulgence.</P>
<P>It is not my wi&s;h to conceal or perplex any thing&mdash;It is my de&s;ire to have every accu&s;ation &s;ifted to the bottom.&mdash;It was this motive that induced me to apply for a Court-Martial to de|cide on my conduct; &s;ome of my friends have thought I did wrong in pre&s;&s;ing &s;uch a deci&s;ion; it certainly is not a &s;ituation wantonly to be courted, but like other di&s;agreeable occurrences in life, mu&s;t not be avoided where honour calls for a judicial deci&s;ion; and while I lament the trouble which &s;o many re&s;pectable officers have undergone on this account, I will freely &s;ub|mit to their candour whether it was po&s;&s;ible for me, under the in&s;inuations thrown out, and which have now been publickly avowed, and the charges exhibited again&s;t me, to &s;it down quiet without demanding a public examination.</P>
<P>I am far from being vain of the talents which God has given me, or the experience which has fallen to my lot for the improvement of them in the line of my profe&s;&s;ion; and yet, without the imputation of &s;elf-conceit, I hope it may be allowed me to &s;ay, that I have &s;ome military reputation as an officer to protect; I feel al&s;o that, in the defence of the Ca&s;tle of St. Philip's, under the various difficulties which occurred, and no hopes of relief, I have &s;ome merit with the public, concerning which, I was de&s;irous that the whole army might have an opportunity of judging upon certain grounds; and al&s;o that my family and friends might po&s;|&s;e&s;s, now and hereafter, a ju&s;tification beyond the power of &s;ophi&s;try or malignity to impeach. Be&s;ides the&s;e motives, I had another incentive to pre&s;s for this Court-Martial.&mdash;I conceived that the reputation of his Maje&s;ty's arms, and the national character, as well as my own, were concerned; and was therefore ju&s;tly anxious that the truth of all the circum&s;tances &s;hould be made known throughout Europe. For although I have made no complaints that no a&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;ent to me during &s;o long a &s;iege, and although I have endeavoured to avoid every imputation of blame upon others, and to confine the ju&s;tification of my own con|duct to the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of the means put into my power; yet I hope the peculiar cir|cum&s;tances attending my garri&s;on, in this re|&s;pect, will never be forgotten for their honour, and my own, by tho&s;e who con&s;ider the final cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>In a &s;cene &s;o trying, with a feeble garri&s;on, a defective fortification, and little hope of relief when attacked by the combined forces of &s;uch powerful enemies, I mu&s;t con&s;ider it as a very unfortunate circum&s;tance, notwith&s;tanding the little regard I can now po&s;&s;e&s;s for General Sir William Draper, that a man of his rank, &s;ta|tion, and reputation for abilities, &s;aw all my actions through the medium, which appears from the charges he has exhibited; for cer|tainly
<PB N="78" REF="84">if ever di&s;union could prove of de&s;truc|tive con&s;equences to the public intere&s;t, it was as far as it could operate in the &s;ituation in which we &s;tood; and whether the cau&s;es of this di&s;union proceeded from me or General Draper, one or the other of us has much to an|&s;wer for to his country.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider that the charges exhibited by Sir William Draper comprehend a period of two years, in which even the mo&s;t minute ar|ticle of my conduct, civil and military, has been examined with the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive cir|cum&s;pection in order to furni&s;h matter of com|plaint, it is &s;urprizing to my&s;elf, in revolving upon the inaccuracies and accidents incident to human life, upon a &s;trict review of what is pa&s;t, when many circum&s;tances are brought to light which were at the moment unknown, that I have not given more occa&s;ion to appeal to the experience of this Court for forgivene&s;s in tho&s;e omi&s;&s;ions, which fall to the lot of the able&s;t officer in &s;uch tran&s;actions as tho&s;e in which I have been engaged. I believe the &s;iege of Sweidnitz is e&s;teemed the be&s;t defence which has appeared in modern times; and yet, if Mr. Grebeval were a&s;ked at this day, when all the movements of all the be&s;iegers are known, whether, in any one point, he would have acted otherwi&s;e than he did? it is po&s;&s;ible he would acknowledge &s;ome error which he had com|mitted.</P>
<P>Fortified with this opinion, if there was really any matter which I could believe might have been better effected in the &s;iege of Fort St. Philip, I would now confe&s;s it; but I &s;o|lemnly declare, with the experience of eight &s;ieges to aid my judgment, I do not conceive, upon reflection, how I could have acted other|wi&s;e than I did with any advantage to the public. It is certain, though of no con&s;equence, in the ultimate deci&s;ion, that the naval ar&s;enal had better been de&s;troyed: but this was an object &s;o much in the department of Captain Law&s;on of his maje&s;ty's navy, that I could not order it, and I tru&s;ted to him in the execution of what had been concerted between us.</P>
<P>That Sir William Draper &s;hould differ with me in opinion, upon various points of &s;ervice, under the choice of &s;uch difficulties as occurred, is mo&s;t natural; nor could I with any claim to a ju&s;t under&s;tanding, be offended at this diffe|rence in opinion, if the points in i&s;&s;ue turned merely upon the que&s;tion, whether the judg|ment of Sir William Draper or my own weak opinion was the be&s;t? The military actions of the great$n officers, both ancient and modern, have undergone the &s;evere&s;t critici&s;ms; and it would be the extreme of folly for any man to expect an exemption from that &s;crutiny; but the charges preferred again&s;t me do not admit of that manner of con&s;idering them. They nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome corruption or treachery as the motives for my conduct, and particularly in not oppo&s;ing the approaches of the enemy; this is the mo&s;t captivating charge to vulgar minds who are ignorant of the bad con&s;equences to be apprehended, and the little effect which is to be expected from firing ince&s;&s;antly on the fir&s;t parallel, before the &s;pots where the enemy intended to con&s;truct their batteries are di&s;co|vered: but &s;o far from acting by caprice or re|&s;entment, or what is &s;till more ignoble, from mean jealou&s;y in this re&s;pect, I will &s;hew from a previous report I made to the king, that I acted in all things from deliberate re&s;olves, drawn from my conception of the &s;tate of the fortification and the probable attack, and the be&s;t mode of defence which could be adopted under the circum&s;tances in which we &s;tood.</P>
<P>That the Duc de Crillon did attempt ac|quiring po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortre&s;s I commanded, by corrupt means, is known to all the world, as well as the an&s;wer I made to him at the moment, while I proclaimed the di&s;graceful pro|po&s;al. I claim no merit from this behaviour, I hope the meane&s;t &s;oldier in my garri&s;on would have equally rejected &s;uch an ignominious offer; but I beg, while I claim no merit from &s;uch conduct, that it may not &s;ubject me to any ma|licious in&s;inuations.</P>
<P>It is beneath me to enter into any examina|tion on that head.&mdash;The zealous defence I made at Fort St. Philip, although I would not wa&s;te my ammunition on every pa&s;&s;ing di&s;tant object, will &s;ufficiently refute the imputation; at the &s;ame time it becomes proper for me to &s;ay, that Captain Don, my &s;ecretary, who will be ex|amined on many articles of the charges, knows the whole of that tran&s;action, if the Court &s;hall incline to put any que&s;tion to him on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, ju&s;tly complain of Sir Wil|liam Draper, for endeavouring to prejudice the public opinion again&s;t me, by a number of charges, which he has not even profe&s;&s;ed or at|tempted to e&s;tabli&s;h in proof. But I derive too much advantage from &s;uch a conduct, before di&s;cerning and upright judges, to &s;peak of it as an injury. The &s;ure&s;t way of judging of the truth or probability of any doubtful accu|&s;ation, more e&s;pecially of one that ought only to have public ju&s;tice for its object, is by examining clo&s;ely the &s;pirit in which it is made.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="85">
<P>If in &s;uch a complaint of a public accu&s;er, there are any, much more if there are many charges evidently dictated by malice or gro&s;s prejudice; if there be found a number of articles which he mu&s;t have certainly known from the beginning to have been incapable of the &s;lighte&s;t &s;upport from evidence, which could therefore be introduced for no other rea&s;on than to prejudice and defame, and which he him&s;elf &s;eeks even again&s;t the wi&s;hes of the accu&s;ed to abandon and retract, the pre&s;umption in the minds of ju&s;t and &s;aga|cious judges, is, that the &s;ame temper pervades the whole accu&s;ation, and thus the innocence of the accu&s;ed derives &s;upport from the inju&s;tice of the accu&s;er. Whether this ob&s;ervation ap|plies to the ca&s;e before you, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the judgement of this Court, who have heard the evidence adduced by the pro&s;ecutor, one of the heavie&s;t charges again&s;t me, and which has made the greate&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the public is article the 1&s;t, letter B.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Giving out in public orders on the 8th day of January la&s;t (being the third day of the &s;iege) that the enemies battering train was &s;uch as had never before been brought again&s;t any place of the fir&s;t magnitude &s;ince the in|vention of gunpowder, and that the garri&s;on might be a&s;&s;ured that the defence of Fort St. Philip's had little or no dependance upon its artillery, which orders tended to augment the terror of the enemies attack, and to cool the zeal and ardour of the artillery men of the gar|ri&s;on, and from the date of which order, the fire from the place became almo&s;t extinct in the day time; and the enemy redoubled their efforts.</P>
<P>Now is it po&s;&s;ible for any man to read the entire original order, and pervert the plain and obvious meaning of it to &s;uch an accu&s;ation as is &s;tated above, or to believe that a man could &s;uppo&s;e that this order &s;hould have the effect of di&s;piriting the Corps of Artillery as de&s;cribed in the charge? I a&s;k if there has been a tittle of evidence under all the di&s;content which bad &s;ucce&s;s in war always generates, to vindicate the a&s;&s;ertion; I do not pique my&s;elf on being an elegant writer; I have carried arms from my youth, and was not educated for any of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, neither did I ever &s;tudy the words of any military order, with a view of parade; I wi&s;h at all times to make my mean|ing intelligible; and I can only declare to this Court, that I never was more unfortunate in conveying my &s;entiments, or le&s;s under&s;tood, if my words contained in that order can bear the interpretation which my accu&s;er has put on them; for my intention was to rouze the &s;pirit and vigilance of the garri&s;on, and to di&s;&s;ipate &s;ome little alarm which the opening of &s;o unu&s;ual a train of artillery again&s;t us had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>In like manner I &s;ubmit to the Court whether the 1&s;t. 2d. 3d. and 4th. articles in the charge A are not of the &s;ame complexion; and I leave it to the world to judge what weight is due to any charge exhibited by Sir William Draper, who could a&s;&s;ert to his Maje&s;ty A article 5th. in or|der to induce a belief of neglect and &s;urpri&s;e on my part, and the rapid approach of the enemy on the other, that even my own goods, plans, and papers were &s;eized, and the troops retired into the Fort with great confu&s;ion, lo&s;s and di&s;|grace. I refer to the evidence produced, and I &s;ubmit to the Court, if there is the &s;lighte&s;t ground for &s;uch allegations.</P>
<P>Several of the other articles which Sir William Draper wi&s;hed to abandon, were evidently ex|hibited to the public with the &s;ame view of injuring me in their good opinion; and it was for this rea&s;on I would not con&s;ent to their being withdrawn, that the Court might be convinced in one of two alternatives, either that my accu&s;er had preferred his complaint without due inve&s;ti|gation or knowledge of the &s;ubject, or that not|with&s;tanding he had previou&s;ly examined the matter, his prejudices were &s;uch, that he was willing to hazard his reputation upon a&s;&s;ertions that could not bear examination, in hopes he might relinqui&s;h them at his plea&s;ure, after they had been included in the King's Warrant, and read by a credulous public.</P>
<P>Of this kind I &s;ubmit to the Court, whether I have not a right to con&s;ider A article the 9th, B article 3d, article C, D article 2d and 3d, E article 2d, F article the 1&s;t, 2d, and 3d.</P>
<P>The great que&s;tion in this enquiry is, &s;ub|&s;tantially, whether I defended the fortre&s;s of Saint Philip's to the utmo&s;t of my abilities, and whether I &s;urrendered it to the enemy before there was a ju&s;tifiable nece&s;&s;ity &s;o to do. In the articles exhibited by my accu&s;er, there is an ap|parent contradiction; fir&s;t he charges me with not &s;ufficiently retarding the enemy's approaches, and next he accu&s;es me of &s;urrendering the place when no impre&s;&s;ion had been made on the body of the work, nor the advanced batteries of the enemy nearer than 500 yards, and this after they had &s;et down before the place &s;ix months. It would appear from thence however, whether from our activity or the enemy's negligence, that the enemy's approaches had been retarded for &s;ome cau&s;e or other, and as the place was not &s;urren|dered from the impre&s;&s;ions made by their attack; therefore as far as re&s;pects the public, the que&s;tion &s;eems of no con&s;equence; but in what regards my
<PB N="80" REF="86">military reputation it is very material; and I hope to demon&s;trate to the Court, that there was not the lea&s;t degree of blame to be imputed to me; but I repeat again, that the &s;ole que&s;tion as to the public, turns on this, viz. whether a &s;evere and rapid &s;ickne&s;s from the &s;curvy among the troops, and a pe&s;tilential fever incident to that putrid di&s;order, obliged me to &s;urrender the place when I did; and whether, &s;uppo&s;ing that to be the ca&s;e, I was the cau&s;e of that calamity, or whether I did not do every thing in my power to prevent its effects? the&s;e points I wi&s;h may be inve&s;tigated to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>I admit, with my accu&s;er, that the place might have held out for two months longer, if this un|fore&s;een calamity had not &s;eized the garri&s;on; and all my conduct was governed by that be|lief, as I &s;hall &s;hew in many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Still I cannot admit, even under the evil con|&s;equences of this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, that our de|fence was by any means di&s;honourable to his Maje&s;ty's arms.</P>
<P>The Fortre&s;s of Saint Philip's was be&s;ieged in the la&s;t war; the garri&s;on then con&s;i&s;ted of 3252 men, of which 2951 were regular troops; the army of the Duke de Richlieu was 14000 men; the place was taken in 72 days after an effort was made to relieve it, and the Governor was made a Peer.</P>
<P>My garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of 2692 men, of which number only 2016 were regular troops, inclu|ding 400 Invalids &s;ent from England in 1775; the army under the Duc de Crillon was 16000; and from the time of his landing, to the time of my &s;urrender, was 171 days.</P>
<P>I had no relief &s;ent to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, my un|fortunate worn out &s;oldiers &s;uffered every hard|&s;hip incident to the want of vegetables and foul air. I &s;uffered many of tho&s;e calamities in com|mon with the re&s;t, and did not &s;urrender my garri&s;on until all the principal officers of the fort were unanimous in their opinion that no further effective defence could po&s;&s;ibly be made; and in reward, I am a pri&s;oner before this court, loaded with imputations of the foule&s;t and blacke&s;t nature, drawn up by a man, who &s;eems to have been harbouring malice again&s;t me from the year 1780, and couched in lan|guage the mo&s;t opprobrious and reproachful to a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the general ob&s;ervations which I pre&s;ume to make on the accu&s;ation preferred again&s;t me; I &s;hall next proceed to an&s;wer them article by article, and to adduce evidence in &s;upport of what I affirm to be the truth. In doing this, I mu&s;t beg your patience if I &s;hould tre&s;pa&s;s on your time in too long an examina|tion, where perhaps the matter is already clear to the members of the Court-Martial, who are &s;o conver&s;ant in the &s;ubject; but as my age and a broken con&s;titution, worn out in the defence of Fort St. Philip's, may be the la&s;t military &s;ervice of any con&s;equence in which I &s;hall be engaged, I wi&s;h to make it evident, not only to my brother officers, but equally clear and intelligible to every member of the community, that I have not either by ignorance, negligence, or de&s;ign, betrayed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me; but that on the contrary, I have acted to the be&s;t of my abilities with attention and zeal, for the honour of my King and Country, and the glory of the Briti&s;h arms, as yet un&s;ullied by any act of mine.</P>

<HEAD>The Preambles to General MURRAY's Defence to each Article of Charge.</HEAD>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>IN opening this article of charge, the Court mu&s;t remember the manner in which Sir William Draper wi&s;hed to have waved it. He &s;aid (no doubt in the &s;pirit of candour) that there were many things and many precautions taken by me, becoming <HI>a wi&s;e and prudent go|vernor;</HI> that he would not rob me of any prai&s;e where it was due; but that in other re|&s;pects I was &s;ometimes carele&s;s and negligent; that my conduct was incon&s;i&s;tent, and that he had produced this article to prove my negli|gence and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In order to con&s;ider this charge fully, as no doubt the general turn of my character, whe|ther vigilant or carele&s;s, mu&s;t influence very much in judging of the other charges; I beg leave to enter more particularly into this article than either the evidence produced or the import of it would otherwi&s;e vindicate.</P>
<P>From the intelligence I had e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was impo&s;&s;ible that any attempt to &s;urprize Fort St. Philip's could take place without my knowledge; &s;uch an attempt could only be in the &s;ummer months, in flat boats or row gal|lies, from Barcelona or Majorca; &s;uch ve&s;&s;els cannot approach the coa&s;t of Minorca in the winter months: but I was aware of the po&s;|&s;ibility of &s;uch an enterprize in the &s;ummer, and therefore was very anxious to have barracks built for the officers of the garri&s;on of the fort, as will appear by my $$tre$$ to the &s;ecre|tary at war, dated 14th of March 1776.</P>
<P>From the want of &s;uch barracks, it never had been thought nece&s;&s;ary by my predece&s;&s;ors in command, to put all the officers of the re|giments doing duty in the Fort, to the hard|&s;hip of lying with their men in the &s;ubterra|neans. There never were more at any time, peace or war, ordered to lie in the fort, than the numbers which could be accommodated in the quarters of the Governor and Lieutenant-Go|vernor in the Square, and in the buildings in Charles Fort. It never had been the practice to mount more than one officer's guard, con&s;i&s;t|ing of a captain, a &s;ubaltern, and from 24 to 50 men, varying as occa&s;ion required, and three or four &s;erjeant's guards, from eight to fourteen men each.</P>
<P>Innovations, which put gentlemen to what they think unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, and affect their convenience, are to be made by degrees, and properly timed; it being e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in a governor to cultivate the affections, or at lea&s;t the good will of his officers. My &s;tanding orders, and the general orders of the 31&s;t of De|cember, 1775, upon the diminution of my garri&s;on, and the arrival of the Hanoverian battalion, will &s;hew, when produced to the Court, that I was not inattentive to keep up di&s;cipline and military decorum.</P>
<P>I refer more particularly to the articles 6th, 7th, and 8th, and my order of the 31&s;t of De|cember, will further make it appear, that the guards were augmented from 48 to near 300 men, and that I appointed a field officer of the day, which had never been done before.</P>
<P>Still it may be urged, that military decency was neglected, by not obliging all the officers to lie with their men in the fort, as they mu&s;t have done had they been encamped. The ca&s;e however is different, proper accommodations are allowed the officers in camp; it has been the in|variable and nece&s;&s;ary practice to oblige them to keep with the men in the field: the example of the officers in that ca&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;hould not be di&s;pen&s;ed with. In Fort St. Philip's, where there is no accommodation for them, the &s;ol|diers were accu&s;tomed to be &s;en&s;ible of the im|propriety of all the officers lying in the &s;ub|terraneans; and therefore their being better ac|commodated in the barracks at George Town, which was &s;o very near, and built on purpo&s;e for their reception, had no bad effects in point of example: it had none in point of &s;ecurity at the time my accu&s;er mentioned, in February 1780; for, as I have &s;aid, to &s;urprize us by gal|lies, or large row-boats, was at that &s;ea&s;on imprac|ticable; be&s;ides, I have had certain information
<PB N="82" REF="88">of every &s;tep the enemy took at Barcelona, Car|thagena, and Majorca. I relied on my in|formation from the&s;e places, and knew that their garri&s;ons had been dimini&s;hed to reinforce the camp at St. Roque, &s;o that of cour&s;e there would be no de&s;ign again&s;t us in any of tho&s;e ports: there was no nece&s;&s;ity therefore to order all the officers into the fort.</P>
<P>There was no fleet of the enemy in the Me|diterranean at this time; Lord Rodney had de|moli&s;hed the Spani&s;h &s;quadron in the month of January, and rode triumphant in Gibraltar Bay; he had &s;upplied the garri&s;on with its wants, and detached three &s;hips of the line to e&s;cort the victuallers &s;ent from England to us.</P>
<P>That there was a rumour every year, from the commencement of ho&s;tilities with France, of an intention to invade our i&s;land, is as cer|tain as it was natural.</P>
<P>That I encouraged &s;uch reports is true, it being nece&s;&s;ary to &s;timulate the efforts of every one, to put the rotten, feeble fort, in as good a &s;tate of defence as its &s;ituation would admit of. The engineers will declare what was done in that re&s;pect, from the fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion of a rupture with France to the day my accu&s;er ar|rived; they are to declare if it was po&s;&s;ible for my garri&s;on, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we could get from the inhabitants, to do more than was done; they may in this place likewi&s;e declare, whether every thing was not carried on with uncommon oeconomy; for one of the charges again&s;t me is, &s;quandering the public money.</P>
<P>The commanding officers of corps will te&s;|tify the pains I took in the di&s;cipline of the troops, and my care to have them in&s;tructed in the exerci&s;e of the great guns, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and made acquainted with the &s;ubterraneans of St. Philip's.</P>
<P>My attention to the ordnance department, &amp;c. appears by the orders, 31&s;t of January, 1779, which will be produced.</P>
<P>I hope my accu&s;er will remember he &s;aid often, and in public, that he was &s;urprized to find we had done &s;o much. It is but fair to mention this declaration, as it exempts him from the &s;u&s;picion of wi&s;hing to in&s;inuate from this charge, that nothing was done till his own arrival; an in&s;inuation which would be as un|ju&s;t as it would be ungenerous.</P>
<P>The certain intelligence I had of the efforts the enemy were making in the month of March, to build and equip large floating bat|teries at Majorca, and fitting their magazines with provi&s;ions, &amp;c. at Carthagena and Barce|lona, induced me to order an additional batta|lion into the fort, and the officers of the regi|ments quartered there to remain in it during the night. This, however, I did with no other view than that of &s;timulating our operations, for nothing, I well knew, could then be in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;ail us by the ve&s;&s;els in que&s;tion, till late in the autumn.</P>
<P>This will be proved by my orders, 21&s;t of March, 1780, and with the &s;ame view I went into the fort on the 15th of April, where I re|mained till the middle of June, by which time I got certain intelligence that the floating bat|teries, the provi&s;ion and &s;tores collected at Bar|celona, were, as &s;oon as built and collected, &s;ent to the camp at Alguiziras.</P>
<P>If it is nece&s;&s;ary, the engineers will inform the Court what was done to improve the fort while I was in it. They may declare what I committed in charge to the lieutenant-governor to be done, when I left him the entire command of it, with power to do whatever in addition $word$ thought nece&s;&s;ary to be done: and they may al&s;o point out what part of the works I had ordered, was executed accordingly, and what additions were made by Sir William Draper, and their utility.</P>
<P>Every charge exhibited again&s;t me by the ac|cu&s;er mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from his zeal for the public; of cour&s;e he &s;hould have proved that the troops &s;uffered in point of di&s;cipline and good order, from the officers &s;leeping in George Town; but his report to his Maje&s;ty, as reviewing-general of the regiments in gar|ri&s;on, a&s;&s;ures the king, they were defective in nothing but numbers and vigour, the two Briti&s;h regiments being worn out.&mdash;This report will be produced.</P>
<P>The accu&s;er cannot pretend to &s;ay, that the works in the fort could have been forwarded by the pre&s;ence of the officers in the night, when no work was carried on; and in the day time the proper officers actually attended the work|ing parties. Had more guards been mounted, fewer men could have been &s;pared for the work|ing parties; of cour&s;e this fir&s;t charge is a mi&s;|taken exce&s;s of zeal in the lieutenant-governor for the good of his country.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>In the years 1777 and 1778, the hou&s;es in Saint Philip's, excepting the officer's quar|ters, were de&s;troyed and levelled. In 1779, I judged it expedient to raze the whole town, which was certainly a great inconvenience to the officers of the garri&s;on, both civil and mi|litary. Hence I judged it proper to &s;hew the example of a total demolition of the hou&s;e,
<PB N="83" REF="89">allowed me as governor, with the gardens and every thing, at Stanhope's tower, the &s;table and a &s;mall hou&s;e for a guard room excepted. A guard there, was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the &s;ol|diers from &s;traggling, and getting drunk in the wine hou&s;es, at Tourach. The&s;e two in&s;igni|ficant offices could afford no protection to an enemy, being only 30 feet in extent, and the walls but one cantoon &s;tone, of 13 inches thick, at the di&s;tance of 800 yards from the fire of the place, and being con&s;picuou&s;ly ex|po&s;ed, every &s;hot, every &s;hell, even cohorns, penetrated, as is proved by all the evidence. Colonel Brew&s;e having declared his opinion, that their &s;tanding was attended with no bad con&s;equences, and captain Town&s;end, that they afforded a &s;helter from the view only. Hence this magnified object was not, nor could be of any utility to the be&s;iegers, not even to ma&s;k their operations. For it is not true, as charged, that the enemy took po&s;t there, to the detri|ment of his maje&s;ty's troops; for, in fact, their guards were wi&s;ely po&s;ted in a hollow, covered from the fire of the place; neither did the&s;e two &s;mall hou&s;es ma&s;k their batteries, which were placed about 30 yards, advanced between them and the fort.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit to the court, whether it be credible, that I &s;hould have made &s;uch a &s;acrifice to the public &s;afety, as the de&s;truction of my own hou&s;e, of &s;uch elegance and conveniency, and yet leave an u&s;ele&s;s building &s;tanding, if I had conceived, or had ever been advi&s;ed, that it could have been detrimental-in a &s;iege.</P>
<P>The accu&s;er perhaps wi&s;hes to in&s;inuate by this charge that the&s;e hou&s;es were left &s;tanding from &s;elfi&s;h motives; but they were actually of no u&s;e to me: it is true there were about 20 pair of pidgeons put in the loft of the &s;table, but even this u&s;e was not made of it till the &s;pring before we were attacked.</P>
<P>The accu&s;er ought to remember how lavi&s;h he was in prai&s;ing not only the di&s;intere&s;ted de|&s;truction of Stanhopes Tower, but the demoli|tion of the beautiful and profitable Baranca there, but at that time things were &s;een thro' a different medium.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>Had Fort St. Philip's been &s;ituated in a mora&s;s, and only acce&s;&s;ible by 3 or 4 roads, not to have blown up the&s;e roads, would have been unpardonable, but the whole &s;urface of the ground between Mahon and Saint Philip's islittle more than two or three inches of earth covering the road; the country is divided into fields, by walls, which are of loo&s;e &s;tones col|lected from the &s;urface; the&s;e walls are in&s;tant|ly thrown down; 50 pioneers, I think, might have made apertures in them in two hours, all the way from Mahon to where the enemy's bat|teries were erected; the&s;e apertures were all that was nece&s;&s;ary to make excellent roads in any direction, from the artillery park of the be&s;iegers, who actually availed them&s;elves of this advantage, and were not &s;o imprudent as to u&s;e the great road in que&s;tion, further than within 300 yards of Middle Mount, (being little more than 1-3d. of a mile from their park of artillery) after they found that the re&s;t of that road was expo&s;ed to the fire of the place.</P>
<P>The reparation of the road in que&s;tion, &s;o pompou&s;ly made a charge again&s;t me, con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ome Cantoon gravel, to render it &s;mooth where it was rough; it was equally good be|fore that reparation for the tran&s;porting of can|non or any other burden; it had that repair to render it more agreeable to the garri&s;on, and the inhabitants of Mahon and George Town; this road being the u&s;ual walk for their recreation, and daily pa&s;&s;ing the guards to the fort, Capt. D'Arcy, and Capt. Town&s;end, witne&s;&s;es cal|led by my accu&s;er, have proved that the road was a good practicable road for artillery before the reparation, and that it was no ob&s;truction, even to coaches, more than to make them &s;hake.</P>
<P>The&s;e two officers have further proved, that if the enemy had landed at George Town, they would even then have only cro&s;&s;ed it; that as it was they made roads to the right and left of it; and that the road from the enemy's park of artilley, to Middle Mount, was out of &s;ight of the garri&s;on; Lieutenant D'Arcy further faith, that from the enemy's park of artillery, to the place where they turned off to their batteries, was only 600 yards; that he never &s;aw any cannon upon it, and &s;uppo&s;ed that 300 pioneers, could in one day, have made a road, from the park of artillery, to where the enemy's new road turned off, &s;ufficient for the carriage of the heavie&s;t ordnance.</P>
<P>The fact is, that from that point, it was &s;o open to the artillery of the garri&s;on, that the enemy never attempted to u&s;e it, but made new roads; for Capt. Fead declared, that after the day he fired upon the carriages at Middle Mount, he never &s;aw any more upon it.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Fourth.</HI></P>
<P>The detachment at Cuitadella, con&s;i&s;ted of 1 &s;ubaltern, 1 &s;erjeant, and 32 rank and file; and that at Fornillis, of 1 &s;ubaltern, 1 &s;er|jeant,
<PB N="84" REF="90">and 13 rank and file, in all 45 rank and file, worn out and decrepid invalids, as has been proved by Captain Butler and Lieutenant Smith; it would have been unpardonable, nor to have had out-po&s;ts at tho&s;e two places, being the be&s;t for the di&s;embarkation of troops, and where the enemy landed in 1756; they were nece&s;&s;ary to give warning of an enemy's approach on the&s;e &s;ices, and to keep the men at the &s;ignal hou&s;e alert, and to protect the towns from the in&s;uits or the enemy's privateers; for this le&s;t purpo&s;e there were <HI>two</HI> 6 pounders and <HI>four</HI> carronades at at Cuitadella; <HI>two</HI> 6 p unders and <HI>two</HI> carro|nades at Fornellis; with ammunition in propor|tion at both places; if I remember right, 30 rounds for each piece, which ordnance and am|munition were ordered to be de&s;troyed, or if practicable, &s;ent into the fort on the approach or appearance of a fleet to invade the i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 14th of Augu&s;t, 1781, when I re|ceived intelligence that we might be invaded, the orders already produced were &s;ent to the commanding officers, at the po&s;ts in que&s;tion, <HI>which I beg leave again to be read.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t appearance of the enemy's fleet on the 19th of Augu&s;t, expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent to the&s;e officers, of which they have acknowledged the receipt; and between 2 and 3 o'clock ex|pre&s;&s;es were &s;ent with fre&s;h in&s;tructions to ad|verti&s;e them of their approach, and to order them in through bye roads, as &s;hall be proved; it is not true that the artillery or &s;tores were inter|cepted, as a&s;&s;erted in the charge, having been de&s;troyed agreeable to orders: I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the Lieutenant Governor to have been ignorant of the orders given to the commanders at the&s;e po&s;ts, and of the mea&s;ures taken for their pre&s;er|vation; for if he was not, I think he would hardly have made this a charge, &s;ince it appears by the evidence called by him&s;elf, that every precaution was taken on my part, which pru|dence could &s;ugge&s;t; and that Lieutenant Smith, in throwing blame on me, was in fact proving his own mi&s;conception of clear and di&s;tinct orders.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it is but ju&s;tice to Captain Butler, and Lieutenant Smith, who were made pri&s;oners by the enemy, to declare that there was not a man in the i&s;land, who thought a Spani&s;h army could have landed in five hours after the fleet had appeared on an open and ex|po&s;ed Iron coa&s;t, which afforded no good anchor|age from the rocky bottom, and where there were no bays, but the hazardous ones of Alque|four, and Sandy Bay, in which with difficulty even boats can land, when there is the lea&s;t wind. For my own part I did not think it practicable, nor can I yet conceive, why the Duc de Crillon hazarded &s;o much. The tri|fling naval &s;tores in the dock yard, were not objects to ju&s;tify the ri&s;k of &s;uch an enterprize, even though he had known it was in his power to &s;eize them.</P>
<P>As to the other part of this charge, viz. that I had previous and &s;pecific intelligence from his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters at Florence and others, of the attack intended. It appears, from the evidence already produced, that my accu&s;er has ventured this a&s;&s;ertion on as bad authority as many other of his articles. I had no intelli|gence whatever that could be deemed &s;pecific; the whole depended on probability and conjec|ture, as appears by the words of Lord Hill&s;bo|rough's letter, which I only received on the evening of the 14th; yet no circum&s;tance, which the mo&s;t accurate information could have &s;ugge&s;ted, was omitted by me.</P>
<P>The information from Sir Horace Man and Mr. Udney, did not reach me till the arrival of the Lemon, the 5th of September, 16 days after we were inve&s;ted.</P>
<P>Having received the intelligence I before mentioned from Lord Hill&s;borough, late in the evening of the 14th, I immediately communi|cated it to the lieutenant-governor, covered by the following letter to him.</P>

<P>When I breakfa&s;ted with the Lieutenant Governor, he was of opinion the de&s;tination of the armaments in que&s;tion was mo&s;t likely for the Spani&s;h American colonies, as we were in|formed they were at that time in rebellion, as there were no magazines found either at Barce|lona, Carthagena, or Majorca. However, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to prepare for every event, by i&s;&s;uing the following orders, (early on the morning of the 15th) the day after I received the intelligence, and to the watchmen at the &s;ignal towers, and al&s;o the orders to Captain Butler, and Lieutenant Smith, which have al|ready been proved, and to the jurats and other civil officers in that quarter of the I&s;land.</P>

<P>A. <HI>Charge the Fifth.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by my letter to Sir William Dra|per, already produced, that I acquainted Cap|tain Law&s;on of the intelligence contained in Lord Hill&s;borough's letter.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 15th, Captain Law&s;on called on me; he &s;eemed thoroughly per&s;uaded that we were really to be attacked; it had long, before the alarm, been concerted between him and me, that in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion, it would be proper to de&s;troy, not only all that was in the dock yard, but to burn all the craft in the harbour, that the enemy might not avail them&s;elves of them; he therefore judged very properly, that in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation it would not be prudent for him to quit the har|bour, to check the enemy's &s;mall privateers; but as &s;oon as the wind would permit him to get his &s;hip up to the head of the harbour, not only to execute what had been concerted, but to cover and bring down the tran&s;ports that were loading the beef mentioned in my letter to Sir William Draper, which we had been obliged for want of &s;tore room in the fort to lodge in the dock yard; unhappily the wind blew &s;trong down the har|bour, and Captain Law&s;on never got the &s;hip up; but the beef was mo&s;t of it thrown into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Without entering into all the unintere&s;ting e|vidence which has been produced upon this arti|cle of charge, it will &s;ufficiently appear to the Court, that in this, as in the preceding articles, there was no culpable neglect on my part.</P>
<P>Mr. Harris has declared that I communicated to him my intelligence re&s;pecting the enemy, upon the 15th of Augu&s;t; that I con&s;ulted with him relative to the quantity of &s;tores, and the means of removing them, which he informed me could be done with &s;ixty men in forty-eight hours; that he accordingly applied to Captain Law&s;on for the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and tho' it was not immediately granted, it appears that the greater part of the &s;tores were removed on board the &s;tore &s;hips; it is admitted by my ac|cu&s;er, that every thing a-float was entirely un|der the command of Captain Law&s;on; I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf to the dock yard, and if I exculpate my&s;elf in that particular, which I hope to do beyond the power of contradiction, the other follows of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Harris declared that he con&s;idered him|&s;elf as under the command of the &s;enior officer of the navy, and that upon a former alarm, he had conceived it as his duty to make the fir&s;t application to him; his in&s;tructions from the Admiralty are to this purpo&s;e, and admit of no mi&s;con&s;truction.&mdash;He declares he had orders from the Admiralty, to give me every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power from the &s;tores under his charge, which evidently &s;hews that I had no authority whatever over him or them; to remove every &s;hadow of doubt upon this head, I &s;hall produce to the Court, a Letter to Lord Barrington, by which it will appear, that I under&s;tood I was not permitted to interfere in any thing relative to the dock yard; Mr. Harris has not di&s;tin|gui&s;hed between the value of the &s;tores which were left in that yard, but, incon&s;iderable as they were, it would certainly have been proper to have de&s;troyed them; it was &s;o concerted be|tween Captain Law&s;on and my&s;elf; and I did expect that he would have put our purpo&s;e into execution.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on for not doing &s;o, which he gave to me, was the &s;mall value and con&s;equence of the remaining &s;tores, and the damages which would have been done at the &s;tore hou&s;es and ma&s;t hou&s;e, and other buildings, &s;uppo&s;ing the
<PB N="86" REF="92">&s;iege to be rai&s;ed, or the i&s;land to be re&s;tored at the peace.</P>
<P>As to the beef belonging to the garri&s;on, it appears from my letter to Sir William Draper, that I had given the nece&s;&s;ary orders about it, and that the execution of the&s;e orders was en|tru&s;ted to Lieutenant Ca&s;e, of the marine corps, who was under Sir William Draper's com|mand.</P>
<P>As to the &s;tationing a ve&s;&s;el, I &s;hall prove by lieutenant Dougla&s;s, who was pre&s;ent when I concerted with captain Law&s;on the putting the Minorca at the head of the harbour, that it was not from any omi&s;&s;ion of mine that the &s;hip never got to the place; but in ju&s;tice to the memory of captain Law&s;on, it becomes me to &s;hew that &s;he could not be carried there on account of contrary winds. At the &s;ame time the Court will ob&s;erve the &s;mall con&s;equence the failure occa&s;ioned, &s;ince it could only have obliged the enemy to make a circuit of a mile or two at the mo&s;t; neither could the divi&s;ion of the enemy which landed at Alquefour, have thereby been impeded on their march to Mahon.</P>
<P>As to the concluding part of this article, I am ready to prove what I now declare, that every plan and paper in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion when the enemy landed, are now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and have always continued to be &s;o; and as to the di&s;graceful retreat of the troops, I &s;hall prove they marched with perfect regularity into the garri&s;on, an hour before the enemy landed on the i&s;land, and that the guard at Mahon to cover the retreat, entered the fort in the &s;ame good order at &s;un&s;et.</P>
<P>That both officers and men lo&s;t &s;ome of their baggage (occa&s;ioned by the delinquency of the Minorquines, who gave no aid in tran&s;porting it to the garri&s;on) is true; but after having i&s;&s;ued the order of the 15th of Augu&s;t, for the rugiments to be ready to march into the garri|&s;on at a moment's warning, I can only lament the lo&s;s, however trifling, which my brother &s;oldiers &s;u&s;tained, and expre&s;s my concern that their characters &s;hould have been called in que&s;|tion on that account, without taking the &s;malle&s;t degree of blame to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in ju&s;tice to them, I &s;hould further ob&s;erve, that on two former alarms, they had &s;ent their baggage into the fort at a con&s;iderable expence, which made them le&s;s credulous on the authority of a letter, &s;o vague as that from the Earl of Hill&s;borough.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Sixth.</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this charge, it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay before you my report to his maje&s;ty of the &s;tate of the place and its environs, dated the 20th of Augu&s;t, 1780, a year before we were be&s;ieged; and I mu&s;t beg of the Court in con|&s;idering this charge, as well as my order of the 15th of October, and that of the 8th of Janu|ary, particularly to remark, that I fore&s;aw the mea&s;ures which the enemy would probably pur|&s;ue, and foretold what conduct I &s;hould hold in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The report was read by the Judge Advocate, as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>General Murray's Report to the King of the State of Fort St. Philip's, and its Dependencies.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all its defects, this place, with an adequate garri&s;on, &s;hould make a glo|rious defence in the &s;tate it is now in; if leave is given to remove the ground, which protects the barranca from the fire of the be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on &s;hould not be le&s;s than three thou&s;and five hundred rank and file, with offi|cers in proportion; two companies of artillery, viz. 214, including the officers, a company of 50 miners, commanded by a captain, a lieute|nant, two &s;erjeants and two corporals, and five hundred Briti&s;h &s;eamen; the&s;e la&s;t are nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e no a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be got from the inha|bitants, even as labourers, and the troops will be &s;ufficiently occupied in exertions at arms, &amp;c. At all times a guard &s;hip is nece&s;&s;ary in this harbour, e&s;pecially in time of war, for its protection, to pre&s;erve maritime order and di&s;|cipline among&s;t the privateers, and for many other good purpo&s;es not nece&s;&s;ary to mention.</P>
<P>This guard &s;hip, in time of war, will con|&s;tantly be furni&s;hed with the requi&s;ite number of &s;eamen, by the &s;upplies we &s;hall have from the exchanged pri&s;oners of war, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The ma&s;onry is perhaps the wor&s;t which was ever &s;een; I cannot account for its being &s;o, becau&s;e the materials are mo&s;t excellent, and at hand. The pieces of the fortifications do not cover one another as they ought, and are commanded every where at the di&s;tance of 500 yards; at which di&s;tance the be&s;iegers may commence their operations without being ex|po&s;ed to a &s;hot from the fort: the nature of the country makes it impo&s;&s;ible to correct this defect; it will therefore behove the be&s;ieged to exert their &s;kill, addre&s;s, and indu&s;try, to pre|vent the enemy from quickly de&s;troying the defences of the place; for this purpo&s;e, a large magazine of facines, gabions, hurdles, earth, &amp;c. &amp;c. to repair the demoli&s;hed batteries, is laid in.</P>
<P>The ground is now every where levelled, and
<PB N="87" REF="93">laid open to the fire of the place (the grand bar|ranca excepted) to the di&s;tance of 500 yards from the outward covered way; the &s;pace from the place to where the be&s;iegers can open their fir&s;t batteries, without regular approaches, is an entire rock, and &s;ome compen&s;ation for the defects and di&s;advantages I have mentioned; becau&s;e, from that di&s;tance all regular advances mu&s;t be by &s;ap ouverte, and the earth and ma|terials brought from a great di&s;tance: hence the nece&s;&s;ity of impo&s;ing on the be&s;iegers, by re|&s;erving until this &s;tage of the &s;iege, the fire of our repaired batteries, that of the new pro|jected ones, and of the field pieces, mounted on the carriages, we have contrived to fire from the covered way, and the &s;alliant angles of the works, (a model of which is &s;ent by Captain Scott, for his Maje&s;ty's in&s;pection) and like|wi&s;e the fire of the mortars made in the rocks, (as de&s;cribed in the plan) which can throw to the di&s;tance of 450 yards, betwixt two and three hundred weight of &s;tones.</P>
<P>Captain Mayne was the fir&s;t that practi&s;ed here, this mo&s;t u&s;eful and cheap invention: the idea was taken from the u&s;e of them at Malta; the ground within the fortification doth almo&s;t every where admit of them; their &s;uc|ce&s;s is certain, and as neither them, the field pieces, nor the new propo&s;ed fa&s;cine batteries, can be much expo&s;ed, even to the recochet &s;hot of the a&s;&s;ailants, defective as we are in &s;everal capital points, our defence above ground, were the corps now in garri&s;on completed with good men to their e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;hould not be con|temptible; if we had the requi&s;ite garri&s;on, I am confident it would be glorious.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of St. Philip's con&s;i&s;ts in its &s;ubterraneans; they afford &s;uch a variety of chicane and re&s;ource, that every inch, from the glacis to the body of the ca&s;tle, may be ad|vantageou&s;ly di&s;puted by the mines and &s;mall arms, after the defences above ground are to|tally demoli&s;hed and the artillery annihilated; hence, the nece&s;&s;ity of an e&s;tabli&s;hed company of miners for this &s;ingular fortification. This may be done at a very &s;mall expence, by draft|ing fifty miners from the whole army into the corps &s;erving here, to he paid as miners only; when they are employed as &s;uch, one Briti&s;h will do the work of two Minorqueen miners; but the Minorqueens are out of the que&s;tion; they will not work for us in time of war, and at no time &s;hould they be tru&s;ted with the knowledge of our &s;ubterranean defences; a captain, at $en &s;hillings per day, a lieutenant at five, and three &s;erjeants, who being likewi&s;e &s;erjeants of the regiments they belong to, may be allowed an additional &s;hilling each, is all the requi&s;ite expence of this company; much more than that &s;um may be &s;aved by keeping the palli&s;ades in &s;hades, till it is nece&s;&s;ary, in time of war, to plant them; I have tried the experiment, and will forfeit my reputation if the whole are not effectually erected in the &s;pace of three weeks. When the board of ordnance con&s;i|ders the immen&s;e expence of the palli&s;ades of this place, they will, no doubt, admit of this propo&s;ition, and allow the &s;aving mu&s;t produce double the &s;um requi&s;ite to defray the expences of the mining company.</P>
<P>This place, I mean the &s;imple ca&s;tle, will hardly admit of the glory of defending a breach made in it; nor indeed to wait till that breach is practicable. The powder magazines being all under the &s;quare, on a level with the bottom of the ditch, I fear when the enemy have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the counterfcarp, the be&s;t chance of holding out longer will proceed from their dread of partaking of the univer&s;al havock which the blowing up of the ca&s;tle mu&s;t occa|&s;ion at a great di&s;tance; the be&s;ieged and the be&s;iegers mu&s;t be then preci&s;ely in the &s;ituation of Van Trump and his antagoni&s;t on the barrel of powder, each armed with a red hot poker; but before matters come to this i&s;&s;ue, there may be op|portunities enough for every man to &s;ignalize, him&s;elf; for with a &s;ufficient garri&s;on no work &s;hould be taken without regular approaches and practicable breaches; the&s;e breaches may and &s;hould be ob&s;tinately defended. But, alas? when our pre&s;ent garri&s;on is compared with the extent of our works, we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e the enemy will think it nece&s;&s;ary to make regular advances to us, after he has in &s;afety at the di&s;|tance of 500 yards, mined our defences and &s;ilenced our batteries, he &s;hould judge it expe|dient to &s;ave the lives of his troops to a&s;&s;ault the place. Weak as we are, his fir&s;t attempt will be ineffectual; an intelligent officer will expect, that perhaps he will mean by it little more than a di&s;covery of our re&s;ources and pre|parations for &s;uch an event; but this di&s;covery will not make him alter a plan which mu&s;t, by repeated well concerted mea&s;ures &s;ucceed in the end again&s;t &s;o &s;mall a garri&s;on, was every man of it a Hercules. It is with a very heavy heart I report this opinion to my Royal Ma&s;ter, who may be a&s;&s;ured that we cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed; and that I can an&s;wer that no exertions which men are capable of will be wanting in every in|dividual for the &s;upport of the honour of his Maje&s;ty's arms. It is, however, a melancholy reflection, that little honour will be paid to our memories by mankind in general, from an ima|gination
<PB N="88" REF="94">that the regiments here are &s;tout and well completed; our efforts will be judged in|&s;ufficient, even &s;hould every man of us expire in the execution of his duty.</P>
<P>As it may be imagined from what is &s;aid a|bove, that the heavie&s;t artillery will be employ|ed in the defences oppo&s;ing the land attacks, it is judged requi&s;ite to a&s;k a &s;upply of &s;eventeen twenty four pounders, with their proportions of &s;tores, there being no guns of that calibre here; the&s;e with twelve carronades will amply &s;upply the place of large artillery, which have been taken from the &s;ea line. I under&s;tand the re&s;|pective officers of the board here have applied to the board of ordnance in England, for eight twelve pounders, in lieu of tho&s;e lo&s;t in the Be&s;borough packet; but they agree with me, if the &s;upply I now &s;olicit is granted, we &s;hall have no need of the eight twelve pounders.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The enemy took advantage of the barrancas or ravines, which I have mentioned in that re|port, not only to convey and cover all the ma|terials they wi&s;hed to ama&s;s for the con&s;truction of their batteries and redoubts, but to cover the troops who mounted in the trenches, where they could not be &s;een from the garri&s;on, and were little expo&s;ed to our &s;hells; their parallel, or what the accu&s;er calls a &s;ap, being behind the cre&s;t of the ri&s;e, and fortified by beams, placed &s;loping again&s;t the parapet; under the cover of which, the troops were in perfect &s;ecurity. The enemy fini&s;hed a wall thickened by &s;and|bags, from 10 to 30 feet thick, on the cre&s;t of the &s;aid ri&s;e, from Stanhope's tower, to their lowe&s;t battery above the Mahon road; their parallel below the road towards the harbour, had the &s;ame advantages: under the ma&s;k of this wall their batteries were con&s;tructed, and of cour&s;e, it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to know exactly where or how many batteries were forming; all we could do was to batter and open this wall, which was frequently done without any di&s;co|very of a battery; but the breaches made in it by our artillery were con&s;tantly repaired in the night: the&s;e attempts of ours were made, how|ever, of u&s;e in retarding the progre&s;s of this wall, as they obliged our a&s;&s;ailants to give it a greater thickne&s;s, which rendered it impracticable, as Major Walton and the chief engineer can te&s;tify: I con&s;ulted both of the&s;e officers, and others who agre$d with me, that the annoying of this ma&s;king work, in the&s;e places where it was car|rying on and not perfected, was all that could be done. To have attempted more, con&s;idering the extent of it, mu&s;t not have only reduced us to want of ammunition, but have de&s;troyed our embra&s;ures; for &s;o rotten was the ma&s;onry of the fortification, that our own fire brought down the merlons: when it is con&s;idered, that the enemy began this ma&s;king wall the begin|ing of October, and did not fini&s;h it till the 7th or 8th of December; it mu&s;t be allowed my conjectures were well founded, and that every thing which prudence could dictate, was effec|tually done to retard their progre&s;s. On the 11th of December, a de&s;erter from the enemy informed us mo&s;t exactly (as it afterwards ap|peared) where the batteries of the be&s;iegers were marked out; he &s;aid &s;ome of them had been be|gun &s;ome days, and that others were not yet begun; all which proved true; for the ma&s;king wall of the battery, oppo&s;ite the Queen's re|doubt, was not begun till the 10th of Decem|ber, and I believe the French battery on the Philipet &s;ide, was not in much greater forward|ne&s;s. Captain Dixon of the artillery, who &s;peaks the Cantalan (the language of the de|&s;erter) and perfectly knows all the environs of the place, was ordered to go to the top of the ca&s;tle from whence every thing was to be &s;een, that he might be perfectly ma&s;ter of the &s;pots where the batteries were pointed out by the de|&s;erter, and to inform in&s;tantly all the artillery officers how to direct their fire again&s;t them; this was done, and from that moment an ince&s;&s;ant fire was ordered to be kept up again&s;t the&s;e ob|jects. I told Major Walton that now was his time, that we mu&s;t no longer think of &s;paring our ammunition, as we knew the proper objects to fire at: he and his officers exerted them&s;elves to the admiration of every body; they did great damage to the ma&s;king wall, which &s;till they could not effectually lay open; however, their &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t have been great in retarding the erection of the batteries of the be&s;iegers, which were not fini&s;hed till the 5th of January, a &s;pace of time no le&s;s than 26 days; it is well known that mo&s;t of the batteries were begun at the &s;ame time: they were divided among&s;t the regiments, and called by their names, to &s;timulate and ex|cite emulation: every intelligent officer knows that five days is &s;ufficient to con&s;truct any bat|tery in any &s;ituation; our men under the direc|tion of our engineers, rai&s;ed the merlons of one from the &s;ole of the embrazures, which was all the enemy had to do, in eight hours; the en|gineers and officers of artillery rai&s;ed one from the level of the platform in 16 hours; this was done to practice our men in con&s;tructing ba$tteries; the&s;e batteries, were fired upon at the di&s;tance of 200 yards, and found &s;ufficient to the convic|tion
<PB N="89" REF="95">of every &s;oldier in the garri&s;on, of cour&s;e it mu&s;t be allowed the enemy was greatly retarded, and the effect of the&s;e operations defeated as much as was in our power; to have totally pre|vented their approaches, and the con&s;truction of their batteries, mu&s;t be allowed to have been im|po&s;&s;ible. They con&s;umed no le&s;s than 1,200,000 two bu&s;hel &s;and bags, and 60,000 facines; hence it may be granted, that if they were not retarded by our efforts, they were at lea&s;t &s;earful of the con&s;equences, and provided accordingly; &s;ince the time when they begun their ma&s;king wall, to the 6th of January, when they opened their batteries, was little le&s;s than three months.</P>
<P><HI>The average quantity</HI> of powder expended from the 27th of October, when the enemy appa|rently began their ma&s;king wall, till the 11th of December, when the de&s;erter came in, was 402 lb. daily.</P>
<P><HI>The average quantity</HI> from the 11th of Decem|ber, till the enemy opened their batteries, was 3243 lb. the difference is 2841 daily, which, from the 27th of October, to the 11th of De|cember, (being 45 days) would have made a difference of 127845.</P>
<P>The quantity of powder left in the garri&s;on when we &s;urrendered, was 3511 barrels, or 351100 lb. which would have been no more than &s;ufficient for 30 days longer firing, at 11500 daily, which was the <HI>average rate of powder</HI> expended during the la&s;t eight days, when the enemy had opened their battery between the Ba|rancas.</P>
<P>Had we, from the 27th of October, when the enemy fir&s;t begun their wall, kept up the &s;ame fire which we did after the de&s;erter came in, and pointed out where it might be kept up with effect, 127845 lb. more powder would have been expended, which would have reduced us to 223255 lb. &s;ufficient for only 19 days; and the fort was in a &s;ituation to have defended it&s;elf two or three months longer had the garri&s;on kept healthy.</P>
<P>Thus much as to the &s;tate of our powder; as to &s;hells (cohorns excepted) only 1200 were left, and the cohorns were of little u&s;e, all the cohorn mortars, but one, being rendered un&s;er|viceable.</P>
<P>In this general charge, much &s;tre&s;s has been laid by the pro&s;ecutor, on &s;uffering the battery to be erected at Philipet without more interrup|tion. It appears, by his own report to me of the 3d of December, that at that time Sir William thought the walls there to be no more than a line of communication, yet he has endeavoured to prove his pre&s;cience in &s;aying to &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es, there would be a battery there; the moment I perceived the enemy's intention, I ordered a new facine battery of 6 heavy guns to be erected again&s;t it, which opened with great effect long before the enemy had compleated their battery on Philipet; if we had perceived the enemy's intention &s;ooner, perhaps we might have retarded them &s;ome days longer, but they mu&s;t have then prevailed.</P>
<P><HI>Another point</HI> Sir William Draper has endea|voured to impre&s;s on the minds of the court, namely, that the guns of the N. W. curtain of the ca&s;tle (which he always calls the We&s;t cur|tain) did not fire on the burgo&s;s; I &s;hall prove to the Court, that not a &s;ingle gun in that cur|tain, could be brought to bear on the enemy's battery called burgo&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Court will ob&s;erve that all the experienced officers already examined, and particularly Colonel Brew&s;e, the chief en|gineer, have declared that no effectual &s;top could be put to the continuance of the enemy's ma&s;k|ing work, in the manner they proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> many experiments were made.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> a vigorous exertion of artillery was fre|quently tried.</P>
<P>And that an attempt to de&s;troy this wall, if per&s;i&s;ted in, mu&s;t have reduced the garri&s;on to &s;urrender for want of powder.</P>
<P><HI>Additional Ob&s;ervations on the Ma&s;king Wall.</HI></P>
<P>After all I have heard upon the po&s;&s;ibility or impo&s;&s;ibility of preventing the Duc de Crillon to e&s;tabli&s;h his fir&s;t parallel, and the batteries con|&s;tructed upon it, it is incumbent on me to make the following ob&s;ervations, and to de&s;ire they may be in&s;erted in my defence. In the fir&s;t place, that fir&s;t parallel has been proved to be carried through ravines, &s;o as to be covered from the fire of the &s;ort; it has likewi&s;e been proved that the be&s;iegers made roads not expo&s;ed to our view, to convey every thing requi&s;ite for the con&s;truction of this parallel, and their batteries; it has been proved, that notwith&s;tanding the na|tural advantages the ravines afforded, the be&s;ie|gers built a ma&s;king wall, at an average about 20 feet thick; the extent of this wall was no le&s;s than 2000 yards, viz. fir&s;t from the Ru&s;|&s;ian ho&s;pital acro&s;s the whole breadth of Cape Mola; &s;econd, from the enemy's batteries acro&s;s Philipet Penin&s;ula; third in front of the bourgois battery; fourth, from the lower flank of the &s;avoya battery, up to Stanhope's tower; fifth, in front of Turks mount battery. It was built with great caution in the night; we may judge from the appearance of it, that every regi|ment built the wall which ma&s;ked the battery
<PB N="90" REF="96">de&s;tined to be con&s;tructed by the regiment, for it was irregularly carried on, but joined at la&s;t; &s;o cautious were they in the erection of this wall, that they undertook no more in one night than what could be &s;ufficiently fortified to r$&s;i every attempt of our's to demoli&s;h it the &s;uc|ceeding day; the experiments we made again and again to convince us of this truth, have been clearly proved to the court. I had &s;couts out almo&s;t every night, engineers frequently; their reports to me were confirmed by what I &s;aw with my own eyes in the morning. I was con|vinced then, and am &s;till of the &s;ame opinion, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to prevent the erection of this ma&s;king wall. It has been proved that the ma&s;king wall in the front of the battery of Bourgois, after we had battered it many hours, was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the next night under the continued fire of the garri&s;on; this happened the night of the 10th of December; the return of the expenditure that day was 128 rounds, almo&s;t all expended on that wall, which was only 100 yards in length, and 500 from the garri&s;on; had a proportionable fire been kept up on the re&s;t of the thickened wall, 2000 rounds would have been daily expended, and the effect mu&s;t have been le&s;s than upon that before the Bourgois; as that at Turk's Mount excepted, they were all at an average above 700 yards, which being much more than the range of point blank &s;hot from the neare&s;t work which could bear upon them. The court and the world will judge of the practicability of de|moli&s;hing, by our cannon, this wall, wherever it was con&s;tructed. I declare I know of no other method of retarding its progre&s;s than that of throwing &s;mall &s;hells, and &s;ometimes &s;hot, towards the places where we imagined they were extending it. That this was done with vigour and activity appears from the quantity of &s;hells expended from the latter end of Septem|ber to the 12th of December. I acted to the be&s;t of my capacity and judgment: I took the be&s;t advice I could get of the chief engineer, and the commanding officer of artillery. I had the honour of my country at heart, and my re|putation was at &s;take. I claim merit in what I did. I am an old officer. I have had much experience, which experience told me then, and &s;till tells me now, that none but an enemy could have advi&s;ed me to throw away my ammu|nition in combating this ma&s;king wall, erect|ed beyond point blank &s;hot of my place. Had this been the ca&s;e then, indeed I mu&s;t have been di&s;graced, and the reputation of my former &s;er|vices bla&s;ted; then I mu&s;t have &s;urrendered to the a&s;&s;ailants, who were not nearer than 600 yards, for want of ammunition, a fortre&s;s, capable of &s;ome months re&s;i&s;tance from the day the enemy opened their batteries, had not the hand of the Almighty interfered and reduced my garri&s;on by &s;ickne&s;s, to a degree of debility which made it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t a moment longer than we did: as I did not fore&s;ee this misfortune, was it not my duty to re&s;erve my ammunition in proportion to the probable re|&s;i&s;tance I thought we could make. My feeble garri&s;on would not admit of di&s;turbing the ene|my by frequent forties; had it been &s;trong, I certainly might, by well concerted ones, have retarded the progre&s;s of the be&s;iegers; but that means was not in my power.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Seventh.</HI></P>
<P>This battery was 1330 yards from the garri|&s;on, and &s;olely intended to &s;cour the entrance of the harbour. If the enemy had con&s;tructed an epaulment between it and the &s;ort, or had rai&s;ed merlons to it, which at that di&s;tance we could not have hindered, the embra&s;&s;ures of that battery being pointed to the &s;ea, could not have been opened by any gun in the garri&s;on; and all the guns of the place would not have prevented the enemy from keeping up a well di|rected ince&s;&s;ant fire again&s;t any ve&s;&s;el coming into the harbour. It was not my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew the enemy their error, and this I declared at the time, as will be proved. The event ju&s;tified this conduct; for when the Fly came into St. Stephen's Cove, the enemy was &s;oon driven from their battery, which was then fired at for her protection, having had only time to fire four of the five guns they had on it, and it was not till &s;ome time after that one of them found courage to &s;teal back and fire the 5th; and the only con&s;equence our firing at it before could po&s;&s;ibly have, would have been to make them retire the guns behind the traver&s;e, made in the rear of their battery for that purpo&s;e, and to have induced them to have completed it with proper protections.</P>
<P>This is another of the charges which evi|dently &s;hews in what light Sir William Draper endeavours to repre&s;ent my conduct; &s;ince it is hardly credible that he was not &s;en&s;ible of the propriety of leaving this battery undi&s;turbed: but if he did not &s;ee the obvious error the ene|my had committed, in &s;uch ca&s;e le&s;s regard can be paid to his judgment; for, upon the en|trance of the Fly, all my predictions were ju&s;ti|fied re&s;pecting this barbet battery.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Ninth.</HI></P>
<P>Captain Law&s;on intended to have &s;ent his frigate to &s;ea under the command of one of his
<PB N="91" REF="97">officers, on the night of the 19th of Augu&s;t; but from the &s;ituation of the enemy's &s;hips of war, he judged the e&s;cape of the frigate im|practicable, of which he acquainted me the next morning; and, incon&s;equence thereof, I de&s;ired the &s;hip to be &s;unk, and the crew to march into the fort to reinforce the garri&s;on; for the &s;ame rea&s;on I de&s;ired the tran&s;ports and General Murray privateer to be &s;unk. The&s;e mea&s;ures mu&s;t have been allowed to have been proper, as, at that time, an immediate &s;iege was to be ex|pected, and the crews of the ve&s;&s;els not to be di&s;|pen&s;ed with in the defence of the fort. Captain Law&s;on, &s;ome days after the &s;hip was &s;unk, re|que&s;ted I would give him my de&s;ire in writing to &s;ink her. I chearfully did &s;o, becau&s;e I thought the &s;inking of her proper, and knew that he mu&s;t an&s;wer to a court-martial for the lo&s;s of his &s;hip. For the &s;ame rea&s;on I gave orders in writing to the ma&s;ters of the tran&s;ports and other ve&s;&s;els which were &s;unk, that they might recover the value of them from the public.</P>
<P>What would my accu&s;er have &s;aid of me, if (weak as my garri&s;on was) I had not availed my&s;elf of the crews of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els for our de|fence. In this charge I am accu&s;ed of &s;inking the &s;hips to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy: in a preceding one I am accu&s;ed of not de&s;troying the dock yard.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The great &s;uperiority of the enemy's artillery, and the effect which it had on our rotten works, was evident to the younge&s;t &s;oldier, per|haps alarming to all. The great &s;uperiority of the artillery was likewi&s;e vi&s;ible; it became therefore ab&s;olutely my duty to acquaint the gar|ri&s;on that the defence of the place did not &s;olely depend on the exertions of the ordnance. Had I neglected this, the men, at &s;mall arms, little ac|quainted with the defence of fortified places, would from the &s;uperiority of the enemy's fire have looked upon them&s;elves as vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>I therefore in the &s;ub&s;equent part of the order which the accu&s;er has prudently omitted, point|ed out to the troops, that the great &s;trength of that place con&s;i&s;ted in its &s;ubterraneans, mines and ditches; from the&s;e I told them the works were inacce&s;&s;ible; and that it was from an ob|&s;tinate defence of the&s;e that they were to gain that glory the world expected from them. I likewi&s;e &s;timulated the artillery to new exer|tions, by a&s;&s;uring the garri&s;on that they were &s;till vigorous. Of cour&s;e, that great efforts from them were yet to be expected; that the fire from the place, even on the north &s;ide, was far from extinct, has been proved by all the evi|dence (till by the order of the 17th of January) the guns on that &s;ide were retired during the day, and only employed in the night; and when the enemy, bu&s;y in repairing the damage done to their batteries by our &s;hells, and the explo|&s;ion of their own guns, were expo&s;ed to our &s;hot. The prudence of this la&s;t order would have been &s;everely felt by the enemy in carry|ing on their &s;econd parallel, if the health of the garri&s;on had allowed it to continue the defence till that &s;tage of the &s;iege, had it not been for that precaution of retiring our guns, plunged into, as we were, on every &s;ide, we &s;hould not, at the time of our &s;urrender, have had &s;uch a con|&s;iderable number of guns mounted, nor would that formidable number of artillery, men, and &s;ea|men (on which the accu&s;er expatiates &s;o much) have exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;ire was kept up at times on the battery at the Ru&s;&s;ian ho&s;pital, and con&s;tantly on that between the Barancas from the moment it was di&s;covered. The accu&s;er &s;ays, the garri&s;on was di&s;couraged by this order. Has he been able to produce a man who was daunted by that or any other event of the &s;iege? Colonel Pringle has only ventured to &s;ay, that it might have had that effect. Sir William Draper's re&s;entment again&s;t me, mu&s;t be violent indeed! &s;ince to injure my character, he would &s;acri&s;ice the reputation of &s;o many brave men, and even the credit of the arms of his country.</P>
<P>After explaining my rea&s;ons for i&s;&s;uing this order, all further comment upon it would be im|proper, as pretending to bias the opinion of the court, who are the be&s;t judges whether this is a military order or otherwi&s;e; or whether it could po&s;&s;ibly have the effects pretended in the charge.</P>
<P>As to retiring the guns in the day-time, on the &s;uperiority of the enemy's fire, to re&s;erve them for defeating their &s;ub&s;equent approaches, it is agreeable to the &s;y&s;tem I have laid down in my report to the King; and the fact was, that the enemy, on advancing their boya, were &s;o much annoyed by our artillery, they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and, in that &s;tate of the boya, the capitulation took place.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>The places of arms were not abandoned, nor the communications from them to the ditches &s;hut up, till the ruinous &s;ituation of both ren|dered it un&s;afe to maintain them, and, till the increa&s;ing weakne&s;s of the regiments from &s;ick|ne&s;s, which, though not arrived at the violence it afterwards did, was already con&s;iderable, did not leave a &s;ufficient number of troops for their defence.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="98">
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to explain this bu&s;i|ne&s;s more than by the council of war, held the 18th of January, where my rea&s;ons are &s;ully &s;et forth, and the&s;e rea&s;ons met with the appro|bation of all the officers a&s;&s;embled, although Colonel Pringle forgot, in his evidence, that in what he &s;eemed to condemn before the court, I was ju&s;tified by his own advice at the time of the tran&s;action. I vi&s;ited the place of arms between the &s;outh we&s;t outward raveline and we&s;t coun|ter guard, the morning of the 19th, on a report of Captain Brick, and found the entrenchments &s;o much hurt by the enemy's fire, during the preceding day, it being only a two foot wall of ma&s;onry, that I was of opinion, in which the engineers agreed, that it was untenable. The place of arms at the Salient Angle, north we&s;t outward raveline, was not abandoned at the &s;ur|render, nor would the new place of arms have been abandoned had not the &s;tairs been de&s;troy|ed by the enemy's &s;hells.</P>
<P>In our &s;ituation a general a&s;&s;ault was what we had rea&s;on to expect, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been ba&s;&s;led, while we could defend our ditches.</P>
<P>The number of men we then had was barely &s;ufficient for the defence of them and the inner works; be&s;ides, as the &s;curvy had then begun, and I was a&s;&s;ured by Dr. Munro that there was a great likelihood of its proving fatal, particu|larly among&s;t the Hanoverian troops: every thing that by ea&s;ing the duty of the garri&s;on could be done to prevent that dreadful di&s;order was nece&s;&s;ary to be done; &s;ince it is univer&s;ally known to be promoted by exce&s;s of fatigue and anxiety of mind.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>As the &s;ickly &s;tate of the garri&s;on &s;hewed the impo&s;&s;ibility of defending the place any con&s;ider|able time, it was certainly my duty to make it co&s;t the enemy as much blood, and gain as much glory to his Maje&s;ty's arms as was po&s;&s;ible; the rea&s;on for only partially defending the outworks are &s;pecified in the &s;econd council of war, which will, I hope, ju&s;tify me to this court.</P>
<P>If the enemy had made this much wi&s;hed for attack on the lunette, the mines, fouga&s;&s;es, and &s;tone mortars, would not have been idle.</P>
<P>The accu&s;er, &s;o early as the 9th of January, declared, in a letter to me, that, in ten days the Marlborough ought to be abandoned, that key of the garri&s;on, which being once in the power of the enemy, the po&s;&s;ibility of receiving &s;uc|cours from England was at an end; and, in my opinion, the enemy's approaches on that &s;ide might then have been rapid and fatal.</P>
<P>From all which the cen&s;uring the &s;oldier-like plan of defending the Lunettes by chicane, be|comes more inexcu&s;able in the pro&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Fourth.</HI></P>
<P>As my acquittal or condemnation mu&s;t chiefly turn upon this material and affecting charge, I beg the court to examine rigidly every particular ex|hibited on the occa&s;ion to the council of war; by this examination they will &s;ee my rea&s;ons for pro|po&s;ing to &s;urrender, and the unanimous opinion of that council &s;o to do, I mu&s;t not, on this occa&s;ion, pa&s;s in &s;ilence; my &s;urpri&s;e that Major-General Pringle &s;hould in&s;inuate blame in my conduct at that council, he being one of tho&s;e who, una&s;k|ed, advi&s;ed me to propo&s;e to the Duc de Crillon a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, and a conditional &s;urrender, 19 days before, and previous to the inveterate di&s;ea&s;e, which reduced us to the impo&s;&s;ibility of re&s;i&s;ting longer. This honourable court and all the world will e&s;tabli&s;h the cen&s;ure where it &s;hould fall. If the calamity of my garri&s;on was exaggerated, or made a pretence for &s;urrender|ing St. Philip's; if any attempt was made by me to deceive the council, to concur in giving that advice to their governor, the mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hment &s;hould ju&s;tly fall to my lot. If, on the contrary, our misfortune was real, and be|yond the power of men to remedy, I and my advi&s;ers de&s;erve applau&s;e from their country. Hu|manity will plead for it as our due; nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t ju&s;tify it. How far it was becoming Sir William Draper, the in&s;tigator of this previous advice to &s;urrender on conditional terms the 14th of January, to accu&s;e me criminally for &s;urren|dering on the 4th of February, after this inve|terate calamity had made an ho&s;pital of my gar|ri&s;on, and a &s;pectacle, con&s;idering our circum|&s;tances, which would have convinced the mo&s;t obdurate heart, the court and Europe will de|termine. I &s;hall &s;hew this was the ca&s;e, and I &s;hall prove beyond contradiction, when the date of the paper given to Colonel Pringle, by Sir William Draper is con&s;idered, and the contents of that paper, advi&s;ing the treating with the enemy for a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, which were com|municated to the &s;aid council of war, that &s;uch was even at that time the opinion of my accu&s;er; my letter to the officers upon receiving this advice, will &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the di&s;po&s;ition of my mind, and my determined purpo&s;e of holding out the fort as long as re|&s;i&s;tance could be effectual; but when overcome by this di&s;po&s;ition of providence again&s;t all my efforts, I acknowledge, that for the chance of keeping the fortre&s;s three or four days longer at the mo&s;t, I could not &s;uffer &s;o many brave
<PB N="93" REF="99">men to peri&s;h, who had merited every return of good offices from me and their country, when it was in my power to &s;ave their lives by obtain|ing vegetables and fre&s;h air.</P>
<P>If the accu&s;er would have made a longer de|fence, the honor he might have gained would have been dearly purcha&s;ed by the lives of num|bers, who mu&s;t have fallen by the hand of heaven, not that of the enemy? would any ho|ne&s;t man purcha&s;e honor at &s;o dear a rate?</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Fifth.</HI></P>
<P>If I had given out the orders mentioned in the charge, to march out the corps as weak as po&s;&s;ible, it would have been no crime in me to le&s;&s;en the triumph of the enemy, but the fact was, that by the Duc de Crilion's letter of the enemy, of the 4th of February 1782, the troops were to march to Alleyor, which is eleven miles from the ca&s;tle, and the enemy's general de&s;ired that &s;uch of the garri&s;on, as from weakne&s;s were unable to march to Alleyor, might, as well as the &s;ick and convale&s;cents, remove to George Town, till they were able to join their re&s;pec|tive corps; but the whole of the&s;e men, except the &s;ick and convale&s;cents, &s;o far as belonged to the four regular corps, were included with the effectives in the return inclo&s;ed to the Secretary of State, and were al&s;o included in the numbers &s;tated in my letter to him, as appears by the original returns, which have already been laid before the Court.</P>
<P>It is true, that in that letter the number of the marine corps is mentioned to be 200, where|as the real number of effectives, rank and file, on the 2d of February, were 424, including boys, artificers, and 93 men, reported to be &s;corbutic by the &s;urgeons, and who probably would all be in the ho&s;pital in a few days; and in the &s;ame letter, the number of artillery was &s;tated to be 120; whereas the real number of the effectives, rank and file, were, on the 31&s;t of January, 104. The&s;e two errors in the numbers, by one of which the number of &s;eamen is &s;tated too low, and by the other the number of artillery too high, aro&s;e in the following manner. When I made the rough draft of my letter, to the Secretary of State, I put down the name of each corps, among which the marine corps, Cor&s;icans, Greeks and Algerines are particularly mentioned, leaving a blank after each, to be filled up by the Adju|tant general from the returns; he accordingly filled them up, but was lead into a mi&s;take as to the marine corps, by a return delivered to him, on the 30th of January, by the adjutant of the &s;aid corps, in which return the numbers, rank and file, are &s;tated to be 316; and from this erroncous return, the adjutant general deducted the boys, and the men returned on the &s;ick li&s;t, between 30th of January and 5th of February, and in&s;erted the balance, as the true number; he error as to the artillery men, aro&s;e from the adjutant general's re&s;erring by mi&s;take to a pre|ceeding return in&s;tead of the la&s;t; but it is evident from the two mi&s;takes, being on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, that there could be no po&s;&s;ible intention to deceive, neither could the Secretary of State be mi&s;led by the&s;e mi&s;takes, &s;ince the minutes of the council of war, of the 3d of February, were laid before him, with my letter, in which minutes I &s;tated the number of the marine corps, rank and file, deducting the boys, at 389, which was the exact number; the Cor&s;icans, Greeks and Algerines, are &s;tated in that letter according to the returns; and therefore the charge is not true that they were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>C. <HI>Charge the Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This idea of retaining ho&s;tages in our debili|tated &s;tate, or waiting a moment in relieving the &s;ick after the preliminaries had been &s;igned, is &s;o contrary to the principles which induced me to &s;urrender, that it would have been both u&s;ele&s;s and cruel to have deferred the e&s;&s;ential bu&s;ine&s;s for that ceremony; and after my di&s;tre&s;s was known to the enemy, the be&s;t &s;ecurity was, a generous conduct, tru&s;ting to the honour of a &s;oldier, which was given. All the articles were fulfilled; and why my accu&s;er &s;hould be an|gry about ho&s;tages, I cannot conceive; I &s;hall call no evidence about this: the trivial lo&s;&s;es which the officers &s;u&s;tained by the irregular con|duct of the Spani&s;h troops, in forcing the &s;ouf guards, placed over the baggage of the different regiments, was amply paid, according to the e&s;timates they delivered, as has been proved, and whatever Colonel Pringle may think of twelve hours notice, as nece&s;&s;ary for marching his regiment, I conceived then, as I do now, that it was my duty to get the troops into fre&s;h air, and &s;upplied with vegetables, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>At the time the wool was purcha&s;ed for government, I had every rea&s;on to expect a vigorous and immediate attack, and in that ca&s;e we could not take down the u&s;ele&s;s buildings with that care which was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave the cantoon &s;tones. There were not enough of the&s;e in the ditches, to &s;erve the mines alone; &s;uch as were intended for this purpo&s;e, having been otherwi&s;e employed (whil&s;t the Lieutenant Governor commanded in the fort,) in erecting u&s;ele&s;s barbet batteries, every thing that could &s;upply the materials for making the traver&s;es became an acqui&s;ition. The chief engineer de|clared
<PB N="94" REF="100">to Lieutenant Dougla&s;s, my aid-de-camp, that we were happy to get the wool; and the proper place to put it in, was the top of the ca&s;tle, as the &s;afe&s;t, and being centrical, it could mo&s;t conveniently be moved from thence to where it might be wanted; I therefore ordered it to be valued by merchants, who fixed the price at five dollars per quintal; I then ordered the quarter-ma&s;ter general, to acquaint the agents of privateers, that if they would not lower it, their wool would be returned to them, it was accordingly lowered, to three dollars per quin|tal, at which price, (after having &s;tood the wea|ther for &s;ix months, and being &s;cattered and dirtied by the &s;hells) the Spaniards &s;old it when the ca&s;tle came into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This will &s;hew that no unju&s;t or inordinate price was given; but I mu&s;t remark, even in &s;uch a $mple tran&s;action as this, before the Court, that my accu&s;er cannot charge me, without dealing in amplification; for the wool in que&s;tion, co&s;t only 763 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in&s;tead of 900 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> as &s;tated by Sir William Draper. This has been proved by the witne&s;&s;es he called.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>The hou&s;e at Stanhope's Tower, was built at the expence of goverment, and all repairs want|ed to it were put in the yearly e&s;timates &s;ent home to the board of ordnance, as has been pro|ved by Captain Town&s;end. The thing com|plained of in this charge, was the employing about &s;ix men for a few weeks, in repairing the walls of a poultry yard, &s;even months before the inva&s;ion. The Court will perceive the &s;pirit which has actuated my accu&s;er, when he could &s;tate &s;uch a trivial matter as a &s;olemn charge again&s;t the <HI>Governor of Minorca,</HI> and bring evi|dence upon it, before &s;eventeen general officers.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>The marine corps was compo&s;ed of the pri|&s;oners of war, which were exchanged from France, before a cartel had been &s;ettled; the agreement I had made with the enemy, was &s;o much approved of by the King's &s;ervice, as to continue in force by the cartel, while we were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Minorca.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;All pri&s;oners taken in America, or in any part of the world, and carried into the domi|nions of one or the other power in Europe, &s;hall enjoy the benefit of this agreement; and it &s;hall be left to the good faith of the nations to adju&s;t, according to the regulations of this agreement, the exchanges which may have been carried on by virtue of any cartel already entered into by the Governor of Minorea: and any per&s;ons duly authori&s;ed on the part of France re&s;pecting pri&s;oners brought to that I&s;land, and into the French ports in the Mediterranean, and to obviate all difficulties re&s;pecting &s;uch pri&s;oners, the ex|change of whom it is intended &s;hall be com|pleated in the &s;aid ports in the Mediterranean; proper orders &s;hall be given as conveniently can be, after the ratification of this cartel, for their being accordingly reciprocally re|lea&s;ed and exchanged from time to time, without regard either to their number or qua|lities; and for the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of proper cer|tificates from the re&s;pective agents, and com|mi&s;&s;ioners of both nations, in order that the balance of the general account of exchanges &endq;may be duly adju&s;ted between us.</Q></P>
<P>It is well known that the garri&s;on of Minorca, even in point of numbers, was one regiment le&s;s than the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment; and that the two Briti&s;h regiments were compo&s;ed of worn out invalids, as has been already &s;hewn by Sir Wil|liam Draper's report of the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>I had authority from the King to do what I could to &s;upply our wants in men, &amp;c. which could not be &s;pared from the pre&s;&s;ing calls of other &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The exchanged pri&s;oners were a natural and happy re&s;ource, but we could not have availed our&s;elves of it, had not &s;ome of them been em|ployed at &s;ea, with the chance of getting prize money: every body knows the attempts that were made to intice the&s;e men from the fort, and not only the privateers, but even the King's &s;hips, threw out the lure; they will be &s;hewn by Sir William Draper's complaint to Lord Sandwich upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The be&s;t expedient at that time we could think of to &s;atisfy the minds of the &s;eamen, and to make them a part of our&s;elves, was to man two &s;mall privateers with &s;ome of them; the&s;e were or &s;hould have been relieved every cruize, or the prize money divided among&s;t the whole; Lieutenant Colonel Ca&s;e, who had the direc|tion of &s;uch matters, has declared not only the arrangements he made in that re&s;pect, but the nece&s;&s;ity of giving a chance of prize money to the men of the marine corps. Tho&s;e &s;erving on board were certainly paid and victualled, as the others were on &s;hore out of the magazines of the garri&s;on; that I had authority to do this mu&s;t be admitted; I tru&s;t the mea&s;ure will be judged proper and expedient; it certainly was not done without the approbation of the Lieu|tenant Governor, who had the corps under his immediate command and protection, as he did them the honour to be their Colonel without pay.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="101">
<P>When the mea&s;ure was fir&s;t concerted, I con|&s;ulted him about it, we were in perfect harmony and friend&s;hip; had he thought it improper, he would have &s;ignified his di&s;approabation both to the king in his report, and to my&s;elf. The only privateers we manned were the Lemon ad|vice boat, or Xavagor, and the General Mur|ray privateer; they were upon all occa&s;ions ready to execute my commands, and to be &s;ent to Gibraltar or any part of the Mediterranean, to collect my intelligence, and keep our commu|nication with Italy.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els, and I believe the arms, were the property of individuals; I declare upon my ho|nour I had no &s;hare in them, or any other pri|vateer, further than as follows:</P>
<P>When it was expedient to employ the General Murray, as I have expre&s;&s;ed, and there was a difficulty to find adventurers to purcha&s;e and fit out the &s;hip, I a&s;ked Sir William Draper if he would not take a &s;hare in her, he replied he had not money to &s;pare; I then depo&s;ited 1000 dollars in the name of Sir William Draper's two daughters; and Mr. M'Neille, and Mr. Ca&s;e, know that every formality of law was done in inve&s;ting them with the property, and putting it out of my power to claim a &s;hilling had &s;he taken prizes: This &s;hip was &s;unk, and paid for; Mr. Ca&s;e returned me the 1000 dollars in Janu|ary, which I received without attempting to force a favour on Sir William, that might have expo&s;ed me to in&s;ult.</P>
<P>As our garri&s;on daily grew weaker, and I was told it was impo&s;&s;ible to reinforce it from England; it became my duty to &s;ecure for our defence as many Engli&s;h &s;eamen as I could; with that view I agreed to victual and pay the men of the Hannah, a privateer from England, and tho&s;e of the Eagle, one from Scotland, and which was only about three weeks, provided they would &s;tick by us, and throw their crews into the fort in ca&s;e of its being attacked; they both fulfilled their agreement, and I appeal to the court, if this can be called embezzling or mi&s;applying the public &s;tores: if I had any &s;hares in tho&s;e privateers, it would not have been with|out a pre&s;ident. Lord <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> when at the head of the admiralty, was a principal owner in two privateers; but be&s;ides the right of hold|ing a &s;hare, tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els became ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for our protection.</P>
<P>The Generals Wolfe, Moncton, Lord Town&s;end, and my&s;elf, at the de&s;ire of Admi|ral Saunders, purcha&s;ed a ve&s;&s;el which was armed and victualled by the &s;tores and ammuni|tion of the fleet, and none of us thought we had done wrong, till the ve&s;&s;el was ca&s;t away, and we had lo&s;t our money.</P>
<P>The evidence of Lieutenant Ca&s;e, and the que&s;tions put by Sir William Draper on this &s;ubject, evidently &s;hew the di&s;po&s;itions of jea|lou&s;y and di&s;content which were prevalent in Sir William Draper's mind, when I conceived the &s;tricte&s;t harmony to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us; and this will account for his &s;ub&s;equent conduct, when tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions broke out with &s;uch violences.</P>
<P>Before I fini&s;h this article, I mu&s;t remark, though it is not applicable to the charge, that Captain <HI>Stewi&s;on</HI> has declared in his evidence, that having &s;ailed with di&s;patches, he purpo&s;ely returned to communicate to me &s;ome intelligence re&s;pecting the &s;ailing of the enemy's fleet; I &s;hall prove that he returned an account of a mutiny again&s;t him, and I declare if he brought any &s;uch intelligence, it was &s;o perfectly vague, that it was not even reported to me, or made any impre&s;&s;ion upon any of the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Fourth.</HI></P>
<P>At the time the Hannah privateer (which came into the harbour after the blockade) was bought by the inaction of the enemy, none of who&s;e motions could yet be perceived, a block|ade was to be expected; it became my duty, being authori&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty to do every thing which I thought proper for the defence of the place, to purcha&s;e in to the &s;ervice of government, a ve&s;&s;el of force, which might carry any di&s;|patches to and from the Continent, and bring &s;uch recruits as could be rai&s;ed in Italy for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the garri&s;on; &s;o nece&s;&s;ary was this found, that two other ve&s;&s;els were afterwards pur|cha&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters at Florence; for the &s;ame purpo&s;e by orders from government, the Hannah was purcha&s;ed by a valuation of ho|ne&s;t men, as will be &s;een by their report, and at a much cheaper rate than either of the ve&s;&s;els abovementioned; &s;he has &s;ince that been com|mi&s;&s;ioned by the admiralty, and a lieutenant ap|pointed to command her, and, with the other two, has been employed &s;ince the &s;urrender of Minorca, in carrying refre&s;hments and recruits to the garri&s;on of Gibraltar, and is now arrived at <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> The only objection which my accu&s;er has been able to &s;tate again&s;t this mea&s;ure, is that another ve&s;&s;el, the St. Antonio Depadua, might have been hired at a cheaper rate than the purcha&s;e of the Hannah, but it has appeared by the evidence, that he was by no means equally fit for the purpo&s;e; and as the Hannah was intended for, and has been &s;ince employed in a variety of &s;ervices,
<PB N="96" REF="102">her being purcha&s;ed at that time has been a very con&s;iderable &s;aving to government.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Fifth.</HI></P>
<P>When the garri&s;on was inve&s;ted, the num|ber of officers of the &s;everal ranks were inade|quate to the duty, though I rendered it as ea&s;y as could be, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the place, as will appear by the ro&s;ter of the four regiments who did duty as one corps.</P>
<P>Captain Law&s;on, of his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop Mi|norca, was, by the embodying of the marine corps, rai&s;ed to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the garri&s;on; he, from that rank, di&s;puted the authority of the commanding officer of artillery, to whom the marine corps were to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant. It became nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e that officer (who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion, as major, preceded that of captain Law&s;on's, as ma&s;ter and commander,) to a &s;u|perior rank, and this promotion naturally car|ried with it tho&s;e of three elder majors in the garri&s;on; before that time a colonel being thought nece&s;&s;ary to command the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> inner line, lieutenant-colonel Acklom had the tem|porary rank given him for that purpo&s;e; colo|nel Brew&s;e's getting the rank, he being an elder officer, was of con&s;equence; Majors de Gruben, and de Backar, being &s;ick, two others were appointed to that rank, to command the Hanoverian line.</P>
<P>Thus the promotions in the garri&s;on are ac|counted for; but had no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, (authorized as I have &s;hewn I then was) there was no method more likely to encourage the exertions of the officers of the garri&s;on, than by giving the elde&s;t of each rank a temporary promotion, which, if the defence was glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful, they had rea&s;on to hope would be confirmed by his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>And it was certainly better to pay tho&s;e offi|cers for the rank in which they had acted, than to allow that money to fall into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>E. <HI>Charge the Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The whole of this tran&s;action appears in my letter to Mr. Robin&s;on, and the papers there|with tran&s;mitted. Had not the guineas been e&s;tabli&s;hed at 24 pi&s;tereens, the i&s;land would, in a &s;hort time, have been de&s;titute of circula|ting &s;pecie; I am confident it was no detriment to the troops or inhabitants, nor did I ever hear that either officer or &s;oldier found fault with it: the guinea continues to pa&s;s for the &s;ame, not only at Mahon but at Majorca; I could reap no advantage from it, government alone was the gainer. All the public accounts are made up in dollars, and government was credited 24 pi&s;tereens for the guinea, as will be &s;een by my warrant to the ma&s;ter, and the quarter-ma&s;ter general's accounts.</P>
<P>The accu&s;er errs in a&s;&s;erting that a guinea was ordered to pa&s;s for 24 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> and this is another in&s;tance of that wonderful &s;tretch of fancy, when I am to be accu&s;ed; for 24 pi&s;tereens are at an average, no more than 1 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and one fifth. This matter which I conceived, after the be&s;t advice and con&s;ideration, to be a nece&s;|&s;ary and proper regulation for preventing that drain of &s;pecie, which the merchants were in|duced to make, having been referred to the lords of the trea&s;ury, it was for their lord&s;hip's to correct the mea&s;ure, if they judged it im|proper.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingularly hard that this &s;hould be made a charge, with the exaggeration, that the offi|cers and &s;oldiers were hurt by it; when it cer|tainly prevented the ri&s;e of the exchange upon the officers, who were obliged to draw on Eng|land for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I &s;hall de&s;ire the pay|ma&s;ter may be examined, to declare how much pains I took on all occa&s;ions to accommodate the officers, and lower the exchange; and this, among other rea&s;ons, was a cau&s;e of i&s;&s;uing the proclamation in que&s;tion, to oblige the mer|chants to covet bills rather than &s;pecie.</P>
<P>F. <HI>Charge the Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Since the treaty of Utrecht, the Minorquins have not been intitled to bear arms. They were di&s;armed upon the fir&s;t taking the i&s;land, and af|terwards by general Kayne, general Wynwa$d, and lord Blakeny.</P>
<P>By the eleventh article of the governor's in|&s;tructions, the governor has authority, if he judges it nece&s;&s;ary, to di&s;arm the inhabitants.</P>
<P>In March 1780, having had information that flat bottom boats were building at Barcelona, Carthagena, &amp;c. and an attack de&s;igned to be made upon the i&s;land in the &s;pring, and having made repeated trials whether the inhabitants would defend the i&s;land again&s;t the enemy, and found that they were in no wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed &s;o to do: the inhabitants of Cuitadella, it is true, in the year 1778, applied for a reinforcement to defend them again&s;t the enemy's privateers; and I had &s;ent them an officer, drummer and twelve men, and four pieces of cannon, &amp;c. and re|commended it to them to rai&s;e 57 men for the defence of their own town, in the nature of a militia, under all proper encouragement, to be commanded by Don Pa&s;queda; and though I i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for that purpo&s;e, and af|terwards enforced it by my letter of the 11th of September following, and offered, that in ca&s;e there was any objection to Don Pa&s;queda, that
<PB N="97" REF="103">I would approve their choice of another; yet this little corps could never be rai&s;ed in the principal town in the i&s;land. It is true Don Pa&s;queda got about 30 men of the 57, but even they, in April 1780, refu&s;ed to obey orders and de&s;erted.</P>
<P>I had likewi&s;e propo&s;ed the rai&s;ing a Minor|quin corps of 500 men, to &s;erve in ca&s;e of in|va&s;ion, who were not to be employed out of the i&s;land, intimating that tho&s;e who were not en|gaged in &s;upport of this corps would be de|prived of their arms.</P>
<P>The Dons made many difficulties to carry this propo&s;al into execution, and nothing was done therein.</P>
<P>Another propo&s;al was &s;et on foot on the 26th of April, 1778; and on the 2d of May, 1778, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued by me for rai&s;ing a corps of 500 artificers, bakers, &amp;c. to go into the works in ca&s;e the place was be&s;ieged; which, on the 25th of February, 1779, I informed by another proclamation, i&s;&s;ued for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, with all fitting encouragement.</P>
<P>On the 2d of Augu&s;t, 1779, I made fre&s;h propo&s;itions to rai&s;e a corps of workmen, and</P>
<P>On the 3d of Augu&s;t following, I i&s;&s;ued a proclamation in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>On the 18th of September following, Don Pa&s;queda wrote me word, that not one per&s;on had offered his &s;ervice, and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e this corps, from the great di&s;inclination of the Minorquins had to enter into his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>From the unwillingne&s;s of the inhabitants to take arms, and the circum&s;tances of the war with Spain, to which nation the inhabitants &s;trongly retained their attachment, and know|ing the influence that their <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> had over them, and finding that they encouraged and &s;ecreted the de&s;erters in &s;pite of all I could do to have them delivered up, notwith&s;tanding my repeated proclamation, i&s;&s;ued 18th July, 1778, and 24th December, 1779, with the advice and under the authority of the civil magi&s;trates, two of which de&s;erters have been &s;ecreted above two years in the i&s;land: and finding, that not|with&s;tanding my repeated orders and remon|&s;trances, from the beginning of the war to that time, they, to di&s;tre&s;s the garri&s;on, had with|held the u&s;ual and nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of wood, without which they well knew the garri&s;on, if be&s;ieged, could not exi&s;t: I thought it pru|dent, and hope the Court will think it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to di&s;arm them; and the method I took for that purpo&s;e, was to make u&s;e of the pretence of &s;earching for the de&s;erters, and which was favoured by my having received infor|mation in December 1779, that the two de&s;er|ters who had been &s;o long &s;ecreted, were &s;een in the i&s;land; but that no formalities might be wanted, I fir&s;t directed an officer under the bailiff of Mahon to &s;earch for them.</P>
<P>I i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons to give aid, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or advice to de&s;erters, and to give information under penalties.</P>
<P>I cau&s;ed a circular letter to be wrote to all the univer&s;ities, that I intended to &s;end out a party of 200 Engli&s;h &s;eamen to &s;earch for the de&s;erters, recommending them to call together the country people, and giving them eight days further time.</P>
<P>The orders for making a general &s;earch for the de&s;erters were i&s;&s;ued, and the civil officers directed to attend.</P>
<P>The next day warrants, &s;ealed up, were i&s;&s;ued to the commanding officers, commanding the corps that were to make the &s;earch, to execute tho&s;e orders on the 3d of February, and to di&s;|arm the individuals of their fire arms; at the &s;ame time, taking li&s;ts of the arms, and to lodge them &s;afely, which was done.</P>
<P>Not having intended that the &s;mall &s;words &s;hould be taken away, on the 9th of February, 1780, I ordered them to be returned to the in|habitants, which were taken by mi&s;take, and the &s;ame day I recalled the troops; and on Fe|bruary the 12th, I wrote to the Dons and prin|cipal inhabitants of Cuitadella in the polite&s;t terms, that I was extremely &s;orry to find that they had been deprived of their &s;words, entirely owing to my order being mi&s;under&s;tood; and on the 19th of February, 1779, I ordered both fu&s;ees and &s;words to be returned to the principal inhabitants of Cuitadella; and the &s;ame day complaints having been made of damage done to individuals by the &s;ailors, I ordered enquiries to be made, and the depo&s;itions of all who had any complaints to be taken.</P>
<P>I i&s;&s;ued another proclamation for all per&s;ons that had received damage to give in their com|plaints, that they might receive ample ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I i&s;&s;ued another proclamation, which men|tioned that only eight per&s;ons had complained of injuries, and limiting the time to twelve days from that day.</P>
<P>And the inhabitants of Merixdal, having de|livered an account of their damages, were re|imbur&s;ed to the amount of about 500 dollars.</P>
<P>Whatever opinion mankind might have formed of the act of di&s;arming, at the moment when no danger was pre&s;&s;ing, and where humanity naturally inclined again&s;t every act of &s;everity upon a contingent event, and where no re&s;pon|&s;ibility lay with the per&s;ons expre&s;&s;ing their opinions; yet as the faithle&s;s conduct of the Minorquins had &s;ince appeared &s;o con&s;picuous after the landing of the enemy, I thought all Engli&s;hmen had never been unanimous in ap|plauding the property of the mea&s;ure. My accu&s;er to this charge might have been &s;hort; I had the power, and I judged it nece&s;&s;ary to examine it; but in an act like this, which was affecting to &s;o many individuals under my government, I wi&s;hed to &s;hew that I had not
<PB N="98" REF="104">u&s;ed any di&s;cretional authority wantonly or op|pre&s;&s;ively. In one charge I am accu&s;ed of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s; in this my vigilance is turned into a crime.</P>
<P>F. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>As I was pa&s;&s;ing through the main ditch, accompanied by Lieutenant Douglas, my aid de camp, I &s;aw a con&s;iderable number of the Spani&s;h pri&s;oners &s;tanding without the door of their places of confinement, their numbers were about 80; they had only one centry over them, and the arms of the guard were about 20 paces from them, piled again&s;t the &s;ide of the ditch. It is true, that vexed to &s;ee them in that &s;itua|tion, I ordered them with &s;ome warmth into their place of confinement; which not being immediately obeyed, I forced them in, and touched one or two of them in the manner which has been de&s;cribed to the court. In the then &s;tate of my health, any &s;trokes of mine could be but of little con&s;equence. Let the faculty and the Prevo&s;t Mar&s;hal be examined, whether the utmo&s;t humanity was not &s;hewn, and the greate&s;t attention paid by me to the health of the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>It were well for my accu&s;er, after having the fact from his own witne&s;s, if he can recollect the per&s;on who had repre&s;ented to him my con|duct in this affair, that he may be induced never to believe him again.</P>
<P>F. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>Jo&s;eph Gaya came into the fort with my pro|mi&s;e, that if we were driven out of the i&s;land I would procure him an employment in England, equal to what he enjoyed in Minorca.</P>
<P>His going every day at 12 o'clock to the top of the ca&s;tle, and &s;ome things being &s;een there that had the appearance of &s;ignals to the enemy, by placing &s;tones on the parapet in particular figures, which was an&s;wered from the Philipet. This gave the fir&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, which was confirmed by a report of the Prevo&s;t-Mar|tial, who &s;tated that Gaya lived con&s;tantly with Jo&s;eph Sara, a Minorquin pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle Square; and that contrary to my orders, he carried that Sara &s;everal times about the fort with him.</P>
<P>I therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary to confine him, as from his being perfectly acquainted with every part of the garri&s;on, as he might have been materially detrimental to me if he had made his e&s;cape, which it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to prevent, if he had been left at large.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Dougla&s;s went to him at my de|&s;ire, to acquaint him that he was only confined upon &s;u&s;picion, and that if nothing was proved again&s;t him on our going out of the fort, either being driven out of it on the &s;iege being rai&s;ed, he might depend on the performance of my promi&s;e, that in the mean time his pay &s;hould be continued to him, and he &s;hould be &s;ed out of my kitchen, &s;hould have the liberty of walk|ing twice in the day on the top of the ca&s;tle, under charge of one of my orderly &s;erjeants, for the &s;ake of his health. His de&s;troying him|&s;elf could therefore only be occa&s;ioned by his being con&s;cious of his guilt, of which indeed there is the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption; a plan of the works having been found in his trunk, as appears by the evidence of Mr. Prevo&s;t Mar&s;hal. Mr. Potter, has declared that he has been &s;ince informed of Gaya's having actually given intelligence to the enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Sir George Howard, and the General Officers of the Court Martial.</HI></P>
<P>I have fini&s;hed the evidence, which I have thought nece&s;&s;ary to call in my defence; and, as far as I am capable of judging in my own cau&s;e, there is nothing which now remains to be cleared up, in order to enable the court to pa&s;s that &s;entence which their ju&s;tice and their wi&s;dom &s;hall direct, except with regard to the following particulars.</P>
<P>In my an&s;wer to the fir&s;t article of the charge A, I a&s;&s;ert, that I could not be &s;urprized, and in a letter to Lord Barrington the Secretary of War, in the year 1776, reque&s;ting barracks might be built in the fort for $he troops, which letter I have produced in evidence; I &s;ay, no place, <Q>I ever &s;aw is more liable to be &startq;&endq;&s;urpri&s;ed than Fort St. Philip's.</Q> Now it has been alledged, with an eager precipitation, by my accu&s;er, that in the&s;e two a&s;&s;ertions there is an evident contradiction but if the court will be plea&s;ed to attend to the time of the year, (viz.) the winter month February 1780, &s;tated in the charge, they will find there is no contradiction whatever when the two a&s;&s;ertions are con&s;idered with a reference to that period.</P>
<P>I admit we were liable to a po&s;&s;ible &s;upri&s;e in the &s;ummer, by flat boats or row gallies from Barcelona and Majorca; but I deny that we were &s;o in February, 1780; when &s;uch ve&s;&s;els could not venture to carry troops in tho&s;e &s;eas; and I had at that time, as I have already ob|&s;erved, particular intelligence that there were no preparations in readine&s;s at the&s;e places for &s;uch an enterpri&s;e; but whenever I thought a &s;urpri&s;e was po&s;&s;ible, I went into the fort my|&s;elf, with all the officers, namely, in the end of March and beginning of April of that very year, as has been proved to the court.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remark, that there has appeared to the court a difference between a return of the 51&s;t regiment, dated the 1&s;t of February, 1782, and &s;ent by Colonel Pringle to the Adjutant-General, accompanied with a note of com|plaint, that the regiment could not relieve the guards (which note and return have both been authenticated by Colonel Pringle) and and another return of the &s;aid regiment pro|duced in evidence by Colonel Pringle, which was made to him by his own directions at Al|layor
<PB N="99" REF="105">a few days after the &s;urrender, by which the regiment appears to be &s;tronger.</P>
<P>The only ob&s;ervation I &s;hall make to this point is, that the phy&s;ician general, and the adjutant of the 51&s;t regiment have both prov|ed to the court, that from the 1&s;t of February, until the &s;urrender, there were above 40 men of that regiment obliged by &s;ickne&s;s to go into the ho&s;pitals; and therefore the difference of the&s;e two returns mu&s;t have ari&s;en from &s;ome mi&s;take of colonel Pringle's.</P>
<P>It has appeared that Mr. Bayne, the aucti|oneer, made a mi&s;take again&s;t him&s;elf in the ac|count he delivered to Sir William Draper, by giving credit for about 4 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for goods &s;old by him, which were not prize goods. This mi&s;|take I declare e&s;caped me, becau&s;e I never ex|amined that account; if I had, I certainly would have corrected the error, having no right, as vice-admiral, to any thing but the moiety of the one and a half per cent. upon the &s;ale of prize goods taken from the enemy.</P>
<P>Sir William Draper having failed to prove his a&s;&s;ertion that I was an adventurer in the priva|teers, has attempted to in&s;inuate that the [vice-admiral's f$e on the &s;ale of the prizes, made me concerned in them, he may with as much rea&s;on &s;ay, I contributed to &s;it out, man, and victual his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war, which con|demned and &s;old their prizes at Minorca, as they likewi&s;e paid the one and a half per cent. to the auctioneer.</P>
<P>The court have before them what things were left to be executed by Sir William Draper, when I gave him the temporary command of the fort; and what part of the&s;e things were executed by him; they are to decide whether it would not have been of more utility to have carried the&s;e into execution, than to have made barbet batteries, which were not once fired after the enemy open|ed their batteries, and few of them before. To make the&s;e barbets at the &s;alliant angles of the inner covered way, the glacis was lowered, and the adjoining branches of the covered way ren|dered untenable, even if we had had troops to defend them. The chief engineer is the be&s;t judge if this was proper, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>It is laid to my charge that none of the mines had been &s;prung before the &s;urrender, the court are the be&s;t judges; it has been already proved by Colonel Brew&s;e that if they had been &s;prung at that time, they could have done no harm to the enemy. It was always my opinion, that the only time for &s;pringing the mines under the outward glacis, was when the enemy were making the a&s;&s;ault on the Lunettes, then the enemy's troops, who were immediately engaged in the &s;torm, confounded and di&s;couraged by the explo&s;ion behind them, would naturally have &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e de&s;tined to &s;upport them were de&s;troyed by it. Had they even re|covered that confu&s;ion they could &s;carcely have e&s;caped an unavoidable de&s;truction from the blowing up of the Lunettes; and if even that had failed, their advantage (from the galleries of communication being mined) could have only extended to the work of which they had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e, with many other re&s;ources, are what I meant in my report to his Maje&s;ty, by defending the place by chicanes; let me fall or &s;tand by the ju&s;tice of the&s;e ideas, I hazard them to the court, and I hazard them to all Europe.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned that the officers of the four regular regiments were in much better health than the private men; this is ea&s;ily ac|counted for, the &s;oldiers had all of them, (viz.) the Briti&s;h, for eleven years, lived on &s;alt pro|vi&s;ions. The quantity of vegetables they con|&s;umed, and the wine they drank, though it prevented the immediate effect of the &s;curvy, could not hinder it from tainting the blood. The officers had, until we were inve&s;ted, lived intirely on fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and even after that we were confined to the fort, had wine, and other refre&s;hments bought at their own expence. They likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the day in the quarters of the ca&s;tle &s;quare, and were only in the night confined to the damp air of the Souderreins; but even the officers, with all tho&s;e advantages, began to be infected.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;ked, whether fire balls were u&s;ed in the defence, and proved they were, but they were only employed when they could be u&s;eful. They could not be thrown at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight hundred yards; the enemy's batteries were at that di&s;tance from us; a fire ball mu&s;t go beyond the object to di&s;cover it, of cour&s;e tho&s;e thrown by us could not di|rect our fire upon the enemy's batteries, but even if we could have thrown them &s;o far, it would have been of no &s;ervice, as they mu&s;t have been lo&s;t in the hollows, which were ju&s;t behind the&s;e batteries; &s;uch as we threw were intended to di&s;cover the enemy's engineers, marking out their intended approaches, or the parties they frequently &s;ent to fire upon our out|works, and to a&s;&s;ure our men that nothing could advance upon us without di&s;covery: we had originally but one hundred carca&s;es, &s;ome of them were expended in our attempts to de|&s;troy the burgos battery of the enemy, the re&s;t were re&s;erved for a more important &s;tage of the &s;iege, if the Almighty had permitted us to di&s;|pute our ground.</P>
<P>All Europe will read this trial; the reputation of the Briti&s;h arms will be much affected by the event of it; I mu&s;t not, in fear of any man, or any con&s;equences, neglect laying open every circum&s;tance to the world, by which mankind may judge of our knowledge in the art of war, and of the fundamental principles of our di&s;ci|pline and &s;ubordination. We certainly are not in the &s;tate of Carthage, when every military
<PB N="100" REF="106">commander was di&s;graced becau&s;e he could not perform impo&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>Let the then mini&s;try account for leaving me with 1400 regular privates, worn out men, to defend a fortre&s;s which required at lea&s;t 4000 &s;$out able &s;oldiers; this I always thought they could do, becau&s;e they were pre&s;&s;ed to &s;upply more important objects: but let not me be blamed becau&s;e I was le&s;t a forlorn hope, and did the be&s;t I could; let not the brave officers and men who exerted them&s;elves on the occa&s;ion, be bla&s;ted with ignominy, becau&s;e we could not per|form miracles; I had not the powers of Deu|calion; God deprived them of the exertions of Hercules.</P>
<P>As to the tedious hi&s;tory of the value I put upon the guinea, let the Court and the world judge whether I did not do my duty in that re|&s;pect; let both determine what the trea&s;ury means by acquie&s;cence, when they do not chu&s;e to take upon them&s;elves the re&s;pon&s;i|bility.</P>
<P>Sir William Draper has endeavoured to vin|dicate his conduct towards me, on my order of the 15th of October, for re&s;training u&s;ele&s;s &s;iring; but until I was informed by the adju|tant general, captain Don, of his indecent and un&s;oldier-like behaviour, upon my me&s;&s;age of the 11th of November, and that he had quoted this order of the 15th as the cau&s;e for &s;uch ex|traordinary conduct, I had always been made to believe, that the &s;hyne&s;s which he had &s;hewn to me had ari&s;en from &s;ome ill grounded jealou&s;y he had conceived, becau&s;e I had not con&s;ulted with him re&s;pecting our &s;ally upon Cape Moloa, on the 11th of October; but whether it aro&s;e from the one cau&s;e or the other is immaterial to in|ve&s;tigate, &s;ince no commander in chief was ever yet held bound to con&s;ult an inferior officer, upon the orders he may think proper to i&s;&s;ue; he alone is re&s;pon&s;ible for their expediency, and if any &s;ubordinate officer is permitted with im|punity to make the ordinary exerci&s;e of military command, a pretext for reviling his &s;uperior, charged with the defence of a fortre&s;s be&s;ieged by the enemy, thereby endangering the con&s;i|dence the troops &s;hould, more e&s;pecially at that juncture, repo&s;e in the governor, there is an end from that moment of all the di&s;cipline of the &s;ervice: but if after &s;uch contemptuous be|haviour in an inferior officer, he &s;hould find any profe&s;&s;ional countenance in attempting to vindicate him&s;elf, by heaping together a num|ber of groundle&s;s charges again&s;t his command|ing officer, few men of reputation will be hence forward ambitious of &s;erving in the army.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I erred in not putting the lieutenant governor under an arre&s;t, when I received his &s;econd letter of the 16th January 1782; but I hope that error will be forgiven, when every circum&s;tance under which I acted is con&s;idere$$ more e&s;pecially when I declare, that I acted from the conviction that Sir William Draper's private re&s;entment again&s;t me, was &s;o unmerited that it could have no tendency to dimini&s;h the zeal and &s;pirit of the garri&s;on, in the defence of the place, or to weaken that &s;ubordination, which nothing per&s;onal can ever produce in the brea&s;t of a good &s;oldier.</P>
<P>I am afraid the&s;e remarks may appear tedious to the Court, who have already lent me &s;o much of their patience, but I tru&s;t they will make a favourable allowance for the anxiety of an old &s;oldier, in wiping away every &s;tain from his character, after &s;uch a &s;eries of trying &s;ervice as I have endured, without the &s;lighte&s;t impeach|ment of my military conduct.</P>
<P>I now take my final leave of the Court, and whatever may be your judgment, I &s;hall bear a willing and grateful te&s;timony to your fair, can|did, patient, and impartial proceedings; I have no complaint to make of any part of them, or any thing but &s;incere thanks to offer: but if I was of a di&s;po&s;ition to complain of my accu&s;er, I might perhaps indulge it with le&s;s imputation upon either fortitude or moderation, than any other man, military or civil, that ever &s;tood be|fore the judges of his country.</P>
<P>The &s;iege of Fort St. Philip's, without hope of relief, under the difficulties which have ap|peared to the court; the anxious reflection that it mo&s;t probably was the la&s;t military exertion of my life, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering the fort under &s;uch a reflection, was &s;urely in it&s;elf a &s;ufficient mea&s;ure of misfortune, with|out the addition of the &s;tain of public accu&s;al, and the painful proceedings of a public trial. But there is &s;omething here, that tells me rather to rejoice, than to complain, &s;ince it is from this la&s;t circum&s;tance of a public trial, that all my misfortunes can be di&s;pelled, and done away; the time is now come, when I look up to your ju&s;tice, to enable n$e to appear before my coun|try with an unimpeachable te&s;timony, that I did not &s;urrender, while there was any means of re|&s;i&s;tance, and that I was not unde&s;erving the commi&s;&s;ion with which I was honoured by my mo&s;t gracious Sovereign.</P>
