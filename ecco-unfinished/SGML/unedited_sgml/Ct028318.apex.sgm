<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER has read the very entertaining collection of Moral Tales, lately publi&s;hed by M. Marmontel, will immediately di&s;cover, that the fir&s;t hint of this little piece was taken from the epi&s;ode of Lindor, in the SCRUPULE; and the ridiculous conceit of being beloved <HI>for one's own &s;ake, for one's &s;elf alone,</HI> is al&s;o admirably expo&s;ed in the fir&s;t of tho&s;e Tales, called ALCIBIADE, <HI>ou, le</HI> MOI.</P>
<P>That part of the fable which relates to Mademoi&s;elle Florival, is taken, with &s;ome alteration, from a Story, originally publi&s;h|ed in one of the numbers of the Briti&s;h Magazine, and &s;aid to be founded on fact.</P>
<P>After the&s;e acknowledgements, nothing farther remains but to return thanks to the Public for the very favourable reception they have given to this little piece, and to the Performers for their great care and uncommon excellen$$ in the repre&s;enta|tion.</P>

<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, Madam, it is my intere&s;t to make you acquainted with my &s;tory. I am the daughter of Mon&s;ieur Florival, a French phy&s;ician, in the i&s;land of Bellei&s;le.&mdash;An Engli&s;h officer, who had been de&s;perately wounded, was, after the $apitulation, for the &s;ake of due attendance, taken into my father's hou&s;e, and as I, in the very early part of my life, had re&s;ided in Eng|land, he took &s;ome plea&s;ure in my conver&s;ation: In a word, he won my affections, and a&s;ked me of my father in marriage; but he, alas! too much influenced by the narrow prejudices &s;o common between the two nations, forbad the officer his hou&s;e; but not before we were, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements, &s;ecretly con|tracted to each other.</P>

<P>Oh! no, far from it. He was &s;oon recalled by orders from England; and on my father's pre&s;&s;ing me to con&s;ent to another match, my

pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;I blu&s;h to own it&mdash;tran&s;ported me &s;o far, as to depart abruptly from Bellei&s;le. I came over in an Engli&s;h &s;hip to Port&s;mouth, where I expected, according to letters he had contrived to &s;end me, to find the officer. But judge of my di&s;appointment, when I learnt that he embarked but three days before for the &s;iege of the Havannah.</P>

In order to defeat enquiries after me, I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf in this habit, and mixt with the officers of the place; but your brother &s;oon di&s;covered my unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;aw through my di&s;gui&s;e.

<P>Lord, Emily, how can you torment your&s;elf with &s;uch horrid imaginations? Be&s;ides, &s;hould the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t&mdash;it is but a lover lo&s;t, and that is a lo&s;s ea&s;ily repaired, you know.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, you mad-cap! but you'll pay for all this one day, I warrant you. When you come $o be heartily in for it your&s;elf, Bell, you will know that when a pure and di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion fills the brea&s;t, when once a woman has &s;et her heart upon a man, nothing in the world but that very man will ever make her happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire your <HI>&s;etting your heart,</HI> as you call it, of all things. Your love, my dear Emily, is not &s;o romantick. You pitch upon a man of figure and fortune, hand&s;ome, &s;en&s;ible, good|natured, and well-bred; of rank in life, and credit in his profe&s;&s;ion; a man that half the wo|men in town would pull caps for, and then you talk like, a &s;ly prude, of your pure and di&s;inte|re&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, I declare, if he had not a friend on earth, or a &s;hilling in the world&mdash;if he was as mi&s;erable as the utmo&s;t malice of ill fortune could make him, I would prefer Col. Tamper to the fir&s;t duke in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, &s;i&s;ter! it is a mighty ea&s;y thing for per|&s;ons rolling in affluence, and a coach and &s;ix, to talk of living on bread and water, and the comforts of love in a cottage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The coach and &s;ix, Bell, would give little happine&s;s to tho&s;e, who could not be happy without it. When once the heart has &s;ettled its affections, how mean is it to withdraw them from any paltry con&s;iderations of what nature &s;oever!</P>

<P>The two principal wounds which the Colonel received, Madam, were, one a little above the knee, and another in his face. In con&s;equence of the fir&s;t, he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aving his life by the lo&s;s of a leg; and the lat|ter has deprived him of the &s;ight of an eye.</P>

<P>Marriage is precarious, I grant you, and mu&s;t be &s;o. You may play like a wary game&s;ter, 'tis true. I would not marry a notorious profligate, nor a woman in a con&s;umption; but there is no more an&s;wering for the continuance of her good di&s;po&s;ition, than that of her good health.</P>

<P>Very true, Ma'am, very true, that he's going, I promi&s;e you; but not for the recovery of his health; Sir John's well enough him&s;elf, but his affairs are in a galloping con&s;umption, I a&s;&s;ure you. No le&s;s than two executions in his hou&s;e. I heard it for fact at Lady Modi&s;h's. Poor gen|tleman! I have known his chariot &s;tand at Ar|thur's till eight o'clock in the morning. He has had a &s;ad run a long time, but that la&s;t af|fair at Newmarket totally undid him.&mdash;Pray, ladies, have you heard the &s;tory of Alderman Manche&s;ter's lady?</P>

<P>A terrible &s;tory indeed.&mdash;Eloped from her hu&s;band, and went off with Lord John Sprightly. Their intention, it &s;eems, was to go over to Holland; but the Alderman pur&s;ued them to Harwich, and catched them ju&s;t as they were going to embark. He threatened Lord John with a pro&s;ecution, but Lord John, who knew the Alderman's turn, came down with a thou&s;and pounds, and &s;o the Alderman received his wife, and all is well again.</P>

<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I took that method, Madam, to try your truth, con&s;tancy and affection. I have found you void of all tho&s;e qualities, and &s;hall have rea&s;on to rejoice at the effect of my experiment as long as I live.</P>

<P>If you meant to &s;eparate your&s;elf from me, you have indeed taken an excellent method. And a mighty proof you have given of your <HI>own</HI> affection, truly! In&s;tead of returning after an anxious ab&s;ence, with joy into my pre&s;ence, to come home with a low and mean &s;u&s;picion, with a narrow jealou&s;y of my mind, when the frankne&s;s and genero&s;ity of my behaviour ought to have engaged you to repo&s;e the mo&s;t unli|mited confidence in me.</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, I have a long &s;tory to relate. At pre&s;ent let it &s;uffice to &s;ay that, that that Lady's brother has been the noble&s;t of friends to me, and &s;he her&s;elf this morning generou&s;ly vouch|&s;afed to take me under her protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am bound to them for ever. At my return I found letters from your father, who, &s;uppo&s;ing you was in England with me, wrote to acquaint me, that he was incon&s;olable for your lo&s;s, and that he would con&s;ent to our union, if I would but a&s;&s;ure him that you was &s;afe and well.&mdash;The next po&s;t &s;hall acquaint him of our good fortune.&mdash;Well, Tamper! am not I a lucky fellow?</P>
