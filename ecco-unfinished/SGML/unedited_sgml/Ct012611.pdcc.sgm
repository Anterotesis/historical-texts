<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Engli&s;h STAGE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE DRAMA did not &s;o much as grow into any Form in <HI>England</HI>, till the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. It met, indeed, with &s;ome kind of <HI>E&s;|tabli&s;hment</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; but flouri&s;hed in That of King <HI>James</HI> I. Arts were cultivated, till the Beginning of our Inte&s;tine Broils in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I, when the Dramatic Mu&s;e was bani&s;hed, and all the Arts degraded.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of this Work is to give a faithful Account of the Stage and its Pro|gre&s;s;
<PB N="2" REF="6">
and to convey the Names of &s;ome of our mo&s;t eminent Players, to a little longer Date, than Nature has given their Bodies.</P>
<P>But, before we de&s;cend to Particulars, let us, with a noble Peer, take a general View of that Period when MONARCHY was RE|STORED; under which Admini&s;tration the <HI>Drama</HI> was rai&s;ed to its highe&s;t Degree of Perfection.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I behold (&s;ays Lord <HI>Lan&s;downe</HI>) a KING, with a guilty Nation at his Feet, rai&s;ing his Enemies from the Ground, taking them by the Hand as if they had never offend|ed: Sour hypocritical Zeal and Grimace turned, as by Inchantment, all at once into good Humour and open-hearted Chear|fulne&s;s: Maje&s;ty and Splendor in the Court, Decency and Di&s;cipline in the Church, Dig|nity and Conde&s;cen&s;ion in the Nobility, Plenty and Ho&s;pitality in the Country, Opulence in the City, good Nature and good Manners among&s;t all Ranks and Con|ditions of Men; Trade flouri&s;hing, Na|vigation extended, Manufactures improved, Arts and Sciences encouraged, Wit abound|ing, the Mu&s;es re&s;tored, the Gown re&s;pect|ed; and above all, Liberty, <HI>real</HI> Liberty &s;ecured to Perpetuity, by that great Bul|wark the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act. This is the Scene which then pre&s;ented it &s;elf, and &endq;I look back with Plea&s;ure upon it.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lord <HI>Lan&s;downe</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Remarks, &amp;c.</HI> 1732, 4to. pag. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">The STAGE having been always accounted a mo&s;t rational and in&s;tructive Entertainment; has therefore met with all proper En|couragement in the wi&s;e&s;t Governments, and been &s;upported by the wi&s;e&s;t Men. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatre has ri&s;en for a Series of many Years under the Patronage of Princes, and appeared in greater Lu&s;tre than any other; and, what &s;till &s;eems more extraordinary, is, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Writers in the Dramatic way, have been them&s;elves Play|ers; of which SHAKESPEARE and OTWAY are immortal In&s;tances.</P>
<P>I believe, no Nation in the World can boa&s;t of having produced &s;o many excellent <HI>Writers</HI> for the Stage, nor &s;o many inimita|ble <HI>Performers</HI>, as our Own. The Memory of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>; Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Old|field</HI>'s Performances are &s;till fre&s;h among us: And as their Merit rendered them univer&s;al|ly admired, their Lo&s;s is now as univer&s;ally lamented.</P>
<P>But, here it ought to be ob&s;erved, that as Wit, good Sen&s;e, and Politene&s;s were ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the Character and Dignity of the Scene; it was always thought proper to intru&s;t the Management of the Theatre, to Per&s;ons who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be ju&s;tly qualified to judge of all Performances fit to be introduced in that Place; that Works of Genius might meet with &s;uitable
<PB N="4" REF="8">
Encouragement, and Dullne&s;s and Immorality be effectually excluded.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> long had the <HI>Stage</HI> under his Direction; and he, undoubtedly, wanted no Abilities to <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h</HI> Merit; nor have I ever heard that he wanted Inclination to <HI>reward</HI> it. And as eminent as he was allowed to be, yet he thought it, advi&s;eable, and no way un|worthy of him, to join with tho&s;e who were profe&s;&s;ed Players. And of late Years Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, as they were all eminent in their Profe&s;&s;ions, as Ac|tors; their own Intere&s;t, as well as the <HI>Hon|our</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI>, made them indu&s;trious to &s;upport it in full Credit. The <HI>two</HI> former of the&s;e Patentees are dead; and &s;o is that Envy which pur&s;ued them in their Lives. We have now no Memory for their <HI>Failings</HI>, and only retain the plea&s;ing Remembrance of their various <HI>Excellencies</HI>.</P>
<P>From the&s;e general Ob&s;ervations then, we may perceive, that it hath been always thought e&s;&s;ential to the Pre&s;ervation of the Stage, and the Encouragement of Authors, to have the management of the Theatre com|mitted to proper Per&s;ons, who had given &s;ome Public Proof of their Capacity to judge, what would be mo&s;t in&s;tructive or agreeable to the Ta&s;te of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Audience; as will, in the Cour&s;e of this Undertaking, be fully &s;hewn.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Duke of <HI>YORK</HI>'s Company under Sir <HI>WILLIAM D'AVENANT, 1662;</HI> and the <HI>UNION</HI> betwixt the <HI>KING</HI>'s and <HI>DUKE</HI>'s Company, <HI>1682.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall begin the&s;e MEMOIRS of PLAYERS, with an Account of, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ROSCIUS, Mr. <HI>Thomas Betterton</HI>, whom we may &s;uppo&s;e in his own particular Per&s;on, on a Foot with that Illu&s;trious <HI>Ro|man</HI>; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> was excellent both in <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI>; whereas, by all we can di&s;cover, ROSCIUS was famous for <HI>Comedy</HI> only.</P>
<P>As to his De&s;cent, he was the Son of Mr. <HI>Thomas Betterton</HI>, Under-Cook to King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1&s;t, born in <HI>Tothill-&s;treet, We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI>, in the Year 1637. He had a very good Education, and when he was come to Years &s;ufficient, by his own Choice, his Fa|ther put him to Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI>, a Book&s;eller at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI>; Mr. <HI>Edward Kyna&s;ton</HI> was Fellow-'Prentice with him.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not here pa&s;s by Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Loyalty and Courage; who, tho' but a mere Stripling, went a Volunteer into the King's Service, as Mr. <HI>Hart</HI>, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mohun</HI>, had done before him. They were all Four engaged at the Battle of <HI>Edge-Hill</HI>, in <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Mohun</HI> &s;o re|markably
<PB N="6" REF="10">
&s;ignalized him&s;elf in this Engage|ment, that the Major, who commanded our young Cavaliers, being &s;hot, his Commi&s;&s;ion was given to Him.</P>
<P>After the Murder of the King, the&s;e Gentlemen all became Players; but what more immediately brought Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kyna&s;ton</HI> upon the Stage, was their Ma&s;|ter's having, formerly, been <HI>Wardrobe-Keeper</HI> to the King's Company of Comedians in <HI>Black-Fryars</HI>. And upon the March of General <HI>Monck</HI> with his Army, from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Lon|don</HI>, in the Year 1659, Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> obtained from the Powers then in being, a Licence to &s;et up a Company of Players in the <HI>Cock|pit</HI>, in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>, and &s;oon made it com|pleat; his two Apprentices, <HI>Betterton</HI> for Men's Parts, and <HI>Kyna&s;ton</HI> for Women's, be|ing the Head of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, tho' now but twenty-two Years of Age, acquired very great Applau&s;e by his Performances in <HI>The Loyal Subject. The Wild-Goo&s;e-Chace. The Spani&s;h Curate</HI>; and &s;everal other Plays of <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>. But, while our young Actor was thus ri&s;ing, under his Ma&s;ter <HI>Rhodes</HI>, Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI> procured a Patent of King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId, for erecting a Com|pany under the Title of <HI>The Duke of</HI> YORK'<HI>s Servants</HI>, and took Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, and all who acted under Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI>, into his Com|pany; and in the Year 1662, opened a THEA|TRE in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI>, with the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="11">
and <HI>&s;econd</HI> Parts of <HI>The Siege of</HI> RHODES, having new Scenes, and Decorations of the Stage, which were then fir&s;t u&s;ed in <HI>England</HI>.</P>
<P>Altho' this be affirmed by Some, Others have laid it to the Charge of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, as a Crime that he was the fir&s;t Innovator on our rude Stage; and that &s;uch Innovations were the De&s;truction of good Playing; but I think with very little Shew of Rea&s;on, and very little Knowledge of the Stages of <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>, where, I am apt to believe, was, in their flouri&s;hing Times, as great Actors, as ever played here, before Curtains. For how that which helps the Repre&s;entation, by a&s;|&s;i&s;ting the plea&s;ing Delu&s;ion of the Mind in regard of the Place, &s;hould &s;poil the Acting I cannot imagine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenian</HI> Stage was &s;o much adorned, that the very Ornaments or Decorations co&s;t the State more Money, than their Wars a|gain&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI>; tho' their Dramatic Poets were much inferior to the <HI>Greeks</HI>, (if we may gue&s;s at tho&s;e, who are peri&s;hed, by tho&s;e who remain) were yet not behind them, in the Magnificence of the Theatre to heighten the Plea&s;ure of the Re|pre&s;entation. If this was Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Thought, it was very ju&s;t; &s;ince the Audi|ence mu&s;t be often puzzled to find the Place and Situation of the Scene, which gives great Light to the Play, and helps to deceive us agreeably, while they &s;aw nothing before them but &s;ome <HI>Lin&s;ey-Wol&s;ey</HI> Curtains, or at be&s;t &s;ome
<PB N="8" REF="12">
Piece of old Tape&s;try filled with aukward Fi|gures, &s;uch as were di&s;agreeable to the Audience. This therefore I mu&s;t urge as his Prai&s;e, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> endeavoured to compleat that Repre|&s;entation which was before but imperfect.</P>
<P>At what time his Grace the Right Ho|nourable <HI>George Villiers</HI> Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI> began to write his REHEARSAL, we can|not exactly learn; but thus much may be certainly gathered from the Plays &s;atirized in it, that it was before the End of the Year 1663, and it is demon&s;trable that it was fi|ni&s;hed before the End of 1664, becau&s;e it had been &s;everal times Rehear&s;ed, the Players were perfect in their Parts, and all things were in readine&s;s for its Acting before the great Plague in 1665, which prevented its being played. What was then intended be|ing very different from what now appears. In <HI>That</HI> the Poet was called BILBOA, by which Name Sir <HI>Robert Howard</HI> was the Per&s;on pointed at. During this Interval, many Plays were brought upon the Stage written in He|roic Rhime; and on the Death of Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI> in 1668, whom Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;uc|ceeded as Poet-Laureat, it became &s;till in greater Vogue: This moved the Duke to change the Name of the Hero from <HI>Bilboa</HI> to BAYS, directly levelling his Bolt at Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>. It was brought upon the Stage in 1671, acted with univer&s;al Applau&s;e, and is the ju&s;te&s;t and true&s;t Satire upon a vitiated and Dramatic Ta&s;te, the World ever &s;aw; as it
<PB N="9" REF="13" MS="Y">
will be an everla&s;ting Proof of the Author's Wit and Judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, now making, among the <HI>Men</HI>, the foremo&s;t Figure in Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI>'s Company, he ca&s;t his Eyes on Mrs. <HI>Saunder&s;on</HI>, who was no le&s;s eminent among the <HI>Women</HI>, and married her. She was bred in the Hou&s;e of the Patentee, im|proved her&s;elf daily in her Profe&s;&s;ion, and having, by Nature, all the Accompli&s;hments required to make a perfect Actre&s;s, &s;he add|ed to them the di&s;tingui&s;hing Characteri&s;tick of a virtuous Life.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the Indu&s;try of the Patentee and Managers, it &s;eems the KING's <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> then carried the Vogue of the Town, and the <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI> Theatre be|ing not &s;o commodious, the Players and other Adventurers built a much more magni|ficent one in <HI>Dor&s;et-Gardens, Fleet-&s;treet</HI>, and adorned it with all the Machines and De|corations the Skill of tho&s;e Times could af|ford. This likewi&s;e proving le&s;s effectual than they hoped, other Arts were employed, and the Political Maxim of DIVIDE &amp; IM|PERA, (<HI>Divide</HI> and <HI>Govern</HI>) being put in prac|tice, the Feuds and Animo&s;ities of the KING's <HI>Company</HI> were &s;o well improved, as to pro|duce an Union betwixt the two Patents. To bring this De&s;ign about, the following Agreement was executed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P><HI>ELizabeth Barry</HI> was the Daughter of <HI>Robert Barry</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Barri&s;ter at Law; a Gentleman of an ancient Family, and good E&s;tate.</P>
<P>At the Beginning of the Civil Wars, when King <HI>Charles</HI> invited all his Loyal Sub|jects to take up Arms in his Defence, Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> rai&s;ed a Regiment for his Maje&s;ty's Service, compo&s;ed of his Neighbours and Tenants, equipping and maintaining them a con&s;iderable Time at his own Expence. This,
<PB N="14" REF="18">
as it ever after, made him known by the Title of Colonel <HI>Barry</HI>, it al&s;o &s;o far incum|bered his E&s;tate, as to oblige his Children, when grown up, to make their own For|tunes in the World.</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>D'Avenant</HI>, who had been &s;e|veral Years a Widow, and a particular Friend of Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI>, having the greate&s;t Friend&s;hip for Col. <HI>Barry</HI>, took his Daughter, when young, and gave her a good Education. Lady <HI>D'Avenant</HI> made her not only her Companion, but carried her wherever &s;he vi&s;ited. Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> by frequently conver|&s;ing with Ladies of the fir&s;t Rank and be&s;t Sen&s;e, became &s;oon Mi&s;tre&s;s of that Behaviour which &s;ets off the well-bred Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>What fir&s;t recommended Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> to the Stage, was her Voice; her good Air, tho' no Beauty, made Sir <HI>William</HI> take her; but as &s;he had a very bad Ear, they found it &s;o diffi|cult to teach her, that they thought it would be impo&s;&s;ible to make her fit for the meane&s;t Part. Three times &s;he was rejected; and Three times, by the Intere&s;t of her Lady, they were prevailed on again to try her, but with &s;o little Succe&s;s, that &s;everal Per&s;ons of Wit and Quality being at the Play, and ob&s;erving how ill &s;he performed, po&s;itively gave their Opinion &s;he never would be capable of any Part of Acting. But the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>, to &s;hew them he had a Judgment &s;uperiour, entered into a Wager, that by proper In&s;truc|tions, in le&s;s than &s;ix Months, he would en|gage
<PB N="15" REF="19">
&s;he &s;hould be the fine&s;t Player on the Stage. He was oppo&s;ed by them all, and tho' they knew him to be a Per&s;on of excellent Sen&s;e, yet they thought, on this Subject, he had &s;tarted beyond the Bounds of his Judg|ment; and &s;o many poignant Things were &s;aid to him on this Occa&s;ion, that they piqued him into a Re&s;olution of taking &s;uch Pains with Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, as to convince them he was not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>From the Moment he had this Di&s;|pute, he became intimately acquainted with her, but to the World he kept it private, e&s;pecially from tho&s;e he had argued with about her. He &s;oon, by talking with her, found her Mi&s;tre&s;s of exqui&s;ite Charms; and it was thought that he never loved any Per&s;on &s;o &s;incerely as he did Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>. Whoever has a mind to &s;ee him in the Form of a Lover, may find him &s;hine in the Letters annexed to his Poems (bound up with the Tragedy of <HI>Valentinian</HI>) Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> being the Per&s;on to whom tho&s;e Letters were Addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Parts Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> cho&s;e to teach Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, were the <HI>Little Gip&s;y</HI>, in the Co|medy of the <HI>Rover</HI>, by Mrs. <HI>Behn:</HI> and <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>, the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Queen, in the Tragedy of <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI>, by the E. of <HI>Orrery:</HI> which (be&s;ides the private In&s;tructions he gave her) he made her Rehear&s;e near 30 times on the Stage, and about 12 in the Dre&s;s &s;he was to Act it in.

into her Power. Once at the acting the la&s;t Scene of this Play Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> wounded Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> (who fir&s;t played the Part of <HI>Statira</HI>) the Occa&s;ion of which I &s;hall here recite.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> was likewi&s;e a very con&s;i|derable Actre&s;s; &s;he was low of Stature, had very agreeable Features, a good Com|plexion, but a Childi&s;h Look. Her Voice was weak, tho' very mellow; &s;he generally acted the <HI>young Innocent Lady</HI> whom all the Heroes are mad in Love with; &s;he was a Favourite of the Town; and, be&s;ides what &s;he &s;aved by Playing, the Genero&s;ity of &s;ome happy Lovers enabled her to quit the Stage before &s;he grew old.</P>
<P>It happened the&s;e Two Per&s;ons before they appeared to the Audience, unfortunately had &s;ome Di&s;pute about a <HI>Veil</HI> which Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> by the Partiality of the Property-Man ob|tained; this offending the haughty <HI>Roxana</HI>, they had warm Di&s;putes behind the Scenes, which &s;pirited the Rivals with &s;uch a natu|ral Re&s;entment to each other, they were &s;o violent in performing their Parts, and acted with &s;uch Vivacity, that <HI>Statira</HI> on hear|ing the King was nigh, <HI>begs the Gods to help her for that Moment</HI>; on which <HI>Roxana</HI> ha&s;tening the de&s;igned Blow, &s;truck with &s;uch Force, that tho' the Point of the Dagger was blunted, it made way through Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI>'s Stayes, and entered about a Quarter of an Inch in the Fle&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="26">This Accident made a great Bu&s;tle in the Hou&s;e, and alarmed the Town; many differ|ent Stories were told; &s;ome affirmed, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> was jealous of Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> and Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>, which made them &s;uppo&s;e &s;he did it with De&s;ign to de&s;troy her; but by all that could be di&s;covered on the &s;tricte&s;t Exa|mination of both Parties, it was only the <HI>Veil</HI> the&s;e two Ladies contended for, and Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> being warmed with Anger, in her Part, &s;he &s;truck the Dagger with le&s;s Caution, than at other times.</P>
<P>Tho' I have mentioned &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of this Play in which Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> &s;hined, I cannot conclude without taking notice that tho' before our Eyes we had ju&s;t &s;een <HI>Rox|ana</HI> with &s;uch Malice murder an innocent Per&s;on, becau&s;e better beloved than her&s;elf; yet, after <HI>Statira</HI> is dead, and <HI>Roxana</HI> is following <HI>Alexander</HI> on her Knees, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> made this Complaint in &s;o Pathetic a Manner, as drew Tears from the greate&s;t Part of the Audience,

<P>Here end the <HI>Memoirs</HI> communicated to us concerning Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>. But to the &s;ame Hand we are obliged for the following Account of that celebrated Actre&s;s, Mrs. MARSHALL.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>D'Avenant</HI>'s Company falling under Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Direction, as to the Women, he employed him&s;elf in vi&s;iting, and over|looking their Actions as a Guardian, or Fa|ther, and &s;everal Ladies &s;o far bu&s;ied them|&s;elves as often to enter into Quarrels with Nephews, Sons and Husbands, about attempt|ing to corrupt them. The private Behaviour of the&s;e young Women were frequently talk|ed of by the Ladies, extolling their virtuous Re&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e dangerous Seducers, Man, to the Clouds; and comparing fallen Nymphs, with the Fiends &s;inking to the Shades below.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Betterton</HI>, encouraged by the Pub|lic, joined with her own good Inclinations, trod the Stage without the lea&s;t Re|proach; but the fir&s;t Thing that gave a Damp to the&s;e Endeavours, and cau&s;ed her to find the guarding the&s;e Ladies Virtues a Task more laborious, and difficult, than any <HI>Hercules</HI> had impo&s;ed on him by his Step-Dame, was what happened to the famous Mrs. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI>, more known by the Name of <HI>Roxalana</HI> from her Acting that Part. This Lady po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="28">
a Mind which &s;hone with a haughty and &s;evere Virtue according to the Haughtine&s;s of that Age. She was attacked by, and had with&s;tood the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AUBREY DE VERE.</NOTE> in every Form an artful Gallant could put on. Grown mad with Love, and her Repul&s;es, he forms a Plot to get her by Force; intending to &s;eize her as &s;he went from the Hou&s;e after &s;he had been acting this Part; which being made known to her, by &s;ome real Friend, &s;he obtained a Party of the King's Guards to protect her. When her Chair appeared, the Nobleman began his A&s;&s;ault, but was valiantly repul&s;ed, and &s;he was &s;afely conducted Home.</P>
<P>This Adventure was the whole Talk of the Court and Town; the Ladies applauded her Re&s;olution &s;ecretly, not a little plea&s;ed to &s;ee their Sex's re&s;olute Behaviour in <HI>Roxalana</HI>. Many Parties were formed both <HI>for</HI> and <HI>again&s;t</HI> her. The Fanatics cried out, &s;aying, it was a Shame they &s;hould bring up Girls in the School of <HI>Venus</HI>, teaching them &s;uch Airs and Tricks to tempt Mankind. The Gentry liked the Diver&s;ion, alledging, the greater the Temp|tation, the greater the Glory to re&s;i&s;t, &s;ay|ing that Ladies were bred up in virtuous Sentiments, their Minds improved by high Ideas, and encouraged by the Patronage of the Good and Great.</P>
<P>However, in this Affair, the King him&s;elf having the Story repre&s;ented to him in the blacke&s;t Light, interpo&s;ed; and his Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="25" REF="29">
with a Freedom natural to one of the be&s;t tem|pered Princes, told the Earl, he thought the Vice (though perhaps he gave too much Countenance to it by his own Irregularity) bad enough with the Con&s;ent of the <HI>Fair</HI>, but where Force or Violence was u&s;ed, it was &s;o heinous, he would not, though a Soveraign, indulge the Thought of &s;uch an Action, much more permit it to be done by a Subject.</P>
<P>This Reproof cau&s;ed the Earl to an&s;wer with &s;ome Re&s;erve, he &s;aid he would think no more of her; but &s;oon after he renewed his A&s;&s;ault, telling her it was impo&s;&s;ible to live without her. That, her exalted Virtue had in&s;pired him with other Sentiments, propo|&s;ing to Marry her in private. This Bait <HI>Roxalana</HI> greedily &s;wallowed, her Vanity inclining her to believe the Earl &s;incere. In &s;hort, the Earl comes, brings his Coachman dre&s;&s;ed like a Mini&s;ter, Marries her, and took her down to one of his Country-Seats, where &s;oon growing weary of her, he pulled off the Mask, and, with Scorn, bid her return to the Stage. Upon this, &s;he threw her&s;elf at the King's Feet, who coun|tenanced her &s;o far, that he made the Earl allow her 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; and, as long as her Son lived would not &s;uffer him to Marry any other Lady; but, on the Child's Death, the Concern for &s;o ancient a Family's becoming extinct (the Earl being the la&s;t of it) his Maje&s;ty through great Interce&s;&s;ion was pre|vailed on, to permit of the Earl's Re-Marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30">WE are, in this Place, obliged, in Ju&s;tice to her Merit, to introduce, a Lady now living, Mrs. <HI>Anne Bracegirdle</HI>. She was the Daughter of <HI>Ju&s;tinian Bracegirdle</HI> of <HI>Northampton&s;hire</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> where &s;he was born.</P>
<P>It is not any Matter of our Enquiry by what Means a Gentlewoman of &s;o good an Extraction came upon the Stage, &s;ince the be&s;t Families have been liable to the greate&s;t Mi&s;|fortunes, among&s;t which was that of her Fa|ther, in being bound, and &s;uffering for Others. But it may be &s;ome kind of Alleviation to &s;ay, that in the Scene, wherein Providence had con|&s;igned her Fate, &s;he had the good Fortune to be well placed, when an Infant, under the Care of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and his Wife, who&s;e Ten|derne&s;s &s;he always acknowledges to have been Paternal; Nature formed her for the Stage, and it was to the Admiration of all Specta|tors that &s;he performed the Page in The <HI>Or|phan</HI>, at the Duke's Theatre in <HI>Dor&s;et-Gar|den</HI>, before &s;he was &s;ix Years old.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t leave her for the pre&s;ent, and return to Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>. For, with him, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the Di&s;regard for the <HI>Tragic</HI> Poem, is at all times chiefly to be at|tributed to a Defect in the <HI>Action</HI> when re|pre&s;ented on the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="31">Nor is there any greater Proof of the Vir|tue or Corruption of the People, than their Plea&s;ures. Thus in the Time of the Vigour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue, <HI>Tragedy</HI> was very much e&s;teemed, its Dignity kept up, and the Decorum of the Stage &s;o very nicely ob&s;er|ved, that a <HI>Player's &s;tanding out of his Or|der, or &s;peaking a fal&s;e Quantity, was &s;uf|ficient for him to be hi&s;&s;ed off the Stage</HI>.

<P>And when they gave us the mo&s;t noble Examples of Virtue in their real Life, they were mo&s;t plea&s;ed with the Repre&s;entation of noble Examples on the Stage; for People are delighted with what bears the greate&s;t Like|ne&s;s to the Turn and Temperament of their own Minds. Thus when the <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue decayed, or indeed was lo&s;t with their Li|berty, and they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and &s;pread their Dominions more by the Merit of their An|ce&s;tors, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Name made terri|ble by them, than by their own Bravery, then Effeminacy and Folly &s;pread thro' the People, which immediately appeared in their Sports or Spectacles; and <HI>Tragedy</HI> was &s;lighted.</P>

of the People; who care only to laugh, or to &s;ee things extravagant and mon&s;trous.</P>
<P>I rather at pre&s;ent attribute the Decay of <HI>Tragedy</HI> to our want of <HI>Tragedians</HI>, and in|deed <HI>Tragic Poets</HI>, than to the Corruption of the People; which, tho' great enough, yet is not &s;o de&s;olate, as what we have mentioned in the <HI>Roman</HI> State.</P>
<P>I have often heard Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> &s;ay, that when he fir&s;t Played under Sir <HI>Wil|liam D'Avenant</HI>, the Company was much better regulated, and they were obliged to make their Study their Bu&s;ine&s;s, which our young Actors do not think it their Duty now to do; for they &s;carce ever mind a Word of their Parts but only at <HI>Rehear&s;als</HI>, and come thither too often &s;carce recovered from their la&s;t Night's Debauch; when the Mind is not very capable of meditating &s;o calmly and judiciou&s;ly on what they have to &s;tudy, as to enter thoroughly into the Nature of the Part, or to con&s;ider the Variation of the Voice, Looks and Ge&s;tures which &s;hould give them their true Beauty, many of them thinking that making a Noi&s;e renders them agreeable to the Audience, becau&s;e a few of the Upper Gallary clap the loud Efforts of their Lungs, in which their Under&s;tanding has no Share. They think it a &s;uperfluous Trouble to &s;tudy real Excellence, which might rob them of what they fancy more, Midnight, or indeed whole Nights Debauches, and a lazy Remi&s;s|ne&s;s in their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33">Another Ob&s;tacle to the Improvement of our young Players, is, that when they have not been admitted above a Month or two into the Company, though their Education and former Bu&s;ine&s;s were ever &s;o Foreign to <HI>Acting</HI>, they vainly imagine them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of an <HI>Art</HI>, which perfectly to attain, re|quires a &s;tudious Application of a Man's whole Life. They take it therefore ami&s;s to have the Poet give them any In&s;truction; and tho' they hardly know any thing of the Art of Poetry, will pa&s;s their Cen&s;ure, and neglect or mind a Part as <HI>they</HI> think the <HI>Au|thor</HI> and his Part de&s;erves. Tho' in this they are led by Fancy as blind as Ignorance can make it; and &s;o wandering without any cer|tain Rule of Judgment, generally favour the bad, and &s;light the good. Whereas, &s;aid he, it has always been Mine and Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>'s Prac|tice to con&s;ult even the mo&s;t indifferent Poet in any Part we have thought fit to accept of; and I may &s;ay it of Her, &s;he has often &s;o ex|erted her&s;elf in an indifferent Part, that her Acting has given Succe&s;s in &s;uch Plays, as to read, would turn a Man's Stomach; and tho' I could never pretend to do &s;o much Service that way, as She has done, yet I have never been wanting in my Endeavours. But while young Actors will think them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters before they under&s;tand any one Point of their Art, and not give them|&s;elves Lei&s;ure and Time to &s;tudy the <HI>Graces of</HI> ACTION <HI>and</HI> UTTERANCE, it is impo&s;&s;ible

that the Stage &s;hould flouri&s;h and advance in Perfection.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e Sentiments, but &s;ome are apt to be|lieve many of Them proceed from want of Judgment in the Managers, in admitting People unqualified by Nature, and not pro|viding &s;uch Per&s;ons to direct them, as un|der&s;tand the Art they &s;hould be improved in. All other Arts People are taught by Ma&s;ters skilful in them, but here Ignorance teaches it&s;elf, or rather confirms it &s;elf into the Confidence of Knowledge, by going on without any Rebuke.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, and the in&s;tilling of them, into All under his Care, were owe|ing that ju&s;t <HI>Action</HI> which appeared on the <HI>Stage</HI> under Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Conduct.</P>

<Q>&startq;Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>) always plea&s;es, and, what he delivers, every one takes up|on Con&s;ent; their Eyes are prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and charmed by his Action, before aught of the Poet's can approach their Ears; and to the mo&s;t wretched of Characters he gives a Lu&s;tre and Brilliant, which dazzles the Sight, that the Deformities in the Poe|&endq;try cannot be perceived.</Q>

<P>JOHN BOMAN, Son of <HI>John Boman</HI>, of <HI>King-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>, was born at <HI>Pillerton</HI> in <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> (in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, Chamber and Bed wherein his <HI>Mother</HI> was Born on the 27th of <HI>December</HI>, St. <HI>John</HI>'s Day, 1664.)</P>
<P>He was brought into the Duke's Theatre to Sing at Seven Years old.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Boman</HI> married <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, Daugh|ter of Sir <HI>Francis Wat&s;on</HI>, Bart. She was born in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Martin</HI> in the <HI>Fields</HI> 1677, and was a very pretty Player both in her Per&s;on and Performances; particularly remarkable, for Acting the Part of <HI>Eurydice</HI> in OEDIPUS.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="36">That famous Comedian Mr. <HI>James Nokes</HI> was a Toyman in <HI>Cornhill</HI>. From his La|bours on the Stage, he acquired and left to a Nephew at his Death, an E&s;tate of 400 <HI>l. per Annum</HI>, at <HI>Totteridge</HI> near <HI>Barnet</HI>.</P>
<P>Upon his commencing Player, King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second fir&s;t di&s;covered his Excellencies as he was Acting the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> in <HI>Shake|&s;peare</HI>'s <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> wrote <HI>Gomez</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fryar in Compliment to Mr. <HI>Nokes</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> was a Barri&s;ter at Law of the Society of <HI>Grays Inn</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> was bred a Seal-Cutter, and he made Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Williams</HI> a Player.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Anthony Lee</HI> was of a good Family, and born in <HI>Northampton&s;hire</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>William Mountfort</HI> was a Gentleman de&s;cended of a very good Family. The fir&s;t particular Notice taken of him on the Stage was in Acting the Part of <HI>Tall-Boy</HI>; &s;oon after which his Salary was advanced; and he became more famous in Playing Sir <HI>Courtly Nice</HI>.</P>
<P>He was taken off the Stage, and made one of the Gentlemen to Lord Chancellor <HI>Jefferies</HI>,
<Q>&startq;who at an Entertainment of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen in the Year 1685, called for Mr. <HI>Mountfort</HI> to di|vert the Company (as his Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to term it) he being an excellent Mimic, my Lord made him Plead before him in a Feigned Cau&s;e, in which he Aped all the great Lawyers of the Age in
<PB N="33" REF="37">
their Tone of Voice, and in their Action and Ge&s;ture of Body, to the very great Ridicule not only of the Lawyers, but of the Law it&s;elf; which to me (&s;ays the <HI>Hi|&s;torian</HI>) did not &s;eem altogether prudent in a Man of his lofty Station in the Law: Diverting it certainly was; but prudent, in the Lord High Chancellor, I &s;hall never &endq;think it.</Q>

<P>We mu&s;t leave Mr. <HI>Mountfort</HI>, for &s;ome time, performing his Duty in the Service of Lord Chancellor <HI>Jefferies</HI>, and proceed to others his Cotemporaries, among whom was Mr. <HI>George Powel</HI>, an excellent Tragedian.

<P>But this Chapter &s;hall be concluded with a few Remarks, made by Mr <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>, rela|ting to a very peculiar Player. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See GUARDIAN, Numb. 82.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Mr. <HI>William Peer</HI> was an Actor at the Re&s;toration, and took his Theatrical De|gree with <HI>Betterton, Kyna&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Harris</HI>. Tho' his Station was humble, he performed it well; and the common Compari&s;on with the Stage and Human Life which has been &s;o often made, may well be brought out upon this Occa&s;ion. <HI>It is no matter</HI>, &s;ay the Morali&s;ts, <HI>whether you act a</HI> Prince,
<PB N="34" REF="38">
<HI>or a</HI> Beggar, <HI>the Bu&s;ine&s;s is to do your Part &endq;well</HI>.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Peer</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf parti|cularly in <HI>Two</HI> Characters, which no <HI>Man</HI> ever could <HI>touch</HI> but him&s;elf; <HI>One</HI> of them was the <HI>Speaker</HI> of the <HI>Prologue</HI> to the <HI>Play</HI>, which is contrived in the Tragedy of HAM|LET, to awake the Con&s;ciences of the Guilty Princes. Mr. <HI>Peer</HI> &s;poke this <HI>Prologue</HI> with &s;uch an <HI>Air</HI> as repre&s;ented him an Actor, and with &s;uch an <HI>inferior manner</HI> as only <HI>act|ing</HI> an <HI>Actor</HI>, as made the <HI>Others</HI> on the <HI>Stage</HI> appear <HI>real</HI> great <HI>Per&s;ons</HI>, and not <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI>. This was a <HI>Nicety</HI> in <HI>Act|ing</HI> that none but the mo&s;t <HI>&s;ubtile Player</HI> could &s;o much as conceive. I remember his &s;peaking the&s;e Words, in which there is no great matter but in the <HI>right Adju&s;tment</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> of the <HI>Speaker</HI>, with univer&s;al Ap|plau&s;e.
<Q><L><HI>For</HI> Us, <HI>and for</HI> our Tragedy,</L>
<L>Here &s;tooping to <HI>your Clemency</HI>,</L>
<L>We beg <HI>your hearing</HI> patiently.</L></Q>
<HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ays very archly upon the pronoun|cing of it, <HI>Is this a Prologue or a Poe&s;ie of a Ring?</HI> However the &s;peaking of it got Mr. <HI>Peer</HI> more Reputation, than tho&s;e who &s;peak the Length of a Puritan's Sermon eve|ry Night will ever attain to. Be&s;ides <HI>this</HI>, he got great Fame on <HI>another</HI> little Occa&s;ion. He played the Apothecary in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI>; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to recite more
<PB N="35" REF="39">
out of the Play than <HI>Peer</HI> &s;poke, to have a right Conception of what he did in it. <HI>Ro|meo</HI>, weary of Life, recollects Means to be rid of it after this manner:
<Q><L>I do remember an Apothecary</L>
<L>That dwelt about this rendezvous of Death;</L>
<L>Meagre and very rueful were his Looks,</L>
<L>Sharp Mi&s;ery had worn him to the Bones.</L></Q>
When this Spectre of Poverty appeared, <HI>Romeo</HI> addre&s;&s;es him thus;
<Q><L>I &s;ee Thou art very poor.</L>
<L>Thou may'&s;t do any thing, here's fifty Drachmas,</L>
<L>Get me a Draught of what will &s;oone&s;t free</L>
<L>A Wretch from all his Cares.</L></Q>
When the Apothecary objects that it is un|lawful, <HI>Romeo</HI> urges;
<Q><L>Art Thou &s;o ba&s;e and full of Wretchedne&s;s,</L>
<L>Yet fear'&s;t to Die? Famine is in thy Cheeks,</L>
<L>Need and Oppre&s;&s;ion &s;tareth in thy Eyes,</L>
<L>Contempt and Beggary hang on thy Back;</L>
<L>The World is not thy Friend, nor the World's Laws.</L>
<L>Then be not Poor, but break it, and take This.</L></Q>
Without the&s;e Quotations the Reader could not have a ju&s;t Idea of the Vi&s;age and Man|ner which <HI>Peer</HI> a&s;&s;umed, when in the mo&s;t lamentable Tone imaginable; and delivering the Poi&s;on, like a Man reduced to the drink|ing
<PB N="36" REF="40">
it him&s;elf, if he did not vend it, &s;ays to <HI>Romeo</HI>,
<Q><L>My Poverty, but not my Will, con&s;ents.</L>
<L>Take this and drink it off, the Work is done.</L></Q></P>
<P>It was an odd Excellence, and a very par|ticular Circum&s;tance this of <HI>Peer</HI>'s, that his whole Action of Life depended upon &s;peak|ing <HI>five</HI> Lines better than any Man el&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;hall farther proceed to &s;hew, from Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Papers, what the <HI>Duty</HI> of a <HI>Player</HI> is.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the <HI>DUTY</HI> of a <HI>PLAYER</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>FROM his very <HI>Name</HI> we may derive his <HI>Duty</HI>, he is called an <HI>Actor</HI>, and his Excellence con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Acting</HI> and <HI>Speaking:</HI> The <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Pantomimes</HI> did all by Ge|&s;ture, and the Action of Hands, Legs and Feet, without making u&s;e of the Tongue in uttering any Sentiments or Sounds; &s;o that they were &s;omething like our <HI>Dumb-Shows</HI>, with this Difference, one <HI>Pantomime</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;everal Per&s;ons, and that to the Tunes of Mu&s;ical In&s;truments. The <HI>Dumb-Shows</HI> made u&s;e of &s;everal Per&s;ons to expre&s;s the
<PB N="37" REF="41">
De&s;ign of the Play as a &s;ilent Action. The Nature of this is be&s;t &s;een in <HI>Hamlet</HI> before the Entrance of his <HI>Players</HI>.</P>
<Q>[Enter a <HI>King</HI> and a <HI>Queen</HI> very lovingly, the <HI>Queen</HI> embracing him; &s;he kneels, and makes Shew of Prote&s;tation unto him; he takes her up, and reclines his Head on her Neck. Lays him down on a Bed of Flow|ers; &s;he &s;eeing him a&s;leep, leaves him. Anon comes in a Fellow, takes off his Crown, ki&s;&s;es it, and pours Poi&s;on into the King's Ear, and <HI>Exit</HI>. The <HI>Queen</HI> returns, finds the <HI>King</HI> dead, and makes pa&s;&s;ionate Action. The <HI>Poi&s;oner,</HI> with two or three <HI>Mutes,</HI> comes in again, &s;eems to lament with her; the dead Body is carried away. The <HI>Poi&s;oner</HI> courts the Queen with Gifts; &s;he &s;eems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his Love.]</Q>
<P>I only repeat this to &s;hew the manner of the old Time, and what they meant by Dumb-Shows, which <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> him&s;elf condemns in this very Play, when <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ays to the <HI>Players</HI>,
<Q>&startq;O! it offends me to the Soul to &s;ee a robu&s;tuous Perriwig-pated Fellow tear a Pa&s;&s;ion to Tatters, to very Rags, to &s;plit the Ears of the <HI>Ground|lings</HI>, who (for the mo&s;t part) are capable of nothing but <HI>inexplicable Dumb-Shows</HI> &endq;and Noi&s;e&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="42">But the <HI>Pantomimes</HI> or <HI>Roman Dancers</HI> expre&s;&s;ed all this in one Per&s;on, as we have it in Mr. <HI>Mayne</HI>'s LUCIAN; where <HI>Demetrius</HI> the <HI>Cynic</HI> Philo&s;opher railing again&s;t <HI>Dancing</HI>, is invited by one of them in the Time of <HI>Nero</HI>, to &s;ee him perform without either <HI>Pipe</HI> or <HI>Flute</HI>, and did &s;o;
<Q>&startq;for having impo&s;ed <HI>Silence</HI> on the In&s;truments, he by him&s;elf danced the Adultery of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI>, the <HI>Sun</HI> betraying them, and <HI>Vulcan</HI> plot|ing, and catching them in a Wire-Net; then every God, who was &s;everally Specta|tor; then <HI>Venus</HI> blu&s;hing, and <HI>Mars</HI> be|&s;eeching; in a Word, he Acted the whole Fable &s;o well, that <HI>Demetrius</HI> much plea&s;ed with the Spectacle, as the greate&s;t Prai&s;e that could be be&s;towed upon him, cryed out in a loud Voice, I <HI>hear</HI> my Friend, what you <HI>act</HI>; nor do I only <HI>&s;ee</HI> them, but methinks you <HI>&s;peak</HI> with your &endq;Hands.</Q></P>
<P>This In&s;tance not only &s;hews the Differ|ence between the&s;e <HI>Pantomimes</HI> from our old Dumb-Shows; but the Power of <HI>Action</HI>, which a <HI>Player</HI> ought to &s;tudy with his ut|mo&s;t Application. The Orator at the Bar, and in the Pulpit, ought to under&s;tand the Art of Speaking perfectly well; but <HI>Action</HI> can never be in its Perfection but on the Stage, and in our Time the Pulpit and the Bar have left off even that graceful Action, which was nece&s;&s;ary to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e Places, and gave a ju&s;t Weight and Grace to
<PB N="39" REF="43">
the Words they uttered. And I wonder that our Clergy do not a little more con&s;ider this Point, and reflect, that they &s;peak to the People as much as the Orators of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>; and what Influence Action had on them, will be evident from &s;ome In&s;tances we &s;hall give in their proper Places.</P>
<P>ACTION indeed has a natural Excellence in it, &s;uperior to all other Qualities; <HI>Action</HI> is <HI>Motion</HI>, and <HI>Motion</HI> is the Support of Na|ture, which without it would again &s;ink into the &s;luggi&s;h Ma&s;s of Chaos. <HI>Motion</HI> in the various and regular Dances of the Planets &s;urprizes and delights: <HI>Life</HI> is <HI>Motion</HI>, and when that cea&s;es, the human Body &s;o beau|tiful, nay, &s;o divine when enlivened by <HI>Mo|tion</HI>, becomes a dead and putrid Coar&s;e, from which all turn their Eyes. The Eye is caught by any thing in <HI>Motion</HI>, but pa&s;&s;es over the &s;luggi&s;h and motionle&s;s things as not the plea&s;ing Object of its View.</P>
<P>This natural Power of <HI>Motion</HI> or <HI>Action</HI> is the Rea&s;on, that the Attention of the Au|dience is fixed by any irregular or even fanta|&s;tic Action, on the Stage, of the mo&s;t indif|ferent Player; and &s;upine and drow&s;y; when the be&s;t Actor &s;peaks without the Addition of <HI>Action</HI>.</P>
<P>It was the Skill the ancient Players of <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> had in this, which made them not only &s;o much admired by the Great Men of tho&s;e Times and Places, but rai&s;ed them to the Reputation of being Ma|&s;ters
<PB N="40" REF="44">
of Two of the greate&s;t Orators that <HI>Athens</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> ever &s;aw; and who, had it not been for the In&s;tructions of the Actors <HI>Satyrus, Ro&s;cius</HI> and <HI>Ae&s;opus</HI>, had never been able to convey their admirable Parts to the World.</P>
<P><HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> being, after many &s;ucce&s;sful Attempts, one Time exploded the A&s;&s;embly, went Home with his Head muffled up in his Cloak, very much affected with the Di&s;|grace; in this Condition <HI>Satyrus</HI> the Actor followed him, being his intimate Acquaint|ance, and fell into Di&s;cour&s;e with him. <HI>De|mo&s;thenes</HI> having bemoaned him&s;elf to him, told his Misfortune, that having been the mo&s;t indu&s;trious of the Pleaders, and having &s;pent almo&s;t the whole Strength and Vigour of his Body in that Employment, yet could he not render him&s;elf acceptable to the Peo|ple; that Drunkards, Tarpaulins, Sots and illiterate Fellows, found &s;o favourable a Hear|ing, as to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Pulpit, while he him|&s;elf was de&s;pi&s;ed. What you &s;ay (replied <HI>Satyrus</HI>) is very true, but I will &s;oon re|move the Cau&s;e of all this, if you will re|peat &s;ome Ver&s;es to me out of <HI>Sophocles</HI>, or <HI>Euripides</HI>. When <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> had pronoun|ced after his Way, <HI>Satyrus</HI> pre&s;ently repeat|ing the &s;ame Ver&s;es with their proper Tone, Mien and Ge&s;ture, gave &s;uch a Turn to them, that <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> him&s;elf perceived they had quite another Appearance. By which being convinced how much Grace and
<PB N="41" REF="45">
Ornament accrues to Speech by a proper and due Action, he began to think it of little Con&s;equence for a Man to exerci&s;e him&s;elf in declaiming, if he neglected the ju&s;t Pronunci|ation or Decency of Speaking. Upon this he built him&s;elf a Place under Ground (which remained in the Time of <HI>Plutarch</HI>) whither he retired every Day to form his Action, and exerci&s;e his Voice. To &s;hew what Pains this Great Man took, as an Example to our young Actors, who do not think them&s;elves obliged to take any at all, I &s;hall proceed with <HI>Plutarch</HI>. In his Hou&s;e he had a great Looking-Gla&s;s, before which he would &s;tand and repeat his <HI>Orations</HI>, by that Means ob|&s;erving how far his <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> were graceful or unbecoming.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>, when a Client came to him on an A&s;&s;ault and Battery, he at large gave him an Account of what Blows he had received from his Adver&s;ary, but in &s;o calm and unconcerned a Manner, that <HI>De|mo&s;thenes</HI> &s;aid, Surely, my good Friend, thou ha&s;t not &s;uffered any one thing of what thou make&s;t thy Complaint: Upon which his Client warmed, cryed aloud&mdash;<HI>How</HI>, Demo&s;|thenes? <HI>Have I &s;uffered nothing?</HI> Ay marry, replies he, now I hear the Voice of a Man who has been injured and beaten. Of &s;o great Con&s;equence did he think the Tone and Ac|tion of the Speaker towards the gaining Be|lief.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="46">This was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>, as <HI>Plu|tarch</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, and that of <HI>Cicero</HI> was not much different&mdash;At fir&s;t (&s;ays <HI>Plutarch</HI>) he was, as well as <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>, very defective in Action, and therefore he diligently applied him&s;elf to <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> the <HI>Comedian</HI> &s;ometimes, and &s;ometimes to <HI>Ae&s;opus</HI> the <HI>Tragedian</HI>. And &s;uch afterwards was the <HI>Action</HI> of <HI>Cicero</HI>, that it did not a little contribute to make his Eloquence per&s;ua&s;ive; deriding the Rhetori|cians of his Time, for delivering their <HI>Ora|tions</HI> with &s;o much Noi&s;e and Bawling, &s;ay|ing, that it was their want of Ability to &s;peak, which made them have Recour&s;e to bellowing.</P>
<P>The &s;ame might be &s;aid to many of our bawling Actors, of which Number <HI>Ae&s;opus</HI> was not, yet &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with his Part, that he took his acting to be &s;o real, and not a Repre&s;entation, that whil&s;t he was on the Stage repre&s;enting <HI>Atreus</HI> deliberating on the Revenge of <HI>Thye&s;tes</HI>, he was &s;o tran&s;ported beyond him&s;elf, that he &s;mote one of the Servants ha&s;tily cro&s;&s;ing the Stage, and laid him dead on the Place.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>, in his <HI>Advancement of Learn|ing</HI>, gives us a Hi&s;tory from the <HI>Annals</HI> of <HI>Tacitus</HI>, of one <HI>Vibulenus</HI>, formerly an Actor on the Stage, but at that time a common Soldier in the <HI>Pannonian</HI> Garri&s;ons; which is a wonderful In&s;tance of the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Action</HI>, and what Force it adds to the Words. The Account is as follows,</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47"><HI>Vibulenus</HI>, on the Death of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae|&s;ar</HI>, had rai&s;ed a Mutiny, &s;o that <HI>Blae&s;us</HI> the Lieutenant committed &s;ome of the Muti|neers to Pri&s;on; but the Soldiers violently broke open the Pri&s;on-Gates, and &s;et their Comrades at Liberty; and this <HI>Vibulenus</HI>, in a Tribunitial Speech to the Soldiers, begins in this manner&mdash;
<Q>&startq;You have given Life and Light to the&s;e poor innocent Wretches&mdash; but who re&s;tores my Brother to me, or Life to my Brother? who was &s;ent hither with a Me&s;&s;age from the Legions of <HI>Ger|many</HI> to treat of the common Cau&s;e; and this very la&s;t Night has he murdered him by &s;ome of his Gladiators, &s;ome of his Bravoes, whom he keeps about him to be the Murderers of the Soldiers. An&s;wer, <HI>Blae&s;us</HI>, where ha&s;t thou thrown his Body; the mo&s;t mortal Enemies deny not Burial to the dead Enemy: When to his Corps I have performed my la&s;t Duties in Ki&s;&s;es, and flowing Tears, command me to be &s;lain at his Side, &s;o that the&s;e our Fellow-Sol|&endq;diers may have leave to bury us.</Q></P>
<P>He put the Army into &s;uch a Ferment and Fury by this Speech, that if it had not immediately been made appear, there was no &s;uch Matter, and that he never had any Brother, the Soldiers would hardly have &s;pared the Lieutenant's Life; for he acted as if it had been &s;ome Interlude on the Stage.</P>
<P>There is not &s;o great a Pathos in the Words uttered by the Soldier, as to &s;tir the
<PB N="44" REF="48">
Army into &s;o very great a Ferment, they mu&s;t therefore receive almo&s;t their whole Force from a mo&s;t moving and pathetic Ac|tion, in which his Eyes, Hands and Voice joined in a mo&s;t lively Expre&s;&s;ion of his Mi|&s;ery and of his Lo&s;s. It is true, that when an Army is tumultuous in it&s;elf, it is no dif|ficult matter to run them into Madne&s;s; but then it mu&s;t be done by &s;ome, who ei|ther by their former Intere&s;t there, had pur|cha&s;ed an Opinion among them, or &s;ome one who by the Artfulne&s;s of his Addre&s;s &s;hould touch their Souls, and &s;o engage them to what he plea&s;es. The latter I take to be our Ca&s;e in <HI>Vibulenus</HI>, who by the Advantage of his Skill in Action recommended him&s;elf and his &s;uppo&s;ititious Cau&s;e &s;o effectually to them, as to make the General run a great hazard of his Life for an imaginary Murder.</P>
<P>This has made &s;ome of the old Orators give the &s;ole Power in <HI>Speech</HI> to <HI>Action</HI>, as I have read in &s;ome of tho&s;e learned Men who have treated of this Subject in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI>. And I am per&s;uaded that the Clergy would move their Hearers far more, if they added but graceful <HI>Action</HI> to loud <HI>Speaking</HI>. This often &s;ets off indifferent Mat|ter, and makes a Man of little Skill in any other Part of Oratory, pa&s;s for the mo&s;t eloquent; this, I have read, was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Trachallus</HI>, who tho' none of the be&s;t Ora|tors of his Time for the Compo&s;ition and Writing-part, yet excelled all the Pleaders of
<PB N="45" REF="49">
that Age, his Appearance and Delivery was &s;o plau&s;ible and plea&s;ing. The Stateline&s;s of his Per&s;on and Port, the Sparkling of his Eyes, the Maje&s;ty of his Looks, the Beauty of his Mien and his <HI>Voice</HI>, added to the&s;e Qualities, which not only for Gra|vity and Compo&s;edne&s;s came up to that of a <HI>Tragedian</HI>, but even excelled any Actors, that ever yet trod the Stage, as <HI>Quintilian</HI> a&s;&s;ures us. <HI>Phili&s;tus</HI>, on the other hand, for want of the&s;e Advantages of Utterance, lo&s;t all the Beauty and Force of his Pleadings, tho for Language and the Art of Compo&s;ition he excelled all the <HI>Greeks</HI> of his Time.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Advantage had <HI>Pericles</HI> and <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI>, with this Difference, <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI> a&s;cribed all the Succe&s;s of his Pleadings to the Merit of the Writing, and convinced the World of his Error by publi&s;hing his Ora|tions; <HI>Pericles</HI>, tho' it is &s;aid he had the Godde&s;s <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion</HI> on his Lips, and that he thundered and lightened in an A&s;&s;embly, and made all <HI>Greece</HI> tremble when he &s;poke, yet would never publi&s;h any of his Orations, be|cau&s;e their Excellency lay in the ACTION.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid here of <HI>Action</HI> in ge|neral, and the particular Examples I have given, is I believe &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy any one that is &s;tudious of Excellence on the Stage, that it ought to be his chief Aim and Application. But next to this is the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Speaking</HI>, in which al&s;o a Player ought to be perfectly skilled; for, as an eminent Writer

<Q>&startq;The Operation of Speech is &s;trong, not only for the Rea&s;on or Wit therein contained, but by its Sound. For in all good Speech there is a &s;ort of Mu|&s;ic, with re&s;pect to its Mea&s;ure, Time and Tune. Every well-mea&s;ured Sentence is proportional Three Ways, in all its Parts to the Sentences, and to what it is intended to expre&s;s, and all Words that have Time allowed to their Syllables, as is &s;uitable to the Letters whereof they con&s;i&s;t, and to the Order in which they &s;tand in a Sen|tence. Nor are Words without their Tune or Notes even in common Talk, which together compo&s;e that Tune, which is proper to every Sentence, and may be pricked down as well as any mu&s;ical Tune: only in the Tunes of Speech the Notes have much le&s;s Variety, and have all a &s;hort Time. With re&s;pect al&s;o to Time and Mea&s;ure, the Poetic is le&s;s various, and therefore le&s;s powerful, than that of Oratory; the former being like that of a &s;hort Country Song repeated to the End of the Poem, but that of <HI>Oratory</HI> is va|ried all along, like the Divi&s;ions which a &endq;skilful Mu&s;ician runs upon a Lute.</Q></P>
<P>He proceeds to our former Con&s;ideration, &s;aying,&mdash;
<Q>&startq;The Behaviour and Ge&s;ture is al&s;o of Force; as in Oratory &s;o in Con|ver&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of almo&s;t as many Moti|ons, as there are moveable Parts of the Body, all made with a certain agreeable
<PB N="47" REF="51">
Mea&s;ure between one another, and at the &s;ame time an&s;werable to that of Speech, which when ea&s;y and unaffected is becom|&endq;ing.</Q></P>
<P>A Ma&s;tery in the&s;e Two Parts is what compleats an Actor: And I hope the Rules I &s;hall give for both will be of U&s;e to &s;uch as have truly a Genius for this <HI>Art</HI>; the Rules of which like tho&s;e of <HI>Poetry</HI>, are only for tho&s;e who have a Genius, and are not per|fectly to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e who have not.</P>
<P>To begin therefore with <HI>Action</HI>, the Player is to con&s;ider, that it is not every rude and unde&s;igning <HI>Action</HI> which is his Bu&s;ine&s;s, for that is what the Ignorant as well as the Skil|ful may have, nor can indeed want: But the Action of a Player is, what is agreeable to Per&s;onation, or the Subject he repre&s;ents. Now what he repre&s;ents is Man in his various Characters, Manner and Pa&s;&s;ions, and to the&s;e Heads he mu&s;t adju&s;t every Action; he mu&s;t perfectly expre&s;s the Quality and Man|ners of the Man who&s;e Per&s;on he a&s;&s;umes, that is, he mu&s;t know how his Manners are compounded, and from thence know the &s;e|veral Features, as I may call them, of his Pa&s;&s;ions. A Patriot, a Prince, a Beggar, a Clown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t each have their Propriety, and Di&s;tinction in Action as well as Words and Language. An <HI>Actor</HI> therefore mu&s;t vary with his Argument, that is, carry the Per&s;on in all his Manners and Qualities with
<PB N="48" REF="52">
him in every Action and Pa&s;&s;ion; he mu&s;t transform him&s;elf into every Per&s;on he repre|&s;ents, &s;ince he is to act all &s;orts of Actions and Pa&s;&s;ions. Sometimes he is to be a Lover, and know not only all the &s;oft and tender Addre&s;&s;es of one, but what are proper to the Character of Him who is in Love, whether he be a Prince or a Pea&s;ant, a hot or fiery Man, or of more moderate and flegmatic Con&s;ti|tution, and even the Degrees of the Pa&s;&s;ion he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with. Sometimes he is to re|pre&s;ent a choleric, hot and jealous Man; then he mu&s;t be thoroughly acquainted with all the Motions and Sentiments productive of tho&s;e Motions of the Feet, Hands and Looks of &s;uch a Per&s;on in &s;uch Circum&s;tances. Some|times he is a Per&s;on all dejected and bending under the Extremities of Grief and Sorrow; which changes the whole Form and Appear|ance of him in the Repre&s;entation, as it does really in Nature. Sometimes he is di&s;tract|ed, and here Nature will teach him, that his Action has always &s;omething wild and irre|gular, tho' even that regularly; that his Eyes, his Looks or Countenance, Motions of Body, Hands and Feet, be all of a Piece, and that he never falls into the indifferent State of Calmne&s;s and Unconcern. As he now repre&s;ents <HI>Achilles</HI>, then <HI>Aeneas</HI>, another time <HI>Hamlet</HI>, then <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and <HI>Oedipus</HI>, he ought to know perfectly well the Characters of all the&s;e Heroes, the very &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions differing in different Heroes as
<PB N="49" REF="53">
their Characters differ: The Courage of <HI>Aeneas</HI>, for Example, of it&s;elf was &s;edate and temperate, and always attended with good Nature; that of <HI>Turnus</HI> joined with Fury, yet accompanied with Genero&s;ity and Greatne&s;s of Mind. The Valour of <HI>Mezen|tius</HI> was &s;avage and cruel; he has no Fury but Fiercene&s;s, which is not a Pa&s;&s;ion but Habit, and nothing but the Effect of Fury cooled into a very keen Hatred, and an in|veterate Malice. <HI>Turnus</HI> &s;eems to fight to appea&s;e his Anger, <HI>Mezentius</HI> to &s;atisfy his Revenge, his Malice and barbarous Thir&s;t of Blood. <HI>Turnus</HI> goes to the Field with Grief, which always attends Anger, where|as <HI>Mezentius</HI> de&s;troys with a barbarous Joy; he is &s;o far from Fury, that he is hard to be provoked to common Anger; who calmly killing <HI>Ondes</HI>, grows but half angry at his Threats;
<Q>At whom <HI>Mezentius</HI> &s;mil'd with mingled Ire.</Q>
Thus, it is plain, he has not the Fury of <HI>Turnus</HI>, but a Barbarity peculiar to him&s;elf, and a &s;avage Fiercene&s;s, according to his Character, <HI>Virg.</HI> B. 10.</P>
<P>To know the&s;e different Characters of e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Heroes, the Actor need only be ac|quainted with the Poets, who write of them; if the Poet who introduces them in his Play have not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed them. But to know the different Compo&s;itions of the
<PB N="50" REF="54">
Manners, and the Pa&s;&s;ions &s;pringing from tho&s;e Manners, he ought to have an In&s;ight into Moral Philo&s;ophy, for they produce va|rious Appearances in the Looks and Actions, according to their various Mixtures. For that the very &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion has various Appear|ances, is plain from the Hi&s;tory-Painters who have followed: Nature, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jordan</HI> of <HI>Antwerp</HI>, in a Piece of our Savi|our's being taken from the Cro&s;s, which is now in his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Hands, the Pa&s;&s;ion of Grief is expre&s;&s;ed with a won|derful Variety; the Grief of the Virgin-Mo|ther is in all the Extremity of Agony, that is con&s;i&s;tent with Life; nay, indeed, that &s;carce leaves any Signs of remaining Life in her; that of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> is an extreme Grief, but mingled with Love and Tender|ne&s;s, which &s;he always expre&s;&s;ed, after her Conver&s;ion, for our ble&s;&s;ed Lord; then the Grief of St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangeli&s;t is &s;trong but manly, and mixed with the Tenderne&s;s of perfect Friend&s;hip; and, that of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI>, &s;uitable to his Years and Love for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>, more &s;olemn, more contracted in him|&s;elf, yet forcing an Appearance in his Looks.</P>
<P><HI>Coypel</HI>'s Sacrifice of <HI>Jeptha</HI>'s Daughter has very luckily expre&s;&s;ed a great Variety of this &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hi&s;tory-Painters</HI> indeed have ob&s;erved a Decorum in their Pieces, which wants to be introduced on our <HI>Stage</HI>; for they never place

any Per&s;on on the <HI>Cloth</HI>, who has not a Con|cern in the <HI>Action</HI>.</P>
<P>All the Slaves in <HI>Le Brun</HI>'s Tent of <HI>Darius</HI> participate of the grand Concern of <HI>Si&s;igambis, Statyra</HI>, &amp;c. This would render the Repre|&s;entation extremely &s;olemn and beautiful; but on the <HI>Stage</HI>, not only the Supernumera|ries, as they call them, or Attendants, &s;eem regardle&s;s of the great Concern of the <HI>Scene</HI>, and, even the <HI>Actors</HI> them&s;elves, who are on the <HI>Stage</HI>, and not in the very principal Parts, will be whi&s;pering to one another, or bowing to their Friends in the Pit, or gazing about. But if they made Playing their Study, (or had indeed a Genius to the Art) as it is their Bu&s;ine&s;s, they would not only, not be guilty of the&s;e Ab&s;urdities, but would, like <HI>Le Brun</HI>, ob&s;erve Nature wherever they found her offer any thing that could contribute to their Perfection. For this great Ma&s;ter was often &s;een to ob&s;erve a Quarrel in the Street betwixt various People, and therein not only to regard the &s;everal Degrees of the Pa&s;&s;ions of Anger ri&s;ing in the Fray, and their different Rece&s;s, but the di&s;tinct Expre&s;&s;ions of it in every Face that was concerned.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Stage</HI>, indeed at the be&s;t, is but a very cold <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI>, when &s;upported by loud <HI>Prompting</HI>, to the great Di&s;gu&s;t of the Au|dience, and &s;poiling the Decorum of what is Repre&s;ented; for an imperfect Actor af|fronts the Audience, and betrays his own De|merits.

They forget <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Advice to the Players. &mdash; <HI>Let tho&s;e who play your Clowns &s;peak no more than is &s;et down for them; for there be of them that will of them&s;elves laugh, to &s;et on &s;ome Quantity of barren Spectators to laugh too; tho' in the mean time &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Que&s;tion of the Play be then to be con&s;idered.

<P>AFTER the painful Warfare of a pub|lic Life, Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI> hoped the Re|mainder of it might have been pa&s;&s;ed in Si|lence. But &s;ince &s;he finds otherwi&s;e, and
<PB N="60" REF="64">
that your <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI> is intended to do Honour both to the Dead and the Living, the following faithful Account of her is tran&s;|mitted, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Mary Porter</HI>, was the Daughter of Mr. <HI>Samuel Porter</HI>, but as &s;he lo&s;t her Father too early to have any Knowledge of him, and being &s;eparated from her Mother when very young, &s;he did not care to revive &s;o ten|der an Incident, as giving her the greate&s;t Concern, being able to give no farther Ac|count of a Parent than barely his Name.</P>
<P>Her Mother marrying Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> private|ly, without her Parents Con&s;ent, her Father, Mr. <HI>Nicholas Mercator</HI>, being a <HI>German</HI>, and a Man of Letters, went, &s;oon after his Daughter's Marriage, di&s;gu&s;ted into <HI>France</HI>, and died there. He took with him all his Family except his New-married Daughter and his elde&s;t Son, Mr. <HI>David Mercator</HI>, who was then one of the Clerks belonging to the Office of Ordnance in the Tower of <HI>Lon|don</HI>. This Gentleman, after the Death of his Father, took care of his Niece without corre&s;ponding with his Si&s;ter. For which Rea&s;on Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Mother removed her from her Uncle, and put her into <HI>Bartholo|mew</HI> Fair; where, the very fir&s;t time of her Appearance, in Acting the Part of the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI> took &s;o great a liking to her, that, upon their Repre&s;entation of her Performance, Mr. <HI>Bet|terton</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="65">
admitted her into the Theatre, and they treated her with the mo&s;t tender Indul|gence.</P>
<P>Our young <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> was boarded with Mrs. <HI>Smith</HI>, Si&s;ter to the Trea&s;urer of the Playhou&s;e, who&s;e Care of her was Ma|ternal, from the particular Recommendation of her Friends, more e&s;pecially of Mrs. <HI>Brace|girdle</HI>.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="62" REF="66">We find by this Letter, that the Pub|lic &s;tand indebted to Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, for this excellent Actre&s;s; the only living Ornament of the Tragic Scene.</P>
<P>It was the Opinion of a very good Judge of Dramatical Performers, that another Gen|tlewoman, now living, was one of the great|e&s;t, and mo&s;t promi&s;ing <HI>Genij</HI> of her Time. This was Mrs. <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI>, who was taken off the Stage, for her exemplary and prudent Conduct, by <HI>Martin Folkes</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Gentle|man of a very con&s;iderable E&s;tate, who mar|ried her; and &s;uch has been her Behaviour to him, that there is not a more happy Couple. Mrs. <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI>, di&s;cour&s;ing with a Friend, who was giving her &s;ome In&s;truc|tions in her Profe&s;&s;ion, told him, that &s;he did all in her Power to ob&s;erve a Rule laid down by Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>,
<Q>&startq;to make her&s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of her Part, and leave the <HI>Figure</HI> &endq;and <HI>Action</HI> to <HI>Nature</HI>.</Q>
Now tho' a great Genius may do this, yet <HI>Art</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;ulted in the Study of the larger Share of the Profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Oratory</HI>; for, as Mr. <HI>Bet|terton</HI> mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly remarks, &s;o great a Man as <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> perfected him&s;elf by con|&s;ulting the Gracefulne&s;s of the Figure in his Gla&s;s: For to expre&s;s Nature ju&s;tly, one mu&s;t be Ma&s;ter of Nature in all its Appear|ances, which can only be drawn from Ob&s;er|vation, which will tell us, that the Pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="63" REF="67">
and Habits of the Mind di&s;cover them&s;elves in our Looks, Actions and Ge&s;tures.</P>
<P>Thus we find a <HI>rolling Eye</HI>, which is quick and incon&s;tant in its Motion, argues a quick but light Wit; a hot and choleric Complex|ion, with an incon&s;tant and impatient Mind; and in a Woman it gives a &s;trong Proof of Wantonne&s;s and Immode&s;ty. Heavy dull Eyes, a dull Mind, and a Difficulty of Con|ception. For this Rea&s;on we ob&s;erve, that all or mo&s;t People in Years, &s;ick Men, and Per&s;ons of a flegmatic Con&s;titution are &s;low in turning of their Eyes.</P>
<P>That extreme Propen&s;ion to <HI>Winking</HI> in &s;ome Eyes, proceed from a Soul very &s;ubject to Fear, arguing a Weakne&s;s of Spirit, and a feeble Di&s;po&s;ition of the Eye-lids.</P>
<P>A bold <HI>&s;taring</HI> Eye, which fixes on a Man, proceeds either from a blocki&s;h Stupidity, as in Ru&s;ticks; Impudence, as in malicious Per|&s;ons; Prudence, as in tho&s;e in Authority, or Incontinence, as in lewd Women.</P>
<P>Eyes <HI>inflamed</HI> and <HI>fiery</HI>, are the genuine Effect of Choler and Anger; Eyes quiet and calm with a &s;ecret kind of Grace and Plea|&s;antne&s;s are the Offspring of Love and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Voice</HI>, when loud, di&s;covers Wrath and Indignation of Mind, and a &s;mall trembling Voice proceeds from Fear.</P>
<P>In like manner, to u&s;e no <HI>Actions</HI> or <HI>Ge|&s;tures</HI> in Di&s;cour&s;e, is a &s;ign of a heavy and &s;low Di&s;po&s;ition, as too much Ge&s;ticulation
<PB N="64" REF="68">
proceeds from Lightne&s;s; and a Mean be|twixt both is the Effect of Wi&s;dom and Gra|vity; and if it be not too quick, it denotes Magnanimity. Some are perpetually fidling about their Cloaths, &s;o that they are &s;carce dre&s;&s;ed till they go to Bed, which is an Ar|gument of a childi&s;h and empty Mind.</P>
<P>Some ca&s;t their <HI>Heads</HI> from one &s;ide to the other wantonly and lightly, the true Effect of Folly and Incon&s;tancy. Others think it e&s;&s;ential to <HI>Prayer</HI>, to writh and wre&s;t their Necks about, which is a Proof of Hypocri&s;y, Super&s;tition or Fooli&s;hne&s;s. Some are wholly taken up in viewing them&s;elves, the Proportion of their Limbs, Features of their Faces, and Gracefulne&s;s of Mien; which proceeds from Pride, and a vain Com|plai&s;ance in them&s;elves; of this Number are Coquets.</P>
<P>In this manner we might examine all the natural Actions, which are to be found in Men of different Tempers. Yet not to di&s;mi&s;s the Point without a fuller Reflection, we &s;hall here give the Signification of the Na|tural Ge&s;tures from a <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> of a learn|ed Je&s;uit who wrote on this Subject.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Emotion</HI> of the <HI>Mind, &s;ays he</HI>, has from Nature its peculiar and proper Countenance, Sound, and Ge&s;ture; and the whole Body of Man, all his Looks, and every Tone of his Voice, like Strings on an In&s;trument, receive their Sounds from the various Impul&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="69">The <HI>Demi&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>hanging down of the Head</HI> is the Con&s;equence of <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Sor|row</HI>. And this therefore is a Po&s;ture and Manner ob&s;erved in the Deprecations of the Divine Anger, and on &s;uch Occa&s;ions ought to be ob&s;erved in the Imitations of tho&s;e things.</P>
<P>A <HI>lifting</HI> or <HI>to&s;&s;ing up of the Head</HI> is the Ge&s;ture of <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Arrogance</HI>. Carrying the <HI>Head aloft</HI> is the &s;ign of Joy, Victory and Triumph.</P>
<P>A <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>bold Front</HI> or Forehead is looked on as a Mark of Ob&s;tinacy, Contu|macy, Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and Impudence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soul</HI> is the mo&s;t vi&s;ible in the <HI>Eyes</HI>, as being, according to &s;ome, the perfect Ima|ges of the Mind; and as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ays, they burn, yet di&s;&s;olve in Floods; they dart their Beams on Objects, and &s;eem not to &s;ee them; and when we ki&s;s the Eyes, we &s;eem to touch the very Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Eyes lifted on high</HI>, &s;hew Arrogance and Pride, but <HI>ca&s;t down</HI>, expre&s;s Humblene&s;s of Mind: Yet we lift up our Eyes when we addre&s;s our&s;elves in Prayer to God, and ask any thing of him.</P>
<Q><P>Lifting in vain his burning Eyes to Heaven.</P>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>Denial, Aver&s;ion, Nau&s;eating, Di&s;&s;imula|tion, and Neglect, are expre&s;&s;ed by a turn|ing away of the Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="70">A frequent <HI>Winking</HI>, or <HI>tremulous Motion</HI> of the <HI>Eyes</HI>, argues malicious Manners, and perver&s;e and noxious Thought and Inclina|tions.</P>
<P><HI>Eyes drowned in Tears</HI> di&s;cover the mo&s;t vehement and cruel Grief, which is not capa|ble of Ea&s;e even from Tears them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To <HI>rai&s;e our Eyes</HI> to any Thing or Per&s;on, is an Argument of our Attention to them with De&s;ire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hand</HI> put on the <HI>Mouth</HI> is a Token of Silence by Conviction, and is a Ceremony of the Heathen Adoration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Contraction</HI> of the <HI>Lips</HI>, and the <HI>&s;caunt Look</HI> of the <HI>Eyes</HI>, expre&s;&s;es the Ge|&s;ture of a deriding and malicious Per&s;on. Shewing the Teeth, and &s;traitening the Lips on them, &s;hews Indignation and Anger.</P>
<P><HI>Turning the whole Face to any thing</HI>, is the Ge&s;ture of Him, who attends and has a pe|culiar Regard to that one thing. To bend the Countenance downward argues Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s and Guilt; and, on the contrary, to lift up the Face is a Sign of a good Con&s;cience or Innocence, Hope and Confidence.</P>
<P>The Countenance, indeed, is changed into many Forms, and is commonly the mo&s;t cer|tain Index of the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind. When it is pale it betrays Grief, Sorrow and Fear: and Envy, when it is very &s;trong. A louring and dark Vi&s;age is the Index of Mi|&s;ery, Labour and vehement Agitations of the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="71">The <HI>Countenance</HI>, as <HI>Quintilian</HI> ob&s;erves, is of very great Power and Force in all that we do. In this we di&s;cover when we are &s;up|pliant, when menacing, when kind, when &s;orrowful, when merry; in this we are lifted up and ca&s;t down; on this Men depend, this they behold, and this they fir&s;t take a View of before we &s;peak; by this we love &s;ome, and hate others; and by this we under&s;tand a Multitude of things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arm extended and lifted up</HI>, &s;ignifies the Power of doing and accompli&s;hing &s;ome|thing; and is the Ge&s;ture of Authority, Vi|gour and Victory. On the contrary, the hold|ing your Arms clo&s;e is a Sign of Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, Mode&s;ty and Diffidence.</P>
<P>As the Hands are the mo&s;t habil Members of the Body, and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily turned to all Sides, &s;o are they the Indexes of many Habits.</P>
<P>As we have two Hands, the Right and the Left, we &s;ometimes make u&s;e of one, &s;ometimes of the other, and &s;ometimes of both, to expre&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ion and Habit. The chief Forms of which I &s;hall mention.</P>
<P><HI>Lifting of one Hand upright</HI>, or extending it, expre&s;&s;es Force, Vigour and Power. The Right Hand is al&s;o extended upwards as a Token of Swearing, or taking a &s;olemn Oath; and this Exten&s;ion of the Hand &s;ometimes &s;ignifies Pacification, and De&s;ire of Silence.</P>
<P><HI>Putting of the Hand to the Mouth</HI>, is the Habit of one that is &s;ilent, and acting Mo|de&s;ty;
<PB N="68" REF="72">
of Admiration and Con&s;ideration. The giving the Hand is a Ge&s;ture of &s;triking a Bargain, confirming an Alliance, or of deli|vering ones &s;elf into the Power of another. To take hold of the Hand of another ex|pre&s;&s;es Admonition, Exhortation and Encou|ragement. The reaching out an Hand to another implies Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The lifting up both Hands on high is the Habit of one who implores, and expre&s;&s;es his Mi|&s;ery. And the lifting up of both Hands &s;ome|times &s;ignifies Congratulation to Heaven for a Deliverance, as in <HI>Virgil</HI>;
<Q><L>His Hands, now free from Bands, he lifts on high,</L>
<L>In grateful Action to th' indulgent Gods.</L></Q></P>
<P>Holding the Hands in the Bo&s;om is the Habit of the Idle and Negligent. Clap|ping the Hands, among the <HI>Hebrews</HI>, &s;igni|fied deriding, in&s;ulting, and exploding; but among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI>, it was, on the contrary, the Expre&s;&s;ion of Applau&s;e. The Impo&s;ition of Hands &s;ignifies the im|parting a Power in con&s;ecrating of Victims.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is a difficult Matter, &s;ays <HI>Quintilian</HI>, to relate what a Number of Motions the Hands have, without which all Action would be maimed and lame, &s;ince the&s;e Motions are almo&s;t as various as the Words we &s;peak. For the other Parts may be &s;aid to help a Man when he &s;peaks, but the Hands (as I may &s;ay) &s;peak them&s;elves.
<PB N="69" REF="73">
Do we not by the Hands de&s;ire a thing? Do we not by the&s;e promi&s;e? call? di&s;|mi&s;s? threaten? act the Suppliant? ex|pre&s;s our Abomination or Abhorrence? our Fear? By the&s;e do we not ask Que|&s;tions? deny? &s;hew our Joy, Grief, Doubt, Confe&s;&s;ion, Penitence, Moderation, Plenty, Number and Time? Do not the &s;ame Hands provoke, forbid, make Supplication, approve, admire, and expre&s;s Shame? Do they not in &s;hewing of Places and Per&s;ons, &s;upply the Place of the Adverbs and Pro|nouns? In&s;omuch that in &s;o great a Variety or Diver&s;ity of the Tongues of all Nati|ons, this &s;eems to remain the univer&s;al &endq;Language common to all.</Q></P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that this Art were a little revived in our Age, when &s;uch u&s;eful Members, which of old contributed &s;o much to the Expre&s;&s;ion of Words, &s;hould now puzzle our Players what to do with them, when they &s;eldom or never add any Grace to the Action of the Body, and never almo&s;t any thing to the Explanation or fuller Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the Words and Pa&s;&s;ions. To pro|ceed a little farther.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Stamping of the Feet</HI>, among the <HI>Hebrews</HI> &s;ignified Deri&s;ion and Scoffing. Among the <HI>Greeks</HI>, &amp;c. Imperiou&s;ne&s;s. A con&s;tant and direct Foot, is the Index of a &s;teady, certain, con&s;tant and right Study and Aim of our De&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="74">On the contrary, <HI>Feet</HI>, full of Motion, are the Habit of the incon&s;tant and fluctua|ting in their Coun&s;els and Re&s;olves. And the <HI>Greeks</HI> thought this in Women a &s;ign of a flagitious Temper.</P>
<P>Thus have I recited the <HI>Je&s;uit's</HI> Ob&s;erva|tions on the Ge&s;tures and Po&s;itions of the &s;e|veral Parts and Members of the Body. And tho' &s;ome of them may &s;eem too particular, yet I am per&s;uaded, that a Per&s;on of true Judg|ment may find many Excellencies in them, which may afford him great Helps in the rendering his Ge&s;tures beautiful and expre&s;|&s;ive. There is no greater Proof of this, than the Example I have already urged of The <HI>Pantomime</HI> and <HI>Demetrius</HI> the <HI>Cynic</HI> Philo|&s;opher, who cried out to him, <HI>I hear, my Friend, what you act; nor do I only &s;ee them, but methinks you &s;peak with your</HI> HANDS. But this Speaking with the Hands, (as it is here called) I find contain a great deal of the Repre&s;enting of the Dancing Dumb-Shows of the <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Pantomimes</HI>. It may be perhaps objected, that the&s;e Motions of the Hands were &s;o well known to the Frequent|ers of the Theatres, that, like our talking on our Fingers with tho&s;e, who under&s;tand it, there would be no Difficulty in the Repre|&s;entation; but that if any Stranger or Fo|reigner &s;hould have been there, it would have been nothing but an unintelligible Ge&s;ticula|tion, and what <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> calls it, <HI>unexpli|cable dumb Shews</HI>; whereas if the&s;e Actions
<PB N="71" REF="75">
and Ge&s;tures were drawn from their Natural Significancy, according to tho&s;e Marks I have already given, or others referred to by my Quotation of <HI>Quintilian</HI>, they mu&s;t be intel|ligible to all Nations, on fir&s;t Sight to <HI>Bar|barians</HI>, who never &s;aw them before, as well as to <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>, who conver&s;ed with them every Day.</P>
<P>I allow the Objection, but &s;hall remove it by a farther Account of the very &s;ame <HI>Pan|tomime</HI>, who lived in the Time of <HI>Nero:</HI> The Story is this&mdash;
<Q>&startq;A <HI>Barbarian</HI> Prince who came from <HI>Pontus</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI>, on a Vi|&s;it to <HI>Nero</HI>, among other Entertainments &s;aw this <HI>Dancer</HI> per&s;onate &s;o lively, that tho he knew nothing of what was &s;ung, being half a <HI>Grecian</HI>, yet he under&s;tood all. Being therefore to return to his Coun|try after this Entertainment of <HI>Nero</HI>'s, and bid ask what he would and it &s;hould be granted, replied, give me the <HI>Dancer</HI>, and you will infinitely oblige me. <HI>Nero</HI> ask|ing him of what u&s;e he would be to him? My Neighbour <HI>Barbarians</HI> (&s;ays he) are of different Languages, nor is it ea&s;y for me to find Interpreters for them; this Fel|low, therefore, as often as I have need, &endq;&s;hall expound to me by his Ge&s;tures.</Q>
So clear and intelligible were his Actions and Ge&s;tures, and &s;o derived from the Nature of the thing repre&s;ented; which is a Proof, that there are certain Natural Significations of the Motions of the Hands, and other Members
<PB N="72" REF="76">
of the Body, which are obvious to the Un|der&s;tanding of the &s;en&s;ible Men of all Na|tions. If tho&s;e which I have given you from my <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> be not, yet I am very &s;ure, that many of them are explained by him, which will be plain to a &s;erious Ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>Ge&s;ture has therefore this Advantage above mere Speaking, that by this we are under|&s;tood by tho&s;e of our own Language, but by Action and Ge&s;ture (I mean ju&s;t and regular Action) we make our Thoughts and Pa&s;&s;ions intelligible to all Nations and Tongues. It is, as I have ob&s;erved from <HI>Quintilian</HI>, the com|mon Speech of all Mankind, which &s;trikes our Under&s;tanding by our Eyes, as effectual|ly as Speaking does by the Ears; nay, per|haps, makes the more effectual Impre&s;&s;ion, that Sen&s;e being the mo&s;t vivacious and touching, according to <HI>Horace</HI> in his <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI>;
<Q><L>But what we Hear moves le&s;s, than what we See;</L>
<L>Spectators only have their Eyes to Tru&s;t.</L>
<BIBL>ROSCOM.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I think we have already a&s;&s;igned tolerable Rea&s;ons why <HI>Movement</HI> and <HI>Action</HI> &s;hould teach us &s;o &s;en&s;ibly; nay, the very Repre|&s;entation of them in <HI>Painting</HI> often &s;trikes the Pa&s;&s;ions, and makes Impre&s;&s;ions on our Minds more &s;trong and vivid, than all the Force of Words. The chief Work is cer|tainly done by Speech in mo&s;t other ways
<PB N="73" REF="77">
of Public Di&s;cour&s;e, either at the <HI>Bar</HI>, or in the <HI>Pulpit</HI>; where the Weight of the Rea&s;on and the Proof are fir&s;t and mo&s;t to be con&s;idered: But on the Stage, where the Pa&s;|&s;ions are chiefly in View, the be&s;t <HI>Speaking</HI> de&s;titute of <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> (the Life of all Speaking) proves but a heavy, dull, and dead Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>This, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, will likewi&s;e reach all things delivered in Public, &s;ince we find <HI>Pliny the Younger</HI> talking of People in his Days reciting of their Speeches, or Poems, either by reading them them&s;elves, or by ha|ving them read by others, tell us, that this reading them was a very great Di&s;advantage to the Excellence of their Performance either way, le&s;&s;ening both their <HI>Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Cha|racter</HI>, &s;ince the principal Helps of <HI>Pronun|ciation</HI>, the <HI>Eyes</HI> and the <HI>Hands</HI>, could not perform their Office, being otherwi&s;e em|ployed to read, and not adorn the Utterance with their proper Motions; in&s;omuch that it was no manner of wonder, that the Attention of the Audience grew languid on &s;o unactive an Entertainment. On the contrary, when any Di&s;cour&s;e receives Force and Life, not only from the Propriety and Graces of &s;peak|ing agreeable to the Subject, but from a pro|per <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> for it, it is truly moving, penetrating, tran&s;porting; it has a Soul, it has Life, it has Vigour and Ener|gy not to be re&s;i&s;ted. For then the <HI>Player</HI>, the <HI>Preacher</HI> or <HI>Pleader</HI>, holds his Audience
<PB N="74" REF="78">
by the Eyes, as well as Ears, and engro&s;&s;es their Attention by a double Force. This &s;eems to be well repre&s;ented in &s;ome Words of <HI>Cicero</HI> to <HI>Caecilius</HI> a young Orator, in his fir&s;t Cau&s;e, who would needs undertake the <HI>Action</HI> again&s;t <HI>Verres</HI>, in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Hor|ten&s;ius</HI>. After he has &s;hown his Incapacity in many Points to accu&s;e <HI>Verres</HI>, both in Ability, and in not being free from a Su&s;pi|cion of a Share in the Guilt, he comes at la&s;t to the Power and Art of his Adver&s;ary. <HI>Hor|ten&s;ius</HI>, &s;ays he, <HI>reflect, con&s;ider, again and again, what you are going to do! for there &s;eems to me to be &s;ome Danger not only of his oppre&s;&s;ing you with his Words, but even of his confounding and dazling the Eyes of your Under&s;tanding with his</HI> GESTURE, <HI>and the Motion of his Body, and &s;o entirely drive you from your De&s;ign, and from all your Thoughts</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI>, in his Books of <HI>Oratory</HI>, tells us, that <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI> pleading again&s;t <HI>Brutus</HI>, deliver|ed his Words with &s;uch an Accent and &s;uch a Ge&s;ture, that he perfectly con&s;ounded the latter, and put him out of Countenance, fix|ing his Eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly on him, and addre&s;|&s;ing all his Action to him, as if he would devour him with a <HI>Look</HI> and a <HI>Word</HI>.</P>
<P>But to make the&s;e Motions of the Face and Hands ea&s;ily under&s;tood, that is, u&s;eful in moving the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Auditors, or rather Spectators, they mu&s;t be properly &s;uited to the thing you &s;peak of, your
<PB N="75" REF="79">
Thoughts and De&s;ign; and always re&s;embling the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> you would expre&s;s or excite. Thus you mu&s;t never &s;peak of mournful Things with a gay and brisk Look, nor <HI>affirm</HI> any thing with the Action of <HI>Denial</HI>; for that would make what you &s;ay of no manner of Authority or Credit; you would gain neither Belief nor Admiration. You mu&s;t al&s;o have a peculiar Care of avoiding all manner of <HI>Affectation</HI> in your <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI>, for that is mo&s;t commonly ridiculous and odious, unle&s;s where the Actor is to expre&s;s &s;ome Af|fectation in the Character he repre&s;ents, as in <HI>Melantha</HI> in <HI>Marriage Ala-mode</HI>, and <HI>Mil|limant</HI> in the <HI>Way of the World</HI>. But even then that very Affectation mu&s;t be unaffected, as tho&s;e two Parts were admirably performed by Mrs. <HI>Mountfort</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>.

<P>We mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that the Head mu&s;t not be kept always like that of a Sta|tue without Motion; nor mu&s;t it on the con|trary be moving perpetually, and always throwing it&s;elf about on every different Expre&s;&s;ion. It mu&s;t therefore &s;hun the&s;e ri|diculous Extreams, turn gently on the Neck, as often as Occa&s;ion requires a Motion, ac|cording to the Nature of the thing, turning now to one &s;ide, and then to another, and then return to &s;uch a decent Po&s;ition, as your Voice may be&s;t be heard by all or the gene|rality of the Audience. The Head ought always to be turned on the &s;ame Side, to which the <HI>Actions</HI> of the re&s;t of the Body are directed, except when they are employed to expre&s;s our Aver&s;ion to things, we refu&s;e; or on Things we dete&s;t and abhor: For the&s;e Things we reject with the <HI>Right Hand</HI>, at the &s;ame time turning the Head away to the <HI>Left</HI>.</P>

the Countenance. Some have been extremely &s;urprized at the Ancients U&s;e of tho&s;e Masks on the Stage, which they called the <HI>Per&s;onae</HI>; nor is it ea&s;y to imagine how they were made, not to de&s;troy that Grace and Beauty of Act|ing in the Management of the Lineaments of the Face, which by all that we have of that kind mu&s;t be entirely hid; and yet what <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI>, is a Proof, that the Players of <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> were ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of Speaking and Action. It is true, there is much in the <HI>Voice</HI> to expre&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ion artfully, yet certainly the &s;everal Figurations of the Countenance, as of the <HI>Eyes, Brow, Mouth</HI>, and the like, add the mo&s;t touching and the mo&s;t moving Beauties. But this Ob&s;ervation before men|tioned &s;ufficiently proves, that tho&s;e were entirely lo&s;t by the <HI>Per&s;onae</HI>; which is a Proof, that in whatever they excelled our Actors, we have the Advantage in the mak|ing the Repre&s;entation perfect, by enjoying the Benefit of expo&s;ing all the Motions of the Face.</P>
<P>The Character which <HI>Lucian</HI> gives of tho&s;e <HI>Per&s;onae</HI> makes them extremely ridiculous, and by his De&s;cription of the re&s;t of the Tra|gic Equipage, would make us very much doubt their Excellence in other Parts of Acting. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Mayne</HI>'s Tran&s;lat. of <HI>Lucian</HI>.</NOTE>
<Q>&startq;What a deformed and frightful Sight is it, to &s;ee a Man rai&s;ed to a prodigious Length, &s;talking on exalted Buskins, his Face di&s;|gui&s;ed
<PB N="86" REF="90">
with a grim Vizor, widely gaping, as if he meant to devour the Spectators; I forbear to &s;peak of his &s;tuffed Brea&s;ts and Fore-bellies, which make an adventitious and artificial Corpulency, le&s;t his unnatu|ral Length &s;hould carry a Di&s;proportion to &endq;his Slenderne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Surely &s;uch a Figure as <HI>Lucian</HI> gives the <HI>Tragedian</HI>, mu&s;t not only render him incapa|ble of giving the Body all its ju&s;t Motions and graceful Ge&s;tures, of which we are talk|ing, and which the great Writers celebrate &s;o much; but mu&s;t be ridiculous to a Farce. But tho' what <HI>Lucian</HI> repre&s;ents, may be looked upon as in the Time of the Corrup|tion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Stage, yet the <HI>Cothurni</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;onae</HI> were in u&s;e among the <HI>Greeks</HI>, and mu&s;t have been extremely preju|dicial to the Beauty of the Repre&s;entation. The Rea&s;on given for the fir&s;t was the com|mon Opinion, that the Heroes of former Times were larger and taller than our Cotem|poraries; and it is probable that the fir&s;t U&s;e of the Vizor, which &s;ucceeded the be&s;meer|ing the Face with Lees of Wine in the Time of <HI>The&s;pis</HI>, was chiefly to expre&s;s the Looks and Countenance of the &s;everal Heroes repre|&s;ented, according to their Statues and Por|traitures, which made the Players always new to the Audience; whereas we coming always on the Stage with the &s;ame Face, put a Force on the Imagination of the Audience to fancy us other than the &s;ame Per&s;ons. But
<PB N="87" REF="91">
there is a Method, which, if maturely &s;tu|died, would obtain this Variety of Counte|nance more artfully, and at the &s;ame time in|&s;pire the Actor better with the Nature and Genius of his Part. In a <HI>French</HI> Book writ|ten by one <HI>Gafferel</HI> a Monk, he tells us, that when he was at <HI>Rome</HI> he went to &s;ee <HI>Campa|nella</HI> in the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI>, and found him ma|king abundance of Faces; which he at fir&s;t imagined, proceeded from the Torments he had undergone; but he &s;oon undeceived him by enquiring what &s;ort of Countenance &s;uch a Cardinal had, to whom he had ju&s;t before &s;ent; for he was forming his Countenance, as much as he could, to what he knew of his, that he might know what his An&s;wer would be.</P>
<P>If therefore a Player was acquainted with the Character of his Hero, &s;o far as to have an Account of his Features and Looks, or of any one living of the &s;ame Character, he would not only vary his Face &s;o much by that means, as to appear quite another Face, by rai&s;ing, or falling, contracting, or ex|tending the Brows; giving a brisk or &s;ullen, &s;prightly or heavy Turn to his Eyes; &s;har|pening or &s;welling his No&s;trils, and the va|rious Po&s;itions of his Mouth, which by Prac|tice would grow familiar, and wonderfully improve the Art of Acting, and rai&s;e the no|ble Diver&s;ion to greater E&s;teem. The &s;tudy|ing Hi&s;tory-Painting would be very u&s;eful on this Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e the Knowledge of
<PB N="88" REF="92">
the Figure and Lineaments of the Per&s;ons re|pre&s;ented will teach the Actor to vary and change his Figure, which would make him not always the &s;ame in all Parts, but his very Countenance &s;o changed, that they would not only have other Thoughts them&s;elves, but rai&s;e others in the Audience. Some carry their Heads aloft and &s;tately, others pucker their Brows, look with a piercing Eye; as we have &s;aid; and the&s;e things thoroughly con&s;idered by the Player, would in every Part make him a new Man; and with more Beauty &s;upply the <HI>Per&s;onae</HI> of the Ancients, and rai&s;e our Stage to a greater Merit, than theirs could pretend to, which deprived the Audience of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t vivacious Part of the Repre&s;entation, in the Lo&s;s of the Motions of the Face; of which we ought to take a peculiar Care, &s;ince it is on that, which the Audience or Spectators ge|nerally fix their Eyes the whole Time of the Action.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e and frequent Practice ought to reform the lea&s;t Error in this Particular, be|cau&s;e in the Performance every one pre&s;ently di&s;covers it, tho' the Actor &s;ees it not him|&s;elf. The &s;ure&s;t Way of correcting this is either a Looking-Gla&s;s, or a judicious Friend, who can and will let you know what Coun|tenance is agreeable, and what the contrary. But this is a general Rule, without any Ex|ception, that you adju&s;t all the Lines and Motions of the Face to the Subject of your
<PB N="89" REF="93">
Di&s;cour&s;e, the Pa&s;&s;ion you feel within you, or &s;hould according to your Part feel, or would rai&s;e in tho&s;e who hear and &s;ee you. You mu&s;t likewi&s;e con&s;ider the Quality you repre|&s;ent, as well as the Quality of tho&s;e to whom you &s;peak; for even in great Degrees of the Pa&s;&s;ions the Difference and Di&s;tance of that has a greater or le&s;s Awe upon the very Ap|pearance of the Pa&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Countenance</HI> mu&s;t be brightened with a plea&s;ant Gayety on things that are agreeable, and that ac|cording to the Degrees of their being &s;o; and likewi&s;e in <HI>Joy</HI>, which mu&s;t &s;till be heighten|ed in the Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Love</HI>; tho' indeed the <HI>Countenance</HI> in the Expre&s;&s;ion of this Pa&s;&s;ion is extremely various, participating &s;ometimes of the Tran&s;ports of Joy, &s;ometimes of the Agonies of Grief; it is &s;ometimes mingled with the Heats of Anger, and &s;ometimes &s;miles with all the plea&s;ing Tranquility of an equal Joy. Sadne&s;s or Gravity mu&s;t pre|vail in the <HI>Countenance</HI>, when the Subject is grave, melancholy or &s;orrowful; and Grief is to be expre&s;&s;ed according to its various De|grees of Violence. <HI>Hate</HI> has its peculiar Ex|pre&s;&s;ion compo&s;ed of <HI>Grief, Envy</HI> and <HI>Anger</HI>, a Mixture of all which ought to appear in the Eye. When you bring or offer <HI>Com|fort</HI>, Mildne&s;s and Affability ought to be &s;een in your <HI>Countenance</HI>, as <HI>Severity</HI> &s;hould, when you cen&s;ure or reprehend.</P>

And to Mr. <HI>Harris</HI>, who played Prince <HI>Pro&s;pero</HI>, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> gave his Suit. And to Mr. <HI>Price</HI> who acted <HI>Lionel</HI> Duke of <HI>Parma</HI>, the Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> gave his Cloaths. Mrs. <HI>Daven|port</HI> an excellent Actre&s;s played <HI>Evandra</HI>.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time afterwards Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Harris</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Price</HI>, all appeared again, in the Revival of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>'s <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI>, when a very merry Incident happened. There being a Fight in this Play between the Hou&s;e of <HI>Capulet</HI> and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI>. Mrs. <HI>Holden</HI>, a good Actre&s;s, who
<PB N="92" REF="96">
was the Wife of <HI>Paris</HI>, entering in a violent Hurry, and crying out, <HI>O my dear Count</HI>, inadvertently omitted the Letter <HI>o</HI>, and lay|ing a vehement Accent on the Word, put the Hou&s;e into the loude&s;t Fit of Laughter and Merriment.</P>
<P>Among the many fine Players of this Age Mr. <HI>Sandford</HI> mu&s;t be remembred, and &s;or|ry we are, that we can obtain no other No|tices of him than what we find among the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae</HI> prefixed to the Plays wherein he acted.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> brought three Plays, him|&s;elf, upon the Stage.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Woman</HI> made a <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI>. In this Comedy Mrs. <HI>Long</HI>, a fine Actre&s;s, played the Part of the Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Unju&s;t Judge:</HI> Or, <HI>Appius</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI>. A Tragedy. Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> played <HI>Virginius</HI>, and his Wife <HI>Virginia</HI>.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Amorous Widow:</HI> Or, The <HI>Wanton Wife</HI>. In this Comedy Mr. <HI>Nokes</HI> played Sir <HI>Barnaby Brittle</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Long</HI> Mrs. <HI>Brittle</HI>, in which Part Mrs. <HI>Brace|girdle</HI> &s;ucceeded her.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Plays were well received; but the <HI>La&s;t</HI> only is pre&s;erved, the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>Se|cond</HI> being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that notwith&s;tand|ing Mr. <HI>Otway</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> had very &s;trong Inclinations to come upon the Stage, yet both the&s;e Gentlemen found Writing and Playing
<PB N="93" REF="97">
&s;o widely different, that they were each of them da&s;hed in their fir&s;t Attempt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stage</HI> having worn out the Reign of its Royal Ma&s;ter King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the <HI>Kingdom</HI> having undergone the Grand <HI>Revolu|tion</HI> occa&s;ioned by the Abdication of King <HI>James</HI>, we &s;hall now give an Account of the State of the Theatre under King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>.</P>
<P>A great Difference happening between the United Patentees of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s and the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Companies after the <HI>Revolu|tion</HI>, the chief Actors, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and his Friends, together with Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle, &amp;c.</HI> Repre&s;ented the great Oppre&s;&s;ion they lay under, in a Petition to the Right Honourable <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Dor|&s;et</HI>, &amp;c. then Lord Chamberlain of the Hou&s;hold. This generous Nobleman believ|ing their Complaints to be ju&s;t, did, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir <HI>Robert Howard</HI>, procure for them of their Maje&s;ties a &s;eparate Licen&s;e, con&s;tituting Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI> Patentees. By this Authority they formed a &s;elect Com|pany, and Metamorpho&s;ing the <HI>Tennis-Court</HI> in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</HI>, opened their new Theatre the la&s;t Day of <HI>April</HI> 1695, with a Comedy written by Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> called, <HI>Love for Love</HI>.</P>
<P>In this Company were Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>, Mr. <HI>Sandford</HI>, Mr. <HI>Underhill</HI>, Mr. <HI>Dogget</HI>, Mr. <HI>Verbrugegen</HI>, Mr. <HI>Powell</HI>, Mr. <HI>Mountfort</HI>,
<PB N="94" REF="98">
Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>, Mr. <HI>Penkethman</HI>, Mr. <HI>Bullock</HI>, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, for &s;ome time, leave the&s;e Gen|tlemen in the Di&s;charge of their Profe&s;&s;ion, and re&s;ume the farther In&s;tructions of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> for attaining the <HI>Oratory</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI>, the <HI>Bar</HI>, and the <HI>Pulpit</HI>.</P>
<P>The Management of the <HI>Eyes</HI> in an <HI>Ora|tor</HI> at the <HI>Bar</HI>, or in the <HI>Pulpit</HI>, &s;eems &s;omething different from what they mu&s;t be in a <HI>Player</HI>, tho' if we make the re&s;t of the <HI>Actors</HI> on the <HI>Stage</HI> with him at the &s;ame time, his Auditors, the Rules for <HI>one</HI> will reach the <HI>other</HI>; for &s;o indeed they are, for all the Regard that is to be had to the Au|dience is that they &s;ee and hear di&s;tinctly, what we act and what we &s;peak; that they may judge ju&s;tly of our Po&s;itions, Ge&s;tures and Utterance, in regard to each other.</P>
<P>The Orator therefore mu&s;t always be ca&s;t|ing his Eyes on &s;ome or other of his Audi|tors, and turning them gently from &s;ide to &s;ide with an Air of Regard, &s;ometimes on one Per&s;on, and &s;ometimes on another, and not fix them immoveably on one Part of the Audience, which is extremely unaffecting and dull, much le&s;s moving, than when we look them decently in the Face, as in common Di&s;|cour&s;e. This will hold good in <HI>Playing</HI>, if applied according to my former Rule; for in|deed I have ob&s;erved frequently &s;ome Play|ers, who pa&s;s for great ones, have their Eyes lifted up to the Galleries, or Top of the
<PB N="95" REF="99">
Hou&s;e, when they are engaged in a Di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome Heat, as if indeed they were con|ning a Le&s;&s;on, not acting a Part. <HI>Theophra|&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf condemned <HI>Tamari&s;cus</HI>, a <HI>Player</HI> of his Time, who, whenever he &s;poke on the Stage, turned his Eyes from tho&s;e who were to hear him, and kept them fixt all the while on one &s;ingle and in&s;en&s;ible Object. But Na|ture acts directly in a contrary manner, and yet &s;he ought to be the Player's as well as the Poet's Mi&s;tre&s;s. No Man is engaged in Di&s;pute, or any Argument of Moment, but his Eyes and all his Regard are fixt on the Per&s;on he talks with; not but that there are Times according to the Turn or Cri&s;is of a Pa&s;&s;ion, where the Eyes may with great Beauty be turned from the Object we addre&s;s to &s;everal Ways, as in Appeals to Heaven, imploring A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to join in your Addre&s;|&s;es to any one, and the like.</P>
<P>When we are free from Pa&s;&s;ion, and in any Di&s;cour&s;e which requires no great Motion, as our modern Tragedies too frequently &s;uffer their chief Parts to be, our A&s;pect &s;hould be plea&s;ant, our Looks direct, neither &s;evere nor a&s;ide, unle&s;s we fall into a Pa&s;&s;ion, which requires the contrary. For then Nature, if we obey her Summons, will alter our Looks and Ge&s;tures. Thus when a Man &s;peaks in <HI>Anger</HI>, his Imagination is inflamed, and kin|dles a &s;ort of Fire in his Eyes, which &s;par|kles from them in &s;uch a manner, that a Stranger, who under&s;tood not a Word of the
<PB N="96" REF="100">
Language, or a deaf Man, who could not hear the loude&s;t Tone of his Voice, would not fail of perceiving his Fury and Indignation. And this Fire of their Eyes will ea&s;ily &s;trike tho&s;e of their Audience which are continually fixt on yours; and by a &s;trange &s;ympathetic In|fection, it will &s;et them on fire too with the very &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I would not be mi&s;under&s;tood, when I &s;ay you mu&s;t wholly place your Eyes on the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons you are engaged with on the Stage; I mean, that at the &s;ame time both Parties keep &s;uch a Po&s;ition in regard of the Audience, that even the&s;e Beauties e&s;cape not their Ob&s;ervation, tho' never &s;o ju&s;tly directed. As in a Piece of Hi&s;tory-Painting, tho' the Figures fix their Eyes ever &s;o directly to each other, yet the Beholder, by the Advantage of their Po&s;ition, has a full View of the Expre&s;&s;ion of the Soul in the Eyes of the Figures.</P>
<P>The Looks and ju&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion of all the other Pa&s;&s;ions has the &s;ame Effect, as this we have mentioned of Anger For if the <HI>Grief</HI> of another touches you with a real Compa&s;|&s;ion, Tears will flow from your Eyes, whe|ther you will or not. And this Art of Weep|ing was &s;tudied with great Application by the ancient Players; and they made &s;o extra|ordinary a Progre&s;s in it, and worked the Counterfeit &s;o near a Reality, that their Faces u&s;ed to be all over bedewed with Tears when they came off the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="101">They were likewi&s;e &s;o much affected by acting the&s;e mournful Parts, that they for &s;ome time, when off the Stage, &s;eemed, as I have ob|&s;erved, &s;truck by a real Sorrow to the Heart.</P>
<P>This Behaviour ju&s;tifies what the Antients practi&s;ed in heightning their Theatrical Sor|row, by fixing the Mind on real Objects; or by working the Actor up by a &s;trong Imagination, that he is the very Per&s;on, and in the very &s;ame Circum&s;tances, which will make the Ca&s;e &s;o very much his own, that he will not want Fire in Anger, nor Tears in Grief: And then he need not fear affecting the Audience; for Pa&s;|&s;ions are wonderfully conveyed; the Tears of <HI>one</HI> melting the Heart of the <HI>other</HI>, by a very vi&s;ible Sympathy between their Imaginations and A&s;pects.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t lift up, or ca&s;t down, your Eyes, according to the Nature of the Things you &s;peak of: Thus if of <HI>Heaven</HI>, your Eyes natur|ally are lifted up; if of <HI>Earth</HI>, or <HI>Hell</HI>, or any thing Terre&s;trial, they are as naturally ca&s;t down. Your Eyes mu&s;t al&s;o be directed ac|cording to the Pa&s;&s;ions; as to deject them on Things of Di&s;grace, and which you are a&s;ham'd of; and rai&s;e them on Things of Honour, which you can glory in with Confidence and Reputa|tion. In Swearing, or taking a &s;olemn Oath, or Atte&s;tation of any Thing, to the Verity of what you &s;ay, you turn your Eyes, and in the &s;ame Action lift up your Hand to the Thing you &s;wear by, or atte&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="102">Your Eye-brows mu&s;t neither be immove|able, nor always in Motion: Nor mu&s;t they both be rais'd on every thing that is &s;poken with Eagerne&s;s and Con&s;ent; and much le&s;s mu&s;t one be rais'd, and the other ca&s;t down; but generally they mu&s;t remain in the &s;ame Po&s;ture and Equality, which they have by Na|ture, allowing them their due Motion when the Pa&s;&s;ions require it; that is, to contract them|&s;elves, and frown in <HI>Sorrow</HI>; to &s;mooth and di|late them&s;elves in <HI>Joy</HI>; to hang down in <HI>Hu|mility</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mouth</HI> mu&s;t never be writh'd, nor the <HI>Lips</HI> bit or lick'd, which are all ungenteel and unmannerly Actions, and yet what &s;ome are frequently guilty of; yet in &s;ome Efforts or Starts of Pa&s;&s;ion, the Lips have their Share of Action, but this more on-the Stage, than in any other public Speaking, either in the Pul|pit, or at the Bar; becau&s;e the Stage is, or ought to be, an Imitation of Nature in tho&s;e Actions and Di&s;cour&s;es, which are produced betwixt Man and Man by any Pa&s;&s;ion, or on any Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which can afford Action; for all other has in reality nothing to do with the <HI>Scene</HI>.</P>
<P>Tho' to &s;hrug up the Shoulders be no Ge&s;ture allow'd in Oratory, yet on the Stage the Cha|racter of the Per&s;on, and the Subject of his Di&s;cour&s;e, may render it proper enough; tho' I confe&s;s, it &s;eems more adapted to Come|dy, than Tragedy, where all &s;hould be great and &s;olemn, and with which the grave&s;t of the
<PB N="99" REF="103">
Orators Actions will agree. I have read of a plea&s;ant Method, that <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> took to cure him&s;elf of this Vice of Action, for he at fir&s;t was mightily given to it: He u&s;ed to exerci&s;e him|&s;elf in declaiming in a narrow and &s;treight Place, with a Dagger hung ju&s;t over his Shoul|ders; &s;o that as often as he &s;hrugg'd them up, the Point, by pricking his Shoulders, put him in mind of his Error; which in time remov'd the Defect.</P>
<P>Others thru&s;t out the Belly, and throw back the Head, both Ge&s;tures unbecoming and in|decent.</P>
<P>We come now to the Hands, which, as they are the chief In&s;truments of Action, varying them&s;elves as many Ways, as they are capable of expre&s;&s;ing Things, &s;o is it a difficult Matter to give &s;uch Rules as are without Exception. Tho&s;e Natural Significations of particular Ge|&s;tures, and what I &s;hall here add, will, I hope, be &s;ome Light to the young Actor in this Particular. Fir&s;t, I would have him re|gard the <HI>Action</HI> of the Hands, as to their Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Accu&s;ation, Deprecation, Threats, De&s;ire</HI>, &amp;c. and to weigh well what tho&s;e Actions are, and in what manner expre&s;&s;ed; and then con&s;idering how large a Share tho&s;e Actions have in all Manner of Di&s;cour&s;e, he will find that his Hands need never be idle, or employed in an in&s;ignificant or unbeautiful Ge&s;ture.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="104">In the Beginning of a &s;olemn Speech, or O|ration, as in that of <HI>Anthony</HI> on the Death of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>, or of <HI>Brutus</HI> on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, there is no Ge&s;ture, at lea&s;t of any Con&s;iderati|on, unle&s;s it begin abruptly, as <HI>O</HI> JUPITER, <HI>O Heav'ns! is this to be borne? the very Ships then in our Eyes, which I pre&s;erv'd</HI>, &amp;c. extending here his Hands fir&s;t to <HI>Heaven</HI>, and then to the Ships. In all regular Ge&s;tures of the Hands, they ought perfectly to corre&s;pond with one another; as in &s;tarting in a Maze, on a &s;udden Fright, as <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the Scene betwixt him and his Mother, on the Appearance of his Father's Gho&s;t &mdash;
<Q><L>Save me, and hover o'er me with your Wings,</L>
<L>You Heavenly Guards!</L></Q></P>
<P>This is &s;poke with Arms and Hands extend|ed, and expre&s;&s;ing his Concern, as well as his <HI>Eyes</HI>, and <HI>whole Face</HI>. If an Action comes to be u&s;ed by only one Hand, that mu&s;t be by the <HI>Right</HI>, it being indecent to make a Ge&s;|ture with the <HI>Left</HI> alone; except you &s;hould &s;ay any &s;uch thing as,
<Q><L>Rather than be guilty of &s;o foul a Deed,</L>
<L>I'd cut this Right Hand off, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>For here the Actions mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Left</HI> Hand, becau&s;e the <HI>Right</HI> is the Mem|ber to &s;uffer. When you &s;peak of your&s;elf,
<PB N="101" REF="105">
the <HI>Right</HI> not the <HI>Left</HI> Hand mu&s;t be apply'd to the Bo&s;om, declaring your own Faculties, and Pa&s;&s;ions; your Heart, your Soul, or your Con|&s;cience: But this Action, generally &s;peaking, &s;hould be only apply'd or expre&s;s'd by laying the Hand gently on the Brea&s;t, and not by thumping it as &s;ome People do. The Ge&s;|ture mu&s;t pa&s;s from the <HI>Left</HI> to the <HI>Right</HI>, and there end with Gentlene&s;s and Moderation, at lea&s;t not &s;tretch to the Extremity of Vio|lence. You mu&s;t be &s;ure, as you begin your Action with what you &s;ay, &s;o you mu&s;t end it when you have done &s;peaking; for Action either before or after Utterance is highly ridi|culous. The Movement or Ge&s;tures of your Hands mu&s;t always be agreeable to the Na|ture of the Words, that you &s;peak; for when you &s;ay <HI>Come in</HI>, or <HI>Approach</HI>, you mu&s;t not &s;tretch out your Hand with a repul&s;ive Ge&s;|ture; nor, on the contrary, when you &s;ay, <HI>Stand back</HI>, mu&s;t your Ge&s;ture be inviting; nor mu&s;t you join your Hands, when you command Separation; nor open them, when your Order is <HI>clo&s;ing</HI>; nor hang them down, when you bid <HI>rai&s;e &s;uch a Thing</HI>, or <HI>Per&s;on</HI>; nor lift them up, when you &s;ay <HI>throw them down</HI>. For all the&s;e Ge&s;tures would be &s;o vi|&s;ibly again&s;t Nature, that you would be laugh'd at by all that &s;aw or heard you. By the&s;e In|&s;tances of faulty Action, you may ea&s;ily &s;ee the right, and gather this Rule, that as much as po&s;&s;ible every Ge&s;ture you u&s;e &s;hould expre&s;s the Nature of the Words you utter, which
<PB N="102" REF="106">
would &s;ufficiently and beautifully employ your Hands.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to have any great Emotion or Ge&s;ture of the Body, without the Action of the Hands, to an&s;wer the Figures of Di&s;cour&s;e, which are made u&s;e of in all Poetical, as well as Rhetorical Diction; for Poetry derives its Beauty in that from Rhetoric, as it does its Order and Ju&s;tne&s;s from Grammar; which &s;ur|prizes me, that &s;ome of our modern taking Poets value them&s;elves on that, which is not properly Poetry, but only made u&s;e of as an Ornament, and drawn from other Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>Thus when MEDEA &s;ays,
<Q><L>The&s;e Images of <HI>JASON</HI></L>
<L>With my own Hands I'll &s;trangle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
'tis certain the Action ought to be expre&s;s'd by the Hands, to give it all its Force.</P>
<P>In the lifting up the Hands, to pre&s;erve the Grace, you ought not to rai&s;e them above the Eyes; to &s;tretch them farther might di&s;order and di&s;tort the Body; nor mu&s;t they be very lit|tle lower, becau&s;e that Po&s;ition gives a Beauty to the Figure: Be&s;ides, this Po&s;ture being ge|nerally on &s;ome Surprize, Admiration, Abhor|rence, &amp;c. which proceeds from the Object, that affects the Eye, Nature by a &s;ort of Me|chanic Motion throws the Hands out as Guards to the Eyes on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="107">You mu&s;t never let either of your Hands hang down, as if lame or dead; for that is ve|ry di&s;agreeable to the Eye, and argues no Pa&s;|&s;ion the in Imagination. In &s;hort, your Hands mu&s;t always be in View of your Eyes, and &s;o corre&s;ponding with the Motions of the Head, Eyes, and Body, that the Spectator may &s;ee their Concurrence, every one in its own Way to &s;ignify the &s;ame Thing, which will make a more agreeable, and by Con&s;equence a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on their Sen&s;es, and their Under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Your Arms you &s;hould not &s;tretch out &s;ide-ways, above half a Foot from the Trunk of your Body: You will otherwi&s;e throw your <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> quite out of your Sight, unle&s;s you turn your Head al&s;o a&s;ide to pur&s;ue it, which would be very ridiculous.</P>
<P>In Swearing, Atte&s;tation, or taking any &s;o|lemn Vow or Oath, you mu&s;t rai&s;e your Hand. An Exclamation requires the &s;ame Action: But &s;o that the <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> may not only an&s;wer the <HI>Pronunciation</HI>, or <HI>Utterance</HI>, but both the Na|ture of the Thing, and the Meaning of the Words. In public Speeches, Orations, and Ser|mons, it is true your Hands ought not to be always in Motion, a Vice which was once call'd the <HI>Babbling of the Hands</HI>; and, perhaps, it may reach &s;ome Characters, and Speeches in Plays; but I am of Opinion, that the Hands in Acting ought very &s;eldom to be wholly quie&s;cent, and that if we had the Art of the <HI>Pantomimes</HI>, of
<PB N="104" REF="108">
expre&s;&s;ing Things &s;o clearly with their Hands, as to make the Ge&s;tures &s;upply Words, the joining the&s;e &s;ignificant Actions to the Words and Pa&s;&s;ions ju&s;tly drawn by the Poet, would be no contemptible Grace in the Player, and render the Diver&s;ion infinitely more entertain|ing, than it is at pre&s;ent. For indeed <HI>Action</HI> is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Stage, and an Error is more pardonable on the right, than the wrong Side.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome <HI>Actions</HI> or <HI>Ge&s;tures</HI>, which you mu&s;t never make u&s;e of in Tragedy, any more than in Pleading, or Sermons, they be|ing low, and fi$ter for Comedy or Burle&s;que En|tertainments. Thus you mu&s;t not put your|&s;elf into the Po&s;ture of one <HI>bending a Bow, pre|&s;enting a Mu&s;quet</HI>, or playing on any Mu&s;ical In&s;trument, as if you had it in your Hands.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t never imitate any lewd, ob&s;cene or indecent Po&s;tures, let your Di&s;cour&s;e be on the Debaucheries of the Age, or any Thing of that Nature, which the De&s;cription of an <HI>An|thony</HI> and <HI>Verres</HI> might require our Di&s;cour&s;e of.</P>
<P>When you &s;peak in a <HI>Pro&s;opopaeia</HI>, a Figure by which you introduce any Thing or Per&s;on &s;peaking, you mu&s;t be &s;ure to u&s;e &s;uch Actions only, as are proper for the Character that you &s;peak for. I can't remember at pre&s;ent one in Tragedy; but in Comedy <HI>Melantha</HI>, when &s;he &s;peaks for a Man, and an&s;wers him in her own Per&s;on, may give you &s;ome Image of
<PB N="105" REF="109">
it. But the&s;e &s;eldom happen in Plays, and in Orations not very frequently.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone through the Art of Action or Ge&s;ture, which tho' I have directed it chiefly for the Stage, and there principally for Trage|dy, yet the <HI>Bar</HI>, and the <HI>Pulpit</HI> may learn &s;ome Le&s;&s;ons from what I have &s;aid, that would be of mighty u&s;e to make their Plead|ing and Sermons of more Force and Grace: But, I think, the <HI>Pulpit</HI> chiefly has need of this Doctrine, becau&s;e that conver&s;es more with the Pa&s;&s;ions, than the <HI>Bar</HI>, and treats of more &s;ublime Subjects, meritorious of all the Beauty and Solemnity of Action. I am per&s;uaded, that if our Clergy would apply them|&s;elves more to this Art, what they preach would be more efficacious, and them&s;elves more re&s;pected; nay, have a greater Awe on their Auditors. But then it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible for them to attain this Per|fection, while that Cu&s;tom prevails of read|ing of Sermons, which no Clergy in the World do but tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England</HI>. For while they read, they are not perfect enough in what they deliver, to give it its proper Ac|tion and Empha&s;is, either in Pronunciation or Ge&s;ture. But the TATLER has handled this Particular very well; and if what he has &s;aid will have no Influence upon them, it will be much in vain for me to attempt it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comedians</HI>, I fear, may take it ami&s;s, that I have had little or no Regard to them in
<PB N="106" REF="110">
the&s;e Rules. But, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, tho' I have at|tempted two or three Comical Parts, which the Indulgence of the Town to an old Fellow has given me &s;ome Applau&s;e for; yet Tragedy is, and has always been, my Delight. Be&s;ides, as &s;ome have ob&s;erv'd, that Comedy is le&s;s diffi|cult in the Writing; &s;o I am apt to believe, it is much ea&s;ier in the Acting; not that a good <HI>Comedian</HI> is to be made by every one that at|temps it, but we have had, almo&s;t ever &s;ince I knew the Stage, more and better <HI>Comedians</HI>, than <HI>Tragedians</HI>; as we have better <HI>Comedies</HI> than <HI>Tragedies</HI> writ in our Language, as the Criticks and knowing Judges tell us. But be|ing willing to rai&s;e Tragedies from their pre&s;ent Neglect, to the E&s;teem they had in the mo&s;t polite Nation that ever <HI>Europe</HI> knew, I have endeavour'd to contribute my Part towards the improving of the Repre&s;entation, which has a mighty Influence on the Succe&s;s and E&s;teem of any Thing of this Nature.</P>
<P>We will now proceed to the other Duty of a Player, which is the Art of <HI>Speaking</HI>; which, tho' much the lea&s;t con&s;iderable, yet, accord|ing to our modern <HI>Tragedies</HI>, I mean tho&s;e, which have been be&s;t receiv'd, is of mo&s;t U&s;e. For tho&s;e Poets have very erroneou&s;ly apply'd them&s;elves to write more what re|quires ju&s;t <HI>Speaking</HI>, than ju&s;t Acting: And our Players, generally &s;peaking, fall very much &s;hort of that Excellence, ev'n in this which they ought to aim or arrive at; which but too plainly
<PB N="107" REF="111">
proves what <HI>Ro&s;eneraus</HI> de&s;cribes&mdash;<HI>An Airy of Children, little Ya&s;es, they cry out on the Top of the Que&s;tion, and are mo&s;t tyrannically clapt for't; the&s;e are now the Fa&s;hion, and &s;o berattle the common Stages (&s;o they call 'em) that many wearing Rapiers are afraid of Goo&s;e-Quills, and dare &s;carce come thither</HI>. And tho' what I have before quoted from <HI>Ham|let</HI> (in this Account of the Actor's Action and Behaviour) does happily expre&s;s the Soul and Art of Acting, which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has drawn, the compleat Art of Ge&s;ture in Miniature in the quoted Speech, yet all the Directions, which he gives, relate (except one Line) wholly to <HI>Speaking</HI>.</P>
<P>HAMLET.
<Q>&startq;Speak the Speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it, trippingly on the Tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our Players do, I had as lieve the Town-Cryer had &s;poke my Lines. Nor do not &s;aw the Air too much with your Hand thus, but u&s;e all gently: <HI>For in the very Torrent, Tempe&s;t, and I may &s;ay the Whirlwind of Pa&s;|&s;ion, you mu&s;t acquire and beget a Temperance, that may give it Smoothne&s;s.</HI> Oh! it of|fends me to the Soul to &s;ee a robu&s;tous, <HI>per|riwig-pated</HI> Fellow tear a Pa&s;&s;ion to Tat|ters, to very Rags, to &s;plit the Ears of the Groundlings, who for the mo&s;t part are capable of nothing but inexplicable <HI>dumb Shows</HI> and <HI>Noi&s;e</HI>.

<Q>&startq;Oh! reform it altogether. And let tho&s;e, who play the Clowns, &s;peak no more than is &s;et down for 'em; for there be of them, who will them&s;elves laugh, to &s;et

on &s;ome Quantity of barren Spectators to laugh too; tho' in the mean Time, &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary Que&s;tion of the Play be then to be con&s;ider'd: That's villainous, and &s;hews a &endq;mo&s;t <HI>pitiful Ambition</HI> in the Fool that u&s;es it.</Q></P>
<P>If we &s;hould con&s;ider and weigh the&s;e Dire|ctions well, I am per&s;uaded they are &s;uffi|cient to in&s;truct a young Player in all the Beau|ties of <HI>Utterance</HI>, and to correct all the Errors he might, for want of the Art of Speaking, have incurr'd. By pronouncing it <HI>trippingly on the Tongue</HI>, he means a clear and di&s;em|barra&s;s'd Pronunciation, &s;uch as is agreeable to Nature and the Subject on which he &s;peaks. His telling the Actor, that he had as lieve the Town-Cryer &s;hould &s;peak his Lines, as one that mouth'd them, is very ju&s;t; for if Noi&s;e were an Excellence, I know not who would bear away the Palm, the <HI>Cryer</HI>, or the Player; I'm &s;ure the Town-Cryer would be le&s;s faulty; his Bu&s;ine&s;s requiring Noi&s;e. <HI>Nor do not &s;aw the Air with your Hand thus</HI>, but <HI>u&s;e all</HI> GEN|TLY: This is the only Precept of Action, which is extremely ju&s;t, and agreeable to the No|tions of all, that I have met with on my full Enquiry among my learned Friends, who have read all that has been wrote upon Action, and who reckon <HI>rude</HI> and <HI>boi&s;terous</HI> Ge&s;tures among the faulty: Art always directing a mo|derate and gentle Motion, which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> expre&s;&s;es by <HI>u&s;e all gently</HI>. Be&s;ides, this <HI>&s;aw|ing of the Air</HI>, expre&s;&s;es one who is very much at a Lo&s;s how to dipo&s;e of his Hands, but

knowing that they &s;hould have &s;ome Motion, gives them an aukward Violence. The next Ob&s;ervation is extremely ma&s;terly.&mdash;<HI>For in the very</HI> TORRENT, TEMPEST, <HI>and I may &s;ay the Whirlwind of Pa&s;&s;ion, you mu&s;t acquire and get a Temperance, that may give it</HI> SMOOTHNESS. I remember, among many, an In&s;tance in the Madne&s;s of <HI>Alexander the Great</HI>, in <HI>Lee</HI>'s Play. Mr. <HI>Goodman</HI> al|ways went through it with all the Force the Part requir'd, and yet made not half the Noi&s;e as &s;ome who &s;ucceeded him; who were &s;ure to bellow it out in &s;uch a man|ner, that their Voice would fail them before the End, and lead them to &s;uch a languid and ennervate Hoar&s;ene&s;s, as entirely wanted that agreeable <HI>Smoothne&s;s</HI>, which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> requires, and which is the Perfection of beau|tiful Speaking; for to have a ju&s;t Heat, and Loudne&s;s, and yet a <HI>Smoothne&s;s</HI>, is all that can be de&s;ir'd. <HI>O! it offends me to the Soul</HI>, he goes on. &mdash;Methinks &s;ome of our young Gentlemen, who value them&s;elves for great Players, nay, and Judges too of the <HI>Drama</HI>, &s;et up for Critics, and who cen&s;ure and re|ceive or reject Plays, &s;hould be a&s;ham'd of them&s;elves, when they read this in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>, who&s;e Authority they &s;eem &s;o fond on other Occa&s;ions.</P>

Hence it is, that I extremly la|ment the little Reli&s;h the Gentry of this Na|tion have at pre&s;ent for the ju&s;t and noble Repre&s;entations in &s;ome of our Tragedies.

<P><Q>&startq;I have hardly a Notion, that any Perform|er of Antiquity could &s;urpa&s;s the Action of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> in any of the Occa&s;ions in which he has appeared on our Stage.

</FIGURE> MEMOIRS of Mr. WILKS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Wilks</HI> was de&s;cended from a very good Family in <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI>; in which County all his Predece&s;&s;ors were born. His Fa|ther, <HI>Edward Wilks</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was obliged to leave <HI>England</HI> through Misfortunes, and &s;ome Friends he had in <HI>Ireland</HI> procured him the Po&s;t of be|ing one of the Pur&s;uivants to the Lord Lieute|nant of that Kingdom. He had three Sons, <HI>Ed|ward, Robert</HI>, and <HI>William</HI>. The <HI>Second</HI> of which, our late excellent Comedian, was born at a little Village called <HI>Rathfarnam</HI>, near <HI>Dublin</HI>, 1665. He was bred up under Mr Secretary <HI>Southwell</HI>, and had for &s;ome Years a Seat in his Office; being an excellent Clerk, and wrote a

fine Hand. Upon the Breaking-out of King <HI>James</HI>'s Wars in <HI>Ireland</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> was for|ced into the Army by Capt. <HI>Bourk</HI>, and was exempted from Military Duty, being made Clerk to the Camp. But the natural Propen&s;i|ty of his Genius was wholly turned towards the <HI>Stage</HI>, and hearing &s;o much of the ju&s;t Prai&s;es of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Merit, he was not ea&s;y till he came over, and privately by a Stratagem e&s;cap|ed from his Military Clerk&s;hip.</P>
<P>At his Arrival in <HI>England</HI>, he was indeed en|tertained by Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Rich</HI>; but on no higher Terms than fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week, out of which he was to allow ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month for learning to dance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> was the Ma&s;ter of whom he learnt; and at who&s;e School, after Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> had been above a Year in <HI>England</HI>, he &s;aw a young Gentlewoman of about 20 Years of Age, with whom he fell in Love. This was Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Knapton</HI>, younge&s;t Daughter of <HI>Fer|dinando Knapton</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Town-Clerk of <HI>South|ampton</HI>, and Steward of the <HI>New Fore&s;t</HI>. In due Time &s;he brought Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> a Son, who was chri&s;tened <HI>Robert</HI>. The Child was put to Nur&s;e, and committed to the Guardian&s;hip of Mr: <HI>Bowen</HI> the Player, upon Mr: <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Return to <HI>Ireland</HI>, who took his Wife with him, upon the following Occa&s;ion.</P>

From this Character given of him, Mr. <HI>A&s;hbury</HI> contracted with Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> for 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year certain, and a Benefit-Play.

<P>BARTON BOOTH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was very well de&s;cended, and nearly related to the Earls of <HI>Warrington</HI>; nay, he has a&s;&s;ured me that his Family always looked upon them&s;elves as the Elde&s;t Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Booth</HI>. This excellent Tragedian, was the Son of <HI>John Booth</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> born 1681.</P>
<P><HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> was the County of his Nativity, from whence his Father, with his whole Fami|ly, removed to Town, and &s;ettled at <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter</HI>, 1684. Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> (the younge&s;t of Three Sons) was at nine Years of Age put under the Tuition of the <HI>Celebrated Dr. Busby</HI> under whom he became an excellent Scholar. He &s;hewed, while at School, his great Inclination
<PB N="142" REF="146">
to Poetry; and was very fond of repeating Po|etical Performances and Parts of Plays, in all which he di&s;covered a very promi&s;ing Genius for the Stage. But Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s fir&s;t Encourage|ment in <HI>Acting</HI> came from his Ma&s;ter at the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> of a <HI>Latin Play</HI> in which he performed with general Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The following Part of a <HI>Prologue</HI> was &s;poken at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-School</HI>, which will evidently di&s;|cover their high E&s;teem for Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, as an Actor <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Your Antique Actors, as we read,</L>
<L>No more than Anticks were indeed:</L>

<L>They kept the Countenance from Sight.</L>
<L>Now Faces on the Stage are &s;hown;</L>
<L>Nor &s;peak they with their Tongues alone,</L>
<L>But in each Look a Force there lies,</L>
<L>That &s;peaks the Pa&s;&s;ion to the Eyes.</L>

<P>He remained there Two Years, and acquired the Reputation of a very good Player. He re|turned to <HI>England</HI> in 1701, and applied him&s;elf to Lord <HI>Fitzharding</HI>, a Lord of the Bedcham|ber to Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI>. His Lord|&s;hip recommended him to Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> as a very promi&s;ing Genius, who took him under his Care, and made him what he was. The Part of <HI>Maximus</HI> in <HI>Valentinian</HI> was cho&s;en for his fir&s;t Appearance. Mr. <HI>Verbruggen</HI> play'd <HI>Valentinian</HI>, Mr. <HI>Betterton Etius</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Barry Lucina</HI>. There never was more Applau&s;e expre&s;&s;ed by any Audience, then was given to Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Soon after he again appeared with univer|&s;al Applau&s;e, in the Character of ARTABAN in the <HI>Ambitious Step-Mother</HI>.</P>
<P>In the Year 1704, he married Mrs. <HI>Fran|ces Barkham</HI>, Second Daughter to Sir <HI>William Barkham</HI>, Bart. of <HI>Norfolk</HI>, who died in 1710. without I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>CATO greatly augmented both Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s Fame and Intere&s;t, by procuring him the Fa|vour of Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>, then Secretary of State; who, within a Year after, as a Reward for &s;o much &s;ingular Merit, got him added to the Number of the Managers, by procuring him a &s;pecial Licen&s;e from Queen ANNE.</P>

<P>TWO Advantages di&s;tingui&s;hed him, in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, from the re&s;t of his Fraternity: He had Learning to under&s;tand per|fectly whatever it was his Part to &s;peak; and Judgment to know how far it agreed or di&s;a|greed with his Character. Hence aro&s;e a pe|culiar Grace, which was vi&s;ible to every Spec|tator; tho' few were at the Pains of examin|ing into the Cau&s;e of their Plea&s;ure. He could &s;often and &s;lide over, with a kind of elegant Negligence, the Improprieties in a Part he act|ed, while, on the contrary, he would dwell with Energy upon the Beauties; as if he ex|erted a latent Spirit, which had been kept back for &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, that he might alarm, a|waken, and tran&s;port, in tho&s;e Places only, where the Dignity of his own good Sen&s;e could be &s;upported by that of his Author.</P>
<P>A little Reflection upon this remarkable Quality, will teach us to account for that mani|fe&s;t
<PB N="147" REF="151">
Languor which has &s;ometimes been ob|&s;erv'd in his Action, and which was generally, tho' I think fal&s;ly, imputed to the natural In|dolence of his Temper.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Rea&s;on, tho' in the cu&s;tomary Rounds of his Bu&s;ine&s;s he would conde&s;cend to &s;ome Parts in Comedy, he &s;eldom appear'd in any of them with much Advantage to his Character. The Pa&s;&s;ions which he found in Comedy were not &s;trong enough to excite his Fire; and what &s;eem'd Want of Qualification, was only Ab&s;ence of Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He had a Talent at di&s;covering the Pa&s;&s;ions, where they lay hid in &s;ome celebrated Parts, by the injudicious Practice of other Actors. When he had di&s;cover'd, he &s;oon grew able to expre&s;s them: And his Secret for attaining this great Le&s;&s;on of the Theatre, was an Adaption of his Look to his Voice; by which artful Imita|tion of Nature, the Variations in the Sound of his Words gave Propriety to every Change in his Countenance. So that it was Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s peculiar Felicity to be Heard and Seen the &s;ame, whether as the <HI>Pleas'd</HI>, the <HI>Griev'd</HI>, the <HI>Pitying</HI>, the <HI>Reproachful</HI>, or the <HI>Angry</HI>.</P>
<P>One would almo&s;t be tempted to borrow the Aid of a very bold Figure, and, to expre&s;s this Excellence the more &s;ignificantly, beg Permi&s;|&s;ion to affirm, that the Blind might have &s;een him in his Voice, and the Deaf have heard him in his Vi&s;age.</P>

His Father (when he was very young,) removing from <HI>Litchfield</HI> to <HI>Ut|toxeter</HI>, a Market Town in the &s;ame County, he had his Education in the Grammar School there; which School is always &s;upplied with Ma&s;ters from <HI>Trinity-College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI>, and an yearly Stipend from the &s;aid College allowed for their Support.

Having had a tolerable Education, he was put Apprentice to Mr. <HI>Curll, Book&s;eller</HI>, in the Year 1718.

An Accident of this kind, was looked on as unheard of before.</P>
<P>Both Nature and Inclination had formed him for a very excellent Player, had he lived; and what he was at the Time of his Death, will be &s;een from the following ju&s;t Character given of him by Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>, who buried him in a ve|ry genteel Manner, at his own Expence, at <HI>St. Mary White-Chapel</HI>, in the 35th Year of his Age.

<P>In the Character of the <HI>Country Wife</HI> Mrs. <HI>Bignall</HI>, thro' the whole Action, made a very pretty Figure, and exactly entered in the Nature of the Part.

<HEAD>Mrs. CHRISTIANA HORTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentlewoman is de&s;cended from a very good Family in <HI>Wilt&s;hire:</HI> She was born in the Year 1696. When but a Child, &s;he was bent upon trying the Fate of a <HI>Dramatic Life</HI>, and accordingly engaged her&s;elf with Mr. <HI>Booker</HI>, Ma&s;ter of a Strolling-Company of Play|ers. Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> &s;eeing her act the Part of <HI>Cupid</HI>, in a Droll called <HI>Cupid and P&s;yche</HI>, in <HI>Southwark-Fair</HI>, 1714, and being plea&s;ed
<PB N="164" REF="168">
with her Performance, he brought her on <HI>Dru|ry-Lane</HI> Theatre the Year after. The fir&s;t Part &s;he appeared in was <HI>Melinda</HI>, in the <HI>Re|cruiting Officer</HI>. She remained on that Stage till it was tortured with &s;everal Revolutions, and was, at la&s;t per&s;uaded to leave it for <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre, in the Year 1734, where &s;he now remains.</P>
<P>She played the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Parts in &s;eve|ral Plays with Succe&s;s, even when Mrs. <HI>Old|field</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI> were in their highe&s;t Per|fection; particularly, the Part of Lady <HI>Brump|ton</HI> in the <HI>Funeral</HI>, for which &s;he received the highe&s;t Compliments from Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI>, the Author, and Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> often declar$d that <HI>no one was &s;o capable of playing</HI> Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s <HI>Parts, after her Decea&s;e</HI>, as Mrs. <HI>Horton</HI>. Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> was <HI>of the &s;ame Opinion</HI>, and proved it, by chu&s;ing her to play with him in &s;everal Co|medies, where &s;he appeared in Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Characters. The Part of <HI>Millamant</HI>, in the <HI>Way of the World</HI>, was one of the foremo&s;t, and my Intimacy with Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, at that Time, gave me an Opportunity to be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;he acquitted her&s;elf in this Character to the Satisfaction of that <HI>celebrated Actor</HI>, as well as to the Delight of the Audience.</P>
<P>That &s;he remains, now, in the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Parts, in Comedy, without a Rival, is obvious to every one who frequents the Theatre, and is almo&s;t the only <HI>Copy</HI> that
<PB N="165" REF="169">
can remind us of the excellent <HI>Original</HI>; &s;o much is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Acting reduced from its former Glory. I &s;hall only add one Ob&s;er|vation more, which is, that in the Meridian of Life &s;he retains her <HI>Beauty</HI>, even without the entire Lo&s;s of her <HI>Bloom</HI>, and is, by far, the be&s;t Figure on either Stage.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. CATHARINE RAFTOR.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentlewoman was born in <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1711. She is the Daughter of <HI>William Raftor</HI>, Son of <HI>James Raftor</HI>, E&s;&abque; of the City of <HI>Kilkenny</HI>, in the Kingdom of <HI>Ire|land</HI>; a Gentleman of a very Ancient Roman Catholick Family, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;ider|able E&s;tate, which, at the late Revolution, was forfeited to the Crown, by his Sons being all en|gaged in the Service of King <HI>James</HI>. After the Battle of the <HI>Boyne</HI>, her Father attended his Maje&s;ty to <HI>France</HI>, and obtained a Cap|tain's Commi&s;&s;ion in the <HI>French</HI> King's Service: But growing weary of a Military Life, came to <HI>London</HI>, obtained a Pardon of King <HI>William</HI>, and afterwards married Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Daniel</HI>, Daughter of <HI>Edward Daniel</HI>, an eminent Lea|ther-&s;eller on <HI>Fi&s;h-Street-Hill</HI>, with whom he had a hand&s;ome Fortune. He was bred to the Law; but, being of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="170">
Per&s;ua&s;ion, practi&s;ed under &s;uch Re&s;trictions as prevented his doing any Thing more for his Fa|mily (which was very large) than be&s;towing a genteel Education on them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Raftor</HI> came on the Stage in the Year 1728, and married Mr. <HI>George Clive</HI>, an Attorney at Law, in 1732.</P>
<P>This excellent Actre&s;s, was fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Character of <HI>Dorinda</HI>, in the <HI>Tempe&s;t</HI>. But &s;o exten&s;ive has been her Genius in the <HI>Drama</HI>, that it may be &s;aid, without the lea&s;t Tincture of Flattery, no Woman, at her Age, ever &s;hone, in &s;o great a Variety of Cha|racters, the Truth of which A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>the numerous Li&s;t of her Parts, would, if recited, demon&s;trate</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e our Dramatic Me|moirs with the Sentiments of Mr. Se|cretary <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>, in relation to Theatrical-En|tertainments, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"I cannot, &s;ays he, be of the &s;ame Opinion with the <HI>Reformers of Manners</HI>, in their Severity towards PLAYS; but mu&s;t allow, that a good Play, acted before a well-bred Audience, mu&s;t rai&s;e very proper Incitements to good Beha|viour, and be the mo&s;t quick and mo&s;t pre|vailing Method of giving young People a Turn of Sen&s;e and Breeding.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171">"When the Character, drawn by a judicious Poet, is pre&s;ented by the Per&s;on, the Manner, the Look and the Motion of an accompli&s;hed Player, what may not be brought to pa&s;s by &s;eeing generous Things performed before our Eyes? <HI>The Stage is the be&s;t Mirrour of human Life</HI>; let me therefore recommend the apt U&s;e of a Theatre as the mo&s;t agree|able and ea&s;y Method of making a polite and moral Gentry, which would end in rendering the re&s;t of the People regular in their Beha|viour, and ambitious of laudable Undertakings."</P>
