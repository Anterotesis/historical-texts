<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the BEECH-OIL <HI>Invention,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_I MAKE you a Pre&s;ent of the following Di&s;|cour&s;e; that is, I give you the Book <HI>gratis</HI>. Any Man, who&s;e Thanks are worth receiving, will &s;oon perceive it worth his Thanks: But I &s;hall readily di&s;charge you of the Obligation, if you will re&s;olve to read it carefully.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay carefully, I mean <HI>thinkingly</HI>; that is, either read with Attention, like a Man of Under&s;tanding; be|gin and go through the whole Di&s;cour&s;e &s;edately, and re|&s;olve to weigh and judge impartially of what you meet with, or el&s;e lay down the Book, and trouble you &s;elf no farther. A wi&s;e Man puts him&s;elf upon the Level with
<PB N="4" REF="3">
a Fool, as often as he judges ra&s;hly, and without due Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Subject of the Book being founded upon an Ac|cident, which is like to make a greater Noi&s;e in the World than any Di&s;covery in Trade for the&s;e many Ages pa&s;t, I have thought fit to put my &s;elf to a very con&s;ide|rable Expence, and &s;end it as a Pre&s;ent to the Hou&s;e|keepers of this City.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad, if the Example could &s;tir up in Mer|chants and Trade&s;men of all Orders, a vigorous Applica|tion to Searches after new Di&s;coveries in their re&s;pective Callings.</P>
<P>Such an univer&s;al Bent of Genius would not only en|rich a thou&s;and private Families, but improve our Trade, encrea&s;e our Wealth, and firmly e&s;tabli&s;h the Glory of the Nation.</P>
<P>Many, doubtle&s;s, have heard Talk of this Di&s;covery before the Book comes to their Hands; and mo&s;t of them were po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an Opinion, that 'twas nothing but a Project. If the&s;e Men read as all Men &s;hould read, they will &s;oon be forced to change their Sentiments.</P>
<P>Every Body now will &s;ee an open Demon&s;tration of the Truth of this Fact: And the Tongues of Knaves and Fools will be no more at Liberty to &s;lander what they have not Sen&s;e to comprehend.</P>
<P>Let me therefore &s;eriou&s;ly and with much Earne&s;tne&s;s advi&s;e all Per&s;ons, to who&s;e Peru&s;al this Book &s;hall come, to con&s;ider it as an Opportunity thrown into their Hands by Providence. If a rich Man gets it, he, who knows the Benefit of Riches, will be mo&s;t plea&s;ed with &s;o fair and ea&s;y Means of becoming &s;till richer; and if it falls in the Way of &s;uch who&s;e Circum&s;tances are more narrow,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
'twill from that Time forward be their own Fault if they do not make them&s;elves happy for their whole Lives after.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t complain of a Crime, which is become as general as it is dete&s;table, That mean, low-&s;pirited Incli|nation which prevails among Per&s;ons of all Ranks, to in|dulge Detraction, and &s;pread abroad the common Cries of <HI>Scandal</HI>; People are not &s;atisfied with giving Credit to the <HI>&s;illie&s;t</HI> Fal&s;hoods, but are eager in applying the wor&s;t Interpretation po&s;&s;ible to every new Matter they hear of; and then when their own unrea&s;onable Di&s;tru&s;t has made them think wor&s;e of a Thing than it de&s;erves, they ne|ver re&s;t till they have brought over a thou&s;and Pro&s;elites to their Folly, and &s;tirr'd up a general Odium again&s;t a Devil of their own rai&s;ing: And if, after all their Noi&s;e, their po&s;itive Affirmations, and ob&s;tinate Reproaches, they come to be convinc'd of the Truth, whether they will or no, They think it Attonement enough for the Mi&s;chief they have done, to declare with a grave Face, <HI>That they could not have thought it</HI>.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;tance or remember half the idle Rumours and ridiculous Abu&s;es, which have, with all the grave Formality of Truth, been &s;pread about through Town and Country, with De&s;ign to bla&s;t the Credit of this new Di&s;covery, which can po&s;&s;ibly do no Man Hurt, but on the contrary will &s;ave the Nation Millions of Mo|ney, and give Bread to many thou&s;and Families, when I and all the&s;e empty Pratlers &s;hall be Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</P>
<P>This has made it in a manner nece&s;&s;ary to put my &s;elf to &s;uch an Expence, to re&s;cue the Undertaking from the Hands of Ignorance and Malice, and to make tho&s;e har|den'd Wretches blu&s;h, if it be po&s;&s;ible, who have not only ba&s;ely blacken'd &s;uch a publick Benefit, but mi&s;led great Numbers of well-meaning Men to follow their Example.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">How much more noble and becoming the great and ge|nerous Soul of Man, had been an open and avow'd En|couragement of any Thing, which bore a Face of Pub|lick Good, and Service to our Country?</P>
<P>The&s;e idle Bu&s;ie-bodies, the&s;e Tongue-Champions, who, like a Drum, owe all their Noi&s;e to their being hollow, The&s;e wa&s;pi&s;h, &s;tingle&s;s In&s;ects, ought to know, That the Guilt they practi&s;e is not only a Mi&s;application of their Time, and a Pro&s;titution of their Rea&s;on, but an Act as ba&s;e and villanous as breaking open Hou&s;es, be|cau&s;e it prevents and intercepts a Ble&s;&s;ing, which would chiefly fall upon the Widow and the Orphan.</P>
<P>Nothing can be plainer than the Truth of this; for if any Man or Woman, who think your Judgment clearer than their own, entreat you to advi&s;e them how to act in a doubtful Ca&s;e, and you making u&s;e of the Autho|rity they give you, &s;hould, out of Prejudice, Lazine&s;s, unrea&s;onable Fears, or for want of due Thinking and En|quiry, mi&s;repre&s;ent the Fact, and di&s;appoint them of a pre&s;ent Opportunity to make their Fortunes, which is never like to come again, If after this their Circum&s;tan|ces pinch them, Who but you &s;tand guilty in the Sight of God, of all the Mi&s;eries which fall upon them?</P>
<P>Such is the Ca&s;e before us. The Book in your Hands will give <HI>you</HI>, and every Reader, &s;uch an Opportunity; will lay open and explain the whole Affair, till it is made as clear and vi&s;ible as the Light of Heaven; will confute and expo&s;e to Scorn the Impudence and Folly of tho&s;e idle Cavils and Objections which are made again&s;t it, and demon&s;trate that there is no Hazard run; and that even if there were a Hazard run, it could bear no Pro|portion with the Profit expected; and that tho' it were po&s;&s;ible (which it is not) that all the little Money parted with &s;hould be lo&s;t for ever, the Lo&s;s would be &s;o &s;mall, as hardly to be felt; whereas if the Thing &s;ucceeds, (as
<PB N="7" REF="6">
it &s;hall be made plain it mu&s;t) the Contributor of a Trifle makes his Fortune by the Bargain.</P>
<P>It is worth remarking, that notwith&s;tanding the Vi|rulence, the Malice, which has been &s;o long and &s;o openly profe&s;s'd again&s;t this Undertaking, no Man has found it po&s;&s;ible to &s;tart one probable Objection, or pro|duce one Argument, which all his Subtlety cou'd main|tain again&s;t even the fir&s;t An&s;wer, that was given him.</P>
<P>You, that hear People in Coffee-hou&s;es, or el&s;ewhere, pretending to &s;peak ill of the Invention, or advi&s;e again&s;t it; make This your Te&s;t of their Intention and their Hone&s;ty; Tell them, that Rea&s;on, and not Noi&s;e, &s;hou'd be the End of Talking; and that you will &s;oon be of their Mind, if they can give you any Argument again&s;t the Undertaking, which you cannot an&s;wer: Try them this Way, after you have read the follow|ing Sheets, and you will &s;oon &s;ee Folly in its proper Light, and learn to de&s;pi&s;e, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to, the Impotence of Defamation.</P>
<P>But to the Matter in Hand; <HI>London</HI>, 'tis true, has more Rea&s;on than any City of <HI>Europe</HI> to beware of <HI>Pro|jects</HI>, for they have frequently prov'd ruinous to many of her Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Tricks and Cheats dre&s;s'd up with Artifice, and co|ver'd with the &s;pecious Show of publick Good, or pri|vate Benefit, have tempted many, and made wild Ha|vock among credulous People; but is That a Rea&s;on, why they &s;hou'd never li&s;ten to a new Propo&s;al? No &s;ure! It rather ought to teach them always to weigh a Propo&s;ition well, before they clo&s;e with it; for the &s;ame calm Thought and &s;erious Reflection, which will ea&s;ily convince them of the Security, and firm Foundation of &s;uch an Offer, as is here made them, wou'd as certainly have detected and expos'd the fal&s;e Bottom of the Pro|jects,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
which they &s;uffer'd by, and &s;o prevented their own, and other People's Di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>This word <HI>Project</HI> is now become downright &s;canda|lous, and if we take it in the common Sen&s;e or Accepta|tion, it ought for ever to continue &s;o.</P>
<P>But I wou'd have you di&s;tingui&s;h, that the Bu&s;ine&s;s we are now upon, is no <HI>Project</HI>; 'tis a <HI>Di&s;covery</HI>; A Project is a Notion, which, having no real or vi&s;ible Exi&s;tence, the I&s;&s;ue &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at be&s;t upon a precarious Probability. But a Di&s;covery is a Secret in Nature, or in Art, which having long lain hid, is brought to light by &s;ome fortunate Accident, pretends to nothing, but what Experience ju&s;tifies, and carries its Demon&s;tration along with it.</P>
<P>For Example, The frequent Attempts which have been made, to turn ba&s;er Metals into Gold, commonly called the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone</HI>, the&s;e were <HI>Project</HI>; And the Knowledge of the magnetical Virtue in the Load&s;tone, to which we owe the Compa&s;s, and its va&s;t Improve|ment in the Art of Navigation, this was <HI>Di&s;covery</HI>.</P>
<P>People, who are apt to think &s;lightly of the&s;e Mat|ters, &s;hou'd be taught to know, that the Inventors of u&s;eful Arts were held <HI>Sacred</HI> by the Wi&s;dom of ancient Ages, and &s;o far were People then from the pre&s;ent Practice of di&s;countenancing Endeavours, conducive to the general Intere&s;t of Mankind, that they fell into the quite contrary Extream, and expre&s;s'd the overflowing of their Zeal and good Will, by a downright Idolatry, wor&s;hipping them as Gods, and rai&s;ing Altars, to adorn and eternize their Memory</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Bacchus</HI> made a Deity, for no other Rea&s;on than that he taught the U&s;e of Grapes, and fir&s;t drank Wine with his Cotemporaries, who before were igno|rant
<PB N="9" REF="8">
of any &s;uch extraordinary Vertue, in a Fruit, which was familiar to their Ta&s;t, and grew at large on every Mountain.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom of our Rulers has not, perhaps, enough con&s;ider'd, what a Benefit the Nation wou'd receive from the E&s;tabli&s;hment of what I may call a <HI>College of Arts</HI>, of which I &s;hall one Day &s;peak more at large, and in which our apte&s;t Youth might be in&s;tructed in the Theory of all &s;uch Knowledge, as relates to the Im|provement of our Trade and Manufactures, and then &s;ent abroad into all Parts of the commercial World, with con&s;tant and generous Allowances, to ob&s;erve and com|pare the Practices of other Nations, and labour to im|prove on their Remarks, by any accidental Hints, which &s;uch extended Views might give a Being to; as an En|couragement to which, they &s;hou'd become entitled to certain known and &s;tated Profits, Honours, and Di&s;tinc|tions, if at their Return, they cou'd communicate a Se|cret, u&s;eful to their Country.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving with a very great Concern, that by the unhappy Influence of Cu&s;tom, the Learning mo&s;t in U&s;e among&s;t us, is lea&s;t <HI>U&s;eful</HI>; I think it is <HI>Ramus</HI>, who is &s;omewhere of Opinion, that no Man of Letters ought to value him&s;elf upon his Skill in natural Philo&s;ophy, unle&s;s he can by Application of that Skill demon&s;trate him&s;elf, in the Effects, a better <HI>Gardner, Husbandman</HI>, or <HI>Merchant</HI>, than a common Dealer in tho&s;e Arts; for, &s;ays he, 'tis ju&s;tly we abhor and de&s;pi&s;e the idle O&s;tentation of &s;ophi&s;ticated Univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>'Tis for want of looking out upon the World, and under&s;tanding <HI>Things</HI>, as well as <HI>Books</HI>, that our Men of Learning are not far more &s;erviceable to them&s;elves, and the Publick, than they have hitherto been; Were Prac|tice &s;ub&s;tituted in the Room of Speculation, the good Effects of Knowledge wou'd become as <HI>vi&s;ible</HI>, as they are <HI>excellent</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">Examples be&s;t illu&s;trate an A&s;&s;ertion; and In&s;tances abound upon the Ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P><HI>Thales</HI> the <HI>Mile&s;ian</HI> is the elde&s;t Name in Philo&s;ophy; This good Man endeavouring to convince the Rich and Fortunate of his Time, that true Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in the Practice of &s;everer Virtues than they cared to be ac|quainted with, Experienc'd that the Quality of the In|&s;tructor wou'd be fir&s;t regarded, and then a Judgment form'd upon the Worth of the In&s;truction.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he di&s;cover'd the Di&s;ea&s;e, he apply'd a Remedy; he fore&s;aw in a Year of $lenty, by his Know|ledge in natural Cau&s;es, that the following Sea&s;on wou'd be liable to weather, that mu&s;t damnify the Plants, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially the <HI>Olive-Trees</HI>, a Misfortune which hardly happen'd in an Age in that Country; upon this he finds means to engro&s;s and bargain for all the Oil he cou'd procure, at a very low and incon&s;iderable Rate; The next Year comes on, the Olives are de&s;troy'd, the Commodity ri&s;es mo&s;t prodigiou&s;ly, and &s;o the natural Con&s;equence of this Bargain made him at once the <HI>rich|e&s;t</HI> Man of all his Nation, and the <HI>more natural</HI> Con&s;e|quence of That, was, that every Body pre&s;ently acknow|ledg'd him the <HI>Wi&s;e&s;t</HI>.</P>
<P>I will tell you another Story, and bring the Matter nearer home.</P>
<P>It is not out of &s;ome Men's Remembrance, that a young Gentleman, of no Fortune, a Student at <HI>Oxford</HI>, fell in Love with an Inn-Keeper's Daughter of that Town, who&s;e Circum&s;tances were very narrow; he had Philo&s;ophy enough to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uperfluous Wealth; and Judgment to fore&s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Compe|tence; but Love was Head&s;trong, and too hard for Rea|&s;on, &s;o that, after a Year or two's ineffectual Delay, they bid defiance to their Stars, and had Courage enough
<PB N="11" REF="10">
to marry; The Scholar gain'd a Wife, and lo&s;t a Fellow|&s;hip, the only &s;mall Sub&s;i&s;tence he before depended on.</P>
<P>Our Inn-Keeper often upbraided the Bridegroom with the barren Effects of his Learning, and thought it very &s;trange, as he well might, that while every Body told him, his Son-in-Law was a great Scholar, his whole Stock of Knowledge cou'd not help him to one Penny of his own getting.</P>
<P>Six or &s;even Months after this Marriage, the Father-in-Law dies, mi&s;erably poor, and the Credit, which his Indu&s;try maintain'd in his Life-time, dying with him, the Goods he left behind were &s;eiz'd on by his Credi|tors, and the Student and his young Wife turn'd out of Doors, to eat the Bread of Fortune, where they cou'd find it.</P>
<P>The Wife had a Relation in Town, unable to con|tribute any great A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he took them however in|to a Garret of her Hou&s;e, where the Man cou'd only wa&s;t his Hours between Books and Sighs, while the Partner of his Sorrows made hard &s;hift to pick up a Sup|port by <HI>Knitting Stockings</HI>, at a certain common Price for every Pair.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, by a growing Belly, their Cares at once became more weighty, and their Patience le&s;s fortify'd; The only Subject of their Conver&s;ation now, was their melancholy Dread of what wou'd become of the poor Infant, who was to be born a Beggar.</P>
<P>But &s;itting con&s;tantly together from Morning to Night, the Scholar often fix'd his Eyes with &s;tedfa&s;t Ob&s;ervation on the Motion of his Wife's Fingers, in the dextrous Ma|nagement of her Needles; He took it into his Imagina|tion, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible to contrive a little <HI>Loom</HI>, which might do the Work with much more Ex|pedition.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">This Thought he communicated to his Wife, and join|ing his Head to her Hands, the Endeavour &s;ucceeded to their Wi&s;h, and thus the ingenious <HI>Stocking Loom</HI>, which is &s;o common now, was fir&s;t invented, by which he did not only make him&s;elf and his Family happy, but has left his Nation indebted to him for a Benefit, which en|ables us to export Silk Stockings in great Quantities, and to a va&s;t Advantage, to th$&s;e very Countries, from whence before, we us'd to bring them at con&s;iderable Lo&s;s in the Balance of our Traffick.</P>
<P>A Thou&s;and like Improvements in every Trade, and every Nation, may, and will undoubtedly be made, when Accident or Nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall &s;tir up the Imagination of indu&s;trious Men, to draw a&s;ide the Veil, which now conceals them.</P>
<P>I know not any Thing, which is a greater national Misfortune, than a general Bya&s;s towards en&s;laving Judg|ment to Succe&s;s; we &s;eldom Mea&s;ure our Opinions by the Rea&s;on of the Point in Que&s;tion, but the previous Fortune of &s;ome Matter like it; Thus, if it happens, that a great and noble Undertaking, by &s;ome Accident has fail'd of the Succe&s;s expected, every Propo&s;al, which has the Misfortune to come after it, is without Exami|nation compar'd to it, and condemn'd by Whole&s;ale; and if on the contrary, any idle Project has &s;ucceeded well, Whatever ra&s;h, ridiculous Attempt has the good Luck to follow That, is &s;ure to be encourag'd, and cry'd up, with as unjudging and precipitate a Violence, as the contrary had been decry'd and vilify'd.</P>
<P>I will In&s;tance this in a particular Ca&s;e or two, which almo&s;t every Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s can remember:</P>
<P>Captain <HI>William Phipps</HI>, who was afterwards made Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> for his good Fortune, came over from <HI>New England</HI> in the Year 1687, and prevail'd upon the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI>, Sir <HI>James Hays</HI>, and &s;everal other Gentlemen, to &s;end him back with a good Ship, and all Things nece&s;&s;ary, to dive, or <HI>fi&s;h</HI>, as I may call it, for a great Heap of Gold and Silver, which lay at the Bottom of the Sea, God knows how many Fathoms deep, in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, that had been ca&s;t away in the <HI>We&s;t In|dies</HI>; Never &s;ure were any Men of common Sen&s;e em|bark'd in a more unpromi&s;ing Adventure; 'twas above a Million to one again&s;t them, and if they had fail'd, the Attempt had been made the &s;tanding Je&s;t of the whole Nation; but they &s;ucceeded even again&s;t all Pro&s;pect of Probability, and were enrich'd by the Accident; and the Con&s;equence of this was, that a thou&s;and Families have been &s;ince undone, by &s;ending their E&s;tates a Diving af|ter Shipwreck'd Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the contrary, there have, &s;ince that Time, been &s;et on Foot two <HI>Un&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> Undertakings; The making of <HI>Salt-Petre</HI>, and the <HI>Mine-Adventure</HI>; one of which, in my Opinion, &s;eems at lea&s;t to have been founded on a very probable Expectation; but it happen'd, that they fail'd the Hopes of tho&s;e concern'd, and every Thing that has been &s;ince propos'd, is pre&s;ently rejected with a &s;illy Grin; a Shake of the Head, and, <HI>Ay, This is ju&s;t &s;uch a great Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch an enriching, profitable Pro|ject, as the</HI> Salt-Petre <HI>Works, and the</HI> Mine-Adventure.</P>
<P>A rea&s;onable Man &s;hou'd be a&s;ham'd of &s;hooting thus at Random; it is not only a private Folly, but a national Di&s;advantage, that we indulge our &s;elves in &s;uch little narrow Views of Things; The&s;e confin'd and &s;elfi&s;h Un|der&s;tandings generally di&s;tingui&s;h ignorant Men; you &s;hall never fail to know a Fool, by his abounding with Impo&s;&s;ibilities, and you may pre&s;ently &s;et your Mark upon a Man, who tells you, he can't believe &s;uch and &s;uch a Thing, <HI>becau&s;e, if it had been in Nature, it had certainly been found out before our Time</HI>; Had all our An|ce&s;tors been ju&s;t as wi&s;e as He, they might have held their Hands in their Pockets, and gravely concluded,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
that <HI>Apricocks</HI> and <HI>Peaches</HI>, and <HI>Hops</HI> and <HI>Cherries</HI> wou'd not have grown in <HI>England</HI>, for it is not much above an Age, &s;ince they knew it by Experience.</P>
<P>Can any Thing be ea&s;ier or le&s;s dangerous, than to hear at large, what a Man can &s;ay for any Scheme he has to offer? Our Opinion is our own &s;till, and we may judge as we think proper; but to refu&s;e to be con|vinc'd, and then conclude a Thing impo&s;&s;ible, is like winking hard at Noon-Day, and &s;wearing, It is Mid|night.</P>
<P>A free and open Ear &s;hou'd &s;till be lent to all Pre|tences for the publick Good, or indeed towards better|ing a Man's private Condition; we can lo&s;e nothing by li&s;tening, and may without the &s;malle&s;t Hazard re|ject the <HI>Bad</HI>, and embrace the <HI>Good</HI> of every new Pro|po&s;al.</P>
<P>Had &s;uch a Spirit as this prevail'd among&s;t us, the War we have &s;o much complain'd of, had been found no Burthen; Our Taxes had been equal, ea&s;y, and un|felt; Our Fi&s;hery had not been the Trea&s;ure of the Dutch; Our Trade had been enlarg'd; Our Lands im|prov'd; Our People multiplied; And our <HI>Poor</HI> in&s;tead of crowding our Streets with Objects of Mi&s;ery, had been made a happy Means of new Advantages and Honour to the Nation.</P>
<P>But <HI>England</HI> is not chang'd from what &s;he was of old; Her cunning Natives have been ever thus &s;harp-fighted in di&s;covering <HI>Impo&s;&s;ibilities</HI>; a mo&s;t unhappy Genius! which often makes us <HI>laugh</HI> indeed, tho' we very rarely chance to <HI>win</HI> by it.</P>
<P>The Honour of di&s;covering the new World might have been ours, but that our then Politicians were mer|rily di&s;pos'd, and laugh'd us out of the Wealth of the Indies.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">Had <HI>Columbus</HI> &s;ail'd for <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, of <HI>Eng|land</HI>, as he did for <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>, we had <HI>really</HI> as well as <HI>nominally</HI> held the Balance of <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>

<P>'Tis an amazing Reflection, that a Man can put on his Shoes, his Shirt, his Coat; That he can eat Bread, drink Wine, or Ale, or read or write, or do any, even the commone&s;t and mo&s;t familiar Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life, with|out remembring that he owes the very Power of doing what he is about, to a Ble&s;&s;ing of humane Nature, which he is every Day prophaning, under the Name of <HI>Project</HI>.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ignorant Clodpate in a whole Knot of Pro|ject-Killers daily warms him&s;elf by as good a Fire as he can get; he knows that it burns and has Heat, becau&s;e it makes him rub his Shins, when he &s;its too clo&s;e to it; but ask him for a Rea&s;on, why it does &s;o, and he can give you none, <HI>but becau&s;e it does &s;o</HI>; Cu&s;tom has made the Fact familiar to his Sen&s;es, and he never contemplates the Strangene&s;s of the Object.</P>

<P>Let him but look back, and con&s;ider him&s;elf as born in one of the Infant Ages of the World, before the Art of <HI>Writing</HI>, or making Paper was di&s;cover'd; and a thou&s;and to one but he had laugh'd till his Sides &s;hook, when fir&s;t he heard talk of a new Project, that was on Foot, for&s;ooth, to conver&s;e with one another at a hun|dred Miles di&s;tance, and explain a Man's Thoughts to a Friend without &s;peaking a Word, by &s;ending him a Par|cel of black Marks, drawn out with a Pencil upon the inner Bark of a Cherry-Tree.</P>
<P>As common as the&s;e Things are become now, they had a Beginning, and were undoubtedly con&s;ider'd by un|thinking Men, in as &s;illy a Light as I place them; &s;o will a thou&s;and great Inventions more, which if any Body were to &s;et about in publick, People wou'd look upon him as no better than a Madman.</P>

<P><HI>Old Stow</HI> and many other Authors will inform you, what prodigious Slanders, Calumnies and Oppo&s;ition, That noble and u&s;eful Undertaking of the New River met with, even to the Ruin of the poor Gentleman who fir&s;t attempted it: But Experience having now con|vinc'd the World, that &s;uch a Thing was po&s;&s;ible, the Malice is forgotten with the Glory, and it cea&s;es to be a Wonder:</P>
<P>Every Body remembers with a malicious Plea&s;ure the Di&s;appointments, which have been occa&s;ion'd by a few unfortunate Endeavours, and can too readily apply the Examples upon all Occa&s;ions; but no Man takes Pains
<PB N="17" REF="16">
to carry in his Memory the <HI>fortunate</HI> Adventures and Di&s;coveries, which have been made, tho' in Number far &s;uperior to the other.</P>
<P>For Example, 'tis not much above four&s;core Years ago, that an hone&s;t plain Man di&s;cover'd the Way of <HI>burning Bricks with Sea-Coal</HI>, and began to practi&s;e it in Publick at his own Works; Upon this the re&s;t of his Fraternity, with all the common Inhumanity of Malice, derided, and expos'd him; in&s;omuch that his Attempt became the &s;tanding Banter of their &s;illy Clubs, and made up all their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>They went on thus merrily, 'till at the End of a Year or two, in the mid&s;t of their Plea&s;antry, their Trade fell off at once, by the Increa&s;e of their Rival's Bu&s;ine&s;s, and they &s;aw them&s;elves reduc'd to a Nece&s;&s;ity of quitting their old beaten Road to follow that, which they had made &s;o free with, or they mu&s;t &s;oon have wanted Bread to the good Drink, they had been &s;o merry over.</P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was, I think, the fir&s;t who encourag'd and &s;et on Foot, the Art of making here in <HI>England</HI>, that fine clear Sort of Gla&s;s for Coaches, and the Pannels between Chamber-Windows; He was follow'd with Succe&s;s by &s;ome other ingenious Men, and every Body knows, that now, in&s;tead of paying va&s;t Sums of Money every Year to <HI>Italy</HI> for this kind of Ware, we make as fine Gla&s;s as any in the World, and that our Merchants export great Quantities to their con&s;iderable Profit, and the Nations no &s;mall Advantage.</P>
<P>In <HI>Venice</HI> this Art of improving Gla&s;s was carried to a yet higher Perfection; for a certain Trade&s;man of that City had invented a Way to make it malleable, that is, to lo&s;e its brittle Nature, and to bear beating into any Form with a Hammer, like a Piece of Iron, without be|ing robb'd of its Tran&s;parency, and the Reward this no|ble

Di&s;coverer met with for his Pains, was, that the Gla&s;s-Makers found Means to hire a Set of Ruffians to dog him in a dark Night, as he came from the Opera, who tied a Stone about his Neck, and drown'd him in one of the common Water Cour&s;es of the City.</P>
<P>All <HI>Europe</HI> knows, that <HI>France</HI>, almo&s;t in the Minority of her pre&s;ent King, was forc'd, at a mo&s;t prodigious annual Expence, to buy her Silks from <HI>Italy. Mulberries, 'twas plain, would never grow in that cold Country, and the Silk Manufacture could not be expected to thrive &s;o much nearer to the North: Their Fro&s;ts would kill the Worms; or, if not, the Pr$fit of their Labour would be doubly eat out by the Charges</HI>.</P>
<P>In the Mid&s;t of all the&s;e <HI>invincible</HI> Difficulties, Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Colbert</HI>, and certain other great Spirits among them, de&s;pi&s;ing the common Cant of &s;uch ridiculous Ob|jections, re&s;olved at lea&s;t to put it to a Tryal, and found it at once inexpre&s;&s;ibly ea&s;y, and immen&s;ely profitable. Their King's Revenue richly feels the Benefit of the&s;e Gentlemens Indu&s;try; and the <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> Silk Trade of tho&s;e Parts now gives Sub&s;i&s;tence to above a hundred thou&s;and of their Families.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>France</HI>, as well as <HI>England</HI>, produces &s;ome of the&s;e Lethargick Animals: But in the Ca&s;e before us, publick Experience made them blu&s;h at the Remem|brance of their Ignorance; and to atone for pa&s;t Folly, they fell in among the foremo&s;t to the Practice of this Art, which has added &s;o much Honour to the Name of <HI>France</HI>, and &s;uch a Trea&s;ure to their Country.</P>
<P>So that admit a <HI>French</HI> Man heavy, he is not, we &s;ee, <HI>incorrigible</HI>. Example has at wor&s;t the Power to animate the heavie&s;t of their Clods: But let us compare the <HI>French</HI> Men of tho&s;e Days with their Cotemporaries of our I&s;land, and their Darkne&s;s will appear bright, by the Inequality of the Compari&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"><HI>England</HI> had then a Prince upon her Throne, as watch|ful for his Country's Good as any Monarch who has reign'd before or after him.

<P>You &s;ee here a King, endeavouring by the Force of promi&s;ed Rewards and threatned Puni&s;hments, to make his People only &s;en&s;ible of their own Intere&s;t, and con|de&s;cending even to play the Gardener and the Seed&s;man to accompli&s;h his De&s;ign. And what do you think was the Effect of all his Rea&s;ons? Why &s;carce a Man thought decently of his Attempt; Not a Seed was &s;own; Not a Tree was planted; But the merry Creatures laugh'd immoderately at their good old Sovere$gn's being turn'd <HI>Projector</HI>, while they univer&s;ally neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed the Excellence of his Intention.</P>
<P>After This I hope you will not wonder, that the In|du&s;try of private Men is mi&s;interpreted, malign'd, and render'd fruitle&s;s, when a mighty King, with all his Strength of Power and Per&s;ua&s;ion, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a People who had &s;worn Obedience to his Orders, could meet no better Succe&s;s in Pur&s;uit of an Attempt which he begun, and pu&s;h'd, with &s;uch a generous Ve|hemence.</P>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="22">Even our boa&s;ted Woollen Manufacture is in a manner new among&s;t us. Every Body knows that till the Reign of one of our <HI>Edwards</HI>, we were forc'd to &s;end abroad our unwrought Wool to <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and other Places, there to be made into Cloth, and then brought back, and &s;old to us again at a Price &s;o extravagant, that the Nation was <HI>impoveri&s;hed</HI> by the very Wool, which has &s;ince tho&s;e Times been found the only Means of making us a <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Flouri&s;hing</HI> People; So nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial is a due Encouragement of national Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce a Silk-Weaver, Hatter, Powterer, or any other Trade&s;man among&s;t us, but can remember, if he plea&s;es, what va&s;t Improvements, in his particular Calling, he has in his own Time been a Witne&s;s to the Di&s;covery of.</P>
<P>But to bring this Argument &s;till clo&s;er to our Purpo&s;e, there is a common Trade now carried on in every Cor|ner of <HI>Great Britain</HI>, and which is therefore never taken Notice of as a Thing extraordinary; I mean the <HI>Rape-Trade</HI>; that is, the making great Quantities of <HI>Oil</HI> from <HI>Rape-Seed</HI>, or <HI>Cole-Seed</HI>, which is po&s;itively the cleare&s;t and the fulle&s;t Proof that can be wi&s;h'd for, of the Profit and Infallibility of the <HI>B$$$h-Oil Di&s;covery:</HI> And he who fir&s;t brought into Practice this Rape-Oil Trade, wanted nothing but the Prudence of &s;olliciting a Patent, which he was undoubtedly entitled to, to have made him&s;elf the Ma&s;ter of as great a Fortune as any in the Kingdom. Hundreds yearly at this very Day get E&s;tates by that Trade, which at Four Shillings a Bu&s;hel p$oduces <HI>le&s;s</HI> Oil, and far <HI>wor&s;e</HI>, than our Beech-Ma&s;t, which can never co&s;t Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>The Land that bears this Rape is let at an extraordi|nary Rent, and cultivated at a va&s;t and con&s;tant Expence. The Seed is &s;ow'd and reap'd with much Toil and Hazard, and all this Pains and Charge mu&s;t be repeated annually;
<PB N="$$" REF="23">
whereas in making Beech-Oil, we have, without any ploughing or &s;owing, a common Fore&s;t Product to work upon, more plentiful in mo&s;t Places than the very Acorns, and of le&s;s reputed Value, as will by and by be prov'd be|yond a Po&s;&s;ibility of Contradiction. Our Charges there|fore can be nothing but the Price of &s;haking the Trees, and &s;weeping up our Harve&s;t, of which, one Bu&s;hel, as you may &s;ee experienc'd every Day, yields more Oil, and better, than the &s;ame Quantity of Rape-Seed, and yet the Rape-Seed is obtain'd at almo&s;t ten times the Hazard, Expence and Inconvenience.</P>
<P>I will add a Word or two in general by way of Ad|vice, That, to prevent a frequent Overlooking &s;uch Ad|vantages as the&s;e, People would begin to think a little more of their private Bu&s;ine&s;s, and trouble them&s;elves le&s;s with the Concerns of the Publick; and then I ha&s;ten more particularly to the De&s;ign in Hand.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for any Man, but one who has expe|rienc'd it, &s;o much as to imagine what a Number of the&s;e profitable Secrets might be ea&s;ily di&s;covered. This is a Way of growing rich, not only far more ready, but more delightful too, than any of the common ones. It makes a Thou&s;and other Peoples Fortunes, at the &s;ame Time that it improves your own.</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t afraid to venture &s;uch a Declaration among the di&s;ingenuous Tempers of Mankind, or I could in|&s;tance and di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome Six or Seven &s;uch Examples, which I have my &s;elf di&s;cover'd in my &s;mall Pur&s;uit of Nature, as might animate the dulle&s;t Clod, and would perhaps awake the &s;leepy Genius of our Nation.</P>
<P>It wou'd be very ill-natur'd to put a wrong Interpre|tation upon my Meaning in this Place; I wou'd not have you believe, I lo$k upon my &s;elf, as Ma&s;ter of a &s;harper Sight than other People. That Kind of Vanity, if a Man

can know him&s;elf, is not my Fault, and I readily declare, that there is no great Merit in Di&s;coveries of this Na|ture: They are meerly owing to a Virtue very common, but generally mi&s;apply'd; The plain Effect of downright Indu&s;try, and Thinking a little out of the beaten Road.</P>
<P>If any Body wonders then that &s;uch Di&s;coveries are not more frequent, &s;ince we have a great many wi&s;e and indu&s;trious Men in <HI>England</HI>, the An&s;wer is plain; Mo&s;t Men are from their Infancy de&s;ign'd to &s;ome particular Way of Life; They are either born to E&s;tates, which draw them on to Plea&s;ures, incompatible with the Seve|rity of Thinking, Or they are bred to Divinity, or Law, or Trade, or &s;ome known Track of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Per&s;uit of which gives them no Lei&s;ure to think of other Mat|ters, and brings them in a <HI>certain little</HI> Profit, which they think it imprudent to abandon for an <HI>uncertain Greater</HI>; Or they are bu&s;ied in Endeavours to procure and pre&s;erve &s;ome great Man's Favour; Th$y are looking $ut for Po&s;ts at Court, or el&s;ewhere; Thus in different Spheres, the Generality of Mankind are engag'd in Appli|cations, which requiring all thei$ Stock of Thought, leave them no Room to trace &s;uch Views, as I am &s;peak|ing of; which, however ea&s;y to the Search, mu&s;t, not|with&s;tanding, be the Product of Solitude and Retirement.</P>
<P>To be a little more particular, and ju&s;tify the general A&s;&s;urance I ju&s;t now gave you; that my own Experience has demon&s;trated, how very well worth a Man's while it is, to bend his Thoughts this Way; I think my &s;elf oblig'd to declare, at lea&s;t by two or three Examples, upon what Founda$ions I took the Liberty to &s;peak in that manner.</P>

buy at a con&s;iderable Charge; And yet there is a com|mon Vegetable, almo&s;t the Growth of every Hedge, which yields a Wax, even finer than this Bees-Wax, at an Expence &s;o incon&s;iderab$e, that I am very &s;ure, and cou'd prove it, if I pleas'd, that in the Practice of the Thing, a Pound of &s;uch Wax-Candles wou'd not co&s;t Three Half-pence:</P>
<P>And here, to &s;poil the Sport of a few &s;hallow Wretches, who are very fond of an Opportunity, to expo&s;e them|&s;elves to the Remark of an old Proverb, That the great|e&s;t Fool is the loude&s;t Laugher; I mu&s;t inform them, That as &s;trange a Secret, as they will think this, there is nothing of wonder in it; for every Sea-Captain, who has been us'd to Trade upon the Continent of <HI>America</HI>, is very well acquainted with the <HI>Myrtle Wax-Candles</HI> of <HI>Carolina, Virginia</HI>, and other Plantations.</P>
<P>Now, if in the&s;e Countries, which have been &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>, it is a u&s;ual Thing to make Wax-Candles of a common Berry which grows upon the Myrtle-Tree, pray which in Rea&s;on ought to be e&s;teem'd the greate&s;t Wonder?

<HEAD>AN EXPLANATION OF THE DISCOVERY.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT you may the better under&s;tand, what this Di&s;covery means, and what predigious Benefit will accrue to the Nation by it, you mu&s;t fir&s;t know, that the two great Trades of the Soap-maker and Clothier do wholly depend upon Oil, which is for the mo&s;t Part brought in from beyond-Sea, and co&s;ts the Nation many Millions, as you will &s;ee plainly prov'd, beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of Contradiction.</P>
<P>There is in all the Fore&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> a very common Tree, call'd a Beech-Tree; much larger than the Oak; There are va&s;t Woods almo&s;t every where, of nothing el&s;e but this Beech; mo&s;t of our Noblemen, and private Gentlemen have large Quantities, and &s;ome of them &s;e|veral thou&s;and Acres of Beech in their own E&s;tates, as particularly the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>, the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI>,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
the Earl of <HI>Scarborough</HI>, the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI>, and an endle&s;s Number more in all Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>There are within forty Miles round <HI>London</HI>, many hundred thou&s;and Acres of full grown, bearing Beech, almo&s;t without any other Tree intermix'd with them.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than for one of the&s;e Beech-Trees to bear fifty Bu&s;hels of that three corner'd Beech-Ma&s;t, of which y$u have a Sample &s;ent you with this Book, as you al&s;o have of the outward Husk, in which it grows, tho' I don't reckon the Husk, but the Ker|nels only, when I &s;ay that it is a common Thing for one Tree to bear fifty Bu&s;hels of Beech-Ma&s;t.</P>
<P>About the latter End of <HI>September</HI>, the Husks, which hang like Ropes of Onions, and weigh down the Bran|ches, open of their own Accord, and let fall the Ma&s;t, three corner'd as you &s;ee it, in &s;uch va&s;t Quantity, that the Ground is every where cover'd over with it &s;everal Inches deep.</P>
<P>Some Part of This the Hogs devour, or in Parks the Deer; The re&s;t, having no known U&s;e, lies rotting on the Ground, and Spoils the Herbage. 'Tis hardly ever known to be gather'd, and when it is, the Poor have Six-pence, or Eight-pence a Bu&s;hel for picking it up, and carrying it to &s;ome hone&s;t Farmer's Wife, for a fa|vourite Hog, or &s;o, that is to be kill'd again&s;t Chri&s;t|mas.</P>
<P>Now the Di&s;covery is This; That every Bu&s;hel of This common Ma&s;t, which has lain neglected and de&s;pi|&s;ed for &s;o many Ages, is found to yield two Gallons of much better Oil, than That made of Olives, which the Clothiers and Soap-Makers call <HI>Seville-Oil</HI>, or <HI>Galipoli-Oil</HI>, and for which the Nation pays &s;uch prodigious Sums of Money to Foreigners.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">So that This Di&s;covery, hitherto a Secret, adds an Honour, and a Profit to the Publick; and may therefore fairly be allow'd to give a private Benefit to him, who brings it into Practice; And the Malice and Ill-nature it has met with, will be condemn'd by every hone&s;t Man, as a Di&s;couragement to Indu&s;try, and di&s;honourable to the Character of our Countrymen in General.</P>
<P>You are not de&s;ir'd to take my Word for any Thing, I have affirm'd; you &s;hall in the following Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, have &s;uch undeniable Proofs, and Demon|&s;tration, that no Man in his Sen&s;es will pre&s;ume hereafter to open his Mouth in Oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>An Account of the Time When, and man|ner How, This Di&s;covery was fir&s;t made.</HEAD>
<P>I Was a Boy, not quite fifteen Years old, when I fir&s;t left <HI>England</HI>, in the Year 1699, and began tho&s;e Travels, which, till a few Years &s;ince, kept me out a con&s;tant Wanderer over mo&s;t Parts of the World.</P>
<P>I came in the Year 1700, to <HI>Naples</HI>, where carele&s;ly neglecting a little Cold, I had got, it became on a Sudden very trouble&s;ome and violent.</P>
<P>I apply'd my &s;elf for Advice to an Apothecary, at who&s;e Hou&s;e I happen'd to lodge, and after &s;everal un|&s;ucce&s;sful Attempts in his common Rules, he de&s;ir'd me to drink a pretty large Quantity of Oil of &s;weet Almonds.</P>
<P>I had a very &s;trong Aver&s;ion to Oil, of any Kind, and cou'd not be prevail'd upon to follow this Advice,
<PB N="34" REF="33">
till he told me, that if I lov'd the Almonds them&s;elves, I cou'd not di&s;like their Oil, which was pure, and &s;im|ple, and obtain'd by only pounding, and pre&s;&s;ing them; And that if I wou'd, I &s;hou'd &s;ee the Manner they us'd to make it in.</P>
<P>I accepted This offer, and &s;tood by, while his Servant weigh'd out a Parcel of Almonds, and throwing them into a large Mortar, beat them a long Time with a heavy Iron $e&s;tle; I ob&s;erv'd that the broken Almonds, the finer they were pounded, grew more and more Oily, and &s;tuck better together, till at la&s;t they be|came a clammy Sub&s;tance between a Powder and a Pa&s;te.</P>
<P>The Almonds thus beaten, were put into a thick li|nen Bag, and placed between two meeting Parts of a &s;trong wooden Pre&s;s, which were forc'd hard together by the turning of an Iron Skrew; After &s;ome &s;mall Time the Oil began to drop pretty fa&s;t, and continu'd to do &s;o, till the Apothecary had got the Quantity, proper for my Purpo&s;e; which having thus &s;een drawn, I took without any Difficulty, and it was perfectly &s;uc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>I went a few Days after, with an <HI>Italian</HI> Fryar, to &s;ee the burning Mountain <HI>V$&s;uvius</HI>; The Cave, The Grotto, The Tomb of <HI>Virgil</HI>, and many other Rarities of that celebrated Neighbourhood, And happening one Day to take a By-Road for Expedition, we cro&s;s'd a very large Wood, which, as I afterwards ob&s;erv'd, was al|mo&s;t all <HI>Beech</HI>; As we rode along, The Boughs, which were at that Time overloaded with full-ripe Ma&s;t, hung low and were exce$ding Trouble&s;ome, &s;o that I was of|ten forc'd to bend forward upon my Hor&s;e, and to make U&s;e of a &s;trong Stick to guard off the Branches, as we rode clo&s;e under them:</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">The Boughs, as we pa&s;s'd on, being thus re&s;i&s;ted by our Sticks, and the Husks of the Ma&s;t open, as they al|ways are, when their Fruit is ripe, the Kernels, by the Motion of the Branches, fell down upon us as thick as Ha$l; and when I came out of the Wood, I found abun|dance of them, which had re&s;ted upon my Hat, and which out of a trifling Curio&s;ity, to know what they had within them, or rather merely by Chance, I put carele&s;ly into my Pocket.</P>
<P>But when I had opened and eat &s;everal, and found them &s;o unexpectedly &s;weet and plea&s;ant, I ask'd the Fa|ther what This Fruit was call'd, and was then fir&s;t taught to know a Beech-Tree.</P>
<P>The Similitude in Ta&s;te between a new Almond, and the Beech-Ma&s;t, ju&s;t fall'n from the Trees, imme|diately brought to my Remembrance the Oil, which had &s;o lately cur'd my Cold, and the ea&s;y manner of making it; &s;urely, thought I, as the Sub&s;tance and Ta&s;te of the&s;e two Things are &s;o near alike, their Effects can never be &s;o different, but that the Beech mu&s;t afford as good an Oil, as the Almond Tree.</P>
<P>I re&s;olv'd, however, to make an Experiment, and took Care in my Return, to get a Quart or two of Beech-Ma&s;t, and having hung it a whole Night in a linen Bag, near a &s;mall Fire, to dry away That watry Part, which you may ob&s;erve predominant in Filberds, and Walnuts, till they have been a good while kept; I pounded them in a Mortar, and when they were re|duc'd with Shell and all to a proper Sub&s;tance, I got the Apothecary's Pre&s;s, and went to work the &s;ame Way, I had before ob&s;erv'd him take with the Al|monds.</P>
<P>I was rather pleas'd than &s;urpriz'd, to find my &s;elf &s;o far from being mi&s;taken, that the Oil was more in Quan|tity
<PB N="$$" REF="35">
than had been drawn from an equal Weight of Al|monds, and the Apothecary not knowing, what it really was, after having &s;everal Times ta&s;ted it, declar'd that it was the fine&s;t Oil of Almonds that ever he &s;aw drawn.</P>
<P>Thus far my natural Curio&s;ity had led me; and here for want of Years, or Judgment, or an early Know|ledge in the Principles of Trade, I had lo&s;t the Advan|tage of this fortunate and rich Di&s;covery, had not Chance retriev'd it.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Naples</HI> &s;oon after this, and carried the Oil along with me in a little Cry&s;tal Bottle, with De&s;ign to try, if it wou'd keep long in the warm Countries, I was going into; I pre&s;erv'd it above a Year, and all that Time it grew better and better, till at la&s;t by frequent changing Places, it was lo&s;t I know not how, and with it the very Remembrance of the Accident.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in the Year 1712, &s;ome Affairs of no great Con&s;equence calling me into the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI>, I re|turn'd about the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> from <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>, and taking no direct Road, came along by <HI>Henley</HI> and the woodie&s;t Part of <HI>Maidenhead</HI>-Thicket, where, for 12 or 14 Miles together, a Man can hardly &s;ee any other Wood but Beech.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that this very Year, the Beech-Ma&s;t grew in greater Plenty, than Ordinary, and as I rode among the Trees, I ob&s;erv'd that they were almo&s;t bow'd to the Ground with their Burthens, and hung ju&s;t as I had &s;een them twelve Years before in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI>; The Similitude of the two Objects at once brought back to my Remembrance the Experiment, I had then made, and I was immediately mov'd with Curio&s;ity to try, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beech-Nut might not yield an Oil, as &s;weet as the <HI>Neapolitan</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">At my Return to <HI>London</HI> I made the Experiment; I found it an&s;wer the utmo&s;t of my Expectations; and having by Enquiries of the Country People, before in|form'd my &s;elf, that there was no U&s;e for this Ma&s;t, but that all, which the Hogs left undevour'd, lay rotting on the Ground, and was look'd upon as not worth gather|ing; I made it my next Bu&s;ine&s;s to trace out the U&s;es of this new Oil.</P>
<P>I found it excellent in all Things, wherein it was try'd; The Perfumers valu'd it beyond the Oils they u&s;e, becau&s;e they &s;aid it had a &s;tronger Body; The A|pothecaries, to a Man, were po&s;itive that it was Oil of Almonds, and as good as ever they had ta&s;ted; The Clothiers declar'd, that a Pint of This was worth a Quart of &s;uch Oil, as they generally make u&s;e of, but that &s;o fine an Oil mu&s;t needs, they &s;aid, be &s;old at too great a Price for their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When I perceiv'd that the Oil was in it &s;elf thus excellent, I endeavour'd to find out what demand there might be for Oils in general, by applying my &s;elf to the &s;everal Dealers in That Commodity, and examining care|fully the Bills of Entry at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e; But I was &s;oon convinc'd that the Quantity of Oil con&s;um'd in <HI>England</HI>, was &s;o prodigious, that it was never likely to be glutted.</P>
<P>I had now but one doubt left to &s;atisfy, and that was, whether there was a Quantity of <HI>Ma&s;t</HI> in <HI>England</HI> to make a Trade of Beech-Oil, and &s;upply the <HI>Demand</HI>, which I found &s;o general; I knew well enough by the Experiments, I had made, that whatever Quantities of this Oil cou'd be got, wou'd in a Manner co&s;t nothing, but the Charge of procuring Ma&s;t, which I found by That, which I had got gather'd, cou'd never come to more in &s;uch a Year as That, than Three-pence or a Groat a Bu&s;hel; &s;o that it only remain'd to di&s;cover,
<PB N="38" REF="37">
whether Beech-Ma&s;t was as common, and as much neg|lected in other Counties of the Kingdom, as it was in tho&s;e Parts, which I &s;o lately pa&s;s'd through, of <HI>Berk|&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI>.</P>
<P>To this End I made &s;everal Journies on purpo&s;e, till I had &s;een the large&s;t Parts of two and twenty Coun|ties, in the lea&s;t of which I plainly found that there was Beech-Ma&s;t enough to &s;upply Oil, not to <HI>Eng|land</HI> only, but all the three Kingdoms three Times over.</P>
<P>Here, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I began to be amaz'd! Is it po&s;&s;ible, thought I, comparing all the foregoing Cir|cum&s;tances, that &s;uch a Di&s;covery as This, is now to be made? I &s;aw it a Reality, and yet cou'd &s;carce be|lieve it other than a Dream; &s;o va&s;t and &s;o infallible were the Profits of the Secret found; and &s;o unlikely and improb$ble but a Month or two before, &s;hou'd I have thought the Accident.</P>
<P>The only Difficulty now was. How to manage &s;uch an Undertaking; The Stock, I found by the mo&s;t mo|derate Computation, wou'd amount to a greater Sum than I cou'd rai&s;e; And the Arts of Trade I had Rea&s;on to believe were be&s;t known to People, who had made Trade their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I therefore propos'd the Affair to &s;uch Per&s;ons, as I thought mo&s;t likely to li&s;ten to the Of$er, and carry on the Bu&s;ine&s;s; I judg'd it prudent to conceal the Parti|culars, that is, I did not tell them, that I had found out that an Oil might be made of <HI>Beech-Ma&s;t</HI>, but I told them, that I cou'd make an Oil in great Quantity from a common Vegetable of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Growth, which wou'd be as good, or better for all U&s;es, than the <HI>Se|ville</HI>, or <HI>Gallipoli</HI> Oils, and yet not co&s;t a fourth Part of the Rates, which tho&s;e Oils went at; that I was ready to let them into a large Proportion of the Pro|fits,
<PB N="$$" REF="38">
if they wou'd rai&s;e a proper Stock, and that if they wou'd &s;ecure my Intere&s;t, by entering fir&s;t into a conditional Covenant, I wou'd make them Ma&s;ters of the Secret, and give them full Experience and Demon|&s;tration of the Fact, in whatever Manner, they &s;hou'd think mo&s;t &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>'Till now I was a Stranger to the Tempers of Man|kind, and expected to have heard Rea&s;on oppos'd again&s;t Rea&s;on, and that I &s;hou'd have been undeceiv'd my &s;elf, or have convinc'd others, by a natural Con&s;equence of Argument and Demon&s;tration; But I was ignorant it &s;eems, and did not know the World; Whim, Project, Impo&s;&s;ibility, Diving, Linen-Manufacture, Salt-Petre, Mine-Adventure, were the only Arguments I met with, and in whatever Corner of the City I propo&s;ed the Undertaking, in&s;tead of the Civility due to a Man, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was to make their Fortunes, I cou'd &s;carce have met with colder Treatment, had I come to borrow Mo|ney of them.</P>
<P>By this Time I di&s;cover'd plainly, that I was going the wrong Way to work; That Peoples invincible Aver|&s;ion to the word <HI>Project</HI>, wou'd never &s;uffer them to believe me, till I cou'd &s;peak what I had to &s;ay plainly, and it was dangerous to do That, till I had &s;ecur'd a Property in the Exerci&s;e of the Invention, by Vertue of a Patent from the Crown; which Kind of Patent, an Act of Parliament of the 21&s;t of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, has made valid, and lawful, again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition for fourteen Years.</P>

<P>The Books were open but a very few Days before this &s;econd Sum was al&s;o &s;ub&s;crib'd; and now the Stock which I had to work with, amounted to a Hundred and twenty thou&s;and Pounds, and the Per&s;ons concern'd in the Two Sub&s;criptions, though they both depended on the &s;ame general Bottom, had each a &s;everal differing Security, and their Intere&s;ts no way cla&s;h'd with one another.</P>

<P><PB N="47" REF="46">It was my next Care to provide a proper Work-Hou&s;e, for making &s;o much of the Oil as wou'd &s;upply the De|mand of <HI>London</HI> and its Neighbourhood, which is &s;o great, that the Soap-makers only within the Bills of Mor|tality, con&s;ume above &s;even thou&s;and Tons of Oil in one Year; It was long before I cou'd find a Place compleat|ly fit for this Bu&s;ine&s;s; At la&s;t I &s;ucceeded, and took a Lea&s;e of the long Brick Building at <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI>, which is commonly call'd the <HI>Gun-Hou&s;e</HI>, and which is the mo&s;t convenient Place in the World for &s;uch a De&s;ign, as it lies full upon the Water, that Barges from <HI>Berk&s;hire, Buckingham$hire</HI>, and <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI>, coming down the Ri|ver, may lie clo&s;e up to the Wall, and crane out the Ma&s;t into any Part of the Lofts, or the Work-Hou&s;e; And the Oil may by Means of &s;uch leathern Pipes, as the Brewers Men convey their Drink by into Ale-Hou&s;e-Cellars, be fill'd into Ve&s;&s;els, as they lie in the Barges, directly from the Ci&s;terns, without the lea&s;t Trouble of Landing and re-loading the Caskage:</P>
<P>Being thus &s;ecure of a Work-Hou&s;e, and &s;tore-Room enough, my next Care was, by what Method to proceed in making the Oil:</P>
<P>In order to inform my &s;elf in this particular, I vi&s;ited the Rape-Mills, and all other Places, where Oils of any Sort are made by Expre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;lik'd them all; The Way of Grinding down the Seed in the Mills, is by the circular Motion of a turning Grind&s;tone, &s;et Edgeways upon another, which lies flat, which Grind&s;tone, by pa&s;&s;ing &s;o often and &s;o &s;wiftly over the Seed, I found to heat it &s;o much in the Cru&s;hing, that it occa&s;ion'd an extraordinary Rankne&s;s in the Oil; And That Rankne&s;s is encreas'd by another Method they have of heating the broken Seed in an Iron Pan, before they pre&s;s it.</P>
<P>The Oil is then pre&s;s'd out by the Force of great wooden Beams, which being hung perpendicular, and
<PB N="48" REF="47">
lifted up to certain Heights by the Motion of a Water|wheel, fall down with a &s;mart Stroke, and &s;queeze out the Oil from a Bag, which is plac'd between two Wedges in a clo&s;e Pre&s;s, from whence the Oil drops down into a Copper Receiver.</P>
<P>'Tis worth your while, if you have never &s;een a Rape-Mill, to be curious enough to do it; You will then be pre&s;ently convinc'd, by ob&s;erving how much Oil the Rape-Seed yields, that 'tis no wonder there &s;hou'd be as much in the Beech-Ma&s;t; which, upon the Compari&s;on, Every Body will pre&s;ently perceive to be the Heavie&s;t, and mo&s;t Oily of the two Seeds, and in Proportion not near &s;o husky. There are many Rape-Mills about <HI>London</HI>; Particularly one at <HI>Wand&s;worth</HI>, ano|ther at <HI>Rotherhith</HI>, and a Third upon the Bank between <HI>We&s;t-Ham</HI> and <HI>Bromley</HI>.</P>
<P>To remedy the Defects, I ob&s;erv'd in the&s;e Mills, and avoid their Inconveniencies of frequent Repair, and often &s;tanding &s;till by too much Water, or too little, I re&s;olv'd upon a new Engine, capable of doing infinitely more work than the Mills, at a Quarter of their Expence both in Time and Money.</P>
<P>I caus'd one of The&s;e to be &s;et up at <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI>, where it now &s;tands, which is ea&s;ily manag'd by one Man's Labour, and will at lea&s;t make more Oil, than the be&s;t Mill in <HI>England</HI> can pretend to, with the Charge of great Rents, Repairs, and 3 or 4 Men to ma|nage it.</P>
<P>I had gone on to have improv'd this Engine, and en|larg'd it, as al&s;o to erect a great many more in the &s;ame Place, make Ci&s;terns, and fini&s;h all Things nece&s;&s;ary, which is not the Work of above &s;ix Weeks at longe&s;t, but I found it needle&s;s, for the Rea&s;ons, I &s;hall by and by ac|quaint you with.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48">I tire you perhaps with this tedious Account of Parti|culars, but I entreat you to have Patience; It will lead you gradually from one Proof to another, till you find your &s;elf fully convinc'd of the Greatne&s;s of this Di&s;co|very, and in&s;pir'd with a ju&s;t and generous Indignation again&s;t the Malice and Folly of &s;uch unthinking Men, who have endeavour'd to oppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>Having now prepar'd, and made &s;ure, whatever was fit to be fir&s;t done; I made it my next Care to become a perfect Ma&s;ter of all Things nece&s;&s;ary to be known, both at Home and Abroad, in order to the proper Manage|ment of the Affair in General.</P>
<P>I cho&s;e with the be&s;t Di&s;cretion I was Ma&s;ter of, and di&s;patch'd Agents on Purpo&s;e into mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Europe</HI>, procur'd Recommendatory Letters, and held as extended a Corre&s;pondence as po&s;&s;ible, for Information concerning the Quantities and Rates of Beech-Ma&s;t from beyond Sea; The Effect of The&s;e Endeavours you &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee, in as full a Manner as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider'd that the Counties, wherein the Woollen Manufactures are e&s;tabli&s;h'd, wou'd con&s;ume the greate&s;t Quantities of Beech-Oil; and that therefore it wou'd be very u&s;eful to &s;end into tho&s;e Counties, and procure a certain Information from the Dealers them&s;elves, what Quantities of Oil I might expect to &s;ell, and prepare to make it in Proportion to the Demand; For by the Con|tradictory Accounts, I receiv'd from Merchants, and Trade&s;men, of whom no Two were ever in one Story, I perceiv'd there cou'd be no Dependance on their Re|ports of Oil imported: And the Bills of Entry cou'd only inform me, How much Oil was brought to <HI>London</HI>, which is nothing to the whole Kingdom's Con&s;umption, becau&s;e the woollen Manufacture, which con&s;umes mo&s;t Oil, is lea&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Neighbourhood of that City.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49">Again, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end Samples of this Beech-Oil among the Dealers, that by making Trials in their &s;everal Ways, they might all experimentally become acquainted with its Virtues.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance of This Re&s;olution I &s;ent down able Agents, Men vers'd in the Nature, and the Forms of Bu&s;ine&s;s, into all &s;uch Parts of <HI>England</HI>, as I judg'd mo&s;t worth my while to corre&s;pond with; Every Man had his particular Road appointed him, and was to act and govern him&s;elf by &s;tated Rules; An Example of which I here give you in the Copy of one of their In|&s;tructions.</P>

<P>The Care and Diligence of the&s;e Agents &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that I had long ago a Li&s;t of Dealers in Oil, and their Orders to &s;end down above two and twenty thou&s;and Tons of Beech-Oil, to ready-Money Cu&s;to|mers, at 40 <HI>l.</HI> a Ton, which amounts to almo&s;t a Mil|lion of Money Sterling in one Years Time, by Means of a Di&s;covery, which People are all the while making merry with, and looking upon, as a Project, and an emp|ty Notion.</P>
<P>This will I know be &s;trange News to many hone&s;t Gentlemen, who judge of publick Con&s;umption by their own private Dealings; But I am not here affirming Things upon Imagination, but Experience, and unde|niable Demon&s;tration; I have the Names, Places of Abode, and Quantity con&s;um'd yearly, of almo&s;t every noted Dealer in Oil in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire you to believe nothing but what you &s;ee prov'd; 'Twou'd require a Volume to in&s;ert here the whole Account; I will therefore only make U&s;e of the Northern Con&s;umption, becau&s;e in That Part of the Kingdom every Body knows, that the Demand for Oil bears no Proportion to That of other Places.</P>
<P>The following Letters from my Northern Agent, as he made his Journey, will &s;hew you a Con&s;umption of above Two Thou&s;and Tons a Year, in a Corner of the Land, where very few Merchants think there is any Oil us'd at all; and which I therefore chu&s;e to give you as an Example.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;IT is now high Time to give you an Account of my Travels to This Place; where the Concern I was under, when I left the good Family I was before en|gaged in, was alleviated by the kind Reception of your new Agent and Undertaking. All the eminent Merchants both at <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Leeds</HI>, have an entire good Opinion of its Succe&s;s, and have promis'd to pro|mote it; tho' I think it will not need their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; Your Letter to Mr. Mayor of <HI>Leeds</HI> was very kindly receiv'd; He promis'd he wou'd write to you; and has already given me ju&s;t Proofs of his good Intentions, by acquainting, and explaining to the Aldermen, Mer|chants, Clothiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Profit and U&s;efulne&s;s of the Invention; At the Market, which is every Tue&s;day and Saturday, Mr. Mayor in Per&s;on recommended your Oil to the Dealers in that Commodity You are much oblig'd to Him, Alderman <HI>A&s;cough</HI>, and indeed the whole Town, for their Extraordinary Civility; All the Oil-Men will take Quantities, and pay ready Money: The Con&s;umption of Oil in the two Towns of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Leeds</HI> only, amounts to upwards of a thou&s;and Ton a Year; But if you can &s;end them four or five hundred Tons, it may &s;top their Mouths for a while; Rape-&s;eed Oil is now at two Shillings and Eight-pence a Gallon, and has been at three Shillings and Ten-pence; <HI>Seville</HI> Oil, which has been at &s;ix Shillings, is now at four Shillings and Four-pence; I am &s;ure, when yours comes, They will u&s;e none el&s;e; The Growers of Rape look amaz'd; And the Drawers of Oil, will &s;hortly put their Mill-Sails into deep Mourn|&endq;ing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Plea&s;e to repleni&s;h my Stock of Beech-Oil; I &s;hou'd I think have had a Hog&s;head &s;et in the Middle of the Market, with two or three hundred Spoons for the Country Clothiers to ta&s;te with; They have try'd and
<PB N="54" REF="53">
lick'd away my little Cargo; But I may &s;ay This to my Comfort, that I have never yet met one Mar$ &endq;who pretended to di&s;like it; I conclude,</Q></P>

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;I Staid a whole Week in <HI>York</HI>, and found it the propere&s;t Time in the World to propagate your Affair. I had every Day Occa&s;ion to expo&s;e your Oil to the be&s;t Judges in the North. Mr. <HI>Bell</HI>, the Chymi&s;t, has by a full Experiment found yours to excel any Oil, that can be u&s;ed for the Woollen Manufacture. It continues to plea&s;e every Dealer; in&s;omuch that no Body will lay
<PB N="63" REF="62">
up Quantities for longer than the Time, when they ex|&endq;pect yours to be ready.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Con&s;umption of Oil to this Place amounts to Eighteen hundred and eighty &s;even Tons and two Hog&s;heads, in the Hands of &s;ub&s;tantial and ready-money Cu&s;tomers, who will pay upon Delivery. I hope to fini&s;h my Jour|&endq;ney in a few Weeks more; and am,</Q></P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your</HI>, &amp;c. Robt. Ibbot&s;on.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I take up too much Room, and am forced to break off without in&s;erting the remaining Accounts, which make the total Amount of even this Northern Circuit above two Thou&s;and Tons of Oil <HI>per Annum</HI>.</P>
<P>I add here a few Letters from <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devon|&s;hire</HI>, which &s;hall end this Part of the Proof, being far more than is nece&s;&s;ary to the Point in Que&s;tion.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;I Have &s;ince my la&s;t had Opportunity of meeting at one Time a whole knot of Woolcombers, and I find they are all overjoy'd at &s;o good an Oil; the Want of &s;weet Oil having always been a great Damage to their &endq;Bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;They are all of one Mind; and all, who try your Beech-Oil, as mo&s;t of them do before they &s;peak their Mind, a&s;&s;ure me, that they never &s;aw &s;o good, and &s;o fat &endq;an Oil, as this is.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="63">
<Q>&startq;I am &s;ure, that if I had a Thou&s;and Tons, I could &s;ell &endq;it all ju&s;t now here in <HI>Cornwall</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I &s;end you the Particulars hitherto, and &s;hall continue to do &s;o as I go on. But I find that in general every Workman, who combs Wool for Serge, u&s;es one with &endq;another a Hog&s;head in a Year.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I have already, as you will &s;ee, taken an Account of more than Four thou&s;and &s;uch Workmen in this Part of the County; &s;o that That amounts to a Thou&s;and Tons of Oil a Year; which, if you remember, was more than &endq;you thought us'd in <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Price now given is four Shillings and ten Pence the Gallon. It has been bought for three Shillings &endq;twenty Years ago. I &s;hall next Week, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I am,</Q></P>

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;MY la&s;t from <HI>Exeter</HI> carried you a particular Ac|count to that Place. You &s;hall have a compleat Li&s;t of the <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Con&s;umption on this Side in a &endq;Po&s;t or Two.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The exacte&s;t general Information I can now &s;end you is, that I have an Account of Forty Thou&s;and Wool-workers, who, allowing them but to u&s;e a Barrel a-piece, which is far &s;hort, as you have &s;een by the Particulars, of what they really do con&s;ume, require a Supply of
<PB N="65" REF="64">
five Thou&s;and Tons of Oil a Year for <HI>Cornwall</HI>, and about two Thirds of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>, which I have already &endq;travers'd according to In&s;tructions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As Oils now go in the&s;e Parts, Beech-Oil may pick and chu&s;e Cu&s;tom at Five and forty Pound a Ton; and as Five thou&s;and Tons at that Price amount to Two hundred and twenty five thou&s;and Pounds, be plea&s;ed to let me know, if you &s;till hold it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould, after fini&s;hing this County, go on to <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI>. &endq;I am,</Q></P>

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;I AM at la&s;t got home; and with the more Satisfa|ction to my &s;elf, becau&s;e you &s;eem plea&s;ed with my &endq;Endeavours for your Service.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I enclo&s;e the compleat Account; and have nothing to add, but that the Clothiers every where complain, that the Merchants, of late Years, have not been able to &s;up|ply them with Oil &s;ufficient for their Occa&s;ions; and that their Goods have not been &s;o well wrought, as they had been, had they had Plenty of good Oil to work their Wooll with; &s;o that they will u&s;e even more than the Account mentions, when they find they can have it &endq;&s;o ea&s;ily.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I will ob&s;erve your Orders as to the Beech-Ma&s;t: But the Blite has made it &s;o much more trouble&s;om to get it good, than it is in other Years, that I much fear I &s;hall
<PB N="66" REF="65">
not be able to bargain for any con&s;iderable Quantity &endq;cheaper than Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel.</Q></P>
<P>'<HI>Will. Barnes</HI> and the re&s;t expect Earne&s;t, which pray '&s;end me word if I &s;hall give at that Rate. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your</HI>, &amp;c. Tho. Smyth.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>By this Time you are, I hope, convinc'd, that the Beech-Oil can never want a Market; and it only remains to demon&s;trate, that it is as much impo&s;&s;ible for the Mar|ket to want Beech-Oil.</P>
<P>But now to return to the Thread of my De&s;ign, when I perceiv'd by the Accounts my Agents &s;ent me from eve|ry Part of the Kingdom, what prodigious Quantities of Oil might be di&s;pos'd of; how much the Dealers preferr'd Beech-Oil to any other; and that the Commodity would at all Times command ready Money, and might pick and chu&s;e its Cu&s;tomers, I thought it high Time to take care of the Beech-Ma&s;t.</P>
<P>I was willing to obtain as particular Accounts, as to a Supply of Ma&s;t, as I had received of the Demand for Oil; and therefore, being re&s;olv'd to &s;pare no Co&s;t or Labour, I di&s;patch'd at one time new Agents into Six and thirty Coun$ies, out of the Two and fifty, be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;ent into foreign Parts before.</P>
<P>Their Bu&s;ine&s;s you will be&s;t comprehend by the follow|ing In&s;tructions.</P>

<HEAD>In&s;tructions for Mr. <HI>William Cro&s;s,</HI> in a Journey for Procuration of <HI>Beech-Ma&s;t,</HI> through the Counties of <HI>Dor&s;et, Somer&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Wilts</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>'YOU begin your Journey from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>'Cran|burn</HI>.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;At <HI>Cranburn</HI> begin your Enquiries, not only from Gentlemen with whom you are acquainted, or to whom you can procure recommendatory Letters, but al&s;o from all Inn-keepers, Travellers, Country-men, or others, in|&endq;to who&s;e Company you &s;hall accidentally fall.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Whatever An&s;wers you receive to any Que&s;tions, or whatever Bargains you make, or Informations you get, in relation to the Affair you go about, you mu&s;t enter as particularly as po&s;&s;ible in a Paper-Book, by way of Journal, with an Account of the Place where, the Time when, the Per&s;ons who, and all other Circum|&endq;&s;tances daily occurring.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Que&s;tions to be ask'd are &s;uch as the&s;e: What Quantity of Beech grows thereabouts? To whom it belongs? And whether they know of any People who have ever gather'd Beech-Ma&s;t? How much clear from the Husk they have been able to gather from one Tree? How many Bu&s;hels one Per&s;on's Labour could procure in one Day? What Wages they expect <HI>per</HI> Day in tho&s;e Parts? And what Method in gathering the Ma&s;t they &endq;generally make u&s;e of?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67">
<Q>&startq;When you have ask'd all the&s;e Que&s;tions, and re|ceived and &s;et down their &s;everal An&s;wers, you mu&s;t deliver to the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, three, &s;ix, or more, as they think fit, of the Printed Bills, and de&s;ire that if they &s;hould accidentally meet with any Gentlemen who own Ma&s;t, or Farmers, or poor People who would gather it, and have heard nothing of the&s;e Bills, that they would tell them all the Particulars, and give them Directions where to &s;end Notice of any Quantity of Ma&s;t they &s;hall get, and encourage them as much as they can, to gather all they are able to find, and to u&s;e the Method of ga|&endq;thering which is &s;et down in the printed Bills.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;If you meet with any Gentlemen who have Parks or Woods of their own, full of Ma&s;t, but do not care for the Trouble of gathering it at their own Charge, you may let them know, that if they will &s;uffer poor People to gather their Ma&s;t without Interrupt$on, and order a Servant to take Account of what Quantity is gather'd, and in who&s;e Hands it lies, you will call at their Hou&s;e &s;ome Time in <HI>October</HI>, and pay them down two Pence a Bu&s;hel for all the Ma&s;t which has been gather'd from their Trees, and which their above-named Servant &s;hall go with you, and help you to, from the Country-People &endq;who gather'd it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to per&s;wade the Country-Gentlemen them&s;elves to employ the poor People, and gather their own Ma&s;t: And in order thereto, make them &s;en&s;ible how great a Benefit they will do in their Neigh|bourhood; and that if they take the Method of gather|ing de&s;cribed in the B$l$s, by &s;preading Things under the Boughs, and &s;haking the Branches with a Hook upon the Pole, they cannot fall at the Price propo&s;ed, to get at lea&s;t half clear Profit. To this End, per&s;wade them on|ly to try one Day, when their Ma&s;t is full ripe, and by comparing the Quantity which &s;hall be gather'd that Day, with the Wages which they pay to the Gatherers, they

will pre&s;ently be at a Certainty for a trifling Charge, and &endq;may go on, or not, as they find it will an&s;wer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Wherever you &s;ee any &s;traggling Beech-Trees full of Ma&s;t, on or near the High-way, or el&s;ewhere, though never &s;o few, you may call at the next Cottage, or poor Man's Hou&s;e you come to, and engage him to gather it when it is ripe, as the Bills will in&s;truct him, and to keep it where it may lie dry; and let him know that you will be with him &s;ome Time in <HI>October</HI>, to &s;ee what Quantity he has got, and pay him the propos'd Price for every Bu&s;hel, that is clean and free from Leaves, Husks, Sticks, or other Foulne&s;s: And Before you leave him, &s;et down his Name, and Place of Abode, that you may not for|get how to find him, and leave with him &s;ome Bills to di&s;per&s;e among &s;uch of his Acquaintance who know of any Ma&s;t, and &s;hall be willing to gather it upon the &s;ame Terms; de&s;iring him, if he finds any &s;uch, to tell you when you come next, who they are, and where they live, that you may call and pay them for the Ma&s;t &endq;they &s;hall have gather'd.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="$9" REF="88">
<Q>&startq;Here, about <HI>Paris</HI>, we have no Beech-Woods, that is to &s;ay, none which con&s;i&s;t entirely of that Species; Tho' we have them, and that va&s;tly large, and no le&s;s frequent, in our neighbouring Woods, about <HI>Meudon, Ver&s;ailles, St. Germain, Mont-Morency, Fountainbleau</HI>, and many other Places, within a Day's Journey round us: But almo&s;t every where on the River <HI>Loire</HI>, and particularly, in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Orleans</HI>, there are whole, and huge Fore&s;ts of this Kind: The <HI>Garonne</HI> is border'd with them, even as low as <HI>Bourdeaux</HI>, nor are they wanting on the <HI>Somme</HI>; Indeed I know no &endq;Wood &s;o common as the Beech in all this Country.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;They ripen, here with us, about the Beginning of this Month, but do not ea&s;ily, nor without much &s;hak|ing, quit their Husks, till after a &s;evere Fro&s;t or two; I have ob&s;erv'd them hanging upon &s;ome Trees till near <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>. When they fall, they lie in mo&s;t Places an Inch or two thick, but the Deer, where-ever they can &endq;come at the Store, are &s;ure to le&s;&s;en it a-pace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I cannot &s;o particularly inform you, as to the Price, for which they may be gather'd, but to come as near a Certainty as I cou'd, being la&s;t Week with <HI>T&mdash; B</HI>&mdash; at <HI>Mont-Morency</HI>, I employ'd a Pea&s;ant for a whole Afternoon, to &s;pread a Parcel of Blankets under the Beeches, behind his Stable, and &s;hake down all he cou'd; And at Night he mea&s;ur'd out eleven Bu&s;hels; According to which Quantity, if we reckon, that a Man who begins to work in the Morning, may &s;hake down twenty Bu&s;hels a Day, I cannot &s;ee they will come to &endq;much above a Farthing a Bu&s;hel.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;We have, <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI>, in every Part of <HI>France</HI>, too much of this Beech, you write about; Towards the <HI>Pyrenees</HI> it harbours Wolves in Numbers, hurtful to the Husbandry of the Neighbourhood; Our Northern Pro|vinces have now for near an Age made better U&s;e of the &s;ame Woods in &s;maller Quantity; For they have in many Places no Oil, but what the Beech-Ma&s;t yields them, and which is indeed &s;o excellent, that many of our Courtly Ta&s;ts begin to envy the Beech-Oil of our Pea&s;ants, and prefer it to the choice&s;t Product of our &endq;Olives.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But nothing moves my wonder &s;o much as that this Art &s;hould be, till now, a Secret in your Country, when it is the mo&s;t publick Thing in the World in that Part of ours, which is neare&s;t to you; I am the more amaz'd, becau&s;e at the Time, when I receiv'd your Letter, I was &s;itting in my Study, and remembring &s;uch a Thing, I pre&s;ently laid my Hand on a Book, which was tran&s;lated out of your Language not above twenty Years ago, and was dedicated to the <HI>Roya$-Society</HI> of <HI>London</HI>; 'Twas publi&s;h'd by the Sieur <HI>Je$n Evelyn</HI>, and is call'd a Di&s;|cour&s;e of Fore&s;t-Trees; This very Author in a particu|lar Chapter upon the <HI>Beech-T$ee</HI>, &s;ays expre&s;ly, that the Beech-Ma&s;t yields a very &s;weet Oil, which the Pea&s;ants of <HI>France</HI> pre&s;s out in Mills, and eat with much Satisfaction; your I&s;land is indeed po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of

<P><Q>&startq;In <HI>Bretagne</HI>, and the Provinces where they make this Oil of Beech-Ma&s;t, their Ma&s;t is gather'd and brought to the Mills by Country People for a <HI>Piece de cinq Sons</HI> (five Pence) <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel. The Millers will grind any Man's Ma&s;t, and make it into Oil, for a Penny a Bu&s;hel over and above the Ma&s;t-Cakes, which they give to Cat|tle. I cannot remember what exact Quantity of Oil they expect from every Bu&s;hel of Ma&s;t; but I am &s;ure it is more than they get from the &s;ame Quantity of Rape-Seed; which la&s;t Seed is therefore grown out of U&s;e in &endq;tho&s;e Places.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I know not how to an&s;wer your Que&s;tion of what Price it bears hereabouts.

But I can in general a&s;&s;ure you, that if Plenty creates Cheapne&s;s, you may buy it in the&s;e Parts &endq;for what you plea&s;e to offer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Three Fore&s;ts of <HI>Blois, Chambours</HI>, and <HI>Orleans</HI>, are full of Beech Wood for above Two hundred Miles together.

<P><PB N="93" REF="92">Every &s;illy Story gives Alarum to the Apprehen&s;ions of the Multitude. To Day they <HI>confide</HI>, to Morrow they <HI>de&s;pair</HI>; and 'twere a plea&s;ant Speculation for a Per&s;on unconcern'd, to &s;tand by and ob&s;erve this ince&s;&s;ant Ro|tation of un&s;ettled Fancies.</P>
<P>Nor, is this all. A Man who &s;ucceeds in an Affair like mine, and enjoys in a manner all the Profit him&s;elf, is made the common Butt, the &s;hooting Mark of Envy and Malice. The World is apt to think his Merit over-paid by his good Fortune; and they never fail to take the &s;ure&s;t Means they can to mortify his Vanity.</P>
<P>All this I experienc'd in the &s;evere&s;t Manner; and all this I de&s;pis'd. I look'd down with a due Contempt up|on the unmanly Efforts of defaming Talkers, and con|&s;ider'd with much Concern, but little Anger, that they had not learn'd to make <HI>what they would be willing to &s;uf|fer</HI>, the Rule and Mea&s;ure of <HI>what they re&s;olve to do</HI>.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I grew weary of long re|ceiving and forgiving the &s;ame repeated Injuries; and re&s;olv'd to u&s;e the faire&s;t and mo&s;t likely Means I could think of to put an End to the Cau&s;e from whence they took their Ri&s;e.</P>
<P>A lucky Opportunity threw it &s;elf in my Way. The Year, by the un&s;ea&s;onable Drought, and a &s;evere Blite at|tending it, was, as you have &s;een by the Journals, very unfavourable to the Beech-Trees: The Ma&s;t was nipp'd in the Bud, and mo&s;t of it &s;poil'd. Even that which e&s;cap'd, of which enough however might ea&s;ily have been got to &s;upply more Beech-Oil than would have made good my Articles, was lighter and le&s;s only than in good Sea|&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93">The Accident immediately allarm'd the Sub&s;cribers. They became apprehen&s;ive that their Money was in Dan|ger; and comparing this Di&s;appointment in the Sea&s;on with the Rumours of the Town, they ra&s;hly grew jea|lous of Succe&s;s, and became almo&s;t univer&s;ally unea&s;y.</P>
<P>To as many of them as openly declar'd their Appre|hen&s;ions, I made plain their Mi&s;take: I blam'd them for their Un&s;teddine&s;s: I repre&s;ented to them, that though the Blite had damaged the Ma&s;t, and much le&s;&s;en'd the Quantity, yet there was more than enough to be got to do my Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I illu&s;trated this by the Example of <HI>Apple-Trees</HI>, which every Body knows to <HI>fail</HI> three or four times for once that they <HI>bear well</HI>; and that even in the wor&s;t Years, &s;ome Parts of the Kingdom have great Store of Apples: So the <HI>Beech-Ma&s;t</HI>, though blited in the general, is not|with&s;tanding very good in many particular Places.</P>
<P>I went on, and urg'd, that as no Body would pretend that a Man could get nothing by the <HI>Cider-Trade</HI>, becau&s;e there are four <HI>&s;carce</HI> Apple-Years to one <HI>plentiful</HI> one, &s;o it would be more unju&s;t to pretend, that the <HI>Beech-Oil-Trade</HI> mu&s;t come to nothing by rea&s;on of a bad Year or two, Becau&s;e a good Year for <HI>Beech-Ma&s;t</HI> mu&s;t as infal|libly come as a good Year for <HI>Apples</HI>; and when it does come, the Patent &s;ecures the whole Benefit of the Beech-Oil to it Proprietors; whereas the Cider-Trade lies open, and has many Thou&s;and Rival-Sharers to divide and le&s;&s;en its Profits, which are not in them&s;elves a tenth Part &s;o con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>I further informed them, That I did by no means depend wholly upon the <HI>Engli&s;h Ma&s;t</HI>; but that I had &s;ent many Agents abroad, and had contracted with &s;eve|ral Merchants for great Quantities of Beech-Ma&s;t, from <HI>France, Germany</HI>, and other Places; and particularly with
<PB N="95" REF="94">
Mr. <HI>Adrian Gulder&s;tein</HI>, for Two hundred thou&s;and Bu&s;hels from the <HI>Ducal Hol&s;tein</HI>.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other Arguments I us'd to convince them, That their Security was infallible, and they ought in Rea&s;on to di&s;tingui&s;h that it was &s;o: But however I re&s;olv'd at once to put an End to all their Doubts. If other People would not &s;ee their own Advantage, that was no Rea&s;on why I &s;hould be blind to mine: I there|fore writ a Letter to the following purpo&s;e, and &s;ent it to every particular Sub&s;criber, both upon the fir&s;t Propo|&s;al and the &s;econd.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I told them, that <HI>Michaelmas</HI> drawing nigh, I thought it proper to put them in mind, that if they did not pay in the la&s;t Part of their Sub&s;cription-Money, the fir&s;t Part, which they had paid in already, would by the Ar|&endq;ticles they &s;ub&s;crib'd to become forfeited.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But that, notwith&s;tanding this Article of Forfeiture, I would be &s;o far from in&s;i&s;ting on the Advantage, That if any of them were in the lea&s;t unea&s;y, they were free|&endq;ly and entirely at Liberty to withdraw their Sub&s;crip|tion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;And to encourage them to withdraw, They &s;hould not only be paid back all the Money they had advanc'd, but a clear Profit of Twenty five <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon it; that is, I would pay them a Hundred and twenty five Pounds &endq;for every Hundred Pounds receiv'd from them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I therefore gave them ten Days Time for Con&s;idera|tion, and de&s;ired them to choo&s;e freely, and either pay in the re&s;t of their Money by the Time fix'd, or give Notice at the Office, that they would quit the Sub|&endq;&s;cription upon the Conditions which I offer'd them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="95">The Sub&s;cribers upon the la&s;t Propo&s;al, to a Man, accep|ted my Offer; and the Rea&s;on they gave me for &s;o doing was this, That there was likely to be no great Quantity of Ma&s;t this Year, and that therefore they believed my fir&s;t Stock would be &s;ufficient. That the Succe&s;s of my Affair was very probable; but that &s;ince I had been &s;o generous to make them &s;uch an unexpected Offer, they could not but believe I had my Intere&s;t in &s;o doing; and they thought they &s;hould act mo&s;t wi&s;ely by accepting it, &s;ince it was no contemptible Gain to clear Twenty five <HI>per Cent.</HI> and to have been le&s;s than Six Months out of their Money.</P>
<P>I paid them back their Sub&s;cription, and the Profit upon it, with a much greater Plea&s;ure than they receiv'd it from me. But the Sub&s;cribers to the Fir&s;t Stock of Twenty thou&s;and Pounds were divided in their Senti|ments; and tho&s;e in the Li&s;t, which you will &s;ee in&s;erted in another Part of this Book, would upon no Con&s;idera|rations whatever be induced to part with their Right in the Sub&s;cription, and &s;till remain entitled to their An|nuities.</P>
<P>I now with a great deal of Plea&s;ure look'd back upon what I had done. I had reduc'd my Stock from a Hun|dred and twenty thou&s;and Pounds to Fifteen thou&s;and on|ly, and had drawn my Bu&s;ine&s;s into a very narrow Com|pa&s;s.</P>
<P>I had every Day great Sums of Money offer'd me, but I di&s;lik'd the Conditions, though they were indeed much ea&s;ier than tho&s;e I had &s;o luckily di&s;&s;olv'd. I found the Blite had &s;o far damag'd the Ma&s;t in <HI>England</HI>, that I ra|ther cho&s;e to depend on my Foreign Pro&s;pect for the little Quantity I &s;hould now want, and therefore recall'd my Agents, put a Stop to the Engines and other Works I was beginning at <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI>, and many other Places in the Country, and thought it more prudent to wait another
<PB N="97" REF="96">
Year before I put the Bu&s;ine&s;s to its utmo&s;t Stretch, be|cau&s;e the Ma&s;t, which is almo&s;t the only Expence, will then be both as cheap again, and as good again toge|ther.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t, the univer&s;al Opinion of my Friends, and my own Rea&s;on concurr'd, in a Re&s;olution, That it was, upon many Accounts, a fitter Work for a Bo|dy of Men than any &s;ingle Per&s;on; and that by &s;uch a Method of carrying it on as I have now determin'd to proceed by, the general Advantage of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and my own particular Profit and Ea&s;e, might be very well reconcil'd, and promote each other.</P>
<P>This therefore is the Cau&s;e to which you owe the Op|portunity of this new Propo&s;al. The Propo&s;al it &s;elf you have at large in the next Divi&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>A NEW PROPOSAL For E&s;tabli&s;hing a BEECH-OIL COMPANY, AND Dividing the Power and Profit of the <HI>PATENT</HI> into Shares.</HEAD>
<P>_I WILL endeavour to de&s;cribe what I mean di&s;tinctly, and &s;peak as plain as I can, that I may be rightly under&s;tood by my Readers.</P>
<P>Never before was &s;o great and &s;o &s;ecure a Profit given for &s;uch a trifling Con&s;ideration, as will be here demand|ed. My De&s;ign is not a Gain to my &s;elf, but a certain Foundation for the Undertaking I am going on with; and the only pre&s;ent Benefit I &s;eek to make, will be found upon Examination little more than a rea&s;onable Re|imbur&s;ement of my Charges.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="98">The &s;malle&s;t Sum for which any Body can be concern'd in this Propo&s;al, is Five and forty Pound, &s;even Shillings, and &s;ix Pence. If you part with this Forty five Pounds, odd Shillings, it cannot fail, within the Year, to make you a clear Profit of at lea&s;t Two hundred. If you make not the Profit, you part not with the Money. And if you will be timorous enough to fancy Impo&s;&s;ibilities, and &s;up|po&s;e that the whole Affair &s;hould come to nothing, even in That Ca&s;e you cannot lo&s;e above the odd Five Guineas.</P>
<P>The Greatne&s;s of the Stock, which is Two hundred thou|&s;and Pounds, will ari&s;e from the Number of the Sharers, and not the Dearne&s;s of the Shares. Every Part of the De&s;ign &s;hall be made plain to your Apprehen&s;ion in the Pages following. All I intend here is only to let you know the Bottom upon which you are to &s;tand, if you come into the Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>A Book is now open, every Day, at the Beech-Oil Office, at the <HI>Golden-Key</HI>, a Woollen-Draper's, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-yard, from Nine in the Morning till Twelve, and from Two till Five in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>This Book contains Five thou&s;and In&s;truments, which I call Shares. The&s;e In&s;truments are &s;ign'd by my Hand; and every Body who purcha&s;es one or more of them, be|comes entitled to one or more Shares in the whole Benefit and Power of the Patent.</P>
<P>The Price of every one of the&s;e Shares is Forty five Pounds, &s;even Shillings, and &s;ix Pence; that is to &s;ay, Forty five Pounds, &s;even Shillings, and &s;ix Pence, is the whole Sum which any Body can be obliged to pay in up|on one Share from fir&s;t to la&s;t: Out of all which, I am to have, in Con&s;ideration and Reimbur&s;ement of all pa&s;t Charges, Trouble and Fatigue whatever, no more than the odd Five Guineas: The other Forty Pound <HI>per</HI> Share is to be the Stock to carry on the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Sharers
<PB N="100" REF="99">
them&s;elves are to rai&s;e it, and di&s;po&s;e of it as they &s;ee Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>So that the downright Fact is no more than this: You pay Five Guineas for being let into a certain Means of making Two hundred Pounds a Year by laying out Forty. Ob&s;erve but what you read, and you &s;hall &s;ee this made as plain and demon&s;trable as you think it prodigious.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, &s;uch a Profit as This was never heard of before. I allow it was not; neither was there ever be|fore &s;o good a Foundation to build it upon.</P>
<P>When you have paid this Five Guineas for your Share, the other Forty Pounds will remain in your own Hands.</P>
<P>Out of this Forty Pounds the only dead Payment will be Fifteen Shillings every half Year, for the Annuities hereafter mentioned, which &s;till &s;tand charged upon the Patent. All other Expences will be for carrying on the Bu&s;ine&s;s, as is found nece&s;&s;ary by Five and twenty Directors of your own choo&s;ing.</P>
<P>The&s;e Directors are obliged to account for the Profits once a Year, or oftner; and when the Dividends are made, your Charge is fir&s;t to be reimbur&s;ed you, after which One twentieth Part of the clear Gain is to be de|ducted for my U&s;e, in Con&s;ideration of the Power and Advantages I give you, and then the Remainder is divided among you all in Proportion to your &s;everal Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Your Money mu&s;t be rai&s;ed by a publick Order of your Directors, and by different Payments, &s;ometimes Twenty Shillings, &s;ometimes Fifty, &s;ometimes more, as Occa&s;ion may require, and the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted with as much Ea&s;e and Security to the Sharers as is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But you will better apprehend the De&s;ign by the fol|lowing Extract of the Deed and Schedules, by which

<HEAD>A Di&s;cour&s;e explaining the Advantages of This <HI>Propo&s;al</HI> to the Per&s;ons concern'd.</HEAD>
<P>I Will under this Head be as brief as po&s;&s;ible, for I have no Occa&s;ion to &s;ay much upon a Subject, which to every Thinking Reader, will explain it &s;elf.</P>
<P>If you con&s;ider the <HI>Profit</HI>, it is prodigious; If you think upon the <HI>Sum</HI> you <HI>venture</HI>, to entitle your &s;elf to this Profit; It is &s;carce worth naming.</P>
<P>The foregoing Proofs mu&s;t convince any Man of com|mon Sen&s;e, that Beech-Ma&s;t can never co&s;t the <HI>Company</HI>, Even reckoning Carriage and all, &s;o much as Six-pence a Bu&s;hel, or indeed any Thing near it, as I &s;hall hereafter make more plain to your Directors, when I di&s;cover ma|ny Steps, which by the Experience, I have had in the Affair, &s;eem propere&s;t to be taken.</P>
<P>All other Charges, with Mills, Engines, Salaries, and every Thing, which can be thought upon, will fall infi|nitely &s;hort of another Six-pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel; &s;o that what|ever Oil a Bu&s;hel of Beech-Ma&s;t yields, can &s;tand the <HI>Company</HI> but in one Shilling.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then that you have only &s;ix Quarts from a Bu&s;hel, and that you &s;ell, at the very lowe&s;t Price, Even no dearer than &s;tinking Rape-Oil, that is, at three Shil|lings a Gallon; At This Rate, which, both as to Pro|duce and Price of the Oil, is far below what can ever happen, Every &s;harer will make a clear Profit of 400 <HI>l. per Cent, per Annum</HI>, upon whatever Money he employs in the Undertaking.</P>
<P>Nay, you may fairly reckon all the Money the Oil &s;ells for, to be clear Profit, &s;ince I have experienc'd and will di&s;cover to the Company, that the very refu&s;e Ma&s;t-Cakes, which are left after pre&s;&s;ing out the Oil, will &s;ell for more Profit, than the whole Charge of the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="108">Neither is it an Objection to &s;ay, that the Beech-Ma&s;t hits well only one Year in three, &s;ince be&s;ides that you may in bad Years be furni&s;h'd cheaply from beyond-Sea, you may gather Ma&s;t enough in <HI>England</HI>, in one good Year, to &s;upply the Trade, till another good Year hap|pens, tho' they &s;hou'd be &s;even Years a&s;under.</P>
<P>I have taken Lea&s;es of &s;ome of the be&s;t Beech-Parks in <HI>England</HI>, any one of which, in &s;uch a Year as this next is expected to prove, will almo&s;t &s;upply Ma&s;t enough for the whole Kingdom; The Rents are very ea&s;y, and the Bargains &s;hall hereafter be apply'd to the Service of the <HI>Company</HI>.</P>
<P>Let us however &s;et a&s;ide the Profit to be made by the <HI>Ma&s;t-Cakes</HI>, and only reckon upon the 400 <HI>per Cent</HI>, which is a Gain, that I defy all Mankind to &s;hew a Rea|&s;on, for not depending on.</P>
<P>At this Rate, Examine the Advantages you become entitled to by buying one Share only.</P>
<P>You come to the Office at the <HI>Golden Key</HI> in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-yard</HI>, and pay down for your Share five Guinea's.</P>
<P>This five Guinea's is all you hazard; You cannot po&s;|&s;ibly lo&s;e a Farthing more; For admit that all the unde|niable Demon&s;tration of this Bu&s;ine&s;s were a meer Dream, a Shadow, a <HI>Chimaera</HI>, a Thing of nothing; Yet even &s;o, you can lo&s;e no more than that little Sum, for the fol|lowing Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>No more Money is to be paid, or can be demanded, till your Directors are cho&s;en, and &s;ee fit to call it in by &s;uch &s;everal Payments, as they find nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is naturally to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that You, and every other Per&s;on concerned, will take Care to give your Vote for none but Men, who&s;e Honour, Character, and Capa|city you are very well acquainted with.</P>
<P>When four and twenty &s;uch Men are join'd with me, They have four and twenty Times my Power in the Ma|nagement of the Affair; and will, naturally, both for their Reputation and their Intere&s;t, take proper Mea&s;ures, fully to acquaint them&s;elves with the Nature of it and i&s;&s;ue no Orders but what &s;hall be apparently conducive to the general Benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="109">You cannot be impo&s;ed upon by any fal&s;e Pretences; For all Orders for rai&s;ing Money, and the Cau&s;es for which they require it, are enter'd, and lie publick for your looking into, and your Directors are oblig'd, at the End of their Year, to give you an Account, and demon|&s;trate that they have apply'd your Money, as your &s;elves de&s;ign'd it.</P>
<P>Were the next Year, in&s;tead of a <HI>Good</HI>, to prove a <HI>bad</HI> one, all the Money, which you cou'd po&s;&s;ibly be liable to pay, wou'd be Thirty Shillings for the Annuities, and a much &s;maller Sum for Salaries, Agencies, and all the &s;tanding Charges of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o that if you were to be <HI>Getting</HI> nothing, you wou'd, in a manner, be <HI>Pay|ing</HI> nothing neither.</P>
<P>But as it is a Kind of Infallibility, that next Year will prove, as every Third Year does, a Year of Plenty, &s;o 'tis likely, that within the fir&s;t twelve Months, your Di|rectors will find it Nece&s;&s;ary, to call in all, or the great|e&s;t Part of your Forty Pounds, to pay for Beech-Ma&s;t, Oil-Works, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if &s;o, by that Time your whole Sum is paid in, a Dividend of Profits will become due, and you will receive a Hundred and &s;ixty Pounds clear Profit, upon the Forty Pounds you pay in upon your Share, as before-mention'd.</P>
<P>'Tis a Je&s;t and a Folly, not worth an&s;wering, for any Man to que&s;tion, or deny this Calculation; It is very much under-rated, and will appear &s;o to any Man, who has the Soul of a Gentleman, and Sen&s;e enough to make him capable of Demon&s;tration; I build not upon imagi|nary Schemes of what <HI>May</HI> be, but plainly prove, what <HI>Mu&s;t</HI> be; And He, who does not &s;ee and acknowledge This, &s;hou'd lay the Fault upon his own &s;hallow Judg|ment, and not Want of Force in the Argument; I write not to the Dregs of Mankind, but have been &s;o us'd to the In&s;olence and Scurrility of ignorant Men, that I for|get my pre&s;ent Readers may be the Rever&s;e of That de|te&s;table Character, and am provok'd to more Warmth than is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>You have here no dangerous Trials, no ra&s;h Adven|tures
<PB N="111" REF="110">
to make; You have no uncertain Charges to under|go, before you reap the Benefit you aim at, Your Ex|pence, on the Contrary, is &s;mall and limited, Your Pro|duct certain, vi&s;ible and common, and the Event, as in|fallible, as the Undertaking ea&s;y.</P>
<P>If Malice dares attack <HI>This</HI> Propo&s;al, nothing &s;urely can be free from Her Ill Influence; The Enemy to a De|&s;ign like <HI>This</HI>, can never be a Friend to the Intere&s;t of his Country; And 'tis a <HI>&s;illy</HI> Spleen, that leads a Man to talk, and act again&s;t a Bu&s;ine&s;s, meerly becau&s;e his Soul is nar|row, and he has not Reach of Thought enough to fathom it.</P>
<P>If any Body can object again&s;t the &s;malle&s;t Particular of what I have affirm'd in the foregoing Pages, Let him &s;tand out and attack me fairly; I de&s;ire, as the Fencers &s;ay, <HI>No Favour</HI>; But to a&s;per&s;e, to backbite, and calum|niate; to &s;tand, as it were, behind a Door, and &s;hoot at me through a Loop-Hole, is a poor and an unmanly Practice, and below the very Dignity of Humane Nature.</P>
<P>I have nothing now to add, but that I wou'd advi&s;e my Reader, after a ju&s;t, and an impartial Reflection on the Whole, to con&s;ider wi&s;ely, and not lo&s;e an Opportu|nity, which is likely to be but &s;hort; and which being now mi&s;s'd, will never happen more.</P>
<P>Weigh and con&s;ider, with the Rea&s;on of a Man, and the Spirit of a Gentleman, what a Trifle is to be ven|tur'd, in Compari&s;on with the Profit expected; How much more generous it is to run &s;o &s;mall a Hazard, were it merely in Regard to <HI>Publick Good</HI>, upon the very <HI>May be</HI> of a probable Propo&s;al, likely at lea&s;t to be beneficial to the Nation, than for Fear of lo&s;ing &s;uch an incon&s;ider|able Sum, as you may be concern'd for, to leave &s;o much as a bare <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of its failing for Want of Encourage|ment.</P>
<P>Shares are &s;old at the Beech-Oil Office, which is now kept at the <HI>Golden Key</HI>, a <HI>Woollen-Draper's</HI>, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-Yard</HI>, from 9 to 12 in the Morning, and from 2 to 5 in the Afternoon.</P>

<P>FOR the Satisfaction of All &s;uch, who may not know, What Beech-Ma&s;t is, Little Parcels of it are deliver'd with the Book.</P>
<P>Sometimes 4 and 6, but generally Two of tho&s;e little three corner'd Nuts grow together within the outward Husk, which Husk always gapes, when they are ripe, and lets them fall, upon the lea&s;t Shaking of the Tree.</P>
<P>In making the Oil, the little Nuts with the hard brown Skin, that is upon them, are all ground down to Powder by a Mill, as Almonds are, But I &s;end you to Nuts whole, that you may the better &s;ee the Nature of them.</P>
<P>Now to be at once convinc'd, as effectually as is po&s;&s;i|ble, of the great Quantity of Oil, which This Ma&s;t con|tains, you need only pull off the little brown Shell from one of the Nuts, and &s;ticking the Kernel fa&s;t upon the Point of a &s;harp Fork, hold it in a Candle, till it takes Fire, And you will &s;ee it burn with as clear a Flame, as the Candle it &s;elf, and may perceive the Oil run down an Inch or two upon the Fork, as you hold it in your Hand.</P>
<P>This little Trial, when you con&s;ider that near a Hun|dred thou&s;and of The&s;e Nuts go to make a Bu&s;hel, will as fully demon&s;trate the Fact to any Man of Sen&s;e, or Knowledge, as Ten thou&s;and Experiments; Tho' pub|lick Experiments will al&s;o be made, in va&s;t and daily Quantities, when the good Ma&s;t, which is &s;peedily ex|pected from <HI>France</HI>, and <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI>, &s;hall arrive in the River.</P>
<P>For the better Convincing you of the Certainty of This Proof, Take any little Piece of a Wall-nut, Hazel|nut, or Almond, all which are publickly known to yield half their Weight in Oil, tho' by the Price of the&s;e Nuts, their Oils are very dear, and you will &s;ee it burn exactly in the &s;ame Manner with the Beech-Ma&s;t; But on the Contrary, make the &s;ame Experiment with a Che&s;nut, or an Acorn, which have no Oil in them, and you &s;hall pre&s;ently perceive the Difference of their Natures.</P>
