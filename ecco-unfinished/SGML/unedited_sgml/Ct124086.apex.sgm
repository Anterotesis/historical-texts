<P>_CHeated! abu&s;ed! bubbled!&mdash;O 'tis too much: all the Water in the Jordan can never wa&s;h away the Remembrance of this Day's Di&s;grace&mdash;and then to be threatened with a Cart&mdash;What I! who am as intimate with the Ju&s;tices as the Keeper

<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daughter, I pray you moderate the Tide of your Re&s;entment, le&s;t it &s;hould overflow the Banks of your Rea&s;on, and &s;weep away all the cha|ritable Landmarks of Chri&s;tianity, I have taken &s;o much Trouble to erect. Con&s;ider that Revenge is a very revengeful Ingredient in the Sy&s;tem of the Heart; and that by being revengeful it is wicked, and con&s;equently a great Wickedne&s;s to encourage it in the Mind&mdash;I &s;ay therefore, Daughter, open the Eyes of your Under&s;tanding, and let Di&s;cretion teach you how to guide your Steps.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O! the dear good Man! what a de|lightful Way he has of in&s;tructing a Body!&mdash;But, Dear Sir, plea&s;e to con&s;ider that my Reputation is hurt in the &s;evere&s;t Degree; and can I patiently &s;uffer any Body to take away my good Name, without &s;hewing the charitable Force of my whole Re&s;entment; for as one of the prophane Fellows who delights the Eyes of the Play-loving Gene|ration of the Children of Vanity, at the next Door, when one of my Waiters &s;truck him a Punch in the Stomach, he cried out, "Proud <HI>Spaniard</HI> thou &s;halt feel me;" and threw a Bottle of Port at the Fellow's Head, which unfortunately mi&s;&s;ed him, broke my large Looking Gla&s;s, and &s;poiled my Green Dama&s;k Window Curtains. I am &s;ure they
<PB N="3" REF="7">
have behaved like <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> to me, and yet I mu&s;t be patient, for&s;ooth.</P>

<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> Nay, pray!&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you are going to &s;ay, Sir, but con&s;ider that I have maintained her a long Time: cloathed her when &s;he was naked; fed her when &s;he was hungry; and comforted her in Di&s;tre&s;s; nay, Did I not bring her thrice a Day to the Tabernacle to receive your pious In&s;truc|tions? And yet, after all, when I was going to make a rea&s;onable Profit of what I had &s;o generou&s;ly &s;upported, to find her run counter to all my Ex|pectations, and throw her&s;elf upon the very filthy Fellow who has threatened me with a Cart&mdash;her Cou&s;in indeed&mdash;Yes, I &s;uppo&s;e, by this Time they are very loving Cou&s;ins.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know, Sir, what you are going to &s;ay; for the better; but this is an In&s;tance to the contrary, for I am &s;ure the&s;e Cro&s;&s;es only happen for the wor&s;e. Five and fifty good Pounds, be&s;ides a Wound to my Reputation that all the Attend|ance of Doctor <HI>Rock</HI> can never heal up, could &s;carcely happen for the better, at a Time when I am &s;o regular in my Attendance at <HI>Tottenham Court,</HI> and the <HI>Moorfields</HI> Tabernacle&mdash;and &s;o, I &s;ay again, "Proud <HI>Spaniard</HI> thou &s;halt feel me;" if there's e'er an Oath to be had for Love or Money, w$thin the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Paul, Covent-Garden.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> I begin to be very much concerned about you; this is the &s;econd Time you have repeated an infernal Line out of a bla&s;|phemous Play-book; and what is a greater Scan|dal to Religion, a Line, if I mi&s;take not, written by a Mini&s;ter of the Faith, in a diabolical Per|formance called <HI>The Revenge.</HI>&mdash;Fine In&s;tructions in|deed we are likely to have, when our Clergymen are more concerned about what they produce for the Stage, than what they compo&s;e for the Pulpit! fine Times indeed are we likely to have, when &s;uch a Fellow as FOOTE is &s;uffered to ridicule the &s;ancti|fied, the orthodox Di&s;cour&s;es which I my&s;elf have delivered at the Tabernacle, to the no &s;mall Edifi|cation of Hundreds of poor Souls who wanted &s;ome Nouri&s;hment for a troubled Spirit.&mdash;I am, I &s;ay, therefore, concerned to think that you, who are a real Pattern of the primitive Purity, &s;hould pollute your Mouth with the odious Repetition of tho&s;e dete&s;table Vanities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some Allowance, Sir, &s;hould be made for the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion; this is one of the human In|firmities; and I am &s;ure I heard you &s;ay, Sir, notwith|&s;tanding your utmo&s;t Endeavours, you could never totally dive&s;t your&s;elf of it; and if &s;o good, &s;o great, &s;o&mdash;I don't know what to &s;ay, but good and great a Man as your&s;elf is ever di&s;turbed by the Calami|ties of Life, I am &s;ure it's no Wonder that I &s;hould be affected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, Daughter, you &s;ay right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In order, then, Sir, to procure Sa|tisfaction for the Injuries I have &s;uffered, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to revenge the Affronts offered to Religion by the Abu&s;e of a Woman of my exemplary Life, I have a Scheme, Sir, upon which I &s;hall beg the Favour of your Advice; and if your A&s;&s;i&s;tance could be obtained, I am in no Fear of carrying it into Execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's nothing, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> I can deny to a Woman of your extraordinary Virtue; much le&s;s refu&s;e to lend my helping Hand to any Thing that may be in the lea&s;t conducive to Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then &s;imply, Sir, the Ca&s;e is this: as that ungrateful Baggage, <HI>Lucy,</HI> has been the principal Cau&s;e of this Day's Di&s;turbance; I &s;ay the principal Means by which my hitherto un&s;ul|lied Reputation has &s;uffered, &s;uppo&s;e I was to re|turn the Compliment, and wound hers.</P>

<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain, Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;he is to be married to this young Fellow, this Mr. <HI>Wealthy,</HI> To-morrow Morning: &s;uppo&s;e we contrive &s;ome Means of making him believe &s;he has been already blown upon&mdash;The young Fellow has a pretty Sort of Pride about him, which I dare &s;ay would never &s;uffer him to marry a Woman another Man had been free with.</P>

<P>And what, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> Would you endea|vour to bla&s;t an innocent young Woman's Reputa|tion, and de&s;troy the Peace of a Family that may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;et their Hearts upon this very Match

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, they don't go to the Ta|bernacle.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why that's true, Mrs. <HI>Cole;</HI> and though tho&s;e that are not for us are again&s;t us, yet we mu&s;t con&s;ider Charity and brotherly Love, and always endeavour to do as we would done by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir! but &s;uppo&s;e this very Me|thod &s;hould oblige the young Woman to leave the Error of her Ways, and flee from the Wrath to come; you would have no Objection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not any, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> but how can that be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know, Sir, upon this young Fellow's Refu&s;al of her, the Cau&s;e mu&s;t naturally be a&s;&s;igned; and that may perhaps get Wind, and prevent any other Match, or po&s;&s;ibly enflame the impetuo&s;ity of her Father's Temper, to turn her again out of Doors; and we have many In&s;tances Sir, where the Cruelty of a Father, and the Neglect of a Lover have furni&s;hed the Tabernacle with $rouds, and the Garden with Votaries. I am &s;ure the principal Part of my Profit and your Reputa|tion have flowed from one of the&s;e Quarters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Madam,&mdash;and &s;ince you bring it to my Remembrance, Pray how does <HI>Diana Dieaway,</HI> the Milliner's Apprentice that u&s;ed to be &s;o con&s;tant an Attendant on my <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Evening Lectures?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We are both per&s;ecuted, Sir; both &s;everely handled by the Malice of the wicked ones, but it's a comfort to think that one's own Con&s;cience can accu&s;e one with nothing; and that the more we &s;uffer here, the more we &s;hall enjoy in the New <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to come&mdash;But as I was &s;aying, Sir,&mdash;Come, Sir, take another Drop, it will keep the Wind out of your Stomach, Sir, and get you an Appetite for Dinner&mdash;But as I was &s;aying, Sir&mdash;How do you approve of my De&s;ign?</P>

Upon the whole, Sir, I found that <HI>Loa|der</HI> had been pretty well acquainted with Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy,</HI> and that it was a Scheme of his and Mrs. <HI>Cole</HI>'s to introduce her to you in the Character they did, that by that Means &s;he might impo&s;e upon your Good-nature, and effect a Reconciliation with her Family; as they &s;eemed to think her Face not altogether new enough for the Garden.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="34">
The Villain <HI>Loader</HI> under the mo&s;t &s;olemn Pro|mi&s;es of eternal Fidelity, won her un&s;u&s;pecting Heart, and from the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urances of his marrying her, &s;he yielded, and was undone: Their Commerce was no &s;ooner known, than her Friends abandoned her, and turned her out of Doors; and to compleat her Misfortunes, &s;he was left de&s;titute of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, by her &s;candalous Seducer, in a Situation that re|quired the utmo&s;t Tenderne&s;s and Care.&mdash;Then it was &s;he met the pious Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> who from a pretended Concern for her Welfare, obtained her Confidence and E&s;teem. After her Delivery the old Beldame made her Propo&s;als which were re|ceived with Horror; but the Terrors of a Gaol, and the exqui&s;ite Force of a Mother's Fondne&s;s for the Pre&s;ervation of her Infant, got the better at length of her Re&s;olution, and &s;he was obliged to con&s;ent. She has heard, I &s;uppo&s;e, of this Affair of mine, and from her Knowledge of <HI>Lucy</HI>'s Behaviour, wants to put me upon my Guard. The Difficulty now is, how to break off the Match with Honour, without expo&s;ing the unfortunate Girl, or de&s;troying the Reputation of my own Family; for Oh! I love her too well to &s;ee her de&s;pi&s;ed by any Body&mdash;but my&s;elf. What an artful Tale did &s;he tell of de&s;titute Vir|tue and Innocence pre&s;erved!
