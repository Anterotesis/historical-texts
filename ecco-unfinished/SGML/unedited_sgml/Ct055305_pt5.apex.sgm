<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO give materials their due u&s;e and ar|rangement, is the chief property that di&s;tingui&s;hes Hi&s;tory from Compilation; and no period, perhaps, ever required a forming hand more than that which is contained in the following volume. We will venture to &s;ay that, from the events it de&s;cribes, the &s;y|&s;tem of Europe pre&s;ents us with a new face; and that both the military and civil genius of Great Britain have a&s;&s;umed appearances dif|ferent from tho&s;e they formerly wore, in their mo&s;t glorious periods.</P>
<P>The fourth volume of this Continuation ended when the American and Ea&s;t Indian power of France were next to annihilated; and when, by the operation of the famous Family Compact among&s;t the different branches of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, we were upon the eve of a war with Spain. The Pub|lick has not forgot the dangers, difficulties, and lo&s;&s;es to this nation, attending the war with the &s;ame people, which was &s;o lamely terminated by the peace of Aix la Chapelle,
<PB N="iv" REF="30">
after a continuance of almo&s;t ten years. The late Spani&s;h war, though it la&s;ted &s;carcely the tenth part of that time, had more important objects, and was more deci&s;ive in its events; but we will venture to &s;ay, that no account of it has hitherto appeared, from whence a reader can form an adequate idea of its plan and pur|po&s;es, which were more exten&s;ive, more truly national, and more rapidly executed than any that Great Britain was ever engaged in.&mdash;The operations of a few months cut a&s;under the &s;inews of Spani&s;h power, and protected Por|tugal, the only country where Spain and France could have attacked us with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The glorious con&s;equences of this war to Great Britain, have introduced a new &s;y&s;tem of policy all over Europe.&mdash;Great Britain, alone, has encountered and defeated the once dreaded power of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, and accompli&s;hed what, before the com|mencement of the late war, would have been thought arrogance for an Engli&s;hman even to have imagined. The power of France on the continent of Europe has been broken le&s;s by our re&s;i&s;ting it, than by our taking n$ improper lead in the affairs of Germany, an$
<PB N="v" REF="40">
by leaving the intere&s;ts of that empire to be ballanced by its own con&s;tituent parts, which, when no foreign influence operates, will always pre&s;erve a proper equilibre. France can now no longer dictate to Great Britain by land, becau&s;e the latter has no object in Germany, for which &s;he can be brought to ri&s;que her mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential concerns; and the attention which &s;he formerly directed to the continent of Europe, is now transferred to that of Ame|rica and our American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The late peace has had other great effects upon the general &s;y&s;tem of Europe. By delivering us from our continental allies, we are freed from a burthen too heavy for us, on account of the &s;ub&s;idies we were obliged to pay them in time of peace, and the different views they had from tho&s;e of Great Britain in time of war. The&s;e are truths fully proved by the events de&s;cribed in the &s;hort interval on which the following pages are employed, and which produces what may be called the cata&s;trophe, or completion of all the tran&s;actions contained in the four preceding volumes.</P>
<P>The reader, in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;heets (the con|nexion of which with that of the preceding, he
<PB N="vi" REF="50">
may find in the note annexed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of Gre|nada refu&s;ed to obey the &s;um|mons of commodore Swan|ton; but he being joined by a body of troops under the command of brigadier-ge|neral Wal&s;h, who was de|tached upon this &s;ervice by general Monckt$n, they thought proper to &s;ubmit without further oppo&s;ition, although the i&s;land, by the nature of its &s;ituation, was capable of making a vigor|cus defence. It lies about fifty leagues to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Barbadoes, has a good har|bour, and the &s;oil produces &s;ugar, indigo, and many other valuable commodities. The inhabitants enjoyed the &s;ame capitulation which had been granted to the people of Martinique; and this was ex|tended to the Grenadillas, a number of &s;mall fruitful i&s;lands by which the other is &s;urrounded. At the &s;ame time the Engli&s;h troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands St. Lucie, Tobago, and St. Vin|cent, which the French had begun to &s;ettle, although they had been con&s;idered as neutral by the late treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two nations.&mdash;While the Briti&s;h armament remained at Mar|tinique, a French fleet ap|peared to windward of the i&s;land, and &s;ent an officer on &s;hore to receive intelligence. They continued crui&s;ing to windward for two days, and even approached within can|non-&s;hot of Trinity, as if their intention had been to make a de&s;cent: but after|wards they changed their cour&s;e, and bore away for the i&s;land of Dominique. Ad|miral Rodney being informed of their arrival on the coa&s;t of Martinique, got under &s;ail with his $quadron, and beat up to windward in que&s;t of the enemy; but they did not wait his coming.</NOTE>) will &s;ee a new plan of internal as well as external policy adopted by the Briti&s;h government, which has been productive of great altercation, and attended with various impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of a people, jealous to exce&s;s of their civil liberty, and greedily embracing every opportunity, whether real or delu&s;ive, which
<PB N="vii" REF="60">
they think can tend either to enlarge or &s;e|cure it. The &s;ame principle that has taken off from our necks the dead weight of conti|nental connections, has removed the &s;creen which they but too often placed between the king and the &s;ubject, to the irreparable lo&s;s of both.&mdash;The throne is now acce&s;&s;ible to all ranks and orders of men; becau&s;e the mo|narch who fills it knows he has nothing to apprehend from tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which, in former times, were too artfully propagated, and too ha&s;tily believed. The&s;e are facts which have been fully explained in the pre|ceding parts of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t care has been taken, in the cour&s;e of this volume, to a&s;certain the pro|per boundaries between Prerogative and Pri|vilege, and to di&s;tingui&s;h the real acqui&s;itions Liberty has made, from the dangerous inno|vations Faction would introduce. The reader has here a clear view of tho&s;e improvements and advantages that are, or ought to be, the concomitants of new e&s;tabli&s;hed peace. No argument urged in favour of any of the public parties among us, has been either &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, di&s;gui&s;ed, or weakened in the re|pre&s;entation; and as national affairs, never, &s;ince the Revolution took place, have had &s;o fair a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as during the pre&s;ent reign,
<PB N="viii" REF="70">
the author has endeavoured to avail him&s;elf of the &s;everal tracts that carry the greate&s;t autho|rity with either party; and nothing can give him more plea&s;ure than in pre&s;erving, with the rational and &s;ober part of his country|men, the character of a ju&s;t and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate hi&s;torian.</P>

<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762. Tran&s;ac|tions in parlia|ment.</NOTE> BEFORE we relate the con&s;equences of the new war with Spain, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to particularize the other tran&s;actions in parliament which di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;$&s;&s;ion&punc; as well as to give a detail of &s;ome dome&s;tic occur|rences; and then proceed, as u&s;ual, to the opera|tions of war on the continent of Germany. In the cour&s;e of the preceding year, it had been thought proper to lay an additional duty of three &s;hillings on every barrel of beer; and as this did not immediately take place, it made little impre&s;|&s;ion on the minds of the people: but now that the brewers began to rai&s;e the price of their li|quor, and the publicans in con&s;equence re&s;olved to demand one halfpenny extraordinary on every quart of &s;trong beer, the cities of London and
<PB N="10" REF="90">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> We&s;tmin&s;ter were filled with tumult. The popu|lace vowed revenge again&s;t the brewers for exact|ing a higher price than u&s;ual from the victuallers; and even threatened to pull down the hou&s;es of tho&s;e publicans who &s;hould charge the additional halfpenny on their beer. Under the terror of the&s;e menaces, they petitioned the hou&s;e of commons for protection and relief; and a new act was pa&s;&s;ed in favour of their reque&s;t. It implied that no brewer or retailer of &s;trong beer or ale &s;hould be liable to be &s;ued, impleaded, or mole&s;ted, by indictment, in|formation, popular action, or otherwi&s;e, for ad|vancing the price; and that, on the other hand, they &s;hould not be allowed to mix it, on any pre|tence what&s;oever, after the gauge of it &s;hould be taken by an officer of the exci&s;e. It may be worth ob&s;erving, that all the odium of this unpopular tax fell upon the pre&s;ent king and his mini&s;try, tho' it was a mea&s;ure planned, regulated, and &s;ettled in the la&s;t reign: &s;uch is the prepo&s;terous caprice of a vulgar indulged in in&s;olence and riot.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New mi|litia act.</NOTE> Another law was pa&s;&s;ed to explain, amend, and reduce into one act, the &s;everal laws relating to the militia, which had been found hitherto ineffec|tual. By this la&s;t regulation, pari&s;h-officers are impowered, with the con&s;ent of the inhabitants, to provide voluntiers for the militia, by a rate on the pari&s;h, in proportion to that for the relief of their poor. It is al&s;o provided, that no per&s;on under eighteen or above forty-five, nor articled clerk, apprentice, or pauper with three children born in wedlock, &s;hall be compelled to &s;erve. By the&s;e alterations in the militia law, every man is
<PB N="11" REF="100">
to pay his quota; all pari&s;hes have it in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> their power to keep their u&s;eful hands at home, and to employ the idle and di&s;&s;olute in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for the regu|lation of prize|money.</NOTE> A bill was moreover pa&s;&s;ed for ve&s;ting the pro|perty of all Spani&s;h prizes in the captors, and for continuing during the pre&s;ent war with Spain, all the provi&s;ions and regulations which were made on the &s;ame &s;ubject in different acts pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-ninth, thirty-&s;econd, and thirty-third years of the late reign. It might de&s;erve the con&s;ide|ration of the legi&s;lature, whether it would not be expedient to alter the proportions in which all prize-money is at pre&s;ent di&s;tributed to the officers and &s;ailors on board a &s;hip of war. Nothing can be more ab&s;urd than the regulation by which a captain &s;hares three-eighths of the prize, amount|ing to one-eighth more than is divided among the whole crew of common &s;eamen. In con&s;equence of this ridiculous cu&s;tom, private captains are of|ten rai&s;ed by accident to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of over|grown fortunes, to which their merit gives them no title; and the hope of &s;uch an exorbitant &s;hare of booty renders them &s;o eager in the pur&s;uit of trading ve&s;&s;els, that they often neglect opportuni|ties of acting more vigorou&s;ly again&s;t the enemy. If the captain's &s;hare was limited to one-&s;ixteenth, he would have a proportion &s;ufficiently &s;uited to his rank; another &s;ixteenth might be added to the &s;hare of the &s;eamen; and one-fourth of the whole prize might be employed in the &s;ervice of the public.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="110">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762. Other bills.</NOTE> With a view to prevent in &s;ome mea&s;ure certain inhuman practices relating to poor pari&s;h children within the bills of mortality, the parliament en|acted a law for keeping an annual regi&s;ter of tho&s;e infants in every pari&s;h, under the age of four, a time of life in which they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be more particularly expo&s;ed to the barbarity of their nur|&s;es, &s;ome of whom were &s;aid to be the more fa|voured by the over&s;eers of the poor, the more dexterous they proved them&s;elves in di&s;patching the unhappy orphans committed to their charge. The &s;u&s;picion that &s;uch cruelties had been exer|ci&s;ed, was &s;upported by &s;trong pre&s;umptions, which indeed gave ri&s;e to this bill in favour of pu|blic regi&s;ters, which will be a con&s;iderable check upon the over&s;eers. They will point out tho&s;e pa|ri&s;hes where the greate&s;t mortality prevails among tho&s;e haple&s;s children, and perhaps induce the le|gi&s;lature to inquire into the cau&s;e of this calamity. The pari&s;h-officers, thus open to detection, will execute their office with a more con&s;cious regard to the duties of chri&s;tian humanity.</P>
<P>A new law was made for rendering London-bridge more acce&s;&s;ible for the convenience of com|merce; and another to facilitate a &s;cheme for &s;up|plying the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter with fre&s;h fi&s;h by land-carriage from different parts of the kingdom. This u&s;eful &s;cheme, conceived and dige&s;ted by a private gentleman called Blake, a de&s;cendant of the celebrated admiral Blake, was pa|tronized by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, who advanced a con&s;iderable &s;um towards the execution of it; and the capital was in a little
<PB N="13" REF="120">
time &s;upplied with great plenty and variety of ex|cellent<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1762.</NOTE> fi&s;h, by the indu&s;try and ingenuity of the projector. He had no other view but that of re&s;cu|ing the people from the tyranny of a few indivi|duals, who had long monopolized the market, and kept up the commodity at exorbitant rates: but whether a &s;cheme founded on public utility, openly executed, and hone&s;tly pur&s;ued, will be able to maintain its ground again&s;t a powerful combina|tion of wealthy individuals, who will not &s;cruple to expend large &s;ums to effect its mi&s;carriage, time alone will di&s;cover <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a new law for the pre&s;ervation of the game, it was decreed, that after the fir&s;t day of June next en&s;u|ing, no partridge, phea&s;ant, heath-fowl, or grou&s;e, &s;hould be killed, taken, or &s;old, any year, between the twelfth day of February and fir&s;t of September, for partridges; between the fir&s;t of Febru|ary and the fir&s;t of October, for phea&s;ants; between the fir&s;t of January and the twentieth of Augu&s;t, for heath-fowl, commonly called black-game; and between the fir&s;t of December and the twenty-fifth day of July, for the grou&s;e, commonly cal|led the red-game.&mdash;The per&s;on offending again&s;t this law to forfeit five pounds for every bird, to the pro&s;ecutor.</NOTE>.</P>

As a reward for their fidelity, and a further encouragement to prote&s;tant adventu|rers, it was now enacted that all foreigners of this
<PB N="14" REF="130">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> religion, as well officers as &s;oldiers, who had &s;er|ved, or &s;hould hereafter &s;erve, in the Royal Ame|rican regiment, or as engineers in America, for the &s;pace of two years, taking and &s;ub&s;cribing the oaths, &s;hould be deemed natural-born &s;ubjects of Great-Britain to all intents and purpo&s;es; except that no per&s;on naturalized by this act, &s;hould be held capable of being a member of the privy council, or either hou&s;e of parliament, or of en|joying any office or place of tru&s;t within the king|doms of Great-Britain and Ireland, either civil or military; or any grant from the crown to him&s;elf, or to any other in tru&s;t for him, of any lands, tene|ments, or hereditaments, within the &s;aid king|doms. Neither does the benefit of this act extend to children born out of the king's allegiance, who&s;e fathers, at the birth of &s;uch children, were liable to the penalties of high-trea&s;on or felony, or in the &s;ervice of any foreign power at war with Great-Britain, excepting &s;till the children of tho&s;e who quitted Ireland in pur&s;uance of the capitula|tion of Limerick. Yet even this Jewi&s;h law of vi|&s;iting the iniquities of the fathers on the children, which had pa&s;&s;ed in the fourth year of the late reign, had been mitigated by another clau&s;e in the &s;ame act, importing, That the privileges of natu|ralization &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, be enjoyed by every child thus di&s;qualified, who &s;hould make it appear that he had re&s;ided two years in any part of the Briti&s;h dominions, between the &s;ixteenth day of November in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and eight, and the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty-one,

and had profe&s;&s;ed the prote&s;tant religion, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> died in Great-Britain or the dominions thereof, within the &s;aid term; or had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any lands, or made any &s;ettlement in Great-Britain or Ireland. The practice of naturalizing foreign prote&s;tants is certainly, at this juncture, highly expedient for the benefit of Great-Britain and her colonies; now&punc; when the mother-country is &s;o depopulated by war and migration, that there is not a &s;ufficient num|ber of hands left for the purpo&s;es of agriculture, manufacture, and commerce; and when the na|tion has made the acqui&s;ition of rich i&s;lands, and an immen&s;e continent, who&s;e value mu&s;t always depend upon their population.</P>
<P>A new law was made for &s;ecuring the additional &s;alaries to the pui&s;ne judges, whom the king had rendered independent, in the cour&s;e of the preced|ing &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The mutiny bill was pa&s;&s;ed as an annual regu|lation; and the parliament enacted an explanatory<NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the lon|gitude at &s;ea.</NOTE> law for a further encouragement to tho&s;e who &s;hould make any progre&s;s towards the di&s;covery of a cer|tain method for finding out the longitude at &s;ea, that great de&s;ideratum in the art of navigation. Mr. Harri&s;on, a clock-maker of London, had con|trived a curious time-piece, which, under the di|rection of his &s;on, was tried in a voyage to the We&s;t-Indies, and found to &s;ucceed in all experi|ments infinitely beyond any thing which had been hitherto invented on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Mr. Irwin, a native of Ireland, had al&s;o contrived a marine chair, by means of which it was found practicable, in the roughe&s;t weather at &s;ea, to take ob&s;ervations
<PB N="16" REF="150">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> of the immer&s;ions and emer&s;ions of Jupiter's &s;atel|lites, from which the longitude may be a&s;certained. This machine had been found &s;ucce&s;sful upon trial; and now a board of longitude was held at the Ad|miralty, to con&s;ider the merit of tho&s;e improve|ments, in con&s;equence of the act lately pa&s;&s;ed. Mr. Harri&s;on and his &s;on were gratified with a re|ward of fifteen hundred pounds; and five hun|dred were be&s;towed upon Mr. Irwin. Many me|thods were, at this time, propo&s;ed for finding the longitude at &s;ea, and &s;ome of them appeared to be extremely ingenious: but as none of them had been reduced to practice by actual experiment, the claims and preten&s;ions of their &s;everal authors were neglected or overlooked <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a bill pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, an annuity of three thou&s;and pounds was &s;ettled and &s;ecured for the u&s;e of Arthur On&s;low, E&s;q; late &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of com|mons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion being ended, the king concluded it with a &s;peech, as u&s;ual, on the &s;econd day of June, when both hou&s;es were prorogued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;ac|tions of the Iri&s;h parlia|ment.</NOTE> There was nothing remarkable that di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;e&s;&s;ion in the parliament of Ireland, except a remarkable re&s;olution in favour of their lord&punc;lieute|nant the earl of Halifax, who&s;e conduct they in|tirely approved, and who&s;e character they held in the utmo&s;t veneration. They unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved on an addre&s;s to his excellency, de&s;iring he would repre&s;ent to the king the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e, that the appointments of the lord-lieutenant were be|come

At the &s;ame time they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction at the plea&s;ing hope that this augmentation &s;hould take place during the admini&s;tration of a chief governor who&s;e many great and amiable qualities, who&s;e wi&s;e and happy admini&s;tration in the government of that kingdom, had univer&s;ally endeared him to the people of Ire|land. The earl received this glorious te&s;timony of their approbation with all &s;uitable acknowledg|ments: but, with a delicacy peculiar to him&s;elf, declined their propo&s;al that the augmentation &s;hould take place during his government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tion in that king|dom.</NOTE> The peace of that kingdom had been for &s;ome time di&s;turbed by a &s;et of licentious people, who a&s;&s;embled in the night in arms, and committed many outrages in different parts of the i&s;land. They were indi&s;criminately di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of White Boys and Levellers, becau&s;e they wore linen &s;hirts over their cloaths, that they might know one another in the dark; and level|led all the inclo&s;ures which had encroached up|on commons. Indeed, this was not the only grie|vance of which they complained. They looked upon every diminution of a common as an injury to the poor, who had u&s;ed to enjoy the benefit of that common. They therefore not only de&s;troyed the fences which had lately been made, but al&s;o robbed and maltreated the authors and proprietors
<PB N="18" REF="170">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> of tho&s;e encroachments. They even made head again&s;t &s;ome parties and detachments that were &s;ent to &s;uppre&s;s them&punc; and &s;ome lives were lo&s;t. A re|port began to gain ground that tho&s;e were no other than a&s;&s;emblies of malcontents taking mea&s;ures a|gain&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed government: that they were already encrea&s;ed to a formidable number, well armed and di&s;ciplined by officers, who had come for that purpo&s;e from France and other foreign countries. The&s;e &s;urmi&s;es, however, were ab&s;o|lutely without foundation, and all tho&s;e petty in&s;ur|rections were quelled by the vigilance and wi&s;e conduct of the lord-lieutenant, who, neverthele&s;s, found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome exam|ples of &s;everity, in order to prevent &s;uch di&s;tur|bances for the future. What contributed, per|haps, to the more &s;peedy re&s;toration of that king|dom's quiet, was the rai&s;ing of &s;ix new battalions on that e&s;tabli&s;hment, which were, in the cour&s;e of this year, levied in Ireland, of prote&s;tants and catholics indi&s;criminately; an experiment which &s;ucceeded according to the wi&s;h of tho&s;e by whom it was projected. This and other indulgencies which may be &s;afely granted to the catholics in Ire|land, who are generally well affected to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed government, would prevent the emigration of many indu&s;trious hands, who are not only lo&s;t to their native country, but even contribute to &s;trengthen the power of the enemies of Great-Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark|able im|po&s;ture in London.</NOTE> In giving a detail of the dome&s;tic tran&s;actions which happened during the cour&s;e of this year in Great-Britain, it may be deemed &s;uperfluous to

From the frivolous pur&s;uits of the people, their rage for novelty, their admiration of &s;hew and pageantry, their ridiculous extravagance, their licentious conduct, their &s;avage appetite for war and carnage which they had for &s;ome time avowed, and the &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition with which they be|gan to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, one would be apt to believe that the human mind had begun to degenerate, and that mankind was relap&s;ing into their original ignorance and barbarity. In the beginning of the year, the inhabitants of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter were alarmed and engro&s;&s;ed by the impo&s;ture of a child of ten years of age, the daughter of one Par|&s;ons, clerk of a pari&s;h in Cock-Lane, near We&s;t-Smithfield. This girl, tutored in all appearance by the father for the purpo&s;es of malice, pretended to be vi&s;ited by the &s;pirit of a young woman who had formerly lodged in the hou&s;e, and died about a year and a half before this period. This per|&s;on, who went by the name of Fanny, had lived in familiarity with one Mr. K&mdash;t, a broker. He had been the hu&s;band of her &s;i&s;ter, and would have willingly taken Fanny to wife: but this union being forbid by the canon law, the parties agreed to indulge their mutual pa&s;&s;ion without the ceremony of the church, and lived together with great har|mony,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> until &s;he was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox, of which di&s;temper &s;he died, to the un&s;peakable grief of her lover, to whom &s;he bequeathed the whole of her &s;lender fortune. Mr. K&mdash;t had, it &s;eems, incurred the re&s;entment of P&mdash;s, by pre&s;&s;ing him for the payment of &s;ome money he had lent him while he lodged at his hou&s;e; and this is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the &s;ource of the plan which he now projected for the broker's de&s;truction. His daughter pretended to &s;ee the apparition of Fanny, who&s;e favourite &s;he had been. She was &s;eized with fits and agitations; and &s;trange noi&s;es of &s;cratch|ing, fluttering, whi&s;pering, and knocking, were heard in the apartment where &s;he lay. A woman who lived in the hou&s;e, and was an accomplice in the impo&s;ture, pretended to hold conferences with the &s;pectre. She a&s;ked if it was the &s;pirit of Fan|ny; and if it was, de&s;ired the affirmative might be &s;ignified by a certain number of di&s;tinct knocks, which were heard accordingly. The &s;igns of a&s;&s;ent and negation being thus a&s;certained, &s;he proceeded with a number of interrogations. She a&s;ked if the &s;pirit had any thing to di&s;clo&s;e for the detection of guilt?&mdash;if it was the &s;pirit of Fanny?&mdash;if her death had been ha&s;tened by violent means?&mdash;if tho&s;e means had been u&s;ed by Mr. K&mdash;t with whom &s;he lived? To all the&s;e and many other que&s;tions, an&s;wers were made in the affirmative by three di&s;tinct knocks to each interrogation; and this &s;ort of communication was often repeated in the hearing of many different companies of peo|ple, who crowded to the hou&s;e in order to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity. The &s;ound of the knocks varied

at different times, and &s;eemed to proceed occa&s;ion|ally<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> from different parts of the room: other noi&s;es of &s;cratching, ru&s;tling, whi&s;pering, and &s;omething like the fluttering of wings, were fre|quently perceived, while the child lay in bed &s;eemingly in&s;en&s;ible; for her pre&s;ence was the &s;ole condition on which the &s;pirit would make it&s;elf known, and it declared it would follow her where|&s;oever &s;he &s;hould be conveyed. The circum|&s;tances of this &s;trange vi&s;itation being reported, with many idle exaggerations, intere&s;ted the public to &s;uch a degree, that in all a&s;&s;emblies, from the highe&s;t to the mo&s;t humble, nothing was heard but remarks and ob&s;ervations on the progre&s;s of the &s;pirit in Cock-Lane, where there was a perpe|tual flux and reflux of people of all ranks and characters, whether &s;timulated by curio&s;ity, actu|ated by &s;uper&s;tition, or attracted by the hopes of amu&s;ement and pa&s;time. What was at fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed as the gratification of revenge alone, became now a &s;ource of con&s;iderable profit, as every per|&s;on paid for admittance to the haunted chamber. Among the lower cla&s;s of people this ridiculous im|po&s;ture produced a general &s;pirit of infatuation, and filled the dome&s;tics of almo&s;t every family with &s;uch terrors as greatly di&s;concerted them in the performance of their &s;everal functions. Many weak minds in re&s;pectable &s;pheres of life, were in|fected by the fears of the vulgar. Some indivi|duals who entered the hou&s;e with a view to mirth and ridicule, were &s;o &s;truck with the &s;cene, that they became converts to the general belief. It even made an impre&s;&s;ion upon &s;ome per&s;ons of &s;u|perior

Super&s;titious terror is of all the different &s;pecies of fear the mo&s;t infectious; and when once it gains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human mind, renders all the &s;ugge&s;tions of rea&s;on ineffectual. The &s;pirit was a&s;ked if it would &s;ignify its pre&s;ence in the vault of a certain church where the body of Fanny was depo&s;ited; an an&s;wer was made in the affirmative, and the hour appointed for this expe|riment. The child was removed to another hou&s;e, and &s;o narrowly watched, that &s;he could neither make u&s;e of her own hands, nor be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by any accomplice. While &s;he remained in this &s;ituation, no knocks nor noi&s;es were heard. The vault was vi&s;ited at the hour appointed: but the &s;pirit gave no tokens of its being pre&s;ent. The girl being reconveyed to her father's hou&s;e, the noi&s;es re|turned, and the &s;purious gho&s;t declared in the u&s;ual&punc;way, that it did not exhibit in the vault be|cau&s;e the body had been previou&s;ly removed from thence, and was now interred in another place. The vault was again vi&s;ited by &s;everal per&s;ons of credit, in who&s;e pre&s;ence the coffin was opened, and the body found almo&s;t quite con&s;umed. This was an evidence which ought to have opened the eyes of the mo&s;t infatuated; and immediately af|terwards the girl being again removed to another hou&s;e, in order to be more narrowly ob&s;erved, was detected in the act of conveying to bed with her, a piece of board on which &s;he had knocked with her fingers.</P>

As the proprietors of the Antigallican privateer were &s;aid to have &s;u&s;tained a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s from the partiality of the Spaniards in the late reign, who had detained that &s;hip at Cadiz, and re&s;tored to France the rich prize which &s;he had taken; the king now ordered them a &s;hip of forty-four guns, that they might equip her as a privateer, in or|der to indemnify them&s;elves upon the &s;ubjects of Spain.

He was therefore de|termined to favour and protect all his &s;ubjects equally, without any other di&s;tinction than that of merit; and to avoid the errors of his two immedi|ate predece&s;&s;ors, who by appearing at the head of a party, had not only deprived their own councils of the be&s;t heads and be&s;t hearts in the kingdom; but al&s;o provoked &s;ome individuals to embroil the admini&s;tration, from which they found them&s;elves &s;o unju&s;tly excluded.</P>

The expul&s;ion of the Je&s;uits, and the &s;ub&s;equent difference with the &s;ee of Rome, had filled the nation with di&s;content and di&s;quiet.

Yet the aver&s;ion of the Portugue&s;e people to the Engli&s;h, whom they con&s;idered as he|reticks, was &s;o in&s;urmountable as not to be over|come, even by the &s;entiments of gratitude, for the protection they derived from their continual pro|tection and offices of friend&s;hip. The officers of Britain, even $n their endeavours to di&s;tre&s;s the in|vaders of Portugal, were upon all occa&s;ions thwart|ed, impeded, and oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e wretched bigots, who would rather have been en&s;laved, even by the odious Spaniard, than owe their deliverance to the more dete&s;ted &s;ubjects of Great Britain. Their ani|mo&s;ity to the Spaniards was founded on temporal provocations; but their abhorrence of the Engli&s;h

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inactivity of the Spaniards</NOTE> The Spani&s;h forces had, without all doubt, many difficulties to encounter from the nature of the country, which was not only extremely mountain|ous, but &s;o very barren and wretchedly poor, as to afford little or nothing for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Ne|verthele&s;s, had they been really bent upon the con|que&s;t of the kingdom; had they advanced with &s;pirit, activity and per&s;everance, and made a proper u&s;e of all the advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it was &s;up|po&s;ed they might have penetrated to Li&s;bon before any effectual mea&s;ures could have been taken to ob|&s;truct their progre&s;s. But, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting their fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s with vigour, they lingered in their operations, and during the heats of &s;ummer, were di&s;tributed into quarters of refre&s;hment. The&s;e de|lays &s;eemed to corroborate the &s;u&s;picion of a &s;ecret under&s;tanding between the courts of Madrid and Li&s;bon. Had the Spaniards taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole kingdom, the war in that quarter mu&s;t have been terminated. The Briti&s;h &s;uccours would have been withdrawn by means of a &s;quadron, which re|mained in the Tagus to an&s;wer any emergency of that nature; and perhaps the next armament from England would have been directed again&s;t Bra&s;il.</P>

uncommon courage, conduct, and expedition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> For this enterprize the count pitched upon briga|dier Burgoyne, who, on the twenty-fifth day of July, pa&s;&s;ed the Tagus at midnight, with four hun|dred of his own dragoons, and put him&s;elf at the head of all the Briti&s;h grenadiers, commanded by lord Pulteney, and eleven companies of Portugue&s;e grenadiers, with two pieces of light artillery, and two howitzers. Having marched acro&s;s the coun|try to Apallem, which he reached on the morning of the twenty-fifth, he proceeded to Ca&s;tel-Vida, where, arriving late at night, he was joined by &s;ome infantry, and irregular cavalry, with forty-eight armed pea&s;ants; and here he made his final di&s;po&s;i|tion, in con&s;equence of the advices he received touching the &s;ituation and the &s;tate of the place he was determined to attack. Notwith&s;tanding all the di&s;patch he could make in the night, he found him|&s;elf overtaken by day-light, before he could reach Valencia; &s;o that he was obliged to lay a&s;ide the di&s;po&s;ition he had made, and advance with the ca|valry at full gallop, in hope of &s;urpri&s;ing the place. He accordingly entered the town &s;word in hand, di&s;per&s;ed the guards that were in the great &s;quare, and occupied the ends of the &s;treets, having met with little or no re&s;i&s;tance. Some de&s;perate parties attacked the regiment when it was formed in the &s;quare; but they were all killed or taken. When the grenadiers came up, they &s;u&s;tained &s;ome lo&s;s by &s;iring from the windows, which however &s;oon cea&s;|ed, when the brigadier declared that he would &s;et fire to the town at the four quarters of it, if they would not de&s;i&s;t.

A Briti&s;h &s;erjeant and &s;ix men only, falling in with a &s;ubal|tern of the enemy, at the head of twenty-five dra|goons, unbroken and prepared for action, killed &s;ix, made all the re&s;t pri&s;oners, and took the hor&s;es of the whole party. Major-general Don Michael d'Iruniberri, and Kalanca his aid-de-camp, one co|lonel with his adjutant, two captains, &s;eventeen &s;u|balterns, fifty-nine &s;oldiers, with three pair of co|lours, a great quantity of arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the victor, who brought away ho&s;tages for the care of the wounded; and the pay|ment of the king's revenue for one year, which he exacted as a con&s;ideration for having &s;pared the town and convents. Lieutenant colonel Somer|ville, lord Pulteney, and major Singleton, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in this action, which co&s;t the Briti&s;h troops but one lieutenant, one &s;erjeant, and three men killed, with ten hor&s;es, and about twenty private men wounded. The information which the count had received about the magazine, was groundle&s;s; but the Spani&s;h major-general d'Iruni|berri was to have entered Alentejo in a few days, with a con&s;iderable detachment, and when taken was actually employed in reconnoitering the en|trance into that province.</P>

by Al&s;ayates to Ca&s;tel Branco; and this motion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> obliged the count de la Lippe to abandon his &s;trong camp at Ponte de Murcella in the Beira, from whence he marched back into E&s;tremadoura. On the eighteenth day of September, he arrived at Abrantes; and lord Loudon, with a &s;eparate corps, encamped at Sardoal in the neighbourhood. The bu&s;ine&s;s now was to prevent the Spaniards from forcing a pa&s;&s;age through the mountains in their front, and from cro&s;&s;ing the river Tagus at Villa-velha. For the&s;e purpo&s;es the mar&s;hal count de la Lippe ordered the count St. Jago, with four battalions, &s;ix companies of grenadiers, and a regi|ment of cavalry, to occupy the &s;trong pa&s;s of Al|vito, which had been e&s;teemed impregnable; and brigadier general Burgoyne, with part of his own regiment, the royal volunteers, and the Engli&s;h grenadiers, encamped on the &s;outhern bank of the Tagus, over-again&s;t Villa-velha, where the great road from Ca&s;tel Branco cro&s;&s;es the river into Alentejo. Such was the di&s;po&s;ition, when the enemy, on the fir&s;t day of October, made &s;everal movements towards both the&s;e advanced bodies; they placed &s;ix thou&s;and men over-again&s;t the corps of the count St. Jago, and attacked upon his right the old Moori&s;h ca&s;tle of Villa-velha, at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;aulting a po&s;t upon his left, commanded by a major at the defile of St. Simon. Though briga|dier Burgoyne for &s;everal days protected the ca&s;tle of Villa-velha, by his cannon acro&s;s the river, it was at length reduced, and the po&s;t of St. Simon taken: the enemy likewi&s;e made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains; &s;o that the corps com|manded

His lord|&s;hip immediately advanced with great expedition by the &s;horte&s;t road through the mountains, to Soubrira-formo&s;a, where he was joined by major Macbean of the artillery, with four regimental field pieces. The enemy, perceiving their intention to retreat, detached a &s;trong body over the river Al|vito, to harra&s;s the rear-guard, which was formed of four Engli&s;h regiments, &s;ix companies of Portu|gue&s;e grenadiers, a few light dragoons, a regiment of Portugue&s;e cavalry, with the four field pieces, the whole under his lord&s;hip's command. The re|treat was conducted with &s;uch good order and countenance, that not a man was lo&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding all the efforts of the enemy, who, being much galled by the artillery, thought proper to de|&s;i&s;t, while the forces of Portugal continued their march unmole&s;ted towards Cardegas.</P>

This gallant officer executed the plan with equal &s;pirit and &s;ucce&s;s, while the brigadier pointed his cannon, and made a fal&s;e attack on the other &s;ide, to amu&s;e and di&s;tract the enemy.

The enemy being at length alarmed, began to make a confu&s;ed and irregular defence; but being vigorou&s;ly pu&s;hed by the grenadiers and volunteers, who u&s;ed their bayonets without firing, they found it impo&s;&s;ible to form, and were obliged to &s;ubmit. The only part of them that made a regular &s;tand was a body of hor&s;e, which lieutenant Maitland, at the head of Burgoyne's dragoons, attacked and routed in a few minutes. Mo&s;t of the Spani&s;h officers, including a brigadier-general, were &s;lain in endea|vouring to rally their troops. Four cannon were &s;piked up in their camp: their magazines were de|&s;troyed; &s;ome pri&s;oners were taken, together with a good number of hor&s;es and mules, and a con&s;i|derable quantity of valuable baggage. The lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h on this occa&s;ion, did not exceed ten men and hor&s;es.

After &s;upper, Mark-Anthony going down &s;tairs, threw a bar acro&s;s two folding doors of a warehou&s;e, and from thence &s;u&s;pended him&s;elf &s;o effectually, that he was dead before any per&s;on in the family could &s;u&s;pect his de&s;ign. He was fir&s;t di&s;covered by his brother and young La Vai&s;&s;e, who being &s;hocked at the &s;pec|tacle, &s;hrieked aloud.

The unhappy old man, &s;eeing the fatal cau&s;e of the outcry, ru&s;hed forwards, and embracing the body of his &s;on, the bar &s;lipped off the folding doors, and the corp&s;e fell upon the floor. He forthwith loo&s;ened the cord in an agony of grief and horror, and, deploring the fate of his child, di&s;patched his &s;on Peter for a &s;urgeon, exclaiming at the &s;ame time, "Save at lea&s;t the ho|nour of my family; do not divulge the report that your brother has made away with him&s;elf." Mean while the mother, deriving &s;trength from de&s;pair, ran down &s;tairs in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction, and join|ing the re&s;t of the family, the hou&s;e was filled with cries and lamentations, which gathered a croud about the door.

<PB N="71" REF="720">
found the mark of the cord about the neck, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> declared that the decea&s;ed had been &s;trangled. This declaration no &s;ooner reached the populace in the &s;treet, than they began to cry out, that Mark-Anthony Calas intended to abjure the prote&s;tant here&s;y next day; that prote&s;tants were bound by the religion they profe&s;&s;ed, to de&s;troy all their own children who expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to renounce their errors; that there was an executioner appointed among them for this horrid purpo&s;e; that La Vai&s;&s;e was the per&s;on who at pre&s;ent performed this office; that he had, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the family, exe|cuted the unhappy youth; and that the cries which they had heard, were uttered by him in his endea|vours to re&s;i&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The old man being by this time joined by one or two of his friends, and perceiving the tumult and uproar increa&s;ing every moment, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to the capi|toul, who&s;e name was David, one of tho&s;e mi&s;cre|ants, who, for the misfortune of mankind, and to the di&s;grace of civil government, are &s;ometimes promoted to the chief magi&s;tracy. This wretch, equally ignorant, rancorous, and inhuman, had been already alarmed, and adopting immediately all the prejudices of the vulgar, a&s;&s;embled a guard of forty &s;oldiers, with whom he entered the hou&s;e. The fir&s;t &s;tep he took was to impri&s;on the whole family, together with La Vai&s;&s;e. Then he ordered the body to be examined by &s;urgeons, who declared, that except the mark of the ligature upon the neck, they perceived no marks of violence; that the hair of the decea&s;ed was perfectly &s;mooth and in good order; that his cloaths which he had pulled off

Next day the verbal proce&s;s being taken, and no evidence appearing to the prejudice of the family, the implacable and iniquitous capitoul had recour&s;e to a monitory, which was publi&s;hed, invit|ing all per&s;ons who knew any particular of the affair, to give te&s;timony again&s;t the perpetrators of the &s;uppo&s;ed murder. In this monitory, the infa|mous magi&s;trate recited, as undubitable truths, that the prote&s;tants were in the con&s;tant practice of putting to death their children when they &s;eemed bent upon renouncing their errors; that La Vai&s;&s;e was the per&s;on employed in the&s;e executions; that Mark&punc;Anthony Calas certainly intended to abjure his here&s;y; and was therefore cruelly murdered with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his own parents.

He en&s;ranchi&s;ed the Ru&s;&s;ian noble&s;&s;e, declaring, that for the future, they &s;hould be intitled to the &s;ame rank and privileges that were enjoyed by the noble&s;&s;e in any other country of Europe. He recalled count Biron, count Munich, and count Le&s;tock, who had been bani&s;hed to Siberia, for their adherence to the In|fant Czar John, &s;on of the prince&s;s of Mecklen|bourg, dethroned at the acce&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t em|pre&s;s.

The&s;e were undoubtedly very popular mea|&s;ures, and would have produced happy effects in his favour, had not they been overbalanced by other parts of his conduct, which &s;avoured &s;trongly of caprice and temerity.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His paci|fic decla|ration to his allies.</NOTE> As early as the month of February, he delivered to the Imperial, French, Poli&s;h, and Swedi&s;h mi|ni&s;ters at Peter&s;burg, a declaration, in writing, ex|pre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ire of putting an end to the effu&s;ion of blood; announcing his readine&s;s to &s;acrifice to this aim the conque&s;ts which the arms of Ru&s;&s;ia had made; exhorting his allies to imitate his mode|ration, and employ all their power to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of Europe.

In con&s;equence of the&s;e events, all the Pru&s;&s;ian troops employed in Pomerania, Brandenburg, and the country of Mecklenburg, were at liberty to join their king in Sile&s;ia, or his brother in Saxony. This was not all the advantage which the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch derived from his treaty with the Czar. The body of Ru&s;&s;ian troops commanded by general Czernichew, which had hitherto acted as auxilia|ries to the Au&s;trians, were ordered to join the Pru&s;|&s;ian army, and this junction was actually effected; &s;o that one compaign &s;aw them &s;erve in oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, committing ho&s;tilities again&s;t their former friends, in favour of tho&s;e whom they had hitherto combated with all the marks of implacable animo|&s;ity.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cam|paign in We&s;t|phalia.</NOTE> In We&s;tphalia, the campaign was al&s;o fruitful of events, and productive of much blood&s;hed, &s;ome of which might have been &s;pared, if more regard had been payed to the dictates of rea&s;on and huma|nity. The de&s;ign of the enemy was to keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of He&s;&s;e, and extend their conque&s;ts into the electorate of Hanover, where they &s;till retained the town of Goettingen, which they had been at great pains and expence to fortify. The bu&s;ine&s;s of prince Ferdinand was to &s;top their progre&s;s, and if po&s;&s;ible, drive them back to the banks of the Mayne.</P>
<P>In the beginning of March, before the armies took the field, a detachment of four thou&s;and men from the French garri&s;on of Goettingen, made a forced march to the po&s;ts of Gittel and Kahlfeldt, in hope of &s;urpri&s;ing the ea&s;t chain of the allied cantonments; but the troops retired from the&s;e places &s;o &s;ea&s;onably, that the enemy could only make a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on their rear, and next day returned to their quarters. Immediately after this attempt, the ea&s;t chain of the allies was &s;trengthen|ed by $word$ $word$ of three thou&s;and men, who took po&s;t at Eimbeck.</P>
<P>In April, general Luckner, a famous Hanoverian parti&s;an, obtained an advantage over the marquis de Lorta$ge, who had marched out of Goettingen, at the head of eighteen hundred hor&s;e and two thou&s;and

About the &s;ame time major Wintzingerode, commander of the He&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars, made a party of French irre|gulars pri&s;oners at Eichsfeld. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month, the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick, at the head of a &s;trong detachment, with a train of ar|tillery, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Aren&s;berg, &s;ituated on one of the heads of the Roer, which the French had occupied, in order to pre&s;erve a communication be|tween their forces on the Rhine, and tho&s;e they had upon the We&s;er. In a few hours after the batteries of the be&s;iegers began to play, the ca&s;tle was &s;et on fire, and the flames raged with &s;uch vio|lence, that mon&s;ieur de Muret, with his garri&s;on of two hundred and thirty men, were obliged to leap over the walls, and &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. After this exploit, the prince made a progre&s;s as far as Elvervelt and Solingen, in the neighbourhood of Du&s;&s;eldorp, and met with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s in levying recruits and contributions.</P>
<P>The French generals, Soubi&s;e and d'E&s;tr&eacute;es, ar|riving at Franckfort in April, a&s;&s;embled their forces in May, on the banks of the We&s;er, while the prince of Cond&eacute; commanded a &s;eparate army at Du&s;&s;el|dorp, on the Lower Rhine. Prince Ferdinand, with the main body of the allies, lay encamped be|hind the Dymel, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the two mar&s;hals; the hereditary prince was po&s;ted with a

The French camp of the mar&s;hals being &s;i uated between Graeben&s;tein and Mein|brexen, prince Ferdinand made a di&s;po&s;ition for attacking them on the twenty-fourth day of June; and the plan was executed acco dingly. General Luckner, leaving his He&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars to amu&s;e prince Xavier and conceal his route, marched from Hollen&s;tadt on the twenty-third in the morn|ing, pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er in the evening, and by three o'clock next morning, formed betwe n Marien|dorff and Udenhau&s;en. At four, general Sporcken pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel at Sielem, with twelve battalions of Hanoverians, and part of the cavalry of the left wing, and advanced between Nombrexen and U|denhau&s;en, with a view to attack the enemy's flank at Carl&s;dorff, while Luckner &s;hould charge them in the rear. At the &s;ame time prince Ferdinand, pa&s;&s;ing the river with twelve Briti&s;h battalions, eleven of the Brun&s;wic troops, eight regiments of He&s;&s;ians, with the Engli&s;h cavalry, and part of the German hor&s;e of the left wing, drew them up, in order, behind the ponds of Kal&s;e. The vanguard on the left was formed by the piquets of the army, and that on the right by the cha&s;&s;eurs of the Eng|l &s;h, and German infantry, commanded by lord Frederick Cavend &s;h, and Freytag's Hanoverian cha&s;&s;eurs, who had orders to &s;eize upon the moun|tain

The marquis of Granby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> who commanded the body of the re&s;erve, pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel at Warburg, and marched by Zierem|berg and Zieber&s;hau&s;en, upon an eminence oppo&s;ite to Fur&s;tenwalde, in order to fall upon the left wing of the enemy. Though they had no intimation of this de&s;ign, until the allies were in &s;ight, mon|&s;ieur de Ca&s;tries, who commanded an advanc|ed po&s;t at Carl&s;dorff, retreated to their main army in good order. The mar&s;hals finding them&s;elves unexpectedly attacked with great impetuo&s;ity in front, &s;lank, and rear, at the &s;ame time, were not a little embarra&s;&s;ed, and &s;oon re&s;olved to retire. Their tents were immediately &s;truck, and they be|gan their retreat, which, con&s;idering the ardour with which they were attacked, would in all proba|bility have ended in a total defeat, had not Mr. de Stainville, at the head of a cho&s;en body, &s;acrificed them to the &s;afety of the army. This gallant officer threw him&s;elf into the woods of Wilhem|&s;tahl, with the grenadiers of France, the royal gre|nadiers, the regiment of Aquitaine, and &s;ome other troops that con&s;tituted the flower of the French in|fantry. With the&s;e he made a noble &s;tand, effectu|ally covering the retreat of the mar&s;hals, who re|tired under the cannon of Ca&s;&s;el, and part of their forces pa&s;&s;ed the Fulda in the utmo&s;t precipitation. Lord Granby attacked the troops of Stainville with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity; and the whole body was either killed or taken, except two battalions that found means to e&s;cape. Upon this occa&s;ion the allies took near three thou&s;and pri&s;oners, including two hundred officers, together with &s;ome &s;tandards

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the ge|nius of prince Ferdi|nand.</NOTE> The war chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in bu&s;h-fighting, the attack of po&s;ts, and &s;urprize of quarters. Were the general's honour at all to be que&s;tioned, one would be apt to think his aim was to protract, ra|ther than to terminate, the mi&s;eries of his country: but, without all doubt, he exerted his be&s;t faculties to bring the war to a conclu&s;ion. It is remarkable of this prince, that he &s;eldom advanced to the ene|my from his own camp, with all his forces a&s;&s;em|bled. All his &s;chemes of attack tended to &s;ur|pri&s;e. He made his di&s;po&s;itions &s;o that the de|tached bodies con&s;tituting his army &s;hould, at an appointed time, move like &s;o many radii from the circumference to the centre, where the attack was to be made; and they had often rivers, mountains, and defiles to pa&s;s: con&s;equently they were &s;ubject to a variety of accidents, any one of which would have been &s;ufficient to di&s;concert the whole de&s;ign. The bridge of a river might break down; or the &s;tream might be rendered un$ordable by a few hours rain. A pa&s;s might be &s;uddenly occupied by the enemy: the breaking down of a waggon in a narrow defile might retard the march of the whole body. If the French generals had been vigilant, they would not have allowed them&s;elves to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed:
<PB N="105" REF="1060">
had they been dextrous in managing their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> private corre&s;pondence, they would have received intimation of the de&s;ign; and, in that ca&s;e, might have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as would have proved fatal to the aggre&s;&s;or: had they changed their po&s;ition, the prince's plan mu&s;t have mi&s;carried: had they advanced to the right or to the left, and met any one detachment of the allies half way, they might have defeated them all &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, before they could &s;u&s;tain each other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Action in the neigh|bourhood of Hom|burg.</NOTE> While the French army remained in their &s;trong camp, under the cannon of Ca&s;&s;el, prince Ferdinand re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to cut off their communication with Franckfort, which was at pre&s;ent maintained by Mr. de Rochambeau, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong po&s;t near Homburg, with a body of hor&s;e and &s;ome brigades of infantry. The marquis of Granby and lord Frederick Cavendi&s;h advanced to di&s;lodge him at the head of the Briti&s;h grena|diers, two regiments of Engli&s;h cavalry, four Ha|noverian &s;quadrons, the cha&s;&s;eurs of the infantry, and the hu&s;&s;ars of Bauer and Riede&s;el. The enemy beginning to retreat as they approached, the mar|quis ordered his hor&s;e to attack their rear, and this &s;ervice was gallantly performed by the regiment of blues and Elliot's dragoons, led on by the colonels Hervey and Er&s;kine: but the French cavalry &s;ud|denly facing about, and falling upon them &s;word in hand, with great re&s;olution, they mu&s;t have been overpowered by &s;uperior number, had not the in|fantry come up to their relief.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdi|nand compels the French army to retire from Mel&s;un|gen.</NOTE> In the month of July, prince Ferdinand formed the re&s;olution of attacking the French mar&s;hals in their camp at Mel&s;ungen, to which place they had fallen back in order to pre&s;erve their communication with Franckfort, and to facilitate their junction with the prince de Cond&eacute;, who had orders to ad|vance from the Lower Rhine for that purpo&s;e. The general of the allied army, having made his u&s;ual expo&s;ition for attacking the enemy, pa&s;&s;ed the Eder on the twenty-fifth, and joined the marquis of Granby on the Heights of Falkenberg: but, ob|&s;erving the po&s;ture of the enemy, he found them too advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted to attack them with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Perceiving, however, that there were &s;igns of confu&s;ion among them, he ad|vanced in columns, and forming at eight in the evening, began to cannonade their camp. At night he retired and repa&s;&s;ed the rivers S$hwalm and Eder, leaving the marquis on the Heights of Falkenberg. At the &s;ame time the enemy pa&s;&s;ed the F$lda, and leaving a body of troops under Mr. de Guerchy, oppo&s;ite to the camp which they abandoned, they retired towards Ca&s;&s;el, while the marquis of Granby took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;t of Mel&s;ungen. Thus their communication with

Francfort &s;eemed to be once more cut off. Their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> conduct at this period appears to have been equally irregular and irre&s;olute. They received a new check in the misfortune of Mr. de Stainville, who, marching with four regiments of dragoons towards Rothenburn, fell into an ambu&s;cade at Mor&s;chen, where his troops were routed and di&s;per&s;ed by a body of troops, under the command of general Freytag. They now abandoned Goettingen, after having demoli&s;hed the fortifications of the place, which they them&s;elves had erected at a very great expence. They &s;ent repeated orders to the prince of Cond&eacute;, to join them without delay; and, in the mean time, they occupied a &s;trong camp on the banks of the Fulda; while prince Ferdinand threw bridges over that river, as if he intended to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of hazarding another attack.

Such was the impetuo&s;ity of the a&s;&s;ailants, that they were &s;oon driven into the plain below; and here the for|tune of the day was immediately changed. They were &s;o con&s;iderably reinforced from their grand army, which had marched from the Fulda to join the prince of Cond&eacute;, that the action was renewed with redoubled vigour, and the allies gave way in their turn. They were obliged to repa&s;s the Wetter with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, the prince him&s;elf being dangerou&s;ly wounded by a mu&s;ket ball that entered his right &s;ide a little above the hip-bone; a con&s;i|derable number were killed on both &s;ides, and about eight hundred of the allies were taken, with &s;even pieces of cannon. Prince Ferdinand no &s;ooner heard that the hereditary prince was engaged, than he marched from his camp, at Nidda, to &s;upport him; and arrived time enough to prevent the enemy from pur&s;uing their advantage. This was the third &s;eparate expedition, in which the hereditary prince proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, &s;ince the beginning of the war.

It was defended by a detachment of two hundred men, the greate&s;t part of whom were po&s;ted in a &s;mall redoubt they had rai&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of September, about &s;ix in the morning, the weather being extremely foggy, the enemy attacked the po&s;t at the Brucker-muhl with mu&s;quetry and &s;ome pieces of cannon, having formed a b dy of ho$&s;e and infantry on the emi|nence beyond the bridge. A cannonade immedi|ately began on both &s;ides, while a warm di&s;pute with &s;mall arms was maintained between the a&s;&s;ail|ants and the Hanoverians, who defended the re|doubt. General Waldegrave, being ordered to &s;upport the Brucker-muhl, detached the fir&s;t bat|talion of Briti&s;h guards to relieve the Hanoverians, who had by this time &s;u&s;ta ned great lo&s;s, and ex|pended all their ammunition. The enemy conti|nuing to throw fre&s;h troops into a &s;mall work, which they had beyond the bridge, and to bring up more cannon; prince Ferdinand al&s;o reinforced his artillery with &s;ix large cannon, and three how|itzers from the army; and four He&s;&s;ian battalions advanced to &s;u&s;tain tho&s;e who were engaged. Both &s;ides fought with the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution, and a prodigious fire of artillery and &s;mall arms was maintained for fourteen hours, without inter|mi&s;&s;ion; yet no attempt was made on either &s;ide to pa&s;s the bridge. At length the darkne&s;s put an end to the action, which co&s;t the allies very near a thou&s;and men killed on the &s;pot The lo&s;s of the enemy greatly exceeded that number. Among the

Dur|ing this very warm di&s;pute, the enemy opened &s;ome batteries again&s;t the ca&s;tle of Amenebourg; and next day, the breach being practicable, threatened to give the a&s;&s;ault, when the commander, being unprovided for further defence, &s;urrendered with his garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war. In con&s;equence of this acqui&s;ition, the enemy advanced the right of their camp, and po&s;ted a &s;trong body of forces be|tween Amenebourg and Kleinfeelheim. As it does not appear that they meant any thing el&s;e by the at|tack at the Brucker-muhl, than to divert the atten|tion of the allies from the defence of Amenebourg; and, as the redoubt was a po&s;t of no con&s;equence, this wanton &s;acrifice of the lives of &s;ome thou&s;ands of brave men, including many gallant officers who peri&s;hed in the action, might have been prevented by withdrawing the Hanoverians from the redoubt when the French advanced to the attack; and the ca&s;tle of Amenebourg, which was of more impor|tance, perhaps would have been &s;aved, if proper di&s;po&s;itions had been made upon that quarter, which &s;eems to have been wholly neglected.</P>

The mar&s;hals of France had their right at Merlan, and their left at Caldern. This was the period at which the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el was undertaken. The trenches were opened on the &s;ixteenth day of October; and the operations pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch vigour, that, not|with&s;tanding the activity and re&s;olution of a very numerous garri&s;on, headed by the baron de Di$&s;|bach, they were obliged to capitulate on the fir&s;t day of November, and marched out with all the honours of war.

We will venture to affirm, that the fate of the town could not, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, influence the ar|ticles of the peace, which were, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;ettled before the &s;iege was undertaken.

He was ac|cu&s;ed of having di&s;carded the faithful &s;ervants of the crown; of having introduced a &s;y&s;tem of To$yi&s;m in the cabinet; and of having a&s;&s;ociated bad men, weak politicians, and ignorant financiers, into his admini&s;tration: he was taxed with pride, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and partiality. Every trifle was &s;welled up into a capital charge again&s;t him: even the ac|cidents of fortune were imputed as guilt to the mini&s;ter. His being created knight of the garter, with one of the king's brothers, was magnified as a flagrant in&s;tance of his vanity and in&s;olence.

The earl of Bute was not only a <HI>Stuart</HI> by name, but he had the misfortune to be born a native of North Britain; and this very circum|&s;tance, we will venture to &s;ay, was, in the opinion of the people, more than &s;ufficient to counter|balance all the good qualities which human nature could po&s;&s;e&s;s.

They demon&s;trated the dangers that threatened the intere&s;ts of Old England, from the great numbers of tho&s;e Northern adventurers, who had wriggled them&s;elves into all the different de|partments of civil and military in&s;titution; and they in&s;i&s;ted upon the di&s;grace of acquie&s;cing under the government of a North Briton, a Stuart allied by blood to the pretender, who had expelled from court the be&s;t friends of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with avowed Tories, who pro&s;ti|tuted the offices, and &s;quandered away the wealth of England on worthle&s;s favourites of his own country.

This &s;tep was taken in order to &s;ecure a footing on both quarters of the town, and divide the enemy's attention, &s;o as to weaken the defence of the Moro, again&s;t which the earl of Albemarle had determined to di|rect his chief operations.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attack of Fort Moro.</NOTE> Fa&s;cines, &s;tores, and artillery, being landed from the &s;hips with great expedition by the &s;eamen, the engineers began to erect batteries of bombs and cannon, while a body of pioneers were employed to cut parallels in the woods, and form a line with fa&s;cines to &s;ecure the guards from the fire of the enemy, which began to be very trouble&s;ome. On the twenty-ninth, about one thou&s;and cho&s;en men of the enemy, with a detachment of armed negroes and mulattoes, landed on two divi&s;ions to the right and left of the Moro, in order to de&s;troy the works of the be&s;iegers: but they were repul&s;ed by the piquets and advanced po&s;ts, and retreated in great confu&s;ion, with the lo&s;s of two hundred men, killed and taken. On the fir&s;t day of July, the be&s;iegers opened two batteries of cannon, &s;o that their whole fire now proceeded from twelve battering cannon, &s;ix large mortars, three &s;mall ones, and twenty-&s;ix royals. The enemy had &s;eventeen pieces of ar|tillery, and one mortar, mounted on the front at|tacked: but their fire was not &s;o well maintained as that of the a&s;&s;ailants.

They &s;uffered con|&s;iderably in their rigging, and lo&s;t a great num|ber of men, including captain Goo&s;trey, who fell in the beginning of the engagement. His place was &s;upplied by captain Lind&s;ay of the Trent, a brave officer, who behaved with remarkable gal|lantry.

Mean while, the enemy made &s;uch a vigorous defence, that the &s;iege was pro|tracted beyond expectation; a con&s;iderable delay was likewi&s;e occa&s;ioned by an unlucky accident. On the third day of July, the principal battery of the be&s;iegers, chiefly con&s;tructed of timber and fa&s;|cines, being dried by the heat of the weather and the continual cannonade, took fire, and the flames raged with &s;uch violence, that almo&s;t the whole work was con&s;umed. The be&s;iegers were &s;ubjected to various other di&s;couragements. Epidemical di&s;tempers, &s;uch as never fail to attack the natives of Britain who vi&s;it tho&s;e countries, began to make great havock, both in the army and the navy. The&s;e were rendered more fatal by the want of nece&s;&s;aries and refre&s;hments. The provi&s;ion was bad; and the troops were ill &s;upplied with water. The great number of the &s;ick rendered the duty more fatiguing to tho&s;e that were well. In tho&s;e warm climates, the human body being in a &s;tate of relaxation, is incapable of &s;uch a degree of labour as it can bear in more northern latitudes; and the men are &s;ubject to a &s;pecies of dejection, which al|ways augments the general mortality: this was now reinforced by the delay of the troops from North America, which they had long expected to no purpo&s;e.</P>

The only place by which the foot of the wall was acce&s;&s;ible, happened to be a thin ridge of rock, left at the point of the ba&s;tion, to cover the extremity of the ditch, which would otherwi&s;e have been open to the &s;ea. Along this ridge the miners pa&s;&s;ed, without cover, to the foot of the wall, where they made a lodgment with little lo&s;s.

In the night of the twenty-fir&s;t, a &s;erjeant and twelve men &s;caled the walls by &s;ur|prize; but, the garri&s;on being alarmed before they could be &s;u&s;tained, they were obliged to retreat with precipitation. Next day, at four in the morning, a &s;ally was made from the town, by fifteen hundred men, divided into three detachments, who attacked the be&s;iegers in three different places, while a warm fire was kept up in their favour from the fort of Punta, the we&s;t ba&s;tion, the lines and flanks of the entrance, and their &s;hipping in the harbour.

Their lo&s;s amounted to four hundred, killed and taken pri&s;oners. On the thirtieth day of the month, about two in the morn|ing, a floating battery was towed out into the har|bour, and fired with grape-&s;hot and &s;mall arms into the ditch, though without any great interruption to the miners; and the clo&s;e fire of the covering party &s;oon compelled the enemy to retire.</P>

The troops mounted with great intrepidity, and, forming on the top of the breach, drove the enemy from every part of the ramparts, after a &s;hort, though very warm, di&s;pute, in which about one hundred and thirty Spaniards were killed, including &s;everal officers of di&s;tinction.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Surrender of the Havanna and Spani&s;h &s;hipping.</NOTE> The reduction of the Moro was not immediately attended with the &s;urrender of the Havanna; on the contrary, the governor of the place now di|rected his chief fire again&s;t the fortre&s;s which they had lo&s;t; and even &s;ent down a large &s;hip of the line to the entrance of the harbour, from whence &s;he could batter it with more effect. Her efforts, however, produced nothing, and in a few hours &s;he removed to a greater di&s;tance. In the mean time, general Keppel, with the advice of the engi|neer, re&s;olved to erect new batteries on the Ca|vannos; and a plan was formed for making a new attack to the we&s;tward of the town. On the tenth of Augu&s;t, in the morning, the batteries on the Cavannos being fini&s;hed, the earl of Albemarle &s;ent a flag of truce to &s;ummon the governor to &s;urrender; and his an&s;wer was, that he would de|fend the place to the la&s;t extremity.

About two in the afternoon, white flags were hung out all round the place, as well as on board the ad|miral's &s;hip in the harbour; and, in a little time, a flag of truce arrived at the head-quarters, with propo&s;als of capitulation. The governor &s;tickled hard to obtain permi&s;&s;ion to &s;end the &s;hips to Spain, and to have the harbour declared neutral; but

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> neither of the&s;e points could be given up, and ho&s;ti|lities were ordered to be renewed, when the enemy thought proper to recede from their demands. By the capitulation, which was &s;igned on the thirteenth, the inhabitants were &s;ecured in their private pro|perty, in the enjoyment of their own laws and reli|gion; and next day the Engli&s;h troops took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this important conque&s;t. As for the Spani&s;h garri&s;on, which amounted to about nine hundred, including officers, they were indulged with the honours of war; and it was &s;tipulated, that they and the &s;ailors &s;hould be conveyed to Old Spain, together with the Spani&s;h commodore, the governor of the Havanna, the viceroy of Peru, and the governor of Carthagena. In the progre&s;s of the &s;iege, about five hundred of the Briti&s;h troops, including fifteen officers, were killed out-right or died of their wounds; and about &s;even hundred, comprehending thirty-nine officers, were cut off by di&s;temper, which raged with redoubled violence after the reduction of the place.

voice of many, who, in other re&s;pects, had no ob|jection<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> to the per&s;on of the mini&s;ter. With re&s;pect to the articles of the peace, which were now pretty well known, though the preliminaries had not been formally &s;igned, many papers and pamphlets were written and publi&s;hed on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. It was taken for granted that great part of the Briti&s;h conque&s;ts would be re&s;tored; therefore la|boured compari&s;ons were drawn between Canada and the French &s;ugar i&s;lands, in which the im|portance of each was magnified or depreciated with all the artifice of mi&s;repre&s;entation, according to the intere&s;ted views of the different authors who drew their pens upon this occa&s;ion. Whether it was nece&s;&s;ary to give up the conquered i&s;lands, we &s;hall not pretend to determine; but tho&s;e who ar|gued for re&s;toring Canada, rather than Guadalupe, were either extremely ignorant of the true intere&s;ts of Great Britain, or influenced by motives of pri|vate advantage, which they re&s;olved to obey at the hazard of &s;owing the &s;eeds of a new war in North-America: for, exclu&s;ive of the commercial ad|vantages immediately derived from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, that is, the entire fur trade of a va&s;t continent, it effectually &s;ecured the Briti&s;h colonies in that part of the world, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;afe while the French retained their &s;ettle|ments on the lakes, the river and gulph of St. Laurence.</P>

France and Spain declared, in plain terms, that, without the re&s;titution of the i&s;lands and the Havanna, peace could be of no advantage to them; that they would rather hazard the pro&s;ecution of the war, which, in the long run, mu&s;t exhau&s;t the finances and credit of England; and, in the mean time, redouble their efforts in making an entire conque&s;t of Portugal, which it would not be in the power of the Briti&s;h auxiliaries to protect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prelimi|naries &s;igned.</NOTE> Perhaps the m&mdash;y of Great Britain di&s;covered an eagerne&s;s for peace in the negotiation, which en|couraged the courts of Ver&s;ailles and Madrid to in&s;i&s;t upon more favourable terms than, otherwi&s;e, they would have been glad to embrace. Be that as it may, the preliminaries were &s;igned on both &s;ides, and interchanged at Ver&s;ailles about the latter end of November: an event which was im|mediately communicated to the city of London, by a letter from the under-&s;ecretary of &s;tate, to the lord-mayor. The capital was &s;till in a ferment, which the chief magi&s;trate took very little pains to allay. The oppo&s;ition had been gathering &s;trength ever &s;ince the negotiation was renewed.

their re&s;pective parti&s;ans. It is certain that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> former, for &s;ome time, had been no friend to that mini&s;ter's mea&s;ures. He &s;aw his own importance dwindle by the continuance of the war, in propor|tion as it was &s;ucce&s;sful. He &s;ecretly encouraged the attacks that were made upon Mr. P&mdash;tt's mea|&s;ures, and, had not lord B&mdash;e &s;tept in, he him&s;elf would have headed the pacific &s;y&s;tem. But they were far le&s;s di&s;united from one another than each was to lord B&mdash;e. At la&s;t common enmity unit|ed them, and they joined their endeavours to per&s;uade the people that the p&mdash;t would never ratify the conditions of &s;uch an infamous peace. On the other hand, the members of the admini&s;tration did not fail to take every proper mea&s;ure that could en&s;ure the approbation of the legi&s;lature. By this time the earl of Hallifax was joined with the earl of Egremont, as &s;e|cretary of &s;tate; and Mr. Grenville was placed at the head of the admiralty. Mr. F&mdash;x exerted him|&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully in &s;ecuring the concurrence of many individuals in the lower hou&s;e; and almo&s;t the whole landed intere&s;t was well affected to the mea|&s;ures of the government.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> for peace. He gave them to unde$&s;tand, that the preliminary articles were actually &s;igned: that, by the cond$tions in which all parties had acquie&s;ced, an immen&s;e territo$y was added to the empire of Great Britain; and a &s;o$id foundation laid for the increa&s;e of commerce; that care had been taken to remove all occa&s;ions of future di&s;putes; that the king of Portugal was &s;ecured in all his domi|nions; and that all the territories of his German allies were evacuated by the troops of France. He lamented that a great number of his &s;ubjects had been lo&s;t in different parts of the world; a con&s;i|deration which reinforced the other rea&s;ons he had to engage in the negotiation; and that he had ha&s;tened the conclu&s;ion of it, to prevent the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of making preparations for another cam|paign. He de&s;ired the commons to con&s;ider of &s;uch methods in the &s;ettlement of the new acqui&s;i|tions, as &s;hould mo&s;t effectually tend to the &s;ecu|rity of tho&s;e countries, and to the improvement of the Briti&s;h trade and navigation. He recommend|ed to their care and attention, his gallant &s;ubjects by who&s;e valour tho&s;e acqui&s;itions were made. He ob&s;erved, that union at home was peculiarly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to lay the foundation of that oeconomy which they owed to them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, and which alone could relieve the nation from the heavy burthens entailed upon it by the nece&s;&s;ities of a long expen&s;ive war.</P>

next day a ce&s;&s;ation of arms was proclaimed; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> orders were given for opening again all the chan|nels of communication with France and Spain.

That nobleman defended his own con|duct with temper and decorum, in a well connected &s;peech delivered with great propriety, to the &s;ur|prize of many who did not think him &s;o well qua|lified in the art and faculty of elocution. He gave a detail of the negotiation; and not only owned him&s;elf a warm promoter of the peace, but even expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that this circum&s;tance &s;hould be engraved upon his tomb He was &s;econded by the earl of Halifax, and &s;upported by a great ma|jority.</P>
<P>The &s;ame good fortune attended the admini&s;tra|tion in the other hou&s;e, where the oppo&s;ition made its appearance in a number that was by no means formidable. Mr. P&mdash;tt, though in his health greatly indi&s;po&s;ed, re&s;olved to di&s;approve the peace in per|&s;on. He came into the hou&s;e, &s;upported on the arms of his friends, and obtained of the &s;peaker permi&s;&s;ion to harangue &s;itting. In this attitude he &s;poke above two hours without intermi&s;&s;ion. The &s;cope of his &s;peech was to ju&s;tify his own con|duct in the admini&s;tration; and to give his opinion of the &s;eparate articles of the peace, which, upon the whole, he condemned as inadequate to the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms. It is true he him&s;elf had

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Ob&s;erva|tions on the trea|ty.</NOTE> The reader will, at one glance, perceive that the&s;e terms are more advantageous to Great Britain and her allies, than tho&s;e which were agreed to by the late mini&s;ter. He mu&s;t determine for him&s;elf, whether they were &s;uch as &s;he ought to have in&s;i&s;t|ed upon, in con&s;equence of her additional &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Certainly they were more favourable for France and Spain, than tho&s;e powers could have rea&s;onably ex|pected to enjoy, after the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained. It mu&s;t be acknowledged that Great Britain, by extending the frontiers of Canada, to the middle of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, gained a large tract of fertile country lying on the banks of that river, be&s;ides the advantage of a free navigation upon it, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the port of Mobile: but, in order to &s;ecure the Engli&s;h American colonies from all po&s;|&s;ibility of di&s;turbance from the French, that re&s;t|le&s;s nation ought to have been expelled from New Orleans, and the whole country of Loui&s;iana; for, while they remain in this &s;ettlement, at liberty to penetrate by the river to the remote tribes of In|dians, they will &s;till maintain their influence among tho&s;e &s;avages: they will &s;upply them with nece&s;&s;aries, con&s;equently weaken their dependence upon the Engli&s;h; and employ their arts of in&s;i|nuation upon them &s;o effectually, as to have it al|ways in their power to hunt them upon the de|fencele&s;s back-&s;ettlements of the Briti&s;h coloni&s;ts. It does not appear that the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were well acquainted with the importance of this article.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="1930">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> England, by this peace, likewi&s;e gained an ac|ce&s;&s;ion, in France's ceding to her the i&s;land of Gre|nada, which, when fully cultivated and peopled, may be of &s;ome con&s;equence. She moreover ac|quired the un&s;ettled i&s;lands of Dominica, Tobago, and St. Vincent; but yielded to France the i&s;land of St. Lucie, &s;aid to be worth all the re&s;t. She retains the &s;ettlement of Senegal on the coa&s;t of Africa, by which &s;he engro&s;&s;es the whole gum trade of that country; as for the rock of Goree, which &s;he re&s;tored, it was no great &s;acrifice. The article that relates to the Ea&s;t-Indies, was dictated by the directors of the Engli&s;h company; and &s;urely the French have no rea&s;on to complain of its &s;everity, as it re&s;tores them to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the places they had at the beginning of the war, on condition that they &s;hall maintain neither forts nor forces in the kingdom of Bengal; thus they will enjoy all their former advantages in trade, without the temp|tation and expence of forming &s;chemes of conque&s;t and dominion.</P>
<P>The demolition of the works belonging to the harbour of Dunkirk, is no doubt a &s;en&s;ible morti|fication to France, though of little con&s;equence to England, while a &s;quadron of &s;hips is kept at an|chor in the Downs. It became an object of &s;ome con&s;ideration in the war of queen Anne, as a ne&s;t of privateers that infe&s;ted the channel; and was after|wards u&s;ed as an inflammatory term of faction. The danger that may threaten England from Dunkirk, does not depend upon ve&s;&s;els which could be received into the harbour; but mu&s;t ari&s;e from a &s;trong &s;quadron of &s;hips of the line, which
<PB N="188" REF="1940">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> may always lie at anchor in the road. It is un|doubtedly in the power of France to embark twenty thou&s;and men on the coa&s;t of Calais and Dunkirk; and the&s;e, taking the advantage of a &s;trong ea&s;terly wind, which will not allow the Bri|ti&s;h &s;quadron in the Downs to move from their riding, may, under convoy of ten &s;ail of the line, reach the mouth of the river Thames, in fourteen hours. Tilbury fort, oppo&s;ite to Grave&s;end, which is the only &s;trength that guards the channel, might be &s;ilenced in two hours, by two or three &s;hips of the line; and then the whole armament might proceed to Blackwall, without further oppo&s;ition. Every lover of his country mu&s;t be &s;hocked at the thoughts of what would happen, if twenty thou&s;and French troops, with the pretender at their head, &s;hould land within &s;ix miles of the capital. In two hours he would be joined by an equal number of parti&s;ans, in arms, either induced by affection to his family, or in&s;tigated by the hope of plunder. From that moment, public credit would fail; and London be obliged to receive law from the invader. This dreadful picture we draw by way of caution to the government, which may ea&s;ily prevent any &s;uch di&s;a&s;ter, by fortifying the rivers Thames and Medway, on both &s;ides, at tho&s;e places where their channels are the mo&s;t ea&s;ily commanded, and keep|ing a &s;trong &s;quadron of &s;hips always ready for &s;er|vice, at the Nore, or in the harbour of Sheerne&s;s. Granting that &s;uch an inva&s;ion was attended with much greater difficulty, it will be the intere&s;t of France, upon certain occa&s;ions, to &s;acrifice twenty thou&s;and men meerly to try the experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="1950">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> As the treaty makes no mention of the &s;hips taken from the &s;ubjects of France before the de|claration of war, in all probability, the king of Great Britain agreed that their owners &s;hould be indemnified; a conce&s;&s;ion which barely attones for a mea&s;ure which (whatever may have been alledged in its ju&s;tification) will always be con&s;idered by the candid and impartial, as an act of violence and ra|pine, that &s;trikes at the very root of the law of na|tions, which, for the intere&s;ts of humanity in gene|ral, ought to be held &s;acred, even amid&s;t the warme&s;t tran&s;ports of animo&s;ity and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The liberty of cutting logwood in the bay of Honduras, granted to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, was undoubtedly a great point gained in their fa|vour; but their obliging them&s;elves to demoli&s;h their fortifications on that coa&s;t, was a tacit acknowledg|ment that the privilege was not founded upon right, but derived from favour. His catholic maje&s;ty's renouncing all preten&s;ions in favour of his &s;ubjects, to the right of fi&s;hing on the coa&s;ts of Newfound|land, was a puny &s;acrifice, &s;omething in appearance, but nothing in reality: for the claim was almo&s;t as ob&s;olete as that of the Engli&s;h monarch to the do|minions of France. The ce&s;&s;ion of Florida, with the forts of St. Augu&s;tine and Pen&s;acola, to Great Britain, was an object of much greater importance. It extended the Briti&s;h dominions along the coa&s;t to the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. It removed an a&s;ylum for the &s;laves of the Engli&s;h colonies, who were continually making their e&s;cape to St. Au|gu&s;tine. It deprived the Spaniards of an ea&s;y ave|nue, through which they had it in their power to
<PB N="190" REF="1960">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> invade Georgia and Carolina; it afforded a large extent of improveable territory, a &s;trong frontier, and a good port in the bay of Mexico, both for the convenience of trade, and the annoyance of the Spaniards in any future conte&s;t. But neither the ce&s;&s;ion of Florida, nor the renunciation of the right to the fi&s;hery, nor the permi&s;&s;ion granted to the Engli&s;h logwood cutters, nor the evacuation of Portugal; nor all the&s;e articles together, can ever be e&s;teemed equivalent to the re&s;titution of the Havanna; for which, indeed, the Spani&s;h monarch had no &s;uitable compen&s;ation to make, without di&s;membring his kingdom, unle&s;s he had thrown into the &s;cale with his other conce&s;&s;ions, that of a free navigation, without &s;earch, to the Briti&s;h tra|ders on the coa&s;t of New Spain. This was an ad|vantage with which the people of England flattered their own imaginations: but it was a privilege which the court of Madrid could not grant, without opening the avenues of a contraband trade between the Engli&s;h and Spani&s;h creoles, which would have been fatal to the commerce of Old Spain: becau&s;e, in that ca&s;e, his catholic maje&s;ty's American &s;ub|jects would have &s;upplied them&s;elves at the fir&s;t hand, with European commodities, from the trad|ing &s;hips of Great Britain; and great part of the wealth of that country would have been conveyed immediately to England.</P>
<P>The crown of Spain was much favoured by the article which &s;tipulates, that the conque&s;ts, not in|cluded in the treaty either as ce&s;&s;ions or re&s;titutions, &s;hou d be re&s;tored without compen&s;ation. Neither France nor Spain had any armament on foot, from
<PB N="191" REF="1970">
which they could expect the lea&s;t acqui&s;ition or<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> &s;ucce&s;s; whereas the mini&s;try of England had great rea&s;on to believe that the i&s;land of Luconia was al|ready reduced.</P>
<P>On the whole, the treaty, tho' perhaps it might have been more favourable in &s;ome articles, certainly con|firmed great and &s;olid advantages to Great Britain; and will remain as an eternal monument of that moderation which forms the mo&s;t amiable flower in the wreath of conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the public was in &s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning the terms of the peace, the conduct of the We&s;t-Indian intere&s;t in parliament, the lead of which the lord-mayor of London a&s;&s;umed, was very remarkable. Tho&s;e coloni&s;ts, at this time, made no incon&s;iderable figure in the hou&s;e of commons, and, before the fate of the peace was determined, they omitted neither pains nor expence to per&s;uade the public that it was far more eligible for Great Britain to give up Martinico and Guadaloupe than Canada. Their rea&s;on for this was plain, becau&s;e the retention of tho&s;e i&s;lands mu&s;t have dimini&s;hed their own importance, and the clamorous efforts they made to render their own voice that of the pub|lic, had, undoubtedly, &s;ome weight with the mi|ni&s;try. But no &s;ooner did tho&s;e patriots perceive, that the ce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e i&s;lands was the mea&s;ure e&s;pou&s;ed by lord B&mdash;e, and that it was in a man|ner irrevocable in the negotiation, than they joined heartily in the oppo&s;ition to the whole &s;y&s;tem of the peace. This incon&s;i&s;tent behaviou$ gave the greater di&s;gu&s;t to wi&s;e and con&s;iderate per&s;ons, as it was well known that the former mini&s;ter had,
<PB N="192" REF="1980">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> again&s;t his own &s;entiments, bought the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e coloni&s;ts at the &s;ame price.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace in Germa|ny.</NOTE> France and England, having mutually with|drawn them&s;elves from the war in Germany, the courts of Vienna and Berlin began to think in earne&s;t of an accommodation. The empre&s;s queen had but little hopes of prevailing, by her own &s;trength alone, again&s;t a prince who had &s;o long with&s;tood the joint efforts of &s;o many powerful confederates. On the other hand, the k&mdash;g of P&mdash;a had no more &s;ub&s;idies to expect from Great Britain, and little more to gain by contribution and compul&s;ion in the provinces of Germany, which he had already, in a great mea&s;ure, depopulated and impoveri&s;hed. Perhaps he was &s;ick of a war, which, in &s;pite of all his activity and &s;ucce&s;s, had expo&s;ed him to incredible fatigue, and repeated mortification. Both parties having expre&s;&s;ed a de|fire of peace, conferences were opened at Hubert&s;|burg, by the Au&s;trian, Pru&s;&s;ian, and Poli&s;h pleni|potentiaries; and the articles were, in a little time, adju&s;ted. The treaties of pacification between the&s;e powers imported, that the troops on all &s;ides &s;hould be withdrawn from the countries which had been invaded and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the war; that peace &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed on the footing of former treaties, and each party &s;it down quietly with the lo&s;s it had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Such was the i&s;&s;ue of a war, &s;anguinary beyond example, which had raged with uncommon fury in the four quarters of the globe; which had ruined many fair provinces; and, in the &s;pace of &s;even years, de&s;troyed above a million of lives; which
<PB N="193" REF="1990">
had co&s;t Great Britain, in particular, above two<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> hundred and eighty thou&s;and men, including a great number of brave and able officers, with an incredible quantity of trea&s;ure; and increa&s;ed the burthen of her national debt, from four&s;core, to one hundred and thirty millions &s;terling.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of parlia|ment.</NOTE> We &s;hall now proceed to the tran&s;actions of par|liament, e&s;pecially &s;uch as mo&s;t &s;trongly attracted the public attention. Oeconomy was the avowed plan of government, and the mini&s;try laid it down as a rule of their conduct, to retrench all the expences which had been been lavi&s;hed during the two late reigns, for &s;upporting the parliamentary intere&s;t of the court. The&s;e, upon enquiry, were found to be extravagant almo&s;t beyond belief, as a chain of venal dependency reached from the highe&s;t mini&s;ter down to the meane&s;t dome&s;tic, each being allowed, without enquiry or examination, to accu|mulate, in the mo&s;t &s;hameful manner, profits and perqui&s;ites amounting often to ten times the value of their regulated appointments. The reformation<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reforma|tion of the royal hou&s;hold.</NOTE> of this extravagancy, and tho&s;e impo&s;itions which, in&s;tead of contributing to the dignity and &s;upport of government, deba&s;ed and weakened it, occa&s;i|oned an outcry from the numerous dependants of the late mini&s;ters, who pleaded practice and pre|&s;cription in their favour; and many of them com|plained that they had bought their po&s;ts from their &s;uperiors in office, and that therefore they had a right to make as much of them as they could. But even this reformation was performed with an equi|table hand: the lawful wages of tho&s;e who were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="194" REF="2000">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> were continued, even though their attend|ance and &s;ervices were not required.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficul|ties in rai&s;ing the &s;up|ply.</NOTE> The &s;avings by this mea&s;ure, great as they were, were inadequate to the nece&s;&s;ities of the public, and therefore it was found nece&s;&s;ary to have re|courle to &s;ome national method of &s;upply. The more this affair was con&s;idered, the more difficult it appeared. The duties upon malt and publicans could not be extended without public di&s;tre&s;s and danger. The nece&s;&s;aries, conveniences, and luxu|ries of life, were already taxed to the utmo&s;t they could bear, nor could the able&s;t financier in the kingdom point out an object that admitted of an additional burden. This difficulty had been fore|&s;een and owned by the late mini&s;ters, when they planned the unpopular additional tax upon beer. The new mini&s;try would have willingly taken their advice upon this &s;ubject, but they maintained a &s;ullen re&s;erve. The chancellor of the exchequer, within who&s;e department the bu&s;ine&s;s of financing lies, had been put into that office from the opinion the mini&s;ter entertained of his hone&s;ty rather than his abilities, which, in the art of rai&s;ing &s;upplies, are chiefly acquired by experience. The difficul|ties of the government were encrea&s;ed by the re|peated declarations they had made, that a peace was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to lighten the pre&s;&s;ures of the people: without, perhaps, &s;ufficiently con&s;ider|ing, that money is equally nece&s;&s;ary at the conclu|&s;ion, as in the middle, of a war, that the purpo&s;es of a peace may be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways and means propo&s;ed.</NOTE> To rai&s;e the money nece&s;&s;ary, it was propo&s;ed to take from the &s;inking-fund two millions; by
<PB N="195" REF="2010">
loans and exchequer bills, one million eight hun|dred<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> thou&s;and pounds; by annuities and two lot|teries three millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds. Nothing could be more defen&s;ible than this plan of &s;upply; and to defray the intere&s;t of tho&s;e loans, which amounted to &s;even million three hundred thou&s;and pounds, an additional duty of eight pounds a ton was laid on French wines, and four pounds a ton on all other wines. No oppo&s;ition was made to tho&s;e impo&s;ts; but a duty of a very different kind<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duty up|on cyder.</NOTE> this &s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed into a law; it was that for impo&s;ing upon every hog&s;head of cyder a tax of four &s;hillings, to be paid by the maker; and, with certain qualifi|cations, to be &s;ubjected to all the laws of exci&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppo&s;iti|on to it.</NOTE> No &s;ooner was this unpopular tax propo&s;ed, than oppo&s;ition unma&s;ked all its batteries, and attacked the whole plan of the &s;upplies. Its patrons maintain|ed, in direct contradiction to the mini&s;try, and many of them to their own former declarations, that to re|pre&s;ent the nation as exhau&s;ted, was advancing a fal|lacy; that the war had paid for it&s;elf; that &s;upplies for continuing it for two years might ea&s;ily be rai&s;ed; that the nation never at any time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much wealth, or contained &s;o many rich individuals, as it did at that very time; that all pretences towards oeconomy were fordid and futile; and that no plan of frugality could have any &s;en&s;ible operation towards the payment of the public debts, but that it might terminate in lo&s;s and di&s;grace. The lottery-plan was objected to as encouraging the &s;pirit of gam|ing, and giving an immen&s;e profit to the &s;ub&s;crib|ers. The loan from the &s;inking-fund, that &s;acred
<PB N="196" REF="2020">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> depo&s;it, was exclaimed again&s;t as only po&s;tponing the evil day, and tending to load po&s;terity with ad|ditional burdens.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e objections came with no great weight from gentlemen, who, when they and their friends were in the admini&s;tration, had complained of the difficulties of financing, had e&s;tabli&s;hed the practice of lotteries, which, on all hands, were admitted to be nece&s;&s;ary evils, and had given the greate&s;t blows to the &s;inking-fund it ever had received. But the chief matter of declamation again&s;t the mini&s;|try aro&s;e from the cyder-tax. The oppo&s;ition en|deavoured to &s;hew that in its plan, execution, and con&s;equences, it was dangerous to the public tran|quility; and, in &s;hort, that it might rai&s;e a rebelli|ous &s;pirit in tho&s;e counties it was to affect. It was &s;i&s;ted upon, that it was partial and oppre&s;&s;ive, be|cau&s;e it laid a burden, that ought to be national, up|on cyder-makers only.

The more refined rea&s;on|ers again&s;t this duty urged, that from the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;um to be rai&s;ed, it appeared evidently that the true object of the government was to gain a precedent which might extend the odious in&s;titu|tion of exci&s;es to every branch of trade and manu|factures, and con&s;equently increa&s;e the influence of the crown, to the de&s;truction of the properties of the people, and at la&s;t to the ruin of their liber|ties.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wered by the friends of the go|vern|ment.</NOTE> Such, dive&s;ted of the u&s;ual ornaments of decla|mation and local con&s;iderations, were the argu|ments made u&s;e of again&s;t the mini&s;try on the cyder tax. They and their friends, however, were not wanting to them&s;elves, and repelled the attack with &s;uperior &s;trength of rea&s;oning.

As taxes mu&s;t fall upon the poor equally as the rich, they con|tended that it was ridiculous to mention the wealth of individuals in that que&s;tion, unle&s;s it was propo&s;|ed to renew the practices of privy &s;eal loans, free-gifts, and capitation taxes. They maintained that it was ab&s;urd to think of impo&s;ing mo e taxes, or borrowing more money, without extreme nece&s;&s;ity. That every tax mu&s;t be attended with &s;ome incon|veniency, and that the duty propo&s;ed upon cyder was the mo&s;t equal and the lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive of any that could be mentioned. They appealed to the heads of the oppo&s;ition, whether the cyder counties had ever paid in any adequate proportion to the public taxes with the malting counties, where the exci&s;e has no &s;uch exemptions in favour of the poor, as were propo&s;ed in the cyder bill; and that even the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argu|ments in favour of the ex|ci&s;e.</NOTE> They offered to comply with any other mode of collection be&s;ides that of exci&s;e; but they clearly demon&s;trated that, if cyder was admitted to be a &s;it object for a tax, the exci&s;e was undoubtedly the me|thod of collecting it, the mo&s;t ea&s;y for the people, and the mo&s;t advantageous for the government.

But that was far from being the ca&s;e; for it was confined to the cyder counties, from whence it was communicated to the common-council of London, whom the tax could never affect in any degree worth mentioning. Future times, perhaps, may do ju&s;tice to the integrity of the mini&s;try, when it is con&s;idered that the counties which were to pay this tax, had been always zealou&s;ly atrached to the principles upon which the new government acted, and remarkably aver&s;e to the mea&s;ures of the two la&s;t reigns.</P>

Mini&s;terial greatne&s;s was no object for a nobleman of his turn of mind, and circum&s;tances of fortune.

The death of lord Egremont, in Au|gu&s;t this year, occa&s;ioned a remove in the mini&s;try, and the earl of Sandwich, who had been appointed to go amba&s;&s;ador to Spain, &s;ucceeded him as &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, and the earl of Egmont was appoint|ed fir&s;t lord of the admiralty.

This, how|ever, did not prevent the &s;ame &s;ailors from patrol|ling, in a tumultuous manner, through We&s;tmin|&s;ter, and they carried their petitions to his maje&s;ty; but they were referred to the lords of the ad|miralty, who promi&s;ed to do them ju&s;tice, and to recommend to favour all who &s;hould appear to de|&s;erve it. This lenity was far from quelling the out|rage among the &s;ailors, who now threatened the magi&s;trates in the execution of their office. Upon enquiry it was found, that they were &s;pirited up by a number of lewd women, who were harboured about Tower-Hill, Wapping, and that neighbour|hood, and who were protected by the &s;ailors again&s;t the con&s;tables, who were &s;ent by the ju&s;tices of the peace of that divi&s;ion to apprehend them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e,</NOTE> One Rice, an exchange-broker, of a fair charac|ter in trade, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be of a con&s;iderable fortune, had been entru&s;ted by a lady to receive

her dividends of South-&s;ea &s;tock, and to &s;end it to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> her in the country. During the negotiations for peace, the various turns they met with encouraged a &s;pirit of gaming in Exchange&punc;alley, e&s;pecially among the brokers, &s;ome of whom, and Rice among the re&s;t, &s;uffered largely by the fluctuation of the &s;tocks. Dreading the lo&s;s of credit, he forged a letter of attorney from this lady, impowering him to &s;ell her &s;tock, to the amount of 5000 l. and it is &s;aid he practi&s;ed the &s;ame fraud upon others of his employers, without their &s;u&s;pecting the matter, as he regularly tran&s;mitted them their dividends, and &s;ometimes even replaced the &s;tock. His lo&s;&s;es multiplying, he was unable to remain longer with|out detection, e&s;pecially as he under&s;tood that the lady whom he had defrauded was coming up to town, and would infallibly di&s;cover the forgery. The remains of his fortune, be&s;ides his furniture and equipages, which were very elegant, amounted to five thou&s;and four hundred pounds, five thou|&s;and of which he depo&s;ited with his wife, in bank|bills, and privately withdrew, with the remainder, to Harwich, from whence he procured a pa&s;&s;age to Holland, leaving orders with his wife, who ra|ther &s;u&s;pected, than knew, his circum&s;tances, to fol|low him. She accordingly took &s;hipping for Hol|land, but being forced back to Harwich, &s;he fell into the hands of tho&s;e who were in pur&s;uit of her hu&s;band. Being brought up to London, and ex|amined before the lord-mayor, &s;he readily gave up the bank-notes that were in her hands, to the amount of four thou&s;and &s;even hundred pounds.

<P>The crime committed by Rice was of the mo&s;t dangerous tendency, e&s;pecially in a commercial country, and indeed became a common concern to all the traders in Europe, who had any connecti|ons of credit. The Engli&s;h government thought the offence of &s;uch a nature, that no local protection was due to the offender, and the place of his retreat was &s;oon di&s;covered by a letter which he wrote to his agent, who immediately carried it to the lord|mayor. By this it appeared that he had taken re|fuge in Cambray. The juncture was favourable for bringing him to puni&s;hment, as the duke of Bedford was then negotiating the peace at Paris, and the French court was willing to oblige that of Great Britain. His grace, by his maje&s;ty's order, applied to have Rice apprehended at Cambray, which was accordingly done, and he was &s;ent over<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial, and execution of Rice the brok|er.</NOTE> to England, where he was tried at the Old-Bailey for forgery, convicted, and executed; but it ap|peared he had no accomplices.

One of tho&s;e private bridewells was &s;ituated at Chel&s;ea. It received all who were brought to it; and though it was not pretended that they were lunatics, yet they were treated as &s;uch. Wives were &s;hut up at the reque&s;t of their hu&s;bands, and drunkenne&s;s was a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for one per&s;on to impri&s;on another, to debar him from all acce&s;s to pen, ink, and paper, and to keep him from the knowledge of his neare&s;t relations, if they &s;hould call for him at the place of confinement. It was farther proved, that any per|&s;on might be thus confined, upon application to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and engaging for the regular payment of a &s;tipulated &s;um. Tho&s;e, and other circum&s;tances, equally dete&s;table, were fully made out before the committee, who heard them with the deepe&s;t concern and indignation. But, though it was generally expected that mea&s;ures would have been taken, not only for preventing the like abu&s;es for the future, but that the delinquents would have been brought to condign puni&s;hment for what had pa&s;&s;ed: yet, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;ur|prize of the public, the whole was dropped, and a &s;cene which was thought to be of greater import|ance was now opened.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. The rage of writing conti|nues.</NOTE> The &s;teadine&s;s of his maje&s;ty in &s;upporting the alterations he had made in his mini&s;try, di&s;concert+ed the old mini&s;ters and their friends to a degree of inquietude &s;carcely to be conceived, e&s;pecially after they &s;aw that their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors di&s;placed their &s;ubor|dinate creatures from many offices and departments of government. As they could complain of no uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ure that had been pur&s;ued, and as the votes of parliament fully vindicated the conduct of the mini&s;try, they had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t de&s;perate expedients for inflaming the lower ranks of people. Though the new mini&s;try might have ea&s;ily cru&s;hed the authors of the papers and pamphlets publi&s;hed again&s;t them in the ordinary cour&s;e of law-proceedings, (as their names were printed at full length in many audacious libels,) yet they per&s;evered in the mo&s;t amazing contempt and di&s;regard of all the abu&s;e offered to their own per&s;ons, e&s;pecially in a periodical publication of a paper called the North Briton, which was in&s;olent and attrocious beyond the example of all former oppo&s;itions, in the mo&s;t di&s;tempered periods of go|vernment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Impri&s;on|ment of Mr. Wilkes,</NOTE> One Mr. Wilkes, member of parliament for Ayle&s;bury, was at very little pains to conceal that he was the author of this paper, which, in point of wit, language, or argument, could never have attracted the attention of the public, had not the minds of the people, by the arts of faction, been inflamed to a degree of madne&s;s Wilkes was lively but &s;uperficial, and in his morals he was &s;aid to be di&s;&s;ipated even to profligacy.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> for a po&s;t that might repair his &s;hattered for|tunes; but prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from his cha|racter were &s;o &s;trong again&s;t him, that failing of &s;ucce&s;s, he re&s;olved, as he openly declar|ed, to try how far it was practicable to carry the l$centiou&s;ne&s;s of writing, under pretext of ex|er$i&s;ing the liberty of the pre&s;s. Perceiving the next to &s;toical indifference of the mini&s;try with regard to their own per&s;ons, he aimed his abu&s;e at maje&s;ty it&s;elf, and, in the forty-fifth number of his paper, animadverted upon the king's &s;peech in parliament, with an acrimony &s;o indecent towards his maje&s;ty's probity as well as per&s;on, that the mini&s;ters could no longer avoid giving orders for &s;eizing the printer, and all concerned in the pub|lication. Tho&s;e orders were contained in a war|rant of a general nature, under the hand of lord Hallifax, directed to four of his maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;en|gers, commanding them to apprehend, without &s;pecifying their names, the authors, printers, and publi&s;hers of that &s;editious and trea&s;onable paper; and the publi&s;her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">George $word$ in Ludgate-&s;treet.</NOTE> being accordingly apprehended, his examination afforded &s;ufficient ground for fix|ing up n Mr. Wilkes as the author.</P>
<P>This warrant, though afterwards pronounced to be illegal by a lord chief ju&s;tice, was, in point of form and &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame that had always been i&s;&s;ued by former &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, and even by Mr. P&mdash;tt and the d&mdash;e of N&mdash;e, who&s;e party now openly contended that it was &s;ubver&s;ive

of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. On the 29th of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> late at night, the me&s;&s;engers entered the hou&s;e of Mr. Wilkes, and produced their warrant, which he refu&s;ed to comply with, on account of its general terms; but next morning they returned, and car|ried him in a coach before one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, partly, as he alledged, by force. In the mean time a motion was made in the court of Common Pleas, for an habeas corpus; which was granted. The &s;eizure and &s;ealing up of pa|pers, when any per&s;on was taken into cu&s;tody for a libel, though not trea&s;onable, had always been cu&s;tomary, and the practice had been &s;trenuou&s;ly defended, e&s;pecially under whig mini&s;ters. The &s;ame proceeding was ob&s;erved on this occa&s;ion, but with an indulgence to Mr. Wilkes which had not been &s;hewn to former pri&s;oners in his &s;ituation; for the under-&s;ecretary of &s;tate, and the &s;olicitor of the trea&s;ury, attended, and invited the friends of Mr. Wilkes to be pre&s;ent at &s;ealing up his papers, an operation which had in pa&s;t times been always performed by the me&s;&s;enger, (were he ever &s;o rude or illiterate,) who took the delinquent into cu&s;tody. Mr. Wilkes, after his examination, of cour&s;e was committed to clo&s;e pri&s;on (the Tower of London) by the two &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. Earl T&mdash;le went to pay him a vi&s;it, but was denied admittance by major Rainsford, the officer of the Tower, who had him in cu&s;tody. His coun&s;el and &s;olicitor &s;oon after made the &s;ame application, but met with the like refu&s;al, the major alledging, that he had re|ceived orders from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, not to admit any per&s;on whatever to &s;ee or &s;peak with the
<PB N="214" REF="2210">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> pri&s;oner. Next day the major repeated his refu&s;al of admittance to &s;everal noblemen and gentlemen of di&s;tinction, but readily gave to the council and &s;olicitor for Mr. Wilkes a copy of his commitment. The &s;olicitor of the trea&s;ury&punc; who is generally the manager of government-pro&s;ecutions, interced|ed with the major for leave of admittance to Mr Wilkes's lawyers; but the major continued inflexible in his refu&s;al. By this time, the court of Common Pleas had ordered a return to their writ of habeas corpus, which having been &s;erv|ed upon the me&s;&s;engers only, th ir return was that Mr. Wilkes was not then in their cu&s;tody. The court not judging that return to be &s;ufficient, would not &s;uffer it to be filed&punc; and another writ of habeas corpus was granted, directed to the con&s;table of the Tower of London and his officers; and in con&s;equence of this, Mr. Wilkes was brought up next day (May the 3d) to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. Up|on his entering the court he made a formal &s;peech, replete with virulent expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the mini|&s;try, affected compliments to the per&s;on of his maje&s;ty, and laboured encomiums upon him&s;elf, as the dauntle&s;s champion and per&s;ecuted &s;ufferer in the cau&s;e of public liberty. Pleadings followed on both &s;ides; and Mr. Wilkes was remanded to the Tower, till Friday the 6th of May, that the judges might have lei&s;ure to form their opinion; but in the intermediate time his friends and law|yers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is relea&s;ed on ac|count of privilege.</NOTE> were to have free admittance to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Being accordingly, on that day, brought back to court, he made another &s;peech, &s;till more la|boured than the former, but of the &s;ame inflam|matory
<PB N="215" REF="2220">
tendency. Lord chief ju&s;tice Pratt then<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> proceeded to give the opinion of the court. He &s;tated the ca&s;e in hand under three heads Fir&s;t, the legality of Mr. Wilkes's commitment. Se|condly, the nece&s;&s;ity for a &s;pecification of tho&s;e particular pa&s;&s;ages in the 45th numb. of the North Briton, which had been deemed a libel. And, thirdly, Mr. Wilkes's privilege as a member of parliament. Under the fir&s;t head, his lord&s;hip thought that the commitment of Mr. Wilkes was not illegal, becau&s;e, though the warrant of a &s;e|cretary of &s;tate in &s;uch a ca&s;e was not of &s;uperior force to that of a ju&s;tice of peace, and though no magi&s;trate had, in reality, a right, <HI>ex officio,</HI> to apprehend any per&s;on, without &s;tating the particu|lar crime of which he was accu&s;ed; yet at the &s;ame time he ob&s;erved "there were many precedents where a nice combination of circum&s;tances gave &s;o &s;trong a &s;u&s;picion of facts, that though the magi|&s;trate could not be ju&s;tified <HI>ex officio,</HI> he was, ne|verthele&s;s, &s;upported in the commitment, even without receiving any particular information for the foundation of the charge."</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd divi&s;ion, he was of opinion that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;pecification mentioned; and thought that if the whole of the obnoxious paper had been in&s;erted in the body of the warrant, yet it did not at that time come under his cognizance; nor could it, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a jury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opinon of the lord chief ju&s;|tice on that head.</NOTE> Upon the third head, he remarked, "that there were but three ca&s;es which could po&s;&s;ibly affect the privilege of a member of parliament, and the&s;e were
<PB N="216" REF="2230">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> <HI>trea&s;on, felony,</HI> and the <HI>peace,"</HI> or which is the &s;ame thing, the breach of it. He ob&s;erved that the com|mitment of the bi&s;hops for endeavouring to di&s;turb the peace happened in an arbitrary reign, when there was but one hone&s;t judge in the court of King's Bench. He concluded, that "Mr. Wilkes &s;tood accu&s;ed of writing a libel; a libel in the &s;en&s;e of the law was a <HI>high mi&s;demeanor,</HI> but did not come within the de&s;cription of <HI>trea&s;on, felony,</HI> or <HI>breach of the peace:</HI> at mo&s;t, it had but a tenden|cy to <HI>di&s;turb</HI> the <HI>peace,</HI> and con&s;equently could not be &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the privilege of a member of parliament."</P>
<P>The court then di&s;charged Mr. Wilkes, who returned the judges his thanks in the name of the public, and of the whole Engli&s;h nation, and eve|ry &s;ubject of the Engli&s;h crown, for his liberty; though it is very evident that he obtained it only under the circum&s;tance of his being a member of parliament. As it is the chief duty of hi&s;tory to record facts as they ari&s;e, it is &s;ufficient here to ob|&s;erve that many other eminent lawyers, and in|deed a majority of the hou&s;e of commons, were of opinion that no privilege was due in &s;uch ca&s;es&punc; and it was ob&s;erved that the only triumph which the minority could boa&s;t of on this occa&s;ion, was a temporary deliverance of Mr. Wilkes on the above account; but that he was &s;till &s;ubject to a pro&s;e|cution by the attorney general, which his maje&s;ty had ordered.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this affair &s;everal inci|dents happened that were the &s;ubjects of the pub|lic's amu&s;ement, rather than its attention. The
<PB N="217" REF="2240">
day after Mr. Wilkes was delivered from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> Tower he wrote a letter to the two &s;ecretaries of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letters between Mr. Wilkes and the &s;ecreta|ries of &s;tate.</NOTE> &s;tate, complaining, that, during his confinement, his hou&s;e had been robbed; and that being inform|ed his goods were in the cu&s;tody of their lord&s;hips, he in&s;i&s;ted upon re&s;titution. Next day he repaired to a ju&s;tice of peace, and demanded a warrant to &s;earch the hou&s;es of the two &s;ecretaries; which the magi&s;trate refu&s;ed to grant. Though nothing could be more impotent and extravagant than tho&s;e proceedings; yet the &s;ecretaries, to the &s;urprize of the friends of the government, thought proper to return, under their own hands, a &s;erious an&s;wer to his charge; which afforded him a commodious han|dle to &s;end their lord&s;hips a reply &s;tuffed with in|&s;ults and &s;currility, but &s;uch as added to his cha|racter among the vulgar. His maje&s;ty, at the &s;ame time ordered the earl of Egremont to &s;ignify to earl Temple, who was lord lieutenant of the county of Buckingham, his plea&s;ure, that Mr. Wilkes &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from being colonel of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Wilkes removed from be|ing colo|nel of the militia.</NOTE> the Buckingham&s;hire militia; and this command was intimated to Mr. Wilkes with apparent reluctancy by his lord&s;hip, who was him&s;elf &s;oon after removed from the lieutenancy of the &s;ame county, to make way for lord De&s;pencer, late &s;ir Francis Da&s;h|wood. The letters that pa&s;&s;ed on Mr. Wilkes's be|ing removed were likewi&s;e publi&s;hed, and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly circulated, to &s;well the popular clamour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An infor|mation filed a|gain&s;t him.</NOTE> While Mr. Wilkes affected to be thought the champion of a party, he was no other than the tool of a faction. The men of &s;en&s;e in the oppo&s;ition de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;hunned, and hated him; nor could all

To give him&s;elf &s;ome co|lour of importance he publicly adverti&s;ed the print|ing all the proceedings again&s;t him at a private pre&s;s he &s;et up in his own hou&s;e; and the exorbi|tant price at which they were to be &s;old, was a &s;uf|ficient evidence that he intended this publication &s;hould indemnify him for his &s;ufferings and ex|pence, and &s;upport him again&s;t the pro&s;ecution he was threatened with. But even this exped$ent, plau&s;ible and practicable as it appeared to be, had very little effect in his favour. I he mini&s;try were &s;o far from being intimidated, that an information was filed again&s;t him in the court of King's Bench, for bring the author of the North Briton, N^o 45.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the per&s;onal veracity of Mr. Wilkes receive a &s;evere &s;hock by his being called<NOTE PLACE="marg">His vera|city que&s;|tioned.</NOTE> upon in the public papers to make good an a&s;&s;er|tion he had advanced in his &s;peech at the court of Common Pleas that corrupt offers had been made to him by the government; and to declare when, how, o by whom &s;uch offers were made, and what they were. Neither Mr. Wilkes nor any of his friends thought proper to take any notice of this peremptory challenge, though often repeated, and affecting his moral character in the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible part.</P>

It was worded with remark|able decency, as they grounded their approbation of the peace upon that which it had already receiv|ed from parliament, and they &s;hewed a becoming abhorrence of the &s;pirit of faction then ari&s;ing. Great pains were taken by the lower part of the ci|tizens to ridicule and vilify this mea&s;ure; but it &s;erved to di&s;abu&s;e the public, e&s;pecially as to the opinion which had been propagated concerning the aver&s;ion of the city of London towards the late treaty.</P>

A duel with pi&s;tols in Hyde-Park en&s;ued, in which both parties behaved like men of courage; but Mr. Wilkes was wounded in the body &s;o dangerou&s;ly, that he was in no condition to appear in the hou&s;e of commons, when the matter of his complaint was to be heard. On the 16th, however, the farther con&s;ideration of his maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;age was put off till the 18th; and, through the &s;peaker's illne&s;s, the hou&s;e did not proceed upon it till the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;oluti|ons with regard to privilege.</NOTE> 23d, when a motion was made, "That privilege of parliament does not extend to the ca&s;e of writing and publi&s;hing &s;editious libels, nor ought to be allowed to ob&s;truct the ordinary cour&s;e of the laws, in the &s;peedy and effectual pro&s;ection of &s;o heinous and dangerous an offence." As this re&s;olution was far from being agreeable to the opi|nion given by the lord chief ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, a great debate aro&s;e; which being adjourn|ed, in complain&s;ance to the &s;peaker, was not deter|mined till the 24th, when it was carried by a ma|jority of 125. A number of members on this oc|ca&s;ion &s;poke and voted again&s;t the re&s;olution, on|ly becau&s;e they thought it was a matter founded in the con&s;titution, independent of all party-con&s;ide|ration. With regard to the debate concerning the complaint of Mr. Wilkes for breach of privilege, it was put off on account of his wound.</P>
<P>After the commons had agreed to the above im|portant re&s;olutions, it was ordered, that lord Strange &s;hould go up to the hou&s;e of lords to de&s;ire a con|ference for obtaining the concurrence of their

lord&s;hips; which was accordingly granted, and their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Both hou&s;es join in an addre&s;s to the king.</NOTE> lord&s;hips agreed to the re&s;olutions. It was then re&s;olved by the commons, "That the printed pa|per, intitled, the North Briton, N^o 45 which was communicated to the lords at the la&s;t conference, be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, at the Royal Exchange in London; upon Satur|day next, at one of the clock; and that the &s;he|riffs of London do then attend, and cau&s;e the &s;ame to be burnt there accordingly." The com|mons obtained this concurrence of the lords to the re&s;olution likewi&s;e, as they did to another, which was unanimou&s;ly agreed upon, to expre&s;s their &s;ur|prize and indignation at the &s;candalous and &s;editi|ous libel which they had cen&s;ured. This addre&s;s was drawn up in terms of &s;uch warm affection for his maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government, that it was evident the two hou&s;es meant it as a mark of their &s;ignal $word$ of &s;uch libellous writings, and as a proof to all Europe that their &s;entiments and th$&s;e of the mini&s;try were the &s;ame, whatever pains might be taken to impre&s;s foreigners with an oppo|&s;ite opinion. His maje&s;ty, by his an&s;wer, &s;eemed to take a peculiar &s;atisfaction in this addre&s;s, which wonderfully di&s;concerted the oppo&s;ition, and left no farther handle for pretending, as was mo&s;t in|du&s;triou&s;ly given out, that matters in parliament were ready to take a turn to the di&s;advantage of the government.</P>
<P>Hitherto the charge of being the author of the obnoxious paper had not, by any regular mo$ion, been urged per&s;onally again&s;t Mr. Wilkes; but, on the $word$ o$ December, when the members re&s;um|ed

While this matter was depending, the &s;heriffs of London, who were the honourable Mr. Harley, and Richard Blunt, e&s;q; endeavoured to execute the order of the two hou&s;es, by burning the 4$th number of the North Briton at the Royal Exchange; but the mob proved &s;o riotous on this occa&s;ion, that they re&s;cued the paper from the exe|cutioner before it was con&s;umed, pelted the con|&s;tables, and other peace-officers, and even put Mr. &s;heriff Harley in danger of his life. This riot being reported in the two hou&s;es of parliament, they entered very &s;eriou&s;ly in con&s;ideration of its con&s;equences: and re&s;olved, after the $lords had examined Mr. alderman Harley, "that the rio|ters were perturbators of the public peace, dange|rous to the liberties of this country, and ob&s;truc|tors of the national ju&s;tice." The two &s;heri&s;&s;s at the &s;ame time had the thanks of the hou&s;e for their $word$ behaviour on that occa&s;ion; and the two hou&s;es joined unanimou&s;ly in an addre&s;s to his ma|je&s;tly, that he would give directions for the disco|very of the rioters.</P>
<P>The walls of parliament as yet contained the de|ba$es on this affair, which was of far greater im|portance than the public at fir&s;t apprehended.
<PB N="227" REF="2340">
The re&s;olutions of neither hou&s;e could deter|mine<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the great points depending on it, for tho&s;e were cognizable only in a court of law. In the July preceding, the journeymen printers who had been &s;eized and confined on &s;u&s;picion of printing the North Briton brought actions again&s;t the me&s;|&s;engers on that account. On the fir&s;t action that was tried the plaintiff recovered 300l. damages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verdicts obtained by the printers.</NOTE> and 200l. was allowed to each of the others, who were thirteen in number. It appeared from tho&s;e trials that the plaintiffs were not really guilty of the fact for which they had been &s;eized; that the me&s;&s;engers had been mi&s;led by the general terms of the warrants; and that room was left for conte&s;ting their validity. At the &s;ame time, the cooler and more judicious part of the public thought the damanges, con&s;idering the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the parties, were exorbitant; and that the verdicts in their favour would only &s;erve to exa&s;perate the mini&s;ters, when it &s;hould be their turns to pro&s;ecute. Mr. Wilkes, who no doubt was highly encouraged by the verdicts the printers had obtained, brought his action likewi&s;e again&s;t the late &s;ecretary of &s;tate for &s;eizing his pa|pers; and on the 6th of December, after a hearing of near fifteen hours before lord chief ju&s;tice Pratt, and a &s;pecial jury in the court of Common Pleas, he obtained a verdict with 1000l. damages, and co&s;ts of &s;uit. In the charge given on this occa&s;ion by the judge to the jury, his lord&s;hip pronounced the warrant under which Mr. Wilkes was &s;eized, illegal; but very mode&s;tly &s;ubmitted his own opi|nion to the other judges and the hou&s;e of peers,

<P>So &s;olemn a deci&s;ion was con&s;idered by the gen|tlemen in the oppo&s;ition as a matter of triumph, which they endeavoured to improve by a mo&s;t ri|diculous incident which happened on the night the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt upon Mr. Wilkes by a mad|man.</NOTE> verdict was obtained. One Dunn, a Scotchman, and a lunatic, having been overheard to make u&s;e of &s;ome threatening expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t Mr. Wilkes, the latter was apprized of them, and Dunn next morning making an effort to get admi&s;&s;ion into the hou&s;e of Mr. Wilkes, who&s;e wound &s;till con|fined him to his room, he was &s;eized upon, and $i$armed of a penknife, which the party reported was to be the in&s;trument for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Mr. Wilkes. The lunatic, Dunn, was committed to the cu&s;tody of a tip&s;taff, and Mr. Wilkes's friends took the matter up &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, that a com|plaint was made to the hou&s;e of commons, who or|dered the tip &s;taff to bring Dunn to their bar, and the evidences again&s;t him to attend at the &s;ame time. Before this could be done, the hou&s;e was &s;atisfied, by indi&s;putable evidence, that Dunn was a madman; and he was remitted to the cour&s;e of common law, which confined him for &s;ome time to pri&s;on for want of ba l. Though nothing could be more plain than the in&s;anity of this wretch, yet the party &s;till continued to a&s;firm that he was an $word$ becau&s;e he was a Scotchman, and even

This complaint could not have properly come before their lord&s;hips, had not the name of a right reverend prelate been mo&s;t &s;$cur|rilou&s;ly introduced, as being the author of the notes. The book it&s;elf, though printed with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy, had been communicated, through Mr. Wilkes's own inadvertency, to the &s;ecretary by a journeyman printer, who was $word$ of a co|py, and the very mention of its contents $word$ the public with horror. The concern which the pretended patriot had in printing and correcting the pre&s;s was proved beyond all contradiction, and left on the minds of the public a &s;trong conviction of his being the author al$o. Scarcely any defence was made for him by his friends, and the hou&s;e addre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty to give orders that he &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted; but neither this addre&s;s, nor the pro&s;ecutions intended to be brought again&s;t him for breach of privilege, had any other $word$ than that of greatly encrea&s;ing the number of his ene|mies in the rational unprepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed part of the nation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While Mr. Wilkes re|&s;ided at Paris, an adventure happened to him, which made a far greater noi&s;e in the world than its importance de|&s;erves.

The challenge was given on the &s;treets of Paris, and Mr. Wilkes very properly evaded making a noi&s;e there, but told Mr. Forbes the place where he lived.

by this re&s;olution, &s;hould it have pa&s;&s;ed, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> friends of the admini&s;tration objected to it. They in&s;i&s;ted that it was a point not proper for the cog|ni&s;ance of the hou&s;e at that time, as uninterrupted u&s;age had given it a &s;anction, and as it did not ap|pear to have been abu&s;ed in the in&s;tance referred to. They thought that the confining the re&s;olu|tion to the ca&s;e of general warrants again&s;t a &s;editi|ous libel only, was a kind of a tacit approbation of their being employed in all other ca&s;es; and that therefore the re&s;olution, as it then &s;tood, would ra|ther &s;trenthen than prevent the evil complained of. They farther urged, that &s;hould a court of law con|form them&s;elves to the propo&s;ed re&s;olution (which, though it &s;hould pa&s;s, would not be law) and if the lords, in their judicial capacities, when appealed to, &s;hould decree for the legality of the general warrants, the con&s;equences both with regard to the courts of law, and the dignity of the hou&s;e of commons, mu&s;t be very di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>During the debate, the friends of the mini&s;try were far from vindicating the practice of general warrants, but they thought that the abu&s;e of them could not be effectually prevented by a re&s;olution of one hou&s;e upon a &s;ingle ca&s;e; and that the re|medy &s;hould be provided by an act of parliament, after mo&s;t &s;olemn debate and deliberation, di&s;tin|gui&s;hing ca&s;es, and &s;pecifying tho&s;e di&s;cretionary powers, which the contingent exigencies of govern|ment require to be ve&s;ted in a &s;ecretary of &s;tate. Sir John Philips, who was one of the majority, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with great warmth again&s;t the abu&s;e of general warrants, and, with the approba|tion

Such a bill was actually brought in, but it was treated by the gentlemen in the mino|rity with a mixture of ridicule and contempt, on pretence that Sir John was not in earne&s;t, and that they had no power to regulate an abu&s;e. It was replied, that the bill was meant to regulate the practice; but they appeared determined to oppo&s;e the bill and it was accordingly withdrawn, the de|bate being adjourned to the 17th of February.</P>
<P>When the hou&s;e met again, it appeared beyond all contradiction, that the motion, &s;hould it pa&s;s, was ineffectual for redre&s;&s;ing the evil; and, after long debates, it was drawn up in the following manner: <Q>&startq;That a general warrant for apprehend|ing and &s;eizing the authors, printers, and publi&s;h|ers, of a &s;editious and TREASONABLE l$bel, toge|ther with their papers, is not warranted by law; although &s;uch warrant hath been i&s;&s;ued accord|ing to the u&s;age of office, and hath been fre|quently produced to, and, &s;o far as appears to this hou&s;e, the validity thereof hath never been debated in the court of King's bench, but the parties thereupon have been frequently bailed by the &s;aid court.&endq;</Q> This &s;tate of the que&s;tion, as it was amended, (if not by the heads of the mino|rity, yet with their concurrence and con&s;ent), &s;ub|jected it to new and in&s;urmountable difficulties, becau&s;e upon debate it was found, that it implied no le&s;s than a charge of perjury upon the court of King's bench, for admitting to bail per&s;ons com|mitted upon &s;uch illegal warrants, in&s;tead of giving

<PB N="237" REF="2440">
He was &s;u&s;pected of having entered into<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> mea&s;ures with the Dutch for calling them in to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the power and influence of the Engli&s;h in the country, and of his having offered to &s;acrifice the company's &s;ervants and intere&s;ts to &s;hah Zaddah, who pretended to be the true heir of the mogul empire. In &s;hort, it was pretended, that, by a &s;e$ies of cruelties and oppre&s;&s;ions of various kinds, he had rendered it &s;candalous for the Eng|li&s;h to &s;upport his tyrannic government any longer; having brought the company's and his own affairs to the very brink of ruin. Such was the charge that was brought again&s;t this nabob by Mr. Van|&s;ittart, Mr. Holwell, and other &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India company in Bengal. Other gentlemen in the &s;ame &s;ervice repre&s;ented matters in a differ|ent light, which makes it nece&s;&s;ary here to &s;tate more particularly the facts that preceded the depo|&s;ition of Mhir Jaffier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See vol. iv. p. 245.</NOTE> Shah Zaddah, in right of his mogul&s;hip, claimed all the original powers exerci&s;ed by the emperors of Indo&s;tan, or India, previous to the inva&s;ion of that empire by Nadir Shah; and we have already recounted the defeat he &s;uffered by the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company's forces, under major Carnac. It &s;eems to be certain, that the death of Mhir Jaf|fier's &s;on, who is &s;aid to have been killed in his tent by lightning, had made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the father, who was daily apprehen&s;ive of con&s;piracies again&s;t him&s;elf, as he had no &s;on to &s;ucceed him. Jealou&s;y and dread is the governing principle of tho&s;e Ea&s;tern courts. A legal trial is &s;eldom or never granted; to be &s;u&s;pected is to be guilty, and
<PB N="238" REF="2450">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the mo&s;t involuntary connections are admitted as evi|dences of trea&s;on. In con&s;equence of tho&s;e dete&s;t|able maxims, Mhir Jaffier had put to death &s;ome of the late Surajah Dowla's family and friends; and it is very po&s;&s;ible that he might have wi&s;hed, not to have been &s;o entirely dependent, as he was, upon the Engli&s;h, and, that they might have re|ceived &s;ome counter-balance from a partial admi&s;&s;i|on of the Dutch into his government. It is, however, certain, that no part of his conduct gave unque&s;ti|onable grounds for this &s;urmi&s;e, becau&s;e, after the Dutch made &s;uch an attempt, he &s;ent troops to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, and, had the latter con|&s;ented, he would have put them all to the &s;word.</P>
<P>Another article urged again&s;t Mhir Jaffier was, his having ob&s;tructed the currency of the Engli&s;h Calcutta coin; but from this charge his friends endeavoured to clear him, by alledging, that this &s;toppage was owing to the bankers, who&s;e practices he could not controul, while Shah Zaddah was ma&s;|ter of the &s;outhern provinces, and, by encouraging the tributary rajahs to rebel, cut off all the re&s;ources on which Mhir Jaffier depended for &s;atisfying the demands of the Engli&s;h, who became every day more and more clamorous. Such was the &s;tate of affairs when Mr. Holwell re&s;igned the pre&s;ident|&s;hip and government of Fort William to Mr. Van|&s;ittart, in Augu&s;t 1760, and at the &s;ame time re|mon&s;trated to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or the nece&s;&s;ity of depo&s;|ing Mhir Jaffier, for the cau&s;es above-mentioned, and many others, which rendered that nabob the ob|ject of public horror and dete&s;tation. But the conduct of the two Engli&s;h chiefs, if the unpopularity of
<PB N="239" REF="2460">
Mhir Jaffier was &s;o great, is pretty unaccountable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> for, in&s;tead of declaring openly again&s;t him, they laid a deep, and indeed an artful, train for his ruin. Mr. Holwell, it &s;eems, had for &s;ome time, kept up a corre&s;pondence with Co&s;&s;im Ali Cawn, Mhir Jaffier's &s;on-in-law, who had made &s;uch pro|po&s;itions of advantage for the company, that he was con&s;idered as a proper per&s;on to &s;ucceed Mhir Jaffier, if the latter was depo&s;ed. Co&s;&s;im, at this time, had the confidence of his father-in-law, whom he per&s;uaded to &s;end him, under pretence of con|certing the operations of the approaching cam|paign, to Calcutta, where the mea&s;ures were con|certed for depo&s;ing Mhir Jaffier, or rather for de|priving him of all power in the government. It was agreed, "That he &s;hould &s;till maintain his dignity; that affairs &s;hould be tran&s;acted in his name, and that he &s;hould have an allowance to &s;upport him; that Co&s;&s;im &s;hould conduct all the public affairs of the &s;oubah&s;hip, and be named his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and live in perpetual alliance with the Engli&s;h factory. The Engli&s;h Sipoys were to be always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and the revenues of the three countries of Burdwan, Midnepoor, and Chittegong, were to be a&s;&s;igned to the Engli&s;h."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mhir Jaf|fier de|po&s;ed,</NOTE> Such were the principal articles of this clande&s;|tine treaty, by which a great prince (for &s;uch Mhir Jaffier was) without his own knowledge, was to be &s;tript of his power.

The &s;econd letter related to the affairs of Patna; and the third mentioned certain articles to which he was required to &s;ubmit, toge|ther with a requi&s;ition of lands, for the payment of the Engli&s;h troops, under the pa$n of his being forced to comply.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in favour of Co&s;&s;im AliCawn.</NOTE> It was no wonder if Mhir Jaffier was alarmed even to a &s;tate of di&s;traction at tho&s;e peremptory demands.

A letter was &s;ent in to the nabob, de|manding his immediate compliance, and di&s;po&s;iti|ons were made for &s;eizing his mini&s;ters. Mhir Jaffier could do nothing but complain in the mo&s;t pathetic terms of the u&s;age he met with from the Engli&s;h, whom he accu&s;ed of perjury and breach of faith; but at la&s;t recollecting, that he had &s;worn to be for ever their friend, he dropt all thoughts of re&s;entment, and offered, rather than continue un|der the power of his &s;on-in-law, to re&s;ign the &s;ou|bah&s;hip, provided he could be a&s;&s;ured of a &s;afe re|treat in Calcutta, with an allowance for his mainte|nance. This propo&s;ition, which was con&s;trued in|to a voluntary re&s;ignation, was in&s;tantly agreed to, and Co&s;&s;im proclaimed nabob, to the apparent &s;a|tisfaction of the people. Mhir Jaffier was hurried into a boat, and &s;ent to Calcutta, with &s;ome of his women, and an attendance no way &s;uited to his dignity.

The Shah Zaddah was defeated by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, and the rebellious rajahs were reduced.

His manoeuvres were interrupted by a &s;trong detachment of the enemy's Sipoys, who, with &s;ome difficulty, were beaten off, but not be|fore they had blown up a principal magazine, the property of the Engli&s;h; three boats belonging to the company, laden with ammunition, were lo&s;t at the &s;ame time by a violent gu&s;t of wind. The &s;iege, however, went on, though with great difficulty. The enemy made an ob&s;tinate defence, by which many of the Engli&s;h officers were wounded, but

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the city was at la&s;t carried, and Co&s;&s;im retired pre|cipitately to La&s;&s;arum, from whence he proceeded with all his trea&s;ure and valuable effects to the con|fines of Surajah Dowla's country, where all he could obtain was an a&s;ylum for him&s;elf and his family.</P>
<P>So many vici&s;&s;itudes of the Engli&s;h affairs in the Ea&s;t Indies, occa&s;ioned an incredible ferment in London, among all who had any concern with that company. The public was &s;urprized that &s;uch im|portant events had pa&s;&s;ed without being known to any but the directors; and a party was formed, with lord Clive at its head, for putting the directi|on into other hands, at the approaching election of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed|ings of the Ea&s;t-India company in Eng|land.</NOTE> directors. On the 12th of March, a very numerous general court of the Ea&s;t-India proprietors was held, and opened by Sir Francis Go&s;ling, who declared, "The bu&s;ine&s;s of their meeting to be to enquire into the pre&s;ent condition of the company's affairs abroad; to endeavour to di&s;cover the cau&s;es of the misfortunes that had happened at Bengal; to learn what &s;teps had been taken by the directors to re|medy tho&s;e misfortunes; and their rea&s;ons for di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing many of their old &s;ervants, and appointing a gentleman, &s;eventh in the council at Bombay, (meaning Mr. Van&s;ittart) to be governor at Bengal, in preference to another gentleman who &s;hould re|gularly have &s;ucceeded to that tru&s;t."</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the day was then divided into three heads. Under the fir&s;t was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the con|duct of Mr Van&s;ittart in advancing Co&s;&s;im A$ Cawn to the nabob&s;hip, and depo&s;ing Mhir Jaffier in direct oppo&s;ition, as was alledged, to his coun|cil,
<PB N="251" REF="2580">
whom he ought to have con&s;ulted. As the ori|ginal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> principles upon which this revolution was brought about had been entirely conformable to the &s;entiments of the directors them&s;elves, this matter bore a &s;trenuous debate, which threw the a&s;&s;em|bly into &s;ome confu&s;ion, if not tumult. Many let|ters and papers were read to prove the expediency and nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure, and many to &s;hew its pernicious tendency; but their contents were &s;o directly contradictory to one another, that the de|bates on this head were, upon the whole, trifling and ineffectual. Under the &s;econd head was di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed the management of the company's &s;ervants at Calcutta. It was alledged, and many papers produced to confirm it, that the majority of the council had demanded exorbitant &s;ums from the new nabob, who had refu&s;ed to comply with the pay|ment, while the governor prote&s;ted again&s;t them. It was, on the other hand urged, that, without breaking the arrangements which had been made between Co&s;&s;im and Mr. Van&s;ittart, the company's affairs mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely ruined in India. To this it was replied, that they could have had no other effect than the reducing the profits of the compa|ny's &s;ervants, who wanted to be exempted from all duties, and even to trade duty-free. Nay, it was urged, that they often covered under their names the illicit trade of the natives. The undue pre|ference that had been given to many of the com|pany's principal &s;ervants, formed the third and la&s;t head of this debate, which grew more warm than ever, the friends of tho&s;e po&s;tponed or preferred intere&s;ting them&s;elves with uncommon ardour.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> But we are here to take a &s;hort view of the &s;tate of lord Clive's affairs with regard to the company, and which indeed were thought to have given ri&s;e to the original divi&s;ion among the directors and proprietors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See vol. ii. p. 46 to p. 52. State of the ca&s;e between the com|pany and lord Clive.</NOTE> We have already more than once mentioned the va&s;t &s;ervices performed by lord Clive, when in the company's &s;ervice in India, for which he had been recompenced very de&s;ervedly by Mhir Ja&s;fier, with a jaghire, or &s;ettlement, upon the revenues of that country, i&s;&s;uing from the re&s;erved rent of the lands which had been ceded to the company by that prince; and this jaghire, which amounted to near 30,000 l. a year, was con&s;equently to be paid by the factory. As his lord&s;hip had &s;o great a con|cern in the welfare of the company, he thought it was rea&s;onable that he &s;hould have &s;ome part of its management. He differed with the directors in wording the article relating to the Ea&s;t Indies in the preliminaries for peace, and it was accordingly al|tered; many occurrences happened which indicat|ed that tho&s;e who were in the &s;ecret of the direction were aver&s;e to his lord&s;hip's having a &s;eat at their board, and the oppo&s;ition to him was thought to ari&s;e principally from Mr. Sullivan, the deputy-chairman, who was &s;aid to under&s;tand the affairs of the direction better than any man in England. His lord&s;hip's intere&s;t being very &s;trong, his friends pre&s;&s;ed his admi&s;&s;ion into the director&s;hip; and matters went &s;o high, that orders were &s;ent to the company's &s;ervants to &s;top the payment of the jaghire, for the recovery of which his lord&s;hip brought a &s;uit in the chancery of England.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Debates on that head.</NOTE> Various were the rea&s;ons alledged by the directors for this detention, which the public in general re&s;ented as injurious. They objected to the di&s;po|&s;ition which his lord&s;hip had made of the trea&s;ures of the nabob whom he had depo&s;ed; and that he had with-held from the relations of the &s;ufferers in the black-hole at Calcutta the &s;ums &s;tipulated for their indemnification. He was likewi&s;e accu&s;ed of remitting money home by a Dutch &s;hip, contrary to the regulations of the company, and of having &s;up|plied a Portugue&s;e &s;hip with goods and money; but the chief allegation which lay again&s;t him was, that he had no right to the jaghire, which was paid at the company's expence. In an&s;wer to the&s;e alle|gations, his lord&s;hip addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the pro|prietors, which confuted them beyond all po&s;&s;ibi|lity of reply. He proved that the relations of the &s;ufferers at Calcutta, as appeared by their own let|ters of thanks to him, had been more than indem|nified by the &s;crupulous exactne&s;s with which the &s;tipulations in their favour had been fulfilled; that the nabob's trea&s;ures had been punctually applied, according to agreement with Mhir Jaffier, to whom they belonged, and that he &s;ent no money by Dutch &s;hips but in bills, which, not being due till three years after date, were in danger of never being paid, as he was then oppo&s;ing the de&s;igns of the Dutch in Bengal; and that, at the time he &s;ent tho&s;e bills, the company's &s;ervants thought it in|con&s;i&s;tent with their intere&s;t to grant bills. The charge with regard to the Portugue&s;e &s;hip, was proved to be a groundle&s;s fal&s;ity; and his lord|&s;hip &s;hewed that he had at lea&s;t as good a right

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> to his jaghire as the company had to the va&s;t e&s;tates which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The more di&s;intere&s;ted part of the proprietors were of opinion that nothing but the credit, expe|rience, and abilities, of lord Clive in per&s;on could retrieve the di&s;order into which their affairs were thrown in the Ea&s;t Indies. Other meetings were accordingly held to bring about this de&s;irable end; and a motion was made, that lord Clive &s;hould be reque&s;ted to take upon him the pre&s;ident&s;hip of Bengal, and the command of the military forces there. His lord&s;hip, in his an&s;wer, &s;hewed him&s;elf ready to comply with the motion, provided mat|ters could be &s;ettled, &s;o that he could proceed with vigour, &s;upported by a friendly and united direction. Upon this, a letter was &s;ent in form to his lord&s;hip; but in the mean time &s;uch altercations pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and the deputy chairman, that it was very plain his lord&s;hip was re&s;olved to decline the pre&s;ident&s;hip and all military command, if that gentleman continued to take the lead in the com|pany's affairs at London. The directors in the oppo|&s;ition to his lord&s;hip, upon this publi&s;hed the fa|vourable accounts of their affairs in the Ea&s;t In|dies which they had received from major Adams, and which they hoped would convince the public, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for courting lord Clive to accept of the pre&s;ident&s;hip, which he continued to decline unle&s;s Mr. Sullivan was di&s;placed from his $word$ The publication of the accounts from maj$r Adams and governor Van$$$tart damped the zeal of many who had be n mo&s;t forward in pre&s;&s;ing lord Clive to name his own terms; and the $word$

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Sul|livan turned out of the chair.</NOTE> Mr. Sullivan, however, was &s;o near being thrown out of the direction, which he carried only by one vote upon the &s;crutiny of the ballot, that it was plain, bu&s;ine&s;s could not be done, if he continued to lead the board of directors; and a ballot being taken for a chairman, Mr. Rous, lord Clive's friend, was elected, and Mr. Bolton deputy-chairman. This event gave &s;o general a &s;atisfaction, that the company's &s;tock immediately ro&s;e upon it, and fre&s;h applications were made to lord Clive. His lord&s;hip, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to the directors, took notice, that a law-&s;uit was depending between him and the company, concerning his jaghire, which rendered it highly improper for him to go abroad before it was determined; "and therefore, &s;aid his lord&s;hip, allow me to &s;ugge&s;t to you the expediency of referring the matter to a general court of the proprietors, with the propo&s;al I now make, viz. That I &s;hall enjoy my jaghire for ten years, provided the company &s;hall remain &s;o long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e lands, of which the jaghire is the quit-rent, and provided I &s;hall live &s;o long.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debate and divi|&s;ion upon lord Clive's propo|&s;als.</NOTE> In con&s;equence of this letter a general court of the Ea&s;t-India company was held, to deliberate on its contents, which were highly applauded by the public for their moderation; and a re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed for taking the &s;en&s;e of the proprietors by a ballot for empowering the court of directors "to agree with lord Clive for the payment of his jaghire during ten years, if his lord&s;hip &s;hould &s;o long live, and the company &s;hall be in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands, out of which it i&s;&s;ues, and the revenues thereof during that period of time." This que&s;tion created great debates. The court of directors thought them&s;elves obliged to ju&s;tify their pro|ceedings upon the jaghire, by producing the opini|ons which they had taken from the learned of the law. Lord Clive's friends did the &s;ame on their &s;ide; and they were found, on the whole, to be confu&s;ed, contradictory, and irreconcilable to each other. The majority of the meeting, however, &s;eemed in|clinable to clo&s;e with his lord&s;hip's propo&s;al, and a day was fixed for the ballot. Before the company broke up, a motion was made, on the part of his lord&s;hip's friends, with a view of facilitating the &s;ucce&s;s of the ballot, "That, for the future, none of the company's &s;ervants in the Ea&s;t Indies &s;hould, upon pain of expul&s;ion, receive from any of the nabobs, or from any others, any kind of gratuity or reward, without the concurrence or con&s;ent of the council, or of the court of directors of the Ea&s;t-In|dia company."

Which are ac|cepted of.</NOTE> On the day after the ballot was taken, it appear|ed that the que&s;tion was carried for allowing lord Clive his jaghire by a majority of 583 again&s;t 396. Other motions of le&s;s importance were then made, particularly upon a re&s;olution that had been taken by the court of directors to recommend major Adams to the &s;ecretary at war, for his maje&s;ty to confer on him &s;ome higher po&s;t, that he may be continued at Bengal &s;o long as the exigencies of af|fairs &s;hould require. A motion being made upon this re&s;olution, it was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed, as tending to impo&s;e a check upon lord Clive, who was then making preparations for his departure. The mo|tion, however, was carried, as were other motions, for returning the thanks of the court to major Car|nac, and the other officers and troops who had &s;o gallantly &s; rved under major Adams. After this, many debates en&s;ued, which di&s;covered that great heart&punc;burnings &s;till remained among the proprie|tors; but they were of too private a nature to merit a place here. Lord Clive had formed a military e&s;tabli&s;hment for the Ea&s;t Indies, by reducing the company's troops into regiments, and keeping up two battalions in England, with various other regu|lations; but as the di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e particulars mu&s;t have taken up too much time, the debate was ended by a motion being carried, "That the com|pany's a $airs in Bengal requiring immediate atten|tion, and the &s;ea&s;on being very far advanced, lord Clive be de&s;ired to embark forthwith for that go|vernment; and that all the officers now appointed be ordered to proceed th$ther without delay."</P>

<P>As to the court of France, its mini&s;ters were embarra&s;&s;ed by the heavy debts contracted in the late war; and tho' they applied them&s;elves to the reparation of their marine, it made but a &s;low pro|gre&s;s, thro' the lowne&s;s of their finances, while their a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s were greatly exagge|rated by the malcontents in England.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Death of the king of $word$.</NOTE> happened on the 5th of October, threatened new convul&s;ions to that part of Europe. The courts of Ver&s;ailles and Vienna &s;hewed di&s;po&s;itions for op|po&s;ing the elevation of a Pla&s;t, or native, to that throne, to which the people inclined; and the elector of Saxony declared him&s;elf a candidate, in a circular latter which he wrote to all the nobles of Poland.

A magnificent entry was made by the Venetian emba&s;&s;adors into London on the 1$th of April, and the parade con|tinued for two or three days after, when they were introduced to his maje&s;ty at St. James's. The duke de Nivernois took leave of the court next month, highly plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of his em|ba&s;&s;y, and amazed at the magnificence and riches of the Engli&s;h court and nation.

In con&s;e|quence of this principle, commi&s;&s;ioners had been named, who &s;old the prizes; and their produce, amounting to about 700,000 l. was generou&s;ly giv|en by his maje&s;ty towards le&s;&s;ening the public bur|thens.</P>

In this manner the French government paid their &s;ubjects of Canada the balance due to them up|on their trade, which, though detrimental to the royal finances, was very profitable to individuals; and the people of Canada preferred the ordonnances even to ready money.

In 1759, Bigot, the French intendant, who &s;igned tho&s;e ordonnances and bills of exchange, i&s;&s;ued va&s;t quantities of them, on pretence that they were ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of the war; and the Cana|dians took them as u&s;ual, paying for them in ne|ce&s;&s;aries to their full amount. Upon the Engli&s;h taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the province, it was found that the trade of Canada could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t unle&s;s tho&s;e bills were paid; nor could the new &s;ubjects of England, who held them, pay for the goods they imported from Great Britain. Under this difficulty many Engli&s;h merchants were, in a manner, obliged to accept of them in payment, tru&s;ting to the declaration &s;igned by the duke de Choi&s;eul, when the definitive treaty was concluded, for their being di&s;charged. Upon the return of Bigot to France, that court accu&s;ed him of having wantonly and fraudulently i&s;&s;ued out great num|bers of tho&s;e bills, for which he and his accom|plices were &s;everely fined and puni&s;hed. The French court, therefore, be&s;ides the plea of inabi|lity, which they brought to excu&s;e them from the immediate payment, pretended to liquidate them according to the value originally received for them, alledging, that no time for their payment was &s;pecified in the duke de Choi&s;eul's declaration. The total &s;um of this paper currency was &s;aid to amount to about two millions and a half &s;terling; and the Engli&s;h merchants in&s;i&s;ted upon the notes they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of being either di&s;charged,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Demoli|tion of Dunkirk.</NOTE> The demolition of Dunkirk was another object in which the Briti&s;h mini&s;try at this time warmly intere&s;ted them&s;elves. The &s;hameful eva&s;ions of the French in performing this article after the treaty of Utrecht, and the more &s;hameful conni|vances of the whig mini&s;ters in England at that non-execution, were fre&s;h in the minds of the pub|lic. All the reproaches thrown out in former times on that account were now renewed; but the remon&s;trances of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were &s;o effec|tual, that in November the nation had authen|tic information that the cunet$e of Dunkirk was entirely filled up, excepting a trifling part, for which there was no earth; and that near three hundred men were employed in demoli&s;hing the king's ba&s;on there. Thus, in a few months, the mini&s;try under George the Third obliged the French court to do what they had either evaded or refu&s;ed to perform for above fifty years before.</P>

The French Je&s;uits and their partizans &s;till kept up their intere&s;t with the natives, and in&s;tigated them, e&s;pecially the Cherokee Indians, to ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Engli&s;h.

Though tho&s;e complaints were probably founded on the &s;ugge&s;tions of the French, yet the general a&s;&s;embly of the province of Pen&s;ylvania pa&s;&s;ed an act for preventing abu&s;es in the Indian trade, and for &s;trengthening peace and friend&s;hip with the northern Indians. Notwith&s;tanding this, and ma|ny other wi&s;e precautions, taken both in America and Great Britain to quiet the &s;avages, every di&s;|patch brought fre&s;h accounts of the inhuman ma&s;|&s;acres and deva&s;tations committed by them in the back-&s;ettlements of the Engli&s;h. In the &s;pring of the year 1763, the Six Nations, as they are called, had a meeting with the Delawares, and others of the &s;avage tribes, who &s;ent deputies to Hertford, in New-York, repre&s;enting that the lands on the Su&s;quehanna belonged to them; complaining that the Engli&s;h had begun to build &s;orts there, to extend their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as far as the we&s;tern &s;eas; and de|claring that, whatever pretended deeds might be produced, e&s;pecially by one Lydias, of their having di&s;po&s;ed of tho&s;e lands, they were re&s;olved to de|fend them to the la&s;t extremity.</P>

The eager forwardne&s;s of &s;ome young Indians prevented the total execution of this infernal de&s;ign, which they executed in part with amazing barbarity, and with a cun|ning and conduct of which they were thought to have been incapable The back-&s;ettlements were in&s;tantly filled with &s;avages from the neighbour|hood of Pitt&s;burgh, Sandu&s;ky, and Detroit, where they put all the defencele&s;s Engli&s;h to the &s;word.

Having inveigled, with fair pretences, one Mr. Colhoun to tru&s;t them, they plundered him, and killed ten of his people, he him&s;elf narrowly e&s;caping. In &s;hort, the de&s;ola|tion tho&s;e barbarians &s;pread was frightful; whole families were murdered, their corn and &s;tock of provi&s;ions de&s;troyed, the &s;ettlements for twenty miles were de&s;erted, and five hundred poor fami|lies, with women and children, who had the good fortune to e&s;cape, fled to the woods of Virginia, where they could find neither &s;helter nor &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence.</P>

A large body of them appeared before Fort Detroit, on pretence of holding a congre&s;s with major Glad|win, the commandant, who being on his guard, refu&s;ed to admit them, and put his garri&s;on under arms. Next day the &s;avages were joined by five hundred more of their own number, all armed, who demanded admittance into the fort. The comman|dant offered to admit forty; and they required to

They then practi&s;ed a great many arts to become ma&s;ters of the place, and to have carried it by &s;urprize. For this purpo&s;e, they cut off all the garri&s;ons of the out-po&s;ts, with tho&s;e of Pre&s;que I&s;le and St. Jo&s;eph; and &s;uddenly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the po&s;t of Michilimakinac, where they ma&s;&s;acred all the garri&s;on but two officers. The garri&s;on of Fort Detroit, which is no other than a &s;quare &s;tockade with four ba&s;tions, when the &s;avages appeared fir&s;t before it, con&s;i&s;ted of no more than eighty per&s;ons who carried arms, and thirty-four on board two ve&s;&s;els which enfiladed three &s;ides of the &s;quare, and &s;truck va&s;t terror into the Indians, who, however, &s;till continued the blockade. On the 30th of July, captain Dalyel, aid de camp to general Amher&s;t, arrived at the fort, and laid a plan for &s;urpri&s;ing the &s;avages, who were preparing to depart. The captain marched out with two hundred and forty-five men, attended by<NOTE PLACE="marg">and de|feat the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> two boats, with a patterero in each. At the di&s;|tance of two miles and a half from the fort they came up with the Indians, who were covered by brea&s;t-works&punc; and at fir&s;t received the Engli&s;h, who attacked them in the dark, with a bri&s;k regular fire, which did con&s;iderable execution. The de|tachment, however, with difficulty got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the works; but captain Dalyel &s;eeing it impracticable to hold them, made di&s;po&s;itions for a retreat, when he was killed by the &s;avages. The command devolved upon captain Grant who was &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide by a continua f$ e from the inclo&s;ures, that he was obliged to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They blockade Fort Pitt.</NOTE> The re&s;olute and regular behaviour of the &s;a|vages during this action, convinced the Engli&s;h that they were improved in their di&s;cipline; and they were confirmed in this opinion, by an action which happened two days after, between them and colonel Bouquet, who commanded a party &s;ent to the relief of Fort Pitt, formerly Fort du Que&s;ne, by Sir Jeffery Amher&s;t, the Briti&s;h commander in chief in America. The works of this important fort had never been completed, and had &s;uf|fered lately by an inundation. The &s;avages found it in this condition, and provided with a weak gar|ri&s;on, when they &s;urrounded it, with a de&s;ign to take it by famine. Being de&s;titute of all means of making regular approaches, they took po&s;t in the banks of the adjacent rivers, and blockaded it &s;o effectually, that they cut it off from all communications without, murdering all the me&s;&s;engers who were ca$ y$$g intelligence either to of from the fort In this de$perate &s;ituation, captain E$uyer, the Engli&s;h commandant, and his garri|&s;on, re&s;olved to die, rather than &s;urrender to &s;o inhuman an enemy; and di&s;po&s;$ions were made accordingly.

The colonel, in his march, could receive no intelligence of the enemy, who had po&s;ted them&s;elves in all pa&s;&s;es, and either killed all his me&s;&s;engers, or obliged them to return. By this it appeared that the Indians had excellent intelli|gence. When the colonel, on the 5th of Au|gu&s;t, came to Ligonier, he found it proper to leave the waggons, the powder, and the chief part of the &s;tores and provi&s;ions there; while he proceeded with the troops, and about three hundred and forty hor&s;es, loaded with flour. The Indians, by this time, had abandoned the blockade of Fort Pitt, to attack the Engli&s;h on their march, which lay through a dangerous defile, called Turtle Creek, extending &s;everal miles in length, with high rug|ged<NOTE PLACE="marg">They at|tack the Engli&s;h convoy,</NOTE> grounds on each &s;ide. While the colonel was preparing to pa&s;s this defile in the night-time, and while his men were refre&s;hing them&s;elves, after a fatiguing march of &s;eventeen miles, his advanced guard was &s;uddenly attacked by the &s;avages; but, being &s;peedily &s;upported, they were repul&s;ed, dri|ven from &s;ome of their po&s;ts, and pur&s;ued a con&s;i|derable way. Soon after the pur&s;uit cea&s;ed, the &s;avages returned to the attack, and appeared upon all the eminences round, from whence they kept up an ince&s;&s;ant fire upon the Engli&s;h, who gave them a general charge with their whole line. Though this di&s;lodged the &s;avages at fir&s;t, they
<PB N="271" REF="2790">
&s;oon recovered other heights, and thickened round<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> in &s;uch a manner, by means of fre&s;h reinforcements, that the convoy which was left in the rear of the Engli&s;h was in danger of being taken. The latter returned to protect it, and the engagement became general.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">but are repul&s;ed with diffi|culty.</NOTE> The &s;avages &s;upported their attempt with unpa|ralleled regularity and order, from one o'clock at noon till night; and then, with great difficulty, were repul&s;ed and driven from their po&s;ts, with fixed bayonets, though with con&s;iderable lo&s;s to the Engli&s;h, of whom above &s;ixty were killed or wounded. But this repul&s;e was far from being de|ci&s;ive. The Engli&s;h could do no more than to take po&s;t on the hill in &s;uch a manner as to &s;urround their convoy with their wounded, and cover them from the enemy, who formed an outer circle at the di&s;tance of about five hundred yards, where they emitted the mo&s;t terrible &s;houts and yells to intimi|date the Engli&s;h. In the morning they attacked the camp under an ince&s;&s;ant fire. It was in vain for the Engli&s;h to repel them, becau&s;e when pre&s;&s;ed they retired, but immediately returned to the charge with redoubled ardour; &s;o that the &s;itua|tion of the troops attacked was truly deplorable; galled by the fire of the &s;avages, fatigued by the preceding engagement, and faint and di&s;pirited through a total want of water. Had they attempt|ed to break through the enemy to have gained a more &s;ecure and comfortable &s;ituation, they mu&s;t have left their convoy to be plundered, and their
<PB N="272" REF="2800">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> wounded to be butchered; not to mention that they had lo&s;t many of their hor&s;es, and that the drivers of tho&s;e who remained were &s;o &s;tupified by their fears, that they &s;lunk into bu&s;hes, and were incapable of doing their duty. In the mean time, the fury of the &s;avages encrea&s;ed, and their attempts to break into the camp were more violent than ever; but &s;till, when pre&s;&s;ed, they kept aloof, that they might rally, and return with the greater effect. The Engli&s;h followed the only method that could be practi&s;ed for di&s;engaging them&s;elves, which was by making di&s;po&s;itions for an apparent retreat, and thereby encouraging the &s;avages to come to a clo&s;er engagement. Colonel Bouquet ordered two com|panies of his troops, who had been the mo&s;t ad|vanced in the engagement, to fall in with the cir|cle, and the troops on the right and left to open their files, as if to cover the retreat of the others; wh$$e another company of light infantry, and one of grenadiers, were directed to &s;upport the two fir&s;t companies. The &s;avages who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ground lately occupied by the two light infantry companies, drawing nearer at the &s;ame time to the center of the circle, thought them&s;elves &s;o &s;ecure of victory, that they pre&s;&s;ed on, but &s;till pouring i$ a heavy fire, till major Campbell, with the fir&s;t companies, from a part of the hill which they could not ob&s;erve, attacked their right flack; and being &s;econded by captain Ba&s;&s;et, from another quarter, the barbarians were every

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eng|li&s;h ar$ive at Fort Pitt.</NOTE> When the pur&s;uit of the Engli&s;h cea&s;ed, and the wood was cleared of the enemy, litters were made for the wounded, but the great$&s;t part of their flour and provi&s;ions was de&s;troyed for want of hor&s;es to carry them off. The Engli&s;h now proceeded about two miles farther, to a place call|ed Bu&s;hy Run; but, notwith&s;tanding the late de|feat, the &s;avages again attacked the Engli&s;h in their new camp, tho' l$&s;s vigorou&s;ly then be$ore; and being repul&s;ed, the troops continued their march till they arrived at Fort Pitt, in four days after their engagement. The lo&s;s which the Engli&s;h &s;u&s;tain|ed upon the whole was above an hundred killed and wounded, that of the &s;avages was not much greater, owing to their manner of fighting; tho' tho&s;e barbarians, who&s;e tribes are very thin, looked upon it as being very con&s;iderable. But though the two forts of Detroit and Pitt were thus &s;ecured, yet the war &s;till continued in other parts, and it is incredible with what fore&s;ight and re&s;olution they took their mea&s;ures in way-laying the convoys, or in &s;urpri&s;ing the parties of the Engli&s;h. When colonel Bouquet arrived at Fort Pitt, he found captain Ecuyer, who had been wounded in the leg, reduced almo&s;t to extremity, having rai&s;ed a parapet of logs around the fort, by the help only of a few &s;hip-wrights, and taken every other imaginable precau|tion, for the &s;afety of the place. Upon the whole, though the improvement of the &s;avages in the art of war was a melancholy con&s;ideration to the Eng|li&s;h, yet it was &s;ome comfort to the latter, to learn

La&s;tly, every In|dian trader was to take out a licence from the re|&s;pective governors for carrying on commerce with the Indians.</P>
<P>Though the wi&s;dom, and, indeed, the nece&s;&s;ity, of tho&s;e regulations, were evident, at the fir&s;t &s;ight, yet they did not fail to rai&s;e an outery again&s;t the government, as if the mo&s;t valuable part of the Engli&s;h acqui&s;itions on the continent had been left in the hands of the &s;avages, by which the French would always have it in their power to renew their treacherous intrigues and practices; and the Indian war which broke out &s;oon after the conclu&s;ion of the peace, &s;eemed to give too much colour for &s;uch allegations. But when the mea&s;ure is rightly con&s;idered, it is rather a regulation, than a relin|qui&s;hment, of territory; for, in fact, all the lands re&s;erved for the Indians, and, indeed, all the con|que&s;ts made by the Engli&s;h during the cour&s;e of the late war, were comprehended in former grants and charters, which had no other boundaries to the we&s;tward but the South Sea.

<P>The government of Quebec was given to the honourable James Murray, E&s;q&punc; who had de&s;erved it by the courage he had exerted in the conque&s;t, and the conduct he had ob&s;erved in the pre$erva|tion, of that important province. James Grant, E&s;q. obtained the government of Ea&s;t, as George John&s;ton, E&s;q. did that of We&s;t Florida, and Ro|bert Melvill, E&s;q. had that of Grenada conferred on him. Tho&s;e appointments were, by all men of candour and judgment, thought to be ju&s;tly due to the merits and &s;ervices of the gentlemen to whom they were allotted; each of whom had particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the reduction of the pro|vince over which he was appointed governor; but the tools of oppo&s;ition loaded the government with the mo&s;t illiberal abu&s;e, without a&s;&s;igning any other rea&s;on than that the gentlemen thus di&s;tingui&s;hed were all of them natives of Scotland, though in other re&s;pects they were allowed by calumny it&s;elf to be unexceptionable, both in their civil and military capacities.

the governor's hou&s;e. This alarming appear|ance<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> cau&s;ed &s;ome of the merchants of the place to reproach them with their behaviour; but they were treated with contempt, and pelted with &s;tones. Some of the officers interfered, and drew their &s;words; upon which the &s;oldiers ran to their bar|racks, and putting them&s;elves under arms, march|ed in order, with drums beating, to St. John's gate. They had, by this time, cho&s;en a com|mander of their own number, and had even di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed their &s;erjeants and corporals. They declared they would injure none of the inhabitants; but that as it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon their pay without their provi&s;ions, they were determin|ed to march by Montreal to New-York, that they might obtain redre&s;s from general Amher&s;t. The moderation with which the mutineers proceeded rendered the governor's &s;ituation the more critical, as it &s;hewed that they had formed a plan which they were determined to follow. He was returning from vi&s;iting &s;ome po&s;ts of the garri&s;on, attended by a few officers and &s;erjeants, when he met the mutineers in their march, preceded by two pieces of cannon. It required an equal degree of pru|dence and re&s;olution to act properly on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; for when he and his attendants endea|voured to &s;top them, &s;ome of the mo&s;t hot-headed of the mutineers di&s;charged their pieces, but with|out doing any execution, declaring at the &s;ame time, that they would hear nothing to divert them from their re&s;olution; and even &s;triking &s;ome of the officers who oppo&s;ed them by force. The men,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> in general, behaved with far more temper; they profe&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t love and e&s;teem for their ge|neral and their officers, but repeated their griev|ance, and appeared determined to proceed on their march.</P>
<P>During this parley, the governor had been joined by all the officers in the garri&s;on; and lieutenant Mills, the town major, had taken care to &s;hut the gates of the town. The night being very dark, this expo&s;ed the inhabitants to be plundered, if the men &s;hould di&s;per&s;e within the walls. At la&s;t the governor, &s;econded by his officers, prevailed with them to march back to the grand parade, where he addre&s;&s;ed them file by file; but they &s;till &s;eemed to per&s;i&s;t in their re&s;olution not to &s;erve without provi&s;ions, and all he could do was to per&s;uade them to march to their barracks, till he could have an opportunity to repre&s;ent their grievances to the commander in chief. When they complied with this request, they repeated their prote&s;tations of loyalty and per&s;onal e&s;teem for their officers; but &s;eemed as determined as ever to execute their pur|po&s;e. Next day they mounted guard as u&s;ual, in good order, while general Murray took that oppor|tunity of a&s;&s;embling together the commi&s;&s;ioned and non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers. To them he re|pre&s;ented the danger of a mutiny in the &s;tronge&s;t Briti&s;h garri&s;on in America, an example which, un|doubtedly, would be followed by all the troops on that continent; and that, for his own part, he was re&s;olved either to reduce the men to their duty, or to peri&s;h in the attempt. After con&s;ultation, it was agreed, that the milde&s;t mea&s;ures &s;hould be

u&s;ed, and accordingly all that and part of the &s;uc|ceeding<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> day was &s;pent by the officers in endeavour|ing to reduce the men to their duty, tho' without any vi&s;ible effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is quelled by governor Murray.</NOTE> The general now thought it was high time to bring this dangerous affair to a cri&s;is by a deci&s;ive effort. In the evening of the 20th, the governor, after harranguing each battalion &s;eparately, in an affecting but manly manner, ordered all the garri|&s;on to be under arms next day on the grand pa|rade. They obeyed, and the good effects of his remon&s;trances &s;oon appeared. He him&s;elf read to them the articles of war, repeated his repre&s;enta|tions on their enormous conduct, and declared, that he was re&s;olved, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his officers, ei|ther to reduce them to their duty, or to die by their hands. He then po&s;ted him&s;elf at the head of Am|her&s;t's grenadiers, with an air that be&s;poke him de|termined to put the fir&s;t man to death who &s;hould refu&s;e to obey him; and ordered them, in token of their compliance, to march between two royal co|lours planted for that purpo&s;e. The grenadiers obeyed, the re&s;t of the garri&s;on followed their ex|ample, while all of them expre&s;&s;ed &s;orrow for their pa&s;t behaviour; upon which the governor re&s;tored them to their colours, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfac|tion in their having recovered their characters as good &s;oldiers. This affair being tran&s;mitted to England, it was found, upon enquiry, that matters had been mi&s;repre&s;ented to the government, who were induced to believe, that the allowances might have been deducted without injuring the garri&s;on of Quebec.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Proceed|ings in the Iri&s;h par|liament about pen&s;ions.</NOTE> On the 20th of October the earl of Northumber|land, lord lieutenant of Ireland, arrived at Dublin, where great pains had been taken to exa&s;perate the public of all degrees again&s;t the large &s;ums of mo|ney that had been granted in pen&s;ions on that e&s;tabli&s;hment. A li&s;t of tho&s;e pen&s;ions was obtain|ed, &s;pecifying the particular per&s;ons to whom they had been granted; and it appeared that, exclu&s;ive of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the pen&s;ions granted to French people, they amounted annually to the &s;um of 72002 l. tho&s;e of the military e&s;tab|li&s;hment to 2400 l. and the &s;um granted to French pen&s;ioners, who had been upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment ever &s;ince the death of George the Fir&s;t, to 920 l. 17 s. It was alledged that the&s;e pen&s;ions had been doubled &s;ince the year 1756, and that a con&s;idera|ble part of the &s;um total had been impo&s;ed &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty. Great pains were taken to prove that the unalienable revenues of the crown, and the temporary as well as the he|reditary duties of Ireland, were legally applicable to public purpo&s;es only. That the three branches of the Iri&s;h revenue, the pri&s;age on wines, light&punc;hou&s;e duties, and the ca&s;ual revenue, the only funds from which pen&s;ions can be legally i&s;&s;ued, do no$ amount to 15,000 l.

the lord&punc;lieutenant, taking notice of the late riot|ous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> proceedings, recommending the &s;upport of the Prote&s;tant charter-&s;chools, and of the linnen manu|facture. After they had gone through the u&s;ual<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motions rejected.</NOTE> forms of addre&s;&s;es and other bu&s;ine&s;s, they moved for an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, to give orders to his attorney-general to bring a writ of &s;cire facias, to enquire into the legality of the patent by which the office of chancellor of the exchequer of that kingdom was then held. Though this motion was in effect lo&s;t by the con&s;ideration of its being put off to a long day, yet the hou&s;e proceeded to other bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;hewed them to be by no means in|&s;en&s;ible of what they conceived to be their griev|ances, particularly with regard to the pen&s;ions we have mentioned. One of 1000 l. a year had been granted to George Charles, E&s;q. on the 15th of the preceding July, for the term of thirty-one years, in tru&s;t, (it was alledged), for the Sardinian mini&s;ter, as a reward for his negotiating the late treaty of peace with France and Spain; therefore a motion was made for an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty to recall it, which pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. Other general motions again&s;t the grants of pen&s;ions were likewi&s;e made, but mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>This did not di&s;courage Mr. Perry, a leading member of the commons, from moving for an ad|dre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, expre&s;&s;ing, that their plea&s;ing hopes of the national debt being reduced, and the people ea&s;ed of their heavy taxes, were "bla&s;t|ed by the unexpected requi&s;ition of &s;upplies to &s;up|port a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, loaded with a long train of pen&s;ions, the amount of which, exclu&s;ive of the

That the number of officers upon the military e&s;tabli&s;hment was increa&s;ed, not only far beyond what it ever was in time of peace, but even beyond what it was in the time of the mo&s;t dangerous war; and would, under any reign but that of his maje&s;ty, rai&s;e ju&s;t appre|hen&s;ions for the con&s;titution not only of this king|dom, but of Great Britain. That, in&s;tead of &s;ix regiments of dragoons, and twenty-&s;ix of foot, the mo&s;t ever &s;een in this kingdom, there are now $ight regiments of dragoons and thirty of foot, be|&s;ides the four old regiments of hor&s;e. That the expence of general officers is rai&s;ed from 32,000 l. in two years, to 45,000 l. though there was not a &s;ufficient number of them in this kingdom to at|tend the la&s;t reduction of the forces. That the ex|pence of the ordnance is $welled from 10,600 l. in two years, to 45,700 l. independent of its extraor|dinary charges, which are very con&s;iderable; tho' the whole artillery of this kingdom is not equal to the ordnance of one of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war of thirty guns. That every other branch of the military and civil e&s;tabli&s;hments are advanced near|ly in the &s;ame proportion."</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this addre$s is filled with the like plaintive matter. The patrons of it pretended, that, in two years, the military e&s;tabli&s;hment a|mounted to the &s;um of n ne hundred and eighty thou&s;and three hundred and fifty-five pounds $word$ &s;hillings. "The civil e&s;tabli&s;hment to two

So that, (continued the propo&s;ed ad|dre&s;s) the expence of the nation for the&s;e two years mu&s;t exceed its whole revenue in a &s;um of three hundred and fourteen thou&s;and two hundred and forty-eight pounds nine &s;hillings and nine pence; which deficiency being added to the national debt, mu&s;t leave this kingdom, at the next meeting of parliament, near one million in debt." The ad|dre&s;s concluded with a reque&s;t, that the circum|&s;tances of the Iri&s;h might be laid before his maje&s;ty, who&s;e wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and humanity, would not permit the utter ruin of a dutiful, loyal, and affecti|onate people. It was plainly &s;een that this inflamma|tory, but plau&s;ible, addre&s;s had a mo&s;t dangerous tendency; and therefore the motion for it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative, greatly to the &s;atisfaction of all who wi&s;hed well to the two kingdoms. The debates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates upon the above ad|dre&s;s.</NOTE> on this occa&s;ion were keen, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, per|&s;onal; but the advocates for the government car|ried their point by unan&s;werably proving, that, as Ireland had, in no perceptible degree, been burdened with the expences of the late war, that had co&s;t &s;o many millions to Great Britain, a great part of which had been laid out for the protection of the Iri&s;h ter|ritory and commerce; and as, from the encourage|ment &s;he received from England, &s;he was then in a flouri&s;hing and re&s;pectable condition; it was there|fore ju&s;t, that, in time of peace, &s;he &s;hould contri|bute

During the cour&s;e of this year, mo&s;t of the trading cities in Germany were greatly affected by a cour&s;e of bankruptcies, which began at Am&s;terdam, by the failure of two brothers called Neufville, for above 330,000 l. and a Jew, who broke for near 40,000 l. Eighteen hou&s;es at Am&s;terdam &s;topped payment, as did a much greater number at Hamburgh.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> In the mean while it was remarkable, that the credit of the Engli&s;h merchants, at London e&s;pecially, received but a very incon&s;iderable &s;hock on this occa&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the fatal expediti|on of the Lord Clive and Ambu&s;|cade pri|vateers.</NOTE> Upon the breaking out of the war with Spain, &s;ome private merchants and adventurers fitted out two &s;hips called the Lord Clive and the Ambu&s;|cade privateers. The former, being equal in force to a &s;hip of fifty guns, was commanded by one captain M'Namara, who was e&s;teemed as a brave experienced officer, and he was to be joined by other &s;hips, particularly a Portugue&s;e frigate, to proceed on an expedition to the South Seas. In December 1762, the whole &s;quadron arrived in the river Plata, which they found much better prepar|ed to receive them than they had imagined. After reconnoitring the river, it was re&s;olved to attack the colony of San Sacrament, or Nova Colonia, which the Spaniards, &s;ome time before, had taken from the Portugue&s;e. Though this was, by many, of the crew, con&s;idered as a de&s;perate enterprize, yet the adventurers, having their whole fortunes at &s;take, and the expectation of the public being ve|ry high, the attack was re&s;olved on.

It was more important for its &s;itu|ation than for its riches, as it lay the mo&s;t conve|nient of all the South Sea Spani&s;h &s;ettlements for acting again&s;t the Portugue&s;e; and &s;hould it fall in|to the hands of the Engli&s;h, mu&s;t be an effectual curb upon the Span$ards in that part of the globe. Be&s;ides the three &s;hips already mentioned, the &s;qua|dron was attended by &s;ome &s;mall armed ve&s;&s;els and &s;tore-&s;hips; the complement of Briti&s;h &s;ailors and &s;oldiers on board being about five hundred, ex|clu&s;ive of the Portugue&s;e. The expedition was originally planned for getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Buenos Ayres; but finding the navigation of the river ve|ry difficult, they re&s;olved, before they proceeded farther, to attack Nova Colonia; an Engli&s;h pilot, whom they found on board a Portugue&s;e &s;hip, un|dertaking to bring the commodore within pi&s;tol|&s;hot of the chief battery on &s;hore. On the $th of January 1763, the Lord Clive made the &s;ignal for engaging, and &s;oon after anchored under the fire of the ea&s;tmo&s;t battery of the place, while the Am|bu&s;cade was &s;everely handled by the fire of the middle and we&s;tmo&s;t batteries, and from &s;ome Spa|ni&s;h frigates. As u&s;ual, in tho&s;e ca&s;es, the plan of engagement was not exactly followed; and the Portugue&s;e frigate, on which they had great de|pendence, anchored at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that none of her &s;hot reached the &s;hore. After &s;everal mi&s;|takes had been rectified, a mo&s;t fierce cannonading began on both &s;ides, which la&s;ted from eleven in the forenoon till three in the afternoon, when the enemy's fire, that had been before kept up very

In this &s;tate of the engagement, when the Engli&s;h expected every moment to &s;ee the Spani&s;h colours &s;truck, the Lord Clive was found to be on fire, by &s;ome accident which never has been ac|counted for. No &s;ooner did the flames appear, than it was ea&s;y to perceive that it was impo&s;&s;ible to extingui&s;h them. In an in&s;tant the attack was di&s;continued: the Ambu&s;cade, with va&s;t difficulty, got clear of the other &s;hip's flames, but was little better than a wreck, having received a great num|ber of &s;hot between wind and water, and none le&s;s than twenty-four pounders. As to the crew of the Lord Clive, &s;ome peri&s;hed in the water, &s;ome in the flames, and many by the enemy's fire, which re|commenced on the occa&s;ion. Some of the wound|ed, through de&s;pair and torture, di&s;patched them|&s;elves; and many, finding all hopes of e&s;caping vain, ran to the lower guns, from whence they kept up a con&s;tant fire, till they were involved in the common calamity; &s;o that no more than &s;eventy-eight of three hundred and forty, the complement of the &s;hip when the engagement began, e&s;caped with their lives, the &s;hip blowing up about eight in the evening.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debate upon</NOTE> It was farther urged, that &s;uch a re&s;olution was premature, as neither the city of London nor any other city or borough corporate in Great Britain had &s;et them the example: that it was dictatorial, becau&s;e they thereby &s;tept forth to alarm the peo|ple, and to declare that the principles of liberty have been attacked, and the rights of the &s;ubject invaded; facts of which they pre&s;umed to be the judges, by be&s;towing their freedom as a reward for their defence and protection. It was in&s;ulting, be|cau&s;e the commonalty of Dublin thereby interfer|ed in an affair which belonged to a &s;eparate and a &s;uperior kingdom; an affair in which the Iri&s;h were not principals, and in which their taking the lead impired a tacit reproach upon the people of Great Britain, as if they were in&s;en&s;ible of the danger which they had e&s;caped thro' the &s;ea&s;onable firm|ne&s;$ of that great magi&s;trate, by neglecting to re|ward him according to his &s;ervices.

This an&s;wer &s;et the commons in a flame; the admini&s;tra|tions in both kingdoms were loaded with the mo&s;t opprobrious abu&s;e; and it was affirmed that, ever &s;ince the freedom of the guild had been voted to that great man, the tools of power had been inde|fatigable in preventing its taking place in the city: that among tho&s;e tools were &s;ome men in the mo&s;t &s;acred &s;tations; and that the commons of Dublin could not be too vigorous in clearing them&s;elves from the &s;u&s;picion of all &s;ini&s;ter intentions.

It then took notice, that the city of Dublin and kingdom of Ireland owed to lord chief ju&s;tice Pratt the benefit of the act of the 31&s;t of his late maje&s;ty, for better &s;upplying that city with corn and flour; and concluded with praying, That the lord mayor and aldermen would pre&s;ent the &s;aid lord chief ju&s;tice Pratt, the great a&s;&s;ertor of the rights of king and people, with the freedom of their city in a gold box.</P>

Tho&s;e zealous pro|ceedings in the common-council of London were intended as a &s;ignal for the re&s;t of the nation to fol|low their example, and met with a &s;trong oppo&s;i|tion.

It was therefore &s;aid, that the thanks of the court ought rather to have been voted to the members who thought tho&s;e endea|vours to be uncon&s;titutional; that the laws of the land ought not to be influenced by any part of the legi&s;lature; and therefore had voted for an adjourn|ment of the con&s;ideration concerning the illegality of the aforementioned warrants to a di&s;tant day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and im|proper.</NOTE> The &s;ame court exhorting their repre&s;entatives to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;ecure the hou&s;es, pa|pers, and per&s;ons of the &s;ubject from arbitrary and illegal violations, was deemed to be highly ab&s;urd, when it was notorious that one of tho&s;e repre&s;enta|tives had oppo&s;ed a bill for e&s;tabli&s;hing by law the illegality of the warrants objected to; and that the fir&s;t lord-commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the debate for bringing in this bill, and &s;hewed him&s;elf willing to agree with the gentlemen in the oppo&s;ition on that head. It was urged that the con&s;ideration of the legality or illegality of the war|rants by virtue of the exceptions that had been tak|en at Mr. Wood's trial (the under &s;ecretary of &s;tate) would come before the bench of judges. If that bench was unanimous in pronouncing them to be illegal, the end was an&s;wered, without having re|cour&s;e to a new law; but if it &s;hould be divided, a law was propo&s;ed by the admini&s;tration it&s;elf, for

Upon the whole, it was ob&s;erved, that the que&s;tion &s;o much applauded by the addre&s;s was only intended to &s;erve a particular purpo&s;e; and that tho&s;e who &s;upported it, were actually not in earne&s;t in obtain|ing a remedy for the evils they had &s;o pathetically bewailed, otherwi&s;e they never would have reject|ed the &s;anction of an act of parliament to prevent them for the future.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Replied to&punc;</NOTE> To tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, it was replied, That no regard was had to the objection brought by the friends of Mr. Wilkes again&s;t the hou&s;e proceed|ing upon an enquiry into his offence, while he was under pro&s;ecution for it in the courts below, at the &s;uit of the crown, and for the hou&s;e delaying their judgment till the record office conviction &s;hould be brought up to it, which would have been a proper ground of their proceeding again&s;t him; whereas by cen&s;uring him before &s;uch record could be ob|tained, the court and jury would be under an un|due influence. To this it was an&s;wered, That the hou&s;e of commons, in their proceeding again&s;t Mr. Wilkes, had done no more than explain a point of their own privileges, which had no concern with the common law; that the lords had concurred with them in their proceedings; that all po&s;&s;ible indulgence had been given him, and that no $i|gorous &s;tep had been taken again&s;t him, till he had actually withdrawn him&s;elf from public ju&s;tice of every kind; and that the lords and commons had as much authority as any one chief of the law could have in determining the nature and extent of par|liamentary privilege.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="3210">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> It was urged by the defenders of the minority in &s;upport of the motion they had made, that Sir John Phillips, who was to have brought in the bill, was not in earne&s;t; and that, as they held a general warrant for apprehending and &s;eizing the authors, printers, and publi&s;hers of a &s;editious libel to be illegal, they could not vote for a bill to re|gulate an illegality. To this it was replied, That they had no right to judge of any member's inten|tions before they found them to be incon&s;i&s;tent with his profe&s;&s;ions; and that the admini&s;tration could not give a better te&s;t of their &s;incerity than by propo&s;ing a bill which was to declare tho&s;e war|rants to be illegal, even if they &s;hould be declared otherwi&s;e by a majority of the judges. We have been the more particular in recapitulating the&s;e matters, as the que&s;tion concerning the motion made in the hou&s;e of commons was revived with great acrimony by the minority on the above occa|&s;ion, and &s;upported by all the &s;kill and abilities of the party. The motion for the addre&s;s met with no material oppo&s;ition in the common-council, and it an&s;wered the main end which its friends had in view.

To this high compliment, which was tran&s;mitted to his lord&s;hip by the town-clerk, a mo&s;t re&s;pectful an&s;wer was returned, and afterwards printed and indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated all over the nation.</P>

This office-privilege, which was attended with great emoluments, ap|peared to be more detrimental to the revenue than the parliamentary privilege it&s;elf; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary for a government, which valued it&s;elf upon oeconomy, to check tho&s;e abu&s;es, and to re|gulate the privilege.</P>

It was enacted, That from and after the 1&s;t of May 1764, while the revenue of the po&s;t-office &s;hall continue to be carried to the aggregate fund, no letters or packets &s;hall be exempted from po&s;tage but &s;uch as are &s;ent to or from the king; or &s;uch as, not exceeding two ounces in weight, &s;hall be &s;igned on the out&s;ide by a member of either hou&s;e, the whole of the &s;u|per&s;cription being his own writing, or &s;uch as &s;hall be directed to him at his u&s;ual re&s;idence, or place where he &s;hall then be, or at either hou&s;e of parlia|ment, all letters and packets to the lord high trea&s;urer, or commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;ecretaries to the trea&s;ury; lord high admiral, commi&s;&s;ioners, and

That nobleman, in his memorial to the king, de&s;ired from his maje&s;ty a grant of the whole i&s;land of St. John's, in the gulph of St. Lawrence, to hold the &s;ame in &s;ee of the crown for ever, as one entire county (which i&s;land is &s;uppo&s;ed and e&s;timated to contain two millions of acres of land, be the &s;ame more or lets) with all manner of rights, royalties, privileges, franchi&s;es, and appurtenances what&s;oever, with all civil and criminal juri&s;diction, and all manner of courts as in England, and with power to appoint or commi&s;&s;ion from time to time all manner of officers for the exerci&s;e of the &s;aid juri&s;diction, and for ordering the government thereof.

All officers were to be appointed or removed with the king's approbation, and the power of arms was to be regulated according to the antient and com|mon law in England; that is, the earl, his &s;heriff, or deputy, was to call together the number of men which, by tenure and common &s;occage, were to be furni&s;hed for the defence of the &s;aid i&s;land.

That learned body, during the late reign, had been remarkable for their attachment, and, as their enemies &s;aid, for their &s;ervility, to government; but, when their chancellor the duke of Newca&s;tle lo&s;t his power in the admini&s;tration, their ardour cooled, and the principles of many of the members received a re|markable change.

The thinking part of the nation, however, was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible, that this fall was owing to the rapaciou&s;|ne&s;s and avarice of certain per&s;ons who kept up their money in hopes that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the go|vernment would oblige the mini&s;try to give an ex|orbitant price for &s;upplies. An outcry was like|wi&s;e rai&s;ed on account of the debt that was not funded. To this it was an&s;wered, that it would be injurious to the nation to pa&s;s every account, or to give parliamentary &s;ecurity for every bill that was brought to the trea&s;ury, by way of public debt; that the immen&s;e demands for the war in Germa|ny required the &s;evere&s;t &s;$rutiny before they were pa&s;&s;ed, and that it was highly rea&s;onable to po&s;t|pone them till they were examined.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tion,</NOTE> The accounts which were daily received from America gave a handle for continuing the outcry again&s;t the government, as if the admini&s;tration in England had been accountable for all the barbari|ties committed there. That the French prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits did not &s;pirit up the Indians to ho&s;tili|ties again&s;t the Engli&s;h can &s;carcely be doubted; and it is certain that animo&s;ities among the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects them&s;elves proceeded to a great height. The Conne&s;taga Indians were the remains of a tribe of the Six Nations, &s;ettled at that place, within the limits of Pen&s;ylvania, but they were reduced to a very &s;mall number. Their harmle&s;s ho&s;pitable behaviour towards the Engli&s;h could not, however

protect them from a ma&s;&s;acre almo&s;t unheard of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> among Chri&s;tians. A certain &s;implicity of behavi|our had endeared them to the Quakers, by whom they were care&s;&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the many bar|barous ma&s;&s;acres committed by other Indians, on the frontiers of the province. Some re&s;entful &s;pirits a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves under the term of the Paxton Volunteers, and came to the inhuman re&s;olution of putting tho&s;e harmle&s;s Cone&s;taga Indians to death. They alledged in defence of their barba|rity, that near a thou&s;and families had been driven from their habitations by the Indian incur&s;ions, and obliged to throw them&s;elves upon the humanity of the inhabitants in the more inland parts of the province, who gave them but a very cold recep|tion, though they &s;hewed all imaginable tender|ne&s;s to the Cone&s;taga, and other, Indians. It was even alledged that they carried their kindne&s;s &s;o far, as to relieve the &s;avages who had been the mo&s;t active again&s;t colonel Bouquet during the late war.

After the ma&s;&s;acre had been committed, the murderers &s;et fire to the huts. When the Indians returned
<PB N="324" REF="3340">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> to their habitations, the con&s;ternation, grief, and horror with which they beheld the murdered, half|burnt bodies of their relations, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. The magi&s;trates of Lanca&s;ter county, where the tragedy was acted, gave them all the con&s;olation in their power, and lodged them in their work|hou&s;e, as a place of &s;afety, promi&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, to protect them. The white people in the neighbourhood commi&s;erated and bewailed their fate, and the governor of Pen&s;ylvania i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, requiring all magi&s;trates and others to do their utmo&s;t in di&s;covering and &s;ecuring the murderers, and prohibiting all farther injuries to the Indians of the province. This had no effect upon the inhuman murderers. Hearing that about fourteen of the little tribe were &s;till alive, fifty of the Paxton Volunteers, on the 27th of December, a&s;&s;embled, and marched to the workhou&s;e, which they broke open, and entered it with looks that &s;uf|ficiently denoted their bloody intentions. The poor wretches endeavoured to avert their fate by falling on their knees, holding forth their little ones to plead for compa&s;&s;ion, and earne&s;tly declar|ing their love for the Engli&s;h. All was ineffectual; every one of them was butchered on the &s;pot; after which the mon&s;ters mounted their hor&s;es, and went off with loud huzzas, as if they had gain|ed a victory. Tho&s;e inhumanities were the more barbarous, as the murdered Indians had &s;o intire an affection for the Engli&s;h, that, when they were warned of their danger, they refu&s;ed to take any precaution for their own &s;afety. Another procla|mation was i&s;&s;ued for di&s;covering the murderers,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;tinacy of the in|&s;urgents.</NOTE> The Paxton Volunteers made but a poor apolo|gy for tho&s;e barbarities, by publi&s;hing a remon|&s;trance, in which they petition'd their governor, that all Indians &s;hould be removed out of the pro|vince, and that public rewards &s;hould be propo&s;ed for their &s;calps, as being the mo&s;t likely means for de&s;troying or reducing them to rea&s;on, and that no trade &s;hould be carried on with them, till all the Engli&s;h in captivity were relea&s;ed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Europe.</NOTE> Though the Au&s;trian hereditary dominions had been exhau&s;ted of men during the late war, yet it is certain that the empire never was known to abound &s;o much in gold and &s;ilver &s;pecie, as when it was fini&s;hed. This was a lucky circum&s;tance for the princes of that empire, who employed their &s;everal prerogatives in multiplying money, by a$ulterat|ing the coinage; but however profitable it might be for them, it proved fatal to their &s;ubjects, be|cau&s;e it ruined all their foreign credit. The queen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Germa|ny.</NOTE> of Hungary acknowledged that &s;he had lo&s;t half a million of men during the war, and publi&s;hed edicts, offering lands to all who were inclined to &s;ettle in the bannat of Teme&s;war, Tran&s;ylvania, and Hun|gary,

On the 10th of May, a &s;eparate act was publi&s;hed at Berlin, &s;igned by the plenipotentiaries of the queen of Hungary and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, which gave ri&s;e to various &s;peculations. At the time of the treaty of Hubert&s;burg, which was dat|ed the 15th of February, 1763, the court of Vien|na was &s;o much out of humour with its allies, and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia with his, that they were not in|cluded in that treaty. Both parties perceiving that this &s;ilent mark of di&s;&s;atisfaction made no impre&s;|&s;ion upon the powers concerned, and that the peace was cemented between France and Great Britain, they thought proper to publi&s;h this act, by which the French king, with the kings of Sweden and Po|land, the princes and &s;tates of the empire, were in|cluded on the part of the empre&s;s-queen; and the king of Great Britain, the duke of Brun&s;wic-Lu|nenburg, and the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, on the part of Pru&s;&s;ia; but the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia was included by both. About this time the court of Vienna had &s;ome thoughts of making a farther reduction of its troops, but the motions of the Turks, and the &s;tate of affairs in Poland, prevented it; and, in&s;tead of reducing, her imperial maje&s;ty augment|ed, her armies, but at the &s;ame time &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed all the officers who had mi&s;behaved in the late war.</P>
<P>During tho&s;e tran&s;actions, an extraordinary inci|dent happened in Germany, where the troops of H$&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt, on a di&s;gu&s;t which they had re|ceived

It was thought that this in&s;ult would have &s;haken the peace of Germany, e&s;pecially as &s;everal other cities were equally liable to the &s;ame in&s;ults, for the &s;ame rea&s;on. The inhabitants &s;ent a me|morial of what had happened to the diet at Rati&s;|bon, and likewi&s;e complained to the college of ci|ties; but the affair was at la&s;t compromi&s;ed by the prudence of the imperial court, without any farther bad con&s;equences. Towards the clo&s;e of the year 1763, the court of Rome gave an uncommon proof of its impartiality by its deci&s;ion in the great appeal concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the bi&s;hopric of Liege. The candidates were the count d'Outre|mont and prince Clement of Saxony. The former had a clear majority of voices in his favour, but the courts of Vienna and France intere&s;ting them|&s;elves &s;trongly for prince Clement, the affair was carried to Rome, where the pope confirmed Outre|mont's election; and the election of the king of the Romans being then in agitation, that count was &s;uffered to take quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;overeignty. Their imperial maje&s;ties likewi&s;e prevented, with great prudence, a mi&s;under&s;tanding that was likely to ari&s;e between the chapter of O&s;naburgh and his Britannic maje&s;ty, on account of the admini&s;tration of that bi&s;hopric during the nonage of his &s;on, who&s;e turn it was to &s;ucceed to it by the treaty of We&s;tphalia.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="3380">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the other great power of Germany, was equally a&s;&s;iduous in cultivating the public tranquility, and re peopling his dominions after the war. Upon his return to his capital, he was received as the guardian-angel of his country. He publi&s;hed an amne&s;ty and general pardon to all his &s;ubjects whatever, excepting the baron War|kot&s;ch, who had formed a plot to deliver him up to the queen of Hungary. By another proclamation he gave freedom to all the pea&s;ants of Sile&s;ia and Pomerania, who, till that time, were upon the &s;ame footing with the antient Engli&s;h villains, and were bought and &s;old with the e&s;tates; be&s;ides making many other regulations equally prudent and humane for the benefit of his &s;ubjects. After hav|ing given way to ju&s;tice in the trial and puni&s;h|ment of his mi&s;behaving officers, he &s;et out on a progre&s;s through his dominions; and, having ju&s;t touch'd at Hanover, he returned to Berlin. His court never was known to be &s;o brilliant as at this time, and he affected an unu&s;ual magnificence in entertaining a Turki&s;h emba&s;&s;ador who had been &s;ome time at Berlin. This created great &s;pecu|lation among the other powers of Europe; but it was &s;oon under&s;tood that this politic prince meant no more than to make the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;en&s;ible that he had great intere&s;t at the Porte.

Sometimes he complained of the inju&s;tice that had been done him, and demanded the arrears that were due to him from Great Britain; but all demands of that kind were treated with &s;ilent contempt. Sometimes his mini&s;ter who re&s;ided in London formed connections with the party that was in op|po&s;ition to the court, and endeavoured to embroil the proceedings of parliament; but finding all his endeavours un&s;ucce&s;sful, and that his popularity daily declined, for rea&s;ons that are foreign to this hi&s;tory, he obtained his recall.</P>

The Dutch were obliged to put up with the&s;e requi&s;itions, which they by no means expect|ed, and the French proceeded to prohibit the im|portation of all &s;alt-fi&s;h by other nations into&punc; their kingdom. Notice of this was given not only to the Dutch, but to the Danes and the Swedes, inti|mating at the &s;ame time, that, as the prohibition was general to all nations, no particular people had a right to take it ami&s;s. In June his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty ordered an account to be brought in of all the freeholds of his kingdom, that the taxes of his people might be more equally proportioned; and made many other &s;alutary regulations.</P>

Arti|cles of impeachment again&s;t the duke of Fitz James were pre&s;ented by the parliament of Thoulou&s;e, and they were drawn up in a &s;train that would have done honour to the noble&s;t periods of antiquity.

This affair, however, was not the only point of difference between the court and parliaments of France.

Not &s;atisfied with this, orders were i&s;&s;ued for the peers to be &s;ummoned to deliberate farther on the matter, and the king him&s;elf was invited to be pre&s;ent; but his an&s;wer was, that he had already puni&s;hed the archbi&s;hop by bani&s;hing him, and it was his plea|&s;ure that they &s;hould proceed no farther again&s;t him.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion of the Dutch negroes in America.</NOTE> In July 1763, the government of Holland re|ceived an account that the negroes belonging to their colony of the Berbices, in South America, had rebelled in the month of the preceding February, and had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of all the planta|tions in that &s;ettlement excepting three. At fir&s;t great pains were taken by &s;ome who wanted to pa&s;s for Dutch patriots, to fix the infamy of this revolt upon the Engli&s;h, who&s;e behaviour &s;oon convinced the public of the fal&s;ity of the report. The ne|groes, at fir&s;t, murdered all the white men who fell into their hands. The in&s;urrection broke out in a plantation called Magdalenburgh, where about twenty whites were killed, none e&s;caping but tho&s;e who got on board four ve&s;&s;els that lay in the river, and carried them to Cura&s;&s;oa. Tho&s;e planters who wanted to &s;ecrete their &s;laves were either put to death, or obliged to &s;uffer them to join in the in|&s;urrection; and at la&s;t the rebellion became general. A hundred of the Dutch militia recovered two of $word$ plantations, and put the rebels to $$$ght.
<PB N="335" REF="3450">
The proceedings of tho&s;e negroes were barbar|ous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> beyond expre&s;&s;ion. Some of the planters were cut in pieces, bit by bit, and the mo&s;t favoured had a &s;pike drove through their bodies. On the 8th of March the governor quitted the town, and &s;et fire to it; but notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of the militia, and &s;ome reinforcements which arrived from Surinam, they continued greatly &s;uperior to the planters and the whites, who were plentifully &s;up|plied with provi&s;ions of every kind. When the account of this in&s;urrection arrived at Barbadoes, the Engli&s;h governor of that i&s;land immediately or|dered all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be &s;ent to the Dutch planters that the &s;tate of his government could admit of, which put a &s;top to the progre&s;s of the rebels; &s;o that, when &s;upplies came from the European Dutch, they had very little more to do than to complete what the Engli&s;h had begun. But whether the colony it&s;elf has been &s;ince &s;ecured again&s;t in&s;urrections of the like nature, time only can determine. We are now to return to the hi&s;tory of Great Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bank of Eng|land re|news its charter. See vol. iv. p. 115.</NOTE> One of the principal objects of this &s;e&s;&s;ion of par|liament was the propo&s;al made by the Bank of England to the committee of the hou&s;e of com|mons for advancing the &s;um of one million on ex|chequer-bills, and for paying the &s;um of 1,100,000l&punc; into the exchequer. We have already explained the purpo&s;e for which the former of tho&s;e &s;ums was intended. The latter was meant as a pre&s;ent to the public for renewing the patent of the bank,
<PB N="336" REF="3460">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> which has been long &s;o beneficial to this kingdom, and &s;o profitable to the members of that important body. We are here to ob&s;erve, that, upon the original e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank of England, the proprietors obtained their charter upon the con&s;ideration of their lending the government 1,200,000 l. at an intere&s;t which amounted to above 8 per cent. But the public prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions ran then &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t banking, which might be abu&s;ed into a monopoly of money, that an act at the &s;ame time pa&s;&s;ed, by which it was expre&s;sly provided, "That at any time, upon twelve months notice, after the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t 1705, and upon repayment by parliament of the &s;aid &s;um of 1,200,000 l. and all arrears of the &s;aid yearly in|tere&s;t, the payment of the &s;aid yearly intere&s;t, and the &s;aid corporation, &s;hould ab&s;olutely cea&s;e and determine." In 1697, the term was continued to the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t 1710, upon their agreeing to lend another &s;um upon the like exorbitant intere&s;t; but the privileges were enlarged by a clau&s;e which provided, "That, during the continuance of this bank, no other bank &s;hould be either erected or permitted by parliament." Before the expiration of the term in 1710, the government found &s;o much benefit from the in&s;titution of this bank, that it was enacted, "That, after the 29th of September 1708, during the continuance of the bank of England, it &s;hall not be lawful for any body politic or corpo|rate (other than the &s;aid company of the bank) or for any partners exceeding &s;ix in England, to bor|row or owe any &s;um on bill or note, payable on de|mand&punc;

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the Bank.</NOTE> Whatever con&s;ideration the governors or other per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the bank might be&s;tow upon tho&s;e who procured them this great and indeed un|precedented exclu&s;ive privilege, it is certain, that upon the whole all that the public gained in re|turn was in point of conveniency. The whig mi|ni&s;ters found that they could more readily rai&s;e mo|ney by the bank than by any other method of fi|nancing; and therefore they carried through every mea&s;ure for its advantage, without &s;eeming once to reflect on the prodigious load of intere&s;t attending every one of tho&s;e convenient calls upon the bank. It was even remarked (though we are not in this place to de&s;cend to parti|culars) that after the Ea&s;t India company had agreed to accept of five per cent. for the in|tere&s;t of the debt due from the government, the bank in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;ix, without their being all the while at one &s;hilling of expence for the re|newal of their charter, though prolonged to the year 1732, and from thence to the year 1742. Thus (whatever may be pretended) the favours of the government, and the public money, have laid the foundation of the va&s;t credit of the bank of England; and the &s;ums which they gained by bank|ing under whig mini&s;ters are incredible. In the year 1742, when their term was to expire, the na|tion was engaged in a war with Spain; and the go|vernment having then occa&s;ion for money, the di|rectors of the bank agreed to advance the &s;um of 1,600,000l. before December 25, 1742, without

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> any intere&s;t to be paid for it after the fir&s;t of Au|gu&s;t, 1743, from which time they were to re&s;t &s;a|tisfied with their original annuity of 100,000l. up|on condition of their term being continued till the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1764: in pur&s;uance of which agree|ment, the act 15 Geo. II. ch. 23. was pa&s;&s;ed the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, by which their corporation and term of exclu&s;ive banking, with all former pri|vileges, was to continue till the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t 1764; after which, upon a year's notice, and pay|ment of the &s;aid 1,600,000l. now advanced, and the like &s;um before advanced, and all arrears of their &s;aid annuity of 100,000l. and the principal and intere&s;t owing them on all tallies, exchequer-orders, exche|quer bills, or parliamentary funds, (except &s;uch fund as were otherwi&s;e provided for) which the company &s;hould have remaining in their hands, or be inti|tled to, at the time of &s;uch notice given, then, and not till then, their corporation was to cea&s;e and determine.</P>
<P>All the favour the public received from the di|rectors, even at this period, was their agreeing to take le&s;s intere&s;t for the whole of their debt, amount|ing now to three millions, two hundred thou&s;and pounds, than was that year allowed for money ad|vanced on the land&punc;tax. It is well known, that when the great reduction of intere&s;t took place in 1749, the general court of the bank, with tho&s;e of the other two great companies, oppo&s;ed it, till they &s;aw that the parliament was likely to pay off the ca|pital &s;tock, if they &s;tood out; and then they agreed to it. By the new act the redemption-clau&s;e above|mentioned is repealed, and it is enacted, that the

He was received with proper honours by general Cornwallis the governor; and, after &s;pending two days in viewing that &s;tupendous fortre&s;s, he pro|ceeded to Minorca, where he arrived on the 11th of November, and had an opportunity of examining the fortifications of Fort St. Philip. As the Duke of York, by his education was perfectly well quali|fied to judge of the &s;tate of tho&s;e two bulwarks of the Briti&s;h empire in the Mediterranean, the public of England was highly plea&s;ed at his vi&s;iting them; and it has been &s;aid that &s;everal very u&s;eful works are now adding to Gibraltar, in con&s;equence of &s;ome ob&s;ervations made on the &s;pot by his royal highne&s;s. On the 17th of the &s;ame month he &s;ail|ed from Minorca, attended by the Lively and Thames frigates; and, after encountering &s;ome bad weather, he arrived at Genoa on the 28th at night.

could exceed either the politene&s;s or magnificence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> with which tho&s;e republicans received and enter|tained the royal &s;tranger. The Genoe&s;e ma&s;ter of the ceremonies came on board the Centurion, and acquainted his royal highne&s;s that the republic had ordered a palace to be fitted up for his u&s;e; but as the duke &s;till retained the character of earl of Ul&s;ter, he declined that and all the other honours intended him, excepting a deputation of &s;ix noble|men, who were appointed on the part of the &s;enate, to attend him during his re&s;idence at Genoa; their names were James Gentile, Bartholomew Lomel|lino, Nicolas Cattaneo, Jerome Durazzo, Jerome Venero&s;o, and Dominic Franzone. Mo&s;t of the Genoe&s;e nobility attended tho&s;e deputies in paying their re&s;pects to his royal highne&s;s. On the 30th of November he received a pre&s;ent, on the part of the republic, of all kinds of fruits, wines, wild fowl, and other refre&s;hments; and the Duke going on &s;hore in the evening, was entertained with a magnificent ball, and a &s;upper of forty co|vers, in the palace which had been prepared for his reception. Even the gloomy forms of their reli|gion were &s;et a&s;ide to do honour to his per&s;on and high rank; for, though it was advent time, when no theatrical diver&s;ions nor ma&s;king is allowed in that &s;tate, yet, after the ball, the palace doors were thrown open, and a great company of ma&s;kers were admitted, to te&s;tify their re&s;pects to his royal highne&s;s.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> their dre&s;&s;es and equipages; and nothing could be more &s;plendid than the diver&s;ions and entertain|ments exhibited during the remaining part of the month. His royal highne&s;s did not yield to the noble Genoe&s;e in politene&s;s. He invited the greate&s;t per&s;onages of their republic to an entertainment on the 10th of January, on board his &s;hip, and being &s;en&s;ible of the great &s;ums laid out in entertaining him, it is &s;aid that he made pre&s;ents during his re&s;idence at Genoa to the amount of near $0,000 ducats. On the 11th of February he left that magnificent city, one of the mo&s;t &s;hewy perhaps of any in the world, and &s;et out by land to vi&s;it his Sardinian maje&s;ty's domi|nions. No prince in Europe, the empre&s;s queen excepted, had been more beholden than his Sardinian maje&s;ty to the friend&s;hip of Great Britain, which has rendered him far more power|ful than any of his predece&s;&s;ors, and an impregna|ble bulwark to the ambition of France on the &s;ide of Italy. On the heights of Lonquette, the Duke's carriage happened to break down; and he proceed|ed on hor&s;eback to Alexandria, a city, which, thro' the good offices of England, had been ceded to the late king of Sardinian by the treaty of Utrecht. The high reputation in which the Briti&s;h royal fa|mily and name &s;tood in the pre&s;ent king's domi|nions broke through all re&s;traint, notwith&s;tand|ing the de&s;ire of his royal highne&s;s to continue in a private character. When he approached to Alex|andria he was met in the king of Sardinia's name by the commandant of the place with two coaches and &s;ix, which attended him to the governor's

He was there waited upon and magnificently entertained by the chief nobility and the officers of the garri|&s;on; and a captain's guard attended him. Af|ter vi&s;iting the citadel, which is a complete piece of military architecture, he received at his depar|ture the &s;ame honours as at his arrival; and pro|ceeding to A&s;ti, the next fortified town, he was there treated in the &s;ame re&s;pectful manner.</P>
<P>When he arrived within ten miles of Turin he was met by his Sardinian maje&s;ty's ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, and his deputy, with the royal equi|pages, which conducted him to a palace prepared for his reception, where he received the compli|ments of the king and royal family of Sardinia, and tho&s;e of all the foreign mini&s;ters, who waited upon his royal highne&s;s in a body. After this he was carried to court in the &s;ame equipages, attend|ed by the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, Mr. Pi$t, the Briti&s;h envoy at Turin, &s;ir William Boothby, and colonel St. John. His reception and entertain|ment by his Sardinian maje&s;ty d$ffered in no re|&s;pect from what it would have been had he appear|ed as duke of York. At the bottom of a private &s;tair-ca&s;e he was met by the &s;ame lord of the bed|chamber, who had complimented him in the name of the king, and was conducted from the head of the &s;tairs by the grand chamberlain, to the royal pre&s;ence: his maje&s;ty, on this occa&s;ion, was attended by the duke of Chablais, his elde&s;t &s;on by his &s;econd marriage, and the prince of Piedmont, eld|e&s;t

<P>All this &s;tate and magnificence did not exclude the warme&s;t te&s;timonies of e&s;teem and cordiality in the interviews his royal highne&s;s had with his Sar|dinian maje&s;ty and the royal family, who&s;e heart the duke won by the politene&s;s, ea&s;e, and &s;incerity of his behaviour. He &s;eemed as if he had been born and educated in the Sardinian court; and when the fir&s;t ceremonies were over, he was waited upon by the prince of Carignan and his &s;on, the great officers of &s;tate, the knights of the order of the Annunciation, and by all per&s;ons of di&s;tinction about court. On the 15th of February, count Albeni de Belgios came from Milan to Turin on the part of the duke of Modena, who, by order of the empre&s;s queen, offered his royal highne&s;s the ducal palace at Milan when he &s;hould vi&s;it that city. The vi&s;its of &s;tate and public entertainments being over, his royal highne&s;s in&s;pected the citadel and the other fortifications about Turin; and then received, by the marquis Calcagnini, the duke of Parma's compliments, with an invita|tion to &s;pend &s;ome time at his court. During the re&s;idence of his royal highne&s;s at Turin, he gave &s;everal magnificent entertainments to the

On the 6th of March he took leave of the court of Turin, who &s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ibly affected at his departure. His royal highne&s;s then &s;et out for Milan, where he was received and treated with all the honours due to his rank; but when he came to Parma, he only &s;topt till he could change hor&s;es; and he received the compliments from the duke by Mr. Tillot at his coach-door. On the 16th he arrived at Flo|rence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Florence&punc;</NOTE> and took up his re&s;idence at the hou&s;e of Sir Horace Mann, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter there. Tho' he declared that he would be known under no other character than that of earl of Ul&s;ter, yet the &s;treets through which he pa&s;&s;ed was crowded with &s;pectators, and a guard attended him; but his royal highne&s;s politely di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it.

Next day he took a $our about the town in his coach, called upon mar&s;hal Botta, ad|mitted all the Engli&s;h to dine with him; and the day following he received the members of the re|gency, and the foreign mini&s;ters. Hearing that mar&s;hal Botta de lined, out of re&s;pect, to invite him to dinner, his royal highne&s;s &s;ent him word that he would d$ne with him on the 19th; and the evening concluded with a gr$nd a&s;&s;embly opened

He was received under a di&s;charge of the artillery, and cho&s;e to alight at an inn, tho' the magi&s;trates had provided a hou&s;e for the u&s;e of their illu&s;trious vi&s;itor. The &s;ame deputies waited upon him at his inn, to de&s;ire his acceptance of a pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ting of eighteen che&s;ts of oil, wine, coffee, chocolate, wax, &s;weetmeats, hams, and va|rious other refre&s;hments. This pre&s;ent was u&s;hered in by a maitre d'h&ocirc;tel, (whom his royal highne&s;s generou&s;ly rewarded) and carried by fifty &s;ervants in the livery of the republic. The Duke then was conducted in coaches of the republic to the palace, which was magnificently furni&s;hed, and had been prepared for his lodging, where he met with a &s;plendid entertainment, of which many ladies partook. A ball followed, with a concert of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic; nor did the company break up till three in the morning. His royal highne&s;s then &s;et out on his return to Florence; and in pa&s;&s;ing Pi&s;toia, he was &s;aluted by the cannon, complimented by the governor of the place; and after lying at one of the emperor's hunting &s;eats, returned in the evening to Florence, where he partook of the u&s;ual diver&s;ions. On the 11th of April, mar&s;hal Botta and the regency waited upon the Duke to wi&s;h him a good journey; and he &s;et out, attended by Sir Horace Mann, for Sienna.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rome.</NOTE> Hitherto the public of Great Britain were great|ly divided in opinion, whether a Briti&s;h prince would vi&s;it the capital of Italy, which was the re&s;i|dence of a per&s;on who bears his illu&s;trious titl$, and of the pretender to his brother's crown and dominions. But the amiable qualities of his Bri|tannic maje&s;ty and his illu&s;trious family, had di&s;|armed even prejudice and bigotry; and it was in|&s;inuated that, rather than his royal highne&s;s &s;hould be put to the &s;malle&s;t inconveniency, the excepti|onable per&s;onages would leave the city during his re&s;idence in it. The Duke having left Sienna on the 13th of April, pa&s;&s;ed through Bon Conven$$, San Quericio, Radicofino, the la&s;t place in the F$e|rentine dominions, Aquapendente, the fir&s;t in the pope's territory, Bol&s;ona, Montefia&s;conci, famous for its wines, Viterbo, where he lodged, Monto Ro&s;a, Varca, and Veii, the rival of antient Rome; and on the 14th he arrived at that capital. It happened that his royal highne&s;s had &s;ome knowledge of certain noblemen there of high qua|lity, who had vi&s;ited England; and his ho$ine&s;s
<PB N="355" REF="3630">
had the politene&s;s to &s;end the grand prior Cor&s;ini,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and one of the Borghe&s;e family, both of whom had been in England, to compliment him in the name of the eccle&s;ia$tical &s;tate, and to offer their &s;ervices during his re&s;idence at Rome. Had his holine&s;s been at the head of the prote&s;tant reli|gion, he could not have treated his royal highne&s;s with greater marks of e&s;teem, regard, and benevo|lence, than he expre&s;s'd. The two princes, already mentioned, attended him through all the labyrinths of ruin and magnificence. Princes, cardinals, and noblemen vied with each other in doing him honour; and the elegant magnificence of this once mi&s;tre&s;s of the world &s;eemed to be revived in the enter|tainments of every kind that were made for his royal highne&s;s. His holine&s;s made him a pre&s;ent of &s;ome che&s;ts of rich wine, be&s;ides &s;ome valuable curio&s;i|ties&punc; and every thing that was rare waited upon the illu&s;trious &s;trange$ from princes and noblemen, for his acceptance. Before the duke left Rome, the pope ordered a hor&s;e-race, after the Roman manner, to be performed by barbs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a de&s;cription of this kind of hor&s;e-racing, &s;ee Con|damme's Trav$ls.</NOTE>.

It is &s;aid that the Duke, on taking leave of his two princely conductors, made them a noble pre&s;ent of Saxon porcelane.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> His royal highne&s;s returned to Florence from Rome, and from thence &s;et out for Bologna, where he arrived on the 5th of May. Having &s;een what|ever was worthy of curio&s;ity in that once famous &s;eminary of learning, and every where attended by the u&s;ual honours due to his rank, he &s;et out for Parma, where he alighted at the hotel Palavicini, and was complimented again by Mr. Tillot, who immediately introduced him to his ma&s;ter. The duke of Parma is, in his behav$our, a remarkable exception to the pride and formality for which the Spani&s;h branches of the families of Au&s;tria and Bourbon have been generally noted. As he was an early adventurer for &s;overeignty, he entered upon life with few prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and his &s;ubjects have experienced under him that happine&s;s which re&s;ults from the good &s;en&s;e of a &s;overeign, who places his greatne&s;s in the welfare of his people. He received the duke of York with the &s;ame ea&s;e and frankne&s;s with which he would have receiv'd his brother; and &s;ome Engli&s;h noblemen of great di&s;|tinction<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa$ma.</NOTE> being then at the court of Parma, all their parties and entertainments were agreeably heighten|ed, e&s;pecially as the duke of Parma him&s;elf is no &s;mall proficient in the Engli&s;h language. The illu&s;|trious &s;tranger vi&s;ited all the branches of the royal hou&s;e of Spain then at Parma; often dined and lived in a kind of intimacy with the court; partook of all the diver&s;ions of the field and the theatre, where the actors carried their complai&s;ance &s;o far to his royal highne&s;s, that in one of their operas, they introduced &s;ome complimentary lines upon his per|&s;on. After hunting in the park of Colorno, and

partaking of a va&s;t variety of mu&s;ical, ma&s;king, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> other, exhibitions, the whole concluded with a mag|nificent ma&s;querade ball at the theatre; at which the duke of Parma and all the royal family a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>His royal highne&s;s proceeded from Parma to Mantua, where he was entertained with proper<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mantua.</NOTE> honours; and on the 2$th of May he was received on the frontiers of the Venetian &s;tate, by detach|ments of light Dalmatian hor&s;$, who e&s;corted him to Verona. Here a magnificent bull-fea&s;t had been prepared for his entertainment, to be exhibited in the old amphitheatre, which is perhaps the com|plete&s;t Roman antiquity in the world, of that kind. His royal highne&s;s's &s;cheme of travelling prevent|ed this mark of re&s;pect being &s;hewn to him; and, after receiving at his inn the compliments of M. Cornaro, the pote&s;ta, he proceeded to Vi$enza, where he alighted from his coach to &s;ee the Olympic theatre; and proceeding to Padua, was there com|plimented by the proveditor and the chief nobility. On the 26th at night, he arrived at Venice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Venice.</NOTE> The government of that ancient, and once powerful Republic, have for &s;ome years courted the protection, and cultivated the friend&s;hip of England.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> the great pomp with which their amba&s;&s;a|dors appeared at London. The truth is, the friend|&s;hip of England has &s;ecured to that republic the re&s;pect of her inveterate enemies the Turks, and of all the Barbary &s;tates; and &s;he has, for above thirty years pa&s;t, remained in a &s;tate of tranquil pro&s;perity. Four deputies of the fir&s;t quality were appointed by the doge to attend his royal highne&s;s during his re&s;idence at Venice; magnifi|cent boxes were fitted up in the opera-hou&s;e for his reception there; and a very fine felucca was built to carry him through the different quarters of the city. He was attended by other feluccas, filled with the Engli&s;h nobility and gentry, who happen|ed to be then at Venice, and by noble Venetians, all of them rowed by boat-men in Engli&s;h dre&s;&s;es. He vi&s;ited the ar&s;enal, (and while he was there, they began to build a large galley,) the rope-walks, the armoury, and it is &s;aid &s;aw 3000 hands em|ployed in &s;hip-building. Concerts of mu&s;ic attend|ed him, and feats of activity, peculiar to the coun|try, were every where exhibited for his amu&s;ement. On the 30th, he received from the magi&s;trates of Razon Vecchia, the u&s;ual pre&s;ents made to foreign princes, con&s;i&s;ting of a large &s;ervice of gla&s;s for a de&s;ert, and of wax in a variety of forms of birds, fruits, and flowers, to which was added a bureau of very extraordinary workman&s;hip.

<P>The&s;e were but preludes to the magnificent ex|hibitions upon the great canal on the 4th of June, his Britannic maje&s;ty's birth-day. The zeal of the deputies was not to be damped by the &s;hortne&s;s of time allotted for the preparations of this glorious &s;pectacle, which the Venetians call a public regatta. It is introduced by a race in &s;ingle boats of a four mile cour&s;e, terminating in a con&s;picuous &s;truc|ture, erected on barges repre&s;enting the palace of Joy; and in the front of the fir&s;t &s;tory was repre|&s;ented Venice embracing Britain.

After the fir&s;t race was over, his royal highne&s;s went a&s;hore to a palace, where a noble collation was prepared for him; and from its balcony he &s;aw the remaining diver&s;ions, the mo&s;t &s;plendid perhaps of the kind of any exhibited &s;ince the days of antient Rome. The peotas were emblematical pageants repre&s;ent|ing the four elements, Great Britain, the Whale Fi&s;hery, the Triumphs of Pallas and Venus, and the Chariot of the Sun; all rivalling each other in pomp, and glittering with &s;ilver and gold, particu|larly

If the Engli&s;h at this time &s;uffered a real grievance, it aro&s;e from the marriage act; the ob&s;ervance of which was now found to be intolerable and impracti|cable.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Iwan, by the empre&s;s Catharine II. had been re|moved from the u&s;ual place of his confinement to the ca&s;ile of Schlu&s;&s;elburg, at the time when &s;he was preparing to &s;et out on a progre&s;s to Mittau, the capital of Courland, with an intention, as was reported, to be pre&s;ent incognito at the election of Poniatow&s;ki, king of Poland, an incident which was thought to be very intere&s;ting to her. While &s;he was at Mittau, an account arrived of the young prince's death in the following manner. A lieute|nant, one Mirowitz, belonging to the regiment of Smolen&s;ko, de&s;ired, out of his turn, that he might be admitted to do duty in the ca&s;tle of Schlu&s;&s;el|burg; which was granted him. About two in the morning, on the 15th of Augu&s;t, Mirowitz, all of a &s;udden, called up the main guard, formed it into a line, and ordered the &s;oldiers to load with ball. Berenikoff, who was governor of the fortre&s;s, of|fering to interpo&s;e, Mirowitz pre&s;ented to him a forged order from the empre&s;s, importing, that her maje&s;ty had formed the re&s;olution of re&s;igning the imperial crown of Ru&s;&s;ia, and of putting it on the head of prince Iwan, whom in con&s;cience &s;he was obliged to acknowledge as the lawful heir and &s;o|vereign of Ru&s;&s;ia; and that &s;he therefore com|manded the governor to &s;et the prince at liberty.</P>
<P>Iwan, when he was committed to the ca&s;tle of Schlu&s;&s;elburg, had been put under the care of two officers, captain Wla&s;&s;eiff and lieutenant Tchekin, who appear to have been veterans in the trade of murder, and to have had under them a guard ap|propriated to the cu&s;tody of Iwan's per&s;on. Their orders were never to &s;uffer him to depart alive out

out of his confinement, however plau&s;ible the pre|text<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> might be. The governor, upon Mirowitz producing his forged order, di&s;puted its authenti|city; upon which the other knocked him down with the butt end of his mu&s;ket. The guard was attack|ed by Mirowitz, but he was repul&s;ed; upon which he ordered a piece of cannon to be brought from the ba&s;tions, and planted again&s;t his opponents. The two keepers, pretending that they could not an&s;wer for the con&s;equences, ru&s;hed into the apart|ment of the unfortunate prince, who &s;eems to have been entirely ignorant of the attempt, and mur|dered him in his bed in the mo&s;t inhuman manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirowitz con|demned and be|headed.</NOTE> To convince Mirowitz of $wan's death, they ex|po&s;ed his body at the window, which &s;truck Miro|witz with &s;uch di&s;may, that he in&s;tantly abandoned his purpo&s;e, and &s;urrendered him&s;elf a pri&s;oner in|to the hands of the governor and the two officers. This extraordinary in&s;tance of moderation was at|tended with &s;uitable effects. The &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on, who, very po&s;&s;ibly imagined, that the order Mirowitz produced was authentic, &s;ubmitted like|wi&s;e to their governor, who &s;ent to Panin, one of the Ru&s;&s;ian coun&s;ellors, a relation of the attempt and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, which was communicated to the em|pre&s;s. She immediately ordered general Weymarn to take the nece&s;&s;ary informations on the &s;pot, in which there was no great difficulty, as Mirowitz freely confe&s;&s;ed all he was charged with. She then referred the whole affair to the con&s;ideration of her &s;enate; and to make the proceeding the more &s;olemn, &s;he ordered them to invite to their a&s;&s;i&s;|tance the &s;ynod of the clergy, the three fir&s;t cla&s;&s;es,

It is &s;aid, that Mirowitz &s;ub|mitted to the block with great con&s;tancy and re|&s;ignation. The court of Peter&s;burgh &s;oon after publi&s;hed a relation, by authority, of the whole affair; but it was far from being &s;atisfactory to the public.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficul|ties in the election of a king of the Romans.</NOTE> The empire of Germany was at the &s;ame time intent upon an affair of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the rights of the princes who required a participa|tion in the election of a king of the Romans. Ever &s;ince the days of the emperor Charles V. a di&s;pute had &s;ub&s;i$$ed, whether, agreeably to the con&s;titution of the empire, a king of the Romans could be elected during the life of the reigning emperor. The point was partly &s;ettled by the treaty of We&s;tphalia; it was afterwards unanimou&s;ly agreed to in a general diet of the empire; and its contents fir&s;t took place in the capitulation of the election of Charles VI. and was, on the vacancy of the Imperial throne, repeated in the following capitulations of election: It mentions three ca&s;es, which legitimate the election of a king of the Ro|mans during the emperor's life.

This important affair was again re&s;umed by the court of Vienna; but tho' it met with no oppo&s;i|tion from the electors, it was not without its dif|ficulties. The archbi&s;hop of Mentz had convoked an electoral a&s;&s;embly to take the affair into con&s;i|deration; and the mini&s;ter of the bi&s;hop of Saltz|burgh pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the Imperial mini&s;ters at the diet at Rati&s;bon, concerning the rights of the college of princes. The an&s;wer re|turned was as follows: That his imperial maje&s;ty was then employed in finding out an expedient for the content and con&s;olation of the princes of the empire, relating to the election of a king of the Romans, without prejudice to the electoral col|lege; and con&s;equently of &s;uch a nature as to avoid all di&s;putes between them. This an&s;wer was far from being agreeable to many of the princes; but in March following they received an Imperial re|&s;cript from the electoral emba&s;&s;adors at Franck|fort, of their having come to a re&s;olution to pro|ceed to the election of a king of the Romans, on the third of that month. Upon this, the majority of the college, rather than give any farther oppo|&s;ition to &s;o &s;alutary a mea&s;ure, pre&s;ented their a&s;|&s;ent to the chief Imperial commi&s;&s;ary; and the arch|duke Jo&s;eph was accordingly cho&s;en and crowned with great &s;olemnity, at Franckfort on the third of April.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> was owing to a terrible famine which pre|vailed in Italy, and reduced the inhabitants to great di&s;tre&s;s. His Catholic maje&s;ty, in pity to his former &s;ubjects, exerted him&s;elf wonderfully in their behalf, by &s;upplying them from Spain with wheat, flour, and bi&s;ket.

Large commi&s;&s;ions for buying up corn were &s;ent all over Europe, e&s;pecially to England; and it was thought that no le&s;s than 30,000 tons were imported into the kingdom of Naples alone.

The numbers buried in churches threatened an immediate pe&s;tilence, and tho&s;e in|humations were prohibited. The general voice was, that the infection had ari&s;en, or rather had been encrea&s;ed, through the noxious quality of the corn which had been imported; and it is &s;aid, that this opinion was confirmed by the phy&s;icians, who had examined the corn it&s;elf; but, perhaps, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion operated &s;trongly upon the judgment both of the phy&s;icians and the public.

The magi&s;trates of Naples were obliged to give way to it, by impri&s;oning their corn merchants. The calamity &s;pread to Sicily, once the granary of Europe; and the Syracu&s;ans, in a tumult, reduced the hou&s;e of one of their principal magi&s;trates to a&s;hes, him&s;elf and family narrowly e&s;caping with their lives. The violence of the di&s;temper fir&s;t abated in Naples and the great towns of that kingdom; and in the capital, about the middle of July, not above 100 per&s;ons buried in a day; but at la&s;t the infection gradually wore off.</P>

Tho' theywere not con&s;iderable enough to place one of their own princes upon the throne, yet they found means to di&s;&s;uade &s;everal of the Palatines from entering into any formal a&s;&s;ociation for chu&s;|ing a Pia&s;t; and thus in fact, they formed a third party, but appeared more inclinable to favour Radzivil than Poniatow&s;ki.

The empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia publi&s;hed manife&s;toes, de|claring, that her &s;ole intention in ordering her troops to march into Poland was to pre&s;erve the freedom of the election; that they had orders to behave in the mo&s;t regular and inoffen&s;ive man|ner, and to pay for every thing they had in the country. All tho&s;e precautions re&s;tored the public to &s;uch tranquility, that on the 7th of May the diet was opened without any mi&s;chief, and the mar|&s;hal's &s;taff put into the hands of prince Adam Czartorin&s;ki, cou&s;in german to count Poniatow&s;ki, the Ru&s;&s;ian troops being drawn up in &s;uch a man|ner as to &s;ecure the freedom of the election with|out over-awing the electors.

that were infringements of the liberties of Poland<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and the election. Twenty-two &s;enators and forty-five nuncios &s;igned this prote&s;t or manife&s;to, which was entirely di&s;regarded by the diet. As the Ru&s;&s;ian troops in fact had behaved in the mo&s;t inoffen|&s;ive manner, the diet declared count Branitzki to be dive&s;ted of his po&s;t of general of the crown ar|my. He denied that the members had any pow|er to take &s;uch a &s;tep, and he ordered his troops to rendezvou&s;e near Lublin. The diet having in|telligence of his intention, and that the count was daily &s;trengthening his army with new levies, or|dered a part of their own troops and a detachment of Ru&s;&s;ians to march after them, and to ob&s;erve his motions.</P>
<P>The diet, in the mean time, proceeded to di&s;|patch the bu&s;ine&s;s previous to the election; and &s;uch was the zeal of its members again&s;t the pro|te&s;tants, that they re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, `That the con&s;titutions made again&s;t the prote&s;tants in 1717, 1733, and 1736, &s;hould be put in execution: that no prote&s;tants &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s any thing whatever, except what may belong to them by hereditary right: and that all prote&s;tants may be legally pro|&s;ecuted, who &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s any thing contrary to the law.' This violence again&s;t the prote&s;tants was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Severities again&s;t the pro|te&s;tants&punc;</NOTE> equally unju&s;t and impolitic on the part of the di|et, and added greatly to the &s;trength of Branitz|ki's party. The con&s;titution of Poland is &s;uch, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the Poles to main|tain it without the intervention of a foreign force. Had it not been for the Ru&s;&s;ian troops, it is proba|ble that Branitzki and Radzivil might have &s;tood

Branitzki retired towards Hungary, and the wi&s;e mea&s;ures taken by the primate prevailed on many of the of|ficers of the crown troops to return to their duty under prince Czartorin&s;ki, grand regimentary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The in|&s;urgents defeated.</NOTE> Branitzki being thus driven to a &s;tate of de&s;pair, centered all his hopes now in being &s;upported by the Turks, in the efforts made by prince Rad|zivil in the field, and in tho&s;e of the Imperial and French amba&s;&s;adors in the diet. The Turks, how|ever, made no motions in his favour, and the Ru&s;&s;ians, with the troops of the diet under prince Dolgorouki, kept Radzivil in &s;uch awe, that he retired towards Slonim, a little town in Lithuania. There the Ru&s;|&s;ians overtook the prince, and a &s;mart engagement en&s;ued, in which it is &s;aid the young and beautiful prince&s;s Radzivil &s;ignalized her&s;elf in the foremo&s;t ranks, fighting by her hu&s;band's &s;ide with her &s;abre; and tho' their party was obliged to retire, yet they did it in good order, and the prince&s;s was received according to her rank and quality at Bre&s;lau, tho' it was publickly known his Pru&s;|&s;ian maje&s;ty was far from approving of the party which her hu&s;band had embraced.</P>

The marquis de Paulmy d'Argen&s;on, the French amba&s;&s;ador, &s;eized hold of the ab&s;ence of the few members who had embraced their party, to di&s;pute the legality of the diet, and he received in&s;tructions from France ac|cordingly. In an abrupt manner he demanded au|dience of the primate, to which he was admitted, and both continued &s;tanding, the primate having received an intimation of his intention. The em|ba&s;&s;ador produced his di&s;patches, by which he was ordered to return to France, and to ab&s;ent him&s;elf during the inter-regnum, as his ma&s;ter did not think it proper he &s;hould re&s;ide there with a party, and not with the republic at large, to which alone he had been &s;ent. This &s;peech was, in fact, a di&s;avowal of the diet's authority, and had been pronounced in pre&s;ence of many of its members, whom his high|ne&s;s had de&s;ired to attend him on the occa&s;ion. The primate an&s;wered with great dignity, that he was &s;orry the amba&s;&s;ador's orders were of &s;uch a nature, as to prevent his treating him with the re|&s;pect due to his public character; but that he and the French re&s;ident, Mon&s;. Hemin, were at li|berty to leave Poland when they plea&s;ed. Upon &s;ome farther conference the primate treated the am|ba&s;&s;ador only as Mon&s;. de Paulmy, and the amba&s;&s;a|dor addre&s;&s;ed the primate only as archbi&s;hop. This interview, and the little ceremony with which it was carried on, was a proof what &s;mall influence the French mini&s;try had now in a nation, where their amba&s;&s;adors, in former times, u&s;ed to give law,
<PB N="392" REF="4000">

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the Poli&s;h male-contents found refuge and protection in the Turki&s;h domi|nions, where the Imperial and French mini&s;ters had been very a&s;&s;iduous in repre&s;enting the elec|tion at War&s;aw in a light very unfavourable to the intere&s;ts of the Turki&s;h empire. The Poles now applied them&s;elves with great a&s;&s;iduity to the affairs of the diet, tho' the imperial amba&s;|&s;ador had likewi&s;e withdrawn him&s;elf from War|&s;aw. On the 3d of September the diet con&s;ulted upon the PACTA CONVENTA, or Fundamental Compact, which they were to require their future king to ratify. Such is the attachment of the Poles to their antient u&s;ages, that, during the debate, even points of dre&s;s became &s;erious matters. All difficulties being at la&s;t &s;urmounted, the Ru&s;&s;ian and Pru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ters recommended, in form, count Stani&s;laus Poniatow&s;ki as a proper per&s;on to fill up the throne of Poland. The election &s;ermon was<NOTE PLACE="marg">ponia|tow&s;ki e|lected king of Poland.</NOTE> preached by a bi&s;hop, and on the 7th of Septem|ber he was cho&s;en king, by the name and title of Stani&s;laus Augu&s;tus king of Poland, and grand duke of Lithuania. Perhaps the election of no prince was ever made upon more con&s;titutional principles, as nothing was omitted in the Pacta Conventa that could bring back the government of Poland to its fir&s;t principles, or to guard again&s;t the crown, from being elective, becoming heredi|tary. The diet of election, tho' it la&s;ted twelve days, and con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix hundred nuncios, all at|tended with numerous retinues, pa&s;&s;ed without the

The letter of congratulation, written by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, is a ma&s;ter-piece of the kind; and its compo&s;ition would do the greate&s;t honour to that monarch's genius, was it not conceived in a &s;tile more proper for a pupil than an equal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Your maje&s;ty mu&s;t re|flect that as you enjoy a crown by election, and not by de|&s;cent, the world will be more ob&s;ervant of your maje&s;ty's actions than of any other potentate in Europe; and it is but rea&s;onable.

As that prince was yet in his cradle, the elector of Co|logne, being metropolitan of O&s;naburg, controverted the preten&s;ions of the chapter of that bi&s;hopric to the admini&s;tration of &s;piritual affairs during the mi|nority of the prince bi&s;hop, and nominated to ex|erci&s;e the &s;aid admini&s;tration on his part, the ho|norary bi&s;hop of Ahau&s;en, with the title of pontifi|cal vicar, and the dean and canon Charles de Voge|lius, with that of vicar general; ordering all the inhabitants and &s;ubjects of the bi&s;hopric to ac|knowledge them as &s;uch, upon pain of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure. This claim of the elector was en|tered rather for the form of pre&s;erving his privi|lege as metropolitan, than from any hopes of its &s;ucceeding; but a more &s;erious di&s;pute &s;ucceeded between the chapter of O&s;naburg and his Britannie maje&s;ty, who, as father and guardian to the prince bi&s;hop, claimed the temporal admini&s;tration and<NOTE PLACE="marg">di&s;putes thereon.</NOTE> pre&s;entation of the comitial &s;uffrage in the diet of the empire. The Hanoverian mini&s;try publi&s;hed a &s;trong memorial on this &s;ubject, in which they brought various precedents to e&s;tabli&s;h the right of

admini&s;tration in his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. The chap|ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> of O&s;naburg di&s;tributed to the members of the diet at Rati&s;bon, before whom the di&s;putes were now brought, a reply to this memorial, tending to prove, that the regency of O&s;naburg belongs to the chap|ter during the minority of the bi&s;hop, and likewi&s;e during the vacancy of the &s;ee. They pretended that in former times, the emperor, as the head of the Germanic body, had a right to provide again&s;t &s;uch minority; and that &s;ince his right was extin|gui&s;hed, the &s;ame authority had devolved upon the pope, through whom the chapter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it from cu&s;tom, their own privilege, and the perpetual ca|pitulation, from which it has not derogated, except|ing that the perpetual capitulation has a&s;&s;ured to the minor bi&s;hop a pen&s;ion of 8000 crowns, and the right of retaining near the regency two of his offi|cers, in quality of coun&s;ellors. The chapter then proceeded to de&s;troy the parity alledged by the Hanoverian memorial to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the pre|&s;ent and former minorities and vacancies; and to &s;hew that they were &s;ettled under the mediation of the emperor.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute, which in the two former reigns would have become a parliamentary con&s;ideration in England, was in this confined entirely to Ger|many.

The num|ber of cutters and other ve&s;&s;els that had been fitted out for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of this pernicious practice had been attended with excellent effects, not only from the va&s;t number of &s;eizures they made, but as being &s;o many provi&s;ions for de&s;erving &s;ea-offi|cers upon half pay, and providing and keeping up a body of &s;eamen for the u&s;e of the government; but they were not &s;ufficient for the extinction of the evil.

So far back as the &s;eventh and eighth years of the reign of king George I. acts of parliament had been made for preventing &s;uch illegal and de&s;tructive practices; but they were ineffectual for that pur|po&s;e.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An en|quiry in|to the cau&s;e of the high price of provi&s;i|ons.</NOTE> The public outery at the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions in a time of profound peace and after plentiful harve&s;ts was &s;o great, that the remedy became a parlia|mentary con&s;ideration. Some of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable butchers and victuallers of &s;hips in and about London were ordered to attend a commit|tee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who &s;at upon this occa&s;ion in March; and they unanimou&s;ly agreed, that the be&s;t beef at that time co&s;t the vender three pence a pound, which was about one half-penny dearer than it had generally been at that time of the year. This prodigious ri&s;e brought on other enquiries, which terminated much to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e; and it was found that the price of burcher's meat was dearer than it had been during the heat of the late war; but the event of all the enquiries ended in fixing the cau&s;es upon the &s;ale&s;men; upon which they were &s;ent for and examined. At fir&s;t, they laid the cau&s;e upon the va&s;t increa&s;e of population within the bills of mortality, which had rendered the demand of provi&s;ion exce&s;&s;ive. This account not being &s;atisfactory, they pretended that the ri&s;e was owing to the late &s;carcity of pork in the markets, which had nece&s;&s;arily encrea&s;ed the price of every other &s;pecies of animal food; be|cau&s;e the whole demand acted upon the whole quantity of the different &s;orts of provi&s;ions, as up|on one and the &s;ame &s;ubject. They complained that the wetne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;carcity of fodder in the year 1762, with other natural cau&s;es, had reduced the quantity of fat cattle, by di&s;cou|raging the farmers from rearing them.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="4130">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> None of tho&s;e rea&s;ons, however, were found &s;ufficient to account for the evil complained of; and the re&s;ult of the inquiry was, that the &s;carcity was artificial, and rai&s;ed by combinations, and the defect of the laws regulating the &s;ale of cattle in the open markets. This practice, tho' endea|voured to be &s;tifled and concealed from the know|ledge of the public, was an alarming con&s;ideration. It was proved that a few engro&s;$ers of cattle, either by them&s;elves or other age$ts, bought up large quantities of &s;heep and oxen on the road to the market, and thereby fixed the price for that day, while other per&s;ons bought up great numbers of &s;heep and oxen; and after they were &s;laughtered put what price they plea&s;ed upon them to the retail butchers; and that provi&s;ions were thus doubly fore&s;talled. It was evident that tho&s;e practices were confined to the London markets, becau&s;e during the greate&s;t &s;carcity of provi&s;ions in Lon|don, they &s;old at a very rea&s;onable price within thirty miles of that metropolis. Notwith&s;tanding the great attention paid by the parliament to this important affair, yet the remedy of it was &s;till pre|carious; and a bill pa&s;&s;ed for enabling his maje&s;ty, with the advice of his privy council, to order the free importation of provi&s;ions from Ireland during the rece&s;s of parliament, or, as the nece&s;&s;ity of the time may require.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iri&s;h im|portation of provi|&s;ions al|lowed.</NOTE> In October following the merchants of London petitioned his maje&s;ty concerning the high price of provi&s;ions: upon which a council was immediately called, and their evidence being there examined, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for permitting the free im|portation

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> It was unan&s;werably proved that the common<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ a|gain&s;t the $word$ an&s;wered.</NOTE> law of England could object to no tax impo&s;ed by the Briti&s;h parliament. With regard to char|ters or grants of the crown, that of Pen&s;ylvania (which has been always thought to be extremely favourable to the coloni&s;ts) expre&s;sly re&s;erved to parliament the power of taxing them; and the le|gi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies of Connecticut, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, New Hamp&s;hire, and Rhode I&s;land, are tied up from pa&s;&s;ing any acts that are repugnant, or not confermable, to the laws of Great Britain. The people of Maryland are the only Briti&s;h pro|vincials in America, who&s;e charter declares, "That the inhabitants &s;hall not be &s;ubject to any impo&s;i|tions or taxes, but &s;uch as their hou&s;e of burge&s;&s;es &s;hall con&s;ent to." But they were almo&s;t the only people in America who did not pretend to be ex|empted from parl amentary taxation. This acquie&s;|cence proceeded from a rational conviction, that the exemption expre&s;&s;ed in their charter, tho' it limited the power of the prerogative, could not limit that of the parliament, which has exerci&s;ed acts of legi&s;lature, over-ruling even the common law of England, in America. This was proved by an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in 1733, which abrogates &s;o much of the common law as relates to the de|&s;cents of freeholds in America, takes from the &s;on the right of inheritance in the lands the crown had granted to the father and his heirs in ab&s;olute fee, makes them a&s;&s;ets, and applies them to the payment of debts and accounts contracted by the father, without the participation of the &s;on.

<P>Were any farther proof of the parliament's power over the colonies wanting, the mutiny and de&s;ertion bill, which renders the troops rai&s;ed in America &s;ubject to the &s;ame pains and penalties as the Briti&s;h, might be in&s;tanced; as the American troops never were liable to tho&s;e puni&s;hments be|fore the fir&s;t year of the late war.</P>
<P>The rea&s;oning drawn again&s;t the American taxa|tions, becau&s;e the inhabitants are not repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament, is equally ab&s;urd and dan|gerous, as it is certain that &s;ixteen out of twenty parts of the people of Great Britain are not re|pre&s;ented in parliament. Manche&s;ter, Sheffield, Birmingham, with many other opulent and popu|lous places in England, might urge the &s;ame plea with much better grace. As to the impracticabi|lity or inconveniency of the Briti&s;h parliament taxing the American colonies, the latter argument was admitted; but as there was an indi&s;pen&s;able ne|ce&s;&s;ity for the taxation, the impo&s;ing it by par|liament was the only method that could an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, &s;ince the colonies could never agree a|mong them&s;elves about their &s;everal proportions of the duty, and the prerogative could not warrant the crown in in&s;i&s;ting upon any &s;pecifical &s;um from each province.</P>

They owed to the merchants of London four millions &s;terling, and the latter were &s;o ready and willing to give them farther credit, that &s;ome of the American legi&s;latures (as appears by the tax, a|mounting almo&s;t to a prohibition, we have already mentioned impo&s;ed upon the importation of ne|groes into South Carolina) pa&s;&s;ed acts again&s;t incur|ring &s;uch credit for the future. This unbounded confidence of the Briti&s;h merchants, aro&s;e from their knowing that no provincial legi&s;lature had a power to bar them from recovering their property, even in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of America, and that no frau|dulent inve&s;titure could evade the ju&s;tice of the Engli&s;h laws.

The cheva|lier's $word$ broke forth in the mo&s;t extraor|dinary publication which ever appeared, that of all the $word$ both per&s;onal and political, concern|ing the negotiation between the courts of England and France; and this was done with &s;o little re|&s;erve, that he hurt his friends as well as his ene|mies. It mu&s;t be owned, that the chevalier, by this publication, exhibited both the court and fi|nances of France in a mo&s;t de&s;picable light; and his undoubtedly contributed to the re&s;entment of that court. The count de Guerchy had &s;trong rea&s;ons, which we &s;hall not here particularize, for pro&s;ecuting the chevalier with &s;everity, and he brought again&s;t him an information in the court of King's Bench for a libel. The chevalier at fir&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of his let|ters.</NOTE> thought him&s;elf protected by his character, but he &s;oon found that the laws of England were &s;uperior even to the king. He wrote and printed letters to the lord chief ju&s;tice Mansfield, the earl of Bute, earl Temple, and Mr. Pitt, weakly imagining that he might thereby unite both to the court and op|po&s;ition in his favour. Finding all his efforts for that purpo&s;e ineffectual, he endeavoured to intere&s;t the public in his quarrel by the following alarm|ing declaration, which he publi&s;hed: "I am, &s;ays he, a&s;&s;ured, from undoubted authority, that my enemies have re&s;olved to carry me off by force or

<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged that the chevalier could not have fallen upon a more effectual me|thod for prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the public of England in his favour, than by the above pretext; but to add commi&s;eration to re&s;entment in his letter addre&s;&s;ed to lord Mansfield, he had the following expre&s;|&s;ions: "I carefully avoid every one the lea&s;t in|fringement of the laws; if the laws then were to appear armed again&s;t my liberty, ought not I to &s;uppo&s;e it a pretence u&s;ed by my enemies to get me in their power; and in this ca&s;e, does not the laws authori&s;e me to repel force by force; and &s;hould the mo&s;t fatal accidents re&s;ult from &s;uch a &s;tep, were the&s;e laws to condemn me, which I cannot conceive, the &s;pirit of tho&s;e laws mu&s;t feel the &s;troke." The voice of the public certainly be-friended the chevalier, till it was di&s;covered that his apprehen&s;ions were entirely without founda|tion; and being found guilty of a libel again&s;t the count de Guerchy, he was forced to ab&s;cond. This drew upon him many legal cen&s;ures, and the public were for &s;ome time amazed at a pompous account publi&s;hed in the news papers, of a private hou&s;e in Scotland-Yard having been broken open by &s;ix per&s;ons to find him; but this was &s;oon di&s;|covered

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of Mr. Legge's papers.</NOTE> The death of Mr. Legge about this time rai&s;ed the expectations of the public to an inconceiveable degree. He had informed his friends, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of papers, that would &s;et the late mi|ni&s;ter, the earl of B. and his arbitrary principles, in the mo&s;t odious light; and he had even the weakne&s;s to exact from a per&s;on he had no great knowledge of, but who attended him in his dying hours, a promi&s;e that tho&s;e papers &s;hould be pub|li&s;hed after his death. The report of this &s;pread abroad, the expectations of the publick were rai&s;ed, and even an impeachment was talked of again&s;t the accu&s;ed nobleman. The papers were publi&s;hed with a mo&s;t exaggerated character of Mr. Legge, extolling him as the greate&s;t mini&s;ter, the fine&s;t gentleman, and one of the be&s;t men that this country or age had produced. The whole of this formidable charge proved to be a de&s;ire which his pre&s;ent m&mdash;, very po&s;&s;ibly by lord B's in|fluence, had, that Sir Simeon Stuart &s;hould be cho&s;en to repre&s;ent the county of Southampton, for which Mr. Legge had declared him&s;elf a can|didate. An inva&s;ion at that time was threatened from France, and as that county may be con&s;ider|ed as a maritime province of England, lord B. thought it neither decent nor proper, that it &s;hould be involved or divided in a parliamentary bu&s;tle at &s;o critical a juncture; and he therefore prevailed with Mr. Legge's antagoni&s;t to drop his preten|&s;ions.
<PB N="432" REF="4400">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Mr. Legge had notice of this from Mr. Martin, then &s;ecretary of the Trea&s;ury, at lord B's reque&s;t; but he treated it as an idle compliment, becau&s;e his intere&s;t in the county was va&s;tly &s;upe|rior to that of his rival, who was then only Mr. Stuart. In the year 1769, when the general elec|tion took place, the prince of Wales &s;ent Mr. Legge a me&s;&s;age, expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ire that he would drop all thoughts of &s;tanding for that county, and &s;upport the nomination of his royal highne&s;s in favour of the marquis of Carnarvon and Mr. Stuart. Mr. Legge pretended that he was too far engaged with the gentlemen of the county to retract, and declared his intentions to &s;tand, which Mr. Martin, by lord B.'s de&s;ire, beg|ged him to con&s;ider of before he went too far in oppo&s;ing the inclinations of his royal highne&s;s.</P>

Having thus given a faithful account from the papers them|&s;elves of this long expected charge, the reader can &s;carcely expect that we &s;hould dwell upon its futi|lity, or take great pains to prove that it bla&s;ted the hopes of the party when it appeared in public. It was known that lord B. even after the general elec|tion, had done &s;ervices to Mr. Legge, and had intere&s;ted him&s;elf in making up differences be|tween him and other con&s;iderable per&s;onages in the mini&s;try, who began to think him not to be of that importance which he a&s;&s;umed.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> An affair of much greater con&s;equence to the nation than debates among &s;tate&s;men at this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the di&s;|covery of the longi|tude.</NOTE> engaged the public attention, and this regarded the di&s;covery of the longitude, which the parliament of England had long and generou&s;ly patronized. In December 1763, Mr. John Harri&s;on, who had for &s;everal years applied him&s;elf to that momentous &s;tudy, had completed what he called a Time-keeper, and he wrote a circular invitation to twelve noblemen and gentlemen, of indi&s;putable integrity and abilities, to meet daily at his hou&s;e to examine the exactitude of this time-keeper, as it was &s;oon to be &s;ent to America for trial of the longitude. They accordingly agreed to compare it every day with a regulator, fixed in the &s;ame hou&s;e, which, for thirty years together, had &s;eldom been known to vary from the rate of mean &s;olar time more than about one &s;econd in a month; and that the going of the &s;aid regulator it&s;elf &s;hould likewi&s;e be$a&s;cer|tained by means of an accurate in&s;trument, al&s;o in the hou&s;e, for ob&s;erving the &s;un's tran&s;it over the meridian, as often as the weather would permit. After each compari&s;on, both the time-keeper and regulator were &s;ealed up by the company, and the re&s;ult was, that upon the la&s;t compari&s;on, the time-keeper was found in eight days to have gain|ed upon the regulator, nine &s;econds and &s;ix-tenths of a &s;econd. To rectify tho&s;e &s;mall inequalities ari&s;ing from the various temperature of the air, Mr. Harri&s;on took his time-keeper a&s;under, but, be|fore he could execute his purpo&s;e, the Tartar man of war was ordered to take his &s;on with it on board, that he might proceed to $word$ upon the

The &s;hip &s;ailed from Spithead, March the 28th, and met with very rough weather, e&s;pecially in the Bay of Bi&s;cay, but arrived at Barbadoes on the 13th of May following. Mr. Harri&s;on, during the cour&s;e of the voyage, declared to a mo&s;t &s;urprizing degree of certainty, how far the &s;hip was from that i&s;land. Mr. Harri&s;on, on the 4th of June, &s;et out in another &s;hip from Barbadoes; and, on his re|turn, was equally exact in his calculations, as ap|peared by proper certificates. Upon his arrival in England a board of longitude was held, and the commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;o well &s;atisfied with Mr. Har|ri&s;on's di&s;covery, that they gave him an immediate order to be paid one thou&s;and pounds. But how far the commi&s;&s;ioners may think him entitled to the whole of the premium, without any farther trial and di&s;covery, is yet unknown.</P>

From the fir&s;t time of its in&s;titution in the year 1755 the members had expended near twenty thou&s;and pounds premiums, for the advancement of the arts and u&s;eful di&s;coveries. The &s;upplying London with fi&s;h at a &s;mall expence had been for &s;ome years one of their main objects, and they had &s;o good opinion of the capacity and integrity of Mr. Blake, one of their members, for managing that impor|tant

His &s;cheme was, for &s;ome time, car|ried with great vigour into execution, by con&s;truct|ing machines for bringing fi&s;h to the London markets by land-carriage; a method which, tho' very expen&s;ive, an&s;wered &s;o well at fir&s;t, that in Fe|bruary the &s;ociety almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly relea&s;ed him from his obligation, for repaying one thou&s;and five hundred pounds that had been advanced him. He was not equally fortunate in his pro&s;ecution of this laudable project, occa&s;ioned, as was alledged by the combinations of the fi&s;h-mongers, who un|der&s;old him; but the experiments he made were undoubtedly of infinite &s;ervice to the public, and proved how practicable it is to &s;upply the citizens of London with fi&s;h, at ea&s;ier rates than they have heretofore been ac$u&s;tomed to pay. The &s;ame patriot &s;pirit di&s;covered it&s;elf in all other proceed|ings of the &s;ociety, tho' de&s;titute of any legal con&s;titution.

A l ke &s;pirit of beneficence and liberality prevailed in a number of other public in&s;t tutions. Ho&s;pitals with large endowments were reared in many parts of the capital of the kingdom; $word$ for orphans were erected, and even female pro&s;titution was re&s;cued from temptation, and the unhappy nece&s;&s;ity of con|tinuing in the paths of infamy, by a decent provi|&s;ion for the unfortunate women who rendered them&s;elves, by the r p$nitence, objects of $word$ $word$ $o $$wer than five hundred and eighty three per&s;ons were taken into this charity, $span$ on the 1$th of Augu&s;t 1758, to $span$ 1$64; and next month $span$ thou&s;and two hundred pounds was col|lected at the anniver&s;ary meeting of the benefactors.</P>

journeymen &s;ilk-weavers re&s;iding in Spitalfields<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> repaired to his maje&s;ty's palace, where they pre|&s;ented<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Spital|fields weavers.</NOTE> a petition repre&s;enting the mi&s;erable condi|tion them&s;elves and their families were reduced to by the clande&s;tine importation of French &s;ilks. The petitioners were con&s;iderable, not only by their numbers but their utillity; and his maje&s;ty, with the greate&s;t affability and conde&s;cen&s;ion, gave them for an&s;wer, that an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence to the kingdom &s;hould be properly laid before the parliament, and that they might depend on his care and protection. About the &s;ame time a number of French patterns for &s;ilks were &s;aid to be handed about by the French emi&s;&s;aries to the London mer|cers; and it was given out, that the latter were &s;upplied with any pattern and to any quantity of &s;ilk manufactured in France. It does not appear<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of the Spi|talfields weavers.</NOTE> that tho&s;e reports had really any other foundation, than that of exciting the charity of the public, which flowed in for the relief of the &s;ufferers in plentiful &s;treams, and was di&s;tributed to them with the ut|mo&s;t ju&s;tice and impartiality.

It was alledged, that a few experiments of this kind would excite in the public that noble &s;pirit of well judged charity, which con|&s;i&s;ts

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> in giving employment to indu&s;try rather than relief to idlene&s;s; and the &s;pace of a few weeks confirmed the truth of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations. The money, during that time, was &s;pent, and far from re|lieving the &s;ufferers, it &s;erved only to confirm them in their habits of indolence. The news-papers of every week were filled with accounts of their di&s;|tre&s;$es and of their tumultuous applications for re|lief, which was impo&s;&s;ible at that time to be given them, but from private per&s;ons, who&s;e charity be|gan now to be exhau&s;ted, in propo$tion as the clamour encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e,</NOTE> About the 14th of May the meetings of tho&s;e journeymen weavers, on account of a bill, which they thought tended to their relief, being thrown out of the hou&s;e of peers, began to be more nu|merous than was con&s;i&s;tent with the peace of civil government, and their re&s;entment was particularly pointed at the duke of B. who, as they had been in|formed, was a principal oppo&s;er of the bill. A num|ber of tho&s;e in&s;urgents were &s;o ill advi&s;ed as to a&s;&s;emble tog$ther; and, being accompanied with their wives and children, and preceded by a bl$ck flag as an emblem of their di&s;tre&s;t circum|&s;tances, went up to St. James's to repre&s;ent once more to his maje&s;ty, the hard&s;hips they &s;uffered for want of work on occa&s;ion of the importation of French and other &s;ilks. Though both the king and the queen had gone to Richmond before they arrived at St. James's, yet &s;o earne&s;t were they in their &s;oli$itation, that they even followed their maje&s;ti$s to tho&s;e retreats which ought to be &s;acred from intr$&s;ion and importunity; and finding means

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">progre&s;s,</NOTE> The appearance of this numerous body was &s;o formidable to the peace of the city of London, that the lord-mayor and court of aldermen ordered the beadles of the &s;everal wards to give notice to the con&s;tables in every pari&s;h, to repair immediately to their re&s;pective watch-hou&s;es, with a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and there to remain till farther orders, to prevent any riots that might happen. Though the king had by this time pa&s;&s;ed a bill for laying &s;everal additional duties on the importation of wrought &s;ilks and velvets, and to encourage the &s;ilk manufacture of this kingdom, and to prevent any combinations of workmen; yet this was far from pacifying the in&s;urgents. On the 16th of May another great body went to St. James's, where they repeated their former reque&s;ts, and receiving a favourable an&s;wer, they retired to the Green-Park, where they drew round a per&s;on, one Jones, who, if not their leader, had obtained their tru&s;t and confidence, and on him they &s;eemed to depend for advice. As their numbers now, upon the whole, were &s;aid to amount to above fifteen thou&s;and, the moderation of Jones was very exemplary. He advi&s;ed them to di&s;per&s;e, and dutifully to wait the re&s;ult of what his maje&s;ty and the parliament intended in their favour; with which they &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied. It &s;oon appeared that a number of nece&s;&s;itous and riotous people, who were no weavers, but pretended to be &s;uch, had mingled in the mob. There is &s;carcely in hi&s;tory

Several of the nobility and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, heard their complaints, and te&s;tified their compa&s;&s;ion for their &s;ufferings, with which they &s;eemed to be &s;atis|fied, till &s;uch of their number as really had bad de&s;igns, found means to inflame them again&s;t the noble duke above-mentioned; then, in&s;tead of re|turning to their re&s;pective habitations, they a&s;&s;em|bled in Bloomsbury-&s;quare, where the decency they had hitherto ob&s;erved for&s;ook them, and they be|haved in a mo&s;t riotous and audacious manner. On the 17th of the &s;ame month, their numbers, by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">and $word$ of their riots.</NOTE> public papers, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be fifty thou&s;and; and after being mu&s;tered, and receiving their or|ders from officers of their own chu&s;ing, they pro|ceeded to We&s;tmin&s;ter in three bodies. One went over London-bridge to We&s;tmin&s;ter by St. George's-fields; another by Holborn and Covent|garden, and the third along Ludgate-hill and the Strand. When the junction of tho&s;e three bo|dies was formed in Old and New Palace&punc;yard and the neighbourhood, the avenues to both hou&s;es of parliament were &s;o crowded, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty the members could pa&s;s to their re&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies. Nothing was wanting that could in&s;pire them with compa&s;&s;ion for the petitio|ners, at they termed them&s;elves. Flags of various colours, borne by women, compo&s;ed of French manufactures, were di&s;played, and the mercers in

The men wore red cockades and &s;hreds of &s;ilk in their hats, and they &s;topt the carriages of the members as they were endeavouring to pa&s;s along, praying them to take pity on the poor weavers; but they behaved in all other re&s;pects with the utmo&s;t regularity, and even checked &s;uch of their own number as &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to be riotous.</P>
<P>But though this alarming body of in&s;urgents continued &s;till to di&s;cover no di&s;po&s;ition to in|&s;ult government, yet, at the &s;ame time, their a&s;&s;embling, in the manner they did, required the &s;tricte&s;t attention. The fir&s;t troop of hor&s;e-guards, with a party of hor&s;e&punc;grenadiers and three companies of the foot-guards, all under arms, and headed by their proper officers, were ordered from the parade to Old Palace-yard, where they were drawn up in two lines before We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, to clear the pa&s;&s;age for the members to get to the hou&s;e. In the mean time, the ju&s;tices of the peace for We&s;tmin&s;ter had attended at the New Guildhall; at which place there was al&s;o a con|ference between the chieftains of the weavers, to the number of about four hundred, their ma&s;ters, and the mercers, when it was agreed by the latter immediately to recall all their contracts for foreign goods, and to &s;et the journeymen in&s;tantly to work. This expedient in all probability would have quieted them, had not &s;ome of their fal&s;e brethren &s;ugge&s;ted, while they were upon their return home, that they were in&s;ecure in their dependence upon promi&s;es; and that upon application they might be joined by

One hou&s;e of the legi&s;lature, however, did not think that &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction had been made for the in&s;ults which had been done to their members and to government in general; and certain cen&s;ures were impo&s;ed for the too great lenity that had been u&s;ed in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch daring in&s;ults.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> During the above in&s;urrection an uncommon fer|ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of parties.</NOTE> prevailed at court, which the nece&s;&s;ity of appearing to act with unanimity had long &s;tifled. Tho&s;e who formed the minority in parliament, had originally accu$ed the acting mini&s;ters of being no better than &s;ub&s;titutes to the earl of B. They en|deavoured to wipe off the a&s;per&s;ion, by a&s;&s;uming every mark of independency upon his lord&s;hip, who &s;eemed to have entirely re&s;igned him&s;elf to the duties of a private life, and to be quite uncon|nected with public bu&s;ine&s;s. This inoffen&s;ive con|duct, however, was far from protecting his charac|ter from the &s;hafts of envy and malevolence, and every day produced from the pre&s;s fre&s;h informa|tions to the public, that he &s;till had underhand the direction of all the great movements of &s;tate, but without any particular in&s;tance of his influence be|ing &s;pecified, otherwi&s;e than by &s;urmize and &s;u&s;pi|cion. An alarming con&s;ideration cleared up the gloom that was the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of that want of confidence, which was vi&s;ible through many of the departments of publick bu&s;ine&s;s. Towards the &s;pring of the year his maje&s;ty was attacked with an illne&s;s, which tho' not dangerous, filled the public with prodigious apprehen&s;ions, which perhaps were encrea&s;ed by the very means made u&s;e of to &s;ave appearances; as nothing of certainty could be gathered from the public papers, but that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speech of the king concern|ing a re|gency.</NOTE> the &s;tate of his health was precarious. Upon his recovery on the 22d of April he went in &s;tate to the Hou&s;e of Peers, where, after giving his a&s;&s;ent to the bills that were ready, he made a &s;peech to both hou&s;es of parliament, in which he told them,

that the tender concern he felt for his faithful<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> &s;ubjects, made him anxious to provide for every po&s;&s;ible event, which might affect their happine&s;s and &s;ecurity. That his late indi&s;po&s;ition, though not attended with danger, had led him to con&s;ider the &s;ituation in which his kingdoms and his fa|mily might be left, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to put a period to his life whil&s;t his &s;ucce&s;&s;or was of tender years. That the high importance of this &s;ubject to the public &s;afety, good order, and tranquility; the paternal affection which he bore to his chil|dren and to all his people, and his earne&s;t de&s;ire, that every precaution &s;hould be taken, which might tend to pre&s;erve the con&s;titution of Great Britain undi&s;turbed, and the dignity of its crown unimpaired, had determined him to lay this weighty bu&s;ine&s;s before his parliament; and as his health, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, was now re&s;tored, he took the earlie&s;t opportunity of meeting them, and re|commending to their mo&s;t &s;erious deliberation, the making &s;uch provi&s;ion as would be nece&s;&s;ary, in ca&s;e any of his children &s;hould &s;ucceed to his throne before they &s;hould re&s;pectively attain the age of eighteen years.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu|&s;ion.</NOTE> Such is the &s;ub&s;tance of this important act, the account of which we have anticipated a few months, on account of the great con&s;equences with which it was attended; for the moment they pa&s;&s;ed, the public report was, that the mini&s;try was unhinged. It is certain that &s;ome changes took place, but upon what principles they were effected, or what farther alterations may be &s;till nece&s;&s;ary for e&s;tabli&s;hing the fabric of government upon a &s;olid and a permanent plan, is yet unknown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1&punc; 1765.</NOTE> We have, according to the be&s;t of our abilities, exhibited in this Continuation a faithful hi&s;tory of the reign of George the Third to the beginning of the year 1765, and after the mo&s;t attentive re|view, we can find no rea&s;on for altering the repre|&s;entation of any fact we have publi&s;hed. It never has been di&s;puted, that at the time of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, this kingdom was unable to &s;upport either with men or money the continuance of the war, however flattering the pro&s;|pect of its &s;ucce&s;s might be. The countries in which it mu&s;t have been carried on, are the mo&s;t fatal to Briti&s;h con&s;titutions of any in the globe; and an immediate &s;upply of above forty thou&s;and men, for &s;ea and land forces, was required, at a

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> time when the country was exhau&s;ted of inhabi|tants, its fields uncultivated, its manufactures at a &s;tand; and when it was found ab&s;olutely imprac|ticable to rai&s;e five thou&s;and recruits more for fleet or army. The national debt was &s;welled to the in|credible $um of almo&s;t a hundred and thirty mil|lion; and twenty millions more, with a mo&s;t preca|rious pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, mu&s;t have been the ex|pence of another campaign. Thus every year would have &s;welled a debt, which the mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectation could not have found the means of di&s;|charging, even by the mo&s;t glorious conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>We have, we hope, with candour, &s;tated the hi&s;|tory of the cyder act, which was nece&s;&s;ary for pay|ing off part of that great &s;um, and given &s;uch an account of the ca&s;e of general warrants, which is one of the great charges again&s;t his maje&s;ty's go|vernment, as we flatter our&s;elves is not to be con|verted by the mo&s;t virulent enemy of the admini|&s;tration. With regard to foreign affairs, all the alle|gations brought again&s;t the management of them, are comprehended under the head of the undi&s;|charged Canada bills and the Manilla ran&s;om, both which articles are yet unadju&s;ted. In all other re|&s;pects, the two great powers with whom we were at war, have fulfilled the articles of the general peace with a good faith and punctuality, of which we have few or no examples in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
