<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ubject propos'd. Addre&s;s to Mr. <HI>ONSLOW.</HI> A pro&s;|pect
of the fields ready for harve&s;t. Reaping. A tale.
A harve&s;t &s;term. Shooting and hunting, their barbari|ty.
A ludicrous account of fox-hunting. A view of an
orchard. Wall-fruit. A vineyard. A de&s;cription of
Fogs, frequent in the latter part of <HI>AUTUMN:</HI> whence a
digre&s;&s;ion, enquiring into the ri&s;e of fountains and rivers.
Birds of &s;ea&s;on con&s;idered, that now &s;hift their habitation.
The prodigious number of them that cover the northern
and we&s;tern I&s;les of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence a view of the
country. A pro&s;pect of the di&s;coloured, fading woods.
After a gentle dusky day, moon-light. Autumnal Me|teors.
Morning: to which &s;ucceeds a calm, pure, &s;un|&s;hine
day, &s;uch as u&s;ually &s;huts up the &s;ea&s;on. The har|ve&s;t
being gathered in, the country di&s;&s;olv'd in joy. The
whole concludes with a panegyrick on a philo&s;ophical coun|$ry
life.</P>
