<HEAD>A
DEFENCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE fair way of conducting a
di&s;pute, is to exhibit one by one
the arguments of your opponent, and
with each argument the preci&s;e and &s;pe|cific
an&s;wer you are able to give it. If
this method be not &s;o common, nor
found &s;o convenient as might be expect|ed,
the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e it &s;uits not
always with the de&s;igns of a writer,
which are no more perhaps than to make
a <HI>Book;</HI> to confound &s;ome arguments,
and keep others out of &s;ight; to leave
what is called an <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> upon the
reader, without any care to inform him
of the proofs or principles by which
his opinion &s;hould be governed. With
&s;uch views, it may be con&s;i&s;tent to di&s;|patch
<PB N="2" REF="4">
objections, by ob&s;erving of &s;ome
<HI>that they are old,</HI> and therefore like cer|tain
drugs have lo&s;t, we may &s;uppo&s;e,
their &s;trength; of others, that <HI>they have
long &s;ince received an an&s;wer;</HI> which im|plies,
to be &s;ure, a confutation: To
attack &s;traggling remarks, and decline
the main rea&s;oning, as <HI>mere declamation;</HI>
to pa&s;s by one pa&s;&s;age becau&s;e it is <HI>long-winded,</HI>
another becau&s;e the An&s;werer
<HI>has neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to enter
into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it;</HI> to produce ex|tracts
and quotations, which taken alone,
imperfectly if at all expre&s;s their author's
meaning; to di&s;mi&s;s a &s;tubborn difficulty
with a <HI>reference,</HI> which ten to one the
reader never looks at: and la&s;tly, in order
to give the whole a certain fa&s;hionable air
of candour and moderation, to make a
conce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Such as, <HI>that if people keep their opinions to them&s;elves, no man will hurt them,</HI> and the like. An&s;wer, p. 45.</NOTE> or two which nobody thanks
him for, or yield up a few points which
it is no longer any credit to maintain.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
How far the writer with whom we
have to do is concerned in this de&s;cription,
his readers will judge; he &s;hall receive,
however, from us that ju&s;tice which he
has not &s;hewn the author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI>
to have his arguments fully and
di&s;tinctly &s;tated and examined.</P>
<P>After complaining, as is u&s;ual on the&s;e
occa&s;ions, of <HI>di&s;appointment</HI> and di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction;
the An&s;werer &s;ets out with an
argument which compri&s;es, we are told,
in a <HI>narrow compa&s;s,</HI> the whole merits of
the que&s;tion betwixt us; and which is
neither more nor le&s;s than this, that <HI>it is
nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e who are to be ordained
teachers in the Church &s;hould be &s;ound in
the faith, and con&s;equently that they &s;hould
give to tho&s;e who ordain them &s;ome proof
and a&s;&s;urance that they are &s;o, and that the
method of this proof &s;hould be &s;ettled by
public Authority.</HI>&mdash;Now the perfection
of this &s;ort of rea&s;oning is, that it comes
as well from the mouth of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity in the Univer&s;ity of
<HI>Bologna,</HI> as from the <HI>Clarendon</HI> pre&s;s.
<PB N="4" REF="6">
A Church has only with our Author to
call her Creed <HI>the faithful word,</HI> and it
follows from Scripture that <HI>we mu&s;t hold
it fa&s;t.</HI> Her di&s;&s;atisfied &s;ons, let her
only denominate, as he does<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE>, <HI>vain
talkers and deceivers,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf
commands us to <HI>&s;top their mouths.</HI> Every
one that que&s;tions or oppo&s;es her de|ci&s;ions
&s;he pronounces, with him, a
heretic, and <HI>a man that is an heretic after
the fir&s;t and &s;econd admonition reject.</HI> In
like manner, calling her tenets <HI>&s;ound
doctrine,</HI> or taking it for granted that
they are &s;o (which the Conclave at <HI>Rome</HI>
can do as well as the Convocation at
<HI>London</HI>) and <HI>&s;oundne&s;s in the faith being
a nece&s;&s;ary qualification in a Chri&s;tian
Teacher,</HI> there is no avoiding the con|clu&s;ion,
that every <HI>Chri&s;tian Teacher</HI> (in,
and out of the Church too, if you can
catch him, <HI>&s;oundne&s;s in the faith</HI> being
alike <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in all) mu&s;t have the&s;e tenets
&s;trapped about his neck by Oaths and
Sub&s;criptions. An argument which thus
fights in any cau&s;e, or on either &s;ide,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
de&s;erves no quarter.&mdash;I have &s;aid that
this rea&s;oning, and the&s;e applications of
Scripture are equally competent to the
defenders of <HI>Popery</HI>&mdash;they are more &s;o.
The Popes, when they a&s;&s;umed the power
of the Apo&s;tles, laid claim al&s;o to their
infallibility; and in this they were con|&s;i&s;tent.
Prote&s;tant Churches renounce
with all their might this infallibility,
whil&s;t they apply to them&s;elves every
expre&s;&s;ion that de&s;cribes it, and will not
part with a jot of the Authority which is
built upon it.&mdash;But to return
to the terms of the argument. <HI>Is it nece&s;&s;ary that a
Chri&s;tian Teacher &s;hould be &s;ound in the
faith?</HI></P>
<Q><P>1. Not in nine in&s;tances out of ten
to which the Te&s;t is now extended.
Nor</P>
<P>2. If it were, is this the way to make
him &s;o; there being as little proba|bility
that the determinations of a &s;et
of men who&s;e good fortune had ad|vanced
them to high &s;tations in the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Church &s;hould be right, as the con|clu&s;ions
of private enquirers. Nor</P>
<P>3. Were they actually right, is it po&s;&s;ible
to conceive how they can, upon this
author's principles, produce the effect
contended for. Since <HI>we &s;et them
not up</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 10, 11, 13, 29.</NOTE> <HI>as a rule of faith;</HI> &s;ince <HI>they
do not decide matters for us, nor bind
them upon us;</HI> &s;ince <HI>they tie no man
up from altering his opinion,</HI> are <HI>no
ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the right of pri|vate
judgment,</HI> are in a word, of no
more authority than an old Sermon;
nor con&s;equently much more effectual,
either for the producing or &s;ecuring
of <HI>&s;oundne&s;s in the faith.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The An&s;werer not tru&s;ting altogether
to the &s;trength of his <HI>argument,</HI> endea|vours
next to avail him&s;elf of a <HI>conce&s;&s;ion</HI>
which he has gained, he imagines, from
his adver&s;ary, and which he is plea&s;ed
to look upon <HI>as in a manner giving up
the main point.</HI> Our bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
will be to &s;hew what this conce&s;&s;ion, as
he calls it, amounts to, and wherein it
differs from the <HI>main point,</HI> the requi|&s;ition
of Sub&s;cription to e&s;tabli&s;hed for|mularies.
It is objected to the Articles
of the Church of England, that they are
at variance with the actual opinions both
of the Governors and Members of that
Church; &s;o much &s;o, that the men who
mo&s;t faithfully and explicitly maintain
the&s;e Articles, get per&s;ecuted for their
&s;ingularity, excluded from Orders, driven
from Univer&s;ities, and are compelled to
preach the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, in fields
and conventicles.&mdash;Now this objection,
which mu&s;t cleave to every <HI>fixed</HI> formu|lary,
might, we conceive, be removed if
a Te&s;t was &s;ub&s;tituted, &s;uppo&s;ing any Te&s;t
to be in&s;i&s;ted upon, which could adapt
it&s;elf to the opinions, and keep pace with
the improvements, of each &s;ucceeding
age. This, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, would be
the ca&s;e if the Governors of the Church
for the time being, were authori&s;ed to
receive from Candidates for orders del|clarations
<PB N="8" REF="10">
of their religious principles in
their own words, and allowed, at their
di&s;cretion, to admit them into the Mini|&s;try.
Bi&s;hops being taken out of the
lump of the community will generally
be of the &s;ame leaven, and partake, both
of the opinions and moderation of the
times they live in.&mdash;This is the mo&s;t
that can be made of the conce&s;&s;ion, and
how this gives up the <HI>main point,</HI> or
indeed any thing, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;|cover.</P>
<P>The next paragraph of the An&s;wer
attacks the account which the <HI>Con&s;idera|tions</HI>
have given of the <HI>ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>progre&s;s</HI>
of the cu&s;tom in que&s;tion, <HI>the rever&s;e of
which</HI> the An&s;werer tell us <HI>is the truth,</HI>
and by way of proof gives his own
account of the matter, which, &s;o far
from being the <HI>rever&s;e,</HI> is in effect, or
very nearly, the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The reader &s;hall &s;ee the two accounts
&s;ide by &s;ide, and is de&s;ired to judge
whether the Author of the Con&s;idera|tions,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
&s;o far from being confuted in this
point, is even contradicted.</P>
<P>&startq;The prote&s;tants,
aware how greatly they
were mi&s;repre&s;ented and
abu&s;ed, began to think
it nece&s;&s;ary to repell the
various calumnies that
had been ca&s;t upon them,
by &s;etting forth &s;ome
public Con&s;titutions or
Confe&s;&s;ions, as a declara|tion
of their faith and
wor&s;hip. And to make
&s;uch declaration &s;till more
authentic, they likewi&s;e
engaged them&s;elves in a
mutual bond of confor|mity
to all the&s;e Con|&s;titutions.&endq;
Con&s;idera|tions,
page 6.</P>
<P>&startq;As &s;ome who &s;et up
for reformers, had broach|ed
many erroneous and
pe&s;tilent doctrines; the
<HI>Lutherans</HI> fir&s;t, and, after
their example, other pro|te&s;tant
Churches, thought
fit to draw up Confe&s;&s;|ions
of Faith. And this
they did, partly to acquit
them&s;elves of the &s;candal
of abetting wild and &s;e|ditious
enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and
declaring what were their
real doctrines: partly
(ob&s;erve how tenderly
this is introduced) to pre|vent
&s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;ts on
the one hand, and popi&s;h
emi&s;&s;aries on the other,
from intruding them|&s;elves
into the mini&s;try.&endq;
An&s;wer, page 6, 7.</P>
<P>Now were the <HI>origin</HI> of a cu&s;tom of
more con&s;equence than it is to a que&s;tion
concerning the <HI>propriety</HI> of it, can any
<PB N="10" REF="12">
one doubt who credits even the An|&s;werer's
own account, but that the motive
a&s;&s;igned in the Con&s;iderations both did
exi&s;t, and was the principal motive.
There is one account, indeed, of the
<HI>origin</HI> of this cu&s;tom which, were it true,
would directly concern the que&s;tion.
<HI>This practice,</HI> our Author tells us in
another part of his An&s;wer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Page 19.</NOTE>, <HI>is &s;aid to
be derived from the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves.</HI>
I care not what <HI>is &s;aid.</HI>&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible
that the practice complained of, the
impo&s;ition of articles of faith by <HI>fallible</HI>
men, could originate from the <HI>Apo&s;tels,</HI>
who, under the direction by which they
acted, were <HI>infallible</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>How a Creed is to be made, as the Con&s;ide|rations recommend, in which all parties &s;hall agree, our Author cannot under&s;tand. I will tell him how; by adhering to &s;cripture terms: and this will &s;uit the be&s;t idea of a Creed (a &s;ummary or compendium of a larger volume) and the only fair purpo&s;e of one, <HI>in&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved in the Con&s;iderations, that the multiplicity of the propo&s;itions contained in the 39 Articles is alone &s;ufficient to &s;hew the impo&s;&s;i|bility of that con&s;ent which the Church &s;uppo&s;es and requires.&mdash;Now, what would any man gue&s;s is the an&s;wer to this? Why, <HI>that there are no le&s;s than three propo&s;itio$s in the very fir&s;t ver&s;e of St. John's Go&s;pel.</HI> Had there been <HI>three thou&s;and</HI> it would have been nothing to the purpo&s;e: Where propo&s;itions are received upon the Authority of the propo&s;er, it matters not how many of them there are; the doubt is not increa&s;ed with the number; the &s;ame rea&s;on which e&s;tabli&s;hes one e&s;tabli&s;hes all. But is this the ca&s;e with a &s;y&s;tem of propo&s;itions which derives no evidence from the propo&s;er? which mu&s;t each &s;tand upon its own &s;eparate and intrin&s;ic proof?&mdash;We thought it nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e note to note in the place in which we found it, though neither here nor in the An&s;wer is it much connected with the Text.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
But this practice, from whatever <HI>root
of bitterne&s;s</HI> it &s;prung, has been one of
the chief cau&s;es, we a&s;&s;ert, of the divi|&s;ions
and di&s;tre&s;&s;es which we read of in
eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory. The matter of fact
our Author does not, becau&s;e he cannot,
deny. He rather chu&s;es to infinaate
that <HI>&s;uch divi&s;ions and di&s;turbances were
not owing to the governors of the Church,
but to the perver&s;e di&s;putings of Heretics
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and Schi&s;matics.</HI>&mdash;He <HI>mu&s;t</HI> know, that
there is oppre&s;&s;ion as well as re&s;i&s;tance,
provocation as well as re&s;entment, abu&s;e
of power as well as oppo&s;ition to it;
and it is too much to take for granted,
without one &s;yllable of proof, that tho&s;e
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power have been always
in the right, and tho&s;e who with&s;tood
them in the wrong. <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> and <HI>di&s;|turbances</HI>
have in fact, and in all ages,
ari&s;en on this account, and it is a poor &s;hift
to &s;ay, becau&s;e it may always be &s;aid,
that &s;uch only are chargeable with the&s;e
mi&s;chiefs as refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to what|ever
their &s;uperiors thought proper to
impo&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The following &s;entiment of our Author's is too curious to be omitted; &startq;<HI>Po&s;&s;ibly too he</HI> (the Author of the Con&s;iderations) <HI>may think that in&s;urrections and rebellions in the &s;tate are not owing to the unruline&s;s of factious &s;ubjects, but to Kings and Rulers; but mo&s;t rea&s;onable men, I believe, will think otherwi&s;e.</HI>&endq;&mdash;A common reader may think this ob&s;ervation of the An&s;werer a little be&s;ide the que&s;|tion. But the An&s;werer may &s;ay, with <HI>Cicero</HI> and Dr. <HI>King,</HI> &startq;Su&s;cepto negotio, majus mihi quiddam propo&s;ui, in quo meam in Rempublicam volunta|tem populus per&s;picere po&s;&s;et,&endq;&mdash;Motto to Dr. K.'s Oration in 1749.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
Nor is it much better what he tells
us, <HI>that the&s;e &s;ubtilties of metaphy&s;ical
debate, which we complain of in our Arti|cles,
were introduced by the &s;everal here|tics
of tho&s;e times;</HI> e&s;pecially as it is evi|dent
that whoever fir&s;t introduced, it is
the <HI>Governors of the Church</HI> who &s;till
continue them.</P>
<P>But our Author cannot conceive what
all this, as relating to <HI>Creeds</HI> only and
<HI>Confe&s;&s;ions;</HI> to the <HI>terms of communion,</HI>
rather than of admi&s;&s;ion into the Mini|&s;try,
is to the purpo&s;e. Will he then
give up <HI>Creeds</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions?</HI> or will
his Church thank him for it if he does?
&mdash;a Church which, by transfu&s;ing the
&s;ub&s;tance of her Articles into the form
of her public wor&s;hip, has in effect
made the <HI>terms of communion</HI> and of ad|mi&s;&s;ion
into the Mini&s;try the &s;ame.
&mdash;This que&s;tion, like every other, however
naked you may &s;trip it by ab&s;traction,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
mu&s;t always be con&s;idered with a refe|rence
to the practice you wi&s;h to reform.</P>
<P>The Author of the Con&s;iderations
contends very properly that it is one of
the fir&s;t duties a Chri&s;tian owes to his
Ma&s;ter <HI>to keep his mind open and unbia&s;&s;ed</HI>
in religious enquiries. Can a man be
&s;aid to do this, who mu&s;t bring him&s;elf
to a&s;&s;ent to opinions propo&s;ed by an|other?
Who enters into a profe&s;&s;ion
where both his sub&s;i&s;tence and &s;ucce&s;s
depend upon his continuance in a par|ticular
per&s;ua&s;ion? In an&s;wer to this we
are informed, that the&s;e Articles are no
<HI>Rule of Faith</HI> (what not to tho&s;e who
&s;ub&s;cribe them?) that <HI>the Church deprives
no man of his right of private judgement</HI>
(&s;he cannot&mdash;&s;he hangs however a dead
weight upon it); that it is a <HI>very unfair
&s;tate of the ca&s;e to call Sub&s;cription a decal|ration
of our full and final per&s;ua&s;ion in
matters of faith;</HI> though if it be not a
<HI>full</HI> per&s;ua&s;ion, what is it? and ten to
one it will be <HI>final,</HI> when &s;uch con&s;e|quences
attend a change.&mdash;That, <HI>no man
<PB N="15" REF="17">
is hereby tied up from impartially examin|ing
the word of God,</HI> i. e. with the <HI>im|partiality</HI>
of a Man who mu&s;t <HI>eat</HI> or
<HI>&s;tarve,</HI> according as the examination
turns out; an <HI>impartiality</HI> &s;o &s;u&s;pected,
that a Court of Ju&s;tice would not receive
his evidence under half of the &s;ame
influence;&mdash;<HI>nor from altering his opinion
if he finds rea&s;on &s;o to do;</HI> which few, I
conceive, will <HI>find,</HI> when the alteration
mu&s;t co&s;t them &s;o dear. If one could
give credit to our Author in what he &s;ays
here, and in &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages of his
An&s;wer, one would &s;uppo&s;e that, in his
judgement at lea&s;t, Sub&s;cription re&s;trained
no man from adopting what opinion he
plea&s;ed, provided <HI>he does not think him&s;elf
bound openly to maintain it;</HI> that <HI>men may
retain their preferments, if they will but
keep their opinions to them&s;elves.</HI>&mdash;If this
be what the Church of England means,
let her &s;ay &s;o.&mdash;This is indeed what our
Author admits here, and yet from the
outery he has afterwards rai&s;ed again&s;t
all who continue in the Church whil&s;t
they di&s;&s;ent from her Articles, one would
<PB N="16" REF="18">
not &s;uppo&s;e there was a pardon left for
tho&s;e, who <HI>keep even to them&s;elves an
opinion</HI> incon&s;i&s;tent with any one propo|&s;ition
they have &s;ub&s;cribed. The fact is,
the Gentleman has either &s;hifted his
opinion in the cour&s;e of writing the
An&s;wer, or had put down the&s;e a&s;&s;er|tions,
not expecting that he &s;hould have
occa&s;ion afterwards to contradict them.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed to add &s;trength to this ob|jection
that the judgement of mo&s;t think|ing
men being in a progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate,
their opinions of cour&s;e mu&s;t many of
them change; the evil and iniquity of
which the An&s;werer &s;ets forth with great
plea&s;antry, but has forgot at the &s;ame
time to give us any remedy for the mi&s;|fortune;
except the Old woman's receipt
to leave off thinking, for fear of think|ing
wrong.</P>
<P>But our Church <HI>preaches,</HI> it &s;eems, <HI>no
other Go&s;pel than that which &s;he received,</HI>
nor <HI>propounds any other articles for Go&s;pel,</HI>
nor <HI>fixes any &s;tandards or criterions of
<PB N="17" REF="19">
faith, &s;eparate from this Go&s;pel; and &s;o &s;he
her&s;elf fully declares;</HI> and we are to take
her <HI>word</HI> for it, when the very complaint
is, that &s;he has never <HI>acted</HI> up to this
declaration, but in direct contradiction to
it.&mdash;When &s;he puts forth a &s;y&s;tem of
propo&s;tions conceived in a new dialect,
and in un&s;criptural terms; when &s;he
a&s;cribes to the&s;e the &s;ame evidence and
certainty as to Scripture it&s;elf, or decrees
and acts as if they were equally evident
and certain, &s;he incurs, we apprehend,
the charge which the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions imply.
&mdash;She claims indeed <HI>Authority in contro|ver&s;ies
of faith,</HI> but <HI>only &s;o far,</HI> &s;ays her
Apologi&s;t, as <HI>to judge for her&s;elf what
&s;hall be her own terms of communion, and
what qualifications &s;he &s;hall require in her
own mini&s;ters.</HI> All which, in plainer
Engli&s;h, comes to this; that two or three
men betwixt two and three centuries ago,
fixed a multitude of ob&s;cure and dubious
propo&s;itions, which many millions after
mu&s;t bring them&s;elves to believe, before
they be permitted to &s;hare in the pro|vi&s;ion
which the State has made (and to
<PB N="18" REF="20">
which all of every &s;ect contribute) for
regular opportunities of public wor&s;hip,
and the giving and receiving of public
in&s;truction. And this our Author calls
the Magi&s;trate's <HI>judging for himself</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 26.</NOTE>, and
exerci&s;ing the <HI>&s;ame right as all other
per&s;ons have to judge for them&s;elves.</HI> For
the rea&s;onablene&s;s of it however he has
nothing to offer, but that it <HI>is no more
than what other Churches, Popi&s;h too,</HI> to
&s;trengthen the argument, <HI>as well as Pro|te&s;tant,</HI>
have done before. He might
have added, &s;eeing <HI>cu&s;tom</HI> is to determine
the matter, that it has been <HI>cu&s;tomary</HI> too
from early ages for Chri&s;tians to anathe|mati&s;e
and burn each other for difference
of opinion in &s;ome points of faith, and
for difference of practice in &s;ome points
of ceremony.</P>
<P>We now accompany the learned An|&s;werer
to what he is plea&s;ed to call the
<HI>main que&s;tion,</HI> and which he is &s;o much
<HI>puzzled to keep in &s;ight.</HI> The argu|ment<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">What would any man in his wits think of this argument, if upon the &s;trength of it they were to make a law, that none but red haired people &s;hould be admitted into orders, or even into churches?</NOTE>

in favour of Sub&s;cription, and
the arbitrary exclu&s;ion of men from the
Church or Mini&s;try, drawn from the
nature of a &s;ociety and the rights inci|dental
to &s;ociety, our Author re&s;igns to
its fate, and to the an&s;wer which has
been given it in the Con&s;iderations.
He contends only, that the conduct of
the Apo&s;tles in admitting the <HI>Eunuch</HI>
and the <HI>Centurion</HI> upon a general pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of their faith in Chri&s;t, <HI>has nothing
to do with the ca&s;e of Sub&s;cription,</HI> as they
were admitted, not into the Mini&s;try,
but only the communion of the Church.
Now, in the fir&s;t place, &s;uppo&s;e the
<HI>Eunuch</HI> or <HI>Centurion</HI> had taken upon
them, as probably they did, to teach
Chri&s;tianity, would they have been in|hibited
by the Apo&s;tles as not having
given &s;ufficient <HI>proof or a&s;&s;urance of their
&s;oundne&s;s in the faith?</HI> And if not, what
becomes of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch <HI>a&s;&s;u|rances
<PB N="20" REF="22">
from a Chri&s;tian teacher?</HI> In the
&s;econd place, &s;uppo&s;e you con&s;ider the
Church as one &s;ociety, and its teachers
as another, is it probable that the&s;e who
were &s;o tender in keeping any one out of
the fir&s;t, would have thought the argument
we were encountering, or any thing el&s;e,
a pretence for a right of arbitrary ex|clu&s;ion
from the latter? The ca&s;e of
<HI>Cornelius,</HI> &s;ays our Author, is <HI>extraordi|nary;
while St. Peter was preaching to
him, the Holy Gho&s;t fell upon all them
which heard the word.</HI> And is not this
Author a&s;hamed to own, that any are
excluded from the communion, or even
mini&s;try, of the Church, who would have
been entitled by their faith <HI>to the Gifts
of the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>The An&s;werer in the next paragraph
acknowledges, that to admit converts into
the Church upon this one Article of
faith, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is <HI>the Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> was
indeed the practice of the Apo&s;tles<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Although the que&s;tion, whether to believe that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is the Me&s;&s;iah, be not the only nece&s;&s;ary article of faith, is a que&s;tion in which we have no concern; our Author, with the be&s;t inclination in the world, not being able to fix &s;uch an opinion upon us. Yet I cannot help ob&s;erving, that he has put two of the odde&s;t con&s;tructions upon the terms of the propo&s;ition that ever entered into the fancy of man to conceive. One is, which you may be &s;ure he intends for his adver&s;aries<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>, <HI>that it is necce&s;&s;ary to believe Je&s;us to be a true prophet, yet not nece&s;&s;ary to believe one doctrine that he has taught.</HI> The other, which he means for him&s;elf, is that <HI>by the Me&s;&s;iah we are to under&s;tand the only begotten Son of God anointed and &s;ent by the Father to make pro|pitiation for the sins of the whole world.</HI></NOTE>;
<PB N="21" REF="23">
but then he tells us, what mu&s;t &s;ound a
little odd to a Chri&s;tian ear, and comes
the more aukwardly from this Author,
whom if you turn over a page, you will
find quoting the <HI>practice of the Apo&s;tles</HI>
with a vengeance: he tells us, I &s;ay, <HI>that
no argument can be drawn from the prac|tice
of the Apo&s;tles</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>. Now with regard
to the <HI>practice of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> and the
application of it to our&s;elves, the ca&s;e
&s;eems to be this (the very rever&s;e, ob|&s;erve,
of our Author's rule) that we are
always bound not <HI>to go beyond</HI> the pre|cedent,
<PB N="22" REF="24">
though for want of the &s;ame
authority, we may not always <HI>advance up
to it.</HI>&mdash;It &s;urely at lea&s;t becomes us to be
cautious of <HI>proceeding,</HI> where they in the
plenitude of their commi&s;&s;ion thought
proper to <HI>&s;top.</HI></P>
<P>It is alledged in the Con&s;iderations,
that annexing emoluments to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of particular opinions is a &s;trong
and dangerous inducement to prevarica|tion;
and the danger is the greater, as
prevarication in one in&s;tance has a ten|dency
to relax the mo&s;t &s;acred oblige|tions,
and make way for perfidy in
every other. But <HI>this,</HI> it &s;eems, <HI>has
nothing to do with the que&s;tion</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 19, 20.</NOTE>. Why,
it is the <HI>very</HI> que&s;tion, Whether the ma|gi&s;trate
ought to confine the provi&s;ion he
makes for religion to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ent,
or declare their a&s;&s;ent, to a particular
&s;y&s;tem of controverted divinity; and
this is one direct objection again&s;t it.
But <HI>mu&s;t the magi&s;trate then,</HI> exclaims
our alarmed adver&s;ary, <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h no tythes,
no rich benefices, no dignities, or Bi&s;hop|ricks?</HI>

As many as he plea&s;es, only let
him not convert them into &s;nares and

<HI>But mu&s;t he admit all per&s;ons indi&s;crimi|nately

of the Con&s;iderations has told him, that
he may require conformity to the Li|turgy,
Rites and Offices he &s;hall pre|&s;cribe:
he may tru&s;t his officers with a
di&s;cretion as to the religious principles of
candidates for orders, &s;imilar to what
they now exerci&s;e with regard to their
qualifications; he may cen&s;ure extra|vagant

&s;urely &s;ufficient either to keep
the <HI>wilde&s;t &s;ectaries</HI> out of the Church,
or prevent their doing any mi&s;chief if
they get in. The exclu&s;ion of Papi&s;ts
is a &s;eparate con&s;ideration. The Laws
again&s;t Popery, as far as they are ju&s;|tifiable,
proceed upon principles with
which the Author of the Con&s;iderations
has nothing to do. Where, from the
particular circum&s;tances of a country,
attachments and di&s;po&s;itions ho&s;tile and
dangerous to the &s;tate, are accidentally
<PB N="24" REF="26">
or otherwi&s;e connected with certain opi|nions
in religion, it may be necce&s;&s;ary
to lay incumbrances and re&s;traints upon
the profe&s;&s;ion, or propagation of &s;uch
opinions. Where <HI>a great part</HI> of any
&s;ect or religious order of men are ene|mies
to the con&s;titution, and you have
no way of di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e who are
not &s;o, it is right, perhaps, to fence the
<HI>whole</HI> order out of your civil and reli|gious
e&s;tabli&s;hment: it is the right at
lea&s;t of &s;elf-defence, and of extreme ne|ce&s;&s;ity.
But even this is not on account of
the religious opinions them&s;elves, but
as they are probable marks, and the only
marks you have, of de&s;igns and prin|ciples
which it is necce&s;&s;ary to di&s;arm. I
would ob&s;erve, however, that in propor|tion
as this connection between the civil
and religious principles of the Papi&s;ts
is di&s;&s;olved, in the &s;ame proportion
ought the &s;tate to mitigate the hard|&s;hips

they are made &s;ubject.</P>

<P>It has been thought to detract con&s;ide|rably

<P>Our Author, good man, <HI>is well per|&s;uaded,
that the generality of the Clergy,
when they offer them&s;elves for ordination,
con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly what office they take
upon them, and firmly believe what they
&s;ub&s;cribe to.</HI> I am <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> much other|wi&s;e.
But as this is a <HI>Fact,</HI> the Reader,
if he be wi&s;e, will neither take the An|&s;werer's
word for it nor mine: but form
his own judgment from his own ob&s;er|vation.
Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> complained above

becau&s;e they mu&s;t do it.</HI> Is it probable,
that in point either of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s or or|thodoxy
the Clergy are much mended
&s;ince?</P>
<P>The Pleas offered in &s;upport of this
practice of Sub&s;cription come next to be
con&s;idered. &startq;One of the&s;e is drawn
from the &s;acred writings being capable
of &s;uch a variety of &s;en&s;es, that men of
widely different per&s;ua&s;ions &s;helter them|&s;elves
under the &s;ame forms of expre&s;|&s;ion.&endq;
Our Author, after quarrelling
with this repre&s;entation of the plea, gives
his readers in its &s;tead a long quotation
from <HI>the Archdeacon of Oxford's Charge</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See this whole Charge an&s;wered <HI>In the London Chronicle by Pri&s;cilla.</HI>&mdash;The Lord hath &s;old <HI>Si&s;era</HI> into the hand of a <HI>Woman!</HI></NOTE>.
&mdash;What he is to gain by the change, or
the quotation, I cannot perceive, as the
&s;ame I&s;t Query &s;till recurs, &startq;Is it true
that the Scriptures are in reality &s;o differ|rently
interpreted in points of real con&s;equence?&endq;
In an&s;wer to which, the
<HI>Archdeacon of Oxford,</HI> we are told, <HI>has
<PB N="31" REF="33">
&s;hewn that points of real con&s;equence are
differently interpreted,</HI> and <HI>the plaine&s;t
texts explained away,</HI> and has <HI>in&s;tanced
&mdash;in the fir&s;t chapter of St. John's Go&s;pel.</HI>
&mdash;The plea we conceive is not much
indebted to the <HI>Archdeacon of Oxford.</HI>&mdash;But
be the&s;e Scriptures interpreted as they
will, each man has &s;till a right to inter|pret
them for him&s;elf. The Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> who always pu&s;hed her conclu&s;ions
with a courage and con&s;i&s;tency unknown
to the timid patrons of Prote&s;tant Impo|&s;ition,
&s;aw immediately that as the Laity
had no right to interpret the Scriptures,
they could have no occa&s;ion to read them,
and therefore very properly locked them
up from the intru&s;ion of popular curi|o&s;ity.
Our Author cites the abovemen|tioned
Query from the Con&s;iderations as
the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Query which would lead his
Reader to expect a <HI>&s;econd.</HI> The Reader,
however, may &s;eek that <HI>&s;econd</HI> for him|&s;elf,
the An&s;werer is not obliged to pro|duce
it&mdash;It &s;tands thus. Suppo&s;e the
Scriptures thus variou&s;ly interpreted, does
Sub&s;cription mend the matter?&mdash;The
<PB N="32" REF="34">
Reader too is left to find an an&s;wer for
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The next, the &s;tronge&s;t, the only tole|rable
plea for Sub&s;cription is, <HI>that all
&s;orts of pe&s;tilent here&s;ies might be taught
from the pulpit, if no &s;uch re&s;traint as
this was laid upon the Preacher</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Page 26.</NOTE>. How
far it is probable that this would be the
con&s;equence of removing Sub&s;cription,
and by what other means it might be
guarded again&s;t, has been hinted already,
and will again be con&s;idered in another
place. We will here only take notice of
one particular expedient &s;ugge&s;ted in the
Con&s;iderations, and which has often in|deed
el&s;ewhere been propo&s;ed, namely,
&startq;that the Church, in&s;tead of requiring
Sub&s;cription before-hand to the pre&s;ent,
or to any other Articles of faith, might
cen&s;ure her Clergy afterwards, if they
oppo&s;ed or vilified them in their preach|ing.&endq;
&mdash;The advantage of which &s;cheme
above the pre&s;ent is manife&s;t, if it was
only for this rea&s;on, that you di&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="35">
and corrupt thou&s;ands now, for one that
you would ever have occa&s;ion to puni&s;h.
Our Author neverthele&s;s <HI>is humbly of
opinion that it is much better to take proper
precautions beforehand:</HI> he mu&s;t, with all
his <HI>humility,</HI> know that when it has been
propo&s;ed to take proper precautions of
the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> by &s;ubjecting authors to an
<HI>imprimatur before</HI> publication, in&s;tead of
puni&s;hment <HI>after</HI> it; the propo&s;al has
been re&s;ented as an open attack upon the
rights and intere&s;ts of mankind. The
common &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the nation
could, &s;ee and feel this di&s;tinction, and
the importance of it, in the ca&s;e of pub|li&s;her&s;;
and why preachers &s;hould be
left in a wor&s;e &s;ituation it is not very
ea&s;y to &s;ay?</P>
<P>The example of the <HI>Arminian</HI> con|fe&s;&s;ion
is, upon this occa&s;ion, recom|mended
by the Author of the Con&s;idera|tions;
a confe&s;&s;ion which was compiled
for the edification and in&s;truction of the
members of that church, without pe|remptorily
in&s;i&s;ting upon any one's <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="36">
to it. But it is the misfortune of the
<HI>Arminian</HI> to be no national church&mdash;the
misfortune, alas! of Chri&s;tianity her|&s;elf
in her pure&s;t period; when &s;he was
under the government of the Apo&s;tles;
without <HI>alliance</HI> with the &s;tates of this
world; when &s;he compo&s;ed neverthele&s;s
a church as real, we conceive, and as
re&s;pectable, as any <HI>national</HI> church that
has exi&s;ted &s;ince.</P>
<P>Our Author, who can much &s;ooner
make a di&s;tinction than &s;ee one, does
not comprehend, it &s;eems, any diffe|rence
between Con$e&s;&s;ions of faith and
<HI>preaching,</HI> as to the u&s;e of un&s;criptural
terms. Did a Preacher, when he had
fini&s;hed his &s;ermon, call upon his con|gregation
to &s;ub&s;cribe their names and
a&s;&s;ent to it, or never to come more with|in
the doors of his church; there would
indeed be &s;ome fort of re&s;emblance
betwixt the two ca&s;es; but as the hearers
are at liberty to believe their preacher or
no, as they &s;ee, or he produces rea&s;ons,
for what he &s;ays; there can be no harm,
<PB N="35" REF="37">
and there is a manife&s;t utility, in tru&s;t|ing
him with the liberty of explaining
his own meaning in his own terms.</P>
<P>We now come, and with the tendere&s;t
regret, to the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who conti|nue
in the Church without being able to
reconcile to their belief every propo&s;ition
impo&s;ed upon them by Sub&s;cription;
over whole di&s;tre&s;s our Author is plea&s;ed
to indulge a wanton and ungenerous
triumph. They had pre&s;umed, it &s;eems,
that it was &s;ome apology for their con|duct,
that they &s;incerely laboured to
render to religion their be&s;t &s;ervices, and
thought their pre&s;ent &s;tations the faire&s;t
opportunities of performing it.&mdash;This
may not, perhaps, amount to a com|plete
vindication; it certainly does not
fully &s;atisfy even their own &s;cruples; el&s;e
where would be the cau&s;e of complaint?

thinks might be the con&s;equence, if all
were at once to withdraw them&s;elves

with her doctrines? Might not the
Church lo&s;e, what &s;he can ill &s;pare, the
&s;ervice of many able and indu&s;trious

by mixing with the crowd, in
the mo&s;t eager of their pur&s;uits after plea|&s;ure
or advantage?&mdash;One word with the
An&s;werer before we part upon this head.
&mdash;Whence all this great inqui&s;itivene&s;s,
this &s;olicitude to be acquainted with the
per&s;on, the opinions, and a&s;&s;ociates of

his adver&s;ary? Whence that impertinent

particular with regard to the doctrine of
the Trinity?</HI> Is it out of a pious de&s;ire
to fa&s;ten &s;ome here&s;y, or the imputation
of it, upon him? Is he <HI>called out of the
Clouds</HI> to be committed to the Flames<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We were unwilling to decline the defence of the per&s;ons here de&s;cribed, though the expre&s;&s;ion in the Con&s;iderations which brought on the attack, manife&s;tly related to a different &s;ubject.

But the An&s;werer, taking it for granted, that <HI>mini&s;terially complying</HI> meant the <HI>com|pliance of mini&s;ters,</HI> i. e. of clergymen officiating in their Functions, has, by a quibbk, or a blunder, transferred the pa&s;&s;age to a &s;en&s;e for which it was not intended.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>The 40th page of the An&s;wer intro|duces
a paragraph of con&s;iderable length,
the &s;um however and &s;ub&s;tance of which
is this&mdash;that if Sub&s;cription to Articles
<PB N="38" REF="40">
of faith were removed, confu&s;ion would
en&s;ue; the people would be di&s;tracted
with the di&s;putes of their teachers, and
the pulpits filled with controver&s;y and
contradiction.&mdash;Upon this <HI>Fact</HI> we join
i&s;&s;ue, and the more readily as this is a
&s;ort of rea&s;oning we all under&s;tand.&mdash;The
extent of the Legi&s;lator's right may
be an ab&s;tru&s;e enquiry, but whether a
Law does more good or harm, is a plain
que&s;tion which every man can a&s;k. Now,
that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing many of the Clergy, and
corrupting others;&mdash;that keeping out of
Churches, good Chri&s;tians and faithful
citizens;&mdash;that making parties in the
State, by giving occa&s;ion to Sects and
&s;eparations in Religion;&mdash;that the&s;e are
inconveniences, no man in his &s;en&s;es will
deny. The que&s;tion therefore is, What
advantage do you find in the oppo&s;ite
&s;cale to balance the&s;e inconveniencies?
The &s;imple advantage pretended is, that
you hereby prevent <HI>wrangling</HI> and con|tention
in the Pulpit. Now, in the fir&s;t
place, I ob&s;erve that allowing this evil to
be as grievous and as certain as you
<PB N="39" REF="41">
plea&s;e, the mo&s;t that can be nece&s;&s;ary for
the prevention of it is, to enjoin your
Preachers as to &s;uch points Silence and
Neutrality. In the next place, I am
convinced, that the danger is greatly
magnified. We hear little of the&s;e points
at pre&s;ent in our Churches and public
teaching, and it is not probable that
leaving them at large would elevate them
into more importance, or make it more
worth mens' while to quarrel about them.
&mdash;They would &s;leep in the &s;ame grave
with many other que&s;tions, of equal im|portance
with them&s;elves, or &s;ink back
into their proper place, into topics of
&s;peculation, or matters of debate from
the Pre&s;s. None but men of &s;ome Re|flection
would be forward to engage in
&s;uch &s;ubjects, and the lea&s;t reflection
would teach a man that <HI>Preaching</HI> is not
the proper vehicle of Controver&s;y:&mdash;Even
at pre&s;ent, &s;ays our Author, <HI>we
&s;peak and write what we pleea&s;e with im|punity;</HI>
and where is the mi&s;chief? or
what wor&s;e could en&s;ue if Sub&s;cription
were removed?&mdash;Nor can I di&s;cover
<PB N="40" REF="42">
any thing in the di&s;po&s;ition of the pe|titioning
Clergy that need alarm our
apprehen&s;ions. If they are impatient
under the Yoke, it is not from a de&s;ire to
hold forth their opinions to their congre|gations,
but that they may be at liberty to
entertain them them&s;elves without offence
to their con&s;ciences, or ruin to their for|tunes.</P>
<P>Our Author has added, by way of
<HI>make-weight,</HI> to his argument, <HI>that many
common Chri&s;tians, he believes, would be
greatly &s;candalized if you take away their
Creeds and Catechi&s;ms, and &s;trike out of
the Liturgy &s;uch things as they have
always e&s;teemed e&s;&s;ential</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 42-41.</NOTE>. Whatever
rea&s;on there may be for this <HI>belief</HI> at
pre&s;ent, there certainly was much greater
at the Reformation, as the Popi&s;h ritual
which was then <HI>taken away,</HI> had a fa&s;ci|nation
and antiquity which ours cannot
pretend to. Many were probably <HI>&s;canda|lized</HI>
at parting with their Beads and their
Ma&s;s-Books, that lived afterwards to
<PB N="41" REF="43">
thank tho&s;e who taught them better
things. Reflection we hope in &s;ome,
and Time we are &s;ure in all, will recon|cile
men to alterations e&s;tabli&s;hed in
rea&s;on. If there be any danger, it is
from &s;ome of the Clergy, who with the
An&s;werer would rather &s;uffer the <HI>vine|yard</HI>
to be overgrown with <HI>weeds,</HI> than
<HI>&s;tir the ground,</HI> or what is wor&s;e, call
the&s;e weeds <HI>the faire&s;t flowers in the
garden.</HI> Such might be ready enough to
rai&s;e a hue and cry again&s;t all innovators
in religion, as <HI>overturners of churches</HI>
and &s;poilers of temples.</P>
<P>But the cau&s;e, which of all others &s;tood
mo&s;t in the way of the late petitions for
relief, was an apprehen&s;ion that religious
in&s;titutions cannot be di&s;turbed without
awakening animo&s;ities and di&s;&s;entions in
the &s;tate, of which no man knows the
con&s;equence. Touch but Religion, we
are told, and it bur&s;ts forth into a flame.
Civil di&s;tractions may be compo&s;ed by
fortitude and per&s;everance, but neither
Rea&s;on nor Authority can controll, there
<PB N="42" REF="44">
is neither charm nor drug, which will
a&s;&s;wage, the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind when
called forth in the cau&s;e, and to the battles
of Religion. We were concerned to hear
this language from <HI>&s;ome</HI> who in other
in&s;tances have manife&s;ted a con&s;tancy and
re&s;olution which no confu&s;ion, nor ill
a&s;pect of public affairs could intimidate.
&mdash;After all, is there any real foundation
for the&s;e terrors? Is not this whole
danger like the Lion of the &s;lothful, the
creature of our fears, and the excu&s;e of
indolence? Was it propo&s;ed to <HI>make</HI>
articles, in&s;tead of <HI>removing</HI> them, there
would be room for the objection. But
it is obvious that Sub&s;cription to the 39
Articles might be altered or withdrawn,
upon general principles of ju&s;tice and
expediency, without reviving one re|ligious
controversy; or calling into di&s;|pute
a &s;ingle propo&s;ition they contain.
Who &s;hould excite di&s;turbances?&mdash;Tho&s;e
who are relieved, will not: and unle&s;s
Sub&s;cription were like a tax which being
taken from one, mu&s;t be laid with ad|ditional
weight upon another, is it pro|bable
<PB N="43" REF="45">
that any will complain that they
are oppre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e their brethren are
relieved? or that tho&s;e who are &s;o <HI>&s;trong
in the faith</HI> will refu&s;e to <HI>bear with the
infirmities of the weak?</HI> The few who
upon principles of this &s;ort oppo&s;ed the
application of the Di&s;&s;enters, were re|pul&s;ed
from Parliament with di&s;dain,
even by tho&s;e who were no friends to
the application it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion concerning the object
of wor&s;hip is attended I confe&s;s with dif|ficulty:
It &s;eems almo&s;t directly to divide
the Wor&s;hippers. But let the Church
pare down her excre&s;cencies till &s;he comes
to this Que&s;tion; let her di&s;charge from
her Liturgy Controver&s;ies unconnected
with devotion; let her try what may be
done for all &s;ides by wor&s;hipping God in
that generality<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">If a Chri&s;tian can think it an intolerable thing to wor&s;hip one God through one Mediator <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in company with any &s;uch as differ from him in their notions about the metaphy&s;ical nature of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> or the like; I am &s;orry for it.

&s;everal an&s;wers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In his la&s;t note our Author breaks forth into <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment</HI> and indignation, at the <HI>folly, inju&s;tice and indecency</HI> of comparing oar Church to the Jewi&s;h in our Saviour's time, and even to the <HI>Tower of Babel.</HI> Mi&s;taking the Church, in this la&s;t com|pari&s;on, for one of her <HI>Monuments</HI> (which, indeed, with mo&s;t people of his complexion, &s;tands for the &s;ame thing) erected to prevent our di&s;per&s;ion from that grand centre of catholic dominion; or in the words of a late celebrated Ca&s;tle-builder, <HI>to keep us together.</HI> If there be any <HI>indecency</HI> in &s;uch a compari&s;on, it mu&s;t be chargeable on tho&s;e who lead us to it, by making u&s;e of the &s;ame terms with the original Architects, and to which the Author of the Con&s;iderations evidently alludes.

<PB N="47" REF="49">
to the objections again&s;t the pre&s;ent mode
of Sub&s;cription, it now remains, by way
of &s;umming up the evidence, to bring
<HI>forward</HI> certain other Arguments con|tained
in the Con&s;iderations, to which
no an&s;wer has been attempted. It is
contended then,
<Q><P>I. That &s;tating any doctrine in a Con|fe&s;&s;ion
of Faith with a greater degree
of <HI>preci&s;ion</HI> than the Scriptures have
done, is in effect to &s;ay, that the
Scriptures have not &s;tated it with <HI>pre|ci&s;ion</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="50">
enough; in other words, that
the Scriptures are not &s;ufficient.&mdash;<HI>Mere
declamation.</HI></P>
<P>II. That this experiment of leaving men
at liberty, and points of doctrine at
large, has been attended with the im|provement
of religious knowledge,
where and whenever it has been tried.
And to this cau&s;e, &s;o far as we can &s;ee,
is owing the advantage which Pro|te&s;tant
countries in this re&s;pect po&s;&s;e&s;s
above their popi&s;h neighbours.&mdash;<HI>No
An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>III. That keeping people out of churches,
who might be admitted, con&s;i&s;tently
with every end of public wor&s;hip, and
excluding men from communion who
de&s;ire to embrace it, upon the terms
that God pre&s;cribes, is certainly not
encouraging, but rather cau&s;ing men
to <HI>for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves
together.&mdash;No An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">
IV. That men are deterred from &s;earch|ing
the Scriptures, by the fear of find|ing
there more or le&s;s than they looked
for; that is, &s;omething incon&s;i&s;tent
with what they have already given
their a&s;&s;ent to, and mu&s;t, at their
peril abide by.&mdash;<HI>No An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>V. That it is not giving Truth a fair
chance to decide points at one certain
time, and by one &s;et of men, which
had much better be left to the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
enquiries of different ages and
different per&s;ons;&mdash;<HI>No An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>VI. That it tends to multiply infidels
among&s;t us, by exhibiting Chri&s;tianity
under a form, and in a &s;y&s;tem which
many are di&s;gu&s;ted with, who yet will
not be at the pains to enquire after
any other.&mdash;<HI>No An&s;wer.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of his pamphlet
our Author is plea&s;ed to acknowledge,

Articles and Liturgy which he &s;hould be

with which redre&s;s has been pur&s;ued,

leave with them this ob&s;ervation, that
as the Man who attacks a flouri&s;hing

his neck, few ever will be found to
attempt alterations but men of more
&s;pirit than prudence, of more &s;incerity

tempers; that, con&s;equently, if
we are to wait for Improvement till the

begin it, 'till Church Governors
&s;olicit, or Mini&s;ters of State propo&s;e it
