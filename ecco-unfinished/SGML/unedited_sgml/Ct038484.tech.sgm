<PB REF="2">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IF an apology for the publication of the&s;e
Letters be thought as nece&s;&s;ary by the
readers as it is by the author, he has only
to &s;ay, and, however hackneyed &s;uch ex|cu&s;e
may be con&s;idered, he can &s;ay it with
great truth, that his appearance in print
is more owing to the &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;ome
partial friends, than to his own intentions.</P>
<P>The author arrived on the American
continent in the year 1769, and &s;ettled at
Annapolis, under the patronage and protec|tion
of the then governor of Maryland:
from his &s;ituation there, he became inti|mately
acquainted with the leading charac|ters
of every party in that province, and
with every event which occurred &s;ub&s;e|quent
to his own arrival, until the unfor|tunate
<PB REF="3">
mi&s;under&s;tanding, which aro&s;e be|tween
the parent &s;tate and the colonies,
rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for every one, like
him &s;incerely and &s;teadily attached to the
former, to continue in the country.</P>
<P>What he &s;aw and ob&s;erved from the fir&s;t
period of his re&s;idence there, he occa&s;ionally
communicated to his friends in England;
and as he had the opportunity of &s;eeing,
and ob&s;erving much, it has been conceived
by &s;ome re&s;pectable characters, for who&s;e
judgment he has the greate&s;t deference, that
the corre&s;pondence originally intended for
private amu&s;ement only, contained matter
&s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to engage the atten|tion
of the public.</P>
<P>The former part of the&s;e letters will
be found to give a de&s;cription of the coun|try,
government, trade, manners, and cu&s;|toms
of the inhabitants; the latter, the
<PB REF="4">
ri&s;e and gradual progre&s;s of the civil di&s;|&s;ention,
which is not perhaps &s;o well
known, at lea&s;t &s;o far as the province of
Maryland was concerned, as are the con|&s;equences
which attended it.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion will not, it is hoped, be
thought the lea&s;t intere&s;ting part of the
work, as it repre&s;ents the difficulties and
dangers to which the author was expo&s;ed,
from his loyalty, and un&s;haken attachment,
to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>York Town, Virginia, <DATE>Aug. 30th, 1769.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM, my dear friend, at length &s;afely
landed on the American continent.
Our voyage has been tedious; we have en|countered
hard gales, and contrary winds;
but of the&s;e I think no more. I am now
become an inhabitant of a new world; and
I enter into it, not only with the common
feelings of a &s;tranger, who&s;e attention is
engaged by the novelty of every &s;urround|ing
<PB N="2" REF="50">
object, but with the more intere&s;ting
reflexion, that this country is not more new
to me than are my hopes and expectations
in it; and that I am here, under the pa|tronage
of new friends, to engage in new
pur&s;uits. With this impre&s;&s;ion, I cannot
but form an ideal connexion between what
I &s;ee, and what I feel. I mean not, how|ever,
that this &s;hould at all influence the
narrative which I &s;hall occa&s;ionally tran&s;|mit
to you; <HI>that,</HI> as far as is in my
power, &s;hall contain no more than what
may be &s;uppo&s;ed naturally to &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf
to any indifferent &s;pectator, whom curio&s;ity
or amu&s;ement has carried into a di&s;tant
country.</P>
<P>I will begin with acquainting you, that
the &s;ituation of this town is exqui&s;itely
beautiful, and the adjacent country very
romantic and picture&s;que. The noble
river Che&s;apeak is full in view, which,
<PB N="3" REF="51">
in the narrowe&s;t part, is at lea&s;t ten miles
broad, and runs a cour&s;e of near three
hundred, navigable for the large&s;t &s;hips.
Many con&s;iderable rivers di&s;charge them|&s;elves
into this bay, by which the ad|vantages
of commerce are extended to the
interior country; and planters who&s;e ha|bitations
are far remote from the ocean,
receive at their own doors, by water con|veyance,
the various productions of di&s;|tant
nations.</P>
<P>From hence to Annapolis, the de&s;|tined
&s;cene of my future pur&s;uits, is two
hundred miles; for which place I &s;hall
embark on board a &s;chooner, the in&s;tant
I receive my baggage, and hope &s;peedily
to impart the particulars of a mo&s;t fa|vourable
reception.</P>

Che&s;apeak Bay, <DATE>Sept. 1&s;t.</DATE></P>
<P>YESTERDAY I made an excur&s;ion to
William&s;burgh, the metropolis of Vir|ginia,
the &s;ituation of which is by no
means equal to York Town. The capi|tal
where the delegates of the people
a&s;&s;emble, is neat and elegant; the college
and the governor's palace, are likewi&s;e
hand&s;ome edifices; but I did not di&s;tin|gui&s;h
any other buildings which particu|larly
merited ob&s;ervation. I was, how|ever,
greatly entertained by the variegated
beautiful pro&s;pects, lofty woods, and highly
cultivated plantations, which pre&s;ented
them&s;elves to me in every direction.</P>
<P>I am now on my pa&s;&s;age for Anna|polis;
a gentle breeze wafts us plea&s;antly
on our cour&s;e; the day is &s;plendid, and
the intere&s;ting and magnificent objects
which continually &s;trike the eye, infinitely
exceed the utmo&s;t powers of de&s;cription.
<PB N="5" REF="53">
Innumerable ve&s;&s;els of different denomina|tions
are floating in every point of view,
which add to the grandeur of the &s;cene,
and impre&s;s the mind with agreeable ideas
of commercial advantages.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e we are &s;teering is nearly
&s;outh; we have pa&s;&s;ed many noble rivers
on both &s;ides the bay, particularly the Po|tomac,
on the we&s;tern &s;hore; which, at
the entrance, is &s;everal miles in breadth,
and is navigable for &s;hips of great burthen
to Alexandria, about forty leagues from
its influx. At a &s;mall di&s;tance above that
place are &s;ome con&s;iderable falls, which
interrupt the navigation of ve&s;&s;els further
up the country; but I am informed that a
plan is in agitation to remove this ob&s;truc|tion;
and &s;hould &s;ucce&s;s attend the execu|tion,
it is &s;carcely conceivable to what an
immen&s;e di&s;tance commerce may be then
extended.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="54">
The Potomac &s;eparates Virginia from
Maryland; but there are countries belong|ing
to each province on both &s;ides the bay.
In the Maryland government, the divi|&s;ion
is nearly equal; but in that of Virginia,
their territory on the we&s;tern &s;hore is in|finitely
more exten&s;ive, more populous,
and more important than on the ea&s;tern.</P>
<P>The&s;e immen&s;e waters are diver&s;ified
with an infinite number of i&s;lands of the
mo&s;t varied and beautiful appearance.
Some are cultivated; others entirely co|vered
with lofty, valuable timber. It is
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, on viewing the natural
advantages of this country, to avoid antici|pating
the future political and commercial
importance of America.</P>
<P>A few weeks &s;ince, the Thames was the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable river I had ever beheld;
it is now, comparatively, reduced to a di|minutive
<PB N="7" REF="55">
&s;tream: but, may its real im|portance
increa&s;e to the end of time!&mdash;
May the wealth of all nations flow in with
every tide, to the encouragement of arts
and manufactures, and to the general ad|vancement
of the riches and pro&s;perity of
Britain!</P>
<P>Early to-morrow, I hope to land at An|napolis.
The cliffs which bound the en|trance
of the Severn, are now in view;
but the wind is too light, and the di&s;tance
too remote to permit us to entertain a hope
of reaching the harbour before morning.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sept. 4th.</DATE></P>
<P>EARLY ye&s;terday I was &s;afely landed
at my de&s;ired port. The ma&s;ter of the
&s;chooner conducted me to a tavern, where,
after a &s;light repa&s;t, I made the nece&s;&s;ary
preparations to appear before the Gover|nor.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="56">
My reception was equal to my warme&s;t
wi&s;hes. The deportment of Governor
Eden was open and friendly. He invited
me to meet a party at dinner, and I took
leave, till the appointed hour, with a heart
replete with joy and gratitude.</P>
<P>Under&s;tanding that I was in time for
divine &s;ervice, I availed my&s;elf of an im|mediate
opportunity to offer up my &s;ervent
acknowledgements at the throne of grace;
and to entreat Heaven to di&s;pen&s;e ble&s;&s;ings
on tho&s;e with whom my fate is in&s;eparably
connected.</P>
<P>The exterior appearance of the church
has little to recommend it, but the con|gregation
was numerous. The &s;olemn of|fices
were performed with a becoming
devotion; and my mind was perfectly in
uni&s;on with the important duties of the
day.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="57">
On my return to the Governor, he in|troduced
me, in the mo&s;t obliging terms,
to &s;everal per&s;ons of the highe&s;t re&s;pecta|bility
in the province. He treated me
with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s and cordiality;
a&s;&s;ured me of his &s;tronge&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to
advance my future pro&s;perity, and gave
me an unlimited invitation to his ho&s;pita|ble

<P>I could not but con&s;ider the&s;e circum|&s;tances
of my reception and introduc|tion,
as a prelude to future advantages.
The plea&s;ing tran&s;actions of the day ex|hilarated
my &s;pirits; I evidently per|ceived
a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my behalf; I ex|erted
my utmo&s;t to improve the favour|able

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Oct. 1&s;t, 1769.</DATE></P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the receipt of your
letter, the painful information had
arrived, that Powell was no more! He
was the valued friend of my early youth,
and I &s;hall ever cheri&s;h his remembrance
with unabated attachment. To men|tion
his profe&s;&s;ional excellence is unne|ce&s;&s;ary;
the unanimous voice of the pub|lic
having firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;uperior
preten&s;ions. Nor need I expre&s;s my fears,
that it is improbable we &s;hall quickly
&startq;look upon his like again;&endq; for how &s;el|dom
is it that the great requi&s;ites of acting
are &s;o united in one man, as they were in
him! Great, however, as his lo&s;s is to
the public, it is &s;till greater to his friends;
<PB N="12" REF="60">
to the&s;e who knew, as we did, his mild
and amiable manners; his ea&s;y and unaf|fected
vivacity; and his uniform candour
and benevolence. My feelings on hearing
of his death, were much augmented by the
particulars of a circum&s;tance immediately
preceding it: After having contended &s;e|veral
days with the violence of his di&s;order,
nature appeared totally exhau&s;ted, and he
had lain, for a con&s;iderable time, with
&s;carce a &s;ymptom of exi&s;tence. His &s;ur|rounding
friends had mournfully yielded
him to his fate; and were expecting each
moment the la&s;t convul&s;ive exertion! when
&s;uddenly &s;tarting, with wonderful expre&s;|&s;ion
in his countenance, he repeated the
&s;peech in Macbeth, commencing with the
words: &startq;Is this a dagger&mdash;&endq; tracing
with his eye the imaginary movement of
the delu&s;ive phantom; then a &s;hort period
of recollection took place&mdash;he appeared
con&s;cious of having been under the influ|ence
<PB N="13" REF="61">
of a delirium&mdash;invoked Heaven for
mercy, and &s;unk lifele&s;s on his pillow!
What a &s;trong in&s;tance of the ruling pa&s;|&s;ion,
in his final exit! In him I have lo&s;t
a faithful, animated friend; and &startq;friends
grow not thick on every bough.&endq; But
no more of this&mdash;I will endeavour to re|lieve
my mind from the intru&s;ion of me|lancholy
ideas, by attempting to gratify
your curio&s;ity re&s;pecting this place, and its
environs.</P>
<P>Annapolis is nearly encompa&s;&s;ed by the
river Severn, and, with every advantage
of &s;ituation, is built on a very irregular
plan. The adjacent country pre&s;ents a va|riety
of beautiful pro&s;pects, agreeably diver|&s;ified
with well &s;ettled plantations, lofty
woods, and navigable waters. In our lit|tle
metropolis, the public buildings do not
impre&s;s the mind with any idea of magni|ficence,
having been chiefly erected during
<PB N="14" REF="62">
the infancy of the colony, when conve|nience
was the directing principle, with|out
attention to the embelli&s;hment of art.</P>
<P>The court-hou&s;e, &s;ituated on an emi|nence
at the back of the town, commands
a variety of views highly intere&s;ting; the
entrance of the Severn, the maje&s;tic Che|&s;apeak,
and the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Maryland,
being all united in one re&s;plendent a&s;&s;em|blage.
Ve&s;&s;els of various &s;izes and figures
are continually floating before the eye;
which, while they add to the beauty of
the &s;cene, excite ideas of the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing
nature.</P>
<P>In the court-hou&s;e, the repre&s;entatives
of the people a&s;&s;emble, for the di&s;patch
of provincial bu&s;ine&s;s. The courts of ju&s;|tice
are al&s;o held here; and here, like|wi&s;e,
the public offices are e&s;tabli&s;hed.
This building has nothing in its appearance
<PB N="15" REF="63">
expre&s;&s;ive of the great purpo&s;es to which
it is appropriated; and by a &s;trange neglect,
is &s;uffered to fall continually into decay;
being, both without and within, an em|blem
of public poverty, and at the &s;ame
time a &s;evere reflection on the government
of this country, which, it &s;eems, is con|&s;iderably
richer than the generality of the
American provinces.</P>
<P>The council chamber is a detached
building, adjacent to the former, on a very
humble &s;cale. It contains one tolerable
room, for the reception of the governor
and his council, who meet here during the
&s;itting of the a&s;&s;embly; and who&s;e con|currence
is nece&s;&s;ary in pa&s;&s;ing all laws.</P>
<P>I am not yet enabled, from my own ob|&s;ervation,
to form any accurate judgment
re&s;pecting the political di&s;po&s;ition of the
coloni&s;ts; but, if the information I have
<PB N="16" REF="64">
received may be relied on, they attend with
a jealous eye to the conduct of their re|&s;pective
governors; and to every regula|tion
in the parent &s;tate, which relates to
their external or internal intere&s;ts. In
the northern provinces, a republican &s;pirit
evidently prevails; and in the middle and
&s;outhern, they are, perhaps, too ready in
taking the alarm, whenever they conceive
any mea&s;ures are in agitation which may
le&s;&s;en their importance, embarra&s;s their
trade, or render them more dependent on
the mother country. Almo&s;t from the
commencement of their &s;ettlements, they
have occa&s;ionally combated again&s;t real, or
&s;uppo&s;ed innovations; and I am per&s;uaded,
whenever they become populous, in pro|portion
to the extent of their territory,
they cannot be retained as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,
otherwi&s;e than by inclination and intere&s;t.
But I am wandering into a wide, unplea&s;|ing
field of political di&s;qui&s;ition, in&s;tead
<PB N="17" REF="65">
of pur&s;uing the more agreeable path of
de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The governor's hou&s;e is mo&s;t beautifully
&s;ituated, and when the nece&s;&s;ary alterations
are completed, it will be a regular, conve|nient,
and elegant building. The garden
is not exten&s;ive, but it is di&s;po&s;ed to the
utmo&s;t advantage; the centre walk is ter|minated
by a &s;mall green mount, clo&s;e to
which the Severn approaches; this eleva|tion
commands an exten&s;ive view of the
bay, and the adjacent country. The &s;ame
objects appear to equal advantage from the
&s;aloon, and many apartments in the hou&s;e;
and perhaps I may be ju&s;tified in a&s;&s;erting,
that there are but few man&s;ions in the mo&s;t
rich and cultivated parts of England, which
are adorned with &s;uch &s;plendid and roman|tic
&s;cenery.</P>
<P>The buildings in Annapolis were for|merly
of &s;mall dimen&s;ions, and of an in|elegant
<PB N="18" REF="66">
con&s;truction; but there are now
&s;everal modern edifices which make a good
appearance. There are few habitations
without gardens; &s;ome of which are
planted in a decent &s;tile, and are well
&s;tocked.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, this city has more the ap|pearance
of an agreeable village, than the
metropolis of an opulent province, as it
contains within its limits a number of &s;mall
fields, which are intended for future erec|tions.
But in a few years, it will probably
be one of the be&s;t built cities in America,
as a &s;pirit of improvement is predominant,
and the &s;ituation is allowed to be equally
healthy and plea&s;ant with any on this &s;ide
the Atlantic.</P>
<P>There is not, however, any probability
that Annapolis will ever attain any im|portance
in a commercial point of view:
<PB N="19" REF="67">
the harbour is not capable of containing
many ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burthen; and
the hazard of being frozen up, for a long
period, during winter, is a powerful ob&s;ta|cle
to mercantile purpo&s;es. It is, however,
the &s;eat of Government; the public offices
are here e&s;tabli&s;hed; and as many of the
principal families have cho&s;en this place
for their re&s;idence, there are few towns, of
the &s;ame &s;ize, in any part of the Briti&s;h
dominions, that can boa&s;t a more poli&s;hed
&s;ociety.</P>
<P>You cannot travel any con&s;iderable di&s;|tance
in this country, without cro&s;&s;ing ri|vers,
many of them wider than the Thames
at Woolwich. Over the&s;e, regular ferries
are e&s;tabli&s;hed, at the charge of the re&s;pec|tive
counties; but though every proper
method is adopted for expedition, yet &s;uch
a number of con&s;iderable waters unavoida|bly
occa&s;ion great delay.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="68">
In the vicinity of Annapolis are many
plea&s;ant villas, who&s;e proprietors are emi|nent
for their ho&s;pitality. Colonel Sharp,
the late Governor, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a mo&s;t de|lightful
retirement, about &s;even miles di&s;|tant;
his hou&s;e is on a large &s;cale, the
de&s;ign is excellent, and the apartments
well fitted up, and perfectly convenient.
The adjacent grounds are &s;o judiciou&s;ly
di&s;po&s;ed, that utility and ta&s;te are every
where happily united; and when the wor|thy
owner has completed his exten&s;ive
plan, Whitehall will be one of the mo&s;t
de&s;irable &s;ituations in this, or in any of
the neighbouring provinces.</P>
<P>Colonel Sharp has re&s;ided many years in
this country, where he has e&s;tabli&s;hed a
reputation which reflects the highe&s;t ho|nour
on his public capacity, and on his
private virtues. This gentleman does not
&s;eem to entertain any idea of returning to
<PB N="21" REF="69">
his native land, but appears inclined to
&s;pend the re&s;idue of his days, within the
limits of a province, which he has &s;o long
governed with honour to him&s;elf, &s;atisfac|tion
to the people, and fidelity to his &s;o|vereign.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>October 19th.</DATE></P>
<P>I HAVE lately made an excur&s;ion to the
ea&s;tern &s;hore of this province. As the
narrative may po&s;&s;ibly afford you &s;ome
entertainment, I &s;hall here endeavour to
give you an account of the particulars of
our journey.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth in&s;tant, the gover|nor
and his lady, with a party of gentle|men,
among&s;t whom I had the honour to
be included, embarked on board a ve&s;&s;el
properly accommodated for our reception;
the weather was remarkably fine, and a
plea&s;ant gale wafted us, in about five hours,
to the &s;eat of Mr. C&mdash;.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="70">
This gentleman re&s;ides on an i&s;land in the
Che&s;apeak, about &s;even miles in length, and
of different breadth; the whole of which,
being his intire property, is well cultivated,
and produces great quantities of tobacco,
grain, cattle, and &s;tock of various kinds;
and as it abounds likewi&s;e with game, the
worthy proprietor lives, in a manner, inde|pendent
of mankind, the monarch of his
little fertile territory.</P>
<P>Early on the following morning, &s;eve|ral
of the neighbouring gentry vi&s;ited the
i&s;land, to pay their re&s;pects to the gover|nor,
and invitations poured in from every
quarter. We were, however, under the
nece&s;&s;ity of declining the&s;e proofs of atten|tion;
his Excellency being obliged, on the
&s;ixteenth, to attend &s;ome provincial con|cerns
in Annapolis. Accordingly, after
partaking of a &s;ub&s;tantial breakfa&s;t, in the
true American &s;tyle, which con&s;i&s;ted not
<PB N="23" REF="71">
only of tea, coffee, and the u&s;ual accompa|niments,
but likewi&s;e of ham, dried veni|&s;on,
beef, and other reli&s;hing articles, we
took leave of our friendly ho&s;t, ferried over
from his i&s;land to the main land, where car|riages
were waiting for our accommodation,
and proceeded about twenty miles along the
banks of the Che&s;apeak.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this little tour, we pa&s;|&s;ed
&s;everal plantations, which not only pro|claimed
the opulence, but the ta&s;te of their
owners. About noon, we arrived oppo&s;ite
Kent I&s;land, which, on that &s;ide, is only
divided by a narrow &s;tream from the main
land: we were quickly conveyed to the
oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and in a &s;hort time came to
the hou&s;e of Mr. H. where we enjoyed
a cheerful evening; and on the following
day embarked for the &s;eat of government.</P>
<P>Kent I&s;land is a narrow tract of land,
about twenty miles in length, fertile, and
<PB N="24" REF="72">
well &s;ettled; many of the inhabitants po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
not only the comforts, but the
elegancies of life. This delectable &s;pot
forms one pari&s;h, the clerical emoluments
of which afford a comfortable, if not an
affluent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the incumbent.
Kent I&s;land ranges along the Bay, at the
di&s;tance of about ten miles from the we&s;t|ern
&s;hore, and beautifully terminates a mo&s;t
delightful pro&s;pect, highly variegated with
wood and water.</P>
<P>As you cannot but be &s;olicitous concern|ing
my views and expectations, you will
be glad to learn that they are highly fa|vourable.
In England there are few, even
in great departments of the &s;tate, who po&s;|&s;e&s;s
&s;o exten&s;ive a patronage as the gover|nor
of Maryland; and I am perfectly a&s;|&s;ured,
that his inclination to promote my
intere&s;t is in full proportion to his abi|lity.
But public affairs do not, at this
<PB N="25" REF="73">
juncture, wear the mo&s;t flattering a&s;pect.
You, who know with what applau&s;e the
repeal of the &s;tamp act was received on
this &s;ide the Atlantic, will not be &s;urprized
to hear, that a revival of the claim of taxa|tion,
by laying duties on other articles, has
renewed the apprehen&s;ions and di&s;contents
which had happily &s;ub&s;ided: and the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of admiralty courts, during the
cour&s;e of the preceding year, appears to
have rai&s;ed a determined oppo&s;ition to the
proceedings of government. To know
where it will terminate is beyond the reach
of human penetration. A&s;&s;ociations are
forming from one extremity of this conti|nent
to the other; few appear to di&s;&s;ent
from the popular creed; and it &s;eems to be
generally admitted, that if the Americans
&s;teadily adhere to their non-importation
agreement, they will from the intere&s;t, if
not from the equity of the Parent State,
obtain redre&s;s of grievances. &startq;Stati&s;t I
<PB N="26" REF="74">
am none, nor like to be;&endq; therefore am by
no means competent to deliver my &s;enti|ments
on this very alarming &s;ubject. There
are &s;ome zealots, who are frantic enough
to affect a bold language, and to talk of
ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, if arguments and pacific
remon&s;trances &s;hould prove ineffectual; but
&s;uch men are de&s;ervedly treated with con|tempt
by the wi&s;e and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate. I am
per&s;uaded, the principal per&s;ons in every
government, are not inclined to adopt any
mea&s;ures but what are founded on rec|titude
and moderation, from a &s;ettled be|lief,
that calm and re&s;pectful applications
from the legi&s;lative body, will eventually
be productive of every de&s;ired con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But enough of politics. I am looking

<P>COLONEL F&mdash;, a gentleman of
con&s;iderable property, and a mem|ber
of the council, early in December,
engaged the governour, with a circle of
&s;elect friends, to pa&s;s a few days, during
the Chri&s;tmas vacation, at his &s;eat in Cal|vert

board a &s;chooner which he had fitted up
for occa&s;ional excur&s;ions; and con&s;idering
the &s;ea&s;on of the year, we had a plea&s;ant

Rou&s;by Hall, which is the name of my
friend's ho&s;pitable man&s;ion, is as well
known to the weary indigent traveller, as
to the affluent gue&s;t. In a country where
ho&s;pitality is the di&s;tingui&s;hing feature, the
benevolent owner has e&s;tabli&s;hed a pre|eminence,
which places his character in
an exalted point of view.</P>
<P>The governor, on account of &s;ome par|ticular
engagements, did not quit Anna|polis
till the twenty-&s;ixth; and on the
thirtieth I accompanied Colonel F&mdash;to
the habitation of a gentleman, about twen|ty
miles di&s;tant, where, by appointment,
we met his Excellency, with a numerous
party, who had a&s;&s;embled to bid him wel|come.
All the good things of a plentiful
country decorated the table of our muni|ficent
ho&s;t; the wines were excellent, and
various; and cheerful blazing fires, with
enlivening conver&s;ation, exhilarated the
<PB N="29" REF="77">
&s;pirits, and rendered us totally regardle&s;s
of the rigour of an American winter. On
the en&s;uing day, the whole company pro|ceeded
to Rou&s;by Hall, where we conti|nued,
in the full enjoyment of genuine
ho&s;pitality, till the third month; and it
was with the utmo&s;t reluctance we were
then permitted to take our departure.</P>
<P>Since we quitted Colonel F&mdash;, we
have vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the principal families
in Calvert, St. Mary's, Charles, Prince
George's, and Anne Arundel Counties; and
were every where received with the mo&s;t
obliging proofs of regard and attention.
From the &s;everity of the weather, we oc|ca&s;ionally
encountered &s;ome hard&s;hips and
inconveniences, but we were amply com|pen&s;ated
at the end of every &s;tage, by excel|lent
accommodations, and &s;umptuous fare.
Notwith&s;tanding the dreary &s;ea&s;on, the eye
was gratified with many picture&s;que and
noble objects: we travelled a con&s;iderable
<PB N="30" REF="78">
way on the banks of the great river Potow|mac,
which &s;eparates Maryland from Vir|ginia;
and though this country is greatly
inferior, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, to the highly
cultivated parts of South Britain, yet, on
the whole, it is well &s;ettled; the generality
of the plantations are di&s;po&s;ed with the ut|mo&s;t
regularity, and in very many of the
habitations we found elegance as well as
comfort.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed an agreeable evening with a
family, nearly oppo&s;ite to Alexandria in
Virginia; and, had the weather been mo|derate,
intended to have cro&s;&s;ed the river
on a vi&s;it to Major Wa&s;hington, who, as
you may recollect, particularly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
him&s;elf in the tran&s;actions of the late
war: this gentleman has a plea&s;ant &s;eat on
the banks of the Potowmac, in the vici|nity
of the above town, which is named
Mount Vernon, where he re&s;ides in full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of univer&s;al love, and e&s;teem.</P>

<P>ON Saturday la&s;t our little city appeared
in all its &s;plendor. It was the anniver|&s;ary
of the proprietary's birth. The go|vernor
gave a grand entertainment on the
occa&s;ion to a numerous party: the com|pany
brought with them every di&s;po&s;ition
to render each other happy; and the fe&s;|tivity
concluded with cards, and dancing,
which engaged the attention of their re|&s;pective
votaries till an early hour.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded there is not a town in
England of the &s;ame &s;ize as Annapolis,
which can boa&s;t a greater number of fa|&s;hionable
and hand&s;ome women; and were
I not &s;atisfied to the contrary, I &s;hould
&s;uppo&s;e that the majority of our belles po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
every advantage of a long and fami|liar

of your great metropolis.</P>
<P>I am told that beauty in this country is
not of long duration: it is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted
that, in general, the men do not po&s;&s;e&s;s
&s;uch good &s;tamina as the natives of Great
Britain. Though every way equal in ge|nius

able to &s;upport fatigue, and to encounter
the hard&s;hips of laborious employments.</P>
<P>During the winter there are a&s;&s;emblies
every fortnight; the room for dancing is
large; the con&s;truction elegant; and the
whole illuminated to great advantage. At
each extremity are apartments for the card
tables, where &s;elect companies enjoy the
circulation of the party-coloured gentry,
without having their attention diverted by
the &s;ound of fiddles, and the evolutions
of youthful performers.</P>

About Chri&s;tmas an inten&s;e fro&s;t &s;et in,

<P>It is certainly extraordinary, that in a

duration, a degree of cold to which
the northern extremities of the Briti&s;h
I&s;lands have never been accu&s;tomed: this,
I am informed, proceeds entirely from local
circum&s;tances; the winds, prevalent in
winter, blowing over tho&s;e immen&s;e lakes,
&s;ituated to the we&s;tward of this, and &s;ome
neighbouring provinces, impregnate the
air with frigid particles, that make us

<P>In this country a heavy &s;now generally

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the exten&s;ive fore&s;ts

<P>I THANK you, my friend, for your

happy, and promi&s;ing e&s;tabli&s;hment.
The &s;cene is, indeed, rever&s;ed; the remem|brance

to excite a grateful &s;en&s;ibility of that pro|vidential
goodne&s;s which has &s;afely con|ducted
me through a maze of difficulties
and embarra&s;&s;ments, re&s;tored me to all the

placed me in a &s;ituation that has
little to fear from a rever&s;e of fortune.</P>
<P>You have been rightly informed re&s;pect|ing
the conduct of our worthy governor.
From every ob&s;ervation I have, hitherto,
been enabled to make, he appears perfectly
<PB N="37" REF="85">
competent to the di&s;charge of his impor|tant
duty. Not only in the &s;ummer, but
during the extreme rigour of an Ameri|can
winter, it is his cu&s;tom to ri&s;e early:
till the hour of dinner he devotes the
whole of his time to provincial concerns;
the meane&s;t individual obtains an ea&s;y, and
immediate acce&s;s to his per&s;on; he inve&s;ti|gates,
with accuracy, the complicated duties
of his &s;tation; and di&s;covers, upon every oc|ca&s;ion,
alacrity in the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s;
and a perfect knowledge of the relative con|nexions
of the country.</P>
<P>Had he been appointed to &s;ucceed a
per&s;on who had con&s;ulted his private
advantage in preference to that of the
public; who had been found unequal to
the di&s;charge of his important tru&s;t, or
remi&s;s in the execution it would have re|quired
no extraordinary exertion of abi|lities
to have appeared in a favourable
<PB N="38" REF="86">
point of view. But his immediate prede|ce&s;&s;or,
by the invariable rectitude of his
conduct, the affability of his manners, and
his unremitting attention to the happine&s;s
and pro&s;perity of Maryland, had e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
a well merited popularity, which, du|ring
an admini&s;tration of &s;ixteen years,
continued in full force, and has &s;ecured to
him the unabated love, and attachment of
a grateful people.</P>
<P>That our pre&s;ent &s;upreme magi&s;trate po&s;|&s;&s;es
an exten&s;ive capacity for government,
is, indeed, obvious to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial
ob&s;erver; but it may be objected, that ex|perience
is yet wanting to confirm his
claim to eminent di&s;tinction. I admit the
force of the objection; and will likewi&s;e
acknowledge the influence of partiality.
He is my patron! my benefactor! I may
po&s;&s;ibly be animated by the impul&s;e of
gratitude, to delineate his conduct in the
<PB N="39" REF="87">
&s;tronge&s;t colours. To time I therefore
leave him, the only true criterion by
which any character can be properly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
To that inconte&s;tible deci&s;ion he
him&s;elf emphatically appeals in the conclu|&s;ion
of his fir&s;t &s;peech to the general a&s;|&s;embly
of the province. Let me quote a
declaration which, &s;hould he be found de|fective,
will &s;tand recorded to his di&s;ad|vantage,

</LETTER>
<P>Maryland is a proprietary government,
and owes its original &s;ettlement to religious
motives. In the year 1632, Lord Balti|more,
who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable in|fluence,
obtained a grant of this country
from Charles the Fir&s;t, until which time
it had been con&s;idered as a part of Virgi|nia
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The royal grant was given on this &s;ingular condi|tion, that the proprietary &s;hould annually pre&s;ent, at Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, two Indian arrows.</NOTE>. The Roman Catholics were, at
that period, greatly harra&s;&s;ed by the Puri|tans,
who were then beginning to become
the predominant party; and to &s;ecure
them an a&s;ylum, where they might &s;afely
<PB N="41" REF="89">
profe&s;s their religious tenets, was the mo|tive
which induced the above nobleman
to &s;olicit the grant. Accordingly, in the
following year, about two hundred fami|lies,
of that per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;ome of whom
were of con&s;iderable di&s;tinction, embarked
from Ireland for this newly acquired ter|ritory,
where they were favourably receiv|ed
by the Indian inhabitants, who&s;e affec|tion
they had the good fortune to conci|liate
by the liberality of their conduct; in|&s;omuch
that they were &s;oon enabled to pur|cha&s;e
exten&s;ive tracts on the mo&s;t moderate
terms, and to &s;ettle their lands to the be&s;t
advantage, without entertaining any anxi|ous
apprehen&s;ions from the original po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>During the exi&s;tence of that illegal
power, which had &s;ubverted the ancient
con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate, the
proprietor of Maryland was deprived of
<PB N="42" REF="90">
his authority and his property; and a go|vernor,
appointed by the protector, was
&s;ub&s;tituted in his &s;tead: but at the re&s;tora|tion
the property of the province reverted
to its natural po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; Lord Baltimore
was rein&s;tated in his privileges; and quick|ly
demon&s;trated, by his di&s;tingui&s;hed con|duct,
that he had every claim which me|rit
and ju&s;tice could afford. He in&s;tituted
a perfect toleration with re&s;pect to religion.
He gave the utmo&s;t encouragement to agri|culture
and to commerce. In con&s;equence
of his judicious exertions, the colony in|crea&s;ed
rapidly in wealth and population,
and per&s;ons of all denominations, attracted
by the moderation and equity of his go|vernment,
were emulous to obtain &s;et|lements
under &s;o flouri&s;hing and re&s;pec|table
an e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>At the demi&s;e of Charles the Second, a
weak, arbitrary, and tyrannical monarch
<PB N="43" REF="91">
&s;ucceeded to the throne; during who&s;e &s;hort,
but pernicious admini&s;tration, this noble
family were again deprived of their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
which had been derived from royal
bounty, and had been wonderfully improv|ed,
at the expence of infinite labour and
proportionable di&s;bur&s;ements. They were,
however, again rein&s;tated, in con&s;equence
of that glorious revolution which e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
the Briti&s;h con&s;titution on a firm unal|terable
ba&s;is.</P>
<P>Though, by this ever-memorable event,
the proprietor was re&s;tored to the profits
of the government, yet the right of go|verning
could not, con&s;i&s;tently, under the
new &s;y&s;tem, be conferred on a Roman Ca|tholic;
therefore, until the family renounc|ed
that communion, the crown a&s;&s;umed
the power of appointing the &s;upreme ma|gi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="92">
Lord Baltimore, the pre&s;ent proprietor,
has a right to exerci&s;e in his own per&s;on,
all the executive offices of government;
and in his ab&s;ence to nominate one to that
department, with the con&s;ent and appro|bation
of his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent governor, who married his
elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, was elevated to that &s;ituation,
a few months before my arrival in the
country.</P>
<P>Maryland is divided into fourteen coun|ties,
&s;even on the we&s;tern, and &s;even on
the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the bay, each of which
&s;ends four repre&s;entatives to the general a&s;|&s;embly.
The city of Annapolis has like|wi&s;e
the privilege of delegating two. The&s;e
gentlemen form the lower hou&s;e, and, if
I may compare &s;mall things to great,
po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;imilar powers with the commons
in the Briti&s;h parliament. The council, is
<PB N="45" REF="93">
compo&s;ed of ten members, who are nomi|nated
by the governor: they have the appel|lation
of honourable, and with them he is
to advi&s;e in all matters re&s;pecting the gene|ral
intere&s;ts of the community. During
the &s;itting of the a&s;&s;embly, they become a
&s;uperior branch of the legi&s;lature, and their
confirmation is e&s;&s;ential to the pa&s;&s;ing of
all laws.</P>
<P>The governor is, in every particular,
the repre&s;entative of the Crown. He ap|points
the time for the &s;itting of both
Hou&s;es; his a&s;&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary for the con|firmation
of their proceedings; and he pro|rogues
or di&s;&s;olves them, as appears to him
mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the authority of Go|vernment,
and the intere&s;ts of the people.</P>
<P>I have previou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that Mary|land
was originally &s;ettled by a colony of
Roman Catholicks, who emigrated from
<PB N="46" REF="94">
Ireland early in the la&s;t century, under
the patronage of the then Lord Baltimore.
For &s;ome time the inhabitants of that per|&s;ua&s;ion
maintained the entire a&s;cendancy;
but their numbers are at pre&s;ent very in|con&s;iderable,
and their influence of no
weight in the public concerns of the pro|vince.
They, however, continue to be
tolerated, without being permitted to par|ticipate
in the offices of government. The
e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is that of the church
of England, the members of which com|munion
very greatly exceed the aggregate
body of the di&s;&s;enters of every denomi|nation.</P>
<P>The province is divided into forty-four
pari&s;hes, many of which are populous and
exten&s;ive. The patronage is &s;olely ve&s;ted
in the governor, who is thereby enabled to
provide, in an ample manner, for many
worthy and re&s;pectable characters; and
<PB N="47" REF="95">
when all circum&s;tances are taken into con|&s;ideration,
the clergy in this part of the
world, will be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s advantages
greatly &s;uperior to the generality of their
brethren in the mother country. Plurali|ties
have never been admitted, the colo|ni&s;ts
being univer&s;ally prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t
that practice; and to attempt &s;uch an in|novation,
would excite ferments of a dan|gerous
nature. Each incumbent has a
neat and convenient habitation, with a
&s;ufficient quantity of land, in proper culti|vation
to an&s;wer every u&s;eful and dome&s;tic
purpo&s;e; and the emoluments ari&s;ing from
the lea&s;t beneficial preferment, are amply
&s;ufficient to &s;upport an appearance, per|fectly
con&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;pectability of
the clerical profe&s;&s;ion. The holders of
church benefices are al&s;o happily exempted
from the frequent altercations, which una|voidably
take place in the mother country,
on account of the collection of tythes.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="96">
By the laws of this province, all public
dues are levied by a poll-tax. The clergy,
from this provi&s;ion, are entitled to forty
pounds of Tobacco for every per&s;on within
a limited age, at the rate of twelve &s;hil|lings
and &s;ix-pence the hundred weight.
Per&s;ons who plant Tobacco have it in
their option to pay either in money or in
produce; tho&s;e who do not, are con&s;tantly
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;pecie. A li&s;t of the taxables,
properly authenticated, is delivered to the
&s;heriff of each county, who collects the
clerical revenues, with other public claims;
and deducting a moderate commi&s;&s;ion for
tran&s;acting this concern, the re&s;idue is paid
with regularity and di&s;patch, to the re&s;pec|tive
incumbents.</P>
<P>As the emoluments of benefices in|crea&s;e,
in proportion to the increa&s;e of
inhabitants, many benefices in this go|vernment
are rapidly advancing in value,
<PB N="49" REF="97">
and mu&s;t, before many years elap&s;e, very
greatly exceed the pre&s;ent annual amount.
Frederick County, which is con&s;iderably the
mo&s;t exten&s;ive in this province, in its pre|&s;ent
&s;tate, is only divided into two pari&s;hes,
one of which, denominated All Saints, I
am credibly informed is, at this period, e&s;ti|mated
at full one thou&s;and pounds &s;terling,
<HI>per annum;</HI> and from the great increa&s;e
of population, which is daily taking place
in that beautiful and fertile country,
it will, very probably, &s;oon produce an
income little inferior to many Engli&s;h
bi&s;hopricks.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive on what principle the
coloni&s;ts are &s;o &s;trongly prejudiced again&s;t
the introduction of the epi&s;copal order:
&s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment would a&s;&s;uredly be
attended with many local advantages, and
&s;ave much trouble and expen&s;e to gentlemen
<PB N="50" REF="98">
educated in America for the &s;acred func|tion,
who, on the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, are under
the nece&s;&s;ity of taking a voyage to England
for the purpo&s;e of ordination. Through|out
the &s;outhern provinces, the members
of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church greatly exceed
tho&s;e of all other denominations; yet I
am per&s;uaded, any attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h an
hierarchy, would be re&s;i&s;ted with as much
acrimony as during the gloomy prevalence
of puritanical zeal. This &s;pirit of oppo|&s;ition,
to a mea&s;ure &s;o evidently condu|cive
to the general good, is the more ex|traordinary,
as the inhabitants of this part
of America di&s;cover, on every po&s;&s;ible oc|ca&s;ion,
an enlarged and liberal di&s;po&s;ition.
They have, however, conceived &s;uch rooted
prejudices again&s;t the higher orders of the
church, that they are po&s;itively per&s;uaded
the advantages to be acquired, by &s;uch
an in&s;titution in the colonies, would by no
<PB N="51" REF="99">
means counter-balance the evils which
might ari&s;e from it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of epi&s;copacy in America, &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the war, is among tho&s;e very extra|ordinary circum&s;tances which cannot be accounted for by human penetration.</P>
<P>While the colonies were a part of the Briti&s;h empire, the introduction of dignitaries was oppo&s;ed with a mo&s;t determined &s;pirit, from an opinion, generally conceived, that the powers they would be authori&s;ed to exerci&s;e, might eventually be &s;ubver&s;ive of freedom; but when they were entirely at liberty to adopt any regulations for eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, totally independent of the mo|ther country, they voluntarily and unanimou&s;ly &s;olicited the con&s;ecration of bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>About three years &s;ince, two clergymen, one from New York, and the other from Philadelphia, arrived in England, and received epi&s;copal con&s;ecration. An act of Parliament had previou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;pen&s;ing with the oaths to the Briti&s;h government, in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e gentlemen, and in all &s;imilar ca&s;es. They were properly recommended hither, by a conven|tion of the clergy in the United States of America; and another of their brethren, &s;anctioned in like manner from Virginia, has been lately con&s;ecrated here, as bi&s;hop for that &s;tate, under the forementioned authority. So that there are three bi&s;hops now in that country, who will have full power to continue the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, which has exi&s;ted from the days of the apo&s;tles; not to mention a gentleman who, a con&s;iderable time before the others, had been con&s;ecrated by the non-jur|ing bi&s;hops in Scotland, and who re&s;ides in Connecticut. None of the&s;e, however, have any fixed income, but depend upon the voluntary contributions of their re&s;pec|tive congregations, to whom they regularly preach on &s;undays, and officiate as pari&s;h prie&s;ts. They have the title of <HI>Right Reverend,</HI> but have no particular powers, except that of ordaining deacons and prie&s;ts, and &s;uperin|tending the religious and moral conduct of the clergy, who are, in &s;ome &s;ort, rendered accountable to them. It is, I believe, generally allowed, that the members of the epi&s;copal church increa&s;e, throughout all the States, beyond any other denomination, although they are nearly upon an equality with the others, re&s;pecting the privileges from the civil power. In Briti&s;h America, there is a bi|&s;hop, chiefly re&s;ident in Nova Scotia, who has much the &s;ame di&s;tinction with tho&s;e already particulari&s;ed; but enjoys an e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;alary of about eleven hundred pounds &s;terling a year.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a political point of view, indepen|dent
of religious motives, it is much to
be lamented, that a plan of this nature was
not determined on, before the colonies had
arrived to their pre&s;ent degree of popula|tion
<PB N="52" REF="100">
and con&s;equence: had an order of
nobility been created, and dignitaries in
the church appointed at an early period, it
would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly have greatly tended
to cheri&s;h a &s;teady adherence to monar|chical
principles; and have more &s;trongly
<PB N="53" REF="101">
rivetted the attachment of the colonies
to the parent &s;tate. Inattention to prin|ciples
of &s;uch importance, has gradu|ally

to the genius of our mo&s;t excel|lent
con&s;titution. A republican &s;pirit ap|pears
<PB N="54" REF="102">
generally to predominate; and it will
undoubtedly require the utmo&s;t exertion
of legi&s;lative wi&s;dom, to e&s;tabli&s;h on a per|manent
ba&s;is, the future political and com|mercial
connexion between Great Britain

<P>There are many di&s;cerning and intel|ligent
per&s;ons, who are decidedly of opi|nion
that the acqui&s;ition of Canada is
highly prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of the
mother country. The Americans are, by
this event, relieved from continual appre|hen&s;ions;
their frontiers are no longer ex|po&s;ed
to the incur&s;ions of a re&s;tle&s;s enter|pri&s;ing
neighbour; and they begin to en|courage
ideas of &s;elf-importance, which
have been wonderfully promoted by the
&s;ucce&s;s attending their recent oppo&s;ition to
the operation of the &s;tamp duties.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="103">
Had Canada &s;till continued annexed to
the French empire, it is evident that the
Briti&s;h provinces, from a well-grounded
dread of &s;uch numerous and powerful op|ponents,
mu&s;t unavoidably, on a principle
of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, if not of affection, have
remained firmly and indi&s;&s;olubly attached to
the parent &s;tate: a ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of
real calamities would have operated with
efficacy again&s;t imaginary evils; and the
natural and con&s;titutional dependence of
the colonies, on the protection and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of Great Britain, would have pro|moted
a con&s;tant and mutual interchange
of friendly and benevolent offices, which
mu&s;t have &s;ettled the union on a perma|nent

honourable and advantageous to both coun|tries.</P>
<P>What will be the event of the pre&s;ent
di&s;contents, which, I am truly concerned

time alone can determine. There are
among&s;t us, many re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits, who are

<P>THOUGH we are yet far behind the
mother country, with re&s;pect to cul|tivation
and improvements, yet, in a com|parative
view, Maryland may boa&s;t con&s;i|derable
advantages. The inhabitants are
enterpri&s;ing and indu&s;trious; commerce
and agriculture are encouraged; and every
circum&s;tance clearly evinces, that this co|lony
is making a rapid progre&s;s to wealth,
power, and population.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions of every kind, are excellent
and plentiful; and the Che&s;apeak, with
our numerous rivers, affords a &s;urpri&s;ing
variety of excellent fi&s;h. Poultry, and
wild-fowl, abound among&s;t the humble
<PB N="58" REF="106">
cottagers; and beef, mutton, pork, and
other provi&s;ions, are at lea&s;t equal to the
production of the be&s;t Briti&s;h markets.</P>
<P>Deer, a few years &s;ince, were very nu|merous
in the interiour &s;ettlements; but,
from the unfair methods adopted by the
hunters, their numbers are exceedingly
dimini&s;hed. The&s;e people, who&s;e only mo|tive
was to procure the hide of the animal,
were dextrous, during the winter &s;ea&s;on, in
tracing their path through the &s;now; and
from the animal's incapacity to exert &s;peed,
under &s;uch circum&s;tances, great multi|tudes
of them were annually &s;laughtered,
and their carca&s;es left in the woods. This
practice, however, has been thought wor|thy
the attention of the legi&s;lature, and an
act of a&s;&s;embly has taken place, laying &s;e|vere
penalties on &startq;per&s;ons detected in
pur&s;uing or de&s;troying deer, within a
limited term;&endq; and it is probable, the
<PB N="59" REF="107">
apprehen&s;ion of puni&s;hment may very
greatly re&s;train, if not totally eradicate an
evil founded on cruelty and rapacity.</P>
<P>In England, almo&s;t every country is di&s;|tingui&s;hed
by a peculiar dialect; even dif|ferent
habits, and different modes of think|ing,
evidently di&s;criminate inhabitants,
who&s;e local &s;ituation is not far remote:
but in Maryland, and throughout the adja|cent
provinces, it is worthy of ob&s;ervation,
that a &s;triking &s;imilarity of &s;peech uni|ver&s;ally
prevails; and it is &s;trictly true, that
the pronunciation of the generality of the
people has an accuracy and elegance, that
cannot fail of gratifying the mo&s;t judicious
ear.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts are compo&s;ed of adventu|rers,
not only from every di&s;trict of Great
Britain and Ireland, but from almo&s;t every
other European government, where the
<PB N="60" REF="108">
principles of liberty and commerce have
operated with &s;pirit and efficacy. Is it not,
therefore, rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the
Engli&s;h language mu&s;t be greatly corrupted
by &s;uch a &s;trange intermixture of various
nations? The rever&s;e is, however, true.
The language of the immediate de&s;cendants
of &s;uch a promi&s;cuous ance&s;try is perfectly
uniform, and unadulterated; nor has it bor|rowed
any provincial, or national accent,
from its Briti&s;h or foreign parentage.</P>
<P>For my part, I confe&s;s my&s;elf totally at
a lo&s;s to account for the apparent diffe|rence,
between the coloni&s;ts and per&s;ons
under equal circum&s;tances of education
and fortune, re&s;ident in the mother coun|try.
This uniformity of language pre|vails
not only on the coa&s;t, where Euro|peans
form a con&s;iderable ma&s;s of the peo|ple,
but likewi&s;e in the interior parts,
where population has made but &s;low ad|vances;
<PB N="61" REF="109">
and where opportunities &s;eldom
occur to derive any great advantages from
an intercour&s;e with intelligent &s;trangers.</P>
<P>You, my friend, are &s;eated at the foun|tain
head of literary and political intelli|gence,
and from you I &s;hall expect fre|quent,

Mo&s;t &s;incerely do I wi&s;h you may be en|abled
to acquaint me, that the fir&s;t tran&s;|action
in the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament,
is a total repeal of acts, which are never
likely to be productive of any con&s;iderable
revenue; and which are e&s;teemed in this
country, to have no other tendency but to
enforce claims, which the coloni&s;ts univer|&s;ally
con&s;ider as impoliti$ and uncon&s;titu|tional.
How far their &s;entiments are ju&s;tly
founded, I am by no means competent to
determine; but it is a certain fact, that the
&s;tatute impo&s;ing duties on gla&s;s, paper, and
tea, has undermined the foundation of that

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sept. 20, 1770.</DATE></P>
<P>YOUR information relative to the
&s;ituation of &s;ervants in this country,
is far from being well-founded. I have
now been upwards of twelve months re|&s;ident
in Maryland, and am thereby en|abled
to convey to you a tolerable idea on
this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude are under
four di&s;tinct denominations: negroes, who
are the entire property of their re&s;pective
owners: convicts, who are tran&s;ported
from the mother country for a limited
term: indented &s;ervants, who are engaged
for five years previous to their leaving Eng|land;
and free-willers, who are &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="64" REF="112">
from their &s;ituation, to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperior ad|vantages.</P>
<P>The negroes in this province are, in
general, natives of the country; very few
in proportion being imported from the
coa&s;t of Africa. They are better cloathed,
better fed, and better treated, than their
unfortunate brethren, whom a more rigid
fate hath &s;ubjected to &s;lavery in our We&s;t
India i&s;lands; neither are their employ|ments
&s;o laborious, nor the acts of the
legi&s;lature &s;o partially oppre&s;&s;ive again&s;t
them. The further we proceed to the
northward, the le&s;s number of people are
to be found of this complexion: In the
New England government, negroes are al|mo&s;t
as &s;carce as on your &s;ide of the At|lantic,
and but few are under actual &s;la|very;
but as we advance to the &s;outh, their
multitudes a&s;toni&s;hingly increa&s;e, and in
<PB N="65" REF="113">
the Carolinas they con&s;iderably exceed the
number of white inhabitants<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding the climate of North America is le&s;s favourable to the con&s;titution of negroes than the European &s;ettlements in the Torrid Zone, they never|thele&s;s increa&s;e rapidly in almo&s;t every part of that ex|ten&s;ive continent. The la&s;t importation of &s;laves into Maryland was, as I am credibly informed, in the year 1769; and though great lo&s;&s;es have been &s;u&s;tained in con|&s;equence of the war, and de&s;ertions to the Briti&s;h &s;tand|ard, their numbers are at lea&s;t doubted &s;ince that time, without any foreign &s;upply. To account for a cir|cum&s;tance, apparently &s;o improbable, it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that on the American continent, the planters ge|nerally adopted a more liberal mode in their African in|tercour&s;e, than has been pur&s;ued in the i&s;lands. They did not import &s;laves for the &s;upply of foreign &s;ettlements, but purcha&s;ed for their own immediate u&s;e, without any particular preference to either &s;ex. The con&s;equence is obvious, they have multiplied in a due proportion, and notwith&s;tanding the occa&s;ional &s;everity of the cli|mate, and the recent calamities of war, their numbers are fully &s;ufficient for their re&s;pective occupations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="114">
Maryland is the only province into which
convicts may be freely imported. The
Virginians have inflicted very &s;evere penal|ties
on any ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, or others,
who may attempt to introduce per&s;ons un|der
this de&s;cription into their colony. They
have been influenced in this mea&s;ure by
an apprehen&s;ion, that, from the admi&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch inmates into their families, the
prevalence of bad example might tend to
univer&s;al depravity, in &s;pite of every regu|lation,
and re&s;training law.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons convicted of felony, and in con|&s;equence
tran&s;ported to this continent, if
they are able to pay the expence of pa&s;|&s;age,
are free to pur&s;ue their fortune agree|ably
to their inclinations or abilities. Few,
however, have means to avail them&s;elves
of this advantage. The&s;e unhappy beings
are, generally, con&s;igned to an agent, who
cla&s;&s;es them &s;uitably to their real or &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="67" REF="115">
qualifications; adverti&s;es them for
&s;ale, and di&s;po&s;es of them, for &s;even years,
to planters, to mechanics, and to &s;uch
as choo&s;e to retain them for dome&s;tic &s;er|vice.
Tho&s;e who &s;urvive the term of
&s;ervitude, &s;eldom e&s;tabli&s;h their re&s;idence
in this country: the &s;tamp of infamy is
too &s;trong upon them to be ea&s;ily era&s;ed:
they either return to Europe, and renew
their former practices; or, if they have
fortunately imbibed habits of hone&s;ty and
indu&s;try, they remove to a di&s;tant &s;itua|tion,
where they may hope to remain un|known,
and be enabled to pur&s;ue with
credit every po&s;&s;ible method of becoming
u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In your frequent excur&s;ions about the
great metropolis, you cannot but ob&s;erve
numerous adverti&s;ements, offering the mo&s;t
&s;educing encouragement to adventurers
under every po&s;&s;ible de&s;cription; to tho&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="116">
who are di&s;gu&s;ted with the frowns of for|tune
in their native land; and to tho&s;e
of an enterpri&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition, who are
tempted to court her &s;miles in a di&s;tant
region. The&s;e per&s;ons are referred to
agents, or crimps, who repre&s;ent the ad|vantages
to be obtained in America, in
colours &s;o alluring, that it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
to re&s;i&s;t their artifices. Unwary
per&s;ons are accordingly induced to enter
into articles, by which they engage to be|come
&s;ervants, agreeable to their re&s;pective
qualifications, for the term of five years;
every nece&s;&s;ary accommodation being found
them during the voyage; and every me|thod
taken that they may be treated
with tenderne&s;s and humanity during the
period of &s;ervitude; at the expiration of
which they are taught to expect, that op|portunities
will a&s;&s;uredly offer to &s;ecure to
the hone&s;t and indu&s;trious, a competent
provi&s;ion for the remainder of their days.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="117">
The generality of the inhabitants in this
province are very little acquainted with
tho&s;e fallacious pretences, by which num|bers
are continually induced to embark for
this continent. On the contrary, they
too generally conceive an opinion that
the difference is merely nominal between
the indented &s;ervant and the convicted
felon: nor will they readily believe that
people, who had the lea&s;t experience in
life, and who&s;e characters were unexcep|tionable,
would abandon their friends and
families, and their ancient connexions, for
a &s;ervile &s;ituation, in a remote appen|dage
to the Briti&s;h Empire. From this
per&s;ua&s;ion they rather con&s;ider the con|vict
as the more profitable &s;ervant, his
term being for &s;even, the latter only for
five years; and, I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve,
that there are but few in&s;tances wherein
they experience different treatment. Ne|groes
being a property for life, the death
<PB N="70" REF="118">
of &s;laves, in the prime of youth or &s;trength,
is a material lo&s;s to the proprietor; they
are, therefore, almo&s;t in every in&s;tance, un|der
more comfortable circum&s;tances than
the mi&s;erable European, over whom the
rigid planter exerci&s;es an inflexible &s;eve|rity.
They are &s;trained to the utmo&s;t to
perform their allotted labour; and, from
a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in many ca&s;es too ju&s;tly
founded, they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be receiv|ing
only the ju&s;t reward which is due to
repeated offences. There are doubtle&s;s
many exceptions to this ob&s;ervation, yet,
generally &s;peaking, they groan beneath a
wor&s;e than Egyptian bondage. By at|tempting
to lighten the intolerable bur|then,
they often render it more in&s;up|portable.
For real, or imaginary cau&s;es,
the&s;e frequently attempt to e&s;cape, but
very few are &s;ucce&s;sful; the country
being inter&s;ected with rivers, and the ut|mo&s;t
vigilance ob&s;erved in detecting per|&s;ons
<PB N="71" REF="119">
under &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, who,
when apprehended, are committed to clo&s;e
confinement, adverti&s;ed, and delivered to
their re&s;pective ma&s;ters; the party who
detects the vagrant being entitled to a re|ward.
Other incidental charges ari&s;e. The
unhappy culprit is doomed to a &s;evere cha&s;|ti&s;ement;
and a prolongation of &s;ervitude
is decreed in full proportion to expences
incurred, and &s;uppo&s;ed inconveniences re|&s;ulting
from a de&s;ertion of duty.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the free-willer is, in
almo&s;t every in&s;tance, more to be lament|ed
than either that of the convict or the
indented &s;ervant; the deception which is
practi&s;ed on tho&s;e of this de&s;cription being
attended with circum&s;tances of greater du|plicity
and cruelty. Per&s;ons under this
denomination are received under expre&s;s
conditions that, on their arrival in Ame|rica,
they are to be allowed a &s;tipulated
<PB N="72" REF="120">
number of days to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves to
the greate&s;t advantage. They are told, that
their &s;ervices will be eagerly &s;olicited, in
proportion to their abilities; that their re|ward
will be adequate to the hazard they
encounter by courting fortune in a di&s;tant
region; and that the parties with whom
they engage will readily advance the &s;um
agreed on for their pa&s;&s;age; which, being
averaged at about nine pounds &s;terling,
they will &s;peedily be enabled to repay, and
to enjoy, in a &s;tate of liberty, a compara|tive
&s;ituation of ca&s;e and affluence.</P>
<P>With the&s;e plea&s;ing ideas they &s;upport,
with cheerfulne&s;s, the hard&s;hips to which
they are &s;ubjected during the voyage; and,
with the mo&s;t anxious &s;en&s;ations of de|light,
approach the land which they con|&s;ider
as the &s;cene of future pro&s;perity. But
&s;carce have they contemplated the diver&s;i|fied
objects which naturally attract atten|tion;
<PB N="73" REF="121">
&s;carce have they yielded to the plea&s;|ing
reflection, that every danger, every
difficulty, is happily &s;urmounted, before
their fond hopes are cruelly bla&s;ted, and they
find them&s;elves involved in all the com|plicated
mi&s;eries of a tedious, laborious,
and unprofitable &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons re&s;ident in America, being ac|cu&s;tomed
to procure &s;ervants for a very
trifling con&s;ideration, under ab&s;olute terms,
for a limited period, are not often di&s;po&s;ed
to hire adventurers, who expect to be gra|tified
in full proportion to their acknow|ledged
qualifications; but, as they &s;up|port
authority with a rigid hand, they little
regard the former &s;ituation of their unhap|py
dependants.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition, which is almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally
prevalent, is well known to the
parties, who on your &s;ide of the Atlantic
<PB N="74" REF="122">
engage in this iniquitous and cruel com|merce.
It is, therefore, an article of
agreement with the&s;e deluded victims, that
if they are not &s;ucce&s;sful in obtaining &s;itu|ations,
on their own terms, within a cer|tain
number of days after their arrival in
the country, they are then to be &s;old, in
order to defray the charges of pa&s;&s;age, at
the di&s;cretion of the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el,
or the agent to whom he is con&s;igned in
the province.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that &s;ervants
imported, even under this favourable de|&s;cription,
are rarely permitted to &s;et their
feet on &s;hore, until they have ab&s;olutely
formed their re&s;pective engagements. As
&s;oon as the &s;hip is &s;tationed in her birth,
planters, mechanics, and others, repair on
board; the adventurers of both &s;exes are
expo&s;ed to view, and very few are happy
enough to make their own &s;tipulations,
<PB N="75" REF="123">
&s;ome very extraordinary qualifications be|ing
ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to obtain this
di&s;tinction; and even when this is ob|tained,
the advantages are by no means
equivalent to their &s;anguine expectations.
The re&s;idue, &s;tung with di&s;appointment
and vexation, meet with horror the mo|ment
which dooms them, under an ap|pearance
of equity, to a limited term of
&s;lavery. Character is of little importance;
their abilities not being found of a &s;upe|rior
nature, they are &s;old as &s;oon as their
term of election is expired, apparel and
provi&s;ion being their only compen&s;ation;
till, on the expiration of five tedious labo|rious
years, they are re&s;tored to a dearly
purcha&s;ed freedom.</P>
<P>From this detail, I am per&s;uaded, you
will no longer imagine, that the &s;ervants
in this country are in a better &s;ituation than
tho&s;e in Britain. You have heard of con|victs
<PB N="76" REF="124">
who rather cho&s;e to undergo the &s;e|vere&s;t
penalties of the law, than endure the
hard&s;hips which are annexed to their &s;itu|ation,
during a &s;tate of &s;ervitude on this
&s;ide the Atlantic. Indolence, accompanied
with a train of vicious habits, has, doubtle&s;s,
great influence on the determination of
&s;uch unhappy wretches; but it is &s;urely
to be lamented that men, who&s;e charac|ters
are unblemi&s;hed, who&s;e views are
founded on hone&s;t and indu&s;trious princi|ples,
&s;hould fall a &s;acrifice to avarice and
delu&s;ion, and indi&s;criminately be blended
with the mo&s;t profligate and abandoned of
mankind.</P>
<P>It &s;eems a&s;toni&s;hing, that a circum&s;tance
&s;o well known, particularly in this pro|vince,
&s;hould not have been generally cir|culated
through every part of the Briti&s;h
Empire. Were the particulars of this ini|quitous
traffic univer&s;ally divulged, tho&s;e
<PB N="77" REF="125">
who have e&s;tabli&s;hed offices in London,
and in the principal &s;ea-ports, for the re|gular
conduct of this bu&s;ine&s;s, would be
pointed out to obloquy, and their puni&s;h|ment
would &s;erve as a beacon to deter the
ignorant and unwary from becoming vic|tims
to the in&s;idious practices of avarice
and deceit.</P>
<P>I am ready to admit there is every ap|pearance
of candour on the part of the
agents, and their accomplices. Previous
to the embarcation of any per&s;on under
the re&s;pective agreements, the parties re|gularly
comply with the requi&s;itions of
a law, wi&s;ely calculated to prevent clan|de&s;tine
tran&s;portation; they appear before
a magi&s;trate, and give their voluntary
a&s;&s;ent to the obligations they have mu|tually
entered into. But are not &s;uch ad|venturers
induced to this mea&s;ure in con|&s;equence
of ignorance and mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion?
A&s;&s;uredly they are. They are in|du&s;triou&s;ly
<PB N="78" REF="126">
taught to expect advantages in|finitely
&s;uperior to their mo&s;t &s;anguine views
in Britain. Every lucrative incentive is
delineated in the mo&s;t flattering colours;
and they fondly expect to acquire that in|dependence
in the revolution of a few years,
which the longe&s;t life could not promi&s;e,
with the exertion of their be&s;t abilities, in
the bo&s;om of their native country.</P>
<P>I will relieve your attention from this
painful &s;ubject, by relating an anecdote of
an intere&s;ting nature, with which I be|came
acquainted &s;oon after my arrival in
the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>A gentleman of con&s;iderable influence
and fortune, purcha&s;ed a &s;ervant as an a&s;|&s;i&s;tant
to his gardener; having been pre|viou&s;ly
informed that he had originally act|ed
in that capacity, and was qualified for
the undertaking. The man, &s;oon after he
<PB N="79" REF="127">
was brought on &s;hore, received in&s;tructions
to enter on his bu&s;ine&s;s, when it was im|mediately
di&s;covered, that he was wholly
unacquainted with the nature of his em|ployment.
On being interrogated relative
to this deception, he acquainted his ma&s;ter,
that &startq;extreme indigence induced him to
abandon his native country&mdash;that in the
cour&s;e of the voyage, having intimated
that he had not been brought up to any
mechanical profe&s;&s;ion, he was inform|ed
by the captain, it was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
he &s;hould avow &s;ome particular
calling, in order to &s;ecure a more com|fortable
&s;ituation; that in America, a
competent &s;kill in gardening was ea&s;ily
attainable, and &s;eldom required the ex|ertion
of greater talents than what
were immediately e&s;&s;ential for dome&s;tic
purpo&s;es; and that by engaging in
&s;uch employment, he might avoid a
more laborious &s;ervitude, under the
<PB N="80" REF="128">
di&s;cipline of &s;ome rigid and inflexible
planter.&endq;</P>
<P>This declaration was delivered in terms
&s;o apparently con&s;i&s;tent with truth, as ob|tained
entire credit with his ma&s;ter, who
from his deportment, and exterior, was
likewi&s;e induced to form &s;entiments much
to his advantage: he therefore determined
to receive him into his family, in the capa|city
of a dome&s;tic, and to give him that en|couragement,
to which he might be entitled
by the propriety of his future conduct.</P>
<P>Every &s;entiment of gratitude appeared
to operate on the mind of the &s;ervant,
when he found him&s;elf de&s;tined to a &s;tation
more comfortable than his original allot|ment;
and, for &s;ome time, the whole te|nor
of his actions was &s;uch as might &s;hew,
that he highly merited the indulgence
which he had &s;o unexpectedly obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="129">
For a few months his diligence and at|tention
&s;ecured him the entire appro|bation
of his ma&s;ter, and he was conti|nually
gaining ground on his confidence
and e&s;teem. It was, therefore, with the
utmo&s;t concern, his benefactor began to
ob&s;erve an appearance of di&s;content, a di&s;|regard
to the duties of his &s;tation, and an
evident alteration in every particular. Re|mon&s;trances
and threats were equally in|effectual:
his di&s;po&s;ition became &s;ullen, and
re&s;erved; while he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to a&s;|&s;ign
any cau&s;e for &s;uch an obvious change
in his conduct. At length, he quitted
the hou&s;e of his benevolent employer, and
by travelling in the night, and lying con|cealed
in the day, he took the proper pre|cautions
to elude the vigilance of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>His plan, though well concerted, was,
neverthele&s;s, ineffectual. In a few days
he was di&s;covered, almo&s;t fami&s;hed. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="82" REF="130">
compelled him to &s;upplicate the aid
of charity: his &s;tory was equivocal, and
excited &s;u&s;picion; he obtained relief, but
with the detention of his per&s;on. A ma|gi&s;trate,
before whom he was conveyed,
threatened him with confinement and ri|gorous
treatment, unle&s;s he gave a proper
and &s;atisfactory account from whence he
came, and the circum&s;tances which had
reduced him to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Find|ing
every fallacious pretext fruitle&s;s, he
made a candid and explicit di&s;covery, and
was, in con&s;equence, with all po&s;&s;ible ex|pedition,
conducted to the pre&s;ence of a
ma&s;ter, who&s;e tenderne&s;s he had ba&s;ely
returned
with &s;uch unpardonable ingra|titude.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate nature is &s;el|dom
proof again&s;t repeated in&s;tances of
an incorrigible di&s;po&s;ition. It was there|fore
thought nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould ex|perience
<PB N="83" REF="131">
the con&s;equences of his behavi|our,
but he was previou&s;ly reminded of the
repeated acts of kindne&s;s that had been
&s;hown him, and the ungrateful return the
had made. From &s;uch con&s;iderations it
was ob&s;erved, that it was a debt &s;trictly
due to ju&s;tice to compel him to &s;erve
the re&s;idue of his time in the mo&s;t labori|ous
employment allotted to worthle&s;s &s;er|vants.
He was accordingly &s;entenced to
the iron mines, there to reap the bitter
effects of his conduct.</P>
<P>Overwhelmed with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
guilt, and terrified at the pro&s;pect of the
puni&s;hment that awaited him, the un|fortunate
culprit, in the mo&s;t ingenuous
terms, confe&s;&s;ed the equity of the &s;entence
pa&s;&s;ed upon him, but not without an inti|mation,
that there were circum&s;tances in
his ca&s;e which, were they known, he was
per&s;uaded, would plead powerfully in his
<PB N="84" REF="132">
behalf. An irre&s;i&s;table inclination to re|turn
to his native country, and the ob&s;ta|cles
which appeared to bar his delu&s;ive
hopes, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind with that
gloom and di&s;content, which had almo&s;t
obliterated the impre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, and
occa&s;ioned that conduct which had brought
him into his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He con|cluded
by declaring, that he had not the
mo&s;t di&s;tant claim to compa&s;&s;ion, yet rely|ing
on that goodne&s;s and lenity which he
had &s;o frequently abu&s;ed, he was encou|raged
to admit a ray of hope, and to &s;up|plicate
forgivene&s;s, however unde&s;erved.</P>
<P>His humane ma&s;ter heard him with the
mo&s;t candid attention. He pitied a devia|tion
from rectitude, which originated in
motives natural to the human mind; and
determined not only to exempt him from
the &s;ituation to which he had been ju&s;tly
doomed, but to &s;end him, by an early op|portunity,
to his much loved native coun|try,
<PB N="85" REF="133">
there to pur&s;ue &s;uch eligible methods
as Providence might &s;ugge&s;t for his fu|ture
comfortable provi&s;ion. I &s;hall not
attempt to delineate the tran&s;ports which
on this intimation took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
mind.</P>
<P>About this time, the captain of a &s;hip
preparing to &s;ail for England, &s;ignified his
want of a &s;teward to attend on tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;engers
who had engaged his cabin for the
voyage: the emancipated &s;ervant was re|commended
for this employment; his &s;er|vices
were accepted; and with &s;olemn
a&s;&s;urances of the mo&s;t la&s;ting and grateful
attachment, he bade farewel to a ma&s;ter,
by who&s;e generous, di&s;intere&s;ted conduct,
he was &s;o providentially re&s;tored to happi|ne&s;s
and to liberty.</P>
<P>Two years elap&s;ed without the lea&s;t in|telligence
re&s;pecting his &s;ituation, when, at
length, a letter arrived, filled with every
<PB N="86" REF="134">
&s;entiment of gratitude. &startq;His &s;en&s;e of
repeated obligations was acknowledg|ed
in terms which delineated a heart
con&s;cious of the important benefits he
had experienced; and he concluded by
entreating his late ma&s;ter's acceptance
of a bill, as a trifling con&s;ideration for
the re&s;idue of that time, which he had
been &s;o generou&s;ly and humanely ex|empted
from &s;erving.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;um remitted, very greatly exceeded
the original co&s;t of the mo&s;t valuable &s;er|vant.
In this epi&s;tle, not the lea&s;t inti|mation
was given, relative to the circum|&s;tance
which had enabled a man, &s;o lately
at the lowe&s;t ebb of mi&s;ery, to &s;pare from
his immediate occa&s;ions, &s;o con&s;iderable a
&s;um as <HI>thirty pounds;</HI> but an an&s;wer was
reque&s;ted, to be addre&s;&s;ed to a merchant in
London, that the party concerned might
be properly apprized his bill was received
and acknowledged.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="135">
Mr. I&mdash;was inexpre&s;&s;ibly happy in the
plea&s;ing reflection, that, by an indulgence
of lenity, natural to his di&s;po&s;ition, he had
been rendered by Heaven the in&s;trument
of &s;uch unexpected pro&s;perity. He could
not, for a moment, admit the idea of ap|propriating
any part of &s;uch money to him|&s;elf,
as the payment of a debt&punc; which
he con&s;idered as a free donation to the
claims of humanity; but he was naturally
anxious to become acquainted with the par|ticular
events by which his late &s;ervant was
&s;o happily &s;ituated as to obtain the power
of tran&s;mitting &s;uch a proof of his ho|ne&s;ty
and gratitude. He, therefore, im|mediately
addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the merchant,
expre&s;&s;ive of the &startq;&s;atisfaction he expe|rienced
in receiving intelligence of &s;uch
an agreeable nature, and de&s;iring him
to return the note, which he had en|clo&s;ed
for that purpo&s;e, into the hands
of the party who had conceived it his&endq;
<PB N="88" REF="136">
&startq;duty to tran&s;mit it, with earne&s;t wi&s;hes,
that his future &s;ucce&s;&s;es might amply
compen&s;ate for every former calamity.
He had only to reque&s;t, that by an early
opportunity, he would afford him the
&s;atisfaction of knowing, by what un|expected
circum&s;tance he had been &s;o
rapidly, and &s;o providentially favoured
with the &s;miles of fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>By the return of the fir&s;t &s;hip, an an|&s;wer
from the agent arrived. The bill was
&s;ent back, with an earne&s;t entreaty, that
if Mr. J&mdash;refu&s;ed to apply it to his
particular occa&s;ions, he would appropriate
it to &s;ome charitable purpo&s;e: that with
re&s;pect to the &s;ituation of the man, for|merly
his &s;ervant, there were powerful rea|&s;ons
which precluded him from giving
the information he reque&s;ted. All that
he was at liberty to di&s;clo&s;e was, that the
per&s;on who had vi&s;ited America, under
<PB N="89" REF="137">
circum&s;tances &s;o de&s;perate and forlorn;
who had been nece&s;&s;itated to become a
common indented &s;ervant, &s;ubject to all
the hard&s;hips and mi&s;eries incident to &s;o
abject a condition, was, by an a&s;toni&s;hing
tran&s;ition of fortune, elevated to a very
affluent and re&s;pectable &s;ituation in his
native country.</P>
<P>The above particulars were delivered to
me by the benevolent ma&s;ter him&s;elf, who
during a cour&s;e of years, has a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly
endeavoured, by every eligible mode of
inquiry, to develop a &s;ecret &s;o indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
concealed from his knowledge: but
every method has hitherto proved ineffec|tual;

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 18, 1771.</DATE></P>
<P>YOU ob&s;erve, that in the cour&s;e of
my corre&s;pondence, I have not par|ticularly
mentioned any towns of con&s;e|quence,
within the limits of this govern|ment.
In all probability, from the mul|titude
of rivers which, with their branches,
inter&s;ect this country in almo&s;t every direc|tion,
Maryland will never abound with
ports, or e&s;tabli&s;hments of any con&s;idera|ble
magnitude. By the advantage of &s;o
many navigable waters, an opportunity is
afforded to &s;hip the produce of many ex|ten&s;ive
di&s;tricts, even at the doors of the
re&s;pective planters; who, con&s;equently,
have not that inducement, common to
mo&s;t countries, for e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves
in populous communities.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="139">
Frederick County alone, from its inte|rior
&s;ituation, appears precluded from this
benefit. But &s;hould a plan, now in agi|tation,
to remove the ob&s;tructions in the
great river Patowmac, be attended with
the de&s;ired con&s;equences, that very fer|tile
and exten&s;ive country will, in a
great mea&s;ure, participate in the advan|tages
which are common to the other parts
of the province.</P>
<P>On the arrival of Lord Baltimore, the
original proprietor, with tho&s;e families
who had emigrated under the grant which
he had obtained from the Crown, the fir&s;t
e&s;tabli&s;hment was formed on the northern
&s;hore of the Patowmac. The bounds
of a town were a&s;certained; temporary
habitations were erected; and this place,
which was de&s;tined to be the &s;eat of go|vernment,
was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name
of St. Mary's Town. But in proce&s;s of
<PB N="92" REF="140">
time, that &s;ituation at the &s;outhern extre|mity
of the province, was con&s;idered to
be inconvenient for the di&s;patch of public
bu&s;ine&s;s; and another &s;pot more central
was &s;elected, which appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s
every po&s;&s;ible advantage. Proper encou|ragement
was given to promote popula|tion;
a charter of incorporation was ob|tained;
and the new metropolis, in ho|nour
of the then reigning monarch, re|ceived
the appellation of Annapolis.</P>
<P>In a former letter, I attempted to con|vey
&s;ome idea of the truly picture&s;que and
beautiful &s;ituation of our little capital. Se|veral
of the mo&s;t opulent families have
here e&s;tabli&s;hed their re&s;idence; and ho&s;|pitality
is the characteri&s;tic of the inhabi|tants.
Party prejudices have little influ|ence
on &s;ocial intercour&s;e: the grave and
ancient enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of a re&s;pectable
<PB N="93" REF="141">
&s;ociety, while the young and gay have va|rious
amu&s;ements to engage their hours of
relaxation, and to promote that mutual
connexion &s;o e&s;&s;ential to their future hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>You well know, that I have ever been
&s;trongly attached to the rational enter|tainment
re&s;ulting from theatrical exhibi|tions.
When I bade farewel to England,
I little expected that my pa&s;&s;ion for the
drama could have been gratified, in any
tolerable degree, at a di&s;tance &s;o remote
from the great mart of genius; and I
brought with me &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in be|half
of favourite performers, who&s;e merits
were fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the univer&s;al &s;anc|tion
of intelligent judges. My plea&s;ure and
my &s;urpri&s;e were therefore excited in propor|tion,
on finding performers in this country
equal, at lea&s;t, to tho&s;e who &s;u&s;tain the be&s;t
of the fir&s;t characters in your mo&s;t celebrated
<PB N="94" REF="142">
provincial theatres. Our governor, from a
&s;trong conviction that the &s;tage, under pro|per
regulations, may be rendered of general
utility, and made &s;ub&s;ervient to the great
intere&s;ts of religion and virtue, patronizes
the American Company; and as their pre|&s;ent
place of exhibition is on a &s;mall &s;cale,
and inconveniently &s;ituated, a &s;ub&s;crip|tion,
by his example, has been rapidly com|pleted
to errect a new theatre, on a com|modious,
if not an elegant plan. The
manager is to deliver tickets for two &s;ea|&s;ons,
to the amount of the re&s;pective &s;ub|&s;criptions;
and it is imagined, that the
money which will be received at the doors,
from non-&s;ub&s;cribers, will enable him to
conduct the bu&s;ine&s;s without difficulty;
and when the limited number of perfor|mances
is completed, the intire property
is to be ve&s;ted in him. This will be a
valuable addition to our catalogue of amu&s;e|ments.
The building is already in a &s;tate
<PB N="95" REF="143">
of forwardne&s;s, and the day of opening is
anxiou&s;ly expected. This circum&s;tance
has carried me inadvertently from my pro|per
&s;ubject. Give me pardon for the di|gre&s;&s;ion.
I will return into the road from
which I deviated.</P>
<P>Annapolis, with every advantage to ren|der
it an agreeable re&s;idence, labours under
inconveniences which will greatly impede
its progre&s;s to commercial importance.
The harbour, as I have formerly ob&s;erved,
is not &s;ufficiently commodious for ve&s;&s;els
of con&s;iderable burden; and the road is
too much expo&s;ed, to lade or unlade with
&s;afety or convenience. But the province
has been amply compen&s;ated for this di&s;|appointment,
by the ri&s;e of a &s;ettlement,
which in the memory of many per&s;ons now
in being, has increa&s;ed with the mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing
rapidity; and promi&s;es, by an equal
progre&s;s, to rank with the mo&s;t populous
<PB N="96" REF="144">
and opulent e&s;tabli&s;hments on this &s;ide the
Atlantic.</P>
<P>This place, which is named Baltimore,
in compliment to the proprietary-family,
is &s;ituated on the northern branch of the
river Patap&s;co, about thirty miles higher
up the bay of Che&s;apeak than Annapolis;
and at nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance by land.
Within the&s;e few years&punc; &s;ome &s;cattered cot|tages
were only to be found on this &s;pot,
occupied by ob&s;cure &s;torekeepers, merely
for the &s;upply of the adjacent plantations.
But the peculiar advantages it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es,
with re&s;pect to the trade of the frontier
counties of Virginia, Penn&s;ylvania, and
Maryland, &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed the mind
of Mr. John Steven&s;on, an Iri&s;h gentle|man,
who had &s;ettled in the vicinity in a
medical capacity, that he fir&s;t conceiv|ed
the important project, of rendering
this port the grand emporium of Mary|land
<PB N="97" REF="145">
commerce. He accordingly appli|ed
him&s;elf, with a&s;&s;iduity, to the com|pletion
of his plan. The neighbouring
country being fertile, well &s;ettled, and
abounding in grain; Mr. S&mdash;con|tracted
for con&s;iderable quantities of wheat,
he freighted ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;igned them to
a corre&s;pondent in his native country: the
cargoes &s;old to great advantage, and re|turns
were made equally beneficial. The
commencement of a trade &s;o lucrative to
the fir&s;t adventurers, &s;oon became an ob|ject
of univer&s;al attention. Per&s;ons of a
commercial and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, emi|grated
from all quarters to this new and
promi&s;ing &s;cene of indu&s;try. Wharfs were
con&s;tructed; elegant and convenient habi|tations
were rapidly erected; mar&s;hes were
drained; &s;pacious fields were occupied for
the purpo&s;es of general utility; and within
forty years, from its fir&s;t commencement,
Baltimore became not only the mo&s;t weal|thy
<PB N="98" REF="146">
and populous town in the province,
but inferior to few on this continent, either
in &s;ize, number of inhabitants, or the ad|vantages

of the province, was much con&s;ured
for having procured con$iderable tracts of
lands, in the vicinity of that river, which
it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed could not even
repay the trifling charge of the purcha&s;e,
for many &s;ucceeding generations. The
richne&s;s of the &s;oil, and the &s;alubrity of
the air, operated, however, very power|fully
to promote population; but what
chiefly tended to the advancement of &s;et|tlements
in this remote di&s;trict, was the
arrival of many emigrants from the pala|tinate,
and other Germanic States. The&s;e
people who, from their earlie&s;t days, had
been di&s;ciplined in habits of indu&s;try, &s;o|briety,
frugality, and patience, were pecu|liarly
fitted for the laborious occupations of
$elling timber, clearing land, and forming
the fir&s;t improvements; and the &s;ucce&s;s
which attended their efforts, induced mul|titudes
of their enterpri&s;ing countrymen
<PB N="100" REF="148">
to abandon their native homes, to enjoy
the plenteous harve&s;t which appeared to
await their labours in the wild, unculti|vated
wa&s;tes of America.</P>
<P>The Germans were not the only people
&s;en&s;ible of the advantages to be derived
from e&s;tabli&s;hments in this interior country.
Many Briti&s;h adventurers, and natives of
the coa&s;t, where land was becoming &s;carce
and difficult to be acquired, were equally
emulous on this occa&s;ion; and it is a&s;to|ni&s;hing
how &s;oon exten&s;ive fore&s;ts became
highly cultivated, and promi&s;ing &s;ettle|ments
began on all &s;ides to extend them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the real and imaginary nece&s;|&s;ities
of tho&s;e, by who&s;e per&s;evering efforts,
and penetrating genius, immen&s;e unculti|vated
tracts became flouri&s;hing e&s;tabli&s;h|ments,
&s;torekeepers of various denomina|tions
<PB N="101" REF="149">
were encouraged to pur&s;ue the path
which indu&s;try had pointed out. Ware|hou&s;es
were accordingly erected, and
woollens, linnens, and implements of hu&s;|bandry,
were fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the view of
the laborious planter. As wealth and po|pulation
increa&s;ed, wants were created,
and many con&s;iderable demands, in con&s;e|quence,
took place for the various elegan|cies,
as well as nece&s;&s;aries of life: and thus,
by imperceptible degrees, from an humble
beginning, has Frederick Town ari&s;en to
its pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate.</P>
<P>This place exceeds Annapolis in &s;ize,
and in the number of inhabitants. It con|tains
one large and convenient church, for
the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion;
and &s;everal chapels for the accommodation
of the German and other di&s;&s;enters. The
buildings, though mo&s;tly of wood, have a
neat and regular appearance. Provi&s;ions
<PB N="102" REF="150">
are cheap, plentiful, and excellent. In a
word, here are to be $ound all conveniences,
and many &s;uperfluities; a lucrative trade is
&s;upported with the back country, and a
con&s;iderable quantity of grain is &s;ent from
hence, by land carriage, to Baltimore, for
exportation to the European markets.</P>
<P>The above excepted, there are not any
towns of con&s;equence in the province of
Maryland; the re&s;t, which bear that de|nomination,
are rather incon&s;iderable vil|lages,
the re&s;idence of a few merchants
and &s;torekeepers, with a &s;ufficient a&s;&s;ort|ment
of goods for the &s;upply of the neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P>Ship building, throughout this continent,
is a very lucrative and exten&s;ive branch
of bu&s;ine&s;s; and I am a&s;&s;ured by many,
who are e&s;teemed competent judges, that
American ve&s;&s;els are, in general, moulded
<PB N="103" REF="151">
in a very elegant and &s;uperior &s;tile. The
immen&s;e quantity of u&s;eful timber to be
found, even on the banks of almo&s;t every
river, gives the &s;hipwright peculiar ad|vantages.
The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, when perfectly
completed, exclu&s;ive of particular decora|tions,
are freighted with produce to &s;ome
Briti&s;h port, and are generally &s;old after
the delivery of their re&s;pective cargoes.</P>
<P>As an Engli&s;hman, I cannot but enjoy
the reflection, that Great Britain will ever
maintain a decided &s;uperiority in the dura|bility
and intrin&s;ic value of her &s;hipping.
Were a judgment, indeed, to be formed
from external appearances, a ca&s;ual ob|&s;erver
would not fail to decide, as to this
article, in favour of Maryland, and the
adjacent provinces; American oak, greatly
exceeding the Briti&s;h in &s;ize and foliage;
but when the growth is taken into
<PB N="104" REF="152">
con&s;ideration, a manife&s;t advantage is evi|dent
in favour of the oaks of Britain. On
this continent, this very u&s;eful and valua|ble
timber attains its highe&s;t &s;tate of per|fection
in about fifty or &s;ixty years: the
natural con&s;equence is, that being of a
light and porous quality, it will not endure
the depredations of time, in any degree
equal to that which advance by &s;low de|grees
to maturity. I have heard it a&s;&s;erted,
by per&s;ons of undoubted knowledge and
experience, that an Engli&s;h &s;hip, formed
of &s;olid and well-&s;ea&s;oned materials, is
worth more after a &s;ervice of twenty years,
than the generality of American ve&s;&s;els
that have &s;ailed only &s;even.</P>
<P>This rea&s;on, I think, &s;trongly operates
again&s;t tho&s;e, who penetrating into futu|rity,
predict that the coloni&s;ts mu&s;t in|evitably,
before many years are pa&s;&s;ed, be|come
<PB N="105" REF="153">
great and formidable as a maritime
power; &s;ince the nece&s;&s;ity under which
they mu&s;t labour, of frequently rebuilding,
in order to &s;upport a navy, cannot but be
attended with expences that will require
immen&s;e revenues; &s;o as always to check
their progre&s;s towards that di&s;tinction to

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Nov. 2, 1771.</DATE></P>
<P>IN this remote region, my dear friend,
the phantom plea&s;ure is pur&s;ued with
as much avidity as on your &s;ide of the At|lantic;
and certainly with as much grati|fication,
except by the injudicious herd
who form ideas of happine&s;s from compa|ri&s;on
alone.</P>
<P>Our races, which are ju&s;t concluded,
continued four days, and afforded excel|lent
amu&s;ement to tho&s;e who are attached
to the plea&s;ures of the turf; and, &s;urpri&s;|ing
as it may appear, I a&s;&s;ure you there
are few meetings in England better at|tended,
or where more capital hor&s;es are
exhibited.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="155">
In order to encourage the breed of this
noble animal, a jockey club has been in|&s;tituted,
con&s;i&s;ting of many principal gen|tlemen
in this and in the adjacent provinces,
many of whom have imported from Bri|tain,
at a very great expence, hor&s;es of
high reputation.</P>
<P>In America, the mild beauties of the
autumnal months amply compen&s;ate for
the fervent heats of $ummer, and the rigid
feverity of winter. Nothing could exceed
the charming $erenity of the weather dur|ing
the&s;e races; in con&s;equence of which
there was a prodigious concour&s;e of &s;pec|tators,
and con&s;iderable &s;ums were depend|ing
on the conte&s;t of each day. On the
fir&s;t, a pur&s;e of one hundred guineas was
run for, free only for the members of the
club; and on the three following days &s;ub|&s;cription
pur&s;es of fifty pounds each. A&s;|&s;emblies,
and theatrical repre&s;entations,
<PB N="108" REF="156">
were the amu&s;ements of the evening, at
which the company exhibited a fa&s;hionable
and brilliant appearance.</P>
<P>Our new theatre, of which I gave you
an account in a former letter, was opened
to a numerous audience the week preced|ing
the races. The &s;tructure is not inele|gant,
but, in my opinion, on too narrow
a &s;cale for its length; the boxes are com|modious,
and neatly decorated; the pit and
gallery are calculated to hold a number of
people without incommoding each other;
the &s;tage is well adapted for dramatic and
pantomimical exhibitions; and &s;everal of
the &s;cenes reflect great credit on the ability
of the painter. I have before ob&s;erved,
that the performers are con&s;iderably above
meciocrity; therefore little doubt can be
entertained of their pre&s;erving the public
favour, and reaping a plenteous harve&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="157">
Thus far on the article of plea&s;ure. I
&s;hall conclude with an ob&s;ervation of a &s;e|rious
nature.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my excur&s;ions, I have
conver&s;ed with divers intelligent planters,
who emigrated to this country, on account
of various di&s;couraging circum&s;tances which
baffled their utmo&s;t indu&s;try at home. A
principal cau&s;e which has been a&s;&s;igned by
very many for becoming adventurers in this
part of the world, is the cu&s;tom, which is
becoming too prevalent in England, of
farming exten&s;ive farms, for the accommo|dation
of wealthy tenants, and for greater
facility in collecting the rents.</P>
<P>Whatever pre&s;ent advantages may ari&s;e
from this practice, be a&s;&s;ured a per&s;eve|rance
therein will be attended with con|&s;equences
very prejudicial, for by this
means a &s;en&s;ible depopulation will en&s;ue;
<PB N="110" REF="158">
a con&s;iderable tract of country will be oc|cupied
by few inhabitants, and a multitude
of valuable members of the community,
will be obliged to abandon their homes and
connexions, and to court fortune in a di&s;|tant
region, where land may be procured
for a trifling con&s;ideration, and where the
greate&s;t encouragement is held out to &s;kill
and application.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on and experience inconte&s;tibly prove
that in the number of inhabitants con&s;i&s;ts
the power and pro&s;perity of the &s;tate. Agri|culture,
manufactures, and arts, are found|ed
on population, and a government natu|rally
becomes wealthy and formidable, by
the &s;trenuous exertions of indu&s;trious com|petition.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Dec. 24, 1771.</DATE></P>
<P>THE inten&s;e heat which prevails dur|ing
the &s;ummer, and the extremity
of cold in winter, I well know has been
a&s;&s;erted to be highly prejudicial to the con|&s;titution;
though for my own part I have
not been &s;en&s;ible of any material inconve|nience
from the oppo&s;ite quality of the
&s;ea&s;ons, but have continued to enjoy un|interrupted
health and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The variations of the weather are cer|tainly
more &s;udden in this part of America,
than even in the changeable climate of Bri|tain.
During one part of the day I have
frequently thought the lighte&s;t apparel
&s;carcely &s;upportable; when in a moment a
north-we&s;t wind has created &s;en&s;ations of
a very different nature, and a &s;ub&s;tantial
<PB N="112" REF="160">
&s;uit of broad cloth has &s;carcely been &s;uffi|cient
to repel the cold.</P>
<P>Whatever you have heard relative to the
rigid puritanical principles and economi|cal
habits of our American brethren, is
by no means true when applied to the in|habitants
of the &s;outhern provinces. Li|berality
of &s;entiment, and genuine ho&s;pi|tality,
are every where prevalent; and I am
per&s;uaded they too frequently mi&s;take pro|fu&s;ene&s;s
for genero&s;ity, and impair their
health and their fortunes, by &s;plendor of
appearance and magnificence of entertain|ments.</P>
<P>The quick importation of fa&s;hions from
the mother country is really a&s;toni&s;hing.
I am almo&s;t inclined to believe, that a new
fa&s;hion is adopted earlier by the poli&s;hed
and affluent American, than by many opu|lent
per&s;ons in the great metropolis; nor
are opportunities wanting to di&s;play &s;upe|rior
elegance. We have varied amu&s;ements,
<PB N="113" REF="161">
and numerous parties, which afford to the
young, the gay, and the ambitious, an ex|ten&s;ive
field to contend in the race of vain
and idle competition. In &s;hort, very little
difference is, in reality, ob&s;ervable in the
manners of the wealthy coloni&s;t and the
wealthy Briton. Good and bad habits pre|vail
on both &s;ides the Atlantic.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that the Ame|rican
ladies po&s;&s;e&s;s a natural ea&s;e and ele|gance
in the whole of their deportment;
and that while they a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivate ex|ternal
accompli&s;hments, they are &s;till anx|iou&s;ly
attentive to the more important em|belli&s;hments
of the mind. In conver&s;ation
they are generally animated, and entertain|ing,
and deliver their &s;entiments with af|fability
and propriety. In a word, there
are, throughout the&s;e colonies, very many
lovely women, who have never pa&s;&s;ed the
bounds of their re&s;pective provinces, and
yet, I am per&s;uaded, might appear to great
<PB N="114" REF="162">
advantage in the mo&s;t brilliant circles of
gaiety and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>In this country the marriage ceremony
is univer&s;ally performed in the dwelling
hou&s;es of the parties. The company, who
are invited, a&s;&s;emble early in the evening,
and after partaking of tea and other re|fre&s;hments,
the indi&s;&s;oluble contract is com|pleted.
The bride and bridegroom then
receive the accu&s;tomed congratulations:
cards and dancing immediately &s;ucceed: an
elegant &s;upper, a cheerful gla&s;s, and the
convivial &s;ong clo&s;e the entertainment.</P>
<P>There are few places where young peo|ple
are more frequently gratified with op|portunities
of a&s;&s;ociating together than in
this country. Be&s;ides our regular a&s;&s;em|blies,
every mark of attention is paid to the
patron Saint of each parent dominion; and
St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, and
St. David, are celebrated with every par|tial
<PB N="115" REF="163">
mark of national attachment. General
invitations are given, and the appearance is
always numerous and &s;plendid.</P>
<P>The Americans on this part of the con|tinent,
have likewi&s;e a Saint, who&s;e hi&s;tory,
like tho&s;e of the above venerable charac|ters,
is lo&s;t in fable and uncertainty. The
fir&s;t of May is, however, &s;et apart to the
memory of Saint Tamina, on which occa|&s;ion
the natives wear a piece of a buck's
tail in their hats, or in &s;ome con&s;picuous
&s;ituation. During the cour&s;e of the even|ing,
and generally in the mid&s;t of a dance,
the company are interrupted by the &s;udden
intru&s;ion of a number of per&s;ons habited
like Indians, who ru&s;h violently into the
room, &s;inging the war &s;ong, giving the
whoop, and dancing in the &s;tile of tho&s;e
people; after which ceremony a collection
is made, and they retire well &s;atisfied with
their reception and entertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="164">
In this province there are &s;carce any ve&s;|tiges
of the original inhabitants, but it
does not appear that their numbers have
been reduced by any inhuman or indirect
practices of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlers. In Dor&s;et
County, on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Maryland,
there are indeed the remains of a nation,
once populous and powerful, who, to this
day, retain con&s;iderable tracts of valuable
land, for which they receive an annual con|&s;ideration,
but by no means equivalent to
the real value. When every other Indian
nation thought it nece&s;&s;ary to retire be|yond
the range of the European &s;ettle|ments,
the&s;e people it &s;eems determined
to continue on their native &s;pot. But
being precluded from their former occu|pations
and pur&s;uits, they became totally
indolent and inactive; and a different habit
of living, a violent propen&s;ity to &s;pirituous
liquors, and the havock occa&s;ioned by the
&s;mall-pox, and other di&s;orders, to which
<PB N="117" REF="165">
they were unaccu&s;tomed, reduced their
numbers to &s;uch a degree, that at this time
not twenty of their de&s;cendants remain.</P>
<P>Since no charge of cruelty can ju&s;tly be
adduced, it becomes a natural enquiry what
is become of tho&s;e numerous tribes that
formerly occupied this fertile territory?</P>
<P>Maryland, comparatively, is a &s;mall pro|vince,
bounded on the we&s;t by the inte|rior
counties of Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania:
the Indians, from their particular mode of
living, require an exten&s;ive circuit, de|pending
principally on hunting for their
&s;upport; and wherever their game becomes
&s;carce, they in&s;tantly quit that country for
a more eligible &s;ituation. As this colony
became populous, by the arrival and natu|ral
increa&s;e of the new adventurers, the
Aborigines were circum&s;cribed in their an|cient
limits, and were con&s;equently in|duced
to relinqui&s;h their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, for a
<PB N="118" REF="166">
&s;uppo&s;ed equivalent, and retire to a more
exten&s;ive field of action.</P>
<P>From what cau&s;e I cannot a&s;certain,
but the North American Indians have ne|ver
yet been known to incorporate with
Europeans; nor has any progre&s;s yet been
made in civilizing their manners, or in re|claiming
them from that ignorance in
which they are univer&s;ally involved. Their
habits appear rooted beyond the po&s;&s;ibility
of conviction to remove; the pre&s;ent mo|ment
engro&s;&s;es every thought, regardle&s;s of
the events of futurity.</P>

<P>IT is true, my friend, that America is
rapidly increa&s;ing in population and im|portance:
but a continent &s;o exten&s;ive
mu&s;t be very thinly inhabited for many
generations. Agriculture mu&s;t, therefore,
be the grand object of colonial attention,
to a very di&s;tant period. While the peo|ple
can be more profitably employed, as
they now are, in clearing and cultivating
land, it will be their intere&s;t to import the
various manufactures of the mother country,
it being evident that every &s;pecies of goods
may be obtained much cheaper, and of a
&s;uperior quality, through the medium of
commercial intercour&s;e, than by any pa|triotic
exertions among&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of the Ameri|can
provinces, there are immen&s;e tracts of
<PB N="120" REF="168">
unappropriated lands. In every govern|ment,
offices are e&s;tabli&s;hed under regal or
proprietary authority, for the purpo&s;e of
granting the &s;ame to adventurers on &s;tipu|lated
terms. As the method of proceeding
in this bu&s;ine&s;s is nearly &s;imilar in every part
of the continent, an account of the mode
adopted with us will give you a general
idea of this matter. Take, therefore,
the following detail, which I have tran|&s;cribed
from an official record, for your
information.</P>
<P>&startq;All papers relating to the granting of
vacant land,&endq; within this province, i&s;&s;ue
out and are recorded in the land office;
and the mode pur&s;ued to effect the grant
of &s;uch vacant lands, is by warrants, either
&s;pecial or common. If the lands are cul|tivated
or improved, they cannot be effected
by any other than a &s;pecial warrant, &s;pe|cifying
the particular location and quan|tity
to be effected. And all &s;uch warrants
<PB N="121" REF="169">
i&s;&s;ue in con&s;equence of an order from the
proprietary's agent, intimating that the
caution money of five pounds &s;terling, <HI>per</HI>
hundred acres, is paid. The warrant is
directed to the &s;urveyor of the county
where the land lies, who makes a &s;urvey,
and returns a certificate thereof into the
land office; from whence it is tran&s;mitted
to the examiner general, and after exami|nation,
it is again &s;ent back to the land-office:
a patent, or grant, then i&s;&s;ues on
the certificate, &s;ubject to the payment of
an annual rent of four &s;hillings &s;terling for
every hundred acres. The fees attending
granting the warrant; of the &s;urvey in
con&s;equence; of the examination of the
certificate; i&s;&s;uing patent thereon; and
affixing the great &s;eal of the province
thereto, will amount to about the &s;um of
&s;even or eight pounds currency, <HI>per</HI> hun|dred
acres.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="170">
&startq;The &s;ame mode is exactly pur&s;ued in
common warrants,&endq; to effect uncultivated
lands, but the expences are rather le&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;It is to be ob&s;erved, the afore&s;aid war|rants
are to effect lands never before taken
up.&endq; There are other warrants that i&s;&s;ue
out of the land-office, &s;uch as warrants of
re-&s;urvey, e&s;cheat warrants, and warrants
under the proclamation.</P>
<P>&startq;The fir&s;t of the&s;e are granted to re-&s;ur|vey
a tract of land,&endq; already patented, and
in which the petitioner has a fee-&s;imple;
and to add all, or any contiguous vacancy,
whether cultivated or otherwi&s;e. This
warrant, as well as all others, mu&s;t be ex|ecuted,
or renewed within the fir&s;t &s;ix
months from the time of granting, other|wi&s;e
they are of no force or effect; and
any vacant land added, if not paid for
within two years from the date of the war|rant,
(agreeable to &s;undry proclamations
publi&s;hed) will become &s;ubject and liable
<PB N="123" REF="171">
to the benefit of the fir&s;t di&s;coverer thereof.
And hence the proclamation warrants take
their ri&s;e, <HI>for they, and no other warrants,</HI>
can legally effect lands thus circum&s;tanced.</P>
<P>&startq;Warrants of E&s;cheat,&endq; are only grant|ed
in in&s;tances where the original paten|tees,
or per&s;ons claiming under them, have
died &s;ei&s;ed in fee, inte&s;tate, and without
heirs, of tracts of land heretofore granted,
with liberty given of effecting, as well &s;uch
original tracts of E&s;cheat, as any vacant
land thereto adjoining. The compo&s;ition
money payable, as in the above ca&s;es; with
this di&s;tinction, that the quality of the
e&s;cheat land, and improvements thereon,
are more particularly de&s;cribed by the &s;ur|veyor,
and from &s;uch de&s;cription the agent,
or receiver-general, a&s;certains the real va|lue
of the land &s;o e&s;cheated. The peti|tioner
is entitled to one third of the full
valuation of the e&s;cheat for the di&s;covery;
and the re&s;idue, together with any vacancy
<PB N="124" REF="172">
added, mu&s;t be paid for, to entitle him to
a grant. The fees and expences inciden|tal
to all the&s;e warrants, are con&s;iderably
more than in primitive &s;urveys, and cannot
be particularly a&s;certained till the whole
bu&s;ine&s;s is compleated.</P>
<P>&startq;By an in&s;truction from the Board of

<P>&startq;The land-office, and all offices re|&s;pecting

a great mea&s;ure, &s;ubject to the control of
the board of revenue, which was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed

<P>The annual revenue of the proprietary,

<P>This influence is con&s;idered by many,
as inimical to the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the

I have before ob&s;erved, that elections in

They have likewi&s;e, individually, power
to determine cau&s;es of the value of forty

<P>The governor has a di&s;cretionary autho|rity

few who do not &s;eem perfectly conver&s;ant

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sep. 7th, 1772.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from an excur&s;ion
to the frontiers of this province, in
which my curio&s;ity was highly gratified.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a more rich
and fertile country than I have lately tra|ver&s;ed;
and when it becomes populous in
proportion to its extent, Frederick County
will, at lea&s;t, be equal to the mo&s;t de&s;ira|ble
e&s;tabli&s;hment on this &s;ide the Atlantic.</P>
<P>In the back &s;ettlements, where the in|habitants
are but thinly &s;cattered, the face
of the country, even at this luxuriant &s;ea|&s;on
of the year, exhibited in many places
a dreary appearance. Lands, to a very
con&s;iderable extent, are taken up by per|&s;ons,
who looking to futurity for greater
advantages, are content to clear gradually
&s;ome portions of their domains for imme|diate
<PB N="130" REF="178">
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Not having the means
to fell, and carry their timber away, they
make a deep inci&s;ion with an axe entirely
round each trunk, at the di&s;tance of about
four feet from the ground, which occa&s;ions
the leaves almo&s;t in&s;tantly to wither; and
before the total decay of the tree, Indian
corn may be cultivated to great advan|tage,
amid&s;t the immen&s;e trunks that fill
the dreary fore&s;t.</P>
<P>To have the idea of winter impre&s;&s;ed on
the mind, from external appearances, at a
time when nature is fainting beneath the
inten&s;e heat of an autumnal &s;un, is, I am
inclined to believe, peculiar to this coun|try.
In &s;ome di&s;tricts, far as the eye could
extend, the leafle&s;s trees of an a&s;toni&s;hing
magnitude crowded on the &s;ight; the creep|ing
ivy only denoting vegetation; at the
&s;ame time, the face of the earth, was covered
with golden crops, which promi&s;ed,
<Q>&startq;Richly to repay the anxious toil.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="179">
The habitations of the planters, in this
remote di&s;trict of the province, are, in ge|neral,
of a rude con&s;truction; the timber
with which they frame their dwellings,
&s;eldom undergoing the operation of any
tool except the axe. An apartment to
&s;leep in, and another for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es,
with a contiguous &s;tore-hou&s;e, and conve|niences
for their live-&s;tock, at pre&s;ent gra|tify
their utmo&s;t ambition. Their me|thod
of living, perfectly corre&s;ponds with
their exterior appearance. Indian corn,
beaten in a mortar, and afterwards baked
or boiled, forms a di&s;h which is the prin|cipal
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the indigent planter,
and is even much liked by many per|&s;ons
of a &s;uperior cla&s;s. This, when pro|perly
prepared, is called <HI>homony,</HI> and when
&s;alt beef, pork, or bacon, is added, no
complaints are made re&s;pecting their fare.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of this province,
fruit is not only plentiful, but excellent in
<PB N="132" REF="180">
various kinds. There are very few planta|tions
unprovided with an apple, and a peach
orchard; the peach trees are all &s;tandards,
and without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, frequently
produce fruit of an exqui&s;ite flavour.</P>
<P>In the woods, I have often met with
vines, twining round trees of different de|nominations;
and have gathered from them
bunches of grapes of a tolerable &s;ize, and
not unplea&s;ant to the palate. In proce&s;s
of time, when the coloni&s;ts are enabled to
pay attention to their natural advantages,
they will, a&s;&s;uredly, po&s;&s;e&s;s all the &s;uper|fluities,
as well as the conveniences of life,
without the nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to fo|reign
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Even &s;ugar, of a tolera|ble
quality, they will be able to manufac|ture
without application to the Briti&s;h
I&s;lands. A planter, at who&s;e hou&s;e
I partook of &s;ome refre&s;hment, pro|duced
a quantity of that capital luxury,
the grain of which was tolerable, and the
<PB N="133" REF="181">
ta&s;te not di&s;agreeable. This, he a&s;&s;ured
me, was the produce of his own po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions,
extracted by inci&s;ion, from a tree,
great numbers of which grow throughout
the interior regions of the American pro|vinces
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Maple-tree.</NOTE>. The &s;imple proce&s;s of boiling,
brought the lu&s;cious liquid to a proper
con&s;i&s;tency; and he was per&s;uaded, when|ever
more important concerns would per|mit
a nece&s;&s;ary attention to this article, the
inhabitants of the Briti&s;h colonies would be
amply &s;upplied from their own inexhau&s;ti|ble
re&s;ources.</P>
<P>About thirty miles we&s;t of Frederick-town,
I pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;ettlement which
is making quick advances to perfection.
A German adventurer, who&s;e name is Ha|gar,
purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable tract of land
in this neighbourhood, and with much
di&s;cernment and fore&s;ight, determined to
<PB N="134" REF="182">
encouragement to traders, and to erect pro|per
habitations for the &s;towage of goods,
for the &s;upply of the adjacent country.
His plan &s;ucceeded: he has lived to be|hold
a multitude of inhabitants on lands,
which he remembered unocupied; and
he has &s;een erected in places, appropriated
by him for that purpo&s;e, more than an
hundred comfortable edifices, to which the
name of Hagar's Town is given, in honour
of the intelligent founder.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Feb. 20, 1773.</DATE></P>
<P>YOUR ob&s;ervations on the re&s;ources
of America are well founded. I
grant they are infinite, and I am per&s;uaded
that, in proce&s;s of time, &s;he will be ena|bled
to avail her&s;elf of innumerable ad|vantages;
but tho&s;e that a&s;&s;ert &s;he will ef|fectually
rival Great Britain in that inva|luable
&s;taple of her commerce, the <HI>woollen
manufactory,</HI> are, indeed, by far too &s;an|guine
in their expectations: coar&s;e cloths
for the wear of &s;ervants and negroes, the
<PB N="140" REF="188">
coloni&s;ts may probably be enabled to ma|nufacture,
but in&s;urmountable objections
ari&s;e to the production of tho&s;e of a &s;upe|rior
quality.</P>
<P>To judge of this climate, by the paral|lel
degrees of latitude in Europe, it is na|tural
to conclude, that the middle pro|vinces
experience very little of the rigour
of winter, and that, in fact, their greate&s;t
inconvenience mu&s;t ari&s;e from inten&s;e heat,
during the &s;ummer months. But, extra|ordinary
as it may appear, this country,
from local circum&s;tances, is accu&s;tomed to
every &s;everity of the oppo&s;ite &s;ea&s;ons. I
a&s;&s;ure you, that I have been le&s;s &s;en&s;ible
of the influence of the &s;un in the hotte&s;t
&s;ea&s;ons in the i&s;land of Jamaica, than in
this part of Briti&s;h America; and I am cre|dibly
informed, that no material difference
prevails from New York inclu&s;ive, to the
&s;outhern extremity of Virginia. To the
northward of New York the winters con|tinue
<PB N="141" REF="189">
longer; the cold is equally inten&s;e;
and the &s;ummer, for its &s;hort duration, hot
in proportion. South of Virginia the cli|mate
gradually becomes &s;imilar to the tor|rid
zone, con&s;equently the wool degene|rates,
in a regular proportion, until the
external covering of the &s;heep becomes at
la&s;t a &s;trong coar&s;e hair re&s;embling that of
goats.</P>
<P>In Maryland, and in the adjacent pro|vinces,
the cold is more &s;evere from Ja|nuary
till the beginning of May, than in
any part of the i&s;land of Great Britain; in
con&s;equence of which the American farmer
is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of hou&s;ing his
&s;heep during that rigid &s;ea&s;on. Summer
may, literally, be &s;aid to be &s;eated on the
lap of winter, and the immediate tran&s;i|tion
from cold to heat is, evidently, ex|tremely
prejudicial to the growth and
improvement of wool; &s;o that in quality
it is greatly inferior; nor is the quantity
<PB N="142" REF="190">
produced proportionable to what is yield|ed
in the milder regions of the parent
&s;tate.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e di&s;advantages it may rea|&s;onably
be concluded, that the American
&s;ettlements will ever be nece&s;&s;itated to look
up to Britain for a very con&s;iderable &s;up|ply
of her invaluable &s;taple. And even if
the&s;e cau&s;es did not operate, many years
mu&s;t unavoidably elap&s;e before the colo|ni&s;ts
can e&s;tabli&s;h or conduct manufactures
in &s;uch a manner, as to enable them to
&s;upply, even their own wants, on terms
of greater advantage than by relying on
external a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This immen&s;e continent will require a
con&s;iderable population before the inhabi|tants
can, with any propriety, divert their
attention from agriculture. To &s;ettle, and
to cultivate lands mu&s;t be their fir&s;t great
object; and the produce of tho&s;e exertions
they mu&s;t barter in exchange for European
<PB N="143" REF="191">
manufactures. In vain is encouragement
held forth, to induce ingenious artizans to
emigrate from their original &s;ituations. On
their arrival, either the allurements which
tempted them deceive their expectations;
or the natural wi&s;h to obtain a perma|nent
e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;upercedes every other
con&s;ideration, and induces a great majority
of the&s;e adventurers to purcha&s;e lands
which, comparatively, bear no price, and
the purcha&s;ers are reduced to rely on time
and indu&s;try to recompence their a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance, very important
in its nature, likewi&s;e demands attention.
The price of labour mu&s;t be greatly le&s;|&s;ened
before the Americans can po&s;&s;ibly
manufacture to any advantage; and this
inconvenience cannot be remedied, until,
by an overplus of people, there are com|petitors
in every art, and a &s;ufficient num|ber
of opulent inhabitants to encourage and
reward their ingenuity.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="192">
At pre&s;ent, it is evident, that almo&s;t
every article of u&s;e or ornament, is to be
obtained on much more rea&s;onable terms
from the mother country, than from arti|zans
&s;ettled on this &s;ide the Atlantic. It
is al&s;o as certain, that goods of every kind
produced, or manufactured in England, are
greatly &s;uperior to the produce or manufac|tures
of this continent. In proce&s;s of time,
but a time far di&s;tant, the colonies may,
undoubtedly, from their great re&s;ources,
be enabled to rival Britain in many valuable
articles of commerce. But in your grand
&s;taple, the growth and manufacture of
wool, you will, in a general point of view,
&s;tand <HI>&s;ingle</HI> and <HI>pre-eminent.</HI> Nature, in this
particular, has been exuberantly bountiful.
Your fertile downs are a &s;ource of inex|hau&s;tible
wealth. Support that &s;uperiority,
which the benevolence of heaven has ble&s;t
you with, by a judicious and indu&s;trious
exertion of local advantages, and the power
<PB N="145" REF="193">
and &s;plendor of Great Britain will defy
the utmo&s;t efforts of oppo&s;ition, and re|main
for ages with undimini&s;hed lu&s;tre!</P>

<P>I THANK you, my dear friend, for
your very entertaining and very de|&s;criptive
detail of the exten&s;ive improve|ments
now carrying forward in the Briti&s;h
metropolis. If I may pre&s;ume to compare
&s;mall things with great, even here we are
making con&s;iderable advances towards per|fection.</P>
<P>About the clo&s;e of the year 1769, an
act of a&s;&s;embly was pa&s;&s;ed to erect a new
<PB N="146" REF="194">
&s;tadt-hou&s;e, on a very enlarged and beau|tiful
plan. This work has been carried
on with great di&s;patch, and, when com|pleted,
will, at lea&s;t, be equal to any pub|lic
edifice on the American continent. The
legi&s;lature of this province, animated by
&s;entiments which reflect the highe&s;t credit
on their patrioti&s;m and wi&s;dom, have al&s;o
determined, by a recent law, to endow and
found a college for the education of youth
in every liberal and u&s;eful branch of &s;ci|ence.
An in&s;titution of this nature was
mo&s;t &s;trongly recommended to their con&s;i|deration
by our worthy governor, at an
early period after his arrival in this coun|try;
and to his laudable and per&s;evering
exertions, the public are materially indebted
for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;eminary which,
as it will be conducted under excellent re|gulations,
will &s;hortly preclude the nece&s;|&s;ity
of cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic for the com|pletion
of a cla&s;&s;ical and polite education.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="195">
During the admini&s;tration of Mr.
B&mdash;, who pre&s;ided over this province
from the year 1742, to the year 1747, a
noble man&s;ion was projected for the re&s;i|dence
of the governor of Maryland. A
delightful &s;ituation was appropriated for
this purpo&s;e on the banks of the Severn,
within the limits of the city of Annapolis,
commanding, in every point of view, the
mo&s;t intere&s;ting and beautiful objects. Ma|terials
of every kind were provided equal
to the &s;pirit of public liberality, and the
building was nearly completed in a &s;tile
of &s;uperior magnificence, when an un|happy
contention took place between the
governor and the delegates of the people,
which increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that,
at a period, when a very trifling &s;um
would have rendered it a noble habi|tation,
the further pro&s;ecution of the
de&s;ign was di&s;continued, and it has re|mained
to this day, a melancholy and
<PB N="148" REF="196">
mouldering monument of the con&s;equences
re&s;ulting from political di&s;&s;entions.</P>
<P>The depredations of time have very
greatly injured the interior parts of this
edifice, which, in an unfini&s;hed &s;tate, has
continued many years, expo&s;ed to every
inclemency of weather. However, on a
late accurate &s;urvey, the out&s;ide &s;tructure,
and the principal timbers, are found in a
condition &s;o perfect, that it is determined
to repair the damages &s;u&s;tained, and to ap|ply
the building to the purpo&s;es of col|legiate
education, for which every cir|cum&s;tance
contributes to render it truly
eligible. The adjacent country is open and
healthy; the contiguous grounds are &s;uffi|ciently
exten&s;ive for the advantages of exer|ci&s;e
and amu&s;ement; and the fabric will
contain a variety of &s;pacious and commo|dious
apartments for the accommodation of
the profe&s;&s;ors and &s;tudents.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="197">
In&s;titutions of this nature are in&s;eparably
connected with the intere&s;t and happine&s;s
of the&s;e provinces; but with re&s;pect to
the parent &s;tate, they may po&s;&s;ibly be at|tended
with &s;erious con&s;equences. When
the real, or &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity cea&s;es of &s;end|ing
the youth of this continent to di&s;tant
&s;eminaries for the completion of their edu|cation,
the attachment of the colonies to
Great Britain will gradually weaken, and a
le&s;s frequent intercour&s;e will tend to encou|rage
tho&s;e &s;entiments of &s;elf-importance
which have already taken too deep root, and
which, I fear, the utmo&s;t exertions of po|litical
wi&s;dom will never be able wholly to
eradicate. As an Engli&s;hman I therefore
cannot but view, with a partial regret,
every adopted plan that may po&s;&s;ibly, in
the event, le&s;&s;en or alienate the affec|tion
of the coloni&s;ts. And though I am
&s;en&s;ible the good of the whole ought to
&s;upercede every private con&s;ideration, yet
<PB N="150" REF="198">
I cannot anticipate the future importance
and pro&s;perity of America, without a mo&s;t
fervent prayer, that every advantage &s;he
may derive from her exertions, may
ultimately depend on a permanent and
con&s;titutional connexion with the mother
country.</P>
<P>To the number of public erections, a
new church is likewi&s;e to be added; the
de&s;ign of which does great credit to the
genius of the architect. It will be large,
neat, and commodious; and is to be built
on the &s;cite of the ancient edifice, from
which many materials will be furni&s;h|ed.
This work is to be executed as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and we may rea&s;onably
expect, if the&s;e different undertakings are
conducted with judgment, and &s;pirit, that
they will be con&s;idered as valuable monu|ments
of that refined ta&s;te, which &s;o re|markably
characteri&s;es the pre&s;ent times.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Nov. 8th, 1773.</DATE></P>
<P>&startq;AS water to a thir&s;ty &s;oul, &s;o is
news from a far country.&endq; Your
circum&s;tantial letter of the fourteenth of
September, afforded me the greate&s;t &s;atis|faction:
I was at once entertained and in|&s;tructed,
by your very judicious and pointed
ob&s;ervations on the pre&s;ent political &s;y&s;tem.
The repeal of the &s;tamp-act, was a wi&s;e
and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure: but on what prin|ciple
&s;ub&s;equent laws have been enacted,
which have evidently the like tendency,
I am at a lo&s;s to determine. Were the
duties to be regularly collected, in con&s;e|quence
of the acts now in force, the reve|nue
ari&s;ing from them, would really be
incon&s;iderable. Nor do the coloni&s;ts ground
their objections on the &s;ums which, by this
<PB N="152" REF="200">
means, would be levied on the importation
of the enumerated articles; but they a&s;&s;ert,
that the principle on which they re&s;i&s;t the
operation of the&s;e laws, is briefly this:
&startq;That they are wholly uncon&s;titutional:
and that to admit their legality in a &s;ingle
in&s;tance, would undoubtedly be to admit
a right, which might be con&s;idered by the
legi&s;lature of Great Britain, as a &s;ufficient
authority to tax them at &s;ome future pe|riod,
in any proportion adequate to the
real, or &s;uppo&s;ed exigencies of the &s;tate.&endq;
How far they are to be ju&s;tified in this opi|nion,
I am not competent to determine;
but it is evident, that on this &s;ide the At|lantic,
a &s;pirit of di&s;content univer&s;ally
prevails; and there are many de&s;ponding
individuals here, and in other provinces,
who already pretend to penetrate &s;o deep
into the events of futurity, as to foretel
the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;From trivial cau&s;e, what mighty evils &s;pring!&endq;</Q>
<PB N="153" REF="201">
For my part, I will not indulge apprehen|&s;ions
of &s;o melancholy a nature.</P>
<P>I have lately received a very &s;en&s;ible,
and very entertaining letter, from my valued
corre&s;pondent, Mi&s;s M&mdash;M&mdash;, who
informs me that her &s;i&s;ter H&mdash;has, at
length, complied with the requi&s;ition of
many judicious and impartial friends, and
has ventured into public notice, in defiance
of critici&s;m. On the 10th of May la&s;t, her
pa&s;toral poem, &startq;THE SEARCH AFTER
HAPPINESS,&endq; made its fir&s;t appearance; and
&s;o rapid has been its &s;ucce&s;s, that a &s;econd
large impre&s;&s;ion took place early in Au|gu&s;t.
Lord Lyttelton, who&s;e refined ta&s;te,
and accurate di&s;cernment, is univer&s;ally ac|knowledge,
has honoured the amiable au|thor
with a letter, expre&s;&s;ive of his warme&s;t
approbation; and the public prints are
unanimous in bearing te&s;timony to her me|rit.
The copy I have received, is in con|tinual
circulation, and indeed, it mu&s;t argue
<PB N="154" REF="202">
a vitiated and depraved judgment in the
reader, not to be charmed with a produc|tion
formed on a plan &s;ub&s;ervient to the
great intere&s;ts of religion and virtue, and
decorated with all the graces and embel|li&s;hments
of poetry.</P>
<P>After paying this ju&s;t tribute to the
talents of a lady who, I tru&s;t, will &s;oon
attain a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in the lite|rary
world, I &s;hall venture to conclude
this letter by the in&s;ertion of an epilogue,
which I wrote a few months &s;ince, at the
reque&s;t of a friend, for the benefit of a
comedian at the theatre in Philadelphia.
As I am informed it was received with
approbation by a numerous audience, I
&s;hall venture, with the greater confidence,
to add this little poetical effu&s;ion to your
manu&s;cript collection.</P>

<P>THE American prints will inform
you, ere you receive this, of the
recent proceedings at Bo&s;ton. The whole
quantity of tea, contained on board three
ve&s;&s;els, amounting to three hundred and
forty-two che&s;ts, was on the 16th of De|cember,
immer&s;ed in the bay. The Ea&s;t
India Company are the only &s;ufferers on
this occa&s;ion; as all accounts perfectly
corre&s;pond in a&s;&s;erting, that this ha&s;ty bu|&s;ine&s;s
was tran&s;acted without the lea&s;t de|triment
<PB N="157" REF="205">
to private property. New York,
Philadelphia, Charles Town, and other places
it is univer&s;ally imagined, will pur&s;ue &s;imilar
mea&s;ures. Va&s;t as this continent is, the
inhabitants appear animated, to a degree of
frenzy, with the &s;ame &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition.
Where the con&s;equences will terminate,
Heaven knows! If a judgment may be
formed from the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the
people, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that not the
lea&s;t future taxation will ever be admitted
here, without what they conceive, a legal
repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>As an Engli&s;hman, warmly attached to
my native country, and anxious for its ho|nour
and pro&s;perity; I view the impend|ing
&s;torm with inexpre&s;&s;ible inquietude. I
fear my friend, our &s;tate&s;men have promoted
mea&s;ures which they will be equally embar|ra&s;&s;ed

The coloni&s;ts are ripe for any mea&s;ures

<P>Re&s;olved, &startq;that it is the unanimous opinion of this meeting,&endq; that the town of Bo&s;ton is now &s;uffering in the common cau&s;e of America, and that it is incumbent on every colony in America, to unite in effectual mea&s;ures to obtain a repeal of the late act of Parliament for block|ing up the harbour of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>&startq;That it is the opinion of this meeting, that if the colonies come into a joint re&s;olution to &s;top all importa|tion from, and exportations to Great Britain, till the &s;aid act be repealed, the &s;ame will pre&s;erve North America, and her liberties.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;That it is the opinion of this meeting,&endq; that the gen|tlemen of the law of this province bring no &s;uit for the recovery of any debt, due from any inhabitant of this pro|vince to any inhabitant of Great Britain, until the &s;aid act be repealed.</P>

and thirty-five per&s;ons<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>TO THE PRINTERS.

<P>A publication of the enclo&s;ed prote&s;t, &s;upported by the names of a con&s;iderable number of the inhabitants of the city of Annapolis, will, it is pre&s;umed, furni&s;h the mo&s;t authentic grounds for determining the &s;en&s;e of the majo|rity, on a que&s;tion of the la&s;t importance.</P>
<P>We who&s;e names are &s;ub&s;cribed, inhabitants of the city of Annapolis, conceive it our clear right, and mo&s;t incumbent duty, to expre&s;s our cordial and explicit di&s;ap|probation of a re&s;olution which was carried by forty-&s;even again&s;t thirty-one, at the meeting held on the 27th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution again&s;t which we prote&s;t, in the face of the world, is the following.</P>
<P>&startq;That it is the opinion of this meeting, that the gen|tlemen of the law of this province, bring no &s;uit for the recovery of any debt, due from any inhabitant of this province, to any inhabitant of Great Britain, until the &s;aid act be repealed.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Di&s;&s;entient.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e we are impre&s;&s;ed with a full convic|tion, that this re&s;olution is founded in treachery and ra&s;h|ne&s;s, in as much as it is big with bankruptcy and ruin to tho&s;e inhabitants of Great Britain, who, relying with unlimited &s;ecurity on our good faith and integrity, have made us ma&s;ters of their fortunes; condemning them <HI>unheard,</HI> for not having interpo&s;ed their influence with parliament in favour of the town of Bo&s;ton, without duly weighing the force, with which that influence would probably have operated; or whether, in their conduct, they were actuated by wi&s;dom and policy, or by <HI>corrup|tion</HI> and <HI>avarice.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e whil&s;t the inhabitants of Great Britain are partially de&s;poiled of every legal remedy to recover what is ju&s;tly due to them, no provi&s;ion is made to prevent us from being harra&s;&s;ed by the pro&s;ecution of internal &s;uits, but our fortunes and per&s;ons are left at the mercy of dome&s;tic creditors, without a po&s;&s;ibility of ex|tricating our&s;elves, unle&s;s by a general convul&s;ion; an event, in the contemplation of &s;ober rea&s;on, replete with horror.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e our credit, as a commercial people, will expire under the wound; for what confidence can po&s;&s;ibly be repo&s;ed in tho&s;e, who &s;hall have exhibited the mo&s;t avowed, and mo&s;t &s;triking proof that they are not bound by obligations as &s;acred as human invention can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>

You will, I doubt not, be
plea&s;ed to &s;ee that I have taken this oppor|tunity
of avowing my &s;entiments on a &s;ub|ject,
which equally affects private reputa|tion
and public faith.</P>
<P>I need not mention, that it is <HI>a particular
re&s;olution</HI> again&s;t which the prote&s;t is le|velled;
the others being of too popular
<PB N="164" REF="212">
a nature to admit of oppo&s;ition. And,
indeed, the generality of tho&s;e who have
ventured to a&s;&s;ert the claims of honour,
to di&s;charge their pecuniary obligations
to the mother country, are con&s;idered, by
the more violent party, as actuated by
&s;entiments inimical to the intere&s;ts of
America: and it is even &s;aid, that they
would combat every attempt to obtain
a repeal of the obnoxious acts, if they
were not apprehen&s;ive of incurring the ju&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="213">
re&s;entment of an injured people. For my

<P>It is here nece&s;&s;ary that I clear up a &s;eem|ing
contradiction. The re&s;olutions in&s;erted
in the Gazette are dated the twenty-fifth:
the prote&s;t alludes to tran&s;actions on the
twenty-&s;eventh. After the publication of
the re&s;olves entered into, in con&s;equence
of the meeting held on the fir&s;t-mentioned
day, &s;everal gentlemen of influence and
re&s;pectability had the courage to declare,
in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms, that if the &s;en|timents
of the people were properly col|lected,
it would not appear that the WHOLE
of the proceedings received their unani|mous
approbation. To obviate this ob|jection,
hand-bills were di&s;tributed, and
a general attendance was earne&s;tly re|que&s;ted;
<PB N="166" REF="214">
in con&s;equence of which, on the
evening of the twenty-&s;eventh, a &s;econd
a&s;&s;embly of the citizens took place. But
in&s;tead of a&s;&s;ociating with that ardor the
zealous partizans expected, ONLY &s;eventy-eight
per&s;ons were mu&s;tered on the im|portant
occa&s;ion. Had the whole number
of tho&s;e who&s;e principles were directed
by moderation, thought it &s;afe, or prudent
to appear in &s;upport of their &s;entiments,
the iniquitous re&s;olution, again&s;t which we
have prote&s;ted, would not have publicly
appeared, to the di&s;credit of our province;
even admitting the conduct of Govern|ment
with re&s;pect to this continent, to
be founded on maxims &s;ubver&s;ive of the
con&s;titution. Surely, in a moral point of
view, it is highly criminal to attempt, by
unju&s;t or indirect methods, to obtain a re|dre&s;s
of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive grievances.</P>
<P>In the&s;e tempe&s;tuous times, your dear

<PB N="167" REF="215">
are there moments, when &s;he yields to bod|ing
apprehen&s;ions, and anticipates the re|newal
of &s;orrows and di&s;appointments. She
has, however, this con&s;olation to &s;upport
her, that whatever &s;ufferings may be our
portion, we &s;hall &s;hare them with each
other.</P>
<P>It is my &s;olemn determination, without
regard to motives of intere&s;t or &s;afety, to act
&s;trictly upon principle. And though <HI>my</HI>
conduct will be of very little importance,
con&s;idered in a <HI>public</HI> point of view, yet
under all the varied circum&s;tances of pro&s;|perity

acted agreeably to the dictates of con&s;cience,
will enhance the advantages of affluence,
or animate the mind to &s;u&s;tain, with be|coming
fortitude, the mo&s;t painful, and
unmerited rever&s;e of fortune.</P>
<P>That the general tranquility may be

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Oct. 26, 1774.</DATE></P>
<P>THE general attention is fixed on the
Congre&s;s now &s;itting in Philadel|phia,
and all de&s;criptions of people are
waiting for the re&s;ult of their deliberations,
with the utmo&s;t impatience.</P>
<P>The Canada Bill is as unpopular here as
the Bo&s;ton Port-bill, and adds greatly to
the univer&s;al di&s;content. The provinces are
unanimous in the cau&s;e of their northern
brethren, and contribute largely in &s;up|plying
their nece&s;&s;ities. The &s;pirit of op|po&s;ition
to mini&s;terial mea&s;ures, appears to
blaze &s;teadily and equally in every part of
Briti&s;h America, and unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy
alteration takes place in the political &s;y&s;|tem,
the con&s;equences mu&s;t inevitably be
dreadful.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="217">
Every well-wi&s;her to the intere&s;t and
happine&s;s of the mother country, and her
colonies, mu&s;t behold this unnatural con|te&s;t
with inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety. There
never was a period in our hi&s;tory, more
critical that the pre&s;ent. It is high time
&s;ome methods were adopted to conciliate
the&s;e growing differences. The colonies
are daily gaining incredible &s;trength. They
<HI>know,</HI> they <HI>feel,</HI> their importance; and
<HI>per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> not <HI>force,</HI> mu&s;t retain them in
obedience.</P>
<P>A general non-importation agreement
will, &s;peedily, take place; and I have rea|&s;on
to believe, will be re&s;olutely adhered to.
It is therefore to be feared, the manufac|turers
and artificers in Britain will be much
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and probably driven to great ex|tremities.
For I need not ob&s;erve to a
man &s;o conver&s;ant as you are with the
commercial intere&s;ts of the empire, how
<PB N="170" REF="218">
&s;everely the mother country mu&s;t &s;uffer
by an interruption of her exten&s;ive trade
with this continent. It is the univer&s;al
doctrine <HI>here,</HI> that it will plunge you into
violent commotions, and probably be at|tended
with fatal con&s;equences<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;eparation of America from Great Britain was contemplated, by per&s;ons of all de&s;criptions, as pregnant with ruin to both countries. It mu&s;t be granted, that in con&s;equence of this event very many de&s;erving individuals have experienced a rever&s;e of fortune which has &s;ubjected them to innumerable difficulties and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es: but in a political point of view, this dreaded revolution has been attended with circum&s;tances highly beneficial to the parent &s;tate. The &s;uperiority of the manufactures of Britain, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed knowledge of her merchants in all the articles e&s;&s;ential for the Ame|rican market, have given them decided advantages over every rival nation. Similarity of language, cu&s;toms, and opinions, likewi&s;e powerfully operate in favours of the mother country; &s;o that, at this period, with every plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of an uninterrupted continuation, Bri|tain &s;upports a more exten&s;ive and a more lucrative commerce with the United States, than at any time during their immediate connexion as a part of her Em|pire.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A &s;erious tran&s;action took place, a few
days &s;ince, in this city. The affair is par|tially
<PB N="171" REF="219">
repre&s;ented in the Maryland Gazette.
I attended the whole progre&s;s of the bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and was active in my exertions to
prevent the extremities to which &s;ome
frantic zealots proceeded.</P>
<P>On Saturday the fifteenth in&s;tant, the
brig Peggy, Stewart, arrived from London
with &s;ervants, and an incon&s;iderable quan|tity
of goods, among which were &s;even|teen
packages, containing two thou&s;and,
three hundred, and twenty pounds of tea,
con&s;igned to Thomas Charles Williams and
company, merchants, in Annapolis. This
intended importation was immediately di&s;|covered,
and the citizens were &s;ummoned
to a general meeting. On examination it
appeared, that Me&s;&s;rs. Williams had, on
this occa&s;ion, imported a larger quantity
of that dete&s;table plant, as it is here term|ed,
than by any former opportunity; and
that Mr. Anthony Stewart, the proprietor
<PB N="172" REF="220">
of the ve&s;&s;el, had paid the duties thereon;
though he was not, in any &s;hape, concern|ed
in the property. This was deemed a
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the conte&s;ted claim of the
Briti&s;h Parliament. Very &s;evere cen&s;ures
were accordingly pa&s;&s;ed on the parties con|cerned,
and a general &s;pirit of re&s;entment
appeared to predominate. After various
modes of proceeding had been propo&s;ed,
and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it was determined to appoint
a committee to attend the ve&s;&s;el, and pre|vent
the landing of the tea, until the &s;en&s;e
of the county could be fully collected.
The en&s;uing Wedne&s;day was appointed for
that purpo&s;e, and proper mea&s;ures were
pur&s;ued to give the nece&s;&s;ary information.</P>
<P>Mr. Stewart, apprehen&s;ive of the con|&s;equences
likely to en&s;ue, with great pro|priety
&s;olicited a previous meeting of the
citizens on the following Monday; tru&s;t|ing
that, by a timely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, mea&s;ures
<PB N="173" REF="221">
might be taken to prevent the a&s;&s;embling
of &s;o numerous a body as were expected to
come in from the country; from whom
he had much to fear with re&s;pect to his
per&s;on and his property.</P>
<P>At this meeting it was propo&s;ed, by the
moderate party, that Me&s;&s;rs. Stewart and
Williams, who were de&s;irous to make
atonement for the offence they had com|mitted,
might be permitted to land and
burn the tea, in any place that &s;hould be
appointed for that purpo&s;e. This motion
was, however, &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by others,
who in&s;i&s;ted on matters remaining as they
were, until the time appointed for the
county meeting, in order that a more pub|lic
acknowledgment and &s;atisfaction might
be made.</P>
<P>Mr. Stewart, with a view to moderate
the re&s;entment which his conduct had un|happily
occa&s;ioned, di&s;tributed the follow|ing
<PB N="174" REF="222">
hand-bill and affidavit, which were
al&s;o publicly read; but without any appa|rent
effect in his favour.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;To the Gentlemen of the Committee,&endq;
the Citizens of Annapolis, and the In|habitants
of Ann Arundel County.
&startq;Gentlemen,&endq;</OPENER>
<P>&startq;I find by a hand-bill,&endq; that you are
reque&s;ted to meet to take into con&s;ideration
what is proper to be done with the tea,
the property of Thomas C. Williams and
Co. now on board the brig Peggy, Stewart,
and finding my conduct cen&s;ured for hav|ing
paid the duty on that tea to the col|lector,
I take the liberty to pre&s;ent a plain
narrative of the part I have acted therein,
and the motives by which I was actuated.
Deeply intere&s;ted as I am in the peace and
harmony of this country, no man would
be farther than my&s;elf from taking any
<PB N="175" REF="223">
&s;teps to di&s;turb them. I am not in the
lea&s;t connected with any thing that relates
merely to the importation; indeed &s;o cau|tious
have I been of infringing in the lea&s;t,
any of the re&s;olutions of America, that I
did not order a &s;ingle farthing's worth of
goods by that ve&s;&s;el, though I could have
done it on &s;uch ea&s;y terms as to freight,
and &s;hipping charges; much le&s;s &s;hould
I have thought of ordering any tea, after
the di&s;turbance which the importation of
that article had occa&s;ioned on the conti|nent.
When the brig arrived, the captain
informed me &s;he was very leaky, and that
the &s;ooner &s;he was unloaded the better.
I told him to enter his ve&s;&s;el, but not the
tea, which I found, on enquiry of the
collector, could not be done. Under the&s;e
circum&s;tances, the brig leaky, and fifty-three
&s;ouls on board, where they had been
near three months, I thought my&s;elf bound,
both in humanity and prudence, to enter
<PB N="176" REF="224">
the ve&s;&s;el, and leave the de&s;tination of the
tea to the committee. The impropriety of
&s;ecuring the duty did not then occur to me,
neither did I know the tea would be &s;uf|fered
to be lodged as a &s;ecurity for the pay|ment.
I had nothing in view but to &s;ave
the ve&s;&s;el from a &s;eizure, and of having
an opportunity of relea&s;ing the pa&s;&s;engers
from a long and di&s;agreeable confinement.
The duty on tea has been paid hitherto,
both in Virginia and Maryland, by every
importer of goods: in this ca&s;e I am not
the importer. If I have erred in my part
of the tran&s;action, I declare, upon my
honour, it is without the lea&s;t intention;
I have infringed no rules pre&s;cribed by the
general re&s;olutions of this province. It
happened unluckily, that the tea was put
on board of Captain Jack&s;on's brig, in the
manner as will be &s;een by the annexed af|fidavit;
and it can be inconte&s;tibly proved,
the captain refu&s;ed taking tea on board:</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="225">
Mr. Williams was in London when the
tea was &s;hipped, and mu&s;t have known
that many merchants had refu&s;ed to &s;hip
that article. I have only to add, that I
am &s;incerely &s;orry my conduct, on this
occa&s;ion, has been the cau&s;e of &s;o much
unea&s;ine&s;s, and freely &s;ubmit it to your
candid con&s;ideration.</P>

<P>Captain Richard Jack&s;on, ma&s;ter of the
brig Peggy Stewart, depo&s;eth and &s;aith,
&startq;That immediately after the landing of
his cargo in London, he applied for, and
obtained a <HI>general</HI> permit from the Cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e,
to receive <HI>India and other
goods</HI> on board for exportation; and, (as
is always cu&s;tomary in &s;uch ca&s;es) gave
<PB N="178" REF="226">
&s;ecurity, and took an oath not to re|land
the &s;ame in any part of Great Bri|tain.
But having great rea&s;on to be|lieve
any importation of tea would be
unfavourably received in America, he
was fully determined, and had re&s;olved
not to receive any on board; and pub|lickly
on the Change of London, in the
month of July, refu&s;ed to receive tea,
which was offered to be &s;hipped by Kel|ly,
Lott, and Co. This deponent fur|ther
&s;aith, that by the method of &s;hip|ping
goods from London, <HI>tea</HI> may be
put on board any &s;hip, without the
knowledge of the ma&s;ter. All goods
are examined at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and
&s;ent, by the &s;hipper, in lighters, on
board the &s;hip, with only a common
bill expre&s;&s;ing the parcels, and not the
quantities contained, or the qualities of
them; the&s;e are received by the mate
of the &s;hip, who gives a receipt on the
<PB N="179" REF="227">
lighter-bill, which is again returned to
the &s;hipper, and the ma&s;ter &s;igns his bills
of lading <HI>at London,</HI> by the lighter-bill,
&s;pecifying the parcels, without know|ing
the contents, and clears out the &s;hip
at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e with merchandize,
without knowing or mentioning of what
nature. The cockets containing the
particulars of each parcel, are &s;ent by
the officers of the cu&s;toms at London,
to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e at Grave&s;end, and
there lodged to be called for by the cap|tain
or ma&s;ter of the &s;hip on his pa&s;&s;age
to &s;ea. In this manner the goods &s;hip|ped
in the Peggy Stewart, were received
on board: And this deponent further
&s;aith, that he &s;aw Thomas Charles Wil|liams,
to whom the tea is con&s;igned,
and Amos Hayton, who &s;hipped the
&s;ame, frequently in London, neither of
whom ever mentioned to him their in|tention
of &s;hipping any: That he did
<PB N="180" REF="228">
not know of any tea being on board,
until after he had received his cockets
at Grave&s;end, and that he would not
have received the &s;ame had he known
thereof.&endq;</P>

<P>Mr. S&mdash;, on account of what was
deemed a cheerful and ready compliance
with an uncon&s;titutional act of the Briti&s;h
legi&s;lature, was particularly obnoxious: and
though he publicly read his recantation,
expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and peni|tential
terms, there were frantic zealots
among the multitude, who warmly pro|po&s;ed
the American di&s;cipline of tarring and
feathering. Others, with a le&s;s vindictive
&s;pirit, were clamorous for the de&s;truction
of the brig, which had imported the hate|ful
commodity: whil&s;t many others, who
indeed were the more numerous party, can|didly
declared, &startq;that the paper &s;igned by
the offenders, with their unextorted con|&s;ent
<PB N="183" REF="231">
to burn the tea, was a &s;ufficient pu|ni&s;hment,
and &s;atisfaction.&endq; But to de|termine
this point with certainty, it was
propo&s;ed and a&s;&s;ented to, that a divi&s;ion
&s;hould take place on the following que&s;tion:
&startq;Whether the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould, or &s;hould
not be de&s;troyed?&endq; when it was carried
in the negative by a con&s;iderable majority;
the citizens, in general, appearing aver&s;e to
violent mea&s;ures. But as the minority were
chiefly per&s;ons who re&s;ided at a di&s;tance
from Annapolis; as &s;ome of them had
great influence in their neighbourhood;
and intimated a determined re&s;olution to
proceed to the utmo&s;t extremities, the in|&s;tant
they could collect &s;ufficient numbers
to &s;upport them, Mr. Stewart was induced,
from an anxious de&s;ire to pre&s;erve the pub|lic
tranquillity, as well as to en&s;ure his own
per&s;onal &s;afety, to propo&s;e &s;etting fire him|&s;elf
to the ve&s;&s;el; which being immedi|ately
a&s;&s;ented to, he in&s;tantly repaired on
<PB N="184" REF="232">
board, accompanied by &s;everal gentlemen
who thought it nece&s;&s;ary to attend him,
and having directed her to be run on
ground, near the wind-mill point, he made
a &s;acrifice of his valuable property to intem|perate
zeal and clamour; and in a few hours
the brig, with her &s;ails, cordage, and every
appurtenance, was effectually burnt.</P>
<P>By comparing the foregoing account with
the circum&s;tances &s;tated in the Maryland
Gazette, a manife&s;t difference appears.
Every &s;tep that Me&s;&s;rs. Stewart and Wil|liams
took in this tran&s;action, to the pre|judice
of their property, &s;eems, in that
publication, to proceed from a voluntary
election, unawed and unintimidated by the
multitude: but I need not comment on
the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an opinion. The
truth is, they de&s;troyed property of great
value, to prevent wor&s;e con&s;equences.</P>

<P>The Congre&s;s have concluded their de|liberations.
I have &s;een their re&s;olves;
the a&s;&s;ociation; the petition to his ma|je&s;ty;
and the addre&s;&s;es to Great Britain, to
Canada, and to the confederating Ameri|can
colonies.</P>
<P>The petition to the king is not to be
publi&s;hed on this &s;ide the water, until
advice is received of its delivery at St.
James's. It was &s;ent home from Phila|delphia,
by a &s;hip, which by this time, is,
probably, far on its way. God knows
what influence the&s;e papers may have in
England. If they are &s;upported by truth,
may they produce effects to the mutual
advantage of all parties! The petition is
held to be a ma&s;terly performance; firm,
explicit, and re&s;pectful: the Addre&s;s to
Great Britain is thought to be pathetic and
per&s;ua&s;ive; that to Canada, to be founded
<PB N="186" REF="234">
on &s;entiments of liberty and rea&s;on; and
that to the uniting provinces, to be in&s;truc|tive
and moderating. I have peru&s;ed them
with impartial attention, but am not com|petent
to determine on their re&s;pective
merits. It is evident the coloni&s;ts are
unanimous, and will &s;teadily &s;upport the
proceedings of their delegates. Our
printer is clo&s;ely engaged at the pre&s;s: the
whole will make a tolerable pamphlet; and
&s;hould the publication take place before
this packet is di&s;patched, I &s;hall forward it
by the &s;ame conveyance.</P>
<P>I do not imagine the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of
affairs will materially affect you; at lea&s;t
for &s;ome time: but I and mine are al|ready
too &s;en&s;ible of the evils attending
the conte&s;t. My income is now con&s;i|derably
reduced; trade is already at a
&s;tand; and on the 1&s;t of December, a ge|neral
<PB N="187" REF="235">
non-importation takes place. Com|modities
of every kind are, at this early
period, become &s;carce and dear. Neither
money, or bills can be found; and few peo|ple
are &s;ufficiently provided to an&s;wer the
purpo&s;es of their nece&s;&s;ary expenditure.
Amid&s;t every &s;uffering, the reflection that
thou&s;ands of indu&s;trious manufacturers at
home, mu&s;t take their proportion of the
impending calamity, gives infinite di&s;qui|etude
to every hone&s;t and feeling mind.</P>

<P>THERE is but too much rea&s;on to|apprehend
that the hour is approach|ing
when even the intercour&s;e of letters
will be greatly interrupted, if not totally
prohibited.</P>
<P>From one extremity of this continent
to the other, every appearance indicates
approaching ho&s;tilities. The bu&s;y voice
of preparation echoes through every &s;et|tlement;
and tho&s;e who are not zealou&s;ly
infected with the general frenzy, are
con&s;idered as enemies to the cau&s;e of li|berty;
and, without regard to any peculi|arity
of &s;ituation, are branded with oppro|brious
appellations, and pointed out as vic|tims
to public re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="238">
Very con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;criptions have been
made in every quarter, for the relief of the
Bo&s;tonians: large &s;ums have likewi&s;e been
collected for the purcha&s;e of arms and am|munition,
and per&s;ons of all denominations
are required to a&s;&s;ociate under military re|gulations,
on pain of the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure;
every mea&s;ure, while tending to the mo&s;t
fatal con&s;equences, is eagerly and wildly
pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Admitting the evils complained of to be
founded on reality, the mode adopted to
obtain redre&s;s cannot, in my opinion, be
ju&s;tified on principles of rea&s;on or &s;ound
policy. I have, therefore, refu&s;ed to join
in any of the propo&s;ed contributions;
to appears in any of their a&s;&s;ociations; or to
enrol in any military corps. I have even
attempted to moderate the enthu&s;ia&s;m of
intemperate zeal, by the following appeal
to Common Sen&s;e and Common Equity;
which, through the medium of the Mary|land

<HEAD>&startq;TO THE PRINTERS.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>&startq;The pre&s;ent unhappy contention be|tween
the <HI>mother country</HI> and her <HI>colonies,</HI>&endq;
is a matter of the deepe&s;t concern to every
hone&s;t, every feeling mind: it is, there|fore,
the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of every friend
to &s;ociety, to &s;tudy and to pur&s;ue tho&s;e
methods, which may lead to a perfect re|conciliation,
and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a
permanent union between <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;The principle of <HI>parliamentary taxation</HI>
over this exten&s;ive part of the empire,&endq; is
<PB N="192" REF="240">
generally denied by all ranks, and denomi|nations
of men; the grand &s;ubject of con|trover&s;y,
therefore, that prevails at pre|&s;ent,
re&s;pects <HI>the mo&s;t eligible method to
obtain redre&s;s.</HI> On this point, there ap|pears
a divi&s;ion of &s;entiment, which has
given ri&s;e to <HI>heart-burnings and di&s;content;</HI>
and, in &s;ome degree, &s;truck at the root of
that harmony which, at this important
period, ought to <HI>guide</HI> and <HI>influence</HI> every
action.</P>
<P>&startq;In oppo&s;ition to mea&s;ures dictated by
<HI>calmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>moderation,</HI>&endq; (a &s;teady adherence
to which, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed, would
be attended with the mo&s;t happy effects)
<HI>a military appearance</HI> is a&s;&s;umed&mdash;<HI>&s;ub&s;crip|tions</HI>
are indu&s;triou&s;ly making for the pur|cha&s;e
of <HI>arms, ammunition,</HI> &amp;c. and the
<HI>&s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure</HI> is indi&s;criminately pa&s;&s;ed on
tho&s;e per&s;on who happen to di&s;&s;ent from
the popular opinion, and prefer more con|ciliating
methods of accommodation.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="241">
&startq;It is certain that there are many in <HI>this,</HI>&endq;
and other <HI>provinces,</HI> who object to the
&s;pirit of violence, which &s;eems at this
time too predominant. Convinced of the
propriety of their &s;entiments, and the in|tegrity
of their hearts, they conceive the
cau&s;e of America may be <HI>totally injured</HI> by
a precipitate, and unnece&s;&s;ary defiance of
the power of Great Britain: they firmly
believe, that a re&s;pectful behaviour to their
<HI>&s;overeign</HI> and their <HI>mother country</HI>&mdash;a du|tiful
and con&s;titutional application to the
<HI>throne</HI>&mdash;and a firm per&s;everance in <HI>virtuous,</HI>
though <HI>pacific principles,</HI> will, in the i&s;&s;ue,
be productive of the mo&s;t felicitous con&s;e|quences.
Actuated by &s;uch con&s;iderations,
they cannot be reconciled to tho&s;e violent
extremes which have been too ra&s;hly
adopted by many; and which they are
anxious to e&s;tabli&s;h, as the <HI>only</HI> fea&s;ible
plan of terminating the pre&s;ent di&s;&s;en&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="242">
&startq;On deliberate reflection,&endq; it can hardly
be imagined, that the mother country has
formed the lea&s;t intention of reducing the&s;e
provinces to a &s;tate of abject &s;ervility, by
the force of arms; the <HI>natural connexion</HI>&mdash;
the <HI>clo&s;e ties</HI>&mdash;and <HI>nice dependencies,</HI> which
exi&s;t between the different parts of the
empire, forbid indulging any conclu&s;ions
of &s;o melancholy a nature. She will be
more ju&s;t&mdash;more tender to her offspring&mdash;
the voice of rea&s;on will prevail&mdash;our griev|ances
will be redre&s;&s;ed&mdash;and &s;he will be
found, <HI>to the end of time,</HI> a kind&mdash;a fo&s;|tering
parent!&mdash;But admitting that Great
Britain were determined to enforce a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to all her mandates; even in that
ca&s;e, we have little cau&s;e to apprehend,
that &s;he will <HI>un&s;heath the &s;word,</HI> and e&s;ta|bli&s;h
her decrees in <HI>the blood of thou&s;ands.</HI>
A more &s;afe and certain method is obvious:
a &s;mall proportion of <HI>her naval power</HI> would
entirely &s;hut up our harbours&mdash;&s;u&s;pend our
<PB N="195" REF="243">
trade&mdash;impoveri&s;h the inhabitants&mdash;pro|mote
inte&s;tine divi&s;ions&mdash;and involve us in
all the horrors of anarchy and confu&s;ion.
To avoid evils, <HI>even great as the&s;e,</HI> we are
not meanly to bend the neck, and &s;ubmit
to every innovation. But when there is
no pro&s;pect of &s;uch dreadful calamities,
why are we to form ideas of <HI>battles</HI> and of
<HI>&s;laughter?</HI> Why are our coa&s;ts to re&s;ound
with <HI>ho&s;tile preparations?</HI>&mdash;the demon of
<HI>di&s;cord</HI> to &s;talk at large&mdash;and <HI>friends</HI> and
<HI>kindred</HI> forget the peaceful bonds of <HI>amity</HI>
and <HI>love?</HI></P>
<P>&startq;It has been objected by the advocates
for moderation,&endq; that the methods pur&s;ued
to complete the &s;ub&s;cription for arms, &amp;c.
has more the complexion of <HI>an arbitrary
tax,</HI> than <HI>a voluntary contribution.</HI> On
the other hand, it has been a&s;&s;erted, &startq;that
money rai&s;ed in a manner,&endq; where there
is no obligation to pay but a &s;en&s;e of duty;
<PB N="196" REF="244">
and no other mode to induce compliance,
but &s;hame and infamy, cannot be deemed
<HI>a tax.</HI> A &s;en&s;e of duty is, undoubtedly,
the mo&s;t noble incentive to <HI>worthy actions;</HI>
but a fal&s;e dread of <HI>&s;hame</HI> and <HI>infamy,</HI> has
perverted many <HI>an hone&s;t heart,</HI> and too fre|quently
proved an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to
<HI>di&s;honourable practices.</HI> Let us a moment
reflect:&mdash;Can there be an impo&s;ition more
arbitrary and &s;evere, than a nece&s;&s;ity of
a&s;&s;enting to any particular mea&s;ure, or for|feiting
<HI>that fair</HI>&mdash;that <HI>un&s;ullied reputation,</HI>
which alleviates the cares of life, and
&s;mooths the inevitable rugged path to the
dreary man&s;ions of the grave!</P>

<P><PB N="199" REF="247">
On peru&s;ing the above humble effort of
my pen, it will readily occur to you, that
if I had, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, ad|mitted
the right of parliamentary taxation,
my addre&s;s, in times like the&s;e, could not
po&s;&s;ibly have been productive of any &s;alu|tary
con&s;equences. The denial of that
right being the prevailing creed of the co|lonies,
I found my&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to co|incide
with the popular opinion, that I
might &s;trike, with the greater efficacy, at
that vindictive, arbitrary &s;y&s;tem, which
under the fallacious pretence of &s;upport|ing
the intere&s;ts of con&s;titutional freedom,
exerts a tyrannical authority, in order to
enforce ho&s;tile oppo&s;ition in preference to
moderate and re&s;pectful applications.</P>
<P>How far the legi&s;lative authority of
Great Britain legally extends over the
American Provinces, is beyond the extent
of my limited abilities to determine. In
<PB N="200" REF="248">
the confidence of conver&s;ation, I daily
hear various opinions, &s;upported by &s;trength
of argument and accuracy of ob&s;ervation,
and from what I have heard, and am en|abled
to judge, I am clearly convinced
that much more is apprehended than
has any exi&s;tence in reality. But in all
countries there are bu&s;y, turbulent &s;pirits,
who from motives of ambition, avarice,
or di&s;content, &startq;infect the general ear with
horrid &s;peech:&endq; by eagerly pre&s;&s;ing for|wards,
as champions in the public cau&s;e,
they agitate the pa&s;&s;ions of the mi&s;guided
multitude, and imperceptibly lead them to
the mo&s;t dreadful extremities.</P>
<P>It is with plea&s;ure I am able to a&s;&s;ert,
that a greater degree of moderation appears
to predominate in this province, than in
any other on the continent; and I am
perfectly a&s;&s;ured we are very materially in|debted
for this peculiar advantage to the
<PB N="201" REF="249">
collected and con&s;i&s;tent conduct of our
Governor, who&s;e views appear &s;olely di|rected
to advance the intere&s;ts of the com|munity;
and to pre&s;erve, by every po&s;&s;ible
method, the public tranquillity. How
long we may continue thus di&s;tingui&s;hed,
time alone mu&s;t determine. Should our
demagogues obtain the a&s;cendency, after
which they labour, we &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly equal
any of our neighbours in tho&s;e violences
of which we now only contemplate the
commencement.</P>
<P>While the power of communicating my

I &s;hall not fail to give you due in|formation
of every material circum&s;tance.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, Wedne&s;day Even. <DATE>April 26, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>ABOUT noon this day, arrived an
expre&s;s from Bo&s;ton, which brought
an account, &startq;that on the 19th in&s;tant
a detachment of the king's troops, con|&s;i&s;ting
of about a thou&s;and men, being
ordered on &s;ome &s;ecret duty, at a place
called Lexington, fell in with a company
of provincials, whom they attacked with|out
any provocation, killed &s;ix, and wound|ed
four: that on an alarm being given,
the regulars were, in con&s;equence, a&s;&s;ault|ed
by a numerous body of the militia, who
had &s;urrounded them; and it was &s;up|po&s;ed
the conflict would be de&s;perate and
bloody.&endq;</P>
<P>An additional paragraph &s;ays, &startq;that
General Gage had &s;ent a reinforcement,
<PB N="203" REF="251">
with &s;ome artillery, to &s;u&s;tain the troops;
but that mea&s;ures were taken to prevent
their junction: that when the expre&s;s was
di&s;patched, about one hundred and fifty
&s;oldiers were killed, and about fifty New
Englandmen; and that the engagement
continued with determined re&s;olution.&endq;</P>
<P>With the mo&s;t dreadful anxiety are we
now waiting for further, and more circum|&s;tantial
intelligence.</P>
<P>The la&s;t advices from London intimate,
that both Hou&s;es of Parliament have ad|dre&s;&s;ed
his Maje&s;ty, reque&s;ting him to en|force
the acts; and that it has been de|termined,
in con&s;equence, to increa&s;e the
army already in America.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, this intelligence
has brought on the commencement of ho&s;|tilities;
the violent party having conceiv|ed
the practica$ility of reducing General
<PB N="204" REF="252">
Gage, before he is rendered more formid|able
by the fre&s;h &s;upplies. Should the
event be an&s;werable to their expectation,
the mea&s;ure will be applauded by very many
of the ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate. If they fail,
the di&s;appointment may, probably, give
encouragement to the cool and moderate
throughout the different provinces, to exert
their influence and their abilities, in order
to prevent the continent, in general, from
participating in the mi&s;eries of war!</P>
<P>The Provincial Convention are now &s;it|ting
in Annapolis, but &s;trangers are not
permitted to attend their debates. They
have already di&s;patched an expre&s;s to the

from Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The plan propo&s;ed for a reconcilia|tion,
by Lord North, is generally ap|proved
by the moderate and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate,
as the foundation of a permanent tran|quility<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>On the motives and conduct of the American war there are various opinions, but only <HI>one</HI> exi&s;ts with re|&s;pect to the zeal evinced by the above nobleman, in behalf of tho&s;e who had freely &s;acrificed their all to their loyalty, and to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The writer of the&s;e letters would be greatly wanting in gratitude, were he not happy in this opportunity, of acknowledging his particular obligations to the Earl of Guilford. At the time of his arrival in England, his Lord&s;hip was at the head of the Trea&s;ury, to whom he &s;tated tho&s;e circum&s;tances which had compelled him to abandon his very eligible &s;ituations in the province of Maryland. The facts being properly authenticated, his Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed, without the <HI>mo&s;t di&s;tant</HI> interfe|rence of private intere&s;t, and with a di&s;patch beyond the author's mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, to allot him a tem|porary provi&s;ion, which enabled him to &s;upport, with comfort, that rever&s;e of fortune, which had rendered him dependent on the ju&s;tice and humanity of his country.</P></NOTE>.

<P>La&s;t night advice was received from Vir|ginia,
that the powder and &s;tores in the
magazine at William&s;burg, were taken
from thence by &s;ome marines belonging
to one of his Maje&s;ty's ve&s;&s;els on that &s;ta|tion,
by order of his Excellency Lord
Dunmore.</P>
<P>This intelligence has given an additi|onal
alarm to our patriotic party; and ac|cordingly
&s;ome gentlemen were deputed
by the convention to wait on the gover|nor;
&s;oliciting him to give directions, that
the arms, powder, and &s;tores, belonging

<P>The deputation was received with
re&s;pect, and the governor promi&s;ed to
con&s;ult his council with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch.

are departed quietly to their habitations.</P>

<P>To prevent riot and confu&s;ion, the go|vernor

to comply with the requi&s;ition of
the convention, on condition that the co|lonels
of the militia, in the re&s;pective coun|ties
under the ancient e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;o|licit
for the delivery of the arms, powder
and &s;tores, pointing out the nece&s;&s;ity of
the mea&s;ure. By this mode of proceed|ing,
the dignity of government is main|tained,
<PB N="208" REF="256">

<P>The inhabitants of New York have hi|therto
di&s;covered &s;entiments favourable to
government: but if the &s;word is un&s;heath|ed,
it is apprehended they will almo&s;t unani|mou&s;ly
fall into the ranks of oppo&s;ition. A
report is circulated, that fourteen regiments
are ordered to that city, who are to pre|vent
all communication between the &s;outh|ern

of this rumour, their commi$tee of ob&s;erva|tion

Maryland, Virginia, and other places,
de&s;iring immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould &s;uch an

are e&s;tabli&s;hed, under the appellation
of committees; in every one of which a
few de&s;pots lord it over the calm and mo|derate;
inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the mob,
and pronounce tho&s;e to be enemies to the
general good, who may pre&s;ume any way
to di&s;&s;ent from the creed they have thought
proper to impo&s;e.</P>
<P>Our provincial convention ro&s;e this day;
and, con&s;idering the complexion of the
times, their proceedings have been regular
<PB N="211" REF="259">
and moderate. The eleventh in&s;tant is to
be ob&s;erved as a fa&s;t throughout this pro|vince:
the mu&s;tering is to be continued;
and a &s;um is to be rai&s;ed in each county,
for the &s;upport of the delegates in Phila|delphia.</P>
<P>From the public prints it is difficult to
form a clear idea of the prevailing opinion
at home, re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent unhappy
and unnatural contention. If determined
mea&s;ures are pur&s;ued, under officers of ap|proved
tru&s;t and ability, it can hardly be
imagined that the colonies will be equal to
a long and &s;erious oppo&s;ition; but whe|ther
a reduction of them by force would
be attended with the de&s;ired con&s;equences,
is a que&s;tion that ought to be con&s;idered in
preference to every other object. It will
&s;urely be advi&s;eable on the part of the Bri|ti&s;h
commanders, to act only on defen&s;ive
principles, until every lenient method has
<PB N="212" REF="260">
been adopted to re&s;tore harmony and mu|tual
confidence on a con&s;titutional founda|tion.
It is evident there are too many in|dividuals,
in every province, who, from
intere&s;ted or ambitious motives, embrace
all opportunities to foment the &s;eeds of di|vi&s;ion,
by inflammatory addre&s;&s;es to the
pa&s;&s;ions of the multitude, by repeated mi&s;|repre&s;entations,
and by artfully delineating
the mi&s;eries of that arbitrary &s;y&s;tem which
they a&s;&s;ert, will be the inevitable con&s;e|quence
of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to mini&s;terial man|dates.
Yet there are, al&s;o, throughout
this continent, many re&s;pectable charac|ters,
who&s;e real importance and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
reputation, give them &s;uch due weight
and influence, that I cannot but indulge
the plea&s;ing idea they will, by the &s;teadi|ne&s;s
and con&s;i&s;tency of their conduct, be
able to &s;tem the torrent excited by fac|tious
artifices, and to forward mea&s;ures
that may be e&s;&s;ential to the intere&s;ts
<PB N="213" REF="261">
and happine&s;s of the united Briti&s;h Em|pire.</P>
<P>Supported by this hope, tho&s;e who are
&s;incerely attached to the pro&s;perity and
welfare of the general community, direct
their be&s;t attention to the parent &s;tate.
Under the evils that now oppre&s;s them,
they derive &s;ome con&s;olation from a firm
per&s;ua&s;ion, that the olive-branch will
&s;peedily be extended, and that &s;uch wi&s;e
and judicious di&s;po&s;itions will be made
for future legi&s;lation in the colonies; that
many ine&s;timable advantages will ari&s;e from
pa&s;t and pre&s;ent calamities.</P>
<P><DATE>May 13.</DATE></P>
<P>At length we have received General
Gage's account of the late action, which
is materially different from tho&s;e tran&s;mit|ted
by the re&s;pective committees; and, I
<PB N="214" REF="262">
think, may be more certainly relied on,
being written ten days after the engage|ment,
when the particulars relative to the
whole tran&s;action were properly and mi|nutely
collected. The charge of cruelty
and precipitation is now retorted on the
provincials. But the patriots yield no
credit to this relation; though they affect
to believe implicitly every report propa|gated
to the di&s;advantage of the Briti&s;h
forces.</P>
<P>The Members of the Congre&s;s are now
a&s;&s;embled in Philadelphia. I need not &s;ay
with what anxiety we attend the event of
their deliberations. The governor con|tinues
to &s;tand fair with the people of this
province; our public prints declare him to
be the only per&s;on, in his &s;tation, who, in
the&s;e tumultuous times, has given admi|ni&s;tration
a fair and impartial repre&s;enta|tion
of important occurrences; and I can
<PB N="215" REF="263">
a&s;&s;ert with the &s;tricte&s;t regard to truth,
that he conducts him&s;elf, in his arduous
department, with an invariable attention to
the intere&s;ts of his royal ma&s;ter, and the
e&s;&s;ential welfare of the province over which
he has the honour to pre&s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>July 25, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>MR. D&mdash;will do me the favour to
deliver this letter. He is going to
pa&s;s &s;ome time on the continent of Eu|rope,
where he hopes to find that tranquil|lity
which is not, at pre&s;ent, to be obtain|ed
in this unhappy country. I &s;hall leave
him to repre&s;ent, minutely, the calamitous
&s;ituation of the colonies. Government is
now almo&s;t totally annihilated, and power
<PB N="216" REF="264">
transferred to the multitude. Speech is
become dangerous; letters are intercept|ed;
confidence betrayed; and every mea|&s;ure
evidently tends to the mo&s;t fatal ex|tremities:
the &s;word is drawn, and, with|out
&s;ome providential change of mea&s;ures,
the blood of thou&s;ands will be &s;hed in this
unnatural conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Before this letter is received, you will have
heard of the action at <HI>Bunker's Hill.</HI> The
provincials were forced from their intrench|ments;
but it is &s;aid the regulars &s;uffered
&s;o &s;everely, that they cannot afford to ob|tain
future advantages at &s;o dear a price.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this province are in|corporated
under military regulations; and
apply the greater part of their time to the
different branches of di&s;cipline. In An|napolis
there are two complete companies;
in Baltimore &s;even; and in every di&s;trict
of this province the majority of the people
<PB N="217" REF="265">
are actually under arms: almo&s;t every hat
is decorated with a cockade; and the chur|li&s;h
drum and fife are the only mu&s;ic of
the times.</P>
<P>I have not yet, in po&s;itive terms, been
required to mu&s;ter; and, I tru&s;t, my pe|culiar
circum&s;tances will be con&s;idered as
a rea&s;onable plea of exemption. I wi&s;h well
to America.&mdash;It is my duty&mdash;my inclina|tion
&s;o to do&mdash;but I cannot&mdash;I will not&mdash;
con&s;ent to act in direct oppo&s;ition to my oath
of allegiance, and my deliberate opinion.
Rather than &s;ubmit to a conduct &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o
incon&s;i&s;tent with my principles, I will give
up all&mdash;embrace ruin!&mdash;and tru&s;t to the
protecting care of Providence for the future
di&s;po&s;ition of me and mine.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 18th in&s;tant, a num|ber
of armed per&s;ons &s;et fire to a &s;hip which
had accidentally run on ground a few miles
below this city. She was the property of
<PB N="218" REF="266">
Mr. Gildart of Liverpool, and had brought
in &s;ome goods contrary to the a&s;&s;ociation.
This is the &s;econd burnt-offering to liberty
within this province: at the &s;ame time, it
is but ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that the&s;e in&s;tances
of popular fury are heartily condemned by
very many, even of the patriotic party.</P>
<P>Mr, James C&mdash;, a re&s;pectable mer|chant
of Baltimore, lately addre&s;&s;ed a let|ter
to a near relation, Lieutenant-Co|lonel
C&mdash;of the 60th regiment, &s;ta|tioned
in the i&s;land of Antigua, in which
he &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation of
the prevailing &s;y&s;tem. This letter has been
intercepted and laid before the committee
of Baltimore county; and on its being
made public, his hou&s;e was &s;urrounded by
a di&s;orderly rabble, and had not a detach|ment
of the militia interfered, Mr. C&mdash;
would probably have fallen a &s;acrifice. This
gentleman is now a clo&s;e pri&s;oner, under
<PB N="219" REF="267">
the cu&s;tody of a guard, and his ca&s;e is to
be laid before the provincial convention,
who meet to-morrow, in this city, for the
purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing new regulations.</P>
<P>The proclamation i&s;&s;ued by General
Gage is very little regarded. Hancock
and Adams are therein excepted from mer|cy!&mdash;
The Congre&s;s have adjourned until
September.</P>
<P>My friend M&mdash;arrived on the 18th,
and delivered your circum&s;tantial epi&s;tle.
How we are to corre&s;pond hereafter I
know not. On the tenth of September
next the non-exportation a&s;&s;ociation takes
place; and all commercial intercour&s;e will
con&s;equently cea&s;e, until the&s;e unhappy
differences are by &s;ome means decided. It
&s;eems but ye&s;terday that I con&s;idered my
&s;ituation as permanent.&mdash;Every flattering
pro&s;pect appeared before me.&mdash;Happy in
my family, in my connexions, in my cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="220" REF="268">
cheri&s;hed and &s;upported by a
patron, able and anxious to promote my
intere&s;t. Alas! my brethren, how cru|elly
is the &s;cene rever&s;ed! I am &s;uddenly
involved in a train of difficulties and dan|gers,
again&s;t which no human prudence or
fore&s;ight could po&s;&s;ibly guard. How
&s;trangely complicated have been the events
of my life, on which, apparently, my own
conduct has had &s;o little influence. Under
all circum&s;tances believe me ever yours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Aug. 24, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>ON the fourteenth in&s;tant, the Con|vention
concluded their delibe|rations.
If their proceedings are publi&s;hed
before I have an opportunity to tran&s;mit
<PB N="221" REF="269">
this, I will enclo&s;e them for your informa|tion.
You will then be enabled to form
an opinion of the di&s;po&s;ition of this pro|vince.</P>
<P>When you have peru&s;ed the a&s;&s;ociation
of the freemen of Maryland, you will, I
pre&s;ume, acknowledge the propriety of my
objecting to &s;ub&s;cribe to it, and acknow|ledge
that &s;uch conduct would be incon|&s;i&s;tent
with my principles, and the &s;tation
under government, in which I am &s;ituated.
I verily believed &s;ome regard would have
been paid to the particular circum&s;tances
of revenue officers, but our pre&s;ent rulers
entertain different &s;entiments, and all per|&s;ons,
without exception, mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate and
enrol; the Governor, and his hou&s;ehold,
<HI>only</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>His Excellency, ever attentive to my in|tere&s;t,
has generou&s;ly made me an offer to
become one of his family, immediately after
the embarkation of Mrs. E&mdash;, who is
<PB N="222" REF="270">
now anxiou&s;ly preparing for her approach|ing
voyage. We had firmly determined,
that no circum&s;tances, however adver&s;e to
our hopes, &s;hould induce us again to con|&s;ent,
even to a temporary &s;eparation; but
the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of our once more &s;ub|mitting
to it, has of late appeared too
evident. She is perfectly convinced, that
I mu&s;t &s;peedily avow my political &s;enti|ments,
in the mo&s;t explicit manner; and
that my refu&s;al to join in the popular mea|&s;ures,
will &s;ubject me to inconveniences
which may better be &s;upported, when my
family is removed to &s;ome &s;ecure a&s;ylum.
Influenced by &s;uch forcible con&s;iderations,
&s;he has acknowledged the expediency of
what is &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to our dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s!
and early in the en&s;uing month,
we mu&s;t bid farewell!&mdash;a painful farewell
to each other!</P>
<P>The Governor's humane and generous
offer impre&s;&s;es my mind with the mo&s;t
<PB N="223" REF="271" MS="Y">
lively gratitude: yet am I greatly embar|ra&s;&s;ed
how to conduct my&s;elf on the occa|&s;ion.
Con&s;idering the wild, un&s;ettled times,
he is uncommonly popular; but how long
he may continue &s;o is a matter of great
uncertainty. It is highly probable he may
&s;peedily think it nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s his
decided approbation of the pre&s;ent pro|ceedings,
which &s;tep, I am fearful, would
effectually cancel his pa&s;t merits; &s;ubject
him to calumny and cen&s;ure; and render his
longer continuance in Maryland impo&s;&s;ible.
Should the event prove the&s;e conjectures
to be well-founded, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly ex|pect
protection from the friendly attention
of my worthy patron; on the contrary, I
mu&s;t either bid adieu to America, and every
plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, or meanly comply with
the requi&s;itions of the Convention, in direct
oppo&s;ition to the &s;entiments of my heart.
Let me weigh both evils, with a &s;ettled
determination to make that election which
<PB N="224" REF="272">
will hereafter be attended with the mo&s;t
&s;alutary effects, and the mo&s;t plea&s;ing re|flections.</P>
<P>If I abandon this country, in con&s;e|quence
of a &s;teady adherence to my prin|ciples
and my duty, I mu&s;t unavoidably be
&s;ubjected to a precarious life of uncertainty
and dependence; and in&s;tead of enjoying a
comfortable a&s;ylum in my native land, I
may only experience a variety of misfor|tunes
and di&s;appointments, and drink yet
deeper draughts of the cup of affliction. I
am, however, perfectly a&s;&s;ured, if I pre&s;erve
my integrity unblemi&s;hed, though I &s;hould
thereby be &s;ubjected to
<Q><L>&startq;&mdash;the &s;purns</L>
<L>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,&endq;</L></Q>
yet, hereafter, I &s;hall receive an adequate
reward.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;hould I act in oppo|&s;ition
to the dictates of my mind, by &s;ub|&s;cribing
to the a&s;&s;ociation, and taking arms,
<PB N="225" REF="273">
I &s;hall not only be &s;ubject to tho&s;e pain|ful
feelings which accompany a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of doing wrong, but be ju&s;tly de|&s;pi&s;ed
by every brave and hone&s;t man;
dete&s;ted and avoided by every re&s;pectable
&s;ociety; and, when tranquillity is happily
re&s;tored, de&s;ervedly ca&s;t out, to encounter
a complication of mi&s;eries, without one
chearing thought to &s;upport &s;uch a rever&s;e
of fortune.</P>
<P>I have now fairly &s;tated my &s;ituation;
and believe, from your knowledge of
my principles, you will readily determine
how I &s;hall regulate my conduct; and
whenever I am unhappily nece&s;&s;itated to
quit this country, where I have experi|enced
great ble&s;&s;ings, this plea&s;ing reflec|tion
will accompany me, that I have left
behind me a fair and unblemi&s;hed reputa|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="274">
A new emi&s;&s;ion of paper currency, to
the amount of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds &s;terl|ing,

of the Convention, which is hereafter to be
&s;unk by a tax on the inhabitants of this pro|vince;
be&s;ides which, they are to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
their proportion to &s;ink the Congre&s;s mo|ney,
amounting to &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy
five thou&s;and pounds, lately emitted at
Philadelphia, for the payment of the pro|vincial
army. How the&s;e enormous ex|pences
are to be &s;upported, and how the
people are to be maintained, after a total
&s;tagnation of commerce, is not ea&s;y to con|ceive.
If ways and means are not &s;peedily
devi&s;ed to feed the hungry, and cloath the
naked, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly experience all the
horrors of the mo&s;t extreme indigence.</P>
<P>Numbers of my valued friends are now
preparing to bid farewell to a country,
<PB N="227" REF="275">
where they cannot po&s;&s;ibly remain with any
degree of &s;afety, unle&s;s they take an active
part in oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures of go|vernment:
to be neuter is to be adver&s;e.
What a variety of circum&s;tances combine
to make me wretched! It is but too proba|ble
that <HI>I</HI> al&s;o &s;hall &s;oon abandon this con|tinent,
either by &s;entence of bani&s;hment,
or by voluntary retreat. I cannot be ex|celled
by any in good wi&s;hes to Ame|rica,
and I heartily pray that every real evil
under which &s;he labours, may be &s;peedily
and effectually redre&s;&s;ed: but the pre&s;ent
mea&s;ures will never meet my concurrence:
I cannot &s;ub&s;cribe to a compact, which I
believe to be incompatible with my oath of
allegiance; nor can I think it con&s;i&s;tent
with that liberty, which is the univer&s;al cry,
to compel any man to act in direct oppo&s;i|tion
to his well-grounded principles.</P>
<P>I have written you a gloomy letter, which
a word or two more &s;hall conclude. In a
<PB N="228" REF="276">
former epi&s;tle, I mentioned Mr. James
C&mdash;, and the danger to which he was
&s;ubjected in con&s;equence of having im|parted
his opinions too explicitly in con|fidential
corre&s;pondence. That gentleman
has been examined by the Convention, and
there are vindictive &s;pirits who think the
&s;entence he has received, by no means ade|quate
to the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> enormity of his of|fence.
He has been pronounced &startq;an
enemy to America; condemned to perpe|tual
bani&s;hment; and obliged to depo&s;it
the &s;um of five hundred pounds &s;terling,
in the hands of per&s;ons appointed by the
Convention, to be expended occa&s;ionally to|wards
his proportion of all charges incur|red,
or to be incurred, for the defence of
America, during the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with
Great Britain; the overplus, if any, after
a reconciliation &s;hall happily be effected,
to be re&s;tored to the &s;aid James C&mdash;.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="277">
From this you will learn how hazardous
it is become to &s;upport a free intercour&s;e.
The Convention have thus a&s;&s;umed the
powers of all the different branches of go|vernment;
but with what propriety, it be|comes
not me to determine. That the
ble&s;&s;ings of peace may &s;peedily be re&s;tored,
is the fervent prayer of your faithful, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sep. 26th, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM &s;eated, my deare&s;t wife, to tran&s;|mit
a detail of material occurrences,
&s;ince our unhappy &s;eparation on the &s;ix|teenth
in&s;tant.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to delineate the angui&s;h
I experienced when I quitted the ve&s;&s;el
<PB N="230" REF="278">
which was to convey you, and our darling
boy to a land of &s;afety. Anxious to retain
you as long as po&s;&s;ible in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I
had proceeded with you further down the
Bay than prudence warranted, and the
night was far advanced before I regained
the man&s;ion of the ho&s;pitable Colonel. I
then retired to the apartment you had &s;o
recently quitted, and gave a loo&s;e to all the
complicated emotions which &startq;harrowed
up my &s;oul.&endq;</P>
<P>On the nineteenth, the wind being fa|vourable,
I took leave of the worthy family
at Rou&s;ley-hall, and embarked for Anna|polis.
In my way down the river I vi&s;ited
a ve&s;&s;el which had anchored near the mouth
on the preceding evening, and found on
board &s;everal of our valued acquaintance,
who had abandoned their deare&s;t connexions,
rather than a&s;&s;ent to mea&s;ures they could
not con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="279">
Immediately on landing, I repaired to
my new abode at the Governor's, who
received me with that friendly attention
which &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hes his con|duct
on every occa&s;ion. I found him in
company with a few &s;elect loyal friends:
political occurrences engro&s;&s;ed our conver|&s;ation,
in which hope appeared to operate
but weakly, with re&s;pect to the eventful
tran&s;actions of the times. At an early hour
we &s;eparated: my apartment was ready for
my reception; and after invoking Heaven
on behalf of my wife and &s;on, I re&s;ted
with tolerable compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. L&mdash;, who had actually em|barked
for England, with full permi&s;&s;ion
from the ruling powers, has been obliged
to relinqui&s;h his intention, and return on
&s;hore, &s;ome clamours having been excited
by the populace to his prejudice; and it
being thought nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould remain
<PB N="232" REF="280">
to vindicate his conduct. Many of our
friends have found it expedient to take a
French leave. I tru&s;t you will &s;peedily
meet them in perfect &s;afety.</P>
<P>On the twentieth, I vi&s;ited our once
happy man&s;ion. This was an additional
trial of re&s;ignation and fortitude; every
&s;urrounding object too forcibly reminding
me of pa&s;t felicity. Your &s;ervants &s;hewed
the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ibility; and their earne&s;t
and pathetic inquiries relative to their dear
mi&s;tre&s;s and our beloved boy, proved the
fervency and &s;incerity of their attachment.
In a few days they remove to their re&s;pec|tive
&s;ituations. What a dreadful rever&s;e
have I already experienced!</P>
<P><DATE>Septem. 26th, <HI>P. M.</HI></DATE></P>
<P>About an hour &s;ince, the governor was
exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed by the receipt of a
letter from Mr. L&mdash;. D&mdash;, dated from
Philadelphia. The contents intimate, that
<PB N="233" REF="281">
on the tenth and eleventh in&s;tant they en|countered
a mo&s;t violent &s;torm, about &s;ixty
leagues to the ea&s;tward of Virginia, during
which the Annapolis lo&s;t all her ma&s;ts;
and that they continued three days in that
dangerous &s;ituation, before they were able
to fix-jury ma&s;ts, under which they made
&s;ail for the coa&s;t of America. On Tue&s;|day,
the nineteenth, they had the good
fortune to fall in with a ve&s;&s;el bound to
Philadelphia, which received the pa&s;&s;en|gers,
and conveyed them to that city. Cap|tain
H&mdash;intends to go into the fir&s;t
port he can make, in order to repair his
damages, which are con&s;iderable. I need
not ob&s;erve, that we wait for intelligence
of his arrival with great anxiety.</P>
<P>We once con&s;idered the circum&s;tances
which prevented your &s;ailing in that &s;hip,
as a very &s;evere di&s;appointment; but in
con&s;equence of that &s;eeming evil, what

inconveniences, what terrors, have you not
happily avoided! what increa&s;ed expence!
which in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation we are little
able to &s;upport.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day evening, <DATE>Sep. 27.</DATE></P>
<P>This morning early we were alarmed by
the beating of drums, and a proclamation
for the inhabitants to a&s;&s;emble at the Li|berty
Tree. The purport of this meeting
was to obtain a re&s;olve, &startq;That all per&s;ons
who had refu&s;ed to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation,
and comply with the other requi&s;itions,
&s;hould be obliged to quit the city, as ene|mies
to the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of America.&endq;
I have, however, the plea&s;ure to inform
you, that this violent project was defeated
with little difficulty: every judicious and
rea&s;onable per&s;on &s;eeing through the per|nicious
tendency of &s;uch a de&s;ign; and
the promoters, who were among&s;t the
lowe&s;t of the people, not being &s;upported
<PB N="235" REF="283">
or encouraged. It is needle&s;s to mention,
that this proceeding was directly oppo&s;ite to
the re&s;olves of the Convention; it having
been determined by that body, that <HI>they only</HI>
were competent to take cognizance of of|fences,
and to a&s;certain the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I am, however, clearly of opinion, that
all power will quickly be transferred into
the hands of the multitude, who once tak|ing
the lead, will not ea&s;ily be reduced again
to proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In &s;ome counties
they have had warm conte&s;ts in electing
their delegates for the en&s;uing convention,
and in appointing members of the re&s;pec|tive
committees. In Talbot, the poll la&s;ted
&s;everal days; party prejudices were highly
predominant, and much ill blood produced.</P>
<P>Mr. R&mdash;, the Attorney General of
Virginia, with his lady and daughters, are
on their pa&s;&s;age to England. His &s;on is of
the adver&s;e party, and is appointed an aid-du-camp
<PB N="236" REF="284">
to General Wa&s;hington; with
whom, beneath the ho&s;pitable roof of our
worthy governor, I have &s;o frequently &s;hared
the hour of &s;ocial and &s;entimental di&s;cour&s;e.
Little did I then conceive, that he was de&s;|tined
to be called forth, by the united voice
of America, from the private occupations
of dome&s;tic tranquillity, to direct ho&s;tile
operations again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the Bri|ti&s;h
government. Re&s;erved in conver&s;a|tion,
but liberal in opinion, his actions
have, hitherto, been directed by calmne&s;s
and moderation; a per&s;everance in which
conduct may re&s;train mi&s;guided ardor, and
direct every movement to that grand point;
a permanent and con&s;titutional reconcilia|tion.</P>
<P>The exaltation of this gentleman to the
&s;upreme command, is con&s;idered as a &s;e|vere
&s;troke to the ambition of General
Lee; who, relying on a &s;uppo&s;ed opinion
<PB N="237" REF="285">
of his &s;uperior abilities and experience,
expected to have been unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en
to this elevated &s;tation. I am per&s;uad|ed,
that General Wa&s;hington would re|joice
in an opportunity of returning into
the private walks of life: but it is too
evident that General Lee is governed by a
vindictive &s;pirit, the re&s;ult of di&s;appoint|ment
in military advancement, while in the
&s;ervice of Great Britain. Perhaps this ad|ditional
mortification may moderate his
zeal in the cau&s;e he has recently e&s;pou&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Council of Safety have given di|rections
to &s;everal gentlemen in public de|partments,
to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s
to remove their books and papers. Inti|mations
of this nature have not yet ex|tended
to my&s;elf or colleague, but when
the Convention meet, it is expected we
&s;hall be included in whatever regulations
they may think nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>

<P>Annapolis is daily more and more de|&s;erted;

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 16, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>AFFAIRS in Virginia have borne,
for &s;ome time, a very &s;erious a&s;|pect.
On the 25th of October la&s;t, Lord
Dunmore cannonaded Hampton, a com|mercial
town on the banks of the Che&s;a|peak,
but was repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of
&s;ome men and a tender, which was taken
by the militia. In con&s;equence of this
tran&s;action, on the 7th of November, a pro|clamation
was i&s;&s;ued by his lord&s;hip, dated
on board the &s;hip William, lying off Nor|fok,
declaring, &startq;that as the civil law was
in&s;ufficient, at that period, to prevent and
<PB N="251" REF="299">
puni&s;h trea&s;on, martial law &s;hould take
place, and be executed throughout the
colony; therefore requiring all per&s;ons
capable of bearing arms, to repair to his
maje&s;ty's &s;tandard, or to be con&s;idered
as traytors. He al&s;o declared all in|dented
&s;ervants, negroes, or others ap|pertaining
to per&s;ons in oppo&s;ition to
government, who were able and willing
to bear arms, and who joined his ma|je&s;ty's
forces, to be free.&endq;</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure of emancipating the ne|groes
has excited an univer&s;al ferment, and
will, I apprehend, greatly &s;trengthen the
general confederacy.</P>
<P>The proclamation, however, had &s;ome
immediate effect in the opulent town of
Norfolk, where many of the inhabitants
were well affected to government. The
governor was &s;peedily joined by &s;ome hun|dreds
of all complexions, and he doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="252" REF="300">
formed an idea, that the di&s;po&s;ition
to loyalty, which he di&s;covered in that
neighbourhood, would have been &s;uffici|ently
general for enabling him to rai&s;e a
force competent to re-e&s;tabli&s;h, what he
deemed a proper degree of &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>This delu&s;ive expectation was interrupt|ed
by information, that a party of provin|cials,
under the command of Colonel
Woodford, were on their march to oppo&s;e
his mea&s;ures. To ob&s;truct their progre&s;s,
and to &s;upport tho&s;e who were well-affected,
Lord Dunmore immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a po&s;t called the Great Bridge, &s;ome miles
di&s;tant from Norfolk, which is a pa&s;s of
great con&s;equence, and the only practicable
way of approaching that town. Both par|ties
fortified them&s;elves within cannon &s;hot
of each other; and as a narrow cau&s;eway
lay between them, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
be pa&s;&s;ed previous to an attack, they ap|peared
<PB N="253" REF="301">
to be mutually &s;ecured from any
danger of &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, they continued in|active
&s;everal days, till, at length, a de|&s;ign
was formed of &s;urpri&s;ing the Ameri|can
troops in their intrenchments. Cap|tain
Fordyce, a very gallant officer, at the
head of about &s;ixty grenadiers, led the at|tack:
they pa&s;&s;ed the cau&s;eway with the
utmo&s;t intrepidity, and with fixed bayo|nets
ru&s;hed on an enemy, who were pro|perly
prepared for their reception; for
Captain Fordyce's party were not only ex|po&s;ed,
naked, to a heavy fire in front,
but were enfiladed from another part of
the works. The brave leader, with &s;eve|ral
of his men, fell; the lieutenant, with
the re&s;idue, all of whom were &s;everely
wounded, were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The fire of the artillery from the Briti&s;h
fort, enabled the forces under the com|mand
<PB N="254" REF="302">
of the governor, to retreat from
the po&s;t which they had occupied, and
which was now no longer tenable, with|out
pur&s;uit; and as all hopes in this quar|ter
were terminated by the defeat, Lord
Dunmore thought it expedient to abandon
the town and neighbourhood of Norfolk,
and retire on board the &s;hipping, with
numbers of per&s;ons, who having been ac|tive
in &s;upporting his mea&s;ures, found it
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek the &s;ame a&s;ylum. A con|&s;iderable
number of ve&s;&s;els was, by this
means, collected, crowded with people and
effects; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing little force and in
great want of able mariners. The pro|vincials
immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Norfolk, and the governor, with his ad|herents,
removed to a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The loyali&s;ts who had taken refuge in
the fleet, together with the &s;eamen and
military, quickly became &s;en&s;ible of many
<PB N="255" REF="303">
difficulties and hard&s;hips; provi&s;ions, ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
and every kind of &s;uccour, being
ab&s;olutely denied from the adjacent &s;hore.
The &s;hips, likewi&s;e, being con&s;tantly an|noyed
by the fire of the Americans, from
that part of the town which lay neare&s;t
the water, it was determined to di&s;lodge
them, by de&s;troying it. A flag, however,
was fir&s;t &s;ent on &s;hore, to learn &startq;whether
the provincials would regularly &s;upply
his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips with water and pro|vi&s;ions,&endq;
which requi&s;ition being an|&s;wered
in the negative, extremities were
re&s;olved on. Previous notice being ac|cordingly
given, that the inhabitants might
remove to &s;ituations of &s;ecurity, the fir&s;t
day of the pre&s;ent year was &s;ignalized by
the attack; when a violent cannonading
commenced from the Liverpool frigate,
two &s;loops of war, and the Governor's
armed &s;hip, the Dunmore; &s;upported by
parties of the &s;ailors and marines, who
<PB N="256" REF="304">
landed, and &s;et fire to the neare&s;t hou&s;es.
The&s;e mea&s;ures &s;oon produced the intended
effect; but not without the de&s;truction of
the whole town, which by the rapid pro|gre&s;s
of the flames, was quickly reduced
to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the copy of a gazette, which
was printed on board the Governor's &s;hip,
he having removed the pre&s;s and materials
thither from Norfolk, in which it is con|fidently,
and with great probability a&s;&s;erted,
&startq;that it was only intended to de&s;troy that
part of the town which adjoined the
river, but that the provincials com|pleted
the deva&s;tation, by &s;etting fire
to the remote &s;treets; which, as the
wind then &s;tood, would otherwi&s;e have
been &s;ecure from danger.&endq;</P>
<P>Such has been the fate of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
commercial town in the colony
of Virginia; and the whole lo&s;s upon the
occa&s;ion, is e&s;timated at above three hun|dred
<PB N="257" REF="305">
thou&s;and pounds. This unhappy
event has given a fre&s;h alarm to our citi|zens,
many of whom are preparing to quit
Annapolis.</P>
<P>The Provincial A&s;&s;embly have been &s;it|ting
here, ever &s;ince the fourth of Decem|ber.
It is expected they will &s;peedily ad|journ.</P>
<P>Our Governor is in perfect health. He
&s;till continues to receive every external
mark of attention and re&s;pect; while the
&s;teady propriety of his conduct, in many
trying exigencies, reflects the utmo&s;t cre|dit
on his moderation and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>My ignorance of your &s;ituation, is a very

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>March 14th, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>THE inhabitants of this city have
been exceedingly alarmed. On the
fifth in&s;tant, about eight in the evening,
intelligence was received, that a &s;hip of
war was on her pa&s;&s;age up the bay; and at
no great di&s;tance from Annapolis. The
con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned by this informa|tion,
exceeds de&s;cription. The night was
tempe&s;tuous; extremely dark; and the
rain de&s;cended in torrents: notwith&s;tanding
which, many per&s;ons began to remove their
effects; and the &s;treets were quickly crowded
<PB N="259" REF="307">
with carriages laden with furniture, and
property of various kinds. A little reflec|tion
mu&s;t have made it evident, that with|out
violent provocation, ho&s;tilities would
not have commenced: and at all events,
that timely notice would have been given,
previous to any bombardment. It ought
to have been con&s;idered, that a governor,
acting under the authority of Great Britain,
was re&s;ident in the town, and, apparently,
exerci&s;ing the powers with which he was
inve&s;ted. No complaint had been tran&s;|mitted,
on his part, relative to the treat|ment
experienced by him, and the adhe|rents
of admini&s;tration. His prudent and
con&s;i&s;tent conduct, had greatly tended to
prevent per&s;onal outrages; and under &s;uch
circum&s;tances, it was manife&s;t, that no
commander in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, could
have formed the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of pro|ceeding
to extremities, without commu|nicating
<PB N="260" REF="308">
his intentions to the &s;upreme
magi&s;trate, who was undoubtedly a valua|ble
pledge in the hands of the people, to
&s;ecure them&s;elves and property from imme|diate
violence.</P>
<P>But as rea&s;on &s;eldom operates under
in&s;tantaneous impre&s;&s;ions, the Governor
re&s;olved to pur&s;ue every eligible method
that might effectually remove the appre|hen&s;ions
&s;o univer&s;ally entertained. Actu|ated
by &s;uch motives, he made immediate
application to the Council of Safety, and,
in order to di&s;&s;ipate the general anxiety,
propo&s;ed &s;ending a flag of truce on board
his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip, the in&s;tant &s;he made
her appearance, or came to an anchor off
the harbour. An offer &s;o evidently tending
to pre&s;erve the public tranquillity, was ac|cepted
with every &s;uitable acknowledg|ment;
and on the &s;eventh in&s;tant, a &s;hip
of war, accompanied by a tender, pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="261" REF="309">
by Annapolis, I had the honour to be de|puted
to perform this &s;ervice; on which
occa&s;ion I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to
obviate any mi&s;repre&s;entation, to tran&s;cribe,
as follows, the &s;ub&s;tance of my negotiation,
for the in&s;pection of the Governor, the
Council of Safety, and the Committee of
Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Friday, <DATE>March 8th.</DATE></P>
<P>&startq;By order of his Excellency the Gover|nor,&endq;
and with the approbation of the pre|&s;ident
of the Council of Safety, I repaired
ye&s;terday on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop, the
Otter, commanded by Captain Squire, then
lying at an anchor in Che&s;apeak Bay, be|tween
Magotty River, and the Bodkin;
and delivered to him a letter from the Go|vernor,
to which a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer was
returned, and immediately made known,
for the general information of the citizens
of Annapolis.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="310">
&startq;In conver&s;ation with Captain Squire,&endq;
I took occa&s;ion to expatiate on the temper
and moderation of the people of Mary|land;
their attachment to the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution;
and their &s;ettled aver&s;ion to any
de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing an independency: for
an a&s;&s;urance of which, I referred him to
the in&s;tructions given to their delegates in
Congre&s;s, and to the proceedings of the
late Convention.</P>
<P>&startq;I informed Captain Squire,&endq; that from
the commencement of the&s;e unhappy di&s;|&s;entions,
the Governor and his friends had
been treated with re&s;pect and attention;
I recommended the utmo&s;t moderation in
the execution of his orders; and a&s;&s;ured
him, that in &s;o doing, the e&s;teem of the
people would be &s;o far conciliated, as to
render the Maryland &s;tation as convenient
and agreeable as the nature of the times
would admit.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="311">
&startq;Captain Squire,&endq; on his part, expli|citly
acquainted me, that it was the fur|the&s;t
from his intentions to proceed to any
extremities; that he was in&s;tructed to de|mand
a privateer, avowedly fitted out at
Baltimore, for ho&s;tile purpo&s;es; as al&s;o
&s;ome ve&s;&s;els laden with flour, of which the
navy were in the greate&s;t want; that he
was ready to pay the market price for any
provi&s;ions that the inhabitants would &s;up|ply
him with; but otherwi&s;e he was under
an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to &s;eize whatever
might come within his power. Captain
Squire promi&s;ed, that if his requi&s;itions
were complied with, not the lea&s;t damage
&s;hould en&s;ue to any individual, or to the
town of Baltimore.</P>
<P>&startq;Captain Squire mentioned,&endq; that he had
given particular directions to the gentle|men
under his command, not to fire, under
any pretext, upon &s;uch per&s;ons as might
<PB N="264" REF="312">
a&s;&s;emble on the adjacent &s;hores, or permit
any depredations; but to perform &s;uch
duty only, as was ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to his
Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>&startq;Captain Squire,&endq; from the whole of his
behaviour, di&s;covered the utmo&s;t concern
for the unhappy breach which had taken
place between the mother country, and her
colonies; and obliged as he was, to act in
the line of his duty, it appeared his mo&s;t
earne&s;t wi&s;h to avoid any mea&s;ures which
might only tend to widen the calamitous
di&s;&s;ention.</P>
<P>&startq;To the above I have only to add,
that my bu&s;ine&s;s on board was to recom|mend
temperate proceedings, and to ob|tain
&s;uch intelligence as might conduce to
remove the apprehen&s;ions of the much
alarmed citizens of Annapolis, in which
&s;ervice I have the &s;atisfaction to believe I
have not been altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="265" REF="313">
Early in the afternoon, the armed ve&s;|&s;el,
of which they were in que&s;t, appeared
in &s;ight. The tender, belonging to the
&s;loop of war, had proceeded further up the
bay, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;hip,
with a valuable cargo, then lying at an
anchor, and ready for &s;ea: but on the ap|proach
of a force greatly &s;uperior, the cap|tors
were reluctantly obliged to relinqui&s;h
their prize, and ha&s;ten to the Otter, with
intimation of their di&s;appointment. Every
circum&s;tance plainly indicated an intention,
on the part of the privateer, to attack his
Maje&s;ty's &s;loop; which immediately got
under way, in order to prepare for their
reception. While they were weighing,
I took leave of the captain and officers,
and repaired on board the &s;chooner which
brought me from Annapolis, in firm ex|pectation
that the action would commence
before I could po&s;&s;ibly proceed far on my
return. Shortly after I quitted the Otter,
<PB N="266" REF="314">
&s;he &s;truck on a &s;hoal, and heeled confidera|bly,
in which &s;ituation &s;he could have
made very little re&s;i&s;tance, had the provin|cial
commander thought it advi&s;able to
have then availed him&s;elf of that op|portunity.
She, however, quickly righted,
and &s;tood for her opponent, who, po&s;&s;ibly
in pur&s;uance of orders, put about, and di|rected
her cour&s;e for Baltimore. Night
approaching, and the navigation being in|tricate,
the Otter came again to an anchor
near the mouth of the Patap&s;co.</P>
<P>On the ninth, the Otter returned down
the bay, and anchored off the mouth of our
harbour; &s;oon after which a flag of truce
was di&s;patched on &s;hore. The officer who
brought it was received with re&s;pect; two
gentlemen of the Council of Safety were
pre&s;ent at the delivery of his me&s;&s;age; and
the day was concluded at the Governor's,
in a &s;ociable manner. During this inter|val,
<PB N="267" REF="315">
the &s;eamen who accompanied the offi|cer
continued in their boat, at a &s;mall di&s;|tance
from the &s;hore, where they &s;upported
a friendly conver&s;ation with the provincial
military, who were &s;tationed on the beach
to pre&s;erve regularity.</P>
<P>Early on the en&s;uing day, another flag
attended the Governor, but continued with
him a very &s;hort time: and about noon,
the Otter made &s;ail to join the fleet on the
Virginia &s;tation.</P>
<P>It was certainly a mo&s;t happy circum|&s;tance,
that this vi&s;it was not attended with
more &s;erious con&s;equences. Had an action
taken place, which at one time appeared
too probable, whatever might have been
the event, factious and ambitious men
would eagerly have embraced the oppor|tunity
to have fomented the general di&s;|content.
The Defence, which is the name
of the armed &s;hip fitted out at Baltimore,
is much &s;uperior in force to the Otter
<PB N="268" REF="316">
&s;loop, and was crouded with &s;eamen and
volunteers, who appeared re&s;olute and de|termined.
Many are of opinion they acted
wi&s;ely in declining the conte&s;t. They had
retaken the prize, the avowed object of
their intentions; and admitting their claim
equal with re&s;pect to courage, added to the
circum&s;tances of a &s;uperior force, the&s;e
advantages would, probably, by no means
have counterbalanced the acknowledged
activity and addre&s;s, which &s;o remarkably
di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;eamen of the Briti&s;h
navy.</P>
<P><DATE>March 25th.</DATE></P>
<P>I am this day rendered happy by intel|ligence
of your &s;afe arrival, and mo&s;t plea&s;|ing
reception. Under what a painful, te|dious
uncertainty have I laboured! But
my mind is now relieved&mdash;you are &s;ur|rounded
by faithful friends, who will zeal|ou&s;ly
exert every effort to promote your
<PB N="269" REF="317">

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>March 29th, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>AN authentic account arrived this
day, that the Briti&s;h forces have
evacuated Bo&s;ton, and that General Wa&s;h|ington,
with the continental troops, had
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This important event took
place on the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant. The rea|&s;ons
which rendered this mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary,
will probably reach England at an earlier
period than it will reach this part of America.
Various opinions are indu&s;triou&s;ly circulat|ed;
and &s;ome, who pretend to have inve&s;|tigated
<PB N="270" REF="318">
the real motives of this &s;udden and
unexpected event, con&s;ider the conduct of
Sir William Howe, as a preliminary to|wards
a reconciliation.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t credit is given to the Briti&s;h
general, for the propriety and regularity
with which he conducted the evacuation;
and though his de&s;ign for &s;ome days had
been manife&s;tly evident, the provincial army
continued quiet in their works, without
any efforts to ob&s;truct the embarkation, or
to mole&s;t the rear. Several hundreds of
the inhabitants, who&s;e attachment to Go|vernment
had rendered them obnoxious,
have removed, with their families and ef|fects,
on board the tran&s;ports and &s;hips of
war; and numerous conjectures are formed,
with re&s;pect to their de&s;tination. The &s;ea|&s;on
of the year operates &s;trongly again&s;t a
di&s;tant voyage. Beacons are, therefore,
e&s;tabli&s;hed along the coa&s;t, to give the mo&s;t
<PB N="271" REF="319">
immediate notice of their approach, &s;hould
a de&s;ign be formed again&s;t any other part
of the continent, which the commanders
of his Maje&s;ty's forces may deem more
acce&s;&s;ible. A &s;hort time mu&s;t re&s;olve
every doubt.</P>
<P>From pre&s;ent appearances, there are but
faint hopes of a &s;peedy reconciliation.
Greater requi&s;itions will a&s;&s;uredly be made,
than I fear, can con&s;i&s;tently be complied
with. In political, as in moral events,
one evil imperceptibly leads to another.
The original limited boundary is ca&s;t far
behind; and new claims, and new pur&s;uits,
are even &s;anctified by the fallacious plea
of ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity. In Maryland, a
&s;pirit of moderation is yet predominant;
and if an opinion may be formed from ge|neral
appearances, every endeavour is di|rected
to re&s;tore a con&s;titutional connexion
with the parent &s;tate. But in &s;everal po|pulous
<PB N="272" REF="320">
and powerful provinces, doctrines
are indu&s;triou&s;ly promulgated, and eagerly
received, which will effectually bar every
avenue to a pacific accommodation; and
the mo&s;t &s;anguine adherents to the intere&s;ts
of Great Britain, cannot, with propriety,
indulge the fainte&s;t idea, that any &s;ingle
colony, however influenced by circum|&s;tance
or inclination, can po&s;&s;ibly pretend
to &s;tem the torrent, &s;hould it unhappily
tend to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an independent
government.</P>
<P>From &s;uch con&s;iderations, I am naturally
led to believe, that the day cannot be far
di&s;tant, when it will be nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e
to abandon this country, who cannot con|&s;i&s;tently
coincide with the popular mea|&s;ures.
Be, therefore, always prepared to
&s;ee me: and let not my &s;udden appearance
affect your mind too &s;en&s;ibly. On the
other hand, yield not to gloomy apprehen|&s;ions,
<PB N="273" REF="321">
if a con&s;iderable time &s;hould elap&s;e,
without your receiving any intimation of
my welfare; and be not alarmed, when
reports are circulated relative to calamities
incident to war. Adieu!</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>May 20, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>THE Congre&s;s, by a declaration of
the fifteenth in&s;tant, have earne&s;tly
recommended to &startq;the re&s;pective a&s;&s;em|blies
and conventions of the united co|lonies,
where no government &s;ufficient
to the exigencies of their affairs has
been hitherto e&s;tabli&s;hed, to adopt &s;uch
government as &s;hall in the opinion of
the repre&s;entatives of the people be&s;t
<PB N="274" REF="322">
conduce to the happine&s;s and &s;afety of
their con&s;tituents, and America in ge|neral.&endq;
This declaration is grounded
on the prohibitory act, by which, &startq;the in|habitants
of Briti&s;h America are totally
excluded from the protection of the
crown.&endq; &startq;It is al&s;o alledged therein,
that no an&s;wer has been, or is like to be
returned to the humble petitions of the
colonies; but that in&s;tead of attending
to the redre&s;s of grievances, coercive
mea&s;ures are adopted; by which the
whole force of the mother country, aid|ed
by foreign mercenaries, is to be ex|erted
for their de&s;truction. From &s;uch
con&s;iderations, it is a&s;&s;erted to be ab&s;o|lutely
irreconcileable to rea&s;on, and good
con&s;cience, to take the oaths and affir|mations
nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of any
government under the dominion of
Great Britain, and therefore expedient
that the exerci&s;e of every kind of au|thority
<PB N="275" REF="323">
under the &s;aid crown, &s;hould be
totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and all the powers of
government hereafter exerted under the
authority of the people of the colonies;
for the pre&s;ervation of internal peace,
virtue, and good order; as well as for
the defence of their lives, liberties, and
properties, again&s;t the ho&s;tile inva&s;ions,
and cruel depredations of their enemies.&endq;
Whether any of the provinces, by their
delegates in congre&s;s, have di&s;&s;ented from
a mea&s;ure which mu&s;t, inevitably, be pro|ductive
of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences,
has not yet been a&s;certained; but it is cer|tain,
that the colony of Virginia has taken
a mo&s;t decided lead in promoting a total
&s;eparation from Great Britain. For on
the &s;ame day in which congre&s;s came to
the re&s;olution above-mentioned, the con|vention
in William&s;burgh i&s;&s;ued a &s;imilar
declaration, but expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch &s;trong
and pointed terms, as evidently indicate a
<PB N="276" REF="324">
&s;ettled determination never to acknowledge
them&s;elves in any degree &s;ubordinate to the
influence or authority of the Briti&s;h go|vernment.</P>
<P>There were pre&s;ent that day in conven|tion,
one hundred and twelve members,
who, after &s;tating the rea&s;ons which in|fluenced
their conduct, conclude with the
following <HI>unanimous</HI> re&s;olution.</P>
<P>&startq;That the delegates appointed to re|pre&s;ent
this colony in general congre&s;s,
be in&s;tructed to propo&s;e to that re&s;pec|table
body, <HI>to declare the United Colonies
free and independent States,</HI> ab&s;olved from
all allegiance to, or dependence upon
the crown, or parliament of Great Bri|tain;
and that they give the a&s;&s;ent of
this colony to &s;uch declaration, and to
whatever mea&s;ures may be thought pro|per
and nece&s;&s;ary by the congre&s;s for
forming foreign alliances, and a confe|deration
<PB N="277" REF="325">
of the colonies, at &s;uch time,
and in the &s;ame manner, as to them &s;hall
&s;eem be&s;t: PROVIDED, that the power
of forming government for, and the re|gulations
of the internal concerns of
&s;uch colonies, be left to the re&s;pective
colonial legi&s;latures.&endq;</P>
<P>To very many this proceeding appears
extraordinary and premature; commi&s;&s;i|oners
being daily expected to receive the
claims of the colonies; in order to adju&s;t
and regulate the terms of reconciliation.
It is po&s;&s;ible their powers may be ample;
&s;urely their extent ought at lea&s;t to be a&s;|certained,

entering upon a negociation. In &s;peaking
thus far, I but declare the &s;entiments of
many re&s;pectable individuals who have,

<P>Some events have recently taken place,

con&s;equences to me and mine. But
that you may be enabled to form a proper
idea of my pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation, I mu&s;t
relate &s;ome material circum&s;tances, which
took place early in the preceding month.</P>
<P>A gentleman, who had &s;ome private
concerns with the Earl of Dunmore, ob|tained
permi&s;&s;ion from the council of &s;afety
<PB N="279" REF="327">
Maryland, to attend his lord&s;hip on board
his &s;hip, then lying off the town of Nor|folk
in Virginia; and on his return he
took charge of &s;uch letters as were arrived
in the fleet, addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons in this
province, among&s;t them was a packet for
our governor from Lord George Germaine,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate for the American depart|ment.</P>
<P>In his pa&s;&s;age up the bay, he was board|ed
by an armed ve&s;&s;el in the provincial &s;er|vice,
the commander of which examined
his papers, and after taking from him the
official di&s;patches, permitted him to pro|ceed
to Annapolis, with &s;uch letters as
were totally unconnected with political
tran&s;actions. On the 6th of April he ar|rived
in this city, by which opportunity I
had the happine&s;s to receive your epi&s;tle
of the &s;ixteenth of November la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="328">
Lord George Germaine's letter acknow|ledged
the important information which ad|mini&s;tration
had received from our governor,
who was a&s;&s;ured &startq;of his Maje&s;ty's entire
approbation of his conduct; and was di|rected
to proceed in the line of his duty
with all po&s;&s;ible addre&s;s and activity.&endq;</P>
<P>This packet was forwarded to General
Lee, who has the command of the &s;outh|ern
di&s;trict, by whom it was immediately
di&s;patched to Maryland, with a &s;trong re|commendation
to &s;eize the per&s;on of the
governor, together with all papers and do|cuments
of office; by which it was pre|&s;umed
&s;ome important di&s;coveries would
be made of mini&s;terial intentions.</P>
<P>The council of &s;afety acted on this cri|tical
occa&s;ion with the utmo&s;t moderation
and delicacy. Governor Eden, by the af|fability
of his manners, and his evident
di&s;po&s;ition to promote the intere&s;ts of the
<PB N="281" REF="329">
province, had conciliated univer&s;al regard.
They, therefore, avoided proceeding with
that precipitate vigour &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly en|joined;
and only required him to give his
parole, that he would not take any mea|&s;ures
for leaving the continent, till after
the meeting of the next convention.</P>
<P>This requi&s;ition the governor, for &s;ome
time, warmly re&s;i&s;ted; but, on convic|tion
that the mea&s;ure was unavoidable, he
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to comply, therefore,
on the &s;ixteenth of the month, gave every
&s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh in&s;tant the convention
a&s;&s;embled, and ye&s;terday they came to a
determination re&s;pecting my worthy pa|tron;
when it was re&s;olved, &startq;that his
longer continuance in the province, at
&s;o critical a period, might be preju|dicial
to the cau&s;e in which the colonies
were unanimou&s;ly engaged; and that,

therefore, his immediate departure for
England was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.&endq; An
addre&s;s was accordingly directed to be
drawn up, and pre&s;ented to his excellency,
which was delivered to him this evening
by a committee of that body.</P>
<P>In this addre&s;s the &s;entiments of the
convention are expre&s;&s;ed in liberal terms;
&startq;they acknowledge the &s;ervices rendered
by the governor to the country, on many
former occa&s;ions; and they expre&s;s the
warme&s;t wi&s;hes, that when the unhap|py
di&s;putes which, at pre&s;ent prevail,
are con&s;titutionally accommodated, he
may &s;peedily return and re-a&s;&s;ume the
reins of government.&endq;</P>
<P>I cannot yet form any conclu&s;ion how
I am to regulate my conduct on this im|portant
occa&s;ion. The governor is of opi|nion
that it is my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to re|main
in Maryland, while the ancient form
<PB N="283" REF="331">
of government is, in any degree, acknow|ledged
and continued. But how long that
will be, is a matter of great uncertainty.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that the
mo&s;t re&s;pectable leading men in this pro|vince,
have acted with as much temper
and propriety, as the nature of the times
would admit. Yet I am apprehen&s;ive,
however favourably they may be now di&s;|po&s;ed,
they will not long be able to &s;tem
the torrent which, in &s;everal provinces,
runs &s;trongly towards independence. What|ever
may be the complexion of my fate, I
will continue to act con&s;i&s;tently with, what
I conceive, to be my duty; and &s;hould
nece&s;&s;ity compel me to revi&s;it my native
clime, I &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be &s;upported by a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that my misfortunes are de|rived
from inevitable events, and not from
impropriety of conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="332">
Our friends mu&s;t not expect from my
pen, any comments on the pre&s;ent opera|tions:
I am determined to avoid di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions
which cannot po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer any &s;a|lutary
purpo&s;e; nor will I cen&s;ure any in|dividual,
or collective body, merely from
being actuated by &s;entiments different from
my own. Human nature, even in the full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every human acquirement,
cannot po&s;&s;ibly be exempt from error: and
the be&s;t intended actions are, &s;ometimes,
liable to cen&s;ure. I therefore tru&s;t it will
be ever my di&s;po&s;ition to judge in the mo&s;t
favourable manner of my fellow-creatures,
and acknowledge every man to be right,
who&s;e conduct is directed by the con&s;cien|tious
dictates of his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Saturday, <DATE>June 1.</DATE></P>
<P>Our friend S&mdash;embarked la&s;t Sunday
for Virginia, to learn whether there were
<PB N="285" REF="333">
any ve&s;&s;els, on that &s;tation, bound for Eng|land;
and ye&s;terday he returned from his
expedition. A &s;hip of war, under a flag
of truce, will &s;hortly be ordered hither to
convey the governor down the bay; who
is now fully engaged in making prepara|tions
for his departure. I am, however,
of opinion, he will not immediately pro|ceed
for Europe; but that he will be anx|ious
to remain near the &s;cene of action,
until a competent judgment can be form|ed,
whether any reconciliation is likely to
be effected; an event which a few weeks
will probably determine.</P>
<P>Mr. S&mdash;, my&s;elf, and my colleague,
are to continue for the pre&s;ent in our re|&s;pective
&s;tations. The fir&s;t named is charg|ed
with the &s;ettlement of the governor's
private concerns; and as the loan office is
of the utmo&s;t provincial importance, it is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the commi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="286" REF="334">
&s;hould continue to act in that department,
as long as a &s;hadow remains of the ancient
con&s;titution. Should tho&s;e who have now
the a&s;cendency, think it expedient to model
a new &s;y&s;tem, under which I cannot con|&s;cientiou&s;ly
remain, I &s;hall avail my&s;elf of
the fir&s;t opportunity to take leave of this
continent.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of re&s;iding with the
governor, I expected an exemption from
any penalties inflicted on per&s;ons, who
had refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;ociate or enrol. But in
this idea I was very materially mi&s;taken.
The committee of ob&s;ervation will not
con&s;ider me as a member of his excellency's
hou&s;ehold; alledging in &s;upport of their
opinion, that I hold offices immediately
dependent on the province. The&s;e are
not times to di&s;pute nice points. I have
therefore paid ten pounds for my fine, and
have taken a receipt for the &s;ame. My
<PB N="287" REF="335">
arms have likewi&s;e been demanded. I am,
however, happy to inform you, that I
have con&s;tantly been treated with kind
attention, even by political opponents. It
is my endeavour to regulate my conduct
with propriety; carefully avoiding mixed
company; taking heed that &startq;I offend not
with my tongue;&endq; and not permitting my
pen to expatiate on the tendency of public
tran&s;actions. I intru&s;t this to the care of
a friend, bound to Li&s;bon; may it &s;afely
reach you!</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>June 4th, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>EVERY day is pregnant with &s;ome
new event. I am apprehen&s;ive from
a recent circum&s;tance, that I mu&s;t quickly
<PB N="288" REF="336">
bid adieu to Maryland. The committee
of ob&s;ervation have, this morning, &s;erved
me with a &s;ummons to attend them on
Thur&s;day next, &startq;to give &s;ecurity for my
behaviour during the pre&s;ent unhappy
contention with Great Britain.&endq; I
mu&s;t either comply; &s;ubmit to impri&s;on|ment;
or abandon the country. The fir&s;t
I con&s;ider as incompatible with my oath of
allegiance: confinement is an evil I would
mo&s;t willingly avoid; and a voyage to Eu|rope
will, inevitatably, &s;ubject me to all
the complicated embarra&s;&s;ments attending
di&s;appointment, and a contracted income:
but at all events, I will rely on Providence,
and per&s;evere in my integrity.</P>
<P>When I appear before the Committee, I
propo&s;e to intimate my intention of return|ing
home; and &s;hall only entreat a rea|&s;onable
time to adju&s;t my public and pri|vate
concerns; that I may be enabled to
<PB N="289" REF="337">
leave the province with un&s;ullied reputa|tion.
I hope the Governor will not &s;ail
before my fate is determined.</P>
<P>Friday, <DATE>7th June.</DATE></P>
<P>I learn that many of our friends, who
are &s;uppo&s;ed to be inimical to the popular
cau&s;e, are al&s;o &s;ummoned by the Com|mittee
of Ob&s;ervation, &s;o that &s;uch con&s;o|lation
as can be derived from having a&s;&s;oci|ates
in difficulty will at lea&s;t be afforded me.
The concerns of the Loan Office, are of the
utmo&s;t importance to the public; and &s;ome
time will be ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, to adju&s;t
them with propriety. The ruling powers
will therefore, &s;urely, be convinced of the
nece&s;&s;ity of this mea&s;ure; and comply with
a requi&s;ition founded on rea&s;on, and pro|priety.
In that ca&s;e, a po&s;&s;ibility appears,
that an accommodation may be effected
<PB N="290" REF="338">
before the expiration of the term, which
may be allotted for the &s;ettlement of that
department; and we &s;hall, con&s;equently,
be rein&s;tated with every circum&s;tance of
advantage and reputation.</P>
<P>Sunday, <DATE>9th June.</DATE></P>
<P>We are in hourly expectation of &s;eeing
the &s;hip which is to convey the Governor
from this province; and though I am &s;o|licitous
to tran&s;mit the re&s;ult of Tue&s;day's
proceedings, yet, on his own account, I
am anxious for his immediate departure,
le&s;t any alteration &s;hould take place, which
may occa&s;ion his detention in Maryland.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t letter, I mentioned that it
was mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommended by Gene|ral
Lee, to &s;eize the per&s;on of the Gover|nor,
together with his papers and official
documents. The Congre&s;s have, al&s;o, in
&s;trong terms, urged the expediency of
<PB N="291" REF="339">
that mea&s;ure; and the Convention of Vir|ginia,
have likewi&s;e come to a &s;imilar re&s;o|lution;
which they have publi&s;hed to the
world; and which they are endeavouring
to enforce with all their power.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed in the re&s;olve
of that province, &s;ufficiently evince the
danger of delay, as they already appear to
operate, with great force, on the minds of
the multitude; and there are &s;ome who
publicly avow their opinion, that the com|munity
at large, are not bound to yield
their a&s;&s;ent to any proceedings of delegates,
which, in their con&s;equences, may be pre|judicial
to the general intere&s;ts of America.</P>
<P>That you may be enabled to form a
clear idea, under what embarra&s;&s;ing cir|cum&s;tances
the Governor is at pre&s;ent &s;itu|ated,

<OPENER>William&s;burg, Friday, <DATE>May 31, 1776.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;Re&s;olved, <HI>unanimou&s;ly,</HI> That the Com|mittee
of Safety be directed to write a let|ter
to the Pre&s;ident of the Convention of
Maryland, in an&s;wer to his letter of the

concern at the proceedings of that Con|vention,
re&s;pecting Governor Eden; and
our rea&s;ons for not becoming acce&s;&s;ary
thereto, by giving him a pa&s;&s;port through
this colony, or the bay adjoining: that
we would with reluctance, in any ca&s;e, in|termeddle
in the affairs of a &s;i&s;ter colony,
but in this matter we are much intere&s;ted;
and the Convention of Maryland, by &s;end|ing
their proceedings to the Committee of
Safety, have made it the duty of the Con|vention,
to declare their &s;entiments thereon.</P>

he is directed to give facility and a&s;&s;i&s;tance

Virginia, we are at a lo&s;s to account for
the Council of Safety of Maryland, their
having neglected to &s;eize him, according to
the recommendation of the general Con|gre&s;s;
and more &s;o for the Convention
having promoted his pa&s;&s;age, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in our
de&s;truction, under a pretence of his retir|ing
to England, which we conceive, from
the above letter, he is not at liberty to do;
that &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould go to Britain, it
appears to us, that &s;uch voyage, with the
addre&s;s pre&s;ented to him, will enable him to
a&s;&s;ume the character of a public agent, and
by promoting divi&s;ion among&s;t the colonies,
produce con&s;equences the mo&s;t fatal to the
American cau&s;e: that as the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned

under equal obligation to obey &s;uch man|dates.
We cannot avoid imputing the&s;e
proceedings to &s;ome undue influence of
Governor Eden, under the ma&s;k of friend|&s;hip
to America; and of the proprietary
intere&s;t in Maryland, whereby the members
of that Convention were betrayed into a
vote of fatal tendency to the common cau&s;e,

From the above it appears evident, that
my ob&s;ervations, re&s;pecting the temper and

the popular doctrines, and I fear
the number of pro&s;elytes is daily augment|ing.
The above appeal of the colony of

<P>&startq;You will plea&s;e,&endq; gentlemen, to ob|&s;erve,
that it is not ordered by the Con|vention,
that the Committees of Ob&s;erva|tion
take bonds of all non-a&s;&s;ociators, but
it is left to their di&s;cretion, whether to re|quire
bonds or not; and in the exerci&s;e of
<PB N="297" REF="345">
this power, though the committees are not
held, as magi&s;trates are in &s;imilar ca&s;es, by

they are bound in honour, not to demand
&s;ecurity unnece&s;&s;ary for the public good,

<P>&startq;From the above con&s;ideration we in|ferred,&endq;
on being required to give up our
arms, without any demand or hint re&s;pect|ing
the entering into bonds, that the Com|mittee

an opportunity of appealing immediately

body, we could have repre&s;ented our pecu|liar
circum&s;tances; that we are officers of

quarterly of our proceedings; and, that
though a corre&s;pondence of this nature
could be no way injurious to America, yet
it might, perhaps, be deemed a breach of
the propo&s;ed bond, and con&s;equently de|prive
us of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for
our&s;elves and families; for by the condi|tion
of this bond, &startq;no corre&s;pondence,
directly or indirectly, by letter, me&s;&s;age,
or otherwi&s;e, with any per&s;on holding a
civil office under the crown, is allowa|ble,&endq;
even a demand for, and receipt of
our &s;alaries, would be a breach of the con|dition
pre&s;cribed.</P>

therefore, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lea&s;t &s;hare of
rea&s;on, would con&s;ent to hazard &s;o great a
penalty, on behalf of men, who mu&s;t un|doubtedly
be guilty of perjury, &s;hould they
neglect an opportunity to convey intelli|gence.
Some of our friends, under &s;imi|lar
circum&s;tances, entertain an opinion,
<PB N="306" REF="354">
that when the Convention meet, they will
check the authority of the re&s;pective com|mittees,
and afford &s;ome indulgence to
tho&s;e who have been unnece&s;&s;arily oppre&s;&s;ed
by their power. For my part, I very lit|tle
rely on &s;uch delu&s;ive expectations. The
utmo&s;t moderation and temper, con&s;ider|ing
the complexion of the times, has, in|deed,
hitherto marked the proceedings of
that body; but violent and inflammatory
men, are now indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;training every
nerve, to excite general confu&s;ion, and
plunge us fatally deep in &s;chemes of inde|pendance.
From this powerful con&s;idera|tion,
I am decidedly of opinion that the Con|vention
will not hazard their influence, or
their popularity, by injudiciou&s;ly attempt|ing
to extend any indulgence to a de&s;crip|tion
of men, who are too generally pro|&s;cribed
as enemies to the freedom, and the
intere&s;ts of America.</P>

The in&s;tant the governor embarks, I
&s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h my temporary re&s;idence with
my worthy colleague and his family, and
with them &s;hall probably bid adieu to Ma|ryland,
and to a valuable circle of re&s;pec|table
connexions.</P>
<P>Sunday, <DATE>June 16.</DATE></P>
<P>Not any intelligence is yet received of the
expected &s;hip. The governor appears ra|ther
anxious for her arrival, and his friends
are &s;olicitous for his immediate departure,
as there are bu&s;y &s;pirits at work, who la|bour
to excite commotions with a view to
his detention.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be the general opinion, that
the colonies will &s;peedily be declared FREE
and INDEPENDENT STATES!&mdash;In that
ca&s;e what dreadful calamities mu&s;t inevit|ably
en&s;ue!&mdash;But &s;urely every weighty
rea&s;on &s;hould operate for po&s;tponing this
<PB N="308" REF="356">
mo&s;t important mea&s;ure, until the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
have made known the extent of
their powers, and the terms they are au|thorized
to propo&s;e. Should the colonies
be thus precipitate, Great Britain cannot
tamely admit the claim, and the &s;word
alone mu&s;t determine the fatal conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, I look forward with
extreme impatience to the hour of my de|parture
from this country, where every
&s;urrounding pro&s;pect is dreary and uncom|fortable.
It is probable I &s;hall be obliged
to go by the way of Nova Scotia. From
Hallifax, the capital of that province, I
&s;hall find frequent opportunities of a pa&s;|&s;age
to England; but from this place
&s;o few, that, after I am ready for em|barkation,
I may be detained many weeks
before I can be accommodated. But to
accompli&s;h my purpo&s;e, I mu&s;t obtain
permi&s;&s;ion to join the Briti&s;h fleet on the
<PB N="309" REF="357">
Virginia &s;tation, from which ve&s;&s;els are
frequently di&s;patched to the general ren|dezvous.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that this cour&s;e may prove
advantageous to our private concerns; and
I am confident our worthy friend the com|mi&s;&s;ary-general,
will exert his utmo&s;t en|deavours
to render my &s;ituation agreeable,
while I am nece&s;&s;arily detained in that part
of America. By the fir&s;t &s;hip after the
receipt of this, I reque&s;t you to inform
him that, &startq;as it is probable I &s;hall vi&s;it
his &s;tation previous to my return to Eu|rope,
I entreat him to take charge of
all letters that may be forwarded to his
care.&endq; He will gratify his own incli|nation
in rendering us every good office;
and on my interview with him, I may po&s;|&s;ibly
obtain &s;uch information as may enable
me to regulate my concerns, with a pro|per
attention to our mutual intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="358">
The convention are to meet on Wedne&s;|day,

that &s;ome important mea&s;ures will be de|termined
on by Congre&s;s, in which they
will be expected to acquie&s;ce. Indepen|dence
is the general cry of the infatuated
multitude: What effects may flow from
a proceeding of this nature, are dreadful to
imagine. Mo&s;t fervently do I wi&s;h the
governor &s;afe on board; for though the
convention, at their former &s;e&s;&s;ion, pledg|ed
their honour for his peaceable depar|ture,
they may, from an idea of ab&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity, think them&s;elves ju&s;tified in re|&s;cinding
that re&s;olution. The times are
&s;o dangerous and un&s;ettled, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to draw conclu&s;ions from pre&s;ent
appearances. Every countenance is cloud|ed
with &s;u&s;picion, and the warme&s;t attach|ments

apparently, continues ea&s;y and col|lected:

<P>La&s;t night the Fowey frigate, command|ed

in the cour&s;e of the day. Would he were

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>June 29, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>MY la&s;t, by the governor, will, I
tru&s;t, &s;afely reach you; but when an
opportunity may again offer to tran&s;mit in|telligence
of my &s;ituation, is indeed a mo&s;t
painful uncertainty. I &s;hall, neverthe|le&s;s,
occa&s;ionally re&s;ume the pen, as cir|cum&s;tances
may ari&s;e; and, as it is my
intent carefully to avoid commenting on po|litical
tran&s;actions, I hope not to encoun|ter
any hazard in the cour&s;e of our future
corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Till the moment of the governor's em|barkation
on the 23d, there was every
rea&s;on to apprehend a change of di&s;po&s;ition
to his prejudice. Some few were even cla|morous
for his detention. But the coun|cil
of &s;afety, who acted under a re&s;olve of
<PB N="313" REF="361">
the convention, generou&s;ly ratified the en|gagements
of that body; and after they
had taken an affectionate leave of their late
&s;upreme magi&s;trate, he was conducted to
the barge with every mark of re&s;pect due
to the elevated &s;tation he had &s;o worthily
filled.</P>
<P>A few minutes before his departure, I
received his &s;trict injunctions to be &s;teady
and cautious in the regulation of my con|duct;
and not to abandon my &s;ituation, on
any con&s;ideration, until ab&s;olutely di&s;|charged
by an authority which might, too
probably, be erected on the ruins of the
ancient con&s;titution. I promi&s;ed the mo&s;t
implicit attention to his &s;alutary advice;
and rendered my grateful acknowledgments
for the innumerable obligations he had
conferred on me; at the &s;ame time I of|fered
my mo&s;t fervent wi&s;hes, that his
future happine&s;s might be in full propor|tion
<PB N="314" REF="362">
to the integrity of his conduct, and
the benevolence of his mind.</P>
<P>In about an hour the barge reached the
Fowey, and the governor was received on
board under a di&s;charge of cannon: his
baggage and provi&s;ions were left on &s;hore,
to be forwarded in the cour&s;e of the en|&s;uing
day.</P>
<P>During the night, &s;ome &s;ervants, and
a &s;oldier, belonging to the Maryland regi|ment,
found means to e&s;cape on board his
Maje&s;ty's &s;hip, which being almo&s;t imme|diately
di&s;covered, a flag was &s;ent off, with
a me&s;&s;age, to captain Montague, demand|ing
the re&s;titution of the men, previous to
any further communication.</P>
<P>Captain Montague, in reply, acquainted
the council of &s;afety, &startq;that he could not,
con&s;i&s;tently with his duty, deliver up any
per&s;ons who, as &s;ubjects of his Britannic
<PB N="315" REF="363">
Maje&s;ty, had fled to him for refuge and
protection; that he had &s;trictly given it in
charge to &s;uch officers as might be &s;ent
on &s;hore, not to bring off any of the in|habitants
without the expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion
of the ruling powers; but that the ca&s;e
was extremely different re&s;pecting tho&s;e
who had, even at the hazard of life, given
evidence of their attachment to the an|cient
con&s;titution.&endq;</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age not being deemed &s;atisfac|tory,
a letter was di&s;patched to the gover|nor,
demanding his interference in this cri|tical
bu&s;ine&s;s, with an intimation, that the
detention of the men would be con&s;idered
as a manife&s;t breach of the regulations
under which flags of truce are e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Governor Eden received the officer with
proper attention, but replied, he had only
to ob&s;erve, that on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip,
he had not the lea&s;t authority; and that
<PB N="316" REF="364">
Captain Montague was not to be influenced
by his opinion, as he acted on principles
which he conceived to be &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent
with the line of his duty.</P>
<P>The event of this negotiation was di&s;|agreeable
in its con&s;equences to the gover|nor.
The populace were exceedingly irri|tated,
and it was thought expedient not
only to prohibit all further intercour&s;e with
the Fowey, but al&s;o to detain the various
&s;tores which the governor had provided for
his voyage to Europe. This re&s;olution
was intimated in expre&s;s terms; and, on
the evening of the 24th, Captain Mon|tague
weighed anchor, and &s;tood down
the bay, for his &s;tation on the coa&s;t of
Virginia.</P>
<P>This incident, incon&s;iderable as it may ap|pear,
will operate &s;trongly again&s;t tho&s;e who
have hitherto re&s;trained the impetuo&s;ity of
the popular zeal. The delegates in congre&s;s,
<PB N="317" REF="365">
for this province, have been in&s;tructed to
oppo&s;e the declaration of independence;
but it now appears almo&s;t a general opi|nion,
that Maryland will coincide in every
mea&s;ure which the uniting colonies may
think e&s;&s;ential for the intere&s;t and happi|ne&s;s
of the general community.</P>
<P><DATE>July 2.</DATE></P>
<P>The 31&s;t of the pre&s;ent month was the
extent of time limited for our continuance
in Maryland, by the committee of ob&s;er|vation,
in con&s;equence of our refu&s;al to
enter into the propo&s;ed bond. Con&s;cious
that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ettle the concerns
of the loan office with &s;atisfaction to the
public, to our &s;ecurities, and to our&s;elves,
within the term they had thought proper
to pre&s;cribe, Mr. C&mdash;and my&s;elf de|termined
to addre&s;s the convention imme|diately
on their meeting, for &s;uch relief as,
<PB N="318" REF="366">
on principles of ju&s;tice and equity, we
were entitled to demand.</P>
<P>We, accordingly, in firm, but re&s;pect|ful
terms, repre&s;ented our peculiar cir|cum&s;tances,
referring them to the me|morial
which had been pre&s;ented by us to
the committee of ob&s;ervation. On due
con&s;ideration it was agreed by both hou&s;es,
&startq;to depute &s;ome members of their body
to inve&s;tigate the accounts and tran&s;ac|tions
of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the loan of|fice,
to di&s;charge them from that impor|tant
tru&s;t, and to appoint others to &s;uc|ceed
them therein.&endq;</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this determination,
a con&s;iderable period may po&s;&s;ibly elap&s;e,
before this bu&s;ine&s;s will be finally adju&s;ted,
till which time we &s;hall be permitted to re|main
quietly in the country without any
further requi&s;ition to enter into engage|ments.
This undoubtedly is a great point
<PB N="319" REF="367">
gained in our favour, procra&s;tination being,
with us, an object of the utmo&s;t impor|tance.
A &s;hort time may be productive
of events conducive to public and private
tranquillity. &startq;Hope &s;prings eternal.&endq;
But were a judgment to be formed from
the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of political concerns,
every peaceful expectation mu&s;t be aban|doned.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>July 8th.</DATE></P>
<P>At length the deci&s;ive blow is &s;truck.
The colonies, by their delegates in con|gre&s;s,
are declared FREE AND INDEPEN|DENT
STATES, which great event took
place on the fourth in&s;tant! By this act
they have abjured all allegiance to the Bri|ti&s;h
crown; and have renounced every po|litical
connexion with the land from which
they derive their origin. The declaration
will &s;oon reach England, and will be found
to contain a long catalogue of grievances.
<PB N="320" REF="368">
This compo&s;ition, which is replete with
invective, is not more temperate than the
mea&s;ures which it profe&s;&s;es to defend.
What effect it will have on the councils
and operations of government, a &s;hort time
will po&s;&s;ibly determine.</P>
<P>I cannot but contemplate, with horror,
the complicated mi&s;eries which appear
ready to overwhelm this devoted country.
Thou&s;ands who, at this in&s;tant, are flu&s;hed
with hope, and exulting in a total &s;epara|tion
from the intere&s;ts of the parent &s;tate,
will, probably, before many months elap&s;e,
execrate the precipitation by which they
have been hurried into mea&s;ures fatally pre|judicial
to their repo&s;e and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Before you receive this, the particulars
of the action off Charles Town, in South
Carolina, on the 28th of June, will be in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of government. Our accounts &s;ay,
the Briti&s;h troops were totally defeated with
a prodigious lo&s;s, after many exertions per|fectly
<PB N="321" REF="369">
characteri&s;tic of the national bravery.
It is reported, that the quarter deck of
the Bri&s;tol was, at one time, cleared of
every per&s;on but the intrepid Sir Peter
Parker, who &s;tood alone, a &s;pectacle of he|roic
firmne&s;s never exceeded in military
hi&s;tory. Three of the Engli&s;h frigates,
by accident, or through the ignorance of
their pilot, were entangled in &s;ome &s;hoals,
where, for a long time, they appeared to
be immoveably fixed. With great damage
and difficulty, two were, at length, got
off; but not in a condition to render
any effectual &s;ervice. The Actaeon, of
twenty-eight guns, was burnt by her of|ficers
and crew, on the following morn|ing,
to prevent her falling into the hands
of the provincials, every effort having prov|ed
ineffectual to remove her from her &s;itu|ation.
This deci&s;ive victory, as it is here
termed, has given great &s;pirits to the ad|vocates
for the new government, and will
<PB N="322" REF="370">
tend to confirm them in their ho&s;tile di&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t this to a circuitous pa&s;&s;age. It
will be forwarded by the French i&s;lands.
Entertain not the mo&s;t di&s;tant apprehen|&s;ion
with re&s;pect to my &s;afety; I am treat|ed
with liberality and attention. When
&s;hall I again acknowledge a letter from

<P>Intelligence of a mo&s;t alarming nature

landed without oppo&s;ition, near Utrecht

Long I&s;land; and on the twenty-&s;eventh,

proved fatal to the arms of America. Par|ticulars
of the lo&s;s in killed, wounded,

Maryland has &s;uffered mo&s;t &s;everely

&s;uch con&s;equences as might naturally be

on this very intere&s;ting occa&s;ion; and the
report they have made to Congre&s;s on the
&s;ubject of their conference has totally de|&s;troyed
every plea&s;ing idea of a pacific
treaty.</P>
<P>The following are the words in which
the Committee have thought proper to
&s;um up the particulars of their late nego|tiation;
and I &s;hall only add on the &s;ub|ject,
that rea&s;ons are from this deduced,

again&s;t the power and authority of
the mother country.</P>
<P>&startq;Upon the whole, it did not appear to
your Committee, that his Lord&s;hip's
commi&s;&s;ion contained any other autho|rity
of importance, than what is con|tained
in the act of Parliament, viz.
that of granting pardons, with &s;uch ex|ceptions
as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall think
proper to make; and of declaring Ame|rica,
or any part of it, to be in the
King's peace upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: for as to
the power of inquiring into the &s;tate of
America, which his Lord&s;hip mentioned
to us, and of conferring and con&s;ulting
with any per&s;ons the commi&s;&s;ioners
might think proper; and repre&s;enting
the re&s;ult of &s;uch conver&s;ations to the
mini&s;try, who (provided the colonies
would &s;ubject them&s;elves,) might, after
<PB N="331" REF="379">
all, or might not, at their plea&s;ure,
make any alterations in the former in|&s;tructions
to governors, or propo&s;e in
parliament any amendment of the acts
complained of, we apprehend any ex|pectation
from the effect of &s;uch a power,
would have been too uncertain and pre|carious

<P>The city of New York is in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion

of that capital, and talk of maintaining
their ground till reinforcements arrive,
which may enable them to retrieve, with

<P>Though the declaration of independence
was made on the fourth of July la&s;t, the
form of government, with re&s;pect to Ma|ryland
is, by no means finally adju&s;ted;
and from the delay which has been evi|dent
in the proceedings of our Convention,
and the committees &s;ubordinate to their
direction, I cannot but indulge the plea&s;|ing
idea, in &s;pite of ho&s;tile operations, that
the moderate and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, who are
included in tho&s;e bodies, have &s;till &s;ufficient
influence to retard an ab&s;olute e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of the new con&s;titution; while the
mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;&s;ibility remains of a recon|ciliation
being effected.</P>
<P>The committee appointed to inve&s;tigate
the accounts of the loan office, al&s;o ap|pear
dilatory in bringing the affairs of that
department to a conclu&s;ion; and you very
<PB N="333" REF="381">
well know how particularly I am engaged,
both in honour and gratitude, to obtain an
ample and proper di&s;charge from an em|ployment
of &s;o much importance to the
community.</P>
<P>From the pre&s;ent political appearances,
I cannot but indulge an opinion, that our
legi&s;lative body will not proceed with ala|crity
in the pro&s;ecution of this bu&s;ine&s;s.
A &s;hort&mdash;a very &s;hort time, will probably
determine how far the colonies are enabled
to &s;upport coercive mea&s;ures again&s;t the
formidable exertions of the Briti&s;h nation;
and &s;hould the lea&s;t pro&s;pect appear of re|turning
peace, it would be impolitic and
fruitle&s;s to di&s;charge officers who would im|mediately
be rein&s;tated with advantage, on
affairs reverting into the ancient channel.</P>
<P>My worthy colleague and his family are
preparing to remove from Annapolis to a
hou&s;e belonging to Mr. D&mdash;, on
Hunting Ridge, about &s;ix miles di&s;tant
<PB N="334" REF="382">
from Baltimore, to which place I intend
to accompany them. We propo&s;e to at|tend

<P>I write to you from one of the mo&s;t de|lightful
&s;ituations on the continent of Ame|rica,
where I have obtained an occa&s;ional
retreat from the noi&s;e, the tumult, and the
mi&s;eries of the public world. From the
back piazza of our habitation, we com|mand
a truly picture&s;que view into &s;everal
fertile counties; a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of the
ea&s;tern &s;hore; the magnificent waters of
the Che&s;apeak, and the river Patap&s;co,
from the entrance at the Bodkin Point, to
its apparent termination at the town of
Baltimore. After this inadequate de&s;crip|tion,
I need not ob&s;erve, that we re&s;ide on
a lofty eminence, where
<Q><PB N="335" REF="383">
<L>&startq;&mdash;the air</L>
<L>Nimbly, and &s;weetly recommends it&s;elf</L>
<L>Unto our gentle &s;en&s;es.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>As Mr. C&mdash;and my&s;elf are not yet
&s;uperceded in our office, we attend in ro|tation,
every other week, in Annapolis, from
which this place is about thirty miles di&s;|tant.
The contra&s;t we experience on the&s;e
occa&s;ions, is hardly to be de&s;cribed; from the
churli&s;h &s;ounds of ho&s;tile preparation to the
calm enjoyments of peaceful retirement.
Though in the vicinity of a large and popu|lous
town, agitated with uproar and confu|&s;ion,
and rumours of approaching calamities,
here, &s;heltered by &s;urrounding woods, we
are entirely &s;ecluded &startq;from the bu&s;y haunts
of men,&endq; and are benevolently permitted
to enjoy our retirement without dread
of mole&s;tation. It is well known that we
have never attempted, by any injudicious
&s;teps, to incur the re&s;entment of tho&s;e
who conceive they are warranted by ju&s;tice
<PB N="336" REF="384">
and by duty, to take a contrary part; and
while we thus continue to regulate our
conduct, we &s;hall &s;urely experience atten|tion,
with the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity.</P>

<P>The whole of York I&s;land is in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's forces. General
Howe has, for &s;ome time, been attempting
to force General Wa&s;hington to a deci&s;ive
action, which he has, hitherto, avoided
with the penetration of a Fabius. Sir
William, finding every well-concerted effort
ineffectual to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e, has
directed his arms again&s;t the garri&s;on left
for the defence of Fort Wa&s;hington, a very
&s;trong po&s;t, &s;ituated on a lofty eminence,
and to which the approaches were ex|tremely
difficult.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of November, the
provincial commander was &s;ummoned to
<PB N="337" REF="385">
&s;urrender, which he refu&s;ed to do, in the
mo&s;t peremptory terms, declaring he would
defend his &s;tation to the la&s;t extremity. A
general a&s;&s;ault was, in con&s;equence, deter|mined
upon, which took place on the &s;ix|teenth,
when the fort was carried, after a
&s;pirited defence; and the garri&s;on, con|&s;i&s;ting
of near three thou&s;and men, became
pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth, Lord Cornwallis,
with a &s;trong detachment, pa&s;&s;ed the north
river, in order to attack Fort Lee, and to
make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion in the Jer&s;eys, in
which undertaking he was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful,
that the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of about two
thou&s;and men, had a very narrow e&s;cape,
by abandoning the po&s;t immediately before
his Lord&s;hip's arrival, leaving their artil|lery,
&s;tores, and tents behind them.</P>
<P>For the particulars of the&s;e important
tran&s;actions, I &s;hall refer you to the ac|counts
<PB N="338" REF="386">
tran&s;mitted home to admini&s;tration;
and have only to offer my mo&s;t fervent
prayers, that the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;es which
have hitherto attended the Briti&s;h arms,
may be productive of an honourable, and
permanent reconciliation, founded on &s;uch
principles as may &s;ecure to America the

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 1, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>SINCE the day our hearts and inte|re&s;ts
were united, frequent occa&s;ions
have been afforded for the exerci&s;e of our
fortitude and re&s;ignation, and by the ble&s;|&s;ing
of Heaven, we have, hitherto, been
&s;afely conducted through every vici&s;&s;itude.
Let us then take courage from pa&s;t expe|rience.
The year opens with the mo&s;t
dreary pro&s;pects. The recent event of
Trenton, will add &s;trength to the &s;inews
of war, and cruelly procra&s;tinate the wi&s;hed
return of peace.</P>
<P>The capture of Rhode I&s;land, which
happened on the eighth of December;
and the &s;urpri&s;ing of General Lee, on the
thirteenth, by Colonel Harcourt, were cir|circum&s;tances
<PB N="340" REF="388">
which excited &s;anguine hopes
in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who per&s;evered in
their attachment to the ancient con&s;titu|tion;
and the&s;e hopes were encouraged by
a &s;trong probability, that Philadelphia mu&s;t
&s;peedily follow the fortune of New York,
the Delaware being the only apparent ob|&s;tacle
that &s;eemed likely to oppo&s;e the
progre&s;s of the royal arms.</P>
<P>The provincial forces, who were only
enli&s;ted for a &s;tipulated time, di&s;couraged
by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of unfavourable events, were
&s;o greatly reduced in their numbers, that
it is a&s;&s;erted, on the day preceding the af|fair
at Trenton, the mu&s;ter roll &s;carcely
exceeded three thou&s;and men; and the
greater part of tho&s;e were anxious for the
expiration of their term, that they might
return to their families, and their accu&s;|tomed
vocations. The Congre&s;s, from a
well-founded apprehen&s;ion of danger, re|treated
<PB N="341" REF="389">
with precipitation to Baltimore;
and many who had been mo&s;t zealous in
promoting ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, began to avow
&s;entiments of a conciliatory nature; in a
word, the general di&s;po&s;ition of the colo|nies
tended to a reconciliation, and even
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the provinces
was daily expected.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this promi&s;ing train,
when the American general planned, and
executed the late important enterpri&s;e.
Trifling as this manoeuvre might have
been con&s;idered, in the pro&s;ecution of a re|gular
war, it has been, in this in&s;tance, at|tended
with the mo&s;t prejudicial and alarm|ing
con&s;equences to his Maje&s;ty's arms.
It has given &s;pirits to tho&s;e who &s;hewed
the utmo&s;t de&s;pondency; it has recruited
the enfeebled ranks; and it has enabled
the enthu&s;ia&s;tic leaders to magnify, in the
mo&s;t exaggerated terms, the advantages
<PB N="342" REF="390">
that mu&s;t inevitably ari&s;e from the &s;ucce&s;s
of this brilliant exertion.</P>
<P>To many it has appeared extraordinary,
that the advanced po&s;t was occupied by
He&s;&s;ian regiments, who might rea&s;onably
be &s;uppo&s;ed le&s;s competent than Bri|ti&s;h,
to determine on the authenticity
of intelligence, or the di&s;po&s;ition of the
coloni&s;ts, with re&s;pect to political attach|ment.
But how far cen&s;ure is well found|ed,
it becomes not an individual to deter|mine.
It ought rather to be concluded,
that tho&s;e arrangements took place, which
on mature reflection, apparently, led to the
advancement of the general &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The mode hitherto adopted by Congre&s;s,
in conducting their enli&s;tments, has been
found &s;o inadequate to every e&s;&s;ential pur|po&s;e,
that they have concluded on adopt|ing
a different one, which affords the pro|bability
of a permanent army, under the
<PB N="343" REF="391">
mo&s;t &s;trict and regular military di&s;cipline.
Hitherto their troops have been rai&s;ed with
a condition of receiving their di&s;charge at
the expiration of twelve months; and they
conceived, that this rotation of duty would
occa&s;ion the weight to fall le&s;s heavy on
the general community. But &s;uch a con|tinual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men, unexperienced,
and impatient of re&s;traint, has rather im|peded
than promoted the &s;ucce&s;s of their
operations. It is therefore re&s;olved, to
pro&s;ecute the new levies on a &s;ettled e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.
Tho&s;e who engage to enli&s;t
during the continuance of the war, are to
have an immediate bounty of twenty dol|lars;
and one hundred acres of land each,
at the expiration of their &s;ervice. Officers
are to be rewarded in proportion to their
re&s;pective &s;ituations. Others are admitted
for the &s;tipulated term of three years, who
are to receive the &s;ame bounty, without
any landed compen&s;ation. By this regula|tion,
<PB N="344" REF="392">
it is &s;uppo&s;ed a very formidable army
will be ready to take the field early in the
en&s;uing &s;pring, under a commander who
has in&s;pired every adherent to the mea|&s;ures
of Congre&s;s, with the mo&s;t unlimited
confidence in his &s;uperior abilities.</P>
<P>It is confidently a&s;&s;erted, and it appears
to be univer&s;ally believed, that General
Wa&s;hington will quickly be enabled to
repo&s;&s;e&s;s the Jer&s;eys, and to contract the
Briti&s;h po&s;ts into a very limited &s;phere of
action. This is certain, that apprehen|&s;ions
re&s;pecting Philadelphia, are no longer
&s;eriou&s;ly entertained, Congre&s;s having it
in contemplation, &s;peedily to re&s;ume their
deliberations in that city.</P>
<P>My&s;elf and colleague, are not yet &s;uper|ceded
in our provincial employment; but
the day is a&s;&s;uredly at hand. When that
event has taken place, I am per&s;uaded I
&s;hall be at liberty to revi&s;it England; and
<PB N="345" REF="393">
have rea&s;on to believe, I &s;hall be nece&s;&s;i|tated
to &s;hape my cour&s;e by way of the
We&s;t Indies. I think it po&s;&s;ible we may
be re&s;tored to each other early in the en|&s;uing
&s;ummer.</P>
<P>It has been a matter of &s;urpri&s;e to many,
that the capes of Virginia have, in a great
mea&s;ure, been left open, &s;ince the depar|ture
of Lord Dunmore and his fleet from
the Che&s;apeak. In con&s;equence of this
apparent remi&s;sne&s;s, on the part of the
Briti&s;h cruizers, a con&s;iderable commerce
is carried on, with very little interruption,
between Virginia and Maryland, and the
French and Dutch i&s;lands, and even with
&s;everal ports on the continent of Europe.
Tho&s;e who continue attached to the inte|re&s;t
of Britain, behold, with infinite con|cern,
many valuable prizes continually
brought into American harbours, by pri|vateers
&s;o incon&s;iderable in appearance, that
<PB N="346" REF="394">
they might readily be mi&s;taken for boats
belonging to the ve&s;&s;els they were tri|umphantly
conducting. Almo&s;t all the
&s;hips which have hitherto been taken, had
not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of danger,
con&s;equently were not prepared for re|&s;i&s;tance;
and if a certain judgment may
be formed from the &s;ucce&s;s which has at|tended
the adventurers from this, and the
adjacent colony, Great Britain mu&s;t &s;en&s;i|bly
experience the lo&s;s &s;he has already &s;u&s;|tained,
by the rapid and &s;pirited exertions,
which have been &s;o unexpectedly directed
again&s;t her commerce.</P>
<P>The exorbitant price of almo&s;t every
e&s;&s;ential article, exceeds credibility. Tho&s;e
few who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;pecie, do not
permit it to circulate; and the con&s;tant
depreciation of the paper currency, baffles
every attempt of the legi&s;lature to &s;upport
its credit; yet, in &s;pite of every apparently
<PB N="347" REF="395">
in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle, the utmo&s;t ala|crity
appears for the pro&s;ecution of the
war; and the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes are
evidently entertained, that the political
connexion between Great Britain and Ame|rica,
is finally and effectually di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The internal government of Maryland,
is not yet perfectly adju&s;ted, but the ar|rangements,
under the new con&s;titution,
are in great forwardne&s;s, and will &s;peedily
take place in the various departments. Our
di&s;charge will, undoubtedly, immediately
follow, and we &s;hall be free to &s;hape our
cour&s;e as providence may direct.</P>
<P>When we again meet, I tru&s;t we &s;hall
find friends, &startq;though they grow not
thick on every bough,&endq; who will pro|mote
our endeavours to obtain a compe|tent
maintenance. Under all the varied
circum&s;tances of life, we will &s;teadily la|bour
to merit &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;hould our be&s;t
<PB N="348" REF="396">
endeavours be fru&s;trated, we &s;hall, at
lea&s;t, be exempt from &s;elf-accu&s;ation, and
can derive no little &s;atisfaction, from a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that our &s;ufferings are not
the bitter fruits of di&s;&s;ipation or mi&s;con|duct.</P>

<P>Ye&s;terday I received my pa&s;&s;port, and
wait only the arrival of the po&s;t on Friday
to determine my cour&s;e. I have written
to my friend Mr. C&mdash;, who is a mem|ber
of congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject of obtain|ing
permi&s;&s;ion to enter the Briti&s;h lines;
and have repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t terms
I was able, &startq;the peculiarity of my &s;itua|tion,
and my total incapacity to &s;upport
the heavy additional expen&s;e which mu&s;t
attend a voyage to Europe by way of
the I&s;lands: I have al&s;o urged dome&s;tic
motives: in &s;hort, I have &s;ugge&s;ted
every rea&s;on which can induce compli|ance;
I have even reque&s;ted to be con|&s;idered
as a pri&s;oner upon parole, and
<PB N="355" REF="403">
have offered to remain in Philadelphia,
or in &s;ome American po&s;t, until I can,
by application to my friends in New
York, obtain &s;ome per&s;on, in a civil ca|pacity,
to be exchanged for me.&endq;</P>
<P>Should I &s;ucceed in this attempt, it is
po&s;&s;ible I may be relieved, in a few days,
from a &s;tate of inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety, by re|ceiving
intelligence re&s;pecting tho&s;e who

the di&s;appointment with fortitude, &s;up|ported
by the reflection, that I have di|rected
my be&s;t efforts to the accompli&s;h|ment
of my wi&s;hes; and that the failure
has not proceeded from any neglect on my
part, or any impropriety of conduct. At

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>On board his Maje&s;ty's Ship Emerald,
Capes of Virginia, <DATE>July 2, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>AFTER encountering a variety of
perplexing and vexatious circum|&s;tances,
I have been met with &s;ucce&s;s
beyond my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations.
The mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pects are opening
to my view; and I &s;hall &s;peedily obtain
ample compen&s;ation for tho&s;e various anx|ieties
which have &s;o long di&s;turbed my
repo&s;e.</P>
<P>My la&s;t intimated that I had taken my
pa&s;&s;age from Maryland, in a ve&s;&s;el bound
to Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, in the i&s;land of Hi&s;pa|niola.
On the evening of the &s;eventh of
June, I took an affectionate leave of our
few Annapolitan friends; and, I need not
&s;ay, &s;uch were my &s;en&s;ations on the occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="361" REF="409">
that I repaired on board the &s;hip de&s;|tined
to convey me from that province, with
a mind greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and agitated.</P>
<P>It would have evinced the utmo&s;t in|&s;en&s;ibility
to have quitted without &s;uch
feelings, the &s;cene of former happine&s;s and
pro&s;perity. I reflected on the obligations
we had received; the benefits we had ex|perienced,
and the connexions we had
formed. I could not re&s;i&s;t the united im|pre&s;&s;ions
excited by &s;uch intere&s;ting ideas;
nor did I quit my pen&s;ive &s;tation on the
deck, while a &s;ingle object could be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
that &s;o forcibly reminded me of
pa&s;t felicity.</P>
<P>Soon as the day dawned on the eighth,
we weighed anchor, and &s;tood down the
bay with a propitious gale. I found two
gentlemen on board, proprietors of the ve&s;|&s;el
and cargo; knowing them well, I pro|mi&s;ed
my&s;elf great &s;atisfaction from their
<PB N="362" REF="410">
&s;ociety, and my expectations were com|pletely
gratified.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed the mouth of Patuxent,
I beheld, with emotions of gratitude, the
ho&s;pitable man&s;ion of our benevolent friend.
Tho&s;e doors which ever opened with equal
alacrity, to the weary traveller, and to the
opulent gue&s;t, are now for&s;aken, even by
the generous worthy owner!&mdash;The colo|nel,
his lady and family, are retired into
the interior country, that they may be fur|ther
removed from the inevitable calami|ties
of war.</P>
<P>Our pa&s;&s;age down the bay was tedious;
the winds proving variable. On Saturday
the 14th, when we were &s;tanding in for
York River, in order to obtain informa|tion,
and to avail our&s;elves of a proper
opportunity to pro&s;ecute our cour&s;e, we
de&s;cried a Briti&s;h &s;hip in cha&s;e of an Ame|rican
&s;loop. My &s;en&s;ations on this occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="363" REF="411">
were &s;uch as I cannot po&s;&s;ibly deli|neate;
and I could &s;carce refrain expre&s;|&s;ing
a wi&s;h, that the Engli&s;h colours were
flying on our en&s;ign &s;taff. The ma&s;ter of
our ve&s;&s;el, and my fellow pa&s;&s;engers were,
for &s;ome time, apprehen&s;ive of danger;
and I believe we were greatly indebted for
our e&s;cape to &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;hoals,
which rendered the navigation extremely
intricate and dangerous. Our captain being
an expert &s;eaman, profited by the advan|tages
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and, in a &s;hort time,
we were &s;afely at an anchor, oppo&s;ite to the
town of York, and clo&s;e beneath the &s;tern
of an American frigate.</P>
<P>My companions, though well inclined
to government, expre&s;&s;ed much &s;atisfac|tion
on finding them&s;elves &s;ecure within
the limits of an American port, for had
they been captured, notwith&s;tanding their
&s;entiments were loyal, their property would
<PB N="364" REF="412">
have been ju&s;tly forfeited, as they were
attempting to &s;upport an illicit commerce.
To this mea&s;ure they were, however, re|duced
by ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity; it was the
only means they could po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e to
quit their wretched country, without em|barra&s;&s;ing
their friends and relatives, who
were compelled, by unavoidable circum|&s;tances,
to continue in the province.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen finding the capes ef|fectually
guarded by &s;everal of his Maje&s;|ty's
&s;hips, and being, con&s;equently, con|vinced
that it was impracticable to pa&s;s
them with any degree of &s;afety, deter|mined
to remain in Virginia, until a more
favourable opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf.
This determination by no means accorded
with my wi&s;hes. The lea&s;t detention ap|peared
ho&s;tile to my happine&s;s; and under
my peculiar circum&s;tances, if no motives
of a &s;uperior nature had operated, I could
<PB N="365" REF="413">
not &s;upport, without the greate&s;t incon|venience,
the accumulated expence which
unavoidably mu&s;t have attended &s;uch a
mea&s;ure. I therefore began to devi&s;e &s;ome
proper method of abandoning a &s;ituation
which threatened a tedious and painful ob|&s;truction
to the renewal of our dome&s;tic
intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>Animated by &s;uch con&s;iderations, I re|&s;olved
on an immediate application to the
officer, who commanded the provincial
troops in that di&s;trict. To this gentleman
I explained my particular &s;ituation, with|out
the lea&s;t re&s;erve: the pre&s;&s;ing motives
which required my immediate pre&s;ence in
England: the di&s;appointment I had &s;u&s;|tained
by the detention of our ve&s;&s;el, and
the advantages which would ari&s;e to me by
a permi&s;&s;ion to be put on board one of the
Briti&s;h cruizers, from whence, by way of
New York, I might obtain a &s;peedy con|veyance
<PB N="366" REF="414">
to my family and connexions in
Europe. To corroborate a&s;&s;ertions, found|ed
on the &s;tricte&s;t truth, I &s;ubmitted to
his con&s;ideration the pa&s;&s;port which had
been granted to me by the ruling powers
in Maryland.</P>
<P>I was heard by this officer with candid
attention, and the propriety of my plea was
readily admitted&mdash;he could not conceive
the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting a di&s;tant opportu|nity,
or of pro&s;ecuting my voyage by way
of the We&s;t Indies, therefore advi&s;ed me
to proceed immediately to Hampton, where
&s;ome Virginian gentlemen, adherents to
the former government, were on the point
of embarking for New York, under the
operation of an act of their legi&s;lature; and
he was per&s;uaded, on an explicit repre&s;en|tation
of my ca&s;e, I &s;hould not find any
difficulty in being permitted to avail my|&s;elf
of the benefit of the flag, under the
<PB N="367" REF="415">
protection of which tho&s;e per&s;ons were pre|paring
to quit the colony.</P>
<P>You will admit that I di&s;patched this
important concern with becoming &s;pirit
and expedition, for on Monday the 16th,
I exchanged reciprocal wi&s;hes with my
Maryland friends, and left them to pur&s;ue
fortune agreeably to the mode they had
adopted.</P>
<P>About noon, the weather being inten&s;ely
hot, I embarked in a &s;mall open boat for
the place of my de&s;tination, which was
about ten leagues nearer to the &s;ea. The
capes opened to our view a con&s;iderable
time before we obtained &s;ight of Hampton,
and I anticipated the happine&s;s I expected
&s;hortly to experience, by pa&s;&s;ing them on
a more eligible plan than nece&s;&s;ity had ori|ginally
&s;ugge&s;ted. I fondly conceived that
I had almo&s;t &s;urmounted every difficulty,
and could not avoid congratulating my|&s;elf
<PB N="368" REF="416">
on the happy addre&s;s by which I had
&s;o fortunately converted an apparent di&s;ap|pointment
into &s;uch real advantage. Sup|ported
by the&s;e ideas, I experienced but
little inconvenience during &s;everal hours
that I was confined in a very limited and
expo&s;ed &s;ituation; and &s;carcely had I reach|ed
my de&s;ired harbour, where a new &s;cene
of operations was to commence, before
a tremendous gale aro&s;e, which raged
for &s;everal hours with incredible violence,
and threatened inevitable de&s;truction to
tho&s;e who were expo&s;ed to its fury. Per|haps
I was wrong: but I could not avoid
drawing the mo&s;t favourable conclu&s;ions
from this dreadful elementary war: I con|&s;idered
my e&s;cape as an undoubted prelude
to future pro&s;perity; and I experienced a
confidence in my mind which led me boldly
forward to the completion of my arduous
de&s;ign. But &s;carce had I landed on the
beach ere I experienced a di&s;appointment
<PB N="369" REF="417">
which overthrew all my late hopes. Tho&s;e
gentlemen, in who&s;e fortune I tru&s;ted to
have participated, and for which pur|po&s;e
I had &s;trained my utmo&s;t abilities,
and hazarded the mo&s;t imminent danger,
were embarked the preceding evening, and
left melancholy impre&s;&s;ions on the minds
of their friends, on account of the &s;udden,
and violent tempe&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The author had the &s;atisfaction to learn, on his ar|rival at New York, that they had &s;afely accompli&s;hed their pa&s;&s;age.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>How to extricate my&s;elf from the difficul|ties
which now &s;urrounded me I knew not.
I was in a place where I had not the &s;lighte&s;t
connexion; and where the appearance of a
&s;tranger was a &s;ufficient motive to excite
&s;u&s;picion. Time, however, was precious:
I therefore determined not to lo&s;e a mo|ment.
It was generally known in Mary|land
that I had taken my pa&s;&s;age by way
of the i&s;lands; and it was po&s;&s;ible I might
<PB N="370" REF="418">
meet &s;ome per&s;on from that province,
who would throw in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles
in my way, by repre&s;enting my intentions
in an unfavourable point of view. Agi|tated
by &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, and encou|raged
by the &s;ucce&s;s which had attended
my application at York Town, I waited
in&s;tantly on the commanding officer, and,
a&s;&s;uming a confidence nece&s;&s;ary in my &s;itu|ation,
intimated the circum&s;tances of my
di&s;appointment, by the nece&s;&s;ity of taking
&s;helter in York River; the motives which
had brought me to that place, in con&s;e|quence
of it, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible mor|tification
I had experienced by arriving too
late to avail my&s;elf of &s;o favourable an op|portunity.
I therefore entreated that he
would facilitate a re-union with my family
and connexions, by granting me the in|dulgence
of a flag, under the conduct of
which I might obtain a temporary &s;ituation
on board one of the Briti&s;h &s;hips &s;tationed
<PB N="371" REF="419">
in the vicinity of the capes, until an op|portunity
offered to convey me to &s;ome
port, from whence I might find a ready
pa&s;&s;age to England.</P>
<P>From the commencement of the war,
I had e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a fixed principle,
that they who were actually engaged in
ho&s;tile oppo&s;ition, were directed by more
liberal &s;entiments than tho&s;e inflammatory
demagogues, who had ari&s;en to eminence
by fomenting di&s;contents, and taking a
di&s;tingui&s;hed lead in popular a&s;&s;emblies;
and experience, on various occa&s;ions, has
fully confirmed the truth of this ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>In Hampton, fortunately for me, all
public affairs were under military directi|on:
the per&s;on who commanded, attended
with complacency to my application; and
expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t &s;ollicitude to render
<PB N="372" REF="420">
me every po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice con&s;i&s;tent with
his duty.</P>
<P>On the following day (the 17th) this
bu&s;ine&s;s was more fully inve&s;tigated in pre|&s;ence
of the officer who directed the marine
department; and, on my delivering the
pa&s;&s;port, which had been granted for my
departure from Maryland, no rea&s;ons ap|peared
to operate again&s;t compliance with
my reque&s;t; therefore to my inexpre&s;&s;ible
joy, leave was immediately granted to en|gage
a ve&s;&s;el for my pa&s;&s;age, and a gen|tleman
was deputed to attend me with a
flag, as &s;oon as I gave intimation that I
was ready for my departure.</P>
<P>Favourable as appearances now were, it
was my fate &s;till to encounter di&s;appoint|ment:
I found infinite difficulty in pro|curing
a boat, from a &s;ettled per&s;ua&s;ion
that, notwith&s;tanding a flag was granted,
it was dangerous to rely on that privilege.
<PB N="373" REF="421">
Every hour's delay increa&s;ed my di&s;quie|tude;
yet it was not until about noon on
the 20th, that I was able to accompli&s;h
my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements for
our departure were made, I rendered my
grateful acknowledgments where they were
&s;o ju&s;tly due, and, accompanied by the
officer who was appointed to conduct me,
repaired to the landing place, where a ve&s;|&s;el
was waiting for our reception. Unfor|tunately
at that critical period, the wind
fre&s;hened to a perfect gale; the &s;ea run
high, and my companion, from an appre|hen&s;ion
of danger, intimated his re&s;olution
to po&s;tpone the undertaking till the wea|ther
was more moderate. It was in vain
that I urged every motive to alter his
determination; my be&s;t arguments were
ineffectual; and, with inexpre&s;&s;ible re|luctance,
I was obliged to relinqui&s;h my
<PB N="374" REF="422">
de&s;ign, and wait the event of the en&s;uing
day.</P>
<P>Anxious with re&s;pect to the great con|cern
which occupied my mind, a &s;hort time
before &s;un&s;et I repaired to the harbour, to
gain information relative to the &s;tate of
the weather, and the probable time when
it might be advi&s;eable to re&s;ume our un|dertaking.
The per&s;on, who&s;e &s;chooner I
had engaged, comforted me with the mo&s;t
favourable intelligence, and advi&s;ed me to
be on board by the dawn of day, that ad|vantage
might be derived from the land
breeze, which generally prevailed at that
&s;ea&s;on of the year, till the &s;un had at|tained
a con&s;iderable height above the ho|rizon.
With alacrity I ha&s;tened to com|municate
the&s;e particulars to the officer
who had been appointed to attend me,
when I received intelligence which di&s;con|certed
every plan, and pre&s;ented to my de|jected
<PB N="375" REF="423">
view, a gloomy pro&s;pect of in&s;ur|mountable
difficulties. In &s;hort, he in|formed
me, that the battalion then quar|tered
in Hampton, had that in&s;tant re|ceived
orders to march, early on the fol|lowing
morning, to join the grand army
under command of General Wa&s;hington;
and that con&s;equently he could not gratify
his own feelings by forwarding my inten|tions
of quitting America.</P>
<P>This intimation, &s;o &s;udden, &s;o unex|pected,
affected my mind in the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible
manner. The officer to whom I had
delivered my pa&s;&s;port, had already taken
his departure, and though I could obtain
evidence that I had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
&s;uch a credential, yet I might have to ne|gotiate
with people of a le&s;s liberal and
more &s;u&s;picious nature. Part of another
regiment was hourly expected, to the com|manding
officer of which I &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;itated
<PB N="376" REF="424">
to renew my application. Delay,
in every point of view, being replete with
danger, I ha&s;tened back to the wharf, and
candidly acquainted the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;|&s;el
with the foregoing circum&s;tances, re|minding
him that, as a full authority &s;till
exi&s;ted for his receiving me on board, he
could not po&s;&s;ibly incur any cen&s;ure by the
pro&s;ecution of our de&s;ign, as &s;oon as the
favourable moment offered to proceed on
our de&s;tined cour&s;e.</P>
<P>My arguments, though &s;trongly urged,
did not appear to produce conviction; he
conceived a flag was ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to
protect him from being captured; and
that by venturing to conduct me without
that &s;ecurity, he might entail ruin on him|&s;elf
and family. I attempted to combat
his objections, by alleging, that the very
circum&s;tance of conveying a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject,
who had undoubted credentials to
<PB N="377" REF="425">
&s;ecure the mo&s;t favourable reception, would
effectually prevent any con&s;equences pre|judicial
to his &s;afety or his intere&s;t. I re|mon&s;trated
to the wind; he appeared in|flexibly
determined; and it was, with the
utmo&s;t difficulty, that at length I per&s;uaded
him to reflect maturely on the rea&s;ons I
had advanced, and to give me, within two
hours, his ultimate re&s;olution.</P>
<P>You will readily conceive the agitation
of my mind during this painful interval,
e&s;pecially as a hint had been given me, that
the officer who commanded the gallies,
and who, on repeated occa&s;ions, had ap|proved
him&s;elf a zealous partizan, had,
in the cour&s;e of the day, intimated an al|teration
of &s;entiment, relative to the mea|&s;ures
nece&s;&s;ary to be pur&s;ued, previous to
my departure from the colony. This offi|cer
&s;eemed to apprehend an application
ought to be made, on my part, to the legi&s;|lative
<PB N="378" REF="426">
authority; and that the permi&s;&s;ion
which had been granted was in&s;ufficient,
without the &s;anction of the civil power.
A journey to William&s;burgh mu&s;t have
been the con&s;equence of &s;uch an opinion
being adopted; and, perhaps, even then,
on repre&s;enting my &s;ituation to the Coun|cil
of Safety in that city, it might have
been thought expedient to apply to the
government of Maryland, for authentic
documents to corroborate my a&s;&s;ertions.
Such a proceeding mu&s;t, inevitably, have
been attended with a tedious delay, and
with increa&s;ed expence; not to mention
the &s;trong probability, that a po&s;itive pro|hibition
would have been the con&s;equence
of &s;uch a reference.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e peculiar circum&s;tances it was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>I</HI> &s;hould appear
perfectly collected, in order to remove all
&s;u&s;picion of my pur&s;uing indirect mea&s;ures
<PB N="379" REF="427">
to accompli&s;h my purpo&s;e. I therefore
joined a party, with whom I had occa|&s;ionally
a&s;&s;ociated &s;ince my re&s;idence in
Hampton, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with them the
circum&s;tance of the &s;udden departure of
the battalion, and the objections unexpect|edly
&s;tarted by the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el,
again&s;t receiving me without the formality
of a flag. I acquainted them, that an offi|cer
had accompanied me to the wharf,
who had avowed his authority to be my
conductor, but was prevented from execut|ing
his commi&s;&s;ion by a &s;udden violent
gale, which had impre&s;&s;ed his mind with
apprehen&s;ion of danger; therefore, con|ceiving
the ma&s;ter fully ju&s;tified in pro|ceeding
on the permi&s;&s;ion already granted,
I reque&s;ted the &s;entiments of tho&s;e gen|tlemen
with re&s;pect to the conduct nece&s;|&s;ary
to be adopted for his entire &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="428">
I was heard with the mo&s;t obliging
attention, and it appeared to be their unani|mous
opinion, that I had complied with
every requi&s;ite; that I was not actuated by
any ho&s;tile intentions again&s;t America; that
I had an undoubted right to avail my&s;elf
of the mo&s;t immediate opportunity to ob|tain
a pa&s;&s;age to Europe; and that the
ma&s;ter of the &s;chooner, who had been
publicly engaged to convey me on board a
Briti&s;h &s;hip, could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ubjected
to any cen&s;ure by the civil authority in
Virginia; nor would he encounter any ha|zard
with regard to the detention of his
per&s;on and property, by the officers and
&s;eamen in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Though I was happy in hearing &s;enti|ments
&s;o perfectly agreeable to my wi&s;hes,
yet I experienced much agitation, le&s;t they
might not prove effectual where it was imme|diately
nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be attended to;
<PB N="381" REF="429">
and a con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed, beyond the
limited period, before I received intimation
that the party in que&s;tion had made enquiry
for me.</P>
<P>In an in&s;tant I determined to make this
tran&s;action a public concern, and to re|ceive
his determination in pre&s;ence of tho&s;e
who had &s;o kindly evinced a &s;olicitude
for my welfare: he was therefore reque&s;ted
to enter the room, and to deliver his opi|nion
without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>The undi&s;gui&s;ed conduct which I a&s;|&s;umed
on this very intere&s;ting occa&s;ion,
in&s;tantly operated in my favour. The
ma&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed his doubts in a le&s;s forcible
manner; and they were an&s;wered by per|&s;ons
totally unconnected with my views,
with whom he was well acquainted, and
who could not po&s;&s;ibly be governed by any
motives prejudicial to his welfare or repu|tation.
The event more than an&s;wered
<PB N="382" REF="430">
my expectations: the arguments adduced
on my behalf; the per&s;ons by whom they
were delivered; and the open manner in
which I had &s;ubmitted to inve&s;tigation,
carried conviction to his mind; he engaged
to receive me without any further applica|tion,
and promi&s;ed to be ready for me
by the earlie&s;t dawn.</P>
<P>It was late before I retired to my apart|ment,
and then without the lea&s;t propen|&s;ity
to partake of re&s;t: I threw my&s;elf on
the bed, and yielded to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive train of
gloomy apprehen&s;ions. Indeed my &s;itua|tion
was extremely intricate: early in the
evening I had &s;een two per&s;ons, whom I
knew to be re&s;idents in Annapolis; I had
endeavoured to avoid them, but perceiving
my&s;elf di&s;covered, I a&s;&s;umed an air of con|fidence,
acco&s;ted them with apparent com|po&s;ure,
and enquired after the welfare of
&s;everal, with whom I had been happily
<PB N="383" REF="431">
connected in better times. They knew I
had taken my departure for the We&s;t
Indies, and appeared inqui&s;itive concerning
the motives which had occa&s;ioned my con|tinuance
on the continent. In brief terms
I intimated the di&s;appointment we had en|countered,
and the nece&s;&s;ity of awaiting a
more favourable opportunity; that the
ve&s;&s;el was &s;till lying in York River, and
that I had been led into that neighbour|hood
on a vi&s;it of friend&s;hip and curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Though my detail appeared to gain cre|dit,
I had &s;ome rea&s;on to conceive, that
they entertained &s;u&s;picions of my real
de&s;ign, which they might con&s;equently
attempt to fru&s;trate, by immediate mea|&s;ures
to my di&s;advantage. However I had
&s;ufficient re&s;olution to invite them to my
quarters, and obtained a ready a&s;&s;urance
that they would &s;ee me early on the en|&s;uing
<PB N="384" REF="432">
day, to receive my commands for
Maryland.</P>
<P>This event was an additional motive to
urge di&s;patch; and it al&s;o pointed out the
method nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue, if I found the
ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el inflexible to my argu|ments:
I determined, in that ca&s;e, to re|ceive
my unwelcome vi&s;itors with an ap|pearance
of &s;atisfaction, and if they were
returning to Annapolis, by way of York
Town, even offer to accompany them to
that place, as to the proper &s;ituation where
I was awaiting an opportunity to proceed
for the ocean.</P>
<P>Having, after our &s;eparation, &s;ucceeded
in my plan of engaging an immediate con|veyance
to the neare&s;t Briti&s;h &s;hip, I well
knew that the attempt, without &s;ucce&s;s,
would expo&s;e me to dangers and difficul|ties
of the mo&s;t alarming nature. My new
found acquaintance might be more early in
<PB N="385" REF="433">
their enquiries, than was con&s;i&s;tent with
the plan I had adopted. On learning that
I had amu&s;ed them with a fallacious ac|count,
an alarm might be in&s;tantly given,
which might occa&s;ion a pur&s;uit; and a
contrary wind, or bad failing, might throw
me into the power of tho&s;e who would put
the mo&s;t unfavourable con&s;truction on my
conduct; and perhaps puni&s;h me with a
rigour by no means proportioned to the
nature of the &s;uppo&s;ed offence. The&s;e
painful ideas occupied my mind till the
appearance of day. I was to receive no|tice
when the proper period arrived for
embarkation; and I waited the &s;ummons,
with equal impatience and anxiety. My
baggage, which was contained in a &s;mall
portmanteau, had been on board the ve&s;&s;el
from the time I had engaged her for my
pa&s;&s;age; and two or three trifling articles
which I had retained on &s;hore, were
the whole of my incumbrance. About
<PB N="386" REF="434">
half pa&s;t four, a lad arrived, with intelli|gence
that all was ready for my reception.
I delivered my parcel to his care and ac|companied
him to the adjacent beach, under
no &s;mall agitation of mind, which it was
highly incumbent on me to conceal, by a
&s;teady appearance of confidence and &s;e|renity.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent I lay down my pen, but
&s;hall re&s;ume it by every convenient oppor|tunity.
Situated as I now am, I have full
time to be circum&s;tantial in my detail; an
indifferent per&s;on might accu&s;e me of pro|lixity,
but I am per&s;uaded you experience
a real concern in whatever relates to my
intere&s;t or happine&s;s. Farewel!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>On board the Emerald, <DATE>July 3d, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>THE &s;chooner, de&s;tined for my con|veyance,
was navigated by an elderly
man, and by a youth about fourteen years
of age. With a view to guard again&s;t
accidents, and to animate my companions
to per&s;everance, I had laid in a &s;upply of
refre&s;hments for a voyage much longer
than ours promi&s;ed to be, and we quitted
the harbour with a favourable breeze, and
the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of an expeditious
pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We had not proceeded far on our cour&s;e,
before our attention was divided by the
&s;ight of two Briti&s;h frigates. One was
&s;tationed in the vicinity of the capes; and
<PB N="388" REF="436">
the other at &s;ome di&s;tance up the bay, in a
&s;ituation to ob&s;erve the movements in York
River. The former ve&s;&s;el being nearer to
the &s;ea, appeared mo&s;t eligible for my de|&s;ign,
and to that we directed our cour&s;e ac|cordingly:
but &s;carce had we dige&s;ted our
plan, when the wind &s;uddenly &s;ub&s;ided,
and a total calm &s;ucceeded, during the con|tinuance
of which we were unable to make
the lea&s;t progre&s;s: about noon, a &s;trong
breeze &s;et in directly oppo&s;ite to our
wi&s;hes; we made many tacks, without
&s;eeming to obtain the lea&s;t advantage; and
though, under this di&s;appointment, I &s;uf|fered
extreme agitation, yet had I re&s;olu|tion
to affect a perfect &s;erenity, that I might
not increa&s;e &s;u&s;picions in the mind of my
conductor, who could not avoid occa&s;ionally
intimating his apprehen&s;ions, that he en|countered
a con&s;iderable hazard in the un|dertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="437">
It is impo&s;&s;ible to paint the di&s;tre&s;s
that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, when
the impracticability of reaching the &s;hip,
at lea&s;t that evening, was announced in the
mo&s;t decided terms. A &s;trong head-&s;ea
operated equally with the wind to baffle
our be&s;t attempts; the ma&s;ter, therefore,
propo&s;ed to return into the harbour, and
patiently await the event of the &s;ucceeding
day. To this mea&s;ure I &s;trongly objected,
and recommended altering our cour&s;e for
the other ve&s;&s;el, which I conceived we
could ea&s;ily attain before the approach of
night; but was exceedingly mortified to
hear him explicitly di&s;&s;ent from my opi|nion;
when no choice was left me but to
return to an anchor, in order to take the
advantage of a more favourable opportu|nity.</P>
<P>This determination, &s;o cruelly adver&s;e
to my hopes, rendered me almo&s;t frantic
<PB N="390" REF="438">
with apprehen&s;ion. I recollected my An|napolitan
acquaintance, and the probability
that they had excited an alarm, on account
of the deception I had practi&s;ed, from un|avoidable
nece&s;&s;ity. I had al&s;o rea&s;on to
entertain ideas of dangers and difficulties
from every other quarter, and I knew not
how to &s;tem the torrent of adver&s;ity which
appeared ready to overwhelm me. We
were now before the wind, &s;tanding directly
for the harbour, to which we were advancing
with a very rapid progre&s;s: one expedient
only remained, which a &s;udden thought
&s;ugge&s;ted: I had plied my old pilot as
freely with the bottle, as was not in|con&s;i&s;tent
with our &s;afety; and he evi|dently
di&s;covered, in con&s;equence of it,
a greater pliability of di&s;po&s;ition. I availed
my&s;elf of the important cri&s;is, and under
the plau&s;ible pretext of &s;aving time, and
being more ready to catch the fir&s;t breath
of a propitious breeze, I propo&s;ed running
<PB N="391" REF="439">
under a cliff to leeward of the town, where
the riding was perfectly convenient; and
where I tru&s;ted we might remain undi&s;co|vered,
till we could again, with propriety,
re&s;ume our arduous undertaking.</P>
<P>To my infinite &s;atisfaction, and, indeed,
equal &s;urpri&s;e, my plan received his im|mediate,
and entire approbation: we were
quickly at an anchor behind a point of
land, which entirely &s;heltered us from the
view of the adjacent harbour; our little
ve&s;&s;el was &s;oon properly &s;ecured; the day
clo&s;ed with perfect &s;erenity; and the vete|ran
&s;eaman and his boy, after partaking of
&s;uch cheer as our &s;tock afforded, calmly
re&s;igned them&s;elves to repo&s;e, without an
anxious idea re&s;pecting the operations of
the en&s;uing day.</P>
<P>Contra&s;ted with mine, their &s;ituation
was indeed mo&s;t enviable&mdash;agitated by con|flicting
pa&s;&s;ions! by a continued &s;eries of
<PB N="392" REF="440">
di&s;appointments, I tamely yielded to the
pre&s;&s;ure of calamity! and even dreaded the
return of day, which was to expo&s;e me to
new trials, and probably to additional mor|tifications:
I weakly anticipated a train of
impending evils, which I con&s;idered as un|avoidable.</P>
<P>The night was uncommonly &s;plendid.
The beams of the ri&s;ing moon were beau|tifully
reflected on the noble expan&s;e of
water. Nature appeared perfectly &s;erene;
and every &s;urrounding object contributed
to elevate the imagination above terre&s;trial
objects; to infu&s;e a calm indifference
with regard to &s;ublunary events; and to
&s;ugge&s;t a firm confidence, in the great,
beneficent Creator! Yet, harra&s;&s;ed by the
corroding reflections which ince&s;&s;antly in|truded,
I became in&s;en&s;ible to all that
could dignify the mind; the delightful
pro&s;pect became a dreary wa&s;te; and I no
<PB N="393" REF="441">
longer recollected the providential delive|rances
I had &s;o frequently, and &s;o unex|pectedly
experienced.</P>
<P>I attempted, but in vain, to compo&s;e
my&s;elf, and to obtain that re&s;t &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial
to recruit my agitated &s;pirits, for
the tran&s;actions of the approaching morn|ing:
but every effort was ineffectual,
I therefore determined to occupy the te|dious
interval by an excur&s;ion on the adja|cent
&s;hore. Our ve&s;&s;el lay almo&s;t clo&s;e to
the beach, and a &s;mall canoe, which was
fa&s;tened to our &s;tern, enabled me, in an in|&s;tant,
to gratify my inclination. My com|rades,
exempt from every anxiety, were
in perfect enjoyment of the mo&s;t &s;ound
repo&s;e; and I landed, without their being
&s;en&s;ible of the intention I had formed.
By this time, the moon had nearly at|tained
her meridian height; the hemi|&s;phere
was decorated with unnumbered
<PB N="394" REF="442">
&s;tars, and not an intervening cloud ap|peared,
to ob&s;truct the view. I had at|tained
a con&s;iderable eminence, at no re|mote
di&s;tance from the place of our an|chorage;
and from that &s;ituation, I could
plainly di&s;tingui&s;h the town of Hampton;
&s;everal ve&s;&s;els lying at the mouth of the
harbour; an unlimited pro&s;pect of the
Che&s;apeak; and, ju&s;t ri&s;ing above the ho|ri&s;on,
the Briti&s;h frigate, the object of my
mo&s;t ardent hopes! Such a grand a&s;&s;em|blage
of intere&s;ting objects gradually di&s;|&s;ipated
the gloom which hung over me;
a returning ray of confidence took full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul; the eventful cir|cum&s;tances
of my preceding days, pa&s;&s;ed
rapidly in review before my imagination;
I yielded to an in&s;tantaneous impul&s;e I
found my&s;elf unable to re&s;i&s;t, and pro&s;|trate
on the &s;hore, acknowledged the
imb$cility of human nature, and implored
<PB N="395" REF="443">
the all-merciful Providence to &s;upport me,
under every future vici&s;&s;itude, and direct
my wandering &s;teps to the paths of peace
and &s;afety.</P>
<P>Supported and elevated by hope, I de|&s;cended,
like a new being, to the adjacent
beach, and ha&s;tened along the &s;hore to pre|pare
for the en&s;uing enterprize. Scarce
had I reached the ve&s;&s;el, before the wel|come
dawn, and a ri&s;ing favourable breeze,
intimated the expediency of commencing
our operations. I awakened my compa|nions,
and apprized them of the promi&s;ing
gale:&mdash;in an in&s;tant we were under way,
and &s;tood, with a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s,
for the frigate, which, during the
preceding day, had been the earne&s;t object
of our attention.</P>
<P>I now began to conceive, that fortune,
weary of per&s;ecuting me, was determined
<PB N="396" REF="444">
to make ample compen&s;ation for the mor|tification
and di&s;quietude I had &s;u&s;tained;
but I was de&s;tined to encounter yet fur|ther
trials, under circum&s;tances of more
imminent danger.</P>
<P>When we were within two leagues of
the &s;hip, and at the moment that I was
anticipating the happine&s;s which awaited
me, the breeze &s;uddenly headed us, and
quickly fre&s;hened to a perfect gale. Our
&s;chooner, unfortunately, was foul; her &s;ails
and rigging in bad condition; and we had,
in the cour&s;e of our former attempt, fully
experienced her inability to work to wind|ward.
In this dilemma, a con&s;ultation
took place, the re&s;ult of which was, a de|termination
to change our cour&s;e, for the
&s;hip which was &s;tationed up the bay; and
the ma&s;ter gave me great hopes that we
&s;hould carry our point, without much dif|ficulty,
if the wind continued &s;teady in its
<PB N="397" REF="445">
pre&s;ent quarter. To animate his exer|tions,
and attach him more &s;trongly to my
intere&s;t, I promi&s;ed a hand&s;ome augmenta|tion
to our &s;tipulated agreement; and in
return, he a&s;&s;ured me, that he would per|&s;evere
to the utmo&s;t, and at all events not
&s;helter in any harbour, unle&s;s ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity
enforced him.</P>
<P>We had &s;till &s;erious embarra&s;&s;ments to
encounter. A heavy cro&s;s &s;ea greatly im|peded
our progre&s;s, and frequently broke
over the deck in an alarming manner.
The wind al&s;o became &s;cant, and we barely
lay our cour&s;e. Hope, however, was pre|dominant;
I found we gradually gained on
our object; my comrades appeared con|fident
of &s;ucce&s;s; and I had a firm per|&s;ua&s;ion
that our expectations would be ef|fectually
gratified. Thus circum&s;tanced,
I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to obtain a &s;hort
repo&s;e; the agitation of my mind, and the
<PB N="398" REF="446">
extreme fatigue I had experienced, had
totally exhau&s;ted nature; I therefore &s;um|moned
re&s;olution to retire to my birth,
having previou&s;ly given directions to be
awakened before our arrival at the &s;hip; or
if any unfore&s;een event &s;hould take place,
which might require my attention or a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was about ten in the forenoon, when
I threw my&s;elf on my pillow, and in a
few minutes every anxious idea was oblite|rated
by a profound &s;leep; but &s;carce an
hour had elap&s;ed before I was alarmed by
a &s;ummons upon deck, and in a tone which
in&s;tantly filled my mind with a dread of
impending evil. I &s;prung in&s;tantly from
my cot, and in a moment was too perfectly
convinced, that I had the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons
to apprehend the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences.
We plainly de&s;cried an armed
&s;chooner, &s;tretching from the land, with
<PB N="399" REF="447">
an evident intention to intercept our pa&s;|&s;age
to the &s;hip, from which we were at
that time, about two miles di&s;tant; and
as &s;he gained rapidly upon us, I began to
abandon that confidence which had &s;o re|cently
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the depre&s;&s;ion which
almo&s;t overpowered my faculties, I a&s;&s;umed
&s;ufficient re&s;olution to animate my com|panions,
which I &s;econded, by promi&s;es of
greater efficacy, than the force of the mo&s;t
eloquent per&s;ua&s;ions; and the wind veering
a point or two in our favour, to my inex|pre&s;&s;ible
joy, we were within hail of the
&s;hip, when the American ve&s;&s;el was al&s;o
within random &s;hot, where &s;he lay to, in
order to watch our motions, and take her
mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>
<P>At this critical period it blew a fre&s;h of
wind, accompanied with a heavy &s;well of
the &s;ea; notwith&s;tanding which, we run
<PB N="400" REF="448">
along-&s;ide the frigate with tolerable dexte|rity;
but in attempting to catch a rope,
which was flung from the deck, the boy
had nearly fallen overboard, and before
another could be thrown for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
we had, in &s;pite of every effort, fallen to
leeward with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity. On a
&s;u&s;picion that we had acted by de&s;ign, an
officer directed us immediately to bring to,
in a manner &s;o commanding that we appre|hended
a &s;hot would be immediately fired
to force compliance. Obedience was
only left us; but under our circum|&s;tances,
obedience was attended with in|finite
danger; our anchor, though &s;uffi|cient
in &s;mooth water, was by no means
adapted for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, nor was
the cable in a condition to bear the violent
motion and working of the ve&s;&s;el; in &s;eve|ral
places it was greatly defective, and in
its be&s;t &s;tate, was only intended for har|bours,
and occa&s;ional mooring places along
<PB N="401" REF="449">
the &s;hore: nece&s;&s;ity enforced &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion;
the anchor was let go, and for &s;ome mo|ments
I indulged hope, that a boat would
be manned, and &s;ent from the &s;hip, to
learn the motives which had brought us
into that perilous &s;iuation; but in that
hope, &s;o rea&s;onably founded, I had quickly
the mortification to experience a di&s;appoint|ment,
we being again hailed, in an autho|ritative
manner, and directed to &s;end on
board immediately.</P>
<P>Situated as we were, it was in vain to
attempt repre&s;enting the particulars which
gave me a right to expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance and
protection: we were unfortunately unpro|vided
with a &s;peaking trumpet, and the
wind &s;etting directly again&s;t us, it was im|po&s;&s;ible
for the voice alone, at the di&s;|tance
we were from each other, to con|vey
an articulate &s;ound. Our canoe was of
the &s;malle&s;t dimen&s;ions, and could not,
<PB N="402" REF="450">
even in the mo&s;t &s;erene weather, contain
more than one per&s;on, with any degree of
&s;afety; tempe&s;tuous as it then was, the
mo&s;t imminent danger awaited the attempt;
to deliberate was, at lea&s;t, encountering
equal hazard: &s;hould the ve&s;&s;el drift, it
might be thought intentional, and a &s;hot
might be attended with fatal effects. I
therefore entreated the ma&s;ter to undertake
alone, without a moment's delay, the ar|duous
enterpri&s;e, while I continued with
his &s;ervant, to render him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance
in my power.</P>
<P>Who&s;e &s;ituation was mo&s;t critical, I am
utterly unable to determine: &s;carcely had
the canoe put off, before we became &s;en|&s;ible
that our ve&s;&s;el dragged upon the an|chor,
which induced my young a&s;&s;ociate to
expre&s;s the &s;tronge&s;t fears, that our cable
could not po&s;&s;ibly long hold out; in which
ca&s;e, the lea&s;t evil which threatened me
<PB N="403" REF="451">
was a tedious, and probably a rigid impri|&s;onment,
as the armed &s;chooner continued
lying-to, at no remote di&s;tance, and in a
very &s;hort time we mu&s;t have drifted &s;o
far to leeward, that &s;he would have taken
us, even within random &s;hot of that ve&s;&s;el
to which I fled for refuge.</P>
<P>Under circum&s;tances &s;o peculiarly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing,
I anxiou&s;ly attended to the mo|tions
of the canoe. The veteran &s;ea|man
acquitted him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t
dexterity. Sometimes, from the height of
the &s;ea, he was totally lo&s;t to view, which
excited a momentary &s;en&s;ation of the mo&s;t
painful nature; but when I &s;aw him ri&s;e
with a ri&s;ing wave, hope in con&s;equence
exhilarated my &s;pirits. Though the di&s;|tance
was not far, near an hour elap&s;ed, be|fore
I beheld him a&s;cending the &s;ide of the
&s;hip, every minute of which time, in my
peculiar &s;ituation, appeared in&s;upportably
<PB N="404" REF="452">
tedious. Meanwhile our little bark con|tinued
to pitch with great violence, and I
was under continual apprehen&s;ions, that
the &s;trands of our weak cable mu&s;t, in|evitably,
yield to &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive motion.
Gue&s;s then my tran&s;port, when I heard
the welcome &s;ignal given for hoi&s;ting out
a boat. My eyes were rivetted on an ob|ject
which promi&s;ed a &s;peedy and effectual
relief. I &s;aw her launch from the &s;hip,
with all the wild enthu&s;ia&s;m of joy! and
in a few minutes I had the inexpre&s;&s;ible
happine&s;s to take an officer by the hand,
who delivered a friendly me&s;&s;age from his
commander, with an obliging invitation to
partake of every accommodation his &s;itua|tion
could afford.</P>
<P>Thus much &s;hall &s;uffice for the employ|ment
of the pre&s;ent day; but I &s;hall quick|ly
re&s;ume the pen, that I may conclude a

con&s;ider intere&s;ting and eventful.</P>

<P>Emerald, <DATE>July 5, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>THE officer who had it in charge to
convey me on board his Maje&s;ty's
&s;hip, acquainted me that &s;he was named
the Thames, and was commanded by Cap|tain
Tyringham Howe, who had &s;o re|markably
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the de|fence
of the Gla&s;gow, when &s;he engaged
the American fleet, under the direction of
Commodore Hopkins.</P>
<P>Again&s;t a force &s;o wonderfully &s;uperior,
he maintained an animated conte&s;t; and,
in &s;pite of their utmo&s;t exertions, effected
<PB N="406" REF="454">
a gallant retreat into the harbour at Rhode
I&s;land. For his &s;teady and intrepid con|duct,
he was rewarded by a promotion into
his pre&s;ent &s;hip, which, I tru&s;t, will be
only a prelude to &s;ome more honourable
di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>By Captain Howe I was received with
a cordiality which exceeded my utmo&s;t ex|pectations.
I gave him a brief detail of
the events which had &s;o happily terminated
in placing me under his generous protec|tion;
and I entreated that he would ren|der
every a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the ma&s;ter of the
&s;chooner, by who&s;e zealous and determined
efforts I had accompli&s;hed an e&s;cape, which
opened the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy re&s;toration
to the ble&s;&s;ings of dome&s;tic &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of my requi&s;ition, im|mediate
orders were given to &s;ecure his ve&s;|&s;el
beneath the &s;tern of the frigate; and
<PB N="407" REF="455">
my old pilot, with his faithful adherent,
was received on board with a&s;&s;urances of
every accommodation, until a favourable
opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf of pro&s;ecuting
their intentions with entire &s;afety.</P>
<P>In about an hour after my arrival I &s;at
down with Captain H&mdash;, and &s;everal
officers, to a plain but plentiful dinner; I
experienced &s;en&s;ations I had long been un|accu&s;tomed
to&mdash;my mind was exhilarated
with joy and gratitude&mdash;I acknowledged
the intervention of an all-directing Provi|dence&mdash;and
I enjoyed a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
the&s;e delightful ideas, which indicated a
rever&s;e of fortune, and an ample compen|&s;ation
for pa&s;t &s;olicitudes.</P>
<P>On my name being occa&s;ionally menti|oned,
it caught the attention of the fir&s;t
lieutenant, who, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment,
di&s;covered a knowledge of my former &s;itu|ation.
He particularly enquired concern|ing
<PB N="408" REF="456">
the welfare of my deare&s;t wife and &s;on,
and a&s;&s;ured me, with uncommon warmth,
that every gentleman belonging to that
&s;hip had, even previous to the hope of any
per&s;onal acquaintance, conceived &s;entiments
highly advantageous to my character and
my principles. Perceiving every counte|nance
bore convincing te&s;timony to the
truth of &s;uch plea&s;ing a&s;&s;ertions, I was
lo&s;t in amazement; and could not pene|trate
into the my&s;tery which had &s;o &s;trange|ly
&s;ecured to me the approbation and e&s;|teem
of per&s;ons to whom I conceived I was
totally unknown. I therefore entreated an
immediate explanation, that I might learn
how to render my grateful acknowledg|ments,
and to approve my&s;elf de&s;erving
&s;uch an unexpected prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my
behalf.</P>
<P>Mr. R&mdash;, the gentleman who had &s;o
kindly expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in my favour,
<PB N="409" REF="457">
then acquainted me that &startq;a few weeks
&s;ince, the Thames had taken an Ame|rican
ve&s;&s;el bound to a French i&s;land, on
board of which were a number of let|ters,
which had been examined, with a
view to obtain information; that in per|forming
this duty they had met with
two under my &s;ignature, which had im|pre&s;&s;ed
them &s;o &s;trongly in my behalf,
that it was re&s;olved to retain them till
an opportunity offered for their &s;afe con|veyance.
Accordingly on the arrival of
the &s;hip at New York, they had been
intru&s;ted to the care of a German offi|cer,
with particular injunctions to de|liver
them immediately on the comple|tion
of his voyage<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. R&mdash;inclo&s;ed the intercepted letters, in a very elegant and expre&s;&s;ive epi&s;tle from him&s;elf; and they were punctually delivered. The author is, at this time, happy in including Captain R&mdash;among&s;t his be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable friends.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;Mr. R&mdash;
concluded by ob&s;erving that, &startq;the in&s;tant
<PB N="410" REF="458">
my name was mentioned,&endq; he entertained &s;an|guine
hopes that I was the per&s;on in who&s;e
cau&s;e they had been &s;o &s;trongly intere&s;ted;
and on finding tho&s;e hopes &s;o agreeably
confirmed, he was per&s;uaded every gentle|man
on board that &s;hip rejoiced in the un|expected
opportunity of affording protec|tion
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, where attachment ope|rated
&s;o forcibly with duty to command
their be&s;t exertions.</P>
<P>Had I not in&s;tantly conceived &s;enti|ments
of regard for this worthy man, I
mu&s;t have been in&s;en&s;ible to every gene|rous,
every grateful impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I beheld
him with a mixture of reverence and love
&mdash;and tears&mdash;heart-felt tears&mdash;proclaimed
the genuine, the &s;ervent acknowledgments
of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>On board the Thames I continued until
the 27th, experiencing from Captain H&mdash;
and the gentlemen under his command,
<PB N="411" REF="459">
the mo&s;t obliging attention and ho&s;pitality.
But that &s;hip being &s;tationed a con&s;ider|able
di&s;tance up the bay, I became anxious
for a removal into the Emerald, which lay
in the vicinity of the capes, who&s;e comman|der
con&s;equently had it more in his power
to forward the intentions of tho&s;e who&s;e
circum&s;tances rendered it expedient to vi&s;it
the city of New York.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the above day, an officer
in an armed ve&s;&s;el having arrived on &s;ome
duty from the commodore, I determined
to embrace the opportunity of his return,
that I might obtain a &s;ituation nearer to
the object of my hopes.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty I obtained the con|&s;ent
of Captain H&mdash;, and his benevo|lent
officers, to this nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure.
They &s;ugge&s;ted the probability of being
&s;peedily relieved, and the plea&s;ure they
&s;hould receive in conveying me to my de|&s;ired
<PB N="412" REF="460">
haven. Though I felt the full force
of &s;uch per&s;ua&s;ions, yet I combated their
friendly arguments with rea&s;ons &s;o ju&s;tly
founded, that my ho&s;pitable protectors
yielded reluctantly to their force; and with
their &s;incere prayers for the completion of
all my pur&s;uits, I bade them farewell; and
early on the following day, was received
on board the Emerald with great attention
and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>I have now brought you to my pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, where I experience every proof
of regard and humanity. Since the com|mencement
of this conte&s;t, I have repeat|edly
heard it a&s;&s;erted, that the commanders
of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips con&s;ider protection
rather as an act of nece&s;&s;ity than inclina|tion;
and that tho&s;e loyali&s;ts who had,
with infinite hazard, effected an e&s;cape
from the adver&s;e party, had been treated
by them, on application for refuge, with
<PB N="413" REF="461">
a di&s;tance and haughtine&s;s, that aggravated
their &s;ufferings, and almo&s;t alienated their
&s;entiments of allegiance. I verily believe
the a&s;&s;ertion, in every in&s;tance, mo&s;t un|ju&s;tly
founded; propagated by malice, and
by republican artifice. On board the Eme|rald
are &s;everal gentlemen under &s;imilar
circum&s;tances with my&s;elf; all equally
&s;trangers to our benefactors, we are all
equally treated as friends and brethren.
Captain Caldwell, who is the commodore
on the &s;tation, is continually gaining on
our e&s;teem by the affability of his manners;
his officers appear no le&s;s anxious to pro|mote
our entire &s;atisfaction; and we meet
with every accommodation our &s;ituation
can po&s;&s;ibly obtain. But kindly and hu|manely
treated as I am, happine&s;s is not
yet my portion; my thoughts are anxiou&s;ly
turned towards you and our deare&s;t boy,
and I con&s;ider every hour a tedious delay,
till I obtain information of your health and
<PB N="414" REF="462">
welfare. Your letters will probably deter|mine
my future conduct. I tru&s;t I &s;hall
&s;oon rejoin you in England; or by a plea&s;|ing
change in the political &s;y&s;tem, be en|abled
once more to bid you welcome to
the continent of America. May hea|ven
grant us a &s;peedy re-union; and may
we pa&s;s the re&s;idue of our days, without
again experiencing the in&s;upportable anxi|ety
of &s;eparation.</P>
<P>New York, <DATE>July 19, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>I have only a few minutes to inform
you, that ye&s;terday I was &s;afely landed in

reception from our invaluable friends.</P>
<P>I found but one letter from my deare&s;t
wife, dated on the 26th of April, and 1&s;t

your welfare, my joy was inexpre&s;&s;ible.
More than &s;ixteen tedious months had
<PB N="415" REF="463">
elap&s;ed, &s;ince the date of your la&s;t: many
of your epi&s;tles have undoubtedly mi&s;car|ried:
mine to you, I tru&s;t, have been
more fortunate. During the remainder of
our &s;eparation, our corre&s;pondence will be
certain. I am now free, unawed, unre|&s;trained.&mdash;I
feel my&s;elf enlarged; and I
will write, &s;peak, and act, as becomes a
zealous adherent to the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>In my next I will give you the particu|lars
of my expedition hither; of my pre|&s;ent
&s;ituation; and probably &s;ome idea of
my future intentions; but as the &s;hip
which is to convey this is preparing to &s;ail,
I mu&s;t po&s;tpone further information.</P>
<P>Opportunities of writing from this place
very frequently offer: expect therefore to
hear from me again &s;peedily. My volu|minous

<P>MY la&s;t contained a circum&s;tantial de|tail
from the day of my quitting
Maryland, to that of my reception on
board the Emerald frigate. I &s;hall now
continue my narrative to the time of my
arrival in this city.</P>
<P>On the tenth of July, at day break, &s;e|veral
ve&s;&s;els were di&s;tingui&s;hed, which had
pa&s;&s;ed us by favour of the night, and
were &s;tretching to the ea&s;tward with a
croud of canvas. In an in&s;tant we weigh|ed
anchor, and &s;tood out to &s;ea. The Se|negal
<PB N="417" REF="465">
&s;loop of war, and an armed brig,
that were &s;tationed off Cape Charles, join|ed
us in the chace; and before noon we
took three large &s;loops and two &s;chooners
laden with tobacco, flour, and various va|luable
commodities for the French i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The capture of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els was a for|tunate
event to me, and to tho&s;e who were
under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, it being de|termined
to &s;end the prizes immediately to
New York, under convoy of the Senegal,
commanded by Captain Molloy.</P>
<P>On Friday the eleventh, Captain C&mdash;
introduced two gentlemen, who had e&s;|caped
from Virginia, and my&s;elf, to the
commander of the Senegal, and recom|mended
us &s;trongly to his kind attention.
On board this &s;hip we experienced every
proof of ho&s;pitality and regard during the
pa&s;&s;age to New York, where, on the 18th,
we were &s;afely landed.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="466">
On entering the Narrows, my mind was
forcibly &s;truck with the &s;plendid appear|ance
of a numerous, and formidable equip|ment.
A grand fleet, attended with in|numerable
tran&s;ports, arranged in their
&s;everal divi&s;ions, lay at anchor off Sta|ten
I&s;land. The i&s;land it&s;elf was co|vered
with troops ready for embarcation,
and every appearance indicated an expe|dition
of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive con&s;equence.
I could not avoid contemplating, with a&s;|toni&s;hment,
the power&mdash;the apparently ir|re&s;i&s;table
power&mdash;of the parent &s;tate; and,
in con&s;equence, equal a&s;toni&s;hment took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind, when I reflected
how ineffectual, to every &s;alutary purpo&s;e,
the mo&s;t determined efforts had hitherto
been.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. C&mdash;in&s;i&s;t on my &s;o|journing
beneath their friendly roof, until
&s;ome plan is adopted for a permanent &s;itu|ation;
<PB N="419" REF="467">
and expre&s;s their regret, that un|avoidable
events have &s;o long detained me
from experiencing their humanity and af|fection.</P>
<P>Mr. C&mdash;is no longer Commi&s;&s;ary Ge|neral,
having re&s;igned that lucrative office
with the greate&s;t credit to his abilities and
reputation; and is now Auditor General
of accompts, a &s;tation of equal honour,
but inferior in point of emolument: it is,
however, attended with much le&s;s fatigue.</P>
<P>This alteration, though de&s;irable to him,
is particularly unfavourable to me. His
patronage as Commi&s;&s;ary General was very
exten&s;ive; and his inclination corre&s;ponded
with his power to render me e&s;&s;ential &s;er|vice.
He has ju&s;t acquainted me that he
had, with a view to my intere&s;t, deferred
for &s;ome time the filling up a profitable
appointment; but learning that I had
taken my pa&s;&s;age by way of the We&s;t In|dies,
<PB N="420" REF="468">
he had given up all hopes of &s;eeing
me in New York; and had, therefore,
previous to his re&s;ignation, di&s;po&s;ed of the
employment to a gentleman who will, in
all probability, acquire thereby an ample
provi&s;ion, &s;hould the war be continued for
any length of time.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that di&s;appointment is
&s;till to de&s;troy our hopes of pro&s;perity.
But it is folly&mdash;nay, it is criminal to in|dulge
an idea of di&s;content. We have &s;uf|ficient
motives to nouri&s;h the mo&s;t grate|ful
acknowledgments: we will, therefore,
look forward with increa&s;ing confidence,
and tru&s;t to heaven alone for the di&s;po&s;al
of every future concern.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a more mag|nificent
appearance than was exhibited
by the departure of the grand fleet,
which on the 23d of la&s;t month, weighed
anchor, and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward with a
<PB N="421" REF="469">
favourable breeze. Whither they are bound
is to the public an impenetrable &s;ecret;
but if the con&s;equences are what might
be expected from the apparent &s;trength of
the armament, &s;urely the day is at hand
which will happily terminate the compli|cated
mi&s;eries of this unnatural war.</P>
<P>There are tho&s;e who appear &s;anguine
enough to believe, that the pre&s;ent campaign
will a&s;&s;uredly prove deci&s;ive, and re&s;tore the
ancient government. It is certain that
much may be expected from the operations
of the formidable force under the com|mand
of Lord and General Howe; and
the utmo&s;t anxiety and impatience prevail
for intelligence of their de&s;tination and
proceedings.</P>
<P>Our worthy friend has a delightful &s;itu|ation
on the banks of the Ea&s;t River,
about five miles di&s;tant from New York,
where he principally re&s;ides during the

and to render our retirement truly delec|table.</P>
<P>In the vicinity of our habitation, is a
very dangerous and narrow pa&s;&s;age of the
river, the &s;ight of which excites ideas of
greater terror than the celebrated poetical
de&s;criptions of Scylla and Charybdis. The
tide runs with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, and in
various currents, only one of which will
carry a ve&s;&s;el through, with any degree of
&s;afety; for on one &s;ide there is a &s;hoal of
rocks that barely make their appearance
above the water; and on the other, a dread|ful
vortex, occa&s;ioned by a rock &s;everal feet
<PB N="424" REF="472">
beneath the &s;urface, which attracts and
engulphs every object that approaches it.
At particular periods of the tide, this tre|mendous
whirlpool appears to boil like
foaming cauldrons, accompanied with a
hollow terrific &s;ound, which impre&s;&s;es the
mo&s;t determined mind with apprehen&s;ions
of inevitable de&s;truction. The breadth of
the river at this place is nearly half a mile,
but that of the channel does not exceed
eighty yards. This pa&s;&s;age is only prac|ticable
at, and near the height of tide; at
any other time it would be extreme ra&s;h|ne&s;s
to attempt it; and under the mo&s;t fa|vourable
circum&s;tances, the greate&s;t know|ledge
and dexterity are requi&s;ite in the na|vigation.</P>
<P>Attended by &s;ome &s;kilful boatmen, I
had the curio&s;ity to &s;hoot this formidable
gulf, which has, with &s;ome degree of pro|priety,
obtained the appellation of <HI>Hell-Gate.</HI>
<PB N="425" REF="473">
The velocity of our motion was,
indeed, beyond credibility, through a won|derfully
agitated &s;tream, accompanied with
&s;uch dreadful roarings that, confident as I
was in the &s;kill of my conductors, I heartily
repented the temerity of the undertaking,
and beheld, in imagination, the invi&s;ible
boundary &startq;from which no traveller re|turns.&endq;</P>
<P>York I&s;land extends to King&s;bridge,
about fourteen miles di&s;tant from the city;
where it is joined to the continent by a
&s;mall wooden bridge. The narrow deep
river, which runs at this place, is a &s;uf|ficient
&s;ecurity again&s;t &s;udden incur&s;ions;
and the works that are thrown up are &s;o
exceedingly &s;trong, and in &s;uch command|ing
&s;ituations, as effectually to exclude the
idea of a regular attack.</P>
<P>The capital of this province is &s;ituated
on the &s;outhern extremity of the i&s;land:
<PB N="426" REF="474">
on one &s;ide runs the north, and on the other
the ea&s;t river; on the latter of which, on
account of the harbour, the city is princi|pally
built. In &s;everal &s;treets, trees are
regularly planted, which afford a grateful
&s;helter during the inten&s;e heat of the &s;um|mer.
The buildings are generally of brick,
and many are erected in a &s;tile of elegance.
The &s;ituation is &s;aid to be perfectly health|ful,
but fre&s;h water is &s;o very &s;carce, that
the purcha&s;e of this e&s;&s;ential article is at|tended
with a con&s;iderable expen&s;e.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the war, New York
is plentifully &s;upplied from Long I&s;land
with provi&s;ions of all kinds. It mu&s;t,
however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that almo&s;t every
article bears an exorbitant price, when com|pared
with that of former happy times.
Both the north and ea&s;t rivers abound with
a great variety of excellent fi&s;h. Lob&s;ters,
of a prodigious &s;ize, were, till of late,
<PB N="427" REF="475">
caught in va&s;t numbers, but it is a fact,
&s;urpri&s;ing as it may appear, that, &s;ince the
late ince&s;&s;ant cannonading, they have en|tirely
for&s;aken the coa&s;t, not one having
been taken, or &s;een, &s;ince the commence|ment
of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>Into this place and neighbourhood, lob|&s;ters
were introduced by accident; the
province having been formerly &s;upplied
with them by the fi&s;hermen of New Eng|land,
who brought them in well-boats, one
of which, in pa&s;&s;ing Hell-Gate, &s;triking
again&s;t a rock, &s;eparated, and the lob&s;ters,
which e&s;caped into their proper element,
multiplied &s;o exceedingly, that in a &s;hort
time the markets were amply and rea&s;on|ably
&s;upplied.</P>
<P>Previous to the commencement of this un|happy
war, New York was a flouri&s;hing, po|pulous,
and beautiful town. But immedi|ately
on the Briti&s;h troops taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="428" REF="476">
it was &s;et on fire by &s;ome de&s;perate incen|diaries,
and near a third part de&s;troyed, in
&s;pite of the utmo&s;t exertions to prevent the
&s;preading conflagration. The flames, at
the &s;ame in&s;tant, bur&s;t out in a variety of
places, which rendered it evident, that this
execrable deed was perpetrated from a
principle of ill-directed zeal, in order to
preclude the royal army from a po&s;&s;ibility
of maintaining, with the lea&s;t degree of
comfort, their important acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the late deva&s;tation,
there are &s;till many elegant edifices remain|ing,
which would reflect credit on any me|tropolis
in Europe. The new church is a
noble &s;tructure: the college is &s;pacious
and convenient: the barracks are well
built, and well accommodated. The Dutch
churches, with &s;everal places of wor&s;hip
for Prote&s;tants of different per&s;ua&s;ions, re|flect
great credit on the genius of their ar|chitects;
<PB N="429" REF="477">
and the general &s;tile which pre|dominates
in this city, impre&s;&s;es the mind
with an idea of neatne&s;s and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The numerous fortifications thrown up
by the American troops in the vicinity of
the capital, appear to be con&s;tructed with
judgment and attention. Why they were
&s;o precipitately abandoned is difficult to
a&s;certain: indeed the whole i&s;land forms a
continued chain of batteries and intrench|ments,
which &s;eemed to indicate the mo&s;t
re&s;olute oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I have lately made an excur&s;ion to Long
I&s;land, and was highly entertained in my
progre&s;s through a rich, beautiful, and
well cultivated country. At a village named
Flatbu&s;h, I met with &s;everal provincial
officers belonging to the Maryland batta|lions,
who had been taken in different ac|tions,
and were pri&s;oners on parole; and
it was with real &s;atisfaction I recognized
<PB N="430" REF="478">
&s;ome of my old acquaintance, and an&s;wered
their re&s;pective interrogatories relative to
their friends and connexions in that pro|vince.</P>
<P>I have, in the cour&s;e of my excur&s;ions,
traver&s;ed the whole of York I&s;land, and
have even attended the relief of the piquet
guard without King&s;bridge, which is the
advanced po&s;t of the Briti&s;h army. It is
impo&s;&s;ible to convey an adequate idea of
the intere&s;ting and noble objects which, in
every direction, &s;trike the curious and in|qui&s;itive
eye. From the city of New
York, to the extent of the i&s;land, we be|held
a regular continuation of formidable
intrenchments. The troops appear animated
in the &s;ervice; and, &s;urely, if their opera|tions
are properly conducted, the event
cannot but effectually re-e&s;tabli&s;h our an|cient
happy con&s;titution on a permanent
foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="479">
I frequently partake of a military dinner,
and have been ho&s;pitably entertained by
the officers of different corps. As I have
no real employment to occupy my time, I
often change the &s;cene. Variety of objects
tends to prevent the intru&s;ion of painful
reflections; yet, in &s;pite of my be&s;t efforts,
I am almo&s;t unable to &s;tem the tide of &s;or|row,
when pa&s;t ble&s;&s;ings ri&s;e up, like phan|toms,
to my view, and irre&s;i&s;tably remind
me, &startq;that &s;uch things were, and that I
once was happy.&endq;</P>
<P>I have written by Mr. S&mdash;to Sir Ro|bert
Eden, and have tran&s;mitted him a
minute detail of the political &s;tate of Ma|ryland.
I have repre&s;ented leading cha|racters
with truth and impartiality; and
have endeavoured to convey a competent
idea of the military arrangements, and le|gi&s;lative
di&s;po&s;itions which have taken place
in con&s;equence of the new &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment.

He will, probably, give you
his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of my com|munications.

true light, &startq;nor &s;et down aught in malice.&endq;</P>

<P>I am &s;omewhat relieved from the anxi|ety
I have experienced. Several letters
mention the departure of a fleet for this
port, under convoy of the Bri&s;tol, which
left England previous to the &s;ailing of the
packet; con&s;equently they may be hourly
expected: by that opportunity I &s;hall, a&s;|&s;uredly,
receive intimation of your health
and welfare.</P>
<P>We have certain advice, thar our for|midable
armament has proceeded up the
Che&s;apeak, and that the troops are landed,
in high &s;pirits, near the head of Elk. My
friend Captain H&mdash;, who has been here
<PB N="433" REF="481">
&s;ome time, expects &s;ailing orders every mi|nute,
and &s;olicits me to accompany him
on the cruize. Should he be directed to
Maryland, I have re&s;olved to attend him;
for if we obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that province,
my duty and my intere&s;t will, undoubted|ly,
require my immediate pre&s;ence. But
to &s;ay truth, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly adopt any
plan, with the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction, until I
procure information how it is with you,
and our deare&s;t boy.</P>
<P><DATE>6th September,</DATE></P>
<P>It is confidently reported, that the city
of Annapolis, the &s;cene of our former hap|pine&s;s
and pro&s;perity, is, by the inevitable
calamity of war, reduced to a&s;hes. I need
not ob&s;erve, that very many, whom we
have cau&s;e to love and e&s;teem, will mo&s;t
materially &s;uffer in con&s;equence of this un|fortunate
event. I am extremely anxious
<PB N="434" REF="482">
to learn the fate of our loyal friends who
were nece&s;&s;itated, by circum&s;tances, to re|main
in that place, and in the neighbour|hood.
I think it probable, that on the ap|pearance
of the Briti&s;h fleet, the adherents
to government were compelled to retire
to the interior country.</P>
<P>Captain H&mdash;has not yet learned his
de&s;tination, but &s;hould he proceed to the
Che&s;apeak, it is my fixed intention to ac|company
him; by which means I &s;hall
obtain the knowledge of many material
circum&s;tances, which it may be nece&s;&s;ary
to impart to our &s;uffering brethren in Eng|land.</P>
<P>The provincials have lately made an at|tack
on Staten I&s;land, where, during the
fir&s;t confu&s;ion, they burned &s;ome &s;tores,
and took a few pri&s;oners; but they have
paid &s;everely for the attempt. The alarm
in&s;tantly reached an adjacent po&s;t, and be|fore
<PB N="435" REF="483">
they could effect a retreat they were
vigorou&s;ly attacked. About two hundred
fell in the action, and near three hundred
&s;urrendered to the Briti&s;h detachment.
Another party landed about the &s;ame time
on Long I&s;land, but on the appearance of
oppo&s;ition, quitted it with precipitation.
A &s;trong body likewi&s;e advanced within
&s;ight of our lines at King&s;bridge, but re|tired
on the approach of our light infan|try.
From the&s;e movements there is rea|&s;on
to believe, that an attack was meditated
on New York, in the ab&s;ence of our grand
army; but, happily, a &s;ufficient force is
left to baffle the be&s;t concerted attempt.</P>
<P><DATE>13th September.</DATE></P>
<P>I have, impatiently, expected particulars
relative to Annapolis; but, as nothing fur|ther
is yet circulated, I am inclined to in|dulge
hope that the account which was
propagated is without foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="484">
Nothing of real importance has yet tran&s;|pired
from Lord Howe and the general;
which is rather extraordinary, as we have
had certain information of our troops hav|ing
effected a landing at the head of the
Che&s;apeak; and that they were in the vi|cinity
of the American army.</P>
<P>A report is circulated, that General
Burgoyne has totally defeated the northern
army, under the command of General
Gates. If true&mdash;the con&s;equences mu&s;t

<P>New York, <DATE>Sept. 20, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>WE have intelligence of the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting
and plea&s;ing nature. It
is &s;aid that General Wa&s;hington has &s;uf|fered
a total defeat in the neighbourhood
of Philadelphia. Should this report, which
is generally credited, be well founded, this
de&s;tructive war will &s;urely be quickly ter|minated.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform you, that the ac|count
re&s;pecting Annapolis was totally
without foundation. Hitherto Maryland
has not experienced the actual &s;courge of

There is certainly rea&s;on to credit this re|port,

<P>The Thames is &s;ailed for the Che&s;apeak.
I have been di&s;&s;uaded from accompanying
Captain H&mdash;and my friends on board
that &s;hip, by the earne&s;t advice of Mr. C&mdash;

others, by an excur&s;ion thither.&endq; But
another rea&s;on more forcibly operates to
detain me in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation&mdash;the

<P>On Saturday la&s;t arrived the packet.
Your letters, which informed me that
you were well and happy, relieved my
mind from a mo&s;t painful and tedious &s;tate
of di&s;quietude.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day an expedition took place
under the command of Sir Henry Clinton,
and commodore Hotham. Their de&s;tina|tion
was up the North River; and this in|&s;tant
we have received the particulars of
their operations. Fort Montgomery, and
Fort Clinton, have been taken by &s;torm;
and in the capture of the&s;e places, it was
doubtful whether bravery or humanity was
mo&s;t predominant.</P>
<P>Count Gabrou&s;ki, a young Poli&s;h no|bleman,
who arrived in the late fleet from
<PB N="440" REF="488">
England, &s;erved as a volunteer in this ex|pedition;
and in tho&s;e ranks, where every
individual di&s;played the utmo&s;t heroi&s;m,
his di&s;tingui&s;hed coolne&s;s and intrepidity,
attracted univer&s;al admiration. In ru&s;hing
forward to the enemy's works, again&s;t a
heavy and well directed fire, he received
many wounds, and fell at the foot of their
intrenchments. His death was not im|mediate;
&mdash;he lived to rejoice in victory!
The undaunted deportment of the Briti&s;h
grenadiers excited his applau&s;e, even in the
moment of di&s;&s;olution. He &s;poke with
rapture of that enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour which
animated the whole as one body; and he
de&s;ired that his remains might be depo|&s;ited
on the memorable &s;pot, where his
gallant a&s;&s;ociates had gained &s;uch honor.
It is &s;aid, he entreated Lord Rawdon, in
a very hand&s;ome compliment, to wear
that &s;word which he had &s;o recently drawn
in &s;upport of the claims of Britain; and
<PB N="441" REF="489">
then paid the inevitable debt, with that
intrepidity of &s;pirit which determined his
conduct, and led him forward to his fate.</P>
<P>It is expected the &s;ucce&s;s which has at|tended
this expedition, will greatly facili|tate
the operations of General Burgoyne,
who, after having &s;urmounted infinite dan|gers
and difficulties, has certainly advanced
into the neighbourhood of Albany.</P>
<P>Such variety of contradictory reports are
daily circulated relative to the real &s;ituation
of the army under his command, that at
pre&s;ent all is mere conjecture, without
any certain ground on which to erect hope,
or admit de&s;pondency. There are tho&s;e
who conceive, that General Howe ought
to have conducted his fir&s;t efforts, to
complete a junction with the northern ar|my;
and then to have directed the united
force of the Briti&s;h arms, wherever their
<PB N="442" REF="490">
exertions would have been mo&s;t effectual.
But without due information of tho&s;e im|portant
facts, that influence the proceed|ings
of our commanders, it is illiberal and
ungenerous, to cen&s;ure or condemn. The
be&s;t concerted plans are frequently defec|tive
in execution; and the &s;eeming hand
of chance often leads to &s;ucce&s;s the mo&s;t
brilliant and deci&s;ive.</P>

<P>At length <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;e</HI> is determined by <HI>cer|tainty.</HI>
I am preparing for my immediate

The unfavourable a&s;pect of public affairs
compels me to this nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure; and
I mu&s;t, in con&s;equence, encounter the in|conveniences
of a winter's pa&s;&s;age. But the
predominant idea of being &s;peedily re&s;tored
to the &s;ociety of a beloved wife and &s;on,
will &s;mooth the rugged billows, and di&s;|&s;ipate
<PB N="443" REF="491">
every apprehen&s;ion of difficulty or
danger.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne has been nece&s;&s;itated
to &s;urrender him&s;elf with his army. The
particulars of this unhappy, unexpected
event, are not yet public; but it is &s;trongly
a&s;&s;erted, that the want of provi&s;ions, and
not the amazing &s;uperiority of the enemy,
obliged our gallant general to &s;ubmit to
the inevitable fate of war.</P>
<P>An univer&s;al dejection has followed:
every loyal countenance bears the mo&s;t
evident impre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow and di&s;ap|pointment.
The exaltation of our adver|&s;aries
is doubtle&s;s in full proportion to
our mortification: for certainly this im|portant
&s;ucce&s;s will animate their efforts
in the pro&s;ecution of the war; give credit
and &s;trength to their political negotiations,
and render dubious the event of a conte&s;t,
<PB N="444" REF="492">
which appeared rapidly approaching to a
de&s;irable i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The duty which fell to the &s;hare of Ge|neral
Burgoyne, was infinitely more ha|zardous
than the allotment of our other
commanders; and, I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, it
is the prevailing opinion, that there has been
&s;ome neglect in the proper arrangements
nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ecured &s;ucce&s;s. But
leaving the&s;e matters which are too high
for me, and enter not within my limited
&s;phere of action, I &s;hall confine my ob&s;er|vations
to dome&s;tic concernments.</P>
<P>A fleet is expected to &s;ail from this place

before the conclu&s;ion of the year, I
tru&s;t we &s;hall be re-united. May we

<P>&startq;When ho&s;tilities unhappily commenced between the parent &s;tate and her mi&s;guided colonies, this great! this worthy man! then exerted him&s;elf in a more ex|alted &s;phere! The loyali&s;t, who abandoned his family and property, compelled by the rigid hand of per&s;ecution, and who preferred his integrity to every inducement of avarice or ambition, found in him a &s;ympathizing bene|factor, by whom he was ho&s;pitably received, his nece&s;&s;i|ties amply &s;upplied, and every relief extended that his fortune or influence could po&s;&s;ibly afford.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The pri&s;oner experienced no le&s;s the effects of his unlimited compa&s;&s;ion: among&s;t tho&s;e who were cap|tured by the incidents of war, many were the hu&s;bands, the &s;ons, and friends of them with whom he had been formerly connected. By his intere&s;t he procured them particular indulgences; he advanced con&s;iderable &s;ums for their immediate occa&s;ions, and exerted every effort to alleviate the idea of captivity, and render them com|fo$table in their peculiar &s;ituations. In a word, the ut|mo&s;t ho&s;pitality marked the whole of his conduct, and the innate goodne&s;s of his heart beamed forth in every action.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Such was the man for whom the prayers of multi|tudes were fervently offered; but, alas! the will of heaven &s;uddenly removed him from this terre&s;trial &s;tate, to receive an eternal recompen&s;e for his faithful di&s;|charge of every relative duty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To enter fully into the character of this very ex|cellent per&s;on, would greatly exceed my abilities, and lead me into a field of prolixity. Suffice it to &s;ay, that in him his &s;overeign has lo&s;t a mo&s;t loyal animated &s;ub|ject; his country an invaluable citizen; his wife a ten|der indulgent hu&s;band; and the writer of this letter (with numbers who have felt the mi&s;eries of this un|natural contention) has lo&s;t the mo&s;t faithful affectionate friend! the mo&s;t generous humane benefactor!&endq;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLI.</HEAD>
<P>$$rk, <DATE>Dec. 16&punc; 1777&punc;</DATE></P>
<P>THANKS to Almighty God I am
&s;afely arrived at my de&s;ired port,
after a plea&s;ant and expeditious pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>On the 15th of November I took an
affectionate leave of our generous ho&s;pi|table
friends; on the 18th we quitted the
coa&s;t; on the 13th in&s;tant we &s;truck &s;ound|ings;
and ye&s;terday, in the evening, land|ed
at a village named Pa&s;&s;age; took po&s;t
hor&s;es, and were &s;et down in this city in
time to procure a good &s;upper, and conve|nient
lodging.</P>
<P>The hurry and bu&s;tle of this place bears
&s;ome re&s;emblance to our great metropolis.
The &s;treets are crowded with bu&s;y multi|tudes;
many of the &s;hops have a hand|&s;ome
<PB N="451" REF="499">
appearance; and the habitations of
the principal merchants, &s;ufficiently indi|cate
their wealth and commercial import|ance.
The incredible quantities of provi|&s;ions,
which are preparing for exportation,
cannot but excite the highe&s;t ideas of the
trade and con&s;equence of this flouri&s;hing
port. The variety of canals, bridges, and
wharfs, are likewi&s;e de&s;erving of admiration.
By their canals, &s;hips of con&s;iderable bur|den
are laden at the merchant's doors;
and the wharfs, which are convenient and
exten&s;ive, are covered with innumerable
commodities, principally for the &s;upply of
the army and navy in America.</P>
<P>By my friend Mr. C&mdash;, I was fa|voured
with a letter of introduction to Mr.
B&mdash;, a merchant of great re&s;pectability
in this port; from whom I have received
a frank and general invitation to his table,
<PB N="452" REF="500">
during the time that inclination or ne|ce&s;&s;ity
may detain me in this city.</P>
<P>There are few per&s;ons in whom the pa&s;|&s;ion
of curio&s;ity is more predominant than
in my&s;elf; and the environs of Cork pro|mi&s;e
abundant gratification to an inqui&s;i|tive
mind; but as the fir&s;t object of my
pur&s;uit relates to you, and to our deare&s;t
boy, I have no wi&s;h for an opportunity to
make any excur&s;ion, foreign to the thoughts
that engro&s;s my mind in my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;age, <DATE>Dec. 25.</DATE></P>
<P>Ye&s;terday I took leave of Cork, and
came to this place in order to embark for
Bri&s;tol. About noon we expect to &s;ail.</P>
<P>I &s;hall quit Ireland with deep impre&s;|&s;ions
of gratitude. The entertainment I
have experienced, greatly exceeds the high
ideas I had been taught to form of Iri&s;h ho&s;|pitality.
May they continue to enjoy every
<PB N="453" REF="501">
ble&s;&s;ing which liberty, indu&s;try, and pro&s;|perity
can afford.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave this to be forwarded by
the po&s;t. Should a favourable gale crown
my wi&s;hes, it is po&s;&s;ible&mdash;nay, proba|ble
&mdash;that I may be happily re-united to
my deare&s;t partner, before &s;he will receive
this &s;ervent a&s;&s;urance of my unalterable
attachment. The hour&mdash;the long ex|pected
hour&mdash;is at hand, which will re|&s;tore
to us the ble&s;&s;ings of dome&s;tic feli|city.
Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLII.</HEAD>
<P>Ilfracomb, Devon, <DATE>27th Dec.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM &s;afely landed on my native &s;hore.
The po&s;t departs for London within
an hour: I gladly embrace the opportu|nity
<PB N="454" REF="502">
to give you an account of my $a$e ar|rival,
and explain the circum&s;tances which
occa&s;ioned an alteration in my intended
route.</P>
<P>I emba$ked at Pa&s;&s;age on Chri&s;tmas|day,
but the wind would not permit us to
fail till the en&s;uing morning. From thence
to the i&s;le of Lundy we had a prodigious
run, having accompli&s;hed near fifty leagues
in about twenty-four hours. The wind
then became contrary, and we were happy
to gain this harbour, where the ma&s;ter of
the ve&s;&s;el means to await an alteration of
weather in his favour.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance from this place to Bri&s;tol is
reckoned twenty-five leagues; but on ac|count
of the &s;trong tides which prevail in
this channel, &s;hort as the pa&s;&s;age is, it
cannot well be attempted again&s;t an ad|ver&s;e
wind; and as pre&s;ent appearances
do not indicate a &s;peedy change, I have
<PB N="455" REF="503">
determined to re&s;ign the plan of pro&s;ecut|ing
the voyage, and &s;hall, therefore, de|part
by land, the in&s;tant my baggage has
pa&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary examination.</P>
<P>When you receive your hu&s;band to your
faithful arms, let every anxious idea be
excluded&mdash;let us unite in recounting pa&s;t
deliverances, and be thus animated to look
forward with gratitude and confidence. Our
di&s;appointments and our misfortunes have
originated from inevitable cau&s;es; and if
adver&s;ity &s;hould &s;till continue to oppo&s;e
our be&s;t endeavours, we mu&s;t derive con|&s;olation
from reflecting that we have acted
con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;entiments which we
profe&s;&s;ed, and with a con&s;cientious regard
to the duties of that &s;tation in which Pro|vidence
had placed us, always remember|ing
that though
<Q><L>&startq;'Tis not in mortals to command &s;ucce&s;s,</L>
<L>They may do more&mdash;DESERVE IT.&endq;</L></Q></P>
