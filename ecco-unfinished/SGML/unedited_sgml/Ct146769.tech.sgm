<HEAD>TO
SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Can have no expectations in an addre&s;s of this
kind, either to add to your reputation, or to
e&s;tabli&s;h my own. You can gain nothing from
my admiration, as I am ignorant of that art in
which you are &s;aid to excel; and I may lo&s;e
much by the &s;everity of your judgment, as few
have a ju&s;ter ta&s;te in poetry than you. Setting in|tere&s;t
therefore a&s;ide, to which I never paid much
attention, I mu&s;t be indulged at pre&s;ent in fol|lowing
my affections. The only dedication I ever
made was to my brother, becau&s;e I loved him bet|ter
than mo&s;t other men. He is &s;ince dead. Per|mit
me to in&s;cribe this Poem to you.</P>
<P>How far you may be plea&s;ed with the ver&s;i&s;ica|tion
and mere mechanical parts of this attempt,
I don't pretend to enquire; but I know you will
object (and indeed &s;everal of our be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t
friends concur in the opinion) that the depopula|tion
it deplores is no where to be &s;een, and the
di&s;orders it laments are only to be found in the
poet's own imagination. To this I can &s;carce
make any other an&s;wer than that I &s;incerely be|lieve
what I have written; that I have taken all
<PB REF="5">
po&s;&s;ible pains, in my country excur&s;ions, for the&s;e
four or five years pa&s;t, to be certain of what I
alledge, and that all my views and enquiries have
led me to believe tho&s;e mi&s;eries real, which I here
attempt to di&s;play. But this is not the place to
enter into an enquiry, whether the country be de|populating,
or not; the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion would take up
much room, and I &s;hould prove my&s;elf, at be&s;t,
an indifferent politician, to tire the reader with a
long preface, when I want his unfatigued atten|tion
to a long poem.</P>
<P>In regretting the depopulation of the country,
I inveigh again&s;t the increa&s;e of our luxuries; and
here al&s;o I expect the &s;hout of modern politicians
again&s;t me. For twenty or thirty years pa&s;t, it
has been the fa&s;hion to con&s;ider luxury as one of
the greate&s;t national advantages; and all the wi&s;|dom
of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous.
Still however, I mu&s;t remain a profe&s;&s;ed ancient
on that head, and continue to think tho&s;e luxu|ries
prejudicial to &s;tates, by which &s;o many vices
are introduced, and &s;o many kingdoms have been
undone. Indeed, &s;o much has been poured out
of late on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, that,
merely for the &s;ake of novelty and variety, one
would &s;ometimes wi&s;h to be in the right.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>dear SIR,</SALUTE>
Your &s;incere friend and ardent admirer,

<L>A man he was, to all the country dear,</L>

<L>Remote from towns he ran his godly race,</L>
<L>Nor e'er had changed, nor wi&s;h'd to change his

<L>Un&s;kilful he to fawn, or &s;eek for power,</L>
<L>By doctrines fa&s;hioned to the varying hour;</L>

<L>Sate by his &s;ire, and talked the night away;</L>
<L>Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of &s;orrow done,</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,</L>

<L>And, as a bird each fond endearment tries;</L>
<L>To tempt its new-fledged off spring to the &s;kies;</L>
