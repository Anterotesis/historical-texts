<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have nothing to &s;ay in behalf of the
following papers, but that they are
chiefly intended for the great body of Chri|&s;tians,
called <HI>the common people,</HI> who
have but little time, and as little money,
for buying and reading large books. The
character of &s;uch readers makes it like|wi&s;e
nece&s;&s;ary that this &s;mall performance
&s;hould be as plain and familiar as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I mentioned &s;ome cau&s;es of the thought|le&s;sne&s;s
of mankind, which po&s;&s;ibly may be
reckoned more applicable to tho&s;e in high
&s;tations. But the lowe&s;t ranks of men are
too much &s;et upon their plea&s;ures, and
are &s;till projecting to rai&s;e them&s;elves
higher. As for tho&s;e in higher &s;tations,
when they are arrived at the utmo&s;t their
ambition can de&s;ire, (&s;uch is the empti|ne&s;s
of things), they are continually &s;earch|ing
after new plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements:</P>
<P>When the woful effects of the fall were
taken notice of (<HI>chap.</HI> 4.), the li&s;t might
have been made fuller, and more &s;aid con|cerning
the corruption of the heart: but
perhaps there is enough &s;aid to make us
&s;en&s;ible of our fallen &s;tate, which pride
&s;eems to have occa&s;ioned; as may be in|ferred
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
from the pre&s;ent di&s;grace and mi|&s;ery
we are under; a frail body, full of
di&s;ea&s;es, and other no le&s;s humbling things.
And what have we to boa&s;t of as to the
&s;oul? A defective memory, a confu&s;ed
judgment, a giddy imagination, a per|ver&s;e
will, a crowd of pa&s;&s;ions, that give
us no re&s;t, and make the earth de&s;olate.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, we ought not
to forget the happy pro&s;pect which the
&s;cripture gives us of a glorious and ble&s;&s;|ed
&s;tate hereafter, wherein all imperfec|tions
and &s;orrows are done away.</P>
<P>In chap. 11. the cro&s;s was brought in
a little abruptly; and perhaps too ha|&s;tily
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. This is indeed true, that
the cro&s;&s;es and vexations which people
create to one another, are very much owing
to the mutual defects of their own tem|pers.
But the cro&s;s implies all the varie|ty
of &s;uffering we can po&s;&s;ibly imagine,
and it is the nece&s;&s;ary medicine for curing
all the di&s;orders which &s;in hath brought
upon us. It may be reckoned, that every
cro&s;s laid on us by the un&s;earchable provi|dence
of God, is fitted to &s;ome di&s;order in
our nature, frequently unknown to us:
and we may conclude in general, that
&s;ince our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour (who was pu|rity
it&s;elf) made choice of the cro&s;s, and
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
&s;ufferings, we (who are polluted with
&s;in) can have no other way of arriving
at happine&s;s. Holy writ confirms it often.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to have di&s;covered
all the faults of the book. In chap. 17.
chearfulne&s;s is called a virtue; which
perhaps will be di&s;puted: for though a
certain &s;ort of chearfulne&s;s may be &s;aid
to be the effect of the highe&s;t virtue, (joy
and peace being fruits of the Holy Spirit,
and a good con&s;cience a continual fea&s;t);
yet ordinary and natural chearfulne&s;s is
no more to be called a virtue, than bold|ne&s;s,
timorou&s;ne&s;s, ba&s;hfulne&s;s, or even
&s;adne&s;s, when they proceed merely from
the natural temper. I grant, the chear|fulne&s;s
which proceeds merely from the
natural temper is not to be called a vir|tue;
but the chearfulne&s;s I had in view,
was a certain mixture of gaiety and com|plai&s;ance,
in oppo&s;ition to moro&s;ene&s;s and
&s;ullenne&s;s, which can never do honour to
religion.</P>
<P>Much more might have been added, if
the de&s;ign had not been to make a very
&s;mall book: and what is chiefly intended
by it is, to &s;tir up people to the &s;tudy of
the holy &s;criptures, in which all is con|tained
that we ought to believe and prac|ti&s;e.
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
There are many pious books<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Such as <HI>the Imitation of Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;everal books of that &s;piritual kind, proper for all ranks and conditions.</NOTE>,
which, though inferior to the &s;criptures,
are to be highly e&s;teemed, as well as &s;e|veral
books of an inferior cla&s;s: the
reader may rank them as he thinks pro|per.
And when we have no book in our
hands, we have the excellency of the
Chri&s;tian religion to think of, the purity
and peaceablene&s;s of its doctrine, with
the comfortable hopes it gives its &s;in|cere
followers. The thoughts of death,
judgment, and eternity, will &s;ometimes
enter into the mind, notwith&s;tanding all
the pains that we are at to bani&s;h them
from it; and at &s;uch times, what can
&s;upport us but the doctrine of the go&s;pel?
To &s;ay nothing of the terrors of death, we
had need to have recour&s;e to religion to
&s;upport us in the common difficulties of
life.</P>

our condition.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;MAN that is born of a wo|man,
is of few days, and
full of trouble. He co|meth
forth like a flower, and
is cut down: he fleeth al&s;o as a
&s;hadow, and continueth not<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xiv. 1. 2.</NOTE>.&endq;
&startq;Verily every man at his be&s;t &s;tate
is altogether vanity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxix. 5.</NOTE>.&endq; Our own
experience teaches us the &s;ame truths;
$ut as we know them only in a con|fu&s;ed
manner, &s;o we think very little
about them. Our &s;hort time pa&s;&s;es
<PB N="2" REF="9">
away in folly, till we are &s;urpri&s;ed
by death. Several cau&s;es may be gi|ven
for this thoughtle&s;sne&s;s. Our
heart is almo&s;t continually inten$
upon &s;ome plea&s;ure or diver&s;ion, and
our head taken up with airy projects$
or if we find our&s;elves &s;ometimes $
little di&s;engaged, and in a di&s;po&s;itio$
to think of our true &s;tate, and the
great end of our creation, we are pre|&s;ently
di&s;couraged with gloomy pro|&s;pects,
and the mi&s;ery that ca&s;ts up
to us.</P>
<P>No doubt we are poor and mi&s;er|able:
but this &s;hould not hinder u$
from con&s;idering the whole of ou$
condition, &s;ince we pretend to be rea|&s;onable
creatures, and often to be ve|ry
wi&s;e.</P>
<P>A little con&s;ideration might &s;hew
us, that we are not mi&s;erable beyon$
hope of recovery: very few are alto|gether
without &s;ome expectation o$
happine&s;s in the next world, afte$
this <HI>painful life</HI> is ended; and if w$
give attention to the &s;cripture, w$
&s;hall find many pa&s;&s;ages to confir$
<PB N="3" REF="10">
our hopes. The &s;ame holy per&s;on
Job &s;ays, &startq;I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at
the latter day upon the earth.&endq; He
adds, &startq;And though, after my &s;kin,
worms de&s;troy this body, yet in
my fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee God: whom I
&s;hall &s;ee for my&s;elf, and mine eyes
&s;hall behold, and not another<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xix. 25. 26. 27.</NOTE>.&endq;
Here is a glorious expectation of de|liverance,
and of the re&s;urrection.
Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and his apo&s;tles
give that doctrine &s;till a greater force.</P>
<P>Mankind therefore &s;hould not be
without hopes, but their confidence
&s;hould be only in their Redeemer.
For, alas! what mi&s;erable creatures are
we!</P>
<P>We cannot think too meanly of
our&s;elves, as we are fallen creatures,
and &s;o wretchedly disfigured by &s;in.
But le&s;t the dwelling too much upon
this thought &s;hould ca&s;t us into de|&s;pair,
we mu&s;t think of the mercy
and power of God, who can renew
us body and &s;oul. He can &startq;create
<PB N="4" REF="11">
in us a clean heart.&endq; and &startq;change
our vile body, that it may be fa|&s;hioned
like unto his glorious bo|dy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 21.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>We were created at fir&s;t &startq;after
the image of God.&endq; Who could
believe this, con&s;idering what we are
now? But the &s;cripture declares it,
and that is enough. We even find in
our pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;omething that looks
like great about us. We abhor to be
thought capable of ba&s;e actions. We
aim at a good character before men.
Again, nothing in this world can ful|ly
&s;atisfy our hearts, which looks as
if they were made for the enjoyment
of God, &s;ince nothing le&s;s than he
can fill them. And the abhorrence
of being thought ba&s;e, looks like &s;ome
remains of dignity in our nature.
When a per&s;on has no &s;en&s;e of
&s;hame, there is nothing that is good
to be expected from him.</P>
<P>But as we are <HI>high</HI> in &s;ome re&s;pects,
we are very <HI>low</HI> in others. The&s;e are
two points which we mu&s;t con&s;tantly
<PB N="5" REF="12">
keep in view, that we may not either
be proud like the devil, or level our|&s;elves
with the bea&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The true knowledge of our&s;elves, and
the &s;tate of things, only to be had
from the &s;criptures.</HEAD>
<P>EXperience may teach us &s;omewhat,
but the &s;criptures only can teach
us fully and truly. We mu&s;t read at|tentively,
otherwi&s;e it does not de|&s;erve
the name of reading. Another
thing requi&s;ite for under&s;tanding the
&s;criptures is <HI>an hone&s;t heart:</HI> We mu&s;t
bring with us a &s;incere intention of
doing our duty, as &s;oon as we under|&s;tand
it; without which we only cheat
our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not read that we may flat|ter
our vanity, or to appear know|ing.
The end of our reading, and
of all our actions, mu&s;t be to plea&s;e
God, and to give glory to his name.</P>
<P>If we read the holy &s;criptures with
<PB N="6" REF="13">
the&s;e good di&s;po&s;itions, or a right frame
of heart, we &s;hall learn out of them all
that is nece&s;&s;ary to make us perfectly
happy in the next world, and even
much happier here than otherwi&s;e we
could be: For the &s;criptures have
come from the Spirit of God, the
fountain of all wi&s;dom. There may
be very u&s;eful books written by good
men, but they are only borrowed
lights, and dim in compari&s;on of the
&s;criptures.</P>
<P>When we open tho&s;e &s;acred books,
we &s;hould put up a private petition to
Almighty God, &startq;That he would
give us the true under&s;tanding of
what we read,&endq; le&s;t we read like
children. We mu&s;t al&s;o pray, &startq;That
God would give us a ready heart
to obey his will in all that he plea|&s;es
to di&s;cover of it to us,&endq; le&s;t we
read like hypocrites.</P>
<P>We cannot deny that our duty is
laid down plainly to us in the &s;crip|tures:
common &s;en&s;e is enough to
let us &s;ee it. But we are for the mo&s;t
part in &s;uch a hurry when we read, or
<PB N="7" REF="14">
hear others, that all goes for nothing.
In&s;tead of minding what we read or
hear, our thoughts are carried away
with a thou&s;and impertinent things.
And &s;uppo&s;e our attention were great|er
than it is, yet our fooli&s;h de&s;ires
and pa&s;&s;ions blind us; and &startq;the
cares of the world choke the good
&s;eed,&endq; as our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in|forms
us.</P>
<P>But I &s;ay again, our duty is plain.
Our Saviour conde&s;cended to &s;peak
to the meane&s;t capacities, and made
u&s;e of the mo&s;t familiar parables.
His apo&s;tles teach us our duty al&s;o:
and we find it in the Old Te&s;tament
it&s;elf. God is never wanting upon
his part.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we cannot de|ny
that there are &s;everal things in the
&s;criptures very dark, according to our
natural apprehen&s;ion, and which can
only be made intelligible by the &s;ame
Spirit from whence they came. But
to this Spirti no bounds can be &s;et: it
can teach the &s;oul immediately; it
can explain dark pa&s;&s;ages; it can
<PB N="8" REF="15">
make a light to &s;pring up in the &s;oul,
without letters or &s;ounds, or any
thing that can &s;trike the outward &s;en|&s;es.
He who formed the &s;oul can in|&s;truct
it after many ways and man|ners
that human rea&s;on can have no
comprehen&s;ion of.</P>
<P>All we have to do is, to follow the
light that is given us; and when God
&s;ees us fit for higher things, he will
not be wanting. We ought not to
aim at what is extraordinary. David
&s;aid, &startq;He did not exerci&s;e him&s;elf in
things too high for him, but be|haved
like a weaned child<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxxi. 1. 2.</NOTE>.&endq; Such
high aims are liable to the puni&s;h|ment
of delu&s;ion, which they well de|&s;erve.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of &s;ome principal truths taught us in
holy writ.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;criptures teach us our du|ty,
plainly, fully, and truly. The&s;e
three qualities cannot but concur in
<PB N="9" REF="16">
them, &s;ince they are the in&s;pirations
of God. They al&s;o teach us many
things concerning the divine nature
and our own, the end we are made
for, and the cour&s;e we mu&s;t follow in
order to eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>We feel the incon&s;tancy and di&s;or|der
of every thing here. Our body is
a ma&s;s of corruption, and liable every
moment to pain and torture in every
pore and atom of it, and the whole
fabric ready to fall to pieces, like a
ruinous hou&s;e. Our &s;oul, though
of an immortal nature, is however in
a very poor &s;tate here: pa&s;&s;ions, ima|ginations,
delu&s;ions, cares, &s;orrows,
the&s;e are commonly the trouble&s;ome
gue&s;ts of the &s;oul. We have not
names for all the evils we feel and
fear. All the elements are again&s;t us:
the air we breathe often carries death
in it; men are our open enemies;
and &startq;the devil walketh about, like a
roaring lion, &s;eeking whom he may
devour<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 8.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>There are other things in our pre|&s;ent
<PB N="10" REF="17">
&s;tate more agreeable; plea&s;ures
of the body and mind. Hardly is a|ny
per&s;on &s;o de&s;titute as to have no
friend; and one &s;ingle friend is a
great trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But &s;till man's life is full of trouble,
and he is full of contradictions him|&s;elf;
&s;ome good qualities in him, and
many bad.</P>
<P>It is the &s;cripture that &s;hews us how
the&s;e contrary things have come to
pa&s;s. In informs us, that the fir&s;t
man <HI>Adam</HI> was created in an upright
and happy &s;tate; but that he fell, and
all his po&s;terity in him, &s;ince he could
produce none in his corruption but
corrupt creatures like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It informs us, that God was plea&s;ed
to pardon <HI>Adam</HI> and his po&s;terity, at
the interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who
took our nature upon him, (except
the &s;inful part of it), and &s;atisfied the
divine ju&s;tice by his bitter death<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Man's redemption by Ie&s;us Chri&s;t is fre|quently mentioned in &s;cripture, and is one of the my&s;teries unfathomable by human rea&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It informs us, that though man was
<PB N="11" REF="18">
thus pardoned, yet he was driven out
of Paradi&s;e, and the earth <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> for
his &s;ake; that being condemned to
hard labour, and many vexations, he
might be in le&s;s hazard of doting on
his pre&s;ent jail, and might have his
eye fixed on a better world.</P>
<P>It informs us, that man's know|ledge
was much darkened by the fall,
and all his faculties di&s;tempered and
poi&s;oned; that he is now a proud,
angry, fooli&s;h creature; timorous,
&s;lothful, re&s;tle&s;s; every thing by turns,
and nothing for any continuance.</P>
<P>It informs us, on the other hand,
that there are great remains of dignity
in our nature; that, notwith&s;tanding
all our defects and mi&s;eries, we are
&s;till the children of God, and &startq;joint
heirs with Chri&s;t.&endq; What amazing
and endearing expre&s;&s;ions!</P>
<P>It informs us, that our title to the&s;e
glorious and ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;es is of the
pure mercy of God, and only owing
to the merits of his well-beloved Son;
that we mu&s;t take nothing to our|&s;elves
but <HI>&s;hame and confu&s;ion,</HI> nor
<PB N="12" REF="19">
flatter our&s;elves with the hopes of be|ing
acceptable to God without faith
and repentance, and the imitation of
all the virtues of our Lord and Sa|viour,
as far as is po&s;&s;ible for us.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the principal
truths which the holy &s;criptures teach
us, and what we could never have
di&s;covered without revelation. It helps
to reconcile the contradictions we find
in our own nature. Man is neither
bea&s;t, nor devil, and far le&s;s a God;
but he has &s;omething in him of all the
three: experience &s;hews it in his
actions. Things are done by man
which look more diabolical than hu|man;
and there are things brutal to
the la&s;t degree; but there are other
things (it is a pity they are &s;o few)
which look very like divine.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Death.</HEAD>
<P>ONE grievous effect of the fall was
death: for God only threatened
it upon man's di&s;obedience. &startq;It is
appointed for all men once to die,
and after that the judgment.&endq; This
is a &s;entence we cannot think of with|out
horror. Nature &s;hrinks at its
di&s;&s;olution. Every creature that hath
life, endeavours to pre&s;erve it. To
&s;ay nothing of future apprehen&s;ions,
nature hath implanted in us a dread
of lo&s;ing our pre&s;ent exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But with rational creatures there
would be le&s;s fear of death, if it were
not for the <HI>judgment</HI> that comes after
it. Men would fear death, and &s;hun
danger, as other living creatures do;
but if they thought of what is to fol|low,
they would be in great perplexity;
and nothing could &s;upport them but
the con&s;ideration of the goodne&s;s of
God.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29">
But alas! we think very little about
death. We are &s;tupid and drunk
with the low plea&s;ures of this world;
and when we begin to think of
that fatal period, we &s;oon give it
over, the pro&s;pect is &s;o dark and di&s;|mal.</P>
<P>It is not always becau&s;e we are &s;or|ry
to part with the joys of life, that
the thoughts of death overwhelm us.
We find per&s;ons who&s;e life may be
reckoned a burden to them, and yet
they would gladly lengthen it if they
could; which is a &s;trong pre&s;umption
that they have &s;ome fear of entering
into another &s;tate, and undergoing
the judgment of God.</P>
<P>If that were not the ca&s;e, if there
were not a &s;ecret impre&s;&s;ion of a fu|ture
&s;tate, &s;imple death could not be
&s;o terrible a pro&s;pect to a rea&s;onable
creature; it would be but like a deep
&s;leep, and a real relief from many trou|bles.
No more oppre&s;&s;ion, no more
calumny, no more toil, no more pain,
no more grief. &startq;There the wicked
<PB N="23" REF="30">
cea&s;e from troubling, and there
the weary are at re&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job iii. 17.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>But naturally &s;ome horror mu&s;t $be
elt at the thoughts of our leaving
$he body: for the &s;oul knows not
whither it is going, and &startq;it is a fear|ful
thing to fall into the hands of
the living God.&endq;</P>
<P>Let us not however be &s;o afraid of
$eath, as if we had no hope in God.
$ur Saviour hath &startq;overcome the
&s;harpne&s;s of death, and opened the
kingdom of heaven to all belie|vers;&endq;
that is, to all who truly be|$eve
his doctrine, and faithfully imi|$ate
his example. Belief alone is not
$$fficient, for &startq;the devils believe and
tremble.&endq;</P>
<P>Let us think of death, as what it is,
$word$ wit, a relea&s;e from a painful life,
$nd the end of a tedious journey. At
$e &s;ame time, we mu&s;t look upon it
$s the puni&s;hment of guilt in our fir&s;t
$arents, and a ju&s;t condemnation of
$ur own pride. It is very ju&s;t that
$ur high heads &s;hould be laid low,
<PB N="24" REF="31">
and that the worms &s;hould feed on
our bodies, which many of us have
treated with &s;o much expence and
care.</P>
<P>Let us, on the other hand, think
of death, as an entrance into a &s;tate
of happine&s;s, or into a <HI>ho&uacute;&s;e</HI> which
our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour hath prepared for
tho&s;e that love him. This pro&s;pect
would fill us with joy, when we con|&s;ider,
that &startq;our light affliction, which
is but for a moment, worketh for
us a far more exeeeding and eter|nal
weight of glory.&endq;</P>
<P>But our compo&s;ition is very &s;trange!
neither the thoughts of heaven nor
hell affect us; we live as if we were
never to die; the pre&s;ent peri&s;hing
things only touch us; we talk of
hopes and fears in the next world,
but our affections are only &s;et upon
this earth; any little good we do is
chiefly &startq;to be &s;een of men;&endq; and if
we ab&s;tain from any evil, it is chiefly
for fear of their reproach. Yet tho&s;e
very men we are thus afraid of, mu&s;t
die like our&s;elves; and we &s;ee our
<PB N="25" REF="32">
friends and acquaintance dropping e|very
day: but for all this we never
change our conduct; we live as if we
were immortal, and our names ne|ver
to be forgotten!</P>
<P>How would the thoughts of death
put a &s;top to our extravagant and &s;illy
pur&s;uits! how would it check our
unlawful plea&s;ures, and make us mo|derate
in tho&s;e that are lawful!</P>
<P>We are but like &s;hadows or appa|ritions
upon this earth, and mu&s;t &s;oon
give place to others, perhaps as vain
and fooli&s;h as our&s;elves. Who is it
that reflects &s;eriou&s;ly on the&s;e things?
&startq;Lord help us &s;o to live, that we
may not be too much afraid to
die.&endq;</P>
<P>How dreadful will it be at death to
$ook back upon a life &s;pent in drink|ing,
&s;wearing, lewdne&s;s, covetou&s;ne&s;s,
$fraud, oppre&s;&s;ion, or in any of the
works of the fle&s;h! not only to think
upon the evil we have done, but the
good that we have omitted! If &s;ome
particular per&s;ons &s;eem to die without
any appearance of remor&s;e or fear,
<PB N="26" REF="33">
we are not &s;ure but they feel more
than they acknowledge, and that
they may take pains to conceal what
they feel. If there be no remor&s;e at
all, it mu&s;t either be from &s;tupidity,
or a hardne&s;s of heart, contracted by
&s;tifling the repeated checks of con|&s;cience.
For, generally &s;peaking,
con&s;cience does &s;tir; and it is very na|tural
to fear that fatal period, which
not only &s;eparates us from all that is
dear to us in this world, but which is
like ca&s;ting us from a precipice into a
gulf without bottom.</P>

<P>MAN's fir&s;t &s;tate was a &s;tate of in|nocence;
the pre&s;ent is a &s;tate
of guilt. We need not wonder then
to find many things unea&s;y to us,
&s;ince we are criminals, (being the po|&s;terity
of <HI>Adam</HI>), and &s;ent here for a
&s;hort time of trial. We are not ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="27" REF="34">
condemned, but conditionally:
that is, if we do wickedly, we &s;hall
die; and if we righteou&s;ly, we &s;hall
live. St <HI>Paul</HI> confirms it: &startq;If ye
live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die; but
if ye through the Spirit do mortify
the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall
live<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 13.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the heart of man is cor|rupted
by &s;in, and his under&s;tanding
&s;o darkened, that his thoughts are &s;et
upon the pre&s;ent world; it is happy
for him that he is not now in a para|di&s;e,
and that this world mu&s;t di&s;ap|point
and vex him; otherwi&s;e (as is
ob&s;erved already) he would have been
more allured than he is.</P>
<P>The earth was therefore deprived
of its primitive fruitfulne&s;s and beau|ty,
that man might &s;et his heart le&s;s
upon it; his body was made weak,
that he might feel the unea&s;ine&s;s of
$oil; and his labour mu&s;t be attend|ed
with uncertainty, to le&s;&s;en his co|vetou&s;ne&s;s,
and to teach him to de|pend
<PB N="28" REF="35">
upon God only for his nece&s;&s;a|ry
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The earth was fitted to the &s;tate of
man's frail body, and his body fitted
to the di&s;orders of his &s;oul; all fitted
well together. To have put a per|ver&s;e
mi&s;chievous &s;oul into a body
that could not be wearied, would
have produced terrible effects. The
nece&s;&s;ities of refre&s;hment and re&s;t give
&s;ome little peace to mankind. Nor is
our weakne&s;s a greater re&s;traint upon
our mi&s;chievou&s;ne&s;s and tyranny, than
upon our debauchery and intempe|rance.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God
is exceeding remarkable in mixing
and tempering all things &s;o well.
Man's violence is re&s;trained by his
weakne&s;s; his life has been &s;hortened
once and again; and it is very probable
the earth is le&s;s plea&s;ant and fertile
&s;ince the flood.</P>
<P>But &s;till a thou&s;and delights and
beauties remain. <HI>The light is &s;weet&punc;</HI>
the &s;un is glorious; and the moon
and &s;tars have their particular beau|ties.
<PB N="29" REF="36">
Then there are the numberle&s;s
beauties of the field, the corn, the
gra&s;s, the trees, flowers, herbs, foun|tains,
rivers, the &s;ea, every thing &s;o
agreeable and &s;o u&s;eful, that we would
almo&s;t think our&s;elves in paradi&s;e &s;till.</P>
<P>All our &s;en&s;es, as well as our eyes,
are delightfully entertained; the ear
with mu&s;ic, and &s;o of all the re&s;t.
And how many plea&s;ures are there of
the under&s;tanding and the heart! It
is plea&s;ure to acquire knowledge, and
more plea&s;ure to acquire friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>But our eyes mu&s;t &s;oon be clo&s;ed
as to all created objects, and &s;ickne&s;s
makes us lo&s;e the reli&s;h of them in
the mean time: nothing is durable
and fixed. But all this uncertainty is
good with re&s;pect to a higher end.
We are made for a better world, and
it is good for us to get warnings that
we mu&s;t leave the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Death it&s;elf is good, as being a
&s;tate of re&s;t to tho&s;e &startq;that die in the
Lord;&endq; a &s;tate at lea&s;t (as is gene|rally
believed) where temptation is at
an end. It is &s;ometimes good with
<PB N="30" REF="37">
re&s;pect to tho&s;e that &s;urvive, for it rids
the earth of mon&s;ters: but this is the
mo&s;t melancholy con&s;ideration of all,
that &s;uch mon&s;ters &s;hould be.</P>
<P>Let us think of the goodne&s;s and
wi&s;dom of God, in ordering the dif|ferent
periods or &s;tages of life. How
fit is it that man is born helple&s;s, to
create compa&s;&s;ion and care! the di|&s;tre&s;s
of the mother rai&s;es pity, as
well as the condition of the crying in|fant.
How proper is childhood for
taming and in&s;tructing the &s;ierce and
ignorant &s;pirit! Youth has its di&s;ci|pline
too. Riper years have their &s;e|veral
cro&s;&s;es laid upon them; and
poor old age is made up of wearine&s;t
and &s;orrow, in order to make us leave
the world with the better will.</P>
<P>The changes of the &s;ea&s;ons are of
benefit, and &s;ome plea&s;ure. We love
variety; and tho&s;e changes help to
make us depend a little more on Pro|vidence,
and al&s;o to keep us in mind
that nothing is la&s;ting here: the
&s;pring draws on the &s;ummer, the
&s;ummer the harve&s;t, the harve&s;t the
<PB N="31" REF="38">
winter, and the winter the &s;pring;
and they are nece&s;&s;ary as well as beau|tiful
in their time.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould we forget the goodne&s;s
and wi&s;dom of God in appointing
work and labour for man &s;ince the
fall: it not only re&s;trains him from
doing mi&s;chief, but refre&s;hes his &s;pi|rits,
when it is not exce&s;&s;ive. None
are &s;o dull and heavy as tho&s;e that
are idle: we &s;ee what difficulty they
have to pa&s;s the time, and the filly di|ver&s;ions
they fall upon to keep up
their &s;pirits. The lower ranks of
mankind are happy in that point, if
they knew it. We may plainly &s;ee
the hand of God in the contrivance
of labour; for he might ea&s;ily have
made the earth not only produce
without any pains or toil, but he
might al&s;o have made us le&s;s &s;ubject
to other nece&s;&s;ities. This body gives
much work to feed it, and clothe it,
and keep it clean. But his wi&s;dom
extends to every thing; the good of
particular per&s;ons is provided for, as
well as the quiet of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39">
But there are yet higher things to
con&s;ider. Man was made to love
God. If there had been more per|fection
in created things, he would
have forgot his chief end entirely.
Our own imperfections &s;hould make
us think our&s;elves le&s;s lovely than
commonly we do, and con&s;equently
beat down our pride: and the imper|fections
of others &s;eem de&s;igned to

&startq;God is mighty to &s;ave.&endq; Our
friends even make us &s;uffer by their
defects, and we make them &s;uffer by
ours. Among the be&s;t friends there
is re&s;erve and clo&s;ene&s;s, but we may
lay our&s;elves open to God, as hoping
that he will help us without <HI>upbraid|ing
us.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay, the defects of all created
things are of u&s;e to make us look up
to the all-perfect creator. Our de|caying
bodies, which we pamper and
<PB N="33" REF="40">
adorn, are &s;oon to be the food of
worms. But this may make us think
of a more durable and finer &s;tate in
another world. And we &s;hould often
ca&s;t our eye to the great promi&s;es in
the &s;criptures, both that we be not
cheated with the empty plea&s;ures here,
nor ca&s;t down when we think of the
numberle&s;s pains and &s;orrows that ne|ce&s;&s;arily
fall to our lot.</P>
<P>Infinite goodne&s;s draws good out
of every thing. Our very pa&s;&s;ions
and follies are &s;ometimes of u&s;e to
make us &s;omewhat more regular than
otherwi&s;e we would be; mutual fear
makes us careful not to &s;tir up one
another's anger, and to prevent bo|dily
harm; and the fear of cen&s;ure
and ill tongues is a con&s;iderable de|fence
of our weak virtue. We would
more frequently do ill, if we were not
afraid that ill would be &s;aid of us. I
grant this is not true virtue, nor can
any thing be acceptable to God when
it is only done upon worldly motives,
and &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations: however,
it is &s;o far good for us not to be
<PB N="34" REF="41">
wholly abandoned, or without &s;hame&punc;
for we may chance to reflect after|wards,
and find out the beauty of vir|tue
and religion, which we could ne|ver
do in a profligate cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>It is indeed very remarkable, that
di&s;appointments, trouble, fear, folly,
every thing, &s;hould produce &s;uch
happy effects! but it is mo&s;t worthy
of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, that
our own faults &s;hould mend us, by
making us humble; and that faults

<P><PB N="35" REF="42">
Mankind may be &s;aid to be God's
peculiar care: they are formed &startq;af|ter
his image;&endq; and &startq;his delights
are to be with the children of men.&endq;
So the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us.</P>
<P>In the &s;tate of innocence no plea|&s;ure
was denied; nothing was for|bidden
but the fruit of one tree;
and &startq;perhaps before it was forbid|den,
mankind began to be too a|&s;piring.&endq;
We are likely to remain
$n darkne&s;s concerning tho&s;e hidden
things, and mu&s;t &s;tick to the plain
hi&s;tory, that &startq;our fir&s;t parents fell.&endq;
Their fault was the le&s;s heinous, that
they were tempted by the devil, who&s;e
arrogance had made him fall before;
$e &s;aid &startq;he would be like the Mo&s;t
High<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xiv. 14.</NOTE>.&endq; This pride and folly of
our enemy is inconceivable; but St
<HI>Jude</HI> tells us of angels &startq;who kept not
their fir&s;t e&s;tate,&endq; and their arro|gance
mu&s;t have thru&s;t them down.
It cannot be otherwi&s;e (we may well
think) in the nature of things.</P>
<P>Certainly man has very little rea&s;on
<PB N="36" REF="43">
to be proud; and yet &s;ometimes he is
&s;aid to be as proud as <HI>Lucifer!</HI></P>
<P>But to humble this pride of man,
it plea&s;ed God to &s;ubject him to all
the mi&s;eries of body and &s;oul, which
we have hitherto mentioned, and can
never be enough &s;en&s;ible of. After
our Saviour's atonement for us, if we
were free of pride and other vices,
(though pride is the mo&s;t criminal),
our recovery would come of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;ay there is any man
that equals him&s;elf with God; but
&s;till it is arrogance if he does not give
God the glory of any gifts he has re|ceived
from him; and it is great folly
to think he has received more than
he hath, which is very often our ca&s;e</P>
<P>But the goodne&s;s of God follows
us at all times: he gives us good
things to enjoy, and mixes bitter
things with them, that we may not
be intoxicated or drunk with plea|&s;ure;
and to rai&s;e us our of our le|thargy,
he &s;ometimes inflicts the &s;e|vere&s;t
cha&s;ti&s;ements.</P>
<P>God hath moreover given to man|kind,
<PB N="37" REF="44">
at &s;everal times, expre&s;s mani|fe&s;tations
of his will, to the end they
might mend their lives, and e&s;cape his
wrath. Thus he warned the old
world by <HI>Noah,</HI> and thus he declared
him&s;elf to <HI>Abraham</HI> again&s;t <HI>Sodom</HI> and
<HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and in like manner to <HI>Jo|nas</HI>
again&s;t <HI>Nineveh;</HI> with many other
in&s;tances.</P>
<P>But, which is more remarkable,
when the light of nature was almo&s;t
extingui&s;hed, and the mo&s;t abomi|nable
things done by men, God was
plea&s;ed to give expre&s;s laws in writing
to a whole nation; by who&s;e example
$he re&s;t of the world might be reform|ed;
e&s;pecially when they con&s;idered
how much God had done, and what
$onders he had wrought for that
$eople. Let us think of the plagues
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the pa&s;&s;age through the
<HI>Red &s;ea,</HI> the journeying in the wilder|ne&s;s,
the <HI>manna,</HI> or food from hea|ven,
the water out of the rock, the
entry into the promi&s;ed land, and mi|raculous
victories over the inhabi|tants;
let us con&s;ider the&s;e things, and
<PB N="38" REF="45">
particularly the giving of the law with
thunder and lightning, and the &s;ha|king
of the mount, and we &s;hall find
the greate&s;t manife&s;tations of the di|vine
power that we can imagine.</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o con&s;ider all the cha&s;ti&s;e|ments
of that people, upon their fre|quent
falling into idolatry and wicked|ne&s;s,
their deliverances from their ene|mies,
new crimes, and new &s;lavery, ma|ny
things foretold by the prophets, and
the exact fulfilling of them; is not all
this enough to convince us of the great
&s;tupidity and perver&s;ene&s;s of human
nature, and of God's infinite mercy
and long-&s;uffering?</P>
<P>But nothing comes up to our Sa|viour's
taking our nature upon him,
and doing and &s;uffering for us what
he did. He came in the <HI>fulne&s;s of
time,</HI> the time that was fixed for his
coming, and marked by the prophet
<HI>Daniel</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was not able to
make &startq;the ob&s;ervers of it perfect<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 1.</NOTE>,&endq;
as the apo&s;tle tells the <HI>Hebrews</HI> very
<PB N="39" REF="46">
plainly. It was good for the purpo&s;es
that God de&s;igned it, and no more
was required but the faithful ob&s;er|vance
of it while it &s;tood. And many
pious and wonderful men were Jound
among the <HI>Iews</HI> before our Saviour
came into the world; yea, before the
law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> holy per&s;ons were found,
as <HI>Abraham,</HI> and others de&s;cended of
him; and holy men are found even
before the flood, for in&s;tance <HI>Enoch,</HI>
who walked with God, and <HI>Noah</HI>
him&s;elf; which &s;hews that in all pe|riods
of the world there have been
righteous per&s;ons, and con&s;equently
accepted of God.</P>
<P>But as wickedne&s;s increa&s;ed, new
methods were fallen upon by the wi&s;|dom
of God, who gave <HI>precept upon
precept,</HI> and <HI>&s;poke at divers times and

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some precepts and truths in the Chri|&s;tian
religion.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Saviour hath taught us truths
which we could not have known
without his light, and duties which
we cannot perform without his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance;
but he has promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
to all who &s;incerely a&s;k it. The
fir&s;t duty that may occur to us is
prayer, on account of our wants and
our dangers. The heart may be &s;aid
to have a way of &s;peaking to God
without words, &startq;with groans that can|not
be uttered:&endq; but when words are
to be u&s;ed, what can be &s;o fit as tho&s;e
our Saviour him&s;elf conde&s;cended to
$each? The mind indeed mu&s;t be in
$ right di&s;po&s;ition, otherwi&s;e all words
and de&s;ires are in vain. &startq;Ye a&s;k, and
have not,&endq; &s;ays the apo&s;tle<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">James iv. 3.</NOTE>, &startq;be|cau&s;e
ye a&s;k ami&s;s.&endq; For which rea&s;on
I mention the a&s;king &s;incerely, that is&punc;
<PB N="41" REF="48">
with a de&s;ign of plea&s;ing God, as well
as for any benefit to our&s;elves; or ra|ther,
we &s;hould &s;eek to plea&s;e God
in the fir&s;t place: this we &s;hould have
at heart, when we &s;ay, &startq;Thy king|dom
come: Thy will be done,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That prayer commonly called the
<HI>Lord's prayer,</HI> ought to be well con|&s;idered:
it &s;hews us our greatne&s;s, in
having God for our father; it &s;hews
us our wants, when we pray for <HI>our
daily bread;</HI> and our dangers, when
we pray to be <HI>delivered from evil:</HI> it
&s;hews us the mea&s;ure of forgiving o|thers,
namely, as we would wi&s;h to
be <HI>forgiven</HI> our&s;elves: it &s;hews us (if
I may &s;peak &s;o) how we ought to en|ter
into the intere&s;ts of God, when
we pray that <HI>his kingdom may come;</HI>
and how perfectly our own will ought
to be re&s;igned, when we pray that <HI>his
will may be done.</HI> I &s;hall leave all the
words of that mo&s;t divine and perfect
form of prayer to be con&s;idered in
their proper order.</P>
<P>If we would give attention, we
&s;hould &s;ee in how &s;mall compa&s;s our
<PB N="42" REF="49">
chief duties lie, with many truths of
the greate&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Prai&s;e and thank&s;giving are al&s;o
found in that &s;ame complete form of
prayer, and they are duties we are
highly obliged to perform: <HI>Be thank|ful
unto him, and &s;peak good of his
name.</HI> Prai&s;e is a chearful thing; the
mind could have no entertainment &s;o
plea&s;ant: prayer is a relief to the mind
in trouble; prai&s;e is a delight to it in
pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Public prai&s;e and prayer &s;tir up the
mind, and awaken it from its &s;lum|ber;
for we are a&s;leep as to heavenly
things, and our thoughts are often
wandering in the mid&s;t of our devo|tions;
but &s;till public devotions are of
great u&s;e.</P>
<P>Private prai&s;e and prayer may be
performed almo&s;t without interrup|tion,
the lifting up of the heart may
be &s;o frequent; and in tho&s;e private
devotions there is no fear of hypocri|&s;y
or o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>Meditation is another kind of pri|vate
devotion, in which the mind
<PB N="43" REF="50">
thinks of the power and wi&s;dom of
God, or any of his attributes: it con|&s;iders
the works of creation and pro|vidence;
and as the&s;e things cannot
be con&s;idered without delight, medi|tation
will naturally end in prai&s;e and
thank&s;giving; and when we think on
our own folly and corruption, toge|ther
with the &s;ad &s;tate of the earth,
our meditation will naturally end in
prayer. It is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who
are taken up with the low pur&s;uits of
the world, and who never pray but
for form's &s;ake, to comprehend what
delight others may have, who pray
from another &s;pirit; nor what di&s;co|veries
it may plea&s;e God to make un|to
them.</P>
<P>All the Chri&s;tian virtues are in&s;e|parably
linked together; but humili|ty
is a principal one, and without it
prayer would not be acceptable, nor
any thing that we could perform.
Humility has been called &startq;the altar
on which God would have us offer
our &s;acrifices:&endq; and this ju&s;tly; for
what can the wor&s;hip of the proud
<PB N="44" REF="51">
&s;ignify, who&s;e end in all their actions
is their own glory rather than God's?</P>
<P>The good effects of humility, and
the bad effects of pride, are both &s;een
in that excellent hymn of the Virgin
<HI>Mary,</HI> &startq;He hath put down the
mighty from their &s;eat, and hath
exalted the humble and meek,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We are taught to pray, that
&startq;God's kingdom may come;&endq; not
only his glorious reign in the next
world, which will come in his appoint|ed
time, but al&s;o that he may reign
in the &s;oul during the pre&s;ent life;
and this can only be in the &s;oul that
is humble; for &startq;God re&s;i&s;teth the
proud.&endq;</P>
<P>Nor can our prayers be of any u&s;e
to us, unle&s;s we deny our&s;elves, and
follow the example of our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour.
If we pretend to pray, with|out
ab&s;taining from what our con|&s;cience
tells us we ought to ab&s;tain, we
do not &startq;lift up pure hands.&endq;</P>
<P>Let us run over in our minds $word$
other duties and truths of Chri&s;tia|nity,
and this will help to give us a
<PB N="45" REF="52">
clearer view of that heavenly religion
than generally we have.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The manners of the pre&s;ent Chri&s;tians
compared with the doctrine of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THis compari&s;on is extreme melan|choly.
We &s;ee in the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles how great marks of love the
primitive Chri&s;tians expre&s;&s;ed to one
another, and to the whole earth.
They lived according to the doctrine
of their ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter; and we can|not
too often think of that doctrine
of univer&s;al love, and of all virtues.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould we ever forget our Sa|viour's
example, &s;ince example often
goes farther than precept. He lived
poor, we are eager to be rich: this is
enough to &s;hew how his example is
followed at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But we ought particularly to re|member
his manner of life before he
entered upon his mini&s;try&punc; He lived
<PB N="46" REF="53">
thirty years in an ob&s;cure and poo$
employment; he &s;hewed him&s;elf on|ly
to the world &startq;to obey the will of
him that &s;ent him;&endq; and to do
good to mankind; he &s;till continued
in his poverty, having no where to
lay his head; and &s;ubmitted to the
cruele&s;t affronts, and the &s;evere&s;t
death.</P>
<P>Many Chri&s;tians at fir&s;t imitated
their great ma&s;ter; they did not ru&s;h
into employments, they were content
with food and raiment, and patiently
endured hunger and thir&s;t, and the
greate&s;t poverty, contempt, impri&s;on|ment,
&s;courging, and death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When their numbers increa&s;ed,
they were &s;till more per&s;ecuted; and
it is almo&s;t incredible what they en|dured
for the name of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> under
the per&s;ecuting Emperors, for the
&s;pace of three hundred years. Shal$
I a&s;k, how many would &s;uffer martyr|dom
in this age?</P>
<P>Nothing would be more u&s;eful
than to have our Saviour's words
frequently in our mind, and to put
<PB N="47" REF="54">
$$e que&s;tion to our&s;elves, How do
$e ob&s;erve them? For in&s;tance:</P>
<P>$ Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, &startq;Lay not up for
your&s;elves trea&s;ures upon earth,
but lay up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures
in heaven.&endq; Do not we lay up as
$uch as we can, and &s;till covet more?
$o&s;t of our Saviour's precepts and
$oun&s;els have a rea&s;on joined to them,
$s, that the trea&s;ures of the earth are
$able to &s;o many accidents, and the
$eavenly trea&s;ures to none. The &s;ame
$b&s;ervation may be made of other of
$is ble&s;&s;ed in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, &startq;Judge not, that
ye be not judged.&endq; Do not we
$udge and condemn our neighbours,
$ithout hearing what they have to
$ay for them&s;elves? Is not the mo&s;t
$f our conver&s;ation taken up in cen|$ring
and blaming, and putting hard
$on&s;tructions upon every body's ac|$ons?
And as we cen&s;ure others, &s;o
$hey cen&s;ure us.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, &startq;Who&s;oever
&s;hall &s;ay to his brother, Thou fool&punc;
&s;hall be in danger of hell-fire.&endq;
<PB N="48" REF="55">
Are not our expre&s;&s;ions very often
full of in&s;olence and contempt? And
they would be &s;o more frequently, if
we were not afraid of wor&s;e treatment
from others; for the danger of hell
is little minded.</P>
<P>Not only the &s;ermon on the mount
&s;hould be con&s;idered, but the whole
&s;train of our Saviour's doctrine, with
which we may compare our own be|haviour.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> bids us &startq;be humble:&endq;
Are not we extravagantly proud?
He bids us &startq;take the lowe&s;t place:&endq;
Are we not &s;till aiming at the high|e&s;t?
He bids us &startq;be meek:&endq; Art
we not &s;tubborn and pa&s;&s;ionate? At
the &s;ame rate, we may go through all
our Saviour's in&s;truction$, and the
in&s;tructions of his apo&s;tles, and com|pare
them with the practice of the
profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity at this time.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be &s;aid, that Chri|&s;tians
have been very corrupt at all
times. The thing is too true: even
in the apo&s;tles days there were cor|ruptions
both in doctrine and prac|tice:
<PB N="49" REF="56">
pride gives ri&s;e to contentions
and here&s;ies. But after the per&s;ecu|tions
cea&s;ed, the corruptions grew
exce&s;&s;ive: when the church was in
riches and &s;plendor, a door was o|pened
to competition and envy; and
luxury increa&s;ed among all ranks.</P>
<P>To preach up poverty, and live in
$omp, is very un&s;uitable. But let
$he doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be followed, and
$ot the manners of men; and let
$ho&s;e who blame others in different
&s;tations con&s;ider in their con&s;ciences,
$f they would not do the &s;ame things,
were they in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.
And let it be con&s;idered in general,
that the great decay of Chri&s;tianity is
chiefly owing to the neglect of that
great duty of &s;elf-denial.</P>

&s;elves if we would be the di&s;ciples of

<P>Faith is indeed &s;uppo&s;ed to go be|fore

<P>We mu&s;t pray al&s;o that we may be
a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the great work of &s;elf-de|nial.
If we continue to indulge our|&s;elves
in things wherein we know we
ought to deny our&s;elves, our prayers
cannot be heard upon any account;

<P>We mu&s;t con&s;ider with our own

which St <HI>Paul</HI> numbereth among the
abominable works of the fle&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="58">
But &s;elf-denial in things that are
not &s;o gro&s;s is almo&s;t quite forgot. It
is &s;elf-denial to re&s;train a pa&s;&s;ionate

gratifies our own vanity, or our
neighbours, though we are not &s;o

<P>Self-denial would &s;uppre&s;s all the&s;e
fooli&s;h and wicked motions, or at
<PB N="52" REF="59">
lea&s;t weaken them: for we mu&s;t re|member,
that all &s;ins come from the

the hand that kills is not to blame,
for the &s;ame hand may give alms; as
the &s;ame tongue that <HI>cur&s;es</HI> may <HI>ble&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>If we could get the length of &s;elf|denial,
the mo&s;t of <HI>our</HI> work would
be done, and God would do the re&s;t:
&s;omething we mu&s;t do; our con|&s;cience
tells us &s;o; &startq;but it is God who
worketh in us both to will and to do.&endq;
The &s;un &s;hines fir&s;t, but we mu&s;t open
our eyes to &s;ee the light: we mu&s;t
own that the very power of opening
our eyes is from God; but we dare
not &s;ay that he refu&s;es us this power.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t re&s;ign our&s;elves, or give
up our will and all we have to God&punc;
and if we do this heartily, we &s;hall
&s;oon be led to all the acts of &s;elf-de|nial
that are fit for us.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t acknowledge, to the ho|nour

God, who hath no plea&s;ure in the

death of a &s;inner, hath none in any
affliction or unea&s;ine&s;s. To deny

<P>We are &s;urrounded with tempta|tions
of all kinds; we mu&s;t therefore
keep a continual watch over our
actions, our words, and our very
thoughts. All this is &s;elf-denial; for
we are forward and prone to all evil
and folly: we can hardly be in a
place where drink is going, without
being drunk; we can hardly open our
mouth to &s;peak, without &s;peaking
unfavourably of our neighbours, or
too favourably of our&s;elves; if not
&s;ounding our own prai&s;es directly, at
<PB N="54" REF="61">
lea&s;t falling upon contrivances to make
others prai&s;e us.</P>
<P>It were endle&s;s to mention all our
defects, and con&s;equently all the acts
of &s;elf-denial which we &s;hould prac|ti&s;e
upon every occa&s;ion. We mu&s;t
examine our&s;elves, and &s;ee what vices
we are mo&s;t inclined to, or &startq;the
weights which &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et us,&endq;
as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, and pray to God
that he may remove them.</P>
<P>There is one thing always to $e
kept in mind, that if we do not deny
our&s;elves, by checking the fi$&s;t mo|tions
of vice, they grow too &s;trong
for us to re&s;i&s;t, and one vicious act
makes way for another, till at la&s;t
there is a &s;ettled habit, and we are
tied and bound with chains of our
own making. Let us con&s;ider this
carefully, from the melancholy in|&s;tances
we may have felt in our&s;elves,
and heard of in others.</P>
<P>Here &s;omewhat ought to be &s;aid
concerning the cro&s;s, as being the
particular badge of Chri&s;tianity. Our
Saviour bids us &startq;take up our cro&s;s:&endq;
<PB N="55" REF="62">
for it is laid upon all men, and the
taking it up implieth a chearful &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to it.</P>
<P>The cro&s;s mu&s;t be bitter to us, or
it would be no cro&s;s; and God, who
knoweth be&s;t what is nece&s;&s;ary for
our cure, layeth &s;uch cro&s;&s;es upon us
as his divine wi&s;dom &s;ees &s;it for that
purpo&s;e. There are cro&s;&s;es to bear
every hour of the day; whatever
contradicts our humour is a cro&s;s,
whether the contradiction is rea&s;on|able
or not. Different tempers mu&s;t
cro&s;s $nd mortify one another, which
doth good on both &s;ides: even well-intentioned
people may crucify one
another, through their remains of
imperfection; and their reflecting af|terwards
upon their error is a new
cro&s;s to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Bodily pain, and lo&s;s of goods and
reputation, are cro&s;&s;es that God lays
upon us. Per&s;ons advanced in the
&s;piritual life &s;peak of cro&s;&s;es laid on
more immediately by his divine hand,
which are &s;till harder to bear, as tend|ing
to a more inward purification.</P>

<P>Equity, or ju&s;tice, in the highe&s;t &s;ig|nification,
implies all the duties we

him, becau&s;e he is infinitely lovely
and prai&s;e-worthy. But we &s;hall fir&s;t
con&s;ider ju&s;tice only as it relates to
men.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour gives us the
mea&s;ure or &s;tandard of ju&s;tice or e|quity:
&startq;Therefore all things what|&s;oever
<PB N="57" REF="64">
ye would that men &s;hould do

It is all that is required in
the law and the prophets, with regard
to our neighbour. The love of God
is indeed the &startq;fulfilling of the law;&endq;
but if &startq;we do not love our neigh|bour
whom we have &s;een, we can|not
love God, whom we have not
&s;een.&endq; So the apo&s;tle tells us. And
it is remarkable, that the words of the
&s;cripture have a plainne&s;s and force in
them, which men very often ob&s;cure
and weaken by their explications.</P>
<P>The happy effects of ju&s;tice may
be imagined, by con&s;idering the un|happy
effects of inju&s;tice. The earth
is covered with war and blood&s;hed;
groans and tears are the effects of in|ju&s;tice,
even in private per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice implies compa&s;&s;ion. We
are naturally dear to our&s;elves. If
we were ju&s;t, our neighbours would
be dear to us in like manner.</P>
<P>It is but a poor kind of ju&s;tice that
only ab&s;tains from doing injury. We

de&s;erve the name of compa&s;&s;ion, to

grievous to the &s;ufferers! A bitter
word, a contemptuous look, with
many other in&s;tances of ill humour,

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Charity.</HEAD>
<P>THis divine virtue often pa&s;&s;eth on|ly
for <HI>giving of alms,</HI> or any good
that is done to men: but what St
<HI>Paul</HI> under&s;tands chiefly by it is the
love of God. The word <HI>charity</HI> &s;ig|nifies
<PB N="61" REF="68">
<HI>love;</HI> and this divine virtue is
the chief and mother of all virtues;
it implies the pure&s;t adoration of the
&s;upreme being, and the fulle&s;t &s;urren|der
of all the powers of our &s;oul: in
&s;hort it may be called a principle re|gulating
all our actions and motions.
To be convinced of the apo&s;tle's
meaning, we need but look at the de|&s;cription
and the marks he gives of it
to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> &startq;Though I &s;peak
with the tongues of men and an|gels,
and have not charity, I am
become as &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a
tinkling cymbal. And though I
have all faith, &s;o that I could re|move
mountains, and have not cha|rity,
I am nothing<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii.</NOTE>.&endq; The love of
our neighbour is certainly included in
the apo&s;tle's de&s;cription; for &startq;cha|rity
is kind.&endq;</P>
<P>Let the whole chapter be read.
The apo&s;tle proceeds to give the
marks of charity, which cannot agree
&s;o well to any thing as to the love of
God, though there are things in the
<PB N="62" REF="69">
de&s;cription of it that agree likewi&s;e to
the love of our neighbour: but cha|rity
is &startq;that which is perfect.&endq; And
the apo&s;tle concludes, &startq;And now a|bideth
faith, hope, charity, the&s;e
three; but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is
charity.&endq;</P>
<P>Rea&s;on it&s;elf may teach us that the
love of God is the greate&s;t of all du|ties,
and that they mu&s;t all be com|prehended
in it. In our imperfect
love of any per&s;on, we do all we can
to plea&s;e and &s;hew our e&s;teem, and
are ready to obey all the commands
and to do the will of the beloved per|&s;on.
How much more rea&s;onable is
it to do the will of our ble&s;&s;ed Maker,
and &startq;to love him with our whole
heart, &s;trength, and mind!&endq; He
is the fountain of all goodne&s;s and
beauty: we would love him for
his own excellencies, if our hearts
were in good order; and all we can
do in the mean time is to give up our
hearts wholly to him, that he may
clean&s;e and purify them, and enlight|en
<PB N="63" REF="70">
our minds, that we may &s;ee his
divine perfections in the true light.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t pray for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
and grace of God, that we may be
enabled to do what we cannot do by
nature, or of our&s;elves. We mu&s;t
pray, that he would root out every
thing in us that hinders us from lo|ving
him with all the powers and fa|culties
of our &s;oul.</P>
<P>We have no notion of the deep
corruption that hinders us from lo|ving
God: &startq;We cannot &s;erve two
ma&s;ters;&endq; we love the world, and
the things in it, and the&s;e chiefly for
the love we bear to our&s;elves: &s;o that
it is this hateful <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> or &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s,
that makes us forget God, and
care for nothing but what plea&s;es us
for the pre&s;ent time, or &s;erves our
pre&s;ent intere&s;t, or rather our hu|mour;
for our friends become our
enemies, how &s;oon they cro&s;s our in|clinations,
even though they do it for
our good.</P>
<P>Thus are we blinded by <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI>
which is the idol we &s;et up in the
<PB N="64" REF="71">
place of God. The Heathens, who
wor&s;hip &s;tocks and &s;tones ignorantly,
are not &s;o much to blame, as we who
wor&s;hip our&s;elves, and would have
every body fall down before us.</P>
<P>But it is only the power of God
that can break this idol to pieces. It
is not in our power to free our&s;elves
of our arrogance and folly. Any
good thing we do is ready to make us
value our&s;elves upon it, and &s;o we
grow more proud. If we do not
<HI>give alms</HI> with a de&s;ign <HI>that we may
be &s;een of men,</HI> at lea&s;t the reflection
is apt to come in our heads that men
will prai&s;e us, and we have often too
much complacency in that reflection.</P>
<P>But often we perform our poor
works with an expre&s;s intention that
men may prai&s;e us; and we endea|vour
to come off as cheap as we can:
Going to church is but a &s;mall mat|ter;
and we can meet with an ac|quaintance
at the &s;ame time, or &s;hew
our be&s;t cloaths; and this we would
have pa&s;s for devotion.</P>
<P>I am far from di&s;paraging any reli|gious
<PB N="65" REF="72">
ob&s;ervance; we have need of
many things to &s;tir up our dull
minds: but I wi&s;h people would exa|mine
them&s;elves upon the motives of
their actions, and &s;ee whether they
are done for God's glory or their
own.</P>
<P>What are we that we &s;hould rob
God of his glory? <HI>Du&s;t and a&s;hes</HI> and
&s;in. We may &s;ee the rea&s;onablene&s;s
of &s;elf-denial, though our Saviour
had not recommended it: it is ju&s;t
with re&s;pect to God, and nece&s;&s;ary
upon our own account; for we mu&s;t
a&s;cend to the love of God by tho&s;e
&s;teps of prayer, &s;elf-denial, and all
the other duties of religion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay again, that common
rea&s;on is enough to &s;hew us, that
God's glory ought to be the aim of
all our actions; and that we ought to
love him above all things, &s;ince he is
the mo&s;t perfect of all beings, and
the author of all that is good; and
that our heart mu&s;t love &s;omething,
and is only happy in loving what can
&s;atisfy it, which created things can
<PB N="66" REF="73">
never do. All this, I &s;ay, rea&s;on
may teach us imperfectly, but it is
only the divine light that can teach us
perfectly, and only the divine power
that can draw us out of our <HI>corrup|tion</HI>
and <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> which are but two

this point, not con&s;idering that con|ver&s;ion

of plea&s;ure to the love of God, from
the fle&s;h to the &s;pirit, from unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s

makes us acceptable to him.</P>
<P>It is indeed a comfort to think we

enter in at the &s;trait gate,&endq; and to
walk as our Redeemer hath directed

<P>We flatter our&s;elves, if we think

Let us examine our con|&s;ciences,

agrees with that of our ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>What can po&s;&s;e&s;s us to think we
are <HI>reformed</HI> and <HI>converted,</HI> when we

is too good to impo&s;e upon us; it
were bla&s;phemy to think it; if the
devil deceiveth us, it &s;eems we are
willing to be deceived; and &s;o upon
the matter we deceive our&s;elves. The
devil may tempt us, but he cannot
<PB N="68" REF="75">
force our will; nor can he &s;o delude
our under&s;tanding, as to make us
take vice for virtue. God hath not
given our adver&s;ary &s;uch ab&s;olute
power over any of our faculties.</P>
<P>But we are at no pains to re&s;i&s;t the
devil, nor our own corrupt inclina|tions;
and our pride makes us throw
the blame of our mi&s;deeds any where

when we &s;hould not; yea, we are
&s;o void of &s;hame and piety, as &s;ome|times

<P>Let us not deceive our&s;elves, by

&startq;be renewed in the &s;pirit of our

more <HI>conver&s;ion</HI> nor <HI>reformation,</HI> than
the going from one town to another.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ion is the drawing near to
God with the heart. He complain|ed

when their heart was far from

<P>I beg leave to make a di&s;tinction be|twixt

&s;tate wherein &startq;we live no more,&endq;

<P>True conver&s;ion may be &s;aid to
happen, when our hearts are touch|ed
with a &s;incere de&s;ire of for&s;aking
our own will, in order to do the will
of our heavenly Father. This may
be called real, or true conver&s;ion;
for the bare change from one out|ward
form to another is but a fal&s;e or

with many imperfections. A man
may have a right view of the end of
his journey, or the place where he
&s;hould arrive at, as al&s;o of the place

may have a hearty de&s;ire to leave the
one, and to reach the other:</P>
<P>I &s;ay, we may begin our journey

with a very &s;incere intention;
but then we may be very often intan|gled
with the things of this mi&s;erable

plea&s;ing men, and the &s;illy fear of
what they may &s;ay. We may be like|wi&s;e
hindered by our own violent
pa&s;&s;ions, which may &s;top our journey
like &s;torms of wind or rain. We

good purpo&s;e! It is a kind of &s;tock
put in our hands to purcha&s;e eternal
happine&s;s; and if we &s;quander it a|way,
we lo&s;e that happine&s;s, and fall
into un&s;peakable mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Sleep, and other nece&s;&s;ities of our
frail bodies, mu&s;t take away a great
part of our time from us: but for
this we are not accountable&punc; if we do
not wa&s;te too much of it in relieving
tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities, or rather indulging
our plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o labour in our &s;everal
<PB N="73" REF="80">
employments, by which much time is
cut off from the &s;ervice of God; but
it cannot be called lo&s;t time, &s;ince
work and labour is of his appoint|ment.
And what a happine&s;s this is
for mankind, every body knows:
They who have little to do, are often
more unhappy than tho&s;e who gain
their living by the &s;weat of their
brow.</P>
<P>As it is idlene&s;s that makes people
fall upon fooli&s;h amu&s;ements and di|ver&s;ions,
to pa&s;s away the time which
hangs &s;o heavy upon their hands, it
were very rea&s;onable for them to
think how they might pa&s;s it better;
&s;ince if they ever reflect e&s;pecially
on a dying bed, it will be very grie|vous
to them that they have &s;pent
their precious time &s;o fooli&s;hly and
unworthily. How will it torture
them to look back upon their gaming
and drinking, their ob&s;cene di&s;cour&s;e,
their common way of cen&s;uring their
neighbours, in a word, all their tri|fling
and &s;inful practices!</P>
<P>I &s;hall not condemn every thing
<PB N="74" REF="81">
that is called diver&s;ion; a game at
cards is better than drinking, or
&s;peaking ill without drinking. A
man's own con&s;cience and good ad|vice
mu&s;t direct him for the be&s;t, or
the lea&s;t evil, in &s;uch ca&s;es; for it is
to be acknowledged, that both body
and mind have need of &s;ome relaxa|tion.</P>
<P>The great body of mankind mu&s;t
work hard for their bread; it were
good if they could mix &s;ome good
thoughts with their labour; which
they might do if they were wi&s;e, and
it would very much &s;weeten their toil.
They might meditate in the field up|on
God's goodne&s;s; pious reflections
might ri&s;e when they plough and
&s;ow; and in their hou&s;es they might
have many occa&s;ions of lifting up
their hearts to God in &s;hort prayers
and prai&s;es, without any body's know|ing
what pa&s;&s;ed in their minds.</P>
<P>Such &s;ecret devotions, or whatever
they may be 'called, might be per|formed
by all ranks: but they mu&s;t
pa&s;s very unob&s;ervedly, otherwi&s;e
<PB N="75" REF="82">
pride might mingle with them, and
the company would look upon it as
dreaming, or perhaps madne&s;s.</P>
<P>But we are not only to endeavour
to &s;pend our time well for our own
improvement in devotion; we mu&s;t
likewi&s;e endeavour to &s;pend it for our
neighbour's good; and &s;o we mu&s;t
&s;eek all occa&s;ions of relieving the
poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed that properly fall
to our &s;hare, for prudence mu&s;t &s;till
go along; at lea&s;t we mu&s;t omit no
occa&s;ion that offereth to us of doing
good any manner of way, either by
money, or any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t neither forget our neigh|bours
nor our&s;elves. We mu&s;t not
turn. &startq;keepers of others vineyards,
and neglect our own.&endq; The con|&s;tant
intention of plea&s;ing God would
lead us right in every thing.</P>
<P>That happy intention is the <HI>walking
before God.</HI> If we con&s;ider our&s;elves
as &s;till in his pre&s;ence, (which un|doubtedly
we are), we &s;hall employ
our whole time in doing what we
<PB N="76" REF="83">
ought; though &s;till we mu&s;t look up|on
our&s;elves as unprofitable &s;ervants.</P>
<P>One very happy way of pa&s;&s;ing time
is in good conver&s;ation; nor can any
thing be more agreeable. But here I
&s;uppo&s;e there is familiarity, el&s;e the
di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t only be upon common
things: every one is on his guard,
and afraid to talk of religion, le&s;t it
&s;hould be thought <HI>cant;</HI> which in|deed
is very much to be &s;hunned.</P>
<P>But when true friends meet toge|ther,
who have a reli&s;h for pious con|ver&s;ation,
they may be very u&s;eful to
one another; and they ought to lay
a&s;ide re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Religious a&s;&s;emblies, public and
private prayers, good meditations
when alone or in company, (for the
mind is &s;till going upon &s;omewhat),
all the&s;e things are very good for em|ploying
the time.</P>
<P>Reading books of in&s;truction is

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Exhortation to the Study of the
Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>WHat pity is it that &s;uch a pre&s;ent
from heaven &s;hould be &s;o
&s;hamefully neglected! The &s;criptures
are the word of God, and the mani|fe&s;tation
of his will to the children of
men: How carefully ought we to &s;tu|dy
them, both from our intere&s;t and
our duty! What &s;tudy could be &s;o
plea&s;ant, if we had any ta&s;te? The
writings of the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment
excel all other writings, in the
plainne&s;s and noblene&s;s of the &s;tyle,
be&s;ide the greatne&s;s of the truths they
di&s;cover. How important are the&s;e
truths, on which our happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery
depend for ever! Yet God
&s;peaketh, and men will not hear!
&startq;Fools hate in&s;truction. We love
darkne&s;s better than light, becau&s;e
our deeds are evil.&endq;</P>
<P>A little was &s;aid before concerning
<PB N="78" REF="85">
the truths which holy writ teacheth
us. It &s;hews us what man was once;
what we are now, through the fault
of our fir&s;t parents; and what we
may be through the merits of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, if our own fault is not a hin|derance.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Berea</HI> are commend|ed
in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, for
their diligence in &s;earching the &s;crip|tures:
and they had only the books of
the Old Te&s;tament in their hands.
Much more ought the &s;criptures to
be &s;tudied now, &s;ince the books of
the New Te&s;tament are added.</P>
<P>Both Te&s;tament may be compared
together. Our Saviour's coming in|to
the world, and all his miracles and
&s;ufferings, are prophe&s;ied in the Old
Te&s;tament; and he appealeth to it in
his arguing with the <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;ome of
whom believed in him, and others re|jected
him, becau&s;e they expected a
deliverer who &s;hould make them
great in this world. Temporal great|ne&s;s
is a bewitching thing.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the <HI>Jews</HI> at this time
<PB N="79" REF="86">
is melancholy: it was foretold al&s;o;
and there are many prophecies con|cerning
their conver&s;ion. It will &s;till
come: &startq;A thou&s;and years in God's
&s;ight are but as one day.&endq;</P>
<P>The Old Te&s;tament contains the hi|&s;tory
of that remarkable nation. It
begins indeed with the hi&s;tory of the
world. What &s;trange events! The
<HI>creation,</HI> the <HI>fall,</HI> the <HI>flood,</HI> the <HI>Red
&s;ea,</HI> the <HI>law,</HI> the <HI>promi&s;ed land;</HI> in a
word, all the extraordinary affairs of
that people, from <HI>Abraham</HI> to the
captivity, and &s;ome things which be|fel
them from that time to the birth
of our Saviour, including two and
forty generations, as St <HI>Matthew</HI> in|formeth
us.</P>
<P>The New Te&s;tament contains our
Saviour's life, his doctrine and mi|racles,
his &s;ufferings and death, his
re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion; the be|ginnings
of the Chri&s;tian church, the
labours and miracles of the apo&s;tles,
their in&s;truction to the faithful in
their epi&s;tles; and, la&s;tly, the revela|tion
of St <HI>John;</HI> for the true explica|tion
<PB N="80" REF="87">
of which men mu&s;t wait till God's
appointed time.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, that in
the books of both Te&s;taments there
are more meanings than the literal.
St <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s two
&s;ons, the one by <HI>Sarah,</HI> and the other
by the <HI>bond-woman,</HI> addeth, &startq;Which
things are an allegory.&endq;</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e figures are appli|cable
to the next world, which is call|ed
the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem:</HI> others of
them are applicable to the &s;piritual
&s;tate of the &s;oul; as outward circum|ci&s;ion
is a figure of the circumci&s;ion
of the heart; the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> a figure
of our unlawful de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions;
with a thou&s;and things be&s;ides, which
have a relation to moral actions, and
the inward life, though the outward
literal meaning is never to be laid a|&s;ide,
unle&s;s the expre&s;&s;ions are only
figurative, as when God is &s;aid to
have hands and feet, anger, deri&s;ion,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let this be con&s;idered, and per|haps
it will not be found a bad key
for under&s;tanding &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of
<PB N="81" REF="88">
holy writ, which would be of great
u&s;e for the true reformation of our
lives.</P>
<P>When one con&s;iders all the beau|ties
and advantages of the&s;e &s;acred
books, the hi&s;torical part, the reli|gious
ordinances, (even under the
law), the pure doctrine, the well-at|te&s;ted
miracles, the fine compo&s;itions
of poetry, the prophecies, and their
accompli&s;hment, and above all, the
life and offices of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeem|er;
I &s;ay, when one con&s;iders all
the&s;e things, he mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed at
the impicity of de&s;pi&s;ing and ridicu|ling
what is &s;o divine in it&s;elf, and ad|vantageous
to mortals!</P>
<P>But &s;uch &s;trange &s;pirits there are;
though perhaps they are led by a &s;pi|rit
more cunning than their own,
who&s;e intere&s;t they are carrying on
without any expre&s;s covenant with
him.</P>
<P>Whatever may be of that, it is a|mong
the higher ranks that &s;uch im|piety
is mo&s;t heard of: the great bo|dy
of the people have a re&s;pect for
<PB N="82" REF="89">
the word of God; they have le&s;s
pride, and &s;ounder judgment, than
the &startq;&s;coffers, who walk after their
own lu&s;ts,&endq; as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;|eth
it.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be own|ed,
that the great body of the people
are very ignorant of the de&s;ign and
meaning of the &s;criptures in many
ca&s;es. It is pity to &s;ee how they fall
to work with the Bible: they take it
up at random, and &s;ometimes read a
pa&s;&s;age of the Levitical law with the
&s;ame grave tone as if it were a part of
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;ermon on the mount.</P>
<P>In this point the judgment of the
people is not to be made &s;peeches on;
but it proceeds much from inadver|tency:
and &s;ince their intention is
good, any little endeavours for their
better information ought chearfully to
be given, expecting from the Holy
Spirit alone the fruit of any endea|vours,
and true light only from that
Spirit both to others and our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have often thought it would not
be an ill method for tho&s;e who have
<PB N="83" REF="90">
Bibles, and can write, to make &s;ome
extracts out of them concerning the
mo&s;t remarkable vices and virtues.
For example, to take pride, and &s;o
collect &s;ome texts concerning the dan|ger
and abomination of it. Some|times
the &s;ame ver&s;e will contain both
the vice, and the virtue oppo&s;ite to it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is &s;omewhat of this kind done by Dr Ga&s;trel; but it need not hinder people from making extracts for them&s;elves, provided they can make them with di&s;cretion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to pride: &startq;When pride co|meth,
then cometh &s;hame.&endq; &startq;Pride
goeth before de&s;truction.&endq; &startq;A
man's pride &s;hall bring him low.&endq;
&startq;Only by pride cometh contention.&endq;
&startq;Wo to the crown of pride.&endq; &startq;A
proud heart will not I &s;uffer.&endq;
&startq;Though the Lord be high, yet
hath he re&s;pect to the lowly, but
the proud he knoweth afar off.&endq;
&startq;For God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and
giveth grace to the humble.&endq; St
<HI>Peter</HI> had &s;aid immediately before,
&startq;Be ye all &s;ubject one to another,
and clothed with humility.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="91">
The like extracts might be made
upon other &s;ubjects; again&s;t lying
and deceit, again&s;t gluttony and
drunkenne&s;s, again&s;t &s;loth, again&s;t
anger, again&s;t hypocri&s;y, again&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ion,
again&s;t evil-&s;peaking of all
kinds; in &s;hort, again&s;t every thing
that is offen&s;ive to religion and good
manners.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Canaanites</HI> were driven
out of the Holy Land before the chil|dren
of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, &s;o
vices are rooted out of the &s;oul before
the planting of virtues. And the like
extracts might be made as to the&s;e:</P>
<P>On righteou&s;ne&s;s, on temperance,
on mercifulne&s;s, on the fear and love
of God; which la&s;t is all in all.</P>
<P>Extracts might al&s;o be made con|cerning
the mi&s;eries of the pre&s;ent
life, and the hopes of a better: on
death and judgment; or any &s;ubject

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Nece&s;&s;ity of Di&s;cretion, Watchful|ne&s;s,
and Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion of a former chap|ter
&s;ugge&s;ted a reflection, that in
practi&s;ing certain virtues, and &s;hun|ning
certain vices, we $word$ &s;ome ha|zard
of falling into extremes: for the
common &s;aying is here very true&punc;
That virtue lieth in the middle.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome vices &s;o ab&s;olutely
wicked and ba&s;e, that we cannot keep
at too great a di&s;tance from them;
&s;uch as pride, envy, malice, and ma|ny
more. There are &s;ome virtues &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary and charming, that we can
never have too much of them; &s;uch
as &s;incerity, humility, and the like.</P>
<P>There are le&s;&s;er virtues, &s;uch as li|berality,
that mu&s;t be practi&s;ed with
di&s;cretion: for if a man &s;hould give
too much to one that happened to
a&s;k fir&s;t, he might put him&s;elf out of
a capacity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting another per&s;on
<PB N="86" REF="93">
of more worth and nece&s;&s;ity, that
might come afterwards. Indeed our
ble&s;&s;ed Saviour bids us in general
&startq;Give to him that a&s;keth; and from
him that would borrow, not to
turn away.&endq; His divine wi&s;dom
did not &s;ee it nece&s;&s;ary to make any
re&s;trictions, &s;ince nature is too ready
to &s;eek excu&s;es and di&s;pen&s;ations from
its duty.</P>
<P>But we are not &s;o ready to err up|on
the <HI>giving &s;ide;</HI> only we are to
guard again&s;t too much ea&s;ine&s;s of
temper, which would make us a prey
to every importunate, or every unju&s;t
per&s;on.</P>
<P>Di&s;cretion mu&s;t go along with our
actions; the prudence of the &s;erpent
mu&s;t be joined with the &s;implicity of
the dove: our Lord him&s;elf recom|mends
it, and often bids us &startq;beware
of men.&endq;</P>
<P>Nor is it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould
<HI>beware of our&s;elves,</HI> &s;ince we are our
own greate&s;t enemies; for which rea|&s;on,
the duty of &s;elf-examination is
often recommended: but then we
<PB N="87" REF="94">
mu&s;t take care not to go to an exce&s;s
in making too many reflections upon
our own conduct; which would make
us fall into fooli&s;h &s;cruples, and put
a &s;top to all good actions; it might
even turn our heads, and make us
di&s;tru&s;t the mercy of God. I grant
the &s;crupulous &s;tate is not &s;o ordinary
as carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and impiety: but all ex|tremes
are to be &s;hunned.</P>
<P>It is certain that vices can never
turn virtues; but there are virtues
that may turn vices, by pu&s;hing them
too far. Chearfulne&s;s is a virtue;
but when it pa&s;&s;es certain bounds, it is
folly and in&s;olence.</P>
<P>Diligence is a virtue; but it may
turn to hurry, precipitation, and an|xiety
of mind. Reproof is a virtue;
but it may turn to chiding and &s;cold|ing.</P>
<P>Thus many good things may dege|nerate:
frugality may become &s;or|did;
decent living, fanta&s;tical. We
may be too coar&s;e, or too fine, in our
apparel; too na&s;ty, or too nice: in
<PB N="88" REF="95">
our behaviour, too formal, or too
rough.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;till guard again&s;t doing
too little or too much. <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;peaks
of an exce&s;s in righteou&s;ne&s;s it&s;elf.
We mu&s;t not expect too much from
imperfect creatures: and there are
&s;everal things which di&s;cretion mu&s;t
make us wink at. It is very true,
our Saviour bids us &startq;fulfil all righ|teou&s;ne&s;s:&endq;
but moderation, and
bearing with one another, is a part of
righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o that <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;eems
only to have cautioned again&s;t too ri|gid
exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>But who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e
things? We are &s;urrounded with
dangers upon all &s;ides: if we e&s;cape
<HI>rocks,</HI> we are ready to fall into <HI>quick
&s;ands.</HI> We have bad example with|out
us; and within we have our own
pa&s;&s;ions, and pride, that &s;till aims to
be admired in every thing we do or
omit.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore be con&s;tantly
upon the watch, according to our
<PB N="89" REF="96">
Saviour's direction; for we are pla|ced
<HI>between fire and water.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t watch, and u&s;e our ut|mo&s;t
endeavours in every thing; but
at the &s;ame time we mu&s;t remember,
with <HI>David,</HI> that &startq;except the Lord
keep the city, the watchman wa|keth
but in vain.&endq; Without his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance and grace, our prudence is
but <HI>folly,</HI> and our be&s;t actions <HI>&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;hews clearly the nece&s;&s;ity of
prayer. We can never reflect enough
on our pa&s;&s;ions, our frailty, and our
incon&s;tancy: we have the pa&s;&s;ion
and folly <HI>of the day</HI> to &s;truggle with;
we are not the &s;ame per&s;ons in the
forenoon and afternoon; we com|plain
of being engaged with madmen,
and forget that we are mad our&s;elves.</P>
<P>How many things have we to pray
for! how many things to pray a|gain&s;t!
The choice ought certainly
to be referred to the &startq;fountain of all
wi&s;dom, that knoweth our nece&s;&s;ities
before we a&s;k, and our ignorance in
a&s;king.&endq; This &s;ome of the wi&s;er
Heathens were &s;en&s;ible of.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="97">
Somewhat was &s;aid on prayer be|fore;

thing.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;ay, that we mu&s;t be al|ways
on our knees when we pray:
the offering up the heart, in whatever
po&s;ture, is true prayer: and though
our attention mu&s;t frequently be
drawn off from God, becau&s;e of the
things we are nece&s;&s;arily employed in;
yet our heart may be in &s;uch a fixed

but by accident; or even any actions,
proceeding from &s;uch a frame of

the glory of God,&endq; as St <HI>Paul</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;eth

Our thoughts are ordinarily
&s;cattered and di&s;tracted with an infi|nite

would free us of a world of trouble,
created by our wandering imagina|tions,

<P>This &s;tate may be termed continual
prayer; it doth not hinder proper
action, but rather makes it more vi|gorous,

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Difference between the Jewi&s;h
Religion and the Chri&s;tian.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e two religions can only be
compared together properly, or
with fitne&s;s; becau&s;e they only are of
divine in&s;titution, and outwardly re|vealed
from heaven. The Heathen
wor&s;hip was unhappy, as being the
inventions of corrupt men; and pro|bably
<PB N="93" REF="100">
with great mixture from the
powers of darkne&s;s; their rites and
ceremonies were &s;o &s;tupid, &s;o impure,
&s;o cruel.</P>
<P><HI>Ma$omet</HI>'s revelations were but pre|tended;
&s;o the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> religion is a
ma&s;s of wild fictions, an ab&s;urd mix|ture
of <HI>Pagani&s;in, Judai&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Chri|&s;tianity.</HI>
Many parts of the earth
are &s;till over-run with gro&s;s idolatry of
various &s;orts.</P>
<P>Before the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> religion, we hear of no out|ward
in&s;titutions from God. Sacrifi|ces
indeed were in u&s;e &s;ince the begin|ning
of the world, as we &s;ee in the
in&s;tance of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel.</HI> But du|ring
all the time before the flood,
and after it, till the giving of the law
from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> mankind were left
to the natural dictates of con&s;cience,
or what is called <HI>natural religion,</HI> and
&s;ometimes <HI>the patriarchal di&s;pen&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>Before the &s;tood the &s;cripture tells
us of &s;ome few men who lived plain,
inoffen&s;ive, religious lives, as having
God before their eyes in all their ac|tions.
<PB N="94" REF="101">
It is &s;aid particularly of <HI>Enoch,</HI>
that he walked with God, as was ob|&s;erved
before. But as mankind mul|tiplied,
they became more corrupt,
&startq;and the earth was filled with vio|lence;&endq;
which brought upon them
the judgment of the flood.</P>
<P>The righteous <HI>Noah,</HI> (who was
&s;aved with his family), continued to
give a good example, except once that
we hear he was <HI>drunken.</HI> But the earth
being again over&s;pread with di&s;orders
and abominations, it plea&s;ed God to
call <HI>Abraham</HI> from his country, and
to in&s;titute circumci&s;ion: he wor&s;hip|ped
the true God, and his de&s;cendents
continued in his religion till the law
of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was given; at which period
ended the <HI>patriarchal</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Now, for under&s;tanding the differ|ence
between the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
religions, together with the value of
each, it will be of great u&s;e to con&s;i|der
attentively tho&s;e two great e|pi&s;tles,
to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the <HI>He|brews.</HI>
But we mu&s;t under&s;tand be|forehand,
that the true <HI>Jews</HI> and
<PB N="95" REF="102">
the true <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had but one e&s;&s;en|tial
religion, which con&s;i&s;ted in the
love of God and our neighbour: for,
as St <HI>Paul</HI> hath &s;aid, &startq;He is not a
<HI>Jew,</HI> who is one outwardly; nei|ther
is that circumci&s;ion, which is
outwardly in the fle&s;h,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This
agrees with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s words to the <HI>Jews,
(Deut.</HI> x.) &startq;Circumci&s;e, therefore,
the fore&s;kin of your heart, and be
no more &s;tiff-necked,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He
had &s;aid before, &startq;Thou &s;halt love the
Lord thy God with all thine heart,&endq;
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our Saviour confirms the matter,
when he &s;aid to the doctor of the law
that tempted him, &startq;Thou &s;halt love
the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and
with all thy mind, and with all thy
&s;trength. This is the fir&s;t and great
commandment. And the &s;econd is
like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy
neighbour as thy&s;elf. On the&s;e two
commandments hang all the law and
the prophets.&endq; We &s;ee then that love
is the end of the law, and that <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had but one religion.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="103">
In the two epi&s;tles above mention|ed,
the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gets its due, but
the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is preferred, both for its
greater efficacy, and the higher cha|racter
of its lawgiver. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is
not only exalted above <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> but a|bove
the angels: for when it is &s;aid,
&startq;He was made a little lower than
the angels<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 7.</NOTE>,&endq; it is to be under&s;tood
as he was man; for he is &startq;heir of
all things, and maker of the
worlds.&endq; He &s;ays of him&s;elf, &startq;The
Father and I are one;&endq; and St&punc; <HI>John</HI>
thus begins his go&s;pel, &startq;In the be|ginning
was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the
Word was God.&endq;</P>
<P>Of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> it is &s;aid, &startq;He was faith|ful
in all his hou&s;e, as a &s;ervant,
for the te&s;timony of tho&s;e things
which were to be &s;poken after:&endq;
but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &startq;as a Son over his own
hou&s;e,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &startq;He is al&s;o called
the Mediator of a better covenant,
which was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon better
promi&s;es.&endq; Much more is to be
<PB N="97" REF="104">
found in the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> to &s;hew the
in&s;ufficiency of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law in
compari&s;on of the go&s;pel; were it
but this one ver&s;e, (chap. x.) &startq;For
it is impo&s;&s;ible that the blood of
bulls and goats &s;hould take away
&s;ins.&endq;</P>
<P>In the <HI>Romans</HI> the law is &s;ufficient|ly
extolled; but many things are &s;et
down in that epi&s;tle to give the
<HI>Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> the preference.
&startq;There is now no condemnation to
them that are in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI>&endq; it is
added, &startq;to them who walk not after
the fle&s;h, but after the Spirit<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1.</NOTE>;&endq; to
teach us, that the bare profe&s;&s;&s;ion and
form of Chri&s;tianity are not &s;ufficient
to &s;ave us, without the life and power
of it, but will rather make our pu|ni&s;hment
the greater.</P>
<P>Indeed St <HI>Paul</HI>'s great de&s;ign is, to
&s;hew the excelleney of faith above
the works of the law. The <HI>Jews</HI>
prided them&s;elves that the law was
committed to their keeping, and that
they ob&s;erved all the parts of it exact|ly.
<PB N="98" REF="105">
The apo&s;tle undeceives them,
and tells them plainly they were re|jected,
becau&s;e they confided in their
outward ob&s;ervances and privileges,
and de&s;pi&s;ed the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t carefully remember, that
the works of the law &s;eemingly con|demned
by the apo&s;tle, and which
God him&s;elf rejected, when they were
not done from the &s;pirit of religion,
but from vile motives, or &s;uperficial|ly
at be&s;t; (for he &s;ays by the mouth
of a prophet, &startq;Bring no more vain
oblations, incen&s;e is an abomina|tion
unto me<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">If. $. 13.</NOTE>,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI>); I am bold to
&s;ay, the works di&s;regarded by St&punc; <HI>Paul</HI>
were by no means the good works of
humanity and love; for &startq;without
works faith is dead;&endq; as, on the o|ther
hand, without faith no works of
any kind could avail us. What <HI>Je&s;us
Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aid in the ca&s;e of marriage is
applicable here, &startq;What therefore
God hath joined together, let no
man put a&s;under<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xix. 6.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>But once more, as to the difference
<PB N="99" REF="106">
between the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> or
the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation and the <HI>Chri|&s;tian,</HI>
or the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> and the
<HI>New;</HI> we find, that the former di&s;|pen&s;ation
was founded in fear, and
with rigorous ob&s;ervances; whereas
the latter was a di&s;pen&s;ation of love,
and no burden&s;ome ceremonies re|quired.
It is true, we mu&s;t &startq;de|ny
our&s;elves, and take up the
cro&s;s:&endq; we mu&s;t &startq;&s;uffer with
Chri&s;t, if we would reign with
him:&endq; this is properly the doctrine
of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> wherein the
corruption of our nature is more
clearly di&s;covered than in the <HI>Old.</HI>
We may conclude too from rea&s;on,
that the cro&s;s and &s;ufferings are only
laid upon us for our own good, to
clean&s;e us from our impurity, as me|tals
are purified in the fire. The
merciful God hath declared, &startq;He
hath no plea&s;ure in the death of a
&s;inner<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii.</NOTE>;&endq; nor is any cha&s;ti&s;ement
infl$cted, but for leading man back
to his duty; which is a rea&s;on, not
<PB N="100" REF="107">
only for re&s;ignation and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
but for thankfulne&s;s and love.</P>
<P>It is evident that the Chri&s;tian law
is much more a law of love than the
<HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> both with relation to God
and our neighbour. For though the
children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were injoined to
love God with their whole heart, yet
rewards (temporal rewards) were
promi&s;ed, to &s;tir them up to that
great duty; infinite goodne&s;s thus
cone&s;cending to deal with his crea|tures
according to the weakne&s;s and
gro&s;sne&s;s of their &s;tate; &s;ince they
cannot ea&s;ily perceive, that to love
God is the highe&s;t reward of it&s;elf,
and the greate&s;t happine&s;s imaginable,
or rather a happine&s;s beyond all ima|gination.</P>
<P>But as the proper character of the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law was fear, temporal puni&s;h|ments
were al&s;o threatened; which
was another argument of the gro&s;s
&s;tate of the people. <HI>Solomon</HI> indeed
hath &s;aid, &startq;The fear of the Lord is
the beginning of wi&s;dom;&endq; but
&startq;perfect love,&endq; &s;aith St <HI>John,</HI> &startq;ca&s;t|eth
<PB N="101" REF="108">
out fear.&endq; This is not to be
under&s;tood of <HI>filial</HI> fear, (the reve|rence
of children to parents), which
is di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>&s;lavi&s;h</HI> fear, and
will not doubt keep its place for ever.
In &s;hort, St <HI>Paul</HI> calls the <HI>law</HI> a <HI>&s;tate
of bondage,</HI> and the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> a <HI>&s;tate of li|berty.</HI></P>
<P>With relation to our neighbour,
the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> is likewi&s;e much more a law
of love than the <HI>Jewi&s;h;</HI> as ea&s;ily ap|pears
from our Saviour's &s;ermon on
the <HI>mount,</HI> and the whole &s;train of
the New Te&s;tament. It is true, he
reproaches the <HI>Jews</HI> in the&s;e words,
&startq;Thus have ye made the command|ment
of God of none effect by
your tradition<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xv. 6.</NOTE>;&endq; with much
more to the <HI>moral law,</HI> when they
punctually ob&s;erved the <HI>ceremonial
part.</HI> But &s;till love was more in&s;i&s;t|ed
upon in the <HI>new law,</HI> and the
Chri&s;tians were at fir&s;t as remarkable
for their love to one another, as they
are now for their hatred. It was a
<PB N="102" REF="109">
&s;trange in&s;tance of love, when &startq;the
multitude of them that believed
were of one heart and of one &s;oul;
neither &s;aid any, that ought of the
things he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was his own;
but they had all things common.&endq;</P>
<P>As to the difference between the
purity of manners required in the
<HI>new law</HI> and the <HI>old,</HI> let our Saviour's
doctrine be further con&s;idered. Our
very thoughts are required to <HI>be pure.</HI></P>
<P>The effects produced by the Chri|&s;tian
religion in its beginnings were
&s;uitable to the purity of the doctrine:
All debauchery was at an end: The
Chri&s;tians were &s;ober and temperate
in every thing; they bore with chear|fulne&s;s
the &s;corn and contempt of the
Heathens, who indulged them&s;elves
in their exce&s;&s;es, and from contempt
proceeded to hatred and cruelty;
which the true followers of the <HI>cruci|fied
Je&s;us</HI> endured al&s;o with the ut|mo&s;t
con&s;tancy! Men and women,
the young and aged of both &s;exes,
&s;uffered a variety of exqui&s;ite tor|ments,
rather than offer a little in|cen&s;e
<PB N="103" REF="110">
to a Heathen idol! and they
died praying for their per&s;ecutors and
tormentors!</P>
<P>The rage of the Heathens is the
le&s;s to be wondered at, becau&s;e they
&s;aw their own condemnation and re|proach
in the innocent, regular,
cha&s;te, humble lives of the Chri&s;tians.
The decay of the Heathen ceremo|nies,
the ridiculous and profane (ob|&s;cene)
inventions, all which &startq;brought
no &s;mall gain&endq; to the prie&s;ts, as
well as plea&s;ure to the ob&s;ervers, mu&s;t
have rai&s;ed the indignation of all
ranks and employments to the height
of fury. It is even thought that the
devil, whom our Saviour calls <HI>the
prince of this world,</HI> governed man|kind
in an open manner, uttering his
delu&s;ive fal&s;e oracles, and making pa|rents
kill their children with their
own hands, &startq;&s;ouls de&s;titute of
help<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;dom xii. 6.</NOTE>.&endq; No wonder therefore if
the Chri&s;tian religion, which oppo|&s;ed
all &s;uch worthle&s;s and abominable
practices, was hated and per&s;ecuted
<PB N="104" REF="111">
by tho&s;e who had an intere&s;t in keep|ing
them up. To &s;ay no more of the
great enemy of mankind, it is too
natural for men them&s;elves to oppre&s;s
and de&s;troy one another, upon the
lea&s;t interfering of their intere&s;ts,
yea, on the bare difference in opinion.
It is to be remembered, however,
that even in tho&s;e times of gro&s;s
ignorance and abomination, there
were &s;ome men who lived commend|ably,
and were &startq;accepted of God;&endq;
as St <HI>Paul</HI> te&s;tifies, that &startq;the Gen|tiles,
who had not the law,&endq; (the
written law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>), &startq;did by nature
the things contained in the law,&endq;
(the works of ju&s;tice and affection,
and other virtues), and were there|fore
&startq;a law unto them&s;elves,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
By which we may judge if we have
any right to condemn all the Hea|thens.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t indeed be owned, the Hea|then
world was in a very bad &s;tate
(as it &s;till is) without the light of the
<HI>go&s;pel:</HI> but the power of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI>
who rai&s;ed the dead to life, added
<PB N="105" REF="112">
this great miracle to the re&s;t, in ma|king
his doctrine prevail over the
greate&s;t powers of the earth and hell,
by the unlikelie&s;t means imaginable
to human rea&s;on. And how low &s;o|ever
Chri&s;tianity may be at pre&s;ent,
as to the practice, and its doctrine ri|diculed
by many who take its name,
yet the &s;ame power that e&s;tabli&s;hed it,
will keep it from &s;alling entirely:
&startq;For he mu&s;t reign till he hath put
all his enemies under his feet.&mdash;And
when all things &s;hall be &s;ub|dued

<P>THESE &s;acred writings are allowed
by all parties of Chri&s;tians to be of
divine authority, and con&s;equently
the rule or &s;tandard of faith and
manners. When they are ob&s;cure,
we mu&s;t be content to find our curio|&s;ity
put to a &s;tand, and our pride
mortified. Our duty is &s;till plain;
the love of God and our neighbour
admits of no glo&s;s nor re&s;triction.</P>
<P>The church of <HI>Rome</HI> receives &s;ome
books as <HI>canonical,</HI> or approved &s;crip|ture,
which Prote&s;tant churches re|ject,
the authors being mo&s;tly un|known,
and therefore called <HI>apocry|phal,</HI>
as well as reputed inferior in
the point of authority, and even in
&s;ublimity. The church of <HI>England,</HI>
however, appoints them to be read
&startq;for example of life, and in&s;truction
of manners<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Book of Common-prayer, 6th Article of Religion.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;cripture teaches the true and

(John</HI> iv.) &startq;God is a Spirit,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Tho&s;e &s;acred writings have a &s;urpri|&s;ing
force in them: and herein lies
the admirable difference betwixt them
and the works of men; the &s;cripture,
under plain and common expre&s;&s;ions,
contains a &s;trength and meaning
wholly divine; whereas men general|ly
fatigue them&s;elves to find &s;trong
and elegant terms for expre&s;&s;ing very
weak things. O that people knew
the benefit of reading the holy &s;crip|tures!
It is &s;urpri&s;ing that any per&s;on
&s;hould be hindered from making it
his con&s;tant &s;tudy, e&s;pecially the New
Te&s;tament! Should children be hin|dered
from reading their father's will?
Every body, on the contrary, &s;hould
be taught to read it with the greate&s;t
attention, re&s;pect, and love.&mdash;This
paragraph is from a Roman Catholic.</P>
<P>There was no written in&s;truction

&s;ufficient for the faithful and &s;incere.
This is called <HI>the patriarchal di&s;pen&s;a|tion.</HI>
But wickedne&s;s prevailed in the

<HI>Noah;</HI> but of nothing written, till the
law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and that only to one
nation: &s;o the wi&s;dom of God, the
Father of mankind, thought fit; for
&startq;God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.&endq;
Prophets were &s;ent to the <HI>Jews</HI> at dif|ferent
times, to reclaim them from
idolatry, and all their vices, as well as
to foretell the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI>
The writings of the Old Te&s;tament
are of various kinds, and not to be
parallelled in &s;ublimity and in&s;truction
but by tho&s;e of the New. This is
the <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel,</HI> to which
nothing is to be added; our Saviour,
by his doctrine and example, having
fini&s;hed all that was nece&s;&s;ary to be
made known to mankind.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tles wrote epi&s;tles to the
Chri&s;tian converts, to confirm them
<PB N="111" REF="118">
in their faith, and to remove their
mi&s;takes, particularly concerning the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law, which &s;ome Chri&s;tians
thought was &s;till in force, with other
errors in point of wor&s;hip; not omit|ting
to recommend the duties of &s;o|cial
life, as between hu&s;bands and
wives, parents and children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
With re&s;pect to the &s;piritual life, they
had our Saviour's life for a foun|dation,
which makes them in&s;i&s;t &s;o
much upon being &startq;united with God,
transformed into his image, loving
him with the whole heart;&endq; which
is the great duty and happine&s;s of
men and angels. They in&s;i&s;ted on
the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>&s;elf-denial,</HI> a doctrine
not current among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and le&s;s
known to the <HI>Heathens,</HI> who had ne|ver
heard of the fall. The &s;cripture,
in fine, has di&s;covered many truths
concerning the dignity and corruption
of man, and the incomprehen&s;ible

no toil, no &s;orrow, nor di&s;order in
man, either as to body or &s;oul.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the fall, man is much in

ought to be made them, on ac|count
of their elevated &s;tations, which
naturally tend to make them giddy;
to &s;ay nothing of their education,
which is often very poor: and then
we ought to con&s;ider them as be&s;ieged
by tho&s;e who commonly have no|thing
in view but their own ends, in
<PB N="114" REF="121">

<P>But we ought not to pore upon
the di&s;orders of per&s;ons in higher
ranks, whether in the church or &s;tate.
The great body of the people mu&s;t
pay taxes, and groan, without a&s;king
que&s;tions. Nor &s;hould the di&s;orders
of private life engage too much at|tention:
it is but a melancholy bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and apt to lead us into a forget|fulne&s;s
of our own per&s;onal di&s;orders
and vices, our &s;elf-conceit, and blind|ne&s;s
of mind. Humility is enjoined
to the meane&s;t as well as to the great|e&s;t;
and there is &s;ometimes as much
pride under coar&s;e cloaths as in robes
of &s;tate. We ought to look at home.
The con&s;equence of pride is to alie|nate
men from one another, and
from the &s;pirit of religion; as humi|lity
promotes mutual love, and is the
&s;ure&s;t mark of true piety.</P>
<P>Human nature is not yet &s;o cor|rupted,

<PB N="115" REF="122">
but this impre&s;&s;ion, or whatever

and we are ready to &s;atisfy
our&s;elves with a chimerical religion,
and with fal&s;e hopes in the merits and
redemption of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> when we have

<P>True humility, which has a loveli|ne&s;s
in it to a well-di&s;po&s;ed mind,
does not con&s;i&s;t in humble expre&s;&s;ions,
(which are very proper in the public
prayers), but in a deep &s;en&s;e of our
unworthine&s;s in the &s;ight of God,
and in doing nothing to get prai&s;e

<P>True repentance and conver&s;ion

finds its account in &s;uch &s;kirmi&s;hes.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there may be
no le&s;s pride in an ob&s;tinate &s;ilence,
when it comes from contempt, or the
fear of di&s;covering our own igno|rance.
Chri&s;tian &s;implicity, and a
mode&s;t opinion of our&s;elves, would
direct us how to behave in company

is a common, and a &s;ure rule.</P>
<P>Melancholy is much to be avoided;

&s;tate of joy recommended in holy
writ: &startq;God reignetl$, let the earth
be glad.&endq; &startq;Rejoice in the Lord
always,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, we are in a fallen &s;tate,

heaven and a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s.&endq; And tho
every thing we hunt after in this life
may be &s;aid to have delu&s;ion &s;tamped
upon it, yet there are things which
may be called real &s;atisfactions whil&s;t
they la&s;t. The plea&s;ures of the low|e&s;t
&s;en&s;es have a reality in them, and
the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip are much

us they infinitely &s;urpa&s;s all that can
be conceived.</P>
<P>But the great number of things to
be avoided, either as directly &s;inful,
or leading to &s;in, may be judged of
by looking at &s;ome of the in&s;tructions
of the Apo&s;tles, here and there; as

See al&s;o the next chapter, towards

pa&s;&s;ages: many more will be found

<P>Our bu&s;ine&s;s in this life is, to do as
&s;ick people, who put them&s;elves into
the hands of a &s;kilful phy&s;ician, who

Our Saviour has no need of
our <HI>&s;elf-denial;</HI> he only injoins the
renouncing the things of this world,

which he has put us in the way of

<P>Afflictions are &s;ent us purely for
our own good, like &s;overeign reme|dies;

<HEAD>Attention to the voice of God.</HEAD>

<P>Sometimes indeed the &s;cripture

&s;poken to holy men and prophets:
but this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be done by the

communications are not to be
de&s;ired; for it might proceed from a
de&s;ire of being di&s;tingui&s;hed or exalt|ed

the reward of &s;uch pride might ju&s;tly
be delu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="131">
The voice of God is addre&s;&s;ed to
the &s;oul of every per&s;on, (what high|er

nothing but want of attention hinders
it from being heard and obeyed.</P>
<P>Sinners are required in &s;cripture,
&startq;to return to their heart;&endq; to &startq;en|ter

<P>As to our want of attention, it
comes from numberle&s;s &s;ources: the

or amu&s;ement, to &s;ay no|thing
of fame or glory, all the&s;e are
great hinderances to attention. It is
true, the great body of the people
<PB N="125" REF="132">
have fewer things to hunt after than
tho&s;e in higher &s;tations; but every
cla&s;s of mortals, or rather every indi|vidual
per&s;on, hath his pur&s;uits and
di&s;tractions, by which the mind is
drawn off from the con&s;ideration of
its duty and eternal happine&s;s. The
poore&s;t have their projects and their
diver&s;ions, and are as much given to
&s;hew and luxury (generally &s;peaking)
as they can afford.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, the number of di&s;|tractions
that hinder our attention is
next to infinite. How many cares!
how many pa&s;&s;ions! how many whims!
and how many wild imaginations,
which may be looked upon as a
particular di&s;temper, and to which
tho&s;e who are idle are the mo&s;t
liable! Some imaginations are ridi|culous
to the la&s;t degree, others are
horrid. Hone&s;t labour, what a hap|pine&s;s
it is! A wandering imagina|tion
is often a heavy cro&s;s.</P>
<P>Involuntary imaginations are not
indeed criminal; they come into the
head like the dreams of the night;
<PB N="126" REF="133">
and it is not in the power of rea&s;on
to thru&s;t them out; or they return
very &s;oon to the attack. The crimi|nal
imaginations are &s;uch as ri&s;e from
the corrupt inclinations, and may be
&s;aid to have their root in the heart;
they &s;pring from the de&s;ire of &s;en&s;ual
plea&s;ure, or riches, or command, or
prai&s;e; and by fo&s;tering the&s;e our
de&s;ires, (e&s;pecially that of prai&s;e and
e&s;teem), we take &s;ancies of our own
worth and excellency, and imagine we
are admired when we are laughed at.</P>
<P>What &s;hall deliver us from this
&s;tate of folly, and &s;lavery, and &s;in?
Nothing but the &s;overeign power of
God. It is true, we have the power
of <HI>a&s;king,</HI> and it is prom&s;ed we &s;hall
<HI>obtain;</HI> but it is with the condition
that we do not a&s;k <HI>ami&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>To prayer we are to join watch|fulne&s;s,
which is the &s;ame with at|tention.
We hear al&s;o of <HI>recollection,</HI>
which &s;ignifies the <HI>gathering in</HI> the
&s;cattered affections of the heart, as
well as our wandering imaginations,
that our love may be fixed upon the
<PB N="127" REF="134">
only object worthy thereof. If the
heart were in good order, the head
would grow wi&s;er of cour&s;e. Invo|luntary
imaginations might contribute
to humble our vanity.</P>
<P>One great error, which argues the
bad &s;tate of our mind, and our folly,
is our being in &s;uch a dread of cen|&s;ure;
&s;o that we may rather be &s;aid
to give attention to the voice of men
than to the voice of God! That this
infirmity has its root in our pride is
very plain.</P>
<P>But recollection being a thing &s;o
little under&s;tood by the generality of
people, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to
add a few lines more about it. Re|collection,
then, is that di&s;po&s;ition
we mu&s;t be in for hearkening to God.
He &s;peaks to the heart, by giving it
good inclinations or motions. He
&s;peaks to the under&s;tanding, by ma|king
di&s;coveries of his divine nature,
and the nature of man. Common
rea&s;on may be called <HI>the voice of
God.</HI> The beautiful order and pro|ductions
of the creation &s;trike us;
<PB N="128" REF="135">
and what we &s;ee and feel of the im|perfect
&s;tate of things, is a &s;ort of
&s;peaking too, and de&s;igned to wean
our hearts from earthly &s;atisfactions.
Great attention is nece&s;&s;ary, that when
we find our affections out of order,
(which we may find in the beginning,
when they are not too &s;trong), we
may &s;trive to turn them away, and
apply them to lawful objects. Rea|&s;on
would be of &s;ervice to &s;hew the
emptine&s;s and trouble of all worldly
pur&s;uits, which would be well &s;up|ported
by experience. But chiefly,
if the love of God were kindled in
the heart, it would con&s;ume all im|purity,
and put an end to all di&s;order.</P>
<P>If, after all the care we can take,
and all the attention we can give, we
find our&s;elves &s;till haunted and per&s;e|cuted
by the involuntary imaginations
already mentioned; the advice given
by per&s;ons of experience in the &s;pi|ritual
life is, to contemn tho&s;e imper|tinent
intruders, like the buzzing of
flies, and not to be di&s;couraged by
them, &s;ince nothing involuntary is
<PB N="129" REF="136">
&s;inful. No doubt we ought to a|bridge
our diver&s;ions, and even our
bu&s;ine&s;s, as much as po&s;&s;ible, that &s;o
our heads may not be &s;illed with the
things we have been employed about,
or new images rai&s;ed by &s;ome connec|tion
with them, or (which is often
the ca&s;e) without any connection.</P>
<P>But that recollection is no le&s;s the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the heart than of the head,
(or rather, that it chiefly belongs to
the heart), is evident from the&s;e
words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> &startq;Keep thy heart
with all diligence, for out of it are
the i&s;&s;ues of life.&endq; And by keep|ing
the heart is not only meant being
on our guard again&s;t our de&s;ires and
appetites, but likewi&s;e again&s;t per&s;onal
aver&s;ions, which would prevent all
tran&s;ports of anger, nay, the lea&s;t ap|proach
of ill humour.</P>
<P>To do all our actions as in the pre|&s;ence
of God, (from whom nothing
is hid), and with the de&s;ign of plea|&s;ing
him, (which ju&s;tice requires), is
the be&s;t &s;tate the heart can be in; it
is called <HI>the pre&s;ence of God,</HI> as well as
<PB N="130" REF="137">
<HI>recollection,</HI> the mind being <HI>habitually</HI>
in a &s;tate of attention to the divine
will. Nor is there any fear of negli|gence,
or doing our work the wrong
way; for we are not to let things
drop out of our hands. Diligence
and exactne&s;s is even a part of reli|gion,
when that principle takes place,
(injoined by St <HI>Paul</HI>), &startq;to do all
things to the glory of God.&endq;</P>
<P>Such an attentive good di&s;po&s;ition
of &s;oul al&s;o gets the name of <HI>prayer:</HI>
for the command, <HI>to pray always,</HI>
cannot be meant either of vocal
prayer, or of meditation; and there|fore
is only to be under&s;tood of the
internal frame of the heart, or <HI>inward
man.</HI> Such a &s;tate in &s;cripture is call|ed
<HI>walking with God.</HI></P>
<P>Outward helps are by no means to
be neglected. The public meetings
of devotion are to be frequented, and
at &s;everal times of the day (when ne|ce&s;&s;ary
bu&s;ine&s;s can allow) a pious
book may be looked at, were it but a
few lines; and even in the fields, or
within doors, at any labour, a peti|tion
<PB N="131" REF="138">
may be put up, whether in
words or &s;ilently, &s;ince God regards
the heart only. A well-di&s;po&s;ed heart
or &s;pirit can find a thou&s;and ways of
expre&s;&s;ing it&s;elf to the Father of &s;pi|rits,
in prayers or prai&s;es, without
&s;tudy or re&s;traint. The meane&s;t of
the works of nature, were it but a
&s;traw, is matter of adoration; and we
have a large field for &s;upplication,
when we con&s;ider all our wants, and
the hazards we run, e&s;pecially that of
forfeiting the happine&s;s de&s;igned for
us in the next life. As all the attri|butes
of God are infinite, &s;o is his
conde&s;cen&s;ion: he &s;uffers children to
&s;peak to him, and delights in true
&s;implicity.</P>
<P>But, as is &s;aid already, if all the
care we can take is not &s;ufficient to
rid us of the&s;e pitiful imaginations, but
that they plague us even in the time
we &s;et apart for prayer and retire|ment,
we &s;hould bear them as the
puni&s;hment of our pa&s;t errors and
vices, remaining united to God in
heart and in will, which no power in
<PB N="132" REF="139">
nature can force. By this conduct
our di&s;tractions and ab&s;urd fancies
blow over the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, why people of all
ranks, that are plunged in worldly
bu&s;ine&s;s, either for nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence,
or for gratifying their pride,
and all their de&s;ires, complain &s;o little
of being di&s;turbed with &s;uch fooli&s;h
imaginations? the an&s;wer is, that the
generality of the world &s;eldom apply
their mind to any thing but for their
own plea&s;ure in &s;ome form or other;
and &s;o they cannot be &s;en&s;ible of the
imaginations that break in upon tho&s;e
few that &s;et their affections <HI>on things a|bove,</HI>
and earne&s;tly de&s;ire to plea&s;e God.
If &s;uch imaginations are ca&s;t in by the
devil, (as it is commonly thought
they are), he does not want to di&s;turb
the fancy whil&s;t he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the heart; or if they are only the na|tural
effect of our di&s;order &s;ince the
fall, it may plea&s;e God to let them
tyrannize over us for our purification,
and as an antidote to our pride. The
ble&s;&s;ed God wants not to di&s;turb us,
<PB N="133" REF="140">
much le&s;s to de&s;troy us. Our happi|ne&s;s
is his great aim; and in the or|der
of things, purification mu&s;t go
before happine&s;s; for &startq;no impure
thing can enter into the kingdom
of heaven.&endq; What di&s;tre&s;s of all
kinds and degrees mu&s;t be undergone
before the &s;oul can attain to that ne|ce&s;&s;ary
purity or holine&s;s, is as impo&s;|&s;ible
to conceive, as the joy that waits it
through all eternity.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> It is to have God to be his
God, and his only ruler and governor.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why call you that his chief good
and happine&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e God is the chief good in
him&s;elf, and the cau&s;e of all good and
happine&s;s, in every &s;oul that is entirely
ruled and governed by him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is man's greate&s;t evil and
mi&s;ery?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is to &s;et up &s;elf, as an idol, in
God's room, to be ruled and governed
by it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="143">
<HI>Q.</HI> Why call you that his greate&s;t evil
and mi&s;ery?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e the &s;etting up &s;elf in
God's room is the greate&s;t evil and in|ju&s;tice
in it&s;elf, and the cau&s;e of all o|ther
evils and mi&s;eries what&s;oever.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who was the fir&s;t author of this e|vil

<P><HI>A.</HI> The devil and his angels, who
infected our fir&s;t parents, and in them
all their po&s;terity, with this horrible
corruption.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Has this corruption entered deep
into man's nature?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It has entered &s;o deep, that the
very life and being of his nature, as it
is corrupted, is nothing el&s;e but &s;elf-will,
&s;elf-love, &s;elf-intere&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in&s;o|much

<PB N="5" REF="144">
pride of life; or, the love of riches,
plea&s;ures, and honours; or, &s;elf-inte|re&s;t,
&s;elf-plea&s;ing, and &s;elf-e&s;teem.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the fruits which the&s;e
&s;ins produce in mens lives and conver&s;a|tions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They produce all the vices and
crimes which too much abound every
where in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Into what e&s;tate is mankind redu|ced
by this abominable idol &s;elf, and its
cur&s;ed fruits?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Mankind is thereby naturally re|duced
into a &s;tate of bani&s;hment from
God and all good; and of a mi&s;erable
&s;lavery and captivity, under the power
of the devil, and of all evil.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What was nece&s;&s;arily required to
the redeeming of mankind from &s;uch a
mi&s;erable &s;tate?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary that the injury
and di&s;honour done to God, by &s;etting
up &s;uch a vile unworthy idol in his
room, &s;hould be repaired; as al&s;o, that
the idol it&s;elf &s;hould be &s;o broken down,
and ca&s;t our, as it might never again u|&s;urp
the throne of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was it in the power of man to per|form
both the&s;e conditions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> So far from it, that no le&s;s power
<PB N="6" REF="145">
than omnipotency it&s;elf was nece&s;&s;ary

of them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Has any one then been willing to
undertake, and able to perform &s;o great a
work?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes indeed, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
the eternal Son of God, true God and
true man. He alone is the Saviour of
the world, and the Redeemer of man|kind;
who is both able and willing to
&s;ave to the utmo&s;t all that come to God
through him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What moved him to undertake &s;o
great a work and labour?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His great love to his Father's
glory, and his great pity and compa&s;|&s;ion
for lo&s;t mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What did Je&s;us, in order to repair
the di&s;honour done to God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e man had di&s;honoured
God, by leaving the lowe&s;t and la&s;t
place, which was due to him, and u|&s;urping
the fir&s;t and chief place, which
belonged to God; therefore, to make
&s;atisfaction and reparation, the Son of
God left the throne of his glory, the
fir&s;t and chief place due to him; and
taking our nature upon him, he de|&s;cended
into the lowe&s;t and la&s;t place,
<PB N="7" REF="146">
even into the room and place of &s;in|ners.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What further &s;atisfaction and re|paration
made he, when he had put him|&s;elf
in the place of &s;inners?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He meekly &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to
all the poverty, contempt, and &s;uffer|ings,
which were due to them; and al|ways
honoured his heavenly Father
with an obedience and humility, which
was more boundle&s;s and unlimited than
was the pride and di&s;obedience where|with
man had di&s;honoured him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What was the mo&s;t admirable in|&s;tance
of the obedience, humility, and
charity of the Son of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His offering up him&s;elf a &s;acrifice
upon the cro&s;s, in the deepe&s;t humilia|tions
and &s;ufferings both of &s;oul and
body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was this &s;acrifice acceptable, &s;ati&s;|fying,
and meritorious, in the &s;ight of his
heavenly Father?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was &s;o acceptable, &s;atisfying,
and meritorious, that his heavenly Fa|ther
found his ju&s;tice thereby not only
&s;atisfied, but likewi&s;e indebted to his
dear Son; and that he was obliged to
grant him, in favour of mankind, whom
he &s;o much loved, all grace and glory,
<PB N="8" REF="147">
and every good thing that he de&s;ired
for them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides making &s;a|tis$faction
and reparation, that Ie&s;us
&s;hould ca&s;t forth the idol &s;elf, with its
corrupt fruits, out of our hearts, before
we can enjoy the heavenly glory which he
has merited for us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that
neither the mercies of God, nor the
merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall ever bring
us to the heavenly glory, till fir&s;t this
great work be effectually begun in our
&s;ouls, and al&s;o thereafter carried on
and fini&s;hed by the power of our Re|deemer.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How does our dear Redeemer mo&s;t
u&s;ually begin this work in the &s;oul?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By awakening the con&s;cience
with a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of its gro&s;&s;er &s;ins
and vices, and with the fear of hell|torments,
which are due to them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily accompany
or follow after this?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A firm belief of God's mercy in
Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to all them that truly re|pent
of their &s;ins, and for&s;ake them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What effects do both the&s;e produce
in the &s;oul?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> An earne&s;t &s;triving and wre&s;tling
<PB N="9" REF="148">
again&s;t its gro&s;&s;er &s;ins, with a diligent
u&s;e of &s;uch means and mortifications as
may help it to be victorious over them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Doth the &s;oul, in this &s;tate, u&s;ual|ly
make any con&s;iderable progre&s;s and ad|vancement?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Although &s;ometimes it may &s;eem
to it&s;elf to make con&s;iderable progre&s;s,
yet really it advances but little, &s;o long
as its inward corruptions, its inward
pride, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;en&s;uality, which
are the root of its outward &s;ins, do &s;till
continue in their &s;trength and vigour.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Where can the &s;oul find a proper
and an effectual remedy to purge out the&s;e
inward corruptions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in
his life and doctrine, and in his death
upon the cro&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are tho&s;e remedies which are
to be found there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the life and doctrine of the
Son of God, and in his death upon the
cro&s;s, there are abundance of humilia|tions,
reproaches, and contempt, to pull
down our pride; of poverty, naked|ne&s;s,
and di&s;engagement, to purge out
our covetou&s;ne&s;s; and of labours, pains,
and &s;ufferings, to mortify our love of
ea&s;e and plea&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="149">
<HI>Q.</HI> Is it nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;oul do truly
love and e&s;teem the&s;e things, and willing|ly
embrace them, whenever it plea&s;es God
to &s;end them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> However the inferior &s;en&s;ual part
of the &s;oul may grieve and be afflicted,
yet the &s;uperior part mu&s;t truly love
and e&s;teem them, and willingly embrace
them; el&s;e it cannot follow Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, nor can the love of riches, ho|nours,
and plea&s;ures, be truly purged out.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is the &s;oul enabled and pre|vailed
with to take &s;o bitter a medicine?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the divine light which it re|ceives
from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and which en|lightens
it in &s;ome mea&s;ure to know it|&s;elf
and the world, and to know God,
and to know Je&s;us the Mediator.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does the &s;oul &s;ee it&s;elf and the
world to be, in the divine light?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the divine light it &s;ees it&s;elf to
be nothing but mi&s;ery and &s;in, and that
it has truly de&s;erved hell; as al&s;o it
&s;ees the riches, honours, and plea&s;ures,
of the world, whereby it has been de|luded,
to be but mere empty &s;hadows:
and both the&s;e make it de&s;pi&s;e the
world, and hate it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does the &s;oul di&s;cover of God,
in the divine light?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="150">
<HI>A.</HI> In the divine light, the &s;oul &s;ees
God to be all infinite goodne&s;s, love,
beauty, and excellency, and that all its
happine&s;s is in him; which makes the
&s;oul hunger and thir&s;t, and pant and
breathe after him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does the &s;oul, in the divine
light, di&s;cover of Je&s;us the Mediator?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It di&s;covers that Je&s;us is the true
and only way to the Father; and that
there is no other way but his poverty,
contempt, and &s;ufferings, to ca&s;t out
man's covetou&s;ne&s;s, pride, and &s;en&s;uali|ty;
and al&s;o that his love to man is
boundle&s;s and a&s;toni&s;hing, in walking
&s;o willingly before him in the way of
the cro&s;s, to bring him unto God: all
which con&s;train the &s;oul to love Je&s;us,
and cordially to embrace his doctrine
and example of the cro&s;s, as being the
only way to its own happine&s;s in God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When the &s;oul has thus been enabled,
by the divine light, to de&s;pi&s;e the world
and hate it&s;elf, to love God, and $$rne&s;t|ly
de&s;ire him, and to embrace Chri&s;t and
his cro&s;s, as the only way to the Father,
is there any thing further nece&s;&s;ary for it
to do?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, it mu&s;t, by the divine grace,
apply all its vigour and activity to per|&s;evere
<PB N="12" REF="151">
and continue &s;tedfa&s;tly in the&s;e
and &s;uch like exerci&s;es; till all its acti|vity
being much &s;pent and exhau&s;ted,
it does at length, by degrees, enter in|to
the pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein con&s;i&s;ts the nature of this
pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts in patiently bearing the
operations, and quietly following the
motions and attractions of the divine
grace, which now are felt, and percei|ved
very &s;en&s;ibly in it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the exerci&s;e, or di&s;po&s;ition
of the &s;oul, in this pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is to take all its plea&s;ure and
contentment in abiding in God's pre|&s;ence,
in depending upon him, and lea|ving
it&s;elf entirely to his di&s;po&s;al, as a
continual &s;acrifice to his holy will.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the fruits and effects of
this &s;tate in the &s;oul?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It does more effectually &s;ubdue
and ca&s;t out the carnal worldly &s;elf,
with its inward corruptions, and gives
the &s;oul a more complete and ea&s;y vic|tory
over its &s;ins and imperfections, and
makes it flouri&s;h very &s;en&s;ibly in faith,
hope, and charity, in humility, meek|ne&s;s,
patience, re&s;ignation, and all o|ther
Chri&s;tian graces and virtues.</P>

<HI>Q.</HI> Has &s;uch a &s;oul any thing more to
do, but to continue and advance in all
the&s;e graces and virtues?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Its activity having been already
&s;pent, it has not much to do; but it has
much to &s;uffer, and a more terrible pu|rification
to undergo than ever it had be|fore.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why &s;o?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e in the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;en|&s;ible
divine graces and virtues, there
grows up a &s;ecret, &s;piritual, refined,
&s;ubtle &s;elf, which, if God did not pre|vent
it, would at length become more
de&s;tructive to the &s;oul, and more di&s;|plea&s;ing
unto him, than the former
gro&s;s carnal idol was.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein con&s;i&s;ts the malignity of
this &s;piritual &s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In robbing God of his glory, by
appropriating to it&s;elf the graces and

it on all hands with darkne&s;s
and troubles; whereby it is reduced to
the greate&s;t agonies and &s;traits.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Are the&s;e agonies &s;oon over?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the former &s;tates, the &s;oul
had many changes or vici&s;&s;itudes, of
light and darkne&s;s, of temptations and
con&s;olations, of painful aridities and
&s;en&s;ible joys: but in the&s;e la&s;t trials,
the grievous temptations and agonies
do &s;till increa&s;e, and are never ended,
if the &s;oul be of any competent &s;trength
<PB N="15" REF="154">
to bear them, till it be utterly lo&s;t, and
peri&s;h, as to its own apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> For what end is the &s;oul brought to
&s;uch a terrible &s;tate?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That it may learn to be &s;acrifi|ced,
ab&s;olutely, without any re&s;erve,
to the will and order of God, even
with re&s;pect to grace, virtue, &s;alvation,
eternity, as well as to all temporal
things; that &s;o all &s;elf, both &s;piritual
and carnal, may be wholly rooted out,
and annihilated in the &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When &s;elf is thus reduced to no|thing
in the &s;oul, what then becomes of
it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When &s;elf is really reduced to
nothing, which is the only place that
of right belongs to it, then Je&s;us takes
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his right, and by degrees
becomes all in the &s;oul: &s;o that no
more &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;elf-intere&s;t,
&s;elf-will, or any thing of &s;elf, is to be
found in it; but only the righteou&s;ne&s;s,
the intere&s;t, the will, and the all of
Je&s;us.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are &s;ome of the principal
characters or di&s;po&s;itions of that &s;oul
wherein Je&s;us has recovered the full do|minion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A profound peace, a pure di&s;in|tere&s;ted
<PB N="16" REF="155">
love, and al&s;o a child-like in|nocency
and &s;implicity, whereby the
&s;oul, for its own &s;afety, is u&s;ually kept
from any certain knowledge of its own
happy &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is Je&s;us then the only Lord and
King of that &s;oul, who rules and governs
it ab&s;olutely, according to his own will,
without any oppo&s;ition?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, indeed; which as it is man's
greate&s;t happine&s;s in this life, &s;o it is
the great end and de&s;ign of the Chri|&s;tian
religion, and all that &s;eems to be
nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the &s;oul, and make
it ready for the immediate enjoyment
of the heavenly glory.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What means mu&s;t we make u&s;e of,
whereby we may attain to this great end
and de&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That we may attain to this great
end, we mu&s;t make u&s;e both of the in|ternal
and external means.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the mo&s;t effectual inter|nal
means?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are, the inward graces of
repentance, faith, and the prayer of
the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is repentance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is &s;uch a true &s;orrow for our
&s;ins, as makes us embrace the means,
<PB N="17" REF="156">
how bitter or painful &s;oever they may
be, to extirpate them, and to repair
the wrongs we have done by them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what u&s;e is repentance for help|ing
us forward to the great end of our
Chri&s;tianity?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, for a|mending,
and obtaining pardon of all
the &s;ins and faults that are committed
through the whole Chri&s;tian cour&s;e;
but more e&s;pecially in the beginning of
it, when the &s;inner breaks off his &s;ins
and evil habits, and returns to God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the evidence of things not
&s;een, even of the all of God, and of
the nothing of the creature; whereby
the &s;oul, which receives that evidence,
believes in God, and puts all its tru&s;t
and confidence in him alone, and not
in the creature, or in any thing that it
can do.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the mo&s;t native and imme|diate
effect of this faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The greater and &s;tronger that
this faith is, the more it engages God
to take the &s;oul into his own particular
care, conduct, and protection; and al|&s;o
it makes the &s;oul the more pliable,
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, re&s;igned, and abandoned to
<PB N="18" REF="157">
the divine will and conduct in all
things.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what u&s;e is faith for a&s;&s;i&s;ting
us to attain unto the great end and de&s;ign
of our holy religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, for di&s;|engaging
the &s;oul from the creatures,
and uniting it to God; and for guiding
and leading it &s;afely into that divine
union, through all the dangers, delu|&s;ions,
and temptations, wherewith the
devil, the world, and our own corrup|tion
do continually a&s;&s;ault us, in all
the different periods of our Chri&s;tian
cour&s;e; but more e&s;pecially in the la&s;t
trials, when the &s;oul can &s;ee nothing
but death and darkne&s;s on all hands.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the prayer of the heart?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is an inward conver&s;ation, or
communication betwixt God and the
&s;oul, wherein the &s;oul, conformably to
the &s;tate it is in, offers up to God its
de&s;ires, or a&s;pirations, or affections;
or &s;imply expo&s;es it&s;elf before him, lea|ving
it&s;elf wholly to his will: And
wherein God corre&s;ponds accordingly,
by communicating his graces and fa|vours
to the &s;oul, as he &s;ees mo&s;t expe|dient
for it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what u&s;e then is vocal prayer?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="158">
<HI>A.</HI> It is of mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e, not
only in the public wor&s;hip, but al&s;o in
the mo&s;t private retirements, whenever
it may &s;erve as a means to fix our atten|tion,
or a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the inward devotion
and prayer of the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what u&s;e is prayer for advan|cing
us to the great end of our religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is of &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e from
the beginning to the end of the Chri&s;tian
cour&s;e, that the &s;oul's advancement de|pends
on its fidelity therein; &s;o that
whoever neglects prayer can never make
any con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the Chri|&s;tian
life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the mo&s;t effectual exter|nal
means whereby we may attain to the
great end of our religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The mo&s;t effectual external means
are, the holy &s;criptures, the &s;acra|ments,
and the other offices of the &s;a|cred
order of pa&s;tors.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How does it appear that the holy
&s;criptures are a mo&s;t effectual means to
bring us to the great end of our religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It appears in this, that as the
holy &s;criptures are all written by divine
in&s;piration, &s;o they do all tend to hum|ble
man and exalt God, and to turn
man away from &s;elf-love and the love
<PB N="20" REF="159">
of the creatures, unto the love of God;
and do contain inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures
of divine light and wi&s;dom, all contri|buting
to that end.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How ought we to read and &s;tudy
the &s;criptures, &s;o as to profit by them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> With an earne&s;t de&s;ire to know
God's will, for no other end but that
we may practi&s;e it; and with a humble
heart, depending on God for giving us
the under&s;tanding of them, &s;o far as he
&s;ees it nece&s;&s;ary for that end.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein are the &s;acraments u&s;eful
to us, for our attaining to the great end
of religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;|&s;ary,
becau&s;e the awfulne&s;s and &s;olemni|ty
of the my&s;teries which are celebra|ted
in them, do &s;erve to awaken us from
our dulne&s;s and &s;tupidity, and to rai&s;e
up our hearts to God; and becau&s;e, in
the due u&s;e of them, we are &s;olemnly
engaged to our duty, and &s;ingularly
a&s;&s;i&s;ted to perform it, by the plentiful
effu&s;ion of the divine grace upon all
tho&s;e who with humble and obedient
hearts ob&s;erve the&s;e divine ordinances.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the evil of de&s;pi&s;ing, or
wilfully neglecting the &s;acraments?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Whoever de&s;pi&s;es, or wilfully ne|glects
<PB N="21" REF="160">
the&s;e holy ordinances, he not on|ly
deprives him&s;elf of the &s;piritual be|nefits
and inward graces, which always
accompany the humble and pious u&s;e of
them, but al&s;o he thereby ranks him|&s;elf
even among&s;t the infidels, in that
he will not make u&s;e of the outward vi|&s;ible
&s;igns and &s;ymbols ordained by
Chri&s;t him&s;elf, to &s;eparate and di&s;tin|gui&s;h
betwixt his di&s;ciples and all o|thers;
and that he will not confe&s;s him
before men, nor own him to be his
Lord and King, in that &s;olemn &s;acred
manner which he him&s;elf hath appoint|ed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what u&s;e are the other offices
to us, of the &s;acred order of pa&s;tors?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Of &s;uch &s;ingular u&s;e, that nothing
more effectual could be done for us, than
to appoint an order of men to feed us
with Chri&s;t's doctrine, and to walk be|fore
us in his &s;teps; and &s;o to teach us,
both by word and deed, how we may
die to our&s;elves and to the creatures,
that God alone may live and reign in
us. And although &s;ome may fail in
their duty, yet we have the pious la|bours,
writings, and examples, of o|ther
faithful pa&s;tors, which are &s;till of
&s;ingular u&s;e and advantage to us.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="161">
<HI>Q.</HI> Are there any general means, com|mon
to all mankind, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to
attain to the great end and de&s;ign of
[the Chri&s;tian and] all true religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, there are the works of cre|ation
and providence outwardly; and
al&s;o an inward remainder of the image
of God, which, by the merits and in|terce&s;&s;ion
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is continued
with all mankind, as an inward &s;eed or
principle of grace, in the mid&s;t of their
corruption.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the fruits and effects of
this good principle, in the hearts and lives
of men?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The more that the good motions
thereof, in oppo&s;ition to the motions of
corruption, are followed and obeyed, it
becomes the &s;tronger, and God com|municates
his ble&s;&s;ing to it, whereby it
has become the &s;pring and fountain of
many good things in the works and wri|tings
of the heathens: but the more
its motions are rejected, and tho&s;e of
corruption followed and obeyed, this
good principle becomes the more lan|guid
and imperceptible, and &s;ometimes
&s;eems to be utterly extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein do the works of creation
and providence &s;erve men as a means
<PB N="23" REF="162">
whereby they may attain to the end of all
true religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In &s;etting plainly before mens
eyes the greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s of God,
and the nothingne&s;s of man; that his
very &s;oul and body, and all the good
he has, are God's creatures, and do
belong to him; and that therefore he
ought not to rob God, by a&s;cribing or
appropriating any of the&s;e things to
him&s;elf, but abide in an entire naked|ne&s;s
and poverty of &s;pirit before him,
leaving him&s;elf and all he hath in God's
hands, to be di&s;po&s;ed of, and ruled and
governed by him, without any oppo&s;i|tion,
as being the only rightful Lord and
King, and true proprietor of all things.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why then might not a Heathen be
&s;auved by the means of the&s;e plain truths,
&s;earched out, and followed by the good
principle of the divine grace within him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> How plain &s;oever the&s;e truths
may be in them&s;elves, yet all men are
&s;o blinded with &s;elf-love, and the love
of the world, that even among&s;t tho&s;e
who have the light of the &s;criptures,
and the doctrine and example of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t to guide them, there are but few
who penetrate the&s;e truths &s;o fully as
they ought to do, and &s;till fewer who
<PB N="24" REF="163">
practi&s;e them: Therefore it is not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed that any among&s;t the Heathen,
who have none to guide them, can en|ter
into the&s;e truths; or if any did, and
practi&s;ed accordingly, it is not to be
doubted but God would communicate
him&s;elf unto them, and &s;ave them by
the grace and merits of his Son, even
as he &s;aved the patriarchs, and others
his &s;ervants of old, before the &s;criptures
were written.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Alas, then, if there he &s;o few every
where, who enter into the&s;e great and
nece&s;&s;ary truths, what &s;hall become of
mankind! Is it not to be feared that
&s;elf and the world &s;hall, in a &s;hort time,
have dominion over the hearts of all men
living on the earth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the wor&s;t of times God had,
and always will have &s;ome to &s;erve
him; and although the greate&s;t a|bounding
of all evil is foretold to be in
the la&s;t days, yet the greate&s;t abound|ing
of all good is foretold to follow af|ter
it: for as in the purification of the
&s;oul, the darke&s;t night of trials and
temptations goes before the brighte&s;t
day of divine peace; &s;o, in the church,
and in the world in general, after the
greate&s;t di&s;orders and corruptions, &s;hall
<PB N="25" REF="164">
follow the greate&s;t purity and order.
Righteou&s;ne&s;s, truth, and peace &s;hall
flouri&s;h; Satan &s;hall be bound, and ca&s;t
out; and JESUS &s;hall be ab&s;olute Lord
and King in the hearts of all men.</P>
<P>Even &s;o, Lord Je&s;us, come quickly. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
