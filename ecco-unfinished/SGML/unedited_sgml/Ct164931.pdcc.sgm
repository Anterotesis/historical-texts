<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> is become an univer&s;al Complaint, that the Accounts of <HI>OXFORD</HI>, hitherto publi&s;hed, are full of <HI>Mi&s;takes</HI>, and <HI>Mi&s;repre&s;entations.&mdash; ANTHONY WOOD</HI> was an <HI>Antiquarian</HI> and an <HI>Old Woman:</HI> Mr. <HI>SALMON</HI>, Author of the <HI>Pre&s;ent State of the Univer&s;ities</HI>, is a <HI>Cambridge-Man:</HI> and that the Reverend Mr. <HI>POINTER</HI>, Rector of Slapton in Northampton&s;hire, was but little acquainted with our <HI>Academical Annals</HI>, is evident from his &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>MALLARD</HI> of <HI>All-Souls</HI> College to be a <HI>GOOSE</HI>.</P>
<P>The judicious and ingenious Author of the <HI>Pocket Companion for Oxford</HI>, has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure done Ju&s;tice to this entertaining Subject: but perhaps he has <HI>copied</HI> &s;ome of his Predece&s;&s;ors <HI>too clo&s;ely:</HI> On which Account, we are inclined to prefer the <HI>OXFORD GUIDE</HI>, as a more <HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> and
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
<HI>original Work</HI>.&mdash;But, notwith&s;tanding, both the&s;e Authors, like the re&s;t, out of Neglect or Ig|norance, have omitted, among other Curio&s;ities, &s;everal <HI>important Particulars</HI>, equally calculated to engage the Notice, and intere&s;t the Attention of Strangers.</P>
<P>To rectify the&s;e <HI>Mi&s;takes</HI>, but more particularly to &s;upply the&s;e <HI>Omi&s;&s;ions</HI>, is the De&s;ign of the following Work. And we can venture to affirm, that the Book we now offer, when bound up with the <HI>Oxford Guide</HI>, will exhibit a more <HI>complete Survey</HI> of <HI>OXFORD</HI> than any yet extant. &mdash; In a Word, that u&s;eful Performance, improved with the Acce&s;&s;ion of this <HI>nece&s;&s;ary SUPPLEMENT</HI>, will give all the Satisfaction which an agreeable Subject can afford, or an inqui&s;itive Curio&s;ity can require.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Companion</HI> to the Guide, AND A <HI>Guide</HI> to the Companion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ANTIQUARIANS, in general, &s;eem to have mi&s;taken the etymology of <HI>Bello&s;itum</HI>, the reputed Roman name of the City of <HI>Oxford</HI>. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Pointer</HI>, in his manu&s;cript notes on Ri&s;hanger, who flouri&s;hed in the reign of Henry the Third, writes this word <HI>Bulo&s;itum</HI>, and derives it from the Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, i. e. <HI>The City of Wi&s;dom.</HI> This derivation I cannot entirely approve; but mu&s;t own, that it has &s;ugge&s;ted a manner of
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;pelling the word, which, I take to be right, viz. <HI>Bullo&s;itum</HI>.&mdash;<Q>Mr. Hearne informs us, and indeed the common name <HI>Oxford</HI> implies the &s;ame, &startq;that a part of the river <HI>I&s;is</HI> near the town was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>Ford</HI> &endq;in England for the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Oxen</HI>.</Q> And why not likewi&s;e for <HI>Bulls?</HI>&mdash;I readily agree with that judicious author, that <HI>Oxford</HI> is never written <HI>Ou&s;eford</HI>, or <HI>I&s;eford</HI>, in the Saxon annals, or in William of Newburgh; and that the ad|jacent pari&s;h of <HI>Bin&s;ey</HI>, where the principal ford is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been, ought to be called, according to it's ancient Latin name, <HI>Bu&s;neia</HI>, BUSNEY, from the Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, an <HI>Ox.</HI> But it &s;hould be remembered, that there are many <HI>hindred appellations</HI> in and about <HI>Oxford</HI>, which conduce to illu&s;trate and confirm my hypothe&s;is. Need I mention <HI>Bullington</HI> Hundred, in which <HI>Oxford</HI> is &s;ituated, <HI>Bullock's Lane</HI>, and <HI>Bull|&s;tock Bridge?</HI> &mdash; Are not our frequent Bull baitings in <HI>Oxford</HI> &s;tanding memorials of this <HI>original</HI> Denomination? The &s;ame Antiquarian, in his learned preface to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 18, 19.</NOTE> <HI>Robert of Glouce&s;ter</HI>, has certainly given a wrong interpretation of the origin of a cu&s;tom &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at <HI>Oxford</HI>, which plainly regards the point in que&s;tion. His words are the&s;e. <Q>&startq;'Tis no wonder that in the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
jollities of the fir&s;t of May, formerly the cu&s;|tom of blowing with, and drinking in, horns, &s;o much prevailed: which, tho' it be now generally di&s;u&s;ed, yet the cu&s;tom of blowing them prevails at that &s;ea&s;on, even to this day, at Oxford; to remind the people of that part of the year, which ought to create mirth and gaiety; &s;uch as is &s;ketched out in &s;ome old books of offices, &s;uch as the Primer of Sa|li&s;bury, &endq;&amp;c.</Q> I leave it to the reader to draw the proper inference from this pa&s;&s;age; and &s;hall add, that I do not mean, by what I have advanced, to <HI>exclude</HI> Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s hypothe&s;is. Why may we not &s;uppo&s;e, by way of reconci|ling both opinions, that the Ford was common to <HI>horned</HI> cattle in general? Nay that even <HI>Cows</HI> had more concern in this ca&s;e than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;eems very probable from the name of the neighbouring village, <HI>Cowley</HI>.</P>
<P>Having thrown new light on a circum&s;tance which has occa&s;ioned &s;o much di&s;pute, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which was a proper introduction to the en&s;uing hi&s;tory, I now proceed to a parti|cular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>It is well known, that before Colleges were e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Students were lodged in private hou&s;es: at length places were &s;et apart for
<PB N="8" REF="7">
their reception, under the appellation of <HI>Ho&s;|pitia</HI>, or <HI>Ho&s;tels</HI>; in other words Inns, or Tip|ling Hou&s;es; or, as our colleges are at pre&s;ent, <HI>Places of Entertainment</HI>. Many of the&s;e &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and retain their original occupation. Modern writers, indeed, mention no more than Twenty Colleges, and Five Halls, in this ex|ten&s;ive Seat of Learning: But from a diligent enquiry, I have di&s;covered no le&s;s than
<LIST>
<HEAD>TWELVE HALLS, Never yet enumerated or de&s;cribed; namely,</HEAD>
<ITEM>TIT-UP HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>CLAY HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>CABBAGE HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>CATERPILLAR HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>STUMP HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>LEMON HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>FOX HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>FEATHER HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>KETTLE HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>TRIPE HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>WESTMINSTER HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>La&s;tly, to the&s;e we mu&s;t add, KIDNEY HALL,</ITEM>
</LIST>
Which has been long in e&s;teem as a noted <HI>Seminary</HI>; and has lately been re-founded by the Name of DIAMOND HALL.</P>
<P>With the&s;e HALLS we mu&s;t mention a Thirteenth, formely di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of REDCOCK HALL: This Hou&s;e has been
<PB N="9" REF="8">
for &s;ome years unhappily alienated from the purpo&s;es of Literature, and is at pre&s;ent inha|bited by two widow gentlewomen.</P>
<P>The notion is equally erroneous with regard to the number of our LIBRARIES. Be&s;ides tho&s;e of <HI>Radcliffe, Bodley</HI>, and the private col|leges, there have of late years been many Libraries founded in our <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;es</HI>, for the benefit of &s;uch of the Academics as have neg|lected, or lo&s;t, their Latin and Greek. In the&s;e u&s;eful Repo&s;itories, <HI>Grown-Gentlemen</HI> are accom|modated with the <HI>Cyclopaedia</HI>, in the mo&s;t expe|ditious and ea&s;y manner.&mdash;The MAGAZINES afford Hi&s;tory, Divinity, Philo&s;ophy, Mathe|matics, Geography, A&s;tronomy, Biography, Arts, Sciences, and Poetry.&mdash;The REVIEWS, form the complete Critic, without con&s;ulting the dry rules of Ari&s;totle, Quintilian, and Bo&s;&s;u; and enable the Student to pa&s;s his judgment on volumes which he never read, after the mo&s;t compendious method. &mdash;NOVELS &s;upply the place of experience, and give lectures of In|trigue and Gallantry. &mdash; OCCASIONAL POEMS diffu&s;e the itch of rhyming, and happily tempt many a young fellow to for&s;ake Logic, turn <HI>&s;mart</HI>, and commence Author, either in the Pa&s;toral, Lyric, or Elegiac way. &mdash; POLITICAL PAM|PHLETS teach the inexpediency of Continental
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Connections; that for the puni&s;hment of French Perfidy, we &s;hould wage perpetual war with that nation; and that our Conque&s;ts in America will rai&s;e the jealou&s;y of <HI>all Europe</HI>.</P>
<P>As there are here Books &s;uited to every Ta&s;te, &s;o there are Liquors adapted to every &s;pecies of reading. Amorous Tales may be peru&s;ed over <HI>Arrack Punch</HI> and <HI>Jellies</HI>; In&s;ipid Odes, over <HI>Orgeat</HI> or <HI>Capilaire</HI>; Politics, over <HI>Coffee</HI>; Divi|nity, over <HI>Port</HI>; and Defences of bad Generals, and bad Mini&s;ters, over <HI>Whipt Syllabubs</HI>. In a word, in the&s;e Libraries In&s;truction and Plea|&s;ure go hand in hand; and we may pronounce, in a literal &s;en&s;e, that Learning remains no longer a <HI>dry</HI> pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ancient and con&s;iderable of the&s;e, is that in New-College-Lane, founded by the memorable Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>. He was accordingly con&s;tituted the fir&s;t Librarian, and upon his re|tiring to the <HI>I&s;le of Wight</HI>, for the private pur|&s;uit of his Studies, was &s;ucceeded by Librarian <HI>Hadley</HI>, who, though now removed, &s;till ac|commodates <HI>Students</HI> on their way to <HI>London:</HI> and a <HI>female</HI> Librarian at pre&s;ent fills this im|portant department with applau&s;e.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>Manu&s;cripts</HI> of the&s;e Libraries, they are oblong folios, bound in
<PB N="11" REF="10">
parchment, lettered on the plan of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Common Place Book; are written by, and kept under the &s;ole care of the Librarian. The&s;e Manu&s;cripts, which in proce&s;s of time amount to many volumes, are carefully pre&s;erved in the <HI>Archives</HI> of each re&s;pective Library.</P>
<P>That the reader may not be &s;urprized at our mentioning a female Librarian in <HI>Oxford</HI>, (which indeed would be le&s;s extraordinary if Fellows of Colleges were allowed to marry) it mu&s;t be remarked, that the other Libraries, e&s;tabli&s;hed on this plan, viz. <HI>James</HI>'s, <HI>Tom</HI>'s, <HI>John</HI>'s, &amp;c. are al&s;o conducted by Females; who, though properly the <HI>Sub-Librarians</HI>, have u&s;urped the right of their Hu&s;bands in the exe|cution of this office.</P>
<P>The SCHOOLS of this Univer&s;ity are al&s;o more numerous than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed; among which we mu&s;t reckon three &s;pacious and &s;uperb Edifices, &s;ituated to the &s;outhward of the High-Street, 100 feet long, by 30 in breadth, vulgarly called <HI>Tennis Courts</HI>, where <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> is regularly performed both morning and afternoon. Add to the&s;e, certain Schools, familiarly denominated <HI>Billiard Tables</HI>, where the <HI>Laws of Motion</HI> are exemplified, and which may be con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplement to
<PB N="12" REF="11">
our Cour&s;es of Experimental Philo&s;ophy. Nor mu&s;t we omit the many <HI>Nine-pin</HI> and <HI>Skittle Alleys</HI>, open and dry, for the in&s;truction of Scholars in Geometrical Knowledge, and par|ticularly, for proving the <HI>centripetal</HI> principle.</P>
<P>Other SCHOOLS, and places of Academical Di&s;cipline, not generally known as &s;uch, may be mentioned. &mdash; The <HI>Peripatetics</HI> execute the Cour&s;es proper to their Sy&s;tem upon the <HI>Parade</HI>. NAVIGATION is learnt on the <HI>I&s;is</HI>; GUNNERY on the adjacent Hills; HORSEMANSHIP on <HI>Port-Meadow, Bullington-Green</HI>, the <HI>Henley, Wycombe, Wood&s;tock, Abingdon</HI>, and <HI>Banbury</HI> Roads. The <HI>Axis in Peritrochio</HI> is admirably illu&s;trated by a <HI>Scheme</HI> in a <HI>Phaeton</HI>. The Doctrine of the SCREW is practically explained mo&s;t evenings in the private Rooms, together with the <HI>Motion of Fluids</HI>.</P>
<P>An inqui&s;itive ob&s;erver mu&s;t likewi&s;e have remarked many Public Edifices, and other Curi|o&s;ities, too frequently, but unju&s;tly, neglected and overlooked, which ornament our &s;treets The fir&s;t I &s;hall take notice of, is, that formi|dable cruciform Structure of Wood, in the <HI>Corn-Market</HI>; having three rotund apertures on the vertical, or traver&s;e, <HI>Head-Board</HI>. &mdash; It i$ &s;urprizing that this Edifice &s;hould have &s;o long

<HEAD>This Structure formerly &s;tood on the South Side of <HI>Carfax Conduit;</HI> from whence it was removed to the <HI>City-Hill</HI>, as a more convenient Situation, in the <HI>MAYORALTY</HI> of <HI>THOMAS MUNDAY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> Anno <HI>M.DCC.XLIX.</HI></HEAD>

e&s;caped ob&s;ervation in a Place of Literature: An Edifice, with which the Learned, and parti|cularly the Poets, according to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>, have been often <HI>clo&s;ely connected</HI>.</P>
<P>Nearly contiguous to this Edifice, &s;tands another le&s;s elevated Pile, con&s;tructed of the &s;ame materials, but better calculated for <HI>Society</HI>; though in&s;tituted upon the Principles of <HI>Sobriety</HI>. In both of the&s;e re&s;pectively, as the Statute in that ca&s;e directs, Offenders <HI>manibus pedibu&s;que plectuntur</HI>. But we refer the reader to the Prints annexed, which are delineated with the utmo&s;t accury.</P>
<P>In this neighbourhood, adjoining to the Ea&s;t End of <HI>Carfax Church</HI>, are to be found the imperfect Traces of a Place properly de|dicated to the MUSES, and de&s;cribed in our Statutes, by the familiar but forbidding deno|mination of PENNYLESS-BENCH. Hi&s;tory and Tradition, report, that many eminent Poets have been <HI>Benchers</HI> here. To this <HI>Seat</HI> of the Mu&s;es, we are mo&s;t probably indebted for that celebrated Poem, the <HI>Splendid Shilling</HI> of Phillips: And that the Author of the PANEGYRIC <HI>on Oxford Ale</HI>, was no Stranger to this in&s;piring <HI>Bench</HI>, may be concluded from
<PB N="16" REF="15">
the&s;e Ver&s;es, where he addre&s;&s;es the God, or Godde&s;s, of TICKING,
<Q><L>"Beneath thy &s;helter <HI>Pennyle&s;s</HI> I quaff</L>
<L>"The cheering Cup." &mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>We wi&s;h &s;ome future Genius may ari&s;e, to lament the change which Modern Barbari&s;m has produced in this valuable Antiquity. &mdash; Nothing which formerly belonged to it now remains, except two ferocious Warriors, clad in Coats of Mail, originally placed above, to admoni&s;h the <HI>Loiterers</HI>, by their &s;ignificant &s;trokes at ju&s;t intervals, of the rapid flight of Time; as is repre&s;ented in the annexed Cut.</P>
<P>The original Pavement of the <HI>Cla&s;&s;ic</HI> Ground beneath, has not indeed been de&s;troyed; but the <HI>Seat</HI> it&s;elf has been rudely torn away, and the Ho&s;pitable Covering which formerly pro|tected the Sons of Contemplative Indigence, is at pre&s;ent abridged to an u&s;ele&s;s &s;canty <HI>Border</HI>, which looks like an <HI>Apology</HI> for the Deva&s;tation <HI>committed</HI> upon the former venerable Canopy.</P>
<P>At no very great di&s;tance, in the High-&s;treet, we find an antique COLUMN of a tetragonal con&s;truction, oppo&s;ite to a venerable Gothic

Building, called the <HI>Black Pot Hou&s;e</HI>. This Column, at pre&s;ent &s;upplies the neighbouring inhabitants with Water, by means of an Engine artfully inclo&s;ed in the mid&s;t of it; and as it &s;till retains on it's top, two di&s;tinct Heads or Bu&s;tos, has acquired the vulgar appellation of the <HI>Two-faced Pump</HI>. &mdash; Various have been the Conjectures of the Learned concerning this in|e&s;timable Piece of Antiquity. The late indu&s;|trious and indefatigable Dr. <HI>Rawlin&s;on</HI> affirms it to have been a complete and genuine <HI>Roman</HI> PRIAPUS, but &s;u&s;pects that the <HI>Members</HI> have been impaired <HI>vitio Temporis</HI>. Others imagine that the <HI>double Front</HI> indicates a Statue of JANUS: But the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Hypothe&s;is &s;eems to be that of the truly ingenious Author of the MALLARD, who has di&s;covered, that this Column is a ju&s;t Matrimonial Emblem; as it plainly exhibits the Faces of a Man and Woman, but of a very <HI>&s;our A&s;pect</HI>, and <HI>reverted from each other</HI>. This Hieroglyphic, he con|ceives is coeval with the Univer&s;ity; and ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;es, that it was here erected in the mo&s;t public part of the Place, as a monitory <HI>Memento</HI> to the Gown&s;men, recommending <HI>Celibacy</HI>, and a <HI>mona&s;tic Life</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">Be&s;ides the&s;e curious particulars, ob&s;ervable in the Principal Streets, there are many others in the remote parts of the Town, which equally de&s;erve illu&s;tration. &mdash; Science diffu&s;es it's benign influence over the Suburbs of <HI>Oxford</HI>; in which &s;tands a famous College, founded as early as the Conque&s;t, where WISDOM may be truly &s;aid to pre&s;ide. The Students of this Hou&s;e are always <HI>re&s;ident</HI>, and are lectured in ETHICS a|lone, on the &s;ubjects of <HI>Temperance, Humility, Patience</HI>, and other Virtues proper to Students of this Cla&s;s. &mdash; Before the College-Gates, is the Place, where the fir&s;t Proce&s;s is performed on Bodies intended for the <HI>Anatomical Lectures</HI>.</P>
<P>We&s;tward of this <HI>College</HI> is the <HI>Dentrific Elaboratory</HI> of the celebrated <HI>Profe&s;&s;or</HI> WEBB. The Portico is decorated with a <HI>&s;ymbolical Painting</HI>, and an <HI>explanatory In&s;cription</HI>. This di&s;tingui&s;hed <HI>Denti&s;t</HI>, and <HI>Dentologi&s;t</HI>, co-operates with his Brother Profe&s;&s;ors, in the arduous and important Bu&s;ine&s;s, according to Mr. <HI>Paul Jullian</HI>'s phra&s;e, of <HI>Rectifying Deficient Heads</HI>.</P>
<P>In this Quarter of the Town, the Curious are likewi&s;e invited to vi&s;it an antique Pothou&s;e, known by the Hi&s;torical Sign of <HI>Whittington and his Cat</HI>. Here that laborious Antiquarian,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Mr. <HI>Thomas Hearn</HI>, one evening, &s;uffered him|&s;elf to be overtaken in Liquor. But it &s;hould be remembered, that this Accident was more owing to his Love of Antiquity than of Ale. It happened that the Kitchen where He and his Companion were &s;itting, was neatly paved with <HI>Sheep's Trotters</HI>, di&s;po&s;ed in various Compartments. After one Pipe, Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>, con&s;i&s;tently with his u&s;ual Gravity and Sobriety, propo&s;ed to depart; but his Friend, who was inclined to enjoy more of his Company, art|fully ob&s;erved, that the Floor on which they were then &s;itting, was no le&s;s than an original <HI>te&s;&s;ellated Roman Pavement</HI>. Out of re&s;pect to Cla&s;&s;ic Ground, and on recollection that the <HI>Stunsfield Roman Pavement</HI>, on which he had ju&s;t publi&s;hed a Di&s;&s;ertation, was dedicated to <HI>Bacchus</HI>, our Antiquary chearfully complied: an enthu|&s;ia&s;tic Tran&s;port &s;eized his Imagination; he fell on his knees, and ki&s;&s;ed the &s;acred earth, on which, in a few hours, and after a few tan|kards, by a &s;ort of Sympathetic Attraction, he was obliged to repo&s;e for &s;ome part of the evening. His Friend was probably in the &s;ame condition: but two Printers accidentally coming in, conducted Mr. <HI>Hearn</HI>, betwixt them, to <HI>Edmund Hall</HI>, with much &s;tate and &s;olemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">As an Appendage to a Pari&s;h Church in the Northern Suburb, we find a &s;mall, but com|modious Structure, dedicated to <HI>Hymen</HI>, who&s;e Votaries are here kindly introduced to the My&s;teries of that Deity, and receive their fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;port.

The Pro&s;pect, I con|fe&s;s, is exten&s;ive, various, and beautiful: But I am apt to &s;u&s;pect that <HI>Cumner-Hur&s;t</HI>, and other Eminencies which bend northward, and are very opake bodies, mu&s;t intercept Mr. <HI>Lenthall</HI>'s at <HI>Burford, Blandford Lodge</HI>, Lady <HI>Wheat</HI>'s at <HI>Glympton</HI>, Lord <HI>Guildford</HI>'s at <HI>Wroxton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Keck</HI>'s at <HI>Great-Tew</HI>, Mr. <HI>Page</HI>'s at <HI>North-A&s;ton</HI>, &amp;c. &mdash; I cannot apprehend that <HI>Sherborne-Ca&s;tle</HI>, the Seat of Lord <HI>Macclesfield</HI>, or Lord <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s at <HI>Newnham</HI>, are vi&s;ible in the cleare&s;t Day. Nor is it agreed on all hands that Mr. <HI>Whorwood's</HI> at <HI>Holton</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Schutz</HI>'s at <HI>Shotover</HI>, are di&s;cern|ible, even with the help of a Tele&s;cope.</P>
<P><Q>The &s;ame writer indeed, very ju&s;tly remarks, that this Garden &startq;has &s;everal Canals, and <HI>Fi&s;h|ponds</HI>, and that it is adorned by it's learned Owner with many <HI>modern antiquities</HI> of various &endq;Kinds and Countries.</Q>&mdash; But as the reader cannot collect any clear or di&s;tinct Information from &s;o general a Detail, I &s;hall add, that one of the <HI>modern antiquities</HI> here hinted at, is a <HI>Druidical</HI> Temple, lately erected upon the plan of Dr. <HI>Stukely</HI>. This Temple may be properly &s;tiled a <HI>modern</HI> Antiquity, on more accounts than one: it is undoubtedly a true Specimen of <HI>Druidical</HI> Architecture, but it is mo&s;t unluckily

&s;haded by a <HI>Walnut-tree</HI> in&s;tead of an <HI>Oak</HI>. I cannot help mentioning with &s;ome concern, that &s;uch an <HI>Innovation</HI> in the Garden of a <HI>real</HI> Anti|quarian is a <HI>bad</HI> precedent, and may be attended with pernicious Con&s;equences: although I have been informed, that, to palliate the matter, the <HI>learned Owner</HI> has more than once inoculated this Walnut Tree with a &s;lip of genuine <HI>Welch Mi&s;lletoe</HI>, but without Effect. &mdash; As then they are incompatible <HI>together</HI>, I would advi&s;e him either to de&s;troy the Temple or the Tree: and by this means, in vindication of his character, the real truth would appear to the world, whe|ther he loves <HI>Wallnuts</HI> or <HI>Antiquity</HI> be&s;t. &mdash; In a word, was any other <HI>modern</HI> Antiquarian to place a circular Series of Stones, under <HI>Jo. Pullen</HI>'s <HI>Tree</HI>, on <HI>Heddington-Hill</HI>, the incon&s;i&s;t|ency would be obvious to all our <HI>young Antiqua|rians</HI>, who con&s;tantly vi&s;it it Morning and Af|ternoon: notwith&s;tanding that venerable Elm, in con&s;ideration of its learned $$anter, its Beauty, its eminent Situation, academical Connections, and other re&s;pectable Circum&s;tances, has a fairer claim than mo&s;t Trees, to be dignified with <HI>Druidical</HI> Honours, and be made the <HI>Repre&s;entative</HI> of an <HI>Oak</HI>.</P>
