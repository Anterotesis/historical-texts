<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. Quin.</STAGE>
<L>WHEN this deci&s;ive Night, at length, appears,</L>
<L>The Night of every Author's Hopes and Fears;</L>
<L>What Shifts, to bribe Applau&s;e, poor Poets try?</L>
<L>In all the Forms of Wit they court and lye:</L>
<L>The&s;e meanly beg it, as an Alms; and Tho&s;e,</L>
<L>By boa&s;tful Blu&s;ter, dazzle and impo&s;e.</L>
<L>Nor poorly fearful, nor &s;ecurely vain;</L>
<L>Ours would, by hone&s;t Ways, that Grace obtain:</L>
<L>Would, as a Free-born Wit, be fairly try'd:</L>
<L>And then&mdash;let Truth and Candour, fair, decide.</L>
<L>He courts no Friend, who blindly comes to prai&s;e;</L>
<L>He dreads no Foe&mdash;but whom his Faults may rai&s;e.</L>
<L>Indulge a generous Pride, that bids him own,</L>
<L>He aims to plea&s;e, by noble Means, alone:</L>
<L>By what may win the Judgment, wake the Heart,</L>
<L>In&s;piring Nature, and directing Art:</L>
<L>By Scenes, &s;o wrought, &s;o rais'd, as may command</L>
<L>Applau&s;e, more from the Head, than from the Hand.</L>
<L>Important is the Moral we wou'd teach:</L>
<L>(Oh may this I&s;land practi&s;e what we preach!)</L>
<L>Vice, in its fir&s;t Approach, with Care to &s;hun;</L>
<L>The Wretch, who once engages, is undone.</L>
<L>Crimes lead to greater Crimes, and link &s;o &s;treight,</L>
<L>What fir&s;t was Accident, at la&s;t is Fate:</L>
<L>Th' unhappy Servant &s;inks into a Slave;</L>
<L>And Virtue's la&s;t &s;ad Strugglings cannot &s;ave.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. Cibber.</STAGE>
<L>OUR Bard, to Modern Epilogue a Foe,</L>
<L>Thinks &s;uch mean Mirth but deadens generous
Woe;</L>
<L>Di&s;pels in idle Air the Moral Sigh,</L>
<L>And weeps the tender Tear from Pity's Eye:</L>
<L>No more with &s;ocial Warmth the Bo&s;om burns;</L>
<L>But all th' unfeeling, &s;elfi&s;h Man returns.</L>
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Another Epilogue was &s;poken after the fir&s;t Repre&s;entation of the Play, which began with the fir&s;t &s;ix Lines of This: but the re&s;t of that Epilogue, having been very ju&s;tly di&s;liked by the Audience, This was &s;ub&s;tituted in its Place.</NOTE>
<L>Thus he began:&mdash;And you approv'd the Strain;</L>
<L>'Till the next Couplet &s;unk to light and vain.</L>
<L>You check'd him there.&mdash;To You, to Rea&s;on ju&s;t,</L>
<L>He owns he triumph'd in your kind Di&s;gu&s;t.</L>
<L>Charm'd by your Frown, by your Di&s;plea&s;ure grac'd,</L>
<L>He hails the ri&s;ing Virtue of your Ta&s;te.</L>
<L>Wide will it's Influence &s;pread, as &s;oon as known:</L>
<L>Truth, to be lov'd, needs only, to be &s;hown.</L>
<L>Confirm it, once, the Fa&s;hion to be good:</L>
<L>(Since Fe&s;hion leads the Fool, and awes the Rude)</L>
<L>No Perulance &s;hall wound the Publick Ear;</L>
<L>No Hand applaud what Honour &s;huns to hear;</L>
<L>No painful Blu&s;h the Mode&s;t Cheek &s;hall &s;tain;</L>
<L>The worthy Brea&s;t &s;hall heave with no di&s;dain.</L>
<L>Cha&s;tis'd to Decency, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage</L>
<L>Shall oft invite the Fair, invite the Sage:</L>
<L>Both &s;hall attend well-pleas'd, well-pleas'd depart;</L>
<L>Or if they doom the Ver&s;e, ab&s;olve the Heart.</L>
