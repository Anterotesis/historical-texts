<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONE might venture to pa&s;s a Judgment upon the Bill of Commerce, in &s;o far as it relates to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by compa|ring the &s;everal Memorials and Repre&s;entations given in to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade by the Royal Bur|rows (who are the Repre&s;entatives of the Trading People in <HI>Scotland)</HI> with the Articles of the Treaty, by which it will appear, that all they de&s;ired or was material for their Trade, was granted. Yet the Intere&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> in this Matter, will more di&s;tinctly appear, by com|paring the Circum&s;tances of the Trade of that Country after the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> in which it mu&s;t &s;till continue, with the Circum&s;tances it would have been in, if the Bill had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is certain and undeniable, that mo&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Goods and Mer|chandizes u&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> will be Imported there, notwith&s;tanding our Trade remains actually Prohibited, or in effect &s;o, by the heavy Duties in <HI>France;</HI> for in <HI>Scotland</HI> little other Wines or Brandies but <HI>French</HI> are drunk, and their Salt is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for our Fi&s;hing, that even in the time of War, we were &s;upplied with tho&s;e Commodities directly from <HI>France,</HI> or from <HI>Holland</HI> and other Places, and either entered them as coming from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> or &s;muggled them upon the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>As the Trade now &s;tands, we mu&s;t export Specie to purcha&s;e the Wines, Brandies, Salt, Paper,&amp;amp;c. which are the principal Commo|dities Imported from <HI>France</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> for our Woollen Manufac|tures, particularly our Serges, Fingrims, Stockings, Plaidens, Says, Stuffs, &amp;amp;c. and in general all Manufactures made or mixt with Wooll, Silk, Hair, Thread or Cotton, are now intirely Prohibited, all which might have been carried into <HI>France</HI> upon the ea&s;ie Duties in the Tariff of 1664, if the Bill had pa&s;&s;ed. For as to Broad-Cloth, Mill'd Serges and Ratins, which were put upon the Tariff of 1699. it is our Misfortune to have little of that Species of Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
As Matters &s;tand now, our Leather dre&s;s'd, curried or tanned Gloves, &amp;c. our Lead, and indeed all the Merchandizes made of Iron, Bra&s;s or Copper, are in like manner Prohibited in <HI>France,</HI> which might have been Imported upon rea&s;onable Duties, if the Bill had pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Our Hertings, had the Treaty taken Effect, might have been Impor|ted into <HI>France,</HI> paying the &s;ame Duty that the Dutch pay, (viz.) Six|teen Livres per La&s;t, which was &s;ecured by the Eighth Article of the Treaty, and all po&s;&s;ible Objections obviated by a Clau&s;e in the Bill; whereas now by the Arre&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> King, Anno 1701. we mu&s;t pay 80 Livres per La&s;t, which is five times more than the Dutch pay, and is equal to a Prohibition.</P>
<P>Our Salmon, which had the Treaty been made Effectual, would have paid by the Tariff of 1664. Six-Livres per Eight Barrels, mu&s;t now pay by the Arre&s;t of 1701. Forty Livres, which is five times as much.</P>
<P>Our Cod-Fi&s;h in Barrel, before the Tariff of 1664. paid a very in|con&s;iderable Duty, and by the Tariff of 1699. they are to pay Sixty Li|vres per La&s;t; whereas had this Treaty taken Effect, we were to have paid only Forty Livres per La&s;t, of 12 Barrel, weighing 300 l. weight each, over and above the &s;mall Duties payable before the Tariff of 1664. both which are con&s;iderably le&s;s than the afore&s;aid Duties in the Tariff of 1699. which we are now &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>Our Coal, which by the Tariff of 1664. would have paid Eight Sols per Barrel, mu&s;t now by the Arre&s;t of 1701. pay 30 Sols, which is near four times as much.</P>
<P>Our Green and Salted Hides, by the Tariff of 1664. would have only paid Ten Sols each; whereas by the Arre&s;t of 1701. they mu&s;t pay now Thirty Livres per Dozen, which is three times as much.</P>
<P>Calves Skins, by the Tariff of 1664. would have paid only four Sols per Dozen; whereas now by the Arre&s;t of 1701. they mu&s;t pay twelve Livres, which is Sixty times as much.</P>
<P>Our Glew, which is the Produce of our Skins, by the Tariff of 1664. would have paid Eighteen Sols per Hundred weight, which now by the Arre&s;t of 1701, mu&s;t pay twenty Livres, which is above twenty two times as much.</P>
<P>Our Butter, &s;ent from <HI>Kintire</HI> and other places of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whereof there were con&s;iderable quantities Exported, paid only by the Tariff of 1664. twelve Sols per Hundred weight, and by &s;ub&s;equent Arre&s;ts &s;ince 1664. it mu&s;t pay &s;ix Livres per Hundred weight, which is more than twelve times as much.</P>
<P>Our Beef, Pork, Tallow, Cow-Hair, Gla&s;s-Bottles, and &s;everal other
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Merchandizes from <HI>Scotland,</HI> will now by the heavy Duties impo&s;ed by the Edict of 1701. &s;tand in Effect Prohibited; which might have been Imported into <HI>France</HI> to good Advantage, had the Treaty been made Effectual.</P>
<P>And it is to be ob&s;erved, that before the pre&s;ent Treaty of Commerce, &s;everal kinds of Goods, packed in Casks, Che&s;ts or Ca&s;es, paid Duty by weight, without deduction of the weight of the Ca&s;es or Imbalages, &s;uch as Butter, Tallow, Copperas, &amp;c. and which was computed near a fifth part of the Duty: Whereas had this Treaty taken Effect, we had in all probability been ea&s;ed of that extraordinary Burden, which now we mu&s;t be &s;till &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>Before the Treaty of Commerce, there was 50 Sols, or rather 70 Sols, upon the Ton of Briti&s;h Ships, which was a great Di&s;couragement to our Navigation, and a great Advantage to the Dutch, who by the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI> obtained an Exemption from that heavy Duty, by which their Ships and Seamen were employed (being in a Condition to &s;erve upon cheaper Freights) while our Ships were laid up, and our Seamen left to &s;tarve at home, or &s;eek Employment abroad, which mu&s;t &s;till be the Ca&s;e now that Article in the Treaty of Commerce, which exemp|ted us from that heavy Duty of Tonage, by our not being able to &s;end out any Goods, in effect is &s;et a&s;ide. And it is ob&s;ervable, that tho' <HI>Scotland</HI> was of old free both from the Tonage in <HI>France,</HI> and of the Droit Aubein, by which the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ucceeds to the E&s;tates and Effects of Strangers dying in <HI>France,</HI> (which &s;evere Law the Dutch, by the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> were exempted from) yet &s;ince the Year 1688, the Duty of Tonnage has been exacted from the <HI>Scots:</HI> and no doubt the Droit Aubein will likewi&s;e be executed &s;o &s;oon as there is an Oppor|tunity; for in the Year 1701, a <HI>Scots</HI> Factor having le&s;t <HI>Paris,</HI> and gone to <HI>Italy</HI> upon the breaking out of the War, upon a Report of his being dead, his Effects were &s;eized, which obliged him to return to <HI>France</HI> to recover his Effects, by proving he was alive.</P>
<P>The Advantages <HI>Scotland</HI> would have had by the
Acce&s;&s;ion of the Plan|tation-Trade, and the Exporting of Tobacco, Sugar, Cotton, Dying Woods, &amp;c. into <HI>France</HI> upon rea&s;onable Duties, had the Treaty taken effect, are likewi&s;e very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The Encouragement we perceive by the Votes was intended for out Linnen Manufacture, by taking off the Duties upon Flax and Lin&s;ced Imported, and upon <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Linnen Exported, would have been very beneficial to our Country; which, with the many Advantages above|mentioned, we have forfeited by flinging out this Bill.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
To conclude: As all who pretend to know any thing of the Trade of this Country, are much concern'd at the Throwing-out of a Bill &s;o beneficial to <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;o they can't but admire the Conduct of &s;ome who appear'd &s;o warmly again&s;t our Intere&s;t. Tho&s;e who did it igno|rantly, ought to be forgiven; but if any, upon the account of Party, <HI>or per&s;onal Di&s;appointment,</HI> have thus &s;acrific'd their Nation's Intere&s;t, they cannot fail of &s;uitable Thanks from their Country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING read your Papers upon the Subject of the <HI>French</HI> Trade, I could not refrain giving you &s;ome few Hints, from the&s;e Parts, relating to the ill Share our Part of the Country is like to have in it: And this I conceived might be u&s;eful to you, when you &s;hould come to &s;peak of our Trade to <HI>France,</HI> as I under&s;tood by &s;ome of your <HI>MERCATORS</HI> you purpo&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>There are &s;everals of our Gentlemen now with you in <HI>England,</HI> who know well, That at the Treaty of Union, particularly when the Sixth Article of the Union came to be read in the Parliament on the 27th of <HI>November</HI> 1706, a very long Debate was had in the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament; anent the <HI>Scots</HI> being obliged to enter into the &s;ame Prohibitions as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and particularly the Wooll, &s;everal Speeches were then made in the Hou&s;e, repre&s;enting the Advantage of the <HI>French</HI> Trade to the Peo|ple of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and particularly tho&s;e Advantages were &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the <HI>French</HI> taking off from <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Fi&s;h and the Wooll. This was e&s;teemed &s;o great an Advantage to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that certain Gentlemen, &s;ome of them the &s;ame who are now actually again&s;t the pre&s;ent Treaty of Commerce, and making the Articles thereof Effectual, were then &s;o zealous for the Trade from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> that they brought the Propo&s;al into the Parliament the &s;aid 27th of <HI>November</HI> 1706, for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the Liberty of Exporting our Wooll into <HI>France,</HI> in the&s;e Words, as per the Minute of that Day.</P>
<P>Thereafter there was a Clau&s;e offer'd to be added to the &s;aid Sixth Ar|ticle, in the&s;e Terms: (Viz.) But <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the &s;pace of Years after
<PB N="7" REF="8">
the fir&s;t Day of <HI>May</HI> next, &s;hall be free from, and no ways &s;ubject to, the Prohibition and Re&s;trictions made again&s;t Exporting Wooll, Skins with Wooll upon them, and Woollen Yarn, which by the Oaths of the Sel|lers and Buyers &s;hall be made appear to be the proper Growth and Pro|duct of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;pun within the &s;ame, which &s;hall no ways be com|prehended under any of the Laws already made in <HI>England,</HI> or to be made during the &s;pace afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Speeches made in Parliament upon the Occa&s;ion of this Propo&s;al, &s;ignified, That <HI>Scotland</HI> having not a large Quantity of Ma|nufactures to an&s;wer the Imports from abroad, were obliged to Export their Wooll unmanufactur'd; and whereas by the Treaty of Union they would come under the &s;ame Denomination with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and have tho&s;e few Woollen Manufactures which they did make Prohi|bited in <HI>France,</HI> their whole Trade would be ruin'd, unle&s;s the Wooll was allow'd to be Imported: and e&s;pecially it was &s;aid, That the Wooll-Ma&s;ters, &s;uch we call in <HI>Scotland</HI> tho&s;e Gentlemen of the Shires of <HI>Gal|laway, Dumfries, Roxburgshire,</HI> &amp;c. who take their Rents in Wooll, would be impoveri&s;h'd in their E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Upon the refu&s;ing this Vote by the Parliament, another Vote follow'd on the 12th of <HI>November</HI> 1706. upon another Propo&s;al, (Viz.) That all Encouragement be provided for the Heretors in the Wooll Counties, in ca&s;e the Prohibition of the Exportation of Wooll be approved. This was the only Expedient which could be found out to appea&s;e the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Lo&s;s which they &s;uppo&s;ed the preventing the Exporta|tion of their Wooll and their Woollen Manufactures into <HI>France,</HI> would be to them by the Union. It is very &s;trange, any of the &s;ame Gentle|men &s;hould now be of the Opinion, that the laying open their Trade to <HI>France</HI> for all their Woollen Manufactures again, &s;hould now be of no Advantage to them.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the la&s;t mentioned Vote, you will find it in the Ar|ticles, that out of the equivalent Money to be given to <HI>Scotland</HI> for Lo&s;s by the Union, the Sum of 14000 l. was &s;et apart to be paid to the &s;aid Wooll-Ma&s;ters, after the Rate of 2000 l. per An. for &s;even Years, which is &s;aid to be appointed to encourage the Manufacturing the &s;aid Wooll in the Country, that &s;o the Stop of its Exportation might be no Lo&s;s to the Country.</P>
<P>Again, upon the farther Debating the &s;aid &s;ixth Article, and the eighth Article, &s;everal long Speeches were made in Parliament, particularly by the late Lord <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> the Laird <HI>Saltown,</HI> and others, &s;etting forth, That the <HI>French</HI> Trade was much more to the Advantage of <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
than the Trade to <HI>England</HI> could be, or than <HI>England</HI> could any way make us amends for. The&s;e Speeches may be &s;een in the 37th, 38th, and 39th Vote of Parliament, Publi&s;hed and Printed by Authority of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Not that the Exportation of Wooll was always free in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;e|veral Prohibitions having intervened, and &s;o al&s;o it might have been, had the Union not been concluded; but that tho&s;e Gentlemen who have &s;ince Argued again&s;t the Treaty for an open Trade with <HI>France,</HI> and admit|ting the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures into <HI>France</HI> upon the low Duties of 1664 were the &s;ame who Propo&s;ed and Voted for the above&s;aid Clau&s;e for Exporting the <HI>Scots</HI> Wooll Unmanufactured into <HI>France,</HI> is very plainly proven, from the Li&s;ts of tho&s;e who Voted APPROVE or not AP|PROVE, in the Minutes on the 6th and 8th Article of the Treaty, who&s;e Names al&s;o are Printed here, and are Entred in the Rolls or Re|gi&s;ters of Parliament.</P>
<P>Nor was this Point ea&s;ily parted with, but many Reflexions were made here on tho&s;e Members who were again&s;t the Clau&s;e for Exporting our Wooll; as what their Country lo&s;t a very great Advantage by.</P>
<P>In the Debates of the 16th of <HI>December,</HI> 1706. on the Eighth Report of the Committee appointed to Examine the 6th and 8th Articles of the Union, there were divers Speeches made to prove the <HI>French</HI> Trade much more to the Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than the Trade to <HI>England</HI> could be; where the Four chief Articles of the Exportation from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> were &s;aid to be Wooll, Leather, Lead and Fi&s;h; and upon the whole, it was offered in Parliament under two Heads, e&s;pecially by my Lord <HI>Beilbaven,</HI> 1. That <HI>Scotland</HI> got nothing by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade. 2. That <HI>Scotland</HI> were con&s;iderable Gainers by the <HI>French</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give you &s;ome farther Account of the&s;e Things in a Po&s;t or two. But by this you will &s;ee, that the &s;ame <HI>French</HI> Trade, which &s;ome of our People exclaim again&s;t now in <HI>England</HI> as advantageous to the <HI>French,</HI> and a Lo&s;s to their own Country, they could openly pu&s;h at when it &s;erv'd a Turn, and acknowledge to be &s;o advantageous to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> that they were willing to have a Law made to Export our Wooll to <HI>France</HI> unmanufactured, rather than not enjoy that <HI>French</HI> Trade which they acknowledged <HI>Scotland</HI> gain'd &s;o much Money by.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give you a larger Account of the&s;e Practices in a &s;hort while, if this proves of U&s;e to your Undertaking.</P>
