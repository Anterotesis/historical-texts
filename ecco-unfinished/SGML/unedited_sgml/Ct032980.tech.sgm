<P>IT is not without ju&s;t Ground, a Challenge of Peace
was made to the Nation in the Name of the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
that the World might know who were the Men,
in &s;pight of her Maje&s;ty's frequent Invitation to
<HI>Union,</HI> and the pre&s;&s;ing Exhortations &s;he had made from the
Throne for <HI>Peace,</HI> are con&s;tantly the Aggre&s;&s;ors, on every
occa&s;ion In&s;ult their Brethren, and prompt the Nation
to Unite in their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Has the Government &s;hown their Re&s;entment at the
Author of <HI>the Shorte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> either it
was for Injuring the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in &s;ugge&s;ting
that her Members intended &s;uch a thing as the De&s;tructi|on
of the Di&s;&s;enters; or el&s;e that noble Lord, who told
the Author of his Extraordinary Guilt, wou'd be puzzl'd
to find a Crime in it, and if it was for &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
'tis as hard, &s;ince 'tis too plain the Fact is true, and the
Charge ju&s;t, if any regard is to be given to the Preaching,
the Printing, or the Di&s;cour&s;e of the principal Clergy,
and mo&s;t noted Members of the Church.</P>
<P>From whence then I Inferr that the Author has no|thing
to ask pardon of the Church of <HI>England</HI> for, but
that he, like a too credulous Fool&punc; gave any heed to &s;uch
&s;light and cur&s;ory things as <HI>Preaching,</HI> and <HI>Printing</HI> of
Books.</P>
<P>What tho' a Reverend B&mdash;op had frequently &s;aid we &s;hou'd
never be well in <HI>England,</HI> till all the Di&s;&s;enters were
&s;erv'd as the <HI>Hug$nots</HI> in <HI>France?</HI> What tho' E&s;&abque; <HI>M</HI>&mdash;has
given it under his Hand, that he heartily prays God wou'd
give her Maje&s;ty the Grace to put all that was wrote there
in the Book call'd, <HI>the Shorte&s;t Way</HI> in Execution? What tho'
Dr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;frequently has Preach'd and Printed too, that the
Di&s;&s;enters were a Brood of Traytors, and the Spawn of
Rebels, and not fit to live? What tho' the Author of whom
we are now treating has declar'd from the Pulpit, that a
Man can't be a true Son of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but
he mu&s;t lift up the bloody Flag again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters;
yet &s;ince Printing Books is but a Modern Contrivance
<HI>to get a Penny,</HI> and ought to be prepar'd &s;o as may
be&s;t &s;uit the Market, and Sermons are only long
Speeches directed to, and made to plea&s;e the Auditory,
and con&s;equently &s;uited to their Circum&s;tances and Hu|mour,
it does not therefore follow, that becau&s;e they
have Preach'd and Printed the&s;e things, they really In|tended
and De&s;ign'd the thing, <HI>no, Good Men,</HI> it was far
from their Thoughts. The Author therefore was mo&s;t
ju&s;tly puni&s;h'd for his Folly, in believing any thing they
&s;aid, and pretending to Alarm the Di&s;&s;enters for the little
in&s;ignificant Performances of the Pulpit, or the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor are their cur&s;ory Di&s;cour&s;es of more weight, the
People are willing to plea&s;e them&s;elves with Rallying and
Bullying the Di&s;&s;enters, and make them&s;elves merry
<PB N="3" REF="5">
with &s;caring their Wives and Children, by telling them
they de&s;erve to be all Hang'd, Bani&s;h'd and De&s;troy'd;
but to think they are in earne&s;t, and mean as they &s;ay,
nothing can be more ab&s;ur'd, 'tis as Ridiculous as 'tis to
talk with <HI>Houghton</HI> the Apothecary, or <HI>S&mdash;ly</HI> the Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter;
'tis like Barking at a Dog, or if an A&s;s kicks a
Man, kicking him again; 'tis like fighting with a Chim|ney-Sweeper,
or &s;colding with a Fi&s;h-Woman; 'tis like
any thing that is Ridiculous, and therefore &s;till the Au|thor
of <HI>the Shorte&s;t Way</HI> was puni&s;h'd de&s;ervedly, for tel|ling
that Story in Earne&s;t which the Church-men Preach'd,
Printed, and talkt about only in Je&s;t.</P>
<P>But Gentlemen, if what you Preach, Print or Say be
in Earne&s;t, if you would have us believe you, and give
any heed to your Sermons, your Satyrs and Invectives,
if your <HI>Woolf Stript,</HI> your <HI>A&s;&s;ociations,</HI> your <HI>Peace and
Union,</HI> be of any weight, then 'tis no Scandal to affirm
that there is a barbarous De&s;ign on foot, in, and among
&s;ome who call them&s;elves the Members of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> to Extirpate and De&s;troy the Di&s;&s;enters, and to
do every thing by them that is Equivalent to what has
been call'd <HI>the Shorte&s;t Way,</HI> and con&s;equently that Author
was barbarou&s;ly Treated.</P>
<P>After all that has been done to dre&s;s up the Di&s;&s;en|ters
in the Fools Coat, to make all the Town Mock 'em,
and in the Knaves Coat, to make the Town hate them,
let 'em be now blacken'd with Trea&s;on, and the World
told they are dangerous to the Church, and to the Go|vernment,
and &s;o dre&s;t up in the Traytor's Coat in order
to &s;et the Mob upon them.</P>
<P>The whole Hou&s;e of Lords are abus'd, and the Bi&s;hops
Lampoon'd for not pa&s;&s;ing a Bill to Ruin them; nay, the
Queen has not &s;cap'd them, for her Maje&s;ty's Modera|tion
is the only pre&s;ent check to their In&s;olent Behaviour,
for this they tell us, &s;he has left them in the Lurch, and
for that rea&s;on the Reverend, but very Drunken Incumbent
<PB N="4" REF="6">
at <HI>Wickham</HI> left her Maje&s;ty out of his Graces after Meat
ever &s;ince, and wou'd ha left her out of the Prayers at
Church, but that he was afraid of his <HI>Dioce&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>Here is now a new attempt &s;tarted, which &s;trikes at
the Root of the Di&s;&s;enter's Intere&s;t, and is an effectual
way to de&s;troy the Succe&s;&s;ion of them in this Nation,
and that is, to prevent them Educating their Children in
their own Opinions, po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may be angry if I
&s;hou'd call this another <HI>Short Way;</HI> but I mu&s;t take leave
to &s;ay, that next to the Methods formerly propos'd in
the Book &s;o call'd, this is doubtle&s;s <HI>the Shorte&s;t Way with
the Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>If I &s;hou'd tell the World that there was an A&s;&s;ociation
form'd among &s;ome Gentlemen in the World to have fol|low'd
the <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> with an Act for di&s;abling all &s;uch
Mini&s;ters to Preach in <HI>England,</HI> as were not, for the
future, Educated in one of the two Univer&s;ities of <HI>Ox|ford</HI>
or <HI>Cambridge.</HI> If I &s;hou'd &s;ay that a Mercenary Re|negado
was hir'd to expo&s;e the private Accademies of
the Di&s;&s;enters, as Nur&s;eries of Rebellious Principles, I
&s;hou'd &s;ay nothing but what was in too many Mouths to
remain a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>I cou'd ea&s;ily run a parallel between the&s;e Gentlemen's
Proceedings, and tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> King's, when
he fir&s;t went the <HI>Shorte&s;t Way with the Prote&s;tants of</HI> France,
and could tell them that they &s;eem exactly to follow his
ble&s;&s;ed Example, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t to deprive them of all Offices
or Imployments in the State, then to take from them the
Education of their Children, and then to the pulling down
their Churches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o on to Gallows and Gallies;
that this was not the readie&s;t Method, the <HI>Shorte&s;t Way,</HI>
I &s;hall never deny, for the Wi&s;dom and Pollicy of that
Prince is unque&s;tionably Great; but that the&s;e Gentle|men
&s;hou'd pretend to the&s;e very &s;teps, and yet, at the
&s;ame time, be angry to be told they de&s;ign the re&s;t,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
is Impo&s;ing things upon the World too gro&s;s to go
down.</P>
<P>Wherefore I cannot but repeat it, that either the de|&s;ign
is the total De&s;truction of the Di&s;&s;enters as a Party,
or their Printing is meer Marketing, their Di&s;cour&s;e Banter,
and their Preaching Buffoonry.</P>
<P>For one of them to Treat us with good Words, and &s;ay
this is only to &s;ecure the Government, and there is no
harm meant the Di&s;&s;enters that are peaceable, they are
only excluded Preferment; and the other tell us, That
this de&s;ign of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their Schools does not Affect
the Di&s;&s;enters, they may &s;erve God according to the Tol|leration
their own Way, it only prevents Po&s;terity fol|lowing
their Method; this is &s;uch je&s;ting with the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
and &s;uch a civil way of telling them they are all
Fools, that it can hardly be allow'd to pa&s;s without a
a little Satyr upon the Non&s;ence of it.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>We&s;ly</HI> Author of two Pamphlets, Cal|culated
to blacken our Education in the Accademies of the
Di&s;&s;enters, Ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf Guilty of many
Crimes in his Youth, and is the willinger to Confe&s;s 'em,
as he would lay 'em at the Door of the Di&s;&s;enters and their
Schools, among whom he was Educated, tho', I humbly
conceive, it is no more a Proof of the Immorality of the
Di&s;&s;enters in their Schools <HI>that he was a little raki&s;h
among them,</HI> or that he found others among them like
him&s;elf, than the Hanging five Students of <HI>Cambridge</HI> in
a very &s;hort compa&s;s of time for Robbing on the High-Way,
&s;hou'd prove that Padding is a Science taught in
that Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>He takes a great deal of pains al&s;o to prove, that in
tho&s;e Accademies were, or are taught Antimonarchical
Principles, the Author of the&s;e Sheets happens to be one
that had, what little Education he can pretend to, un|der
the &s;ame Ma&s;ter that Gentleman was Taught by, <HI>viz.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Charles Morton</HI> of <HI>Newington Green,</HI> and I have now
<PB N="6" REF="8">
by me the Manu&s;cripts of Science the Exerci&s;es and Actions
of his School, and, among the re&s;t, tho&s;e of Politicks in
particular, and I mu&s;t do that learned Gentleman's memo|ry
that Ju&s;tice to affirm, that neither in his Sy&s;tem of
Politicks Government and Di&s;cipline, or in any other
the Exerci&s;es of that School, was there any thing Taught
or Encourag'd, that was Antimonarchical, or De&s;tructive
to the Government, or Con&s;titution of <HI>England;</HI> and
particularly among the Performances of that School, I
find a Declamation relating to the benefit of a &s;ingle
Per&s;on in a Common-Wealth, wherein it is declar'd and
prov'd from Hi&s;tory and Rea&s;on, that Monarchy is the
be&s;t Government, and the be&s;t &s;uited to the Nature of
Government, and the Defence of Property; which Di&s;|cour&s;e,
together with the &s;aid Manu&s;cripts, Sy&s;tem of
Politicks and Government, as Read in that School, and
which are now above 25 Years old, are left at the Pub|li&s;hers
of this Book for any one to peru&s;e, as a Satisfa|ction
of the truth of Fact.</P>
<P>Allow then this Gentleman fell into ill Company af|terward,
allow we had, and &s;till have wor&s;e Rakes a|mong
us than him&s;elf, does this prove that our Schools
teach Men thus, and that the Di&s;&s;enters in general pro|fe&s;s
Principles De&s;tructive of Monarchy.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Friend,</HI> and <HI>Sir William Parkins,</HI> were Hang'd
for Contriving to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the late King <HI>William,</HI> and
the&s;e Gentlemen dy'd Church of <HI>England</HI>-men, and Prote|&s;tants,
does it follow that the Church of <HI>England</HI> therefore
Owns or Profe&s;&s;es <HI>the Doctrin of the Dagger,</HI> teaches A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination
of Princes, and the like.</P>
<P>The Schools of the Di&s;&s;enters are not &s;o private but
they may be known, they are not a&s;ham'd of their Per|formances,
but that any Gentleman of the Church, or
any Man of Letters, may be admitted to &s;ee and hear
what they Teach, and what the Pupils Act there.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">

becau&s;e, for ought we know, they are Guilty, without
Examining the Truth of Fact; and if it were True in
one, or more, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all the re&s;t&mdash;. But this is
Ch&mdash;ch Ju&s;tice; this is the effect of our Men of Temper,
and their Civillity to their Neighbours.</P>
<P>And if the De&s;truction of the Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t was
not in this De&s;ign, why is not the Examination dire|cted,
the Guilt prov'd, the Guilty &s;ingl'd out, and
Expos'd, or the Slander Silenc'd?</P>
<P>And when all is done, Gentlemen, why do we erect
private Accademies, and Teach our Children by them|&s;elves,
even for the &s;ame Rea&s;on that we don't Commu|nicate
with you, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e you &s;hut us Out, and
Exclude us, by Impo&s;ing unrea&s;onable Terms. Open a
Door to us in your Univer&s;ities, and let our Youth be
fairly admitted to Study there, without Impo&s;ing Oaths
and Obligations upon them, and it &s;hall no more be
&s;aid that we erect Schools in oppo&s;ition to you. 'Tis
confe&s;s'd, we wou'd ask you to Reform the Univer&s;ity
Morals a little, as to the Trifles of Drunkenne&s;s' and
Leudne&s;s, if it might be; but upon a Freedom of Study
without Unju&s;t and Unfair Terms, and Oaths Impos'd,
we wou'd venture their Morals, and it &s;hou'd not be our
Faults, if your Univer&s;ities had not 2000 of our Children
always there.</P>
<P>Or if you refu&s;e us this Liberty, give us leave to
Erect Foundations of our own there, and to Endow them
our Selves, give our Youth leave to &s;tudy there Subject
to all General Offices and Rules of the Univer&s;ity, and
only Free within Doors, and you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee we will
neither injure your Univer&s;ity, nor &s;et up others of
our own.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
But while you &s;hut our Children out of your Schools,
never Quarrel at our Teaching them at Schools of our
own, or &s;ending 'em into Foreign Countries to be Taught,
&s;ince wherever they are Taught they generally get
a &s;hare of Learning, at lea&s;t equal to your &s;elves, and,
we hope, partake of as much Hone&s;ty; and as to their
Performances <HI>Match them</HI> and Out-preach them if
you can; I wi&s;h that was the only &s;trife between us.</P>
<P>Upon this Article Mr. <HI>Sachevrell</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI> has blown
his &s;econd Trumpet, to let us know he has not yet taken
down his Bloody Flag, and that he was the Real Author
of the <HI>Shorte&s;t Way,</HI> tho' another was Puni&s;h'd for it, and
we &s;ee he has the face to let them know, he is &s;till of the
&s;ame mind.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am a little &s;urpriz'd, to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Sachevrell</HI>
begin his Sermon with a Tenent long exploded by the
Church, till they found them&s;elves a little Embarra&s;s'd
with it. In &s;hort, 'tis a Whiggi&s;h Principle, and I am
glad to have his Voucher to Confirm it, this Gen|tleman
owns, in the very fir&s;t Lines, that <HI>the Regular Ad|mini&s;tration
of Ju&s;tice, is the Grand End and De&s;ign both of
Government and Law.</HI> P. fir&s;t.</P>
<P>If this be true it follows that Ju&s;tice <HI>which is
the End,</HI> is Superior to the King, that Executes, <HI>who
is the Means,</HI> for the End is always Superior to the Means,
and if this be true, Depo&s;ing Tyrannick evil Admini&s;tra|ting
Princes cannot be Criminal, becau&s;e they Overturn
and De&s;troy the end of Government, and the thing it
&s;elf mu&s;t fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>We thank him for this Conce&s;&s;ion, and hope he will
not take it ill if we find it convenient to Quote him upon
this occa&s;ion, in order to Confute &s;uch Authors who will
&s;till have it be the Doctrine of the <HI>C.</HI> of <HI>E.</HI> to &s;ubmit the
Laws and Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice ab&s;olutely to the Di&s;|po&s;e
of the Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
I am &s;till farther in his debt, for a Declaration again&s;t
a per&s;ecuting Spirit, <HI>P.</HI> 5. he tells us hone&s;tly, &startq;Who|ever
is Guilty of an unde&s;erv'd, unwarrantable Act of
Rigour, mu&s;t be pre&s;um'd to have a malicious Incli|nation.&endq;</P>
<P>To &s;tate this, I am forc'd to have recour&s;e to the Pre|amble
of the fir&s;t Occa&s;ional Bill, which ran thus,
&startq;Whereas Per&s;ecution, meerly on Account of Con&s;ci|ence,
is contrary to the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,
and to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.&endq;</HI>
This Gentleman confirms it, for if Per&s;ecution is con|trary
to the Chri&s;tian Religion, 'tis certainly an unde|&s;erv'd,
unwarrantable Rigor, and con&s;equently proceeds
from a malitious Inclination.</P>
<P>Why this Preamble was wholly left out in the &s;econd
Bill, I know not; nor will I affirm I believe it was from
what &s;ome have had Charity little enough to &s;ugge&s;t,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Bill being to contain the very e&s;&s;ence of
Per&s;ecution, they were loth it &s;hou'd be Condemn'd by
its own Title.</P>
<P>As to that little part of this Gentleman's Di&s;cour&s;e,
which he calls Sermon, or that has any Divinity in it I &s;hall
wave any Debate, his extraordinary Eloquence I acknow|ledge,
with gall not a little, and prejudice to extremity,
tho' Haranguing again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But as to the Je&s;t of the Sermon, the Farce in the Play,
the Buffoonry of it, I mu&s;t take it a little a-part.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> reducing his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Article of Pre|judice,
as it concerns Parties and Intere&s;t, he gives him|&s;elf
a loo&s;e to play the Mad-man a little, and Banter <HI>Oc|ca&s;ional
Conformity</HI> as the mo&s;t hideous Mon&s;ter that ever
appear'd in this part of the World; for An&s;wer to which,
I think 'tis enough to referr him back to the Reverend
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury</HI>'s Speech in the Hou&s;e of Lords, where
he proves 'twas the practice of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to ad|mit
of Per&s;ons of Different Religions into Places of Tru&s;t;
<PB N="10" REF="12">
if the Ca&s;e &s;till continu'd the <HI>Te&s;t</HI> wou'd cea&s;e, and Oc|ca&s;ional
Conformity dye of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Then he turns his Di&s;cour&s;e into Lampoon upon the
Bi&s;hops, and Taxes tho&s;e Reverend Gentlemen, with
Breaking their Oaths, betraying the Church they pre|tend
to &s;upport, and with favouring the Churches im|placable
Enemies the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>As to the Perjury of the Bi&s;hops, I cannot but ob&s;erve,
how cunningly this Gentleman has hook'd them in;
fir&s;t, he Taxes them for breaking their Oaths, and then
bewails the In&s;ufficiency of our Laws in puni&s;hing Per|jury;
and Exhorts the Judges, to whom he preach'd, to
prompt the Executing the utmo&s;t Severity in Ca&s;es of
Perjury, and to endeavour to have the Deficiency of the
Law &s;upply'd,
<Q>What is it, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that the Infatuation of Prejudice
will not per&s;wade Men to do: If it can prevail even upon
tho&s;e, who pretend to &s;upport our Church and Government,
in &s;pight of their Oaths and Obligations, to betray them,
<HI>P.</HI> 32.</Q>
Then running on in a &s;currilous Invective on the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
he concludes, <HI>Are the&s;e the Wolves in Sheeps Cloath|ing,
that are to be Invited and Complimented even by our
&s;uperiour Pa&s;tors into Chri&s;t's fold, to worry and devour it,</HI>

<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, can you prove that any of your Superiour
Pa&s;tors have Invited and Complimented the Di&s;&s;en|ters.</P>
<P>Secondly,
Can you prove they have Invited them in|to
Chri&s;t's Fold to Worry and Devour.</P>
<P>If neither of the&s;e be true, then the&s;e are two of the
po&s;itive Untruths, I am loath to &s;ay <HI>L&mdash;s,</HI> of which I'le
prove, you have in this one Sermon debauch'd the
Pulpit with about Fourteen, to the Scandal of the
Mini&s;terial Function, the Reproach of the Coat you
wear, and the open Di&s;covery of your Hone&s;ty and Tem|per:

As to the re&s;t, let my Lords, the Bi&s;hops, An&s;wer

<P>As to the Di&s;&s;enters, Sir, we expect no good Lan|guage

a Ma&s;s of Gall, mixt up to a Con&s;i&s;tency with Prejudice,
Envy, Pride, and ungovern'd Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And, indeed, Sir, on the&s;e Accounts the <HI>Zeal of the
Lord having &s;o eaten you up,</HI> as hardly to leave you your
Sen&s;es free from the Taint, we had never thought it
worth while to reply to &s;o much Rallery, and &s;uch Abu|&s;ive
Language, as things not fit for a rea&s;onable Man's
Notice, but for the &s;ake of tho&s;e hone&s;t Gentlemen's
Names who you put in the Front.</P>
<P>Now, as you are pleas'd to Dedicate your Book to
them, and to tell us it was at their Command you pub|li&s;h'd
it, 'twou'd ha tended much to the removing &s;ome
doubts in our Thoughts, if you had obtain'd, from tho&s;e
Gentlemen, a &s;hort &s;ignification of the true Rea&s;ons why
they ordered the publication, &s;ome People, who have the
honour to know &s;ome of them, being of Opinion that
<PB N="12" REF="14">
they did it meerly to banter you, and to let you give the
World the Character of your &s;elf; Others think tho&s;e
Gentlemen might think 'twas a Compliment you expect|ed,
and that &s;ince they knew you had prepar'd it for the
Pre&s;s, they were unwilling to deprive you of what 'tis
known you are extreamly fond of, I mean the appear|ing
in Print to the World.</P>
<P>Their Lord&s;hips the Judges, it &s;eems, are the only two
who had Kindne&s;s and Charity enough for you, not to
prompt you to make your &s;elf &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly publick, and
therefore we do not find my Ld Chief Baron <HI>Ward</HI> cou'd
be per&s;waded to be &s;o far acce&s;&s;ary to the expo&s;ing you.</P>
<P>But to enter upon the Matter I ask your leave, that
laying a&s;ide all other Debates about your Sermon, and
not troubling my &s;elf with the foulne&s;s of your Language,
and the bitter Invectives again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, as things
which do you little good, and your Argument le&s;s, I
&s;hall only tell you, Sir, the Ca&s;e in di&s;pute between the
Church and the Di&s;&s;enters on your &s;ide, is &s;upported very
much by Rudene&s;s and ill Manners, Opprobious Lan|guage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> but on our &s;ide needs it not.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore leave you to go on in your u&s;ual
&s;tream of Rallery and ill Words, and only inform the
World how the Pulpit, which claims a due Reverence to
Truth, and a needful caution as to Matter of Fact, has
had the misfortune to Patronize you in Affirming a
great many things which you cannot make out to be true.</P>
<Q>1. You Affirm this <HI>Phanatici&s;m,</HI> that is, the&s;e Opi|nions
of the Di&s;&s;enters, is <HI>nothing el&s;e but a mo&s;t
Full and Comprehen&s;ive Combination of all Wayward
and Diabollical prejudices,</HI> P. 31.</Q>
<P>Now, Sir, allowing that our Di&s;&s;enting from you were
ill Grounded in &s;ome Points, which, neverthele&s;s, I do
not grant, &s;ince we agree with you in all the Fundamen|tals
of Doctrine, and Sign to 36 of your 39 Articles of
Faith, how will you do to prove that our Di&s;&s;enting,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
which you call <HI>Phanatici&s;m,</HI> is nothing el&s;e but a full
Combination of all Prejudices; how you Compliment
Thirty Six of the Church Articles in this Ca&s;e,
to be part of this Combination I leave you to De|fend
at your Lei&s;ure? You have been taught, Sir, in
that Fountain of Learning, where you make your pre&s;ent
figure, a better kind of Logick than Affirming without
Proving; &s;o that till you prove our Principles to be <HI>No|thing
el&s;e but a Combination of all Prejudices,</HI> we mu&s;t crave
leave of you to &s;et this Affirmation of yours down, as a
Fal&s;hood, and figure it in order <HI>N^o.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, I demand you to prove that the&s;e Prejudices
of the Di&s;&s;enters are Diabolical.</P>
<P>If it wou'd &s;erve to convince you, I could bring you the
Te&s;timony of all the Eminent Per&s;ons of your own Church,
who have di&s;puted with us on the Heads of our Di&s;&s;ent|ing,
and none of 'em wou'd ever Advance a Notion &s;o
Black, &s;o full of Malice, and &s;o empty of Charity, that
we are under <HI>Diabolical Prejudices,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>can|not
be &s;av'd out of your Church,</HI> this is Popery in its Ex|alted
Extreams, and without u&s;ing much Compliment
with you, I affirm that the Di&s;&s;enters, Sir, are by all the
Rules from which a Chri&s;tian Man may judge within the
Compa&s;s of a way of Salvation, as much as the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> and that I may not, like you, affirm what I
cannot make out. I prove it thus,</P>
<P>They Profe&s;s the &s;ame Doctrine, the &s;ame Faith, the
&s;ame Saviour, and the &s;ame Bapti&s;m with your Selves,
and if the Faith in a Redeemer, which is one and exactly
alike in tho&s;e who are good Chri&s;tians, and believers on
either &s;ide, is effectual to &s;ave one, it mu&s;t be effectual to
&s;ave the other.</P>
<P>This po&s;ition therefore being as yet unprov'd, and the
contrary own'd by the Fathers and Doctors of your own
Church in all Ages, I mu&s;t mark it <HI>N^o.</HI> 4. and &s;et it down as
a meer Genuine Forgery of your own Brain, form'd in that
<PB N="14" REF="16">
very prejudice you pretend to Condemn, and advanc'd to
the World from a Heart full of Malice, thro' a Mouth full
of Cur&s;ing and Bitterne&s;s, without Argument, Proof,
Circum&s;tance or Probability.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, you go on in the very next words, for
every Line abounds with fal&s;hood, to tell us you can never
be &s;afe or &s;ecure from our re&s;tle&s;s and embroiling De&s;igns.</P>
<P>How, Sir, I cannot forbear asking you what are the&s;e
De&s;igns? We own the de&s;ign to enjoy our Liberty of
Wor&s;hiping God according to our Con&s;ciences, which, to
your great mortification, is now our Right by Law, and
which her Maje&s;ty, to your yet greater Di&s;appointment,
has promis'd us to Maintain and Continue, for which
you very fairly Unchurch'd her, and declar'd Her no
Friend to you, in another Invective of yours formerly
printed. We own al&s;o the De&s;ign of maintaining our
ju&s;t Rights and Privileges as Engli&s;h-men, and by all
lawful Means to oppo&s;e and &s;uppre&s;s all &s;orts of Tyrran|ny
and Oppre&s;&s;ion, as well Eccle&s;ia&s;tical as Civil.</P>
<P>As to all other De&s;igns, Sir, we Challenge you to prove
them, or any of them. We have always been upon the
Defen&s;ive with you; we have ever been attack'd, and
have only re&s;i&s;ted your Violence? You are the daily
Aggre&s;&s;ors, we Act nothing, or Say nothing, till you
force us by your furious and open Attempts upon our
ju&s;t Freedom, which you will always find us willing, and,
I hope, able to defend.</P>
<P>We can prove your Party Guilty of Plots, and Em|broiling
De&s;igns. We defy you to &s;how us one Di&s;&s;en|ter,
either in the late villainous Plot to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the
Nation's Deliverer, and the be&s;t King that ever &s;at on
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne, or in the pre&s;ent Con&s;piracy. But we
are ready to give you a Black Li&s;t, when you plea&s;e, of
Church of <HI>England</HI> Prote&s;tants in both, Leaguing with
<HI>France</HI> to Embroil the Government of their Native Coun|try,
Murther, and Depo&s;e their Lawful Prince, and In|$roduce
a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
To call upon you therefore for a Proof of the Em|broiling
De&s;igns of the Di&s;&s;enters, is but a ju&s;t return to
your Invidious Charge, and till you produce it, let that
&s;tand for a double fal&s;hood, <HI>N^o.</HI> 5 6.</P>
<P>To fill up that one Page of Scandal, and make it pa&s;s
for a true Libel, you go back to <HI>the never to be forgotten</HI>

<P>And why, Sir, <HI>never to beforgotten;</HI> her Maje&s;ty in

of Temper in your own Church tell us, the only way
to Peace is to lay a&s;ide former Annimo&s;ities, and Remem|brances
of pa&s;t Mi&s;chiefs. If they mu&s;t never be for|gotten,
pray, Sir, are you willing to recriminate, did we

but what you did to his Son; has not a noble Lord vouch|&s;afing
to turn Author, and write the Hi&s;tory of that Re|bellion,
has he not told us in the fir&s;t Part of his fir&s;t Vo|lume,
that the ill Conduct of that Prince brought all the
Calamities of Civil War upon his Head; had you done
le&s;s for his Son, if he had &s;taid and fought you as his Fa|ther
did? And did you do le&s;s when you fought him in
<HI>Ireland?</HI> How often have you been Challeng'd to bring
your Loyalty to the Te&s;t with us, and &s;ee who has rais'd
more Rebellions again&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Government, or
Murther'd more Princes, You, or We.</P>
<P>Let us look upon your pre&s;ent Proceedings, ...... you
&s;ay your poor Epi&s;copal Church in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;uffers Bar|barous
and Bloody U&s;age there, and that we never gave
the Church any Quarter when we had her in our power.</P>
<P>'Tis a Misfortune to you that your Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o outgoes
your Rea&s;on, that when you happen to be in, you will
be in, and not content to pa&s;s the Truth in one particular,
you forget it in all the particulars, for neither of the&s;e
Ca&s;es happen to have any &s;haddow of Truth in 'em.</P>
<P>The Barbari&s;ms and Bloody doings us'd with the Epi&s;|copal
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> amounted to &s;o few, that when
they repre&s;ented their Suffrings in an Addre&s;s to Her
Maje&s;ty, all the &s;ume of the Matter was &s;o Trivial, that
her Maje&s;ty &s;aw only Rea&s;on to Admoni&s;h them to more
Love and Charity with the Mini&s;ters of the National
Church, and to a due Submi&s;&s;ion to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Go|vernment.</P>
<P>To &s;tate this wonderful Grievance 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd,
That the Great pre&s;ent Quarrel is at the <HI>Scots</HI> E&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
and the Depo&s;ing Epi&s;copacy. This the <HI>Scots</HI> have
an undoubted Right to, the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment,
being the Original Prote&s;tant Settlement of that Nation,
into which they immediately Engaged at their fir&s;t Re|formation.</P>
<P>Epi&s;copacy is an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Encroachment upon them, and
was fir&s;t attempted by King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, about the
Year 1615, and &s;ince that, with great reluctancy, had
been &s;ubmitted to in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond,
but was Aboli&s;h'd by Act of Parliament at the Re|volution,
&s;tands now Expell'd, and her Maje&s;ty knows
too well the Rights of her People, to attempt its Re&s;to|ration
again&s;t the Con&s;titution of that Nation.</P>
<P>In which the ju&s;t regard her Maje&s;ty has to the Native
Rights of her People is Con&s;picious, and her Moderation
known to all the World.</P>
<P>But wou'd this Gentleman be willing we &s;hou'd inform
the World of the Patience with which the&s;e &s;ufferers bear
the Expul&s;ion of their Hierarchy, what In&s;ults of the
pre&s;ent Incumbents, what Tumults and Breaches of the
of the Peace, what Clamours and Threatnings do the
pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment there bear with every day? For
which we refer to the Letter from the general A&s;&s;embly
there to her Maje&s;ty, and the Accounts of Affairs daily
tran&s;mitted by Impartial Hands, and made publick.</P>
<P>As to the Bloody u&s;age of the Di&s;&s;enters there it is all
Forgery and Malice, and tho&s;e Severities that have been
<PB N="17" REF="19">
us'd with them, would ha$ been much le&s;s had they fir&s;t
&s;ubmitted to the Con&s;titution, taken the Oaths to the
Government, and made the di&s;pute meerly Religious.</P>
<P>And yet, con&s;idering the Bloody and Barbarous u&s;age
of the Di&s;&s;enters formerly in that Kingdom, <HI>the Truth
is,</HI> they had rea&s;on to expect little favour, &s;ince I believe
'tis ea&s;y to make it out, that more People have been
Murther'd under the Epi&s;copal Tyranny in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at
their Religious Meetings only, than the Bloody Reign of
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> formerly &s;acrific'd here on account of Popery
and Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>The&s;e therefore are po&s;itive untruths, your Church has
fair Quarter now in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Profe&s;&s;ion of it without
Te&s;ts, Sacraments or any Obligations, <HI>but that of the
Oath of Allegiance</HI> enjoy the advantage of Places and
Preferments, a thing we are denied here, and all this
Clamour, Sir, is &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to plain and demon|&s;trated
Truth, that we can Appeal even to the Queen's
Maje&s;ty her &s;elf, to te&s;tify for us, that you are mi&s;ta|ken,
and con&s;equently encrea&s;e the Li&s;t of Fal&s;ities to
<HI>N^o.</HI> 7 and 8.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;ely omit your bitter Invective at <HI>Occa&s;ional Con|formity,</HI>
and at your own Friends, for rejecting the Bill
again&s;t it, let the Bi&s;hops you have Lampoon'd, and the
Hou&s;e of Lords you have Arraign'd, An&s;wer you, as
thanks be to God they have effectually done.</P>
<P><HI>Then, Sir, you come in with another Forgery of your

of Moderation, &s;erve them&s;elves in a Twofold Way,
both upon the Church to Amu&s;e and ca&s;t it into a Dead Sleep,
and then like <HI>Dalila</HI> to let in the <HI>Phili&s;tins,</HI> by widening a
Breach in her Con&s;titution, Fir&s;t to weaken, and then to
overthrow it, and then on the Di&s;&s;enters, to encourage them
in their Sins, by mitigating Theirs and the Churches Diffe|rences,
and which is more A&s;toni&s;hing, by ju&s;tifying their damna|ble
Schi&s;m, <HI>and this ble&s;&s;ed Speech you bring to this &s;hort
Conclu&s;ion,</HI> what have the&s;e Men to do with <HI>Peace and Union?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">
Thus, Sir, you have lift up your Banner of Defiance
a &s;econd time, and in the Name of the Church you tell
us, we &s;hall have no <HI>Peace</HI> nor <HI>Union</HI> with you&mdash;we
are &s;orry for it, and if all the Church of <HI>England</HI> was of
your mind, we know what we had to expect; but ble&s;|&s;ed
be God, this is the Language only of one mad Prie&s;t,
<HI>a Fury</HI> made up of a Complication of Malice, intollera|ble
Pride, bigotted Zeal, and bloody Helli&s;h Unchri&s;tian
Principles, to whom I &s;hall Reply, in the Words of our
Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, to tho&s;e high &s;pirited pa&s;&s;ionate Di&s;ciples
that were for calling for fire from Heaven on the Jews.
<HI>Ye know not what Spirit you are of.</HI></P>
<P>But now, that the Di&s;&s;enters may not &s;tand alone, this
angry Gentleman, lets his Pa&s;&s;ion loo&s;e at all the Men of
Moderation in his own Church, and this la&s;t Paragraph
is a whole Satyr upon tho&s;e we call Low Church-men.</P>
<P>The&s;e, he &s;ays, under pretence of Moderation, ca&s;t the
Church into a dead Sleep, in order to overthrow the
Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><HI>N^o.</HI> 9. This &s;tands plain to be reckon'd a Notorious
Impo&s;ition upon 2 Millions of hone&s;t Gentlemen, who
not only are now, but at all times have been the Bul|wark
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and it mu&s;t remain to
me as a perfect Forgery, till he proves one Act, which
the Moderate Church-men ever did to overthrow the
Con&s;titution of the Church.</P>
<P>In the mean time while I leave this Gentleman to
prove his ha&s;ty Affirmative if he can, I &s;hall prove ano|ther
Affirmative, out of which the Negative to his a&s;&s;erti|on
will be plain by Con&s;equence, and this I take to be a
fair way of Di&s;puting, if he can tell me a fairer, I am
ready to join I&s;&s;ue with him.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Then I can prove that the&s;e Men of Modera|tion
have, when the Church has been reduc'd to the la&s;t
Extremity, been the only Refuge, Deliverance, and re|&s;torers
of the Church.</P>
<P>To go no farther back than the Bi&s;hops who were &s;ent

then Incumbent at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s in the Fields, and after this
the Bi&s;hops, who went to the <HI>Tower,</HI> becau&s;e they wou'd
not con&s;ent to a Su&s;pention of the Laws, and yet, at the

the Re&s;toration and E&s;tabli&s;hment of your Church, and in
particular, Sir, of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> of which,
if you write your &s;elf a Fellow, you ought not to be &s;o

Courage, Hone&s;ty and Temper, you now enjoy your Fel|low&s;hip,
the College her Foundation Settlement, the

Many In&s;tances more could be given you, in which

Courage of the Moderate Churchmen, when the Fury
of &s;uch Hot Spurs, as we are now talking to have brought

<P>And becau&s;e I purpo&s;e &s;hortly to vi&s;it them with a full
Draught of the Treaty between the Di&s;&s;enters in this
Ca&s;e, and &s;ome Truths which I perceive this Author
knows nothing of, I &s;hall be the &s;horter on this Head.</P>
<P>When in King <HI>James</HI> the Second's Time his Maje&s;ty
found, that in order to reduce the Church, it was his
bu&s;ine&s;s to Care&s;s the Di&s;&s;enters, and accordingly pub|li&s;h'd
an Immediate Indulgence, a great many of the Di&s;|&s;enters
made warm by their former &s;ufferings, clos'd eager|ly
with the Propo&s;als, and would willingly have &s;et their
Hand to the work; but when the Men of Temper, <HI>for
we do not deny to have &s;ome too violent Spirits among us,</HI>
came to con&s;ider the Ca&s;e, they found the de&s;ign &s;truck at
the whole Body of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> they con&s;idered
them as Prote&s;tants and Brethren, they con&s;idered the
Methods u&s;eing with them as De&s;tructive to the Laws,
as to the Church, and a Plot as well on Liberty as Reli|gion,
they immediately &s;topt &s;hort, and tho' they cou'd
not but accept of Liberty as their Right and Proper due
in matters of Religion, yet they could not con&s;ent to en|joy
it as a Ruine to the Law, and therefore vigorou&s;ly
oppos'd the taking off the Penal Laws, tho' they them|&s;elves
<PB N="22" REF="24">
were to reap the benefit of it. In this juncture
the Church finding the Root of her Con&s;titution &s;trook
at, and that if the Di&s;&s;enters were brought over to joyn
in the Attempt, &s;he &s;hould be undone without Remedy,
immediately apply'd to the Di&s;&s;enters, repre&s;ent to them
the de&s;ign as aim'd at the whole Prote&s;tant Body, call
upon them with a <HI>Proximus Ardet,</HI> and tell them of <HI>Poly|phemus</HI>'s
<HI>Courte&s;ie,</HI> call the Declaration of Indulgence a
<HI>Trojan</HI> Hor&s;e, and talk to them as Brethren and Fellow
Chri&s;tians all United in one Faith, Doctrine, Bapti&s;m,
hope of Life and Saviour, and at la&s;t come to the Point,
that if they would join with the Church to re&s;i&s;t Inva|ding
Popery, they would call in the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
and fight for their Liberty and Religion, and as to Diffe|rences,
they would call a healing Parliament, e&s;tabli&s;h In|dulgence
by Law, fix an eternal Liberty of Con&s;cience,
and from this time forward we &s;hould be all Brethren.</P>
<P>If you doubt, Sir, the Truth of this, either of the
Churches danger at that time, or the Di&s;&s;enters quitting
their Revenge, and the Promi&s;es of their Prince, Ex|amine
the College, of which you write Fellow, &s;ome of
your worthy Contemporaries can ju&s;tify all this and more.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you tru&s;ted us, and we never betray'd you.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, We tru&s;ted you, and you have betray'd us,
our Indulgence indeed you have perform'd, and we acquit
you of that, tho' we know what we owe in that Ca&s;e to K.
<HI>William,</HI> but where's the future Corre&s;pondence of Brethren
where the promis'd Temper? All this is forgot, and now,
when we &s;ay, is there Peace, you An&s;wer, with <HI>Jehu, What
Peace &s;o long as the Whoredomes of your Mother</HI> Jezabelle
<HI>continue,</HI> you cry, <HI>what have we $o do with</HI> Peace and Union?</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I think your A&s;&s;ertion is &s;ufficiently prov'd
fal&s;e, by proving we have been Tru&s;ted, and have not
betraid you, I wi&s;h you could defend the Treachery of
your Church from as plain an Example.</P>
<P>By the By, Sir, I mu&s;t Note a very Chri&s;tian-way of
Arguing in your 35th Page, when you come to ju&s;tify
your per&s;ecuting Spirit, <HI>As to Per&s;ecution of Tender Con&s;ci|ences,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="25">
&s;ay you, <HI>I appeal to the Hi&s;tories of our Kingdom, whe|ther
ever they gave the Church the lea&s;t Favour or Quarter,
when they had her under their power.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t fini&s;h my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e with you upon this
Head, and fir&s;t, I mu&s;t Debate the Chri&s;tian with you&mdash;Suppo&s;e
it were true that we had not, is it therefore ju&s;ti|fiable
that you mu&s;t per&s;ecute Tender Con&s;ciences?</P>
<P>To what degrees of madne&s;s does the unbounded fury
of Men's Pa&s;&s;ions lead them, is this, Sir, your Chri&s;tian
Religion, is this Church of <HI>England</HI> Religion, wou'd any
Man look for &s;uch Language in a Sermon again&s;t Prejudice.</P>
<P>I have noted in the beginning of this Book, that in the
Preface to the fir&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> you will find the&s;e Words,
<HI>Per&s;ecution of tender Con&s;ciences is contrary to the Principles of
the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P>Well, Gentlemen, but tho' it be both contrary to the
Chri&s;tian and the Church of <HI>England</HI> Man, yet you will
do it becau&s;e we <HI>never-&s;how'd you any Favour or Quarter
when we had you in our Power.</HI></P>
<P>Excellent Chri&s;tians, you will Revenge your &s;elves tho'
you act again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Principles, and the Doctrine
of your own Church.</P>
<P>But after all, Gentlemen, the excu&s;e for this Matter
happens to be fal&s;e too, for when we had you in our
Power in K. <HI>James</HI>'s time, we did &s;how you favour, and give
you Quarter, for we cho&s;e War for your &s;akes, and quitted
all the Promi&s;es and Advantages we had made and offered
us by your Adver&s;ary, and are rewarded like your Selves.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e your Glamours are &s;o Unju&s;t, that we
cannot but let you know that we are preparing an exacter
Hi&s;tory, both of our Treatment of you, and your Treat|ment
of us, which you &s;hall have a Monthly Pro&s;pect of,
in which all your Barbarities and Inju&s;tices, as well as In|gratitude
to the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;hall at large Appear.</P>
<P>And as we are forc'd to this Method to undeceive the
World, to whom &s;uch Incendiaries as you Mi&s;-repre&s;ent
us, &s;o you are notorion&s;ly the Agre&s;&s;ors in your con&s;tant
Endeavours to blacken us to Po&s;terity, and force us to
Expo&s;e you for our own ju&s;t Vindication.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">
We had much rather live in Peace, and Bury the Ini|quities
of our, and your Fathers, in &s;ilence with their
A&s;hes, but &s;ince you are always raking up the Actions
of the Dead, and valluing your &s;elves upon the Days of
41, we &s;hall trace you back to your Original, and bring
you to an exact Ballance, as to Rebellion, Loyalty, killing
of Kings, Per&s;ecution, Principles, Hone&s;ty and Charity,
and we declare our &s;elves content to &s;tand by the Foot
of the Account with you.</P>
<P>In the mean time we have been Advertiz'd in Print of
a <HI>Black Li&s;t,</HI> preparing for publick view of all the Suffer|ings
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy in the Rebellion
of 1641. and that all well wi&s;hers to the Nation's feuds
&s;hould &s;end in what Materials they have to rai&s;e the Bulk,
I take the freedom to give the Author Notice that we will
give them time to fini&s;h their de&s;ign, we will abate 'em
all Mr. <HI>Calamy</HI>'s 9 Chapter, of Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s Life, and 3000
Mini&s;ters &s;ilenc'd and turn'd out, we will, perhaps, add
&s;omething for them to the Li&s;t of their Sufferers, we will
throw them in 500000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling in the Account of Dama|ges,
we will quit them a Tun of Di&s;&s;enters Blood,
and abate them all the time they take to Mu&s;ter up their
Evidences, and, in the &s;hort &s;pace of 14 days after their
Publication, come to a fair Account of Per&s;ecution with
them, and the whole cau&s;e &s;hall turn upon the Ballance.</P>
<P>If this Challenge be not fair let them An&s;wer this, and
I'le make them yet a fairer.</P>
<P>And as I de&s;ign once a Month to give a particular of
the Mi&s;-repre&s;entations and ba&s;e Treatment the Di&s;&s;en|ters
receive from this Party, till I have gone thro' the
whole Hi&s;tory, &s;o I &s;hall produce &s;uch unan&s;werable Proofs,
&s;uch ju&s;t Authorities and plain Matter of Fact, that I have
no Apprehen$ion of being di&s;prov'd, having no need to
help out ou$ Cau&s;e with &s;o weak and di&s;advantageous
a &s;hift as the refuge of Lyes.</P>
